[0:01] good and many things many other reasons
[0:03] why that they would have had wine there
[0:05] at the wedding it was important it was a
[0:07] hot hot climate and it was mostly
[0:10] Outdoors that they would have this
[0:12] celebration and so it was very very
[0:14] important and it was but it was most
[0:16] important like you could survive it but
[0:19] it's most important for the attitude of
[0:21] the guests
[0:23] right for the happiness of the guests
[0:26] so if you think about it now if there's
[0:29] going to be a wedding going on the guest
[0:32] in order for the wedding to be what it
[0:34] should be the guest ought to be in the
[0:37] right attitude
[0:38] it's good no all right
[0:42] we've all been there where there was
[0:43] somebody disgruntled at the wedding I I
[0:45] remember our wedding and and I had some
[0:47] disgruntled family members not because
[0:49] of who I was married but they were
[0:50] fighting amongst themselves and and uh
[0:53] and some of our pictures are really
[0:55] curious because you've got very happy
[0:57] people and very mad people in the same
[0:59] picture
[1:01] and some of y'all maybe have had
[1:02] intended weddings like that and been
[1:04] like that and and uh and and so there
[1:07] had to be something to keep the attitude
[1:10] of the guests in in their proper place
[1:12] and I'll say Jesus is always on time to
[1:16] help us to make sure that we're where
[1:19] we're supposed to be even in our
[1:20] attitudes Even in our worship Even in
[1:23] our the Revival there's a moments he's
[1:25] always on time to do that brother Joe
[1:27] when we need him
[1:29] yeah
[1:30] do you believe that today
[1:33] amen so here at the evening time he
[1:37] didn't just he didn't just have a
[1:38] wedding now they could have had the
[1:40] wedding
[1:41] without the wine
[1:42] but it would have been a little bit sour
[1:45] a little bit grumpy
[1:47] people be a little disappointed
[1:50] now listen God could have come in this
[1:52] age he could have come and had the
[1:54] wedding and not sit and not poured out
[1:57] his Spirit come on not had any Revival
[2:00] right not having you could just sit
[2:02] there and I could teach you the message
[2:03] you could all sit there like bumps on a
[2:05] log and we could sit there and say well
[2:07] bless the Lord we're being married to
[2:09] Christ the lord we're being united and
[2:10] we could just all have like a classroom
[2:12] setting and a chalkboard we could do
[2:14] that but he cares about Oh my he cares
[2:17] about our attitude he cares about our
[2:20] faith level he cares about the Revival
[2:22] Among Us he wants us to be he wants us
[2:25] to worship him he wants us to he wants
[2:27] us to honor him in the way that we treat
[2:30] each other and everything else and so
[2:32] what does he do he provides wine at the
[2:34] wedding at the end time amen
[2:39] Hallelujah
[2:41] so now
[2:42] so the wine had run out and when they
[2:45] wanted wine or when they were out
[2:47] the mother of Jesus saith unto him
[2:50] they have no wine
[2:52] that's an interesting thing to say she
[2:54] knew who he was
[2:57] now this was a crisis again for that
[3:01] family at that time it's not like they'd
[3:03] go down to the store and buy a canned
[3:06] soda
[3:07] there wasn't any anywhere they could go
[3:09] the wine running out was a big deal yeah
[3:13] but their guest enjoyment at the wedding
[3:16] depended on the wine you could say it
[3:18] this way that the line was the life of
[3:20] the wedding
[3:24] now we know that Satan has always tried
[3:28] to control
[3:29] the spiritual life of the church
[3:33] he's always done that he tries to do
[3:36] that today he probably did that to you
[3:38] this morning or tried to
[3:40] he's always trying to dampen your
[3:43] spiritual enthusiasm for the word
[3:46] come on now that's his job
[3:48] you take a person will be on fire one
[3:50] day and excited and happy and the next
[3:52] day they start to back up and back up
[3:55] and usually because well there's
[3:56] something going on there's something
[3:58] troubling that person why would they why
[4:00] would that happen like that it's because
[4:02] Satan is trying to maybe he'll make you
[4:05] think well you're too emotional you're
[4:06] you you say too much in church and maybe
[4:09] you ought to sit quietly like everybody
[4:10] else and but what he's doing he's trying
[4:13] to dampen your enthusiasm for the word
[4:17] and he does that to all of us every day
[4:20] he does it he tries to get us where we
[4:22] won't speak out and we won't do we won't
[4:24] testify we won't come to church because
[4:26] we well it's just it's just not
[4:27] enjoyable anymore he wants to control
[4:29] the spiritual atmosphere but at times I
[4:32] think it's time we took Satan's hands
[4:34] off the thermostat and put a lock box on
[4:37] of the Holy Ghost and control the
[4:39] Atmosphere by the Holy Spirit
[4:41] to letting Satan do it
[4:45] Revelation six and five is how he did it
[4:48] in the dark ages in the opening of the
[4:50] third seal he said I heard the third
[4:52] Beast say come and see and I'll be held
[4:54] in lower Black Horse and he that sat on
[4:56] him had a pair of balances in his hand
[4:59] and I Heard a Voice in the midst of the
[5:01] four beasts say a measure of wheat for a
[5:03] penny the three measures of barley for a
[5:06] penny see thou hurt not the oil in the
[5:08] wine
[5:09] the Antichrist Spirit now listen to me
[5:12] church this is important this morning
[5:14] for all of us as a local church body
[5:17] this Antichrist Spirit had made Church a
[5:21] transaction
[5:24] that made the church service a
[5:27] transaction they made the sacraments a
[5:28] transaction legalism makes
[5:32] church and makes the your spiritual life
[5:35] a transaction
[5:37] something for something the Latin saying
[5:40] is quid pro quo which means something
[5:42] for something
[5:44] something for something this for that
[5:46] well if I go to church maybe maybe God
[5:49] will heal me man if I if I go to church
[5:51] maybe I won't be judged if I get
[5:55] baptized maybe I won't go to hell it's
[5:57] transactional
[5:59] right it's a pair of balances
[6:02] it's legalism and the Catholic church
[6:04] was the inventor of that
[6:06] right they're the ones that said well if
[6:08] you pay this much you'll get your soul
[6:10] out of hell out of purgatory and John
[6:13] pitzel walks around in that in that age
[6:15] in Martin Luther's time and he walked
[6:17] around selling indulgences to put up a
[6:19] cathedral in Rome and he said this as
[6:21] soon as the gold and the casket Rings
[6:23] the rescued soul to Heaven Springs
[6:26] transaction
[6:28] if you've ever seen the Martin Luther
[6:30] movie the one the Lutheran Church put
[6:31] out maybe 50 years ago I'll never forget
[6:34] that Martin Luther walks down the
[6:36] alleyway and here's an old drunk you
[6:38] know that I've been trying to do better
[6:39] and he's out there just as drunk as can
[6:41] be he said he said why are you acting
[6:43] like this he said didn't you know he
[6:45] said I'm free man I'm clear I can do
[6:47] whatever I want to
[6:49] said I paid my Indulgence
[6:51] I put my money in the Box
[6:54] oh my but don't you realize that when we
[6:57] try to reduce church when we try to
[6:59] reduce the gospel and we try to reduce
[7:01] the message to legalism it does the same
[7:04] thing
[7:05] it becomes a transaction because I pay
[7:07] my tithes then I can maybe I can come to
[7:09] church and feel good about myself no
[7:12] it's not a transaction I don't deserve
[7:14] one bit of his love I don't deserve one
[7:17] ounce of his Mercy I don't deserve any
[7:19] of his presence coming down on me so
[7:21] when he comes I'm going to worship him
[7:23] I'm going to praise him because I didn't
[7:25] do anything to earn it
[7:28] I don't have I'm not sitting here with a
[7:31] pair of balances weighing your works
[7:33] to see whether you get spiritual favors
[7:36] buddy
[7:41] yes sir
[7:42] he said his balances where scales was in
[7:46] his hands
[7:47] see what they did is they took the joy
[7:51] and spiritual life of the people and
[7:54] based it on on what they could do for
[7:56] the church
[7:57] instead of the finished work of Christ
[7:59] at Calvary
[8:03] oh my
[8:05] now look he said he's balances and
[8:08] scales his hand you see calling out a
[8:09] measure of wheat for a penny three
[8:11] measures of barley for a penny see
[8:13] actually that is wheat and barley is
[8:15] natural staff of life that's what bread
[8:16] and stuff is made from but you see he
[8:18] was charging for this
[8:20] what it means he was charging his
[8:22] subjects for the kind of the hope of
[8:24] life that he was sending out to them
[8:27] just give them a glimmer of hope well
[8:29] maybe you might make it if you get up in
[8:31] front of the church and confess all your
[8:32] wrongs and and make sure that you just
[8:34] do everything just right that's nonsense
[8:38] most things there are some things need
[8:40] to be confessed in front of the church
[8:41] but most things you need to confess to
[8:43] God and then you need to come and
[8:45] worship you need to come to the house of
[8:46] God and get some freedom in your heart
[8:48] and in your soul and begin to worship
[8:50] God
[8:51] right
[8:53] that's good hey we should never judge
[8:56] anyone for worshiping come on
[8:59] I don't care what they've been through
[9:00] what they've done where they've been
[9:02] what their prior life has been we should
[9:04] never judge someone for giving praise to
[9:06] the King of Kings
[9:09] hope you're hearing me this morning we
[9:11] shouldn't look down on people for
[9:13] worshiping and say Well they're not
[9:15] worthy of worshiping neither are you
[9:16] neither am I but we're here anyway we
[9:19] might as well worship if he came we
[9:21] might as well worship
[9:26] sir
[9:27] but he was charging for the spiritual
[9:30] life of the church oh God people still
[9:32] do it today
[9:34] he said he started in at that very time
[9:36] making them pay for prayers
[9:38] charging for prayer he said they still
[9:41] do it no Venus
[9:43] now oil types of spirit
[9:46] wine types of stimulation of Revelation
[9:49] how many know that brother Brandon
[9:50] taught us that in the third seal
[9:52] now when the truth of a promised word of
[9:56] God has been truly revealed to his
[9:58] Saints that's filled with oil
[10:01] they all get stimulated yeah
[10:04] brother Brown said wine is a stimulation
[10:07] yeah
[10:08] he said Glory I feel it right now
[10:10] stimulated with joy
[10:13] shouts yeah
[10:15] got some of that new wine yeah
[10:19] when it does it has the same effect upon
[10:21] them that wine does upon a natural man
[10:24] because when the Revelation has been
[10:27] given of a truth of God and the True
[10:29] Believer filled with oil and the
[10:31] Revelation is revealed the stimulation
[10:33] becomes so great that he makes him
[10:35] behave himself unnormally
[10:39] I like that yeah
[10:41] yeah we might as well just let her hair
[10:42] down there ain't no reason to be nervous
[10:44] in church
[10:46] there's no reason to feel condemnation
[10:48] there's no reason to go through and I'm
[10:49] going to deal with that a little bit
[10:50] tonight but there's no reason to just
[10:52] just walk around with your head suck it
[10:54] and throw it out to the ground say well
[10:56] I better pay Penance for all I've done
[10:57] that's not how we're saved we're not
[11:00] saved by doing enough good works to
[11:02] overcome our bad words we're not saved
[11:04] because the balances are balanced out
[11:05] it'll never be balanced out what he did
[11:08] for us is way much greater than anything
[11:10] we could ever do for him but we serve
[11:13] him because we love him we dress this
[11:15] way because we love him we shout because
[11:17] we love him we worship because we love
[11:19] him
[11:20] right and that's what was wrong with
[11:22] Pentecost even their Worship in shouting
[11:24] and praising became a transaction yeah
[11:27] it's like if you do this you're going to
[11:29] be all right no it doesn't matter I
[11:30] could not shout another day in my life
[11:32] and still be born again and still be
[11:34] saved but I shout because I am saved
[11:37] worship because I am saved
[11:41] a transactional
[11:43] we shouldn't teach our young people that
[11:45] they have to have a transaction in order
[11:48] to be saved no you're saved by the blood
[11:50] of Jesus Christ
[11:54] and you believe that and when you do it
[11:56] changes your life
[11:58] now watch
[12:01] this is what happened at Pentecost
[12:04] he's got to hold some of that new wine
[12:07] God
[12:08] oh my god Jehovah God
[12:11] poured himself into Christ
[12:14] all of God Jesus the Bible says is the
[12:17] fullness of the godhead bodily all that
[12:19] God was he poured into Christ
[12:22] bottled him up
[12:24] right the God man
[12:26] walked on Earth lived died
[12:29] he died the man died
[12:32] and it's it's it's it's Spirit he went
[12:35] and preached to the souls in hell for
[12:37] for three days and then he comes back up
[12:41] and when he raises up from the dead he
[12:44] sits down as it were at the right hand
[12:46] of God at the right hand of authority of
[12:48] power
[12:49] and and then he comes 50 days later you
[12:53] remember Andy after the Ascension after
[12:56] the 40 days he comes back then after 10
[12:58] days to uh the disciples who are waiting
[13:01] in the upper room
[13:03] right and what was happening was God was
[13:05] uniting himself with man
[13:08] he was pouring himself into his body
[13:13] it was a marriage
[13:15] right he was identifying himself he
[13:19] would be Mr Jesus and she would be Mrs
[13:22] Jesus
[13:24] right he was identifying himself with
[13:27] the church
[13:29] and when he did something happened
[13:33] listen listen to me
[13:36] what they did
[13:38] was not the Holy Ghost itself like
[13:40] speaking in tongues and languages where
[13:43] the people could understand staggering
[13:44] like drunk men that was not the holy
[13:46] ghost that was the effects of the Holy
[13:47] Ghost
[13:48] but there was wine at the wedding
[13:53] yes are you with me now
[13:54] the wedding was the important thing and
[13:56] some people you know many times we begin
[13:58] to think I'm just preaching to you this
[13:59] morning but we think well you know I I
[14:01] know the word I understand the message
[14:03] that's enough I I have a an ability to
[14:07] comprehend the Mysteries that are in the
[14:08] book and I understand these things
[14:10] that's good that's wonderful God give
[14:12] you that by Revelation but there needs
[14:14] to be wine at the wedding
[14:16] in order to make it to the hardships of
[14:18] life you need some stimulants you need
[14:21] something in your life that's going to
[14:22] keep you alive something that's going to
[14:24] move you something I don't mean that
[14:25] you'll be shouting running and jumping
[14:27] all the time I mean something that'll
[14:29] make you happy when you shouldn't be
[14:30] happy something that'll give you peace
[14:32] that passes understanding something
[14:34] that'll make you right and live right
[14:36] and look right in the world that you
[14:38] live in is so full of darkness and wrong
[14:42] huh
[14:43] this is what happened at Pentecost they
[14:45] were they were United with Christ
[14:48] and when they did the Bible says they
[14:50] were all amazed we're in doubt saying
[14:52] one to another what means this that's
[14:53] the ones that we're watching this take
[14:55] place so we're hearing it
[14:57] and others mocking said these men are
[15:00] full of new wine
[15:03] which is the same type of wine that
[15:07] Jesus provided at the wedding yeah
[15:09] these men are full of new wine
[15:14] but Peter's standing up with the love
[15:15] because new wine is at its strongest
[15:19] this is why we have to have many
[15:20] refillings of the Holy Spirit right
[15:23] right this is why we need to have
[15:24] Revelation stimulation of revelation we
[15:27] need to we need to dig into the message
[15:28] we need to search out the things of God
[15:30] you need new wine
[15:32] you can't always say well I like that
[15:34] age stuff and stuff I got 30 years ago
[15:36] that's good but ain't got as much
[15:38] stimulant in it
[15:40] right but the new ones got new stimulant
[15:42] in it that's why sometimes you go
[15:44] through some things you say well I was
[15:45] healed 20 years ago I know God's A
[15:47] Healer but you get sick again why
[15:49] because there needs to be some new wine
[15:50] in your life so God's going to bring uh
[15:53] allow a sickness to come upon you so
[15:55] that so that he can heal you so you can
[15:58] have a new stimulant
[16:00] are you hearing me this morning
[16:02] he does that for us he cares about us
[16:05] so Peter stood up and said men and
[16:07] Brethren hearken into my words he said
[16:09] these all you that dwell the Jerusalem
[16:11] hearken of my words he said these are
[16:13] not drunk
[16:14] as you suppose seeing it was about the
[16:16] third hour of the day
[16:18] the bars aren't even open yet
[16:21] he said but this is that which was
[16:23] spoken by the prophet Joel
[16:26] I love that he had to use that he had to
[16:27] convince them these it can't be drunk
[16:29] there's nothing open
[16:30] selling liquor
[16:32] they act drunk
[16:34] but they can't be drunk because there's
[16:36] nothing open Sound liquor but he said
[16:37] this is that yeah which was spoken by
[16:40] the prophet Joel
[16:42] it had to be scriptural I watched and it
[16:45] fulfilled the scripture until it also
[16:47] fulfilled the scripture in Isaiah Isaiah
[16:49] 28 9 it says Whom Shall he teach
[16:51] knowledge Whom Shall he make to
[16:52] understand Doctrine them that are weaned
[16:54] from the milk and are drawn from the
[16:55] breast for a precept must be upon
[16:57] precept precept upon precept line upon
[16:59] line upon line here a little there
[17:01] little for what's tampering lips and
[17:03] another tongue will he speak to this
[17:05] people
[17:06] to whom he said this is the rest
[17:09] wherewith you may cause the weary to
[17:11] rest
[17:12] and
[17:13] when the wine runs out in the middle of
[17:16] the wedding
[17:17] when it gets really hard to serve and it
[17:20] gets really hard to fulfill your
[17:22] obligation and if it gets really hard to
[17:24] do your duties at the church
[17:27] this is the refreshing yes
[17:29] oh don't you need a refreshing from time
[17:31] to time
[17:32] this is the refreshing
[17:34] said yet they would not hear speaking of
[17:36] that Jewish Nation they would not hear
[17:39] notice brother Brandon said this is the
[17:42] wine that's poured out what is wine in
[17:44] the Bible refreshments
[17:46] Refreshments this is the refreshment
[17:49] that comes from the presence of the Lord
[17:51] you can have all your all the old stuff
[17:54] that you want to you can have all this
[17:56] stuff for the world all the the sports
[17:57] and I'm not preaching against Sports I'm
[18:00] not preaching against those things but
[18:01] you can have all of it give me that new
[18:02] wine that lets me come to the house of
[18:04] God and lets me Worship in a way that I
[18:07] know that God is pleased and I know that
[18:09] I've made him happy late give me that
[18:11] new wine that lets me hear a sermon that
[18:14] I'll get Revelation from that lets me or
[18:16] open a book or listen to a tape I get
[18:19] Revelation from it
[18:20] and I get stimulated new wine
[18:24] are you with me this morning
[18:26] so when the Holy Ghost fell and they
[18:28] seen the fire of God fall upon their
[18:29] mind that began to stimulate them
[18:33] oh my
[18:35] first thing you know
[18:36] they got so stimulated so that people
[18:38] actually thought they were drunk but
[18:41] they were stimulated by the Revelation
[18:43] God's Vindicated Revelation made plain
[18:46] to them they was happy about it God
[18:49] promised it here it was revealed to them
[18:51] and Vindicated to them here was a man
[18:53] standing there saying this is it this is
[18:55] that this is it and there it was being a
[18:57] Vindicator by the same sign he said that
[18:59] we have today
[19:02] Hallelujah
[19:03] he said oh how wonderful revealed
[19:05] revealed they become so stimulated when
[19:07] they seen The Vindicator that just
[19:08] always does that it always does
[19:12] maybe we need to get our heads off out
[19:13] of out of Fox News and out of CNN and
[19:16] get them back into scripture where we
[19:18] can get some stimulation of Revelation
[19:19] get it back in the house of God and get
[19:22] some stimulation of Revelation find out
[19:24] that everybody's not against you
[19:25] everybody don't hate you there's a power
[19:28] and a purpose of God
[19:33] you can you can have stimulation of
[19:34] Revelation in your life
[19:42] I get stimulated when I eat
[19:46] remember the bill
[19:48] I get stimulated I ate them ribs man I
[19:50] get stimulated
[19:52] I go to a really good restaurant I'm in
[19:54] a really good restaurant I get
[19:55] stimulated as soon as that my wife will
[19:57] tell you I start making no oh that was
[19:59] good man
[20:03] that excites me
[20:08] you all know that so some of y'all get
[20:10] stimulated about things maybe it's not
[20:11] food maybe it's a new car or an old car
[20:14] that stimulates you
[20:16] huh something something that stimulates
[20:18] your sports whatever it is it is when's
[20:21] the last time
[20:23] you opened up the book yeah and you
[20:26] begin to read and you read about a
[20:28] wedding in Cana and you and that wine
[20:30] began to stimulate you
[20:34] realize how much God does for us and
[20:36] sometimes I just love being able to
[20:37] stand up here and preach to you because
[20:39] it what it does for me is I'm standing
[20:41] up here and we were preaching the other
[20:43] day and preaching about the about the
[20:45] crystal the sea of glass I didn't hardly
[20:46] have any voice to preach it with but the
[20:48] crystal the crystal sea that was there
[20:50] before them it was completely clear
[20:52] brother said it meant they had nothing
[20:54] against them they were completely
[20:55] redeemed what that did for my heart was
[20:57] the stimulation of Revelation is
[20:59] something inside of you that moves you
[21:01] yes man that's good and we could go and
[21:05] look at the message of the hour and look
[21:07] at what we have and look out of
[21:09] denominationalism and and I'll be honest
[21:11] with you I'm glad that we got a prophet
[21:13] I'm glad we have a prophet
[21:16] I was looking just the other day that
[21:18] they actually preached a sermon on an
[21:20] Evangelical conference and it was it was
[21:22] a oh it was AI it was artificial
[21:25] intelligence that preached a sermon in
[21:28] Germany and it preached a good
[21:30] denominational sermon
[21:33] it did in fact there's been a lot of
[21:36] preachers speculate could it take our
[21:37] place
[21:41] and it probably will
[21:44] because they can get a self-help seminar
[21:47] an algorithm can preach what they're
[21:49] preaching
[21:52] hope you realize where we're at this
[21:54] morning
[21:55] algorithm a computer can preach what
[21:58] they're preaching but a computer cannot
[22:00] preach to you this message
[22:04] God didn't call mechanical devices to
[22:06] preach the gospel he called men amen a
[22:09] computer can't preach this message a
[22:11] computer cannot get stimulated by
[22:13] revelation
[22:15] right hold on over to God it can
[22:18] probably preach about this message it
[22:19] can probably preach a Methodist message
[22:21] but it cannot preach the word of God it
[22:24] cannot go get the hidden man and bring
[22:26] it out
[22:29] yes sir
[22:32] oh my
[22:34] god brother Branham said
[22:36] he said when I see that God promised to
[22:38] do a certain thing in this day when he
[22:41] promised to break off these seals this
[22:42] last day you don't know the joy the
[22:44] glory when I've seen him reveal this
[22:46] stand there and watch it happen
[22:48] and know that I'll take any person to
[22:50] charge he never did say one thing to us
[22:52] but what happened that way
[22:53] and then to see the joy that's in my
[22:55] heart it wasn't cold and dead and formal
[22:58] but it when the seals come it didn't
[23:00] come in a clinical way but it come in a
[23:03] way that brought joy to his heart what
[23:05] is your Revelation done for you let me
[23:07] ask you that
[23:08] what has it done for your family what
[23:10] has it done for those around you what
[23:12] has it done for the church that you go
[23:13] to what is it done for the people around
[23:15] you if it's a revelation from God it
[23:18] don't come in a dry desert dry bear in
[23:20] place but it comes with stimulation of
[23:22] Revelation that gives you the ability to
[23:24] do more than what you were able to do
[23:27] Hallelujah
[23:29] he said he said you know that I'll take
[23:31] any person to charge he never did say
[23:32] one thing to us but what happened that
[23:34] way and then to see the joy that's in my
[23:36] heart when I see his promise for this
[23:37] last stage as he promised to do it here
[23:39] I've seen it Vindicated me perfectly
[23:40] right you hear me say I feel religious
[23:43] he said that's what's the matter the
[23:45] stimulation is so bad I just about ready
[23:47] to go cutting up you know stimulation
[23:49] from Revelation said they become so
[23:51] stimulated over the Revelation
[23:53] you've got to catch this they become so
[23:56] stimulated over the Revelation that they
[23:58] Vindicated the promise
[24:01] so the wine was not just to make them
[24:03] feel good although it had that effect
[24:05] yeah
[24:07] right but it had a purpose brother
[24:09] Harold it had a purpose
[24:13] the wine had a purpose wine they say it
[24:16] has a medicinal value
[24:18] a medicinal value and this wine has a
[24:21] medicinal purpose they've indicated the
[24:23] promise what did it do the actually the
[24:26] stimulation made them with stammering
[24:29] lips
[24:30] and staggering like drunk men yeah
[24:33] God let me say this without the
[24:36] stimulation of Revelation you can't
[24:38] fulfill the word of the hour
[24:40] without the stimulation of Revelation
[24:42] they could not have fulfilled Isaiah 28
[24:44] yeah they could not have done it oh god
[24:47] without the joy without the stimulation
[24:49] listen you say why can't I have it
[24:51] without the joy why can't I just have it
[24:53] as a clinical experience why can't it
[24:55] just be a teaching because it takes the
[24:57] wine of the Holy Ghost to actually make
[24:59] you fulfill the word
[25:01] he said they become so stimulated that
[25:03] they Vindicated the promise
[25:05] Hallelujah that we'd be that stimulated
[25:08] today since they broke out the joy of
[25:10] stimulation until the people said
[25:12] they're drunk on new line when God
[25:14] revealed his promise to them and not
[25:15] only did he reveal it but he proved it
[25:18] how did he prove it through a bunch of
[25:20] seemingly drunk people
[25:23] Hallelujah
[25:27] John 2 and 4 Y'all Gonna think I'm crazy
[25:28] for I'm done so it's all right
[25:32] Jesus says in her woman
[25:35] what have I do with thee
[25:37] my hour is not yet come
[25:40] this isn't my wedding
[25:43] oh God
[25:45] but if he would provide wine
[25:48] for a wedding in Galilee we don't even
[25:51] know who the wedding was for don't you
[25:53] think he'll have wine at his wedding
[25:56] which is going on right now
[25:59] Hallelujah
[26:01] see the wedding could have went on just
[26:03] as well with a bunch of dry thirsty
[26:06] people
[26:07] but the word he was the word
[26:10] and he would not allow the wedding to go
[26:13] on that way
[26:16] yeah
[26:17] I see people say well I like the way it
[26:19] was 40 years ago and we all just sat
[26:20] around the tape and I'm sure there were
[26:22] there were dedicated people that loved
[26:24] the Lord many of you were there during
[26:26] that time everybody just sit there real
[26:27] quiet and things that's wonderful but at
[26:29] the wedding sometime during the wedding
[26:31] when the wine runs out there's got to be
[26:33] some wine there's got to be some
[26:35] enjoyment there's got to be some some
[26:37] satisfaction there's got to be some
[26:38] there's got to be some promises that are
[26:40] preached and there's got to be some
[26:42] people who believe them sometime during
[26:44] the wedding there's got to be simulation
[26:45] of Revelation
[26:48] he could have come and just taken a
[26:50] bunch of dry thirsty people and revealed
[26:52] the bride and went home
[26:53] but he waits until the people
[26:55] get the new wine
[26:58] Hallelujah the word would not allow the
[27:01] wedding to continue like it was
[27:04] and notice brother Reynolds says when
[27:06] his presence is near it certainly brings
[27:09] emotion
[27:10] he said anything without emotion is dead
[27:12] any religion hasn't got some emotion to
[27:13] it you better bury it instead it brings
[27:15] emotion he quickens us
[27:17] when we are quick and let's remember
[27:18] what quickened US
[27:20] right so there's a purpose it's not just
[27:23] just a bunch of people acting like drunk
[27:24] people because you could act like that
[27:25] on your own yeah
[27:28] yeah right but that's not what it is
[27:30] but it's actually something that is
[27:32] vindicating that it's vindicating the
[27:34] word
[27:35] he said let's remember what quickness
[27:36] what did is the presence of the Holy
[27:38] Spirit Jesus Christ in our midst showing
[27:40] himself that he is alive
[27:44] brother Branham taught us that the angel
[27:46] of the Lord accompanies the message
[27:50] I love that he didn't say it accompanies
[27:53] the messenger always but it accompanies
[27:56] the message always
[27:58] the message always so when we preach the
[28:00] message brother Joel brother Stewart
[28:02] when we preach the message the angel of
[28:04] the Lord accompanies our message we need
[28:06] to believe that
[28:08] it accompanies our message because it's
[28:11] not our message it's the message that
[28:13] came from the mighty angel
[28:15] so the company's the message always
[28:18] and brother random goes in another place
[28:20] he said oh the greatest place where I
[28:21] know of is to pray until I can realize
[28:23] I'm in the presence of God and recognize
[28:26] it he said I think that ought to be the
[28:27] thrill of the church it's the presence
[28:29] of the Holy Spirit seeing the god that
[28:32] made the promise standing among us feel
[28:34] his presence and see his word and see it
[28:37] Vindicated you know to give Faith to
[28:38] make cripples walk and blind sea and
[28:40] death here and dumb speak
[28:43] that's good yes right
[28:47] now I want you to watch John 2 and 5.
[28:50] so his mother
[28:52] see Jesus doesn't do it on his own
[28:55] look his mother said to the servants
[28:59] whatever he says unto you do it
[29:02] I like that
[29:03] whatever he says unto you do it
[29:06] and so there had to be somebody there
[29:08] that was responsible to carry the wine
[29:13] now they could not they could fill the
[29:15] pot with water
[29:17] and they could bring the people together
[29:19] we might say in this hour but they could
[29:22] not turn the water into wine
[29:26] the word Christ had to be there
[29:29] to bring the stimulation of Revelation
[29:32] but there was somebody oh my there was a
[29:35] servant there God help me to be one
[29:38] today a servant that will carry the
[29:41] stimulation of Revelation see this this
[29:43] message is not to be preached as some
[29:46] kind of a a some kind of a a lesson
[29:50] brought by some kind of a professor
[29:52] somewhere that's not what it's supposed
[29:53] to be preached at but it's remember the
[29:55] ark was to be carried over their
[29:57] shoulders over their hearts
[30:00] the message is supposed to be on our
[30:02] hearts
[30:03] and the stimulation of Revelation the
[30:05] way this works is that actually we carry
[30:09] the stimulation now we don't have big
[30:11] Stone vessels or little bitty cups to
[30:13] carry the wine in him we don't have
[30:15] little little wine cups carrying them
[30:17] out here while we're I'm not walking
[30:18] around mother Joel with a cup of wine
[30:20] and giving you a drink and giving them a
[30:21] drink that's not my job what I'm doing
[30:23] is I'm carrying the stimulation of
[30:25] Revelation in my own heart if I don't
[30:28] have it I can't give it to you
[30:31] but the servant had it so he could give
[30:33] it to the people at the wedding
[30:36] [Applause]
[30:39] amen this time we got excited about the
[30:41] message of the hour again
[30:43] it's time we it's time we took a step
[30:45] back and realized what what we're a part
[30:47] of yeah we're part of the greatest thing
[30:49] that's happened since the beginning
[30:51] we're part of the restoration we're part
[30:53] of the going home time we're sitting on
[30:55] the train it's already left the station
[30:57] we're going home we know who we are we
[31:00] ought to be excited about that
[31:01] ought to be some stimulation of that
[31:03] revelation
[31:06] sometimes
[31:07] I'm sorry church I I don't want to be
[31:11] harsh this morning but sometimes we
[31:12] stand here and say
[31:14] I'm elected
[31:15] I know that I am
[31:21] well
[31:23] you ever seen a victory party
[31:26] when I'm talking about the ones when
[31:28] they hit when they get elected
[31:30] they I think they turn that camera off
[31:32] after a while
[31:33] because it gets kind of crazy
[31:35] because when the president gets elected
[31:37] to be president or the congressman gets
[31:39] elected to be Congressman you know what
[31:41] they do they throw a party
[31:43] and the balloons fall and everything
[31:45] goes on why they are elected yeah come
[31:48] on
[31:50] some of y'all get it after a while
[31:52] they've been elected so I've been
[31:55] elected if you really get a revelation
[31:56] of that if you've really read the
[31:58] returns that you begin to realize I'm
[32:00] the elected of God I belong to God it'll
[32:02] bring a smile to your face at the very
[32:04] least it'll do something to your heart
[32:05] I'm elected I belong to God
[32:09] They carried it on their hearts
[32:12] oh my
[32:13] God oh my Paul says Our Gospel came not
[32:16] unto you in word only
[32:18] but also in power and in the Holy Ghost
[32:21] with stimulation of Revelation and much
[32:24] Assurance as you knew what men or men we
[32:26] were among you for your sake we became
[32:28] the evidence that the wine was good
[32:35] today that most of the people don't want
[32:37] a man that'll stand and tell the truth
[32:39] about it they want some little Ricky
[32:40] with a Hollywood haircut perfume all
[32:42] over walk right up here and talk about
[32:43] some theology that he learned off in
[32:45] some Cemetery or seminary he said excuse
[32:47] me it's all the same place a home of
[32:49] corpses
[32:51] so then we find that everywhere they
[32:53] want something like that they don't want
[32:54] the old-fashioned gospel handed out in
[32:57] the power and demonstration of the Holy
[32:58] Ghost anymore hand it out that's our job
[33:01] to hand it out we didn't make it we
[33:03] can't create it I didn't give myself the
[33:05] inspiration I didn't bring the message
[33:06] to the hour but I can hand it out that's
[33:09] my job is to hand it out and if I
[33:11] believe in what I'm handing out you'll
[33:13] know it yeah
[33:15] okay
[33:16] that's good
[33:20] Hallelujah
[33:24] remember we need a testimony meeting
[33:27] a great thing you said well
[33:29] well I'm not I'm not a preacher we need
[33:32] a testimony meeting
[33:33] we need a prayer meeting
[33:35] when you're digging down tearing up
[33:37] we need Christ back in our midst and
[33:39] know the Bible
[33:40] he said we're just drifting looser and
[33:42] looser all the time we need to come back
[33:43] to the original Foundation come back to
[33:45] the place of the rock that we were hewed
[33:47] from start over again
[33:49] it's time to get that new wine
[33:53] it is listen it is a responsibility of
[33:56] the ministry to carry the stimulation of
[33:58] the revelation of the word not in their
[34:00] arms but in their hearts
[34:03] again you say well I'm not a preacher
[34:05] but you're still carrying the gospel
[34:07] but the brand said what the church is
[34:09] slacking today is testifying of our
[34:10] great powerful Jesus today we try to
[34:13] limit him try to say well he was and
[34:15] back Yonder but today he's the same that
[34:17] he was then and the church who's got a
[34:19] vision of this
[34:21] do we have a vision of it today and
[34:23] knows it ought not to be slack at any
[34:26] time
[34:27] I mean did you hear that
[34:30] ought not to be slack at any time when
[34:32] the church goes slack when they don't
[34:34] care what the building looks like and
[34:35] they don't care whether they come to
[34:36] church or not and they don't care what
[34:38] the music is like and they don't care
[34:39] about nothing you say well people
[34:41] complain sometimes I really haven't
[34:42] complained and not care yeah I don't
[34:45] want them to complain but I'd rather
[34:46] have them complain than not care yeah
[34:49] all right the whole thing works I've
[34:51] said that before in a marriage the only
[34:52] thing worse than fighting is apathy
[34:55] or you just don't care no more the
[34:58] church has got a vision amen of a great
[35:01] powerful Jesus Oh My of a message of the
[35:04] hour that's alive amen the church has
[35:07] got a vision of this ought not be slack
[35:09] at any time but telling everywhere they
[35:12] go Jesus lives and Reigns
[35:15] Hallelujah we ought to do the very best
[35:17] we can for the gospel if we have an
[35:19] ability to buy a better microphone to
[35:21] help the gospel we ought to do it if we
[35:23] have the ability to preach with all of
[35:25] our heart and give it our all we ought
[35:27] to do it if we've got the ability to
[35:29] witness to our neighbor we ought to do
[35:30] it if we've got the ability to come to
[35:33] the house of God even if feel like it
[35:35] but sometimes you're just there to help
[35:37] somebody else we ought to do it why
[35:39] because we are not to slack when it
[35:41] comes to testifying of who Jesus is
[35:44] Hallelujah we have to help sometimes
[35:48] we gotta help
[35:49] but the brand talked about the shunami
[35:51] woman how she helped Elisha
[35:53] she helped Elijah she gave him a room
[35:55] he could stay in
[35:57] and it helped her
[35:59] because she wasn't able to have children
[36:01] and she had one and then the child died
[36:04] and it was raised from the dead
[36:06] brother better said that that was a
[36:08] prophet's reward was to be friends with
[36:09] a prophet because she was a help she had
[36:12] a Ministry of Health she couldn't stand
[36:14] on the pulpit and preach she couldn't be
[36:16] but she had a Ministry of Health I thank
[36:18] God for some of you you have a Ministry
[36:20] of helps
[36:22] and again that's enough if that's all
[36:24] your ministry ever is that's enough
[36:26] that's more important maybe than many
[36:27] other Ministries
[36:30] and if there's anything brother said he
[36:32] talks about that shooting my woman he
[36:34] said if there's anything we ought to be
[36:35] it's kind to one another
[36:38] when you see a brother or sister in
[36:40] fault don't never breathe it to nobody
[36:43] help us Lord
[36:46] let me turn around and repent I'll get
[36:48] back to you
[36:51] isn't that good yeah
[36:54] yeah don't ever breathe it to nobody
[36:56] oh my that's the next one
[37:00] next quote he said if there's anything
[37:03] keep it to yourself and pray for that
[37:06] person
[37:07] be kind to them
[37:09] and if the spirit of God is in you
[37:12] then you will be kind to one another
[37:15] Jesus said I come to do thy will
[37:18] father
[37:20] oh God help me today
[37:22] God help all of us
[37:24] you know why sometimes we're not kind
[37:26] because we have a sticky nature
[37:29] it's sticky for a reason just what it is
[37:31] but God help me to be kind
[37:34] help me to be kind yeah
[37:36] yeah now listen
[37:37] let me let me be kind in helping others
[37:40] and then let me be kind to the person
[37:43] who's not kind
[37:46] that's what Jesus did
[37:48] now look
[37:50] he said you'll if that spiritually you
[37:52] have that same attitude towards people
[37:53] he said we're about to master his
[37:55] business as he was about the father's
[37:56] business and the same spirit that he had
[37:58] to begin the works of the father and to
[38:00] finish the atonement to make a way that
[38:02] we could carry the message that we
[38:05] could carry the message
[38:07] listen Jesus wasn't just in it for
[38:10] himself but he made an atonement he said
[38:13] that he was he was diligent The Same
[38:15] Spirit that he had in him to begin the
[38:18] works of the father and to finish the
[38:20] atonement to make a way that we could
[38:22] carry the message if that spirit's in
[38:24] you you'll have that same attitude
[38:26] towards people
[38:28] trying to do what you can to help them
[38:30] no matter who they are
[38:35] yes right
[38:38] even if they are message people
[38:42] sometimes I hate to say it sometimes
[38:44] we're kinder to Outsiders when we are to
[38:46] message people
[38:48] well it got quiet didn't it we should be
[38:52] kinder to outside we should be kind to
[38:53] Outsiders they should know but
[38:55] especially Paul says to those of the
[38:57] household of faith yeah
[39:01] he said you'll have that same attitude
[39:02] towards people trying to do what you can
[39:04] to help them no matter who they are
[39:06] where they are you'll try to help people
[39:08] amenities that's kind of strong but
[39:10] that's the truth
[39:11] we'll move on
[39:13] what were they they were carrying
[39:15] the wine
[39:16] the new wine
[39:18] oh my and there were set there six water
[39:21] pots of stone after the manner of the
[39:23] purifying of the Jews contained two or
[39:25] three Firkins or the measures a piece
[39:27] two or three measures is about 120 to
[39:30] 180 gallons would be the total of all
[39:32] all six jars 120 to 180 gallons of water
[39:35] that's quite a bit quite a bit of water
[39:38] if you've ever carried water in stone
[39:40] jars
[39:42] and the the jars were actually made out
[39:44] of a single piece of stone because they
[39:46] were purification jars for the purpose
[39:48] of ritual purification it had to be made
[39:50] out of a single piece of stone and so
[39:52] all six of them together about 120 to
[39:54] 180 gallons of water
[39:56] and Jesus said for them fill the water
[39:59] pots with water and they filled them up
[40:01] to the brim now you know sometimes we
[40:03] have to be willing to do the work so
[40:06] that the stimulation of Revelation can
[40:07] come
[40:09] right the servants had to be willing to
[40:11] go out there and take and mess with the
[40:13] water water represents people right
[40:16] right the servants had to be willing to
[40:17] go among the people and and pick up some
[40:19] people and carry them to church and put
[40:21] them down and go get some more and pick
[40:23] them up you see what I'm see where I'm
[40:25] going
[40:25] see they had to be willing to go out and
[40:28] mingle among the people they had to be
[40:29] willing to get the water and put it in
[40:31] there before it could become wine
[40:34] right they had to be willing and
[40:35] sometimes even in preaching what we're
[40:36] doing is we're laying a foundation we're
[40:38] laying a foundation you hit preachers
[40:39] say that what are you doing you're
[40:40] pouring that water in there pouring that
[40:42] water in there because we've got to be
[40:43] water for there can be wine yeah
[40:46] all right so there had to be water
[40:48] because he was going to change something
[40:49] I'm gonna get to that in a moment if I
[40:50] have time this morning but he took the
[40:52] water pops he filled him with water
[40:53] actually he didn't fill it with water
[40:55] the servants did
[40:57] they probably got sweaty
[41:00] they probably wish they'd put on more
[41:02] deodorant
[41:04] it was hot they thought it was useless
[41:09] can you imagine well we were told to do
[41:11] we're just doing what we're told but man
[41:13] it's a dead bunch of people I'm telling
[41:15] you what now
[41:17] y'all are not but you know what I'm
[41:18] saying so the servant stinks sometimes
[41:21] we might as well go over where the
[41:22] Wine's already operating you don't want
[41:24] to go work where the Wine's already
[41:25] there you want to go to a place where
[41:27] you need it
[41:29] right go to a place where the wine where
[41:31] the wine is going to be poured out it's
[41:33] not all about us
[41:34] that's right go to a place where you can
[41:36] dump in some water yeah
[41:38] yeah so the song leader comes and dumps
[41:40] his water in there and the preacher
[41:41] comes and dumps his water in there reads
[41:42] the scriptures and reads the quotes and
[41:45] that's all they can do but only Jesus
[41:46] can turn the water into wine
[41:51] Jesus said fill the water pots with
[41:53] water I loved how they followed his
[41:55] instructions exactly
[41:56] they filled them up to the brim yeah
[41:59] well nobody gonna slip in and mix the
[42:01] water with wine
[42:03] or the wine with the water
[42:06] now what was he going to do with all
[42:07] that water
[42:09] well the brother said what's he going to
[42:10] do with the church listen
[42:12] remember said I'm glad I got faith in
[42:14] him tonight that someday when my life my
[42:16] body within 16 elements would be back in
[42:18] the dust of the earth he will say
[42:20] William Branham and I'll come forth he
[42:22] will breed the breath of life into it
[42:24] and say there you are he will bypass the
[42:25] birth through my mother and so forth he
[42:27] said like Jesus on his first miracle he
[42:29] turned water into wine he said
[42:31] eventually it would have been wine but
[42:33] he bypassed all that procedure and said
[42:35] turn the water to wine
[42:37] at the resurrection he will not say Mr
[42:38] Mrs Branham get married again bring
[42:40] forth William he will speak and I'll
[42:42] come forth
[42:43] Hallelujah by the spoken word he
[42:46] bypassed the process of the fermentation
[42:48] of the water that's the age we live in
[42:50] church
[42:51] we're at the wedding he's turning the
[42:53] water into wine
[42:55] hey man he said did you notice when he
[42:57] went to make water into wine he took
[42:59] water first already created substance
[43:00] turned into wine I want you to watch he
[43:02] said verily verily I say unto you he
[43:04] that believeth on me the works that I do
[43:05] so he do also brother Joel hit on this I
[43:07] think last Sunday night he said Greater
[43:09] Works for these shall he do because I go
[43:10] to my father for Years brother said that
[43:12] was more but then he gives us another
[43:13] explanation of it and the message Shalom
[43:15] towards the end of his ministry he said
[43:17] the Greater Works if you look at it if
[43:19] you look at it in the original greater
[43:20] is actually greater yeah
[43:22] and brother Adam says greater he said
[43:25] was actually that he took something that
[43:27] he took out of nothing he created
[43:28] something yeah
[43:30] that's the third poll
[43:32] right he said did you notice when he
[43:34] went to make water into wine he took
[43:35] water first already created substance
[43:36] turn it into wine when he fed five
[43:38] thousand people he took a fish at one
[43:40] swam in the water broke it handed it out
[43:41] multiplied creation he took bread that
[43:43] was one sweet baked into bread broke it
[43:45] handed it after the people that were
[43:46] turned back again multiplied creation
[43:48] but in the last days when there was no
[43:50] sign of creation he speaks it into
[43:52] creation anyhow shows to be the same God
[43:55] don't give up on your family this is a
[43:57] time of the spoken word
[44:00] at all he can make water he can make
[44:03] wine when there is no water
[44:06] yeah right
[44:07] Hallelujah shows me the same God he was
[44:10] at the beginning he can create squirrels
[44:11] he can create whatever he wants to
[44:12] because he is God he said greater things
[44:14] that's what you do before I go to my
[44:15] father the word is infallible it has to
[44:17] be manifest has to be fulfilled greater
[44:19] than this so you do not multiplying but
[44:21] speaking out into creation
[44:24] listen there has to be a group that type
[44:26] Jesus type through the resurrection in
[44:28] fact he was one of those
[44:30] right God took that body and resurrected
[44:33] it yeah
[44:34] oh my but there's got to be a group
[44:39] that'll be changed
[44:40] in a moment in twinkling of an eye
[44:43] they're not just going to bypass the the
[44:46] birth again they're going to bypass
[44:48] death itself
[44:51] listen he said behold I show you a
[44:53] mystery we shall not all sleep but we
[44:54] shall all be changed in a moment in the
[44:56] twinkling of an eye at the last Trump
[44:58] the trumpet shall sound the dead should
[44:59] be raised Incorruptible and we shall be
[45:01] changed
[45:02] that's why he had to come in the end
[45:04] time with the third full ministry it was
[45:06] more than just a man yeah was God
[45:08] vindicating he was going to make
[45:09] something out of nothing
[45:12] yeah glory to God this message is spread
[45:15] all over the Earth without any
[45:16] headquarters yeah people tried to
[45:18] denominate and it wouldn't denominate
[45:19] yeah people tried to tried to push down
[45:22] on it won't push down people tried to
[45:24] say they're all backslid they're all
[45:25] going back to the church and they won't
[45:26] go back
[45:28] why won't we go back in spite of
[45:29] persecution because God took something
[45:31] that was nothing and made something out
[45:33] of it
[45:34] God did it we didn't do it God did it
[45:37] [Applause]
[45:42] he said to the
[45:44] said oh Jesus knows when it's time
[45:47] water got turned into wine
[45:50] Jesus told the
[45:52] Jesus told the servants he said it's
[45:55] time to close
[45:57] draw out now
[45:59] there is a time to close
[46:01] draw out now
[46:03] bear into the governor of the feast
[46:05] and they buried
[46:08] now you know I like to think that they
[46:10] didn't stop on the way
[46:12] wherever the governor of the feast was
[46:14] they just went straight to him other
[46:15] people might have tried to stop and talk
[46:16] to him oh can you go get me another
[46:18] piece of fish no I got a job to do
[46:21] Jesus told me that somehow this water
[46:25] that we poured into the vessels
[46:27] has become wine
[46:29] we're going to let the governor of the
[46:31] feast drink of it and see what he thinks
[46:34] they had a job and they did it
[46:36] and when the ruler of the feast had
[46:38] tasted the water that was made wine and
[46:39] knew not wince it was but the servants
[46:41] which through the water new amen
[46:44] the governor of the feast called The
[46:46] Bride group and saith on him every man
[46:48] at the beginning oh God
[46:51] they did have good wine at the beginning
[46:52] but in the middle it got to where there
[46:54] wasn't no wine at all
[46:56] it got worse and worse because what they
[46:58] would do is they would mix water with
[46:59] the wine to make it go longer and
[47:01] finally they had it so thin they just
[47:03] believed in Trinity and and and and all
[47:05] kinds of things
[47:07] it was so thin that they had all kinds
[47:08] of doctrines going on they had no move
[47:10] in the spirit they would and all that
[47:12] was gone it was the Dark Ages
[47:15] but God said I got a servant named
[47:17] Martin Luther yeah
[47:20] it'll take the water when I tell him to
[47:22] and he'll draw out a cup
[47:24] I'm gonna turn the water into wine yeah
[47:26] I got a servant named John Wesley I got
[47:28] a servant named William random
[47:31] word of God that's going to bring the
[47:32] best wine at the end of the wedding
[47:36] glory to God when we've been fully
[47:38] United to the word at the time of the
[47:40] appearing of the Bride
[47:42] oh God
[47:44] men of well drunk
[47:46] he said than that which is worse because
[47:48] maybe they won't taste as much yeah so
[47:51] but thou has kept the good wine
[47:53] until now
[47:55] most people
[47:57] would mix the wine with the best at the
[47:58] beginning and it was slowly die that's
[48:00] the nature of things but not Jesus he
[48:02] said I am the resurrection and the life
[48:07] the bride was about to be presented
[48:09] she'd been hidden down Through the Ages
[48:11] but now she was to be married now she is
[48:14] married and she's introduced to the
[48:16] world
[48:16] this is Mrs Jesus Christ
[48:20] I hope the church truly understands it
[48:22] what I mean you people I'm going to call
[48:24] you bride see that you'll understand it
[48:26] yes yes the bride has been introduced he
[48:28] said we're not living in a Pentecostal
[48:29] age we're living in another age we're
[48:31] not living in the method of stage we're
[48:33] living in another age we're living on up
[48:34] here to the bride age you're calling out
[48:36] of the church and getting it together
[48:37] for the Rapture that's the age that
[48:39] we're now living
[48:40] so if the bride age is here or the bride
[48:43] in time if we could say it that way the
[48:44] bride has to be here
[48:48] let that sink in for a minute you say
[48:50] well the bride failed not if the bride
[48:52] age is here come on right if the bright
[48:54] age is here there has to be a bride who
[48:56] would not be deceived
[48:57] if the bride age is here that infant
[49:00] private has to have become a mature
[49:01] bride
[49:03] when the bride agents here the bride has
[49:04] come out of her chamber and if that's
[49:07] the case listen to me there must be new
[49:09] wine at the wedding
[49:14] Revelation 19 7. listen what it says let
[49:17] us be glad and rejoice
