[39:26] you want to call
[39:28] I'm sure every one of us have faced it
[39:29] and if you haven't you're getting ready
[39:31] to so let's just read about it here for
[39:33] a minute we'll just go 15 verses on this
[39:36] one uh chapter 17 verse one and now the
[39:40] Philistines gathered together their
[39:42] armies to battle and were gathered
[39:44] together at shoka which belongeth to
[39:46] Judah and pitched between shoka and
[39:50] azika and and ephes deim and Saul and
[39:54] the men of Israel were gathered together
[39:56] and pitched by the valley of Ella or
[39:58] elaw and set the battle in Array against
[40:00] the Philistines and the Philistines
[40:02] stood on a mountain on the one side and
[40:04] Israel stood on a mountain on the other
[40:06] side and there was a valley between them
[40:09] and there went out a champion out of the
[40:11] camp of the Philistines named Goliath of
[40:14] gath whose height was six cubits and a
[40:17] span and he had a helmet of brass upon
[40:19] his head and he was armed with a coat of
[40:21] male and the weight of the coat was
[40:23] 5,000 shekels of brass and he had
[40:26] Greaves of brass upon his legs and
[40:27] target of brass between his shoulders
[40:29] and the staff of his spear was like a
[40:31] Weaver's beam and his Spear's head
[40:33] weighed 600 shekels of iron and one
[40:35] bearing a shield went before him and he
[40:37] stood and cried un the armies of Israel
[40:39] and said unto them why are you come out
[40:41] to set your battle in Array am not I a
[40:44] Philistine and you Servants of Saul
[40:47] choose you a man for you and let him
[40:49] come down to me and if he be able to
[40:51] fight with me and to kill me then will
[40:54] we be your servants but if I Prevail
[40:56] against him and kill him then you shall
[40:59] be our servants and serve us and the
[41:01] Philistines said I defy the armies of
[41:04] Israel this day give me a man that we
[41:07] may fight together when Saul and all of
[41:10] Israel heard those words of the
[41:11] Philistine they were Philistines they
[41:13] were dismayed and greatly afraid now
[41:15] David was the son of eph of Bethlehem
[41:19] Judah whose name was Jesse and he had
[41:21] eight sons and the man went among them
[41:24] for an old man in the days of Saul and
[41:26] the three eldest sons of Jess he went
[41:27] and followed Saul to the battle and the
[41:29] names of his three sons that went to
[41:31] battle were elab the firstborn and next
[41:34] unto him abinadab and the third sheema
[41:37] and David was the youngest and the three
[41:39] eldest followed Saul but David went and
[41:42] returned from Saul to feed his father's
[41:45] sheep at Bethlehem and may the Lord add
[41:48] His blessings you may be seated and so
[41:50] tonight I want you to notice that uh
[41:54] Saul uh Saul was a was a big man too we
[41:57] find find out that Saul was maybe 7 foot
[41:58] tall he was a big man but then Goliath
[42:01] comes in the camp or or is on the other
[42:03] side of the hill and we'll say there's a
[42:05] valley between them and so you've got
[42:07] the armies of the Lord on one side and
[42:09] you've got Goliath and this Army on the
[42:11] other side and you've got the go you got
[42:13] Goliath that is defying the armies of
[42:15] the Living God this is the armies these
[42:17] are the people these are the people that
[42:19] have been through some things they've
[42:20] seen all kinds of stuff happen they they
[42:23] they they know that God is on their side
[42:25] but they're scared because this giant
[42:28] excuse me so big and this giant is so so
[42:31] large and and and maybe he don't even
[42:34] know if they can take him and and and
[42:35] Saul is scared to death of him Saul
[42:38] doesn't know what to do he's a big man
[42:40] he's got the armor he's got he's got
[42:42] everything that the world would say you
[42:43] would have to have to to defeat this
[42:45] Goliath but but what he didn't have was
[42:48] courage and what he didn't have was what
[42:50] he didn't have was a calling on his life
[42:52] and and it wasn't his time to shine you
[42:54] might say and so Saul didn't know you
[42:57] know Saul didn't know what to do Saul
[42:58] just thought maybe maybe this would be a
[43:01] a time where we just have to just lay
[43:02] down and let him win maybe this is just
[43:04] too much maybe this Giant's just too big
[43:06] for us brother trip you know what it's
[43:08] like to be big and and so maybe it's
[43:10] just too maybe this Giant's too big to
[43:12] hit and uh but I say he's too big to
[43:14] miss tonight you know so what we need to
[43:17] do is quit looking at these giants like
[43:18] something we can't overcome and realize
[43:20] that every giant that is put in your way
[43:22] God has already went before you in
[43:24] battle and is already has already won
[43:27] the victory for you but he's there to
[43:29] test you but you see David had been
[43:31] tested before and David had already had
[43:33] to overcome a bear and a lion and and
[43:36] the same God that brought him through
[43:37] those Temptations and the same God that
[43:39] brought him through those battles would
[43:41] be the same God that would cause him to
[43:43] stand there in the face of a Goliath and
[43:46] and thank you buddy and Peter's new to
[43:48] this so he just forgot it's okay I do it
[43:50] on about every service anyway so what
[43:53] but what we find out is that that that
[43:55] that David was not scared because he had
[43:57] already witnessed the power of God
[43:59] before can somebody can young person say
[44:02] Amen to that so David was not scared
[44:05] David did not have fear because he had
[44:07] already seen what God could do now in
[44:09] this day I would say our young people
[44:11] have got it greater than any other
[44:12] generation in one sense that you have
[44:14] seen more in your day and know that God
[44:18] is real better today than they've known
[44:20] for thousands of years since he walked
[44:22] here in flesh himself you would not know
[44:24] that God is as real as he is right now
[44:26] because we've seen him we've seen him
[44:28] Vindicated we've seen God do things
[44:30] through a prophet of God and we we've
[44:31] seen these things there's no reason to
[44:33] be scared because if God through David
[44:36] could take out the bear and if God
[44:38] through David could take out the lion
[44:40] then God could come through a ruddy
[44:42] little boy named David and stand in the
[44:44] face of that Goliath and and defeat
[44:46] Goliath why because there was no fear in
[44:48] him so so what do we have today what do
[44:50] we fight today I would say it like this
[44:52] we we fight different things we fight
[44:54] depression and we fight fear and we
[44:56] fight complex and and we fight
[44:58] bitterness in our spirits and and many
[45:00] times there's peer pressure young people
[45:02] fight peer pressure you want to look
[45:03] like somebody else or you go to school
[45:05] and you want to fit in with the cool
[45:07] kids but that's just a Goliath in your
[45:09] way don't give in to that Goliath you
[45:11] were born for such a time as this to
[45:14] defeat that devil that's trying to take
[45:16] you out remember that the Goliath would
[45:18] like for you to surrender to him but we
[45:20] are not going to surrender to nor
[45:21] Goliath tonight but we are going to
[45:24] overcome why because we've seen what God
[45:26] has done and the god that has done
[45:28] something once will do it again can you
[45:30] say
[45:31] amen I believe that God is more than
[45:33] able in this day brother bandham talks
[45:35] about it like this and he says he says
[45:37] could you imagine a great Army on one
[45:39] side of the hill and a great Army on the
[45:41] other side of the hill and he said the
[45:43] armies on the opposite sides were
[45:44] Philistines versus Israel was so many
[45:46] more and they had the Challenger over
[45:48] there by the name of Goliath and he was
[45:50] many times bigger than any other man and
[45:52] he was making this Challenge and all of
[45:54] Israel with their training was scared of
[45:56] him and God chose a little Ruddy warty
[45:59] looking guy by the name of David with a
[46:01] little sheep skin coat on him and a
[46:03] slingshot packing in his hand to slay
[46:06] that giant and take over God uses simple
[46:09] things that seems ridiculous in the side
[46:12] of the world and he does that to show
[46:14] his great power can you say Amen so God
[46:17] didn't use Saul because he was big and
[46:19] mighty and had the he had all the armor
[46:22] on and he didn't use the whole Army no
[46:24] he used one man and I can say this
[46:26] afternoon if if we can get one young
[46:27] person on fire for God then I believe
[46:30] God can come down and start a Revival in
[46:33] our church if if we could just see one
[46:34] old person get on fire for God then I
[46:37] say we can see Revival in the pews again
[46:39] and if we can just get one person on
[46:41] fire for God there's not one giant that
[46:43] can stand in your way can you say
[46:46] Amen but David this is what brother Ben
[46:49] was trying to quote this morning and I
[46:50] wouldn't tell him because I didn't want
[46:51] him stealing my whole
[46:53] sermon but David had to fight Goliath
[46:56] before he could become a king but before
[46:59] he could ever fight Goliath he had to go
[47:00] through some trials he had to face a
[47:03] bear and he had to face a lion because
[47:06] in those instances he knew that God
[47:08] would then deliver him out of the hands
[47:09] of this Philistine that would try to
[47:11] defy the armies of the Living God see if
[47:13] he had done it before he could look back
[47:15] and say God's already been here before
[47:17] God's already done it once and if he did
[47:19] it one time he can do it again can you
[47:22] say Amen so I would say it like this and
[47:25] but but he had to be a shepherd He had
[47:26] to be a a simple man brother Brandon
[47:28] would preach a message called God hiding
[47:30] himself in Simplicity and I believe God
[47:32] is hiding himself in Simplicity again
[47:34] today we may not have the bigest
[47:36] churches and we may not have the
[47:38] fanciest uh fanciest dressed people in
[47:40] the church and maybe we don't have the
[47:41] greatest maybe the greatest things going
[47:43] on the greatest programs for our youth
[47:45] but I will say this that God is hidden
[47:47] in this little group of people here
[47:48] today God is hiding behind your skin
[47:51] here today God is veiling himself from
[47:53] the wise and prudent and he's revealing
[47:55] himself through for you young people
[47:58] here this afternoon sir but I want to
[48:01] just deal with a few things you're going
[48:02] to fight I want to deal with just a few
[48:03] things that you young people are going
[48:06] to deal with are you with me all right
[48:09] let me hear a big amen out of my young
[48:10] people amen all right well that was all
[48:13] right I heard Stuart my young person
[48:15] this afternoon all right so but here's
[48:17] something and brother brand deals with
[48:19] this and it might feel like we're
[48:20] getting off subject just for a minute
[48:21] but I want to deal with something here
[48:23] because here's something I see in the
[48:25] youth that I think we need to we need to
[48:26] pray about and we need to make sure that
[48:28] we don't let this get us down but
[48:29] depression and fear depression and fear
[48:33] depression gets on our young men
[48:35] depression gets on our young sisters and
[48:37] the next thing you know that the devil
[48:39] moves into that with that depression and
[48:41] he causes you to think things that are
[48:42] just unspeakable things and he makes you
[48:44] want to just give up and and you know
[48:47] whatever it is but we don't want to ever
[48:50] give in to the Goliath can you say Amen
[48:53] so brother brandom is is speaking on
[48:55] this tape and and turning the thoughts
[48:57] and he says depression fear I know what
[49:00] this uh the sister speaks to brother
[49:02] Brandon poor little thing she said she's
[49:04] never seen peace in her life he said
[49:07] sleep and and brother BR tries he says
[49:09] it's the same thing that I and he starts
[49:11] to deal with brother Brandon would deal
[49:12] with depression and stuff as well he
[49:14] said she can't sleep she's nervous
[49:16] there's tension and brother brandham
[49:18] prays like this he said dear God bear me
[49:20] record I've told the truth he's he's
[49:22] already preached the message he said how
[49:24] I feel for this little woman he said I
[49:26] pray God that you'll send to her tonight
[49:28] that streak of Faith from above that
[49:31] knows that you are obligated to your
[49:33] word now God is obligated to keep his
[49:36] word so if you read something in the
[49:38] Bible or you hear something in the
[49:39] message God is obligated to back that up
[49:42] in his word so you young people if you
[49:44] want to put your faith in anything put
[49:46] your faith in the word of God that you
[49:49] have been given in this hour there's
[49:51] nothing else that can that can take away
[49:53] or take the place of this word nothing
[49:56] else is going to save you nothing else
[49:58] is going to heal you but if you'll go
[50:00] back to the promise of healing and the
[50:02] promise of Salvation in the word then in
[50:04] those promises you can have faith for
[50:06] your salvation and for your healing and
[50:09] and to defeat every demon of depression
[50:11] and fear and so brother R goes on down
[50:14] he says now look sister you believe me
[50:16] now if you can start from right here by
[50:18] the cross from this night deny you got
[50:20] it go on saying I haven't got it no more
[50:23] and it will leave you so if that Goliath
[50:25] is standing in your way and it says well
[50:27] you're just depressed and you're not
[50:29] worth it you're not you're not going to
[50:30] make it you're scared to death let me
[50:32] tell you you talk back to that devil and
[50:34] say you're nothing but a bluff and you
[50:36] are nothing but a Goliath and I I tell
[50:39] you in the name of the Lord you have no
[50:41] rights on my property you will not defy
[50:44] this body of the Living Lord Jesus
[50:46] Christ on the Earth
[50:48] today that devil has no right over you
[50:51] so we'll deal with fear for a second he
[50:53] says today people are something on the
[50:55] order like that does on on the days when
[50:57] the disciples Was Out on the Ocean and
[50:59] one night a storm came up and there
[51:01] wasn't nothing all hopes was gone that
[51:04] they that they would ever be saved and
[51:06] and and he seen him come walk him come
[51:08] walking on the water now their ship was
[51:10] water logged and the the sails was broke
[51:12] and the oares was gone and they were
[51:14] holding one another and screaming they
[51:16] were scared to death they had
[51:19] fear and he said they looked out there
[51:21] and they seen him come walking on the
[51:23] water and was scared of him their only
[51:25] hope and they were afraid of the only
[51:28] thing that could save them if that ain't
[51:30] a true picture of today he said they
[51:32] thought it looked spooky they thought it
[51:34] was a ghost now he said they cried out
[51:36] for fear it's a spirit it looked too
[51:38] like it looked too spiritual he said
[51:39] that's the same thing it is today but if
[51:42] you just do like they did when they
[51:44] cried out they heard that voice coming
[51:46] fear not it is I Be not Afraid brother R
[51:50] says be of good courage so when that
[51:52] devil of fear when that Goliath named
[51:54] fear tries to stand in your way you can
[51:57] stand there and you can talk to that
[51:59] devil called Goliath and we can call him
[52:01] fear right now and you can say fear has
[52:03] no hold on me I'm no longer a slave to
[52:07] it because the devil has no right on
[52:10] this property of God's can you say Amen
[52:12] you young people don't need to worry
[52:14] about fear you don't need to have fear
[52:16] am I going to make it is the rapture
[52:17] coming yes the rapture's coming the word
[52:19] is true and don't worry about being left
[52:22] behind Just Surrender Your Life to Jesus
[52:24] Christ and just get the baptism of the
[52:26] Holy Ghost if you haven't been baptized
[52:28] I say get baptized in the name of the
[52:30] Lord Jesus Christ St a take a step of
[52:32] faith and let that devil of fear leave
[52:35] you in the name of Jesus can you say
[52:38] Amen so young people if you deal with
[52:41] fear let it go can you say amen Amen Let
[52:45] it go Let The Fear go let the depression
[52:48] go because those are just goliaths that
[52:50] come they look too big they look too
[52:53] hard but is anything too hard for God I
[52:56] say nothing is impossible to them that
[53:00] believe let's go down to complexes here
[53:03] for just a minute brother brandom said I
[53:06] love this quote it really struck me when
[53:08] I read it men just educate themselves
[53:10] till they educate themselves away from
[53:13] one another all fellowship's
[53:15] important they get complexes you don't
[53:18] get no complex by the blood of Jesus
[53:20] Christ you get love can you say Amen sir
[53:23] he said that's that you get love not a
[53:25] complex that I'm a little bigger than
[53:27] somebody else a little better than
[53:29] somebody else and know a little more
[53:31] than somebody else that's a complex that
[53:33] gets on you and sometimes you get a
[53:35] complex well I don't fit in to the youth
[53:37] group or I don't fit in because they
[53:39] they they have nicer clothes than me or
[53:42] I I don't fit in because maybe I'm just
[53:43] too old or I'm too young but let me go
[53:46] and tell you something it don't matter
[53:47] about what the world thinks of you you
[53:49] fit into God's economy why you're a Son
[53:52] of God you're a daughter of God you
[53:54] don't have to worry about what nobody
[53:55] else says don't worry about what that
[53:57] Goliath says he's going to boast and
[53:59] he's going to tell you you're not big
[54:00] enough buddy but he's not big enough to
[54:02] take you out because God that is in you
[54:05] is greater than any giant that you'll
[54:07] ever face brother trip the the god that
[54:10] is in you the God you know the god you
[54:12] serve is greater than any Goliath that
[54:15] can come and try to take you out why
[54:17] because God did not give you that spirit
[54:19] of fear but he gave you a spirit of
[54:21] overcoming he gave you a spirit of
[54:23] winning the battle he already went
[54:25] before you in battle I say it's time to
[54:27] lay down fear it's time to lay down
[54:29] anxiety it's time to lay down complexes
[54:31] that are keeping people from the house
[54:33] of God can you say Amen what I found is
[54:37] complexes will end up ruining you and
[54:40] your walk with God about the time you
[54:42] get an experience with God and then the
[54:44] Devil comes by and he's got to try to
[54:45] get you out of fellowship with God so he
[54:47] gives you a complex can you say Amen but
[54:51] I like what he said the blood of Jesus
[54:53] Christ you get love you get love not a
[54:57] complex can you say Amen every one of us
[55:00] in this building we come from different
[55:01] backgrounds we look different some of
[55:03] you are saying thank the Lord for
[55:05] that we're not related and some of you
[55:07] are saying thank the Lord for that but
[55:10] believe it or not we are all one family
[55:12] united under the blood of Jesus Christ
[55:16] and and whether you like me or not
[55:17] you're going to have to spend eternity
[55:18] with me if you're also under the same
[55:20] blood well can you say
[55:22] amen I I I'm not going to hold you too
[55:25] long tonight if you'll just back me real
[55:26] fast all
[55:27] right but complexes what are complexes
[55:30] it's it's it's all the devil yeah it's
[55:33] all the devil so we find out that David
[55:36] David had every right to have a complex
[55:38] can you say Amen come on David is a
[55:41] ruddy little ugly Shepherd boy let me go
[55:44] over here to the boys and talk to them
[55:45] and tell them how ugly they really
[55:48] are we'll say David looks like uh who
[55:51] wants to be
[55:53] David come here buddy I saw your hand
[55:55] first come here come here all right look
[55:57] at this trip you're obviously Goliath
[56:00] come
[56:02] on are you scared of him no why why are
[56:06] you not scared of
[56:10] him well that's not the answer I was
[56:12] looking for but hey that's okay but just
[56:14] imagine this man coming up to you and
[56:16] he's got a
[56:17] spear and a big yeah great big spear
[56:20] scary isn't it and you don't have
[56:22] nothing but a slingshot do you have a
[56:24] slingshot at home you do I figured you
[56:28] would so you got a slingshot and this is
[56:31] Goliath but man he's got armor he's got
[56:34] I mean he's got brass he's got he's got
[56:35] fingers this
[56:37] long and he's just a huge guy just big
[56:41] isn't he it's big
[56:42] intimidating you're nothing but a
[56:44] Shepherd boy that lived on a
[56:46] farm with your family don't get a
[56:49] complex
[56:51] buddy you're nothing but a Shepherd boy
[56:53] that lived on this farm and and you come
[56:56] down on the hill one day and you're just
[56:58] bringing food to your brothers because
[57:00] they're trained and they're not bigger
[57:02] than you really but they were
[57:04] smarter but your brothers are down there
[57:06] fighting in the
[57:08] Army and you're chosen to come down in
[57:10] this Army and and and and you hear this
[57:12] Goliath over here and he is saying what
[57:15] kind of low down people you
[57:18] are because you're a Shepherd you're a
[57:21] nobody and he thinks he's big
[57:24] stuff he thinks he's all that
[57:27] he don't know you're about to cut his
[57:28] head
[57:32] off so this man is over there making his
[57:35] boast and he's calling you all kinds of
[57:37] bad names and yeah and you're just oh
[57:41] you're scared maybe but what you realize
[57:44] is you realize that one time you
[57:46] encountered a bear and you encountered a
[57:49] lion and by the grace of God you killed
[57:52] both of them and you were still here to
[57:54] tell about it so when this Goliath over
[57:58] here is boasting and all the armies of
[58:01] the Living God who who have seen
[58:03] Miracles before are scared to death
[58:07] they're scared to death because they
[58:08] just don't know how to take on this
[58:10] Goliath but there's a young man over
[58:14] here that has already seen the work of
[58:17] God he has seen the supernatural of God
[58:20] I hope somebody's following me here
[58:22] today he knows who he is because God has
[58:24] already chosen him him for such a time
[58:27] as this and so he's standing here and
[58:30] he's like well I want to go fight that
[58:32] Goliath I want to go fight that Goliath
[58:35] so he goes down and he gets five smooth
[58:37] Stones do you know why he got
[58:40] five tell me just because okay F AI t h
[58:46] what does that
[58:48] spell
[58:51] faith and maybe because Goliath had four
[58:54] brothers he's going to take them all out
[58:58] you imagine four of these guys I bet the
[59:00] other ones were smaller Goliath was
[59:01] probably the Bigg he was the champion of
[59:03] this other
[59:04] Army and you just imagine that the Lord
[59:07] tells you don't fear go ahead and just
[59:11] just take that slingshot get five smooth
[59:13] Stones now the first one was going to
[59:15] kill him but why did he get five because
[59:17] he was in obedience to the word of God I
[59:19] would like to say this if he'd just
[59:21] picked up one and said I'm a good enough
[59:22] shot no he couldn't boast in himself he
[59:24] was boasting in what God had already
[59:26] done for him he wasn't saying I'm big
[59:29] enough no he wasn't big enough to take
[59:31] on this guy but God in him was so great
[59:34] that it didn't matter no weapon that he
[59:37] has formed against him was going to
[59:39] prosper he had the weapons he had the
[59:42] training but this man had God on his

[1:01:50] spirit of David he was a mighty warrior
[1:01:53] and God has Ro Raised Me Up for such a
[1:01:56] time as this God has given me the spirit
[1:01:59] of overcoming in a time when it looks
[1:02:01] like young people are going to fall but
[1:02:03] I'm not just a sta a statistic I am an
[1:02:06] overcomer I'm a David I'm a warrior I'm
[1:02:09] going to fight this battle and we're
[1:02:11] going to win can you say Amen you young
[1:02:15] people don't have to be scared just
[1:02:17] because the devil tells you you can't
[1:02:18] make it in this hour because because
[1:02:20] things are just too hard for you that's
[1:02:22] the devil talking to you just because
[1:02:24] the devil says you've got fear don't you
[1:02:26] listen to that devil that says you got
[1:02:28] fear say I believe God and His word I am
[1:02:31] not going to be
[1:02:33] fearful here's one here that we don't
[1:02:35] deal with very often but
[1:02:37] bitterness bitterness anybody here ever
[1:02:40] had bitterness don't raise your
[1:02:41] hand I'll use
[1:02:43] you bitterness brother BR talks about it
[1:02:47] like this and just a little story about

[1:02:50] quote he said each one of you just
[1:02:52] confess all your wrong confess all your
[1:02:54] unbelief and say Lord Jesus
[1:02:56] maybe I belonged to church once I went
[1:02:58] to church but I was never satisfied
[1:03:00] there was something another oh my I
[1:03:03] might have shouted I might have spoke
[1:03:04] with tongues I might have joined Church
[1:03:06] all those things are fine I have nothing
[1:03:09] against that but that's not what I'm
[1:03:11] talking about I'm talking about the love
[1:03:14] of God that's really down here it's
[1:03:18] really down there that's the Holy Spirit
[1:03:20] that's it and you want that how many

[1:03:40] want to live in the present you're going
[1:03:42] to want Revival after when you start to
[1:03:43] feel your soul get a little dry when you
[1:03:46] start coming to church and you're not
[1:03:47] feeling like you in love with God like
[1:03:49] you used to be it's time to find
[1:03:51] yourself either at the altar or praying
[1:03:53] there at your seat or getting back into
[1:03:55] the word again you young people I'm
[1:03:56] telling you I think we've let ourselves

[1:04:02] let that Revival fire die at camp

[1:04:17] if they do we'll cast that devil
[1:04:20] out we'll cast that devil out that's
[1:04:22] trying to hold you back if you feel to
[1:04:24] Shou in church Shou in church if you
[1:04:26] feel to raise up and say Amen real loud
[1:04:28] I say go right ahead it ain't going to
[1:04:30] hurt me or brother Ben or brother
[1:04:31] Stewart we'll say go right ahead why
[1:04:34] because we want you to have freedom in
[1:04:35] the house of God to believe God on his
[1:04:38] word and to go ahead and pull on the
[1:04:40] gift of God you don't have to be 20
[1:04:42] years old or 30 years old you could be a
[1:04:44] 10y old and when Jesus touches your
[1:04:47] heart to say Amen just go ahead and say
[1:04:49] a great big amen you don't even have to
[1:04:52] wait I know sometimes there's things
[1:04:54] preached when you're young you don't
[1:04:56] understand I know that it happen I still
[1:04:58] don't understand everything so there's
[1:04:59] things all the time I'm like huh that's
[1:05:01] why I'm get in a bald spot I'm
[1:05:02] scratching my head all the
[1:05:04] time you young people though you know
[1:05:06] you know that there's things you may not
[1:05:08] understand but some of you that are real
[1:05:10] young your parents are trying to teach
[1:05:12] you to love Jesus your parents are
[1:05:15] trying to teach you when you get to a
[1:05:16] certain age and you know there's baptism
[1:05:18] is a requirement baptism is not optional
[1:05:21] just
[1:05:22] saying baptism is a requirement now when
[1:05:25] you're baptized that's when the Lord
[1:05:26] works on you and tells you to be
[1:05:28] baptized I say run right while you can
[1:05:31] go tell somebody I want to get baptized
[1:05:32] don't wait don't put that off let that
[1:05:34] desire in your heart let it be fulfilled
[1:05:36] let's let's follow the word when you
[1:05:37] want to follow the word that's the time
[1:05:39] to follow the word that's the time to
[1:05:40] get an action while the while the fire
[1:05:42] is lit go ahead and and do that don't
[1:05:44] don't wait don't put it off and don't
[1:05:46] let somebody talk you out of it can you
[1:05:48] say Amen but I would say it like this
[1:05:50] nobody could talk David out of going
[1:05:53] down there because he'd already seen too
[1:05:55] to much he had already been in the
[1:05:57] presence of the Lord a couple times and
[1:06:00] so he knew that this next time was going
[1:06:02] to be no different so when David walks
[1:06:04] down there he didn't let his complex of
[1:06:07] being little hold him back he didn't let
[1:06:10] his complexes of of who he was from his
[1:06:13] family was all out there in the Army but
[1:06:14] he was left at home tending the Sheep he
[1:06:17] was a sheep herder you could say he was
[1:06:19] a nobody he didn't belong down there
[1:06:21] with the armies that were trying to
[1:06:23] fight for the Living God they he didn't
[1:06:25] belong with the armies a good armies he
[1:06:26] didn't belong with them why because he
[1:06:28] was just a ruddy little boy he did he
[1:06:30] had no training but he had training that
[1:06:32] they didn't know about well can you say
[1:06:35] amen he had training that maybe the
[1:06:37] world wouldn't say was training but he
[1:06:39] had training from God himself because he
[1:06:41] had been with God he had been in the
[1:06:43] presence of God and so he knew how to
[1:06:45] defeat the Devils when they come
[1:06:47] fighting him so I would say young people
[1:06:49] when the devils are coming after you
[1:06:51] don't you let the devil overtake you in
[1:06:54] that situation remember the devil is not
[1:06:57] too big to defeat that's right I know
[1:07:01] sometimes we get to thinking that the
[1:07:02] devils are just too big and we well
[1:07:04] bitterness is just there bitterness is
[1:07:05] for my family and and many times I will
[1:07:07] say that many times us parents need to
[1:07:10] watch out because what we do our bitter
[1:07:12] spirits come right down on our children
[1:07:14] and our our our fear comes right down on
[1:07:16] our our children and our complexes come
[1:07:19] right down on our kids and and all this
[1:07:21] depression it's passed down from
[1:07:23] generation to generation but somebody's
[1:07:25] got toak break the cycle somebody's got
[1:07:27] to stop that cycle from just going
[1:07:29] around and the next thing you know my
[1:07:31] kids have got it your kids have got it
[1:07:33] my grandkids my great grandkids no I say
[1:07:35] now is the time to stop the cycle of
[1:07:38] death and get back into the atmosphere
[1:07:40] of God where you know you can defeat the
[1:07:42] giants that are coming after you yes sir
[1:07:45] so all these things are just the devil
[1:07:47] now I know it's simple if you wanted to
[1:07:49] hear something deep you should have been
[1:07:51] here for this
[1:07:52] morning you're not going to hear tonight
[1:07:55] but some of you young people I think I I
[1:07:56] think that's one of the things that get
[1:07:58] you the worst you you you don't feel
[1:08:00] adequate enough you don't feel great
[1:08:01] enough you don't feel big enough maybe I
[1:08:03] don't you don't feel big enough to be
[1:08:05] part of the service let me go and tell
[1:08:06] you something you are the Church of
[1:08:08] today not just the Church of Tomorrow
[1:08:10] you are the big listen you're a big part
[1:08:12] of the church you you create an
[1:08:14] atmosphere when you sit here and you you
[1:08:16] you start to just stand there and you
[1:08:17] you soak up the word that's being
[1:08:18] preached listen that does my heart good
[1:08:20] I know it does these other brothers when
[1:08:22] they can see young people that are
[1:08:23] getting into the services and and are
[1:08:25] starting to receive from the Lord
[1:08:27] because if there's a deacon for tomorrow
[1:08:29] then somebody's got to be a deacon if
[1:08:31] there's other preachers raised up
[1:08:33] somebody's got to be preachers and you
[1:08:35] young ladies listen don't feel left out
[1:08:37] you young ladies somebody's got to be a
[1:08:39] preacher's wife and somebody's got to be
[1:08:40] a Deacon's wife and somebody just got to
[1:08:42] be a mother to children that could be
[1:08:44] taught about the message of the hour and
[1:08:47] and listen your your responsibilities in
[1:08:49] many ways are much bigger than the boy's
[1:08:50] responsibilities because you grow up and
[1:08:53] and if the if your husband if you ever
[1:08:54] get married I'm I'm not saying you ever
[1:08:56] will and hopefully you don't but if you
[1:08:57] ever get married you want
[1:09:00] to don't look at me like
[1:09:04] that make sure your dad
[1:09:10] approves well she rolled her eyes at me
[1:09:13] hadn't had that happen since I looked at
[1:09:16] trip but you know what think about it if
[1:09:19] you grow up when you grow up you will
[1:09:20] grow up not if when when you grow up you
[1:09:24] may you may marry a preacher God
[1:09:28] forbid your daddy's a preacher you know
[1:09:30] don't you it's pretty
[1:09:32] real yeah it's pretty rough I know yeah
[1:09:37] you know yeah you're not GNA marry
[1:09:39] preacher buddy we don't believe in we
[1:09:41] don't we don't we don't believe in women
[1:09:43] preachers you're
[1:09:46] okay you're all
[1:09:48] right but hey I mean but serious and I'm
[1:09:51] I'm I'm trying to keep this light for
[1:09:52] the kids is that okay is that okay I'm
[1:09:54] just trying to talk to them today
[1:09:56] because listen I think sometimes we got
[1:09:57] to get down here and and be able to
[1:09:59] communicate with them to where they
[1:10:01] understand that God is not a god that is
[1:10:02] a far off but God can live in a heart
[1:10:05] just like this one right here God can
[1:10:07] live in a heart God can live in a this
[1:10:09] little boy right here may be the
[1:10:10] youngest right here the smallest but
[1:10:11] look look at that there's a great big
[1:10:13] God on the inside of that young man and
[1:10:15] inside of that man is a big enough God
[1:10:17] to defeat any devil that ever comes on
[1:10:19] his way I I don't care what the devil's
[1:10:21] done to you I don't care what your
[1:10:23] family has done don't you say he well
[1:10:25] don't don't I'm not going to say don't
[1:10:27] listen to your parents but I'm going to
[1:10:28] tell you if your parents start telling
[1:10:30] you well grandpa had this kind of this
[1:10:32] fear and Grandpa was anxious and Grandpa
[1:10:34] was this I'm going to just tell you
[1:10:36] right now you do not have to sign for
[1:10:38] that because you do not have to have
[1:10:40] those things from your grandparents pass
[1:10:42] down to you I say it's time us parents
[1:10:44] start saying we are not going to let
[1:10:46] depression come through me down to my
[1:10:48] children we are not going to let
[1:10:49] complexes stop me from receiving what I
[1:10:52] need from God and we're sure not going
[1:10:53] to let it stop me and make my children
[1:10:55] have to suffer the same way I'm
[1:10:57] suffering listen you I I don't say that
[1:10:59] there these are not real Devils these
[1:11:00] are real Devils Goliath was a real being
[1:11:03] Goliath was a real enemy Goliath was
[1:11:05] something real and he was big I'm not
[1:11:08] I'm not denying that what I'm saying is
[1:11:10] the god in David was bigger than that
[1:11:13] scare tactic that the devil tried to
[1:11:15] throw at the armies of the Living God
[1:11:18] that was just a fear tactic that was
[1:11:20] just something to scare the armies of
[1:11:22] God but see God was greater God was G
[1:11:25] and bigger God already knew they would
[1:11:27] send Goliath out but he already had a
[1:11:29] Shepherd boy being prepared listen you
[1:11:31] may not look like much you may not have
[1:11:33] an office in the church and you may just
[1:11:35] feel like a nobody but let me go ahead
[1:11:37] and tell you something if God has
[1:11:39] ordained for you to be something God
[1:11:41] will use you in the way that he wants to
[1:11:43] use you you young sisters don't you ever
[1:11:46] feel like God's not going to use you
[1:11:48] he's got great things planned for your
[1:11:50] life you young Brothers God's got great
[1:11:52] things planned for your life he don't
[1:11:53] want you to be scarred by the things of
[1:11:55] the world he wants you to have a
[1:11:56] testimony that I did not go out I did
[1:11:59] not fall away but I stayed right here
[1:12:02] with the message of the hour and I
[1:12:04] believe in everything that God said
[1:12:06] you're not in this message you're not in
[1:12:08] this message because your parents are
[1:12:10] here God put your parents in the message
[1:12:12] so that you could be
[1:12:15] here you're not just here by chance God
[1:12:19] knew God knew that your God knew your
[1:12:21] mom trip needed to be in church that's
[1:12:23] why you're here today you say well well
[1:12:25] it's because my parents know God had to
[1:12:27] put them in a place so that you could be
[1:12:29] in your place well can you say amen God
[1:12:31] had to put you by Bill in your place so
[1:12:33] that so that your kids could be in their
[1:12:34] place and don't look at the
[1:12:36] circumstances of how big the devil is
[1:12:38] that is trying to hold that over your
[1:12:39] kids because God is greater than every
[1:12:42] devil that is trying to hold your kids
[1:12:44] back you young people well come on
[1:12:47] somebody you are not just going to make
[1:12:49] it just barely you are Overcomers you
[1:12:53] are people that are going to overcome
[1:12:54] these Devils somebody's going to
[1:12:56] overcome Temptation somebody's going to
[1:12:59] overcome these things why because the
[1:13:01] spirit that was in Christ and raised him
[1:13:03] from the dead it will Quicken your body
[1:13:06] is it important to accept Jesus Christ I
[1:13:07] say it is because if you accept his
[1:13:10] Spirit then you can defeat those same
[1:13:12] Devils he was tempted in all like manner
[1:13:14] he even spoke to the Devil Himself and
[1:13:16] when he was sitting up there he used the
[1:13:18] same he used something that the weakest
[1:13:20] Christian brother random said could use
[1:13:22] on the devil it was an example made for
[1:13:24] the weakest as Christian how many knows
[1:13:26] what that
[1:13:27] was that he could defeat the Devil by
[1:13:31] the word of God he didn't have to jump
[1:13:34] through hoops he didn't have to listen I
[1:13:36] believe in jumping and screaming and
[1:13:37] hollering and I wish somebody would do
[1:13:39] it sometimes and maybe it'll be me I
[1:13:41] don't know don't don't condemn me if I
[1:13:44] do if I do I promise it's the Lord my
[1:13:47] watch is telling me my time's up it
[1:13:48] can't
[1:13:49] be we'll just turn that
[1:13:53] off I'm on almost done but listen listen
[1:13:56] let's just let's just bring this down
[1:13:57] for a
[1:13:58] minute the devil is going to try to
[1:14:01] tempt you let's talk to these older
[1:14:03] young people some of you sitting three
[1:14:05] rows
[1:14:07] back sometimes the devil's going to deal
[1:14:09] with these young men in ways I'm GNA say
[1:14:13] this to some of you Elders there's
[1:14:14] there's things that you did not
[1:14:16] experience that these young men have
[1:14:18] experienced or will experience that's
[1:14:21] just the truth of it we're living in an
[1:14:22] age of Technology where there's phones
[1:14:24] there's computers there's there's things
[1:14:27] that some people just didn't even know
[1:14:28] existed until 20 years ago or 30 years
[1:14:30] ago I didn't I'm only 31 years old and
[1:14:33] did you know that I didn't have a cell
[1:14:34] phone until I left home at 17 18 however
[1:14:37] old I
[1:14:38] was and and it was a flip phone but it
[1:14:42] had a cty board no it didn't have a c
[1:14:43] board I had I got one of those that slid
[1:14:45] open and had a cord board on it I
[1:14:47] thought it was
[1:14:49] high-tech and guess what we had at home
[1:14:51] for a computer we had dial up internet
[1:14:53] when I met my wife
[1:14:56] online I mean when I started talking to
[1:14:58] her
[1:15:01] online didn't meet her online I met her
[1:15:03] at to wedding she caught the bouquet at
[1:15:04] my brother and sister-in-law's wedding
[1:15:06] yeah it was awesome I was like that's
[1:15:08] the one that's it but but you know what
[1:15:11] happened was we had dial up so I would
[1:15:13] send a message on Facebook Messenger
[1:15:15] this is a long time ago you know I mean
[1:15:16] I'm we're going to be married 13 years
[1:15:18] in two days so it's a long time
[1:15:20] ago but but I would send a message and
[1:15:23] it would take 15 minutes to be
[1:15:25] delivered because you'd sit there and
[1:15:27] you'd see this bar go like this and I'd
[1:15:29] sit there and watch it you talk about
[1:15:33] Insanity all for a girl you know I mean
[1:15:37] just wanted to talk then I found out I
[1:15:39] could talk to her on the phone that made
[1:15:40] a little easier but where I lived I had
[1:15:43] to put my cell phone on top of my
[1:15:44] dresser in a certain position where it
[1:15:45] get one
[1:15:46] bar and it wasn't actually mine it was
[1:15:49] dad's and so you know he he wanted at a
[1:15:52] certain time so I could only so anyway
[1:15:56] bless your heart I got problems but
[1:16:00] listen church I never thought my kid
[1:16:02] would tell me in church I got
[1:16:06] problems but you know what you'll do a
[1:16:08] lot of things and you're going to do but
[1:16:10] even now now it's nothing like that now
[1:16:13] everything's instant everything's
[1:16:14] instant you've got instant messaging
[1:16:16] you've got WhatsApp and Facebook and
[1:16:18] Instagram and Snapchat and youve got all
[1:16:19] these all these things and I'm listen
[1:16:22] I'm not saying any of those things are
[1:16:23] bad but if they're used wrong
[1:16:25] and remember the devil is in is in this
[1:16:28] end time the devil wants us to be so
[1:16:30] smart that and he can use these tools to
[1:16:33] get into our minds he can use these
[1:16:34] tools to hurt our young people I'm just
[1:16:36] going to take five minutes is that okay
[1:16:38] but that's the devil trying to use
[1:16:40] something maybe good to harm you you
[1:16:44] young people have not experienced these
[1:16:45] young little young ones up here haven't
[1:16:47] experienced
[1:16:48] that and I know I've got a 12-year-old
[1:16:50] and they you know we've talked about a
[1:16:52] phone and all that but God forbid you
[1:16:54] know I mean what are they going to get
[1:16:55] into and the problem is the devil listen
[1:16:58] it's not always bad kids either you say
[1:17:01] these are angels I agree these are some
[1:17:03] of the best kids ever but what I'm just
[1:17:04] telling you is that that the devil is
[1:17:06] there trying to get our kids attention
[1:17:09] you think everything on the internet's
[1:17:10] good then some of you Elders need to
[1:17:11] take a
[1:17:13] look don't really but you but our young
[1:17:17] people man that's the devil that's a
[1:17:19] Goliath in our end time that nobody else
[1:17:21] has ever had to face but it is a real
[1:17:23] devil but it's not something you have to
[1:17:25] bow down to it's not something you have
[1:17:28] to even fear why because we we just put
[1:17:30] that devil down we cut its head off and
[1:17:34] we say that devil is not going to defy
[1:17:37] this body that devil is not going to
[1:17:39] overtake this young person that devil is
[1:17:42] not going to make me do things oh come
[1:17:44] on somebody the devil is not going to
[1:17:46] win this
[1:17:49] battle it's just the
[1:17:52] devil the devil is in a lot of things
[1:17:55] things but I want you to know that God
[1:17:58] is in you and if you'll just let God be
[1:18:01] in you then listen I you know your
[1:18:04] parents when they tell you no that's God
[1:18:05] in them a lot of times telling you no
[1:18:08] that'll make you think before you say I
[1:18:09] don't agree with my parents that might
[1:18:10] be God speaking to
[1:18:12] you because many times God has given the
[1:18:15] a spirit of wisdom to your parents and
[1:18:17] and sometimes your parents are just
[1:18:19] speaking from Pure experience I know I
[1:18:21] don't want you to do that because I've
[1:18:23] been there
[1:18:25] right sometimes that's just a parent
[1:18:27] speaking sometimes the parents just got
[1:18:29] to be just tell a kid no there ain't no
[1:18:31] explanation because you don't need to
[1:18:33] know and when you get old enough to find
[1:18:35] out then that's between you and the Lord
[1:18:36] but right now it's a no you know so
[1:18:40] anyway that's okay I thought I'd get
[1:18:41] some amens out of that but nobody wants
[1:18:44] to be told no do
[1:18:46] they nobody want brother brother Logan
[1:18:48] you ever tell your kids no all the
[1:18:51] time sometimes it feels like that's all
[1:18:53] you know wonder why my kid learn no
[1:18:56] before before any other word that's his
[1:18:58] first word was no it's because that's
[1:19:00] what we're telling him all the time is
[1:19:01] no no stop no no no should have named
[1:19:05] him Noah
[1:19:07] no no trip you're told no no even now I
[1:19:11] bet you get told no guarantee
[1:19:15] it yeah you ever get told
[1:19:18] no yeah I know you do
[1:19:27] I just got told on phone quit telling
[1:19:29] people no all
[1:19:30] right listen what you're going to find
[1:19:33] out is the devil is there to say well
[1:19:36] you won't surely die it'll be okay just
[1:19:40] this one time but listen I just want to
[1:19:42] tell you this this is from my heart just
[1:19:43] for a second what you're going to find
[1:19:46] out is when the devil gets you to do
[1:19:47] something then you have condemnation in
[1:19:48] your heart you feel bad about it because
[1:19:50] you're really a good kid and maybe
[1:19:52] you're even saved maybe you even got the
[1:19:54] holy ghost but you've messed up because
[1:19:56] the devil has has has tempted you into
[1:19:58] something listen that does not mean
[1:20:00] you're
[1:20:02] lost don't you ever let somebody tell
[1:20:04] you you're lost if you if you've been
[1:20:05] baptized you hold on to that promise of
[1:20:07] the Holy Ghost I don't care what
[1:20:08] Temptation the devil pulls towards you
[1:20:11] or throws at you listen you don't have
[1:20:13] to be lost young
[1:20:18] people God has not given us the spirit
[1:20:21] of fear but he's given us the spirit of
[1:20:23] an overcoming he's given us the spirit
[1:20:25] to defeat the Devil he's given us he's
[1:20:28] given us the ability through him that
[1:20:30] he's already won the battle he's already
[1:20:32] won the war all you've got to do is stay
[1:20:35] in his presence and stay under the blood
[1:20:37] of Jesus Christ don't let you don't let
[1:20:39] no devil come and tell you that you're
[1:20:41] not good enough to make it in this

[1:20:44] people when the Lord comes back you're
[1:20:46] going to be there you're not going to be
[1:20:48] left behind you're not going to be I
[1:20:50] don't care what the devil says I don't
[1:20:52] care what anybody tries to tell you if
[1:20:54] some preacher stands up there and says
[1:20:56] you might be lost I say you tell that
[1:20:58] preacher I've already went with Jesus
[1:20:59] and I've been baptized and I'm holding
[1:21:01] on to a promise I am not going to be
[1:21:04] lost hold on to that testimony young
[1:21:07] people I'm not going to be lost I I've
[1:21:09] got a desire in my heart God has placed
[1:21:12] you in in this time in this church in
[1:21:15] that seat for such a time as this when
[1:21:18] it looked like you shouldn't have been
[1:21:19] here you're here anyway when it looked
[1:21:22] like David should have never fought
[1:21:23] Goliath he went down anyway why because
[1:21:26] it was God's man and God's provided time
[1:21:29] and God's provided Place God's provided
[1:21:31] way and the next thing you know that
[1:21:33] devil could not withstand what David had
[1:21:37] oh come on some somebody ought to just
[1:21:38] go with me here for a second David had
[1:21:40] something bigger than the devil he had
[1:21:42] faith in God David had something bigger
[1:21:44] when he was back there on the back side
[1:21:46] of the desert or out there with the
[1:21:47] Sheep he learned something that those
[1:21:49] men down in the Army never learned he
[1:21:50] learned that God could overcome the
[1:21:52] spirit of a bear and God could overcome
[1:21:54] the spirit of a lion and God could God
[1:21:57] could take him as a as a nobody and make
[1:21:59] him a king but before he could ever
[1:22:02] become a king he had to face Goliath and
[1:22:04] before you can ever reach your full
[1:22:07] potential as a Christian then remember
[1:22:09] you may have to fight Goliath and every
[1:22:11] son that comes to God must first be
[1:22:14] tested and tried you're going to face
[1:22:15] Goliath you're going to face the bear
[1:22:17] you're going to face the lion but you're
[1:22:19] not going to be defeated because you are
[1:22:22] one of God's chosen people people for

[1:22:48] Living God he has no right to defy the
[1:22:51] young people in the message of the hour
[1:22:53] he has no red over us and we are more
[1:22:56] than able to take the land we are more
[1:22:58] than able to take Goliath we are more

[1:30:22] decision if you if you feel it in your
[1:30:24] heart to be baptized don't wait I know
[1:30:28] your parents won't make you
[1:30:29] wait they want you to be baptized
[1:30:32] because then after you're baptized
[1:30:34] you've got a
[1:30:35] promise of the Holy Ghost and it's a
[1:30:38] whole lot easier to fight these Devils
[1:30:39] with the Holy Ghost because then it's
[1:30:42] not you it's something on the inside of
[1:30:45] you that raises up like David I'm not
[1:30:46] scared of that giant no more I'm not
[1:30:49] scared why because God had already taken
[1:30:52] this young man and used
[1:30:55] him and then a prophet would anoint this
[1:30:58] young man to go out to battle he looked
[1:31:01] and the father might have picked his
[1:31:02] other Sons first and said well this
[1:31:04] one's bigger this one's better this
[1:31:06] one's older he's wiser but God just
[1:31:09] wanted somebody he could use God wanted
[1:31:12] somebody who wasn't scared of the
[1:31:14] Goliath if God wanted to he could have
[1:31:16] just come down himself if God wanted to
[1:31:18] he could have used
[1:31:19] Saul but he came in a simple way because
[1:31:21] he knew there would be some simple
[1:31:23] humble people
[1:31:25] that needed to know that they too could
[1:31:27] fight Goliath can you say Amen you young
[1:31:31] people if you have a desire on your
[1:31:32] heart if you want to be prayed for I'll
[1:31:33] pray with you if you just want to kneel
[1:31:36] at the altar you can if you want to just
[1:31:37] pray right where you're at in the seat
[1:31:39] you can pray but if I leave you with
[1:31:42] anything if you have depression in your
[1:31:45] life or maybe some family member has
[1:31:48] told you well it runs in the family
[1:31:50] speak to that devil of depression not to
[1:31:53] the family member
[1:31:54] but the devil of depression and tell
[1:31:56] that tell that devil of depression
[1:31:58] you're not going to live in this
[1:31:59] house you're not going to live in this
[1:32:01] young lady you're not going to live in
[1:32:03] these young men you're not going to live
[1:32:06] in these young sisters back here why
[1:32:07] because depression has no right in your
[1:32:12] property fear complexes the root of
[1:32:16] bitterness none of this none of these
[1:32:19] things has a right in our young people
[1:32:22] can you say Amen
[1:32:24] so I wonder if you just bow your heads
[1:32:26] for a moment and if you have any of
[1:32:29] these
[1:32:30] things worried about what kids at school
[1:32:34] say worried about what somebody talks
[1:32:36] about you worried about if
[1:32:39] somebody somebody just thinks you're
[1:32:41] crazy thinks you're
[1:32:44] weird just be like a David and say it
[1:32:47] don't matter if if the world's armor
[1:32:49] doesn't fit it doesn't
[1:32:52] matter because I'm going to defeat that
[1:32:54] devil that's coming after me anyway if
[1:32:57] you just close your eyes bow your heads
[1:32:59] you young people just for a few
[1:33:01] moments just pray in your own way
[1:33:05] Heavenly Father you see these young
[1:33:06] people here
[1:33:08] today Lord I just spoke with what's on
[1:33:10] my heart I hope Lord that there would be
[1:33:12] one of these young people today that
[1:33:13] would just hear the word Lord and Lord I
[1:33:18] don't want this age of pressure and
[1:33:20] anxiety to take out any of our young
[1:33:22] people
[1:33:24] but Lord I pray Lord tonight that they
[1:33:26] would make a decision that this is that
[1:33:28] they're going to take the way with the
[1:33:30] Lord's despised few or they're going to
[1:33:32] take the way with the Lord's the the
[1:33:34] Lord's way they're going to walk in the
[1:33:35] word that they've been so they've been
[1:33:38] so attentive to tonight and Lord I pray
[1:33:41] that you would just move on these young
[1:33:42] people if there's one that hasn't been
[1:33:44] baptized I pray Lord you would just
[1:33:46] speak to their hearts Lord Jesus so that
[1:33:48] they would be baptized and Lord these
[1:33:51] young people that have been baptized I
[1:33:52] pray that you would just F them with the
[1:33:54] Holy Ghost Lord Lord may this be a night
[1:33:57] where they could just consecrate
[1:33:58] themselves to you and say I'm not going
[1:34:00] to have fear any longer I'm not going to
[1:34:03] worry about what the world thinks about
[1:34:04] me I'm not going to give in to that
[1:34:06] devil that tries to come after me but
[1:34:08] I'm going to commit my life to Jesus
[1:34:10] Christ tonight and I'm going to be a
[1:34:12] warrior like David and I'm going to
[1:34:15] stand in the face of every devil and say
[1:34:18] My God Is Bigger he's greater than you
[1:34:20] he's better than you I pray you would
[1:34:22] just move upon our young people tonight
[1:34:23] May there be a Revival among them Lord
[1:34:26] may they just hear the word and Lord may
[1:34:28] they just respond to it and may there be
[1:34:29] something quickened in their lives Lord
[1:34:31] that they would just follow after you I
