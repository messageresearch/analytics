pray in Jesus name amen thank the Lord thank the Lord we're going to read from 1 Corinthians chapter 15 tonight 1 Corinthians 15:51 amen so good to be with you tonight 1 Corinthians 1551 good to have all of you with us tonight I saw a shame one or too God bless you thank you for coming to tonight and each one of you that are here and brother Curtis back there and uh I I just always enjoy preaching to the people of God and always thankful when you're here and uh just I really got something on my heart this afternoon so you just bear with me and I won't take all night we'll just let the Lord do what he wants to do 1 Corinthians 15:51 behold I show you a mystery we shall not all sleep but we shall all be changed in a moment moment in the twinkling of an eye at the last Trump for the trumpet shall sound and the dead shall be raised incorruptable and we shall be changed what a great promise that is amen I pray the Lord would add his Blessing to the word you may be seated this afternoon there's a constant desire for change that we have in our lives I think the Bible calls that GR gring we groan in this we groan earnestly Desiring Paul says to for our body our house that's made it's in the heavens and he said we have one waiting there we're we're earnestly Desiring for that we want to be changed I think that's why we we want to improve things I know I drive people crazy here at the church because we're always changing stuff and trying to fix stuff and make it worse for a while and make it better for a while and we're always trying to do something I think that speaks of a change we're we're looking for something we're not happy just exactly where you are I know a lot of people want a better house or better car or more money there's a change you want to see change you want better health you want better things but there's better times coming how many believe that church listen Paul said if we if we only have hope in this life we are of all men most miserable but if we have hope in this life we can look forward to a change we can look forward we we have hope in the other in the life beyond the grave we can look forward to a time when things will be different and all wrongs will be made right and every knot that's been tied on this side will be untied over there and I'm so grateful for that church because I recognize there's some things I can't fix I know that there's some things that no matter how hard I try no matter how much counseling I do how much work that I do how even in myself there I'm going to get older there's something as much as I try to improve and do better and and whatever it is that I try to do I'm going to I you're just marching towards the grave but you also know that there's something better coming there's a better day coming there's a better place to go to I don't want us to get bogged down in this world too long we don't need to get our focus on what's going on down here and on each other and our problems and all situations we need to look and see that there's something coming for the believer that's far beyond anything he said eye is not seen ear is not heard neither can be contained in the even in the mind of a man what God has waiting for those oh I believe that tonight at some point it's got to become real to us at some point it's got to be more than just a story at some point it's got to be a reality we believe God's going to do something he has done something for us amen excuse me tonight before Abraham and Sarah could have a child it goes without saying something had to happen now we know that Abraham journeyed from the place where he was this is how we know that something happened right something happened right after the angel spoke to him how many know that that angel was a type that the one that came to him Elohim in a body it was a type that happened in our age of the revealing of the son of man right we've seen that Ministry in our time right we've experienced that we're not looking for that that happened right so now something happened between then and Genesis chapter 20 because Genesis 19 Genesis 18 tells the story of the of the three strangers Genesis 19 tells the story of of lot and Sodom and Genesis 20 tells the story of Abraham taking a journey a really long journey through desert country now remember at this time he's a hundred years old and Sarah is 90 now I know 100 ain't what it used to be but people were stronger back then but not that much stronger right because the Bible tells us that they were well stricken in age and I don't think you need that explained to you I think we all know what that means right he looked and acted like an old man she looked and acted like a young woman and that's why she responded the way that she did the way that all of us did or would or any thinking person would if they were presented with this idea you're going to have a baby and she laughed and we would laugh too cuz she's 90 years old and again I don't have to tell some of y'all what 90 looks like I'm going to pick on sister Fritz I think she went home is she still here she went home and sister Fritz was here this morning she said I had a bad night but I'm going to have a good day and I thank God for people like that thank the Lord but she's 91 I believe can you imagine for a moment right now she's going to take a 300M Journey from from where they were to guar they're going to go into this country and when they go into this country look at that next verse I think I've got the next verse on there when they go into this country Abraham said of Sarah his wife she is my sister now I don't think if she looked 90 at that time he'd be too worried about it right I'm not saying anything against our elderly early folks but but you're just not too worried about it but the reason he's concerned remember it happened before and and and he's concerned because she's beautiful she's not old anymore and so he's 100 years old she's 90 and he said she is my sister and ailec king of grar sent and took Sarah but God came to ailec in a Dream by night and said to him behold thou are but a dead man for the woman which the woman which I was taken she is a man's wife now think about it she's 90 she's granny Fritz's age right she's just a little bit older than brother Bill and sister Karen think about it for a minute and Abraham said we got to lie that flat out lie or tell a half truth anyway and and AMC the king a young king he's going to stand there and he's looking around just minding his own business and here come these Travelers through and he sees a 90-year-old woman you know kind of hobbling through and she's got her shaww on she's got a she got a cane you know and she just barely able to make it you know shaking down through the oh you know Abraham I don't know if I'm going be able to make the rest of this journey and Abraham said oh my she's beautiful I keep imagine AMC the king saying that look at that oh my I think I want that for a wife he wasn't saying that about a 90-year-old woman something happened right now look this happened after after they were well stricken in age after they'd received the promise of a child and they go down to a place that they couldn't have gotten to at that age and and something happened that couldn't have happened at that age and and and and the King wanted to marry Grandma so brother Brown uses the absurdity of that statement he says ridiculous nonsense she wasn't a little grandma oh my God turned her back to a young beautiful woman again he said that's what he's going to do to every one of you in the Rapture think about it church every one of you Hallelujah she got she was so beautiful that a king said hey I want her to be my wife well I tell you what that's what God's doing for every one of us brother brand says God don't patch up nothing he just made a brand new Sarah hallelujah oh I think this ought to make us rejoice tonight he just made a brand new Sarah to show what he's going to do to all you old women Hallelujah some of these times that'll believe on the Lord Jesus Hallelujah look now Abraham and Sarah were old people it's all right to confess I'm old but I'm not going to be old for long I'm old I'm getting older my body's failing but it's not going to be that way for I know you young people don't know what I'm talking about but as you get older things start happening to you and all of you can confess that today things that you never expected to have to go through and you can't do what you always wanted and you're strong in your mind but weak in your body and you're unable to do what you used to do but there's coming a time you're going to be changed back and I'm glad I'm not going to be changed back to 40 I'm not going to be changed back to 309 I'm going to be changed back to Perfection to the moment when I was at my strongest to the picture that he had of me of the thought he thought towards me before the foundation of the world Hallelujah Bible said they were well stricken in age he said now what he proved through Abraham and what he did for Abraham and Sarah he's going to do I want you to take this promise and just grab a hold of it tonight take it and grab a hold of it and say this is for me you young people you may not understand why this is important but you will one day take a hold of it and grab a hold of it and say this is for me this is what's going to happen for me he's going to do for all of Abraham's seed and he taught us he said read it like a love letter read between the lines right because it doesn't say her body changed but it had to have changed right and thank God for a prophet who could reveal that to us so and so that something that we believe as message people you're not going to find that taught in a Baptist Church or a Methodist Church or somewhere else we find that we believe that we believe the scripture shows us that but a prophet had to reveal it so he said I can just imagine Abraham the next morning now when did it happen after the angel came I want you to get this understand it was the next thing the body change is the next thing hold that in your heart the next thing to happen after the after the angel came to uh and revealed the secrets of Sarah's heart the next thing brother BR said he woke up the next morning getting up saying why Sarah you know what why say your wrinkles are going out of your face might have thought he had a stranger just earlier you know you get old and things are different you know I see my brother a couple times a year and lives in ill Illinois and he was up here today and he come and knocked on my door to tell me goodbye tonight and I didn't immediately go to it and I I walked over there and I saw him walking away I saw the back and I said hello there's something you wanted I didn't realize who it was I didn't even know him from from behind I thought oh my I think that's what it's going to be maybe when we look at each other before we realize even that we've been changed we're going to look at one another and say hey wait a minute weren't you old you know some people are actually going to gain years but that's a thought for another day it's true though but you going look by The Herald and just all of a sudden like wait a minute the hair is the same but weren't you old why Sarah you know what why I say your wrinkles are going out of your face oh my I wonder what kind of wrinkle cream she used she saidwell Dad look you know what that stoop in your shoulders coming out they was turning back God can do all things somebody believe that tonight brother brand says what's the next thing after this sign goes away now this is a this is a teaching that'll keep you out of a lot of trouble when people come to you and say this is what you should be looking for this is the bride's Revival this is what you ought to look for what's the next thing after the sign goes away God's going to condition Abraham's children you realize what he's doing for us now he's changing the inside so that we can be ready to be changed on the outside that's why we come and hear the word that's why the message is never going to go out of style that's why we never need to quit preaching it we don't ever need to quit getting into the word and digging into the Mysteries that why do we dig into these things why do we give you why do I read so many quotes it's because this message is feeding our Insight it's changing us to make us ready to be changed on the outside God is conditioning Abraham's children getting us ready to receive the promised son you come to church you didn't even realize it but God's getting you ready for something he's conditioning you because we didn't have the character to to go we didn't have the ability but God is conditioning us making us ready oh my making us ready now look he said how are we going to receive him we can't receive him in these bodies we're going to meet him in the air praise God forever the trumpet shall sound the dead in Christ shall rise and we shall go up to meet him in the air what's he doing the last sign before the Transfiguration the last sign before the Rapture for most any time the atomic bomb is going to destroy the world before it scream into this case Jesus is coming amen we which are alive and remain shall not prevent or hinder those that are asleep dead but the trumpet of God shall s the dead in Christ rise which our alive should be changed in a moment of the twinkling of an eye an old man will be young Hallelujah I've never been able to fellowship with some of you in a young body either because you're younger than me and I'm old or because you're older than me and you're old older but one day we'll Fellowship in similar bodies around the same age oh my look look what he says now he says an old man will be young an old woman will be young again and we'll be conditioned to meet the promised coming son he said Glory Hallelujah the next thing in God's order Hallelujah the next thing then what God called me to do keep up the conditioning preach the word amen preach the word if I die and go by way of the grave and God raises up another generation preach the word you young men what do we do what can we do preach the word people will come and go revivals will come and go the churches will rise and fall men will come and go great men will come great men will go families will come together and be torn apart sickness will come all kinds of things will happen what are we doing the next thing is the body change we just keep doing what we're doing and during the delay we don't start smiting one another we don't start preaching at one another we don't start yelling and screaming at one another and causing each other problems what do we do we keep preaching the word we keep doing what God called us to do we keep living the word and one day one morning we're going to be changed you said when it's going to happen brother man I don't have a clue when it's going to happen but I know this this the next thing Hallelujah Paul gives us the the doctrine of the resurrection and Body Change in 1 Corinthians 15 I don't have time to read all this but would be good to go read it if you have time but in 1 Corinthians 15:12 brother or Paul says now if Christ be preached and he rose from the dead how say some among you that there is no resurrection of the dead but if there be no there were idiots back then too I'm sorry sorry kids come on Church there have always been stupid people I don't know of another way to put it and there always will be they're going to come up with all kinds of nonsense he said if there be no resurrection of the Dead Christ is not risen right and if Christ be not risen then is our preaching Vain and your faith is also vain yay and we are found false Witnesses of God because we've testified of God that he raised up Christ whom he raised not up it so be that the dead raised not for if the dead rise not then is not Christ raised and if Christ be not raised your faith is vain you're yet in your sins so it took more than the death and burial of Christ it took the resurrection of Christ because it was the resurrection of Christ that show us that the death worked and the burial oh church that that was effective for our sins anybody can die on a cross but no one but him could be raised again on the third day right he was the first fruits of that Resurrection so he says he said uh if Christ be not raised your dead and your sins then they also which are fallen asleep in Christ or perish I've already quoted this but if if in this life only we have hope in Christ we are of all men most miserable but now it's Christ risen from the dead become the first fruits of them that slept for Since By Man Came Death by man came also the resurrection of the Dead for as in Adam all die even so in Christ shall all be made alive but every man in his own order now notice there's an order to the resurrection and and the body change the Rapture he said Christ the first fruits afterward they that are Christ at his coming so brother brandom puts it this way and I just want to go through some things he said about it and kind of just feed us on that it's okay just eat for a little bit he said his great glorious presence shall strike the Earth he cometh in clouds he said oh I love that clouds there will be wave after wave of his glory will come across the earth and the resurrection of the Saints shall come Hallelujah he said when that blessed holy spirit that lived in their hearts and they died you see young people why it's so important to have the Holy Ghost yeah right because you can't go it's like the Chinese Laundry he said when they tore the ticket apart he said it had to you had to have the matching ticket or you couldn't get your clothes back right and you can't go in the Rapture unless your your spirit that's in you matches his Spirit right because that's what it is the holy spirit that's what raises you up and so he said when that blessed Holy Spirit that's lived in their hearts and they died with their corpse laying there and the tear stains over their cheeks and things like that and they're placed out here in the graveyard he said a great wave of that same Spirit Church you wonder why we enjoy church so much don't tell me we love God too he said whether been your Pentecostal no I just love him with all of my heart don't tell me I can't worship him don't tell me I can't raise my hands don't tell me I'm too loud when I know that the same spirit that he lets me feel here one of these days is going to take me up one of these days is going to lift me out of my condition and make me a brand new man are you with me he's coming for that that ought to give all of us hope that same holy spirit that we feel right now wave after wave he says hallelujah he said a wave after wave he said they're placed out here in the graveyard a great wave of that same spirit and whoosh wave after wave he that was last will be first he that was first will be last how can it be that way that's the order of the Resurrection he said I won't know nobody in the generation before me or the generation after me I'll know those in the generation of this so now here's here's a detail he's given us about the resurrection it's important we'll be raised with people we know right you'll recognize the people you see now church I know we all want to see the prophet you know we all want to be a but but you'll be raised with your own generation people you knew thank you Lord for some of you you've lost a spouse that's the first one you'll see thank you Lord right some of you lost a child be the first one you see huh you be raised with you God knows what he's doing he said I won't know nobody in the generation before me the generation after me I'll know those in the generation of this see if I rais this by the brandom's generation and and just that's the first ones I see I won't know a lot of them I've only seen some of them in pictures and most of them I don't know but I'm raised with my own generation so I'll be raised in and there'll be a few folks from Christian Tabernacle there and me but I knew them see so I might I see them oh there's brother you know some of the brothers and sisters we've seen around here that we buried right that I've known some of the older the ministers that come before me right that have gone on brother John LEF Fontaine was here for many years and and several years and he's gone now I believe I'll see him because I knew him maybe his family will see him first but I'll see him I'll see those that I knew we begin to get together we'll see people oh Church ones you were close to ones that meant something to you Hallelujah and they'll come up they'll come up and and he said here he said they're placed down great great he that was last to be first he said I want nobody in the generation before me the generation after me I'll know there in a generation of this every generation will come successfully right as it went down he said they which were last will be first sure it has to be see I'll know my people I believe every one of you I'm going to see you if you go by way of the Grave before the end or if I go by way of the Grave we're going to see one another whoever's alive is going to see first the one that's raised and then we look down realize we've been changed hallelujah amen now look he said the next fell he said I know my people the next fellow my dad will know his people his grandfather his people on down like that wave after wave after wave after wave and the Saints arising from everywhere won't that be wonderful he said that makes the old people feel young again oh my see we've got to be changed Paul teaches us in 1 Corinthians 15:50 he said now this I say brother flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God and that would be a revelation some of you say well I've never been able to get my flesh and blood to really obey the gospel well they won't that's why you have to have the Holy Ghost that's why you can't serve God you can't say Jesus is Lord without the Holy Ghost why because he will not be Lord of your life unless there's some control tower controlling your body and your spirit right because if you don't have the Holy Ghost That Body and spirit's going to they're going to control you your emotions will control you right and with the Holy Ghost we have to let him then surrender to that because the outside part's still not saved it's just under control right so we still have to give in to the Holy Ghost surrender to the that's why it doesn't hurt us to come to the altar it doesn't hurt us to seek God it doesn't hurt come on church we may have been Christians for a long time but it doesn't hurt nothing to seek God and ask for prayer and say I just need help with something there have been a lot of things that's happened in your life would be lot better if you just asked for help down the line and said I just need somebody to pray with me I can't do it on my own I need help with this maybe you could ask the Lord I Lord I need a rebaptism of your spirit I need you to help me with this decision I need you to help me with the thing I'm going through because two-thirds of you is unsaved but if there's something on the inside that's been changed it'll control that right but now look he said Flesh and Blood can't inherit the kingdom of God neither does corruption inherit incorruption behold I show you a mystery we shall not all sleep but we shall all be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye at the last Trump for the trumpet shall sound the dead shall be raised Incorruptible and we shall be changed for this corruptible must put on incorruption this Mortal must put on immortality it's not optional it's got to happen so when this corruptible shall I put on incorruption and this Mortal shall they put on immortality then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written death is swallowed up in Victory Oh my he gives us the order of the of the Rapture in 1 Thessalonians 4:13 I would not have you to be ignorant Brethren concerning them which are asleep that you sorrow not even as others which have no hope for if we believe that Jesus died and rose again even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him for this we say unto you by the word of the Lord I know there's let me just stop here for a minute I know there's things people say well not everything Paul says matters I believe this mattered you want to leave this out I don't cuz what hope would we have of a Rapture without this promise we which are alive and remain shall not prevent them with I want that to be there I want that and I believe it's true so we don't want to take none of it out do we we don't want to take none of the message of the hour out how can we have hope unless we believe all of it we believe what he said we may not understand it we may not be able to fit this with this and that with that but we let it go we realize that if he's a word Prophet it's got to come from the scripture so there's something there maybe we don't understand but we say Lord give me an understanding because I know it's a promise of your word and it must be true right so we don't question those things we just believe God we believe his word and we believe that this is what Paul wrote now he said the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of the Archangel with the trumpet of God the dead in Christ shall rise first he said then we which are alive and remain should be caught up together with them in the cloud CLS remember brother brand explains that he said Cloud wave after wave of his glory to meet the Lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the Lord Brother brand said we watch the order of the Resurrection the first thing we get together not until we get together will we go together to meet him mothers and fathers will meet one another children and loved ones will meet one another then be caught up in the air to meet the Lord I know there's a doctrine of brother brandham is going to come back in a private pre- Resurrection Resurrection but that's not what brother brandham taught us right he didn't teach us that he said I'll come up with my generation right right and he'll come to his loved ones and we'll come with our loved ones and then we'll all be caught up together but at the time that we come up we don't have to worry about hearing any more Doctrine I know there people don't want to hear Doctrine today I still need doctrine because I haven't been changed right I still need to hear the word word because I still need there something God's conditioning inside of me but there will come a day I don't need to hear no more Doctrine when is that the moment I'm changed that' be the last time I ever need to go to church now we'll get together and worship but that's not now I need to go to church why I want to change I want to get better but then I'll be changed glory to God and so there'll come a day we don't need preachers no more but until we do let's keep preaching let's keep doing what God called us to do there'll come a day we don't need it but there there's a time now when we need to be conditioned for the Rapture he said then we stand there singing Redemption ssongs and angels with a circle around the earth will stand with bowed heads not knowing what they're talking about they never was lost they don't know what it means to be lost and to be found but Lord we know what it means I once was lost but now I'm found what blind but now I see you may not believe in dancing or shouting but I'll tell what you will then because you'll know what it's like to come all the way from what you were if a worm could become human I'm sure he'd be excited about it because in his condition as a worm he don't even he can't even grasp the concept of what it was to be human and in our condition of these bodies we don't even grasp the concept of what it's like to be in that new glorious body but it'll be there it's real friends it's real we need to do everything we can to condition ourselves to be there how can we do that only by the blood by the grace of God by the word that he's provided hallelujah hallelujah I got to slow down listen and some of y'all thinking no speed up speed up I want to get through this he said they never was lost they don't know but I was lost so I can sing he said then remember if we go before he comes we will be up and in his presence or raised before the others are changed the trumpet of the Lord shall sound the dead in Christ shall rise first he said then we which alive and remain shall be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye and be caught up together with them to meet the Lord in the air look at the order of the Resurrection see God knows that we long to see our loved ones amen look at that God knows that and if we go got there to meet him first we'd be looking around to see if mom or dad and the rest of them was there right I thought of your dad and you raise your hand back there brother Bobby used to sit here in the church we're going to see him one of these days but see if you went straight to see Jesus you you'd wonder if he made it are you with me and we believe brother Bobby's there but we but what does he do he lets you see him first glory to God it's a reality Church you know we need to inform ourselves of this see this believing this doesn't produce dryed religion doesn't produce dead cold formal religion but it produces a Living Hope a lively hope we've been resurrected in our souls and we're looking for resurrection of the body I love the old songs cuz many of the old songs were about heaven and they talked about heaven because the people had it so rough and now we live in a world where all we deal with is our complexes you know we talk about how we've been hurt and how this and that's happening I'm not trying to minimize that but I long for the day we can get back to realizing there's a better place and yeah we've been hurt but there's a place where we'll never be hurt again and yeah we've been through some things but there's a place where we'll never go through that again there's a place where there's none of that never be a misunderstanding never be a fight around the table now come on Church y'all human y'all just came through Thanksgiving too but there is coming a day you'll be able to get along with people because you'll be changed and they'll be changed glory to God he said but see how the holy spirit in his wisdom we meet one another first and then when we get there and sing amaz aming Grace that's when there's going to be a time of worship Hallelujah no wonder he said right before he preached the seals he was he was he was uh he was dedicating the new Tabernacle and he stood there and he said he said let's worship him here as if we were already there amen oh that's what I strive that's what we want to do that's what we want our worship to be like he said that's when there's going to be a time of worship he said you think I act funny now watch me up there it's going to be a wonderful time for me and all of us when we get there amen hallelujah brother BR said there's something in it that you feel on the inside of you your emotions pulsating now church I know it's not about emotions but listen to me emotions can be wrong you realize that if you were a business that there are counterfeit $100 bills how many knows that I don't have a $100 bill or I'd show you if somebody wants to give me one I'll show it to you but if you had a $100 bill like you don't you got one in your pocket don't you if you had a $100 if you had a $100 bill and and you you you're standing there and as a business say well I know they counterfeit these so I just quit taking them well if you don't have a $100 bills you don't have a business right right so what do you do you learn to discern between the true and the false there bad there are bad emotions there are emotions that'll Lead You astray there are things about your five senses you can't go go by that right we go by the word right but there are emotions that we feel that are real there are there are pulsation there things that God influences us we feel and it's real When what when is it real when it lines up with the word if it's right with the word it's real right are you with me now so brother random tells us there's something in it that you feel on the inside of you your emotions pulsating knows that the kingdom of God is near at hand what is it it's that subconsciousness that of you you've been taught the word and you see the condition that the world's in and you see how you have to struggle every day and there's just something inside of you when you hear a sermon about the Rapture you hear about the coming of the Lord just something pulsates inside of you your emotions what is that is that all these things that we've talked about and wondered about is now fixing to take place he said some of us may fall asleep before that time comes but that will not prevent our Resurrection because it gives the privilege of coming before those changed the trumpet of God shall sound the dead and crash your rise first then we which are alive and remain he said did you notice the order of the Resurrection shall be caught up together with them we meet each other before we meet him be caught up together to meet them with them to meet the Lord in the air he said see he's God and then when he wants to be worshiped that's what his very nature is is to be worshiped because he's God and he knows if we were there now think about it for a minute he said Look by he by looking we'd be looking out of the corner of your eye to see if the other one is there now how does he know that about us cuz we do it here we're always looking to see what the other one's doing and if we got there without seeing our loved ones we'd be worshiping him but we'd be looking out the corner of our attention would be divided I want to know if Joe made it I want to know if Allen made it I want to know are you with me we our tension would be divided oh Church but he said he wants all of our worship he said see if the other one's there but then it wouldn't be the complete way of free worship when we stand there and we know we've met each other first and greeted each other and then to stand by him who caused it all amen and sing the songs of what will that be our worship will be free because we won't be sitting there wondering oh did this one make it did that one we'll know oh Church we'll know we'll have met them and we'll know and we'll go on in now brother bam has asked the question if the bride will all be in one place before the Rapture and church I know we get to hear things and people will tell you and it's been something we fought we are not a farm team for any other church that's right God we can raise up kids and keep them around I know jobs are hard and stuff but we might as well have church here and we might as well raise up a church there's plenty of people people in this area that believe the message and people that love God we we can have church we don't need to take a backseat to nobody and you'll have people come around and and and say well you need to go to this place or go to that place the the Revival's happening over here you want Revival get on your knees and start asking God for it and God Revival is starting you and go to somewhere somebody else but you don't have to sit there and and listen be battered by all this stuff and say well you know if you're over here go to our church and hear our pastor then you're going to make it no you're going to make it by the grace of God when you get there you're going to sing Amazing Grace how sweet to sound you will not make a Rapture cuz you heard me preach you'll make a Rapture because the message of the hour came which was a shout which was himself Christ descending in our age glory to God and the message called you and if I preach the message you'll hear from me if I don't preach the message God will take me out of the way and somebody else will preach it you bloom where God planted you and that is you know if if you want to go somewhere else you get fed better somewhere else God's feed I I I want you to get fed I want you to make it I'm not holding on to nobody but I'll say this I want to I want to live for God with all of my heart I I want to I want to love him with all of my heart I want to go I want to go not just with our church but I want every church I want people from every Church to go I know not everybody's going to make it but I want as many to make it as can make it so I'm not going to burn no Bridges I'm not going to cut nobody off huh cuz I want them to be saved I want them to make it that means more than any temporary discomfort that I might have are you with me now we want you to make it so he said if no they said will it be in one place and will it be in the west that's kind of a leading question isn't it and brother BR said no he said now the first thing happens when we're resurrected the ones which are living will just still remain the Resurrection will set in first the resurrection of those that are asleep there will be Awakening time and those which are asleep in the dust now not those that are asleep in sin cuz they sleep right on he said they don't wake for another thousand years that's at the white Throne judgment but those who are sleeping in the dust will be awakened first and these corruptible bodies will put on incorruption in the rapturing grace of the Lord and then we'll all get together and when they begin to get together then we which are livive and remain should be changed these mortal bodies will not see death but just of a sudden now we're going to get to it in a minute but you say what will I be doing brother Ben I don't know you might be sleeping but you'll be awakened you might be doing the dishes but something will happen you might be sitting in church right I don't know where you'll be you might be in jail for the for the gospel's sake obviously could the resurrection happen in a jail absolutely it could happen in a jail I never forget I've told you before there's a lady one time years ago you know we all were kind of legalists we we were come on it's all right a lot of us didn't understand Grace and lady told my mom one time we told her we'd been to Silver Dollar City and she said well what would happen if the Lord come and you were on a roller coaster I'd go up an old man and come down a young man I don't know what to say that right like that's what I'm going to that's what's going to be what what does it matter what you're doing I'll say this I think you'll be a Christian Living for the Lord but there there's all kinds of things and you say well brother Ben I'll get to a place where I don't make any mistakes well if you ever got to that place you'd already be raptured you would need a change right so you're not going to get up to a place you young people you're always going to make mistakes but you don't you learn from them you don't repeat them you don't go back and do it again learn from it move on do something different right but but you you don't you don't just keep repeating those things you want to learn from it but we're all going to make mistakes we're all going to have problems but but you say well I have sickness the the body will continue to get sick until in a moment in a twinkling of an eye Hallelujah you might catch a cold the devil put a virus on you and you're sitting there can you imagine oh I couldn't go like that you absolutely could you could I'm letting my imagination run away with me now but anyway you could be sitting there with the with the thing going in the room one a humidifier one corner and a dehumidifier in the other corner and Vick all over you and just gasping for breath and in a moment boy I feel better I tell you what that vix must have worked never did before all of the sudden I'm changed Oh my he said Hallelujah these mortal bodies will not see death but just of a sudden there'll be like a sweep go over us and you're changed you're turned back like Abraham was oh my from an old man to a young man from an old woman to a young woman what's this Sudden Change and after a while you're traveling like a thought and all and your loved ones will be as close as your thoughts Church Hallelujah some of y'all been through some things I know you haven't I'm not trying to play on your emotions tonight but I believe it I believe it's real you've lost some loved ones and some of y'all lost sister CLE lost I think five children six children six children sister cth has lost and you're not supposed to your children aren't supposed to go before you but one of these days they'll be as close as a thought right he said well brother Ben what if they all didn't make it you believe that they all made it don't ever put that thought in your mind that they didn't make it that they some no you believe that they made it what good does it do to you believe negative thoughts in a moment God gave me my children that's it Hallelujah we travel see I might not be thinking about your children but you'll be thinking about them you travel like a thought you can see those V which are already resurrected oh what an hour then we'll gather with them and then be caught up with them to meet the Lord in the air Hallelujah listen Luke 17:34 tells it like this I tell you in that night there shall be two two men in one bed one should be taken the other should be left so there's someone sleeping two women should be grinding together so there's someone awake on the other side of the earth one should be taken and the other left two men shall be in the field the one should be taken and the other left you say but brother Ben what did Brother Bran mean by 6:00 to 9: in the morning we've explained the watch and all of those things to you but I'll say this I'm going to ask him when I get there I probably won won't even think about it to be honest with you but you say what does that mean now there's something about that I don't know brother BR said he believed the Rapture would take place between 6 and 9 o'clock in the morning but he based that on the Third Watch in the scripture the fourth watch and so but look there'll it'll happen all across the Earth at the same time right so two men will be in the field one should be taken the other left they answered and said to him where Lord and he said to them wheresoever the body is there will the Eagles be gathered together now brother B said it was a light and dark side of the earth and and he taught us there won't be a huge group go I had so many more quotes I had to take out of this just so we don't hear all night but there but there won't be a huge group go listen if half the Earth disappears somebody's going to notice right and when this happens people don't notice 2 Thessalonians 2:3 says let no man deceive you by any means for that day shall not come except they're come of Falling Away first right the majority is going to fall away and I don't say that of our church we're not a big church we're not the majority we're very much in the minority there might be thousands go I don't know brother brandham said in one place there' be a tithing of the earth another place he said a tithing of Christians I don't know how many it'll be one place he says 500 another place he says a thousand but it won't be many by population standards you understand but he said what we need to say is if there's one going in Hardy Arkansas so let me be that one but there will come a great Falling Away first in Mark 13:20 he said except that the Lord had shortened those days no flesh should be saved but for the elect's sake whom he hath chosen he has shortened the days oh my see if if if 500 people say or a thousand people go missing no one will notice everything will be as common as can be just another day brother BR said just speaks and the Rapture will come now I think if you really understand the the the Rapture everybody's always talk him me say well there's going to come a squeeze on the bride first you're not feeling it huh you it's not hard for you to go to church it is for everybody else now come on church I know some of you look forward to church I'm not talking about that but Satan will put something in your way brother brandom said the squeeze if you go back to if you go back to uh when brother Brandon preached Feast of the trumpets he said that squeeze he said would be he talked about the squeeze he talked about those 200 million demons that would be released he said that would be calling all these little loose ends as though if though they didn't matter don't matter if I go to church it don't matter if I serve God we're living in that time Church the Bible said they'd be rich and increased with Goods give buying and building building houses planting Vineyards marrying and giving in marriage right and they won't even know that it happened happen God just speaks and the Rapture will come it ain't going out there and the angels come down shovel up the graves get out an old dead carcass here what is it it was born of sin to begin with but a new one made in its likeness he said see if we have this we'll die again see you can say well God bring back my body to me but you it'd be the same old body and you'd die again he said nobody you say the graves will open the dead will walk out that may be true but not open the way you say open he said that TR won't be like that it'll be a secret because he said he'd come like a thief in the night he's already told us this the rapture he said then judgments will strike sin plague sickness and everything and people will cry for death to take them when the Judgment Lord why is this judgment upon us when you said there would be a Rapture first he'll say it's already come and you didn't know it see so wouldn't that stuff all happens but it happens after we're gone it's already come you didn't know it God hiding himself in Simplicity oh my all right he said that's all that's already happened and you knew it not he said why don't Believers believe how many Believers we got here tonight why don't believe believe the simple signs of his coming they're expecting all these things to spoke up of the scripture and the moon is going to go down the the sun in the middle of the day there's going to be all kinds of things he said I got the notes wrote here on it to show what them things are and we'll get get to it on the breaking of these seals this week anyhow he said see there it is just where it's already passed and you didn't know it see if it is he said if the angel of the Lord will break them seals forth to it remember it's seal with them seven mysterious Thunders he said now what why can't people believe the simple Simplicity of a humble bunch of people see and the voice of the signs of God why can't they believe it I think that same question is valid tonight I think we need to simplify a little bit why can't we believe the simple voice say we're going home the next thing to happen is the coming of the Lord he said just like it's always been a true word of God being made manifest that they're too smart too educated to believe the simple form of the written word and want to put their own interpretation to it it don't mean this it don't mean that see it does mean that even the visions that God gives us here at the place it's so misunderstood that's the reason you hear on the tape say say what the tape say say what the Visions say he said now if you're Wide Awake you'll see something see I hope I don't have to hold it in my hand and show you he said you're it's here we're at the end yes sir smart educationals miss it the simple Visions when they revealed and sent such Simplicity till it just covers over the top of people's heads and he talks about the hunting Vision that he had and he goes back talks you know people there are still people who believe brother the Brown's got to come back and kill a brown bear that poor bear my goodness huh he don't have to die let the Bear live why because brother B explained that to us what happened you remember he said I was he said the vision went by just exactly he said but I wasn't in the right place right but he said we're at the end that was to show us something church he was showing us something we got to be in the right place yes sir where do we need to be brother being in Christ in the word but he said smart educationals miss it the simple Visions when there revealed such Simplicity it covers over the top of people's heads he talked about his mother and how she died and all those things and he said yet John came right out there and confessed he said I'm not no Messiah but I'm the voice of one crying in the wilderness and them very disciples say why does the scripture say the scripture teach that Elias must first come he said the Simplicity of God just Roots right over the top of people's head let me tell you today if you don't believe it Elijah has come and he's already done what he was supposed to do and the Mysteries have been open the books been open and the Revelation has come and it's time to get ready [Applause] church let me help you get ready if I can't help you get ready find somebody who can let's get ready first Thessalonians 5:1 but of the times and Seasons Brethren you have no need that I Rite unto you for yourselves know perfectly the day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night for when they shall say peace and safety then sudden destruction cometh upon them as travail upon a woman with child they shall not Escape but ye Brethren are not in darkness that that day should overtake you as a thief it's going to overtake the world as a thief they're going to think things are going in the right direction the polls are going to say everything's going right everybody's going to be happy with the president first time ever I don't know that that'll happen but anyway miracles do happen but everybody's going to be just going along it's going to just look like things are going good oh my but you're not the children of Darkness you're the children of light the children of the day we are not of the night nor of Darkness therefore let us not sleep as do others let us watch and be sober amen the BR said we see it's pointing every mile post everything every needle every Compass is set straight onto his coming we're at the end there's nothing else that I know someone say nothing else nothing else that I know oh my to happen but the coming of the Lord again he said there's not a thing left my Christian friend but the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ that's the only hope that the church has the only hope listen church I'm not going to be able to fix everything that's wrong with you you're not no other preacher is going to be able to either I can't fix everything that's wrong with me what's going to happen it's going to take a body change it's going to take rapturing [Applause] Grace Hallelujah he said can't you see Spirit-filled people something is fixing to happen don't look for some great big Universal something sweeping nothing but the coming of the Lord Jesus remember he says musicians go ahead and come I'm done remember just remember the words and the promise of the Lord what did he say he'll descend with a shout brother Bram told us Christ does all three as he comes where are we at church do we realize what that means the next thing is the resurrection that's it we talked this morning about how God you were the thoughts of God could you grab a hold of that thought is that something that you can you can grab it's hard for me we were in a created thought of God other words it wasn't a thought that just God happened to have a thought but it's a created thought right he he chose to think it right he chose to make brother Logan brother Logan he chose that he that was his thought and you were expressed but when you come to the Earth you come in a body of sin right all of us did we come in a body of sin but one day the light come by your path you were headed One Direction suddenly you started heading in another Direction brother B said look what you were look what you are now something made something changed you something made you different say well I'm not the shoust person in the world I'm not the one that runs the aisles all the time I think God could do that for you but that's not what it's about look what you were look what God Made You right one day the the word just come by your way and when it come by your way what happened you begin to change inside you begin to change but the old body was still the same and and the memories some of the memories that you have are still the same you still remember you still remember and and the complexes and things maybe that you had maybe the even the complexes from a child and things you still had them but the holy spirit's working in your life he's changing you as you as you take captive every thought to The Obedience of Christ he's changing you what's happening what's God doing that thought that he had he's bringing you the seed the real you back to that thought it's the process of redemption and then what's he doing for you he's going to take you back oh Church he's taking you back inside and one day he's going to take you back on the outside you said but brother Ben what if I'm not you know I'll never be perfect that's true but his grace makes up for all the rest are you with me now it takes rapturing Grace at the end of the day it takes rapturing Grace but God had a picture of you Brother Band taught us that he had a picture of you when you were healthy and strong minus all the defects think about that that for a minute most of my defects you know I have defects I'm too fat and I was preaching in Louisiana and some girl down there her boyfriend was in another state you know and he wrote I'll tell you who it is if you ask me I'm not going to say it across here because he's probably listening he was in another state and he said he said she sent him a picture and I saw the picture she all she got out of the sermon that I preached is it said I'm
