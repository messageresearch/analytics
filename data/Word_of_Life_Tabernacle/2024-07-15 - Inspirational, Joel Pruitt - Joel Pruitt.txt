amen how many's happy to be in the house of the Lord tonight amen man if you're all in different spots you're a lot closer than you were this morning and uh that's a good thing we leave it like that couldn't we if you have your Bibles let's turn to 1 Timothy chapter 6 and verse 12 1 Timothy chapter 6 and verse 12 if I could title this tonight our journey to freedom and I'd like to focus mostly on our our older youth but you younger ones I tell you what uh there'll be something in here for you I promise especially if you say Amen every once in a while and pull on me a little bit I I need it tonight for sure 1 Timothy 6:12 fight the good fight of Faith lay hold on eternal life whereinto Thou Art also called and Hast professed a good profession before many witnesses and if you'll turn over to Joshua chapter 1 and verse 4 Joshua chapter 1 and verse4 say Amen when you get it Joshua 1 and4 somebody said amen we'll go for that from the Wilderness and this Lebanon even unto the Great River the river Euphrates all the land of the Hittites and under the great sea toward the going down of the sun shall be your Coast there shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life as I was with Moses so I will be with thee I will not fail thee nor forsake thee can somebody say Amen to that in verse six is where I want to kind of stay at tonight for a little bit be strong and of a good courage For unto this people shalt thou divide for inheritance to land which I swear unto their fathers to give them and verse 7even it's one of my favorites only be thou strong and very courageous that thou mayest observe to do according to all the law which Moses my servant commanded thee turn not from it to the right hand or to the left that thou mayest Prosper withs soever thou goest you may be you may be seated tonight may the Lord add His blessings to the word and we have a journey to freedom but on this journey see if I can see these boys over here on this journey to Freedom there's going to be a fight can you say Amen there I don't believe there's I don't believe you can ever get to your goal uh without fighting for it and the reason is because we are fighting uh we are fighting an enemy a common enemy a common enemy that we all know well and if we look in the scriptures we'll see that we're not the only generation that has fought this same battle uh we I I tell you if you go back all the way to Moses's day you'll find that they had to fight for every inch of ground that they possessed can you say Amen everything that they needed on that Journey on their Journey to the promise on their journey to Freedom there would be a battle after battle there would be enemy after enemy every everything would come against them and when I believe on our way to the message of the hour and to full Revelation in this day you will fight with with everything you've got to attain what God has for you today the devil doesn't want you to be in this message the devil doesn't want you to know what a prophet taught in this day the devil does not want you to be happy in church can you say Amen the devil doesn't want you to know what a prophet said is truth he doesn't want you to follow after a Moses he doesn't want you to follow after a man named William Brandon why because they are Vindicated prophets and the devil hates the word and the devil hates the word of God and he hates the messenger that would bring it but if you go all the way back to where Moses is going into Egypt remember he could go down there and he could show the signs he could show the signs that God had told him he could you know he could call for the frogs and he could call for the fleas and he could call for all these things and yet the unbelievers could sit there and never one time would they come around and say well you know what that's a man of God no because an unbeliever is just an unbeliever can you say am man an unbeliever will never believe but listen there was a group of people sitting over there in the mud pits well come on somebody there's a group of people sitting over there that didn't look like much they didn't they didn't live in the palace and they didn't they didn't have the fancy chariots and maybe they didn't have the most money in the land but they were the people chosen to follow the message of the hour can you say amen God had already called these people for such a time as this and he had raised up a man on the back side of the desert and he knew his people needed delivered I tell you there was a message of Deliverance that came down that day and I believe today for you young people there is a message of Deliverance here if you could just reach out and grab a hold of it today why because God has sent a message in the season that it needed to come in to call out a young people that if you didn't have this message there would be no overcoming Leota you had to have something Supernatural in this day in order to come out all the older people can say Amen too you would have been just another Baptist or just another Methodist or just another Pentecostal but God has sent you a messenger and he said come out of Egypt come out of her my people and you you don't have to be partakers of those plagues can you say Amen we're not here to partake of what the world has well I I I tell you I feel like preaching to you for a minute we are we are more than able to take the land but we got to get out of Egypt first and I'll tell you on the way out of Egypt oh Supernatural you see Supernatural and you see the blood being applied and the token is applied and you think well this is going to be easy going this is going to be good because we're follow I'm with him we're following him and and and nothing can stop us well I tell you what well here's the problem the devil's still going to find you and he's still going to try to get you and so on your journey out of Egypt the devil don't even want to get you don't even want you to get out of Egypt but then when you get down to the to the Red Sea and and you you start to fear well well what about that good camp meeting I just come out of and and all those good feelings I just had well what happened to those well it they all left when Pharaoh's Army started showing up yeah they all left why because they're I than for the amen sign amen they you know listen they felt good when Moses brought them out they felt pretty good when when my kids are are you know they're they're saved under the blood they're under the token oh we got faith now but what about when Pharaoh's Army shows up what about when the devil fights you on Monday morning can you still remember there was a prophet that came with a message to pull you out of your condition well can you say man God sent a message and it was listen if he brought you out of Egypt he'll take you all the way to the promised land he's not going to leave you on this journey but he promised you a way of Escape oh but when Pharaoh's Army shows up and they they they show up and and the next thing you know well listen there they are and and can you imagine the scared looks on everybody's faces can you imagine everybody there is scared everybody there is like well well we just come out here to die in the wilderness and they told Moses we should have stayed there and Moses Steed the people and he stretched forth that rod and it had already been turned into a snake before but some of them people had forgot what God had already done for him I wonder if our young people have forgotten what God did for you just a few more short months ago hey well come on somebody that God has delivered you from demons God has delivered you from things that were in your life God has filled you with the Holy Ghost don't let the devil tell you I just want to go back like I was there's no tur it back now you've already come too far you already you've already come out of Egypt but you fighting another devil well come on somebody just because you had a good experience one time don't doubt the experience but remember remember the devil is going to show up again and again and you're I tell you what it's not just a Revival from one meeting to the next but I will say this it's good to have those experiences not just one time in your life but it a there's nothing wrong with having another experience when the Lord moves on the scene and you start seeing well I tell you what you can see a a Milky presentence sometimes over the congregation during a meeting because why the faith is high that's the time to step into the water that's the time to grab hold why well come on somebody it's not fanaticism to go down and get another experience at an altar that's not doubting what you got the first time I believe you got the Holy Ghost but you need a refilling tonight what you need tonight is to go back to where you got the the filling in the first place if it was in an altar if it was in a prayer closet wherever it was I say tonight you need to get back in tune with God again oh young people listen it ain't good enough to say well I had it I had it no hold on to what you got hold on to that and fight for it oh when you start feeling the atmosphere getting cold around you oh don't say well well I I I thought I had it no no no you still got the same thing you had at camp but you need to let that Revival be Reviving you again let that Revival start back up in you again and I'll tell you what the way to do it is quit looking at the doubters quit looking at the Red Sea and remember I'm with him I'm with a Vindicated Prophet I'm with a message that can well come on somebody I'm still in this thing to win it I'm in it to go all the way to the promised land I didn't come this far just to be lost in the desert I didn't come this far just to be just to be killed by Pharaoh's Army but I've come this far because I know that I know that the message of the hour is true and I know that I'm following a Vindicated Prophet the same Pillar of Fire that was there is the same Pillar of Fire that is leading the church today can you say Amen we don't have any reason to fear we don't have to worry about Pharaoh's Army I tell you when that army of demons comes against you God will raise up a standard and I believe God has raised up a standard in this hour well somebody ought to say Amen somebody ought to say this is my inheritance and I've comeing I I tell you what I'm not going to stay in Egypt I'm not satisfied with Egypt I'm not satisfied with just the journey but I know what's at the end of the journey and I will keep pressing on gy to God brother Rand would say it like this he said look I'll give it to you the land's over there but before you get there you got to fight can you say Amen before you get there you got to fight that's what's the matter with people today they're afraid to stand and fight what we need is I must fight if I should Reign increase my courage Lord he said must I be carried home to heaven on a flower bed of ease While others fought to win the prize he said no sir I must fight if I must reain he said oh we're so wishy-washy boneless and helpless spineless as worms Oh come on somebody that's what a prophet said why because we so easily want to give up when there's a CH in our way we so easily want to give up when it looks like we've got a little backsliding in our lives well the thing to do is not give up when you backslide but come back to God when you backslide well I got cold I don't I tell you what that that that emot that feeling left me I'm not against emotion I believe in EM I believe every Christian in here should have some emotion because if that religion is not causing emotion brother R said bury it well can you say amen that's what we need we need to know that there is a living God Among Us and we need to feel him because I think that's the time when he comes down and he starts he lets you know that he loves you I tell you what when you feel that belt going across your backside you know your parents love you right I can't get an name out of no none of them I tell you what but that you know that your parents love you when you do that and sometimes when you can feel God coming down in a meeting sometimes it ain't always pretty maybe it's in a corrective way but if you can just take what he's got for you then what he's trying to do is say listen I know what you've come out of I know where you've been but this is where you need to go I I'm not trying to be mean and I'm trying to wake you up a little bit I'm trying to find something to say but listen I tell you what some of you young people you're going to fight battles some of these young ones don't even know yet some of you teenagers have experienced it you know how the devil can get a hold of you you know how the devil can make you doubt your experience you know how the devil can tell you well I I thought I had the Holy Ghost but I don't have it yes you do quit giving ear to the devil quit letting the devil tell you who you are and start looking to the promise of God if you're on the journey with the messenger of the hour I say stay on the journey there there might be a time when you need water don't worry the water will come there might be a time when you need bread and you need something to eat there'll be something come from Heaven that'll feed your soul well come on somebody well just when they thought they're going to starve half to death here we are in the middle of a desert and God would send down His blessings and sending something to eat oh listen to me church God is not going to leave you alone but he has sent his comforter to give you the Holy Ghost and so you could be called out of Egypt but you didn't you didn't come out just to stay out but you come out so that you can go into something there's a coming out but there's a going in and going in today what is going to lead us in now if you'll notice Moses stayed on one side but on the other side Joshua took him over now brother Brandon would say and you young people listen to this your Holy Ghost today is the Joshua today is the holy ghost so we may not have a physical Joshua among us but the Holy Ghost uses men and the Holy Ghost uses leadership in your lives because the Joshua is the Holy Ghost so when Moses had to leave the scene well come on somebody I'm G preach to you for a minute when when the prophet had to leave the scene when the prophet may not have went over but yet he left the Holy Ghost so that listen brother brandom's not going to be here to tell you everything to do brother bram's not going to be here to tell you how to dress and how to live and how to act but there is a Holy Ghost GH that you can get a hold of and that Holy Ghost will lead you into the promises of God the Holy Ghost will take you where you need to go I'll tell you I about lost my voice but I'm going to preach anyway God has given you the Holy Ghost don't let the devil tell you you don't have it you know when the devil's telling you you don't have it that's a good sign you got it because every time he opens his mouth he's lying to you so you say well I had it but but but but but no no that's the devil talking to you because anytime there is doubt comes in your mind about something like that I'm telling you that's the devil speaking now God will deal with your heart but not in that way God's not going to be like well maybe that no listen that's not how God works with you God will draw you unto him God will draw you to the Holy Ghost God will draw you to an altar but the devil will make you sit in that seat in doubt right see God won't let you sit there in doubt God will draw you right back to him but the devil will cause you to sit there and doubt time after Ser service after service meeting after meeting well I I I just can't get it yes you can I don't care what you've done I don't care how bad you've been I don't care how low down you fell God knows your need and he's here to supply that need tonight I say in these meetings you ought to come to these services and if God should slay you in the spirit I say let him slay you in the spirit let's quit sitting in the seat of the scornful you know a prophet one time would sit in the seat of the scornful and in the seat of the scornful he would laugh and make fun of the people that were dancing in the aisles but one time he said he said he's sitting there thinking what that's crazy bunch and he said next thing you know the Holy Spirit got a him I I got a hold of him and next thing you know he was dancing in the aisles so be careful if you start laughing at people that are dancing I'm going to tell you this when Miriam and them got across the Red Sea when they got to the other side they got so happy that they had defeated some Giants and they had defeated Pharaoh's Army listen to me Church she couldn't help but play that tambourine and do a little bit of happy dance why because God had brought him through something and God today if he delivers you from something you can't help but praise him you can't help the shout a little bit how can I tell you what you hold your peace and the rocks are going to cry out but I say there's some young people today I challenge you don't let the rocks cry in your place I said don't let them have to cry out let us be the ones who praise God because he is worthy of Our Praise thank you Lord Brother BR talks about old buddy Robinson he said he got down in the corn field and said Lord if you don't give me the Holy Ghost when you come back to earth you're going to find a pile of bones laying here why because he got serious with God he wasn't just playing Church no more but he knew that I've got to have the Holy Ghost because that's what's going to take you into the land of promise brother Bram said but look at here what will my church say what will my pastor say what will this say what will my mama say what will this say it don't matter well come on somebody it don't matter what they say it don't matter what your friends say it don't matter matter what why because they're not the ones that have the final say but God has the final say can you say amen he said he said God said utterly destroy that thing amen he said what we need today he said you're baby and around with a whole lot of things you ought to be destroying well you young people better say Amen to that your baby and those demons that are trying to take you out I say it's time to let those demons go I say let them go because you can't take them in with you to the promised land we're going on a journey but we've got to get rid of some things and we've got to fight some devils and it's you're never going to get there if you give up you'll die in the wilderness but there's a group of people oh I hope you hear me now there's a group of young people that are already ready to fight why because they've been equipped with the armor they've been equipped with the sword of the word they know who they are you are more than conquerors young people I tell you what God is raising up an army well I wish some of you adults would get behind me for a minute and let me tell you something God is Raising you up for such a time as this God has chosen you sister Stephanie he wouldn't leave you out there in the world because he knows somebody has to make a Rapture and he already had your name on the book he already knew who was going in he already knew who wouldn't be afraid of those those giants in the land he knew somebody has to carry the grapes somebody is going to be ready to take take their land why because God has chosen you God needed somebody and it might as well be you it might as well be me God don't want young people to sit there have four to in his service he wants some young people that'll shout and say amen I tell you what we're not looking for another cold dead church but we're looking for a church on fire we're looking for a church that can say I don't care what my mama did I don't care what my daddy did I don't care what my ancestor did we're breaking generational cycles and curses here tonight I don't care what your family was God has called you for such a time as this because you're not afraid of the Giants you're not afraid of what's in the land because you know in that land there may be Giants there may be fighting there may be all kinds of things that'll come against you but in that land is blessing in that land is healing in oh come on somebody in this message is everything you have need of to make a Rapture everything everything don't give up when the Giants come after you you young people are going to fight demons today and tomorrow and the next day I know he is how do we know the devil's going to come after our young people because he hates he hates this group of young people that's right he's not going to work on the people out there in the world they're already following him well can you say amen he don't he don't care he don't care what they do they're out there cussing and drinking and smoking and well come on boys are dressing like girls girls are dressing like boys the devil don't care what they do but he cares about you and he don't want you to make it into the land because he knows he can't be defeated but he don't wants you to be winners either either the devil knows I'll never achieve this I I I'll never make the land I can never be saved I've already been cast down but he don't want you to make it but let me tell you something young people every time you fight that devil you've got to go back at him with the word and say it is written it is written brother Brandon would say it like this he said Jesus could have defeated Satan and cast him down but he actually gave us a blueprint for the weakest of Christians can you say Amen he said he gave us something for the weakest of Christians because Jesus could have just cast Satan down but he said it is written because he wanted to show you that's all you have to say is it is written all you have to say is I'm not going to fall for that trap of the devil again all you have to say well come on somebody I tell you what if there's a boy that's not in church and you young girls are trying to go after him I say stay away from him because it is written don't yoke yourself up with unbelievers well come on somebody you young boys don't don't be looking after these Hollywood girls don't be looking after these girls that are half dressed why because that's nothing but heartbreak for you that's nothing but just a Time listen it's it's pleasure for a season and the end of end thereof is death it's nothing but to take you right out of the land but let me tell you something get so in tune with God that you're not worried about your boyfriend you're not worried about your girlfriend you're not worried about the relationships until it's you and God that's fixed first what relationships really matter anyway I'm just being us with you tonight you young people you may you know we get in the meetings and you there's all these you know if you're a boy I remember I remember when I was a boy and I go to these meetings brother the Ben's over here trying to hide from me but he can't he sit on them hard chairs and uh he's getting tired already but I've got 10 minutes left let me tell you something you get in these meetings and these pretty girls show up and they always dress better at meetings than they do at their home church just so you know because they dress up cuz they know there's going to be all these little boys and and boys do too they'll you know they'll dress to the nine for a meeting and the regular Services you know they're mismatched I know my I know my tie don't wear don't match my suit but uh it ain't meetings yet so I'll match them up for the meetings listen but it's the way it's nature it's nature but do you know the most important thing you can get out of this meeting is not a girlfriend or a boyfriend the most important thing you can get is my relationship with God right because you get that one right and God will take care of the rest you don't have to worry about who you're going to marry if you get this right let's get this right first and God will send you the right one when you're ready for the right one well come on somebody just because you're 17 18 19 years old doesn't mean you have to have a boyfriend it doesn't mean you have well come on somebody I'll just meddle a little bit brother Ben can get mad at me later listen we've let peer pressure interfere with the way we are in church because we think if so and so's got this then I need well come on somebody we need to let go the p pressure and say Lord what do you want for me what are what is your plan for my life because his plans will actually work out right in the end but if you go your own way and you don't consult god well come on somebody if you fail to consult God then God's not going to let you make it over into the promised land even his Prophet gets down there so far and he had to do things on his own he stood in the gap for the people and had to make decisions and he and he couldn't even go over because why well come on somebody I know that's hard to swall we say well Moses couldn't make it over but he had to intercede for the people and and he got out of the will of God he smoked the rock instead of speaking to the rock well that's just that's what happened that's what the Bible says but there is a generation who will just follow the message they're not going to look at the mistakes they're not going to look back and say well Moses couldn't make it are we well come on somebody it's not Moses they were following they were following a supernatural light and that light would lead them all the way from Egypt all the way to the promised land and it didn't stop there just because they crossed over there's going to be another people in today there's another people of the book there's another people that's called a Joshua generation why do we call them that because it's a holy ghost filled young people it's a holy ghost filled group and you have that Joshua on the inside of you that the Giants don't scare you oh come on somebody nothing scares you I I tell you what I was reading a quote to the brothers in the back there did you know did did you know that cancer is not any harder actually nervousness is harder to overcome than answer and what do you think the devil has attacked our young people with he's attacked their nerves he wants to get them in such a condition that they can't even get right for go with God in a church they can't even think of how to come to come to God in a service he wants to attack your nerves because listen that's the way the devil Works he wants to get on he wants to get on your last nerve he wants to grab a hold of you at your weakest point and he wants to keep you from your blessings that's right I'm just preaching to you no idea where I'm going or where I'm at but listen God has got a young people that are going to have to quit playing around and quit well come on somebody quit just getting an emotion here and an emotion there hold on to that experience hold fast to that which is good and don't you let up for no devil that's trying to tell you that what you got ain't that because what I saw well I'll tell you what what I witnessed in a young people's meeting over there in Oklahoma was some young people getting filled with the Holy Holy Ghost it was no emotion oh you can laugh at it you can make fun of it but I saw some young people who it it changed their lives but the devil's trying to attack him again I'm just preaching to you the devil's trying to come after again and trying to cool them off because the devil don't like you worshiping God the devil don't want you standing up for no preacher the devil don't want you getting on fire for God the devil don't want you singing Your Heart Out the Devil don't want you to love church but we don't care what the devil don't like we're going to have some meetings anyway and we're going to back the preacher when the preacher preaches and we're going to sing with all of our voices well come on somebody I say it's time we quit playing church and start letting God have the have the final say of what's good and what's bad I'm getting so sick and tired of the devil stealing the worship in our churches oh he deals with me that way too you say well brother Joel do you ever fight the devil yes I find him sitting there oh I don't want you to stand I don't want you to raise your hand I don't really want you to shout I'll tell you what I get I'm getting tired of that devil and we need some more people in this building to get tired of the devil who has bound you and take your Liberty in the land that's a devil that's a devil that's stealing your joy that's a devil that's stealing your peace that's a devil that's coming after you I say let it go tonight and worship God in the way that's called crazy worship God with all you got worship God in the house worship God wherever you are because God loves to be worshiped the devil hates it but we don't care we are not under submission to the devil we are Sons and Daughters of God we've been called from a land we've been called for such a time as this we are those who are going to go all the way oh I'm going to tell you right now there's a Rapture coming there's a Rapture coming and don't you miss it because a bunch of dead church members told you you couldn't move in the church don't you miss it because somebody said we we can't shout in church no more I say quit listening to the Devils I don't care if they stand In a Pulpit the devil can use good men but don't you listen to that devil that devil tells you that was just an emotion I say step on that devil's head I say tell that devil to go back where he come from he has no power over you somebody in this church ought to get with me for a minute because I'm GNA tell you something you some of you Elders have sat there and showed our young people how to not worship you say well the young people can have their Revival I don't need one oh I can tell you right now we all do I can tell you right now we need a Revival the very fact that you don't want a Revival tells me you need a Revival the very fact well he told me to just punch it hard and preach so I'm trying listen I ain't trying to get on to nobody for how you worship but you got to worship I don't care how you worship but I guarantee you I'll guarantee you when you sit there and you criticize other worshippers that's not worship that's right I know not everybody worships the same but worship however you worship with all you got right it ain't all screaming it ain't all running it ain't all speaking in tongues but worship God in the way that's called crazy well they don't call nobody crazy for sitting there like a bump on a pickle so that ain't the way to worship god well bless bless my heart I may not make it to the meetings I'm going to read a quote for you is that all right all great people great men every individual has a time where there's a decision time you got to say yes or no you young people this is important to you you got to say yes or no that may be there may be many in here tonight you got to say I will take Christ for my healer or I won't now that's listen you say Well that's for healing no that's for anything right you're going to take him at his word or you're not going to well can you say amen that's right I will take Christ or I won't he said think of it now the time of the promise Drew nigh and God Called Moses by a pillar of fire in the burning bush then God commissioned him and he said I will send the angel before thee to keep thee in the way to bring thee in the place which has been prepared which he's giving to them there's a place that's been prepared for you listen we're looking back too much we're looking at what was in Egypt quit looking at your problems and look at the promise Lord brother says like this he said I'll give you Palestine it's yours it's all fenced in with these hivites jebusites perizzites amorites it's all fenced in but I've give it to you oh come on somebody I don't care what kind of demons are over there looking at you in the face I've give you this land of promise I've let you have some freedom in church why because he knew you needed it in a time like this when do you realize what we're fighting in the age of Leota we're not fighting emotion we're fighing a cold formal indifferent lukewarm Church a lukewarm church maybe they're not cold he said I rather have a cold or hot listen he's fighting that Spirit he's not fighting a church on fire God's not fighting God didn't come out rebuking the church on fire he never rebuked the Church of Pentecost but he rebuked him for getting cold on him you say why would you preach such a way because that's what the Bible says I know Jesus sat down and taught them but I'll guarantee you them people were blessed that's right the Believers were the Believers were we never got we don't have any account what the congregation did they might have run the aisles use your imagination there I don't know I don't know where the aisles would have been in that situation but but listen we don't know what they did but I'm going to tell you this the word will move the believer the word will move the church listen the word will not move the unbeliever they'll sit there and look at you like you're crazy but this word ignites some something in the heart of the believer you can't stay quiet right there's nothing listen I'm almost out of time I give myself not enough time so anyway he said it's your possession it's all bound down with amorites and Canaanites and everything listen when you come to God is when the battle begins it was easy on the other side because it was just them and their own you know problems but then they get over there to the land where all the blessings are it's filled with giants that could destroy him that's right so when you young people actually get an experience with God is when the real fight began you say oh I want to I want to go back like I was three or four months ago no you don't because if if the devil wasn't fighting you then then he already had you but now that he's fighting you oh come on somebody I know our young people go through some things I talk to them I know what's going on with them I'm going to tell you something the devil's fighting you the devil don't want you to have victory in church no more the devil never you when you sat there quiet the devil never you when you didn't want to sing in church the devil never you when you wouldn't raise your hands brother trip the devil never fought you in that condition but now that you have found out that I can be free the devil's going to fight you with everything he's got and don't give in it's worth the fight the land is worth it this land is worth it young people everything that we have need of the blessings of God it's worth the fight it's worth it everything we have need of listen if you've got an addiction it's worth the fight to get over that he's given you the ability to fight it that may look too big for you to overcome but it's not too big nothing is impossible with you all that might have got you but brother brandham said he said I know that they say nothing is impossible with God he said but nothing is impossible with you either if you believe it that's a quote go look it up nothing is impossible with you young people because God has given you the ability to possess the land I tell you what if all you can do is start praying 10 more minutes a day take whatever you can get because every inch you possess is an inheritance for you everything you possess is an overcoming well come on somebody you'll never possess it going backwards you'll never possess it Running Scared you're never going to possess this land if you're running and you're scared to death of the devil the devil is nothing but a love those giants in the land were just scarecrows because when they went over there they realized the same God that brought me out of Egypt the same God that drowned Pharaoh's Army the same God that would provide water from a rock oh come on somebody the same God that was a rock in the weary of hand God that same God could take us over there to a walled City and let us March around it according to the word of God and every demon is going to fall down why because God said so we're letting the devil have his way we're letting the devil have all kinds of timeing in our minds and we're letting the devil have all kinds of time in the church service but I say let the devil go back where he come from and focus on the promise again and realize God said take the land and I'm going to take the land I don't care if there's a demon I got to fight I don't care well come on somebody I don't care what you got to fight God has giving you that land go possess it if God said you can have the Holy Ghost young ladies you can possess the Holy Ghost don't you wait on let's listen you don't have to wait till a meeting you can do it tonight if the Bible said to be baptized and you shall receive it I say the first step is get down to the business with God and repent of your sins and be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and then you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost and if you've been baptized don't you doubt that promise of the Holy Ghost because in this land this land of promise that Holy Ghost is yours in this land of promise everything you need is yours you say well I'm sick healing is yours I I don't have no joy no more joy is yours I tell you what I don't love church no more the love of God can come back in you why because it's yours you are in the land of promise can I tell you what it is the message of the hour this message is where all the promises lay everything you have need of is in this message for such a time as this it's spiritual food in It season oh yeah it's spiritual food for you young people see the devil don't want you to listen to tapes anymore you know why that's right because he don't want you to feed on the word stored up for today you know why he don't want you to come and listen to your pastor or why he come and listen to some little nit with preacher you know why he don't want you to because he knows that if you realize who you are if you can just recognize your freedom one time then he'll realize that that cord that he tied you with was cut the whole time and that he had no control over you and if you ever recognize that he knows he's losing his hold on you I tell you what young people you need to realize tonight he has no hold on you it's just a false Mirage that he's got some kind of a shelter over you and some kind of a Dark Cloud over you I say look up and say Lord deliver me from this evil he is more than willing to give you a refilling of the Holy Ghost tonight I say there's somebody I don't let these meetings come and go without getting your blessing don't let these meetings come and go and you sit back there and say well they were good meetings there were some good preaching and you know what there was some good PE there was people got saved oh but what about me do I need another walk with God I say for everybody in this building tonight you need to think about it am I really where I need to be on this journey to the promised land am I really letting go of the things I need to let go of bitterness is not crossing over right hate will never cross over your opinion I against the word will never cross over come on you got a promise wrapped in opinion you might as well throw that baby out with the bath water because listen your opinion is not going to take you to the promised land but we have a Vindicated message we have a message that come oh come on somebody we have a messenger Vindicated with the same pillar fire that led Moses down to Egypt and led the people out you realize what we've got when your friends tell you why can't you just be Baptist why can't you just do this do you realize we're not following just another another move this is the move of the hour this this is the time that you realize this is the fashion move yeah come on this is it come on this this is this is hip this is what we're supposed to be this is the cool thing right now for the Believers if you were in Moses's day and you were in that group you got to go into the promised land and you got to do really cool things you got to kill bad people I'm about done I got to get some of you to laugh at least once but this is the move the move is on but you need to be a part of it that goes not for just for our kids but that's every one of us in the building me and you and everybody in the back every one of us we need to be in tune with what God is doing in this hour because if you were not in the move that come out of Egypt and made it through the promised land listen if you weren't in that group if you were not in that move you were not going over come on I know that hurts some feelings because you say well what about my friends well listen let's claim them they're going to be there but what you need to do is worry about you and God am I ready to cross over do I have the faith to slay Giants you young people you've let the devil steal your joy for the last time why don't you just quit why don't you just quit letting the devil enter your life why don't you quit letting the devil tell you how bad you are when God already told you you're saved when God already told you hey here's the Holy Ghost it's yours why do you quit letting the devil beat you over the head why do we let why do we live so far below our privileges when God has given us a land full of joy and peace and the Holy Ghost well I tell you what somebody ought to tell somebody ought to tell God you know what I'm on the battlefield I'm ready to keep going I I I'm not giving up I'm not going to be out here in the desert and die without water because I know there's water prepared I'm not going to be out here well I tell you what we've let the devil have I'll tell you what in this service purpose in your heart the devil's done he's had his last say with me and when he comes at you tomorrow before he ever roosts in your mind kick that devil out and say you have no right over a child of God quit letting him Roost there you can't help the devil coming in your mind you can't help the devil showing up on Monday morning but you can defeat that Devil with the word of God oh I tell you what when you start feeling like the devil's got you brother JT I tell you what it's a good time to sit there and press play that's for my friends that think I'm think I'm crazy there's nothing wrong we've made a dirty word out of this right we we' we've said you can't have preachers but you can still press play you can still hear a Vindicated Prophet we are blessed when we were overseas and they had they had three messages in that language we realized how blessed we were we have it at our fingertips when that Devil's in that room with you and he's telling you you're not good enough and he tries to get into that mind and make you do something you know just ain't right go ahead and turn on a tape the devil hates being where God's presence is and I'll tell you what you can create an atmosphere when you listen to the message of the hour you can create an atmosphere when you get in your prayer closet and say you know what Lord here I am again and I tell you what he never gets tired of hearing from you I would say this he hasn't heard from us enough lately God wants to hear from his children God wants to hear when you're down God wants to hear when you're having a problem God wants to know you you need help God wants to know that why because you've let the devil have the time and you sit there and discuss deals with the devil and you forget you can go to God and he can solve every problem my time's up and I told him I wouldn't my time's over up actually can I read one more quote all right y all be okay you'll be okay you'll be okay now we're looking for somewhere there's no death no sorrow no heartaches no old age that land is somewhere and will never be able to achieve it by guns and fighting and so forth with a natural carnal weapon but there is a land that we can go to and it's a battle to get there when God gave Israel Palestine and when he was in Egypt they had to fight for every inch of it and he told Joshua and Joshua 1 he said wherever The Souls of your foot Treads upon that I have given you so Footprints means possession just keep walking walking pressing on and every time you make a step into the kingdom of God that's yours and all things are possible that's given and all things are given that's possible but it's a battle young people but it's a battle God has given you this land if you had a blessing at camp hold on to that blessing that was a possession that you needed but there's another blessing coming and grab a hold of every one of them there's listen God's not going to run out of blessings to give you I say take everything that God's got because his power is unlimited his word is here to give you to give you strength for the journey and his spirit is here to lead you and guide you into all truth I say what we need today is to quit looking at all the Fanatics and looking at all the crazy stuff around us and quit looking for all the faults in the message and the people you say well that one's not living it and that one's not living it and this one can't preach his way out of a wet paper bag and this one ain't no good I'm G to tell you right now what we need is to quit looking at the hum Humanity around us and start looking at the promises that are in the land that we're living in I say let's keep give God the praise he deserves I say let's give God thanks for bringing us into the land that we've I'll tell you what the devils are fighting you the Giants are all around you but God has set you aside and called you out of the mud pits so that you could enjoy the inheritance that you're in let us stand if few musicians would come I told you I'd stay close to on time and I'm trying I want to read this as they come he said now you say then the promise is mine sure but you'll fight every inch of it till your well you'll take you you you'll fight every step of but it's a battle the promise is yours that was a promised land that they had to fight to get theep every step they had to fight to get every step of it and the promise is yours somebody say the promise is mine promise is mine but you'll fight every inch of it it was God it was he said I was called to uh called of God to preach the gospel 31 years ago I thought ever since that's right I want to be a preacher they say welcome to the battle I want to be a message believer I want to be in the promised land welcome to the battle but God didn't give you this God didn't bring you into a battle without give equipping you to fight the Giants in the land he's given you Faith he's given you a message to hold you you've got what you need Church you young people you have what you need quit letting the devil beat you up fight for this land we're on our journey to Freedom we're on our journey to no more sickness no more pain no more heartache come on somebody you older people saying well it's getting closer every day well I'm going to tell you something it could be for any one of you it could be tomorrow it could be today but whenever it is we're we're on a journey to freedom but let's go let's go gracefully let's not go fighting the message let's not not let's not go fighting the preacher let's not go fighting each other but let's go with love and joy and peace and let's enjoy the journey because we already know what's at the end what can somebody say Amen we already know the end of the journey is ours and it's filled with grapes it's filled with grapes that you can't even carry you might as well just enjoy this journey and say Lord whatever you have for me if it's a shout let me shout if I'll tell you what if it's a scream let me scream if it's a dance teach me how to dance whatever God has for you come on take a hold of it it's your possession thank Lord I'm on the battlefield for my Lord how many ready for the meeting looking forward to what God can do for you you young people if you need the Holy Ghost don't you come to one service without seeking the Holy Ghost if you need to be baptized I guarantee he we'll baptize you if you

more today and a whole lot more tomorrow oh hallelujah oh isn't God good amen I just want to tell you a couple things in regards to the meetings and then we'll let you go I'm just really looking forward to it this year and it seems like every year we learn a little bit more what we're doing and and it gets a little easier but uh there's several jobs that uh brother Joel's got a book somewhere that got everybody's name in it with something to do you know but uh but if you don't have anything to do and you say well I I feel like I should help in some way then ask brother Joel or sister Virginia and they'll they they'll find something for you uh get put on a cleaning crew or something we're trying to even it out more where we don't have certain people just stuck over in the fellowship hall our weekend and and uh but you be praying for our deacons and our our workers and people that just it's just a it's a lot it's a lot for them to do but we want to keep doing it if we can do it I believe we should do it because it's such a blessing to us the meetings have been such a blessing so we want to do that we want to remember to take all your stuff with you everything everything that's yours if you think it might belong to you take it so uh so that way we can we can clear out the sanctuary they'll have to we've already moved the chairs what the vacuum and things and when we come in we're going to see people and we're going to see everybody that comes in so if you get her early and it's empty there will still be a brother here to seat you the reason we're doing that is because uh it helps us for Safety and Security but ALS also it helps we can put certain people certain places we got certain seats reserved and things like that CU we fill up around here usually during the meetings and we got a a small building but I'd rather have a small building full than a big building empty so so we thank God for everybody that comes many several folks coming from out of town and I guess more than we had last year from out of town at least so if we get our locals to show up we're going to have church so we're looking forward to that so much and and could we do this could we pray for one another this week as a church we need to be United one of the best things you can do is pray for somebody I I know there's people are going through things here and here we are coming to the meetings we're focused on that but you got you're fighting a battle sister Gloria fighting a battle right now and with things going on and uh different ones of you I know you're fighting a battle you pray for one another pray for one another pray for me if you don't got nobody else to pray for pray for our deacons pray for our our workers here in the church and brother Joel and brother Allen and the different ones will be helping I believe God if we could just unite together and do that and say I'm I'm just going to let go of everything else and believe God's going to move we need a move of God maybe these will be the last meetings we ever had before the Rapture I don't know I I but Sam I'll be all right if he comes tonight and we just skipped the meetings but we're going to a meeting in the air aren't we amen that's sweet sweet by and by let's bow our heads together we'll have a word of prayer and then we'll sing that meeting in the air tonight if we can do that let's let's pray heavenly father I thank you for this message that we've heard tonight I thank you for the blessings that you've given us Lord and a church family Lord I believe they love you and they love one another I pray you'd help them Lord we we want to care for one another and pray for one another Lord I I pray that we'd feel that this week Lord that each person that's here we would
