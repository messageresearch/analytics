[39:57] well and different ones, but we're just
[39:59] believing the Lord's going to lift all
[40:01] of this and uh we got kids going to camp
[40:05] and I'm going to go tomorrow. I may ride
[40:08] my own vehicle so I don't make anybody
[40:10] sick, but I'm going to go and and uh but
[40:12] we're going to take the kids tomorrow.
[40:14] You be praying for them. Would you do
[40:16] that? and and uh anytime we take all the
[40:18] kids, I know some of you all are going
[40:20] and and we're looking forward to having
[40:22] that time, but they're we're going to
[40:24] have so tonight they'll have six more
[40:27] services before the end of the week. So,
[40:30] uh so starting that'll be seven services
[40:32] in a row. So, you'll either come out
[40:34] revived or dead tired or both. So, but
[40:39] uh and then the drive and everything,
[40:40] but there's something about that that
[40:41] disarms you, you know, going to camp and
[40:44] it just kind of you lower your guard and
[40:46] you learn uh there's other Christians
[40:48] out there and people that love the Lord
[40:50] and serve the Lord. And I believe it'll
[40:52] be a help to each one of them. And I
[40:54] know uh Sister Melennia didn't feel well
[40:57] tonight, but Gabe, it's good to see
[40:58] she's she's here with the baby. I think
[41:00] we got the nursery audio fixed, so
[41:02] that'll be good. And uh we uh we sure
[41:06] appreciate all of you coming. Um I just
[41:09] wanted you to be praying for the young
[41:11] people. And I I still can't hear myself
[41:13] up here. I'm not
[41:16] sure. Um maybe my ears all stopped up,
[41:20] but you think it's my ears? All right.
[41:23] All right. It may be I feel like I'm in
[41:25] a well, but I think that must be the
[41:28] must be my uh way I feel tonight. But I
[41:31] believe the Lord's a healer. How many
[41:33] believe that tonight? If he saved you,
[41:35] he can heal you. He loves you. And uh we
[41:38] we may not always be well in this body,
[41:40] but we're going for a new one one of
[41:42] these days. I shared a clip today, but
[41:44] the biscal preaching, and he said, "The
[41:46] voice, the resurrection's already been
[41:48] spoken." And that really struck my
[41:50] heart. I thought, "We're going to walk
[41:52] through here one of these days and and
[41:55] just going to happen cuz it's already
[41:57] been spoken. It's already been set in
[41:58] order. And and one of these days, we're
[42:00] just going to start seeing our loved
[42:01] ones." What if today could be that day?
[42:04] What if tomorrow will be the real youth
[42:05] camp? We'd all get together and boy, I'm
[42:08] looking forward to that day. Amen. I
[42:10] just feel the presence of the Lord
[42:11] tonight. Amen. Amen. Amen. Let's sing uh
[42:16] uh uh only believe as brother Joel gets
[42:19] ready to come. And let's just make that
[42:22] our our prayer and our statement
[42:23] tonight. We're going to believe the word
[42:25] and believe that God's going to uh help
[42:28] us in these things. only
[42:33] believe. Oh, all things are
[42:39] possible if you
[42:41] only believe.
[42:46] [Music]
[42:50] Oh,
[42:57] all things are
[43:01] possible,
[43:04] holy. Can we sing it like this? Lord, I
[43:07] believe.
[43:09] Lord, I believe. Yes, we do.
[43:14] Oh
[43:15] Lord, I
[43:18] believe that all
[43:21] things are
[43:23] [Music]
[43:24] possible. Lord,
[43:27] I
[43:30] believe. Oh
[43:32] Lord, I
[43:36] believe.
[43:37] Lord, I believe.
[43:42] All
[43:44] things are
[43:46] possible. Oh Lord, I wonder if we could
[43:50] sing it like this. Jesus is here. Oh
[43:55] Jesus, you believe he's here tonight. Oh
[43:59] [Music]
[44:01] Jesus is
[44:03] here and all
[44:06] things are
[44:09] possible because
[44:12] Jesus is
[44:15] here. Oh
[44:17] Jesus is
[44:21] here.
[44:23] Jesus is here.
[44:27] All things are
[44:32] possible,
[44:35] Jesus. Amen. If you believe it, I wonder
[44:37] if we could just bow our heads together
[44:39] as they play that quietly. And if you
[44:42] have a need on your heart tonight, I
[44:43] wonder if we could just make that known
[44:44] by another lifted hand. Amen. Just want
[44:47] to especially remember our all of our
[44:49] young people going to camp. And I'm
[44:51] believing for a total deliverance for
[44:52] every one of them. How about y'all
[44:54] tonight, man? Let's just unite our faith
[44:56] together if we could for a few moments
[44:58] just to speak to the author. Heavenly
[45:00] Father, Lord, we want to thank you Lord
[45:02] for this opportunity to stand before
[45:04] your people. But Lord, we want to come
[45:06] tonight not just to have another
[45:08] service, but Lord, we want you to be
[45:10] present. Lord, we believe that all
[45:12] things are possible because you promised
[45:14] that where two or three were gathered,
[45:16] you would be here. And Lord, we believe
[45:18] if you're here, then we're going to
[45:19] worship you and we're going to listen to
[45:21] what you have to say for us tonight.
[45:23] Lord, I pray that everything would be
[45:25] laid aside that would stand in our way
[45:26] of a blessing here tonight in the
[45:28] church. And I ask, Lord, that you would
[45:30] just move on the scene for every young
[45:32] person, every old person, Lord, every
[45:34] person that couldn't make it tonight, if
[45:36] they're watching, I pray, Lord, you
[45:37] would heal their bodies, Lord, where
[45:39] they're sitting even right now, move
[45:41] upon us, we ask in Jesus' name. Amen.
[45:45] Amen. Are you happy to be in church
[45:47] tonight? Amen. God bless you. Good to
[45:49] see each and every one of you again. and
[45:51] uh come back here where it's nice and
[45:54] humid and everybody's sick and like
[45:56] Lord, I want to go back to
[45:58] Arizona. It was hot out there though
[46:00] after I left. They said it was
[46:01] 103 and uh that's just too hot for this
[46:04] time of
[46:05] year. But uh good to be back with you
[46:08] tonight. How many's going to youth camp
[46:09] for the first time? How many's going for
[46:12] the first time ever to youth camp? All
[46:13] right, we got a few. We got a few.
[46:15] That's good. Amen. Brother Ben said
[46:17] you're going to be wore out. I guarantee
[46:18] you will be. But you know what? I I
[46:21] think you're going to be blessed as
[46:22] well. So, we want to just be praying for
[46:24] them while they're gone and and uh we'll
[46:27] be leaving out tomorrow. So, pray for
[46:28] me. I think I've got all the young ones
[46:29] going to be with me. So, pray for me.
[46:32] How about that? Y'all need it. Amen. If
[46:35] you got your Bibles tonight, let's turn
[46:37] to Exodus chapter
[46:39] 23. Exodus chapter 23. We'll begin with
[46:43] verse 20. Exodus 23 and verse 20.
[46:51] Behold, I send an angel before
[46:54] thee to keep thee in the way, and to
[46:57] bring thee into a place which I have
[47:00] prepared. Beware of him and obey his
[47:03] voice, provoke him not, for he will not
[47:05] pardon your transgressions, for my name
[47:07] is in him. But if thou shalt indeed obey
[47:10] his voice, and do all that I speak, then
[47:13] I will be an enemy unto thine enemies,
[47:15] and an adversary unto thine adversaries.
[47:18] For mine angel shall go before thee, and
[47:21] bring thee in unto the Amorites, and the
[47:23] Hittites, and the Perizzites, and the
[47:25] Canaanites, the Hivites, the Jebusites,
[47:27] and I will cut them off. And in 2 Samuel
[47:30] chapter 22, 2 Samuel chapter 22 and
[47:33] verse
[47:35] 1, it says like this. And David spake
[47:38] unto the Lord the words of this
[47:40] song in in the day that the Lord had
[47:43] delivered him out of the hand of all of
[47:44] his enemies and out of the hand of Saul.
[47:47] And he said, "The Lord is my rock and my
[47:49] fortress and my deliverer." Somebody say
[47:52] amen to that. Amen. The God of my rock,
[47:55] in him will I trust. He is my shield and
[47:57] the horn of my salvation, my high tower,
[47:59] my refuge, my savior. Thou saveest me
[48:03] from violence. I will call on the Lord
[48:05] who is worthy to be praised. So shall I
[48:08] be saved from mine enemies. May the Lord
[48:11] add his blessings to the word. You may
[48:12] be seated. If I could title this thought
[48:15] tonight, be a total deliverance by a
[48:17] complete surrender. How many wants to
[48:19] surrender everything here tonight? I
[48:21] know a lot of times we all want a
[48:23] deliverance and we all want to overcome.
[48:25] We want a victory in our lives. How many
[48:27] of us need a victory in our lives? Amen.
[48:29] We all want that. But what we really
[48:30] have to do before there can come a
[48:32] victory, we've got to surrender our own
[48:34] way of thinking or our own ideas in
[48:37] order to get the deliverance that we
[48:40] need. And so when I was thinking about
[48:42] our kids going to youth camp, I thought,
[48:43] you know, it it's good to go and we want
[48:45] them to go. We want them to experience
[48:47] the freedom and the Holy Ghost. And and
[48:50] we want them to be delivered from
[48:51] anything that's holding them back from
[48:53] their full potential as Christians, but
[48:55] what we really need to make sure that
[48:57] they know is this, that there's got to
[49:00] be a surrendered heart. And there's got
[49:02] to be something on the inside to where
[49:04] they're they're not holding on to to
[49:07] things that maybe would be clouding a
[49:09] cloud over them that would try to hold
[49:11] them from keep them from getting the
[49:13] Holy Ghost or keep them from becoming
[49:14] better Christians. Amen. There's many
[49:16] kids maybe they go to camp one year and
[49:18] then they come back home and they get in
[49:20] an atmosphere, amen, that holds them
[49:22] back because they're because there's a
[49:24] there there's a parent at home maybe
[49:25] that needs to surrender their their way
[49:27] of doing things or their thinking. So
[49:29] what I would like to say tonight just
[49:31] for a few moments is we need to have a
[49:34] complete surrender here in this service
[49:36] so that our young people can have a
[49:38] complete and a total deliverance at camp
[49:41] this weekend. Amen. It's not just
[49:42] another camp. It's not just another
[49:44] meeting, but it needs to be a time for a
[49:46] change in our young people's lives. And
[49:48] and I believe it starts with us that's
[49:50] been, you know, we've been to camps and
[49:52] we've we've been filled with the Holy
[49:53] Ghost, but I think we need to surrender
[49:55] ourselves so that when our kids come
[49:57] home, we can really give in and give,
[49:59] you know, give give our lives to the
[50:01] Lord and let our kids see that we mean
[50:03] business with God. And Amen. We're not
[50:05] just playing church, but we're here to
[50:07] live out what we're talking about, to
[50:09] live what we're preaching, live what
[50:10] we're saying. Amen. And live the message
[50:12] of the hour. I believe somebody will. I
[50:14] believe it needs to be us. And so,
[50:16] Brother Brandon would say it like this.
[50:18] He said, "If a person completely
[50:19] surrendered to the devil will give him
[50:21] twice his strength, what will a man
[50:23] completely surrender to God do?" Well,
[50:26] think about it tonight, church. He said,
[50:27] "See, it'll make you so weak and maybe
[50:29] you're crippled and can't stand up, but
[50:31] surrender yourself to God and a new life
[50:34] and new strength comes in." And he said,
[50:37] "You go to walk it away." face that I
[50:38] seen a little people when their little
[50:40] limbs was wasn't wasn't hardly that big
[50:42] grown men and women eat up with cancer
[50:44] rise to the floor they hadn't stood up
[50:46] for months and so weak they couldn't
[50:47] have stood up or anything else but he
[50:49] said under the power of God get up and
[50:51] walk through the house praising God and
[50:53] get well he said what is it full
[50:55] surrender to God and that's what it
[50:57] takes is a complete surrender so if you
[51:00] need healing tonight you've got to
[51:02] surrender your own unbelief and and say
[51:04] I'm ready to take my healing tonight
[51:06] amen so Brother Bam would go on. He
[51:08] said, "Did you ever see a man that had
[51:10] been stricken by an evil spirit like
[51:11] that? He is several times his strength."
[51:14] He said, "I've noticed him in the
[51:15] meetings when groups of police couldn't
[51:17] even hold them, they would tear the
[51:18] police to pieces and throw them aside."
[51:20] He said, "Because he's so he" He said,
[51:22] "And and carry on." He said, "Because he
[51:24] so fully surrendered to the evil one. It
[51:27] took possession of him and he had not
[51:29] his own understanding." He said, "Now he
[51:31] only did what the evil spirit put on him
[51:33] to do." He said, "Then I thought," he
[51:35] said, brother Random's talking. And he
[51:36] said, "I thought with a complete
[51:37] surrender to the devil can give a man
[51:39] maybe five times his strength, what
[51:41] would a complete surrender to God do to
[51:43] a man? And what would it do to a
[51:45] that's weak in body and can't walk or
[51:47] something if we would just completely
[51:49] yield to the Holy Ghost? Give us super
[51:52] strength to rise in the name cuz greater
[51:54] is he that's in you than he that's in
[51:56] the world." See, the strength in God
[51:59] that's in you is greater than any
[52:01] affliction that can come on you. He said
[52:03] there is nothing can overtake you that
[52:06] can supersede you because you are full
[52:08] of superpower. Well, can you say amen?
[52:10] He said you are full of superpower and
[52:12] that superpower is the Holy Spirit that
[52:15] dominates your life if you are a
[52:18] Christian. So you are dominated by the
[52:20] very life of Christ that is in you.
[52:22] Amen. Just think about how strong you
[52:24] are little bride. Amen. You have the
[52:26] same strength that Christ had. Amen. to
[52:28] defeat devils and to raise up the the
[52:30] the sick and and the halt and the maim
[52:32] and and think about he could raise the
[52:34] dead. The same strength that did that
[52:36] through his body is now doing it through
[52:38] a bride body today. Well, can you say
[52:41] amen? Amen. There's no reason for us to
[52:43] be defeated and and downtrodden and
[52:45] thinking that we're nobody because if
[52:47] his spirit is in you, amen, you are more
[52:49] than a match for whatever the devil's
[52:51] got for you. Can you say amen? Why?
[52:53] Because we've surrendered ourselves. And
[52:55] when there's surrendering that comes
[52:57] then then there there is a there is a
[52:59] deliverance that comes with it. And so
[53:01] brother Brandon would say it like this.
[53:03] He said just Abraham he said watch here.
[53:05] Abraham was an heir to the world and Lot
[53:08] was a type of the lukewarm believer. He
[53:10] was a believer. He had left his homeland
[53:12] to sojourn with God but always never
[53:14] fully surrendered. And he said that's
[53:17] what's the trouble in the full gospel
[53:18] church tonight along with the rest of
[53:21] them is the peoples who left the world
[53:23] and and they keep out of the world. They
[53:24] don't they don't want to go to gambling
[53:26] and drinking and carry on. They are a
[53:28] believer but have never made a complete
[53:30] surrender. So, brother Brandham is
[53:32] saying here you could have left aside
[53:34] the gambling and you may have laid aside
[53:36] uh you know drinking or maybe even
[53:38] dressing like the world. Amen. But you
[53:40] haven't made a complete surrender
[53:42] because there's a little room in your
[53:43] house that you don't want him to go into
[53:45] because in there was secret sins and and
[53:48] things that you're hiding and you don't
[53:50] want the you don't want anybody to see
[53:52] those things about you. What can you
[53:53] say? Amen. Amen. You, Brother Brandon
[53:55] would say it like this. You're welcome
[53:56] to come into my house and but don't come
[53:58] past the front door. You just stay right
[54:00] there. Don't come into this room and
[54:02] don't come into that room. And Jesus
[54:03] will do. He'll come wherever you invite
[54:05] him. But I want him to come in every
[54:07] room of my house, every every inch of my
[54:10] vessel. And I want him to change my
[54:12] life. I don't want to surrender just
[54:14] sometimes to him or just Sunday morning
[54:16] to him or just Wednesday nights to him,
[54:18] but I want to surrender every day of my
[54:20] life to him and let him take control
[54:22] because I need deliverance in my life
[54:24] and I need changes in my life. And
[54:26] listen church, I can't do it on my own.
[54:29] I've got to surrender my will and my
[54:31] wants to his way and he can deliver me
[54:34] out of every circumstance and every
[54:36] everything that would come against me.
[54:39] Brother Brand would go on to say it like
[54:40] this. Are you still with me tonight?
[54:42] Brother Brandon would say like this. He
[54:43] said he said, "There's a lot of you that
[54:45] will say, "Well, I'll give 15 minutes on
[54:47] Sunday morning, but if you preach any
[54:49] longer than that, I'll just I'll get up
[54:50] and go home." Well, he said, "You got 15
[54:52] minutes on Sunday morning." And that's
[54:54] what you give to God. Some of them said,
[54:55] "I can maybe suffer a half hour. I don't
[54:58] know how I can do it." Well, see, that's
[55:01] what you get. 15 minutes, a half hour.
[55:03] See, what can you give? God will receive
[55:05] what you will give. But God wants all of
[55:08] you. He wants every bit of you. He wants
[55:12] all. He wants everything you are. He
[55:14] wants your life. He wants your
[55:15] testimony. He wants every minute you
[55:17] live. He wants you to live right, act
[55:19] right, talk right, do right. He wants
[55:21] everything perfectly surrendered to him
[55:24] that he can lead you and guide you and
[55:26] put you into places where he wants you
[55:28] to go led of the spirit. Amen. So, if
[55:31] you're leading yourself and you're not
[55:33] following the word of God, listen
[55:34] church, then you're bound to mess up
[55:36] somewhere. But if we can surrender our
[55:38] life and say whatever he wants for me,
[55:40] that's what I'm willing to give him.
[55:42] Amen. I'm not just want Come on,
[55:44] somebody. Amen. The reason you're here
[55:46] on a Wednesday night is because you you
[55:47] you decided that you would surrender
[55:50] your time on a Wednesday night to him
[55:52] instead of whatever else you could be
[55:53] doing. Amen. The reason you show up at
[55:55] church, why? Listen, church, I know some
[55:57] sick and some can't make it, but there's
[55:59] a desire in a Christian that wants to
[56:02] give their time to the Lord. Amen.
[56:04] There's a desire in our hearts that
[56:05] says, "Lord, I want to fellowship with
[56:07] believers and I want to give you my
[56:09] time." Listen, everything you can give
[56:11] him would never be enough for what he's
[56:13] already given you. Everything, every bit
[56:15] of praise you could give him is not
[56:17] enough for the praise that he's worthy
[56:19] of. Can you say amen? He's worthy of
[56:22] everything. So, I think if we're just
[56:24] giving him a little bit, we're robbing
[56:26] God. I think it's time we give him
[56:28] everything that we've got. You say, "I
[56:30] need deliverance in my life. I need a I
[56:32] need a deliverance from this spirit
[56:34] that's holding me back. Or I need a
[56:35] deliverance of this that Come on,
[56:37] somebody. You young people, you're
[56:39] you're dealing with things that are
[56:40] trying to keep you from your full
[56:42] surrendered life. Listen, if you'll give
[56:44] it to God, then God will deliver you
[56:46] from that thing. I believe tonight we
[56:48] need to give him our time. Give him our
[56:50] resources. Give him everything we can
[56:52] and let God take control of it. He can
[56:55] multiply if you need multiplying. Amen.
[56:57] He can give you the very desires of your
[57:00] heart. Amen. If you got sickness
[57:01] tonight, give it to God because why? He
[57:04] is the healer. Amen. If you're in a
[57:06] backsliding condition tonight, give that
[57:08] to God and he can bring you back into
[57:10] life and fellowship with him. Amen. I
[57:12] think what we need tonight before youth
[57:14] camp ever gets started is a full
[57:16] surrender and say, "Lord, I want you to
[57:18] come and fill every young person, every
[57:21] old person, every parent's home. When
[57:23] the kids come home, I want to see a
[57:25] house on fire so that my kids aren't
[57:28] coming home to some dead cold place to
[57:30] to say, "Well, well, it was good at
[57:32] camp, but it ain't good at home." No, I
[57:34] want my house, Amen. to feel like camp.
[57:36] Why? Because I want the devil to know
[57:39] that he can't have our young people. I
[57:41] want the devil to know that he can't rob
[57:43] me of God's time. I want the devil to
[57:45] know whose side I'm on. Why? because I'm
[57:47] I'm surrendering my wants and my my will
[57:51] to him so that I can be delivered. Amen.
[57:54] I think we all need a deliverance at
[57:56] times because you'll realize there's an
[57:58] age that we're living in and it's an age
[58:00] of leosia and a lukewarm condition and I
[58:02] would say God don't ever let me fall
[58:04] into that situation. Amen. I don't want
[58:07] to be rich and have need of nothing but
[58:09] I want to be a church that's on fire for
[58:10] God that when the word is preached
[58:12] across the pulpit I can say amen to it.
[58:15] When the word comes into my heart and
[58:17] and if it comes into a room and maybe it
[58:19] hurts me a little bit because it was
[58:21] something that I was hiding, but the
[58:23] word discerned your thought. It
[58:24] discerned that thought that was in your
[58:26] heart and maybe you didn't want the word
[58:28] to get there, but it found its way
[58:30] anyway. Let me go ahead and tell you
[58:31] something. That is what we need tonight
[58:34] is let the word go to work in our lives
[58:36] and it will deliver us from our sickness
[58:39] and our diseases. I'm not just talking
[58:41] naturally, but I'm talking our spiritual
[58:43] diseases and our spiritual weaknesses
[58:45] and our spir Come on, somebody. That
[58:48] brother Brandham would say it like this,
[58:49] the body of Christ is the sickest body.
[58:51] I know. I would say tonight if it is
[58:53] that way, then then we need deliverance
[58:56] from the sickness and we need
[58:57] deliverance from the gloom and doom.
[58:59] Well, can you say amen tonight? I know
[59:01] it's Wednesday night, but we might as
[59:02] well go ahead and have a good time in
[59:04] the house of God. Why? Because this is a
[59:07] place where God has chosen to meet us
[59:08] tonight. Amen. Let's give him our time
[59:10] while we're here. Let's give him
[59:12] everything we got. Give him your praise.
[59:14] Give him your love. Give him your
[59:15] adoration. Give him everything because
[59:18] he's worthy of it. Can you say amen?
[59:21] Amen. And so, Brother Brandham would say
[59:23] the important thing, one of the most
[59:24] important things we must master is
[59:26] remember this. And especially you young
[59:28] preachers, he said, "Alay members alike,
[59:30] there's one thing that we've got to
[59:31] master if we expect to fulfill God's
[59:33] desire in our life." And he we have to
[59:35] master the thought of human ability. He
[59:38] said, ' If we ever get to a spot where
[59:39] we think we can do it with our own
[59:40] intelligence and our own abilities,
[59:43] we've got to master that in such a way
[59:45] that we can get rid of the thing and lay
[59:47] it aside so that God can use us. That's
[59:50] right. Can you say amen? Amen. Brother
[59:52] go on. He said and make a complete
[59:54] surrender. He said we cannot use one
[59:56] ability. We've got to make a complete
[59:59] surrender. And to come to God, you've
[1:00:01] got to surrender to him both soul, body,
[1:00:04] and spirit. Can the church say amen? He
[1:00:06] said, "And everything that you are has
[1:00:09] to be surrendered to God in order that
[1:00:11] he can work his will in you and in me."
[1:00:15] I love the the humility of a prophet
[1:00:17] there that he couldn't do nothing
[1:00:19] without God coming down and actually
[1:00:21] coming into a surrendered heart even of
[1:00:23] a prophet. What can you say? Amen.
[1:00:25] There's nobody too big that can't
[1:00:26] surrender to God. There's nobody that
[1:00:29] that gets in there. You get Listen, the
[1:00:31] the Holy Ghost will not make you bigger
[1:00:32] than God. The Holy Ghost will make you
[1:00:34] surrender yourself to an almighty God.
[1:00:37] The Holy Ghost will come into you and
[1:00:39] change your very thoughts so that you
[1:00:41] don't sit in a church service and
[1:00:43] criticize everything that's done and
[1:00:45] come against everything that's said. But
[1:00:47] what you do is say, "Lord, whatever I
[1:00:49] have need of, come and fill every inch
[1:00:51] of my vessel and come and move
[1:00:53] everything out of my life." Come on,
[1:00:55] somebody. What we need is quit
[1:00:56] criticizing and start receiving with a
[1:00:59] surrendered heart.
[1:01:02] Yes, sir. Well, I I don't know if
[1:01:03] Brother Ben took care of you on Sunday
[1:01:04] or not, but this is on my heart tonight.
[1:01:06] Are y'all okay? Amen. Listen, church. I
[1:01:08] I I don't want to beat you over the
[1:01:10] head. This is for me. If you'll notice,
[1:01:11] he said, "Young preachers have to
[1:01:13] remember this. We've got to surrender.
[1:01:15] We can't do nothing on our own ability.
[1:01:17] If I had any, I couldn't do nothing on
[1:01:19] my own ability. It's got to come from
[1:01:22] God. I've got to surrender my vessel to
[1:01:24] what he once said." Amen. your pastor
[1:01:27] can stand here, but if all is if he's
[1:01:29] just speaking and he and he's never
[1:01:31] studied or he's never sat back there and
[1:01:32] prayed, but what what he's going to be
[1:01:34] speaking is just his words. But when
[1:01:36] he's met with God and he's done, he he's
[1:01:38] put in the time and and he comes out to
[1:01:40] you, he's not speaking what he wants to
[1:01:42] say, but he surrenders himself to the
[1:01:45] will of the father and he speaks what
[1:01:47] you need to hear. I know a lot of times
[1:01:50] we don't want to hear what's being
[1:01:51] preached, church, but come on, we need
[1:01:53] to surrender. Amen. Do you realize what
[1:01:55] he's given us? Do you realize what he's
[1:01:57] done for us? Amen. What he's done for
[1:01:59] us, he surrendered his own life for us.
[1:02:01] He gave everything for me. Amen. Come
[1:02:04] on, church. Amen. He had to surrender to
[1:02:06] the will of the father in order to save
[1:02:08] a wretch like me that didn't deserve to
[1:02:09] be saved. Amen. He had to come he had to
[1:02:12] come down and and become a lowly human
[1:02:14] and tempted and all like manner of man.
[1:02:16] He had to become a nobody so that you
[1:02:18] could become a somebody. Amen. If he
[1:02:21] could do that for me, I say, Lord, help
[1:02:23] me to surrender just like Jesus did.
[1:02:26] Help me to surrender everything that I
[1:02:28] am. Not my will, but thine be done.
[1:02:31] Everything that you would want for my
[1:02:33] life, come into me and make me what you
[1:02:35] want, not just what I want. Brother
[1:02:38] Random would go on like this. He said,
[1:02:39] he said, I wonder today when God leads
[1:02:41] us to a life of complete surrender and
[1:02:43] service to him, I wonder if our spirits
[1:02:45] and sometimes don't rebel. Kind of
[1:02:46] showing that. Wonder if we're a lamb.
[1:02:48] See, a lamb is obedient. A lamb is
[1:02:50] sacrificial. Amen. He said it doesn't
[1:02:52] claim it's its own. You lay it right
[1:02:54] down and shear the wool off of it and
[1:02:56] it's the only thing it's got. It never
[1:02:57] says anything about it. Just sacrifices
[1:02:59] everything it's got. Amen. The life of a
[1:03:02] Christian is a sacrificial life.
[1:03:05] The life of a Christian was never
[1:03:06] promised to be rosy and and and good
[1:03:09] because it's a bunch of humans coming
[1:03:10] together trying to find the will of the
[1:03:12] Lord. and and sometimes we we get
[1:03:14] together and and you know what happens
[1:03:16] is humanity gets in the way and we we we
[1:03:18] get our eyes on each other instead of on
[1:03:20] what he wants us to do. And so, Brother
[1:03:22] Brand would go on. He said, "Now, he
[1:03:24] said just everything. The lamb
[1:03:25] sacrifices everything. It gives
[1:03:27] everything, everything away, itself and
[1:03:30] all that it is." And that's the way a
[1:03:32] real Christian is. If they're if they'll
[1:03:35] sacrifice themselves, carrying nothing
[1:03:37] for this world, but giving all they got
[1:03:39] to God. See, and brother would go on. He
[1:03:41] said, "One night when God ordained that
[1:03:43] lamb that should be killed, the type of
[1:03:45] Christ and blood was dipped in hip,
[1:03:47] which is just a common weed." He says
[1:03:48] and he said that's when Israel become
[1:03:50] completely delivered with not a hoof
[1:03:53] left behind. All that belonged to them
[1:03:55] was delivered. Their families, their
[1:03:56] loved ones, and everything was delivered
[1:03:58] when they completely come under the
[1:04:00] blood. So I want you to notice if you
[1:04:02] can just get the blood over our
[1:04:04] children, then they can have a complete
[1:04:06] deliverance. Well, come on somebody. If
[1:04:08] we can just get the Holy Ghost going in
[1:04:10] our services, I believe that there could
[1:04:11] be a complete deliverance over
[1:04:13] everything that's holding you,
[1:04:15] everything that's binding you from your
[1:04:17] worship, everything that's binding you
[1:04:19] from a surrender, everything that you
[1:04:20] have need of, if you can just get under
[1:04:23] the blood. Can you say amen? Amen. He
[1:04:25] said you're He said everything
[1:04:26] delivered. So when everything comes
[1:04:27] under the blood, when your sins come
[1:04:29] under the blood, when you're smoking,
[1:04:30] when you're gambling, when you're
[1:04:31] cheating, when you're stealing, when
[1:04:33] you're lying, when everything is brought
[1:04:35] under the blood, then there will be a
[1:04:37] total deliverance. He said, if you've
[1:04:39] wronged somebody, make it right. You
[1:04:40] can't bring that under the blood. It
[1:04:42] won't stay. You can't bring it.
[1:04:44] Something won't let you do it. When
[1:04:46] yourself is completely, totally brought
[1:04:48] under the blood, there'll be a total
[1:04:50] deliverance. Can the church say amen? He
[1:04:52] said, then you'll have a freedom like
[1:04:54] you've never known before. Right. Is
[1:04:57] that what we need? Then you've got to
[1:04:59] bring your sins under the blood and
[1:05:02] accept the the the token life that God
[1:05:04] has given to the believer. Listen,
[1:05:06] church, it's not hard. It just requires
[1:05:08] a a surrender. You you're you're laying
[1:05:11] your sins at the altar, and you're not
[1:05:13] going to go back to them. And you you've
[1:05:14] come with a heart that is willing to
[1:05:16] receive, a heart full of surrender. And
[1:05:19] when you lay the things down, it's under
[1:05:21] the blood. That's when you can find your
[1:05:24] freedom. And I want to say to the young
[1:05:26] people, if you go to camp, don't go over
[1:05:28] there carrying grudges. And don't go
[1:05:29] over there just looking, amen, to see
[1:05:31] what kind of faults you can find. Amen.
[1:05:33] But go and and open your heart to the
[1:05:35] word of God that's being preached. And
[1:05:37] and when the Holy Spirit touches you,
[1:05:39] surrender to that Holy Spirit and you'll
[1:05:41] find the freedom that you're looking
[1:05:43] for. I want to say tonight that don't
[1:05:46] just just go for the young people, but I
[1:05:48] say, Lord, Lord, set me free under your
[1:05:50] blood. Amen. There's a freedom under the
[1:05:52] blood. Amen. There's no condemnation
[1:05:54] under the blood. I mean, there's freedom
[1:05:56] there. Why? Because you've you've
[1:05:58] surrendered yourself. You've been
[1:06:00] delivered from the thing and now you can
[1:06:02] come before God boldly saying, "I have
[1:06:05] surrendered my life and I owe it all to
[1:06:07] you. I give it all to you. I am nothing
[1:06:10] without you." And then he will deliver
[1:06:12] you. Amen. If my people who are called
[1:06:14] by my name will humble themselves and
[1:06:16] pray, then will I hear from heaven.
[1:06:18] Listen, church. If you can humble
[1:06:19] yourselves and surrender yourselves and
[1:06:22] lay aside every weight and sin that
[1:06:24] would so easily beset you, you can be
[1:06:28] totally delivered. Can the church say
[1:06:30] amen? Amen. You want freedom in the
[1:06:33] house of God? Amen. Lay aside those
[1:06:35] sins.
[1:06:37] Are y'all okay so far? Brother go on
[1:06:40] down here. He said like this. You'll
[1:06:42] have freedom. He said like you've never
[1:06:44] known before. When everything is brought
[1:06:45] under the blood, brought in submissive
[1:06:48] to the kingdom of God, then there will
[1:06:50] be a real deliverance. Now, brother
[1:06:53] talks about Jesus and his and his
[1:06:55] surrender. He said Jesus was completely
[1:06:57] totally man. He could cry like a man. He
[1:06:59] could eat like a man. He could be tired
[1:07:01] like a man. He was completely totally
[1:07:03] man in his physical being and in his
[1:07:06] spirit. He was completely totally God.
[1:07:09] So, he was the fullness of God. And and
[1:07:11] brother Brandham said he didn't have it
[1:07:12] in a measure. He was he made his flesh
[1:07:14] submissive to the spirit that was in
[1:07:15] him. You see, he was tempted in all
[1:07:17] manners like we are. He was a man, not
[1:07:20] an angel. He was a man. He had desires
[1:07:22] and temptations just like we do. The
[1:07:25] Bible said he did. He was a man, not an
[1:07:27] angel above temptations. And brother
[1:07:29] Brandham quotes Hebrews 1:4 said he was
[1:07:30] made lower than the angels. He was man
[1:07:32] completely man that God took a complete
[1:07:34] man to bring total deliverance and he
[1:07:37] filled him with his spirit. The Holy
[1:07:39] Ghost was in was within was in him
[1:07:41] without measure. And he was tempted like
[1:07:43] we were. And he was completely God. He
[1:07:45] proved it when he raised the dead, when
[1:07:47] he stopped nature, the roaring seas, and
[1:07:49] the mighty winds, when he spoke to the
[1:07:51] trees and so forth. They obeyed him. And
[1:07:53] he was God inside. And he could have
[1:07:55] been man for he was man. But he totally
[1:07:57] and completely delivered himself as a
[1:08:00] man into the hands of God for the
[1:08:02] service of God. And he is our example.
[1:08:05] We are men and women. We are also
[1:08:06] Christians. If he's our example, let us
[1:08:09] completely deliver ourselves into the
[1:08:11] hands of the Holy Ghost that we might be
[1:08:14] subjects of the kingdom of God. So we're
[1:08:16] not being ruled by what the world wants
[1:08:18] you to do. We're not being ruled by our
[1:08:20] own thoughts and our own mind. Amen. But
[1:08:22] we are be we are subjects of a kingdom
[1:08:24] that is not on this earth, but is a
[1:08:26] kingdom that is set up on the other
[1:08:28] side. Are y'all still with me tonight?
[1:08:29] Amen. We are not being ruled by the by
[1:08:31] the spirits that is on the land. We are
[1:08:33] not leosia because we are not under a
[1:08:36] leodyian spirit. Can you say amen? Amen.
[1:08:38] But we are under the headship of Christ
[1:08:41] the word. And the word is what is
[1:08:43] changing our lives. It is what is making
[1:08:45] us come on somebody. The word itself is
[1:08:48] has come down. And it is and has raised
[1:08:51] us up to be sons and daughters of God.
[1:08:53] And it has made us now, amen, to sit in
[1:08:56] heavenly places. And and we are no
[1:08:58] longer just those that are coming age to
[1:09:00] age and trying to find a way out. But we
[1:09:02] have seen the light of the hour. Amen.
[1:09:05] Can the church say amen? We have seen
[1:09:07] the light of the hour. And we are no
[1:09:09] longer in bondage, but we are free in
[1:09:12] Come on, somebody. We are free because
[1:09:14] who the son has set free, who the word
[1:09:17] has made free is free indeed. You
[1:09:19] surrender yourself to the word and the
[1:09:22] word will change your life. It's as
[1:09:25] simple as that. It's as simple as
[1:09:27] saying, Lord, I believe, but help thou
[1:09:30] my unbelief. I believe, but don't but
[1:09:33] come into that room where there's still
[1:09:34] sin hiding. And come into that place
[1:09:36] where there's still doubt there. I'm a
[1:09:38] believer, but come into the room that
[1:09:40] I've been trying to hide from the
[1:09:41] pastor. Come into the room that I've
[1:09:43] been trying to hide from the rest of the
[1:09:45] church. Come in and change me because I
[1:09:47] need changing. And that's what we've got
[1:09:49] to come to in order to have a total
[1:09:52] deliverance. We've got to have a
[1:09:53] complete surrender. Amen. And it's one
[1:09:56] thing to get delivered from one thing or
[1:09:58] this little thing and then you surrender
[1:10:00] another part and you get deliverance
[1:10:01] from that. Amen. But if you'll have a
[1:10:03] complete surrender, then you can have a
[1:10:06] total deliverance. Do you really want
[1:10:08] freedom? Then you need a total
[1:10:09] deliverance.
[1:10:11] Y'all still with me so far? Amen. I I I
[1:10:14] believe that what we need tonight is not
[1:10:15] so much just a just a theology, but we
[1:10:18] need to get on our knees again and say,
[1:10:19] "Lord, I I believe, but there's
[1:10:21] something in me that I want you to
[1:10:23] change." Listen, church. You never get
[1:10:25] too big to where you've got something
[1:10:27] that needs to change for the better.
[1:10:30] There's got to be something on the
[1:10:32] inside that says, "I'm not good enough
[1:10:33] like I am. I want to be a better
[1:10:35] Christian." Listen, I'm not saying
[1:10:37] you're not good Christians. I believe
[1:10:38] y'all are good Christians to be here on
[1:10:40] a Wednesday night. I believe y'all are
[1:10:42] are saved. And you know, I would look
[1:10:44] around and say every person in the
[1:10:45] building, I believe, is a is a believer.
[1:10:47] But listen, I I I believe too, but
[1:10:50] throughout my life, there's been parts
[1:10:52] of me that has been tried to hide. And
[1:10:54] there's been parts of me that I wouldn't
[1:10:56] surrender because listen, there there I
[1:10:58] wasn't really satis I wasn't really fed
[1:11:00] up with that part good enough yet. But
[1:11:02] let me go and tell you something.
[1:11:04] There's got to be something in on the
[1:11:06] inside of you that really wants a full
[1:11:08] surrender. There's got to be something
[1:11:10] on the inside of you that says, "No
[1:11:12] matter, it don't matter if there's food
[1:11:14] for me to eat. I I want to I want to eat
[1:11:16] at your table. Amen. It don't matter if
[1:11:18] there's water for me to drink. I want to
[1:11:20] drink at your fountain. It don't matter
[1:11:21] if if nobody else in church is on fire
[1:11:24] for God. I want to be on fire for God.
[1:11:26] It don't matter if anybody else shows up
[1:11:28] on a Wednesday night. I want to show up
[1:11:30] and show the devil. Listen, it's not
[1:11:32] just it's not to make me feel better.
[1:11:34] It's not because I'm not because I'm
[1:11:36] going to hell for it, but I really want
[1:11:38] to show God that I'm surrendering my
[1:11:40] time. I'm surrendering everything that I
[1:11:42] am in order to be in his presence. Amen.
[1:11:46] When you really love God, Amen. This
[1:11:48] comes natural to the believers. But
[1:11:50] listen, there there is a part of us
[1:11:51] that's always fighting the devil. There
[1:11:53] is a part of us that's always trying to
[1:11:55] come against us and and make us do
[1:11:57] wrong. Listen, we Paul would say, "Amen,
[1:11:59] when I do good, evil is present." Amen.
[1:12:01] So you you can try to do good and then
[1:12:03] that the devil's right there to try to
[1:12:05] make you do bad. And and so you're
[1:12:06] always listen, I know it's not it's not
[1:12:09] an easy walk. And so it it don't mean
[1:12:11] you listen I some of you may have say
[1:12:13] well I failed last week or I failed this
[1:12:15] month or I failed this year. Listen it
[1:12:17] don't matter if you failed. Can you get
[1:12:19] back up? Can you go ahead and surrender?
[1:12:21] Say quit holding on to your failings and
[1:12:24] say Lord help me to walk in your way.
[1:12:27] Help me to walk in your word. I I'm
[1:12:29] tired of looking back at what I have
[1:12:31] done. I'm ready to look forward to what
[1:12:34] God's going to do for me. I say our
[1:12:36] young people, you're going to fall.
[1:12:38] Listen, the devil's here to make you
[1:12:40] fall. The devil's here to try to show
[1:12:42] you how bad you are. The devil's here to
[1:12:44] try to tell you you're not good enough.
[1:12:45] The devil's here to try to tell you
[1:12:47] there is no Holy Ghost. Welcome to
[1:12:49] church say amen. The devil's here to
[1:12:50] tell you all kinds of lies. But you know
[1:12:52] how the devil, you know how to tell when
[1:12:54] the devil's lying? Every time he opens
[1:12:55] his mouth and what God is going to say
[1:12:58] to you is you are good enough. And and
[1:13:01] be, you know why? because his blood came
[1:13:03] and covered every sin and every mistake
[1:13:06] and every every transgression, every
[1:13:08] little secret sin. Listen, you think you
[1:13:10] hid that from God. You never hid nothing
[1:13:12] from God. He knows all about it if
[1:13:14] you'll repent of that thing. He is ready
[1:13:16] and willing to forgive you. Amen.
[1:13:19] Listen, this God is not trying to send
[1:13:20] you to hell. Amen. He just wants a
[1:13:22] surrendered people that he can have to
[1:13:24] make a rapture. Amen. There's going to
[1:13:26] be somebody surrender themselves so much
[1:13:28] to this end time word that they're going
[1:13:30] to leave this earth in a body change.
[1:13:33] And so it's not going to be people
[1:13:34] looking, amen, for their own way and
[1:13:36] their own and listen, well, God's got to
[1:13:38] come like this or or this has got no God
[1:13:41] wants somebody to surrender to however
[1:13:42] he moves, we're going to move with him.
[1:13:45] Amen. The children of Israel, Amen, they
[1:13:47] weren't walking. They were not walking
[1:13:48] listen exactly how they wanted to. But
[1:13:51] if they wanted to get to the promised
[1:13:52] land, they had to follow the message for
[1:13:54] the hour. They had to follow the pillar
[1:13:56] of fire of the day. And that same
[1:13:58] headship that was with was Moses is the
[1:14:00] same headship that we're following
[1:14:02] today. So I would say today, let's not
[1:14:04] look around each other and say, "Well,
[1:14:07] if so and so would get right with God,
[1:14:09] then I'd get right with God." No, let's
[1:14:12] make it about us. I would say tonight
[1:14:14] that this this little talk, this little
[1:14:16] message is not just for it's not just
[1:14:18] for everybody else in the building, but
[1:14:19] it's for me. Amen. I've got to surrender
[1:14:21] my own wills and my own wants and and
[1:14:23] everything that I am. Because listen,
[1:14:25] church, I can't stand here and preach
[1:14:27] the uncarchable riches of God to you and
[1:14:29] then have something in my life to say,
[1:14:31] "Well, well, God can have he can have my
[1:14:33] time on Wednesdays and he can have my
[1:14:35] time on Sundays, but on Mondays and
[1:14:37] Tuesdays and Thursdays and Fridays and
[1:14:39] Saturdays, I'm going to live like the de
[1:14:41] like like the devil, you know." But let
[1:14:43] me go and tell you something. That's not
[1:14:44] what God wants of a man to stand in the
[1:14:46] pulpit. He wants all of you surrendered
[1:14:49] so that he can use your vessel for his
[1:14:51] good. Amen. So, but that but it's not
[1:14:53] just the preachers. It Come on,
[1:14:55] somebody. It's not just the preachers
[1:14:57] that he wants to surrender from. He
[1:14:59] wants to surrender from from every
[1:15:00] person that has a job in the church or
[1:15:02] every person that feels like you don't
[1:15:04] have nothing to do. Amen. You do have
[1:15:06] something to do. You can surrender.
[1:15:08] And God will use you in ways like you've
[1:15:11] never seen before. Amen. If you'll just
[1:15:13] surrender your life, you'll see. Amen.
[1:15:15] that God, if you'll really surrender,
[1:15:18] God has got a plan for your life. Yeah.
[1:15:21] Can you say amen? Brother Ram would go
[1:15:23] on down. He said, "But he was totally
[1:15:25] delivered because he trusted in God."
[1:15:26] He's talking about Jesus. Did not the
[1:15:29] psalmist say, "Thou will deliver him for
[1:15:30] he has completely trusted in me." And he
[1:15:32] goes on down. He said, "Some hour when
[1:15:34] we come to the end of life's journey, I
[1:15:36] want it for mine. I know you want it for
[1:15:37] yours." I want him to say, "I'll deliver
[1:15:40] him out of the jaws of death, for he's
[1:15:42] trusted in me. Yeah, he surrendered
[1:15:44] himself to me and I will deliver. Well,
[1:15:47] can the church say amen? Amen. That's
[1:15:49] what I want to hear is well done. Why?
[1:15:51] Because it wasn't my own marriage that
[1:15:53] got me there, but because I surrendered
[1:15:55] everything to him.
[1:15:58] Yes, I fell down. Yes, I made mistakes,
[1:16:00] but I was surrendered to him. And so
[1:16:02] when I did that, then there was
[1:16:03] something on the inside of me that said,
[1:16:05] "Come back to me. Surrender. Let me come
[1:16:08] in there and let the word come in to
[1:16:10] every room in your house.
[1:16:14] Y'all okay tonight?
[1:16:16] Brand would go on down like this. He
[1:16:18] said he totally delivered every sin. He
[1:16:21] delivered the church. So there's no need
[1:16:23] for us to live underprivileged people.
[1:16:25] There's no need for us to live in a
[1:16:26] defeated state because he defeated the
[1:16:29] devil and took all the principalities
[1:16:31] and powers and subdued them under his
[1:16:34] feet. And they have no legal rights to
[1:16:36] rule over you. We are Christians filled
[1:16:39] with the Holy Ghost. We don't have the
[1:16:41] devil. don't uh don't dictate to us.
[1:16:44] Christ delivered us total deliverance.
[1:16:46] Delivered us from evil. Delivered us
[1:16:47] from sin. Delivered us from habits. Come
[1:16:50] on, somebody. Delivered us from from
[1:16:52] talking. Delivered us from from from
[1:16:54] black guard. Delivered us from all the
[1:16:56] kinds of smutty things. He totally
[1:16:58] delivered us and put us into his holy
[1:17:01] hands. A complete total deliverance.
[1:17:03] What can you say? Amen. Amen. The habits
[1:17:05] that you used to have. Amen. You don't
[1:17:08] have them anymore because you've been
[1:17:09] completely delivered. Amen. the
[1:17:11] unbelieving part of you that used to
[1:17:13] say, "Well, I don't have to follow the
[1:17:15] word and I don't have to." No, come on,
[1:17:17] somebody. We're we we're we we've
[1:17:18] surrendered ourselves and we are now
[1:17:21] being delivered of those things. And and
[1:17:23] I want to preach positive to you here
[1:17:25] for a moment because I realize that this
[1:17:27] may come across negative that that you
[1:17:29] need to surrender. But listen, it's not
[1:17:30] hard to surrender. We just have to give
[1:17:33] up and let Jesus take control of our
[1:17:36] lives. Can you say amen? Amen. We're
[1:17:38] not, Listen, church. This is not saying,
[1:17:40] "Well, well, well, if I didn't surrender
[1:17:41] yesterday, I'm a I'm a bad person." No,
[1:17:43] you're not a bad person. Amen. You're a
[1:17:45] good person. That's why he chose you to
[1:17:47] be in this bride. Amen. You're a special
[1:17:49] person. Come on, somebody. You're
[1:17:52] specially prepared to be in this end
[1:17:53] time bride. Don't let the devil tell you
[1:17:55] you're not enough. Amen. Don't let the
[1:17:57] devil rob you of your joy. Don't let the
[1:17:59] devil rob you. Come on, somebody. Don't
[1:18:02] let the devil rob you of your
[1:18:04] deliverance because deliverance has come
[1:18:06] to those he knew would accept
[1:18:08] deliverance. Well, come on, church.
[1:18:11] Listen. I know that the devil has come
[1:18:12] at you and tried to battle your mind and
[1:18:14] say, "Amen, that you're not good enough
[1:18:16] to be in this bride, but you're good
[1:18:18] enough or you wouldn't be here tonight."
[1:18:21] Amen. This is Listen, this is a positive
[1:18:23] gospel to the bride. Amen. It's like the
[1:18:25] man that had the book and the man took a
[1:18:27] book to his boss and said, "Read this
[1:18:28] book." He said he and the boss read it
[1:18:31] and he gave it back to him and he said
[1:18:33] the guy said, "What do you think of it?"
[1:18:34] He said, "Well, that man in that book
[1:18:36] called me a buzzer." He said, "That's
[1:18:37] funny, boss." He said, "That man in that
[1:18:38] book called me an eagle." Amen. I
[1:18:40] believe I if you're willing and and
[1:18:42] ready to submit to the word of God.
[1:18:44] Amen. This is not doom and gloom to you,
[1:18:46] but this is the word that is bringing
[1:18:48] you out and delivering you from
[1:18:50] everything that the world is trying to
[1:18:52] come against you. Come on, somebody. I
[1:18:55] know I know it's Wednesday night and I
[1:18:56] know sometimes we get tired on Wednesday
[1:18:58] nights and I know the devil tries to
[1:19:00] make it where we don't get nothing out
[1:19:01] of church, but let us surrender just a
[1:19:03] little bit of time to him and say,
[1:19:05] "Lord, come into the secret part of my
[1:19:07] heart tonight and move everything out
[1:19:09] that's holding me back from a
[1:19:10] deliverance here in this service." Amen.
[1:19:13] Take control of my being. Take control
[1:19:15] of my life. Take control of everything.
[1:19:18] Why? Because he knows what you need. Let
[1:19:20] us give everything we've got to him and
[1:19:23] let him take control. Amen. There's an
[1:19:25] old song says give up and let Jesus take
[1:19:27] over. And I believe tonight that's what
[1:19:29] we need to do. Just give up and let
[1:19:31] Jesus have control. Amen. We we we've
[1:19:34] done a pretty bad job of being control
[1:19:36] all this time. Brother Gabe, we might as
[1:19:37] well let him have the reigns for a while
[1:19:39] and say, "Lord, lead me and guide me.
[1:19:42] And I'm giving everything to you. I want
[1:19:44] our young people to come back filled
[1:19:46] with the Holy Ghost. And I want our
[1:19:47] homes to be filled with the Holy Ghost.
[1:19:49] And I want the token over them when we
[1:19:51] come home. Come on, church. What we need
[1:19:53] tonight is not just another religious
[1:19:54] ceremony. We don't just need another
[1:19:56] youth camp, but we need the fire baptism
[1:19:58] of the Holy Ghost to move into the lives
[1:20:01] of our young people and change
[1:20:02] everything that is wrong in their lives.
[1:20:05] Listen, I know as a parent, a man,
[1:20:07] there's going to come a time when you
[1:20:08] can't hold them any longer. But there's
[1:20:10] got to be something holding them young
[1:20:11] people. There's got to be something
[1:20:13] giving them strength for the journey.
[1:20:14] Amen. You can talk to him about it and
[1:20:16] you can preach to them about it and you
[1:20:18] can say all kind of good things in the
[1:20:20] home, but let me tell you what they need
[1:20:22] is they need an experience with God. And
[1:20:24] I think every young person, every old
[1:20:26] person, every every parent ought to be
[1:20:28] on their knees saying, "Lord, give every
[1:20:30] young person the Holy Ghost. Give them
[1:20:33] something that will sustain them on this
[1:20:35] journey because it's not just good
[1:20:37] enough to sit on a pew. It's not good
[1:20:39] enough to sit on the front pew. But
[1:20:41] they've got to have something that will
[1:20:43] hold them in this time of leodysia. I
[1:20:46] don't want to see another generation
[1:20:47] that is cold and indifferent. I don't
[1:20:49] want to see another generation grow up.
[1:20:51] Amen. That doesn't care about the things
[1:20:53] of God. But I want to see young people
[1:20:55] so on fire for God that it will that
[1:20:58] they they'll be moving in the service
[1:20:59] and when the word is preached, there'll
[1:21:01] be something on the inside of them
[1:21:03] crying out, "Lord, I want more of you.
[1:21:06] I'm surrendering to you." I I say every
[1:21:08] parent in the building ought to say,
[1:21:09] "Lord, give my children the Holy Ghost."
[1:21:11] And every parent in the building ought
[1:21:13] to say, "Lord, I I I want more of you
[1:21:15] myself." Every parent in the building
[1:21:17] ought to say, "I'm surrendering my home
[1:21:19] life." Amen. When my kid gets home from
[1:21:21] camp, I'm not going to just be be
[1:21:23] treating them like another kid, but I'm
[1:21:24] going to say, "I want to nurture that
[1:21:26] young man. I want to nurture that young
[1:21:28] woman. I want them to grow up to be
[1:21:30] believers of this end time message." And
[1:21:32] and not just not just pew warmers. Amen.
[1:21:35] But but young people on fire with the
[1:21:37] power of God on the inside of their
[1:21:39] vessels. I say that ought to be a prayer
[1:21:41] of every parent in the building. That
[1:21:43] ought to be a prayer of every member in
[1:21:44] this church. I say word of life. It's
[1:21:46] time that we start investing in our
[1:21:48] young people and say it's not good
[1:21:50] enough just to raise them. But we got to
[1:21:52] raise them in the fear and the
[1:21:53] admonition of the Lord. Come on church.
[1:21:55] I this is on my heart hard tonight. I
[1:21:57] want you to know something that that
[1:21:58] that if we don't raise them right at
[1:22:01] home. Amen. We're going to lose another
[1:22:02] generation of people that should be on
[1:22:04] fire for this message. Amen. There's
[1:22:06] going to be young preachers that are
[1:22:07] determined by the way your home life is.
[1:22:10] There's going to be young sisters that
[1:22:11] are well, can you say, "Amen. Is this
[1:22:13] okay tonight?" I think what we need to
[1:22:15] realize is it's not good enough to just
[1:22:17] bring them to church. But when they go
[1:22:19] home on Thursday morning or on Monday
[1:22:21] morning, Amen. There needs to be an
[1:22:22] atmosphere in that home where them
[1:22:24] children can grow, where they can
[1:22:26] listen, you say, "Well, anything can
[1:22:28] grow in an atmosphere." That's true. But
[1:22:30] do you believe these are sons and
[1:22:31] daughters of God? I do. I say so. Let's
[1:22:34] create an atmosphere and surrender what
[1:22:36] our wants are and our will is to help
[1:22:39] our young people grow in this message of
[1:22:42] the hour. I tell you, church, I I know I
[1:22:44] know a lot of times we we we get busy
[1:22:46] and and we get we say, "Well, we got all
[1:22:48] kinds of things. We want our kids
[1:22:50] involved in everything." Amen. But can
[1:22:51] you think of anything better for them to
[1:22:53] do than to be on fire for God?
[1:22:56] Amen. I I tell you, brother Brandham
[1:22:58] told brother Billy Paul one time,
[1:23:00] Brother Billy tells this, and I always
[1:23:01] thought it was pretty good. He said he,
[1:23:03] Brother Billy, he he said he wanted him
[1:23:05] to grow up to be a preacher or a doctor.
[1:23:08] Because he said he wanted to help
[1:23:09] somebody.
[1:23:11] And so, I'll just go ahead and say it
[1:23:12] tonight. I I I like to see young men on
[1:23:14] this front row grow up to be preachers
[1:23:16] of the gospel
[1:23:18] or doctors.
[1:23:20] But you know, in this time, I think we
[1:23:22] probably need preachers worse than we do
[1:23:23] doctors because it's a there's an attack
[1:23:26] on the spirit of the ages that we It's
[1:23:28] like we don't want young men to grow up
[1:23:30] and preach the gospel no more. I say
[1:23:32] let's get behind them and and pull for
[1:23:34] the gift of God in their life. Amen. We
[1:23:36] need some young sisters that can grow up
[1:23:38] a and be and be staples in this message
[1:23:40] and dress the word. And listen, church,
[1:23:43] it it I think it's later than we're
[1:23:45] we're get than we're thinking. I think
[1:23:47] we need to lay aside all the things that
[1:23:49] are holding us back and surrender our
[1:23:51] lives as parents so that our children
[1:23:53] will have a chance in this end time. Can
[1:23:56] you say amen? I hope that's okay. But
[1:23:59] it's on my heart tonight that we've got
[1:24:01] to surrender our own way or we're going
[1:24:03] to be the cause of a loss in our young
[1:24:05] people.
[1:24:08] Brother will go on like this. He
[1:24:10] delivered us from sickness for we have
[1:24:11] an abstract deed to that. He was wounded
[1:24:13] for our transgressions. With his stripes
[1:24:15] we are healed. He's our healer. He said,
[1:24:17] "That's why the little pully old woman
[1:24:19] trying to take care of a cancer dying
[1:24:20] husband. She walked into the realms in
[1:24:22] the presence of God, she had faith. The
[1:24:24] doctors had done all they could do. She
[1:24:25] followed God's instructions and was
[1:24:27] totally delivered." The disciples had
[1:24:30] total deliverance. Absolutely total
[1:24:31] deliverance. Why? Because they were
[1:24:33] completely and totally filled with the
[1:24:35] Holy Ghost. He said, "When you just a
[1:24:37] church member and shook the pastor's
[1:24:38] hands or some kind of a little
[1:24:40] experience of jumping, shouting, or
[1:24:41] speaking in tongues or something
[1:24:42] another, and still have malice in your
[1:24:44] heart, strange acts, telling lies,
[1:24:46] smoking cigarettes, lusting after women,
[1:24:48] there is something hasn't happened yet.
[1:24:50] There's something wrong. For he that
[1:24:51] loves the world or the things of the
[1:24:53] world, the love of God is not in him.
[1:24:54] You've been misled. By their fruits, you
[1:24:56] shall know them." He said, "We all want
[1:24:58] to be unified together with the Holy
[1:25:00] Spirit. Every member should be unified
[1:25:03] one with the other. The love of God is
[1:25:05] shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy
[1:25:07] Ghost. It cleanses us from all
[1:25:09] unrighteousness. We are delivered from
[1:25:11] the things of the world. Jesus said,
[1:25:12] "This will all men know that you're my
[1:25:14] disciples when you got love one for the
[1:25:16] other." Are you still with me tonight?
[1:25:17] He said, "When one member loves the
[1:25:19] other members so much that it would die
[1:25:20] for it when one evil thing starts
[1:25:22] outside the outside world, some of the
[1:25:24] women come along and say, "Now look,
[1:25:26] dear, it would be better if you did this
[1:25:28] or that or the other or did that or done
[1:25:29] this and got all away from that bunch of
[1:25:31] holy rollers and so forth like that." We
[1:25:33] are so unified with God. You say, "Well,
[1:25:35] Brother Brandham, it's an awful
[1:25:36] temptation, but Christ died for that
[1:25:39] purpose. The devil is defeated."
[1:25:41] Somebody say, "The devil's defeated."
[1:25:44] We want total deliverance. I'm saying
[1:25:46] what a prophet's saying now. He said,
[1:25:48] "We want total deliverance. We want a
[1:25:51] church that's pure and clean and
[1:25:54] unadulterated and washed in the blood of
[1:25:56] the lamb and filled with the Holy Spirit
[1:25:59] and signs and wonders and miracles." You
[1:26:01] say, "Brother Joel, I want that kind of
[1:26:03] church." Then what we need tonight is a
[1:26:05] total s surrender so that we can have,
[1:26:08] amen, a complete deliverance. Listen,
[1:26:11] church, what we need tonight, we've got
[1:26:12] to empty out what we are so that the
[1:26:15] Holy Spirit can fill our whole vessel.
[1:26:18] Can you say amen? Brother Rand would say
[1:26:20] it like this. I don't have the quote in
[1:26:21] front of me. He said, "When it" He said,
[1:26:22] "When the emptying out comes, that's
[1:26:24] when there comes a filling." Amen. When
[1:26:26] you can empty out everything that you
[1:26:28] think or everything that you want,
[1:26:29] everything that you think is how
[1:26:31] everything ought to be. Empty all that
[1:26:33] out and then let the Holy Ghost come in
[1:26:35] and fill that vessel. It'll make you
[1:26:36] walk different, act different. Come on,
[1:26:38] church. I know you're carrying around a
[1:26:40] sticky nature, but we need the water of
[1:26:42] the Holy Ghost on us to change our lives
[1:26:44] and make us act different here in the
[1:26:46] house of God. Amen. I think we owe it to
[1:26:48] our young people. I think we owe it to
[1:26:50] our young people to surrender our homes.
[1:26:51] I think we owe it to our young people to
[1:26:53] surrender our lives. Can you say amen? I
[1:26:56] think we owe it to our young people to
[1:26:57] be better Christians in front of them
[1:26:59] and start showing that we're not just
[1:27:01] we're not just make believers, but we're
[1:27:03] real true believers of this message.
[1:27:05] Amen. We don't have to preach them a
[1:27:07] message so much as live a message in
[1:27:08] front of them and watch their lives
[1:27:10] change. They be like, "I want to be like
[1:27:12] that." Amen. When your when your son can
[1:27:14] say, "I want to be like dad." Or your
[1:27:15] daughter says, "I want to be just like
[1:27:17] mom." Listen, that's that's the change
[1:27:18] you want to see in your life. Can you
[1:27:22] say amen? Brother Brandon will go on
[1:27:24] down like this. And I'm coming to a
[1:27:25] close. If our hearts condemn us, we want
[1:27:28] complete deliverance.
[1:27:31] Amen. You ever come to church and
[1:27:33] something condemns you in your heart?
[1:27:36] You know that don't have to be there.
[1:27:38] Repent of it and you can have complete
[1:27:40] deliverance. He said, "We don't want to
[1:27:42] be a halfway church."
[1:27:45] Brother Stewart preached a sermon here
[1:27:46] not long ago and just it stirred my
[1:27:48] heart. He said, "There's no time for
[1:27:49] playing church." And it made me think of
[1:27:52] that when I was reading listening to
[1:27:53] this message. Brother Brandon preaches a
[1:27:55] total deliverance in 1959. And if you'll
[1:27:58] listen to that, I know there's a real
[1:27:59] long introduction to it, but if you'll
[1:28:00] go down there where he starts the
[1:28:01] scriptures and he and he talks a lot of
[1:28:03] these quotes are from that sermon and
[1:28:05] man, he talks about how we need a
[1:28:07] complete surrender so that we can be
[1:28:09] delivered. And he calls it a total
[1:28:11] deliverance. But he says this in that
[1:28:12] message. He says he says we ought we
[1:28:14] want to be real Christians or no
[1:28:15] Christians at all. We want total
[1:28:17] deliverance from our habits, from our
[1:28:18] sins, from our evil thinking, from our
[1:28:20] evil doing, from our negligence. Oh,
[1:28:24] somebody say amen tonight. From our
[1:28:26] negligence, whatever we've done, we want
[1:28:28] total deliverance so that when people
[1:28:31] come into this church to be prayed for,
[1:28:33] there will be just this little group,
[1:28:34] maybe not over a hundred or two, he
[1:28:36] said, sitting here, but they'll be
[1:28:37] completely in the hands of God. And when
[1:28:40] we pray, then God will hear from heaven.
[1:28:43] And so I say tonight, if you want to,
[1:28:45] you say, "Well, I'm not getting the
[1:28:46] healing I want or I'm not having the joy
[1:28:48] that I want." Come on church, what we
[1:28:50] need is a surrender tonight and you can
[1:28:53] have whatever you have need of here in
[1:28:55] the house of God. I say for our young
[1:28:57] people that's going to camp. Amen.
[1:28:58] Surrender your heart. Amen. Don't go
[1:29:00] there with with expectations. Well, if
[1:29:02] it was like this camp or that camp, no,
[1:29:03] no, just surrender your heart. Amen. It
[1:29:05] is not to see how the building is or
[1:29:07] what everything looks like, but what is
[1:29:09] there you're there for one thing, and
[1:29:11] that is to meet God with a surrendered
[1:29:13] heart so that you can be changed. Can
[1:29:16] you say amen? Amen. God wants a people
[1:29:19] that is not too big to get down at an
[1:29:21] altar. It's not too big to say, "Lord,
[1:29:23] I'm sorry." We're not too big to say, "I
[1:29:25] was wrong." Amen. We're not too big to
[1:29:27] surrender ourselves and be totally
[1:29:30] delivered. Can you say, "Amen." Amen. I
[1:29:33] know. I know it's Wednesday. I'm almost
[1:29:34] done. Y'all still with me? You've been
[1:29:36] good to preach to tonight. Amen. Just a
[1:29:38] few more minutes and I'll close. Brother
[1:29:40] Brandon was talking about Sister Rosella
[1:29:42] Griffin. I How many's ever Griffith? How
[1:29:44] many's ever met her? Brother Danny.
[1:29:46] Amen. Brother Herold. Amen. I Brother
[1:29:47] Harvey. Amen. Several of you have met
[1:29:48] her. I I was privileged to meet her not
[1:29:51] long before she passed. She was in a
[1:29:52] wheelchair down in Georgia. And it made
[1:29:54] me actually when I was thinking of this
[1:29:56] tonight, I she came on my mind. And
[1:29:59] Brother Brandham talks about Sister
[1:30:00] Rosella. Brother Ram said she was one of
[1:30:03] the biggest alcoholics Chicago had.
[1:30:05] Skidro had nothing on Rosella. She came
[1:30:08] to the Hammond meetings there and and
[1:30:09] there the Holy Spirit called her out and
[1:30:11] told her all about it. She was delivered
[1:30:13] from that alcoholism and now she works
[1:30:15] the jails and things and with other
[1:30:17] alcoholics and and he and he calls her
[1:30:19] out in the building and there she is. He
[1:30:20] says a lovely person who gave her life
[1:30:22] and surrendered herself to Christ. And
[1:30:24] he said now and he said when I seen her
[1:30:26] come on the platform he says excuse me
[1:30:28] Sister Rosella. She was a bad eyed,
[1:30:30] wretched looking witch.
[1:30:33] This a woman need deliverance.
[1:30:36] This woman needed deliverance. He said
[1:30:37] she was just a badl looking woman and
[1:30:40] wretched looking witch to see her. Oh,
[1:30:41] he said, "You've never seen such a
[1:30:43] looking person." He said, "And I" He
[1:30:45] said, "I don't say this to flatter, but
[1:30:46] Rosella tonight is a lovely, beautiful
[1:30:48] young woman. She's 15 years younger. Uh
[1:30:51] she's 15 years uh uh younger looking
[1:30:53] than what she really is, and she's a
[1:30:55] lovely person and never uh took a drink
[1:30:57] of alcohol since." And when the hospital
[1:30:59] after hospital and doctor after doctor
[1:31:01] alcoholics anonymous of Chicago all of
[1:31:03] them give her up and and hopeless case
[1:31:06] and there she sets tonight after years
[1:31:08] and years amazing grace he said how
[1:31:10] sweet the sound that saves a rest like
[1:31:12] me. Listen what it was was a person that
[1:31:14] had gone so far and had gotten so low
[1:31:17] that all they had left was a surrender
[1:31:19] themselves to Jesus. And let me tell you
[1:31:21] something. He can take the worst
[1:31:23] situation and make it a new situation.
[1:31:25] Amen. He can take the worst problem in
[1:31:27] your life and he can make it a blessing
[1:31:29] for you. Amen. He can take a person that
[1:31:31] was such a bad alcoholic, amen, that
[1:31:33] even it messed up her face and and
[1:31:35] changed the way she looked and turned
[1:31:37] her into a beautiful young lady in the
[1:31:39] gospel. Let me tell you something. God
[1:31:41] is still the God of the impossible. God
[1:31:44] is still greater than any sin that
[1:31:46] you've committed. God is still greater
[1:31:48] than every situation that you went
[1:31:50] through. If he's still God, then we
[1:31:52] ought to worship him because tonight he
[1:31:55] has changed my life. He's delivered me
[1:31:57] from evil. Even though you walk through
[1:31:59] the valley of the shadow of death. Amen.
[1:32:01] He said, "I will fear no evil for thou
[1:32:03] art with me." Why? Why? Because he's
[1:32:05] there to deliver you out of that evil
[1:32:08] situation. Come on, church. I think we
[1:32:10] ought to just go ahead and say, you know
[1:32:12] what? The devil is a liar. And we
[1:32:14] believe God is truth. I'm not
[1:32:16] surrendering to the devil, but I've
[1:32:18] surrendered my life to Jesus. And now I
[1:32:21] am an heir to every promise in the book.
[1:32:24] Every promise in the open book is mine.
[1:32:26] Every promise in that message is mine.
[1:32:28] Why? Because I've surrendered my life to
[1:32:31] it. Everything the message is, I would
[1:32:33] say I am. Amen. I'm not just live. I'm
[1:32:35] not just talking about a message, but I
[1:32:37] want to surrender myself and live what
[1:32:40] the message has called me to live in
[1:32:42] this hour. Listen church, my time's up,
[1:32:44] but I want to just say this. Amen.
[1:32:46] Pharaoh want he he said one time he said
[1:32:48] he said Moses, you can go, but you got
[1:32:50] to leave your children behind or leave
[1:32:52] some of your cattle behind. And Pharaoh
[1:32:54] wanted to bargain with him. Amen. But do
[1:32:55] you realize something? Brother Brandham
[1:32:57] said, "That's the way the devil wants a
[1:32:59] Christian to come. It'll be all right
[1:33:00] for you to join the church, but don't
[1:33:02] you never forgive Jones. It'll be all
[1:33:04] right if you can. You don't have to give
[1:33:06] up your smoking or your drinking or your
[1:33:07] lying or your stealing or your fa faultf
[1:33:09] finding and backbiting." Well, can you
[1:33:10] imagine? And he put that right in there
[1:33:11] with drinking and smoking.
[1:33:14] Come on, church. Amen. We've let these
[1:33:16] little things hinder our services long
[1:33:18] enough. We've let these little foxes
[1:33:20] spoil the vine long enough. It's time we
[1:33:23] give it to Jesus and let him take over.
[1:33:27] Y'all okay. Amen. He said, "Your fault
[1:33:29] finding your backbiting. You don't have
[1:33:31] to give that up. Just join the church."
[1:33:32] But Moses Moses wasn't a compromiser. He
[1:33:35] wanted a complete deliverance. He said,
[1:33:37] "We'll not leave one hoof behind. We'll
[1:33:39] take everything that belongs to us when
[1:33:41] we go to worship the Lord. That's the
[1:33:43] way the church ought to be. We'll take
[1:33:44] righteousness. We'll take holiness.
[1:33:46] We'll take the Holy Spirit. We'll take a
[1:33:48] unified group when we go to the altar.
[1:33:50] We'll be a real group. We'll leave
[1:33:52] nothing behind. We'll take everything.
[1:33:54] There won't be one hoof. Stay back. He
[1:33:56] said, you know, and people can pray in
[1:33:58] such a way till the devil will have to
[1:34:00] give in. I would say for those of you
[1:34:02] that may not be a camp, pray in such a
[1:34:04] way till the devil cannot hold our young
[1:34:07] people no longer. The devil can't have
[1:34:09] one of them because we're not leaving
[1:34:11] one hoof behind. We're not leaving
[1:34:14] nobody. We're taking everything that God
[1:34:16] has promised us. Lord, as the musicians
[1:34:19] come, can you say, "Praise the Lord."
[1:34:21] Aren't you glad for the message of the
[1:34:23] hour that tells you you don't have to
[1:34:24] give in to one devil? You don't have to
[1:34:27] give up on one promise.
[1:34:29] Not one of them. We are more than able
[1:34:32] to take the land because we have been
[1:34:34] given a a message of authority.
[1:34:38] Can you say amen? Brother man would say
[1:34:40] this. I want to read this one just as in
[1:34:42] closing.
[1:34:44] He said,
[1:34:46] "Well, you see, the devil will tell you
[1:34:50] that you're going to lose some good
[1:34:52] time. You're going to lose some
[1:34:54] privileges, but he's lying to
[1:34:57] you. Especially you young people."
[1:35:00] Brother Brandham said, I put this quote
[1:35:02] in here just for you young people. I
[1:35:03] want you to pay attention for just a
[1:35:04] minute. The devil's going to tell you
[1:35:06] you'll lose a good time. You're going to
[1:35:08] lose some privileges. But he's lying to
[1:35:11] you. Especially you young people. He
[1:35:14] said, "Now," he said, "Oh my, you don't
[1:35:17] have to drink. You don't have to smoke.
[1:35:18] You don't have to run around in these
[1:35:20] places of amusement. Why? The Holy
[1:35:22] Spirit is a million times better than
[1:35:25] all the devil could even offer you."
[1:35:28] Now, can somebody say, "Praise the
[1:35:30] Lord."
[1:35:31] He said the devil's the the Holy Spirit
[1:35:33] is a million times better than all the
[1:35:35] devil could even offer you. Why? You
[1:35:36] don't have to get drunk on the strong
[1:35:38] drink to have a big time. Sinners do
[1:35:40] that. But you don't have to do that.
[1:35:42] Because he said, "I'm 23 years of
[1:35:44] preaching and I've been drunk the whole
[1:35:46] 23 years. I'm the Holy
[1:35:48] Spirit." Come on, church. You know, we
[1:35:51] get a little weird when people get under
[1:35:52] this under the anointing and and they're
[1:35:54] just getting blessed. I say, "Let the
[1:35:55] young people have a blessing." I say,
[1:35:58] "Let the old people get blessed again.
[1:36:00] Let's have a blessing again." I'm not
[1:36:02] going to I'm not going to condemn
[1:36:03] somebody for acting funny in the house
[1:36:04] of God that they're drunk on the Holy
[1:36:07] Ghost. Let them have a good time in
[1:36:10] church. He said, "You don't have to get
[1:36:12] drunk on strong drink to have a big
[1:36:15] time because I've been drinking." He
[1:36:17] said, "23 years I'm drunk on the Holy
[1:36:19] Spirit. It's a stimulation in itself and
[1:36:22] it never lets up." Aren't you thankful
[1:36:25] for that? It never lets up. Brother
[1:36:28] David, it gets sweeter and sweeter and
[1:36:32] better. Come on, church. Brother Paul,
[1:36:34] you've been serving the Lord some time
[1:36:36] now, but it gets better.
[1:36:39] Brother Danny, you've been in it a long
[1:36:40] time, but let it gets better. These men
[1:36:43] can testify to you young people. Brother
[1:36:44] Herald, you can testify. It ain't always
[1:36:46] a better roses, but the life of a
[1:36:49] Christian, it gets better and better
[1:36:50] because you know that when I come to the
[1:36:52] end of my journey, I know where I'm
[1:36:54] going. I know where I'm headed and I'm
[1:36:57] not giving up now because God has called
[1:36:59] me for such a time as this.
[1:37:02] He called our elders to be examples for
[1:37:04] this young generation. I'm so thankful
[1:37:06] for every one of them. I can look at
[1:37:08] their faithfulness and they don't have
[1:37:10] the negligence. What is it? It's it's
[1:37:12] it's a life that they may have been
[1:37:15] through some things to bring them here,
[1:37:16] but they're here.
[1:37:19] I say, Lord, help me to be that next
[1:37:21] elder in the message. Somebody's got to
[1:37:23] be that next generation. Come on.
[1:37:25] Somebody's got to be that person that
[1:37:26] will endure sound doctrine. Somebody's
[1:37:29] got to be somebody say, "I'm going to
[1:37:30] stand for this message until the day I
[1:37:32] die. No matter who fails me, no matter
[1:37:34] who walks away, I'm here to stay." Why?
[1:37:37] Because God has given me the authority
[1:37:39] to live in this
[1:37:41] hour. Brother would go on like this. He
[1:37:43] said, he said, "I've always got joy,
[1:37:46] always got peace, always feel good."
[1:37:50] Now, there's faith talking there.
[1:37:53] Yeah.
[1:37:56] He said, "If I'm sick in body, he's got
[1:37:59] me happy in my soul. If things are going
[1:38:01] good, things are going good in my soul
[1:38:03] and bad in my body or vice versa, it
[1:38:05] makes any difference. God is always
[1:38:08] there and I'm always stimulated with a
[1:38:13] pleasure that's joy unspeakable and full
[1:38:16] of glory. That's what he does for the
[1:38:19] believer. I hope you all are okay
[1:38:21] tonight. But I just want to tell you
[1:38:22] something. There there's a joy on the
[1:38:24] inside of this believer that on your
[1:38:26] worst Wednesday night when you're so
[1:38:27] tired you couldn't hardly make it,
[1:38:29] there's a joy on the inside of you that
[1:38:31] is still pressing on. There's a joy on
[1:38:34] the inside of you. Listen, church, you
[1:38:36] know, the journey's just the the journey
[1:38:38] gets long and the journey gets hard. But
[1:38:41] are you satisfied with what God has
[1:38:43] given us in this generation? He's given
[1:38:45] us sustainability. He's given us mana
[1:38:48] for the journey. He's given us what we
[1:38:50] have need of a to overcome a leotardian
[1:38:53] spirit. He's given you young people.
[1:38:55] He's given you the word of God. And he's
[1:38:58] given you the anointing. And listen to
[1:39:00] me. He's given you the word to walk all
[1:39:02] over the devils that are going to try to
[1:39:04] hinder you in this day. Young people, I
[1:39:06] say it's time to surrender so that you
[1:39:08] can be totally delivered. I say this
[1:39:11] weekend is a time for deliverance. But
[1:39:13] can we surrender tonight so that when
[1:39:15] you go into this weekend, you can say,
[1:39:16] "Lord, I've surrendered everything to
[1:39:18] you. I've surrendered my my preconceived
[1:39:21] ideas of how camp's got to go or or or
[1:39:23] who I've got to bunk with or how I come
[1:39:25] on, church, how much sleep I'm going to
[1:39:27] get, but I've given it all to him
[1:39:30] because I want to be delivered from
[1:39:32] everything that's causing me to not live
[1:39:34] the full Christian life." These young
[1:39:37] people, I know they're young, but you
[1:39:38] know, it's time now when they got to
[1:39:40] start making decisions. Think back when
[1:39:43] you was 13, 14, 15, 16 years old. You
[1:39:46] know, the devil started working on your
[1:39:47] mind and started getting you to look at
[1:39:50] the world and look how good it looks.
[1:39:52] Come on, somebody. But you know, it's
[1:39:55] just pleasure for a season and then the
[1:39:57] end of it is death. But this Christian
[1:39:59] life, it may be a struggle even for a
[1:40:01] season, but the end of it is eternal
[1:40:03] life. So I say, "Let me walk with you,
[1:40:06] Jesus. Don't ever leave me alone. For
[1:40:09] without him, I could never make
[1:40:12] heaven. I could never make heaven. But
[1:40:15] I've surrendered every step to
[1:40:18] him. Can the church say amen? Can you
[1:40:21] stand
[1:40:21] [Music]
[1:40:24] together? If there's a need on your
[1:40:26] heart
[1:40:27] tonight, if you want to just make a
[1:40:29] surrender, you know, Brother Bam said
[1:40:31] raising your hands is a sign of a sign
[1:40:33] of
[1:40:34] surrender. It's a sign of surrender.
[1:40:38] And I'm going to just go out on a limb
[1:40:40] here and say that if there's a person in
[1:40:41] this building tonight that has breath in
[1:40:43] their body, there's something in your
[1:40:45] life you need to
[1:40:47] surrender. There's something you need to
[1:40:48] give to Jesus tonight so that he can
[1:40:51] take full control of your life. I wonder
[1:40:55] if there's one here tonight that says,
[1:40:56] "I I want to I want to surrender. I want
[1:40:59] to surrender so that I can be delivered.
[1:41:01] I want to surrender everything that is
[1:41:03] holding me from my full potential.
[1:41:07] I wonder if you just bow your heads
[1:41:08] tonight. Every eye closed, every head
[1:41:10] bowed. Think about that secret place.
[1:41:13] Invite him into your home tonight and
[1:41:15] say, "Every room is yours. Every
[1:41:20] closet, every every little
[1:41:23] corner, every inch of my home is yours.
[1:41:26] Move into my
[1:41:29] heart. Make me more like you. Give me a
[1:41:33] life. Give me a heart that's filled with
[1:41:35] love.
[1:41:37] make me more like you. Fill me. I wonder
[1:41:41] if there's a young person here says,
[1:41:43] "Lord, I I I've got to surrender. I I
[1:41:46] I've been thinking of the wrong things.
[1:41:48] I've been doing the wrong things. I've
[1:41:50] been holding back long enough. I want to
[1:41:53] surrender everything to Jesus. He's
[1:41:56] worthy of my time. He's worthy of my
[1:41:58] life."
[1:41:59] He paid the ultimate price so that we
[1:42:01] could come tonight and raise our hands
[1:42:03] and say, "You are
[1:42:05] worthy. I'm a sinner, but I'm saved by
[1:42:09] his
[1:42:10] grace." And it was grace that brought me
[1:42:12] this far. I wonder if you can just talk
[1:42:14] to him for a moment right where you're
[1:42:15] sitting. If you need to bow at the
[1:42:17] altar, you can. I don't want to rush you
[1:42:18] tonight. I'm I'm sorry I've taken a
[1:42:20] little bit too much time, but this was
[1:42:22] on my heart. I want you young people
[1:42:23] just really think about this weekend.
[1:42:25] Don't go just to have it's good to have
[1:42:27] a good time at camp, but go and say,
[1:42:29] "Lord, deliver
[1:42:31] me completely. Deliver me. Empty me out
[1:42:34] so that I can be filled with your
[1:42:38] spirit." Just pray to him there tonight.
[1:42:51] If not for grace, where would I
[1:42:55] be? Where would I
[1:42:59] be? You only
[1:43:04] know. I'm glad you
[1:43:07] [Music]
[1:43:08] see through
[1:43:10] eyes of
[1:43:12] love. I was a whole. Oh, you ever been
[1:43:17] there? An
[1:43:19] empty
[1:43:21] place. If
[1:43:24] not,
[1:43:26] grace. Amazing
[1:43:28] [Applause]
[1:43:30] grace. How sweet the sound. Can you
[1:43:34] testify? You were lost, but you're
[1:43:37] found. Oh, yes.
[1:43:40] But
[1:43:43] now I was a hope. Yes, I
[1:43:48] was an
[1:43:51] empty. Oh
[1:43:52] yes, if not for grace. Oh precious Lord.
[1:43:58] Oh precious
[1:44:01] Lord, please take my
[1:44:05] hand. Oh, lead me on.
[1:44:11] and let me
[1:44:14] stand. I was a hopeless
[1:44:19] case, an
[1:44:21] empty
[1:44:23] place. If not, I'll sing it
[1:44:28] again. Where would I
[1:44:30] [Music]
[1:44:32] be? You only
[1:44:36] know. I'm glad you
[1:44:41] see through eyes of
[1:44:44] love. Oh, I was a whole. Oh yes, we
[1:44:50] were an
[1:44:52] empty
[1:44:54] place if
[1:44:56] not for
[1:45:00] grace. Thank you. Thank you
[1:45:08] [Music]
[1:45:09] Jesus for the
[1:45:14] [Music]
[1:45:18] grace though I can't
[1:45:21] compare from my heart I'd like to
[1:45:26] say oh can we just say thank you tonight
[1:45:29] I wonder if we can put our hands up to
[1:45:30] him oh say it one more time I I want to
[1:45:34] say
[1:45:36] thank. Oh, thank you
[1:45:43] Jesus for the grace that you
[1:45:48] have. Oh yes. So just keep singing it
[1:45:52] now. Oh, I can't

[1:47:58] Jesus for the grace that you
[1:48:02] have given
[1:48:05] [Music]
[1:48:09] us.
[1:48:11] Oh, I'd like to say
[1:48:16] that. Oh, I thank you.
[1:48:20] Can you give the Lord a hand clap of
[1:48:22] praise
[1:48:23] tonight? Man, have you
[1:48:25] surrendered? Have you surrendered
[1:48:27] tonight? If you surrender everything to
[1:48:30] him, you know, he's he's promised us a
[1:48:32] deliverance. If there's anything you you
[1:48:34] know, Brother Robert, come up here for
[1:48:35] prayer. church. We sometimes you just
[1:48:38] got to you just got to an act of faith
[1:48:41] is surrendering to God and saying, "You
[1:48:44] know what? I if I surrender to his word
[1:48:46] and I call for the elders of the church
[1:48:47] to lay hands on the sick, then you got
[1:48:49] to believe that the deliverance of they
[1:48:51] shall recover will come." Brother Paul,
[1:48:53] you've seen God work in your life.
[1:48:54] Brother Danny, some of you elders,
[1:48:56] you've seen God work in your life. I
[1:48:57] want to tell you this testimony, Brother
[1:48:59] Robert, just real quick. I I was in
[1:49:01] Arizona and on Sunday night there's
[1:49:03] these two sisters that come up to me and
[1:49:05] I had I was preaching there in December
[1:49:07] and and I had told sister Jessica's
[1:49:10] testimony of hair loss and she had to
[1:49:12] start wearing that hat to cover the hair
[1:49:13] loss and she come up for prayer and you
[1:49:16] know it was just like within a week or
[1:49:17] so later her hair started coming back
[1:49:20] and I I didn't even have a reason. I
[1:49:21] wasn't even preaching about healing, but
[1:49:23] I I I incl I I I said that out there at
[1:49:25] a meeting. And two sisters come up to me
[1:49:27] Sunday night. And and listen, this is
[1:49:29] not about me, but it's just about how
[1:49:31] the Lord can speak to people's hearts.
[1:49:32] And and and so these two sisters, both
[1:49:34] of them come up to me before we left the
[1:49:36] church on Sunday night, and they said,
[1:49:38] "When you told that testimony," and both
[1:49:40] these sisters came up for prayer that
[1:49:41] night, they came up and both of them
[1:49:44] their hair had started to grow back out.
[1:49:46] Both of them were healed in that
[1:49:48] service. Listen, it's not a man that can
[1:49:49] do it, but it's a surrender and then
[1:49:51] believe that God will do and keep his
[1:49:54] word. Come on, church. We We're living
[1:49:56] below our privileges. If you have a
[1:49:58] need, surrender and let God take control
[1:50:01] of your situation here tonight. I say,
[1:50:03] let's just go ahead and surrender to
[1:50:04] him. One more time. Say, "Thank you,
[1:50:06] Jesus, for the grace that you've given
[1:50:08] us." Every one of us have received it or
[1:50:09] we wouldn't be here
[1:50:12] tonight. Thank you. Oh, thank you,
[1:50:16] Jesus. Oh, can we just tell him thanks
[1:50:19] for just a few more
[1:50:20] moments? Oh, for the grace that you
[1:50:25] have given
[1:50:27] us. Oh
[1:50:29] yes. Though I can't
[1:50:32] repay from my heart, I'd like to say
[1:50:37] that
[1:50:39] I I
[1:50:41] thank you one more time. I thank you.
[1:50:47] thing. Oh, thank you
[1:50:52] [Music]
[1:50:54] Jesus for the grace that you
[1:50:59] have
[1:51:01] [Music]
[1:51:06] [Applause]
[1:51:14] given you. Can you give the Lord praise
[1:51:19] tonight? Do you believe God is real? Can
[1:51:21] we sing my God is
[1:51:23] real? Well, there are some
[1:51:27] things I may not
[1:51:31] know. There are some
[1:51:34] places I just don't
[1:51:39] go. But I am sure, yes I am, of this one
[1:51:46] thing that God is real. For I can feel
[1:51:52] deep in my
[1:51:53] soul. Oh my God is
[1:51:58] real. He's real in my soul. You believe
[1:52:01] it? Oh my God is real. For he has washed
[1:52:07] and made me whole.
[1:52:10] Oh, his love for
[1:52:13] me is like pure
[1:52:17] gold. My God is real, for I can't feel
[1:52:22] him in my
[1:52:24] soul. Some folks may doubt, but not us.
[1:52:29] Some folks may
[1:52:32] scorn or they can all go
[1:52:35] on and leave me
[1:52:40] alone. But as for me, how about you
[1:52:43] tonight? Oh, I'll take God's
[1:52:47] part for God is real and I can feel him
[1:52:52] in my

[1:53:17] gold. My God is real. For I can feel him
[1:53:22] in my
[1:53:24] soul. Well, I cannot
[1:53:28] tell just how it
[1:53:32] fell when Jesus took your sins all away.
[1:53:39] But I like this part. Ever since that
[1:53:42] day, can you testify about it? Oh, since
[1:53:45] that
[1:53:47] hour, oh my God is real. For I can feel
[1:53:52] his holy power.

[1:57:53] well, I didn't have a doubt. I knew that
[1:57:57] the Lord would bring me
[1:58:00] out. So, I got down on my knees. I said,
