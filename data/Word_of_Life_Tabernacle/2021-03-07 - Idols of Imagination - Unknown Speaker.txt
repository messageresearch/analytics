with your children you never wanted to be distant to be pushed away sin did that but lord we're so grateful for a redeemer when we were lost and across the chasm unable to to fellowship with you lord you came and wrapped yourself in a body of flesh came down and lived among us lived and died on the cross was raised again on the third day for our sins and because of that lord we can have fellowship with you today we're so grateful for that lord we thank you for that closeness that we feel i pray that it would be ever so in our lives may there be nothing come between us lord we want to worship

to add my prayers lord with the church father that you would meet every one of these needs lord we believe that you're a real god lord and that you're working today i don't know how you're going to do it but i know that you will lord and so we trust you today to meet every one of these needs and we believe it father thank you for being in this place in jesus name amen amen god bless you turn with me if you would to romans chapter we'll read verses 18 through 25. i want to get right into the word this morning of course we'll have our communion service this afternoon and i'll probably finish up on this thought this morning so don't judge me completely on this sermon we'll finish it up this afternoon and and just not hold you long but we'll have communion as well romans 1 18 for the wrath of god is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men who hold the truth in unrighteousness because that which may be known of god is manifest in them for god has showed it unto them so paul is telling us that all men are guilty in that way all of us had an opportunity in some way to see god and to recognize him as god he said for the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen being understood by the things that are made even his eternal power in godhead so that they are without excuse because that when they knew god they glorified him not as god neither were thankful but become vain in their imaginations and their foolish heart was darkened professing themselves to be wise they became fools and changed the glory of the uncorruptable god into an image made like to corruptable man to birds and four-footed beasts and creeping things wherefore god also gave them up to uncleanness through the lust of their own heart to dishonor their own bodies between themselves and change the truth of god into a lie and worshiped and served the creature more than the creator who was blessed forever amen i pray that god would add his blessing to the word you may be seated this morning every false god is a manifestation of the imagination of the man who created him there's been many gods in history and i want to title this this morning and this afternoon idols of imagination just to give you a few examples of the many gods that have been in history some of the stranger ones there was a god the romans had was cardea who was the goddess of hinges literally the goddess of door hinges the vikings had a god called ceremony who was the viking god of eternal bacon and that's a god some of us could serve right there every the story goes that in their imagination they'd made up a story where this pig was a god and every night he would be slaughtered by the other gods and they'd eat him and he'd show up again the next morning he was the god of eternal bacon one that we actually is in our language today there was a roman god called terminus who was the god of boundaries and if you have an easement on your property on real property it always almost usually goes back to a terminus point and that's where that comes from he was the god of boundaries and he was always after people who would move mild post on the road and so they had a god for everything and the haitians had a god of intersections he always stood at the intersections of roads he was always creating trouble the greeks had a god that i think is probably still around today epimetheus was the greek god of excuses i think he's still out there somewhere and you know we can laugh at that because it's silly but come out of somebody's mind somebody had to dream this up right it was imaginations and the word imaginations comes from a latin word which comes from the word image it's image it's to create an image is what an imagination is it's to create an image in your mind that's something that's not true or may not be real and so your imagination creates you know you read a book and your imagination creates an image of what that book is but it's not exactly maybe what it is at all we have an imagination of it it's building onto the words and and that's what every idol is made out of imaginations whether it's a god of boundaries or of intersections or of excuses or or god today that we create in our own mind who we think to be the god of heaven jehovah we think to be the god of the message of the hour and i want to not be too i don't want to come down too hard today but because i'm not coming down on you i just want to preach the word i don't want to make it sound like i'm hammering you today but but we need to be careful what gods we create out of our imagination to make sure that they didn't leave anything out the greeks come up with a god it was called the unknown god he was the god of everything they forgot to mention it was a placeholder god it was used for everything they hadn't thought up yet and they started worshiping him after athens was hit by a plague and no matter how many animals they soldered because that was their answer to a plague jt if something bad happened they just soldered an animal i'm so glad we have a greater sacrifice than that aren't you but but they would solder an animal and so they soldered sheep and they got to where they slaughtered thousands of sheep and the plague was still there so they said there must be some god we're not satisfying because they would take the animal to the altar of the god and and so they took the sheep out in a field and they just watched them where they went the sheep scattered wherever the sheep went they they caught them there and they slaughtered them there and and then they built an altar to the unknown god because that's all they knew to do and they would hope that that act would appease whatever god that they'd never heard of whatever miscellaneous unspecific god and the romans did that as well and i've got a picture of that idol that they found or it was actually an altar that's an altar to the roman unknown god just in case they didn't want to offend any gods and paul in acts chapter 17 and verse 16 encounters this in athens he encounters idolatry there and he said it said his spirit was stirred up in him and i can imagine paul was was quite a a man when he was preaching that you could tell when he was stirred up and and brother branham makes the statement that paul would be would be arrested today if he come and saw how the church operated the modern church and he said he would be arrested because of a people who who acted the way they did and and he would preach against that but he said now when he saw his spirit was stirred up in him when he saw the city wholly given to idolatry therefore disputed he in the synagogue with the jews with the devout persons and in the market daily with them that met him and so he was stirred up about it and and then he said then certain philosophers of the epicureans and the stoics encountered him and some said what will this babbler say because he was preaching you know he was he was stirred up maybe he was spitting a little bit and and he was stirred up about it and they said what will this babbler say other some he seemeth to be a setter forth of strange gods well they sure had some strange gods but you know they'd gotten so far away from god that they didn't recognize what the true god was when they saw it that they thought one having one god was strange worshiping one god was strange worshipping of god was perfect and just and mighty that that was strange and they worshipped these gods who were just like them we're living in that world of perversion today where if you worship the one true god you're seen as strange and so people are embarrassed to live like a christian but we ought to be embarrassed to live like the world lives right because they're it's strange gods that they're following after but here he said he seemeth to be a center forth of strange gods because he preached unto them jesus and the resurrection and they took him and brought him into erophagus saying may we know what this new doctrine whereof thou speakest is i'll bring in certain strange things to our ears we would know therefore what these things mean for all the athenians and strangers which were there spent their time in nothing else but either to tell or to hear some new thing there must be one of those around here somewhere and then paul stood in the midst of mars hill and he preached a sermon he said you men of athens i perceive it in all things you're too superstitious you got too many gods you you've let your imagination run away with you he said as i passed by and beheld your devotions i found an altar with this inscription to the unknown god he said whom therefore you ignorantly worship him declare i unto you amen he said you've been so superstitious you just covered all your bases that there's an unknown god let me tell you about that unknown god amen let me tell you about a god you don't know anything about or if we could just if a world could hear that today the world that we live in let me tell you about a god that's different than what the way you live he may be an unknown god it may seem strange to the world but it's the god of the bible amen amen and so the unknown god was ignorantly worshiped he said i'm going to tell you about him he said god that made the world and all things therein seeing that he is lord of heaven and earth well if not in temples made with hands neither is worshipped with men's hands now what's he saying he's not saying don't raise your hands he seems not worshipped with things made with men's hands he doesn't indwell something made with hands and you can go and listen to the sermon brother brandon preach christianity versus idolatry and he talks about how the idol and maybe we'll talk a little bit more about it later but the idol would would be there and he said one of the roman emperors got so enthused by it that he prostrated himself before the idol and he felt like the idol spoke back to it because he felt like his god had come and inhabited that that image but paul says god doesn't do that he doesn't inhabit images he doesn't inhabit pews he doesn't inhabit pianos or you hear me today brother remember said if an image spoke back then it was a devil that spoke but god don't inhabit images he inhabits people amen and brother madam called that being a living idol for god god comes down and indwells his people but now he dwelleth not in temples made with hands he's not worshiped with men's hands so he needed anything seeing he giveth to all life and breath and all things you remember even in the old testament he didn't dwell in the cherubim he dwelt among the cherubims you could have the literal ark of the covenant if the chicana wasn't fair it didn't do you any good he never veiled himself behind that what did he vail himself behind badger skins to show that he would veil himself behind human skin he always built himself behind a man now and he says he's not worshipped as though he needs anything he is made of one blood all nations of men why every one of us come from the ark all of us did we we can't claim one any better than the other all of us come from one of noah's three sons we're one blood all nations of men for to dwell in all the face of the earth and you know at that time all those people worshipped the one true god so at some point all nations have been exposed to the one true god and that's why paul can bring his indictment in romans chapter one and says they're all guilty because they should have known just by the evidence around them that god was scared but they fell from the true uh religion of god and preaching of one god and they've fallen into idolatry and we see the same thing in the church today now in the church nominal how that has fallen into idolatry now he has made a one blood all nations of men for to dwell in all the faces of the earth and has determined the times before appointed and the bounds of their habitation that they should seek the lord if happily they might feel after him and find him though he be not far from every one of us i like that they might feel after him like people that are blind he didn't not see him but they could feel after him he said but he's not far amen we're in him he says we live and move and have our being when paul says that he quotes one of their poets that that is actually the the wording of a greek poet he said as certain also of your own poets have said for we are also his offspring or as much then as we are the offspring of god we ought not to think that the godhead is like into gold or silver silver or stone this engraven by art and man's device or imagination and the times of this ignorance god winked at now commandeth all men everywhere to repent we don't worship him in imagination we worship him by revelation he reveals himself he doesn't let us just just grope around and find him in the dark anymore but he reveals himself what he is aren't you glad he's revealed himself to you and now commandeth all men everywhere to repent because he has appointed a day in which he will judge the world in righteousness by that man whom he hath ordained whereof he hath given assurance unto all men and that he raised him from the dead paul is standing there among all of the gods of of the greeks and the statues all around him and he says these are all gods of imagination god doesn't live in idols like this he doesn't dwell in stones and and wood and marble but he's a god that lives in a man amen the man christ jesus and he wants to live in you and i the true god is a god of revelation not a god of imagination in exodus 3 moses come to god and he said behold when i come to the children of israel shall say unto them the god of your fathers has sent me unto you and they shall say to me what is his name what shall i say unto them god said unto moses i am that i am i'm not what you imagined me to be i'm not what your preconceived notions of me are i'm not that's just the stories that you've heard but i am what i am i am that i am i am the present tense god who works in ways that only i can work and manifest myself god said i'm not going to leave it up to them to interpret who i am but when god come down and put his name jesus said i don't come in my own name i come in the father's name he put his name on that body of flesh it was god not not the pharisees figuring out who god was right not the not the jews not the greeks not the babylonians figuring out who god was but it was god himself who come down and says here's who i am right god come down in a supernatural way and that's the way he wants to reveal himself to us today he doesn't want us just to build a god of imagination where we assume that we know who he is and we assume that we know what he does but he wants to reveal himself for the bill to us individually until we can know aren't you glad we have a god we can know today he wants to reveal himself to each one of us individually until we can know this is my god amen this is the great i am this is and he tells him he said i'm the god of moses and i'm the rather the god of abraham isaac and jacob why because each one of them met god for himself hallelujah i am that i am i'm not going to let you define who i am but i am that i am and he says thus shalt thou say unto the children of israel i am has sent me unto you jesus identified himself the same way in john chapter 8 verse 58 jesus said to them verily verily i say unto you before abraham was he didn't say i was he said i am amen before abraham was i am we used to sing a song and say oh who do you say i am whence do you say i came do you know the father and can you tell his name jesus and jesus is the fullness of the godhead don't you see amen he's the great i am if you believe that today i am i am because god was wanting was revealing himself he doesn't just leave that up to the theories of man and that's why it's so important that we stay with what god revealed what god said because when we build our own imaginations build up idols in our own imagination we end up worshiping something other than god and that something cannot cannot intervene for us because it's not real now luke chapter 10 verse 21 look how god reveals himself you don't have to be the smartest man in the room and i'm glad for that you don't have to have the most money you don't have to have the best have had the best life in the past jesus come to many who had horrible lives you you may have been through a lot of things in your life but he said he didn't say he revealed himself to people like that but he said in that hour jesus rejoiced his spirit and said i thank the o father lord of heaven and earth that thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent and hast revealed them unto babes amen even so father for it seemed good in thy sight all things are delivered to me and my father no man knoweth who the son is but the father and who the father is but the son and he to whom the son will reveal him nobody knows who he is unless he's revealed himself to you personally then he's just a god of imagination right and that's why jesus said you must be born again it's not optional you've got to be born again and that has to be the foundational doctrine of the church you must be born again because if it's not we just worship him by imagination whether we worship by a message system or a church of god or or methodist or something else it's just an imagination unless we've met him now and then jesus rejoicing in spirit i don't know what that looked like but he he was happy with something about it he was rejoicing because this is the way god had done it and he turned to his disciples and he said privately blessed are the eyes would see the things that you see i tell you that many prophets and kings have desired to see those things which you see and have not seen them and hear those things which you hear and have not heard them not because they studied the most right and i believe in study but that's not why god revealed himself he didn't reveal himself because they they had been the ones who'd been taught the best but he revealed himself to those who were babies who would learn who he knew would listen a church sometimes we just need to come to church and be babies man tell me one time an older minister in the gospel and he told me he said i don't come to your church to receive anything i just come to fellowship because i already know the message i said that's not the way to come to the house of god i don't care how old you are how long have you been how long you've been around we should come to the house of god like a baby in that way and say lord lord i want to learn today i want to learn i want to see how you will reveal yourself to me how are you when you reveal yourself to me as a healer will you reveal yourself to me as a savior when you reveal yourself to me in my trial will you unveil yourself to me in your word lord how will you reveal yourself to me today amen blessed are your eyes you see god in a way that the theologian doesn't see him you see god in a way that even a great preacher somewhere doesn't seem but you see him because he's revealed himself to you you were a baby who could learn you were elected of god and there's something inside of you you want to hear from god amen you want to understand the things of god blessed are your eyes see we know him by revelation in revelation 3 7 he speaks to the angel of the church in philadelphia he said these things saith he that is holy he that is true he that hath the key of david he that openeth and no man sheddeth and sheddeth and no man openeth brother branham says that's the open door he said i've set the open door i have the keys i'm the only one that can open it i'm the only one that can reveal it i have the keys he said is that right there's no man can come to me except my father draws him all the father has given me will come to me no man can be saved only through jesus christ we still believe that today not through any church any organization any bishop pope just through jesus christ he has the key he's the only one he said that the keys of what david the future coming millennium where he'll sit on the throne of david i have the keys of david i'll open this door and nobody can shut it nobody can open it but me and nobody can shut it to me i love that i you know you can't keep me out of god's kingdom right you can't keep me out of the millennium why he said i have the keys you can apply that you can tell me that today i can't keep you out amen i can't do it no one else can do it only christ himself has the key amen he said how can it be how can any man know he is the christ until he's revealed himself to him see he reveals himself he has the key he can open the door or leave it alone right he can do that it it's up to him to do that you can't even do that for your children you understand he has the key he can open it he can leave it alone god has that key see he said i have the key to the door i am the door i am the way i am the truth i am the light he has the key he's the only one he said i'm the alpha and the omega i am the first and the last i am the father i'm the son i am the holy ghost i am he said not i was or will be see god if i was for god if i will be it's an idol of imagination but he said i am that i am hallelujah he said that said the whole thing i am not what i was or will be i am he said that means living presence for eternity amen see i am always lost always will be i am now as i always was and always will be see he said he's just i am but she said brother ben you don't understand what's happened you don't understand what's going on he's still the great i am you don't understand how old i am he's still the great i am you don't understand my condition he's still the great i am there's a desire in your heart to do something and maybe there's a desire in your heart and you say i want to serve god in this way i want to live for god in this way but you don't see a way for it to happen just step out in faith he's the great i am he's not a god of yesterday he's not a god of tomorrow's god of today tomorrow he'll be god then too yesterday he was god then too but he's god today amen he said i am always was always will be and i am now as i always was and always will be amen oh don't you love him today amen doesn't it make your god real to you i am i'm not an idol of imagination i am the god who can heal you today i am the god who can save you today i am the god who can change you from what you heard away you i want you to be i am the god that can take the situation that's messed up and make it right i am the god that can completely supernaturally change everything about you i am hallelujah amen i'm glad you didn't leave it up to us pastors he didn't leave it up to any other man but he said i am amen and if he is that i am then the bible the word of god reveals to us who he is amen and we know that all the secrets of who god is how did he choose to reveal that in his word right in the word they're all in the bible now at the end time those secrets have been revealed amen a revelation an unveiling not a creation of something new an idol of imagination but an unveiling of what is already there the word revelation is to pull off the pull the uh the covering off of the sculpture to pull it off and show the world what it is amen and this day we have a revelation at the end time we don't have to use imaginations we don't have to use imaginations because the message of the hour come to tell us he still is the i am we don't have to use imaginations about what he is or who he is he says i am the i am and then he reveals himself in his word when he reveals himself in his word then at the end time he said seal up there's certain things that were to be sealed up to the end time but now the mysteries have been revealed right we don't have to use imaginations because the bible says in the days of the voice of the seventh angel the mystery would be finished now he said well we don't know some things now look he was revealing himself he's revealing himself and at the end time we know the things that are needed at the end time which is the whole body of christ the whole book right the whole book is open now there is something that's not written in the book and brother random calls that how and why he would come or how and when he would come that's what brother brown talks about you can go and compare the seventh seal and christ is the mystery of god revealed i don't have time to get into that this morning but everything except that has been revealed and it just makes it so plain because if you take that seven still message and i challenge you to do that if you have time go and listen to the seventh seal and then listen to christ is the mystery of god revealed now that'll take you about a week but if you listen to one sermon and then the other right after it you'll find out that brother branham answers those questions in crisis the mystery of god revealed that threefold purpose that god had he talked about there was a threefold purpose to the sixth seal threefold purpose to the seventh steel and then brother brown talks about that in christ is the mystery of god revealed and preaches in some ways his seventh seal sermon but there's one thing we still didn't know we knew we were at the end time and that's the third poll we don't know what hour he's coming in right and that's what's silent what's still hidden but everything else has been revealed he's now in plain view you don't have to wait for him to be in plain view he is now the message of the hour shining the light on the scripture that has always been there but god in a supernatural manifestation see god come to moses in a supernatural manifestation a pillar of fire and says i am that i am and god come in this age in a supernatural manifestation a pillar of fire and says i am what i have hallelujah he chooses to reveal himself not as an unknown god but that's the great i am amen and jesus chose to reveal himself in christ and now he reveals himself in his word now i say in isaiah chapter 44. just go there with me for a moment this morning and i hope it don't bore you but isaiah chapter 44 and verse 9 we'll read several verses it gives us the process by which idols were made isaiah 44 9 and it speaks to us of what a folly that it is to have an idol now he says they that make a graven image are all of them vanity the delectable things shall not profit they are their own witnesses in other words they themselves the idol itself should tell you they don't see they don't know that they may be ashamed just a block of wood right that's all it is it's an idol but it had to come from somewhere where does the block of wood come from who has formed a god or molten a graven image that is profitable for nothing behold all his fellows shall be ashamed and the workmen they are of men he said let them all be gathered together let them stand up yet they shall fear and they shall be ashamed together and and isaiah's just pointing out the very thing here you got a god that you're bowing in front of and and here's the guys that made it they made him down at the god shop right you realize you could go into a denominational world today and kind of do the same thing you're bowing before creeds that were created you could point back to nicaea this is when they were made up you're going down you're bowing in front of things and you can do that even with the things of the world that we have today and people bow down to the ultra secularism they bow down to this idea of worldliness that it's got to be this way a woman has to do these certain things and a man has to do these things and you can show them where that come in it was invented huh it's not it's not something you have to fear you say well i'll be different if i dress right i'll be different from everybody else listen you'll be sane in your right mind just because everybody else does it because listen the majority of this world has always been idolaters you go back in history the most of the people have always been idolaters it doesn't make you strange to be a christian it makes you sane because these are all just idols of imagination he said these are the guys that made the idol the smith with the tongs both worketh in the coals and fashion it with hammers and worketh it with the strength of his arm he made it now examine what you believe if you made it i told somebody one time you couldn't believe that if you hadn't invented it you'd sure never get it out of the message it's if you've got a doctrine that you believe if you've got something you hold to examine it who made it was it a man was it god he said how will i know is it in the word right if it doesn't come from the word god didn't make it right now he he did it with the strength of his arms he said yeah he is hungry and his strength faileth he drinketh no water and his faint trying to get this idol made puts great effort into it the carpenter stretches out his rule he marks it with a line he fits it with planes markets it out with a compass makes it after the figure of a man according to the beauty of a man that it may remain in the house so he does kind of like what the mark does and builds things like this pulpit but see we'd never think to worship it we shouldn't worship the pulpit if we do there's a problem or the man in the pulpit right but but the pulpit you know mark made that and and he made it nice and it's beautiful but he wasn't making it for a god i meant it to be used by a man but here they were making something like this that would be nice and then bowing down in front of us and you're my god just come out of imagination he healeth him down cedars take it to cyprus and the oak which he strengtheneth for himself among the trees of the forest notice how manmade it is he even planted the tree that he got the wood from right so he he did it all he plants a certain kind of tree the rain nourishes it he said then shall it be for a man to burn so he takes part of the tree and burns it he'll take care of and warm himself he kindleth it and break his bread he maketh a god and worshipeth it so he takes and isaiah is illustrating the absurdity of it that with that same imagination that he used to create an idol he takes some of it and burns it huh he takes some of it and bakes bread with it you know we hold up our imaginations what we think way too much see that same mind that created that doctrine that same mind that created that feeling that nobody loves you nobody cares about you that complex that you have the same mind that created that also created a lot of things that you probably don't even want to tell nobody huh and that's true of all of us that's what create your dreams even at night and some of the things you you think about you wouldn't want none of us would want all of our thoughts put on these screens that same mind you do you used to do that then you create an imaginary god or an imaginary version of the word that teaches itself and and and props itself up by quotes and scriptures and other things but it's all made up god help us to stay with the word today listen he says he burneth part of it in the fire heart are there to eat his flesh he roasted roast he says and is satisfied yeah he warmeth himself and saith aha i am warm i have seen the fire. and the residue thereof he maketh the god even his graven image he falleth down unto it and worshipeth it and prayeth unto it and saith deliver me for thou art my god and he can't deliver him i was watching about the egyptian gods the other day and they made a god who was a woman who was a god of war they were so scared of this god that the the theory the theology of this god that they had was that they would keep her drunk all the time so they constantly had festivals where they would keep her drunk and they would uh constantly keep her drunk because they didn't want her to wake up and get mad right so when it come time for a war and and people were coming and the enemy was coming then they quit giving her wine and they thought she'd wake up and get mad and just destroy everything around her and and that would be uh that would be who she was why it was such an imagination because that's what that's the way they were so they thought god was like that too this particular god look deliver me they say the gods don't deliver them because they're not gods at all paul tells us that they're not gods at all but branham says that and christianity versus idolatry said they're nothing right but he said if you prostrate yourself before it a devil will speak to you right and that's where you have to be careful because you're idle the image that you've made is nothing but if you're not careful you'll give it such devotion that the devil will get in and speak to you listen he said they have not known nor understood they can't hear your cries for deliverance for he has shut their eyes that they cannot see in their hearts that they cannot understand none considereth it in his heart neither is their knowledge nor understanding to say look i burn part of it in the fire i bake bread upon the coaster of i've roasted flesh and eaten it shall i make the residue thereof an abomination shall i fall down to the stalk of a tree verse 20 he feedeth on ashes a deceived heart turned him aside what did it a deceived heart he made it out of his own imagination and he cannot deliver his soul nor sayest there not a lie in my right hand he can't ever acknowledge it because he's gone too far down the path of worship of the idol god help us today because almost anything can become an idol and that's where we have to be because i'm not preaching to another church i'm preaching to us i preach every one of my sermons to me you say brother ben who are you preaching at i'm preaching at me and then i'm preaching at you that are sitting here sure i'm preaching to you i'm preaching at me that's the only people i can preach that's all i'm responsible for right if somebody else hears it that's up to them but i'm preaching to us so whatever idol whatever imagination whatever idol that would create here's a lie in his right hand but he can't get rid of it because it would he's too embarrassed to say i was completely wrong see the man takes something that god made i want you to watch this and refashions it according to his own imagination and then enslaves himself to what he made right some of them would make a god make it idol excuse me my allergies are acting up today but he would take an idol and build it and set it up in a temple he built the idol he built the temple he invented the god right put it in the temple and then come under such a persuasion of this god that he would sacrifice his own children to it people still do that today they create a doctrine or an idea that they know they created they know they did but they can't acknowledge there's a lie in my right hand so they sacrificed their own children to a god that they created an idea that is different from the word god help us today look what the children of israel did in exodus 32 when the people saw that moses delayed to come down out of the mount the people gathered themselves together unto aaron and said unto him up make us gods what a strange request they got tired of waiting when did abraham get in trouble he got tired of waiting and his wife convinced him to go in and created an ishmael that's what happens now all the time people get tired of waiting on the rapture they get tired of waiting on something real and so they create a wild man a doctrine out of it and when the people saw moses was delayed the people gathered themselves to aaron and said up make us gods which will go before us for as for this moses the man that brought us up out of the land of egypt we want not what has become of him we don't know what become of him and aaron said unto them break off the golden earrings which are in the ears of your wives of your sons and of your daughters bring them unto me and it's thought that aaron is kind of aaron's role in all this is strange because he doesn't get judged with them he obviously doesn't believe like them but he goes along with them but he he tells them break off all the golden earrings and most scholars will tell you that that's because he thought they wouldn't do it but they wanted a god and they were willing to give up something to get it so they break off the golden earrings which are in their ears and brought them to aaron these were the spoils of egypt the material things they were blessed with as a result listen they only had remember these are the things they come out of egypt with they only they wouldn't have had these things as slaves but they had them because of as a result of the supernatural message that they followed and they used those things which they had as a result of a supernatural message and created an idol with it and verse 4 says he received them at their hand and fashioned it with a graving tool after he had made it to molten calf and they said these be thy god so israel which brought thee up out of the land of egypt aaron later when he's making his excuse to moses he says he says well i cast it into the fire and a calf came out it just happened to come out exactly like the one they saw in egypt isn't it funny that people's pet doctrines resemble the ones that they had in denominationalism and you take revelations of convenience where somebody's going through something and i hate it somebody goes through a problem maybe in their marriage or in some other way and it becomes a revelation of convenience all of a sudden they're enlightened as to what what the word says about this certain subject you look at it and it says it's kind of strange that it resembles what's going on in your life why because it's just an imaginary thing it doesn't stay with the word verse 5 when aaron saw it he built an altar before it and aaron made a proclamation notice what he says tomorrow is the feast to the lord tomorrow we're gonna have church like we always do this is a feast to the lord that word lord is it's jehovah that that's that's the god of israel tomorrow is the feast of the lord and tomorrow we're gonna bring our golden calf and worship the lord with it that's what he said he rose up early on tomorrow and offered burnt offerings and brought peace offerings those are religious acts that'd be like saying you come in you paid your tithes and you did your offering paid your offering you sang in the song service that's what they were doing they offered their burnt offerings they brought peace offerings that morning in the camp everything looked just like it always looked right everything looked just like it always looked and everything just seemed like it was always just the same as it always was and the people sat down to eat and to drink and rose up to play they were enjoying it after all moses wasn't there to watch them wasn't there to tell them no isn't it funny idolatry always ends up with worldliness and the reason for that is because idolatry assimilates with whatever the culture is right you find this in history the children of israel never denied jehovah they just added idols with him right they never did away with the worship of jehovah and israel never outlawed it what did they do they added bail to it they added a golden calf to it they even at one time added the brass serpent to it they built idols and and added those in because that was the culture that they lived in the world did it all the big tribes did it all the big kingdoms of the world did it can you imagine what being israel was like in that day israel was a small little group they were just a tribe and and to them they looked around on every corner were the smiths you know and they painted their steps red they were idolaters the assyrians were idolaters the babylonians were idolaters the ethiopians were all around on the egyptians that great culture that was there in that day all around them was idolatry and so they looked around and said well everybody else is doing it and idolatry when people's heart gets away from god idolatry leads them to assimilate with the world and the people sit down to eat and drink and they rose up to play just like they do it did with their idolatry just like the people who worshipped idols did they brought egyptian methods of worship into the worship of jehovah but jehovah doesn't let us choose how to worship him he chooses the place he chooses the time he chooses the person he does he chose you didn't he and he chooses the method you see the catholics never denied jesus christ being god they just added other gods the babylonians did the same thing look daniel 2 46 it feels late but it's not we changed to the 10 30 service and so it's noon not feeling nervous but i really haven't been preaching that long daniel 2 46 we're doing good that's what i'm saying you're going to get some of that potluck i always hate it when i have to preach sunday night i tried to get alan and stewart to preach because i wanted to eat this afternoon but we'll eat a little bit anyway daniel 2 46 the king nebuchadnezzar fell upon his face and worshiped daniel now why would he do that because daniel just showed him what his dream meant right daniel did something none of his philosophers could do he commanded that they should offer an oblation and sweet odors unto him and the king answered unto daniel and said of a truth it is that your god is a god of gods and a lord of kings and a revealer of secrets seeing thou could reveal this secret he recognized the gift in daniel's life verse 48 then the king made daniel a great man gave him many great gifts ruler over the whole province of babylon chief of the governors over all the wise men of babylon and daniel requested of the king and he said shadrach meshach and abednego over the affairs in the province of babylon but daniel sat in the gate of the king listen i want you to hear this just because a political leader likes christianity or would even like the message don't mean that that's what they are and i'd rather have one that liked it than one that didn't it's a whole lot easier to to have one that likes it than one that don't but be wary of that too because any time a political leader ever identified closely with christianity they tried to co-opt it and turn it into something that's pagan right and this happens it corresponds in the history to constantine in in the uh in new testament times and in the time of the nigerian council in that roman system as that old rome was dying and he reinvigorated it with the christian principles and then added paganism to it but look at the next verse now daniel 2 49 the next verse is daniel 3 1. nebuchadnezzar the king made an image of gold whose height was three score cubits and the breadth throws six cubits and he set it up in the plain of dura in the province of babylon look what he does brother brown says it this way he said i want you to notice as soon as the king saw this vision and he made it he forced every person in his kingdom in his domain to worship this image as soon as he saw it he forced every person in his kingdom to worship this image this is something by the way you can find all through the message brother branham identifies the same thing it's not just in one spot he said it's believed by scholars he said in which i do believe that a spirit-filled person would see it that he worshipped daniel is what he did he said he made an image to daniel and he called it belt to shazzar he called daniel about the shazar which is the name of his god he made an image and forced every person to worship that image he forced every person notices another another uh characteristic of idolatry is that it's a forced religion a forced religion god don't do that but now he forced everyone to in his kingdom to worship this image he made an image now he said i want you to notice that the beginning of the gentiles when god dealt with them they got haughty in their heart oh my and forced every man to worship the image of a holy man the gentile age was issued in with that he says it will go out in the same way the same way a boycott of the mark of the beast that will force people to worship images and to do things the things that we've been taught that was contrary to the word of god now notice deforest now brother branham talks about force you can go find it and i didn't i cut so much stuff out of this message today because i don't want to tire you out but brother madame i had the quote where brother random says that national force forced israel into their homeland right that's national force it was national force it will be national force and we'll put the church in the world council of churches national force will do that but national force will not put the people in the bride that's what brother branham taught so if you're waiting on something to happen on a national level that will force us to cooperate that will force us to be in the bride and to be real christians not going to happen because the truth is if you're forced you're going to do what's in your heart anyway people do as i said what they want to do right so it'll be national force that'll force or it was national force to force the jews it'll be national force it forced forces at the end time the foolish version of those into the image of the beast enforces the modern church but it's amen it's the power of god he says that puts the bride puts the people in the bride the power of god amen so we're not looking for a national power to come like nebuchadnezzar and be raise up some image to a holy man we're not looking for everybody to recognize the message is true that's not what we're looking for what are we looking for we're looking for the power of god to put every member in the bride and i believe that's what he's doing today he said brother it'll be so slick and sly until it would deceive the very elect if possible i'm talking about this worship of a holy man he said so you better purpose in your heart tonight and be filled with god's holy spirit that you'll be able to discern the right and wrong thing when the proclamation is issued why now what was the idol the idol was nebuchadnezzar nebuchadnezzar's imagination excuse me added to a true prophet's revelation right the prophet gave him the dream and nebuchadnezzar imagined and made an image to daniel now brother brown said they was to bow before this image and to do worship to the image you notice he said in those times daniel was silent he said amen oh and he said i hope you get this daniel was silent letting them he said they had to make their own choice we have to make our choice today what will you worship will you worship an image someone created out of the message will you worship an image that you create or will you worship god the god of the bible revealed by this message the image on the pedestal might be a holy man you say could it be a prophet absolutely because it was daniel but i believe we've been taught that we've been taught better than that we know not to worship a prophet but what if the pastor's on the pedestal what if it's our own image where we put ourselves first now we're bringing it down aren't we put ourselves first in everything we do our thoughts matter more than god's word does god help us today god help me today i don't want to do that i don't want to worship an image i want to worship the god of the bible but there were three hebrew children in that day shadrach meshach and abednego and in verse 16 it says that shadrach meshach and abednego answered and said to the king oh nebuchadnezzar we're not careful to answer thee in this matter when the time comes that we have to make a decision on what to do i'm going to follow the word don't you realize your whole life is just a series of decisions that you make i'm gonna follow the word brother danny years ago you made a decision to follow the word that's why you've remained huh if you've been in the church for a long time if you've been in the message for a long time and you stayed steady at some point you had to make a decision to follow the word and at every junction whenever whenever some somebody failed or somebody let down you weren't following that man you followed the word huh are you hearing so you didn't destroy you yes it hurt but you're following the word you had to make a decision your life is a series of decisions that you make are you going to follow the word are you going to be like shadrach meshach and abednego who said we won't be careful to answer you in this matter we're not going to be careful we're not going to we're not going to spare your feelings in this we will not worship an idol if it be so our god whom we serve is able to deliver us do you believe that today he's able to deliver us from all the persecution he's able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace and he will deliver us out of thine hand o king but if not be it known unto thee o king we will not serve thy gods hallelujah it's got to be a life or death issue it's got to be something you're willing to life or death it doesn't matter i'm going to serve god i'm sorry i feel like i'm screaming at you this morning i'm going to serve god it's hard i know it's hard it's hard on some of us some of you have been through some things some of you dealt with message people to the point where you wondered if the message was true but see not everybody that quotes the message is in the message or has the message in them some of you have dealt with family situations that are horrible i i've dealt with situations like that i know what it's like to question everything but there's got to come a moment when you say even though it's hard even though the fire's hot i'm going to serve god if nobody else does god forbid my wife wouldn't my my husband would my my family wouldn't my my church wouldn't i'm still going to i'm going to follow the word i'm going to put it first i'm going to put the god in first place in my life if that means getting up in the morning and reading and studying and praying whatever it is lord help me to put you first being known unto thee oh can we say that to the god of this evil age be it known unto the old king though you're very religious so you might it might have a trapping of religious but be it known unto the old king we will not serve thy gods nor worship the golden image which that was set up what happened god was watching brother branham goes into a drama about how god was watching over his children that day and gabriel saw it and he come up to jehovah and he says he says oh he said let me go down i can fight i'm a warrior let me go down and fight for him he said no wormwood come up to him and said i'm i control the oceans and the rivers let me go down and fight for him he said no he said this i've got to do myself amen amen god's still watching today he said i've watched them all night i heard their prayer meeting i've seen their stand for the word hallelujah i wonder if if you can tell that he's watching today i wonder if you know that he's watching you today that he knows what's going on he said i watched him all night i heard their prayer meeting he wouldn't hear much much many places anymore would he but he said i heard their prayer meeting why they got desperate amen i heard their prayer meeting i seen their stand for my word i'll be there on time the devil tries to tell you what you won't be able to get a job you won't be able to do anything if you live that way if you live that way so and so will leave you so when someone won't fellowship with you anymore you lose you lose your wife lose your husband but you say god i'm gonna stand for you regardless because he hears you amen he said i can see him raise up in his kingly garments fall around him like that and say amen come here east wind north southwest step over on that thunderhead yonder i'm going to ride you as a chariot this morning i'm going down into babylon i'm going to change the scene he said oh brother he was right there on time do you believe he's on time today not an idol of imagination they refuse to worship that but a real living god he was right there on time listen he said his eye is on the sparrow and i know he watches me he's still watching tonight watching me he's watching you he's watched whether we'll stand or not stand what decisions we will make whether we'll stand true to the word or get away from it don't tell me you've never struggled with that i've had people talk to me tell me there was a time when i struggled and i looked even my own self i wondered if this message was true but then something on the inside grabbed hold of god oh you'll struggle satan is after you he's attacking you [Music] he's watching you he he's trying to make you make a decision that's not right trying to take you away from the word that decision might be something about a job something about a marriage something about something else to try to take you away from the word but you're going to stay with the word you don't have to go to this church to stay with the word but you will stay with the word i'll say it this way you will go to church you have to stay with the word brother branham says he's watching what decisions we will make whether we'll stand true to the word or get away from it it's later than you think you say i've put forth this effort god's god he's watching i put forth this effort and i've come the house of god and i just don't feel the blessings anymore you just keep coming keep putting forth the effort because he's on his way amen when you get in the fire he'll be there as the fourth man in the fire he may not deliver you before the king he may not deliver you even at the moment you're being thrown in but right at the moment you need it at the darkest hour that's when he comes around he's watching you to see whether you'll stand true whether we'll stand true to the word or get away from it children he's still watching today amen this message did not come to give us another god to add to our imaginations but it came to declare that christ is the one and the only i am who's still alive today still the fourth man of the fire and if he is i am whatever you have need of he's here to meet that need you believe that let's power heads together musicians come this afternoon we'll deal with this and get a little more specific some of these idols that we create but i just want to just for a few minutes before we have communion but i want to just invite you to talk to him for a moment maybe the devil's been talking to you and trying to get you to quit and i'm not talking about just quitting this church i'm talking about quitting god the devil gets to talking to you like this it doesn't matter it doesn't matter all these years you've served god and then now look at you you talked to brother branham that way when his wife and his baby was saying they're dying but he's still the fourth man in the fire today he's still the great i am he's not the i was or the i will be he's i am and he's able to come into your situation today into the fire so you don't understand what i've been through but he'll come into the fire [Music] they come out they didn't smell like smoke not even a the latches of their shoes not even their shoestrings was burned you couldn't even tell that they'd been through it why because the fourth man was in the fire let him be that fourth man in the fire today let him come down and just deal with you he's a real god today he's not an idol of imagination if you built an idol of imagination cast that down today and embrace the real i am if he is i am then whatever you have need of you'll meet that need today heavenly father we believe god that you are the great i am you're here today lord to meet every need you are lord you entered into this age the fourth man in the fire in an age of laodicea in an age of satan's eden you came lord into the very midst of this age and presented yourself revealed yourself in in a way that you'd not done in any other age you revealed yourself completely to us lord
