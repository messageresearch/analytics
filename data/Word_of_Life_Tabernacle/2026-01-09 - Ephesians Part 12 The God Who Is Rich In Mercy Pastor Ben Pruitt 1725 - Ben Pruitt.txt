Aren't you thankful for the healer of the broken pieces? cuz I thought of uh actually I I asked him to sing that song. I thought of brother JT and I thought of the loss he went through. But I thought, you know, we have a healer of the broken pieces. Aren't you thankful we have a comforter? He said he would send us a comforter which was the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; We don't have to worry about nothing. &gt;&gt; You know, all fear is gone. We don't even have to think about what's going to come for tomorrow because we know who holds the future. I think about all the sickness going on. We, you know, you can get worried about it or you can just start resting in the promises of God. How many's ready to rest in the promises here tonight? I wonder if we could stand together. Can we sing that? I'm trusting and resting. Well, I'm trusting and resting in the promise of God. Yes, we are. I'm trusting and resting while on this earth I tr with the word of God down in my soul. Use my Jesus complete control. I'm trusting and resting in the promise of God. Each day I am walking, trusting in his place. I'll keep pressing onward. How about y'all tonight? Until I reach that lake. Well, my father knows just what I need. I look to him and I'll let him be. I'm trusting and resting in the promise of God. Sing it to him. Well, I'm trusting and trusting in the promise of God. I trust in mystery along this earth with the word of God down in my soul gives my Jesus complete control. I'm trusting and resting in the promise of God. I like this one. Well, I'm looking to Jesus to meet every need. I'm thanking him always that he hears my please. Well, my faith believes what cannot see. I'm seeking him daily at on my knees. I'm trusting and resting in the promise of God with all your hearts now. Oh, I'm trusting and resting in the promise of God. I'm trusting and resting. While on this earth I draw with the word of God down in my heart. Gives my Jesus. Oh yes it does. I'm trusting and resting in the promise of God. Let's sing it again as we invite our pastor now. I'm trusting and resting in the promise of God. I'm trusting and resting.

Give him a hand of praise. Aren't you glad you can rest in his promise tonight? Amen. Amen. Let's bow our head heads together for just a moment. If you've got a special need tonight, you'd like to make way by make known by uplifted hand. I know he knows your heart and knows your need. Brother Brandham talked about how that made him feel when people raise their hand with a need and said, "If it makes me feel that way, how do you think it makes him feel?" He cares about our needs. So thankful for that tonight. Heavenly Father, we're so thankful, Lord, to be in your house once again in the rush of the week and the busyiness, oh God, and the things that we go through and yet we're able to take the time apart on a Wednesday night, Lord, to worship you. So thankful for that opportunity. I pray you'd bless us tonight, each one, Lord, that raised their hand. I I don't know what the need is, but you know, I pray that you'd meet that need tonight. Oh, God. We know there's some serious needs among us. I pray you'd heal those sick people and Lord, touch their bodies, those that are mourning today. I pray you'd turn their mourning into dancing. Lord, take a Lord, a spirit of joy, a garment of praise for a spirit of heaviness. Pray for you granted today. Oh, we thank you for your love, Lord. Thank you for your goodness. You're always good to us. No matter what we've gone through, we know that you're I'll have all things in your hands. We thank you for that. Pray you bless this service tonight. We commit it to you. We ask it in Jesus' name. Amen. Amen. Thank the Lord. Amen. Ephesians chapter 2 and verse four. We'll just read that one verse. We'll be reading down through the uh second chapter of Ephesians down through the first few verses if you want to keep your Bible open to that tonight. Ephesians chapter 2 and verse 4 says, "But God," I love this, "who is rich in mercy." &gt;&gt; Rich. Aren't you glad he's not poor tonight? &gt;&gt; He's rich in mercy for his great love wherewith he loved us. The Lord would add his blessing to the word. You may be seated. I want to speak to you on that. the God who is rich in mercy. As we continue our study in the book of Ephesians, Paul begins this second chapter by reminding us of our previous condition. He says verse one, you hath he quickened or made alive who were dead in trespasses and sins. He said, you were dead. Uh we were all dead in trespasses and sins. And Paul, he says it just a little differently, but says the same thing in Colossians. In Colossians 1:21, he says, "You that were sometime alienated and enemies in your mind by wicked works, yet now hath he reconciled &gt;&gt; in the body of his flesh through death." Notice how he reconciled you, how he reconciled me was in the body of his flesh through death to present you holy and unblameable and unreprovable in his sight. I love that. Unreprovable in his sight. In other words, a a people that live without rebuke because of what he did for us on Calvary. &gt;&gt; But h how did we get in the state of rebellion? How did we get in a state of uh uh that were of death of trespasses and sins? We got in that state naturally in Psalms 51 and verse 5. He said, "Behold, I was shapen in iniquity and in sin did my mother conceive me." So, we come into the world speaking lies. We come into the world with a fallen nature. We were born dead. In Adam, all die. But aren't you glad tonight that in Christ all are made alive. And I'm glad to be made alive in Christ. We were each one born dead. Our our spirit, our nature, our spiritual nature was still born. We did not know who we were. But but by his grace now we do know who we are and and we know that we belong to God. &gt;&gt; What are the attributes of spiritual death in Ephesians chapter 2 again in verse two he said wherein in time past you walked according to the course of this world according to the prince of the power of the air the spirit that now workketh in the children of disobedience. That word disobedience is unbelief which opposes the gracious word and purpose of God. So we were children of unbelief. What does that make us now? Children of faith. &gt;&gt; Children of unbelief. Became children of faith. But he said in time past we walked according to the course of this world. In other words, you walked according to the age that you were living in. So if the other people did drugs, you did drugs. If if the spirit of the age was to lie and to steal and and to commit adultery, that's what you did. That's what I did. But but but now he said you are you become the children of God. And but you did walk according to the age that you were living in. 1 Corinthians 6:9, Paul describes the way the age is. He said, "Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God?" He said, "Be not deceived, neither fornicators, nor idolattors, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, that's those that are homosexual, nor abusers of themselves with mankind, nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners shall inherit the kingdom of God." He's saying, "Somebody like that that does that is not going to come into the kingdom of God." He says, "And such were some of you." Amen. &gt;&gt; I don't we may not want to admit what particular part of that we fulfilled, but such were some of you. But God rich in mercy. &gt;&gt; But you are washed. But you are sanctified. But you are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus and by the spirit of our God. He's saying this is what you were. This is not what YOU ARE. WE DON'T believe in a gospel that leaves you the way that you are. We believe in a POWERFUL GOSPEL, THE POWER OF GOD into salvation that changes you from what you were to what you are in Christ. DON'T CONTINUE TO WALK THE WAY you've walked. HE SAID, "IN TIME PAST, YOU WALKED THAT WAY, BUT NOW YOU WALK DIFFERENTLY BECAUSE mercy has gotten a hold of your life." &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Every one of us were bound for destruction. He says in verse three, Ephesians 2:3, he said, "Among whom also we all had our conversation, our lifestyle in times past in the lust of our flesh, fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind, and were by nature the children of wrath, even as others." You were by nature the children of wrath, even as others, you were bound for destruction. We were bound for destruction. But verse four, but God who is rich in mercy, &gt;&gt; hallelujah, he had enough in the bank account. He had enough MERCY TO REACH DOWN WHERE I WAS, BROTHER JT, ENOUGH MERCY TO REACH DOWN FOR BROTHER PAUL, to reach DOWN FOR BROTHER HARVEY, TO REACH DOWN FOR SISTER ANNA AND EACH ONE OF YOU HERE TONIGHT. HE HAD ENOUGH MERCY TO REACH DOWN FOR YOU. AND I WANT TO THANK HIM FOR THAT TONIGHT. I WANT TO THANK HIM for his mercy and his love in my life. &gt;&gt; His mercy was a result of his great love. He said, "God who is rich in mercy, for his great love wherewith he loved us for his great love, HIS ATTRIBUTE OF MERCY FULFILLS HIS attribute of love." You realize that God being GOD, HE HAS TO be everything that he is, &gt;&gt; right? God will never impersonate HIMSELF. HE WILL NEVER BE SOMETHING DIFFERENT than what he is. But if he IS LOVE, HE WILL ALWAYS be love. &gt;&gt; IF HE IS RIGHTEOUSNESS, HE WILL ALWAYS BE RIGHTEOUSNESS. Oh my, he's if he's just, he will always be just. And so to fulfill his his uh his attribute of righteousness and of justice, he had to die for our sins. Aren't you glad that he did? &gt;&gt; But it was his attribute of of love that produced his attribute of mercy. &gt;&gt; His attribute OF MERCY FULFILLS HIS attribute of love. Verse 5, even when we were dead in sins hath quickened us together with Christ by grace you are saved. We are quickened in his resurrection. Brother said it's the greatest thing that could happen to a person is to be quickened to be made alive from the dead. It's that word quicken is to reanimate conjoinly with to quicken together with. So in other words, we were made alive in his resurrection. &gt;&gt; That's how we were made alive. It's by his resurrection. That's right. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said, "You deserve to be that way." In other words, the children of wrath because you was a sinner, but God who is rich in mercy. &gt;&gt; That's the thing. And I'm just going to pull some thoughts tonight from that that sermon, but God who's rich in mercy. Some of you heard it before the service. So, some of the things will be familiar to you tonight. But I believe it was a masterpiece. I believe God had a prophet preach it for a reason. &gt;&gt; He said, "You deserve to be that way because you was a sinner. But God who is rich in mercy. That's the thing. God who was rich. All these things that we were but God that made the change right there. God who was rich in mercy. He said, "Oh, I'm so glad for that. That he being rich in mercy. If he was just rich in money, if he was just rich in materials, which he is, BUT YET THE GREATEST thing is being rich in mercy. &gt;&gt; Oh my. Listen, you don't have to worry about God being too poor to be able to help you." Come on. &gt;&gt; Right. You know, if you were coming to a rich man, if you were coming to me and asking me for $10,000, you wouldn't have much confidence you would get it. &gt;&gt; Come on. I know some of you say, "Well, Brother Ben, don't have that kind of money, you know." But but if we were asking a rich man, we would believe that a man who was rich had the ability TO GIVE IT TO US. &gt;&gt; Oh my. Listen to me. If we we would believe that Elon Musk would have the ability to give away money because what's $1,000 to Elon Musk? What's 10,000? What's a million? What's a billion dollars? Right? IF IF HE LOST 10 BILLION DOLLARS TODAY, IT WOULDN'T mean nothing to him. YOU REALIZE WHEN GOD SAVED YOU, HE HAD ENOUGH MERCY to save you FROM ALL OF YOUR SIN AND TO SAVE THE EVERY SEED OF GOD THAT HE EVER HAD IN HIS MIND BEFORE THE FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD. HE HAD ENOUGH MERCY. LISTEN, IT DON'T MATTER HOW DARK YOUR LIFE WAS, HOW FAR AWAY WE WERE, HE HAD ENOUGH MERCY TO SAVE YOU. BUT HE DIDN'T STOP THERE. HIS MERCY EXTENDED EVEN TO YOUR NATURAL BODY AND HIS HIS ATONEMENT TOOK CARE NOT ONLY OF SALVATION but also of healing. &gt;&gt; So his MERCY NOT ONLY SAVED YOU BUT HIS MERCY HEALED YOU. &gt;&gt; RIGHT? &gt;&gt; AREN'T YOU glad for his mercy mercy today? &gt;&gt; Mercy is compassion. But Brandon said if he was just rich in money, if he was just rich in materials, which he is, yet the greatest thing is being rich in mercy. He in Romans 9:15, he said to Moses, "I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy. I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion." &gt;&gt; So then, it is not of him that willth, nor of him that runth, but of God that showeth mercy. &gt;&gt; So if he had mercy on you to quicken you to the word, and brother Brandon brings that out, and the God who was rich in mercy, there must have been a seed there somewhere. &gt;&gt; So I think you can have confidence in that today. I know sometimes we wonder, well, am I a seed of God? I wonder if I really am. I wonder I wonder if I really uh if I if you know, maybe I just agreed with the message. Maybe I'm just impersonating a believer. Maybe I'm a an Esau. Maybe I'm a a Cain. But listen to me. If he showed you mercy, &gt;&gt; are you with me now? &gt;&gt; To quicken you to the word, IF YOU'VE BEEN QUICKENED TO THE WORD, MADE ALIVE TO THE WORD IN YOUR HEART, there had to be a seed there somewhere. Come on. &gt;&gt; Because a a a person, a Cain or an Esau, they might assimilate with the word, but they could never be quickened to it. &gt;&gt; But if you were quickened to it, no matter WHAT HOW HOW MANY STRUGGLES YOU MIGHT HAVE, NO MA NO MATTER HOW HARD YOUR LIFE WAS, NO MATTER how many difficulties you might have in life, IF YOU'VE BEEN QUICKENED TO THE WORD, you are a SEED OF GOD. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE NONSEED cannot be quickened. &gt;&gt; I hope you're hearing me tonight. That ought to cast out every devil of doubt, every demon that tries to tell you, "Well, I'm not a believer." I I remember early on in my life that that was messing with me a little bit in my mind because my father told me because he I disagreed with him on something and he told me he said, "You're you're not predestined." And and that that gave me a complex for a while. And I struggled with that when I would hear preaching about predestination. Maybe I'm not a maybe I'm not predestined. MAYBE I'M NOT a feat of God. BUT IT WAS HIM THAT QUICKENED ME. IF I WASN'T THE SEED OF GOD, I COULDN'T HAVE BEEN MADE ALIVE TO the word. &gt;&gt; ARE YOU HEARING ME TODAY? IN SPITE OF MY BETTER JUDGMENT, IN SPITE OF WHAT I WANTED TO DO WITH MY LIFE, I'M HERE TODAY BY THE GRACE OF GOD. PAUL SAYS, BY THE GRACE OF GOD, I AM WHAT I AM. &gt;&gt; SO, IF HE HADN'T QUICKENED ME, I HAD TO BE A SEAT OF GOD OR HE would have never quickened me. He could have never quickened me. There would be no life there. &gt;&gt; Brother Brand said, you couldn't have even been born in this world without the fornowledge of God. Right? &gt;&gt; He said, "And when that little baby is born into the world, THERE IS SOMETHING IN THAT BABY. IF HE'S EVER GOING TO HAVE LIFE, THERE'S A LITTLE SOMETHING IN THERE IN THAT CHILD THEN THAT HE COMES TO SOONER OR LATER. OH, FOR SOME IT WAS SOONER. FOR SOME IT WAS LATER, BUT SOONER OR LATER HE'LL COME TO IT." &gt;&gt; ALL RIGHT? &gt;&gt; A little seed is in him. Again, he said, "Now we're a part OF GOD. YOU ALWAYS WAS. YOU DON'T REMEMBER IT BECAUSE you were only an attribute in God. You were only in his thinking. Your very name, if it ever was on the book of life, it was put THERE BEFORE THE FOUNDATION of the world. He knew what you were. He said, "I'm only saying this NOT TO MIX UP DOCTRINE, BUT TO STRAIGHTEN IT OUT THAT WE MIGHT GET AWAY from this fear and scare." WAS IT DURING THE PENTECOSTAL AGE, during the holiness age, PEOPLE COULD PUT YOU IN, TAKE YOU TAKE YOU OUT OR PUT YOU IN DEPENDING ON how you agreed with the pastor, DEPENDING ON HOW much you agreed with the church OR DEPENDING ON HOW YOU LIVE FROM DAY TO DAY. BUT BROTHER BRANDHAM COMES AND HE SAID, "I WANT TO TAKE THIS FEAR AND SCARE AWAY FROM YOU." THE PASTOR didn't give it to you. The pastor can't TAKE IT AWAY. EVEN HOW YOU LIVE. YOU LIVE THE WAY THAT YOU LIVE BECAUSE YOU LOVE GOD. &gt;&gt; BUT IT'S NOT LIVING RIGHT THAT MAKES YOU A SEED OF GOD. JACOB WAS A SEED of God. HE SAID, "JACOB HAVE I LOVED." &gt;&gt; Even though he LIVED A MUCH WORSE LIFE THAN ESAU DID, but it was BUT WHEN HE WAS CHANGED, HE WALKED DIFFERENT. &gt;&gt; AND WHEN WE'RE CHANGED, we walk different. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. He said, "I want to get away from this fear and scare. You don't know who you are. You're not going to be. But now, someone say it with me tonight." Now, &gt;&gt; now you're the sons of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. See, you always were the sons of God. For when God had you in his thinking at the beginning, you have to be, listen to this now. We just want to nail this down. Some part of you, your life that's in you now, had to be with God before there. He said, well, when he before he even became material here on earth, before there was anything but God, you were one of his attributes. So just like love, he had to express love. He had to express mercy. He had to express justice. He had to express you. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? &gt;&gt; You were one of HIS ATTRIBUTES. HE KNEW what your name would be. He knew the color of hair you would have. &gt;&gt; See, God knew brother David White would have white hair. &gt;&gt; And he knew that his name would be white. Right? God knew that before the foundational view. Do we really believe that, church? Why do we worry SO MUCH THEN? WHY DO WE LET LITTLE THINGS GET IN between us and the Lord AND AND WE THINK, WELL, MAYBE I'M JUST NOT EVEN A CHRISTIAN. Maybe I shouldn't even serve God. HE KNEW YOU BEFORE THE FOUNDATION of time. &gt;&gt; HE KNOWED ALL ABOUT YOU. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham, in this sermon is where he says, he said, "Some of you can fellowship with me on this thought." HE SAID, "WHEN we were children and and even when we were growing up, he talked about how there was something in us WAS JUST MADE US DIFFERENT AND WE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT IT WAS. WE WERE STILL SINNERS, BUT THERE WAS ALREADY SOMETHING THERE. &gt;&gt; It just needed to be quickened. He said, "YOU HAD TO DIE TO YOURSELF TO BE QUICKENED TO the word." &gt;&gt; He said, "There was God somewhere, yet you were a sinner." He said, "You remember that? Certainly." NOW, WHAT WAS THAT? THERE WAS THAT little form of life in you then. He said, "You went from church to church trying to find the truth." He said, "BUT WHEN YOU HEAR HEARD THE WORD, you know, you know where you come from. You knew what was the truth. You were always the seed was in you always. The word seeing the word that was in you. This is powerful. &gt;&gt; The word seeing the word that was in you. &gt;&gt; Before you were saved. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; God's word said. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Come on. &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You were part of the word. &gt;&gt; Right. You were already written in the word. You were a spoken seed word. Word. Seed of God. Yes, sir. So then if the word was in you, the word seen the word that was in you that was before the foundation of the world saw the word and you come to it. &gt;&gt; So brother Brandon said it was like that duck. He talked about the eagle and he talked about the duck and some of you heard it on the tape. Brother Brandham said the duck. He said he got he got out there. He said he was just scratching with the chickens. He thought he was a chicken. He said, "BUT ONE DAY HE GOT FAR ENOUGH behind the barn, far enough away from those walls, you know, GOT FAR ENOUGH AWAY from those walls and they were training him to be a chicken and HE CAUGHT A SCENT OF WATER." &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. But JT, the winds must have just turned and blew the RIGHT DIRECTION. DO YOU REMEMBER WHAT THAT WAS LIKE? YOU MIGHT HAVE WENT TO A MESSAGE CHURCH. YOU MIGHT HAVE BEEN GROW UP IN A MESSAGE HOME, BUT YOU JUST THOUGHT YOU WERE LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE AND YOU SAID, "I CAN'T WAIT UNTIL I'M OLD ENOUGH TO LEAVE." BUT ONE DAY YOU GOT FAR ENOUGH OUT BEHIND THE BARN. MAYBE YOU GOT MAYBE AT CAMP. MAYBE ON A WEDNESDAY NIGHT. MAYBE ON A SUNDAY MORNING. MAYBE IT WAS IT WAS JUST ONE DAY AS YOU GOT OLDER YOU SUDDENLY REALIZED I'M NOT THE SON OF MY PARENTS. I'M A SON OR DAUGHTER OF GOD. &gt;&gt; WHAT WAS IT? YOU CAUGHT THE SIN OF WATER. THE WINDS JUST HAPPENED TO BLOW IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. AND WHEN THE HOLY GHOST WINDS BLEW, YOU SMELLED THAT. THERE WAS SOMETHING ABOUT YOU. AND THERE'S SOMETHING IN A DUCK, COME ON CHURCH, THAT'S GOT TO SWIM. THERE'S SOMETHING IN A BELIEVER THAT'S GOT TO LIVE RIGHT. &gt;&gt; SOMETHING IN A BELIEVER THAT'S GOT TO COME TO THE WORD. &gt;&gt; A duck is is what he is. He can't help that. &gt;&gt; And when it was quickened to him, &gt;&gt; he went quacking. I wish Trip would have brought his duck call out here. He come down the street today quacking. I thought it was a herd of ducks coming through coming through our area cuz Trip had his window down quacking as he come through down through town. We'll probably get complaints about that. But anyway, just said, "How was that herd of ducks?" Didn't you see that coming through? What was it? A duck's going to sound like a duck. He's going to be a duck because it's in him to be a duck. &gt;&gt; Oh, that's the way when we're born again, what's in us begins to come out. IT WASN'T EXPRESSED BEFORE BECAUSE we weren't quickened. BUT YOU HATH HE QUICKENED, &gt;&gt; MADE ALIVE. HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. Who were dead in trespasses and sins. &gt;&gt; The Brand said, "When you heard the word, you knew where you come from. The word seen the word that was in you." He said, "And that's the way it is with every born again believer. You can hear all the theology you want to, all the man-made discrepancy, but when that word flashes out there, there's something takes a hold. You come to it." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Look at Paul. If if you think you can save yourself, explain Paul, &gt;&gt; right? Paul didn't want God. He didn't want nothing to do with God. &gt;&gt; And he was literally knocked off his high horse &gt;&gt; on the way to the ro on the road to Emmas. &gt;&gt; HE WASN'T LOOKING FOR GOD. BUT WHEN HE WHEN HE WAS KNOCKED OFF OF HIS HORSE, HE HAD ENOUGH understanding of THE SCRIPTURES. HE SAW THAT LIGHT AND HE SAID, "LORD, LORD," HE SAID, "WHO ARE YOU?" YEAH. &gt;&gt; AND AND HE SAID he said, "I'm Jesus whom you persecute." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. And that was enough for Paul. &gt;&gt; HE SAID, "IT'S HARD FOR YOU TO KICK AGAINST the pricks." And he he come to himself and he was led into the city. He received the baptism of the Holy Ghost AND BECOME THE APOSTLE TO THE GENTILES. &gt;&gt; WHAT WAS IT? HAD PAUL HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH IT? HE SAID, "BY THE GRACE OF GOD, I am what I am." &gt;&gt; He said, "I WAS ZEALOUS ABOVE ALL MY FELLOWS." He was the number ONE PHARISEE. BUT HE COME TO GOD, GOT A HOLD OF HIM ANYWAY. &gt;&gt; RIGHT? &gt;&gt; Brother Bram said that's the same thing the believer is. There's something in him. WHEN HE MEETS GOD FACE TO FACE, HE COMES TO HIMSELF. &gt;&gt; THAT SEED IS IN him and it's quickened. LOOK AT THE EXAMPLE of the prodigal son. &gt;&gt; When did the prodigal son ever stop being a son &gt;&gt; now? &gt;&gt; Now think about it. &gt;&gt; HE LEFT THE father's house, &gt;&gt; but he was still a son. &gt;&gt; He took his inheritance early and squandered HIS LIVING ON EVERYTHING. THE WAY MANY of us did. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Right. Left and went out in the world and DID HIS THING, &gt;&gt; BUT HE WAS STILL A SON, &gt;&gt; HE STILL BELONGED IN THE FAMILY. HE DIDN'T ACT LIKE IT, BUT he was still a son. &gt;&gt; He didn't know it, BUT HE WAS STILL A SON. &gt;&gt; And even he COME UNDER A SERVANT MENTALITY that he he was eating the the if he could have, he would have eaten the husk that come off the corn that the that the hogs ate, but he they couldn't even eat that. And his belly WAS EMPTY. AND HE'S STANDING THERE SAYING, "WELL, even the servants eat better than I do." &gt;&gt; HE SAID, "I'LL JUST BE A SERVANT. I'LL GO BACK AND BE A SERVANT." AND HE BEGINS TO GO BACK. THE BIBLE SAID HE CAME TO HIMSELF. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HE COMES TO HIMSELF. AND WHEN HE DID, HE REALIZES, HEY, I I I I'M THE SON OF SOMEBODY WHO WHO'S RICH IN MERCY. &gt;&gt; GLORY TO GOD. SURELY I CAN BE A SERVANT IN MY FATHER'S HOUSE. AND HE GOES BACK DOWN TO THE FATHER'S HOUSE. LISTEN TO ME, YOUNG PERSON. IF YOU'VE DRIFTED AWAY FROM HIM, OLDER PERSON, IF YOU'VE DRIFTED AWAY FROM HIM TONIGHT, YOU MAY HAVE GONE DOWN A LONG ROAD, BUT REMEMBER THE FATHER IS STILL WAITING. &gt;&gt; HE'S STILL THERE. HE DIDN'T LEAVE. He's still there. AND WHEN HE BEGAN TO COME BACK, WHAT DID HE DO? HE GOT TO A PLACE WHEN HE GOT DOWN. WHEN THE FATHER SAW HIM, HE RAN TO HIM. HE SAID, "BRING THE KILL THE FATTED CALF. BRING THE ROBE IN THE RING." WHY? HE WAS STILL A SON. &gt;&gt; He come back said, "I'll just be a servant." And the father said, "No, you won't." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. When did he quit being a son? Never quit being a son. &gt;&gt; He just come to himself. He was quickened. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Them old husk had to become dead to him. &gt;&gt; All his friends had to become dead to him. &gt;&gt; The world had to become dead to him so he could become alive in who he was. &gt;&gt; Amen. But the B said, "Now just think of all that we would have been if it hadn't been for God. But God in his rich mercy, how he has redeemed us tonight. &gt;&gt; Where would we have been tonight if it hadn't been for God's rich mercy upon us? See, God is rich in mercy to make a way for his children. I hope I have time to get through this. We've not been very long so far, so I hope I have time. He talked about Noah, how that God made a way when the world was so lost that that God looked out at the world and he said, "I'll just destroy all of it." He said, "But the Bible says Noah found grace in the eyes of the Lord." &gt;&gt; And God come down to Noah and we've talked about that before, how Noah was chosen by God to keep the human race alive so that we would not all be destroyed. And the Bible tells us that it was during that time, what was it? God made a way for his believing children. There wasn't but just a few of them. But God made a way. What was it? God rich in mercy provided an ark. &gt;&gt; And see, God won't lose nothing that's his. &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? John chapter 6 and verse 39. This is the father's will which hath sent me that of all which he hath given me, I should lose nothing, but should raise it up again at the last day. Again, JOHN 6:44, "NO MAN can come to me except the Father which has sent me. Draw him." Oh, no wonder the SCRIPTURE SAYS, "DRAW ME AND I WILL RUN AFTER THEE." YOU GOT TO BE DRAWN FIRST, &gt;&gt; then run. Listen. He said, "No man can come to me except the Father which has sent me. Draw him and I will raise him up at the last day." God rich in mercy providing a way for his elect to be quickened. Not only quickened in the earnest as we have been, but quickened even in these mortal bodies that our bodies will be changed and be like his glorious body. He said he made a provision for those who wants to be redeemed. He made a provision. Now, I want you to listen to me tonight because I know we have many struggling with and their bodies for healing. And it's such a such an unbelieving age. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Right. This age that we live in is just full of unbelief. &gt;&gt; Yeah. All you have to do is get on the internet and you just get smitten with it. &gt;&gt; Just hits you right in the face. Facebook's full of it. And and the world's full of it. And and even sadly, sometimes you go to Job's Comforters and they're full of it. And sometimes you CAN'T EVEN FIND CHURCH PEOPLE THAT HAVE ANY FAITH. BUT I say, let our faith be INCREASED TONIGHT BECAUSE GOD IS STILL RICH IN MERCY. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HE HE'S NO POORER THAN HE EVER WAS. HE'S JUST AS RICH AS he ever was. &gt;&gt; Right. Look, he he made a provision for those who wants to be healed. And then because that he did this, it makes him rich in mercy as he has always been rich in mercy. He said it must be. But he said if you refuse this, there's nothing left but judgment because sin must be judged. So there's a way of mercy. He illustrated that by the Red Sea. He talked about how that Moses went across AND GOD MADE A WAY. There was no way, but God made a way. How many of you COULD TESTIFY TONIGHT WHEN THERE WAS NO WAY? GOD MADE a way, &gt;&gt; right? And that that's the way we believe for healing. &gt;&gt; LISTEN, HEALING IS NOT ABOUT GOD GIVING YOU LITTLE clues and saying, "Well, you're going to be healed. You're going to be healed." Sometimes he does that for us to help our faith. But really, what it is is when you face an impossible object. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; RIGHT? THERE'S NO WAY THEY could come through the Red Sea. &gt;&gt; No way. THEY COULDN'T BUILD A BOAT THAT WOULD HOLD TWO MILLION PEOPLE. &gt;&gt; Cross that water. They had nothing to build with. THEY WERE IN A DESERT. HOW ARE YOU GOING TO GET ACROSS THE RED SEA? GOD LED THEM THERE, by the way. They get to AN IMPOSSIBLE PLACE. AND WHEN THEY GET THERE, THEY HAVE NO WAY TO CROSS. BUT GOD SAID, "I'LL MAKE A WAY." &gt;&gt; So what does he do? He caused the east wind to blow. Brother said it WAS THE BREATH OF GOD. God looked at the sea with angry eyes and the waves rolled back and here GOES PHARAOH AND TWO MILLION PEOPLE MARCHING ACROSS THE RED SEA. And the Bible says their shoes didn't even get muddy. Amen. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. GOD RICH in mercy. &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad that he is? &gt;&gt; We're having a good time tonight. &gt;&gt; AND SO THEY GET ACROSS, BUT HE SAID PHARAOH WAS AN IMPERSONATOR. &gt;&gt; So Pharaoh said, "Well, if Moses did it, I can do it." &gt;&gt; So Pharaoh starts over and the same water that saved Moses destroyed Pharaoh. NOW, BROTHER BRANDHAM PICKS that up and he says, "So many people are trying to be in the apostolic age." He said, "But they're impersonators." We see that all over the place today, right? People say, "Well, there's this man has healing or this man is Elijah." Right? Now, there's a bunch of prophets saying they're Elijah. &gt;&gt; It seems like an epidemic of it. But we believe God sent Elijah in our day. &gt;&gt; Right? But every prophet says that says that he's Elijah right now. What is it? Impersonators. &gt;&gt; But brother Brandham teaches us in God who is rich in mercy. He says he he says that the apostolic age is for believers only. Right. &gt;&gt; Oh my. He said, "Because you got to be able to look at THE WORD AND FACE UP TO THE WORD. THE APOSTOLIC AGE IS NOT FOR PHARAOH WHO'S STILL IN EGYPT. BUT THE APOSTOLIC AGE, LISTEN, IF THERE'S ANYBODY THAT CAN HAVE HEALING, IT OUGHT TO BE THE PEOPLE OF GOD. IT OUGHT TO BE THE BRIDE OF JESUS CHRIST, &gt;&gt; RIGHT? &gt;&gt; YEAH. &gt;&gt; The apostolic age is for believers only." He said, "God has made a way rich in mercy that his children would not perish. He's made a way for them. He's made a way for you tonight." He said now Pharaoh trying to pursue on. He drowned in the very waters that saved Moses and his group. Moses didn't drown because God is rich in mercy to them who are following his provided way. Tonight, people who don't believe in divine healing, he said, people who don't believe in the baptism of the Holy Ghost, how can they receive anything? HE SAID, "BUT GOD IS RICH IN MERCY to those who will follow after him, not after a creed, but after God." &gt;&gt; Yes, &gt;&gt; God is the word. It was made flesh and dwelt among us now that he might bring forth the other attributes of God. And when any believer comes to God, he becomes God's attribute of his word. I hope we can understand this tonight. He is used to manifest the word that's promised for that day. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; SO GOD WANTS TO EXPRESS SOMETHING in Leodysia. &gt;&gt; HE WANTS TO EXPRESS SOMETHING IN in Hardy, Arkansas, and brother Walt Morgan and each one of you. HE WANTS TO EXPRESS SOMETHING PART OF HIS NATURE, his character. So how does he do it? Through our lives. &gt;&gt; Right? THROUGH OUR LIVES. GOD RICH IN MERCY WANTS TO MANIFEST THE WORD THROUGH US. THAT'S WHY MANY TIMES HE ALLOWS YOU TO GET SICK BECAUSE HE WANTS TO MANIFEST healing in your life. &gt;&gt; He said God rich in mercy has never left us without a testimony. Oh my. Now he begins to explain that. He illustrates it with the brass serpent. You remember the brass serpent that Moses lifted up in the wilderness in the book of Numbers. how that there was a plague that come on the people because of their murmuring and their complaining, their unbelief. And a plague come on them. It was snakes and it went out and it it they bit the people. &gt;&gt; And God said, "Make a serpent out of brass. Put it on a pole." Right. Brass represents judgment. He said, "And if the people will look at the serpent, they'll live." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; That's a strange thing, isn't it? But it was a type of Jesus Christ who would die AND HIS BODY HE WOULD have sin would be judged in his body. Right? So any anyone that looked lived brother said they were so sick that even Dr. Moses none of them could do anything about it. THEY WERE DYING BY THE THOUSANDS. BUT GOD RICH IN MERCY MADE A WAY OF ESCAPE FOR THOSE WHO WOULD BELIEVE HIM. &gt;&gt; He said God is interested in everything. Someone say it WITH ME. EVERYTHING. GOD IS INTERESTED IN EVERYTHING THAT'S WRONG. YOU CAN'T FIND A JOB AND YOU SAY, "WELL, GOD DON'T CARE WHETHER I HAVE A JOB OR NOT." HE'S INTERESTED in everything that's wrong. &gt;&gt; Everything that YOU GO THROUGH, YOU'RE STRUGGLING FINANCIALLY. YOU'RE STRUGGLING WITH YOUR HEALTH. YOU'RE STRUGGLING WITH YOUR CHILDREN. YOU'RE STRUGGLING MAYBE WITH PEOPLE AROUND YOU. GOD IS INTERESTED. MAYBE EVEN IN your mind, YOU'RE STRUGGLING. BUT GOD IS INTERESTED IN EVERYTHING that's wrong. Everything that you anticipate in or participate in, EVERY WALK OF LIFE, GOD IS INTERESTED IN YOU. &gt;&gt; YES. HALLELUJAH. Can Can we BELIEVE THAT TONIGHT? &gt;&gt; GOD IS INTERESTED IN ME. HE'S INTERESTED in you. EVERY WALK OF LIFE, GOD IS INTERESTED in you. YOU ARE HIS CHILD AND HE'S RICH IN MERCY. HE WANTS TO DO FOR YOU. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. NOW, God provided a brass serpent. Now, brother Brandham teaches us and the God is rich in mercy. You go back and listen to it. That brass serpent was later destroyed because they made an idol out of it. &gt;&gt; 2 Kings chapter 18 verse4 is where you'll find that. 2 Kings 18:4. But that was God's provided way at the time, but it became idolatry. But the Brandom explains that he said the people sinned later by taking this same thing that God made an atonement for them. But the brass serpent which represented sin already judged. They idolized that gift and that sinned again. He said God will not share his glory with nobody. Therefore, we can't have no two, three, four gods. There's only one God. He will not share his glory with anything else. He is God alone. So, as the heathens, he said, have many gods. We have the one God. He will not share his glory with another. You understand that we are messiahes. We are miniature gods. The prophets were called gods, &gt;&gt; right? But but there's one god, &gt;&gt; right? one object of worship, &gt;&gt; right? We are gods in the sense that we are a part of him and but we are not worshiped. We don't worship one another. We don't worship prophets. We have one God and he will not share his glory with another. Neither will will he let anything be an idol in front of him. Even though he had made an atonement for the people and it was God's word, it was right. But when they become to idolizing that, then they got in trouble. Now you see how that could get in trouble. Listen to how he says He said, "That's just the same thing." He said, "I think that's happened to our church ages. God sent us the message of Martin Luther with his message, John Wesley, the Pentecostal message, but what did we do with it? The very same thing they did with that brass serpent. We idolized it." Listen, he said, "I belong to this and I belong to that." You see, you belong to something without the sincerity that's connected with genuine godly worship of the word. &gt;&gt; I want to say something tonight. You know, we could we could do that to the message. We could even do that to this church, &gt;&gt; right? You belong to something if we're not careful without the sincerity. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; It's connected with genuine godly worship of the word. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; I've told you before, you can worship, you can be wrong and be sincere, but you can't be right and be insincere. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; You've got to be sincere to be right. &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? &gt;&gt; So, you could be a part of something. You know, prayer line is a We believe in prayer lines. We believe God uses that. &gt;&gt; Yeah. But if you just use it like a like a some kind of a say, well, I'll just go to the prayer line. Everything will be okay. But you're not sincere in it. &gt;&gt; You realize what that is? You belong to something. Oh, we have prayer lines, &gt;&gt; right? But you're not participating in it. You're not you're you're not sincere in it. &gt;&gt; So what IT CAN BECOME AN IDOL &gt;&gt; AND GOD WILL ACTUALLY TAKE THAT AWAY FROM YOU UNTIL YOU LEARN HOW to use it. Right? &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? Anything can become that. A pastor can become that. Yeah, &gt;&gt; a church can become that. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Right. But but but he he had to destroy the idol. &gt;&gt; But he said what happened the Bible, we're told he said that the prophet took that idol and destroyed it. Hallelujah. He said what we need on the scene today is a prophet. I believe we had one &gt;&gt; that will destroy the idol of denominations that thinks they're going into heaven upon belonging to some creed or denomination. LISTEN TO ME, CHURCH. YOU'RE NOT GOING INTO HEAVEN BECAUSE YOU'RE BAPTIST or you're Methodist or you're PENTECOSTAL OR YOU SAY, "I BELONG TO THE MESSAGE." You go to heaven BECAUSE YOU'VE BEEN SAVED by the blood of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He said the prophet took that idol and destroy it. He said, "What we need is A PROPHET WHO WILL DESTROY THE idol denomination. Thinks they're going into heaven upon belonging. Some creed or denomination needs to be destroyed and burn up, throw it away." HE SAID, "GOD IS FULL of mercy. He's rich in mercy." It's it's actually HIS MERCY THAT DESTROYS THE IDOL. &gt;&gt; ARE YOU WITH ME NOW? Because he wants you to be sincere. He wants you to receive your healing. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; He said in that day that when we would have all been in chaos of darkness out there, but God rich in mercy has sent US THE REAL GENUINE HOLY GHOST WITH HIS OWN INTERPRETATION TO IT RIGHT THERE IN THE BUILDING EVERY NIGHT. GOD RICH IN HIS MERCY. How wonderful we find HIM TO BE. DO YOU FIND HIM TO BE wonderful tonight? &gt;&gt; He talked about Luther and Wesley in Pentecost and he said we come into the Pentecostal age and the restoration of the gifts is a very fine thing. It was fine in the age, but we are going beyond that now. We're beyond that just as sure as there's a world. He said, "We got to come beyond this thing because we've done the same thing with it they did before." So, they made an idol out of speaking in tongues. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Right. They made an idol. Some of you have experienced that. You know what what that is? That well, if you speak in tongues, you got it. No matter how you live, &gt;&gt; it becomes an idol. &gt;&gt; Calvin made an idol out of predestination, &gt;&gt; right? Wesley made an idol out of s Wesley didn't, but the people that followed him made an idol out of sanctification, &gt;&gt; right? Pentecostals made an idol out of the gifts, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Some message people make an idol out of the message. &gt;&gt; BUT IF YOU'LL GO BACK TO THE MESSAGE, THE PROPHET DESTROYED THAT THING. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; IF YOU'LL JUST SAY WHAT HE SAID, THERE'S NO IDOL THERE. &gt;&gt; ARE YOU WITH me now? Right? &gt;&gt; He said, "God will send somebody who will smash that thing, tear it to pieces, confirm his word, the full word." &gt;&gt; Notice, PRAISE BE TO GOD. HE SAID, "WE SEE THAT'S TRUE. GOD RICH in his mercy." THEN WHEN THE PROPHET DESTROYED THIS, HE SAID it left them without any sign of healing of an atonement because their idol was destroyed. But God, &gt;&gt; AREN'T YOU GLAD HE'S STILL RICH IN MERCY? EVEN WHEN WE MAKE A MISTAKE, EVEN WHEN WE MAKE AN IDOL OUT OF IT, HE SAID HE'S STILL RICH IN MERCY. &gt;&gt; He said he made them another one. And that next one was the pool of Bethesda. Yeah. &gt;&gt; He said he made them another place of healing &gt;&gt; where the angel would come down at a certain season. You remember the story? And would trouble THE WATER AND THEY WOULD SIT AROUND THAT THAT WATER AND WAIT for the moving of the water and the first one that got in would be healed. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Right. And remember there was a man that sat there for for years. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; AND HE'D BEEN UNABLE TO GO DOWN AND he could he could walk but he just couldn't get there fast enough. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Brandon said he may have had a prostate problem or something. He just couldn't get to the water fast enough. Oh my. I tell you what, in denominations, I couldn't get to the water fast enough. IT WAS A DISAPPOINTING SYSTEM. IT GOD USED IT FOR A WHILE. GOD USED THE SERPENT on a pole. He used the pool of Bethesda. &gt;&gt; It was a It WAS A PROVISION OF MERCY. There was a time brother said the Nazarene church was a wonderful little MOVE OF GOD THAT GOD STARTED, RIGHT? And those CHURCHES WERE STARTED BY GOD. GOD USED IT, but it become an idol to the people. BUT JESUS WALKED AROUND THAT POOL of disappointment. &gt;&gt; COME ON, CHURCH. HE WALKED AMONG ALL THOSE PEOPLE WHO WERE DISAPPOINTED BECAUSE THEY COULDN'T GET INTO THE WATER. AND THE WORD WALKED RIGHT AMONG THEM AND COME TO THE ELECT. &gt;&gt; YES. &gt;&gt; AND SAID, "DO YOU WANT TO BE WELL?" DO YOU REMEMBER WHAT IT WAS LIKE WHEN THE WORD COME BY YOUR WAY AND SAID, "DO YOU WANT TO BE WELL?" AND YOU SAID, "YES, LORD, BUT I DON'T KNOW HOW." HE SAID, "JUST LISTEN TO WHAT I SAY. HEAR THE WORD AND BE WELL." &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. See, God rich in mercy, he said, although they idolized that thing, although the prophet had to tear it up, God made another way for them because he's rich in mercy, he wants them to be healed, and he made a way for their healing. And so, he he goes on to say that the perfect atonement was Jesus Christ. Sin was judged IN HIS BODY. HE WAS THE ANGEL that troubled the waters. He said, "But then God, rich in mercy, sent forth the savior, Jesus Christ. He sent forth Jesus to be both savior and healer. Both the BRASS SERPENT AND THE POOL OF &gt;&gt; BETHESDA. &gt;&gt; Are you with me so far? &gt;&gt; He said he sent him to be savior and healer. For he said as Moses lifted up the brass serpent in the wilderness, so must the son of man be lifted up for the same purpose. He said he THE ATONEMENT. THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE CLAIM UPON. NOTHING BUT THE ATONEMENT. What Jesus purchased by his blood. That's what we have claims upon. So in other words, that's what we can ask for and receive is what he purchased. What does the Bible say? He was wounded &gt;&gt; for our transgressions. &gt;&gt; HE WAS BRUISED FOR OUR INIQUITIES. WE HAVE A CLAIM ON THAT. &gt;&gt; AND BY HIS STRIPES, SOMEONE SAY IT WITH ME. BY HIS STRIPES, I am healed. &gt;&gt; Do we really believe that? The perfect atonement. &gt;&gt; If he saved YOU, IF HE'S AN ATONEMENT FOR YOUR SALVATION, HE'S ALSO AN ATONEMENT FOR YOUR HEALING. &gt;&gt; RIGHT? &gt;&gt; GOD RICH in mercy, &gt;&gt; didn't leave us. Listen, he didn't ever say, "Well, you'll have the word, but no spirit. You'll you'll have the the theology, but you won't have any way to receive YOUR HEALING." NO, HE DID NOT LEAVE US WITHOUT A way for healing. &gt;&gt; God rich in mercy. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It was an eternal atonement. He said he this has to be this was to be an eternal atonement because he came himself. God came in the form of sinful flesh to make an eternal atonement and suffered in the flesh and made the atonement and returned back in the form of the Holy Ghost to confirm that atonement. He said where no brass SERPENT OR NO TROUBLED WATER COULD DO IT. HE SAID IT ALL POINTED TO THE PERFECT ATONEMENT. God rich in his mercy has did this. Denomination come along and unbelief increased and the atonement WAS OBSCURED BY A VEIL OF TRADITION. BUT GOD RICH IN MERCY RENT THE VEIL WHEN THE MIGHTY GOD CAME IN PLAIN VIEW. &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me today? The fullness OF THE WORD CAME IN PLAIN VIEW THERE ON CALVARY. AND IN THIS DAY, THE FULLNESS OF THE WORD CAME IN PLAIN VIEW. What did it do? WHAT DID GOD DO? HE SENT A MESSAGE. GOD RICH IN MERCY. The message ISN'T A DRUDGERY. IT'S NOT A BOOK OF RULES, BUT GOD RICH IN MERCY. &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY WE LOVE IT. THAT'S WHY I'M NOT AFRAID TO MENTION THE NAME OF BROTHER BRANDHAM. THAT'S WHY I'M NOT AFRAID TO DO THAT'S WHY I'M NOT AFRAID TO BELIEVE IN A PROPHET. IT'S WHY I'M NOT AFRAID TO BELIEVE THE MESSAGE. IT'S WHY I'M NOT AFRAID TO READ QUOTES FROM THE PULPIT. COME ON, CHURCH. I'M NOT AFRAID TO DO WHAT A PROPHET SAID. I'M NOT AFRAID BECAUSE HE WAS A WORD PROPHET. HE TOOK US BACK TO THE SCRIPTURES. GOD RICH IN MERCY PROVIDED A WAY. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; I DON'T WANT WHAT THE DENOMINATION'S GOT. I don't WANT TO GO BACK. I WAS A DUCK. I WAS MADE TO SWIM. &gt;&gt; YES. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. I WAS AN EAGLE. I WAS MADE TO FLY. Are you with me now? &gt;&gt; What did the message do? He said the messenger, he said Malachi 4, Revelation 10:7, he said, "Say, behold the lamb of God who takes AWAY THE SIN OF THE WORLD." &gt;&gt; YES. &gt;&gt; I wish we'd become so familiar with it that we could quote it. &gt;&gt; Behold the lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world. &gt;&gt; OH, HE SAID, "NOT BEHOLD MY METHODIST, MY BAPTIST, MY PENTECOSTAL, BUT BEHOLD THE LAMB." YEAH. &gt;&gt; WHAT WAS IT? THE MESSAGE POINTING US AWAY FROM A POOL OF BETHESDA, AWAY FROM A BRASS SERPENT DESTROYING THOSE IDOLS AND SAYING, "HERE IS THE PERFECT ATONEMENT. HERE IS THE FULL WORD." DO YOU BELIEVE IT TONIGHT? EVERYTHING YOU HAVE NEED OF IS RIGHT HERE IN THE WORD OF GOD. EVERYTHING THE WORD HAS BEEN OPEN TO US IN THIS DAY. And we believe that word. If he said, "I'M HEALED," THEN I'M HEALED AND I'M GOING to believe it. He was talking to a sister there after the prayer line and God and um and then God was rich in mercy and he told her he said you've been trying to believe. He said but you got to quit trying to believe. Just do it. &gt;&gt; Just believe. He said it either is or it isn't. &gt;&gt; It's either the truth or it's a false. &gt;&gt; And if it's the truth, you're healed. &gt;&gt; Come on. That's right. &gt;&gt; Come on, CHURCH. YOU'RE ALREADY HEALED. &gt;&gt; YEAH. &gt;&gt; I believe it's the truth. Hallelujah. What did he do? He said, "Lest I come and smite the earth with a curse, behold, I send Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the Lord, God rich in mercy." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. What does the message do as we're closing? It points to that perfect atonement, &gt;&gt; right? That that that new and Old Testament come together. That that open book, that that two-winged eagle. Are you with me now? &gt;&gt; That perfect atonement, that that one who CAN HEAL YOU AND save you. That one who's here today to do it. He's bringing us back. What does Ephesians chapter 2 says? We'll read the next two verses. Ephesians 2:6. And hath raised us up together. God rich in mercy hath raised us up together, made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus, that in the ages to come, he might show the exceeding riches of his grace in his kindness toward us THROUGH CHRIST JESUS. WHAT WAS IT? GOD RICH IN MERCY, BRINGING US BACK TO HIS PERFECT ATONEMENT. &gt;&gt; I was listening to that sermon as I was preparing for this as it was just fell in line with our what we had to deal with tonight. And I I'm listening to that and I just kept listening over and over to a spot on that tape towards the end where he says and I played it before church spot on the tape where he says some of you have heart trouble the doctors can't do anything about. He said but God rich in mercy. &gt;&gt; He said that same God is here tonight. He said some of you have cancer the doctors can't do anything about but God rich in mercy. Some of you heard that before THE SERVICE. HE'S STILL RICH IN mercy tonight. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. God provided Elijah to call us back to a perfect atonement. Healing is here. &gt;&gt; That's not just a song. That's a reality. &gt;&gt; ELIJAH COME AND TEAR DOWN THE IDOLS OF BAAL and rebuild the altar of God. &gt;&gt; So we could have a perfect atonement. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He didn't come to give us another idol. He come to point us to the one who could make our hearts right. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. to turn our hearts back to the perfect &gt;&gt; atonement musicians, if you would come. I I just it just thrilled my heart. And I know we have some in need of healing, but I needed healing, too. He healed my soul. &gt;&gt; That was the perfect atonement that did that. The full word did that. I don't believe anything else can do that in this age. I don't You can run around, people go different places and say, "Well, I'll try this church and that church." But if you're an eagle, there's one thing that can heal your soul. &gt;&gt; And there's something missing. As long as you're running from place to place and and pillar to post, there's something missing. But one day, if you could ever get the smell of water, hallelujah. The Bible said that seed await in the earth, it'll sit there. BUT THROUGH THE SIN OF WATER, IT'LL bud come forth. Oh, Elijah the prophet restored back a perfect atonement. So we could lay our hands on it as brother Joel preached Sunday night. We could identify with it. &gt;&gt; And we're not just talking about something that happened 2,000 years ago, but a GOD THAT WAS ALIVE TODAY. WHAT WAS IT THAT HE SHOWED US? THE SIGN OF THE RESURRECTION THAT HE WAS STILL ALIVE. HE'S STILL THE SAME God as he always was. Do you believe it tonight? Amen. Could we stand together?
