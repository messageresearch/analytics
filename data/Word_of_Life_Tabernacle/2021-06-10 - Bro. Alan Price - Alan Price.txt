lord we pray for our pastor god you just protect him and his family all those that are traveling pray just be with them as well pray just give those that came out tonight those that are listening and watching just give them a special blessing lord that that we would just be lights that would shine in this hour and our purpose and goal would just be to just sacrifice ourselves to you daily in jesus christ's name we pray amen amen you love the lord this evening if you would turn with me to romans chapter 8 and verse 1. let me just read a quick scripture here and i wrote down i want to remember it was my wife's 30th birthday yesterday so happy birthday to her she uh she joined the 3-0 club and doesn't want me to tell anybody but i'm going to so hey man no i've been really blessed it was her birthday yesterday so we we got to spend the day together mom watched the kids so it was really nice to have a glimpse of what it was like before children and it's really funny we were sitting there eating and just wondering what our kids were doing so you know but i definitely appreciate my wife i wouldn't be where i am if it wasn't for her and definitely blessed and i married up amen so if you would with me turn with me to romans chapter eight and verse one and no i'm not in trouble that i'm talking about my wife so i'm not trying to dig myself out anything i'm just being honest so i seen stuart back there looking a little bit but so i'd like to preach this even if we could on the same spirit romans 8 and verse 1 there is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in christ jesus who walked not after the flesh but after the spirit for the law of the spirit of life in christ jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death for what the law could not do in that it was weak through the flesh god sending his own son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin condemned sin in the flesh that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us who walk not after the flesh but in this but after the spirit and with that with the reading of word you can have your seats this evening i won't take up much of your time this evening just have a little thought on my heart and kind of had been studying studying something else and and the lord just kind of changed it just at the last moment and kind of went this direction so i just pray it's for someone here amen that god would just speak to your speak to your heart i'd like to look on the same spirit if i could tonight i'm going to reread that scripture and just kind of continue on down through down through the scripture here and and just just pour out our hearts just a little bit this evening and so back to verse one it says there is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in christ jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit and we know as believers when we when we surrender our lives to christ our our whole life goal changes from walking after the flesh to walking after the spirit is that right now it's it's not that we quit our jobs we're not that we quit our relationships quit our friends or or do this now those that are bad influences we might we might pull ourselves away from but but we're not ending everything here but our main focus is is to walk after christ is that right now in verse 2 for the law of the spirit of the life in christ jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death so we see in that scripture there there's two laws the law of the spirit of the life in christ jesus and then the law of sin and death now for what the law could not do in that it was weak through the flesh god sending his own son in likeness of sinful flesh for sin condemned sin in the flesh that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit and that's not our righteousness it's not the righteousness of brother steward or not the righteousness of brother caleb not allen's righteousness but it's the righteousness of jesus christ is that right we ought not think highly of ourselves we not to think we're better than this one or that one we all had to come the same way and that's through the blood of jesus christ is that right he says for they are the for they that are after the flesh do mine the things of the flesh but they that are after the spirit the things of the spirit and so we know that when we had a nature change the flesh was no longer in charge but it was the holy ghost on the inside controlling the flesh is that right for to be carnally minded as death and but to be spiritually minded is life and peace because the carnal mind is enmity against god for it is not subject to the law of god neither indeed can be so then they that are in the flesh cannot please god but you're not in the flesh but in the spirit if so be that the spirit of god dwell in you now if any man have not the spirit of christ he is none of his and if christ be in you the body is dead because of sin but the spirit is life because of righteousness but if the spirit of him that raised jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit that dwell in you so we see that that scripture if we have the same spirit that christ had the same one that raised him from the dead will raise us from the dead as well is that right so we see that there's two laws the law of sin and death and then the law this of the spirit of life in christ jesus now we see in the garden of eden when adam and eve when the fall took place adam had a conditional covenant with with god is that right and the condition was to eat not of the fruit of the tree of good and evil is that right that was the condition if you look through the scripture you see other conditional promises that god made it was just like samson he had the condition not to cut his hair is that right and and so he could have his strength he could do all these mighty things as long as he did not do the conditional covenant that god had made and we see down through our lives you make you know we make promises you know i i promise to pay this much to buy this item from you or i promise to do this for you if you'll do this for me and we see those are on conditions you know i'm not going to say i'm selling an item i'm not going to sell you this unless you promise to pay me a specific amount is that right now we look at many times in our human walk how many times we actually break a promise i know as far as a parent goes i feel like i break promises all the time because you know i tell brother ben yes i'll be here sunday then a kid gets sick and i'm not here now that's something that i couldn't control or something i didn't i didn't foresee but it still i broke that promise that i was going to be here if i tell my kids after work we'll we'll go down to the creek and we'll play and we'll have a good time well then i have a really rough day at work a long day at work and when i get home i'm too tired and so i break that promise and so we see that those are on conditions you know i i should have said if daddy feels good when he gets home if he's not tired if he's not wore out then we'll go to the creek and that's on condition is that right now and men begin trying to get back in after the garden of eden after adam and eve were kicked out of the garden of eden we see immediately men begin trying to get back to eternal life trying to get back to god and we see that through cain and abel and we see that cain had begun to had had begin to worship just as abel was beginning to worship and brother branham says and i will restore in 53 says anyhow when the angel began to pull his flaming sword out out to guard this tree of life he says now watch cain and abel both came to find favor with god he says amen he says now look cain was a long ways from being a communist neither was he an atheist but cain was a believer he said get on your shock proof vest now he said cain was a believer and a worshiper of god and so we see if we look at it cain actually worked harder in his worship than abel did cain he grew the fruits he tilled the ground he did these things and he brought the sacrifice to god and he said and brother branham goes on he says now if god only required a believer cain was just as as just as a believer as abel was and he said and god would be unjust if he condemned cain for his faith in him and accepted abel he says if faith was all he required he says all right but cain came and offered a sacrifice now look cain built an altar a church cain made a sacrifice just the same as abel did and cain worshipped he never come as an unbeliever he come as a believer he raised his hands and worshiped god just the same as abel did he says well if a church membership an altar and a worship or a sacrifice is all god requires then cain was just as able was but we see there was something different is that right abel had a revelation of what god required is that right that's why you know i don't believe legalism will get you anywhere it's got to be a change on the inside that changes the outside is that right i love this brother branham says and believe us though this he says you don't entice god by the way you dress you entice god by the way you live think and act you believe that this evening so we see that legalism wasn't enough to change somebody that it was that was enough to change a person wasn't enough to change the soul you can dress the right way you can talk the right way walk the right way do everything the right way and still die and go to hell and what a shame it would be to do all those things and not accept the spirit of the living god in this day so we see that legalism won't get you anywhere and i'm not here to just preach all grace and all legalism or or this or that and i really like how brother josh said it he he spoke saturday night and and just did a terrific job and if you if you want to get a tape to listen to i'd highly recommend that one or cd um um i still have an old enough truck that i have a tape player but uh but if you want to get the cd on that i'm sure it was good but he preached on judging him faithful and it was just an amazing service but he put that you know he wasn't preaching greasy grace or that you can do anything but once you meet christ it'll change your life to where you'll live told to the message is that right now brother braham says and i will restore in 53 says if you belong to a church or go to church or got your name on a church book and a good tithe player a worshiper he said sincerity says still that isn't it he said that's right he said i don't want to hurt you but i've got to stand before judgment with you and god requires more than that and cain was just as able was if that was all that god required you know a lot of people it used to be you know if i just go to church i'll go to heaven and now anymore you don't even have to go to church to get into heaven you just have to be a good person you just have to do this or do that and now it seems to be in this age people don't even care if they go to heaven anymore and so we see that down through time it just seems like the age gets darker and darker and he continues on he says now i want you to notice cain built his big fine altar and he says i can imagine him being a tiller of the soul filled it full of easter flowers and everything and made it beautiful and he was the nature of satan and today we have chimes on the churches and plus pews and and everything else trying to find favor with god and that's not god's way of finding favor he said every easter you go to church and they did and bid you merry christmas because they won't see you anymore until arm full of easter flowers and throw them on the altar and or they won't see you anymore till christmas and come easter you show off the new hat or new bonnet or new suit of clothes and bring up an armful of easter flowers and then and then throw them on the altar god doesn't want easter flowers on the altar he wants you on the altar he says you're the one that belongs on the altar so we see that god doesn't care about the outside he doesn't care about the pomp and prim things that we want to do he cares about the soul of an individual is that right that's why you've got to get christ to change you it's not the law that can change you but it's the grace that changes you from the inside out now i'm not against a holy life you must have a nature change to bring about that holy life and what i mean by that is is you know you can dress like i could dress up like a football player i could put on a helmet and pads and everything and walk out to the nfl but something on the inside ain't right i'm gonna get crushed i'm gonna get destroyed because what's on the inside doesn't match what's on the outside is that right and so now if you've got an nfl player and they put on the pads and the helmet and everything else and they go out there they can make a difference and so as a christian it's not good enough just to dress like one or act like one or sing like one or talk like one it's the soul it's the spirit on the inside when you come up against the enemy it's that spirit that satan recognizes and realizes that he has to move and get out of the way is that right now we see that cain and abel offered their sacrifice and they had to be identified within their sacrifice and so we see that cain was not identified in abel's sacrifice nor was abel identified in cain's sacrifice is that right that's why i couldn't make it in on my parents you can't make it in on your parents you can't make it in on your husband your wife it's got to be you identified with a sacrifice that you bring before cry before god is that right he said it's back to god's original decision at the first conference in eden he said back to the blood he said the jew in the old days he says now i'm coming down home for pentecost in just a few minutes he said in the old days when god accepted this substitute he says how the jew used to come down the road with a slick bull a sick bullock and he would say you know i'm a sinner and jehovah requires me to offer blood so he goes and gets his lamb for his bullock and he takes it down to the high priest down to the temple and he lays his hands upon his sacrifice he says what does that do he says it identifies the worshiper with his sacrifice and as believers in this day we have to be identified with our sacrifice and who was our sacrifice it was jesus christ is that right so we have to be identified with him in this day and he says and the priest comes and kills the bullock and catches the blood and sprinkles it upon them and he said the worshiper sincerely knowing he says this jew and that's what jehovah required of him he says the man went home with a good feeling he said filling the quivering and shaking of the lamb the blood spraying all over his hands and so forth and see that little fellow kicking and dying as they cut his throat he said he know that that ought to have been him he looked at his sacrifice and he identified himself by the laying his hands upon it he said i should be that one and then when it they cut his throat dying and bleeding and going on he says oh the little fellow quivering and and quieting down and the worshiper standing there and saying oh jehovah you've accepted that instead of me and i'm ashamed of myself and when the man went home justified is because he had done exactly what jehovah required that was fine so we see back in the old testament that was okay because that's what god required is that right but that's not what god requires in this day hebrews 10 and verse 1 for the law having a shadow of good things to come and not the very image of things can never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually to make the comers there and too perfect so we see that the the sacrifices of the bulls and goats was a shadow of the good thing to come for you and i is that right but even in the scripture says with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually could not make the comers there unto perfect now in the second verse is for then when they uh for then would they have not ceased to be offered because that the worshipers once purged should have no more conscience of sins but in those sacrifice there was a remembrance again made of sin every year for it is not possible that the blood of bulls and goats could take away sin so we see that it was just a covering of the sin but every year there was a made a remembrance through that sacrifice of the sin is that right but as believers in jesus christ as that as our sacrifice trying not to get ahead of myself here but there's no more remembrance of sin now you may remember that sin you may remember the things that you used to do the person you used to be but god has put it in a sea of forgetfulness never to be brought up again as that right and i believe that brother branham says it was laid back upon the back of the accuser and everything that you had done he will now be judged for is that right are you thankful for that today amen do you love the lord this evening amen we did at work today and just to just kind of give you this just here for a few moments we did this thing at work it's called predictive index and it and it allows you to to identify the behavioral tendencies in people and so um i wasn't a really big believer of it at first but then they they ask you to do it and it's just a bunch of algorithms and you go out and you fill all these questions out and you just answer question after question after question and it's called predictive index and it's pretty neat um and you know it doesn't change a person it just tells you who they are and so you know looking at mine today i'm a very um i'm not a team work person now i love teamwork but i work better alone i don't like to be judged for other people's mistakes if we're doing a group project i want to make sure people know what part of that project i did and that sounds selfish but they identify that in you because they know don't put allen with a team because he's going to try to either take charge or run off and just leave the team and there are people like that and there's other people the lady that i sat next to we were complete polar opposites she was team oriented she didn't like conflict i was not team oriented and i could deal with conflict it wasn't i said i didn't like conflict but i'd rather get it over with she wanted to sweep it under the rug and never deal with it i wanted to just go ahead and talk about it get it over with and throw it behind him and so we see that each individual as humans our human nature we have predictive we have indexes that that rule our human nature is that right you know i look at look at matinee and paxton and piper and i can't discipline them the same all just across the board that everything is disciplined i just learned this one the same this one the same and this one the same because they have different natures you know one you can say one thing too and it just breaks their heart they break down one you have to beat the other one we're just not sure yet we know she's going to be tougher than the other two so so you really don't know you have to treat each one separately is that right and so we look and that's why jesus loves a multi-membered body because each one has a position and a place each one has a purpose in the body of jesus christ now what i'm going to say that for is because i can look at my predictive index and see what type of a person that i am now they say how difficult it is to change the the type of person you are what they call the behaviorals and needs and so the further you are away from the midline the harder it is to change and so they like a type a is dominance and so if it's far right that's a really dominant person if it's far left that's not a dominant person and and so they go through all these things and the further you are from this line the harder it is to change and so you know and and you know they they like people to use this in their marriages raising their children and in hiring people and and it is a really good tool because it identifies where to place people you know if you've got a team oriented person you probably want them to be in management over people if you've got a goal-oriented person or a self-individual person or self-starter you want to put them over in this position and you want them to not be troubled by anybody else and so we see that our human nature can get in the way of what our christ-like nature needs to be is that right and it's very difficult to change but the holy ghost is the only way you're going to overcome that nature and so what i'm trying to say is no matter how far right or how far left you are the holy ghost is the only thing that i know of on the on on the earth that can actually control human nature and that's jesus christ right now we see that that was just a covering i'm going to get back to my notes now and and brother branham says in the philadelphia and church age he says israel used to take the red heifer and sacrifice her upon the altar for the remission of sins for a year the the he said the sins of the guilty was was covered for one year he said but that covering could not take away the desire of sin so that's the important piece it could not take away the desire of sin it could cover the sin but it couldn't take away that nature that that desire to to go back out and recommit the sin and so it says so each year the man would sacrifice or excuse me it was not a perfect offering it was just a shadow until the real one came along you thankful for the real one this evening he said so each year the man would sacrifice and each year come back because he still had the same desire to sin and the life of the animal atoned for that sin but being the animal blood that was shed in the animal life that was given it could not come back upon the man and it says if it had come back it still would not be availed but when christ the perfect substitute was given his blood was shed and then the life that was in christ came back upon the repentant sinner and that life being perfect of christ sinless and righteous then the guilty one could go free for he had no desire to sin the life of jesus had come back upon him he said see that's what it means in romans 8 2 the law of the spirit of life in christ jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death now we know as believers that that whenever we are saved and filled with the holy ghost that doesn't mean you're not tempted right i know many of us are tempted daily we're tempted and tried and and it doesn't mean that every life's going to be perfect and you're no longer even going to have a desire to do anything bad or not even be tempted to do anything wrong or tempted to say anything or talk or gossip or do any of this that's not what the promise said but it's it takes away that desire when the holy spirit comes it takes away that desire to sin that iniquity to for us to go out and purposely sin do you understand that this evening amen do you love the lord i mean are you thankful for that perfect sacrifice hebrews 10 and 10. he says now by the which we are all sanctified through the offering of the body of jesus christ once and for all and every priest standeth daily ministering and offering often times the same sacrifices which can never take away sins but this man after he had offered one sacrifice for sins forever setting down at the right hand of god and i love this albert barnes and his notes here he says but this man and he goes back to the greek and his notes say the lord jesus he said this word man is not in the original uh here he says it's not the greek greek literal meaning for man but it's the greek greek literal meaning for priest so it says but this priest the lord jesus but this man after he'd offered one sacrifice for sins forever sat down at the right hand of god so he was saying that that was our high priest do you believe that and it said after he had offered one sacrifice for sins by dying on the cross he did this but once for it was sufficient for the sins of the world so we see that when he done this there was nothing else that could happen that that blood could not cover is that right there was nothing you could do nothing i could do that could get to could go to a situation where the blood was not powerful enough to take that sin away and wash it completely from the believer do you believe that well on down to verse 13 and from henceforth expecting till his enemies be made his footstool he says for by what offering he hath perfected forever them that are sanctified are you thankful for that he said whereof the holy ghost also was a witness to us that after he had said before this is the covenant that i will make with them after those days saith the lord i will put my laws into their hearts and in their minds will i write them and their sins and iniquities will i remember no more and so i'm thankful for that that everything that we had committed everything that we had done wrong is laid back upon the accuser and he will be judged that day for those things and so we see that it will be remembered no more by god is that right now i looked here and i just did some numbers i like numbers and it doesn't mean anything i'm not typifying anything but if each israelite made a sacrifice just for for one year during the 40-year period in the wilderness that have been about 80 million sacrifices and so we and i'm looking at the the 2 million so we're looking at the children of israel if they made one sacrifice every year for 40 years that's around 80 million sacrifices and if i did the math right if not i'm a banker so forgive me but millions of gallons of blood that was spilled but that was still not enough is that right but when christ came it was one sacrifice it was enough to do away with the sins of not just you and i but of the whole world do you believe that today so it says we see whenever that when that spirit of christ whenever that blood was shed it wasn't just shed for the covering of sins it wasn't just shed for this or for that or for our healing but it was to bring that life back upon the believer when he raised from the dead and that spirit that holy ghost was given back in measure to you and i that's what it was about amen so you see you must be born again and we know that if there's a seed in there the word we're quick in it is that right if you if you come to church and no matter who's preaching if they're preaching the word of god you know that if you've got a seed in your heart if you've got a seed in your soul the the word will quicken that seed is that right you know if i went out tomorrow and bought just some potting soil and it had no seed in it no no nothing had no seeds and i began to water it nothing's going to come up is that right but you put a little grain of grass in there a little seed a little flower something like that you pour some water on it and it will come to life is that right you get into get it into the atmosphere of the sun and and things will begin to happen do you believe that do you love the lord this evening i mean my wife yesterday we were walking around and we were looking at plants and she's like i was like what do you want to buy something she's like no i'm just looking at the ones that if we got we'd take them home and kill them and and so you know we we're not we're not green thumb people you know my mom she can she can grow flowers and stuff and me and jen have tried for 10 years i don't think we've had one plant ever make it more than a year we've tried we just we just don't have that about us now that doesn't mean we're bad at other things just like the predictive index we have our strengths and we have our weaknesses and i believe as christians you know that's one thing many times um uh one thing that this predictive index i really like and i was in it a lot today for about eight hours and so i may talk about a little bit but it identifies your weaknesses very well and so a lot of people like to hide from their weaknesses like put them in the closet i'm gonna talk about it and then in their mind all they focus on is their weaknesses right and so the good thing is is as christians you know and as husband and wife and parents you ought to identify the weaknesses and you ought to work on those it's not something we hide or you know it's something we may be ashamed of but we ought to try to become better not not we focus on them now we do this or that but we ought to recognize them and then try to become better is that right you know if you you know me i'm i'm hard-headed and uh you know my predictive index says i'm impatient and and and so i was like you know those are true and some people when somebody calls me and wants a loan done and they want it that day and patience is good because i go and fight and try to get it done but if i'm trying to load up the car with the kids and my wife being impatient is not a good thing and so you have to identify these strengths and these weaknesses and then you have to recognize them and you have to know when to use them when to assert them and and how how it goes with your family how it goes with your work life and even how it goes into your church life because a lot of people come into the church not being spiritually minded still thinking about the things that happen at work just like i may be even doing tonight still thinking about the things that happen at home and when we come into the church we ought to be so focused on christ that none of those things matter is that right that whenever the pastor is preaching whenever he's speaking up here that he's not having to fight through this or fight through that because we've come prepared we've we've been like ground that's been tilled by the tiller or dissed up and we're ready to receive what god has got for us is that right now brother brahm says in the token in 1964 he says now our sacrifice today not only an ordinary human being but it was god himself that was identified in flesh here upon the earth and when that blood cell was broke not only did the soul of man or a spirit of man but it was god himself who was identified in that man returns back upon the believer in the baptism of the holy spirit so we spoke about this a little bit last week the same life that was in christ now is in the believer not in the not in the same measure that he had it but we still have a measure of that life of christ now he said that's the token that god requires today the token of today that we have to have must be the holy spirit that's god's required token he said we'll prove it to you by the scriptures he said without the holy spirit you do not display the token he said that is he said that's the token show that he says that you have been identified yourself with your sacrifice and god has sent you back the token to show that you've been accepted he said until that's done no matter how good you are how much you know he said how a college professor a good person a preacher whatever it might be you're absolutely not recognized until you can show the token so we see that to be identified with our sacrifice we must show the token is that right we must have that life of christ the holy ghost living in on the inside of us on that control tower is that right you know we can say well i went to church well so did cain you know i sang well so did cain i dressed right well so did cain i did this so did cain but it's all about that sacrifice is that right it was the revelation of what we needed to be worshipping in is that right he said in the token continue on down he says we have to identify ourselves with our sacrifice we have to be identified in his death when a jew placed his hand upon the sacrifice he was identifying himself transferring his sins to his sacrifice and the sacrifice died he says now we place our hands by faith upon jesus christ and are identified with him in his death not only in his death but if we're accepted we're identified not only in his death but in his resurrection by the life that was in him is sent back upon the believer and that's what satan can't stand because he can't defeat christ and he knows if you've got christ in you he can't defeat you he said it's sent back upon the believer as a token a memorial that the death has passed from it and that god has sealed you into the kingdom of god until the day of your redemption he says ephesians 4 30. so we see that once we're sealed into the day of redemption no one can break that seal not even god is that right amen are you thankful for the spirit of the lord this evening amen i promise i won't hold you very much longer but just kind of want to get through this tonight and kind of go and just kind of you know it's nothing new i know it's nothing you haven't heard before i know it's something that you've been taught on but i think it's something we should revisit it was laid upon my heart so i pray that god will just maybe just inspire you by this and maybe do something good in your life and romans 5 and verse 19 if we can go there and just look at that here sister joanna if we could i'll just kind of break down the scripture and go through it so romans 5 and verse 19 for as by one man's disobedience many were made sinners so by the obedience of one shall many be made righteous so we see that when when the fall took place in the garden all mankind was cast out is that right there was no more direct connection with god there was a there was a barrier put up that we had to find a way and man began searching immediately to get back to god and and abel had come to the revelation of what god had done in the garden for adam and eve by when they covered themselves with fig leaves when they made their own homemade religion as brother branham says god come down and sacrificed through death so that they might live is that right so we see that for by one man's disobedience many were made sinners so by the obedience of one shall many be made righteous not that we're righteous within ourselves but that we take on the righteousness of jesus christ in verse 20 moreover the law entered that the offense might abound so what that is saying is once the law entered there were more offenses because without law there's no offenses is that right if there was no speed limit i could not get a speeding ticket is that right and now this is where a lot of people come into legalism and and grace because they say well if you preach this then nobody will live right but i always go back to if they're not in christ they can live legalistic and still not make it so you've gotta you know you can have legalism and still fall you can have greasy grace and still fall but if you have christ you'll never fall is that right so we see that that but where sin abounded grace did much more abound now i love this because the scripture says you know god's grace is sufficient and i began to study that scripture a long time ago and i preached on it a little bit ago and and i looked at the word sufficient and it just means just enough and when i think of god i don't think of just enough i think of more than enough overwhelmingly enough but when you look at grace that's why it says grace is sufficient because it's not greasy grace he's not just throwing out grace so that you can go live any way you want to he knew you from the beginning he knew what you would do he knew what you would choose and through predestination knew that you would choose him and so we see that when his grace is sufficient it covers your sin is that right it's not out there just covering any sin that's not out there just pouring around and it's just grace for everyone grace for everyone it has to be grace that you've been identified with your sacrifice to receive that grace so we see that grace did much more abound in verse 21 that as sin hath reigned unto death even so might grace reign through righteousness unto eternal life by jesus christ our lord so where before sin had reigned unto death saying that that sin had cast us out to wear eternal life where adam and eve could have lived eternally in the garden when they were cast out then they begin to die from that moment forward mankind was born and then they would die born and die and so we see that once that grace come through the righteousness unto eternal life by jesus christ our lord and that was him being dying going to hell and raising again defeating death hell in the grave and that someday you and i will take a rapture just like enoch is that right we'll be here one day and then all of a sudden we'll be gone is that right so we see that that's not any that's not greasy grace that's the perfect grace of jesus christ now brother branham says he says and he's preaching and what is the holy ghost and i've seen this and i just love it he said there's never been anything on earth yet that would ever defeat satan like the word of god you can take a preacher and he can preach that won't defeat it you can take a singer and they can sing that won't defeat it but the word of god will defeat satan every time in every condition in every circumstance do you believe that amen whenever this grace come whenever jesus whenever this sacrifice hit it was something the devil had never seen before because there was still a remembrance of sin but once christ come that believer was separated from that sin and was given the righteousness of jesus christ and so if we could now we'll go to romans chapter 8 and verse 1 and kind of go down through this scripture here just for a few moments amen do you love the lord this evening you know that's another thing and i just break it up just while she gets those scriptures we'll go down all the way to verse 11 but you know i never realized how hard it was as a parent how to get anything out of church you know i feel like you know for the last five or six years it's just been you've been just getting little nuggets and little bits and pieces and you know i remember i would just being able to study i would come home and and i feel so guilty now working and having a family and then trying to study and used to i just had loads of time to study and just could sit back in my recliner and you know i get home today and popper's pulling the plug out of the computer hitting power and just doing all these things and and you know it's it's just the way life is is that right but that doesn't mean we should give up you know i could have took the bad attitude which i've done before probably last week did more than this week and i just took the bad attitude just like whatever happens happens you know and the spirit of the lord can't work with that right we can't just say well whatever happens happens we've got to come and be like-minded with christ is that right now romans 8 1 says there is therefore now no condemnation to them that believe which are in christ jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit so there's no condemnation to them that believe that are in christ jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit so that means we're walking after the spirit of christ which means we're not walking after the things the flesh wants we're not walking after the things that that the world is desiring but we're walking in the spirit of jesus christ and romans 8 2 again for the law the spirit of life in christ jesus had made me free from the law of sin and death for what the law could not do is weak through the flesh god sending his own son in likeness of sinful flesh for sin condemned sin in the flesh and i know i've read this through but i want to read it again that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit so we see that the righteousness of the law had to be fulfilled but who did it have to be fulfilled in you and i so we walk not after the flesh but after the spirit he says for they that are after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh but they that are after the spirit the things of the spirit now you can get around somebody and begin to talk and you can realize very quickly if you're if you're attentive that what that person is interested in you know i can i can go up and meet somebody new and if i get to talking to them and i'm not really being the one that's talking i'm just asking them about themselves you can find real quick what's important to a person is that right um and so we look here and and you know if you if you go up to somebody that's maybe um they like sports you know i set by a guy today and he was wanting to talk sports to me i don't watch sports i could care less and i was like i really wish i could talk to you about it but i can't you know now if he wanted to talk hunting and fishing i could sit there all day right and so we see that that's not that hunting and fishing is better and sports are worse or this is the flesh and this is not the flesh but you can find what a person likes if you just listen to them just for a moment and if we're not careful as christians we can get caught up in those things that we genuinely like that are not sin is that right like i love to you know i love to budget i love to look at finances i love to be in the outdoors i love to do those things and i can get caught up doing those things and not focusing on really what i need to be which is the word of god now we see here if we go on down i believe in verse 5 yeah and so we see that for they that are after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh but they that are after the spirit the things of the spirit so we never want to get to where we're so spiritual that we can't talk to one another is that right you know you say well how was your day and they just you know they start you know quoting scripture to you it's very hard to communicate with that type of person but we ought to be spiritually minded is that right now verse six for to be carnally minded as death but to be spiritually minded is life and peace but the carnal mind is enmity against god for it is subject to the law of god neither indeed can be so then they that are in the flesh cannot please god but ye are not in the flesh but in the spirit if so be that the spirit of god dwell in you so if the spirit of god dwell in you then you please god he says now if any man have not the spirit of christ he is none of his and if christ being you the body is dead because of sin and the spirit is the li is life because of righteousness but if the spirit of him that raised jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised christ from the dead shall quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit that dwell in you so how will he quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit is that right so it's got to be the same spirit that christ had that's the only way we're going to make a rapture is if we have that same spirit if you have a different spirit the same spirit that raised christ from the dead is not going to contact your spirit it's going to contact the same one that had already raised from the dead so that you and i can take a rapture do you believe that brother braham says in 65 and the easter seal he says my redeemer is living now and then he said and someday when he comes these bones shall rise again to go meet him in the air he said you may bury me in the sea burn it up whatever you want to do that quickening power is eternal he says whoo i feel like easter right now he says yes sir i've had it for years it's in me he says it's in you and he says if you that the spirit the race jesus from the dead dwells in your mortal bodies it will quicken you from the things of the world to the word of god only not to a church not to a dogma not to a creed but it will quicken you to the word of god only it's quickened you from this life to life eternal you who were once dead in sin and trespass has now been quickened together set in heavenly places with christ jesus feasting on manna from above seeing the hand of god made manifest prove the promise of this day are you thankful for that he says what is it the quickening power he says coming to the church making her ready he said this hour that we're approaching quickening power he says oh god help us to receive it help us to believe it see it just depends on what attitude you take whether it's going to do you any good or not he says though he says see you have to believe it you don't have to believe it he says it won't do you any bit of good and i really want to focus on that just for a moment if i could it says it just depends on which attitude you take so you know you can go to uh you can go to talk to your wife and if you have a bad attitude i can guarantee that conversation is going to go bad if you go to a co-worker with a bad attitude that conversation is going to go bad if you come to church with a bad attitude that service is not going to do you any good it may not affect the rest of us if it does you really need to calm down the attitude a little bit if it's affecting everybody else around you but it will affect how you receive the word of god if you come to church in the wrong spirit and the wrong motive or for the wrong objective you're not going to receive what god has called the minister to do which is to preach the word of god and as believers we ought to come like-minded with christ is that right how many of you know jesus was considered a radical in his day i i love it because he wasn't in the he wasn't in the church saying come to me but he was out talking to the prostitutes he was out talking to the drunkards he was out talking to the accountants the tax collectors he was out doing these things he wasn't in the church saying well you've got to come to me you've got to come do this but we see that jesus was going anywhere that he would be accepted is that right and we see that the priests the churches of that time didn't have the attitude to accept him so he went where he was accepted so if you come to the church tonight with the wrong attitude you can't be identified with that sacrifice you can't expect to get anything out of the service if you come with the wrong attitude do you believe that amen just a few more minutes here and we'll kind of bring this down to a close and he says how did samuel stood there before the people and said have i ever told you anything and this is when they were wanting a king and we see that samuel was the prophet and the people begin to come to him and say well they have a king we want a king and he says have i ever told you anything in the name of the lord but what happened he said did i ever beg for your money to live on they said no but we want a king anyhow. he said that's the way the church is today they want their i own ideas they won't pay a bit of attention to you the walk right around well it just goes to show that the quickening power is not there he says oh i say you say i spoke in tongues i jumped and shouted he said that's all fine but when that if that quicken and power is there you'll recognize like that little eagle he said that's his mom and that's the word and he says that's thus saith the lord and that's what god promised he says that's what was foretold and that's what is exactly what was happened he said we're beyond any shadow of a doubt potentially in the resurrection right now the saints getting ready to be taken up in the air i love that potentially in the resurrection right now the saints getting ready to be taken up in the air do you believe that tonight he said so jesus so full of this quickening power said if you can destroy this temple he says it took you 40 years to build he says you thought he said i'll raise it up in three days he said why could jesus say that he said i want to ask you he says why could jesus say a thing like that he says he knew what he was he said amen i wish i could make that stick he knew who he was and he knew that every word that god had ever wrote in there of him he had fulfilled it he knew he was the one that david spoke of he says do you know that you're the ones the bible speaks of their congregation said amen we got one yes so we got one on board tonight i'll take one that's more than zero so that's an accounting term i know it's technical but one is more than zero so he says do you know your position in christ he says if you're in christ you're a new creature do you know this word is just like every day living to you i love that do you know that this word is just like everyday living to you he says why sure it's yours he says you're an eagle that's your food and so we see as believers this just becomes natural to us that whenever we come up against an obstacle we just ask god to help us and what does he do he comes in and helps us he makes a way because that's just who we are we're eagles that's our food do you believe that amen do you love the lord this evening i went through and i pulled some figures in it and i just kind of estimated just based off of this website and i may be totally off because you can't believe everything that's on the internet unfortunately but um the last calculations as of a few years ago that was there an estimated total of about a hundred and billion 108 billion people have lived over the space of history throughout all time i believe there's around seven and a half billion or so on the earth right now but from the beginning of time from what they consider um the first humans on the earth there's been around 108 billion come through the earth so that's a lot right you know that that's a lot of people you look at how many people are on the earth and every time i go into you know i like living in the middle of nowhere because i'm as i said earlier i like to get in my own little bubble and work when i get around a lot of people i'm very sociable i like to talk to people but i i have i have enough when i've had enough right and some people are that way some people just they they go to when they want to recharge they go to a group of people to recharge i go away from people to recharge so and there's opposites there's not a bad it's not bad that i do that and it's not bad that people go to people and do that but there's a lot of people that has come through the earth but there's only one that come by a virgin birth is that right there's only one out of 107 billion that ever rose from the dead and ascended on high there's only one and if that same spirit that dwelt in him that raised him from the dead dwells in you it will raise and quicken our mortal bodies is that right romans 8 11 again by his spirit that dwelleth in you that's the only way our mortal bodies will be quicken is by his spirit it's not our spirit it's not brother ben's spirit it's not the song leader spirit it's by the spirit of jesus christ living on the inside of you and i we have everything that we need to take a rapture inside of us do you believe that everything that we need to take a rapture if you're filled with the holy ghost everything that you need to make that rapture is already in you but we're waiting to that appointed time is that right amen we've got to get closer to god just like enoch one day we will be and then the next day we'll be a little higher is that right no brother branham says in the easter seal and i'll just bring this to a close just in a few minutes i've said that a lot but about five more minutes and i promise it's gonna happen the easter seal in 65 remember there's only one hope he said get this quickening power and it'll hold you when everything else says give away it'll hold you he says some of them said did you keep your religion brother branham he said no it kept me he said it keeps me he says no i didn't keep it any whether i hold on or not it's whether he held on or not he is what held on for me and amen don't you believe that when you don't have enough strength to hang on he hangs on to you is that right he didn't have to angels was said and every tree said just pull your finger loose just point you don't have to take it from this cross just point your finger and watch what he said see that mocking bunch but if he had did that i couldn't have this testimony today you couldn't have the testimony today he said but because he stayed to the cross he held there and that's why i hold to him because he holds to me do you love the lord this evening and so remember adam had a conditional covenant do not eat samson had a conditional covenant do not cut your hair and you'll have this strength and and this but abraham what did he give an unconditional covenant is that right and i love how brother josh he kind of dealt on it that's what i was going to speak on tonight was was the same promise but the same promise that unconditional covenant was given to abraham that we would he would possess wherever his foot went he would possess that that was given to you and i as well is that right because we are the spiritual seed of abraham so the same spirit that made christ overcome is the same spirit on you and i that's overcoming in laodicea do you believe that amen do you love the lord this evening amen if the musicians would go ahead and come we'll go ahead and just just kind of close this down and god's provided place of worship and i think it's very important to figure out how to be identified with your sacrifice because it's to be identified with christ you can't be identified with your own will or your you can't be identified with your church you can't go up and say well you know i'm with word of life tabernacle and and i'm identified in that no you've got to be identified in jesus christ is that right he said now in 65 he said god's provided place of worship he says now we find out this old fellow being a prophet he had cursed that thing and everything stayed perfectly with the will of god and when all the rest of the preachers weakened off he stayed right there with him and one day he got so tired god sent a chariot down from heaven horses of fire and took him up he was so full of the quickening power he says just think with the word of god in his heart he becomes so full of that quickening power that it quickened him he said if the spirit of god he said i believe we find in romans 11 or 1 or he says it says if the spirit if the spirit that raised jesus from the dead be in you it will also quicken your mortal bodies and if the spirit that raised jesus from the dead if it be in you it will also quicken your mortal bodies has quickened it he said what does the word quick mean he said the word the greek word means to be brought to life after death he says hallelujah he says there's the gate of worship worshiping in the spirit and in truth mechanics and dynamics together you know there's a lot of churches that out there that can just have amazing worship services and you can even you know i've went to some denominational churches and you can get in the spirit of worship you can feel it whenever they start to sing and they've got just musicians that are amazing and they've got the lights dim and they just got the atmosphere and you can get in that spirit of worship but it doesn't do no good if you don't have the mechanics and the dynamics to put it together you've got to be worshiping in that right spirit he says you see what i mean if the spirit that raised jesus from the dead dwells in you it will quicken make alive your mortal bodies because it's already life he says and when it comes into your body it brings your whole body subject to it he says subject to what the word of god he says if it's in me so we see that that spirit of god is not going to bring a subject to a man it's not gonna be bring a subject to an idea or a dogma or a theme but it's gonna be bring a subject to the word of god so if you have any spirit that's not bringing you subject to the word of god you know it's the wrong spirit because the spirit of christ will always reflect in our life as christ was in his day is that right now we know that it's a different time it's a different age different things are happening but he was tempted just like you and i everything that we go through he has been tempted in the same manner and we see that life of christ if it overcome then it will overcome now do you believe that amen and i'll just read this last quote here thank you man's filter in 1965 he says i go to this church if you just want to play something softly says they don't never name it that thing they don't say nothing about this nothing about that none of these things are brought up our preacher is more wide-minded than that we don't say things like that or what is it he says you've got the taste of the world and you're sucking for it just right he says but a thinking woman won't take that kind of thing she knows she's got to be holy and the only thing that you can draw through god's word is the spirit the quickening power to make the word itself which is in you live to manifest jesus christ in the age you're living i want to read that again the quickening power to make the word itself which is in you live to manifest jesus christ in the age you're living so that spirit will manifest the life of jesus christ through you in laodicea says hallelujah brother he says if that ain't the truth i don't know what the truth is he said i've lost my mind if that isn't the truth is the word itself in your heart predestinated there that's drawing and it spits out that world and it don't want it but when it gets over here in the word it begins to draw and when it draws through the word it can be nothing else but the holy ghost to quicken that word so we see that if we want the life of jesus christ to live in this day we've got to have the same spirit that raised him from the dead in you and i in this day do you believe that amen why don't we just bow our heads just for a few moments as we pray to close out the service lord we just thank you for coming and speaking to us tonight lord just maybe just a little sunday school lesson god it's just what you laid on my heart but i believe as believers we can or maybe there's somebody here tonight that you know that's only gone so far that they can say well i've done this and i've done that and i've done this and i've done that but for some reason the life of christ is just not manifesting in my life like i want it to so maybe tonight they'll come to the realization that maybe they don't have what they've always said they had because in this day we don't want to point out lord that's not our goal or ambition to point out faults and say well this one doesn't have it or this one doesn't have it but we want to have the heart that christ had to say that if anyone doesn't have it we want them to get it but as believers in this day it should be our desire to see more souls saved lord it should be the desire to see people fall away or this one disbelieve but lord we should be desiring daily to see more come to you as we should live our lives as examples that when people see us they should see christ god i pray for the believers here tonight lord they they made a special effort just to come out and hear from you but i pray that the word would not return unto you void but it would go out it would accomplish that what you sent it to do i pray you just bless us tonight lord for the service coming up sunday i pray just anoint our brother stewart lord just move upon him let me just come speak great and mighty things to us lord that what we'd have need of you would bring it to us we just pray to continue for our pastor give him rest grant him peace and come back just be able to stand the line of duty again god we ask these things in jesus name [Music] amen [Music] i am [Music] jesus has changed my whole life if anybody asks you just who i [Music] once again [Music] jesus has changed my whole life if anybody asks you just who sure what key i'm going through we'll start with the first verse on that sister joanna sing the song before we go lord i have started to walk in the light shining upon me from heaven so bright i made this world and his family's a dew i started jesus and i'm going through guess i'm going through yes i'm going through and i'll pay the price whatever [Music] oh there are many who start in the race but with the light refused to keep pace others accepted because it is new but not very many expect to go through [Music] i've and started third verse oh i'd rather walk with jesus alone and have for a pillow like jacob a stone [Music] amen you love the lord this evening amen i know it was very simple and very sunday school in nature but i pray it's something that would bless your heart and and just encourage you along the journey i mean appreciate brother stewart coming in and and leading us in the song service i don't think my voice could have could have made it because i'm about out now but we just thank the lord for what he's done for us amen you'll just sing that last verse and you're free to go in the name of the lord just remember the service coming up sunday i mean i believe we'll have one service like normal so just be remembering that be praying for the service be expected and see if god can come and meet your need amen unless you see this last verse you're free to go oh brother now will you take up the cross give up this world and count it as draws and give to the poor then go through with jesus and those who adore yes i'm [Music] you
