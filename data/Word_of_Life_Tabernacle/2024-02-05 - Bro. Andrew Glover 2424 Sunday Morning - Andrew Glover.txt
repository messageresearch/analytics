that you have taught us that the angels of God would come into the building but Lord the music would drive out the evil spirits that the Angels could be sent to minister to The Heirs of Salvation and

been a hadn't it been a good weekend Amen in the presence of the the Lord amen amen I see brother Carlton back there God bless you buddy it's good to see you amen John 16 and verse number 33 uh the Bible here says these things have I spoken unto you that in me you might have peace now in the world ye shall have tribulation now I love hear how he's separating this he's separating himself from the world and he's saying in the world ye shall have tribulation but be of good cheer Now isn't that something to say right after you he you're going to have a lot of tribulation but be of good cheer for I have overcome the world that's right now these things have I spoken unto you now watch he's positionally placing you that in Me In Christ you might have peace now in the world you shall have tribulation but be of good cheer let's say this together for I have overcome the world not I will or I might but I have overcome the world now in the Book of Revelation the third chapter The Book of Revelation the third chapter and then the 21st verse of Revelation 3 amen I want to pick this up here from the uh Le oysan Church age which we know that's the age that we're living in uh Revelation 3 and verse 21 Jesus here speaking he says to him that over overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne even as I also overcame and them sat down with my father in his throne now brother BR said that's not to the church that's to the individual in the 22nd verse he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit is saying unto the churches now I love how brother B said that he that has an ear he said that's the individual not the whole group the individual that's the bride coming out you see the church so he the bride that has an ear the individual let him hear what the spirit is saying unto the churches amen we ask the Lord this morning to add the blessing to the reading of his word as you can have your seats here this morning amen we we thank the Lord for the reading of the word of God Amen I want to by the help of the Lord for just a few moments this morning if I could title this today I want to talk to you for a few moments on the ele Ed Overcomers of this age amen the elected Overcomers of this age brother Brandon preaching a message called faith in Prince Alberta es skatan 1956 he said now here I am standing just yielding myself and The Holy Spirits moving and this is what you call Heavenly places in Christ Jesus I I believe we've experienced that here this weekend amen Heavenly places in Christ Jesus he said but remember that Satan is always skeptic at the sons of God Amen Satan is always skeptic at the sons of God you know he always does that someone with a skeptic idea he said and when they do that he's just trying to interfere amen but this is where I want to draw my thought from but Christians always overcome amen Christians always overcome again how can I overcome brother B said remember amen that Christ has spoke of an elected people amen for for the last day amen not brother brandham spoke of them or Paul or anybody else but Christ himself has spoke of an elected people for the last day again how can I overcome paragraph 51 he said now we see the hours that we're in in this stage and we see what it is and the Holy Ghost is rebuking the AIDS that put him out but in all that did you notice still he said amen to him that overcometh now even in this worldly Wicked Church age amen he that overcometh now here's a prophet amen saying that leot ofan is a worldly age it's a wicked Church age amen but there's going to be some Overcomers amen that are going to come out of that age now he said we find here that God has always had Overcomers amen he's had Overcomers in every age there's always every time in every age there's been on the earth God has always had somebody he can put his hand on as a witness in the earth he's never been without a witness amen though sometimes it came down to just one amen but somebody overcame amen like the Saints of old amen now if there was Overcomers in the Old Testament amen there will be Overcomers in the New Testament if there were Overcomers in the first church age amen there will be Overcomers in the last Church age I I love the prayers of a prophet do you ever just sit down and listen to a tape amen and here brother brandom pray do you realize sometimes brother brand said more in a prayer on Amen than some preachers in that day said two hours amen amen and in this prayer he said I pray father that you'll let every one of us be Overcomers tonight amen I pray father you'll let every one of us be Overcomers tonight amen Overcomers of unbelief Overcomers of anything within ourself that we might overcome ourselves amen that Christ might live in us amen now I'll say it to you like this sometimes amen the greatest thing you're going to overcome is yourself you're going to overcome your ideas you're going to overcome your insecurities you got to overcome the way you think things ought to be amen you got to overcome the way somebody thought about you said about you looked at you Amen in order to be an overcomer amen you've got to overcome yourself in order that Christ who is already overcome amen might dwell in you and overcome through you now amen I love numbers 13:30 amen because it speaking of my type amen Joshua was a type of the end time leader amen but Caleb was a type of the people who followed Joshua and numbers 13:30 the Bible said that Caleb stealed the people before Moses and he said let us go up at once amen and possess it amen for we might be able to overcome it amen there's a possibility amen we can overcome it amen know the Bible said for we are well able to overcome it amen I say this morning let Caleb's profession amen become our profession amen that we are well able to overcome it it's not a possibility amen it's not a chance it's not well we might get good enough to overcome we might get saved enough to overcome amen the word has spoken over your life amen that you are well able to overcome it amen when you look at this word overcome it means to Prevail it means to overcome it means to endure amen it means to have power to be able to gain or to accomplish Amen to be able to reach to Prevail over to against Amen to overcome amen now watch to be the Victor to have ability to have strength amen do you realize that Caleb amen was an 80y old man amen and a lot of people look at Caleb and they don't think that Caleb overcome until he took the mountain amen but do you realize all the years that Caleb was enduring amen he was overcoming all the years that Caleb never backed off of the promise amen that God has given me an inheritance he has give me an Mountain amen he was overcoming in his enduring listen church right here this morning amen some of y'all been serving God for 20 years and 30 years and 40 years and 50 years and the devil has tried to convince you amen that you're not an overcomer amen but can I say this after everything you've been through after everything you've seen after everything you've heard amen you're still believing that God has G you an inheritance in the Rapture and you are enduring every day and you are overcoming because his strength has become your strength amen his ability has become your ability amen his anointing has become your anointing and little by little by little you're overcoming and possessing the land amen I love what the Bible says in 1 John 2:13 amen he said I write unto you fathers amen because you have known him amen that is from the beginning amen somebody say the beginning he have known him that is from the beginning now watch what John says he says I Rite unto you young men amen because you have overcome amen the wicked one amen I ride unto you little children because you have known the father what I love about this brother Joel is he's not putting this in the future he's not putting this that someday you're going to meet the father and overcome someday amen you're going to have strength to overcome but he's saying the same thing amen that Jesus said in John 16 he said I have overcome and here John saying Amen to the ones I'm writing to amen you're not going to overcome you have already overcome then what you're doing is you are enduring as a good soldier amen and you're overcoming in the greatest battle that has ever been fought in verse 14 he said I have written unto you fathers because you have known him that is from the beginning I have written unto you young men amen because you are strong amen can I preach to you young men amen you are strong amen and here's where you're strength is coming from amen the word of God abideth in you and you have overcome the wicked one so the word that's abiding in you is anointing you to overcome the wicked one in the age you're living in I'll tell you what a prophet said he said faith is a conqueror he said faith is an overcomer it isn't just a peacemaker it overcomes amen faith is the victory that overcomes the world he said what does it do what is Faith what is the Conqueror he said to conquer and victory is the same he said to conquer it means to beat down to override to handcuff and to throw into prison amen when you conquer something you beat it down you override it you handcuff it and you throw it into prison amen overcome means the sin that once ruled you amen you now rule it it means that you have overcome it you have whipped it and you are greater than it is oh Church of the Living God I think it's time to rise up amen as the Sons and Daughters of God I think it's time to beat the devil down I think it's time to override the devil I think it's time to handcuff the devil and I think it's time to put that devil in the prison amen that he put you in now you all know I'm telling the truth sometime or another you got to realize that you're greater than sin sometime or another you got to realize amen that you're greater than leosia sometime or another you got to realize amen that you are greater than the besetting sins you are greater than the habits you are greater than the Antichrist you are greater than the wickedness come on Church sometime or another you got to rise up and recognize Who You Are by the authority of the word of God that has come in this age and recognize the devil and overcome that devil I'll just tell you what the prophet said he said more people's worried about what you over or or or what to overcome he said now watch what are we to overcome that is the normal question here but what is the actual fault of the verse in Revelation three it is not so much what we are to overcome amen but how we are to overcome amen can we can we change those two words amen not so much what but how because what happens is we get so focused on what that we miss how to overcome what we're trying to overcome he said see now this is is The Logical for it doesn't matter what we are to overcome as long as we know how we can overcome in other words once you get it figured out of how to overcome something it don't matter what it is if you know how to overcome it you can overcome it anywhere anytime any place under any condition and Church of the Living God we have been well equipped by the message of the hour to overcome the devil anywhere any place anytime under any condition amen I say like a prophet said how can I overcome he said I chose this because I think it's a time that we should never let the spirit of Revival die amen we've got to keep in Revival amen constantly revived every day for Paul said I died daily that Christ amen could live amen and we must never let the spirit of Revival die within us another place said I begin to think of this text amen and overcome means to keep life in you when the life went out he said that's what brought the log in that condition now you all are familiar with that tape how I can overcome he talked about going down there and there was a log and he said brother Bill he said he stepped on that log he said when I stepped on it fell apart he said what happened was amen the log had fallen and it was in the water and he said there was no life in there he said so when I stepped on it it was in a Doty condition and it couldn't hold nothing amen I'm preaching to you amen cuz y'all know what it's like to get stepped on you know what it's like for people to step on you a and you all remember when people could step on you and it didn't keep you out of the house of God you remember when people could talk about you and it didn't quien your praise down you remember when they could spread lies on you and gossip about you and you still raised your hands you know why because in your soul you was in a Revival and the Revival was coming from the word and there was a spirit of Revival that was abiding with the word oh Church of the Living God I think it's time to get our Revival back I think it's time to get our Revival back on Monday it's time to get our Revival back on Tuesday we ain't just in Revival once a year we are in a word Revival and this revival is a fire of the word of God and the Dynamics of the Holy Ghost and it burns on good days it burns on bad days it burns on the mountain it burns in the valley it burns when we're sick it burns when we're well it burns when we're depressed feel good this morning I'm talking about a Revival that has come from the word now Overcomers here keep life in you are you with me if you're going to overcome you've got to keep life in you let me say this in Ro in Revelation three the Bible said to him that overcometh now brother BR says did you notice the arrangements of that see sat with me in my Throne not on my throne in my Throne that's in his domain see and now as Christ is the ruler the throne ruler at this time of the complete domain of God so will the church be with him the bride with him in his throne in the entire domain see not on my throne but in my Throne see where his domain reaches and a throne is over a domain and a domain reaches as far as its boundaries does and this is from eternity to Eternity now come on Church we're not talking about a temporary domain we're not talking about a temporary uh a throne position we're talking about brother Danny a domain that reaches from eternity unto eternity let me ask you this what did John say he said he that was in the beginning amen he said now right unto you children that you are strong amen because the word that was in the beginning is the same word that is restored in the end time and by the restoration of that word come a strengthen the church to withstand the greatest AG of deception listen church we are not going to be deceived I know Billy Graham said said the church is deceived but thank God for a prophet who corrected the error and said this bride can never be deceived because she's a part of God and to deceive this bride is to deceive God now I'm talking to you because you are a part of a Dominion the Bible said Romans 6:14 that sin shall not have dominion over you for ye are not under the law but you're under Grace I love what the prophet said he said our is the dominion over sin and it is enforced through the power that is in the spirit of Christ that indwells us every Kingdom on Earth is going to be Tor down but ours will remain now can I say this you are not just church members amen amen Amen brother brother brother Justin you got up this morning got ready for church amen you didn't go in the mirror and say come here Stephanie here's a king amen you're looking at a priest amen now come come on you know why amen because the way we see ourselves we don't see ourselves as kings we don't see ourselves as priests but if we could overcome ourselves then we could see ourselves the way the word sees us and the word said we have been made Kings and preached unto God now I know what the devil's done the devil has made that in the future but my Bible said that hath made us Kings and Priests unto God and his father to him be glory and Dominion forever and ever amen can I say this you are a king in the present you will also be a king in the future according to the prophet he said he hath made us that's a certain truth we need to emphasize is he hath made us salvation is of his doing salvation is of the lord it's all of Grace he redeemed us for a purpose he bought us for a purpose we are Kings and spiritual Kings now can I preach to you we are going to be Kings upon the Earth with him when he sits on his throne amen but now we are spiritual Kings and we Reign Over a spiritual Kingdom now come on the devil says that's in the future amen but here a prophet is saying it's not just in the future but there's some spiritual kings in the present that are reigning over a spiritual Kingdom according to Romans 5:17 by one man's offense amen death reigned by one man which by by one man much more they which receive amen an abundance of Grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in his life by one Jesus Christ but watch Colossians 1:13 who hath delivered us from the power of darkness and have translated us into the kingdom which that word kingdom is a reign of his dear son oh brother sister right now we reign with Christ amen if you could if you could break beyond your feelings right now you would see that right now you reign with Christ all right having dominion over sin over the world over the Flesh and the devil and you are showing forth his praise and glory you are showing forth himself for it is Christ in us who is willing and doing of his good pleasure yes indeed even now we are seated in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus now let me say this some of you all amen you're looking for Dominion Amen to rule over the devil to rule over the Antichrist and to rule over the Earth amen and some of you can't even rule over your flesh in a Sunday morning service right now your flesh is whipping you your flesh has got you distracted your flesh has got you upset your flesh has got you frustrated H come on somebody it's Sunday morning and we might as well preach amen but I believe there's a bride amen that has the ability by the Deliverance of the power of God Amen to bring her flesh into subjection to the word and you can praise God in your flesh right here right now regardless of what you're going through amen can I preach a second amen I think we need to break Beyond something I think we need to break Beyond dead moments and meetings I think we need to break Beyond just just a little L you well can I preach brother Ben you know what I'm talking about amen you know how you open the atmosphere is you back the word of God you know how you open the Supernatural is you back the word of God you know how you open a man's gift is you back the word of God and when you begin to back the word of God God begins to come into battle and he begins to fight down the devil he begins to fight back against the spirits and he begins to bring an anointing into the building and the anointing is what destroys the Yoke and I say this morning we are in dominion over the flesh by the anointing of the Son of God y'all know what I'm talking about amen sometimes you got to you you got to you got to just go ahead and tell your flesh I'm going to have church you know what I'm talking about sometimes you just got to go ahead and tell your flesh I'm going to raise my hands I'm going to go ahead and clap my hands I'm going to go ahead and stomp my feet I know what I'm talking about amen I'm going to go ahead and stand up am me whatever I got to do to let this flesh know he is not going to have dominion over me but I'm going to have dominion over him if I got to pray I'm going to pray if I got to shout I'm going to shout well and we got to be careful amen if we get to shouting too much amen somebody might get in the flesh well pray tell me how else are you going to praise God he's not going to make you an angel come on now he's not going to make you a cherubim amen but in this sorry stinking rotten flesh we have got the baptism of the Holy Ghost and we have been given an authority to bring our flesh into subjection to the word and we're going to praise God in this flesh I'm going to preach in this flesh I'm going to praise in this flesh I'm going to worship in this flesh I'm going to preach the message in this flesh I'm going to do the best thing I can do to this flesh I'm going to bring it into subjection to the word of power and authority and Lead it to a change I tell you why I'm saying these things is because you're air to more than what you think you're air to you are air to more than what you think you are air to according to a prophet he said the overcome is the heir of all things the Overcomer is the heir of all things he said you know people I don't see what's the matter with you as Christians that you don't walk around a little while amen and see what you own why don't you walk around a little while and see what you own come on now amen you got to walk around a little bit and see what you own you own more than depression as a matter of fact you don't own it you own more than nervousness as a matter of fact you don't own it you own joy and speakable and full of Glory hlj now either it's the truth or not either we're Overcomers or we're not either we're conquerors or we're not but listen Word of Life I'm persuaded of better things of you I am persuaded amen by the word of God that you are not just conquerors you are more than conquerors I am persuaded by the word of God you are more than Overcomers you are more than church members you are more than just people who is trying to overcome you are the inheritance you are the Overcomers and the Overcomers are the heir of all things can I say this to you this is the age of the Overcomer this is the age of the Overcomer prophet of God said in adoption part one he said Canaan does not represent the age of the Millennium it only represents the age of the Overcomer he said what is it it is the dispensation of overcoming because in can and they killed and they burned and they took cities but there'll be no death in the Millennium there'll be no burning down cities in the Millennium there'll be no there'll be no sickness in the Millennium now I know what many people have done they have taken these wonderful promises and they had put them so far in the future and said now if anybody's going to obtain them it's way off in the future but the prophet of God said amen we won't need Divine Healing in the Millennium he said we need Divine Healing now he said so why are we putting these things in the future when there's a people on the Earth that needs it now to possess these things can I say this amen many people are saying well you know I'm waiting till the Millennium and then I'm going to do some fighting amen can I say this there'll be no fighting in the Millennium if you're ever going to fight the devil church and living God now is the time to do it if you're ever going to fight the devil we need to fight him now come on well brother Andrew one day in the Millennium amen I'll fight for and get a breakthrough we won't need a breakthrough in the Millennium well one day brother Andrew over in the Millennium I I'll really break through this heaviness and I'll enjoy the blessings of God we won't need to break through the heaviness in the Millennium but right here right now this morning we need to break through the clouds of gloom and doom we need to break through the spirits of Oppression and depression and suppression we need to break through the clouds of down and step into the atmosphere where the Holy Ghost of God can come in the Church of God and can reveal the word of God as the authority of God in The Bride of God to overcome the enemy of God the devil Hallelujah now is the time to fight now is the time to win the battle and to overcome the things of the world there won't be no fight there the last prayer will be made there'll be no more prayer meetings there'll be no place for people to get saved there'll be no sickness to be healed it'll just be one great glorious thing see what could we as human beings this morning what could we promise what could we look at anything that would be any greater than looking to that promise of that time so the prophet of God is putting something in the future but Brother David is not the power to fight it's the Fulfillment of the promise of the word of the age you're living in now can I say this to you I believe that we're living in a special time I believe according to the message of the hour that we are living in adoption time now do you all know the Bible speaks of adoption the Bible speaks of spiritual adoption in Romans 8:14 the Bible said as many as are led by the spirit of God they are the sons of God for ye have not received amen the spirit of bondage again to fear but ye have received amen the spirit of adoption whereby we cry AB our father I love what the prophet says in God rich in Mercy I'm only saying this not to mix up Doctrine but to straighten it out that we might get away from this fear and scare you don't know who you are you're not going to be but now you are the sons of God see you always were the sons of God Amen can I can I take a five minute preach and break here and preach a second amen sometime or another you got to overcome the Battle of am I seat of God or not sometime or another you got to over come that devil because you got bigger battles to fight you got bigger cities to burn down you got bigger walls to tear down you got bigger Giants to slay sometime or another you got to come to a place of a revelation I'm a Son of God I'm a seat of God my name is in the Lamb's Book of Life amen I'm on my way to a Rapture I know who my daddy is I know where I come from and I know where I'm going I know what I'm talking about amen cuz if you don't ever settle that the devil will have you living in limbo when the things are going good you're a Son of God and when things are going bad you're not when you're well you're a Son of God and when you're sick you're not amen but if you ever come to a victory over the devil of confusion if you ever come to a place of authority then no matter what the devil says no matter what the devil throws at you you can stand up on the word of God and say I'm a Son of God I'm a daughter of God I'm a seed of God and there's nothing the devil can do to change who I [Music] amall get away from the fear and scare get away from the spirit of bondage get away from the ideas of confusion and come underneath the spirit of adoption and start walking as an overcomer now you say but Andre I don't know well can I say this your sons of God are the sons of God by the seed of God the prophet of God said now look you're already hiss by preach destination the seed has come to life and no world can get in I love that because Brother Sam you'll be in the world and you'll have tribulation in the world but be of good cheer for I have overcome the world come on so before you come in the world there was a seed of the mighty conqueror on the inside of your soul and it was more than just a lot it was more than just a feeling it was an eternal deposit of the almighty God into your soul listen then wherever you go the seed of God remains wherever you face the seed of God remains whatever the devil throws at you brother Judah in your teenage years the seed of God remains come on the seed of God remains well I feel like dancing here for a second on my good days I'm a seat of God and on my bad days I'm a seat of God when I'm on the mountain I'm a seat of God and when I'm in the Valley I'm a seat of God when I'm in a trial I'm the seat of God so it don't matter what I'm going through this seed remains Hallelujah the seat of God remains your feelings will change but the seat of God remains your emotions will change but the seat of God remains come on Mama come on Mama the devil will get a hold of them hormones and they will change but the seed of God remains hallelujah oh thank you Lord Jesus come on what I'm talking about the seed of God remains absolutely come on you're Overcomers yes sir now the prophet of God said Christ and his alone see already finished the seed was there brother Sean the seed seed was already when was it put there before the foundation of the world see watch and has predestinated us unto eternal life are y'all hearing me the seed didn't come at the altar the seed didn't come when you heard the first tape or read the first book or went to the first Youth Camp but the seed was put there from the beginning from before the foundation of the in other words that's why John could write and say young men the word of God abides which is the seat of God and in the end time when the Antichrist is revealed when the mark of the beast is revealed there will be somebody on the earth who will be fully equipped by the revelation of predestination from the forn knowledge of God that they will stand Toe to Toe with that devil and say devil you come too late I am a seed of God I have got representation in God and there is nothing there is nothing there is nothing there is nothing oh I feel like preaching there is nothing the devil can do Amen to change what God has done in eternity he saved you in eternity he redeemed you in eternity he filled you in eternity he sought you in eternity and now you are in time and the devil can't change the Eternal plan of God glory all right Glory Hallelujah I'm talking about somebody that's got some backbone all right I'm talking about somebody the devil can't make his puppet yes sir now y'all know I'm talking about the seed of God right and that seed is in the heart it's not in the head in other words this adoption is not intellectual It's Supernatural oh yeah this adoption is something that is transcending the natural am brother B said we today are God's Spiritual Church oh yeah can we say Amen we today are God's spiritual church with a spiritual law that is written on the table of our hearts so where is this seed working at it's not working in your head it's working in your heart come on now brother said why can iist speak or rather leadership he said Moses went out there I love how he says brother Joe he said Moses went out there and he looked upon the Egyptians and he looked upon the Israelites and he seen their condition and sister Vicki I love what he says he says and the seed of God went to work in his heart the predestinated seed went to work in his heart he looked at the Egyptians he looked at the Israelites he seen all the bondage but the oh God but what he was seeing with his eye could not affect what he was believing with his Hearts because there was a seed in his heart that was greater than the temporal things he could see with his eye and brother BR brings that to the church and says we today are God's spiritual church with a written law on our hearts are you ready for this and we are LED in a spiritual form brother said the leadership of God is what he said it's follow the Vindicated word of God for the age the leadership of God is to follow what's been Vindicated don't get mad at me but your feelings hadn't been Vindicated your emotions hadn't been Vindicated your Sensations hadn't been Vindicated and I'm this close to it I might as well preach and neither are we following gifts come on I said neither are we following gifts because your gift has not been Vindicated it's not the sign of the Messiah we thank God for your gift amen but you will never subject this bride Amen to an impersonation of the sign of the Messiah and call it the bride's Revival as long as this old country boy has got breath in my body I will say what a prophet said he said there's one to an age and anything outside of the Vindicated side of the Messiah is a Janice and Chambers impersonation and their fly will be made manifest amen Old Church of the Living God I think it's time to remember that God sent a prophet in this generation and he was more than just some preacher he was more than just some teacher but the pillar of [Music] fire I know what I'm talking about amen cuz you brother Ben can I take some Liberty because you put the open gifts on the floor and before long you're going to have demons leading the church instead of the Holy Ghost Brother David you know what I'm talking about amen amen open up the floor and let every gift come in and don't check it amen before long can I have some Liberty you know what happens don't you amen if somebody operates a gift and because somebody has put a fear over them of touch not my anointed amen they claim that's anointed and so nobody checks it because they don't want to be guilty of blaspheming Amen but can I ask you when did we get so chicken hearted that we can't even check things by the word of God anymore we used to check things by the message we used to give it the word test we used to say this is of God and this is not now come on Church am I tell you what happened amen is the people doing it change but the word didn't change and I don't care what their name is I don't care what their direction is if it's contrary to the headship of this body we ought to give it the word test and if it's found an error we ought to repent of the thing and move on for the glory of God I know what I'm talking about amen cuz you let guests come in and you don't check them by the word and I may get in trouble but I'm going to preach here for a second I was preaching one time and I you know how it is brother Carlton I kind of got into an area on the prophet of God teaching Church order you know and I said man I said thank God for a prophet who come and taught Church order I said he put the gifts in the back room he put the church in order I I could feel a little bit of tension you know come in the room and I looked over and the pastor man he was bullying at me you know amen and I I just you know I was just dumb I just kept on preaching I got in the back room and he come back here I never forget it took his hand he said that was for brandom Tabernacle that ain't got nothing to do with the bride today I said if it was good enough for brandom Tabernacle it's good enough for every church that claims to believe the prophet that God raised up out of brandom [Applause] Tabernacle now I know where I'm at I'm I'm I'm I'm standing right with the message because what happens is is you get people saying things by impression and not by true leadership so they say oo I feel I see you're going to have a bad day God's going to bless you you're going to marry a certain person you're going to be a part of a certain oh come on church I know what I'm talking about amen because what happens is is because it don't be checked by the word people are scared and so they live in bondage come on come on well brother so and so told me I was going to marry a specific person or brother so and so told me I was going to do a specific job amen are you hearing me amen take it to the word of God come on Word of Life take it to the word of God and if it's contrary to a message amen get mad at me if you want to but be a man and stand with the message of the hour stand with a prophet of God stand with what has been Vindicated as the Messi sign to this age come on Spiritual Church LED in a spiritual form oh yes come on come on preach come on preach ooh you've been through a lot you've been through a lot o but you're going to make it that's thus sayith the Lord no come that's vain repetition y'all want to preach or go home that's vain repetition that's right oo I see oo that's it that's good that's it what is it identify it on woo I feel good preaching the message that's what makes me shout identify it either it's God or it's a devil impersonating the Messiah side and it ought to be brought subject to the word and we ought to break the confusion over the minds of people and come back to the landmark of the church which is the message of the Hour come on young people I don't care what anybody feels over you anybody thinks over you don't you subject your life to a gift that's got a possibility to be an heir when you got a message that has been Vindicated in the heavens it's been Vindicated on the earth it's been Vindicated in the pits of hell this message will never it'll never lead you into confusion all right on well I might as well goad and hit it we're this close to it demons come in the church brother preach three parts on it demonology right oh I'm getting I gotta keep moving he preached on demonology and you know what happens I remember one time hell can I preach brother Ben remember one time I was in a meeting and the guy got up he prophesied and spoke in tongues interpreted and they prophesied well brother brother brother Danny when they got done prophesying we had three interpretations of one prophecy three interpretations of one prophecy so what we done was we took the three interpretations and hung them up on the bulletin board and brother Harvey God is my witness the pastor got up the next service he said now the Lord has spoken to this church and he said there's been a prophecy and he said now the interpretations is on the billboard he said and whichever one comes to pass that's the direction of God for this church I'm sorry I'm not a hir and I'm a message preacher so I asked the brother I said brother so we're going to stand here in limbo and wait on one of these interpretations to come to pass for direction for the church when we've got the message of the hour [Music] Hallelujah bring it back to the word the message of the hour is the direction for the church you to know about your future get in the message you want to know about your home get in the message brother I need somebody to see something over me no you need to hear what a prophet saw over you he saw you sitting at the marriage supper of the Lamb he saw you as an overcomer he saw you as a messiah he saw you as an invincible Army amen now listen will it be easy no can I have that picture the pillar of fire will it be easy no all right come on will it be easy no no but can I tell you what a prophet said he said people who follow the pillar of fire now I know what you're saying you're saying brother Andrew we we need oh God help me Lord we need to do away with this picture because it's got a man in it well I'm sorry that that's as high as your thinking's gone but see there's some of us that's got the mind of Christ and we see more than a man we see the pillar of fire that's why it's in our homes that's why it's in our churches that's why it's in our come on Church the prophet of God said that's the only supernatural being that has ever been photographed now look at that picture and hear a prophet's words he said these words he said people who follow the pillar of fire they will certainly have a rough time oh my in the world you will have tribulation but be of good cheer for I have overcome the world they will have a of time but they'll be ready for the translation at that time they'll be ready to go in other words if you follow the pillar of fire it's not going to be easy if you follow the pillar of fire it's going to be some rough days it's going to be some hard trials but you can lift up your head unto the heels from which cometh your help your help comes from God and the Bible said that the pillar of fire is a go between in the time of trouble come on church I'm going to stay with a pillar of fire I may have to struggle we may have to suffer we may have to hurt but we're going to stay with God's Vindicated leadership it'll lead us out of this mess and'll bring us back to a stability yes sir come on now oh God I'm getting sure World either it's right or it's wrong right either he was right or he was wrong come on well you're looking at one country boy that believes he was right and everybody else is wrong come on I get mad at me if you want to but my picture ain't under the pillar of [Music] fire brother Ben's picture ain't under the pillar of fire brother Donnie's picture ain't under the pillar of fire brother Tim ain't under the pillar of fire brother Ron Brother Sean brother wend brother none of these preachers are under that so you know what that tells me we're not the headship to the body the message of the hour through the lips of the seventh angel is the absolute to this generation so we submit ourselves and overcome by what he said now listen thank you brother we are the children of God Amen by promise and Grace we've come out of confusion we're not living by gifts we're not living by emotions we're not can I borrow brother Sean amen we're not vulnerable anymore we don't believe everything that comes our way come on E either brother Brandon was right or he was wrong and a prophet said oh God a prophet taught how dreams are interpreted he taught how the word is interpreted he said if there's a symbol in the dream it takes a prophet to interpret it come on church amen either we believe it or not I'm going to bring it real down close and then we're going to hurry and get through this point amen either we're a message church or we're not and if we're not going to stand with the full message let's quit saying we're a message church and quick conf confusing the people either let's say what a prophet said and let's stand with it come hell or H water or let's walk off and take something else now you said brother you're getting pretty strong I am getting strong cuz it's confusion come on and the message of the hour is not confusion that's right right come on Amen come on that's good come on good the spirit is not confusion the spirit beareth record with our spirit that we are the children of God now can I say this to you can I have a few more minutes y'all still love me absolutely come on we are living in the season where the confusion has been broke and we're no longer under expectation of something to happen we're living in the season of manifestation right in other words what was an expectation a few years ago is now the manifestation on can I say this and you are that manifestation in other words we're not here every service building up your hopes there's something great coming or's something great going to happen oh just pray just fast no we're saying what has been spoken as expectation has now come to manifestation because we've come back under the headship of the body which has the ability to transform the expectation to manifestation in other words I I sat like this I was preaching down at Matt brother mats on Wednesday amen and while I was preaching I got in this area and brother it just it just struck me as clear as day that I'm literally preaching to manifestations because I remember a few years ago amen when brother Matt felt his heart to start the work there I went there and preached when it was a barn and I remember walking by bulletin board and talk about bulletin board I walked by a bulletin board and there was a bunch of names on there and brother Matt said those are babies that are that we're praying for for God to bring them back in the house of God and brother Samu while I was preaching Wednesday night it was his clear as day it broke before me that what I seen over there in on bulletin board is sitting before me in manifestation the ones they were praying for had moved from expectation into manifestation in other words we expected but now the manifestation is here they're back in the house of God well come on Word of Life amen some of you all amen years ago was expectations you and your family was expectation your confession amen but this morning you're not expectation you are here in manifestation sir don't get mad at me brother Caron years ago the bride was an expectation but today I can say by the voice of the seventh angel she is now in manifestation she has been revealed this is the days of the manifestation of the sons of God in the days of the manifestation of the sons of God when the Mysteries that has been hid since the foundation of the world is to be made known this is the hour now that's why I say we're not going back to preaching gifts we're going to preach the reveal amen Mysteries of the word of God in the age we're living in I believe in the gifts I believe in Emotion I believe in shouting come on y'all been hearing me preach since I was a teenager you know I believe in those things but I believe where the power comes to whip the devil is by the preaching of the revelation of the word of God in the age that's been unveiled in and let that take the preeminence in the church now can I just go ahead and preach a minute I'm feeling good right now brother Bill Propet of God said this is the day when the sons of God are manifested he said do you know that men are sons of God they are amateur Gods remember my opening quote whenever the spirit of God moves the devil is skeptic of the sons of God but Christians always overcome he said the Bible said ye are gods in Genesis 2 they were Gods because they had full dominion over the Dominion of the world he give him dominion over all things amen but he lost his godship he lost his sunship he lost his domain and Satan took it over when Adam fell he lost his sunship he lost his godship ship he lost his domain and the devil took it over but brother Oh Glory but brother we are waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God who will come back and will take it over [Applause] again all right testing one two we are waiting for the manifestations of the sons of God who will come back and take it over again listen we are not taking something away from the Devil that belong to him he took it away from us I said he took it away from us so you feel bad to go take something back from the Devil he's a squatter he's a thief he's a robber it don't belong to him come on Mama I know the devil's got that baby but it belonged to you before it belonged to him I know the devil's got your Revival but it belonged to you before it belonged to him so rise up as a manifest Son of God and go to the enemy's camp and say devil I'm taking back my babies I'm taking back my joy I'm taking back my Revelation I'm taking back my peace I'm taking back my praise I'm taking back my shout I'm taking back my dance I'm taking it [Music] [Applause] back hall it's time to take it back I said it's time to take it back it don't belong to the devil it don't belong to the devil it belongs to you take it back now I know what the devil says he says well y'all getting too far out there with that shouting religion has it ever dawned on you now I'm I'm just going to preach here for a second cuz we've got one service come on we can settle a lot of confusion come on brother Andrew I I don't know we sing We Sing new songs we don't sing them old songs well I I just I'll just say this I've been in meetings before and Brother David we've sung songs that Luther didn't even know you've been there we we we sung songs that Luther didn't even sing and there wasn't an ounce more of anointing come in the building than if we' have been singing our god is awesome that's right right there' have probably been more CU we would have known it actually so confusion comes in and then we get praise police oh God and so they say will you watch when they sing a certain song Everybody shouts at that certain song can I preach well has it ever crossed your mind that they might have a reality of that [Music] [Applause] song has the thought ever crossed your mind that they might know that their God is is awesome Hallelujah has it ever crossed your mind that they might have been in the fiery furnace but they seen the awesome God come in the fiery furnace and deliver them has it ever crossed your mind that their God is a high God and he's a holy God you say brother Ander oh God I'm going preach a bus he say well I'm a little bit sick of all this singing hey hey you don't know like I know what God has done for me and everybody shouts well maybe he ain't done nothing for you so you ain't got nothing to shout about but when we at Judah I know where he brought me from I know what he saved me from I know what he done for me I know the hell that he brought me out of so I got a reason to dance because I'm taken back what the devil stole from me y'all know I'm telling the truth so then oh God I'm going to get in trouble sure where so then you get you get spiritual protest you know we don't like that song and so we want the whole church to know we don't like that song Come On so rather than just moving on can I preach brother Ben I sit one time there some guys talking about some songs and they said one song and I said yeah I really don't like that song they said you don't like that song I said well to be honest with you I really don't care for it they said seriously I said yeah they said we had never known that I said I know you wouldn't have because I don't hold a silent protest when you sing it that's right that's right I'm not an infant baby I'm a mature Son of God and I know that when we get done singing this we're going to sing another song so I'm not going to sit on the atmosphere and let everybody around me know I don't like this song I'm going to go ahead and sing it cuz I know there's another song coming well glory to God it feels good in the house of God on Sunday morning it's time to grow up and quit putting a quit putting a kink in the atmosphere here and let the Holy Ghost move something that song might bless you it may I don't know why I'm here but I'm here it may not bless me and what blesses me may not bless you but guess what in a few minutes the Holy Ghost is going to come in the building and he's going to bless us all so if he comes by How Great Thou Art or our god is awesome or I would not be denied or There Is Power in the Blood amen let's just lay aside our feelings and overcome ourselves and let the Holy Ghost come in the church in the power power of [Applause] authority because when he shows up he's going to bless us all Oh Brother Bruce when he shows up he's going to bless the old he's going to bless the young he's going to bless the babies he's going to bless the teenagers he's going to bless the preacher he's going to bless the musicians I say let's overcome ourselves now you say brother Andrew you're getting way out there am I though oh come on we got to overcome ourselves yes sir I hate to bust your bubble on Sunday morning oh my but it ain't all about us that's right it ain't about us that's right now you said brother anderw I wish the Holy Ghost was here he is yes the presence of the Holy spirit in this world he said instead of Jesus being here proves that Jesus was righteous and went to the father that's right he said he sent the comforter he was the comforter he came back in spirit upon the true church he is the faithful and true witness in the midst of the church now I know what people do right here they say well brother Andrew you're preaching about a Dominion so you're saying Corporal body so he's not here in any power let me say this I believe in the Corporal body of Jesus Christ that's right but brother said one day he's going to come back in flesh again he said he will prove who is the only wise potentate it is he Jesus Christ the lord of Glory now can I say this to you his Corporal body return that's the future yeah that's right but brother Joel what about the present tense right here now now if a voice can I can I preach here for a second if a voice of indication comes in the church it settles the confusion I've used this many times if there was no lights in this building and you walked in the building and brother Harvey you walked up the aisle and you got halfway up and you tripped over something and you kept on walking you went back out tripped over it again and you met brother Jeremy out in the in the forer and you said he said brother Harvey why' you trip over and you say well I think somebody got their chair out in the aisle too far so brother Jeremy walks down through here and he trips over and he said no that that that that feels different than a chair so he goes back out and brother Danny's walking in and he said brother Danny he said I tripped over something he said but then he said what do you think it is he said I'll just be honest with you we had that Bigfoot preacher from Tennessee or Virginia and I think one of his shoes is out there in the aisle okay so brother Danny walks in and he gets halfway up there and he he's walking through there and he said that's at Joel again he's been in here working and left a ladder in the floor so now we've got three different interpretations of one object three interpretations of one object so how are we going to settle it well somebody's got to turn on the light and when the light comes on the light is not going to change what is laying there it's going to reveal what is laying there and when the light strikes it it's going to reveal that somebody dropped a toy and the toys laying there so we had a shoe we had a ladder we had a chair but when the lot spoke the lot said it's a toy come on church we had this Bible for 2,000 years and people were tripping over this and tripping over that and somebody said what was it they said well it's three gods and somebody said what was it they said well there's no hell amen but then in the days of the son of man in the evening time it shall be light again when the light comes on it will reveal what is laying there and here's what a prophet said my Ministry is to declare him that he is here what's all these signs about he's here what's all this healing about he's here what's all this Revelation about he's here what's all this crying about he's here what's all these charts about he's here are you hearing me the Son of God is here now I'm going to say this to you if he's here he's got to be somewhere on the lamb was one creature the dove was another creature but when the Dove and the lamb United together God was manifested in the flesh that's right all right but now are you ready for this but now he's manifested in your flesh right thank you Lord that's right that's good in your flesh by being adopted Sons oh yes so adoption brings light on your sunship and shows through the baptism of the Holy Ghost you are joined hirs with the Lord Jesus Christ and the super oh God I'm running out of time the Super was the first man that God could come into all that God was he poured into Christ and all that Christ was he poured into the church super sign God and man together was to be the Super sign of the last day I haven't left my subject now the Overcomers of this page are you ready for this when the entire Bible was to be fulfilled in the last day when the entire Bible was to be fulfilled in the last days would be when the sons of God would be revealed or manifested and the power of God would return to the church the authority of God would return to the church and the word of God would be restored to the church then we would step into adoption I'm closing on this point the prophet of God said look he said we were predestinated unto the adoption let me back up here and pull one verse from Galatians 4:3 even so when we were children we were in bondage under under the elements of the world but when the fullness of the time was come God sent forth his son made of a woman made under the law to redeem them that were under the law that we might receive the adoption of sons now can I say say what a prophet said your adoption is not your birth it's your placing that's right period is that okay what a prophet talk see now I'm going to close on this point right here so why would you say election can I say this to you because your election goes with your adoption that's right amen come on ready for this which positionally places you in your position yeah look at look at Romans 9:11 that the purpose of God according to election might stand Romans 11:28 but as touching the election they are beloved for the father's sakes 1 Thessalonians 1:4 knowing Brethren beloved your election is of God can I give you second Peter 1:10 wherefore the rather Brethren give diligence to make sure to make your calling and election what sure for if you do these things then one day you might fall but you might make it come on if you do these things Brother David ye shall never fall can I can I give you the Bible definition of election it is used of the act of God's Free Will by which before the foundation of the world he decreed His blessings to certain persons say it louder I'm one of them brother amen hallelujah the decree was made from choice by which he determined to bless certain persons through Christ by Grace oh yeah a thing or person that's chosen so in other words Brother David don't get mad at me but you weren't born and he look at you and say I can't use David uh maybe use Sean but I can use Ben and I don't know about Joel but I can sure use Miguel and maybe Judah eventually I don't know he did this before you was born yeah come on before you come in the world John wrote about you and said you'll be strong and you'll overcome the world Listen Church John was writing to the Overcomers of the last age you know why because they wouldn't just be overcoming one deed they would be overcoming the culmination of every rebuke of seven Church ages but the prophet of God said they would overcome come on by the word now look at this how many believes in predestin for ordination election if you believe the Bible you have to predestination looks back to for knowledge but for knowledge brother Allan looks to destination he said but God not making set it in order a little hole that you have to go through and can't go no other way but God in order to be God he know the end from the beginning so he could predicted and set things in order to happen now I'm going to talk to you about Moses here he said Look by God's wise Providence he revealed by spiritual Revelation that this was going to be his chosen vessel the prophet of God said so Moses mother wasn't scared of the king's Commandments for by faith she saw him with the children of Israel amen now what did she do she saw him placing them over in the promised land the prophet of God said God know everything would be placed can you give me first Peter 1:1 the Bible says Peter an apostle of Jesus Christ verse two elect according to the forn knowledge of God the Father through sanctification of the spirit unto obedience and the sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ Grace unto you and peace be multiplied look at this word forn knowledge it is the forethought amen it is a pre-arrangement so in other words when you showed up God did not make arrangements for you the arrangements was already made come on God calls Men by election by the four knowledge the prophet of God s God in order to be God no in the end from the beginning he had to know everything he had to know what the end was from the beginning or he wouldn't have been the almighty God can I say this to you amen we sing a song Amen of the goodness of God how many knows that song Amen Luther didn't sing it we sing it of the goodness of God are you hearing me can I say this to you amen the goodness of God is manifest Ed in the forn knowledge of God the goodness of God is manifested in the forn knowledge of God in other words the prophet said now in the calling of this time they're going out on this I was born of a very humble parent a very humble home I have no education at all when I made that remark a while ago about education I wasn't trying to take crutches from my ignorance but what I'm trying to say is that it doesn't take education to know God it takes a submissive heart to know God and I was raised poor I was raised in an irreligious family but from the very time I was born amen something happened it was not of my goodness not of my parents' goodness but by the for knowledge of God oh y'all get mad at me if you want to but brother Justin I guarantee it brother Brandon was here amen and made this statement and we sang that song you don't know like I know I guarantee you he' shout right with us he said he brought it I don't know why I don't know why he brought me he said but I get to show that he can choose what he wish to whether it come out of the Vatican City or off of a rubbish heap if God chooses to use your vessel in the last days there is nothing the devil can do to defeat the forn knowledge of God that's right are you ready for this I'm closing on this point right here you're going to fight to go to hell or you're going to fight to go to heaven you have been forn of God you have been predestinated of God you have been called of God you've been elected of God that you say brother and I don't want to fight well if you don't want to fight to go to heaven you're going to fight to go to hell if you don't want to fight to go to hell you have to fight to go to heaven either way you go you're going to have to fight to get there so I think as long as I've got the message of the hour and I know who called me and I know who elected me and I know who fornew me before my mama before my daddy before any sin I ever committed I'm going to pick up my sword as an elected Overcomer of this last day and brother Harold I'm going to fight my way to heaven I'm going to fight Beyond fear I'm going to fight Beyond false Doctrine I'm going to fight Beyond confusion I'm going to fight Beyond besetting sin I'm going to fight beyond the devil I'm going to fight beyond the Antichrist I'm going to fight Beyond The Mark I'm going to fight Beyond denomination I'm going to fight Beyond confusion come on Gentile Warriors it's time to rise up and draw your sword as the Overcomers of this age and fight back against that devil on Sir time to fight back Church on yes sir yes sir I said it's time to fight yeah that's right let our musicians come this morning it's time to fight it's time to fight the devil we fought one another long enough come on we p quote against quote long enough there you are there you are we put the message in the Bible in the arena long enough yeah yeah whichever one overcomes and comes out wins come on have you really got to the place that we oh God come on have we really got to the place we're going to let the devil de weaponize I just made a word brother Bill the weaponizers come on now brother Sean you know how the devil disarms the church he comes in brother Bill and he gets you to look at your he gets you to look at your armor that's right brother David he gets you to take your weapon and look at it in put it in your hand and look at it and say I don't know if it'll work that's true and brother said the minute the devil gets you to question your weapon is the second he's disarmed you that's right amen the second you take this message in your hand and say I don't know if brother Bram was right about that or not is the second the devil has just disarmed you all right come on come on I'm just preaching a little bit this morning minute he get you to look at your get your weapon in your hand and say you know what brother BR talked that church order stuff but you know man I just have to be honest with you I I this you know I just don't uh I just don't think that that's oh brother BR was a prophet yeah he was a prophet of God oh my well we might as well preach we're this close to it yeah come on well you know brother Ender I brother B taught that about them boys wearing them shorts you know but oh come on come on buddy get it and I know he Tau about that makeup on faces and fingernail paint on fingers and nail paint nail polish and I know we talk about them televisions but you realize come on he was talking to he was talking to worldly people come on we're in the message come on now well if you're wearing what a prophet identified as worly you're not in the message you're in the world Amen and you're headed for tribulation that's right amen but you know what I say it's time to do it's time to disarm the devil it's time to get back in the books time to get back in the tapes it's time to get out of every YouTube channel and every this that time to get back in the message and disarm the devil it's time to get back in the quotes preachers I said it's time to get back in the quotes and get back in the pullit and disarm the devil and say you've gone as far as you're going to go as for me in this church we believe the message as for me in this home we believe the message as for me and my family we're going to serve the word come on yes sir are you going to Overcomer how many Overcomers have I got here today I didn't get to it but I'm going say this some days you're going to overcome by pressing can I can I can I leave this with you some days you're going to overcome by pressing other days you're going to overcome by surrendering oh my some days sis you're going to have to reach down real deep and you're going to have to press against the mud you're going to have to press against the muck you have to press against the M because you're a Pond Lily and if you're going to overcome you got to press to overcome right some days you're the baby trying to put the coat on and you think you got it all figured out and your arms just going every which way and and then brother Danny a steady hand comes and gets a hold of your hand and leads your hand over to the coat hole and guide your hand in it and you put it on and wear it you know what you didn't do you didn't press your way in the coat you pressed your way out of the world but you surrendered into [Music] Christ let us stand our feet this morning what he samander I'm saying as Overcomers it's time to overcome amen that's good some days you're going to have to press now I can bring this right in the

mad at me but a busy day is not an excuse to miss church I know things happen sometimes we can't make it but sometimes you got to press be on had a brother tell me other day sper he said I come to church on Wednesday he said I was tore up he said my spirit was tore up he it it really astounded me the confession of Faith he said I was so broken I was was so down I was so tore up he said but then I thought well I'm not even going to church it's Wednesday night brother Allen he said these words he said but then I looked over and seen my family and my babies and he said I thought God I can't set an example that when you have a bad day you just stay home he said so rander I came on with a bad attitude and a bad Spirit he said but I didn't want to set a example to my babies that this is how you do when you have a bad day I said brother you're an overcomer oh yeah some of youall are overcoming right here right now and the devil's telling you you can't you can't you can't you can't but I say you've already overcome oh thank you Lord now church I say this this morning brother Andrew what who you after who you trying to correct I'm after the devil I'm after the devil I'm after the spirit of the enemy is trying to disarm the bride and get her to question this message because if you question in one area you'll question in another and another and [Music] another but if you could hold the line in one area and say we going to stand with what a prophet taught regardless the devil will be powerless be powerless before you how many can say this morning Lord increase my endurance increase my courage increase my strength let me say Lord increase my ability this morning maybe you're here today and the devil's trying to drag you in and get you confused on this and listen church it's not just the enemy trying to confuse people on the gifts or on emotion or it's the tries to he tries to come in and interpret the seals interpret the pools and Brother David he tried to put the Thunders out of the church for 30 years but somewhere somebody's got to rise up and overcome by the word so I say why not you and why not now why not you young men why not you be the generation that the word of God abides in and your strength comes from the abiding yes sir word of [Music] God come on he's here this morning oh by his [Music] word oh yes by his word I shall not fail Oh by his word I'll

morning I shall bre by his word I not shall not fail by his word thank you Lord [Music] overcome by his word I'll Prevail I'll overcome as they play that softly this morning Spirit of the Lord just impressing on my heart to read this to you very strongly the prophet of God said Jesus never come to the Earth and died in vain he never taken a chance to come to Earth he wouldn't have did that no God don't run his office in heaven like that Loosely he came to the Earth to die for a purpose and not just to see if somebody well God before the foundation of the world forsaw the whole thing do you believe that he foresaw it by forn knowledge he forew it therefore he knew there was going to be a church called out without spot or wrinkle and there had to be preparations made to save that church so he sent Jesus not just perhaps somebody might be saved but he knew who was going to do it than he'd have a people called out and you are they that's right he'd have a people that would believe in Divine Healing and would accept the strapes for their healing and you are they God knew it he knew KN there'd be unbelievers there was then he knew they would be he forew it so therefore he could forese it would be that way and he for knew there'd be somebody who'd believe it so he sent Jesus for those who believe it and here they are today gathered here at one spot to accept what God fornew would take place thank God made a preparation for those who would believe and you're a part of that preparation God fornew before the world a was formed there were be here that's the reason he could foretell it he fornew it he made a preparation for those who would accept it and you are the people this morning that's come here to be prayed for that the preparation was made for God fornew it Oh my he said that Rouses the emotions of our souls and you notice the Holy Spirit when he takes the word and sets it across the congregation watch the emotions of the audience you know what I do then I know that God's presence is in the building when you see the way the effect it's a moving the people when you see just the word oh thank you Lord Brother Sean God by four knowledge looked all the way
