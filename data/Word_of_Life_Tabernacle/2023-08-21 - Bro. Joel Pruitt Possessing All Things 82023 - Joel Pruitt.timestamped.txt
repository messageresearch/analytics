[43:49] so lord it's worth coming together just
[43:51] to fill your presence
[43:53] God I pray you would move me out of the
[43:55] way and just
[43:56] let a blessing fall upon these people
[43:58] here tonight
[44:00] oh God it's nothing I can say to the
[44:02] people
[44:04] Lord you've been so good to us and Lord
[44:06] we believe that we want to return that
[44:08] tonight we want to return our love to
[44:11] you by worshiping you tonight in spirit
[44:14] and Truth
[44:16] but Lord we just ask Lord if there's one
[44:18] Among Us that needs salvation or refill
[44:22] into the Holy Ghost
[44:23] Lord anything that they would have need
[44:25] of tonight I pray that this could be
[44:27] their night
[44:29] Lord may we just go away from here
[44:31] better Christians
[44:33] Believers Lord and a message that can
[44:35] restore us back to all things that we
[44:37] have need of
[44:38] I pray you would just be with us now
[44:40] through the remainder of this service in
[44:42] Jesus name
[44:45] are you happy to be in the house of the
[44:46] Lord this afternoon
[44:49] I heard a few of you are the rest of you
[44:51] ate too much well praise the Lord
[44:53] I didn't eat too much at this time so
[44:55] maybe we can get through this but if you
[44:57] have your Bibles while you're standing
[44:58] turn to Second Corinthians chapter 6 and
[45:01] verse 10 we'll just read this one verse
[45:04] and then you can be seated
[45:05] second Corinthians 6 and 10 as sorrowful
[45:09] yet always rejoicing as poor
[45:13] yet making many rich
[45:15] as having nothing and yet possessing all
[45:19] things I wonder how many could say that
[45:21] together possessing all things that's us
[45:25] we are the possessors of all things you
[45:28] may be seated may the Lord had his
[45:29] blessings to the reading of the word
[45:33] the word possessing means having or
[45:37] holding by absolute right how many knows
[45:40] that to be true brother Branham teaches
[45:41] us that in the message we get this timer
[45:43] started here before I forget
[45:46] you all said Amen to that
[45:51] and so brother Braham talking about the
[45:52] possessing all things and there are
[45:54] several sermons there you can listen to
[45:56] where brother Brown speaks on possessing
[45:58] all things and and he actually goes in
[46:01] and he ties it with Abraham and and you
[46:03] know he's the father of Nations and he
[46:05] was given everything he could see he
[46:07] said you look this way and you look that
[46:09] way everything you can see is yours how
[46:10] many knows that to be true and if we are
[46:12] Heirs of Abraham's as Abraham's children
[46:15] then we also have the same promise that
[46:18] Abraham had you know that to be true
[46:20] tonight and so brother Brandon would say
[46:22] he said we find Abraham and in obedience
[46:24] left his home left his land and
[46:26] separated from everything all his
[46:28] Earthly possessions to travel in a
[46:30] Strange Land
[46:32] sojourning a type of the church he said
[46:36] we're asked to forsake everything that's
[46:38] in this world in order to follow Christ
[46:40] now that doesn't mean you can't live
[46:41] here you can't have jobs here you can't
[46:43] be around friends here but what it does
[46:45] is you have to lay down every sin that
[46:48] would so easily beset you and to keep
[46:50] you out of the promised land you cannot
[46:52] be tied to this world and expect to make
[46:54] a Rapture so you have got to move past
[46:57] this world and it's thinking it's
[46:58] understanding and maybe that maybe there
[47:01] would be an idea that a church would try
[47:02] to put upon you but what we have to do
[47:04] is follow the word and that's what
[47:06] Abraham did here he forsake he would
[47:08] forsake everything to follow after
[47:10] Christ
[47:12] and so he said we find Abraham following
[47:14] on year after year and he said he took
[47:16] some portion with him which was his
[47:18] father and he died right away and then
[47:20] he took his nephew which was lot and lot
[47:22] separated himself for argument's sake
[47:25] and went down to live in Sodom yet he
[47:27] was a part of Abraham imagine that he
[47:30] was already called out a part of Abraham
[47:33] and yet he wanted to go back why because
[47:35] it was attractive to him it looked like
[47:37] he could be something special there it
[47:38] looked like he could have a position
[47:39] there and yet if he went over here with
[47:41] Abraham we're going to be in a desert
[47:43] we're not going to have anything it
[47:45] looks like we're going to starve to
[47:46] death we're going to be poor and I can
[47:47] go back down here be the mayor of the
[47:49] city I can have look I can have position
[47:51] in the church I can do something special
[47:52] but that's not what God had called them
[47:55] to he had called them for something
[47:56] greater but he had to test them for a
[47:58] while Abraham was going to face Giants
[48:00] he was going to face Kings and he had to
[48:02] defeat all them to get the promise that
[48:04] was to come
[48:05] and so he said uh God gave the land and
[48:08] all that was in the land to Abraham and
[48:10] he was the heir of all of it God said
[48:12] look east west north and south and all
[48:15] of it belongs to you and to your seed
[48:18] how many Seed of Abraham do we have here
[48:19] today brother Brandon would call you
[48:21] Royal Seed of Abraham he said and so now
[48:24] one day Abraham had it kind of rough and
[48:27] lot was having it easy waiting in sin he
[48:30] said how easy it is and how pleasing sin
[48:33] looks to be and how innocent it looks if
[48:36] you're not careful Satan will trap you
[48:38] in a sin that does not look bad because
[48:41] you probably wouldn't do it but if he
[48:43] can get you to do something that's just
[48:45] a little bit wrong and then you go a
[48:46] little farther and a little more and a
[48:48] little bit more like this and then he
[48:49] could trap you into a situation but what
[48:52] God wants is not mixers with the world
[48:54] but he wants separators to be called out
[48:56] that does not mean to be separated from
[48:58] your brother from your sister but it
[49:00] means to leave everything that would
[49:01] hinder you from taking your land and
[49:04] your promise and so brother Brandon
[49:06] would go on he said he said now you say
[49:08] as long as I believe he said he said lot
[49:11] would say as long as I believe I believe
[49:12] in God so why can't I go down here and
[49:14] Sodom and it'll be all right I'm a
[49:16] Believer he said but it wasn't all right
[49:19] because just being a Believer is not
[49:21] enough to get you out of here but you've
[49:24] got to be obedient and be a believer
[49:26] because if you're a real believer then
[49:29] you're not going to leave the word
[49:30] beside and say well I'm just going to go
[49:31] on by my own carnal thinking
[49:34] brother random would say this multiple
[49:36] times and I pulled up a list of it the
[49:38] other day but he said God wants
[49:40] separators from the world and the world
[49:42] wants mixers
[49:44] and that's what the world wants why
[49:46] can't we all get along why can't we all
[49:47] just be together and be equal and and
[49:50] all these things but God wants
[49:52] separators to come out of the
[49:54] denominations but also to come out of
[49:56] the sin it's not enough just to sit in a
[49:58] message Pew or to sit in a message
[50:00] Church lot could do that lot could go to
[50:02] church every Sunday and say I'm a
[50:04] Believer
[50:05] but it wasn't good enough to get him out
[50:07] of the condition he was in I think
[50:09] people have got to be hungry enough to
[50:11] get out of the cold dead conditions to
[50:13] be called out you say brother I don't
[50:15] see a successful path that way but God
[50:18] didn't say I'm going to show you a bunch
[50:19] of glittery Stars over here and and
[50:21] you're going to be the best and you're
[50:22] going to be the mayor no he said just
[50:24] come and follow me we'll work out the
[50:26] details on the end
[50:28] but you've got to have faith to go this
[50:30] way
[50:31] it don't take any faith to go to Sodom
[50:33] and become popular it doesn't take any
[50:36] faith to go this way and and become one
[50:39] of the one of the elites but it takes
[50:41] Faith to go down here by yourself in the
[50:44] desert
[50:45] and not have any money not have any
[50:47] status it takes Faith to live like that
[50:49] and that's what Abraham's seed would do
[50:51] we may not be the biggest church in town
[50:53] but we can have the spirit of God Among
[50:55] Us because we're following the word of
[50:57] God
[50:59] brother Ram goes on he said see God when
[51:01] he called Abraham he called him to
[51:03] separate himself from everything and
[51:05] that's what we have to do
[51:06] God calls us to a total separation from
[51:09] sin he said come out from among it be
[51:12] not partakers of it shun it the very
[51:15] appearance of evil separation completely
[51:17] annihilated from it he said stay your
[51:20] distance away from it don't tread upon
[51:22] its grounds no matter how nice it looks
[51:26] so when the world can show you a better
[51:29] way that looks easy
[51:30] stay away from it don't tread on its
[51:33] grounds and we'll get to something here
[51:35] in a moment but brother Branham would go
[51:37] on down and he said he's talking about
[51:38] lot he said now see it looked like it
[51:40] was easy for a lot but remember lot had
[51:42] to pay the price as well he said now
[51:44] after this come up he said there comes a
[51:46] king that went on a war path with a
[51:48] little tribe of people and he swept down
[51:50] through the valley and took all the
[51:52] little groups little kingdoms out and
[51:53] and come into Sodom and took the king of
[51:55] Sodom and Gomorrah and took lot his wife
[51:58] his daughters his children all of them
[52:00] and all of their possession all they had
[52:02] and went right on out through cleaning
[52:04] out the country as it went he said oh
[52:05] what a horrible thing the wages of sin
[52:08] is death and he said lot realize no
[52:11] doubt walking along there and maybe with
[52:13] a rope or a chain around his neck as a
[52:15] slave his children young girls to be
[52:17] ravished and his wife and everything and
[52:19] and probably die at any time he
[52:21] disobeyed one order and maybe going into
[52:24] another kingdom somewhere to be a slave
[52:25] the rest of his days so what looked like
[52:28] a better way was death we don't know oh
[52:31] the end of all the situations we're
[52:33] going through but God who is rich in
[52:35] Mercy has called us to things that maybe
[52:38] we don't know but he knows the end time
[52:40] he knows what we're going through and he
[52:42] knows exactly that there will be a
[52:44] people that will follow him you're not
[52:46] going to go after the shiny and the
[52:48] glamor and the things of the world but
[52:50] what you're going after is the promise
[52:52] of a rapture
[52:54] that's what we want tonight we don't
[52:56] need just another uh another church and
[52:59] another big big preacher and and
[53:02] somebody stand up here and tell you how
[53:04] good you are you are you are the Seed of
[53:06] Abraham I can tell you you've got a
[53:08] promise
[53:09] but we've got to follow the word of God
[53:12] or else we'll fall in the same category
[53:13] of slot I'm not trying to beat anybody
[53:15] over the head I'm not trying to be
[53:17] hurtful or anything to you but we've got
[53:19] to follow the word for our day if we
[53:21] want to be called the elected seed of
[53:23] God
[53:24] God didn't call us just to to to follow
[53:27] along behind and say well I'll see how
[53:29] it turns out up front and then my maybe
[53:31] I'll Abraham could have said well
[53:33] show me what the end's going to be no he
[53:36] would have seen a time of Trials
[53:38] he would have seen happen to go fight
[53:40] kings take his servants and go fight
[53:42] kings that would come against him you
[53:45] know if if God could show you after you
[53:47] become a Christian what it's going to be
[53:48] like you might not have become a
[53:50] Christian
[53:52] oh come on somebody
[53:53] it's it's not a flowery bed of ease but
[53:55] it is a it is a rough way of going but
[53:59] God knows what it takes to get you to
[54:02] the end he knows what it takes to get
[54:04] you to have the faith that Abraham
[54:06] needed
[54:07] because when Abraham come among those
[54:09] Kings Brothers said he had no idea how
[54:11] to fight he had never fought in a war
[54:12] but he got his servants and they went
[54:14] down there and they slaughtered every
[54:16] one of them why because he knew he was
[54:18] in the will of God well I hope you hear
[54:20] me tonight church if you know you're in
[54:22] God's will then it takes all the
[54:24] guesswork out of it but it puts you in a
[54:26] position of faith and believing because
[54:28] you're no longer to say well I hope this
[54:30] is the will of God I hope this is the
[54:32] way I should go but if it's the word of
[54:34] God it's the will of God every time
[54:37] and in the will of God
[54:39] there will be freedom to worship
[54:42] in the will of God there'll be freedom
[54:44] to sit down by the tent and entertain
[54:47] the angel of the Lord
[54:50] see when you're in bondage like lot was
[54:53] he wished he could be where Abraham was
[54:55] when the angel of the Lord come by but
[54:58] see the angel of the Lord come to who
[55:00] Abraham and he comes to who now his seed
[55:03] after him and so what we need to do
[55:05] today is entertain the angel of the Lord
[55:08] because he's promised to come by us as
[55:10] well
[55:11] he didn't he didn't go down there a lot
[55:13] we we're not called out to be followers
[55:15] of Billy Graham or Oral Roberts or or
[55:18] The Messengers to Sodom they had a
[55:20] message and we appreciate that and thank
[55:22] God for it but we were called out by a
[55:24] messenger to show us that Christ was
[55:27] still alive and it should produce such a
[55:29] faith in us it should produce such a
[55:31] thing of inside of us that we would no
[55:33] longer be wanting to go back to the
[55:35] things of the world but we would be
[55:37] called out and we could be set aside so
[55:39] that when the angel comes by we can
[55:41] entertain him with our presence and we
[55:43] can worship him in the way we ought to
[55:45] we can say Lord I don't want to go back
[55:47] to the things of the world anymore but
[55:49] I've met the angel and now he's gave me
[55:51] a promise personally
[55:53] that's what we want we want to come
[55:55] aside and entertain the angel like we
[55:58] know we should because God has called us
[56:00] for such a time as this
[56:03] brother random said Abraham he found out
[56:05] that law had been taken
[56:07] that was a part of Abraham's possession
[56:10] Abraham might have said God you told me
[56:12] if I'd obey you and walk in here in this
[56:13] land you would give this to me it
[56:16] belongs to me even his heart went out to
[56:19] lot after lot had already made the wrong
[56:21] decision
[56:22] and his heart still went after lot he
[56:25] said and lots part of this and I'm going
[56:26] after him
[56:27] you got children out there today maybe
[56:30] they went after something fancy or
[56:31] something that that was a little bit
[56:33] glittery and you're like hey
[56:34] this was the way over here but you know
[56:36] you can't change their mind all you can
[56:38] do is say this is the way God has told
[56:40] us to go maybe they make the wrong
[56:41] decision but they're still part of the
[56:43] promise
[56:44] I'm thankful for that tonight we still
[56:46] have a promise he said so he garrisoned
[56:49] or gathered together as servants and put
[56:51] an arm on them and he took his servants
[56:53] down there and and took out until he
[56:56] pursued and found this King that King
[56:57] that had taken lot and his family
[56:59] captive he went and found him he said
[57:02] look what a great army they were then
[57:04] but under the directing of God the chief
[57:07] General he separated himself and fell in
[57:11] upon them and slaughtered the Kings and
[57:12] brought back lot and all the little
[57:14] kingdoms and brought them back to them
[57:16] to their Homeland again he said what a
[57:18] picture of Christ and Abraham there
[57:20] coming after the enemy had captured
[57:22] everything and Christ come and brought
[57:24] us back again that's what we are we have
[57:27] been redeemed from what we were I'd say
[57:29] there's many of us who went the way of
[57:31] law at times but God has sent his Angel
[57:34] down and he went after us
[57:36] he come down there and he said yes you
[57:38] went the wrong way yes you you and your
[57:40] family have went astray but God has said
[57:42] something in your hour to call you back
[57:44] and he said he said I'm going to bring
[57:47] you back to the land where I'll tell you
[57:48] what how do you know you're in the right
[57:49] land because in this land there's peace
[57:51] in this land there's joy in this land
[57:54] there there I'll tell you what there's
[57:55] not going to be a bunch of people
[57:56] sitting around trying to figure out
[57:58] who's bride and who's not no just come
[58:00] on over to the land and if you follow
[58:01] the word of the hour there's going to be
[58:03] a Rapture for you and for your family
[58:05] and for them that are far off
[58:08] we're not trying to sit over here and
[58:09] tell you how to well I've said this a
[58:11] lot and I'll say it again we're not
[58:13] trying to sit over here and dictate how
[58:14] you worship just come over and get in
[58:16] the land where the freedom is
[58:18] that's how you know brother Stewart was
[58:20] talking about the land last week and it
[58:21] got me thinking how do you know you're
[58:22] in the land
[58:23] because in the land there's no more
[58:25] bondage I'm not tied down to that King
[58:27] no more Abraham come down there oh I
[58:30] hope you hear me now Abraham had come
[58:32] down there with his servants
[58:34] oh I might do a little twist here on
[58:36] words but a prophet of God would come
[58:38] down here with his message his servants
[58:40] with the message of the hour would come
[58:42] down here and it would lose slot would
[58:45] loose you from your sins and from the
[58:47] way that you were and now you can walk
[58:49] freely because you come back to the land
[58:51] that God had prepared for you oh I hope
[58:53] you hear me tonight church we are not no
[58:55] longer in bondage we're no longer slaves
[58:58] we are no longer with a rope around our
[59:00] neck brother random said or a chain
[59:01] holding us back but we have found
[59:03] freedom in the message of the hour we
[59:05] have found joy in the message of the
[59:07] hour we have found all the promises of
[59:10] God in the message of the hour we are in
[59:13] the land of promise now we're not
[59:15] looking for it but it's here all you
[59:17] have to do is if you strayed from the
[59:19] land then come back to the land if you
[59:21] found yourself down there and you say
[59:23] well I'm in I'm in this certain church
[59:25] and and this church over here they made
[59:28] me a deacon or they made me a preacher
[59:29] but you know you're out of your position
[59:31] go back to your position even if it
[59:33] means you got humble yourself I bet lot
[59:36] wasn't a mayor no more but he still had
[59:38] to be brought back to the right land
[59:41] we don't need to be trying to go after
[59:43] position or status we need to be going
[59:45] after the word of God and he will put us
[59:47] in position for a rapture
[59:50] program said I like this
[59:52] he said Abraham was heir to All by The
[59:55] Promise
[59:56] so he could lay claim to everything that
[1:00:00] was in the land he oh I hope you hear me
[1:00:03] everything that is here tonight I'm not
[1:00:06] saying just in this church but if you
[1:00:07] have found your position in the land
[1:00:09] then God has claimed you for his own
[1:00:12] and then you have a promise that not
[1:00:15] just not not just Abraham's promise but
[1:00:18] you also have a promise of your seed as
[1:00:21] well
[1:00:22] because you are the Seed of Abraham and
[1:00:25] to you you and your children have the
[1:00:27] same promise but you must be an
[1:00:28] abrahamic people and have the same Faith
[1:00:31] he had well I hope you hear me now but
[1:00:33] if the people of God today would have
[1:00:35] the same faith that Abraham had then you
[1:00:37] can claim your children you can go after
[1:00:40] your lost loved ones just like Abraham
[1:00:42] would go after his heart or you don't
[1:00:44] have to be scared of the Kings down
[1:00:46] there that are holding them you don't
[1:00:47] have to be scared of the way that
[1:00:49] they're all entrapped in the world you
[1:00:50] say well you don't know how bad they are
[1:00:52] I don't know how bad they are but I know
[1:00:54] how bad I was and God went after me and
[1:00:57] God went after you some of you sitting
[1:00:59] here know as the preacher said this
[1:01:00] morning some of you know you shouldn't
[1:01:02] be here but you are here God who is rich
[1:01:05] in Mercy
[1:01:08] God come after you when you didn't
[1:01:11] deserve to become after
[1:01:14] he looked beyond your faults and saw a
[1:01:17] seed in there there was an abrahamic
[1:01:19] seed and he said that's my son or
[1:01:21] daughter that's my nephew that's my
[1:01:23] that's my grandson that's somebody that
[1:01:26] belongs to me because they were meant to
[1:01:28] be in the land
[1:01:31] oh you were meant to be in the land
[1:01:34] you were meant to live
[1:01:37] and be destroyed by Sodom but sometimes
[1:01:41] we all find ourselves in a position that
[1:01:45] lot was in
[1:01:46] because it looks so easy to be a sinner
[1:01:49] it looks so easy to just live like the
[1:01:53] world you don't get condemned
[1:01:55] for dressing like the world
[1:01:58] is that all right
[1:01:59] you don't get condemned
[1:02:01] for doing things like the world you know
[1:02:04] the world won't condemn you for sitting
[1:02:06] at home on Sunday
[1:02:08] and that's okay you know some can't be
[1:02:11] here and things like that I'm not
[1:02:11] talking about them but what I'm saying
[1:02:12] is the world would like you to do a
[1:02:14] certain thing
[1:02:15] I I read a statistic online and I don't
[1:02:18] remember the number but but the amount
[1:02:19] of people since covet who stay home and
[1:02:22] stream
[1:02:23] Now versus before has almost doubled
[1:02:27] now what happened kova didn't do it it
[1:02:29] may have for that year but now that the
[1:02:31] churches are open what is it people have
[1:02:33] found an easier way to worship God but
[1:02:36] there's no way like the Bible way to
[1:02:38] worship God he said come together and
[1:02:41] that much more as you see that day
[1:02:42] approach it then what is the believer is
[1:02:44] going to do they're going to say Amen to
[1:02:45] it and they're going to go to church
[1:02:47] when they can and get to get to those
[1:02:49] doors as soon as they can brother bear
[1:02:50] said if God is in your heart
[1:02:52] you can't wait for them Church doors to
[1:02:54] open at Young Yonder
[1:02:56] I understand there's I'm not preaching
[1:02:58] to anybody that's me it's easier to sit
[1:03:01] at home it's easier to go the way the
[1:03:03] world would want you to go there's a
[1:03:04] pattern that the world would like you to
[1:03:06] follow there's a pattern of the way they
[1:03:09] say well why don't you dress like the
[1:03:10] world well with a very statement dressed
[1:03:12] like the world is is alarming
[1:03:14] right because God's people didn't dress
[1:03:17] like the world
[1:03:19] so when they say dress like the world
[1:03:21] okay you want me to go back and dress
[1:03:22] like they did in Sodom and Gomorrah
[1:03:24] because we are a set-aside separated
[1:03:26] people we have to live here we have to
[1:03:29] be among them but we have to act
[1:03:30] different because Abraham he even had to
[1:03:33] get out of the country it got so bad
[1:03:34] down there but lot who was part of his
[1:03:37] seed and it was stuck down in there by
[1:03:39] the glamor and the things that were in
[1:03:40] the city and and because it was easier
[1:03:42] to live there maybe they had better
[1:03:43] water brother Ram said that Abraham was
[1:03:45] over here and he had to fight for his
[1:03:47] water and it was hot and he was in the
[1:03:49] desert and things didn't go easy for
[1:03:51] Abraham despite what people might tell
[1:03:52] you Abraham had a rough go of it
[1:03:55] and he said lot was having a pretty easy
[1:03:57] time but what did it do lot found
[1:04:01] himself in bondage by what he thought
[1:04:03] was easy and Abraham was set aside for
[1:04:07] service waiting on something and guess
[1:04:09] who came to Abraham the angel of the
[1:04:11] Lord so what you're going to get what
[1:04:13] you expect if you're over here living
[1:04:15] for the world you're going to fall into
[1:04:17] the traps of the world you're going to
[1:04:19] get what the world's got to offer you
[1:04:20] it'll be bondage it'll be it'll be a
[1:04:23] lust and and these bad immoral TV shows
[1:04:26] and uncensored television brother brand
[1:04:27] would call it and all these things like
[1:04:29] that but over here where Abraham was at
[1:04:31] oh there was a visitation from the angel
[1:04:33] of the Lord but he had to be expecting
[1:04:35] him to come and when he come he was
[1:04:37] ready to entertain I think if we would
[1:04:39] come to church that way sometimes be
[1:04:41] like I'm ready to entertain the angel of
[1:04:43] the Lord because I don't just want him
[1:04:45] to come I know he's coming
[1:04:48] I don't I don't just expect the church
[1:04:50] to be another service but I expect God
[1:04:53] to show up and change my life for the
[1:04:54] better I don't just come to be to be a
[1:04:57] number in the church or or say well it's
[1:05:00] easy because it's not easy going to
[1:05:02] church three times a week or two or
[1:05:03] whatever you can do but what it is it it
[1:05:05] is a it's a sacrifice but what we're
[1:05:08] doing is we're setting ourselves aside
[1:05:10] waiting for the visitation of the Angel
[1:05:12] who has promised that where two or three
[1:05:15] would gather I will be in the midst
[1:05:19] so that's what we want we want to be
[1:05:21] visit we want to have a visitation how
[1:05:24] many wants to visitation today we don't
[1:05:26] want to just be set over here in the
[1:05:28] world but we want a visitation from the
[1:05:30] from the angel of the Lord and I believe
[1:05:32] in our hour we have had that if we can
[1:05:34] just come over here and hear the word of
[1:05:36] God preach because the word of God today
[1:05:38] is the same word it is a revealed word
[1:05:41] just like it was to Abraham when the
[1:05:43] angel would come and he would tell him
[1:05:45] and he would he would turn his back to
[1:05:46] the tent and he would reveal the secrets
[1:05:48] of Sarah's thought do you realize the
[1:05:50] same Angel of the Lord has revealed
[1:05:52] himself again in our day and we can look
[1:05:54] back and say look we're not following
[1:05:56] after strange doctrines we're not
[1:05:57] following just another denomination but
[1:05:59] God has come down in the veil of human
[1:06:01] flesh and turned his back to the people
[1:06:03] and can tell you where you come from he
[1:06:06] can tell you what your name was he can
[1:06:08] tell you what you had need of and did
[1:06:10] you realize that that angel did not
[1:06:11] leave the scene when brother Brandon
[1:06:13] went home to be with the Lord but he's
[1:06:14] here in the bride today because he said
[1:06:17] ask what you will and it shall be given
[1:06:19] to you I say whatever you say whatsoever
[1:06:22] you have need of if you have need of
[1:06:24] something God can give it to you today
[1:06:26] it's not by might not by power but by
[1:06:29] the spirit of God that is here among the
[1:06:31] people today oh I'll tell you well
[1:06:33] that's why I don't want to sit in the
[1:06:34] dead church because I want to be in a
[1:06:36] church that's got Authority when they
[1:06:37] have a sickness we can gather together
[1:06:39] you can call for the elders and they can
[1:06:41] lay hands on you we don't just do that
[1:06:43] just for a show we do it because we
[1:06:45] believe if we do according to the word
[1:06:47] of God then God's going to show up and
[1:06:49] he's going to change lives and heal the
[1:06:51] sick and raise the dead or I'll tell you
[1:06:53] what take the limits off of God today
[1:06:55] and you'll realize that there are
[1:06:57] resources that have not even been tapped
[1:06:59] into yet because God is still a Healer
[1:07:02] God is still a saver of souls today oh I
[1:07:05] don't want to hear that stuff about it's
[1:07:06] over if God has placed a calling in your
[1:07:09] life then that tells me it's not over
[1:07:11] for you yet if God has come down and he
[1:07:13] said listen you're one of mine and he's
[1:07:15] called you out of Sodom and he said I
[1:07:17] want you to come over here with a
[1:07:19] Abraham's group God is not calling
[1:07:21] someone who is lost but he's calling
[1:07:24] someone who has a Seed of Abraham on the
[1:07:26] inside He is wanting you oh I hope you
[1:07:29] hear me now he wants you more than you
[1:07:32] want him
[1:07:34] sir
[1:07:36] he wants to give you something
[1:07:38] that maybe you don't even know you won't
[1:07:40] yet Abraham did not know what was coming
[1:07:42] but he knew that if he followed the word
[1:07:45] of God he would be a possessor of all
[1:07:48] things brother random would say I don't
[1:07:49] have time to read it all I'm running out
[1:07:51] of time already he said Abraham was the
[1:07:53] poorest man in all the country
[1:07:54] you know that
[1:07:57] Abraham was the poorest man in all the
[1:07:58] country because he lived out in the
[1:08:00] desert and lived in peace with God
[1:08:03] sounds like a pretty good place for the
[1:08:05] Helen
[1:08:07] he lived in peace with God and lot was
[1:08:10] rich
[1:08:11] and lived in the city now but the brand
[1:08:12] is not knocking you before being rich
[1:08:14] and telling you you got to be poor he's
[1:08:16] not doing any of that
[1:08:18] but you have to be careful
[1:08:20] where your priorities are when you get
[1:08:22] to this position so if God gives you
[1:08:24] something
[1:08:26] then you better know how to handle it or
[1:08:27] he's not going to give it to you right
[1:08:29] if he gives you lots of money if you're
[1:08:31] a seed of God he's not going to just let
[1:08:33] you be the richest man in the world
[1:08:34] unless he knows you can handle it and
[1:08:36] benefit the kingdom of God that's just
[1:08:38] as simple as I can put it he said and he
[1:08:40] said and he lived in peace with God he
[1:08:42] said but lot was rich and lived in the
[1:08:44] city and become governor of the city he
[1:08:47] said in the gate he was a judge and
[1:08:49] judge the city and had all the riches
[1:08:52] and things but Abraham was in the desert
[1:08:55] perhaps the poorest man in the land and
[1:08:57] yet a claim to possess all
[1:09:01] somebody say oh
[1:09:04] he had claimed to possess all
[1:09:07] he said that's what I like oh tonight we
[1:09:10] may not be rich in this world's Goods
[1:09:12] but we possess all things
[1:09:17] so you may not look like the richest
[1:09:19] person in hearty or fair or wherever you
[1:09:21] live
[1:09:22] but you are a possessor of all things
[1:09:26] the Earth you stand on is yours
[1:09:29] the air you breathe is yours everything
[1:09:33] that you look around you say well well
[1:09:35] that was for Abraham brother Brandon
[1:09:37] would say it like this he said if a rich
[1:09:39] man leaves his son money no matter if
[1:09:41] he's a drunkard
[1:09:42] no matter what he's been doing no matter
[1:09:45] how bad that person is if his father
[1:09:48] left him an inheritance is his
[1:09:50] inheritance
[1:09:51] now I don't care how you've lived I
[1:09:53] don't care what you've done if your
[1:09:55] father has left you an inheritance it's
[1:09:58] yours to possess
[1:10:00] I don't care what you've done you say
[1:10:02] you don't know what my past is but I
[1:10:04] know your future because the word has
[1:10:07] come and told me so
[1:10:08] come on I was lost
[1:10:11] and I'm done
[1:10:13] but God
[1:10:15] he sent somebody
[1:10:17] and he loved you so much
[1:10:19] you know you think of God as being a god
[1:10:20] of wrath and
[1:10:22] and he is he hates sin he hates all
[1:10:24] these things but he loved you so much
[1:10:27] that he took his only son
[1:10:30] and let him die for you
[1:10:33] so that you could possess eternal life
[1:10:36] now reverse order Jesus himself could
[1:10:40] have possessed eternal life himself
[1:10:42] never had to die
[1:10:44] and you would be lost
[1:10:46] but in order to possess
[1:10:48] The Inheritance that God was going to
[1:10:50] give you he had to sacrifice something
[1:10:54] so is it today for the believer if you
[1:10:57] want the blessings that God has for you
[1:10:59] you may have to sacrifice something
[1:11:03] to possess all things you may not get
[1:11:06] what you want all the time but you will
[1:11:08] possess
[1:11:09] eternal life it don't really matter what
[1:11:12] you know it's just a space of time we
[1:11:14] live here brother Danny and some of you
[1:11:16] men brother Bill you've been here and
[1:11:17] you can you can look back on that he's
[1:11:18] talking about the 70s earlier and things
[1:11:20] like that you look back and really we
[1:11:22] had you hadn't been here that long
[1:11:24] to us young people it looks like you've
[1:11:26] been around a while but you hadn't been
[1:11:27] here that long you know time goes by
[1:11:29] like that your kids are grown and I look
[1:11:31] around and I'm just a kid and I've got
[1:11:34] kids
[1:11:35] but you know what it is
[1:11:37] time this goes back we're just in a
[1:11:38] little space of time here
[1:11:40] and yes we want to be comfortable where
[1:11:41] we're at and we should provide things
[1:11:44] for our kids and do things we should do
[1:11:45] all those things but don't forget the
[1:11:48] main thing
[1:11:49] because the main thing is show your
[1:11:51] children away to eternal life because
[1:11:54] just like lot the the shiny things are
[1:11:58] going to pass away the shiny things may
[1:12:00] even put you in bondage but you've got
[1:12:03] to be called out of the shiny things
[1:12:05] into a glow of the spirit of God in your
[1:12:08] life you've got to move away from things
[1:12:10] that are just so pretty and maybe you've
[1:12:12] got it so easy brother I think it's time
[1:12:14] that if we look at and you say well
[1:12:16] brother Joel I haven't had it easy well
[1:12:19] don't don't complain about it thank God
[1:12:20] for the rough things you've had to go
[1:12:22] through because he's the one that
[1:12:24] brought you through them
[1:12:25] oh I think we we blame God for putting
[1:12:28] us through rough things let's thank him
[1:12:29] for bringing him through bringing us
[1:12:31] through that's what we need let's just
[1:12:33] give God praise when we come to the
[1:12:35] house of God let's give God thanks for
[1:12:37] what we've got let's give God praise for
[1:12:39] what we've caught because it may not be
[1:12:41] what we wanted but it's what we needed
[1:12:43] and that we are a possessor of all
[1:12:45] things you say well I don't have what I
[1:12:47] want I don't have the nicest car or the
[1:12:48] nicest truck it don't really matter what
[1:12:50] you got here because over there your
[1:12:52] father owns a cattle on a thousand hills
[1:12:54] and I believe I'll tell you what I
[1:12:56] believe you are an heir to every one of
[1:12:58] them
[1:13:00] God rich in Mercy made you an heir
[1:13:04] of all the promises
[1:13:07] brother bam talks about he said today
[1:13:08] the True Believer is cast out from among
[1:13:11] the people
[1:13:12] called a fanatic
[1:13:14] a Holy Roller
[1:13:15] take this off I'm about that time
[1:13:18] I'll ruin it
[1:13:22] The Fanatic or Holy Roller he said
[1:13:25] some kind of a religious fanatic
[1:13:27] and yet is heir to the whole heavens
[1:13:31] and Earth
[1:13:33] blessed are the meek they shall inherit
[1:13:35] the earth he said oh my talk about push
[1:13:37] you out in a cabin or somewhere and
[1:13:39] hardly enough money to pay your rent yet
[1:13:40] you own it all
[1:13:41] see God doesn't judge you by your status
[1:13:43] here on Earth he judges you by your
[1:13:46] status in heaven what have you given to
[1:13:48] God well you know brother being preached
[1:13:50] this morning can we give everything we
[1:13:53] got can we give him our best can we do
[1:13:55] for God you know what we want to do for
[1:13:57] our children we want to give him the
[1:13:59] best we can we want to work for him we
[1:14:01] want to we want to take them places and
[1:14:03] have fun with them you think God doesn't
[1:14:05] want to do the same for us God wants you
[1:14:07] to be happy he wants you to be healthy
[1:14:09] but see he lets us go through child
[1:14:11] training sometimes so that we can see
[1:14:14] the goodness of God so that we can see
[1:14:16] that that even though we failed him many
[1:14:19] times even though we didn't deserve to
[1:14:21] be taken out and taken on this wonderful
[1:14:24] thing we're calling a Rapture and taking
[1:14:26] up out of here we didn't deserve any of
[1:14:27] that but God who is rich in Mercy said
[1:14:30] you know what you are my seed I promised
[1:14:33] up Abraham and I promise to you and I
[1:14:36] promise to all them afarov as many as
[1:14:38] the Lord God would call I promised every
[1:14:40] one of you eternal life and I won't
[1:14:42] leave one of you behind I'm going to
[1:14:44] take you with me
[1:14:46] he said
[1:14:49] he said have to work and toil and sweat
[1:14:51] for a few dollars to make an honest
[1:14:52] living to put shoes on your children's
[1:14:53] feet and feed their hungry he said he
[1:14:55] said but yet you possess he said Oh my
[1:14:57] he said I like that possessor of the
[1:14:59] earth he said what is it the believer
[1:15:02] how many Believers we have here today he
[1:15:04] said what is it to believe or he said he
[1:15:06] said the believer has a title an
[1:15:07] abstract deed that's right by Jesus
[1:15:10] Christ that he shall be the possessor of
[1:15:12] the entire universe he said that's right
[1:15:15] the meek shall inherit oh I think we've
[1:15:17] got to defeat some enemies today to
[1:15:19] possess what God has for us because he's
[1:15:21] going to try to hold you down by the
[1:15:23] things of the world say well I'm poor
[1:15:25] and I've got to be rich that's Satan
[1:15:26] trying to play on your emotions the main
[1:15:28] thing is be rich in love be rich in Hope
[1:15:30] be rich in faith and God will add to
[1:15:33] these things he will he will bless you
[1:15:35] he will bless Abraham's seed you don't
[1:15:37] ever have to beg for bread God will
[1:15:39] provide for you in your time of need but
[1:15:41] the main thing is you're following God
[1:15:43] and not going after the things of the
[1:15:45] world
[1:15:47] he said I'd apply it today this is the
[1:15:49] application part brother Graham said I'd
[1:15:51] apply it today I'd say the church could
[1:15:54] say Lord God
[1:15:55] here's my brother he's talking about
[1:15:56] sickness here
[1:15:58] he said he's laying here stricken with
[1:15:59] cancer he's stricken with tuberculosis
[1:16:01] he's got so and so he said I lay hold of
[1:16:04] a promise
[1:16:05] it's my possession you got kidney
[1:16:08] problems you've got headaches all the
[1:16:11] time or backaches or or cancer or or
[1:16:14] whatever it is or or you know let's just
[1:16:16] bring it home maybe you've got a lust
[1:16:17] problem or or maybe you've got something
[1:16:19] that's it's not a health but maybe it's
[1:16:21] maybe it's a spiritual problem maybe
[1:16:22] you're cold in your walk do you realize
[1:16:24] the promise that you have and that you
[1:16:26] don't have to stay there you can be
[1:16:28] called out into the land where the
[1:16:29] promises are
[1:16:31] I think In the Flesh we get in those the
[1:16:33] land where the promises have been taken
[1:16:35] away from us but if you get back in your
[1:16:37] position
[1:16:38] now where is the believer's position in
[1:16:40] Christ
[1:16:42] and Christ is the word so if if I am in
[1:16:45] the word if I am walking according to
[1:16:47] the word then God is obligated
[1:16:51] you say we don't use that word God is
[1:16:53] obligated to provide for you if you'll
[1:16:56] follow his word
[1:16:58] well that's uh it takes Faith first you
[1:17:01] have to believe that the word is true
[1:17:02] and then you can lay aside everything
[1:17:04] else that would hurt you from following
[1:17:07] the word say Lord I have to give this up
[1:17:09] to follow the word but I'm going to
[1:17:10] follow it anyway what are you doing
[1:17:11] you're taking a step of abrahamic faith
[1:17:14] brother Brian would call it and when you
[1:17:16] do that then you take that step of faith
[1:17:18] and I promise you God will provide for
[1:17:22] your knees God will not leave you
[1:17:24] comfortless but he will come to you with
[1:17:25] the Holy Ghost he will not leave you
[1:17:27] begging for bread he said I've never
[1:17:29] seen seen his seed forsaken or a seed
[1:17:32] begging for bread and he will not do it
[1:17:34] for you either you said brother Joel
[1:17:35] I've been I've been poor I've been broke
[1:17:37] I've been there too but God is not
[1:17:39] leaving you helpless and hopeless and
[1:17:41] and all these things but what he's doing
[1:17:43] he's trying to bring you back to a place
[1:17:46] of grace and mercy did you ever see a
[1:17:48] child when they're walking and you hold
[1:17:50] their hand and they fall down you know
[1:17:52] the worst thing you can do is pick them
[1:17:53] up and hold them but let them get back
[1:17:55] up and try to walk again and God's doing
[1:17:57] the same thing for you to day he's
[1:17:59] letting you fall down and take your
[1:18:00] lumps here because it's like a man said
[1:18:03] one time he said this is boot camp God's
[1:18:05] teaching you how to walk by faith down
[1:18:07] here
[1:18:08] is that right
[1:18:10] you say what man why did why did God
[1:18:12] give me a harder road than you he knew
[1:18:13] you needed it
[1:18:16] sometimes I wonder
[1:18:18] but it will be worth it all
[1:18:21] when we're in the land
[1:18:23] a promise
[1:18:25] he said brother I'm talking about the
[1:18:27] going after your enemy
[1:18:29] to lay the whole to lay hold of your
[1:18:30] possession that's what Abraham did
[1:18:32] he went after the enemy
[1:18:34] he didn't go back down to Sodom and say
[1:18:36] you know I guess I'll hang out here for
[1:18:37] a while and see if they come back no he
[1:18:38] went after the enemy
[1:18:40] the enemy's trying to bind you today
[1:18:41] you're trying to bind your worship
[1:18:44] come on somebody he's trying to bind
[1:18:46] your your family
[1:18:48] he's trying to bind you to a sickness
[1:18:51] he's trying to bind you
[1:18:53] by Financial struggles he's trying to
[1:18:55] buy into your mind
[1:18:57] but I challenge you today to go after
[1:18:59] that enemy and take back what's yours
[1:19:03] I challenge you not to leave it there
[1:19:05] and let it go undone I say bring it back
[1:19:08] and it's yours bring that thing under
[1:19:11] subjection because whatever you speak in
[1:19:13] this age
[1:19:15] can be the saith the Lord because it's
[1:19:17] going to the word what does that say of
[1:19:19] the Lord what the word of God is
[1:19:21] so you say I have a promise that's the
[1:19:23] saith the Lord I'm going after my family
[1:19:25] that's the saith the Lord I'm going
[1:19:28] after all those that that that that have
[1:19:31] misused me and I'm gonna I'm gonna say
[1:19:33] you know what I forgive you that's a
[1:19:35] Biblical principle I say that's the
[1:19:37] saith the Lord
[1:19:39] if it's in the word of God we can go
[1:19:41] boldly and say I'll take it back
[1:19:44] everything that the devil stole from me
[1:19:46] I'm taking back my joy I'm taking back
[1:19:49] my peace I'm going to live in the land
[1:19:51] of promises where all the promises are
[1:19:53] why because God has given it to Abraham
[1:19:56] and I'm his seed I'm heir to it all
[1:20:01] he said
[1:20:02] go after that enemy that devil and
[1:20:05] Slaughter it just the same as Abraham
[1:20:08] slaughtered the Kings
[1:20:10] and brought back his possession he said
[1:20:13] amen I like that it's to the believer
[1:20:14] Abraham had a right to the promise did
[1:20:17] you know you have a right to the promise
[1:20:18] can you say amen and the promise was his
[1:20:21] yet he had to fight to possess it he
[1:20:23] said amen there you are the believer
[1:20:25] today yet we're heir to all things
[1:20:29] he said we're going to have to fight for
[1:20:31] it
[1:20:32] but you're heir to it that seems strange
[1:20:34] doesn't it
[1:20:36] why don't you just give it to me Lord
[1:20:37] because he wants to see
[1:20:40] if you'll fight for it
[1:20:42] are you
[1:20:44] are you willing to fight for it
[1:20:46] are you willing to fight for what God
[1:20:48] has given to you are you willing to
[1:20:50] fight for your god-given rights
[1:20:53] well come on somebody
[1:20:55] you're either willing to fight for it or
[1:20:57] it ain't worth having in the first place
[1:20:58] but I say today if you want your
[1:21:00] children back fight for them if you want
[1:21:03] the spirit of God back in the services
[1:21:05] again fight for it
[1:21:07] don't sit there and give in to what the
[1:21:09] devil's trying to tell you fight for
[1:21:11] your god-given right
[1:21:12] fight for what's yours it's not fighting
[1:21:15] for something that somebody else has got
[1:21:16] it's fighting for your own right
[1:21:18] God doesn't just give things to you
[1:21:20] though he wants you to have it but he
[1:21:22] wants you to get up and walk and come
[1:21:24] and take a step and I remember when when
[1:21:26] Jason was a little boy if he wanted
[1:21:28] something
[1:21:29] and he was just learning to walk we'd
[1:21:31] hold out something he liked and wanted
[1:21:34] and you know
[1:21:35] sometimes he'd crawl and we wouldn't
[1:21:37] give it to him
[1:21:38] but he'd get up and try to walk and we'd
[1:21:40] you know he could come and find it going
[1:21:42] to find out he's a better Walker than he
[1:21:43] thought he was some sometimes you got
[1:21:45] more faith than you think you do
[1:21:48] is that right sometimes you just gotta
[1:21:50] go take the land of promise and defeat
[1:21:53] the devils in your way they're bigger
[1:21:55] than you are defeat them anyway they've
[1:21:58] got oh brother brother Joel you don't
[1:21:59] know how how much of a hole they've got
[1:22:01] on me I'll quit giving them so much
[1:22:02] praise and go take the land quit giving
[1:22:05] the devil all the glory and go take what
[1:22:07] God's given to you
[1:22:10] God's a big God he's a good God
[1:22:12] but he wants to see his children
[1:22:14] respond sometimes
[1:22:17] he wants to see if you're willing to
[1:22:19] fight
[1:22:20] for your possession
[1:22:22] because all things are yours
[1:22:24] you can possess them but you got to
[1:22:26] fight for it
[1:22:27] we're going down here and try to close
[1:22:29] I'm running out of time I've got three
[1:22:31] minutes left
[1:22:33] you think I'll stay with it
[1:22:36] brother Brian said if you've never
[1:22:37] received the Holy Ghost as yet
[1:22:39] don't know nothing about it
[1:22:41] something in your heart telling you want
[1:22:43] it
[1:22:43] he said stay right there and fight for
[1:22:45] it
[1:22:47] don't give up easy
[1:22:49] you know when you want something bad
[1:22:50] enough you won't give up
[1:22:52] he said stay right there he said that's
[1:22:54] eternal life
[1:22:55] that's what you're heir to stay right
[1:22:57] there he said look Satan right in the
[1:23:00] face and say you are the robber you're
[1:23:03] the one
[1:23:04] he said I've come to possess what Jesus
[1:23:07] Christ died for me to have now hand it
[1:23:09] back
[1:23:10] he said get out of my way
[1:23:12] sometimes you got to talk to the devil
[1:23:14] like that get out of my way Satan I'm
[1:23:16] coming to take what's mine
[1:23:19] he said then the first thing you know
[1:23:20] the Holy Ghost will pour upon you and
[1:23:22] something happens he said what is it God
[1:23:26] Vindicated that he keeps his word
[1:23:29] he said that's just exactly he said then
[1:23:32] after you see the word is Vindicated to
[1:23:33] you you are saved
[1:23:36] he said what do you he said do you have
[1:23:39] the Holy Ghost then what Abraham had won
[1:23:41] the Victory and here he come marching
[1:23:43] back he was going down with his faith
[1:23:46] laying on the word that he could bring
[1:23:48] it back what he had lost and here he
[1:23:50] come back with it marching the Victor's
[1:23:53] March he said that's the same thing you
[1:23:55] can do if you don't have eternal life
[1:23:57] ask God that's what he said just ask God
[1:24:00] confess your sins believe on the Son of
[1:24:03] God accept the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:24:05] and say God I come for it I'm here to
[1:24:08] receive it then you come back on the
[1:24:10] Victor's March I think it's time to see
[1:24:13] some victory marches back in church I
[1:24:15] think it's time when we see we've
[1:24:16] already come we've already fought it out
[1:24:18] with the devil well I'll tell you what
[1:24:20] it was a hard fight but we're still here
[1:24:22] I've got the victory I'm on the victory
[1:24:25] march today that's why I I don't see it
[1:24:28] I don't see why we should come and feel
[1:24:30] all defeated at church because the fact
[1:24:32] that you made it ought to put you on the
[1:24:34] victory march the fact that you're here
[1:24:36] I I look and see people sitting here
[1:24:38] that maybe shouldn't have been here
[1:24:39] maybe you wasn't here maybe he was in
[1:24:41] the world just a few years ago but you
[1:24:43] hear that's why you're on the victory
[1:24:45] march tonight and you say I'll tell you
[1:24:47] what I was down there in Sodom I was
[1:24:50] chained the Kings had come and got me
[1:24:51] the kings of the world the
[1:24:53] principalities of the air they were
[1:24:54] trying to come after me but there was a
[1:24:56] message to come down and got a hold of
[1:24:58] me and it took chains off of me oh my
[1:25:00] and he said I am one of yours and God
[1:25:03] had come down there and got a hold of me
[1:25:05] where I was where I was dead and sin and
[1:25:07] trespasses but he didn't leave me there
[1:25:09] he brought me out and now I'm sitting
[1:25:11] with the other believers in the house of
[1:25:13] God in Heavenly places where all things
[1:25:16] are possible where the heavenlies are
[1:25:18] you can ask what you will you can say to
[1:25:21] this mountain be moved and if it needs
[1:25:23] to be moved then it'll be moved but
[1:25:25] listen to me Church what you got to do
[1:25:27] is you've got to believe the promises
[1:25:29] for your age you've got to believe the
[1:25:30] promises for your hour I believe today
[1:25:33] there is going to be a little group that
[1:25:35] is getting ready for a Rapture you may
[1:25:36] not look like the world's best but God
[1:25:39] has called you out you may not look like
[1:25:41] the mayor of the city but God has called
[1:25:43] you out you may not look like somebody
[1:25:44] that we would pick for president but God
[1:25:47] has called you out and sets you aside he
[1:25:50] said I'm not going after the elite
[1:25:51] necessarily but I'm going after the meek
[1:25:53] because they are going to inherit the
[1:25:56] earth they are here because of grace of
[1:25:58] God they are here because I wasn't gonna
[1:26:01] lose one of them oh come on somebody you
[1:26:03] are here because God had saw you in the
[1:26:07] shape you were in and he said I'm not
[1:26:08] leaving you there but I'm sending my son
[1:26:10] for you he's already died oh I don't
[1:26:13] even see your sin no more because I
[1:26:15] promised son that came and the promise
[1:26:17] happened we can say today this day that
[1:26:20] scripture was fulfilled because we can
[1:26:22] see our young people coming back to the
[1:26:24] Lord we can see our old people getting
[1:26:26] on fire for the Lord we can see our
[1:26:28] brothers acting like men we can see our
[1:26:31] sisters dressing like sisters what is it
[1:26:33] it is a promise of the hour we are
[1:26:35] possessing that Promise by living out
[1:26:37] the word as the Bride of the end time I
[1:26:40] wish somebody had preached with me for a
[1:26:41] minute God has not given you just
[1:26:43] another organizational idea but he has
[1:26:46] given you a possession he has given you
[1:26:48] the attitude that I'm going to take
[1:26:49] what's mine I'm going to take back what
[1:26:51] the devil stole from me I'm not leaving
[1:26:53] it down there oh come on somebody you
[1:26:56] say well I just don't feel good in
[1:26:58] church no more because when not having
[1:26:59] services like we used to well whose
[1:27:01] fault is that the angel of the Lord is
[1:27:03] here I say it's time that we act like
[1:27:06] that the angel of the Lord is here
[1:27:07] entertain him while he comes by
[1:27:09] entertaining when he's moving Among Us
[1:27:11] don't act like a dead formal Baptist
[1:27:14] Church member but if he's here and you
[1:27:16] know he's here because why a promise of
[1:27:19] God's hand where two or three we're
[1:27:21] together is there two or three with me
[1:27:23] here this afternoon then the presence of
[1:27:25] God is here and where he is there is
[1:27:27] Liberty to Worship in the way that some
[1:27:29] will call crazy some will say that's out
[1:27:31] of order but we're going to worship
[1:27:32] anyway some will tell you you can't
[1:27:34] praise God like that in a mess oh come
[1:27:36] on somebody God may say you may say you
[1:27:40] can't worship like that in the message
[1:27:41] church because that's how to order
[1:27:43] I say get out of order for a while and
[1:27:46] have church I say get out of order for a
[1:27:48] while and let God move on your families
[1:27:50] again
[1:27:53] get out of order long enough
[1:27:55] to see the salvation
[1:27:57] go down there and take what's yours
[1:28:01] and then do the victory march
[1:28:04] that's what he said dude
[1:28:07] that's what he said to do
[1:28:10] well take what's yours
[1:28:14] Moses went down to Egypt and I'm about
[1:28:16] to close don't get scared
[1:28:18] Moses went down to Egypt
[1:28:21] and he come out with all them people
[1:28:23] and after they defeated
[1:28:25] the object in the way
[1:28:28] they had to go through what a challenge
[1:28:30] of faith
[1:28:31] God wanted to see are you going to go
[1:28:33] are you going to run back there to
[1:28:34] Pharaoh's Army
[1:28:35] but no they they realized that in their
[1:28:37] age there was a Vindicated Prophet among
[1:28:39] them
[1:28:40] there was somebody that was called to
[1:28:43] call them out
[1:28:45] and all they had to do
[1:28:47] was to follow the word for the day
[1:28:50] and if they did
[1:28:52] there was life on the other side
[1:28:54] and it might get misused and misquoted
[1:28:56] but I'll say this once they come out and
[1:28:58] they could look behind them and they
[1:29:00] could see Pharaoh's Army was dead I say
[1:29:03] once you've seen that devil that has
[1:29:05] been defeated in your life once you've
[1:29:07] overcome sickness once you've overcome
[1:29:10] some sort of a sin that is trying to
[1:29:11] hold you back once you've overcome
[1:29:13] something in your life you can shout
[1:29:15] like nobody else because those people in
[1:29:18] the sea couldn't shout no more they were
[1:29:19] the deadest church members in the land
[1:29:21] but there was somebody
[1:29:23] there was somebody shouting it wasn't
[1:29:26] those that were drowned with Pharaoh's
[1:29:27] Bunch it was the people who'd come
[1:29:30] through it was God's people that could
[1:29:32] shout and dance like nobody why because
[1:29:35] they had overcome the world they had
[1:29:37] come out on the other side and I say
[1:29:39] today church it's time that we overcome
[1:29:41] our sin that is holding us back you say
[1:29:43] what is that sin I don't know examine
[1:29:46] your own life and say Lord I'm giving
[1:29:47] that back to the devil where it come
[1:29:49] from and I'm going to worship the house
[1:29:51] in the house of God in the way they call
[1:29:53] crazy I'm gonna act like a fool because
[1:29:56] I'm here to give God glory I'm here to
[1:29:59] give God praise I'm not here just to
[1:30:02] show up I'm not here just to be another
[1:30:04] preacher I'm not here just to be another
[1:30:06] church member I'm not here just to sing
[1:30:09] another song but I'm here to put my
[1:30:11] praise with your praise and stomp on the
[1:30:13] head of the devil put your head on the
[1:30:15] neck of that devil and say Satan you're
[1:30:17] a liar Satan you can't have my family
[1:30:19] Satan you can't have this church you
[1:30:22] can't have us the girls were marching on
[1:30:24] in Victory
[1:30:28] how many people's gonna march on in
[1:30:30] Victory you say but it's Sunday
[1:30:31] afternoon I'm tired
[1:30:34] where'd you get that tiredness back to
[1:30:36] the devil where it come from and March
[1:30:37] on in Victory
[1:30:40] oh come on somebody
[1:30:42] I'm out of time
[1:30:43] I should have said it for 45 instead of
[1:30:45] 40.
[1:30:47] can somebody say praise the Lord
[1:30:49] and some has anybody overcome
[1:30:53] and anybody there ever come something I
[1:30:55] don't know you name it don't have to
[1:30:57] name it out loud praise the Lord but you
[1:30:59] name it whatever is it whatever you
[1:31:00] think of I've overcome something I'll
[1:31:03] guarantee you every one of you has
[1:31:04] overcome something think back to what
[1:31:06] God did for you
[1:31:08] and then try to keep us quiet if you
[1:31:10] want to because I can look back and say
[1:31:13] I shouldn't have been here
[1:31:16] I didn't believe in Preachers
[1:31:20] I was over there sitting I said good
[1:31:24] people sitting there
[1:31:26] saying well the preachers got it all
[1:31:27] messed up
[1:31:29] preachers are all wrong
[1:31:30] I've never heard a good one I guess
[1:31:33] I know
[1:31:35] but no you know Satan will try to blind
[1:31:37] you by something and sometimes he'll use
[1:31:39] something close to the word
[1:31:42] but remember if it's one word off get
[1:31:44] away from it
[1:31:46] so if Satan says you can have some of
[1:31:49] your children
[1:31:50] get away from it
[1:31:52] if Satan says well you can say a man in
[1:31:55] church but don't you dare shout
[1:31:57] hallelujah
[1:31:59] say Satan take that
[1:32:02] you can sing in church but it better I'm
[1:32:04] gonna get myself in trouble you can sing
[1:32:06] in church but it better be songs from
[1:32:08] the 50s and 60s
[1:32:11] because the new ones aren't anointed
[1:32:12] well come on somebody
[1:32:14] you know
[1:32:16] people aren't bad to say that but Satan
[1:32:18] will use good people to say bad things
[1:32:20] to hinder your walk in the Lord
[1:32:23] I'm not saying people are bad I'm saying
[1:32:25] that don't let Satan talk to you I don't
[1:32:26] care how it is I don't care what he says
[1:32:28] if it's not in the word leave it alone
[1:32:30] stomp on that devil and then get back in
[1:32:33] here worship God
[1:32:35] well that's all right this none of this
[1:32:38] is in my notes I'm so far off of I don't
[1:32:40] know where I'm at but let me tell you
[1:32:42] this
[1:32:42] you can't stay away from where the
[1:32:45] presence of God is if you're an eagle
[1:32:47] because where the carcass is where the
[1:32:49] word of God is
[1:32:51] and there will be an atmosphere you ever
[1:32:52] been around a carcass
[1:32:54] there will be an atmosphere
[1:32:59] hahaha
[1:33:03] right
[1:33:05] now Eagles don't feed on dead carcasses
[1:33:08] right
[1:33:09] if you if you're smelling that kind of
[1:33:10] stuff you're in the wrong Church
[1:33:12] if it smells dead get away from it
[1:33:15] but as Eagles
[1:33:17] we have looked down there and you can
[1:33:18] fly over the highest you can be however
[1:33:21] I didn't go to school I don't know how
[1:33:22] high an eagle flies but you can look
[1:33:24] down in that stream and you can see that
[1:33:26] little trout from a thousand feet in the
[1:33:28] air probably not that high and you're
[1:33:30] looking at maybe higher I don't know and
[1:33:31] you look down in there and you look in
[1:33:32] that stream and you can see
[1:33:36] the word down there
[1:33:37] so I gotta have me some of that did you
[1:33:40] know that's what it is when we come
[1:33:41] together we come here and the word of
[1:33:43] God is being preached sometimes
[1:33:44] sometimes it's just me up here rattling
[1:33:47] but you come together because we love
[1:33:49] one another right
[1:33:51] but more importantly we come here
[1:33:53] because we love the word of God
[1:33:55] and we want to be fed
[1:33:57] on the body word of God right that's
[1:34:01] what we come for that's what we need
[1:34:04] we need the Holy Ghost back in our
[1:34:06] services
[1:34:07] right
[1:34:08] we need the Holy Ghost in US
[1:34:11] and I believe
[1:34:13] that if you want it
[1:34:15] you can possess it
[1:34:17] you say well it didn't come the first
[1:34:20] service I come I come expecting and it
[1:34:22] didn't come
[1:34:24] well you sometimes you got to wait a
[1:34:25] while
[1:34:26] sometimes you got to keep coming keep
[1:34:28] going and say you know what I'm going to
[1:34:30] go every service I've been here 10
[1:34:32] services in a row and God didn't move me
[1:34:34] like I wanted him to but you come that
[1:34:36] one time and God does something so
[1:34:38] special for you and you can testify of
[1:34:40] it
[1:34:41] but you have not because you
[1:34:44] right so what do you want I want the
[1:34:47] blessings of God I want healing I want
[1:34:49] my children you can have it because of
[1:34:52] who you are you are in your position so
[1:34:55] take what's yours I hope somebody hears
[1:34:57] me now take what yours in closing I'll
[1:34:59] say this David danced before the Lord
[1:35:01] and when they laughed at him
[1:35:03] oh come on somebody
[1:35:06] but you know what the ark was on its way
[1:35:08] back to where it belonged when you see a
[1:35:10] believer
[1:35:11] see it don't have to be something God's
[1:35:13] doing for me but when I see other
[1:35:15] believers that are being in their
[1:35:16] position and coming back to the Lord
[1:35:18] that does something for me when you see
[1:35:20] some somebody making a decision to be
[1:35:22] baptized that ought to do something for
[1:35:24] the whole church when you see I I don't
[1:35:26] need to pick on you but when I saw
[1:35:27] sister Stephanie come back to the Lord
[1:35:28] it did something for me it lit a fire
[1:35:31] inside of me why because I know God's
[1:35:34] still moving among his people today and
[1:35:36] I can say there's another Seed of
[1:35:38] Abraham who's called out I can see
[1:35:40] brother trips sitting there and
[1:35:41] worshiping the Lord and I can say why
[1:35:43] because God who is rich in Mercy didn't
[1:35:46] want to lose the one of them and he knew
[1:35:47] the Rapture is coming and so why don't
[1:35:49] we just reach out today and say Lord I
[1:35:52] want more of what you got for me and I
[1:35:54] believe he'll pour it out on you tonight
[1:35:55] let's stay under our feet musicians come
[1:36:00] what do we want today
[1:36:02] do you want a promise to be fulfilled in
[1:36:04] your life
[1:36:06] you possess all things
[1:36:09] [Music]
[1:36:10] now who are you
[1:36:12] the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:36:15] and if I could put it this way
[1:36:17] she possesses all things
[1:36:22] how many bride do we have here how many
[1:36:23] believe you're the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:36:25] you possess every promise written in the
[1:36:28] word
[1:36:29] because it wasn't written to the
[1:36:31] unbeliever it was written for you
[1:36:34] it was given to you oh my it was written
[1:36:37] for you
[1:36:39] it's Abraham he said we find out that he
[1:36:41] met him he can go and play something
[1:36:42] there he said we find out that Abraham
[1:36:44] met Melchizedek
[1:36:46] After the Promise had been Vindicated
[1:36:48] then he had Fellowship Melchizedek come
[1:36:50] out to bless Abraham he said Blessed Be
[1:36:52] Abraham blessed be the god of Abraham
[1:36:53] and the possessor of heavens and earth
[1:36:55] he said my how I like that believer's
[1:36:58] promise he said you say what's what's
[1:37:00] that got to do with us to every believer
[1:37:03] the believer's promises eternal life
[1:37:07] listen to this last part the believer's
[1:37:08] promise is life joy peace long-suffering
[1:37:13] gentleness patience fruits of the spirit
[1:37:17] Divine Healing
[1:37:19] isn't all these things that we have just
[1:37:20] by being a believer
[1:37:23] we can't just say it it's got to be from
[1:37:24] the heart
[1:37:26] he said it belongs to you
[1:37:28] but you cannot have it
[1:37:31] until you fight for it
[1:37:33] it may be hard coming to church
[1:37:35] fight your way through that
[1:37:37] it may be hard
[1:37:39] to put God first at times
[1:37:41] but do it
[1:37:43] because your possession is important
[1:37:47] I wonder if we could play something and
[1:37:49] and we could bow our heads and
[1:37:54] program goes on down here
[1:37:56] he said this actual Earth
[1:37:58] he said I'm an heir
[1:37:59] you're an heir
[1:38:01] every believer is an heir
[1:38:04] see he didn't say just the prophet was
[1:38:06] the heir
[1:38:07] every believer
[1:38:09] is an heir
[1:38:12] said you say brother Brandon what about
[1:38:14] what about out there where you can't see
[1:38:16] how how do you know he said it's still
[1:38:18] mine
[1:38:20] he said Heaven belongs to me
[1:38:22] he said I'm glad it's mine
[1:38:24] God said so
[1:38:26] he said that's right well you've never
[1:38:28] seen how do you know it's there he said
[1:38:31] I know it's there anyhow because God
[1:38:33] said so I wonder how many of us could
[1:38:35] say it may not be easy
[1:38:38] but I'm possessing the promise because
[1:38:39] God said I could
[1:38:41] [Music]
[1:38:42] and if he said it that's enough for me
[1:38:46] [Music]
[1:38:48] he said we're all heirs together
[1:38:52] foreign
[1:38:54] [Music]
[1:38:56] why didn't he kill me because he
[1:38:59] couldn't God wasn't ready
[1:39:02] he could come as much as he want to but
[1:39:04] he can't take you
[1:39:06] he said he paid my debt a long time ago
[1:39:10] I paid my debt a long time ago when I
[1:39:12] believed on Jesus Christ who's Alive
[1:39:13] forevermore he said now death listens to
[1:39:16] what we say
[1:39:17] he said you say a possessor of death he
[1:39:20] said that's what Paul said so you're not
[1:39:22] just possessor of all things on here but
[1:39:25] you're a possessor of death itself
[1:39:29] said Paul said fixing to cut his head
[1:39:32] off he said oh death where's your sting
[1:39:35] show me where you can scare me he said
[1:39:37] death said I'll squeeze you down and put
[1:39:40] you in the grave he said you'll rot and
[1:39:41] Canker he said oh thanks be to God who
[1:39:44] gives us the victory through our Lord
[1:39:45] Jesus Christ yes sir death Hell In The
[1:39:47] Grave I possess it all because he
[1:39:50] conquered it all for us the possessor
[1:39:53] [Music]
[1:39:55] you don't have to even die of death
[1:39:58] because a Believer doesn't die
[1:40:01] how many possessors do we have in the
[1:40:02] building today
[1:40:04] I wonder if we could sing this with all
[1:40:05] our hearts
[1:40:06] [Music]
[1:40:08] oh Reach Out
[1:40:10] [Music]
[1:40:17] goes by

[1:41:08] to hear
[1:41:10] your heart's cry oh he time
[1:41:15] passing by this moment
[1:41:19] the Lord needs to
[1:41:22] supply
[1:41:23] just Reach Out
[1:41:26] And Touch the Lord
[1:41:29] as he
[1:41:32] as a clay that I wonder if we could bow
[1:41:34] our heads there's a need among you just
[1:41:37] put your hand up to the Lord
[1:41:39] say Lord I see
[1:41:42] the messages come
[1:41:45] to Abraham's group and he come to me
[1:41:50] he's made me act different walk
[1:41:52] different talk different
[1:41:55] his flesh still battles me but I want to
[1:41:58] overcome more
[1:41:59] what if there's something in somebody's
[1:42:00] heart
[1:42:02] say Lord I want to be a possessor
[1:42:04] I've let things go that I that are mine
[1:42:08] I've let things go that I own
[1:42:12] they're all mine my joy has been
[1:42:14] Stripped Away
[1:42:15] my peace with every head bound now
[1:42:18] a peace
[1:42:20] everything's been taken from me
[1:42:24] I feel like
[1:42:25] that I want my joy restored

[1:42:30] I want my praise restored back to me you
[1:42:32] can possess it today
[1:42:34] my children are out there you can
[1:42:36] possess it today

[1:42:41] possess what's yours
[1:42:44] it is your god-given right
[1:42:46] and it is the believer's authority
[1:42:48] to take what's yours today
[1:42:50] I wonder if you'd pray with me for the
[1:42:52] need that you have and I'll pray for you
[1:42:56] so Heavenly Father
[1:42:59] Lord you see the hands that went up
