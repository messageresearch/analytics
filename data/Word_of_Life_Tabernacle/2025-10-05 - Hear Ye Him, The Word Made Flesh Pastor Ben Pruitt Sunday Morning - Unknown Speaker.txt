So um if you have anything that your kids have left behind or if you've left behind um even if it's somebody else's, I guess you could take it um before the thrift store gets it. Amen. Anybody have a need on your heart this morning? Amen. If you do, just keep your hand up to the Lord as we pray. Brother Jared, would you take the needs of the Lord this morning? [Music] Dear heavenly father, Lord, we come to you this morning, Lord, just thankful that we have another opportunity, Lord, to come into your house with precious people of like faith. Lord, we just come. We just come expecting, Lord, and asking, Lord, that you'll move on a scene for each and every need, each and every heart. Lord, I pray that you would touch every heart. Lord, speak directly to us what we have need of, Lord. You know what what it is, Lord. And you know, even what's unseen, Lord, and we just ask that you'd meet those needs. We ask that you'd touch our elderly people, Lord, here that have made such a sacrifice to be here, Lord. Just pray that you touch them and each and every one, Lord, that's sick. May you touch them also, Lord. May you be with the minister as he comes forward, Lord. And may you just have him speak exactly what we have need of, Lord, and just help them, Lord, and help us all to receive your word. In Jesus Christ's name we pray. Be seated to see. Oh, it's Jesus I really want to see. And more I see of this world, the less it means to me. Glorious Jesus I really want. Sing with all your hearts now. Oh yes Jesus I want to see. Oh, it's Jesus.

Oh, but until the heart will go [Music] in the joy [Music] until the My eyes behold and see [Music] look forward to that day. Sister Ashley, would you play for her? And if you have a song on your heart while you're up here, you're more than welcome to sing, too. That's one way to get her. We're trying to figure out how to ask her in the back because she already said no. But maybe just maybe if the Lord would lead you that way. God bless our singers. Give our singers a nice hand this morning. I feel the touch of hands so kind and tender. They're leading me in paths that I must try. [Music] I'll have no fear for Jesus walks beside me. For I'm sheltered in the arms of God. So let the storms rage high. The dark clouds rise. They won't worry me for I'm sheltered safe within the arms of God. He walks with me and none of earth shall harm me. For I'm sheltered in the arms of God. [Music] Soon I shall hear the call from heaven's portal. Come home my child. This is the last mile you must try. I fall asleep and wake in God's new heaven. sheltered safe within the arms of God. So let the storms rage high, the dark clouds rise, they won't worry me. For I sheltered safe within the arms of God. He walks with me and no to earth shall harm me. For I'm sheltered in the arms of God. So let the stars reach high. the dark clouds. They won't worry me for I shall stay safe within the arms of God. He walks with me and no shall harm me. For I'm sheltered in the arms of God. I'm sh sheltered slave in the arms of God. [Applause] [Music] I left a barren land, searching for rest, stumbling round in amnesia, bitterness and distress. But then I met the kinsman redeemer who's called the mighty one. He took this old Moabitete from the field and brought me to his house. And he said, "Fear not my child, for you are a part of me and I'll not rest till you are at my side. I will do all that you'd [Music] ask of me your jewel in my eyes. Virtuous woman, you are my bride. I've responded to your call and you have covered me. For with eyes of faith I see all the mysteries being revealed. And now I see who I am. And I lay claim to all that's mine. I'm the lamb's wife. I've been bought with a price. And he said, "Fear not, my child, for you are a part of me, and I'll not rest till you are at my side. I will do all that you ask for me. Virtue in my eyes. Virtuous woman, you are my bride. [Music] When I look back and see how much grace and love you've shown me, Lord, it brings me to my knees that you would even think about me. You're still Jehovah Gyra. You're still the greater and with faith I'll stand on your word because you're more than able. He said, "Fear not, my child for you are a part of me and I'll not rest till you are at my side. I will do all that you ask of me. Your virtual in my eyes, virtuous woman, you are my right. And so I'm casting all my cares on you, Lord. I know that you love me. Oh, redemption by the love. That's the greatest love story for restoration, for redemption. That's what seven angels in a cloud testify. My redeemer's no longer dead. He's alive and he's coming back for you. And so I'm casting all my cares on you. [Music] Oh, I know that you love me. [Music] Wo redemption by blood. That's the greatest love story for restoration [Music] for redemption. Last once seven angels in a cloud testify, my redeemer's no longer dead. He's alive and he's coming back for you and me. [Music] enjoy those specials this morning and we know that song God will make the way here but let's stand together. How many's ready for the word of the Lord this morning? How many knows you get what you expect? So this prophet taught us that you get what you expect. If you come looking for something to criticize, you will find something to criticize this morning. If you come looking for something we do wrong, I'm sure we'll find something we've done wrong. But I can tell you this, if you're looking for God to come and move, I know he can come and move in your situation this morning. Are you ready for the word this morning? And then as our pastor comes, God will make a way. God will make a way. Where there seems to be the way, he works in ways we cannot see. He will make a way for me. Oh, he will be my guide. Hold me close to his side with love and strength for each new day. He will make a way. [Music] He will make Oh, sing it again with all your hearts now. I know that God made a way. Yes, he will. Where there seems to be the way, he works in ways we cannot. You believe that this morning we will make a way [Music] with love and strength for each new day. Oh, he will make the way. Oh, he will make a way. If you believe that, let's sing it again. Oh, I know my God will make a way when there seems to be no way. Aren't you glad he's that kind of God? He works in ways we cannot see. Oh, he will make the way for me. Oh, he will be my God. Hold me closely to his side. home with love and strength for each new day. Oh, he will make the way. Oh, he will make it go away. Would you bow your heads with me for a moment? Maybe there's someone who'd like to make a prayer request known by way of uplifted hand. God knows every need. He sees every heart. He knows every family and what you're struggling with. And he knows all about your trouble. But he said, "Come unto me all ye that are weary and heavy laden, and I will give you rest." I believe you can do that this morning. Heavenly Father, we approach your throne today, Lord, believing that you're a great high priest who can be touched by the feeling of our infirmities. Oh God, I pray that you would just move in in a mighty way today. Lord, if there's one here that's unlike you, Lord, in any way, if it's me, oh God, I pray you'd take everything out of me that's unlike you, I pray you'd make us mold us into your image today, God. Lord, if there's a sinner that needs to be saved, I pray that your grace would reach down to them today. If there's a Christian, Lord, maybe not living the right kind of a life and uh some kind of besetting sin. Lord, you're able to remove that from their life today. Lord, maybe there would be a person that's sick and body this morning. Lord, we believe that you're our healer. I pray you would meet that need today. Lord, for these upraised hands, I pray God that you would count that as a sign of surrender today. That you would come, Lord, and meet those needs, Lord. We don't know what they are, but you do. it. So I pray you'd move me out of the way and speak directly to your people. We pray and we pray that you'd grant it now in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. Thank the Lord. Amen. Isn't he good to us this morning? &gt;&gt; Amen. God is good all the time. It's good to have each and every one of you with us. We got most of the folks here this morning. Maybe a few missing, but glad to see you this morning. and I I uh hadn't preached uh in a in a week or two and and uh so good to see everybody. I take my glasses off. I can't see the people in the back, but it's good to have you here too, each one of you. And we just pray the Lord just give us a special blessing this morning. Matthew chapter 17 and verse 1. Matthew chapter 17:es 1-5. got a little bit of a cold today. So, just bear with me. Uh, and then I've got something that I want to to say today. It's on my heart, but I just just try to listen and pay attention this morning if you can and stir up your spiritual conscience this morning and believe the Lord has something he wants to say to us. Matthew chapter 17 verse one. And after six days Jesus taketh Peter, James, and John his brother, and bringeth them up into a high mount mountain apart, and was transfigured before them, and his face did shine as the sun, and his raignment was white as the light. And behold, there appeared unto them Moses and Elias talking with him. And then answered Peter, and said unto Jesus, Lord, it is good for us to be here. If thou wilt, let us make here three tabernacles, one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elias. And while he yet spake, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them. And behold, a voice out of the cloud, which said, "This is my beloved son, in whom I am well pleased. Hear ye him." I'd like to speak this morning on hear ye him the manifested word, the word made flesh. You may be seated. Here ye him, the word made flesh. Who is Jesus? Our attitude toward him is the difference in how we live and how we die. It's the difference in our future and whether we go to heaven or not, whether we live eternally or not. Our attitude toward him is all important. When he was on the earth, uh Jesus actually uh asked his disciples, he said, "Who do men say that I am?" And it may have been the first public opinion poll that Jesus was asking them, "What's the consensus of people about who I am?" them and they said, "Well, there's all kinds of theories about who you are. Some say that you're a prophet. Some say that you're Elijah. Some say that you're a good man. Some say that you're a teacher. Some say you're this, that, or the other." But then he he asked them a more personal question. He said, "Who do you say that I am?" &gt;&gt; And when you ask them that, they begin uh, you know, to maybe look among themselves. And Peter, as he almost always had an answer, right or wrong, but Peter spoke up and he said, he said, "Thou art the Christ, &gt;&gt; the son of the living God." And Jesus looked at him and he said, "Flesh and blood has not revealed this to you." He said, "But my father which is in heaven." So your attitude towards him is the result of a spiritual revelation that he's given to you. As I've told you recently, some people never experience a consciousness of God. They don't know what it's like to come into the presence of God at all. They don't know what it's like to have uh his hand in their life. They never wonder about eternal life. They don't they don't question things. And so, they just go on living their life. But why did you have that question? Why did you wonder who he was? And why did you come to the conclusion that he is the son of the living God? because the father revealed that to you. It had to be a revelation from God or you wouldn't have been here this morning. That ought to give us courage. No matter what else is happening in our life, no matter what else is going on, I the father has given me a revelation. It it belongs to me. I know who he is. &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad you can know who he is this morning? &gt;&gt; It's good to know who the president is and good to know who the senators are and all the political people. It's good to know who your pastor is. It's good to know what church you go to. But the most important thing that you ought to know is who he is this morning. &gt;&gt; That's the allimp important question. Is he a historical figure? Is he a legend or a myth? Is he a good teacher? &gt;&gt; Is he a good luck charm as so many people make him today? Just coffee in Jesus, you know? &gt;&gt; Just something to to have to hold on to when you need him. All right. &gt;&gt; Oh, he is he is he is a good teacher. He is a historical figure, &gt;&gt; but he's also so much more than that. He's God in flesh. &gt;&gt; Is he just a convenience when we need him or is he what he claimed to be the word made flesh? And I want to be very clear about what we're saying when we say that the word made flesh is the Bible walking. &gt;&gt; Right. It's the Bible becoming the words that were written in the Old Testament becoming literal flesh so that when you looked at the Old Testament, you could predict who Jesus was and how he would be born and what he would do and even the manner of how he would do it and everything about it. Now, you couldn't just predict that from uh from a natural mind, but if you had a spiritual insight to see and you begin to see it walk in front of you, it would be revealed to you who Jesus was. To me, he is today the word made flesh. &gt;&gt; Amen. He's still the same God as he was back then. &gt;&gt; We know the entire Old Testament spoke of him. We we see an example in Genesis 12:3. We know he is the blessing to Abraham's seed. He said, "I will bless them that bless thee, and curse him that cursseeth thee, and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed." Peter identifies that scripture fulfilled in Christ in Acts 3:25. He said, "You are the children of the prophets and of the covenant which God made with our father, saying to Abraham, "And in thy seed shall all the kindreds of the earth be blessed unto you first, God, having raised up his son Jesus, sent him to bless you in turning away every one of you from his iniquities." So God fulfilled his word in Christ. I will bless him that blesses you. He fulfilled his word. In thee shall all families of the earth be blessed in literally in Christ. He is Emmanuel born of a virgin in Isaiah chapter 7 and verse 14 if you're writing these down. A prophet Isaiah 400 years before the birth of Jesus or 700 years rather before the birth of Jesus he cried out and said therefore he said the Lord himself shall give you a sign. He said, "Behold, a virgin shall conceive &gt;&gt; and bear a son and shall call his name Emmanuel." &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Emmanuel. What was that? When he was born, he was God. He was Emmanuel. &gt;&gt; He was the woman's seed who crushed the head of the serpent. In Genesis 3:15, he said, "I will put enmity between thee and the woman. Between thy seed and her seed, it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel." That word bruise is to crush. He is the seed of the woman who would crush the head of the serpent on Calvary. He was the teacher of parables prophesied by David in the Psalms in Matthew 13:34. All these things spake Jesus unto the multitude in parables without a parable, speaking not unto them, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying, I will open my mouth in parables. I will utter things which have been kept secret from the foundational world. As we're going through this, I'm not just you say, "Well, I know this, brother Ben, but ought to give you confidence today." If he was exactly the word, then he still is the word today. And whatever he promised in the word is is what you are. If he was the word for his day, and you become the word for your day, then you can be and do whatever the word says you can be and do. And what that does is it releases you from your past. It releases you from your mistakes. It releases you from whatever you were before you come to him because once listen the woman at the well had lived an awful kind of a life. She had five husbands and the one she was living with wasn't she wasn't married to and but he came to her and what did he do once she realized who he was and she said you are the Christ and she said come see a man who told me all that had ever done. What was it? It changed her history because now she could begin to become what the word said she was instead of what the people said she was. She was no longer defined. Oh, come on, church. Defined by what she the way she had lived and the way she had Oh, God. She was no longer defined by what she had been, but she was now. She was now what the word says she was. How could you rejoice in that this morning? I am not a a sum of my mistakes. I am not what I was before I met him, but once I met him, I've become the word made flesh. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Oh, that ought to give you confidence. I know you'll have ups and downs and sometimes you struggle and sometimes you worry and sometimes you think, "Am I really?" But when you met him, you changed. &gt;&gt; And you could not have changed unless that word was going to be made flesh in you. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He is. Oh, what is he to you this morning? Yes, &gt;&gt; he is the one who has spoken of in Isaiah 61. Verse one, the spirit of the Lord God is upon me because the Lord hath anointed me to preach good tidings to the meek. &gt;&gt; He hath sent me to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives and the opening of the prison to them that are bound. Jesus walks up and reads that scripture, that portion of the scripture there in the uh in the synagogue at at Nazareth. He reads the scripture and he sits down and he begin to say unto them, "This day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears." Listen, there's got to come that time for each and every one of us when we walk forward and we say, "The Lord said he would save me and this day this scripture is fulfilled." The Lord said, "I am the God that heals all your diseases and this day this scripture is fulfilled." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, do you believe that's who he is this morning? That's who he is. Hallelujah. Amen. He He is the prophecy, the history, the Psalms. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And if you read the scripture and don't see him, Brother Brandham taught us, read it again. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. When you see him, everything changes. when he was crucified. There were over 28 prophecies fulfilled in a few hours on the cross. He's the rejected lamb of Isaiah 53. The Bible says he was wounded for our transgressions. I believe you can put your name in here. &gt;&gt; He was wounded for my transgressions. &gt;&gt; He was bruised for my iniquities. &gt;&gt; The chastisement of my peace was upon him. With his stripes, I am &gt;&gt; healed. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He was the fulfillment. Aren't you glad he was? &gt;&gt; He's the fulfillment of all the law and the prophets. In Hebrews 10:7, he quotes David saying, "Then said, I lo I come in the volume of the book or in the entirety of the testament, it is written of me to do thy will, oh God." He is the great high priest that can be touched by the feeling of our infirmity. If you have a need today, he is your high priest. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He is your advocate. If you made a mistake, he is the one that you that you say, "Lord, I'm sorry." And he forgives you and his blood covers the sin. Oh, God. Do you believe he is that this morning? He not just was that. He is that. He is the great high priest. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He is the son of man, the son of God, the son of David. The seven compound names of God, which we don't have time to go into all of it this morning, but he is Jehovah and Jehovah Gyra, all of those compound names. He is God our provider. He is God our banner. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He is God our healer. &gt;&gt; Jehovah Rafa. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Colossians chapter 2 and verse 9. For in him, you say, "Well, you're talking an awful lot about him." I don't think there's anything we could talk about and you know more that would give us more ability to understand the Bible than to talk about him because he is the word made flesh. I I don't believe there's anything wrong with talking about Jesus this morning. &gt;&gt; That's what this message come to do was to reveal Christ to us. It wasn't just to make us educated. It wasn't to make us where we know more than we used to know, but to reveal who he is. &gt;&gt; He's the great high priest, the son of man, the son of God. all of these things and in him dwelleth all. Someone say all. &gt;&gt; The fullness of the godhead bodily. &gt;&gt; No wonder the father there on Mount Transfiguration, the that great spirit of God Elohim who existed before the foundation of the world spoke out and said, "Hear ye him." &gt;&gt; Oh my. No wonder he said, "Hear ye him." the word. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hear ye him, the son of man. Hear ye him, the one who came and fulfilled every word and never made a mistake. Never. Oh, God. Who was never never a person who who sinned, who never did anything wrong. You say, "Well, why do we look at him like that? We needed a one like that. We needed somebody because I make mistakes and you make mistakes." And every man that's ever been born of a of of a sexual desire between a man and a woman has made mistakes. Come on, church. Everyone has. But he made he did no sin. Yet he was crucified for your sin and mine. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Paid the debt he did not owe. &gt;&gt; Because I owed a debt. &gt;&gt; I owed a debt that I couldn't pay. Come on now, &gt;&gt; brother Walt. I couldn't pay it, but he paid it. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's for my healing. That's for our salvation. That's for everything that we've ever desired. Aren't you glad for the bill? He paid a debt. &gt;&gt; As these bodies get older and as we get more frail and feeble, some of our elders, I appreciate him being in the house of God this morning. But as you get older and you begin to kind of have to force yourself to do things, your body don't want to cooperate. Remember, he is your healer. He is the provider of a new body. He is the place that you're going to. &gt;&gt; Come on, sir. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; He is the word of God. If the word says they shall not all sleep, but they shall all be changed. He is the word. And if you have him, you'll be a participant in that rapture. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hear ye him, the word &gt;&gt; made flesh. &gt;&gt; What was written and spoken by the prophets made flesh. He is the word. John 1 and1 says, "In the beginning was the word and the word was with God and the word was God." &gt;&gt; The same was in the beginning with God. &gt;&gt; All things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made. So brother Brandham explains this. All that was in God he poured into Christ. The logos the word. &gt;&gt; All that was in Christ he pours into the church. Yeah. &gt;&gt; He said, "All things were made by him." Yes, &gt;&gt; sir. &gt;&gt; Without him was not anything made that was made. In him was life, and the life was the light of men. And the light shineth in darkness, and the darkness comprehended it not. &gt;&gt; If you jump down to verse 14, he talks about John coming the the lesser light to introduce the greater. In John chapter 1 verse14 it says and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory. The glory as of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth. The reason we believe what we believe is not because somebody wrote it but because Jesus became what was written. &gt;&gt; That's a real important distinction. Buddha wrote things and said things. &gt;&gt; Right? Muhammad wrote things and said things. &gt;&gt; Come on, church. But Jesus never left us a book. &gt;&gt; He was the book. &gt;&gt; He didn't Oh, come on. What the prophets wrote over hundreds of years, sir. &gt;&gt; Jesus came and said, "I am he." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He was the book. So, he didn't have to try to be what he was. He just became what he was. And I think that's where many times and I'm just preaching to you this morning trying to get a thought across to you, but many times we get where we struggle and where we get messed up is when we try to make something happen. We we got to try to defend something. We got to try to become something. We got to try to fix ourselves. And you never be able to fix yourself. You need to come to him and say, "Lord, I I'm going to give it all to you. I I believe you're my healer. I believe you're my savior. I believe you can take care of my marriage. I believe you can take care of my children. Come on, church. Has he done it for you? He's He's been a good God. He come and took care of the things that we needed. &gt;&gt; And I'm so grateful for that. &gt;&gt; He's not a God who doesn't care, but he's a God who sees every &gt;&gt; sparrow that falls. &gt;&gt; He saw you. &gt;&gt; Oh, I believe he's here this morning. &gt;&gt; He He saw you go to work. So, you get up early Monday morning. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; You maybe struggle with your car, do whatever it is that you did, and go to work and sit down. You felt so alone because maybe your co-workers don't believe like what you believe. And maybe they don't they say things and do things that aren't maybe exactly what you would do or say. And you feel like a fish out of water. Maybe your body was sick and maybe you struggle with your family and no feel like nobody understands you. &gt;&gt; He saw it. &gt;&gt; See, this is where the word becomes flesh. It becomes real. &gt;&gt; He saw it. &gt;&gt; You struggled. You you questioned. You had a thought about it. Said, "Well, is the message right? Am I even a Christian? Did I even get anything? Do I really have the Holy Ghost?" He saw that. Amen. &gt;&gt; And he called this morning a preacher to come and preach the word to tell you, you are what the Bible says that you are. You are what the word says that you are. You are not what the world says you are. You're not what your job says you are. You might have lost your job, but you can't lose him. You might have You might have lost money, but you can't lose him. You might have done some stupid stuff, but you can't lose him. &gt;&gt; Oh, come on, church. Brother Ryan, you can't lose him. You can't You can't He'll never give up on you. what you got you'll always have. Don't you worry about not about losing him. He'll always You'll always have him. People may not treat you right, but he always will. People may not understand, but he always will. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And the word was made flesh, and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the father, full of grace and truth. Amen. &gt;&gt; In our text, Jesus took Peter, James, and John to the mountain. They saw him speaking with Moses and Elijah, the two greatest Old Testament prophets. Elijah represented justice. Moses represented the law. And Peter looks at that and said, "This is pretty good. I'm going to build a denomination. Fact, let's make two." &gt;&gt; Where there's one, there's always a split, you know. So where wherever there's a first church, there's always a second church. &gt;&gt; I saw the other day this first second church of a certain denomination in Houston, the second church had 20,000 members. I thought, my goodness, what does the first church have? That's why they always wanted, this was the beginning of man's idea. Said, well, let's just make a a tabernacle for each of them. But God wouldn't allow that at that time. Look what happened. While he spake, a bright cloud overshadowed them, and a voice out of the cloud which said, "This is my beloved son." &gt;&gt; In whom I'm well pleased. &gt;&gt; Hear you him. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; See, if you're in Christ, God is pleased with you. &gt;&gt; I hope we understand that today &gt;&gt; because he's pleased with him. &gt;&gt; Right? The pastor may not be pleased with you. Somebody else may not be pleased with you. the church, the deacons, somebody, your wife, your husband. Come on, church. &gt;&gt; They may not be pleased with you this morning, but but God was pleased in the sun. &gt;&gt; And if you are in him before the from before the foundation of the world, he is pleased with you. &gt;&gt; Mark chapter 9:7 says the same thing. There was a cloud that overshadowed them and a voice came out of the cloud saying, "This is my beloved son. Hear him. &gt;&gt; Hear him." Notice what he says. He doesn't say see him &gt;&gt; or even touch him. &gt;&gt; Hear him. &gt;&gt; Why? Cuz he's the word. &gt;&gt; Hear the word. &gt;&gt; I know I'm &gt;&gt; going over and over this this morning, but hear ye him. &gt;&gt; The word, the same word. Hebrews 13:8. Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today, and forever. Amen. &gt;&gt; And this is our contention. And the message of the hour is that Jesus is still the same God today. He He's not different than what he was, but he's the same God. He can do the same things as he did when he walked the shores of Galilee. He's the same and he's been proven to be the same in our day. &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ the same yesterday and today and forever. He's still the word made flesh. Yes. &gt;&gt; The Old Testament speaks of the coming of Christ in a physical body and what he would do and how he would act. &gt;&gt; But the New Testament speaks of his coming in his body, &gt;&gt; the church, which is his bride. &gt;&gt; In Colossians chapter 1, verse 21, let's read down through verse 29. &gt;&gt; You love the word this morning. &gt;&gt; Verse 21. You that were sometime alienated. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Enemies in your mind. &gt;&gt; I love that. enemies in your mind &gt;&gt; by wicked works. &gt;&gt; Yet now hath he reconciled &gt;&gt; in the body of his flesh through death to present you holy and unblameable and unreprovable in his sight. Right? &gt;&gt; If you continue in the faith, listen, and grounded and settled, and be not moved away from the hope of the gospel which you've heard, and which was preached to every creature which is under heaven, whereof I, Paul, am made a minister. He said, who now rejoice in my sufferings for you, and fill up that which is behind of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh, for his body's sake, which is the church. So, he said, I suffer for the sake of the church, not for my own sin. because we cannot suffer for sin. But we we submit ourselves to the will of God for our lives for the church, &gt;&gt; for his body. &gt;&gt; He said, "Whereof I am made a minister according to the dispensation of God which is given to me for you or that portion of understanding of the mystery of God and the will of God given to me for you." He said, "Which is given to me for you to fulfill the word of God, even the mystery which has been hid from ages and from generations." But now, someone say, "Now &gt;&gt; is made manifest to his saints." So Paul is going to tell them something that's been in the mind of God. It's been hidden. It was hidden even from Isaiah and from Jeremiah. But now he's going to tell them something that was hid previously. He said, "The mystery which has been hid, but now it's made manifest to his saints to whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles, which is Christ in you." &gt;&gt; I like that. Christ in you, the hope &gt;&gt; of glory. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Whom we preach, warning every man, and teaching every man in all wisdom, that we may present every man perfect or mature in Christ Jesus, whereinto I also labor, striving according to his working, which workketh in me mightily. Can I say something this morning? To be a Christian, you've got to believe Paul. &gt;&gt; And there's a lot of people want to do away with Paul's teachings today. There's a movement that said, "Well, we just take what Jesus says and not Paul." But to be a Christian, you've got to believe Paul, &gt;&gt; right? His words were scripture. In fact, Peter says Paul, what Paul wrote was scripture. &gt;&gt; So, you've got to believe the Apostle Paul to be a Christian because without the Apostle Paul, you don't even understand what a Christian is or what the church is. Like, you would have no understanding of that without him. So, the mystery of Christ in you was not revealed to John the Baptist. It was not revealed to Apollos. wasn't even revealed to the 11 original disciples, but it was revealed to Paul. All right. &gt;&gt; Ephesians 3:8, he said, "Unto me whom less than the least of all saints is this grace given that I should preach among the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ and to make all men see what is the fellowship of the mystery which from the beginning of the world have been hid in God who created all things by Jesus Christ to the intent that now unto the principalities and powers, excuse me, in heavenly places might be known by the church the manifold wisdom of God. The the the the the many part wisdom of God. Are you with me now? Manifold wisdom according to the eternal purpose which he purposed in Christ Jesus our Lord in whom we have boldness and access with confidence by the faith of him. So Paul is telling us there's a mystery of the church and the church is going to become the very image of God. It's going to become godlike. That's what godliness is. It's going to become the word made flesh again. And so we know that as time went on, if you look at the history of the church, we have a benefit of being able to look at church history, we can see that that image was corrupted by the mystery of iniquity. Go to 2 Thessalonians chapter 2 and verse 7. It says, "For the mystery of iniquity doth already work." So this is right during that first church age, right after Pentecost. Paul is saying the mystery of iniquity was already working. So God had a plan, but Satan also had a plan. And Satan's plan is to thwart God's plan. So the way Satan does that is the same way he did it at the beginning with Adam and Eve. I hope you're following me this morning. So God's going to make sons. &gt;&gt; That's what we're talking about in adoption, right? That's what we're talking about becoming full-born sons and daughters of God. &gt;&gt; Right? God has got a plan to have sons &gt;&gt; and daughters that believe his word, &gt;&gt; that speak his word, &gt;&gt; that are manifested on the earth and able, brother uh brother brother Jaden, they're able to actually control their nature. &gt;&gt; Does that make sense? They they they can speak like he spoke to the storm. They can speak and control the atmospheres in their home, &gt;&gt; the atmosphere at work. Are you with me now? &gt;&gt; So, that was God's plan. And Satan's plan was to thwart that. So what he does is he doesn't come against it. Oh, he he does that as well. But his main thrust is not to kill them and throw them in prison. He tries that and it doesn't work. But his main thrust is to actually deceive them into thinking that they can have more knowledge than what his word says. See, because you can't take away from the word of God. You also can't add to the word of God. And that second one is very important because that's what Satan did. You remember he he he took away part but then he added to and what he did is he when he added to surely you won't die. &gt;&gt; God didn't say that. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? &gt;&gt; So he adds to the the word. I I want to I want us to understand this morning that we don't have a right to do that. &gt;&gt; I can't just preach anything I want to. Right. &gt;&gt; It's got to be in the word. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Just we just don't get to make it up. &gt;&gt; And neither do Christians get to make it up. &gt;&gt; So, well, I don't like what that person does. But is it part of the word? &gt;&gt; Right. You may not like it. That may be your tradition, your way of doing things. But if it's not the word, don't add your interpretation to the word. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Or what you've been taught in the past to the word. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Or your experience to the word. Let's just believe the word. Amen. &gt;&gt; So the image Thank you. Heard a young man saying amen there. &gt;&gt; Either that he was mad at his dad. That image was corrupted by the mystery of iniquity. &gt;&gt; The mystery of iniquity. And he said that already works. Even that first church ages, he said only he who now leth or preventeth he who prevents it will prevent it until he be taken out of the way. Speaking of the Holy Spirit. 1 John 21:18 said, "Little children, it is the last time." If first, if John is writing to that early church and saying it's the last time, we're in the end time of the end time today. &gt;&gt; But he said it's the last time as you have heard that Antichrist should come, shall come, even now are there many antichrists whereby we know that it is the last time. Right? So there were many uh antichrists, many many workers of iniquity, many people who would not stay with the word. They could not become the word because they were not the word from the beginning. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; But they but they created a Satan moved to create among men another religion that looked okay. It looked like the original, but it wasn't the original. And actually what he did is he ate away at what brother Brandham calls the bride tree. If you go listen to restoration of the bride tree, it's a great sermon. But the Brandon preaches that and he says that the tree was eaten away by four messengers of death, deformed by paganism and until it no longer looked like the original. Right. Until now, there's not much deceptive about Catholicism if you read the word. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Right. Because they're nothing like the Bible at all. They've just added wherever they wanted to add, taken away wherever they want to take away. Right? &gt;&gt; And there's not much in deceptive about it at all. Yet there is still deceptive religion. But he he he deformed it by paganism until it no longer looked like the original. And the church no longer fulfilled the commission of Mark 16. Mark 16:15. He said unto them, "Go you into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature." &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; And they substituted that for a forced religion. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Right. to get into politics and and and the inquisitions and and kill people that didn't agree with them. &gt;&gt; But he said, "Preach the gospel." &gt;&gt; He never said, "Force somebody to believe something." He said, "Preach the gospel. &gt;&gt; Those who want to believe will believe &gt;&gt; to every creature. He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved. He that believeth not shall be damned. And these signs shall follow them that believe." &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; In my name shall they cast out devils. &gt;&gt; They shall speak with new tongues. They shall take up serpents. And if they drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them. They shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover. And and yet over time, the church didn't do that at all. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; The entire purpose of the church is in Mark 16. That's what God has commissioned us to do. Over time, they got to where they didn't do it at all. And so, the original purpose was lost. The word could not become flesh in the people because the word wasn't being taught. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Right. How can the word become flesh if the word isn't being heard? Faith comes by hearing and hearing by the word of God. &gt;&gt; So without a pure word, there cannot be a pure faith to manifest that word. But remember, he was the word from the beginning. &gt;&gt; Christ Jesus was the word from the beginning and we become the word. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Now there is a difference. See, we weren't virgin born. &gt;&gt; We were not all of God, the fullness wrapped up in the Godhead bodily, &gt;&gt; right? That's right. &gt;&gt; That's why our words are not infallible. &gt;&gt; We do make mistakes, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; We come into the world speaking lies, &gt;&gt; right? We had to have a nature change. &gt;&gt; So, he was the word from the beginning. &gt;&gt; We become the word. &gt;&gt; Do you understand that? You young people, you're you're not going to be perfect. &gt;&gt; And you need to understand that. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; You need to you need to be you need to understand that. And we want you to live right. We want you to do right. We want you to do better than we did. &gt;&gt; And yet we realize that our children are just little unconverted versions of ourselves. &gt;&gt; Before they get saved, &gt;&gt; right? But we want them to do better than we did. We don't want them to make the same mistakes. But if you make a mistake, if you mess up in some way, you say, "Well, I'm not perfect." Well, nobody is. &gt;&gt; You weren't the word from the beginning. &gt;&gt; You become the word. &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? &gt;&gt; You were in his mind, but you bypassed that word body. Yeah, &gt;&gt; right. It's what he taught us. And who is this MelkiseDC? You bypass your theophony and you come to the world to be tested, &gt;&gt; right? And you, oh, you failed the test many times. I failed the test many times. He never failed, &gt;&gt; but we failed the test many times. But aren't you glad there's one who stands in our place? Aren't you glad? What was it? He wanted to see if you would believe him. He wanted to see if you had the faith to say, "Lord, I know I'm a child of God. I'm a son of daughter of God." So you young people don't get discouraged if you make a mistake. You get right back up. Get back in the house of God and ask God to forgive you and move right on with your life. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Don't sit and dwell on that mistake. &gt;&gt; Satan will use that condemnation to destroy your mind. &gt;&gt; Get up and go. Tomorrow's a new day. If God could forgive Paul of all he did and use him as a messenger of grace, &gt;&gt; hallelujah, &gt;&gt; surely he could forgive me, make me new, and make me go on into the presence of God where I don't do those things no more. &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? &gt;&gt; But how can we become the word if we don't hear it? &gt;&gt; We're becoming the word. And that's what brother Brandham was trying to get to the people. He said the Pentecostals had the Holy Ghost. They thought, "Well, that's it." Yes. &gt;&gt; But no, there's a word coming &gt;&gt; and that has come and we have to become that word. &gt;&gt; How are we going to become that word if we're not hearing it? &gt;&gt; And this is our contention for the message of the hour. If the only message that you hear, if the only uh part of God's prophet's words that you hear is what I'm preaching to you, you're not going to know if what I'm preaching to you is right or not. &gt;&gt; You've got to hear it. You got to hear it. &gt;&gt; I'm not trying to There's no no uh structure to that order to it. I don't tell you listen to a certain tape at a certain time. What do we tell you? You got to hear it. &gt;&gt; If the Holy Ghost is in you, it wants to feed on the word. Don't you want to feed on the word of God this morning? Don't you want it to be a part of who you are? Don't you want Don't you want to become that word? Say, "Lord, I need more victory in my life." Feed on the word of God. &gt;&gt; Read your Bible and pray. Yeah. &gt;&gt; You want to be a better Christian? Read your Bible and communicate with the author. Read your Bible. Listen to the message of the hour. Become the word. How can you become the word when you don't hear it? &gt;&gt; So just because you say, "Well, I'm saved. I've been filled with the Holy Ghost." But you need to become everything that God meant for you to be. &gt;&gt; And in doing that, we receive in this age our adoption, the change of our bodies. &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad for that? Listen, he was God's masterpiece. &gt;&gt; So God had prophets. He had prophets over time and but here come here come the God prophet. &gt;&gt; He was God's perfect image. And and brother Brandham tells the story and you all know it how that when Michelangelo was making the statue of Moses that he stood there and here he made such a lifelike what what he had in his mind became so lifelike before him. It was so perfect to what was in his mind. He He was inspired and he took his hammer and he struck it on the knee and he said, "Speak." &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; But it couldn't speak cuz it was made out of marbles. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Oh, God. &gt;&gt; He smoked it. It said, "Speak." But it could not speak. &gt;&gt; What are we preaching on this morning? Hear ye him. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; But God took his son. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Can we say it that way? his masterpiece. &gt;&gt; He hung on a cross. &gt;&gt; He smoked him. &gt;&gt; And when he did, he cried, "Speak." &gt;&gt; And the masterpiece said, "It's finished." &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But he didn't just have a masterpiece groom, if we could say it that way. A masterpiece in his mind of Son of Man. See, if Jesus was all that God wanted, he would have never had to have died. &gt;&gt; But God wanted you to be part of his program. He wanted me to be part of his program. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He'd be the firstborn of how many? Many sons. &gt;&gt; The firstborn among many brethren. And so he wanted us to be a part. Oh, come on, church. To be a part of what he what he is in his plan. He didn't just want us to be. He predestinated us to be. He fordained us to be. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And so in doing that, he has also made a masterpiece down through seven church ages. And finally, he got the bride where he wanted to get her. And what is the bride to do? The bride when he when he when he smites the bride, when she is rejected from denomination, when she's rejected from her people, when the world don't understand her, come on, church. When she's persecuted and afflicted, &gt;&gt; she is smitten. The smitten bride. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And she speaks. Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, church, this is where we're coming to the maturity to speak. Remember I told you that a child when it says a child is is though he's an heir, he's no different from a slave, that word child means someone who does not speak. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Oh, God. &gt;&gt; In order. But what did God say when he when he when he come and he anointed his son? He come down and and he said, "This is my beloved son." What what was he saying? It was an adoption ceremony. He said, "Hear him." &gt;&gt; He speaks. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; That's where the bride has to come to. &gt;&gt; We hear a voice coming down from the cloud saying, "This is my beloved son. Hear you him." Brother Brandon said, "If they're going to hear, he's got to speak." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. just a few days before he was smitten. This is my son whom I'm pleased to dwell in. I have molded him. &gt;&gt; I've been 4,000 years bringing him to this. And now he is so perfect. I've got to smite him so he can speak. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hear ye him. He is the perfected one. &gt;&gt; Oh, I can't drive that home enough, church. &gt;&gt; Hear ye him. Quit listening to the voice of Facebook. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; Quit listening to the voice of Tik Tok. Quit listening to I'm not telling you you can't have those things. I'm saying quit listening to it. Quit letting it define who you are. &gt;&gt; Quit listening to your to your neighbor. Quit listening to others that are around. Quit listening to your family member say you don't look like you used to and and you ought to go do this or do that. Quit listening to them old friends back in that old lifestyle. Hear ye him. &gt;&gt; Hear ye him who can change your life. Hear ye him who can make you new. Hear ye him who's your healer. Hear ye him who is the word made flesh. Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Good. &gt;&gt; He wants to speak to you today. &gt;&gt; He doesn't just want to speak to you. He wants to speak through you. &gt;&gt; They did not understand that the scripture must be fulfilled. &gt;&gt; And so they didn't understand why he was smitten. &gt;&gt; And we we find even the two men on the road to Emmas, remember they were sad. &gt;&gt; Why were they sad? Well, they gave because they didn't understand. And this is where people fall into this spirit of depression in our day. &gt;&gt; Right? You need to hear him. &gt;&gt; They were sad. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Cuz they had no they weren't listening to him. &gt;&gt; They were even hearing him and not listening to him. &gt;&gt; So they were walking with him along the way. &gt;&gt; And as they walked with him from from Jerusalem to Emmas, here he comes. He begins to talk to him. He said, "Why are you so sad? &gt;&gt; Why do you have so much anxiety? Why are you so worried? Come on. &gt;&gt; They said they said, "Have you not heard what's happened?" &gt;&gt; And when they told him, &gt;&gt; he said, "All fools, &gt;&gt; slow of heart &gt;&gt; to believe all that the prophets spoke." &gt;&gt; I hope this is okay this morning. &gt;&gt; Is all that the prophet spoke? What did the prophet speak? They spoke of him. &gt;&gt; He was the word made flesh. So he said, "Oh fools and soul of heart to believe all that the prophets had spoken." He began to go through the scripture. I'd have liked to been part of that sermon. &gt;&gt; That that six-hour sermon I believe was going back to Emmas and as he talked with them along the way, they begin to something in their hearts begin to grab a hold of what he was saying, but they didn't realize who he was. &gt;&gt; See, you can't really listen to him like you should until you know who he is. &gt;&gt; But when he Oh, church, it's a perfect time for this day. When he come back to their house, he he did something that he had done before. Right. Right. &gt;&gt; He did something in his resurrected body that he had done in his natural body. What happened in our age? A prophet stood and did something that Jesus did when he was here. It didn't make the man Jesus. What did it do? Hallelujah. What did it do? It proved to us that he was speaking and we better listen to what he said. And so when he did something he had done before, what did they do? They said, "Did not our hearts burn within us as he talked to us along the way? Wasn't the word good?" See if you realize he is here then you realize the importance of the word. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hebrews 11 or 1:1 rather. God who at sunundry times and in diverse manners spake in time past unto the fathers by the prophets &gt;&gt; hath in these last days spoken unto us by his son. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Whom he hath appointed heir of all things &gt;&gt; by whom also he made the worlds. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; All right church. just a little deep, but I hope we can understand it this morning. Kind of grab a hold of the concept. It's why he had to return a son of man. &gt;&gt; Yeah, &gt;&gt; he had to speak. &gt;&gt; Yes, &gt;&gt; I hope we get that and don't confuse that with the man &gt;&gt; because brother Brandham was not the son of man. He was a son of man revealing the son of man. But the son of man had to speak. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Look, he said he's he's spoken unto us by the son of being the brightness of his glory, the express image of his person, and upholding all things by the word of his power. When he had by himself purged our sins, sat down on the right hand of the majesty on high, being made so much better than the angels, as he hath by inheritance obtained a more excellent name than they. Look, church, when he was born, a baby in a manger, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; He was the word made flesh. &gt;&gt; That's what the Bible says. is Emanuel, God with us. &gt;&gt; Right? He was the word made flesh that said, "A virgin shall conceive." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He was the interpretation of the written word. Listen, he didn't come as a general with armies. &gt;&gt; He didn't come as a king with subjects. &gt;&gt; He come as a baby &gt;&gt; in a manger. &gt;&gt; And the people didn't recognize it, but the shepherds did. Yes. &gt;&gt; And they said they said, "This is him." And they worshiped him. And the and the magi worshiped him and the different ones, but the majority could not see that God had become flesh. The word had been made flesh. But but but I'm so glad that I saw it. I'm so glad he revealed himself to me. Aren't you glad he revealed himself to you? &gt;&gt; You were like those shepherds that were out there and you didn't know anything, but God spoke to you at a supernatural experience to reveal himself to you. And he he said, "Here is the word made flesh. &gt;&gt; Hear ye him." &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Hear ye him. He has spoken. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But the church through the corruption of creed and dogma no longer hear his voice. &gt;&gt; He spoke in this gentile age through Paul and through the other writers of the New Testament. But there had to come a people who would become the manifestation of the book, &gt;&gt; the New Testament. &gt;&gt; Right? As the old the the seals of the Old Testament were were broken in Christ. The seals of the New Testament, we could put it that way, were broken in in were broken in the at the time for the emerging of the bride, &gt;&gt; right? The bride, an infant bride coming on the earth. So, the word had been veiled by denomination and creeds for 2,000 years, but it had to be preached in purity. Again, I know this is you say, "Well, this is so complicated, Brother Ben," but it's not really. It's it's simplicity. &gt;&gt; You had to become what God saw in his mind before we leave the earth. &gt;&gt; And God did it the way he's always done it. He come and spoke through a prophet, &gt;&gt; revealed himself to a generation, said, "I'm the same yesterday, today, and forever." And made us ready. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It's really simple, &gt;&gt; sir. &gt;&gt; But the word had been veiled for 2,000 years. And those men that died and preached, they preached a portion of the word, but they died in that and died in faith. But they without us cannot be made perfect, the scripture says. So the church had to be restored back the years that those four messengers of death, Joel 2:25, I will restore to you the years, the locust, defeating the cankworm, the caterpillar, the palmer worm, my great army which I sent among you. How would he restore? Well, I'd ask you to go back and read in Ezekiel about the valley of dry bones. &gt;&gt; How many have ever read that? &gt;&gt; The valley of dry bones. If you go read that, what does he say? You know, God doesn't say, "Ezekiel, I'm going to stand you here and then you look and see what I do." &gt;&gt; That's not what he did. He told Ezekiel the prophet, he said, "Prophesy to those bones." &gt;&gt; He said, "Ezekiel, can these bones live?" &gt;&gt; And Ezekiel said, "Lord, you know." &gt;&gt; Huh? Look at the humility of the prophet. He didn't say, "Well, I know it all." He said, "You know, Lord." Because the prophet only knows what's revealed to him. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Right. But he said, "Lord, you know, &gt;&gt; and he said, "Prophesy to the bones." And the bones started to come together. And he said, "Prophesy again." And he said, "The wind, the breath of God blew into those bodies and they become a mighty army." How would he restore? By the voice of a prophet, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; That's how he would restore. &gt;&gt; That's why we're different. It's why we do what we do. &gt;&gt; Because God spoke in our day. And and so we know God would use a prophet's lips to speak the word of restoration to restore our churches, to restore our families, &gt;&gt; to restore us as individuals &gt;&gt; in a world that used us and abused us and come on church. &gt;&gt; World full of drugs and sex and iniquity and church. World full of whatever they want to do, they do. A world that's gone crazy. A world that's left the word of God. But he said, "I will restore, sayeth the Lord." &gt;&gt; And it wouldn't be for everybody, but it would be for those who were who were to be alive at the time of his coming and awake and ready for that time. Oh, the his predestined bride. &gt;&gt; The book had to be sealed till the time for the fullness to come. Are you still with me? I've got just a few more minutes and we'll close. &gt;&gt; I promise I won't preach as long as brother Stewart did. &gt;&gt; I better not promise that. I don't know how long he preached. Daniel 12:4 But thou, oh Daniel, shut up the words and seal the book, &gt;&gt; even to the time of the end. &gt;&gt; Where are we living, church? &gt;&gt; Many shall run to and fro, and knowledge shall be increased. &gt;&gt; Revelation 10:7, but in the days, &gt;&gt; of the voice, hallelujah, of the seventh angel, when he shall begin to sound, the mystery of God should be finished, as he had declared to his servants the prophet. What are we telling you in this? We're not telling you hear a prophet. We're telling you hear the word. &gt;&gt; Hear ye him. &gt;&gt; Hear Christ the word. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hey, excuse me for screaming at you. I don't mean to do that. &gt;&gt; But in the days of the voice, the mystery of God should be finished to get declared to his servants. The prophets were living in that time. In John 14:20, Jesus said, "At that day," &gt;&gt; that's this day, "you shall know that I am in my father, &gt;&gt; ye in me, and I in you." &gt;&gt; This is the hour of adoption, if we can say it that way. This is the hour of the fullness. This is the hour of the opening of the word. This is Oh, this is the hour of of the bride masterpiece. This is the hour. Oh, this is the hour when we're going home. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; So, he has formed another masterpiece, a body to dwell in. Listen, brother Brandham said, "The great sculptor is counting on you." &gt;&gt; Listen, brother Brandham came and did his part, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And we we we love it, don't we? &gt;&gt; But that but he's not counting on brother Brandham, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; He's counting on you. &gt;&gt; Willing to stand and have yourself shaped into the likeness of his requirement that his word requires. &gt;&gt; So you can do one of two things. You can you can rebel against him. You can turn your back on it. You can walk away from it and you can say, "I'm just going to do what's good for me and my family." Or you can say, "Lord, I believe I'm part of that bride. Lord, make me what you want me to be. Sculpt me into your image, Lord. Let your word cut away every part that's unlike you. Let me be a real son or daughter of God." &gt;&gt; The great sculptor is counting on you, willing to stand and have yourself shaped into the likenesses of his requirement that his word requires. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. In the last days, I'll pour out my spirit upon all flesh. Your sons and daughters shall prophesy. He said Christ is the identified masterpiece of the world made word made flesh. You are asked to identify yourself in him by the same word to be the masterpiece for the bride. &gt;&gt; He said now brethren, God had a masterpiece then to present to the world. Now he wants a masterpiece today. Listen church, are you willing? &gt;&gt; I know you've heard a lot. It's a lot to take in. But are you willing? &gt;&gt; Are you ready, &gt;&gt; my Christian friend? Are you really sure that your life is so reflecting for Christ? No matter what the world says, they say you lost your mind. You gone crazy. You went join that bunch of holy rollers. Don't you pay no attention to that. &gt;&gt; If you're not truly saved, he's in that body and the word of God in you and reflecting itself and the life of Christ reflecting out of you. Brother, sister, don't you take that chance. I don't care what you are, what kind of experience you have. Let that word reflect through you each day &gt;&gt; because God in this last day is taking a bride for his son, Jesus Christ. Yes. &gt;&gt; So again, it's very simple. Lord, help me to become what you wrote. &gt;&gt; God, &gt;&gt; in flesh again, &gt;&gt; in the portion of the bride that I can fulfill. Hallelujah. If Isaiah and the other prophets, now listen, had spoken, this is important. If they had spoken but he never came then their word would have been no different than Buddha's word. &gt;&gt; It been no different than Muhammad's word &gt;&gt; if he had never came. He came. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And he spoke. And he didn't just speak the word they spoke. He was the word &gt;&gt; that they spoke. In fact, when he was standing there on trial, he didn't stand there and say, "I am the word." &gt;&gt; Haven't you read Psalm 22? Haven't you read all these scriptures? &gt;&gt; See, we think we got to defend ourselves &gt;&gt; or even defend the message. Let your life defend the message. &gt;&gt; Jesus stood there and said like a a lamb before the shears, he was he he didn't open his mouth, &gt;&gt; right? He stood there and he and they accused him of all kinds of things. They said, "Don't you have anything to say?" Oh my. But he stood there quietly. Why? He was the word. &gt;&gt; The very fact that they were accusing him was fulfilling the word. &gt;&gt; The fact that he would be nailed to a tree was fulfilling the word. &gt;&gt; The fact that he would suffer the pain, all it was fulfilling the word. And he had perfectly resigned himself. Not my will, Lord, but thine be done to the will of God for the day and hour that he lived in. Hope we can only get a people today who say, "Lord, not my will, but thine be done." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's got to come by revelation. You can be raised in the message and but if you never have a revelation of it, you'll try to take every shortcut, try to get out of it. But our sister told her testimony the other day. How did she come? And she began to hear the word and and and she began to do things and then suddenly suddenly that something hit her when she was hearing some people speak about why they dressed the way they did. It hit her. She said, "I want to be like that. I want to dress like something come in your heart. Something's got to come in your heart. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; He came and he spoke and he was the word that they he was the word the prophet spoke. So Jesus was the vindication of the prophet's word. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Let me let me go a little bit further. If the prophet only spoke in this age &gt;&gt; and we never came &gt;&gt; then the prophet would have failed. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Listen. &gt;&gt; I love this message. But if the messenger talked about a pastor in a church preaching over the pulpit and and he talked about that and the Bible teaches that and he talks about that then if I don't do what he said &gt;&gt; then the prophet failed &gt;&gt; no matter how much we love what he said &gt;&gt; right there had to be a manif manifestation of it &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; hear ye him Yes. &gt;&gt; The word made flesh. &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? &gt;&gt; We want to hear the message. We want to do the message. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Listen. If if a if if a woman never dressed right and act right, if a man never treated his family right. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Then what good did a prophet's message do? &gt;&gt; Right. If we weren't a witness in our community, I know there's been many who weren't. &gt;&gt; But let me be one who is. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Let me be one who's loving and kind and patient and longsuffering and lives for other people. &gt;&gt; Let me be one. &gt;&gt; Oh, church. Everybody wants to be the word and say, "Well, I'll heal the sick and raise the dead." But do you want to be the word when you got to keep your mouth shut? Do you want to be the word when you got to live for him in every part of your life? That's right. &gt;&gt; Everybody wants to be Jesus on the mountain when the glory of God come on him. But who wants to be Jesus at the cross? &gt;&gt; And his prophecy is vindicated when the bride speaks. &gt;&gt; When the bride lives. &gt;&gt; Just as God took Jesus to the mountain to say, "This is my adopted son." What did he say? He speaks for me. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Right. He speaks for me. So the bride must be taken by the message of this hour. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And can I say it like this? To Sunset Mountain. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Right. We had to be taken to Mount Sunset to have him declare through the opening of the word. Listen, I didn't have to go there myself. I believe what a prophet said about it. I believe what happened. I believe what the picture that we saw that was taken of it. I believe that God supernaturally did that. People can say what they want to. I believe. &gt;&gt; And because I believe, what is it? I believe that now I've been taken to Mount Sunset to have him declare through the opening of the word. Listen, he wasn't telling us just who a prophet was. He was saying, "This is my bride. &gt;&gt; Hear ye him." &gt;&gt; The same God that spoke through Jesus and the prophets, the same God that spoke through William Brandom, that same God wants to speak through your lips and mine. Amen. &gt;&gt; Say, "This is my beloved bride. She speaks for me." &gt;&gt; Now, you you can believe what you want to about that. I believe that we are living in that time. &gt;&gt; We just got to participate in it. &gt;&gt; I don't believe we're waiting on another messenger to come &gt;&gt; to bring us to our Mount Transfiguration. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I believe that happened. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Our adoption is this message. Its vindication is our vindication, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And our life is the vindication of the message, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; We are the word made flesh. I, brother Brandon, Sister Charity are here. I don't mean to single y'all out, but they told me a story about seven years ago about their daughter. Hope it's okay about their daughter who was healed who was they thought she was dead. She was laying there without any response in the hospital and a little sister from a message church heard a prayer request that was given and she went and showed up at the hospital and she laid her hands on the baby. Graceland is here this morning. laid her hands on the baby and and prayed prayed with them and and when they did what happened, the baby was healed &gt;&gt; because she's here today with no no effects of that. &gt;&gt; It's a wonderful testimony. They'll tell it to you sometime. But it think about this and as I was thinking about this sermon I thought that's was God &gt;&gt; living in the flesh of somebody &gt;&gt; who just listened to that voice that said go and pray in another city for a family you've never met for pe somebody you maybe never would meet but go and pray &gt;&gt; lay your hands on some God don't want to just speak through a prophet he wants to speak through his bride &gt;&gt; he don't want to just speak through a pastor he wants to speak through his bride &gt;&gt; brother Brandham talked about a woman, a little child that was healed because of because a woman, he said, "Lay his hands laid her hands over on the baby and she was healed." And brother Brandon was there and that baby went through the prayer line. But when it finally went through the prayer line, he said, "It's already healed." Because that lady, that sister laid her hands on it. &gt;&gt; What was it? God working through his body. These are his hands. This is his mouth. Same with you. If you're a part of the body of Christ, &gt;&gt; so we want to become that word. And I say, "Lord, let me lay down my thoughts." &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; My desires, &gt;&gt; "Let me be a help." Huh? &gt;&gt; And years later, it might make a difference. &gt;&gt; That person you prayed for may have been healed and you never knew it. &gt;&gt; Excuse me for being emotional this morning, but I'm closing in just a moment. But but I I can think back over years of preaching and I started preaching when I was very young. I remember as a teenager preaching the gospel. Some of the people that I baptized and some of the people we worked with at Bransville, Brother JT and some of the folks that I worked with even before that over at over at Galia and over in there and and and I worked with those people in Mountain Home and I can remember Texar Cana. I worked with some of them baptized, some of them, prayed for some of them. I don't know where they're at today, but I know my God's a big God and his word will not go out void. And if I just do what God called me to do, he'll do what he promised he would do. And I believe what we have today is a fruit of God working in his body. Not in me only, but in the body, the entire body of Christ. He's working through each and every one of you to fulfill his word. Every one of you matter. You say, "Well, you you don't understand what I've been through my past and all those things." It doesn't matter. You're a part of the body of Christ. You matter when you're in the house of God because it might be the time for you to speak. &gt;&gt; This is my beloved bride. Hear ye her. &gt;&gt; The br said, "The same word spoke of the groom speaks of the bride." Well, how can the bride come and fail to manifest everything? Someone say everything. It was promised of him and the groom come. He wouldn't be the bride. when he did everything even to proving it by raising himself up from the dead afterwards then don't the bride have to do the same thing have to be exactly what the word said she would be in these last days don't she hallelujah don't she have to return listen he never said he would come back he said she had to return &gt;&gt; glory to God don't she have to return through Malachi 4 don't she have to be manifested like it was in the days of Sodom don't the world have to be just exactly like it isn't these things, a perfect identification of the word of God made known to us. &gt;&gt; How can we do it? You said, "Brother Ben, how can I be the word made made flesh?" We got to be as sure of the scripture spoken about us as he was about himself. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Listen, he was so sure of Psalm 16:10. It said, "Thou will not leave my soul in hell. Neither wil thou suffer unholy one to see corruption." Jesus took that scripture and he said, "That's me." &gt;&gt; Right? He believed his own word. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Jesus knew that was he. no question in his mind. And he knew that 72 hours the body corrupts &gt;&gt; and and he and he was going to come back to life again. So he said, "You destroy this temple. I'll raise it again in three days." Why? The word was written of him. It was written of him because he was the manifestation of God's written word for that day. Can you have that much confidence this morning? He is the God who heals all my diseases. He's the God who saves my children. When he said, "Thou thy house shall be saved." He's the God who brings me peace. He said he bring me peace beyond understanding &gt;&gt; that passes understanding. &gt;&gt; He said, "Well, there's got to be." Hallelujah. There's got to be, brother. Somewhere God's manifested word of God today. That's the same thing for he spoke of these days. He said, "What would take place in these days?" He has already told us. We know what's going to take place and we see it being manifested in you. &gt;&gt; Huh? Do you ever think about it like that? &gt;&gt; Yeah. Good. &gt;&gt; We see it being manifested in you that you're in God's church. &gt;&gt; Don't sell yourself short this morning, church. &gt;&gt; See, every time you come to church, you're the fulfillment of Hebrews 10:25. &gt;&gt; Don't forsake the assembling of yourselves together. How could something that's against that be the word of God? &gt;&gt; It can't. Every time you lay hands on the sick, you're the fulfillment of Mark 16. How could someone who says we don't believe in healing anymore? &gt;&gt; You're the fulfillment of Mark 16:18. Every time you lay hands on the sick, &gt;&gt; ladies, you become the fulfillment of 1 Timothy 2:9. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Oh, I see it this morning. Come on, church. &gt;&gt; The fulfillment of 1 Timothy 2:9 talks about modesty and dress and things like that. Men and women become the fulfillment of Titus chapter 2 when he talks about how a man should act and how a young man should act and how how a woman should act, how a young woman should act. Every time he comes and heals us. Has he come and healed you many times? Every time he comes and something good happens. &gt;&gt; We are manifesting his word for today. I would cry out to you today. You are the word made flesh. Speak and go forward. &gt;&gt; He told Moses there at the at the the Red Sea. He said, "Don't cry. Speak &gt;&gt; and go forward." He's taken you up on the mountain and said, "Speak for me." Hallelujah. Here you hear my son or daughter in the word age of life manifested the voice of many waters. He talks about in revelation. Listen brother Brandon said those in the bride do only his will. No one can make them do otherwise. They have thus sayeth the Lord or they keep still. They know that it has to be God in them doing the works. Fulfilling his own word. Musicians go ahead and come or I'll never quit. He did not complete all this work while in this earthly ministry. So now he works in and through the bride. You believe that today? &gt;&gt; She knows that. For it was not yet time for him to do certain things that he must now do. But he will now, someone say now, fulfill through the bride, that work which he left for this specific time. There's a work for you to do. There's somebody for you to lay hands on. There's somebody for you to speak the word over. There's somebody. He put you in your family, brother Paul, for a reason. You may not see the results of it even while you're living, but someday there's going to be a result. Why? He promised you your family. Are you with me now, church? Someday the bride is there's going to be a manifestation of the word. the bride speaks. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. There come a day organization, as I'm kind of skipping through these last quotes, the organization could no longer speak for God. They made dogmas and creeds and not simple word, but God sent Wesley and he was the voice with the word in his day. But when the Methodists failed, God raised up others. And so it has gone on through the years until in this last day. There is again another people in the land who are under their final messenger will be the final voice to the final age. When I am identified with the word I'm identified with him the head who came down to the body the authority that came to the body. I'm identified with the bridegroom. Hallelujah. [Music] If we go down to that last quote, we're not looking at a future event. Brother Brandham ties that in Mount Transfiguration. He ties that to the opening of the words, opening of the seals in the Easter Seal 1965. And but he said not just a future event. He said now. Someone say now. in our bodies speaking with new tongues with prophesying for seeing laying hands on the sick recover the world dead and all the things of the world we passed from death to life we now hold the power hear ye him I want to tell you this morning if you've never if you've never come to that life that change that that that glorification if you will that moment of when his spirit comes in you and the token begins to be on display in your life. Hear him. Hear you him. The word made flesh. That's the thunder that shakes the devil. A life lived according to the word. A mature word born son or daughter. His son in the word age. His daughter in the word age quickened by the spirit like a spark that lit off of something to make it alive. Seated now in heavenly places in present tense already alive and made subject to every promise in the word. If I want to finish like we started, what is your attitude towards Jesus? Is he the same yesterday, today, and forever? What is your attitude towards the message today? Is it a historical thing? Is it just something that brother Brandham did? It's good. We can listen to it. What is the attitude? Or is it Christ? Oh, church. Is it some kind of religion like the Mormons or the Jehovah's Witnesses? Or is it Christ? &gt;&gt; Oh, I believe with all my heart it's Christ cuz it did not just write a book. He he he lived it. I'm so glad that God didn't just send us a a voice out of the heavens, but he sent a voice and a prophet so that I could see that he did not just preach, but he lived what he preached. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; And God didn't want just a people to hear it, but he wanted a people to manifest it. God didn't send a prophet for a prophet's sake, but he sent a prophet said, "Behold, I send you." Who was the you? It was me. That you was me. Behold, I send you, Elijah the prophet, before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the Lord. Hallelujah. I've taken that as me. He shall restore the heart of the children back to the Pentecostal fathers. My heart has been turned. So, I'm a vindication. Hallelujah. You're a vindication of God working in his body. Do you believe it this morning? Amen. Let's do something a little bit different this stand together. I want you to lay hands on one another. You're the body of Christ. The body of Christ. Lay hands on somebody beside you there. Oh, church. Maybe your husband or your wife or a loved one, a mother, an aged mother. Some of y'all sitting in the back. I see you there. our elders. I see some that have been struggling in body. I see some struggling in spirit. He is our Jehovah Gyra. He wants to speak through his body today. He wants to speak through his body. And we are the word made flesh. We are the message of the hours. They said, "Where is the Welsh revival?" And the man said, "I am the Welsh revival. We are the word made flesh. Hear you him this morning. Would you just pray for the person, not for yourself, but for the person you got your hands on, the people that you got your hands on. I pray for every one of you. We just believe that the Holy Spirit will begin to move in the bride body. If there's a need this morning, I believe he's going to meet it right now. And we can go rejoicing believing that God keeps his word. Heavenly Father, Lord, you you said, Lord, that they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover. Lord, that there's a sick one among us. Lord, hands are being laid on them. Not my hands, but the hands of your people. I pray, God, right now that you'd heal these sick people, oh God. I pray you'd bless these musicians, Lord. I pray you'd strengthen them, Lord. I pray you'd move for for our elders. I pray you'd strengthen their bodies. I pray for our young families, Lord, who face so much temptation and struggle in the world. I pray you'd protect our children. I pray you'd protect our young people, protect our families, Lord. Let that dad that goes to work, Lord, you see where he goes. that mom maybe that struggles that single mother or that's struggling so much. Oh God, I pray you'd reach down, heal them, Lord, touch their minds and their bodies. I pray you'd work right now in their midst. Oh God, I pray you'd do it now. Lord, we believe you today. You said the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availth much. I'm not righteous in myself. These people are not righteous in theirelves, but Lord, they are the body of Christ have been washed by the blood of the lamb, by the bleeding word. I pray God that we would speak today and every mountain would be moved. We pray in Jesus name. Amen. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Oh, if you believe it's done, it's not about how we feel, but it's about what we believe. Let's just raise our hands to him and let and believe it now. Oh, I believe, Lord, that you met my need. I believe God that you heard my prayer. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Oh, use me Lord. Help me to become your hands and your feet, oh God. We pray in Jesus name. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. If you need special prayer, the altar's open today. We love you in the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, thank you, Lord Jesus. Let's just worship him a minute before we go now. Hallelujah. Oh, and even though it's humble. Oh, I thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; Lord, help my will to crumble, oh, and though the cost be great, I work for you. Sing the chorus again with all your heart now. Oh, make it your prayer, church. Won't you Jesus use me? Use me Lord. Help me to be the manifested word of God. Hallelujah.
