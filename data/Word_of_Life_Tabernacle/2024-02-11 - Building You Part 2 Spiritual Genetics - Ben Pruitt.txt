this morning amen amen let's sing that song if we could you are my refuge I was I was looking you see me get on my phone there I was trying to find this quote that I read the other day and I didn't want to misquote it but it was um it says uh true true greatness requires responsibility and so you know I was thinking about that this morning when I was I was running really really late this morning by the way and it was kind of my fault I told Jen I was like let's sit on the couch 10 more minutes and have our coffee and just kind of ease into the day you know and so you know then I got running behind and then I was kind of uh kind of in the back just rushing around real quick and you know I kind of that quote came kind of came back to me I was like you know if if I'm going to have a good service today you know it's my responsibility you know if if I want a great service it's my responsibility and so you know when you're worshiping you're not worshiping the song leader or the preacher but you're you're worshiping to him so if you want to have a great service it's it's really on you and we can do we can do as much as we want and I can try as hard as I can the musicians can play great but really it comes back to us how good of a service do we want to have and so if you want to have a good service this morning guess what nothing stopping you but you amen so so we can't blame the pastor unfortunately we can't blame brother Ben so let's sing this song do you know this one sister Anna you are my refuge you are my [Applause] Sanu when I feel afraid you're my Hiding Place you

prophet in our day we're so thankful for that today we're so thankful for the guidance of the Holy Spirit Lord that you've come and live in each one of us individually to lead us and to guide us Lord thankful for that today Lord we thank you for this church Lord I I know there's many needs represented I I pray that you just meet every need this morning Lord whether it's healing or salvation Lord physical or material I pray you'd meet those needs today move me out of the way Lord reduce the Lord the the error of My Flesh and Lord the my inability oh God or may I go down to nothing Lord and may your word be elevated today we ask and we pray we believe it in the precious name of Jesus amen amen amen would you love him today it good to be in the house of the Lord on a Sunday morning just be able to rejoice in the word of the Lord amen I just want you to enter in with me this morning I want to continue on the thought that we began Wednesday night um that's a little bit different I don't usually do that but you can go back and listen if you weren't here on Wednesday but I just want to continue on that thought and talk about how God builds us as individuals God builds us as individuals he's not just interested in us as a church but he's interested in us as individuals do you believe that he he loves you personally he cares about you personally he knows you personally and I want us to think about that again today I want us to just think about how he deals with us as individuals and how he leads us and and how he guides us and that's what we want to talk about this morning now uh 1 John chapter 5 is where we'll go first 1 John chapter 5 and verse one and we'll read down to verse four uh tonight this afternoon rather i' I'd like to speak to our young people but I want you all to be here and I I'm want to speak to parents as well uh all of you that can be here I know some have to go home uh because you drive a long ways but if you can be here I'd like to speak to to you about dating and relationships and with our younger people that are coming up it's good for the younger ones to hear that it's a it's good for us parents to hear it and uh and we're just going to talk about those things and kind of the guidelines that are set for us by the message of the hour and uh we're so thankful to have our young people aren't we and and have as many kids as we do around but uh we just want to we just want to always preach the word and teach the word and tell the people the truth and and then we believe the holy spirit will guide each and every life to to the truth so we'll do that this afternoon the Lord willing 1 John 5 And1 it says whosoever believeth that Jesus is the Christ is born of God and everyone that loveth him that begat loveth him also that is begotten of him so he's saying you can't say I love God and I hate my neighbor you can't say I love God and I hate my wife or my husband you can't say I love God and I hate the church right because everyone that loveth him that begat loveth him also that is begotten of him by this we know that we love the children of God when we love God and keep his Commandments this is the love of God that we keep his Commandments and his Commandments are not Grievous for whatsoever is born of God overcometh the worlden whatever is born of God overcometh the world and this is the victory over over cometh the world even our faith faith is our Victory God bless you this morning you may be seated I heard a story of a professor in a a seminary who took his students to a mega church to uh to go and see how they did things and kind of get them used to a church environment in that way and go into this church and cleaning up after the service the only one there's the janitor so he begins talking to the janitor and the janitor standing there and he said it looks like you had a a good crowd today he said yeah he said we processed about a th000 units you know I I don't believe that's the way we ought to look at God's people I don't believe that's the way we ought to look at one another we're not units we're not we're not numbers each one of us individually God cares about am God loves you for who you are individually and he cares about you as an individual I want you to understand that you young people that are here I I want you to understand matne God loves you and cares about you and knew who you were even before you were born and so we we dealt with that Wednesday night with election and and and predestination how that God David said he knew me even in my mother's womb he said he covered me in my mother's womb he protected me and we find out that we weren't just protected from our mother's womb but we were actually a protected thought of God that we were brother random taught us we were in his thoughts and we're actually a protected thought of God that ought to give us great courage today that ought to give us great confidence as we Face life and as we Face the things that are going on all around us as we begin to see that yes I may have a struggle I I might have issues to deal with in my life my my children may not always do what I want them to do my the people around me may not always act like they should but I know I'm protected by God I know that my path of life is covered by him and so the message teaches us that he teaches us that brother random teaches us that God deals with us as individuals not just as he said he deals with Israel as a nation but he deals with the Gentile as an individual so he deals with with Brother Bill and sister Karen individually not just as a couple he deals with you individually he deals with me individually not just as a pastor not just as a husband not just as a as a father but he deals with me as an indiv individual and he and he's watching over me every minute of the day and so we found out even job said he counts my steps so he knows exactly how many steps are between you and the Rapture he he was watching Enoch's life and he knew exactly how many steps were between him and the going home and I tell you what he knows exactly we don't know but he knows we don't know what tomorrow holds but he knows what tomorrow holds and so I'm willing to leave that in his hands God is building us as individuals brother brand said we are God deals with us as individuals to make us a Powerhouse for God so brother brandom says this in the sign of his time sign of this time he says God deals for today that's important God deals for today he said what he does tomorrow is up to him sir and so many people get wrapped up in what God is going to do tomorrow but he says God deals for today right he's interested in today so many times we get even as preachers and I get caught up in it too you get thinking about what's going to happen tomorrow and dealing with what the church is going to be tomorrow but we've got to deal with what the church is today God still heals the sick he still Saves The Lost he he still does what he promised he would do his word is still true even though we're at the end time we still believe that our sick can be healed we still believe our children can be raised in the fear and admonition of the lord we still believe the church is functional as a unit why because God deals for today sir and he always deals with us he said with an individual because groups of men have too many ideas right oh isn't that the truth and so he deals with one man in a generation cause one man to be a prophet and the word is as a conduit comes through that one man and you'll find and I didn't bring up the scriptures but just from memory but you'll find in when God dealt with Samuel when he begin to deal with Samuel at a young age the prophet the Bible tells us in 1 Samuel he said there was no open Vision there was no open Vision there what that means if you go and break it down it means that it means that there was no broken Revelation other words they didn't know they had the book of Moses but they didn't know what was supposed to be going on for their day I'm so glad we don't live in a time like that we live in a time when there is an open Vision that come by a prophet the last prophet to the age right what brother Brandon that we believe believe that he was the seventh angel now now so we know that we have an open Vision but but without an open Vision the people perish but but with an open Vision we know what God is doing today the vision has been broken for today I'm so glad for that so it wasn't with a group of men but it was with one man the B said God dealt with Wesley dealt with Luther and then he dealt with our prophet he dealt with one man at a time for a generation and then through that man he reveals he reveals the word and then we're to take that and believe it and follow it how many you believe that today now brother brandom said he's still God just as much God as he ever was how many believe that oh he's just as much God today as he ever was if he ever healed the sick he does today if he can ever heal cancer he he will today if he can ever heal if he can ever bring my family bring them under the subjection of the word he does it today whatever he has done he will do he's just as much God he said but how can a man say those things unless God tells him first to say it he said God tells him to say it see not under impression all right see we we don't go by impression I don't just sit back there and say what Lord I'm just being impressed to say something no I believe in Inspiration I'm preaching by inspiration but it's inspiration of the word it's because I've lay before the message of the hour and and read what brother brandom said read what the Bible says that's that's what I can't just come out here under impression and preach to you because I can pretty much go anywhere under impression right under impression I could just come out and Hammer somebody come out and and and preach at people and and hurt people and but the only way I can help people is by preaching the word right so we don't preach impression we preach thus sayth the Lord we got something better than an impression we got something better than Pentecostalism we got something better than just what our neighbor said or our uncle said or some story somebody told we've got the word of the Lord and we preach that yes so he says not just under impression but you know what you're saying then do it he said but wait don't try to say oh that's the way many people he said I think in gifts of God he said wait to know it is you know it's God wait till the voice comes and you hear it and know it see it he said then you can say it's thus sayith the Lord he said if it isn't thus sayith the Lord than it's your impression it's what somebody else thinks he said people request people say this for me do this for me he said how can you do it if you're honest with God until God first tells you he said how can I tell you thus sayth Jack Moore and Jack Moore hasn't said nothing to me he said it's got to come first from God all right not impressed he said it's got to be God and then it will happen for it is then thus sayth the lord it's not an impression brother BR talks about interpretation of tongues we believe in tongues we believe in interpretation but interpretation of tongues is not an impression you hear it and repeat what you heard right and so that's not just an impression and I'm going somewhere with this because we need to understand that God has dealt with an individual in our day and then that individual see each one of us is responsible as an individual to that message this is what we were predestined for this is what we were called to this is who we are so he said it's th sayith the Lord he said he said wait till the voice comes and if you don't it's what somebody else thinks he said it's got to come first from God he said not impressed well I wish I could lose some weight and start keeping my coat on he said it's got to be God I I get sweaty up here but I also get sweaty tying my shoes so it's all right he said it's got to come first from God not impressed it's got to be God and then it will happen for it is then thus sayith the Lord sir he said now everybody won't have that now listen no sir I'd love to be able to just follow what everybody tells me but I can't do it I'd love to be able to just do whatever somebody else that's successful what they said but I can't do it because there was one to a generation one to a generation not two or five or 25 but one he said everybody won't have that won't be that way it never was that way it never will be that way God deals with an individual he did in the days of Noah he did in the days of Joshua he did in the days of Moses he has always someone say always he has never made a system it's been an individual cuz two men ain't alike no time see he never did no more but everybody didn't have to be Moses that's a great Revelation to have I don't have to be Moses I don't have to be a prophet they didn't understand it they just followed right he said of the Holy Spirit of a man is Anointed of God God will direct you to follow the Holy Spirit and the Bible for he's the one who does these things he said Jesus Christ in the form of the Holy Ghost working in the people you believe he still works today but he works with individuals he worked with an individual prophet he works with you as an individual makes you responsible to the message for yourself right sir right not just under me but for yourself he said my pastor's a good man well I hope I am but that's not I don't have any bearing on you you you've got to be responsible to the message right well my my my mama has the Holy Ghost but that don't mean you have it right you have to get it for yourself it's the same Faith your mama has for it's the same Faith you can have right amen now he said but brother brand said everybody didn't have to be Moses there was one individual there were seven stars in his hand right Seven Stars in his hand one star for each age one star for this age an indiv idual who preached thus sayith the Lord right oh my and we have thus sayith the Lord when we say what he said and I understand he was human I understand he was a man I understand he was fallible as a man but he was the channel the channel that God used the only channel that God used for this age period if we don't believe that we don't believe the message right he was the individual sent to you now I want you to understand that this message I want us to make it personal again we we look at it as something well I filter the message through my church I filter it through this side or the other it needs to be personal to you again you need to understand that God sent you Elijah the prophet to restore you back to be in that condition again he sent you Elijah he sent me Elijah that's why I was able to come out of the background I come from that's why I was able to overcome so many challenges in life because I've seen God sent me the message of the hour and that same power is here for you God sent you the message of the hour you have the ability to live it you have the ability to believe it and then no one overrides that that's individual the message is for you if the messenger to the age and I'm dealing with this then we'll move on but if the messenger to the age set guidelines for the church when it comes to church order and discipline that's why we have church the way we do that's right you can do whatever you want to but for us we're going to have church because that's what he told us to do if you think you have authority to override that I'll say what brother BR said to Junior Jackson I'm not going to disfellowship you or say you're wrong but that's your troubles but that's for us that's for me in my house and what I'm responsible for we will stay under a Vindicated Prophet I love the way Joshua puts that he said if it seem evil unto you to serve the Lord choose you this day whom you will serve whether the gods which your father served or on the other side of the flood or the gods of the amorites in whose land you dwell but as for me in my house we will serve the Lord every one of us ought to make that statement today as for me I will serve this the Lord I will believe the [Applause] message how did he serve the Lord by saying what Moses said he said he said bind this law obey it believe it amen preach it amen we're doing the same thing now we are individually responsible listen brother brand said God never did deal with a group nowh in the scripture he deals with one individual because every man is different from the other that's right now but Joel's not here this morning so I'll pick on him I pick on him when he is here too but God don't deal with a group because we're different right there could only be one one guy's the pastor and the other one's not right and the reason for that is because we're different right and and he's a singer and I'm not right he can preach ways I wish I could preach I wish I could preach sometimes like Joel does he he's preaching this morning up in in Salem doing a wonderful job but but he can't be me and I can't be him God don't deal with groups he deals individually and yet we work together right brother Stuart that's here with us that has gone today but brother Stewart works with me as a as my partner here in the church and preaching the word of God but I don't go to brother Stuart and tell him what to preach well the people need this and and they need to hear that no he hears that from God right he deals with God directly and so as an individual we're individ ually responsible for what we say across this Pulpit we're individually responsible but we're very different we come from the same parents but we're very different and I want to get into that this morning brother Rand said every man our thumbs are different hold your thumb your your your thumb up your thumb is different from everybody else in the church right our noses are different someone said amen our noses are different our actions are different aren't you glad of that we're not all the same he said he gets one man he can get him perfectly in harmony till he can become that word God help us today now we've got I want to call this today spiritual genetics spiritual genetics because our genes brother random begins to deal with genes in in the message late in the message in 1964 and 1965 genetics is a study of how genes and traits are passed down from one generation to the other so I I got a picture and I don't know if I can read that but I it's and so your body's made up of cells and just hang with me for a minute it'll be okay your body's made up of cells each cell has a chromosome every chromosome contains DNA in your DNA is genes and then your genes is what carries your traits so what kind of music that you like what uh uh what what smells good to you and what doesn't and everybody is different because they've got different genes and then even people with identical genes those genes might be expressed differently through what they call nature and nurture as you go through life that that actually changes now uh Humans Beings have approximately 24,000 different types of genes and the genes make up your DNA they give you your eye color your hair color right now if you remember from Wednesday night brother brandom told us he said Oh my he said he knew your haircut color before you were ever born he knew your hair color before you were ever born so it's our genes that make up our DNA and within a gene what a gene is is a set of instructions it's actually you could say a word that controls your life it's a set of instructions that that control your life so it tells brother Danny's going to have a deep voice and and there was a gene that told that that gave instructions to his body to build in such a way that it would be he would have a deep voice and and certain men will have a real high uh high pitched voice and and some women will look differently and men will look differently and different eye color different hair color why because those genes Express themselves in different ways now and and and they carry that you carry that from your ancestors so uh so now you have uh 23 pairs of chromosomes and inside those chromosomes is the it's the genes now the word Gene was not invented until 1909 I thought that was interesting 1909 the Year brother Brandon was born it didn't crack the genetic code until 1966 but I want you to notice what we read in in our uh in our first scripture 1 John 5:4 whatsoever is born of God yeah so in other words whatever carries the genetics of God now think about it now we're talking spiritually now not naturally but we know that God even even compassed us naturally even even naturally he chose us to be what we are you can go things that are to be listen to things that are to be brother brandom deals with that over and over again he said even even he put you in an area that you would like said if you like mountains he put you in a m Mountain Area you know like that you just think wow God could actually do that caused me to be born in a certain place a certain time he said he prepared for your arrival even in the natural you think he doesn't care about you today you think he doesn't see what you're going through you think he don't see that your grocery bills coming do you know you think he doesn't see that you got that credit card you can't pay off he sees it today he knows about it so now we find out that the spirit in our spiritual genetics if we're born of God we overcome the world right not not that we might overcome or maybe overcome but we do overcome sir whatever is born of God whatever is the spiritual genetics of God overcomes the world now if you're born again today it's because you were in the thoughts of God before the foundation of the earth Brother Band said it never started on any day sir remember we read this you wasn't saved on any day you was always saved he said Jesus just come to redeem that but you were saved from the beginning because you had eternal life to begin with oh I'm so glad for this message that taught us these things now when you were born on the Earth there was already a spiritual germ of life a seed or a gene that come from God and we read this as well Psalms 139:13 but he said you have possessed my Reigns and we found out those Reigns that's that's what your impulse that's your heart it's a word that it's a hebraism actually for kidneys it means your innermost being your Reigns the innermost man and we know we're a Triune being brother B said look here you're an outside person you have five senses that contacts that outside body God gave you five senses not to contact him but your Earthly home see taste feel smell and hear you have a spirit on the inside of that he has five Outlets conscience and love and so forth five Outlets that you contact the spirit world with that but with your spirit he said your physical context to physical your spiritual context is spiritual but inside of that you've got a soul and that soul is that Gene that come from God now think about oh my think about if in our natural genetics he tells us he said even in my mother's womb even my my rain so in other words he knows the color of your hair he knows everything about you and he chose you to be the way that you are right but then in my spiritual genes I come from God so I'm going back to God I come from God so I'll overcome the world are you with me now so now he says it's a that soul is that Gene that come from God and like a baby formed in its mother's womb when the baby comes into the mother's womb by the little germ it crawls into the egg it doesn't form one cell of human the next a dog the next a cat the next a horse he said it's all human cells because it's building off of an original human cell and when a man has been born again by the word of God predestinated to eternal life called the elected it'll be word of God on top of word word on word so don't get discouraged with where you're at see originally the gene when it's first born it's just a it's just like a like like a single cell but every time it builds another cell every time it builds another cell it's going to build more of God right it don't build a monkey today and a dog tomorrow but it builds human cell after human cell it builds more of God and more of God and more of God that's how you know if you're born again that's how you know you have the Holy Ghost how because you're just building more and more and more and more of God every time you come across the word you say yes Lord that's me that's for me healing is for me peace is for me salvation is for me in my house that's for me what's it doing it's building more of God amen amen hallelujah we don't want to get discouraged cuz people change churches change atmospheres change people come in go out things the message the way the people do things change but God doesn't change right so we always want to go back to the word what we want to feed on is the word but the B said you're not feeding on the words of a man you're feeding on the failing body word of the son of man amen right so you want to feed on it keep building it keep building it he said he said not a denominational Creed and then a word and a Creed it won't work sir you can't have that Len in it so I can't afford with the Joe to build the church or an individual in the church or my own life on my thoughts plus the message my thoughts plus the Bible I can't do that right because whatever the word is that has to be what's added that's what's added to that original cell so when you don't see growth whenever you don't see growth in your life you need to look at what you've been adding what you've been feeding on yes if you want to see more growth how many you want to see more growth in your own life Lord I want to grow up I want to be I want to be a mature son or daughter of God I want to live right I want to do and I know I know you do but you want to do that more you want to have more patience and more faith and more godliness more of all these virtues maybe we'll get into later but but well you you want to have more of all of that well how do you do that well you're partakers of the divine nature right that's been deposited into you by the Holy Ghost how do you how do you get more of it brother B say it's like a tree it just drinks more water and it pushes out limbs it drinks more water and it pushes out limbs you drinking more of the word and you push out another limb you drink in more of the word you push out another Limb and pretty soon you become ready for a rapture amen are are you with me now so we want to be a mature church we ought to be mature bride now now said brother Ben I I don't know and sometimes we get scared we think well I don't know how I'm going to ever live a Christian Life and sometimes we make excuses for ourselves well well you know the message is hard and in the message I know I can't I'm supposed to be C conduct my marriage a certain way supposed to do these things a certain way with my finances supposed to do these things a certain way I'm just talking to you this morning but in the message this is way I'm supposed to do you think well I can't really do that no you can do that you how we know that you can because the instructions are in the gene right so the word oh my the word that comes to you matches the word on the inside right so when that seed is awakened by the Holy Spirit what happens in your life is you that that Gene begins to express what for you individually what living the word means in your age so not everyone will speak in tongues not everyone will be a preacher not everyone will run the aisles but that Gene is expressing in your life it's got instructions in it right and you think so well I'll never be able to grow up and be a a husband or a father I'll never be able to live I'll never be able to quit cutting my hair the G the instructions are already in the seat right all you got to do is surrender yourself to the gene it's already there he say it's too hard I'll never be able to do that but it's already in you to do it if you just surrender to it right it's the word and it follows the word so now you when you're born naturally you inherit two pairs of jeans one from your father and one from your mother and I I picked on Joel earlier but I inherited the same set of jeans as Joel he's relatively skinny and I'm fat right and uh but I'm not embarrassed by it I'm just fat but my I look like my dad and he looks more like my mother's side and they they just didn't they weren't as as solid as we are you can go generations back of PRS and they look a little bit like me right and then and then I leaned into that by feeding myself right just pick on myself I leaned into that by feeding feeding myself so that Jean is there and brother Joel's got to watch it or he'll end up leaning into that because he does have that same pair of jeans right you realize you come here you've got human genes right but by your human nature maybe you got a a problem with anger right maybe you got a problem with lust you got a problem with something you know just fly off the top all the time it's a gene it's instructions when something happens maybe alcoholism something it's just written in there it's written into it and you think well I'll never be able to overcome that but remember by the new birth we have a different set of instructions that's right and the same thing that you think well I'll never be able to make it don't you realize that the same power you say well I can't help myself but it'll be the same way as a Christian if you're ever born again of the Holy Spirit you won't be able to help yourself you you don't have to put on something you'll be a Christian you'll live like a Christian you'll walk like a Christian you'll talk like a Christian why because it's on the inside of you expressing out something amen so you don't have to try you don't have to oh you just try to kill yourself so well I'll try to quit smoking I'll TR to quit drinking no just feed on the word let the word become your your whole life let it let lean into that that's right that's good right and I'm sure if I started working out and eat right I'll lose weight even though I have that Gene but what is it what is it there's something becomes dominant in my life now look I express a gene that looks like my father now you the way you look naturally believe it or not was not an accident right you inherited the genes that you did now look look what David says again Psalms 139 they were expressed the way they were on purpose he said Thine Eyes did see my substance yet being unperfect and in myy book all my members were written which in continuance were fashioned when as yet there was none of them so you were made to be expressed a certain way in a certain season brother bom tells us some things that are to be about John 14:2 in my father's house are many mansions he says that's many types of mansions many kinds of man Mansions he said I believe that God is a god of variety the world proves that he's got big mountains and little mountains he's got Plains he's got deserts he's got different things because he made it the way he wanted it so you can't get too discouraged with yourself because he made it the way he wanted it that's and he made the season summer winter spring autumn he made the season it shows he's a god of variety he made you in a variety now Satan wants Conformity that's right right he's trying to deform your life into and what's funny about it is they think they're expressing themselves right and you end up with a whole bunch of tattoos and a whole bunch of rings and stuff like that embedded in their flesh and and you wonder why in the world would somebody do that well it's to be different well there's 400 other ones doing it just like you right and and no matter how tattooed you become there guys out there tattoo their eyeballs right so you well I'm expressing my individuality no God Made You individual that's right you don't have to change your body you don't have to be bulimic and be afraid to eat and and and I know some young ladies struggle with that you don't have to be afraid to eat you don't have to be afraid because God made you to have a body that wasn't like some model somewhere God made you the way you are he didn't just make you like everybody else he made you Jason now I may not look good with red pants on but you look good with red pants on he made you individual are you with me now somebody understand he made you as an individual when it comes to the message we need to we need to approach it as an individual thing this is for me I believe that my healing is for me others might have failed but this is mine this belongs to me a thousand may fall by the wayside but I believe it's for me I might have failed myself before but this is my time this is when I grab a hold of the word of God this is when I become what God wants me to be that's right so he made you in a variety he said he's a god of variety he some men are real blusterous some are real dogmatic others are fine others are kind and if you just find all different kinds of people in his kingdom in his kingdom now look again the BR said you were all pre-planned by God nothing happens by chance with God he knows all about it it's all pre-planned planned for many generations back so that you could be here tonight he said you at one time was in your father in the gene of your father now he didn't know you at that time neither did you know him at that time but you see then he said you were put in the beding ground in the womb of mother through holy wedlock and then you become a person expressed in the image like your father he said then there's Fellowship he said now the only way that you can be a son a daughter of God because you have to have eternal life and there's only one form of eternal life and that's God's life Oh my he said there there to be a Son of God you had to be in him always someone say always always he said the gene of your life spiritual life tonight was in God the Father before there was even a molecule he said and you are nothing but the the manifestation of the gene of life that was in God as a Son of God hallelujah now that ought to kick that old suicide devil right in the teeth it ought to kick that Old Devil tells you you're worthless tells you you don't you meant something to God you the fact you even heard the message ought to be enough to say Lord I'm thankful I'm grateful that you brought the message by my way I'm grateful that you called me out of the world I might have my struggles but I come from God and I'm going back to God I'm grateful he corrects me I'm grateful his word skins me sometimes because I know that I'm going back to God I'm becoming what he wants me to be amen and so he said you're a manifestation of the gene of life that was in God he said now you're expressed after his word has come into you to light up this age amen that's what we ought to be doing today lighting up the age not to be hidden away somewhere and and little just just staying away and not let the world see your light no he said you don't hide a Candlestick under a bushel but you take the bushel off of it let the world see what you are God's life in you amen you you have come now you expressed the light up to say you are the expressing God's life in you because you're a son or daughter of God you are now made I love the way that's intentional that's intentional he made you yes sir you're not an accidental oversight but you're made you're setting in this church tonight because your duty is to express God to this nation and this people and this neighborhood where you associate so everywhere you go you think God there has to be a reason I'm here right right there's a reason I'm here sir you may find yourself flat on your back in a hospital bed but there's a reason I'm here right and then that that changes your whole perspective of things I I couldn't do I couldn't be the light that I am anywhere else we talked about Jonah how God brother br said he uses his permissive will to magnify his perfect will so I find myself flat on my back I I've told you the story before I think but I remember uh being in a hospital for one of the few times in my life I've been in the hospital I was in the hospital for almost a week and and and I'm sitting there feeling sorry for myself thinking you know and my pastor at that time was gone and he's out of town and and wasn't very many people coming to visit me and I was kind of feeling sorry for myself and laying there in the hospital Brother David you know what that's like and laying there in the hospital my my wife was driving back back and forth and one night she leaves she's in my truck which is a newer truck it was it was fine and I didn't worry about it but the alternator went out and uh her cell phone was dead and so she's on the side of the road between Jonesboro and Brooklyn just on the side of the road in the dark with three little babies and three little kids and and she's sitting there wondering what am I going to do so she gets out and starts walking and there's a there's a gas station as far enough the way she can see it but it's a ways down there and she's going down towards Brooklyn and somebody stops and it's it's a lady that her husband is a missionary in in Jonesboro and and they're friends to this day actually and she got a chance to witness to that person and I begin to think in that hospital room I begin to think Lord did you put me here just so that my wife would have to do that so that she could meet that person so she could be a friend to that person cuz maybe that person was somebody who who would be good to the bride who would give my wife a ride on the way so she could be saved you think would God do that absolutely God would do that would he care enough about my life to do that absolutely he would you say well I'm struggling with my job right now I'm strugg I wonder if you wouldn't look at it like this Lord you put me in my situation to be a light to my neighborhood be a light in the job where a man let me be that light Lord let me show them how a Christian handles a difficult circumstance let me show them that a Christian don't quit when things get rough let me show them that a Christian goes to church and lives loves God and lives for God and does the things they're supposed to do even when it's hard sir let me be a light hallelujah amen so wherever you are God knew that you would be here because you have to be one of his jeans or his attributes he said you had to be if you ever if you've got eternal life then it always was eternal life right oh my and God before there was a foundation World knew that you would be here sir he said when the word the water the washing of the the word fell upon you it was expressed in a being he said now you have fellowship with your father God just as you have with your Earthly father you're citizens of the king not citizens but your children Sons and Daughters of the Living God if it be that the eternal life dwells in you he said now then if it was Jesus was the fullness of godhead man of God manifested he was the fullness of the godhead bodily therefore when you came to the Earth was manifested in flesh you were in him then because he was the word so he tells us you were with him in death with him in burial with him in Resurrection right you were in him on the cross right he said now if we are those attributes of God we cannot live by Creeds we cannot live by denominationalism we must live by the word we must live by the word because the Bride is a part of the bridegroom like any wife is a part of her husband therefore we must be that word bride and let me say this we must live the word yes go back and listen to the Token brother brand tells us it's not enough to say I believe it it's not enough to listen to it right but you've got to live it you've got to become that word and what we're doing as a church is we're we're trying to live it we're not trying just to hear it because we must hear it but we must also live it that's why we we do what we do because we must live the word he said we must live by the word because a bride is part of the bridegroom like any wife is part of her husband we must be that word bride what is that word bride the manifestation of this hour the manifestation of this hour the bride not a Creed or denomination but living Oracle of God a living attribute of God displaying to the world the attributes of God in the formation of the Bride that's to be expressed in this hour that we're now living He said Martin Luther could not express the attributes that we express because that was in the beginning the resurrection like the corn of wheat went to the Earth are you still with me this morning just a few more minutes we'll close he said he talked about a man who didn't understand the Dark Ages because he had no Revelation right and this is important because many times we don't understand what's going on because we we lack Revelation you need to know what what's for your hour amen what's going on in your hour what we're supposed to be doing in the hour you live him amen they didn't understand the Dark Ages because of no Revelation How could a merciful god do that right he said he didn't understand he said he didn't have the re he said the revelation of Jesus Christ in this hour not what he was in another hour what he was now the Bible expresses this growing in the bride to the full stature he said the therefore if the corn of wheat of Christ had to fall in the ground so did the bride have to fall in the ground through the Dark Ages any grain that goes in the ground must die or it cannot reproduce itself and the great church that he established on the day of Pentecost by the sending of the Holy Ghost had to suffer marom martyrdom and go into the dirt into the dark into the Earth in the Dark Age to bring forth again the age of Luther and come on out to the full stature of the Bride of Jesus Christ for this last day therefore the bride in the Rapture will someone say will are you worried about missing the Rapture you say if I don't do this if I don't do that don't that's Catholicism if you are pre-planned by God you will go in the Rapture know how many eyes you you dot how many tees you cross you will go in the Rapture because you belong to God sir you won't go in cuz I said so right there' be a lot of surprises I'll be surprised by some people who make it mostly by myself right all of us will be I'm just just be honest you'll be a little bit surprised that you made it cuz you know you better than anybody but I'm so glad for his grace and brother BR said if you find me he said when when you find me he said I'll be one over there by the by the trees that sing an Amazing Grace how sweet to sound that saved a Wretch like Me it took his grace to make me what I am it'll take his grace to make me what I will be the brand said therefore the bride and the Rapture will come forth there was all pre-planned by God all backed up he said from the beginning he knew every man every place who would set all about it it's all pre-plan God knew it would be here you can back look back over your life and you can see by faith you can see oh this happened in my life and I thought it was a terrible thing but then I look and see what God did out of that and out of the ashes of my the burning down of what I thought my idea of life was he created something else oh God and I don't Oh my he created something better he never does something worse he always does something better I thought this was it I thought this preacher this this pastor or this church or or this was it but no God was all all the time working doing something you didn't even expect bringing something you didn't even foresee but it's here today and you look at it and think God I know you were working that gives me confidence for the future you might be doing something now that I can't see but you're doing it anyway you're working in my life Hallelujah that's true yes sir amen now look I'm just being honest with you naturally if you have a gene with the instructions that passed on to you from your father to like alcohol you're more likely to like alcohol if you have a gene that causes depression anxiety you're more likely to do that because that's in your genes you realize that all of us express those at one point in our life and we just made a good job of it all of us did 1 Corinthians 6:9 know you not the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God he said be not deceived neither fornicators nor idolators nor adulterers they're just expressing what they are sinners or effeminate homosexuality abusers of themselves with mankind thieves Covetous drunkards revilers extortioners shall inherit the kingdom of God I that's going to inherit the kingdom of God but I love this scripture and such were some of you [Music] amen amen such were some of you maybe you were in a dead cold formal church maybe you were in a denomination maybe you were maybe you were a person who didn't go to church at all maybe you did everything bad you could do such were some of you but thank you Lord hallelujah I'm so glad for the message of the hour that washed me I'm so glad for the spirit of God that washes me today but you are washed but you are Sanctified but you are justified by the name of the Lord Jesus by the spirit of our God hallelujah but you are washed oh I'm so grateful for that today sister Stephanie you know what I'm talking about you expressed that in your life but now you're expressing something else some of the rest of you you know maybe it's been years ago maybe you need to go back and think about it again brother JT one day you express the genes of an alcoholic but today youve sit in church for decades and believe the word of God why because there's something inside of you that there there was another Gene another set of instructions that told you to do something such were some of you but you're washed we can't look down on nobody that's right but you're washed see there's a g Gene that dominates your life that's why two siblings one has a dominant gene that expresses a certain color of hair and the other one has a dominant gene expresses the other color of hair see the seed life in in us has to be the dominant gene that's what the baptism of the Holy Ghost does it causes that Gene seed to dominate your life produce the fruit of the spirit Nicodemus came to Jesus by night I don't have time to read all of this but if you go to John chapter three Jesus tells him in verse five Jesus verily I say to the except a man be born of water and the spirit you cannot enter into the kingdom of God that which is born of the flesh is flesh and that which is born of the spirit is spirit amen what's Born Again The Soul that's right and the Soul has to dominate the spirit the soul has to dominate The Flesh right Matthew 1:18 listen Mary when the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise when as his M mother Mary was espoused to Joseph before they came together she was found with child of what of the Holy Ghost thank you Lord and the conception brother B taught us was without sensation he say the mystery of the baptism the Holy Ghost without sensation but the person of Christ performing in you the same works that he did thank you hallelujah hallelujah so it's it's the baptism of the Holy Ghost that produces a life so the spirit of God begins to move over you and it takes the spirit of God to bring that to life how many believe that today he's building you as an individual by putting you in the right atmosphere for a birth he puts you under the right warant puts you in a church or put you in a family or put you somewhere where you can be born that's right put you in the right atmosphere to be bored oh I'm so grateful for that today today he said now no matter what stage you're in there's nothing that will keep you from becoming a reflection of him brother B said there's nothing that can keep me from rising in the do you believe that today in the resurrection there's nothing that can keep me from rising there ain't enough devils in all hell can keep me from rising there ain't nothing nowhere to keep me from rising he said I have the promise of God he said I have the Holy Spirit I got Zoe God's eternal life resting in here this old carcass come from there and God brooded me out of the ground that's right he talked about how we had no choice in our natural birth right and he talks like this after telling his life story he said if he made me what I am without a choice come on now right you didn't have a choice in being born in the family you were born in you didn't have a choice in any of that he said if you made you what you were without a choice how much more when that Holy Ghost goes to brooding over me and I say yay Lord You're My Creator I love you and I accept you as my savior how you going to hold me in the dust amen just can't do it brother listen what brother BR says he said God never formed one piece of this Calum or potash or anything else that'll ever be wasted that's right hlj what a powerful thought just go chew on that for a while amen quotes John 6:39 he said this is the Father's will which you sent me all of of all which you have given me I should lose nothing but should raise it up again at the last day I heard him call he said when I come to him how can they keep me in the dust of the earth there ain't enough undertakers in the world to Pat me in the face with a shovel whatever keep me in the dust of the earth I shall rise someday and stand in his likeness washed in his blood hallu born of his Spirit oh do you believe it today do you believe it could you raise your hands with me say I believe it I believe I'm a she Gene of God I believe I was born to overcome the world oh my if you really believe it you will overcome the world he do you believe it today let's let's stand together and give him praise Lord we love you oh we love you today we thank you Lord we worship you today oh we thank you for your goodness oh do you love him now thank you Lord amen do you love him amen I wonder the musicians come maybe you're struggling to express those genetics of the word in your life why don't you just let the Holy Spirit that's here this morning brood over your life am just let him bro he had to Bro over that word over those seeds those jeans in the beginning he had to Bro over it let it become what it was why don't you just let him bro over your life for a moment get in that right atmosphere and just surrender to him that's right he'll do the rest that's right it's there the instructions are there you just got to yield to it that's right amen hey would you bow your heads with me Heavenly Father Lord we just love you today today we're so grateful Lord I'm so grateful for the teaching that we have Lord that we're not we're not vulnerable to The Winds of doctr not vulnerable to the whims of a church or even a pastor but Lord we have an individual relationship with you so grateful for that today Lord Lord I believe each one of these people that are here this morning they they've responded to the word Lord in my own broken way I've tried to preach it but Lord you I believe you've been in it because we it's your message that you brought in our day and Lord I pray you'd take those words that were yours or sink them down in the hearts of the people may they may they really believe that not one bit of this pot ash or cting whatever it is that we're made up of not one ounce of this dirt that we're created from will ever be wasted but God made us the way we are for a reason he's going to raise us up one day you're going to raise us up Lord I'm so thankful for that Lord I pray that you just move I I realize there's people here maybe struggling with things maybe they've been a Christian and they've Fallen back and they've just kind of gotten out of it and oh God I pray you'd stir them up today lord they're they're put here to express something we're put here to to be a light in our generation I pray you'd help us stir us up God lord may we not be controlled by the by just the arbitrary Winds of life but Lord may we feel the wind of the Holy Spirit today may we be covered by your blood may we be exactly what your word said we would be we believe we can be today I pray we would we would do that and manifest that in our lives I pray for these young people today that you'd bless them Lord as we'll focus on them tonight I pray God that you just move in their lives fill them with the Holy Spirit oh God I pray you'd touch them God I pray you'd touch the elders Lord each one Lord you know what we have
