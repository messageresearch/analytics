[46:32] blessed by a touch from the Lord at camp
[46:35] this year I thoroughly enjoyed and
[46:37] appreciate the effort that was put in to
[46:38] having a holy ghost filled camp and I
[46:40] would say Amen to that than Lord amen
[46:43] we're thank we we thank the Lord for men
[46:45] that'll put in a lot of effort I I watch
[46:48] them they're tired brother Wendell has
[46:50] done a phenomenal job at that camp I
[46:51] know a lot of y'all have been to the
[46:52] Louisiana camp and you've seen what
[46:54] they've done down there and I I've never
[46:56] been but but this Camp over here is a
[46:58] little closer and so we've tried to
[46:59] support it just as much as we could and
[47:01] and I believe we're seeing the fruits of
[47:03] that now and uh I want to go up here
[47:06] sister sister Emma where are you here
[47:09] you do you want to come up and say this
[47:10] or you want me to tell it for you okay

[47:17] didn't she do a good job singing tonight
[47:20] all our kids
[47:23] wonderful I'm just buying time where I
[47:25] don't have to preach if I take take
[47:27] enough time telling
[47:29] stories sister sister Emma really
[47:32] blessed my heart I I saw this one the
[47:33] other day and I'll try to get through
[47:35] this one through the past couple of
[47:37] months I've been feeling really low like
[47:38] I wasn't good enough for nobody and the
[47:41] devil kept telling me maybe you're not
[47:42] the bride maybe you're just a mistake he
[47:45] was trying to make me depressed and I
[47:47] felt like getting the Holy Ghost was
[47:48] super complicated and almost impossible
[47:51] but when I got in the prayer line at
[47:52] Camp I realized just how lost I was and
[47:55] that if I didn't get a hold of Jesus I
[47:56] might as well just give up then I just
[47:59] started crying and sincerely praying and
[48:02] when I got to the ministers and felt
[48:03] that anointing it felt like everything
[48:05] just lifted off of me and I heard
[48:07] brother Andrew saying she's going
[48:08] through that door then it was like I
[48:10] felt the Holy Spirit blow through me so
[48:12] when I got back to my seat I was just
[48:14] balling then it dawned on me I got it
[48:17] thank the Lord praise the Lord for
[48:21] that she said I was expecting something
[48:24] huge Supernatural experience but it was
[48:26] just so simple
[48:27] oh yes anyways when brother Timothy
[48:29] mentioned Eternal destination Sunday
[48:30] morning I knew where I was going aren't
[48:32] you thankful I say praise the Lord for
[48:37] it brother Landon he's back there
[48:39] tonight running video he raised his hand
[48:42] you probably didn't see him but I did I
[48:44] love brother Landon he was a real I tell
[48:46] you what got to know him a little better
[48:48] going on this trip and uh what a what a
[48:52] good young man he is proud of him proud
[48:54] of very proud of him and I I'll say this
[48:57] I don't want to embarrass our kids I
[48:59] love our kids but I was had the
[49:00] privilege of being in that prayer line
[49:02] and to watch kids that are quiet you
[49:05] know you don't see them move a
[49:06] lot forgive me I'm just a baby don't
[49:09] look at me when I'm crying I look at
[49:11] these kids and when they come through
[49:12] that prayer line and have to help them
[49:14] through because the spirit of the Lord
[49:15] was so strong on them they couldn't
[49:17] hardly walk I'm going to tell you right
[49:18] now that's not a put on that's not them
[49:20] kids just acting like them kids that's
[49:22] the Holy Spirit getting hold of them
[49:23] kids now I've been there I felt it don't
[49:26] don't tell me that's just emotionalism
[49:28] church that's the Holy Spirit coming
[49:29] down on these
[49:30] kids now we don't want to Let's
[49:33] encourage them let's get behind them
[49:34] let's not try to beat them down say well
[49:36] go ahead they need
[49:39] encouragement if any's going to if
[49:41] anybody's going to make it out of L to
[49:43] see it's going to have to be some kids
[49:44] filled with the Holy Ghost that are not
[49:46] afraid I tell you what we've got too
[49:48] many people out here accusing our youth
[49:50] camps saying they're too emotional I say
[49:53] let go and let God have his way in our
[49:54] young people
[49:59] Landon said this he said I had a similar
[50:01] experience to Emma I've been struggling
[50:02] for a while with depression and feeling
[50:04] confused about my direction in life I
[50:06] had a loser mentality and felt unloved
[50:08] and isolated before I went to Camp I did
[50:10] not want to go through the prayer line
[50:11] at first because I had a lot of anxiety
[50:13] about it but the day of the prayer line
[50:15] I felt compelled to go through and after
[50:17] I was prayed for I felt weightless and
[50:19] like a burden was lifted from me since
[50:21] I've returned from Camp I've been
[50:22] happier and feel like my relationship
[50:24] with God has gotten stronger say praise
[50:26] the Lord Brother
[50:29] Landon love you
[50:31] buddy brother trip big old boy like you
[50:35] ought to be able to stand up here and
[50:36] tell this
[50:38] yourself I got to tell this
[50:41] first we's on our way home and and you
[50:44] know Wendell's got a specific way of
[50:46] talking and it's very
[50:49] catchy and brother wendle might have
[50:51] used the phrase you know my cup's just
[50:53] running over a few times during those
[50:56] meetings so I get in the van we're
[50:57] coming home and I hear from the back
[50:59] well my cup's just running
[51:01] over
[51:04] Hallelujah from the back I look back
[51:06] it's trip I was like well my
[51:08] goodness the boy got anointed while he
[51:10] was
[51:12] gone you preach if you get that voice
[51:16] buddy he said here's my testimony when I
[51:19] arrived at Camp I immediately felt like
[51:21] I wasn't good enough to be there and I
[51:22] felt like you haven't been in the
[51:24] message long enough to be at this camp
[51:26] in the day devil was constantly
[51:27] attacking me saying you don't belong
[51:29] here that's what the devil says too a it
[51:32] that's when you know it's the devil when
[51:33] he tells you he don't you don't belong
[51:34] in
[51:36] church he said and I don't understand
[51:38] why you are here there isn't anything
[51:39] for you here but something told me to
[51:41] keep pressing on as the services
[51:43] progressed I began to have a feeling
[51:44] like the devil is going to be defeated
[51:46] and the prayer line Saturday night I
[51:48] went through and as each Minister prayed
[51:50] I felt chains falling off of me and as
[51:53] soon as I made it back to my seat I fell
[51:55] down in the prayer in prayer and then I
[51:57] had the simple Revelation that I am good
[52:00] enough to follow the message
[52:04] Hallelujah I am good enough to walk
[52:06] close with God no matter my past I say
[52:09] praise the Lord to
[52:12] that if it's under the blood God don't
[52:14] even see it I'm proud of our kids give
[52:17] them a big hand I I tell you what very
[52:19] proud of
[52:22] them and i' I'd like to say this I want
[52:25] to thank the church I know brother Ben
[52:26] men personally paid for all the camp
[52:28] fees and helped a lot on the way over
[52:30] there and and uh I tell you what if we
[52:32] can do it again I I think it'd be
[52:35] wonderful I think the old when these
[52:37] kids get of age I highly encourage you
[52:39] to send them kids to Youth Camp you say
[52:41] well why why do they have to go to Camp
[52:43] well there's an atmosphere there of
[52:44] expectation yeah and an atmosphere of
[52:47] expectation is important for these kids
[52:49] to get in the presence you got to get a
[52:51] uh brother Bram talks about an egg and I
[52:53] might get to it here in a minute but he
[52:54] talks about an egg he said you can put
[52:55] it under a puppy you can put it anywhere
[52:57] but it's got to be an atmosphere there's
[52:59] got to be a certain temperature there
[53:00] it's almost got to be you got to get
[53:02] these kids we got to get them right and
[53:05] there's nothing we can do personally but
[53:06] it's got to take the Holy Ghost in their
[53:08] lives and uh as parents I think it would
[53:10] do us good to make sure we keep our kids
[53:13] in Services where the Holy Ghost
[53:16] is I think we need to always come
[53:18] expecting the Holy Spirit to move in
[53:20] church why because it could it could
[53:22] determine their Eternal destination
[53:25] every service we have come on is
[53:27] important for that child that's sitting
[53:28] there so with that being said do you
[53:32] love our kids would you give them
[53:33] another big hand are you proud of them
[53:36] now let's stand together they didn't
[53:38] take up as much time as they should have
[53:41] but I've just got something real short
[53:42] so I won't hold you long how many love
[53:44] the Lord tonight oh yeah man I told the
[53:48] kids I said you I said you back them
[53:50] preachers at camp and stand you standing
[53:52] up and raising your hands and shouting
[53:54] and they I think Ben said well well if
[53:56] you preach like they did they'll back
[53:57] you like they
[53:59] did so I ain't expecting
[54:02] much if you have your Bibles let's let's
[54:05] turn to we're just going to skip that
[54:07] first one sister Joan we're Genesis 1
[54:08] and two uh Genesis 1 verse one and two
[54:12] Genesis 1 1 and two and then I'll let
[54:14] you be
[54:17] seated in the beginning God created the
[54:20] Heaven and Earth and the Earth was
[54:22] without form and void and darkness was
[54:24] upon the face of the deep and the spirit
[54:27] of God moved upon the face of the waters
[54:30] oh thank you and you may be seated may
[54:32] the Lord add His blessings to the
[54:33] reading of the word it's reading there
[54:35] and and and if you notice it says the
[54:38] Earth was without form and void and
[54:39] darkness was upon the face of the earth
[54:41] and the spirit of God moved upon the
[54:43] face the spirit of God had to do
[54:45] something in the beginning we've needed
[54:47] the spirit of God from then and we still
[54:49] need the spirit of God today we can't
[54:51] get by without it and brother Brandon
[54:53] was talk was was here he says he he said
[54:57] A man was made to be a God he said do
[54:59] you know that he's in the image of God
[55:01] he's a Son of God he's like him he was
[55:03] given domain and dominion over the whole
[55:06] earth he said that's right he Ruled the
[55:08] Earth he ruled the animal kingdom and
[55:09] all other kingdoms and all but the
[55:12] kingdom of God above he was God he was
[55:14] an amateur God he was made in the image
[55:17] of God and made like God he had hands
[55:19] like God feet like God he was in the
[55:21] image of God he said what happened
[55:24] because he disbelieved God's word it
[55:25] sent him right back out uh to shift for
[55:29] himself now he said God's trying to
[55:31] bring him back again and when you have
[55:34] faith and accept him he said my brother
[55:36] just let that little light begin to grow
[55:39] and taking all the roots of doubt and
[55:41] bitterness and yielding yourself to the
[55:43] spirit and then you begin to become a
[55:45] son and daughter of God he said you
[55:47] begin to grow in the grace of God the
[55:49] Holy Spirit begins to build his kingdom
[55:51] within you he said now if you've grieved
[55:53] that Spirit somewhere then go right back
[55:55] and think in your mind what did I start
[55:57] doing come on what did you start doing
[56:00] to grieve the spirit of God now you need
[56:02] to go back to that spot wherever you
[56:04] were grieving the spirit of God and
[56:06] neglect he said what was it he said he
[56:08] he said go back if you've grieved the
[56:10] spirit go back in your mind he said what
[56:11] did I start doing neglecting church
[56:13] that's what he says question mark
[56:15] neglecting church he said did I start
[56:16] picking on this one or doing this to my
[56:18] neighbor if you did that's what sapped
[56:21] it out so I would say tonight if if we
[56:24] could really get serious about getting
[56:26] the presence of God back in our church
[56:28] again and creating an atmosphere an
[56:30] atmosphere of worship for our young
[56:32] people I think that we can see God come
[56:34] right down here in our local assembly
[56:36] and fill young people with the Holy
[56:38] Ghost fill some of our elders with the
[56:40] Holy Ghost and you wouldn't see people
[56:42] sitting out of church for no reason you
[56:43] wouldn't see young people backsliding so
[56:45] easily but what you would see is Sons
[56:48] and Daughters of God being made manifest
[56:51] right here Among Us what is it we've got
[56:53] to get serious about this thing if you
[56:55] want to see the these young people stay
[56:57] in
[56:58] church but what if we're just going to
[57:00] play church as parents what do you
[57:01] expect our young people to do if we just
[57:04] going to well come on somebody you want
[57:06] to see your young people filled with the
[57:07] Holy Ghost let's create an atmosphere
[57:09] for them to receive the Holy Ghost in
[57:11] well they we can just send them to Youth
[57:13] Camp yes sir but what about right here
[57:14] on a Sunday morning and a Sunday
[57:16] afternoon and a Wednesday night I say
[57:18] it's time that as parents and as as
[57:21] Elders here in the church and as
[57:22] Believers in this message of the hour
[57:24] it's time we stand up take
[57:26] responsibility for a service that may go
[57:29] wrong no we don't want to just mail it
[57:30] in on a Wednesday night or mail it in on
[57:32] a Sunday night but let's get up here and
[57:35] give everything we've got to the spirit
[57:37] of God and give way for Liberty in the
[57:40] services right here in our home Church
[57:42] see we don't have to wait for Youth Camp
[57:44] I'm thankful for Youth Camp I'm thankful
[57:47] to see these young people moved by the
[57:48] spirit of God you say why don't they get
[57:50] moved in church maybe because we haven't
[57:52] created an atmosphere for them to be
[57:55] moved by yet amen come on well come on
[57:58] somebody I think it's time we get
[57:59] ourselves out of the way and let's put
[58:02] our young people ahead of ourselves
[58:04] let's get our preconceived notions out
[58:06] of the way let's get our little
[58:07] complexes out of the way let's get our
[58:09] anxieties out of the way and let our
[58:11] young people have a right to the freedom
[58:14] of this of serving God again come on pre
[58:18] the problem is we've carried so much
[58:20] baggage with us from Egypt and we've
[58:23] went back and we' started taking so much
[58:25] baggage over and we we just you got to
[58:27] lay it down Church you got to get rid of
[58:30] it there's no you know what if you start
[58:31] living like you've been an abused person
[58:34] then you'll start abusing your children
[58:35] the same way you were you've got to lay
[58:38] that down and let that child have a
[58:40] chance at Freedom let the child have a
[58:43] chance why because we don't want to
[58:45] carry over I I don't want to act like my
[58:47] parents did but by living in the past to
[58:50] what my mom or what my dad did I love my
[58:52] mom Sorry by by living in the past and
[58:55] say well my dad was this way and my dad
[58:57] was this way if I live on that all the
[58:59] time then my children are going to
[59:01] suffer for what my dad
[59:03] did and the sins of the generations will
[59:06] continue to visit but it takes the Holy
[59:08] Ghost to break that cycle and you say
[59:11] well why do we need our children to get
[59:13] the Holy Ghost because we don't want
[59:14] them to be like we were we don't want
[59:16] them to be like our parents was I don't
[59:18] care how good they were before they were
[59:20] Holy Ghost filled Christians I don't
[59:22] want my children to be like that I want
[59:25] my children to have a at Freedom I want
[59:27] them in an atmosphere of Liberty where
[59:30] Christ can be revealed to them
[59:33] personally how do we do that he said did
[59:35] you ever notice he said you see people
[59:38] nice people he said but you just
[59:40] couldn't hardly stand to be around them
[59:42] he said nice people it's their
[59:44] atmosphere that they're in you know you
[59:46] can't stand to be around people that
[59:48] have been in a bad atmosphere because
[59:50] they have actually created the
[59:51] atmosphere that they're in that's right
[59:53] and he said now he said now you've seen
[59:55] other people he said and you just long
[59:57] to be with him is that right he said
[59:59] it's that atmosphere that's around them
[1:00:01] all the time he said now my wife sitting
[1:00:04] back there she don't know this but and
[1:00:05] he tells this story I Tred to skip
[1:00:07] through it for time's sake he he said
[1:00:09] she was going in and he said people
[1:00:10] coming and going and making the house
[1:00:12] just in chaos and and he said not even a
[1:00:14] chance to cook and the children could
[1:00:16] just anything to eat through the day and
[1:00:17] there was I mean it was just chaos there
[1:00:19] at the house and he said uh he said

[1:00:28] wife crying and she' look up and she
[1:00:30] said Bill I'm just about to go

[1:00:35] prophet's wife and a prophet's home and
[1:00:37] it just got bad it just got there were
[1:00:39] so many people around they just couldn't
[1:00:40] have a good time they they just couldn't
[1:00:42] get in the right atmosphere and he said
[1:00:45] but he tells you how to deal with it
[1:00:46] this is what I like he said and there he
[1:00:48] said my wife crying and Bill I'm about
[1:00:50] to go crazy I don't know what I'm going
[1:00:51] to do she said I I'm gray-headed at 34
[1:00:53] years old I'm just a few years behind
[1:00:56] and said honey and he said I never he
[1:00:59] said don't fuss at
[1:01:01] her come on husbands don't fuss at her
[1:01:06] man it got
[1:01:09] quiet don't fuss at her if your wife's
[1:01:13] having a bad day don't fuss at her
[1:01:14] that's just going to make it worse if
[1:01:16] your husband's have a bad having a bad
[1:01:18] day don't nag at him it's going to make
[1:01:20] it
[1:01:21] worse it it's up to you to create the
[1:01:24] atmosphere in your home
[1:01:26] and the atmosphere you create around
[1:01:28] your wife or your spouse affects your
[1:01:30] children yes it does and it actually you
[1:01:33] can have a more positive effect at home
[1:01:35] on your children than you can even at
[1:01:37] church if it's a good atmosphere but the
[1:01:40] problem is we've got too many people
[1:01:42] living like Christians here and going
[1:01:44] home and living like the world we can't
[1:01:46] do that and expect our children to be
[1:01:49] holy ghost filled Christian
[1:01:51] kids and he said he said going on like
[1:01:54] that he said don't fuss at her he said
[1:01:56] that's right honey see it's very bad but
[1:01:58] we're serving the lord and he said what
[1:02:00] what I'm doing all the time he said in
[1:02:02] my heart I'm trying to create a
[1:02:03] different atmosphere he said they're all
[1:02:05] nervous and tore up see he said I was
[1:02:07] thinking in my heart oh Lord send your
[1:02:09] presence and your love to my poor little
[1:02:10] tore up wife well that's that's good
[1:02:12] that's a good recipe right there if you
[1:02:14] want to fix the marriage why don't you
[1:02:15] just send your presence and fix it is my
[1:02:17] home in chaos Lord send your presence
[1:02:20] and fix it this is what a prophet said I
[1:02:23] think it's something we should apply to
[1:02:24] our lives if we really want to have a
[1:02:26] home where the atmosphere is Pleasant oh
[1:02:29] thank you Lord he said and he said oh we
[1:02:31] haven't had anything to eat and she said
[1:02:32] well we haven't had anything to eat and
[1:02:34] say well there probably won't be anybody
[1:02:35] else for the next couple hours let's get
[1:02:37] something to eat and I'll help you and
[1:02:38] I'll start getting up my sleeves and she
[1:02:40] said now look young man you might be
[1:02:42] able to help me with dishes but you
[1:02:43] can't cook and he said I'll say well who
[1:02:45] can't cook like that you know just going
[1:02:47] on well you haven't ever seen me fried
[1:02:49] potatoes yet I was raised on them
[1:02:51] something like that he said just see a
[1:02:52] little bitty smile trickle on her face
[1:02:55] you see what you say is
[1:02:57] important that's right what you what you
[1:03:00] do in your home is important for how
[1:03:03] your kids are going to turn out how you
[1:03:06] respond in church is important for how
[1:03:09] your kids are going to turn out if
[1:03:12] you're always mad at the pastor because
[1:03:14] he's preaching against sin it's not the
[1:03:16] pastor you need to get mad at it's the
[1:03:18] sin in your life you need to get mad at
[1:03:20] if you're always getting mad at the
[1:03:22] pastor because you're missing church and
[1:03:24] he's preaching about going to church
[1:03:26] well the way to get rid of that
[1:03:27] condemnation is start going to
[1:03:30] church and you won't feel bad no more
[1:03:33] well can you say praise the
[1:03:37] Lord little bitty smile trickle he said
[1:03:39] well I come over here and I put my hand
[1:03:41] on her and she don't know what I'm doing
[1:03:42] yet he said Oh my he said and then I he
[1:03:46] said he said bless your heart honey
[1:03:47] there's my quote from I bless your
[1:03:50] heart he said I'll help you do this and
[1:03:52] then down in my heart I'm saying Lord
[1:03:53] send me peace your peace that's in my
[1:03:55] yes and me into her now oh God quiet my
[1:03:59] family and he goes on down here he said
[1:04:01] what is it it's creating an atmosphere
[1:04:04] he said brother let me tell you Brothers
[1:04:06] the atmosphere is what does it it's
[1:04:08] exactly right look it's not the hen that
[1:04:11] Hatches the Egg it's the atmosphere he
[1:04:14] said you put that same egg under a pup
[1:04:15] and it would hatch in the incubator it
[1:04:17] would hatch uh put it under any chicken
[1:04:19] it'll hatch you can put an eagle egg he
[1:04:21] taught us under a chicken it'll still
[1:04:23] hatch an eagle so the home you but but
[1:04:25] youve got to get an atmosphere there
[1:04:27] where they can at least be born you got
[1:04:29] to get them to church where they can at
[1:04:30] least be born and then how you raise
[1:04:32] them I I believe they'll find that
[1:04:33] mother eagle flying over the Barnyard
[1:04:35] but let's get these kids born let's get
[1:04:37] these kids the Holy Ghost where they'll
[1:04:39] have something to hold them and
[1:04:41] something to fall back on and I would
[1:04:43] like to say this I wonder if us as
[1:04:45] parents could check up on our own life
[1:04:47] and say do I have the Holy Ghost oh come
[1:04:50] on pre we want our kids to get the Holy
[1:04:52] Ghost but what about me what about our
[1:04:55] parents what about well come on somebody
[1:04:57] I know that's a that's a that's a hard
[1:04:59] subject to think about but it's one
[1:05:01] thing to want your kids to be saved and
[1:05:02] filled with the Holy Ghost but what
[1:05:04] about me how am I ever going to have the
[1:05:06] faith for my children if I'm not even
[1:05:08] sure I'm saved how am I going to have
[1:05:10] faith for my kids to receive the Holy
[1:05:12] Ghost if I still question whether I have
[1:05:14] it or not how am I going well come on
[1:05:16] somebody you know it's the truth you sat
[1:05:19] there and you question your own
[1:05:20] salvation and you have your own little
[1:05:22] pity parties there at home and you're
[1:05:24] like well I just don't want to take my
[1:05:25] kids to church today cuz I don't feel

[1:05:40] obedience to the word for the sake of
[1:05:42] our children do you realize if there's a
[1:05:44] tomorrow that our children are either
[1:05:46] going to be out here on the streets
[1:05:48] running drugs and and living like the
[1:05:50] world or they're going to be sitting
[1:05:51] here in the house of God worshiping and
[1:05:54] it's up to you to determine a lot of
[1:05:56] what they
[1:05:58] do that's right come on it's the
[1:06:02] truth you know we can play Church all we
[1:06:04] want to we can come and act religious on
[1:06:06] Sunday mornings all we want to but are
[1:06:07] we living a life in front of that kid

[1:06:18] that's my duty now no let's get on fire
[1:06:20] for God as parents and then we can watch
[1:06:22] our children get on fire too yes sir not
[1:06:26] to call you out but I watched sister
[1:06:27] Stephanie come back to the Lord did you
[1:06:29] know that if she wouldn't have come back
[1:06:30] to the Lord Brother the trip may not be
[1:06:31] sitting here today come on preach well
[1:06:35] let's just get real for a minute if I'm
[1:06:37] not coming to church my kids probably
[1:06:39] ain't coming to church if you're not in
[1:06:41] church your kids ain't in church who's
[1:06:42] it hurting your kids right preach come
[1:06:46] on well I can be just as good of a
[1:06:48] Christian no you
[1:06:49] can't come on a prophet told you you
[1:06:52] cannot be as good of a Christian and
[1:06:53] stay home as you can church now I don't
[1:06:57] know if that's one time a week two times
[1:06:58] a week three times or once a year I
[1:07:00] don't know but I'm just going to take
[1:07:02] what he said and go every time the doors
[1:07:03] are open if I can possibly be there let
[1:07:06] me be at what did David say one thing if
[1:07:10] I long for that I may dwell in the house
[1:07:12] of the Lord and inquire in his Temple
[1:07:14] that's what I want to do that's the
[1:07:16] desire of my heart and if that is not
[1:07:18] the desire of your heart then church
[1:07:21] it's time that you receive the Holy
[1:07:23] Ghost because the holy ghost will cause
[1:07:26] you to obey the word of God oh yes
[1:07:31] well all right come on trip said You
[1:07:34] Preach at my parents and he said I'll
[1:07:36] back
[1:07:40] you you know what I I I love to see our
[1:07:43] kids on fire for the Lord but I do
[1:07:45] wonder sometimes what about us oh help
[1:07:49] us Lord you know kids can get
[1:07:51] tenderhearted and they get in the
[1:07:52] presence of the Lord and it's just easy
[1:07:54] it seems like standing in that prayer
[1:07:56] line I watch these kids and you probably
[1:07:58] wouldn't believe it what they act like
[1:08:02] you can call them babies you can call
[1:08:03] them whatever well they just don't know
[1:08:05] yet I'm going to just tell you what it
[1:08:06] is it's a spirit of the Lord dealing
[1:08:08] with a tender heart and I think that as
[1:08:10] an adult it would do us good if we just
[1:08:12] have a tender heart again Lord create in
[1:08:15] me a clean heart restore unto me the joy
[1:08:19] of my salvation I'm not trying to make
[1:08:22] you Pentecostal I'm not trying to make
[1:08:24] you run and shout all the time but I'm
[1:08:25] here to tell you if you're not happy
[1:08:27] sitting in the house of God you need the
[1:08:29] joy of your salvation back if you're not
[1:08:31] able to respond to the word of God and
[1:08:33] the house of God then you need a
[1:08:35] refilling of the Holy Ghost at
[1:08:38] least parents we can't our kids probably
[1:08:41] can't live much higher than we are so it
[1:08:44] is our
[1:08:45] responsibility to get those kids here
[1:08:48] and to create an atmosphere in the home
[1:08:51] where they're going to school and if you
[1:08:53] have to send them to public school pray
[1:08:55] for them children yes sir pray before
[1:08:57] they go you may have to pray when they
[1:08:59] get home it's a dark world let's do what
[1:09:02] we can to get our children saved before
[1:09:05] it's too
[1:09:06] late come on well I got faith for them
[1:09:08] they're going to be there cuz my they're
[1:09:09] my kids no I believe that but they have
[1:09:13] to have an experience just like you did
[1:09:15] that's right now I'm going to believe
[1:09:16] that every one of these kids will and I
[1:09:18] believe every one of them here will and
[1:09:20] you got to believe that for your
[1:09:21] children don't ever doubt believe your
[1:09:23] children are going to have that
[1:09:24] experience but they've got to have that
[1:09:27] experience to be in this bride they've
[1:09:29] got to be a holy ghost filed Christian
[1:09:31] but Jesus said you must be born again
[1:09:34] and I've watched some children over the
[1:09:36] weekend get born again and I say it's
[1:09:38] time if you haven't been as an adult get
[1:09:41] born again where we can see a church on
[1:09:43] fire where we can see our young people
[1:09:45] on fire where you can worship without
[1:09:47] restrictions there was a testimony said
[1:09:49] chains were falling well I think there's
[1:09:51] some adults here today that need to see
[1:09:53] some chains falling today we need to get
[1:09:56] back to our first love and realize that
[1:09:58] God is not here to bind you but he's
[1:10:01] here to set you free he's here to give
[1:10:03] freedom of worship he's here to give
[1:10:05] freedom to our young people well come on
[1:10:07] somebody you can sit there and look at
[1:10:09] me but let me just goad and tell you
[1:10:10] like this them young people worshiped
[1:10:12] God last week but if they're looking at
[1:10:14] our elders and there's nothing there but
[1:10:16] just a dead form of godliness then what
[1:10:18] do you expect them to turn out to
[1:10:21] be come
[1:10:23] on well come on it's me I've got to do
[1:10:28] better yes sir come on I've got to do
[1:10:30] better I've got to look in the mirror
[1:10:31] and say how am I going to how am I going
[1:10:33] to act in church today not just to put
[1:10:36] on but am I going to worship with
[1:10:37] everything I got preach come on come on
[1:10:42] that's what you got to do well we're not
[1:10:44] trying to teach our kids to be
[1:10:45] Pentecostals no but they need to know
[1:10:47] that when they come here they can have
[1:10:49] freedom to come and kneel down at an
[1:10:51] altar they can have freedom to raise
[1:10:53] their hands they can have freedom to
[1:10:55] dance if they got to they can have
[1:10:57] freedom to move in the spirit any way
[1:10:59] the spirit moves
[1:11:01] them that's what we need we don't need
[1:11:04] anybody we don't need our kids scared to
[1:11:05] death to raise their hands in church we
[1:11:07] don't need the kids scared to death to
[1:11:09] receive the Holy Ghost because they
[1:11:11] might fall out in the spirit I say let
[1:11:13] them fall out in the spirit I say let
[1:11:15] the Holy Ghost back in the church again
[1:11:17] and put your foot on the head of that
[1:11:19] devil that's trying to hold you back
[1:11:21] that starts at the top and goes all the
[1:11:24] way down that's starts with the parents
[1:11:26] and works right down into the families

[1:13:24] freedom in the house of God it's going
[1:13:26] to take a home that's dedicated to the
[1:13:28] word of God it's going to take a home
[1:13:30] where the parents are not always fussing
[1:13:32] at one another it's going to take a home
[1:13:34] where the spirit of God's got to move
[1:13:36] upon it and create Sons and Daughters of
[1:13:39] God
[1:13:41] absolutely that's what we need well
[1:13:44] you're yelling at me tonight no listen
[1:13:45] listen this what a prophet said come on
[1:13:48] bu he said well he said they he said
[1:13:53] they went up there and W aord he said
[1:13:54] they went up in the upper room oh yeah
[1:13:56] he said they was thanking God for the
[1:13:57] Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost had never come
[1:13:59] yet but they had it in seed form oh yeah
[1:14:03] maybe some of you just got it in seed
[1:14:04] form but you're here waiting on it to
[1:14:07] come to
[1:14:09] maturity he said well he said uh brother
[1:14:12] Brandon we'd like to try to see if an
[1:14:13] acorn would grow down here in our
[1:14:15] backyard he said I'd give you an acorn
[1:14:18] and I'm going to put it in the right
[1:14:19] kind of
[1:14:20] soil just like you got up north and I'm
[1:14:23] going to see if it'll grow and put it in
[1:14:25] this Acorn I give he said brother
[1:14:26] brandom you said that You' give me an
[1:14:28] acorn tree I said well I did I gave you
[1:14:30] the
[1:14:30] acorn he said now you've got the tree oh
[1:14:34] yeah it's in seed form is that right he
[1:14:36] said you've got the tree already it's in
[1:14:37] seed form and Acts 2 verse one says and
[1:14:40] when the day of Pentecost was fully come
[1:14:42] they were all with one Accord in one
[1:14:44] place now there's where we need to be
[1:14:46] yeah come on
[1:14:48] Church how do you you want to you know
[1:14:50] why you know why Youth Camp is so
[1:14:52] effective because a majority of them
[1:14:54] kids are seeking the baptism of the Holy
[1:14:56] Ghost they're there for a purpose now I
[1:14:59] you can say I I'd say 90% I think
[1:15:01] brother Ben told me this too 90% of them
[1:15:03] kids come to that prayer line are not
[1:15:04] coming through for healing they're not
[1:15:06] coming through for they're coming
[1:15:07] through for the Holy Ghost they need the
[1:15:09] Holy Ghost and they recognize they need
[1:15:11] the Holy Ghost that's the first step let
[1:15:13] let's get them to recognize it but in
[1:15:15] verse two and suddenly they were all in
[1:15:17] one Accord and suddenly there came a
[1:15:19] sound from Heaven as of a rushing Mighty
[1:15:21] Wind and it filled all the house where
[1:15:22] they were sitting that's what I want to
[1:15:25] see for our young people when you come
[1:15:27] here and and we got young people sitting
[1:15:29] here on the on the front row I don't
[1:15:31] care if they're five six 7 8 10 11 12
[1:15:36] however young they are they can receive
[1:15:37] the Holy Ghost oh yeah they they can
[1:15:41] receive it but we need to create an
[1:15:43] atmosphere while we're here to say you
[1:15:45] know what if there's children here to
[1:15:47] receive the Holy Ghost let's make it a
[1:15:49] service where they can receive the holy
[1:15:51] ghost that seems simple enough let's not
[1:15:54] just give a our second best when we come
[1:15:56] to the house of God either God is
[1:15:59] everything to me and he is first place
[1:16:02] in my life or he is nothing at all yeah
[1:16:06] come on preach well I'll give him second
[1:16:08] place he'll take what you give him but
[1:16:10] don't expect your kids right to be saved
[1:16:14] like
[1:16:15] that come on got quiet but I'm GNA tell
[1:16:17] you if you live like the world come on
[1:16:20] your kids are probably going to live
[1:16:21] like the
[1:16:23] world if you put
[1:16:25] uh uh let me if sports are a priority
[1:16:28] over church when your kid grows up
[1:16:31] Sports will be a priority over
[1:16:34] Church come on try is that fair
[1:16:38] enough I I if anything is put before
[1:16:41] church when that child grows up in that
[1:16:43] condition who's to blame come on preach
[1:16:48] it's the parent now brother bam talks
[1:16:50] about parent delinquents now I'm not
[1:16:51] trying to hurt you and scold you I'm the
[1:16:53] youngest parent one of the youngest
[1:16:54] parents here you all have done way
[1:16:57] better job and and raised kids for a lot
[1:16:59] longer than I
[1:17:00] have but I think we have enough message
[1:17:03] to show us that we have got to stay with
[1:17:06] the word and keep Christ in the center
[1:17:08] of our life or else we're not we don't
[1:17:10] have a
[1:17:11] chance this is an age of Darkness it's
[1:17:14] only going to get worse it's an age of
[1:17:16] insanity and the only way your children
[1:17:18] have a chance is to keep them in the
[1:17:20] presence of God oh help
[1:17:23] us he said he said' what was it he said
[1:17:26] they all got in one Accord one place
[1:17:27] there was a bless they were blessing God
[1:17:29] for the Holy Ghost which had never come
[1:17:31] yet but they believe that it was because
[1:17:33] God was going to keep his promise how
[1:17:35] many's got a promise here of the Holy
[1:17:36] Ghost how many's been baptized then you
[1:17:39] have a promise of the Holy Ghost and if
[1:17:41] you don't have it I encourage you to
[1:17:43] seek the Holy Ghost with all your heart
[1:17:47] get somewhere and say Lord I'm not going
[1:17:48] to leave until I've got it let's not
[1:17:51] play games with the Holy Ghost but let's
[1:17:53] get the Holy Ghost let's not go be like
[1:17:55] well I don't have it but when it comes
[1:17:57] I'll get it no you need to be earnestly
[1:17:59] contending for the Holy Ghost you need
[1:18:01] to be on your hands and knees day and
[1:18:03] night don't let nothing hinder you from
[1:18:05] getting the Holy Ghost if it's a promise
[1:18:07] you know you can get it now it's time to
[1:18:10] get
[1:18:11] it come on he said you see he said he
[1:18:15] said there come a rushing Mighty Wind
[1:18:16] that filled all the house he said see
[1:18:18] the atmosphere got right oh yeah the
[1:18:21] atmosphere has got to be right for that
[1:18:24] Holy Ghost to sweep over the
[1:18:25] congregation we don't need no fussing
[1:18:27] Among Us or fighting Among Us or or
[1:18:29] somebody coming in with an odd against
[1:18:31] another brother or you come in and say
[1:18:33] well I don't like this one or I don't
[1:18:35] like that one let's come together in
[1:18:36] love believing that our children can
[1:18:39] receive the Holy Ghost and if I need a
[1:18:41] refilling of the Holy Ghost or you need
[1:18:43] a refilling of the Holy Ghost every
[1:18:45] service is an opportunity for you to
[1:18:48] receive that you don't have to wait for
[1:18:50] the meetings in July you don't have to
[1:18:52] wait for your your favorite preacher to
[1:18:54] come through you don't have to wait for
[1:18:56] a camp meeting or a youth camp I want to
[1:18:58] see an atmosphere here where our youth
[1:19:00] can come to this Altar and cry their way
[1:19:03] through I'm not talking about no dryed
[1:19:05] confession I'm talking about a real
[1:19:07] experience with the Holy Ghost it might
[1:19:09] make you slobber a little bit it might
[1:19:11] make you cry it might make you act like
[1:19:13] a fool to the world but it'll do you
[1:19:16] good come
[1:19:19] on we get so scared of the moving of God
[1:19:22] that we call everything fanaticism and
[1:19:24] everything
[1:19:25] is just we're so scared of it that we
[1:19:28] think it's going to cause emotionalism
[1:19:30] in the
[1:19:31] church God
[1:19:32] forbid that we turn out like the old uh
[1:19:36] the oldtime churches that sit there and
[1:19:37] said word only we don't need no more
[1:19:39] spirit I I don't think we need that I
[1:19:41] believe in the word I believe the word
[1:19:43] if it's preached in the power and
[1:19:44] demonstration will create an atmosphere
[1:19:47] where people can be born
[1:19:49] again I think the word is what we need
[1:19:51] but let's put the word in action I've
[1:19:54] been a part of people that put the word
[1:19:56] and they say well here's the word here's
[1:19:57] the word here's the word and they had no
[1:19:58] Spirit to go with it why because they
[1:20:00] were taking what they wanted of the word
[1:20:02] and pushing what they wanted to the word
[1:20:04] but we have the full revealed Vindicated
[1:20:07] word and all we have to do is realize
[1:20:10] that he is here oh thank you brother
[1:20:13] Bram said his ministry was to declare he
[1:20:16] is here oh and if he is here then you
[1:20:19] can receive the Holy Ghost oh yeah you
[1:20:23] elderly people receive the Holy Ghost
[1:20:25] you young people can receive the Holy
[1:20:27] Ghost I can receive a I'll tell you what
[1:20:30] there's many people in here today say
[1:20:32] well I receive the Holy Ghost 20 years
[1:20:33] ago 30 years ago but have you been
[1:20:35] refilled with the Holy Ghost lately
[1:20:38] brother R said there's one filling but
[1:20:39] there's many refilling well I'll tell
[1:20:41] you today I think every one of us
[1:20:43] parents need to check up do I need a
[1:20:45] refilling I say yes Lord I need a
[1:20:48] refilling of the Holy Ghost I would say
[1:20:50] if there was an honest parent in the
[1:20:51] building you would say I need to
[1:20:53] refilling with the Holy Ghost
[1:20:55] well well maybe it's just me but I think
[1:20:58] every one of us parents need to realize
[1:21:00] if these children if they stand a chance
[1:21:02] and lay to see it we got to be holy
[1:21:04] ghost filled Holy Ghost L
[1:21:07] parents oh yes they can go to youth camp
[1:21:10] and get the Holy Ghost but why not let
[1:21:11] them get it right here oh yeah why not
[1:21:14] give everything we've got to every
[1:21:15] service why make them wait till next
[1:21:17] year or the year after or 10 years or
[1:21:20] why not why not tonight why not now why
[1:21:23] can't we let our young people have an
[1:21:25] experience with God you say well I had
[1:21:26] an experience well why don't we let them
[1:21:28] have an
[1:21:29] experience how do I do that brother Joel
[1:21:32] well I think we could have a whole lot
[1:21:34] more encouragement and a little less
[1:21:37] discouragement yeah how do I encourage
[1:21:39] in the house of God by actually showing
[1:21:42] up come on that's your first start it's
[1:21:45] a start if you ain't here the kids ain't
[1:21:49] here brother B said don't send your kids
[1:21:51] to Sunday school said take them
[1:21:55] yeah right that's what he said come on I
[1:21:58] know a prophet that may be too hard for
[1:22:00] some people but that's what a prophet
[1:22:01] said yeah that's what a prophet said
[1:22:03] sorry about all the people on spring
[1:22:04] break I'm not preaching at
[1:22:06] you come on preach when you can be in
[1:22:10] church and you set out it shows that you
[1:22:14] as a parent need the Holy
[1:22:16] Ghost come on preach well that's too
[1:22:19] hard brother Joel it's just the truth
[1:22:21] I'll tell you where I get it from
[1:22:22] Brother Bram said if God is in your
[1:22:24] heart
[1:22:25] yeah you can't wait for them doors to
[1:22:27] open out
[1:22:29] yonder
[1:22:30] now what is God the holy it's the Holy
[1:22:34] Ghost come on it's Christ in you making
[1:22:37] you live the
[1:22:38] word yeah that's right so I think every
[1:22:41] one of us I'm putting my hand up too
[1:22:43] every one of us need to check up say
[1:22:46] Lord what about me oh help us Lord what
[1:22:49] about
[1:22:50] me what am I doing to portray Christ to
[1:22:53] my kids what am I doing to get my kids
[1:22:56] in the presence of God yes I go to
[1:22:58] church but what about my home
[1:23:00] life is it where it needs to
[1:23:02] be just checking up
[1:23:05] here what about you what about me oh my
[1:23:08] brother Joel I this this is not
[1:23:10] preaching me as happy as I wanted well I
[1:23:12] I sometimes we just got to get real oh
[1:23:14] yeah sometimes we just need to know that
[1:23:17] God wants us to be his children he wants
[1:23:21] us to be happy he wants us to he wants
[1:23:24] us to live like children before him but
[1:23:27] you know with condemnation in your heart
[1:23:29] you can't do
[1:23:30] that with condemnation in your heart you
[1:23:34] can't create an atmosphere of worship
[1:23:37] that's right brother B said the
[1:23:39] atmosphere got right he said oh couldn't
[1:23:41] we get an atmosphere here that every
[1:23:43] crippled every blind every sick person
[1:23:47] everything with all with one Accord
[1:23:49] believing until the sick and he said he
[1:23:51] seen it in a meeting he said' I saw it
[1:23:53] in a meeting in Wood River where there
[1:23:54] wasn't one person left they just pulled
[1:23:56] up crutches and Wheelchairs and Cs and
[1:23:58] he said I was standing at the platform
[1:23:59] preaching like this and they just begin
[1:24:01] to raise up he said throw them to the
[1:24:03] corners and the atmosphere got right he
[1:24:06] said oh brother God send us an
[1:24:08] atmosphere here that'll make it of one
[1:24:09] Accord one place he said let the power
[1:24:12] get this part here he said let the power
[1:24:14] of God surge down here through this and
[1:24:16] that atmosphere gets right he said it
[1:24:18] moves back every clog and everything and
[1:24:20] the law of God will move oh come on
[1:24:23] somebody I think that's what we need
[1:24:25] again we don't need to get up here you
[1:24:27] know I I love the Deep preaching of the
[1:24:28] word and I think we need it I think
[1:24:30] it'll bring it it'll bring it'll bring
[1:24:32] good to the church and it'll help you
[1:24:33] grow and it'll feed you but I think
[1:24:36] sometimes we just need to get back to
[1:24:38] the altar again oh yeah do you need an
[1:24:40] altar experience if it's been a while
[1:24:41] I'd say it's time for an altar
[1:24:43] experience again I wonder how many's
[1:24:45] actually kneeled at an altar in this
[1:24:46] generation where they say we don't need
[1:24:48] altars anymore I think we still need
[1:24:50] altars in the churches I think we still
[1:24:52] need to see it can Soul still be saved
[1:24:54] then we need altars in the churches can
[1:24:56] can young people still get the Holy
[1:24:58] Ghost then we need an atmosphere in the
[1:25:00] church can older people still get a
[1:25:02] refilling of the Holy Ghost then we need
[1:25:04] an atmosphere in the church do we still
[1:25:06] need Christ in the church if there's
[1:25:08] still people here seeking Christ we need
[1:25:11] him in the church do we still need
[1:25:14] preachers he said how can they hear
[1:25:15] without a preacher if we need a preacher
[1:25:17] then we still need altars if we still
[1:25:19] need well come on somebody if we still
[1:25:21] need the word preached we still need the
[1:25:23] spirit to water it what we need is to
[1:25:25] get ourselves out of the way not just
[1:25:28] the preacher but every person in the
[1:25:30] congregation get yourselves out of the
[1:25:32] way I'll get myself out of the way and
[1:25:35] watch God move through the church again
[1:25:37] oh
[1:25:38] yeah oh gred Lord what we need is to let
[1:25:42] everything move that is clogged up and
[1:25:45] get back to where the flowing River of
[1:25:48] Life can come through this church and
[1:25:49] and wash out all the the dross and the
[1:25:52] ungodliness and the hate and the
[1:25:53] bitterness right you see what God can do
[1:25:56] for your life the Holy Ghost can take
[1:25:58] you from a bitter person to a loving
[1:26:01] person it can take you from a sick
[1:26:03] person and make you well again it can
[1:26:06] take you from a young person living a
[1:26:07] life of sin to a young person on fire
[1:26:10] for god well how do you know I'm
[1:26:12] watching it unfold before my very eyes
[1:26:14] I've watched young people that have
[1:26:16] never raised their hand in church raise
[1:26:18] their hand in church I've watched young
[1:26:20] people who have never seen Christ a tear
[1:26:23] in church they would almost have to be
[1:26:25] helped out of a prayer line why you say
[1:26:27] that's fanaticism I say it was the Holy
[1:26:29] Ghost moving on our young people and
[1:26:32] it's about time that we had some elderly
[1:26:34] people that would let the Holy Ghost
[1:26:36] move on them as well to where we can
[1:26:38] feel the power of God in our services
[1:26:40] again why it's not just to make me feel
[1:26:42] good or to make you feel good but it's
[1:26:45] to surrender yourself to the moving of
[1:26:47] the Holy
[1:26:49] Spirit well come on somebody what you're
[1:26:51] doing is sitting there saying well he's
[1:26:53] trying to to get an emotional Church
[1:26:55] worked up know what I'm trying to tell
[1:26:57] you is when you find your freedom
[1:26:59] there's none of that push back every
[1:27:00] time you start preaching about things
[1:27:02] that that brother brandom said when you
[1:27:05] start preaching about you know TVs in
[1:27:07] your home taking up too much time and
[1:27:09] brother brandom said we need to put the
[1:27:10] family altar back in it when you start
[1:27:12] getting pushed back from that you
[1:27:14] realize you got some folks that are
[1:27:15] still living in a chicken pin when the
[1:27:18] when the eagle is still screaming and
[1:27:20] trying to tell you come out of that come
[1:27:22] out excuse me come out of that mess come
[1:27:25] out of that ungodliness and live the
[1:27:27] message of the
[1:27:29] hour but what we got to do is you've got
[1:27:32] to get yourself in a position to
[1:27:36] believe and to do that you've got to get
[1:27:38] an atmosphere of
[1:27:41] Freedom yeah how is Christ revealed in
[1:27:44] the right
[1:27:47] atmosphere brother B talks
[1:27:49] about excuse me he said he said he
[1:27:54] Benjamin Benjamin
[1:27:56] Franklin he said here he said Benjamin
[1:27:59] Franklin went fishing with a kite he
[1:28:02] said well lightning run down the string
[1:28:03] and he caught it and he began to run
[1:28:04] holler I got it I got it I got it he had
[1:28:07] it but he didn't know what he had oh my
[1:28:10] that's the matter with our Pentecostal
[1:28:11] church he said you got it but but you
[1:28:14] don't know what you've got he said
[1:28:16] that's it that's right you've got power
[1:28:18] enough to Open the Eyes of the blind
[1:28:20] unstop the ears of the deaf do all the
[1:28:21] things but you come in with a twisted up
[1:28:25] atmosphere well let me read that again
[1:28:28] he said you've got power enough to Open
[1:28:30] the Eyes of the blind you've got power
[1:28:32] enough to unstop ears of the deaf and to
[1:28:35] do all things but you come in with a
[1:28:37] twisted up
[1:28:39] atmosphere he's saying that you can't
[1:28:41] get these things you can't use the power
[1:28:44] that you even have with a twisted up
[1:28:47] atmosphere I say let's get the
[1:28:49] atmosphere right to where the signs and
[1:28:51] wonders can be back in the church again
[1:28:53] amen
[1:28:55] he said he said but you come with a
[1:28:57] twisted up atmosphere he said let's get
[1:28:58] in one Accord so the Holy Spirit can
[1:29:00] pour out the gushers down upon the
[1:29:02] people one place in one Accord I'll
[1:29:05] purpose in my heart that I'll come and
[1:29:07] if there's anything I've got against my
[1:29:09] brother or sister I'm going to get it
[1:29:11] right at the door before I come in here
[1:29:13] and affect a service where our young
[1:29:15] people can't be healed saved and
[1:29:17] delivered I need to get right at the
[1:29:19] door you need to get right at the door
[1:29:22] oh yeah we got to make this place of
[1:29:25] Freedom where chains can fall we're not
[1:29:28] here to bind the people but we want to
[1:29:29] see people set
[1:29:32] free he said he'd sat with a cup of
[1:29:34] coffee and a sandwich all night long and
[1:29:35] he' try this one if the electris would
[1:29:38] or the electric wouldn't follow that
[1:29:39] wire he'd lay it aside and get him
[1:29:41] another one he'd try that until finally
[1:29:42] he found it and he gave the word
[1:29:44] electricity said now he goes on down
[1:29:46] here he said uh he said he was going up
[1:29:49] to happen or something he said these
[1:29:50] monsters something laying up there and
[1:29:52] the electricity is all around you and
[1:29:53] you could scream till you got horse and
[1:29:55] electricity electricity light up and
[1:29:56] show me how to get out of here and he
[1:29:58] said all this stuff and he said I know
[1:30:00] you're here electricity scientifically
[1:30:03] prove that you're here I know you're
[1:30:05] here so light up he said you could
[1:30:07] scream till you got horse and it would
[1:30:09] never light up why electricity will
[1:30:11] light he said light electricity will
[1:30:14] light if you'll follow the law of
[1:30:17] electricity that's right now he's he's
[1:30:19] trying to trying to make a point here
[1:30:21] and he says if you had a fountain over
[1:30:23] on this side of an artisian well gushing
[1:30:25] up and a crop run over on the other side
[1:30:27] burning up he said now you can say oh
[1:30:29] water go over there and irrigate my crop
[1:30:31] it won't do it he said but if you'll
[1:30:33] follow the laws of gravitation then it
[1:30:36] will do
[1:30:37] it you've got to have an atmosphere
[1:30:40] you've got to prepare a place for our
[1:30:43] young people to come and be filled with
[1:30:45] the Holy Ghost why is that because you
[1:30:49] have to get all the unbelief out of your
[1:30:50] life you have to come in here that's why
[1:30:52] you have to repent before your B
[1:30:54] baptized to receive the Holy Ghost if
[1:30:56] you go down a center you come up a wet
[1:30:57] Center a dry Center you come up a wet
[1:30:59] Center what is it because you've got to
[1:31:01] follow the word of God and the way he
[1:31:03] said it but what it is the Holy Ghost is
[1:31:06] not going to come in to an unclean
[1:31:08] vessel but what the young people
[1:31:10] realized was they could sit there and
[1:31:13] they could repent of their sins and they
[1:31:15] could receive the Holy Ghost and they
[1:31:17] were in an atmosphere where it would
[1:31:18] come and they didn't feel condemnation
[1:31:21] for shouting and screaming and crying
[1:31:25] and they shouldn't feel it here
[1:31:29] either because what we need is to create
[1:31:31] a place to where they can come and they
[1:31:35] can feel the presence of God with a
[1:31:37] prayed up parent and a prayed up
[1:31:40] grandparent well come on somebody and
[1:31:42] pray up preachers and pray up song
[1:31:44] leaders and pray up deacons pray up and
[1:31:48] get the channel right to where our young
[1:31:50] people can have a chance at receiving
[1:31:52] the Holy Ghost
[1:31:54] but see it's got to get right here
[1:31:57] before the spirit can come in he said
[1:31:59] you can have the water flowing here but
[1:32:01] you have a crop drying you could have a
[1:32:03] crop over here a crop you could have a
[1:32:06] real seed over here you could have the
[1:32:08] corn growing but it's about to burn up
[1:32:09] why cuz the water can't get to it well
[1:32:12] let's quit holding it up let's unclog
[1:32:14] the channels let's Let the Fire of the
[1:32:16] Holy Ghost move in our church
[1:32:19] again come on let's not hold it back
[1:32:23] let's let God be God when he wants to
[1:32:25] move in the church and and anoint our
[1:32:27] young people with an anointing and I
[1:32:28] tell you what if they run and scream let
[1:32:30] them run and scream you've had your
[1:32:33] Revival let them have their Revival let
[1:32:35] them feel the Holy Ghost move again I
[1:32:37] say it's time you know what if they saw
[1:32:39] us doing it maybe they wouldn't feel so
[1:32:41] bad about doing it but I tell you when
[1:32:43] you know it's the real spirit of God
[1:32:44] they'll break through that and they
[1:32:46] don't care if you sit there and laugh at
[1:32:48] them they're going to run anyway they
[1:32:50] didn't care what people thought of them
[1:32:51] over there in that prayer line they went
[1:32:53] through their receive the Holy Ghost and
[1:32:55] they could care less if you laughed at
[1:32:57] them come on they could care less if you
[1:32:59] called them crazy and fanatical I can I
[1:33:02] you know what I care I can care less
[1:33:05] what people think about preaching the
[1:33:07] message of the hour I I'm not here to
[1:33:09] preach a Baptist sermon to you I'm not
[1:33:12] here to tell you it's okay to live like
[1:33:14] the devil and just go to church I'm here
[1:33:16] to tell you if you get the Holy Ghost
[1:33:18] like they got you'll act like they

[1:34:55] crying out for a refilling of the Holy
[1:34:57] Ghost to where the Holy Ghost can run
[1:34:59] through this church in such a way that
[1:35:01] there could be nothing to stop our young
[1:35:03] people from experiencing other camp
[1:35:05] meeting fire just like they did last
[1:35:08] weekend it don't have to be a camp young

[1:38:04] how that hen will cluck and scratch on
[1:38:06] that manure pile and
[1:38:08] eat and couldn't get the idea yeah you
[1:38:12] just couldn't live like the world even
[1:38:14] though you wanted to right you know when
[1:38:17] before you had the Holy Ghost and you
[1:38:19] could do things that were just
[1:38:21] disgusting you could get on you young

[1:38:25] is nothing new you get on sites you
[1:38:27] shouldn't have got on you see things you
[1:38:28] should have never done but you did it
[1:38:32] and you move on you press towards the
[1:38:34] mark of the High Calling You repent of
[1:38:35] that and move forward don't even think
[1:38:37] about it don't go back to that let the
[1:38:40] Holy Ghost change you and forget about
[1:38:41] it it's not say well that's holding me
[1:38:43] back well just forget about it move
[1:38:46] on you say well you know how could I
[1:38:49] ever be a preacher like that well I I'll

[1:38:53] that have had that problem too yeah come
[1:38:55] on come on somebody come on all your
[1:38:57] Halos are about half burned out already
[1:38:59] might as well just go ahead and let them
[1:39:01] take them off really I think about it
[1:39:03] you can say well I've done this I quit
[1:39:05] looking to your past quit looking to
[1:39:07] what you did did you get the Holy Ghost
[1:39:09] it'll change you and make you
[1:39:12] new but this little ugly duckling or
[1:39:17] Eagle I was read a lot of bedtime
[1:39:19] stories as a
[1:39:22] child they wanted me to know what I was
[1:39:27] like this was you
[1:39:30] Joel with the ugly
[1:39:32] one he was the ugly one among them
[1:39:34] because he couldn't understand anyway
[1:39:36] she would say come on over and feast
[1:39:39] honey come on over here and eat this
[1:39:42] garbage yeah eat out of this you ever
[1:39:45] been in a chicken coop anybody oh yeah
[1:39:48] it's a it's a pretty nasty place and
[1:39:50] they eat in there you just throw the
[1:39:52] corn in on the ground and just let him
[1:39:54] eat right on top of
[1:39:56] the just like
[1:39:58] that just like that well praise the Lord
[1:40:02] and so they would cluck along and eat
[1:40:04] and the little Eagle just couldn't do
[1:40:07] it and didn't look right to him so one
[1:40:09] day his mam came hunting him and he
[1:40:12] would hear that hin cluck and he would
[1:40:14] try his best to cluck but he couldn't do
[1:40:17] it he tried to cheap like a chicken but
[1:40:20] he couldn't do
[1:40:22] it he was an
[1:40:24] eagle before you young people ever got
[1:40:27] the Holy Ghost to Camp there was a
[1:40:29] desire on the inside of you to get the
[1:40:31] Holy
[1:40:32] Ghost you were an eagle before you ever
[1:40:34] went to camp but you went over there and
[1:40:37] realized hey I don't have to be like
[1:40:40] that
[1:40:42] anymore oh thank you Lord one day his
[1:40:44] mommy flew flew over flew over and she
[1:40:47] screamed and he recognized it you
[1:40:50] recognized the call oh thank you Lord I
[1:40:54] I read this and I thought about camp now
[1:40:56] I'm just weird like that but that's the
[1:40:59] way it
[1:41:01] is it sounded right oh yes why he was an
[1:41:06] eagle to begin with that's the way it is
[1:41:08] with the gospel or the word or the power
[1:41:09] of Jesus Christ when a man has been
[1:41:11] predestinated to eternal life he hears
[1:41:14] that true scream of God and nothing can
[1:41:17] keep him from it the church might say
[1:41:19] days of Miracles has passed cluck cluck
[1:41:21] cluck stand here and eat this and stand
[1:41:23] here and eat that that barnyard stuff
[1:41:25] won't do for him anymore he is gone all
[1:41:28] things are possible he gets off the
[1:41:30] ground that's why that's the matter
[1:41:32] that's what's the matter with so many
[1:41:33] Christians today they can't get their
[1:41:35] feet off the ground the old mommy said
[1:41:37] Son jump you're an eagle come up here
