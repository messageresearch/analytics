[35:47] just why he came [music and singing]
[35:51] to love.
[35:53] Aren't you glad he did it for you?
[35:56] He looked beyond [singing]
[36:01] all my faults and he saw
[36:05] my needs.
[36:08] Let it ring out now. I shall [singing]
[36:12] forever [music]
[36:17] my eyes [music and singing]
[36:19] to Calary.
[36:24] Oh to him the cross [music]
[36:30] where Jesus
[36:32] died for me.
[36:39] How long
[36:43] so grace [music and singing]
[36:45] that
[36:47] I fall
[36:49] soul.
[36:52] He looked beyond
[36:57] all my faults and he saw
[37:02] my needs. It was God's grace.
[37:06] It was God's grace
[37:12] that [singing] brought me out
[37:15] of darkness
[37:20] into
[37:22] the light [singing]
[37:26] where I can clearly
[37:30] see.
[37:34] I'll [singing] shout [music]
[37:36] it in front
[37:40] of the [singing] mountains
[37:42] and the valley
[37:48] and he [singing and music] looked
[37:50] beyond
[37:53] all my faults and he saw.
[37:58] If he did it for you, let me hear you
[37:59] sing it now.
[38:02] Well, I shall forever
[38:08] lift my eyes [music and singing]
[38:11] to Calary
[38:15] to [singing and music] him
[38:25] for
[38:27] all to me.
[38:30] [music] How marvelous. [singing]
[38:34] Oh, the grace of God [music]
[38:38] my falling
[38:41] soul.
[38:44] He looked [singing]
[38:45] me all. Aren't you glad he did tonight?
[38:49] My fault said he saw
[38:53] my need.
[38:57] Let's bow our heads together for a word
[38:59] of prayer. There's a special need
[39:01] tonight you'd like to make known by
[39:02] lifting your hand. I know that he sees
[39:05] it tonight and he knows all about it.
[39:09] Heavenly Father, you see these hands
[39:12] that are raised, Lord, and they didn't
[39:13] do that just by habit, but it was some
[39:16] need that they had in their life. And
[39:19] Lord, I ask you to meet that need.
[39:21] Father, ask you to come and just speak
[39:25] directly to them tonight, Lord. We know
[39:27] a word from you is better than even a
[39:30] material blessing, Lord. Cuz when we
[39:33] hear your word, we know that the
[39:35] blessing's on the way, Lord. and the
[39:38] promise is as good to us as having Lord
[39:41] the fulfillment right among us. We thank
[39:43] you for that Lord. I pray that you'd
[39:46] move tonight. I pray you'd move me out
[39:47] of the way. Meet every need. We pray.
[39:51] Pray that you'd heal the sick. Your
[39:52] presence would be with us, Lord, to meet
[39:55] every need. We pray in Jesus name. Amen.
[40:00] Amen. God bless you. Turn with me to
[40:02] Ephesians chapter 2:es 8-10.
[40:06] Good to have each and every one of you
[40:07] with us tonight.
[40:09] Ephesians 2 8-10.
[40:13] Didn't you enjoy the services Sunday? I
[40:15] just feel a very special blessing from
[40:18] the Lord is on its way and it's already
[40:20] here and so thankful to feel a spirit of
[40:23] revival among us. We don't want to ever
[40:24] let that die. We want to stay in revival
[40:27] all of the time. Brother Brandham said,
[40:28] "Whatever you do, keep yourself in the
[40:31] life of Christ." That's what we want to
[40:33] do. Amen. Ephesians chapter 2 and verse
[40:36] 8,
[40:38] Paul says, and we'll read down through
[40:40] verse 10 and then read the rest uh uh
[40:44] after you're seated. Verse eight, for by
[40:47] grace are you saved through faith and
[40:49] that not of yourselves. It is the gift
[40:53] of God, not of works, lest any man
[40:56] should boast. For we are his
[41:00] workmanship.
[41:02] So it's like he is the architect and we
[41:05] are the building created in Christ Jesus
[41:10] unto good works which God hath before
[41:14] ordained that we should walk in them. I
[41:18] pray the Lord would add his blessing to
[41:19] the word. You may be seated this
[41:21] evening.
[41:25] I don't know about having a preacher on
[41:26] the back row back there.
[41:30] Okay, we got two preachers on the back
[41:31] row. My goodness.
[41:34] Glad you're all here tonight. Thank you
[41:35] for being here.
[41:37] In Ephesians chapter 2, starting in
[41:40] verse 8, Paul deals with uh grace and
[41:44] says you are saved through faith by
[41:48] grace and that it is a gift of God that
[41:51] we can't work towards that. There's
[41:53] nothing we could do to earn it. He said,
[41:55] "And we have nothing to boast in." And
[41:58] then he goes on to say that we are his
[42:00] workmanship. So he doesn't leave it in a
[42:02] sense of, "Well, there's nothing I can
[42:04] do, so I'll just let him do everything."
[42:07] But he says we were ordained to good
[42:09] works. So [snorts] we are not to just
[42:11] stay in our uh secure in our election,
[42:15] but our election is also a an election
[42:18] to good works. It's a predestination to
[42:21] adoption as we've talked about. So, we
[42:24] are what he Christ has built. Now, I
[42:28] want to go somewhere tonight. I know
[42:29] some of you sitting there say, "Well,
[42:30] he's on Ephesians again." And but
[42:33] there's some place I want to go tonight
[42:34] that I believe the Lord put on my heart
[42:36] for us as a church. So, we are what he
[42:40] has built. Now, go to verse 11. And it
[42:43] says, "Wherefore remember that you being
[42:45] in time past Gentiles in the flesh, who
[42:48] are called uncircumcision by that which
[42:50] is called the circumcision, in the flesh
[42:52] made by hands, that at that time you
[42:55] were without Christ, being aliens from
[42:57] the commonwealth of Israel, strangers
[42:59] from the covenants of promise, having no
[43:01] hope, without God in the world." So he's
[43:04] placing us as Gentiles outside the
[43:06] promise. He said, "But now in Christ
[43:10] Jesus, ye who sometimes were far off are
[43:14] made nigh by the blood of Christ." So he
[43:16] says, "We were made uh uh partakers of
[43:19] the promise with the with Israel." He
[43:22] said, "And for he is our peace who have
[43:26] made both one and broken down the middle
[43:29] wall of partition between us." So we
[43:31] should not think of the gentile church
[43:34] as being separate from the Jewish church
[43:37] in the sense of whatever prom he
[43:39] promised to the Jews in shadow comes to
[43:43] us in a reality.
[43:44] &gt;&gt; So we are not just a new testament
[43:47] church. We are a new testament church
[43:49] but we are believers in the old and the
[43:51] new testament. All of the old testament
[43:54] promises
[43:55] also apply to the bride. Not in a
[43:59] natural way, but in a spiritual way. So
[44:02] he says he's broke down the middle wall
[44:03] of partition between us, having
[44:05] abolished in his flesh the enmity, even
[44:07] the law of commandments contained in
[44:09] ordinances for to making himself of
[44:11] twain or of two one new man, so making
[44:14] peace. and that he might reconcile both
[44:17] unto God in one body by the cross,
[44:20] having slain the enmity thereby, and
[44:23] came and preached peace to you which
[44:25] were a far off, and to them which are
[44:27] that were nigh. For through him we both
[44:30] have access by one spirit to the father.
[44:33] Now, this is important. Paul's not just
[44:35] taking up space in the book of Ephesians
[44:38] to tell us this. It's important because
[44:40] the Gentiles again are not to think of
[44:42] themselves as separate from the
[44:44] promises, but fellow heirs of the
[44:47] promises. Are you with me so far? He
[44:50] said, "Now therefore, you're no more,"
[44:51] one of you are. "Therefore, you're no
[44:53] more strangers and foreigners, but
[44:55] fellow citizens with the saints and of
[44:58] the household of God." Notice how he
[45:00] terms it. You're fellow citizens. You're
[45:02] part of the household of God. He said,
[45:05] "And are built, now notice this verse,
[45:08] upon the foundation of the apostles and
[45:11] prophets." So we are not built
[45:13] separately from the Old Testament
[45:16] prophets or the promises of the Old
[45:19] Testament, but we are actually built on
[45:21] top of the Old Testament. So he says,
[45:24] "You are built on the foundation of the
[45:26] apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ
[45:28] himself
[45:30] being the chief cornerstone
[45:33] &gt;&gt; in whom all the building fitly framed
[45:36] together." So we're part of the
[45:38] building. Israel's part of the building.
[45:40] He said, "Groweth unto a holy temple in
[45:43] the Lord, in whom you also are builded
[45:46] together for a habitation of God through
[45:49] the spirit." So he's placing you as part
[45:51] of his building. Part of his building.
[45:53] You say, "Well, he said the foundation
[45:56] was the apostles and prophets." But did
[45:57] you know that you are also a part of the
[46:00] foundation?
[46:02] How many knew that?
[46:03] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham taught that in uh in
[46:06] the church age book and in in the church
[46:08] ages when he taught uh I believe it's
[46:10] from the Philadelphiaian church age,
[46:11] Revelation 3:12, it said, "Him that
[46:14] overcomemeth will I make a pillar in the
[46:15] temple of my God." A pillar. I'm going
[46:18] to make him a pillar. A pillar is part
[46:20] of the foundation. But the bride said
[46:22] he's not only giving crowns, but he says
[46:24] that these in the bride will be made
[46:27] pillars in the temple of God. You ever
[46:29] heard somebody say, "Well, that brother
[46:30] is a pillar in the church or that sister
[46:32] is a pillar in the church." Well,
[46:34] actually, all the saints of God are to
[46:37] be pillars in the house of God.
[46:40] &gt;&gt; Right? So, brother Brandham said Jesus
[46:42] spoke of his body as being the temple.
[46:44] It was it was the temple of God. He
[46:46] said, ' But now that we are his body,
[46:47] the true church is the temple of God by
[46:50] the Holy Ghost within us. He said, 'Now
[46:53] he's going to make the overcomer. How
[46:55] many overcomers do we have here tonight?
[46:57] Uh we're all going to have to be
[46:58] overcomers to make it out of this world.
[47:01] So if we're an overcomer, we are
[47:02] actually a pillar in the temple of God.
[47:06] He said, what is a pillar? He said, a
[47:08] pillar is actually a part of the
[47:11] foundation. He said, for it holds up the
[47:14] superructure. So, he's not just going to
[47:16] put the apostles and the prophets there,
[47:18] but he's going to put us there with
[47:20] them. Brother Brandham said it puts us
[47:22] right in with the apostles and the
[47:25] prophets. And he references Ephesians
[47:27] 2:19. And through 22, he said, "Yes,
[47:30] that verse 22 says we're builded
[47:32] together with them." He said,
[47:34] "Everything went through the door Jesus
[47:36] and is a part of that body or temple."
[47:38] He said, "Now when God puts a man in the
[47:40] temple as a pillar and makes him a part
[47:43] of that foundation group,
[47:46] that's good. That's better than what we
[47:48] realize it is." He said, "He's making
[47:49] him a part of the foundation group."
[47:54] &gt;&gt; Right? So, it's not just a prophet. It's
[47:55] not just an apostle, but he said, "I
[47:57] want to make the overcomer
[47:59] &gt;&gt; a part of the foundation." Did you
[48:01] realize, brother Peter, you're a part of
[48:03] the foundation? Right? You young people,
[48:05] you're to be a part of the foundation.
[48:07] The overcomer is to be a part of the
[48:11] foundation group. He said what is he
[48:13] doing? He is giving him the revelation
[48:16] of the word and of himself because that
[48:19] is exactly what the apostles and
[48:20] prophets had. Matthew 16:17 he said
[48:24] there he is in that word. There he
[48:26] stands. No one I like that. No one can
[48:30] get him out.
[48:32] &gt;&gt; Why? I'M PART OF THE FOUNDATION. SO I'M
[48:34] NOT SEPARATE from what the Old Testament
[48:36] teaches. I'm not separate from what the
[48:38] New Testament teaches. It's not a new
[48:40] religion. It's a Bible-based religion.
[48:43] Brother said, "It's a new case of old
[48:45] religion."
[48:46] &gt;&gt; Right? And so, we're a part of if this
[48:48] is the foundation, I'm part of it.
[48:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We're to be pillars in the
[48:54] house of God. Listen, WE CAN'T LIVE OUR
[48:56] LIVES SEPARATE from the scriptures. We
[48:59] can't live OUR LIVES SEPARATE FROM THE
[49:01] MESSAGE
[49:02] &gt;&gt; because the foundation was planted AND
[49:04] AND GOD'S PROPHET COME TO TAKE US BACK
[49:07] TO THE FOUNDATION. SO WE CAN'T BE
[49:09] something different from that. WE'RE TO
[49:11] BE A PILLAR in that. SO WE SHOULDN'T SHY
[49:14] AWAY FROM THE TEACHINGS OF THE MESSAGE.
[49:16] WE SHOULDN'T RUN AWAY FROM THE THINGS
[49:17] THAT ARE DIFFICULT to understand or
[49:20] maybe difficult to live or maybe we
[49:22] think, well, I I I know what brother
[49:23] Brandon taught, but I don't really want
[49:24] to do it that way. Listen, we want to be
[49:26] a pillar in the temple of God. We want
[49:29] all the blessings of God. We want access
[49:31] to all the things that God has.
[49:34] &gt;&gt; He said, "You're not separate from them.
[49:36] &gt;&gt; You're a part of them."
[49:39] &gt;&gt; Do you understand so far?
[49:41] &gt;&gt; Now, so the apostles and prophets of the
[49:44] foundation, Matthew 5:17,
[49:47] Jesus said, "Think not that I am come to
[49:50] destroy the law or the prophets. I am
[49:53] not come to destroy but to fulfill."
[49:57] That's right.
[49:58] &gt;&gt; For verily I say unto you, till heaven
[50:00] and earth pass one jot or one tit shall
[50:04] in no wise pass from the law. He said
[50:06] not even the punctuation
[50:08] &gt;&gt; shall pass from the law till all be
[50:11] fulfilled.
[50:13] &gt;&gt; So he was actually not separate from the
[50:16] word. He was the word.
[50:19] &gt;&gt; Right? He didn't just come anyway he
[50:20] wanted to. He come according to the
[50:22] word.
[50:23] &gt;&gt; The word said he would be born in
[50:24] Bethlehem. Right? He's the chief
[50:27] cornerstone of the the scriptures. I I
[50:30] know I'm laboring in this tonight, but I
[50:32] want us to just uh get it really good. I
[50:35] want us to understand that we're part of
[50:36] that foundation. He said uh brother
[50:39] Brandham said therefore knowing these
[50:41] things he said maybe he said maybe you
[50:43] don't know them my brethren but knowing
[50:45] these things he said I'm constrained
[50:48] and duty bound to GOD TO CARRY OUT THE
[50:52] plan of the first foundation because no
[50:56] other man can lay any other foundation
[51:00] than that which already laid. So if
[51:02] anybody wants to come and build a
[51:04] different way than what's already been
[51:06] built, he can't do that, right? I can't
[51:10] do that. No other preacher can do that.
[51:12] A prophet couldn't even do that. He had
[51:13] to build on the foundation of the
[51:16] apostles and prophets.
[51:18] &gt;&gt; So, and I want us to think practically
[51:21] about this tonight. I want us to think
[51:23] about it, examine ourselves and say,
[51:25] Lord, am I built on the foundation? Not
[51:28] only my church, you know, you want to go
[51:29] to a church that's that's based on the
[51:31] foundation of the scriptures, but am I
[51:34] basing my own life on the foundation of
[51:36] the scriptures?
[51:38] &gt;&gt; Do I know the scriptures well enough to
[51:41] know IF I'M BEING TAUGHT according to
[51:43] the foundation?
[51:45] &gt;&gt; Do I know the message well enough to
[51:47] know how what I should be doing and how
[51:49] I should be acting and and what I should
[51:52] be and what our families ought to be and
[51:53] what our church ought to be. I think we
[51:55] ought to I think we ought to pray for
[51:57] revelation every hour of our life more
[51:59] than we pray for anything else. Lord
[52:01] reveal to me my place in the body of
[52:04] Christ.
[52:08] &gt;&gt; He said he said he said no other man can
[52:12] lay any other foundation that which is
[52:15] already laid. That's the apostles and
[52:17] the prophets. The prophets foretold it
[52:19] and the apostles carried it out
[52:22] &gt;&gt; and we're supposed to keep on carrying
[52:24] it
[52:25] &gt;&gt; till the buildings completed.
[52:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:30] &gt;&gt; This is our foundation.
[52:33] &gt;&gt; Paul says, as we said before, so say I
[52:35] now again, if any man preach any other
[52:37] gospel unto you than that you have
[52:39] received
[52:41] than than the foundation, let him be
[52:44] accursed.
[52:45] So again, just to kind of go back over
[52:48] it, we don't exist as strangers to the
[52:50] covenants. Aren't you glad you're not a
[52:52] stranger to the covenant when it comes
[52:54] to healing?
[52:56] &gt;&gt; Right? See, so the modern church would
[52:57] teach that you're a stranger to the
[52:59] covenant, that healing ceased with the
[53:01] apostles, miracles ceased with the
[53:03] apostles. But you're not a stranger to
[53:04] what the apostles and the prophets had.
[53:07] &gt;&gt; You're not a stranger to uh to a Holy
[53:10] Ghost move. You're not a stranger to
[53:12] acts to experience. You're not a strange
[53:14] a stranger to being led by the Holy
[53:16] Ghost.
[53:17] &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? You're not a
[53:19] stranger to these things, but you're
[53:21] built on the foundation. You're a pillar
[53:23] in the temple, a fellow citizen in the
[53:25] city of God, in the kingdom of God. We
[53:28] build our life by the foundation of the
[53:32] word and on the foundation of the word.
[53:35] If you try to build off the foundation,
[53:37] your building will fall.
[53:41] &gt;&gt; Right? So, we need to reorder our
[53:44] thoughts and how we think about things,
[53:48] &gt;&gt; right? We think about our jobs
[53:51] through a scriptural lens.
[53:53] &gt;&gt; We think about our church through a
[53:56] scriptural lens.
[53:58] &gt;&gt; We think about our uh we think about our
[54:01] uh our lives, our marriages, our love
[54:05] life,
[54:07] if you will, through a spiritual lens.
[54:12] We think about who we will marry. We
[54:13] think about WE THINK ABOUT HOW WE WILL
[54:15] CONDUCT OUR our homes
[54:19] &gt;&gt; through the lens of the scripture.
[54:21] &gt;&gt; I'm taking it slow for a reason tonight.
[54:23] I just want us to really understand
[54:24] this. See, if you try to build off the
[54:27] foundation, your building's got to fall.
[54:31] &gt;&gt; In Matthew chapter 7, you can go read
[54:33] the whole thing later, but in Matthew
[54:35] chapter 7, uh Paul or Jesus talks about
[54:38] false prophets. He said, "Beware of
[54:40] false prophets." And he said, "Not
[54:42] everyone that says, "Lord, Lord," will
[54:44] enter the kingdom.
[54:45] &gt;&gt; And he says, "You'll know them by their
[54:47] fruits." Brother man said that was their
[54:48] teaching.
[54:50] &gt;&gt; And in Matthew 7:24, he goes on and
[54:53] continues that thought and says this,
[54:54] "Therefore, whosoever heareth these
[54:56] sayings of mine and doeth them," if
[54:59] you've got a if you underline, if you
[55:00] mark in your Bible, underline that. If
[55:02] you're taking notes, write it down.
[55:04] Whoever hears it and does it, not just
[55:07] hears it, but hears it and does it. He
[55:09] said, 'I will liken him to a wise man.
[55:12] How many of you young people, young men,
[55:14] you want to be a wise man? Nobody wants
[55:17] to There's one on the front. You want to
[55:19] be a wise man? If you want to be a wise
[55:21] man, build your life on the word.
[55:27] &gt;&gt; That's the only wisdom that we that we
[55:28] want is the wisdom of the word. So the
[55:31] wise man built his house on a rock and
[55:34] the rains came because they will come,
[55:37] &gt;&gt; right?
[55:39] &gt;&gt; The floods came because floods will
[55:41] come,
[55:42] &gt;&gt; right?
[55:43] &gt;&gt; The winds blew because the wind will
[55:45] blow and beat upon that house and it
[55:47] fell not for it was founded on a
[55:51] foundation
[55:52] &gt;&gt; on a rock. And everyone that heareth
[55:55] these sayings of mine, and doeth them
[55:57] not, shall be likened unto a foolish
[56:00] man, which built his house on sand. And
[56:05] the rain descended, and the floods came,
[56:08] and the winds blew, and beat upon that
[56:11] house, and it fell, and great was the
[56:14] fall of it.
[56:15] &gt;&gt; When you see something fall,
[56:18] &gt;&gt; it wasn't built on the foundation.
[56:22] &gt;&gt; It might look good. Come on.
[56:24] &gt;&gt; It It might have the most impressive
[56:27] doors and windows and roof that you've
[56:29] ever seen. But when the winds come and
[56:32] it falls,
[56:34] it wasn't built on the right foundation.
[56:36] But when you see somebody,
[56:38] though they have loss in their family,
[56:40] though they go through struggle, though
[56:42] they have financial trouble,
[56:44] &gt;&gt; somebody testify with me tonight.
[56:46] Brother Joel was talking to some of you
[56:48] personally SUNDAY NIGHT AND SAYING WHAT
[56:50] GOD HAD DONE AND YET some of the things
[56:51] that you'd been through and yet some of
[56:53] the testimonies that we have that the
[56:55] reason you came through it, the reason
[56:57] you're here tonight, the reason that you
[56:59] made it IS BECAUSE YOU BUILT YOUR LIFE
[57:01] ON THE WORD, YOU DECIDED WHEN EVERYBODY
[57:04] ELSE WASN'T GOING TO GO TO CHURCH, I'M
[57:05] GOING TO GO TO CHURCH. WHEN EVERYBODY
[57:07] ELSE IS NOT GOING TO LIVE ACCORDING TO
[57:09] THE MESSAGE OF THE HOUR, I'M GOING TO
[57:10] LIVE ACCORDING TO THE MESSAGE. I'M GOING
[57:12] TO DO WHAT'S RIGHT. NO MATTER WHAT
[57:14] ANYBODY ELSE DOES, IT PAYS TO BUILD ON
[57:17] the rock.
[57:20] &gt;&gt; Build it now. Don't wait till you're old
[57:22] TO BUILD IT. YOU YOUNG PEOPLE, START
[57:24] YOUR FAMILIES ON THE ROCK. START YOUR
[57:26] JOB ON THE ROCK. START YOUR CAREERS ON
[57:28] THE ROCK. IF THE LORD CARRIES AND YOU
[57:30] BECOME A PREACHER OR A SONG LEADER OR or
[57:33] a deacon OR A TRUSTEE, BUILD IT ON THE
[57:35] ROCK.
[57:36] &gt;&gt; And you won't HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT
[57:38] FALLING when temptation comes. That's
[57:41] right.
[57:41] &gt;&gt; The rains come and the floods come.
[57:45] &gt;&gt; We don't build our lives or our families
[57:48] or the church on the foundation of our
[57:50] opinions.
[57:52] &gt;&gt; Right.
[57:54] &gt;&gt; Right.
[57:55] &gt;&gt; We don't build on feelings.
[57:58] &gt;&gt; Good.
[58:00] &gt;&gt; Don't build a marriage on feelings.
[58:02] Don't build a church on feelings. Don't
[58:04] don't conduct your life by how you feel
[58:08] &gt;&gt; because the devil will get into that.
[58:10] Yeah,
[58:11] &gt;&gt; we don't build on emotion. We build on
[58:14] the foundation of the apostles and
[58:16] prophets. And then if and then if you
[58:19] build it that way, there'll be some
[58:20] feeling to your worship
[58:22] &gt;&gt; because your life is built on the word.
[58:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Ram says in every age it
[58:28] was the same cry. Hear what the spirit
[58:32] says.
[58:33] &gt;&gt; He that hath an ear, let him hear.
[58:35] That's right.
[58:36] &gt;&gt; If you're a Christian, YOU WILL GET BACK
[58:38] TO what the spirit is teaching. That is
[58:40] the word of this age. Every messenger to
[58:43] every age will preach that word. Every.
[58:46] Someone say every. Every fresh and true
[58:49] revival. Do you want a revival today? Do
[58:52] you WANT A PERSONAL REVIVAL? DO YOU WANT
[58:54] A WORD REVIVAL? DO YOU WANT A FRESH AND
[58:56] TRUE REVIVAL? EVERY FRESH and true
[58:59] revival. Everyone will be BECAUSE MEN
[59:02] HAVE GOTTEN BACK TO THE WORD FOR THEIR
[59:04] AGE. OH, LET ME GET BACK TO THE WORD.
[59:06] LET ME BUILD ON THE RIGHT FOUNDATION.
[59:10] &gt;&gt; DO IT WHILE YOU'RE STARTING OUT. DON'T
[59:11] WAIT TILL LATER. DON'T DON'T GO OUT AND
[59:13] SEW YOUR WILD O SAY, "WELL, I'll do
[59:14] that." No, THAT THAT'S GOING TO CAUSE
[59:16] HARM TO YOUR FOUNDATION. BUILD RIGHT NOW
[59:19] ON THE FOUNDATION OF THE WORD.
[59:22] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[59:25] &gt;&gt; BUILD. NOW, you say, "Well, I'm older
[59:27] and I didn't build on the foundation."
[59:28] But you can start BUILDING RIGHT NOW. GO
[59:30] BACK TO THE foundation and make sure
[59:32] that you know where you stand in the
[59:34] word.
[59:35] &gt;&gt; Right?
[59:36] &gt;&gt; People make big decisions in life
[59:38] without really knowing what the
[59:39] foundation is
[59:41] &gt;&gt; and that's when they fall.
[59:45] &gt;&gt; Look, brother Brandon said the cry of
[59:47] every age.
[59:49] That's the cry of this age is the
[59:51] rebuke. You have left the word of God.
[59:53] Repent and come back to the word. From
[59:56] the first book in the Bible, Genesis, to
[59:58] the last book, Revelation, there's only
[59:59] one reason for God's displeasure,
[1:00:01] leaving the word. And there's only one
[1:00:03] remedy to regain his favor, back to the
[1:00:05] word.
[1:00:07] &gt;&gt; See, a true prophet leads the people
[1:00:08] back to the foundation. What did Elijah
[1:00:11] do when he went to build the altar,
[1:00:13] repair the altar of the Lord? He looked
[1:00:15] FOR WHERE IT ALREADY HAD BEEN. IT WAS
[1:00:17] TORE DOWN. THERE MAY NOT HAVE BEEN A
[1:00:18] STONE LEFT ON IT, BUT HE WENT AND FOUND
[1:00:20] THE FOUNDATION OF THE SAME ALTAR AND
[1:00:22] BUILT IN THE SAME SPOT
[1:00:25] &gt;&gt; AND REPAIRED THE altar of the Lord. HE
[1:00:27] DIDN'T BUILD A NEW ONE. HE REPAIRED THE
[1:00:28] ALTAR OF THE LORD. HE WAS TURNING THE
[1:00:30] HEARTS OF THE FATHERS to the children.
[1:00:32] AND TODAY THERE'S A HEART OF THE
[1:00:33] CHILDREN TURNED BACK TO THE FATHERS
[1:00:35] BECAUSE ELIJAH WENT AND FOUND THE
[1:00:36] FOUNDATION by the leadership of the Holy
[1:00:38] Ghost.
[1:00:39] &gt;&gt; HE WENT AND FOUND THE FOUNDATION. AND IF
[1:00:41] HE FOUND THE FOUNDATION, LET ME BUILD
[1:00:44] WHATEVER PART THAT I HAVE TO PLAY.
[1:00:45] WHATEVER PART I HAVE AS A PASTOR,
[1:00:47] WHATEVER PART WE HAVE AS A CHURCH, LET
[1:00:49] US BUILD ON THIS SAME FOUNDATION. WE'RE
[1:00:51] NOT SEPARATE. THIS ISN'T A CULT. IT'S
[1:00:53] NOT SOME TYPE OF GROUP WHERE WE CAN JUST
[1:00:55] DO our own thing, BUT WE ARE BUILDING ON
[1:00:57] THE FOUNDATION of the word.
[1:01:01] &gt;&gt; So if the early church had healing, we
[1:01:03] want healing.
[1:01:04] &gt;&gt; If the early church had miracles, we
[1:01:06] want miracles. If the early church went
[1:01:08] to church, we want to go to church.
[1:01:10] Amen.
[1:01:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:01:15] Well, back to the word. Any doctrine
[1:01:17] built off the foundation is false.
[1:01:20] &gt;&gt; In fact, the Catholic Church, Brother
[1:01:21] Brandon said that beast come out of the
[1:01:23] bottomless pit because he said the
[1:01:25] bottomless pit had no foundation to it.
[1:01:27] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:01:28] &gt;&gt; It had no basis in the word.
[1:01:32] So, Brother Brandham said, "We've taught
[1:01:34] them off of the foundation of the faith
[1:01:36] that was once delivered to the
[1:01:37] Pentecostal fathers." Yeah. He said,
[1:01:39] "The Bible taught a false purgatory,
[1:01:43] taught a false baptism, everything
[1:01:45] false, false, false, separating from the
[1:01:47] original." He said, "You don't believe
[1:01:48] it? Come back to the Bible. Take your
[1:01:50] purgatory. Take your father, son, holy
[1:01:52] ghost, and sprinkling and all that
[1:01:53] stuff. Come back. See if it's
[1:01:54] scriptural."
[1:01:56] &gt;&gt; Huh? Take return ministry.
[1:02:00] &gt;&gt; Take
[1:02:03] I'm gonna get in trouble. Take your
[1:02:04] thunders,
[1:02:05] &gt;&gt; right? Take it back to the Bible. what
[1:02:08] you believe about the message,
[1:02:10] &gt;&gt; your personal opinion,
[1:02:13] &gt;&gt; about how you should live or what you
[1:02:14] should do, take it back to the word,
[1:02:17] &gt;&gt; right? Run it through the Bible. And he
[1:02:20] said, and come back, see if it's
[1:02:21] scriptural. That's the way. Find out if
[1:02:22] it's on the foundation. See, they're off
[1:02:23] of the foundation, which Paul said, the
[1:02:25] church of God is founded upon the
[1:02:27] doctrine of the apostles and prophets.
[1:02:29] The prophets and apostles has to be the
[1:02:30] same. Sure. What he said? We went off of
[1:02:32] that foundation of the word to
[1:02:33] denominational foundations. off of the
[1:02:36] foundation of the word onto the
[1:02:37] foundation of worldly pleasure,
[1:02:39] worldliness, immoral creeping into the
[1:02:41] church. I I know this is heavy for a
[1:02:43] Wednesday night, but just hang with me
[1:02:44] for a minute. He said off the word onto
[1:02:47] creeds. He said there ain't but one
[1:02:48] thing. Come right back where it left off
[1:02:50] and go again. If you've left the
[1:02:52] foundation, HE SAID COME BACK TO WHERE
[1:02:54] IT LEFT OFF.
[1:02:56] &gt;&gt; Go again. Come back to the word. That's
[1:02:58] right. Repent means to go turn back
[1:03:00] ABOUT FACE. YOU'RE GOING the wrong way.
[1:03:02] Yeah,
[1:03:04] &gt;&gt; I'm so thankful that if you need to
[1:03:06] repent if you're if you didn't build on
[1:03:08] the foundation, but if you did build on
[1:03:09] the foundation, you can stand in faith.
[1:03:12] You can be secure. You can be happy
[1:03:14] today. You can be excited to be in the
[1:03:16] house of God because I know that my life
[1:03:18] is built on the foundation. I may not
[1:03:20] have done everything right. I've made
[1:03:21] many mistakes, BUT TODAY MY LIFE IS
[1:03:24] BASED NOT ON MY OWN WORKS, but on the
[1:03:26] workmanship of Jesus Christ in my life.
[1:03:30] &gt;&gt; All of us have a past. All of us have
[1:03:32] made mistakes, BUT I'M SO GLAD FOR A
[1:03:34] FOUNDATION THAT I CAN [screaming] COME
[1:03:36] BACK TO.
[1:03:37] &gt;&gt; WHEN I GET OFF OF IT, IT'S STILL THERE.
[1:03:40] &gt;&gt; I can come back to the word.
[1:03:43] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon taught us that the book
[1:03:45] of Acts, they said, "It's just a
[1:03:46] scaffold." He said, "No, it's the
[1:03:47] foundation." The apostles and prophets.
[1:03:50] He said, "Don't build your home on
[1:03:52] anything else."
[1:03:55] If there's anything I have a heart for
[1:03:57] in this age, it's homes. because of the
[1:03:59] the time that we're living in. It's a
[1:04:01] difficult time.
[1:04:04] &gt;&gt; Our homes can't be built on opinion,
[1:04:07] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:04:08] &gt;&gt; Because my opinion is different from
[1:04:09] yours.
[1:04:12] &gt;&gt; Right? And and and maybe my family way
[1:04:14] of doing things is different from yours.
[1:04:16] But if two people will come together and
[1:04:18] build on the foundation,
[1:04:20] &gt;&gt; they can build a home,
[1:04:21] &gt;&gt; right? not just have a house.
[1:04:25] &gt;&gt; I don't believe uh we've taught this. We
[1:04:27] don't believe in divorce.
[1:04:29] &gt;&gt; We believe in we believe in uh eternal
[1:04:32] mates if we could say it like that. We
[1:04:35] believe in somebody that would that's a
[1:04:37] part of you.
[1:04:38] &gt;&gt; The person the one person on in the
[1:04:40] whole universe that was made for you
[1:04:43] Gabon. You found it.
[1:04:44] &gt;&gt; You found that person.
[1:04:46] &gt;&gt; How did you find that person? Because
[1:04:48] you you built your life on the
[1:04:50] foundation.
[1:04:52] Are you with me now?
[1:04:53] &gt;&gt; If you're not built on a foundation, you
[1:04:55] won't find the right person.
[1:04:57] &gt;&gt; And so, but you can build on that. And
[1:04:59] maybe maybe you weren't saved when you
[1:05:01] got married and you come together and
[1:05:03] and you say, "But but start building
[1:05:04] now." I believe if any two people really
[1:05:07] will will build on the foundation,
[1:05:09] they'll learn how to love one another
[1:05:10] and care for their children and build a
[1:05:13] home. Yeah,
[1:05:14] &gt;&gt; I'm speaking especially to our young
[1:05:16] people, but I think it applies to all of
[1:05:18] us.
[1:05:20] &gt;&gt; You know, I read an article this week
[1:05:22] about that 40 million people have left
[1:05:25] the church, quit going to church since
[1:05:27] co
[1:05:29] in the US. 40 million people.
[1:05:33] And I got to reading that and I went
[1:05:35] down to the comments. I don't know if
[1:05:36] any of you all do that, but I do. You
[1:05:38] know, when when you read a an article
[1:05:40] that you you know, you just skip past
[1:05:43] the article. I don't even like I don't
[1:05:45] even read articles that don't have
[1:05:46] comments.
[1:05:49] [laughter]
[1:05:51] Some of y'all know you do the same
[1:05:52] thing.
[1:05:54] And so I I saw this article and I went
[1:05:56] down to the comments. I read the article
[1:05:58] and then I went to the comments because
[1:05:59] that's important. And I went to the
[1:06:01] comments and I got to looking at them
[1:06:03] and you know it's so subjective.
[1:06:07] This one person said, 'You know, I quit
[1:06:09] going to church because I feel closer to
[1:06:11] God walking in the woods.
[1:06:14] I feel closer to God. The one person
[1:06:17] said, I felt more accepted at a Wiccan
[1:06:19] church than I did in my church.
[1:06:23] I feel more accepted.
[1:06:26] Right. the but they're making decisions
[1:06:29] based on they're making decisions the
[1:06:30] same way people make decisions about
[1:06:31] whether to go to church or not
[1:06:35] &gt;&gt; right I I don't feel like it I feel like
[1:06:38] I should you know do something different
[1:06:42] take a walk in the woods [snorts]
[1:06:46] they say I feel more spiritual and they
[1:06:47] probably did especially in some of these
[1:06:49] morgs out here
[1:06:51] I've been in churches where I would have
[1:06:53] been much better off to walk in the
[1:06:55] woods why do we go to church because of
[1:06:57] the foundation,
[1:06:59] &gt;&gt; right? That's the in the word. It's it's
[1:07:01] what the word tells us to do. It didn't
[1:07:03] say just to go when we felt good about
[1:07:05] it,
[1:07:07] &gt;&gt; right? But people have actually left the
[1:07:09] church because they say, "Well, there's
[1:07:10] just there's there's nothing to it. We
[1:07:12] we don't feel like that it's right. So,
[1:07:16] we're going." So, now the thing is
[1:07:18] people are spiritual but not religious.
[1:07:21] &gt;&gt; Spiritual. Everybody's spiritual. And
[1:07:24] they're getting a spirit. All right.
[1:07:25] They're getting a national spirit
[1:07:27] &gt;&gt; because this nation as a whole has left
[1:07:30] its foundations.
[1:07:32] &gt;&gt; Brother Bram said, "Our national spirit
[1:07:33] is frolic jokes." He said, "You know
[1:07:36] why? We were founded upon the doctrine
[1:07:38] of the apostles. We were founding upon
[1:07:40] leadership of great men like Washington,
[1:07:42] Lincoln, but we've moved off of that
[1:07:45] foundation and we know that we've got it
[1:07:48] coming." He said, "So this nation is
[1:07:50] like a boy whistling in a graveyard."
[1:07:52] Right? As he goes through, I can't
[1:07:54] whistle. That's why I don't go to
[1:07:55] graveyards.
[1:07:57] But it's like it's like a boy whistling
[1:07:58] in the graveyard. But he but he said
[1:08:01] they know that that they've got it
[1:08:02] coming. He said there's a nuclear bomb
[1:08:04] with their name on it. But he follows
[1:08:06] that up. He said, "But oh, what a
[1:08:07] blessed hope for the believer. It's
[1:08:09] lifting up hands. For our redemption is
[1:08:11] drawing nigh." When he sees these signs
[1:08:14] appearing, it's a great time for the
[1:08:16] believer because we're built on a
[1:08:19] foundation. Now, why would a person not
[1:08:20] build on the foundation? I want to
[1:08:22] address that before we close tonight.
[1:08:24] Boy, you're you're right with me. I
[1:08:26] appreciate it. I am uh I'm not doing a
[1:08:29] good job preaching, but you're doing a
[1:08:30] good job listening. Why would a person
[1:08:33] not build on the foundation?
[1:08:35] &gt;&gt; Stubbornness.
[1:08:40] If I don't build on the foundation, it's
[1:08:41] because of stubbornness. I'm not just
[1:08:43] making this up. If you go to Second
[1:08:45] Kings chapter 1, Ahab, the king Ahab,
[1:08:48] everybody remember Ahab. Brother Brandon
[1:08:50] said, "We live in a nation full of
[1:08:52] Ahabs. [snorts]
[1:08:54] people who are halfway believers.
[1:08:58] &gt;&gt; But Ahab
[1:09:00] had a son named Ahaziah. And brother
[1:09:02] Brandham taught us, he said, Ahaziah
[1:09:04] would have been a better better man if
[1:09:07] if Ahab had been a better man.
[1:09:09] &gt;&gt; Said if his father had been a better
[1:09:10] man,
[1:09:12] &gt;&gt; that ought to make us think as fathers.
[1:09:15] And but Ahaziah, he was caught between
[1:09:17] the religion of his father and the
[1:09:18] religion of his mother because his Ahab
[1:09:20] was a Jew who worshiped God. Remember,
[1:09:24] he had all them Hebrew prophets that
[1:09:26] prophesied to him, right? He was a Jew,
[1:09:28] but he was he was backslid and he
[1:09:31] married a woman who was not a believer.
[1:09:34] And so, she caused him all kinds of
[1:09:36] trouble, Jezebel. So, Jezebel was
[1:09:38] Ahaziah's mother. So after Ahab died,
[1:09:42] you'll find it in 2 Kings chapter 1. Uh
[1:09:45] Ahaziah is brother Brand said he
[1:09:47] probably drank too much and he fell
[1:09:49] through a lattice and got an infection.
[1:09:52] He said he probably fell through and
[1:09:53] broke his ribs and got an infection. And
[1:09:57] he tells his servant to go inquire of a
[1:09:59] god named Beelzeub.
[1:10:01] Beelub,
[1:10:03] god of Echron, whether or not he was
[1:10:05] going to be well. And this is when the
[1:10:08] vindicated prophet Elijah was in the
[1:10:11] land. But brother Brandon said he was
[1:10:13] confused because of his mother,
[1:10:16] &gt;&gt; right? And so he decided that he would
[1:10:18] go to be elabub because be elabub. The
[1:10:21] religion of beelub was more popular than
[1:10:24] than the religion of the one true god.
[1:10:27] &gt;&gt; Right? So he said, "We're going to go to
[1:10:29] be elabub and find out whether or not
[1:10:30] I'm going to be well." But God spoke to
[1:10:33] Elijah. The Bible says the angel of the
[1:10:35] Lord spoke to Elijah in 2 Kings 1:3 the
[1:10:38] Dishbite arise go up to meet the
[1:10:40] messengers of the king of Samaria and
[1:10:42] saying unto them is it not because
[1:10:44] there's not a God in Israel that you go
[1:10:46] to inquire of Beub the God of Echron
[1:10:50] and he said listen ask him why did you
[1:10:53] do it
[1:10:55] are you listening to me tonight and
[1:10:57] we're talking about foundations
[1:10:59] &gt;&gt; he said why did you do it
[1:11:01] &gt;&gt; what makes you do it why did you go for
[1:11:03] worldly ly pleasure instead of building
[1:11:05] your your life in the right way. Why?
[1:11:07] Why did you look to the world for
[1:11:10] satisfaction,
[1:11:11] &gt;&gt; instead of coming to God, instead of
[1:11:14] surrendering to him? I know we go
[1:11:15] through pain. I KNOW WE HAVE STRUGGLES.
[1:11:17] I know there's times it's hard to live
[1:11:19] as A CHRISTIAN, BUT WE OUGHT TO THAT
[1:11:21] OUGHT TO DRIVE US TO HIS THRONE. IT
[1:11:23] OUGHT TO MAKE US ALL THAT MUCH MORE
[1:11:24] DETERMINED TO BE IN THE HOUSE OF GOD.
[1:11:26] ALL THAT MUCH MORE DETERMINED TO FALL ON
[1:11:28] OUR KNEES AND SAY, "LORD, I need a
[1:11:30] revival. I need you. I need your
[1:11:32] presence." How many can say amen to that
[1:11:33] tonight? I need you to be with me. I
[1:11:36] need you to live. I need you to be in my
[1:11:38] home. I need you to be in my marriage. I
[1:11:39] need you to be with my children.
[1:11:42] &gt;&gt; It ought to drive us TO HIM WHEN WE GO
[1:11:43] THROUGH HARD TIMES. BUT FOR MANY PEOPLE,
[1:11:45] because they're confused about what THE
[1:11:47] FOUNDATION IS, THEY HAVEN'T BEEN
[1:11:48] SPENDING TIME IN THE WORD OR THEY'VE
[1:11:50] BEEN TAUGHT WRONG. AND SO, WHAT DO THEY
[1:11:51] DO? THEY go out to worldly pleasure
[1:11:54] &gt;&gt; for entertainment OR FOR SATISFACTION.
[1:11:57] AND IT'S NOT WHAT WE'RE SUPPOSED to do.
[1:12:00] &gt;&gt; Look what he says. Why did you do it? He
[1:12:02] said, well, he said, well, you know
[1:12:04] what's happened. You know the scripture.
[1:12:06] You got them in your own palace. The
[1:12:08] priests are around there. No doubt
[1:12:09] you've read them since a boy. Why did
[1:12:11] you do such a silly thing as that?
[1:12:15] He said, I wonder tonight if Christ
[1:12:16] would come on the scene over the nation
[1:12:18] today and drawing this nation to
[1:12:19] judgment, if that same question wouldn't
[1:12:22] been asked, why is it? Why is it we are
[1:12:24] doing these things? Why are we fussing
[1:12:26] in the government? I just listened to
[1:12:28] oral arguments yesterday from the
[1:12:30] Supreme Court on whether or not they
[1:12:32] allow boys on girls sports teams
[1:12:38] and and and some of the justices were
[1:12:40] sympathetic to it. I'm going, "What in
[1:12:43] the world?
[1:12:46] How do you get so messed up?"
[1:12:49] &gt;&gt; And I'm, no pun intended, I'm laying a
[1:12:51] foundation tonight for Sunday morning.
[1:12:54] But how does the world get? YOU EVER
[1:12:56] THINK ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED IN IN Genesis
[1:12:58] 1?
[1:12:59] &gt;&gt; How does it get without form and void?
[1:13:03] &gt;&gt; How does it become a wasteland?
[1:13:05] &gt;&gt; Now, think about it for a minute.
[1:13:08] &gt;&gt; BUT BUT GOD, THE THE WORD PUT ORDER TO
[1:13:10] THE VOID.
[1:13:11] &gt;&gt; YEAH.
[1:13:12] &gt;&gt; The the word spoke and and what was
[1:13:14] disorderly and chaos became order
[1:13:17] &gt;&gt; when the word spoke in it. THE SAME
[1:13:20] THING CAN HAPPEN IN OUR LIVES.
[1:13:24] But you realize Satan's eating, what
[1:13:26] Satan's doing is ACTUALLY TAKING THE
[1:13:27] WORLD BACK. Satan's eating IS COMING
[1:13:30] BACK INTO CHAOS
[1:13:32] &gt;&gt; where boys don't know who they are.
[1:13:33] GIRLS DON'T KNOW WHO THEY ARE. CHURCHES
[1:13:35] DON'T KNOW WHO THEY ARE. PEOPLE DON'T
[1:13:37] KNOW WHO THEY WORSHIP. Come on, church.
[1:13:40] &gt;&gt; People don't know. Even in the message,
[1:13:42] THEY MESSAGE BELIEVERS DON'T KNOW WHAT
[1:13:44] THEY BELIEVE.
[1:13:45] &gt;&gt; WHY ARE WE GETTING TO [screaming] THAT
[1:13:46] POINT? BECAUSE COME ON, CHURCH. The
[1:13:49] devil, SATAN, THE GOD OF THIS EVIL AGE
[1:13:52] IS TAKING PEOPLE BACK TO CHAOS. BUT I
[1:13:54] DON'T WANT TO GO TO CHAOS. I WANT TO I
[1:13:56] WANT TO GO TO THAT HEAVENLY JERUSALEM, A
[1:13:58] NEW CITY, AN ORDERLY PLACE
[1:14:01] &gt;&gt; BUILT BY the word of God.
[1:14:03] &gt;&gt; Do you want order in your home? Do you
[1:14:05] want it to run? You say, "Well, I want
[1:14:06] peace in my home, so I I'll just start
[1:14:08] doing what some psychologist SAYS OR
[1:14:10] SOMEBODY ELSE." COME BACK TO THE WORD.
[1:14:15] &gt;&gt; I want peace at work. I want TO I WANT
[1:14:17] TO BE ABLE TO DO RIGHT AND LIVE RIGHT.
[1:14:18] KNOW I'M GOING TO BE. SO, I'LL just go
[1:14:20] out and do what the world does. NO,
[1:14:21] LET'S GO BACK TO THE WORD. FIND OUT IF
[1:14:23] WE'RE DOING THE RIGHT THING.
[1:14:25] &gt;&gt; If we're building on the foundation and
[1:14:28] then if we are set our face to go
[1:14:30] forward,
[1:14:34] [snorts] say why are we fussing in the
[1:14:35] government whether we should read the
[1:14:36] Bible in public? And why if we're
[1:14:38] reading all this nonsense?
[1:14:41] Did not our forefathers set this
[1:14:42] constitution in order? Did not this
[1:14:45] nation be born upon the principles of
[1:14:46] the Bible? Aren't we here for freedom of
[1:14:49] religion to act in God the way we feel
[1:14:51] fit to act the way we are convinced is
[1:14:53] truth? But you see, we've done something
[1:14:55] like they did then. We're just letting
[1:14:58] everything politics swallow us up
[1:15:00] instead of respecting our faith in our
[1:15:02] God. Men who has stood for truth. We're
[1:15:05] letting our politics run over that.
[1:15:07] Voting in such stuff that's polluting
[1:15:09] this nation. Well, we're coming to a
[1:15:12] judgment.
[1:15:13] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon makes a statement in
[1:15:15] that sermon. He said, "God will raise up
[1:15:16] a prophet and they'll know it was God,
[1:15:19] but they won't repent."
[1:15:21] &gt;&gt; He did.
[1:15:24] &gt;&gt; And they knew it was God.
[1:15:27] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:15:29] &gt;&gt; Vice President Nixon attended the
[1:15:31] meetings. I've been told in Washington
[1:15:33] DC, they knew it was God.
[1:15:36] &gt;&gt; The world knew it was God,
[1:15:38] &gt;&gt; but they didn't repent.
[1:15:40] &gt;&gt; And Jeremiah asked the question,
[1:15:41] Jeremiah 8:22, "Is there no bomb in
[1:15:43] Gilead? Is there no physician there? Why
[1:15:46] then is not the health of the daughter
[1:15:47] of my people recovered? I would ask us
[1:15:50] the same thing tonight. We live below
[1:15:52] our privileges,
[1:15:55] &gt;&gt; right? If if if if our life and I
[1:15:58] understand everybody's going to have
[1:15:59] winds and storm, but if your building
[1:16:01] keeps getting knocked down,
[1:16:04] why is that?
[1:16:05] &gt;&gt; Why then is not the health of the
[1:16:07] daughter of my people recovered?
[1:16:10] &gt;&gt; Brandon said, "We wonder that tonight.
[1:16:11] Why is there no Bible? Is there no God?
[1:16:13] Is there no difference? If God is going
[1:16:16] to bring the people to judgment, he's
[1:16:17] got to have something to judge them by.
[1:16:18] There's got to be some standard. But God
[1:16:21] will judge the world by Jesus Christ.
[1:16:23] And Jesus Christ is the word. The word
[1:16:25] is God. And he will judge them by this
[1:16:26] Bible. For this is the word. That is
[1:16:29] God's standard. We must Someone say it
[1:16:32] with me. We must measure up to what the
[1:16:34] Bible says.
[1:16:37] &gt;&gt; Right? So our children just just don't
[1:16:38] get to decide whether they're boys or
[1:16:40] girls. That's right.
[1:16:42] &gt;&gt; We teach them that a boy is a boy and a
[1:16:44] girl is a girl.
[1:16:46] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:16:47] &gt;&gt; Right. We don't get to decide whether we
[1:16:49] should get married four or five times.
[1:16:51] &gt;&gt; We teach them once you make that vow,
[1:16:53] that's for that's for good.
[1:16:57] &gt;&gt; Are you with me? I know. I know it's
[1:16:58] heavy, but but we need to make sure our
[1:17:01] foundation is right cuz we sure don't
[1:17:03] want to get blown down between now and
[1:17:04] Sunday morning.
[1:17:08] &gt;&gt; Now, Brother Brham said that that's
[1:17:09] God's standard. we must measure up to
[1:17:11] what the Bible says. Now, it wasn't
[1:17:12] exactly they didn't have a physician.
[1:17:14] They did. We have a physician, the great
[1:17:16] physician tonight. He said God was the
[1:17:19] physician. It wasn't because there
[1:17:20] wasn't a God in Israel. There was a God.
[1:17:22] They had a prophet TO CONSULT TO FIND
[1:17:24] OUT WHAT THESE things are. But it was
[1:17:26] the king's own stubborn will.
[1:17:31] &gt;&gt; And it's the same thing that gets in the
[1:17:33] way every time.
[1:17:35] We know the word,
[1:17:37] right? And we're taught it. I'm not
[1:17:39] preaching at anybody. I'm preaching at
[1:17:41] me if anybody because this is the story
[1:17:43] of my life where I've messed up in my
[1:17:45] life. When I when I get a little off the
[1:17:47] path, it's because my own stubborn will.
[1:17:50] Can anyone say amen to that tonight? It
[1:17:52] was the king's own stubborn will.
[1:17:56] &gt;&gt; Oh my. He said that's what's the matter
[1:17:58] in the nation today. It's the people's
[1:18:00] own stubborn will. Not because we don't
[1:18:02] have the same God that crossed the Red
[1:18:03] Sea. Brother Joel talked about that
[1:18:05] Sunday night with his people that fed
[1:18:07] them 40 years in the wilderness. It's
[1:18:08] not because we don't have the same God
[1:18:10] that we had in the beginning. It's the
[1:18:12] people's own stubborn way.
[1:18:15] &gt;&gt; He said they don't want to bow down.
[1:18:17] They don't want to have anything to do
[1:18:19] with holiness
[1:18:21] and purity of living, the Bible way of
[1:18:23] living. They'd rather belong to church
[1:18:25] and put their name on a book, even in
[1:18:28] the message,
[1:18:30] &gt;&gt; live like the rest of the world, than to
[1:18:32] bow down to the promises and the
[1:18:34] commandments of Almighty God. But I say,
[1:18:36] God, let me bow down to THAT WHICH
[1:18:38] BRINGS ORDER IN MY LIFE. LET ME WORSHIP
[1:18:40] that which WHICH CREATES STABILITY. Let
[1:18:43] let me let me in inquire of and and ASK
[1:18:46] THE ONE WHO'S GOT ALL THE ANSWERS. Come
[1:18:49] on, CHURCH. YOU MIGHT ASK THE INTERNET,
[1:18:50] GOOGLE don't have all the answers. CHAT
[1:18:53] GPT DON'T HAVE ALL THE ANSWERS. YOUR
[1:18:55] FAVORITE PREACHER DON'T HAVE ALL THE
[1:18:56] ANSWERS. BUT THERE is one who's got all
[1:18:58] the answers. WE CAN INQUIRE OF HIM
[1:19:01] TODAY. YOU SAY, "WELL, GOOGLE'S EASY. I
[1:19:03] can get on there and ask a question."
[1:19:04] Listen, prayer is easy, too. You don't
[1:19:06] have to WORK YOURSELF UP. YOU TALK TO
[1:19:08] GOD LIKE YOU DO TO A FRIEND and say,
[1:19:10] "Lord, I need an answer." And he'll give
[1:19:12] you one in his word.
[1:19:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:15] &gt;&gt; He'll speak to you tonight. I'm a
[1:19:16] witness. How many could witness with me
[1:19:18] tonight? If you really get down TO
[1:19:19] BUSINESS WITH GOD, HE'LL speak to you
[1:19:21] and lead you and tell you what to do.
[1:19:24] &gt;&gt; He'll put you in the right place.
[1:19:27] &gt;&gt; WE BOW DOWN to the promises. GLORY TO
[1:19:29] GOD. BECAUSE WHEN I'M SURRENDERED TO THE
[1:19:31] PROMISES, THERE'S HEALING IN MY LIFE.
[1:19:33] THERE'S STABILITY IN MY MARRIAGE.
[1:19:35] THERE'S STABILITY IN the church
[1:19:37] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE I'M NOT GOING BY MY OWN OPINION.
[1:19:39] I'M NOT UP HERE PREACHING A BUNCH OF
[1:19:40] STUFF I MADE UP. BUT I'M ON THE
[1:19:42] [screaming] FOUNDATION OF THE APOSTLES
[1:19:43] AND THE PROPHETS.
[1:19:47] &gt;&gt; He said, "That's what the matter today
[1:19:48] is. It's the reason people are going the
[1:19:50] way they are. People get away from the
[1:19:51] word. You'll never be able to get
[1:19:53] straightened out till we get back on the
[1:19:54] right path."
[1:19:56] &gt;&gt; He said they built this building.
[1:19:57] talking about the building he was in,
[1:19:58] but the building here, I believe the
[1:20:00] building he was in was actually that
[1:20:01] that tabernacle in Hot Springs that
[1:20:04] brother Nathan Ericson went by and saw
[1:20:06] the other day said they built this
[1:20:08] building, put that corner down here
[1:20:10] somewhere. He said, "You'd never get the
[1:20:12] building built. Just put it down
[1:20:14] anywhere." He said, "You got to be laid
[1:20:15] on the foundation." And the foundation
[1:20:18] is the Bible, doctrine of apostles and
[1:20:20] prophets and so forth of the Bible.
[1:20:23] He comes back to he said the king's own
[1:20:28] stubborn way.
[1:20:30] Oh, brother Josh, how my heart was
[1:20:32] convicted as I as I listened and I read
[1:20:34] that and I went back and listened to it
[1:20:36] and I said, "Oh, God, don't let me just
[1:20:38] do things out of my own stubborn will.
[1:20:41] Let me build on a foundation.
[1:20:44] &gt;&gt; It's been laid."
[1:20:46] &gt;&gt; Said he didn't just want to sin down
[1:20:47] there. It wasn't very popular.
[1:20:50] Brother Brandham talked about in this
[1:20:52] message, he talked about how people
[1:20:53] would die. He said a man will die on a
[1:20:55] doctor's doorstep if he won't take the
[1:20:58] medicine the doctor gave him.
[1:21:00] &gt;&gt; He said if he's got a curable disease
[1:21:02] &gt;&gt; and the doctor gives you medicine for it
[1:21:04] and you won't take it. He said he said
[1:21:05] that the man would die on the doctor's
[1:21:07] doorstep. Look, we understand there's
[1:21:09] some things medicine won't cure and
[1:21:10] that's when we give up to God,
[1:21:12] &gt;&gt; right? But but if it's a curable
[1:21:14] disease, he said here was something that
[1:21:15] he could be cured of. He won't take the
[1:21:17] medicine. He said they die on the
[1:21:19] doctor's doorstep. He said people die on
[1:21:20] the pews
[1:21:22] &gt;&gt; because they won't take the medicine. He
[1:21:23] said people sit in the church and hear
[1:21:24] the messages of God and believe them.
[1:21:29] &gt;&gt; Church, do you realize where the line
[1:21:30] is? This where Jesus said. He said, "If
[1:21:32] anyone hear these sayings of mine and do
[1:21:35] it,
[1:21:37] &gt;&gt; his house will be on a rock." Yeah.
[1:21:39] &gt;&gt; But if he just hears it and don't do it,
[1:21:42] &gt;&gt; realize the danger that young people, if
[1:21:43] you grow up in church and you've heard
[1:21:46] the sound went to all the earth, you've
[1:21:48] heard. We are without excuse today.
[1:21:51] &gt;&gt; We know what the word says. If you don't
[1:21:54] know, you can know. Don't build your
[1:21:57] life on your own opinion.
[1:22:00] Die on the pew. People sit in the church
[1:22:02] and hear the message of God and believe
[1:22:04] them and won't accept it. They wouldn't
[1:22:06] say, "Well, now I don't believe that's
[1:22:07] right.
[1:22:09] Some of them will come say and agree
[1:22:11] with it. Say, "I believe it's right, but
[1:22:13] you won't do it." He said, "You'll die."
[1:22:16] Dying in the pews of the church because
[1:22:18] they won't accept the remedy. They won't
[1:22:20] see what it does. It takes a little bit
[1:22:21] of the popularity out of the people.
[1:22:23] Kind of beats them up a little bit. He
[1:22:25] said they're afraid of that new birth.
[1:22:26] You know, any birth is a mess. He I
[1:22:28] don't care what it is. If it's in a pig
[1:22:30] pin or a pink decorated hospital, it's a
[1:22:32] mess. And so is the new birth. It'll
[1:22:33] make you do things you didn't think you
[1:22:35] would do. It'll straighten you up. But
[1:22:36] before you can ever get right, you have
[1:22:38] to come through that mess.
[1:22:39] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:22:40] &gt;&gt; I know, as I said, I I keep repeating
[1:22:42] that, but it's heavy on a Wednesday
[1:22:43] night. I know that. But if we could ever
[1:22:44] get this little group that's here, you
[1:22:46] know, I know you really want to be in
[1:22:47] church or you wouldn't have worked all
[1:22:49] day and come to church on a Wednesday
[1:22:50] night. And I salute you for that. But if
[1:22:52] you're here tonight, if we could just
[1:22:53] get us right, if we could just get this
[1:22:55] little group of believers in one accord
[1:22:57] IN ONE PLACE, I BELIEVE THE HOLY GHOST
[1:22:59] IS STILL THE SAME AS HE WAS on the DAY
[1:23:01] OF PENTECOST. I BELIEVE THAT FOUNDATION
[1:23:03] IS STILL THERE. YEAH,
[1:23:05] &gt;&gt; if we could just get us in the same in
[1:23:07] the same thought and the same mind.
[1:23:09] Lord, I'm going to bow down before your
[1:23:11] word. I'm going to ask YOUR OPINION. I'M
[1:23:13] GOING TO I'M GOING TO FIND OUT WHAT THE
[1:23:14] MESSAGE SAYS. FIND OUT WHAT THE
[1:23:16] SCRIPTURES SAY.
[1:23:19] He said, "A birth is a mess." He said,
[1:23:20] "So is the new birth. It'll make you do
[1:23:22] things you didn't think you'd do. It'll
[1:23:23] straighten you up. Before you can ever
[1:23:24] get right, you got to come through that
[1:23:26] mess. Before a seed can ever be born, it
[1:23:28] has to die and rot." And that's what's
[1:23:30] the matter with people today. They don't
[1:23:31] want to die and rot out to the world so
[1:23:33] they can be born again of the Holy
[1:23:36] Ghost.
[1:23:37] What did the chief cornerstone say? You
[1:23:39] must be born again. What did Paul say?
[1:23:42] And I'm closing with this. He said,
[1:23:45] "According to the grace of God, which is
[1:23:47] given unto me as a wise master builder,
[1:23:51] I have laid the foundation,
[1:23:54] and another buildth thereon. But let
[1:23:57] every man take heed
[1:23:59] how he buildth
[1:24:02] thereon.
[1:24:04] Would you bow your heads with me for
[1:24:05] just a moment?
[1:24:10] [snorts] It's Wednesday night. We've got
[1:24:11] things to do, but I just want to
[1:24:15] we come for reflection, brother. We come
[1:24:17] to church. It's the house of correction.
[1:24:21] I say, Lord, correct me.
[1:24:25] I can be a very stubborn person
[1:24:29] and yet I know that
[1:24:32] stubbornness is like witchcraft.
[1:24:35] The Bible says has a sin of witchcraft.
[1:24:40] Rebellion.
[1:24:42] I don't want to have rebellion to the
[1:24:44] word. I don't want to sit there and
[1:24:45] believe it and know it's true. Not do
[1:24:47] it. Say, "God, help me tonight.
[1:24:51] When I know if I do it, my family will
[1:24:53] be right and my life will get better and
[1:24:58] there will be benefits even in this life
[1:25:00] of living right.
[1:25:04] I've preached many times to people who
[1:25:05] were about to make a very bad decision
[1:25:07] in their life because they they
[1:25:08] consulted be elabub
[1:25:11] instead of consulting Jesus the word.
[1:25:15] Why don't you talk to Jesus tonight? If
[1:25:17] you got some decision to make, if you've
[1:25:19] got a
[1:25:21] young people, if you if you don't know
[1:25:23] where to go in life, you don't know what
[1:25:25] to do, ask the word.
[1:25:28] And don't ask in a way of like, well,
[1:25:30] I'll find out what he says. If I don't
[1:25:31] agree with it, I'll do my own thing. But
[1:25:33] say, Lord, I surrender. I surrender my
[1:25:36] heart. I surrender my life. I surrender
[1:25:38] my ways. I surrender everything to you.
[1:25:43] I want my life to start right. I want it
[1:25:45] to continue right. I got a ministry. I
[1:25:47] want my ministry to be built on the
[1:25:48] foundation of the apostles and prophets.
[1:25:50] I WANT MY FAMILY TO be built on the
[1:25:52] foundation of the apostles and prophets.
[1:25:54] I want the church to be built on the
[1:25:56] foundation of the apostles and prophets.
[1:25:57] Let it be, Lord.
[1:26:00] Take away that old stubborn will.
[1:26:04] Put in a heart of flesh.
[1:26:07] Oh God, we don't want to be
[1:26:08] hard-hearted, church. We don't want to
[1:26:11] get stubborn.
[1:26:16] This is how my family will run. You
[1:26:17] better check that out with the word.
[1:26:21] If you just because you've been doing
[1:26:22] something for 40 years, don't make it
[1:26:24] right.
[1:26:26] This is how I talk to my wife, you
[1:26:27] better check it out with the word. This
[1:26:28] is how I talk to my husband. You better
[1:26:30] check it out with the word. This is how
[1:26:32] I deal with my children. You better
[1:26:33] check it out with the word. Build on the
[1:26:36] right foundation.
[1:26:40] Today, people consult YouTube videos to
[1:26:42] find out how to build things.
[1:26:46] And some people become good builders
[1:26:48] just by consulting videos. We have a a
[1:26:52] vision that's been given in this day, a
[1:26:53] prophet to show us how to build, to take
[1:26:56] the scriptures and show us how to set up
[1:26:58] a family, how to set up a church. Let's
[1:27:00] take advantage of that church and
[1:27:03] surrender oursel to the word of the
[1:27:04] hour. Would you do that tonight?
[1:27:06] Heavenly Father, Lord Jesus, with my
[1:27:09] head bowed, my heart bowed, Lord, I've
[1:27:12] got tears in my heart tonight. I I don't
[1:27:15] want my own stubborn will to get in the
[1:27:17] way till I would do that which was
[1:27:20] popular instead of that which was right.
[1:27:23] Oh God, I pray that you'd help me to be
[1:27:25] bound to your word. Lord, to do only
[1:27:28] what your word says to do. Oh, let me
[1:27:31] conduct my life. Let me build on a
[1:27:33] foundation, Lord. As I've testified
[1:27:36] already, I know that where I've built on
[1:27:38] the foundation, that has lasted in my
[1:27:40] life. There's a lasting quality to that
[1:27:43] which is built on the foundation, Lord.
[1:27:45] And when I build, let me not build with
[1:27:48] hay and stubble, but let me build,
[1:27:50] oh God, with precious jewels, Lord, that
[1:27:54] I mine from the word of God. Pray you'd
[1:27:57] grant it, Lord God. Let me build a a
[1:27:59] house appropriate for a temple for you.
[1:28:01] Let me be a pillar in that temple, oh
[1:28:03] God. Oh, I pray you grant it, oh God.
[1:28:07] Forgive us, Lord, where we've not built
[1:28:08] the right foundation. We don't want
[1:28:11] chaos. We don't The world is slipping
[1:28:13] into chaos. They don't know who they
[1:28:14] are. Lord, we know who we are today. I
[1:28:18] pray none of these young people as we're
[1:28:20] going through the stream of time. And I
[1:28:21] pray they would not slip into that
[1:28:24] stream of of gaity that the prophet
[1:28:27] talked about, that stream of
[1:28:28] entertainment, that stream that was
[1:28:30] going by, that blackness and darkness,
[1:28:34] popularity. But oh God, may they remain
[1:28:37] on the straight and narrow way. Straight
[1:28:39] is the gate, and narrow is the way that
[1:28:41] leadth to salvation. I pray you'd grant
[1:28:43] it, Lord. May we lift up the standard of
[1:28:47] holiness in our lives. May we walk
[1:28:49] right. May we do what's right instead of
[1:28:51] living on the edge. Oh God, may we
[1:28:53] recognize that because we are elected,
[1:28:55] we've been called to holiness. I pray
[1:28:58] you'd grant it, Lord. I pray you'd move
[1:29:00] in every one of our lives. May we not
[1:29:01] take our own opinions. May I not take my
[1:29:04] opinions as a pastor. May we take the
[1:29:06] opinion of the word. Oh God, grant it
[1:29:09] today. I pray you'd grant it now.
[1:29:12] Father, we thank you for what you've
[1:29:13] given us this age. Thank you for a
[1:29:15] guidepost. Thank you for a map. We
[1:29:17] haven't been left here without
[1:29:19] directions,
[1:29:20] Lord. And every step of the way, you
[1:29:22] promise you would lead us and guide us.
[1:29:24] We thank you for that. I pray you'd lead
[1:29:27] these young people, lead these elders,
[1:29:28] oh God. Lord, till we come together
[1:29:30] again on Sunday. May there not be a
[1:29:32] house that's blown down, but may there
[1:29:34] be one that's built on a rock. Put
[1:29:37] another board on it, oh God. Another
[1:29:39] stone, another jewel. I pray you'd grant
[1:29:41] it today, Lord. Help us to build on the
[1:29:44] foundation of your word in Jesus name.
[1:29:48] Oh, thank you Lord.
[1:29:50] Hallelujah.
[1:29:52] Oh, I feel his presence tonight. Let
[1:29:55] &gt;&gt; let's just worship him a moment. If you
[1:29:57] need prayer, I'd be glad to pray with
[1:29:59] you tonight.
[1:30:00] &gt;&gt; I'm [music] sorry, Lord, for the thing

[1:30:23] &gt;&gt; Yes. It's all [singing and music] about
[1:30:24] you, Jesus.
[1:30:27] I'm sorry, Lord, for the thing [music]
[1:30:30] [singing] I've made. Oh, granted, Lord,
[1:30:33] and it's all about you. Oh, it's all
[1:30:37] about [singing and music]
[1:30:38] you, Jesus.
[1:30:42] With the music.

[1:30:47] away. Oh, and I simply [music] come. Why
[1:30:50] don't we just water the word with our
[1:30:52] praise tonight? Oh, longing just to
[1:30:57] bring [music]
[1:30:58] Oh, something [singing] that's the word
[1:31:02] that will bless [music] your heart. I'll
[1:31:06] bring you more than a song. Oh, I'll
[1:31:09] bring you more [singing] than a song.
[1:31:11] [music]
[1:31:12] For a song in itself is not what
[1:31:16] [music and singing] you have.
[1:31:19] Oh my. Well, church, if you feel him
[1:31:21] tonight, why don't you just stand
[1:31:23] [music] and talk to him for a minute and
[1:31:24] worship him now? He's worthy of our
[1:31:26] worship and praise.
[1:31:29] You're looking into [singing and music]
[1:31:31] my heart.
[1:31:35] And I'm [singing and music] coming back
[1:31:37] to the part of world

[1:32:30] I'll bring you more than a song.
[1:32:34] For a song [music and singing] itself
[1:32:37] is not what you have required.
[1:32:44] You search much deeper [music] within
[1:32:48] through the way things [singing]
[1:32:50] appear. You're [music] looking into my
[1:32:53] heart.
[1:32:57] And I'm coming back [singing and music]
[1:32:59] to the heart of worship
[1:33:03] where it's all [singing and music] about

[1:42:52] I just sit around and cry and sing old
[1:42:55] sad [music] songs. But then he whispers
