[55:20] name amen amen Mark chapter 4 and verse
[55:24] 26
[55:27] Mark 4 and
[55:40] 26 I want to continue a little bit on
[55:43] what we were talking about last week and
[55:44] I trust it'll be a blessing to
[55:48] you says Jesus speaking he said so is
[55:51] the kingdom of God as if a man should
[55:54] cast seed into the ground it should
[55:57] sleep and arise night and day and the
[55:59] seed should spring and grow up he
[56:01] knoweth not how for the Earth bringeth
[56:04] forth fruit of herself first the blade
[56:08] then the ear after that the full corn in
[56:11] the ear when the fruit is brought forth
[56:14] immediately he putteth in the sickle
[56:16] because the Harvest is come PR Lord
[56:20] would have his Blessing to the word you
[56:22] may be seated I want to speak to you on
[56:23] in in the presence of the Sun
[56:28] the word corn in the King James version
[56:30] is not corn like a like a sweet corn
[56:34] that we would have today in fact they
[56:36] didn't even have that whenever you see
[56:38] corn in the King James version is
[56:40] actually grain the word is grain it it
[56:43] means uh actually a a wheat or it could
[56:46] be another type of grain it means the
[56:49] seed the seed of grain and so uh it has
[56:54] a general meaning of grain we found in
[56:56] the parable that the wheat grows in a
[56:59] certain way that it's a very specific
[57:02] process that every time wheat grows it
[57:05] grows the same way right it comes up and
[57:08] then it it it comes up from the earth
[57:10] and it's it's a stalk it's a it produces
[57:12] a husk it produces the Grain and so this
[57:16] is the way Jesus put it and reading from
[57:19] a different version where it calls it
[57:21] grain it says by itself the soil
[57:24] produces a crop first the grass then the
[57:27] head of grain then the full grain in the
[57:31] head the full grain in the head church
[57:34] that's where we are right we're at the
[57:38] time of the full grain in the head we're
[57:41] not in the time of the preparation we're
[57:45] not in the time of when the grain is is
[57:47] still coming out of the ground we're not
[57:49] even in the time of the former rain or
[57:53] the latter rain or any of those things
[57:55] we're living in the time of the Harvest
[57:59] we in fact we're not only in the Harvest
[58:01] we're at the very end of the Harvest so
[58:05] we're looking at a time and I I want us
[58:07] to recognize my purpose I I would say in
[58:10] doing this as I've been inspired to this
[58:13] is so we would recognize where we are so
[58:16] we would know what do we expect in our
[58:18] hour what should we expect to be
[58:20] happening we should not expect the
[58:22] church world to be in Revival we should
[58:24] not expect the world in in general uh to
[58:27] have rain falling on it or America to be
[58:30] turning back to God that's not the hour
[58:32] we're living in but we're living at the
[58:35] very end of the end when the grain comes
[58:38] to its fullness and that's what we ought
[58:40] to be producing in our lives oh Church
[58:42] we're not producing a Methodist a
[58:44] Methodist grain or a Baptist season or
[58:47] or a Pentecostal season we're producing
[58:50] a bride season of the word in its
[58:53] fullness and so what that means is that
[58:55] we are producing the life of Jesus
[58:58] Christ in the earth that we live in
[59:00] today and I'm thankful for that I'm
[59:02] thankful for clarity I'm thankful that
[59:05] this message didn't come to confuse us
[59:07] further but this message come to tell us
[59:09] who we are and where we are how many
[59:13] believe that this
[59:14] morning amen aren't you glad aren't you
[59:17] glad we can we can still you know
[59:18] there's a lot of things we do as a
[59:20] church but but ultimately what are we
[59:22] here for we're here to express Christ
[59:25] and let the Deacon be an expression of
[59:27] Christ in his Deacon work let the
[59:29] pastors be an expression of Christ in
[59:32] their work Let the church be an
[59:34] expression of Jesus Christ in their
[59:36] everyday lives and you I express Christ
[59:38] here in the Pulpit but I express him at
[59:40] home to my family you express him at
[59:42] your work you express him at home with
[59:45] your wife or with your husband what is
[59:47] it it's a manifestation of of what God
[59:49] wants and I believe that the full grain
[59:52] has coming this hour what that means is
[59:54] that we are to manifest completely and
[59:57] produce a bumper crop Jesus said some
[59:59] would produce tfold or 50-fold but this
[1:00:02] hour We're supposed to produce H
[1:00:04] hundredfold right H hundredfold what is
[1:00:07] that it means that we're going to come
[1:00:09] fully to what God intended for a bride
[1:00:12] to be when he saw the Gentile bride in
[1:00:14] his mind he saw what we would be all
[1:00:17] right and that gives us great
[1:00:19] responsibility today we're not looking
[1:00:21] back to another age to see what they
[1:00:23] were or looking back to another time to
[1:00:26] see well maybe I can be like them or
[1:00:28] looking back at another place say well I
[1:00:30] wish it was like it used to be but what
[1:00:32] can I be today I have the potential of
[1:00:34] being the fullness of the word so I have
[1:00:36] the responsibility of displaying that in
[1:00:39] my life yeah so we're not waiting on
[1:00:42] something else to happen or he said
[1:00:43] brother Ben if I could only have a
[1:00:45] certain preacher come by boy I'd really
[1:00:47] I'd really worship then I'd really
[1:00:49] manifest the word of God then I tell you
[1:00:51] today's the day today's the day to
[1:00:53] worship God today's the day to manifest
[1:00:55] the word today is the day to be what God
[1:00:57] called you to
[1:00:59] be not tomorrow let's do it
[1:01:01] today let's not wait till tomorrow say
[1:01:04] well someday I'm going to really serve
[1:01:05] God I'm going to really give him my all
[1:01:07] why not give him your all today this is
[1:01:09] the Harvest
[1:01:11] Time
[1:01:13] amen so we know that as we said last uh
[1:01:18] week in Joel 223 it spoke of a former
[1:01:20] rain and a latter rain in the same
[1:01:22] season it's giv you the former rain
[1:01:25] moderately he will cause to come down
[1:01:26] for you the rain the former rain and the
[1:01:29] latter rain in the first month in the
[1:01:32] springtime in the beginning of
[1:01:34] Summer and so brother brandham speaks of
[1:01:37] it as future when he talks about it in
[1:01:40] some places in the message he says he
[1:01:43] talks about the ladder rain said what
[1:01:44] they're trying to do they're trying to
[1:01:45] manufacture a lad rain he's talking
[1:01:48] about those that went to gifts instead
[1:01:50] of staying with the word right and they
[1:01:53] just went into gifts and began to
[1:01:55] promote gifts instead of stand with the
[1:01:57] word we believe in the gifts but that's
[1:01:59] not our message right our message is the
[1:02:02] fullness it's the gifts plus the healing
[1:02:04] plus the Salvation plus justification
[1:02:06] sanctification it's all of it amen
[1:02:09] that's the hour that we live in our
[1:02:11] message is all of it so so we don't
[1:02:13] promote just one part of it we promote
[1:02:15] all of it so so what they're trying to
[1:02:17] do is they're trying to manufacture a
[1:02:19] latter rain nonsense he said why the
[1:02:21] latter rain will sweep the world brother
[1:02:23] been a former rain he said been a former
[1:02:25] rain sewing words that's right now
[1:02:27] you'll see what the latter rain produces
[1:02:29] you'll find out there'll be an
[1:02:31] affiliation the Pentecost Pentecostals
[1:02:33] and all the groups will come together
[1:02:35] and they'll shut the doors on them guys
[1:02:36] that won't listen to it he said you
[1:02:38] won't even be allowed to open your mouth
[1:02:39] he said that's when he'll come that's
[1:02:41] when he'll show that's when you'll see a
[1:02:43] rain he said oh my lay still be quiet
[1:02:46] let it go now brother brand was talking
[1:02:48] about something coming but he says
[1:02:51] something similar about the
[1:02:52] manifestation of the third pole we need
[1:02:54] to understand these things because
[1:02:56] people come out and they say well you
[1:02:58] know there there's there's something
[1:02:59] coming there's a there's a latter rain
[1:03:01] coming there's a third pole coming and
[1:03:03] they even will take quotes and say well
[1:03:05] brother random said this was coming but
[1:03:07] I want you to notice how he says it and
[1:03:09] what he says is we look at it when he
[1:03:11] says it as we look at it in order he
[1:03:13] says this about the manifestation of the
[1:03:15] third pole right at this time now it's
[1:03:16] just happened he said so it could
[1:03:18] identify its presence among you but it
[1:03:20] will not be used in a great way until
[1:03:22] this Council begins to tighten up he
[1:03:24] said and when it does when that does the
[1:03:26] Pentecost and so forth can almost
[1:03:27] impersonate anything can be done but
[1:03:29] when that time comes when the squeeze
[1:03:31] comes down and you'll see what you've
[1:03:33] seen temporarily be manifested in the
[1:03:35] fullness of its power now if I took a if
[1:03:38] you've been in the message very long and
[1:03:40] I took a poll this morning or a vote and
[1:03:43] and had you write down how many times
[1:03:45] that you thought brother brandom said
[1:03:47] the word squeeze in this context in the
[1:03:49] message I wonder how many times that
[1:03:50] would be because I've heard it all my
[1:03:52] life preached on the squeeze right I've
[1:03:55] heard preached on you know how many
[1:03:57] times brother brandham says it you're
[1:03:58] looking at
[1:03:59] it that's the only time brother brandham
[1:04:02] uses the word squeeze in reference to
[1:04:05] them closing the doors at least the only
[1:04:08] time I ever found brother B uses the
[1:04:10] term squeeze in reference to them
[1:04:11] closing the doors now we know the doors
[1:04:14] could be closed because we saw that in
[1:04:16] covid right and we've seen people
[1:04:18] voluntarily close their doors just quit
[1:04:20] having church it's a spirit in this age
[1:04:23] but yet so we know that could happen and
[1:04:26] yet brother brand was talking about
[1:04:27] something there will be a time coming
[1:04:28] now he said and then you'll see what
[1:04:30] you've seen temporarily be manifested in
[1:04:32] the fullness of its power now keep that
[1:04:35] in your mind and then we're going to go
[1:04:37] a little bit further brother brandham as
[1:04:39] he as he gets into
[1:04:41] 1964 there's a great change in brother
[1:04:43] Brand's Ministry because he realizes
[1:04:46] something that he's never realized
[1:04:47] before now I know this is real technical
[1:04:50] this morning but we're going somewhere
[1:04:52] so brother bam recognizes the truth that
[1:04:55] he didn't know before now first of all
[1:04:57] you've got to you you got to be willing
[1:04:59] to admit that the message that brother
[1:05:02] Bram had was Progressive that he didn't
[1:05:04] know it all at once right right because
[1:05:07] he didn't know the seals he said I was
[1:05:08] about to make a terrible mistake and the
[1:05:10] angel of the Lord I don't believe it's
[1:05:11] our job or my job to correct a prophet
[1:05:14] right right it's my job just to believe
[1:05:16] what he said right right it's my job to
[1:05:18] believe what he said I don't correct him
[1:05:20] but we do allow him to correct
[1:05:22] himself right and and it's not even to
[1:05:25] say that that which he preached before
[1:05:26] was wrong but it's to say that it's to
[1:05:29] say that what happened is the Angel of
[1:05:31] the Lord brought him up higher in
[1:05:33] Revelation it wasn't that it was wrong
[1:05:35] but brother brandham thought that the
[1:05:38] trumpets were to the
[1:05:40] church brother brandom he he told us he
[1:05:43] was going to preach the trumpets
[1:05:45] remember and then he preached a sermon
[1:05:47] called the Feast of the trumpets and he
[1:05:49] said I'm not going to preach the
[1:05:51] trumpets because the trumpets are to the
[1:05:53] Jews yeah right but he preached the
[1:05:56] Feast of the trumpets and under those
[1:05:58] trumpets you find in Revelation 9 and
[1:06:00] Revelation 9:14 specifically and and on
[1:06:03] down there were 200 million demons you
[1:06:05] remember that loose which had been bound
[1:06:07] in the river Euphrates that's a a
[1:06:09] persecution that's these demons are
[1:06:11] coming in persecution they were loose
[1:06:14] brother bham taught us on the Jews under
[1:06:16] Hitler en nightman how many know brother
[1:06:17] bham taught that under Hitler enitan
[1:06:20] they were released and loosed on the
[1:06:21] Jews and then they were he said to be
[1:06:24] released in Ecclesiastes IAL realm or an
[1:06:26] ecumenical realm on the bride so the
[1:06:29] loosing on the bride was in this
[1:06:32] ecclesiastical realm brought on by The
[1:06:35] ecumenical movement and those are big
[1:06:36] words I know they the children asked me
[1:06:38] to use uh words they could understand so
[1:06:41] ecumenical just means uh uh everybody
[1:06:44] together right it's a gathering of the
[1:06:47] churches it's it's all the churches
[1:06:49] together ecclesiastical just means the
[1:06:52] clergy the church the people religion
[1:06:56] so it's in a it's a persecution in a
[1:06:58] religious realm brought on by The
[1:07:00] ecumenical movement now watch what
[1:07:01] brother Bram says about this he said now
[1:07:03] the ecclesiastical realm has been open
[1:07:06] from the natural Revival of the old
[1:07:07] Pagan realm went forth on those Jews
[1:07:10] always been their enemy the lying with
[1:07:12] teeth and everything it stomped down and
[1:07:13] broke out the people he said Rome has
[1:07:15] always been God's enemy it was turned
[1:07:17] loose In The Same Spirit by the
[1:07:19] dictators of the world because the
[1:07:20] religious system was still holding so
[1:07:23] he's saying in in a natural way it was
[1:07:25] released on Hitler and
[1:07:26] itman right or on the Jews through them
[1:07:30] but now the religious system was still
[1:07:32] holding now watch what he says brother
[1:07:35] Brandon begins to teach this in 1964 is
[1:07:37] everybody awake this morning everybody
[1:07:39] with me brother Brandon begins to teach
[1:07:41] this and what does he begin to teach us
[1:07:44] he said look he said uh he said now it's
[1:07:49] been
[1:07:51] losos when then
[1:07:55] now it's been loosed what has it
[1:07:59] done right in the coming as he said he
[1:08:03] come in like
[1:08:04] flatteries what has he done he's
[1:08:06] bringing the Protestant ecumenical
[1:08:08] council of the world churches the spirit
[1:08:09] of antichrist upon both of them bringing
[1:08:11] them to the slaughter just like they did
[1:08:13] the other in the hour to call the bride
[1:08:16] how loosed in the ecclesiastical Church
[1:08:18] Spirit loosed upon what not upon the
[1:08:20] denominations upon the bride he said but
[1:08:23] here you'll get it oh I love this now
[1:08:25] watch he just said it's been loosed on
[1:08:27] the bride so you said oh get ready
[1:08:29] they're going to close the doors but
[1:08:31] look what he says the bride will not go
[1:08:33] through that time all
[1:08:35] right right so he's looking for
[1:08:37] something to come right and then he says
[1:08:40] no that's to the Jews and remember the
[1:08:43] quote we l last or we read last week he
[1:08:45] said the rain is over and he dealt with
[1:08:48] it with the Jews he said the rain is
[1:08:49] over the former and the latter rain have
[1:08:51] come what are we doing we're laying in
[1:08:53] the presence of the Sun
[1:08:55] the bride will not go through that time
[1:08:57] right the Bible says not the church will
[1:09:00] but not the bride right he said can't
[1:09:02] you see ministers can't you see that
[1:09:04] Brethren you say the church has to go
[1:09:06] through the persecution for the
[1:09:07] Perfection of it the blood of Jesus
[1:09:09] Christ perfects the bride aren't you
[1:09:11] glad for that today listen I don't even
[1:09:14] perfect the bride I we we preach for the
[1:09:16] maturity of the bride and the and the
[1:09:18] completeness of the Bride but the blood
[1:09:20] is what perfects the bride sir you're
[1:09:22] perfected by the blood this morning
[1:09:24] because I can't make you without sin but
[1:09:26] the blood can make you without sin yes
[1:09:31] sir so now he again he and you can read
[1:09:35] it all I don't have time to read it all
[1:09:36] brother Brown deals with this in length
[1:09:38] in the Feast of the trumpets he said
[1:09:40] notice there she is now she's loosed to
[1:09:43] call all these now what she Loos to do
[1:09:46] now watch he said it would come in in
[1:09:48] flatteries see it's in a spiritual realm
[1:09:51] a religious realm she's
[1:09:53] loosed that person tion's on everybody's
[1:09:56] waiting on the persecution it's
[1:09:58] on it's happened if there's ever been a
[1:10:01] time we need to get right with God
[1:10:03] today's today everybody looking for a
[1:10:05] squeeze it's
[1:10:06] on right are you with me now but in the
[1:10:11] spiritual realm but before it comes in a
[1:10:13] natural realm we'll be gone right so
[1:10:15] there will come a time they they may
[1:10:16] close the doors of churches like this
[1:10:18] but not while the bride's here right in
[1:10:20] chrisis the mystery of God revealed we
[1:10:22] haven't got to it yet in that sermon
[1:10:23] brother brand said before they can shut
[1:10:24] us up he'll he'll take us up
[1:10:27] right amen amen I'm so glad for that
[1:10:30] promise so I believe we'll still be able
[1:10:32] to have
[1:10:33] church until the day that we go home I
[1:10:37] believe somehow we may be under pers you
[1:10:39] say persecution is coming well it's
[1:10:41] there in different parts of the world
[1:10:43] right but but no matter what happens in
[1:10:45] the political system we're going to be
[1:10:47] able to fulfill the commission of God
[1:10:50] preach Go in all world and preach the
[1:10:52] gospel to Every Creature listen it would
[1:10:54] illegal to be a CHR Christian in the
[1:10:55] first church in the early church but
[1:10:58] they still preach they still had Church
[1:11:01] they still love one another they still
[1:11:03] gathered together yeah and you say Well
[1:11:06] it it could come to that but listen he
[1:11:07] said before it comes to that we go
[1:11:10] home oh I just love that see we don't
[1:11:13] Place ourselves as foolish virgin the
[1:11:16] bride he's coming to a point in his
[1:11:17] ministry where he's telling us there's a
[1:11:19] difference in the bride and the church
[1:11:21] there's a difference in brother Brandon
[1:11:23] being called to do that he's separating
[1:11:24] the bride
[1:11:25] the church and the foolish virgin the
[1:11:27] foolish virgin goes through that
[1:11:28] tribulation period right if you're
[1:11:31] foolish virgin today you need to be
[1:11:32] getting ready for a tribulation but God
[1:11:36] didn't call me to be a foolish
[1:11:38] virgin I don't like to be foolish I want
[1:11:41] to be
[1:11:42] wise and I believe he's called me to be
[1:11:44] wise I believe he's called me to be the
[1:11:46] bride and in order to be the bride it
[1:11:48] means that I skip the tribulation period
[1:11:51] right I've been I I'm caught up in a
[1:11:54] rapture
[1:11:55] so brother Ben what are you looking for
[1:11:56] I'm looking for the world to continue to
[1:11:58] be rich and increased in
[1:12:00] goods and say I have need of nothing for
[1:12:03] they to see it and continue to go on
[1:12:05] like it
[1:12:07] is then one day it
[1:12:09] stops and you can see the precursors to
[1:12:12] it you can see things that have happened
[1:12:14] and almost like a trial run for
[1:12:16] something coming you can see those
[1:12:18] things happening but it want it's held
[1:12:20] off what's it held by by you he that now
[1:12:24] lth will let until he's taken out of the
[1:12:26] way what is that the Holy Ghost in
[1:12:28] you oh aren't you glad there's something
[1:12:31] in you that's holding back the things
[1:12:33] that are coming on this Earth until you
[1:12:36] go home yes now are you with me so far I
[1:12:40] and you may not agree with me on this
[1:12:41] but I believe it's what a prophet taught
[1:12:42] her I wouldn't preach it now look
[1:12:45] brother brandom said he said that's he
[1:12:48] said notice there she is she's loose to
[1:12:50] call all these little Loose
[1:12:52] Ends oh well don't make any difference
[1:12:55] anyhow well it don't make any difference
[1:12:57] if we go to church all right don't make
[1:13:00] any difference if we cut our hair or not
[1:13:02] or what how we dress or how we look or
[1:13:05] don't make any difference what we
[1:13:07] believe about
[1:13:08] baptism that's the the squeeze that we
[1:13:12] feel that's the press that we're going
[1:13:15] through right I'm not looking for them
[1:13:19] listen if they told us tomorrow people
[1:13:21] are so fed up with that stuff if they
[1:13:23] told us tomorrow we couldn't have church
[1:13:24] I think pretty much all of you'd be in
[1:13:28] church I got no confidence in you you I
[1:13:31] that's all right I I believe you come to
[1:13:33] the house of
[1:13:35] God you you'd want to serve the Lord
[1:13:38] with all your heart in spite of
[1:13:39] persecution what gets us for the Joel
[1:13:41] what is it that that bothers Us in this
[1:13:43] hour it's not people telling us we can't
[1:13:45] do something it's people telling us oh
[1:13:47] why don't you watch this why don't you
[1:13:49] go here why don't you why don't you
[1:13:50] participate in this what keeps us out of
[1:13:53] church is not locks on the door
[1:13:55] [Applause]
[1:13:58] right I need to get back to my
[1:14:01] notes is that right what keeps us out of
[1:14:04] church is the L to see an age that's
[1:14:06] what keeps people out of the house of
[1:14:08] God it's not somebody coming locking the
[1:14:10] door it's people people just not being
[1:14:13] where they need to be with God say God
[1:14:15] help us today look look he he said
[1:14:19] That's what Satan said to Eve don't make
[1:14:20] any difference it's all right surely God
[1:14:22] is a good god he loves us all he said he
[1:14:23] doesn't that's right right you hear so
[1:14:26] much about it being a good god he's a
[1:14:28] good God but being good he has to be
[1:14:29] just there's no goodness without Justice
[1:14:31] there's no justice without no law
[1:14:33] without punishment penalty he said so
[1:14:35] we're in that
[1:14:36] hour that we're living he goes on he
[1:14:39] talks about crev and Eisenhower and the
[1:14:41] iron and the clay all the things that
[1:14:43] have happened he said but thank God the
[1:14:45] little bride has made herself ready it
[1:14:48] ain't long just hold on it won't be long
[1:14:51] he said I don't know how long don't know
[1:14:52] when nobody knows that but we know it's
[1:14:54] close now real so he he's preparing us
[1:14:58] he's separating the what what was seen
[1:15:00] for the for the foolish version What was
[1:15:03] seen for the Jews and what is seen for
[1:15:06] the bride so the very next month in
[1:15:09] questions and answers what we read to
[1:15:10] you last week I'll just read part of it
[1:15:12] he said I believe you're seeing the last
[1:15:14] thing someone say last thing that will
[1:15:17] happen to the church before the Rapture
[1:15:20] that next quote the last thing if I put
[1:15:21] it in there uh that will happen to the
[1:15:23] church before the Rapture that's exactly
[1:15:25] I believe it he said the rain is
[1:15:30] over the rain is over what does that
[1:15:32] mean again we explained it last week it
[1:15:34] don't mean there's no moisture it means
[1:15:36] the moisture is on the inside right
[1:15:40] there's water but it's coming out from
[1:15:41] under the throne that's what he said
[1:15:44] it's not the general rain falling on the
[1:15:46] population but it's something within the
[1:15:48] seed that causes it to mature in a dry
[1:15:51] time yes oh my the full summer sun has
[1:15:56] come out in our day all right let's look
[1:15:59] look at Luke 21: 29 this really blessed
[1:16:01] me when I saw it I hope you're ready to
[1:16:03] have church this morning did you come to
[1:16:05] have church I didn't come just to show
[1:16:08] up we come to have church this morning
[1:16:11] we might as well enjoy it right in the
[1:16:13] house of God now look in Luke 21:29 he
[1:16:16] spake to them a parable behold the Fig
[1:16:18] Tree and all the trees when they now
[1:16:21] shoot forth you see and know of your own
[1:16:24] selves that summer is now n at hand now
[1:16:27] remember in their timeline their Harvest
[1:16:30] was not in the fall but in the late
[1:16:33] summer actually it began in the early
[1:16:35] summer it begins in May and it goes
[1:16:38] through the hottest time of the year
[1:16:40] when the sun is at its full strength and
[1:16:43] and and harvest is really on the wheat
[1:16:45] Harvest is really on about June so
[1:16:49] brother brand said this about that he
[1:16:52] and he says that that fig tree is the
[1:16:54] Jewish Nation right we all understand
[1:16:57] that it's a Jewish Nation Israel become
[1:16:59] a nation May 14th 1948 the Fig Tree put
[1:17:04] forth its butt we can look at that and
[1:17:06] say that's history that happened we're
[1:17:09] not waiting on the Fig Tree to put forth
[1:17:10] its Bud it already happened right we're
[1:17:12] not waiting on all the other trees to
[1:17:14] put forth their buds that already
[1:17:17] happened right so now watch but when
[1:17:22] that happened is in the spring about the
[1:17:25] time that the latter rain
[1:17:28] fell oh my and so that would they would
[1:17:32] have noticed the Fig Tree putting forth
[1:17:34] its Bud now brother brandham Ties That
[1:17:36] Day the date of his commission with the
[1:17:38] date Israel become a nation you've heard
[1:17:40] him do that he uses brother B actually
[1:17:43] uses different dates for it 1946
[1:17:46] 1947 and critics use that and I'm just
[1:17:49] being honest with you this morning they
[1:17:50] do they take that and they use it to say
[1:17:52] brother Brandon was a liar but something
[1:17:54] did happen in
[1:17:56] 1947 which Israel become a nation
[1:17:58] officially in 1948 that's when they
[1:18:00] celebrate independence day but in 1947
[1:18:03] what brother Brown was talking about
[1:18:05] happening was the petition of Israel
[1:18:07] when the UN said that they could be a
[1:18:10] nation so brother Brandon says it this
[1:18:12] way and who is this he said Israel
[1:18:14] become a nation in 1947 the same night
[1:18:17] the angel of the Lord visited me when he
[1:18:18] came to me at 12:00 it was noon when
[1:18:20] they signed now watch when they signed
[1:18:22] that peace paact with the world the
[1:18:24] league of nation and so forth overseas
[1:18:25] it was the year before that they they
[1:18:28] had an independence day they still had
[1:18:31] to fight a war of
[1:18:33] independence right there still had was a
[1:18:34] lot of things had to happen before they
[1:18:36] could establish themselves nobody knew
[1:18:38] if they would win but the Lord helped
[1:18:40] them but it was the year before when
[1:18:42] they signed the peace Packa with the
[1:18:43] League of Nations in 1947 November 29th
[1:18:47] 1947 United Nations voted for the
[1:18:49] petition of the British Mandate of
[1:18:50] Palestine calling for the formation of a
[1:18:53] Jewish State and an Arab state the
[1:18:55] result was that the Jews accepted the
[1:18:56] deal the Arabs rejected it that's why we
[1:18:59] still have a fighting over there
[1:19:01] today so now here here was the former
[1:19:05] and the latter rain together the Fig
[1:19:07] Tree blooming so what what what's
[1:19:09] happening
[1:19:10] now if we can say that those things have
[1:19:15] happened what's taking place now oh
[1:19:19] Church the sun must be
[1:19:22] out in its full strength right it must
[1:19:26] be that's the hour that we're living in
[1:19:29] see brother BR said you said when the
[1:19:31] Fig Tree puts forth her buds no summer
[1:19:32] is n we see she is budding and we see
[1:19:35] all the other trees are budding we know
[1:19:38] it's near yes we see ishmail and Isaac
[1:19:41] Yonder at the Gate of each other's
[1:19:42] throat they still are aren't they just
[1:19:45] as you said every prophecy right now
[1:19:47] striking this is in
[1:19:49] 1957 yeah said God be merciful and save
[1:19:53] the Lost now watch he said the Fig Tree
[1:19:56] and all the other trees now in other
[1:19:58] words he said there'd be a universal
[1:20:00] Revival at the time when was there a
[1:20:02] universal Revival the last Universal
[1:20:05] Revival was the healing Revival that
[1:20:06] took place was Spar by Brother Brand's
[1:20:09] ministry right it was the Pentecostal
[1:20:11] Revival and then the healing Revival in
[1:20:13] 1947 started it we talked about how the
[1:20:15] latter rain movement come along during
[1:20:17] that time the Charismatic Church come
[1:20:19] out of that right everything was sparked
[1:20:21] from that that was the last Universal
[1:20:23] Revival brother r taught us at that
[1:20:25] ended in
[1:20:26] 1956 in Luke chap 21 and 31 Jesus goes
[1:20:30] on to say so likewise ye when you see
[1:20:32] these things come to pass know ye that
[1:20:34] the kingdom of God is not at hand verily
[1:20:37] I say unto you this generation shall not
[1:20:39] pass away till all be fulfilled what did
[1:20:43] he say summer is nigh when you see the
[1:20:46] Fig Tree putting forth its bud it's
[1:20:49] about time for the son yes right the s o
[1:20:52] n to come in his full strength right all
[1:20:56] Hallelujah so remember that was the time
[1:20:59] of harvest brother brand says we noticed
[1:21:01] before Springtime comes watch some of
[1:21:04] his laws when you see the trees putting
[1:21:06] forth buds he said you know that summer
[1:21:09] is nine Springtime is a sign of the
[1:21:12] introduction I love this of Summer
[1:21:15] coming on he said that's a law it always
[1:21:18] happens that way again he said remember
[1:21:21] we cannot live by yesterday's light
[1:21:23] yesterday's light is gone it isn't no
[1:21:24] more it's yesterday's light is only a
[1:21:26] memory yesterday's sunlight is only a
[1:21:28] memory or it's history we cannot live in
[1:21:30] yesterday's light no more and the same
[1:21:32] though it's the same Sun the same son
[1:21:34] but each day it brings forth its
[1:21:36] strength a little stronger oh I love
[1:21:38] that each day it brings forth its
[1:21:40] strength a little stronger to ripen the
[1:21:42] grain for the Harvest he said brother
[1:21:44] Ben what should I do if I want to really
[1:21:46] serve God in this age what should I do
[1:21:47] what should I be get into that word
[1:21:50] become that word live that word manif
[1:21:54] that word let that word and you become
[1:21:56] the same let it become a part of you the
[1:21:58] message was sent for a reason we can't
[1:22:01] live in yesterday's life but let that
[1:22:03] sun come a little stronger to you every
[1:22:05] day
[1:22:07] right the Sun comes today he said he
[1:22:11] said gets a little stronger each day now
[1:22:13] it'll get a little stronger a little
[1:22:15] stronger oh I believe that's the hour
[1:22:16] we're not where we were four years ago
[1:22:18] we're not where we were 20 years ago
[1:22:20] we're not where we were 50 years ago
[1:22:22] what is it the Sun every day coming on a
[1:22:25] Little Bit
[1:22:26] Stronger
[1:22:28] hallelujah
[1:22:30] hallelujah The Sun Comes A Little Bit
[1:22:32] Stronger a little stronger till finally
[1:22:33] the wheat that's laying there it'll go
[1:22:35] taking life all right see it doesn't
[1:22:37] take life from the wheat yeah but it
[1:22:40] actually gives life to the wheat are you
[1:22:43] with me now after a while the life will
[1:22:45] come up see it comes out of the stalk
[1:22:48] out of the husk it comes up then he said
[1:22:50] then a little stronger a little stronger
[1:22:53] March April May
[1:22:55] June
[1:22:57] July oh it's late
[1:23:00] Harvest by July what you doing in the
[1:23:02] land of Canaan is you're just going
[1:23:04] around and getting what was left yeah
[1:23:07] you're
[1:23:10] gleaning that's where we're at church
[1:23:13] especially here in America the Harvest
[1:23:16] it's coming to its end right we're at
[1:23:19] the downside of
[1:23:21] that March April May Jun you see what he
[1:23:24] saying it's a very clear teaching she's
[1:23:26] in the Harvest in you see the same sun
[1:23:29] shining today he said in January
[1:23:31] December that's when that's when he was
[1:23:33] preaching it he said that's up there
[1:23:34] bathing that snow and melting it down on
[1:23:36] that grain bringing it water it's the
[1:23:38] same Sun but that wheat could not live
[1:23:41] in that same sunlight in June it can't
[1:23:44] do it if you planted the wheat in June
[1:23:46] or July it would never come up because
[1:23:49] of the strength of the Sun at that time
[1:23:51] it's too hot so it has to become mature
[1:23:55] before it can oh Church before it can
[1:23:58] take the full strength of the sun well
[1:24:00] you know if you can't take this message
[1:24:02] in its fullness if if you're having a
[1:24:04] hard time living it if you're having a
[1:24:05] hard time accepting it in its fullness
[1:24:08] and and what it means to have a a profit
[1:24:10] in our day and things like that what you
[1:24:12] need is to come back to the fact you
[1:24:15] need to understand that you need to you
[1:24:18] need to lay in the presence of the son
[1:24:20] until you actually uh begin to get a
[1:24:23] revelation become sure enough to receive
[1:24:26] that kind of full strength right right
[1:24:30] you you've got to reach a place in your
[1:24:31] life you justification sanctification
[1:24:34] the baptism of the Holy Ghost and then
[1:24:36] you got to take another step yeah what
[1:24:39] is that it's our adoption the message of
[1:24:40] the hour it's coming in and becoming a
[1:24:43] mature Christian brother BR said you're
[1:24:44] not born a full born man right some of
[1:24:47] you young people you get discouraged
[1:24:48] because you say well I've not lived like
[1:24:50] I should some of you young Christians
[1:24:51] you say well I'm not doing everything
[1:24:53] right well nobody you know never seen a
[1:24:54] kid get up and and start a bank all
[1:24:57] right right kids don't get up and and
[1:25:00] and go to take the briefcase and go to
[1:25:03] work why they're not
[1:25:05] mature adults do but kids don't but but
[1:25:09] but here we we don't expect them to and
[1:25:12] you shouldn't expect yourself to but you
[1:25:14] do have to grow you can't stay in that
[1:25:16] stage forever forever brother Bon said

[1:25:22] walk don't don't don't say well you
[1:25:24] Never Walk Don't discourage him let him
[1:25:26] stumble but there comes a time we got to
[1:25:28] grow up and that's the hour that we're
[1:25:31] living in it's a time of of extreme
[1:25:33] growth within the seed and that's where
[1:25:36] I want to see the growth I love it when
[1:25:37] we see new people come I love to see the
[1:25:39] church fall but I want to see that
[1:25:41] extreme
[1:25:42] growth in the inside of the
[1:25:46] seed
[1:25:49] amen the first great
[1:25:52] sign in brother br's Ministry was on the
[1:25:55] river in
[1:25:57] 1933 in 1933 brother BR said I had a
[1:25:59] baptismal service in the middle of
[1:26:05] June the middle of June standing out
[1:26:09] there had been so hot for weeks hadn't
[1:26:10] had no rain for two or three weeks the
[1:26:13] country was burning up that voice come
[1:26:16] down and said as John the Baptist was
[1:26:17] sent forth to forerun the first coming
[1:26:19] of Christ so will your message forun the
[1:26:22] second coming of Christ what was it
[1:26:24] ladder rain so the full sun could come
[1:26:26] out are you with me
[1:26:28] now we we established last week what
[1:26:31] that was now
[1:26:32] almost every false Doctrine around this
[1:26:35] message comes from somebody not
[1:26:37] recognizing what season we're in that's
[1:26:40] right yeah right what season are we in
[1:26:42] it's time to be
[1:26:44] mature right and that's why and I'll say
[1:26:47] this you can't just keep making excuses
[1:26:48] he been in the message 40 years and say
[1:26:51] well I just you know I just can't hardly
[1:26:53] drag myself to to do what's right well
[1:26:56] you need the Holy Ghost you know at some
[1:26:57] point you skip the
[1:26:59] step right you need to be matured right
[1:27:04] right you you you don't need to keep
[1:27:05] making them mistakes all over again
[1:27:07] you've been around 40 years it's time to
[1:27:08] grow
[1:27:09] up right but now it's it's manifesting
[1:27:14] time
[1:27:16] summertime and and almost every false
[1:27:18] Doctrine comes from the fact people
[1:27:20] don't not recognizing what time we're
[1:27:21] living in I would say it's the end of
[1:27:24] sum time it's harvest time time to lay
[1:27:27] in the presence of the full word all
[1:27:30] right and to manifest what we are to be
[1:27:32] harvested in this hour see people are
[1:27:35] are still looking some people still
[1:27:36] looking for a fig tree to bloom looking
[1:27:39] for Israel to do something right Israel
[1:27:41] is ready to receive the
[1:27:43] message right they're they're in their
[1:27:46] Homeland they're ready yeah I'm not
[1:27:48] looking for Israel to do something I'm
[1:27:50] not looking for a Revival in and as far
[1:27:53] as a worldwide Revival I'm not I'm not
[1:27:56] talking about local Revival here I'm
[1:27:57] just talking about worldwide a worldwide
[1:27:59] Reign I'm not looking for that I'm not
[1:28:01] looking for return of a prophet I'm not
[1:28:04] looking for someone to bring more
[1:28:05] Revelation or someone to lead us you say
[1:28:08] well we're just waiting on Joshua to
[1:28:09] come brother brandham taught us his
[1:28:11] ministry typed Moses and Joshua right
[1:28:14] what he and he also told us Joshua was
[1:28:16] the Holy
[1:28:17] Ghost right so the Joshua is still here
[1:28:20] yeah to lead us in now he he said
[1:28:23] brother Brandon says this he said what
[1:28:24] time is it brother what time is it
[1:28:27] Minister do you see the time of the day
[1:28:30] and the sign that you're living under
[1:28:33] can you understand it do you see it
[1:28:35] everywhere now there's no Revival
[1:28:37] everybody is complaining ministers
[1:28:39] crying you realize what they're doing
[1:28:42] there's people today still in the
[1:28:43] message still under that I'm again I
[1:28:45] believe we should want Revival here in
[1:28:47] our local church we we should want God
[1:28:49] to move I believe that's the only place
[1:28:51] he is moving is in the bride yeah that's
[1:28:53] right but but we're not but we recognize
[1:28:55] nothing has to happen for that to happen
[1:28:58] right right it's here yeah Revival is
[1:29:00] for us it's here because it's within the
[1:29:03] seed the Revival that you need is right
[1:29:05] inside of
[1:29:07] you oh you young people you just
[1:29:09] understand what you need to be a real
[1:29:11] good Christian to be a mature Christian
[1:29:13] is already inside of you it just needs
[1:29:15] to manifest itself right that's right
[1:29:18] the Revival is within you where is the
[1:29:20] wst Revival he said I am the wst Revival
[1:29:23] so brother BR said everywhere now
[1:29:25] there's no Revival everybody's
[1:29:26] complaining Minister's crying you talked
[1:29:27] about the herald of his coming which was
[1:29:29] written by Jack Moore and how Jack Moore
[1:29:31] cried out we need to see a Revival and
[1:29:33] brother brand was just standing there
[1:29:34] and saying what you didn't see
[1:29:38] this imagine how that must have made
[1:29:40] brother brandom feel when Jack Moore's
[1:29:42] putting in his paper and printing we
[1:29:44] need a
[1:29:45] prophet we need Revival yeah he said you
[1:29:50] missed it
[1:29:52] yeah right I wonder how if a prophet
[1:29:55] would come back in our day I wonder how
[1:29:57] he would
[1:29:59] feel people looking at something to
[1:30:01] happen always he's he's going to do
[1:30:04] something else how would he feel about
[1:30:06] that they're crying for Revival all
[1:30:08] right right and not recognizing what's
[1:30:11] already happened what happened he said
[1:30:13] why did they do that they want a Great
[1:30:15] Awakening they're crying believing that
[1:30:16] there will be Awakening they're good
[1:30:18] people why is it what have they done
[1:30:21] they have not recognized The Awakening
[1:30:23] of the Bride come on by being a
[1:30:25] Christian they feel the pull of the hour
[1:30:28] they're Christians but they haven't
[1:30:30] recognized what's been done yes sir
[1:30:33] that's what's making them feel that way
[1:30:36] they know something is supposed to
[1:30:37] happen but see they're looking for it
[1:30:39] way off in the future to come when it's
[1:30:41] already happened right by you yes sir oh
[1:30:44] I believe that's the hour we're living
[1:30:45] in today it's already happened right by
[1:30:48] you yes again as we said brother
[1:30:50] Brandon's Ministry type Moses and Joshua
[1:30:52] going out and coming in the two parts to
[1:30:54] Redemption the two parts of the Exodus
[1:30:57] the first two polls of his ministry
[1:30:59] coming out the third pole going in a
[1:31:02] forerunner he he was a forerunner but he
[1:31:05] also introduced us to the word itself
[1:31:07] yes are you with me now so it wasn't
[1:31:10] just the ministry of the Forerunner it
[1:31:11] was also the ministry of Christ yeah
[1:31:14] right in the son of man now look the
[1:31:17] first two polls coming out the third
[1:31:18] poll going in a forerunner in the word
[1:31:20] itself the ending of a denominational
[1:31:21] age the beginning of the Bride age yes
[1:31:24] yes at the beginning of the harvest
[1:31:26] season there was a sheath waved right
[1:31:29] and I won't spend much time on this in
[1:31:30] fact I may skip through some of this but
[1:31:32] just so we understand the the Bible says
[1:31:34] there would be a sheath waved at the
[1:31:35] first fruits of the Harvest Leviticus
[1:31:38] 23:10 verse 11 he shall wave the sheath
[1:31:40] before the Lord to be accepted for you
[1:31:42] on the tomorrow after the Sabbath the
[1:31:43] priest shall wave it we know that Christ
[1:31:45] was that wave sheath brother random said
[1:31:46] it's not Su in anymore it's the s o n d
[1:31:49] a y the Sunday that that corn of wheat
[1:31:53] God's first one up from the dead is to
[1:31:55] be waved over the congregation that we
[1:31:57] are his seed and that's the first of
[1:32:00] those seed of those that slept waved
[1:32:02] upon the first day of the week yes he
[1:32:04] said notice it was the first corn of
[1:32:05] God's wheat that had been raised from
[1:32:07] the dead God's first corn of wheat that
[1:32:10] God's quickening power God had quickened
[1:32:12] his life raised him up from the dead and
[1:32:13] he was the first fruits of those that
[1:32:15] slept the first fruit he was that sheath
[1:32:18] he said that's why they had to wave that
[1:32:20] sheath for it was the first one to come
[1:32:21] to maturity and it was waved as a
[1:32:22] memorial of Thanksgiving to God
[1:32:24] believing the rest of them would come it
[1:32:25] was a sign he said he was waved on
[1:32:28] Easter he was waved again at Pentecost
[1:32:31] he said and to be waved again we realize
[1:32:32] in the last day according to Luke 17:30
[1:32:35] in the so n day again in the day that
[1:32:37] the so n of man will be revealed or

[1:33:02] with God and the Word was God and the
[1:33:03] Word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us

[1:33:07] in confirmation of the word of God by
[1:33:08] word of God by Signs by wonders we say
[1:33:10] today in the Book of Luke the 17th
[1:33:12] chapter and the 30th verse Malachi 4 the
[1:33:14] different scriptures we are acquainted

[1:37:12] second wave sheath was proof of a
[1:37:15] successful Harvest yes the first wave
[1:37:17] sheep was showing Christ was among them
[1:37:20] he had risen from the dead on Easter
[1:37:23] morning but the second wave sheep was
[1:37:25] proven that what Christ was all that
[1:37:27] Christ was he poured into the church
[1:37:30] proving that the resurrection work
[1:37:32] proving he had Justified them by faith
[1:37:34] and filled them with the Holy
[1:37:36] Ghost that's good where are we living
[1:37:40] Church the brandham said but the wheat
[1:37:43] has to lay in the presence of the sun to
[1:37:45] ripen that's what we're here for friend
[1:37:48] stay in the presence of the sun till our
[1:37:50] little group of people here till it
[1:37:52] become so ripe to Christ it become Bread
[1:37:56] on his
[1:37:57] table see that's the time we live in
[1:37:59] this is the time of the full word the
[1:38:01] full son you say brother Ben I have a
[1:38:02] hard time understanding that just think
[1:38:04] with me for a moment and and think with
[1:38:06] your heart in your spirit and and and
[1:38:09] with that understanding that God's giv
[1:38:11] you that the end time message means
[1:38:13] something to you you need to thinking
[1:38:15] all these things that I go through in
[1:38:16] life are for a purpose because this is
[1:38:19] the full word the full son have wanting
[1:38:22] to produce itself in my life
[1:38:24] Galatians 4:30 tells us that the son of
[1:38:27] the Bond woman will not be air with the
[1:38:29] son of the free woman random to us in
[1:38:31] the seed do not air with the Shu that
[1:38:33] Mary was not the seed she was the
[1:38:34] carrier and that Pentecost was the shook
[1:38:37] that must pull away and I've got I could
[1:38:40] I could preach for five hours today and
[1:38:42] I won't I
[1:38:47] promise we can need to redo that
[1:38:49] election I tell you
[1:38:52] what brother ste's okay
[1:38:54] he's me redo the other
[1:38:57] part
[1:39:00] but where was
[1:39:03] I oh I'm not going to keep you forever
[1:39:05] but I'm quoting this stuff so I some of
[1:39:07] this stuff I'm just quoting but it's
[1:39:08] from quotes you understand I'm just
[1:39:10] telling you to save time and now I'm
[1:39:12] taking
[1:39:13] time but look brother Brandon said the
[1:39:16] Pentecost was the shuck how many know
[1:39:18] that which must pull away but the real
[1:39:21] genuine bride Church
[1:39:24] will bring forth how much the entire
[1:39:28] word of God oh brother Josh I take that
[1:39:31] as a prophecy I believe he he meant that
[1:39:33] when he said it the entire word of God
[1:39:36] in what in its
[1:39:37] fullness in its strength not barely
[1:39:41] making it by the skin of her teeth but
[1:39:43] the real genuine bright church will be
[1:39:46] in its fullness and in his strength he's
[1:39:49] the same yesterday today and forever oh
[1:39:52] hope we believe that today yes amen he
[1:39:54] was the full seed see brother B taught
[1:39:57] us he said Mary was not the full seed
[1:39:59] she the seed was in her she protected it
[1:40:01] but she was not the full seed she
[1:40:04] manifested a part of the word a virgin
[1:40:05] shall conceive just like Pentecost
[1:40:07] manifested a part of the word the
[1:40:10] restoration of the gifts there had to be
[1:40:12] a part of the word manifested but they
[1:40:14] did not manifest the full word Christ
[1:40:16] was the manifestation of the for word he
[1:40:18] come and said in the volume of the book
[1:40:19] it's written to me and you and I live in
[1:40:21] the day when the real genuine wine bride
[1:40:23] church is a manifestation of the full
[1:40:26] word look now he said but notice and
[1:40:29] this is in the seat is not air with the
[1:40:31] sh at the opening of The Seven
[1:40:33] Seals Revelation 10 the how much
[1:40:39] forward so again what am I waiting
[1:40:42] on well I'm waiting brother Ben to get
[1:40:44] ready I'll get ready when I hear
[1:40:46] somebody preach no get ready today I'll
[1:40:50] get ready when some a certain thing
[1:40:52] happens no time to get today yeah
[1:40:54] because the for word someone say the for
[1:40:57] word is to be born in a manifestation
[1:41:00] again and Vindicated by the spirit of
[1:41:03] God in what in the full strength yes as
[1:41:06] it was when he was here on Earth
[1:41:08] manifested in the same way doing the
[1:41:10] same things that it did when he was here
[1:41:12] on the Earth all right and he goes to
[1:41:14] Hebrews 138 and Luke 17:30 again what is
[1:41:17] he telling us summer is here in fact for
[1:41:20] the church the summer is over
[1:41:24] right they're facing Harvest I want you
[1:41:28] to watch something have you got a few
[1:41:29] more minutes to listen with me we're
[1:41:31] actually doing good on
[1:41:33] time now summer is here if you go back
[1:41:37] in the Book of Ruth you find that Ruth's
[1:41:39] courtship began at Barley season right
[1:41:43] brother brandham notes that he said it
[1:41:45] began at at Barley season at the
[1:41:47] beginning of the Harvest Ruth 122 say
[1:41:50] naom Naomi returned and Ruth the
[1:41:52] moabitas her daughter-in-law with her
[1:41:54] which returned out of the country of
[1:41:55] Moab and they came to Bethlehem when in
[1:41:57] the beginning of barley
[1:42:00] harvest the entire courtship of Ruth
[1:42:04] happens during the
[1:42:06] Harvest at the beginning of the Harvest
[1:42:09] she's a
[1:42:10] moabitas right and she commits herself
[1:42:15] to the word to Naomi and says where you
[1:42:18] go I'll go that's her legalistic phase
[1:42:20] right where you where you go I'll go
[1:42:23] Ruth committing herself to that and she
[1:42:25] goes to Bethlehem and it's the beginning
[1:42:28] of barley Harvest by the end of the
[1:42:30] wheat Harvest which The Barley Harvest
[1:42:33] happens and then the wheat Harvest then
[1:42:35] she's married to

[1:43:15] her don't go in another field I've told
[1:43:16] the young men not to touch you he began
[1:43:18] to drop handfuls on purpose for her

[1:46:19] resting waiting for the coming of her
[1:46:21] Lord yes
[1:46:23] amen Lutheran age brother brand said was
[1:46:26] the
[1:46:27] springtime and watch how late it
[1:46:29] is look remember I dropped that in the
[1:46:33] church for the church Summers
[1:46:36] ended there's no more hope for the
[1:46:39] Church of ever being
[1:46:43] revived the Lutheran age was Springtime
[1:46:45] wesleying age summer of growth Le AG
[1:46:49] just Harvest Time was at the end of the
[1:46:51] summer Gathering the tears for binding
[1:46:54] and burning garnishing the wheat for the
[1:46:56] Lord garnering the wheat for the lord
[1:47:00] it's time for the Harvest to be finished
[1:47:02] you say well what what's what gets in
[1:47:03] the way with the landing you know what
[1:47:05] he's waiting on when the Jewish age was
[1:47:08] fixed into close now listen closely when
[1:47:11] the Jewish age is fixing to close Jesus
[1:47:14] tells his disciples he said something
[1:47:16] needs to happen look pull up that next
[1:47:18] scripture put it on there and he said
[1:47:21] this to his disciples he said the
[1:47:23] Harvest is plenteous it's harvest time
[1:47:27] remember that Jewish age he told him
[1:47:28] don't go to the Gentiles go to the Jews
[1:47:30] because it was ending that was it it was
[1:47:34] go it was switching over to the Gentiles
[1:47:36] the Harvest truly is plenteous but the
[1:47:39] laborers are
[1:47:40] few pray ye therefore the lord of the
[1:47:44] Harvest he'll send forth laborers into
[1:47:48] his
[1:47:49] Harvest Right people who are willing
[1:47:52] while they're resting in the Holy Ghost
[1:47:53] in their own soul to go out and work for
[1:47:56] the kingdom of God not because they're
[1:47:58] made to not because they have to do it
[1:47:59] to eat but because Boaz is providing
[1:48:02] amen and they want to share what they've
[1:48:05] been provided so they go out and so it's
[1:48:07] the time of the going out you say well
[1:48:10] this is the age we don't need no more
[1:48:11] preachers no the Harvest Time was when
[1:48:13] he said go out into the Harvest all
[1:48:15] right if there ever was a time for
[1:48:17] preachers to preach Now's the
[1:48:20] Time amen pray and brother said he was
[1:48:23] the lord of the Harvest he told the
[1:48:25] disciples you ask we have not because we
[1:48:28] ask not you ask God send forth labors I
[1:48:31] know some people think well preachers
[1:48:33] are the problem but we need more of
[1:48:35] them not less more good
[1:48:38] ones more that live right more that
[1:48:40] dedicate themselves to the
[1:48:42] message labors into his
[1:48:45] Harvest this age is the last of the
[1:48:47] seven Church ages this is the latest in
[1:48:50] church age in in in the church age book
[1:48:54] what began in the first or Ephesian age
[1:48:55] must and will come to full fruition and
[1:48:58] harvest in the last or leoan age the two
[1:49:01] Vines will yield their final fruit final
[1:49:04] fruit two spirits will terminate their
[1:49:06] manifestation in each of their final
[1:49:10] destination the sewing the watering the
[1:49:14] growing oh God where are we at church
[1:49:17] it's all
[1:49:18] over the only life still still happening
[1:49:23] the only movement is on the inside of
[1:49:26] the
[1:49:27] seed summer is ended the sickle is now
[1:49:31] thrust into the
[1:49:33] Harvest Now the ages are actually
[1:49:35] blending together brother Bram taught
[1:49:37] that in in the church age book he talks
[1:49:39] about the overlapping ages he talk he
[1:49:40] said the Philadelphian age he
[1:49:43] says lasted till almost the end of the
[1:49:46] lean age it's a summer right he said it
[1:49:49] lasted to the end and it just runs out
[1:49:52] he said overlaps so he said the
[1:49:54] Philadelphia H is about run its course
[1:49:56] lat C and H quickly comes in bringing
[1:49:58] both the tear and the wheat to harvest
[1:49:59] first buying the tears to burn them but
[1:50:01] gather the weed into my barn he said
[1:50:03] remember that the sardian age started
[1:50:05] the reformation and must still go on
[1:50:07] until the grain that was planted at
[1:50:08] Pentecost goes through the full cycle of
[1:50:11] planting watering nourishing Etc until
[1:50:14] it comes right back to Original
[1:50:17] Seed I believe what brother B taught in
[1:50:19] the church age book is true but this is
[1:50:20] kind of humorous uh everyone say well
[1:50:22] where where can you find Lee Vil you
[1:50:24] know Le Veil must have put something of
[1:50:25] his own in there it was Etc that's what
[1:50:27] Lee Vil put in
[1:50:30] there I don't think that was brother
[1:50:32] Brandon but he grammar IED it for him I
[1:50:33] believe it's the
[1:50:35] truth now look he said while this is
[1:50:37] going on the tears that were swn will
[1:50:40] have to go through their cycle and be
[1:50:42] harvested also they go through that
[1:50:44] cycle you said that is exactly what we
[1:50:46] see happening if you can just think of
[1:50:48] the seasons you can get a very good
[1:50:49] picture of this the plant that you see
[1:50:51] growing in full strength in summer
[1:50:53] suddenly appears to be going to seed you
[1:50:56] can't tell exactly when summer became
[1:50:59] Autumn it just faded into it that is how
[1:51:02] the ages are and especially these last
[1:51:07] two Gentile ages running
[1:51:10] out what happened the Gentile ages
[1:51:13] remember the great I'm I'm throwing a
[1:51:15] lot in this morning but I hope we can
[1:51:16] catch pick up parts of it
[1:51:19] look Daniel 235 he sees the image of
[1:51:23] gold remember at the head of
[1:51:25] gold and it and it went all the way down
[1:51:27] to the feet it was iron and Clay mixed
[1:51:29] together what was that it represented
[1:51:31] the Gentile kingdoms are you still awake
[1:51:33] this morning the Gentile kingdoms what
[1:51:36] was happening the Gentile ages are
[1:51:38] almost over how do we know that it's
[1:51:40] summertime yes because what happens to
[1:51:43] the Gentile ages that Stone come out of
[1:51:45] the mountain without hands remember and
[1:51:47] Crush that's Christ I believe oh Church
[1:51:51] he's here in his full strength
[1:51:53] and it said during that time the iron
[1:51:54] the clay the brass the silver the gold
[1:51:56] broke into pieces together and became
[1:51:58] like what like the chaff of the summer
[1:52:00] threshing floor and the wind carried
[1:52:03] them away oh my they would purposely oh
[1:52:07] Church they would purposely exposed the
[1:52:09] Harvest to the wind so that the wind
[1:52:11] would blow away everything that was not
[1:52:14] heavy everything that oh everything that
[1:52:18] was not in Revival from the latter rain
[1:52:20] are you with me now everything that
[1:52:22] didn't did not have get that moisture
[1:52:23] everything was all blown away everything
[1:52:26] that the life had left blew away what
[1:52:29] was left the Original Seed all right
[1:52:32] Hallelujah no place was found for them
[1:52:35] and the stone that smoke the image
[1:52:36] become a great mountain and filled the
[1:52:38] whole earth during this time the church
[1:52:40] goes down into tribulation what can the
[1:52:43] church say today but what Jeremiah said
[1:52:45] as he saw the the Israelite age those
[1:52:48] Kingdom age of the two kingdoms ending
[1:52:51] he says this he said the heart Harvest
[1:52:52] has passed the summer has ended we're
[1:52:56] not
[1:52:57] saved for the church brother brand
[1:53:00] talked about the preview of the church
[1:53:01] and how that that church was so awful he
[1:53:04] said first he saw the bride and then he
[1:53:06] saw the church and it was so awful he
[1:53:08] said it was just going down to dancing
[1:53:11] almost in nudity to rock and roll music
[1:53:14] remember they were going down but he
[1:53:16] said is that all I produced that's the
[1:53:19] Church of America is that all I produced
[1:53:21] and he said the bride must come again
[1:53:25] and when the Bride come back the second
[1:53:26] time brother BR looks at that and he
[1:53:28] said life get in the
[1:53:30] grain Oh my he tells them to get back
[1:53:33] and step it does not mean that the bride
[1:53:36] is in some cold formal condition just
[1:53:38] waiting to be rescued but she's been
[1:53:40] restored back to the original grain just
[1:53:42] getting that last bit of shaft to be
[1:53:43] blown away that last bit of carnality
[1:53:46] that last bit of
[1:53:47] greenness to be taken out of
[1:53:50] her look all the life is in her all that
[1:53:54] he is she is and she bows herself in
[1:53:57] worship to the king
