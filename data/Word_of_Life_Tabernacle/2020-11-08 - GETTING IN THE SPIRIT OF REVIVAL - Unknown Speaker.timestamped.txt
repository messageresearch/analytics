[43:45] Jesus name amen
[43:48] amen God bless you you can be seated for
[43:51] just a
[43:52] moment I wanted to say a couple of
[43:54] things before we get started um I want
[43:57] to thank you for for this the church
[44:00] bought this for me and his iPad and and
[44:02] keyboard and I appreciate that very much
[44:04] for the pastor appreciation day you may
[44:06] not realize that you bought it but you
[44:08] bought it for me and I I really do
[44:10] appreciate that thank you for that and
[44:12] Brother David for doing that heading
[44:14] that up
[44:16] um I uh had told most of you and I sent
[44:19] some of you pictures I didn't bring them
[44:21] with me this morning but um there was a
[44:24] super typhoon in the Philippines of
[44:25] course the news here uh in this country
[44:28] has been so crazy lately that we don't
[44:30] look much at what's happening in other
[44:32] parts of the world and they had one of
[44:34] the worst typhoons that they've ever had
[44:36] in the Philippines uh last week and so
[44:39] there were believers who were uh
[44:41] impacted by that and I got a message
[44:45] from a brother that I'd preached for
[44:47] there that they had had a a very large
[44:49] impact I feel like I'm echoing Peter if
[44:51] you turn me down just a little bit
[44:54] um they had had a great impact
[44:57] um from that and uh some of their houses
[45:00] blown away and things and we were able
[45:01] to send them $2,000 out of the mission
[45:04] fund um to help them with that that'll
[45:07] go a long ways in that country to
[45:09] rebuild it'll probably rebuild several
[45:10] homes for that for that amount of money
[45:13] and and I felt like we should help them
[45:15] and we had the ability to do it so thank
[45:17] you for your commitment to give to
[45:19] missions and to do that and we were able
[45:21] to help them just just over a couple
[45:23] days they had the money so that uh that
[45:26] was such a blessing to be able to do
[45:27] that and thank you for all of you who
[45:30] have given to missions to be able to do
[45:31] that uh everything we do here we have a
[45:34] part in other parts of the world we're
[45:36] not just isolated here we have a part
[45:38] over there as well and uh maybe sometime
[45:41] we'll get when all this coron virus
[45:43] passes we'll get the pastor there to
[45:45] come and and speak for us if he's in in
[45:47] the US able to do
[45:50] that um on November 22nd we'll have two
[45:54] Services two services that day with
[45:57] brother Aaron Oglesby on November 22nd
[45:59] with dinner between the services and uh
[46:02] I'd like for us to have a just a special
[46:03] day that day if we could that'll be the
[46:05] week before Thanksgiving we will not
[46:07] have service the Wednesday night before
[46:09] Thanksgiving so keep that in mind uh but
[46:12] we'll have two services that Sunday
[46:13] brother Aon ogles be be speaking he a
[46:15] great great preacher and then um we I'd
[46:19] like to have like I said a special
[46:20] dinner of some kind you may not want
[46:21] turkey but if we could do something you
[46:23] ladies will come up with something but
[46:25] may not want to spoil your Thanksgiving
[46:27] by having turkey the Sunday before um
[46:30] but we'll we'll plan on that uh remember
[46:32] tonight is communion but the Colby
[46:33] Martin will be with us tonight I know
[46:35] some of you come to hear him this
[46:37] morning but um he'll be here this
[46:40] afternoon at 3 o'cl if you can hang
[46:41] around to that service he'll be
[46:42] preaching for us and then uh um he'll be
[46:46] uh we'll have our communion service
[46:48] after that service and we'll give you a
[46:50] chance we're going to do foot washing
[46:51] but if you're not comfortable doing that
[46:53] I understand in the current climate uh
[46:56] if you're not comfortable doing that
[46:57] we'll give you a chance to be dismissed
[46:59] from the service before we do foot
[47:01] washing so if you're not going to be a
[47:03] part of the foot Washing Service go
[47:04] ahead and come to the service and we'll
[47:06] give you a chance to be dismissed from
[47:07] that and then we'll do foot washing
[47:09] after the
[47:10] service I want to say this in regards to
[47:13] the presidential election and I know
[47:15] that's the last thing you want to hear
[47:16] about this morning is the election so
[47:18] this is all I'm going to say about it
[47:20] but they uh have declared Biden the
[47:22] winner and he would be the first
[47:25] Catholic President since Kennedy of
[47:27] course they're still counting the votes
[47:28] there'll be a legal wrangling it may
[47:30] change but and perhaps it would and and
[47:35] God is in control of that but if he does
[47:37] get elected he'd be the first Catholic
[47:39] President since Kennedy you remember
[47:41] brother brandham thought that we
[47:42] wouldn't have another Protestant
[47:43] president after Kennedy go look it up
[47:46] brother brandham said that he felt like
[47:48] there would not be another Protestant
[47:49] president we've had nothing but Pro
[47:51] Protestant president since and you look
[47:54] at the time that's passed and the things
[47:56] that's happened he would be the first
[47:57] Catholic President and having a woman as
[48:00] a vice
[48:01] president there have only been 15
[48:04] Catholic Supreme Court justices in the
[48:06] history of the Supreme
[48:07] Court six of them six out of nine are
[48:10] serving right
[48:12] now we're we're we're living in that
[48:14] time and if you look at what brother
[48:15] brandham the things brother brandham
[48:17] talked about and then you look at today
[48:19] those things were seeds then and it's
[48:22] come into maturity today and you can see
[48:24] it everything that he says about
[48:26] homosexuality on the increase about the
[48:28] the insanity of the people all the
[48:29] things brother brandom talks about now
[48:31] we're we're seeing it come to
[48:33] pass and and I I want to read you this
[48:36] quote brother brandom says he says this
[48:38] is a woman's nation and this is actually
[48:41] on the on the slides if you want to pull
[48:43] that up the first quote he said this is
[48:45] the woman's Nation it's the number 13 it
[48:46] appears in the 13th chapter of
[48:48] Revelation 13 stars 13 stripes he said
[48:51] everything's 13 everything is a woman he
[48:53] said remember thus sayith the Lord there
[48:55] will be a woman rule before the end time
[48:57] said she'll either be president vice
[48:59] president or it'll be the Catholic
[49:01] Church as a woman he said I've seen her
[49:03] a great woman the nation bowed to her he
[49:06] said it'll be one before the end time
[49:07] thus sayith the Lord write it down find
[49:09] out you young people see if it happens
[49:12] he said if it isn't I'm a false prophet
[49:14] you said brother Ben what does that mean
[49:16] I don't know but I know this it's later
[49:18] than we
[49:20] think get your house in order like the
[49:22] prophet said set your house in order
[49:24] it's later than we think am amen it's
[49:27] about time to go home aren't you ready
[49:28] to go home amen God bless you uh stand
[49:32] with me and turn to 2 Kings chapter 3
[49:33] and:
[49:39] 13 2 Kings chapter 3 and verse 13 and
[49:45] we'll we'll read from
[49:48] there good to have the Jacksons with us
[49:50] this morning we uh these kids um grew up
[49:55] with me as their youth pastor
[49:57] um or assist associate over there and
[50:00] and uh so we got a lot of a lot in
[50:02] common and spent a lot of time together
[50:04] they probably didn't want to come hear
[50:05] me this morning but brother Colby will
[50:08] be here this afternoon so if you can
[50:09] hang around and uh and come this
[50:12] afternoon that'd be good thank the Lord
[50:14] for good friends wherever we go and I'm
[50:17] glad for Fellowship too I believe we can
[50:19] have Fellowship without all the drama
[50:21] and without all the CR slighting and
[50:22] things like that I believe God wants us
[50:24] to have Fellowship one with another with
[50:26] the church churches we're all in we're
[50:28] headed the same direction and you know
[50:30] there's too few of us to fight there's
[50:33] not enough of us left to fight with one
[50:35] another we need to be one with one
[50:37] another so we thank God for brother Ivy
[50:38] and the church there and and all the
[50:41] folks there that we are so close to over
[50:42] the years 2 Kings chapter 3 and verse 13
[50:47] and Elisha said unto the king of Israel
[50:48] what have I to do with thee get thee to
[50:51] the prophets of thy father and to the
[50:53] prophets of thy mother and the king of
[50:54] Israel said unto him nay Lord Lord ha
[50:56] called these three kings together to
[50:58] deliver them into the hand of Moab and
[51:00] Elisha said as the Lord of hosts liveth
[51:02] before whom I stand surely were it not
[51:05] that I regard the presence of
[51:06] Jehoshaphat king of Judah I would not
[51:09] look toward thee nor see thee but now
[51:11] bring me a minstril and it came to pass
[51:13] when the minstril played that the hand
[51:16] of the Lord came upon him and he said
[51:18] thus saith the Lord make this Valley
[51:20] full of ditches for thus sayith the Lord
[51:22] You shall not see wind neither shall you
[51:24] see rain yet that Valley shall be filled
[51:27] with water and that you might may drink
[51:30] both ye and your cattle and your beast
[51:31] and this is but a light thing in the
[51:33] sight of the Lord he will deliver the
[51:35] moabites also into your hand I pray the
[51:39] Lord would add his Blessing to the word
[51:40] you may be
[51:42] seated this
[51:47] morning I want to title this getting in
[51:49] the spirit of Revival and brother
[51:52] Brandon makes this statement in making
[51:53] the valley full of ditches he said we
[51:55] can never have a Revival in shreport or
[51:58] anywhere else until the church gets in
[52:01] the spirit of
[52:03] Revival he says God can come and perform
[52:06] Miracles he can show wonders he can
[52:08] stretch forth his hand to heal the sick
[52:09] and The Afflicted the preacher can
[52:11] preach the gospel as hard as he can but
[52:14] there will never be a Revival until the
[52:17] church gets in the spirit of
[52:20] Revival and so brother Brandon preached
[52:22] a message called getting in the spirit
[52:24] and and some of the things I'm going to
[52:25] say today are drawn from that and we
[52:27] find that in our text that the armies of
[52:30] Israel and Judah had been marching
[52:32] through the land for seven days and
[52:35] brother brandom tells us that as they
[52:36] marched through the land they didn't uh
[52:38] they went straight across country the
[52:40] Bible says they took a compass and just
[52:42] marched through the land in a in a
[52:44] general direction because they were so
[52:46] sure of their victory over the king of
[52:48] Moab as they go come along they realized
[52:51] that they had forgot to bring water with
[52:52] them and the land that they were going
[52:54] through was very dry and brother random
[52:56] tells us that as they went through that
[52:57] country as as the farther they went the
[53:00] drier it got so as they were going along
[53:04] that they would see you know the
[53:05] greenery and the fruits and all the
[53:07] trees and the beauty of that part of
[53:09] Israel but as they begin to get into the
[53:10] desert began to get very dry and brother
[53:13] random said that was that seventh day
[53:15] that they begin to see that that the
[53:17] farther they got the drier it got let me
[53:19] tell you today church that that's that's
[53:22] where we're living we're living in that
[53:24] time in that seventh day when at the end
[53:26] of it it seems like there's no fruit
[53:29] anywhere there's no um there there's no
[53:32] seems like no peace no joy no love all
[53:34] these things that should be there random
[53:36] said the fruits of the spirit were
[53:38] missing at the end time they were
[53:40] missing and and we can go back into the
[53:43] bride tree and talk about how that the
[53:45] the caterpillar and all these other
[53:47] these worm this worm ate away at the
[53:48] bride tree until it it it got rid of the
[53:50] leaves it got rid of the fruit it got
[53:52] rid of everything it was just a stump
[53:54] and now we see it coming back but he
[53:56] said the farther they got the drier it
[53:58] got there was no joy no no peace and
[54:00] Galatians 5:22 tells us what those
[54:03] fruits of the spirit are he said but the
[54:05] fruit of the spirit is love joy peace
[54:07] longsuffering gentleness goodness Faith
[54:10] meekness Temperance against such there
[54:12] is no law during that seventh day you
[54:14] couldn't find those
[54:17] things during that time the love of many
[54:19] the Bible says grows
[54:21] cold have we ever lived in a time like
[54:24] that the love of many the love for one
[54:25] another
[54:26] grows cold the brotherly love that ought
[54:29] to be for among Ministry among the
[54:32] people among even families it's just not
[54:35] there why it's it's wax cold that that
[54:38] that's what the scripture said the King
[54:39] James version said wax cold it means it
[54:41] grew
[54:42] cold it slowly got cold it didn't just
[54:45] get there all at once but slowly the
[54:47] love was gone and that's the way it
[54:49] happens is as they went farther and
[54:51] further along they realized there was no
[54:53] love they go farther and farther along
[54:55] they realize there was no no joy even
[54:57] among Christians you ever notice today
[55:00] everybody's always either angry or
[55:02] [Music]
[55:03] sad
[55:05] huh unless there's some kind of Comedy
[55:08] or some kind of false humor to be able
[55:09] to lighten the
[55:11] mood right brother random called that
[55:13] whistling in the in the dark whistling
[55:15] in a graveyard because they realize that
[55:18] it's going through a time when uh you
[55:20] know when the world's going through a
[55:21] horrible time but now people people are
[55:23] either mad or or they're or they're sad
[55:26] all the time they wake up that way and
[55:27] and that affects us as well but Christ
[55:30] there's joy in Christ there's still joy
[55:33] that fruit is still valid today even
[55:35] though there's no Revival anywhere it
[55:37] seems like but that fruit is still valid
[55:39] that fruit of
[55:40] joy joy is even gone among Christians
[55:43] peace is
[55:44] gone peace has vanished as we travel
[55:47] along we realize that people are
[55:50] troubled constantly troubled by what
[55:52] might happen by what is happening by
[55:54] what tomorrow holds
[55:56] and we'd be so much better off if we
[55:58] just leave it in his
[56:00] hands we'd be so much better off if we
[56:02] just let him
[56:04] drive right you know how that is when
[56:06] you sit there I had a my older brother
[56:09] when we were younger he would never he
[56:11] he could not sleep while someone else
[56:13] was driving so we would travel across
[56:16] the country and he would he would stay
[56:17] up just watching and telling me how to
[56:19] drive the whole way well he could never
[56:21] drive because he was always
[56:23] tired because he' always stayed up while
[56:25] I drove
[56:27] and and driving out west and and places
[56:29] where we would go and and it always
[56:31] irritated me because he he's so
[56:32] stressful about it but that's the way we
[56:34] live our lives sometimes God's in the
[56:37] driver's seat and we're sitting there
[56:38] trying to keep awake make sure he does
[56:40] his
[56:41] job make sure he doesn't go off the
[56:43] wrong exit listen he's not going to take
[56:44] a wrong
[56:46] exit you know the the sanctity of the
[56:49] Bride the fact that there's going to be
[56:51] a bride without spot or wrinkle at the
[56:52] end time it's not up to
[56:54] me right it's not going to be up to me
[56:56] it's going to be up to God God did that
[56:58] and he'll call the ministry that it
[56:59] takes he'll he'll have a church he'll
[57:01] have the people there it won't be up to
[57:03] me to make sure it's all right are you
[57:05] with me now and if we put that on
[57:07] ourselves all it does is stress us out
[57:09] where we have no peace and heart attacks
[57:11] we find out on the increase and the
[57:13] Bible says men's hearts are failing for
[57:15] fear why that's the time that we live in
[57:18] and the people of Israel and Judah the
[57:20] the children of God found themselves in
[57:22] that condition and when they got in that
[57:25] condition josaphat being a Godly King he
[57:28] began to look for a prophet of the Lord
[57:31] he said surely there's a prophet of the
[57:33] Lord when we see the things that are
[57:35] going on around us we ought to look at a
[57:37] the message a prophet brought surely
[57:40] there's a word that come from God surely
[57:42] there's something that we can have
[57:44] confidence in that we can know whether
[57:45] or not we'll
[57:47] live you say well how will we know
[57:50] whether we'll make it the he's he taught
[57:52] us that the end time bride would not
[57:54] fall how could we fall if we belong to
[57:57] God how could he lose one as we talked
[58:00] about Wednesday night it would be a
[58:01] stain on his character to lose
[58:04] one he said I haven't lost one but the
[58:06] son of predition Amen now look jhat
[58:10] began to look for a prophet he said
[58:12] where's our prophet of the Lord and they
[58:13] said well there's one here used to used
[58:15] to carry El Elijah's baggage he used to
[58:18] be Elijah's servant so they went to
[58:20] Elisha's
[58:22] house because true Revival always takes
[58:25] you back to the word if you're looking
[58:26] for Revival go back to the
[58:29] word now when they got there though it's
[58:32] interesting
[58:33] because Elisha wasn't in the mood or the
[58:36] frame of mind to be able to receive them
[58:38] like he should
[58:42] have so Elisha's got a bad case of the
[58:46] Monday doldrums or whatever we might
[58:48] call it the Monday
[58:49] [Music]
[58:51] blues he's not
[58:54] happy and there's several reasons for it
[58:56] and the first being because he's a human
[59:01] being and the fact is the number one
[59:04] reason why and you can write this down
[59:06] or just keep it in your mind whatever
[59:08] but the number one reason why that you
[59:10] have to get in the spirit is because
[59:12] you're in the
[59:14] flesh we live in the flesh right that's
[59:18] where we operate and so we have to get
[59:20] in the spirit or we have a problem
[59:22] because the flesh is always with us
[59:26] right and every day you find yourself
[59:28] having to battle back out of that every
[59:30] day you find yourself having to work
[59:32] your way back out of that so the flesh
[59:34] is always there now so his Humanity
[59:38] caused him to be able to have to get in
[59:40] the spirit now brother brand says this
[59:42] in the church age book he said have you
[59:44] ever noticed how the world gets into the
[59:45] spirit of things that are in the world
[59:47] he said they go to their ball games
[59:49] their sporting events their dances they
[59:51] enter into the spirit of
[59:54] it and brother bandom talks about about
[59:56] that how that if you were a person who
[59:58] going to a dance he said and wouldn't
[1:00:00] dance he wouldn't get in the spirit of
[1:00:01] it you wouldn't
[1:00:02] go that's why a lot of people don't go
[1:00:04] to church they don't get ever get in the
[1:00:07] spirit of it don't ever get in the
[1:00:09] spirit so they enter into the spirit of
[1:00:10] it they don't sit there like wall
[1:00:11] flowers he said old dried up
[1:00:15] sticks right who goes to a place like
[1:00:18] that let me tell you this I I don't want
[1:00:20] to make people come to church I want you
[1:00:22] to want to be
[1:00:24] here I have to make be here it doesn't
[1:00:26] do you any good
[1:00:28] anyhow right if I had to if I had to
[1:00:30] convince you and force you to come then
[1:00:32] and the word ought to do that I
[1:00:33] shouldn't have to do that the word ought
[1:00:35] to convince us we ought to be in the
[1:00:36] house of God and I know it's not always
[1:00:38] easy especially the the link that some
[1:00:40] of you have to drive and different
[1:00:41] things that you do but there's something
[1:00:42] in your heart why do you do that because
[1:00:44] there's something inside of you you
[1:00:46] you're in the spirit of it you want to
[1:00:48] be part of it and so brother B said they
[1:00:50] enter right into the feel of things and
[1:00:52] become a part of things but oh how they
[1:00:54] hate the Christians for getting into
[1:00:55] this Spirit of God's word they call us
[1:00:58] Fanatics and holy rollers there's
[1:01:00] nothing they won't do to show their
[1:01:02] hatred and
[1:01:04] disapproval he said but ignore
[1:01:07] that ignore that you can expect it
[1:01:10] knowing where it is coming from just go
[1:01:13] on and get in the spirit of worship he
[1:01:16] said our spirit is clean it is fresh it
[1:01:18] is real it is sober and serious but
[1:01:20] nonetheless full of the joy of the Lord
[1:01:24] amen he said the Christian listen ought
[1:01:26] to be just as exuberant and full of his
[1:01:29] pleasure in the Lord as the world is
[1:01:32] when it Savers and delights in its
[1:01:36] Pleasures now that's saying something I
[1:01:39] remember some years ago I was at
[1:01:42] someone's house I was watching a a ball
[1:01:45] game and they had a ball game on and it
[1:01:48] was a playoff game and it was very cold
[1:01:51] very very
[1:01:52] cold and I'll never forget that because
[1:01:54] it was something like they kept showing
[1:01:56] the temperature it was it was minus it
[1:01:58] was under 0 deg and it was in Green Bay
[1:02:02] actually and and I think it was if I
[1:02:05] remember right it was Brett Favre's last
[1:02:07] game and I remember it because of this
[1:02:10] that there were people in the stands who
[1:02:13] had painted their
[1:02:15] chests and these guys had painted them
[1:02:18] Green Bay or Packers whatever that it
[1:02:20] was on their chest and they took their
[1:02:21] shirt off in that freezing weather
[1:02:26] and and the whole game the the camera
[1:02:28] kept going back to these guys that that
[1:02:30] had their shirts off in this weather and
[1:02:32] I'm thinking you guys are crazy you
[1:02:34] would have to be absolutely crazy and
[1:02:36] maybe they were just a little bit
[1:02:38] inebriated to do
[1:02:41] that but they were in the spirit of it I
[1:02:44] mean what possessed them you think about
[1:02:46] that you get up in the morning say today
[1:02:48] I'm GNA go out in the
[1:02:49] cold and I'm going to I'm going to paint
[1:02:52] take off my shirt and paint my body a
[1:02:55] certain color because I want to support
[1:02:57] my team they paint their face and their
[1:02:59] body and everything else why they're in
[1:03:01] the spirit of that they spend thousands
[1:03:03] of dollars on it they they spent all
[1:03:06] this money to buy a ticket and to go and
[1:03:08] to be there and then they sit to the
[1:03:10] cold and the rain and the wind and then
[1:03:12] that team
[1:03:15] lost and see we we are on the winning
[1:03:19] side and we haven't asked nobody to take
[1:03:21] your shirt off and
[1:03:23] paint ask you to take the paint off
[1:03:28] we haven't asked you to do anything like
[1:03:29] that all we ask you to do is come sit in
[1:03:31] the presence of the Lord receive from
[1:03:33] God you don't you come to church and God
[1:03:36] just gives and gives and gives and gives
[1:03:38] blessings to you and people say well I
[1:03:40] just don't want to go I'd rather because
[1:03:41] you're not in the spirit of
[1:03:44] it but now brother says both Christians
[1:03:47] and the world are human remember Elisha
[1:03:48] is human that's why he has to get in the
[1:03:50] spirit both Christians and the world are
[1:03:52] human both have emotions the difference
[1:03:54] is the Christians hearts and emotions
[1:03:56] are purely on The Lord Of Glory and his
[1:03:58] love while the world satisfies the
[1:04:02] flesh Elisha's
[1:04:05] Humanity got in the way it caused him to
[1:04:07] be
[1:04:08] angry I think it's important that we
[1:04:10] don't blame God for our nature I've said
[1:04:12] that before but it's something I've
[1:04:13] always I was convinced at a young age
[1:04:15] that it was important that I didn't
[1:04:17] blame God for what I did
[1:04:19] wrong right or accuse him of blessing
[1:04:23] something that was not right
[1:04:26] I'm not going to accuse him of blessing
[1:04:28] something that is
[1:04:29] sin right and most of the time now I
[1:04:32] don't say all the time because we've
[1:04:33] seen it before where you know and
[1:04:35] brother brandom talks about how Jesus
[1:04:37] Took the the Whip and you know he could
[1:04:39] do that I don't know of another person
[1:04:41] on the earth that could do that not get
[1:04:42] in the
[1:04:45] flesh he didn't never sin and there is a
[1:04:49] place for righteous indignation in one
[1:04:50] place brother brand said Elisha had that
[1:04:52] righteous indignation but even that
[1:04:54] righteous indignation took him out of
[1:04:55] the spirit of
[1:04:58] God so he had to have you know and and
[1:05:01] we get to thinking that well it's just
[1:05:03] the way I am God Made Me This Way well
[1:05:05] that's true to a point but you you know
[1:05:08] Satan sprayed that spray over you and
[1:05:10] and whatever you have if you got a
[1:05:12] temper that's out of control that's not
[1:05:15] God right if you're arrogant that's not
[1:05:17] a
[1:05:18] virtue right if you can't get along with
[1:05:21] people that's not you being a some kind
[1:05:23] of prophet or something it's just you
[1:05:25] being car
[1:05:27] cuz even when the prophets had that
[1:05:29] problem it was them being
[1:05:32] carnal right and so brother brandom
[1:05:34] tells us about Elisha and the children
[1:05:36] is a good example that Elisha when those
[1:05:38] kids come out and said oh Baldhead and
[1:05:41] and Elisha put a curse on those children
[1:05:42] in the name of the Lord and before they
[1:05:44] got home he said two she Bears killed 42
[1:05:46] innocent children he said now that ain't
[1:05:49] the nature of the Holy Spirit he said
[1:05:51] but it was the prophet angered and even
[1:05:52] God backed it
[1:05:54] up sure cuz because he was still a
[1:05:57] prophet absolutely he was still a
[1:05:59] prophet but it was the prophet anger it
[1:06:00] wasn't the nature of the Holy
[1:06:02] Spirit you take brother brandham gave us
[1:06:04] that example of the attorneys you look
[1:06:06] at that and say why would brother
[1:06:07] brandham tell us that well I think it's
[1:06:08] wonderful that he told us that because
[1:06:10] it tells us that how honest he was and
[1:06:13] also how timid the holy spirit
[1:06:15] is that brother brandom says something
[1:06:17] that we wouldn't maybe even think about
[1:06:19] but I was always careful because brother
[1:06:21] brand told that story in business
[1:06:23] because everywhere I've ever worked in
[1:06:25] an office the manager the boss whoever
[1:06:27] it was would do that they would say tell
[1:06:30] them I'm not here everywhere I've ever
[1:06:33] worked somebody called they didn't want
[1:06:34] to talk to so every time you call in
[1:06:36] somewhere want to talk to somebody
[1:06:37] they're not here you wonder why are they
[1:06:39] never at office because they've been
[1:06:41] told to say
[1:06:43] that and I always told when I become a
[1:06:46] manager at the office I told him I said
[1:06:47] don't do that I won't do that because I
[1:06:50] was sensitive to that because of what
[1:06:51] brother brandham said about it but
[1:06:53] brother brandham talks about how that
[1:06:54] those attorneys called to tell him I'm
[1:06:56] not here and he went out the door which
[1:06:58] was strictly true he wasn't there no
[1:06:59] more but it was it was a white lie we
[1:07:02] might say brother random went to pray
[1:07:05] for a young a child to be healed and
[1:07:08] couldn't pray for
[1:07:11] them think about this for a minute a
[1:07:13] prophet of God with a gift of healing
[1:07:15] and everything else but he didn't push
[1:07:17] through
[1:07:18] that he went back and went and prayed
[1:07:21] for hours and hours until he finally
[1:07:23] broke through and then he was able to go
[1:07:25] back can pray for that
[1:07:28] child Elisha had to get quiet in his
[1:07:30] spirit before he could get in the spirit
[1:07:32] of God and this is
[1:07:33] important brother brother sister the
[1:07:35] trouble of it is today that people don't
[1:07:36] have time to get before God and get
[1:07:38] still they got so many things to do they
[1:07:40] belong to this they got to do this they
[1:07:42] got to have this they got to go
[1:07:45] there we could fill that in the blanks
[1:07:47] couldn't
[1:07:48] we we've got so many things to do we
[1:07:51] belong to this we got to do this we got
[1:07:53] to have this you got to go there he said
[1:07:55] you you don't have
[1:07:56] time you don't have time brother brandom
[1:08:00] has always struck me brother brandom
[1:08:01] said that those priests that invited
[1:08:04] Jesus and didn't wash his feet he said
[1:08:06] those priests actually got too busy
[1:08:09] doing spiritual
[1:08:12] things doing things that were supposedly
[1:08:15] good things talking to each other and
[1:08:18] about the word probably and all these
[1:08:20] things but they were too busy to notice
[1:08:22] that Jesus come in with unwashed feet
[1:08:25] well God help us today he said the
[1:08:27] devil's took up all your time you got to
[1:08:29] do this and that and the other he said
[1:08:31] you don't have time to get still before
[1:08:32] God get quiet remember he said after all
[1:08:34] you're a
[1:08:35] nature you're a nature he said and after
[1:08:39] all nature gets quiet he said then the
[1:08:42] Dew begins to fall that refreshes and
[1:08:45] bring forth
[1:08:47] life and he says you are a nature
[1:08:50] yourself and when you get quiet and what
[1:08:54] he's talking about is not just to be
[1:08:55] quiet and not talk but to be quiet in
[1:08:57] your spirit you've got to take the time
[1:09:00] to get quiet and I have to remind myself
[1:09:03] of this constantly because those of you
[1:09:05] that that know me well you know that I
[1:09:07] I'm punctual I've always got to be on
[1:09:09] time and if if there's going to be
[1:09:10] something happening I've got to be there
[1:09:13] it bothers me terribly if I'm not on
[1:09:14] time for something and and it's just my
[1:09:17] human Spirit I'm a nature I have to get
[1:09:19] quiet I have to get away from that in
[1:09:21] order to hear from God sometimes said
[1:09:24] when you get quiet still before God then
[1:09:26] the de of Heaven begins to fall begins
[1:09:29] to
[1:09:30] refresh he said be still and know that I
[1:09:33] am God get get quiet and know get your
[1:09:35] spirit quiet so God can
[1:09:38] move we have to take a little bit of
[1:09:40] time I know it's
[1:09:41] hard but sometimes if we have to take a
[1:09:43] longer song service then we should do it
[1:09:45] but whatever it is that we have to get
[1:09:48] that quietness to come over our Spirits
[1:09:49] before we can hear the
[1:09:51] word because so many times we come in
[1:09:53] and we've been wrestling with the kids
[1:09:55] and maybe one of them threw up on
[1:09:56] somebody and and trying to get them to
[1:09:59] church and you've been dragging them
[1:10:00] some of you drive two or three hours and
[1:10:02] but even those of you that don't you get
[1:10:03] up and try to get them breakfast and get
[1:10:05] them get them here and and everything's
[1:10:07] hard it's always hard and if you're
[1:10:08] having a dinner or something at the
[1:10:09] church you got to bring your food it's
[1:10:11] hard especially on the on the ladies you
[1:10:14] got to take it a few minutes at least
[1:10:17] there's no law there's nothing in the
[1:10:18] scripture says you have to be here 30
[1:10:19] minutes early but take a take a minute
[1:10:22] and just get your spirit
[1:10:24] quiet huh
[1:10:26] get your spirit quiet let let that let
[1:10:28] that begin to soak in and let the word
[1:10:30] of God begin to come to your mind
[1:10:31] because you know you're about to hear
[1:10:33] the word and you want you want to be
[1:10:34] changed you want to be different you
[1:10:36] don't want to be so busy that you miss
[1:10:38] it what if he come
[1:10:39] by what if he come by this
[1:10:43] morning you ever think about that what
[1:10:45] if he come by and he sat in the corner
[1:10:47] of this church we were so busy we
[1:10:50] couldn't we couldn't wash his feet we
[1:10:53] were so busy we couldn't worship Him we
[1:10:55] were so busy we we we didn't we didn't
[1:10:57] even recognize he was there he come and
[1:10:59] gone you realize the Rapture will be
[1:11:00] like that one day it won't be this big
[1:11:03] event World shaken event it'll be just
[1:11:04] one here and one there one and they'll
[1:11:06] just be
[1:11:08] gone take take a minute and recognize
[1:11:11] his presence he's here with
[1:11:14] us and the other reason so he was human
[1:11:18] that's one reason but another reason why
[1:11:20] is there were three kinds of Believers
[1:11:23] there and the Bible tells us that the
[1:11:25] king of Israel went and the king of
[1:11:27] Judah and the king of
[1:11:29] Edom and so those three kinds of
[1:11:32] Believers were there the king of
[1:11:33] Israel was jehoram who was a make
[1:11:36] believer Jehoshaphat was a Believer and
[1:11:38] the king of Edom was not a Believer at
[1:11:40] all was an
[1:11:41] unbeliever you think about these things
[1:11:44] and you realize that Elisha had to get
[1:11:47] past
[1:11:48] that because he realized that he was
[1:11:51] going to be preaching to and thank you
[1:11:53] for praying for me this morning the Lord
[1:11:55] helping me this morning but you think
[1:11:57] about him trying to preach to them and
[1:12:01] realizing he's angry because jehoram is
[1:12:04] even there and then he's mad because
[1:12:07] Jehoshaphat showed up with
[1:12:09] him right he knows he shouldn't be ping
[1:12:11] around with him that's why he got
[1:12:12] himself in that
[1:12:14] trouble and then also because because
[1:12:17] the king of Edom was there what's he
[1:12:19] doing there and Amos 3:3 says can two
[1:12:21] walk together except they be
[1:12:23] agreed obviously they can't 2
[1:12:25] Corinthians 6:14 be not unequally yolked
[1:12:27] together with unbelievers for what
[1:12:29] Fellowship hath righteousness with
[1:12:30] unrighteousness what communion hath
[1:12:32] light with Darkness brother random says
[1:12:35] it this way he said you can't associate
[1:12:36] night and day together neither can you
[1:12:39] associate belief and unbelief together
[1:12:40] listen to this he said when you find
[1:12:43] unbelief it's accompanied by
[1:12:45] hatred when you find unbelief it's
[1:12:47] accompanied by hatred if you find Faith
[1:12:50] it's accompanied by
[1:12:53] love remember that that unbelief
[1:12:56] accompanied by hatred you said those
[1:12:57] people love me unbelief is accompanied
[1:12:59] by hatred if you find faith is
[1:13:02] accompanied by love love creates faith
[1:13:05] without faith he said why you can't have
[1:13:09] love now he said then this believer
[1:13:11] Jehoshaphat willing to give respects to
[1:13:13] somebody who had a great Kingdom and
[1:13:15] probably the prestige that this young
[1:13:17] king had in his day he said he before
[1:13:19] considering God or asking God whether he
[1:13:22] should do it or not he United his forces
[1:13:24] to go go make war with the Enemy not
[1:13:27] realizing he was hooking himself up with
[1:13:29] the with as bad an enemy or worse than
[1:13:32] what the moabites would
[1:13:34] be brother brandom saw that in that day
[1:13:37] as being the the World Council of
[1:13:38] churches coming against
[1:13:40] communism hooking themselves up with the
[1:13:42] Catholic church and he said that was
[1:13:44] worse it's bad or worse than what
[1:13:46] communism
[1:13:48] was right and now what is in this day
[1:13:51] the world and the church are just
[1:13:53] married merged together
[1:13:55] right and they they've hooked themselves
[1:13:57] up with an enemy that's is bad and they
[1:14:00] fight abortion and things like that but
[1:14:01] the enemy that they're hooked up with
[1:14:02] just as bad so you got to watch who you
[1:14:06] walk with where you Fellowship because
[1:14:08] we we need to have fellowship with God
[1:14:10] most of all is that
[1:14:11] right so we can't we can't just we can't
[1:14:15] join forces you have to be in the world
[1:14:18] but you can't join forces with the
[1:14:20] world now it almost got Jehoshaphat
[1:14:23] killed from lack of water now another
[1:14:26] reason that Elisha had to get in the
[1:14:29] spirit is because he was God's chosen
[1:14:31] vessel there wasn't anybody else to do
[1:14:34] it we could put it like that he couldn't
[1:14:37] just say go to a different
[1:14:41] Prophet huh he was God's prophet and
[1:14:44] they had a need and there was a True
[1:14:47] Believer Jehoshaphat that was among that
[1:14:49] make believer an unbeliever and see if
[1:14:51] we're not careful we look at the world
[1:14:53] we see all the unbelief and the things
[1:14:54] that are going on on and we just want to
[1:14:56] withdraw oursel like Elisha and we get
[1:14:58] kind of angry in our spirit and and he
[1:15:01] said he said if it wasn't for
[1:15:03] Jehoshaphat being here I wouldn't even
[1:15:04] recognize that you're here but now
[1:15:07] because Jehoshaphat was there the
[1:15:10] prophet's attitude toward these Kings
[1:15:13] would determine if they lived or
[1:15:15] died the prophet getting in the spirit I
[1:15:18] don't think we realize how important it
[1:15:20] is
[1:15:21] today whether we get in the spirit or
[1:15:23] not is going to determine whether some
[1:15:25] people live or
[1:15:29] die whether you're in the spirit when
[1:15:31] you go to the gas station might
[1:15:32] determine someone's Eternal
[1:15:34] destination whether you're in the spirit
[1:15:36] when you come to church might determine
[1:15:38] someone's Eternal
[1:15:40] destination so it's your attitude
[1:15:42] towards Fe brother bam talks about that
[1:15:44] and standing in the Gap with himself he
[1:15:45] said these Ricky and rickettes that have
[1:15:48] so sass the words he said I've called
[1:15:49] them Ricky and Retta he said God give me
[1:15:52] to understand I shouldn't do that
[1:15:53] because that's so many of them are still
[1:15:54] his children
[1:15:55] he said they can't help because they act
[1:15:57] so much different some of these old cold
[1:15:59] formal churches who got them he said
[1:16:01] that Spirit upon them they're in in much
[1:16:03] in prison as Israel was in prison just
[1:16:05] as much as Moses went down to deliver
[1:16:07] them from slavery human beings that love
[1:16:09] Jesus Christ would serve him if they
[1:16:11] only knew what to serve him by and
[1:16:13] they're in bondage under
[1:16:14] denominationalism that tells them don't
[1:16:16] you do this and don't you do that but
[1:16:18] the call of God must come amen he said
[1:16:22] whoever wants to March toward the
[1:16:23] promised land let him March we're on our
[1:16:25] road to the promised land are you on
[1:16:26] your road today he said let them come
[1:16:29] March we're on our road to meet Christ
[1:16:30] at the end time he said and I wanted to
[1:16:32] bring this to you so that you would see
[1:16:34] and show you that the mistake a man can
[1:16:36] make it being
[1:16:38] sincere Paul tells us about the
[1:16:40] five-fold ministry in Ephesians 4 11-14
[1:16:43] and then he says in verse 15 but
[1:16:45] speaking the truth in love speaking the
[1:16:48] truth in love why is that so important
[1:16:50] because our attitude towards the people
[1:16:52] we're speaking to matters
[1:16:55] we are God's chosen vessels of Mercy to
[1:16:57] give Mercy to the age that we live in
[1:16:59] speaking the truth and love may grow up
[1:17:01] into him in all things which is the head
[1:17:03] even Christ from whom the whole body
[1:17:05] fitly joined together and compacted by
[1:17:07] that which every joint supplieth
[1:17:09] according to the effectual working in
[1:17:10] the measure of every part maketh
[1:17:12] increase of the body un the edifying of
[1:17:15] itself in
[1:17:17] love see we must get in the spirit
[1:17:20] because we are God's mercy
[1:17:21] seat on the earth we are God's mercy
[1:17:24] seat
[1:17:25] on the earth so if we are not in the
[1:17:28] spirit we can't provide that Mercy that
[1:17:30] people
[1:17:32] need what how did he get in the spirit
[1:17:34] let's look at that first of all he had
[1:17:36] to get out of the way he had to get his
[1:17:38] own feelings out of the way to help them
[1:17:41] Paul says he kept under his body and
[1:17:42] brought bring it into subjection lest by
[1:17:44] any means I preach to others I myself
[1:17:46] should be a Cast Away brother Brandon
[1:17:48] says it this way in perfect strength by
[1:17:50] Perfect weakness he said there's one
[1:17:51] thing we've got to master if we expect
[1:17:53] to fulfill God God's desire in our life
[1:17:56] that is we have to master the thought of
[1:17:58] human
[1:18:00] ability he said if we ever get to a spot
[1:18:02] where we think we can do it with our own
[1:18:04] intelligence and our own abilities we've
[1:18:05] got to master that in such a way that we
[1:18:08] can get rid of the thing and lay it
[1:18:09] aside so God can use us how do you get
[1:18:12] in the spirit get yourself out of the
[1:18:13] way uh brother brandom says once more
[1:18:16] they said brother brandham what is that
[1:18:17] gift it's a gift of knowing how to get
[1:18:19] William brandom out of the way so Jesus
[1:18:22] Christ can live through a vessel just
[1:18:24] get
[1:18:25] yourself out of the way we talked about
[1:18:28] dying to your own thoughts now another
[1:18:31] thing that Elisha had to do I'm going
[1:18:33] through this and I was just writing
[1:18:34] these things down as I'm going through
[1:18:35] but the scripture another thing he had
[1:18:37] to do was he had to recognize another
[1:18:40] man's
[1:18:41] gift this is
[1:18:43] important the Bible tells us there are
[1:18:45] diversities of gifts but the Same Spirit
[1:18:48] even the prophet had to recognize the
[1:18:50] gift of a
[1:18:52] musician to get him in the spirit
[1:18:56] huh he had to recognize that he needed
[1:18:59] another
[1:19:01] gift and and as pastors have to realize
[1:19:04] that too we need evangelists and and
[1:19:07] apostles and Prophets and and all these
[1:19:09] other things teachers we need these
[1:19:12] things and also people have to realize
[1:19:15] that you need other people you need
[1:19:17] another
[1:19:18] gift you you may not be a prophet you
[1:19:20] may not be an evangelist you may be a
[1:19:22] minstral but there is a need for you
[1:19:25] you now again there's diversities of
[1:19:29] gifts but the same spirit and brother BR
[1:19:31] says now you might not be the prophet
[1:19:32] but you could be the ministrel or you
[1:19:34] can be part of it anyhow to bring the
[1:19:37] power of
[1:19:38] God huh again he said in El Elijah and
[1:19:41] Elisha he said if you can't be the
[1:19:42] prophet be part of the minals do
[1:19:45] something to bring the spirit of the
[1:19:46] Lord
[1:19:48] down oh how our services would
[1:19:51] change if every one of us walked into
[1:19:54] the house of go and said Lord what can I
[1:19:56] do today to help the spirit of the Lord
[1:19:58] fall in this
[1:20:00] congregation what how could I help What
[1:20:02] Can I Do Lord do you want me to pray for
[1:20:03] the pastor do you want me to do you want
[1:20:05] me to sing do you want me to clap my
[1:20:07] hands do you what do you want me to do
[1:20:09] brother brand talking about that Minal
[1:20:10] he said well I don't know how to play an
[1:20:11] instrument but I got an instrument of 10
[1:20:14] strings if that's all I can do is clap
[1:20:16] let me clap the best of my ability Lord
[1:20:18] in such a way that it would bring the
[1:20:20] presence of God down I've seen it before
[1:20:23] I've seen it where God where the the
[1:20:25] meeting seemed like would be stalled it
[1:20:27] seemed like that maybe at the end of a
[1:20:29] service where things were just quiet and
[1:20:31] kind of stalled I've seen one person get
[1:20:33] in the spirit of God maybe one person
[1:20:35] clap their hands one person begin to
[1:20:37] begin to worship God tears coming down
[1:20:39] their face when they do all of a sudden
[1:20:41] it goes from one to the other I I've
[1:20:43] watched one person get up I've seen this
[1:20:46] happen many times one person will get up
[1:20:47] and come to the altar maybe they don't
[1:20:49] even really have a need but something
[1:20:51] just compels them they want to come and
[1:20:53] and they come to the Altar and all of a
[1:20:54] sudden it breaks breaks loose and many
[1:20:55] people begin to come why because that
[1:20:57] one person was a conduit to be a
[1:20:59] blessing to other people they become a
[1:21:02] Minstrel if you can't be the part the
[1:21:04] prophet be part of the minstrels do
[1:21:06] something to bring the spirit of the
[1:21:08] Lord down and brother Mar said the
[1:21:10] prophet couldn't do it
[1:21:12] himself he had to have the minstrel to
[1:21:15] help
[1:21:16] him amen you realize how important we
[1:21:20] are all of us are to the service the
[1:21:23] prophet couldn't do it himself listen to
[1:21:26] me the majority of the way a service is
[1:21:29] going to go depends much more on what
[1:21:31] happens out here than what happens up
[1:21:34] here it depends much more on what
[1:21:37] happens in the fuse than what happens
[1:21:38] over there I can prove that to you
[1:21:41] because I've been overseas and I've been
[1:21:42] to different places and everywhere you
[1:21:44] go there's a different spirit and
[1:21:46] there's places where you can walk out
[1:21:47] and preach with no notes there's times I
[1:21:50] can do that here right because it's just
[1:21:52] that atmosphere it's there but in
[1:21:54] America America in most places you can't
[1:21:55] do that you walk out there and and you
[1:21:58] you you have to push through that and
[1:22:00] push through it and push through it and
[1:22:01] push through that tiredness and that
[1:22:03] busyness to get to a place but you can
[1:22:05] go to different parts of the world they
[1:22:06] just don't have it it's not because
[1:22:07] they're much more spiritual than you are
[1:22:09] it's because they don't have as
[1:22:11] much it's much easier for them to get
[1:22:14] quiet much easier for them to have faith
[1:22:16] because it's all they got right but
[1:22:19] because of where we live and and we've
[1:22:21] heard it we've heard it over and over
[1:22:22] again but oh that God would help us to
[1:22:24] real realize where we are how much we
[1:22:26] mean to the service Lord I can make a
[1:22:28] difference today maybe if you feel the
[1:22:30] pastor struggling or singer is
[1:22:32] struggling or somebody and you just
[1:22:34] begin to worship and say Lord I'm going
[1:22:36] to press through for them I'm going to
[1:22:38] press through for them I'm not going to
[1:22:39] let them just sit by the side I'm going
[1:22:41] to press through I'm going to be a Minal
[1:22:43] to be a blessing to the
[1:22:45] prophet
[1:22:48] amen he was willing you know I thought
[1:22:51] about that Ministry I could preach a
[1:22:52] sermon just on him but that Minister was
[1:22:55] willing to be used he woke up that
[1:22:57] morning and he didn't know what he was
[1:22:58] going to do that day he's probably maybe
[1:23:01] just a part of the army just somebody
[1:23:03] who's called to Help the People March
[1:23:06] but he had a special gift to be able to
[1:23:07] play Maybe didn't think much of it but
[1:23:10] here he's he's sitting there in Camp
[1:23:12] that day and all of a sudden he gets a
[1:23:13] call the prophet needs you what does he
[1:23:15] need me for he needs you because he
[1:23:17] can't get in the spirit without
[1:23:21] you that's why I always looked at it
[1:23:23] differently you know people say well I I
[1:23:24] have to feel led what if that Minister
[1:23:25] that morning say well I just don't feel
[1:23:27] led to
[1:23:29] go believe I'll just stay home if I if I
[1:23:33] didn't preach every time I didn't feel
[1:23:34] led to preach we'd have a
[1:23:38] problem if you only feel preach when you
[1:23:40] feel led you would never but see there's
[1:23:42] things that you just have to be done and
[1:23:43] the thing is if you'll step into it God
[1:23:45] will anoint it if the gift is there you
[1:23:48] just operate that gift watch how brother
[1:23:49] Brandon would say that he said' no I
[1:23:51] don't know that he'll meet me he said
[1:23:52] but he's never failed me and every time
[1:23:55] he'd stand there and he said I'm waiting
[1:23:56] on him and all of a sudden he'd say he's
[1:23:58] here and he never failed to do that he
[1:24:01] never failed to see to see God coming
[1:24:03] down in that moment why because he was
[1:24:06] able right then to put him get himself
[1:24:08] out of the way and God always work
[1:24:11] through him and God will work through
[1:24:12] you too you got the ability to sing sing
[1:24:16] for
[1:24:16] god well I don't do a very good job I
[1:24:20] don't have much of a
[1:24:21] voice come talk to me about that
[1:24:23] sometime
[1:24:25] I got scars on my vocal cords you know
[1:24:28] and you talk to a preacher about that
[1:24:30] but there's still something in you you
[1:24:31] want to
[1:24:32] sing why not because you're you're not
[1:24:34] singing for people you're singing for
[1:24:35] the
[1:24:37] Lord and sometimes that means not
[1:24:42] singing sometimes it means not being
[1:24:44] offended if your name's not
[1:24:47] called right sometimes I can help the
[1:24:50] service by not singing maybe I shouldn't
[1:24:51] have said that
[1:24:55] are you with me now what Can I Do
[1:24:58] Lord wh what how can I bring the help
[1:25:00] the spirit of the Lord to come down on
[1:25:02] the
[1:25:06] service the third thing he had to have
[1:25:08] was music he had to get himself out of
[1:25:10] the way he had to recognize the gift of
[1:25:12] another person he had to have music
[1:25:14] brother Brown said there's nothing like
[1:25:15] music you know God heals by
[1:25:17] music said God heals by
[1:25:20] Music 1st Samuel
[1:25:22] 16:23 it came to pass said the evil
[1:25:25] spirit from God was upon Saul and David
[1:25:28] took a harp and played with his hand so
[1:25:29] Saul was refreshed and was well and the
[1:25:32] evil spirit departed from him where it
[1:25:34] says Saul was refreshed it literally
[1:25:35] means he was
[1:25:37] revived Saul got in Revival because
[1:25:41] David playing the
[1:25:43] harp he was revived by music brother
[1:25:46] brand said it this way he said Jess he
[1:25:48] got a son back there yeah he's a Divine
[1:25:49] healer sure he was he healed by music he
[1:25:52] said that's what he did he had a gift of
[1:25:53] casting out evil Spirits the Holy Ghost
[1:25:55] hadn't come in those days so he cast him
[1:25:57] out by music playing the words of the
[1:25:59] Lord he talked about the Lord is my
[1:26:01] shepherd I shall not want and he talks
[1:26:02] about that Psalm and it Disturbed the
[1:26:04] evil spirit so much that they left
[1:26:07] Saul he said shame on you people that
[1:26:09] don't believe in string music he said no
[1:26:12] wonder evil spirits never like it they
[1:26:14] have to get away David cast out Devils
[1:26:16] by playing on his stringed instrument he
[1:26:19] said that's what the scripture says
[1:26:20] that's right and when David would begin
[1:26:21] to play the evil spirit would leave Saul
[1:26:27] I think about just the
[1:26:29] music and we think well it's the music
[1:26:31] it's the singing but it's not
[1:26:33] necessarily the words that produce the
[1:26:35] atmosphere that helps but the music
[1:26:38] itself produces an atmosphere don't let
[1:26:41] anybody ever tell you music is aoral
[1:26:43] it's not modern church is bought into
[1:26:45] that but music is not aoral music can be
[1:26:48] good or bad or it can be
[1:26:51] indifferent right there can be music
[1:26:53] that's neither good or bad there can be
[1:26:54] music that's bad there can be music
[1:26:55] that's good and there's a difference in
[1:26:57] worldly music and church
[1:26:59] music and and so but there's a
[1:27:01] difference in when you need the spirit
[1:27:03] of the Lord to come down you have to
[1:27:05] sing something that the spirit of the
[1:27:07] Lord is is pleased with and we could say
[1:27:09] it more like this there's times you have
[1:27:11] to sing or play something or hear
[1:27:13] something or listen to something that
[1:27:14] will get your spirit quiet not every
[1:27:17] type of music will do that and there's
[1:27:20] other times you need to be that feel
[1:27:21] that Revival you may need to hear a fast
[1:27:23] song
[1:27:25] right you may need to that there's
[1:27:27] something about that music that gets you
[1:27:28] in a certain
[1:27:30] atmosphere a person can change I've
[1:27:32] watched this over the years at the end
[1:27:34] of a service you can completely change
[1:27:36] the atmosphere of the service at the End
[1:27:38] by changing the
[1:27:39] music ever seen that people could be
[1:27:41] down here praying and and everything and
[1:27:43] all you have to do is start playing fast
[1:27:44] music and all of a sudden people get up
[1:27:46] and and people start rejoicing and
[1:27:48] there's a different
[1:27:49] atmosphere why because there there
[1:27:51] something that it does to our nature to
[1:27:53] our spirit so music in itself means
[1:27:56] something and brother brand talked about
[1:27:58] it casting out evil spirits so it's
[1:28:00] important what we listen to and it's
[1:28:03] important what we have here in the
[1:28:04] church that it would be Godly music and
[1:28:07] but we do believe in music and and this
[1:28:10] is what I want to get to is that you you
[1:28:12] talk about you say well what's good and
[1:28:14] what's
[1:28:15] bad What atmosphere does it
[1:28:19] bring right and that's the way I've
[1:28:21] always looked at it because you get
[1:28:22] started looking say well what what is
[1:28:24] this one what kind of person was he and
[1:28:27] what kind of person was she when they
[1:28:28] started in in their music and things
[1:28:30] like that who wrote it and that may give
[1:28:32] you a clue but when you get down to
[1:28:34] where who wrote it and all of that you
[1:28:36] may find out some of your favorite songs
[1:28:37] weren't that
[1:28:41] great so you got to be careful with that
[1:28:44] but remember what atmosphere does it
[1:28:46] brings does the Holy Spirit like
[1:28:49] it you put it like that now the Holy
[1:28:52] Spirit doesn't like rock and roll we
[1:28:53] know that what was the problem with
[1:28:55] Elvis
[1:28:55] Presley it wasn't hit the words of the
[1:28:58] songs it was the
[1:29:01] music the words didn't
[1:29:03] help if you ain't nothing but a hound
[1:29:06] dog but they're much more innocuous than
[1:29:10] anything that we would have today in the
[1:29:13] you know in the worldly music but it's
[1:29:14] the music itself and so music matters
[1:29:18] but I want to look at the positive side
[1:29:19] of it this morning he said I was talking
[1:29:20] to a man not long ago that didn't
[1:29:21] believe in music in the church he was
[1:29:22] holding a fuss with me about it oh the
[1:29:24] music belongs to the world I said the
[1:29:26] spirit of God didn't come on that stewed
[1:29:27] up Prophet until he got the minstrel out
[1:29:30] and be to play a good oldfashioned Holy
[1:29:31] Ghost
[1:29:32] song Amen he said and the spirit of God
[1:29:35] come down on the prophet that's right
[1:29:36] God doesn't change and if God Like Music
[1:29:38] in that day God likes music today and he
[1:29:41] began to play the song I don't know what
[1:29:42] they played in them days he said but I
[1:29:44] imagine a good old song like there's
[1:29:45] going to be a meeting in the air and
[1:29:48] brother Bram changes this song by the
[1:29:49] way so that he's not he just throwing a
[1:29:52] song out there is what I think he's
[1:29:53] doing because because he says only
[1:29:54] believe in one place another place he
[1:29:56] said the oldtime religion those are very
[1:29:59] different songs but he said a good old
[1:30:01] song like there's going to be a meeting
[1:30:03] in the air he said something like that
[1:30:04] some of those good oldfashioned Holy
[1:30:05] Ghost songs and the spirit of God come
[1:30:07] on the prophet he said I tell you
[1:30:10] brother when we get all the formal
[1:30:11] shackles shook down and the spirit of
[1:30:14] God and the songs again get back to an
[1:30:16] old place where we can have the spirit
[1:30:17] of God moving in the place he said then
[1:30:19] the prophet can see a vision then the
[1:30:21] powers of God comes on the church we
[1:30:24] believe that today he said you know
[1:30:25] singing gets courage he said you know
[1:30:27] that don't you he said the soldiers when
[1:30:28] they're going to battle he said you know
[1:30:30] what they do they play music and sing
[1:30:32] and things to give them courage and when
[1:30:34] we're going to battle we sing and it
[1:30:36] gives us courage to go
[1:30:38] on Amen I often think about that when
[1:30:41] brother Brown sees the preview of the
[1:30:42] bride and he sees her going marching to
[1:30:44] Onward Christian Soldiers Onward
[1:30:47] Christian Soldiers oh my what better
[1:30:49] thing could there be than to march to
[1:30:51] heaven on that song now
[1:30:55] we find an example of this in second
[1:30:57] chronic Chronicles 20 I thought I would
[1:30:58] already be done this morning but thank
[1:31:00] you for staying with me second
[1:31:01] chronicles 20 and verse 20 says they
[1:31:04] Rose early in the morning and went forth
[1:31:05] Into the Wilderness of tcoa as they went
[1:31:08] forth Jehoshaphat stood and said hear me
[1:31:09] oh Judah the inhabitants of Jerusalem
[1:31:11] believe in the Lord your God so shall
[1:31:13] you be established believe his Prophet
[1:31:15] so shall you prosper now they had come
[1:31:18] against a Time much like Jehoshaphat was
[1:31:20] in they were in a hard time it it was a
[1:31:23] it was was a problem and this is Josh
[1:31:25] had again but he knew that God would
[1:31:27] move for him but now he he's saying if
[1:31:30] you believe then you'll Prosper when he
[1:31:33] consulted the people notice what he did
[1:31:35] did he appointed singers unto the
[1:31:37] Lord now it says when he consulted with
[1:31:39] the people have often wondered what he
[1:31:41] talked to them about they probably tried
[1:31:43] to find out who would
[1:31:45] sing and who could
[1:31:47] sing he consulted with the people so
[1:31:49] there's nothing wrong with that go to
[1:31:51] the people find out who can sing and
[1:31:54] sometimes you might get asked to sing
[1:31:55] and I think that's that'd be a blessing
[1:31:56] man if I was ever asked to sing I always
[1:31:58] had to write it in
[1:32:00] and have a affertive super secret
[1:32:03] campaign to get somebody
[1:32:07] to not they brother so and so requested
[1:32:11] him and sit back there I didn't request
[1:32:13] it I never did that but he he consulted
[1:32:17] the people and he pointed singers unto
[1:32:18] the Lord and they should praise the
[1:32:19] beauty of Holiness as they went out
[1:32:21] before the Army and to say praise the
[1:32:22] Lord for his mercy endureth for
[1:32:24] forever when they begin to sing and to
[1:32:27] praise the Lord set ambushments against
[1:32:29] the children of amm and Moab and mount
[1:32:31] seir which were come against Judah and
[1:32:32] they were
[1:32:34] smitten and a prophet Prophet had
[1:32:37] prophesied in the midst of the people
[1:32:39] that day and said this is not your
[1:32:40] battle this is God's battle you've all
[1:32:42] heard it preached on before but it's
[1:32:45] it's when they begin to sing what was it
[1:32:46] the atmosphere changed and all of a
[1:32:49] sudden God be to work why they'd gotten
[1:32:51] in the spirit they begin to sing and to
[1:32:53] praise and and God begin to set ambushes
[1:32:55] against the children of am and Moab and
[1:32:57] mount Seer listen if you get in the
[1:32:59] spirit today if you just really begin to
[1:33:01] sing and to praise and worship God and
[1:33:03] let things go a little bit say Lord I'm
[1:33:04] not going to worry about everything
[1:33:06] that's going on I'm going to really just
[1:33:07] begin to Worship You what'll happen
[1:33:09] you'll find yourself in the spirit and
[1:33:11] you'll find the problems that you had
[1:33:13] being ambushed by
[1:33:15] God Amen the Bible say when they got
[1:33:18] down to the battlefield all they found
[1:33:19] was dead
[1:33:21] bodies and stuff to pick up loot
[1:33:26] all they found was dead bodies in gold
[1:33:28] and silver and diamonds all around
[1:33:29] because that's what God does he'll turn
[1:33:32] your problem into a into a promise into
[1:33:34] a blessing why why does he do it because
[1:33:36] you got out of the
[1:33:38] way they begin to sing in praise and the
[1:33:41] Holy Spirit come down now what were the
[1:33:43] results of Elisha getting in his Spirit
[1:33:46] he had a
[1:33:47] vision he could
[1:33:49] see and the results of getting in the
[1:33:52] spirit if you get in the spirit of
[1:33:53] Revival you can see the vision of
[1:33:55] Revival as we've said the vision of a
[1:33:58] possibility and he said thus sayth the
[1:34:00] Lord make this Valley full of
[1:34:04] ditches thus sayith the Lord You shall
[1:34:06] not see wind neither shall you see rain
[1:34:08] other words you won't see it coming or
[1:34:09] how it comes yet that Valley should be
[1:34:12] filled with water that you may drink
[1:34:14] both ye and your cattle and your
[1:34:16] beast and Elisha told Jehoshaphat and
[1:34:18] them dig this place full of ditches
[1:34:20] listen to this he said the deeper you
[1:34:22] dig the the more room you're going to
[1:34:24] have for
[1:34:26] water God help us
[1:34:28] today the deeper you dig the more room
[1:34:31] you're going to have for water I think
[1:34:33] we got our shovels out but we didn't dig
[1:34:35] very
[1:34:37] deep I used to catch catfish bunch of
[1:34:40] catfish and skin them on the tree and
[1:34:42] I'd leave the I shouldn't probably tell
[1:34:45] this what I've done to my kids but I I'd
[1:34:47] leave the remains of the catfish and my
[1:34:49] kid Peter had to bury them cuz we lived
[1:34:52] in town and you couldn't just leave them
[1:34:53] out to throw them somewhere so I left
[1:34:56] him out in the backyard and Peter had to
[1:34:57] bury them and the first couple times he
[1:34:59] did that it
[1:35:01] stunk he didn't bury them deep
[1:35:03] enough right the cats go out there and
[1:35:05] the dogs and scratch up and he just put
[1:35:07] a little bit of dirt over his top and
[1:35:08] said Son you got a
[1:35:10] dick if you're going to bury catfish
[1:35:13] where you can't smell it anymore you got
[1:35:14] a dick if you're going to have a a big
[1:35:16] enough hole a big enough ditch to have
[1:35:18] some water you've got to dig and he
[1:35:21] saids the deeper that you dig the more
[1:35:23] room you're going to have for
[1:35:25] water amen he said in the more of our
[1:35:28] own selves what are you digging out by
[1:35:30] the same you're digging out
[1:35:32] yourself amen the more of our own selves
[1:35:34] of our own of the own rubbish of our own
[1:35:36] abilities that we can throw out of us
[1:35:38] you say I'm so good at doing this I'm so
[1:35:40] wonderful no throw that out dig that out
[1:35:43] dig out your own abilities the more of
[1:35:45] our own abilities of our own rubbish of
[1:35:47] our own abilities we can throw out of us
[1:35:48] the more room there will be to be filled
[1:35:50] by the spirit of God long as we can do
[1:35:52] that he says
[1:35:54] that's what we need
[1:35:55] dig dig dig it out you want Revival we
[1:35:58] want Revival we preached about it for
[1:36:00] weeks and weeks now let's dig those
[1:36:01] disches let's dig said well I dug a
[1:36:03] little bit dig them deeper the deeper
[1:36:06] you dig the more water you'll
[1:36:08] have amen what did the prophet see in
[1:36:11] the vision brother B said what did he
[1:36:12] see he saw a vision of that spiritual
[1:36:14] rock that Moses had already smitten and
[1:36:16] been speaking to he had just spoke to
[1:36:18] that rock and it was ready to pour forth
[1:36:20] the water when ditches was made for it
[1:36:22] to run in listen our job is not to bring
[1:36:25] the water that's not what we can't do
[1:36:26] that but our job is to get the
[1:36:28] atmosphere right to get in the spirit
[1:36:30] and dig the ditches get in the spirit
[1:36:32] and dig out the ditches get in the
[1:36:34] spirit and get rid of our own cells of
[1:36:36] our own rubbish of our own abilities and
[1:36:38] let the water
[1:36:39] flow amen what do they have when they
[1:36:42] got done they had Victory Second Kings
[1:36:44] 3:21 I'm closing in just a moment when
[1:36:47] all the moabites heard the kings were
[1:36:48] come up to fight against them they
[1:36:50] gathered all that were able to put on
[1:36:51] Armor and upward and stood in the Border
[1:36:53] they rose up early in the morning and
[1:36:54] the sun Shone upon the water and the
[1:36:56] moabites saw the water on the other side
[1:36:58] as red as blood they said this is blood
[1:37:01] the kings are surely slain they have
[1:37:03] smitten one another now therefore Moab
[1:37:05] to the spoil can you imagine the
[1:37:07] moabites each one of them threw their
[1:37:09] weapons down grabbed a wheelbarrow head
[1:37:11] down to the camp of Israel all they're
[1:37:13] already dead that's what the devil
[1:37:15] thinks about you today it's what the
[1:37:17] devil thinks about the bride today oh
[1:37:19] they're already dead look at them they
[1:37:20] can't have Revival they can't worship
[1:37:22] God they can't do nothing but sit like a
[1:37:23] up on a pickle look at them we're going
[1:37:24] to go down there I see blood but they
[1:37:26] didn't realize the blood was a sign that
[1:37:28] God had already blessed them the blood
[1:37:30] was a sign not not that they' been they
[1:37:32] died but they God had already shed the
[1:37:34] blood for them oh my don't you see
[1:37:36] that's a sign today the people see the
[1:37:38] weakness but we see the strength of God
[1:37:41] they went down there with their
[1:37:42] wheelbarrows and the children of Israel
[1:37:43] rose up against them and began to Smite
[1:37:45] them and they they they got rid of Moab
[1:37:48] like never before they went forward
[1:37:49] spining the moabites why because they
[1:37:52] were willing to get in the spirit and
