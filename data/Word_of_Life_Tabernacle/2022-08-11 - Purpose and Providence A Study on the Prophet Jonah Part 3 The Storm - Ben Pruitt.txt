got a need maybe on your heart you'd like to make known by way of uplifted hand i'm sure god sees all of those needs tonight and knows what's on your heart heavily father we thank you for the privilege that we have of coming into your house once again what a great responsibility it is to stand before the purchase of your blood lord and to speak something that would help them through their week and through their day lord help them to be better christians and more like you and myself as well lord i i pray lord that you'd help me to say only those things that you'd want me to say lord i pray for every need that was represented by an uplift to the hand i know that you know lord and you're able to reach down and meet those needs tonight you're a god whose arm is not short but you're able to meet all of our needs and so we believe that today and we trust you lord that you're going to do it we ask it in the name of jesus the precious name of our lord jesus christ amen amen amen good to be here on a wednesday night and to be serving the lord we're going to read from jonah chapter 1 verses 3 and 4 just those two verses and while you're turning there it's uh it's a good day to be in the house of the lord brother theo is theo here tonight where is he asleep yet it's his birthday theo it's your birthday happy birthday i uh i love these kids i the older i get the more i hope to be a grandfather you know it's hard being a dad and they say if you if you raise your kids right you'll get to spoil your grandkids if you spoil your kids you have to raise your grandkids so uh we want to raise our kids right so we get to spoil the grandkids we appreciate all of these these children amen young people amen not the necessarily a church of tomorrow but a church of today they're a big part of what we do here it's good to have all of you with us tonight jonah chapter 1 and verse 3 if you haven't kept up with the services about jonah you can go back to the previous two or three wednesday nights and you'll find the other things that we've said so far and we'll maybe continue if the lord would allow us to do that it says but jonah rose up to flee unto tarshish from the presence of the lord and went down to joppa and he found a ship going to tarshish so he paid the fare thereof and went down into it to go with them unto tarshish from the presence of the lord but the lord had other ideas i love that but the lord is what paul says in the new testament but god rich in mercy but the lord had other ideas the lord sent out a great wind into the sea and there was a mighty tempest in the sea so that the ship was like to be broken i pray the lord would add his blessing to the word you may be seated this evening i want to speak to you about that storm that jonah went through jonah's going to tarshish it's as far as you can go i think i put a map on the slides i don't know if you can read it but if you go to this side of the screen nineveh is all the way almost on this side of the screen jonah is coming from joppa the port city of joppa which is in israel and all the way on the other side that's spain over there that's what we would know it as today it was the iberian peninsula that somewhere around there is where tarshish was and tarshish was a place where the great trading ships of the day would bring gold and silver it was a three-year round-trip journey jonah wasn't just going to another town he was going as far as he could go to get away from god and he gets a little little ways out in the sea and he found out god had other plans amen we know we don't get far because he just gets into the boat and lays down to rest and sometime during the night a storm broke out oh my how many times have we tried to run from god and we got a little bit away from him and a storm broke out something happened to get our attention and to bring us back where we're supposed to be so if you look at at that map and then go to first kings chapter 10 and verse 22 uh solomon the great king solomon had a had at sea a navy of tarshish with the navy of hiram that was the king of lebanon once in three years came the navy of tarshish bringing gold and silver ivory and apes and peacocks and they would they would go across the ocean there the great ships the largest most stable ships in the world and verse 27 and the king made silver to be in jerusalem as stones that's that's how much they could hold and how much they would bring that he actually made silver to be in jerusalem and stones and cedars made he to be as the sycamore trees that are in the veil for abundance the bible says even gold was almost worthless during solomon's reign because he made almost everything out of it he was very very wealthy it's the type of the millennium right that we're going to and so uh so here he brought all this stuff from tarshish so there was a great trade that was going on even in jonah's day he would have known about that now so again he wasn't just going away he was going on the biggest strongest ship possible going to tarshish to go to a place where he thought god couldn't force him to go to nineveh he's going the opposite direction and he didn't understand and i don't think we understand sometimes when we run away from god when we go in the opposite direction we're playing right into the hand of god yes sir you think about your children how sometimes they try to run from church and and they try to run for don't worry god's got his hand on their lives we we have a promised church that they're going to come back if they were raised in the fear and admonition of the lord if you raise them right he said in the end when they're old they won't depart from it and so we have a promise he's got his hand on him he's in charge of the water that they're sailing on he's in charge of the people at their job he's in charge of the country that they live in he's in charge of the places that they go and at the right time he's going to stir things up until they begin to come back to god and that's the exact place where joe where jonah found himself jonah was going to make it impossible for jehovah to force him to go to nineveh and he didn't understand he was right where god wanted him to be the bible tells us that god is in charge of the waters even psalms 48-7 he said thou breakest the ships of tarshish with an east wind so it's even in prophecy jonah would have sung that in the temple he would have known that verse he would have been acquainted with the psalms of david how that the shifts of tarsus were broken by the wind of god you should have known that you can't outrun god he would have sung psalms 139 and 7 where david said whither shall i go from thy spirit or whether shall i flee from my presence if i ascend up in heaven you're there if i make my bed in hell behold thou art there oh my oh can we think of an omnipotent god tonight we think of an omnipresent god he said if i make my bed in hell thou art there if i take the wings of the morning and dwell in the outermost parts of the sea see jonah should have known better he should have known god if he wanted him to go to nineveh he was going to go to nineveh amen he said even there shall thy hand lead me and thy right hand shall hold me if i say surely the darkness shall cover me even the night shall be light about me oh there's nothing we can hide from him church we might as well surrender to his will we might as well go along with what he wants us to do we might as well believe his word can you say amen to that tonight we might as well just believe him because there's nothing we can do to alter his great plan amen that's why we shouldn't worry so much sometimes we try to micromanage everything to the point of we all we're doing is creating confusion god knows what he's doing he don't need us micromanaging our tomorrows he knows what tomorrow holds and jesus said it's sin to worry to be anxious about tomorrow sufficient to the day is the evil thereof amen it's not something we brother brown taught us worry is sin right because you you try to look forward and and even james said he said you rich man you say tomorrow we'll go do such and such he said you don't know that you'll live till tomorrow because life is just a vapor it's like a mist in the in the wind and it just goes it appears for a while it goes away it's like grass that withers and that that shouldn't be a horrible thought to us but a wonderful thought that god who placed me here and kept me all of this time is able you believe he's able tonight church he's able to continue to keep me all the way until the end of my life hey man i feel good tonight do you love the lord hey man you believe he's able to keep you hallelujah so he said john you know jonah knew all of this he said the darkness and the light are both alike to thee it was blinded by his bitterness so he ran from the presence of god but god knew that he would god called him for a purpose jonah 1 4 again says but the lord sent out a great wind into the sea there was a mighty tempest in the sea so that the ship was like to be broken they thought that they were lost you see it's many times not in the stillness of life but in the storms of life that jehovah shows its power that he manifest himself to us in psalms 107 and 23 david speaks of the of seafaring men and how they would cross the sea and get in trouble in the storms he said they that go down to the sea and ships that do business in great waters they these see the works of the lord and his wonders in the deep for he commandeth and raiseth the stormy wind which lifteth up the waves thereof you know if you want to feel small be on the ocean when the waves are coming in when a storm comes up i don't even like to be near the ocean when a storm comes up i'm being honest with you i've been down on the on the gulf coast when a storm would come in near mobile alabama and when the storm come in i didn't even want to be anywhere near the coast i was anxious and and worried even being in a in a building close to it let me honest with you why because the sea was so powerful but it's it's an expression david says of god's power that they see the works of the lord because here's these mighty waves crashing down on them he says he commandeth and raiseth the stormy wind which lifteth up the waves thereof they mount up to the heaven they go down again to the depths their soul is melted because of trouble i don't think he's just talking about sailors here but we're all sailing across live sea and sometimes we are up and sometimes we're down and sometimes it feels like we're we're a run with in the wind and and the ship is starting to break up and our souls melt because of trouble but he's even in charge during that moment yes during those times of our lives so he said they their soul is melted they reel to and fro and stagger like a drunken man and are at their wit's end yes you know what that means it means they couldn't think of anything to do that would help their situation their minds could not comprehend they were skilled sailors but they could not comprehend anything that would help their situation but let me tell you tonight but the bill when you get to a place where the doctors can't think of anything that would help you when you get to a place where you can't think of anything that would help you and everything has failed remember he's still in the boat he's still in the ship he's still in command of the storm he's still with you during that moment he's the same yesterday today and forever trust god yes because he's there with you they're at their wit's end and and they don't know what to do he said then they cry unto the lord in their trouble and he bringeth them out of their distresses oh if you've been through very much in life if you've lived very long and been a christian you know that this is true you know god lifts you up out of your distresses you make it the storm a calm so that the waves thereof are still then are they glad because they be quiet so he bringeth them unto their desired haven oh my how many times could our testimony repeat that in our lives i think of the time when jesus calmed the storm what was he doing remember david said he makes the storm a calm they knew that jehovah was in charge of the waves jehovah was in charge of the storm so when a little man who was tired a man who was asleep in the boat when they woke him up and he got up and put his foot on the bow of the boat and he said peace be still and the waves still they said that's god the believer said that's god he proved he was more than a man he proved he was god oh i i think we ought to we ought to understand who he is tonight who's with us you know he's god if he's god he's able to to reach into your situation to take care of it you're trying to solve things that don't even need solved yet you're looking down the road and and trying to figure out a life that's coming i know i've been there i've done that but the older i get the more i trust because the more i realize he's been so good to me to let me be where i'm at today i mean i don't know what tomorrow holds but i know he holds it i know he's using the storm to show his glory so in in nahum one and three which interestingly is the prophet name is the prophet of judgment to nineveh that jonah thought he would be but nam is the one who actually preaches judgment to nineveh years later he said the lord is so to anger and great in power will not at all acquit the wicked he said the lord has his way in the whirlwind and in the storm do you believe that tonight he has his way in the whirlwind and in the storm do you know who you're serving do you know what deity is tonight you know what it means to say that god has these things in his control i i watched today there was a man and i saw it when it when it happened back in december you may remember there was some tornadoes that came into kentucky and there was a man there i think his name was jordan baez or something like that and bay's i believe his name was and he was there in a in his house in kentucky was blown away and his sister was recording the next morning she walked in on him all that was left was the piano for whatever reason the piano was left there and he sits there and he plays a song and there was a lot of songs maybe that he could have chosen but he later said that this had been on his heart for days and it was jesus jesus there's something about that name there's a lot of songs about storms that you could sing but it was jesus there's something about that name because he said kings and kingdoms will all pass away amen but there's something about your name oh my that's so that's where we ought to live church that's the revelation that we ought to have we ought to be able to sit in the middle of the storm in the middle of the ruins of what it looks like the the storm that's going to destroy us it's going to take away everything sit in the middle of that and say jesus there's something about your name i know you're in control of everything i know you've got this i know you're the same yesterday today and forever i know you've helped me before i know you'll help me again right amen brother branham put it this way he said don't be scared god is driving the winds do we believe that tonight god is driving the ark he has all things provided he said why noah wouldn't have had any victories if there wouldn't have been any storms and trials he said if we're just put through a little safe tunnel to run through there's no joy yes you ever thought about this he said if we're put through a little safe tunnel to run through there's no joy the storms of life is what makes us have the joy right amen the story said what did i do to deserve my life do you want joy in your life it's the storms of life it's what makes us have joy we would never know what daylight was unless we had some dark we'd never know what a hilltop was unless we had a mountain we'd never know what good health was since we had some sickness you'd never know how to enjoy salvation unless you were once a sinner i think that's the problem with some people they don't enjoy their salvation because they don't know they've ever been a sinner but if you knew you were a sinner and you can enjoy your salvation every once in a while your hand will raise and tears will go down your face and you'll make some noise in church why you were once a sinner you know what it's like yes sir you can enjoy salvation hey man you know you weren't always good are you with me tonight god has made all things the law of contrast but levi that's why every time you go to do something good satan will come up against it every time all through your life every moment of your life when you try to do something good get ready for it satan's always going to come against it and we've talked about that lately when i would do good evil is present but just remember that just means you're doing good amen he said he doesn't he loves you that's why he makes all things the law of contrast he wants you to have joy he loves you he said see how we can rest upon his word then no matter how hard the storm blows oh it's just a simple thought tonight but i want you to un to get this he said what's contrary to it rest solemnly upon the word god said it who has seen the other side of the storm yes see god knew what the storm would do to the ship and what the sailors would do to jonah and what the hey man what the fish would do when he was dropped into the ocean jonah didn't know any of that right but god knew god knew what jonah would do and how he would go and preach in nineveh and how the people would repent and how they how that jonah would sit there and have bitterness in his heart and we'll get into all that if the lord is willing but god knew all of that ahead of time he knew what the storm looked like on the other side yes sir that's right and so he said rest on him rest solemnly upon the word god said it who has seen the other side of the storm if you're sick anchor your soul in the haven of rest if you're perplexed and distressed remember he said i'll be with you always even to the end of the world and he said all things someone say all things all things no exceptions work together for good to them that love the lord he said so just stay right there and when the sea is blowing and storming he said i guess maybe some of you has never been privileged to see a ship anchored he said i've rode them when they throw out a sea anchor like that until the little craft couldn't even go over the top of the wave it would go through the wave but as long as the anchor held that's all that makes any difference oh how many have your anchor cast today your anchors cast you're not going to pull up the anchor why the anchor holds to the storm well it might seem like having the anchor down is going to make you going to make you wreck but actually the anchor is what saves you he said as long as the anchor held that's all that makes any difference whether we go over it under it around it or through it it doesn't matter the anchor holes he said that's the way when storms of life begin to shake us we may have to go through we may have to go over under around but just let the anchor hold within the veil let the anchor hold within the veil to the unseen and brother madam talks about how the anchor holds someplace where you can't see it you can't see what it's anchored to [Applause] oh god if we could just realize that they say well i don't want to throw the anchor out because i can't see you know the anchor holds to something you can't see but the rocket's holding on it's a predestined rock it was predestined to be there by god himself it is the word of god he is what holds our anchor amen he is the anchor itself he said just let the anchor hold within the veil to the unseen we don't know just exactly where it's at but it's a holding and brother branham tells a story about the boy with a kite you've heard the story he said was that the kind was the stormy day he said you couldn't see the sky and the kite was so high that you couldn't see the kite and the boy's got the the kite and he's holding it like this and and a man walks by and he said son he said do you even know you have a kite on there he said how do you pray how can you prove it he said i can feel it tug that's the way it is with us and god sometimes when the storms of life obscure our vision of christ and we begin to not be able to see we can't prove that he's there we can't prove scientifically that our life is being guarded by the holy spirit but yet he's there and we know he's there because we feel the tug on wednesday night we feel the tug on sunday morning well i don't want to ever let go i don't want to ever let go and not be able to feel the tug of his of his hand i want to have a hold of something that i can feel i know it's not all about feelings but i want to know that he's tugging on the other side hey man he said he could feel the tug here there's a famous quote i know a lot of people use it but i just had to put it here he said now the stabilizers have been put on the ship great fearful waves are out here before us but we know just beyond that wave yonder we're nearing the shore hallelujah we're nearing the shore just stay stable just stay in the word stay with god no matter how you feel with anything else stay right with the word he said let it stay stable when you see all these great big old clouds around us and storms coming and atomic bombs and everything else they're talking about but our stabilizer is right straight in the word yes god said it would be here we'll crest every one of them what a positive quote and i know there's people who use this the same quote and brother random talks about the boy that didn't feel the joy that he used to he said well there's no revival anywhere and brother brown said if you're spiritual you'll understand what i'm talking about and he goes on to read this quote people use that to to bring the people down i i think this is a positive thing we know even when we don't feel any joy there's still joy there even when we don't have any any great signs and wonders yet we know and yet we know we're promised those things so we believe for those things but we don't have to have them to believe are you with me tonight if i never felt his presence again i still believe he's there i never knew i still believe but i'm so glad he lets us feel the tug every now and then amen he said our stabilizer is right straight in the word god said it would be here we'll crest every one of them see how positive that is he said yeah we'll go right over the top of them yes indeed they can't sink us they can't drown us you put us in the grave we'll come out again that's just all there is to it there ain't no way in the world to keep it down there we'll crest every one of them because our great chief captain is calling at the other side whatever it might be let it come what may what will doesn't make any difference we're anchored right there in jesus if i live i'll live to the glory of god if i die i could die to the glory of god see we need to recognize this tonight i know some of us some of you are getting older and i feel for you although i've never been there myself so i can't really know but i'm beginning to know as you get into middle age you begin to feel just a glimpse of old age and then you know what it's in its reality what it's like some of you but brother branham taught us that we don't worry about that even during that time because it doesn't make any difference we're anchored in christ not in the condition of our body and if we live we live to the glory of god if we die we die to the glory of god paul said for me it's far better if i go he said but nevertheless i want the will of the lord to be done right he said for you it's better that i stay here but for me it's better that i go so for me to live is christ to die is gain yes amen i'm actually better off if i go home how can the devil then ever defeat a christian because he can't kill him he can't do anything to him the christian knows just death is just a it's just a room where you take photographs and it's a dark room i don't know if we would even understand what that is today but in the olden times you took your pictures up and you took them up to a place to have them developed and and two or three weeks later you'd go up and pick them up some of you remember doing that you realize these kids will never have to go through that when i was a kid when you took they took pictures at your birthday i never knew if the cameras were they may have been the same cameras at every birthday party it was them disposable cameras you remember they still have those i think in some places but but those disposable cameras you never knew if the pictures were any good you sure didn't get to post them the next day somebody had to remember to take the disposable camera up that's why there's no pictures of me anywhere as a child because they just took the i think there's two or three that exist to me is it because back then we just didn't do stuff like that but we didn't have thousands of pictures nothing wrong with it but we we took that picture and took it to the dark room if you were lucky enough to remember it if it was important enough you took it to the dark room and when it went through the dark room it had to go through that dark room so it could be developed from the negative to the positive brother brandon said that's what death is it's just a dark room that we're going through every one of us have to go through it he said it's just a he said he said death he said it's a like a carriage with horses hitched to it that carries us to the other side it's a dark room that develops the true image that god wanted this is not the end this is just the beginning yes this is just the testing time if i die i die to the glory of god it ought to keep us positive even i know as our bodies heard and as your body is hurting as you get older but it ought to have a positivity about it i know who i am i know and whom i have believe it i know i'm persuaded he's able to keep me to that day right hey man what a when we see that and some of you and i've seen that in many of you it gives us courage as younger people to keep going on keep pressing on don't get depressed and cranky sometimes we tend to don't do that but the brandon said god don't crown me as a as a crabby old man but let me be somebody that's sweet and godly and that can that can love people until i go to the other side god help us to do that tonight i didn't mean to preach at the old people that's the most faithful people we got i do that but joel i'm in trouble aren't you glad for old people amen i'm glad you're here but you got an anchor you got an anchor if i die i died of the glory of god he said it's just to the glory of god is what i want to do when that's all over i don't want to stay any longer he said i want to go to my reward that he bought for me not what i earned but what he bought for me what he give to me by his grace amen what is that stability in the midst of the storm jonah didn't understand it like he should but he was going to understand it amen he said we must be stable in this hour but the random talks about wandering sons of god he said how the wondering sons of god wandering out there in the world some of them this denomination from denomination to denomination like wandering stars never stable like a leaf on the water in the autumn we used to see it he said back in the east the leaves would blow down on it every little wind would blow it from this side to that side if you've ever been fishing in the fall and there's a leaf on the water it'll just blow around everywhere he said but god wants us to be stable anchored in jesus the storms of life all brave anchored in jesus i fear no winds are waves see whatever it is many of you and watch this he said many of you remember the inch cape bell the inch cape bell he said when he was in school a boy and girl in school i think i've used this before but i had to go remind myself of it so i'm sure you don't remember it because i had to go and remind myself what the inch cape bell was and i didn't learn this in school because we're getting farther and farther away from the classics brother joel will tell you that i'm a lover of classic poems and my kids will tell you that as well because if you ever get a chance i'll quote them badly to you i i'll butcher them and everything else but i love them i just can't remember them but i love robert frost and and especially henry wadsworth longfellow i love longfellow and and the different english poets and american poets and i get off on that we'll just go all night but brother branham loved poetry and so he's referencing a poem that tells a story it's the inch cape lighthouse if you'll uh pull up that uh that that's the called the inch cape bell the inch cape bell was a bell that uh an abbot that lived off the coast of scotland there was ship after ship they'd come up when the tide was high to the coast of scotland and they'd wreck this uh this particular place actually wrecked over a hundred ships a hundred ships that wrecked on this particular place because the wind was whenever would storm the winds would blow them in and they couldn't see that they needed to drop an anchor they just kept going hoping they they were close to the shore but they couldn't see that they needed to drop an anchor because the water covered the rocks but just barely so the abbott went out and he took a bell and he tied it to a boy and he and that rested on the water and he took the bell and he put it out there and when they heard the bell they knew to get away or they knew to drop the anchor oh my god always gives a warning before judgment and so that bell was instrumental uh in in keeping ships from wrecking on the rocks and so the position of the rock of the reef was such that uh eventually they constructed a lighthouse i think i've got a picture of that as well as an actual picture of the lighthouse there on that rock you can see you can't see the rocks but they're under the water and so when the tide is up uh the lighthouse has to make sure that it keeps uh it keeps shining it's actually the oldest lighthouse uh in the ocean like that it's 200 years old the oldest one that's still operating today and the reef being completely submerged like that whenever men would come around there they would take a big gamble with their lives and and so they would listen for the bell but the poet tells the story the poet robert southie tells a story about the bell and he says no stir in the air no stir in the sea the ship was still as she could be her sails from heaven received no motion her kill was steady in the ocean without either sign or sound of their shock the waves float over the inch cape rock he said so little they rose so little they fell they did not move the inch cape bell and he talked about how that the abbott had put the bell on the inch cape rock on a boy in the storm it floated and swung and over the waves its warning rung and so they heard the bell didn't realize they were creeping up on disaster and so they dropped their anchor but the poem and i don't have time to read all of it but goes on to say that a pirate named robert the rover a wandering sort of fellow a wandering star decided he was going to cut down the bell because he wanted to wreak destruction on the people of that time and so he got angry because they put the bell up there and he was so confident in his own ability that he cut down the bell and then he went out and plundered the oceans and comes back with a great load of gold and silver and things that he's stolen and gets in a storm at the very spot where he cut the bell and his ship wrecked and he lost his life because he failed to put down an anchor oh god the bell was a warning and i think today it's kind of a long way around to tell it but i think in the storms of life sometimes we don't want to heed the warning the word of god is a warning to us god calls ministers as warning to us a warning a bell that's ringing and sometimes we don't want to hear it and so we cut the bell down and we do it to our own destruction heed the warning today put down your anchor in the word be stable don't disregard the message of the hour even in the little things say well i can get by with doing this don't disregard the message of the hour it's a bell warning you how to stay out of the shipwreck of the culture that you're in don't disregard the message and so that bell that that anchor is an absolute you got to put something down that that you're not that you're going to listen to the warning and put down an anchor and brother brandon said in the day that we're living in now everything is so breaking up so fragile and carried away he said i think this message would be a very appropriate thing to christians he said when they're going through their deep waters now he said the christian church is passing through the deepest water it's had for the last 2000 years because we're coming to a spot where there is something presented to christianity something they have to make a decision on he said and i think that the christian church ought to have something that they know they are tied to instead of just like floating about like a leaf upon the water the wind he said okay i'll have a good pastor i'll have a good church that's not what he's talking about he's talking about being tied to christ the word you need a good pastor you need a good church but what you need most of all is your life to be tight on the word right so now he says he says instead of just floating like a leaf upon the water as the bible said carried about by every wind of doctrine the winds come and blow the little leaf this way another wind comes the north wind the south wind the east wind the west wind he said you'll never get anywhere you're not stable the christian life should be a stable life it should be something that's a principle that you're tied to that is more than life itself he said you must have something that you're tied to some people are tied to their business some people are tied to their families some are tied to a creed some are tied to the army post we have different things that we're tied to but i think as a christian we ought to be tied where we know is right because you might be tied to your family your wife could leave you you might be tied to the army you might get killed you might be tied to any different things it's got an end but there's got to be a final type host there's got to be somewhere that man has got to tie for his eternal destination because if you're going to trust it in your work when your work is finished it's done when your family is taken it's over but there's only one thing i think is the final type of he said i believe that paul had a typos in his life here he said for me to live is christ to die is gain he said christ was paul's absolute it was his type post it was the end of all arguments it was christ amen oh do you believe that tonight christ has been your type post you don't have to fear the wind and the storm god's just having his way in the whirlwind amen paul had an anchor and i think jonah would learn as we continue on in the story uh well jonah another night i won't go into it tonight but as we continue on we'll find jonah would learn about the how god had things in his hand but right now he didn't understand that so he tried to run but paul understood it paul had been told he was he would give his testimony to caesar he had any but he had an anchor he had the word of the lord he knew his table in the storm and in acts 27 and 13 paul was involved in a storm and the wind blew in a contrary direction and finally and you got to watch because this is true of all of our lives that sometimes soft winds will blow and we think we're okay so we let up we take up the anchor how many of you ever been in that spot you get a good job you have a lot going for you a lot's going on and so soft winds are blowing and you say well i'm okay everything's okay i'll just drift we'll take up the anchor for a while and that's what they did the south wind blew softly better watch out there's a storm coming supposing that they had obtained their purpose losing thence they sailed close by crete but not long after oh isn't that always the story of our lives not long after we think we're okay all of a sudden there arose against it a tempestuous wind called yourocladine yorkledon he said when the ship was caught and could not bear up into the wind we let her drive that could not bear up into the wind is a fascinating expressive phrase because it's actually saying that they could not face up to the wind remember what we said about jonah jonah couldn't face up to the to what god told him to do and so he become a man running from the presence of god and the ship that paul was in could not face up to the storm and so even english sailors would would call the bow of the ship and they'd put eyes on it and they called it the eyes of a ship so the sailors let it drive or gave way because of the storm and so it was just run anytime you let a ship run it'll end up on the rocks he said and and so that they said that it was it was caught in the wind it could not face up to the wind and we let her drive but after a long and go down to verse 21 said after long abstinence paul stood forth in the midst of them and said sirs you should have hearkened unto me and not have loosed from crete remember when that soft wind was blowing he warned him he said don't do that don't let go of your anchor he said you should have hearkened he said and to have gained this harm and loss he said now i exhort you to be of good shear for there shall be no loss of any man's life among you but of the ship for there stood by me this night the angel of god whose i am and whom i serve look at the confidence that paul has i'm closing in just a moment so hang with me look at the confidence that that man has he said i know yes that we're going to make it all right oh i wish i could get that through to you and only you're going to make it peter you're going to make it yes brother j.t you're going to make it i know why do i know because an angel of god told me we had a prophet messenger in our day i don't have to see a vision or a dream or anything else to know that we're going to make it we had a prophet that said you'll crest every wave we had a prophet that said this end-time bribe would not be deceived you're going to make it oh my no matter what the storm looks like right now he said there won't be a loss of any man's life he said there stood by me this night the angel of god whose i am and whom i serve saying fear not paul thou must be brought before caesar and lo god hath given thee all someone say oh oh god hath given thee all them that sail with thee you might lose the ship you might lose the stuff but you're not going to lose the people yes oh god help us tonight you might lose the things of life but you won't lose to people god knew this storm was coming and he said we're going to make it hallelujah god hath given thee all them that sail with thee wherefore sirs be of good cheer they must have thought he was nuts it's in there and the boat's cracking up there's water seeping in everywhere the sailors are shouting and running and the ship is tossing and paul says wait a minute guys you're going to be okay sometimes we have to stand and say that in the world that we're living in we need to tell our children you're going to be okay you need to tell the church we're going to be okay we're going to make it right when it's cracking up on the rocks but i believe god what do you believe i believe god i believe god said we're going to make it i believe god above the wind i believe god above the storms i believe god above the hurricane above the sickness above politics right are you with me tonight i believe god above everything his word is true let every other word every man's word be alive and his to be true yes amen i believe god above the hurricane i believe god above the politics i believe god above the sickness yes i believe god above the hardship going on in my life right now yes look at jonah look at him now seemingly back sid out of the will of god running from the presence of the lord but jonah 117 said tells us this now the lord amen the lord had prepared had prepared he didn't have to go scrambling looking for a big fish trying to get him there on time think about the logistics of this god's the greatest logistician that's a word if that's how you say it that's ever been that's ever been on the earth because look what he does he he comes and and jonah is going to be driven in the by the wind he's going to leave thinking he's going all the way to the other side of the world the first night a storm comes up he's driven by the wind and we don't know whether he was driven towards the ocean or away from it but brother venom tells us that in some of those places it was a mile or two miles deep and down there a mile or two miles deep there's a there's a fish and knowing how god does things i'd say that fish was a baby one time didn't know what his purpose was didn't know what he was going to be but one day he kept growing and growing and growing and the other official came and said what in the world dude you need to go to the gym it's a big fish he just god likes big things and small things too right he's a bit this this this is a big fish he's begging to swallow a man and here he comes he gets keeps getting bigger and bigger and bigger he don't fit in anywhere and he's just wandering around the ocean thinking he don't have no purpose but suddenly he fills a pole to go when he reaches a certain size [Music] he fills a pole and gets hungry for backslidden profit so brother branham said he said god prepared a fish for jonah and a meal for the whale a meal for the fish he said it was a backslidden profit meal amen so he got down there and he happens to be in the right spot here comes jonah out of the boat splashes down the water and he sinks and he sinks and he sinks and there's a great big mouth my goodness just dropped right on me dinner biggest thing i've eaten in a while he swallows it whole he's so hungry oh my the lord had prepared anybody he don't say how long he took to do it so you don't understand at the other side of your storm god's already prepared the fish that's going to swallow you and taxi you to your destination brother brown said the fish was a taxi he's going to take jonah to a spot where he could get to the end of it he never was going to make it much farther than where he started but the fish would be a taxi oh my and so god prepared god's already prepared in the storm of your life a great fish to swallow you up and keep you yes oh my until you have a testimony i come through the storm but you know his greatest testimony wasn't coming through the storm we don't talk about jonah and the storm we talk about jonah in the belly of the well you imagine we'll get to him there next time but he goes down into the ocean and thinks oh that's the worst it could get not yet you're fixing to go into wells belly fixing to see what it's like on the inside of a well i can tell you it's not pretty if you've ever gutted a fish you know a fish's belly is not a pretty thing it gets on the inside of it and god has a talk with him oh my he has a talk with god yes the sovereign god had already prepared a way out of the storm but it wasn't any way that he could have imagined if you told jonah a day before that tomorrow night you're going to be in a whale's belly he wouldn't have believed you god didn't even tell him god don't tell his prophets everything he just let him go through it sometimes god just wants to let you go through it let him be god can we do that tonight in closing musicians go ahead and come see the exit from the storm is not what you think it is let god be god you've already prepared a way to fulfill his word in your life he said but brother ben if i don't rush if i don't hurry if i don't you know you know me those of you who have dealt with me very much you know i don't get in a hurry about much of anything when it comes to especially when it comes to the church i like things to move slow and there's a reason for that because because i'm always i always know that myself when i get into hurry i get in trouble that's how i end up with with uh uh things i can't afford you know what's that that first that inclination you buy it and then you get buyers remorse so they tell you to wait a night wait a couple days see if you still want it you won't have so much buyer's remorse move slow but the brandon said look 10 times and take one step you don't have to solve tomorrow's problems sufficient to the day is the evil thereof let god be god he's got a way out that you haven't even dreamed of yet you can't even imagine what he's going to do in your life [Music] who would have dreamed we'd have been here some of you elders that have been around for many many decades who would have dreamed we'd be here tonight who would have dreamed the world would be in the condition that it's in politics would be where it is the church would be where it is who would have dreamed it but god had a fish he something prepared for us to make us a sign and a living epistle right of all men in the day and hour that we live in don't give up he sees the other side of the storm he knows you're going to make it i love this quote but the brandon said remember where jonah went god was in the boat amen [Music] he was running from god but god was in the boat god was in the storm god was in the fish he went on being right along with jonah until his perfect will was done [Music] you might be in the boat tonight you might be in the fish you might be in the storm you might be things might be going pretty good might be some south winds blowing wherever you're at god's there let him take charge of your life he's already prepared a way to fulfill his word in your life would you bow your heads with me for just a moment as we meditate on the word of god tonight and think about these things maybe you just pray this way lord i i believe i believe you've got control of the winds i believe that the same god who sent the wind can take it back believe that the same god who who made who allowed some of the things that have happened in my life and yet many of them my own stupidity but yet god allowed it and somehow there's a fish prepared if i'll just believe his word and trust him from here on out even my own stupidity won't keep me from the promises even my own stubbornness won't keep me from the promises you just talk to him like they say lord i believe i believe that you you got a way prepared for me i don't have to force it i don't have to make something happen where it's not there i can just ride on the on in the boat if you if i end up in the fish i'll ride in the fish end up on the shore i'll walk towards nineveh i'll do what he tells me to do i'll follow his perfect will that's what we want to do god god bless you tonight heavenly father lord we love you help us not to get too caught up lord in the winds and the waves and the seas moving lord may we drop our anchor lord and then if we find ourselves even in the fish in a place where we never thought we would be oh god may we realize that those circumstances that we're in those symptoms that we feel and that we see with the five senses lord those don't mean anything they're lying vanities as jonah said but he said i'll look at your holy temple oh lord help us to see beyond what we can see and see through eyes of faith and see that you're the same yesterday today and forever i pray for these people tonight lord i pray you would encourage the young ones the teenagers the elders lord the young families or those that are watching tonight weren't able to be here i pray god that you'd encourage each one of them in their own stage of life or that you you've got control of the ship you've got control of the whale or the the fish you got control of the sailors everything that's happening you've got control of it lord may we realize that tonight may we trust you may we long to be in your perfect will every moment may we not let bitterness drive us from your presence may we always stay where we're supposed to be i pray and grant it now thank you for your presence that we felt here tonight and i pray that you'd anoint this word lord the things lord if i said something that's wrong take it out lord but lord out of even the people's memory lord where it's been right i i pray that it would sink down or the people would remember it daily lord as they go through life there's a there's an anchor lord that holds today we're so thankful for it lord we ask these things in your precious wonderful name we pray you'd heal the sick touch everybody lord heal every broken heart we pray in jesus name amen amen tonight do you believe it tonight let's stand together [Music] oh my do you believe that tonight
