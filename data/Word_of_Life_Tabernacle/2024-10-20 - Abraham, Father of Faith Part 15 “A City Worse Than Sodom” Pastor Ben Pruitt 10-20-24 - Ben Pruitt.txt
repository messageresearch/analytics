Genesis Chapter 18 and verse 16 I still don't have any monitor Esther I I usually have Peter running around fixing all this stuff and and getting it ready brother Joel and brother Peter on their way back from uh or brother yeah brother Joel and brother Peter with brother Andrew Glover from uh South Carolina they've been up at the meetings up there and uh so I usually have them uh to turn everything on in the morning when I get here and I forget how much I rely on them to do that but we're thankful that we've got people that want to help and and are willing to do that and that's like my right and left arm missing so we're going to do our best today Genesis 18 and 16 thank you for your donations for the uh flood relief we got all that out and that that that was nice you all did a wonderful job of of helping people and that's what we're here to do and uh well good to see you all good to have the I think I saw the pities this morning God bless you guys thank you for being here this morning and it's been a couple weeks since they've been here and then uh uh all of you that are that are here I see other visitors brother Daniel good to see you Sister Laura back in church with us today and each one brother Bruce you got a suit on I like that that's nice I appreciate coming dressed up to church and each one of you that are here this morning we uh we sure love you with all of our hearts we were at the tent meetings at brother Matt's and uh we uh we enjoyed that and uh but being out in the weather and things you know kind of makes you a little bit uh worried about catching a cold but uh but we didn't and so we're thankful for that and then but they had a wonderful meeting and the people just were really blessed seemed like over there and that's continuing this morning we'll close this morning so we're praying for them Genesis Chapter 18 and verse 16 the men rose up from then and looked toward Sodom and Abraham went with them to bring them on the way and the Lord said shall I hide from Abraham that thing which I do seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation and all the nations of the Earth shall be blessed in him said for I know him that he will command his children and his household after him and they shall keep the way of the Lord to do justice and judgment that the Lord may bring upon Abraham that which he has spoken of him I pray the Lord would add his Blessing to the word you may be seated eser these may be off like the the speaker itself might be turned off so if you could come check that we'll just all watch her as she comes up front you know when Abraham was receiving his visitation from Elohim life in Sodom goes on as usual there's no change there's no difference in uh in in it is it on showing on that power strip right there behind there might turn it on y'all forgive us this morning we don't know what we're doing life in Sodom goes on as usual when the Elohim is coming in a body of Flesh to Abraham to uh to bring to him a message that would change his body and you would think that something that uh great that would happen would actually uh would actually cause Sodom to sit up and notice that that they would know that he was there but they didn't know they went on doing whatever they would normally have done during that time they never knew because the angel that come to Abraham was only to the elect group he did not come to the World At Large he did not come uh to the uh to the sodomites he didn't come to gomorra he didn't come to the rest of the world he only came to uh AB Abraham the elect group and I'm so thankful that God thought enough of us that he sent a message our way that would come and actually would speak directly to the elect and the fact that you and I have heard that and that ought to make us the most happy people in the world that we could say Lord you spoke to me you brought a message my direction you came down to where I was aren't you glad for that today how many are happy that he come your to your house he come in your direction there it is he come down where you are amen oh I'm so thankful for that today I'm so thankful that he that he came to where I was and when he came to where I was he did not give he did not just uh just leave me in my condition but he changed me and he changed Abraham and Sarah from what they were back to a young man and woman again so uh now you're going to have to come turn this one down but we know a few things about Sodom Sodom was affluent it was affluent we know that the plain of Sodom was well watered everywhere the Bible says the soil was rich and the people had money and they had time to spare the Bible tells us that they were extremely sinful in Genesis 13:13 but the men of Sodom were Wicked and sinners before the Lord exceedingly now we know that the sin that they were known for was actually homosexuality but that is not the the cause of their that's the symptom of the sin that they were engaging in it's not a cause of it it's a symptom of it and so but we know that they were proud even of that extreme you know when a when a society gets to that point where there's so much perversion that it's not only accepted but it's celebrated you know that Society has completely fallen and it's about to it's about to go completely away and we know that that's what happened in in Sodom in Isaiah 3:9 it says the show of their countenance doth witness against them he said and they declare their sin as Sodom so in other words they're they're not ashamed of it they're they're proud of it and we literally have a month that in this in this day and age is called Pride month right and it's actually when they celebrate perversion and that's what they were doing in Sodom it's the same thing that they were doing there but I'm so glad that Abraham wasn't involved in that but he had another he had another way he had another place that uh that another thing that God had called him to so now uh in in in this we know that lot was in Sodom and we know that somehow they in Sodom while all this is going on with Abraham we know that Sodom was actually uh was actually uh uh in in a place where uh they were continuing on and and and lot was in the city and the Bible tells us he's set in the gate brother random calls him the mayor of the city he's actually the mayor of the city he's the one in charge of the business of the city and being that he's in charge of the business of the city lot is sitting there and he's watching all of this going on he's watching the men marrying men and he's watching the transgender movement and he's watching the pride of that City and he's watching are you with me this morning he's watching all of that and it bothers him he's not okay with it he he's not he it's not that he's actually uh that he's actually in a place where uh where he's enjoying it he's not enjoying it at all it bothers him that it's going on it bothers him that that it that it's actually uh that it's actually uh going on at that moment Now esther where'd you go now this is bothering me you going have to turn it back off this one on this side come on you can do it don't you hate wouldn't you hate to be a preacher's kid I tell you what but it bothered a lot maybe this is a good illustration right here it bothered him but he didn't do nothing about it right now the Bible tells us in second Peter 2:6 that he he turning the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah into ashes condemned them with an overthrow making them an example unto those that after should live ungodly thank you and delivered just lot we don't need microphones anyway I know you can hear me out there I just can't hear myself he said delivered just lot vexed with the filthy conversation of the wicked that conversation there is lifestyle so lot looked out at what they were doing and it vexed his righteous Soul it says for that righteous man dwelling among them in seeing and hearing and looking on Facebook and looking looking out on at the companies that were celebrating these things it vexed his righteous soul from day to day with their unlawful deeds and I think sometimes we look at that and say Well only the elect are vexed by that no even many men in denominational circles many men and women that are out here in these churches they're vexed by it but they can't do anything about it and many of them won't even speak up about it in their own churches vexed means tormented lot was actually tormented by the things that were going on oh church he he was his every time he saw it it bothered him just made him sick at his stomach but brother brand said the Bible said the sins of Sodom Vex the righteous soul of lot daily he but he just didn't have the plain nerve enough to stand out against it oh Church it it takes some nerve to stand against something but we've got to do it we don't do it because I I don't stand against uh error you know in in Doctrine because you all know me I want to get along with everybody I want there to be Unity I want that to happen but we got to stand for something we got to stand for something we don't stand against these things because we just like want to be different from people God help us if that's our purpose but we stand against sin because sin will not be tolerated by God and we know where that takes people we know what the end of that is he said well just let them do what they want to do but we know what if you don't stand against it then you don't care about people so he was vexed but he didn't speak out he was tormented but he couldn't say nothing how many of you ever known people like that huh they they they they know it's wrong many people will tell you you'll get in a conversation something like this well I know it's the end time right it's the end time and it being the end time they they recognize that the sin has grown to a point where it it's not sustainable anymore but yet they don't know what to do about it and they can't speak out against it because it's in their own family it's in their own church it's in their own Community it's in their own neighborhood and we'd all like to pre or we we'd all like to pretend that these things didn't happen right around us but they do now I'm just kind of building a foundation for where we want to go this morning but lot knew that it was wrong but he didn't have the nerve to stand out against it and brother Bram types that to a a a pastor in a congregation that sees people that are doing wrong won't say nothing about it he said look at their Congregation of bobhair women they know the Bible condemns it look going down the street a thrown church members going down the street with shorts on they know the word is against it but they haven't got the nerve to call out against it but yet the man profess to be a Christian his soul within him cries out against it but he hasn't got the nerve if that ain't modern Sodom where's it at and you know that's the truth because when you go out into the world today I've met many good men who pastored churches and if they were hold inness men to begin with they knew those things were wrong but they had two choices either have no church at all right or allow it to happen because everybody's going to leave but why can we preach it when others can't why are we we able to preach the word when many are afraid to do it why are we able to because we're preaching to the elect group we're preaching to a people who are not caught up in Sodom but you've heard the message of the hour and you heard the truth of the day and so your soul responds to it yeah you'd like to get along with everybody you'd like for everything just to go along smoothly but you know there's something in your heart that won't let you be like that you were called to do something different than that amen so the sin of Sodom fects his righteous soul brother Brandon said his soul cries out but he said he hasn't got the nerve if that ain't modern Sodom where is it at God give us somebody that'll cry out against it he said like John the Baptist said the axis laid to the root of the tree that's what we need today L is a type of the denominational Church down in Sodom he said watch the Bible says that the sins of Sodom vexed his righteous Soul daily why didn't you have nerve enough to stand out against it he said there's many a good man sitting in a church today looking out seeing women with shorts on men doing these things and their members going playing golf on Sunday and picnic parties and swimming and things instead of attending church I don't have a thing against swimming I don't have a thing against golf I don't have a thing against a picnic but if you're doing it instead of going to church you got a problem right but he said there's men that won't speak out against that why he said sitting home on Wednesday night watching television instead of attending church they feel like saying something about it but the board would put them out what's the matter it's lot again looking out his window and seeing the sin and afraid to call Sin Sin he said Abraham wasn't in their mess Hallelujah he was out of it oh I'm so glad of that today he was a type of the spiritual church right and that's I'll be honest with you that's why some people don't want a pastor they just don't want nobody to call out against it but as long as I'm in this body God help me I love each and every one of you but if I love you I got to tell you the truth God help me to cry out against it as bad as Sodom was we know they were bad right when you think of Sodom it just makes you feel icky it does the name's just uh it's bad and of course gomorah was there with it and other cities of the plane but there are two cities named in the Bible as worse than Sodom do you know that two cities that are worse than Sodom you find one in Ezekiel chapter 16 where Ezekiel actually CS or God speaks to Ezekiel and he says tell Jerusalem that they're worse than Sodom Jerusalem worse than Sodom now we feel pretty good standing here and saying well we stand against homosexuality we stand against perversion we stand against ungodly living and we do but there is actually a c there were cities worse than Sodom that were much more religious than Sodom but they were worse in their sin so Ezekiel presents Jerusalem as the adulterous wife of Jehova in Ezekiel chapter 16 we won't read it all you can go back and read it when you have time but Ezekiel 1648 he said as I live sayith the Lord God Sodom thy sister hath not done She nor her daughters as thou Hast done thou and thy daughters now look at this verse 49 behold this was the iniquity of thy sister Sodom Pride fullness of bread and abundance of idleness was in her and in her daughters neither did she strengthen the hand of the poor and the needy so he he goes back and and everybody knew what sodom's main sin was or what the fruit was of what they did what who the fruits were if you can say it that way everybody knew what what that was but but people didn't recognize what caused it what the condition was and the condition that existed in Sodom exists in America too and it existed before the sodomites become a widespread thing before the homosexual move movement become a widespread thing even back when people mainly spoke out against that and were against that even during that time they uh uh the the the conditions existed in America what was it pride fullness of bread abundance of idleness and a refusal to help when someone needed help God help us we don't act that same way I was so thankful this week because of all the that you gave for the flood victims those that you know but we know our first responsibility is for the church and there were some folks here and and brother Bill and sister Karen I've been trying to get to them and and and go see them and I just haven't had time with running back and forth and doing the things we're doing and I know some of you did and you took on meals and things and I'm so grateful for that why because you you're caring I don't have to tell you to do that you car care about people you care about people and I believe this is a church that cares about people and so we what creates that desire to help one another it's something in your heart that that that is put there you're not like the world you're not like the world when we say we're not like the world we we often look at our dress and we say well I don't wear a short tight skirts and I don't wear I don't wear tight shirts and I don't I don't men or women I if I'm a man I dress like a man if I'm a woman I dress just like a woman but that's not all together although that's part of it that's not alt together what it means to not be like the world but it means you care when they don't care it means you love one another when they don't love one another it means that you that you have a forgiveness in your heart when they hold grudges against one another to not be like the world means you're like Christ are you with me now and you you exhibit those virtues in your life so he identifies those conditions that exist and you find those same conditions in Rome at the at the time when Jesus was born those same conditions if you study history and you find them in modern day America so we find that this condition that the sodomites were in was birthed from a pride and soft living from pride and soft living and we find a a parallel to that in the Ley in church age which again is worse because it's in the church but Revelation 3:17 because thou sayth now he's not talking to the World At Large he's talking to the church age of leoa because thou sayest I am rich and increased with goods and have need of nothing and knowest not that thou art wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked church we got something I got something on my heart this morning I want you to see we don't want to be caught up in that we don't want to be part of that we want to be part of that elect group that's receiving Revelation that's repeating on the me message of the hour look he said I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire that thou mayest be rich and white rment that thou mayest be clothed that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear and anoint thine eyes with Isa that thou mayest see now but the random tells us that each age had its pressures and you talk about pressure if you go back to the Dark Ages when they were being killed for being Christians by other Christians many in many times when they were being killed and they would be put on the rack and stretch that's pressure right they'd say now okay if you don't if you won't bow to the church and say that Mary is the mother of God and worship idols then we're literally going to stretch you out until the limbs come out of your body and we're going to torture you until you confess you say that didn't happen that really did happen I've got a copy of Fox's book of Martyrs right back there in my office and you can read that it actually happened historically to millions of people and and there was blood on the hands of the Catholic church for doing that right because they they created that condition that was pressure but I say we have a greater pressure in this age because it's more deceptive brother Brandon said a great burden of the last stage is the pressure of riches now there's nothing wrong with being rich it's not money that's the root of all evil it's the love of money right it's not riches that create but it's the pressure of riches right it's the pressure of riches because with a greater standing in the Community comes a pressure that you may not want to really identify as a child of God anymore and that's what lot was under was the pressure of riches the pressure of living in Sodom where once maybe if he was up there with Abraham he could have identified with him and he would have said yeah them I would never be around them sodomites I would never let my daughters be subject to that I'd never let my children be subject to that but when he got around them there was a pressure that come from living in Sodom there was a pressure that come from being around him all the time and so the pressure of riches got to him and he couldn't speak out he was still God's man a righteous man but he wasn't the elect we've been called to something else now notice the pressure of riches and soft living you say brother Ben I live in Hardy Arkansas it only it only gets living only gets so soft in Arkansas but at the same time compared to other cultures compared to other people and I've been there some of y'all have been there you've been over some of y'all been overseas I know brother Herold has brother Mike has some of y'all been brother Allen's been to Alaska some of y'all been places you've seen some things and you've seen some people that did that had a hard living living in areas where it's winter all the time right why people would that's why no one retires up North you know and that there's a certain there's a certain pressure that comes with that or a certain amount of hard living there's amount of there's some hard living that goes with uh being in a society where there's corruption and graft although we're seeing that in our society but but it used to not be that way and we've got a remarkable political system up till now that's worked remarkably well he said brother Ben how can you say that because I've seen how the others work right and I've seen how they treat you if you're an American I've seen how they treat you and I've seen the way Egypt works I've seen the way West Africa works I've seen I've seen how it works in Asia I've seen it firsthand and I know the corruption and the things that are there and thank God for our country thank God for America I wouldn't want to live that way but with that soft living with those nice seats in your car I don't want to take a show hands embarrass you but how many of you have uh air conditioned seats several of you I love those things you know the invention of heated seats never did a thing for me but air conditioned seats changed my life my truck don't have them but her Britney's vehicle does and that's just if that went out I don't know what I'd do because I've gotten so used to that man I enjoy that soft living right it's not that it's wrong but it creates a pressure where you're never uncomfortable and if we are uncomfortable we seek Comfort right if we don't like to a certain place to eat we just go find somewhere else where you realize most of the world doesn't live that way they go eat where they can right we go eat where we want to even the poorest Among Us for the most part we don't eat what we don't want to eat huh we can buy what I was raised without air conditioning we were raised in our in our room mom and dad got a window unit for their room and man I was envious we were not allowed in their room so you just you talk about suffering when it's 100 degrees forgive me mom was 100 degrees outside and I knew that air conditioner was on in that room and it was so hot in the house but but you didn't think that much about it because because because that was just the way we lived but try to do without air conditioning now I mean I'm suffering this morning just because it's hot on the platform and I don't have monitors soft living are you with me now aren't you glad we've got the things that we do brother Isaac you've got uh things at your house and I know brother Isaac doesn't have a lot of money but he's got things at his house that the people in Africa would love to have right that that that that coffee machine nice isn't it and there's some things that are really nice at brother Isaac's house and and those of us even the poorest among us we got nice things but it creates a pressure and when we come to the house of God it's the preaching makes us a little bit uncomfortable we get nervous because we're so used to comfort but I think we need to get uncomfortable now and then we need to feel the prick of the Holy Spirit now and then it says when Peter got up and preached that sermon in Acts 2 it says they were PR in their hearts they were wounded in their Spirit they said Lord what can we do to be saved sometimes that's what it takes we got to get a little bit uncomfortable so we can receive from God God help us today so once again soft living listen what he says about I want to read the rest of that quote because it's important he say soft living and nervous tensions in a complex age so I'm not saying it's easy I know it's not I live under the same pressure you do that's why God calls men that live under the same conditions you live under to come and preach the word to you because it's more than just a word I could just stand up here and read scriptures or stand up here and read quotes and it would still what is coming out of the mouth of somebody who lives in the same world and has to overcome the same Devils you overcome I've got to do it just like you do now look it nervous tensions and accompl Le age that we seem unfitted to live in it seems like we're just not able to do it and so many young people get discouraged and even commit suicide or do something like that I'll say to you young people your life is always worth living you're valuable to God you mean something to God once again soft living has created the perfect conditions for a society to be so full of sin that a holy God is bound to destroy them and a prophet of God stood in our hand or in our day and said the hour is at hand great destructions are laying ahead worse than Sodom and gamor for this country brother random often quoted Jack Moore who said that if God lets this country get by with their sins you'll have to raise Sodom and Gomorrah and apologize to them brother brandom says it this way you're bound for judgment there's no other way to accept it write it down in your Bibles he said I'm getting to be an old man listen to this you see if it doesn't go to judgment he said if I live a normal life I'll see at normal time another few years will turn it will'll turn it what's been turned what's being turned what's happening is we we've turned to judgment the nation and the people don't even recognize it that they've turned away from Mercy they've turned away from the possibility of Revival and turned to judgment now we're talking about the Sodom group we're not talking about the elected group are you with me now we're talking about the Sodom group now Jerusalem was worse than Sodom because they knew better anduk Luke 13:34 Jesus is crying out he said oh Jerusalem Jerusalem which killest the prophets and stonest them that are sent unto thee how often would I have gathered thy children together as a hen that gather her brood under her wings you would not behold your house is left unto you desolate and verily I say unto you you shall not see me until the time come when you shall say blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord Lord brother brandom says don't you see the message of the hour can you recognize where we are the message itself from the scripture interprets to you the hour we're living in it's the interpretation listen church we need to get under the blood we need to get under the token we need to come under the headship of the message of the hour we can't live without it we'll go down just like everybody else without this message we're no different from lot what separated Abraham what separated him it was it was his faith and what the angel told him separated him God said I've forn Abraham I've known him I know how he'll teach his children brother BR said can't you recognize where we are the message itself from the scripture interprets to you the hour we're living in it's the interpretation Jesus said to Israel if you had only have known your day one time sitting on Mount oliv he looked over and said Jerusalem oh Jerusalem he wept he looked down he seen he said the other morning about 10 o'clock when I saw that prostitute Church remember the vision that he had how they were going out barely dressed he said this is the American church and they were dancing the rock and roll music and he said oh god what have I done and brother Bron when I saw that church he said down in your heart you feel the Holy Spirit dropping tears Jerusalem oh Jerusalem how of would I have hovered you but what did you do you killed the prophets that I sent to you you murdered them the very ones that could have helped you you killed them don't you realize that's still happening today because people are made uncomfortable by the preaching of the word they attack the messenger they attacked the messenger and the messenger's just for saying the message he's just giving the message right if you got a package you didn't like in the mail you wouldn't attack the mail delivery guy the maale man you wouldn't you wouldn't uh you wouldn't attack the FedEx man you wouldn't attack the UPS man why you know it come from somebody else but people attack the messenger when it's not the messenger's fault I'm just carrying a message are you with me now Jerusalem he said you feel the Holy Spirit dropping tears Jerusalem oh Jerusalem how off what I have hovered you but what did you do you killed the prophets you murdered them he said of the messages has been sent to the the church today has been murdered by their denominational dogmas oh Church don't you realize that's what Happ when you set something in your mind above the word and when the word comes and you reject the word in favor of what you already got in your mind do you realize what you're doing you actually murder the word you're killing the word because here's the word coming to you directly from the scripture directly from the from the message of the hour and when you hear the word and you will not receive it you say well it's not for me you actually kill the word murdered by their dogmas Jesus said if you'd have only know your day but it's too far now it's too late now he said so it is with the churches we know Jerusalem will repent and I I long for that day I you know we won't be here to see that we go home in the Rapture and then there will be a time that's described in Zechariah 12:10 he said I will pour upon the House of David and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem the spirit of Grace and of Supplication and they shall look on me whom they have pierced they shall mourn for him as one mourneth for his only son and shall be in bitterness for him as one that is bitterness for his firstborn they're going to recognize what they turned down why they were blinded for our sakes they became worse than Sodom for you and me oh Church they were treated in such an awful way if you think about the things that have happened in Jerusalem especially the sack of the city by the Roman general when he come through there and he destroyed and burnt the temple and destroyed everything and the people the only ones that survived were the Christians who got out of there don't you realize oh church that that is going to be turned back to them again and they're going to be given an opportunity and 144,000 of them will receive it amen the second city that is spoken of in the scripture as worse than Sodom is capernium capernium now that's kind of random isn't it just a little city not a major city of the Earth but capernium Matthew 11:23 he said thou capernium which art exalted unto Heaven shalt be brought down to hell for if the mighty Works which have been done in thee have been done in Sodom it would have remained until this day but I say unto you that it should be more tolerable for the land of Sodom in the day of judgment than for thee why it was just a normal City a beautiful Seaside Town it was a town with a population of Jews but it was built by Gentiles it was just a normal City it it may have been the one of the best cities as far as to live in that day in in Israel there's no mention of perversion in the city of Capernaum no mention of a gay rights parade no mention of no mention of of a rainbow flag that they're using to to promote the pride of homosexual no mention of that in fact the people that live there whether they worship the Roman gods or many Jews that live there worship the Jehovah and they thought they were doing pretty good and they thought they were pretty normal people but Jesus lived there now look at look at Matthew chapter 4 Matthew 4:12 when Jesus heard that John was cast into prison he departed into Galilee and leaving Nazareth he came and dwelt in capernium so he come to live in capernium which is upon the Sea Coast in the borders of zebulun and nephelim that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Isaiah the prophet saying the land of zebulin the land of nepin by the way of the sea Beyond Jordan gilee of the Gentiles the people which set in darkness saw great light and to them which set in the region and shadow of death light is sprung up and from that time Jesus began to preach and to say repent for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand listen to me church when the son of man was revealed in our hour what happened when a message come to our day it was Jesus Christ coming back to live among us again just like he lived among them he lived Among Us I'm not just talking about brother brandom now although he revealed himself in that body he borrowed that redeemed body I'm talking about a church of bride he wants to live in he is living in he come to the lost sheep of the House of Israel in a gentile community and lived with them five of Jesus 12 disciples were from capernium Peter Andrew James and John and Matthew many of Jesus greatest Miracles were performed in capernium I just go through a few of them the Roman Centurion you remember the one that he was he was the Roman Centurion there at capernium and when Jesus when he sent for Jesus he he said his daughter is very sick and and he said I'll Jesus said I'll come and he said no he said I'm a man under Authority and he said I know if you speak the word she'll be made whole she was made whole in capernium oh my Peter's mother-in-law lived in capernium so it is possible to have a good relationship with your mother-in-law because she lived with him it's all right you can laugh if your mother-in-law's sitting here don't laugh but Peter's mother-in-law was there and when the evening was come it says in Matthew 8:16 you remember he healed her of a fever and when the evening time came they brought unto him many that were possessed with devils and he cast out the spirits with his word I was reading a man sent from God if you haven't read it it was written very early in brother bram's Ministry but if you read William brandham a man sent from God take that and read it and and just begin to go over some of the things that happened it was so Supernatural but one of the things that Jack Moore says in that book in his his chapter of that book he he wrote in there that he said before many of us Pentecostal preachers got prayed through brother brandom had already had already spoken to the person and they were healed said so said before we could even get prayed up to begin to pray you know and and I'd let you in on a little secret sometimes why we pray so hard we're praying through so we can pray come on church because you you you we've got you know you got to be in the right attitude and the right atmosphere to pray but really we ought to be in that way all the time right and brother Bram lived in such a channel and such a place that he said he could just speak to him and they'd be healed and before they could even pray he just prayed a simple prayer and they were healed and so uh that's what Jesus was doing he said he he cast out the spirits with his word and healed all that were sick do you believe he still does it today he still cast out Devils brother BR said the preaching of the word cast out Devils he said that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Isaiah the prophet saying himself took our infirmities and bear our sicknesses capernium was his own City that's the way it's described in the Bible in Matthew 91 it says he entered into a ship and passed over and came into his own City it was there he healed a man with py and forgave his sins you remember the Pharisees questioned him about it they said how can you forgive a man his sins Matthew 9:7 says he arose and departed to his house he lived in capernium for the first part of his ministry but when the multitude saw it they marveled and glorified God which had given such power un men now remember he never had his own he had a place where he where he stayed I believe he stayed with Peter there in capernium so it's not that he owned a house because we know he gave all of that up for us he said foxes have dens but the son of man doesn't have a place to lay his head but we know that he stayed there with Peter in his house so that was he departed to his house when the multitude saw it they marveled and glorified God which had given such power to men it was done publicly the whole town knew who Jesus was what his address was where you could find him he called Matthew in capernium as we already said he raised gyrus his daughter in capernium right so the Centurion the the ruler of the synagogue right the pastor was a secret believer in the message oh my and so he he he he revealed he was there it was near there where he revealed the secrets of the heart of the woman who touched the Hemm of His Garment these are all familiar stories that happened near capernium they would have known about it they saw it publicly they saw him say who touched me and revealed the secrets of her heart he healed two Blind Men and touched a dumb man in capernium and the Bible says when the was cast out the dumb spake and the multitudes marveled saying it was never so seen in Israel but the Pharisees said he casteth out Devils to the prince of devils those Pharisees still alive today they just found YouTube right they found Wikipedia right and that's they still criticize the message and the messenger but they just found a different platform verse 35 said Jesus went about all the cities and Villages teaching in their synagogues and preaching the gospel of the kingdom and healing every sickness and every disease among the people all the mighty Works were done in capernium remember in Nazareth he couldn't do many mighty works because of their unbelief but when he went to capernium he did many mighty Works they received a great visitation it was in capernium in the synagogue that he preached his great sermon about the bread of life John chapter 6 and verse verse 41 when he got done preaching to him he the Jews then murmured at him because he said I am the bread which come down from heaven and they said is not this Jesus the son of Joseph whose father and mother we know how is it then that he saith I came down from heaven he said eat my flesh and drink my blood it was too much for him these things said he John 6:59 go read it I don't have time this morning but these things said he in the synagogue as he taught in perum and he said many therefore of his disciples verse 60 when they had heard this said this is a hard saying who can hear it capernium is where his ministry turned from healing to the word when he left his second pole you know what I'm talking about left his second pole for the third pole Ministry was in capernium and it says from that time many of his disciples went back and walked no more with him why because of the opening of the word oh and it's at this moment that he began to upgrade the cities wherein most of his mighty Works were done because they repented not he said wo unto you cor and woe unto you beta for if the mighty Works which were done you had been done in Ty and siden they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and Ashes but I say to you it should be more tolerable for Ty and sidon at the day of judgment than for you and thou capernium which art exalted un Heaven shall be brought down to Hell if the mighty Works which have been done they had been done in Sodom it would have remained to this day but I say unto you it shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom in the day of judgment and for the both of those cities the populations of those cities everybody will come before him on that day and the greater judgment will go to capernium than to Sodom now listen to me this morning we believe that the son of man revealed himself in this day making Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever that's what we've been preaching about with Abraham it's the revealing of the son of man Elohim in a body of Flesh listen if capernium was worse than Sodom and I prove to you the only thing that capernium did is they turned down the word after they saw the Miracles what about Jeffersonville right now we're going to bring a little closer to home in a minute what about Jefferson I'm not talking about the the message people there I'm talking about the city right what about Jeffersonville brother brandom taught us that our Lord had more success in the in his ministry than he did in his own we know that's true just by virtue of time brother Jesus was only here for three and a half years brother brandom for more than 20 years uh went around the world and he did that he had more more success in the ministry of William brandham than he did in his own brother Bram said he had more success in the Tabernacle than he did in capernium remember that when Jesus spoke that sermon of the bread of life he was in the synagogue of capernium and that's why he said woe unto you capernium he stood behind that Pulpit preach to those people brother brand stood in Jeffersonville and preached to those people and he said this he had more success right here than he did in capernium or Nazareth in that he done more miracles right here in this Tabernacle than he did in the entire Ministry on Earth that's right he did it he said what about the rest of the world Oh my he said now that's what he done remember he done it never said I done it no because I didn't do it I just loved him and just submitted myself to him you want to do something for God how many of you want to do something for God you want to see the presence of God in your life you want to see God move and help somebody through your life how you going to do it how you going to do it just submit yourself to him love him Hallelujah and said what he said and the Holy Spirit went to the other people and they believed what he said that's me I believe what he said and he done the work that's all let me go a little further say well jeffersonville's in a bad spot then on the day of judgment what about Jonesboro we're just gonna keep coming closer to home what about Jonesboro brother bram's Ministry when he left home when the angel come to him he got up in his pulpit and he told the story in 1946 and some of the supernatural things that had happened and they heard about it in St Louis and a man from St Louis sent for him brother dhy I believe is his name he sent for him and he healed his daughter or the Lord healed his daughter through that Ministry there in St Louis and then they got word about that in Jonesboro brother brand was actually in Jonesboro in 1946 and in 1947 but when he went to Jonesboro the word had spread of what had happened it was one of his first meetings but word there had been enough happened people begin to find out about it and brother Brandon said everywhere I go I meet people from Arkansas he said it was one of my first places to go to after I left St Louis we was at the KE Auditorium went down into Arkansas and I never forget those people how they come he said oh he said there was 28,000 people the newspaper said in Jonesboro and the city is about 8 or 10,000 I guess population it's a lot more than that now but he said for 30 miles around the city was nothing now think about this for a minute some of you drive from Jonesboro near there to come to church for 30 miles around the city all the farmhouses taken up tents built and things people living in it under old trucks brother Brown was quoting a newspaper article that I read this week about this he said people raining I'm going to show show you some things from the article in a moment he said people raining it'd be raining the people holding little pieces of canvas and newspapers over their sick folk just waiting for them to be prayed for he said it didn't make any difference if they got in this week or next week whenever it was it'd be all right oh my you imagine the people waiting out the elements it's it's basically a swamp anyway right especially brother Brandon was on Matthew Street at Bible Hour Tabernacle and so the people there wasn't no room for him and there was no building in Jonesboro at that time that could possibly hold all of those people and so the people were just waiting outside to be prayed for in through the rain brother brand talked about how he saw something that he said maybe moody or sanki would have seen he said I was in Corning Arkansas some of you come through Corning to come to church he said I was in Corning Arkansas he said I saw young ladies he said with the uh with the their bare feet he said their stockings in their hand people don't wear stockings much anymore he said they had their stockings in their hand and they had uh they had their shoes in their hand because they didn't want to get them dirty so they were walking barefoot to the meeting oh my now look brother brand said some of the most outstanding Miracles that I've ever seen done in America was did there some of the M most outstanding Miracles that he ever saw done in America was did there I think I have a picture or two if I can see this the that's from the newspaper you can't see it real well but that's an actual picture from the newspaper it didn't rely on a second Source I went to the newspaper itself and got this picture that's from the Jonesboro son in 1946 I believe it was and that's where the woman on the left brother Brand's praying for her who's sick the woman in the middle is Sister Hattie waldrip if you've heard brother Bram talk about her she's from Phoenix Arizona that was raised from the dead there was another man raised from the dead during that meeting at Jonesboro this man on the right is an xgi brother Bram talks about him at least in one place in the message where his uh his feet and his legs and everything were swollen from cancer their pictures were in the paper that these people came and their testimonies of how they were healed and so I think I've got another uh slide on there and this is the Articles from the newspaper at that time that uh all the people that came from 20 States and and how they drove thousands of miles to come and and all the things that it says about them and and and and and of course the newspaper was skeptical but they had to admit the attraction and they had to admit what happened now brother brandom talks about it and they tell the story in this article there's more to the article than what you see there but they tell the story if you go to that next quote uh where he said there's where a minister standing at the platform a big cancer hanging on him he said hanging on his neck the doctor said there's no chance for him standing there with the reporters stand there flashing the pictures that cancer turned white fell off of his neck and rolled over my feet he said I got it in alcohol now you talk about miracles right and that was told in that article how that happened and how the men testified of it there was a pit in his neck in his picture in the paper showing there was a man who sat in a wheelchair I didn't find the picture but I found the article talking about it he said there was a man who sat in a wheelchair for I forget how many years bound down like this was sitting there in the chair a Baptist Deacon and he said in a moment he got up out the chair and walked through the building glorifying God and things like that brother BR or brother Ivy one time before I came to church there he told me that he was preaching and he was preaching about uh the blind man that uh John John Ryan I believe his name was the blind man that was healed and testified of his healing and a woman a Pentecostal woman came to the service that night and she sat there and she got all excited because she thought they were talking about the same one she knew about and what she knew about was the blind man from kennet and she had been a witness that this man was blind and and they were driving him on the road from kenon somewh going back towards popular Blu and his eyes came open and brother Brandon tells the story how he testified all over this part of the country brother Brandon preached in Corny and moar he preached in paragold at the at the at the Oneness Church in paragold brother Brandon preached there he preached in Jonesboro he preached in Camden he preached in Eldorado he preached all through Arkansas and Hot Springs preached all over Arkansas if capernium will answer think about it for a minute what about Jonesboro what about kennet what about Memphis where brother BR preach many times and where the the woman was or the young man was healed that that brother Brandon was led the plane was stopped and he was led down and you can still go down in that area somewhere down in the area where Bass Pro is now where brother where the angel of the Lord LED brother brandom to go down where a where a a mother was standing there by her by her fence where her picket fence waiting on a prophet she said I'm the shite woman where is my Elijah God did that there was a blind girl from Memphis I've told you the story because it struck my heart I preached you a a message about a preached all over the world actually about Simon and how he picked up the cross picked up Jesus cross and and and brother Brandon was always reminded of that story whenever he'd see a a black person come in the prayer line and he would pray for them like this he said this Sim this one of Simon's children Lord that carried your cross and so there was a little blind girl that brother Brandon meets Out Among the throne he' slipped out to get a breath of fresh air and there's people crowded in there and this blind girl gotten separated from her daddy and she's looking for him and she comes up there and she begins to I said where's my help me help me and he said can I help you and she said just show me where my daddy is she said oh or she said take me to the Healer she said if you can take me to him my eyes will come open and I'll find him myself and brother brandham told her who he was and prayed for and her eyes come open happened right there in Jonesboro brother brandham talked about that and he people began to notice that and brother brandham saw some brothers in the crowd he was looking for he makes his way towards those Brothers he said just I started towards them there was an old brother I never will forget he had a club he had a crooked foot he was standing like this he said I know you brother brandom he said I've been standing in this rain for 8 Days said tell me what to do and God will back your word we talked about that's why when with the Pentecostal world this wasn't message people the Pentecostal World said Bible times are here again right now look tell me what to do and God will back your word I said you with all your heart you believe he said said with all my heart I said throw away your club and be whole in the name of the Lord Jesus he threw his Club away and made out a scream and up in the air he went jumped down he come just as normal as any man begin to screaming sometimes we read these quotes but we don't realize these people were real people I was sitting in a service Friday night brother Forest farmer was sitting back there and I'm sitting on the up close to the front of that tent meeting and I was able to see brother the forest and I'm watching brother the forest as brother Wayne Lawson preached on a miracle working God and I'm sitting back there watching brother forest was reminded of the fact that brother Forest as a child had a club foot and brother Brandon prayed for him and he was healed and a living testimony most parts of the world they don't have that we have it there's got to be a reason church I was watching those people over there and I've seen many of those people I've been in this area I was thinking last night I've been preaching down in that area for 23 years and in this area for for a little longer than that and as I was preaching I remember preaching down there when everybody was kind of together and I seen some unity in the meeting and I really so appreciated that seeing that but I'm watching those people and we're seeing second generation third generation fourth generation fifth generation maybe sixth generation coming on message people many of you are third generation fourth generation Believers some of you are coming message on your own but many of you were bornn in message families we were greatly privileged to live where we live to be where we're at think about those people in capernium think about how that they they they were so greatly privileged to have Jesus down the street where they could go down the street and they could knock on his Door Church they could knock on his door and they said Jesus my daughter is sick and he he'd lay his hands on and they she'd be healed Jesus do you realize we have that same kind of access today we we don't live down the street from he lives in our heart we can knock on his door and if we're sick we can ask for healing if we're weary we can ask for help if we're if we're struggling with addiction we can ask for overcoming power whatever it is we're struggling he's right here Among Us I'm stirred this morning look at this as I begin to look at this just as we come through the Abraham series and begin to look at that Sodom and how that compares with those cities worse than Sodom we're still blessed with living Witnesses of what happened the ctis aren't here this morning uh but I thank God you you realize they were there during th those some of those days some of you were some we got some other Elders that were here either right during that time or right after and those that generation is passing on now look we're still blessed with living Witnesses but many of the folks most of the folks from from that 47 Revival 46 and 47 are gone but brother Bron said there's where the blind was seeing the deaf was hearing now listen what he says and the ministry tonight this was in 1964 is a 100 miles beyond that why was the opening of the word he said but the Revival fires has died down let me bring it a little bit closer if Jonesboro if Jonesboro received a what about Hardy Arkansas and we like to look at all the things that have happened and and some of them bad that have happened but look what God has done in Hardy Arkansas how will we escape if we neglect to hear the message we can't say it never come to our city we can't say families were never exposed to it we have no excuse when it comes to that Hardy Arkansas I'm preaching now to you and to us how will we escape if we neglect to hear the message we can testify to more than natural healing we can testify after the opening of the word that many who believed that and sat right here in this church and lived and died saints of God who were who had all kinds of stuff in lives and they were overcame that and they become pillars in the church we have are witnesses of the changing the transforming power of Jesus Christ we Are Witnesses why are there so many Believers in Jonesburg why are there so many in this area in in in the we could say the greater Jonesboro area why are there so many Believers around Dyersburg why are there so many Believers in Hardy Arkansas God specially visited this area he he visited us how will we escape if we don't take our responsibility step up to the plate believing this message has healed Our Sick changed lives restored Fellowship you say what but this has happened or that's happened let me tell you what it's done I'm tired of negative testimony let me tell you what it's done for me let me tell you it's changed my life let me tell you it's changed my family put us on a different trajectory because I know what I would be without the message of the hour the problem with some of you don't recognize what you would be without the influence of the message on your life you don't realize it and so but some of you been there you know what the what it was without the message without that influence and you know what you are today and God has transformed you you're a miracle we got miracles sitting right here in the church we got we ought to give God glory for that we got miracles of healing we've seen cancer healed we've seen leukemia taken away we've seen we've seen God work but we've seen God change the lives as they go into the little room of the word as they come through the opening of the word we've seen God do it we're Witnesses brother JT over the years we're Witnesses of God moving I am without excuse we are without excuse how could we sit through a service with a bad attitude knowing what we know seeing what we've seen how can we pick and fight at one another and fuss at one another I told a brother this week we have a responsibility not to present that to the people of this area we got a responsibility not to fuss and fight and present that to the people we've been given a great gift what are we going to do with it probably per capita there's more message people in this in this area than there are anywhere else that may be a good thing or a bad thing but it's what you do with it we're responsible to it listen we're responsible not just us but every corner of the world listen in in this area there's churches on every corner but every corner of the world there's churches of this message I recently found out about some in in uh uh over on by the Alps and in Nepal there's Believers there and there's in every island in every country there's Believers in every country of the world even in Egypt where we went where we preaching brand new to people the people were hungry to hear about a miracle working God and we were still telling the story and telling them that that were updating and saying that's not just a god of yesterday it's the same yesterday today and forever I've stood there myself self church and I feel the responsibility of it because I know there's people there oh that God would raise up missionaries people who were willing to work people who are willing to go out because I know there's hungry souls and there's nobody to go either because of lack of resources or or just a lack of willingness or it's a dangerous place but somebody went that's why you're here somebody preached that's why you're here brother Paul you're such a witness of that and I've told that story over and over again how somebody in Africa witness to brother Paul about this message that's why he's here today because the message went all the way to Africa you talk about predestination he went all the way to Africa to speak to a man in Africa to speak to brother Paul to bring him back here to Arkansas oh Church don't you realize what God has done in our day listen if you don't that ought give you courage that'll encourage you today if your children aren't where they should be remember God's going to get them somehow if he's got to have somebody from Africa speak to them somehow there's go that God would send missionaries into Hardy Arkansas missionaries into Kenan missionaries into West Plains as brother Brandon spoke in Jeffersonville he said all that we had in Jeffersonville thousands of lived voices we need the same thing in Hardy Arkansas how many folks have walked to the front of this church and been healed over the last 24 or five years years that this building's been here how many have nelt at the altar many of you have and been changed meetings everywhere churches on every corner we're responsible to it we have a responsibility we've got to feed on it we got to feed on the body word of the son of man the brand said this I'm closing in just a moment I know I've been long but I'm moved this morning to say this the modern Pentecostal move started in Los Angeles California on isusa Street brother Brandon preached in that City over and over again showing the sign of the Messiah it was so heartbreaking I listened to brother Brandon preaching Jehovah Gyra number two I believe it was in 1960 when he preached or 62 when he preached it there in in in that area in the California area he's preaching there and and when he preaches to those people he's trying to show them how that Abraham the one that was with Abraham had his back to the tent and revealed the secrets of Sarah's heart he's showing them that and he kept turning his back and showing them what God had done but every time he turned around to do it and someone is speak in tongu somebody prophesy and that's wonderful but it's not the message of our day that's not our Focus today that's not our emphasis today I believe in tongues I believe in Prophecy I believe in interpretation that's not the emphasis the people missed it because they were looking at what they already had and brother Brown finally told him he said if you won't believe this believe your gifts but we've got something even greater than that I'm not saying we've done away with that we haven't in all oh that God would make every one of you tongue speakers and and prophesied I pray that God would do that for all of us but we know that not all speak with tongues but we can all be filled with the Holy Ghost are you with me now we can all be filled with the Holy Ghost and if it's the Holy Ghost operated by love it'll operate in order but now look what's happening look what's happening it's a responsibility that we have and and brother brandham stood there and they would not accept the responsib they wouldn't move on into the message of the hour and brother Bram stood there when he preached choosing of a bride as people when they heard that sermon were streaming out the back door been told by people who were there streaming out the back door leaving as brother Brandon preached as he got serious toward the end of the sermon he said that is a solemn warning we don't know what time and you don't know what time that this city one day is going to be laying out here in the bottom of this ocean people tell you they know what time don't know what they're talking about but he said oh capernium said Jesus thou who exalted into heaven will be brought down into hell for if the mighty Works have been done in Sodom and Gomorrah it have been standing to this day in Sodom and Gomorrah lays in the bottom of the Dead Sea and capernium is in the bottom of the sea go look at it in history where did capernium end up the same fate of Sodom and Gomorrah ended up in the bottom of the ocean thou City who claims to be the city of the Angels who has exalted yourself into heaven and sent all the dirty filthy things of Fashions and things they'll even the foreign countries come here to pick up our filth and send it away your fine churches and Steeples so forth the way you do remember one day you'll be laying in the bottom of the sea your great honeycomb under you right now the wrath of God is beling right beneath you how much longer he will hold this Sandbar hanging out over that is a modern Sodom and Gomorrah but the faith of this city there's way more influence of the message today than Los Angeles has where will we stand in the day of judgment he said that ocean out yonder a mile deep will Sid in their Plum back to the salt and sea it'll be worse and the last day of Pompei repent Los Angeles listen repent the rest of you and turn to God the hour of his wrath is upon the Earth flee while there's time to flee I'm so glad God gave us a space of time I'm so glad it didn't end in 77 which is as far as brother brand could see because of the darkness I'm so glad it didn't end s because I wasn't born yet but I was born for a purpose you were born for a purpose flee while there's time to flee and come come to Christ listen Paul put it this way to the Hebrew Believers how shall we escape if we neglect look at the word he uses there neglect not how should we escape if we're never exposed to it no if we neglect so great salvation if we neglect oh my we've heard church you you've heard Great Men preach in this pulit over and over again you've heard God God has coming I feel like a poor representation of a Preacher but you've heard Great Men stand in this pulpit and preach we've all heard it I've been all my life I've heard the preaching of the gospel I've heard those tapes I've heard nearly every one of them every one that I know of I've heard and I've listened to them I listen to him constantly how will I escape if I neglect so great salvation which at the first began to be spoken by the Lord and was confirmed unto us by them that heard him notice how it came down it was confirmed unto us by them that heard him God also bearing them witness so it wasn't just Jesus but the apostles did signs and wonders it wasn't just brother Brandon but in our day we've seen men of God come and preach the gospel over and over again where are you at Hardy Arkansas where will you be in the day of judgment I say that to our church and to every Church you see me I'm not interested in fighting I'm not interested in seeing who has the biggest church I'm interested in Souls where are we at where will we be if we don't repent and turn to God where will we be we've heard too much we've seen too much some of your families have been impacted I know the white Camp family the Raper family you all have been impacted by the message and and your grandmother and things and different ones that have been in the meetings and where will we be I go to Africa and then Brothers ask me say what's it like to be near Jonesboro it breaks my heart what kind of report will I go back with and say well the people are all broke up and divided and nobody can get along and everybody's fighting and fussing and everybody's so worried about their own little existence so they don't have time to testify I don't think that's us I pray that it's never us but may there be May there be a testimony yes there's still a church in Hardy Arkansas there's still a church there's still churches near Jonesboro Arkansas that still are living off the same life that came through in that hour the same Revival that came as it come through the first pole the second pole and the third pole that's the hour we're living in you may not see uh things happening miraculous things happen all the time but they still happen it's still in the body but what's God doing he's proving us by his word will we hold on to it will we believe it will we will we do what God promise will we do what we're supposed to do with what God brought us what will we do with the promises there come a time when God LED Moses by a pillar of fire and he led him by a cloud but when Joshua came he' come in place the people and there was no great signs or wonders huh are you with me once the water was parted and they went into Canaan what happened they had to fight for every inch of ground huh the filler of fire become a man right and led Joshua Church become the angel of the Covenant that led Joshua you and I've got to take our land it's time be strong and of good courage there was another group and musicians you can go ahead and come so I can I'll quit there was another group Abraham was different he wasn't in Sodom we are in America we're not of America we don't live and die on elections Our Fate will not be decided by what happens in November it'll be decided by what it already has been decided by what has already happened in heaven our election is not of this world our election is from another land the fate of this world might be decided by what happens in November but that's not us we're up on the hill with Abraham amen when Jesus got done rebuking capernium he said this at that time Jesus answered and said I thank thee Oh father have you ever put those things together he gets done rebuking capernum he said oh Father Lord of Heaven and Earth because thou has hid these things from the wise and prudent and Hast revealed them unto babes even so father for it seemed good in thy sight Peter was arrest of capernium remember and Jesus spoke and said capernium he said you're worse than Sodom Peter was a resident of that City and when the everybody left him and Jesus began to turn towards his word ministry and so many wanted to stay in the first Pole or stay in the second pole and he was turning to that to to his word ministry preaching about him being the bread of life and he stood there and he began to he began to talk to him and when he began to talk to him what happened he Peter he said will you go as well and Peter said to whom shall we go thou alone H has the words of life oh that there would be a resident of Hardy Arkansas that could say that thing today to whom should we go you alone have the word of life I was attracted by signs I was attracted by Miracles but that's not what has kept me what's kep me was the opening of the word it was the prophet revealing the mysteries of the hour amen but Abraham was separated from Sodom like Peter and the disciples by the Angel's message and the Lord said shall I hide from Abraham that thing which I do seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation and all the nations of the Earth shall be blessed in him for I know him he will command his children his household after him they shall keep the way of the Lord to do justice and judgment that the Lord may bring upon Abraham that which you have spoken of they will not make deals with the devil they will not sit there look out the window and see the sin and not cry out against it but they will be people who live for God who do what it takes to have the power of God in their lives he said he won't let his children follow the ways of Sodom you believe my message teach his sons and daughters that the message still matters don't get the message confused with people get the message confused with preachers if a preacher Falls that's not the message if people fall that's not the message teach your sons and daughters at the message matters why does it matter Sodom was destroyed by fire capernium was under the sea Los Angeles will be destroyed in an earthquake but we are not of those Lot's wife died when she looked back at Sodom but Sarah didn't die when she laughed at the promise why she was part of Abraham she was called out you and I have been called out where do we stand you play something softly America it's worse than Sodom but there's a group of people getting ready to leave this world where resp responsible I was listening last night to brother Jonathan Martin preaching he preached at the end he began to just Hammer home our responsibility to the message we're responsible he talked about how that that uh and I'd already written the these notes and he he was talking about how we're responsible and it just thrilled my heart cuz I see God is speaking to us responsible to the message talking about how that uh we're responsible to be like you know not a man running from the presence of the Lord but a man that'll face up to his responsibility a mother that'll face up to her responsibility a people that'll face up to the responsibility not to be victims but to be children Sons and Daughters of God where do we stand Elohim has revealed to him himself to us by his word I turned on last night the message where brother jolas and brother brother Donnie Reagan was preaching in in South Carolina and I turned that on just for a minute and he was talking about the same thing or responsible to the message oh Church he's trying to tell us something we have a responsibility let's face up to it and say I'm going to come to church believe in God I'm going

your children more than anything else amen do you love [Music] him I just feel like standing here weeping I don't know what else to do I'm I don't feel you're irresponsible I'm not saying that saying

one here maybe some sitting here have never been born again and that's why the struggle is there they want to believe the message they want to come and they want to do what's right but there's that struggle they need a new birth in their life help them to know that Lord and how will we receive that by being baptized in the name of Jesus Christ repenting of our sins and receiving the gift of the Holy Ghost I pray Lord if there's one here without the baptism of the Holy Ghost may they receive it this morning it's too late an hour we will not go in without the token I pray you help us today
