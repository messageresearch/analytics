[40:22] for that tonight
[40:24] in Revelation chapter 6 and verse 7 will
[40:27] go right quickly into the word tonight
[40:28] I've got quite a bit in this fourth seal
[40:31] we're trying to get condensed into this
[40:33] one service so we'll do that and I hope
[40:36] you've enjoyed the uh so far the
[40:38] overview that we've done the brief
[40:40] overview I hope it inspires you to go
[40:42] back and look uh in the seals and begin
[40:45] to study some of these things I believe
[40:47] we know where we're at and we know what
[40:49] time we're living in and I I think you
[40:52] think well that's something I learned
[40:54] years and years ago I have found things
[40:57] that I had forgotten things that I
[41:00] didn't know
[41:01] Revelation and things that I maybe I've
[41:04] not even presented all of it to you but
[41:06] as I've studied these things I thought
[41:07] you know it's been good for me and and
[41:10] so I hope it's been good for you too
[41:12] sometimes we just need to take a step up
[41:14] and say brother Ben I'm going through it
[41:16] right now I've got trouble in my life
[41:17] got trouble in my home got trouble in my
[41:19] body well sometimes you need to take a
[41:22] step up with the with the anointing of
[41:24] the Age The Eagle anointing to be able
[41:26] to see up above all of that stuff and
[41:29] looks over Church Strife looks over all
[41:31] those things and says hey you know where
[41:34] you're at you know who you are you're a
[41:36] son or daughter of God you belong to God
[41:39] and and we just need to take that step
[41:41] up and and take a look at the big
[41:43] picture for a minute and realize we
[41:45] belong to God Amen nothing the devil
[41:48] could do to take us out of who we are
[41:50] amen amen we're on the rock of
[41:52] revelation of the word amen amen
[41:55] Revelation 6 7 thank you for being here
[41:57] tonight when it opened the fourth seal
[42:00] I heard the voice of the fourth Beast
[42:03] say come and see
[42:05] and I looked and behold a Pale Horse
[42:08] and his name that said on him was death
[42:13] and the Hell Followed With Him and power
[42:15] was given unto them over the fourth part
[42:18] of the Earth
[42:19] a kill was sword and with Hunger with
[42:22] death
[42:23] and with Beasts of the Earth
[42:25] let's bow our heads together for a word
[42:27] of prayer I wonder if you've got a
[42:29] special need you'd like to make known or
[42:31] wave uplifted a hand God sees each and
[42:33] every one of those needs Heavenly Father
[42:36] Lord Jesus we're so thankful for your
[42:38] comforting presence we feel here tonight
[42:41] or no matter what we've been through
[42:43] during the week or what we've done Lord
[42:46] we can add our voice to the song I'm not
[42:48] giving up because we know Lord that you
[42:52] will not give up on us we thank you for
[42:54] that Lord Lord we can do all things
[42:57] through you who strengthens us and so we
[43:00] come boldly tonight or believing that
[43:03] you will give Revelation it will give
[43:05] strength Lord whatever these needs are
[43:07] that were represented by an uplifted man
[43:09] or whatever needs of those many that are
[43:12] watching tonight I pray God that you'd
[43:14] bless them Lord go into every home not
[43:17] just tonight Lord but every night
[43:18] through the week I pray that your Holy
[43:21] Spirit would would settle down over the
[43:23] homes every place where the token is
[43:25] applied Lord May there be a strength
[43:27] that would come up a victory Lord that
[43:30] we would know Lord we may be still
[43:32] fighting the battle but we know we have
[43:34] the victory because you're on our side I
[43:36] pray you granted Lord we love you we
[43:39] thank you for your presence we pray you
[43:41] bless these people in Jesus name amen
[43:44] God bless you can be seated
[43:48] finally come to the last of the Four
[43:50] Horses The Pale Horse
[43:52] the living creature that showed John
[43:54] this seal was the eagle represented the
[43:57] prophet
[43:58] this is where we are looking at the end
[44:01] of all things I I remember as we're
[44:04] approaching this seal now we we're not
[44:07] uh we're approaching some things that
[44:09] are in the future and I as we begin to
[44:12] look at these things it's like traveling
[44:14] out west if you've ever been on a
[44:16] highway at night as you're going you
[44:19] come up like coming to El Paso or a city
[44:21] like that and you'll come up over a hill
[44:23] and you'll look and you'll see the whole
[44:24] city out in front of you and you haven't
[44:26] reached it yet in fact it may be 30
[44:28] minutes away but you can see it it's
[44:31] there and that's where we are some of
[44:33] these things haven't taken place yet as
[44:36] far as as far as the Antichrist becoming
[44:38] who he is and taking the heart of obese
[44:41] some of the things you'll you'll hear
[44:43] Brother random talk about tonight you'll
[44:44] see uh in the words on the screen some
[44:47] of those things are yet in the future
[44:49] but we see it but we don't have to be
[44:51] scared of it because we know that we'll
[44:54] never reach that place
[44:56] we're going home amen so we can see the
[45:00] end of all things we can see things
[45:02] taking place all around us but we're
[45:05] caught up don't ever lose sight of this
[45:07] we're not caught up in the fourth steel
[45:09] we're not caught up in the Sixth Seal or
[45:12] the fifth seal we're caught up in the
[45:13] mystery of going which is the seven seal
[45:16] the mystery of the seventh seal we're
[45:18] caught up in that and the revelation of
[45:20] that and we need to remember that as we
[45:22] approach these things now this writer or
[45:26] this horse he said come and the living
[45:28] creature said come and see the fourth
[45:30] mystery the book of redemption that's
[45:32] been hidden in this book and John went
[45:34] to see and he saw a Pale Horse and
[45:37] he said again the same writer upon this
[45:39] Pale Horse
[45:40] now he has a name called Death
[45:43] he said now notice none of the other
[45:45] horses no no time that this rider ever
[45:48] rode they didn't have a name but this
[45:51] one had a name
[45:52] he had been identified now he's called
[45:54] Death
[45:55] what he had he been identified by by the
[45:58] eagle
[45:59] right he's been exposed
[46:02] who he is remember in the first field
[46:04] they thought well that could be the
[46:06] church that could be something else and
[46:08] the second seal kind of began to see who
[46:10] he was but they still thought well it
[46:12] could be something else but this one no
[46:14] one thinks this one is good right this
[46:17] is death
[46:18] why because it's been exposed by the
[46:21] eagle anointing now he's called Death
[46:24] he's not aren't you glad for the message
[46:25] of the day it exposes death so we don't
[46:29] have to die
[46:30] amen so now I again it's not revealed
[46:34] under the lion anointing or the ox
[46:36] anointing or the man anointing but it's
[46:38] revealed under the eagle anointing he
[46:40] said but in the eagle age the last age
[46:42] the prophetic age where there is to rise
[46:44] prophetic utterancy to whom the secrets
[46:47] always come now if you go back and read
[46:50] the fourth seal and as you begin to
[46:52] listen to it you'll find other random
[46:53] lingers for some time during that seal
[46:56] on Elijah Ministry and the need for the
[46:59] Elijah Ministry and the promise
[47:01] of the Elijah Ministry now I will say
[47:04] this Elijah has come and gone and they
[47:07] did to him what they were supposed to
[47:08] and we don't need another Elijah
[47:11] Elijah's come the word has been
[47:13] introduced and taken the preeminence
[47:15] Among Us and I'm so glad he come and
[47:17] said Behold the Lamb of God who's taken
[47:19] away the sin of the world he's been here
[47:21] and gone he's done his part and now it's
[47:23] time to do our part
[47:25] but but he he comes down on that really
[47:28] hard so the people could see so we could
[47:30] see
[47:32] so he goes on he said God always Likens
[47:34] His prophets to Eagles he calls himself
[47:36] an eagle the eagle goes so high there
[47:39] ain't nothing else can touch him not
[47:40] only is he up there but he's built for
[47:43] that position when he gets up there he
[47:45] can see where he's at see he said a crow
[47:47] couldn't follow him he'd he'd explode or
[47:50] implode up there he's not pressurized to
[47:53] fit it but aren't you glad he didn't
[47:54] just call him to be an eagle but he
[47:56] called Eagles to go with him up there
[47:58] because wherever the carcass is the
[48:00] Eagles plural are gathered together
[48:04] so he can see where he's at now uh here
[48:06] Here Comes death rioting he said he was
[48:10] natural both natural and spiritual death
[48:12] in the natural 68 million natural deaths
[48:15] billions
[48:16] of spiritual deaths
[48:18] he he said in this fourth horse he said
[48:21] the first one was white and then the
[48:22] next one was red and the next one was
[48:24] black the fourth one all of these other
[48:26] three was represented in it because pale
[48:29] is red and white and so mixed together
[48:31] so he's all three horses mixed together
[48:35] so in the Antichrist Remember come uh in
[48:39] four stages it was three and one uh just
[48:41] like just like God is he remember he
[48:44] copies everything God does and so he
[48:46] first come and say Antichrist white
[48:48] second false prophet read the third the
[48:50] vicar of heavens and earth and Purgatory
[48:52] black and forth the Beast Pale Horse
[48:55] which is really just the three and one
[48:57] but it's him becoming incarnate Satan
[49:00] being kicked out of heaven he said and
[49:02] you find that in Revelation 12 13 we
[49:04] won't go to Revelation 12. uh but you
[49:07] you can go read that when you get home
[49:08] Satan being kicked out of heaven and
[49:11] then in Revelation 13 1 brother says one
[49:14] and eight I think is the way he says
[49:16] that whenever brother Brandon says
[49:17] Revelation 13 1-8 or Revelation 10 1-7
[49:20] uh he's saying one through seven
[49:23] in one place he says inclusive but
[49:26] that's what he says they put a comma
[49:28] there but actually I think it should be
[49:29] a dash because it's one through eight
[49:31] where he's incarnate in the person of
[49:33] the beast in verse 8 it tells us that
[49:35] all that dwell upon the Earth shall
[49:37] worship Him whose aims were not written
[49:39] in the Book of Life of the lamb slain
[49:42] from the foundation of the world what
[49:43] does that mean it means we won't worship
[49:45] him because our names are written in the
[49:48] Book of Life
[49:50] so he said we find out here this Satan
[49:52] after being kicked out of heaven
[49:54] incarnates himself in the Beast and now
[49:57] he's a beast Antichrist false prophet
[49:59] and now Beast been given the name of
[50:01] death and Hell follows him fully Satan
[50:04] on his throne he said now this happens
[50:07] later on now watch a prophet places this
[50:10] he said he is false prophet now he will
[50:13] become Beast after a while when he
[50:15] breaks his Covenant with the Jews so we
[50:17] know the moment when he becomes the
[50:19] Beast is when he breaks the Covenant in
[50:21] the midst of the three and a half years
[50:22] he said here he is sitting here with
[50:25] this beastly heart in him now here's the
[50:27] other person the Beast the Incarnate
[50:29] devil he said watch he rides a pale
[50:31] horse as he appears on his ride this
[50:34] last ride he said he's on his last now
[50:37] now now and if you watch the way but
[50:39] remember the seals and all like the
[50:41] church ages right there's not a definite
[50:43] starting date and a definite ending day
[50:45] but it Blends even the church ages blend
[50:48] but the seals more so because the first
[50:50] four seals cover it all and then you go
[50:53] back in the fifth and sixth and seventh
[50:55] now
[50:55] and run concurrently now if you don't
[50:58] understand that we're going to slow down
[51:00] when we get to the seventh seal and go
[51:03] over some of these things now he said
[51:06] it's he said it's on its last now so
[51:08] he's on his last tribe he said but that
[51:10] is not in our day what is done in our
[51:12] day the Beast is becoming incarnate he
[51:14] said that will be on down it's Cecile
[51:16] foretold he said because see the church
[51:18] has done gone up when this happens
[51:21] so the eagle showed us what is coming
[51:25] right and I can dwell on that for a
[51:28] while Church don't be afraid of what's
[51:30] coming
[51:31] you you can't be afraid of politics
[51:33] because if you if you fear that if you
[51:35] spend all your time on that you're
[51:37] saying that you doubt whether or not
[51:39] you're going up
[51:40] but a prophet if he's if he's right
[51:43] about anything he's right about this
[51:45] right we're going up before that
[51:48] so we should not live our life in fear
[51:50] of an antichrist system controlling the
[51:52] Earth because we're going home
[51:55] hey man yet he is in control today but
[51:59] he's going to become incarnate it's
[52:00] going to get a lot worse
[52:03] right for the world
[52:05] it's going to become a time when you
[52:07] don't want to live here it was hard
[52:08] enough to live through covert wasn't it
[52:10] that was a difficult time to live on the
[52:13] earth some of us are if the Lord tarries
[52:15] we're going to tell our grandchildren
[52:17] but bless God I made it through coven
[52:19] what did you go through
[52:21] huh
[52:22] it was it was a terrible time
[52:25] it was a it was people went crazy but
[52:29] there's much worse coming
[52:31] much worse coming but on the earth and
[52:34] there'll be much more control and much
[52:36] more things that will happen on the
[52:38] earth that's coming down the road but
[52:40] we're going home before that happens
[52:43] we may see different things come and let
[52:45] cover different things that will come
[52:47] that'll show us some of those things
[52:48] that are coming because he's on his last
[52:50] drive but before that happens we go home
[52:53] so this fellow appears and becomes
[52:55] completely the devil from Antichrist all
[52:58] the way down through false prophet and
[53:00] into the Beast the Devil Himself I'll
[53:02] say this if you're if you find yourself
[53:04] always fussing and fighting with other
[53:06] believers
[53:09] there's something big coming
[53:11] we need to look at the big picture
[53:14] right not spend all of our time worried
[53:16] about somebody that offended us need to
[53:19] look at the big picture there's a
[53:21] there's some problems coming down the
[53:23] road I just want to make sure that I
[53:25] make it in Brother David I just want to
[53:27] make sure that whether I go by way of
[53:28] the Grave or go by way of the Rapture
[53:30] that I'm ready at that time
[53:32] ready to go home
[53:34] so he's he's riding he's riding on a
[53:38] Pale Horse colored all up mixed with all
[53:40] kinds can't you see him coming mixed up
[53:43] just a mixture of everything all sorts
[53:46] of powers all controlled by one person
[53:49] to make him pale and deathly he said but
[53:52] when our Lord appears here on Earth
[53:53] he'll be riding on a Snow White Horse
[53:56] he'll be completely fully Emmanuel the
[54:00] word of God incarnate in a man
[54:02] a horse is a beast that represents a
[54:06] power his power is all mixed up why it's
[54:08] politics
[54:09] National Powers it's religious Powers
[54:12] it's demon powers
[54:14] all kinds of powers mixed together
[54:16] see he declared himself King over
[54:18] Purgatory but actually what he is is
[54:20] king of devils
[54:22] the king of demons
[54:24] a mixed Pale Horse he said he got all
[54:26] kinds of powers when Jesus comes it's
[54:29] not on a mixed horse it's one solid
[54:32] color horse the word
[54:34] hey man he said three powers United
[54:36] together see all mixed up in a color
[54:38] pale death spoke in the whole thing
[54:41] political religious and demon powers
[54:44] mixed together
[54:46] listen we don't go home on political
[54:48] powers
[54:49] we don't go home on demon powers
[54:52] we're not going to defeat the enemy with
[54:54] religious powers
[54:56] having the bigger church or the bigger
[54:58] well we're not going home on that we're
[55:00] not going home on the politics of the
[55:02] world we're not going home on those
[55:03] things we're going home on the word
[55:05] keep your mind focused on the word keep
[55:08] your eyes on the word that's how we're
[55:10] going home
[55:12] hey man you said so politics he's the
[55:15] king of politics Satan is he said smart
[55:18] sure don't try to outwit him
[55:21] yeah amen just trust the Lord
[55:24] that's all right he said the fourth
[55:26] stage of this writer is called death
[55:28] death means Eternal separation from God
[55:32] that's what death means to be eternally
[55:34] separated from God now he explains to us
[55:37] that Saints sleep they don't die
[55:40] remember Jesus told him he said she's
[55:42] only sleeping they said well she's dead
[55:45] but she's only sleeping Saints sleep
[55:47] they don't die you have eternal life
[55:50] brother Brandon said the kind of life
[55:51] that the flowers have is Perpetual life
[55:54] things that are to be said that's
[55:55] Perpetual life they go down in the fall
[55:58] and they come back up in the spring you
[56:00] don't have Perpetual life you have
[56:02] eternal life why because there's a part
[56:04] of you that never dies
[56:06] and let me tell you this it was never
[56:07] born
[56:08] it always was there's a part of you that
[56:11] was eternal before the oh my well how
[56:13] can it be defeated how can it not go
[56:15] back where it came from because it's a
[56:18] part of you that come from God going
[56:19] back to God
[56:22] amen
[56:23] so Saints sleep they don't die and he
[56:27] said now remember this Antichrist
[56:29] himself being the man his bride now see
[56:32] he's got a bride which is his church was
[56:35] given us space to repent
[56:37] and she did not do it
[56:39] and that church hates that tyrant
[56:42] so let's go back a little bit because
[56:44] now during the time of this black horse
[56:47] rider
[56:48] Catholic Church
[56:50] we know them today was given a space to
[56:52] repent
[56:54] and they were given that space to repent
[56:56] under that church age in the dietary
[56:59] Church age they were given a space to
[57:01] repent under the message of Luther and
[57:03] others who came out and at reformers who
[57:06] came out and exposed to church
[57:09] gave them a space to repent God gave
[57:11] them a chance
[57:13] and they didn't do it
[57:14] of course he knew she wouldn't do it
[57:17] Revelation 2 20 he said notwithstanding
[57:19] of a few things against Faith because
[57:21] our sufferers that woman Jezebel which
[57:24] calleth herself a prophetess to teach
[57:26] and to seduce my servants to commit
[57:28] fornication to eat things sacrificed
[57:30] into idols and I gave her space
[57:33] I gave her space to repent of her
[57:35] fornication and she repented not
[57:38] behold I will cast her into a bed and
[57:41] then the commit adultery with her into
[57:43] Great Tribulation except they repent of
[57:45] their deeds
[57:47] I will kill her children with death now
[57:50] watch so this this Jezebel has children
[57:53] see there's a mother Harlot and there's
[57:55] daughters right in the Book of
[57:57] Revelation so this Jezebel has children
[57:59] he said I'm going to kill her children
[58:00] with death that's a strange wording
[58:03] isn't it I'll kill him with this with
[58:05] what spiritual death
[58:07] I'll kill her children with death and
[58:09] all the churches shall know that I am he
[58:12] would search us the Reigns and the
[58:13] hearts and I will give unto every one of
[58:15] you according to your Works he said I
[58:17] will kill them with death he said if
[58:19] they're killed they're eternally
[58:20] separated he said remember he gave her a
[58:23] space to repent Arian age was the Dark
[58:25] Age the dark horse rider wrote in that
[58:27] time when all the masses and everything
[58:29] had to be paid for the prayers the
[58:31] novenas and so forth now see his black
[58:33] horse after he refused to repent and thy
[58:35] attire changes his writing from a black
[58:38] horse to a pale one death for his last
[58:40] Ministry so he's not fully Beast yet but
[58:44] he's already changing over
[58:46] onto this Pale Horse Ride Now
[58:50] brother Branham goes on if you go into
[58:52] the fourth steel and talks about that
[58:53] individual rejecture he said let me
[58:55] shake you for a minute
[58:56] if you reject one day he said you'll
[58:58] reject God for the last time
[59:00] listen to me tonight church I know we're
[59:02] mostly Christians sitting here tonight
[59:04] but if you're if you're a person that
[59:07] has turned down the voice of the holy
[59:09] spirit in your life maybe conviction
[59:11] over something or another you you need
[59:13] to follow the word you need to do what
[59:16] God says you need to believe God you
[59:19] need to just just repent you might as
[59:21] well just let it go because he's going
[59:22] to get you one way or another but you
[59:24] might as well just repent because one
[59:26] day it'll be the last chance
[59:28] he's given us a space to repent while
[59:31] Mercy is on the throne while there's
[59:33] time to repent I don't care what you've
[59:34] done Now's the Time to repent don't
[59:36] leave little things between you and God
[59:38] don't leave little things between you
[59:40] and your wife don't leave little things
[59:42] between you and your husband don't leave
[59:44] little things between you and other
[59:45] people in the church no no don't let it
[59:47] sit there little unforgiveness and
[59:49] bitterness this is the hour when the
[59:51] bride is called it was a Zeal to repent
[59:54] do you believe that tonight
[59:57] amen for the individual rejects just
[1:00:00] like the church did but that church
[1:00:02] rejected him all the way back in that
[1:00:04] early Reformation h
[1:00:07] uh so he said see the loving
[1:00:08] long-suffering of God before he passed
[1:00:11] judgment upon her he gave her a place to
[1:00:14] repent
[1:00:15] a place to repent oh my and it's in the
[1:00:18] name of the Lord I say this he has give
[1:00:21] the Protestant Church the same thing
[1:00:24] now this just happened lately
[1:00:27] right 1956 he said America got her last
[1:00:30] chance
[1:00:32] right but it just happened where he gave
[1:00:34] the Protestant Church the same thing and
[1:00:36] she won't do it
[1:00:37] he said the message that shook
[1:00:39] everywhere you realize this message was
[1:00:41] bigger than just us
[1:00:43] right this message was for a reason
[1:00:45] sometimes you look at the message you
[1:00:47] begin to think look at all the things
[1:00:48] brother saying why is he even saying
[1:00:49] that well he's not just preaching to us
[1:00:52] is preaching to us but not only to us he
[1:00:56] also gave us space
[1:00:58] oh my for the Protestant church to
[1:01:01] repent
[1:01:02] right that's what he was doing that's
[1:01:05] what God was doing through the ministry
[1:01:06] of a prophet
[1:01:08] he said she's going to have her own
[1:01:10] dogmas and Creeds I don't care how much
[1:01:11] you explain it you talked about the last
[1:01:13] plague that was in Egypt was death he
[1:01:15] said that's the last plague that's hit
[1:01:17] the Pentecostal Church his spiritual
[1:01:18] death she's dead he said that's in the
[1:01:21] name of the Lord she is spiritually dead
[1:01:23] he gave her a place to repent and she
[1:01:25] rejected it now she is dead she'll never
[1:01:29] rise again he said the sleeping virgin
[1:01:30] would not get the oil
[1:01:32] right remember when they showed back up
[1:01:34] the door was already shut
[1:01:36] they'd have to go through tribulation
[1:01:38] period even even the Virgin had to go
[1:01:40] through tribulation period to be
[1:01:42] purified but we go home
[1:01:44] are you with me so far
[1:01:47] now
[1:01:48] this is an important principle
[1:01:51] her rejection makes the perfect way for
[1:01:54] Satan to come into her and be incarnate
[1:01:59] so it's the principle of if you reject
[1:02:02] the Holy Spirit
[1:02:03] then
[1:02:05] then something worse will come on you
[1:02:08] if you disbelieve God something worse
[1:02:10] will come on you
[1:02:12] actually becomes incarnate he said
[1:02:14] that's exactly the same thing that the
[1:02:16] Protestant church becomes a harlot is
[1:02:20] because she rejects the Vindicated truth
[1:02:22] of the word of God and that gives the
[1:02:24] devil a place to come right in and
[1:02:26] incarnate himself
[1:02:27] and he'll make an image unto the beast
[1:02:29] when they consolidate them together
[1:02:31] right right Yonder now going just
[1:02:32] exactly what he said he said see how
[1:02:34] long-suffering aren't you glad you serve
[1:02:36] a good god a god with long suffering
[1:02:39] what a wonderful you realize how long he
[1:02:41] worked with that Protestant church
[1:02:43] he worked with her all from the time of
[1:02:45] Luther he worked first with the Catholic
[1:02:47] church for all of those years and then
[1:02:50] he worked with the Protestant church for
[1:02:52] all of those years trying warning them
[1:02:54] trying to give them a space to repent
[1:02:57] all through the powers of the message
[1:02:59] you give them a space to repent
[1:03:01] but she turned it down
[1:03:03] oh my I'm so glad the bride got
[1:03:05] something inside of her that she will
[1:03:07] repent and she will turn to God she will
[1:03:10] be in a state of Revival I believe that
[1:03:13] at the end time not a state of emotional
[1:03:15] Revival not a state of intellectual
[1:03:17] Revival but a word Revival
[1:03:19] there'll be something in her longing for
[1:03:21] the word of God
[1:03:23] oh my
[1:03:25] look
[1:03:28] where did she fall from he said
[1:03:31] oh look let me back up he said see a
[1:03:32] long-suffering what a wonderful love
[1:03:34] there's no love like that look at those
[1:03:36] even spit on his face and things he
[1:03:38] forgave them he said that's God
[1:03:40] look he said she was asked to repent go
[1:03:42] back to where she fell from now where
[1:03:45] did she fall from from the original word
[1:03:47] of the apostolic Apostles and Prophets
[1:03:50] that's where she failed from that's
[1:03:52] where the Protestant fell from
[1:03:54] right now look repent he said go back
[1:03:58] turn back before it's too late you see
[1:04:00] the heart of a prophet he's preaching to
[1:04:03] that Protestant church
[1:04:04] he said he said one of these days that
[1:04:06] lamb will leave his place then it's all
[1:04:08] over so it's her daughter's been asked
[1:04:10] now he said before being judged with her
[1:04:12] to return back then what did they do
[1:04:15] they finally form up in the image unto
[1:04:17] the Beast another Power notice an act of
[1:04:19] the Lamb's bride like she did in
[1:04:21] Revelation 13 14. you realize what we're
[1:04:23] doing the message has to get out
[1:04:26] it gets out to get the last one true but
[1:04:29] also has to get out because it's the
[1:04:31] last warning to the church
[1:04:36] and so Revelation 13 14 so he now watch
[1:04:40] he says they finally form up an image to
[1:04:43] the Beast so the Protestant Church
[1:04:45] treats the bride
[1:04:47] he said like Revelation 13 14.
[1:04:50] where he says he deceiveth him that
[1:04:52] dwell in the Earth but the means of
[1:04:53] those Miracles which he had power to do
[1:04:55] in the sight of the Beast saying to them
[1:04:57] that dwell on the earth that they should
[1:04:59] make an image to the beast that's how he
[1:05:00] treats her he's pushing her saying to
[1:05:02] her you should make an image to the
[1:05:03] Beast you should you should all get
[1:05:05] along you should accept the Trinity
[1:05:07] Doctrine you you should just be like
[1:05:09] everybody else
[1:05:10] right that's how he treats the bride
[1:05:13] saying to them that dwell on the earth
[1:05:14] they should make an image to the Beast
[1:05:15] which had the wound by a sword and did
[1:05:17] lift
[1:05:18] so death followed this writer Hell
[1:05:21] Followed this Rider Revelation 6 8 he
[1:05:24] said I saw Pale Horse pale horse's name
[1:05:27] that said on him was death and Hell
[1:05:28] Followed With Him He said now hell
[1:05:30] always follows death in the natural he
[1:05:33] said when the natural man dies hell
[1:05:34] follows him that's the grave Hades see
[1:05:37] in the natural you exhibit in the
[1:05:39] spiritual so Lake of Fire he said all
[1:05:41] right into Eternal separation where
[1:05:43] they're burnt up I want to say this and
[1:05:45] maybe we'll take it sometime as a
[1:05:47] thought but I've had this thought lately
[1:05:49] you know you have to bury your past
[1:05:52] there's a reason for that
[1:05:54] you have to bury your past and the
[1:05:56] reason we bury our past is because you
[1:05:58] can't let your past rule your future
[1:06:01] right but there's also a truth in your
[1:06:03] past that your past when buried it
[1:06:07] actually can become
[1:06:08] fertilizer if I could say it that way
[1:06:10] for your future
[1:06:13] right the seeds got to go on the ground
[1:06:15] and die and rock but when it rots and it
[1:06:18] loses its form and and it just becomes
[1:06:20] dead then what happens it actually
[1:06:22] becomes fertilizer so not you don't go
[1:06:24] through anything without a purpose
[1:06:27] everything you go through is part of the
[1:06:29] dirt
[1:06:31] right that makes the seed grow
[1:06:34] yeah think about it for a minute
[1:06:37] the seed has to rot so so it has to go
[1:06:41] through Grace So hell Hades follows
[1:06:43] death
[1:06:45] but in the spiritual it's the Lake of
[1:06:47] Fire
[1:06:47] exit into Eternal separation where
[1:06:49] they're burnt up
[1:06:50] he said look what this is all coming to
[1:06:52] what is it it's going right back the way
[1:06:54] it did he said it started in heaven it's
[1:06:56] coming to the End Time battle watch see
[1:06:58] how this Force feels wrapping everything
[1:07:00] up
[1:07:01] he said no the battle started in heaven
[1:07:02] it'll be finished on Earth in the form
[1:07:04] of Armageddon
[1:07:05] Antichrist refuses the true bride
[1:07:08] Doctrine and therefore he takes his own
[1:07:10] bride now builds her up under a Creed of
[1:07:12] his own takes his own bride makes for a
[1:07:13] denomination she gives gives birth to
[1:07:16] other denominations
[1:07:17] he said as quoted in the Holy scriptures
[1:07:19] gives birth to daughters and she becomes
[1:07:21] just like her mother natural worldly
[1:07:23] denominational opposing the spiritual
[1:07:26] bride the word he talks about Esau and
[1:07:28] Jacob he said he's Gathering them
[1:07:30] together on his mixed colored horse
[1:07:33] because he's got political power
[1:07:34] remember I already got the politics but
[1:07:38] he gathers his religious power and his
[1:07:40] demonic power he pulls them all together
[1:07:42] and he writes
[1:07:45] so they are gathered by that now I love
[1:07:48] this they are gathered by literally
[1:07:52] gathered by false Doctrine two
[1:07:54] Armageddon
[1:07:56] their commonality is a trinity Doctrine
[1:07:59] that gathers him to Armageddon but we'll
[1:08:02] prove it by the scriptures Revelation 16
[1:08:04] 13. he said I saw three unclean spirits
[1:08:07] like frogs come out of the mouth of the
[1:08:09] dragon out of the mouth of the Beast and
[1:08:11] out of the mouth of the false prophet
[1:08:12] but they are the spirits of devils
[1:08:14] working miracles which go forth unto the
[1:08:16] kings of the earth and of the whole
[1:08:17] world to gather them
[1:08:19] what is it the three unclean spirits
[1:08:21] like frogs the Trinity Doctrine
[1:08:23] to gather them into the Battle of that
[1:08:26] great day of God almighty they're
[1:08:29] gathered by false word to the battle of
[1:08:32] Armageddon
[1:08:33] he said now watch where he gathers them
[1:08:35] from the four corners of the earth
[1:08:37] they're Gathering now I I know maybe he
[1:08:40] said brother Ben it's just it doesn't
[1:08:41] interest me maybe it should
[1:08:45] I'm not condemning you for being tired
[1:08:46] that's that's the way we are you know on
[1:08:49] Wednesday night I've got service the
[1:08:51] next Thursday night Friday night
[1:08:53] Saturday morning or Saturday they're
[1:08:54] doing something special at the church up
[1:08:56] there tomorrow night and then the
[1:08:58] meeting's coming up and and we got all
[1:09:00] that going on and but you know what we
[1:09:02] need to just take a step aside
[1:09:04] and let us let our Spirits be lifted up
[1:09:06] for a moment
[1:09:08] because we're being gathered by
[1:09:10] something yeah
[1:09:11] or either being gathered by this or by
[1:09:13] demonic power
[1:09:16] oh I want to be gathered to the word
[1:09:17] don't you
[1:09:19] so they were gathering now for The
[1:09:20] Showdown The Showdown will be at
[1:09:21] Armageddon according to the word
[1:09:23] he said now here they are joining
[1:09:25] themselves together coming to that
[1:09:26] Showdown to Armageddon riding on a mixed
[1:09:28] colored horse one horse of white one
[1:09:30] horse of red one horse of black three
[1:09:32] different political Powers spiritual
[1:09:33] power controlled by demon power which is
[1:09:36] the Antichrist mixing that all together
[1:09:38] you got a pale sickly looking thing he's
[1:09:40] riding on look what he's writing on this
[1:09:42] pale looking grizzled colored horse
[1:09:43] mixed with black red and white coming to
[1:09:45] the battle Gathering his subjects from
[1:09:47] every nation under Heaven he said did
[1:09:49] not Daniel interpret the dream seen that
[1:09:51] streak of iron run into every Kingdom of
[1:09:53] Rome remember the toes where we're a
[1:09:56] mixture of iron and clay
[1:09:58] right that iron that Roman system run
[1:10:00] into every Kingdom
[1:10:02] now I hate to burst your bubble but that
[1:10:04] iron that runs into every Kingdom we're
[1:10:06] part of that as a nation
[1:10:09] right he got politics
[1:10:11] don't get wrapped up in politics he's
[1:10:13] already got that
[1:10:15] he said now here they come Gathering
[1:10:17] they're gathering in now to do
[1:10:19] oh my
[1:10:21] God bringing his subjects from the four
[1:10:23] corners of the earth riding a pale
[1:10:25] sickly three-colored mixed horse same
[1:10:28] man
[1:10:29] but he's not the only one doing the
[1:10:31] Gathering
[1:10:32] he said in Revelation 19 not only is he
[1:10:34] getting ready but Christ is getting
[1:10:36] ready to meet him
[1:10:38] he said the battle is going to be hot
[1:10:39] and heavy
[1:10:41] Christ is gathered his not from the four
[1:10:43] corners of the Earth because there's
[1:10:45] going to be a little bitty remnant
[1:10:47] what's he doing he's Gathering them from
[1:10:49] the four corners of Heaven
[1:10:52] now think about it the bride will not
[1:10:54] represent a large number of the people
[1:10:56] on the Earth
[1:10:58] but there's a large number with him
[1:11:00] right and but what what does that large
[1:11:02] number come from from the four corners
[1:11:04] of Heaven when he comes back after the
[1:11:06] marriage suffered what what who is this
[1:11:09] with him he's gathered them from the
[1:11:11] four corners of Heaven amen he said he
[1:11:14] also has a name not death so he look
[1:11:17] listen death was identified in our day
[1:11:19] how many know that
[1:11:20] guess what's identified in our day but
[1:11:22] life was also identified by the same
[1:11:25] message
[1:11:26] had the same Prophet life was identified
[1:11:29] and we've got to recognize that today no
[1:11:31] matter what you're going through no
[1:11:32] matter what's happened around you no
[1:11:34] matter what's going on I know I know
[1:11:36] it's hard to look away sometimes but we
[1:11:38] need to recognize the word that we have
[1:11:40] life has been exposed in our day just
[1:11:43] like death has been exposed
[1:11:46] he said he said now he said he also has
[1:11:49] a name not death but the word of God
[1:11:50] life amen God wrote right on his thigh
[1:11:53] the word of God he said that's the only
[1:11:54] life because God is the only source of
[1:11:57] eternal life there is
[1:11:58] Zoe he's got wrote life amen so what is
[1:12:02] the word life
[1:12:04] hey man it's a Living Word not a dead
[1:12:06] letter A Living Word
[1:12:07] he said he's got wrote Life riding on a
[1:12:10] white horse and here is a man with three
[1:12:12] different powers mixed up Called Death
[1:12:14] Gathering his Earthbound delegates and
[1:12:17] Christ is gathering his heaven-born
[1:12:19] subjects
[1:12:20] faith those with him are on white horses
[1:12:23] also they are the they're called listen
[1:12:26] the chosen before the foundation of the
[1:12:29] world he said amen and they are faithful
[1:12:31] to the word
[1:12:33] called chosen before the foundation of
[1:12:36] the world now watch called
[1:12:39] before the foundation of the world

[1:12:42] world and then faithful to the word by
[1:12:45] their choosing yes
[1:12:48] yeah
[1:12:50] see you can't help but be called
[1:12:53] you you had nothing to do with you being
[1:12:56] caught
[1:12:57] but you do have something to do with
[1:12:59] being faithful
[1:13:00] that's what a prophet taught us
[1:13:02] you you're faithful to the word I'm so
[1:13:05] glad that God has brought a faithful
[1:13:06] little group together in Hardy Arkansas
[1:13:08] and other places even around here many
[1:13:11] places many churches that represent of
[1:13:14] faithful people that are faithful to the
[1:13:16] word not faithful to a pastor not
[1:13:18] faithful to a church although that's
[1:13:20] good but faithful to the word
[1:13:22] by their choosing
[1:13:25] glory to God oh see you get to choose
[1:13:28] whether to come to church
[1:13:30] you get to choose whether to serve God
[1:13:32] that's the truth we're a free world
[1:13:34] agent but we didn't choose whether to be
[1:13:35] called we didn't choose whether to be
[1:13:38] elect
[1:13:39] we were already at the elect but we got
[1:13:40] to choose to be faithful
[1:13:43] amen all he said all stimulated
[1:13:47] look at this group that's riding with
[1:13:48] him
[1:13:49] he said they're chosen they're faithful
[1:13:51] and they're stimulated with new wine and
[1:13:54] oil just riding Right Along coming down
[1:13:56] to meet him he said here we see life and
[1:13:58] death coming to the final struggle the
[1:14:01] White Horse of True Life The Pale Horse
[1:14:03] of mixed Creed he said white was the
[1:14:05] only original color
[1:14:06] he said and when if he is the White
[1:14:08] Horse and he is the word then to mix
[1:14:10] anything with that any kind of creed add
[1:14:12] one word to it take one word from it is
[1:14:14] to pervert the whole thing
[1:14:15] truth and error cannot mix how many know
[1:14:17] that tonight it cannot mix it's either
[1:14:19] thus saith the Lord or it's wrong
[1:14:23] let me tell you somebody says the Lord
[1:14:24] said it better be the Lord said
[1:14:27] it's either thus saith the Lord or it's
[1:14:29] wrong
[1:14:29] no matter what Holy Father said it Saint
[1:14:32] bonifer the Archbishop of Canterbury he
[1:14:34] said I don't know who said it if it's
[1:14:35] contrary to the word is perversion it
[1:14:38] won't mix he said why this fellow done I
[1:14:40] don't care what he done how much holy he
[1:14:42] is anything like that this is the only
[1:14:44] he said this is the only direct truth
[1:14:47] that we have
[1:14:51] huh
[1:14:52] no church
[1:14:53] no Creed has no truth
[1:14:57] if it's outside of this
[1:14:59] how do you know he's holding up his
[1:15:01] Bible because he many times did that I
[1:15:03] said this is the only truth that we have
[1:15:05] how is this battle going to go
[1:15:08] yeah you want to know how it's going to
[1:15:09] go
[1:15:10] he told us he said it's going to go like
[1:15:12] this John Jesus Promised John 11 25
[1:15:15] Jesus said unto her I am the
[1:15:17] resurrection and the life
[1:15:19] he that believeth in me though that he
[1:15:21] were dead yet shall he live whosoever
[1:15:24] liveth and believeth in me shall never
[1:15:25] die but leave us now this
[1:15:27] amen and of course that scripture and he
[1:15:30] said Here Comes Satan with all four
[1:15:32] corners of the Earth with his
[1:15:34] Protestants with his Catholics all
[1:15:35] together marching right up to the battle
[1:15:37] of Armageddon and here comes Jesus
[1:15:40] coming down from heaven
[1:15:42] with resurrected Saints
[1:15:45] Vindicated word
[1:15:48] I love this
[1:15:52] somehow with Harvey I'd forgotten this
[1:15:54] or I missed it or something
[1:15:56] but we will vindicate
[1:15:58] him
[1:16:00] at his third coming
[1:16:03] who do you think vindicates him now
[1:16:06] think about it for a minute you
[1:16:08] vindicate the word
[1:16:10] by being raised from dead trespasses
[1:16:14] oh my you realize what you're doing
[1:16:17] you realize what you're doing but the
[1:16:19] Journey about living the gospel in your
[1:16:21] day you you actually vindicate the word
[1:16:25] of God
[1:16:26] you vindicate the word by being raised
[1:16:29] by being quickened by being filled with
[1:16:32] the Holy Spirit in our day
[1:16:34] you Vindicated me so I don't feel much
[1:16:36] like a Vindication I got struggles I
[1:16:38] sometimes have a hard time staying awake
[1:16:39] in church but you're a Vindication
[1:16:41] because you were dead once and you're
[1:16:43] alive today
[1:16:45] hey man you were you were dead and lost
[1:16:47] in in sins and trespasses you were you
[1:16:50] were without God you were ungodly you
[1:16:52] drank and smoked and carried on or you
[1:16:54] had a religious spirit on you but one
[1:16:55] day you came to life for the daddy and
[1:16:57] when you come to life you Vindicated the
[1:16:59] word of the hour what Vindication do we
[1:17:01] need of the message of the hour it's you
[1:17:05] amen
[1:17:06] you are his vindication
[1:17:09] Here Comes Jesus from heaven with
[1:17:12] resurrected Saints Vindicated word
[1:17:15] he said notice you want to know how the
[1:17:16] battle is going to go you come with
[1:17:18] resurrected Saints vindicating that his
[1:17:21] word is true
[1:17:23] Hallelujah so Satan knows then
[1:17:27] the Bottomless Pits is ready for him
[1:17:32] Hallelujah
[1:17:34] one thing for him to see
[1:17:36] Jesus on a white horse riding down is
[1:17:39] one thing for him to see him but when he
[1:17:41] sees you
[1:17:46] but Bill he's going to see you he's
[1:17:47] going to say there's that one I kicked
[1:17:49] him all over Hardy
[1:17:51] I I gave him sicknesses I I made it hard
[1:17:54] for him to work I did I made it hard for
[1:17:56] him to keep his family in the house of
[1:17:58] God I did everything I could to
[1:17:59] discourage him and here he is riding Out
[1:18:01] of Heaven vindicating the word of God
[1:18:04] maybe he went by way of the gravery when
[1:18:06] the Rapture but there he is
[1:18:08] and it so demoralizes the devil that he
[1:18:11] says oh the bottomless fits like oh I
[1:18:13] want to demoralize him tonight don't you
[1:18:16] hey man the resurrection vindicates
[1:18:21] Hallelujah we're just getting started
[1:18:24] Church
[1:18:27] so much here
[1:18:28] look
[1:18:30] I'm not talking about tonight I'm gonna
[1:18:31] let you go tonight
[1:18:39] Satan knows
[1:18:41] Bottomless Pits is ready for him
[1:18:44] I believe that when you raise your hand
[1:18:45] in spite
[1:18:47] of what he's done to you in spite of how
[1:18:49] he's fought you
[1:18:52] a spite of going through hell and back I
[1:18:55] can say it that way
[1:18:56] you have to bury yesterday because
[1:18:59] yesterday's too painful to remember
[1:19:01] and so you you don't want to have to
[1:19:03] look back at it and say you have to just
[1:19:05] keep going and keep going and keep going
[1:19:07] and every day you wake up as a
[1:19:09] resurrected son or daughter of God you
[1:19:11] just you discourage the devil you
[1:19:13] demoralize him you make him realize that
[1:19:16] his end is coming there for him
[1:19:18] he tries all that much harder he don't
[1:19:20] quit he don't even quit when Jesus
[1:19:21] writes down he tries to defeat him but
[1:19:24] he cannot defeat him greater is he that
[1:19:26] is in you than he that is in the world
[1:19:29] you are his vindication
[1:19:31] his word is true
[1:19:34] Hallelujah
[1:19:35] amen
[1:19:37] and all you notice
[1:19:40] you realize all the accusations he
[1:19:41] wasted his time
[1:19:44] you realize the accuser has stood up
[1:19:46] there for all of these years 6 000 years
[1:19:49] he stood in the presence of God and
[1:19:51] accused and brother Branham in the four
[1:19:53] seal he said he he stands there and says
[1:19:55] I I talked to Eve and and I got her to
[1:19:58] do things that were against the word and
[1:20:00] oh but and the father one day he's going
[1:20:02] to get kicked out of heaven and he's
[1:20:04] gonna see you the ones he accused and
[1:20:06] wasted his time on riding back on white
[1:20:08] horses
[1:20:10] talk about demoralize
[1:20:14] might as well quit devil
[1:20:18] can't win
[1:20:22] look at it it's Jezebel it's a jezebel
[1:20:24] system now once you watch this we'll
[1:20:27] close
[1:20:28] he said he notice what happened after
[1:20:29] death their dead bodies are destroyed by
[1:20:31] wild beasts
[1:20:33] just like Jezebel
[1:20:34] Jezebel in the Old Testament is the type
[1:20:36] of the church today according to the
[1:20:37] word of God brother Brandon said now he
[1:20:40] talks about Revelation 2 18 which we
[1:20:41] already read
[1:20:42] in Second Kings 9 36 I love this
[1:20:45] remember remember the servants came and
[1:20:48] told jehu after he caused Jezebel to be
[1:20:50] cast into the street
[1:20:53] and then they told him they couldn't
[1:20:54] find the body all they found was kind of
[1:20:56] gruesome all they found was the hands
[1:20:58] and the feet and the skull
[1:21:02] they said what happened to her the dogs
[1:21:04] ate her and they remembered
[1:21:08] they remembered the word of a prophet
[1:21:12] Elijah to be specific
[1:21:15] and they said this is the word of the
[1:21:17] Lord which he spake by his servant
[1:21:19] Elijah in the portion of Jezreel shall
[1:21:22] dogs eat the Flesh of Jezebel he said
[1:21:24] the same thing happens to the Jezebel
[1:21:27] church and her daughters Revelation 19
[1:21:29] 17. and when he comes down on the White
[1:21:32] Horse I saw an angel standing in the sun
[1:21:34] he cried with a loud voice saying to all
[1:21:36] the fouls that fly in the midst of
[1:21:38] Heaven Come and gather yourselves
[1:21:39] together
[1:21:41] unto the supper of the great God
[1:21:43] he said the Jezebel churcher actually
[1:21:45] bodies to be eaten
[1:21:47] by a thousand Beasts of the earth just
[1:21:49] exactly like Ahab and Jezebel was in the
[1:21:51] natural so are they to be in the
[1:21:52] spiritual form of church
[1:21:54] he said to Elijah was the prophet in the
[1:21:56] days of Ahab and Jezebel National and he
[1:21:58] has promised to do the same thing
[1:21:59] according to thus saith the Lord in the
[1:22:01] word to The Jezebel spiritual his Spirit
[1:22:03] form of ministry so he actually spoke
[1:22:06] their judgment
[1:22:07] Elijah though in his day properly and
[1:22:10] profoundly Vindicated he said could not
[1:22:12] turn them back to the word
[1:22:14] remember Elijah thought he was all alone
[1:22:17] he said I didn't do nothing remember
[1:22:18] brother random had those same thoughts
[1:22:21] he looked at that church at American
[1:22:23] church he said Lord is this what I
[1:22:24] produced
[1:22:26] right but then he saw a preview of The
[1:22:28] Bride
[1:22:30] amen and Elijah thought that he he never
[1:22:33] could you remember this is the the
[1:22:35] famous quote where brother Brandon said
[1:22:36] 700 instead of seven thousand everybody
[1:22:38] gets hung up on that but there's a great
[1:22:39] spiritual truth here
[1:22:41] Elijah never even knew one of them was
[1:22:43] that way he said
[1:22:45] look these seven thousand were unknown
[1:22:47] to the prophet
[1:22:50] I never knew him
[1:22:51] but I believed the word
[1:22:55] the seven thousand were unknown to
[1:22:56] Elijah he thought he was the only one
[1:22:57] saved until God opened up one of the
[1:22:59] seals and showed him the mystery in the
[1:23:02] book he had 700 that never bowed down to
[1:23:04] them Creeds that they had that's the
[1:23:06] reason he said I think John was doing a
[1:23:08] lot of shouting the other night he must
[1:23:10] have seen his name on there
[1:23:11] he said here is the fourth seal open and
[1:23:14] the writers are the four horses that's
[1:23:15] revealed to the best of my knowledge he
[1:23:17] said now this is all that took place
[1:23:20] on the Earth
[1:23:24] he told us all of it
[1:23:26] think about it
[1:23:28] this is all that took place
[1:23:31] on the earth now we get in the fifth
[1:23:32] seal we go to heaven
[1:23:34] you can see what's been happening in
[1:23:35] heaven what's happening in heaven
[1:23:37] this is all that took place
[1:23:40] on the earth I'm so glad I won't be here
[1:23:42] to see some of this
[1:23:44] huh
[1:23:45] he said the next seal we see is in
[1:23:46] heaven
[1:23:48] where Souls
[1:23:49] are under the altar sometimes we get
[1:23:51] discouraged as musicians are coming
[1:23:54] sometimes we get discouraged we think
[1:23:56] well the business anybody believe the
[1:23:58] message anymore
[1:23:59] is anybody going to make it
[1:24:01] said I got seven thousand
[1:24:05] got seven thousand not bowed their knees
[1:24:08] to bail
[1:24:10] oh my
[1:24:11] God he said I got people you don't even
[1:24:13] know about
[1:24:14] I believe that's the case tonight
[1:24:16] there's people we don't we've never even
[1:24:18] met
[1:24:19] love the Lord with all of their heart
[1:24:22] I've been in some of their homes
[1:24:23] overseas
[1:24:25] and it humbles me because I realize
[1:24:27] there's people like that all over the
[1:24:28] world
[1:24:29] or they may have little different
[1:24:30] customs and things but this same message
[1:24:33] that I preach they're preaching the same
[1:24:35] word that I preach they're preaching it
[1:24:37] in in the Middle East they're preaching
[1:24:39] it all over Africa they're preaching it
[1:24:41] in Asia they're preaching different
[1:24:42] parts of the world I've been privileged
[1:24:44] to be and some of you all have seen some
[1:24:46] of the things that over the years where
[1:24:48] missionaries have went and come back and
[1:24:50] you know it's a it's a great inspiration
[1:24:52] to me to know God's word is true
[1:24:56] there will be a people that'll be
[1:24:58] raptured a little Remnant he calls them
[1:25:00] but don't don't worry you're not alone
[1:25:02] there's a great cloud of witnesses that
[1:25:06] are cheering you on from the other side
[1:25:08] already went home would you bow your
[1:25:10] heads with me I want to I want to ask
[1:25:12] you tonight what power are you following
[1:25:14] what part of Elijah's message speaks to
[1:25:17] you
[1:25:19] some people are attracted by
[1:25:22] by the part of the message that shows
[1:25:26] War coming and famine and sicknesses and
[1:25:30] all the things that are coming on the
[1:25:32] earth and that's something we know it's
[1:25:33] something that that Elijah's message
[1:25:35] showed us
[1:25:37] we've been lifted up to see those things
[1:25:39] that's not what attracted me to the
[1:25:41] message
[1:25:42] attracted me to this message
[1:25:45] when I
[1:25:47] started looking at it
[1:25:49] and I began to realize that's me
[1:25:55] that's not me in the tribulation period
[1:25:58] that's not me in the
[1:26:02] one that got deceived by the by the
[1:26:05] beast that's not me it's not me one that
[1:26:08] had had to hide from an atomic bomb
[1:26:10] that's not me
[1:26:12] but I saw me
[1:26:14] riding on a white horse
[1:26:16] coming back with him called the word of
[1:26:19] God
[1:26:21] no matter what you go through how deep
[1:26:22] your trials get how hard it gets

[1:27:00] see myself in the word I'm not I'm not
[1:27:03] following I'm not can being condemned by
[1:27:06] the message I'm being lifted up
[1:27:09] by the same Elijah the same Elijah that
[1:27:13] showed the destruction of Jezebel
[1:27:16] but also also he showed the elevation of
[1:27:19] Elisha and the quickening power that
[1:27:22] would come oh my that's the agent we
[1:27:24] live in the same Elijah that showed the
[1:27:26] foolish virgin and showed the false
[1:27:28] Church also showed the bride and I'm so
[1:27:31] glad to be a part of that tonight
