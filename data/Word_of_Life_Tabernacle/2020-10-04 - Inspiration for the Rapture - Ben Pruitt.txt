by way of uplifted hand i believe he sees every heart and your your hand lifted is a is a testimony that uh there's something there but you believe god can take care of it amen we believe he's that god today and i want to especially pray for sister ruth pruitt and talked to brother timothy this morning and she's really sick and in the hospital and so we're gonna ask god to intervene for that and and for each one of our needs every one of those hands that were raised we believe in a miracle working god today heavenly father we thank you for lord bringing us together once again and protecting us lord and providing for us lord healing us father so thankful for the fire of your spirit within our hearts that brings this lord to a place like this lord i pray for each one of these requests lord that we're made known by way of uplifted hand you see their need you see lord the the reason behind it father even to defy the law of gravity to raise a hand it must be some purpose lord father you know what it is big or little lord doesn't matter to you you're able lord to take care of every situation father i pray for sister pruitt this morning that you would just give her the strength that she needs and lord to overcome this this coveted the satan has fought us so much on this area but lord we believe that you're still god and if satan is fighting lord then we know that you're about to do something and so we thank you for that lord and for each one father that is in need i think of brother bruce this morning lord and his family mourning the loss of a mother i pray god you would comfort them lord and give them strength father knowing where she is lord that she believed lord and it was a she had that the spirit which was a down payment of the resurrection the lord and so it's already assured and we're thankful for that today father i pray you'd bless each one lord as the word goes forth today may it not just be a a dry letter lord may it be a life a living thing god that speaks into our hearts and speaks life life to us we pray in jesus name amen amen it's good to know the presence of the lord is with us this morning turn with me to hebrews chapter 11 and verses 5 and 6. and then we'll also read from job chapter 32 and verse 8. that's hebrews 11 verses 5 and 6 and job 32-8 i don't remember the funeral coming up on tuesday and then we'll have our regular service on wednesday night so thankful to be able to still gather together and we believe that's given the devil a black eye my father would have been 68 years old today if he had lived he's been gone for about 10 years but he took us to church and i'm thankful for that my mother's here today and and my brother and family i uh i'm thankful for that you know you can do a lot of things wrong but if you take your children to church and get them around god's people get them exposed to the word and to the message of the hour that's saying something you've done something of eternal value in their lives so thank you for that if you brought your children today i'm a testimony of what god can do and how god can change your life hebrews chapter 11 and verse 5 says by faith enoch was translated that he should not see death and was not found because god had translated him for before his translation he had this testimony that he pleased god don't you want that to be your testimony well here's how you have that testimony said but without faith it is impossible to please him verse 6 without faith it is impossible to please him for he that cometh to god must believe that he is and that he is the rewarder of them that diligently seek him and then job and 32-8 it says but there is a spirit in man and the inspiration of the almighty giveth them understanding i'd like to speak on inspiration for the rapture i pray lord would add his blessing to the word you may be seated this morning many of you are familiar with i didn't bring any of the quotes but many of you are familiar with the phrase if you don't have faith for a headache how can you have rapturing faith or something to that extent that brother branham would say we don't have faith for a headache how can we have rapturing faith i've always taken that as an indictment of faith and i misunderstood it because it's not an indictment of the faith that we have brother branham is challenging challenging us to acknowledge that we do have the faith for a headache that faith has to be inspired it's got to be stimulated something there's got to be something happen to make that faith awaken in our lives and make it real and and so brother branham would tie that he talked about healing and said that healing is an earnest or a down payment on the resurrection if you get uh if you get healed as we talked about wednesday night you'll get sick again but it's a down payment it's showing us something it's god telling us look i've healed you i'm going to change your body i've healed you i'm going to give you a new body and so it's a down payment on the resurrection now uh the inspiration is is what comes to us that enables our faith to be put into actual uh work and action in our lives and so that we've got to have there's got to be an inspiration and there's got to be a revelation and brother branham said that faith is a revelation that it actually has to become real to us in a way and i believe that god does this for us at the right time and and so i don't want us to be sitting here and thinking well if i could do more if i could if i could live better if i could go to church more if i could do these things then maybe i i could be ready when a rapture comes then i'd catch it no it's something that when the time comes just like when you really needed healing healing come to you and whatever you needed in your life suddenly you caught the inspiration for that and and it came and so in god's time inspiration for the rapture just drops down and that's the moment when the bride catches it and we'll be ready at that time how will we be ready because god's already provided a way for us to be ready through the message of the hour and and the work of the holy spirit in our lives now inspiration is actually a word that if you go back into the origins of it it's a word that means to breathe or to blow into and so it means to breathe and it means also to influence to move or to guide through divine or supernatural agency or power so inspiration now has a inspiration as a term just means to uh to breathe in but actually uh in the the figurative meaning preceded the literal meaning which is not common in words but the figurative meaning was to move under divine or supernatural agency or power so it means to breathe or blow upon and then to breathe in or to infuse life by breathing and the scripture says in second timothy 3 16 that all scripture is given by inspiration of god and actually that greek word is is expiration god breathed literally the it's inspired of god it's the greek word theo nustos which is god breathed and now we look at the time that we live in and these are difficult times these are difficult times but in the scriptures they they come across difficult times and they had to face mountains and they had to face the devil and they had to deal with sickness and they had to deal with all these things but why were they able to deal with it because god breathed inspiration so that the word that was given could fit the hour that they lived in oh i hope you hear me today now and so when that when they needed it at an hour when everything was dark and all was lost when they needed it that word circled the earth until the time come and then it was inspired to the hearts of a believer and it become reality in their lives now when what inspiration does for us is it causes us to continue to pursue a goal through hardship and so you've got to have some inspiration if you're going to make it through life just just in the natural you've got to be inspired to something maybe your children inspire you maybe your your family your wife maybe something you've read maybe a father maybe a mother something had to inspire you to do what you're doing today it could be something good it could be something bad it could be just something that made you what you are today something's got to inspire you if you're going to act in a way that would make you pursue a goal through hardship brother branham tells us in the message returning jubilee he said it goes to show what faith can do he said i think if a person ever is sure in their heart and has something that faith can anchor on he said they should never cease amen he said no matter how many times they're defeated they should continue on amen and brother branham when he's telling that he's telling a story of walt disney he talks about how that walt disney was a in a garage and he'd been sent his drawings to people and they've been rejected time and time again and he's sitting in a rat infested garage and he's watching as the mice play in the garage and all of a sudden something hit something inspired him as he watched a particular mouse as it as it played there in the garage and when that inspired him something happened that he created a multi-million dollar empire actually multi-billion dollar empire and so brother branham picks up on that story he said if a man can do that by the natural he said what about a man that's been pulsated by the holy spirit and that's another word that brother brown uses for inspiration or stimulation is pulsation pulsation is something inside of you that that pulses something that that causes you to do more than what you thought you could do he said that's been pulsated by the holy spirit that believes that god wants his achievements to be brought to people and will stay with the scripture amen now how we are inspired depends on the potentials that we have you see many men had seen mice play on the floor didn't do nothing for them other than inspire them to go out and buy a mouse trap right that's what it would do for me it wouldn't inspire me to draw a drawing and and make a billion dollar empire out of it i'd buy a mousetrap right and so you look at different men that have been inspired in that way and isaac newton was inspired when an apple fell and apple fell and and i don't know if it hit him on the head as the story goes but he saw that he thought gravity and i saw an apple fell and all i wanted to do was eat the apple right and so you you could maybe you you've not been inspired as others were and because it's just not in everybody to be inspired in that way with me now it already had to be in them even though walt disney didn't have the multi-billion dollar company but the the the potentials of that company the potentials of mickey mouse was already inside of him well you've got something inside of you that's much greater than mickey mouse much greater than anything this world could be inspired to but there's something inside of you that that can be inspired hope you're with me now there's something inside of the believer that can be inspired to live in a perfect place there's something inside of the believer that can be inspired to heaven the world wouldn't even even be happy there you know people wouldn't even be they talk about going to heaven but they really wouldn't even understand or wouldn't be content to be there but there's something inside of the seed of god that's inspirable if that's the word that's able to be inspired into what god wants them to be so there's something inside of you that's able to live i hope you're hearing me this morning something inside of the believer is able to live in the land that's why our sister and i've heard i didn't know her but i've heard that passed away i've heard so many good things about her life and how she lived why she was inspired how to live in a better place are you with me now she was inspired here and it shows in your life here how you're inspired for over there i don't fit here i'm a pilgrim and a stranger why did abraham wander the earth like he did why did he go back and forth and never was content and had no continuing city on this earth why did he live that way because he was inspired for a city that was not made with hands now not many people today recognize the name of edward everett edward everett was a great speaker a great politician and also a preacher he was a great man he was called to speak at gettysburg on november 19 1863 because of he was a great orator he spoke for over two hours had his thoughts carefully if you read it it's hard to read but if you read it it has his thoughts carefully prepared and every line just laid out just perfectly but a man named abraham lincoln was president and they asked him to come and just speak for a moment and on the way there he scribbles it down on a napkin in the train what he's going to say he spoke for three minutes edward everett spoke over three hours mr everett had carefully prepared his speech lincoln wrote his on the back of a napkin which one survived all right and but that ought to be a lesson to some of us preachers but abraham lincoln spoke for three minutes but what it was it was inspired it was inspired to that moment and to deal with that situation are you with me now but joel may have been agreeing too much there so now brother branham talks about in the message whatever he says to you do it he says now on the platform he said when the holy spirit's speaking he said he's speaking through mortal lips now he he don't stop there but he says he always does he always does he said i believe these are ministers behind me he said and brethren you never preached a sermon in your life the holy spirit preached through you a sermon said that's right see we don't preach the holy spirit does the speaking he said oh we might write out something and read it but that isn't preaching now watch he said preaching was is when inspiration comes and it's preached by inspiration and the holy spirit gives the unction now he says now we can read something and it just doesn't matter when the holy spirit gets a hold of it so it's not wrong to read it he's not saying it's wrong to have notes or read something because brother branham did that he said it's not it's not that you're reading it but he said when the holy spirit gets a hold of what you're reading takes it out to the people then something takes hold he said and that's the holy spirit he said that's not your pastor preaching that's the holy spirit preaching in your pastor out to you giving the message well here's the sermon we talked about this morning brother david and the unchangeable god working in an unexpectable way brother brown says well now he has no hands on earth but mine and yours his voice on earth is ours our voice is given to him he said that's why we preached the gospel he said we believe it's not us we're inspired to preach those things the holy spirit is speaking through us so a word spoken by inspiration can do more than a thousand words spoken by knowledge right just by what we know and so he said we're inspired to preach those things now he said we don't believe it's we can do that he said certainly not he said i know i couldn't he said we know that it's the inspiration of the holy spirit and if you're going to speak that way something has to be inspired and it's your faith that's inspired to speak again as we talked about wednesday night there's got to be an inspiration that comes and brother branham dealt with that and maybe we'll get into it in some other sermon but brother branham dealt with how the people ask him a question and i've always wanted to meet the person who wrote this question to brother branham because you know they they were looking for a shortcut is what it sounds like because they said brother branham if if you could speak the word and speak the squirrels all these things he said couldn't you just speak us a new body and brother adam said yes basically is what he said but then he went on and said you have to you have to only do what you're told right you can't do it i'm paraphrasing but you can't do it unless you're told to do it and he explains it in very much detail so that's not what it was see you've got to speak are you with me now and i believe with all my heart that it won't be it won't be any man or any prophet speaking that'll put you in a rapture it'll be you speaking the message of the prophet or the message of god are you with me now it has to be and you go and look at what brother branham taught and how he taught it in the unveiling of god and perfect faith and all those things it's you that speaks right and then when you speak it puts you in the place he's putting it back on you as we read wednesday night he said the third poll he said puts it back on the people right now now brother branham says in he said hear him in 1956 he said that's the way it is this afternoon and he had just he just told the story excuse me for for breaking things up but my mind is is whirling this morning i'm i'm praying that god will just somehow take these pieces and put them together in a way that we can understand but brother branham said that's the way it is this afternoon and he was talking about how jesus talked to his disciples and said who do you say that i am he said who do men say that i am he then he said who do you say that i am and peter said thou art the christ why he was inspired to that to speak that and and here you hear him by the brahman said that's the way it is this afternoon if our nature becomes converted from the things of the world to the nature of the holy spirit god will take his stand i love that and he will abide on us amen if our nature becomes converted from the things of the world to the nature of the holy spirit god will take his stand and he will abide on us listen inspired believers taking in the inspired word those two together bring the results it brings the word to life then what can we have this morning what are our limitations what what can we have happen here among us this morning when inspired believers come and take in the inspired word brother brown said that's two omnipotents meat amen inspired believers taking in the inspired word what can happen he said the inspiration that's in your heart puts the word to living amen the inspiration in your heart puts the word to living because he said you could take a grain of corn lay it on a desk no matter how well it's polished it might be 14 carats it'll never produce any more corn he said no matter how pretty the desk is how genuine the gold is it's laying on he said how real germatized the corn is the corns got to fall in the rich fertile dirt to bring forth results once they gotta fall in inspired dirt are you with me now he said when the word of god amen is put into the fertile grounds of the inspired believer what does it produce it produces just exactly what god said it would do amen don't you see those two inspirations have to me that's why we have to stay only with the word we can't take a man's word for it can't take our somebody else's word for it a preacher's word for it we've got to stay with the word because the word of god is in an omnipotent and then we are an omnipotent when you put those two things together it's the word meaning the word the inspired word meaning the inspired word when the word of god is put in the fertile grounds of the inspired believer it produces just exactly what god said it would do because it can't fail you believe that today it can't fail it's god's eternal word got to awaken the people i love this got to bring us to something when the word is received when the word is received now take that back to healing which we talked about wednesday night if you're healed then you had to receive your healing not just believe on with the mind but receive it amen receive your healing you got to be inspired to it and so now he said you've got to receive it when the word is received it brings us to something it's got to he said and that's the inspiration and man is in no condition outside of repentance he's no condition to receive the word until first he's been inspired that's why you can't just educate someone into the message he's got to be inspired to it if he's not inspired to it it doesn't do any good and i could sit there and argue and counsel and work with him work with him work with him but it's got to be inspired there's got to be something that makes it real it says i believe this is true and what was that was the way hattie wright was she stood there and she said it's nothing but the truth what was it the word that was coming through a prophet she was inspired to that word when she was the word did what it promised what it said it would do amen could i put it this way the word did what she said it would do. amen because that was the promise of the word that you and your family could be saved and so the word did and that's where brother brown says you got to make your decision like joshua made his son stand still you got to make your decision the word did what she said it would do amen hallelujah now he said feeling good this morning you just thank you thank you for for praying now brother branham talks about peter said look at peter down there they said who do men say i the son of man am some say you're john the baptist others said they are elias some said you're the prophet jeremiah and others say you're the prophet that was to come jesus answered and said who do you say that i am see salvation is not based upon what someone else thinks it's what you think of him divine healing isn't based on what the critic says or what the church says it's based on your perfect faith in the inspired word of god and how you're inspired to believe that let me read that part again it's based on your perfect faith in the inspired word of god and how you're inspired to believe that he said that's what brings the results is your inspiration by the word he said what does it do for you he said who does men say as the son of man i am he said some jeremiah son of the prophet said but who do you say that i am he said oh sometimes this cost a price to really say it sometimes it causes separations in homes sometimes it causes separations in churches sometimes it causes separation in lodges in all walks of life sometimes between husband and wife he said to really speak out who do you say that i am amen he said but i like peter he said he has a lot of mistakes like i have amen he said but this one time hallelujah don't you realize he said well i've made too many mistakes i can't go in a rapture but this one time this one time he was really inspired yes he stood up quickly and said the hour to christ the son of the living god oh my what a statement thou art the christ hallelujah paul was so inspired by an angel one time that spoke to him and said he would appear before caesar that he could whistle during a storm he could lay there sleeping while the storm was raging and when the boat broke apart he said not one of not one person will be lost and he gets it he gets to an island and he's gathering wood he puts it on the fire and snake bites him he just shakes it off why because he was inspired to the word of god said you'll appear before caesar he believed that he was inspired to him luther was inspired by the revelation of justification he was inspired by the the understanding of what this meant the gesture lived by faith he was so inspired he went to the church door and he nailed 95 thesis to the door at wittenberg and wesley was so inspired all by the revelation of sanctification that he preached in the fields and england shook for the gospel they said that the revival was so great that that when when wesleyanism would come through a town when when the revival would come through that there would be no bars left no pubs there would be there would be no drugs it would just the whole town would be converted why because a man was inspired that god's word was true that you could live for god see it took inspiration to to the word for that hour you know and you could be inspired to that today we are inspired to that word today but we have more we're inspired to the word for our day are you with me now but during that time when the inspiration struck at the time that it was supposed to come it shook england now the end time bride is inspired what are we inspired by now i you could take from the message of the hour and we could see that there's something that's got to happen so we can have rapturing faith and and i don't even like the way i put that but you understand we have faith right it has to be inspired and so if you say oh i don't have any faith but jesus said if you had the faith of a grain of a mustard seed right and and so how much faith does it take to change your body well it takes the faith god's faith the faith that's in you right and you have that faith but you're not inspired to it yet you say how could you say that but then well we're not changed right but yet the inspiration has come to us and there's something come to us that's bringing us to that place because the rapture is not just an event but it's something that's going on there's a work going on among the bride that's bringing you to that place and what's happening is actually you're being inspired to the word for your day now what in particular would inspire you to that word brother branham says that speaking of in this in is this the sign of the answer he speaks of the angels of the church age angels he said the other angels was messengers men of the earth but this angel is speaking of the angel in revelation 10 1. these said to the angel church of laodicea to the angel of the church of ephesus messengers of the earth see men messengers prophets so forth to the church but this one didn't come from the earth he come down from heaven because the mystery is all finished and when the mystery is finished the angel said time shall be no more and seven thunders throw their voices out and he says this he said what if it is something to let us know how to enter into the rapturing he said is it will we run leap over walls well that takes something for me to do that will it run will we run leap over walls there is there something fixing to happen he said in these old marred vile bodies are going to be changed oh i believe it he said can i live to see it o lord is it so close that i'll see it he said is this the generation he's asking these questions sirs he said my brethren what time is it where are we at and on down on that sermon he says and i don't know i don't know slurs i'm only honest with you as my brothers i don't know is it time is the mystery all finished it's the sounding all over he said is that really them seven thunders fixing to utter out something that the little group that has gathered together will receive a rapturing faith to go in the rapture when he comes he said for will be changed as quick as those angels come in a moment in a twinkling of an eye shall be caught up together with those that had sleep or had slept to meet the lord in the air now brother branham so he speaks of this could it be that it'll be those seven thunders that'll bring that about and in the first seal again he says at the end of the pentecostal age we're supposed to receive according to the word as god help me tonight to show you through here that we are to see receive a messenger that will take all those loose ends out there and reveal the whole secret of god for the rapturing of the church he said then there is coming forth seven mysterious thunders that's not even written at all now keep in mind what he says later and we'll read it about how that it was there but it wasn't revealed he said that's right he said i believe that through those seven thunders will be revealed he said in the last days in order to get the bride together for rapturing faith because what we got right now we wouldn't be able to do it and they had faith for healing but that's just a down payment on what's coming right now so there had to be something coming brother reynolds ministry that would come to that and if you go back and refer back to what we preached on wednesday night how brother branham kept talking about the third poll and how it was coming and what it was and how that the spoken word was a sign of that and what's coming he said and brother brown says there is something he said we've got to step farther and this is in the first seal he said we can't have enough faith for divine healing hardly we've got to have enough faith to be changed in a moment and be swept out of this earth and we'll find that after a while i love this the lord willing to find where it's written he said it's seven thunders that weren't even written at all and he said well fine where it's written amen amen and and don't get nervous on me i'm not about to preach that the thunders or the virtues so i'm i'm gonna stay right with the message this morning we'll be all right if we do that right you know what brother branham talked about how that he a man went to hire a mule driver or a driver to drive him around up a mountain he said he went to higher one he said oh yeah he said i'm the best driver there is i can get so close to the edge that i can just i just ride right along the edge all the way up he said i don't want him he finally found an old man that said i'm not very good he said but i stay just as close as i can to the wall to the mountain that's what we want didn't it stay just as close as i can to the message of the hour because that's what's going to take us home now now he says he says uh in the first seal again he said but when he started to write these other seven thunders he said don't write it he'd been commissioned to write everything he's seen but when those seven thunders over in revelation 10 uttered he said don't write them at all he said they're mysteries we don't know what they are yet but my opinion they'll be revealed right away he said and when it does it'll give faith for that rapturing grace remember what we talked about wednesday night that rapturing grace has to be there for rapturing faith you can't do it on your own you can't produce rapturing faith by yourself it's got to be rapturing grace by the way so those astronauts are wrapped in rapturing grace for rapturing faith and so he said for that church to move out he said this and and so we find that that's true and brother brown talked about how that'll do that now so we could establish in the seven thunders at least what brother brown said that they would bring about rapturing faith and so then we would ask what are the seven thunders and i know some of you many of you maybe all of you know this but we've got to know where we stand and be reminded of where we're at because the devil will shake you with current conditions right the devil will use you know time is the enemy of faith i've always preached that time is the enemy of faith and that's why as time goes on as the delay continues people jesus talked about how that they begin to smite one another and all these things begin to happen because of time time you begin to think well it's not going to happen but abraham held on he was the father of faith because he held on to the promise all the way through until he saw it fulfilled and so time being the enemy of faith you begin to think well what's going to happen and people have come up with all kinds of ideas well they said well brother branham has to come back and preach those seven thunders to put us in a rapturing condition but there's no scripture for that and if that was the case then what about what we're about to read where brother brown said that he already did it right and so that wouldn't make any sense it wouldn't fit with the word and so then someone might say and well-meaning people might say well uh you know you have to the thunders you have to realize that they're the virtues but brother didn't ever say that right that's a problem it's a problem for us to preach what brother branham never said but if he actually told us what it was then we believe it and it's not to try to make something out of it that it's not but to believe what's there and the challenge i think of our day is to to place ourselves and stand steady brother branham talked about and there's a great quote you can go find it but around talked about how the stabilizers have been put on the ship this is a time when when it looks like nothing's going on but god's doing something something great now so brother branham if you'll go if you want to understand the thunders and you want to understand how that fits with the seals you go to a sermon called christ is the mystery of god revealed brother branham talks about it and he says god's great mystery of how it's a secret he said he kept it a secret nobody knows nothing about it he said even the angels didn't understand it he didn't reveal it he said that's the reason under our seventh mystery when the seventh seal was open there was silence jesus when he was on earth they want to know when he would come he said even the son of man son himself don't know when he's when it's going to happen see god has this all to himself it's a secret he said that's the reason there was silence in heaven for a space of a half hour seven thunders under their voices since john was even forbidden to write it see the coming of the lord he said that's one thing he hasn't revealed yet of how he will come and when he will come he said it's a good thing that he doesn't but iran talked about how part of that seven steal was revealed he said and then there was a part that was still a mystery now there will be a part that remains a mystery no one's ever going to know the day in the hour right but there had to be part that we understood because our faith had to be inspired to it there had to be something that made us understand more than what the what the world understands what the nominal church understands there had to be something that come in and made us understand he's coming and that be more than just a well he's coming one day but it'd be a reality he's coming because i know i've seen the seventh of the messenger come i've seen that the seals open the thunders have uttered their voices these things have happened and so i know he's not just coming but we're living right here and it's that understanding that it that actually ignites our faith that inspires our faith to a body change are you with me now but not just a mental understanding but a revelation of it amen i don't think we've really caught a revelation because when we get fully to that revelation of it our bodies will be changed amen now look brother branham says it's one thing he hasn't revealed yet how he will come when he will come it's a good thing he doesn't he said he is out but look this next quote this follows it exactly that was paragraph 106 this is 107. he said he doesn't know he has showed or revealed it in every type that's in the bible so he said god has this all to himself but he says he showed or revealed in every type that's in the bible therefore the entire bible is the revelation of god's mystery in christ the entire bible is an expression of one goal that god had amen one purpose he wanted to achieve in the entire bible now what do we say about inspiration you're inspired to reach a goal in spite of hardship why because of the revelation that you have walt disney had a revelation he had that inspiration hey this mickey mouse there's something to it i see a business i see being able to support my family i see something and he didn't even understand maybe all that it was but he was inspired to it oh church don't you realize you've got to be inspired to the message of the hour and people draw inspiration from all kinds of things there's people who draw inspiration by how loud you preach but pentecost has that there's people who draw inspiration from from how much jumping and dancing and shouting and i i like i'm i'll be honest i'm inspired by that too but i love to see that but the inspiration for the rapture comes from somewhere else it doesn't come from anything pentecost had because his brother brown said pentecost could not could not copy this there's got to be something greater than what they had it's got to be something greater than even what we've had but it's got to be an inspiration to the word of god for our hour amen are you with me now so you can say brother do you believe something greater is coming yes i do it's the rapture the culmination of that it's the finalization of the change of our bodies that's what's coming that's what we're reaching to but it comes by inspiration by revelation of the word of god now he says all the acts of the believers in the bible has been in time and expressing what god's great goal is and now in this last day he has revealed it and shows it he said and god's help will see it right here this morning what the lord has had in his mind all along and has expressed it he talked about that threefold purpose of god now in the unveiling of god i know i'm reading a lot this morning but i pray the holy spirit as the prophet said would inspire these words to you he said everyone has always come to me and said brother branham them seven thunders that the voice thundered he said write it not but close it up he said that'll be seven thunders that will be revealed in the last days see seven thunders that'll tell us he said now don't that sound real good but watch what you're talking about when you say that he said see that you write it not he said these seven thunders uttered their voices see and he said don't write that but it's to be sealed up in the book until the last days he said now someone many has been saying to me and theologians said brother branham he said with the lord god with your experience that the lord has given you for his people humbly saying this said you would be eligible to write a bible yourself your word if god is manifested i said that might be true see he was trying to catch me i said but you see i couldn't do that he said why couldn't you you have all the qualifications i said but you look one word cannot be added or taken away right now you ladies know if you're go if you mix up a recipe and there's something in it there are ingredients you can leave out or change swap out right but there are essential ingredients that have to remain in the recipe and if they're not there the cake don't rise or it don't taste right you've got to have it there's essential ingredients for making it happen if you like to eat pancakes you need flour right and now i see where they make these low-carb pancakes i've been looking at those i'm afraid to try it because flour is kind of an essential ingredient right to a pancake right and and just like sausage is an essential ingredient to gravy now you may not agree with that but it is amen now so that's essentials there's things that maybe don't matter and brother branham talked about that he would come on a white horse or a white cloud and things like that there are things that don't matter but what the word says is essential and if those ingredients aren't there you can't you can't have a rapture right and so now brother branham says he talks about it he said you he said one word can be added or taken away he said well then the seven thunders you see wouldn't them seven thunders blasting out won't that be a revelation be given to some man i said no sir it would be adding something to it or taking something from it it's all revealed in there and the seven seals opened up the revelation of what that was amen he said that's what it was see it's still in the word you see you can't get out of that word it won't leave the word and god's spirit will never leave that word it'll stay right with the word he said blinding some and open the eyes of others shall always do that so again in the feast of the trumpets brother brown said he said that this and that day when he'd seen him come down and eat up the little book and he said he put one foot on land and one on the sea or by him that lives forever and ever the time shall be no more he did seven thunders under their voices when the seven thunders under their voices dawn said he was about to write he said don't write it he said and he sealed it he said now someone said well that's seven seals brother brandon that will be revealed in the last days some great mystery of how we get closer to god now look no sir it can't be it won't be the mystery of how we get closer to god won't be revealed by something outside the scriptures he says whoever whosoever shall take one word from this bible or add one word to it this part will be taken the book of life what it what it is is a revelation on what has been missed back there it's already wrote here it's in here it's to reveal what already has been written because you can't add one thing to it or take one word from it brother man was asked a question directly have the seven thunders which equals seven mysteries already been revealed were they revealed in the seven seals he said but are yet not known to us as the thunders yet so they said well maybe maybe it's just not known to us because people couldn't see it and brother ram said no they were revealed in the seven seals that's what the thunders was about the seven thunders they was to reveal the seven thunders that had uttered their voices no one could make out what it was john knew what it was but he was forbidden to write it he said but the seventh angel in the days of his sounding the seven mysteries of the seven thunders will be revealed and the seventh angel is the messenger of the seventh church age so the the mystery in it you look at it and think what do we know now that we didn't know before the seals were open we know what the mystery was right it was a white horse it was a red horse it was a black horse we didn't know what it meant what do we know now that we didn't know what would be sealed up and then revealed at the end what would those seven thunders say we know what we didn't know which is the mystery of it amen now he says in the church age book again i'll read this he said now this messenger of malachi 4 in revelation 10 7 is going to do two things one according to malachi 4 he will turn the hearts of the children to the fathers 2 he will reveal the mysteries of the 7 thunders in revelation 10 which are the revelations contained in the seven seals now listen what he says it will be these divinely revealed mystery truths that literally turn the hearts of the children to the pentecostal fathers so this i can't explain to you i can't overemphasize to you enough that when we don't feed on the word how can we ever come to this but we have to feed on that revealed word right because that's what's been given us in this hour and people say well you should preach this you should preach that but this is the word that's been revealed and so as you know you go on a baptist church you expect to hear baptist doctrine you go on a pentecostal church you expect your pentecostal doctrine but in a message church what do you hear well you should hear the message right the message and we shouldn't shy away from any of it if we don't understand it don't don't preach what you don't understand but there's so much we do understand there's so much that brother branham actually made clear amen now this is history and we've been over that brother man says that when he spoke is this sign of the answer he said was a prophecy he said and now this he said now it's history now it's history so you could you know if it's these divinely revealed truths that bring about the rapture why are we still here that's an honest question why are we still here well it has to be inspired to us and now i want us to look at enoch because enoch was our type and go to hebrews 11 5 again and you'll find that enoch was translated i love that word translated taken from one dimension to the other he was translated that he should not see death and was not found because god had translated him for before his translation he had this testimony that he pleased god in genesis 5 24 it tells us that enoch walked with god and he was not for god took him enoch walked now there was a time when he not just lived and then there'd come a time he knocked walk with god right and during that walk something happened during that time that brought him to a place where he could be raptured right what inspired enoch to walk with god so closely that one day he's just going about his everyday life and i believe that's how the rapture will happen by the way i think there's so much in the scripture to prove that that two will be grinding at the meal want to be taken to the other left two will be working in the field want to be taken the other left two will be in the bed want to be taken to the other left all around the world at the same time people will be changed want to be taken want to be left and and there will be there will be something that will take place that these people will be inspired to something during everyday life but see it it's not so much something and what people are looking for it said well all of a sudden i have such faith but see god's building that faith in you now and brother brahma i didn't bring the quote but brother branham talked about i think i read it here before he said how do you know that god has not already commanded someone he said an angel to come by your way and heal you how do you know that it's not already been commanded he said in today or tomorrow or at the next healing service whatever it was god's already commanded it to happen and he took that from where the ravens sped elijah and said god commanded the ravens to feed him god had already commanded it before elijah ever got to the brook before the widow before elijah ever got to the widow woman god had already commanded the widow and she didn't even know it she never even heard the message of elijah yet but she'd already been commanded to feed him and so enoch was just walking with god and then he was not because god took him but during this process in this time something happened something had to happen to change him from what he wants to rapture material now look in jude chapter 1 there's only one one chapter there jude 14 14. we find that enoch prophesied he had a message he understood something i hope you're with me today enoch understood something he didn't just you know and we take that enoch walk with god in a very literal sense so they say well you know walk with god he didn't lie he didn't steal he was perfect before god brother brown said those things he said that you know walked in such a way he never displeased god so that's part of it but look there has to be something that inspires beyond just a good life and it's one thing and and i believe that we it's essential you've heard me preach enough by now to know we have to have holiness among us we've got to live right we must live right but just living right it's not going to put you in a rapture because many people have lived right they didn't go but there's something special that happens to these at the end time and what was it to you know enoch the seventh from adam adam prophesied of these saying behold the lord cometh with ten thousand of his saints what revelation did enoch have what was his message amen the coming of the lord what was that what was the seventh seal it's the coming of the lord so you could say it this way enoch preached the seventh seal huh and under that inspiration i hope you're with me now he was the seventh from adam amed he said behold the lord cometh with ten thousand mistakes to execute judgment upon all to convince all that are ungodly among them of all their ungodly deeds which they have ungodly committed of all their hard speeches which ungodly sinners have spoken against him so now the first coming of christ and john wesley says this and i really love this statement he said the first coming of christ was revealed to adam but the second coming to enoch wesley could see this even living in that sixth age but he said the first coming was revealed to adam the second to enoch he said in the seventh from adam foretold the things which will conclude the seventh age of the world amen brother branham says it this way let's look you don't type the bride enough no one went over through the bride he went over through the tribulation period and suffered and become a drunk and died but you know walked before god for 500 years and had a testimony he pleased god with rapturing faith amen how can you please god in this hour i hope you're with me now it's impossible to please god without faith how do you please god he pleased god with rapturing faith and i prayed so many times lord i want to please you with my life i want to please you with my life i want to please you with my conduct i want to please you with my finances i want to please you with the things that i do want to please you and my family i want to please you at the church we pray prayed that way i want to please you lord i want to please you in all the little things that i do that's my desires to please god if it wasn't i wouldn't be here but enoch pleased god with rapturing faith so my prayers become as as we mature as we come to this place and in the message of the hour our prayer has to become lord help me please you with rapturing faith not just to please god by living right not just to please god by doing all these other things but to please god with rapturing faith what is that as we said how can you have rapturing faith by rapturing grace and what is it it's in the atonement amen it's in the atonement brotherhood said you have to have a revelation to receive your healing you have to have a revelation that jesus what jesus did on the cross was for you that's how you're healed that's how you're saved and how are you raptured amen by faith that the rapture is for you how because of the atonement you realize that our age if we can say it that way i don't know when it'll happen but something happens in our time that will cause us to please god with rapturing faith then the hardships don't trouble us the worries don't trouble us people falling away on every side don't trouble the bride it doesn't get to the bride why because we know that we we're going to please god there's a people that are going to be on the earth legendary that'll please god with rapturing faith amen we're going to please god with rapturing faith then what do we do now we pray for healing because we believe that god who will provide rapturing faith who is provided that will provide the faith for healing it's under the same atonement these things have been provided for us so we could say that healing if healing is under the atonement and healing is a is a down payment on the resurrection then what is the resurrection under the atonement i'm so grateful for that that all i can do is just trust his grace and feed on the word and that takes some of the worry out of it because you know i could preach in such a way that would keep everybody in church and on the edge of their seats and maybe maybe i could preach in such a way that it would control your lives in some way that while i'm keeping you from going to the dances and i'm keeping you from going to the to the bars keeping you from wearing shorts and all these things that the world does i could preach in such a way to do that just by constantly reminding you and then enforcing that and making you feel bad about it that's not gonna put you in a rapture can i can i be honest with you and i'm closing in just a moment i've always wanted a place where we could just worship god and please god and feed on the word without without all this all these politics whether somebody goes to my church or somebody else's our church or someone else's church it doesn't matter we want to please god i've always wanted a place where we could come and we could just sit under the presence of god where we could have as we talked about the logos the word and the spirit together that we could come together and we could feel the moving of the spirit where the sick could be healed and the and those that are in the world that are lost could be saved i believe we're really close to that place today i believe we're really close why because god is wanting to bring about that rapturing faith amen listen he said he pleased god with rapturing faith and just started walking right out and went up through the skies how does he walk he walks in faith here comes coronavirus the lord's coming that's still his message here comes politics the lord's coming he walks with god he doesn't get wrapped up he doesn't get walk with the republicans of the democrats he walks with god the lord's coming here comes a doctrine here and a doctrine there the lord's coming he gets hurt because he's human of course he gets hurt but the lord's coming with ten thousand of his saints enoch walked before god he kept his testimony he walked before god he stayed in the message of the hour and every step that he took he pleased god because he walked by faith he just started walking right out went up to the skies and went home without even tasting death never died at all hebrews 11 6 but without faith it is impossible to please him for he that cometh to god must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him now enoch reflected the word that he was inspired to and became that word brother branham said enoch was the living word of god of his age he was a prophet he said a prophet is god's reflector he said how many knows that the reflector doesn't reflect itself the reflector isn't a reflection there has to be something strike the reflector to make it reflect he said so a prophet is the chosen vessel of god that cannot reflect nothing at all but he's in direct line with that reflection god to reflect the image of christ the word sees that nothing else can do it you are a reflector he said that's the reason the prophet had to eat the book that's the reason he had to eat the scroll he had to reflect that word for that age amen so brother branham ties this in where a prophet would eat the book to enoch being a reflector of the word he said that's how you reflect the word is by eating the book amen he said notice enoch god's perfect reflector in type when god was through with him he just translated him took him up the mechanics that he had reflected become listen how will this happen remember i preached to you that the word and the spirit cannot be separated they cannot be separated don't let somebody tell you well it's all word or it's all it's it's together it's the same thing the logos was the spirit of god that moved on the face of the waters the word in the spirit is the same he said so the mechanics that he had reflected become dynamics amen the mechanics that he had reflected become dynamics with the spirit and took him up that's what we're waiting on today that's what we're here for today the mechanics that he had reflected become dynamics that's how you can receive your healing the mechanics that you reflected the mechanics when you begin to reflect that word back to god and say by his stripes i am healed all of a sudden the mechanics that you reflect become dynamics with the spirit and you receive your healing amen one day the rapture will be the same way revelations 10 i knew the voice which i heard from heaven speaking to me again and said go take the little book which is open the hand of the angel which stands upon the sea and upon the earth i went unto the angels and said to him give me the little book he said to me take it eat it up it shall make that belly bitter but it shall be in my mouth sweet as honey i took the little book out of the angel's hand and ate it up and it was in my mouth sweetest honey as soon as i had eaten it my belly was bitter and he said unto me thou must prophesy again before many peoples and nations and tongues and kings how did he get inspiration by eating the book how could he be inspired to prophesy again by eating the book the same way enoch did the same way john did amen how do you get inspiration for the rapture the same way that they did after the seven thunders have been revealed and they have i believe i can say that with full assurance that it had been revealed after they have been revealed eat the book hey bad listen what brother branham says and i'm closing musicians could come he said the first thing comes forth this is message calling the bride together the next thing is the resurrection of the sleeping bride he said the ones died back in the other ages are caught together he said in the trumpet the feasts and the heavens in the sky he said why that's the thing that takes place friends watch he said we're right there ready now the first thing was the message going to bride together the next was the resurrection of the sleeping bride and they're caught together in the trump and the feasts in the skies but we're right there ready now ready for what to be caught up he said the only thing the only thing the church coming out has got to lay before the sun to ripen sister sims reached her rightness she was done she went on others have said among you've reached their level of maturity they went up but we which are alive and remain we won't hinder those that are asleep but we'll be caught up together with them the dead in christ will rise first and we which are alive and remain will be caught up together with them to meet our lord in the air so he said comfort one another with these words amen brother brad said we're right there ready now the only thing the church coming out has got to lay before the sun to ripen the great combine will come by after a while the wheat will be burned the stalks but the grain will be gathered into its garner before service i had that song in my heart wins the faith if we could play that again and brother david saying this morning set your wings to the winds of faith i didn't know if we knew it well enough to sing it but you know the most striking lyric in this song is the power that makes it rises already in the skies it's already there it just takes inspiration [Music] what did he say the spirit and the bride say come hey man both the bridegroom and the bride are saying come amen that's the inspiration that the bride has to have to speak and go home it's already there we're just waiting on the inspiration to reach that level say well what do i do in the meantime you lay before the sun eat the word become that word become that word let all the greenness get out of you maybe once you would have reacted in a certain way there was a time when we could react a certain way and get all offended over certain things not no more we don't have time for that we don't have time to pray play church politics there's too much going on in the world to fight and fuss with one another to fight and fuss with other churches there's too much going on to let little things get in the way satan will come in your mind make you think well it doesn't matter it doesn't matter those demons have euphrates river it doesn't matter if i just do this it doesn't matter it's not worth it's not worth the greenness it's not worth it you've got to stay in the presence of the sun it's not worth it he'll make you think you love this or you love that or you love the other or he'll make you think you you'd be better off somewhere else you get discouraged you think well nobody cares about me nobody loves me but remember it's not worth it stay in his presence don't let coronavirus don't let anything else get you out from eating that word becoming that word because when you become the word to omnipotence mean when the inspired word of the rapture
