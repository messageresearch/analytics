[53:14] seen what I did unto the Egyptians and

[53:34] Father Lord we want to thank you for
[53:36] your grace and your mercy Lord God you
[53:39] look beyond all of our faults father and
[53:41] sin you've seen us in a condition Lord
[53:43] that we couldn't bring ourselves out of
[53:45] but you've seen the seed that you placed
[53:47] there before the foundation of the World
[53:49] Lord we want to thank you for that Grace
[53:51] Lord For The Love You bestowed to us
[53:53] tonight God lord as we come into this
[53:55] part of the service God I ask that you
[53:57] would anoint me father as I lay myself

[54:03] Heart Lord as the word comes forth
[54:05] father May there be a heart to receive
[54:06] it tonight father Lord I don't know the
[54:09] needs that are in this building father

[54:16] be met tonight Lord we ask these things
[54:18] in your precious name amen you may be
[54:21] seated if I had a simple subject tonight
[54:23] it would be carried by the message and
[54:26] this just stood out to me whenever I was
[54:28] reading this here and I like how the
[54:31] Bible puts that and Moses went up unto
[54:34] God and the Lord called unto him it was
[54:37] Moses then it uh Moses said we know the
[54:40] story how it goes he went up to the
[54:41] mountain and he did it the body his
[54:43] literal body didn't leave the Earth but
[54:46] he was still on Earth but there was a
[54:48] voice in the Lord started to speak to
[54:50] him and that this struck me we had a
[54:52] messenger on our last day that he he
[54:54] wasn't caught up he wasn't he didn't go
[54:57] to heaven or so to speak but there was a
[54:59] message that come to him and he brought
[55:01] us a message for this day and I love
[55:03] about this scripture is God is relaying
[55:06] his thoughts to Moses it ain't God
[55:08] speaking lip to ear to the children of
[55:10] Israel but God had a prophet on the
[55:13] scene and that Prophet had become the
[55:15] voice to the people and it wasn't that
[55:18] his voice was the literal voice but it
[55:20] was a voice behind the voice it wasn't
[55:22] the literal voice of Moses that was God
[55:25] but the message behind it was the voice
[55:27] of God for that day and I like how the
[55:30] Bible puts that now therefore if you
[55:32] obey my voice he was saying that there's
[55:34] a prophet on the scene there's a voice
[55:37] on the scene that is going to have my
[55:39] words that's going to have my thoughts
[55:41] that's going to have my my my my my
[55:43] ideas and if you want to succeed you got
[55:46] to come under that voice and you see
[55:48] just hearing thou voice wasn't good
[55:51] enough but they had to receive their
[55:53] voice and act upon him and I believe
[55:55] that voice was to be that direction and
[55:58] I believe God has given us a voice in
[56:00] this last day it wasn't the voice of a
[56:02] man wasn't a voice of a kentunkian but
[56:05] it was a voice to the church to the
[56:07] bride and gave them a direction you see
[56:10] that it didn't matter what the Nathans
[56:12] and the chorus were saying their focus
[56:14] had to be the voice their focus had to
[56:17] be the message and I believe that
[56:19] message had a destination before they
[56:22] was ever caught out of Egypt that
[56:24] message had a destination you look at
[56:27] Exodus 3 and 8 and I have come down to
[56:30] deliver them out of the hand of the
[56:32] Egyptians and I like how he's making a
[56:34] personal he says I ain't sending an
[56:36] angel I ain't sending uh this I ain't
[56:38] sending a man but I'm coming down
[56:41] through that man with a message and it's
[56:43] going to be me myself coming to that man
[56:46] with the same power with the same
[56:48] Authority there's a there's a quote I
[56:50] heard brother Branham say he says with
[56:52] the restoration of the word is the
[56:54] restoration of the power and I believe
[56:56] when that message come forth to Egypt to
[56:59] that people have brought an anointing
[57:01] and brought a power to the camp of the
[57:04] Israelites that they didn't have before
[57:06] but once that message come to the Earth
[57:09] come to that people there was a power
[57:11] that could break the the bands of the
[57:14] the Egyptians over their lives and I
[57:16] believe there's been a message in this
[57:18] last day that has released an authority
[57:21] it's released a power to the bride that
[57:24] it can break the bands have ideas break
[57:26] the bands of opinions break the bands
[57:28] and psychology and theology there's been
[57:31] a message in this last day that it's
[57:33] equipped us to come out of Lego to see
[57:36] you and take us into a Rapture I have
[57:39] come down to deliver them out of the
[57:42] hand of the Egyptians and to bring them
[57:44] out of that land and unto a good land so
[57:47] before there was ever out they already
[57:50] had a destination come on now and we've
[57:52] been called out of Lego to see you and
[57:54] before we was ever called out we've got
[57:56] a destination God didn't call us I'll
[57:59] just to leave us but there's a Rapture
[58:01] the goddess called you for come on
[58:03] somebody God hasn't left you here by
[58:06] yourself but God has equipped you to see
[58:08] the Rapture to see the future home to
[58:11] see that body change God has given us a
[58:13] voice in this last day to carry us all
[58:17] the way to a her destination who am I to
[58:20] bring them up out of the land into her
[58:23] good land and I believe that our future
[58:25] is based upon the focus what we focus on
[58:28] what we focus on it influences us for
[58:31] our Direction you see if you go to a
[58:34] college and you want to be a scientist
[58:36] you're not going to major in history
[58:37] because the influence of that history
[58:40] ain't going to give you the direction to
[58:43] be a scientist so what you're going to
[58:45] do is you're going to major in something
[58:47] that's going to influence want you to
[58:49] meet your destination and I believe God
[58:52] has given us a message that can
[58:54] influence us and give us a Direction all
[58:57] the way to our destination hey I don't
[58:59] believe you're going to see a Rapture
[59:00] because of Dr adoption you're not going
[59:03] to see a Rapture because of all of these
[59:05] man's ideas and opinions but God has
[59:08] given us a direction it says under the
[59:10] influence of this a message you will
[59:13] meet your destination and I believe if
[59:15] you get into this message it will
[59:17] produce such a faith for the impossible
[59:20] where we can't help but believe a
[59:22] rapture we can't help but believe
[59:24] there's going to be a body change
[59:26] there's an influence in this message
[59:28] that has equipped us with the word with
[59:31] the faith to believe it oh come on
[59:33] somebody in this a message there's a
[59:35] faith to believe that God can still heal
[59:37] God still raises the dead God still
[59:40] fills with the Holy Ghost God still sets
[59:43] free the captives this a message just
[59:45] restored it to us that we can know it's
[59:48] no longer in the book of Acts it's no
[59:51] longer just in the prophet days but it's
[59:53] right here in the middle of Hardy
[59:55] Arkansas on a Wednesday night there's a
[59:58] power that can set free illnesses
[1:00:00] there's a power Hallelujah there's a
[1:00:03] power that's been restored to the camp
[1:00:05] of Israel
[1:00:07] Hallelujah it wasn't that the Israelites
[1:00:10] was doing it in their own ability but
[1:00:12] there was a message that equips him to
[1:00:15] produce an overcoming life and this
[1:00:17] message has released the power that's
[1:00:20] equipped you to produce an overcoming
[1:00:22] life
[1:00:23] oh my it's not just for the preachers
[1:00:26] but it's for anybody that's under the
[1:00:29] voice
[1:00:30] come on now I think well we I might have
[1:00:33] said this here before but Miriam was
[1:00:35] looking at Moses and and Aaron they was
[1:00:37] put they were acting Under The Voice
[1:00:39] they was acting under the word they were
[1:00:41] calling lives here to existence there
[1:00:43] was calling frogs into existence but
[1:00:46] Miriam will look and see him high that's
[1:00:48] all great and fine but what about me
[1:00:51] that's great for Moses that's great for
[1:00:53] Aaron but what about me I'm still
[1:00:55] getting beaten I'm still being scored
[1:00:58] I'm still working under the hand of the
[1:01:00] task Masters this the message is fine
[1:01:03] but I'm still in bondage but there come
[1:01:05] a time where the authority of the
[1:01:07] message wasn't just working from Moses
[1:01:10] and Heron but there come a time where
[1:01:12] Miriam was on the other side of the Red
[1:01:15] Sea and she turned around and seen the
[1:01:17] same message that was working for Aaron
[1:01:20] that was working for for the prophet was
[1:01:22] now working for her the Egyptians that
[1:01:25] was beating her day after day the
[1:01:28] message in action for her destroyed the
[1:01:31] chains of the task Masters and the same
[1:01:33] Authority that William Branham had is
[1:01:36] the shame Authority that is in the camp
[1:01:38] of the Bride Hallelujah this third pool
[1:01:41] wasn't just for the prophet but there's
[1:01:43] a bride on Earth that's operating under
[1:01:46] the spoken word you can speak to your
[1:01:48] Mountain you can speak to the sickness
[1:01:51] that it's in your life there's a power
[1:01:53] that this a message has released to the
[1:01:55] bride Miriam didn't have nothing to do
[1:01:58] with it she just had to operate under
[1:02:01] the voice that God had given in that
[1:02:03] night and that in that day and we've got
[1:02:05] nothing to do with it there's an
[1:02:07] authority that we can come under when we
[1:02:09] when we come under the influence of the
[1:02:12] voice you see our future is based upon
[1:02:15] what we focus on brother Branham talks
[1:02:17] about Abraham Lincoln he says Honest Abe
[1:02:20] was moted by the things he read and by
[1:02:22] the things he dwelled on he says he had
[1:02:24] the Bible he has Pilgrim's Progress and
[1:02:27] he says the influences of those books
[1:02:29] produced on this day come on now and he
[1:02:32] says what's your focus on what you dwell
[1:02:35] on it influences you emote your
[1:02:37] character and I believe if there's ever
[1:02:39] a time to get away from the influence of
[1:02:42] the world it's now God's given us an
[1:02:45] influence in this day brother Branham
[1:02:46] says influence one Minister's Wife let
[1:02:49] down and did this one Minister started
[1:02:51] so and so and the rest just started he
[1:02:53] says oh my just like Josiah here he says
[1:02:55] let's let nothing influence us but the
[1:02:58] word of God let that be our influence so
[1:03:01] the word has an influence the word of
[1:03:04] the message ain't Just Books it ain't
[1:03:06] just tapes it ain't just quotes but the
[1:03:08] message is an influence come on now it's
[1:03:11] your influence but the only way it can
[1:03:14] be your influence is when you
[1:03:15] acknowledge it as your influence you
[1:03:17] look up Proverbs three and five trust in
[1:03:20] the Lord with all thy heart and lean not
[1:03:22] into thy own understanding in all thy
[1:03:25] ways acknowledge Him and He Shall direct
[1:03:27] thy path so in other words if you want
[1:03:31] him to be your direction you got to
[1:03:33] acknowledge Him in all your ways and
[1:03:35] that definition of acknowledge is to
[1:03:38] recognize the rights or the authority of
[1:03:40] so in order for him to be your direction
[1:03:43] you gotta recognize him as your
[1:03:45] Authority come on now you want this a
[1:03:48] message to lead you to a Rapture it's
[1:03:50] got to be your Authority come on
[1:03:52] somebody it's gonna be your hand it's
[1:03:54] got to be your motive it's got to be you
[1:03:56] your objectives you see I don't believe
[1:03:58] that that anything outside of this
[1:04:01] message is going to produce a Rapture
[1:04:03] and nothing happens by accident there's
[1:04:06] a message ain't going to influence you
[1:04:08] by accident but it's got to be a choice
[1:04:10] you see you don't become a bodybuilder
[1:04:13] by accident it takes some sweat it takes
[1:04:15] some tears it takes some dedication it
[1:04:17] takes some time setting aside and saying
[1:04:20] I'm going to be a bodybuilder I'm going
[1:04:22] to work for it at a rapturing faith
[1:04:24] ain't going to happen by accident it
[1:04:27] takes somebody that's dedicated to the
[1:04:29] voice and let the message start to
[1:04:32] influence you you see I don't believe
[1:04:34] that our Direction it's going to happen
[1:04:37] by accident but the Branham says and
[1:04:39] that's what the church ought to do today
[1:04:40] is look at one thing that's the voice
[1:04:43] look at one thing focus on one thing and
[1:04:47] that's the voice we've got too many
[1:04:49] people expecting to be going in One
[1:04:51] Direction but they're focusing on
[1:04:54] another Voice come on now you can't be
[1:04:56] you I can't expect to be going to
[1:04:58] Oklahoma if we're driving to Virginia
[1:05:02] come on now I can't expect whenever we
[1:05:05] left uh we left Virginia uh what was a
[1:05:07] Monday evening we couldn't be going to
[1:05:09] South Carolina and expect to be going
[1:05:11] here we needed the direction we needed
[1:05:15] something to let us know the direction
[1:05:17] we needed to go in order for us to get
[1:05:20] here we have that we have the address we
[1:05:22] had a truck we had we had gas in the
[1:05:25] truck it had a battery the thing started
[1:05:27] up fine but we needed a guide to show us
[1:05:30] how to get here come on now we you may
[1:05:32] have the Holy Ghost you may be a good
[1:05:34] Christian person but you need a guide to
[1:05:37] give you a direction to see their
[1:05:39] Rapture come on now we needed somebody
[1:05:42] to instruct us and let us know the way
[1:05:45] we're going is the wrong direction but
[1:05:48] this way is the right direction if Caleb
[1:05:51] wanted to see the promised land he
[1:05:53] needed to come under the direction of
[1:05:56] the voice and I believe that there's a
[1:05:58] direction that God has given in this day
[1:06:00] you look at Ecclesiastes hello 11-3 if
[1:06:03] the clouds be full of rain they empty
[1:06:05] themselves upon the Earth if the tree
[1:06:07] falls toward the South or toward the
[1:06:09] North in the place where the tree
[1:06:11] falleth there it shall be in other words
[1:06:14] if it's leaning this way it's not going
[1:06:16] to fall this direction
[1:06:18] come on now if it's leaning this way
[1:06:20] we're at false that's the direction it
[1:06:23] was leaning and I don't believe many
[1:06:25] people don't backslide by accidents they
[1:06:28] come under an influence brother Branham
[1:06:29] says the actor uh it fell way before the
[1:06:33] ACT took place is whenever she started
[1:06:36] to accept reasoning and I believe that
[1:06:38] many people backslide before they ever
[1:06:41] leave the church because they're under
[1:06:43] another influence but I believe there
[1:06:45] can be a bride that's Rapture Ready way
[1:06:48] before the Rapture takes place how come
[1:06:51] they're under a direction they're under
[1:06:53] and influence and that influence is
[1:06:56] pointing them to a direction we're being
[1:06:58] carried by something the Bible says
[1:07:00] where there's no vision the people
[1:07:02] perish so in other words there's people
[1:07:04] that stumbling around they're in chaos
[1:07:07] they're in confusion but at the same
[1:07:09] time but he that keepeth the law happy
[1:07:11] is here and I believe there's a bride in
[1:07:14] the midst of Chaos in the midst of
[1:07:16] confusion there's a bride that's got
[1:07:18] Vision they've got a direction they're
[1:07:20] not in the Gloom they're not they're not
[1:07:22] sad and depressed but they're happy they
[1:07:24] can rejoice in the things of God because
[1:07:26] they've got a Direction but to see in
[1:07:29] order to get a direction you need to
[1:07:31] know where to look
[1:07:33] you need to know where to look and so in
[1:07:35] order for there to be something to bring
[1:07:37] us from Virginia to here I couldn't look
[1:07:39] at my wallet and say give me a direction
[1:07:43] come on now I needed to look at the
[1:07:45] right Tank come on now I couldn't look I
[1:07:49] couldn't look at the water bottle and
[1:07:50] say give me the direction of Virginia
[1:07:52] there's nothing in this water bottle
[1:07:54] that can give me a direction and there's
[1:07:57] too many oh I hope this is okay there's
[1:07:59] too many people looking at their own
[1:08:01] ideas trying to get a direction to a
[1:08:04] Rapture there's no direction in man's
[1:08:06] ideas there's no there's no direction in
[1:08:09] man's opinions but God has given us a
[1:08:12] voice that has a direction you want to
[1:08:15] see a body change get in this message
[1:08:17] you want to see a Rapture get in this
[1:08:19] message it is the direction that God has
[1:08:22] given the bride but the brainum says
[1:08:25] that's the way it is with God's word
[1:08:27] God's word is not supposed to be learned
[1:08:30] like a newspaper story it's not supposed
[1:08:32] to be tried to be figured out it's the
[1:08:34] good down and look up to it saying God
[1:08:37] being merciful to me Give Me Faith to
[1:08:39] believe your word I like how we push
[1:08:42] that get down and look up
[1:08:45] in order to get paid you gotta look at
[1:08:48] the right place
[1:08:49] hope this is okay tonight in order to
[1:08:51] get faith in this message you gotta look
[1:08:54] at it the right way and I believe I
[1:08:57] believe that this a message is more than
[1:08:59] just ideas but it's the absolute that
[1:09:01] God has given the pride and in order for
[1:09:04] it to produce faith it needs to be
[1:09:06] looked at as the absolute
[1:09:09] come on now you can't sit there and
[1:09:11] argue with it and expect to see a
[1:09:14] rapture
[1:09:15] you can't step there and argue with it
[1:09:17] and expect it to produce Faith but in
[1:09:20] order for it to produce the right thing
[1:09:22] it's got to be operated the right way
[1:09:24] you see I was a landscaper for years and
[1:09:27] in order for me to to operate the push
[1:09:29] mower the right way I couldn't sit on it
[1:09:32] if I would on the mower and say my
[1:09:34] why aren't this thing working I can kick
[1:09:36] it I can throw it in the trash but it
[1:09:38] ain't the mower's fault it's got the
[1:09:40] ability to operate like it's supposed to
[1:09:42] but it's my fault for not operate come
[1:09:45] on somebody and in order for this
[1:09:47] message to work like it's supposed to
[1:09:48] you're going to operate it like it's
[1:09:51] meant to be operated listen message it
[1:09:53] meant to be operated like a Crete like a
[1:09:56] tradition like an idea but it is the
[1:09:58] absolute it is the direction to the
[1:10:01] pride and once it's operated like the
[1:10:04] absolute watch it starts to affect your
[1:10:07] life watch it start to affect you your
[1:10:09] home in the church you want to see a
[1:10:11] Revival in your home get into this
[1:10:14] message and let it be your absolute you
[1:10:17] want to see a Revival inside of this
[1:10:18] building get into the message get into
[1:10:21] the direction get into the absolute now
[1:10:24] watch your Revival strike like never
[1:10:25] before hey you see the devil likes the
[1:10:28] divide and conquer but once our church
[1:10:30] comes together in one Direction in one
[1:10:33] unity in one influence watch God come
[1:10:36] like never before
[1:10:38] come on now if this said this sit this
[1:10:40] side of the church has this idea and
[1:10:42] this side of the church has that idea
[1:10:44] and this right here has another idea
[1:10:46] it's not going to be going in One
[1:10:48] Direction this one's going in that
[1:10:50] direction that one's going in this
[1:10:52] direction this one's going in that
[1:10:54] direction but in order to move as a body
[1:10:56] they gotta come under One Direction
[1:10:59] come on now you want to see a church on
[1:11:01] fire come together in one direction it's
[1:11:04] not brother Ben's ideas it's not brother
[1:11:06] Ben's opinions but it's the voice that
[1:11:09] God has given that is the direction
[1:11:13] come on somebody what's the Bible say
[1:11:15] the 120 what's in the upper room in one
[1:11:18] Accord
[1:11:19] there were any Unity they had One
[1:11:21] Direction they had one go they had one
[1:11:24] purpose and once a church comes together
[1:11:26] hey it ain't the pastor don't bring the
[1:11:28] Revival
[1:11:29] come on now the church brings the
[1:11:31] Revival and he's not the church you make
[1:11:34] up the church and if you want to see
[1:11:36] Revival come under One Direction come
[1:11:39] under one influence and whenever this
[1:11:42] family is under the influence of the
[1:11:44] message this family is under the
[1:11:46] influence of the message this family is
[1:11:48] under the influence of the message they
[1:11:50] all come together and an explosion
[1:11:52] happens how come they wonder what an
[1:11:55] influence no wonder One Go they're
[1:11:57] wonder One absolute that's the message
[1:11:59] of the hour
[1:12:01] come on somebody you want a Revival come
[1:12:04] together in One Direction
[1:12:06] but you need to know where to look you
[1:12:09] want a direction you got to look into
[1:12:10] the message of the hour brother Branham
[1:12:13] says this now the hunt worldwide I've
[1:12:15] been in the wilderness and sometimes one
[1:12:17] of the best he says if you can look up
[1:12:19] and know the direction of the North Star
[1:12:22] he guides you out he says if you look up
[1:12:26] and know the direction the North Star
[1:12:28] can be there it can be Pride it can be
[1:12:30] the guide but in order but before it can
[1:12:33] guide you you've got to know the
[1:12:34] direction he says in a manner of Shame
[1:12:37] when he's lost if he can only find the
[1:12:39] North Star he can direct himself the way
[1:12:42] he's going that's when he's lost he
[1:12:44] looks for the North Star he says no
[1:12:46] other star shift but the North Star sets
[1:12:49] right in the center of the earth no
[1:12:51] matter where the Earth is turning the
[1:12:54] North Star Remains the Same
[1:12:56] he says it don't matter if the Earth is
[1:12:58] turning if it's rotating you see the
[1:13:01] courage he is constantly changing the
[1:13:03] stock market is constantly changing
[1:13:05] property value is constantly changing so
[1:13:08] we can't expect Earthly things to be our
[1:13:11] Direction but if we can get our Focus
[1:13:13] off of the things of the Earth get our
[1:13:16] influence off of Earthly things and let
[1:13:19] the left the North Star which is Christ
[1:13:21] be your influence then none of none of
[1:13:23] the other things will deteriorate but
[1:13:26] the Branham continues to say it points
[1:13:28] toward the north it's the only true star
[1:13:30] I understand though we have it's
[1:13:32] extremely the North Star it gives you
[1:13:34] your direction and he says that's what
[1:13:37] Christ is to you if you want to go to
[1:13:39] heaven if you want to be saved if you
[1:13:41] want to be filled with the spirit if you
[1:13:43] want to be christ-like so he's saying if
[1:13:45] you want a destination you got to know
[1:13:48] the direction he says Christ is your
[1:13:51] North Star if you're lost don't take a
[1:13:54] Creed he's your star he's your way he's
[1:13:57] your direction he's making a personal he
[1:14:00] the person Jesus Christ he's your
[1:14:03] direction and I believe that this
[1:14:05] message has brought Christ back into
[1:14:08] Focus come on somebody Christ has been
[1:14:11] brought back into Focus because of this
[1:14:13] message and has opened our eyes and let
[1:14:16] us know that we see Christ you see it's
[1:14:19] not that this message brought anything
[1:14:21] new it turned the way we looked at him
[1:14:23] it turned away we looked at this word
[1:14:25] you remember the story brother Branham
[1:14:27] tells of John spro he was overseas I
[1:14:30] believe in a garden and he was walking
[1:14:31] through this garden and he seen a statue
[1:14:34] and he looked up and it was Christ it
[1:14:35] was Christ on the cross on the cross he
[1:14:38] looks and he started to criticize it it
[1:14:40] says my there's no suffering it don't
[1:14:42] show the realities of the Cross but then
[1:14:45] there was a guide beside him that guide
[1:14:47] wasn't there to talk about himself that
[1:14:50] guide wasn't there to talk about his
[1:14:52] opinions that guide was in fair to point
[1:14:55] back to what he had for supper what he
[1:14:57] had for lunch but that guide was there
[1:14:59] for one purpose and that was to show the
[1:15:03] people how to look
[1:15:05] come on now and our guide our Prophet
[1:15:07] that we had in this day was here for one
[1:15:10] purpose and that was to point you to
[1:15:12] Christ and showed you how to look at
[1:15:15] this word come on now he says look
[1:15:17] there's Christ look and live look and be
[1:15:21] saved
[1:15:22] Hallelujah and that guy that God would
[1:15:25] come up to brother brow I came up to
[1:15:26] John spro and says you're looking at it
[1:15:28] the wrong way he says you need to come
[1:15:30] to this Altar and he says you need to
[1:15:32] kneel down and look up
[1:15:34] come on now you notice how he's saying
[1:15:36] that you got to come reverently
[1:15:38] you gotta push your pride aside and you
[1:15:41] gotta kneel down I think that's the way
[1:15:43] we need to look up this message come on
[1:15:46] somebody we need to we need to look at
[1:15:47] him in a way other than an opinion but
[1:15:50] it is our head and your brother Branham
[1:15:52] says once he got down and looked up he
[1:15:55] seen so much suffering that has started
[1:15:57] to break his heart he started to cry and
[1:15:59] weep he seen so much suffering that he
[1:16:02] didn't see it before because he was
[1:16:04] looking at it the wrong way but there
[1:16:07] was a guide there that showed him how to
[1:16:09] look at him and by a guide in this day
[1:16:11] has showed us how to look at the word
[1:16:13] and it has given us an Insight that we
[1:16:16] can see the realities of the Bible ain't
[1:16:19] just from the book of Acts but it's from
[1:16:21] this state God's still filling with the
[1:16:23] Holy Ghost but we needed to look at it
[1:16:26] the right way
[1:16:28] um I am so thankful we have somebody to
[1:16:31] show us how to look you remember the
[1:16:33] story of Philip in the and the eunuch
[1:16:34] the game the Bible says the angel of the
[1:16:36] Lord come to fill up and he says you
[1:16:38] need to go to is that I believe and
[1:16:40] there you're going you're going to meet
[1:16:41] somebody and the Bible says he come to
[1:16:43] Geisha and there was a eunuch the eunuch
[1:16:46] was reading the scriptures and the Bible
[1:16:48] says that Philip come up to the eunuch
[1:16:50] and says do you understand what you read
[1:16:53] and this just struck me the Bible says
[1:16:55] the eunuch looked to Philip and says how
[1:16:57] can I unless a man guides me
[1:17:00] come on he was reading scripture but
[1:17:03] could not understand him because there
[1:17:05] wasn't a guide oh but the Bible says he
[1:17:08] desired Philip to instruct him in
[1:17:11] scripture oh there was a response to the
[1:17:14] voice and I'm so glad that God placed
[1:17:17] the seed on the inside of this Pride
[1:17:20] that could respond to the voice as the
[1:17:23] God as the guide come to instruct the
[1:17:25] pride there was something responding to
[1:17:28] that instruction and the Bible says that
[1:17:31] either that Philip brought the
[1:17:32] scriptures and he was reading Isaiah 53
[1:17:34] he took the same scriptures that the
[1:17:37] eunuch was reading before but started to
[1:17:39] instruct him he started to reveal it to
[1:17:42] him and what I love about it is the
[1:17:44] eunuch stop and he looks to Philip and
[1:17:46] says is he talking about himself is he
[1:17:49] talking about a prophet is he talking
[1:17:51] about another man and Philip says he's
[1:17:53] talking of Jesus Christ and right there
[1:17:56] Revelation struck he was reading the
[1:17:59] same scriptures but he needed a guide to
[1:18:02] teach him and instruct him how to look
[1:18:04] at him come on somebody brother praying
[1:18:07] him to bring a new Bible it was the same
[1:18:09] Bible we was reading the same scriptures
[1:18:12] but we needed a guide to instruct us and
[1:18:15] give us an understanding come on now
[1:18:18] what a baptism was in the Bible the
[1:18:20] godhead was in the Bible serpent sheet
[1:18:23] was in the Bible but we was reading it
[1:18:25] the wrong way we was looking at it the
[1:18:27] wrong way but in this last day the
[1:18:30] revelations has been opened up and we
[1:18:32] can go with an understanding the serpent
[1:18:35] seat us right what a baptism is right
[1:18:37] not just these things but we know our
[1:18:40] position now come on now your name was
[1:18:43] in the book but you couldn't see it but
[1:18:45] because of the guy because of this voice
[1:18:48] because of this direction you can know
[1:18:51] that you're not Serpentine you're not a
[1:18:53] part of the tribulation Saints but sure
[1:18:56] the pride of Jesus of Jesus Christ the
[1:18:59] guide told us how to look at it
[1:19:02] come on now he told us how to look at it
[1:19:04] and say you're not a wannabe you're not
[1:19:07] a Castaway you're not just a church but
[1:19:10] you're the pride of Jesus Christ and I
[1:19:13] Proclaim tonight you're not some passed
[1:19:15] away but sure the pride of Jesus Christ
[1:19:18] that he has called and elected for this
[1:19:21] last day come on somebody I think it's
[1:19:24] time to start acting like it
[1:19:26] come on brother Branham says he's afraid
[1:19:28] that we're living below our god-given
[1:19:30] privileges
[1:19:31] God has given us a message he's giving
[1:19:33] us an open book He's giving us our
[1:19:35] inheritance but we live behold we live
[1:19:37] beyond below our privileges because we
[1:19:40] don't get into it for ourselves you see
[1:19:42] if I was in a desert somewhere and I was
[1:19:44] dying of dehydration and there was a big
[1:19:46] old jug of water sitting there in an
[1:19:49] order for me so to to get life back in
[1:19:51] my body I had to pick it up and put it
[1:19:54] into action
[1:19:55] come on now worse than that there wasn't
[1:19:57] no water there there was something there
[1:19:59] to bring back bring back life in my body
[1:20:02] and there's a message that has brought
[1:20:04] life back to the body but in order for
[1:20:07] it to produce life you gotta operate it
[1:20:10] come on now I have to pick up that chunk
[1:20:13] of water and drink it then once I put it
[1:20:16] into action it starts to bring life back
[1:20:18] to the body come on now you want a
[1:20:21] Revival you want life in your home get
[1:20:23] into the message and drink it get into
[1:20:25] the message and eat it get into the
[1:20:27] message be nosy in the message then you
[1:20:31] have plenty to talk about
[1:20:34] you'll have plenty to gossip about we
[1:20:36] can gossip about the devil all day long
[1:20:38] come on somebody we've got something to
[1:20:40] say now we got something to say with an
[1:20:43] authority
[1:20:45] we're no longer just guessing that the
[1:20:47] devil's defeated but we know it come on
[1:20:50] somebody we know it there's an authority
[1:20:52] in the bride we know it yes sir and what
[1:20:55] I love about this is the story of this
[1:20:57] uh Philip and the eunuch he stops and he
[1:21:00] says here's some water what hinderests
[1:21:03] me to be baptized and what I love about
[1:21:05] it is the Bible says there was a search
[1:21:07] in water it wasn't just an ordinary
[1:21:09] water but it was a certain place a
[1:21:12] certain time that a revelation struck in
[1:21:15] the eunuch says there's some water what
[1:21:17] hindrance me to be baptized he heard the
[1:21:21] voice he recognized it he received it
[1:21:24] now he's acting upon him come on now and
[1:21:27] this pride has heard the voice she's
[1:21:29] she's recognized that she's received it
[1:21:31] now she's acting upon him I believe
[1:21:34] every devil can be put under your feet
[1:21:36] every sickness can be put under your
[1:21:39] foot every Spirit can be put under your
[1:21:41] foot look Warmness formal Spirits lay on
[1:21:44] a sea of spirits can be put under your
[1:21:46] foot you've recognized the voice you've
[1:21:49] received the now you're acting upon it
[1:21:51] and saying there's an authority in my
[1:21:54] home there's an authority in my life
[1:21:56] there's an authority that is in the
[1:21:59] pride once again
[1:22:00] oh mama what I love about the scripture
[1:22:03] was the Bible says he opened his mouth
[1:22:05] so it was a human mouthpiece that opened
[1:22:08] his mouth but once the words come forth
[1:22:11] it was in a human voice any longer it
[1:22:14] was a human mouth but the voice that
[1:22:16] come forth wasn't human words but it was
[1:22:19] the Revelation that was equipping the
[1:22:22] eunuch to march on and we had a prophet
[1:22:25] with the human voice he opened his human
[1:22:27] mouth but once that voice come out once
[1:22:30] though the word come out it was
[1:22:32] something to equip the bride oh my so
[1:22:36] now it changed the way we looked up the
[1:22:38] word but now we have to receive it we
[1:22:41] have to act upon it brother Branham says
[1:22:43] there's a vast difference in looking at
[1:22:45] God's word and receiving God's word
[1:22:48] so we need to look at it we need to find
[1:22:50] it but once we find it we got to move on
[1:22:53] to receiving it come on somebody but the
[1:22:56] brand of continues on to say them but
[1:22:58] receive the word not them that examined
[1:23:01] it them that received their God added to
[1:23:04] the church such as be saved three
[1:23:07] thousand Souls received the word he's
[1:23:09] talking about the ones that come to
[1:23:10] Peter and says what must we do to be
[1:23:12] baptized he says repent be baptized and
[1:23:16] you shall receive the gift of the Holy
[1:23:18] Ghost and you notice they didn't stop
[1:23:20] and says that's the saith the Lord
[1:23:22] worship indication is that just your
[1:23:25] opinion is that just your idea I think I
[1:23:28] think this is just his opinion oh they
[1:23:30] realize that there was something inside
[1:23:33] of this man that was transforming lives
[1:23:35] come on now once they realize that
[1:23:38] brother Branham says they received it
[1:23:40] and once they received it their shows
[1:23:43] were added come on now you want to see a
[1:23:46] Victorious Life you gotta receive it
[1:23:49] he continues on the same he says now you
[1:23:52] can hear the word preach you can look at
[1:23:54] it and admit that attract Cain did all
[1:23:57] others did it but just where did the
[1:23:59] word fall and brought forth he says them
[1:24:01] that received it gladly was baptized he
[1:24:05] says she receiving the word and the
[1:24:08] Bible says in Acts 2 and 41 then they
[1:24:10] gladly received his words and were
[1:24:13] baptized so once they received it they
[1:24:16] put his words into action and at the
[1:24:19] same day they were added unto them about
[1:24:21] three thousand souls and they continued
[1:24:23] steadfastly in the apostles Doctrine the
[1:24:27] words steadfast means firm and
[1:24:29] unwavering so once they receive the word
[1:24:32] they become firm and unwavering you want
[1:24:35] to be you want to be a brick house you
[1:24:38] want to be firm and unwavering receive
[1:24:40] the message you know what the word
[1:24:42] receive it means to permit to enter so
[1:24:45] once you allow it to enter and make
[1:24:47] changes then you become firm and
[1:24:50] unwavering you see they had to look past
[1:24:53] all of the discouragement they had to
[1:24:55] look past all of the other ideas and
[1:24:57] opinions because they were the preachers
[1:24:59] of that day was saying he was Beelzebub
[1:25:01] Christ must be elzabeth he was a fortune
[1:25:04] teller he was this he was that they had
[1:25:06] to get past all of the other voices and
[1:25:09] received the voice that God had and I
[1:25:12] think it's time we ignore all of the
[1:25:14] other voices and receive the voice that
[1:25:17] God has you look at Romans 1 and 16 for
[1:25:20] I am not ashamed of the gospel for it is
[1:25:23] the power unto God power of God unto
[1:25:26] salvation and I believe we can say that
[1:25:28] about this message I am not ashamed of
[1:25:31] this message for it is the power unto a
[1:25:34] Rapture it's the power for a body change
[1:25:37] you may say where was the power to save
[1:25:40] the Apostle Paul from stonings and from
[1:25:42] beatings where was this power that that
[1:25:44] could keep him from the shipwrecks where
[1:25:47] was that power and this struck me the
[1:25:49] other day date because I was thinking on
[1:25:51] these things too where was that power at
[1:25:52] and it struck me it wasn't a human power
[1:25:55] that brought him through the beatings
[1:25:57] come on now at the end of the day he was
[1:26:00] peaked he was scorched he was
[1:26:01] Shipwrecked but he still said I have
[1:26:04] kept my faith that wasn't a human
[1:26:06] ability that kept the faith he realized
[1:26:09] there's a power in this gospel that has
[1:26:13] kept me through the beatings it's kept
[1:26:15] me through the stonings and I believe
[1:26:17] there's a pride that's been through some
[1:26:19] hard times you've been through some hard
[1:26:21] times you've been through some trials
[1:26:22] you've been through heartbreaks you've
[1:26:24] been through some things but you
[1:26:26] realized that I wasn't keeping this
[1:26:28] message this a message was keeping me
[1:26:31] I've been through hard times but I've
[1:26:33] got my faith
[1:26:35] I've got my faith is there a witness
[1:26:37] tonight you've been through hard times
[1:26:39] you've been through heartbreaks you've
[1:26:41] been through trials you've been through
[1:26:42] circumstances but you still got the
[1:26:44] faith that's not your ability it's the
[1:26:47] power of this a message that's been
[1:26:49] released to you
[1:26:52] it's not you keeping a hold of the
[1:26:54] message is she answered a message
[1:26:55] carrying you it's carrying you through
[1:26:59] the Red Sea it's carrying you through
[1:27:01] the Wilderness it's carrying you through
[1:27:03] the famine it's carrying you stick with
[1:27:06] the message
[1:27:07] Hallelujah stick with the message it's
[1:27:11] carrying us all the way to our
[1:27:14] destination
[1:27:15] Hallelujah
[1:27:17] we're being carried by something but in
[1:27:20] order to be carried by something you got
[1:27:22] to give up and rely
[1:27:23] come on now you got to give up and rely
[1:27:26] on what's carrying him if you're
[1:27:28] fighting against it you're not going to
[1:27:30] go anywhere
[1:27:31] come on somebody how many knows how to
[1:27:33] swim
[1:27:35] a few of you how many's ever tried to
[1:27:37] save somebody that was drowning
[1:27:39] and if they're fighting against you
[1:27:41] you're never getting anywhere you're
[1:27:43] staying in one place and you're both
[1:27:45] about to drown so in order to save the
[1:27:47] person that is drowning they got to give
[1:27:50] up and rely on your strength come on
[1:27:52] somebody you want to get somewhere with
[1:27:54] this message you gotta give up and rely
[1:27:57] on the strength of it this ain't the
[1:27:59] strength of a man this is the arm of the
[1:28:01] Lord the strength of the Lord that has
[1:28:03] been released to the bride
[1:28:06] come on somebody it's the strength of
[1:28:09] the Lord that's been released to the
[1:28:11] bride we're being carried against her
[1:28:14] remain we're being carried we're not
[1:28:16] we're not fighting against him but we're
[1:28:18] being carried by him but the Branham
[1:28:20] says When God says the Holy Ghost and
[1:28:22] knocks out a man's door and he
[1:28:24] deliberately turns it down sometime he's
[1:28:26] going to turn it down for the last time
[1:28:28] and then you won't be a privileged
[1:28:30] character you can sit in a church listen
[1:28:33] to The Gospel agree with the gospel you
[1:28:36] might do as much to say I know what's
[1:28:38] right but never put a finger on it to
[1:28:40] helping yourself see you listen to it
[1:28:43] and believe it try that's just
[1:28:45] sympathizing with it
[1:28:46] come on he says that's just sympathizing
[1:28:49] with it but we gotta go beyond them he
[1:28:52] continues on to say I could believe
[1:28:54] that's ten thousand dollars that that
[1:28:56] don't mean I've got it see I could say
[1:28:58] this is good cold water but refuse to
[1:29:01] drink it you know what I mean and this
[1:29:03] is eternal life and to refuse to do it
[1:29:06] one day you'll cross the line between
[1:29:08] judgment and mercy and you won't have
[1:29:10] the privilege to come and receive it
[1:29:13] come on now if there's something talking
[1:29:15] at your heart it's the message you're
[1:29:18] privilege not everybody has got a heart
[1:29:21] to receive it but God has given you
[1:29:23] something to receive it
[1:29:26] hey we gotta stop sympathizing with it
[1:29:28] and say it's great it's wonderful it's
[1:29:30] got It's great ideas we need to go
[1:29:32] beyond that and receiving it you know
[1:29:34] but the Bible says that the disciples
[1:29:36] come to Jesus and they say how come you
[1:29:39] speak to them in Parables and he says
[1:29:40] it's not given them to know the
[1:29:42] Mysteries but it's been given you to
[1:29:44] know
[1:29:45] there was something on the inside of the
[1:29:47] disciples that was different than the
[1:29:50] Ordinary People come on now there's
[1:29:52] something on the inside of you that is
[1:29:55] different than the Ordinary People the
[1:29:57] Baptists can't receive this the
[1:29:59] Methodist can't receive this but God has
[1:30:01] given you something to receive this word
[1:30:05] hey that was looking at Jesus and saying
[1:30:08] a parable they couldn't look past the
[1:30:10] mystery and see the Revelation the only
[1:30:12] thing they saw was a mystery the only
[1:30:15] thing they saw was a parable but the
[1:30:18] ones that had a heart to receive looked
[1:30:20] past the parable come on somebody they
[1:30:23] look past the mystery and saw the
[1:30:25] Revelation oh my the denominations is
[1:30:29] seeing a mystery you know the the High
[1:30:31] episode Gordon Lindsay would say he had
[1:30:34] the gift of Prophecy he could he could
[1:30:36] lay hands or he would touch the right
[1:30:38] hand and there'd be evaporations he says
[1:30:41] he could lay hands on the sick and God
[1:30:43] would heal them but when it come to his
[1:30:45] Doctrine he was off oh they didn't look
[1:30:48] past the mystery the only thing they saw
[1:30:51] was the parable but there was some
[1:30:53] chosen come on now the dinner just see
[1:30:56] the mystery but they looked beyond the
[1:30:58] mystery and saw my name I look beyond
[1:31:02] the mystery you've looked beyond the
[1:31:04] mystery and it's see the future home
[1:31:06] come on now you can see it with the
[1:31:09] revelation
[1:31:10] hey you can't see it if you're looking
[1:31:12] at a closed book still come on somebody
[1:31:15] John couldn't see his name as long as
[1:31:18] the book was closed but once the seals
[1:31:20] was loosed the book was open he started
[1:31:22] to shout he realized I'm no longer
[1:31:25] guessing that my name is there but I
[1:31:28] know we're no longer guessing the day of
[1:31:31] guessing is over with but a revelation
[1:31:33] has been given to you I know that I know
[1:31:37] that I know
[1:31:38] I'm not guessing any longer I know it do
[1:31:42] you know it this evening can you see it
[1:31:44] with the revelation
[1:31:45] I know it so receiving the word brings
[1:31:49] an understanding and an understanding
[1:31:51] opens your eyes to see what God is doing
[1:31:54] in this day you remember the two that
[1:31:55] walked on the road to Emmaus they was
[1:31:57] talking about Christ they were talking
[1:31:59] about a day gone by and Jesus appears in
[1:32:03] their midst it says who are you talking
[1:32:05] about and these two looked at the one
[1:32:07] they're talking about it says are you a
[1:32:09] stranger in these parts so without
[1:32:12] understanding Christ is a stranger come
[1:32:15] on somebody without this a message
[1:32:17] Christ is a stranger and so the Bible
[1:32:20] says Christ Started From The Book of
[1:32:22] Genesis the beginning of the Bible and
[1:32:24] went through all of the Bible teaching
[1:32:27] them about himself and brother Branham
[1:32:30] says he was preaching it but they
[1:32:32] couldn't understand it he says preaching
[1:32:34] don't bring understanding receiving it
[1:32:37] brings understanding they were sitting
[1:32:39] there with Christ in their midst but in
[1:32:42] order for them to seek him they had to
[1:32:44] receive it come on now Christ is Sandra
[1:32:47] Mitch the message has brought Christ
[1:32:50] back in the churches but in order to see
[1:32:53] him you've got to receive it come on
[1:32:55] somebody the Bible says that it was the
[1:32:57] evening time and Christ acted as if he
[1:33:00] was going to walk by their house and the
[1:33:02] Bible says they stop and says no come in
[1:33:05] with us and brother Branham says right
[1:33:07] there they received the word and when
[1:33:10] they received the word the pride and
[1:33:13] understanding come on now thou brought
[1:33:15] an understanding and what did
[1:33:17] understanding produce It produced a
[1:33:20] revelation you know the Bible says when
[1:33:22] Christ broke the bread their eyes was
[1:33:24] open and they saw Christ their realized
[1:33:27] that the same things that he done before
[1:33:30] he was crucified he is still doing and
[1:33:33] that's what a revelation does it opens
[1:33:36] our eyes to Noah the god of the New
[1:33:38] Testament is the god of the new and the
[1:33:40] god of the new it's the god of today
[1:33:42] it's brought an understanding that I'm
[1:33:45] not here by myself
[1:33:48] there's an anchor only in China that is
[1:33:51] holding me the ship may be tattered the
[1:33:54] bow might be about to break but there's
[1:33:55] a revelation that is holding me through
[1:33:58] every trial
[1:34:00] hallelujah we're being carried by
[1:34:02] something
[1:34:04] oh my but once their eyes was open they
[1:34:08] understood the word not just serving a
[1:34:10] God in the Tomb but our God is alive
[1:34:13] come on now our God is alive this ain't
[1:34:16] something of two thousand years ago but
[1:34:18] God is the reality this message has
[1:34:21] brought the realities of Jesus Christ to
[1:34:24] the bride
[1:34:26] oh my we're no longer guessing but it is
[1:34:28] a revelation you see receiving brings an
[1:34:32] understanding you look at Proverbs two
[1:34:34] and one my son if that will receive my
[1:34:36] words and hide my Commandments with thee
[1:34:39] so that thou can incline thy ear unto
[1:34:42] wisdom and apply their hearts to
[1:34:44] understanding so before you can hide the
[1:34:47] Commandments and kind thou we thine ear
[1:34:49] to a wisdom and apply the heart to
[1:34:52] understanding you've got to receive it
[1:34:55] come on now so before you can put it
[1:34:57] into action you have to receive it you
[1:35:00] look at Revelations 3 and 20. behold I
[1:35:02] stand at the door and knock If any man
[1:35:04] hear my voice hear my message and open
[1:35:07] the door allow me to enter I will sup
[1:35:11] with him and he with me I will
[1:35:14] Fellowship I will bring an understanding
[1:35:17] come on now this message has brought us
[1:35:19] back on talking terms with Jesus Christ
[1:35:22] once we receive it something slips out
[1:35:25] to an Unseen World brother brand of says
[1:35:27] now we can preach the word explain the
[1:35:29] word but you have to receive the word he
[1:35:32] says oh Hallelujah that's what sets in a
[1:35:34] fire brother when you receive it the
[1:35:37] Revelation slips out into an Unseen
[1:35:40] World Yonder so once you receive it the
[1:35:43] producers of Revelation what's the Bible
[1:35:45] say we walk by faith not by sight so a
[1:35:49] revelation is something that we can see
[1:35:51] we might not see with our natural eyes
[1:35:54] but a revelation it says it's there come
[1:35:57] on now Faith is the substance and the
[1:35:59] evidence of Things Not Seen it's the
[1:36:02] substance of revelation we can grab a
[1:36:04] holder and say God Is A Healer God is a
[1:36:07] deliverer God fills with the Holy Ghost
[1:36:09] even though I'm still sick her
[1:36:12] Revelation says God can heal come on
[1:36:15] somebody
[1:36:19] it slips out into an Unseen World you
[1:36:22] know brother Branham says in this
[1:36:23] building it's radio waves it's pictures
[1:36:25] either there's voices but he says you
[1:36:28] can't see it because it's in another
[1:36:30] dimension but it says you need an
[1:36:32] instrument to tap in that other
[1:36:34] dimension and bring it down to reality
[1:36:36] so right now we're just guessing that
[1:36:39] it's here we can't see the pictures we
[1:36:42] can't hear the voices but once we get an
[1:36:44] instrument that Taps into that other
[1:36:46] dimension we're no longer guessing the
[1:36:49] colors we're no longer guessing the
[1:36:51] voices but it's coming to reality and
[1:36:54] this message has produced of Faith where
[1:36:57] the brand of says in the building is
[1:36:58] your healing it's your deliverance it's
[1:37:00] the Holy Ghost but you need an
[1:37:02] instrument to tap into the other
[1:37:04] dimension and bring it into reality and
[1:37:07] that's what your faith is this message
[1:37:09] has produced such a faith that it's
[1:37:12] tapping into the Unseen World hallelujah
[1:37:16] it's tapping into the Unseen World I'm
[1:37:19] bringing healing into reality bringing
[1:37:22] the Holy Ghost into reality is bringing
[1:37:24] the Rapture into reality I might not see
[1:37:28] it with my natural eyes but a revelation
[1:37:31] says it's there a revelation says the
[1:37:34] future home is around the corner
[1:37:37] hang on to that Revelation you see who
[1:37:40] Abraham was walking by a revelation he
[1:37:43] couldn't see Jehovah Jireh with his eyes
[1:37:45] yet he was walking by Revelation he was
[1:37:47] being received the words of the Lord the
[1:37:49] words of the Lord says go and sacrifice
[1:37:51] your son he received the words and now
[1:37:54] he was acting upon him and the Bible
[1:37:56] says that he looked to his servants and
[1:37:59] says the latinine will go up and worship
[1:38:01] and we will return he was acting upon
[1:38:04] Revelation but there come a time that
[1:38:07] that Revelation becomes substance come
[1:38:10] on now he was walking up the mountain
[1:38:13] Isaac will look around and say father
[1:38:16] we've got that we've got the word we've
[1:38:18] got the fire we've got the rope and the
[1:38:20] knife but where's the sacrifice and by
[1:38:23] Revelation Abraham would say the Lord
[1:38:26] will prepare himself a sacrifice he was
[1:38:30] walking by Revelation but there come a
[1:38:32] time that that Revelation was made sight
[1:38:35] he was right there about sacrifice Isaac
[1:38:39] and he turned and looked and he seen
[1:38:41] Jehovah Jireh he seen a ram in the bull
[1:38:44] rushes his Revelation was made sight
[1:38:47] come on now right now we're hanging on
[1:38:50] to revelation of a body change better
[1:38:53] hang on to that Revelation one day it's
[1:38:56] going to be made sight something to slip
[1:38:59] into an Unseen World and we can now see
[1:39:02] it
[1:39:03] a revelation Has Lifted us up where we
[1:39:06] can see what the prophet sees you know
[1:39:09] brother Branham says the eagle swings
[1:39:10] that that Moses was talking about he
[1:39:13] says that was Moses message
[1:39:16] come on now that was Moses message that
[1:39:18] was carrying them it lifted them up and
[1:39:21] you notice that message gave Caleb a
[1:39:24] glimpse of his future Caleb was still
[1:39:26] right there in Egypt but the Bible says
[1:39:29] I'm going to bring you into a land
[1:39:31] flowing with milk and honey he wasn't
[1:39:34] there yet but that message had lifted
[1:39:37] him up where he can see a glimpse of his
[1:39:40] future
[1:39:41] Hallelujah this message Has Lifted us up
[1:39:44] where we can see a glimpse of our future
[1:39:47] a revelation says the Rapture is true
[1:39:52] Hallelujah and what I love about the
[1:39:55] story of Caleb is Caleb was so convinced
[1:39:57] of that message that it had become his
[1:40:00] own words
[1:40:01] he'd have become his own idea because
[1:40:03] the Bible says once the spies come back
[1:40:05] from the land that was giving an evil
[1:40:08] report hey the Bible says Caleb stop and
[1:40:10] he's still the people and he says he is
[1:40:12] more than able to give us the land that
[1:40:15] is Flowing with milk and honey he he's
[1:40:18] reports how to become the same report as
[1:40:21] the message come on now his report his
[1:40:25] words have become the same words that
[1:40:27] the voice was speaking years before that
[1:40:30] and our report has become the same
[1:40:33] report of this message our ideas has
[1:40:36] become the same ideas or opinions has
[1:40:39] become the same opinions we've received
[1:40:42] it let's become our Direction
[1:40:45] hallelujah it's become our Direction
[1:40:48] oh my see that's what Revelation does
[1:40:52] I was up at brother Craig Brewers last
[1:40:55] year and he's a missionary at heart you
[1:40:57] all know about the Craig here he's the
[1:40:59] missionary he's been to all of these
[1:41:00] other countries and he loves going and
[1:41:02] blazing trails and he has testimony
[1:41:05] after testimony but when we was there he
[1:41:07] wasn't the one telling us these
[1:41:09] testimonies it was his children and I
[1:41:12] was standing there as boys and his
[1:41:13] little girl was saying hey this happened
[1:41:15] one time that happened they were these
[1:41:17] kind of clothes in this country they act
[1:41:20] a certain way in that country and I
[1:41:22] started thinking and I'm sitting there
[1:41:24] and if I wouldn't have known any better
[1:41:25] I would have thought they had been there
[1:41:27] but they had never been there they was
[1:41:30] just trusting their reports of their
[1:41:32] father come on now they have so much
[1:41:35] confidence in God's report that his
[1:41:38] report had become their report his
[1:41:41] testimonies had become their testimonies
[1:41:43] we might not see the Rapture yet but we
[1:41:46] had a voice that come back with the
[1:41:48] report and I've got so much confidence
[1:41:50] that his report has become my report
[1:41:53] [Applause]
[1:41:55] his words has become my words and his
[1:41:59] authority is my authority
[1:42:03] it's something we can anchor our life
[1:42:05] upon and believe it without a shadow of
[1:42:08] doubt that it is true
[1:42:11] and brother Craig was sather just
[1:42:13] smiling he's smiling at you tell him
[1:42:15] this story tell him this one he was
[1:42:17] sitting there so proud and I'm sure God
[1:42:20] gets proud whenever he sees you in a
[1:42:22] trial but you're still speaking the
[1:42:24] message he sees you in the fiery furnace
[1:42:26] but you're still quoting the message he
[1:42:29] sees you in the Lion's Den and you're
[1:42:30] still quoting the message he gets a
[1:42:32] little happy and says oh yeah that's my
[1:42:35] children that's the chip off the old
[1:42:36] block trials gonna take it away the
[1:42:39] fiery furnace could have taken away Hard
[1:42:41] Times couldn't take it away come on now
[1:42:43] God gets a little happy whenever he sees
[1:42:46] somebody believing his report
[1:42:50] it ain't a man's report it's God's
[1:42:53] report
[1:42:54] oh my it's produced to Faith brother
[1:42:57] Branham says now don't forget to get
[1:42:59] this now Faith is designed to see what
[1:43:02] God wills and wants he says there's no
[1:43:05] knowledge I can do that faith alone is
[1:43:07] designed and give to the human race to
[1:43:10] find out what the will of God is
[1:43:14] faith is designed to see what God wants
[1:43:16] where does faith come by hearing the
[1:43:19] word hearing the word not parts of the
[1:43:21] word faith cometh by hearing and hearing
[1:43:24] the word and that's what the message
[1:43:25] brought to us was the word and that's
[1:43:27] produced of Revelation oh my you believe
[1:43:30] it tonight has brought an understanding
[1:43:32] brother Branham says now God Likens his
[1:43:35] prophecy Eagles because they go they go
[1:43:37] so high and they can see farther than
[1:43:40] any other brother Branham says that
[1:43:42] Jeremiah Isaiah and Jonathan went so
[1:43:45] high that they could see into the
[1:43:47] Millennium way before it took place even
[1:43:50] though we couldn't see it we're
[1:43:52] believing their reports thank God I'm so
[1:43:54] high that they could see into the future
[1:43:56] but then they have come back and has
[1:43:59] given us her report and because of Faith
[1:44:02] that's producing a revelation you look
[1:44:04] at Hebrews 11 and 3 through faith we
[1:44:08] understand
[1:44:09] through faith we understand not by your
[1:44:12] head knowledge not not by man's opinions
[1:44:15] but through faith we understand that the
[1:44:18] worlds were framed by the word of God so
[1:44:21] the things which are seen were not made
[1:44:23] of things which do appear you notice
[1:44:26] that the writers of the Old Testament
[1:44:27] wasn't there whenever God spoke the
[1:44:31] world into existence they wasn't there
[1:44:33] when he said let there be light they
[1:44:35] wasn't there when he said let there be
[1:44:37] trees let there be this but God lifted
[1:44:40] them up where they could see it to us
[1:44:43] and now when they bring the report back
[1:44:45] through faith we understand that the
[1:44:48] worlds were framed by the word of God
[1:44:50] it's only through faith and through
[1:44:53] faith we understand that the Rapture is
[1:44:56] a reality
[1:44:58] Hallelujah the Bible says in John
[1:45:04] they accept the man be aborted again he
[1:45:07] cannot see the kingdom of God and
[1:45:09] brother Brandon says the word see is to
[1:45:11] understand so in order to understand you
[1:45:14] have to have a faith that produces an
[1:45:17] understanding hope this is okay tonight
[1:45:19] the Bible says in Ephesians 3 and 12 in
[1:45:22] whom we have boldness and access and
[1:45:25] boldness and access with the confidence
[1:45:27] by the faith of him you look at Romans 8
[1:45:31] and 28 and we know that all things work
[1:45:34] together for the good how do we know
[1:45:36] faith has produced and understanding
[1:45:40] come on now if you can ever catch that
[1:45:42] revelation we know that all things even
[1:45:45] though when the bottom of the bottom of
[1:45:47] the fiery furnace we know with an
[1:45:49] understanding that we're not by yourself
[1:45:52] we're being carried by something brother
[1:45:55] praying them says when you really
[1:45:56] realize that God has revealed to you the
[1:45:59] truth of a thing there's nothing in the
[1:46:01] world that is going to defeat you in it
[1:46:03] what are you in you're in a revelation
[1:46:06] you're being carried by something
[1:46:09] come on now the word of God can't be
[1:46:11] defeated and if you're being carried by
[1:46:13] it that means you can't be defeated come
[1:46:16] on heavens and earth will pass away but
[1:46:19] my word will never fail so if you're
[1:46:21] anchored on the word you're an overcomer
[1:46:24] with him come on somebody if you're
[1:46:26] anchored on this message you an
[1:46:28] overcomer with it this message can't be
[1:46:30] defeated oh mine because because we know
[1:46:34] our future the things that we go through
[1:46:36] don't bother us is this okay brother
[1:46:38] being when you know your future you know
[1:46:41] it reminds me of the story that Mark
[1:46:43] loudly told one time he says that he he
[1:46:45] was on a so he was on a boat a houseboat
[1:46:48] and he says a tornado came by and his
[1:46:51] boat started to rock back and forth and
[1:46:53] he thought he was going to die he was
[1:46:54] scared he was scared to death but after
[1:46:56] it was over he comes walking out and
[1:46:59] there's boats upside down there they're
[1:47:01] they're on their side and he looks over
[1:47:03] there's some guys there says well who we
[1:47:05] made it through another one and he walks
[1:47:07] up to him and he says what's going on on
[1:47:09] guys he says well this is Tornado Alley
[1:47:12] he says this happens all the time and
[1:47:15] Mark Lowry says my if I knew I was going
[1:47:18] to make it it would be fun for me too he
[1:47:21] didn't know if he was going to make it
[1:47:22] or not but once you know the future you
[1:47:25] know you're an overcomer come on now if
[1:47:28] you know you're an overcomer the things
[1:47:30] around you won't discourage you this
[1:47:34] message has showed us our future if you
[1:47:37] know you're gonna make a Rapture the
[1:47:39] tribulation don't bother you come on
[1:47:41] somebody if you know you're the pride of
[1:47:43] Christ the sleeping virgins these other
[1:47:45] things ain't meant for you this message
[1:47:48] Has Lifted You Up On Eagle's Wings where
[1:47:52] you can see the future
[1:47:54] you can see the future the the
[1:47:57] tribulations around us it ain't
[1:47:59] bothering me
[1:48:02] we know what's so aggravating is
[1:48:05] whenever you're planning to scare
[1:48:06] somebody you're standing behind the wall
[1:48:08] over there you're just waiting for
[1:48:10] somebody to walk by and you're going to
[1:48:12] say and you're going to scare him but
[1:48:13] they're not smarter like says hey
[1:48:15] somebody's standing right there so now
[1:48:17] you jump out but that you're not
[1:48:18] startled because you know they're there
[1:48:21] come on now you know that's God of
[1:48:22] aggravate the devil when he's showing
[1:48:24] everything he's got out yet but we know
[1:48:27] we've got insights but the message of
[1:48:29] the hour knowing we're gonna make it the
[1:48:31] devil's throwing trials he's throwing
[1:48:33] circumstances he's doing hard times at
[1:48:36] you but nothing startling you because
[1:48:39] we've read the back of the book
[1:48:40] Hallelujah we've read the back of the
[1:48:43] book and we're not defeated but we're
[1:48:45] Overcomers come on now we're not in hell
[1:48:48] but we're in a rapture we know the
[1:48:51] future and when you know the future
[1:48:53] present things don't bother you
[1:48:55] president things don't bother you but
[1:48:58] it's hard to rely sometimes you know I
[1:49:00] like I'm a crazy driver
[1:49:01] I drive pretty crazy but I feel safe and
[1:49:04] secure when I'm driving but I find when
[1:49:07] the passenger seat relying on somebody
[1:49:09] else things get a little they it gets
[1:49:12] uncomfortable because you're not in
[1:49:14] control any longer yeah come on now
[1:49:16] that's why we don't like being carried
[1:49:18] by the message it's because we like to
[1:49:20] be in control I'm preaching now but once
[1:49:22] we give up and rely we're no longer in
[1:49:25] control it's not us trying to make a
[1:49:28] Rapture it's the master it's the message
[1:49:30] producing the Rapture come on now we're
[1:49:33] not trying to make a body change it's
[1:49:36] the message carrying us to the body
[1:49:38] change
[1:49:41] I'll bring this down to a close here in
[1:49:43] a minute just just bear with me a few
[1:49:44] more minutes brother Branham says faith
[1:49:46] knows no defeat faith is perfect Faith
[1:49:49] brings things when there is no things to
[1:49:52] be brought Faith creates
[1:49:55] Faith creates Faith takes doubt away
[1:49:58] takes negative and makes positive he
[1:50:01] says oh how beautiful
[1:50:03] so Faith brings things when there is no
[1:50:05] thanks Faith creates and so Faith brings
[1:50:08] a substance whenever you're sitting
[1:50:10] there in discouragement and you're like
[1:50:12] my I don't see a way out Faith creates a
[1:50:14] way out it brings a revelation it brings
[1:50:17] Christ into reality brother Branham says
[1:50:20] now look what is faith faith is a sixth
[1:50:22] sense five senses control this man God
[1:50:25] put man in five senses to contact this
[1:50:27] Earthly home you don't contact god with
[1:50:30] your five senses you know God by faith
[1:50:34] that struck me when I read that you know
[1:50:36] God it's a personal it's a personal
[1:50:38] relationship you know God by faith which
[1:50:41] is the Sixth Sense there was two senses
[1:50:43] of the Soul Faith unbelief and your
[1:50:45] possessment of faith faith is just as
[1:50:48] much of a reality as your sight is so my
[1:50:52] son will argue with you saying this is
[1:50:54] white you may say it's purple it's blue
[1:50:56] it's pink it's red it's orange but my
[1:50:58] sight says no it's a reality this is
[1:51:00] white and brother Branham says that's
[1:51:02] why faith is to the believer it brings
[1:51:05] God into reality the devil can can
[1:51:07] whisper and lie and say God don't heal
[1:51:10] God don't save God God don't set free
[1:51:12] but faith says it's a reality I don't
[1:51:15] care what you say nothing's going to
[1:51:17] detour me we're packing something that
[1:51:20] is that is produced a revelation but the
[1:51:23] Branham says and God
[1:51:26] says what was it Moses was his messenger
[1:51:30] Moses and the eagle
[1:51:32] they were carried on because he was
[1:51:35] packing God's message he was packing
[1:51:38] God's message and here's the brother
[1:51:40] Branham says here a true voice of God
[1:51:42] only brings back the real living
[1:51:44] Supernatural god with their Supernatural
[1:51:47] word the supernatural manifestation of
[1:51:51] the true word so the message that Moses
[1:51:54] had was equipping Caleb to manifest the
[1:51:57] supernatural word for that day see Caleb
[1:52:01] when he got to the promised land Caleb
[1:52:03] started to manifest what the voice said
[1:52:05] years ago he he wasn't there by his own
[1:52:09] ability his own power but there was
[1:52:11] something that brought him that far you
[1:52:14] notice Caleb didn't have to worry about
[1:52:16] speaking why speaking Manna Out of
[1:52:19] Heaven he didn't have to worry about
[1:52:21] bringing water out of the rock he didn't
[1:52:23] have to worry about having shoes on his
[1:52:25] feet it was the message that equipped
[1:52:28] the water it was the message that
[1:52:30] brought Mana it was the message that
[1:52:32] kept shoes on their feet the only thing
[1:52:35] he had to do was rely he had a spiritual
[1:52:39] insight and you see that inside brought
[1:52:41] him to a reality look at numbers 14 or
[1:52:44] 24 but my servant Caleb because he had
[1:52:47] another spirit with him and has followed
[1:52:50] me fully that struck me followed me
[1:52:53] fully this is God speaking he wasn't
[1:52:55] following a man but the message that he
[1:52:58] brought God gave was God what if he was
[1:53:02] pounding
[1:53:09] he went and his seed shall possess it
[1:53:13] his seed wasn't Overcomer because he
[1:53:16] followed the message fully
[1:53:18] you want to see your children and people
[1:53:21] follow the message fully you see the
[1:53:24] children's children
[1:53:26] could sit at home that night and say my
[1:53:29] this is wonderful we're on our Promised
[1:53:31] Land the Giants are being defeated and
[1:53:34] they can look back into a father and say
[1:53:36] thank you you follow this message Fuller
[1:53:40] will you put me in an atmosphere where
[1:53:42] the Giants had to fall you put me in an
[1:53:44] environment where I could possess that I
[1:53:47] could possess the promised land and I'm
[1:53:49] so grateful that they're still parents
[1:53:51] in this day that is following God fully
[1:53:54] and is equipping their children
[1:53:57] as the musicians come
[1:54:00] we're being carried by something and
[1:54:02] that's my last point I hope this is okay
[1:54:04] tonight brother Branham tells the story
[1:54:07] about uh Paul Rader I believe he was the
[1:54:10] preacher of Divine Healing and brother
[1:54:12] Branham says he got sick and he got a
[1:54:15] fever and he went into a coma
[1:54:17] and in this coma he had a dream and in
[1:54:20] the Stream he was a logger and brother
[1:54:22] Branham says he they were way up in the
[1:54:24] mountains and his boss says go up to the
[1:54:26] mountain cut down that log and bring it
[1:54:29] down here and brother Branham says he
[1:54:31] goes up there he cuts down the log and
[1:54:33] he tries to pick it up he tries to pick
[1:54:35] it up but he can't do it
[1:54:37] and brother Branham says rap there he
[1:54:39] spelled down and he starts to cry he
[1:54:41] says mile why would my boss tell me to
[1:54:43] do this
[1:54:53] he
[1:54:56] turns around to see
[1:54:59] they ain't his boss but a truck he says
[1:55:04] brother Brandon
[1:55:07] into the water he jumps on him and he
[1:55:10] rides it all the way to the camp saying
[1:55:12] I'm riding on it I'm writing on it I'm
[1:55:15] writing going brother Brandon says he
[1:55:16] wakes up saying I'm riding on it I'm
[1:55:19] right ain't gonna rap there God heals
[1:55:21] him and brother Branham says the log
[1:55:23] represents the gospel he says we can't
[1:55:26] do it by yourself but he says just write
[1:55:28] on it
[1:55:29] brother random says this that's what the
[1:55:31] church denomination has done today wore
[1:55:34] themselves out tugging up this tugging
[1:55:35] at them trying to do this trying to do
[1:55:37] that he says turn loose and let God do
[1:55:40] it that's the thing let God do it it's
[1:55:43] too much for you anyhow
[1:55:46] it's too much for you anyhow you see
[1:55:49] it's not us trying to make a Rapture but
[1:55:51] it's us riding on we can't produce this
[1:55:57] trying to
[1:55:58] make they've tried making this and
[1:56:00] making that but God has equipped you to
[1:56:02] jump aboard this message and it will
[1:56:05] produce it brother Branham says brother
[1:56:07] sister Jesus Christ
[1:56:09] these things have happened in the last
[1:56:10] day believe that we're living here
[1:56:15] I don't know how it's happened but I'm
[1:56:18] riding on
[1:56:19] but it's the truth because that's the
[1:56:22] gospel
[1:56:23] he says I believe it is
[1:56:27] hiding
[1:56:39] with me why don't you jump on this
[1:56:42] message with us it's the direction for a
[1:56:45] Rapture it's the direction for a body
