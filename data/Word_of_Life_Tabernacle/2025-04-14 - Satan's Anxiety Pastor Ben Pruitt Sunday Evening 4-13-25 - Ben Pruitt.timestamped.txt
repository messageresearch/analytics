[11:36] [Applause]
[11:39] Let's try that song. I've got a
[11:46] revelation. I've got a
[11:49] [Music]
[11:50] revelation of
[11:54] predestination. I've got
[11:57] a
[11:58] revelation. God is my father.
[12:03] He tells me
[12:05] where I came from. Tells me
[12:09] where I'm going. And the gates of hell
[12:15] will never prevail
[12:18] against. Sing it again. I've got
[12:22] [Music]
[12:24] a
[12:27] predestination. I've got a
[12:31] reation. God is my
[12:34] [Music]
[12:35] father. It tells me
[12:38] where I came from. Tells me
[12:42] where I'm going. And the gates of hell
[12:48] will never prevail against. Let me hear
[12:51] you singing once again.
[12:56] [Music]
[13:10] tells me
[13:12] where I came
[13:14] [Music]
[13:16] from. I'm
[13:19] going of hell will never prevail
[13:25] against me.
[13:28] Even same key. One
[13:32] [Music]
[13:36] day, some days I think of the day I'll
[13:43] die. Some
[13:47] [Music]
[13:50] days one day
[13:53] Jesus will call my name. Oh, one day
[13:59] Jesus will call my
[14:02] name. As days go by, I hope I don't stay
[14:13] the
[14:16] change. You looking forward to that day.
[14:20] [Music]
[14:22] Most days I
[14:25] prayed, some days I hurt. A sad number
[14:30] of days I have put myself
[14:34] first. It's not what I
[14:37] do. The cross made that plain. Oh, and
[14:42] one day
[14:44] Jesus will call my name. Oh, one day
[14:50] Jesus will call my
[14:53] name. As days go by, I hope I don't stay
[15:04] the
[15:07] change. Let's sing that chorus to him
[15:09] once again.
[15:11] calls my name. Oh, one day
[15:15] Jesus will call
[15:19] my days go by. I hope I don't stay the
[15:25] same. I want to get so close to him.
[15:29] It's no big change on the day that
[15:35] Jesus calls my name. Can we give the
[15:39] Lord a hand clap of
[15:40] [Applause]
[15:44] praise? Let's sing a song. Brother
[15:46] Robert, I didn't see it in there. Where
[15:47] could I go? Leaving below in
[15:50] this. Okay. Well, it's under Thank God
[15:54] I'm free on mine. So, I don't know.
[15:56] Amen. Let's sing a song. Key of G. We'll
[15:58] sing this just before we have the ushers
[16:00] come tonight.
[16:02] Living
[16:05] below in this old sinful
[16:10] world. Hardly a comfort can
[16:16] [Music]
[16:18] afford.
[16:19] Striving
[16:21] alone to face temptation.
[16:24] [Music]
[16:27] Where could I go to
[16:33] the singing? Where could I
[16:37] go? Oh, where could I go?
[16:43] Seeking a refuge for my
[16:48] [Music]
[16:50] soul and needing a
[16:54] friend to help me in the
[16:58] end. Where could I go but to the
[17:06] Lord? Neighbors are
[17:10] kind. I love them.
[17:13] [Music]
[17:14] Everyone we get along in sweet
[17:19] [Music]
[17:23] accord. But when my
[17:26] soul needs man from
[17:31] above, where could I go but to the Lord?
[17:39] And where could I
[17:42] go? Oh, where could I
[17:47] go? Seeking a refuge for my
[17:54] soul
[17:56] and a
[17:58] friend to help me in the end.
[18:03] Where could I go but to the Lord? Last
[18:10] verse. Life here is
[18:14] grand with friends I love so
[18:19] dear. Comfort I get from God's own word.
[18:27] Yet when I
[18:30] face the chilling hand of
[18:34] death, where could I go but to the Lord?
[18:40] As the ushers come, we're singing
[18:44] where
[18:47] I could
[18:50] go seeking a refuge for my soul.
[18:59] and needing a
[19:02] friend to help me in the
[19:06] end. Where could I go but
[19:10] to the
[19:14] Lord? Amen. He's the the friend that
[19:17] sticks closer than our brother. Amen.
[19:19] Amen. If you just want to play something
[19:21] softly. Amen. We don't have any written
[19:24] uh prayer request.
[19:26] uh this evening. Um but we got a a
[19:29] praise report from Sister
[19:31] Esther. Uh it says, "At camp, I went to
[19:33] the altar to pray with my friends and
[19:35] found myself praying for more of God."
[19:38] And while uh she was praying for that in
[19:39] her head, a preacher come by and said,
[19:41] "Fulfill her desire for more of you."
[19:44] And a piece just came over our sister
[19:46] Esther there. So we just want to give
[19:47] the Lord a hand clap of
[19:49] praise. We know that. Amen. when
[19:53] we, you know, we know that God works in
[19:56] in mysterious ways and when we we yield
[19:59] oursel to him and we just connect with
[20:01] his spirit, just amazing things can
[20:03] happen. Amen. And if you have an
[20:05] unspoken request, if you just like to
[20:06] make it known by the uplifting of your
[20:07] hand, we'll ask our brother Stewart take
[20:10] these needs for
[20:11] us by our hearts. Lord, we love you
[20:14] tonight. Lord, we just come before your
[20:16] throne of mercy and grace, Lord. and you
[20:18] see the needs of your children here
[20:20] tonight, every heart, Lord. Lord, may
[20:22] you just pour out your spirit upon every
[20:24] life, Lord, upon every need. Lord, may
[20:26] we just look away from this world and
[20:28] look away to Jesus here this evening.
[20:31] Lord, we just thank you for the
[20:32] testimony of our sister and just the
[20:34] move of God upon her life, the peace
[20:36] that you brought. Lord, won't you just
[20:37] come and move among us here tonight?
[20:39] Every heart, every life, just use our
[20:42] brother Ben to minister the word. Or may
[20:44] we just be able to enter in tonight and
[20:46] receive what you would have for us.
[20:47] Lord, we love you. We just ask you bless
[20:49] the tithes and offerings now in the name
[20:51] of Jesus Christ, we
[20:53] pray. Amen. You can be seated as the
[20:55] ushers come. Lord, I surrender my
[21:02] life. I give it all to you.

[42:13] you today to meet all of our needs. And
[42:16] we thank you for doing it, Lord. Lord,
[42:19] as we've even heard the testimonies of
[42:21] how you speak to us, Lord, personally, I
[42:23] pray, God, that you'd do it again
[42:25] tonight. Speak to us, Lord. Lord,
[42:28] there's a need in our heart somehow, or
[42:31] maybe something we've been struggling
[42:32] with, a question that we have. I pray,
[42:34] God, that you'd meet that need tonight.
[42:36] Move me out of the way, Lord. I know I'm
[42:38] insufficient in myself, Lord, to bring
[42:40] your word, but I know that you are able,
[42:43] God. We thank you for your presence here
[42:45] with us. We pray you continue to be with
[42:47] us throughout the service. We pray in
[42:50] Jesus name.
[42:52] Amen. Amen. Thank the
[42:56] Lord.
[42:58] Hallelujah. Just love the Lord this
[43:02] evening. If you

[43:09] verse. Give you just a moment to turn
[43:11] there. You want to mark it in your
[43:13] Bible. James chapter 2 verse
[43:17] 19. What a blessing to be in the house
[43:20] of the Lord with all of you today. So
[43:22] thankful to be one of his. Aren't you?
[43:25] Amen. I'm glad I can say I'm one of
[43:27] them.
[43:30] Amen.
[43:34] Amen. Giving y'all time to turn. I
[43:37] needed time to
[43:40] turn. James chapter 2 verse 19.
[43:43] Thou believest that there is one God.
[43:47] Thou doest well. How many believe
[43:48] there's one God?
[43:50] But he says the devils also believe. But
[43:53] I want you to take special note of the
[43:55] last line. They believe and
[43:59] tremble. I want to speak to you tonight
[44:01] on the devil's
[44:03] anxiety. Devil's anxiety. You may have
[44:06] your seats.
[44:09] I think anxiety is probably the sickness
[44:12] of our
[44:13] age.
[44:15] It's a definition of anxiety is feeling
[44:18] nervous, restless,
[44:20] tense, having a sense of impending
[44:23] danger,
[44:24] panic. Oh, I just love to believe that
[44:27] the devil's panic
[44:29] tonight. Or
[44:31] doom. Having an increased heart
[44:34] rate, breathing rapidly or
[44:36] hyperventilating, sweating,
[44:39] trembling,
[44:41] trembling, feeling weak or tired and
[44:43] trouble
[44:45] concentrating, having trouble sleeping,
[44:47] stomach problems, having difficulty
[44:49] controlling worry, or having the urge to
[44:52] avoid things that trigger
[44:55] anxiety. Rates of anxiety have doubled
[44:57] over the last 10 years among people,
[45:00] just people in the world. They're
[45:01] increasing even faster in young people,
[45:04] which doesn't make any sense. What do
[45:06] young people have to be anxious about?
[45:08] We've talked about that before, but we
[45:10] know that's a prophesied symptom of the
[45:12] end times. In Luke 21:2, it says, "There
[45:15] shall be signs in the
[45:17] sun and in the moon and stars upon the
[45:20] earth, distress of nations with
[45:22] perplexity, sea and the waves roar." In
[45:24] other words, they won't know what to do
[45:26] about the natural disasters and things
[45:28] that are happening. Verse 26, men's
[45:31] hearts failing them for fear and for
[45:35] looking after that means being anxious
[45:37] about those things which are coming on
[45:40] the earth for the powers of heaven shall
[45:43] be shaken. Brother Brandham says
[45:46] traveling around from nation to nation I
[45:48] find that everyone seems to be nervous
[45:51] and the psychwards are filling up and
[45:53] the people are down the street. He said
[45:55] there seems to be so much anxiety and a
[45:57] rush just as hard as they can till they
[46:00] don't have courtesy even one for the
[46:02] other. We talked about courtesy a while
[46:04] back. That's actually a fruit of the
[46:06] spirit. Something God wants to see in
[46:08] our lives is courtesy for one another.
[46:10] And brother Brandon types that to being
[46:12] or or ties that to being anxious that
[46:15] people don't have courtesy because
[46:17] they're so anxious about things and in a
[46:19] rush. He said, "I've noticed it amongst
[46:21] all people." I think if we look around,
[46:24] you know, we know the world's getting
[46:25] worse, but I think it's also worse
[46:27] because our anxiety about it is worse.
[46:30] We think more about it. And I I think
[46:32] about these storms that just happened. I
[46:34] I I my mind goes back as a kid, you
[46:37] know, as you get old, you start talking
[46:38] about yourself as a kid. Have you ever
[46:40] noticed that? I've noticed older
[46:42] preachers, they start telling stories
[46:44] about themselves. I'm I'm trying not to
[46:46] do that, church, but I'm 39. and I'm I'm
[46:48] I'm about to go over the hill and this
[46:51] summer and uh as I get older, I find
[46:54] myself thinking about it as a child and
[46:56] we never knew if a storm was coming till
[46:58] they announced it on the radio 30
[47:00] minutes before if we happened to be
[47:02] listening, you know, and you just didn't
[47:04] know those things. And now we know days,
[47:06] weeks, months ahead of time, and we're
[47:08] watching weather patterns and
[47:09] everybody's all upset and and I'm not
[47:11] saying we don't have a right to be. I'm
[47:13] just it's just something that happens
[47:15] because we have so much understanding,
[47:17] so much knowledge about what's going on
[47:20] and it probably saves people's lives,
[47:21] but it also increases our anxiety about
[47:24] what's going on and and everything's
[47:27] worse. Brother Ram said, "The whole
[47:28] world, did you ever see the lack of
[47:29] nervousness? Just let me tell you,
[47:32] Eevee," he said, "Every night when I've
[47:33] been here, I watch the audience." He
[47:35] said, 'Now each one, I want every man
[47:37] and woman to be sincere with me, feeling
[47:39] the
[47:40] pressure. When nervous people come to
[47:42] this platform, there's at least right
[47:44] now in this building, 80% of what's
[47:46] sitting here is nervous, affected with
[47:48] nervous trouble. He said the Bible said
[47:51] men's heart failing, more heart
[47:52] troubles, number one disease. Is that
[47:54] right? And fear, sights upon the earth,
[47:56] perplexed with time, distress between
[47:57] nations, and all these things just
[47:59] before the coming. He said it's setting
[48:00] a stage for the greatest drama that was
[48:03] ever acted out in all ages, the coming
[48:06] of the Lord Jesus Christ. He talked
[48:08] about how a lamb is nervous when a lion
[48:11] is nearby and the world was nervous
[48:13] because the end times were were coming
[48:15] and were on the earth. By 1961, the rate
[48:19] had gone up. Brother Brandham in that
[48:20] first quote said that 80% of the people
[48:23] were nervous. And this one he said,
[48:24] "Sister, of course, one of the great
[48:26] things wrong with you, we all know, but
[48:27] this one thing he said there's about 95%
[48:30] of this audience suffering with the same
[48:32] thing, a nervous condition." So, we see
[48:35] an increase in nervousness. Why is that?
[48:38] Satan is nervous.
[48:40] I want to I want to turn this around
[48:42] because I don't want to talk tonight so
[48:43] much about our anxiety as I want to talk
[48:46] about Satan's anxiety. The Bible says,
[48:49] did you catch that? He believes and
[48:52] trembles.
[48:55] He trembles.
[48:57] What does that mean? It means he's
[48:59] anxious. He He's worried. He's nervous.
[49:05] No wonder the world's shaking because
[49:07] Satan, the prince of the power of the
[49:09] air, is nervous.
[49:12] And he has a right to be. See, the
[49:15] devils believe and and tremble. Why? Why
[49:18] is he nervous? He's nervous because he
[49:21] knows the word of God. He's a student of
[49:24] it and he believes it,
[49:27] right? He believes it. Revelation 12:7.
[49:30] You know, Satan has read this.
[49:34] He was there when John was writing it.
[49:36] He was one of the first to read it.
[49:40] Look, he said, "There was war in heaven.
[49:43] Michael and his angels fought against
[49:45] the dragon. The dragon fought in his
[49:46] angels and prevailed not. Neither was
[49:48] their place found anymore in heaven. He
[49:51] experienced this.
[49:53] Satan did. Now, think about it for a
[49:56] minute. He He knows he has firsthand
[49:58] knowledge of the power of God because he
[50:02] says the great dragon was cast out, that
[50:04] old serpent called the devil and Satan
[50:06] which deceiveth the whole world. He was
[50:08] cast out of the earth and his angels
[50:10] were cast out with him. Now this
[50:13] happened, brother Brandon said the first
[50:14] thing in heaven was a battle. Lucifer
[50:16] was kicked out and come to the earth.
[50:17] Then he polluted Eden, he said. Then
[50:19] he's been polluting ever since. And now
[50:21] from the battle in heaven is coming to
[50:23] the battle on earth. And it is to be
[50:25] finished on earth at the end time in a
[50:28] battle called Armageddon. Satan can read
[50:31] that just like you and I can read it. He
[50:34] can hear that just like you and I can
[50:35] hear it. And he knows that it's true.
[50:39] Revelation 12:10 said, "I heard a loud
[50:41] voice sing in heaven." Can you imagine
[50:44] how anxious, how nervous. Have you ever
[50:46] been in church and been nervous?
[50:48] Yeah. Now, think about it. You've been
[50:51] in church, you've been nervous. Maybe
[50:52] you're in a Have you ever been in a
[50:54] church maybe where you're not sure
[50:55] what's being preached is really correct?
[50:58] Well, that's nerve-wracking, isn't it?
[51:00] It's anxious. I hope you're not that way
[51:01] right now. But, but it just it just
[51:04] makes you nervous because you're not
[51:06] sure what's going going on. Maybe you're
[51:08] in a church, you don't know the pastor,
[51:09] you don't know the preacher, and and you
[51:11] don't know where he's going. And so,
[51:13] there's a nervousness to that. And I've
[51:14] watched people over the years that if I
[51:16] have somebody in, maybe they've never
[51:18] heard before, I try to be here because
[51:20] people watch the pastor. They'll try to
[51:22] look and see, well, is the pastor
[51:24] agreeing with it? You know, because you
[51:26] don't want to take in anything that's
[51:27] wrong. You get nervous. Let me tell you,
[51:29] the most nervous person that's in here
[51:31] when the word is being preached is the
[51:33] devil. And he's not nervous about false
[51:36] doctrine. He's nervous about real
[51:37] doctrine about the truth. He gets
[51:40] nervous when the when the presence of
[51:42] God is there. He gets nervous. Have you
[51:44] ever wondered why kids will start
[51:45] getting really upset and start crying
[51:47] and want to and disruptive? Why do they
[51:49] do that during the preaching of the
[51:51] word? Because the devil gets nervous and
[51:53] them kids aren't the devil, but they can
[51:55] feel that they that atmosphere is there.
[51:59] Are you with me so far? So, the devil
[52:02] gets nervous. Now, watch. He I heard a
[52:06] loud voice saying in heaven, Revelation
[52:07] 12:10, now is come salvation and
[52:09] strength and the kingdom of our God and
[52:11] the power of his Christ. For the accuser
[52:13] of our brethren is cast down, which
[52:17] accused them before our God day and
[52:18] night. Satan is getting preached
[52:21] that all the time, called out by name in
[52:27] church, and it makes him nervous because
[52:30] he knows it's true.
[52:33] Now look, and they overcame him.
[52:35] Hallelujah. I love how it puts it in the
[52:37] past tense here. They overcame him by
[52:39] the blood of the lamb. It was a prophecy
[52:42] that's become a history in our lives.
[52:44] They overcame him by the blood of the
[52:45] lamb and by the word of their testimony.
[52:48] I love the fact that we're seeing
[52:49] testimonies come across the pulpit. We
[52:51] want to see more of that because that's
[52:53] how you overcome the devil is by the by
[52:55] the word of your testimony. And they
[52:58] love not their lives unto the death.
[53:01] Therefore, rejoice ye heavens, ye that
[53:03] dwell in them. Woe to the inhabitants of
[53:05] the earth and of the sea. For the devil
[53:09] has come down unto you, having great
[53:14] wrath, because he
[53:17] knows, he knoweth that he hath but a
[53:22] short time.
[53:25] He's
[53:27] angry. He's more angry than you are when
[53:30] your wife makes you
[53:34] late. He's more angry than than you can
[53:37] even hardly imagine or fathom. Satan is
[53:41] literally having a
[53:42] fit. We Come on, church. We don't like
[53:46] to think. We like to think about the
[53:47] devil great all powerful thing and well,
[53:49] he just made me do it. You know, I
[53:51] couldn't help it and he just kind of,
[53:53] you know, just a devil, man. if he just
[53:55] would leave me alone, I'd be okay. Well,
[53:58] the Bible says, "Greater is he that is
[54:00] in you than he that is in the world."
[54:03] And at some point, we're going to quit
[54:05] making excuses and say, "Lord, I know
[54:07] you're greater." The devil's already
[54:08] worried that one day you'll wake up and
[54:10] realize who you are. That you are the
[54:12] bride of Jesus Christ. That you are the
[54:14] elect of God. You know why he's always
[54:16] telling you you can't make it? But
[54:17] Elena, he's always telling you that
[54:19] you're not good enough or you can't make
[54:20] it because he knows better. He knows
[54:22] you're going to make it. He knows you're
[54:24] going to be there. He knows that. He
[54:26] knows that you c you're going to cast
[54:28] him out. He knows that you're going to
[54:29] put your foot on his neck. He knows
[54:31] that. He He got a better revelation of
[54:35] it than many of us. He knows it. And if
[54:37] you could ever discover that, if you
[54:39] could ever recognize I'm going to make
[54:40] it. I'm going to be there. I'm a child
[54:43] of God. No matter what the devil does,
[54:46] he can't keep me out of heaven because
[54:48] he's done been kicked out of heaven.
[54:51] Glory to God.
[54:55] Satan's having a fit.
[54:58] Because he
[54:59] knows. Amen.
[55:02] How does he know? The same way we
[55:05] know. Say, see now, Satan can't read
[55:08] your mind. You know that he can't know
[55:09] your heart. That's right. Do you know
[55:11] that?
[55:13] Brother Brandham says, "If I'm planning
[55:14] on doing something," he said, "I know
[55:15] better than to tell anybody about it."
[55:18] Not that that person would tell it, but
[55:19] Satan will hear it. He can't get it in
[55:22] my heart as long as God has got it
[55:26] closed up with the Holy Spirit. So
[55:28] that's between me and
[55:30] God. He don't know nothing about it
[55:33] until you speak it and then he hears it.
[55:39] So he sits there. Can you imagine
[55:41] Satan sitting there waiting to see if
[55:43] the seals would be revealed?
[55:46] Got his notepads, you know.
[55:50] Oh no, he
[55:52] says and brother Brandham starts to
[55:55] preach and tell about that white horse
[55:57] rider. Can you imagine what that must
[55:58] have made him feel like when brother
[56:00] Brandham said I was about to make an
[56:02] awful
[56:03] mistake but he said the Lord come to me
[56:06] the angel come to me and told me what it
[56:08] was and he said it wasn't what I
[56:10] preached before that it was uh it was
[56:13] Christ with a on a white horse. He said
[56:15] but this is the antichrist. And the
[56:17] devil's like, "Oh,
[56:19] no." You imagine how nervous he got.
[56:22] What if these people
[56:24] realized, "Oh, church. What if they
[56:27] realized that denomination come from me
[56:30] that I I I created all this stuff or or
[56:32] I or I deformed all of this, the church,
[56:35] into a denomination, and I I've I've
[56:38] caused all of this. What if they found
[56:40] out that they're free? What if they
[56:42] found out, church?" I believe he's
[56:44] anxious tonight because I believe
[56:46] there's some people about to find out
[56:47] that they're free. I believe there's
[56:48] some people that are going to find out
[56:50] one day that I'm not bound by a
[56:52] preacher. I'm not bound by a church. I'm
[56:53] not bound by a denominational system.
[56:55] I'm not bound by drugs and alcohol. I'm
[56:58] not bound by the things of the world.
[56:59] I've been freed by the blood of the
[57:01] lamb. And Satan is anxious right now
[57:03] because he knows if you find that out,
[57:05] he's in trouble.
[57:10] I just imagine him hearing that for the
[57:12] first time. said, "Oh
[57:15] no. Oh no." They found out it was
[57:20] me. Brother Brandon said, "You don't
[57:22] know nothing about it till you speak
[57:23] it." And then he said, "I watch the
[57:26] devil cut off every will he can to get
[57:28] there to beat me to it. But if I get the
[57:29] revelation from God, just don't say
[57:31] nothing about it." Then it's different.
[57:32] That's why Brother Brown is so cautious
[57:34] in the seventh seal. And he says it
[57:36] won't be revealed to the public until
[57:37] that time. And then he goes out and the
[57:41] seven seal is manifested and proved in
[57:43] brother Brandham's ministry in in in in
[57:46] his remaining sermons. And people say,
[57:48] "Well, he just never never preached it,
[57:50] never did it." No, there's one thing we
[57:51] don't know. That's the day and the hour.
[57:53] Right? That's all we don't know. But
[57:55] everything else we know, if anybody
[57:58] knows the seals are open, Satan does.
[58:01] That's why he tries to tell people that
[58:02] they're not.
[58:04] If anybody knows the word has been
[58:05] revealed and the book has been open,
[58:07] Satan does.
[58:09] He realizes how much trouble he's in
[58:12] because he was cast out of heaven and
[58:14] now he knows he has but a short time.
[58:17] So, so he's walking around in his Eden
[58:21] having a nervous fit waiting for the
[58:25] rapture of the church cuz the part that
[58:28] we don't know, he don't know.
[58:32] Amen. You think that keeps him up at
[58:34] night? I don't know if a devil sleeps. I
[58:36] guess he don't have to, but can you
[58:38] imagine how much worry there must be in
[58:41] his mind because he don't know, brother
[58:43] Stewart, he don't know. He realizes a
[58:45] lot more than most people that that it's
[58:47] all done except for the resurrection
[58:49] that we're just waiting on the
[58:50] resurrected saints and he knows that.
[58:52] And so he's watching and he's waiting
[58:54] and he's looking for it. But oh my, but
[58:56] he won't even see it. It'll it will just
[58:58] disappear. He won't know till we're
[59:00] gone. Glory to God.
[59:03] Hallelujah. But but he he's waiting on
[59:06] it. He's
[59:09] anxious. See, the word of God is a
[59:11] discerner of the thoughts intents of the
[59:13] heart. Satan is not. Satan can't do
[59:16] that. But he does study the word and
[59:20] he's anxious because he is a student of
[59:22] the scriptures. Brother Brandham tells
[59:24] us now not to know the Bible is life.
[59:27] Although it's wonderful to know the
[59:28] Bible, but did you know Satan was a
[59:30] Bible student? He said he proved it in
[59:32] the debate with our Lord. He was good.
[59:34] And to know the Bible is not life. To
[59:35] know your catechism is not life. To know
[59:37] your theology is not life. But to know
[59:40] him is life. Know the author of this
[59:43] book is life. Again, he said Satan knows
[59:46] the word better than any student in the
[59:48] world.
[59:50] That don't make him saved. Come on,
[59:52] young people. That don't make you saved
[59:54] just because you know the word. You've
[59:55] been taught the word. Many of you know
[59:56] more about the word than a lot of people
[59:58] do. A lot of grown-ups do. But that
[59:59] don't mean you're saved. You got to be
[1:00:01] born again the same way the grown-ups
[1:00:03] were. The same way we all were. Whether
[1:00:05] you're young or old, you got to be born
[1:00:07] again. Well, what if Satan read? He he
[1:00:09] he not only read it, but he was there,
[1:00:12] right? When when God put a curse between
[1:00:14] the serpent, the seed of the serpent and
[1:00:16] the seed of the woman in Genesis 3:15,
[1:00:19] where he said, "I will put enmity
[1:00:20] between thee and the woman, between thy
[1:00:22] seed and her seed. It shall bruise thy
[1:00:24] head, and thou shalt bruise his heel."
[1:00:27] He not only heard it, he felt the
[1:00:30] bruise.
[1:00:33] Glory to God.
[1:00:35] He knows what it was like to think he
[1:00:38] had almost won.
[1:00:41] To be rejoicing, having a party in hell,
[1:00:44] that he thought that Jesus had died on
[1:00:46] the cross and that it was all going to
[1:00:48] be okay and he was going to be okay and
[1:00:50] be able to do what he had done. And he
[1:00:52] hears a knock on the door.
[1:00:55] He knows what it's like to get kicked
[1:00:56] out of his own house.
[1:01:00] He knows what it's like to get evicted.
[1:01:02] You talk about a nervous guy. He's
[1:01:04] homeless because the keys were taken
[1:01:06] away from him.
[1:01:08] Now, come on, church. He only heard the
[1:01:11] curse, he felt the bruise. His head was
[1:01:13] crushed at
[1:01:15] Calvary. And he'd become weak and
[1:01:18] impotent and unable to do anything but
[1:01:22] be a bluff. Amen.
[1:01:25] Come on. He he reads Isaiah 14.
[1:01:29] Where where the prophet speaks, he said,
[1:01:31] "How art thou fallen from heaven, oh
[1:01:33] Lucifer, son of the morning. How art
[1:01:35] thou cut down to the ground which is
[1:01:36] weakened the nations? For thou has said
[1:01:38] in thy heart, I will ascend into heaven.
[1:01:40] I will exalt my throne above the stars
[1:01:42] of God. I will sit also upon the mount
[1:01:44] of the congregation, the sights of the
[1:01:45] north. I will ascend above the heights
[1:01:46] of the clouds. I will be like the most
[1:01:48] high. Yet thou shalt be brought down to
[1:01:50] hell." He believes that and he trembles
[1:01:53] at it.
[1:01:55] Said, "Brother Ben, why would you be
[1:01:56] excited about that?" Because that's my
[1:01:58] adversary. That's the one who caused me
[1:02:01] all the trouble that's ever been in my
[1:02:02] life. That's the one who created this
[1:02:04] Satan's Eden. That's the one who gave us
[1:02:06] these bodies of the humiliation. That's
[1:02:08] the one who caused sickness and death
[1:02:10] and everything else. That's the one who
[1:02:12] separates from our loved ones, us from
[1:02:14] our loved ones. That's the one who
[1:02:15] creates differences and and problems and
[1:02:18] situations in our lives. That's the one
[1:02:20] who makes anger and fear and all of
[1:02:21] those things. But I'm here to tell you
[1:02:23] that he don't have very long. He not got
[1:02:26] very long to do what he's doing because
[1:02:28] he said, "Thou shalt be brought down to
[1:02:30] hell."
[1:02:32] They that see thee shall narrowly look
[1:02:34] upon thee, and consider thee, saying, Is
[1:02:35] this the man that made the earth to
[1:02:37] tremble, and did shake kingdoms, that
[1:02:40] made the world as a wilderness, and
[1:02:41] destroyed the cities thereof, that open
[1:02:43] not the houses of his prisoners? All the
[1:02:46] kings of the nations, even all of them
[1:02:48] lie in glory, everyone in his own house.
[1:02:50] But thou art cast out of thy grave like
[1:02:52] an abominable branch, as the raignment
[1:02:55] of those that are slain, thrust through
[1:02:57] with a sword that go down the stones of
[1:02:58] the pit, as a carcass trotten under
[1:03:00] their feet. Thou shalt not be joined
[1:03:02] with them in burial, because thou hast
[1:03:04] destroyed thy land and slain thy people.
[1:03:06] The seed of evildoers shall never be
[1:03:08] renowned. He reads that and trembles.
[1:03:13] Do we believe this, church?
[1:03:16] Come on. Ezekiel 28:15, he reads
[1:03:20] this. Thou was perfect in thy ways, from
[1:03:24] the day that thou was created till
[1:03:27] iniquity was found in
[1:03:29] thee. By the multitude of thy merch,
[1:03:31] thou have filled the midst of thee with
[1:03:33] violence. Thou has sinned. Therefore, I
[1:03:36] will cast thee as profane out of the
[1:03:38] mountain of God, and I will destroy
[1:03:42] thee,
[1:03:44] oh covering cherub, from the midst of
[1:03:47] the stones of fire.
[1:03:49] Thine heart was lifted up because of thy
[1:03:51] beauty. Thou has corrupted thy wisdom by
[1:03:53] reason of thy brightness. I will cast
[1:03:56] thee to the ground. I will lay thee
[1:03:57] before kings that they may behold
[1:04:00] thee. Amen. Thou hast defiled thy
[1:04:03] sanctuaries by the multitude of thy
[1:04:05] iniquities by thy iniquity of thy
[1:04:07] traffic. Therefore will I bring forth a
[1:04:09] fire from the midst of thee. It shall
[1:04:11] devour thee. I will bring thee to ashes
[1:04:13] upon the earth and the sight of all of
[1:04:15] them. Behold thee. All they that know
[1:04:17] thee among the people shall be
[1:04:18] astonished at thee. Thou shalt be a
[1:04:20] terror. Now notice what he says. I love
[1:04:23] this. And never someone say never shalt
[1:04:27] thou be anymore.
[1:04:31] Hallelujah. Now, one of the great
[1:04:33] revelations that we've been given in
[1:04:34] this day is that hell is not eternal.
[1:04:38] Right? Why? He told the devil,
[1:04:41] "Never shalt thou be anymore." 2
[1:04:45] Thessalonians 1:9 tells us that that the
[1:04:49] angels that will be punished with
[1:04:51] everlasting destruction from the
[1:04:54] presence of the Lord, from the glory of
[1:04:55] his power. But but look here, the fallen
[1:04:58] angels. But
[1:04:59] look look look look what happens here.
[1:05:01] Destruction that word uh that word
[1:05:05] destruction punished with everlasting
[1:05:07] destruction in the Hebrew is or in the
[1:05:09] Greek and and the Hebrew equivalent as
[1:05:11] well is the termination of something by
[1:05:13] causing so much damage to it that it
[1:05:16] cannot be repaired or no longer exists.
[1:05:22] So how can something be punished with
[1:05:25] everlasting destruction? Everlasting is
[1:05:27] a length of time, right? It's a long
[1:05:30] time, but not
[1:05:32] eternal, right? It's everlasting
[1:05:34] destruction. So, what's eternal is the
[1:05:37] fact that he will no longer exist.
[1:05:41] Hallelujah. Look at Matthew
[1:05:44] 25:41. Then shall he also say also unto
[1:05:46] them on the left hand, depart from you
[1:05:48] cursed into everlasting fire prepared
[1:05:50] for the devil and his angels. So the
[1:05:54] hell was created for the devil and his
[1:05:56] angels. It was not created for you.
[1:05:59] Listen to me. We do not serve God
[1:06:01] because we're afraid of hell. Hell was
[1:06:03] not created for the Christian. Hear it
[1:06:05] with me today. Hell was not created with
[1:06:08] you. For you.
[1:06:10] It was created for the devil and for his
[1:06:12] angels.
[1:06:14] Right? So we don't serve God out of a
[1:06:16] out of a fear. I don't want to go to
[1:06:18] hell, so I'll serve God. That's not why
[1:06:19] we serve God. We serve God because we
[1:06:21] love God. We were created to serve God.
[1:06:24] We were created to worship God.
[1:06:28] Hell was created. It's not eternal. And
[1:06:30] these bodies are not eternal. They were
[1:06:32] created. But the spirit of God is
[1:06:33] eternal. It never had a beginning. It
[1:06:35] never has an
[1:06:36] end. Hallelujah. He said it never has an
[1:06:40] end. And the only way we can have
[1:06:41] eternal life from that Greek word Zoe,
[1:06:43] which means God's own life, he said we
[1:06:45] have we become a part of God. We become
[1:06:47] sons and daughters of God. And we have
[1:06:49] aonious life. Aonius life. He says, "So
[1:06:53] the part that lives us that recognize
[1:06:55] this word from here to there that
[1:06:57] recognizes is aonious life. Life without
[1:07:00] end. It's God's own life in us." That's
[1:07:02] the Greek word. Aonius, eternal,
[1:07:03] long-lasting. Describing the nature of
[1:07:05] something as enduring or
[1:07:06] eternal. Hallelujah. It describes
[1:07:09] something as lasting or enduring the
[1:07:11] age. The devil does not have that kind
[1:07:14] of life. It's nowhere in the scripture.
[1:07:16] That's
[1:07:17] right. He'll suffer for a long time, but
[1:07:20] he doesn't have eternal life. And he
[1:07:22] knows it.
[1:07:25] The devil can read Greek.
[1:07:29] Come on, church. He knows what that
[1:07:32] means. Look at Jude 6. And the angels
[1:07:35] which kept not their first estate, but
[1:07:36] left their own habitation. That be would
[1:07:38] be demons, angels, fallen angels that
[1:07:40] left their first estate. He has reserved
[1:07:42] an everlasting
[1:07:44] chains. Now watch. Everlasting.
[1:07:46] everlasting but not eternal. Everlasting
[1:07:49] chains under darkness unto the judgment
[1:07:53] of the great day. I went and looked up
[1:07:55] that word everlasting and it says a
[1:07:57] continual describes eternal continual
[1:07:59] describes a continuing period of time.
[1:08:01] But it it it says it describes Aodius
[1:08:05] power along with his God's power and his
[1:08:06] divine nature. But in Jude 6, he said
[1:08:09] the bondage in which the fallen angels
[1:08:10] are kept until the judgment day. It
[1:08:12] appears the word does not mean for all
[1:08:13] of time since there's an ending point.
[1:08:15] The ending point is the day of judgment.
[1:08:17] So it's everlasting to the judgment day.
[1:08:20] See, Satan knows about judgment day.
[1:08:24] And he trembles about it. We shouldn't
[1:08:26] tremble because we are judged here by
[1:08:28] the word. We were judged in the body of
[1:08:31] Christ. We don't have to be judged at
[1:08:33] the white throne judgment. It should not
[1:08:36] shake us, church, when we hear about the
[1:08:38] white throne judgment. But it does make
[1:08:39] him nervous.
[1:08:42] Sure it does. He knows about judgment
[1:08:43] day. Malachi 4:1 said, "For behold, the
[1:08:46] day cometh that shall burn as an oven,
[1:08:49] and all the proud, yeah, and all that do
[1:08:51] wickedly shall be stubble, and the day
[1:08:53] that cometh shall burn them up, say the
[1:08:55] Lord of hosts, that it shall leave them
[1:08:57] neither root nor branch. They'll be
[1:09:00] completely annihilated, completely done
[1:09:02] away with." He knows that Jesus came,
[1:09:07] and the devil knows better than anybody
[1:09:09] that Jesus did not fall when he was
[1:09:12] tempted.
[1:09:14] Oh, I love that. The devil many times
[1:09:17] has tempted you, hasn't he? He's tempted
[1:09:18] me. But he knows
[1:09:22] that the one that we trust, Hallelujah.
[1:09:25] The one whose blood was shed on Calvary
[1:09:27] did not fall
[1:09:30] when he was tempted.
[1:09:33] He tempted him in all like manner. The
[1:09:35] Bible says, like he does us. But he did
[1:09:37] not fall. He was there when he tempted
[1:09:40] him. And he said, "It's written." But
[1:09:42] Jesus said, "It's also written." He
[1:09:45] knows that that that that he did not
[1:09:47] fall like other men. He was there in the
[1:09:49] realms of the lost, as we said,
[1:09:50] celebrating with his demons when he
[1:09:52] heard a knock on the door. And brother
[1:09:53] Brandon said, "I can hear him say,
[1:09:55] "Satan, I'm the virgin born son of God.
[1:09:57] My blood's still wet on the cross. I've
[1:09:58] met every just requirement for Adam's
[1:10:00] fallen race, and I've come down here to
[1:10:02] conquer and take over." He takes the
[1:10:04] keys off of his side.
[1:10:08] How do we know he has the keys?
[1:10:09] Revelation 1:18. Satan knows this, too.
[1:10:11] He said, "I'm he that liveth and was
[1:10:13] dead. And behold, I am alive forever
[1:10:15] more." Amen. And I have the keys of hell
[1:10:19] and of death. He had to take those away
[1:10:22] from
[1:10:23] Satan. Makes him anxious. You ever been
[1:10:26] in a house? I grew up in a house that
[1:10:28] had no
[1:10:30] key. There had been a key. It was a It
[1:10:33] was a master key, one of those old
[1:10:34] skeleton keys, and it was lost. At some
[1:10:37] point during my childhood, we never had
[1:10:39] a key to our own house. And we were
[1:10:43] never anxious about it. At least I
[1:10:45] wasn't. Mom might have been, but I never
[1:10:47] worried about that. Dad didn't even own
[1:10:49] a gun most of the time. We didn't worry
[1:10:52] about it. It was just the kind of area
[1:10:54] we lived in. Oh my. But Satan is
[1:11:01] concerned. Because hell is not safe.
[1:11:06] Come on, church. He don't live in a safe
[1:11:09] neighborhood. He come to church tonight,
[1:11:11] but it's not a safe neighborhood. It's
[1:11:12] like us going to Memphis, you know? It's
[1:11:17] just we give him too much credit,
[1:11:19] church. He is not in a safe
[1:11:21] neighborhood. He come to church tonight
[1:11:23] because he got to he just something
[1:11:25] about he he's got to afflict you. He's
[1:11:26] got to persecute you. He's got to accuse
[1:11:28] you. So he comes and sits in the in the
[1:11:30] church with us and he tries to see what
[1:11:33] he can bring up and what he can bring to
[1:11:34] mind. But don't you know when he hears
[1:11:36] the word how anxious and nervous and
[1:11:38] upset and angry that he gets because he
[1:11:41] hears Jesus still saying, "I have the
[1:11:43] keys of hell and death." No wonder the
[1:11:45] devil gets mad when we repeat the
[1:11:47] promises of the word because he knows
[1:11:49] those promises include that he is going
[1:11:51] to be done away with.
[1:11:56] He don't have the keys to his own house.
[1:11:58] Do you know what that means, brother
[1:12:00] Peter? Do you know what that means,
[1:12:03] young men? Do you know what that means,
[1:12:04] young Hades? It means he cannot
[1:12:08] hold. Hallelujah. Remember what that
[1:12:11] what Isaiah said about him or or Ezekiel
[1:12:13] said about him? He said, "You you held
[1:12:14] your prisoners, wouldn't let them go."
[1:12:17] But when he had the keys taken away, he
[1:12:20] cannot hold one prisoner in the house of
[1:12:25] hell. Hallelujah. He does. He's a
[1:12:28] prisoner in his own church, in his own
[1:12:30] prisoner house. He cannot hold one seat
[1:12:34] of God. He cannot hold one soul released
[1:12:36] by the mighty conqueror in the house of
[1:12:40] hell.
[1:12:43] Makes him anxious when he realizes that
[1:12:46] he's anxious about us.
[1:12:50] Sure is. He sees the maturity of the
[1:12:52] bride. Yeah. That's why he's always
[1:12:55] influencing
[1:12:56] preachers,
[1:12:58] people, leave, go
[1:13:00] away, don't believe it
[1:13:03] anymore because it scares
[1:13:06] him that he sees the bride finally
[1:13:08] coming into
[1:13:10] maturity. So, he's trying to do
[1:13:12] everything he can to keep that from
[1:13:15] happening, to cause us to go back maybe
[1:13:18] to another age or another time. But I'm
[1:13:20] not going back. I'm going forward.
[1:13:23] My heart's been restored back and now
[1:13:25] I'm going forward to the top of the tree
[1:13:27] to where oranges are are produced
[1:13:30] again. He confused Satan confused
[1:13:33] doctrine and denominations. But he knows
[1:13:35] this. Romans 16:20. He's anxious about
[1:13:38] us because Paul wrote and said, "The God
[1:13:40] of peace shall bruise Satan." Amen. He
[1:13:43] knows what it feels like to be bruised
[1:13:45] and he's about to be bruised again. The
[1:13:47] God of peace shall bruise Satan under
[1:13:49] your feet shortly.
[1:13:51] Hallelujah.
[1:13:53] Oh, can we just believe that, church?
[1:13:55] The devil believes it and is anxious
[1:13:58] about it. If he believes it, I'm not
[1:14:00] going to hold you along tonight, but if
[1:14:02] he believes it and he's anxious about
[1:14:03] it, shouldn't we believe it and be happy
[1:14:05] about it? Shouldn't we believe the word
[1:14:07] of God and be willing to say, "Lord, I
[1:14:09] believe."
[1:14:12] Hallelujah.
[1:14:14] Amen.
[1:14:16] Amen. Hallelujah. He
[1:14:19] knows. Malachi 4:5, "Behold, I'll send
[1:14:22] you Elijah the prophet before the coming
[1:14:24] of the great and dreadful day of the
[1:14:26] Lord." And he ties those two together in
[1:14:29] a way maybe that we even don't. And he
[1:14:31] says, "I know if Elijah
[1:14:33] comes, my day is short."
[1:14:37] Right? Now, look. So, he says, he it's a
[1:14:41] student of the scripture, remember, a
[1:14:42] Bible student. And he said, "I'll send
[1:14:45] you Elijah the prophet before the coming
[1:14:47] dreadful day of the Lord." And Satan's
[1:14:48] looking. He says, "That can't be John.
[1:14:50] There must be another
[1:14:53] one." Now look how Satan tries to stop
[1:14:55] the work of God.
[1:14:58] Look what he did to brother Brandon.
[1:15:01] God allowed him to take brother
[1:15:02] Brandon's wife and baby. And brother
[1:15:04] Brandham sitting there. I want to speak
[1:15:06] to something for just a moment. The
[1:15:09] reason brother Brandon was in the
[1:15:10] condition he was in is because Satan was
[1:15:12] so anxious
[1:15:14] about what God might do through that
[1:15:16] ministry.
[1:15:19] He's about to get bruised.
[1:15:24] So what Satan did is he tried to get
[1:15:26] brother Brandham to take things in his
[1:15:28] own hands.
[1:15:31] You remember stuck a pistol to his head.
[1:15:36] Oh God. Well, he was a lineman. He's
[1:15:38] kind of get up there on a on a on a high
[1:15:40] wire and he tried to put his hand up on
[1:15:42] the
[1:15:44] line and God protected him.
[1:15:49] Why? Because Satan will not thwart the
[1:15:51] plan of God. Let me tell you, the reason
[1:15:54] Satan's making you depressed, the reason
[1:15:56] Satan's making you anxious, the reason
[1:15:58] he's making you think thoughts about
[1:15:59] suicide and things like that is because
[1:16:01] he's anxious about what God might do in
[1:16:03] your life. He's nervous about what hope
[1:16:06] you can just receive it today. He's
[1:16:08] nervous about what God might do in your
[1:16:09] life. And so he tries to get you to take
[1:16:11] things in your own hands.
[1:16:14] Amen. That's good. Oh my. He
[1:16:19] knew that if this ministry got started,
[1:16:22] he was in trouble. Yeah,
[1:16:26] he lost in battle over and over again
[1:16:30] because he knew Malachi 4:6, he shall
[1:16:31] turn the heart of the fathers to the
[1:16:33] children and the heart of the children
[1:16:34] to their fathers as I come and smite the
[1:16:36] earth with a curse. He knew that would
[1:16:37] happen and so he lost in battle over and
[1:16:41] over again. This is brother Brandon
[1:16:42] praying for a deaf woman, woman who
[1:16:44] couldn't hear. He said, "Thou art here,
[1:16:46] Lord, and this devil knows that his time
[1:16:50] has come."
[1:16:52] Hallelujah. And brother Brandham didn't
[1:16:54] even have to it didn't have to work up a
[1:16:56] a a thing. I was watching one of the
[1:16:58] other healing evangelists, the old time
[1:17:00] healing evangelist said and boy, he was
[1:17:01] working with somebody in a wheelchair
[1:17:02] and he worked it up and worked it up and
[1:17:04] worked it up and worked it up. Brother
[1:17:05] Brennham didn't have to do that. He
[1:17:07] prayed for the lady. He said, "This
[1:17:08] devil knows."
[1:17:11] Hallelujah. This devil knows that it's
[1:17:13] time. Wonder if he knows today that it's
[1:17:15] time has come. It's time to hold you
[1:17:17] with pornography is over. It's time to
[1:17:19] hold you with suicide is over. It's time
[1:17:21] to hold you with ungodliness is over.
[1:17:24] It's time to hold you with false
[1:17:26] doctrine is over. Why? Because the word
[1:17:28] has come to set you free.
[1:17:31] Hallelujah. Can we believe that today?
[1:17:34] Amen. He said this devil knows that his
[1:17:38] time has come to this woman entering
[1:17:40] into this sphere of faith here. He knows
[1:17:43] he's got to lose. He can't hold her any
[1:17:46] longer. Thou death spirit, come out of
[1:17:48] her. In the name of Jesus Christ, I
[1:17:50] charge thee to leave the woman. The
[1:17:53] woman was healed. He actually spoke and
[1:17:55] she heard him. Hallelujah. Again, he
[1:18:00] said, and we can find this all through
[1:18:02] the message, but just a couple of
[1:18:03] examples. He said, "Heavenly Father, in
[1:18:05] the name of thy son, the Lord Jesus
[1:18:06] Christ, I rebuke the devil." He said,
[1:18:09] "There are people's faith arising in
[1:18:11] such a way that now Satan knows."
[1:18:18] Brother Brandham said, "It's getting
[1:18:19] real milky over the audience. I can see
[1:18:21] just a faith bank over the building."
[1:18:23] And Satan says, "Oh no."
[1:18:28] Oh
[1:18:29] no. He hears you say amen to the word of
[1:18:33] God. He hears you. He sees that hand go
[1:18:35] up. He says, "Oh no, help."
[1:18:43] He does.
[1:18:46] There are people's fa rising in such a
[1:18:48] way that now Satan knows that he's lived
[1:18:52] his day. Soon he shall receive his
[1:18:54] judgment and
[1:18:56] tonight. Hallelujah. Just broke my
[1:18:59] glasses
[1:19:01] tonight.
[1:19:03] Hallelujah.
[1:19:05] Tonight. How many can say tonight?
[1:19:08] Tonight. Hallelujah. He will have to
[1:19:11] leave these people. He knows his his his
[1:19:14] day is coming. But tonight, he'll have
[1:19:16] to lead these
[1:19:17] people. Glory to
[1:19:19] God. Why? Because the word says so.
[1:19:25] Amen. Hallelujah. He said, "Resist the
[1:19:28] devil and he'll flee from you." He said,
[1:19:30] "Come out of them in the name of the
[1:19:31] Lord Jesus Christ as the church of the
[1:19:33] living God, as the newborn babes in
[1:19:35] Christ with the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:19:36] to execute judgment upon evil powers. I
[1:19:39] say by the authority of God's word come
[1:19:41] from the people in Jesus Christ's name.
[1:19:44] Hallelujah. Again, brother Brown, this
[1:19:46] is in the church age book. He said, I
[1:19:48] wish you could stand with me and see the
[1:19:50] faces of people when Satan knows he's
[1:19:52] going to be exposed. He said, now it it
[1:19:54] isn't the people that I'm talking about.
[1:19:56] It's that Satan has got a hold in their
[1:19:58] lives through sin, indifference, and
[1:20:00] disease, but you should see their
[1:20:03] faces. Oh my. We won't get into that too
[1:20:06] deep.
[1:20:08] But Satan knows. Satan knows. And he
[1:20:12] even the people's countenance has
[1:20:14] changed.
[1:20:15] Satan is afraid.
[1:20:19] Yeah.
[1:20:20] Hallelujah. He said Satan knows he's
[1:20:22] going to be exposed and the most
[1:20:24] peculiar changes come over the people's
[1:20:25] countenance. Satan is afraid. He knows
[1:20:28] that the spirit of God is about to let
[1:20:31] the people know of his works. That is
[1:20:35] why he hates these meetings so much.
[1:20:40] Hallelujah. He hated when people got
[1:20:43] together and faith was high.
[1:20:46] Right. And I was sitting there at at
[1:20:48] youth camp here a few weeks ago and
[1:20:49] that's when this sermon come to me
[1:20:51] because brother uh well, brother
[1:20:54] Brandham did this from time to time and
[1:20:55] I can do this. Brother Timothy Puit was
[1:20:57] preaching and he just cast a kind of a
[1:20:59] side comment. He said, "Satan's the one
[1:21:01] who's anxious because he knows his
[1:21:03] time's coming." And I thought, there it
[1:21:04] is. He's more anxious than I've ever
[1:21:07] been. Listen, can I be just open with
[1:21:09] you? I've struggled with anxiety since I
[1:21:10] was a kid. I've always and Peter's been
[1:21:13] afflicted with that and and struggle
[1:21:14] with that. I I struggled with that so
[1:21:16] bad that when I first started preaching,
[1:21:17] I couldn't hold a microphone. I couldn't
[1:21:19] stand up in front of people. I I was so
[1:21:22] nervous that I couldn't hardly do it.
[1:21:23] And I just, you know, I had only one way
[1:21:25] to preach. I had to preach with all my
[1:21:26] heart because otherwise I'd fall apart.
[1:21:28] And so, it's just the way that I was.
[1:21:30] and and from time to time, Satan will
[1:21:32] still try to bring that back on me. But
[1:21:34] I know this, he's more nervous than I
[1:21:36] am. If I get up and preach the word of
[1:21:39] God, he's much more nervous than I've
[1:21:41] ever been.
[1:21:43] I don't like crowds, but Satan really
[1:21:45] don't like crowds. He don't like to be
[1:21:47] around a crowd of believers that believe
[1:21:49] the word of God and all these licks of
[1:21:51] fire come together. He hates it when you
[1:21:53] go to church cuz he knows his time is
[1:21:56] short.
[1:21:57] That's why he tries so hard to keep you
[1:21:59] out of the house of God.
[1:22:01] Satan is afraid.
[1:22:04] Hallelujah.
[1:22:06] He said he hates the book of Revelation,
[1:22:08] the book of Genesis, because it exposes
[1:22:10] him.
[1:22:11] He said he knows that Jesus Christ is
[1:22:13] the same yesterday, today, and forever.
[1:22:15] And he changes not. He knows that a
[1:22:18] whole lot more than do 90% of the
[1:22:20] theologians. He knows that since God is
[1:22:22] immutable in his nature, he is just as
[1:22:24] immutable in his ways. Thus, Satan knows
[1:22:27] assuredly that the original church at
[1:22:29] Pentecost with the power of God, Mark 16
[1:22:32] in action is the true church that Jesus
[1:22:34] claims as his own. All else is false. It
[1:22:37] has to be. He said, "Now remember this,
[1:22:40] Christ in the true church is a
[1:22:41] continuation of the book of Acts." But
[1:22:43] the book of Revelation shows how the
[1:22:44] Antichrist spirit would come to the
[1:22:45] church and defile it, making it
[1:22:47] lukewarm, formal, and powerless. It
[1:22:49] exposes Satan, revealing his works, the
[1:22:51] attempted destruction of God's people,
[1:22:53] and the discrediting of God's word right
[1:22:55] down to the time he is cast into the
[1:22:57] lake of fire. He fights that. He cannot
[1:23:00] stand it. That's why he tries so hard to
[1:23:02] keep you from hearing it.
[1:23:06] He tries so hard to keep you from
[1:23:08] listening to tapes. He don't care if you
[1:23:09] listen to podcasts, YouTube, movies,
[1:23:13] but you turn on the voice of a prophet,
[1:23:15] see if Satan don't fight.
[1:23:18] Why? It exposes him.
[1:23:22] Hallelujah. Exposes him, brother David.
[1:23:24] He can't stand it. He knows. Amen. That
[1:23:28] if the people get the true revelation of
[1:23:30] the true church and what she is and what
[1:23:32] she stands for and that she can do the
[1:23:34] greater work, she will be an invincible
[1:23:36] army. Glory to God. That's you and I
[1:23:39] today. He knows that. Do you know that?
[1:23:42] Do we know that, church?
[1:23:45] Hallelujah.
[1:23:48] Hallelujah. If
[1:23:50] revelation can make Satan anxious,
[1:23:52] brother Bruce, shouldn't that same
[1:23:54] revelation give us peace?
[1:23:59] See, if there were two nations and one
[1:24:02] knew that they were going to be
[1:24:03] invaded and it was just about to happen,
[1:24:06] they were going to be at war and they
[1:24:08] were going to be destroyed. And somehow
[1:24:09] they knew that. And another nation knew
[1:24:12] and was sure that they would not be
[1:24:15] invaded. Wouldn't that give the nation
[1:24:17] that was sure that their their their
[1:24:20] future was secure, wouldn't that give
[1:24:22] them peace?
[1:24:24] Oh, church, wouldn't it give that person
[1:24:26] peace when they know that I'm going to
[1:24:29] make it and he isn't? And the and the
[1:24:32] cancer that's bothered me has an end,
[1:24:34] but but I'll have no end. And the
[1:24:36] anxiety that's bothered me has an end,
[1:24:38] but I got no end. And the devil that's
[1:24:40] caused me all this problems got an end,
[1:24:42] but I've got no end. Amen. Amen. She can
[1:24:45] realize she can do the greater work. She
[1:24:47] will be an invincible army. If his
[1:24:50] anxiety is a symptom of his knowledge
[1:24:52] and belief of God's word, what if we
[1:24:54] could believe that same word about
[1:24:57] ourselves
[1:24:59] in Jeremiah 29:11, he said, "I know the
[1:25:01] thoughts that I think towards you. He
[1:25:03] never said you were going to be done
[1:25:04] away with." Come on, church. He never
[1:25:06] said you were going to be annihilated.
[1:25:08] He never said that the bride wasn't
[1:25:10] going to make it. But what did he say? I
[1:25:12] know the thoughts. thoughts of peace and
[1:25:13] not of evil to give you an expected end.
[1:25:18] Psalms 33:11 says, "The counsel of the
[1:25:20] Lord standeth forever." Hallelujah. The
[1:25:23] thoughts of his heart to all, someone
[1:25:24] say, "All generations."
[1:25:27] Isaiah 26:3, "Thou wilt keep him in
[1:25:30] perfect peace, whose mind is stayed on
[1:25:35] thee, because he trustth in thee." I
[1:25:38] say, "Lord, take me up in your arms. Let
[1:25:40] me trust you.
[1:25:43] Because I need that peace.
[1:25:47] Brother Brandham taught us when the
[1:25:48] weakest of saints goes to their knees in
[1:25:50] prayer, the devils tremble.
[1:25:53] Why? They know their time is
[1:25:55] short. Hallelujah. He gets
[1:25:57] nervous. When we get in an atmosphere of
[1:26:00] faith, he gets so nervous that he asks
[1:26:03] for
[1:26:04] help. Did you know that brother Brandham
[1:26:08] is talking? He's talking to a woman and
[1:26:10] a man who are both suffering with
[1:26:12] stomach trouble and a nervous condition.
[1:26:15] A stomach trouble caused by a nervous
[1:26:16] condition. And you can find that related
[1:26:18] all through the message. Those of you
[1:26:20] who have suffered with that, I have that
[1:26:23] it's it's it's correlated.
[1:26:26] Right? I had a a doctor tell me, a
[1:26:28] specialist tell me said if you would
[1:26:29] quit your job, your trouble would be
[1:26:31] over.
[1:26:34] this
[1:26:37] job. I'm not about to
[1:26:40] quit. It's just the devil,
[1:26:44] right? But brother Brandon tied those
[1:26:46] two things together. He said, "Here's a
[1:26:48] black streak between I'm telling you
[1:26:50] those things. I I don't want to you
[1:26:51] think I I'm fine, but I want you to tell
[1:26:53] I want to tell you those things because
[1:26:54] I want you to believe there there's been
[1:26:56] a healing for me and help for me, and
[1:26:58] I'm able to stand up here and do what I
[1:26:59] do and function in spite of all the
[1:27:01] devil's tried to do to me. If he can do
[1:27:03] that for me, if he can do it for brother
[1:27:04] Brandham, he can do it for you today.
[1:27:11] Let's make him nervous tonight. Let's
[1:27:12] believe the word. Let's get him all in a
[1:27:15] fit.
[1:27:19] Brother Bren talked to this woman and
[1:27:20] this man both suffering with that
[1:27:22] condition of nervous with stomach
[1:27:24] trouble. And he said, "Here's a black
[1:27:26] streak between him and her." He said, '
[1:27:29] That's that devil screaming for mercy.
[1:27:34] We used to play this game called mercy.
[1:27:36] You get like this and you grab
[1:27:38] somebody's hands. Anybody ever done
[1:27:40] that? You know, other rednecks in here
[1:27:41] have done that.
[1:27:43] You take your hands like this and you
[1:27:44] just twist it. I was really good at it
[1:27:47] because I learned if you do it fast, you
[1:27:49] could really hurt somebody.
[1:27:54] And makes me sound like a bully, doesn't
[1:27:56] it? But I just learned how to do that.
[1:27:59] And they while I'm teaching these kids
[1:28:02] bad manners, bad things. You can tell.
[1:28:05] But we grab like that and then you you
[1:28:06] twist and somebody say, "Mercy,
[1:28:10] mercy." Then it was over. But you
[1:28:11] proved, you know, your
[1:28:13] dominance as a 10-year-old, you
[1:28:17] know. Oh my. That's why these kids are
[1:28:20] always doing this, you know, arm
[1:28:21] wrestling.
[1:28:24] But you realize that devil. Hallelujah.
[1:28:27] I The other
[1:28:29] day, sorry. The other day I I was at my
[1:28:33] house and the kids were arm wrestling
[1:28:34] and stuff and my daughter was convinced
[1:28:36] she'd beat
[1:28:37] Trip, not
[1:28:40] Esther.
[1:28:42] Melody. Anyway, she didn't.
[1:28:45] And they tried to get Trip to arm
[1:28:47] wrestle me. I said, "This ain't going to
[1:28:48] work." You
[1:28:49] know, I I don't have that high tolerance
[1:28:52] for pain, you
[1:28:54] know. Used to I'd do that till my arm
[1:28:56] would break. I can't do that anymore. Of
[1:28:58] course, he beat me. But look, I was by
[1:29:01] the time I was done, I'm like, I'm done,
[1:29:02] man. I have mercy. It's over.
[1:29:06] I'm done. You realize the devil's doing
[1:29:07] that tonight.
[1:29:09] God got him in such a chokeold. And when
[1:29:11] when a prophet stood there calmly and
[1:29:13] and just standing there in the pulpit
[1:29:15] and he said, "Here's a devil." And he
[1:29:17] don't he realized he's been exposed and
[1:29:19] even them calling out for mercy exposed
[1:29:21] him further.
[1:29:23] And so he said it's the devil screaming
[1:29:25] for mercy. He said you see he's calling
[1:29:28] to other spirits like I call for people
[1:29:31] to pray.
[1:29:33] So brother Brandon would say during the
[1:29:35] prayer lines he say now everyone pray.
[1:29:36] Everyone be in prayer. He wasn't just
[1:29:39] saying that. You realize when we tell
[1:29:40] you to pray one for another it's
[1:29:41] important that you do
[1:29:44] right? It's important that you do that
[1:29:46] because Satan's in the room, but God is
[1:29:49] in the room. When you pray for one
[1:29:51] another, what what what the preacher is
[1:29:52] doing is asking for help. I I need your
[1:29:55] help. And with your help, we can we can
[1:29:57] cast this thing out. We can get rid of
[1:29:59] all this all this problems and things,
[1:30:01] the sicknesses and stuff. If you'd help
[1:30:02] me, if your faith would increase with
[1:30:04] mine, and we could together we could we
[1:30:06] could do something. There's power in
[1:30:08] that. Where two or three agree on any
[1:30:10] one thing, he said nothing will be
[1:30:12] denied you. And so we know that that's
[1:30:14] true and the devil knows that that's
[1:30:15] true. But the devil, he said he he calls
[1:30:18] out to other spirits like I call for
[1:30:20] people to pray. He said be in prayer.
[1:30:22] See this demon calling for mercy. He
[1:30:24] said it's both the same thing.
[1:30:27] So the devil of nervousness and this
[1:30:29] woman when he when he when he s told it
[1:30:32] what it was, it screamed out help.
[1:30:36] I don't know how a devil talks, you
[1:30:37] know.
[1:30:38] Help. That's kind of a high-pitched
[1:30:40] devil right there.
[1:30:44] mercy. Oh my, pray for me. Like the
[1:30:49] little boy, I don't know if it's true or
[1:30:50] not, but someone said a little boy left
[1:30:51] the church and and uh as he walked out
[1:30:54] the the door, I think it's from this
[1:30:56] area of the story, he walked out the
[1:30:58] door and he hauled out, "Pray for me."
[1:31:00] He's about to go get a
[1:31:03] whooping. The devil's crying out, "Pray
[1:31:06] for me. Help me."
[1:31:08] But he's no match for being exposed by
[1:31:11] God's word. He said, "See that this
[1:31:14] demon's calling for mercy." Supposed the
[1:31:15] same thing. Sir, lady, the black
[1:31:16] streak's gone. The devil's defeated.
[1:31:18] You're both healed. Go home and be well
[1:31:20] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:31:21] All that he did by calling out to mercy
[1:31:23] was expose himself in another life.
[1:31:26] Hallelujah. So that that one could be
[1:31:28] delivered, too. Listen, we're not afraid
[1:31:29] of any devil. We're not afraid of any of
[1:31:32] any sickness. We're not afraid of any
[1:31:34] any disease. We're not afraid of any
[1:31:36] life that's been messed up. We believe a
[1:31:38] God that can change all of that.
[1:31:42] Hallelujah. He's nervous because he's
[1:31:45] been exposed. Can you imagine how bored
[1:31:46] he's going to be during the tribulation
[1:31:48] period?
[1:31:49] That's just a thought I had.
[1:31:52] It's You talk about bored. He ain't got
[1:31:55] nothing to do for a thousand years.
[1:31:59] And when the thousand years are expired
[1:32:00] in Revelation 27, Satan will be loosed
[1:32:03] out of his prison, go out to deceive the
[1:32:05] nations which are in the four quarters
[1:32:07] of the earth. Gog and Magog together
[1:32:09] them together to battle number of whom
[1:32:11] is as the sand of the sea. They went
[1:32:14] upon the breath of the earth and passed
[1:32:15] the camp of the saints about the beloved
[1:32:16] city and fire came down from God out of
[1:32:19] heaven and devoured
[1:32:22] them. Hallelujah. And the devil that
[1:32:25] deceived them was cast into the lake of
[1:32:27] fire and brimstone where the beasts and
[1:32:29] the false prophet are and shall be
[1:32:30] tormented day and night
[1:32:33] forever and ever. Look, going to be
[1:32:36] tormented. There's a great white throne
[1:32:39] judgment. Finally, a new heaven and a
[1:32:41] new earth, our future home. And no
[1:32:45] devil.
[1:32:48] Hallelujah.
[1:32:49] Not a big devil, not a little devil, no
[1:32:54] devil.
[1:32:56] He'll be done away with root and
[1:33:00] branch. Listen to me as I close as the
[1:33:02] musicians
[1:33:03] come. Satan knows that he will pay for
[1:33:06] every accusation he has made.
[1:33:10] And I know you're listening to me
[1:33:12] tonight and you're thinking, "Well, some
[1:33:13] of them was true."
[1:33:16] Not if you've been washed by the blood.
[1:33:19] Amen.
[1:33:22] Amen. Amen. Right? It's not a true
[1:33:25] accusation anymore. That's why we better
[1:33:27] be careful what we repeat about people
[1:33:31] because when we when we gossip about
[1:33:33] people, we might be repeating something
[1:33:35] that's under the blood. And if it is, we
[1:33:38] become the devil's ally
[1:33:41] to to say something that's actually on
[1:33:46] him, right? Because brother Brandham
[1:33:48] talked about how sin is dropped like a
[1:33:51] like a drop of ink dropped into a tub of
[1:33:54] bleach. Hallelujah. And he said the
[1:33:58] coloring of sin goes back through the
[1:34:01] mediators down through the
[1:34:03] time. Amen. Until it hits the accuser,
[1:34:08] Satan, and lays on him till the day of
[1:34:13] judgment.
[1:34:15] It's not only done away with, he not
[1:34:16] only forgets it, but the sin is actually
[1:34:19] so broken up that it goes back on its
[1:34:21] original owner.
[1:34:24] Hallelujah. The one who started sin in
[1:34:27] heaven, the one who began it in the
[1:34:29] first place, it goes back on him. And
[1:34:31] everything that you did, yes, you
[1:34:33] actually did it. But in the mind of God,
[1:34:35] it's been forgiven. And and the bleach
[1:34:38] of God's blood is so powerful that he
[1:34:40] will be punished. Amen.
[1:34:44] Hallelujah. Oh, I'm so thankful for that
[1:34:46] today. No wonder he's scared. No wonder
[1:34:50] the devil is anx got an anxiety problem.
[1:34:52] No wonder he's nervous. But it ought to
[1:34:56] bring great peace to the bride of Jesus
[1:34:58] Christ to know no matter what anybody
[1:35:00] says about me, I'm the bride. No matter
[1:35:02] what anybody No matter what anybody
[1:35:04] thinks about me, I'm still the bride. No
[1:35:06] matter what I even did, right?
[1:35:09] Hallelujah.
[1:35:11] I'm still his. I was washed by the
[1:35:14] blood. I was there when he saved me. And
[1:35:16] I guess I ought to know that my sins
[1:35:18] have been washed by the blood. And if
[1:35:20] they've been washed by the blood,
[1:35:21] they've been dropped in that tub of
[1:35:22] bleach. And they'll never Someone say it
[1:35:24] with me tonight. Never be remembered
[1:35:26] against me anymore. Hallelu. Do you
[1:35:29] believe it, church? If you believe it,
[1:35:31] then let's make let's make the devil
[1:35:33] anxious. Let's worship God with all of
[1:35:35] our hearts. and say, "Lord, I believe.
[1:35:38] Help thou my unbelief." If the if the
[1:35:41] devil knows the blood works and trembles
[1:35:44] at that fact, how much more should we
[1:35:47] know and
[1:35:49] rejoice?
[1:35:51] Hallelujah.
[1:35:53] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Oh, church,
[1:35:56] let's pray. Heavenly
[1:35:59] [Music]
[1:36:00] Father, Hallelujah.
[1:36:03] I've I've said all I can
[1:36:06] say. Lord, I pray that you'd help me
[1:36:11] today. Lord, I I I need that in my life.
[1:36:15] I need that assurance, at peace every
[1:36:17] day, Lord. Every day the devil tries to
[1:36:19] come and steal it away, but I have my
[1:36:22] rights, Lord. And and Satan has no
[1:36:24] rights to my mind, to my body. I I pray
[1:36:26] right now it would be cast out. I pray
[1:36:28] for each one of these people, Lord,
[1:36:30] Lord, that have believed your word. May
[1:36:32] peace come in where anxiety and fear and
[1:36:34] struggle and depression was, Lord. May
[1:36:36] peace come in where suicide was and
[1:36:39] every other thought, Lord, that'll be
[1:36:40] against you. I pray it'd be cast out
[1:36:42] today because we know that Satan has
[1:36:45] been exposed by the preaching of the
[1:36:47] word, by us preaching what a prophet
[1:36:49] taught. Satan has been has been exposed,
[1:36:52] Lord, today. And I believe he's nervous
[1:36:54] and he's anxious and he's worried. Lord,
[1:36:57] I pray you'd help us that we'd make him
[1:36:59] so nervous. He'd have to leave this
[1:37:00] place and leave our homes, leave our
[1:37:02] minds. Oh God, I pray you'd grant him
[1:37:05] every time he'd come around, we'd we'd
[1:37:06] we we'd tell him where he's going until
[1:37:09] he has to just go there on his own. I
[1:37:12] pray you'd grant that, Lord. I pray
[1:37:14] you'd move move in every mind, every
[1:37:17] heart, every home. Help us, Lord. What
[1:37:21] Satan tries to keep us from doing that
[1:37:23] would help us and heal us. I pray that
[1:37:24] you would help us to do that. Lord,
[1:37:27] realize that's the very best medicine is
[1:37:29] your word, Lord. Not just to read it and
[1:37:31] study it like Satan does, but to believe
[1:37:34] it from our heart. He can't do that.
[1:37:37] Pray you grant it, Lord. We thank you in
[1:37:39] Jesus
[1:37:41] name. Amen. Hallelujah. Can we just
[1:37:44] stand and worship him tonight? If you
[1:37:45] need prayer, I'll be glad to pray with
[1:37:47] you, but let's just worship
[1:37:48] [Music]
[1:37:50] him. Oh yes.

[1:38:00] all your heart now.

[1:39:47] verse.
[1:39:52] his
[1:39:56] son. They
[1:39:58] called him
