TRANSCRIPT
========================================
thou o king sawest and behold a great image this great image whose brightness was excellent stood before thee and the form thereof was terrible this image's head was a fine gold his breast and his arms of silver his belly and his thighs of brass his legs of iron his feet part of iron and part of clay thou saw us till that a stone was cut out without hands which smote the image upon his feet that were of iron and clay and break them to pieces then was the iron the clay the brass the silver and the gold broke into pieces together became like the shaft of the summer threshing floors and the wind carried them away listen that's the future of the gentile world kingdoms that's right become like the shaft of the summer threshing floors and the wind carried them away that no place was found for them and the stone that smote the image became a great mountain and filled the whole earth he said this is the dream and we will tell the interpretation thereof before the king thou o king are the king of kings for the god of heaven hath given thee a kingdom power and strength and glory and wheresoever the children of men dwell the beasts of the field and the fowls of the heaven hath be given into thine hand and hath made thee ruler over them all thou art this head of gold after thee shall arise another kingdom inferior to thee and another third kingdom of brass which shall bear rule over all the earth and the fourth kingdom shall be strong as iron for as much as iron breaketh in pieces and subdueth all things and as iron that breaketh all these shall it break in pieces and bruise and whereas thou saw us to feed and toes part of potter's clay and part of iron the kingdom shall be divided but there shall be in it of the strength of the iron for as much as thou sawest the iron mixed with miry clay and as the toes of the feet were part of iron and part of clay so the kingdom shall be partly strong and partly broken and whereas thou sawest iron mixed with miry clay they shall mingle themselves with the seed of men they shall not cleave one to another even as iron is not mixed with clay and in the days of these kings shall the god of heaven set up the kingdom aren't you glad he's going to do that which shall never be destroyed and the kingdom shall not be left to other people but it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms and it shall stand forever for as much as i saw us that the stone was cut out of the mountain without hands and let it break in pieces the iron the brass the clay the silver and the gold the great god hath made known to the king what shall come to pass hereafter and the dream is certain and the interpretation thereof sure amen let's bow our heads together for a word of prayer heavenly father we thank you for a sure word of prophecy lord and even in the new testament you spoke of a more sure word of prophecy something we could hang our hat on so to speak something we can we can guarantee lord that there will come a time when every kingdom of this earth will be destroyed and and and the great stone that was cut out of the mountain without hands will fill the whole earth and your kingdom will last forever we thank you for that lord and we thank you for the promises that you've given us lord and we look at the age that we live in many times it might strike fear upon the heart of people but lord as christians tonight we rejoice knowing lord that this kingdom is coming lord this this this stone lord is coming and the end times are here because we believe in a better kingdom one to come lord i pray that you to help each person or maybe there's one sick here tonight or have some need on their heart in their life i pray that you'd reach out to them even while we're talking about these things lord may the revelation begin to strike and stimulation of revelation take over the lord and their bodies and in their minds and take away the tiredness and the and everything that's going on lord may you begin to speak we pray in jesus name amen amen god bless you you can be seated excuse me for having you stand so long the current situation in ukraine makes us all kind of sit up and think and begin to look at what's going on in the world around us and we begin to realize that bible days are here the end times are here and yet there's been many times that we've looked at things and said this must be it and and realize that there was still some time left because we're still here but there will come a time when it is it right when it's it when the war starts and when uh when everything begins to be set in motion for the tribulation that time is coming and it could be now right there's nothing saying this couldn't be it it may not be but it could be right and so it behooves us to be ready and to be watching and to know these things because he comes as a thief in the night but not to us we have been told and shown these things so that we can be ready and have our garments on and be waiting a word bride for the bridegroom that's coming amen now we look at at the current ukraine situation and i believe i put on the slides uh some situation this was on a cnn report actually those people are desperate because they see the the wolf is at the door and even tonight they're being bombed and they're being destroyed in their cities and and they're just being taken over by a foreign you can't we can't even imagine what that feels like but they're praying and and but they realize at the end time there's message people there there are churches there there's there's a good group of message people in ukraine and so we need to our prayers need to be with them for safety because we believe that god's able to keep them even during this time and yet there's no promise that war couldn't break out or that something could happen and we might be caught up in about in a difficult political situation we don't know people have been before right and and so we don't know that we're not always promised that everything's going to be just the way that we want it to be but they were praying and so we need to be praying for them as they've been praying and you can see on that next slide that there's uh that was a bomb that a missile that actually hit the tv station there in kyiv and when it did it actually destroyed as well the jewish memorial one of the greatest uh worst moments of the holocaust was there in ukraine and keith there's a memorial to it a great concrete menorah that they had put there and the russians bombed it the other day and then turn around called them nazis i tell you what there's a lot of stuff going on but now but the situation is dire for them but let's take a step back and look at what the word tells us about russia about america about the world that we live in when brother branham was born the russians were a backwards former empire they were taken over by communism in around 1918 and finally become the soviet union under joseph stalin and then in 1960 we find that they had progressed to the point of having being a superpower having a control over much of the earth and there was a man by the name of nikita khrushchev and he was the leader of the soviets some of you probably remember this i'm not old enough to remember it but some of you do and he was the leader of the soviets there's a famous uh time when he took off his shoe and he banged it pounded it on the table and brother branham saw that and he attached a significance to it because it was reported widely in the news at that time he attached a significance to that event and tied it to daniel's vision in daniel chapter 2. now dwight eisenhower was the president of the u.s at that time and the name eisenhower means iron you can go look it up google it and however you want to look it up eisenhower means iron khrushchev means clay and so he said that was the iron and the clay in fact he said these two leaders he said were the big toes on the feet leading four other kingdoms each and and so that was going on at that time and so now brother branham said daniel had a vision he said the head of gold was babylon he said watch how that come down he said watch he said take the history in the bible he said and the next was the breast here of silver meets the persians he said the next was brass each time it got harder and harder and it showed that the gentile image could not stand because gold is the heaviest of all of them and it was top heavy it couldn't stand and each time he said the gold was the softest and silver is next and then brass next and then iron was next and he said each one of those kingdoms has succeeded one another just exactly the way the bible said they would do i want you to notice the accuracy of the vision what did daniel tell the king he said the vision is certain the dream is certain he said and the interpretation is is sure and so this isn't just brother branham but bible scholars over all over the world and down to the ages have seen these gentile kingdoms as they've come up he said just exactly the way the bible said they would do he said notice he said then at the end time he said before the stone was viewed out of the mountain the image had ten toes he said now that would be five on each foot two big toes four and five standing together he said as much as now to see that they were mixed with iron and clay he said now remember that was the gentile kingdom anyone knows that that they were iron and clay they would not mix and so much as iron and clay won't mix neither will these mix or cleave together they can't get along now that's why we have war in ukraine now what's happening in ukraine is that the west and the east are battling right but ukraine wanted to be aligned with the with the iron and the clay doesn't like it now think about it this nation is still represented in the iron this nation even under a protestant majority is still represented under romanism you can go and find that that don't ever stop the gentile kingdoms go all the way to the feet and in the toes that's the very very last form the most recent form that they're in before the coming of the great stone is actually they are iron and clay mixed together and even intermarried together random type that to protestantism and catholicism and he said that eisenhower was representing the iron khrushchev was representing the clay and so there's there's no wonder that there'll be war because the iron and the clay will not mix that's what makes it weak right and eventually there will be a war where russia will bomb the united states and bomb rome brother branham taught us that well there will be a nuclear war why because the iron and the clay won't mix they can't get along and god intended that it would be that way he allowed that now he said did you notice he said did you know what the name khrushchev means in russia dirt or clay he was heading up of them kingdoms you know what eisenhower means the head of this iron iron and clay and they couldn't mix together he took his shoe and beat it he said there's no mixing together they can't mix they won't cleave one to the other so when we saw russia become westernized over the last couple of decades you begin to wonder how is that possible for them to get that way but prophecy won't fail right they may be they may look like they're coming towards us but they won't cleave together that's prophecy they never will until the end time and so there's always going to be a war there there's always going to be a a difference there a difference of opinion now he said do you see friends the next thing left is the stone to be cut out the coming of the lord now i don't identify with the iron i want you to understand this tonight i am an american but i don't identify with the roman part and i don't identify with the clay the communist part right i don't identify with that what do i identify with the stone right and that's what we got to keep our minds on because many times we get wrapped up in politics and what we're actually doing you realize both democrats and republicans are the iron they represent that our political system represents the iron romanism right and so when we get wrapped up in politics that's exactly what we're representing eisenhower was a great president brother brown said he prayed for him he said he was a wonderful president he said in one place he loved him but he still represented the iron right and so we've got to make sure that we understand where we're at now so and so it's not wrong to to want to advocate for those things that are right i i even maybe i shouldn't tell you this but i vote you know i know that's a but i've always said that well i can't complain unless i vote so so i'd have a problem with doing that and i know some people don't and that's perfectly fine that's your american privilege by not voting you vote right you vote not to vote so and that's fine sometimes it's hard to know who to vote for but realize whoever you vote for it's the iron right that's you're voting for that gentile kingdom now and so brother branham said the next thing left is the stone to be cut out the coming of the lord to roll into this image and mash it into pieces and all these kingdoms will be ground and blowed away like the shaft on a summer's threshing floor we're at the end time brother sister can't you see where we are he said listen thus saith the lord i think when we hear thus sayeth the lord we ought to listen he said thus saith the lord repent we could just stop there but he said thus saith the lord repent why he said i predict three curtains in the name of the lord there's one called the iron curtain which will be russia so that's why he would say watch russia but he didn't stop there he said why he said watch red china right so he doesn't just say watch for us she says watch red china that'll be the bamboo curtain they're horrible but watch that purple curtain that's rising in the united states and over the world the roman empire the cruelest of all of them you know and i've kind of in my head over the years kind of thought well there'll come a day when the pope will be the ruler of the u.s but you know the bible doesn't actually say that it says he set up an image to the beast brother brown said that was the council of churches protestantism so this nation will always be a protestant nation go go go look at the book of revelation right it's an image it's daughters it's a great and she's got daughters the daughters continue to exist right they go on existing but they work together to try to defeat the uh the clay and and fight against communism or whatever it is that they're fighting against but it's actually working just in the plans of god until finally until finally the king of kings comes aren't you glad the king of kings is coming amen and he said they're they're horrible but watch that purple curtain that's rising now and he said that's the cruelest of all of them the cruelest of all of them so you look at what russia is doing right now you think about it look what russia's doing but a prophet of god said that there will come a time that this nation will do worse things than that now that's true that's the cruelest of all them look at let's look at brother branham's seven visions and i like to take this from where he's reading it he reads it off of the piece of paper where he wrote it down in 1932 and he reads his seven visions he said 1932 listen to this as i was on my way or as i was getting ready to go on my way to church this morning it came to pass that i fell into a vision he told where his services were being held he said it came to pass that while i was in this vision i seen some dreadful things take place i speak this in the name of the lord the president which now is president franklin d roosevelt will cause the whole world to go to war now everybody else was all in roosevelt's camp and today the history books will tell you roosevelt was a great president but branham said he actually helped cause that war he said in the new dictator of italy mussolini shall make his first invasion towards ethiopia and he will take ethiopia but that will be his last he shall come to his end he said we will be in war with germany watch russia now watch and remember at that time russia was nothing when brother branham wrote that russia was just a bunch of peasants they were still living in the stone age but he says watch russia and we read you the quote the other day where brother branham said god they had to awaken why did russia all of a sudden have all these scientists and and be able to get nuclear weapons and the things that they did they went from the stone age to the modern age in about 50 years how were they able to do that he said god had to allow them to wake up right to bring about the end now he says we will be in war with germany watch russia now he said now i see communism nazism and fascism watch russia but that is not the main one to watch right so we could we could look at the news that's going on watch russia but that's not the main one to watch the main one to watch is the one that comes in peaceably by flatteries here among us in the u.s now do we we believe a prophet right we believe the prophet's words this is what he told us watch russia but that won't be the main one to watch he said and the reason why is because it's apparent what russia is doing i mean it's just it's fabulous really if you look at it it's not not what they're doing but the fact that it fulfills scripture if you look at it like i said this could be it it would make sense for this to be the beginning of a third world war it's all laying out there we're living in that time now is it that time i don't know but if it is i'd pray that god's will would be done but now he said that is not the main one to watch he said it has been an evil thing done in this country they have permitted women to vote boy that'll get you kicked off the internet he said an evil thing bring women to vote now why was it an evil thing think about it without the women's vote we wouldn't have abortion without the women's vote we wouldn't have had john f kennedy a catholic president without the women's vote we wouldn't have had a gay marriage that's just a fact if you go look at the way that women vote we would not have had those things i don't mean you you godly sisters but i just mean the women of this world but the brown said it was an evil thing millions of babies have died right they permitted women to vote he said this is a women's nation she will pollute this nation as eve did eden he said now you see why i'm hammering the way i do he said i got thus saith the lord in her voting she will elect the wrong person he said the americans will take a great beating at a place that germany will build which would be a great wall and brother branham kind of jumps ahead of himself and goes back here he said be a great wall built of concrete the maginot line 11 years before it was ever built but finally there will be victors he said then when these women help elect the wrong person and i seen a great woman rise up in the united states well-dressed and beautiful but cruel in heart she will either guide or lead this nation to ruination he said i got in parenthesis perhaps catholic church but you realize these things could have multiple multiple fulfillments and you'd see the age that we're living in look what happened with kamala harris here a while ago again i don't say that was the fulfillment of prophecy but what if it was and then look at what's happening with russia today where are we at but see that that to the bride that doesn't make us more bride oh i'm going to be the bride now i'm going to live for god now because these things are happening no you live for god because you love god because you love the word you're you're going to be married to somebody you you love not somebody you're afraid of right so we're not identified with that with that gentile kingdom now he says he said also he said perhaps the catholic church also science will progress especially in the mechanical world automobiles will continue to get like egg shaped he said finally they will build one that won't need a steering wheel they've got it now it will be controlled by some other power you realize how fantastic that would have been in 1932 right you'll be controlled by some other power he said then i've seen the united states as one smoldering burnt over place it will be near the end now again america is shown as a continuation remember the iron and the clay is what the scripture said they won't get along they won't cleave to one another they won't get along so we see a battle between east and west we see a battle between capitalism and communism a battle between america and russia you could say but it's the whole system not just america not just russia and and even this nation and its founding it was founded as a as a lamb it was founded under religious liberty and yet if you go back and look at it you'll find that it was founded they emulated the roman system of the republic of rome in founding our system it's always had a roman element to it and the catholic church has grown in its power over time but again like i said it doesn't have to be catholic it doesn't have to become catholic for for these scriptures to be fulfilled in fact the bible if i understand it correctly says that it wouldn't because it would be an image to the beast and but they would go along with it they would all come and form a unity in order to go against something and so we see that as well where the nations are coming in unity to come against the russians right but but what is it just fulfilling scripture again if this is the time it's just the fulfillment of scripture and if it's not the time it's sure pointing to the time now here is america what what is america in the scriptures it's in revelation 13. and if you go to revelation 13 verses 1 through 10 is the first beast which was pagan and and papal rome and then in verse 11 he said i beheld another beast coming up out of the earth and he had two horns like a lamb and he spake as a dragon and he exercises all the power of the first beast before him now remember russia was not shown as a beast right rome was and america was and i'm not preaching an anti-american doctrine tonight but i'm just showing you what the scripture says right that really what you got to watch out for is this nation if you look in the end time events this is the nation that that turns against the bride this is the nation amen this is where it all comes to now he said is the uh i beheld another beast coming up out of the earth he had two horns like a lamb he spake is a dragon he exercises all the power of the first beast before him and causes the earth and them which dwell therein to worship rome romanism denominationalism right whose deadly wound was healed that's pagan rome becoming papal rome and he said there is coming and so brother branham talks about that he said there's coming a time upon in this nation to where this nation is going to exercise all the power that the beast had before it which was pagan rome when it became papal realm this nation will do that revelation 13 plainly explains that the lamb come up out of the earth the other beasts come out of the water sickness and multitudes of people out of europe he said this lamb come up where there were no people a lamb represents a religion the lamb of god remember he said it spoke like a lamb it was a lamb he said then after a while it received power spoke like a dragon and exercise listen church that's where we're at that's where we're at what's this last few years been about a lamb beginning to take power take away the people's rights are you with me now but we see that and say well i'm gonna get my ak-47 or whatever it is that we fight here with here in america and i'm gonna fight no that's not what the bride does we're going home right when the lamb begins to speak like a dragon we don't look at that and say oh i'm going to join some kind of group and fight against that although although i would be against it too i'd speak out against it but yet when you see that coming we say come lord jesus right that's our escape amen not to fight and throw over overthrow the government not to go out and and shoot one another do something like that but our escape is from glory our escape is to be translated in a moment in a twinkling of an eye that's where we're headed to and the way that this nation is in prophecy and this is what i love about this these things exist at the end time and so if that image of the beast is there and that and the beast that come out of the earth is there that means america can't be destroyed until we leave here because it's here even during the tribulation period amen all that ought to give us confidence to know that we're going to make it amen and the bride won't go through tribulation but now you see the the lamb has to speak like a dragon he said in exercise he said it received power and spoke he said after a while it received power and spoke like a dragon exercised all the power the dragon had before him and the dragon is rome always he said so don't you see roman denomination a mark protestant denomination an image making a power that'll force all protestants like a union he said you'll have to be in this council of churches or you won't be able to have fellowship now watch he said well it's practically that way now you can't go to a church and preach unless you have a fellowship card or some identification he said and now on persons like ourselves we're going to be cut out of all of that altogether you realize where we're at church we've been cut out of all of that right in brother madam's time you could go and preach in denominational churches from time to time but a message preacher today could find no pulpit not preaching the message of the hour you'd find no prophet in a denominational church why because you'd have to have some identification a fellowship card he said we're going to be cut out of all that altogether that's exactly because they won't be able to do it he said it's tightening and then when that time comes and the press comes to a place to where you're pressed out i don't know about you but i feel pretty pressed out i'm not you can't be a part of denominationalism and they're probably many good people you could have friends and we know as we preach about a pocket full of change god's got people everywhere but you can't be a part of that system you've been pressed out of that it used to be maybe you could go to church there and just sit there and now they're going to want to make you a part they're going to get your kids involved they're going to want to enroll you and be a part of it and when you come against you know you can't even get their health care service hardly unless you say you're a trinitarian that's true they wanna they wanna they want you to say that you're a trinitarian to get the healthcare service why because that's that's the hour we live in we've been pressed out he said then watch what i'm fixing to tell you in a few minutes watch the third poll then see he said it'll be absolutely to the total lost but it will be for the bride and the church hallelujah aren't you glad that during this time we have a promise that's what we're looking at right now what is that what is that and you say well it's speaking things into existence yes it is but the third poll is the power of the word among us amen the power of christ among us the power of the word and that's what we have we're not looking for another time yes it'll come greater and greater as we get to the end i believe that but the third poll is what we have we just have to go use it hey man amen so we're not looking for something some other messenger to come or brother random to come back but we'll be for the bride in the church amen we're the bride we've been pressed out we've been cut out from without hands if you could put it like that we've been taken without the form of a denomination we've been taken away from denomination and that's the time that we live in right now but look look at the thing you should be watching and again watch russia brother branham says that watch russia but what should we be watching here in the u.s because the bible says that there will be one that will come in peaceably and obtain the kingdom by flatteries by flatteries and brother branham said about that scripture he said exactly what it done he said that's what daniel said this antichrist would do he will fit the people's place i want you to watch this if you miss everything else that i say tonight i'm not going to hold you along tonight but if you miss everything else i say watch this he said that's what daniel said this antichrist would do he will fit the people's place it'll fit their menu for this day for the churches for in this church age they don't want the word christ but they want church what have we seen every kind of a thing will call itself a church i've seen this thing in near springfield called it courageous church and different ones they've got all kinds of different names for their church and it's seeker sensitive and you go to a church now like you do a fast food restaurant and you go in and you find out if the churches fits your lifestyle and if it fits what you want to hear and if it's if they don't talk about sin too much and if they don't talk about these other things too much if they if they're prosperous if they help you you say what can i get out of it and that's the way people go to church brother branham said that was this age it'll fit their menu for this day for the churches for in this church age they don't want the word christ but they want church the first thing they don't ask you now watch the spirit even comes in around us message people sometimes that they'll begin to tell you things what church they'll ask you they don't ask if you're a christian they say what church you belong to that's even true of us sometimes what church you belong to what church they don't want christ the word he said you go tell them about the word how to straighten up they don't want that they want something just live any way they want to and still belong to church and obtain their testimony i saw something today a person was advertised on social media for a dentist and they said please help i sent it to joel i said please help said i'm looking for a non-judgmental dentist who will work on a person who's scared of dentists for a low cost i said that's what they want from every pastor a non-judgmental pastor a non-judgmental church who will work on people who are scared of church at a low cost to myself but that's not what the bride is looking for the bride is like rebecca she said let me let me give water to the camels let me be apart let me volunteer amen hallelujah they want something just live anyway they want to still belong to church that spirit is so strong and if you go into the feast of the trumpets brother branham's talked about the the spirits that come on the river euphrates and he talked about how that they would come in an ecclesiastical realm and he goes back to this again and he says it'll be something like that where just pr just live any way you want to and still go to church that's the deception of this age and it creeps right in among us until i've had people sit there and tell me well it doesn't matter what i do i i i should be able to go to church i should be able to well you can go anywhere you want to but you're going you're going to hear it you're going to hear it when if you're looking for non-judgmental and you've got things that need to be judged then church is not the place for you not a real church because the church is a judgment seat god wants to judge that judge is not a bad word he wants to take it out of your life he wants to remove it amen so that's where the way antichrist comes in he said he fits the menu just exactly remember he was finally called she in the bible and she was a prostitute had daughters just fits the bill of the day what the people wants there it is now here's the statement you'll find brother branham say over and over and over and over again in the message he'll say don't be afraid of russia or something to that effect don't be afraid of communism he'll and he'll say something like this he uses this this over and over again in the message maybe a hundred times several dozens of times anyway he said it ain't the robin that pecks on the apple that hurts it it's the worm at the core he said i ain't scared of russia's atomic bombs no indeed why our own rottenness is what's killing us and we've seen that too haven't we where are we at church our own rottenness it's now legal to be married to someone of the same gender that's it's crazy it's insane it is absolutely insanity little children choosing their gender in school it's insane women taking their babies going around and and and messing around all that they want to and then taking the babies and killing the babies it's worse than the romans because we subsidize it with taxpayer dollars it's a barbaric system are you hearing me tonight where are we at we've got churches that don't want to ever hear anything about sin no one ever hear anything about what's going on our own rottenness is killing us but the bride has heard a voice that said come out of her my people be not partaker of her plagues oh aren't you glad you've heard that voice you heard a voice and you didn't hear just an earthly voice but you heard a voice from heaven but the matter said the voice of predestination speaking to your heart come out of her my people oh have you heard that voice tonight oh that that stirs me up tonight because i realized what a thing it's like i've been throwing a life raft i'm out here in the middle of a turbulent sea here is russia over here here's all the things going on over here and all the all the gay marriage and everything the world is seeking america is sinking russia is sinking going straight towards a nuclear war and here a life raft's been thrown out called the message of the hour amen god sent you a boat that you could get in and you could go all the way to the shore that you would not only not go down with him but you would go up with him hallelujah aren't you glad amen amen i didn't intend to preach tonight just talk about these things but oh it's been wonderful isn't it wonderful here you were just swimming around in the sea the cesspool and god sent you a way of escape he loved you so much that he chose you to come out of the age hallelujah oh he said brother brandon said the word of that little lamb that rose up in revelation 13 a lamb he said probably a little horn civil and ecclesiastical power but after islam freedom of religion and so forth but after a while he spake like a beast like the dragon and exercised all the power the dragon did before him a bitter religious persecution we're nearing that time and here's the quote that brother stewart read on sunday afternoon that was so striking he said do you remember church that you're living in the best day that you'll ever live in right now this is in 1951. he said until jesus comes it shall gradually he said not gradually but rapidly get worse and worse and again brother stewart read this but it's such a striking quote but the brandon said when russia goes down there to get that oil look out i'm not going to pretend i understand what exactly what that means but i do know that russia is headed towards israel the king of the north is headed towards israel over time it's what he does it's where he's going that's the goal he may not even know it but he's going to come against jerusalem that's the bible and so he said when russia goes down there to get that oil look out that's all she needs he said that's what the prophet said it would do and we're ready for it then now i think i put some maps on here and i'm not sure that i can even read them but uh if you could peter if you could put that one in the middle might be a little bit easier to read but uh if you look at the map of russia is up to the north on this one if you go back to the previous map russia is up to the north on this one and you can see that israel is down here on the on the left side and if you see iraq and iran there in turkey turkey is in between russia and israel russia is not very far from israel there's no sea separating russia from israel in fact a few years ago you remember they went in and took over georgia which is not our georgia where they got all the the guns and bad football but the uh the green area there is georgia a country the country of georgia and russia has already taken that and so all that stands between them because they're already in syria they've taken russia practically runs syria and so all this between them is turkey and then on the other side if you go to that next that next slide on the other side where they're going now is ukraine ukraine is to the west but it's the last it's the buffer country belarus there actually is a dictator there that's a puppet of putin's and then ukraine is below that and the puppet there in belarus was standing in front of the invasion map of moldova the other day every saw that in the news the dictator was literally standing there saying i'm not going to fight no war he's standing in front of a map that shows invasion plans for moldova they're not going to stop at ukraine not if they get what they want right and so they're going to keep going down where where are they headed to well eventually i don't that's a they could go either direction but eventually they're going to end up in israel you say how do you say that well brother branham said this he said again russia he called it king of the north he said how many has heard me just say he said just wave that over and over the old timers he said you see back in the early part of the church just stand there and wave it over and over watch russia the king of the north king of the north see what he would do for all those isms will heap up into russia daniel chapter 11 and verse 40 is where he takes that from and and if you'll go you can go and read daniel chapter 11 the entire chapter but he said at the time of the end shall the king of the south push at him now i don't know what this could be but think about it could be sanctions the king of the south pushes we don't know who the king of the south is in that prophecy in the old testament it was commonly egypt but we don't know who that is but we could say these western powers push at him and the king of the north shall come against him like a whirlwind with chariots with horsemen with many ships and he shall enter into the countries watch the countries not don't just stop at one you shall enter into the countries and shall overflow and pass over now brother branham says daniel is given this assurance at the end of the gentile dispensation he said read when you go home the 11th chapter he said you can see how the king of the north is coming down which is nothing else but russia coming down to press against it like a whirlwind and the great battle of armageddon will be fought right there near the gates of jerusalem it's like reading a newspaper in advance right you realize all these thousands of years ago was prophesied the king of the north and we're seeing it now look and again like i said i don't know they could be stopped for a while we don't know what the purposes of god are they could be beaten back but it will happen one day this could be it it could be ten years from now it could be a hundred years from now but it'll happen one day he said and the great battle of armageddon will be fought right there near the gates of jerusalem revelation 16 12 let's just go there and look at in revelation before we close revelation 16 12 the sixth angel poured out his vial upon the great river euphrates the water thereof was dried up but the way of the kings of the east might be prepared and i saw three unclean spirits like frogs come out of the mouth of the dragon out of the mouth of the beast out of the mouth of the false prophet now random typed those three unclean spirits early in his ministry to the three isms communism fascism nazism later on he typed him to trinitarian spirits a trinity of spirits or a trinitarian doctrine and then but then he said it would be the false prophet and the beast and and the dragon he said those three unclean spirits come out he said and they influence they influence what do they do the bible says they are the spirits of devils working miracles which go forth unto the kings of the earth and of the whole world to gather them to the battle of that great day of god almighty they don't know putin doesn't know they say is he insane why is he doing what he's doing could it be that one of these spirits have influenced him are you with me now the spirits brother brandon said it was just like nazism and communism but the brandon taught us communism was a spirit that's why when somebody becomes a communist you can't reason out of it it's a spirit and the communism is the spirit and these things are spirits through the spirits of devils but brother branham taught us and you go you can go look it up but these spirits are manifested when the seals were open he said until the seals came open the spirits could not be manifested the three unclean spirits like frogs but now that they now they are oh church if we could just realize the hour that we're living in if they could not be manifested the bride could not be manifested until the seals were open but here we are right those unclean spirits amen are going into the kings of the world to gather them to armageddon but the spirit of god is going into the bride together heard of the marriage supper oh isn't it wonderful now he said they're the spirits of devils go forth to the kings of the earth end of the whole world to gather them into the battle the great day of god almighty notice what he says striking revelation 16 15 the next verse behold i come as a thief blessed is he that watcheth and keepeth his garments lest he walk naked and they see his shame you know what this is talking about is a soldier that would be on guard on the temple wall and he would be standing on the guard and and sometimes because of the the country there in jerusalem was so dry and and so uh so hot that at night in order to sleep they would take out their take off their outer garment and and and lay down and if they're laying down asleep they're not watching right and this man was responsible and actually what they would do to him when they caught him in that condition is if they've caught you without your clothes on right and and you laid down for the night instead of watching they would make you march back to your house without your clothes because that's why it says lest he walk naked and they see his shame he's marching back without his clothes on because he was caught on in a watchman's position but he wasn't watching so he says blessed is he that watcheth so it's good that we look at these things it's good that we see when we see armageddon when we see things shaping up for armageddon it's good that we keep our word garments around us and stay awake don't let the world don't let laodicea lull you to sleep make you think you're okay but stay with us with a reveal for repentance a seal for god a seal if there ever was a time we ought to have a seal for the house of god it ought to be this hour if there ever was a time we ought to have a passion for lost souls it ought to be this hour if there ever was a time that we had a a desire in our heart to to see the word of god manifested it ought to be this hour amen blessed are they that watch and keep their garments hallelujah and he gathered them together into a place called in the hebrew tongue armageddon and the seventh angel poured out his violin to the air this is it when that happens that's it there came a great voice out of the temple of heaven from the throne saying it is done it's all over the last angel pours out his vial and there were voices and thunders and lightnings there was a great earthquake such as was not since men were upon the earth so mighty and earthquake and so great and the great city was divided into three parts and the cities of the nations fell and great babylon came in remembrance before god given to her the cup of the wine of the fierceness of his wrath you can go to revelation 17 and 18 and it speaks of the judgment of the great and her daughters that's set on seven hills which we know is rome and then the protestant denominations and then in revelation 19 1 he said after these things i'm so glad there's an after i heard a great voice of much people in heaven where did they come from when all this is going on on the earth and they see the smoke rising up from babylon where are the people in heaven where do they come from that's us hallelujah it ain't a quiet bunch either because they just saw rome destroyed they just saw the things that that were prophesied in scripture take place and they said hallelujah salvation and glory and honor and power unto the lord our god for true and righteous are his judgments free it judged the great which did corrupt the earth for their fornication and has avenged the blood of his servants at her hand where they had in heaven they went left in the rapture before the events of armageddon aren't you glad the bible is so correct where are we at before that first bomb falls we gotta get out of here hallelujah before jerusalem is compassed about with harmings we have to leave oh my and then if you go down to revelation 19 11 it said i saw heaven opened behold a white horse he that set upon him was called faithful and true and then righteousness righteousness he does judge and make war oh i we've seen all this killing of civilians and all these things and all the tricks that they have nations have up their sleeves to try to stop one another and try to kill one another but here comes the king amen here comes the king who makes war but he makes war and righteousness his eyes there is a flame of fire on his head were many crowns he had a name written that no man knew but he himself he was clothed with a vesture dipped in blood his name is called the word of god oh if we only realize how powerful the word is today he said in the armies which were in heaven guess who that is oh you see who russia is and what they're going to do you see the iron and the clay mixed together but church if you could only see who you are the armies which were in heaven this is an army that has no problem with logistics the russians had a problem with logistics we don't they had a problem with taking over the air this army has no problem taking over the air because the hey man they were overcomers in each of their ages don't you see they were the overcomers of the ephesian age and the smernian age and the pergamos age and the philadelphian age and the laodicean age and the overcomers of the ages hallelujah you talk about some generals he's got generals amen he's got generals that overcame in their age the armies which were in heaven followed him upon white horses clothed in fine linen white and clean hallelujah out of his mouth they're well fed they've just been at the marriage supper for three and a half years hey man don't have to worry about supply lines if they need it they just speak it into existence are you with me now i know it sounds fantastic but
