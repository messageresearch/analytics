Dyersburg and I I let brother Ben I was known let him know I was coming to town and he invited me over thank you very much brother Ben and um from Shalom Tabernacle in Tucson Arizona brother Israel PO he sends his greetings to each and everyone and if we could just while we're all standing just turn in the scripture real quick over to Hebrews the 10th chapter Hebrews the 10th chapter verses 31-36 Hebrews 10: 31-36 it reads it is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the Living God but call to remember rembrance the former days in which after you were illuminated you endured a great fight of afflictions partly whilst you were made a gazing stock both by reproaches and afflictions and partly whilst you became Companions of them that were so used for ye had compassion of me in my bonds and took joyfully the spoiling of your goods knowing in yourselves that ye have in heaven a better and an enduring substance now listen to verse and 36 says cast not away therefore your confidence which hath great recompense of reward for ye have need of patience that after ye have done the will of God ye might receive the promise amen let's bow our heads Heavenly Father Lord we just thank you for another opportunity to come in your house father Lord we so appreciated the message that we got from you this morning we just we just want to say thank you Lord From The Bottom Of of our heart and Lord as this service goes forward we just ask that your presence would be among us that you would move me out of the way father and that it would only be you speaking here we ask these things in the precious name of the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen amen you may be seated so we can see in the scriptures all throughout the scriptures there are certain there's Promises of Victory all throughout the scripture we can see it Old Testament we can see it New Testament but Victory as a Believer it is also God's will in our life we can read Isaiah 53 and we can see that victories certain victories are God's will in each and every one of our lives but sometimes what what easily can slip our mind is that God is Sovereign in his timing all right come on we have promises of Victory but the timing that's not that's not promised at any certain time God acts when he wants to act we don't get to choose when we get our blessings we don't have just blessings in our pocket that we can pull out and have them whenever we want but sometimes we have to wait on something but sometimes we don't have to wait on Victory sometimes we have Victory you know you come up you have a sickness you come up to get prayed for you get hands laid on you or maybe you're at home you're kneeling by your bed and you have immediate Victory you have an immediate assurance that that thing that has been plaguing you that it's gone but sometimes we have to wait come on and we wait on the Lord because it's you know it's like child training really you know the children you can't always give a child exactly what they want when they want it because sometimes the children they don't realize what's good for them at all times you know if they wanted to go play out in the road well don't let them go play out in the road that wouldn't be very beneficial to their health but we live in such a sometimes it's hard to have patience is that scripture it said for ye have need of patience and some sometimes in this age it's so hard to have patience waiting for a blessing in your life waiting for healing in your life waiting for something to come that you know is promised to you as a believer in the scripture you know it's your right to have it but sometimes it's hard to understand why you can't have it right then sometimes that's a that's a bit of a struggle and we live in such a age of convenience the age of fast food the age of you can go to well Amazon Same Day deliveries you can what whatever it is it's such an age of convenience and I think this being an age of convenience has led this to be an age of impatience we don't know how to wait on anything anymore all right back in the day I think people would come kneel at the altar and they would pray through until the Holy Ghost came but if the Holy Ghost doesn't come then we want to give up sometimes we want to get up off our knees and we want to move forward with our day if we pray for healing and our body's still hurting we want to get up and we want to move forward with our day but sometimes you just got to wait on the Lord in those moments you got to sit and wait you got to listen to what he's saying in those moments not just what you're saying sometimes we do too much talking all right come on we got to leave room for God to act in our lives we got to leave room for him to do something not just what we can do and I have a second scripture here in the it's in judges chap 6 vers 7- 27 judges 6 veres 7- 27 now a little background for this scripture so this is Israel this is a scripture on Gideon in Israel so Israel they had been delivered into the hand of the midianites they had been in their hand for seven years they had been crying out they had been just in bondage for seven years and they I think the Bible speaks that they they didn't really understand why at this point they didn't understand why they still had to be in bondage they they didn't see they they wern't seeing it especially after looking at the victories in their past they could look back just so many years and there was Victory after Victory and then at this point there was seemingly no Victory God God seemingly wasn't hearing their prayers they were crying out and they were receiving nothing at this point that's true but we start here in verse 7 it says and it came to pass when the children of Israel Cried unto the Lord because of the midianites that the Lord sent a prophet unto the children of Israel which said unto them thus sayeth the Lord God of Israel I brought you up from Egypt and brought you forth out of the house of bondage and I delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians and out of the hand of all that oppressed you and drave them out from before you and gave you their land and I said unto you I am the Lord your God lord excuse me fear not the god of the amorites in whose land ye dwell but ye have not obeyed my voice and there came an angel of the Lord and sat under an oak which was an ofra that pertained unto joash the abizer and his son Gideon threshed Wheat by the wine press to hide it from the midianites and just like our enemy today the midianites they were trying to steal everything that Israel had that was rightfully theirs that's why Gideon was threshing at the wine press he wasn't at a threshing floor where this usually happened at he was forced to go somewhere else because the enemy was on it was rampant he was trying to take everything that was rightfully Gideon's and rightfully Israel's he was trying to take it all from him yeah goes on verse 12 he says and the angel of the Lord appeared unto him and said unto him the Lord is with thee thou Mighty Man of Valor and Gideon said unto him oh my Lord if the Lord be with us us why then is all this befallen us and where be all his miracles which our fathers told us of saying did not the Lord bring us up from Egypt but now the Lord hath forsaken us and delivered us into the hands of the midianites now look at that the something Gideon and Israel had been waiting on for a long time the angel of the Lord to appear and he tells Gideon the Lord is with thee th Mighty Man of Valor and the first thing Gideon wants to do is question the Lord qu this is a capital l Angel of the Lord capital L he wants to start questioning what he's been told already not a amen not a Hallelujah not a praise the Lord but immediate questioning right away that's true yeah it says and the Lord looked upon him and said go in this thy might and thou shalt save Israel from the hand of the midianites have not I sent thee now who sent Gideon right Gideon didn't send Gideon nobody else from Israel sent Gideon but the Lord sent Gideon he had Authority he had it the Lord had sent him he didn't choose this for his own life goes on it says and he said unto him oh my Lord wherewith shall I save Israel behold my family is poor in Manasseh and I am the least in my father's house now what Gideon was doing Gideon right there is looking at who he has been yeah he's probably looking at who he is right then but what God's looking at is what Gideon can be what Gideon's going to be that's what he's looking at sometimes we get stuck at looking at who we have been we let the the the trials and the errors of the past dictate things in our future and we don't have to do that right there's a blood that covers that for us and we can trust in that blood is that right that's good he says and the Lord said unto him surely I will be with thee and thou shalt Smite the midianites as one man and he said unto him if now I have found Grace in thy sight then show me a sign that thou talkest with me he says Lord I know what you I know what you're saying I I know what your word says I I know all this but Lord I just need a little bit more I need a little bit more from you I know there's been miracles in your day I know you've seen all that but I just need a little bit more Lord he says depart not hence I pray thee until I come unto thee and bring forth my present and set it before thee and he said I will tar until Thou come again and Gideon went in and made ready a kid and unleavened cakes of an epha of flower the flesh he put in a basket and he put the broth in a pot and brought it out unto him under the Oak and presented it and the angel of God said unto him take the Flesh and the unleavened cakes and lay them Upon This Rock and pour out the broth and he did so how beautiful is that the same rock this is the same Rock that Gideon had had sweated over that he had cried on that that he had been it was part of his bondage really because he he shouldn't have been there he should have been at the threshing floor that was his right to be at the threshing floor but this rock that's where he was forced to be by the enemy but what happens is his sacrifice completely covered it all all right oh thank the Lord think about it says then the angel of the Lord put forth the end of the staff that was in his hand and touched the Flesh and the unleavened cakes and There Rose up fire out of the Rock and consumed the Flesh and the unleavened cakes then the angel of the Lord departed out of his sight now notice this as we go on just after Gideon had seen this happen it was a miracle by all means he had been waiting on it Israel had been waiting on it and the first emotion that hits him after this miracle is fear he gets scared as we read on it says and when Gideon perceived that he was an angel of the Lord Gideon said alas oh Lord God for because I have seen an angel of the Lord face to face and the Lord said unto him peace be unto thee fear not Thou shalt not die then Gideon built an altar there unto the Lord and called it Jehovah Shalom unto this day it is yet an ofra of the Abit and it came to pass listen to this the same night you mean to tell me that Gideon didn't have there wasn't a FL bed of ease in between his trials and his test you mean that same night the Lord had already commissioned him to do something else he didn't have any time in between in between his trials and the tough times in his life you mean one battle stopped and then another one began who's been there before who's felt that before no time in between the enemy is not going to take a day off we can't take a day off he's not going to stop We Can't Stop sir that's right right if he could pray he's praying for your demise so we have to pray for our uplifting come on we can't stop we can't we have to keep moving forward in this day the prophet tells us that there's a quote he says right here he says the hours are coming when this world will shake under the impact of the Church of the Living God that's moving forward in great power he said that's right I hope to see it in my generation not moving backwards in great power but moving forward in great power taking what's rightfully ours taking your healing taking our the chastisement of our peace was upon him taking our peace back returning the joy of our Salvation in our lives taking these things back from the enemy in this day yeah that's good as he goes on in that verse 25 he says that the Lord said unto him take thy father's young bulock even the second Bullock a seven years old and throw down the altar of Baal that thy father hath and cut down the Grove that is by it and build an altar unto the Lord thy God upon the top of this rock in the ordered place and take the second bulock and offer a burnt sacrifice with the wood of the Grove which Thou shalt cut down says then Gideon took 10 men of his servants and did as the Lord had said unto him and so it was because he feared his father's household and the men of the city now what had Gideon seen already come on I mean my goodness how much more do you need but but we're going to fear our father's household oh my says and the men of the city that he could not do it by day that he did it by Night still a little fearful to take that next step still a little fearful to take what is rightfully his by the Lord but if the Lord spoken don't be scared to walk in it if he's told you something don't be scared to move that direction if he's let you know you don't have to be fearful there there may be a sea in front of you but he'll split that sea if it's what his word say he'll do what he has to do to get you where you need to be in life but sometimes we have to wait on it we have to be patient for it it's like walk if you're walking on a trail with just lamp light you can really only see about 5et in front of you but just because you can only see five fet that doesn't mean that's all the trail that's there the trail keeps going you just as long as you got that light with you as long as you got it with you you can keep going forward it will show you where to go it'll light the path you don't have to worry about it but you got to keep that light with you you can't let it go Prophet says in another place he says now remember when God has counted you worthy when you have a test God's counted you worthy when you have a test he said now don't fail this to get this when you have a trial or a test it shows the grace of God has found says you found favor with God you found favor with God and God believes that you'll stand a test if God believes that I can stand a test then who am I to think I can't stand a test who am I to say anything different who am I to doubt if I can keep going if this is just showing that God has favor with me like he did job let's be a job let's keep marching forward no matter what how does that sound God found favor with job he called him a perfect man and he he said just do whatever you want to him but don't take his life yeah and maybe sometime how uplifting is that to think that you might be a job sting here that these trials these things you've been going through that it's just God's favor finding you in your life it's just his grace finding you in your life and that's that's the tough times are nothing more than that come on in your life but even then Gideon needed a little bit more he had to know that the Lord would go before him and that is the important part you need to know that God is going to go before you and whatever you are doing that's the main thing that's the very main thing in judges 6 I think it's uh verses 36-40 it goes on Gideon with the fleece it says and Gideon said unto God if thou wil save Israel by mine hand as thou Hast said behold I will put a fleece of wool in the floor and if the D be on the fleece only and it be dry upon all the Earth beside then shall I know that thou wil save Israel by mine hand as thou th H has said as thou Hast said so he just admitted God's already told him come on but I need a little bit more Lord I don't I don't really want to wait to see this happen I need you to show me something right now I can't wait on this Lord it says and it was so for he rose up early on the tomorrow and thrust the fleece together and ringed the de out of the fleece a bowl full of water oh yeah and Gideon said unto God see at this point I think Gideon knew he was kind of he was walking on iffy I think he knew that he might be messing up a little bit by I'm just going to ask one more thing he knew that he should have enough faith for this but are we much different in this day shouldn't we have faith for whatever promise God has for us how much have we heard how much have we seen we can say well but but Gideon saw the angel of the Lord but don't we have a photograph that's an Evidence in this day don't we have the only Supernatural photograph ever taken in this day haven't we seen some stuff too he says Gideon goes on he says let not thine anger be hot against me and I will speak but this once let me prove I pray thee but this once with the fleece let it now be dry only upon the fleece and upon all the ground let there be due and how gracious of the Lord it says and God did so that night oh thank the Lord how faithful he is how gracious and merciful he is he didn't have to do that again Gideon had ask one too many times sometimes we've asked one too many times but he is always faithful he is never forsaking us is that right has he forsaken anyone here today no he has not but from this moment on Gideon wasn't asking any more questions if you following the scripture he was in action yeah Gideon was going forward now come on he had been shown enough and it was time to March forward but the Lord through these things he had to get Gideon's character to a place where he could use him because when he found Gideon I guarantee you he was downtrodden he was sad he was everything had been took from him that's he didn't feel blessed he didn't feel like God's chosen come on he was in probably a pretty dark place when the angel of the Lord appeared on the scene for him but just as he does today you know sheep a sheep isn't bornn to sheep it's born a lamb come on and it's got a mature it's h it has a a maturing process to get to being a sheep and I thought this was interesting I looked it up the other day one of the main things that shows that a lamb has become a sheep as they finally recognize and listen to The Shepherd's voice oh thank that's one of the main things where you can tell that that little old lamb has moved on to being a sheep now because it will adhere to what the shepherd's voice tells it right it won't do anything but what that Shepherd says it'll be out in the field and it's just all the time trying to listen to what the shepherd has to tell it what direction to go what to do when to do it and they have special ways of speaking to one another I thought that was amazing but even we we think about this and we look at maybe maybe take with our lives even if Gideon if he had not gotten an answer directly from the Lord it would have only so they had already waited s years let's say this hadn't happened till 10 years later all that that's going to do is make the miracle even greater when it does happen right it's not that it's going to be a struggle but all that's going to do is just make that miracle in your life greater when it does come forth when that promise is answered and it's delivered and the timing comes for you to receive your blessing from the Lord that Miracle will only be greater at that point and just how it happened with Abraham and Sarah you know the prophet says here he says and instead of getting weak like you do and like I do if God don't answer right in a minute you say well I failed to get it but Abraham got stronger all the time knowing that the longer it lasted before the baby was born greater Miracle it was going to be and you know Abra he didn't let his mouth confess anything opposite of God's promise he watered that promise daily with praises over and over again you know it there's many quotes on uh the prophet talking about you know you get your healing and what you confess if you confess opposite of it the sickness comes back on you well that's not just with healing that's with circumstances in your life that's what things you got going on you start confessing opposite of that it's going to come back because you're not confessing what this this Bible says you're confessing what what the enemy is putting in your mind what he's injecting in there and we should only be confessing God's promises in this day yes sir we've seen too much not to we know too much not to we know what this scripture says to us but when he finally does answer and that Miracle finally comes in your life just think about how every angel in heaven will they'll be rejoicing your brothers and sisters at the church with you they'll be rejoicing thank Lord amen there will be S there there will be a host just looking down at you they've watched you struggle they've watched you be in pain they've watched you you can barely move some days come on but when it happens it's going to be special but he had that answer there was no turning back now it was time to March forward and finally take back exact what was there from the midianites and that's exactly what he does if you continue on that's what he did but Gideon didn't win by his own strength the Lord went before him that was the Lord's battle to fight that was the Lord's strength that won that battle Gideon was just a man yeah used by the Lord yes it was the Lord that won that battle and I thought this was interesting the prophet says you don't have to knck down to the devil said we've got a law That's the Law of the holy spirit said the only thing you know have to do is know how to let go and let God now that's not always the easiest thing to do is it just to let go and let God when you're in pain yeah it's not easy yeah that's right the prophet says you keep fighting at it see and it won't never work that's right come on you keep fighting at it see and it won't never work he said when you let go and let God that's all see and in that same message as a couple paragraphs down he says in the same way it is with us it isn't what we fight and Pull and hurry and oh if I don't get this if I don't get that that's not it it's to know that the law of life is in you sir it's to know that and you just let go and let God then he takes you to your healing then he takes you to the baptism of the spirit or anything that he's promised yes than any claim that he's given is yours yes and by letting go and letting God and God had spoken it didn't matter if Gideon had one man beside him no men beside him an army of a million men behind him the Lord had spoken and it was going to be his they were going to take back what was theirs because the Lord had spoken on this subject oh yeah and he's spoken in our day too Prophet says in another place nothing will stop a man once he gets his answer from the Lord he said nothing will stop a man once he gets his answer from the Lord but what about before the answer comes that's the tough part what about before the answer comes how are we handling it he says then remember in the Lord and I wonder if really when we meet together like this in Heavenly places if that isn't communion that we are communing with God talking to him excuse me and then if we just sit still and let him answer us back yes we just sit still and let him answer us back many things and I'll listen this is the prophet of God tell saying this right here he says many things and one of the horrible things that I do I try to do all the Talking oh my and not sit still long enough for him to answer me back that's true do all the talking and not sit still long enough for him to answer me back and it it made me think you ever have I got a guy that I work with it's not brother George I know you thinking that I know that's where you was going to go I work with brother George and Tucson and I know that's what Joel was thinking but you know I got a guy I work with and I will um he'll come in with a question and he he'll just be all all frazzled and needing to know the answer and about three words in I I probably can solve it I know where we're going with this but what usually happens is he talks the whole time and never stops talking the whole time and then by the end of it he's already walked out of the office and I didn't even say anything he didn't sit still long enough and let me just help him out a little bit come on you know you're sitting here taking up all your oxygen just just giving me all the info all I needed was three words buddy I didn't need anything else but he wouldn't sit still long enough and let me help him out and that's how we are sometimes with the Lord sit still long enough after you pray just sit there yeah keep them eyes closed keep that head bowed keep those knees on the floor and see if he don't come say something because I guarantee you he will I know he will he's done it for me he'll do it for you as he goes on he said we do that so many times in prayer he said I think if we would get off get off of our heart what's in it and express oursel to the Lord Jesus and then just kneel and just be still a while and just see what he would say back to us see just see what he would say back to us if we could let's turn to another scripture real quick it's in it's 2 Samuel it's 2 Samuel uh chapter 5 verses 17- 25 and uh on this scripture as well another little bit of background so on this scripture David he had just had some of the greatest victories in his life to date he had actually he had finally been made King over Israel and they had just captured back Jerusalem at this point in the scripture so this is 2 Samuel 5:1 17-2 it says but when the Philistines heard that they had anointed David King over Israel all the Philistines came up to seek David so that's just like the enemy today when he sees a blessing in your life or that you're on the verge of one or that you are all you you're just almost how it happens in I think it was more so old times you know there would be a stronghold in a battle and whoever held that stronghold it was known by both sides whoever held that they were probably going to win the war they were probably going to move forward and win it and so in your life when you you start approaching that stronghold when you in Christ when you're when you're just so close when you're laying in the presence of the Sun and you're just so close to that stronghold obtaining it you've waited and you've waited and you've waited the enemy is going to throw everything he can possibly throw at you because that's what happens in the battle you start approaching that stronghold and they are going to fire everything they've got at you because they know once you get there you're unstoppable they know once you get there they can't handle you anymore they're scared their fear comes into their heart it's not you being scared anymore you're you're inciting fear into them at that point they know you would be too hard to handle oh yeah that's good but it says all the Philistines came up to seek David and David heard of it and then went down to the hold says the Philistines also came and spread themselves in the valley of reim and David inquired of the Lord saying shall I go up to the Philistines wilt thou deliver them into mine hand yeah and the Lord said unto David go up for I will doubtless deliver the Philistines into thine hand so that's one of those victories we spoke of earlier it's kind of a one of these it's an immediate he he prayed David got his answer and he just went on to do it he just went and he gave the Philistines a whooping just directly says and David came to B pism and David smoked them there and said the Lord hath broken forth a upon mine enemies before me as the breach of waters therefore he called the name of that place ba pism and there and there they left their images and David and his men burned them oh and the Philistines came up yet again and spread themselves in the valley of reim and that notice they came back they had just gotten beat in this Valley the enemy that's right so he' been in this Valley and then they came back to the exact same Valley came back in the exact same Circumstance the exact same symptom in your life whatever it may be that he just the enemy returned directly back to that same exact spot yeah and when David inquired of the Lord he said Thou shalt not go up but fetch a compass behind them and come upon them over against the mulberry tree so David David's probably thinking why would the Lord say no this time I just beat this exact enemy in this exact spot yesterday why why is it known now why am I having to wait now I know I can obtain this Victory through you Lord why am I having to wait on this why do I have to go lay and wait you know David he was very he was a man that was very used to victory in his life he had had much Victory up to this point but it's but Victory it's it's it isn't always where the Lord teaches it's the time leading up to the victory is where the Lord teaches that's where he molds character that's where you're made and you're molded into something yes that's true when you're having to lay and weit and you feel under attack that's when your character is molded when you don't understand why you're going through what you're going through but you're going through it nonetheless the prophet says in the message conferences he said it's strange that how God will lead his children right into traps I'd never heard him say it like that before for said it's strange that how God will lead his children right into traps said sometimes wheelchairs sometimes with heart attacks sometimes he leads his children why to see what they'll act see see how see what a reaction they'll have on an action God wants to see how you're going to react in these things see what they'll do he says every son that comes to God must be tested and tried so the true test the true test didn't even even the trial or the battle you're going through the the true test is how we handle the battles that we're going through the things that are happening to us in our life that's the true test from our point of view it's the thing we're going through but from God's point of view it's how you're handling what you're going through and who you're handing it to and what you're doing with it in your life and another spot he says how David the great patriarch how we'd like to speak about him said we haven't time but and many times as we heard someone speaking a few moments ago about David and his sin but when all of it was forgiven when he was going to battle and we called in the world the chips were down he says and the opposition was great and David laid there under the tree and sweated it out oh yeah and I believe that's what we have to do sometimes we got to lay there under that tree of whatever the problem is and we got to sweat it out for a little while right we have to wait on God we have to see what God's going to do in this circumstance he said until he heard the sound going through the mulberry bushes then it was different he said David Rose and went on because that he had an absolute sir that he knew that God was going on before him he had that absolute the Lord had spoken he knew he was going before him but as David lay sweating it out you know there's a quote that says that David could he could feel the Philistines walking around him so if you picture this David's laying there probably covered up by something him and his men and it says that the enemy is so close he could feel him walking around him he could feel him everywhere he was all over him at this point oh and so that's the point just like in our lives that's when the what ifs start happening you know what if the Lord doesn't come David probably thought what if he just leaves me here what if what if the Lord Lord's left me as he did Saul what if he what if I'm not anointed anymore all these different what ifs start flying just flying into his head what if while we wait the enemy attacks what am I supposed to do the Lord hadn't told me that far he just said go lay and wait he just said wait on me to come through the mberry bushes up there then you think even farther into that well what's he going to do coming through the mberry bushes I need an army yeah I got to have strength to fight and he's wanting to come through the mber bushes but sometimes we don't always understand what's best for us we can't always see 20 steps ahead like we want to maybe the Lord has only given us vision for three steps ahead yeah sometimes in our lives that's what it can be like right right and David probably prayed there and I'm sure many of us have been here he probably he probably laid there and prayed and received nothing but silence but in reality the Lord had already told him what he was going to do here what should he receive he had the Lord's words on this subject on this thing in his life so I I I believe this was probably a patience test for David to see if he would try and take the situation into his own hands or if he would just let it be in the Lord's hands if he would just go lay in weight as he was supposed to and let the Lord have full control of this situation if he would surrender and let the Lord have it all oh yeah just a little test that the Lord was given him and from my my own personal experience the Lord molding patience into you it can get pretty uncomfortable it's not it's not fun if you pray for patience buckle your seat belt because everything is going to go wrong if you pray for patience and you're needing that in your life it's not going to it's not just going to magically drop from Heaven into you and you're going to have patience at that point no it's going to be molded into your character by tests by trials by maybe your own children by may maybe your maybe your wife at home I didn't mean that about my wife though if she watches this other guys wise not mine my wife would never mold my patience she's a sweetheart but that was close but these things in our these things in our lives they're just they're character Builders is what they are and I have a quote at the end I'd like to read it it struck me the other day I I'm not to it yet I need oh I want to jump to it but I'm not to it yet I'll read here in a second but sometimes our prayer life it can get quiet too and we're searching but there's no answer to be had and as the scripture continues verse 20 I think we're at verse 24 yeah verse 24 it says and let it be when thou hearest the sound of a going in the tops of the mulberry trees that then Thou shalt bester thyself for then shall the Lord go out before thee to Smite The Host of the Philistines and you know I imagine this moving through the mulberry trees I imagine it sounded a whole lot like a Russian Mighty Wind oh yeah moving through the top of them mberry trees I imagine that's what it sounded like on that day just the same wind as the day of Pentecost going through telling them you can have what you've waited for and it reminds me of the day of Pentecost because he just said wait until he didn't say wait four days then quit he didn't say wait five days then leave he said you wait until that takes some Faith you blindly go into an upper room and the Lord says you wait until come on he doesn't lay a big long plan out for him but he just says you wait until and they waited patiently and what they got for waiting patiently was the promise that had been given to them it was the Holy Ghost and that's what we must wait for sometimes whether it's the initial filling or whether it's a re in sometimes you just got to wait that's right and mold that patience Isaiah 4031 says but they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength they shall Mount up with wings as Eagles and you know eagles they go through this process called molting yes and it's when they shed everything down that's been weighing them down it's usually a more it's an older eagle and what it really is is a maturing process it's a physical maturing process they they start molting away their feathers they start breaking the crust off their beaks they just they they get young again is what they get come on but what that that eagle had to do was wait a long time for that period of molting to come but then when it finally comes they're renewed their strength is renewed they're like they were when they were young yeah come on they they they feel good again within themselves yes it says they shall run and not be weary and they shall walk and not faint right there's another scripture Matthew 14 if we could turn there Matthew 14: 22-33 and now keep in mind this scripture reading this this is after a great miracle and victory that the disciples had seen they had fed to 5,000 Jesus had they had just seen the Lord move in such a mighty way in their lives right like probably nothing had ever happened like this in the history of the world up until this point excuse me and it's verse 22 says and straight away Jesus constrained his disciples to get into a ship and to go before him unto the other side while he sent the multitude away and at this point how close they must have felt to the Lord after all they had done with him after all the victory they had just had with him verse 23 says and when he had sent the multitudes away he went up into a mountain apart to pray and when the evening was come he was there alone says but the ship was now in the midst of the sea tossed with waves for the wind was contrary and in Mark 6 when it's telling this same story it says that Jesus could see them toiling from the mountain I don't believe physically see them toiling but I believe spiritually he he saw them toiling just like he can see each and every one of us when we are toiling when the winds are contrary in our lives Jesus was watching yeah he never took his no matter how much it felt like he took his eyes off but we don't go off feeling no matter how much it felt like he didn't see him he was watching at all times and the 25th verse is what I want to focus on right here it says and in the Fourth Watch of the night Jesus went unto them walking on the sea so the Fourth Watch is the last watch of the night there's a first watch there's a second watch and there's a third watch and the fourth watch it's 3:00 a.m. to 6 a.m. in the morning and it makes me wonder about the questions they had this man Jesus that they had just they had just gotten into a boat because he told them to yeah and now we're out here on this sea the boats of about to flip over we're about to die and this man Jesus I thought he was the Messiah and we're out here all alone but he let him go until that Fourth Watch of the night come on especially in that Third Watch just think about it that the first watch second watch Third Watch and the boat just had to be almost tearing to pieces at this point and he was waiting to see if they would take it into their own hands if they would jump ship they say well I don't think we're too far from from the land maybe we'll jump out and we'll try and do it our way or maybe we'll paddle harder no you're fighting the air right you're fighting the air at that point oh come on if Jesus put you in that boat he's going to save you when you're in that boat he's not going to let he's not going to leave you he's not going to forsake you and just just let you get out on that sea now he might wait till the fourth watch but he's going to come on the scene yes sir it might be in the dark hour but he's going to come on the scene it might feel like all the chips are down but he's going to come on the scene we just have to trust that and we have to act accordingly that Faith show it show that you have that Faith keep walking forward don't confess against what God's told you about your life right don't confess against what Isaiah 53 says all the promises he's given you just move forward with it very wonderful the prophet says in separation from unbelief he says sometimes it's just when the darkest times come along in your life God's given you a little trial to see if you really do believe it that's right now that's simple but how many have been there he's given you a little trial to see if you really believe what his word says or not this is Elementary stuff but it's the truth and it happens whether you're 5 years old whether you're 55 years old whether you're 105 years old that's going to continue you until you get the new body until you go on that will continue in this age says when he really makes a thing known to you perfectly in another place he says may be your darkest hour don't worry Jesus will be alone it may be your darkest hour sister may be yours sister may be yours brother but don't worry Jesus will come along he's always there just in the darkest hours is that true how many can testify of that how many does testify of that should we testify of it more often should we give a word of encouragement to a brother or sister beside us and say when you see them struggling tell them what the Lord has done for you don't tell them how bad the sickness was tell them how great God was when he got you over the sickness yes sir tell them that as we go on in the scripture verse 26 and when the disciples saw him walking on the sea they were troubled saying it is a spirit and they cried out for fear they had a hard time recognizing that their victory was coming yeah yeah come on they were sitting there and their victory was walking straight towards them on water a miracle in itself and they couldn't see it because of fear they were scared the wind was contrary they didn't know what to do in this moment they were scared said but straight away Jesus spake unto them saying be of good cheer it is I Be not Afraid and Peter answered him and said Lord if it be thou bid me come come unto thee on the water and he said come and when Peter was come down out of the ship he walked on the water to go to Jesus but when he saw the wind boisterous he was afraid and beginning to sink he cried saying Lord save me you know they they waited on the Lord Peter waited on the Lord till the fourth watch but and the Lord he sees him walking on water but then the first sign of danger we want to plant our foot and head back the other way we want to go we're not the we're not the children of Israel coming out of Egypt and getting out here and having a hard time and and saying well we might as well have stayed in Egypt we might as well have stayed under bondage that's not us we're the Bride of Jesus Christ that is not us we don't have to do that we don't have to deal with that verse 31 says and immediately just like in so many of our lives and immediately Jesus stretched forth his hand and caught him and said unto him oh thou of little faith wherefore D thou doubt yeah and when they were coming to the ship the wind ceased then they that were in the ship came and worshiped him saying of a truth Thou Art the Son of God thank you Lord the prophet goes on in the message the resurrection of jy's daughter he says now the Son of God spent much time in prayer before the cross and a healing the people that's right so you mean that Jesus spent time in prayer and waiting you mean that even Jesus had to wait he prayed oh it makes me wonder if if he got tired sometimes and stopped praying and just started complaining oh I've done it many of times you get deep in prayer but then you feel like you're getting where so you want to stop praying and start complaining you want to replace one with the other he goes on he says what just prior to our message tonight he crossed all the way across the sea went up on top of a mountain one evening after breaking bread and feeding 5,000 I wonder where he got the atoms or what Atom he turned loose rather when he fed 5,000 people with two little fishes and five loaves of bread five little biscuits and some that some little child had not only was the fish fish but it was cooked fish and cooked bread he'll go above and beyond what you even think your Victory is you think you know what the victory is but then God comes on the scene and he doubles it job went through what he went through and then his portion was greater after the after the battles after the strain after not knowing what to do right it was bigger yeah thank the Lord he goes on he says he done something no one knows yet but he did it because he was the Lord of creation and there upon the mountain he stood and watched the disciples as they was crossing the Sea The Little boat tossed about and just about ready to sink looked like and they seen someone coming and hear he come walking on the sea says about that's the way he does just about the time it gets very darkest of hour then Jesus comes along says we fret and worry we Christians right and the maybe get sick or something happens or somebody don't show up we're just so nervous and upset we should just sit quiet he's the one who commanded it we're living under his dispensation living under his grace thank God we are living under his grace that's right it says just sit still he'll be a after a while don't worry he'll open up a healing service somewhere or you'd be guided to somebody who pray for the sick when you got sickness listen to this this is shocking if not he'll just put it upon your heart so bad you'll just kneel down in the room and ask him about it yourself that's right so just remember he works all things together for good you don't have to wait on a healing service you don't have to wait on anything you don't have to wait on any man to do something for you because God's the one that's going to do it no matter if the man's there praying for you or if you're knelt beside your bed yeah it's the same God in both moments don't think you got to wait for some special preacher to come pray for you you can get down in your room in your prayer closet and you can do the pray in yourself you can pray through show God that you have the faith show him that that favor that he had for you that Grace that he put upon you for you to go through this test don't let it come out void but show him that you're made for that show them that he's made you for that that you can conquer anything through Christ that the enemy sends your way yes and then when you do it when that Miracle comes that healing comes just show it to the enemy yeah just show it to them we got a brother and sister in our church talking about the miracle being greater when it comes brother will and sister Lindsay they recently just got married and the doctor had told her that she could she couldn't have children the doctor had told her that that she there was just just straight no way it was happening and so brother Israel my pastor he was preaching I think one evening service on Abraham and Sarah and they both were sitting there and they just heard that and they just took it they just grabbed a hold of that promise and they said Lord this is in your this is your word now we're going to take a hold of this scripture right here and it's ours and I believe we can have that baby and now little will the baby that they've already had they can take to every church and they can say this this is that miracle that just got greater and greater and greater and now when the enemy tries to tell them something they can point back to little will and say what about that Miracle what about that you're saying I can't have this new one but what about that one that's a child that was born when the doctor said I couldn't have children what about that devil smack him in the face when he comes around smack him with your Miracle see if he likes it amen say I lost my play I if not oh i' done with that that quote but in closing now I'd just like to read that that quote it's from the sman church age and it really with the wise we go through stuff with different things it really opened my eyes to it why we a lot of people preach on about struggle and trials and tests but this when I saw this I just it really hit home to why we have to go through these things cuz sometimes it's hard to realize the why it's hard to realize why we have to wait even why do we have to be tried why would a God that that loves us so deeply as he said make us wait why would he do this stuff why would he care about how I react waiting on him why would he care about that come on this is it's in the sman church age and musicians you can go ahead and come up it says you see they could not figure out God's love they thought that love meant no suffering they thought that love meant a baby with parental care but God said that his love was elective love the proof of his love is election that no matter what happened his love was proven truly by the fact that they were chosen unto salvation thank you Lord he may commit you to death as he did Paul he may commit you to suffer uffing as he did job that is his prerogative he is Sovereign but it is all with a purpose if he did not have a purp I believe brother Ben might have spoke on that a little bit this morning about the purpose that is his prerogative he is Sovereign but it is all with a purpose if he did not have a purpose then he would be the author of frustration and not of Peace his purpose is that after we have suffered a while we would be made perfect be established strengthened and settled as job said he puts strengthen us but when when did the when did the Lord give job his strength after he had waited some time after he had went through what he was ordained to go through what he had to go through that's when he received his strength says you see he himself suffered now this is talking about the Lord right here he learned obedience the Lord Jesus Christ he learned obedience by the things that he suffered think about that he was actually made perfect by the things that he suffered thank you Lord says Hebrews 5: 8-9 though he were a son yet he learned yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered and being made perfect he became the author of etern the author of Eternal salvation unto all them that obey him in plain language the very character of Jesus was perfected by Suffering The Very character of Jesus the character that we want was perfected by suffering so if it was perfected by suffering in Jesus what makes us think that it it won't be perfected in the same way in us why would we be any different why would we have an easier road if it was perfected that way in our Lord and savior and according to Paul he has left his church a measure of suffering that they too by their faith in God while suffering for him would come to a place of perfection why did he want this James 1: 2-4 says my brethren counted all joy when you fall into diverse Temptations who counts it Joy when you fall into Temptations come on no hands went up on that one last one was a lot of hands that one no hands said knowing this at the trying of your faith worketh patience but let patience have her perfect work that ye may be perfect and entire wanting nothing then it says why does he stand by the reason is in Romans 8:17 and 18 and if children then heirs Heirs of God and Joint heirs with Christ if so be that we suffer with him that we may be also glorified together for I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in US says unless we suffer with him we cannot reign with him that's good you have to suffer to Reign the reason for this is that character simply is never made without suffering now listen to this next part this is what really struck me character is a victory not a gift character is a victory character is earned character is not just given it don't just drop down it is earned through sufferings not a gift but a victory says a man without character can't Reign because power apart from character is satanic but Power with character is fit to rule and since he wants us to share even his throne on the same basis that he overcame and to sit down in his father's throne then we have to overcome to sit with him and the little temporary suffering we go through now is not worthy to be compared to the tremendous Glory that will be revealed in us when he comes oh what Treasures are laid up for those who are willing to enter into his kingdom through much tribulation think it not strange concerning the fiery trials that are to try you that is what Peter said is it strange that God wants us to develop a Christlike character that comes through suffering no sir and we all have trials we are all tried and chastened his sons not one but goes through that now listen to this line the church that is not suffering and is not
