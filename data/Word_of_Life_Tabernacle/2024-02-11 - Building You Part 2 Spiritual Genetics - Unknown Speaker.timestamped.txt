[16:36] amen you enjoy that that special this
[16:38] morning amen amen let's sing that song
[16:42] if we could you are my
[16:44] refuge I was I was looking you see me
[16:47] get on my phone there I was trying to
[16:48] find this quote that I read the other
[16:49] day and I didn't want to misquote it but
[16:51] it was um it says uh true true greatness
[16:55] requires responsibility and so you know
[16:57] I was thinking about that this morning
[16:59] when I was I was running really really
[17:01] late this morning by the way and it was
[17:02] kind of my fault I told Jen I was like
[17:04] let's sit on the couch 10 more minutes
[17:05] and have our coffee and just kind of
[17:07] ease into the day you know and so you
[17:09] know then I got running behind and then
[17:11] I was kind of uh kind of in the back
[17:14] just rushing around real quick and you
[17:16] know I kind of that quote came kind of
[17:18] came back to me I was like you know if
[17:20] if I'm going to have a good service
[17:21] today you know it's my responsibility
[17:23] you know if if I want a great service
[17:25] it's my responsibility and so you know
[17:27] when you're worshiping you're not
[17:29] worshiping the song leader or the
[17:30] preacher but you're you're worshiping to
[17:32] him so if you want to have a great
[17:33] service it's it's really on you and we
[17:35] can do we can do as much as we want and
[17:37] I can try as hard as I can the musicians
[17:39] can play great but really it comes back
[17:42] to us how good of a service do we want
[17:44] to have and so if you want to have a
[17:46] good service this morning guess what

[30:00] people that are coming up it's good for
[30:02] the younger ones to hear that it's a
[30:04] it's good for us parents to hear it and
[30:06] uh and we're just going to talk about
[30:08] those things and kind of the guidelines
[30:09] that are set for us by the message of
[30:12] the hour and uh we're so thankful to
[30:14] have our young people aren't we and and
[30:16] have as many kids as we do around but uh
[30:18] we just want to we just want to always
[30:21] preach the word and teach the word and
[30:23] tell the people the truth and and then
[30:25] we believe the holy spirit will guide
[30:26] each and every life to to the truth so
[30:29] we'll do that this afternoon the Lord
[30:30] willing 1 John 5
[30:32] And1 it says whosoever believeth that
[30:35] Jesus is the Christ is born of God and
[30:39] everyone that loveth him that begat
[30:42] loveth him also that is begotten of him
[30:45] so he's saying you can't say I love God
[30:48] and I hate my neighbor you can't say I
[30:50] love God and I hate my wife or my
[30:52] husband you can't say I love God and I
[30:55] hate the church right because everyone
[30:58] that loveth him that begat loveth him
[31:00] also that is begotten of him by this we
[31:03] know that we love the children of God
[31:05] when we love God and keep his
[31:08] Commandments this is the love of God
[31:11] that we keep his Commandments and his
[31:13] Commandments are not Grievous for
[31:16] whatsoever is born of God overcometh the
[31:20] worlden whatever is born of God
[31:23] overcometh the world and this is the
[31:25] victory over over cometh the world even
[31:29] our faith faith is our Victory God bless
[31:32] you this morning you may be
[31:35] seated I heard a story of a professor in
[31:38] a a seminary who took his students to a
[31:41] mega church
[31:42] to uh to go and see how they did things
[31:46] and kind of get them used to a church
[31:47] environment in that way and go into this
[31:50] church and cleaning up after the service
[31:52] the only one there's the janitor so he
[31:54] begins talking to the janitor and the
[31:56] janitor standing there and he said it
[31:58] looks like you had a a good crowd today
[32:00] he said yeah he said we processed about
[32:02] a th000
[32:04] units you know I I don't believe that's
[32:07] the way we ought to look at God's
[32:09] people I don't believe that's the way we
[32:11] ought to look at one another we're not
[32:13] units we're not we're not numbers each
[32:16] one of us individually God cares about
[32:19] am God loves you for who you are
[32:22] individually and he cares about you as
[32:25] an individual I want you to understand
[32:26] that you young people that are here I I
[32:28] want you to understand matne God loves
[32:30] you and cares about you and knew who you
[32:32] were even before you were born and so we
[32:35] we dealt with that Wednesday night with
[32:37] election and and and predestination how
[32:40] that God David said he knew me even in
[32:43] my mother's womb he said he covered me
[32:46] in my mother's womb he protected me and
[32:48] we find out that we weren't just
[32:50] protected from our mother's womb but we
[32:52] were actually a protected thought of God
[32:56] that we were brother random taught us we
[32:57] were in his thoughts and we're actually
[33:00] a protected thought of God that ought to
[33:02] give us great courage today that ought
[33:04] to give us great confidence as we Face
[33:06] life and as we Face the things that are
[33:08] going on all around us as we begin to
[33:10] see that yes I may have a struggle I I
[33:12] might have issues to deal with in my
[33:14] life my my children may not always do
[33:16] what I want them to do my the people
[33:18] around me may not always act like they
[33:19] should but I know I'm protected by God I
[33:22] know that my path of life is covered by
[33:25] him
[33:27] and so the message teaches us that he
[33:29] teaches us that brother random teaches
[33:31] us that God deals with us as
[33:34] individuals not just as he said he deals
[33:37] with Israel as a nation but he deals
[33:39] with the Gentile as an individual so he
[33:43] deals with with Brother Bill and sister
[33:45] Karen individually not just as a couple
[33:47] he deals with you individually he deals
[33:49] with me individually not just as a
[33:51] pastor not just as a husband not just as
[33:53] a as a father but he deals with me as an
[33:56] indiv individual and he and he's
[33:58] watching over me every minute of the day
[34:01] and so we found out even job said he
[34:03] counts my
[34:04] steps so he knows exactly how many steps
[34:07] are between you and the Rapture he he
[34:09] was watching Enoch's life and he knew
[34:11] exactly how many steps were between him
[34:14] and the going home and I tell you what
[34:16] he knows exactly we don't know but he
[34:18] knows we don't know what tomorrow holds
[34:21] but he knows what tomorrow
[34:23] holds and so I'm willing to leave that
[34:25] in his hands
[34:27] God is building us as individuals
[34:29] brother brand said we are God deals with
[34:30] us as individuals to make us a
[34:32] Powerhouse for God so brother brandom
[34:36] says this in the sign of his time sign
[34:37] of this time he says God deals for
[34:40] today that's important God deals for
[34:43] today he said what he does tomorrow is
[34:46] up to him sir and so many people get
[34:48] wrapped up in what God is going to do
[34:50] tomorrow but he says God deals for today
[34:54] right he's interested in today so many
[34:56] times we get even as preachers and I get
[34:58] caught up in it too you get thinking
[34:59] about what's going to happen tomorrow
[35:01] and dealing with what the church is
[35:02] going to be tomorrow but we've got to
[35:04] deal with what the church is today God
[35:06] still heals the sick he still Saves The
[35:08] Lost he he still does what he promised
[35:10] he would do his word is still true even
[35:13] though we're at the end time we still
[35:15] believe that our sick can be healed we
[35:16] still believe our children can be raised
[35:18] in the fear and admonition of the lord
[35:20] we still believe the church is
[35:21] functional as a unit why because God
[35:23] deals for today sir and he always deals
[35:27] with us he said with an individual
[35:30] because groups of men have too many
[35:34] ideas right oh isn't that the
[35:37] truth and so he deals with one man in a
[35:42] generation cause one man to be a
[35:46] prophet and the word is as a conduit
[35:49] comes through that one man and you'll
[35:52] find and I didn't bring up the
[35:53] scriptures but just from memory but
[35:55] you'll find in when God dealt with
[35:57] Samuel when he begin to deal with Samuel
[35:59] at a young age the prophet the Bible
[36:01] tells us in 1 Samuel he said there was
[36:03] no open Vision there was no open Vision
[36:06] there what that means if you go and
[36:07] break it down it means that it means
[36:09] that there was no broken Revelation
[36:11] other words they didn't know they had
[36:13] the book of Moses but they didn't know
[36:14] what was supposed to be going on for
[36:15] their day I'm so glad we don't live in a
[36:17] time like that we live in a time when
[36:19] there is an open Vision that come by a
[36:21] prophet the last prophet to the
[36:24] age right what brother Brandon that we
[36:26] believe believe that he was the seventh
[36:27] angel now now so we know that we have an
[36:30] open Vision but but without an open
[36:33] Vision the people perish but but with an
[36:35] open Vision we know what God is doing
[36:38] today the vision has been broken for
[36:41] today I'm so glad for that so it wasn't
[36:44] with a group of men but it was with one
[36:47] man the B said God dealt with Wesley
[36:50] dealt with Luther and then he dealt with
[36:52] our prophet he dealt with one man at a
[36:54] time for a generation and then through
[36:57] that man he reveals he reveals the word
[37:01] and then we're to take that and believe
[37:03] it and follow it how many you believe
[37:05] that today now brother brandom said he's
[37:08] still God just as much God as he ever
[37:12] was how many believe that oh he's just
[37:15] as much God today as he ever was if he
[37:18] ever healed the sick he does today if he
[37:20] can ever heal cancer he he will today if
[37:22] he can ever heal if he can ever bring my
[37:25] family bring them under the subjection
[37:26] of the word he does it
[37:28] today whatever he has done he will do
[37:32] he's just as much God he said but how
[37:34] can a man say those things unless God
[37:36] tells him first to say it he said God
[37:39] tells him to say it see not under
[37:41] impression all right see we we don't go
[37:43] by impression I don't just sit back
[37:46] there and say what Lord I'm just being
[37:47] impressed to say something no I believe
[37:49] in Inspiration I'm preaching by
[37:51] inspiration but it's inspiration of the
[37:53] word it's because I've lay before the
[37:55] message of the hour and and read what
[37:57] brother brandom said read what the Bible
[37:59] says that's that's what I can't just
[38:01] come out here under impression and
[38:02] preach to you because I can pretty much
[38:04] go anywhere under
[38:05] impression right under impression I
[38:07] could just come out and Hammer somebody
[38:09] come out and and and preach at people
[38:11] and and hurt people and but the only way
[38:13] I can help people is by preaching the
[38:16] word right so we don't preach impression
[38:19] we preach thus sayth the
[38:20] Lord we got something better than an
[38:22] impression we got something better than
[38:25] Pentecostalism we got something better
[38:27] than just what our neighbor said or our
[38:28] uncle said or some story somebody told
[38:31] we've got the word of the
[38:33] Lord and we preach that yes so he says
[38:38] not just under impression but you know
[38:40] what you're saying then do it he said
[38:42] but wait don't try to say oh that's the
[38:43] way many people he said I think in gifts
[38:46] of God he said wait to know it is you
[38:48] know it's God wait till the voice comes
[38:50] and you hear it and know it see it he
[38:52] said then you can say it's thus sayith
[38:53] the Lord he said if it isn't thus sayith
[38:56] the Lord than it's your impression it's
[38:58] what somebody else
[38:59] thinks he said people request people say
[39:02] this for me do this for me he said how
[39:05] can you do it if you're honest with God
[39:07] until God first tells you he said how
[39:09] can I tell you thus sayth Jack Moore and
[39:11] Jack Moore hasn't said nothing to me he
[39:13] said it's got to come first from God all
[39:15] right not impressed he said it's got to
[39:18] be God and then it will happen for it is
[39:19] then thus sayth the lord it's not an
[39:22] impression brother BR talks about
[39:23] interpretation of tongues we believe in
[39:24] tongues we believe in interpretation but
[39:26] interpretation of tongues is not an
[39:28] impression you hear it and repeat what
[39:31] you
[39:32] heard right and so that's not just an
[39:34] impression and I'm going somewhere with
[39:36] this because we need to understand that
[39:38] God has dealt with an individual in our
[39:40] day and then that individual see each
[39:42] one of us is responsible as an
[39:44] individual to that
[39:46] message this is what we were predestined
[39:49] for this is what we were called to this
[39:51] is who we
[39:54] are so he said it's th sayith the Lord
[39:57] he said he said wait till the voice
[39:59] comes and if you don't it's what
[40:00] somebody else thinks he said it's got to
[40:03] come first from God he said not
[40:05] impressed well I wish I could lose some
[40:07] weight and start keeping my coat
[40:10] on he said it's got to be God I I get
[40:14] sweaty up here but I also get sweaty
[40:15] tying my shoes
[40:20] so it's all
[40:23] right he said it's got to come first
[40:26] from God not impressed it's got to be
[40:28] God and then it will happen for it is
[40:30] then thus sayith the Lord sir he said
[40:33] now everybody won't have
[40:35] that now listen no sir I'd love to be
[40:39] able to just follow what everybody tells
[40:41] me but I can't do it I'd love to be able
[40:43] to just do whatever somebody else that's
[40:44] successful what they said but I can't do
[40:47] it because there was one to a generation
[40:49] one to a generation not two or five or
[40:52] 25 but one he said everybody won't have
[40:55] that won't be that way it never was that
[40:57] way it never will be that way God deals
[41:00] with an individual he did in the days of
[41:01] Noah he did in the days of Joshua he did
[41:03] in the days of Moses he has always
[41:05] someone say always he has never made a
[41:08] system it's been an individual cuz two
[41:10] men ain't alike no time see he never did
[41:13] no more but everybody didn't have to be
[41:15] Moses that's a great Revelation to have
[41:18] I don't have to be Moses I don't have to
[41:20] be a prophet they didn't understand it
[41:22] they just followed right he said of the
[41:24] Holy Spirit of a man is Anointed of God
[41:26] God will direct you to follow the Holy
[41:28] Spirit and the Bible for he's the one
[41:30] who does these things he said Jesus
[41:32] Christ in the form of the Holy Ghost
[41:34] working in the people you believe he
[41:36] still works
[41:37] today but he works with individuals he
[41:39] worked with an individual prophet he
[41:41] works with you as an individual makes
[41:43] you responsible to the message for
[41:45] yourself right sir right not just under
[41:48] me but for yourself he said my pastor's
[41:49] a good man well I hope I am but that's
[41:51] not I don't have any bearing on you you
[41:54] you've got to be responsible to the
[41:55] message
[41:56] right well my my my mama has the Holy
[41:59] Ghost but that don't mean you have it
[42:02] right you have to get it for yourself
[42:04] it's the same Faith your mama has for
[42:05] it's the same Faith you can have right
[42:08] amen now he said but brother brand said
[42:11] everybody didn't have to be Moses there
[42:13] was one individual there were seven
[42:15] stars in his hand right Seven Stars in
[42:19] his hand one star for each age one star
[42:23] for this
[42:24] age an indiv idual who preached thus
[42:27] sayith the Lord right oh my and we have
[42:31] thus sayith the Lord when we say what he
[42:32] said and I understand he was human I
[42:35] understand he was a man I understand he
[42:36] was fallible as a man but he was the
[42:38] channel the channel that God used the
[42:40] only channel that God used for this age
[42:43] period if we don't believe that we don't
[42:45] believe the
[42:46] message right he was the individual sent
[42:49] to you now I want you to understand that
[42:51] this message I want us to make it
[42:52] personal again we we look at it as
[42:54] something well I filter the message
[42:56] through my church I filter it through
[42:57] this side or the other it needs to be
[42:59] personal to you again you need to
[43:00] understand that God sent you Elijah the
[43:02] prophet to restore you back to be in
[43:05] that condition again he sent you Elijah
[43:08] he sent me Elijah that's why I was able
[43:10] to come out of the background I come
[43:11] from that's why I was able to overcome
[43:13] so many challenges in life because I've
[43:15] seen God sent me the message of the hour
[43:18] and that same power is here for you God
[43:21] sent you the message of the hour you
[43:23] have the ability to live it you have the
[43:25] ability to believe
[43:28] it and then no one overrides that that's
[43:31] individual the message is for you if the
[43:35] messenger to the age and I'm dealing
[43:37] with this then we'll move on but if the
[43:39] messenger to the age set guidelines for
[43:40] the church when it comes to church order
[43:42] and discipline that's why we have church
[43:44] the way we do that's right you can do
[43:46] whatever you want to but for us we're
[43:48] going to have church because that's what
[43:50] he told us to
[43:51] do if you think you have authority to
[43:54] override that I'll say what brother BR
[43:55] said to Junior Jackson I'm not going to
[43:57] disfellowship you or say you're wrong
[43:59] but that's your troubles but that's for
[44:01] us that's for me in my house and what
[44:03] I'm responsible for we will stay under a
[44:06] Vindicated Prophet I love the way Joshua
[44:09] puts that he said if it seem evil unto
[44:10] you to serve the Lord choose you this
[44:12] day whom you will serve whether the gods
[44:15] which your father served or on the other
[44:16] side of the flood or the gods of the
[44:18] amorites in whose land you dwell but as
[44:20] for me in my house we will serve the
[44:22] Lord every one of us ought to make that
[44:23] statement today as for me I will serve
[44:26] this the Lord I will believe the
[44:28] [Applause]
[44:30] message how did he serve the Lord by
[44:32] saying what Moses said he said he said
[44:36] bind this law obey it believe it amen
[44:39] preach it amen we're doing the same
[44:42] thing now we are individually
[44:45] responsible listen brother brand said
[44:46] God never did deal with a group nowh in
[44:48] the scripture he deals with one
[44:50] individual because every man is
[44:52] different from the other that's right
[44:55] now but Joel's not here this morning so
[44:56] I'll pick on
[44:57] him I pick on him when he is here
[45:01] too but God don't deal with a group
[45:03] because we're
[45:04] different right there could only be one
[45:07] one guy's the pastor and the other one's
[45:09] not right and the reason for that is
[45:12] because we're
[45:13] different right and and he's a singer
[45:17] and I'm
[45:18] not right he can preach ways I wish I
[45:21] could preach I wish I could preach
[45:23] sometimes like Joel does he he's
[45:25] preaching this morning up in in Salem
[45:27] doing a wonderful job but but he can't
[45:29] be me and I can't be him God don't deal
[45:31] with groups he deals individually and
[45:33] yet we work together right brother
[45:36] Stuart that's here with us that has gone
[45:38] today but brother Stewart works with me
[45:40] as a as my partner here in the church
[45:43] and preaching the word of God but I
[45:44] don't go to brother Stuart and tell him
[45:46] what to preach well the people need this
[45:48] and and they need to hear that no he
[45:49] hears that from God right he deals with
[45:52] God directly and so as an individual
[45:55] we're individ ually responsible for what
[45:57] we say across this Pulpit we're
[45:59] individually responsible but we're very
[46:00] different we come from the same parents
[46:03] but we're very different and I want to
[46:05] get into that this morning brother Rand
[46:06] said every man our thumbs are different
[46:08] hold your thumb your your your thumb up
[46:11] your thumb is different from everybody
[46:13] else in the
[46:15] church right our noses are different
[46:18] someone said
[46:21] amen our noses are different our actions
[46:26] are different aren't you glad of that
[46:28] we're not all the same he said he gets
[46:30] one man he can get him perfectly in
[46:32] harmony till he can become that word God
[46:36] help us today
[46:37] now we've got I want to call this today
[46:42] spiritual
[46:43] genetics spiritual genetics because our
[46:46] genes brother random begins to deal with
[46:49] genes in in the message late in the
[46:51] message in 1964 and
[46:53] 1965 genetics is a study of how genes
[46:55] and traits are passed down from one
[46:58] generation to the other so I I got a
[47:00] picture and I don't know if I can read
[47:01] that but I it's and so your body's made
[47:04] up of cells and just hang with me for a
[47:07] minute it'll be okay your body's made up
[47:09] of cells each cell has a chromosome
[47:12] every chromosome contains DNA in your
[47:14] DNA is genes and then your genes is what
[47:17] carries your traits so what kind of
[47:20] music that you like what uh uh what what
[47:22] smells good to you and what doesn't and
[47:25] everybody is different because they've
[47:26] got different genes and then even people
[47:28] with identical genes those genes might
[47:30] be expressed differently through what
[47:33] they call nature and nurture as you go
[47:35] through life that that actually changes
[47:37] now uh Humans Beings have approximately
[47:40] 24,000 different types of
[47:43] genes and the genes make up your DNA
[47:46] they give you your eye color your hair
[47:47] color right now if you remember from
[47:50] Wednesday night brother brandom told us
[47:52] he said Oh my he said he knew your
[47:55] haircut color before you were ever
[47:57] born he knew your hair color before you
[48:01] were ever born so it's our genes that
[48:03] make up our DNA and within a gene what a
[48:05] gene is is a set of
[48:07] instructions it's actually you could say
[48:10] a word that controls your life it's a
[48:12] set of instructions that that control
[48:14] your life so it tells brother Danny's
[48:16] going to have a deep voice and and there
[48:18] was a gene that told that that gave
[48:20] instructions to his body to build in
[48:23] such a way that it would be he would
[48:25] have a deep voice and and certain men
[48:27] will have a real high uh high pitched
[48:29] voice and and some women will look
[48:32] differently and men will look
[48:33] differently and different eye color
[48:35] different hair color why because those
[48:36] genes Express themselves in different
[48:38] ways now and and and they carry that you
[48:41] carry that from your
[48:42] ancestors so uh so now you have uh 23
[48:46] pairs of chromosomes and inside those
[48:48] chromosomes is the it's the genes now
[48:51] the word Gene was not invented until
[48:53] 1909 I thought that was interesting 1909
[48:56] the Year brother Brandon was born it
[48:58] didn't crack the genetic code until
[49:01] 1966 but I want you to notice what we
[49:04] read in in our uh in our first scripture
[49:06] 1 John 5:4 whatsoever is born of God
[49:10] yeah so in other words whatever carries
[49:13] the genetics of God now think about it
[49:16] now we're talking spiritually now not
[49:19] naturally but we know that God even even
[49:22] compassed us naturally even even
[49:24] naturally he chose us to be what we are
[49:27] you can go things that are to be listen
[49:29] to things that are to be brother brandom
[49:30] deals with that over and over again he
[49:31] said even even he put you in an area
[49:34] that you would like said if you like
[49:36] mountains he put you in a m Mountain
[49:38] Area you know like that you just think
[49:40] wow God could actually do that caused me
[49:42] to be born in a certain place a certain
[49:44] time he said he prepared for your
[49:46] arrival even in the natural you think he
[49:50] doesn't care about you today you think
[49:51] he doesn't see what you're going through
[49:53] you think he don't see that your grocery
[49:54] bills coming do you know you think he
[49:56] doesn't see that you got that credit
[49:58] card you can't pay off he sees it today
[50:00] he knows about it so now we find out
[50:04] that the spirit in our spiritual
[50:06] genetics if we're born of God we
[50:09] overcome the
[50:11] world right not not that we might
[50:13] overcome or maybe overcome but we do
[50:16] overcome sir whatever is born of God
[50:20] whatever is the spiritual genetics of
[50:22] God overcomes the world now if you're
[50:26] born again today it's because you were
[50:29] in the thoughts of God before the
[50:31] foundation of the earth Brother Band
[50:34] said it never started on any day sir
[50:36] remember we read this you wasn't saved
[50:38] on any day you was always saved he said
[50:41] Jesus just come to redeem that but you
[50:43] were saved from the beginning because
[50:45] you had eternal life to begin with oh
[50:49] I'm so glad for this message that taught
[50:50] us these things now when you were born
[50:52] on the Earth there was already a
[50:54] spiritual germ of life a seed or a gene
[50:57] that come from God and we read this as
[50:58] well Psalms 139:13 but he said you have
[51:01] possessed my Reigns and we found out
[51:04] those Reigns that's that's what your
[51:06] impulse that's your heart it's a word
[51:08] that it's a hebraism actually for
[51:10] kidneys it means your innermost being
[51:12] your Reigns the innermost man and we
[51:15] know we're a Triune being brother B said
[51:18] look here you're an outside person you
[51:19] have five senses that contacts that
[51:22] outside body God gave you five senses
[51:24] not to contact him but your Earthly home
[51:26] see taste feel smell and hear you have a
[51:29] spirit on the inside of that he has five
[51:31] Outlets conscience and love and so forth
[51:33] five Outlets that you contact the spirit
[51:35] world with that but with your spirit he
[51:37] said your physical context to physical
[51:39] your spiritual context is spiritual but
[51:41] inside of that you've got a soul and
[51:43] that soul is that Gene that come from
[51:46] God now think about oh my think about if
[51:49] in our natural genetics he tells us he
[51:51] said even in my mother's womb even my my
[51:54] rain so in other words he knows the
[51:55] color of your hair he knows everything
[51:56] about you and he chose you to be the way
[51:58] that you
[51:59] are right but then in my spiritual genes
[52:02] I come from God so I'm going back to God
[52:05] I come from God so I'll overcome the
[52:08] world are you with me now so now he says
[52:12] it's a that soul is that Gene that come
[52:14] from God and like a baby formed in its
[52:17] mother's womb when the baby comes into
[52:19] the mother's womb by the little germ it
[52:20] crawls into the egg it doesn't form one
[52:23] cell of human the next a dog the next a
[52:25] cat the next a horse he said it's all
[52:27] human cells because it's building off of
[52:30] an original human cell and when a man
[52:32] has been born again by the word of God
[52:34] predestinated to eternal life called the
[52:37] elected it'll be word of God on top of
[52:40] word word on word so don't get
[52:44] discouraged with where you're at see
[52:46] originally the gene when it's first born
[52:48] it's just a it's just like a like like a
[52:50] single cell but every time it builds
[52:53] another cell every time it builds
[52:55] another cell it's going to build more of
[52:57] God right it don't build a monkey today
[53:00] and a dog tomorrow but it builds human
[53:02] cell after human cell it builds more of
[53:04] God and more of God and more of God
[53:06] that's how you know if you're born again
[53:08] that's how you know you have the Holy
[53:09] Ghost how because you're just building
[53:10] more and more and more and more of God
[53:12] every time you come across the word you
[53:14] say yes Lord that's me that's for me
[53:17] healing is for me peace is for me
[53:19] salvation is for me in my house that's
[53:22] for
[53:23] me what's it doing it's building more of
[53:26] God amen
[53:29] amen hallelujah we don't want to get
[53:32] discouraged cuz people change churches
[53:36] change atmospheres change people come in
[53:39] go out things the message the way the
[53:43] people do things change but God doesn't
[53:46] change right so we always want to go
[53:49] back to the word what we want to feed on
[53:51] is the word but the B said you're not
[53:52] feeding on the words of a man you're
[53:54] feeding on the failing body word of the
[53:56] son of man amen right so you want to
[53:58] feed on it keep building it keep
[54:00] building it he said he said not a
[54:04] denominational Creed and then a word and
[54:07] a Creed it won't work sir you can't have
[54:10] that Len in
[54:12] it so I can't afford with the Joe to
[54:15] build the church or an individual in the
[54:18] church or my own life on my thoughts
[54:22] plus the
[54:23] message my thoughts plus the Bible I
[54:26] can't do
[54:27] that right because whatever the word is
[54:31] that has to be what's added that's
[54:33] what's added to that original cell so
[54:37] when you don't see growth whenever you
[54:38] don't see growth in your life you need
[54:39] to look at what you've been adding what
[54:42] you've been feeding on yes if you want
[54:45] to see more growth how many you want to
[54:46] see more growth in your own life Lord I
[54:48] want to grow up I want to be I want to
[54:49] be a mature son or daughter of God I
[54:51] want to live right I want to do and I
[54:52] know I know you do but you want to do
[54:54] that more you want to have more patience
[54:56] and more faith and more godliness more
[54:58] of all these virtues maybe we'll get
[55:00] into later but but well you you want to
[55:02] have more of all of that well how do you
[55:03] do that well you're partakers of the
[55:05] divine nature right that's been
[55:07] deposited into you by the Holy Ghost how
[55:09] do you how do you get more of it brother
[55:11] B say it's like a tree it just drinks
[55:12] more water and it pushes out limbs it
[55:15] drinks more water and it pushes out
[55:17] limbs you drinking more of the word and
[55:19] you push out another limb you drink in
[55:21] more of the word you push out another
[55:22] Limb and pretty soon you become ready
[55:24] for a rapture
[55:25] amen are are you with me
[55:28] now so we want to be a mature church we
[55:30] ought to be mature bride
[55:35] now now said brother Ben I I don't know
[55:40] and sometimes we get scared we think
[55:42] well I don't know how I'm going to ever
[55:45] live a Christian Life and sometimes we
[55:46] make excuses for ourselves well well you
[55:48] know the message is hard and in the
[55:51] message I know I can't I'm supposed to
[55:53] be C conduct my marriage a certain way
[55:56] supposed to do these things a certain
[55:58] way with my finances supposed to do
[55:59] these things a certain way I'm just
[56:01] talking to you this morning but in the
[56:03] message this is way I'm supposed to do
[56:04] you think well I can't really do that no
[56:07] you can do
[56:08] that you how we know that you can
[56:11] because the
[56:13] instructions are in the
[56:17] gene right so the word oh my the word
[56:22] that comes to you matches the word on
[56:25] the
[56:26] inside right so when that seed is
[56:29] awakened by the Holy Spirit what happens
[56:31] in your life is you that that Gene
[56:34] begins to express what for you
[56:37] individually what living the word means
[56:40] in your age so not everyone will speak
[56:43] in tongues not everyone will be a
[56:44] preacher not everyone will run the
[56:46] aisles but that Gene is expressing in
[56:48] your life it's got instructions in it
[56:51] right and you think so well I'll never
[56:52] be able to grow up and be a a husband or
[56:54] a father I'll never be able to live I'll
[56:56] never be able to quit cutting my hair
[56:58] the G the instructions are already in
[57:00] the
[57:01] seat right all you got to do is
[57:03] surrender yourself to the gene it's
[57:05] already there he say it's too hard I'll
[57:07] never be able to do that but it's
[57:09] already in you to do
[57:11] it if you just surrender to
[57:14] it right it's the word and it follows
[57:16] the word so
[57:18] now you when you're born naturally you
[57:21] inherit two pairs of jeans one from your
[57:23] father and one from your mother and I I
[57:26] picked on Joel earlier but I inherited
[57:28] the same set of jeans as Joel he's
[57:31] relatively skinny and I'm
[57:35] fat right and uh
[57:39] but I'm not embarrassed by it I'm just
[57:43] fat but my I look like my dad and he
[57:47] looks more like my mother's side and
[57:50] they they just didn't they weren't as as
[57:52] solid as we are
[57:57] you can go generations back of PRS and
[57:59] they look a little bit like
[58:00] me right and then and then I leaned into
[58:03] that by feeding
[58:06] myself right just pick on myself I
[58:09] leaned into that by feeding feeding
[58:11] myself so that Jean is there and brother
[58:13] Joel's got to watch it or he'll end up
[58:14] leaning into that because he does have
[58:17] that same pair of jeans right you
[58:19] realize you come here you've got human
[58:21] genes right but by your human nature
[58:24] maybe you got a a problem with
[58:26] anger right maybe you got a problem with
[58:28] lust you got a problem with something
[58:30] you know just fly off the top all the
[58:32] time it's a gene it's
[58:34] instructions when something happens
[58:36] maybe alcoholism something it's just
[58:38] written in there it's written into it
[58:41] and you think well I'll never be able to
[58:42] overcome that but remember by the new
[58:44] birth we have a different set of
[58:46] instructions that's
[58:50] right and the same thing that you think
[58:52] well I'll never be able to make it don't
[58:54] you realize that the same power you say
[58:56] well I can't help myself but it'll be
[58:57] the same way as a Christian if you're
[58:59] ever born again of the Holy Spirit you
[59:01] won't be able to help yourself you you
[59:03] don't have to put on something you'll be
[59:05] a Christian you'll live like a Christian
[59:06] you'll walk like a Christian you'll talk
[59:08] like a Christian why because it's on the
[59:10] inside of you expressing out something
[59:13] amen so you don't have to try you don't
[59:16] have to oh you just try to kill yourself
[59:17] so well I'll try to quit smoking I'll TR
[59:19] to quit drinking no just feed on the
[59:21] word let the word become your your whole
[59:23] life let it let lean into that that's
[59:27] right that's good right and I'm sure if
[59:29] I started working out and eat right I'll
[59:32] lose weight even though I have that Gene
[59:35] but what is it what is it there's
[59:36] something becomes dominant in my life
[59:39] now
[59:40] look I express a gene that looks like my
[59:44] father now you the way you look
[59:47] naturally believe it or not was not an
[59:51] accident right you inherited the genes
[59:53] that you did
[59:55] now look look what David says again
[59:57] Psalms
[59:58] 139 they were expressed the way they
[1:00:00] were on purpose he said Thine Eyes did
[1:00:02] see my substance yet being unperfect and
[1:00:05] in myy book all my members were written
[1:00:08] which in continuance were fashioned when
[1:00:10] as yet there was none of them so you
[1:00:13] were made to be expressed a certain way
[1:00:17] in a certain season brother bom tells us
[1:00:19] some things that are to be about John
[1:00:21] 14:2 in my father's house are many
[1:00:22] mansions he says that's many types of
[1:00:25] mansions many kinds of man Mansions he
[1:00:28] said I believe that God is a god of
[1:00:30] variety the world proves that he's got
[1:00:32] big mountains and little mountains he's
[1:00:34] got Plains he's got deserts he's got
[1:00:36] different things because he made it the
[1:00:39] way he wanted
[1:00:42] it so you can't get too discouraged with
[1:00:45] yourself because he made it the way he
[1:00:49] wanted it that's and he made the season
[1:00:51] summer winter spring autumn he made the
[1:00:54] season it shows he's a god of variety he
[1:00:56] made you in a variety now Satan wants
[1:00:59] Conformity that's right right he's
[1:01:01] trying to deform your life into and
[1:01:03] what's funny about it is they think
[1:01:05] they're expressing themselves right and
[1:01:08] you end up with a whole bunch of tattoos
[1:01:09] and a whole bunch of rings and stuff
[1:01:10] like that embedded in their flesh and
[1:01:13] and you wonder why in the world would
[1:01:14] somebody do that well it's to be
[1:01:16] different well there's 400 other ones
[1:01:18] doing it just like
[1:01:20] you right and and no matter how tattooed
[1:01:23] you become there guys out there tattoo
[1:01:25] their
[1:01:27] eyeballs right so you well I'm
[1:01:29] expressing my individuality no God Made
[1:01:32] You individual that's right you don't
[1:01:34] have to change your body you don't have
[1:01:36] to be bulimic and be afraid to eat and
[1:01:39] and and I know some young ladies
[1:01:40] struggle with that you don't have to be
[1:01:41] afraid to eat you don't have to be
[1:01:43] afraid because God made you to have a
[1:01:45] body that wasn't like some model
[1:01:47] somewhere God made you the way you
[1:01:50] are he didn't just make you like
[1:01:52] everybody else he made you Jason now I
[1:01:54] may not look good with red pants on but
[1:01:56] you look good with red pants on he made
[1:01:58] you
[1:02:00] individual are you with me now somebody
[1:02:03] understand he made you as an individual
[1:02:04] when it comes to the message we need to
[1:02:06] we need to approach it as an individual
[1:02:08] thing this is for me I believe that my
[1:02:11] healing is for me others might have
[1:02:13] failed but this is mine this belongs to
[1:02:16] me a thousand may fall by the wayside
[1:02:18] but I believe it's for me I might have
[1:02:21] failed myself before but this is my time
[1:02:23] this is when I grab a hold of the word
[1:02:25] of God this is when I become what God
[1:02:28] wants me to
[1:02:29] be that's
[1:02:31] right so he made you in a
[1:02:34] variety he said he's a god of variety he
[1:02:37] some men are real
[1:02:39] blusterous some are real dogmatic others
[1:02:42] are fine others are kind and if you just
[1:02:46] find all different kinds of people in
[1:02:49] his
[1:02:50] kingdom in his
[1:02:52] kingdom now look
[1:02:55] again the BR said you were all
[1:02:57] pre-planned by
[1:02:58] God nothing happens by chance with God
[1:03:02] he knows all about it it's all
[1:03:03] pre-planned planned for many generations
[1:03:06] back so that you could be here
[1:03:10] tonight he said you at one time was in
[1:03:12] your father in the gene of your father
[1:03:15] now he didn't know you at that time
[1:03:17] neither did you know him at that time
[1:03:19] but you see then he said you were put in
[1:03:21] the beding ground in the womb of mother
[1:03:23] through holy wedlock and then you become
[1:03:25] a person expressed in the image like
[1:03:26] your father he said then there's
[1:03:28] Fellowship he said now the only way that
[1:03:30] you can be a son a daughter of God
[1:03:32] because you have to have eternal life
[1:03:34] and there's only one form of eternal
[1:03:36] life and that's God's life Oh my he said
[1:03:39] there there to be a Son of God you had
[1:03:41] to be in him always someone say always
[1:03:43] always he said the gene of your life
[1:03:45] spiritual life tonight was in God the
[1:03:48] Father before there was even a
[1:03:51] molecule he said and you are nothing but
[1:03:54] the the manifestation of the gene of
[1:03:56] life that was in God as a Son of God
[1:04:00] hallelujah now that ought to kick that
[1:04:02] old suicide devil right in the teeth it
[1:04:05] ought to kick that Old Devil tells you
[1:04:06] you're worthless tells you you don't you
[1:04:08] meant something to God you the fact you
[1:04:11] even heard the message ought to be
[1:04:12] enough to say Lord I'm thankful I'm
[1:04:15] grateful that you brought the message by
[1:04:17] my way I'm grateful that you called me
[1:04:19] out of the world I might have my
[1:04:20] struggles but I come from God and I'm
[1:04:22] going back to God
[1:04:25] I'm grateful he corrects me I'm grateful
[1:04:27] his word skins me sometimes because I
[1:04:30] know that I'm going back to God I'm
[1:04:32] becoming what he wants me to
[1:04:34] be amen and so he said you're a
[1:04:37] manifestation of the gene of life that
[1:04:39] was in God he said now you're expressed
[1:04:41] after his word has come into you to
[1:04:43] light up this age amen that's what we
[1:04:45] ought to be doing today lighting up the
[1:04:47] age not to be hidden away somewhere and
[1:04:50] and little just just staying away and
[1:04:52] not let the world see your light no he
[1:04:54] said you don't hide a Candlestick under
[1:04:56] a bushel but you take the bushel off of
[1:04:58] it let the world see what you are God's
[1:05:02] life in you amen you you have come now
[1:05:04] you expressed the light up to say you
[1:05:06] are the expressing God's life in you
[1:05:08] because you're a son or daughter of God
[1:05:10] you are now made I love the way that's
[1:05:13] intentional that's intentional he made
[1:05:15] you yes sir you're not an
[1:05:19] accidental
[1:05:21] oversight but you're made you're setting
[1:05:25] in this church tonight because your duty
[1:05:27] is to express God to this nation and
[1:05:29] this people and this neighborhood where
[1:05:30] you associate so everywhere you go you
[1:05:33] think God there has to be a reason I'm
[1:05:35] here right right there's a reason I'm
[1:05:38] here sir you may find yourself flat on
[1:05:40] your back in a hospital bed but there's
[1:05:41] a reason I'm
[1:05:43] here right and then that that changes
[1:05:45] your whole perspective of things I I
[1:05:48] couldn't do I couldn't be the light that
[1:05:49] I am anywhere else we talked about Jonah
[1:05:52] how God brother br said he uses his
[1:05:55] permissive will to magnify his perfect
[1:05:57] will so I find myself flat on my back I
[1:06:00] I've told you the story before I think
[1:06:02] but I remember uh being in a hospital
[1:06:04] for one of the few times in my life I've
[1:06:05] been in the hospital I was in the
[1:06:06] hospital for almost a week and and and
[1:06:08] I'm sitting there feeling sorry for
[1:06:09] myself thinking you know and my pastor
[1:06:12] at that time was gone and he's out of
[1:06:13] town and and wasn't very many people
[1:06:15] coming to visit me and I was kind of
[1:06:16] feeling sorry for myself and laying
[1:06:18] there in the hospital Brother David you
[1:06:20] know what that's like and laying there
[1:06:22] in the hospital my my wife was driving
[1:06:23] back back and forth and one night she
[1:06:26] leaves she's in my truck which is a
[1:06:28] newer truck it was it was fine and I
[1:06:30] didn't worry about it but the alternator
[1:06:32] went out and uh her cell phone was dead
[1:06:36] and so she's on the side of the road
[1:06:37] between Jonesboro and Brooklyn just on
[1:06:39] the side of the road in the dark with
[1:06:41] three little babies and three little
[1:06:43] kids and and she's sitting there
[1:06:45] wondering what am I going to do so she
[1:06:46] gets out and starts walking and there's
[1:06:48] a there's a gas station as far enough
[1:06:50] the way she can see it but it's a ways
[1:06:52] down there and she's going down towards
[1:06:54] Brooklyn and somebody stops and it's
[1:06:57] it's a lady that her husband is a
[1:06:58] missionary in in Jonesboro and and
[1:07:01] they're friends to this day actually and
[1:07:02] she got a chance to witness to that
[1:07:04] person and I begin to think in that
[1:07:06] hospital room I begin to think Lord did
[1:07:08] you put me here just so that my wife
[1:07:11] would have to do that so that she could
[1:07:13] meet that person so she could be a
[1:07:14] friend to that person cuz maybe that
[1:07:16] person was somebody who who would be
[1:07:19] good to the bride who would give my wife
[1:07:20] a ride on the way so she could be saved
[1:07:22] you think would God do that absolutely
[1:07:24] God would do that would he care enough
[1:07:27] about my life to do that absolutely he
[1:07:29] would you say well I'm struggling with
[1:07:31] my job right now I'm strugg I wonder if
[1:07:33] you wouldn't look at it like this Lord
[1:07:35] you put me in my situation to be a light
[1:07:37] to my neighborhood be a light in the job
[1:07:39] where a man let me be that light Lord
[1:07:41] let me show them how a Christian handles
[1:07:43] a difficult circumstance let me show
[1:07:46] them that a Christian don't quit when
[1:07:47] things get rough let me show them that a
[1:07:49] Christian goes to church and lives loves
[1:07:52] God and lives for God and does the
[1:07:54] things they're supposed to do even when
[1:07:55] it's hard sir let me be a
[1:07:58] light
[1:08:00] hallelujah
[1:08:02] amen so wherever you are God knew that
[1:08:04] you would be
[1:08:05] here because you have to be one of his
[1:08:08] jeans or his attributes he said you had
[1:08:11] to be if you ever if you've got eternal
[1:08:14] life then it always was eternal life
[1:08:16] right oh my and God before there was a
[1:08:19] foundation World knew that you would be
[1:08:21] here sir he said when the word the water
[1:08:23] the washing of the the word fell upon
[1:08:24] you it was expressed in a being he said
[1:08:27] now you have fellowship with your father
[1:08:29] God just as you have with your Earthly
[1:08:30] father you're citizens of the king not
[1:08:32] citizens but your children Sons and
[1:08:34] Daughters of the Living God if it be
[1:08:36] that the eternal life dwells in you he
[1:08:38] said now then if it was Jesus was the
[1:08:40] fullness of godhead man of God
[1:08:41] manifested he was the fullness of the
[1:08:43] godhead bodily therefore when you came
[1:08:45] to the Earth was manifested in flesh you
[1:08:47] were in him then because he was the word
[1:08:49] so he tells us you were with him in
[1:08:51] death with him in burial with him in
[1:08:52] Resurrection right you were in him on
[1:08:55] the
[1:08:56] cross right he said now if we are those
[1:08:58] attributes of God we cannot live by
[1:09:00] Creeds we cannot live by
[1:09:02] denominationalism we must live by the
[1:09:04] word we must live by the word because
[1:09:06] the Bride is a part of the bridegroom
[1:09:08] like any wife is a part of her husband
[1:09:10] therefore we must be that word bride and
[1:09:13] let me say this we must live the word
[1:09:17] yes go back and listen to the Token
[1:09:19] brother brand tells us it's not enough
[1:09:20] to say I believe it it's not enough to
[1:09:23] listen to it right but you've got to
[1:09:25] live it you've got to become that word
[1:09:28] and what we're doing as a church is
[1:09:30] we're we're trying to live it we're not
[1:09:33] trying just to hear it because we must
[1:09:35] hear it but we must also live
[1:09:37] it that's why we we do what we do
[1:09:40] because we must live the word he said we
[1:09:42] must live by the word because a bride is
[1:09:43] part of the bridegroom like any wife is
[1:09:45] part of her husband we must be that word
[1:09:47] bride what is that word bride the
[1:09:48] manifestation of this hour the
[1:09:50] manifestation of this hour the bride not
[1:09:52] a Creed or denomination but living
[1:09:54] Oracle of God a living attribute of God
[1:09:56] displaying to the world the attributes
[1:09:58] of God in the formation of the Bride
[1:10:00] that's to be expressed in this hour that
[1:10:01] we're now living He said Martin Luther
[1:10:03] could not express the attributes that we
[1:10:05] express because that was in the
[1:10:06] beginning the resurrection like the corn
[1:10:08] of wheat went to the Earth are you still
[1:10:09] with me this morning just a few more
[1:10:11] minutes we'll close he said he talked
[1:10:14] about a man who didn't understand the
[1:10:15] Dark Ages because he had no
[1:10:18] Revelation right and this is important
[1:10:21] because many times we don't understand
[1:10:22] what's going on because we we lack
[1:10:24] Revelation you need to know what what's
[1:10:27] for your hour amen what's going on in
[1:10:29] your hour what we're supposed to be
[1:10:30] doing in the hour you live him amen they
[1:10:33] didn't understand the Dark Ages because
[1:10:34] of no Revelation How could a merciful
[1:10:37] god do that right he said he didn't
[1:10:40] understand he said he didn't have the re
[1:10:42] he said the revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:10:44] in this hour not what he was in another
[1:10:46] hour what he was now the Bible expresses
[1:10:49] this growing in the bride to the full
[1:10:52] stature he said the therefore if the
[1:10:54] corn of wheat of Christ had to fall in
[1:10:55] the ground so did the bride have to fall
[1:10:57] in the ground through the Dark Ages any
[1:10:59] grain that goes in the ground must die
[1:11:01] or it cannot reproduce itself and the
[1:11:03] great church that he established on the
[1:11:04] day of Pentecost by the sending of the
[1:11:06] Holy Ghost had to suffer marom martyrdom
[1:11:08] and go into the dirt into the dark into
[1:11:10] the Earth in the Dark Age to bring forth
[1:11:12] again the age of Luther and come on out
[1:11:14] to the full stature of the Bride of
[1:11:15] Jesus Christ for this last day therefore
[1:11:18] the bride in the Rapture will someone
[1:11:20] say will are you worried about missing
[1:11:22] the Rapture you say if I don't do this
[1:11:24] if I don't do that don't that's
[1:11:25] Catholicism if you are pre-planned by
[1:11:27] God you will go in the
[1:11:32] Rapture know how many eyes you you dot
[1:11:34] how many tees you cross you will go in
[1:11:36] the Rapture because you belong to God
[1:11:41] sir you won't go in cuz I said so right
[1:11:44] there' be a lot of surprises I'll be
[1:11:45] surprised by some people who make it
[1:11:48] mostly by
[1:11:51] myself right all of us will be I'm just
[1:11:55] just be honest you'll be a little bit
[1:11:56] surprised that you made
[1:11:59] it cuz you know you better than anybody
[1:12:02] but I'm so glad for his grace and
[1:12:04] brother BR said if you find me he said
[1:12:06] when when you find me he said I'll be
[1:12:08] one over there by the by the trees that
[1:12:09] sing an Amazing Grace how sweet to sound
[1:12:12] that saved a Wretch like Me it took his
[1:12:14] grace to make me what I am it'll take
[1:12:16] his grace to make me what I will
[1:12:20] be the brand said therefore the bride
[1:12:22] and the Rapture will come forth there
[1:12:24] was all pre-planned by God all backed up
[1:12:26] he said from the beginning he knew every
[1:12:28] man every place who would set all about
[1:12:30] it it's all pre-plan God knew it would
[1:12:33] be here you can back look back over your
[1:12:36] life and you can see by faith you can
[1:12:38] see oh this happened in my life and I
[1:12:39] thought it was a terrible thing but then
[1:12:41] I look and see what God did out of that
[1:12:43] and out of the ashes of my the burning
[1:12:46] down of what I thought my idea of life
[1:12:48] was he created something
[1:12:51] else oh God and I don't Oh my he created
[1:12:54] something better he never does something
[1:12:56] worse he always does something better I
[1:12:58] thought this was it I thought this
[1:13:00] preacher this this pastor or this church
[1:13:02] or or this was it but no God was all all
[1:13:04] the time working doing something you
[1:13:06] didn't even expect bringing something
[1:13:07] you didn't even foresee but it's here
[1:13:09] today and you look at it and think God I
[1:13:11] know you were working that gives me
[1:13:13] confidence for the future you might be
[1:13:15] doing something now that I can't see but
[1:13:17] you're doing it
[1:13:18] anyway you're working in my life
[1:13:22] Hallelujah that's true yes sir
[1:13:25] amen now look I'm just being honest with
[1:13:28] you naturally if you have a gene with
[1:13:30] the
[1:13:31] instructions that passed on to you from
[1:13:33] your father to like alcohol you're more
[1:13:35] likely to like
[1:13:37] alcohol if you have a gene that causes
[1:13:40] depression anxiety you're more likely to
[1:13:42] do that because that's in your
[1:13:44] genes you realize that all of us express
[1:13:47] those at one point in our
[1:13:48] life and we just made a good job of it
[1:13:52] all of us did
[1:13:54] 1 Corinthians 6:9 know you not the
[1:13:55] unrighteous shall not inherit the
[1:13:57] kingdom of God he said be not deceived
[1:13:59] neither fornicators nor idolators nor
[1:14:01] adulterers they're just expressing what
[1:14:03] they are sinners or effeminate
[1:14:07] homosexuality abusers of themselves with
[1:14:10] mankind thieves Covetous drunkards
[1:14:13] revilers extortioners shall inherit the
[1:14:16] kingdom of God I that's going to inherit
[1:14:18] the kingdom of God but I love this
[1:14:21] scripture and such were some of you
[1:14:25] [Music]
[1:14:26] amen amen such were some of you maybe
[1:14:30] you were in a dead cold formal church
[1:14:32] maybe you were in a denomination maybe
[1:14:33] you were maybe you were a person who
[1:14:34] didn't go to church at all maybe you did
[1:14:36] everything bad you could do such were
[1:14:38] some of you but thank you Lord
[1:14:41] hallelujah I'm so glad for the message
[1:14:43] of the hour that washed me I'm so glad
[1:14:45] for the spirit of God that washes me
[1:14:47] today but you are washed but you are
[1:14:49] Sanctified but you are justified by the
[1:14:51] name of the Lord Jesus by the spirit of
[1:14:54] our God hallelujah but you are washed oh
[1:14:58] I'm so grateful for that today sister
[1:15:00] Stephanie you know what I'm talking
[1:15:01] about you expressed that in your life
[1:15:03] but now you're expressing something else
[1:15:05] some of the rest of you you know maybe
[1:15:06] it's been years ago maybe you need to go
[1:15:08] back and think about it again brother JT
[1:15:10] one day you express the genes of an
[1:15:12] alcoholic but today youve sit in church
[1:15:14] for decades and believe the word of God
[1:15:16] why because there's something inside of
[1:15:17] you that there there was another Gene
[1:15:20] another set of instructions that told
[1:15:22] you to do something
[1:15:27] such were some of you but you're
[1:15:29] washed we can't look down on nobody
[1:15:32] that's
[1:15:34] right but you're
[1:15:40] washed see there's a g Gene that
[1:15:43] dominates your life that's why two
[1:15:45] siblings one has a dominant gene that
[1:15:48] expresses a certain color of hair and
[1:15:49] the other one has a dominant gene
[1:15:51] expresses the other color of hair see
[1:15:53] the seed life in in us has to be the
[1:15:55] dominant gene that's what the baptism of
[1:15:57] the Holy Ghost does it causes that Gene
[1:15:59] seed to dominate your life produce the
[1:16:02] fruit of the spirit Nicodemus came to
[1:16:05] Jesus by night I don't have time to read
[1:16:06] all of this but if you go to John
[1:16:08] chapter
[1:16:09] three Jesus tells him in verse five
[1:16:13] Jesus verily I say to the except a man
[1:16:14] be born of water and the spirit you
[1:16:16] cannot enter into the kingdom of God
[1:16:18] that which is born of the flesh is
[1:16:21] flesh and that which is born of the
[1:16:24] spirit is spirit amen what's Born Again
[1:16:28] The Soul that's right and the Soul has
[1:16:30] to dominate the spirit the soul has to
[1:16:32] dominate The Flesh right Matthew 1:18
[1:16:36] listen Mary when the birth of Jesus
[1:16:39] Christ was on this wise when as his M
[1:16:41] mother Mary was espoused to Joseph
[1:16:43] before they came together she was found
[1:16:45] with child of what of the Holy Ghost
[1:16:48] thank you Lord and the conception
[1:16:49] brother B taught us was without
[1:16:50] sensation he say the mystery of the
[1:16:52] baptism the Holy Ghost without sensation
[1:16:55] but the person of Christ performing in
[1:16:58] you the same works that he did thank you
[1:17:01] hallelujah hallelujah so it's it's the
[1:17:03] baptism of the Holy Ghost that produces
[1:17:04] a life so the spirit of God begins to
[1:17:07] move over you and it takes the spirit of
[1:17:10] God to bring that to life how many
[1:17:11] believe that today he's building you as
[1:17:14] an individual by putting you in the
[1:17:15] right atmosphere for a birth he puts you
[1:17:18] under the right warant puts you in a
[1:17:19] church or put you in a family or put you
[1:17:21] somewhere where you can be born
[1:17:23] that's right put you in the right
[1:17:24] atmosphere to be bored oh I'm so
[1:17:26] grateful for that today today he said
[1:17:28] now no matter what stage you're in
[1:17:30] there's nothing that will keep you from
[1:17:31] becoming a reflection of him brother B
[1:17:32] said there's nothing that can keep me
[1:17:34] from rising in the do you believe that
[1:17:37] today in the resurrection there's
[1:17:39] nothing that can keep me from rising
[1:17:41] there ain't enough devils in all hell
[1:17:42] can keep me from rising there ain't
[1:17:44] nothing nowhere to keep me from rising
[1:17:46] he said I have the promise of God he
[1:17:48] said I have the Holy Spirit I got Zoe
[1:17:51] God's eternal life resting in here this
[1:17:53] old carcass come from there and God
[1:17:55] brooded me out of the ground that's
[1:17:57] right he talked about how we had no
[1:17:59] choice in our natural birth right and he
[1:18:01] talks like this after telling his life
[1:18:02] story he said if he made me what I am
[1:18:05] without a choice come on now right you
[1:18:07] didn't have a choice in being born in
[1:18:08] the family you were born in you didn't
[1:18:10] have a choice in any of that he said if
[1:18:11] you made you what you were without a
[1:18:13] choice how much more when that Holy
[1:18:14] Ghost goes to brooding over me and I say
[1:18:17] yay Lord You're My Creator I love you
[1:18:19] and I accept you as my savior how you
[1:18:21] going to hold me in the dust amen just
[1:18:23] can't do it
[1:18:27] brother listen what brother BR says he
[1:18:29] said God never formed one piece of this
[1:18:31] Calum or potash or anything else that'll
[1:18:32] ever be wasted that's
[1:18:35] right hlj what a powerful
[1:18:38] thought just go chew on that for a
[1:18:43] while amen quotes John 6:39 he said this
[1:18:47] is the Father's will which you sent me
[1:18:48] all of of all which you have given me I
[1:18:50] should lose nothing but should raise it
[1:18:53] up again at the last day I heard him
[1:18:55] call he said when I come to him how can
[1:18:57] they keep me in the dust of the earth

[1:19:01] world to Pat me in the face with a
[1:19:03] shovel whatever keep me in the dust of
[1:19:05] the earth I shall rise someday and stand
[1:19:08] in his likeness washed in his blood
