[48:26] You believe he's a mighty God today?
[48:29] Amen. Isn't it good to be in the house
[48:31] of the Lord on a Sunday morning? Amen.
[48:34] To continue to worship God and and to
[48:37] just give him all the glory and the
[48:38] honor. Uh we want to do that today. It's
[48:41] good to have each and every one of you
[48:43] with us. I want to uh thank you for
[48:46] coming and and you supported the
[48:48] meetings. I appreciate that. And some of
[48:50] the folks that come from brother Eric
[48:52] Reeks, we appreciate you coming this
[48:54] morning and um and being here all
[48:57] weekend and drove down and I pray God
[48:59] would give you a special blessing for
[49:00] that. And and then uh those of you that
[49:03] come from Texas, Brother Joshua, and
[49:05] coming through traveling through to Ohio
[49:07] and and we appreciate you coming, buddy.
[49:09] And you're welcome back at any time. and
[49:12] and then I see um uh brother Tom Herring
[49:15] and Sister Nancy with us and their son
[49:17] with us this morning. Good to have you
[49:19] all back. You're y'all are home, folks.
[49:21] So, y'all just make yourself welcome.
[49:23] We've kind of changed the sanctuary
[49:24] since they've been here. So, they didn't
[49:26] know where to sit down when they come
[49:28] in, but but uh we appreciate them coming
[49:31] and and give Brother Tim and the folks
[49:33] there at at the church our greetings.
[49:36] And uh thank God for the bride all
[49:38] around the world.
[49:40] I was so thankful for all the people
[49:42] that supported our meetings from all of
[49:44] the different local churches. I was so
[49:46] happy to see that and just a few from
[49:49] every church it seemed like and I
[49:50] appreciated that very much and uh kind
[49:53] of a different crowd every night but we
[49:55] appreciated that. And um there's some
[49:57] meetings coming up I wanted to tell you
[49:59] about and on Memorial Day there's three
[50:01] different meetings going on to the east
[50:03] of us. Brother Ivy is having meetings
[50:06] that weekend and I'll probably be over
[50:08] there. I think brother McGary is going
[50:10] to be there, brother David McGary. And
[50:12] um so I'll probably go fellowship with
[50:14] them some over the weekend. And um and
[50:17] then brother David Silers, I think
[50:18] brother Donnie Reagan is coming in over
[50:20] there if I'm not mistaken on Memorial
[50:22] Day weekend and going to be at brother
[50:24] David Silers, brother Joseph Hammond is
[50:26] having a youth meeting I believe that
[50:28] same weekend. So if you get a chance to
[50:32] want to travel on Memorial Day weekend,
[50:33] that'd be fine to go fellowship with
[50:36] them. We don't want just people to come
[50:37] here. We want to go fellowship with them
[50:39] as well and bless them. So we appreciate
[50:43] all of our sister churches in the area.
[50:45] Uh everybody striving to promote the
[50:48] message of the hour. Amen. and what we
[50:51] believe is the end time truth because
[50:52] we're going home
[50:54] and we got to, as I said the other
[50:56] night, we got to learn how to sit around
[50:58] a table and get along. We can't get
[51:00] along here. What are we going to do when
[51:02] we get there? Be kind of awkward. We
[51:04] don't want heaven to be awkward, do you?
[51:06] Amen. Amen. So, we appreciate your
[51:09] fellowship this morning. I want to say
[51:11] thanks to the sisters who work so hard
[51:13] on on the food and different ones and
[51:16] that helped. And I won't start calling
[51:17] names because I'll leave you out. But I
[51:19] do want to thank my wife for putting up
[51:21] with me doing this and especially being
[51:23] her birthday, our anniversary coming up,
[51:25] both of my kids' birthdays and and
[51:27] everybody that's helped out. And um
[51:29] Brother Joe, we don't mention him, but
[51:31] he cleans the church now and then and we
[51:34] appreciate him doing that and and uh and
[51:37] coming and and sweeping up after
[51:39] everybody's gone and different things
[51:40] like that. And it means a lot. And your
[51:42] service to the Lord means a lot. I
[51:44] appreciate our deacons being being here
[51:46] and and helping us in the meeting and
[51:48] and you don't know what that means to be
[51:50] here and the Savage family coming and
[51:53] supporting the meetings with what went
[51:55] on this week with brother Harvey passing
[51:57] away, but we believe that uh you know
[51:59] that's what he would want and that's
[52:00] what brother Harvey said. So, we
[52:02] appreciate that. You don't know what
[52:04] that means to me as a pastor to see you
[52:06] doing that and uh being at your post of
[52:09] duty, it means something. You're you're
[52:11] a part of the wheel. If you've ever
[52:13] tried to ride a bike with the spokes
[52:15] out, you know what it's like to have to
[52:18] have a spoke not there. You're a part
[52:20] when you're not here. We miss you. And
[52:22] so we thank you for being here this
[52:25] morning. I especially want to thank
[52:27] brother Andrew, Sister Mariah for coming
[52:29] and being with us this morning and and
[52:31] this whole weekend. Hasn't it been
[52:32] wonderful? And the word of God been
[52:34] wonderful.
[52:39] My It just feels like we could leave
[52:40] this place and just go home. Amen.
[52:43] Amen. But we got more this morning.
[52:45] We got another helping, another part of
[52:47] the feast. It's a seven course meal.
[52:50] We're going to get part of that this
[52:51] morning. And so, as brother Andrew
[52:53] comes, I want to uh this young man has
[52:55] dedicated his life to the Lord. And I
[52:57] just I I want to thank him for that. And
[52:59] uh I know what it's like to be a young
[53:01] preacher and the kind of criticism that
[53:02] you get and and and being out there and
[53:05] and and just preaching it straight and
[53:07] and preaching like a man advanced in
[53:09] years, but he's not. And but I just
[53:11] appreciate that and like I said, I I I
[53:14] empathize with that, I guess, a little
[53:16] bit. And and I want to say thank you to
[53:18] him. And God, may God bless his
[53:20] ministry. As he comes, could we sing
[53:22] thanks? Thanks. I give you thanks. Most
[53:24] of all, we want to thank him for being
[53:26] here. Amen. Let's do that. As brother
[53:28] Andrew comes, I want to say thanks.
[53:32] Thanks.
[53:34] I give you thanks
[53:37] for all
[53:39] you've
[53:41] done.
[53:43] Oh, I am so blessed.
[53:47] My soul has found rest. Oh Lord,
[53:53] I give you thanks. No more time. I want
[53:57] to say thanks.
[54:01] Oh, I give you thanks.
[54:04] for all
[54:07] you've done.
[54:11] Oh, I am so blessed. Oh, my soul has
[54:16] found rest. Oh Lord,
[54:21] I give you thanks. Aren't you glad you
[54:24] can thank him today? Amen. I forgot
[54:27] somebody. I forgot to thank our
[54:29] musicians. Amen. Give them a hand this
[54:32] morning. Amen. They've done a wonderful
[54:34] job and we appreciate our musicians here
[54:36] at Word of Life Tabernacle. God bless
[54:39] you. Thank you for being at your post of
[54:40] duty. Amen. Let's sing it once again as
[54:42] brother Andrew comes. Amen. Oh, I want
[54:46] to say thanks. Oh, thanks. Hallelujah.
[54:53] [Music]
[55:02] [Applause]
[55:03] [Music]
[55:07] Oh,
[55:09] I give you thanks one more time.
[55:13] [Music]
[55:18] I give you thanks
[55:21] for all
[55:23] you
[55:24] done.
[55:27] [Music]
[55:28] I am so blessed.
[55:32] So,
[55:34] oh Lord,
[55:37] I give you thanks.
[55:41] You can give him thanks this morning.
[55:44] Hallelujah.
[55:45] Blessed be the name of the Lord. Amen.
[55:47] He
[55:48] He is worthy to be praised. Amen.
[55:51] believe the Bible said from the rising
[55:52] of the sun
[55:53] to the going down of the same, he is
[55:55] worthy to be praised. And isn't he a
[55:57] mighty God this morning,
[55:59] Amen. And we sure love him and we thank
[56:01] him for his mercy and his grace. And we
[56:03] want to say God bless you once again
[56:05] this morning. We sure count it an honor,
[56:07] privilege to be with you all. And I pray
[56:09] that uh something has been said to be a
[56:11] blessing to you and a help to you this
[56:13] weekend and to encourage the church
[56:14] here. and want to say we appreciate all
[56:16] the labors of the assembly here for the
[56:18] meetings and the cooking and uh the
[56:20] fellowship and everything that's been
[56:22] done. We we just want to say we
[56:23] appreciate it and appreciate brother
[56:25] Ben. Appreciate his friendship, the
[56:27] church here and all of our friends here
[56:29] this morning. We we just uh thank the
[56:31] Lord for the privilege he's given us to
[56:33] serve him. Amen. We know that it ain't
[56:35] going to be much longer and we're all
[56:36] going to be gathered back home where we
[56:38] came from. There won't be no more, you
[56:40] know, 500, 600,000 miles between us.
[56:43] Amen. but we'll all be together. Amen.
[56:45] And we sure are looking forward to that.
[56:47] And if you have your Bibles this
[56:49] morning, we want to look in the book of
[56:50] Micah, the fifth chapter. And while
[56:53] you're turning there, we want to say
[56:55] that we pray the Lord would just
[56:57] continue to bless the assembly here. May
[57:00] you just continue to grow in the word
[57:01] and the Lord. And amen, may his his
[57:04] blessing rest upon you. And I appreciate
[57:06] you all for your stand for this message.
[57:09] And Amen. I believe it's the power of
[57:11] God and the salvation. Don't you? Amen.
[57:13] In the book of Micah, the fifth chapter
[57:16] and in the second verse, uh before we
[57:19] before we read, can we just bow our
[57:20] hearts together for a word of prayer?
[57:23] Let's just ask him to come and how many
[57:25] will agree the word is anointed this
[57:27] morning, let's just ask him to anoint
[57:29] our faith in his anointed word. Heavenly
[57:31] Father, Lord, as your believers have
[57:33] gathered here this afternoon, Lord, on
[57:35] this Sunday morning, this resurrection
[57:38] day, Father, as a young man, Lord, just
[57:41] a little boy, Father, there's always
[57:43] been something in my heart about a
[57:45] Sunday morning and to wake up, the sun
[57:47] to be shining, the birds to be singing,
[57:50] Lord, and to be able to make our way to
[57:52] the house of God. That that is
[57:54] something, Lord, I don't ever want to
[57:55] take lightly. But Lord, I want to take
[57:57] advantage of every opportunity that you
[57:59] give us to be in your presence and to be
[58:01] in your house. And this morning, Lord,
[58:03] as we come, Lord, as we want to just
[58:05] thank you for moving among us, Lord, in
[58:07] these meetings in such a special way,
[58:10] Lord, how your presence has just come
[58:11] and wave after wave. And Lord, surge
[58:14] after surge of your glory. We felt you
[58:16] among us.
[58:17] Thank you, Lord.
[58:18] Lord, I believe lives have been changed.
[58:20] I believe hearts have been touched. Now,
[58:23] Father, as we endeavor to look into your
[58:24] word this morning, I'm asking you to
[58:27] send the spirit of grace into this
[58:28] meeting, may you drive back every spirit
[58:31] of tiredness, every spirit of coldness,
[58:33] Father, Lord, every enemy that will try
[58:36] to hinder this meeting in any way.
[58:37] Father, I pray you would bind the hand
[58:39] of the enemy. Lord, may you give us a
[58:41] liberty in your word this morning.
[58:43] Father, you see these thoughts that are
[58:45] upon my heart, Lord, being Lord, led
[58:47] into this direction, Lord, just just by
[58:49] your spirit moving us in this way. I
[58:52] pray Lord that some way, somehow
[58:54] something could be said to strengthen
[58:55] this church, to strengthen your people.
[58:57] Lord, may you anoint us aresh this
[58:59] morning, God, and we'll be sure to give
[59:01] you all the praise, all the honor, and
[59:04] all the glory for it's in the wonderful
[59:05] name of our Lord and Savior Jesus
[59:08] Christ. We do pray and all the believers
[59:10] said,
[59:11] "Amen."
[59:12] Amen. And amen. the book of Micah the
[59:14] fifth chapter and in the second verse
[59:18] the Bible here says but thou Bethlehem
[59:21] Ephraa though thou be little among the
[59:24] thousands of Judah yet out of thee shall
[59:28] he come forth unto me that is to be
[59:30] ruler in Israel whose goings forth have
[59:34] been from of old from everlasting
[59:39] I love this here but thou Bethlehem
[59:42] Ephraa Uh, I love what what the spirit
[59:44] of prophecy through the prophet Micah
[59:46] says, "Though thou be little among the
[59:49] thousands of Judah, but yet out of thee
[59:53] shall he come forth." Now, think about
[59:55] that. Though thou be the least or the
[59:57] smallest of the thousands of Israel, of
[1:00:00] Judah, yet out of thee shall come
[1:00:03] something great. Now, in the book of
[1:00:04] Matthew, the 2 chapter,
[1:00:07] those of you that study the messianic
[1:00:09] prophecies, you know that Matthew 2 is
[1:00:12] the fulfillment of Micah 5. In Matthew
[1:00:16] the 2 chapter in the first verse, the
[1:00:19] Bible here says, "Now when Jesus was
[1:00:23] born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days
[1:00:25] of Herod the king, behold, there came
[1:00:28] wise men from the east to Jerusalem,
[1:00:31] saying, Where is he that is born king of
[1:00:34] the Jews? For we have seen his star in
[1:00:37] the east, and are come to worship him."
[1:00:41] When Herod the king had heard these
[1:00:42] things, he was troubled and all
[1:00:44] Jerusalem with him. And when he had
[1:00:47] gathered all the chief priests and
[1:00:48] scribes of the people together, he
[1:00:50] demanded of them where Christ should be
[1:00:52] born. And they said unto him, "In
[1:00:55] Bethlehem of Judea," notice here, what
[1:00:58] do they go back to what the prophet
[1:01:00] said, "For thus it is written by the
[1:01:03] prophet, and thou Bethlehem in the land
[1:01:05] of Judea, are not the least among the
[1:01:07] princes of Judah. For out of thee shall
[1:01:10] come a governor. Let's say that
[1:01:11] together. For out of thee shall come a
[1:01:14] governor that shall rule my people
[1:01:16] Israel. And then when Herod, when he had
[1:01:18] privately called the wise men, inquired
[1:01:19] of them diligently, what time did the
[1:01:22] star appear? And he sent them to
[1:01:24] Bethlehem and said, "Go and search
[1:01:26] diligently for the young child. And when
[1:01:28] ye have found him, bring me word again
[1:01:31] that I may come and worship him also."
[1:01:34] So how many wants to worship the
[1:01:36] resurrected Lord Jesus Christ this
[1:01:38] morning that I amen may worship him
[1:01:40] also. And when they had heard the king
[1:01:43] they departed and lo the star which they
[1:01:46] saw in the east went before them notice
[1:01:49] till it came and stood over where the
[1:01:51] young child was. And I love this. And
[1:01:54] when they saw amen the star they
[1:01:57] rejoiced
[1:01:58] with exceeding great joy. when when they
[1:02:00] saw the star, they rejoiced with
[1:02:03] exceeding great joy. We ask the Lord
[1:02:05] this morning to add the blessing to the
[1:02:07] reading of his word. As you may have
[1:02:09] your seats here this morning, amen, from
[1:02:11] those scriptures, if I if I could speak
[1:02:13] to you this morning, maybe just to share
[1:02:15] some things from my heart, I'd like to
[1:02:17] speak to you on the mystery of
[1:02:19] Bethlehem. The mystery of Bethlehem.
[1:02:22] Now, you you that that title may uh
[1:02:24] throw you there for just a moment, but
[1:02:26] give us some grace. Amen. And maybe just
[1:02:28] to lay a foundation here in the
[1:02:30] direction we want to go this morning,
[1:02:32] the prophet actually preaches a message
[1:02:34] called Amen. Why little Bethlehem? And
[1:02:37] in that message in the in the paragraph
[1:02:39] 81, he says, "But all the time in there,
[1:02:43] do you notice there's working a great
[1:02:45] mighty mystery that no one seemed to
[1:02:48] understand?" He said, "That's the same
[1:02:51] thing it is today." Amen. In God's
[1:02:54] Bethlehem today. Think about that.
[1:02:56] That's the same thing it is today in
[1:02:59] God's Bethlehem today. He said there's
[1:03:02] working a mystery sign that no one seems
[1:03:05] to understand it. It's something that
[1:03:07] goes over the top of the heads of the
[1:03:09] people. They don't seem to get it. No
[1:03:12] matter what's done or what's said, he
[1:03:14] said, "And the mysterious part of the
[1:03:16] things it's done, the people will say,
[1:03:19] "Oh, well, I guess it's all right." And
[1:03:20] they'll go right on, but they don't
[1:03:22] understand it. He said, "They can't
[1:03:24] catch it. They can't grasp it." He said,
[1:03:26] "That's what God was doing in Bethlehem
[1:03:29] in Judea." Amen. That's what God who was
[1:03:32] doing this. God was doing this in
[1:03:34] Bethlehem in Judea. He was working all
[1:03:37] these little things. Amen. Moving up to
[1:03:40] come to one great head. Now, now I I
[1:03:43] want you to catch something here because
[1:03:45] Amen. Amen. One of my favorite tapes has
[1:03:47] been Amen. Why little Bethlehem? And
[1:03:50] I've listened to that tape probably a
[1:03:51] hundred times over and over and over and
[1:03:53] over and over. Amen. But just the other
[1:03:55] day, amen, I really finally caught why
[1:03:57] the prophet of God was preaching that
[1:03:59] message in that quote right there. He
[1:04:01] said, "In God's Bethlehem today." So,
[1:04:04] amen, right there, we find there was a
[1:04:05] Bethlehem of a thousands of years ago.
[1:04:08] Amen. But then, there is a Bethlehem of
[1:04:10] today where there is a Bethlehem now.
[1:04:13] Now, amen. I'll say it like this. It
[1:04:14] wasn't a man's doing then. Amen. In the
[1:04:17] Bethlehem then. And it's not a man's
[1:04:19] doing today. in the best of I am today.
[1:04:22] It has always and always will be the
[1:04:25] doing of the almighty God. The prophet
[1:04:27] will say in return in Jubilee, you see
[1:04:29] what a man can do and then you see what
[1:04:31] God does. Think about this. What man
[1:04:33] does, Amen, is failing and it will fail
[1:04:36] and it has failed and it will always
[1:04:39] fail. See, brother Brandham left man no
[1:04:41] room, amen, to succeed. Amen. But but
[1:04:43] what God does is eternal and must
[1:04:46] forever remain. See, nothing can ever
[1:04:49] take it away. Amen. God give it. It's
[1:04:52] his free gift. And by a sovereign
[1:04:54] foresight. Amen. He saw it and he placed
[1:04:57] it. And there's nothing can ever move
[1:04:59] it. It is there eternally. Amen. So what
[1:05:02] a man does has failed. Amen. It will
[1:05:05] fail. It has always failed. It will
[1:05:07] continue to fail. Amen. But what God
[1:05:09] does is eternal. Amen. than to think
[1:05:12] this morning that God was doing
[1:05:14] something, amen, eternally out of a
[1:05:16] little city called Bethlehem.
[1:05:20] Now, the prophet said God was working,
[1:05:22] amen, a mystery out of Bethlehem. Now,
[1:05:25] you say, "But Andrew, what is a
[1:05:26] mystery?" Well, the Bible says in
[1:05:28] Matthew 13:1, "Amen, because it is given
[1:05:31] unto you, which the prophet says, that
[1:05:33] is his disciples." Amen. To know the
[1:05:36] mystery. Somebody say mysteries. Amen.
[1:05:39] the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven.
[1:05:41] Amen. But to them it is not given. Now
[1:05:44] watch what a mystery is. It is a
[1:05:46] scripture. It is a previously hidden
[1:05:48] truth. Amen. Now divinely revealed but
[1:05:52] which Amen. A supernatural element still
[1:05:55] remains. Amen. Despite the revelation.
[1:05:58] So when the revelation comes, Amen. the
[1:06:01] revelation does not remove the
[1:06:02] supernatural. Amen. The revelation
[1:06:05] restores the supernatural. Amen. And
[1:06:07] I'll say it like this. Amen. Bethlehem
[1:06:09] was not a natural city. Amen. It was not
[1:06:12] a natural place. It was not just a
[1:06:14] natural little village. Amen. But it was
[1:06:16] a supernatural city. Amen. It was a
[1:06:19] supernatural place. Amen. And that's
[1:06:21] what would inspire a prophet to come and
[1:06:23] say, "Amen. Why little Bethlehem?" Amen.
[1:06:26] Now, how many loves to hear the prophet
[1:06:28] preach on them tapes? Amen. The prophet
[1:06:30] will preach messages. And I love
[1:06:32] sometimes to listen to the ones, Amen.
[1:06:34] that he preaches in the form of
[1:06:36] questions. Amen. Because if his sermon
[1:06:38] Amen. Amen. If his sermon is going to be
[1:06:40] an an a question, Amen. then the the the
[1:06:43] title is going to be a question. Amen.
[1:06:45] Then the sermon is going to be an
[1:06:47] answer. Think about that. Amen. If the
[1:06:49] title is a question, then the sermon is
[1:06:52] going to be an answer. Amen. Like he'll
[1:06:54] say, "Who is God?" Amen. Or he'll
[1:06:56] preach, "Who is this?" Or he'll preach,
[1:06:58] "Who is Jesus?" Or even preach, "Who is
[1:07:00] this Melzdc?" Amen. He'll preach one
[1:07:02] called, "What? Thank you of Christ." And
[1:07:04] and what is that in your hand? Amen.
[1:07:06] What is a vision? And what does it take?
[1:07:08] Amen. To make a Christian life. What is
[1:07:10] the works of God? Amen. What went you
[1:07:12] out to see? What is the Holy Ghost? What
[1:07:14] was the Holy Ghost given for? Amen. What
[1:07:17] shall I do with this Jesus called
[1:07:19] Christ? Amen. What is the attraction on
[1:07:21] the mountain? Amen. How can I overcome?
[1:07:24] Is your life worthy of the gospel? Amen.
[1:07:26] Why I am a holy roller? Amen. Why I am
[1:07:30] praying for the sick? Amen. Why are
[1:07:32] people so tossed about? Why is it so
[1:07:35] many Christians find it so hard, Amen,
[1:07:37] to live the Christian life? Why some
[1:07:39] people, amen, can't keep the victory?
[1:07:41] Why we are not a denomination? Amen.
[1:07:44] Now, I love this one because in the
[1:07:46] title, Amen. He also gives the answer.
[1:07:48] He says, "Why cry?" Amen. Speak. Amen.
[1:07:51] Why cry? Speak. Amen. Why am I against
[1:07:54] organized religion? Amen. Why? It had to
[1:07:57] be shepherd. Amen. See, if there is a
[1:07:59] question, then there must be an answer.
[1:08:01] Amen. But where there is a question,
[1:08:03] there must be an answer. Amen. There it
[1:08:05] is. You now notice this now being an
[1:08:08] answer. Amen. There must be a correct
[1:08:10] answer. And if we get an answer to
[1:08:12] anything and it isn't right, then we
[1:08:14] know that it is wrong. Amen. But there
[1:08:16] it is. Amen. You would still ask until
[1:08:19] the true question, amen, is answered. If
[1:08:21] you want to know the truth and beam,
[1:08:23] this is, Amen, a Bible question. It
[1:08:26] should have a Bible answer. Now, here
[1:08:29] he's preaching the message marriage and
[1:08:31] divorce. And he says, "If there's a
[1:08:33] Bible question," Amen. There's got to be
[1:08:35] a Bible answer. Amen. I'll say it like
[1:08:37] this. Like Jesus said, "Search the
[1:08:39] scriptures." Amen. For in them, Amen.
[1:08:41] You think you have eternal life. Amen.
[1:08:44] But they are they which testify of me.
[1:08:46] Amen. So in the scriptures is where the
[1:08:49] answer is to the question. Amen. It's an
[1:08:52] example of a Bible question here. Where
[1:08:54] is God's chosen place of worship? That's
[1:08:56] not a man's question. That's not a
[1:08:58] preacher's question. That is a biblical
[1:09:01] question. Amen, brother. Where is God's
[1:09:03] chosen place of worship? He said, "Now,
[1:09:05] if it's a Bible question, it's got to
[1:09:07] have a Bible answer. And it should not
[1:09:09] be able to come from a group of men.
[1:09:11] Amen. From any certain fellowship or
[1:09:13] some educator or some denomination. It
[1:09:16] should come straight from the
[1:09:18] scripture." Amen. The question to where
[1:09:20] is, amen, God's provided place of
[1:09:22] worship. It should not be coming from a
[1:09:24] prophet. It should not be coming from a
[1:09:26] evangelist. It should not be coming from
[1:09:28] a pastor. it should be coming. Amen.
[1:09:31] From the scripture. Now, I'll tell you
[1:09:32] like this. And William Brandham was a
[1:09:34] word prophet. Amen. Therefore, when he
[1:09:36] gave you the answer, it was not William
[1:09:38] Brandom's answer. It was the word answer
[1:09:41] concerning the word question. Oh, to
[1:09:43] think this morning, church, where God's
[1:09:45] meeting place is. We now know. Amen.
[1:09:48] We've got the answer to the question.
[1:09:50] Amen. I think of the Queen of Sheba.
[1:09:52] Amen. Who came to prove Solomon. What
[1:09:53] did she come to prove him with? Amen.
[1:09:55] With hard questions. Amen. And Solomon
[1:09:58] told her, Amen, all of her questions.
[1:10:02] Glory to God. Amen. Solomon told her,
[1:10:05] Amen, all of her questions. You know
[1:10:06] what I like about that? Amen. Before the
[1:10:08] Queen of Sheba had the question, Amen.
[1:10:11] God already had the answer. Amen. And
[1:10:13] it's the same way with us today. Amen.
[1:10:16] The world is full of questions. Amen.
[1:10:18] But we're not here preaching from a
[1:10:20] bunch of questions this morning. Amen,
[1:10:22] brother Tom. The world is full of
[1:10:24] questions. Amen. But the message is
[1:10:26] still the answer. Amen. To think this
[1:10:28] morning, there is a man today. And that
[1:10:30] man is Jesus. There is a man that
[1:10:32] understands. Amen. The supernatural.
[1:10:34] There is a man that can interpret this
[1:10:37] age that we're living in. There is a man
[1:10:40] in our midst. And he's got the answer to
[1:10:43] these questions. Who is it? It's the
[1:10:45] Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. The man that is
[1:10:50] in the midst of the church that's got
[1:10:52] the answer to the question is the Lord
[1:10:55] Jesus. Now, now I'll say it like this.
[1:10:56] There are some questions that we are to
[1:10:59] avoid. Amen. For they have no value that
[1:11:01] leads to spiritual growth.
[1:11:04] Is that okay? Amen. There are some
[1:11:06] questions that we are to avoid because
[1:11:09] they have no value that leads to
[1:11:11] spiritual growth. I think of when Paul
[1:11:13] wrote to Timothy. Amen. What he does is
[1:11:15] he addresses these questions in 1
[1:11:17] Timothy 1:4. He says, "Neither give heed
[1:11:20] to fables and to endless genealogies
[1:11:23] which minister questions." Amen. Rather
[1:11:25] than godly edifying, which in faith,
[1:11:27] Amen. So do in 2 Timothy 2:23, but
[1:11:31] foolish and unlearned questions. Amen.
[1:11:34] Avoid knowing that they do gender
[1:11:36] strife. In Titus 3:9, but avoid foolish
[1:11:39] questions and genealogies and and
[1:11:41] contentions and strivings about the law.
[1:11:44] Amen. For they are unprofitable and they
[1:11:46] are vain. Amen. That word question means
[1:11:48] a seeking. It means an inquiry. It means
[1:11:51] a subject of questioning or debate. It
[1:11:53] means something that leads amen to a
[1:11:55] matter of controversy. It means
[1:11:58] something that leads the church to
[1:11:59] controversy. Amen. Rather than lead them
[1:12:02] to stability. Prophet of God said, "When
[1:12:04] I first started out, I wrote a little
[1:12:05] book here and and they asked me a
[1:12:07] question. Is it wrong to smoke? Is it
[1:12:09] wrong to drink? Is it wrong to do so and
[1:12:12] so?" I said, "Don't ask me foolish
[1:12:14] questions. Make this up in your mind. If
[1:12:16] you love the Lord with all your heart,
[1:12:18] you don't smoke, you don't chew, or
[1:12:21] drink any shine." Amen. I still stand by
[1:12:23] that. When the love of God is in your
[1:12:26] heart, Amen. then you've got no time for
[1:12:28] nothing else. Amen. You are sold out. If
[1:12:31] the love of the world or the things of
[1:12:33] the world is because the love of God is
[1:12:35] not in you. He said, "Now listen, if we
[1:12:37] are not Pentecost," Amen. Let's quit
[1:12:39] saying we are until we get back to the
[1:12:41] real Pentecostal experience. Amen. Get
[1:12:43] back, Amen. to faith, which is daring
[1:12:46] faith. Amen. That them disciples sealed
[1:12:49] their death with their faith. And he
[1:12:50] said the faith of the fathers live and
[1:12:52] still in spite of the dungeon, in spite
[1:12:55] of the flame, in spite of the sword.
[1:12:57] That's what we want is real. Amen.
[1:13:00] Genuine faith. That's what we want here
[1:13:03] this morning, church. It's not a bunch
[1:13:05] of Hollywood faith. It's not a bunch of
[1:13:07] man-made faith. Amen. We are looking for
[1:13:10] that real genuine. Amen. Daring faith of
[1:13:13] the living God. It says if I go in the
[1:13:15] dungeon, Amen. God will deliver. If I
[1:13:18] stand before the sword, Amen. God will
[1:13:20] deliver. If I stand before the fire,
[1:13:22] Amen. God will deliver. I'm talking
[1:13:25] about an answer that is coming this age.
[1:13:27] Amen. That didn't produce more
[1:13:28] questions. It didn't produce
[1:13:30] controversy. It didn't produce
[1:13:32] contentions and strivings, but it came
[1:13:34] to produce a stability in the heart of
[1:13:37] the church of the living God. Amen. To
[1:13:39] think brother Brandon was not preaching
[1:13:40] those sermons in the form of questions
[1:13:42] to tear down faith. He was preaching
[1:13:44] those sermons in the form of questions
[1:13:46] to build up faith. Amen. See, the Bible
[1:13:49] says in Colossians 2:7 that you would be
[1:13:52] rooted and built up in him and
[1:13:54] established. Somebody say established.
[1:13:56] Amen. established in the faith as you
[1:13:59] have been taught, abounding therein with
[1:14:01] thanksgiving. Jude will say it like
[1:14:03] this. He will say, "Beloved, building up
[1:14:05] yourselves on your most holy faith."
[1:14:08] Amen. Praying in the Holy Ghost.
[1:14:12] Now, now, can I read you something the
[1:14:13] prophet said? He said, "I want to speak
[1:14:15] to you sometime this week on God's
[1:14:17] unconditional covenant. It's nothing but
[1:14:19] just to build up the faith of the
[1:14:21] people." Yes, sir.
[1:14:23] just to get them built up to a place
[1:14:25] where it gets all the scare away from
[1:14:28] them. And he says the Christian has not
[1:14:30] one worry in the world. They should be
[1:14:33] the most freest, the most happiest
[1:14:35] people in all the world. Are you ready
[1:14:38] for this? Amen. Because you can't lose.
[1:14:42] Oh, glory to God. Amen. You can't lose.
[1:14:46] All things work together for good to
[1:14:48] them that love God. Amen. So, how can we
[1:14:51] lose? There's just nothing to lose, is
[1:14:53] there? We are just anchored in Jesus.
[1:14:56] Amen. Going home to glory. Amen. Having
[1:14:58] a good time while we're going along and
[1:15:01] God providing everything for us. Amen.
[1:15:04] How many is expecting God to do
[1:15:06] something for us? He said he can't do
[1:15:08] nothing for us when we're just all
[1:15:10] drooping around like something about
[1:15:12] half dead. He wants a lively church.
[1:15:15] Amen. He wants the members in there to
[1:15:17] be lively stones. Amen. built up into a
[1:15:20] house of faith that will believe him,
[1:15:23] that will accept him and will take him
[1:15:25] at his word. Amen. See, then faith is
[1:15:27] something more than imagination. Amen.
[1:15:29] But faith is a substance. Amen. Now, how
[1:15:32] does faith come? Amen. Faith comes by
[1:15:35] positionally, Amen. knowing who we are.
[1:15:38] Amen. Not positionally hoping we know
[1:15:40] who we are. Amen. Positionally thinking
[1:15:42] we know who we are. Amen. But
[1:15:44] positionally knowing, Amen. who we are.
[1:15:47] Now, in the the adoption series, the
[1:15:49] prophet says Bible teaching, amen, is
[1:15:51] usually a little treacherous. He said,
[1:15:53] you know, kind of like walking on thin
[1:15:55] ice. He said, at this time, I be I
[1:15:57] believe it'd be a good thing, Amen. to
[1:16:00] bring the church to what I think to a
[1:16:02] complete understanding, amen,
[1:16:04] positionally. Amen. Now, think about
[1:16:06] this. A complete understanding is a
[1:16:09] positionally placed by the word of God.
[1:16:12] Amen. Of what we are in Christ Jesus.
[1:16:14] Amen. Now, preaching usually catches the
[1:16:16] sinner and brings him under condemnation
[1:16:19] by the word. Amen. But teaching places a
[1:16:22] man positionally, amen, what he is. Are
[1:16:25] you ready? And we can never rightly be
[1:16:27] able to have faith until positionally we
[1:16:31] know what we are. As long as you sit in
[1:16:34] church, amen, thinking somebody's going
[1:16:36] to take your place and somebody's going
[1:16:38] to take your position, amen, you'll
[1:16:40] never serve God, amen, to the full
[1:16:43] capacity that he's called you to serve
[1:16:44] him in. Amen. But I'll say it like this.
[1:16:47] Amen. When you come to a place in your
[1:16:49] soul that you know who no matter what
[1:16:51] comes and no matter what goes, you know
[1:16:53] God placed you there. There ain't enough
[1:16:56] devils in all of torment. There ain't
[1:16:58] enough demons in all of hell. There
[1:16:59] ain't enough spirits. Amen. against this
[1:17:02] bride. Amen. To back her off the word of
[1:17:04] God. LISTEN FRIENDS, I'M NOT CONCERNED.
[1:17:07] AMEN. That tomorrow God is going to find
[1:17:09] somebody else. Amen. To take my place in
[1:17:12] the bride of Jesus Christ. Amen. He
[1:17:14] didn't put me in this place. Amen. For
[1:17:16] somebody to come and take it. Oh, come
[1:17:18] on church. And he didn't put you in this
[1:17:20] church. Amen. For some fly by night.
[1:17:23] Amen. To come by and take your position.
[1:17:25] But he put you here. And he positionally
[1:17:27] placed you here with an anointing upon
[1:17:30] your life. Amen. To fulfill, Amen. the
[1:17:33] purpose that he had of you. Amen. From
[1:17:35] before the foundation of the world.
[1:17:38] Hallelujah.
[1:17:39] Amen. Somebody shout, "Can't nobody take
[1:17:41] my place."
[1:17:43] Oh, can't nobody take my place. Are you
[1:17:46] hearing me? Amen. Can't nobody take your
[1:17:48] place, brother. Amen. Amen. When you
[1:17:51] know who you are. Amen. Can't nobody
[1:17:53] take your place. Amen. When you know who
[1:17:55] you are. Amen. I I was talking to a
[1:17:57] brother one time. He said, "We was on a
[1:17:59] minister's meeting and he said a big guy
[1:18:00] walked in, a big preacher, he said that
[1:18:02] was over the head of a false doctrine
[1:18:04] around the message and he said this guy
[1:18:06] come in the room and he said all these
[1:18:08] preachers they all got scattered and got
[1:18:10] nervous and got to got to acting all
[1:18:11] crazy." He said they jumped up and they
[1:18:13] running over there and he said they
[1:18:14] almost bowing at him. He said they were
[1:18:16] saluting him and hugging him, everything
[1:18:18] else. And this brother told me, he said
[1:18:20] the preacher with him said, "Why didn't
[1:18:21] you get up and run over there?" He said,
[1:18:23] "Well, when you know who you are," Amen.
[1:18:25] who comes in the room don't change who
[1:18:26] you are. Amen. And I think that's a good
[1:18:28] point to make here this morning. When
[1:18:30] you know you're a believer, if an
[1:18:32] unbeliever comes in, it don't change
[1:18:34] you. If you know you're a son of God,
[1:18:36] amen, when an unbeliever comes in, it
[1:18:38] don't change you. Amen. You know in who
[1:18:41] you are because you've been positionally
[1:18:43] placed by the God of faith. Amen. The
[1:18:46] fact when Paul was writing to the
[1:18:47] Ephesians, Amen, he was addressing them
[1:18:50] as the faithful in Christ Jesus. Now, do
[1:18:52] you realize Ephesians is not a sermon?
[1:18:55] Amen. Paul was preaching here, amen, to
[1:18:57] the unsaved. Amen. He was preaching to
[1:18:59] the saved. He wasn't preaching to the
[1:19:01] unsaved. He was preaching to the saved.
[1:19:04] Amen. The called out. Amen. The
[1:19:06] separated, the set aside, and the
[1:19:08] faithful in the call. Amen. Do you
[1:19:11] realize the greatest blessing you'll be
[1:19:12] to this church is not your tithing
[1:19:15] account. It's not your bank account.
[1:19:17] It's not how many how MANY DOLLARS YOU
[1:19:19] PUT IN the missionary fund. Amen. The
[1:19:21] greatest blessing you'll be to this
[1:19:23] church is when you become faithful.
[1:19:25] Amen. In the role that God has called
[1:19:27] you, amen, to serve in it. Well, brother
[1:19:30] Andrew, I'm a janitor. Amen. Be the best
[1:19:32] janitor. Amen. There is in the message.
[1:19:35] Amen. Well, I'm just a I'm just a
[1:19:37] musician. Amen. Well, Brother Joe blow
[1:19:39] the dust out OF THAT ORGAN AND CRANK up
[1:19:41] the hallelujah. Amen. Well, I'm just a
[1:19:43] singer. Amen. We'll sing. Amen. Till the
[1:19:46] walls come down. Well, brother Andrew, I
[1:19:48] just get called on to pray. Amen. will
[1:19:51] pray until hell hears your voice. Amen.
[1:19:54] Pray until demons knees begin to knock.
[1:19:57] Come on.
[1:19:58] Are y'all hearing me this morning? I'm
[1:20:00] talking about coming to a place where
[1:20:02] you're faithful in your call. Amen. Now,
[1:20:04] that's where he addresses the believer's
[1:20:06] position in Christ. And the believer can
[1:20:08] only worship Christ as he is
[1:20:11] positionally placed in Christ. A
[1:20:13] believer cannot worship and has no right
[1:20:16] to worship. Amen. the Lord outside of
[1:20:19] being in the body of the Lord Jesus
[1:20:22] Christ. Amen. Now, let me say this. We
[1:20:24] are not just set out in the body of
[1:20:26] Christ. Amen. But we are positionally
[1:20:29] placed in the body of the Lord Jesus
[1:20:32] Christ. Are you ready? Amen. Your
[1:20:34] position comes with some rights. Okay?
[1:20:36] Amen. And you've got a right, amen, to
[1:20:39] worship God this morning as a
[1:20:41] positionally placed bride of the Lord
[1:20:44] Jesus Christ. Listen, friends. Amen.
[1:20:46] That's why we're not backing up. WE'VE
[1:20:48] GOT A RIGHT TO PRAISE GOD. THAT'S WHY
[1:20:50] WE'RE NOT shutting up. We got a right to
[1:20:52] open up our voices. THAT'S WHY WE'RE NOT
[1:20:54] QUIETENING DOWN ON THIS MESSAGE. AMEN.
[1:20:57] By the position that God has placed us
[1:20:59] in has equipped US WITH THE RIGHT, AMEN,
[1:21:02] to be who we are. Let me say it like
[1:21:04] this. Nothing happens by chance. Amen.
[1:21:07] You Oh, help me church. Amen. Nothing
[1:21:09] happens by chance. You're not sitting
[1:21:11] where you're sitting this morning by
[1:21:13] chance. I think of what Paul says. all
[1:21:15] things. Amen. Work together. Amen. For
[1:21:18] the good to them that love God and to
[1:21:20] them who are called according to his
[1:21:22] purpose. You know what that word work
[1:21:24] together means? It means to be a partner
[1:21:27] in labor to bring to an expected end.
[1:21:30] Oh, glory to God. It means things have
[1:21:33] been working together. Amen. When you
[1:21:35] when it didn't make sense to you, things
[1:21:38] were working together. When it didn't
[1:21:40] look like anything good was going to
[1:21:41] come out of the trial, Amen. Things were
[1:21:44] working together when it didn't look
[1:21:45] like anything good was going to come to
[1:21:47] you. Amen. Things were working together
[1:21:50] because our God said all things, Amen.
[1:21:53] work together. Amen. To the good to
[1:21:55] them. Amen. Let me say this with
[1:21:57] everything within me, church. Amen.
[1:21:59] Nothing happened to you by chance. Amen.
[1:22:01] So quit thinking it happened to you by
[1:22:03] chance. Amen. The God who sits high is
[1:22:06] the God that looks low. HE'S THE GOD
[1:22:08] THAT KNOWS THE SECRETS. HE'S THE God
[1:22:10] that knows everything about you. And he
[1:22:13] has been strategically and and and oh
[1:22:15] glory. Amen. And anointed hands has been
[1:22:18] working over your life. Amen. To bring
[1:22:21] you to the place you're in this morning.
[1:22:23] Hallelujah.
[1:22:24] Now, when you realize that, Amen. The
[1:22:27] prophet said nothing happens by chance.
[1:22:29] Everything is ordained of God. Amen. No
[1:22:32] matter what happens, all things are
[1:22:34] going to work together for the good. You
[1:22:36] were all pre-planned by God. Amen.
[1:22:39] Somebody say pre-planned. Amen. You were
[1:22:41] all pre-planned by God. So nothing
[1:22:44] happens by chance with God. He knows all
[1:22:48] about it. Amen. Don't that make you want
[1:22:50] to Don't that make you want to give him
[1:22:51] some praise? Amen. He knows all about
[1:22:54] it. It's all pre-planned. Amen. Planned
[1:22:57] for many generations back. Amen. So you
[1:23:00] could be here today. Think about that.
[1:23:03] Amen. Your great great great great great
[1:23:04] great great great grandfather. Amen.
[1:23:08] Might have had a bullet. Amen. coming
[1:23:10] towards his head in a war somewhere.
[1:23:13] AMEN. BUT GOD WHO SITS high and looks
[1:23:15] low is the pre-planner of all things.
[1:23:18] And he was spared. Amen. Because there
[1:23:20] was a gene in him that had to be
[1:23:23] manifested. Amen. Seven generations
[1:23:25] later. Oh, come on, church. YOU MAY NOT
[1:23:28] THINK anybody cares about you. But I
[1:23:30] come to remind you, THERE IS A GOD WHO
[1:23:32] CARES about you. THERE IS A GOD, AMEN,
[1:23:35] WHO KNOWS EVERYTHING about you. THERE IS
[1:23:37] NOTHING AMEN TAKING GOD by surprise.
[1:23:43] Hey, all things, somebody shout, all
[1:23:46] things has been pre-planned by God.
[1:23:48] Amen. Then let me say it like this.
[1:23:50] Bethlehem, which was a city of Judah,
[1:23:53] Amen, was a prepared place by God. Amen.
[1:23:57] Thou Bethlehem, Amen, though thou be
[1:23:59] little among the thousands of Judah.
[1:24:01] Amen. Yet out of thee, somebody say out
[1:24:04] of thee, Amen, shall come forth unto me
[1:24:07] that is to be ruler in Israel, the
[1:24:09] prophet said, of all the places, amen,
[1:24:11] that is in Palestine, and in there is so
[1:24:14] many great cities and its localities,
[1:24:16] and its cities are seemingly much more
[1:24:18] known in the lore of history, they're
[1:24:20] better fortified, bigger cities. Amen.
[1:24:22] Why should God choose, Amen, little
[1:24:25] Bethlehem, Amen, to be the birthplace of
[1:24:28] his son? Amen. Can I Amen. Can I bring
[1:24:30] this to God's Bethlehem today? Amen. Why
[1:24:33] should God choose? Amen. Word of life
[1:24:35] tabernacle in Hardy, Arkansas. Amen. To
[1:24:38] be the birthplace of the word made flesh
[1:24:41] in this hour. Amen. The scripture said
[1:24:43] what God determines to do, it will be
[1:24:46] done. Amen. God for ordained it to be
[1:24:49] that way or it never would have been
[1:24:52] that way. Amen. Things didn't happen the
[1:24:55] way they happened. Amen. By chance.
[1:24:57] Amen. But God has ordained things to
[1:25:00] happen. Amen. The way they happen or it
[1:25:02] never would have happened. Oh, church of
[1:25:04] the living God. He knowed everything.
[1:25:07] Amen. And it just didn't happen that
[1:25:08] way. It was God that made it that way.
[1:25:12] Now, here's the problem. Amen. We in our
[1:25:14] finite minds, Amen. begin to think it
[1:25:16] over. There's where the trouble comes.
[1:25:18] Is when we let Amen. our finite minds,
[1:25:21] Amen, become our compass. When we let
[1:25:23] our finite minds become our s our north
[1:25:27] star. When we let our finite minds
[1:25:29] become the way we look at things, amen,
[1:25:31] we begin to say, why would the great
[1:25:33] king of heaven, Amen, choose a little
[1:25:35] place like that instead of capital?
[1:25:37] Amen. Notice this. Even there was many
[1:25:40] places who had greater spiritual
[1:25:43] background. Can we say that together?
[1:25:45] Had greater spiritual background than
[1:25:48] what Bethlehem did. Now, now don't leave
[1:25:51] me hanging here, okay? Amen. Amen. Am I
[1:25:53] the only one, Amen, that's ever sat down
[1:25:55] and said, "God, why did you choose me?"
[1:25:58] Is Is there any other humans here, a
[1:26:00] Amen. And am I the only one, Amen, that
[1:26:03] stood in the presence of God where the
[1:26:06] anointing of God is flowing in the
[1:26:08] church? And I've left there and I'VE
[1:26:10] SAID, "GOD, WHY would you choose a piece
[1:26:12] of Tennessee dirt like me, amen, to
[1:26:14] stand in the presence of the resurrected
[1:26:17] Lord? Why would you choose me? Amen. To
[1:26:19] hear such things, Amen. as the seven
[1:26:22] seals. Amen. Why would you choose me?
[1:26:25] Amen. To see such THINGS AS THE MIGHTY
[1:26:27] GOD REVEALED. WHY WOULD YOU CHOOSE ME?
[1:26:30] AMEN. To be sitting, Amen. shouldertosh
[1:26:33] shoulder, amen, with men of God. Amen.
[1:26:35] And with children of God THAT HAVE BEEN
[1:26:37] CALLED OF GOD, ORDAINED OF GOD, elected
[1:26:39] of God, Amen. Why would you choose me?
[1:26:42] Amen. But then he reminds me, I didn't
[1:26:44] choose you. Amen. based on your
[1:26:46] spiritual background. I chose, Amen,
[1:26:49] based on a gene seed that I placed on
[1:26:52] the inside of you from before the
[1:26:54] foundation of the world. Amen. Somebody
[1:26:57] shout it with me. GOD CHOSE ME. HEY, GOD
[1:27:01] CHOSE ME. AMEN. Man didn't choose me,
[1:27:03] but God did. Amen. Man would have left
[1:27:06] me out of the picture. Amen. But God
[1:27:08] said, "You're in the picture." Amen. Man
[1:27:10] would have put me somewhere and said,
[1:27:11] "He's a wasted time. He's a wasted
[1:27:14] space. He's a useless piece of humanity.
[1:27:16] AMEN. BUT GOD, WHO IS RICH IN MERCY,
[1:27:20] AMEN. SAW SOMETHING IN ME THAT HE SAW IN
[1:27:23] BETHLEHEM AND HE CHOSE BETHLEHEM the
[1:27:26] same way he chose me and he chose you.
[1:27:30] Thank you, Lord. Oh, somebody give him a
[1:27:32] hand clap of praise.
[1:27:35] [Applause]
[1:27:36] Man didn't choose us, but God did. Man
[1:27:40] would have left us out, but God put us
[1:27:42] in. Amen. And now when you begin to look
[1:27:44] at what was surrounding Bethlehem, Amen.
[1:27:46] Bethlehem had a lot of reasons, amen, to
[1:27:48] say what she's saying. Why did you
[1:27:50] choose me? Do you realize, brother
[1:27:52] David, there was a place called
[1:27:54] Jerusalem,
[1:27:56] which was the proud capital, Amen, of
[1:27:59] them all. There was a place called
[1:28:01] Shiloh, which was an ancient worship
[1:28:03] place of Israel, where they all came
[1:28:05] year by year to this great place
[1:28:08] where the ark of the Lord rested. Amen.
[1:28:10] THERE WAS A PLACE CALLED GILGAL. AMEN.
[1:28:12] AND IT was another great spiritual place
[1:28:14] of worship. THERE WAS A PLACE CALLED
[1:28:16] ZION which was on the mountaintop. It
[1:28:19] had been a great historical mark of
[1:28:21] where the Lord had blessed his people in
[1:28:23] the ages. Amen. There was a place called
[1:28:25] Hebron for a man who was wanting a city
[1:28:28] of refuge. It was a place of safety.
[1:28:30] Amen. There was a place called Ramoth
[1:28:32] Gilead. It was another place of refuge
[1:28:34] where the people could come which would
[1:28:36] have been very appropriate for him to be
[1:28:38] born. Amen. Amen. Brother Ram said, "If
[1:28:40] I would have had if I would have been
[1:28:41] thinking of it, I would have thought to
[1:28:43] bring him out of Kadesh Barnea." Amen.
[1:28:45] For it was God's judgment seat and a
[1:28:47] place of refuge. Amen. But what that
[1:28:49] shows us here, Amen, is out of all those
[1:28:52] significant cities. Amen. God chose the
[1:28:54] insignificant. Amen. The Bible says,
[1:28:57] Amen. You have omitted the weightier
[1:28:58] matters of the law. Amen. And judgment
[1:29:01] and mercy and faith that you ought to
[1:29:03] have done and not to leave the other
[1:29:05] undone. So, in other words, people
[1:29:07] overlook the small things. As long as
[1:29:10] it's not noticed, as long as it's a
[1:29:12] little city, amen, they won't talk about
[1:29:14] it. Come on, church. Amen. But when God
[1:29:16] does something in it, Amen. Everybody
[1:29:19] starts talking about it. Do you realize
[1:29:21] Jeffersonville, Indiana was another
[1:29:23] place on the map. Amen. Until God raised
[1:29:26] up a prophet out of there. Amen. And now
[1:29:28] Jeffersonville is talked about in the
[1:29:30] villages of India. Amen. In the huts of
[1:29:32] India, in the villages of Africa. Amen.
[1:29:34] in the communist countries of Russia.
[1:29:36] Amen. All over the world. Jeffersonville
[1:29:39] has BEEN TALKED ABOUT. AMEN. NOT BECAUSE
[1:29:41] of what she was. Amen. But because of
[1:29:43] what COME OUT OF IT. OH, GLORY to God.
[1:29:46] Come on, church. Amen. I'm preaching to
[1:29:48] you now. Amen. They didn't see nothing
[1:29:50] in Jeffersonville. Amen. But God said,
[1:29:53] Amen. Out of thee will come a prophet.
[1:29:55] And that same God, Can I preach to you
[1:29:57] for a second? Amen. Amen. Amen. Sabino
[1:29:59] Canyon was another tourist attraction.
[1:30:02] Amen. But you know why hundreds and
[1:30:03] thousands of people flock there? It
[1:30:05] ain't because of the cactus. IT AIN'T
[1:30:07] BECAUSE of something on the mountain.
[1:30:09] IT'S BECAUSE OF WHAT GOD AMEN. RAISED
[1:30:11] UP. In other words, what I'm saying, as
[1:30:14] long as it's ex insignificant, nobody
[1:30:16] talks about it. But when something's
[1:30:18] done that brings some significance to
[1:30:20] it, then everybody BEGINS TO TALK ABOUT
[1:30:22] IT. AND I'LL SAY THIS. AMEN. this
[1:30:25] church. Amen. These families, amen, you
[1:30:27] individuals. Amen. We was all a bunch of
[1:30:29] overlooked. Amen. Insignificant
[1:30:32] nobodies. ON THE BACK SIDE OF THE
[1:30:34] MISSOURI, on the back side OF HOT
[1:30:36] SPRINGS, ARKANSAS, ON THE BACK SIDE OF
[1:30:38] TENNESSEE. AMEN. ON THE BACK SIDE OF
[1:30:40] LOUISIANA. AMEN. But God said the world
[1:30:43] don't see nothing good in them. Amen.
[1:30:45] But when I get done with them, they'll
[1:30:46] be more than boys and girls. They'll be
[1:30:49] more than fathers. They will be Messiah.
[1:30:52] Thank you, Lord.
[1:30:53] HALLELUJAH.
[1:30:55] OH, GLORY TO GOD. WHEN GOD gets done, it
[1:30:58] ain't no telling. Oh, they'll come from
[1:31:00] the east and they'll come from the west.
[1:31:03] Amen. To behold what the Lord has done.
[1:31:05] Thank you, Jesus.
[1:31:07] Oh, the prophet said sometimes, are you
[1:31:09] ready for this? It's the little things
[1:31:11] that hold the big things together. Woo!
[1:31:13] Glory. And when we get faith like that,
[1:31:16] we begin to think, who is behind all
[1:31:18] this? Amen. What is the main spring that
[1:31:20] is turning this great economy of God? We
[1:31:23] find it's the Holy Spirit. Amen. It's
[1:31:25] not left in the hands of man to do
[1:31:28] things, but it's in the hands of the
[1:31:31] Holy Spirit, and he is the main spring.
[1:31:34] And if he can get the rest of the
[1:31:37] instruments, it'll work just perfectly
[1:31:39] and keep exactly God's time. Are you
[1:31:41] ready? And then we see that and we
[1:31:43] wonder in our mind then if we look at
[1:31:46] great things, how that we would have
[1:31:48] them. And then it gives us a lot of
[1:31:49] consolation today to think that maybe if
[1:31:52] we are a little group of people, maybe
[1:31:54] if we are insignificant to the world and
[1:31:56] to the bigger churches of denominations,
[1:31:59] yet God chose little things sometimes.
[1:32:03] Oh, God's program is not run by the
[1:32:06] hands of man, nor the finite mind of
[1:32:09] man. Amen. But God's program is run by
[1:32:13] the hands of the Holy Spirit and the
[1:32:15] infinite mind of the almighty God. Now,
[1:32:18] how many knows there's a finite mind
[1:32:21] and there's an infinite mind. Amen. Have
[1:32:23] you ever wondered what the difference
[1:32:24] is? Amen. Between a finite mind and an
[1:32:26] infinite mind. Can I tell you? Amen. A
[1:32:28] finite mind, amen, has limits and
[1:32:30] bounds. It can only think so far. It can
[1:32:33] only see so far. Amen. But an infinite
[1:32:36] mind, amen, is limitless. It is endless
[1:32:39] in space. It is extent or size. It is
[1:32:42] impossible. Amen. To measure or
[1:32:45] calculate, Amen. We can measure a finite
[1:32:47] mind. We can calculate the thoughts of a
[1:32:50] finite mind. Amen. But it is impossible.
[1:32:53] Amen. To calculate, Amen. the thoughts
[1:32:56] OF THE MIND OF ALMIGHTY GOD. COME ON,
[1:32:58] CHURCH. AMEN. What did God tell Abraham?
[1:33:00] He said, Abraham, go number the grains
[1:33:02] of sand. And as the grains of sand are,
[1:33:05] Amen. So shall thy seed be. What did he
[1:33:07] tell Paul in Hebrews 12? He said, "We
[1:33:10] have come to Mount Zion where there is
[1:33:12] an innumerable amount of angels." Are
[1:33:14] you hearing me, church? Amen. When God
[1:33:16] gets done, you can't calculate. You
[1:33:19] can't PUT IN A BOX WHAT GOD OH, church
[1:33:21] of the living God. We can't calculate
[1:33:24] all the demons that have been defeated
[1:33:25] here this weekend. We can't calculate
[1:33:28] all the spirits, Amen. that have felt
[1:33:30] powerless before the church of the
[1:33:32] living God. But there's one thing I can
[1:33:34] say. Amen. God was in Bethlehem this
[1:33:36] weekend. Amen. God was in the church
[1:33:38] this weekend. And what God blesses,
[1:33:41] Amen. No man can curse. And what God
[1:33:43] anoints, ain't, no man can disanoint.
[1:33:46] Amen. What God sees fit, no man can call
[1:33:48] unfit. When God says, "Out of Bethlehem,
[1:33:51] there is coming a ruler. Stand back,
[1:33:54] devil. There is coming a ruler." When
[1:33:56] God says, "Out of Bethlehem, I'm going
[1:33:58] to raise up the greatest. Stand back,
[1:34:00] devil. Out of Bethlehem is coming the
[1:34:03] greatest."
[1:34:04] Thank you, Lord.
[1:34:05] Oh, there is nothing. Somebody shout
[1:34:07] nothing impossible with the infinite
[1:34:10] mind of God. Amen. For with the mind of
[1:34:13] man this is impossible. Amen. But with
[1:34:15] God all things, amen, are possible. You
[1:34:18] know what that word impossible means?
[1:34:20] Without strength. But you know what that
[1:34:22] word possible means? It means able,
[1:34:24] powerful, mighty, strong. Amen. Strong
[1:34:27] in soul. Amen. How many How many strong
[1:34:29] souls
[1:34:32] have we got here this morning? Amen.
[1:34:34] They're strong to bear calamities.
[1:34:36] They're strong to bear trials with
[1:34:38] fortitude and patience. They are able to
[1:34:41] do something. They are excaling in
[1:34:43] something. Prophet said, "Our little
[1:34:44] infinite mind sometimes can't comprehend
[1:34:47] what you are, but we believe you
[1:34:49] anyhow." Amen. Now, do you realize why?
[1:34:51] Amen. These things are so hard to
[1:34:53] comprehend by the finite mind is because
[1:34:56] Paul says they are spiritually
[1:34:58] discerned. Amen. The door, Amen, is
[1:35:01] spiritual sight. You just only want to
[1:35:03] see one thing. That's what the
[1:35:04] intellectual sees. But when you let
[1:35:06] Christ, amen, come into that spiritual
[1:35:08] door, then he will open up your
[1:35:10] spiritual sides and will show you
[1:35:13] himself. Amen. In other words, the
[1:35:15] infinite mind, Amen, will discern the
[1:35:18] thoughts and will show you what the
[1:35:20] finite mind cannot see. Amen. The finite
[1:35:23] mind, Amen, cannot see Lucifer's heart.
[1:35:26] Could not see the destruction. Could not
[1:35:28] see the desires. Could not see Satan's
[1:35:30] ambition that was buried in Lucifer's
[1:35:32] heart. Amen. But the infinite mind of
[1:35:34] God, amen, could stand there and could
[1:35:37] say, "In your heart, you have said, I
[1:35:39] will be like the most high God." In your
[1:35:41] heart, you have said, "I will exalt my
[1:35:44] stars above the stars of God. I will
[1:35:46] exalt my throne above the throne of
[1:35:48] God." And the prophet said, "See that
[1:35:50] who's on our side today is the infinite
[1:35:53] God."
[1:35:55] Come on, church. It's Sunday morning.
[1:35:57] Quit looking at me and sleeping. Help me
[1:35:59] preach. Amen. Who is on OUR SIDE? AMEN.
[1:36:02] I'LL tell you who's on our side. Amen.
[1:36:04] The God that knows the end from the
[1:36:06] beginning. Amen. And everything in
[1:36:08] between. Amen. The God who can look at
[1:36:10] the enemy and can tell you what the
[1:36:12] enemy is going to do before the enemy
[1:36:14] has time. Amen. To concoct his plan
[1:36:17] together. Oh church, I'll tell you what
[1:36:19] a prophet said. He said, "What are we
[1:36:21] scared about?" Amen. If he is known, if
[1:36:23] he's the living God, Amen. He knows all
[1:36:26] things. You don't have a limited God.
[1:36:28] Amen. God is unlimited. He said way back
[1:36:32] before the foundation of the world when
[1:36:34] Satan done the evil. Amen. Because Satan
[1:36:36] had in his mind he was going to do.
[1:36:39] AMEN. BUT GOD SEEN IT AND HE KNEW HOW to
[1:36:41] counteract it. Amen. Before Lucifer ever
[1:36:44] fell, God already had a plan to overcome
[1:36:47] Lucifer. Oh church, Amen. before the
[1:36:50] trial ever come upon you. Amen. The
[1:36:53] infinite God, Amen, saw you coming OUT
[1:36:55] OF IT. SHAMGAR BEFORE 600 Philistines
[1:36:59] ever even showed up. The infinite God,
[1:37:02] amen, saw him laying on the ground in
[1:37:04] defeat. Oh, brother Harvey. Amen. Before
[1:37:07] you was ever even born, the infinite
[1:37:09] God, Amen, saw you sitting at the
[1:37:13] marriage supper of the lamb with your
[1:37:15] family.
[1:37:16] Thank you, Jesus.
[1:37:18] Hallelujah.
[1:37:19] Amen. I'm preaching to you now. Amen.
[1:37:21] YOUR YOUR YOUR FINITE MIND. It can't see
[1:37:24] these things. But we have the mind of
[1:37:26] Christ. We can see beyond the limits. We
[1:37:29] can see beyond the boundaries. We can
[1:37:31] see beyond time.
[1:37:32] Thank you, Lord.
[1:37:34] Hallelujah.
[1:37:36] Thank you, Lord.
[1:37:37] Now, now, now what you got to do is you
[1:37:39] got to realize finite way of thinking
[1:37:41] grounds a church.
[1:37:43] Come on, preach.
[1:37:44] I said finite way of thinking grounds a
[1:37:46] church. You let a preacher get a vision
[1:37:49] and you let a finite weight think faking
[1:37:50] get in the way and that church won't go
[1:37:52] nowhere.
[1:37:53] Well, let's preach a minute here. We
[1:37:55] might as well.
[1:37:57] [Music]
[1:37:58] You let a pastor get a vision for a
[1:38:00] church and you let somebody get in a
[1:38:02] position that's got an infinite mind,
[1:38:03] that's got a finite mind, they'll ground
[1:38:05] the vision.
[1:38:08] Well, let's preach a minute here. Amen.
[1:38:10] People say, "Amen." Brother shared with
[1:38:12] me one time said, "Oh, God, I'm getting
[1:38:15] in trouble." said, 'Well, said, 'I got
[1:38:17] on my heart to do this, and I got on my
[1:38:18] heart to do that. He said, 'Gy come to
[1:38:20] me and said, 'Well, we ain't going to do
[1:38:21] that cuz we can't afford it.' He said,
[1:38:23] 'Well, look here. You're talking to a
[1:38:24] guy who's seen God put money in bank
[1:38:26] accounts, who's seen God put gas in
[1:38:28] tanks. He said, I'm not going to let the
[1:38:30] finite way, Amen, of thinking we can't
[1:38:32] afford to do something for God, Amen,
[1:38:34] grounded. Amen. I'll tell you this,
[1:38:36] church. Amen. If God is on your side,
[1:38:38] Amen, the money will come. Amen. If God
[1:38:41] is on your side, amen, the people will
[1:38:44] No, I'm not preaching prosperity. I'm
[1:38:46] telling you, get rid of that finite way
[1:38:48] of thinking that's been grounding you
[1:38:50] for so long. That finite way of thinking
[1:38:52] won't let you raise your hands because
[1:38:53] you're afraid, amen, something's going
[1:38:55] to get out of order. That finite way of
[1:38:57] thinking gets all grounded when the
[1:38:59] spirit begins to move because you sat in
[1:39:01] a church SOMEWHERE AND YOU SAW SOMETHING
[1:39:03] HAPPEN THAT was out of the line of God's
[1:39:05] word. Amen. BUT GET RID OF THAT FINITE
[1:39:07] way of thinking. Amen. and pray that
[1:39:09] God, amen, would come in your mind this
[1:39:11] morning and would put an infinite mind
[1:39:13] in there THAT WOULD SAY, "GOD, I'M going
[1:39:15] to trust you." Amen. Brother Paul, you
[1:39:17] shared that testimony with me last
[1:39:18] night. Amen. That man come to you in the
[1:39:21] face of every obstacle, in the face of
[1:39:23] every negativity, AND SAID, "BUT CHIEF,
[1:39:25] you're going to give me a job." Amen. If
[1:39:26] he had a finite mind, he would have
[1:39:28] never claimed it. Amen. But there was an
[1:39:30] infinite mind resting THERE THAT SAID,
[1:39:32] "MY GOD IS ABLE." OH CHURCH OF THE
[1:39:34] LIVING GOD, WORD OF LIFE TABERNACLE, GOD
[1:39:37] IS ON YOUR SIDE. AMEN. THE INFINITE GOD
[1:39:39] IS ON YOUR SIDE. He is behind you. He is
[1:39:43] your support. David said, "When I need
[1:39:45] help, where will I look? I will look
[1:39:48] unto the heels from which cometh my
[1:39:50] help." Come on, church. Quit looking
[1:39:52] around at all these temporary things
[1:39:54] that's ground in your faith and look
[1:39:57] UNTO THE SAME HEELS THAT David looked to
[1:40:00] and witness the SAME GOD THAT SAID I
[1:40:03] WILL COME TO THEE and I will bless thee.
[1:40:06] Thank you Lord.
[1:40:07] Hallelujah.
[1:40:09] Thank you Lord.
[1:40:11] Prophet said we become so earthbound
[1:40:13] with our finite way of thinking. Amen.
[1:40:15] To his great infinite mind that we just
[1:40:17] get one little course set up and we feel
[1:40:19] like we're just going fine. But if we
[1:40:20] could only look and see. Amen. As God
[1:40:23] sees, how much different things would
[1:40:24] look.
[1:40:28] If we can only look and see, Amen. as
[1:40:30] God thinks, how much different, Amen.
[1:40:33] things would look.
[1:40:35] Are y'all hearing me? If we can only
[1:40:37] look and see how God looks, how much
[1:40:39] different things would look. If we can
[1:40:41] only look through the eyes of a
[1:40:42] prophetic lens and see what a prophet
[1:40:44] saw, how different we would TALK ABOUT
[1:40:46] POLITICS. HOW DIFFERENT OH, come on,
[1:40:49] church. How different we would talk
[1:40:51] about the world's problems if we could
[1:40:53] only climb up. Amen. Above this finite
[1:40:55] way of fa you know what a finite way of
[1:40:58] thinking says. A finite way of thinking
[1:41:00] says the world's running out of gas
[1:41:01] right now. So I better stay home.
[1:41:04] It' be safer for me to be home. Amen.
[1:41:06] They got a gas shortage right now. So
[1:41:08] you know what I better do? I better just
[1:41:09] stay home. Amen. But that finite way of
[1:41:11] thinking, Amen. would ground. Amen. It
[1:41:13] would Oh, come on, church. I'm using a
[1:41:16] simple illustration here. Amen. You know
[1:41:17] what it would have done? Amen. It would
[1:41:19] have kept me home. It would have kept us
[1:41:21] out of these meetings. We wouldn't be
[1:41:22] together. Amen. But you know what? Amen.
[1:41:24] I left here last night, needed some gas.
[1:41:26] And I went down here to Valero and they
[1:41:28] didn't have none. And you know what that
[1:41:29] old devil said? Amen. You ain't going to
[1:41:31] make it home. Amen. They're in a gas
[1:41:33] sorted. See, you shouldn't have come on
[1:41:34] this trip. Amen. But I just know this.
[1:41:36] If my God can turn water into wine,
[1:41:38] Amen. My God can turn water into
[1:41:40] gasoline. And I FOUND SOME G. WHAT ARE
[1:41:43] YOU SAYING, PREACHER? I'M SAYING QUIT
[1:41:45] LETTING THAT OLD DEVILISH WAY OF FINITE
[1:41:47] THINKING, AMEN, ground you, amen, from
[1:41:49] seeing miracles, from seeing signs. And
[1:41:52] well, brother Andy, WE'RE JUST A SMALL
[1:41:53] CHURCH. I DIDN'T ASK YOU HOW MANY
[1:41:55] MEMBERS YOU GOT. I didn't ask you how
[1:41:57] much money is in THE BANK ACCOUNT. I
[1:41:58] COME TO TELL YOU, IF YOU BELIEVE GOD,
[1:42:01] YOU'LL SEE THE IMPOSSIBLE. AMEN. BECOME
[1:42:03] POSSIBLE.
[1:42:05] Come on, church. Well, Brother Andrew,
[1:42:07] let's talk ABOUT ANOTHER CHURCH. NO,
[1:42:09] LET'S TALK ABOUT THIS CHURCH. AMEN.
[1:42:11] WELL, LET'S TALK ABOUT WHAT GOD'S DOING
[1:42:12] SOMEWHERE ELSE. NO, LET'S TALK ABOUT
[1:42:14] WHAT GOD is doing right here in
[1:42:17] Bethlehem TODAY. IF HE DID IT A THOUSAND
[1:42:20] YEARS AGO, HE'S STILL DOING IT TODAY.
[1:42:24] Thank you, Lord. Hallelujah.
[1:42:26] He's just looking for somebody who will
[1:42:28] dare to trust him. HE'S JUST LOOKING FOR
[1:42:31] SOMEBODY WHO WILL TAKE A STEP OF FAITH
[1:42:33] and say, "I look crazy to the world. I
[1:42:36] LOOK RADICAL TO HUMANITY, BUT I KNOW GOD
[1:42:38] DROPPED IN MY HEART, AMEN, to stand
[1:42:41] where I'm standing." AMEN. TO BELIEVE
[1:42:43] WHAT I'M BELIEVING. AMEN. TO WORSHIP
[1:42:46] LIKE I'M WORSHIPING. AND THERE ain't no
[1:42:48] DEVIL GOING TO BACK ME OFF OF IT. I KNOW
[1:42:52] IN WHOM IS ON MY SIDE.
[1:42:54] THANK YOU, LORD. HALLELUJAH.
[1:42:56] Thank you, Jesus. Thank you, Lord.
[1:42:59] God is on OUR SIDE.
[1:43:02] GOD is on our side. The devil may be
[1:43:05] against us and the odds may be stacked
[1:43:08] against us. AMEN. BUT IF GOD IS ON OUR
[1:43:10] SIDE, THIS HILL, THIS mountain ain't no
[1:43:13] hill to a climber. Have we got any
[1:43:16] climbers here? HAVE WE GOT ANY CLIMBERS
[1:43:18] HERE? Anybody want to go higher? Anybody
[1:43:21] want to go higher? Well, brother Andrew,
[1:43:23] I can't go no higher. Oh, yes you can.
[1:43:25] You've left that finite way of thinking.
[1:43:27] Amen. Keep you on the first rung. Amen.
[1:43:30] OF JACOB'S LADDER. BUT IT'S TIME TO GET
[1:43:32] UP. IT'S TIME TO START CLIMBING. IT'S
[1:43:34] TIME TO start climbing in Revelation.
[1:43:36] It's time to leave the past behind. Come
[1:43:38] on, Bethlehem. Everything was against
[1:43:41] you. Amen. But God was for you in the
[1:43:44] face of every spirit THAT SAID THAT
[1:43:46] CHURCH IS INSIGNIFICANT. THAT PULLPIT IS
[1:43:48] INSIGNIFICANT. THEM PREACHERS are
[1:43:50] insignificant. God said, "Out of thee
[1:43:53] will come a bride."
[1:43:54] Hallelujah.
[1:43:55] Thank you, Lord.
[1:43:57] Hallelujah.
[1:43:59] Thank you, Lord.
[1:44:00] Thank you.
[1:44:02] Now,
[1:44:02] thank you, Lord.
[1:44:03] The human mind is not capable to
[1:44:06] interpret the mind of God. Yeah.
[1:44:09] Come on.
[1:44:10] Are you with me?
[1:44:11] The human mind is not capable
[1:44:15] of interpreting the the mind of God.
[1:44:19] It's like a canary brain talking to a
[1:44:21] human brain.
[1:44:24] There's no connection.
[1:44:27] Come on. Preach.
[1:44:30] Come on.
[1:44:33] It's like an unbeliever
[1:44:35] trying to tell a believer how to
[1:44:36] believe.
[1:44:38] Come on.
[1:44:40] Come on.
[1:44:42] Are are you
[1:44:44] Are you hearing me? The canary brain,
[1:44:47] the mind of God, the mind of the
[1:44:49] infinite mind of God and the infinite
[1:44:50] mind of man. The infinite mind of man
[1:44:52] trying to tell the the finite the inf
[1:44:54] the finite mind of the man trying to
[1:44:57] tell the infinite mind of God how to run
[1:44:59] the church is like an unbeliever trying
[1:45:00] to tell a believer how to get healed.
[1:45:03] Are are y'all hearing me? Amen. A amen.
[1:45:06] Infinite the infinite mind of God and
[1:45:08] the the finite mind of a man. Amen. The
[1:45:10] finite mind of a man. Amen. Trying to
[1:45:12] tell Amen. The the infinite mind of God
[1:45:15] something is like a preacher that ain't
[1:45:16] ever preached one sermon trying to tell
[1:45:17] a veteran how to preach. Might
[1:45:22] as well preach here a minute, haven't
[1:45:23] we? Are y'all hearing me? Amen. Amen.
[1:45:25] Amen. They're They're not in the same
[1:45:27] category. Are Are y'all hearing me,
[1:45:28] church? Amen. And I'll say it like this.
[1:45:30] This church is not in THE SAME CATEGORY
[1:45:32] AS THE church down the street. This
[1:45:34] ain't no Baptist lodge. This ain't no
[1:45:36] Methodist lodge. This ain't no
[1:45:38] Pentecostal barnyard. This is where
[1:45:40] eagles have gathered to believe for the
[1:45:42] impossible. To believe all things are
[1:45:44] still possible to them that believe.
[1:45:48] Thank you, Jesus. What are you saying?
[1:45:50] I'm saying, "Fear not, little flock. It
[1:45:52] is your father's goodwill." Amen. To
[1:45:54] give you the kingdom. Now, now you say,
[1:45:55] "Well, brother Andrew, we're in the
[1:45:56] minority." Amen. Do you realize Israel
[1:45:58] was in the minority?
[1:46:02] Are y'all hearing me? Israel was in the
[1:46:04] minority. You know how Israel came into
[1:46:06] Palestine? They came in by a promise of
[1:46:08] God. Now, if you study, you'll find,
[1:46:10] Amen, that Joshua divided each tribe
[1:46:12] their portion, Amen, by inspiration. He
[1:46:14] gave each portion a each tribe a portion
[1:46:17] by inspiration.
[1:46:19] In other words, he positionally placed
[1:46:22] them,
[1:46:24] by inspiration. The prophet said the
[1:46:26] same inspiration,
[1:46:28] come on,
[1:46:29] that led Joshua to place those tribes
[1:46:32] which the mothers in their birth pains,
[1:46:34] amen, screamed out their names. He said
[1:46:37] that's the same inspiration that wrote
[1:46:39] the Bible. Now, now think about this.
[1:46:41] Amen. When Judah was getting his part of
[1:46:43] the land, this little city of Bethlehem
[1:46:45] was not even mentioned. Even though
[1:46:47] those mothers in their labor pains had
[1:46:50] positionally placed them where they'd
[1:46:52] been the promised land, amen, hundreds
[1:46:54] of years later. Now, when you look in,
[1:46:56] and I'm just going to paraphrase here,
[1:46:57] when you look in 1 Chronicles 2, you're
[1:46:59] going to find, amen, that Caleb's son
[1:47:01] Salma, Amen, was the father or the
[1:47:03] founder of Bethlehem. Now, the prophet
[1:47:05] said, in other words, he must have moved
[1:47:07] in there and started some sort of
[1:47:09] business and commercial. Amen. Uh the
[1:47:11] trading and so forth that grew it up.
[1:47:12] And later we find out the real reason of
[1:47:14] it. Now, are you ready? Amen. The real
[1:47:16] reason that they left Bethlehem out of
[1:47:18] the picture. He said the real reason of
[1:47:20] it was the whole lands was jealous of
[1:47:24] that little piece of land.
[1:47:29] Are y'all hearing me? Amen. Jerusalem,
[1:47:32] Gilgal, Hebron, Zion, Amen. Rama,
[1:47:35] Gileian, all those places were jealous,
[1:47:38] amen, of the little Bethlehem. Amen. You
[1:47:40] know why? Because it laced to the north
[1:47:42] and east and slopes a little to the
[1:47:44] south on that spur. And it was the most
[1:47:46] fertile, amen, of all Palestine. It was
[1:47:48] a corn belt and a wheat belt. And there
[1:47:51] were great olive orchards and so forth
[1:47:53] in that part of Bethlehem. The end of
[1:47:54] Judah's province. Now, here's why they
[1:47:56] got jealous. Because they was over
[1:47:58] there, Amen. putting stuff in the ground
[1:48:00] to make it work. And Bethlehem looked
[1:48:03] insignificant.
[1:48:05] Bethlehem. Amen. Amen. Amen. It was just
[1:48:08] in Bethlehem's jeans. Amen. To manifest
[1:48:11] olive orchards. Oh God. It was just in
[1:48:14] Bethlehem's genes. Amen. To be a fertile
[1:48:16] place of ground. Amen. They were trying
[1:48:18] to make something happen. Amen. And
[1:48:20] Bethlehem had SOMETHING ON THE INSIDE of
[1:48:23] her. Amen. Working on the outside. AMEN.
[1:48:26] MANIFESTING. AMEN. THE PROMISES of her
[1:48:28] life. Oh, church of the living God.
[1:48:30] Amen. Don't you see why the devil hates
[1:48:32] you? Amen. Because he's trying to
[1:48:33] manufacture something. He's trying to
[1:48:35] make something happen. He's trying to
[1:48:37] make something work. Amen. But right
[1:48:39] here this morning. Can I let you in on a
[1:48:42] little secret? Can I let you in on a
[1:48:43] little secret, brother? You know why
[1:48:44] they was jealous of Bethlehem? Because
[1:48:46] the spirit of prophecy, Amen, had spoke
[1:48:49] over her. And there was nothing could
[1:48:51] change it. There was nothing could
[1:48:52] reverse it. There was nothing that could
[1:48:54] back up prophecy. Amen. AND WHILE THEY

[1:54:08] Come on.
[1:54:09] But I can't make enough out of it.
[1:54:12] Are y'all hearing me? Amen. When I was
[1:54:14] when I was studying this thought on
[1:54:15] Bethlehem back home. Amen. There was a
[1:54:17] brother in our church. He's a deacon. He

[1:54:20] we was talking. He said, "But Andrew,"
[1:54:22] he said, "A few years ago," he said, "we
[1:54:24] went to Israel." And he said, "We went
[1:54:25] down there and toured." And he said,
[1:54:28] "While we were touring," he said the
[1:54:29] tour guide took us by Bethlehem.
[1:54:31] He said, "I don't know if this will help
[1:54:32] you or not in your studies." I was
[1:54:35] actually in my office studying for for
[1:54:36] the Sunday morning meeting the next
[1:54:37] morning. And he come by, we was talking
[1:54:39] and I actually got to a spot in my
[1:54:41] study. I you preachers know what I'm
[1:54:43] talking about brother. Y'all know that
[1:54:45] when you get to that spot, it feels like
[1:54:46] you're trying to break over Josh, you
[1:54:48] got you got your thoughts lined up, but
[1:54:49] you can't just break over that little
[1:54:51] point, you know. And I was there and I
[1:54:52] was just praying and reading a little
[1:54:53] bit. Well, brother, come by and I got I
[1:54:55] went outside and I was talking to him in
[1:54:56] the driveway. Be

[1:55:02] Nazareth? Philip say, "Come and see."
[1:55:04] Amen. And you know what I want to say
[1:55:06] for just a few moments here now? Can
[1:55:08] anything good come out of Bethlehem.
[1:55:12] A city of losers with no support, with
[1:55:15] no backing, with no recognition, with
[1:55:17] nothing. Amen. But but but prophecy.
[1:55:20] Hallelujah.
[1:55:22] Thank you, Lord.
[1:55:24] THANK YOU, JESUS.
[1:55:25] BETHLEHEM ONLY HAD PROPHECY, BUT SHE HAD
[1:55:27] ALL SHE NEEDED.
[1:55:28] HALLELUJAH.

[1:56:02] with some olive orchards.

[1:56:06] And all the all the great cities with
[1:56:08] spiritual backgrounds call some losers.

[1:56:19] there?
[1:56:20] Can I start with the first one? Her
[1:56:21] name's Rahab.
[1:56:25] Hallelujah. Now, let me just stop and
[1:56:27] say they didn't come to the conclusion
[1:56:30] that Bethlehem was a city full of losers
[1:56:33] without there being some material there
[1:56:35] to back up that confession.
[1:56:43] Brother Ben, there was legitimate
[1:56:45] material
[1:56:46] to back up Rahab being a loser.
[1:56:51] How much time have I got this morning?
[1:56:53] all day.
[1:56:55] I'm hurrying.
[1:56:56] Come on.
[1:56:57] She was a harlot.
[1:57:00] Come on.
[1:57:00] She was a beautiful young lady. By some
[1:57:02] misfortune of life, she was forced into
[1:57:04] the life she was living.
[1:57:07] Come on.
[1:57:08] BUT SHE HEARD THERE WAS A God
[1:57:11] who you could pray to and he would
[1:57:13] answer back.
[1:57:15] Brother Joe, she heard THERE WAS A GOD.
[1:57:17] IF YOU GOT A QUESTION,
[1:57:20] he's got the answer. Thank you, Lord.
[1:57:23] SHE HEARD THERE WAS A GOD WHO WAS A
[1:57:25] LIVING GOD. SHE HEARD he could perform
[1:57:28] miracles and could dry up the seas and
[1:57:30] could rain bread out of heaven. AND
[1:57:32] SOMETHING BEGAN TO PULSATE in her heart.
[1:57:38] Jerusalem, Zion, Hebron, Ramoff, Gilead,
[1:57:40] Gilgal, Amen, Kanes, Barnea, ALL SAID
[1:57:43] THEY WERE LOSERS. BUT THERE was a
[1:57:46] pulsation in the heart of a harlot.
[1:57:50] And she received the message. Amen. Then
[1:57:52] she went quickly and she accepted it
[1:57:54] with all of her heart and there was a
[1:57:56] scarlet cord bound at her window for
[1:57:57] protection of her house because she
[1:57:59] received the message. Are you ready for
[1:58:01] this? And Rahab was the type of the
[1:58:04] gentile bride who quickly received the
[1:58:08] message. It was placed in her heart.
[1:58:10] Amen. Notice this. And when THE WALLS
[1:58:13] COME DOWN, nothing touched Rahab. She
[1:58:18] was under the protection of prophecy.
[1:58:21] THANK YOU, LORD.
[1:58:22] OH, GOD. She was under the protection of
[1:58:26] a scarlet cord, brother Tom. That was
[1:58:28] typing the blood that would come IN THE
[1:58:30] LAST DAYS. That would be the protection
[1:58:33] of a true God. Amen. To a true believer.
[1:58:36] No matter what state you're in, when he
[1:58:38] finds you, if you'll just accept that
[1:58:41] scarlet cord, nothing will hurt you.
[1:58:46] Thank you, LORD. OH GOD. HEY RAHAB.
[1:58:50] AMEN. You're a loser. Amen. But you're a
[1:58:53] protected loser. Woo. Glory. YOU'RE
[1:58:57] AMEN. YOU'RE A HARLOT. AMEN. AND OH,
[1:58:59] come on, church. Amen. King's palaces
[1:59:02] were going TO FALL. AMEN. MIGHTY MEN'S
[1:59:04] HOMES were going to fall. AMEN. BUT GOD
[1:59:07] LOOKED UP ON THE HEART OF A HARLOT IN
[1:59:09] THE CITY OF BETHLEHEM AND SAID, "WHEN
[1:59:12] everybody else's house falls," Amen.
[1:59:14] Rahab will go from being the loser,
[1:59:17] Amen, TO BEING THE WINNER. OH, HELP ME
[1:59:20] PREACH SOMEBODY. AMEN. When God gets
[1:59:22] done with you, Amen. The losers will be
[1:59:24] the winners and the winners will be the
[1:59:26] losers.
[1:59:29] Hallelujah.
[1:59:31] Feeling mighty fine right now.
[1:59:34] Well, brother Andrew, all God done was
[1:59:36] bless Rahab. Amen. And kept her safe.
[1:59:38] No, that's not all that happened. Amen.
[1:59:39] She was taken in as one of the
[1:59:41] Israelites. And she fell in love with a
[1:59:44] captain in the Israelite army and a
[1:59:46] prince in Judah whose name was Salmon.
[1:59:50] Are y'all hearing me? She went from
[1:59:52] walking the streets, from being a
[1:59:54] harlot, from being a prostitute to being
[1:59:57] recognized by the Israelite priest. She
[2:00:00] went from living IN A HOUSE OF
[2:00:01] PROSTITUTION, AMEN, TO living in the
[2:00:04] HOUSE OF A PRINCE. HALLELUJAH.
[2:00:09] OH, I wish somebody take the brakes off
[2:00:11] and have church here for a minute.
[2:00:13] THEY GOT married and they lived in
[2:00:15] Bethlehem.
[2:00:17] Are y'all hearing me? And the promise
[2:00:19] didn't begin to open up Bethlehem while
[2:00:21] she lived there. Gentile bride being to
[2:00:22] a Jew through her conversion and through
[2:00:25] her unfailing faith in God. It brought
[2:00:27] her, somebody shout, it brought her from
[2:00:30] an from a house of prostitution to a
[2:00:33] beautiful home.
[2:00:36] Thank you, Lord.
[2:00:39] Thank you, Jesus.
[2:00:41] In Bethlehem.
[2:00:43] OH, THAT'S THE WAY IT DOES ALL OF US.
[2:00:45] FROM A HOUSE OF UNBELIEF AND A HOUSE OF
[2:00:48] FRUSTRATIONS AND IMMORAL ACTS AND
[2:00:50] EVERYTHING ELSE to a place to a position
[2:00:53] in Christ, which is most beautiful. It
[2:00:56] moved us from the ridiculous to the
[2:00:59] sublime. Amen. From the lowest. Oh,
[2:01:02] glory. Amen. It took you from the lowest
[2:01:04] of the lowest. Amen. TO THE PRINCIPAL
[2:01:07] AND THE BEST PLACES in the land. Amen.
[2:01:10] Before Rahab lived in the lowest of the
[2:01:12] lowest of the lowest. Amen. You had to
[2:01:14] look very low to even find Rahab. And
[2:01:17] then you had to look lower. Amen. But
[2:01:19] when God got done with Rahab, she went
[2:01:21] from the lowest of the lowest to the
[2:01:23] highest of the highest.
[2:01:26] Hallelujah.
[2:01:26] What are you saying, preacher? I'm
[2:01:28] preaching to some modern-day believers
[2:01:30] that was born in sin, shape, and
[2:01:33] iniquity. Come in the world speaking
[2:01:35] lies. We was on our way to hell. We was
[2:01:38] in the lowest of the lowest. But here we
[2:01:40] are this morning sitting at the
[2:01:42] banqueting table of the almighty God
[2:01:45] with a seven course feast, with the word
[2:01:48] open, with faith in our hearts, with
[2:01:50] grace over our lives, with the token
[2:01:52] over our home, with a scarlet cord. Come
[2:01:55] on, Rahab. It's time to rejoice. Amen.
[2:01:58] YOU AIN'T IN THE PROSTITUTE HOUSE NO
[2:02:00] MORE. YOU AIN'T IN the house of unbelief
[2:02:02] no more. You're in the house with the
[2:02:04] prince himself.
[2:02:05] Thank you, Lord.
[2:02:07] Hallelujah. Thank you, Jesus.
[2:02:11] Hallelujah.
[2:02:12] Hallelujah.
[2:02:14] Thank you, Jesus. Thank you, Lord.
[2:02:18] Thank you, Jesus.
[2:02:18] What are you saying, preacher?
[2:02:20] Hallelujah.
[2:02:22] Thank you, Lord. I'm saying when God
[2:02:23] gets done with something, it'll go from
[2:02:25] the ridiculous
[2:02:27] Hallelujah.
[2:02:29] Thank you, Lord.
[2:02:31] To the sublime.
[2:02:33] Thank you, Jesus.
[2:02:35] Thank you, Lord.
[2:02:37] I preached that bottle of oil out of
[2:02:38] this pullpit 100 times this weekend.
[2:02:43] Come on.
[2:02:44] Hold that.
[2:02:50] Thank you, Lord.
[2:02:52] What does from the ridiculous to the
[2:02:53] sublime mean?
[2:02:56] Preach.
[2:02:57] It means from something silly,
[2:03:00] foolish.
[2:03:01] Yeah.
[2:03:02] Or absurd.
[2:03:03] Come on.
[2:03:04] To something exceptional
[2:03:06] or beautiful.
[2:03:09] Thank you, Lord.
[2:03:12] Thank you, Jesus.
[2:03:15] [Applause]
[2:03:16] Do you realize what it's less common to
[2:03:18] do? It's less common to go from the
[2:03:22] sublime to the ridiculous.
[2:03:25] An example was I was pleasantly
[2:03:29] surprised by the ending to that play.
[2:03:35] Come on.
[2:03:36] It really took things from the
[2:03:40] ridiculous
[2:03:44] to the sublime.
[2:03:46] Thank you, Lord.
[2:03:49] Thank you, Jesus.
[2:03:50] Now, this is going to be a real simple
[2:03:51] drama, okay?
[2:03:54] John's got a horse. John's got a gun.
[2:03:58] John's going to go ride.
[2:04:01] Something happens in the beginning
[2:04:05] that causes you to think
[2:04:07] John's going to get robbed. John's going
[2:04:09] to get shot. Horse is going to get
[2:04:11] killed. And the robber is going to get
[2:04:13] away.
[2:04:16] Right now he's in the sublime, but
[2:04:19] you're thinking by the end something's
[2:04:20] going to happen make it look ridiculous.
[2:04:25] But that's your finite mind.
[2:04:28] You didn't write the play.
[2:04:30] Hallelujah.
[2:04:31] Thank you, Lord.
[2:04:34] You didn't write the setting.
[2:04:37] You didn't write the middle part.
[2:04:39] You didn't write the end.
[2:04:41] YOU DIDN'T KNOW THE CHARACTERS. YOU
[2:04:43] DIDN'T KNOW THE PLOT. YOU DIDN'T KNOW
[2:04:45] THE moral to the story. ALL YOU SAW WAS
[2:04:48] WHAT YOUR FINITE MIND WOULD LET you see.
[2:04:50] Amen. But a director,
[2:04:52] hallelujah.
[2:04:54] A director could look OVER THE ENTIRE
[2:04:56] SKIT AND SAY, "JOHN'S got a gun and
[2:04:59] John's GOT A HORSE AND THERE'S A ROBBER
[2:05:01] HALFWAY THROUGH, but by the end of the
[2:05:03] story, Amen, the robber's going to be
[2:05:05] dead and John's going to have everything
[2:05:07] back the robber took from him."
[2:05:09] Hallelujah.
[2:05:11] Thank you, Lord.
[2:05:12] HE'S GOING TO HAVE BACK EVERYTHING THAT
[2:05:14] WAS TAKEN FROM. YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENED?
[2:05:16] AMEN. SOMEBODY WITH AN INFINITE MIND.
[2:05:19] AMEN. Saw the end from the beginning and
[2:05:21] said, "This is how it's going to end."
[2:05:23] Amen. Can I close these meetings out by
[2:05:25] saying this? Your end is not going to be
[2:05:28] any different than the way God saw it.
[2:05:33] Come on, Rahab. Come on, Boaz. Come on,
[2:05:36] Ruth. Come on, Shamon. Come on, Oed. I
[2:05:39] ain't got time to preach all those all
[2:05:40] those Bethlehem dwellers. AMEN. COME ON.
[2:05:43] They everyone had a beginning THAT
[2:05:45] DIDN'T LOOK LIKE THE END THEY WAS GOING
[2:05:47] TO HAVE. BUT GOD was working A MIGHTY
[2:05:50] MYSTERY SIGN. AMEN. Oh God,
[2:05:53] can I make the connections here? Amen.
[2:05:55] If I mess up, you forgive me, okay? But
[2:05:57] it started with Ruth or with Rahab and
[2:05:59] it went to Simmon,
[2:06:01] right? Went from there. Amen. Into Boaz.
[2:06:04] Amen. Into Ruth, into Oed. into Jesse
[2:06:08] into David. Are y'all hearing me? Amen.
[2:06:10] Bam said working up to one great head
[2:06:12] which what was that head? Amen. David.
[2:06:15] But the head was the greater son which
[2:06:18] was Jesus Christ. Are y'all hearing me?
[2:06:22] How did the building start with a
[2:06:25] Harvey? How did the lineage start? It
[2:06:28] started with a harlot.
[2:06:32] What does THAT TELL ME? THAT TELLS ME IT
[2:06:35] DON'T MATTER WHERE you begin, where you
[2:06:37] end up.
[2:06:41] That there, I feel liberty coming over
[2:06:43] the mind of somebody right now. I feel
[2:06:45] liberty coming over the heart of
[2:06:46] somebody. Your mistakes has been stacked
[2:06:49] up against you. Your failures HAS BEEN
[2:06:51] STACKED UP AGAINST YOU. Your mama said
[2:06:53] you wouldn't succeed. And your daddy
[2:06:55] said you'd be a failure. And your
[2:06:57] brothers and sisters went on to be
[2:06:58] successful. And you don't look like you
[2:07:00] did much in life. Amen. But let me tell
[2:07:02] you something, Bethlehem. When God gets
[2:07:05] done with you, he'll raise up the savior
[2:07:07] of the world. When God gets done with
[2:07:09] you, he'll raise up a healer. He'll
[2:07:11] raise up a kinsman redeemer. He'll raise
[2:07:14] up Jehovah. Oh, come on, church. What
[2:07:16] are YOU SAYING, PREACHER? I'M SAYING
[2:07:18] don't underestimate the power of the
[2:07:21] living God.
[2:07:22] Thank you, Lord.
[2:07:25] Thank you, Jesus.
[2:07:27] Are y'all hearing me?
[2:07:29] look like a bunch of losers. But when
[2:07:31] God got done, there was a bunch of
[2:07:33] winners.
[2:07:34] [Music]
[2:07:35] Look like a bunch of nobodies. Amen. But
[2:07:37] when God got done, Amen. You know what
[2:07:40] he done? He took some weak instruments
[2:07:42] and played some mighty strong songs.
[2:07:44] Hallelujah.
[2:07:46] Thank you, Lord.
[2:07:48] Brother David, I'm feeling a little
[2:07:49] dangerous right now. Amen. When God got
[2:07:52] done with those instruments, they was
[2:07:53] out of tune. They was all warped. The
[2:07:56] strings were broken. They were so
[2:07:59] THEY THEY COULDN'T EVEN play nothing.
[2:08:00] Amen. BUT WHEN GOD GOT DONE with them,
[2:08:03] YOU KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT, DON'T
[2:08:05] YOU? I'M TALKING ABOUT THAT violin that
[2:08:07] was out there on the auction block.
[2:08:08] Remember? Amen. The father of God said,
[2:08:10] "Somebody come by and looked at it and
[2:08:12] they said, "It's worthless. Has no
[2:08:14] value. It means nothing to nobody. We
[2:08:16] might as well throw it away." Amen. But
[2:08:18] then a musician come by. Oh.
[2:08:22] Oh, God. THEN A MUSICIAN COME BY. AND
[2:08:25] what did a musician do? Amen. You know
[2:08:27] why they said it had no value, BROTHER
[2:08:29] HARVEY? BECAUSE OF WHOSE hands it was
[2:08:31] in. Because of whose hands? Hallelujah.
[2:08:36] [Applause]
[2:08:38] Because of whose hands was holding it.
[2:08:40] They said it had no value. You know
[2:08:43] what? A musician se Amen. A NON-M
[2:08:45] MUSICIAN SEES NO VALUE IN an instrument.
[2:08:48] Amen. A non-m musician, Amen, sees no
[2:08:51] glory. They see no future. THEY HEAR NO
[2:08:53] SOUND. AMEN. BUT a musician knows,
[2:08:58] a musician knows if I just tune it up,
[2:09:03] IF I JUST RISEN UP THE BOW, if I just
[2:09:06] put a tuner on it and I begin to pluck a
[2:09:09] cord and I get it all in tune, it may
[2:09:11] have some scars.
[2:09:16] It may have some wounds. It may HAVE
[2:09:18] SOME SCARS. BUT WHEN I GET DONE WITH IT,
[2:09:21] IT'LL be the most valuable thing on the
[2:09:23] entire auction block.
[2:09:27] Are y'all hearing me? It went from being
[2:09:29] $2, Amen. to being the most valuable
[2:09:32] thing THAT WAS BROUGHT IN THAT AUCTION
[2:09:34] that day. You know what changed it?
[2:09:36] Whose hands it got in?
[2:09:39] Somebody say that with me. Whose hands
[2:09:42] it got in? Who got a hold of it? Amen.
[2:09:45] Changed the outcome of it. Who touched
[2:09:47] it? Now, you know why I sang that?
[2:09:50] Somebody touch me. Amen. You know why?
[2:09:53] Amen. Because if a man touches you,
[2:09:55] he'll never reveal the full potential
[2:09:56] laying inside of you. Amen. BUT IF THE
[2:09:58] ALMIGHTY GOD, AMEN, EVER TOUCHES YOUR
[2:10:01] HEART ONE TIME AND BEGINS TO TUNE up
[2:10:03] your life and begins to tune up your
[2:10:05] things and begins to tune up your
[2:10:07] worship. Amen. The devil says there'll
[2:10:09] never be another song played out of that
[2:10:11] violin. And God says, "Stand back and
[2:10:13] watch." Hallelujah.
[2:10:17] It looks broken, but it's going to play
[2:10:19] again. It looks broken, but there's
[2:10:21] going to be some music play again. What
[2:10:23] are you saying, brother Andrew? I'm
[2:10:25] saying the devil said you was broken. He
[2:10:28] said your church was broken. He said
[2:10:30] your family was broken. He said your
[2:10:32] kids was broken and your nerves was
[2:10:34] broken and your mind was broken. Amen.
[2:10:36] BUT GOD SAID, "WHEN I GET done with Word
[2:10:38] of Life Tabernacle, they'll be playing
[2:10:40] out some music."
[2:10:43] The mystery. Amen. I'm going to retitle
[2:10:45] this sermon the mystery OF WORD OF LIFE
[2:10:48] TABERNACLE.
[2:10:50] Thank you, Lord Jesus.
[2:10:52] When I get done, THEY'LL BE SHOUTING THE
[2:10:54] AISLES. WHEN I GET DONE, they'll be
[2:10:57] running IN VICTORY. WHEN I GET DONE,
[2:10:59] I'LL RAISE them from the lowest up into
[2:11:02] the most PRINCIPLED PART. WHEN I GET
[2:11:03] DONE WITH MY young people, they're going
[2:11:05] to know that I am God. When I GET DONE
[2:11:07] WITH THAT BROKEN HEART, they're going to
[2:11:09] know I'm a healer.
[2:11:10] Hallelujah.
[2:11:12] Thank you, Lord.
[2:11:14] Thank you, Jesus.
[2:11:16] Thank you, Lord.
[2:11:17] Now, I I can't leave out a very
[2:11:18] important part about that valley. And
[2:11:21] you know what that part is?
[2:11:24] It was scarred.
[2:11:27] It was broken.
[2:11:29] It was out of tune.
[2:11:31] Come on, preach.
[2:11:33] It strings were wore down.
[2:11:35] Yeah.
[2:11:36] It was in a feeble condition.
[2:11:38] Yes, it was.
[2:11:40] Come on, preach.
[2:11:42] And here's what I love about it.
[2:11:44] Yeah.
[2:11:45] All that had to happen was had to change
[2:11:47] hands.
[2:11:51] Come on.
[2:11:52] Brother Brother David, do you realize
[2:11:54] when that master violinist picked it up,
[2:11:56] he didn't put the music in it.
[2:11:59] Come on, preach.
[2:12:01] Come on, preach.
[2:12:03] He didn't put the music in it. The music
[2:12:05] was already in it.
[2:12:08] Oh, God.
[2:12:10] The only thing he did was reveal inside
[2:12:15] of that violin what nobody else saw.
[2:12:18] OH GOD HELP ME, CHURCH. ARE Y'ALL
[2:12:21] HEARING ME? The only THING HE DIDN'T PUT
[2:12:24] HE DIDN'T PUT MUSIC in it. He brought
[2:12:27] the MUSIC OUT. AMEN. BURIED underneath
[2:12:29] those scars. Buried underneath those
[2:12:31] broken strings. Buried underneath those
[2:12:33] attitune cords. Amen. With some music.
[2:12:35] And he begin TO PLAY A GOSPEL SONG. Oh
[2:12:38] church, ARE Y'ALL HEARING ME? WHY THEN
[2:12:41] are you here today? YOU DIDN'T PUT THIS
[2:12:43] MESSAGE in your heart.
[2:12:46] THERE WAS A SEED ON THE INSIDE OF YOU
[2:12:49] FROM BEFORE the foundation of the world.
[2:12:52] And you saw no purpose in your life. You
[2:12:54] saw no value IN YOUR LIFE. AMEN. BECAUSE
[2:12:56] you was in the wrong hands. You was in
[2:12:59] the hands of what man thought about you
[2:13:00] and what the church thought about you
[2:13:02] and what so and so THOUGHT ABOUT YOU.
[2:13:04] BUT GOD SAID, "I'm going to get a hold
[2:13:06] of him.
[2:13:08] Thank you, Lord.
[2:13:09] I'm going to quicken a seed on the
[2:13:11] inside.
[2:13:14] Hallelujah.
[2:13:15] And out of that broken violin.
[2:13:18] Thank you, Lord.
[2:13:19] Thank you, Jesus.
[2:13:20] Is going to come a strong song.
[2:13:23] Jesus.
[2:13:25] Thank you, Lord.
[2:13:27] What are you saying, preacher?
[2:13:29] Thank you, Jesus.
[2:13:31] I'm saying Israel,
[2:13:33] thank you, Lord.
[2:13:34] Went from the chaos of Egypt,
[2:13:36] Hallelujah. which was the ridiculous
[2:13:38] to the promised land.
[2:13:41] Which was the sublime.
[2:13:43] Hallelujah.
[2:13:44] I'm saying what Paul said, if any man be
[2:13:46] in Christ,
[2:13:47] he is a new creature.
[2:13:49] Thank you, Lord.
[2:13:50] Old things are passed away
[2:13:53] and behold all things.
[2:13:55] Thank you, Lord.
[2:13:56] Thank you, Jesus.
[2:13:58] Or become new.
[2:13:59] Hallelujah.
[2:14:01] Thank you, Jesus.
[2:14:05] We got any violins here today?
[2:14:08] Thank you, Lord Jesus.
[2:14:10] Have we got any violins here today?
[2:14:14] Hallelujah.
[2:14:15] Everybody was holding you in their hand
[2:14:17] and telling you they didn't have no
[2:14:18] value and didn't have no future.
[2:14:19] Thank you, Lord Jesus.
[2:14:21] Your music playing days was over.
[2:14:24] Thank you, Jesus.
[2:14:26] God said, "Stand back."
[2:14:29] Hallelujah.
[2:14:31] Thank you, Lord.
[2:14:32] Come on. Thank you, Jesus.
[2:14:34] Stand back.
[2:14:36] Thank you, Lord.
[2:14:37] I've got a track record.
[2:14:38] Hallelujah.
[2:14:40] Thank you, Jesus.
[2:14:41] Of taking out a tune instruments.
[2:14:43] Thank you, Lord.
[2:14:45] Playing mighty strong songs.
[2:14:48] Thank you, Lord.
[2:14:49] Brother Donnie Reagan told me one time
[2:14:51] years ago, he was going down to preach
[2:14:52] in South Carolina.
[2:14:55] Those of you that know Brother Donnie,
[2:14:56] you know, he's a a master woodworker. I
[2:14:58] mean, you can tell that he's preaching.
[2:15:02] He can take things and put things
[2:15:03] together and build build. I mean, it's
[2:15:05] amazing to see what he can do. They told
[2:15:07] me he said, "I was going down preaching,
[2:15:08] brother Fred.
[2:15:11] I'll be honest with you. I
[2:15:14] Oh, God.
[2:15:16] I'm traveling a little bit, preaching
[2:15:17] different meetings." Brother Donnie,
[2:15:18] there's one thing about it. Sometimes
[2:15:20] you realize early in the morning, he'll
[2:15:22] disappear like gone. Like, we was out in
[2:15:27] Virginia one morning. I was down there
[2:15:28] eating breakfast. I said, "Anybody seen
[2:15:30] brother Donnie?" And they said, "Yeah,
[2:15:30] we saw him leave here about 6:00 this
[2:15:32] morning." I said, "Really?" He said,
[2:15:33] "Yeah." I said, "Do you go home?" He
[2:15:35] said, "No, he's going antique shopping."
[2:15:39] Brother Kn, he said, "I like to go to
[2:15:40] antique shops." He said, "I've got
[2:15:41] like," he said, "I've actually got ones
[2:15:43] picked out different spots."
[2:15:45] He said, "Like when I go to South
[2:15:46] Carolina." He said, "I go through this
[2:15:47] one." He said, "I went in there one day
[2:15:49] and he said, they had this they had this
[2:15:51] great old big piece of piece of of
[2:15:53] furniture there." He said, "It was
[2:15:54] beautiful wood." He said, "I looked at I
[2:15:56] thought, man, I want to take that home."
[2:15:58] He said, "So I started talking to the
[2:16:00] guy and he asked me what he said, 'What
[2:16:02] do you want me to give me for it?" And
[2:16:02] he said, 'Well, I told him, he said,
[2:16:03] 'Well, I ain't taking that for it. He
[2:16:04] said, "Brother," I said, "Well, then
[2:16:05] I'll just leave it. You know, you can
[2:16:07] have it." He said, "Okay." He said,
[2:16:08] 'Well, thank you. He said, "Thanks for
[2:16:10] stopping by, brother." I said, "Yeah."
[2:16:11] He said, "But I really wanted that."
[2:16:15] He said, "Cuz I knew what kind of wood
[2:16:17] it was." He He said, "I knew the I mean,
[2:16:19] I'm telling you, the guy tell you the
[2:16:20] grain and everything of it." So, he
[2:16:23] said, "We went on down, preached the
[2:16:24] meet and come back home." Next year, we
[2:16:25] went back down to that meeting and he
[2:16:26] said, "We stopped by there again." in.
[2:16:28] He said, "I went in." The guy said,
[2:16:28] "I've been looking for you."
[2:16:32] He said, "What do you mean?" He said,
[2:16:33] "Well," he said, "You was in here last
[2:16:34] year and you looked at this this piece
[2:16:36] of wood here, this this piece of
[2:16:38] furniture." And he said, "I didn't want
[2:16:39] to I didn't want to sell it for what you
[2:16:40] want to give me for it." He said, "But
[2:16:42] something actually happened." He said,
[2:16:43] he said, "Something happened and the
[2:16:44] thing got knocked over."
[2:16:47] And he said, "It got broken. It
[2:16:48] shattered." He said, "Now, if you want
[2:16:51] it, it's out back."
[2:16:55] Oh, God. Woo Jesus.
[2:16:59] Hallelujah.
[2:17:01] [Applause]
[2:17:03] Brother Paul, if you want out back,
[2:17:07] he said, "I went back over there and he
[2:17:09] said, I looked at it." He said, "It was
[2:17:10] in about I can't remember how many apple
[2:17:12] boxes." He said, "It was shattered into
[2:17:14] th into into hundreds if not thousands
[2:17:16] of pieces, splintered, broken, busted,
[2:17:18] everything."
[2:17:20] He said, "I took it home in my truck,
[2:17:23] put it downstairs in my basement, and he
[2:17:25] said, "I go down there and I'd be
[2:17:26] listening to tapes, and I think," he
[2:17:28] said, "for long years."
[2:17:30] Thank you, Lord.
[2:17:32] He said, "For about two long years." He
[2:17:34] said, "I was down there." He said, "I'd
[2:17:36] get my sander out and I'd work a while."
[2:17:38] He said, "I'd get my nailer out." He
[2:17:40] said, "I'd sand, I'd glue, I'd cut," He
[2:17:42] said, "I'd work on it." He said, "While
[2:17:44] I was listening to tapes," he said, "I'd
[2:17:46] just be down there working." He turned
[2:17:47] his phone around and he said, "Now, here
[2:17:49] it is."
[2:17:51] I wish I could put the picture of it up
[2:17:53] here before you.
[2:17:56] He said, "It looks better now."
[2:17:59] Hallelujah.
[2:18:02] Than it did before,
[2:18:05] but what changed it? IT TOOK A FALL. IT
[2:18:08] TOOK A BREAKING. BUT IT TOOK A MASTER
[2:18:11] WOODWORKER TO PICK IT up and to begin to
[2:18:14] glue AND TO BEGIN TO SAW AND TO BEGIN TO
[2:18:17] SAND. AND YOU KNOW WHAT? IT STANDS IN
[2:18:20] HIS HOUSE TODAY AS A RECOGNITION. IT
[2:18:23] DON'T MATTER HOW BROKEN YOU ARE. IF GOD
[2:18:26] EVER GETS A HOLD OF YOU IN TWO YEARS, in
[2:18:29] 3 years, IN FIVE MINUTES, BETHLEHEM,
[2:18:32] HE'LL STAND YOU UP AS A TROPHY THAT
[2:18:35] NOTHING IS TOO BROKEN FOR GOD.
[2:18:38] HALLELUJAH.
[2:18:40] OH, brother Andrew, I don't see WHAT YOU
[2:18:42] SEE. THAT'S YOUR FINITE MIND. AMEN. BUT
[2:18:45] BROTHER DONNIE DIDN'T HAVE A finite mind
[2:18:47] when it come to that piece of wood. He
[2:18:49] had an infinite mind. He could see what
[2:18:51] he was going to do. He could see what it
[2:18:53] would LOOK LIKE. AND THERE WAS NO
[2:18:55] DISCOURAGEMENT. I THINK I ASKED HIM, and
[2:18:56] I hope he don't mind me sharing this. I
[2:18:58] asked him, "Brother Donnie, how many
[2:19:00] days did it look like it wasn't going to
[2:19:01] come together?" He said, "Many times."
[2:19:03] But I kept on working because I knew
[2:19:05] what wood was capable of doing.
[2:19:08] [Music]
[2:19:09] OH,
[2:19:11] I'M PREACHING to you now. Word of life.
[2:19:13] I'M PREACHING TO YOU NOW, CHURCH. AMEN.
[2:19:15] But I kept on working because I knew
[2:19:18] there was some potentials in that wood.
[2:19:20] Amen. Brother Ben, KEEP ON PREACHING. I
[2:19:22] KNOW THERE'S SOME POTENTIALS in these
[2:19:24] eagles. Eagles, keep on coming to
[2:19:27] church. THERE'S SOME POTENTIALS IN THIS
[2:19:29] MESSAGE. THERE'S SOME POTENTIALS IN THIS
[2:19:31] CHURCH. It may look like you're broken.
[2:19:34] Hallelujah.
[2:19:36] Hallelujah.
[2:19:38] Thank you, Jesus.
[2:19:40] Thank you, Lord.
[2:19:41] Oh, we love you.
[2:19:42] But when God gets done with you,
[2:19:45] thank you, Lord Jesus.
[2:19:48] Thank you, Lord.
[2:19:49] I said, "Brother Donnie, what'd you do
[2:19:50] with that?"
[2:19:50] Oh, hallelujah.
[2:19:52] Thank you, Jesus.
[2:19:53] He said, "I put it in my living room."
[2:19:55] Thank you, Lord.
[2:19:57] He said, "Originally, it's supposed to
[2:19:58] be an entertainment center,
[2:20:00] and we ain't got no television.
[2:20:04] Thank you,
[2:20:05] but it still stands there. Hallelujah.
[2:20:08] Believe he said it's in his living room
[2:20:09] somewhere.
[2:20:10] Thank you, Lord.
[2:20:10] But it stands there for everybody to
[2:20:12] see. It comes through.
[2:20:15] Thank you, Jesus.
[2:20:17] Brother Andrew, what are you saying?

[2:20:26] Thank you, Lord.
[2:20:27] Don't get discouraged in those two
[2:20:28] years.
[2:20:31] Thank you, Lord Jesus. Don't lose your
[2:20:33] temper and bust all the wood and put it
[2:20:34] back in the apple box and say, "This is
[2:20:36] a waste of time."
[2:20:38] Thank you, Lord.
[2:20:40] Thank you, Lord Jesus.
[2:20:42] Hallelujah.

[2:20:54] Gets a little hard, don't it?
[2:20:55] Thank you, Lord.
[2:20:59] But just keep on coming.

[2:22:09] Dreams may have to shatter.
[2:22:12] Oh, God.
[2:22:15] I'm not a crazy man.
[2:22:18] Three minutes before I walked out that
[2:22:19] door, God totally told me to preach the
[2:22:21] mystery of Bethlehem.
[2:22:22] Hallelujah.
[2:22:23] I was preaching on God hidden
[2:22:24] simplicity.
[2:22:27] And God took me to that sermon right
[2:22:28] there and said, "Preach it."
[2:22:30] Thank you, Lord Jesus.
[2:22:32] Right there in that room.
[2:22:35] Hallelujah.
[2:22:37] This significant now,
[2:22:39] but don't worry. When God gets done,
[2:22:44] everybody that talked about you'll have
[2:22:45] to talk for you.
[2:22:48] Thank you, Lord.

[2:24:12] there.

[2:24:20] When God gets

[2:24:38] Just come home.
[2:24:47] days.
[2:24:51] When you want to throw up your hands and
[2:24:52] quit,
[2:24:55] thank you, Jesus,
[2:25:00] but just keep on praising God.
[2:25:03] Thank you, Lord.
[2:25:06] Brother Allan,
[2:25:10] keep on preaching.
[2:25:12] Thank you, Lord Jesus.
[2:25:14] Thank you, Lord Jesus.
[2:25:15] Preach with everything that's within
[2:25:17] you.
[2:25:17] Thank you, Lord.
[2:25:19] It's the hour to do it.
[2:25:22] Thank you, Lord Jesus.
[2:25:25] And I'm just I'm I may be thinking a
[2:25:26] little bit deeper in the story right now
[2:25:28] than
[2:25:29] But you know what? Sometimes I wonder
[2:25:31] when I when I sit there and thought
[2:25:32] about that. I wondered if there was
[2:25:34] times
[2:25:36] that Brother Donnie would be working on
[2:25:37] that piece of furniture
[2:25:40] and he would say, now he didn't tell me
[2:25:42] this, but I just wondered just just
[2:25:43] Andrew Glover thinking,
[2:25:46] "Boy, it don't look like I'm getting a
[2:25:47] lot done today, does it?"
[2:25:50] [Music]
[2:25:52] And then I wondered if there was days it
[2:25:54] looked like
[2:25:56] in just a few in just a few more short
[2:25:58] days it's going to be all together and
[2:25:59] it's going to be it's going to be it's
[2:26:01] going to be ready to present
[2:26:04] but then maybe two days or three days
[2:26:06] later he come back and run into a to
[2:26:08] another challenge.
[2:26:12] But if God said, "I will present it
[2:26:15] a spotless."
[2:26:16] Thank you, Lord.
[2:26:17] Glorious.
[2:26:19] Hallelujah.
[2:26:20] Chosen.
[2:26:20] Thank you, Lord.
[2:26:22] Without wrinkle,
[2:26:24] without blemish,
[2:26:26] bright.
[2:26:28] Hallelujah.
[2:26:29] Maybe some corners to turn.
[2:26:31] Yes.
[2:26:31] Some hills to climb.
[2:26:34] Thank you, Lord.
[2:26:35] But keep on preaching.
[2:26:38] Thank you, Lord.
[2:26:38] There's going to be a bride.
[2:26:40] Yes.
[2:26:41] Thank you, Jesus.
[2:26:42] You love him this morning.
[2:26:47] Thank you, Jesus.
[2:26:51] Good morning, Bethlehem dwellers.
[2:26:55] Thank you, Jesus.
[2:26:55] You've been born
[2:26:58] in God's Bethlehem.
[2:27:01] Today,
[2:27:04] [Music]
[2:27:06] I got to quit, but there's just an
[2:27:08] inspiration flowing right now.
[2:27:11] I've often wondered, brother,
[2:27:13] [Music]
[2:27:15] why was there such a fight
[2:27:17] in David like there was
[2:27:21] I've often wondered that. Why was there
[2:27:24] such a Why was there such a courage when
[2:27:26] that bear come in to say, "I'll take it
[2:27:29] out."
[2:27:32] Why was there a courage when that lion
[2:27:33] come in to say, "I'll take you out,
[2:27:35] too."
[2:27:36] Thank you, Lord.
[2:27:39] for a long time and and it's partly the
[2:27:40] reason building up to Goliath.
[2:27:46] But can I tell you another reason?
[2:27:48] David had to fight through all the
[2:27:50] village of Bethlehem being called
[2:27:51] losers.
[2:27:54] There was a fight in them Bethlehem
[2:27:55] dwellers like there was in nobody else.
[2:27:59] Thank you, Lord.
[2:28:00] That's why when Goliath stood there and
[2:28:02] said, "I'll take you down." David said,
[2:28:03] "Ah, that's what they told me in the
[2:28:04] city I was born in."
[2:28:07] Hallelujah.
[2:28:08] Thank you, Lord.
[2:28:10] [Music]
[2:28:13] I'll destroy you, David. THAT'S WHAT
[2:28:16] WELL, TODAY, DAVID, I'LL TAKE your I'll
[2:28:18] take you and show you to the world.
[2:28:22] I'll hang you up on my spear as a loser.
[2:28:25] David just chuckled and said, "That's
[2:28:26] what my own hometown said about me. I
[2:28:28] was a loser."
[2:28:30] [Music]
[2:28:34] Hallelujah.
[2:28:35] But I'm here today.
[2:28:37] Yes.
[2:28:38] Does everybody just want to close your
[2:28:39] eyes and just break into a moment of
[2:28:41] worship with the Lord?
[2:28:44] Is there anybody just want to say,
[2:28:46] "Thank you, Lord, for being on my side."
[2:28:49] Is there anybody just want to just want
[2:28:51] to say, "Thank you, Lord." When the odds
[2:28:52] was stacked against me,
[2:28:55] thank you, Lord.
[2:28:56] You was on my side.
[2:28:58] Thank you, Lord.
[2:28:59] I was I was that wood laying out there
[2:29:01] in the back of those apple boxes.
[2:29:03] Thank you, Jesus. I was that vine lid
[2:29:05] that was out of tune and wasn't worth
[2:29:08] much.
[2:29:09] But God rich in mercy.
[2:29:12] Thank you, Lord.
[2:29:13] God rich in mercy picked me up.
[2:29:15] Hallelujah.
[2:29:16] Turn me around.
[2:29:18] Oh, God
[2:29:20] took me back to the m to the wood shop
[2:29:22] and laid me on a pew on a Wednesday
[2:29:24] night and
[2:29:26] God sent a preacher in the pull pit with
[2:29:28] a vision for my life. I couldn't see it.
[2:29:31] I was getting really tired of getting
[2:29:33] preached that all the time. I I was
[2:29:35] getting really tired of hearing all that
[2:29:36] over and over and over. I was ready to
[2:29:38] throw up my hands and quit. But about
[2:29:40] that time, he got that groove right back
[2:29:41] in that other groove and he got that
[2:29:44] clamp and he clamped down on it and he
[2:29:46] put that glue in there and he put that
[2:29:47] nail in there and he clamped it down
[2:29:49] real tight and the devil said it was
[2:29:51] going to fall apart. Oh, but God rich in
[2:29:54] mercy said it's a part of the super
[2:29:56] structure. It's a part of the
[2:29:58] foundation. Is there any Bethlehem
[2:29:59] dwellers here tonight that just wants to
[2:30:01] say, "Thank you, God.
[2:30:03] Thank you for being on my side. Thank
[2:30:05] you for setting me free from this finite
[2:30:08] way of thinking. It's grounded me long
[2:30:10] enough. It's grounded my vision. It's
[2:30:12] grounded my direction. It's grounded my
[2:30:15] family. I I'm Today, Lord, I'm throwing
[2:30:17] away the old spirit of jealousy. I'm
[2:30:20] throwing away the old spirit of
[2:30:21] criticalness. I'm throwing away the old
[2:30:23] thoughts of of well so and so done this
[2:30:25] and sister done this and brother didn't
[2:30:27] shake my head and and if I if they sung
[2:30:29] as me oh if they did that oh get rid of
[2:30:32] it today Bethlehem dwellers you got a
[2:30:34] greater potential you got a greater
[2:30:36] vision than just coming to church and

[2:30:40] sung and and who didn't let you do this
[2:30:41] and who didn't recognize oh lay that
[2:30:43] aside Bethlehem dwellers there's a fight
[2:30:46] inside of you got a finish line to cross

[2:30:51] achievement of God in this generation.

[2:30:57] Lord, we bow our hearts in your presence
[2:30:59] this morning.
[2:31:01] Thank you, Jesus.
[2:31:03] Father,
[2:31:05] I am not ashamed to testify.
[2:31:08] I felt your grace
[2:31:11] settle over the hearts of this assembly.
[2:31:17] Thank you, Lord Jesus. Lord, I believe
[2:31:19] that not because I was here
[2:31:22] or any other preacher was here,
[2:31:25] but I believe the accuracy of the Holy
[2:31:27] Ghost
[2:31:30] has guided
[2:31:32] a laser
[2:31:34] bomb
[2:31:36] right to the old devil.
[2:31:39] It says God is doing nothing
[2:31:42] and is Bethlehem today.

[2:31:47] broken hearts,

[2:33:17] there's a work there. There's a people
[2:33:20] to be brought up out of Bethlehem.
[2:33:23] You got to forget what the finite way of
