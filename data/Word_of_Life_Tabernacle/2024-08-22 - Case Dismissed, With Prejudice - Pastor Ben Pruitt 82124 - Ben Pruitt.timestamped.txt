[37:58] 42 I want to add my condolences to those
[38:02] that have already been expressed for the
[38:04] family of sister Jackson sister Carol
[38:06] was always kind to to me and my wife and
[38:10] I cter brother Truman as a friend and
[38:13] and uh he was just a fixture here at the
[38:15] church for so many years and uh so I'm
[38:19] sure that'll be a great loss to them and
[38:21] especially to Sister Vicky and brother
[38:24] Glenn and the family I want to say we're
[38:26] pulling for you and pray and for you and
[38:28] believing the Lord will just comfort you
[38:31] in the time of loss and we'll let you
[38:33] know just as soon as we hear about
[38:35] arrangements for sister Carol I always
[38:38] want to honor those who have worked in
[38:39] the church because every person that's
[38:42] been a part of the church over the years
[38:44] has made uh made up the fabric of what
[38:47] the church is today and I believe
[38:49] thinking back at times when brother
[38:51] trumman was here and sister Carol it uh
[38:54] really makes me think that that uh that
[38:57] still lives on that Legacy lives on and
[39:00] and they were hospitable to us and we
[39:02] always want to be to other people and
[39:04] treat them right and I believe there
[39:06] will be a reward for that sister
[39:08] Jackson's in a better place tonight and
[39:10] we're just believing that we're all
[39:11] going to be there one of these days
[39:13] we're trusting that amen let's go back
[39:16] to Acts chapter 10 verse
[39:19] 42 this is Peter speaking to those in
[39:22] cornelius's house says he commanded us
[39:25] to preach unto the people notice what it
[39:27] says and to testify that it is he which
[39:31] was ordained of God to be the judge of
[39:34] quick that's alive and dead to him give
[39:39] all the prophets witness that through
[39:41] his name whosoever believeth in him
[39:44] shall receive remission of sins and
[39:48] while Peter yet spake these words the
[39:51] Holy Ghost fell on all them which heard
[39:54] the word I pray that would be the case
[39:55] tonight the word is being preached
[39:57] preached you may have your seats God
[39:59] bless you
[40:01] tonight I want to speak to you tonight
[40:04] on case
[40:05] dismissed with prejudice case
[40:09] dismissed with prejudice Prejudice in
[40:12] criminal law is not the same as uh being
[40:15] racist or something like that but it
[40:18] actually means a final decision that's
[40:20] not subject to Future inquiry a final
[40:24] decision that's not subject to future
[40:28] inquiry if the judge announces a case is
[40:31] dismissed but then he says with
[40:33] prejudice it means it can never be
[40:36] brought again and I believe tonight just
[40:39] to say it up FR that our sins have been
[40:42] dismissed that the case against us has
[40:45] been dismissed with prejudice in other
[40:47] words it can never be brought back again
[40:51] it's put in the sea of his forgetfulness
[40:54] and it can never be fished out again and
[40:57] and what it means in criminal law is
[40:59] that is that the prosecutor must make an
[41:01] extremely strong case uh against the
[41:05] person that he is accusing before it can
[41:08] be brought so they'll go and search out
[41:10] everything and make sure that they know
[41:12] exactly what the person did and they'll
[41:15] go out and and uh and tie up get all
[41:17] kinds of witnesses and all kinds of
[41:19] material evidence because they want to
[41:21] make sure there's no reasonable doubt
[41:23] they have to prove Beyond a reasonable
[41:26] doubt that this person did what they
[41:28] said that they would do or what they
[41:30] said that they did in order for them to
[41:32] be convicted because it would be better
[41:34] for one uh for for uh uh all of the
[41:37] guilty to go free than for one innocent
[41:39] person to be found guilty and so and
[41:43] because of that they have to make a very
[41:44] strong case and I want to tell you
[41:46] tonight that the case against us was a
[41:50] strong
[41:52] case right it was not a weak
[41:55] case the the we we started sinning at
[41:58] the moment that we
[42:00] could if that if that makes sense right
[42:03] you say when when did you start sinning
[42:04] brother Ben the minute I could the
[42:07] minute I could make a decision to do
[42:09] wrong I did wrong the minute you could
[42:11] make a decision I know we all want to be
[42:13] Angels tonight and get little Halos and
[42:15] put over our heads but but we the minute
[42:18] we could make a wrong decision we made a
[42:20] wrong decision someone said well I
[42:23] always looked for God no you didn't look
[42:24] for God you were looking to do
[42:26] everything wrong I I am I was where I
[42:28] was by my free will but it was his grace
[42:31] that called me out of where I was and
[42:33] made me a
[42:35] Christian the case against us was strong
[42:38] when when Eve listened to Satan's lie
[42:41] and Adam went with her every child born
[42:45] after that was Guilty By Nature by
[42:49] nature and we all proved it as we grew
[42:52] up because as soon as we could we sinned
[42:57] and so and this is why Abel had to offer
[42:59] a blood
[43:01] sacrifice even though he was the right
[43:03] seed line he was the elect of God but
[43:06] yet he had to offer a blood sacrifice
[43:10] because of the fact even though the
[43:12] blood had not yet been mixed but because
[43:14] of the fact that he uh he when he come
[43:18] into the world because he come even with
[43:20] Adam and Eve under that relationship but
[43:23] it was wrong and so he had to offer a
[43:25] blood sacrifice because it was blood in
[43:26] the beginning and so every man born
[43:29] between a man and a woman no matter how
[43:30] good the man and woman is every person
[43:33] born between a man and a woman is a
[43:35] sinner the Bible tells us that the
[43:37] wicked are estranged from the womb in
[43:40] other words they they're separated from
[43:42] God from the womb they go astray as soon
[43:46] as they be born speaking lies you say
[43:49] well that's the wicked well here's what
[43:50] David a man after God's Own Heart said
[43:52] he said behold I was shapen in iniquity
[43:56] in sin did my mother conceive me he said
[44:00] well I don't know I'm you know David
[44:02] Fell and he he did some things that were
[44:05] wrong maybe I wouldn't be quite that way
[44:06] but the Bible says all someone say all
[44:10] all have sinned and come short of the
[44:12] glory of God I think all fits most of
[44:16] us so we must come to
[44:19] Perfection we we believe that we must
[44:22] come to Perfection Paul tells us let it
[44:24] let us go on to Perfection and Jesus
[44:26] said be therefore perfect even as your
[44:28] father in Heaven is perfect we must come
[44:31] to Perfection we can't do that in
[44:34] ourselves we can't do that let me repeat
[44:37] that to you tonight I want you young
[44:39] people to understand this and I and I
[44:42] think some of us Elders you might say
[44:43] brother Ben this is pretty simplistic
[44:45] but I think it's important because we
[44:48] need to understand that we can't do that
[44:50] ourselves it must be a supernatural work
[44:53] of God in our life but the B said you
[44:55] legalist how could you ever perfect
[44:58] yourself when you have not one thing to
[45:00] perfect yourself with where would you
[45:03] find the building blocks of
[45:06] righteousness where would you find the
[45:08] ability to do the word of God to perform
[45:10] the word of God you don't have it
[45:12] there's no way you could do it only by
[45:14] the leadership of the Holy Ghost now he
[45:16] said you were born in sin your very
[45:19] conception was in sin the very desire of
[45:21] you being here with sin born in sin
[45:23] shaped in iniquity come to the world
[45:25] speaking lies now where are you going to
[45:27] stand at where are you sinner that said
[45:30] I'll quit smoking and I'll go to
[45:32] heaven right that's good thing to quit
[45:35] smoking but that won't make you go to
[45:37] heaven you can wear a patch and do that
[45:40] you can't wear a patch to get into
[45:42] heaven right where where are you
[45:45] lukewarm mossback so-called Christian
[45:49] that goes around here with a long face
[45:50] and saying well I belong to the
[45:53] church he said you sinner that's right
[45:56] unless you're born of the spirit of God
[45:58] you're lost
[45:59] right he said that's true how you going
[46:01] to go to heaven you say I never lied in
[46:04] my life oh the darling it was just an
[46:06] angel to begin with he said that's a
[46:09] lie I know you kids are good kids but
[46:12] you weren't an angel you were a human
[46:14] being even Joel's kids are
[46:18] human huh even my kids are human even
[46:22] your kids are human beings and brother
[46:25] Brandon said if I never had an evil
[46:26] thought in my life if I never spoke a
[46:29] bad word in my life if I never looked at
[46:31] anything evil never thought anything
[46:34] evil do you know how remarkable that
[46:36] would be to be a person who never
[46:38] thought anything
[46:41] evil that'd be pretty remarkable
[46:43] wouldn't it you'd be a pretty good
[46:46] person if you'd never thought anything
[46:47] evil but you even if you had never had
[46:50] an evil thought now this is a Biblical
[46:53] principle if you never had an evil
[46:55] thought he said I'm just as Rank and
[46:57] black as the smudy walls of hell I'm a
[47:00] sinner on now I'm a sinner that's what
[47:04] Paul means when he says all have sinned
[47:08] and that debt had to be paid so that was
[47:11] the case against
[47:13] us but we don't want to dwell on that
[47:15] tonight because I think we can all just
[47:17] pretty much say we're
[47:18] guilty right but what's the case for us
[47:21] now you say well there is no case for
[47:23] The Sinner but that's actually not true
[47:26] when it comes to to the elect because
[47:28] our attorney is Jesus Christ the
[47:33] prosecutor is Satan and so if you could
[47:35] think of the Throne of God as a as a as
[47:38] a courtroom you'd find that the the
[47:41] judge is there and the prosecutor and
[47:43] the attorney and the attorney is Jesus
[47:46] Christ and the uh prosecutor is Satan
[47:49] now in our attorney has alleged
[47:52] misconduct on the part of the
[47:54] prosecutor do you know that he has
[47:57] alleged that the prosecutor has has been
[48:01] involved in
[48:04] Entrapment right you know what that is
[48:05] it's when the law the law cannot go out
[48:08] of their way to make you do something
[48:10] illegal so that they can then trap you
[48:12] in that so he says that's what this this
[48:15] prosecutor has done look at Revelation
[48:18] CH 12 Revelation 12:7 it says there was
[48:21] war in heaven Michael and his angels
[48:24] fought against the dragon and the dragon
[48:26] fought and his angels and prevailed not
[48:29] oh I love that you know we might lose
[48:32] our loved one to cancer but the dragon
[48:33] did not Prevail in the end he was cast
[48:36] out you might you might have a temporary
[48:39] falling or failing you might temporarily
[48:42] lose a battle but in the end we win the
[48:45] war aren't you glad of that prevailed
[48:48] not neither was their place found
[48:49] anymore in heaven and the Great Dragon
[48:51] was cast out that old serpent called the
[48:53] devil and Satan which deceiveth the
[48:56] whole world he was cast out on the earth
[48:58] and his angels were cast out with him
[49:00] now notice if if our attorney was making
[49:02] a case he would say now there's been a
[49:05] case of entrapment and the thing is that
[49:07] this attorney this prosecuting attorney
[49:10] has disguised himself in many different
[49:12] ways but if you go back to that ninth
[49:14] verse look what he says he said that
[49:16] great Dragon was cast out so he was he
[49:20] was in the form of a great Dragon he was
[49:22] that old
[49:23] serpent what serpent the one that talked
[49:26] to Eve yeah right called the devil yeah
[49:29] right now look how many ways he
[49:30] identifies him and Satan which deceiveth
[49:33] the whole world so he identifies him in
[49:37] in four or five different ways and says
[49:40] I want you to understand that he's all
[49:42] the same person and there's a reason for
[49:45] that because if he's the same person
[49:48] that did the deceiving what's he doing
[49:50] here in the courtroom doing the
[49:53] accusing
[49:55] right right how can you be here how can
[49:57] you stand here devil and accuse God's
[50:00] Children of doing something wrong when
[50:02] you were the one that trapped them into
[50:04] doing something wrong in the first place
[50:07] so the prosecutor I'm going somewhere
[50:10] with this tonight the prosecutor is
[50:11] alleging that or the the defendant is
[50:14] alleging our attorney is alleging that
[50:16] the prosecutor mishandled the
[50:19] case oh my now now look and he said so
[50:24] this great Dragon the devil the serpent
[50:26] Satan and his angels were cast out with
[50:29] him in verse 10 says I heard a loud
[50:31] voice saying in heaven now has come
[50:33] salvation and strength and the kingdom
[50:35] of our God and the power of His Christ
[50:38] for the accuser sir now there's another
[50:41] name so who is the accuser of the
[50:43] Brethren the same one come on who got
[50:47] Eve in trouble yes the same one who got
[50:51] you in
[50:52] trouble right the same one who convinced
[50:55] you someone said the devil make you rob
[50:57] the store and then and then call the
[50:59] police on
[51:00] you right and the same one that
[51:02] convinced Satan or the convinced you to
[51:05] do wrong the same one who who pulled you
[51:08] and and made you what you were the same
[51:10] one who caused Eve to fall is the same
[51:13] one who is the accuser of the Brethren
[51:15] now that's that's important which
[51:16] accused them before our God day and
[51:19] night this is the same guy who deceived
[51:21] the third of the angels in heaven who is
[51:24] deceived and disrupted human race ever
[51:27] since but one day he got a hold of a man
[51:31] that had a little bit more about him
[51:32] than even Moses or Adam or any of those
[51:35] men did but he got a hold of someone
[51:38] named Jesus Christ our attorney and he
[51:41] did not deceive our
[51:43] attorney are you with me now I know it's
[51:46] simple but it's just what's on my heart
[51:48] tonight he did not deceive our attorney
[51:51] what did he do he said it's also written
[51:54] because our attorney knew the law he was
[51:56] the law
[51:57] he was the prophets he knew the law but
[51:59] he said it's also
[52:01] written he did not deceive I'm so glad
[52:05] of that tonight he did not deceive our
[52:08] attorney but he overcame him by the word
[52:11] the same way that you and I can tonight
[52:14] and so and so our attorney begins to
[52:17] tell us a story and he said these these
[52:20] these people are like eagles an eagle
[52:23] that was picked up by a farmer you You'
[52:26] all heard the story and and he was put
[52:29] in a chicken pin and hatched under a
[52:32] chicken but he was an eagle to begin
[52:35] with and his mama knew that he was that
[52:39] she was missing uh one of her eggs and
[52:41] so she went looking for him and one day
[52:44] he heard the voice of something that he
[52:46] never heard before now this little Eagle
[52:48] realized as he grew that something was
[52:50] wrong with the condition that he was in
[52:53] but you can't accuse the eagle all right
[52:55] come on yeah are you with me now you
[52:58] can't accuse him for being in a chicken
[53:00] pin you realize brother brandom tells us
[53:03] you don't he said don't get mad at the
[53:04] cner for being a
[53:05] sinner that's just what he
[53:08] is right but he needs a
[53:11] savior we shouldn't look down our noses
[53:13] at people for being what they are that's
[53:15] just what they are but we needed a
[53:17] savior and there was an eagle that come
[53:20] by one day and we heard a scream and we
[53:22] begin to get uncomfortable in our life
[53:24] and the way that we lived and we begin
[53:26] get uncomfortable with who we were and
[53:28] one day we heard the voice of the
[53:30] message of the hour and it spoke
[53:32] directly to our
[53:33] hearts and when it did what happened we
[53:36] were trapped in a chicken pin yes sir
[53:40] but we were an eagle to begin with yes
[53:44] Hallelujah and brother Brandon said this
[53:46] Eagle knew something was wrong he said
[53:48] there is something wrong that's right
[53:50] but you know that you were trapped into
[53:51] it at the beginning right notice the
[53:54] language that he uses you were trapped
[53:55] into it
[53:57] at the beginning see you were part to
[54:00] use another analogy of an arranged
[54:03] marriage huh you were part of an
[54:06] arranged
[54:08] marriage you were born in sin you come
[54:13] into the world and you were already
[54:15] married to the
[54:17] world and brother Rand said that's the
[54:19] reason the divorce when you divorced
[54:21] because you were trapped into it see by
[54:24] your first parents Adam and Eve you
[54:26] become a sinner by
[54:28] Nature by Nature you didn't want to be
[54:32] but now you heard the gospel and Faith
[54:35] cometh by hearing Revelation comes by
[54:37] hearing you realize you don't have to
[54:38] choose to be a sinner right I know some
[54:41] people think well you know I I'll just
[54:43] stay neutral I won't choose to be a
[54:45] sinner and I won't choose to be a
[54:47] Christian I'll just stay neutral that's
[54:48] not how it works you already are a
[54:51] sinner you need a
[54:52] savior I already was a sinner I needed a
[54:55] savior
[54:56] I needed I needed somebody to come by
[54:58] and plead my
[55:00] case and so he said you become a sinner
[55:03] by Nature you didn't want to be but now
[55:04] you heard the gospel and faith comes by
[55:06] hearing Revelation comes by hearing
[55:08] there's a little something inside of you
[55:11] again he said dear God the word has gone
[55:13] forth he was praying here he said it
[55:15] cannot return void it'll find its place
[55:17] somewhere if the seed has already been
[55:19] planted it'll water it till it grows and
[55:22] none can pluck it from your hand all
[55:24] someone say all all the father has given
[55:27] me will come to me and no man can pluck
[55:30] them out of my hand my father has given
[55:33] them to me before the foundation of the
[55:36] world I love this when the plans were
[55:39] all draw up as so Jesus was given his
[55:45] church his bride so you were given to
[55:50] Christ oh my as a bride before the
[55:54] beginning of time yeah how could you be
[55:58] lost right I know that's hard for people
[56:00] to swallow because you want to have
[56:02] something to do with that but you didn't
[56:04] have anything to do with that I didn't
[56:05] have anything to do with that all I have
[56:07] to do is respond to it say Lord I love
[56:09] you I thank you for doing it look what
[56:13] he says the bogus marriage of the world
[56:17] now watch the terms he's using because I
[56:20] believe God's trying to tell us
[56:21] something he said you were trapped into
[56:23] it it was a bogus marriage
[56:27] right a bogus marriage to these
[56:29] denominations he said you came and died
[56:31] into the world you redeemed her you
[56:33] Justified her she never did it at the
[56:36] first place she was trapped into it
[56:40] blind so you can see the misconduct of
[56:43] the prosecutor said you caused it you
[56:47] you you're the one that tricked her into
[56:49] this marriage now you're trying to tell
[56:51] her she can't get out of it but the old
[56:53] husband's
[56:55] dead he amen again he said but in the
[56:58] sight of God the bride is Justified she
[57:01] never done it in the first place
[57:03] standing there married to The Virtuous
[57:05] Son of God never sinned in the first
[57:09] place why she was for ordained she was
[57:13] trapped into this come on now I know you
[57:16] say brother Ben that sounds like an
[57:18] excuse it is but you only get to hear it
[57:21] one time or to use it one time and
[57:23] that's when you hear the gospel if you
[57:25] turn down the gospel you don't get to
[57:26] use the excuse you were trapped into it
[57:28] again because now you've heard it but if
[57:31] you heard the gospel and you responded
[57:33] to the gospel you can say I was trapped
[57:35] into it but when I heard the eagle
[57:37] scream then I came to
[57:39] it so I was trapped into it now look he
[57:43] said he said she never done it in the
[57:46] first place she was trapped in this and
[57:48] now when she heard the truth and come
[57:50] forth the blood cleansed her she stands
[57:52] there virtuous see she know sin on her
[57:55] and at all right no sin on her at all
[58:00] brother B makes it very clear and if you
[58:02] if you have a difficult time
[58:04] understanding this go back to the
[58:05] Hebrews series The Brand preaches a
[58:07] series uh called the Hebrews series he
[58:09] preach it's Hebrews chapter 1 and then
[58:11] chapter two and on down through the end
[58:13] of Hebrews and and when he preaches that
[58:16] series he deals extensively with his
[58:19] church and with Pentecostal people
[58:22] dealing with the idea of Grace and and
[58:25] what God is and how you can't be lost
[58:27] and what it means to be elected by God
[58:30] and it's very important for us as
[58:32] Believers to understand it because he
[58:35] talked about in that sermon about
[58:36] perfection because because Paul says
[58:38] let's go on to Perfection and how can we
[58:41] go on to Perfection and he says
[58:42] Perfection is Jesus Christ Perfection is
[58:46] Christ he's the only thing that's ever
[58:48] perfect so we're not going to find
[58:50] anything perfect so when we say let us
[58:51] go on to Perfection what are we going
[58:53] into we're going to Christ the word
[58:56] that's what we come to we cannot be
[58:58] perfect in our own righteousness we must
[59:00] be perfect through Christ so he said
[59:03] it's a perfect place calling you to that
[59:06] Perfection you have to be perfect to get
[59:08] there the Bible said so Jesus said be
[59:10] therefore perfect even as your father in
[59:13] Heaven is perfect it's a perfect Kingdom
[59:16] so it must be a perfect people come a
[59:19] perfect Kingdom now I you know I don't
[59:22] think well I know we don't I know we
[59:23] don't understand Perfection because
[59:25] we've never experienced exped
[59:27] it right Perfection to you you might
[59:30] this morning I think someone said it was
[59:32] a perfect morning but not
[59:35] exactly it was perfect but you got
[59:38] another day
[59:39] older the weather was nice but it's not
[59:42] exactly perfect but it was perfect for
[59:45] us because we don't really understand
[59:48] Perfection I don't think we would and
[59:50] forgive me for this but I think I don't
[59:52] think we look at it right and and and we
[59:54] can't because we're human beings we can
[59:56] only look at it things limited by time
[59:58] but if we knew how perfect it
[1:00:00] was number one we would we would reckon
[1:00:04] that our lives here were just a blip on
[1:00:06] the radar and we would understand that
[1:00:08] that that that that death ain't no big
[1:00:10] deal because we're going to a perfect
[1:00:12] place so perfect for us individually
[1:00:16] that we'll never want anything anymore
[1:00:18] we'll never have that longing or that
[1:00:20] desire for anything else other than that
[1:00:23] place oh that's the place I want to go
[1:00:25] to that's why we preach that's why we
[1:00:27] have church that's why we we give our
[1:00:29] all to God that's why we raise that's
[1:00:31] why we do what we do why there's a place
[1:00:33] there's a perfect place out there no
[1:00:36] matter what you're struggling with now
[1:00:38] there's a place of perfection that you
[1:00:39] can come to but we don't understand
[1:00:42] perfect because we're not perfect and
[1:00:44] yet he says the Bible said to come to
[1:00:47] that perfect place he said be therefore
[1:00:49] perfect you had to be perfect to get
[1:00:51] there it's a perfect Kingdom so it must
[1:00:53] be a perfect people come because you
[1:00:55] have to stand to be married to a perfect
[1:00:57] Son of God you must be a perfect bride
[1:00:59] so how can you do it through anything
[1:01:01] else but the perfect word of
[1:01:04] God oh thank you Lord which is the
[1:01:07] Waters of Separation that washes us from
[1:01:09] our sins that's right the blood of Jesus
[1:01:12] Christ think of it the dripping bloody
[1:01:15] word the blood the word of God bleeding
[1:01:18] blood to wash the bride in yes sir she
[1:01:20] stands perfect sir oh how by the blood
[1:01:25] yes she stands perfect virgin
[1:01:28] unadulterated she never sinned in the
[1:01:31] first place she was
[1:01:34] trapped into it yes so we've heard from
[1:01:37] the
[1:01:38] prosecutor and I think we all hear the
[1:01:40] voice of the prosecutor from time to
[1:01:42] time accusing us don't we we've heard
[1:01:46] the accusation of the
[1:01:48] prosecutor you've heard the response of
[1:01:52] our
[1:01:53] attorney now the judge has to make a
[1:01:57] decision you see it's all up to him
[1:02:00] whether we live or whether we
[1:02:02] die but in this hour we had to learn the
[1:02:05] true
[1:02:06] identity not only of the accuser but
[1:02:09] also of the
[1:02:12] judge see the scripture is very clear
[1:02:15] that the Messiah will be the judge of
[1:02:16] the earth go to Isaiah 16:5 it says in
[1:02:19] Mercy shall the throne be established
[1:02:21] and he shall sit upon it who who is he
[1:02:23] the Messiah right shall sit on it in
[1:02:26] Truth in the Tabernacle of David judging
[1:02:29] and seeking judgment and Hasting
[1:02:32] righteousness acts 10:42 which we read
[1:02:35] he commanded us to preach unto the
[1:02:37] people like that he commanded us to
[1:02:40] preach to the people and to testify that
[1:02:43] it is he which was ordained of God to be
[1:02:45] the judge of quick and dead acts 17:31
[1:02:49] because he has appointed a day in which
[1:02:51] he will judge the world he will judge
[1:02:53] who will Christ will judge the world in
[1:02:56] righteousness by that man whom he hath
[1:02:58] ordained where whereof Heath given
[1:03:00] Assurance unto all men that Heath raised
[1:03:02] him from the dead Revelation 1911 I saw
[1:03:05] heaven open and behold a white horse and
[1:03:07] he that set upon him who was he right
[1:03:10] that's Christ isn't it that comes back
[1:03:13] on a white horse he said he's called
[1:03:15] faithful and true and in righteousness
[1:03:17] what does he do he does judge and make
[1:03:19] war John 5:22 Jesus says it plainly for
[1:03:22] the father judgeth no man but has
[1:03:25] committed all all judgment someone say
[1:03:26] all judgment to the
[1:03:29] son every judgment is his to
[1:03:33] make I want you to understand this
[1:03:36] church to go to
[1:03:38] hell he would have to condemn
[1:03:43] you
[1:03:45] right every judgment is his to
[1:03:50] make I just love
[1:03:53] this and in our room drama you know as a
[1:03:59] young boy often thought of the father as
[1:04:01] sitting there and the son is coming up
[1:04:03] to the father and he's pleading the case
[1:04:06] to the father but we found out by the
[1:04:08] message of the hour I think what's
[1:04:10] important in this age that we learn this
[1:04:12] we get this Revelation that they're the
[1:04:14] same
[1:04:15] person right it's not two separate
[1:04:19] people church it's the same person and
[1:04:23] so the one that gets to make the final
[1:04:26] decision and he's the only one yeah
[1:04:29] right your parents can't make it right
[1:04:31] you can't you can't even make the
[1:04:33] decision someone else can't make it the
[1:04:35] one that gets to make the final decision
[1:04:37] on whether or not your sins would be
[1:04:39] dismissed would be him yeah it would be
[1:04:42] the son it would be him and his not just
[1:04:47] God but God as Jesus Christ does that
[1:04:51] make sense God revealed in his son so
[1:04:56] the the judge has scars in his
[1:05:01] hands could I say it that way the
[1:05:06] judge has
[1:05:08] blood oh my that he is offered for the
[1:05:12] defendant yeah you talk about a rigged
[1:05:17] Court the judge the only one who gets to
[1:05:21] say and and even trinitarians will tell
[1:05:24] you which it creates a problem for Trin
[1:05:25] Arians because they do not understand
[1:05:29] why uh why Jesus gets to do everything
[1:05:32] now in trinitarian Dogma now think about
[1:05:35] this the father does
[1:05:37] nothing because the Bible's very clear
[1:05:39] the son created the world Christ created
[1:05:42] the world they look at that as a
[1:05:43] separate person the Bible's very clear
[1:05:45] that he's the judge right he's the one
[1:05:48] coming back he's the one who sits on the
[1:05:49] throne he's the one we worship and so in
[1:05:52] trinitarian theology the father doesn't
[1:05:53] do anything
[1:05:56] because he commits everything to the son
[1:05:58] and so he's literally a person with no
[1:06:03] job that's right he absolutely has no
[1:06:07] job and then they have the Holy Spirit
[1:06:08] with no body so you got one here's a man
[1:06:12] with no job and a spirit with no
[1:06:14] body and and and Christ is doing
[1:06:17] everything but that's not what we
[1:06:18] believe we believe that it's God
[1:06:20] revealed or manifested in three
[1:06:21] different offices three different
[1:06:24] manifestations
[1:06:25] so what happened now he is the judge now
[1:06:28] remember that he is the
[1:06:31] judge and we know that when in this age
[1:06:35] we know this age has been judged are you
[1:06:37] still with me tonight I I I've been sick
[1:06:40] so I'm carrying this thing I usually use
[1:06:41] a Baptist microphone but using this one
[1:06:44] tonight
[1:06:45] because I've been sick and I'm just
[1:06:47] trying to talk to you much as I can but
[1:06:50] this this gets me
[1:06:52] excited he is the judge that's important
[1:06:56] to
[1:06:57] remember and but yet in this age he made
[1:07:00] a judgment on this age and in fact he
[1:07:03] indicted this generation right and he
[1:07:06] used a prophet to do that now you can
[1:07:09] get into it brother brandom talks about
[1:07:10] prophecy he said whatever the judge says
[1:07:13] the attorney the prophet just takes what
[1:07:15] the judge says or what the judge thinks
[1:07:18] and tells it to the people so the the
[1:07:20] prophet is an attorney for the
[1:07:23] judge right he's an attorney for the
[1:07:25] judge Jud so when he come to this age
[1:07:28] and indicted the age he did it through a
[1:07:31] prophet listen to what brother brandom
[1:07:32] says it's very stirring he says I stand
[1:07:34] in his defense right I'm his attorney he
[1:07:38] said and I indict you by the word of God
[1:07:41] right change your ways or you'll go to
[1:07:43] hell that's pretty harsh isn't it but
[1:07:46] it's the truth he's speaking to
[1:07:48] denominations down change your ways or
[1:07:50] you go to hell your denominations will
[1:07:52] crumble he said I indict you in the Pres
[1:07:55] presence of the
[1:07:57] judge huh the one who was there to make
[1:07:59] a decision he said I indict you in the
[1:08:02] presence of the judge right he said you
[1:08:04] with your forms of godliness hypocrisies
[1:08:07] and why do you call it he said ain't one
[1:08:08] Calvary
[1:08:11] enough ain't one Calvary what did they
[1:08:13] do they crucified him aresh ain't one
[1:08:16] Calvary enough but notice what he did he
[1:08:19] used his Prophet to do that his Prophet
[1:08:22] spoke an indictment oh Church
[1:08:26] he let his Prophet represent him to the
[1:08:28] denominations to indict them as a
[1:08:30] prosecutor but when it came time to be
[1:08:33] our attorney all right come on he didn't
[1:08:37] send a prophet to be our attorney right
[1:08:41] he sent a prophet to be his attorney to
[1:08:42] represent him to an age but he sent to
[1:08:46] be our attorney he didn't just represent
[1:08:49] himself through a prophet but he had to
[1:08:51] come down
[1:08:53] himself he had to come into our our age
[1:08:57] sir oh my no wonder brother BR said my
[1:09:00] Ministry is to to say he's
[1:09:03] here right now look at it it's always
[1:09:05] been that way John represented God's
[1:09:07] judgment on the Pharisees on Herod but
[1:09:10] Christ represented God's grace to those
[1:09:12] who would believe John 1:17 the law was
[1:09:15] given by Moses but Grace and Truth came
[1:09:18] by Jesus Christ see the judge and the
[1:09:21] attorney had to be the same person the
[1:09:23] attorney could not be the prophet even
[1:09:25] though the prophet was God's
[1:09:26] representative God's attorney to the
[1:09:29] world but the attorney could not be the
[1:09:30] prophet the attorney had to be Christ
[1:09:32] himself yes now brother Brandon presents
[1:09:36] this this idea he said what if youd
[1:09:37] committed a crime worthy of death he
[1:09:39] said you knew you were guilty and you
[1:09:40] must die if you don't get some attorney
[1:09:43] to represent you that that can get you
[1:09:45] out of the thing and you can imagine
[1:09:48] what that must feel like because you got
[1:09:50] to feel guilty because you did it all
[1:09:52] right but yet you don't want to die
[1:09:54] right I did it but I don't want to die
[1:09:56] for it I don't believe I should die and
[1:10:00] so now you want the best attorney you
[1:10:02] could have he said and then getting an
[1:10:05] attorney that was a good shrewd attorney
[1:10:07] you would feel that you could relax a
[1:10:09] little bit because you had an attorney
[1:10:12] but still there would be a question
[1:10:14] whether this attorney could change the
[1:10:16] judge's idea see if you're trying to
[1:10:19] approach the father through another
[1:10:21] person yes sir you would always have a
[1:10:24] question can they change the father's
[1:10:27] mind can they change the judge's mind
[1:10:31] right that's what he's telling us there
[1:10:33] would be a question whether this
[1:10:34] attorney could change the judge's idea
[1:10:36] or change the jury if this attorney with
[1:10:38] his shrewd speaking and the knowing of
[1:10:40] the laws could change that and could
[1:10:41] plead your case and prove that you
[1:10:43] should live listen if you're trying to
[1:10:45] live vicariously through a pastor trying
[1:10:47] to live through somebody else trying to
[1:10:49] live through a church it'll never work
[1:10:51] you've got to speak directly to the
[1:10:53] judge because he is your attorney right
[1:10:58] amen he said yet in all of his great
[1:11:01] Authority and the great speech he could
[1:11:03] make and the impression he could put
[1:11:06] upon the jury or have with the judge
[1:11:08] maybe you might get relaxed for a few
[1:11:10] minutes but still there would be a
[1:11:12] question in your mind can he do
[1:11:19] it he said well he's got an unbroken
[1:11:22] record so far well my case is pretty
[1:11:28] bad I actually did it and the law says I
[1:11:32] should
[1:11:34] die but is my attorney good
[1:11:37] enough oh my that's the question
[1:11:41] church and your confidence in your
[1:11:43] attorney will be your outlook on life
[1:11:46] and whether or not you can have the
[1:11:47] faith to to believe and live a Christian
[1:11:50] Life be whether you have confidence or
[1:11:52] not in your attorney you see there would
[1:11:55] be a question with the attorney he said
[1:11:58] but in this case amen the case we're
[1:12:01] talking about tonight the case between
[1:12:04] you and
[1:12:05] God huh the judge himself becomes our
[1:12:11] attorney God became man there was no
[1:12:13] attorney could do it we couldn't find
[1:12:15] one Moses and the law the prophets
[1:12:18] nothing could do it so the judge become
[1:12:20] both jury attorney and judge himself and
[1:12:23] took the justice of his in his own hands
[1:12:26] and paid the price of it himself how
[1:12:30] much more secure could we be can you
[1:12:33] imagine how you how you would feel if
[1:12:36] you went to court and you found out the
[1:12:39] judge paid your bail all
[1:12:42] right I heard about this
[1:12:45] judge this guy this guy came before him
[1:12:49] and and and they said he said what's his
[1:12:51] crime he said well he stole a loaf of
[1:12:53] bread and uh and he said uh he saidwell
[1:12:58] how much was the loaf of bread worth He
[1:12:59] said 50 cents he said okay I'll find you
[1:13:01] 50
[1:13:02] cents and then so the man come and he
[1:13:05] paid us or or the judge said but he said
[1:13:07] I'm not going to make you pay it he said
[1:13:08] I'm going to pay it so he pays the 50
[1:13:11] cents and then he says I got another
[1:13:13] statement to make he said I'm gonna find
[1:13:16] everybody else in the courtroom 50 cents
[1:13:18] a piece for living in a city that would
[1:13:21] make a man steal to feed his family
[1:13:25] judge can do stuff like that what if the
[1:13:28] judge in your case if you saw him down
[1:13:31] at the window paying your bail you could
[1:13:35] you'd have a pretty good
[1:13:38] idea oh Church you'd have a pretty good
[1:13:42] idea that you were going to make it a
[1:13:44] pretty good idea he wasn't going to lose
[1:13:46] you you weren't going to lose that case
[1:13:48] because he's already stepped in weighed
[1:13:50] in in your favor don't you realize the
[1:13:52] judge has already weighed in in your
[1:13:54] favor
[1:13:56] what did he do the judge became both
[1:13:58] jury attorney and judge himself and took
[1:14:01] the justice of his law in his own hands
[1:14:03] and paid the price of it himself how
[1:14:06] much more secure could we be send his
[1:14:09] own life back upon us as a witness he'd
[1:14:12] accepted how safely the said would' be
[1:14:14] like David Walking In the Valley of the
[1:14:15] shadow of death he said I fear no evil
[1:14:19] for thou art with me when he becomes
[1:14:22] both judge jury and attorney he pleaded
[1:14:24] our case we found guilty by his own law
[1:14:27] he come and took the guilty person's
[1:14:28] place was in the sanctuary he took his
[1:14:31] sin he took it upon himself and died
[1:14:34] paid the price and shed his blood and
[1:14:35] give back his own
[1:14:37] token his own life he said why we are
[1:14:41] perfectly listen the case is
[1:14:45] dismissed glory to God there's no more
[1:14:49] sin to the believer yes oh God have
[1:14:55] mercy I I've had people ask me I've
[1:14:57] dealt with this several times because I
[1:14:59] think it's important I've had people
[1:15:01] tell me say well I believe God's
[1:15:03] punishing me for doing something how
[1:15:04] could
[1:15:06] he how could he punish you for what he
[1:15:08] doesn't see himself come
[1:15:12] on he'll correct you he'll he'll let you
[1:15:15] go through some things he'll he'll bring
[1:15:18] you through fire sometimes just for your
[1:15:20] character building job didn't do nothing
[1:15:22] wrong and God still brought him through
[1:15:24] through the fire but he brought him
[1:15:27] through when he got done he had twice as
[1:15:29] much as when he went in but what was it
[1:15:32] he was just building his character he
[1:15:34] was showing him who he was he wasn't
[1:15:37] punishing his son he's not punishing you
[1:15:40] right the case has been dismissed and
[1:15:43] it's been dismissed with prejudice it
[1:15:45] can't ever be brought again quit letting
[1:15:47] the devil beat you up for what you
[1:15:51] done yes sir said brother Ben you always
[1:15:53] preach as people do whatever they want
[1:15:55] to I want people to do whatever they
[1:15:56] want to sir just if you're a Christian
[1:16:00] you want to do what's
[1:16:03] right brother brandom said that if you
[1:16:06] he said if you only go to church because
[1:16:08] he said if you only serve him because
[1:16:09] you want to you want to escape hell he
[1:16:12] said you're a
[1:16:13] fraud you're a hypocrite right well
[1:16:17] listen to the Hebrew series it's a
[1:16:19] strong we don't do it we don't we don't
[1:16:21] serve God to escape hell we serve God
[1:16:24] because there's been a revelation of
[1:16:25] Grace in our life we know he loved us
[1:16:28] from the
[1:16:30] beginning Amen brother B say why we are
[1:16:33] perfectly the case is dismissed there's
[1:16:35] no more sin to the believer he said oh
[1:16:36] God have mercy if the people can't see
[1:16:38] that there is no more case and he bases
[1:16:41] that on John 5:24 verily verily I say un
[1:16:44] you he that heareth my word and
[1:16:46] believeth on him that sent me hath
[1:16:48] everlasting
[1:16:50] life if you have everlasting life how do
[1:16:53] you lose that
[1:16:55] you
[1:16:56] can't shall not come into condemnation
[1:16:59] but is
[1:17:00] passed from Death To
[1:17:04] Life there is the
[1:17:07] case case
[1:17:11] dismissed I didn't say that a prophet of
[1:17:13] God stood there and said that there is
[1:17:15] the
[1:17:18] case John 5:24 that's our attorney
[1:17:21] statement that's our judge's statement
[1:17:24] yes oh my there is the case case
[1:17:27] dismissed no more case to it than safely
[1:17:30] safely with the token applied When Death
[1:17:33] begins to Smite against the door out
[1:17:34] there it has no control that's why I
[1:17:37] said death ain't no big deal when you
[1:17:39] really understand what he's done for you
[1:17:41] why because death has no control over
[1:17:44] you spiritual death has no control and
[1:17:47] natural death has no control over the
[1:17:50] believer no wonder Paul can say oh death
[1:17:51] where is thy steam oh grave where is thy
[1:17:54] victory
[1:17:55] brother Brenham talked about death as
[1:17:56] the the bee of death that that that
[1:17:59] buzzed Around Jesus on the cross and it
[1:18:01] had a stinger in it he said and when it
[1:18:04] when it when it sunk that Stinger into
[1:18:06] the Flesh of Jesus Christ when it pulled
[1:18:08] it out it pulled the stinger out and the
[1:18:11] bee can still buzz but it can't sting no
[1:18:15] more look what he says I'm free tonight
[1:18:18] Hallelujah I'm so glad that I'm free the
[1:18:20] sting of death is gone how many you say
[1:18:22] Amen to that tonight death may come in
[1:18:24] but it may come and threaten me it'll
[1:18:27] threaten all of you yeah hey I got a
[1:18:29] 15-year-old that's learning to drive
[1:18:31] death threatens me every
[1:18:36] day actually I've got a 15-year-old and
[1:18:38] a 17y
[1:18:41] old y'all pray for us pray for the other
[1:18:44] drivers too some of y'all won't drive
[1:18:47] now for a
[1:18:49] month but death will threaten
[1:18:53] you it starts threatening you when
[1:18:55] you're about 39 I
[1:18:58] know well your life's about halfway over
[1:19:00] what do you
[1:19:02] think what are you going to do if you're
[1:19:04] going to do anything for the Lord as
[1:19:05] brother BR said you better do it now
[1:19:07] right none of us are promised tomorrow
[1:19:10] death may come and Buzz it may come and
[1:19:11] threaten me it may come to pull me away
[1:19:14] but like one writer said God harnessed
[1:19:16] it to a buggy it can only pull me in his
[1:19:20] presence where I long to be where every
[1:19:23] believer longs to be listen if this was
[1:19:27] the hour of the revealing of our
[1:19:28] Attorney judge he must be present in
[1:19:31] this day as a judge to dismiss the case
[1:19:33] yeah he's already paid the price he's
[1:19:35] been our attorney now he's our judge
[1:19:38] this is the hour when the head comes to
[1:19:40] the body the hour Perfection the case
[1:19:42] could only be continued under the blood
[1:19:43] of bulls and goats but now it's been
[1:19:45] dismissed never to be remembered again
[1:19:48] remember every time they'd offer a
[1:19:49] sacrifice it' put it off for another
[1:19:51] year right was just a continuance
[1:19:54] but now the judge has said it's
[1:19:57] dismissed never to be remembered again
[1:20:01] right remember and I I don't have the
[1:20:04] the picture on my Sid so I don't think
[1:20:05] but remember when he come uh he showed
[1:20:07] his brother Wendell dealt with it over
[1:20:10] the meetings but he showed himself as
[1:20:12] the cloud in the form of the cloud what
[1:20:15] was so significant about that he was
[1:20:17] wigged in the cloud he was wearing a
[1:20:20] white wig and in Revelation 1114 the
[1:20:24] Bible says this head and his hairs were
[1:20:25] white like wool white as snow and
[1:20:29] brother Brandon when he preached the
[1:20:30] seven Church ages he didn't understand
[1:20:31] that scripture because the prophet
[1:20:33] doesn't know everything until God
[1:20:34] reveals it to him and so he calls Jack
[1:20:37] Moore to ask him about it and Jack Moore
[1:20:39] told him he said well that uh that meant
[1:20:41] this or that and and he said well I just
[1:20:43] couldn't hardly believe that but he said
[1:20:46] he said I said he was a young man that's
[1:20:48] where the Revelation come he said about
[1:20:49] that being a wig on not him he's wigged
[1:20:53] he said he's young he's got a black
[1:20:54] beard he said but he was wigged he said
[1:20:56] I couldn't understand it as being
[1:20:58] Supreme deity he said but the old judges
[1:21:00] used to in Israel had to be whiteh
[1:21:02] headed and the white stands for Purity
[1:21:04] and the English judges to this day in
[1:21:06] Supreme Courts of England put on a white
[1:21:08] wig when they come out because there's
[1:21:10] no other law above theirs on Earth and
[1:21:12] they Supreme judge what does that mean
[1:21:14] church if he says it's dismissed it's
[1:21:19] over what happened in this age the judge
[1:21:22] had to be present to dismiss
[1:21:26] case I know some of you are thinking
[1:21:28] right now you as I'm closing in just a
[1:21:30] moment you say brother Ben I sinned
[1:21:32] again I come to the message and I messed
[1:21:35] up I come to church and I did good for a
[1:21:37] while but then I messed up let me talk
[1:21:39] to you for just a
[1:21:41] moment John wrote to his church of that
[1:21:45] first age and he said my little children
[1:21:47] these things right out unto you that you
[1:21:48] sin not if any man sin we have an
[1:21:51] advocate with the father that word
[1:21:53] advocate is a
[1:21:55] attorney we have an attorney with the
[1:21:57] father Jesus Christ the righteous you
[1:22:00] need to remember your judge is still
[1:22:02] your
[1:22:02] attorney he doesn't suddenly become two
[1:22:06] persons after you get saved and suddenly
[1:22:09] start judging you for the things that
[1:22:11] you do he don't do that the case of
[1:22:14] original sin cannot be brought
[1:22:17] again I hope you're hear me it can't be
[1:22:19] can't be brought again now we know that
[1:22:24] that our attorney that everyone he
[1:22:28] represents the judge declares pardon
[1:22:31] because he's the same person why would
[1:22:33] he work against
[1:22:34] himself right so Look what Jesus said
[1:22:37] when he was here John 17:9 he said I
[1:22:39] pray for them I pray not for the world
[1:22:42] but I pray for them which thou Hast
[1:22:44] given me for they are thine they belong
[1:22:47] to the
[1:22:48] judge and the attorney oh my all mine
[1:22:52] are thine and thine are mine
[1:22:55] and I am glorified in them brother Bram
[1:22:56] said the believer can't
[1:22:58] sin this a strong meat tonight but I
[1:23:00] want you to brother Bram taught it over
[1:23:02] and over and over again certainly not
[1:23:04] the seed of God the blessings of God
[1:23:06] remains on him God can't see nothing but
[1:23:08] the blood of his own son no matter
[1:23:11] what's in what is in his church what it
[1:23:12] is God don't see it because Jesus is
[1:23:16] making intercession constantly the high
[1:23:18] priest no way for him to sin so all them
[1:23:22] complaints you make to God oh God did
[1:23:24] you see what brother so and so did to me
[1:23:27] well they're a real True Believer God
[1:23:28] don't see it
[1:23:31] right all that complaining we do might
[1:23:33] make us feel better but God don't even
[1:23:36] see it I love brother brandom when he
[1:23:39] was talking about he he said he was out
[1:23:41] in the woods praying out by his cave
[1:23:43] when he got the revelation of of uh of
[1:23:46] the wheat and the tears but he said the
[1:23:49] reason he was out there praying is
[1:23:50] because Dr Davis had said some awful
[1:23:52] things about him in in the paper that's
[1:23:55] why he was out there praying he said I
[1:23:57] was praying that God would forgive him
[1:23:59] yeah all right oh my I believe that's
[1:24:02] the way we ought to be Oh my he said
[1:24:05] there's no way he said no matter what it
[1:24:06] is in the church no way for him to sin
[1:24:08] when such a sacrifice is laying there
[1:24:09] for him certainly not now if you say
[1:24:12] well that gives me a good chance he said
[1:24:13] that shows you're not right he said
[1:24:15] you'll appreciate that you'll love it if
[1:24:17] you're a real Christian to a place that
[1:24:19] sin would haunt you till you couldn't do
[1:24:21] it for the seed of God remains in him
[1:24:25] and he cannot
[1:24:27] sin the Bible said one's purged by the
[1:24:29] blood of Jesus has no more desire of sin
[1:24:32] if you have a desire your heart is not
[1:24:34] right with God he said now you will do
[1:24:38] wrong but you don't do it willfully
[1:24:40] willfully from what from the seed you
[1:24:42] don't do it from the inside man your
[1:24:45] flesh wants to do it
[1:24:46] obviously you wouldn't do it but he said
[1:24:48] see you're trapped and anything you're
[1:24:50] trapped into or do something that you
[1:24:52] don't mean to do it listen it's not sin
[1:24:56] yet look here's the difference you take
[1:24:58] someone that's been born again it's not
[1:25:00] sin yet you'll repent the minute you see
[1:25:03] you're
[1:25:04] wrong you'll turn quickly and say I
[1:25:07] didn't mean didn't see that he said
[1:25:09] you'll say that all through life better
[1:25:13] get used to some of our elders could say
[1:25:14] Amen tonight you better get used to it
[1:25:18] what about condemnation well that's the
[1:25:20] tool of the devil that's the only tool
[1:25:21] he's
[1:25:22] got right that's the only tool he's got
[1:25:25] left in his box he had a whole bunch of
[1:25:28] tools and God took them all away from
[1:25:29] him only thing he's got left is
[1:25:32] condemnation right the feeling of
[1:25:34] condemnation not actual condemnation
[1:25:36] because actual condemnation is passed we
[1:25:40] can't even have that but his recourse is
[1:25:43] to get you to act as if the case has not
[1:25:46] been dismissed all right because if he
[1:25:49] gets you to act in that way then it
[1:25:51] doesn't matter if it's been dismissed or
[1:25:53] not but listen what he said there is
[1:25:55] therefore now no condemnation to them
[1:25:57] which are in Christ Jesus listen who
[1:25:59] walk not after the flesh but after the
[1:26:01] spirit that Greek word for walk is the
[1:26:03] action of walking
[1:26:06] now it's just the devil you know what he
[1:26:08] does he makes us condemned about being
[1:26:12] condemned right he'll actually bring
[1:26:16] condemnation to us about having
[1:26:19] condemnation but the Bible says there is
[1:26:21] no condemnation that's a statement of
[1:26:23] fact
[1:26:24] those whose actions of Life are
[1:26:27] influenced by the spirit and not by the
[1:26:30] flesh to use an analogy that brother
[1:26:32] Joel is famous for using uh there was an
[1:26:35] Indian chief one time and and a man
[1:26:38] asked me said how are you doing he said
[1:26:39] pretty good and pretty bad he said he
[1:26:43] said why why do you say pretty good and
[1:26:44] pretty bad he said because there's two
[1:26:45] dogs
[1:26:47] fighting he said one's a good dog and
[1:26:49] one's a bad
[1:26:51] dog he said a white dog and a black dog
[1:26:55] and he said they fight one with another
[1:26:58] and when they fight he said they the the
[1:27:00] good dog and the bad dog he said well
[1:27:02] which one wins he said the one she feeds
[1:27:04] the
[1:27:06] most right he said that just depends on
[1:27:09] the Waring of the body that's in you it
[1:27:11] depends on which one you cater to which
[1:27:13] nature you cater to the carnal nature
[1:27:16] after the things of the world or the
[1:27:17] spiritual nature to the things of God
[1:27:19] see we could get into the service we
[1:27:21] could spend the whole service thinking
[1:27:22] about McDonald's
[1:27:25] it just depends on which one we cater to
[1:27:28] we could get into the service or we
[1:27:29] could spend the whole service thinking
[1:27:31] about tomorrow but which one we cater to
[1:27:33] depends on which one
[1:27:34] wins but John said beloved if our heart
[1:27:37] condemn us not then we have confidence
[1:27:39] toward God that's what we want tonight
[1:27:41] we want confidence our case has been
[1:27:43] dismissed our attorney is the judge and
[1:27:46] he dismissed it with prejudice I wish I
[1:27:48] had the voice to preach it tonight he
[1:27:51] dismissed it with prejudice he said
[1:27:53] whatsoever we ask we receive of him
[1:27:56] because we keep his Commandments you say
[1:27:57] oh there it is oh that means I can keep
[1:28:00] the law and we'll get what I want now
[1:28:02] listen what he says he said do those
[1:28:04] things that are pleasing in his sight
[1:28:05] you say brother Ben give me a list of
[1:28:06] things to do
[1:28:08] okay I'm going to do
[1:28:11] that I'm going to do that that next
[1:28:14] verse is a list of things you have to do
[1:28:17] to keep the Commandments of God
[1:28:19] everything's on it do you know that
[1:28:23] that's what he says this is is his
[1:28:25] commandment you want to know what you
[1:28:27] should do what you shouldn't do say
[1:28:30] brother B what's the list of rules to
[1:28:31] belong to Word of Life Tabernacle here
[1:28:33] it
[1:28:35] is this is what you got to do to be a
[1:28:37] member of the Bride some say you got to
[1:28:40] jump some say you got to shout but this
[1:28:41] is what he said this is the
[1:28:44] Commandment this is his commandment we
[1:28:47] should believe on the name of his son
[1:28:49] Jesus Christ and love one
[1:28:52] another as he gave us commandment that's
[1:28:54] pretty simple isn't
[1:28:58] it there is therefore now no
[1:29:01] condemnation to them who walk after
[1:29:06] that believe why would you sit in church
[1:29:09] your whole life under
[1:29:13] condemnation and I know I've experienced
[1:29:15] the joy of the Lord as the musicians
[1:29:17] come I know what it's like to feel the
[1:29:19] presence of God I know many of you do as
[1:29:22] well
[1:29:24] but why why would why would you want to
[1:29:28] sit there and and only feel condemnation
[1:29:32] every time you you're just always under
[1:29:34] conviction you know how to fix that
[1:29:36] repent and
[1:29:40] believe repent and believe be honest
[1:29:44] with your attorney he already knows
[1:29:46] anyway in fact he already paid for it be
[1:29:49] honest with him and then if you're a
[1:29:52] Christian just don't let the devil back
[1:29:54] in you know when they when they built
[1:29:56] the Great Wall of China they built a
[1:29:58] wall that was so massive that no Army
[1:30:01] could get past
[1:30:02] it and it was so high no Army no there
[1:30:06] was no technology to overcome the Great
[1:30:08] Wall of China it's still there they
[1:30:12] built it so big and I'm sure they were
[1:30:14] so proud of it but they were invaded
[1:30:16] three times in the first hundred years
[1:30:20] that wall was built you know what they
[1:30:22] did they bribed The Gatekeepers
[1:30:26] you're a
[1:30:28] gatekeeper you got a gate in the mind
[1:30:30] that's a gate to the soul you're a
[1:30:33] gatekeeper the only way the devil can
[1:30:35] get you is to bribe
[1:30:38] you so he says he says I'll you know
[1:30:43] watch
[1:30:44] this do this he bribes you and then
[1:30:46] condemnation comes
[1:30:48] in that's the only way he can get in is
[1:30:51] to offer you temporary pleasure but I
[1:30:54] say Lord I'm going to stand for the word
[1:30:56] I'm going to do what's right I'm going
[1:30:57] to believe I'm I'm going to I'm going to
[1:31:00] do what God said I'm going to believe no
[1:31:01] matter what the devil says about me no
[1:31:04] matter how much of it is true because I
[1:31:06] know that devil the one who's talking is
[1:31:08] the one who got me to do it in the first
[1:31:10] place so I'm not going to listen to him
[1:31:13] no more I'm not going to listen to the
[1:31:15] accuser can you say Amen to that tonight
[1:31:16] I'm not going to listen to him anymore
[1:31:18] I'm going to only listen to the one who
[1:31:20] can give me joy and peace that passes
[1:31:23] all understand standing would you bow
[1:31:24] your heads with us
[1:31:25] tonight as we go to the Lord in prayer
[1:31:28] maybe you'd like to be
[1:31:31] remembered I apologize tonight I don't
[1:31:33] have a lot of
[1:31:35] breath but I felt like I needed to
[1:31:37] preach and it's just something the lord
[1:31:39] gave
[1:31:40] me I don't know who it was
[1:31:45] for I don't believe he does
[1:31:48] anything randomly it's always on purpose
[1:31:52] maybe you like to just lift your hand to
[1:31:53] him and say
[1:31:54] but been remember me tonight
