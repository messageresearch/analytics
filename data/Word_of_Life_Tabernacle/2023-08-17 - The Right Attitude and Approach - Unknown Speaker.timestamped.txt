[42:49] we're gonna go to Mark chapter 5 and
[42:52] verse 24 Mark chapter 5 verse 24 down
[42:56] through verse 28.
[42:57] and then we'll also read from John 11
[42:59] 21-22
[43:01] Mark 5 24
[43:04] and John 11 21
[43:08] good to be in the house of the Lord on a
[43:10] Wednesday night
[43:11] amen I thank God for these Wednesday
[43:13] nights it just seems like we're uh we're
[43:16] comfortable and able to preach the word
[43:18] I've always enjoyed a Wednesday night
[43:19] service I know what I was working which
[43:22] I did for many years in the public and
[43:24] and coming to church on Wednesday nights
[43:27] I was always tired but also it was just
[43:30] such a refreshing time to just take your
[43:32] thoughts off of everything else in your
[43:34] mind off of work and just come and sit
[43:36] in the quietness of the church and then
[43:39] to come in and Worship the Lord and and
[43:41] just give him all that we have so I'm
[43:43] I'm still it's still special to me to
[43:45] come in on a Wednesday night because I'm
[43:47] worshiping here with you as well so we
[43:51] just thank God that we're able to do
[43:52] that Mark 5 24 it says and Jesus went
[43:55] with him and much people followed him
[43:58] and thronged him
[44:00] and a certain woman which had an issue
[44:02] of blood 12 years and had suffered many
[44:05] things of many Physicians have spent all
[44:08] that she had and was nothing better but
[44:10] rather grew worse when she had heard of
[44:13] Jesus
[44:15] aim in the press behind and touched His
[44:18] Garment
[44:19] for she said if I may touch but his
[44:23] clothes I shall be whole
[44:26] what a statement of faith and then John
[44:28] 11 21
[44:37] then said Martha unto Jesus Lord if thou
[44:40] has been here my brother had not died
[44:45] but I know
[44:47] isn't this wonderful I know that even
[44:51] now
[44:53] whatsoever thou will ask of God
[44:56] will give it thee
[44:58] amen I pray the Lord that is blessing to
[45:00] the word you may be seated this evening
[45:03] I want to talk to you about the right
[45:05] attitude and approach
[45:07] the right attitude and approach
[45:09] everything that we do requires an
[45:12] attitude and an approach that would be
[45:14] appropriate to that situation that we're
[45:18] in when it comes to Faith that it's no
[45:20] different you've got to have a right
[45:22] attitude you got to have a right
[45:23] approach you've got to have a right uh a
[45:26] right motive a right objective it's not
[45:29] just that when we reach an age of the
[45:31] spoken word as we'll be talking about
[45:33] tonight that suddenly you can just speak
[45:35] things into existence and and just
[45:38] whatever comes into your mind that you
[45:39] just speak it but that's not what the
[45:41] spoken word is at all in fact a prophet
[45:44] had to wait for inspiration for God to
[45:47] actually speak those things and and so
[45:50] we wait on those things and and we make
[45:52] sure that our motives are right and the
[45:54] atmosphere is right and and what we're
[45:56] saying this I was in the in the office
[45:58] thinking about these things I picked up
[46:01] this little book I don't know if you
[46:02] have it uh healing thoughts sister
[46:04] Rebecca Branham put together some time
[46:06] ago and opened up and it fell to this
[46:09] page and I don't have this in my notes
[46:11] but brother Branham says this he said no
[46:13] selfish thing will work
[46:15] your motives and objectives have to be
[46:18] exactly perfectly right and then you
[46:21] have faith
[46:23] he said if our hearts condemn us not we
[46:25] have confidence First John 3 21 we've
[46:27] got to have confidence so to come boldly
[46:31] Before the Throne of God in order to
[46:33] really believe that what we're saying is
[46:35] going to happen it's got to be right
[46:37] we've got to have the right motives
[46:39] behind it and not just that we're
[46:40] telling ourself that it's the right
[46:43] motive but is it really the right motive
[46:45] does it match up with the word
[46:47] so then if our hearts condemn us not
[46:50] then we have confidence we've got to
[46:52] have confidence he said say I want this
[46:55] to the honor and glory of God he said
[46:58] then faith has a channel to move into if
[47:01] it doesn't then you've got a mental
[47:03] intellectual Faith he said I'm not a
[47:05] genuine Faith from God he said that
[47:07] intellectual faith will get you nowhere
[47:09] it might get you emotional but it won't
[47:11] get you the healing that you're looking
[47:13] for so we want something more we want
[47:15] something real don't you want something
[47:18] real and and so you've got to have the
[47:20] right motive the right objective and
[47:22] also the right attitude and the right
[47:24] approach now the Branham taught this all
[47:27] through his ministry that the right
[47:29] mental attitude towards the promise of
[47:30] God towards the gifts of God would bring
[47:33] results he says the right mental
[47:35] attitude towards any Divine promise of
[47:37] God will bring it to pass
[47:40] will bring it to pass he said if you can
[47:43] look at it the way God wrote it and
[47:45] accept it in your heart God will make
[47:48] that word come to life aren't you glad
[47:51] you serve a God Like That
[47:53] so now uh brother Branham when he talks
[47:56] about these things he always used the
[47:58] story of the woman with the issue of
[48:00] blood and also the story of Martha at
[48:03] Lazarus grave to illustrate how uh that
[48:07] what the right mental attitude was and
[48:09] what the right approach was to the gift
[48:11] of God and to the promise of God so
[48:14] these women somehow they they tapped
[48:17] into that without having been taught or
[48:19] anything else but but they but they just
[48:21] seem to know what the right approach was
[48:24] there was something about them that
[48:26] their attitude was right and they were
[48:27] their approach was right and I pray God
[48:29] help me to come to church with the right
[48:31] attitude help me to come on a Wednesday
[48:33] night with the right approach to God you
[48:35] don't get nothing from nobody by coming
[48:37] with arrogance and or coming with uh
[48:40] with hate or coming with the ungodliness
[48:42] in your life but you've got to have you
[48:44] got to have the right attitude
[48:46] you know you you can't even get uh you
[48:49] can't even get a response from people
[48:51] without the right attitude
[48:53] right they'll they'll they'll they'll
[48:55] sit there and look at you but if you've
[48:57] got a good attitude people will respond
[48:59] people you that's what leadership is is
[49:02] is is trying to project something I
[49:05] project I realize when I come out here I
[49:07] project my attitude to the congregation
[49:09] if I've got a bad attitude here brother
[49:12] Joe on us Wednesday night you will too
[49:16] at least by the time you leave
[49:19] so if you don't have a good attitude
[49:20] tonight if you came here in a bad
[49:22] attitude borrow mine for a little while
[49:24] we'll we'll just be all right when we
[49:25] get done
[49:27] the attitude spread but these somehow
[49:30] they had a right attitude even though
[49:32] their situations weren't good even
[49:35] though she this woman was sick that
[49:37] touched him of His Garment she'd been
[49:38] sick for a long time
[49:40] she had no promise even direct promise
[49:43] from God like we do have a direct
[49:44] promise of healing but she had no direct
[49:46] promise of that she touched him of His
[49:49] Garment but she said it I I believe
[49:52] that if I can Touch the Hem of His
[49:53] Garment I'll be whole
[49:56] huh so it was the attitude that she had
[49:59] that produced faith and got a response
[50:01] from Christ and that's what we're
[50:03] looking for now we have to take the
[50:05] right mental attitude towards the
[50:08] promised word of the hour what were they
[50:09] doing that he Christ was the promised
[50:12] word of the hour for that day and they
[50:15] had to take the right mental attitude
[50:17] towards that promised manifested word of
[50:20] God for the day so what were they doing
[50:22] what would it be it would be how do I
[50:25] approach this person how do I come in
[50:28] his presence how do I how do I get what
[50:30] I need from this person but not when the
[50:33] sense of manipulating the person but
[50:35] what would be the right way to come
[50:38] so and that would help us in every area
[50:40] of our life by the way if we come in the
[50:42] right attitude we'd get more the old
[50:45] saying is uh honey attracts a lot more
[50:48] than than something that would taste bad
[50:51] right that's not the same but it's
[50:53] that's the meaning of it
[50:55] honey I think his honey attracts more
[50:57] flies than vinegar or something like
[50:58] that
[50:59] but but now uh we if we take the right
[51:03] attitude we get the right results a lot
[51:05] of people don't want to demand results
[51:07] that's not how it works it's not how it
[51:09] works in marriage it's not how it works
[51:11] in a church not how it works at school
[51:12] not how it works in business and it's
[51:14] not how it works with God
[51:17] all right so now in in the promises of
[51:21] this day I want to give you some
[51:22] scriptures these are promises for our
[51:24] day what attitude should we take to Mark
[51:28] 16 17. these signs shall follow them
[51:30] that believe in my name shall they cast
[51:33] out Devils they shall speak with two
[51:34] tongues they shall take up serpents if
[51:36] they drink any deadly thing it shall not
[51:38] hurt them they shall lay hands on the
[51:40] sick and they shall recover you say well
[51:41] if Jesus was here I'd have the right
[51:43] attitude towards him but the attitude
[51:45] you take towards the word towards these
[51:48] scriptures that brother random taught us
[51:49] from for our day is the same attitude
[51:52] you would have towards him if he were
[51:54] here in the flesh
[51:56] so so he said they'll lay hands on it
[51:59] what attitude do we take towards Mark 16
[52:01] 18. they shall take up serpents of the
[52:04] drinking deadly thing it won't hurt them
[52:06] they show their hands on the sick they
[52:07] shall recover What attitude should we
[52:09] take to John 14 12.
[52:11] verily verily I say unto you he that
[52:13] believeth on me the works that I do
[52:15] shall he do also and Greater Works than
[52:18] these shall he do because I go into my
[52:20] father and whatsoever you shall ask in
[52:23] my name that will I do that the father
[52:26] may be glorified in the son if you shall
[52:29] ask anything in my name he said I will
[52:31] do it what should be our attitude
[52:33] towards that word
[52:37] and so he promised us then that we would
[52:40] do the greater work so I want to look at
[52:41] that for just a moment because it kind
[52:43] of goes back into What attitude and what
[52:46] approach we should have in Mark 11 23 he
[52:49] said apparently asking to whosoever
[52:51] shall say unto this mountain be thou
[52:53] removed and be thou cast into the sea
[52:55] and shall not down in his heart but
[52:56] shall believe that those things which he
[52:58] saith shall come to pass he shall have
[53:00] whatsoever he saith now remember
[53:02] remember that it's got to be something
[53:05] that God said
[53:06] for you to have confidence in it it
[53:09] can't be just something you dreamed up
[53:11] what would have been I I've got I I Got
[53:14] Confidence I'm gonna go out and play the
[53:15] lottery and win
[53:17] well though you'd probably just be down
[53:18] a dollar or two or however much a
[53:20] lottery costs these days
[53:22] you might win just so they'd be
[53:24] broadcast the newspapers that you were
[53:26] playing that you were gambling
[53:29] that's what the lottery is by the way in
[53:31] case anybody didn't know
[53:33] it's legalize gambling
[53:35] right but but but that's not the
[53:37] attitude it's not the right approach
[53:40] right we you know the right approach of
[53:44] faith
[53:45] is to is to do what God says everything
[53:50] he says and then believe for what you
[53:53] can't do
[53:55] right right so it doesn't do any good if
[53:58] I if I'm not taking care of my family it
[54:01] doesn't do any good to sit here and have
[54:02] oh I believe there's going to be a check
[54:03] in the mail I believe that it's gonna
[54:05] there's something if I'm not taking care
[54:06] of my family it doesn't do me any good I
[54:08] don't take care of my family first do
[54:11] the things I know to do and then God
[54:13] will do the rest but don't you believe
[54:14] he can do exceedingly abundantly even
[54:16] more we could ask or think absolutely he
[54:19] can't but we got to do our part first
[54:22] that's our confidence we don't have any
[54:24] confidence if we don't do our part
[54:26] so count the cost and then believe
[54:31] right that's the attitude the right
[54:32] attitude towards the word count the cost
[54:35] and believe
[54:37] hey man now then so one time brother
[54:41] Brown said talking about this this
[54:43] scripture of the Greater Works he said
[54:45] one time he said about the third poll
[54:46] and I hope I can put this together where
[54:49] you'll understand it tonight it's it's
[54:51] just kind of moving around and and so
[54:54] you just kind of have to grab a hold of
[54:56] some of these things as I preach them
[54:57] but he said one time he said about the
[54:59] third poll how it would come by this one
[55:01] way he said then by knowing the heart
[55:03] and then the spoken word so it's a sign
[55:04] of the hand it was uh knowing the heart
[55:07] and then the spoken word and he quotes
[55:09] John 14 and 12 and then he said when we
[55:12] hear the symphony beating changing
[55:14] fixing to change it's a junction time we
[55:16] notice as we begin to beat we've seen
[55:18] the works that I do so you do also and
[55:20] greater shall you do greater he promised
[55:23] it we wondered how it could be
[55:26] and brother Brandon sits there and
[55:27] wondered about that for years
[55:29] how that could be
[55:31] and he talks about then he begins
[55:33] talking about Jesus how he turned water
[55:35] into wine now that's a great work
[55:38] that's a great work he turned water into
[55:40] wine and so when he did that he took
[55:44] water which could potentially have been
[55:46] wine in fact that water was probably
[55:48] going to be used for wine
[55:50] that they used and they were they but
[55:52] they just hadn't made it but he took the
[55:55] quote something had the potential of
[55:57] becoming wine and made one he skipped
[55:59] the process brother said it was a type
[56:01] of the Resurrection
[56:03] right because that's what happens but
[56:05] this isn't just Resurrection time
[56:06] because every age went down
[56:08] understanding and believing in a
[56:10] resurrection but this is the hour of the
[56:12] rapture
[56:13] so there's something greater that comes
[56:16] to us so then he talks about feeding the
[56:18] five thousand he said he took uh two
[56:20] fish and five loaves of bread or
[56:21] whatever that it was and he took a
[56:23] little boy's lunch and he he makes out
[56:25] of that little boy's lunch something
[56:27] that would uh that that would feed five
[56:30] thousand people now that's miraculous
[56:32] that's a paradox
[56:34] but it was the potential was in there
[56:37] yeah right but but he just bypassed the
[56:40] process
[56:42] right and so now now the 5000 was fed
[56:47] but he makes his point he said but in
[56:49] the woods so it's nothing there to make
[56:50] a squirrel
[56:52] let there be in their wants without
[56:54] anything to break it from what is it the
[56:57] same Jesus Christ
[56:59] greater things than this will you do if
[57:01] I go to my father not to take something
[57:03] that's been created break something from
[57:05] it and multiply a creation but
[57:07] absolutely create
[57:11] it's good now you understand why I'm CR
[57:14] to absolutely create and again you go
[57:16] back to questions and answers I keep
[57:18] beating this over and over again because
[57:19] a lot of times it gets us feeling down
[57:21] because we say well I can't just speak
[57:23] and things happen
[57:24] I've been speaking for years or nothing
[57:26] you know
[57:27] yeah you can feel that way brother
[57:29] Brandon said it had to be at the right
[57:30] time the right place the right approach
[57:32] had to be inspired of God
[57:36] right and so a lot of times what faith
[57:38] looks like in the real world is not
[57:40] somebody walking out here and saying
[57:41] boom I speak to you and boom I speak to
[57:44] you but it's working your job and doing
[57:46] what what God requires and coming to
[57:48] church and and putting up with people
[57:50] and and doing the little things that
[57:53] make it make life seem so so mundane but
[57:55] when you get to the end of it you
[57:56] realize somehow God kept me somehow God
[57:59] made that work some how God fed the 5
[58:02] 000 or however many kids you got somehow
[58:04] God did that
[58:07] right
[58:08] and yet but you were doing all you could
[58:11] do
[58:12] so you're not just you're not just
[58:13] pouring or or Pie in the Sky somewhere
[58:17] you're not just pouring all your hopes
[58:18] and dreams into well someday God's gonna
[58:20] move for me but you're doing everything
[58:22] you know how to do
[58:24] listen if you want to stay on fire for
[58:26] God I know how easy it is to get back
[58:28] sitting cold if you want to stay on fire
[58:30] for God you've got to do your part
[58:33] you've got I know we're the elect of God
[58:35] listen if you're safe you can't do
[58:37] nothing to be unsafe but you can get
[58:39] cold on God and I'd rather live on fire
[58:41] for God than I would being cold on God
[58:44] all the time well because I love him
[58:46] that tells me I am the elect of God I am
[58:48] a I am a born-again child of God and so
[58:51] I want to be on fire for God I want to
[58:53] feel the presence of God I want to know
[58:55] that he's here if you want to feel the
[58:57] presence of God you've got to do your
[58:59] part in the house of God you got to do
[59:01] your part to live for God you're going
[59:03] to do your part to read your Bible you
[59:05] got to do your part to pray that's the
[59:07] part we do but we can't do the
[59:09] Supernatural part he's the one who warms
[59:11] the heart
[59:13] right
[59:15] so it applies the same thing applies now
[59:20] showing he's the same Jehovah
[59:23] I hope we can just kind of enter in I
[59:25] know it's hard on a Wednesday night
[59:27] it's hard sometimes
[59:29] I
[59:31] I'm not rebuking you okay
[59:35] Wednesday nights are hard I
[59:37] I saw the video pan because I've got a
[59:40] screen in my office
[59:42] well the video paying the audience I
[59:44] thought oh goodness it's gonna be a
[59:46] gonna be plowing tonight
[59:49] and I'm glad you're here it's hard isn't
[59:51] it
[59:52] I'm a church you're tired some of y'all
[59:54] about got killed this week
[59:59] yeah it's hard it's difficult
[1:00:01] and working out in the Heat and not
[1:00:03] today praise God
[1:00:05] but the the God you know there's just so
[1:00:08] many things that happen and you've been
[1:00:10] taking care of your kids are in school
[1:00:12] now and many of them are and now or
[1:00:14] you're homeschool and sometimes it's
[1:00:16] worse and
[1:00:17] and you're tired and you're weary and
[1:00:20] you don't you know
[1:00:22] if you could just enter in for a minute
[1:00:26] if we could just walk in if we had the
[1:00:28] if we had the holy of holies here with
[1:00:30] us today you know the Old Testament in
[1:00:32] the Old Testament in the temple there
[1:00:34] was the Holy holiest place and behind it
[1:00:36] was behind Badger skins and if you went
[1:00:39] in behind the veil if you had the
[1:00:40] opportunity to take a step behind the
[1:00:42] veil and just walk back there brother
[1:00:44] Bill and I'm just going to shut myself
[1:00:47] in and be in the presence of the shoe
[1:00:49] brand be in the presence of the art be
[1:00:51] in the presence of the Shekinah Glory if
[1:00:53] you could do that tonight wouldn't you
[1:00:55] take advantage of that opportunity
[1:00:58] you wouldn't pass it up we went the
[1:01:00] other day to uh to uh Eureka Springs and
[1:01:03] and the passion play wasn't going that
[1:01:05] day but I went to the Bible Museum and I
[1:01:06] really enjoyed that but I was kind of
[1:01:08] disappointed I didn't go get to go in
[1:01:10] the model of the Tabernacle and those
[1:01:12] things because they didn't have a tour
[1:01:13] when we were there I was kind of
[1:01:14] disappointed in that but how much more
[1:01:16] if I if I could go in the real thing
[1:01:18] Brother David if I could walk in and
[1:01:20] shut the door behind me and and just be
[1:01:23] in the presence of God don't you realize
[1:01:25] you can do that tonight don't you
[1:01:27] realize that's what we're here for that
[1:01:29] we can walk into the presence of the
[1:01:31] almighty God and shut the door behind us
[1:01:33] and I'm going to forget about my work
[1:01:35] I'm gonna forget about my family
[1:01:36] everything else and I'm just gonna Lord
[1:01:39] speak to me tonight let me be in your
[1:01:42] presence let me worship you
[1:01:45] amen
[1:01:46] oh it's hard but let's just
[1:01:48] let's just enter in for a minute
[1:01:52] it's the same Jehovah
[1:01:54] that stood back there and said let there
[1:01:56] be
[1:01:57] there was
[1:01:59] word was made manifest when he was made
[1:02:02] Flesh on Earth he took his original
[1:02:03] creation broke it back and multiplied it
[1:02:06] but now in the last days
[1:02:09] when he comes down among us again the
[1:02:11] same light that moved down and said let
[1:02:12] there be light see he he just
[1:02:15] speak the creation into existence
[1:02:18] is it greater than this will you do for
[1:02:20] I go to my father remember we're at
[1:02:22] these times
[1:02:25] now you see those Greater Works well
[1:02:26] that was for brother Branham what
[1:02:28] brother Branham said I read it to you
[1:02:30] Sunday when the bride realizes that she
[1:02:33] can do the Greater Works
[1:02:35] go look it up I'm not changing that when
[1:02:38] the bride realized she can do the
[1:02:39] greater work she will be an invincible
[1:02:42] Army
[1:02:43] because she can do Hallelujah
[1:02:46] she can do the Greater Works which means
[1:02:48] that the power of the spoken word will
[1:02:51] be in her
[1:02:52] again we're we're you're thinking up
[1:02:54] here you're not realizing what God's
[1:02:57] already doing in your life in this day
[1:03:00] Acts 16-31
[1:03:02] look here's another promise what
[1:03:04] attitude do we have towards this they
[1:03:06] said believe on the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:03:08] thou should be saved in thy house I want
[1:03:11] to challenge you tonight what attitude
[1:03:13] do you take
[1:03:14] towards acts 16 and 31 right
[1:03:18] now whatever you have need of or God is
[1:03:21] able to provide it how many believe that
[1:03:23] tonight
[1:03:24] there's a story uh that brother Branham
[1:03:27] he begins to tell and he's had a house
[1:03:30] and
[1:03:31] and he's talking to some friends of his
[1:03:34] and and they're sitting in the living
[1:03:36] room and at the table sits the brother
[1:03:38] right and and and a couple of other
[1:03:41] brothers and over here sitsa
[1:03:44] how do you write somebody's car is going
[1:03:46] off and over here is happy right it's
[1:03:49] all right the battery will run down
[1:03:50] after a while
[1:03:52] but
[1:03:53] don't everybody try it once
[1:03:56] but on one side was on one side was
[1:03:58] Hattie Wright and on the other side on
[1:04:00] the other side was uh was Edith her
[1:04:03] sister that was you remember the story
[1:04:05] her sister that was sick
[1:04:08] and so you've got a you've got a
[1:04:11] situation
[1:04:12] where uh you've got a situation where
[1:04:15] they're seated in the living room and
[1:04:18] and the prophet is talking he's just
[1:04:21] telling stories
[1:04:23] and what the first story that he tells
[1:04:25] is about Jehovah Jireh he said that when
[1:04:28] Abraham was up in the in the mountains
[1:04:31] said there was a there was a he needed a
[1:04:33] ram because he God had told him to
[1:04:35] sacrifice his only son and he knew his
[1:04:37] son would have to be the the his seed
[1:04:40] that was only that was the promise God
[1:04:41] gave him so there had to be a something
[1:04:43] offered in his Stead
[1:04:45] and so we provided something a ram where
[1:04:48] there could be nothing
[1:04:50] right
[1:04:51] everybody's still with me now
[1:04:53] so he provided a ram when when there
[1:04:56] could be nothing there in a place where
[1:04:58] there could be no RAM and so brother
[1:05:00] random relation he says I was in the
[1:05:02] woods he said and there was a uh there
[1:05:05] was a squirrel he said God spoke to me
[1:05:08] and talked to me about these scriptures
[1:05:09] and there was no squirrels there and I
[1:05:12] was in a sycamore Thicket I believe that
[1:05:13] he said a place where there would be no
[1:05:14] squirrels and he said I I was sitting
[1:05:17] there and he said all of a sudden there
[1:05:19] was one and he shot it and he told the
[1:05:21] story and when he got done telling the
[1:05:23] story or as he was telling the story
[1:05:25] sister Hattie sitting over by the wall
[1:05:28] in the living room and she makes a
[1:05:31] statement she said that's nothing but
[1:05:33] the truth
[1:05:35] all right you've all heard the story
[1:05:38] and I'd have love to admit sister Hattie
[1:05:40] and ask her exactly how that went down
[1:05:42] but the random relates it a few times
[1:05:44] the brother Bill told me he met sister
[1:05:46] Hattie Wright some of you kids these
[1:05:48] sound like really old stories brother
[1:05:50] Bill met sister Hattie right
[1:05:53] and and she was a real woman that lived
[1:05:56] and
[1:05:57] and she was a poor woman
[1:05:59] but now when she said that
[1:06:02] all of a sudden brother Brown talked
[1:06:04] about that presence of God dropping in
[1:06:06] on him
[1:06:08] and I could read you the quotes we don't
[1:06:09] have time tonight that presence of God
[1:06:11] dropped in on him he began to he began
[1:06:14] to uh begin to tell her he said the
[1:06:17] spirit of the Lord told her tell her to
[1:06:19] ask for what she needs
[1:06:21] say what she needs and give it to her
[1:06:26] and so he tells her he says he says what
[1:06:29] do you have need of ask whatever he said
[1:06:31] whatever you ask for God will give you
[1:06:33] and she said what should I ask and he
[1:06:35] said well here's your sister that's
[1:06:37] crippled and my brother ran up at one
[1:06:39] place in that story he says that he says
[1:06:41] when she said it's nothing but the truth
[1:06:42] at the same time he said sister right
[1:06:44] her mother was trying to get Edith or
[1:06:47] trying to uh trying to relate what Edith
[1:06:49] was saying trying to translate what
[1:06:51] Edith was trying to say and so there was
[1:06:53] more than one voice in the room but he
[1:06:54] said The only voice that I heard was
[1:06:56] hers
[1:06:57] well look it up I believe God hears our
[1:07:00] Voice tonight
[1:07:01] I believe he hears your voice
[1:07:03] so he they're they're sitting there
[1:07:05] around the table she says it's nothing
[1:07:07] but the truth he says whatever you have
[1:07:09] need of and he said here's your sister
[1:07:10] sitting here that's been sick all over
[1:07:12] her life he said if you speak she'll be
[1:07:14] well
[1:07:15] here here you need money you don't have
[1:07:18] any money and you're you're trying to
[1:07:19] make it as a widow he said he said to
[1:07:22] you and oh my yeah you could have money
[1:07:26] you could speak it it would be there
[1:07:29] a new home a new car whatever it would
[1:07:31] be
[1:07:32] but brother random taught us that God
[1:07:34] chose her because she would ask for the
[1:07:36] right thing
[1:07:39] and the right thing was the salvation of
[1:07:41] her children he said we're standing over
[1:07:43] in the corner laughing at what he was
[1:07:46] saying
[1:07:48] Oh my he said they've gotten to be about
[1:07:50] 15 16 years old and they were standing
[1:07:53] there Snicker and laughing about what he
[1:07:54] had to say and as they were standing
[1:07:56] there he said and she said I want the
[1:07:58] salvation of my children
[1:08:01] and when he and he responded I give them
[1:08:03] to you in the name of the Lord and
[1:08:04] immediately they fell down and began to
[1:08:07] repent
[1:08:10] what was that
[1:08:12] right that was God keeping his word
[1:08:16] and and now but watch watch what it was
[1:08:19] it was her attitude and her approach to
[1:08:22] the prophet
[1:08:23] it was her saying the right thing
[1:08:26] right and again you might say well it's
[1:08:28] just for brother random look what
[1:08:29] brother Brandon says later in the sermon
[1:08:31] he tells that in first was my new
[1:08:32] ministry in 1959 and he says this he
[1:08:35] said now every one of you not only
[1:08:37] ministers but all of you ought to pray
[1:08:38] for these people he said you don't know
[1:08:40] what God might do for you while you pray
[1:08:43] for somebody else
[1:08:46] you don't know what God might do for you
[1:08:48] while you pray for somebody else
[1:08:51] now brother Branham encouraged
[1:08:52] congregational prayer at times in the
[1:08:55] services he said he would say this he'd
[1:08:57] say God can hear you he hears he said
[1:08:59] there's millions of prayers going up all
[1:09:01] over the world he said so you pray like
[1:09:02] you do in your church I'm sure you've
[1:09:04] heard him say that you pray like you do
[1:09:06] in your church he said because God hears
[1:09:09] prayers from all over the world he hears
[1:09:11] you
[1:09:12] oh what a comforting thought that is but
[1:09:15] he would encourage people to pray
[1:09:16] together I think sometimes we need to
[1:09:18] hear our own voice even if nobody else
[1:09:20] hears it we need to hear ourselves say
[1:09:23] it's nothing but the truth we need to
[1:09:25] hear ourselves say Amen you say brother
[1:09:27] man I'm not in a manner but you need to
[1:09:28] hear it as much as I need to hear it
[1:09:32] you need to hear yourself obey the word
[1:09:34] you need it you need to see yourself
[1:09:36] obey the word you need to hear yourself
[1:09:37] amen the word
[1:09:41] so it may be just quiet and maybe all
[1:09:43] you can get out is just a boy man maybe
[1:09:45] I would never hear it but you heard
[1:09:47] yourself say it
[1:09:49] he said it's nothing but the truth and
[1:09:51] somehow in the confusion of that room
[1:09:53] the prophet of God heard her
[1:09:56] yeah oh God
[1:09:58] so now but he said he said you don't
[1:10:00] know what God might do for you while you
[1:10:02] pray for somebody else what if you'd say
[1:10:03] the right thing
[1:10:05] he said here's a woman standing here
[1:10:06] that's so sick to have to hold her up
[1:10:07] what if your prayer would be the right
[1:10:09] thing just like Bank said the right
[1:10:11] thing like caddy said the right thing
[1:10:12] when we gather together so what if our
[1:10:14] prayer could be the say the right thing
[1:10:16] for brother JT or one of these other
[1:10:18] people that are sick or in need what if
[1:10:20] our prayer could be the right thing for
[1:10:22] our children that they would come home
[1:10:25] reach
[1:10:27] oh you hearing me tonight
[1:10:29] what if you would say you say brother
[1:10:30] brother Ben I'm not much of a prayer
[1:10:32] Warrior but if you can just get those
[1:10:34] those sounds out the words that he can
[1:10:36] put them together
[1:10:37] it's like the little boy was praying his
[1:10:39] ABCs he said I believe God can put it
[1:10:41] together
[1:10:47] then what if your prayer would be the
[1:10:48] right thing
[1:10:49] what if you would say the right thing
[1:10:51] your prayer to cause God to come down
[1:10:54] and do something
[1:10:55] see this is just not one person this is
[1:10:58] the Church of the Living God everybody
[1:11:01] oh my
[1:11:03] God what about our attitude towards this
[1:11:05] promise and I trust me it all goes
[1:11:07] together in some way or another
[1:11:10] first Thessalonians 4 16 for the Lord
[1:11:12] himself
[1:11:13] shall descend from heaven with a shout
[1:11:15] with the voice of the Archangel with the
[1:11:17] Trump of God the dead in Christ shall
[1:11:19] rise first then we which are alive and
[1:11:21] remain shall be caught up together with
[1:11:22] them in the clouds and meet the Lord in
[1:11:24] the air and so shall we ever be with the
[1:11:25] Lord what is our attitude towards that
[1:11:27] promise what do we preach on Sunday this
[1:11:29] message was a Rapture message so our
[1:11:31] attitude towards that scripture is our
[1:11:34] attitude towards the message of the hour
[1:11:39] brother Branham ties this
[1:11:41] spoken word Hattie right ties it over to
[1:11:45] the rapture
[1:11:47] and he said Jesus said say to this
[1:11:49] mountain and you've heard about what's
[1:11:51] been taken place that's the ministry
[1:11:53] we're entering into we're way up the
[1:11:55] road now
[1:11:56] soon the coming of the Lord Jesus and
[1:11:59] we've got to have rapturing faith in a
[1:12:02] church that can be changed in a moment
[1:12:04] in a twinkling of an eye to go out or
[1:12:07] will not go
[1:12:09] say well that's concerns me brother Ben
[1:12:11] I'm not sure but he said but don't worry
[1:12:13] it'll be there
[1:12:15] I love that
[1:12:17] there will be a bride without spot or
[1:12:19] wrinkle there will be a people that will
[1:12:22] that will grab a hold of Faith at the
[1:12:24] right time
[1:12:25] and you might sit there brother Ben I
[1:12:27] don't even have faith for nothing right
[1:12:28] now but listen at the right time if
[1:12:30] you're the bride God will give it to you
[1:12:32] yeah somehow you'll have the faith to
[1:12:34] speak
[1:12:35] you'll have a part in that
[1:12:38] now
[1:12:41] I want to ask then as I've come a long
[1:12:44] ways and I'm almost out of time but I
[1:12:47] want to quickly go into this what kind
[1:12:48] of an attitude did the woman with the
[1:12:50] blood disease
[1:12:51] Martha and Hattie Wright have in common
[1:12:55] there's an attitude of humble
[1:12:56] expectation
[1:13:00] humble expectation
[1:13:02] they did not approach the word with an
[1:13:05] attitude of entitlement
[1:13:08] God you owe this to me
[1:13:12] brother Brandon talks about the Spanish
[1:13:13] people and
[1:13:15] and he says you're humble
[1:13:17] you're willing to eat or just take the
[1:13:19] crumbs whatever he said you come in that
[1:13:21] attitude that's the reason you get
[1:13:22] healed
[1:13:24] that's the reason you're healed because
[1:13:25] you come humble
[1:13:27] anyone who comes stiff-necked will never
[1:13:29] receive nothing from God say God help me
[1:13:31] to come humble
[1:13:33] he said you've got to see how low you
[1:13:34] can get and then Christ will heal you
[1:13:36] that's right or he will save you that
[1:13:38] was in 1948 again in 1961 brother
[1:13:41] Brandon says I just he said I'm trying
[1:13:43] to dodge an issue here I'm going to say
[1:13:44] it he said my last meeting at Tucson
[1:13:46] Arizona three or four nights ago I seen
[1:13:48] the white people come in there starchy
[1:13:50] Pentecostal
[1:13:52] starchy as they could be
[1:13:54] I've seen some poor old Mexicans comes
[1:13:57] in there they was there that morning
[1:13:58] when I spoke at the morning service he
[1:14:00] said they sit right in that church all
[1:14:01] day long from nine o'clock about the
[1:14:03] morning until eight o'clock about seven
[1:14:05] o'clock or eight when they come in they
[1:14:06] sit and stayed right around in that
[1:14:07] church until that evening and when it
[1:14:09] come time when the Holy Spirit dropped
[1:14:11] in among the building who got healed
[1:14:14] said the Spanish the Mexicans
[1:14:17] the Holy Spirit going right out through
[1:14:19] the audience and raising up the sick and
[1:14:21] Afflicted and everything like that
[1:14:22] bringing around Spanish humble now this
[1:14:24] isn't racism I I think we're all
[1:14:26] Americans here tonight
[1:14:28] yeah
[1:14:30] we're pretty American
[1:14:32] but if we could come humbly in spite of
[1:14:35] our americanness
[1:14:39] said come expect
[1:14:41] the world just look at I've related to
[1:14:43] you many times how the people come and
[1:14:44] how they approach the meeting overseas
[1:14:47] and what a difference it makes in the
[1:14:49] services
[1:14:50] brother random and we talked about the
[1:14:53] Germans and the Swiss and he's over in
[1:14:55] Germany or in Switzerland actually
[1:14:57] preaching and he said I noticed a Swiss
[1:15:00] he said the Swiss never had no trouble
[1:15:03] they're like Americans fined fed
[1:15:06] praise God
[1:15:08] I said my just as cocky
[1:15:11] said if you'll excuse the expression we
[1:15:13] are so-and-so we are the swing lights
[1:15:16] we're Lutheran we don't have to listen
[1:15:18] to that stuff
[1:15:19] and then poor old Germans all beat down
[1:15:21] so we counted 180 busloads them big
[1:15:25] glass top buffaloes come into where
[1:15:27] there's about 50 000 gathered together
[1:15:29] there in the big arena
[1:15:30] this was less than 10 years after World
[1:15:32] War II
[1:15:33] you can imagine their cities were
[1:15:36] destroyed their lives were destroyed
[1:15:37] their government was upending millions
[1:15:39] of them were killed
[1:15:40] and not only that the Christians
[1:15:42] themselves have been persecuted under
[1:15:44] Hitler the Evangelical Christians had
[1:15:46] just been he tried to destroy him put in
[1:15:49] death camps and everything else
[1:15:51] and go read about ones that stood
[1:15:53] against him and and some of the things
[1:15:54] that went on during that time it was a
[1:15:56] terrible time for the church
[1:15:58] they'd have probably told you it was the
[1:16:00] end times
[1:16:01] they didn't probably told you it was
[1:16:03] Armageddon
[1:16:04] because that's what it felt like to them
[1:16:06] but they've been through that and it
[1:16:08] produced a humility in their life
[1:16:11] he said what happened he said when the
[1:16:13] Holy Spirit began to fall everyone out
[1:16:14] there was the Germans that he called
[1:16:16] oh my left them sitting right where they
[1:16:19] were sitting
[1:16:20] talking about the Swiss still in their
[1:16:23] sickness still in their sin set right
[1:16:25] there and healed the Germans that come
[1:16:26] with expectations and arms out
[1:16:30] he said they'd been beat down to a place
[1:16:32] them Christians up there under Hitler
[1:16:34] and them had been beat to a place so
[1:16:35] they had to look to God for mercy he
[1:16:38] said oh God knows how to do things he
[1:16:41] said friends watch don't let it be you
[1:16:42] you come with expectations be ready lay
[1:16:45] aside every little weight that so easily
[1:16:47] beset you and come humble in heart
[1:16:49] expecting God to keep his word and he
[1:16:52] will do it amen I mean believe that
[1:16:54] tonight
[1:16:58] when we come with a
[1:17:00] arrogance
[1:17:02] don't get nothing from God
[1:17:05] that's just the truth
[1:17:07] first Peter five and six listen to how
[1:17:08] Peter puts it humble yourselves
[1:17:10] therefore unto the mighty hand of God
[1:17:13] that he may exalt you in due time
[1:17:16] casting all your care upon him so it's
[1:17:18] humility with expectation one doesn't
[1:17:21] work without the other
[1:17:23] humility with Biblical hope which is
[1:17:25] expectation casting all your care upon
[1:17:27] him for heareth for you
[1:17:30] Martha met him look at her attitude she
[1:17:32] went up there looked like she had a
[1:17:33] right to upgrade him
[1:17:35] she had a right to get mad at the
[1:17:37] preacher
[1:17:38] right because brother Brown said when he
[1:17:39] found out last the Lord told him that
[1:17:41] Lazarus was going to get sick he left
[1:17:45] said when the father told you to go look
[1:17:47] it up when the father told Jesus that
[1:17:48] last was going to get sick Jesus left
[1:17:52] and he was gone the whole time he was
[1:17:53] sick
[1:17:54] they didn't know where he went
[1:17:56] until they sent somebody to find him
[1:17:58] but now look at her attitude and he
[1:18:00] didn't come back until he was already
[1:18:01] dead
[1:18:03] and she went up there looked like she
[1:18:04] had a right to raid him but she didn't
[1:18:06] if she would the story would never have
[1:18:08] been told she fell down at his feet she
[1:18:12] said Lord that's what he was if thou
[1:18:14] would have been here my brother would
[1:18:15] not have died
[1:18:17] see but I know now yet he's dead four
[1:18:20] days the skin worms is done crawling in
[1:18:23] the nose has fell in
[1:18:25] if you'd have been here my brother would
[1:18:26] not have died but even now how many
[1:18:29] believe that tonight no matter what
[1:18:30] situation you're in no matter how bad it
[1:18:32] looks no matter no matter how rough it
[1:18:34] may seem even now
[1:18:37] even now even at my age even even in my
[1:18:40] situation even in my with my trouble
[1:18:42] even with my family even now
[1:18:45] oh hope we can grab a hold of that
[1:18:47] tonight even now you could do it Lord
[1:18:49] even now anything is possible even now
[1:18:53] everything's gonna be okay
[1:18:56] hey man if you'd have been there my
[1:18:58] brother would not have died but even now
[1:18:59] whatever you ask God God will give it to
[1:19:01] you that's the way to come he said see
[1:19:03] humble
[1:19:05] so it's humble expectation
[1:19:08] we just see the same attitude and
[1:19:09] approach with another woman that brother
[1:19:11] Brown sometimes uses in the same
[1:19:12] situation that's a gentile woman or the
[1:19:15] sour Phoenician woman
[1:19:16] and she come to Jesus and ask for
[1:19:19] healing for her daughter she's not even
[1:19:21] asking for herself and Jesus said it's
[1:19:23] not meat for me to take the children's
[1:19:25] bread and give it to dogs
[1:19:27] it's not appropriate for me to heal your
[1:19:30] daughter
[1:19:31] and she comes back and says that's the
[1:19:33] truth Lord
[1:19:35] but the little dogs
[1:19:37] eat the crumbs that fall from the
[1:19:39] master's table
[1:19:41] and you say well that I I don't want to
[1:19:43] be no little dog hey go ask our dog how
[1:19:45] that life is pretty good
[1:19:51] he just sits there and eats the crumbs
[1:19:52] that fall from the master's table and he
[1:19:54] runs around he that little thing's as
[1:19:56] fat as he can be
[1:19:58] why because all he he don't have to hope
[1:20:00] for himself he don't have to go out and
[1:20:02] Chase a rabbit dog we got a rabbit dog
[1:20:04] and a rabbit that's our two pets
[1:20:07] and and he he might have to hunt for a
[1:20:11] living he might have to if you set him
[1:20:12] out he said let him go free he'd die but
[1:20:15] when he can eat the crumbs from the
[1:20:16] master's table he's all right
[1:20:18] oh I'd rather be eating the crumbs from
[1:20:20] the master's table than to be the
[1:20:22] biggest dog in the bunch
[1:20:24] are you with me now
[1:20:27] he'd rather be there than the best
[1:20:28] kennel in the country
[1:20:31] amen listen she didn't say she didn't
[1:20:34] say you have to come down to my house
[1:20:36] and lay your hands on my child
[1:20:39] she didn't say if you would come down
[1:20:41] and speak in another language out yonder
[1:20:42] tell me all about it I'll believe it
[1:20:44] listen we got to be careful what we how
[1:20:47] we approach God
[1:20:49] I know sometimes we approach him as if
[1:20:51] well the Lord better speak to me if he
[1:20:53] doesn't speak to me if he doesn't
[1:20:54] directly speak to me in a way that says
[1:20:57] Ben this is you
[1:20:59] wake up
[1:21:01] then that he didn't do his job
[1:21:03] no God is already spoken
[1:21:06] maybe he's waiting on us to listen
[1:21:10] she didn't say if you'll come down and
[1:21:12] speak in another language tell me all
[1:21:14] about it I'll believe it she said I only
[1:21:15] want the crumbs just the awful it's all
[1:21:17] I'm looking for see she had the right
[1:21:19] approach she had the right approach to
[1:21:21] God's gift she was the first Gentile
[1:21:23] that Jesus ever done a miracle on faith
[1:21:25] always admits the word is right and
[1:21:28] Faith always acts humble
[1:21:30] we believe that tonight
[1:21:32] but it's humility with expectations see
[1:21:35] you've got to expect God to do what he
[1:21:37] does
[1:21:39] the woman with the blood issue was
[1:21:41] expecting
[1:21:42] he said If She Could Touch the Hem of
[1:21:44] His Garment it was over
[1:21:45] when she touched the Hem of His Garment
[1:21:47] her expectations were fulfilled if you
[1:21:50] come tonight expecting to be healed
[1:21:52] you're going to be healed if you come
[1:21:54] tonight expecting to find something to
[1:21:55] criticize the meeting you'll certainly
[1:21:57] find it
[1:21:58] you get what you come for
[1:22:01] again the woman that touched him of His
[1:22:03] Garment was expecting God to keep his
[1:22:04] word Martha was expecting God to keep
[1:22:07] his word when he said I am the
[1:22:08] resurrection of life
[1:22:11] and yet we think about this and then the
[1:22:13] more you think about it because
[1:22:15] in our sense when we think about being
[1:22:16] humble and we begin to think about who
[1:22:18] we are and what we deserve which isn't
[1:22:21] much and we begin to think well I'm not
[1:22:23] worthy how many have ever thought that
[1:22:26] I'm not worthy to come to God
[1:22:28] I'm not worthy to go into the throne
[1:22:30] room brother Ben when you talked about
[1:22:32] the going into the inner chamber to the
[1:22:35] holy of holies I wouldn't go in I'd be
[1:22:36] afraid I'd Die
[1:22:38] well that's right you wouldn't go in by
[1:22:40] yourself
[1:22:43] but look what it says give me that that
[1:22:44] next slide look what it says in Hebrews
[1:22:47] in Hebrews 4 14 seeing then
[1:22:50] that we have a great high priest
[1:22:52] that is passed into the heavens Jesus
[1:22:55] the son of God let us hold fast our
[1:22:58] profession
[1:23:00] verse 15 for we have nodded high priest
[1:23:02] which cannot be touched with the feeling
[1:23:04] of our infirmities
[1:23:06] oh thank God but was in all points
[1:23:09] tempted like as we are yet without sin
[1:23:11] we are not worthy but he is
[1:23:13] we failed but he stood the test
[1:23:16] we we have failed many times to do what
[1:23:19] we ought to do but if we come humbly
[1:23:21] before him we can also come boldly
[1:23:23] before him
[1:23:25] look what he says verse 16 let us
[1:23:27] therefore come boldly unto the throne of
[1:23:30] grace
[1:23:31] that we may obtain Mercy
[1:23:33] and find Grace to help in time of need
[1:23:37] that word boldly is with confidence
[1:23:40] come with humble confidence humble
[1:23:42] expectation to one who has been through
[1:23:44] the same temptations that we've been
[1:23:46] through and he did not fall so he stands
[1:23:49] in our place and allows us to make our
[1:23:51] petition
[1:23:53] to a high priest that can be touched
[1:23:55] oh my
[1:23:57] oh my
[1:23:58] that's what the little woman knew he
[1:24:01] could be touched
[1:24:02] and how many times did Brother Branham
[1:24:04] stand in the platform and he said what
[1:24:06] did she touch what did he touch what was
[1:24:08] he saying he was saying the physical
[1:24:10] Lord Jesus is not here so you can Touch
[1:24:12] the Hem of His Garment but by faith you
[1:24:14] touch the word
[1:24:16] and when you touch him today he is still
[1:24:18] able to heal you he's still able to
[1:24:21] reveal the secrets of your heart
[1:24:24] amen
[1:24:26] listen
[1:24:27] Abraham says our heavenly father he's
[1:24:29] praying then we bow in Humble worship
[1:24:32] to express to you the very adorations of
[1:24:34] our heart oh how we are elated tonight
[1:24:37] Lord to feel your blessings moving in
[1:24:40] our mortal beings
[1:24:44] few moments I love this
[1:24:47] humble expectation
[1:24:50] expecting in a few moments to see the
[1:24:53] vital the real presence of Jesus Christ
[1:24:55] moving among the people giving them
[1:24:58] Faith seeing great signs and wonders
[1:25:00] take place
[1:25:01] so we come humbly
[1:25:03] expecting great things
[1:25:06] you come with the right approach you're
[1:25:08] able to get what you asked for
[1:25:11] right Jesus even said that the woman who
[1:25:14] didn't deserve remember the unjust judge
[1:25:17] and the woman he didn't give it to her
[1:25:18] because of the merits of her case
[1:25:20] she come knocking she bothered him so
[1:25:23] much that he gave it to her
[1:25:25] God is Not unjust and we are not a widow
[1:25:28] woman we are married to Christ the word
[1:25:31] are you with me now but Jesus uses that
[1:25:34] extreme example he said even the widow
[1:25:36] woman come knocking and the judge just
[1:25:37] gave it to her
[1:25:39] because she come with the right approach
[1:25:41] so we come expecting great things
[1:25:43] I was in the fellowship Paul Sunday and
[1:25:46] Elaine's not here tonight my niece and
[1:25:48] she come up behind me and I'm sitting
[1:25:50] there talking to somebody she come up
[1:25:51] behind me and said Uncle Ben can I have
[1:25:54] two dollars
[1:25:55] and I took out my wallet and I got two
[1:25:57] dollars out and I put it over my
[1:25:59] shoulder I gave it to her and she walked
[1:26:01] away and about five minutes later it
[1:26:03] occurred to me she was not my child
[1:26:09] oh
[1:26:11] all right should come with confidence
[1:26:17] right so humbly it's not just well I'm
[1:26:19] afraid to ask no humble you she wasn't
[1:26:22] asking the bank

[1:26:37] was coming somebody she knew
[1:26:39] so she could come boldly
[1:26:41] yeah
[1:26:42] you come I heard a story y'all forgive
[1:26:46] me I heard a story the other day on the
[1:26:47] radio and this guy said that he had been
[1:26:49] counseling some people financially and
[1:26:51] and they said they had a they had a uh a
[1:26:55] 1200 car payment on 2600 of income he
[1:26:58] said well the first thing you do is you
[1:27:00] need to get rid of the car
[1:27:02] he said why can't the lord gave me the
[1:27:04] car
[1:27:06] he said well
[1:27:08] he said how do you know the lord gave
[1:27:10] you the car he said because he said the
[1:27:12] finance manager told me it was a miracle
[1:27:13] that I got approved
[1:27:18] right lord gave me the car
[1:27:20] well
[1:27:22] I want you to I want you to think
[1:27:24] spiritually now
[1:27:25] when you come before God
[1:27:28] your credit is good with God
[1:27:31] you're not coming before the bank you're
[1:27:33] coming before your father
[1:27:35] you're coming for somebody you have a
[1:27:37] relationship with you're coming before
[1:27:39] somebody that all you have to do is ask
[1:27:41] and he'll give it to you
[1:27:43] and you wouldn't ask for nothing you
[1:27:45] shouldn't have because you've got the
[1:27:47] right attitude if you don't you need to
[1:27:48] get the right attitude
[1:27:50] so you come home humbly expecting great
[1:27:53] things
[1:27:54] a woman one time pressed to the crowd
[1:27:56] and touched His Garment and felt within
[1:27:57] herself that she was healed and went out
[1:27:59] and sat in the crowd Jesus said who
[1:28:01] touched me Peter rebuked him but he said
[1:28:03] I perceive that virtue of strength has
[1:28:05] gone from me he looked around over the
[1:28:07] audience until he found the little woman
[1:28:08] until she told us she had a blood issue
[1:28:10] and her face had saved her is that right
[1:28:12] he said well now if he's the same high
[1:28:14] priest wouldn't he do the same thing
[1:28:15] tonight if he'd be touched he said now
[1:28:18] how would he do it he's Divine now we
[1:28:21] are the branches is that right he said
[1:28:22] well then he'd act through the branch if
[1:28:25] it's a correct oh my if it's a correct
[1:28:27] Branch out of the vine it'd act the same
[1:28:29] way the life was in the vine is that
[1:28:31] right he said now you pray you believe
[1:28:34] and then he said I pray I believe
[1:28:37] so that's both ends working together you
[1:28:40] pray you believe I pray I believe and
[1:28:43] upon the stand that I've taken for God
[1:28:45] around this world he said in this
[1:28:47] ministry of discernment is now leaving
[1:28:50] you realize brother Branham was taking a
[1:28:52] step up
[1:28:53] I don't know there's people ever since
[1:28:55] then there's been a Pentecostal movement
[1:28:57] that's tried to impersonate that gift
[1:28:59] but brother random was moving was taking
[1:29:01] even a step higher although he said that
[1:29:02] gift would always be with him because he
[1:29:04] was a prophet
[1:29:05] but in his ministry he was taking a step
[1:29:07] up what was it into the opening of the
[1:29:09] word
[1:29:10] amen and the spoken word identified that
[1:29:13] as the opening of the word I hope you I
[1:29:15] hope you get it tonight he said the
[1:29:16] ministry of discernment is now leaving
[1:29:17] and I'm stepping into a higher Ministry
[1:29:19] of speaking the word and you see what
[1:29:20] God has done he's put it right back in
[1:29:23] the lap of the people
[1:29:24] let them come with the right approach
[1:29:26] and watch what happens I say to you in
[1:29:29] the name of the Lord tonight according
[1:29:30] to the word of God if you come to with
[1:29:31] the right approach I believe we are one
[1:29:33] of the branches on the vine we are not
[1:29:35] Divine but we are the branches if you
[1:29:37] come with the right approach God will
[1:29:39] heal you God will save you
[1:29:42] but he put it right back in your lap he
[1:29:44] said let them come with the right
[1:29:45] approach and watch what happens but
[1:29:47] they've got to have the right approach
[1:29:49] see no one can heal he's the Healer but
[1:29:52] I cannot say it until he speaks to me
[1:29:54] see but you can speak now
[1:29:57] how do you believe it tonight church I'm
[1:30:00] ready to close but listen you can speak
[1:30:02] now with your faith and get your healing
[1:30:05] if you believe
[1:30:09] but you do that you've got to come
[1:30:10] humbly
[1:30:12] and with expectation
[1:30:15] expecting God to do something let's use
[1:30:16] one more example as the musicians come
[1:30:18] tonight
[1:30:19] Centurion
[1:30:21] Matthew 8 8.
[1:30:23] Jesus
[1:30:25] you come to Jesus and ask if he'd heal
[1:30:28] his his servant
[1:30:31] and Jesus said yeah I'll go
[1:30:34] and he answered back
[1:30:36] the Lord
[1:30:38] I'm not worthy
[1:30:40] that thou should has come under my roof
[1:30:43] see humility
[1:30:46] right humility
[1:30:49] isn't it something a Roman Centurion
[1:30:52] that probably had the biggest house in
[1:30:53] the place
[1:30:55] he a centurion was a great man in that
[1:30:58] time
[1:30:58] head of a hundred soldiers
[1:31:00] he was a Roman citizen he would have
[1:31:03] been a man that had wealth and power and
[1:31:05] influence
[1:31:07] he was a man who carried a staff that
[1:31:10] allowed him to even beat up on Roman
[1:31:11] citizens
[1:31:13] he had that much power
[1:31:16] and and he stood there
[1:31:18] oh my when Jesus went to Simon Pharisees
[1:31:22] house they didn't even wash his feet
[1:31:24] when he went in
[1:31:25] they didn't even care that he was there
[1:31:28] but the Centurion said you're I'm not
[1:31:29] even worthy that you come to my house
[1:31:34] but speak the word expectation
[1:31:39] speak the word only
[1:31:42] said you don't have to speak it loudly
[1:31:44] you don't have to you don't have to say
[1:31:45] it in a certain tone of voice it don't
[1:31:47] have to be during Wednesday or Sunday
[1:31:48] service it doesn't just speak it
[1:31:51] don't you realize the age that we live
[1:31:53] in speak the word only and my servant
[1:31:55] shall be healed what are we waiting on
[1:31:57] for the Rapture the word has already
[1:31:58] been spoken it's our attitude towards
[1:32:01] that and by taking him at his word when
[1:32:04] the time comes we'll go home
[1:32:06] by taking him at his word when the time
[1:32:08] comes for healing will be healed by
[1:32:10] taking him at his word when the time
[1:32:12] comes amen he said well when is the time
[1:32:14] believe for it now believe for right now
[1:32:18] and when you believe for it now it won't
[1:32:20] matter if it's 25 years from now brother
[1:32:22] Joe well it'll come to pass
[1:32:26] humble EX expectation that God will
[1:32:28] fulfill if you've heard don't come
[1:32:32] casually
[1:32:34] we'll come to God casually
[1:32:36] don't teach your children that don't
[1:32:38] come lackadaisical don't come just well
[1:32:40] I'll take it or leave it that's not how
[1:32:42] we come to God we come to God with all
[1:32:44] of our heart our body our soul our mind
[1:32:47] he said love the Lord God that's all we
[1:32:49] can do we can't make it happen we can't
[1:32:51] save ourselves I can't there's nothing I
[1:32:53] can do to make myself a Christian but I
[1:32:55] can come to God in the right way and oh
[1:32:58] my my brother brother Mark if I come to
[1:33:00] God in the right way I believe even if I
[1:33:02] wasn't on the Lamb's Book of Life if I
[1:33:04] come to him the right way I'd be like
[1:33:06] that Gentile woman that I come to him in
[1:33:08] such a way that I said Lord I'm not

[1:33:13] to I'm not gonna be disappointed I'm not
[1:33:15] going to let anybody talk me out of it

[1:33:21] it into heaven because I come to you in
[1:33:23] the right way
[1:33:25] because I know there will be some there
[1:33:26] like that but I believe it's much more
