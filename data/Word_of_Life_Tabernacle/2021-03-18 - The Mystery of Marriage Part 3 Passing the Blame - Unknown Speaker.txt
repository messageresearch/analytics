isn't that always on your mind amen god bless you you could be seated for just a moment this evening and i've got just a couple things i wanted to talk about and isn't it good to be in church tonight good to see all of you here and and i see jt you made it tonight i wasn't sure you'd come with the weather and things but it looks like it cleared up for us i was looking at the forecast it looked like we were going to have some bad weather about church time and and i was looking at something brother branham had said about how the storm in colorado stopped i said lord i know you could do that for us too and we got to i got to look and there's tornadoes up in missouri and there's tornadoes in mississippi on the other side but it just kind of left arkansas out and and so i believe god can do that and if you made an effort to be here tonight there's a reason for that god wanted you to be here and and i believe if you make that effort god will bless you do you believe that god will bless you amen so good to be in the house of the lord tonight brother david did you bring your guitar tonight you don't have it well if you hear sunday would you sing for us sunday um we'll be glad to have you sing and for the howard wants to wants to help we let him sing as well i i keep coming out and seeing you guys here and i'd like to hear you sing sometime amen um i just had a couple of things we were at camp i've been in a bunch of services over the last few days so if i'm just a little bit over the top tonight you pray for me because i i don't intend to be but we've man we've been in church and i think this is the eighth service that i've been in since last wednesday night and so i didn't preach any of those since last wednesday but i got to be a part and i i'm thankful for that and we got to take peter and i want to thank you again for giving us the opportunity to go and uh and do that and i don't take that lightly and uh of course we greeted the people there for you and brother wendell and his church and some brother tim's church was there and got to spend some time with brother timothy we're old friends and got to spend some time with joe adams and different ones that were there and so i'm glad that they were there and we got to be there and peter got to fellowship and and be blessed by the services but the atmosphere was just so wonderful and and i know that god wants wants us to be free and that doesn't mean that we'll shout and and and scream every service but it does mean that we can be free and in the spirit of god we're not bound by denominationalism we're not bound by things of the world we can be free we believe in a gospel that can set you free tonight and so we don't have to be bound and and so that's it's on my heart that we would be free to worship god just any way the lord would lay on our hearts and but god's been doing some things for us i was here a few days ago on a sunday i came out here sister victoria was sitting out here on the parking lot in early and she was sitting there and i went up to her car and and she was crying she said i don't know where to bend if i'm going to be able to come here much longer because of my eyes and the condition of my eyes and and i understand that we prayed with her and i said well let's just believe god will do something about that and and uh we prayed with her and i got word that hurt she didn't have to have a shot in her eyes she'd been going having a shot every once in a while and they told her she didn't have to have that if i understood correctly and that she uh also that they didn't want to see her for a while so praise the lord for that i i believe god did that for her [Applause] i was telling brother allen sometimes it seems like the people that um that it's most rewarding to serve those in the church that can do the least for you and you'll find that's true just in life that it's most rewarding to serve people and sometimes the part that seems to be the most feeble paul says is the most necessary so we need to remember that especially with our elderly folks and i went to see brother jp yesterday and today after he got out of the hospital and kind of making up for lost time but he seems to be doing much better as well and so we appreciate your prayers i believe god did that for him god brother david white is is in branson celebrating with his family well that's a big deal because you know it not long ago he was on a deathbed in in many ways and so we thank god for that and i believe god wants to do miraculous things for us but you can't do anything for us unless we expect it from him you have to expect it if you don't expect god to be able to move in the preaching of the word and the singing or whatever if you don't come expecting then you can't get anything from god you'd be better off going to a self-help lecture somewhere but but we don't we don't expect just in my mind need to be able to come up with something that'll fix your situations or help you but we do expect that god could come down and change what i'm going to say and direct it directly where it needs to be and say the things that need to be said and heal the sick and and and touch the person that needs to be touched we believe in a god like that do you believe that today now brother daryl ward is going to be with us on easter and that service will be saturday night at six o'clock and then sunday morning at 10 30 on easter so you all invite your friends and your relatives and i believe god will bless us with that brother someone told me brother wayne lawson's going to be at brother matt morris's the church that brother matt morris pastors that are in blackrock tomorrow night so if you want to go fellowship with them that would be good as well let's stand together i'll probably do that i've been in church so many times i might as well go again right so we're just blessed to be in the house of the lord i watched those kids they were so excited to be in a camp after being shut up all year and just seemed like it just just kind of uh they got so enthused and maybe some people might say over enthused but you know and someone might say well maybe one just copied another and that's probably true in some cases but you know what you can also copy another person sitting like a bump on a log that's not good either so we need to always follow the lord and i believe we should worship god with all of our hearts tonight did you come expecting something from god and i believe god can give you what you have need of tonight i want to finish this this particular thought of marriage tonight on the mystery of marriage and he said brother ben why are you preaching on this well because god told me to and i can't not i have a contract with god i can't not do what he tells me to do if i if i do that then i'm a hireling and you might as well get you another pastor but i believe god knows what he's doing and even when i don't know i have to leave that up to him amen and we should trust the lord to know the right things to say and think of it in a spiritual way tonight in genesis chapter 3 and verse 12. we'll read there in just a moment let's bow our heads for a word of prayer heavenly father we've talked and and talked about these good things that you've done for us but tonight lord i pray that we could now talk to you and knowing that unless you anoint the words that are spoken there's nothing that we could do to to bring it into the hearts of the people lord if you could by your spirit as we were lord rejoicing as i was rejoicing today and your prophet speaking of the messiah anointing that would come on the word and how that the word he said it always goes with that and it can speak directly to the heart i pray god that you would do that tonight i pray you'd calm every spirit i pray that you'd work in every life and every heart and every home god you're the only one that can do that i can't do it but i know that you can and i trust lord that you are able to move lord tonight in this service i pray every every bond of the enemy would be broken lord and that you would come and that you would just move among us as only you can in jesus name amen amen genesis 3 12 and the man said the woman who now gave us to be with me she gave me of the tree and i did eat and the lord god said unto the woman what is this that thou hast done and the woman said the serpent beguiled me and i did eat everyone had someone to blame pray lord without his blessing to the word you may be seated i read a story once about a minor league baseball team that the manager was getting irate at his center fielder because he was kept making errors and finally he got so mad he ran out there and he grabbed him he said go to the dugout i'll do it myself and so he runs out in the field and and the first thing that comes up took a bad hop and hit the manager right in the mouth the next ball is a high fly ball and he loses it in the sun it lands on top his head the next ball is is a line drive and he rushes towards it to get it and it hits him right in the eye and so he gets so upset and he runs as fast as he can go to the dugout and he grabs the center fielder by the shirt and he said see what you've done you got center field so messed up not even i can make it work it's easy it's always easy to blame somebody isn't it but you know there's something about marriage that makes it hard to blame the other party and and what makes it so hard is that it's a completely unique institution it's a unique institution you find that even reflected in the laws of the nation and things like that because it's unique in the idea that it's it's no longer a a dual entity but it's a single entity and it was god's idea right so if marriage is god's idea who should set the rules for it he should right but now he it's his idea and that's what makes it unique and that's why gay marriage will never work and it's why marriages that are not joined together by god will never work because it was god's idea in the first place marriage belonged to god because in that union he would represent himself he would represent the entire mystery of redemption for the caleb in in a marriage and he wants to he wanted to manifest that in the man and his wife and and so the lord god said it is not good that the man should be alone who said that god did he said i will make a help meet for him right what's he saying it's my idea and if it's god's idea it doesn't matter whether they change the laws in washington it's still it's god that matters what he said about it and so brother branham says that this way said marriage is the oldest institution in the world marriage was performed first and instituted in the garden of eden it's that was the first wedding right there in the garden and god designed it he made it what it was it was a perfect institution and god makes the rules for how it works and how it's supposed to work then we have to come to the word on that now and even in a spiritual sense now i want us to go to matthew chapter 19 and verse 3 matthew chapter 19 and verse 3 and look at what jesus thought about marriage as far as the uniqueness of this institution like i said it's not a duality it's one it's two people actually becoming one entity and so the pharisees come to jesus tempting him and said unto him is it awful for a man to put away his wife for every cause for every cause now jesus does make the exception but watch the rule sometimes we judge by the exception well jesus said that he could put her away for committing fornication but what's the rule that's the exception to the rule the rule is he said answered and said to them have you not read he which made them at the beginning made them male and female he did it he's responsible for it and said for this cause shall a man leave father and mother and shall cleave to his wife and they twain two shall be one flesh one flesh and verse six he said wherefore there are no more twain but one flesh what therefore god has joined together let not man put asunder so he said god performed the wedding then man shouldn't split it up that makes sense or we're quiet tonight what god has joined together i'll just read what the prophet said about it what god has joined together let no man put a center asunder not what man joined together what god joined together and brother branham says when you've got a direct revelation from god that that's your wife and the same thing he said that's yours the rest of your life that's what we need is a revelation from god i want us to look at genesis chapter 12 and verse 1 as we continue to kind of lay a background this this evening for what we want to say in a spiritual sense but we look at abraham and sarah and how that god saw them and the lord had said unto abraham get thee out of thy country from thy kindred from my father's house unto a land that i will show thee notice what he says get out of your country get away from your kin get away from your father's house and what does abraham do now watch he did right there what god told him not to do isn't that what gets us in trouble so many times but he said he did what god told him not to do he took lot his nephew and abraham took his daddy but he never told him to take his daddy but he took him anyhow he said in any bible reader you read this in genesis tomorrow when you have time he said notice that it was a fly in the ointment until the old man died he was a stumbling block all the way along and so was lot god called abraham not lot he called abraham not his daddy remember god spoke only to abraham he didn't speak to anybody else including sarah do you ever think about that he didn't speak to sarah in fact he doesn't speak to sarah until she laughs right and he said why did sarah laugh in that conversation she overhears the conversation that that that abraham has with the angel but he never reveals this to her directly he reveals it to abraham so that would be the question then if he said get away from your kindred get away from all the people that are holding you back then why didn't you have to get away from sarah and brother branham answered that he said well you say what about sarah he said a man and his wife are one amen now i hope you can see this tonight in a spiritual sense that when what god has joined together let no man put asunder a man and his wife for one when god calls abraham he was implicitly calling sarah at the same time amen and so what does he say they are one flesh the bible says so and so brother branham says this and you've heard this before and i know you've quoted it he said well you say what about sarah i'm sorry the next quote he said i believe that when god calls a man to service if he's a married man and has a help mate he calls his wife with him because they too are one amen they're one flesh amen now look in 1963 and go away jesus we find we'll fast forward to that moment when sarah laughs at the promise of god she laughs and if she was expendable at that moment at that moment of doubt i hope you're hearing me tonight but at that moment of of insecurity at that moment when she said it can't be done and at that moment when she said there's no way if if she was expendable at that moment if she was because she wasn't the one that heard the voice she was not the one that heard directly from god but david but if she was expendable then she would have been killed right there notice that she said she ran out and confessed i didn't say but you did see because he knew the secret of her heart see not only did she did she laugh but she lied about it and brother brown said now god would have took her life right there but he couldn't hurt her amen first she's part of abraham amen do we believe that tonight do we really understand that that he can't hurt that which is a part of himself amen he can't hurt that which was a part of abraham he said oh we'd be gone long ago if it wasn't part of christ amen all the things that he's done and we've run around and said it's telepathy assists that or the other but he can't touch you hey man that's why you don't judge a marriage on one bad moment you don't judge a christian on one bad moment you understand because why and that ought to give us faith shouldn't it and that's not hard for us to understand we don't we don't judge people just on a bad moment if we did and every time like the pharisees would judge their wives on one bad moment they'd put her away they'd put her away for not washing the dishes right they put her away for not doing this but the bible says god hates putting away and and we know these things get mixed up sometimes and sometimes people can't help it but god intended what god joined together let no man put us under so but every time you messed up he didn't put you away you say what about israel look at israel for a moment look at his i've had a few days to ponder these things and thinking about it look at israel here she god put them away and took the gentile bride right israel was his wife he put took he put them away took a gentile bride but what does he do he does not forsake his people but he goes back amen after the gentile age is over and he goes right back to them the gospel goes right back to them right he can't do away with them completely he can't make a full end there has to be a remnant there had to be a hundred and forty four thousand don't that give you confidence in when he deals with you he dealt with them so severely that even when dan and eve from when there was a an idol in dan and ephraim's place there and he cut them out even in the millennium it didn't even show as a part of the 144 thousand but in the new heavens and the new earth they were back there again god never lost a wife i hope you hear me today oh if it was really his wife it was really his his people his elect they're part of him he can't lose them he couldn't hurt her for she was part of abraham he said oh we'd be going long ago if it wasn't part of christ all the things that he's done we've went around and said it's telepathy it's just out of the other but he can't touch you brother brown says wrath can't touch you that ought to be a reason to be excited tonight i can tell i've been in more church than you all have been in lately wrath can't touch you amen because you're part of christ when you're born again see he couldn't do it because it would hurt abraham so for him to put you away as the bride would hurt christ amen amen that's why we do everything we can to salvage a marriage everything we can to salvage a home because god he does it easily what does he do he tells even he deals with israel in such a way that he deals with her like he told the pro the prophet i believe it was jose go down and find an adulterous woman find a prostitute a heart marry her and then she commits all these things and he said go buy her back he said that's the way i dealt with israel why she it was his people he couldn't do it because it hurt abraham his promise was to abraham and sarah is the part of abraham and the church is a part of christ see the bride see he couldn't do it although her unbelief i'm glad he never judged me on my weakest moment hallelujah aren't you glad that he doesn't judge you based on your weakest moment but you're judged in christ you're judging him there on the cross amen amen listen he says a woman marry a man now now look to have this kind of a oneness there has to be agreement there has to be agreement you've got to agree with god that he'll take your sins from you you've got to agree with god you can't say now lord i'll keep them i'll just keep my own name my own identity no that's not how it works in order to be married to christ the word you've got to agree with him amen he said if if a woman marries a man and disagreeing with him it would be some kind of a fuss continually right and we laugh you know they had an old tv show called the honeymooners i think it was they're always just griping at each other and we laugh at that but that's not how marriage works because if you're constantly in disagreement eventually you're not really one you understand you've got to come together on something he said when a man and his wife his girlfriend is espoused when they are in perfect harmony so the time to get in harmony is not after you get married right and i know there's not very many of you eligible to get married tonight and but if there is maybe it's just my kids and some of these younger ones but if you're looking for a wife i'm happily married i'm not looking and i'm so glad that i'm married but you know the the time for agreement is before my wife and i came to an agreement before we got married and and one of the things we agreed on was was in ministry and i told her i said i'll always involve you in the decision but if god speaks to my heart to take to pastor a church to be somewhere to go somewhere i i i want the i have to have the liberty to do that and she's always given that to me she's never questioned me on that and and that but that's part of the agreement right and i told her i'd always involve her and i always would i wouldn't make a decision like that just out of nowhere but yet there was an agreement we we made and we decided that before we got married because being married to a preacher is hard work right and being married to anybody's hard work but it's worth it but now he says when a man and his wife his girlfriend is espoused when they're in perfect harmony like one soul and mind because they're going to be one flesh amen he said then when the church can get in such harmony with god until the manifestation listen to this the manifestation of the bridegroom is manifested in the bride hallelujah there is so much harmony because until the manifestation of the bridegroom is manifested in the bride what did the bridegroom do brother joe if you go back and look what did the bridegroom do the bridegroom had wherever he went he he healed the people that were there where the healing followed signs wonders and miracles and what did he say he said these signs shall follow them that believe right then if there's harmony that's got to be in the church if there's harmony you and i have to become the word in that sense right we we become a portion of that word for our day we become the light of our hour in that sense because why because that's what he was he was the word of his day but we become the word of our day and that's not nothing great you say well that means i have to know all the mysteries no it just means you manifest out of your life the word of what a what a husband should be what a what a what a believer should be at the end time when hard times come you don't give up why he didn't give up in gethsemane he didn't give up when the hard times come when the storms come you have the the power and the ability to speak to the waves and and they're still why you say well how do i have that yes you do if you're a part of him why because the manifestation of the bridegroom is manifested in the bride you're in agreement but the problem is and i didn't intend to dwell on this but you just hang with me for a moment the problem is so many times we get out of agreement and we get on a in a spiritual tiff with god where we're we're kind of angry and we don't realize that we're angry at god we think we're angry at the pastor we think we're angry at somebody else we think we're angry maybe he had a spouse or children but that's not who we're really mad at we're really mad at god for allowing certain things to happen in our life but listen if we could ever come back in agreement with him and say lord i know you know what's best for me i know you've got my life planned out exactly how how it should be i know all things are pre-planned by god and if that's the case i'm not going to be mad at you anymore i want to be in fellowship with you because in order to have this manifestation in the bride you've got to have agreement you've got to agree with the word you've got to say i may not be able to live it like i want to i may not be where i want to be but i'm not where i used to be and i know i'm i believe the word is true whether i can do it or not the word is true and then if i acknowledge i agree the word is true my husband will help me amen amen do you love him tonight he said the church can get in such harmony until that manifestation of the bridegroom is manifested in the brine we're going to dig deep tonight so just hang on brother brother said notice what harmony jesus never did anything until scene of the father or the father showed him first harmony between god and christ see john 5 and 19 sold the bride he shows her his word of life he shows her and she receives it she never doubts it because she knows that he knows best see we have something that even eve didn't have even adam could blame one another they blamed one another because they realized each was imperfect after the fall but we have one who's never fallen right and he shows us his word of life he shows her and she receives it she never doubts that nothing can harm her not even death but the seed be planted the water will rise and it raise it up again and this is where he wrote his word to the church with hell and he said i got a great big hallelujah brother branham was shouting on paper great big hallelujah he said here is the secret the word is in the bride and the mind of christ to know what he wants done with the word and she does it in his name she has thus saith the lord we really believe that tonight she has just said the lord she has this saith the lord then it is germatized so the holy spirit waters it until it has grown and serves its purpose now watch this this unity that comes in this peculiar relationship of marriage no other relationship shares both blame and credit like the marriage relationship there's nothing else like it now the truth is there is times there are times to use the correct english when someone is to blame especially in our natural relationships that's just the truth i've been to blame more times than i can count and a few times when i really wasn't you know that you've been wrong i've been wrong i think we need to recognize that i start to see each other as fallible human beings you know part of and maybe i over empathize in some ways but and i have to be careful with that because i don't want to hurt nobody it's not my nature it's not that's not the way i approach the gospel i don't want to hurt anybody but you do have to have empathy for people or you can't help them you have to be able to walk a little bit in their shoes so you can't help them and you realize that that you have to be able to understand that that's a human being and just because he said something maybe a preacher they even preached something that well i don't agree with that i'll tell you what that man's just a deceiver or maybe he just had a bad day you know what's in the news right now there's a young man who was a christian young man i don't know why i'm going here but just hang with me for a moment we're still early the young man was a christian young man and he he was a man a young man who struggled with lust and just i think yesterday the day before you heard in the news that all those massage parlors got shot up and the young man had went into the intro only he killed eight people in different massage parlors around atlanta he was going to kill more and they caught him but i thought it was striking because everybody is incensed all up in arms because the sheriff when they asked him about the young man they said they said what what happened what is he is he a terrorist is he is he crazy why did he do what he did and he said well he had this problem and he had a bad day and you look at that and the first thing you crossed your mind the same thing across everybody's mind a bad day i had bad days too i don't go shoot anybody up but he's human and the truth is that the potential is there in human beings there's a lot worse potential than that in human beings in flesh that's no better or worse than ours that's why paul calls it this body of this flesh he said oh wretched man that i am that potential is there but there's got to be something on the inside as the song said something keeps holding me there's got to be something there that overwhelms that in your life there's got to be something that keeps you something that i believe in a god that can keep you from every sin i believe in a god that can keep us from ever crossing the line but remember we're human he did have a bad day are you with me now you see when you're wrong you're wrong even if the other person is more wrong or wrong about something more important than you say well but but he's wrong but if you're wrong you're wrong and that's why jesus said judge not that you be not judged because you've got a moat in your own eye and you're trying to point out the speck in somebody else's eye right if you're wrong you're wrong that's hard for us as husbands and and fathers to get sometimes when we're wrong we're wrong and we could be wrong for years huh but people hold on to false ideas they hold on to false doctrine they hold on to false ways of doing things because that's the way daddy did them that's the way mama did them that's the way somebody else did them but they hold on to that but when you're wrong you're wrong regardless of who told you you're wrong or how you found out you were wrong and a little humility would tell you that even if the other person is more wrong you're still wrong you see eve was wrong the bible says adam was not deceived but the woman was in the transgression she was wrong she was wrong first she was wrong most because she did it out of deception and in some ways you could say well he's worse but he did it for a reason now brother branham says this he said we know god does not change we want to always remember this that we are finite and he's infinite infinite we should just stop there we should remember we're finite and that's why i try to tell you i i don't stand up here all the time and tell you well god did this and god did this and god spoke to me here i believe he does speak to me i wouldn't stand here unless i believe that he did i have to believe that you understand we're wasting our time but i'm finite i make mistakes but he's infinite and that's why the more i yield myself to him the better the preaching becomes the more i yield myself to him the better husband i become the more i yield myself to the word the better father i become are you with me now because i am finite he's infinite now if god ever makes a decision ever called to make a decision and god's decision being is infinite he has to continually stay with that decision unless he said see he said i can make you a promise and tomorrow i can say i was wrong why because brother branham was a man he said i can make you a promise and tomorrow i can say i was wrong and that's a different thing than to say or try to discredit the message because i know people are troubled by that today because we see so many that have tried to discredit the message no we believe the message saying brother branham is a man is just saying the message is true because that's what the message says that's what the messenger said but we believe the message come from god this the message was more than just a man we don't have anything without this message now he says he's infinite he has to continually stay with that decision he said i can make you a promise and tomorrow i can say i was wrong see i'll say i was mistaken i didn't mean to say that i see different now but god cannot because he's perfect you see sometimes we're just wrong and the more we admit i'll tell you this just in dealing with people the more you admit where you're wrong the easier it is to deal with other people who are more wrong brother branham and just to give you an example of this this this is fascinating to me and at the same time humbling because brother branham is on a hunting trip for his anniversary he does it for 20 years in a row and i i don't want any of you to get any ideas from that because the truth is sister media was built a certain way to be able to take that i've often wondered if brother branham's first wife hope had been alive if she could have taken what media took god knows what he's doing right but but you know so for 20 years every year he took her with him on a hunting trip for their honeymoon and then for 20 years he keeps going back leaves her at home every while other brother said sounds like a good time but it caused problems of course it would it caused big problems for me i mean now but she was built in such a way that could take it but he said walking up there he said i was going along now remember this is when brother branham it's amazing how god's servants can be where one moment they're speaking to the storm and another moment they're in the flesh and they're walking with god and they're thinking these thoughts that aren't right all right not sinful or lustful or anything but just thoughts that are need corrected it's true brother branham tells us that i don't listen he was walking with god remember the story how that he how the the storm the snowstorm that was coming and brother speaks to it and it stops we serve an incredible god don't we he speaks to it and it stops and then he said the angel lord told him walk with me and he's walking with god he said walking up there i was going along he said now this part he said i hope my wife don't get this tape he said but i'm going to tell you something he said i'll just tell you the truth i'm glad that he did he said that's the only way to do it he said i've often wondered why she didn't complain about me going on those trips on our anniversary now the mind is a strange thing because some of you would would die to have somebody that would not complain about your hunting trips i know none of you sisters complain about those things but i don't hunt so i can say that but there's things you know a wife would complain about that normally but brother brown begins to wonder why doesn't she complain he said you know what i had made up in my mind i said there's so many people around the house and always he said you know how i am nervous and everything he said i talk i want to talk about all i want to talk about is god the bible or something he said maybe she thinks it's a little rest for her right for him to be gone i know there's times that it is the rest for our wives when we're gone but he said maybe he's thinking this in his mind while he's walking with god he's thinking this he's being human right he's thinking that it's in his mind he says maybe he said she just thinks it's a little rest for her and he said there's so many people around the house he said and then i'm always he said you know how i am nervous and he said everything i want to talk about and he said she gave me away for a few days to go hunting he said i half thinking of that or like thinking in the back of your mind he said going along there he said then he said i'll apologize to her he said and i asked god and i'm asked god to forgive me for such thoughts they were wrong see when you're wrong you're wrong see sometimes we don't understand even the grace that god's given us in our own relationships sometimes we don't understand the grace that god's given us in our own life we second guess and we think well maybe maybe god just don't love me and that's the way he was doing with his wife maybe she maybe she really don't love me he said i was going along there i thought well my goodness she's a worker you know all the time when she's out in the kitchen or somewhere audi said any of you knows her that washing machine is going all the time and so i'd go out he said i'd pull her i said don't be washing like that talk to me see i love you i want you to tell me something tell me you do too and this is common in a relationship in a marriage one person says that more often than the other why brother because you're human right you're not going to be the same in every fleshly element but you're one flesh and you can be in agreement are you with me now praise the lord nobody is look brother branham continues he said any of you know sir that washington going all the time i already said that he she said well now what you know i do then write on washing just as hard as she ever was he'd say i don't want you to do that i want you to come in here and sit down by me oh bill i i got so much work to do and i thought well see going up here she gets time to do her work going along there thinking that he said now remember i laid this bible up here so you'd see i'm before the word as i was walking along something happened to me now look you see in his mind he's beginning to blame her and the truth is he had something that worked it worked don't take something that works for granted right just because you're not the couple that puts all the little cute pictures on facebook don't take something that works for granted right it works some of you all say man that just worked for a long time and he said first i was thinking about when i take her on the honeymoon up there and she was a pretty black headed brown eyed girl and i was looking over those logs and trying to get her up there this place where i'd killed some bear i wanted to show her one where i got this bear she had on my cowboy boots that's about 22 21 years before that he said i believe he said we were married in 1941. i was picking her up over these logs and i thought now poor little fellow putting up with me she's done turned gray yeah i thought well and i went him and i hadn't shaved for a few days and found out i was gray too i seen my beard sticking out here gray i thought oh boy you're just about finished now boy he had some thoughts didn't he while he was walking with god he said see you're going to do anything you better hurry up you're getting old too and so as i went along like that something taken place i just love the grace of god all of a sudden in every motion principle i was a boy i thought as a boy i had my head down and i looked up and just as plain as i ever saw her he said there she stood before me with her arms out that's what he was wanting he was wanting her to show and god said she loves you see you walk with god god it'll do wonders for your marriage he's just walking with god thinking these thoughts and all of a sudden he sees her with her arms out and i stopped and i rubbed my face and i looked and i said mida is that you honey i looked here and i thought now what's happened i thought yes i'm walking with him and it changed then i was back an old man and the vision was gone from the front of me but listen if you just keep walking with him god will set your thoughts right if you just keep walking with him god will get you corrected when you begin to thinking wrong what did he do he showed her him his wife with her arms out but he showed himself in a perfect body this is one of these days we're going to step into that amen amen we're going to step into that he let his prophets step into it to show us we're going to step into it one day if you walk with god see he'll correct your thinking i want you to notice this and i'm closing in just a few minutes but so if you're wrong you're wrong but you are always part of the solution even when you're wrong whatever the problem is in your marriage you are always part of the solution because you're one does that make sense she was part of the solution you can't say abraham couldn't say just throw sarah away remember what happened in hebrews 11 11 it says through faith also sarah herself received strength to conceive seed and was delivered of a child when she was past age because she judged him faithful who had promised remember we said she had a part because she was one with abraham listen you have a part today brother says this in the marriage of the lamb he said we know there's going to be a bride and there's going to be a wedding supper served in the skies that's just as sure to be as god is because it's his word and we know that those who are going to make up that bride is going to be his church and they're going to appear before him without spot or wrinkle how well you can't clean your garments you can't make them spotless but you can put them on see god didn't leave us without a part you understand we have a part a part to play listen he said they have the material he said they have the material on earth now to make themselves ready do we believe that tonight church amen he said if you notice it she has made herself ready so many says that the lord will take this evil spirit from me from drinking or from gambling or from lying or from stealing i'll serve him he said but that's up to you see you got to do something too they that overcome shall inherit all things they that overcome you have power to do it but you must be willing to lay it down you can't just say well he'll do it when he gets time he'll do it when the time is right you know that's one as we were praying with the young people it's one of the things you really have to overcome with young people is well it's not the right time when i get older then i'll serve god no you need to serve him now the bible says today is the day of salvation now is the accepted time and satan leaving you scripture against you brother timothy was outside of the tabernacle the other night where there's a prayer line going on and i'm there praying with brother joe and some of the other ministers brother timothy went took a shower he thought the service was over he comes back we're still in a prayer line and there's a young man who went outside and the young man told him he said now he said now i he said i need to be baptized i got to get baptized you want to be baptized right then he said why why do you need to be baptized he said i need i have to receive the holy ghost and he thought he had to be baptized before he could receive the holy ghost and we know that that's not true because the ones in cornelius house received the holy ghost and then got baptized right but he thought he had to be baptized he said i got to be baptized he said why don't you receive the holy ghost and then get baptized and it was just like a light bulb went off seeing the cartoons with a light bulb over a man's head light bulb went off on him and and he just fell right there and received the holy ghost what is that he just realized that god wanted to give it to him he had a part to play though he had to accept it are you with me tonight god can do those things for us he can he can change our lives he can make us where we are we're to the place where we need to be he can take an impossible situation make it something that that is a reality in our lives make the world a reality in our lives but we have to be willing to do whatever our part is we have to be willing to say god i know that you know what's best for me i'm not going to try to micromanage my situation i'm not going to try to keep myself in a in a box and make sure that i control everything i realize i can't control it lord but i know you can you say how does god want to do something for me i don't know how he wants to do it for you he may want to do it in a prayer line he may want to do it with your pastor laying on hands he may want to do it at home in your closet i don't know how what will i feel when i jump haul or scream i don't know you may just accept it and go on but he wants to do it you just got to figure out what your part is was to go up and be prayed for wait for the movie of the water whatever that is you have a part to play you see god could not push us through a little pipe pull us out on the other end he said and then say blessed is he that overcometh you had nothing to overcome he just pushed you through but you've got to make decisions for yourself i have to make decisions for myself in doing that we show our faith and respect to god now watch what happened with abraham and sarah it says sarah abraham abram's wife bury him no children and she had a handmaid an egyptian whose name was hagar and i watch she gets an idea she has the right problem identified but the wrong solution because it's somebody else right so the right problem we need something we need a child the word of god has to be fulfilled but the solution wasn't part of her she couldn't believe for herself so she said why not hagar but see she was the one married to abram bad you're the one married to christ not you can't let some other church do it some of the person do it let the pastor do it let the preacher know i'm married to christ the word this word has to be manifested in my life i have to come in agreement with the word i'm afraid to ask if you're with me but you're part of the solution very bad and you may not know what it is yet sarah didn't know you see god never told sarah he never told abraham anything about sarah until genesis 17 15 and he said unto abraham as for sarah thy wife this is after ishmael was born after he's born and she don't know what's going on she don't have a clue and sometimes god allows us to be like that we don't know but that's why we have to be willing to let him work we have to be willing to let god work god you put me in a box for a reason you put me in this situation you allow me to be here for a reason you must be going to do something supernatural in my life sarah's partner's revealed 20 and 6 reveals our part of the first resurrection he said blessed and holy is he that hath part in the first resurrection part but the brain says that this way i may not forget i'm hurting to save time he said may not forget that you're a part in that resurrection the quickening power it doesn't say we'll be in you one day we'll be in you when you have a great revival someday and maybe like the youth meetings we had this weekend but youth meetings come and go but the quickening power is now in you amen it's all settled you're god's child amen amen does god ever change his mind about his word brother brenda said but i wanted to get that message to you that you are a part of this resurrection see don't worry about it no more just rejoice over it you're part of the solution don't worry about it just rejoice over there is nothing nowhere can separate you from it nothing eternally secured in the kingdom of god when god has stamped his seal upon you you're to the end of the destination amen amen you're to the end of the destination he said but i've grieved him but he said you're still sealed until the day of redemption amen so come back in agreement with him christ is the mystery of god revealed but the brother said then the bride body must follow the head for it is a part of his resurrection brother branham identifies it it's a marvelous if you go back and listen to the table the brandon identifies as a as a body that's in the dirt a body in the grave then the head is raised but he said the body must follow the head amen it is part of his resurrection and part of the mystery it's impossible for it not to go he said oh my it's part of god's mystery how god revealed himself here and raised it up by the word so he reveals his church and raising it up by the same word it's a part of his threefold mystery what was the third fold of that to take you back to the garden of eden again oh can you see the mystery of marriage can you see it it's not just showing a man and wife it's just an example here on the earth but it's showing that he wants to take us back to him he wants us to be in agreement with him so the bride body must follow the head he said the head the body must follow him to eden do we believe that tonight hey man i'm skipping through some of this but he said in a group like this he said but in a group like this it's the closest place to heaven that there is on the earth just let that sink in for a minute in a group like this and you see satan attack that he'll attack that every which way he can try to keep you out of the group you understand and i trust those of you that are watching tonight are part of that group you're grouping with us in spirit if not but there's something about being in the house of god it's the closest place to heaven that there is on earth now you may not be able to feel that or know that but that's not because he doesn't make it home for you it's not because he don't make you feel like a part are you with me the problem when it comes to this is always us it's always us because in a group like this it's the closest place to heaven that there is on earth and we ought to want to be in heaven on earth shouldn't we he said when we are here standing together this morning we are already dead that job's done over and we are buried that's right all buried and then not only that but we are risen again i may have problems but i'm in the closest place to heaven that there is on earth it may be wednesday night but i'm in the closest place to heaven that there is on earth amen i may have worked hard all day i might be weary in my body and tired but i'm in the closest place to heaven that there is for the bill on earth your body might be hurting tonight your mind might be hurting you might be upset but you're in the closest place to heaven that there is on earth why a vindicated prophet told you that amen you're in the closest place to heaven's dress on earth where do you get it from well the bible says you're seated in heavenly places in christ jesus amen hallelujah we're not apart by our own efforts of that group but because he chose us in him therefore we make an effort amen as i said i'm so happy you made an effort tonight to sit in heavenly places with christ we're raised and in christ in his resurrection we're part of it and now we're assembling together in heavenly places in christ jesus do we realize what we're doing tonight church he said we're part of it we're in him by baptism see by one spirit we are all baptized into one body and here we are now assembled the body of the lord jesus hallelujah amen and i put this one i wrote this one down so i would remember it because it's all my notes is what you're seeing tonight but sometimes you've got to be identified with the problem so you can be a part of the solution and that's hard brother brandon says i see adam and eve the first little sweethearts they're in the garden of eden i see adam back there when he put his arms around his little sweetheart to walk out with her for god had condemned them and he started out with his arms around his darling adam was not deceived he didn't have to walk out but he walked out because he loved his wife amen he walked out with both eyes wide open no matter if she had to go to torment he'd go with her hallelujah he loved you enough he would go to hell for you hallelujah very man you know how you get in that little conversation with your wife who's gonna go to the store you both settle down you realize you don't have any milk for the cereal in the morning or whatever it is that you fix and you realize you don't have it and so you're kind of in that little bit of a maybe some of you all reach that place where you know who's going but every once in a while we still kind of you know talk about that well i've already you know i make sure to take my shoes off i've already taken my shoes off you know i'm i'm ready for bed you know it's not too late do we really need that you know and there's this back and forth but you know there's something about real love that'll make you go be it somewhere out of love for your wife or your husband even when you don't want to but jesus didn't go to walmart he didn't go down to the 7-eleven or whatever store that we have around here casey's and get a pizza because his wife wanted one he went to hell hey man hallelujah he said if she so that she won't have to but he said i'm willing to follow her there hey man oh don't you don't you love a god like they can't you love a god like that wouldn't you want to serve a god who loved you like that he walked out with both eyes wide open she had to go to torment he would go too he said when god looked down and seen that love of a human being it was so great that he couldn't stand it himself he said that's right he said i'll come and go too amen that was his son hallelujah that was his son he was displaying the fleshly fallen attributes when he was blaming eve but when he walked out with her hey man when he didn't put her away what did what was that that was his son he said that's like me that's what i want to do i'll come and go too amen amen he said for he hath made him to be sin for us he made him to be sin that's a harsh statement it's a strong word because he knew no sin sin would be so ugly to him if you can imagine if you've ever been brother brown and talked about how you can reach a place in prayer and i think we ought to reach that place church how long has it been since you prayed through since you really got free in the spirit of god that you really reached that place where sin looks so terrible to you you wouldn't do that for nothing god help us to reach that place but but see he had made him to be sin for us who knew no sin he'd never been scarred by it never been never been hardened by it and took it all took the guilt of every sin on a completely innocent being no wonder the sweat dropped like blood out of his body that we might be made the righteousness of god in him he was willing to get his hands dirty sometimes in marriage you have to be willing to get your hands dirty to make it work you have to be identified with mud daubers as moses was sometimes to make a church work you've got to be identified with the church even if you don't agree with everything that goes on sometimes you've got to get down and dirty sometimes you've got to get right down whether where it works you got to get down and do what your part even if that part is not glamorous why because it's god's elect children you're not doing it for just anybody moses moses thought the reproach of christ greater riches than all the wealth of egypt willing to get his hands dirty that's the way jesus was let's bow our heads together i preached right at an hour it's long enough god knows what he's doing you believe that tonight somehow he wanted this sermon preached and i don't know why he wanted it done then i just asked you to examine your heart and your life and we'll brother alan come in a moment and sing and worship just a moment but while it's quiet you just talk to god for a moment lord you help me today help me and this atmosphere and this presence that i feel helped me to know what you did for me lord and help me to be willing to do my part whatever that is in my marriage in my home in my church help me to be willing lord i don't understand always understand how you're working but i know you're working even when i can't see it you're still moving you're still working just talk to him like that heavenly father lord jesus we love you tonight we thank you for your presence that we feel i pray you'd reach down into every heart and every life maybe not a shouting time tonight but i believe your presence is here there will be times we can shout and i'm so grateful for that and i'm grateful for the freedom that we have in your spirit i ask you tonight to come and just search every heart everyone that's watching lord every member of this church every person lord that would hear especially those who congregate together here lord may we be willing to do what it takes to make sure that it works because sometimes you'll you'll take the dress and you'll make it for us you'll provide a message we've got to be willing to put it on we got to be willing to be identified with it though the world laughs and calls it a cult and everything else but we got to be willing we can't be embarrassed of it because it's the robes that our husband gave us i pray you grant it lord tonight we thank you for what you've done for us as a church i thank you lord i just thrilled my heart today and i i know i'm not the most excitable person in the world or the most exciting preacher but just think of what you've done for us lord it just means so much to me to be able to sit there with with a brother today and to be able to see these precious saints or that have come out it's the closest place to heaven that i can be on earth i'm so grateful for that lord help us never to take it for granted but lord may we worship you in every moment of every time not just a church lord but on the job at every moment we can have that atmosphere in our lives and our hearts i pray that you grant it lord i thank you for what you've done i thank you for what you're doing for my family i thank you for what you're doing for every one of these families lord we we just have to be patient and know be still and know that you're god it doesn't mean not to make noise but it means to wait patiently not get up and and make an ishmael
