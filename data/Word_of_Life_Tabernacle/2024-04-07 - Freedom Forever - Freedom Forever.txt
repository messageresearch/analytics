grant it now we love you we thank you in Jesus name amen thank the Lord hallelujah John chapter 8 and verse 31 I want to speak to you this morning morning a thought of freedom for forever Freedom Forever it's good to have each one with us this morning good to have my uh sister and brother-in-law back there and the and the kids always good to have them and and each one of you that are here if I'm missing any other visitors welcome this morning good to have most of the home crowd here we've got several a few missing but grateful to have each one of you and and U brother Stewart's going to be preaching for us tonight and uh we're just looking forward to that we haven't heard brother Stewart in a while and then um uh I may not be here on Wednesday but if I'm not brother Joel will will take that service but uh we're glad to have uh the the ministers that we have aren't we and the ministry that we have we believe under the messenger of the hour the bride is the final voice to the final age and so we believe we're part of that and we want to be part of that voice at our voice to that for this age amen let's turn to John 8:31 we begin to read then said Jesus to those Jews which believed on him if you continue in my word then are you my disciples indeed and you shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free they answered him we be Abraham's seed we're never in bondage to any man how sayest thou you should be made free Jesus answered them verily verily I say unto you whosoever committeth sin is the servant of sin the servant abideth not in the house forever but the son abideth forever if the son therefore shall make you free you shall be free indeed I pray the Lord would add his Blessing to the word you may be seated this morning I was in the post office the other day and and getting a postage stamp and I picked up uh these stamps as the ones that they gave me and they say freedom on them I know you can't read it from there but it's a US flag and it says freedom on it and at the bottom it says forever because it's a forever stamp and when I saw that it something pricked my heart and and spoke to my heart and and and and said that's the kind of Freedom that I want is freedom forever I don't want a temporary Victory I don't want a a slight repri from suffering I don't want you know if you've struggled with something in your life if you've struggle with sin if you struggle with heartache if you struggle with uh W with trouble in your life you don't want just a temporary thing you you want freedom you you want freedom that lasts and I don't want what Pharaoh offered the children of Israel when he come to them and he begin to offer a a reprieve from their taskmasters he said why don't you just take a three-day journey and go into the Wilderness and leave your wives and children at home and go Worship the Lord and come back that's not the kind of Freedom that they needed because were going right back to the whip of a Taskmaster they were going right back to the same old thing that they'd always been in I don't want a temporary Revival I don't want a good feeling I don't want just a a small uh momentary uh thing that makes me feel good I want something that lasts I need something in my life that that can drive me to the house of God when I feel like it when I don't feel like it that'll bring me to the my knees when I feel like it when I don't feel like it no matter what it is going on my in my life I want to freedom forever and every one of us we we've experienced bondage we know what it's like to be in the bondage of sin but we also know what it's like to be free yes and we want that freedom to last yes sir how many of you that you can say Amen to that this morning I want freedom to last I don't want it to be a temporary thing I want it to be freedom forever so we don't want just temporary Freedom not interest said although we love when the Winds of Revival roll through but I want the Revival to be in me now what is freedom freedom in the context of what Jesus was speaking of when he said I'll make you free indeed is speaking of uh someone who is delivered from slavery freeing someone a person or a thing from slavery and the Jews were actually insulted that Jesus identified them as slaves yeah or former slaves yeah because watch what they told him they answering him we be Abraham's seed and were never in bondage to any man think at that testimony we heard as children that a little old Holiness lady stood up she said well I've always been a good girl and you know some of us might be able to say that on and to some extent we needed salvation didn't we we needed freedom but the Jews were in insulted because they said we've always been free yeah we've always we were born free and so uh you know they forgot about that little time down there in Egypt you know and that little time they spent in Babylon but they said we're born free we're a free people but Jesus wasn't talking about freedom in society he was talking about freedom in their souls and the three we find there were three classes of people in that time in Roman society it was a slave Society it was Society Society built on slavery and so there were slaves there were freed slaves and there were Freeborn men and you you were fit into one of those things a Freeborn Man could become a slave but a slave could never become a Freeborn Man he might be freed but his life would always be marked by having been enslaved so if you were born a slave if you were a slave first you could never be oh my you could never be completely free but if you were free first you could be free and brother brandom takes that we're going to get into a sermon brother brandom preaches called return and Jubilee brother brandom takes that and types it to predestination and said if you ever were in God's mind you can be free you can have freedom forever you know because you're predestined by God to Freedom now uh so if a person had been a slave his life would always be marked by having been enslaved and slaves and their families were the property of their owners who could sell them or even rent them out at any time lives were harsh slaves were whipped branded or cruy mistreated their owners could kill them for any reason and would face no punishment for doing so right around the age of 30 a slave could expect to gain their freedom but if their freedom was given to them they would still have to work for their former slave owners so they would always be in a sort of bondage so the slave owner would said said you can be have your freedom but you're going to be in a in a kind of uh relationship where I'm you're always going to work for me yeah right but but but now that's a person that was a slave and their children would go into slavery right so they could be free but their children were going to slavery but if they could buy their freedom if a price was paid they were would be completely free but then their past would always be with it so again you see those classes of people there are some that could never escape the B bondage of of slavery some that could Escape through a generosity of the owners they could live pretty good but their children would be slaves there were some that could gain freedom but there were some others that were born free and remained free now Jesus told the Jews he said you're not thinking about it correctly he said actually because you won't believe the word because you won't recognize who I am as as as God in flesh he said you're actually slaves yeah you're slaves to sin right he said but I can make make you free yes free indeed free forever right oh I believe we still serve a risen savior today and I want to stand here until the day that the Lord takes me off the Earth by way of Rapture by way of the Grave I want to stand here and Proclaim there is Liberty in the house of God there's freedom in the word of God there there's strength to overcome everything the devil would throw at us we don't have to live as if we're going to get him by the skin of our teeth we can make it and we can live in Freedom all right are you with me the morning so far yes you got to be free indeed free indeed now look now joh Jesus answered them and said verily verily I say un you whosoever committeth sin is the servant or the slave of sin Paul explains this in Romans 6:16 know you not that to whom you yield yourself servants to obey his servants you are to whom you obey so you can stand and say I'm a free man but when the cigarette urge comes on right you've got to smoke it you can stand there and say I'm a free man but when the when when you're alone in the room with the computer you've got to go after it right you can stand and Proclaim I'm a Christian but when there's something about it you just can't seem to you you can't seem to be completely free but I'm here to Proclaim to you this morning there's a gospel there's a word that can free you this morning completely free compl completely and eternally free so it's not what you say about yourself it's not what the Jews said about themselves but he said you're actually in bondage to sin and don't know it you're in bondage to unbelief now sin is bondage his servants you are to whom you obey whether of sin to death or of obedience under righteousness sin is bondage Paul said in Romans 7:14 we know the law is spiritual he said but I'm carnal sold under sin sold under sin mean he was sold as a SL sold in the slave market but but listen we were not born to be slaves we were not born in a slave family you were not oh God if we just realize who we are today some people struggle with things for years and they think well it's just who I am no it's not who you are who you are was in the mind of God before the foundation of the Earth when the sons of God shouted for Joy that's where you were you were in the the back part of God's mind before the world ever began that is who you are yeah yes that's what you're being called back to that's what this message is being this message is not a history this message is not is not some kind of a dead letter but this message calls you back to what you were in his mind yes heyen now look we we weren't born originally to be slaves but we were born in this world under a bondage of sin we are Freeborn children if you if you're born again today you're made free by the son who paid the price for your freedom oh aren't you glad aren't you glad he paid the price he didn't just say okay you can go free but he actually paid the price he says you are bought with a price yeah now watch what he says be not ye the Servants of men don't go hire yourself out right to the flesh anymore don't go hire yourself out to the devil don't go hire yourself out to pornography don't go hire yourself out to uh to unbelief don't go hire yourself out to depression and anxiety he said don't be a servant of sin yeah right you were bought with a price amen walk like it act like it are you with me now oh you didn't gain freedom by the devil's Good Will on you didn't gain freedom by your own effort but you gain freedom by the price being paid by the Lamb on Calvary and because you got your freedom your freedom was bought for you sir oh that's what makes makes us worship that's what makes us cry brother B talked about Abraham Lincoln and how that he said that that black man was standing there and Abraham Lincoln's display and it showed the dress where the blood had spilled on it and it showed that was Abraham Lincoln's blood and it moved the man and brother B said why are you so moved he said I wore the chains of slavery he said and that man's blood freed Me From Slavery but I'm here to tell you this morning there's a much greater freedom in the house of God that the blood of the Son of God freed Us From Slavery freed fre us from unbelief freed us from oh that ought to make us worship it ought to bring tears to our eyes we ought to love him with all of our hearts yes we ought to love him no matter how we're feeling no matter whether we're you say well I'm having a bad day okay is he still worthy come on now oh I'm having was it as bad a day as he was having when they beat him as we said last week they beat him with all the passion they could beat him with and let me worship him with all the passion I have yeah it's good right the payment has been made I feel like the Lord's doing something this morning I know he's here do you believe he's here amen now look you're bought with a price the payments been made brother R said the in the Old Testament under the law he taught us this and it teaches us in the Bible as well every seven years there was to be a Sabbath yeah every seven sabbaths 49 years there was a jubilee year after 49 years the 50th year was a Year of Jubilee and they had to keep those sabbaths and that Jubilee that Jubilee that word Jubilee it actually means in in Leviticus 25 is where you'll find it actually means an alarm of War yeah the battlecry of a king oh my the blast for March on the day of atonment the shout of joy in public worship a musical service or shout of joy in general it's a jubilee it's a time for a trumpet to be sounded yeah and during that time of the trumpet sound then that would be the time of freedom in Leviticus 25:9 let's just go there for just a moment if you'll bear with me I know you've heard some of these things before but maybe we'll put it a little bit differently this morning and make it hopefully where we can understand it Leviticus 259 then shout that cause the trumpet of the Jubilee that's that word it it means it means a shout of Joy or or a trumpet sound of joy to sound on the 10th day of the seventh month and the day of atonement shall you make the trumpet sound throughout all your land and you shall hallow the 50th year and Proclaim Liberty throughout all the land unto all the inhabitants thereof it shall be a jubilee unto you you shall return every man unto his possession you shall return every man un his family so we find that a man who was Freeborn an Israelite under the Old Testament law could be could lose everything even his own Freedom as a result of circumstances yeah right things could happen right to an Israelite yeah the elect nation of God say why the bad things happen to me must mean I'm not elect no it don't mean that at all we live in a world that's been corrupted by sin blame it on the devil it's his fault but God allows it for our good so he said all things work together for good them that love God are the called according to his purpose so now a man who was born could lose everything as a result of circumstances but those things and his own Freedom could only remain lost Yeah by his own choice right circumstances could take it away but at the Year of Jubilee no circumstance could prevent him yeah from taking it back I just want to drive this home now sir listen his inheritance was Secure yes sir unless he deliberately chose bondage over Freedom he could have freedom forever yes now I just love this brother Brandon said now somehow or other the individual lost their inheritance that was given to them by God they're coming year called The Jubilee Year and that was every seven years they had a rest a Sabbath every seven days they had a Sabbath every seven years they had a Sabbath and seven sabbaths was 49 years and the 50th year was Jubilee and in this Jubilee every every man that had lost his inheritance by some means if he was a Freeborn and a true-blooded Israelite no matter who held the possession it had to go back to him free yeah now watch he didn't have to pay a thing come on he didn't have to do a thing but just stop what he was doing and go back to his inheritance Oh my he said he had a right to it and see the devil scare you away from that yeah but really what do you have to do to get your healing stop what you're doing and go back to it what do you have to do for your children to be saved stop what you're doing go back to the word go back to your possession go back to the promise of God start putting God first yeah you'll see your children begin to come back to God yeah oh I've seen it many times so just stop what you're doing go back to your inheritance stop the worry stop you say well I can't control that you have more control over it than you think you do yeah cuz the the Christian has the ability Paul said to to to knock down every stronghold of the enemy yeah Amen to take into captivity every thought that exalts itself against the knowledge of Christ that's where we need to be today Hallelujah that's what we need to be doing now watch now he said no matter what taken place he said he had a right to it it was a god-given right he by Grace had inherited it it would have been given to his fathers handed down year after year no matter what had taken place if he lost it it must go free it meant he said Grace is provided for each individual to return to their rightful inheritance what a picture it gives us tonight he said of the church in this last day he said you see what man can do and then you see what God does boy you could preach on that for a while couldn't you you see what man can do but you see what God does What man does is failing yeah will fail has failed and always will fail yes right amen that's why brother brandom taught the leadership of the Holy Ghost in in our churches yeah that's why he taught local church sovereignty that the leadership of the Holy Ghost is leadership of the local church why did he teach thatc listen because because we know that what God does is right yeah What man does is wrong but what God does is eternal What man does is failing but what God does is eternal must forever remain nothing can ever take it away God give it if if he saved you to today nobody can take that away from you having a bad day won't take it away from you feeling different won't take it away from you some preacher can't take it away from you a church can't take it away from you your wife or your husband can't take it oh thank God nothing can ever take it away from you you're free forever Hallelujah he said God give it it's his free gift and by his Sovereign Force I saw it and placed it and there's nothing can ever move it it's there eternally oh if we really believe that today he said in Jubilee was God's manner of expressing Grace to his people for restoring or be brought back to their rightful position now watch Leviticus 25:23 the land shall not be sold forever for the land is mine for your strangers and sojourners with me the land shall not be sold forever that's why every time Israel gives up land for peace they have a problem they always lose when they give up land for peace because the land was theirs forever the physical lamb but what is ours forever the promises of God are ours forever all the promises of God someone say all the promises all the promise every promise in the book is mine everything that's written there belongs to me all the promises of God are mine now watch he said and in all the land of your possession you shall Grant a Redemption for the land yes now I want to point out something that brother brandom actually points out in that sermon that land in a walled city was not subject to the laws of redemption now I want us to really think about this I want us to apply this to our own lives not just to other people but but ourselves and even our own church and we need to make sure we don't create a walled City and become set in our ways and take somebody else's thought over the word because if we do we're no longer subject to the laws of redemption we got to come out of that City that walled City cuz our land oh God is not behind those walls now watch Leviticus 2530 he said if it be not redeemed within the space of a full year then the house that is in the wall City shall be established forever him that bought it throughout his Generations it shall not go out in the Jubilee but the houses of The Villages which have no wall round about them shall be counted as the fields of the country they may be redeemed they shall go out in the Jubilee brother BR said Remember the ones that was walled in never got to go free they were bondslaves the rest of their time you think about how serious this is and you begin to think we don't want we want complete and total freedom we want freedom forever we don't want to trade the walls of an old city for the walls of a new city we're not going to trade the walls of a of one church for another we're not going to trade the walls of one Doctrine for another of one Dogma for another we want to be free right we want to be free we don't want to reject denominational walls and then build denominations ourselves right that's we don't want to do that what is it there's got to be a freedom from those walls now brother B said they never got to go free they were blond sides the rest of their time the owner owned them if they put their inheritance in a city that was walled in yes oh God but if it was outside little bitty cities that wasn't walled in then it oh church that's what we want to be as a church we don't want to be walled in we don't want to say we're the only ones that can make it we don't want to say if anybody else does it differently they're not right no we don't want to be walled in we don't want to add our Creeds and dogmas to the message we want a city that's open yes sir a city that's free yeah let the world know what we're doing it's all right because what we preach is the Gospel of Jesus Christ not some cult somewhere denomination somewhere in a wall City what we believe is the gospel but B how do you join by one Spirit we're baptized into one body amen right you know walls around this city are you with me now and and so we don't want to wall the city now he said but if it was outside and was considered like the plains they could go free in the Jubilee Pentecost brother R talked about they walled themselves in yeah they saw what God was doing they said let's protect this revival and they made Creeds around it and walled themselves in now and what those what are those walls well Pentecost made those walls like they said well speaking tongues is the only evidence of the Holy Ghost that's the only thing it is an Evidence but it's not the evidence right because you can receive Paul said do all speak with tongues you can receive the Holy Ghost without speaking in tongues right but but there's they made a Doctrine out of something that was not biblical right right and it becomes a wall that separated them from their Brethren now here brother BR said on these walls inside he said where if we ever get walled into a place listen I want us to take it seriously T today take it seriously each one of us I I don't want to make you uncomfortable but every one of us ought to take this personally and examine our own Hearts he said if we ever get to a place where we can't accept the word and the Holy Spirit and have to take the Creeds and so forth of a church instead of the power of the Holy Spirit the Jubilee will never mean nothing to that person right no matter how much you can say mother left your inheritance daddy did that but you sold out and walled up and come into a Creed and accepted this Dogma that was injected into your fellowship instead of being free in Christ and letting the Holy Spirit lead us yeah oh my it's serious church and you say well I don't have a Dogma I'm you know I I don't even have a church I don't even go to church well that's a Dogman in itself right that's not what the Bible says the Bible says assemble yourself together much more as you see the day approaching so anything that wouldn't assemble itself together would be a Dogma that's right it's walls you build walls around your own house yeah build them up so high nobody can come in yeah right you build walls around yourself as an individual walls of complexes walls of anxiety walls of of struggles in your own life and you build those walls and build those walls but Paul said tear down those walls yeah that's right he let them come down anything listen to anything that prevents you from hearing the word of God in Freedom tear it down yes anything that keeps you from from loving God with all of your heart anything that keeps you let it go tear it down it's not worth not being able to fill his presence it's not worth the dove of the Holy Spirit flying to the Gable end as brother put it of your soul it's not worth not feeling the influence of the holy spirit because of some Grudge you hold yeah come on it's not worth it it's not worth it to me it's not worth it to you what is is it we don't want no walls we want the Holy Spirit to move freely among us see because what the devil will do I'm just preaching it's not my notes but you just hang with me for a minute listen if you what the devil will do is he'll cause something to come against a preacher and and what he'll do is he'll he'll he'll let you build up a wall you start building up a wall of protection I don't want that preacher to do that to me I don't want that I don't want that preacher that preacher doesn't like me that preacher and you build that up pretty soon you can't benefit from nothing right but that preacher says you might not might as well not even be there because you're not benefiting because you think the person doesn't like you and the truth is it's probably not the case I've never seen a preacher didn't like people like to have people around I mean I guess there's some out there but I don't know who they are I've always thought more people was better than less people to preach to just in general it's all right but if you're not careful you build up a wall that person doesn't like me and then everything I say would become an offense right right and we got to be careful with that church because what we're doing is we get to where we can't accept the Liberty you it may not be me it may be some other preacher it may be it may be uh maybe a certain church or a certain type of Fellowship it may be just just something that's going on in your life and you let that build up walls around you pretty soon the Holy Spirit can't flow anymore you don't have any access that you don't worship like you used to you can't you're afraid to raise your hand cuz well this church doesn't believe exactly like mine does so I'm afraid to raise my hand I'm afraid to worship oh come on church we that's not what we believe we believe that every one of us are subject to failure and mistake and we're all we we may not have everything perfectly right but we love God with all of our hearts and we want to serve him with all of our heart break down those walls and let the Holy Spirit move again in the house of God let him move again in in the Hardy Arkansas we don't want no walls we want True Fellowship yeah right that's that's good but the walls if you're not careful it prevent you from hearing you know OB a wall sound won't just go through a wall it bounces off now you may hear it it may come over the top or whatever if you got a high enough wall you won't hear no sound and what they actual God they box themselves in in denominationalism so much that when the message of this hour sounds they're unable to hear it because of the wall yeah the wall prevents him from hearing the trumpet call I say oh Church let's hear Let let's go back to the message let's let's find out what a prophet said let's find out what the Jubilee was in our hour let's hear the trumpet call now brother BR said a man and his family could go back to their original inheritance if they could hear the Jubilee and a trumpet sound and know what it meant to them yeah listen if they can hear it and know what it meant to them yeah now brother BR said if they heard the priest sound the trumpet the minister he said the trumpet is the gospel and when they hear it and they know what it means and they know that that's their inheritance oh oh Church see you'll never respond to it unless you know what it means yeah and you also have to hear it so you have to be in a place where there's freedom you have to be outside of those walls and what I mean by that is not a physical place but a spiritual place in your life where there's Freedom cuz you can sit in a free church and be bound yeah right but but you need a spiritual freedom in your life that you can hear the gospel trumpet he said no matter where where they lost how far they went back whatever they had to do they had the privilege to come oh I believe it's a privilege to come and receive again their inheritance he said now watch the whole family yeah oh church I'm believing for all of my family how about you I'm believing for all of our families the whole family could come and receive their inheritance yes now brother Brandon was preaching to Pentecostals on the 50th anniversary of the Pentecostal Revival in Louisiana he said so it is tonight that men and women here of Louisiana knows the things that we do know and have heard from our brother and different ons of our Pentecostal experience of years ago and we finally have walled her he said if we haven't walled oursel away from it so far we got to hear what somebody says instead of what thus sayith the Lord is yeah we got to hear what somebody says instead of what thus sayith the Lord is you said what does thus say the Lord come through a prophet yeah don't listen to what somebody says about you right don't you don't even listen to what you say about you right CU we can be our own worst critics listen to what the word had to say about you in our hour we got to hear what somebody says instead of what thus sayith the Lord is yeah and hear what the word of God has got to say about it now is the hour of Jubilee come back to your original inheritance he said to a real Holy Ghost again he said remember he could go free didn't have to pay nothing didn't have to do nothing just get up and go oh church we just realized this morning and I I I'm I'm stirred up a little bit but it's because I realized in my own life many times what we need is not to think about it not to talk about it but just get up and go yeah just get up from where you are and go forward walk on go forward be a real Christian be a real believer get up and go on right oh I know it's hard sometimes I know it's struggle we struggle many times and I and I feel that struggle I care about that I really do care about that but we've got to get up and go on they said why s we here till we die it's what the leopard said why s we here till we die let's go in let's go down to the enemy's Camp take back what they stole from us let's let's go in hey man see our trumpet said he said they had all he had to do didn't have to do nothing just get up and go it's all he had to do go back oh if he knew the sound of the trumpet we had to know the sound of the trumpet they were sons of God for if the trumpet give an uncertain sound who shall prepare himself to battle the Bible says but we don't have an uncertain sound we have a certain sound Freeborn Israelites real Christians we would say now watch but they were living in bondage unable to reach their full potential in Christ because of Walled cities Creeds which are man-made doctrines instead of word yeah Jericho was a walled city right that's kind of an understatement Jericho had the biggest baddest walls on the place on the planet at that time right and and and what that meant was they had the the utmost in military technology in their day right it'd be like it'd be like one of these countries I've been to West Africa or or China or or the UK or something like that well they just have no no match in military technology yeah and there was no match between a bunch of people armed with pitchforks and farming implements right and here is a city that's the greatest walled City in the country yes sir but God you know we know the story how that the angel of the Covenant met Joshua there on the side of the on the side outside the walls and he told him what to do and so they marched around the city seven times but the seventh time they marched around and but they didn't just March but they oh my they blew with trumpets and they shouted yeah and the Bible said so the people shouted when the priest blew with the trumpet right you tell me it's wrong to respond loudly to the word of God in church what do you do with that scripture what's the trumpet today brother brand told us the gospel minister with the trumpet the people shouted when the priests blew with the trumpets and it came to pass when the people heard the sound of the trumpet and the people shouted with a great shout now that word shout in in the original in Hebrew is the same word it's in icus 25 it's Jubilee amen right the people when they heard the trumpet they became the Jubilee they began to shout they began to make a jubile a jubilant noise if we can say it that way that shout is the same word it's Jubilee the people shouted with a great shout the wall fell down flat so that the people went up into the city every man straight before him and they took the city so so the walls had to fall down now what were the walls doing the walls all over the city had to fall down but not one could touch rahab's house now listen rahab's house was up against the wall so the wall fell but it didn't damage her house it released her house come on come on Church it released her house where it was under the bondage behind the wall now there was no wall in front of rahab's house and it was the oh God it was the only one left standing there was no accuser left standing there was no one none of the men that had ever accuse could ever accuse her would ever be left standing but it was free right she was free I'm sure there was a jubilee going on in that house when that wall fell down right in front of the house yeah good the house literally built on the wall and people walk around what in the world everything else fell down flat but this house amen hallelujah so she could go from bondage to Freedom when she heard the Jubilee amen hallelujah you know people say well I don't I don't have any part in the church service oh yes you do yeah cu the trumpeters could trumpet all that they wanted to but the people had to shout yeah come on now preach are you with me now that's what the Bible says they had to shout yeah he said don't it wasn't enough just for the trumpeters to trumpet but the people had to shout that's good good heyen I don't mean we have to be running around all over the place I know some people have different personalities say you worship God how you feel to worship God but but don't don't be critical of me if I get a little bit overwhelmed by the presence of God don't be critical of somebody else if they get overwhelmed and they begin to shout and they begin to praise God why they heard a gospel trumpet all right and when the gospel trumpet sounds there's something about it it means freedom to me when I hear this message preach that's why I get excited when we have meetings and these brothers come in and I hear the message of the hour being preached it just does something to my heart brother the bill I can't stand still why because I know that the message of the hour is freedom it's not bondage it's not a book of rules it's freedom to me yes it's what brought freedom to my family it's what brought freedom to to us as a church it's the message of the hour hallelujah hallelujah oh I believe there's coming a great Jubilee time in fact I believe we're living in a jubilee time right why because the first Thessalonians 4:16 for the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with what Hallelujah with a shout with the voice of the Archangel with the Trump of God and the dead in Christ shall rise first and we which are alive and remain should be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air so shall we ever be with the Lord Brother said a shout what is the shout it's the message going forth first the living bread of life bringing forth the bride if we've heard the shout there's freedom for you today there's freedom for you today right I don't care what it is that's bound you I don't care I know it's a little Evangelistic this morning I don't usually do this on a Sunday morning but I'll say this it doesn't matter what's bound you you can have freedom in the house of God you can have freedom for your family you can have freedom right now in your own soul yes this Jubilee is for you yeah why because you're the elect of God predestined before the foundation of the world brother brand said it was only for the elected God's chosen that's the way it is today not that runneth or him that willth it's God that has Mercy it's God that does it God by his grace Jesus said no man can come to me except my father draws him all the father has given me will come to me it's God's grace that he chose the church before the foundation of the world he said that church will hear the word of God they'll turn every Creed down they'll turn every organization every denomination that's contrary down and they'll serve God by the power of the Holy Ghost they certainly know the trumpet sound oh do you know the sound of the message this morning said my you hear my voice what are you talking about the word the word you say that's god's voice in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God yeah it's the word that we heard oh that's what I hear when I turn on the tapes it's not a man's voice it's the word yeah but that's what I hear when a preacher preaches the same message it's the word that's right it's the word amen oh you say that's god's voice in the beginning was the word the word was with God the Word was God word was made flesh and one Among Us my sheep hear that they know it a stranger they will not follow they don't hear these Creeds they don't hear these dogmas and these things that's been injected to make an organization instead of a body all right and that's why every time it organizes it dies right right because you're not an organization you're a body right and if you treat your body like an organization you'll die because you'll inject stuff into it that doesn't belong right right just think about it for a minute you inject Creeds it's like injecting drugs in your system don't belong there yeah right stuff that not not helpful and it may seem well it'll be helpful but it'll break you down some other way and I'm not against medicine I'm not saying that but it's all has side effects don't it but this message has no side effects right only those that are pleasing to God right why it it what is it it's the same gospel that Paul preached it's the one that to preach on the day of Pentecost it's it's the the serum brother Bram calls it it's the antidote right to the poison of sin look he he said he said they don't hear these Creeds they don't hear these dogmas he said a sacrifice and offerings I would it's not but a body has to prepared me a body of Believers a body that's been born before it can be a body of human beings watch he said before I can act as a human before I can walk like a human before I could talk like a human I had to be born a human I want to tell you something I want to say this sincerely would Paul recognize the church that we have today I believe he would right even those that fall asleep there was one fell asleep and he raised him from the dead so we have a challenge but Paul recognized that he would recognize I believe the church that we have and the reason why he would recognize is because we do what Paul did right it walks like Paul looks like Paul talks like Paul right that's why brother BR said I preach what Paul preached before it can be a body of human beings before I can act as a human before I can walk like a human before I can talk like a human I have to be born a human yeah that's right he said how would a knot on a tree know how I acted well you wonder sometimes all right how can how can some of these Nots trees know how we act right oh church I feel free this morning you just bear with me how would a knot on the tree know how I acted how could he ever say I don't act like that he said of course he doesn't he said the only way he could be that would be born like me right Hallelujah that's the way organization is he said they've drawn people away it went after a Creed it's not like a non on log looking at the true church saying well y'all are too emotional y'all too this sad or the other y' follow a man y'all are called whatever whatever they want to say about it but what are we doing we're just doing what humans do we've been born by the spirit of God we're just doing what the body of Christ does are you with me now he said but in order to be a Son of God you got to be born of the spirit of God you become Christlike and do the works of Christ he said and you're not funny then you're not funny to them people yeah right to them people Holy Ghost filled people how are you with me so far yeah a human acting like a human he said it's not funny and a Christian acting like a Christian born of The Same Spirit he said you see the Pentecostal group at the beginning he's not talking about isusa Street he said that same Pentecostal group acts the same way if it's born of The Same Spirit right because it's born that's right he said that's why today people doesn't understand the church yes he said and the church has begin to grow cold and formal getting after Creeds and things and leaving off the following of the Holy Spirit the Bible tells us as many as are led by the spirit of God they are the sons of God and it says we have not receiv received the spirit of bondage we have not received the spirit of slavery we've not received a spirit of bondage to fear but you've received a spirit of adoption whereby we cry ABA father we're part of a family that's been born again we're part of a family that does not fear because we've been adopted into the family of God sir there come a time that listen brother brand talked about how they they come out under a mighty hand in the Old Testament and in Moses time but come a time when God said you've can pass this mountain long enough he said the old Fighters died off he tyed that to the Pentecostal age the old Fighters had to die off and a new generation was born and he says this he said it's time to rise I can say Amen to that this morning as we're hurrying to a close here it's time to rise be sons of God in the name of Jesus Christ and rise to a place so you can return in this Jubilee and here the sound of the trumpet of the Gospel of the word of God don't take what somebody says over the word let it be the word let it be the word not because something somebody said or you were influenced by some bitterness or something in your life let it go and take the word the word is the only thing make you free he said he said you're Brethren you're not denominated you're Brethren cuz you can't be denominated you are born sons of God if the slaves want to stay in the wall City let them stay but you're free oh can you can we hear the gospel trumpet this morning you're free let's go back he said if they want to stay there let them stay there if you proide them they'll become to full more a child of Hell than what they were right listen you're free let's go back let's go back to our inheritance let's go back to the beginning back to they led by the inspiration of the Holy Spirit we don't want a bunch of we don't want a bunch of denominational chickens running around yeah want freedom yes hallah huah yes Liberty brother Bram taught us it had to be proclaimed listen that's what Jesus said when he walked up there and said the spirit of the Lord is upon me to Proclaim Liberty throughout the land right Freedom Forever yes the kind of Freedom you couldn't get from BS and goats yeah the kind of Freedom you couldn't get from from 12-step programs yeah the kind of Freedom you couldn't get from just making yourself better and self-help with the kind of Freedom that only Jesus gives you Romans 10:14 how then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard how should they hear without a preacher and how shall they preach except they be sent right as it is written how beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace bring Glad Tidings of good things brother BR said today we have preachers ethical educated fine Scholars turned out can stand up and never move never mus up a hair never sweat a drop and just stand there and speak and all give the articles of the church and everything just so pretty for 15 minutes while you're sleeping all right hey going to sleep anyway might as well preach yeah right 15 I'm not getting on to you I love it I love it when people come to the house of God so tired they have to sleep through church but they still [Applause] came right you're still here why to show the devil whose side you're on amen he amen he said everything's so pretty for 15 minutes while you're sleeping going back home and you call yourself Pentecostals he said brother we need an old rugged Backwoods preacher we'll come out with a pair of overalls on I don't know about that hey I do it if it helps I'll tell you that right now he said hit the pulpit Hallelujah Anointed with the power of God he said he won't preach five minutes till the spirit will take the church and it's gone the rest of the night up into the heavenlies it's Eagles he said they won't Peck around on Barnyard stuff they go on up into the heavenlies for their food yeah but if you sold your inheritance if you sold out and done those things he said what am I saying return back yeah if if you joined up with some cult that tries to keep you away from fellowship with other Brethren he said leave the thing I'm not saying that's a prophet of God saying that he said this is Jubilee yeah he said man I feel religious return return this is jubilee don't let it pass by remember don't let it pass by if you sold out if you went out in the world if you sin you knew what you once had the experience you went and joined up where you can't fellowship with the rest of them he said you all these things I don't care what you've done if you're a son you have a right to return now because it's Jubilee it's Jubilee time that's what the message of the hour is it's Jubilee time you're free there's therefore now no condemnation to them which you're in Christ Jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit for the law of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death I'm not wearing those Chains No More I belong to him free yes oh Hallelujah I may still have the scars from where the chains were on my hands I may still have the scars around my feet from where I wor wore the shackles but the shackles are not on my feet anymore the shackles are not on my hands anymore I can worship with all of my heart I can love him with all of my heart I'm free I'm not in a wall City I belong to him yes sir my inheritance is secure yes made me free from the law of sin and death I believe every one of us can say that this morning if you can't say that now it's the time to hear the gospel trumpet and be free yes yes Hallelujah and when that trumpet sounded can I have just a few more minutes and the trumpet sounded a man who heard it had to respond one way or another and your response tells you what you are see it's not what you go through in life it's your response how you respond to it many times we go through Terrible Things Christians go through things that are just you don't even like to think about yeah because it's hard I know some of you have been through those kind of things we weep with those who weep yeah mourn with those who mourn and I always think in my heart brother West what if my wife was struggling with that what if that was my child brother BR said you can't enter in for somebody in prayer until you till you can have compassion on that person empathy for that person brother brand looked at that one that man that come up there with with no shoes on he's looking at his own shoes see if his shoes would fit his feet and you just it just hurt you and and ought to be that way when a member of the body of Christ hurts we all hurt yeah if we ever get to a place where that doesn't happen we need to check up as a church right yeah you're going to go through you're going to go through great difficulty but what I'm saying is is that you're able to overcome that yeah the law of the spirit of life has made you free from the law of sin and death that does not define who you are right you don't have to be bound in your spirit you you might be hurting this morning you might be sick you might be just elderly and hurting in your body you might be you might be a young person that has been struggling this week but you can be free this morning because you the reason you were struggling is because you're one of gods the reason the devil was after you is because you belong to God the reason he's given you such a hard time but you couldn't quit I think we ought to we ought to stand up sometime say I know that I I'm not what I'm what I need to be I know I'm not what I'm going to be but I know I'm not what I used to be and I know I stood somehow I made it some somehow I've been brought from my place where I was into the house of Freedom somehow I've been brought into a place where I can have freedom again I say we ought to just shake off every bond that holds us what good is it it does it doesn't do us any good to hold on to it Shake It Off let it go and let God move in your life again hear the voice of the spirit of God preaching to you there's freedom in this message Hallelujah right Hallelujah oh I believe he's here this morning Hallelujah but you got to make a choice one way or another you're going to make a choice when you walk out of here this morning you go out better or worse and exodus 21:5 tells us that if the servant the slave was called on the year Jubilee shall plainly say I love my master my wife my children I will not go out free then his master shall bring him unto the judges he shall also bring him to the door onto the doorpost his master shall bore his ear through with an a He Shall Serve him forever my heart breaks for that person yeah because maybe he was afraid to come away from that system because he thought well if I break away what do I have I don't know what's true but you got to get into Freedom before you can hear the gospel trumpet right but the thing is if he refuses to hear it if he refuses and he says I love my master I love my denomination I love the way things are going in my life I love my cigarettes I love my alcohol Watch What Happens his master comes and pours him through with an a in his ear why his ear brother BR say he made it where he wouldn't hear it no more let me tell you how you're blessed this morning if you still hear if you can hear the gospel trumpet it means you haven't you haven't been taken to the door you haven't heard I'm not talking about just hearing with these ears everybody hears with these ears but if you can hear if there's a prick in your heart if your conscience is is pricked this morning if you can feel the presence of God get up and go to it Hallelujah don't serve that Master forever you see this man could never hear again he' never hear the Jubilee He had to be willing to give up everything for Freedom yeah see Jesus said If any man come to me and hate not his father and mother and wife that doesn't mean hate in the sense of of anger and temper it means love less hate not his father and mother and wife and children brother and sisters yeah in his own life also he cannot be my disciple right other words you put everything below Christ he's first and whosoever does not bear his cross and come after me cannot be my disciple they knew what that was they they knew what it was they've seen men bear their own cross right to be crucified they knew what that meant yeah see you've got to be willing to lose it all to gain everything I think about the foundation of this country and how it was made and men that were willing to risk it all like Patrick Henry who stood up one day he said they were having a debate over whether or not we should be a free country and he said Give me liberty or give me death right I can't live like I'm living anymore I want freedom or nothing I can't have this bondage over for me I don't want to have to listen to a King in a far away land control my life I want freedom in my house oh God Give me liberty or give me death Matthew 19:29 and but there there's a reward for that everyone that have forsaken houses or Brethren or sisters or father mother or wife or children or lands for my name's sake shall receive a h hundredfold and shall inherit ever everlasting life look you receive a h hundredfold in this life yeah why because you're blessed because you made that sacrifice for God and then you inherit Everlasting yes life brandom talks about a man named Arnold Von winkl he's actually a a figure of History it's a painting there that was painted about what happened Arnold Von winkl red was a man who just an ordinary man but the Swiss were being defeated by I believe it was the austrians or coming against the Swiss they were marching over there warlike people were marching over their country and and trying to destroy their take their children into bondage and their wives and things and and Arnold Von Wier just had enough you got to have enough sometimes got just got to be fed up with being miserable before you can ever be free you got to be fed up with being miserable right and he would just fed up with being miserable and so he's he's standing there he he told the people around him he said I'm going to do something today he said I'm going to I'm going to give my life because what was happening is the Army back in that day they had Pike men and they'd stand in the front and every time the Swiss Army would come against those great big Pikes they didn't have any kind of armor like that had pitchforks and things and they'd come up against those great big Pikes that you see in the picture and they'd come up against them and they just slaughter them they couldn't break through and the only way to break through was to not care about your own life yeah to actually put the nation above his own life was the only way and he knew that and so he said today I'm dying for Switzerland and so he runs up and you see him there he grabs a hold he runs to the thickest part of the Spears and he grabs a hold of those Spears and Pikes and thr and like this and thrust in his own bosom because when he did that those behind him and around him could go through and he says he screamed out Make Way for Liberty Make Way for Liberty and brother brand said when he went to Switzerland I believe in the 40s and again in the 50s he went to Switzerland and he went over there and and when he went he said every time you mention his name Arnold Von winkin he said you mention that name tears come in her eyes because it'd be like George Washington to us or something like that but it was a great hero there but brother brand says but oh he said it was a little thing to what happened one day when Adam's race stood demons Marching In from every side prophets had failed law had failed sacrifice of bows and Lambs had failed man's nature had failed faed everything and Adam's little race stood defeated outnumbered by Devils Superstition sickness diseases there was one who stepped out in heaven and said this day I'll die for Adam's race he come to the Earth and was made flesh he looked right down where the midst of the spears was the darkest he said the very darkest of all men's dreads was death and he took death into his bosom and on Calvary he paid the sacrifice and screamed Make Way for Liberty he said and he screams to his church take this which I have left you my blood in my spirit and fight with whatever you've got he said you can we can conquer tonight through that friend you can drive the devil from you every old enemy that's in your life it can be drove out by the blood and the spirit of Christ and you can stand perfect in his presence Christ made the way from that day to this Swiss never had another War why because one man took the initiative and said Make Way for Liberty and I believe we've had a man that said Make Way for Liberty it was the man Christ Jesus because he's done that you can follow him today he tells this church take what I gave you take the Holy Ghost and follow me hallelujah oh can we do it this morning I don't know about you but I want freedom forever I want an end to the war on I want an end to those
