[30:55] as the ushers would come this morning
[30:58] we have

[31:07] mary white sister millennia uh not covet
[31:10] but they are very sick this morning
[31:13] brother paul seymour he's doing better

[50:51] about this morning
[50:53] the worlds were framed he didn't just
[50:55] say the earth but the worlds
[50:57] were framed by the word of god
[51:00] so that things which are seen
[51:02] were not made of things
[51:04] which do appear i pray the lord would
[51:07] add his blessing to the word you may be
[51:09] seated
[51:10] this morning
[51:12] i heard a story
[51:14] of a man who was visiting america he's
[51:17] visiting all the churches and he goes to
[51:19] a great cathedral in new york city and
[51:22] he finds
[51:23] in that cathedral that they had a golden
[51:25] telephone and
[51:26] it said
[51:27] a call to heaven ten thousand dollars
[51:31] and he said my goodness they said well
[51:33] it's long distance you know so it
[51:35] costs a little bit of money and so he
[51:37] goes to state by state and goes to
[51:40] america and he finds in each state they
[51:41] have churches that have phones in them
[51:44] and finally makes his way to arkansas
[51:46] and he gets to arkansas and he gets down
[51:49] a little church here in the hills
[51:50] somewhere he says he saw a golden
[51:52] telephone there but
[51:54] when he looked at that telephone he
[51:56] noticed it said call to heaven 45 cents
[52:00] and he said why is it called to heaven
[52:02] 45 cents from here can you really reach
[52:05] heaven from arkansas he said oh yes he
[52:08] said but it's a local call
[52:12] all right
[52:16] now but you know if we could have a
[52:18] telephone to heaven
[52:21] wouldn't that be wonderful
[52:22] just pick up the phone call
[52:26] and and we have prayer and we thank god
[52:27] for that but i want to uh go a little
[52:30] bit deeper this morning and realizing
[52:32] that prayer alone does not contact god
[52:35] that's right
[52:36] it's just words unless there's faith
[52:39] behind the prayer
[52:41] there's got to be something deeper
[52:42] there's got to be faith and so
[52:44] paul tells us that faith is the
[52:46] substance of things hoped for the
[52:48] evidence of things not seen and brother
[52:50] branham whenever he would quote that he
[52:52] would say not seen not heard not felt
[52:54] not touched
[52:56] right he'd go through the five senses
[52:58] and say
[52:58] that faith is not contacted or it's the
[53:01] evidence of things that we can't contact
[53:04] with our five senses now when we look at
[53:06] the five senses the five senses are are
[53:09] sight or seeing taste
[53:11] feeling touch smell
[53:13] and hearing now
[53:15] those are senses by which we contact our
[53:17] earthly home without those senses
[53:21] our contact would be dulled if you
[53:22] couldn't see
[53:23] you couldn't contact your the earth in
[53:25] that way if you couldn't feel then you
[53:28] would lose a contact that you have with
[53:29] the earth each one of those causes you
[53:31] to contact the earth in a certain way
[53:34] and
[53:35] brother branham taught us that there's
[53:36] also five senses of the spirit realm
[53:39] so now and i'm just going to do a little
[53:41] teaching this morning and kind of just
[53:43] lay this in here and if you're watching
[53:45] stir your conscience this morning and
[53:48] and then poke your husband or your wife
[53:50] and tell them watch the service this
[53:52] morning because i believe this is
[53:54] important especially being through what
[53:56] we've been through because we've just
[53:58] come through a great spiritual time
[54:00] and it's spiritual in two ways we come
[54:02] through a mighty meeting a revival a
[54:05] word of god was preached and and the
[54:07] presence of god was here but then satan
[54:10] attacks
[54:12] right that's also in the spiritual realm
[54:15] and so satan and god both have access
[54:18] to these ten senses the five of the
[54:21] flesh and the five of the spirit which
[54:23] are imagination
[54:24] conscience memory
[54:26] reason and affections
[54:29] so brother branham taught us he said
[54:31] there's three people of you
[54:33] the outside is the body you've got five
[54:36] senses that you contact your earthly
[54:38] home with that the inside is the spirit
[54:42] there's five senses there love and
[54:44] conscience and so forth you contact but
[54:46] the inside of that is
[54:48] the soul
[54:49] so now you find him teaching that now
[54:52] he said now i believe then that a man is
[54:55] saved
[54:56] when he believes on the lord jesus
[54:58] christ now listen he's saved when he
[55:01] believes in the lord jesus christ with
[55:03] all of his heart
[55:05] and from his heart
[55:07] not from his outside conscience now he
[55:10] said see you're a dual person three
[55:12] people in one soul body and spirit he
[55:15] said when you're awake in other words
[55:16] you're operated by five senses see
[55:19] taste feel smell and hear he said them
[55:22] were only given to you to contact your
[55:24] earthly home
[55:25] and they were not given to you to
[55:27] contact your heavenly home
[55:29] oh my he said there's actually six
[55:32] senses in a human body yeah oh my
[55:36] because he is number six in the bible
[55:37] the man is he said he was created on the
[55:39] sixth day he is number six a man is he's
[55:42] got seed taste filled smell here in
[55:44] faith his faith sets his
[55:46] destination he said brother ben where am
[55:49] i going what is your faith yes sir that
[55:51] sets your destination what's my life
[55:53] going to be like tomorrow what am i
[55:55] going to have to deal with in the weeks
[55:56] ahead what am i going to have
[55:58] am i going to be a real christian or am
[56:00] i going to be a halfway backslid
[56:03] huh come on church what am i going to be
[56:06] what's your faith
[56:08] that sets your destination am i going to
[56:11] heaven what's your faith this morning do
[56:13] you believe that you're going to heaven
[56:15] do you believe you're a child of god do
[56:17] you believe you're a son or daughter of
[56:19] of the king
[56:20] what's your expectation what's your
[56:22] faith
[56:23] and then that will your faith then we'll
[56:26] call what the window was talking about
[56:27] sunday morning how we welcome him in we
[56:30] invite him in
[56:31] we welcome him into our presence we
[56:34] entertain him when he comes
[56:36] your faith will cause you to do that
[56:38] the woman that touched the hem of his
[56:40] garment she had the faith to believe and
[56:42] to reach out and touch him of his karma
[56:44] what'd she touch him by by the sixth
[56:46] sense
[56:48] she didn't she didn't touch him by
[56:49] physical touch she touched him by the
[56:52] sixth sense by faith
[56:55] so now
[56:56] he said faith is the substance of things
[56:59] hoped for the evidence of things you do
[57:01] not see tastes feel smell or hear
[57:03] but by faith when he catches the word
[57:06] oh my he's talking about a man now human
[57:08] being
[57:10] by faith when he catches the word
[57:12] it sends him into a dimension
[57:15] oh my that makes it so real to him
[57:18] see unless you believe it it don't do
[57:20] you any good all the words you could
[57:22] listen to all the tapes you could listen
[57:23] to you can listen to all the preachers
[57:25] you could come and listen you could hear
[57:27] about healing over and over again you
[57:28] could heal about hear about salvation
[57:30] over and over and over again but unless
[57:32] you believe it it's never going to do
[57:34] you any good but if you ever believe it
[57:37] not with the outside man but from the
[57:39] inside if there's something there that
[57:41] can be contacted by faith and faith
[57:43] reaches out and what does it do you
[57:45] catch the word and it sends you into
[57:47] another dimension
[57:48] he said it makes it so real to him till
[57:50] it's he's just as good as god in his
[57:52] hands he knows it's going to happen
[57:55] right
[57:57] so of course satan's going to battle
[57:59] that
[58:00] through reason and affection and emotion
[58:03] right and so we had the question you
[58:05] know why sometimes when you come to the
[58:07] prayer line
[58:08] you feel good and other times you come
[58:09] to a prayer line you feel bad yeah sure
[58:12] i stood in prayer lines with a headache
[58:16] myself praying for people
[58:18] i stood in prayer lines so where you
[58:19] can't hardly stand up
[58:23] and not just from praying for people
[58:25] because you're so sick
[58:27] yet you're praying for people you say
[58:28] how is that possible well jesus did that
[58:31] yeah brother branham said he sat by the
[58:32] side of the road with a headache
[58:36] because he was human like we are
[58:38] sitting on the side of the road with a
[58:39] headache
[58:40] and he said that the widows came by and
[58:43] her son had passed away and the funeral
[58:45] procession was going by he gets up
[58:47] goes and raises the dead yeah
[58:50] goes back with the same headache and
[58:51] sits down on the side of the road right
[58:53] now
[58:54] because he was human
[58:56] right and so but what happens is many
[58:59] times we think well these other things
[59:01] are present so there must i know it's
[59:02] your faith that that context god it's
[59:05] not whether you feel good or bad it's
[59:07] not how loud you shout although many
[59:09] times faith will cause you to shout
[59:11] right faith will cause you to to reach
[59:13] out and do those things but faith itself
[59:16] is the substance of things hoped for
[59:18] it's not any of these other feelings or
[59:21] or any other uh any other contact that
[59:24] you have
[59:25] but yet god uses that and i'm gonna show
[59:27] you that in a moment now
[59:28] so now
[59:29] he said he knows it's gonna happen now
[59:32] you know some people might say well
[59:34] brother ben i think we'll just forget
[59:36] about these meetings
[59:38] we'll just forget about
[59:40] having good services we'll forget about
[59:41] atmosphere we'll forget about all these
[59:43] things because it's faith anyway
[59:47] and faith and we don't contact god by
[59:48] our earthly by our earthly uh
[59:51] senses and that's true
[59:53] and someone told with ron spencer said
[59:55] he said well i'm afraid i'll get in the
[59:57] flesh he said what else you gonna get in
[1:00:01] you're in the flesh right
[1:00:03] but you know you
[1:00:04] you think that way sometimes i said well
[1:00:06] you know i went to the meeting and and i
[1:00:08] was prayed for and i come right across
[1:00:10] the prayer line and
[1:00:11] and i felt good but then i got home and
[1:00:13] i felt bad so i must not have done
[1:00:14] anything
[1:00:15] i went to the prayer line i got prayed
[1:00:17] for and ended up with coping
[1:00:21] i come through and and maybe i felt
[1:00:23] worse when i left
[1:00:25] well of course you would the devil's
[1:00:26] going to fight you
[1:00:28] right because it took faith to come to
[1:00:30] the prayer line
[1:00:31] right and so now
[1:00:33] you say well i get what i'll do is i'll
[1:00:35] just i'll just have faith alone i won't
[1:00:37] have any of these other other things
[1:00:39] i'll just believe
[1:00:40] and then i'll just sit quietly and i
[1:00:42] won't go to church i won't i won't try
[1:00:44] to get into the atmosphere of the spirit
[1:00:46] because it doesn't do any good but now
[1:00:48] watch god does use those things remember
[1:00:51] those are
[1:00:53] they're not good or bad
[1:00:55] emotions are not good or bad
[1:00:57] they can be good or bad depending on
[1:00:59] depending on where it's coming from
[1:01:01] where that influence is coming from
[1:01:03] the same you can have an emotion of love
[1:01:06] that's a good thing
[1:01:08] you can have an emotion of hatred
[1:01:11] that's a bad thing
[1:01:13] what satan brings one god brings the
[1:01:15] other yes
[1:01:16] well brother ben how will i know the
[1:01:17] difference stay with the word
[1:01:20] if it agrees with the word you accept it
[1:01:22] yes if it disagrees with the word you
[1:01:24] reject it right that's why you might
[1:01:26] come like i said there might be a even
[1:01:28] in the prayer line sometimes even with
[1:01:30] the angel the lord will come and you'll
[1:01:32] feel a dread you'll feel a strange
[1:01:35] feeling and sometimes it's the angel of
[1:01:36] the lord sometimes it's the devil trying
[1:01:38] to fight you sometimes it's a spirit
[1:01:40] left over because remember when spirits
[1:01:42] are cast out they look for someone else
[1:01:44] to go into
[1:01:45] that's right and they're looking for
[1:01:47] people with doubt
[1:01:48] remember that but just because you feel
[1:01:50] it don't mean you have to accept it
[1:01:53] are you hearing me this morning just
[1:01:55] because you feel bad don't mean you have
[1:01:56] to be sick
[1:01:58] just because you feel like well i i feel
[1:02:00] this way i better not go to church you
[1:02:02] know don't you realize that's just what
[1:02:04] the devil wants you to do
[1:02:08] oh my but we want to overcome don't we
[1:02:11] now so you say well i'll just forsake
[1:02:13] the senses of the flesh and of the
[1:02:15] spirit and go straight to faith okay
[1:02:17] let's read romans 10 17 because then
[1:02:19] you'd need to know how would we get
[1:02:20] faith
[1:02:22] how would we get faith if you're going
[1:02:23] to forsake what you hear and what you
[1:02:25] see i just won't listen to nothing i
[1:02:27] won't hear nothing i won't get involved
[1:02:29] in none of the meetings
[1:02:30] come on
[1:02:32] i won't get involved in none of that
[1:02:33] i'll just sit here
[1:02:35] won't say man i'll just wait on faith
[1:02:37] faith comes by
[1:02:41] now i thought that was one of the five
[1:02:42] senses
[1:02:44] do you ever think about that
[1:02:47] we actually get faith
[1:02:50] by hearing
[1:02:52] and hearing by the word of god now
[1:02:54] god uses our hearing
[1:02:58] he's doing it right now
[1:03:00] he uses our hearing have you ever
[1:03:02] listened to a a tape of the prophet
[1:03:04] listen to a message of brother branham
[1:03:06] saying you and your faith just begins to
[1:03:08] build and begin to build i noticed in
[1:03:10] the meetings when we played the tape
[1:03:11] before saturday night servants of faith
[1:03:13] just began to build begin to build maybe
[1:03:15] you listen to some other preacher or you
[1:03:17] listen to one of our services your faith
[1:03:18] just begins to build why faith comes by
[1:03:20] hearing
[1:03:22] faith comes by hearing
[1:03:24] god uses that sense
[1:03:27] and what you don't realize is god uses
[1:03:29] all of these senses
[1:03:30] to get to you
[1:03:32] sometimes you have a feeling there's a
[1:03:34] touch there's a
[1:03:35] whatever that it is god can use that
[1:03:38] to contact you and and i'll prove that
[1:03:40] to you because he did use that when he
[1:03:41] come to earth
[1:03:43] we handled god
[1:03:45] humanity touched god
[1:03:48] humanity smelled god
[1:03:52] he did he eats them up just like any
[1:03:54] other man
[1:03:55] humanity humanity was able to see god
[1:04:00] oh my but they could only know who he
[1:04:01] was
[1:04:03] by faith
[1:04:06] who am i
[1:04:07] and now so each one of these five senses
[1:04:10] of the body and the five senses of the
[1:04:11] spirit bringing good and evil to the
[1:04:12] mind remember that's where the
[1:04:14] battleground is romans 7 14 let's look
[1:04:16] at this this morning again i'm just just
[1:04:18] want to bring this teaching so that we
[1:04:20] many times the devil try to beat you up
[1:04:22] after you come through a meeting and
[1:04:24] and we've seen him do it haven't we and
[1:04:26] but it's not just here but he'll make
[1:04:28] you think that well it's just here but
[1:04:29] it's everywhere right now
[1:04:31] it's everywhere but but that's just
[1:04:33] satan i've seen it over and over and
[1:04:34] over again somebody get a real blessing
[1:04:36] from god somebody's family get a real
[1:04:38] blessing from god and satan will come
[1:04:40] right in and begin to attack the church
[1:04:42] attack the family attack the pastor
[1:04:44] attack the people why do they do that
[1:04:46] why does he do that and see if we
[1:04:48] recognize that we begin to fight yes
[1:04:51] if we don't recognize it we just give in
[1:04:53] well i guess i didn't get my healing
[1:04:55] and many people left brother branham's
[1:04:58] prayer line
[1:04:59] and had cancer
[1:05:01] and the spirit of the lord spoke to them
[1:05:03] and said if you believe it you can be
[1:05:04] healed told them what it was
[1:05:07] and they went home but the bill and felt
[1:05:09] worse
[1:05:11] they felt worse than what they felt
[1:05:12] before
[1:05:14] well i guess i didn't get it i guess
[1:05:16] there's no use going to church but see
[1:05:18] if they understood and brother brown
[1:05:19] would take time to explain it to him he
[1:05:20] said if you understand he said that
[1:05:22] cancer dies
[1:05:24] in the body he said when that spirit
[1:05:25] leaves it it becomes just a lump of
[1:05:26] flesh and has to purge itself out of the
[1:05:28] body you actually feel worse
[1:05:31] and if you and if you begin to doubt
[1:05:33] it'll come back seven times worse
[1:05:36] oh my and so we don't want to do that
[1:05:38] today we need to understand these things
[1:05:40] romans 7 and 14 paul says we know the
[1:05:42] law is spiritual but i am carnal
[1:05:46] sold under sin now this is this is an
[1:05:48] important thing to understand
[1:05:50] this body's carnal yes amen sure
[1:05:53] it is carnal
[1:05:55] you got to protect yourself
[1:05:58] from yourself
[1:06:00] amen
[1:06:03] well i'm predestined brother ben i'll be
[1:06:04] oh no you've got to work paul said i
[1:06:06] keep under my body
[1:06:08] bring it under subjection list at any
[1:06:10] time i would be disapproved
[1:06:12] right i'm carnal
[1:06:15] verse 17
[1:06:16] romans 7 15 for that which i do
[1:06:19] i allow not
[1:06:21] so in other words i'm not going to get
[1:06:22] sick i'm not going to get sick i'm going
[1:06:24] to believe i'm going to work i'm going
[1:06:25] to do the thing i'm going to be at
[1:06:26] church i'm going to live for god
[1:06:29] he finds yourself
[1:06:31] circumstances get in your way
[1:06:34] sicknesses get in the way
[1:06:36] say well
[1:06:37] there must be something wrong with me
[1:06:38] well that's just you you're human
[1:06:42] right that which i do i allow not
[1:06:46] not gonna get this well we had a lot of
[1:06:47] brave people when coveted first hits you
[1:06:49] know
[1:06:51] that's god the bride can't get it
[1:06:55] until they got it and then that changed
[1:06:59] well that quote where brother branham
[1:07:00] talks about it or whether in the
[1:07:01] scripture says i'll bring none of these
[1:07:03] diseases that strike the egyptians
[1:07:04] everybody's like praise god it's not
[1:07:06] going to hit me well i appreciate your
[1:07:07] faith but you know then it the story
[1:07:10] changed once people started getting it
[1:07:11] but the body's carnal
[1:07:13] you can get any cold including the
[1:07:15] coronavirus
[1:07:17] that's right
[1:07:19] and
[1:07:20] the cold is a coronavirus a certain type
[1:07:22] and so as far if i understand that
[1:07:24] correctly which my medical knowledge is
[1:07:26] very limited so i try not to give
[1:07:28] medical advice
[1:07:29] but what i do i allow not
[1:07:31] for what i would that do i not but what
[1:07:34] i hate that do i
[1:07:36] now we're not talking now about going
[1:07:37] out
[1:07:38] in some kind of major sin we're talking
[1:07:40] about just everyday life
[1:07:42] paul's talking here as a christian
[1:07:45] not as an unbeliever as a christian
[1:07:47] i've got to overcome my body
[1:07:51] oh my he said now he said if then i do
[1:07:54] that which i would not i consent to the
[1:07:56] law that it is good so god's god's word
[1:07:59] is right
[1:08:00] he said now then it is no more i that do
[1:08:03] it but sin that dwelleth in me
[1:08:05] for i know that in me that is in my
[1:08:08] flesh i love the way he qualifies that
[1:08:11] in my flesh dwelleth no good thing
[1:08:15] for to will is present with me but how
[1:08:18] to perform that which is good i find not
[1:08:22] now again this doesn't give you an
[1:08:23] excuse and we'll go on and see where
[1:08:24] paul tells us we can overcome
[1:08:27] right we can live with god we can walk
[1:08:29] with god
[1:08:30] but but we can only do that by faith in
[1:08:32] the word
[1:08:33] now watch he said for the good that i
[1:08:35] would would i do not he said but the
[1:08:38] evil which i would not that i do
[1:08:40] now if i do that i would not it is no
[1:08:42] more i that do it but sin that dwelleth
[1:08:45] in me i find then a law that when i
[1:08:47] would do good evil is present with me so
[1:08:49] he said this is
[1:08:50] this is a law in other words it's always
[1:08:53] true
[1:08:54] any time you do good evil is present
[1:08:59] job is living his best life now
[1:09:02] yes to use a common phrase
[1:09:05] he's out there
[1:09:06] man health wealth and prosperity and
[1:09:08] doing so well and god has blessed him
[1:09:10] and and his family is doing good
[1:09:13] everybody's doing so well and and he's a
[1:09:15] believer he's a perfect man the bible
[1:09:18] says
[1:09:19] a perfect man and satan was still able
[1:09:22] to come before god and accuse job
[1:09:26] oh my why because evil is present it's
[1:09:28] the law it's where we live it's why
[1:09:30] we're here
[1:09:32] yes i'm gonna show you that in a moment
[1:09:34] in the message
[1:09:35] the lord helps me this morning to get
[1:09:36] through this now
[1:09:37] he said i find then
[1:09:39] a law when i would do good evil as
[1:09:41] present with me he said for i delight in
[1:09:44] the law of god after the inward man
[1:09:46] but i see another law in my members
[1:09:48] warring against the law of my mind and
[1:09:50] bringing me into captivity to the law of
[1:09:52] sin which is in my members
[1:09:54] he said oh wretched man that i am
[1:09:58] who shall deliver me
[1:10:00] from the body of this death so he wasn't
[1:10:02] okay with it
[1:10:04] he wasn't making excuses
[1:10:06] he said who shall deliver me
[1:10:08] how can i overcome
[1:10:10] how can i do that we don't just use it
[1:10:11] as an excuse well my flesh you know
[1:10:13] commits adultery my flesh my flesh goes
[1:10:16] out and smokes cigarettes but it's not
[1:10:17] me i don't want to he said who shall
[1:10:19] deliver me
[1:10:21] there is a deliverance amen there is a
[1:10:23] control tower there is something that
[1:10:25] can take over and rule your life
[1:10:28] as you yield to it right
[1:10:30] so he said now
[1:10:31] o wretched man that i am but he said i
[1:10:33] thank god
[1:10:35] oh how many are thankful for jesus
[1:10:37] christ today i thank god through jesus
[1:10:39] christ our lord so then with the mind
[1:10:42] remember the random tells us that that
[1:10:43] mind he said it's the it's just it's the
[1:10:46] heart yes and if you go back to the
[1:10:48] original greek or that paul is writing
[1:10:50] in he's not talking about just thinking
[1:10:53] but the will
[1:10:55] my will my my heart my mind i serve the
[1:10:58] law of god
[1:11:00] that's the way a real christian is
[1:11:02] with my will you can tell where a
[1:11:04] person's will is at where their heart is
[1:11:06] that many of you that are watching this
[1:11:07] morning but your heart is to be in the
[1:11:09] house of god your heart is to do right
[1:11:11] but now with the flesh you serve the law
[1:11:13] of sin you get sick you have problems
[1:11:16] it's there
[1:11:18] oh my
[1:11:19] but the brandon has asked
[1:11:21] actually two different times what this
[1:11:22] means and in the first time the first
[1:11:25] time he's asked that that's when he
[1:11:26] explains about the mind i believe that's
[1:11:28] in 1959 and questions and answers but
[1:11:30] the one i'm going to read is from 1964.
[1:11:32] he's asked the same question what does
[1:11:33] this mean
[1:11:35] he's talking about paul he said in me is
[1:11:37] two persons
[1:11:38] right one wants me to do wrong
[1:11:41] the other he said one right one wants me
[1:11:44] to do
[1:11:45] wrong the other one wants me to do
[1:11:47] and every time i start to do right
[1:11:50] then the wrong hinders me
[1:11:52] how many times
[1:11:55] every time
[1:11:57] we all ought to be able to understand
[1:11:59] that right
[1:12:00] so you have a good meeting guess what's
[1:12:02] going to happen
[1:12:05] right we should just expect that
[1:12:08] you your son or daughter gets saved gets
[1:12:10] baptized guess what's going to happen
[1:12:14] the devil's going to do everything he
[1:12:15] can to keep you out of church because
[1:12:17] when you started coming to church
[1:12:20] god began to bless you and so what's the
[1:12:22] devil going to do he's going to try
[1:12:24] keeping you out
[1:12:26] that's what he does
[1:12:28] and again i'm not condemning you this
[1:12:29] morning but just to to help us
[1:12:31] understand this is the devil
[1:12:34] but god is greater than the devil he
[1:12:36] that is in you is greater than he that's
[1:12:38] in the world
[1:12:40] brother branham illustrates it in 1959
[1:12:42] when in questions and answers when they
[1:12:44] talk he talks to him he says i didn't
[1:12:46] feel like coming to church today my
[1:12:47] throat was scratchy i was tired i was
[1:12:49] sick he said but then
[1:12:51] he said i said well i'll just let
[1:12:52] brother neville preach he said but he
[1:12:54] said i realized that was my flesh
[1:12:55] talking
[1:12:56] he said so i come here with my heart was
[1:12:59] to be with you people so he said i come
[1:13:01] here to my post of duty and he talked
[1:13:02] about how he had to hold on to the
[1:13:03] pulpit to preach
[1:13:05] but it was his supposed duty he was
[1:13:07] standing and why he was overcoming yes
[1:13:09] right and that's what you're doing this
[1:13:11] morning you're overcoming some of you're
[1:13:12] overcoming just by listening
[1:13:14] just by staying awake you're overcoming
[1:13:16] but praise god for that in whatever area
[1:13:19] you can overcome and do that
[1:13:22] beat that devil back
[1:13:24] defeat that devil come on
[1:13:28] of course he's going to fight you you
[1:13:30] got the different uniform on
[1:13:32] what do you expect you go out there with
[1:13:34] a different uniform you're going to get
[1:13:35] shot if you go out there in a war in the
[1:13:37] middle of a war zone you go out there
[1:13:39] with a ukrainian uniform and the
[1:13:40] russians see they're going to shoot you
[1:13:42] you go out there with an american
[1:13:44] uniform or a blue uniform in the civil
[1:13:46] war and the gray sees you they're going
[1:13:47] to shoot you wait what you should expect
[1:13:49] that
[1:13:50] you got a uniform on you've been
[1:13:52] baptized with the holy ghost you've been
[1:13:54] saved by the power of god when you're
[1:13:56] walking in this uniform he's going to
[1:13:58] take shots at you but you serve a
[1:14:00] greater god you got bigger weapons amen
[1:14:04] you've got god on your side you and god
[1:14:06] is the majority do we believe that today
[1:14:09] amen don't give in to him
[1:14:12] hallelujah
[1:14:14] so now
[1:14:16] you you know that you families know that
[1:14:18] every time you try to come to church one
[1:14:20] of the kids will get sick
[1:14:22] one of them will get hurt
[1:14:24] every time
[1:14:28] they're coming to church but jeremy
[1:14:30] knows what i'm talking about you start
[1:14:32] coming to church and every time if
[1:14:33] you're ever going to get aggravated at
[1:14:35] people for being late it's going to be
[1:14:36] sunday morning
[1:14:38] right well my wife and i take two
[1:14:40] separate vehicles
[1:14:42] and she's never late but she ain't as
[1:14:44] early as i am
[1:14:47] but you see that satan's gonna do that
[1:14:50] that's why you start preparing on
[1:14:51] saturday night
[1:14:53] i'm going to church tomorrow
[1:14:57] but it's just it's helping you to
[1:14:58] overcome but see it's faith that causes
[1:15:00] you to overcome now brother branham says
[1:15:02] this he says every time i start to do
[1:15:05] right then the wrong hinders me he said
[1:15:06] you're an outward man which is
[1:15:08] controlled by six senses now he calls it
[1:15:11] six here it's it's five he's including
[1:15:13] faith this is the sixth senses he said
[1:15:15] you're an inward man controlled by one
[1:15:16] sense which is faith and this faith
[1:15:18] disagrees with all six senses that the
[1:15:21] sixth sense doesn't agree with faith but
[1:15:23] one is contrary to the other as long as
[1:15:25] the sixth sense is agree with the faith
[1:15:27] wonderful but when the sixth sense
[1:15:29] disagrees with faith
[1:15:31] leave the six senses alone
[1:15:34] right those body senses
[1:15:36] i had a chart somewhere i preached right
[1:15:38] past it i think
[1:15:40] but there's a you know there's the
[1:15:41] outside body there's there's five senses
[1:15:43] of that when it agrees with the word
[1:15:46] yeah
[1:15:47] that's all right
[1:15:48] sometimes we feel embarrassed say well
[1:15:50] yeah i felt too good about that must
[1:15:53] just be getting in the flesh
[1:15:55] was it the word
[1:15:58] i can't believe that person had shouted
[1:15:59] like that i can't believe they they
[1:16:01] danced in the spirit was it the word
[1:16:04] was it because of healing was it because
[1:16:05] of salvation
[1:16:07] see what was it about
[1:16:09] if they danced because somebody touched
[1:16:11] them there it is that's because a
[1:16:12] certain preacher touched them that's
[1:16:13] something different come on yes they
[1:16:15] danced because of the music that's
[1:16:17] something different we heard about that
[1:16:18] this weekend well we're not dancing over
[1:16:20] the music we're dancing because of the
[1:16:21] word
[1:16:22] the word is present
[1:16:24] so i think brother ron malevo my friend
[1:16:26] in the philippines for this this thing
[1:16:28] he brought this one up and i thought it
[1:16:30] was good but inside of inside there's a
[1:16:32] soul that soul is is only ruled by faith
[1:16:35] or doubt yeah right that that's your
[1:16:37] will you have the you have the ability
[1:16:40] to accept or reject anything that comes
[1:16:43] in your senses
[1:16:44] anything
[1:16:45] on the outside is all the things of the
[1:16:47] world all the things you hear all the
[1:16:48] things you smell all the things you see
[1:16:50] all the things you feel all the things
[1:16:52] you taste yeah
[1:16:54] you say well what does smell have to do
[1:16:56] with that and take the smallest one
[1:16:57] probably the most inconsequential one
[1:16:59] have you ever smelled something and it
[1:17:00] reminded you
[1:17:03] right because she smells sometimes works
[1:17:05] on your memory
[1:17:07] and your memory can work on your
[1:17:08] affection
[1:17:10] right you smelled something then you
[1:17:12] remember something you think oh god i
[1:17:14] wish i could forget that
[1:17:16] but it stays in your mind then maybe
[1:17:18] satan will arrange it so that you meet a
[1:17:19] certain person or you do a certain thing
[1:17:21] what's he trying to do but if it's not
[1:17:23] the word reject it yes
[1:17:26] that's why we don't you know it's
[1:17:28] possible in this outer realm to hear
[1:17:32] and to feel
[1:17:33] that you're in love
[1:17:34] with somebody who's not your wife
[1:17:38] or your husband
[1:17:40] it's possible even on that inner realm
[1:17:41] it's possible to have affection oh i'm
[1:17:44] in love
[1:17:46] what does the soul say
[1:17:48] what does the inner man say what does
[1:17:50] the word say
[1:17:52] right you don't go you don't stay
[1:17:53] married because of these two outer
[1:17:55] realms
[1:17:56] not as christians
[1:17:58] and that's why sometimes we we try to
[1:18:00] manage things we're managing the well
[1:18:03] i'm way off my notes this morning but
[1:18:04] we're we're managing the effects
[1:18:08] of an inner problem
[1:18:10] psychology works in this middle realm
[1:18:13] right it works in here and all it can do
[1:18:15] is affect that but that satan can use
[1:18:17] that anyway
[1:18:18] changing that inner realm it's not going
[1:18:20] to make you a believer right changing
[1:18:23] that in a realm it's not going to make
[1:18:24] you know it's got to be the soul there's
[1:18:26] got to be and there's got to be
[1:18:27] representation on the very inside of the
[1:18:29] inside that agrees with the word and
[1:18:31] when it does there's something inside of
[1:18:33] you that fights for the word
[1:18:36] amen and when that seed is awakened by
[1:18:39] the water of the holy spirit yes it
[1:18:41] begins to grow in your life
[1:18:43] and begins to take over
[1:18:46] it's dominant
[1:18:48] the seed is not oh god
[1:18:51] it does not lay back it's not a servant
[1:18:54] to the outer realm
[1:18:56] but the seed when it's watered by the
[1:18:58] holy spirit
[1:18:59] is dominant if you don't feel that in
[1:19:01] your life if you don't have that in your
[1:19:02] life you need to come back and get get
[1:19:04] washed again you need to come back and
[1:19:06] get filled refilled with the holy spirit
[1:19:08] because when you are yielding to the
[1:19:10] holy spirit that is dominant in your
[1:19:12] life you can't you can't think of
[1:19:14] anything or you can't do anything else
[1:19:15] it just controls you yes these other
[1:19:18] things come but you just can't make that
[1:19:20] decision
[1:19:21] what keeps you from doing that there but
[1:19:23] by the grace of god would i would go but
[1:19:25] the grace of god poured the holy ghost
[1:19:27] out on your soul to produce a dominant
[1:19:29] force a control tower in your life
[1:19:32] when that dominant force is not
[1:19:34] operating in our lives we need the holy
[1:19:36] ghost
[1:19:39] can we say amen to that this morning
[1:19:43] well how you saying boy i wish brother
[1:19:44] wendell was back this morning
[1:19:46] brother wendell preaches like it's in
[1:19:47] his church so
[1:19:52] i don't know about brother andrew but
[1:19:56] how don't you did you love the ministry
[1:19:58] this weekend i know i did i sat down
[1:20:00] here man i enjoyed that
[1:20:02] i enjoyed that thoroughly i what a
[1:20:04] blessing
[1:20:06] now
[1:20:06] brother brandon said that's the same
[1:20:08] thing he said
[1:20:10] the inside for instance he said jesus
[1:20:11] made a statement if you can find me
[1:20:13] again i'm sorry
[1:20:15] he said for instance now for instance
[1:20:16] here
[1:20:17] jesus made a statement oh you found it
[1:20:19] quick a promise he said the inside man
[1:20:21] says that that's true if jesus said
[1:20:23] something that's true he said the
[1:20:25] outside man reasons
[1:20:27] that it can't be true to you
[1:20:29] oh my he said then ignore the outside
[1:20:32] man and accept the inside man
[1:20:35] hallelujah he said now that's the same
[1:20:37] thing that paul is speaking of he was
[1:20:38] sold under the law to carnal sin every
[1:20:41] one of us
[1:20:42] is the same
[1:20:44] he said that's the reason we have the
[1:20:46] troubles we do
[1:20:47] oh listen church
[1:20:49] why did i have to go through what i did
[1:20:50] because of those outer realms
[1:20:52] i'm married four or five times he said
[1:20:55] this that all kinds of sin and
[1:20:56] adulteries everything else along in our
[1:20:58] lives is because of those things
[1:21:01] we are carnal and that part must perish
[1:21:05] you realize that can't even go to heaven
[1:21:07] you got to have a body change for you to
[1:21:09] go to heaven
[1:21:10] you wouldn't be you wouldn't be
[1:21:12] acceptable in heaven the way you are
[1:21:15] i wouldn't be acceptable in heaven the
[1:21:16] way i am i must have a body change but
[1:21:19] i'm so grateful there's one already
[1:21:21] waiting
[1:21:22] i'm not the sum of my mistakes i'm not
[1:21:24] the son of my outside man i'm not i'm
[1:21:27] not a reflection of what my what i've
[1:21:29] been through in the past but i'm a
[1:21:30] reflection of a word that was in god's
[1:21:33] mind a thought that was in his mind to
[1:21:34] become a word body and one day i'm going
[1:21:37] back to pick up that body
[1:21:38] yes sir
[1:21:40] good
[1:21:41] glory
[1:21:43] i'm never going to get through all this
[1:21:44] but i'll i'll quit when it's time to
[1:21:45] quit
[1:21:47] whenever that is
[1:21:51] he gonna let me know
[1:21:54] all
[1:21:54] right praise god for brother joel
[1:21:58] brother brown said we are carnal
[1:22:00] and that part must perish
[1:22:02] must perish
[1:22:04] but then inside we are a spirit man soul
[1:22:06] inside he said and that's faith in god's
[1:22:08] word now if you go back and you get
[1:22:10] greatest battle ever fought brother
[1:22:12] branham talks about the spirit being the
[1:22:13] inside man but random it just changes
[1:22:15] the terminology it doesn't change the
[1:22:17] teaching but it changes the terminology
[1:22:19] that's what most denominations teach
[1:22:21] this is the spirit is the inside man
[1:22:22] then the soul and the body
[1:22:24] but now brother branham in 1963 changes
[1:22:26] that and he changes it over to uh to
[1:22:30] body spirit and soul with the soul being
[1:22:33] on the inside
[1:22:34] now he said
[1:22:36] he said then we bring our outside body
[1:22:38] he said soul inside that's faith in
[1:22:39] god's word then we bring our outside
[1:22:40] body under subjection to the word by
[1:22:43] faith by accepting what god said he said
[1:22:46] how can i take a cockle burn make a
[1:22:48] grain of wheat out of it it's impossible
[1:22:50] for me to do it
[1:22:52] you're never going to make a grain of
[1:22:53] wheat out of the flesh
[1:22:55] yes sir the only way it can be
[1:22:58] wait he said well it's impossible but
[1:23:00] wait
[1:23:01] oh my it can have the life of the wheat
[1:23:04] yes
[1:23:05] or until like i said it's dominated
[1:23:08] by the holy ghost
[1:23:09] the only way it can be is because inside
[1:23:12] that cockapoo has been transmitted from
[1:23:13] a cocklebur wheat a cockapoor to a germ
[1:23:16] called wheat life
[1:23:18] he said then you bury that cocoa bear
[1:23:19] and it'll produce a grain of wheat
[1:23:22] glory because the shell
[1:23:25] is not what the life is
[1:23:28] glory all the shell shows is that one
[1:23:30] day there was another life but if you
[1:23:32] trans
[1:23:33] take the life out and put another life
[1:23:35] in it there's a new life and it's going
[1:23:37] to produce a new shell
[1:23:39] that ought to make some of you old
[1:23:40] people feel good
[1:23:43] my mom turned old this week and
[1:23:47] i won't say how old
[1:23:48] but that'll make her feel good
[1:23:51] i think she's left the building
[1:23:55] when you turn old
[1:23:57] it ought to make you feel good to know
[1:24:00] there's another body waiting
[1:24:02] amen that old cockleburst shell is
[1:24:04] rotting away but there's another body
[1:24:06] waiting
[1:24:08] he said and the life of the cocklebur
[1:24:10] has been taken out but the nature of the
[1:24:12] cocker bird is still sticky and it will
[1:24:13] be
[1:24:14] until this new life has fully been
[1:24:17] developed
[1:24:18] glory out of the ground and raised up
[1:24:21] again
[1:24:22] when it comes forth then it's no more
[1:24:24] huckleberry but wheat but while it's
[1:24:26] here on earth
[1:24:28] and a cockapoo it's still sticky
[1:24:31] that's why if you stay with one person
[1:24:33] long enough you're going to get sticky
[1:24:35] is that right brother joel
[1:24:38] you go on a trip with somebody sleep on
[1:24:40] some airport floors
[1:24:42] we're going to show that to you tonight
[1:24:43] and hopefully everybody be able to watch
[1:24:45] at least but but we uh we slept on some
[1:24:48] airport floors
[1:24:49] we didn't get to take a shower
[1:24:51] and we ended up
[1:24:52] ended up in egypt and in a place where
[1:24:55] we didn't realize there was no no air
[1:24:56] conditioning where we were going and
[1:24:58] it's quite hot and and you get two or
[1:25:00] three people actually there's four of us
[1:25:01] brothers that were there plus brother
[1:25:03] mcgalley and brother george the
[1:25:04] interpreter so six of us all kind of
[1:25:07] staying together we were just hanging
[1:25:08] out every day together i i won't deny
[1:25:11] that there was some stickiness
[1:25:15] you need to go on a mission trip
[1:25:17] sometimes
[1:25:19] there's some stickiness why is there
[1:25:20] stickiness
[1:25:22] because we're human
[1:25:24] i was so blessed to see all the
[1:25:25] different pastors saturday night in the
[1:25:27] meetings wasn't that wonderful
[1:25:28] see all the different pastors in the
[1:25:30] media so blessed to see that almost all
[1:25:32] the pastors in the area the ones that
[1:25:34] didn't come contacted me personally and
[1:25:36] said we wish we could have been there
[1:25:38] and all of them here in the meeting i
[1:25:39] was so blessed by that but you know why
[1:25:42] you know it gets sticky sometimes in the
[1:25:43] back rooms
[1:25:45] you get all the preachers i just love to
[1:25:47] put them all together
[1:25:49] but they're stickiness you see them on
[1:25:51] preachers yes
[1:25:53] why
[1:25:54] it's coco bear
[1:25:57] the outside of a preacher is still
[1:25:58] sticky
[1:26:00] sorry to disappoint you but it's true
[1:26:02] but on the on the inside there's a
[1:26:04] nature of a wheat if we could ever learn
[1:26:06] to look past the outside we could ever
[1:26:09] learn to get past this sickness and let
[1:26:11] the the power of the holy spirit so
[1:26:13] dominate our lives until we could begin
[1:26:15] to get along with one another
[1:26:17] oh my gosh he said now
[1:26:20] he said he said as long as you're in
[1:26:21] this life you're going to be sticky and
[1:26:23] have a carnal nature that's going to
[1:26:24] bother you as long as you live
[1:26:27] he said but the inside of you you're
[1:26:28] born again
[1:26:29] and when you're raised up you're in the
[1:26:30] likeness of christ and all the sin has
[1:26:32] got from you now i'm going to get on
[1:26:34] something sticky here for a minute
[1:26:36] this is an important i gotta i wanted to
[1:26:38] read all of it but i won't brother brown
[1:26:40] talks about the indians
[1:26:42] and he talks about a black dog and a
[1:26:44] white dog
[1:26:45] and during that time it's very important
[1:26:48] brother joel to understand this properly
[1:26:51] there's a there's a
[1:26:53] i've even got a picture praise god
[1:26:55] i told my daughter i'm going to have a
[1:26:56] picture of dogs
[1:26:59] where's that she is back there i see
[1:27:01] after i got a picture dog in there
[1:27:02] fighting that looks like our two dogs
[1:27:04] our two dogs can't stand each other
[1:27:06] they got that woof nature still in them
[1:27:09] we got two dogs that do not get along
[1:27:12] and they're both just so sweet act so
[1:27:13] sweet when they're but as soon as food
[1:27:15] comes out
[1:27:17] they start attacking each other
[1:27:19] it's like preachers over a pulpit you
[1:27:20] know just
[1:27:21] just going at each other
[1:27:23] so the the black dog and the white dog
[1:27:27] can't get along
[1:27:29] right
[1:27:30] now
[1:27:31] brother branham said they asked the
[1:27:32] chief said chief which one of them wins
[1:27:34] the fight
[1:27:35] which one wins the fight said that
[1:27:37] depends on which one chief feeds the
[1:27:38] most
[1:27:41] he gets big and strong
[1:27:44] maybe we ought to try that
[1:27:47] i want him dogs take over the other dog
[1:27:50] he gets big and strong yeah the one you
[1:27:52] feed the most
[1:27:53] see if you feed the black dog
[1:27:56] hollywood
[1:27:57] all week
[1:27:58] and then you come sit in the church
[1:28:01] bless me preacher
[1:28:04] why is the preacher able to get under
[1:28:06] the anointing and sometimes the people
[1:28:07] aren't yeah well it's because the
[1:28:09] preacher knows or he should know he's
[1:28:11] got a responsibility to get a get out of
[1:28:13] those things
[1:28:14] and come under the holy spirit and so he
[1:28:16] spends part of but what kind of a church
[1:28:18] could we have
[1:28:20] if people would understand if i just
[1:28:22] quit feeding the black dog if i quit
[1:28:24] feeding my prejudices if i quit feeding
[1:28:27] my my
[1:28:28] my crisis if i could quit feeding my
[1:28:31] worries and my fears and my
[1:28:33] unforgiveness if i just let it go
[1:28:36] what would that do to the white dog he'd
[1:28:38] begin to grow
[1:28:39] he began to get bigger and be able to
[1:28:41] overcome he said it depends on which one
[1:28:43] he feeds the most
[1:28:45] amen amen he said so i think that's a
[1:28:47] good answer here there just depends on
[1:28:49] the warring of the body that's in you
[1:28:52] think about the warring of the body
[1:28:53] that's in you depends on which one you
[1:28:55] feed
[1:28:59] how you respond to that prayer line
[1:29:00] think about it yeah now you go from
[1:29:03] there but you've been fed under the
[1:29:05] atmosphere and you felt good but now
[1:29:06] you're going next week oh i'm sick i
[1:29:08] feel bad feel worse oh it must have been
[1:29:10] a mistake no you need to start feeding
[1:29:12] that white dog again
[1:29:14] you fed him during the meetings feed him
[1:29:15] at home
[1:29:17] feed him when you wake up in the morning
[1:29:18] feed him when you go to bed at night
[1:29:20] think on these things amen feed him he
[1:29:24] wants to be fed
[1:29:25] i told you it's dangerous territory
[1:29:29] feeling
[1:29:31] amen
[1:29:32] now this is not for the unconverted
[1:29:36] wish i could pound that down because
[1:29:39] many times unconverted people even our
[1:29:40] children they'll try to take this and
[1:29:42] when they really haven't had an
[1:29:43] experience with god they'll try to take
[1:29:45] to say well by psychology i'll come in
[1:29:47] and i'll just reject all these things
[1:29:49] that are wrong by the word you can't do
[1:29:50] it without the holy spirit
[1:29:52] because that dominating force hasn't
[1:29:54] been awakened
[1:29:56] and you will fail a hundred times out of
[1:29:58] a hundred unless you receive the baptism
[1:30:00] of the holy ghost
[1:30:02] you've got to have the baptism of the
[1:30:03] holy ghost in your life or you will fail
[1:30:06] in in doing these things
[1:30:08] but it's for the converted man how do we
[1:30:10] know that romans 8 and 1. just the next
[1:30:11] verse he said there is therefore now no
[1:30:13] condemnation to them which are in christ
[1:30:16] jesus who walk not after the flesh but
[1:30:18] after the spirit right
[1:30:20] now in order to be born again are you
[1:30:22] still with me this morning i got just a
[1:30:24] few more minutes and we'll we'll close
[1:30:26] now
[1:30:27] he said there is therefore now no
[1:30:28] condemnation now in order to be born
[1:30:30] again you must have representation in
[1:30:32] heaven
[1:30:33] representation how do you contact heaven
[1:30:36] now remember there there were many
[1:30:38] priests in jesus time that could not
[1:30:40] contact heaven they could not accept
[1:30:43] that he was god in flesh they couldn't
[1:30:45] see it
[1:30:46] so they come up with all kinds of
[1:30:48] theories they said he's beelzebub he's a
[1:30:50] good man he's a teacher whatever it is
[1:30:51] that they come up with but they could
[1:30:53] not see who he really was but there was
[1:30:55] a woman in a city of samaria called
[1:30:57] psychar she was down there by herself
[1:31:00] she didn't have any advantages at all
[1:31:02] but she heard the word one time on the
[1:31:04] side of a well yes
[1:31:07] and what did she do she said shirley
[1:31:10] you must be a prophet
[1:31:12] and she said when messiah comes
[1:31:14] oh my how did she get that revelation
[1:31:17] because inside of her brother random
[1:31:19] explains it in future home he said
[1:31:20] inside of her there was representation
[1:31:23] the priest didn't have that
[1:31:25] but she had representation
[1:31:27] oh my now look
[1:31:29] now there's representation that has to
[1:31:31] be there in second corinthians 5 and 1
[1:31:33] he said we know that if our earthly
[1:31:35] house our our cuckleber
[1:31:38] be dissolved
[1:31:39] if our earthly house of this tabernacle
[1:31:41] this tent
[1:31:43] or dissolved well that's the kind of
[1:31:44] tent doctrine i believe in
[1:31:46] this tent's gonna be done away with yes
[1:31:49] oh my i'm gonna take off the old coat
[1:31:51] put on anew
[1:31:53] he said if this tent were dissolved we
[1:31:55] have a building of god
[1:31:56] a house not made with hands eternal in
[1:31:59] the heavens if this tent is dissolved
[1:32:01] this temporary dwelling is dissolved we
[1:32:04] have an eternal dwelling a permanent
[1:32:06] dwelling on the other side
[1:32:09] think about it look at the language he
[1:32:10] uses if this tent is dissolved we have a
[1:32:14] building
[1:32:16] very bad
[1:32:17] a house not made with hands
[1:32:20] now brother branham calls this a word
[1:32:21] body or a theophany
[1:32:23] that's what's waiting in the heavens
[1:32:25] and we we're then now with the
[1:32:27] resurrection we're given another kind of
[1:32:29] body glorified body at the rapture and
[1:32:31] resurrection so we can live here and
[1:32:32] reign with the on earth for a thousand
[1:32:34] years
[1:32:35] now now paul talks about that body he
[1:32:37] said the first man is of the earth
[1:32:38] earthy of the earth earthy that's who we
[1:32:41] are
[1:32:42] it's no wonder we don't feel good
[1:32:44] yeah
[1:32:45] right the earth is cursed
[1:32:49] but divine healing what is divine
[1:32:50] healing it's just an
[1:32:52] earnest of permanent health
[1:32:56] you will get healed you could get healed
[1:32:58] and get sick five minutes later
[1:33:01] but it's just in earnest amen
[1:33:03] there is a body waiting in the heavens
[1:33:06] glory aren't you glad for that today
[1:33:09] oh if you lost your loved ones if you if
[1:33:11] you're in pain or worried because of the
[1:33:13] things that have happened you say well
[1:33:15] so many have gone on but remember
[1:33:16] they've just taken on their new body
[1:33:19] oh god they were earthy now they're
[1:33:22] heavenly he said such are they also that
[1:33:24] are heavenly as we have borne the image
[1:33:26] of the earthy we shall also bear the
[1:33:29] image of the heavenly yes verse 50 he
[1:33:32] said now this i say brethren that flesh
[1:33:34] and blood cannot someone say cannot
[1:33:37] inherit the kingdom of god neither does
[1:33:39] corruption inherit incorruption behold i
[1:33:42] show you a mystery we shall not all
[1:33:44] sleep but we shall all be changed
[1:33:47] in a moment in the twinkling of an eye
[1:33:49] at the last trump for the trumpet shall
[1:33:51] sound and the dead shall be raised
[1:33:53] incorruptable and we shall be changed
[1:33:56] what is it to take on this new house yes
[1:34:00] what did paul say we have one already
[1:34:02] waiting
[1:34:05] not going to be any you know they used
[1:34:06] to say
[1:34:08] they used to say an old hole in this
[1:34:09] church said well i don't want my mansion
[1:34:11] to go empty
[1:34:12] they built it for me all these years and
[1:34:14] then i backslide
[1:34:17] all these empty mansions god don't do
[1:34:19] things like that
[1:34:20] well i guess they'll use my material on
[1:34:22] somebody else's mansion now he's talking
[1:34:24] about tabernacles whether branham
[1:34:25] explained that to us and things that are
[1:34:27] to be
[1:34:28] tabernacles
[1:34:29] we have many tabernacles he has many
[1:34:31] tabernacles he's built them he's
[1:34:33] prepared them for us
[1:34:35] and in those tabernacles those
[1:34:37] tabernacles are is our bodies that we go
[1:34:39] to dwell in he has many kinds
[1:34:41] of bodies that we go to dwell in so i
[1:34:43] believe what you what you represent here
[1:34:45] you'll represent there i'm sorry for
[1:34:47] some of us but you know that don't look
[1:34:49] as good as some others but but there is
[1:34:52] a tabernacle that god wanted us for some
[1:34:54] reason to be this way
[1:34:56] amen
[1:34:58] praise god
[1:35:01] now look he said
[1:35:03] he he said we will be changed now
[1:35:06] everyone that has ears can hear the word
[1:35:10] right
[1:35:11] you hear it
[1:35:12] but brother ben you said faith comes by
[1:35:14] hearing that's how i contact heaven at
[1:35:16] home so if i hear a tape if i hear a
[1:35:18] preacher i should be able to have faith
[1:35:19] then and go home
[1:35:21] everyone that has ears
[1:35:24] natural ears can hear the word
[1:35:26] but it takes spiritual ears
[1:35:28] yes
[1:35:30] to hear from your theophany that's right
[1:35:33] everyone who has a spirit
[1:35:36] consents the emotions of his presence
[1:35:39] that's right yes sir yeah
[1:35:41] sometimes you can look at me and watch
[1:35:43] me preach or watch brother joel or watch
[1:35:45] these other ministers brother stewart or
[1:35:47] allen and we get under the anointing and
[1:35:48] we when we get under that our our
[1:35:50] emotions change
[1:35:52] you get very emotional sometimes under
[1:35:54] under the anointing of god and you'll
[1:35:56] see that and you see that emotion and
[1:35:58] you you partake in that
[1:36:00] you can partake in that and not be a
[1:36:01] child of god
[1:36:04] i've seen many people partaking that
[1:36:06] emotion
[1:36:07] and worship sometimes you'll see people
[1:36:09] come and they'll worship among us oh
[1:36:11] it's so wonderful and you look at their
[1:36:12] life and say how could could they
[1:36:14] possibly keep living like they do after
[1:36:16] being after being in his presence like
[1:36:18] that well it's just they've never
[1:36:20] there's not been anything ever strike
[1:36:21] that seed if there is one
[1:36:23] right but in you there's been a seed
[1:36:25] stroke so you're not just getting in the
[1:36:26] emotion of the preacher but yes you can
[1:36:28] sense it you can feel it and i don't
[1:36:30] care who you are when a preacher really
[1:36:32] gets under the anointing you say amen
[1:36:33] better
[1:36:35] i think sometimes we need to quit
[1:36:36] hollering at the people and start
[1:36:38] hollering at the preachers
[1:36:39] it's not the people's fault for not
[1:36:41] saying amen most time it's our fault
[1:36:45] because we don't show that we we
[1:36:47] that it matters to us
[1:36:49] that's true of singers by the way as
[1:36:51] well
[1:36:52] sometimes we don't show you know we
[1:36:54] ought to run that through our brain
[1:36:56] say i'm saved
[1:37:00] bless god brother ben i'm saved
[1:37:02] i don't even know how to do a deadpan
[1:37:04] really
[1:37:07] bless god i'm saved
[1:37:10] well that's wonderful
[1:37:12] but do you really believe it
[1:37:15] see if i was really worried about my
[1:37:17] child yeah
[1:37:18] oh god and they were going over the
[1:37:21] cliff going down the river and i knew
[1:37:22] there was a waterfall out in front of
[1:37:24] them and they were going over and i and
[1:37:25] there was my child i was concerned about
[1:37:27] them
[1:37:28] i wouldn't waste i would take all of my
[1:37:30] effort all of my strength all my emotion
[1:37:33] everything that i had to go get them to
[1:37:34] scream at them
[1:37:36] there's a there's a fall there's
[1:37:37] cataracts up ahead
[1:37:39] people say well it's just emotion sure
[1:37:41] it is
[1:37:42] but god is using that emotion
[1:37:45] yes sir oh god to be the voice of many
[1:37:48] waters calling you to christ
[1:37:52] oh he can't do that why can't he
[1:37:54] hearing's by the word of god
[1:37:57] god uses hearing god uses emotion but
[1:38:00] you got to watch because every emotion
[1:38:01] is not from god
[1:38:03] sure
[1:38:05] everyone who has a spirit can sense the
[1:38:07] emotions of his presence why are they
[1:38:08] not all born again
[1:38:11] now jesus was the son of god but he came
[1:38:13] first as a theophany let's get into that
[1:38:15] for just a moment before we leave he
[1:38:17] said now the different difference
[1:38:18] between him and you as a son see he was
[1:38:21] at the beginning the word and in morphy
[1:38:23] body
[1:38:24] he came in and lived in that in the
[1:38:26] person of melchizedek
[1:38:28] there should be no question about who
[1:38:30] melchizedek is after brother brown gets
[1:38:32] done preaching who is this melchizedek
[1:38:35] he was jesus christ
[1:38:38] he said then later we never heard no
[1:38:40] more melchizedek because he became jesus
[1:38:42] christ melchizedek was the priest but he
[1:38:45] became jesus christ
[1:38:47] now you bypassed that
[1:38:49] because in that form he knew all things
[1:38:52] and you have never been able to know
[1:38:55] that yet right oh praise god that gives
[1:38:58] me comfort brother danny
[1:39:00] none of us have ever been able to know
[1:39:02] all things
[1:39:03] right
[1:39:05] not even peter peter you don't know all
[1:39:06] things
[1:39:08] i got a quote for it
[1:39:10] the other quote
[1:39:13] he knowed all things and you have never
[1:39:15] been able to know that yet
[1:39:17] we ought to get off our high horse
[1:39:19] shouldn't we
[1:39:20] you come like adam like me
[1:39:23] oh my he wasn't jesus christ
[1:39:26] he was a man brother branham was a man
[1:39:29] jesus was god
[1:39:31] in flesh but the branham tabernacled god
[1:39:33] in flesh just like we do but jesus was
[1:39:36] the fullness of the godhead he said you
[1:39:38] come like adam like me like you can't
[1:39:40] become from the attribute to the flesh
[1:39:41] to be tempted to be tempted
[1:39:46] this week is why you're here
[1:39:50] are you hearing me now
[1:39:52] the the meetings are wonderful it's a
[1:39:53] taste it's an earnest of heaven
[1:39:56] but this week is why you're here
[1:39:58] you came to be tempted
[1:40:02] oh god
[1:40:03] if we just recognize that he said well
[1:40:04] if god was better to me
[1:40:06] if he treated my family better
[1:40:09] if i could feel that emotion all the
[1:40:11] time if i if i could sense his presence
[1:40:12] all the time listen
[1:40:14] you came to be tempted
[1:40:17] there's going to be times he withdraws
[1:40:18] his presence from you there's going to
[1:40:20] be times he'll make you work for it
[1:40:23] there's gonna be times he wants to hear
[1:40:24] you cry
[1:40:26] but you don't quit crying you keep
[1:40:27] crying you keep believing you don't quit
[1:40:30] believing you keep believing when the
[1:40:31] going gets tough hey man the tough get
[1:40:34] going do you believe it this morning
[1:40:38] hey man he said to be tempted but when
[1:40:39] this life is finished here
[1:40:41] oh my this earthly tabernacle be
[1:40:43] dissolved we have one already waiting
[1:40:45] that's where we go that is the word he
[1:40:47] said then we can look back and see what
[1:40:49] we've done he said now we don't
[1:40:51] understand it
[1:40:54] i wish we could
[1:40:55] brother ben i have to understand it we
[1:40:57] don't understand it
[1:40:59] because we were not born in a word body
[1:41:02] first
[1:41:04] come on now but the man explained it to
[1:41:06] me to my satisfaction i can't do that
[1:41:10] but you got to have faith
[1:41:12] we don't understand it we have never
[1:41:14] become the word we've just become the
[1:41:16] flesh man not the word
[1:41:18] but look clearly it makes it clear he
[1:41:20] said you'll never be the word i love
[1:41:22] this unless you was a thought at the
[1:41:24] beginning
[1:41:26] sometimes you say i speak without
[1:41:27] thinking that's actually impossible
[1:41:30] you thought about you might have thought
[1:41:31] about a long time ago
[1:41:35] you might come out and said you jerk
[1:41:39] oh i didn't think before i said that you
[1:41:41] thought about it at some point
[1:41:46] oh i'm going to get myself in trouble
[1:41:49] i'm sorry honey i didn't mean to say
[1:41:51] that i just wasn't thinking about it
[1:41:52] well at some point he was
[1:41:54] because it's literally impossible for a
[1:41:56] word to be expressed without a thought
[1:41:58] behind it but what a powerful thought
[1:42:02] that that is
[1:42:03] you had to be in the thinking
[1:42:05] oh my
[1:42:06] that's how you existed by the way
[1:42:08] brother branham taught us that those
[1:42:10] those souls that we existed we shouted
[1:42:12] for joy in god's mind
[1:42:14] but the random said we we did that in
[1:42:15] his mind
[1:42:16] right we existed that's the we don't
[1:42:18] believe in the pre-existence of souls
[1:42:19] like mormons we shouted in god's mind
[1:42:23] right we had to be a thought before we
[1:42:24] could become a word right
[1:42:27] glory amen you can't be the word and i
[1:42:29] don't know again because i don't know
[1:42:31] all things i wasn't in that fee off
[1:42:32] anybody i don't know what i've done or
[1:42:34] where i've been but i know this i came
[1:42:36] to earth and one day
[1:42:38] oh my i heard
[1:42:40] from something from the past
[1:42:43] are you hearing me now i heard the
[1:42:46] thought that had been expressed in a
[1:42:48] body
[1:42:49] see when jesus thought about you he
[1:42:50] didn't quit just thinking about you you
[1:42:52] were a thought then you were a
[1:42:54] word
[1:42:56] yeah think about it
[1:42:58] you can't be the word unless you're a
[1:42:59] thought
[1:43:00] you had to be in the thinking
[1:43:02] he said but you see in order to stand
[1:43:04] temptation you had to bypass the
[1:43:06] theophany
[1:43:07] you had to come down here in flesh to be
[1:43:09] tempted by sin
[1:43:12] and then if you stand oh my i love that
[1:43:14] if you stand
[1:43:15] all the father hath given me will come
[1:43:17] to me
[1:43:18] if you stand the temptation if you stand
[1:43:21] the trial and you will if you're a seed
[1:43:23] of god right yes sir if you stand all
[1:43:26] the fathers give me will come to me and
[1:43:27] i'll raise him up at the last days see
[1:43:29] you had to be first yes glory you had to
[1:43:32] exist in your current body first
[1:43:35] in order to be tempted he said and then
[1:43:37] you see he come right down the regular
[1:43:38] line from attribute before the
[1:43:39] foundation of the world his name is put
[1:43:41] on the lamb's book of life he said then
[1:43:42] from that he became the word the
[1:43:44] theophany that could appear disappear
[1:43:46] then he become flesh and return back
[1:43:47] again resurrected that same body in a
[1:43:50] glorified condition you realize jesus
[1:43:51] already has his glorified body
[1:43:54] yes
[1:43:56] he's a he's an intercessor for you and i
[1:43:59] he's a real person today yes sir
[1:44:01] oh my he already has his glorified body
[1:44:03] he resurrected that same body in a
[1:44:05] glorified condition
[1:44:06] but you bypass the theophany and become
[1:44:08] flesh man to be tempted by sin he said
[1:44:10] and then if this earthly tabernacle is
[1:44:12] dissolved we have one already waiting we
[1:44:14] have not yet the bodies but look when
[1:44:16] this body receives the spirit of god
[1:44:19] that's what quickens at church that's
[1:44:21] what we can't do without
[1:44:23] when this body receives the spirit of
[1:44:25] god the immortal life inside of you it
[1:44:27] throws this body in subjection to god
[1:44:30] hallelujah he that's born of god does
[1:44:33] not commit sin he cannot sin in romans 8
[1:44:35] and 1 there is therefore now no
[1:44:37] condemnation to them that are in christ
[1:44:38] jesus they walk not after the flesh but
[1:44:40] after the spirit there you are see that
[1:44:42] throws your body subject you don't have
[1:44:44] to say oh if i could just quit drinking
[1:44:46] if i cou he said just get in christ
[1:44:48] it's all gone see because your body is
[1:44:50] subject to the spirit it's it's not some
[1:44:52] kind of psychology
[1:44:54] it's the seed being awakened by the
[1:44:55] spirit
[1:44:56] it's the only way the seed can be
[1:44:58] awakened
[1:44:59] is by the spirit of the word watch it's
[1:45:02] no more subject to the things of the
[1:45:03] world they're dead
[1:45:05] they're dead your sins are buried in
[1:45:06] baptism
[1:45:07] you are a new creation in christ
[1:45:09] your body becoming subject to the spirit
[1:45:11] try to live a right kind of life
[1:45:13] he said like you women claiming you've
[1:45:14] got the holy ghost and going out here
[1:45:15] and wearing shorts and things how could
[1:45:17] you do it
[1:45:18] how could the spirit of god in you ever
[1:45:19] let you do such a thing as that it just
[1:45:22] can't be so
[1:45:23] certainly it can't be it's not a filthy
[1:45:25] spirit he's a holy spirit
[1:45:28] i know that maybe some of the folks in
[1:45:29] egypt are watching some of those that
[1:45:31] understand english or can translate and
[1:45:33] i want you to understand this morning
[1:45:35] that you can't have the holy spirit and
[1:45:37] go against the word
[1:45:39] because he is the spirit of the word
[1:45:43] oh my he is the spirit of the lord and
[1:45:45] that's something we had to deal with
[1:45:46] while we were there because the people
[1:45:47] were baptized as babies into the church
[1:45:49] and they felt that the filth the holy
[1:45:51] spirit on their emotions they felt a
[1:45:53] real holy spirit and i explained to one
[1:45:56] sister i said yes that that's what you
[1:45:58] feel that's real
[1:45:59] yeah but it doesn't mean you've been
[1:46:00] sealed away there's more for you there's
[1:46:03] some there's a time you can come to in
[1:46:05] the holy spirit the token seals your
[1:46:07] life
[1:46:08] yes you felt the holy spirit in
[1:46:10] justification and sanctification but now
[1:46:12] he wants to fill you with his holy
[1:46:14] spirit
[1:46:15] amen he wants to wake up that seed
[1:46:18] he wants to make it lit come live in you
[1:46:21] now watch it throws your whole being
[1:46:23] subject to the spirit and that spirit is
[1:46:25] nothing in the world
[1:46:27] what is the spirit am i boring you this
[1:46:29] morning
[1:46:30] i hope not
[1:46:31] i'll quit before i bore people
[1:46:36] i'm getting close aren't i
[1:46:39] that spirit what is the spirit of god
[1:46:41] i'm just teaching this morning so you
[1:46:43] just hang with me but brother and i said
[1:46:45] i'm gonna have a sunday school lesson
[1:46:46] three hours later you know
[1:46:50] he said the spirit is nothing in the
[1:46:51] world but this seed word made manifester
[1:46:53] quickened
[1:46:55] the spirit is
[1:46:56] you can't separate them well i'm gonna
[1:46:58] have the word not the spirit you can't
[1:47:00] do it right it's true if you get the
[1:47:02] real word you'll have the spirit that's
[1:47:03] right you can't separate those two that
[1:47:06] spirit is nothing in the world but this
[1:47:07] seed word made manifest or quick and
[1:47:09] made alive
[1:47:11] oh my
[1:47:12] oh my and when the bible said don't do
[1:47:14] this that body quickly turns to it
[1:47:17] there is no question
[1:47:19] what is it it's the earnest of the
[1:47:21] resurrection this body will be raised up
[1:47:23] again because
[1:47:25] oh god it's already started
[1:47:30] glory
[1:47:32] it was once subject to sin a mire and
[1:47:34] corruption but now it's got the earnest
[1:47:36] it's turned heavenly now that's the
[1:47:38] earnest that you're going in the rapture
[1:47:41] glory what do you tell that man said i
[1:47:43] went down here and they told me the
[1:47:44] child went down here and they told me to
[1:47:45] speak in tongues he said but one day you
[1:47:46] were walking this way one day you turned
[1:47:48] around began walking this way he said
[1:47:50] you've already got it what is it that
[1:47:51] thing that made you turn
[1:47:53] what made you turn you got the earnest
[1:47:56] it turned heavenly
[1:47:58] hey man keep feeding that keep building
[1:48:00] that amen
[1:48:01] keep believing that
[1:48:04] hallelujah
[1:48:06] hey man i'm going to skip past
[1:48:07] ephesians 2. you can go read that later
[1:48:10] ephesians 2 1-7
[1:48:12] oh my
[1:48:14] he's raised us up together he's
[1:48:15] quickened us
[1:48:17] now brother branham tells this eagle
[1:48:18] story
[1:48:20] y'all remember the eagle story
[1:48:23] maybe the kids don't don't haven't heard
[1:48:25] it but
[1:48:26] it's a story where he tells about a
[1:48:28] farmer that took a an eagle
[1:48:30] an egg from an eagle's nest
[1:48:32] from my mama eagle we had to do that
[1:48:34] when the mama was gone didn't he
[1:48:36] she was going to get some food and he
[1:48:38] come in and stole the nest stole the egg
[1:48:41] he comes in and while the egg's still
[1:48:43] warm he puts it under a chicken
[1:48:45] and under that atmosphere
[1:48:47] it hatches
[1:48:49] now the eagle is an odd eagle
[1:48:52] let's say oh duck but that's not don't
[1:48:54] fit
[1:48:56] he's an odd bird
[1:48:58] because he's bigger than the rest of
[1:49:00] them
[1:49:01] he probably trips and falls more than
[1:49:04] they do because they're little
[1:49:05] denominational chickens you know they're
[1:49:07] able to just go and fill this committee
[1:49:09] and do this and
[1:49:10] you know
[1:49:12] they just they just love it you know
[1:49:14] they're doing their little works that's
[1:49:15] what they were born to do
[1:49:17] nothing wrong with that let them do
[1:49:18] their works but this one was an eagle
[1:49:22] he wasn't born to run around scratch
[1:49:23] around the barnyard
[1:49:26] he wasn't born to go around joining this
[1:49:27] committee in that committee he was born
[1:49:29] to worship the lord designed of the
[1:49:31] heavenlies he was born to receive the
[1:49:33] word of the hour
[1:49:35] and so he's there and he begins to grow
[1:49:37] and he's just eating food with the rest
[1:49:38] of them he don't know no different
[1:49:41] but one day
[1:49:42] mama eagle knows she had another egg
[1:49:45] because she counted every one of them
[1:49:47] and she knew that she left them
[1:49:49] somewhere
[1:49:51] and so she begins to fly over the
[1:49:52] barnyard and she begins to scream
[1:49:55] because she knows that faith comes by
[1:49:57] hearing
[1:49:59] and if her little eagle is anywhere
[1:50:00] there on the ground
[1:50:02] or behind he may have been born he may
[1:50:04] be there as an eagle but he don't know
[1:50:05] he's an eagle but as soon as he hears
[1:50:08] the scream
[1:50:09] faith comes to him yes and he begins to
[1:50:12] realize that's me
[1:50:14] right amen
[1:50:17] i've heard from something i i i
[1:50:19] recognize something now listen the
[1:50:21] little eagle maybe it's too young to
[1:50:22] scream like that he's never heard
[1:50:24] anybody scream like that he doesn't know
[1:50:27] anything about that he he can't do it
[1:50:28] himself but the potentials are in him to
[1:50:31] do it
[1:50:33] hallelujah and so he because he has
[1:50:35] those potentials he recognizes a scream
[1:50:39] that he's never screamed
[1:50:41] but yet he recognizes that something
[1:50:42] more
[1:50:44] i'm different yes
[1:50:46] oh my
[1:50:47] oh my she
[1:50:48] screams she comes over he says mama what
[1:50:52] shall i do
[1:50:56] she said just jump up on that fence post
[1:50:58] boy you need to get in the meeting and
[1:50:59] hear the word of god
[1:51:01] you need to get in church you may not be
[1:51:02] flying yet but you just need to sit
[1:51:04] under the word for a while listen to the
[1:51:06] scream jump up on the post get the faith
[1:51:08] together then begin to flap your wings
[1:51:10] you begin to exercise your faith you
[1:51:11] begin to get rid of all the things of
[1:51:13] the world and begin to begin to walk
[1:51:15] with god begin to exercise after a while
[1:51:17] the same wings that are carrying her is
[1:51:19] going to carry you
[1:51:21] all right why because you were an eagle
[1:51:22] to begin with
[1:51:24] brother brown said his grandpa and
[1:51:25] grandma were eagles he was the eagle all
[1:51:28] the way back
[1:51:29] eagle don't mix with other things
[1:51:31] he's not a hybrid at all he's an eagle
[1:51:33] then after you recognize the very word
[1:51:35] of god with eagle food you left the
[1:51:37] other thing you have been been formed
[1:51:40] into the living image of the living god
[1:51:42] listen you heard from your
[1:51:45] theophany
[1:51:47] hallelujah
[1:51:48] i recognize that
[1:51:51] you've made contact by faith
[1:51:53] with your heavenly home
[1:51:55] yes listen we don't ignore our senses
[1:51:57] that would be foolish right
[1:51:59] all right
[1:52:00] it'll be foolish if you could ignore
[1:52:01] your senses you you get burned
[1:52:04] you get hurt
[1:52:06] you don't ignore your senses god gave
[1:52:07] those to you but if they're against the
[1:52:09] word you ignore them
[1:52:13] he said
[1:52:15] he said if you're in christ now listen
[1:52:17] we don't reject emotion we only reject
[1:52:19] that emotion which produces a life
[1:52:21] contrary to the word
[1:52:23] if you're in christ there's not a word
[1:52:25] written in here he said but what you
[1:52:26] believe it
[1:52:28] i don't care what anybody else said
[1:52:29] right and then god makes that thing
[1:52:31] manifested
[1:52:33] he said because when he pours the spirit
[1:52:34] upon the word what happens just like
[1:52:36] putting water on any other seed it'll
[1:52:37] live it'll bring forth of its kind when
[1:52:39] he pours the spirit it'll bring forth of
[1:52:41] its kind don't you feed the spirit in a
[1:52:43] meeting
[1:52:44] oh god i wish i could explain this to
[1:52:46] you the spirit in a prayer line will
[1:52:48] bring
[1:52:49] seeds good seed out of where that good
[1:52:51] seed is
[1:52:54] it'll bring bad seed
[1:52:56] out of where the bat the same spirit
[1:52:59] will will also make the tares grow
[1:53:02] he said brother ben we don't want tears
[1:53:05] let's stop the rain go look and see how
[1:53:06] that's working for the farmers
[1:53:11] they want rain
[1:53:12] everyone texts me this morning we need
[1:53:14] the rain
[1:53:15] we need the rain oh oh church if we
[1:53:17] could only recognize i'm i'm going to
[1:53:19] close i'm just going to stop and close
[1:53:20] but if you only could recognize we need
[1:53:23] the rain
[1:53:25] we need the rain
[1:53:27] oh my we need it
[1:53:29] you say i got the baptism the holy ghost
[1:53:31] he says that i don't mean you're saved
[1:53:32] not by the long ways see because it's
[1:53:33] what the rain falls on you're a trying
[1:53:35] being he explains that you got five
[1:53:37] senses go to the next quote and you've
[1:53:39] got five senses
[1:53:41] he said
[1:53:42] he said they don't contact the rest of
[1:53:43] it you've got five senses of the spirit
[1:53:45] he said but in here is where you live
[1:53:46] that's what you are didn't jesus say the
[1:53:49] rain falls on the just and the unjust
[1:53:50] put a cocker bear out here and wheat out
[1:53:52] there pour water on them keep them under
[1:53:54] fertilized and things like that won't
[1:53:55] they both live by the same water
[1:53:58] sure well what is it one of them will
[1:53:59] bear kuckleberg because that's all he is
[1:54:02] don't get discouraged by that church
[1:54:04] don't get discouraged by those who don't
[1:54:06] live it don't get discouraged by those
[1:54:08] who have emotions but never for
[1:54:10] have a christian life but be encouraged
[1:54:12] by the power of god working in your life
[1:54:16] what is it he said one of them will bear
[1:54:18] a coca bread that's all he is the
[1:54:19] cluckleberry will raise his hands and
[1:54:20] shout just the same as the wheat
[1:54:23] but if you have no grip no rain
[1:54:26] you have no growth
[1:54:30] not of the cockaburr and not of the weed
[1:54:35] you talk you talked about having an
[1:54:36] anointing calf has had an anointing
[1:54:37] balaam had an anointing i don't have
[1:54:39] anything to do with the inside
[1:54:40] he said unless that was god's seed is
[1:54:42] gene from the beginning you're finished
[1:54:44] i don't care how much you shout speak
[1:54:45] with tongues and run has nothing to do
[1:54:47] with it cocober can count just as much
[1:54:48] as any of the rest of them
[1:54:50] i've seen heathens raise and shout
[1:54:51] speaking tongues drink blood out of a
[1:54:53] human skull he said so you don't any of
[1:54:54] them sensations and things forget it
[1:54:56] it's your heart in that word yes oh god
[1:55:00] that's christ
[1:55:01] bring in there watch it make itself
[1:55:02] known just as it opens up like any other
[1:55:05] seed and declares itself
[1:55:07] laodicea
[1:55:09] i'm here
[1:55:11] amen it declares itself for the age it's
[1:55:14] living in
[1:55:16] amen
[1:55:17] brother brad was teaching this as he
[1:55:18] goes down to the end of his ministry as
[1:55:19] i'm coming down at the end of this
[1:55:21] sermon musicians go ahead and come
[1:55:23] should say musician go ahead and come
[1:55:29] you can have the baptism of the holy
[1:55:30] ghost every hour in your life and still
[1:55:32] be lost and go to hell
[1:55:34] what's he driving home
[1:55:36] it's not the rain that makes you what
[1:55:38] you are
[1:55:39] you're a seed of god
[1:55:42] whether you feel the rain or not you're
[1:55:44] a seed of god oh i hope that sinks down
[1:55:47] deep in your heart
[1:55:49] he said look here you're an outside
[1:55:50] person you have five senses contact your
[1:55:52] body that god gave you not to contact
[1:55:55] him
[1:55:55] your earthly home
[1:55:57] you have a spirit on the inside of it it
[1:55:58] has five outlets you contact the spirit
[1:56:00] world you said your physical context is
[1:56:02] physical your spiritual context is
[1:56:04] spiritual but inside of that you've got
[1:56:05] a soul and that soul is that gene that
[1:56:07] comes from god
[1:56:08] like a baby formed in his mother's womb
[1:56:10] when the baby comes into the mother's
[1:56:11] womb by the little germ it crawls into
[1:56:13] the egg it doesn't form one cell a human
[1:56:15] the next the dog the next cat and the
[1:56:17] next the horse it's all human cells
[1:56:19] because it's building off of an original
[1:56:20] human cell and when a man has been born
[1:56:22] again by the word of god predestinated
[1:56:24] to eternal life called the elected it'll
[1:56:27] be word of god on top of word amen let
[1:56:29] me believe that this morning
[1:56:31] amen the word preached did not profit
[1:56:34] many in the old testament why because it
[1:56:35] was not mixed with faith
[1:56:38] listen only the thought of god in you
[1:56:40] can respond to the thought of god
[1:56:42] expressed in the word
[1:56:44] you ever thought about that
[1:56:46] it's the thought of god in you that
[1:56:47] responds to the thought of god expressed
[1:56:49] in the word
[1:56:50] listen bethlehem was full of people go
[1:56:52] ahead and start playing something
[1:56:54] i got more notes but we're gonna quit
[1:56:58] bethlehem was full of people when jesus
[1:57:00] was born
[1:57:02] full of people tax collectors
[1:57:05] jews gentiles romans
[1:57:08] all kinds
[1:57:10] an innkeeper
[1:57:11] was there who actually physically saw
[1:57:14] them
[1:57:15] there may have been others there may
[1:57:17] have been many
[1:57:18] they were
[1:57:19] stable which was probably a cave like on
[1:57:20] the hillside there may have been people
[1:57:22] who heard god
[1:57:24] cry
[1:57:26] think about it for the first time in
[1:57:28] human flesh they heard god in human
[1:57:31] flesh cry
[1:57:32] say god can't do that you underestimate
[1:57:35] god
[1:57:38] they heard jehovah crying in the manger
[1:57:42] all right oh god
[1:57:44] they said it ain't him
[1:57:46] it ain't him
[1:57:49] they didn't think nothing about it
[1:57:52] how does god reveal himself to you now
[1:57:54] look
[1:57:56] he has to reach us by our five senses
[1:57:58] sometimes that's why it's so important
[1:57:59] that we entertain him what brother
[1:58:01] wendell said on sunday morning
[1:58:03] why do we come early to church
[1:58:05] why do we set a certain atmosphere in
[1:58:07] the services why do we want the spirit
[1:58:09] of god always moving in our midst we
[1:58:10] don't want nothing to hinder that and i
[1:58:12] appreciate you all for for keeping that
[1:58:14] atmosphere right i appreciate it so much
[1:58:16] we have deacons and things and and
[1:58:18] people and trustees in the church just
[1:58:20] to keep that burden off of me to where
[1:58:22] where i can think about heavenly things
[1:58:24] most of the time and i'm so thankful for
[1:58:27] that why do we work so hard for that
[1:58:30] because we want to entertain him when he
[1:58:32] comes
[1:58:33] we want to we'll make him feel welcome
[1:58:35] when he's here his brother window
[1:58:36] preached sunday morning
[1:58:38] now they did not entertain him the
[1:58:39] innkeeper didn't entertain him
[1:58:42] the other people in the city didn't
[1:58:43] entertain him
[1:58:45] but there were some shepherds on a
[1:58:46] hillside
[1:58:48] amen they kept their flocks by night the
[1:58:51] lowliest of the low oh that gives me
[1:58:53] hope today
[1:58:55] the lowliest of the law were on the
[1:58:56] hillside
[1:58:58] but they had been foreordained by
[1:59:00] god
[1:59:02] to
[1:59:03] to come and worship
[1:59:05] at the feet of jesus
[1:59:07] now think about it
[1:59:09] they were predestined to do that how was
[1:59:11] he going to reach them
[1:59:13] so if they were the word they'd just
[1:59:15] know that's not how he did it
[1:59:18] think about it
[1:59:19] he sent messengers
[1:59:22] and a light shone round about them have
[1:59:24] you never heard the christmas story
[1:59:26] think about it
[1:59:27] light shone around about them they were
[1:59:30] in the fields and he used sight
[1:59:33] he used sound the angel singing
[1:59:38] they heard the words that they were
[1:59:39] singing and they heard the commandment
[1:59:41] of the angel
[1:59:42] what did he do he used the five senses
[1:59:46] don't reject that if it comes from god
[1:59:49] but the word was inside of him he said
[1:59:51] brother ben how will i know if it's the
[1:59:52] truth because the word is inside of you
[1:59:56] the word is not just on printed page the
[1:59:58] word is inside of you the thoughts of
[2:00:00] god this has been translated you say oh
[2:00:03] but i can't trust it because it's been
[2:00:04] translated why can you trust it because
[2:00:06] the word is not just here
[2:00:08] the word is here
[2:00:12] they knew it was true not because they
[2:00:14] were the greatest students in the land
[2:00:18] and they said glory to god in the
[2:00:19] highest
[2:00:20] and the angels come and they felt they
[2:00:22] had a wonderful meeting
[2:00:23] they said that's god he's fulfilling his
[2:00:27] word
[2:00:28] let's take the journey down to bethlehem
[2:00:31] let's go down into town
[2:00:33] we don't care what people think about us
[2:00:35] we want to entertain him
[2:00:37] we want to make him feel welcome
[2:00:39] brother brandon said a man that believes
[2:00:40] in god can see the presence of god
[2:00:43] feel the presence of god over brother
[2:00:46] branham those are five senses a man that
[2:00:48] believes that sick sins has been
[2:00:50] activated
[2:00:51] can see the presence of god feel the
[2:00:52] presence of god sense the presence of
[2:00:54] god and no he's here he is here do you
[2:00:56] believe that this morning to answer
[2:00:59] everything that he made promise for in
[2:01:00] this day then cry till you get it yes
[2:01:04] don't give up church
[2:01:06] i see some
[2:01:08] i watch people in services and they'll
[2:01:11] sip in
[2:01:12] and then you lose them
[2:01:14] and they slip in and then you lose them
[2:01:16] and sometimes you get to a part that
[2:01:18] they really need
[2:01:19] and as a pastor
[2:01:21] and your your senses are heightened when
[2:01:23] you preach i can't explain that but it
[2:01:24] just is you tighten and you begin to
[2:01:26] watch people sip in and they slip out
[2:01:28] and you watch that sometimes because we
[2:01:29] preach too long
[2:01:31] but when that happens you watch that and
[2:01:34] i think satan's trying to keep you
[2:01:35] you're bringing that tired spirit
[2:01:36] through your senses
[2:01:38] maybe there's kids interrupting you not
[2:01:40] meeting this morning
[2:01:41] but maybe at home
[2:01:43] satan's using them five cents much
[2:01:45] harder to stream than it is to come to
[2:01:46] church
[2:01:47] because when you're streaming it's
[2:01:49] harder to get anything out of it because
[2:01:50] you've got all these other distractions
[2:01:53] and you're sitting there on facebook
[2:01:54] right now listening to me but not
[2:01:55] watching typing something
[2:01:58] huh
[2:02:00] you about it man i can't believe he knew
[2:02:02] that well it's just the way we are
[2:02:06] human senses
[2:02:08] oh god but if you just activate that
[2:02:10] faith
[2:02:12] stay with it cry until you get it
[2:02:15] don't stop at a meeting don't say well
[2:02:17] we had our good meeting that does it for
[2:02:19] the year let's just over go on vacation
[2:02:21] now and and it's wonderful you can go on
[2:02:22] vacation i go on vacation everybody does
[2:02:24] but listen we got to keep working we got
[2:02:26] to keep moving we got to keep our
[2:02:28] shoulders to the wheel keep our swords
[2:02:30] in the battle
[2:02:31] while we're being shot at we might as
[2:02:32] well shoot back
[2:02:35] the devil's firing his fiery darts you
[2:02:38] might as well take the word the sword of
[2:02:40] the spirit and fight back against him
[2:02:44] amen do you believe it today
[2:02:49] brother branham told the story about the
[2:02:51] little boy
[2:02:53] he said
[2:02:55] a little boy asked his mother said can a
[2:02:57] man see god
[2:02:59] he said i don't know go ask your pastor
[2:03:02] he goes ask the pastor or the sunday
[2:03:04] school teacher first he went to her did
[2:03:06] a man see god
[2:03:07] he said i don't know ask the pastor
[2:03:10] can a man see god the pastor began to
[2:03:12] explain it in some intellectual way
[2:03:14] the little boy just wasn't satisfied
[2:03:16] one morning he went fishing early in the
[2:03:18] morning probably as early as we did the
[2:03:20] other morning brother isaac went fishing
[2:03:23] went out early in the morning
[2:03:25] they got out just out by the
[2:03:26] by the ocean where they were fishing
[2:03:28] right by the edge of it and they watched
[2:03:30] the sun begin to come up
[2:03:32] and tears began to stream down the old
[2:03:34] fisherman's face
[2:03:36] and a little boy just was moved to ask
[2:03:37] the question again he said can a man see
[2:03:40] god
[2:03:43] he said for 70 years all i've seen is
[2:03:45] god
[2:03:48] why his five senses were tuned
[2:03:51] to the sixth sense
[2:03:54] oh god
[2:03:55] i wish i had time to explain it today
[2:03:56] but i believe you get it i believe
[2:03:58] you're the word
[2:03:59] you can receive the word
[2:04:01] entertain his presence recognize him
[2:04:03] when he shows himself
[2:04:04] tune your five senses to be able to see
[2:04:06] and to hear and to feel and to smell and
[2:04:08] to taste
