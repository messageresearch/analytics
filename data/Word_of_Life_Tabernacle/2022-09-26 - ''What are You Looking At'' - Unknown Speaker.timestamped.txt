[42:25] you've given us the word that we heard
[42:27] this morning we want to thank you Lord
[42:29] Lord but we believe if I can move myself
[42:31] out of the way and let you speak to the
[42:33] people tonight I pray Lord it will just
[42:35] be a blessing to him
[42:37] Lord if there's a sick one Among Us I
[42:39] pray you would walk down the aisle and
[42:40] touch each one right now we ask Heavenly
[42:43] Father Lord as you come down to earth
[42:45] Lord just to
[42:47] Lord just to give your your son to us
[42:49] and the gift of Life To Us Lord I pray
[42:51] that the word would be quick and made
[42:53] alive this afternoon through him this
[42:54] this day Lord and we just pray you'll be
[42:56] with us now each one that has come out
[42:58] Lord I pray he would give him a special
[42:59] blessing we pray in Jesus name
[43:02] amen are you happy to be in the house of
[43:04] the Lord this afternoon
[43:07] you would get your Bibles and turn to
[43:10] Hebrews chapter 12.
[43:16] did you enjoy that sermon this morning
[43:19] it's hard to follow up after that I I'm
[43:22] really really loud I can hear myself
[43:26] I feel like people back are covering
[43:27] their ears
[43:32] Hebrews chapter 12 and verse 1.
[43:34] wherefore seeing we also are compassed
[43:36] about with so great a cloud of witnesses
[43:39] let us lay aside every weight and the
[43:42] sin which doth so easily easily beset us
[43:45] and let us run with patience the race
[43:47] that is set before us looking unto Jesus
[43:50] the author and the finisher of our faith
[43:53] who for the joy that was set before him
[43:56] endured the cross despising the shame
[43:58] and is set down at the right hand of the
[44:01] Throne of God and if you would turn to
[44:03] John chapter 4
[44:05] and verse 25
[44:07] very familiar scripture here the woman
[44:10] saith unto him I know that messiah's
[44:12] cometh which is called Christ when he
[44:15] has come he will tell us all things
[44:17] Jesus saith unto her I that speak unto
[44:20] thee am he and upon this came his
[44:22] disciples and marveled that he talked
[44:24] with the woman yet no man said what
[44:26] seeketh thou or why talk us thou with
[44:28] her the woman then left her water pot
[44:30] and went her way into the City and saith
[44:32] to the men come see a man which told me
[44:34] all the things that ever I did is this
[44:38] not the Christ
[44:40] you may be seated may the Lord add His
[44:42] blessings to the reading of the word
[44:45] I would like to make this point today to
[44:46] you that she got what she was looking
[44:48] for
[44:49] this woman thank you brother David this
[44:52] woman here
[44:53] had to have known something in the
[44:55] scriptures
[44:57] in order to know that when this thing
[44:58] happened that the Messiah was there
[45:01] and I think today in order to get
[45:03] anything from God you have to look for
[45:05] something from God there's a people on
[45:08] Earth today I believe that are looking
[45:09] for a Rapture so there is a Rapture to
[45:11] happen but in order for that to happen
[45:13] there has to be someone here looking for
[45:16] that to happen
[45:17] and in this age of distractions and
[45:20] things that are always going on and
[45:21] clouding our minds and and there's
[45:23] always look at me and there's a
[45:25] billboard here and and there's something
[45:27] on the TV over here and there's so many
[45:29] things to distract us and wanting us to
[45:31] look at it I wonder if today if we could
[45:33] ever get focused back on Christ and we
[45:36] would see Christ then the word would be
[45:38] made made plain to us again and brother
[45:41] Branham says it like this
[45:43] he says the Bible said in Isaiah 45 22
[45:46] he said we find that God said look unto
[45:47] me all the ends of the Earth and now
[45:49] when the Earth has come to its end or
[45:50] the system of the Earth has come to its
[45:52] end let the people look unto him he said
[45:54] now you might say we have heard this
[45:56] generation after generation we've heard
[45:58] this for a long time that is true he
[46:00] said it's been preached for a long time
[46:02] many ministers has took the same text he
[46:04] said thousands of them but here is the
[46:07] thing I want to ask you tonight for the
[46:08] next few minutes he said when you look
[46:10] the question is what do you see when you
[46:14] look what do you see when you do look
[46:16] that only depends on what you're looking
[46:18] for and if you're looking for a Revival
[46:20] in the church I believe you'll get a
[46:22] Revival from the church but if you're
[46:24] going to church and you're looking for
[46:25] some just just regular sermon or you're
[46:27] just looking for another another you
[46:30] know check the box and say well I went
[46:31] to church Sunday well that's good but
[46:33] but that's not all you should go looking
[46:35] and expecting something to happen he
[46:37] said now he said now look unto me all
[46:39] the ends of the Earth Moses lifted the
[46:41] serpent up the brass serpent he said the
[46:43] people looked and he said if you ever
[46:46] and ever he said and ever who looked got
[46:48] healed he said now it depends on what
[46:51] you're looking for and he and he goes on
[46:53] he said I still believe God he said I
[46:55] focused in on the word and now and know
[46:57] that truth nobody has ever been able to
[46:59] shake me from that he said as long as
[47:01] god holds my heart straight on that word
[47:03] I'll stay there he said Elijah one day
[47:06] when he was looking for something to
[47:07] come to bring the people to the to the
[47:09] to bring help to the people excuse me he
[47:11] said he looked and he looked to the old
[47:14] man 80 something years old was too tired
[47:15] to climb the mountain and been fasting
[47:17] and praying but God told him if they
[47:19] would repent something would happen what
[47:21] was he looking for he sent his servant
[47:23] up and said go up and look something's
[47:25] going to happen three and a half years
[47:27] and no rain he said not a cloud not even
[47:28] Dew Fallen but he said go look see he
[47:31] was expecting the rain to come
[47:33] go look there is coming rain
[47:36] but you've got to look for it
[47:38] and he said and Elijah goes back he said
[47:40] I mean geeza goes back and he looks and
[47:42] and looks and Elijah that little bald
[47:44] head sitting there in the Sun and his
[47:46] whiskers and his beard white beard and
[47:47] them little bony looking arms across his
[47:49] bony knees and he said Lord God he said
[47:52] he began to pray he said go back again
[47:53] now he said what was he doing he was
[47:56] looking for God to take care of his
[47:58] promise no matter how brassy the skies
[48:01] looked how much judgment is upon it
[48:03] you're looking for the promise of God so
[48:06] whatever you're looking for today is
[48:08] what you're going to receive today if
[48:10] you go into church and you're looking
[48:11] for the problems in the church you're
[48:12] going to find the problems in the church
[48:14] if you're looking to be blessed by God I
[48:16] believe you'll get a blessing from God
[48:18] and I think that's the problem as we go
[48:20] there and we're not looking for the
[48:22] right thing we're looking to see maybe
[48:23] who's dressed up and how and and we're
[48:26] looking over here to see who's there and
[48:27] who's not there but the thing of it is
[48:29] let's look to Christ in the word and
[48:31] there will be something revealed to you
[48:34] he said it depends on what you're
[48:35] looking for he said remember you can
[48:37] only see him as you look at him through
[48:39] the word and I I read that and it come
[48:42] to me a lot of times we look at the
[48:45] message and we're looking at it through
[48:46] uh through the lens of an idea or a
[48:48] preconceived notion of something we've
[48:51] heard maybe from our parents or our
[48:52] grandparents and and something that
[48:54] would be told well this has got to
[48:55] happen or this has got this got to take
[48:57] place before the coming of the Lord but
[48:59] what it is we're getting off track and
[49:01] we're looking at things to happen in the
[49:02] future but really the only thing we
[49:04] should be looking for is the coming of
[49:06] the Lord and he said he said remember
[49:08] you can only see him if you look through
[49:10] the lens of the word and I wonder if we
[49:12] could get back and look through look at
[49:15] the message through the Bible
[49:17] and it'll look different to you and I
[49:20] believe that with all my heart I think
[49:22] we looked way too often we look at the
[49:24] message as through a story or something
[49:26] and those are good things but let's not
[49:28] look through a story and say well the
[49:30] message must it must have to happen like
[49:32] this and then you have to throw out a
[49:34] quote here and you have to throw out a
[49:35] scripture over here to make your little
[49:37] idea work and it just makes you a
[49:39] miserable Christian I remember at one
[49:41] time I had struggled about the the the
[49:43] I'll just tell you the return of brother
[49:45] Branham people was always tell me it's
[49:47] got to happen it's got to happen but let
[49:48] me tell you something quit looking for a
[49:50] man to come back and look to the word
[49:53] we're looking for something to take
[49:55] place that's not going to happen
[49:57] and if it did happen it wouldn't really
[49:59] have that much significance because it's
[50:00] not in the word but let me just tell you
[50:02] like this what we need to be looking for
[50:04] is a Biblical promise of a Rapture a
[50:07] Biblical promise of the spirit of the
[50:09] Lord fallen in the last days something
[50:11] that will take place and you can stand
[50:13] your stand your steak put your stake on
[50:16] it the word of God says it will happen
[50:17] it will happen so when Elijah when they
[50:20] were looking for something looking for
[50:22] the rain to come remember all it was was
[50:24] just a cloud the size of a man's hand
[50:27] but that was the beginning of the
[50:29] promise being fulfilled and when you see
[50:31] the Pentecostal age they got to see they
[50:33] got to see the the first pull come forth
[50:35] and and they got to see the healings and
[50:37] and the Revival that swept the land and
[50:39] and that was good and they accepted that
[50:41] but then when the word come forth but
[50:43] that's what we're looking for was the
[50:46] revealing of the Seven Seals in our day
[50:48] we weren't looking for just the gift but
[50:51] that got your attention and then we were
[50:53] able to see what the full promise was
[50:55] for the day he said I will pour out my
[50:57] spirit sure he did but then he said in
[50:59] the days of the voice of the seventh
[51:01] angel when he shall begin to sound the
[51:03] mystery of God would be finished now we
[51:05] can look back and say we see it because
[51:08] we were looking for it
[51:10] if you wasn't looking for the coming of
[51:12] a messenger in this day then you
[51:13] probably haven't found him and if he
[51:16] wasn't looking for for for Noah's
[51:18] message in his day then I'm sure you
[51:20] probably never got on the boat but if
[51:22] you were standing there and you heard
[51:23] the word of God for that day and you
[51:26] recognized the word of the hour then you
[51:28] would get on that boat with Noah
[51:30] right if you were going to follow Moses
[51:33] out into the desert it may not have
[51:35] looked very good but if you were going
[51:36] to follow a man and you didn't know
[51:38] where you were going you knew where the
[51:39] end Journey was but you didn't know what
[51:41] laid between here and there you had to
[51:43] have some faith in that man
[51:45] and the message that he brought to you
[51:47] but you had to be looking for a
[51:49] deliverer or you would never accept him
[51:51] when he came and I think that's the
[51:54] problem today is we're not looking for
[51:56] the word of God to take us in a Rapture
[51:58] but what we're looking for is the
[52:01] problems in the church or I just want to
[52:02] be a church member and I will take my
[52:05] kids to church we heard this morning
[52:06] that's not good enough that'll just make
[52:08] you a miserable Christian but what we
[52:10] want to do is follow every word
[52:13] and when you're looking at the word when
[52:16] you look to the Bible and you look to
[52:17] the message of the hour remember if
[52:19] you'll look at it through the eyes of
[52:21] the word you'll see Christ
[52:24] we've heard recently that Christ is
[52:27] revealed in every chapter of the Bible
[52:30] and that's the truth do you believe it
[52:32] and sometimes and and if you look at it
[52:34] and you're looking at it through the
[52:37] entirety of the Bible and you take the
[52:39] message you start seeing things revealed
[52:40] and and you see things that are opening
[52:43] to you that you've never seen before
[52:44] it's amazing what it'll do to you it'll
[52:47] stimulate You by that Revelation it'll
[52:50] make an alive person out of a dead
[52:51] church member
[52:53] it'll make you act different it'll
[52:55] change your whole outlook on the life as
[52:57] well look when you see Christ as he is
[53:00] but that's what the woman at the well is
[53:02] looking for she was looking for a coming
[53:05] Messiah
[53:07] and maybe she wasn't actively searching
[53:10] but when he came by and he sat down and
[53:12] he told her the things that she did
[53:15] you must be him why because she was
[53:18] looking for him and so when you see the
[53:21] message being revealed in this day
[53:23] that must be Revelations 10 7. that must
[53:27] be Malachi 4 because you're looking for
[53:30] it God promised to send it to you and
[53:33] it's here this day the scripture is
[53:35] fulfilled before your eyes
[53:37] brother Brandon goes on down he said he
[53:39] said Daniel one time was standing when
[53:41] he saw the ending of the Gentile
[53:42] kingdoms he saw the image that
[53:44] Nebuchadnezzar had dreamed and he saw
[53:45] how each one would each would succeed
[53:48] the other and as they come down and when
[53:49] he looked to see what was all going to
[53:51] happen at the end he saw Jesus he was
[53:53] the stone hewed out of the mountain
[53:55] without hands
[53:56] he saw something because he was looking
[53:58] search the scriptures and you'll find
[54:01] here he said he said when brother
[54:03] Branham goes on he says when he throwed
[54:05] the three Hebrew children in the fiery
[54:07] furnace he said they believed in God and
[54:08] stood on his word is that you today do
[54:12] you believe in God do you stand on his
[54:13] word the entirety of the word not just
[54:16] something you think or something you
[54:18] hope happens but something that the
[54:19] prophet said and the prophet revealed
[54:21] and opened to you the scriptures and so
[54:23] now we can say that we are true Bible
[54:25] Believers because we can see what it
[54:27] said
[54:28] he said and he said he said what it was
[54:31] he said if they had to die for it they
[54:33] was going to stand anyhow just a little
[54:35] thing of bow on their knee or some other
[54:36] way but when he looked away and saw
[54:38] Jesus was the fourth man he said that
[54:40] was in the fiery furnace he said kept
[54:42] all the heat off of him he said his
[54:44] obedience servants that's what
[54:46] Nebuchadnezzar saw he was looking in the
[54:48] fire he was looking for him to be burned
[54:50] up but what did he see a fourth man
[54:51] walking around down there and he said he
[54:54] said another day Ezekiel and he goes on
[54:56] through these different men in the Bible
[54:57] and they what they would see when they
[54:59] would look and he said Ezekiel looked
[55:01] away to see him one day and he was a
[55:02] wheel in the middle of the wheel and way
[55:04] up in the middle of the air he was the
[55:05] Hub to the wheel and he said he said he
[55:07] goes down and and he just goes on and he
[55:10] said that's who Ezekiel Saw when he
[55:12] looked away he said the wheel was being
[55:13] turned by the power of the Lord
[55:16] he saw a wheel in the middle of the
[55:18] wheel Elijah saw a cloud the size of a
[55:20] man's hand
[55:22] no doubt Noah he didn't see the rain
[55:25] cloud but he saw a promise Abraham and
[55:28] Sarah we can just go on down through the
[55:30] scriptures they looked for the promised
[55:32] son because they knew that the word had
[55:35] to happen so when you read the word and
[55:37] it says this will happen look for it
[55:39] it's coming
[55:41] the people in the days of Noah remember
[55:42] they were called Fanatics too those
[55:44] people today you people today looking
[55:46] for a Rapture you're called Fanatics too
[55:48] people say oh the Rapture is not even a
[55:50] Biblical word oh but there's a catching
[55:51] away of the church
[55:53] that's Bible and a Prophet come and
[55:55] called it a Rapture that's good enough
[55:56] for me amen because we are going to be
[55:59] caught up the dead in Christ shall rise
[56:01] first and we who remain will be caught
[56:03] up to meet those who remain in the air
[56:04] and the children of Israel when we we
[56:07] looked at that I want to dwell on that
[56:08] for just a second of the children of
[56:09] Israel when they come down to the Red
[56:11] Sea there you know they're looking and
[56:13] they found they followed the prophet and
[56:16] they get down to the Red Sea and and all
[56:17] of a sudden they think they're following
[56:19] God they think oh what could go wrong
[56:20] and here comes pharaoh and his army and
[56:24] they look back and no doubt many of them
[56:25] were scared to death
[56:27] well and they say why you brought us out
[56:30] here just to die in the wilderness
[56:32] and and they got scared
[56:34] but there was someone there who had
[56:36] already seen the promised land to come
[56:39] and he said that's where we're going and
[56:41] the Lord told me to go
[56:44] and so he stretched out that staff over
[56:46] over the waters and it opened up and
[56:48] they saw that great miracle and what did
[56:50] they do on the other side they come out
[56:51] rejoicing
[56:52] Miriam come out plant her tambourine and
[56:55] and they were just acting like a bunch
[56:57] of Pentecostals over there because why
[56:58] they had come through a trial
[57:01] and now that they'd come out on the
[57:03] other side of the trial they were free
[57:05] and they realized that there was no Army
[57:07] going to swallow them up no more but
[57:09] then they continued on through the
[57:10] Wilderness and the next thing you know
[57:12] they they're there just a little bit
[57:13] longer than they thought
[57:14] maybe they'd been there 10 20 years at
[57:16] this point and and they got tired of
[57:18] eating uh you know the quail and the
[57:20] Mana that was coming down and oh it just
[57:23] that wasn't good enough for him and and
[57:24] you know they had already seen what God
[57:26] had done
[57:27] but it just kind of seemed like their
[57:29] eyes were getting waxed over a little
[57:31] bit and and they get on down there and
[57:32] they started complaining
[57:34] and Moses the prophet that he was was
[57:36] always standing in the gap for the
[57:38] people and and trying to you know don't
[57:40] don't curse the people God don't do that
[57:41] you know we want to have mercy on him
[57:43] and and Moses went on down and remember
[57:45] they got all the way to the promised
[57:46] land
[57:47] took him 40 years and if you look at the
[57:50] map that's not very far
[57:52] but it took him 40 years they had the
[57:55] worst guide apparently you know but uh
[57:57] but the pillar fire was guiding him but
[57:59] I guess the Lord was sitting there says
[58:00] as long as you complain we're gonna go
[58:01] in a circle
[58:02] we're just going to go in a circle I
[58:04] wonder today if we could ever get past
[58:06] our complaining enough to just step on
[58:08] into the promises of God
[58:10] but we stay here in a circle
[58:12] just going around and around thinking
[58:15] hey
[58:16] you know what listen listen there's
[58:18] nothing there's no reason to complain
[58:20] you have a promise of a Rapture you have
[58:22] a promise of being raised up even if you
[58:24] go first you might as well just take
[58:26] life as it comes I know it's easier said
[58:29] than done but listen to me Church
[58:30] there's no reason for the Christian
[58:33] to just spend their life in in confusion
[58:36] and chaos and complaining and griping
[58:38] all the time you see it happening in the
[58:40] church and you see it happening on
[58:42] Facebook and and they're just
[58:43] complaining and complaining all the time
[58:45] but listen we are to be called out from
[58:47] among those complainers and to live a
[58:49] Victorious life through Jesus Christ
[58:52] there's so many times and those those
[58:54] people remember that kept them just
[58:55] going in circles they couldn't ever go
[58:57] over and possess the land because they
[58:59] were complaining because they didn't
[59:00] have good enough food and they were
[59:01] complaining because they didn't have
[59:02] nice enough seats and they didn't have a
[59:04] good enough sound system and all these
[59:06] things they were complaining about but
[59:07] listen there was a land just a little
[59:10] just a little ways away that was flowing
[59:12] with milk and honey and grapes and all
[59:14] these things but what happened was they
[59:16] got stuck in their confusion and doubt
[59:18] and chaos
[59:21] and they get over to the land and then
[59:22] the spies go over
[59:24] and the spies that go over there and and
[59:26] and the and some of them come back with
[59:28] a bad report we can't go over what they
[59:29] see they saw giants
[59:32] well we can't take the land because
[59:33] there's Giants in our way this is the
[59:35] Promised Land by the way this is the
[59:37] land that God gave you
[59:39] and well I just can't go over but there
[59:42] were some Believers in there who were
[59:43] looking at the promise and we are more
[59:46] than able
[59:47] to take the land
[59:49] if there's a sickness battling you this
[59:52] afternoon you are more than able to
[59:54] overcome that there is a promised word
[59:56] in the Bible that tells you that by his
[59:59] stripes
[1:00:00] you were already healed
[1:00:02] you your family you think well they're
[1:00:05] all going out and and they're they're
[1:00:06] just running away and I can't keep them
[1:00:08] in church and and if you're doing all
[1:00:10] that you know to do in the home
[1:00:12] there is a promise for that child to
[1:00:14] return
[1:00:15] we heard that we need a home for him to
[1:00:17] come back to but if you've done your
[1:00:19] best and they still go out there's a
[1:00:22] promise that is unto you and to your
[1:00:24] children and to them that are far off if
[1:00:26] you believe that promise God has given
[1:00:28] you your children
[1:00:30] if you can only believe the promise but
[1:00:32] what are you looking at are you looking
[1:00:34] at the symptoms of the child or are you
[1:00:36] looking to the promise of God all that's
[1:00:38] what we have to look at is the promise
[1:00:40] always look at the promise and if we're
[1:00:42] having a bad day just remember there's a
[1:00:44] promise for you that you can overcome
[1:00:46] Temptation you can overcome all these
[1:00:48] things that come at you remember you are
[1:00:50] more than able you are more than
[1:00:52] conquerors
[1:00:53] more than conquerors
[1:00:56] Abraham had met God and
[1:00:58] all he saw was a promise
[1:01:00] and we're the children of Abraham
[1:01:02] correct
[1:01:03] we're the children of Abraham we are
[1:01:04] more than able
[1:01:07] we see that when John saw him brother
[1:01:10] Branham uses this illustration
[1:01:12] John Solomon said Behold the Lamb of God
[1:01:15] I wonder if when we see Christ
[1:01:17] if we really see who he really is
[1:01:20] or if we're just looking at him as a
[1:01:22] historical figure
[1:01:24] oh I see Jesus and and I see him in the
[1:01:26] scripture and he walked the roads and
[1:01:28] and it's just wonderful we see what he
[1:01:31] did and and the healings that took place
[1:01:32] and and we don't really know that when
[1:01:35] he went away he came back and lives
[1:01:37] among you you don't see him as that but
[1:01:39] you just see him as a historical God but
[1:01:41] today I'm here to tell you he is more
[1:01:43] than just a Jesus that walked in flesh
[1:01:45] but he's in your flesh today he's
[1:01:47] something more than just a man that
[1:01:49] walked the seashores of Galilee he's
[1:01:52] something more that put mud in a man's
[1:01:54] eyes and made him see he's someone more
[1:01:56] than even hung on a cross for you but
[1:01:58] I'll tell you what he is he is your
[1:02:00] savior he is your god he said Behold the
[1:02:03] Lamb of God who takes away the sin of
[1:02:05] the world Behold a greater than Solomon
[1:02:07] is here Christ is in the midst of his
[1:02:09] people today
[1:02:11] you Lord you'll see him if you're
[1:02:12] looking for him you'll see him if you're
[1:02:15] looking for him if you're not looking
[1:02:16] for the spirit to come he'll never come
[1:02:18] upon you if you're not looking for the
[1:02:20] Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost will never
[1:02:22] enter in
[1:02:23] you've got to be looking for it
[1:02:26] and we go on down and and do we see the
[1:02:29] promise of Christ in us and I was
[1:02:31] thinking of this thought and and I
[1:02:33] thought of of the the false teachers
[1:02:35] that would arise
[1:02:36] and would wax you over and make you cold
[1:02:38] and formal and indifferent with one
[1:02:40] another
[1:02:41] it all goes together
[1:02:43] when you get cold and as brother Ben
[1:02:45] said this morning when you get cold and
[1:02:47] you get sticky
[1:02:48] you dry up it's like a cactus out in
[1:02:51] Arizona you get too close to it to reach
[1:02:52] out and poke you
[1:02:54] we don't want that happening in the
[1:02:55] church
[1:02:56] looking for the promise of the Holy
[1:02:58] Spirit it will come
[1:03:00] and it'll make you sweet and gentle and
[1:03:03] tender towards one another and in love
[1:03:05] with one another until when you come to
[1:03:08] church it's more about come more than
[1:03:09] just about coming to church but it's
[1:03:11] about coming to fellowship with one
[1:03:12] another and fellowship with Christ
[1:03:15] who is always a present among the
[1:03:17] Believers
[1:03:19] where two or three are gathered that's a
[1:03:20] promise
[1:03:22] it's always a promise every promise in
[1:03:24] the book should be ours but it depends
[1:03:26] on if you're looking for it to come or
[1:03:28] not
[1:03:28] the word will show you Christ every time
[1:03:32] why because Christ is the word you can't
[1:03:35] look at the word not see Christ brother
[1:03:37] Graham says it like this he said now you
[1:03:38] people sitting out there
[1:03:40] he said don't you dare look to a man
[1:03:44] look to Christ he is the one
[1:03:47] he said but he promised in the last days
[1:03:48] that he would manifest manifest himself
[1:03:50] in human flesh like he did there at
[1:03:52] Sodom
[1:03:53] now your flesh My Flesh let us just open
[1:03:57] our hearts and get our own thinking away
[1:04:00] and just let the word take its course
[1:04:03] tonight in us he said then we'll see
[1:04:06] God's great gifts of his spirit
[1:04:07] manifested before us
[1:04:10] God's gifts will be manifested before us
[1:04:13] it's if we can get our own flesh and our
[1:04:16] own thinking out of the way
[1:04:18] but he said and I highlighted this part
[1:04:21] don't you dare look to any man
[1:04:24] we get our eyes on a personality we get
[1:04:27] our eyes on a certain man and we start
[1:04:29] seeing the man instead of the message
[1:04:31] I've got one here and I'll just go ahead
[1:04:33] and say this he said friends don't look
[1:04:35] to me I'm your brother don't pay no
[1:04:38] attention to me I'm just a mortal I have
[1:04:40] to die like everybody else don't you
[1:04:43] listen to me but listen to what I've
[1:04:45] said
[1:04:46] let me say that again don't just listen
[1:04:48] to me but listen to what I've said
[1:04:50] we've got a lot of hearers
[1:04:52] but not doers because they're listening
[1:04:53] to the man but not listening to what he
[1:04:55] said he said not to do that so we're not
[1:04:58] going to do it right we're looking at
[1:05:00] the promise of it don't do that and
[1:05:02] he'll tell you what will happen
[1:05:04] he said don't listen to me listen to
[1:05:05] what I've said what I said is the
[1:05:08] message don't pay any attention to the
[1:05:11] messenger watch the message keep your
[1:05:14] eyes not on the messenger but on the
[1:05:17] message he said what it said that's the
[1:05:20] thing to look to so are you looking at
[1:05:23] the messenger or are you looking at the
[1:05:25] message you say they're wanting the same
[1:05:27] but remember when he was speaking and he
[1:05:29] was saying what God told him to say
[1:05:31] remember Jesus said I can't speak
[1:05:33] anything until the father shows me when
[1:05:35] brother Branham was speaking sure what
[1:05:37] he said was a prophet but don't just
[1:05:38] look to the human man he said I'm a man
[1:05:41] I make mistakes he said but look to the
[1:05:43] message of the hour look to the word
[1:05:45] that is Christ to you
[1:05:47] it's more than just a personality it's
[1:05:50] more than a man
[1:05:51] there was a story here and it happened
[1:05:53] brother Brahm tells that it happened in
[1:05:55] Vancouver British Columbia they were
[1:05:57] giving a prize for a boy that could ride
[1:05:59] a bicycle 12 inches across for 100 yards
[1:06:02] they'd give him a new Schwinn bicycle
[1:06:03] and all the boys they thought they were
[1:06:06] fine Riders they'd go downtown for their
[1:06:07] mama and get a basket of groceries and
[1:06:09] put it under their arm and ride back and
[1:06:11] never even touch the handlebars so each
[1:06:13] one knew he was going to win this
[1:06:14] contest
[1:06:16] he said they had a little boy
[1:06:17] there little mama's boy
[1:06:20] no one cared much for him they all got
[1:06:23] on their their numbers were called and
[1:06:25] they got on the board to the ride and
[1:06:27] each one fell off
[1:06:28] but this little boy wrote it right
[1:06:30] out to the end never made a wobble
[1:06:33] and all the boys got around him and said
[1:06:36] how did you do it
[1:06:38] he said I tell you boys here's where it
[1:06:40] was
[1:06:41] said I watched what you all were doing
[1:06:43] and I seen your mistake
[1:06:46] you were looking down like this
[1:06:48] trying to keep it on the board
[1:06:50] he said I just watched to the end and
[1:06:53] held steady
[1:06:54] brother Brahm says there you are
[1:06:56] there you are quit looking to the left
[1:06:58] quit looking to the right quit looking
[1:07:00] down but look to the end what's in store
[1:07:03] for the bride what's in store for you
[1:07:06] that love God you who endure to the end
[1:07:09] you shall be saved there's a promise for
[1:07:11] you oh I may not maybe I won't make it
[1:07:14] no you will make it
[1:07:16] you are going to make it you're more
[1:07:18] than able to make it
[1:07:21] I think sometimes we we get too down on
[1:07:24] ourselves
[1:07:25] we we get to looking at our
[1:07:27] circumstances we get to looking at
[1:07:29] things that may just not work out just
[1:07:31] right and we think that that's God
[1:07:32] judging us when it's really God just
[1:07:35] just kind of bringing us back onto that
[1:07:37] little 24-inch board and letting us ride
[1:07:39] out to the end if you get off and you
[1:07:41] fall you don't get the prize at the end
[1:07:43] but remember the scripture we read
[1:07:46] if you run this race with patience
[1:07:50] run the race with patients you we get so
[1:07:52] frantic sometimes and I I tell you I
[1:07:55] tell you what I don't have a lot of
[1:07:56] notes today but I just had this on my
[1:07:58] heart quit looking to the left and right
[1:08:00] quit looking at everybody else that goes
[1:08:03] for me too quit looking at everybody
[1:08:05] else it'll distract you from what's
[1:08:07] happening right now in the bride
[1:08:09] you say well there's fanaticism over
[1:08:11] here
[1:08:12] and there's dead people over here sure
[1:08:15] there is and it'll break your heart
[1:08:17] sometimes to see people over here that
[1:08:20] oh well we don't want anybody to shout
[1:08:21] in church and uh God forbid brother
[1:08:24] Branham talks about that you know if
[1:08:25] you'll go back to the word he tells you
[1:08:26] somebody say amen and everybody looking
[1:08:28] around you know and you can hear all
[1:08:30] their necks squeak you know popping and
[1:08:32] stuff because they ain't looked around
[1:08:33] in years because nobody else said amen
[1:08:35] but but somebody say man in church and I
[1:08:37] just boy that just gets their feathers
[1:08:39] all up and and I'll tell you what
[1:08:40] somebody shouts or somebody runs the
[1:08:42] aisle and and I had somebody tell me the
[1:08:44] other day they were just so in shock
[1:08:45] that people in the message run the
[1:08:47] aisles and and I I was like hey
[1:08:49] we're the original Pentecostals
[1:08:52] I don't know what you are but we are the
[1:08:54] original Pentecostals we are not a
[1:08:56] denomination but we have went forward
[1:08:58] from the things that were the things
[1:09:00] that were and we stayed with those
[1:09:02] things and we still have them say God
[1:09:04] never took anything out of the church
[1:09:05] we're looking at the fanaticism so we
[1:09:08] just want to cut out the shouting
[1:09:09] because somebody did it wrong somebody
[1:09:11] lived a bad life somebody lived a bad
[1:09:14] life and shouted but they forget to show
[1:09:16] you all those who lived a bad life and
[1:09:18] didn't Shout
[1:09:20] they forget to point out the dead
[1:09:23] churches that have got a pastor up there
[1:09:25] married four or five times they forget
[1:09:27] to point that out but because they don't
[1:09:29] like it they have a personal preference
[1:09:31] against it then they'll stand there and
[1:09:33] condemn that thing and I'll tell you
[1:09:35] brother Branham was there one time he
[1:09:37] also was sitting in the seat of the
[1:09:38] scornful and he was condemning those
[1:09:39] people out there he was looking at him
[1:09:41] and what did he see just fanaticism but
[1:09:44] the next thing you know when the spirit
[1:09:45] of God got a hold of him he was joining
[1:09:47] him
[1:09:48] and I think if we quit looking at the
[1:09:50] people and calling them Fanatics and
[1:09:52] quit looking over here and saying well
[1:09:54] well they got out of order well maybe
[1:09:55] they did let God take care of them but
[1:09:57] I'm going to tell you this tonight quit
[1:09:59] looking at the people
[1:10:00] brother Brandon said it like this
[1:10:03] sorry I gotta jump off here for a second
[1:10:05] the brother Brandon said it like this he
[1:10:06] said he said I'll sweep my steps
[1:10:09] you sweep your steps
[1:10:11] we forget that a lot I forget that a lot
[1:10:13] I sure do I'll admit I forget that
[1:10:15] sometimes sometimes I'm trying to sweep
[1:10:18] somebody else's step too and trying to
[1:10:19] be a good neighbor trying to be a you
[1:10:23] know he's trying to help a brother out
[1:10:24] why are you sitting there so dead and
[1:10:26] why are you why are you over here
[1:10:28] shouting too much I'm just trying to
[1:10:29] help you out calm down a little bit
[1:10:31] but maybe sweep yours maybe they need
[1:10:33] that blessing in their life
[1:10:35] maybe they need to shout a little bit to
[1:10:37] break some change in their life
[1:10:39] maybe somebody over here maybe they're
[1:10:41] quiet because you don't know what they
[1:10:42] went through
[1:10:43] I'll take up for them for a minute I
[1:10:45] sure will maybe they're sitting there
[1:10:47] and you don't know what they just went
[1:10:49] through on their way to church
[1:10:50] now I'll tell you I'll take up for you
[1:10:52] for a minute but here's the thing look
[1:10:54] to the word of God
[1:10:56] always look to the word and maybe maybe
[1:10:59] I don't believe you can ever sit still
[1:11:01] too long I don't believe that the word
[1:11:04] of God can go forward and not have some
[1:11:06] effect on your life now we have
[1:11:08] different types of shouters we have
[1:11:09] different types of people in the church
[1:11:11] we have some that like to scream we have
[1:11:12] some and and I remember a church I used
[1:11:15] to go to it was always the same ones
[1:11:17] they would always scream and and you
[1:11:18] know you knew about when it's going to
[1:11:19] so you cover the kids ears and they were
[1:11:21] sleeping you knew it is about you know
[1:11:23] the note that they hit on the piano is
[1:11:24] about to get their song leader the
[1:11:26] worship was just right and maybe there
[1:11:28] was something said that they just really
[1:11:29] liked and but you know I've condemned
[1:11:32] that in the past God forgive me for that
[1:11:35] I've condemned that
[1:11:37] because I thought well that's just
[1:11:38] fanaticism and you can go find quotes
[1:11:40] and say well that's out of order
[1:11:43] but let me just go and tell you
[1:11:44] something
[1:11:45] maybe they needed that
[1:11:47] maybe that helped them through something
[1:11:48] yeah
[1:11:49] the steam had to be let off just for a
[1:11:51] minute and it didn't hurt nobody sitting
[1:11:53] in the church
[1:11:54] it didn't hurt nobody
[1:11:56] but there's somebody sitting over there
[1:11:58] that are sitting quiet and they like the
[1:12:00] other quiet people who are fine
[1:12:03] but they're sitting over there and
[1:12:04] they're condemning that side of the
[1:12:05] church we'll just say that this side's
[1:12:07] loud and this side's quiet because it is
[1:12:09] but but uh there's more people over here
[1:12:12] see and uh so so just for the sake of
[1:12:15] the art these people in the middle
[1:12:16] they're staying with the word they're
[1:12:18] just right in the middle of the road but
[1:12:20] uh but over here you'll have somebody
[1:12:22] sitting quiet
[1:12:23] and that that's okay
[1:12:26] but then they start condemning the
[1:12:27] people over here that's where it becomes
[1:12:30] wrong
[1:12:31] that's where it becomes wrong because
[1:12:33] you're standing there thinking well well
[1:12:34] that's not how you worship God that's
[1:12:37] not how you do it
[1:12:38] but it is how they do it
[1:12:40] it's okay to worship God in your own way
[1:12:44] you've got some that just cry and that's
[1:12:47] okay
[1:12:48] I had a brother come to me and tell me
[1:12:50] he said the Tabernacle they'd only cried
[1:12:52] when they got blessed I I've heard tapes
[1:12:55] where they they shouted
[1:12:56] you know brother told me that oh they
[1:12:59] only cried he said we can't be doing
[1:13:00] stuff the Tabernacle didn't do well I
[1:13:01] can't help but that they were all
[1:13:02] methodists I mean I'm sorry I mean I
[1:13:05] received a Pentecostal blessing I can't
[1:13:06] help that I can't help but you know what
[1:13:09] it doesn't matter how they worshiped how
[1:13:12] are you going to worship when you see
[1:13:14] the word how are you going to respond to
[1:13:16] it
[1:13:17] you must believe it you must stay with
[1:13:20] it and we get all we get listen the wise
[1:13:23] men didn't find Jesus by sitting back
[1:13:25] and just waiting on something to happen
[1:13:27] they looked and looked and looked and
[1:13:29] finally they were stargazers I don't
[1:13:31] know how long they looked but they
[1:13:31] looked for the astrologers they looked
[1:13:33] for years maybe and maybe they were
[1:13:35] looking for that special star maybe for
[1:13:37] the sake of the argument these men were
[1:13:38] 100 years old or 75 or however they
[1:13:40] lived back in those days and they were
[1:13:42] they were older men maybe and they were
[1:13:44] just looking and they thought maybe
[1:13:45] something would never happen but they
[1:13:47] continued to look anyway and because
[1:13:49] they continued to look they finally saw
[1:13:51] a star and who was it nothing less than
[1:13:54] the word of God being born
[1:13:57] they looked and they saw the star and
[1:13:59] when they saw the star
[1:14:01] they rejoiced
[1:14:02] with exceeding great joy when I saw the
[1:14:06] word open to me I had to Rejoice for it
[1:14:08] I had to Rejoice because it was
[1:14:11] something inside of me it wasn't the
[1:14:12] flesh getting emotional it was something
[1:14:14] inside of me that pushed me to Rejoice
[1:14:17] but when they saw the star and they
[1:14:19] rejoiced then what's next they had to go
[1:14:21] find out what that star was representing
[1:14:23] what was where was that Messiah
[1:14:25] sometimes we have to have that
[1:14:27] experience to bring us to the word of
[1:14:29] God
[1:14:30] and that's what I want to show you today
[1:14:32] when you're looking for the word
[1:14:35] along the way you may need something to
[1:14:37] help you get there
[1:14:39] sometimes and I said in a church and and
[1:14:42] I don't I don't say the Lord didn't have
[1:14:43] me in this place because I believe
[1:14:44] everything happens for a reason but the
[1:14:46] Lord had put me in a place and and I got
[1:14:48] a certain way but then he brought me to
[1:14:50] this place and I'm thankful that he did
[1:14:51] I've experienced more joy right here
[1:14:53] than I ever did in my life but I'm
[1:14:54] telling you today the joy is not just
[1:14:57] for me the joy is not just for you but
[1:14:59] it's for all that will come and look for
[1:15:01] that same star
[1:15:03] what are you looking for I'm looking for
[1:15:06] the word to be made manifest in the
[1:15:07] bride in the last days I'm looking for a
[1:15:10] church that is ready for a Rapture I'm
[1:15:13] looking for somebody who can get out of
[1:15:15] their dead formal churchology and come
[1:15:17] up higher into the message of the hour
[1:15:19] because remember the message didn't come
[1:15:21] to bind you but it came to Lucia it come
[1:15:24] to set you free from your formalities it
[1:15:26] come to set you free from your church
[1:15:27] Creeds it took you out of a denomination
[1:15:30] and it brought you in to what brother
[1:15:32] Brandon would call a glorious light a
[1:15:34] glorious gospel and when you see the
[1:15:36] light you rejoice with exceeding great
[1:15:39] joy
[1:15:42] that's what you're looking at
[1:15:44] if the wise men would have saw the star
[1:15:47] and thought that's pretty nice that's a
[1:15:49] cool looking star
[1:15:51] and just sit there
[1:15:53] to never received the word
[1:15:57] all right
[1:15:58] I'm gonna preach anyway they'd have
[1:16:00] never received the word
[1:16:01] why because it does you no good
[1:16:04] to sit there in the seat of the scornful
[1:16:06] and condemn the people that are reacting
[1:16:09] because they're reacting a little out of
[1:16:11] order
[1:16:12] but they are actually responding to the
[1:16:16] word itself
[1:16:18] I saw the star and I'm going to follow
[1:16:21] that word
[1:16:22] I saw it there must be a body of Christ
[1:16:25] somewhere
[1:16:27] and they went and they journeyed and
[1:16:30] remember they journeyed for a long time
[1:16:32] I believe brother Branham says Jesus was
[1:16:34] maybe two or three years old when they
[1:16:35] found him it took him years to find him
[1:16:38] but at some point you'll find what
[1:16:40] you're looking for
[1:16:41] if you're looking for a dead Church
[1:16:45] you're gonna find it
[1:16:47] if you're looking for an emotional
[1:16:49] church you can find it
[1:16:51] if you're looking for the word to be
[1:16:52] preached in the power of the
[1:16:53] demonstration you'll find it
[1:16:55] and it won't be over here
[1:16:57] let's just stream every service and
[1:16:59] we'll sing until you do and it won't be
[1:17:01] over here to where if you just get a
[1:17:04] little bit out of order and scream the
[1:17:05] deacons are looking at you
[1:17:07] and they're sitting there and everyone
[1:17:08] they're going to stare you down and when
[1:17:09] you get out they're going to tell you
[1:17:12] we don't do that in our church
[1:17:15] David don't be standing up in church
[1:17:17] we don't allow that around here
[1:17:21] the devil don't like no praising God
[1:17:24] around here
[1:17:26] I don't care what the devil don't like
[1:17:29] it I don't care and the bride doesn't
[1:17:32] really care about those things anymore
[1:17:33] we don't want those things among us but
[1:17:36] why in the world are we so bound up with
[1:17:39] Creeds and things that try to tell you
[1:17:42] you say well well the brother Branham he
[1:17:44] he did he did Church order a certain way
[1:17:46] and and we must do it just that way and
[1:17:49] and then you just try to make it to
[1:17:50] where the spirit can't move he didn't
[1:17:52] take the spirit out of the church he
[1:17:54] tried to get those over emotional people
[1:17:56] to come under subjection to some order
[1:17:58] we don't have that problem here
[1:18:01] we don't have that problem most churches
[1:18:04] if you're be honest with you I've been
[1:18:05] to some Pentecostal churches in my time
[1:18:07] I haven't been to a message church yet
[1:18:08] they got that out of order
[1:18:10] I'll be honest with you I've been in a
[1:18:13] church I was at a UPC Church
[1:18:15] good people I'm sure
[1:18:17] they run the aisles and they danced and
[1:18:19] sang for maybe an hour before the
[1:18:21] preaching ever started when the
[1:18:22] preaching started it lasted about 15
[1:18:24] minutes we don't have that problem here
[1:18:26] either
[1:18:31] Mr JT said amen amen we don't have that
[1:18:35] see the word takes preeminence
[1:18:37] in a message Church you say well you're
[1:18:40] denominational no we're not
[1:18:41] denominational we are a part of the
[1:18:43] message of the hour brought to you by
[1:18:45] none other than God's servant and
[1:18:46] Prophet we are part of that message I I
[1:18:48] I'll identify myself I don't sign a card
[1:18:51] I didn't join a church but I'm part of
[1:18:52] that message I sure am I'm part of that
[1:18:55] message there's you can take yourself
[1:18:56] out of it if you want to I'm in it and
[1:18:59] I'm going to stay in it but let me tell
[1:19:01] you something we get to a to a place to
[1:19:04] where we just want to control the people
[1:19:05] and I'm not talking about our pastor
[1:19:07] here because if anybody is is not trying
[1:19:10] not controlling his brother being he
[1:19:11] tries not to do that but listen to me we
[1:19:13] want to control the people how you
[1:19:16] worship we want to control uh you know
[1:19:18] when you say Amen or we want to control
[1:19:20] the spirit of the lord we don't have
[1:19:22] time after this service to have the
[1:19:24] spirit of the Lord move so we'll just
[1:19:25] shut it down quick and get out
[1:19:27] where the spirit of the Lord is
[1:19:29] there is Liberty
[1:19:31] and if the spirit of the Lord is in a
[1:19:33] church there is nobody standing up there
[1:19:35] trying to shut it down
[1:19:37] where the spirit of the Lord is church
[1:19:39] take your Liberty and remember I'm not
[1:19:41] talking about just screaming and
[1:19:42] shouting every service but become free
[1:19:44] because you're looking at the word and
[1:19:46] you realize in the word is freedom
[1:19:50] in the word is is Restoration in the
[1:19:53] word is healing and when you see those
[1:19:55] things the Doom and Gloom just kind of
[1:19:57] Fade Away we don't see those things no
[1:20:00] more because we quit looking at those
[1:20:01] things we quit looking at the past and
[1:20:03] we leave the past in the past and we
[1:20:05] press forward towards the mark how many
[1:20:09] is pressing towards the Mark today we're
[1:20:11] not looking well you know they and the
[1:20:13] young people are condemned for being
[1:20:14] emotional remember this church then most
[1:20:16] of these young people have never been in
[1:20:17] a Pentecostal church but they've been in
[1:20:19] the presence of God and they found
[1:20:21] freedom they've been in the presence of
[1:20:24] God just long enough
[1:20:25] for the spirit of God to raise them up
[1:20:27] and I tell you don't condemn the Revival
[1:20:29] of the young people when you need
[1:20:31] Revival yourself
[1:20:34] you need it yourself yeah I'm not all
[1:20:37] for just jumping and shouting and
[1:20:38] screaming all the time because I know
[1:20:39] the word has to go forth and and I've
[1:20:41] been in Services where the quietness
[1:20:43] would come in and the people would cry
[1:20:45] at the altar that's wonderful that is an
[1:20:47] emotion by the way that is emotional
[1:20:49] worship whatever the spirit chooses to
[1:20:52] do is good
[1:20:54] but the spirit needs to have preeminence
[1:20:56] in every service not just in the
[1:20:59] meetings not just in when a special
[1:21:01] evangelist is here and I don't care how
[1:21:03] good of a speaker they are and maybe
[1:21:05] much better than another one but but
[1:21:07] listen when the when the pastor's
[1:21:09] standing here we should have the same
[1:21:10] preeminence as when your favorite
[1:21:12] evangelist is standing here if you go to
[1:21:14] a church with your favorite preacher
[1:21:16] that's good and maybe you shout and
[1:21:18] scream but listen church we should have
[1:21:20] the same feeling here in our church in
[1:21:23] your church you people that are not from
[1:21:24] here you should have the same reaction
[1:21:26] when the word Goes Forth if it blesses
[1:21:29] you remember the woman at the well she
[1:21:31] didn't stay at the well but she ran into
[1:21:33] the City and said come see a man what
[1:21:37] are you looking at she looked and she
[1:21:38] found the Messiah because the word had
[1:21:40] went forth and then it was time for
[1:21:42] rejoicing come and see a man who told me
[1:21:45] everything I ever done come and see a
[1:21:48] bride that's on fire for God come and
[1:21:50] see this end time body who is ready for
[1:21:52] a Rapture that's what I'm looking and
[1:21:54] for you say she ain't here yet I'm gonna
[1:21:56] stay here and I'm going to keep
[1:21:58] preaching and I'm going to keep holding
[1:21:59] on until we take a Rapture because I
[1:22:02] know that someday soon she'll be ready
[1:22:04] if she's not ready today she will be
[1:22:07] tomorrow if she's not tomorrow she will
[1:22:09] be the next day someday soon she'll take
[1:22:12] a rapture
[1:22:13] but you must look for it
[1:22:15] I'm not looking for
[1:22:17] for anything
[1:22:19] but the coming of the Lord
[1:22:21] and I believe it's soon
[1:22:24] I believe very soon is the coming of the
[1:22:26] Lord
[1:22:27] that's the thing we need to keep our
[1:22:29] eyes on
[1:22:30] have you seen the star
[1:22:33] and did you worship when you saw the
[1:22:36] star
[1:22:37] Christ appearing himself in the sky
[1:22:40] and just before I close
[1:22:43] I want to say this
[1:22:46] when we saw the cloud in the sky
[1:22:49] the cloud itself wasn't the body of
[1:22:50] Christ
[1:22:52] but it showed us
[1:22:54] where Christ was
[1:22:56] it wasn't a physical man called William
[1:22:58] Branham
[1:22:59] but it was an opening of the word
[1:23:02] and that revealing of the word is here
[1:23:04] it's open to us if you can accept that
[1:23:09] you'll Rejoice with exceeding great joy
[1:23:12] this bride can't sit still when she sees
[1:23:14] that opening of the word
[1:23:15] you can't do it I used to be one of
[1:23:17] those Quiet Ones in church I know that I
[1:23:19] used to never move
[1:23:21] but then I saw that there was an open
[1:23:22] book
[1:23:23] and it was mine and when you start
[1:23:25] eating it
[1:23:27] when you start eating it it tastes so
[1:23:29] good ah me and brother Ben we can sit
[1:23:31] down and eat if it's a good steak we
[1:23:33] don't sit there and just eat Motionless
[1:23:36] but we'll sit there that was good that
[1:23:39] was good we we like that good steak
[1:23:42] we're gonna eat some more maybe two or
[1:23:43] three more and so when you sit there and
[1:23:46] and you really like what you're eating
[1:23:48] you don't sit there with a frown
[1:23:51] I do sometimes I'm sorry I said I do we
[1:23:53] all come to church without having a bad
[1:23:55] day I know that I'm not I'm not
[1:23:56] preaching at you I'm preaching it myself
[1:23:58] okay
[1:23:59] I can have a bad day too and that's not
[1:24:01] I'm not not making excuses but I have to
[1:24:04] I have to I woe is me too sometimes but
[1:24:07] listen Church what we should do is when
[1:24:09] that word is being preached
[1:24:11] when we see the word being revealed for
[1:24:14] our day
[1:24:16] in a people
[1:24:17] in a people it's not no longer just on a
[1:24:20] tape
[1:24:21] but in a bride in a body
[1:24:25] when we see that
[1:24:27] then that's what's going to help us get
[1:24:29] it rapturing faith you know the
[1:24:31] rapturing faith a lot of people used to
[1:24:33] say and and I'll say it's true in a
[1:24:35] sense that rapturing Faith lays on the
[1:24:37] tapes
[1:24:38] the word is on tape that's right
[1:24:41] but don't leave it on the tapes
[1:24:44] the rapturing faith is in you
[1:24:47] rapturing faith is in me oh where is it
[1:24:50] it's the third pole it's in you
[1:24:52] Hattie Wright had it
[1:24:54] she had it way back in the 60s
[1:24:57] it's here quit looking for it to come
[1:25:00] you're looking for something big to
[1:25:02] happen when it's already here we looked
[1:25:05] for it and we found it and now we're
[1:25:07] looking for nothing more than the coming
[1:25:09] of the Lord but while we're here why not
[1:25:11] worship him just a little bit for what
[1:25:12] he showed us why not tell him thank you
[1:25:15] Lord for showing me this end time word
[1:25:17] thank you for making a way for me to
[1:25:19] take a Rapture that ought to make you
[1:25:22] happy that ought to make you at least
[1:25:24] smile that ought to make you listen the
[1:25:27] Baptists can't say that the Pentecostals
[1:25:30] can Scream and Shout but they don't know
[1:25:31] what you know that don't make us
[1:25:33] arrogant but that takes us to a place of
[1:25:36] understanding who we are and and
[1:25:40] understanding the revealing word for our
[1:25:42] day and that take us out of our dead
[1:25:44] formal traditions we leave those things
[1:25:46] in the past and we take a hold of a
[1:25:49] quickening power that is in the word of
[1:25:51] God and if that word don't Quicken your
[1:25:54] church it's time you grabbed a hold of
[1:25:55] the word of God and it will Quicken you
[1:25:58] it will raise you up it'll make you
[1:26:00] different it'll make you somebody it'll
[1:26:02] make you act like a Christian again
[1:26:04] it'll make you live a life this word
[1:26:06] will do all these things if you're
[1:26:08] looking for it to happen it'll take
[1:26:10] place what are you looking at today
[1:26:13] I'm looking for the word to make me
[1:26:17] something just like Jesus
[1:26:20] and if you see me and you see the rough
[1:26:22] edges and if you see me and
[1:26:25] and you say hey
[1:26:27] you say hey I see all your faults if
[1:26:30] you're looking for him you're gonna find
[1:26:31] plenty of them
[1:26:33] if you're looking
[1:26:34] brother Brandon said you're gonna get
[1:26:36] what you expect
[1:26:37] if you come to the message
[1:26:40] if the musicians would come I've got to
[1:26:41] stop
[1:26:43] if you come into the message and you're
[1:26:44] looking for mistakes you'll find them
[1:26:46] every time
[1:26:47] brother Brandon said he made mistakes
[1:26:49] but quit looking for him
[1:26:51] if all you dwell on is mistakes
[1:26:54] you're not getting fed
[1:26:55] you're giving room for the devil to
[1:26:57] breed unbelief in your life
[1:26:59] but if you'll come back
[1:27:01] to the scriptures
[1:27:03] and that word shows you
[1:27:06] that there is a bride that will be ready
[1:27:09] and then you see the word that was sent
[1:27:12] to dress that bride
[1:27:14] just accept it believe it
[1:27:18] and rejoice because your names are
[1:27:20] written in the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:27:22] do you believe that this evening
[1:27:24] rejoice and be exceeding glad because
[1:27:26] you've seen the body word of the son of
[1:27:28] man I've seen the body of Christ I'm a
[1:27:32] part of it
[1:27:33] I I came from somewhere where all I
[1:27:36] could see was just a glimmer of hope
[1:27:38] but then I stepped into a Manger
[1:27:41] I stepped into a little home somewhere
[1:27:43] where Jesus was and wherever he was I
[1:27:46] found him and I couldn't stay still no
[1:27:49] longer
[1:27:50] I couldn't hold my peace
[1:27:53] because something
[1:27:55] that I was looking for was laying right
[1:27:58] there
[1:27:59] and he was there
[1:28:01] all the time
[1:28:03] all I had to do was just go find him
[1:28:06] see Jesus has always been there
[1:28:08] healing has been there your whole life
[1:28:11] go find it
[1:28:13] if you're looking for healing I can show
[1:28:15] you in the word where it's at
[1:28:17] if you're looking for deliverance from a
[1:28:19] problem in your life
[1:28:21] I can show you a promise of Deliverance
[1:28:24] if you're looking
[1:28:26] for Christ to come in and give you the
[1:28:28] Holy Ghost I can show you there's a
[1:28:30] promise for that too
[1:28:32] there's promises all throughout the word
[1:28:35] look for them and when you see him
[1:28:37] that's Christ to you hold on to those
[1:28:41] promises
[1:28:42] and you will rejoice
[1:28:44] with exceeding great joy
[1:28:47] you'll worship God in some way
[1:28:50] some special way God will move upon your
[1:28:52] life
[1:28:53] and I've never seen
[1:28:55] a live person completely still
[1:28:59] you'll move in some way
[1:29:00] if there's no movement
[1:29:03] then maybe you're dead
[1:29:06] check it out
[1:29:08] have a doctor check yeah
[1:29:10] brother Branham calls it Dr Jesus
[1:29:13] take it back to the word feed on it let
[1:29:16] that re let that new life come in you
[1:29:18] let the quickening power take a hold of
[1:29:20] you
[1:29:21] and if you'll Stand Together
[1:29:22] as they play something
[1:29:27] how many have seen the star
[1:29:30] and have come to worship Him
[1:29:34] how many have seen the star
[1:29:36] and what it represents
[1:29:38] so it's more than just a story
[1:29:42] but he has now come into His People
[1:29:45] he began they saw him as a star
[1:29:47] he was born as a baby
[1:29:51] 33 year old man he went and died for you
[1:29:55] and then when he left he sent his spirit
[1:29:58] so that you could never have a bad day
[1:30:04] you will in your flesh
[1:30:06] but you'll never as a Christian
[1:30:09] if you look past that look past the
[1:30:11] flesh
[1:30:13] we're looking at our problems too much
[1:30:14] look past that look at the promise
[1:30:17] you get what you're looking for
[1:30:19] if you're always looking
[1:30:21] at your problems you're going to find
[1:30:23] more problems problem after problem
[1:30:27] but I'm looking today at a promise
[1:30:29] Abraham and Sarah had to do that for 25
[1:30:31] years you may have to do that
[1:30:33] your whole life right down to the end
[1:30:35] and all of a sudden you're like God why
[1:30:37] did you wait till I'm 100 years old
[1:30:40] to send me your promise
[1:30:42] he didn't say when but he said he would
[1:30:46] if you believe that he will send you the
[1:30:48] promise
[1:30:49] just continue to look for it
[1:30:52] don't look at your circumstances but
[1:30:54] look at the promised word
[1:30:56] do we have any believers in the house
[1:30:57] tonight
[1:30:59] I believe every one of you are going to
[1:31:01] make it because I don't look at just the
[1:31:03] flesh sitting here but I see a people
[1:31:06] who are hungry for the word of God and
[1:31:08] who can sit here and can endure service
[1:31:11] after service and you can sit here and
[1:31:14] you and maybe you don't feel good and
[1:31:16] maybe you have you've had trouble at
[1:31:18] home and and maybe there's there's death
[1:31:19] in your family or there's sickness and
[1:31:21] maybe some can't even come but remember
[1:31:23] quit looking at the symptoms and look to
[1:31:26] the promise of God
[1:31:28] there's a Healer
[1:31:30] there's something you need if you just
[1:31:32] look
[1:31:33] just look
[1:31:35] let's bow our heads together
[1:31:37] heavenly father as we we bring this
[1:31:40] service to a close
[1:31:42] Lord help us not to look at each other
[1:31:44] through the eyes of of hate or jealousy
[1:31:48] or
[1:31:49] or malice or anything Lord but help us
[1:31:51] to look to you
[1:31:53] and if we see you we can see our
[1:31:54] brothers and sisters and and see that
[1:31:57] you are more than able to take care of
[1:31:59] their problem too
[1:32:00] Lord God help us to just draw near to
