end and the things that we've experienced lately just make our hearts hunger more for that time of great reunion Lord and fellowship together beyond the veil I pray God that you would just move in this service this morning as I felt you already here today we can honestly say with our brother who sang it as well with our soul no matter what happens on the outside it doesn't matter what the economy does or what sicknesses might come on the earth what diseases may come or things may come and go we may be up or down but you're still alive and it is well with our soul the fact that you chose us and called us into this age and presented us with a message that somehow we had the faith to accept it Lord and was that of our own doing but it was all you Lord and the fact that that happened is just Lord it just gives us an assurance that we know it is well it doesn't matter what happens so well with our soul father I pray that your spirit would go from this place and also into every home were there watching today Lord Jesus we know that you're wherever they are father because they brought you with them and I pray God that you'd move in every home I pray that your spirit would continue to be with us Lord as Moses said if your spirit doesn't go with us we don't want to go are you granted today Lord father may you speak directly to our souls today may we hear Lord and be changed in Jesus name Amen amen thank the Lord for his presence this morning we're gonna read from revelations chapter five and verse one rule read verses one through four so such a privilege to be here today and I just feel the presence of the Lord I sometimes before these services and I feel very at peace today and we're getting more used to doing the things that we do but before these streaming services you get real nervous because we're trying to get the streaming right and do everything and you know we're setting all this up as we've been doing this and I want to thank you for for helping us and also being patient with us but something I did this morning but the Danny I can't laugh at you anymore because I didn't go live but I put an angry face on our video and an angry emoji on our video so those of you are watching that was me and I don't know how to take it off so so you just forgive me for that and we'll move on but I wasn't mad at anybody I just my thumb hit it and I messed up on that while I was trying to set it up so you all forgive me for that we all make mistakes don't we but I guess I'm just in that category brother Danny we just don't know how to deal with technology what are we gonna do so keep trying that's right so that was me next week the Lord willing we'll try to reopen the church their signs posted on the door that the Deacons have posted to comply with state regulations and and just some things that we're gonna ask you to do and and I know it's gonna be hard because when we all get back together we want to hug one another we want to shake each other's hand that's part of being together part of being a member of the bride you just feel that closeness and and just try to keep from from being too close during this time and especially in the church building because we're trying to comply with those regulations and to keep one another's safe as well so I understand how hard it is trust me every time I walk up here I want to shake brother David saying and I have to bump his shoulder but but it it works out and and we'll be through this before too long but the Lord willing you pray with me this week we'll be able to do this we'll be able to open next week everyone will be able to be here that wants to be here they can or that should be here and and we'll start working that direction thank you for your patience this has been the hardest thing that you could go through as a church and you've done admirably through this and I've stayed busy so it's not so hard for me because there's so many things you have to do but if you're sitting at home and you can't be around the people of God it's very hard to do and I appreciate you being faithful and I know that the Lord does as well revelations chapter 5 and verse 1 you're being faithful to him not to me or not to the church you're being faithful to God revelations chapter 5 and verse 1 I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the backside sealed with seven seals and I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice who is worthy to open the book and to loose the seals thereof no man in heaven nor in earth neither under the earth was able to open the book neither to look thereon and I wept much because no man was found worthy to open and to read the book neither to look thereon I pray the Lord would add his blessing to the word you may be seated this morning an abstract of title is a condensed history of the title to a particular piece of real estate it's a summary and I want you to kind of get this this morning and so we can continue this maybe I've purposely limited or we're going to talk about this morning so we can get it the way we need to but and by the Lord's help I want to preach this I don't want to just want to teach it but it's a summary of the original grant and all subsequent conveyances so every time the property changes hands there's another page put in the abstract it also includes all the liens on the property so you'd start at the beginning and then you begin to build the abstract up and but the Branham mentions an abstract 44 times the message most of the time referring to a real estate abstract there are other meanings to the word but he's referring to a real estate abstract for 244 times in the message beginning in 1953 all the way to 1965 you want to kind of get a background to what we're gonna be preaching on maybe for the next few weeks if the Lord is willing and I'm gonna try to work brother Alan but the Stuart in as well during this time but but just to kind of get an idea of what we're preaching on brother random references this and the breach he talks a lot about it in the Easter seal it is the rising of the Sun and in God's provided place of worship so the abstract and and this is actually a deed you probably can't see that here it'll be a little clearer on the screen maybe but but that's actually the first deed or the patent in an abstract that one is my great-great-grandfather that's the patent of the land that he come and homesteaded in Kabul Missouri here many many years ago back in the 1800s the president I think that sign that has Grover Cleveland and so it's many many years ago that would have been the first page and what that means is that the abstract there had to be an original owner of the property and they discovered some years ago I used to work in title and Oregon County Missouri when they put the 11-point National Scenic Riverway and they begin to try to expand some of that the government realized that there were people who lived over there who never had an a deed or a grant from the government they never had it and so what they realized is that their title could be forfeited they could force them to sell their land because they never got it from the original owner so an abstract goes all the way back in the most important document in that in an abstract other than the current deed is the original patent because it shows who the original owner was the original owner is important because you can't convey or you can't give somebody more than what you have right you have to be able to you can only produce what you have and I think that applies to us spiritually as well but I want us to think about that with God because title must be derived from somewhere it's got to come from somewhere if you own a piece of real estate it had to come from somewhere you didn't just walk onto it and although in some places there are laws where you can eventually claim it as yours but usually title comes from someone else and so when we think about the earth and brother branham talks about this book that was in the hand of the one who sat on the throne being the title deed to the earth and if you think about that that title deed to the earth is actually is actually the document that shows who it belongs to and it also shows the names of those who would be redeemed the names of those who are gods it shows what his property it describes his property oh my and so the abstract then shows that the original owner was God and we find that in Genesis 1 and 1 in the beginning God created the heaven and the earth so God is the owner and he's going to give something to his people now he had the absolute right to convey it to and you had the right to place whatever limitations that he wants to on it right so God in the beginning created male and female let's just take that for an example God created them male and female he has a right to distinguish what male and female is he has a right to tell us even how he should dress and how we should act he said why would God be concerned with that because it's his property he made it in the beginning he is the original owner and so he has a righty the original owner affects the title all the way through because if the original owner was the US government you get it from the US government then as it comes down it continues to have the rights and privileges that American land would have but if the original owner with some other government you would live in another country right and so the original owner being God he had a right to convey what he wanted to convey and so Gabriel's instructions to Daniel but the brand simply says he said who was we find who was we find was the original owner God himself so if you go to the first page of that abstract all the way at the bottom if you've got one maybe you've got one at home I wish I had one I've worked with them all this time and I don't have one at home but if you've got one at home usually the first page the bottom is the oldest deed so you go all the way to the bottom and you find your first page where does it come from if it's a good title it comes from the United States government but if you take a son or daughter of God back to the original where did they come from they come from God so he had the absolute right to give to Adam what was his and we find an example of this in in John chapter 8 in verse 38 where Jesus comes to the earth and he begins to examine the title that the Pharisees and the Sadducees said that they had he begins to look through the book and begin to say you're not who you say you are your your deed doesn't go back your chain of title your abstract doesn't go back to the original owner notice what he says I speak that which I have seen with my father and you do that with your thing with your father the answered and said unto Him Abraham is our Father jesus saith unto them if you were Abraham's children you would do the works of Abraham but now you seek to kill me a man that hath told you the truth which I have heard of God this did not Abraham notice he said you do the deeds of your father and they said unto him we're not serpents eat we'd be not born of fornication we have one father even God Jesus said unto them if God were your father if your abstract went back where it was supposed to if he was the original owner you would love me for I proceeded forth and came from God so he said the original owner or the original essence of Who I am is gone he said and neither came I of myself but he sent me so in other words he said I'm able to trace my lineage back and you're not he based said on how they acted now the original owner he's who I want to focus on this morning he has complete control over the status of future owners he can rent the property he can sell the property he can sell it with conditions he can make covenants with the people that he's given it to try title your title that you hold as a grand G as the owner of property is never greater than the original owners you can't give where he can't give what he does in half so he can only give but he doesn't have to give all of it and we find that he was created the heavens and the earth but he didn't give man title to the heavens but he gave him title to the earth so it gives him a specific piece of real estate to have dominion over job 38 and 4 let's look at this original owner because job is complaining about the things that he's going through in the trials of life and some of us where the Caleb we do the same thing we begin to almost did recognize you back there we begin to complain and and we begin to worry about the things that we've went through it and as we go through life we don't realize he's got it in his hands he's the original owner he has rights to be able to affect her life and so he told jovi said where were you when I laid the foundations of the earth declare if thou hath understanding if you're gonna complain about it you're gonna talk and wonder where I'm at where were you Amen who has laid the measured sir how's it sound knowest who has stretched the line upon us in other words who who knows the description of it he did because he was the original owner he said I know exactly how far the seas go I know exactly how deep the earth is I know exactly the distance between the earth and the heavens I know everything about it oh if he said if I know that he said where were you why because he's comparing his own status of ownership with with job's all you do is walk on and all you do is benefit from it but here I own it all it belongs to me and so I have a right to do it that what I want to he said we're a partner the foundations are fastened who laid the cornerstone thereof when the morning stars sang together all the sons of God shouted for joy so he used this also real estate language we says who laid the measures who stretched the line who described it and I say at forty five and five God again is asserting his rights and I think sometimes God does that and we don't understand but God says to the claim he says you're the clay I'm the Potter all right and sometimes God reminds the world who he is right he didn't have to Agrippa when he stood there and they said it's the voice of a god and and he began to speak and God smote him why did God do that you know he was going to come into judgment anyway wasn't gods but God was reminding them who was in charge right and I think sometimes things like we've been through lately it's God reminding us who's in charge it's not us it's not a passenger it's not a preacher it's not not a church it's not a government it's not anybody else but it's God and ultimately he's the one who can make life go right and so and I said forty five and five he said I am the Lord and there is none else there is no God beside me I girded these Oh thou hast not known me he said I'm the original owner look look look on the patent you can see it's my name there he said I girded me though that's not normally verse six that they may know from the rising of the Sun and from the West that there is none beside me I am the Lord and there is none else I formed the light oh my and create darkness I make beats and create evil and why did we have the coronavirus because God allowed it he said I do this I the LORD do all these things drop down you heavens from above let the skies pour down righteousness left the earth open let them bring forth salvation let righteous to spring up together I the LORD have created it verse nine wohin to him that striveth with this maker let the potsherd strive with the potsherds of the earth shall the clay say to him that fashion is it what make his style or that work he has no hands that's what they're doing today is what the Governor of New York did not long ago God didn't have nothing to do with this we'll find out he's got less control than he thinks he does when I kiss now you've got no hands you have no ability to affect the earth he said can the clay say that to the original owner they been won't to him thus saith unto his father what began of Sal we'd say to our kids maybe you don't say this but I've heard it said I brought you into this world and I can take you out I'm the original owner amen I'm the original owner and he said what beget is Sal you say to your father what began a sour to the woman what that's uh brought forth thus says the Lord the Holy One of Israel and his maker ask me of things to come concerning my sons and concerning the work of my hands come in you mean in other words you want to know what's gonna happen ask me he said I've made the earth and created man upon it I even my hands my hands have stretched out the heavens and all their hosts have I commanded this is called sovereignty sovereignty God made it he has a right to define it he has a right to say what it is and we could take this into every area of our life and I don't want to get too far off the track but God set in the church apostles prophets pastors evangelists and teachers if God said it in the church he made it right no one can take it out if God said there's healing he made it he said I'm the Lord that healeth see that's who I made it we don't understand why we just say we'd rather just be well not healed does that make sense we'd rather just never get sick but God put healing in the church why why because he made it as part of his character as part of who he is he has the right I don't understand why we have why we call for the elders of the church to lay hands on the sick I don't completely understand that but he made it right he has a right to say it to put it in his word I don't understand why the same God who said speak what you have need of also said the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much and on one hand you could just walk out and speak to the mountain and on the other hand you cry to God every day I don't understand how Jesus himself could get in the Garden of Gethsemane as if it's possible let this cup pass from me why wouldn't he just accept it but God made it that way he said nevertheless not my will but thine be done yes sir right I heard a preacher say it this way when talking about predestination people say well that's that would be awful of God would be unjust of God to save some and condemn others but he has a right to have a family he has a right to have children he is a right to have a church has a right to have a bride has a right to have a pocketful of change in a silver dollars and pennies and nickels and whatever else said he wants to do he has a right to do it he has a right to call a man who lived all of his life as a drunkard drug anacott and a donor and everything else he can call that man and a man that lives seemingly a good life not be cold at all why would he call Paul to do what he did why would he call the ones in the Bible because God maintains the right to do the work in his own creation and we've got to let him do that amen it's God I don't get mixed up in God's work and that's why I've told you that's my heart I I don't want to make people come to church I want to get mixed up in God's work I want to preach the word and the people that can come and can sit under that ministry then let them come and sit and those that can't go and go somewhere else I don't want to mess with God's work I'm not gonna tell you everything that you need to do and what what cars you need to buy and stuff like that I'm just not going to do it God needs to do his work but God does this work are you with me now God needs to God has certain prerogatives that he has over the preacher over the singer over everybody else we have to let God do his work not that we don't fall under headship but we need to make sure we're under the headship of God now look he said I made it my hands did it now as I said he has the right to put certain conditions on his conveyance or covenants and we still call it that today that when you make promises and indeed your covenant with someone and so he has a right to covenant with those who he made with those who are his is a right to make a covenant and he has a right to change covenants and he's the only one who has the right to change covenants right again if there's going to be a new covenant made it can't be made by the human race must be made by God we find that in Genesis 17 and 1 we find Abram was ninety years old and nine the Lord appeared to him and said unto him I am the Almighty God I am the Almighty God walk before me and be thou perfect I am El Shaddai I am the Almighty God walk before me be thou perfect and perfect and I will make my covenant between me and thee he doesn't say we'll make it together he doesn't say as he did the first covenant if you will I will he said I'll make my covenant with you he said and between me and thee and will multiply thee exceedingly now brother branham taught us in the masterpiece and you can go and find many other things other than what we're gonna read today but I'm gonna try not to - just read too much but I want you to understand this he said now we find that the end of the Louvre Ian's world comes along and destroyed the whole thing he said because the covenants that was made was made conditionally so that's why the flood came and all of that he said the covenants that was made was made conditionally if you will not do this if you will do that God the great sculptor had seen that man could not keep a covenant you just can't do it there's just no way at all we can't keep our promises can we say we're gonna do a certain thing and it's completely subject to the will of God and it's subject to our own mistakes I read a quote the other day where brother brother said he had visions and he said he's and he talked like it was something that happened I don't know that happened all the time but something that had happened several times where he said I had a vision he said and God told me exactly what to do and I missed it and we find that brother Randall dealing with the brown bear and all of that that there would be a certain thing God told him to do and maybe circumstances made it where he couldn't do that or or somehow but it's a failure on our part not God's right it's a failure on our part and so man cannot keep a covenant because he's human he just can't do it he's born in sin shipping iniquity at all he says in brother branham did not say message he talked about I believe it was mr. Bruce it's the one that he had the interview with and he said on the interview a few minutes ago he said I was speaking to a person in the room mr. president now that interview is on tape he said but brother branham she said but brother branham I have so many things that I know that's wrong and the godly little woman I said but look sister you don't look at yourself it's just what your desire is what you try to do now that seems too simple for us because we want to try to figure out how to say well did this happened at a certain time and no what's your desire what do you try to do what do you really want if we could put it that way he said if you really love the Lord you try to serve him with all your heart and then all your mistakes is hid in the blood of the Lord Jesus aren't you glad for that today he said see he made away and he goes on he said so he began now taking men from his covenants of saying that if you will I will and he begin with the men called Abraham and give to Abrahamic covenant unconditionally and so he says every time he would start a masterpiece Satan would get it because the word he said but when he started with Abraham he said I have already done it he said now this is unconditionally not if you will I will but I've already done it I love this he said now he the sculptor we could say the original owner the person with the rights all of the rights the person has a right to affect the clay to mold it he the sculptor is determined to have this masterpiece and so we find that there had to be a conveyance of the title so we come from the original owner and he creates Adam and he gives him what he gives him dominion over the earth Genesis 1:26 God said let us make man in our image after our likeness let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over the cattle and we're all the earth over creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth so God created man in his own image and the image of God created he him male and female created he them and God bless him and God said unto them be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth and subdue it and have dominion over the fish of the sea I would quote that every time I go fishing brother Harvey he said have dominion over the fish of the sea and he says in the fowl of the air and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth man has dominion that word means to tread down or to reign over to rule over to take but the brandon takes it maybe a little bit further than what we would think of it maybe further than I would have hadn't been him that said it but he says it this way said a man was made to be God he said to be a God do you know that he's in the image of God he's the son of God he's like him he was given a domain Genesis 1:26 dominion over the whole earth that's right he ruled the earth he ruled the animal kingdom all the other kingdoms all but the kingdom of God above right he was a God of the earth God he said it's the God of the universe everywhere but his son had this earth under his own control see that's what God gave him God gave him a title to the earth he said he could speak he could name he could say he could stop nature he could do anything he wanted to but when he did that he said he lost his inheritance oh that ought to make us think - today he could do anything he wanted to when he did anything he wanted to he lost his inheritance are you with me Helen so God had to do more than just make a new covenant he had to put something within us so would want to make us do it well just want us to make us want to do it right he had to give us a desire because we didn't have that desire and human beings always ran from God so God had to place his own life inside of you to make you have a desire to serve God now he said no Adam could say this mountain here be moved over there and it would do it enough you own land and you get just certain part of it you want to move there's a hill there if you've got enough time and money in it want to put up effort in it you can move it you can take it and take a loader and a bucket whatever and then and push that a bulldozer push that mountain down if you if you won't want to bad enough you can move it what's your property God had that kind of right to create the earth and he give Adam those kind of rights Big Ben to have dominion over the earth but the Ben said it would do it Adam could say let this tree here be plucked up and planted over here it would do it for he had complete supreme control as a minor God under God our Father because he was the son of God and so we find then that in this in this page so we we've gone we've looked at the first page of the abstract we see that God is the original owner we flip up to the next page and we find that not only is God the original owner but man took possession of it right so the second deed if you'd look at it would say from God to Adam right to Adam now so the Covenant was made in Genesis 2:16 now this deed wasn't just God owning it but he said I'm gonna make conditions in this deed there's going to be a certain little thing they have to do or not do in order to keep possession this Dominion in the earth and so Genesis 2:16 says the Lord God commanded the man saying of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil thou shalt not eat of it for in the day that thou eatest thereof he said thou shalt surely die so here's the cause if someone said that whatever we put in in big friend on the front page we take away in small print on the second page so God is not taking away his Dominion but he's saying it's subject to something it's subject to obedience but he said I'm gonna put you on a free moral agency where you can disobey you oh my now look now I want you to notice as we're going through this that at that time Adam and Eve were one it's not yet separated Eve from Adams body and so but the Harvey this means that what he spoke to Adam he spoke to Eve - there's no record that even joined any lesser privileges than Adam before the fall she was in him when the covenant was made right so being in him and part of him whatever was granted to her was granted to him because she was him quite literally at that time so he could say I give to you Adam Dominion he was giving it to Adam he said male and female created he them and Eve because that spirit lay within him that rib was still there so no lesser privileges that'll be important as we go on now this made the things that were in the garden Adams personal property had to deed to the earth and he can look out at all the animals and he could begin to name them Genesis chapter 2 and verse 19 out of the ground the Lord God formed every beast of the field every fowl of the air and brought them unto Adam because Adam had dominion over these things to every fowl of the air and brought them unto Adam to see what he would call them and whatsoever Adam called every living creature that was the name thereof and Adam gave names to all cattle and to the fowl of the air to every beast of the field but for Adam there was not found to help meet for him now he had personal property but the woman was not his personal property she was part of him and in the in the guard and they were co-equals there had not been a fall there was not two separate covenants until the fall before the fall there was one covenant they both had to abide by the same thing and yet she is a well the man calls the byproduct which sounds like something that's Lester but what it means is it comes from him it comes from the original and people use that as something a lesser thing about products not a lesser thing it just means it's part of the original and so she was part of the original she's not his property she's part of him right and they have a 50/50 relationship which we can say it that way but but yet they they own the earth and so it's it's unique because it's a marriage relationship and justice 221 the Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam and he slept and he took one of his ribs and closed up the flesh instead thereof and the rib which the Lord God had taken from man made he a woman and he brought her into the man had him said this is now bone of my bones flesh of my flesh she shall be called woman because she was taken out of man so we find then that here they are there and as a unit that's a couple they have rights dominion over the earth and I want you to think of both of them in that in that situation they did now they fulfill different roles because she was the feminist part and he was the masculine part but yet they were equal in their decision-making they did things together are you with me now now it's going to come down because they'll we realized that it did not stay in that condition or that's all the abstracts would be today God transferring it to Adam go out the original owner and him transferring it to Adam there's a patent we could close the book but Adam could not maintain the status that he had look it and when you lose the status of title when you lose it because of something you did it's called a forfeiture a forfeiture and this was what we would call a voluntary forfeiture this is something that Adam gives up knowing he's giving it up oh my now there's a saying in in legal realms that always have stuck with me that equity abhors a forfeiture in other words there's certain Maxim's in law that have been handed down from generation to generation one of them is that equity aboard the forfeiture equity being what's right what's just the law it dislikes someone just giving up their property and that's why if you look at a deed in Arkansas in Missouri it's got a dollar amount on it it usually says ten dollars someone will say for love and affection it's called consideration they don't want you just giving something for nothing right the law requires something to be given and something to be paid so a forfeiture is the total loss of a right or a thing because of the failure to do something that was required and a total loss is a very stiff penalty to have a total forfeiture of title a loss of title you have to almost willingly give it up you have to ignore all the tax bills right because here in America we own land subject to taxes right taxes are a first lien on all property in the United States except on what's owned by the government and accept certain exemptions like churches but you take a normal piece of property owned by a private landowner it taxes our first lien so if you don't pay your taxes eventually they'll take it away but what do they do they send you notice after notice after notice after notice why they don't want you to lose it and God made it very clear to them what they had to do for the steward to keep it and this I think he kind of gets rather serious for us this morning because God has made it very clear to us what we need to do but not to keep it ourselves but to receive him so he can keep it because he will keep what's his but here they had to keep it themselves in so it this stiff penalty it wouldn't be fair and the law even understands that today a court will refuse to permit an unreasonable forfeiture so God put them in the earth and he gives them every blessed thing he could give them every right every bit of peace every bit of joy they had everything you think about it they had everything they could ever want at their fingertips they didn't have to struggle for it they didn't have to fight for it they didn't have to go in and shoot a bunch of people to keep Mostel hand they had everything right there nothing to hurt nothing to destroy everything was good so god puts him in an extremely good position he said this is yours it's all yours just don't take of the tree look it's it's yours he puts him in the position or for them to lose it would be just them walking away from it purposefully now Eve being a byproduct if we can say it that way but being someone who wasn't in the original creation she could fall it also means she could be redeemed so our redemption had to come by a woman but it's why we don't God we don't have women preachers because after the follows two covenants women don't run the church because and that's not the plaintiffs way that we can say it but we just we don't allow that because there's the two covenants but one day it's going back equal again right and I believe we are equal as sons and daughters of God in Christ there's neither male or female but when it comes to the natural things and the preaching of the word and things like that a woman can't do that there's a reason because Eve could be deceived she was deceivableness not de siiva believed had just been deceived and left and did what she did God couldn't have allowed a total forfeiture because he made her or allowed her to be deceivableness how we all fall oh my that's why a pastor told me one time he said every time there's a problem in a marriage and maybe I'm getting too far off of this but I think it's important this morning he said if there's a problem in a marriage you said the first thing that I do he said and he said I take a young couple that's just getting marry he said I bring them in and I'll look at him I say now in ten years if she's just the retreat prostitute he said I'm gonna come and ask you what you did why because a man has responsibility man Adam had responsibility but when we take up responsibilities we think well Adam you had a responsibility to stay oh but I just thought the heart of God Adam was like God and being like God he he had redemption in him there's something in him that wanted Redemption not only for himself but for her and the son of God don't want just redemption for themselves they want redemption for her for the bride amen and so here Adam with this responsibility actually causes the whole human race to fall by going out with Eve in order to win her back now those who are lost will reject every attempt at redemption you don't go to hell easily God knows who will and who won't and yet even gives Cain an opportunity and said if you do what your brother did and he gives every one of us an opportunity but the Brandon talks about how that if you go to hell you you'll pass every roadblock that God puts in your way you'll put where the RAM talks about how song services can be a roadblock to to going to help God allow songs to be sung he'll I messages to be preached you put something in your way there'll be something there to tell you that you should repent and even your conscience and everything else so he puts everything in front of you he gives you every chance that he can and even time lingers on to give us the opportunity to repent and we find us they went on now how did they lose it well the serpent gives some bad legal advice in Genesis chapter 3 and verse 4 don't go to the serpent for legal advice don't go to the serpent for counseling right because the serpent doesn't have your best interest at heart he'll give you bad legal advice for momentary pleasure the serpent Center to the woman you shall not surely die for God doth know that in the day you eat thereof then your eyes should be open you should be as God's knowing good and evil but look they already were brother branham tells us that they already were gods so he tries to deceive them into thinking they had less than what they had don't we see that all around us today there's so many when you find a deceiver when you find the false prophet you find someone who tries to tell the people what they don't have and tries to put it off into another age and say well when so-and-so comes back or so and so it's gonna do this and so you gotta listen to this preacher you've got to belong to my church you got to move across the country with me what's he doing he's a deceiver because what he does is he ties it to himself and then he says sense that you've got to do that in order because there's something yet unfinished but God said it's a finished work so Satan says you're not what you could be and I can make you better God does know she'll be as gods listen we don't need the Serpent's program to have dominion we already have it so well where is it it's been restored where is it the word is naívi all right and with all my heart I believe that don't let circumstances talk to you out of what you have and it's the biggest thing I've seen it all through my life how people will will look at the Word of God and say well we need more of this we need more emotion or we need more sensation or we need a better ministry we need another prophet we need this know we have exactly what we need now look he said the serpent said God is a good God and he was he is a good god he abhors the forfeiture to do everything he can to keep it from happening but he had already done that for them but he will keep his word the good companies adjust goddess brother Branham says over and over again and so we find that Adam and Eve as a couple Eve listens to the serpent and she is overtaken by him she is seduced by him and then Adam commits the sin with her as well now titled to the earth was held in Adam and Eve if we could say it that way today the way we would do that legal is Adam and Eve husband and wife Adam and Eve husband and wife and there's a legal doctrine that still exists today which they're trying to do away with because it doesn't work for gay marriage it just doesn't work but used to in a marriage had a special status in title you hold a status in title as a married person in most states that no one else hopes and it's called a tenancy by the entireties and what it means is when you put both your names on a deed it states that you're a married couple that you both own 100% of the title so if a lien is put against your wife it shouldn't attach although in Arkansas they make you pay it off anyway but it shouldn't attach to your property and in Missouri I can let that go because because it doesn't attach because just because it's against you but it's not against him his title is clear and her title can't affect his because they don't own it 50/50 it'll own it like a partnership but they own it together are you with me a hundred percent and only as a married couple can you do that and the purpose of that is so title can easily pass to your heirs and so someone wouldn't get married to someone they didn't know and then them getting title and then encumber all of their property they lose everything because the person they married so there's those two things now so they don't hold 50:50 they hold together their one flesh and I think we can look at that scripture later that they're one flesh brother branham said that the serpent separated Adam and Eve sinned Jehovah Jireh he said notice he separated Adam and Eve he separated them and she fell that's the same thing he wants to do that's what's so dangerous to be separated from Christ there's times when you'll be separate like we have been from each other but don't ever become separated from Christ don't ever walk away from him her from his word because that's what the devil wants you to do when they're there come a difference between her and Adam he separated Eve and Adam and she fell Adam went with her oh my he said Adam was not deceived Eve was deceived but Adam the first Adam was God's son also and he went out because of the love of Eve to try to bring her back because he loved her now look he could have let her go put her away and he had every right to do it but if he had put her away her part of that status would not be redeemable anymore I hope you understand this the redemption would only continue would only be an option if they were married you could put her away but he can't just take away what's hers because it was given to her in him that make sense so in order for the earth to be redeemed as a whole both of them had to be redeemed couldn't be just one of them don't you see that just the same as Christ came and died for you and I that's the same way that you and I have Redemption today and it's guaranteed it's got to happen he's got to have a bride because if he has no bride he has no works are you with me now he can't guarantee title to the earth without her because she was part of it hey Ben just the same as Abraham God could not smite Sarah even though she laughed but but she was part of Abraham hey Beth and she had rights in the land but they were hindered they were they were forfeited because of what she did but the only way to bring redemption back was not for Adam to keep his rights but to give his up to hey Ben he said for the love of each to try to bring her back because he loved her but God forced saw the bride in the groom he says see said to save his wife like Adam he had to go with her listen to save his wife he had to go with her Adam knew what he was doing Eve didn't know what she was doing but Adam walked out with his wife and Jesus took his last place and became sin for her aren't you glad he did this warn him remember he said he become you he stood your punishment that you might stand in his place so we're looking before go back we said well that's strange how could they forfeit it what happens to it does it just this the title just flowed out there for anyone to grab hold of it what happens to it well they forfeited it by sinning and so Satan's laid claim on him squatted on it if you could put it that way you laid claim on it said it's mine that was death Satan said they're mine they've got to die because you said so God but Satan couldn't hold the title himself because he too was a sinner he couldn't hold the title and he was unredeemable now but the brother said God first saw her and he took his wife's place and he stood your punishment and so now they've walked out and we see them being evicted from the garden they're walking away in for the RAM gives the drama of it how that the he kills the lamb and the blood running down their legs they're walking down the garden you can hear the slap of the skins so walking out of the garden an angel stood there with a bloody sword stood there guarding the way fiery sword guarding the way the tree of life and they couldn't come back in but there had to be something in the deed to begin with there had to be some covenant that would bring them back in the rightful position now we would call that today reversion clause a lot of old churches out in the country are like this if they would need a church and then they would say as long as they have Church in it then its tears but if they don't have church anymore it goes back to the original owner a lot of old churches are like that but the Tim Pruitt's Church that he had the old one in Louisiana was that way the titles that you go back to the original owner well after a hundred years who's the original owner well they're very very hard to find so those churches you can't sell them you can't really do anything with them it's just there it's just it's a legal morass it's just it just doesn't there's nothing you can do with it because you have to find the original owner they still have rights oh oh I hope you're listening to me today he still had rights because he made them and they were not only made by him they were his children so he had certain rights whether Danny to them to say like he has rights to us today people don't want to be told what to do but he has rights to you he said well I don't want to be told how I should wear my dress I don't want to be told how I should God whether I should cut my hair and I don't want to be told how to act among my coworkers but he has rights and he was served to himself the right of redemption now listen he could not trust human beings with the title so he come down himself very bad amen had a person one time left the office and lost a payoff on the way to the bank they went by the mail saw it first and put it down the mail side you couldn't trust them that person eventually got fired because we just couldn't trust them to handle the payoff God couldn't trust Adam he couldn't trust Elijah he couldn't trust Moses he couldn't trust David so he he put the payment you cost the payment to be something that he did himself he came down himself and people did want to believe in two guards you know in a lot of it as semantics people take things but the red one says but but he was God he had to be because no one else could make that payment now listen if a thing or person ever belonged to God it cannot be lost must be redeemed and it belonged to him for this purpose to be redeemed now Ruth chapter 4 and verse 3 I want us to look at this really quick and I won't hold you as long as you think I'm going to this morning because we're just gonna stop rich chapter 4 in verse 3 he said unto the kinsman Naomi that has come again out of the country of Moab sell us a parcel of land which was our brother elimi Lex and I thought to advertise these saying buy it before the inhabitants before the elders of my people because he he could make a claim on it what he's doing he's clearing the title now listen what he says buy it before the inhabitants before the elders if that will redeem it redeem it but if thou will not redeem it then tell me that I may know for there is none to redeem it beside thee and I am after thee now notice the nearer kinsman said I will redeem it he said I'm gonna make a claim and then said Boaz remember if you buy the field you get the title to the earth if you buy it of Naomi you must also buy it of Ruth you can't restore it without restoring the marriage relationship babe it don't you see what he was feeling with Adam and Eve if he had put her away it could never be restored but he went out with her so that he could know that the marriage relationship could be restored so that the title would be clear hey Beth she has rights to it too and he said you must also buy it of Ruth the wife of the Dead to raise up the name of the Dead upon his inheritance and kinsmen said I cannot redeem it for myself that was the fact that changed what changed its the fact you would to marry her and he couldn't do that hey Ben she was a bride that was meant for bow ass he couldn't do that because it would Mar his inheritance I cannot redeem it for myself less time on my own inheritance because then her children would inherit that property you wouldn't do me any good he says let's not Mar my own inheritance redeemed out my right to thyself for I cannot redeem it hey brother Brahim tells us now the forfeited title deed is now in the hands of the original owner Almighty God the title deed to the earth and to eternal life when Adam forfeited it didn't Satan's dirty hands could not take it so it went back to its original owner God himself hey man he said we're gonna find it just in a minute there he sits on the throne with it in his hand the title deed Hey oh I just I couldn't get past this this morning it's the original owner he has it in his hand it didn't just get lost but Adam lost it when he walked out was even didn't just go anywhere Satan tried to take it he couldn't take it but win back to the original owner it is now in the hands of the original owner there he sits on the throne with it in his hand the title deed but the random claps his hands together two times oh that makes me feel religious the title deed to eternal life abstract title deed to eternal life when Adam forfeited it for wisdom as to the faith it went back to the hands of the owner Almighty God he said what a great thing brother Branham says Oh hallelujah I hope you Christians see it he says we are the salt of the earth God gave this to his sons he gave us the jurisdiction over all nature all animals all life everywhere do you know what the coronavirus is it's a life that feeds off of a life that's right that's what it is it's a life form it's a form of life but he gave you jurisdiction over all life everywhere any bet you give you jurisdiction over all life everywhere but Adam our fathers forfeited to Satan but where does it fall back to the rightful owner God who made it hey Ben no brother man says that's the reason John wept because if no one could get that book all creation everything was gone if no one could get it all creation and everything was gone she would just simply turn back to atoms and molecules and so forth cosmic line not even be creation person nothing else because Adam lost the rights to that book he forfeited it when he listened to his wife and she listened to Satan's reasonings instead of the Word of God it was forfeited he said then it couldn't go back into the dirty hands of Satan who tempted her out of the way and he didn't go back just for molecules and atoms where did he go into the hands of the original owner into the hands of the original owner he was not an absentee owner he was there he watched him walk out of the garden and he took the book back in his own hands hey man he said I'll make it covered at this time that I could they can keep amen because it's I will not they will look he said he couldn't go back he went back to its original owner like any abstract deed would do he goes right back to his original owner that was God the Creator who made it and he holds it I'm closing think with me for a moment he holds it what does that mean he's invested title back in himself he holds it so we find him sitting on the throne they begin to make it advertisement for a redeemer we'll get into some of that little Lord willing coming up at another time but he's sitting there on the throne John begins to weep but now with the benefit of hindsight we can look at the one who holds the book and we can see that even at that time it was redeemable because like I said if there's a forfeiture of title and you can't find the redeemable the original order you've got a problem but the original owner was not absent I'm playing the drum that's what I'm preaching the original owner was not what's not absent he didn't move off to another city go start another planet somewhere but he said on the throne what does that mean he had still had the power still had the authority even though Satan tried to claim it even though he tried to take it let me tell you church or buried people will never moved beyond this into redemption they've never moved until the land could open that book in their own lives and take it and make it a part of their own lives and they could beat it up they've never moved but yet he's still in that still in that condition it's still in the hands of the original owner let me tell you that what that means is that that title could never go so far that it could not be redeemed because when it goes back as far as it can go it just goes back into the hands of the original owner I hope you with me this has given me way too much time to study and there was a time and there was a moment with a joke when I was in his hands not not yet tasted redemption I'd not yet seen the opening of the word I'm not yet become a part of my life but I was still in his hands even though he sit there on the throne cried out for a redeemer it was still even though I didn't know anything about it it was still on the throne and if you can see it listen John saw it on the throne he saw the book in the hands of him that sat on the throne when he saw it he began to weep and when he's began to weep because of that closed book in the hands of him that sat on the throne they said don't weave John what was that he began to weep he began to repent he began to cry out to God because he knew the title would be lost completely he began to sense he began to get the sense of total failure begin to get the sense of how awful this was a church and that's the place we have to come to sometimes when John saw it in the hands he wept when we see it in the hands of God it brings repentance there are many more pages I thank God for that we've only went through the first two pages the original grant the forfeiture but it's back in the hands of him and I know these things are in the past but I'm preaching it as if it's present because they're our people but that's all they see God sitting on the throne but if you can see that much remember you won't lose you sometimes you have to get to a point where you're just completely sure that you're gonna be lost and then get a vision of him sitting on the throne if there's one thing we don't see today it's that repentance remember what he said repent and be baptized and you should receive the abstract the guarantees repent and be baptized and it'll be a finished work you've got to repent why do you have to repent you've got to be able to see that he is in control you've got to be able to see that the book is in his hands and he's able to do with it what he will as we view the book in the hands of God we know Redemption it's possible somehow I don't do it I don't know understand how I don't know how but somehow he'll do it for our children sometimes we look and we see they've not come to a lamb they don't know they don't obey the Word of God they don't come to the house of God for maybe for people that you know you know that maybe once they serve God they don't serve God anymore and it seems as if just that book is closed and it seems as if it's back benefits in the hands of the original owner all those that are hairs will come to him so we don't have to be afraid today we don't have to be frightened as if we'll be lost but we can say because I see it in the hands of the original owner and I went beyond that I've seen the lamb come and I've seen him take the book and I've seen him actually come down and I've seen the book opened and handed to me and I hate it and when I did hate it I eat it I felt the effects of it and when I did that all the sudden I realized that when it was in his hands I was in his hands you don't have to worry but you do after a bed rest in his hands bow our heads together I just stopped there I started to I started to add more scriptures and try to complete it and take it farther and I just felt the unction of the Holy Spirit to stop he has it in his hands maybe that's where you're at today maybe sitting here I don't know maybe watching I know we're a small church but maybe to you it's just never really been opened the way that it should could you just see him sitting there today seems sitting on the throne recognize that you can be redeemed don't fall into the pit of Satan we said well it's okay you can just do what you want to don't fall into the Hat don't let the serpent give you legal advice well I could just do what I want I'll just go to church and I'll be fine but no you got to be saved you got to be born again you have to repent before you can receive the abstract if we feel his presence here today if you just in that situation maybe at times you feel like you've lost your vision of the redemption that's taking place in our hour the redemption that took place on the cross the finished work if you've lost that vision of that you can just see him on his throne today you can begin to see he is a redeemer you will not lose those things that are his it takes faith to believe God and to repent you'll never repent without faith if you can't believe things that seem impossible to believe you'll never repent but if you can believe and just say Lord I believe somehow I believe the trauma had thrown I don't know exactly I can't give it the incidence but I believe you're on that throne today I may have failed I may not all kinds of things but you're still on the throne and now I have an intercession I have a lamb interceding for me now I have one who can take the book and who can provide it as an open book in my name Heavenly Father if there's one listening for myself lord help me Lord so many times as a Christian we want to see that open book we want to see the lamb and that's wonderful we have to see that but we first must see that it's in your hands but if we've done something that's wrong lord help us to repent quickly help us not to wait for hours and days and months years help us to repent Lord God if there's something I make mistakes every day I'm so glad for the mediator so glad for the lamb if there wasn't a lamb where would we be but maybe there's someone listening today he's got a loss that sister fellowship Oh God would you just help him to see that you're still on the throne they may not understand everything but there's an open book waiting for them if they're just willing to receive it they'll just repent that's the first step I'm sorry maybe you need to say it to your wife maybe you said to your husband maybe you need to say it to the church maybe you need to say to your brothers and sisters I'm sorry most of all you need to say it to God I'm sorry I see you sitting on the throne I'm sorry I want to be right then turn from your wicked way and walk away from it let God take your life walk away from the things that have torn you down let God begin to move in your life [Music] father I pray you'd granite Lord as I feel that you're speaking directly to us today to me into each one here each one that's watching

adulterer thank God God I want to see you in control of my life it's in your hands Lord I want to see you as a redeemer we'll get into coming up [Music] or sweep all for my soul sweep over my soul or
