[0:00] might get happy somebody else might be
[0:01] full of Faith yeah right brother brandom
[0:05] taught us that that we are atmosphere
[0:08] controllers yes we cre we're creators of
[0:12] atmosphere right we create and control
[0:15] the atmosphere around us let's have the
[0:17] right one amen as much as is in our
[0:19] power to do that and yet I acknowledge
[0:22] and I understand what it's like CU I do
[0:24] it many times myself you can be
[0:26] heartbroken and
[0:28] hurt and and feel like nothing's going
[0:31] right and you still
[0:32] play and I'm thankful for
[0:35] that you take your position you still
[0:38] you're still a deacon and you still
[0:40] greet the people at the door you're
[0:41] still a trustee and you still do the
[0:42] work you're supposed to do and you don't
[0:44] feel like doing it and and preaching is
[0:45] the same way many times you don't feel
[0:47] like it but you rebuke your flesh and
[0:48] drag your flesh forward and and you do
[0:51] it like brother Ben talked about last
[0:52] week you do it anyway why do you do it
[0:54] because you know it's not about you it's
[0:56] about something higher than that it's
[0:58] about something bigger than that and so
[1:00] you go when you're hurting when you're
[1:02] when you when you're discouraged and
[1:03] everything else and you still work and
[1:05] do your part to fill your place and and
[1:07] encourage the people of God and I say
[1:09] thank you for doing that there's a great
[1:11] reward laid up for that sir brother Joel
[1:14] I may not get through this this morning
[1:15] but we'll do our
[1:17] best
[1:18] now we can have confidence that the way
[1:21] a prophet set up his church is the way
[1:24] that Paul would have done it if he lived
[1:27] in this
[1:28] age you can try to talk me out of that
[1:30] but you're going to have a hard time
[1:32] yeah now I know that there's some things
[1:34] that's the sovereignty of the local
[1:35] church you just where you live uh what
[1:38] you're doing we don't have a bell to
[1:39] ring right on Sunday morning to bring
[1:42] the people kids from Sunday school
[1:43] there's some things it's sovereignty of
[1:44] a local church just your your position
[1:47] but on the big things on I would say the
[1:50] the important things the things that are
[1:52] scriptural brother Brandon brought those
[1:53] to church order and brought those
[1:55] through the way he set up his church and
[1:58] I believe if if he did it that way way
[2:00] far be it from me to change that I don't
[2:03] have the authority to change that people
[2:05] have asked me and challenged me why do
[2:06] you preach on Sunday morning instead of
[2:08] playing a tape I'd love to be able to
[2:10] just pray play a tape but a prophet told
[2:12] me how to have
[2:13] church right right and far be it for me
[2:16] to change that and I'm serious about
[2:19] that now I believe it Blends right with
[2:22] the scripture now brother Brandon says
[2:24] this and that's not not that would' be
[2:26] wrong to play a tape if if we felt led
[2:28] to do that but in our regular church
[2:30] services a prophet told us how to have
[2:32] church now brother Bram says this in the
[2:35] Ephesian church he said I want to say
[2:36] that I believe in
[2:37] leadership he said but it's not the
[2:39] leadership of men I believe in I believe
[2:42] in the leadership of the Holy Ghost
[2:43] coming through the word he said I
[2:45] believe also that God has set men in the
[2:47] church men who are gifted by the spirit
[2:50] and they will keep the church in order
[2:52] say God help me to be a part of that yes
[2:54] said I believe that I believe also that
[2:56] the church is ruled over by men that God
[2:58] sends to take charge but that rule is by
[3:01] the word notice it's by the word it's
[3:04] not by personality it's not by gifts
[3:07] it's by the word that rule is by the
[3:10] word he said so that it is not men
[3:12] really ruling but the spirit of God for
[3:15] the word and spirit are one now and
[3:18] brother Bram quotes this Hebrews 13:7
[3:20] remember them which have the rule over
[3:21] you who have spoken unto you what does
[3:24] it say who have spoken unto you the word
[3:26] of God whose Faith follow considering
[3:29] the end of their conversation or their
[3:31] life considering what their end was we
[3:34] all have had preachers and Pastors in
[3:36] the past that maybe have passed on or
[3:38] gotten older you can look back and see
[3:40] how they did it and if if they've been a
[3:41] real minister of the word you can see
[3:44] how their life ended and and how they
[3:46] went to be with the Lord and say I want
[3:47] to be like that and we could look to
[3:49] brother brandom that way we remember he
[3:51] preached to us and we believe what he
[3:53] said yes so and we follow that Faith now
[3:57] we had that prophet in our day we're not
[3:58] looking for one we're not waiting on one
[4:00] he's coming gone yes I want to to
[4:04] highlight this morning the bylaws that
[4:08] brother brandom and they did they did
[4:09] bylaws and they did kind of an
[4:10] explanation of the bylaws what I want to
[4:12] look at this morning at the brandom
[4:14] Tabernacle and I have hung those at the
[4:16] back of the church if you want to look
[4:17] at them put them back up when you're
[4:18] done with them but they're actually back
[4:20] there on the board the actual bylaws but
[4:22] we'll run through some of them this
[4:24] morning as much as we can get through
[4:26] and you say well this is this is crazy
[4:28] well I don't have a other than the Holy
[4:30] Ghost so and you guys I mean if you if
[4:33] you want to vote me out over this sermon
[4:35] go ahead I I can find another job but I
[4:38] think it'll be okay I think we'll make
[4:41] it
[4:42] so uh brother random talks about the uh
[4:45] the the bylaws of the church and and
[4:47] what each office is to do and they wrote
[4:49] that down and and put it in a a document
[4:51] and uh he talks about the pastor and I
[4:54] want to compare this with the scripture
[4:55] he talks about the pastor he said the
[4:57] office of the pastor is to conduct and
[4:59] act upon any program of which he
[5:00] believes to be according to the plan of
[5:02] God according to the word of God for the
[5:04] Bram Tabernacle was his church he shall
[5:06] assume supreme authority meet meet
[5:08] promoting for the spiritual welfare of
[5:10] the church and I haven't changed any
[5:12] words in this it's exactly the way that
[5:14] they did it he said he shall be head of
[5:16] the associate pastor the Deacon board
[5:18] the trustee board and the church body
[5:19] itself acting in wisdom to lead God's
[5:22] Saints manifesting love toward all the
[5:25] saints and their burdens conducting
[5:27] himself in perfect servitude
[5:30] of which God has called and placed him
[5:31] to act upon I don't see anything in
[5:33] there that that enables me to be a
[5:36] dictator right or to overrule the church
[5:39] body right right on something the church
[5:41] body decides but but to there got to be
[5:44] somebody to make day-to-day decisions
[5:47] about the church services and somebody's
[5:49] got to preach so that's what a pastor is
[5:51] now and and he's the head of the body in
[5:54] that way 1 Peter 5 And1 We compare this
[5:56] with the scripture he said the elders
[5:58] which are among you I exhort
[6:00] also an elder and a witness of the
[6:01] sufferings of Christ and also a partaker
[6:04] of the glory that shall be revealed feed
[6:06] the flock of God which is among you
[6:08] that's a challenge God gave me to do
[6:11] feed the flock that that's my that's my
[6:13] mandate from God feed the flock of God
[6:16] which is among you taking the oversight
[6:18] thereof not by constraint so if you
[6:21] don't want to go here to church you
[6:23] don't have to go here to church and if
[6:25] you leave I'm not going to be mad at you
[6:28] right I promise publicly I will not be
[6:30] mad at you for leaving I might be
[6:31] disappointed because I love you but I'm
[6:33] not going to be mad at you right if you
[6:35] leave in the right way I'm I'm not going
[6:37] to be upset at you because I know God
[6:39] didn't call me to Pastor everybody and I
[6:42] cannot Pastor You by
[6:45] constraint I can't Pastor you because I
[6:47] I force you to or make it sound like
[6:49] well if you don't listen to me you're
[6:51] going to go out and have a wreck
[6:51] somewhere you might have a wreck but it
[6:53] won't be because you didn't listen to me
[6:56] right yeah true so I can tell you that
[6:58] right now God's men don't move that way
[7:01] right so you feed the flock of God
[7:03] taking the oversight not by constraint
[7:05] but willingly not for filthy lcer that's
[7:07] money ill gotten gains but of a ready
[7:11] mind I say anybody does this for money
[7:13] is
[7:14] crazy verse three neither is being Lords
[7:17] over God's Heritage but being examples
[7:20] to the flock so he's saying instead of
[7:21] going out there and telling people what
[7:22] to do first be an example of what to do
[7:25] and then you can tell them what to do
[7:27] but don't first be an example
[7:30] right you got to preach you got to tell
[7:32] people the truth but first be an example
[7:33] I say God help me to do that and you
[7:36] understand I'm human and you're human
[7:37] and we'll get along somehow in that but
[7:39] this is the
[7:41] goal and there's qualifications for a
[7:44] preacher 1 Timothy 31 for a pastor
[7:46] specifically he said this is the truth
[7:48] saying if a man desire the office of a
[7:50] bishop and a bishop simply means
[7:51] overseer brother brand said Bishop is
[7:53] the office and Elder is the man so
[7:56] Bishop is the office of Elder he said
[7:58] this is the true saying of if a man
[7:59] desire the office of a bishop he
[8:01] desireth a good work a bishop then must
[8:03] be blameless I I'll say that let me stop
[8:05] there for a minute if you're going to be
[8:06] a pastor you have to want to be on some
[8:08] level right but but you also can't be a
[8:11] guy that that's your only goal in life
[8:13] and and that's all it's about well I'm
[8:15] going to be a pastor I'm going to be an
[8:16] evangelist you got to be somebody that
[8:18] will serve God and somebody willing to
[8:20] do what God calls you to do and what the
[8:22] people want you to do if you're going to
[8:24] be a preacher you just you're just going
[8:25] to have to have find somebody to let you
[8:26] preach right so and and if nobody wants
[8:29] to listen to you sit down and enjoy
[8:33] that right so excuse me for being blunt
[8:36] this morning but sometimes I have to be
[8:38] so a he says he desires a good work a
[8:42] bishop then must be blameless he must be
[8:44] blameless uh in other words there can't
[8:46] be something that's true about him it's
[8:48] not that no one would ever blame him for
[8:50] anything but it can't be something
[8:51] that's true about him that would that
[8:53] would keep him out of that office he
[8:55] can't be somebody live not living it not
[8:57] living the gospel he's got to be the
[8:58] husband usband of one
[9:00] wife you interpret it however you want
[9:02] to but that's I'll interpret it the way
[9:04] brother brandham did he can't be double
[9:05] married husband of one wife Vigilant
[9:09] that's watchful The Watchman over the
[9:11] flock sober means he can't be
[9:14] flighty of good behavior all right so
[9:18] there's more than just not being double
[9:19] married given to hospitality if we've
[9:23] never seen the inside of a home you
[9:24] probably wouldn't make a good pastor if
[9:27] no one's ever seen the inside of your
[9:28] home right you got to be given to
[9:30] hospitality apt to
[9:33] teach right so a pastor has to be able
[9:35] to teach it's a requirement 1 Timothy
[9:38] 3:3 not given to wine that's that's a
[9:41] given right not given to Wine no Striker
[9:44] now there's an interesting word that
[9:45] word Striker is not uh is not uh some I
[9:49] thought all my life I thought that was a
[9:51] different kind of wine but that's not
[9:52] what that is it means not a
[9:54] bully not a bully God help me never to
[9:57] be a bully
[9:59] right you can be a bully with
[10:03] truth not a bully he said not a brawler
[10:07] or not no Striker not greedy of filthy
[10:09] ler again money but
[10:11] patient patient wait on the Lord not
[10:15] wait on the people not not a brawler in
[10:17] other words not somebody going out
[10:19] causes fights all the
[10:21] time not Covetous not somebody wants
[10:23] what somebody else has verse four one
[10:26] that ruleth well his own house having
[10:28] his children
[10:29] oh where's my children this morning in
[10:32] subjection with all gravity for if a man
[10:34] know not how to rule his own house how
[10:36] shall he take care of the Church of God
[10:39] not a novice other words he's got to be
[10:41] has to be doing it for a while before he
[10:42] becomes a pastor has to be working being
[10:45] a he has to have been a minister for a
[10:47] while you can't just take him off the
[10:48] bar stool and put him right in the pull
[10:49] pit become a pastor L being lifted up
[10:53] with pride he fall into condemnation of
[10:54] the devil verse seven moreover he must
[10:57] have a good report of them he must must
[10:59] have a good report of them which are
[11:01] without that means people are not
[11:04] Believers right that's I hope I'm not
[11:08] boring you this morning you said brother
[11:09] Ben that's not my qualification but it'd
[11:11] be a good thing if we were all like
[11:15] this and so you got to have a good
[11:17] report of them which are The Outsiders
[11:18] because if he doesn't have a good report
[11:19] in the community he's never going to be
[11:21] able to Pastor in that community and it
[11:23] reveals something about his character
[11:26] lest he fall into reproach and the snare
[11:27] of the Devil look how brother the
[11:29] treated the office of Pastor he says
[11:31] this he says stay with your pastor see
[11:33] he's the shepherd you give him respects
[11:35] he'll lead you through because he's
[11:36] ordained of God to do so again he said
[11:38] and is your life worthy of the Gospel
[11:40] speaking of brother Neville the pastor
[11:41] there at Jeffersonville uh he said I
[11:43] turn he said this Pulpit over to a man
[11:46] that I have the Supreme confidence in as
[11:49] a servant of Jesus Christ our pastor
[11:51] brother Neville well that just took my
[11:53] breath away when I read that I thought
[11:55] for a for a prophet what confidence that
[11:57] must have given to brother Neville hear
[11:59] him say that I think we need to say good
[12:00] things about one another and so he said
[12:03] that about brother Neville there's
[12:05] actually more information in the Bible
[12:06] about the associate pastor and so the
[12:08] office of the associate pastor uh he
[12:11] said the associate pastor is to perform
[12:12] and carry out the duties of the pastor
[12:14] and his absence to conduct worship
[12:16] Services according to the manner of
[12:17] Doctrine believed and practiced by the
[12:19] brandom Tabernacle he shall be invested
[12:20] with the same power as the pastor is
[12:22] meeing all responsibility of the church
[12:24] acting in full authority to keep the
[12:26] church in order he is to manifest deep
[12:28] concern all the burdens of the Saints
[12:30] and fulfill the commission of which God
[12:32] has called him to as a shepherd He Shall
[12:34] account at various times the progress of
[12:35] the church spiritual matters present and
[12:37] problems may be pressing to the pastor
[12:40] only the pressing problems
[12:42] though he shall not he shall not
[12:45] undertake any business transactions
[12:47] without first presenting it to the
[12:48] pastor the exact transaction that just
[12:51] makes sense you say what where's there
[12:52] an associate pastor in the scripture
[12:54] they always went out two by
[12:57] two and in fact Mark 6:7 he said he
[12:59] called to him the 12 begin to send them
[13:01] forth by two and two and gave them power
[13:03] over unclean spirits in 2 Corinthians
[13:05] 1:1 Paul and Apostle Jesus Christ by the
[13:07] will of God and Timothy our brother you
[13:10] say well those Epistles were written by
[13:12] Paul but several of the Epistles have
[13:13] another name attached to him Timothy or
[13:16] Titus or some other brother there's a
[13:18] reason for that Paul always included his
[13:21] associates with him and what he was
[13:23] doing and that's what we're trying to do
[13:25] here all of our all of the brothers that
[13:27] preacher our Associates
[13:29] with me in that way so Paul was the
[13:32] pastor at Ephesus Timothy was the
[13:33] associate Paul was also an apostle he
[13:36] had to be gone a lot the way brother
[13:37] brandham had to be gone and brother
[13:38] Neville worked with him in that way uh
[13:41] there's an office of trustees and
[13:43] brother brandham and I'll just kind of
[13:44] skip through this but again you can read
[13:46] it trustees are elected to protect the
[13:48] church and its financial matters it
[13:50] business investment supervision of its
[13:52] properties its expenditures they shall
[13:55] strongly consider I want to point that
[13:57] out strongly consider every move of
[13:59] progress step by step which involves
[14:01] Church funds they are responsible to
[14:04] keep the church from indebtedness we are
[14:06] debt free today and the trustees are
[14:09] responsible for that I say praise the
[14:12] Lord and the Saints from burdens that
[14:14] are too great to Bear financially in the
[14:16] undertaking of any project he said they
[14:18] to bring the matter to the pastor
[14:19] consultation by the pastor and
[14:21] consultation by the pastor only for
[14:22] every Financial project the church
[14:23] wishes to invest or engage itself
[14:25] therein is absolutely required so
[14:27] they've got to consult with the pastor
[14:29] for they do anything but they have the
[14:30] authority to do things now trustees
[14:32] that's a modern necessity not a Biblical
[14:34] office but there is a place in the
[14:36] scripture where men were given money and
[14:38] were responsible for it 1 Corinthians
[14:41] 16 he had a collection for the Saints
[14:43] verse one give an order to the churches
[14:45] of galatia verse two he said upon the
[14:47] first day of the week that's when they
[14:48] had church that's why we have church on
[14:50] Sunday he said on the first day of the
[14:52] week let every one of you lay by him in
[14:53] store as God has prospered him to be no
[14:55] Gatherings when I come he said I don't
[14:57] want you to take an offering when I come
[14:58] just take one on Sunday morning and then
[15:01] a special offering for these people he
[15:03] said when I come whomsoever you shall
[15:05] approve by your letters then will I send
[15:07] to bring your liberality into Jerusalem
[15:09] so he's saying he's saying you can
[15:11] appoint men you trust to handle the
[15:13] money right that's what trustees are and
[15:16] also the
[15:18] treasur the deacons the deacons are uh
[15:21] Office of the deacons is elected
[15:22] according to the word of God is to act
[15:24] in office of spiritual assistance to the
[15:26] pastors they're to assist the pastors on
[15:28] all of his spiritual activities they're
[15:31] given free speech and presenting to the
[15:32] pastors any program or benefits that
[15:34] would bless the general and spiritual
[15:36] Weare of the church they must be apt to
[15:39] teach that's biblical we read we we'll
[15:41] read that in just a moment ready to
[15:42] assist a pastor associate pastor on
[15:44] every duty of called to do so they shall
[15:46] assist in serving commu communion be
[15:48] acting ushers in all services they shall
[15:51] police the church they'll uh keep civil
[15:53] order assist in taking local offerings
[15:55] oversee the spiritual conduct of the
[15:57] church and working with with the pastor
[15:59] and one another on spiritual problems
[16:00] and matters of the Saints and they shall
[16:02] be ready at any time to assist the need
[16:04] of every saint who is burdened and in
[16:06] need of spiritual consultation or
[16:08] general welfare so if you have a need
[16:11] and I've told you that before and I know
[16:12] we don't want to bother people but if
[16:14] say like we had this Ice event that we
[16:16] had and maybe you can't get out and you
[16:17] need groceries call me or call a deacon
[16:20] we have a responsibility to do that to
[16:23] help you if we can in that and that's
[16:25] why we want to have enough deacons to be
[16:27] able to do those things and and deacons
[16:29] from different areas that are able to
[16:30] help you where you where you live
[16:32] because I know we're spread out now uh
[16:34] they they uh don't have a right to act
[16:36] on anything that costs money without uh
[16:38] Consulting the pastor or the trustees
[16:41] and they'll be responsible before God
[16:42] for their conduct and manner of service
[16:44] according to the word of God they're not
[16:46] to have meetings among themselves
[16:47] without the pastor or associate pastor
[16:49] present the Bible says this about
[16:51] deacons deacons he said likewise must
[16:53] the deacons be grave and that's
[16:55] something I wanted to point out this
[16:56] morning how many know what grave means
[16:58] there
[16:59] there grave means worthy of
[17:03] respect worthy of respect I'm glad we
[17:06] have deacons that are worthy of respect
[17:08] there have to be men who are worthy of
[17:10] respect and that I believe that includes
[17:13] dress deportment
[17:14] timeliness and everything else that goes
[17:17] with that men that are worthy of respect
[17:21] so that's what a deacon is and they're
[17:23] not giv to much wine not double tongue
[17:25] that means not telling one person one
[17:26] thing and one person another but telling
[17:28] the truth not greedy of filthy lucer not
[17:31] greedy of money holding the mystery of
[17:33] the faith in a pure conscience and
[17:34] brother brandom explained that this way
[17:36] they have to believe the doctrine of the
[17:38] church if they disagree on something
[17:40] maybe they disagree on something little
[17:41] they can keep quiet about that if they
[17:43] if they disagree publicly about the
[17:45] doctrine of the church they need to
[17:46] resign their
[17:47] office right because we have to be able
[17:49] to work together right that just we we
[17:52] we must be able to work together we've
[17:53] got to there's a dying world out there
[17:55] we got a church to take care of we we're
[17:58] required to do a good job how many
[18:00] believe that
[18:01] today so brother brandom said put your
[18:04] very best man you can on your
[18:07] board and and and that's what my first
[18:09] when I'm looking for somebody or the
[18:11] brothers are recommending somebody we're
[18:13] looking for a good man
[18:15] first that's what we're looking for good
[18:17] men and men that approved themselves
[18:19] here in the church and we're looking for
[18:21] that and that's not to say if you don't
[18:22] have an office you're not a good man
[18:23] because there a lot of other
[18:24] qualifications too but that's the first
[18:26] one right and so you got to test that
[18:28] man brother brandom said test that man
[18:30] that's why we have a time period before
[18:31] a man becomes a full Deacon test that
[18:34] man first the Deacon's got more
[18:35] responsibility he said than the pastor
[18:36] has heed to be blameless the Deacon is
[18:39] and so there there's a proving period he
[18:41] said first they must be appointed and
[18:43] see how they like it how the
[18:44] congregation likes it he said then if
[18:46] it's all right on both sides and we make
[18:47] these men ordained deacons he said just
[18:49] like trustees are elected the same way
[18:52] First Timothy 3:11 says even so must
[18:54] their wives be grave in other words
[18:56] their wives must be worthy of respect
[18:59] not not slanderer sober faithful in all
[19:01] things he said let the deacons be the
[19:03] husbands of one wife same thing as a
[19:05] pastor applies to the deacons not to the
[19:07] trustees but to the deacons he said
[19:10] ruling their children in their own hous
[19:12] as well for they that have used the
[19:13] office of a deacon he said well now
[19:15] listen to this this is a promise to you
[19:17] that you that have been a deacon for
[19:19] years however many years that's been has
[19:21] it been more than 50 Years brother Danny
[19:23] probably close to 50 years my goodness
[19:27] listen to this scripture they that have
[19:30] used the office of a deacon well
[19:33] purchased to themselves a good degree
[19:36] that what that means is a good standing
[19:38] with God and with man great boldness in
[19:41] the faith which is in Christ Jesus I I
[19:45] tell you what my hats off to those men
[19:46] that have stood there and used the
[19:48] office of a deacon well uh we we don't
[19:51] have time to go through every one of
[19:52] these offices but he talks about the
[19:54] office of a Treasurer what his
[19:56] authorities are he talks about the
[19:58] office of the Sunday School
[19:59] Superintendent ours isn't here this
[20:01] morning got called away but what his uh
[20:04] importance is he said it's a vital
[20:05] importance to the church vital
[20:08] importance because somebody's got to
[20:09] make sure that goes smoothly and I'll
[20:11] say this lately I have not had to even
[20:13] think about what happens in the Sunday
[20:15] school and I think our teachers for that
[20:17] and our Sunday school superintendent
[20:18] they've just been right on top of it and
[20:20] thank you for doing that so and we've
[20:23] got others that can fill in if we ever
[20:24] need them in that as well and so there's
[20:27] that and
[20:28] uh it's a necessary office he talks
[20:31] about the office of music program he
[20:33] talks about that as an office he talks
[20:35] about how the pastor should be should be
[20:37] in control of that and I'll say this I
[20:39] delegate that to to our worship leaders
[20:41] most of it but still the final say and
[20:44] what happens in the music if you don't
[20:46] like the music blame
[20:49] me because I'm ultimately responsible
[20:51] for the
[20:52] music so but it is a Biblical office you
[20:55] know music's a Biblical office yes first
[20:58] Chronicles 16:4 are you still with me
[21:00] this morning just got a few more minutes
[21:02] and we'll close I'm not going to drag it
[21:03] out brother Ben beard sends his
[21:05] apologies for last week he was reading
[21:07] the clock
[21:09] wrong he really did call me and tell me
[21:12] that so I'm just passing the word along
[21:15] wasn't that good last week we enjoyed
[21:17] that so the music program is a Biblical
[21:21] office he said he appointed certain of
[21:22] the Levites to minister before the Ark
[21:24] of the Lord and to record and to thank
[21:26] and praise the Lord God of Israel
[21:28] appointed certain ones to do that he
[21:31] talked about Asaf and and all the
[21:32] different names that did that he said
[21:34] but Asaf the song leader made a sound
[21:36] with symbols you had a worship leader
[21:38] who was also a
[21:40] drummer he said Ben I also boy that that
[21:43] caused some problems in some Churches
[21:45] wouldn't it benah also and jesil the
[21:48] priest with trumpets with trumpets a
[21:50] brass band I love this
[21:55] continually continually whenever the
[21:57] word was there music was there yeah
[22:00] before the Ark of the Lord Ark of the
[22:02] Covenant of God and and and this drum
[22:05] playing worship leader David tells him
[22:07] in Psalms 33:3 sing unto him a new song
[22:09] sir play skillfully with a loud noise
[22:13] amen Colossians 3:16 let the word of
[22:16] Christ and it can be too loud I I agree
[22:19] with that but it does need to be loud
[22:21] enough to hear yeah it can be too loud
[22:23] I'll say this let's work together each
[22:26] one of us individually can be too loud
[22:29] but let's work together let's let's be
[22:31] together as a group how is what I'm
[22:33] doing and I mean loud not just in voice
[22:35] but in every way Le let's work let's
[22:37] make sure we blend in with the church
[22:40] and that doesn't lessen who we are it
[22:41] strengthens who the church is so what we
[22:44] do if it's good for the church we'll do
[22:46] it if it's not good for the church we
[22:48] don't have to do it right because we
[22:50] want to do what's right for God and for
[22:52] the church and so Paul says it this way
[22:55] in the New Testament let the word of
[22:56] Christ dwell in you
[22:58] richly in all wisdom yes you you realize
[23:01] the word lives in you in song cuz a lot
[23:05] of times you'll remember a song when you
[23:06] won't remember a
[23:08] scripture this morning I had a song ran
[23:10] through my head probably you haven't
[23:11] heard in a long time I heard it recently
[23:13] and it it struck my uh it struck my uh
[23:16] it it struck in my heart Let the church
[23:18] be the church remember that song old
[23:20] Bill Gater song very few of my mother
[23:22] remembers it praise God let the church
[23:25] be the church let the people Rejoice
[23:27] yeah a great lyric a great line it that
[23:29] word just stuck in my heart Let the
[23:31] church be the
[23:32] church and it says I've settled the
[23:35] question I've made my
[23:36] choice that a great line we sang that
[23:38] song this morning I pledge allegiance to
[23:41] the lamb and that strikes my heart
[23:43] sometimes I want to stand here and
[23:45] pledge allegiance to the Lamb of God
[23:47] come on yes you think about the song he
[23:50] looked beyond my fault and saw my need
[23:53] yes that's amazing isn't it yeah I've
[23:55] always loved the the lyric to the love
[23:57] of God they say say the I think the
[23:58] second verse of that was written on the
[23:59] wall of an insane asylum and and but it
[24:02] but it's so true he said the love of God
[24:05] is greater far than tongue or pin can
[24:06] ever tell it reaches to the brightest
[24:09] star and and to the lowest hell amen and
[24:12] just the lyric of that is so great yeah
[24:14] it goes beyond the highest star and and
[24:17] the the lyric I believe the verse that
[24:18] was written there was was could we with
[24:20] ink the ocean F and drain the oceans
[24:22] dry and where every stalk on earth a
[24:25] quill and every man ascribed by trade if
[24:28] we could think about the words of that
[24:31] if we could if we could drain all of
[24:33] that it still wouldn't equal the love of
[24:35] God to write the love of God above would
[24:37] drain the oceans dry yeah nor could the
[24:39] scroll contain the whole they'll stretch
[24:41] from Sky to Sky yeah yeah I told my kids
[24:45] this week I didn't mean to get off on
[24:47] this but I told my kids this week the
[24:49] story of Amazing
[24:51] Grace written by a man who become a
[24:54] slave to Slaves John Newton become a
[24:58] slave to
[25:00] slaves and he was so he had gotten so
[25:02] far down he's raised in church but he
[25:04] got so far away as a little boy going
[25:06] off on the on the ships as a sailor he
[25:09] did everything you can imagine that
[25:11] could be done in fact I'd say his life
[25:13] story is almost you couldn't read it if
[25:15] you were a child you'd have to be an
[25:17] adult to read it because it's so brutal
[25:21] and and he did so many bad things but he
[25:24] got saved one day cuz he'd been taught
[25:27] things as a child it's important what
[25:29] you Sunday school teachers are
[25:30] teaching
[25:32] right my uh daughter come home last week
[25:35] sister Patty and and she told me all
[25:37] about the white judgment now I assume
[25:38] she meant the white Throne
[25:41] judgment but uh she did and I was proud
[25:43] of that you know that she knew that and
[25:46] uh but she was telling me all about it
[25:47] she said you go to the white judgment
[25:48] and then you're judge I said well that
[25:50] sounds
[25:52] good but she was telling me all about
[25:54] the order of you know if you die you go
[25:56] to paradise and all this stuff and I'm
[25:57] thinking that I'm glad they're being
[25:59] taught because John John Newton
[26:00] remembered what he been taught as a
[26:01] child this going out on me again John
[26:04] Newton remembered what he was taught as
[26:06] a child and when he remembered it when
[26:08] he remembered it he was in a storm and
[26:11] in the middle of that storm he gave his
[26:12] life to Christ he had many ups and downs
[26:14] after that one day become a minister
[26:17] become a preacher become a pastor of a
[26:18] church and he began to write that song
[26:20] Amazing Grace how sweet the sound that
[26:22] saved a Wretch like Me I once was lost
[26:25] but now I'm found was blind but now I
[26:28] see yes oh my who could write that but a
[26:30] sinner but I've been a sinner yeah and
[26:33] that word dwells in US richly yes it
[26:36] dwells in us so I'm so glad for the
[26:38] songs of the church he said let the word
[26:39] of Christ dwell in you richly in all
[26:41] wisdom teaching and admonishing one
[26:43] another in Psalms and hymns and
[26:46] spiritual songs singing with Grace in
[26:48] your hearts to the Lord I said lift up
[26:49] your voice and
[26:51] sing sing together uh learn to be the
[26:54] choir amen I've said before and we'll
[26:56] have a choir at some point I'm sure but
[26:59] but I I love to have a choir but I love
[27:01] for you to be the choir Let the church
[27:03] be the
[27:05] church let the people Rejoice yes who's
[27:09] the head of the church Christ is the
[27:11] head of the
[27:12] church and he is the word he's the head
[27:15] of the body of the church was the
[27:17] beginning the firstborn from the dead
[27:19] that in all things someone say all
[27:21] things you might have the
[27:24] preeminence I want you to understand
[27:26] this morning you voted you say well
[27:27] that's not a spiritual act yes it
[27:30] is brother brand said there's nothing
[27:32] higher in the Bible in the church in the
[27:33] Elder of that church he said it's a
[27:35] sovereign
[27:36] Church what he means by that there's
[27:38] nobody up above a bishop telling him
[27:40] what to do and the Holy Spirit Works in
[27:43] any way he wants to yes he dwells among
[27:46] his people yeah now look I'm going to
[27:50] tie this all the way back to the
[27:51] beginning this Revelation that you have
[27:52] this rock that we're built on what is
[27:56] that is the revelation of who he is
[27:59] today yes yes who Christ is in our day
[28:05] yeah we realize brother brandom taught
[28:07] us you can go back and find the vote of
[28:10] the entire body of the church is the
[28:11] will of the Holy Spirit yes for the
[28:15] church you know that I think I got this
[28:18] this quote on there brother bramman said
[28:20] if one side wants to do this and the
[28:22] other side wants to do that and the side
[28:25] wins the losing decide what did they do
[28:29] about it now think about it what would
[28:31] you do about it if there was a major
[28:33] Church decision and it split right down
[28:35] the middle and it was 51 to 50 or
[28:37] whatever the vote might be and you lost
[28:40] what do you do about it go start another
[28:43] church look what he says what do they do
[28:45] about it join right in with the rest of
[28:47] them say we were wrong then we'll go
[28:51] right on because the Holy Ghost has made
[28:54] that
[28:55] choice now you you said where does
[28:57] brother brandom get that he gets that
[28:58] from acts one remember when they were
[29:01] gathered in the upper room they didn't
[29:02] just wait how many knows that they had a
[29:04] business meeting yeah they had a
[29:07] business meeting they got Maas to come
[29:09] out and take the place remember of Judas
[29:13] now brother Brandon said that was the it
[29:14] wasn't God's choice God's choice was
[29:16] Paul but somebody had to fill that spot
[29:18] till Paul Come Along Mias never did
[29:21] anything that we can tell in the
[29:22] scripture never did anything as an
[29:24] apostle but somebody had to be there and
[29:27] that role somebody's got to do it and so
[29:30] we don't let the perfect be the enemy of
[29:32] the good they had a vote they cast lot
[29:35] with the BR said that was their form of
[29:36] voting they had a vote and when they did
[29:38] the fire fell
[29:41] yes think about it yeah chapter one they
[29:44] they have a vote they get the church in
[29:45] order chapter two they begin to stagger
[29:47] out like drunk men yeah you said this
[29:50] stuff isn't important it is important
[29:52] it's more important than you think yes
[29:55] Matthew 16:18 again that th art Peter
[29:57] Upon This Rock I will build my church in
[29:59] the Gates of Hell will not Prevail
[30:00] against it as musicians come this
[30:02] morning random said that's that divine
[30:04] revelation of the word made flesh think
[30:08] about it for a minute it's not just any
[30:10] revelation of this you say revelation of
[30:12] serpent seed revelation of one God but
[30:14] he said a revelation of the word made
[30:16] flesh he said if it was flesh in that
[30:19] day by the son the groom it's the flesh
[30:22] today by what what did he say by the
[30:26] bride so a revelation that the church
[30:29] can stand on is a revelation that tells
[30:31] us who he he is today who is he today
[30:35] he's Danny Ward yeah he's Joel puit he's
[30:39] every one of you he's Luella Andrews who
[30:41] is he today yeah he's
[30:43] us he is the body you say that's hard
[30:46] for me to take if you have been baptized
[30:48] by the Holy Ghost you've been sealed
[30:49] Away by the token by the true baptism of
[30:52] the Holy Ghost you are in him you are
[30:54] sealed in him you're a part of him and
[30:57] you have to have a revelation of who you
[30:59] are and who the people around you are
[31:01] and if you ever get that Revelation look
[31:03] what he said it'll be he said he knows
[31:06] that if the people get the true
[31:08] revelation of the true church now I've
[31:12] always taken this individually but it's
[31:14] not what he said he didn't say if they
[31:16] get the true revelation of who they are
[31:18] yeah he said if they get the revelation
[31:20] of the church yeah who we are as a body
[31:24] yeah oh God if we can only get a
[31:26] revelation of who we are as a body what
[31:28] happens when we come together what we're
[31:30] a part of not just this little church
[31:32] but churches all around the world if you
[31:35] get a revelation of the true church and
[31:37] what she is what she stands for and that
[31:39] she can do the Greater Works she will be
[31:42] what an invincible Army the Gates of
[31:45] Hell will not Prevail against this
