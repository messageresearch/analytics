[36:43] you just keep me from saying anything
[36:46] that would be wrong Lord may I may only
[36:49] say those things that would be according
[36:51] to your word Lord and I pray for the
[36:53] people today they would receive it in
[36:55] that manner Lord those that may watch or
[36:58] or somehow get a hold of this I pray God
[37:00] that you'd make the word clear to them
[37:03] Lord not the words of a man that's your
[37:05] words which has such value in our lives
[37:07] I thank you for that I pray that you'd
[37:09] heal every sick person touch every heart
[37:11] we pray and we ask you in the precious
[37:13] name of Jesus
[37:17] bless you this evening thank you for
[37:19] coming out to the house of the Lord
[37:21] Deuteronomy chapter 22 and verse 5.
[37:26] Deuteronomy 22 and 5. my purpose today
[37:30] this afternoon is to answer the question
[37:33] from the word of God we're going to take
[37:35] it strictly from the scriptures this
[37:37] afternoon
[37:38] does God care how I dress
[37:41] does God care how I dress I know some of
[37:43] you have asked that question and maybe
[37:47] you have relatives or friends that don't
[37:50] necessarily believe the way that we do
[37:52] and I want to try to answer that from
[37:54] the scripture today so that you can have
[37:56] ammunition and not to fight with
[37:58] necessarily with the people but actually
[38:01] to defend what you believe the Bible
[38:04] tells us to always have an answer for
[38:06] what we believe and and so that people
[38:08] would understand if they really care
[38:10] about the word of God that they would
[38:12] understand about why we do what we do
[38:16] Deuteronomy 22 and 5 I'll say this
[38:19] ultimately it has to come from the heart
[38:21] and so all of these things it has to be
[38:24] a revelation to you from your heart for
[38:27] you to be able to follow it Deuteronomy
[38:29] 22 5 the woman shall not wear that which
[38:31] pertaineth unto a man
[38:33] neither shall a man put on a woman's
[38:35] garment for all that do so are
[38:38] Abomination unto the Lord thy God I pray
[38:41] the Lord with that is blessing to the
[38:43] word you may be seated this evening
[38:46] yeah
[38:47] I would say first of all the answer to
[38:49] the question does God care how I dress
[38:52] is yes
[38:53] He does care how I dress
[38:56] and the reason I know that is he
[38:58] expressed that to me in the word of God
[39:01] now if you do not believe that the Bible
[39:04] is the word of God then we have very
[39:06] little to discuss because the Bible has
[39:09] to be our ultimate it has to be our
[39:11] absolute and we live in an age when that
[39:14] is not the case but look at at what uh
[39:17] what happens when the scriptures are no
[39:20] longer the absolute we can even look at
[39:21] our nation and see the degradation of it
[39:24] and see what's happened because the
[39:26] scriptures are no longer the absolute
[39:28] for the nation and and we can look at
[39:30] other nations and see if you look at
[39:33] Russia at the turn of the last century
[39:35] they made a conscious decision to
[39:37] actually turn away from God so we don't
[39:41] want churches anymore we don't want God
[39:43] we uh we don't want anything to do with
[39:45] that we're going to make our own
[39:46] morality our own way of living and it
[39:50] was Alexander Solstice who was in the
[39:53] gulags and wrote the book the gulag
[39:55] archipelago uh and it it's a great book
[39:59] it tells you about communism and and the
[40:02] horrors of that and and as he was uh he
[40:05] was telling about that and he said when
[40:07] he was a child he said he recalled the
[40:09] elders during that time as he had seen
[40:11] this great Communist Revolution come
[40:14] over Russia and the elders were trying
[40:17] to explain to the younger people what
[40:19] had happened what what had caused all
[40:21] the death camps what was it that uh that
[40:24] made the people just become like animals
[40:26] and treat one another in that way and he
[40:29] summed it up this way he said men have
[40:31] forgotten God
[40:33] men have forgotten God and that was the
[40:35] oh that was the ultimate why they ended
[40:38] up the way that they did and so we want
[40:41] to understand today that when God is
[40:44] forgotten that Society goes into Decline
[40:47] and it ends up being a free-for-all
[40:50] people can do whatever they want to do
[40:51] but we do have a standard today we
[40:54] believe that all scripture is given by
[40:57] inspiration of God and is profitable for
[40:59] Doctrine for reproof for correction and
[41:02] for instruction and righteousness
[41:05] uh the world the church today doesn't
[41:07] always believe that I I don't know how
[41:10] many of you know Charles Stanley uh
[41:12] Charles Stanley was a a great preacher
[41:14] he's a Baptist preacher and you can
[41:16] listen to him on the radio or on
[41:18] television uh Charles believed in the
[41:21] inerrancy of the word of God and as a
[41:24] Baptist we disagree on many things in
[41:26] theology but he agreed we did agree that
[41:29] the Bible is the word of God well the
[41:31] Next Generation doesn't necessarily
[41:33] believe that he has a son named Andy
[41:35] Stanley and it's uh been out there it's
[41:38] public knowledge I'm not saying
[41:40] something out telling Tales out of
[41:42] school tonight but Andy is also a pastor
[41:45] in Atlanta in the same city has a mega
[41:47] church
[41:48] and Andy's taking a different view on
[41:50] the Bible and I will say this if you
[41:52] take this view on the Bible then
[41:53] Anything Goes
[41:55] and this is his view of the scripture he
[41:57] said the time has come for us to take a
[41:59] step back onto a more sure-footing he
[42:02] said and I think a firmer foundation and
[42:04] to build our case for our congregations
[42:06] and for this millennial generation on
[42:09] the event of the resurrection and not on
[42:12] the authenticity or the infallibility of
[42:14] a text
[42:15] and the problem with that is you don't
[42:17] know that there was a resurrection
[42:19] unless you believe the Bible is true
[42:23] right we are we the Christian religion
[42:25] is about the resurrection of the death
[42:27] burial and resurrection of Christ but
[42:29] the word is the only way that we even
[42:30] know that that's true
[42:32] and so all things are negotiable if you
[42:35] believe that way
[42:36] with the Bible we believe that all
[42:39] scripture is inspired of God without the
[42:41] Bible we become slaves to our own
[42:43] morality or the lack thereof so we
[42:46] believe again that all scriptures
[42:48] someone say that with me tonight all
[42:50] scripture is given by inspiration of God
[42:52] so we believe that the reveal word of
[42:55] God is our absolute now I there's
[42:57] several objections that people will give
[42:59] you when you begin to talk about does
[43:01] God care how I dress I don't want you
[43:03] young people especially to listen
[43:04] tonight and and pay attention because
[43:06] you'll hear this in school or even if
[43:08] you're not in public school you'll hear
[43:09] this from family members and people
[43:12] that'll say well God doesn't care how I
[43:14] dress because he looks at the heart
[43:17] how many of you have told been told that
[43:20] right many of us have and it's it's true
[43:23] God does look at the heart
[43:26] right you could be a a person who
[43:28] dresses just right everything long
[43:31] dresses long hair and and nothing wrong
[43:34] at all in the way that you dress and you
[43:35] could be a sinner
[43:37] it has nothing to do with whether you're
[43:39] saved or not in that sense
[43:41] because when you're you could be you
[43:44] could be just as much a sinner as the
[43:46] drunkard is if you've never accepted
[43:48] Christ in your heart and believed and
[43:50] been baptized and been filled with the
[43:52] Holy Spirit those things are necessary
[43:53] for salvation dress is something that
[43:56] follows that we want to please the Lord
[43:59] and we want to follow the dictates of
[44:01] his word because it matters his word
[44:03] matters but they take that from first
[44:05] Samuel 16 7. it says but the Lord said
[44:08] unto Samuel look not on his countenance
[44:10] or on the height of his stature because
[44:12] I have refused him for the Lord seeth
[44:15] not as man seeth for man who gets on the
[44:17] outward appearance but the Lord looketh
[44:19] on the heart this is David when he's
[44:20] walking out there a little bitty shrimp
[44:22] of a fellow and and and God is speaking
[44:25] to the prophet Samuel he says don't
[44:26] don't look at at their at their height
[44:29] or their stature Brother David aren't
[44:31] you glad God God doesn't just look at
[44:32] height and I'm so glad God this doesn't
[44:34] take skinny people or God doesn't just
[44:37] take one kind of person but he said he
[44:39] looks at the heart
[44:41] and yet we look at the scripture we know
[44:43] that we are fruit-bearing trees
[44:46] in Matthew 12 35 Jesus said a good man
[44:50] out of the good Treasure of the heart
[44:51] bringeth forth good things how many want
[44:54] to bring forth good things out of your
[44:56] life so a good man out of the good
[44:58] Treasure of the heart brings forth good
[45:00] things and an evil man out of the evil
[45:02] treasure bringeth forth evil things now
[45:05] we must live the word Not Just Hear It
[45:09] the Bible says in James 1 22 but be
[45:11] doers of the word and not here is only
[45:14] deceiving your own selves or if any be a
[45:17] hearer of the word and not a doer he's
[45:18] liking to a man beholding his natural
[45:20] face in a glass
[45:23] for he beholdth himself and goeth his
[45:25] way and straightway forgetth what manner
[45:28] of man he wants
[45:29] but who's so looketh into the perfect
[45:31] law of Liberty and continuous Therian he
[45:35] being not a forgetful hearer but a doer
[45:37] of the word this man shall be blessed in
[45:39] his deed I don't want to just be saved I
[45:42] want to be blessed
[45:43] I want to do what's right and I think it
[45:46] shows if you are saved whether you
[45:48] follow the word
[45:49] so the next thing that people will tell
[45:51] you usually is well God only cared about
[45:53] dress under the law
[45:55] right and and a lot of you probably
[45:57] heard that as well well uh the scripture
[45:59] that we read was in Deuteronomy right
[46:01] that's under Moses law so God doesn't
[46:04] care about that and they'll tell you
[46:05] something like well if you're going to
[46:07] wear a dress if your women wear dresses
[46:09] and your men wear pants and maybe we
[46:12] ought to go back and start sacrificing
[46:13] bulls and goats again and but we realize
[46:16] that the ceremonial aspects of the law
[46:18] were were filled up in Christ they were
[46:21] fulfilled in Christ
[46:23] right but I'll say this you say well I
[46:26] don't have to dress like that well does
[46:28] that mean you can go murder people
[46:30] because the Bible says thou shall not
[46:32] kill thou shall not murder
[46:34] right it says thou shall not steal
[46:35] that's Old Testament
[46:37] does that mean we can go steal steal
[46:39] things from people and it's okay
[46:41] right and people just don't they
[46:44] generally take what fits their idea but
[46:46] but I'll say this that God did care
[46:48] about dress under the law and he
[46:50] continued to care about it in the New
[46:51] Testament
[46:52] and so we have scripture for that now I
[46:55] will say this even if it were true that
[46:57] was only that it was only written in the
[46:59] Old Testament why would that matter
[47:00] because New Testament Christians
[47:02] understand that Christ come to fulfill
[47:04] the law not to destroy it in Matthew 5
[47:07] and 17 he said Thank not that I've come
[47:09] to destroy the law or the prophets I
[47:11] have not come to destroy but to fulfill
[47:13] verily I say unto you till Heaven and
[47:15] Earth pass one shot or one till shall no
[47:18] wise passed them on in other words not
[47:20] even the punctuation will pass from the
[47:22] law till all be fulfilled whosoever
[47:25] therefore shall break one of these least
[47:27] Commandments and shall teach men so he
[47:30] shall be called the least in the Kingdom
[47:31] of Heaven you say well that's the least
[47:33] of The Commandments well he said whoever
[47:35] breaks the least of The Commandments
[47:36] shall be called the least in the Kingdom
[47:38] of Heaven but whosoever shall do and
[47:40] teach the same Shall be Called great in
[47:42] the Kingdom of Heaven for I say unto you
[47:44] that accept your righteousness shall
[47:45] exceed the righteousness of the scribes
[47:47] and Pharisees you shall in no case enter
[47:49] into the kingdom of heaven and I want to
[47:51] enter in don't you
[47:55] so these instructions that we read in
[47:57] our text The man shall not wear pertains
[48:00] to a woman the woman should not wear
[48:01] what pertains to a man that's not based
[48:04] on any ceremony
[48:05] right or any any kind of any kind of
[48:08] something that was fulfilled in Christ
[48:10] but it's based on the god-ordained
