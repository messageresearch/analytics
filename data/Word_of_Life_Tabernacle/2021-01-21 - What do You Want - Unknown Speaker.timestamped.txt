[40:06] so they gathered themselves together at
[40:08] jerusalem in the third
[40:10] month in the 15th year of the reign of
[40:13] asa
[40:14] and they offered unto the lord the same
[40:16] time of the spoil which they had brought
[40:18] 700 oxen and
[40:20] 7 000 sheep and they entered into a
[40:23] covenant to seek the lord god of their
[40:25] fathers
[40:27] with all their heart and with all their
[40:29] soul
[40:31] now they were they were getting serious
[40:33] about this
[40:34] said that whosoever would not seek the
[40:36] lord god of israel should be put to
[40:38] death
[40:39] whether small or great whether man or
[40:41] woman
[40:43] verse 14 they swear unto the lord with a
[40:45] loud voice
[40:46] was shouting with trumpets with cornets
[40:50] they had a pentecostal jubilee
[40:54] and all judah rejoiced at the oath for
[40:57] they had sworn with all their heart
[40:59] and sought him notices with their whole
[41:03] desire he was found of them
[41:07] and the lord gave them rest round about
[41:10] i pray the lord would add his blessing
[41:12] to the word this evening
[41:13] you may be seated
[41:20] waldo emerson was addressing a
[41:21] graduating class at harvard university
[41:24] one time and
[41:25] he said this he said young men be
[41:27] careful what you want
[41:30] for you will surely get it
[41:33] be careful what you want for you will
[41:35] surely
[41:36] get it someone has said i've learned
[41:39] that if you give a pig and a boy
[41:41] everything they want you'll get a good
[41:42] pig and a bad boy
[41:47] that's the problem with our democracies
[41:49] i want to speak to you tonight on what
[41:51] do you want
[41:53] what do you want a problem with our
[41:56] democracy is that people get what they
[41:58] want
[42:01] they get what they want and ultimately
[42:03] what we want is the wrong thing
[42:07] what what the world wants is the wrong
[42:09] thing and
[42:10] and i've got some
[42:13] pictures i think on the sides
[42:16] has happened today there was a
[42:20] headline which i thought was interesting
[42:21] in the new york post is why are so many
[42:23] women wearing purple at biden's
[42:24] inauguration today
[42:27] now i'm not going to start commenting on
[42:28] fashion choices
[42:31] though all of the former first ladies
[42:33] and the first lady are the
[42:36] vice president now of the united states
[42:39] wearing purple today and she was when
[42:42] she got swore in
[42:44] i want to be careful here because i
[42:45] don't want you to think i'm reading into
[42:47] things some
[42:48] something brother branham didn't say but
[42:49] i want us to know
[42:51] that people get what they want and we're
[42:54] seeing the fulfillment of that
[42:57] and brother branham says this and i
[42:59] won't spend long on this so just pay
[43:01] attention for just a moment we'll move
[43:02] on
[43:03] but brother brown says now i predicted
[43:05] and have said i saw
[43:06] great woman stand up beautiful looking
[43:10] dressed in real highly royal look like
[43:13] purple
[43:14] he saw her now whatever that means he
[43:16] saw it
[43:18] he says i got a little parenthesis down
[43:19] here down there here she was a great
[43:21] ruler in the united states
[43:23] perhaps the catholic church he said a
[43:26] woman
[43:27] some woman i don't know it'll be the
[43:29] catholic church i don't know i can't say
[43:32] only thing i've seen i've seen the woman
[43:34] that was
[43:35] all and then and from that time and
[43:38] there's many quotes you can go and i
[43:40] read them all today
[43:41] just to kind of try to get a balance on
[43:43] this but again i don't want to read in
[43:45] to something that's not there but
[43:49] brother brother says remember thus saith
[43:50] the lord there will be a woman rule
[43:52] before the end time
[43:54] she'll either be president vice
[43:57] president or it'll be the catholic
[43:58] church as a woman i've seen her
[44:00] a great woman the nation bowed to her
[44:03] so the nation wasn't fighting it the
[44:06] nation bowed to her
[44:08] they they get what they want
[44:12] and we had a lot of of uh turmoil in
[44:15] this election about
[44:17] election fraud and things but not about
[44:19] the popular vote
[44:21] the popular vote went decidedly
[44:24] to the democrat party and i'm not
[44:27] republican or democrat but just to show
[44:28] you people get
[44:30] what they want it's true
[44:34] people get what they want the nation as
[44:36] a whole wanted
[44:38] this and this is what they've got and
[44:41] and though many people did not but the
[44:43] nation as a whole now look
[44:46] he said the catholic church he said is
[44:48] on the rise
[44:50] we've had one catholic president will no
[44:52] doubt have another
[44:55] this is the first time that we could
[44:58] stand here in the pulpit
[45:00] and say this has come to pass
[45:04] since brother branham was here
[45:08] that ought to make you think today is
[45:11] the first time
[45:13] that we've been able to say there's been
[45:14] another catholic president
[45:16] i think it's the mercies of god to us
[45:19] until now but but we're seeing it these
[45:21] things are speeding up
[45:23] these things are happening and we're
[45:24] getting close to time
[45:28] what do you want today you get what you
[45:31] want
[45:33] look he's the catholic church he said is
[45:36] on the rise we have
[45:37] had one catholic president will not have
[45:38] another he said what is left nothing
[45:40] except hebrews 12 26
[45:42] whose voice then shook the earth but now
[45:44] he had promised saying yet once more has
[45:46] shaken up the earth only
[45:48] but also heaven and he talked about the
[45:49] earthquakes and the things
[45:51] would take place brother brown said this
[45:54] after that 1960 election
[45:57] in december of that year he said now so
[45:59] then i said there will be in that time
[46:02] during that time the women will be
[46:03] permitted to vote
[46:05] and they'll elect the wrong person he
[46:08] said they did it on this last election
[46:10] that was president kennedy
[46:12] he said that's right which will start
[46:14] the stronghold
[46:17] something happened in 1960 in this
[46:19] nation that started a stronghold
[46:23] and people don't recognize it but it's
[46:25] been going on since that time
[46:29] the people have been getting what they
[46:30] want
[46:32] right now look and i'm making a point
[46:35] with this
[46:36] but but it's something that's happening
[46:38] today and
[46:39] and he says he says during that time
[46:43] during that time it'll come to pass that
[46:46] there'll be a great woman rise up in the
[46:47] united states
[46:49] she'll be beautifully dressed he says my
[46:52] god in parenthesis perhaps the catholic
[46:54] church
[46:54] see he said and he goes on he said
[46:58] this woman now he said that'll take
[47:00] rulership over the power
[47:02] overpower the others in the united
[47:04] states
[47:06] now think about that after what's
[47:07] happened in the and the contested
[47:09] election and all of this
[47:10] and you look at a president that's 78
[47:13] years old and
[47:14] i'm not a prophet i can't stand you here
[47:16] and tell you thus saith the lord what
[47:18] will happen
[47:18] but i'm telling you we're living right
[47:20] at the end
[47:22] we know that and we've known that since
[47:24] brother branham was here but we're not
[47:26] seeing the beginnings of it
[47:27] we're not seeing in in its infancy we're
[47:30] seeing in its fulfillment
[47:33] we're seeing the very very top of it the
[47:36] very
[47:36] fruit of it very free could you imagine
[47:40] in 1960
[47:41] one of the cabinet members i don't
[47:44] remember which one but one of them is
[47:46] is i think it's over the health
[47:47] department is is a transgender
[47:50] it's a man dressing as a woman
[47:53] who's been appointed to be over the the
[47:55] health uh
[47:57] of this nation and and look at that and
[47:58] think where have we come to
[48:00] they couldn't have imagined that in 1960
[48:03] but what started as a stronghold there
[48:07] is coming out in 2021
[48:12] why because people eventually get what
[48:14] they want
[48:16] what their desire is this was satan's
[48:18] desire was to have this and he has
[48:21] what he wanted he finally has
[48:24] his eden the way that he wanted it but
[48:26] i'm so glad there's a place that's
[48:29] been prepared for us
[48:32] and it's something that not satan didn't
[48:34] want but christ
[48:35] wanted for his bride there's a place and
[48:38] there's something inside of us
[48:39] that calls us to that place amen
[48:44] now he said so she'll take rulership
[48:46] over the power overpower the others in
[48:48] the united states
[48:49] and you watch what'll take place if
[48:51] that's if that's
[48:52] what's going on right now there's some
[48:55] things that could happen now look he
[48:56] said she'll be beautiful to look at
[48:58] but she'll be cruel-hearted as she can
[49:00] be
[49:03] he said i said then i looked again
[49:06] and i saw the united states just blow to
[49:08] pieces
[49:10] that's it and you can go and find over
[49:13] and over again brother randall says i've
[49:14] seen five of the seven and one place
[49:16] brother branham talks about how that
[49:18] he says not a a woman but a church he
[49:21] talks about the church
[49:22] the catholic church taking over which
[49:24] has also happened in this election
[49:27] if you think about it all the supreme
[49:28] court justices now all
[49:30] the uh and they were republican
[49:32] appointed
[49:34] and and then you have now the president
[49:36] himself the entire power wrapped up in
[49:38] the catholic church and
[49:39] and and then you have this woman and
[49:42] brother branham talks about that but he
[49:44] also
[49:44] after that and you'll find it up in the
[49:46] 1964
[49:48] he talks about how that uh how that uh
[49:51] five of those visions had already come
[49:52] to pass
[49:54] he knew that five of them had come to
[49:56] pass
[49:57] i wonder tonight if we could say six of
[49:59] them have come to pass
[50:01] again i don't want to read anything into
[50:02] what brother branham says but look at
[50:03] the age we're living in
[50:05] we're living in the fulfillment of
[50:07] prophecy brother branham could look at
[50:09] what happened and
[50:10] is this the sign of the end sir and he
[50:11] could say when he come to
[50:13] what is the attraction on the mountain
[50:14] he said that was three years ago was
[50:16] prophecy now it's history where are we
[50:19] at
[50:20] church right at the end of the end
[50:26] at the end of the end aren't you glad to
[50:29] be the elect of god tonight
[50:31] say brother ben's what's going to happen
[50:33] i don't know i do know this he's coming
[50:35] for his bride
[50:36] there's going to be a body change that
[50:39] going to be tomorrow i don't know it
[50:40] could be it could be tonight it could be
[50:43] a hundred years from now but i know it's
[50:44] coming and i know these things had to
[50:47] happen now
[50:49] so brother brown said there was nothing
[50:50] left on it now in first samuel 2
[50:53] 12 13 there was an inauguration day of a
[50:56] new king in israel
[50:58] and the people got what they wanted
[51:01] samuel come to him
[51:02] they come to samuel rather than they
[51:03] said give us a king and samuel said we
[51:06] i don't want you to have a king or in
[51:09] other words
[51:10] haven't i always done things right and
[51:12] god led them through that prophetic
[51:13] ministry they said no we want a king
[51:16] god didn't want them to have a king at
[51:17] that time they said we want a king
[51:21] and so they come to samuel and and you
[51:23] know the story how that saul was chosen
[51:26] and on inauguration day samuel is
[51:29] is fulfilling the part of of the like
[51:32] the supreme court justice that would
[51:34] stand there and
[51:35] make him swear the oath and he stands
[51:36] there and he points to soul he says now
[51:38] therefore behold the king
[51:40] whom you have chosen whom you have
[51:42] desired
[51:43] and behold the lord has said a king over
[51:45] you
[51:47] in the sense that god allowed them to
[51:49] have it
[51:51] right god will give you what you want
[51:54] or we have to watch our desires don't we
[51:57] be careful what you want because you
[51:59] might get it
[52:01] the truth is you probably will get it
[52:05] whomever you desire and behold the king
[52:06] has sent or the lord has set a king over
[52:08] you
[52:09] and that kind of goes with the scripture
[52:11] that says
[52:12] i've gotten a man from the lord because
[52:15] god allowed it to happen
[52:17] all babies come from god but he was the
[52:19] son of perdition
[52:21] he was the seed of the serpent but saul
[52:24] was not serpent seed saul was just a man
[52:27] out of his place
[52:29] shouldn't have ever been the king but
[52:31] god allowed it now
[52:34] people almost always do what they want
[52:36] to do
[52:38] but it's the desires to want to that has
[52:41] to change
[52:43] right and that's what we have to see
[52:47] in this hour if there was ever a time
[52:50] when we should have a desire for the
[52:51] things of god
[52:52] it ought to be today there was a time
[52:55] when we should be able to cry out to god
[52:57] and this has been heavy on my heart
[52:59] recently even before these
[53:01] events of this last few days but there
[53:03] ever was a time
[53:04] for this to take place it ought to be
[53:06] now it ought to be today
[53:08] that the people of god could cry out
[53:10] lord come quickly
[53:12] that there would be such a a fervent
[53:14] desire
[53:15] to be in the presence of god and to
[53:17] fellowship with god and to say lord i
[53:19] want to come home
[53:21] i want to be there with you i'm tired of
[53:23] this whole world i'm tired of what it's
[53:25] becoming i'm tired
[53:26] of the news i'm tired of what's going on
[53:28] i'm ready to go
[53:30] there ever was a time that we ought to
[53:31] be on fire for goddess today
[53:34] and yet i see even a falling off of some
[53:37] of the fervor and things that we had in
[53:39] 2016
[53:40] when people thought that hillary clinton
[53:41] would be the the president that would
[53:44] come and
[53:44] and take over and so they see that and
[53:47] this
[53:48] would fit the prophecy in a more direct
[53:50] way as far as being a catholic president
[53:52] of things than that does
[53:53] and that did but back then it seemed
[53:56] like people were all
[53:57] nervous and excited people started
[53:59] coming to church and doing things
[54:00] because
[54:01] they thought that was happening where's
[54:03] that at today
[54:04] even the charismatic church got involved
[54:06] and things you don't see that as much
[54:08] today why because the world is dulled
[54:11] people's senses we're living in an hour
[54:14] when people have gotten what they want
[54:16] and it's become just a playground
[54:18] satan's eating brother brown said he
[54:19] made it easy to sin in
[54:21] oh but i tell you what a true christian
[54:23] today and i trust that you're a true
[54:25] christian here on a wednesday night
[54:26] there's something on the inside of you
[54:28] you're just not happy here anymore
[54:31] you're ready to go home amen
[54:36] see the desire needs to be changed god
[54:38] doesn't want to take away your desires
[54:39] he wants to make them right
[54:42] it's not that we have too strong a
[54:44] desire that our desires
[54:46] many times are for the wrong things this
[54:49] quote of
[54:50] c.s lewis has always struck me and says
[54:52] it would seem
[54:53] that our lord finds our desires not too
[54:55] strong
[54:56] but too weak we are half-hearted
[54:59] creatures
[55:00] fooling about with drink and sex and
[55:02] ambition
[55:04] when infinite joy has offered us he said
[55:07] like an ignorant child who wants to go
[55:09] on making mud pies in a slum
[55:11] because he cannot imagine what is meant
[55:13] by the offer of a holiday at the sea
[55:17] we are far too easily pleased
[55:20] god help us today we're far too easily
[55:24] pleased
[55:24] because we're comfortable and we've got
[55:26] everything that we could ever want
[55:28] and it's an age when when everything
[55:29] increases and goods increase
[55:31] and everything looks like it's it's a
[55:33] wonderful age to live in
[55:35] but we're far too easily pleased with
[55:37] those things
[55:40] we find in genesis 3 3 6 that
[55:44] eve didn't have a desire for these
[55:46] things
[55:48] but satan come and begin to talk her
[55:49] into it
[55:51] and when he reasoned with her he changed
[55:53] eve's desires
[55:55] listen it says when the woman saw the
[55:57] tree was good for food
[55:59] that it was pleasant to the eyes and a
[56:01] tree to be desired
[56:04] to make one wise she took of the fruit
[56:07] thereof and did he
[56:08] and gave also unto her husband with her
[56:11] and he did
[56:12] when she saw that it was desirable
[56:16] and she did it what it happened there
[56:18] was the desire she didn't know it was
[56:20] there but that desire became awakened
[56:23] when she listened to the serpent brother
[56:25] random tells us that by your desire you
[56:27] can tell who is on the throne of your
[56:28] heart
[56:32] that's a powerful statement what do you
[56:35] want
[56:40] i sat here sunday night
[56:44] counseling through the afternoon with
[56:46] someone and
[56:47] sitting here and i ask them that
[56:48] question what do you want i've asked it
[56:50] before counseling what do you want
[56:53] what's the point of all this that you're
[56:55] doing and what you're going through
[56:56] what's the end result what do you want
[57:01] the person said to be happy
[57:06] i don't think they'd mind me saying that
[57:08] because we all want that
[57:12] we want to be happy but i told them this
[57:15] i said
[57:16] you can't be happy by trying to make
[57:18] yourself happy
[57:20] it's the worst way to make yourself
[57:22] happy
[57:24] you try to make somebody else happy and
[57:26] you might be happy
[57:29] we'll talk about that a little bit more
[57:30] but we find satan
[57:32] his desire was to make his own ministry
[57:34] bigger than all the others and
[57:36] you can look in isaiah chapter 14 and
[57:38] verse 12 he had this desire
[57:40] he says howard thou fallen from heaven
[57:42] oh lucifer son of the morning
[57:44] howarth thou cut down to the ground
[57:45] which just weakened the nations
[57:47] for thou has said in thine heart this is
[57:49] what you begin to want
[57:51] your wants are powerful things
[57:55] your wants are powerful things what do
[57:56] you want you look at young people that
[57:59] are about to
[57:59] on on the verge and they're halting
[58:01] between two opinions brother andrew said
[58:03] sunday
[58:03] and they're right there on the edge and
[58:05] they can step this way and go into the
[58:06] world or step this way and become a
[58:08] committed christian
[58:09] and they're right there on the edge what
[58:11] do you want
[58:14] you want to be loved by the world do you
[58:16] want all the pleasures and things that
[58:18] the world can provide
[58:19] or do you want a home and a family and
[58:22] to feel the peace of god in your life
[58:25] you could go either way what do you want
[58:28] satan's in heaven you can't blame
[58:31] anything on the surroundings of the
[58:33] church or the pastor
[58:36] but he's in heaven and he's sitting
[58:38] there and he's
[58:40] it says thou instead of my heart i will
[58:41] ascend into heaven
[58:43] i will exalt my throne above the stars
[58:45] of god i will sit also upon the mount of
[58:47] the congregation on the sides of the
[58:48] north
[58:49] this became his overwhelming desire
[58:53] amen to move out of his place into a
[58:57] place he didn't belong
[59:00] he said i will ascend above the heights
[59:02] of the clouds
[59:03] i will be like the most high
[59:08] yet thou shall be brought down to hell
[59:10] to the sides of the pit
[59:11] and see it wasn't given to angels to do
[59:13] that it wasn't given to angels to be
[59:15] like the most high that was given to the
[59:17] sons and daughters of god
[59:20] but here he with this fallen angel said
[59:22] yet thou shalt be brought down to hell
[59:24] the sides of the pit
[59:25] i've watched over the years bear with me
[59:27] for a moment we're kind of dwelling on
[59:29] the bad side we'll get to the good side
[59:30] in a moment but i've watched over the
[59:32] years many men
[59:33] and women destroy their families because
[59:36] they want something
[59:38] they want something and it starts out as
[59:42] just a minor irritation
[59:44] something they wish they could have or
[59:46] experience
[59:48] and then one day it becomes an
[59:49] overwhelming desire
[59:52] and they get it and they get what comes
[59:54] with it too
[59:57] proverbs 7 22 speaks to this and
[1:00:00] speaking of a man that would go after a
[1:00:01] strange woman
[1:00:03] or a bad woman he says he goes after her
[1:00:05] straightway as an ox go to the slaughter
[1:00:07] as a fool to the correction of the
[1:00:09] stalks
[1:00:11] till a dart strike through its liver
[1:00:12] look at the graphic language here as a
[1:00:14] bird
[1:00:15] he says to the snare why because he
[1:00:18] wants something he wants the
[1:00:20] what's in the trap why does the mouse
[1:00:23] get in the trap because he wants the
[1:00:25] cheese
[1:00:26] he wants it it's an overwhelming desire
[1:00:29] but
[1:00:30] he says knoweth not that is for his life
[1:00:34] amen verse 24 hearken unto me now
[1:00:38] therefore you children attended the
[1:00:39] words of my mouth
[1:00:40] let not thine heart decline to her way
[1:00:42] he's going out astray in her past
[1:00:43] for she has cast down many wounded yay
[1:00:46] many strong men have been slain by her
[1:00:48] her house is the way to hell
[1:00:51] going down to the chambers of death but
[1:00:53] i want it
[1:00:55] you're going to die with it too
[1:01:00] but people usually get what they want
[1:01:03] but they also get what comes with it
[1:01:08] the gay rights people said we want to be
[1:01:10] recognized
[1:01:11] they're recognized now as of today you
[1:01:14] can choose your pronoun when you contact
[1:01:16] the white house
[1:01:18] you can be a vey or them or or a shim or
[1:01:21] whatever else you want to be
[1:01:25] they got what they wanted but you get
[1:01:27] what comes with it
[1:01:29] amen proverbs 9
[1:01:32] 16 says whoso is simple let him turn in
[1:01:35] hither and
[1:01:35] as for him that wanteth understanding
[1:01:37] she said to him
[1:01:39] or that lacks understanding in that case
[1:01:40] she says to him stolen waters are sweet
[1:01:43] this is the woman trying to draw him in
[1:01:45] bread eating in secret is pleasant
[1:01:48] but he knoweth not that the dead are
[1:01:49] there that are guests are in the depths
[1:01:52] of hell
[1:01:54] what do you want if you want
[1:01:57] what you've got you'll have to deal with
[1:01:59] repercussions of the fall
[1:02:02] amen you want to be enlightened do you
[1:02:04] want to
[1:02:05] know more about the world you want to
[1:02:06] know more about what's going on in the
[1:02:08] world
[1:02:08] you have to deal with the repercussions
[1:02:10] of that
[1:02:13] as i said a person might say i want to
[1:02:15] be happy
[1:02:16] but the path to happiness doesn't lay to
[1:02:19] the door of the harlot
[1:02:21] it doesn't lay through the door of
[1:02:22] denominations
[1:02:24] and doesn't lay to the door of the world
[1:02:27] but lays through
[1:02:28] gethsemane the road to happiness
[1:02:33] is through death to self
[1:02:36] amen we know that because jesus
[1:02:41] in hebrews 12 1 paul tells us that we're
[1:02:43] foreseeing we also
[1:02:44] are compassed about with so great a
[1:02:45] cloud of witnesses let us lay aside
[1:02:48] every weight we're not trying to make
[1:02:49] ourselves happy we're trying to get rid
[1:02:51] of anything that would hinder us
[1:02:54] from the race let us lay aside every
[1:02:55] weight and the sin which does so easily
[1:02:57] beset us
[1:02:58] and let us run with patience the race
[1:03:01] that is set before us
[1:03:03] looking unto jesus the author and
[1:03:06] finisher of our faith
[1:03:07] who for the joy that was set before him
[1:03:11] see there was happiness coming but to
[1:03:13] get there but the caleb
[1:03:14] had to go through gethsemane he had to
[1:03:16] walk the via dolorosa he had to go to
[1:03:18] the cross
[1:03:18] in order to have happiness you want to
[1:03:20] have happiness in your family
[1:03:22] make your life a self-sacrificial life
[1:03:25] you want to have happiness here in the
[1:03:26] church you want to be happy sacrifice
[1:03:29] yourself
[1:03:30] to the will of god for your life let
[1:03:33] yourself die out to the world and the
[1:03:34] things of the world
[1:03:36] and god there will be joy in front of
[1:03:38] you because of your sacrifice
[1:03:41] you see the measure of how badly you
[1:03:43] want something
[1:03:44] is taken by what you're willing to give
[1:03:46] up to get it
[1:03:51] if you desire god there's something
[1:03:54] there inside of your heart now let's
[1:03:56] look at this as a
[1:03:57] on the good side now because there's
[1:03:59] been many in the scripture that wanted
[1:04:00] god
[1:04:02] if you want something because of the
[1:04:03] love of god in your heart faith will
[1:04:05] produce the object of your desire
[1:04:07] something there love produces a want a
[1:04:10] desire for god
[1:04:12] hebrews 11 24 which we know ultimately
[1:04:15] comes from the seed
[1:04:17] that's there if you don't have a seed
[1:04:18] you just don't have that desire
[1:04:21] so it makes sense that's pretty simple
[1:04:23] if you still have a desire for god
[1:04:25] then run to god
[1:04:28] don't do it half-heartedly there's
[1:04:30] nobody more miserable than someone who
[1:04:32] tries
[1:04:32] half half the time to serve god and half
[1:04:34] the time to serve the world
[1:04:36] run to the word of god
[1:04:39] run like the the deer that's thirsty as
[1:04:41] brother brandon preaches that very
[1:04:42] similar message where he talks about
[1:04:44] thirst
[1:04:44] run like the deer that is wounded and
[1:04:47] has to get to water shall die
[1:04:49] run to the water amen if you desire god
[1:04:54] run to the water and the scripture tells
[1:04:56] us by faith moses when he was come to
[1:04:58] years
[1:04:59] refused to be called the son of
[1:05:00] pharaoh's daughter choosing rather to
[1:05:03] suffer affliction with the people of god
[1:05:05] than to enjoy the pleasure of sin for a
[1:05:07] season
[1:05:08] esteeming the reproach of christ greater
[1:05:10] riches than the treasures in egypt
[1:05:12] for he had respect unto the recompense
[1:05:14] of the reward he conceived down the road
[1:05:16] see faith gives you a vision
[1:05:18] to be able to see beyond just what's
[1:05:20] there you're looking at the unseen
[1:05:22] looking at something that's more real
[1:05:24] than the current pleasure something
[1:05:26] that's more real
[1:05:27] than just the moment something more real
[1:05:29] even than the election or anything else
[1:05:31] that's going on
[1:05:32] there's something more real amen the
[1:05:34] reality of the word of god is more real
[1:05:37] so he said he had respect of the unto
[1:05:39] the recompense of the reward
[1:05:40] by faith he forsook egypt not fearing
[1:05:42] the wrath of the king
[1:05:43] for he endured seeing him who is
[1:05:46] invisible
[1:05:47] isn't that who you want to see tonight
[1:05:49] and i'm always saying open the eyes of
[1:05:50] my heart lord
[1:05:52] let me see you let me see the one who is
[1:05:54] invisible
[1:05:57] david wanted to be in god's house
[1:06:01] if you look at david there's just
[1:06:02] something about david he wanted to be in
[1:06:04] the house of god
[1:06:06] and the bible says david was a man after
[1:06:08] god's own heart in other words he
[1:06:09] david wanted things that god wanted
[1:06:14] what do you want you see the world's got
[1:06:16] what they want what do you want tonight
[1:06:19] what does hardy arkansas want what does
[1:06:22] word of life tabernacle want
[1:06:24] what what do you want
[1:06:28] there's something real inside your life
[1:06:30] that would reach out and make you
[1:06:32] even if it was uncomfortable even if it
[1:06:33] was caused hardship even if it was hard
[1:06:36] but you still want to be in the presence
[1:06:38] of god
[1:06:40] and so david says in psalms 27 4 one
[1:06:43] thing have i desired of the lord
[1:06:45] that will i seek after that i may dwell
[1:06:47] in the house of the lord
[1:06:48] all the days of my life to behold the
[1:06:52] beauty of the lord
[1:06:53] to inquire in his temple he wanted to be
[1:06:57] there why because he loved the word amen
[1:07:01] he was a man after god's own heart he
[1:07:02] loved the word and he loved to worship
[1:07:06] amen see if we don't have that love
[1:07:09] to worship in our lives and i want you
[1:07:12] to stay i i don't want to say this too
[1:07:14] harshly because
[1:07:16] you know people will come many times and
[1:07:18] they just don't have that love
[1:07:20] and then one day when they're under the
[1:07:21] atmosphere of the holy ghost things
[1:07:23] begin to change in their life
[1:07:25] one day they realize they want to be in
[1:07:26] the presence of god
[1:07:28] but that old shell's got them down but
[1:07:31] many times
[1:07:32] so i want you to keep coming and come in
[1:07:34] the presence of god
[1:07:35] but many times we sit through services
[1:07:37] if you don't want
[1:07:38] to be in god's presence you won't
[1:07:41] respond
[1:07:42] to the word you won't respond to the
[1:07:45] to the preaching you won't respond to
[1:07:47] the to the music you won't respond to
[1:07:49] the presence of god
[1:07:50] and you just sit there and go in and go
[1:07:52] out and and nothing's changed except you
[1:07:54] got a little worse
[1:07:56] than what you were but he said one thing
[1:08:00] have a desire to the lord can we say
[1:08:02] that that's us tonight i desire yes
[1:08:05] there's many things i want i
[1:08:07] i you may say i want a better car i want
[1:08:09] a better house
[1:08:11] i want a better job i want i want to be
[1:08:14] married i want to
[1:08:16] some people want to be unmarried
[1:08:18] whatever it is that you want
[1:08:20] but more than anything else i want
[1:08:23] to be in the house of the lord and i
[1:08:26] think we can say today david wanted to
[1:08:28] be in his physical house i think we
[1:08:29] could say i want to be
[1:08:31] the house of the lord amen
[1:08:34] that's my desire whatever it takes god i
[1:08:37] want to be your house
[1:08:43] his wants and gods once became the same
[1:08:45] why they both wanted fellowship
[1:08:49] brother branham tells us and i know this
[1:08:50] message took a strange turn
[1:08:52] but you know it's in hours like this we
[1:08:54] should re-examine what we want
[1:08:58] why we're here while you're listening
[1:08:59] there on the stream or wherever that
[1:09:00] you're at tonight
[1:09:01] why you're here i know many of you can't
[1:09:03] come on wednesday night but you want to
[1:09:04] be here there's a desire
[1:09:06] and you watch the services you want this
[1:09:08] is your church you want to be a part
[1:09:10] you want to be here and so there's
[1:09:13] something inside of you
[1:09:14] what is it that wants that brother brown
[1:09:17] said at one time
[1:09:18] man had perfect fellowship with god that
[1:09:20] was god's purpose
[1:09:21] he said that's the reason it's a crave
[1:09:23] in your heart it's a longing for
[1:09:24] something of contact
[1:09:27] amen he said i love the word don't you
[1:09:30] he said you know why you love the word
[1:09:33] bill james and i can sit and talk about
[1:09:35] the word for hours
[1:09:37] i love the word don't you hey man
[1:09:40] do you know why you love the word amen
[1:09:44] you have the holy spirit in you amen
[1:09:48] but the bible said that man does not
[1:09:49] live by bread alone but by every word
[1:09:51] that proceedeth out of the mouth of god
[1:09:53] he said so the holy spirit feeds on the
[1:09:55] word
[1:09:56] and then when you hear the word he said
[1:09:59] everyone wants to hear it no matter
[1:10:01] every little piece of literature they
[1:10:02] can pick up
[1:10:05] now think about this this is someone
[1:10:06] that wants that speeds on the word that
[1:10:08] wants to hear the word
[1:10:09] everyone wants to hear it every little
[1:10:11] piece of literature they can pick up
[1:10:12] they read it
[1:10:13] they listen to the radio they go to
[1:10:15] church and so forth
[1:10:17] because they are longing for that
[1:10:19] fellowship
[1:10:20] around the word amen
[1:10:24] some of you are streaming tonight some
[1:10:26] of you are not able to be here but
[1:10:27] you're longing for that fellowship
[1:10:28] around the word
[1:10:29] he said they listen to the radio every
[1:10:31] little piece of literature they read
[1:10:32] they try to
[1:10:33] get in touch with god why because they
[1:10:35] want that fellowship around the word
[1:10:40] do you know why the opening of the word
[1:10:42] and the revealing of the son of man came
[1:10:43] in our day
[1:10:44] but andrew talked about that sunday
[1:10:46] morning why did that happen in our day
[1:10:48] lebron says in abraham he said god would
[1:10:50] represent himself again in human flesh
[1:10:52] just before the coming of the son of man
[1:10:54] what flesh your flesh
[1:10:58] my flesh god coming down from heaven
[1:11:02] why did he come like that why did he
[1:11:04] come and shout a message
[1:11:05] why did he come like that to nrh
[1:11:09] because he wanted fellowship god coming
[1:11:12] down from heaven god
[1:11:14] longing for fellowship
[1:11:17] and god's power to transform i know i'm
[1:11:19] reading a lot but i want to get through
[1:11:21] this without wearing you out tonight
[1:11:23] he said oh wandering stars how long will
[1:11:25] you wonder
[1:11:26] you methodist baptist presbyterians
[1:11:28] outsiders whatever you might be
[1:11:30] wandering stars
[1:11:31] from church to church from pillar to
[1:11:33] place television to television world to
[1:11:35] world

[1:11:38] have fellowship with you
[1:11:41] he is longing for you what do you want
[1:11:45] i'll tell you what he wants he wants you
[1:11:49] he wants me and if i'm not careful i get
[1:11:53] up in the morning
[1:11:54] and and i rush around to get the kids up
[1:11:56] and brush my teeth and get everything
[1:11:57] ready and
[1:11:58] maybe run down to the church or do some
[1:12:00] business have some things to do
[1:12:01] study for a while and all of the things
[1:12:04] that i do
[1:12:05] but he wants me he don't just want
[1:12:10] what i do are you with me now
[1:12:13] you don't want just want me as a pastor
[1:12:15] he wants me
[1:12:17] he wants to have fellowship with me he
[1:12:19] don't just want you as a husband or as a
[1:12:20] wife or as a
[1:12:21] as a deacon or a trustee or whatever
[1:12:23] that you are he wants you
[1:12:27] and that's why we give him a little time
[1:12:29] at the end of the service and
[1:12:30] i would to god that that would just
[1:12:32] become richer and richer in our lives
[1:12:35] he wants you he wants to talk to you
[1:12:37] you've heard the word and he's been
[1:12:38] speaking to you through the service
[1:12:40] let that just wash over you he wants you
[1:12:42] he's longing for you
[1:12:44] he wants to transform you by the
[1:12:46] renewing of your mind
[1:12:47] what do you want he wants to transform
[1:12:50] you
[1:12:51] amen not to the church or to the
[1:12:53] denomination but to his word
[1:12:54] which you are part of if that desire is
[1:12:58] in you
[1:13:00] oh god what do you want
[1:13:04] i guarantee you you don't want the word
[1:13:07] as bad as he wants you
[1:13:09] as bad as he as bad as you want the word
[1:13:11] you still have the flesh i still have
[1:13:13] the flesh
[1:13:13] but he wants you unencumbered by that
[1:13:18] amen he said
[1:13:21] blessed are they that do hunger and
[1:13:23] thirst for righteousness for they shall
[1:13:25] be filled see
[1:13:26] and the rapture brother brown said now
[1:13:28] so you were in if you've got eternal
[1:13:30] life you were in god before there ever
[1:13:31] was
[1:13:32] a world you are a part a son of god an
[1:13:34] attribute of god he knew the very age
[1:13:36] you were coming
[1:13:37] he knowed because i should have read it
[1:13:39] that way
[1:13:41] you'll forgive me sometimes i correct
[1:13:42] brother with english and i don't do that
[1:13:44] intentionally
[1:13:45] i worked in a job where my basically my
[1:13:47] job was correcting people's english for
[1:13:49] for 15 years and so i'll read it right
[1:13:52] even if
[1:13:53] brother brown says it wrong so many
[1:13:54] times but it's not wrong
[1:13:56] we know what he's talking about
[1:14:00] amen he says he knew he knowed
[1:14:04] the very age you were coming
[1:14:07] and he predestinated you he predestined
[1:14:10] you to that age
[1:14:12] to take that place and no one else can
[1:14:15] take it
[1:14:16] you know what he's talking about don't
[1:14:17] you he said care how many impersonations
[1:14:19] and things you've got to be there
[1:14:21] because he knew you would be there now
[1:14:24] you're made manifest now you can have
[1:14:26] fellowship with him
[1:14:28] and that's what he wants
[1:14:31] amen he let you come the way that you
[1:14:34] did
[1:14:34] and let you be raised the way that you
[1:14:36] were that's not good english either but
[1:14:38] come up the way that you are he let you
[1:14:40] be who you are why
[1:14:43] because he wants you he's longing for
[1:14:47] fellowship
[1:14:48] and you were made manifest on this earth
[1:14:50] because he wants to fellowship with you
[1:14:53] not not your flesh but he wants to
[1:14:55] fellowship with that seed that's inside
[1:14:57] of you
[1:14:57] now he said now you are made manifest so
[1:14:59] that now you can fellowship with him and
[1:15:01] that's what he wants
[1:15:02] he's longing for fellowship to be
[1:15:06] worshipped
[1:15:09] so he comes to church and he's sisters
[1:15:11] and just thinks oh i hope they worship
[1:15:13] me tonight
[1:15:15] if we can put it in human terms you
[1:15:17] understand he knows what you're going to
[1:15:19] do but you know if we can put it in
[1:15:20] human terms it's that longing
[1:15:21] oh i hope they worship me tonight i hope
[1:15:24] they take a little bit of time
[1:15:26] and stop thinking about what's going on
[1:15:28] on the outside
[1:15:30] i hope they just take a little bit of
[1:15:31] time and just spend it in my presence i
[1:15:33] want to fellowship with them i want
[1:15:35] i want i want to speak to them the words
[1:15:37] of life
[1:15:39] i want to be i want them to be a a part
[1:15:41] of me i want i want to be have that that
[1:15:43] intimate fellowship
[1:15:45] imagine if someone comes and maybe
[1:15:47] you've done something that's wrong
[1:15:48] even as a christian sometimes we do
[1:15:50] things that are wrong don't we
[1:15:52] you've done something that's not right
[1:15:55] and you know and
[1:15:56] and you sit there and you think oh i i
[1:15:58] need to repent of that
[1:15:59] and you just see the holy spirit how
[1:16:02] that maybe you've had that anger that
[1:16:03] bitterness so that
[1:16:04] that that thing you let that worry take
[1:16:06] over your life that frustration
[1:16:08] and he sits there but the rhetoric says
[1:16:10] the holy ghost goes to the gable end of
[1:16:12] your soul he doesn't leave you
[1:16:14] but it's you don't feel that presence in
[1:16:16] your life
[1:16:17] you don't feel the the effects of the
[1:16:19] holy spirit in your life
[1:16:20] he's been grieved from you but don't you
[1:16:23] know he's there saying
[1:16:25] oh i want you to repent
[1:16:29] i want you to come back to me i want you
[1:16:31] to and all it would take is just lord
[1:16:33] i'm sorry
[1:16:36] i don't want to be that way i don't want
[1:16:38] to be that old that old cruel hard
[1:16:40] person
[1:16:41] lord i'm sorry i know that's not right
[1:16:43] and here he comes
[1:16:45] why does he forgive us over and over and
[1:16:47] over again
[1:16:48] because he wants to have fellowship with
[1:16:51] us
[1:16:53] the world got what they wanted satan got
[1:16:55] what he wanted
[1:16:56] how much more will god get what he wants
[1:17:00] amen thank you lord
[1:17:04] he's longing for fellowship to be
[1:17:06] worshipped
[1:17:07] he said i wonder if we recognize how
[1:17:11] much he wants you
[1:17:13] if we could ask god today what do you
[1:17:14] want
[1:17:16] i want you amen brother branham tells us
[1:17:20] jesus only asked for one thing in his
[1:17:22] prayer to the father
[1:17:24] he said you know what that was one thing
[1:17:26] after all of his sacrifice that he did
[1:17:27] here on the earth
[1:17:28] the life that he lived the path that he
[1:17:30] walked he asked for one thing
[1:17:33] where i am they may be also you ask
[1:17:37] for our fellowship
[1:17:40] amen so that's the only thing he asked
[1:17:44] the father in prayer
[1:17:46] your companionship forever
[1:17:50] amen oh don't you love him tonight let
[1:17:52] me make you want to worship your lord
[1:17:54] don't make you want to fellowship with
[1:17:55] him because he asked the father in
[1:17:57] prayer one thing
[1:17:58] your companionship forever he said
[1:18:01] listen saint john 17
[1:18:02] the 24th verse he said then how much
[1:18:05] should we desire him
[1:18:07] amen he said now listen he said if he
[1:18:10] desire now listen
[1:18:11] if you really are born of the spirit of
[1:18:13] god that means
[1:18:15] everything to you
[1:18:19] it means everything to you and i watch
[1:18:22] people
[1:18:22] maybe somebody don't let them sing when
[1:18:24] they think they should or or maybe
[1:18:26] have them sing when they think they
[1:18:27] shouldn't they quit coming to church
[1:18:32] they'll quit depending on the house of
[1:18:34] god maybe some will get on there
[1:18:35] somebody will say something to them a
[1:18:36] little bit off maybe say something
[1:18:37] that's bad
[1:18:39] you know say something rude to them and
[1:18:40] it was rude but they'll let that keep
[1:18:42] them away from fellowship
[1:18:47] when brother a prophet told us that you
[1:18:49] want it more than anything else
[1:18:54] more than anything else
[1:18:58] i just want fellowship i i've made a lot
[1:19:00] of mistakes
[1:19:01] i know every one of us here could say
[1:19:02] that we made a lot of mistakes but
[1:19:04] ultimately what do i want
[1:19:05] i want fellowship with god i want
[1:19:08] fellowship i'm
[1:19:09] i'm not perfect but i want fellowship
[1:19:12] and if that desire for fellowship is
[1:19:14] there
[1:19:14] i'll climb over the rocks and and and go
[1:19:17] under the fences and anything i have to
[1:19:19] do
[1:19:20] to have fellowship with god and brother
[1:19:22] brother said it ain't some book of rules
[1:19:25] you don't live by law any laws and so
[1:19:27] forth you don't come to church on
[1:19:28] wednesday night because you
[1:19:29] have to or because you're afraid i'm
[1:19:31] going to preach at you because you
[1:19:33] didn't
[1:19:35] ain't some book of rules you don't live
[1:19:37] in any laws and so forth you live by the
[1:19:38] grace of god
[1:19:40] you want it more than anything else how
[1:19:43] could you keep somebody who wants
[1:19:45] something more than anything else
[1:19:48] you take somebody wants a new car
[1:19:49] they're always in the car a lot
[1:19:54] until they get that new car they're
[1:19:55] always on the internet looking at cars
[1:19:58] my daughter wants something my daughter
[1:20:00] decided here not long ago excuse me
[1:20:02] esther but she
[1:20:02] they wanted a tent my two daughters
[1:20:04] decided they wanted one little play
[1:20:06] tents and
[1:20:06] they want that more than anything else
[1:20:08] in the world
[1:20:11] i've watched them amused because i
[1:20:13] wouldn't buy them one i think they
[1:20:14] finally got one
[1:20:15] through the black market but
[1:20:18] i wouldn't buy them one and and but i
[1:20:22] watched them i was so amused by it
[1:20:23] because they look
[1:20:24] through amazon stuff and they they know
[1:20:26] better than to push the button
[1:20:29] to buy it
[1:20:32] but they want it so bad it just becomes
[1:20:35] a consuming desire
[1:20:37] all right i hope we can only have that
[1:20:39] kind of desire for god
[1:20:43] that every day we'd flip through our
[1:20:45] phone whatever it is we wouldn't be
[1:20:46] looking for a tent we wouldn't be
[1:20:48] looking for
[1:20:48] something else we'd be looking for god
[1:20:51] looking for his fellowship looking for
[1:20:53] fellowship with other believers
[1:20:54] it ain't some book of rules you don't do
[1:20:56] that because i can't make you do that
[1:20:58] there's nothing i could do to make you
[1:20:59] do that you don't live by laws you live
[1:21:01] by the grace of god
[1:21:04] amen amen
[1:21:07] i wonder today if we're willing to give
[1:21:09] god what he wants he said i want to be
[1:21:11] happy are you willing to give him what
[1:21:12] he wants
[1:21:14] are you willing to make god happy
[1:21:17] well you said brother ben how could i
[1:21:18] make him happy i don't know
[1:21:21] i won't hold you much longer tonight but
[1:21:22] brother brown says this
[1:21:25] he said in christ the mystery of god
[1:21:27] revealed said now you've got tapes on
[1:21:28] that you've got tapes on what we believe
[1:21:30] you've got tapes on discipline in the
[1:21:31] church how we behave ourselves in the
[1:21:32] church of god
[1:21:34] how we got to come here together and sit
[1:21:37] together in heavenly places
[1:21:41] he said don't stay home if god is in
[1:21:43] your heart you you can't hardly wait for
[1:21:44] them doors to open out you honor
[1:21:47] he didn't sit there and say how
[1:21:48] preachers we talked about that earlier
[1:21:49] but he didn't say now preachers you make
[1:21:51] sure they're in church on wednesday
[1:21:52] night
[1:21:55] he said don't stay home but if god is in
[1:21:57] your heart you can't hardly wait for
[1:21:58] them doors to open out yonder
[1:22:00] to get in here to fellowship with your
[1:22:01] brothers and i know many of you are like
[1:22:03] that i know there's people who've been
[1:22:05] in such pain
[1:22:06] through all this this problem that we've
[1:22:08] had and such turmoil and some people
[1:22:10] that can't come
[1:22:11] and i see that and i recognize that but
[1:22:13] there's a desire there
[1:22:17] and sometimes people that come don't
[1:22:18] have that desire god help us today
[1:22:22] but we've got to keep that fire alive
[1:22:25] don't stay home if god is in your heart
[1:22:26] you can't hardly wait for them doors to
[1:22:28] open out your under to get in here to
[1:22:29] fellowship with your brothers you may
[1:22:31] get sick or have a problem and
[1:22:33] you know for the first time in our life
[1:22:34] we've had to tell sick people to stay
[1:22:35] away
[1:22:37] you know we've always said come to
[1:22:38] church if you're sick and we'll lay
[1:22:40] hands on you we believe you'll get
[1:22:41] better
[1:22:42] and now you start telling people that
[1:22:43] are sick to stay away and i understand
[1:22:45] the reason
[1:22:46] but there's still a desire they want to
[1:22:47] be there
[1:22:49] if god is in your heart you can't hardly
[1:22:50] wait for them doors to open out yonder
[1:22:52] to get in here to fellowship with your
[1:22:53] brothers
[1:22:54] he said if you don't feel that way then
[1:22:55] i tell you it's time you got to pray
[1:22:58] something's happened to the want
[1:23:02] listen why he said because we're in the
[1:23:06] last days
[1:23:12] how could we say anymore how could i i
[1:23:15] could come up here and yell and scream
[1:23:16] about it or whatever but we laid it out
[1:23:17] before you
[1:23:18] we're in the last days we're at the end
[1:23:21] of the end
[1:23:23] there's nothing left if there ever was a
[1:23:26] time to fulfill the scripture much more
[1:23:28] as we see the day approaching
[1:23:30] and i'll just say that doesn't mean
[1:23:33] we'll have necessarily have more
[1:23:34] services but when we have church we'll
[1:23:36] want to be there
[1:23:40] it doesn't because the early church
[1:23:41] didn't have two services on sunday and
[1:23:43] i'll get in trouble for that but it's
[1:23:44] the truth
[1:23:45] and we may have one or two but the early
[1:23:47] church probably just had one
[1:23:50] but it lasted a while
[1:23:54] but you know that i'm not a fan of long
[1:23:56] services but you understand
[1:23:59] there's a want there's a desire i'd
[1:24:02] rather have people that wanted to be
[1:24:03] there and be there for five minutes and
[1:24:04] spend three hours where people didn't
[1:24:05] want to be there
[1:24:09] i'll say this if you don't want to come
[1:24:10] to church don't come to church
[1:24:13] but oh i would pray that god would give
[1:24:14] you a desire
[1:24:18] give you a desire to be in the house of
[1:24:19] god
[1:24:22] i want to tell my kids that too i'd say
[1:24:24] that quietly to them but
[1:24:27] you know that has to be stirred up in
[1:24:30] you
[1:24:32] paul says stir up the gift that's in you
[1:24:35] right sometimes we got to stir up the
[1:24:36] gift
[1:24:37] stir up that seed let that seed take
[1:24:39] preeminence in our life
[1:24:41] but there's still something there you
[1:24:43] understand
[1:24:44] he said much more as we see the day
[1:24:46] approaching to love one another with
[1:24:47] christian love and divine love to
[1:24:48] assemble ourselves together
[1:24:50] in heavenly places in christ jesus and
[1:24:53] love one another
[1:24:55] why because we're in the last days
[1:24:58] do i need to get a sign put it out here
[1:25:00] like the end is coming
[1:25:02] the end is near do we need to stand out
[1:25:04] on the road and wave a sign maybe pay
[1:25:06] that guy that stands down there to put
[1:25:07] up a sign say the end is near
[1:25:09] we don't have to do that that's not what
[1:25:12] excites us we see the word being
[1:25:13] fulfilled in our day
[1:25:16] and we realize the end is near and
[1:25:18] during this time
[1:25:20] we ought to be that much more desirous
[1:25:22] of being together
[1:25:24] than we ever were this will all men know
[1:25:28] that you're my disciples when you have
[1:25:29] love one for the other
[1:25:31] he said that's right stay right together
[1:25:34] well go on he said if the brother you
[1:25:36] think he's a little wrong with his
[1:25:37] sister i know this is so familiar to you
[1:25:39] but
[1:25:40] could we just reawaken it for a moment
[1:25:42] think about it
[1:25:43] listen to me you've heard that prophecy
[1:25:45] about that woman coming into power all
[1:25:46] these years
[1:25:48] and then you see it whether at the
[1:25:49] literal fulfillment or not you see the
[1:25:51] catholic church coming in
[1:25:52] you see a woman in a position of power
[1:25:54] like that and you begin to think
[1:25:56] you've heard it for years and years but
[1:25:58] it was still god's word
[1:26:00] a genuine prophet said thus saith the
[1:26:02] lord
[1:26:04] and it's according to the scriptures you
[1:26:08] understand it so now we're seeing it
[1:26:10] amen amen and if that don't wake you up
[1:26:13] nothing will
[1:26:14] but you see people are you have to be
[1:26:17] motivated by love or even that
[1:26:19] it's not going to bring you to the house
[1:26:21] of god and it's and more than that it's
[1:26:23] not going to make you a real christian
[1:26:27] the brother you think he's a little
[1:26:28] wrong with the sister say lord don't
[1:26:30] let me never have the root of bitterness
[1:26:32] spring up
[1:26:35] because it'll affect him and it'll take
[1:26:37] the christ right out of my life
[1:26:40] i've seen preachers and i would never
[1:26:43] de-christianize the preacher because you
[1:26:44] don't know what he's been through
[1:26:47] but i've seen preachers that the christ
[1:26:48] was gone from their lives
[1:26:51] and they stand in the pulpit with a root
[1:26:53] of bitterness
[1:26:55] god help me never to do that yes amen
[1:26:58] but it may be easier for me to do than
[1:27:00] anyone else here
[1:27:02] you understand because of the position
[1:27:04] how satan attacks that
[1:27:06] and because you deal with people all the
[1:27:07] time
[1:27:09] brother branham calls it the poison
[1:27:11] acids
[1:27:13] if you could imagine two more worse
[1:27:15] things that you could have in your body
[1:27:17] the poison acids of malice
[1:27:20] and jealousy and hatred and it'll come
[1:27:23] and it'll affect your face it'll affect
[1:27:24] your attitude
[1:27:25] it'll affect your outlook
[1:27:28] it'll make you think everybody's against
[1:27:30] you
[1:27:34] it'll it'll make you lash out from the
[1:27:37] pulpit or from the pew or from the car
[1:27:39] or at the dinner table it'll make you
[1:27:42] lash out at the preacher it'll make you
[1:27:43] lash out of the congregation
[1:27:45] why because it's poison acids
[1:27:48] malice and jealousy and hatred
[1:27:51] so that will just take the holy spirit
[1:27:53] right away from you
[1:27:56] it will run him from the tabernacle here
[1:27:58] it'll kill the spirit of god or drive it
[1:28:00] away from here
[1:28:01] it'll hurt your pastor it'll do
[1:28:03] everything see
[1:28:04] he said don't you do that very man
[1:28:08] but here's what he said to do you just
[1:28:10] waxed that much closer today
[1:28:12] together don't you realize this is the
[1:28:13] same prophet that said those other
[1:28:15] things
[1:28:17] said thus the authority said if it
[1:28:18] doesn't come to pass he said i'm a false
[1:28:20] prophet and here it is today
[1:28:24] coming to pass just like he said it
[1:28:26] would see you just wax that much closer
[1:28:29] together
[1:28:30] same prophet take the buckle
[1:28:34] if there's a testimony on the internet i
[1:28:36] believe his brother cleveland talks
[1:28:37] about
[1:28:38] brother brown was referencing the
[1:28:39] testimony that he gave he had a vision
[1:28:41] about the buckle
[1:28:43] and how they would draw up he said that
[1:28:45] was tightening up to the word of god
[1:28:47] but branham gave him the interpretation
[1:28:48] of it he said take the buckle as the
[1:28:50] brother testified a minister here the
[1:28:52] other night by having a buckle
[1:28:54] seeing it in a vision he said just that
[1:28:55] buckles on the whole armor of god
[1:28:59] buckle it on amen just pull her on
[1:29:02] tighten up tighten up there's something
[1:29:06] loose tighten it up
[1:29:08] what you doing you get a rattle in your
[1:29:10] car you're driving down the road and
[1:29:11] something's rattling somewhere
[1:29:12] what does it need it needs tightening up
[1:29:16] needs some tightening up somebody needs
[1:29:17] to get a wrench out begin to tighten it
[1:29:19] up or that we would let the holy spirit
[1:29:21] tonight begin to tighten us up
[1:29:22] we're at the end he said because we're
[1:29:25] at the end amen we ought to come that
[1:29:26] much closer together
[1:29:28] tighten up move right up close to one
[1:29:31] another
[1:29:34] you see what it's done in the natural in
[1:29:36] this hour and we you have to do what you
[1:29:38] have to do
[1:29:39] i don't believe in just flaunting the
[1:29:41] rules but look
[1:29:42] everybody's distancing everybody's
[1:29:45] distancing but watch what's happening in
[1:29:47] the spiritual it's been happening a
[1:29:48] while
[1:29:49] spiritually everybody's distancing
[1:29:53] everything's virtual but a prophet of
[1:29:56] god spoke and said
[1:29:57] these things will happen and he said
[1:29:58] we're at the end time just pull her on
[1:30:01] tighten up move right up close to one
[1:30:03] another
[1:30:05] you don't want to get too close i'll
[1:30:06] spit on you but
[1:30:08] talk nice about one another thank you
[1:30:11] brother
[1:30:13] say nice things about one another can we
[1:30:15] could we do that
[1:30:16] you say well that's not very deep
[1:30:18] brother ben but don't you realize that's
[1:30:20] how we tighten up
[1:30:21] we know where we are we know who we are
[1:30:24] we're we know
[1:30:24] in whom we have believe it we know that
[1:30:26] we're predestined we know all these
[1:30:28] things
[1:30:28] but tighten up talk nice about one
[1:30:31] another when you tighten up you don't
[1:30:33] get more grouchy
[1:30:35] that's legalism when you tighten up and
[1:30:38] and
[1:30:38] and everybody seems bad to you and
[1:30:40] you're always talking bad about somebody
[1:30:42] know

[1:30:45] nice about one another
