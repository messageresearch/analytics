[38:26] Because we're redeemed.

[44:33] our God is [music] tremendous.
[44:36] Hallelujah.
[44:38] Oh, he goes through the fire. Why don't
[44:40] we worship him a little bit this
[44:42] morning, church? [music] He's
[44:43] tremendous.
[44:45] Hallelujah.
[44:47] His angels [music] to guide me.

[45:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Is he able?
[45:22] Hey, may you just stay in your position
[45:24] and watch the miraculous come into
[45:27] action. [music] Amen. That's all the
[45:28] music. You can be seated for just a
[45:30] moment this morning as we prepare to go
[45:34] into the service. I uh mentioned last
[45:37] week, Brother Bill Whiteamp is retiring
[45:39] from being a trustee. And brother Bill,
[45:42] I got you something. I just wanted to
[45:43] give that to you. Come on up, brother
[45:44] Bill, if you would.
[45:46] We sure appreciate Brother Bill. and I
[45:48] know he's made a sacrifice to serve over
[45:50] the years and thankful for the other
[45:52] brothers that have stepped up. God bless
[45:54] you, brother Bill. We love you with all
[45:55] of our hearts.
[45:57] [applause]
[46:00] &gt;&gt; Thank you, brother Bill.
[46:02] [applause]
[46:04] Amen. Don't you love the Lord this
[46:06] morning?
[46:07] &gt;&gt; Oh, isn't he good to us?
[46:10] &gt;&gt; I I just feel energized by his presence
[46:12] this morning.
[46:14] &gt;&gt; Believe he's here. whatever you have
[46:15] need of this morning. I believe he's
[46:17] able to meet that need. Let's stand
[46:19] together once again. It's hard to have
[46:20] you up and down, but let's just approach
[46:23] him in prayer this morning. If you have
[46:25] a need, would you slip it up to him by
[46:27] way of uplifted hand? God sees every
[46:29] need. He knows every heart. Heavenly
[46:32] Father, we're so grateful to be your
[46:34] children today. Lord, you are awesome.
[46:39] You are all powerful. There's nothing
[46:42] that you can't do. Lord, if we can just
[46:45] stay in our position and watch you do
[46:47] what you do. Lord, I pray you'd grant it
[46:50] this morning. Help us to do that. Help
[46:52] us to believe, Lord, for what we have
[46:54] need of, God. I don't know what these
[46:56] needs are represented by uplifted hand,
[46:59] but you do. And I pray, God, that you'd
[47:01] meet those needs. Touch every heart.
[47:04] Lord, my heart this morning is in need
[47:06] of a touch. Lord, as we go through the
[47:08] week, many times we we we we gain, Lord,
[47:12] a little bit of separation, it seems
[47:14] like between us and and you. We don't
[47:16] want that, Lord. We we want to be just
[47:18] right up close to you. We want to be
[47:21] right with there with you. You said
[47:22] you'd never leave us, never forsake us.
[47:24] So, Lord, we want to stay right with
[47:26] your word, right with your spirit. I
[47:28] pray you'd grant it, Lord. Bless these
[47:30] people, heal the sick, touch everyone.
[47:32] We pray in Jesus name. Amen. God bless
[47:34] you this morning. Turn with me to John
[47:37] chapter 5. The book of John chapter 5. I
[47:40] want to talk to you this morning about
[47:42] something that kind of keyed off of
[47:45] something we talked about on Wednesday
[47:46] night. We preached on the God that was
[47:48] rich in mercy. God had made a provision.
[47:51] One of the things that God made a
[47:52] provision for healing. One of the ways
[47:55] that he made provision was the pool of
[47:57] Bethesda. That story is told in John
[48:00] chapter 5. John 5:1 [snorts]
[48:03] says, "After this, there was a feast of
[48:04] the Jews, and Jesus went up to
[48:07] Jerusalem.
[48:08] There is at Jerusalem by the sheep
[48:10] market a pool, which is called in the
[48:12] Hebrew tongue Bethesda, having five
[48:14] porches.
[48:16] In these lay a great multitude of
[48:18] impotent folk, a blind halt, withered,
[48:22] waiting for the moving of the water. For
[48:26] an angel went down at a certain season
[48:28] into the pool, and troubled the water.
[48:31] Whosoever then first, after the
[48:33] troubling of the water, stepped in, was
[48:35] made a whole of whatsoever disease he
[48:38] had.
[48:39] And a certain man was there, which had
[48:41] an infirmity, 30 and 8 years.
[48:45] When Jesus saw him lie and knew that he
[48:47] had been now a long time in that case,
[48:51] he saith unto him, "Wilt thou be made
[48:55] whole?"
[48:56] In other words, do do you want revival?
[48:58] Do do you want to be whole? You want to
[49:00] be well? I want to use that as my text
[49:02] this morning. Do you want revival? God
[49:04] bless you. You can be seated.
[49:10] The story tells us of a man who who laid
[49:13] there. I don't know if he laid there the
[49:15] whole 38 years, but he might have by a
[49:18] pool of disappointment.
[49:21] Every time he got up to go to the pool,
[49:23] somebody bigger, stronger, faster got
[49:26] there ahead of him.
[49:28] &gt;&gt; He was unable to to alleviate his
[49:31] condition. Whatever it was wasn't wasn't
[49:34] mortal. It wasn't fatal, but he he just
[49:36] continued with it. He just couldn't get
[49:39] rid of it. And he he couldn't go about
[49:42] his normal life. and he just couldn't
[49:44] seem to get his healing. So, he was just
[49:46] continuing by the pool of Bethesda. That
[49:50] condition he waited for revival. The
[49:53] pool of Bethesda was a a pool that they
[49:56] had made where there was a spring and
[49:59] there it was a great pool in places. It
[50:01] was 40 foot deep. You can actually go
[50:03] visit it in Jerusalem today. It had five
[50:06] porches alongside of it. the they were
[50:09] covered roofs to cover the people as
[50:12] they would lay there waiting on the
[50:14] moving of the water and and there was
[50:16] maybe a thousand people under each
[50:18] porch. It was very very many people that
[50:20] waited and and so you can imagine in in
[50:23] the crush of the crowd to get down to
[50:25] the water. You had to be first.
[50:27] So you had to I don't know what they did
[50:29] to to get near the water, but I'm sure
[50:32] people paid for it. People begged,
[50:34] borrowed, stole, whatever they had to do
[50:37] to try to get near the water for a
[50:40] chance. And they didn't know when the
[50:42] water would be troubled, but they waited
[50:44] on it. They waited on it to happen.
[50:47] I want to ask you a question this
[50:49] morning. Why did the man lay by the pool
[50:52] of Bethesda when Jesus was already in
[50:56] the land?
[50:58] Why did he lay there? [crying]
[51:00] it. You know, it's either because he
[51:02] didn't know or didn't recognize
[51:06] that Jesus was the answer to his
[51:09] problem.
[51:11] &gt;&gt; Jesus was the revival that he needed.
[51:14] &gt;&gt; It don't get any deeper than this this
[51:16] morning, church. So, just hang with me.
[51:18] But Jesus was actually the one that he
[51:20] needed to pass by his way.
[51:23] &gt;&gt; But he didn't go to the meeting where
[51:25] Jesus was. He understood he waited by
[51:28] the pool and he must not have recognized
[51:31] the presence of the word among the
[51:34] people or he would have actually gone to
[51:38] him and asked him to heal him. Brother
[51:40] Brandham says this. He said, "Oh, the
[51:42] greatest pleasure I know of is to pray
[51:46] until I can realize that I'm in the
[51:48] presence of God and recognize it.
[51:51] Recognize it." So to be able in that
[51:53] moment when you know you've broken
[51:55] through in that moment when you know
[51:57] that he's with you in that moment when
[51:59] you know that that that there's
[52:00] something in the service there's a
[52:02] presence there with you maybe by your
[52:04] hospital bed maybe maybe when you're
[52:06] worried about things when you struggling
[52:08] in your life and it's in that moment you
[52:11] realize there's somebody else there
[52:13] you're not alone. Have you ever felt
[52:14] like that and to be able to recognize
[52:16] that it's him that does it. It's him
[52:18] that's there to recognize his presence.
[52:21] He said, "I think that ought to be the
[52:24] thrill of the church
[52:26] &gt;&gt; is the presence of the Holy Spirit."
[52:29] &gt;&gt; Oh, I think we've been seeking our
[52:31] thrills too cheaply.
[52:33] &gt;&gt; As CS Lewis said, he said, "We're like
[52:35] little children playing in the mud, and
[52:37] we don't recognize the importance of of
[52:40] getting away and going on vacation." He
[52:42] said, "Because children are just happy
[52:44] playing with the mud, like the person
[52:45] who who took the wrapping paper and
[52:47] threw away the gift." We we don't
[52:49] recognize it's not that our desires are
[52:52] too strong for things of the world, but
[52:54] our desire is too weak for the things of
[52:56] God.
[52:58] &gt;&gt; We don't really recognize how much we
[53:00] need his presence.
[53:02] &gt;&gt; He didn't recognize his presence among
[53:04] him among them or he would have went
[53:06] looking for him.
[53:07] &gt;&gt; But we know he said that's the thrill of
[53:09] the church is the presence of the Holy
[53:11] Spirit. See the God that made the
[53:13] promise standing among us. Feel his
[53:16] presence. See his word. See it
[53:18] vindicated. He said it ought to give
[53:20] faith to make cripples walk and and
[53:22] blind see and deaf hear and dumb speak.
[53:24] Don't you realize that's what brother
[53:26] Brandham's ministry was? He said my
[53:28] ministry is to declare that he is here.
[53:31] &gt;&gt; That the God of the heavens is on the
[53:33] earth again. That he's not dead in a
[53:35] tomb. He's not in Jerusalem. He's not
[53:37] dead. He's not he's not he's not didn't
[53:40] stay there. It's not an Eastern
[53:42] religion. It's not a religion of 2,000
[53:44] years ago. But the God of today, the
[53:47] same God who walked the shores of
[53:48] Galilee is right here this morning.
[53:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:54] Something had changed,
[53:56] &gt;&gt; but the man didn't recognize it. Now, if
[53:59] you suppose that the man had laid there
[54:01] ever since he had gotten sick,
[54:04] maybe he was 60 years old and at 22 he
[54:08] come down with this disease
[54:10] and he laid there and and he went he
[54:13] knew this was a place where healing was
[54:16] &gt;&gt; and so he was in that condition waiting
[54:19] on a revival.
[54:22] And I don't know how many times that
[54:23] I've talked to people and they said,
[54:25] "Brother Ben, we're just waiting on
[54:27] revival." waiting on revival in the
[54:30] church. Waiting on revival in our home.
[54:34] Waiting on revival in our marriage. Come
[54:36] on, church. We're just waiting on a
[54:39] revival. And the thing is, the reason he
[54:42] was waiting is because he didn't
[54:44] recognize the revival that was already
[54:46] there. Brother Brandham said the reason
[54:47] they were crying out for a revival in
[54:49] his time. Listen, brother Brandham was
[54:51] on the earth
[54:53] &gt;&gt; and they were crying out and saying, "We
[54:55] need a prophet in our time. Come on.
[54:57] &gt;&gt; We need a prophet to return. He said
[54:59] they failed to recognize the awakening
[55:02] of the bride.
[55:03] &gt;&gt; They failed to recognize it. So this man
[55:06] while he lay there failed by the trip to
[55:08] recognize that Christ was already among
[55:10] the people. That he was already healing
[55:12] the sick. He was already begun his
[55:14] ministry. He wasn't just a baby in a
[55:16] manger. The word had been born, but the
[55:19] word had also come to maturity during
[55:21] the time that he laid there. Think about
[55:23] that for a moment. He had during the
[55:25] time he had been sick.
[55:26] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[55:27] &gt;&gt; Oh, God. God had actually been born in
[55:31] flesh.
[55:32] &gt;&gt; Emmanuel, God with us.
[55:34] &gt;&gt; And during the Oh, come on. While you
[55:36] were waiting on revival, revival was
[55:38] already there. While you were waiting on
[55:40] healing, healing was already there. It's
[55:42] right there by you.
[55:43] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[55:46] &gt;&gt; He was waiting on a moving of the
[55:48] waters, right? on a revival in the area
[55:52] that he was in. Waiting on a revival in
[55:56] the church
[55:57] &gt;&gt; that he was in.
[55:58] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[55:59] &gt;&gt; And and there's a certain amount of that
[56:02] that becomes an excuse because
[56:05] &gt;&gt; it's like, well, I'm sick, but everybody
[56:07] else is sick, too. Or I'm And there's
[56:11] nothing no there's no shame in being
[56:13] sick, but we know a healer,
[56:16] &gt;&gt; right? We we believe we are healed. Do
[56:18] you believe that today?
[56:20] &gt;&gt; But many times we wait on something to
[56:22] happen. Just waiting on a move of the
[56:24] spirit so that God can begin. You know,
[56:27] that's what they did in Pentecost. They
[56:28] waited on the Holy Spirit. They tried.
[56:31] Brother Brandham taught us we don't have
[56:32] to tarry anymore.
[56:34] &gt;&gt; They tried in the upper room, but we
[56:36] don't have to tar anymore.
[56:39] &gt;&gt; You young people stay with me. I know
[56:40] some of y'all were had a busy day
[56:42] yesterday, but just stay with me now.
[56:45] You know, you're we're waiting many
[56:48] times on camp to come.
[56:50] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[56:51] &gt;&gt; Right. And we believe in sending our
[56:53] kids to camp. We want them to associate
[56:55] with Christians.
[56:56] &gt;&gt; We want them to have a revival. We want
[56:58] them to be in that atmosphere.
[57:00] &gt;&gt; Listen, but but the revival is right
[57:02] here,
[57:04] &gt;&gt; right?
[57:04] &gt;&gt; The the the word has been manifested by
[57:06] you.
[57:08] &gt;&gt; And the manifested word has been
[57:10] identified as the lamb.
[57:12] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[57:13] &gt;&gt; Right. the fullness of the atonement.
[57:15] So, Brother Brandham taught us as we
[57:17] were talking about God rich in mercy. He
[57:18] taught us that the God who was rich in
[57:20] mercy, he said provided a a brass
[57:22] serpent, you remember, and they could
[57:24] look and live. He also provided a pool
[57:26] of Bethesda, they could wait there for
[57:28] the moving of the water, it was God rich
[57:30] in mercy. He said when they made an idol
[57:32] out of the brass serpent, he provided
[57:34] another way for them.
[57:35] &gt;&gt; But don't you realize that we're not
[57:37] just waiting on that to happen because
[57:40] something changed when Jesus came? You
[57:42] realize once Jesus stepped onto the
[57:44] scene and begun his ministry, that pool
[57:46] never moved again.
[57:49] &gt;&gt; There's no record in history that the
[57:50] angel ever troubled the water again
[57:53] because the angel that troubled the
[57:54] water had come in flesh.
[57:58] &gt;&gt; Right? The brass serpent or the pole,
[58:00] sin was judged in his body.
[58:03] &gt;&gt; So the fullness had come and it had been
[58:05] identified by John in John chapter 1 and
[58:08] verse 29. And it says, "The next day
[58:09] John seeth Jesus coming unto him and
[58:11] saith, Behold who?" The lamb.
[58:14] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[58:15] &gt;&gt; The lamb.
[58:17] &gt;&gt; The the those five porches that were
[58:20] there, the pool of Bethesda, they were
[58:22] surrounding that pool, but the way you
[58:25] got to it was through the sheep gate.
[58:27] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[58:27] &gt;&gt; Remember the scripture said it was by
[58:29] the sheep market.
[58:30] &gt;&gt; That's where they brought the lambs in
[58:32] &gt;&gt; to be offered for a sacrifice. And the
[58:35] lamb walked through the sheep gate. the
[58:38] atonement for healing and for salvation
[58:40] come [screaming] through the gate.
[58:41] Hallelujah. And John said, "Behold the
[58:44] lamb of God which taketh away the sin of
[58:47] the world."
[58:48] &gt;&gt; He's not a temporary lamb. He's not a
[58:50] lamb when you feel good.
[58:52] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[58:52] &gt;&gt; Come on, church. He's not a lamb when
[58:54] [screaming] you're well. But he's a lamb
[58:55] when you're sick. He's a lamb when
[58:56] you're in trouble. He's a lamb when you
[58:58] don't have any money. He's a lamb when
[59:00] you're not doing good. Come on, church.
[59:01] He's still the lamb. How many believe
[59:03] he's the lamb today? He is the perfect
[59:06] atonement.
[59:09] &gt;&gt; Oh, do you want revival this morning? He
[59:11] is our revival.
[59:14] &gt;&gt; Our revival is the fullness of the word
[59:16] manifested.
[59:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[59:21] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[59:22] &gt;&gt; Good.
[59:24] &gt;&gt; He said, "This is he of whom I said,
[59:25] after me cometh the man which is
[59:27] preferred before me, for he was before
[59:30] me." Yeah.
[59:31] &gt;&gt; Again, the next day after John stood in
[59:33] two of his disciples and looking upon
[59:34] Jesus as he walked, he saith, "Behold
[59:37] the lamb of God." He didn't quit saying
[59:40] it.
[59:41] &gt;&gt; He just kept telling them, "This is
[59:43] him."
[59:43] &gt;&gt; Right?
[59:45] &gt;&gt; This is him. You see, things had changed
[59:49] while he was laying there.
[59:50] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[59:51] &gt;&gt; Jesus began his ministry at a wedding
[59:53] ceremony in John chapter 2. He talked
[59:57] about a wedding ceremony. And it's kind
[59:59] of an odd place to begin his ministry.
[1:00:00] He turned water into wine.
[1:00:02] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:00:03] &gt;&gt; What was it? Brought stimulation of
[1:00:05] revelation.
[1:00:07] &gt;&gt; The word had come.
[1:00:08] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:00:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:00:11] &gt;&gt; To to to attend a wedding.
[1:00:14] &gt;&gt; I believe there's been a wedding going
[1:00:15] on.
[1:00:16] &gt;&gt; The said we don't go to the w to the
[1:00:18] wedding. We go to the wedding supper.
[1:00:20] &gt;&gt; There's been a wedding going on. And so
[1:00:22] the word had come a and come to the
[1:00:24] wedding and the water was turned into
[1:00:26] wine and there was a stimulation of
[1:00:28] revelation and everybody was still
[1:00:31] sitting by the pool waiting on the angel
[1:00:33] to trouble the waters and the water's
[1:00:35] already been turned into wine.
[1:00:38] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. It was it was in John, the
[1:00:41] book of John, I believe it's in chapter
[1:00:42] 3 where Nicodemus came by night and was
[1:00:45] told you must be born again.
[1:00:49] &gt;&gt; What was it? The lamb was present. the
[1:00:51] full word.
[1:00:52] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:00:53] &gt;&gt; You don't have to remain the way that
[1:00:55] you are. Listen to me. You don't have to
[1:00:57] remain that way. I I know sometimes we
[1:00:59] we have this up and down relationship
[1:01:01] with the Lord and and we're in one day
[1:01:03] and out the next. And I know all of us
[1:01:05] struggle. We all live in a body of
[1:01:06] humiliation. We all live in flesh. But
[1:01:08] we can be an overcomer.
[1:01:11] &gt;&gt; We don't have to live the way that they
[1:01:13] lived even in denominational ages. Why
[1:01:15] does God call us to a a closer walk with
[1:01:18] him and a higher call of holiness here
[1:01:20] at the end time? Because the fullness of
[1:01:22] the word, the lamb has come to enable us
[1:01:25] to walk like that. Listen, Luther
[1:01:26] couldn't have walked like you walked.
[1:01:28] Wesley couldn't have walked. Though he
[1:01:29] had sanctification, but he couldn't have
[1:01:31] walked like you walked. But you can walk
[1:01:33] pleasing to the Lord, not because of
[1:01:35] your own effort, not because of
[1:01:37] legalism, but because the full lamb is
[1:01:39] coming to the picture.
[1:01:42] &gt;&gt; The fullness of the word is. Do you
[1:01:43] realize what the message of the hour is
[1:01:45] to us? It's not just a man's words, but
[1:01:47] it's the fullness of the atonement.
[1:01:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:01:54] &gt;&gt; And when the fullness is there, you
[1:01:56] don't have to keep the consciousness of
[1:01:57] sin.
[1:01:58] &gt;&gt; You don't have to keep the desire of the
[1:02:00] sin. That was the difference between the
[1:02:02] partial atonement and the full
[1:02:04] atonement. Under a partial atonement,
[1:02:06] you had to come back year by year and
[1:02:08] you could not be cleansed from the sin
[1:02:10] conscience. You couldn't be cleansed. Go
[1:02:11] read Hebrews. He said, he said it could
[1:02:13] not make the comer there and too
[1:02:15] perfect. But there come a lamb.
[1:02:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That could make somebody
[1:02:20] perfect. Maybe not in the eyes of man,
[1:02:22] but perfect in the eyes of God.
[1:02:27] &gt;&gt; You don't have to be up and down and in
[1:02:29] and out. And today you're a Christian
[1:02:30] and tomorrow you're not. And today
[1:02:32] you're doing good. And tomorrow you
[1:02:34] don't know if the word's right or not.
[1:02:35] Today you believe the message. Tomorrow
[1:02:36] you don't know if you believe the
[1:02:37] message or not. You can stay inside the
[1:02:39] Holy of Holies. The veil has been rent
[1:02:42] and the mercy seat has come into plain
[1:02:44] view. This is the fullness of the
[1:02:45] atonement.
[1:02:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:47] &gt;&gt; The lamb is present walking right among
[1:02:49] us.
[1:02:50] &gt;&gt; Oh, come on, church. We can be made
[1:02:52] whole.
[1:02:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:02:58] [gasps]
[1:02:59] &gt;&gt; He's struggling with something sinful in
[1:03:01] your life and you can be made whole.
[1:03:06] You don't have to remain like that.
[1:03:10] You can be made whole. You can feel the
[1:03:13] presence of God. Brother said, "A man
[1:03:14] that believes God can feel God, know
[1:03:16] God, know that he's there by faith, you
[1:03:19] know he's there, but you can actually
[1:03:21] feel him and know him. You can know him
[1:03:23] in a real way because the lamb has come
[1:03:26] in our day." John chapter 3 and 26.
[1:03:30] They came to John and said to him,
[1:03:31] "Rabbi, he that was with thee beyond
[1:03:34] Jordan, to whom thou beest witness,
[1:03:35] behold the same baptizest, all men come
[1:03:37] to him." And John answered and said, "A
[1:03:39] man can receive nothing except to be
[1:03:41] given him from heaven. You yourselves
[1:03:44] bear me witness that I said, I am not
[1:03:45] the Christ, but that I am sent before
[1:03:48] him. He that hath the bride is the
[1:03:51] bridegroom, but the friend of the
[1:03:53] bridegroom, which standeth and hearth
[1:03:55] him rejoicth greatly, because of the
[1:03:58] bridegroom's voice." [snorts]
[1:04:01] &gt;&gt; This my joy therefore is fulfilled. He
[1:04:05] said, "He must increase, but I must
[1:04:08] decrease."
[1:04:09] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:04:10] &gt;&gt; The brand said, "John the Baptist come
[1:04:11] on as a sign." He was a prophet. He was
[1:04:13] a prophet. Sign come on the earth. They
[1:04:15] knew when he'd come on the Messiah would
[1:04:18] speak after him. It had to be cuz get
[1:04:21] the elected.
[1:04:22] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:04:23] &gt;&gt; All right. So, there had to be a sign
[1:04:25] and then a voice calling the elect after
[1:04:28] the sign.
[1:04:29] &gt;&gt; Yeah. He said John calling out the
[1:04:31] elected and give it over to Christ when
[1:04:32] he come swapped his his church. I love
[1:04:35] that. Swapped his church and become
[1:04:37] Christ's church.
[1:04:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Said I must decrease. He
[1:04:42] must increase because he said I'm just
[1:04:44] the voice of him crying in the
[1:04:46] wilderness, prepare the way for the
[1:04:49] Lord.
[1:04:50] &gt;&gt; And Jesus come the same way. He said
[1:04:52] gets the elected ready to hear the voice
[1:04:53] of God. He said that's what the
[1:04:55] prophetic sign is. Yes.
[1:04:58] &gt;&gt; That's why John came. John was a sign to
[1:05:00] the world that here come the messenger
[1:05:02] preparing then there must be a Messiah
[1:05:05] after him.
[1:05:07] &gt;&gt; Are you with me so far?
[1:05:09] &gt;&gt; So he said if if you follow these
[1:05:10] messages he said get the elected ready.
[1:05:13] He said not the others will never hear
[1:05:14] it. It's the elected that's called.
[1:05:17] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:05:18] &gt;&gt; Again he said 400 years Israel without a
[1:05:21] prophet. The churches have got so
[1:05:22] twisted up. And then here come John on
[1:05:24] the scene. John was the prophet. a sign
[1:05:26] that the Messiah was going to speak
[1:05:27] after him. He said, "Watch." Because
[1:05:29] Malachi 3 said, "I'll send my messenger
[1:05:31] before my face to prepare the way,
[1:05:33] prepare the people." Look at John. No
[1:05:34] selfishness in him. He never took any
[1:05:36] glory. They tried to call him the
[1:05:38] Messiah. But he said, "I'm not worthy to
[1:05:39] loose his shoes." But as soon as Jesus
[1:05:42] appeared, he had a sign, a pillar of
[1:05:44] fire, a light above him like a dove come
[1:05:46] down, a voice saying, "This is my
[1:05:47] beloved son in whom I'm well pleased."
[1:05:50] Notice in John immediately said, "He
[1:05:51] must increase, I must decrease." He
[1:05:54] presented the church to Christ.
[1:05:56] &gt;&gt; He said, "We are told in the last days
[1:05:58] that will repeat again." There's going
[1:06:01] to be a message come forth. I believe we
[1:06:03] have it today. Aren't you glad for the
[1:06:05] message of the hour? There's going to be
[1:06:06] a message come forth that'll introduce
[1:06:08] the Messiah to the people and it'll be
[1:06:10] in such a way they'll stand dumbfounded
[1:06:12] like they did then. He said he promised
[1:06:14] it.
[1:06:15] &gt;&gt; Oh, church, do we recognize where we're
[1:06:17] living?
[1:06:18] &gt;&gt; Do we recognize what day and what hour
[1:06:20] we're living in?
[1:06:22] Oh my
[1:06:24] &gt;&gt; look here was the fullness of the word.
[1:06:28] The one who said, "I am the God
[1:06:32] &gt;&gt; that healeth thee,
[1:06:34] &gt;&gt; put shoes on,
[1:06:39] &gt;&gt; had a robe on,
[1:06:41] &gt;&gt; like any other man,
[1:06:43] &gt;&gt; a staff in his hand,
[1:06:45] &gt;&gt; like any other man. Come walking like
[1:06:47] any other man. He looked like just
[1:06:49] another man." Brother said, "He didn't
[1:06:50] look like a leader. He looked just like
[1:06:53] a normal man." and he come walking
[1:06:55] towards that pool of Bethesda, the one
[1:06:58] who said, "I am the God
[1:07:01] &gt;&gt; that heal thee." We're not talking about
[1:07:02] a second person or a third person. He is
[1:07:05] the person.
[1:07:08] &gt;&gt; Come on, church. No wonder it was such a
[1:07:10] He said it's an easy thing to say you're
[1:07:13] healed. He said, but also to say your
[1:07:14] sins are forgiven.
[1:07:16] &gt;&gt; Right? He was the atonement. He was the
[1:07:18] lamb that takes away the sin of the
[1:07:21] world. And and if he the man could have
[1:07:23] only recognized who he was, he'd have
[1:07:25] come to him. But I'm so glad that when
[1:07:28] we don't recognize him, he still knows
[1:07:30] us.
[1:07:32] &gt;&gt; Oh, come on, church. When we fail to
[1:07:34] find him, he's still looking for us. We
[1:07:37] weren't looking for him. Brother
[1:07:38] Stewart, he came looking for me.
[1:07:41] &gt;&gt; And God with shoes on.
[1:07:43] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:07:44] &gt;&gt; God with [screaming] dust on his
[1:07:45] clothes.
[1:07:47] [laughter]
[1:07:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:07:48] &gt;&gt; Came down in the midst of all that mess.
[1:07:52] All those people who were there crying
[1:07:53] out for healing and come to the elected
[1:07:56] and said, "Do you want a revival? Do you
[1:07:58] want to be well? Here I am."
[1:07:59] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:08:04] &gt;&gt; Do we recognize where we're living? See,
[1:08:07] what had happened was the bridegroom
[1:08:09] revival was in the land.
[1:08:10] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:08:12] &gt;&gt; Right. But a prophet declared that the
[1:08:13] bride revival is in the land.
[1:08:16] &gt;&gt; The awakening of the bride. He even said
[1:08:18] an infant bride was on the earth. I
[1:08:21] believe today we see the bride being
[1:08:23] manifested.
[1:08:25] And what are we talking about? We're
[1:08:26] talking about a word in its fullness.
[1:08:29] &gt;&gt; So today though, what do people do? They
[1:08:32] still gather around pools,
[1:08:37] &gt;&gt; right? Which is a place where you store
[1:08:39] up water.
[1:08:40] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:08:41] &gt;&gt; To keep it from getting away. And so
[1:08:43] they make up doctrinal pools.
[1:08:45] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:08:46] &gt;&gt; And gather around them. And they each
[1:08:49] one have a pool and one calls it this
[1:08:51] doctrine or that doctrine that I won't
[1:08:53] name doctrines because if I got started
[1:08:54] I'd never stop
[1:08:57] and people believe anything.
[1:08:59] &gt;&gt; I heard one time there was a group of
[1:09:00] people I think our brother brother Ivy
[1:09:03] mentioned it one time and I went and
[1:09:04] looked it up. There's actually a tribe
[1:09:06] that worshiped snails.
[1:09:09] &gt;&gt; If you can worship a snail, you can
[1:09:10] worship anything.
[1:09:15] &gt;&gt; Just cuz you made it up don't make it
[1:09:17] real.
[1:09:18] Right.
[1:09:21] &gt;&gt; Just cuz you believe it don't make it
[1:09:22] right.
[1:09:23] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:09:24] &gt;&gt; But the fullness of the word is coming
[1:09:26] our day.
[1:09:27] &gt;&gt; But people had their pools. They had
[1:09:29] their little pools they built and and
[1:09:30] their little ideas and their their
[1:09:32] conception of who Christ was and what
[1:09:34] what he did and and all of these things.
[1:09:36] They had their pool, the pool of
[1:09:38] Bethesda. and and and they were there
[1:09:41] waiting on a revival, not realizing that
[1:09:43] the revival was over
[1:09:46] the sweeping revival.
[1:09:47] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:09:48] &gt;&gt; Right. The angel would never trouble the
[1:09:50] water again.
[1:09:51] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:09:52] &gt;&gt; Because the angel had come, the fullness
[1:09:55] had come to be the healer, to be the
[1:09:58] revival.
[1:10:00] And and that challenges us as
[1:10:02] individuals
[1:10:03] &gt;&gt; because look, we can't get distracted by
[1:10:06] denominational pools,
[1:10:09] &gt;&gt; educational pools,
[1:10:11] &gt;&gt; philosophical pools,
[1:10:14] &gt;&gt; podcasts,
[1:10:16] &gt;&gt; entertainment,
[1:10:17] &gt;&gt; Hollywood,
[1:10:18] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:10:18] &gt;&gt; Now, look, I'm not preaching against
[1:10:20] those things. I'm saying don't be
[1:10:21] distracted by them.
[1:10:22] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:10:23] &gt;&gt; Fox News or CNN or Democrats or
[1:10:26] Republicans and everybody's all in an
[1:10:27] uproar about all these things. Don't get
[1:10:29] distracted. Get to looking at your pool.
[1:10:31] Remember, the full word is right here
[1:10:33] among us,
[1:10:36] &gt;&gt; what are those things? They're false
[1:10:38] revivals.
[1:10:39] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:10:41] &gt;&gt; Right. False revivals offering a glimmer
[1:10:43] of wholeness.
[1:10:45] &gt;&gt; If you'll do this, you can be made
[1:10:47] whole. If you'll jump through these
[1:10:50] hoops and believe this doctrine, you can
[1:10:52] be made whole.
[1:10:53] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:10:54] &gt;&gt; If you'll go to this church, you can be
[1:10:56] made whole. Listen, it's it's a
[1:10:58] denominational pool.
[1:11:01] &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? You don't have to
[1:11:02] go to this church to be made a whole.
[1:11:04] &gt;&gt; What you got to do is recognize who's
[1:11:06] standing by you.
[1:11:10] &gt;&gt; You don't have to live in Hardy,
[1:11:11] Arkansas to be made whole. You don't
[1:11:13] have to say, you don't have to know who
[1:11:14] Ben Puit is to be made whole. You don't
[1:11:16] have to know who Donnie Reagan is or Tim
[1:11:18] Pru or anybody else or Brother Joel or
[1:11:20] Brother Stewart. You got to know him.
[1:11:23] &gt;&gt; Come on, church. You got to know him.
[1:11:25] And the only way you can know him in his
[1:11:26] fullness is by the word of the hour.
[1:11:31] &gt;&gt; False revival offering a glimmer of
[1:11:33] wholeness
[1:11:35] like a carrot on a stick.
[1:11:37] &gt;&gt; But no matter how many videos you look
[1:11:39] at, it'll never give full satisfaction.
[1:11:43] &gt;&gt; Hear me today. No matter how many
[1:11:46] &gt;&gt; relationships you pursue,
[1:11:51] &gt;&gt; it'll never give full satisfaction.
[1:11:53] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:11:55] No, no matter how much good food you
[1:11:58] have or bad food,
[1:12:01] it'll never give full satisfaction.
[1:12:04] No matter how much you entertain
[1:12:06] yourself,
[1:12:09] you know, I I'm a human being, too. I
[1:12:12] like entertaining things. I like being
[1:12:15] entertained. All of us do. But we don't
[1:12:17] come to church to be entertained.
[1:12:19] &gt;&gt; We come for a visit with the word who we
[1:12:22] know is already here. Yes,
[1:12:23] &gt;&gt; we come with a for a visit with him.
[1:12:26] &gt;&gt; And so when we come, there's nothing
[1:12:28] that entertains my soul like his
[1:12:30] presence.
[1:12:31] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:12:32] &gt;&gt; Like being in his presence. And I wonder
[1:12:34] if there's a desire there. If there's
[1:12:36] something in your heart, I'm taking my
[1:12:37] time this morning, but I really want to
[1:12:39] get this across to you. If there's
[1:12:40] something in your heart that says,
[1:12:41] "Lord, I just need you. I just want you
[1:12:44] to be here. I got a desire in my heart.
[1:12:46] I want to be well. I want to be whole. I
[1:12:48] want to have that satisfaction that only
[1:12:50] you can provide." Listen church. You
[1:12:52] say, "Well, I have the Holy Ghost." Yes,
[1:12:53] but you need filling after refilling
[1:12:55] after refilling. I need refilling. A
[1:12:58] refilling of the Holy Ghost. Every one
[1:12:59] of us do. Why do we come back to the
[1:13:01] house of God? We want to be refilled. We
[1:13:03] want to be ready. We want to be We want
[1:13:05] to be somebody he can work through. We
[1:13:07] want to be somebody he can speak
[1:13:08] through. And so, what do we do? We don't
[1:13:11] go to a pool, a disappointing pool. We
[1:13:13] don't go to a denomination. We go to the
[1:13:16] word. And the word is our source of
[1:13:18] information. The word is our source of
[1:13:20] entertainment.
[1:13:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:13:26] &gt;&gt; When we believe the word in his
[1:13:27] fullness, his presence comes.
[1:13:34] &gt;&gt; A woman at the well
[1:13:36] had been given water.
[1:13:38] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:13:39] &gt;&gt; And she would never thirst again.
[1:13:42] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:13:44] &gt;&gt; I hope you hear me this morning. I
[1:13:45] believe the Lord is speaking to somebody
[1:13:46] this morning. I know he's speaking to my
[1:13:48] heart.
[1:13:51] &gt;&gt; That's the water that I want. That's the
[1:13:53] water the man needed. But he didn't
[1:13:55] recognize Jesus was in the land.
[1:13:58] &gt;&gt; But Jesus had a need to go by Samaria
[1:14:00] cuz she didn't recognize it either until
[1:14:01] he showed her the sign of the Messiah.
[1:14:05] &gt;&gt; Revealed the secret of her heart. Then
[1:14:07] she knew this must be the one.
[1:14:10] Hallelujah.
[1:14:12] This is the prophet. This is the
[1:14:13] Messiah.
[1:14:16] This was the word revival. It was the
[1:14:18] word himself bringing. See, people think
[1:14:21] that the word revival
[1:14:23] is the a revival without emotion. That's
[1:14:25] not what it is at all.
[1:14:27] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:14:28] &gt;&gt; A word revival is not a revival without
[1:14:30] emotion. A word revival is a revival of
[1:14:32] him.
[1:14:33] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:14:34] &gt;&gt; Who is the word,
[1:14:35] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:14:36] &gt;&gt; Right. It's Christ moving among us.
[1:14:38] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:14:39] &gt;&gt; However he wants to move.
[1:14:41] However, if he wants to speak to us in
[1:14:43] the quietness of the word, if he wants
[1:14:44] to pour out his blessings on us, if he
[1:14:47] wants uh to if we want to shout or run
[1:14:49] or speak into whatever it is that he
[1:14:51] calls us to do, it won't be out of order
[1:14:53] if he's the one that inspires it.
[1:14:55] &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? And so, the word
[1:14:57] has got to come. That's what we want. We
[1:15:00] don't want just a dead letter, but we
[1:15:02] want the word. The word didn't come in
[1:15:04] dead letter. But Jesus didn't just
[1:15:06] didn't stand there and speak. He moved.
[1:15:09] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Right.
[1:15:11] &gt;&gt; He He spoke. He moved. He touched.
[1:15:14] &gt;&gt; He healed.
[1:15:16] &gt;&gt; He traveled. This word travels.
[1:15:18] &gt;&gt; It don't ain't just good at church. Come
[1:15:20] on. It ain't just good at your home.
[1:15:22] It's good at your work. It's good
[1:15:23] [screaming] everywhere. It'll keep your
[1:15:24] testimony.
[1:15:26] &gt;&gt; The bride revival is not just a revival
[1:15:28] of a moment. It's not a revival of a
[1:15:30] service. It's not a revival of a
[1:15:32] meeting, but it's a revival of the word.
[1:15:36] &gt;&gt; Good.
[1:15:39] Oh, I call it out to you today. Why
[1:15:41] don't we leave our pools of
[1:15:42] disappointment
[1:15:44] &gt;&gt; trying to figure everything out? We want
[1:15:46] to have it all figured out and then
[1:15:47] we'll come to him. No, leave that old
[1:15:49] pool of education.
[1:15:51] &gt;&gt; Come to the word.
[1:15:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Leave your pools of
[1:15:57] disappointment and hear the voice of the
[1:16:00] word crying out, "Do you want revival?
[1:16:04] Get up and walk.
[1:16:09] Hallelujah.
[1:16:10] You might get prayed for. Brother
[1:16:12] Brandon said that
[1:16:14] uh the Congressman Upshaw, he said he'd
[1:16:17] had gallons of oil poured on his head
[1:16:20] &gt;&gt; because of all the different brothers
[1:16:21] that had prayed for him. There's nothing
[1:16:22] wrong with that.
[1:16:24] &gt;&gt; But see, it had to come his time.
[1:16:26] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:16:27] &gt;&gt; God, the revelation of the word was
[1:16:29] there. And brother Brandon by a vision
[1:16:30] saw him walking.
[1:16:32] &gt;&gt; Yeah. And when he saw him walking, then
[1:16:34] all brother Upshaw had to do, all
[1:16:37] Congressman Upshaw had to do was obey
[1:16:39] the word.
[1:16:41] &gt;&gt; I hope you're hearing me today. Listen,
[1:16:43] you don't need some kind of weird
[1:16:44] sensation or something. All you need to
[1:16:46] do is obey the word. You need to do what
[1:16:48] the word says do. If the word says get
[1:16:50] up and walk, it's time to get up and
[1:16:52] walk.
[1:16:55] &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? Now, so John 5 and6
[1:17:01] tells us says when Jesus saw him lie
[1:17:05] and knew,
[1:17:07] how did he know the same God
[1:17:12] that spoke through a prophet in our day
[1:17:13] and said, "Your name is Miss Brown.
[1:17:15] You're sitting on the edge of your seat.
[1:17:18] Go home. You'll be you'll be healed of
[1:17:19] your sinus trouble." That little lady
[1:17:21] lived in West Plains. Told me her story.
[1:17:23] I know I've mentioned her many times,
[1:17:25] but there were many in this area that
[1:17:26] that that experienced that that a man
[1:17:29] that did not know them, they'd never
[1:17:30] met. They never put their name on a
[1:17:32] prayer card. But William Brandham stood
[1:17:34] there. Wasn't brother Brandham, but it
[1:17:35] was God speaking through a man. It was
[1:17:38] God borrowing a redeemed body to speak
[1:17:40] and tell us something. What was he
[1:17:42] telling us? I'm still God. I'm still the
[1:17:44] same yesterday, today, and forever.
[1:17:48] &gt;&gt; Jesus knew. Yes.
[1:17:50] &gt;&gt; Oh, don't you know he knows your
[1:17:52] situation.
[1:17:53] &gt;&gt; He knows what you're going through. He
[1:17:54] knows what you're crying about. He knows
[1:17:56] what you young people are suffering. He
[1:17:58] knows the the things that are in your
[1:18:00] heart that you're holding. You might as
[1:18:01] well surrender it to him. You might as
[1:18:03] well give it all up to him. Let him have
[1:18:05] it this morning. He already knows.
[1:18:10] &gt;&gt; He said he knew he'd been a long time
[1:18:13] &gt;&gt; in that case.
[1:18:15] And he said to him, "Wilt thou be made
[1:18:19] whole?"
[1:18:20] &gt;&gt; That's an odd question to ask, isn't it?
[1:18:24] Look how the man answers. The impotent
[1:18:25] man. I I love the way the Bible puts
[1:18:28] that. The man who had no ability to help
[1:18:31] himself,
[1:18:31] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:18:33] &gt;&gt; That was me.
[1:18:36] &gt;&gt; The man who had no ability
[1:18:39] &gt;&gt; to help himself, the impotent man
[1:18:42] answered,
[1:18:44] &gt;&gt; hallelujah.
[1:18:45] You can try to pull yourself up by your
[1:18:47] bootstraps all your life, but you're in
[1:18:49] the end when it comes to spiritual
[1:18:51] things, we're just impotent. We're not
[1:18:53] able.
[1:18:55] &gt;&gt; But he said, "Sir, I have no man." Now,
[1:18:58] watch what he's waiting for. He had seen
[1:19:01] perhaps in that time, you know, somebody
[1:19:03] go down and help their friend
[1:19:06] &gt;&gt; make it down to the water quickly. He'd
[1:19:09] seen
[1:19:11] evangelists come through,
[1:19:14] right, and hold a healing revival and
[1:19:16] people get healed. He'd seen service
[1:19:19] after service where a man
[1:19:22] helped somebody.
[1:19:24] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:19:25] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:19:26] &gt;&gt; So, what does he say? I have no man.
[1:19:30] &gt;&gt; I I would love to get down, but I have
[1:19:32] no man.
[1:19:34] &gt;&gt; Oh, I hope you get it this morning,
[1:19:35] church. I I would love to have a
[1:19:37] revival, but I'm waiting on the
[1:19:39] preacher.
[1:19:42] &gt;&gt; I'd love to have revival. [screaming]
[1:19:44] I'd love to be on fire for God. Boy, I
[1:19:45] love it when it always amazes me people
[1:19:47] that just love to see the church on fire
[1:19:49] and never get on fire themselves.
[1:19:52] &gt;&gt; Preach.
[1:19:52] &gt;&gt; I It's not enough. I don't want to be
[1:19:54] I've never been a person that just like
[1:19:55] to watch something. I want to
[1:19:56] participate in it.
[1:19:58] &gt;&gt; Oh, I don't want to just watch the
[1:19:59] church have revival. I don't want to
[1:20:01] just watch the young people have
[1:20:02] revival. Let the revival begin in me.
[1:20:06] Yes.
[1:20:06] &gt;&gt; He said, "I have no man."
[1:20:08] &gt;&gt; No man. What he didn't realize is that
[1:20:11] the age of men carrying you to a re
[1:20:13] revival is over.
[1:20:16] &gt;&gt; Hear me, church. The age of a man.
[1:20:18] Listen, I can't preach you into revival.
[1:20:20] The revival is already here.
[1:20:21] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:20:23] &gt;&gt; The age of man is over. The age of the
[1:20:25] word,
[1:20:26] &gt;&gt; yes,
[1:20:26] &gt;&gt; is here.
[1:20:28] &gt;&gt; And the word is asking the question this
[1:20:30] morning, wilt thou be made whole?
[1:20:35] Do you want to be well?
[1:20:37] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:20:38] &gt;&gt; It seems silly. And I've been in here
[1:20:40] for 38 years.
[1:20:43] You don't think I want to be well? You
[1:20:45] know, the man could have got offended,
[1:20:48] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:20:49] &gt;&gt; Haven't you seen me at church?
[1:20:51] &gt;&gt; Haven't you seen me at the altar?
[1:20:53] &gt;&gt; But it's a good question.
[1:20:55] &gt;&gt; Jesus knows the right questions to ask.
[1:20:58] &gt;&gt; Do you want to be well?
[1:21:00] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:21:01] &gt;&gt; Every one of us individually has got to
[1:21:02] answer that. Do you want revival?
[1:21:07] &gt;&gt; Cuz all of us need it
[1:21:09] &gt;&gt; from time to time. We need revival.
[1:21:12] &gt;&gt; You see, Jesus knew how long he had been
[1:21:15] there.
[1:21:16] &gt;&gt; So, he knew he'd been there. Maybe all
[1:21:18] 38 years. We don't know. But he'd been
[1:21:19] there a long time.
[1:21:22] Maybe he got used to it.
[1:21:25] &gt;&gt; He laid there and he just got used to
[1:21:27] the routine of seeing other people
[1:21:29] blessed.
[1:21:33] and brother so and so got blessed and
[1:21:35] sister so and so got blessed and the
[1:21:36] kids had a good time at camp and and
[1:21:39] this church had a great revival and I
[1:21:40] streamed the service and that church did
[1:21:42] that and this one did that and back in
[1:21:44] brother Brandham's time people got
[1:21:45] healed but the word is speaking to you
[1:21:48] this morning and speaking to me do you
[1:21:50] want a revival do you want your family
[1:21:52] to be in revival do you want your home
[1:21:54] to have the token applied to it it's
[1:21:56] here for you if you want it to be
[1:21:59] &gt;&gt; do you want to be well
[1:22:00] &gt;&gt; come Amen.
[1:22:02] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:22:04] &gt;&gt; Jesus knew that over time our conditions
[1:22:07] become a routine.
[1:22:08] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:22:10] &gt;&gt; There's a something this is a little bit
[1:22:13] too knowledgeable for me. But how many
[1:22:14] of you know what the second law of
[1:22:16] thermodynamics is?
[1:22:19] There's somebody. The second law of
[1:22:21] thermodynamics. I didn't know either
[1:22:23] till I read it.
[1:22:26] But the second law of thermodynamics is
[1:22:28] is basically that there's this layman's
[1:22:30] terms, but there's no perpetual motion
[1:22:32] machine,
[1:22:33] &gt;&gt; right? Anything that's going will
[1:22:36] eventually stop
[1:22:38] &gt;&gt; because of the law of entropy. Entropy
[1:22:42] is what causes food to cool naturally.
[1:22:45] You ever wonder why it don't just stay
[1:22:46] hot?
[1:22:48] Why does it cool but never get reheated?
[1:22:51] Right? If a if the temperature remains
[1:22:54] constant, food will cool down,
[1:22:57] right? To room temperature. And the only
[1:23:00] way to get it to to get heated again is
[1:23:02] to introduce a heat source.
[1:23:04] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:23:06] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:23:08] So listen, and the same thing is true of
[1:23:10] our lives. You take a uh ice, you know,
[1:23:14] ice is in you can put it in your
[1:23:15] remember when we used to put it in our
[1:23:17] refrigerator and it was square because
[1:23:18] we had it in a one of them things that
[1:23:20] we never refilled. we always put back in
[1:23:21] the freezer and let mom refill.
[1:23:25] Some of y'all know what I'm talking
[1:23:26] about. We had a little ice thing and and
[1:23:28] you take it out and use all the ice and
[1:23:30] put it back empty in the freezer. My
[1:23:32] wife used to get so upset at that. We'd
[1:23:35] always put it empty. We didn't have the
[1:23:36] money to have an ice machine, you know,
[1:23:38] and we just put that thing back in. Some
[1:23:40] of y'all may still use those. And but
[1:23:42] have you ever wondered why that if it
[1:23:44] you let it sit out, it'll melt, but
[1:23:46] it'll never become square again? Because
[1:23:49] order doesn't come about naturally.
[1:23:53] &gt;&gt; I hope you're hearing me today.
[1:23:55] &gt;&gt; People are just waiting on something to
[1:23:57] happen as if it's just going to happen.
[1:24:00] &gt;&gt; Order doesn't come about naturally. This
[1:24:02] world didn't come about. Listen, if you
[1:24:04] believe this world would come about by
[1:24:05] evolution, why don't you take off your
[1:24:07] watch and separate it in a million
[1:24:08] pieces and shake it for a million years
[1:24:11] or billion years, however long you want
[1:24:12] to, and see if it becomes a watch again.
[1:24:15] It'll never become a watch because order
[1:24:17] doesn't come naturally. Disorder becomes
[1:24:20] naturally. Some of you elderly folks
[1:24:22] know what I'm talking about, right? Your
[1:24:24] body fails naturally,
[1:24:26] &gt;&gt; but healing only comes from him.
[1:24:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [laughter]
[1:24:31] Listen, cooling off comes naturally to a
[1:24:34] church.
[1:24:35] &gt;&gt; Cooling off, backsliding comes naturally
[1:24:37] to a human being. But order comes
[1:24:40] [screaming] by the word
[1:24:42] &gt;&gt; like he did in the beginning when the
[1:24:43] earth was without form and void. Oh,
[1:24:45] come on church. Somebody ought to take
[1:24:46] that and preach a whole sermon on it.
[1:24:48] Order comes from the word, but disorder
[1:24:51] comes naturally, but order comes by the
[1:24:53] spoken word and the word is spoken in
[1:24:55] our day and said, "Let there be light."
[1:24:57] And there was light. Let there be a
[1:24:59] bride and there was a bride.
[1:25:01] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The only reason we're here
[1:25:03] Oh, come on, church. The only reason we
[1:25:05] have any order to our services, we have
[1:25:06] any order to our lives, is because God
[1:25:08] sent a prophet. And he didn't just let
[1:25:10] that prophet speak what he wanted to,
[1:25:12] but he spoke through him and it spoke
[1:25:14] order.
[1:25:15] &gt;&gt; It called us back to the word, which is
[1:25:17] God's order.
[1:25:20] &gt;&gt; Good.
[1:25:24] &gt;&gt; See, we must have revival or we will
[1:25:28] become cold, formal, and powerless.
[1:25:30] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:25:31] &gt;&gt; It's true.
[1:25:31] &gt;&gt; Just naturally.
[1:25:36] Like a if you set out water, I've talked
[1:25:39] about this before. You set out a cup of
[1:25:40] water, you won't even notice it. In a
[1:25:42] week, come back and that water will be
[1:25:44] almost gone.
[1:25:46] Where did it go? Na nature,
[1:25:49] evaporation.
[1:25:51] The energy stopped moving. It stopped
[1:25:54] moving and it slowly evaporates into the
[1:25:56] air. The same way our our our our
[1:26:00] fervor, our
[1:26:03] See, you can't lose your salvation like
[1:26:04] that. I know what some of you are
[1:26:05] thinking. You don't lose your salvation,
[1:26:07] but you lose the joy of it
[1:26:10] &gt;&gt; naturally.
[1:26:14] It just kind of goes into the air. See,
[1:26:17] every morning he'd come down there and
[1:26:18] he'd come to church, you know, and he
[1:26:20] spread out his blanket in the same spot.
[1:26:22] He had his little spot
[1:26:24] in the church. Some of y'all I wouldn't
[1:26:27] I wouldn't know if you're alive if you
[1:26:28] weren't sitting in the same spots, you
[1:26:29] know.
[1:26:32] Even our kids, they got their little
[1:26:33] spots, you know, and they they sit in
[1:26:35] their spot and [snorts] and he had his
[1:26:39] little blanket.
[1:26:40] He spread it down there, little cot.
[1:26:43] He laid down on it. He said, "You know,
[1:26:46] I can walk a little. I can get here.
[1:26:50] I can make it to church, but I just
[1:26:52] can't seem to get to the water.
[1:26:57] Just can't before." See, I watch other
[1:26:59] people get blessed, but I just can't
[1:27:01] seem to get to the water.
[1:27:06] He's just laying there thinking about
[1:27:07] it. He'd been there for maybe 38 years.
[1:27:09] Maybe the whole time he'd been sick,
[1:27:12] thinking about it. And [snorts] oh, once
[1:27:14] he kind of felt somebody near him,
[1:27:17] a shadow come over him.
[1:27:21] He said,
[1:27:24] "Who are you?"
[1:27:26] He said, ' Do you want to be well?
[1:27:31] &gt;&gt; Well, I don't have any man.
[1:27:34] I would get well, but the preacher,
[1:27:36] &gt;&gt; come on.
[1:27:42] &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "That don't matter. Do you
[1:27:43] want to be well?"
[1:27:47] &gt;&gt; Said, "But my husband, do you want to be
[1:27:49] well?"
[1:27:50] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:27:50] &gt;&gt; My wife, do you want to be well?
[1:27:53] &gt;&gt; My children, do you want to be well?
[1:27:55] Wilt thou be made whole?
[1:27:59] You see, the fact that he asked him that
[1:28:00] question meant it was for him.
[1:28:02] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:28:04] &gt;&gt; And I may not have time to go through
[1:28:05] all this this morning, but in [snorts]
[1:28:07] Psalm 42:7, David says, "Deep calleth to
[1:28:10] deep at the noise of thy water spouts."
[1:28:13] A deep is a main body of water or or a
[1:28:17] spring, a place where the where the
[1:28:18] water comes from. the deep calls, the
[1:28:22] deep spring calls to another deep
[1:28:24] spring.
[1:28:26] So, Brother Brandham takes that and he
[1:28:28] said, "If there's a deep calling, there
[1:28:30] must be another deep to respond."
[1:28:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. If there was a word looking
[1:28:36] for you and it come by your way and it
[1:28:38] said, "Do you want to be well?" Jesus
[1:28:40] never asked that question. There were
[1:28:42] 4,999
[1:28:44] people sitting there that never heard
[1:28:45] the question. But you found out about
[1:28:47] the message. You heard the question. Do
[1:28:49] you want to be well? How did you hear
[1:28:51] the question? Because Jesus come by your
[1:28:53] way.
[1:28:57] &gt;&gt; He said deep was calling to the deep.
[1:29:01] See, if there's something in you
[1:29:02] calling, there must be a revival for
[1:29:05] you.
[1:29:08] &gt;&gt; It was Samson who stood there one day
[1:29:10] after he had slaughtered a thousand
[1:29:12] Philistines. He killed a thousand of
[1:29:14] them with the jawbone of a mule.
[1:29:17] actually a donkey. There's even a
[1:29:20] smaller jawbone,
[1:29:22] more brittle, laying out in the desert.
[1:29:25] He picks it up and kills a thousand
[1:29:27] armored Philistines with it.
[1:29:30] &gt;&gt; When he gets done,
[1:29:32] he gets thirsty. Cuz working for the
[1:29:35] Lord, many times we give, but we don't
[1:29:38] take in. Listen to me, deacons,
[1:29:40] trustees, preachers. We give but we
[1:29:43] don't take in enough.
[1:29:45] &gt;&gt; We give and we give constantly.
[1:29:47] constantly give.
[1:29:51] &gt;&gt; But if we're not careful, we don't
[1:29:52] receive.
[1:29:54] That's why my burden's been even for
[1:29:56] those in the back and those trying to
[1:29:57] help out in the services. Sometimes you
[1:29:59] do that over and over and over again and
[1:30:01] you're giving, but you end up like
[1:30:02] Samson at the end and you say, "Well,
[1:30:04] I've given and I've given and I've
[1:30:05] given." Some of you mamas do that for
[1:30:07] your own family. You give and you work
[1:30:09] and you give and you work and you don't
[1:30:10] stop from daylight till dusk and you
[1:30:12] don't realize you've been given.
[1:30:14] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:30:14] &gt;&gt; But not receiving. Yes sir. Yes.
[1:30:17] &gt;&gt; You get thirsty.
[1:30:21] But Samson had enough about him that he
[1:30:23] knew he was dry
[1:30:27] and he began to cry out. The Bible said
[1:30:29] it come to pass when he made it into
[1:30:30] speaking he cast away the jawbone out of
[1:30:31] his hand. He called that place Ramoth
[1:30:33] liy which means jaw. And he was sore
[1:30:37] thirst and called on the Lord and said
[1:30:38] thou hast given this great deliverance
[1:30:40] into the hand of thy servant. Now shall
[1:30:42] I die for thirst and fall into the hand
[1:30:44] of the uncircumcised? He needed revival.
[1:30:48] &gt;&gt; But God
[1:30:50] &gt;&gt; rich in mercy.
[1:30:52] &gt;&gt; Oh, aren't you glad there's a revival
[1:30:53] for you today? God rich in mercy clave a
[1:30:56] hollow place that was in the jaw and
[1:30:58] there came water there. And when he had
[1:31:00] drunk, his spirit came again and he
[1:31:02] revived. Wherefore when he he called the
[1:31:04] name thereof inhor which is in Lehi and
[1:31:07] to this day inhor means the spring of
[1:31:10] one who called
[1:31:12] the spring of one calling. Oh church
[1:31:15] there's a spring for somebody that'll
[1:31:17] call. Brother said there's never been
[1:31:19] found a better way to receive from God
[1:31:21] than to ask for it.
[1:31:23] &gt;&gt; No wonder Jesus asked the man the
[1:31:25] question do you want to be well? The
[1:31:27] word come by his way knowing he had a
[1:31:29] deep desire to be well.
[1:31:33] Hallelujah.
[1:31:34] The B said here not long ago when the
[1:31:36] church began to cool off and get formal
[1:31:37] through the great Wesley revival, people
[1:31:39] begin to hunger for more of God. If you
[1:31:41] hunger for more of God, there's bound to
[1:31:43] be more of God to respond to it
[1:31:45] somewhere.
[1:31:46] If you've only been justified by faith
[1:31:48] and know nothing about the baptism of
[1:31:50] the Holy Ghost and you hunger for it,
[1:31:52] there's got to be a Holy Ghost somewhere
[1:31:54] to fill that hungering. That's right.
[1:31:56] And if you believe today there is a God
[1:31:58] who heals, there's got to be a fountain
[1:32:00] open somewhere. Oh, come on, sick
[1:32:02] people. Don't you realize there's a
[1:32:04] fountain [screaming] open. The God who
[1:32:05] said, "I am the God that health thee is
[1:32:07] walking right among you this morning."
[1:32:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:32:12] Hallelujah. Said, "If you believe today
[1:32:15] there's a God who heals, there's got to
[1:32:16] be a fountain open somewhere
[1:32:18] &gt;&gt; for healing or that desire wouldn't be
[1:32:21] there." Like Simeon who expected to see
[1:32:23] the Messiah.
[1:32:25] There was a deep calling to the deep.
[1:32:30] Brother man said, "Now look, if the Holy
[1:32:32] Spirit has promised you something and
[1:32:34] you've been expecting it, it's up to the
[1:32:36] Holy Spirit then to see that you're led
[1:32:37] to it." Hallelujah.
[1:32:40] &gt;&gt; How many has been expecting revival? He
[1:32:43] said, "All right, now maybe this is the
[1:32:44] time." He's led you to it.
[1:32:47] &gt;&gt; He brought you to church this morning.
[1:32:50] &gt;&gt; We might as well have revival.
[1:32:53] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:32:54] He said, "If there's a revival in
[1:32:56] making, he will bring you right in."
[1:32:59] &gt;&gt; How many has been expecting healing? He
[1:33:02] said, "Sure." All right. Then here you
[1:33:04] are right at the fountain. David,
[1:33:06] hallelujah. David said, "When the deep
[1:33:08] calls to the deep, but there's a deep
[1:33:10] calling on the inside, there's got to be
[1:33:11] a deep somewhere to respond to that
[1:33:12] deep." He said, "Before," he said,
[1:33:14] "Here, your people live by the seaside.
[1:33:16] Before there was a fin on a fish's back,
[1:33:18] there had to be a water first for him to
[1:33:20] swim in, or he would never had no fin."
[1:33:22] Yeah.
[1:33:23] &gt;&gt; Well, that's good Kentucky reasoning
[1:33:25] right there, isn't it?
[1:33:27] &gt;&gt; What good is the fin without the water?
[1:33:29] &gt;&gt; See, the evolutionists believe that he
[1:33:31] just had to grow a fin to swim. Well,
[1:33:34] what did he do in the meantime?
[1:33:38] &gt;&gt; It's a good question.
[1:33:41] &gt;&gt; But God made a fin on him
[1:33:43] &gt;&gt; cuz he had water for him to swim in.
[1:33:45] Come on.
[1:33:48] &gt;&gt; There's people trying to grow fins. You
[1:33:50] know, they come to church and be like,
[1:33:51] "I, you know, I got to here's water. I
[1:33:54] got to swim." No, that's not how you do
[1:33:56] it. You can't grow yourself a fin. God
[1:33:58] made you a fin. He made you a fish. He
[1:34:00] made you able to to receive from the
[1:34:02] spirit of God. Don't think you can't do
[1:34:04] it. You can or you would never been
[1:34:06] called to it. Do you want to be well? Do
[1:34:08] you want revival? You can have revival.
[1:34:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Right?
[1:34:13] &gt;&gt; There's got to be a deep somewhere to
[1:34:15] respond to the deep. He said the fish,
[1:34:17] there had to be a water first for him to
[1:34:18] swim in. He never had no fin. Before
[1:34:20] there was a tree to grow in the earth,
[1:34:21] there had to be an earth first or
[1:34:22] there'd be no tree to grow in it.
[1:34:24] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham talked about the boy
[1:34:25] eating sulfur. He said he would eat
[1:34:27] rubber cuz there's sulfur in it.
[1:34:30] &gt;&gt; I used to eat my p, you know, racers off
[1:34:33] of pencils. I think it was just nerves,
[1:34:34] but but he said this little boy would
[1:34:36] eat the the pedals off a bicycle.
[1:34:38] &gt;&gt; He said, "Why does he do that?" Because
[1:34:40] there's something in a boy craving for
[1:34:42] sulfur.
[1:34:43] &gt;&gt; That rubber had sulfur in it. He didn't
[1:34:45] even know that. Listen, he didn't need a
[1:34:47] a breakdown of what was in it. Some of
[1:34:49] us are waiting on God to just reveal
[1:34:51] everything to us. Show me where the
[1:34:52] sulfur is. Follow the craving of your
[1:34:54] heart.
[1:34:55] &gt;&gt; If it's craving for spiritual things,
[1:34:57] follow that to him.
[1:35:02] &gt;&gt; God never sent Simeon a map.
[1:35:05] He was just walking by the spirit.
[1:35:08] He never sent him a map and said it had
[1:35:10] a little X on it said you are here
[1:35:12] &gt;&gt; and here is the baby Jesus.
[1:35:14] &gt;&gt; He never sent blind Anna a map. She
[1:35:16] couldn't have read it anyway.
[1:35:18] &gt;&gt; But she still found Jesus.
[1:35:21] &gt;&gt; How did she find him? Hallelujah.
[1:35:23] Because she was predestined for ordained
[1:35:25] to find him. How did you find the
[1:35:27] message of the hour? You were
[1:35:28] predestined and for ordained to find
[1:35:30] Listen, you say, "Well, I come up in the
[1:35:31] message, but I come up difficult. I come
[1:35:33] up my my parents didn't do it right and
[1:35:35] this one didn't do it right and that one
[1:35:36] and I've had a difficult time but do you
[1:35:39] realize how blessed you are to have even
[1:35:41] been exposed to the message of the hour?
[1:35:43] What is it? You say, "Well, well, they
[1:35:45] didn't do it right." But just cuz they
[1:35:46] didn't do it right, they may not have
[1:35:47] been doing it for them. They may have
[1:35:49] just said they were believers for you,
[1:35:52] &gt;&gt; sir.
[1:35:54] &gt;&gt; Oh, [laughter] God.
[1:35:56] Oh, I hope you're hearing it today.
[1:35:58] &gt;&gt; [gasps]
[1:35:59] &gt;&gt; There might have been hypocrite after
[1:36:00] hypocrite after hypocrite come and it
[1:36:02] might been just to call you.
[1:36:08] [snorts]
[1:36:08] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said if you're
[1:36:09] thirsting for more of God, how many
[1:36:11] would like to have more of God? How many
[1:36:12] could say amen to that this morning?
[1:36:14] &gt;&gt; How many would like to have more of God?
[1:36:15] He said if you're thirsting for more of
[1:36:16] God, he said it shows there's more of
[1:36:18] God for you to have.
[1:36:20] &gt;&gt; That's right. You want to be healed.
[1:36:21] Well, just as sure as you believe God is
[1:36:23] a healer. There's a fountain open
[1:36:24] somewhere or you'd never have that
[1:36:26] desire. If you crave to have the Holy
[1:36:29] Ghost,
[1:36:30] &gt;&gt; that shows there's a fountain open
[1:36:31] somewhere. Hallelujah. [screaming]
[1:36:33] filled with the Holy Ghost. See, there
[1:36:36] has to be a creator to create the
[1:36:37] creation. And then there has to be
[1:36:38] something out there to respond to that
[1:36:40] creation. Hallelujah. [gasps]
[1:36:44] Oh Lord, he said, "Now, the Holy Spirit
[1:36:46] was obligated then to lead him to that
[1:36:48] fountain." Oh, if you're expecting it,
[1:36:49] the same Holy Spirit leads you to that
[1:36:51] fountain. It's got to open up somewhere.
[1:36:53] If you've got that burning desire in
[1:36:55] your heart, the Holy Spirit is obligated
[1:36:56] to lead you to it, right? To that
[1:36:58] fountain filled with blood drawn from
[1:36:59] Emanuel's veins.
[1:37:01] &gt;&gt; We're sinners. He said, "That's
[1:37:02] unbelievers. Plunge beneath the flood
[1:37:04] and lose all their unbelief." I said,
[1:37:06] "God, take it all away from me today.
[1:37:08] Let me plunge. Lead me to the fountain
[1:37:11] &gt;&gt; where I can have my unbelief washed
[1:37:13] away."
[1:37:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:37:17] Oh, you want to be to a place where you
[1:37:19] can surpass any doubt
[1:37:22] &gt;&gt; in your mind.
[1:37:24] &gt;&gt; Hear me for a minute. I'm challenging
[1:37:25] you this morning. Sitting there say,
[1:37:27] "Well, I wonder if this is true. I
[1:37:28] wonder I wonder if that's true." Do you
[1:37:32] want to be to a place
[1:37:35] that can surpass any doubt in your mind?
[1:37:39] Do you want to be sure
[1:37:42] that you have the Holy Ghost?
[1:37:44] Do you want to be sure the message is
[1:37:46] true?
[1:37:49] &gt;&gt; Don't you want to be that way? Well,
[1:37:52] there's a fountain somewhere
[1:37:55] to do that.
[1:37:58] &gt;&gt; Good.
[1:37:59] &gt;&gt; So, you think you need explanation, but
[1:38:01] really what you need is to get the
[1:38:03] leadership of the Holy Ghost to just
[1:38:04] lead you to the fountain.
[1:38:08] [snorts] Listen, brother. Brandon said
[1:38:11] he's praying and I won't read all this,
[1:38:13] but he talked about the people being
[1:38:14] under expectation. We're [snorts] going
[1:38:16] to skip down a couple of paragraphs,
[1:38:21] three paragraphs now. He said, "May
[1:38:22] there be such a great cry go out among
[1:38:24] the people thirsting for God till there
[1:38:28] will come a revival throughout the
[1:38:29] country here. Every church will be
[1:38:31] packed full of people. Sinners crying
[1:38:34] out for God to have mercy. the Holy
[1:38:36] Spirit, healing the sick, making the
[1:38:38] lame to walk, raising up the dead, and
[1:38:40] granting those things that's been
[1:38:42] promised in thy word.
[1:38:44] &gt;&gt; He said, "Come, Lord Jesus, and fulfill
[1:38:46] thy promise. Come to us tonight. We
[1:38:48] believe that you're the same yesterday,
[1:38:50] today, and forever. That your promises
[1:38:51] cannot fail. Both heavens and earth will
[1:38:54] fail, but your word will not fail. May
[1:38:55] our understanding be open. May the Holy
[1:38:58] Spirit come and lay the fow ground. May
[1:38:59] our understanding be open to what? to
[1:39:01] the spirit and power of God tonight that
[1:39:04] he might manifest his promised words
[1:39:07] through us.
[1:39:09] &gt;&gt; What is he saying? If the church is
[1:39:12] gathered to want revival, there must be
[1:39:14] revival. So he said, "Lord, come and
[1:39:15] send a revival."
[1:39:17] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:39:18] &gt;&gt; See, the man was waiting on the moving
[1:39:21] of the water.
[1:39:22] &gt;&gt; But his revival come and tapped him on
[1:39:24] the shoulder
[1:39:26] &gt;&gt; and said, "Do you want it? Do you want
[1:39:29] to be well?
[1:39:32] said, "You call for revival. You wait
[1:39:34] for your church to have a revival."
[1:39:36] Well, that ain't the revival for you.
[1:39:38] The revival ought to begin right in you.
[1:39:40] When you begin to thirst for God, there
[1:39:43] might not be another member of the
[1:39:44] church wanting that revival, but if it
[1:39:46] breaks out in you, it'll break out other
[1:39:48] places.
[1:39:50] &gt;&gt; Is there something in you today that's
[1:39:52] longing for renewing of the Holy Ghost?
[1:39:54] I just want to stir that up today. I
[1:39:56] believe it's there. I just want to stir
[1:39:57] it up. Is there something in you that
[1:39:59] longs for renewal? Is there something in
[1:40:01] you that longs for a revival?
[1:40:03] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:40:05] &gt;&gt; I just about shouted and run and spoke
[1:40:07] in tongues the other day when I saw
[1:40:08] grass growing out here.
[1:40:12] &gt;&gt; Where we had poured dirt. You don't know
[1:40:14] how that made me feel. We grew grass in
[1:40:17] January.
[1:40:19] It's ry grass, but it'll it'll work till
[1:40:22] the warm weather comes
[1:40:24] &gt;&gt; and the weather's cooperated. But I got
[1:40:26] so excited. My kids do not understand
[1:40:30] why I was so excited to see that become
[1:40:33] green
[1:40:37] because
[1:40:39] church there's a desire in my heart.
[1:40:42] I want to see I have it in my mind a
[1:40:44] picture. I want to see green grass kids
[1:40:46] playing volleyball out there all getting
[1:40:48] along.
[1:40:54] There's something in my mind, in my
[1:40:56] spirit. Me and Brother Joel were
[1:40:57] thinking about it and talking about it.
[1:40:58] This is what we want. And we presented
[1:41:00] to the trustees and they said, "Let's do
[1:41:01] it." And and the church has gotten
[1:41:03] behind it and we put it out there and
[1:41:05] and and now it's starting to grow. And
[1:41:07] there's something in me when I see it.
[1:41:09] What does it do? It's a deep calling to
[1:41:12] the deep. There was something in me
[1:41:13] calling for it. And now it's starting to
[1:41:15] come. Oh, I hope you're hearing me
[1:41:16] today, church. It's just like that. When
[1:41:18] you come to the house of God, don't you
[1:41:20] want to feel his presence? Don't you
[1:41:22] want to see them little green shoots? It
[1:41:23] might be winter time. It might be
[1:41:25] leosia. It might be a hard time. It
[1:41:27] might be hard and stony ground, but
[1:41:30] there will be some grass grow. If you'll
[1:41:31] set the conditions right, what did we
[1:41:33] do? We just sowed the grass and started
[1:41:35] watering it and started watering it and
[1:41:37] started watering it. What do you do? Sew
[1:41:39] the Let the grass be sown. I believe
[1:41:41] it's been sown. The word has been sown
[1:41:43] in your heart. Then you start to water
[1:41:44] that. Brother Brandham taught us how to
[1:41:46] water it. He said, "Water it praises.
[1:41:49] &gt;&gt; Water with your Don't you realize,
[1:41:50] listen, if you had a bunch of grass you
[1:41:52] want to grow, you'd get out there with a
[1:41:53] water hose like me. I have and my wife
[1:41:55] has and get out there and water that
[1:41:57] grass. I'll tell you what, if you wanted
[1:41:58] it to grow, that's what you do. If you
[1:42:01] really wanted revival, you begin to call
[1:42:03] out for it. You begin to raise your
[1:42:04] hands in the house of God.
[1:42:08] &gt;&gt; You begin to do what it takes.
[1:42:11] &gt;&gt; To have it,
[1:42:17] [snorts]
[1:42:19] &gt;&gt; I need a job, but I must have revival.
[1:42:22] Yeah.
[1:42:23] &gt;&gt; I need my family, but I must have
[1:42:25] revival or I'll lose my family.
[1:42:28] &gt;&gt; Are you with me now?
[1:42:30] &gt;&gt; I want this church. I want everything to
[1:42:31] be right and all the all the stuff in
[1:42:34] it, all the the building and the and the
[1:42:36] doors and everything to be just right.
[1:42:39] But I must have revival.
[1:42:41] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:42:44] &gt;&gt; See, we are not waiting on a man to come
[1:42:46] by and help us get to the water.
[1:42:50] The man is here
[1:42:52] &gt;&gt; and he's not me. He's the word.
[1:42:56] &gt;&gt; See, the Bible says, "I will pour water
[1:42:59] upon him that is thirsty
[1:43:01] and floods upon the dry ground. I'll
[1:43:04] pour my spirit upon thy seed." My
[1:43:07] blessing upon thine offspring.
[1:43:10] &gt;&gt; Oh, if it made my heart leap for joy
[1:43:11] when I saw grass grow, how much more
[1:43:13] does it make my heart leap for joy when
[1:43:15] I see the spirit begin to show itself in
[1:43:17] the lives of these young people? When I
[1:43:19] see people who've been backsitting begin
[1:43:21] to come back to God, begin to serve God
[1:43:22] with all of their heart. When I begin to
[1:43:24] see green grass grow,
[1:43:27] &gt;&gt; oh, it does something in my heart. I
[1:43:28] pray it would do something in all of our
[1:43:29] hearts.
[1:43:31] &gt;&gt; Listen, he said in Isaiah 55:1, "Oh,
[1:43:33] everyone that thirsteth, come ye to the
[1:43:36] waters. He that hath no money, come ye
[1:43:38] buy and eat, come by wine and milk
[1:43:40] without money and without price."
[1:43:42] Matthew 5:6, blessed are they which do
[1:43:44] hunger and thirst after righteousness,
[1:43:46] for they, someone say it with me, they
[1:43:48] shall be filled. They shall be filled.
[1:43:52] Hallelujah. I believe that's true this
[1:43:54] morning. In John 7:37, Jesus stood up.
[1:43:57] This is after he'd come and healed the
[1:43:58] man at Bethesda, he stood up in that
[1:44:00] great day of the feast, and he cried,
[1:44:02] saying, "If any man thirst, let him come
[1:44:04] unto me and drink." But he's got to be
[1:44:07] thirsty. But he put a thirst in you for
[1:44:09] a reason. If any man thirst, let him
[1:44:11] come and drink. He that believeth on me,
[1:44:13] as the scripture said, out of his belly
[1:44:15] shall flow rivers of living water.
[1:44:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He is speaking now. We're
[1:44:21] not just looking at the sign, but the
[1:44:23] voice of the sign is spoken in our day.
[1:44:25] The word has been preached in his
[1:44:26] fullness. He's speaking now through the
[1:44:29] prophet and the bride. She under her
[1:44:31] messenger will be the final voice to the
[1:44:33] final age. The Bible says, "And the
[1:44:35] spirit and the bride say, come." Let him
[1:44:38] that hearth say, "Come." Let him that is
[1:44:41] a thirst.
[1:44:42] &gt;&gt; Come on. Yes.
[1:44:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:44:45] Let him come. This is not the hour of no
[1:44:48] revival. This is the hour of the bride's
[1:44:50] revival.
[1:44:52] &gt;&gt; Let the elected come.
[1:44:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:44:58] Whosoever will let him take the water of
[1:45:02] life freely. He said, "But Ben, I'm
[1:45:04] thirsty. What do I do?"
[1:45:07] Jesus saith unto the man, "Rise."
[1:45:12] &gt;&gt; That's an action of faith.
[1:45:15] &gt;&gt; He wouldn't have risen from there unless
[1:45:18] he believed that the word was present.
[1:45:22] Once he recognizes it, rise.
[1:45:25] &gt;&gt; Take up thy bed and walk. [snorts]
[1:45:29] Change your posture from waiting to
[1:45:33] receiving.
[1:45:35] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:45:36] &gt;&gt; From laying there
[1:45:38] &gt;&gt; to expectation.
[1:45:40] &gt;&gt; Very good.
[1:45:40] &gt;&gt; From just going to church.
[1:45:42] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:45:43] &gt;&gt; To expecting God to move.
[1:45:46] &gt;&gt; Change your posture.
[1:45:48] &gt;&gt; See, obedience is better than sacrifice.
[1:45:50] The Bible says, Listen, brother Brandham
[1:45:52] says this and I'm closing. He said,
[1:45:55] 'What about you down on the cases? I
[1:45:57] believe there's a lot of cot cases
[1:45:59] spiritually.
[1:46:01] A lot of cot cases, people who can't
[1:46:03] seem to walk like they should walk
[1:46:06] spiritually. Walk with the Lord. A lot
[1:46:08] of cot cases around. He said, "Do you
[1:46:11] believe?" What about you on the cot
[1:46:12] cases? Do you believe? He said, "You
[1:46:15] believe me?" He said, "You've been
[1:46:16] sitting there, lady. I looked at you a
[1:46:18] while ago. Now, now this is something
[1:46:20] important. You catch this. Here was a
[1:46:22] lady who was interested in somebody
[1:46:24] else. And the prophet sees the lady's
[1:46:27] interest
[1:46:29] in another person.
[1:46:31] &gt;&gt; It pays to care about people.
[1:46:34] &gt;&gt; This lady is interested in a little
[1:46:36] girl. Maybe it was her daughter. Maybe
[1:46:37] it's her niece. We don't know. But he
[1:46:40] said, "You're interested in that little
[1:46:41] girl laying there. Is that right?" He
[1:46:44] said, "I can't heal the child."
[1:46:47] Look, it wasn't so much the the faith of
[1:46:49] the child that reached out to him. It
[1:46:51] was the faith of the woman who was
[1:46:52] interested in the child. Could we have a
[1:46:54] church full of people that are
[1:46:55] interested in our young people?
[1:46:57] &gt;&gt; Could we have a church full of people
[1:46:58] that are interested in the word being
[1:47:00] preached, that are interested in the
[1:47:01] songs being sung, that are interested in
[1:47:03] the worship.
[1:47:06] &gt;&gt; They were interested. Maybe you got
[1:47:07] somebody today you're interested in. The
[1:47:09] word is here
[1:47:11] &gt;&gt; to speak to that person. Even if they're
[1:47:13] not here this morning, the word is not
[1:47:15] bound by walls.
[1:47:19] &gt;&gt; It can go right down where they're
[1:47:21] laying. Speak to them.
[1:47:25] He said, "You were interested." He said,
[1:47:26] "I can't heal the child. Look this way,
[1:47:27] young lady. Do you believe me to be
[1:47:28] God's prophet, sister?" He said, "If you
[1:47:30] lay there, you'll die."
[1:47:31] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:47:33] &gt;&gt; He said, "The trouble's in the stomach."
[1:47:35] Isn't that right? He said, "Very bad,
[1:47:37] too. Nothing can help you outside of
[1:47:39] God."
[1:47:40] He said, 'Would you take my word for
[1:47:42] something?
[1:47:44] &gt;&gt; What if we could take a prophet's words
[1:47:46] for something this morning?
[1:47:48] &gt;&gt; He said, 'The angel of Almighty God is
[1:47:51] standing near your cot.
[1:47:54] &gt;&gt; She couldn't see it, but she could
[1:47:57] believe it when a prophet said it.
[1:48:00] [snorts]
[1:48:01] &gt;&gt; Oh, God. [laughter]
[1:48:03] You realize the same prophet that told
[1:48:05] her that said, "If you could see," he
[1:48:06] said, "If you could press through the
[1:48:07] veil of the flesh, you'd see angels at
[1:48:09] their position at every pew."
[1:48:11] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:48:15] &gt;&gt; If you can believe, if you could take
[1:48:16] his word for something, he said,
[1:48:18] "There's the angel of almighty God is
[1:48:20] standing by your c."
[1:48:23] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:48:23] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:48:24] &gt;&gt; He's interested in your condition.
[1:48:28] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. [laughter]
[1:48:29] I know it's been evangelistic for a
[1:48:31] Sunday morning, but I just I just felt
[1:48:33] it on my heart.
[1:48:36] &gt;&gt; He said, "I see your examination." He
[1:48:39] said, "I hear what he tells you." The
[1:48:41] girl didn't even know how bad off she
[1:48:43] was.
[1:48:47] &gt;&gt; They'd hid it from her.
[1:48:49] &gt;&gt; You may come to church thinking you were
[1:48:51] okay, but as the word was being
[1:48:52] preached, it began to discern the
[1:48:54] thought of your heart and you said,
[1:48:55] "Lord, I need more of you." Yes.
[1:48:58] &gt;&gt; He said, "I see your examination. I hear
[1:49:00] what he tells you. They're keeping
[1:49:01] something back from you. But let me tell
[1:49:03] you, if you believe Jesus Christ to be
[1:49:06] your healer and will accept him to be
[1:49:08] so, will you serve him all the days of
[1:49:10] your life, you'll do it?" He said, "Then
[1:49:12] as a servant of God, I command you."
[1:49:14] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:49:15] &gt;&gt; Now, this is different
[1:49:18] because Pentecostals of the day would
[1:49:19] have commanded God.
[1:49:22] &gt;&gt; But that's not what brother Brandham
[1:49:23] did. See, we don't command God.
[1:49:27] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:49:27] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham didn't even command the
[1:49:29] evil spirit. He commanded her.
[1:49:34] &gt;&gt; He said, "I command you cuz greater is
[1:49:37] he that is in you than he that is in the
[1:49:39] world."
[1:49:40] &gt;&gt; I command you in the name of Jesus
[1:49:42] Christ to take up your bed
[1:49:45] and go home
[1:49:47] and get Well, don't you fear. You have
[1:49:50] strength. You have strength. Don't
[1:49:51] worry. Rise up.
[1:49:54] go home.
[1:49:56] &gt;&gt; Now, what is it? Just the act of
[1:49:58] standing and rolling up her cot.
[1:50:02] &gt;&gt; Right? That that's what the man did that
[1:50:03] Jesus spoke to. Just he was a cot case.
[1:50:06] Just the act of standing
[1:50:08] &gt;&gt; and rolling up his cot meant he was
[1:50:10] divorcing himself from the idea of being
[1:50:12] sick.
[1:50:14] &gt;&gt; And accepting the idea of being well.
[1:50:17] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. You say, "Well, I'll come
[1:50:19] to church when I feel like it. I'll come
[1:50:21] to church when I get everything in
[1:50:22] order." No. Come to church right now.
[1:50:24] Come to church while you're sick. Come
[1:50:26] to church even if you got sin in your
[1:50:27] life. You come and when you hear the
[1:50:29] word preached, take up that old thing
[1:50:31] and start to roll it [screaming] up and
[1:50:32] start to walk with God. And if you'll
[1:50:34] walk away from it, your sickness can be
[1:50:36] left there at that disappointing pool.
[1:50:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:50:43] [gasps]
[1:50:44] &gt;&gt; Oh, I believe we ought to speak as if
[1:50:45] we're speaking every day to dying people
[1:50:47] because we are.
[1:50:49] &gt;&gt; We don't know what tomorrow holds. He
[1:50:52] said, 'Lady, I speak again to lay there
[1:50:54] is death in the name of Jesus Christ.
[1:50:56] Rise up. He said, ' There it is. Don't
[1:51:00] ever disobey the spirit of God.
[1:51:03] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah.
[1:51:05] &gt;&gt; Do you want revival as the musicians
[1:51:07] come?
[1:51:08] Obey the word.
[1:51:10] Change your expectation.
[1:51:13] Clean up your house. Fold up your
[1:51:15] security blanket.
[1:51:19] &gt;&gt; [snorts]
[1:51:20] &gt;&gt; The reason brother Brandham said to
[1:51:21] apply the token over your house and get
[1:51:23] rid of all the filth. It's not because
[1:51:25] you say, "Well, that that stuff in
[1:51:27] there, you know, I I can't be a
[1:51:28] Christian and that stuff will keep me
[1:51:30] from being a Christian." No, you could
[1:51:31] be the worst sinner could stagger off
[1:51:32] the street and become a Christian.
[1:51:35] &gt;&gt; Right? But the reason you want to clean
[1:51:36] up your house cuz you want to apply the
[1:51:38] token to your house for your household.
[1:51:42] Roll up that cot,
[1:51:44] that security blanket you've been
[1:51:46] holding on to, that thing that you use
[1:51:47] to keep you happy, to make you
[1:51:49] satisfied.
[1:51:51] Cut the umbilical cord, if you will, of
[1:51:55] the world.
[1:51:57] Take up your bed.
[1:52:00] Get off social media if you have to.
[1:52:02] Come on, church. We need to get real
[1:52:04] about it.
[1:52:07] &gt;&gt; Throw the phone in the trash if you have
[1:52:09] to. people survive without them.
[1:52:13] Do what needs to be done to make sure
[1:52:15] that you know
[1:52:18] that you want to be well.
[1:52:22] He said, "Stand up, rise up, take up
[1:52:24] your cot." He said, "There it is. Don't
[1:52:27] ever disobey the spirit of God. Take up
[1:52:29] your bed. The word has come in our day
[1:52:31] and commanded take up your bed and
[1:52:33] walk." We're not waiting on the on the
[1:52:35] water to be moved anymore. We're not
[1:52:37] waiting on a revival to sweep through.
[1:52:38] You say, "Well, if I could just make it
[1:52:40] to this camp meeting or this meeting
[1:52:41] over here." No, the word is standing
[1:52:43] right by you. If you can believe a
[1:52:45] prophet's words, the angel of the Lord
[1:52:48] is standing right by you. Pick up your
[1:52:51] bed and walk.
[1:52:53] Rise up and go home. Does your heart
[1:52:55] long for freedom? Is there something in
[1:52:57] you like Samson when he stood there
[1:52:59] between the two pillars? He said, "Once
[1:53:01] more, Lord. There's something in me that
[1:53:03] wants liberty."
[1:53:05] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:53:06] &gt;&gt; Oh, God. I'm tired of being bound down
[1:53:08] in church. I'm tired of not being able
[1:53:10] to worship. I'm tired of not being able
[1:53:12] to break through. It's time for me to
[1:53:15] have liberty. You don't have to wait on
[1:53:17] that, church.
[1:53:19] I receive it in Jesus name. Something in
[1:53:22] you like Samson willing to risk death
[1:53:23] for liberty. Death to ideas, death to
[1:53:26] the flesh, death to the world. And rise
[1:53:29] up, take up your bed and walk.
[1:53:34] Hallelujah. Start acting like a
[1:53:36] Christian. live like a Christian. Come
[1:53:37] to the house of God. Worship the Lord
[1:53:39] until your body begins to obey your
[1:53:41] confession. Brother Brand said, don't
[1:53:43] ever say you're not a Christian. You
[1:53:44] begin to speak it and then you begin to
[1:53:46] believe it and pretty soon you begin to
[1:53:48] obey it. Hallelujah. Act like there's no
[1:53:51] trouble in the home. Act like, "Oh, come
[1:53:53] on, church. Act like there's nothing
[1:53:54] going on in your life." Say, "Well, I
[1:53:56] got all kinds of problems." Rise up,
[1:53:58] take up your bed, and walk.
[1:54:01] There's liberty here. There's freedom
[1:54:03] here.
[1:54:04] &gt;&gt; I wonder if we could do that today.
[1:54:05] Let's stand together. Rise up. Come on,
[1:54:08] church. Rise up. Take up your bed. Roll
[1:54:10] up that old security blanket and walk
[1:54:12] with God. Hallelujah. I don't know what
[1:54:16] you have need of this morning, but would
[1:54:17] you raise your hand to him? Raise your
[1:54:19] hand to him right now if you if your
[1:54:20] heart longs for freedom. If you want a
[1:54:22] refilling of the Holy Ghost, we're not
[1:54:24] waiting. We're not tearing on the Holy
[1:54:26] Ghost to come. He's already here. He's
[1:54:28] walking right by you. If you need that
[1:54:30] in your life today, if you need the
[1:54:32] spirit like I need the spirit. If you
[1:54:34] need to know his presence like I need to
[1:54:35] know his presence, let's just talk to
[1:54:37] him now. Heavenly Father, Lord Jesus, I
[1:54:40] ask you to come, Lord, in your power and
[1:54:42] your glory. Lord, I ask you to come.
[1:54:44] Here is a deep calling. Oh God, there's
[1:54:46] a deep calling in the hearts of the
[1:54:48] people who have been stirred by your
[1:54:49] word to call out for revival. I pray
[1:54:52] there would be a deep to respond. I know
[1:54:54] there is, Lord. May the angels standing
[1:54:56] by the pews begin to walk up and down.
[1:54:58] Oh God, may they begin to touch. Oh God,
[1:55:01] may they begin to heal the sick. May
[1:55:03] they begin to touch the backslider. Oh
[1:55:05] Lord, I pray you'd grant it today. Oh,
[1:55:07] how we need you, God. We can't make it
[1:55:09] another day without you. We can't make
[1:55:11] it another moment, Lord. My family needs
[1:55:13] you. I need you. Oh God, our home, Lord,
[1:55:16] would fall apart without your presence.
[1:55:18] We need you. We are impotent, Lord. We
[1:55:21] are unable to do anything on our own. We
[1:55:23] need you, Lord. I pray, oh God, that
[1:55:26] your Holy Spirit would go down in every
[1:55:28] heart, in every home, oh Lord. Oh, may
[1:55:31] we receive you, oh God. Take up our bed
[1:55:34] and walk. Walk out of that depression.
[1:55:36] Walk out of that struggle. Walk out of
[1:55:38] that up and down living. Walk out of
[1:55:40] that ungodliness and come to you. Walk
[1:55:43] out of that sickness and be made well.
[1:55:45] If your prophet told us to picture our
[1:55:47] new body, our well body, and walk
[1:55:50] towards it, I pray you'd grant it today.
[1:55:53] Oh, give us a vision, Lord. Help us to
[1:55:56] hear your word. We pray in Jesus name.
[1:56:00] Hallelujah.
[1:56:02] Why don't we water the word now? If you
[1:56:03] need prayer, the altar's open. You can
[1:56:06] come pray or I'll be glad to pray with
[1:56:07] you. Why don't you just Why don't you
[1:56:10] just worship him now? Hallelujah.
[1:56:13] You now,
[1:56:15] Lord, our spirit [music and singing]
[1:56:18] out.
[1:56:20] Oh, hallelujah.
[1:56:22] Spirit out on me, oh God. Oh Lord Jesus,
[1:56:27] we need revival every moment. Lord,
[1:56:29] yesterday's revival won't work. We need
[1:56:31] you today, Lord.
[1:56:33] &gt;&gt; Oh, put a desire in our heart, oh God.
[1:56:36] &gt;&gt; Oh, put something in my heart, Lord,
[1:56:38] that cries out for you. [music]
[1:56:40] &gt;&gt; Oh, Granny Lord Jesus.
[1:56:43] &gt;&gt; Granny Lord Jesus. Hallelujah.
[1:56:46] &gt;&gt; Oh, fill my heart, Granny Lord God.
[1:56:50] Thank you, Lord Jesus. Thank you Lord.
[1:56:52] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Oh Lord, I need
[1:56:57] [music and singing] you now. Pour your
[1:57:00] spirit out.
[1:57:07] Lord, [singing] I seek you.
[1:57:11] Help me find [singing] you.
[1:57:15] How I need your touch.
[1:57:23] Find my drying [singing]
[1:57:27] broken places
[1:57:31] thirsty for
[1:57:33] your love.
[1:57:39] Lord, forgive [singing] me
[1:57:43] if I wonder
[1:57:47] far away [singing] from you.
[1:57:54] Father,
[1:57:55] &gt;&gt; you are all I [music]
[1:57:59] ever needed.

[1:59:37] and fill my cup.
[1:59:41] Lord, [singing]
[1:59:44] I lift it up. [singing and music]
[1:59:48] &gt;&gt; Oh, we thank you, Lord Jesus. Why don't
[1:59:51] you just receive whatever you have need
[1:59:52] of this morning?
[1:59:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.

[2:11:05] again. Revive me. Let me be the revival.
[2:11:08] Let me be a personal revival." Can the
