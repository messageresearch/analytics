morning in the name of the our savior the lord it's good to be back with you it's good to be here this morning and uh you know it's been a while since we've been here be amongst our family and our friends and we we just counted a real privilege to be back with you this morning and i want to thank brother ben for giving us the opportunity the invitation to be here his support and trust to leave the church in care of another minister's hands so we just thank you for that and brother tim and brother aaron and brother timothy all back home send their greetings uh so we just under great expectation to see what god's gonna do for us this morning my brother being invited me i've been on a series back home for about a year and a half now or a year a little over god does impossible math and you may think well that's a strange topic but you just but when brother being invited me i just couldn't help but to say you know what i think that's what we're going to speak on this weekend and just trust that it'll be a blessing to you there's several parts to it we're not going to go through all the parts today because we don't have enough time right and you probably don't have enough sustainability in your backside to want to sit that long but so what we're going to do this morning is we're going to start at part one and part two and part one we're gonna look at god does impossible math nothing is impossible with god this evening by god's grace we'll look at god does the possible math part two but nothing impossible with you so i believe we as believers we have to realize that we serve a mighty god and the same word that pertained to the bridegroom also pertains to the bride so if nothing is impossible with him surely there's nothing impossible with us either so let us just bow for prayer father what a great honor and a great privilege it is to be back in the house of god with believers or to be here in hardy arkansas where brother ben and his church and the friends that i have here and that we have made over the years lord it's just a privilege to be back and i just pray this morning father you'll put the right words in our mouth hold the right words in our heart to be able to speak lord we've heard enough from man lord and we're not here to hear from man this morning but we want to hear from the son of man we're asking that lord you would overtake not only my lips but you'll overtake the ears of the here and we realized this morning father we have been trained and we have been taught that lord if we expect to get anything out of the service then we as the people have to pull on that gift of god and pull the presence of god to our situation pull the power and the presence of god to our need so lord i believe that you're that kind of god this morning i believe lord that you're the same yesterday today and forever you're very much god right now this morning at this very present time as you were 50 years ago 60 years ago you have not diminished in your power you've not diminished in your discernment you've not diminished lord in any authority about which you have granted unto man and we're here this morning lord to relinquish ourselves over to you and to that anointing and we ask father this morning that you'll take complete control of the service have preeminence in every heart and every life and lord just be with us as we just enter into the worship of the word this morning father we ask it now in jesus name amen if you have your bibles this morning we're going to look here in luke 18. gabe if you can pull a little bit of the highs out i'm kind of doing a little bit of that this morning if you don't mind we're going to look here in luke 18 and it may seem a strange section of scripture to come from but let's just enter in this morning says then a certain ruler asked him saying good master what shall i do to inherit eternal life and jesus said unto him why call us thou meet good none is good save one and that is god thou knowest the commandments do not commit adultery do not kill do not steal do not bear false witness honor thy father and thy mother and he said all these have i done from my youth up now when jesus heard these things he said unto him yet lack us thou one thing notice he'd done all these other things but he lacked only in one area of his life he says sell all that thou has and distribute to the poor and thou shalt have treasure in heaven and come follow me and when he heard this he was very sorrowful for he was a very he was very rich and when jesus saw that he was very sorrowful he said how hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of god he says for it is easier for a camel to go through the needle's eye than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of god and they that heard it said who then can be saved and he said these things which are impossible with men are possible with god you can have your seats this morning so our topic this morning is god does impossible math so when we think about math maybe some of you were math scholars sitting out here this morning uh but when we think about math many times we think about numbers we think all math you know i'm gonna count it by trade and we think well he may just excel in math but that's not necessarily the case i just happen to excel in accounting it's completely different it's a function of mathematics but it's not all the high-end math so we think about numbers we think about equations for some of you you're bored stiff when you think about math because you don't grasp the concept or maybe it strikes you with anxiety maybe you you're overwhelmed with stress but when many of us for all of us i can say when we think about math we think about problems because when you hear the word math that means somebody's got to figure out the problem in order to come to the answer that represents that math and for us we realize that our finite minds are limited to figure out many of the mathematical problems that we may face but i want you to know this morning there's not a problem by which god doesn't already have the answer to so you know what the problem may be big and it may be x y plus z hashtag this that and the other equals this and you're looking at it and your mind is blown because you can't figure it out or maybe some sickness in your home maybe some trial that you're going through and you wonder oh is there a solution is there an answer is there any way i'm going to get any kind of relief i want you to know this morning god does impossible math there's not an answer out there there's not a problem out there but with your god my god already has a solution to it but i want you to know sometimes it takes a little while to work out that problem to get to the desired result to get to the end result but i want you to know god has already figured out your problem god already knows about the solution to your situation this morning oh what a mighty god we serve you may be going through a different a difficult situation or maybe a difficult problem right now life may be difficult and you don't seem to have the answer to it sickness is maybe strict in your home hardships has inundated your life and you you don't know what to do maybe your life has been turned upside down your world turned upside down but i want you to know god does impossible math see you may not have the answer but it doesn't mean that an answer doesn't already exist just because you're not able to figure it out doesn't mean that there's no solution see he is the answer and he has the answer and maybe you're struggling to understand the why behind the problem but rest assured i can tell you one thing god has a purpose can we say amen to that god has a purpose and he's chosen you not only you but he's also chosen that problem in which you're going through to get to that desired purpose you say oh woe is me and woe is me but i want you to know god knows you he knows all through intricacies of you what makes you how you tick but he also has already designed the problem in order to get the best results out of your life so therefore god has allowed that problem to come into your life so that he can get that desire purpose and results to make you the believer in which he desires for you to be so god has it all figured out you know many years ago when i gave my heart to a lord i was a young 20 something year old college kid went through a very hard time in life and you know what i was going through it now i was like many of us why me god you know i got to the point i think many of you know me by now i've told the testimony over and over but i wanted to commit suicide i didn't want to live anymore it was really tough i really hit a dark moment in that time but now i look back on it and i see the mighty hand of god god orchestrated no the problem was too big i didn't have the answer to it but it didn't mean that god didn't have the answer to it it didn't mean that god didn't care it didn't mean that god left me to figure it out by myself he already had the solution he just had to use me to get through the problem and when we got through the problem it made me a real son of god and he's that same kind of god this morning so he may struggle many of us struggle with why but god hasn't you can have the assurance this morning that he is all you need he said and he gave a promise in his word i will never leave you how many has he left you this morning we don't have anybody that he's left well you need to turn around and tell the devil he's not left me and he ain't going to leave me so you might as well quit you might as well give up how many is the devil told you nobody loves you we ain't got one or two of y'all that's in church this morning with me now the devil comes and tells you nobody loves you nobody cares about you but let me just tell you you need to put that back on him nobody loves you devil nobody cares about you devil we're not here this morning to listen to you devil we come to hear from god we come here from the almighty we come to get the solution to the problem and which is bigger than us that we can't see the end but it doesn't mean that there's not an end it doesn't mean that we're going to be defeated it means that god is going to use you this morning and that problem that trial that sickness that situation to bring the best out of your life we have a promise he'll never leave us hebrews 13 5 says i will never leave thee nor forsake thee matthew 28 and verse 20 i am with you alway even unto the end of the world john 14 17 for he dwelleth with you and shall be in you and in romans 8 and verse 28 we all are aware of this and we're all very familiar scripture and we know that all things work together for the good to them that love god to them who are they called according to his purpose you say brother are you sure about that because you don't understand what i'm going through right now you don't understand my situation how in the world can this work out for my good look what it's done to me look what it's done to my family look at the struggle that i'm in but no matter what you're dealing with at this time no matter what you're going through right now the word is the word and god can't tell a lie god can't be defeated he said that all things work together and no matter what you're going through no matter how you feel this morning no matter how dark the situation may be it's working toward your good gotta take that situation and turn it around and make sure that it's gonna bless you and enjoy it and lift you up into heavenly places all things work together now know this that they're not enjoyable you don't hit a trial and just jump up and shout praise god i'm going through it no we call you an imbecile that's how we say in louisiana you're a nobody signs up for it right maybe y'all do in arkansas but we don't know louisiana but see god is working it for your good so you may be facing what appears an impossible situation and perhaps you feel completely trapped hedged and overwhelmed with no solution in sight maybe you're confronted with a challenge where there's no resolution and sometimes your heart is heavy with worry and fear and anxiety and depression and all these other things and it seems like there's nowhere to turn every time you turn it's another situation or it's another uh oppression or something of that nature maybe you're on an emotional roller coaster one minute you're up and seems to be going good all of a sudden you just dip down into the valley of despair and it seems like god has left you but god has never left you alone so no matter how the impossibilities no matter what you're facing on this side of eternity i want you to rest assured god has your best interest at heart you are the apple of his eye he's not going to put too much on you this morning in which you can't bear but notice he's the one that's with you always so impossibilities are the platforms upon which god does his best work if life was easy life would be easy we wouldn't have need of a god now would we but when life tightens up a little bit things get a little bit tough on us the pressures get a little bit tough maybe the doctor's report said we only have a few months to live that's when you got to trust in the god that does impossible math how many of you know sister dottie brown she's brother nathan bryant's mother this time last year during covert the doctors she went to the hospital and they found that she had cancer throughout her whole lymph system and they gave her two months to live church's brother nate just sent out prayer requests and we begin to pray and many other believers begin to pray and look we just came from there last weekend held a series of meetings for for brother nathan's church me and brother aaron and brother timothy and and god god begin to call her out in every service god spoke to her and they gave her two months to live and she showed up in every service and she testified on every service that he's been so good to me no matter the cancer through my body no matter what i've gone through i got so much to thank god for she embraced that challenge she embraced that struggle and said know what my god is bigger than this cancer and she just went back to the hospital just the other day for a scan i believe and they only found a little speck of it left i'm going to tell you church not even cancer can stand before our god and if cancer can't stand before no matter what you're going through this morning it can't stand before our god it can't take you down god has your best interests at heart so with man these things may be impossible but with god all things are possible you know wise man once said he said most of our blessings are hidden in a little envelope titled impossible situations nobody likes to receive that envelope you want that one that has a check in it a stimulus here and a stimulus there and you want that kind of envelope we don't sign up to try to get those impossible situation envelopes okay let me open this up and find out what my ordeal is today some grab bag but no but when god wants to do a miracle he usually puts you in a difficult situation and when god wants to do an even bigger miracle he puts you in an impossible situation therefore if you're in a situation this morning and you can't see the seem to see anything any way out you don't feel anything it seems like god's a million miles away that doesn't mean that he's a million miles away that doesn't mean that god is not behind the scenes working everything toward your good what that means is for you as the believer when you don't see god move you don't hear from god and you don't feel god that's the moment you need to be expecting any minute god is about to move on my situation because we had a word in ephesians 3 it says now to him he is able to do exceeding and abundantly above all that we can ask or even think god knows your thoughts god knows the situation and god has already provided an answer and that answer is bigger than anything you can fathom in your mind it's greater than anything that you can fathom in your mind notice now for it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle that for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of god thankfully many of us are not rich at least we're not back in louisiana some of y'all may be rich the million millionaire next door and that's fine what we find here when we think about an iv needle before i got saved and we heard this scripture as a kid growing up i think you know i'm thinking of a needle right sowing needle there ain't no way there ain't no way that that camel is going to fit through that little bitty eye of a needle but what that word needle there represents it actually is a gate in jerusalem which opens after the main gate is closed at night in order for the camel to pass through the eye of the needle to get through the second gate and enter into jerusalem that camel not only had to pass through the first gate but he also had to unload stoop down and unload everything that it had on it and then it had to squabble through on its knees to get through that needle and the prophet of god will tell us as he would say and forsaken all he says and the question lays before every one of us and jesus really asked this rich young ruler to forsake all that he had to take up his cross and follow him and we know the story and he went away sorrowful because he had great riches you know he had a lot of money and he didn't want to give up his money because with his money came fame came popularity came a lot of nice things material things and he wasn't willing to give those things up and notice he walked up into the face of eternal life and turned away turned away he had his opportunity he rejected the opportunity to follow jesus when he laid it down to him pretty strict and the prophet of god will tell us and we want to hold on to everything that we can and then follow jesus but sometimes jesus wants us to turn loose of everything so that we get both hands on him you know today we may not be rich with money we may not have nice house nights cars things i like of those sorts of things but some of you you've accumulated so much complexes oh you're rich in the wrong thing some of you got so much depression that you're rich in depression you're rich in your anxieties you're rich in your fears you're rich in all these things and i wonder tonight what could happen in this service this morning if we can take our eyes off of what we see take our eyes off of how we feel take our eyes off the situation take our eyes off the trial that we're in take our eyes off the impossibilities that lay in our humanity all the disappointments that we've encountered and it can unload in this morning unpack these things unload the depression and let go of the fear let go of the anxiety what kind of service can we have this morning talk about a god that does the impossible talk about going in to that inner gate and enjoying the joys of the lord oh church what you got to do this morning is unpack those things give those things to jesus this morning let jesus take that bird let jesus lift that off of you this morning we got to be like that camel we got to unpack these things and when we unpack these things unpack all the guilt from past failures unpack all that unforgiveness to those that hurt you you know we're christians and we we are but we're still human and as humans sometimes we harbor these little feelings somebody hurt you 15 20 years ago you've not let that thing go yet and yet you're saying i'm going to make it i'm ready for a rapture oh you ready for a rapture but you can't let go of that but god let go of so much that was on your life he forgave you so much that it was holding over you so that you can enjoy the blessings of him and yet you want to host something over somebody else oh you're rich with unforgiveness all the complexes you know many of us family strains run down through families generational curses work their way down through children but i want you to know generational curses they may have ran into your family until it ran into you and when it ran into you it stopped because you serve a mighty god many of you may know my brother-in-law was killed last month in a car accident but previous two months before that he had made contact or he had a son that we didn't know about he's a 20 year old kid at the time he was 19 and he made contact with nathan and so he made contact he wanted to meet him so they met in pensacola florida and so they got to meet each other and so the son this son who turned 20 while he was at our place he came up for the funeral and he didn't know anything about our family we didn't know anything about him but he was a spitting image to my brother-in-law when i say a spitting image i'm talking about in looks i'm talking about the mannerisms i'm talking about the way he pronounced his words the way his mouth moved does everything that he was he's in the navy my brother all went to the navy academy all these things and you wonder how can these things be when they he he my brother-in-law had no influence on this child's life but the generational strains work really deep and they really ingrained and this kid did everything like his biological father but i'm going to tell you this morning if that's the case in the natural what about the case in the supernatural when that dna comes down inside of you let me tell you we should represent the king of kings and the lord of lords and all these generational curses that our earthly father and our parents want to put on us it's got to come to an end that cycle's got to be broken and i'm looking at cycle breakers this morning it may be too big for you but it ain't too big for our god it may be too much for us the grudges the doubts the unbelief all the fears and anxieties it may be too much for us so won't you just unload it this morning won't you give it to jesus this morning say jesus this is too much for me you're the one that does the impossibilities now work this in my favor so they asked a question because straight as the gate and narrow is the way and his disciples says well who can be saved so you know what the rich man does why it's so hard for a rich man to enter into that gate because a rich man depends on his own ability the rich man trusts in his own knowledge he's putting his trust in things that he can have an influence over or he can have an effect on and he's not trusting in god but i want you know this morning you can't buy your way to heaven you can't think your way to heaven there's only one way and jesus is that way he is the way the truth and the life he is the gate and you got to unload all your worldly concerns as the prophet of god saying you got to throw down that whirly bag of peanuts and get on the train because the train is in the blocks the train is about to leave let me tell you if there's ever been a time that we as a people should be ready for the coming of the lord that time is now when we see what the world is doing we see what the world is becoming we're in the middle of pride month oh the homosexual agenda solomon gemara is right here but i want you to know this morning we are in the middle of a pride month i'm proud to be a christian i'm proud to be a believer i'm proud to have the holy ghost i'm proud to be saved i'm proud to rely on that god that does the impos i'm proud of who my father is they want their rainbow we got a covenant i'll never leave you i'll never forsake you i'll be with even in you to the end of the world oh hallelujah for it is easier for a camel to go through eye of a needle therefore a rich man to enter the kingdom of god and when the disciples heard it they were exceedingly amazed saying who then can be saved i believe i may have said this many years ago when i was here when i first came to this message 20 something years ago i didn't know i didn't grow up in a christian home i didn't know about the bible i didn't know these things and they talked about the fruits of the spirit i'm like oh my i got a fruitless tree i don't possess this this i got a temper i got this i got this man i got the wrong tree and i thought about these things but you know the longer i went the longer i stayed the longer i just i studied and fed on the word and then finally got received the baptism of the holy ghost then you realize these things start grafting into your life then you begin to push out because you're drinking in of this message and this message produces the fruits of the spirit so i was all worried about what i could do how i was going to do this how i was going to do that i was like that rich man depending on my own ability but god doesn't want your human ability god wants your human availability he wants you to be available to the call he wants you to be available to the sick he wants you to be available whenever he wants you to do something to the word he wants you to be available to him because i'm here to tell you when you look at situations sometimes your mind can't grasp the solution to the problem and you're like these disciples well then who can be saved but jesus beheld them and he said unto them with men this is impossible but with god all things are possible that word all is a small word right but it encompasses everything that you'll ever face on this side of eternity you name a problem you name a situation you name a sickness whatever it is all things are possible there's nothing that's not impossible or that's not possible with god so this word impossible here means not possible isn't that profound impossible means not possible it also means unable to be or to exist to happen unable to be done unable to be performed i'm able to be effective incapable of being true not to be done not to be endured utterly impractical and hopelessly unsuitable so what's impossible with us can't be true can't be endure can't be performed can be affected not suitable it's not the case with the god we serve so the hardest situations may seem to overwhelm us may consume our thoughts may keep you up at night how many of you've ever stressed tonight and you just toss and turn and you sweat and you strike got some honest christians here this morning thank god because we've all been there i mean we we were and we stress and we fret why when god's got it all in control it's bigger than you but it's not bigger than the god we serve we find here in mark 9 and verse 17 and one of the multitude answer and said unto said master i have brought unto thee my son which has a dumb spirit and whosoever he taketh him he teareth him and he followeth and he gnashes with teeth and he pileth away and i speak to thy disciples that they should cast him out and they could not see notice some things are not even possible with believers they could not cast him out and answered him saying oh faithless generation how long shall i be with you how long shall i suffer you bring him unto me and they brought him unto him and when he saw him straightway the spirit tear him and he fell on the ground and wallowed foaming now i don't know about you but if how many of you ever seen a spirit be cast out of a person first thing that spirit does and the prophet of god will say it when it knows that it's about to be cast out there comes a change over that person now i've been a lot of prayer lines i've i wouldn't say fortunate but i have had situations where we prayed and we've laid hands on them and we cast out devils and you find a lot of times first reaction is they pull back sometimes they growl sometimes they do this sometimes they do that just here at our easter meetings we had two in a service me and brother danny steeman was dealing with one young girl and she hit the ground when she raised up real quick she said leave me alone i said not today you're coming out because we got a commission now it may not be possible with your denominations it may not be possible with the bad news they may run from him they may run the the catholics may run from it but i'm going to tell you when you know your position in the body and god is giving you the covenant and god has commissioned you to lay hands on the sick and they shall recover you in my name can cast out devils let me tell you you go forth into battle knowing that the god that you serve is greater than the demon that's attacking that person and that little girl will receive her deliverance that day and she got up and she was completely different and we had another young girl coming to line and she had a suicidal spirit and she showed up in oklahoma camp and it didn't get dealt with but i deserved it in oklahoma camp and i told brother timothy because he had come out and he said look there's i feel like there is a spirit of suicide here and it's heavy on my heart so when this young girl came into the line i looked re i spoke in his ear said this young girl's got a suicidal spirit i don't know i didn't know her i don't even know whose church she went to at the time but it didn't get dealt with in oklahoma she came to our easter meetings and she came up in the prayer line she began to tell me and brother aaron what what happened to her and how she's feeling and what she's going through and she wants to be free of this thing let me tell you we begin to pray not only did we begin to pray we begin to cast that thing out that young girl fell down hit her head against the the pew there because see that's what satan does he's trying to kill steal and destroy no matter what and here we find in this story here this young man foameth at the mouth he throws him in the fire throws him in the water he's doing everything it can to to destroy the host that is living him before it's cast out but that young girl came into a prayer line one way but i want you to know this morning she left free she left the liver that suicidal spirit left why because god not man but god does the impossible she was looking for a solution and god had the answer in a prayer line in an easter service and he's the same god this morning and he's here this morning for your need he's as very much god as he was and william branham as he is in the fivefold ministry today he's still god he still heals he's still saved he still feels with the holy ghost and he still cast out devils because he's still god and he does the impossible now notice jesus said of times he's cast him into the fire into the waters to destroy him but if thou canst do anything have compassion on us and help us and jesus said unto excuse me i got these t-rex arms i can't even get my jacket off y'all didn't know y'all had a dinosaur preacher up here did you well there it is hallelujah jesus said unto him if thou cast believe all things are possible to him that believeth and straightway the father the child cried out and he said with tears lord i believe but help thou my unbelief and that's we find ourselves there many of us we believe but then there's that slight unbelief that tries to come in and keep the promise away from him keep it at bay but i want to say this morning like like they did this his father did lord we believe we believe but help down my unbelief help us this morning to allow our faith to rise up to realize that there's no impossibilities with you and god jesus said if thou canst believe all things are possible so the case may seem impossible for the disciples it may seem impossible for you this morning but if you can put your trust anchor it in god this morning nothing is impossible for them that believe in the message moses he said divine healing died out a while here a few years ago this is in 1950 it just let down as it happens through the age of history it's let down so often and during that time cancer broke out sickness in the church eighty percent of the people are sick now we got the best hospitals we've ever had how he says we've got the best drugs we've ever practiced with haven't we we got more sickness than we ever had haven't we because we got more on belief than we ever had we had he goes haven't we said that's right exactly only god's the healer that's right right in the days when he's got all these fine drugs and operations insurgents and so forth excuse me constantly they are building infirmities for the incurable is that right he goes and there's never was nothing that ever came before our master jesus but what he was more than a match for oh you say brother joe that lays on the side of healing i'm telling you there's nothing that ever came before our master whether it be healing whether it be deliverance whether it be a situation that our god is not more than a match for so whatever you're going through this morning your god is more than a match for what you're dealing with he says and no incurables to him all things are possible is that right and he's the same yesterday today and forever is that right then nothing is too incurable for him there's no situation that's incurable with him there's no person too far gone that's incurable for him there's no marriages that's so messed up that's not incurable with him there's nothing i like how the prophet of god said he says i never seen god go into battle but what he didn't come out packing the victory what does that tell you as a believer god can't lose and if you're in god you can't lose did you hear what i said god can't lose he's never lost a battle he's never lost a son he's never lost a sheep he's never and he can't lose you this morning so what does that tell you church you can't lose you and god are majority this morning you're undefeatable this morning you're the mighty voice of a living god you're the final voice to the final age and it's time that voice shuts the mouth of the devil and say my god is able my god is greater my god is bigger than anything that i face [Music] shut the mouth of the enemy notice now and don't you think it's just as possible for god to send down deliverance for the sick people as he did to bring out them in bondage back in the days of egypt isn't he just as kind-hearted to your cry listen to your crowd the same as he did theirs he promised in the last days that he would have a church he promised he would have a church notice not a church scarred up not a church marred up not a church wrinkled up but a church spotless a church that's wrinkle-free she's not laid down in the bed of fornication with the world no but she's without blemish he's promised that if god gave that promise then god is duty bound to keep that word all that you have to do as a believer is unload unpack all that stuff that satan's trying to pack on you the bible would tell us that god daily loadeth us with benefits there's benefits this morning with being a believer many times we don't accept those benefits we take all the negativity that the devil wants to throw on us well we know you heard it the devil's been talking to me then why are you listening he's in my ear he's telling me this he's telling me that but what has god told you service after service tape after tape wednesday night sunday god is telling you over and over now you're sons of god not we'll be in the millennium you are now and if you are a son of god now then you got more power you got more authority you got more dominion over anything that you face on this side because you serve a living god a god that can't be defeated a god that can't lose and if god can't be defeated and he can't lose you can't either church recognize your position recognize your authority recognize the anointing by which you're under this board and stand toe-to-toe with that devil and say my god's able we're not gonna bow i don't know what he's got plans for hey if it's a fiery furnace heat it up seven times harder it don't matter to me let me tell you pharaoh let me tell you nebuchadnezzar i refuse to bow let me tell you joe biden kamala harris i refuse to bow let me tell you politics let me tell you homosexual agenda we refuse to bow god is able he's able oh i just believe he will because he does the impossible notice he promised in the last days that he would have a church these signs would follow them isn't that right well don't you think the last days are here don't you think that come on church how many y'all got a mouth this morning so y'all know y'all afraid to talk come on i'm not afraid to a hearty amen you ain't gonna scare me out of the pulpit by shouting it's all right i like a good heart amen to the word come on get behind it this morning pull from the gift of god what you have need of it says isn't it time now for these things to happen so if we believe that we're in the last days then shouldn't we be looking for god to perform his word if we believe that we're in the last day shouldn't we expect signs and wonders to follow the ministry shouldn't we believe to follow those that believe if we're in the last days shouldn't we believe shouldn't we be expecting a god to do the impossible shouldn't we be expecting another great expectation for god to work miracles in our lives oh we sing that song he's a waymaker he's a miracle worker is it let me tell you it's got to be more than a soul it's got to be a revelation my god is a wave maker when i don't see a way through this storm when i don't swing away through my trout god's already made a way let me tell you he'll split the red seas for you he'll open up the line still god is a wave maker and a miracle worker this morning there's nothing too big that our god can't move listen what he says here the doctor is working on the line of scientific now i know i'm dealing with healing but i want you to apply this healing to any situation because if he's a divine healer he's a divine savior and if he's a divine savior he can cast out devils he can heal the sick he can change any situation he can change any storm so he says now the doctor is working on on the line of scientific the doctor has done everything he can to save the person's life and it can't be saved because there's nothing else he knows to do he's at the end of his wits the man is honest but now the tree of knowledge is all right but when you go so far as it'll go then step off onto the tree of life and just keep going sister dottie got an ugly doctor's report you got two months she stepped off that tree of knowledge said i'm gonna believe in a god it does impossible she's still living today 70 80 years old somewhere like that she's not a spring chicken but she's believing in a living god got up at the end of our services after she had sat through three services and we're not talking a 30-minute little dissertation or some sermonette by some preacher we talk about anointed services and she got up at the end said i want to give a testimony and she ain't saying if i'm not mistaken she hasn't sang since she's gotten cancer and recovered this is her first time and she gets up and grabs them like all feeble at first i got so much oh but then that anointing here to thank him for so much to praise him for and just begin to change the atmosphere in that church oh people were on their feet rejoicing because they know what the doctor said they know how dire the situation was but they seen a living god in action and if god is that kind of god there in indiana what kind of god is he in arkansas he's the same god he's the same healer he's the same deliverer he's the same waymaker oh church the problem is though that that we get weak when it comes down time to the battle we pull back we don't believe brother bram said now watch the order of the word he says and you shall you shall receive it shall have it first you got to believe that you got it you got to believe that you got it easy for us to believe for somebody else correct brother david you almost lost your life to covet you was one step into the grave but god sustained you but you your family has to have the faith to believe that if god can do it for somebody else then god can do it for me god can do it for my family member god can do it for my family let me tell you that's the kind of faith that we got to have not just for somebody else but god you're as much god for me this morning as you were for that brother as you weren't for that sister god work into my heart working my life work in this situation god i don't see an answer but you are the answer to the problem and god was the answer to your covet and god sustains you god allowed you and coveted to meet in the middle and guess what happened you came out victorious oh satan has thrown his best at god's people but he ain't got enough this morning church let me tell you no matter what you're facing the devil don't have enough he don't have enough hounds or hell he don't have enough sickness he don't have enough depression he don't have enough anxiety to destroy a son and daughter of god he don't have enough because we serve a god of impossibilities we serve almighty god he says first you got to receive it you got to believe it and when you come and make your confession believe god believe that he will do it and he's under obligation to do it god is worth no more than his word no man is worth any more than his word and god is infallible he cannot lie excuse me his word is true and we just accept him by his word and believe it and it's got to happen he said it will happen if we believe it and we'll act upon our conviction but notice he said what's the matter is we christians we get too weak when it comes down to the showdown if it's real if it's real it's real let me go ahead and tell you this message is real he said bro joe how do i know that because i know what it's done for me i was going one way i was going down to a sinner's grave in the devil's hell but this word gotta hold in my heart turn my life around change my desires change my nature i don't desire the things i used to desire i don't look at the things i used to look at i don't drink the things i used to drink i don't smoke the things i used to smoke why because this word it works today church it's the same word that healed in the days of jesus it's the same word that delivered in the days of william brother and it's the same word today the same anointing the same holy ghost the same power and the same authority but we believe word of life tabernacle i believe we can say we believe it we believe it's real we believe in a living god we believe in a god that does a supernatural we believe in god that is supernatural we believe in a god that heals we believe in a god that delivers and we believe in the power of the holy ghost to transform lives we believe sorry devil you came too late we already believe oh it may be impossible it may be impossible for the denominations i got a very good friend of mine he's a baptist pastor probably one of my best friends we go hunting all the time together and one day we were turkey hunting how many y'all know sister atlanta butts in our church she was delivered from stage four lymphoma cancer and he and i were talking about and i was telling him the testimony how god came down and healed her he said you believe god healed her i said are you stupid she was had a death sentence on her yeah i believe god healed so you believe it's god's will to heal i said absolutely i believe it's god's will to heal and now the baptists don't believe that way they believe that if it is god's will he will heal they don't believe that it is his will to heal but when jesus sent his disciples out he told them to heal the sick to cast out devils feeler you give freely you receive so he gave the commission to heal the sick so it is god's will to heal so i say that to say the denominations may not have that revelation they may not have that authority it may be impossible with them but there is a god that heals today there is a god that sets free today there is a god that delivers today and there is a god that cast out spirits so what would they do in the denomination realm they sent them to a hospital they'll put them in an insane ward because they don't have the authority or the power or the revelation by which god gave the disciples to cast out devils to lay hands on the sick and they shall recover that's not no preacher's word that's not brother branham's word that's god's word that's jesus word to his followers you do these things they will not fall and so that's why we do these things that's why we line up to the word now notice the angel lord came to brother branham one time and he said now look if you can get to people to believe then nothing will stand before your prayer not even cancer back then they didn't have the the medical science that they do today for cancer treatment so usually back then when person somebody got cancer that person normally died but you realize we're not talking about normal we're talking about a god of impossibilities so this this angel came and told our prophet that if you can get the people to believe if you can elevate their faith that they can believe in a supernatural god a god that does the impossible then nothing will stand before your prayer not even cancer now today churches want to they want to go back and say that was only for william branham i disagree with that i believe that word that message is as much as the 5-fold ministry today as it was to him then if i can get you to believe this morning that you're healed then you can receive that healing and if i can get you to believe this morning that that situation is already resolved then that situation will be resolved for you this morning if i can only get you to believe then you can have whatever things you ask for but your faith has got to be elevated look away from your situations look away from your sickness look away from how you feel and look to jesus this morning he's the author and the finisher of our faith he says now if i can get you to believe not worked up to not a thought in your mind but what you really know the very evidence of things not seen and we got we got churches now around the message preachers churches that don't believe in telling about the supernatural now i'm not going to get through all this today i thought i would but my goodness y'all pulling too good notice now their churches and preachers that don't believe in telling about the supernatural they shy away and even frown on telling about current day miracles that god's performing what do they say well that's only for brother branham either we're included in the promise or we're not either we're sons and daughters of god or not either the promise is unto them that believe or it's only to him that believe i happen to think it's for them i happen to put my place there and say you know what i believe i've already seen it with my own eyes i've witnessed it but they claim what they claim is this man drawing attention away from the prophet and putting the attention on his own ministry and his own gifts but let me ask you how will we ever get to people to believe in a supernatural god if we don't tell about the miracles if we don't tell about the healings if we don't make known the deliverances has taken place how will your faith ever rise up well we got the word brother joe yeah the word you got the letter the letter killeth but we want the letter and the spirit mixed together because the spirit anoints the word to live and what is the anointing of the spirit is signs following the believer it's miracles taking place it's the supernatural coming behind that letter and saying all right live again son of man can these dry bones live absolutely they can live oh it was just a ladder then but when the ladder when when the anointing breathed across that valley of dry bones let me tell you sin you became back to those dry bones they begin to rattle they begin to move they begin to come to life let me tell you there may be some dry bulls in this house this morning but i'm going to tell you there's an anointing that can sweep through this building and dry bones can come to life and send you and vote and muscle and life breathe back into your heart breathe back into your soul breathe back into your families let me tell you our god is able church don't put this in a day of 50 years ago only on a prophet it's more than able today he's the god of the impossibility right now this morning this service for your need don't put god in the box say he don't move today yes he does he's every bit the same god see it's not man taking credit for these things but it's god working through man these things are not possible with man i can't come put my hands on you and deserve what you're going through unless it be god i can't come put my hands on you and cast out that spirit because i don't know what you got unless it be god i can't pray for you for healing unless it be god so it has nothing to do with man man is only god's agent by which he uses to perform his word but we want to put it all off one man and i respect our prophet but i also respect every time he pointed us to christ because he knew one day he was off the scene he'd be off the scene but jesus would never walk off the scene because he said i'll never leave you i'll never forsake you i'll be with you even to the end of the age church we're at the end of the age and he's still with us we have that promise he's not left us notice man doesn't possess any special power to heal to save man is under this unction of the holy spirit and can only be used by god to make these things come to pass whether it be healing whether it be salvation whether it be deliverance it's all god and we find they don't want to declare but the bible tells us to declare these things psalms 105 and verse 1 says make known his deeds among the people psalms 89 and verse 1 i will sing of his mercies excuse me i will sing of the mercies of the lord forever oh well we can't preach about it i guess we can sing about it well i wish i could sing because i'd sing right now i told the church the other day i preached the other day and i had a dream before i preached it was saturday night i had my dream man i could preach i mean i could sing oh it was so lovely and i woke up the next morning i was so disappointed scratch out i guess i'll just preach god knows who he can and can't give gifts to but we find here i will sing of the mercies of the lord forever with my mouth will i make known thy faithfulness to all generations not stop at 65 but to all generations psalms 96 and verse 3 declare his glory among the heathen his wonders among all people psalms 145 and verse 4 one generation shall praise our works to another otherwise tell the other generation about the powers of god what god did how he opened the red sea how he slayed 600 under sham guard how samson defeated 1 000. let me tell you declare make known these wonderful works of god one generation shall praise thy works to another and shall clear thou mighty acts i will speak of the glorious honor of thy majesty i know thy wonders works psalms 145 and verse 11 they shall speak of the glory of thy kingdom and talk of thy power to make known to the sons of men his mighty acts and the glorious majesty of his kingdom oh church don't you shy away of the supernatural don't you shy away a testifying what god has done and what god is doing you know the prophet of god nailed it when he says you know man is always looking back to see what god had done oh we can always look back and see what god has done he said he's always looking forward to see what god is going to do oh god is going to do this and god is going to do that but we ignore man ignores what god is doing right now i mean don't be guilty of ignoring the supernatural in our midst god is healing cancer god is delivering god is bringing home the prodigal god is still moving god is still working i've seen it time and time again god is doing these things so let me read some testimonies to you before i close that okay it's okay that our closer is okay let's read the testimonies that's a trick question don't answer don't answer you'll be in trouble how many you know sister beth dingwell maybe a couple of you know her sister beth dingwall she goes to brother bischo's church been there all her life years ago as a child she had this form it's called lymphomastic leukemia it's only is in children the survival rate is zero every child that ever got this form of leukemia never made it out alive they got the same treatment in hospital rooms well there was something different about this child because this child was part of a believing family this child was part of a believing church and i believe in family and i believe in church sought the horns of the altar and began to pray and begin to believe and suture beth dengue is the only known survivor of this form of leukemia and when she when she recovered from it they had to go in and change the record books now it's one in a million let me tell you she was at one and it may be that you're the one in your situation but god still does the impossible now i asked you this morning won't one of you go and tell her that god doesn't do miracles too late because she is one she's witnessed the power of god she her life should have been taken from her because satan put a death sentence on her but i'm going to tell you god changes the devil's plans satan can put only so much on he can only come so far but with god all things are possible how many of you are familiar with brother gary walker whether gary walker is a preacher in new zealand he was involved in a serious car accident while traveling home from some services he and his wife and his daughter i believe they were in a car accident and his wife looked over at him and he was lifeless he's already dead and he had turned gray and he's completely his eyes rolled back in the back of his head not breathing perfectly still blood oozing out of his nose and something spoke to her pray for him and she tried to put her arm on him but her arm was broken it couldn't move and her and her daughter began to pray the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man and brother gary came back to life life breathed back into him and he began to gurgle in his blood people arrived on the scene and she said she they took us out of the wreck emergency service began to arrive and he died again now he didn't die twice satan was he was determined no matter how determined he is our god is more than determined there was a piece of excuse me a piece of paper found in gary's clothes recordings gary status state he was deceased at 5 48 p.m i would have kept that for a trophy arriving at the emergency department his wife was informed that gary had a severe head injury he had error in the brain bleeding in the brain a large hemorrhage in the skull multiple broken bones including the temporal bone the orbitals the sinuses his palate was split he had a broken shoulder blade this gloving of tissue from his right arm fractured t12 spine fractured ribs shattered right pelvis fractured left leg kneecap tendons were torn off his right shoulder and his left knee he was in pretty bad shape gary's nurse in the emergency room took his wife in to see him for what would be the very last time is with him alive he had already died twice and he wasn't expected to live he was on life support and was unrecognizable but with your darkest mouth that's when jesus comes on the scene notice she didn't settle and the family didn't settle and the church didn't settle for the report that the doctors gave he's not going to recover he's not going to recover he's not going to recover but god came on the scene and they were told many times that he wouldn't even improve okay he made it he lived he wouldn't improve but after two years of the trauma he continues to slowly improve he rarely slurs his words when tried he walks more steadily he's recently noticed freeing of the stiffness in his left hip his right knee gives him a lot less pain he's gaining more use of his left hand it can lift his arm well over his head and he still preaches inspired sermons oh satan had a plan for gary walker but god has a greater plan god says i'm going to put you gary and that problem gary and i'm going to work something supernatural in gary's own words he said he was at a very dark time in the hospital and he made his complaint known to god like any of us would right why me why didn't you just kill me why didn't you just take me and the voice spoke back to him and said if you knew the big picture you would volunteer for this sometimes i wonder if we're so shallow we're so worried about us and not realizing the big picture what a testimony of what god has done in gary walker's life a man who died twice wasn't expected to make it a third time and he still lives and he was told he wasn't gonna have any quality of life and he's still living and he's improving and he's preaching inspired sermons in the face of the enemy he's still ministering the gospel in the face of everything he's gone through he's declared that our god does impossibilities we all know the story of brother ron the angel of the lord came to brother ron told him if you trust me with your life i'll use you like never before this time last year i think it was maybe just around december november or december of 2019 if i'm not mistaken and he was diagnosed with cancer and his lymph nodes and his lungs and i think it went from his lungs to his brain so this man has got cancer throughout his body but if you've been watching services at the last several months this man is preaching under such an anointing not somebody who's up all night throwing up because of the chemo treatments so brother tim and i are having a conversation of the day and you know we're wondering when is ron going to receive his healing and i looked at brother tim i said you know let me tell you now this is me telling my pastor we all know my pastor is a very staunch believer and he's a very firm man and i just said you know god told him if you trust me with your life i'll use you like never before i said if god would have healed ron spencer in three months that's not using him like never before but in the face of the enemy in the face of all his sickness in the face of his sugar going up and down in the face of that devil trying to destroy his life with lung cancer brain cancer sugar issues throwing up all in the middle of the night god is using his servant more than ever before he's preaching more inspired sermons elevating the faith of the people and if ron spitzer can do it you can do it too and if god is the god of impossibility and a man that was supposed to die he only was given four months and he's still living what about your situation what about your family what about your need this morning he's a god of impossibility he's a weight maker he's a miracle worker and he's on time for you this morning he's on the scene for you this morning you say brother joe do you not believe that he's going to get his healing i absolutely do believe but i believe god had an appointment ron spencer cancer you're going to meet together because god's going to use this problem and he's going to do the impossible with it god's going to do the supernatural with ron spencer's testimony and his ministry and i'm telling you i've watched and i've listened i've gleaned and i've seen what god has done and the inspiration behind every sermon i'm here to tell you god is doing great things but it ain't only for ron spencer it's for whosoever will he's as much god this morning for you for your situation for your need is as he is for ron for gary walker for beth dingle for whatever let me bring this down to a close he said now my business is not to figure out how god is going to do it how god is going to make a way god will do it somehow how are you if you're dying with heart trouble how are you going to get well when a doctor says that you can't live another week i don't know but god will provide god will make a way he's still jehovah chira he's still jehovah jireh he still provides oh many times we think god has forsaken us told abraham take your son oh man y'all waited 25 years and here he is now i want you to take him when he's about 13. i want you to tie his hands together i want you to walk him over this mountain go about 90 to 100 miles and take him up in his heart this tall mouth and i want you to sacrifice your only son abraham said yes lord i'll do it he believed that he gave me isaac as one from the dead and surely if he was to take his life he can raise him again and notice they get to the top of the mountain before they go up he looked at his servant he said the lad and i are going to go yonder to worship and the lad and i will return see abraham didn't stagger at the situation abraham wasn't trembling as he was walking those hundred miles knowing what laid the head of him no abraham had his faith anchored in god and if i can get you to anchor your faith this morning and god and all the storms of life they may blow they may beat against your ship but they can't shake you they won't turn you loose from the promise of god and abraham went up there steadfast never staggered at the promises of god stroked his little hair back laid him down on the altar began to pull that knife back and the angel the lord caught his hand said abraham stay thy hand i know now that you love me see sometimes god's just waiting till the last minute to see if you believe to see if you really care to see if you really honor that word and when he did a lan a ram bladed over in the bushes god provided and he's very much god this morning for you and your situation as he was for abraham he's still jehovah jair he's still a waymaker he's still a need supplier now let me get down to this i'm gonna bring this to a close i gotta skip a lot but let me bring us down john six verse one after these things jesus went over the sea of galilee which is the sea of tiberias and a great multitude followed him because they saw his miracles which he did on them that were deceased lord disease excuse me disease jesus went up into the mountain and there he sat with the disciples and the passover and the feast of the jews was nigh and when jesus lifted up his eyes he saw a great company come unto him and he saith unto philip when shall we buy bread that these may eat and this is he said this to prove him for he himself knew what he would do and philip answered 200 penny worth of bread is not sufficient for them that every one of them may take a little and one of the disciples andrew simon peter's brother said unto him there is a lad here which has five barley loaves and two small fishes but what are they among so many you know many times we find ourselves in phillips place lord we got all this look at this there's no wave it's 200 penny worth all we got is five five loaves and two fishes i mean you may be jesus and all but really let's think about this that's a lot of people i'm doing it in our modern day all right preacher you plan on doing this that's impossible there's no way but we find ourselves just like philip in a difficult situation a difficult time we look at the crowd we look at the task at hand we look at how impossible it seems and we never realize who's with us we never realize jesus has already performed miracle after miracle after miracle after miracle and how common does the supernatural become when we've seen it over and over and over so jesus wasn't concerned about their lack of what they had he wasn't distraught about they didn't have enough money for the provision he's not concerned with what you lack he's not concerned about you not having money you're not having this that or the other he's only testing your faith do you believe that i will do what i said i will do notice he performed many miracles already in their midst and yet like us they were looking at the impossibility because they're looking through the eyes of man the finite mind there's no way they saw this one and that one and this one and that one as far as the eye can see 5 000 people 200 penny worth and many times brother batman says many times trouble strikes our home but he says it's a blessing in disguise and some people might say well you're sick just because you're sick he says just because you're not right with god he said that doesn't mean that job was right with god and he was sick but it's god testing you putting your putting you to the test to see what you'll do maybe he let the doctor say that for a purpose to see what you would do he never asked a question will i have a church will i have righteousness but he said will i find faith so he's looking for one thing church he's looking for word of life tabernacle to have faith to believe what he said he would do 200 penny worth well this is all we got we don't have enough we don't have enough resources we're insufficient god won't you just send everybody away let them go to their own homes we don't have enough and that's how we act sometimes you know i know as a preacher sometimes you feel you feel incapable what can i do what can i what can i give these people well when you take that kind of mindset it's not you anyway you have to remind yourself you've been anointed for this you've been called you've been chosen you've been elected it's not you that's obligated to feed the people he's obligated so i come this morning not with notes from joe adams but inspiration from the angel of the lord to speak these things to tell you that he's still god today and there was a lad there he only had five five barley loaves and two small fishes but what are these among so many how are we lord we don't have the money and all we got is five this little boy took five loaves that morning went he skipped school and he went down and he caught a couple fish in the river and you know here he is he's here to see what you're gonna do with it but we find this little boy was right on time god never misses the moment he's always on time when it looks impossible he's on time when it looks as distraught and a despair as you are he's always owned time he said how could a man take five little fish or five little pieces of fish and five biscuits and two pieces of fish and break them and feed five thousand not wiggling fish now i want you to get this this is how the proper describes this but cooked fish he says 5 000 people out of two fish he took those little fellas broke it off handed it out broke off another piece and every time he break it off another piece it had growed on cooked fish already cooked fried in crisco ready to go ready growed it all what a person i said if god can do that then oh my god can do that today cook fish even put them in crisco friedman broke it off and fed 5 000. he said now not break off raise up some wheat and go cook it and things like that the regular procedure but he could bypass all that just break off cooked bread hand it out to them with brown crust on it take it and eat oh my what a god of impossibilities notice now ordered two fishing five loaves among so many it all depends as i bring this down to a close of whose hands it's in it all depends we think for a minute give me a basketball i don't know i look like spudwell up here right i don't know who's well he's about five foot six he was a basketball nba player many years ago but you give me a basketball it may be worth 15 20 bucks in my hand stick it in steph curry's hand it'll be worth 30 to 40 million i know i may be saying some names you i don't know don't go google them it's okay i'm just taking my word for it this morning maybe you give me a football it may be worth 10 or 11 bucks i may be able to throw it 20 feet but you put that same football in peyton manning's hand it's worth 50 or 60 million are you giving me a golf club how many of you ever heard of tiger woods i had a golf club in my hand it made depends on how much i want to spend it maybe 100 to 120 bucks but you put that same golf club in tiger woods hands it'll win the u.s open and 80 million dollars you give me a stick and put it in my hand i may be able to beat a wild dog way but you put that same stick in the prophet moses it'll split the red sea oh let me tell you church here it is it all depends on whose hands it's sin you give me a slingshot or it may look like a little kid toy but you put that same slingshot in the hands of david a giant slayer and those shots have to fall every time why it all depends on whose hands it's in you give me a couple nails right now i may be able to build you a birdhouse i may be able to attach something on the wall but you take those same two nails and you drive them through the hands of jesus christ it brings eternal redemption it brings salvation it brings death hell and the grave back to a living people i mean it all depends on whose hands it's in and your worries and your cares and those things that you stressed about if you leave them in your hands that's all that they'll ever be but if you put those same worries those same cares those same troubles in the hands of jesus he will do the impossible musicians can come the prophet of god will say this 1965 heard but now i see we find that in those hours of real stress usually when the spirit of god moves in he goes that's usually when the spirit of god moves in he let the hebrew children walk walk right into the fiery furnace before he ever moved to hand but when he moves he moves did you hear me church when he moves he moves there ain't enough devils in hell ain't enough politics ain't enough disappointments in life ain't enough sickness that can tack your body when god moves he moves problems said god will answer in a time of crisis he will not only answer but he will make manifest in the time of crisis if the people will assemble together no matter if two or three whatever it is and pray there he said he wouldn't he said we would hear from heaven now notice we go back here and we find that when they filled when they were done passing out the fishes and the loaves jesus said now i want you to go gather up the fragments i want you to go gather up the fragments fragments wow we only had two fish when we had five loaves you talking about fragments oh they went out and they began to gather up 12 baskets full what am i telling you oh it looked like 5 000 was more than enough let me tell you our god is more than enough this morning he's more than enough to feed the 5 000 he's more than enough to heal the sick he's more than enough to heal cancer he's more than enough to restore broken marriage he's more than enough go out and i want you to take up the fragments this morning take up the fragments 12 baskets for it proves that god is more than enough for your situation and he does the impossibilities [Music] he does the impossible and i asked you this morning you got a need this morning i believe in a god that does miracles i believe in a god that heals the sick i believe in a god that saves the lost i believe in the supernatural god if you got a need and you need prayer i'm here to pray with you but not only may i believe the angel of the lord will meet you here and take care of that situation and take care of that problem and take care of that sickness and take care of that lost son or daughter i believe i believe do you believe do you believe this morning brother brown makes this last as i end this with this quote he said that ought to be the achievement of every believer this afternoon god is able to keep every word that he said he'd do i don't care what the denominations say days is miracles is past all this is telepathy or telepathy all of his fortune telling it doesn't matter to me what they say i still believe if that gun is zero to the target it'll hit the target and i believe if if the believer is zero with with the word of god it'll hit the same thing if the word of god ever promised it he'll do it again i'm fully persuaded i'm fully persuaded this morning church that god will do what he said he'll do he does the impossible he does impossible math you may not have the answer but that's okay you don't have the end this is the time the only time that you're able to cheat on the test and look over on god's word and say oh hallelujah there's the answer when john looked past the curtain of time oh and the seals were torn off the book john looked at there's the answer i see my name and all heaven everything in heaven and under heaven and on there all things heard john shouted glory to god i've seen my name there i made it or the devil said i'm not good enough the devil said i'll never amount to anything but i made it i see my name there oh hallelujah see this can't take me because i see my name there depression can't have me i see my name there i see my name i see the answer time you're not of this world if you ever was a son of god you always was a son of god if you ever belong to god if you ever was a thought in the mind of god you always was a thought oh hallelujah church you need
