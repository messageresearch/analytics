[39:01] we're at today
[39:03] and what god can do for us judges 16 23
[39:06] then the lords of the philistines
[39:08] gathered them together
[39:10] for to offer a great sacrifice and to
[39:12] dagging their god and to rejoice
[39:15] for they said our god hath delivered
[39:17] samson our enemy
[39:19] into our hand when the people saw him
[39:21] they praised their god
[39:23] they said our god hath delivered into
[39:25] our hands our enemy and the destroyer of
[39:27] our country
[39:28] which slew many of us came to pass when
[39:31] their hearts were married that they said
[39:33] call for samson
[39:34] he may make a sport and called for
[39:37] samson out of the prison house
[39:39] he made them sport and they set in
[39:41] between the pillars
[39:42] and samson said unto the lad that held
[39:44] him by the hand suffer me that i may
[39:46] feel
[39:47] the pillars whereupon the house standeth
[39:49] that i may lean upon them
[39:50] now the house was full of men and women
[39:52] and all the lords of the philistines
[39:54] were there
[39:55] they were upon the roof of about three
[39:56] thousand men and women
[39:58] that beheld while samson made sport
[40:01] samson called unto the lord and said o
[40:03] lord god
[40:04] remember me i pray thee and strengthen
[40:06] me i pray thee only this once
[40:09] oh god that i may be at once avenged of
[40:11] the philistines
[40:13] for my two eyes and samson took hold of
[40:16] the two
[40:16] middle pillars upon which the house
[40:18] stood and on which it was born up of the
[40:20] one with his right hand the other with
[40:22] his left
[40:23] and samson said let me die with the
[40:25] philistines
[40:26] and he bowed himself with all his might
[40:29] the house fell upon the lords and upon
[40:31] all the people that were therein
[40:33] so the dead which he slew at his death
[40:34] were more than they which flew in his
[40:37] life
[40:38] i'd like to talk to you this morning
[40:39] about revival once again and
[40:41] conditions for revival pray the lord
[40:44] would add his blessing to the word you
[40:45] may be seated
[40:46] this morning
[40:50] i want us to think about revival
[40:54] as being life coming back
[40:58] into the individual or to the church
[41:02] not as as being a meeting or
[41:05] as brother branham called it a
[41:06] protracted meeting or just a set of
[41:08] services but revival being life
[41:12] coming back into the church because
[41:15] without the life of the vine
[41:18] nothing now what jesus said he said
[41:20] without me you can do nothing
[41:22] and so the revival is life in the church
[41:26] now the philistines and we talked about
[41:28] it last sunday how
[41:30] that they did three things to samson
[41:32] they put out his eyes
[41:33] they bound him with fetters with fetters
[41:36] of brass and
[41:37] but isaac had pointed out to me on last
[41:39] week that that
[41:41] spoke of judgment and it does that it
[41:43] was
[41:44] fetters of brass and then they made him
[41:47] work for them he was grinding
[41:48] corn at the meal and this was the
[41:51] condition of the church and i want us to
[41:53] think about this
[41:55] in a denominational realm this was the
[41:57] condition
[41:58] of the church before the message of the
[42:01] hour
[42:03] this was the condition of the church
[42:05] prior to the coming
[42:07] of a message of the hour brother branham
[42:10] taught it said it was the
[42:12] it was the condition of the pentecostal
[42:13] church
[42:15] even though they had emotion they had
[42:16] lots of things
[42:18] even back then when he when he preached
[42:20] i would have enjoyed those services that
[42:22] they had back then
[42:23] but he could see something coming and so
[42:26] you could see that
[42:27] it would be what it is today and so
[42:30] brother random taught us that that cycle
[42:32] of revival and death
[42:33] had never failed so it's something that
[42:38] revival would come and then they they
[42:40] denominated they organized
[42:42] brother members said every time they did
[42:44] it died
[42:45] but now we know that this message broke
[42:48] the death cycle
[42:50] when it comes to i'm talking about the
[42:53] bride as a whole the church as a whole
[42:55] the message broke that and the reason
[42:58] why i say that is because there won't be
[43:00] another message
[43:01] come to bring revival right there can't
[43:04] be
[43:05] there can't be another another message
[43:08] to bring revival there will be another
[43:09] luther another wesley another
[43:11] prophet of the hour and the age this
[43:13] this is it
[43:15] so this one has to go up right and we'll
[43:19] talk about it more in a moment but that
[43:20] bride that come when
[43:22] when brother brandon saw the preview of
[43:23] the bride and he sees it how that it
[43:26] come around the first time
[43:27] and then he saw the church and all that
[43:29] it was going down into hell
[43:30] and then he sees the bride again the
[43:33] alpha and the omega bride
[43:34] that the bride had to be the same where
[43:36] did she go she went up
[43:38] she can't go down because this is it
[43:42] right this is it now the
[43:45] the message broke that death cycle but
[43:48] yet we we in ourselves
[43:50] we go through those cycles of revival
[43:52] and death
[43:54] even in our own hearts and our own
[43:55] churches but the age doesn't the age
[43:58] goes
[43:58] up and so there's something that we can
[44:00] be a part of today that is
[44:02] life the life is back in the vine
[44:06] it may not look like it because of the
[44:08] age that we're living in it's the very
[44:09] end time it's the time when the seed
[44:11] is coming to its maturity so you may not
[44:14] see it
[44:14] like it was when it was coming up out of
[44:16] the ground it may not grow as quickly
[44:18] but there's life there
[44:20] the life has left the shock we've seen
[44:23] that the life is entirely in the seed
[44:28] are you with me so far so now the age
[44:32] doesn't get a revival they're going down
[44:36] and that's why we know that no matter
[44:37] what happens in this coming election
[44:39] let me god when it's over but no matter
[44:41] what happens there won't be a revival
[44:45] to this age it won't be a revival to
[44:46] this land
[44:48] because this this country has turned
[44:50] down god many years ago
[44:53] so there's there's no revival but now
[44:56] we have a message that broke that death
[44:58] cycle that will never be bound by
[45:00] denominational feathers
[45:02] and there's no need of a restoration to
[45:05] what has already been restored
[45:08] but we have to be restored to that
[45:12] are you with me now so i put it this way
[45:15] a few weeks ago that
[45:16] we have to participate in our revival
[45:21] let me say that clearly where you can
[45:23] understand it we must
[45:24] participate in our revival
[45:30] now you and i personally deal with this
[45:33] cycle
[45:34] and brother branham says it this way in
[45:36] spiritual amnesia
[45:37] he said now look i want to ask you
[45:39] something
[45:40] he said what if he does come tonight he
[45:44] said oh say he isn't coming i don't know
[45:45] whether he is or not he said this
[45:47] is the last sign he said remember thus
[45:50] saith the lord did you ever hear me say
[45:52] that but what it was true
[45:54] you are seeing your last sign that
[45:57] scriptural
[45:58] he said you've seen your last sign
[46:00] pentecost
[46:02] don't get mixed up now with what he
[46:03] promised israel after the rapture that
[46:05] ain't you
[46:07] he said you're done then he said see now
[46:10] is your day
[46:11] now get this now is your day now it's
[46:14] your time
[46:16] don't reject it don't do it he said you
[46:19] better come
[46:20] he said you believe me to be god's
[46:21] servant remember he's in birmingham
[46:24] alabama he said birmingham i've never
[46:25] met nicer people
[46:26] you're the nicest people i would want to
[46:28] meet in my life but you need a revival
[46:32] well i thought he said this was their
[46:34] last sign but they had to be revived to
[46:36] it
[46:37] they weren't catching it i wonder today
[46:39] are we catching the inspiration of it
[46:41] can we see
[46:42] the possibility of it is there something
[46:44] inside of us calling out to that
[46:46] is there something that allows us to
[46:47] participate in that bride revival
[46:50] he said you're he said you're the nicest
[46:53] people i would want to meet in my life
[46:54] but you need a revival you're dying
[46:56] you're taking spiritual amnesia you're
[46:58] dying don't do that
[46:59] revive that what you've got bring it up
[47:02] again
[47:02] quickly before jesus comes
[47:06] so now you say well what's the
[47:07] difference well the difference is we're
[47:09] not
[47:10] waiting on a shaking revival the revival
[47:13] is here
[47:16] and i've always tied it back in and
[47:17] forgive me for repeating myself but it's
[47:19] such a clear type
[47:20] when jesus walks down to the man at the
[47:22] pool of bethesda
[47:24] and here is thousands of people waiting
[47:27] on the moving of the water
[47:28] the angel would come down in a certain
[47:30] season and move the water
[47:32] and they had to wait on that and as they
[47:33] were waiting they were waiting on that
[47:35] revival to come the welsh revival the
[47:37] pentecost were all these revivals
[47:39] they waited until that moment when the
[47:41] revival would come and then they would
[47:42] wait
[47:42] and as they waited then all of a sudden
[47:44] here was the angel trouble in the water
[47:46] and the first one in got healed
[47:49] right but jesus walked down there one
[47:51] day and he began to walk among
[47:53] those those people those multitudes that
[47:55] were laying there
[47:56] and he walked them home and he comes to
[47:58] one man
[48:00] and he comes to that one soul that was
[48:02] predestined by god
[48:03] and when he comes to him he said will
[48:05] you be made well
[48:07] do you want to be well and he said yes i
[48:09] do but there's no one to take me to the
[48:11] water he said but
[48:12] but take your bed and walk and he walked
[48:14] away and jesus left
[48:16] and from that day till this there's
[48:18] never been a time in history
[48:20] that the water moved again why because
[48:23] the angel that moved the water was
[48:25] present
[48:28] are you with me now that's the hour that
[48:30] we live in the
[48:31] angel that moved the water is here and
[48:34] brother branham didn't come to show us
[48:35] himself he come to show us that christ
[48:37] was here
[48:38] and then if he's here he's a healer if
[48:40] he's here he's a savior
[48:42] if he's here he can bring revival if
[48:44] he's here it's just right there
[48:45] but we got to participate in it so the
[48:48] man he come to the man he's come to us
[48:50] today
[48:50] he showed us the message of the hour but
[48:52] he says do you want to be well
[48:55] huh do you want to participate in the
[48:56] bride's revival will you
[48:58] be a part of it and then you if you're
[49:00] the bride you've got to say yes
[49:02] there's something inside of you that
[49:04] says yes that's for me
[49:07] now brother branham and works as faith
[49:10] expressed
[49:12] speaks of a dream that he had he said i
[49:15] had a dream the other
[49:16] morning i don't dream very often i'm not
[49:17] a dreamer but i dreamed that i seen a
[49:19] man a young fellow in shackles
[49:22] and he was trying to get out and i said
[49:23] somebody told me
[49:25] said those are horrible people don't
[49:26] have nothing to do with them
[49:28] he said i've seen this young fellow
[49:30] getting out of his shackle so i just let
[49:31] him alone
[49:33] i thought i'll just see what he does so
[49:35] when he got out he was a nice fellow
[49:38] he said and seen others trying to get
[49:39] out
[49:41] now see the people in those shackles
[49:43] they were acting horribly
[49:45] but they brother branham didn't know
[49:47] what kind of people they were
[49:49] if they would be released and he saw a
[49:51] young man that got out while he was a
[49:53] nice fellow he was just bound
[49:56] right and so many times we prejudge
[49:57] people based on when they're bound
[50:00] but if you can hear the voice of the
[50:01] word today you can see that you can be
[50:03] free from that
[50:05] but you've got to acknowledge that the
[50:07] word is true and say lord
[50:08] help me and and listen
[50:12] for the sound of freedom and now so
[50:15] brother branham said now this is only a
[50:17] dream he said i walked over this way i
[50:18] seen a brother roy borders a very good
[50:20] friend of mine lives in california
[50:22] he said look like there's something
[50:24] wrong his eyes was half closed and great
[50:27] big maybe cancer or something over his
[50:28] eyes
[50:29] he said and someone was trying to pull
[50:31] me away from him
[50:33] i screamed brother borders in the name
[50:35] of the lord jesus step out of that
[50:38] and he could just barely could speak
[50:40] saying brother branham
[50:42] it'll have to take something more than
[50:44] this i just can't grasp it brother
[50:46] random i just can't grasp it
[50:48] and i said over the borders he said i
[50:51] love him
[50:52] and someone pulled me away and i looked
[50:54] and was a lady standing over there that
[50:55] when i was a little boy
[50:57] i used to haul groceries from the
[50:58] grocery store to the people and her name
[51:00] was mrs finton
[51:01] she lives in jeffersonville you had a
[51:02] personal friend of the wife and i
[51:04] she said brother branham deliver us from
[51:06] this
[51:08] and said this is a house of hell and
[51:10] said you've been misunderstood and you
[51:12] misunderstood these people too
[51:15] said these are fine people said well i
[51:17] looked over there like a great big
[51:19] cellar big walls down beneath a great
[51:20] big cave great iron bars eight or ten
[51:23] inches thick
[51:24] people out of their mind isn't that the
[51:27] condition people are in today
[51:29] people out of their mind twisted arms
[51:31] and legs beating their head like that
[51:33] and she was crying saying deliver the
[51:34] people brother branham
[51:36] said help us we're in trouble she
[51:38] herself i know her she belongs to i
[51:40] believe he said the
[51:41] christian church called church of the
[51:43] brethren he said i looked around i said
[51:45] i wish i could
[51:47] go on looking around my little bitty
[51:49] body and them great big iron bars
[51:52] those poor people in there you couldn't
[51:54] get to them them iron bars
[51:56] was sitting close together now look they
[51:58] were beating their head like they were
[52:00] out of their mind
[52:01] and i've seen some lights flickering
[52:03] around in there
[52:05] oh my and i looked up and there stood
[52:07] the lord jesus with the lights of a
[52:09] rainbow around him
[52:10] he was looking right straight to me and
[52:12] said deliver those people
[52:14] and he went away and i thought well how
[52:16] could i deliver them
[52:18] i haven't got strength enough in my arms
[52:20] to break those bars
[52:22] so i said oh i love this
[52:25] house of hell give way to the name of
[52:27] jesus christ
[52:29] now you've heard this preached on before
[52:31] and maybe used it heard it many times
[52:33] but i want you to take notice of what's
[52:34] going on here was these people in
[52:36] bondage and a prophet of god
[52:38] cried out house of hell give way
[52:41] now brother man i'm saying all the
[52:43] creaking and popping and rocks rolling
[52:45] and bars falling and people running
[52:47] screaming delivered
[52:48] screaming at the top of their voice and
[52:50] was all delivered
[52:52] he said i was screaming then brother
[52:54] borders where are you
[52:57] now the point i want to get to is here
[52:59] is a prophet of god
[53:00] who cried house of hell give way to the
[53:03] name of jesus christ
[53:04] we've heard that cry in our day we have
[53:08] heard that cry
[53:11] a message has come forth the midnight
[53:13] cry and he cried house of hell give way
[53:17] and all the creaking and the popping and
[53:18] the rocks rolling and bars falling who
[53:20] was that that was
[53:21] us
[53:24] but notice immediately brother branham
[53:26] begins to look
[53:28] for brother borders because he knew
[53:30] brother borders was in that condition
[53:32] too
[53:33] and he loved the border so he began to
[53:34] look for an individual
[53:36] and he was screaming then brother roy
[53:38] borders where are you where are you
[53:40] god is delivering his people where are
[53:42] you brother borders
[53:44] he said i've wondered about that
[53:49] could i tell you today from my heart i
[53:52] believe without a doubt that the message
[53:54] has uttered forth in this age house of
[53:57] hell
[53:58] give way
[54:02] but where are you brother borders i
[54:04] don't know by the borders or what
[54:05] happened with him but i know this
[54:07] i would say this to those who are back
[54:09] said where are you
[54:12] i'll say this to those who just can't
[54:13] seem to have enough faith to live for
[54:14] god
[54:15] where are you so that's the revival of
[54:19] our day it's
[54:20] it's not that the house of hell is not
[54:22] broken
[54:23] loose it's not that there's no
[54:24] deliverance there is deliverance
[54:27] there is deliverance we've heard the
[54:28] message we've heard that voice we
[54:30] we we know that the voice of god in this
[54:32] day not the voice of a man but the voice
[54:34] of god
[54:35] uh it was a voice behind the voice we
[54:38] could say it that way not that not the
[54:40] literal voice of brother brown but the
[54:41] voice of god spoke
[54:42] said house of hell break loose but where
[54:44] are we at today
[54:45] where are you word of life tabernacle
[54:50] where are you do you have the ability to
[54:52] take god at his word
[54:53] and begin to run out and scream i'm
[54:55] delivered
[54:58] do we have the ability to stand there
[54:59] and say i'm delivered
[55:01] can you take god at his word and say i'm
[55:03] going to live the word i'm going to do
[55:05] what's right i'm going to stand for god
[55:07] i believe that i'm saved i believe that
[55:09] i'm delivered i believe
[55:10] that this message was effective to my
[55:12] family i believe this message is
[55:14] effective to my church
[55:15] i believe it's effective to my community
[55:17] i believe it'll make me a better
[55:19] christian i believe
[55:20] it'll put me in revival house of hell
[55:23] break loose we've heard that
[55:25] we're not waiting on somebody to come
[55:26] along and scream it we've heard it but
[55:28] now where are you
[55:32] let me brothers that can preach ought to
[55:33] take that sometime where are you
[55:37] where are you brother borders where are
[55:40] you at this morning maybe you're
[55:42] listening this morning and
[55:43] and it's just hard to even get the faith
[55:45] to to come to the house of god where are
[55:47] you
[55:48] are you participating in the bride's
[55:50] revival every one of us ought to
[55:52] ought to examine ourselves like samson
[55:54] did as he stood there that day
[55:55] where are you the promise has already
[55:58] been made the
[56:00] the blessings are there the promises are
[56:02] there i don't have to create them
[56:03] i don't have to make it happen i don't
[56:05] have to make it up but where are you
[56:07] this morning
[56:09] oh if we could just recognize the power
[56:11] of god
[56:12] that there's there's a possibility that
[56:15] you can be delivered that you could be
[56:17] free
[56:20] where are you backsider where are you
[56:23] who lives in a way that you know is
[56:25] wrong
[56:26] the power is here to release you the
[56:29] word has already been spoken you know
[56:31] better
[56:32] but there's power here to release you
[56:34] from that bondage
[56:37] as i said brother branham saw the
[56:39] preview of the bride and he talked about
[56:41] how that she'd come by and he said
[56:43] he said that talk speaking of that last
[56:44] breath he said i have to watch her
[56:46] she'll get out of step with that word
[56:47] and
[56:48] if i don't watch and i'm just
[56:49] paraphrasing he said when she's passing
[56:50] by
[56:51] if she gets by he says maybe it'll be my
[56:54] time after i'm finished
[56:56] and he said that he said these girls
[56:59] were walking through there and they were
[57:00] trying their best and was getting back
[57:01] to get in line
[57:03] because they was looking out somewhere
[57:04] else he said they were looking out
[57:07] somewhere else watching about that
[57:08] church that just went out into chaos
[57:11] so here is a group of of the bride
[57:14] who needed to participate and in order
[57:17] to do that they had to stay in tune with
[57:19] the word
[57:21] stay in step with the word so we find a
[57:24] voice
[57:24] calling out to them saying get back in
[57:26] line
[57:28] so out here we have a voice crying out
[57:30] house of hell let loose and here
[57:32] come all of the uh all of the ones that
[57:35] needed to be delivered
[57:36] were delivered but here's a prophet
[57:39] crying out get back in line
[57:41] because they begin to get their eyesight
[57:43] on other things
[57:45] instead of on the word of god instead of
[57:48] on the message of the hour they begin to
[57:49] look at politics so they begin to look
[57:51] at
[57:52] at the world they begin to look at the
[57:53] condition of the age they begin to look
[57:54] at their own condition
[57:55] instead of looking at the promise
[57:59] instead of looking at the possibility of
[58:01] what god could do
[58:03] you don't have to live under
[58:04] condemnation why place yourself back
[58:07] under that bondage don't walk you back
[58:08] inside that prison
[58:10] don't walk buddy you've been let loose
[58:12] the door's open the bars have fallen
[58:15] don't walk back in there on your own
[58:16] accord
[58:19] don't get out of step and that's what we
[58:21] do so many times by the day as we begin
[58:22] to look we see that church out there
[58:24] going down into hell and we begin to
[58:26] we just get out of step because we're
[58:28] watching what they're doing
[58:29] instead of watching what the word is
[58:31] doing how many times have i seen pastors
[58:33] get out of step
[58:34] because they're watching what some other
[58:36] church is doing instead of what they're
[58:37] supposed to be doing right here
[58:39] god help me to watch and see lord what
[58:41] would you have for us
[58:43] you're watching what that other church
[58:45] is doing yes they're doing wrong they're
[58:46] going down into hell
[58:47] but let's let's keep in line ourselves
[58:51] let's hear the voice of a prophet crying
[58:52] get back in line
[58:58] now he said it looked like they were
[59:01] trying to get back in line doesn't that
[59:02] give you hope
[59:05] but they had to participate in it samson
[59:08] had to participate in the revival
[59:10] his hair had already grown back but
[59:13] there were conditions that had to be men
[59:15] for him to be in revival the first thing
[59:18] he had to have faith in the promise of
[59:20] the
[59:20] hour most people
[59:25] that have a problem with not being able
[59:27] to live the gospel in our day
[59:29] because of a lack of faith it's also the
[59:33] key to most false doctrine
[59:35] because the promise is too simple
[59:39] it's hard to believe so you get off on
[59:42] something else that's easier to explain
[59:46] right and so people come up with man's
[59:49] ideas because of that and
[59:50] they can't live right because well
[59:52] that's good i believe god's a healer but
[59:54] not for me i
[59:55] i believe god can keep you from all
[59:57] these things but but me i've got a
[59:58] condition
[59:59] i'm different but see
[1:00:02] that's that's not what god does that's
[1:00:05] not what god says he says coming to me
[1:00:07] that are weary and heavy laden i will
[1:00:10] give you rest
[1:00:12] take my yoke on me my yoke is easy my my
[1:00:15] burden is light
[1:00:17] he cries i can i can share you i can be
[1:00:20] that burden bearer that helen talked
[1:00:21] about
[1:00:22] a couple weeks ago i i'll be that for
[1:00:24] you and he's crying out to us to do that
[1:00:27] and to be that
[1:00:29] now but before samson could be revived
[1:00:33] and we talked about this a little bit
[1:00:34] last week but i want to go in depth this
[1:00:36] morning
[1:00:37] before he could be revived he had to
[1:00:40] recognize the possibility of revival
[1:00:45] see he couldn't preach a negative gospel
[1:00:49] that well there's no possibility whether
[1:00:51] if there's no possibility
[1:00:52] god failed if there's
[1:00:56] no possibility of you having rapturing
[1:00:57] faith god failed
[1:01:00] when the rapture comes there's got to be
[1:01:01] somebody who has rapturing faith
[1:01:04] and it may not be a lot of people but
[1:01:06] there's going to be somebody
[1:01:08] right and god don't fail we know that
[1:01:11] but if there's no possibility then god
[1:01:13] failed
[1:01:14] you see the promise was still there
[1:01:16] samson stood there he'd been defeated
[1:01:18] he'd been stripped down
[1:01:19] by a woman he'd been he'd done
[1:01:21] everything wrong but he was standing
[1:01:23] there there's a possibility
[1:01:26] and you've got to recognize and grab
[1:01:28] hold of that possibility no matter what
[1:01:30] you've done and where you've been and
[1:01:31] what's happened in your life what's
[1:01:33] happened to a church
[1:01:34] what's happened to the message of the
[1:01:35] whole you look at that and say well
[1:01:36] there's a possibility
[1:01:38] because the promise is still the same
[1:01:41] i can participate in this revival now
[1:01:45] brother brown said it this way and oh
[1:01:47] lord just once more he said
[1:01:48] what time is it that's an interesting
[1:01:52] way to put it
[1:01:53] samson is standing there saying what
[1:01:55] time is it
[1:01:57] his hair's back huh but the word has
[1:02:00] been restored
[1:02:02] so now it's time for him to begin to
[1:02:05] defeat his enemy
[1:02:07] what time is it is there a possibility
[1:02:10] samson stood there and said what time
[1:02:13] see you've got to recognize the day that
[1:02:15] you're living in
[1:02:16] and that's why it's so dangerous to to
[1:02:18] put it off on another time you say well
[1:02:20] something will happen after the rapture
[1:02:22] right before the rapture and then we'll
[1:02:23] all be caught up no what time is it
[1:02:26] what time it is is there a possibility
[1:02:29] and he said what time just is there a
[1:02:31] possibility sampson happened to think
[1:02:33] that great god
[1:02:34] he's omnipresent he's an everlasting god
[1:02:37] i see my mistake i'm going to repent
[1:02:40] and he cried out
[1:02:44] he said there is a possibility that we
[1:02:46] could do the same thing
[1:02:49] day of that day he said if this they
[1:02:51] don't see the vision
[1:02:53] like samson if we could only see the
[1:02:55] vision of a possibility
[1:02:58] he said start right here right now
[1:03:02] a possibility see how could moses go
[1:03:06] down to egypt with a
[1:03:07] with a mule his wife on a mule with a
[1:03:10] baby on her hip
[1:03:11] he had a vision of a possibility
[1:03:15] people look and say the people are in
[1:03:16] bondage and people are never going to
[1:03:17] their bunch of
[1:03:18] hard heads anyway they'll never listen
[1:03:22] and they hardly ever did but there was a
[1:03:23] possibility
[1:03:25] he believed he saw the vision of a
[1:03:27] possibility revealed to him by a pillar
[1:03:28] of fire and so he went up there to take
[1:03:30] over take over egypt and the people
[1:03:32] thought he was foolish but there was a
[1:03:33] possibility
[1:03:35] people think you're foolish when you
[1:03:36] begin to really really get down to
[1:03:38] business with god but listen there's a
[1:03:40] possibility
[1:03:42] you're living in the day of possibility
[1:03:44] now samson's
[1:03:45] vision of possibility was rooted in the
[1:03:47] word that the angel brought
[1:03:50] when he was a boy that his mother taught
[1:03:52] him what the angel said
[1:03:54] you're no ordinary boy and faith cometh
[1:03:56] by hearing brother says as long as god
[1:03:58] sees those seven locks
[1:04:00] he sees his promise he said samson could
[1:04:02] reach back there and feel that
[1:04:04] and as long as god sees those seven
[1:04:06] locks he sees his promise hallelujah
[1:04:08] he said they shaved them off one time
[1:04:10] but they growed back
[1:04:12] when old samson stood there and seen
[1:04:13] them seven logs he knew
[1:04:15] god could look down and see his promise
[1:04:17] he was under obligation to his word
[1:04:19] do you see when people don't see when
[1:04:21] people say well it's never going to
[1:04:22] happen
[1:04:22] there's never going to be a church on
[1:04:24] fire there again there's never going to
[1:04:25] be a place i see
[1:04:26] a vision of a possibility there's the
[1:04:29] promise is still the same
[1:04:30] and you're believers so if you're
[1:04:32] believers and the promise is still there
[1:04:34] there's a possibility that god will keep
[1:04:36] his word
[1:04:38] hallelujah he said when old samson stood
[1:04:42] there and seen him seven logs he knew
[1:04:44] god could look down and see his promise
[1:04:45] he was under obligation to his word he
[1:04:48] said i say tonight that every man and
[1:04:50] woman here
[1:04:51] that'll take jesus christ sister healer
[1:04:53] trader as their savior
[1:04:54] and accept the word of god when god sees
[1:04:56] his promise he will keep it
[1:04:59] hallelujah those of you watching today
[1:05:02] at home remember that he will keep his
[1:05:03] word
[1:05:05] hallelujah he said and i don't care how
[1:05:07] much the devils beat you down with
[1:05:08] sickness
[1:05:09] or you hear it in church i don't care
[1:05:11] how much the devil's beat you down with
[1:05:13] sickness with leukemia
[1:05:14] with cancer with tuberculosis or
[1:05:16] crippled or whatever he's done you just
[1:05:18] take that promise of god
[1:05:20] the word of god and say i believe it
[1:05:22] hallelujah faith cometh by hearing
[1:05:24] hearing the word of god he said for god
[1:05:27] looks down
[1:05:28] and sees that promise applied by the
[1:05:30] blood of jesus christ
[1:05:31] something's going to happen samson was
[1:05:34] down there grinding he was blind
[1:05:36] and he reached up he couldn't feel it
[1:05:37] yet he said someday it'll be there
[1:05:40] and one day he reached up and said there
[1:05:42] it is
[1:05:44] hallelujah amen first he had to say
[1:05:47] he'll be there to be there
[1:05:49] when they reach up there it is that's
[1:05:52] the age we're living in we're living in
[1:05:53] that time
[1:05:54] what time is it the locks are there
[1:05:56] we're standing there the devil may look
[1:05:58] like he'd won
[1:05:59] but we're standing there at that time
[1:06:02] with a possibility of participating in
[1:06:04] this bride's revival
[1:06:08] hallelujah amen he said he reached up he
[1:06:11] couldn't fill yet someday it'll be there
[1:06:13] yes sir
[1:06:13] when they reached up and said there it
[1:06:15] is there it is god will see my seven
[1:06:17] locks again yes sir when god sees my
[1:06:20] seven locks
[1:06:21] he will see his promise to me amen what
[1:06:24] has happened in our day when god sees a
[1:06:26] fall
[1:06:26] restoration of the word when he sees a
[1:06:28] church that
[1:06:29] his hearts have been turned back to the
[1:06:31] promise of the pentecostal fathers when
[1:06:33] he sees that that's
[1:06:34] our day elijah came and did that
[1:06:38] are you with me now elijah came and did
[1:06:41] that then if he did that
[1:06:42] then when god sees my seven locks again
[1:06:44] he will see his promise of me
[1:06:47] when god sees you except his word and
[1:06:50] he's bringing it down individually
[1:06:52] when god sees you accept his word
[1:06:56] one thing for the pastor to accept it
[1:06:58] for a deacon to accept it but you
[1:07:00] when god sees you accept his word you
[1:07:03] watching this morning you
[1:07:05] sitting here in the pew when god sees
[1:07:06] you accept his word
[1:07:08] brother jt that you means me and it
[1:07:11] means you
[1:07:12] when god sees you accept his word
[1:07:14] unadulterated
[1:07:17] that's what it is see i can't live the
[1:07:20] word
[1:07:21] i have to have his help but i have to
[1:07:23] accept the word
[1:07:25] mary couldn't make a baby she couldn't
[1:07:27] produce a baby are you with me
[1:07:29] she'd never been with a man she couldn't
[1:07:30] produce a baby but the virgin mary
[1:07:33] was found with child of the holy ghost
[1:07:34] why without sensation without the
[1:07:36] handling of a man
[1:07:39] why did she do that because she said
[1:07:40] it's your word lord
[1:07:42] i accept the word of god i accept it
[1:07:44] unadulterated from my condition
[1:07:46] no matter what condition i find myself
[1:07:48] in that's the word
[1:07:49] i recognize it's true and because it's
[1:07:52] true you will keep your promise lord
[1:07:56] i don't have to rely on some story of a
[1:07:58] story of a story that i heard somewhere
[1:07:59] well maybe this is right maybe that's
[1:08:01] right no i know
[1:08:02] god keeps his word and no matter what
[1:08:04] condition i come in if i'll come back
[1:08:06] according to the word
[1:08:08] he will receive that
[1:08:11] it's your word lord then god will see
[1:08:14] his promise when he said whatsoever
[1:08:15] things you desire
[1:08:16] when you pray believe you receive it you
[1:08:18] shall have it it'll be granted to you
[1:08:20] he said brother god will keep his word
[1:08:23] do we believe that today
[1:08:25] our vision must be rooted in the word
[1:08:28] joel 2 25 and i will restore to you the
[1:08:30] years
[1:08:31] that the locusts have eaten the cake
[1:08:32] worm and the caterpillar and the palmer
[1:08:34] where my great army which i sent among
[1:08:36] you
[1:08:36] you shall eat in plenty and be satisfied
[1:08:39] and praise the name of the lord your god
[1:08:41] that has dealt wondrously with you my
[1:08:42] people shall never be ashamed
[1:08:44] listen joel 2 25 has come to pass
[1:08:48] what about joe 26 you'll eat him plenty
[1:08:51] and be satisfied
[1:08:53] that's where you're living amen we can
[1:08:56] be in a restored condition
[1:08:58] as i've said before we don't have to
[1:08:59] repeat the sins of our fathers i mean
[1:09:01] any anyone that has come before us we
[1:09:04] don't have to repeat the sins
[1:09:06] of those that have come on i might by
[1:09:07] dna i'm a certain thing but i don't have
[1:09:09] to be that
[1:09:11] i can be different why because house of
[1:09:13] hell has been let loose
[1:09:15] those bonds those those bondages that
[1:09:17] i've had on my life
[1:09:19] those things in my dna and my nature
[1:09:21] that have corrupted me that have kept me
[1:09:22] down
[1:09:23] can be released by what by the word of
[1:09:26] god
[1:09:29] i hope you hear me this morning see was
[1:09:31] the word of god that spoke in the
[1:09:33] beginning said let there be light
[1:09:36] brother bill when that word spoke what
[1:09:38] happened it came to pass
[1:09:41] he spoke and all of a sudden it began to
[1:09:43] grow it began to come up
[1:09:46] what was it let there be light and there
[1:09:47] it was so it's light
[1:09:49] and when that same word speaks to my
[1:09:51] life there may be chaos but out of that
[1:09:52] chaos he begins to create order
[1:09:55] out of those very things that would have
[1:09:56] brought weaknesses whatever things in my
[1:09:58] life that weren't right
[1:09:59] god can actually make those strengths in
[1:10:01] my life he can create order
[1:10:04] out of the disordered dna that's in my
[1:10:05] life out of the disordered thoughts in
[1:10:07] my head are you with me now
[1:10:09] god can create order and you'll find
[1:10:10] yourself eating and planting and being
[1:10:12] satisfied why
[1:10:13] the restoration has come the word has
[1:10:15] come
[1:10:18] amen but you say well look at the
[1:10:20] condition of this age
[1:10:22] you're looking at the symptoms not at
[1:10:25] the promise
[1:10:28] yes the age is terrible i agree with you
[1:10:32] that it's awful out there but we don't
[1:10:35] have to be
[1:10:39] i know the word hurts sometimes
[1:10:42] sometimes it hurts me
[1:10:44] but it's that word that brings life we
[1:10:47] don't have that word we don't have
[1:10:48] anything
[1:10:49] i'd love to be able to just just go
[1:10:51] along with whatever anybody says but the
[1:10:53] word is it that's all we can go by
[1:10:55] we're bound to that because that's where
[1:10:56] deliverance is
[1:10:58] it's in the word and so we don't have to
[1:11:01] repeat those sins because the house of
[1:11:03] hell has been torn down
[1:11:04] deliverance is here listen jeremiah 17
[1:11:08] and 5 this is the promise of the word
[1:11:10] he said thus saith the lord cursed be
[1:11:11] the man that trusteth in man
[1:11:13] make his flesh his arm whose heart
[1:11:15] departeth from the lord
[1:11:16] you say well if i could be in brother
[1:11:18] so-and-so's church or i could if i could
[1:11:19] have been here maybe even when the
[1:11:20] prophet was here if i could have done
[1:11:22] those things
[1:11:22] you trust in a man and he said cursed be
[1:11:25] the man
[1:11:26] that trusteth in man make his flesh his
[1:11:28] arm whose heart departeth from the lord
[1:11:30] for he shall be like the heath that's a
[1:11:31] tumbleweed in the desert he shall be
[1:11:33] like the heath in the desert shall not
[1:11:35] see where good cometh but shall inhabit
[1:11:36] the parts places in the wilderness in
[1:11:38] the salt land
[1:11:39] and not inhabited but verse 7 blessed is
[1:11:41] the man
[1:11:42] that trusteth in the lord whose hope the
[1:11:45] lord is
[1:11:46] what is he his word he is the word
[1:11:50] blessed is the man that trusteth in the
[1:11:52] lord whose hope the lord is for he shall
[1:11:53] be as a tree
[1:11:54] planted by the waters and then spreadeth
[1:11:56] out her roots by the river
[1:11:58] and you say well there's there's trouble
[1:12:00] coming there's trouble there's communism
[1:12:02] coming there's
[1:12:03] there's a catholic church rising up
[1:12:04] there's different things happening but
[1:12:05] listen what he says he shall not see
[1:12:07] when he
[1:12:08] cometh but her leaf shall be green
[1:12:11] and shall not be careful in the year of
[1:12:12] drought what does that mean it means it
[1:12:14] won't take in any less water in the
[1:12:16] drought than it did in the
[1:12:17] in the good times it won't be any less
[1:12:20] revive
[1:12:21] in revival than it was in the drought
[1:12:22] why or in the good times why
[1:12:24] because it will not be careful in the
[1:12:26] year of drought neither shall cease from
[1:12:27] yielding fruit
[1:12:28] why it's a tree planted by the waters
[1:12:31] hallelujah as a continual source of life
[1:12:36] brother branham in recognizing your day
[1:12:37] in this message he said the bride
[1:12:40] will come and to preach you again here
[1:12:42] he talks about he said here the bride
[1:12:44] come behind her
[1:12:45] the very same looking bride that passed
[1:12:47] at the beginning
[1:12:48] can we see that possibility today the
[1:12:51] very same looking bride that passed at
[1:12:53] the beginning
[1:12:53] he said then my heart jumped for joy to
[1:12:56] know that there will be a bride
[1:12:59] and she will be made of the same thing
[1:13:01] and clothed in the same thing that the
[1:13:03] one was at the beginning
[1:13:05] he said she is to be called he said and
[1:13:08] i know that is the truth listen to this
[1:13:09] striking statement
[1:13:10] he said if that isn't true then every
[1:13:12] vision that i've had in the back has
[1:13:14] been wrong
[1:13:15] he said and anyone knows that not one
[1:13:17] thing has ever told us but what was the
[1:13:19] truth
[1:13:21] pretty bad why so many times he traveled
[1:13:23] the country and he would speak maybe to
[1:13:25] 10 or 15 people to him your name is this
[1:13:27] this is what's wrong with you this is
[1:13:28] where you come from
[1:13:29] sometimes tell them 10 12 15 different
[1:13:31] things about their own lives
[1:13:33] he's showing us he god keeps his word
[1:13:36] his word is true he was here
[1:13:37] he showed himself as the son of man in
[1:13:39] our day what was it
[1:13:41] what was it it was god proving to us
[1:13:44] that he keeps his word
[1:13:46] are you with me now and he said if this
[1:13:49] is wrong then every one of those things
[1:13:50] would have to be wrong
[1:13:53] if there's no bride listen to me if you
[1:13:56] become a
[1:13:57] defeatist and again whether it's a
[1:14:00] pastor or a preacher
[1:14:01] or myself or anybody else because i get
[1:14:04] down sometimes
[1:14:06] sometimes you stand up here you know you
[1:14:07] feel like fighting
[1:14:09] you know and sometimes you get like paul
[1:14:10] he said i fought beasts at ephesus
[1:14:13] fought the wild beast you know and
[1:14:16] sometimes you get to the place where you
[1:14:18] feel you're wore out from the battle
[1:14:19] you get up here under the anointing you
[1:14:21] can face anything say anything
[1:14:24] that's why brother brown said don't come
[1:14:26] to the platform with hidden something
[1:14:28] hidden in your heart hidden sin he said
[1:14:29] because god will speak it
[1:14:31] god will reveal it and sometimes even in
[1:14:33] the house of god i don't even know
[1:14:34] what's going on
[1:14:36] and it could be any other ministry
[1:14:37] you've seen it over the years god will
[1:14:39] speak
[1:14:40] not because we have the gift of brother
[1:14:41] branham but because the word is the
[1:14:42] discerner
[1:14:43] of the thoughts and intents of the heart
[1:14:45] god speaks and we don't go back and
[1:14:47] redo that discernment because to do that
[1:14:49] would be wrong
[1:14:51] for me to even approximate that in a
[1:14:53] public show would be wrong it'd make me
[1:14:56] a janice and jamers
[1:14:58] but the word itself is sharper than a
[1:15:00] two-edged sword
[1:15:03] and so if the word is here today it's
[1:15:06] able to come and speak
[1:15:08] directly to our lives and able to tell
[1:15:11] us exactly what's going on
[1:15:14] how we ought to come to the house of god
[1:15:15] and say lord i'm an open book
[1:15:18] whatever you want to speak lord i'm not
[1:15:20] hiding anything
[1:15:22] see but that if they hit something in
[1:15:24] their heart he would see it but he said
[1:15:25] if this is wrong
[1:15:26] then that's wrong now
[1:15:29] he said she is to be called he said i
[1:15:32] know that is the truth
[1:15:34] if that isn't true then every vision
[1:15:35] i've had in the back has been wrong and
[1:15:37] anyone knows
[1:15:38] that one thing he ever told us was the
[1:15:39] truth that come to pass
[1:15:41] and here it is the rising of the sun he
[1:15:43] said there has been churches churches
[1:15:45] brides brides churches brides brides but
[1:15:47] there's got to come one
[1:15:50] hallelujah there's got to it has to come
[1:15:52] a real bride there must come one that's
[1:15:54] not only got the mechanics
[1:15:56] but the dynamics of it makes that church
[1:15:58] live move in the power of his
[1:15:59] resurrection
[1:16:01] there's got to come one what did samson
[1:16:03] realize i'm the man
[1:16:06] i'm the one so no matter
[1:16:09] what i failed to do in the past i know
[1:16:11] i'm the one
[1:16:13] that's called to do this and so i'm
[1:16:14] going to do it i'm going to do and that
[1:16:16] applies to every one of our lives now
[1:16:23] he had to recognize so samson had to
[1:16:25] believe in the possibility and the
[1:16:26] second thing is he had to recognize
[1:16:28] his current state he couldn't lie about
[1:16:31] it
[1:16:32] he couldn't stand up there and say i'm
[1:16:33] not blind
[1:16:35] i'm not bound he had to realize he was
[1:16:38] bound he would realize he was blind
[1:16:40] being led around by a little boy
[1:16:42] he had to realize that when they made
[1:16:44] fun of him that they had good points
[1:16:49] they did he couldn't defend himself
[1:16:54] they're right they're right
[1:16:57] but they're not right about god
[1:17:00] whatever you say about me you know you
[1:17:03] could say oh
[1:17:03] you're just a horrible low down kind of
[1:17:07] person that's probably true without the
[1:17:08] grace of god
[1:17:10] whatever you say about me might be true
[1:17:12] but not what you say about him
[1:17:16] and samson said i was called i was
[1:17:19] elected before i was born
[1:17:21] to defeat this this enemy the
[1:17:23] philistines
[1:17:25] and if i was elected to do it then
[1:17:28] there's a possibility
[1:17:30] amen if i could recognize what i'm doing
[1:17:33] where i'm at
[1:17:34] then i could be restored look
[1:17:38] he said notice he thought of all his
[1:17:40] victories and then this must have been
[1:17:41] through his mind
[1:17:42] how that he had failed god's people
[1:17:45] now i don't want you to take this wrong
[1:17:48] because
[1:17:50] my heart is open to you i'm not living
[1:17:52] in sin but how many times do i walk in
[1:17:54] the
[1:17:55] church in the pulpit and say i failed
[1:17:57] god's people
[1:17:59] how many times i walk i can't tell how
[1:18:00] many times i walk back there and say i
[1:18:01] failed god's people
[1:18:04] you just feel helpless sometimes
[1:18:07] he and he said samson felt that way
[1:18:10] and samson had failed but brother
[1:18:13] branham
[1:18:14] very specifically tells us how he failed
[1:18:16] he said now notice he thought he of all
[1:18:18] his victories and then his mind must
[1:18:19] went through his mind
[1:18:20] how they'd fail god's people go that
[1:18:22] next quote
[1:18:23] he said it ought to be a shame to a
[1:18:25] minister that will sit and read this
[1:18:27] bible then walk out before his people
[1:18:29] he said the world is full of lots now
[1:18:32] many times when i think
[1:18:33] that i failed god's peoples because i
[1:18:35] think well maybe i've been too hard
[1:18:37] i've been too hard but that's what
[1:18:38] brother branham says he says the world
[1:18:40] is full of lots the bible said the sins
[1:18:42] of sodom vexed his righteous soul
[1:18:44] but he didn't have the courage to stand
[1:18:45] up and rebuke that sin
[1:18:49] and he said there's many men today and i
[1:18:51] say this with reverence only with love
[1:18:52] but just to say truth he said we may
[1:18:54] never meet again
[1:18:55] the next side said there's many men that
[1:18:57] reads this same bible that we read
[1:18:59] sits in his office preparing his message
[1:19:01] and run upon these truths of god
[1:19:03] and have to bypass them he said he would
[1:19:06] be afraid to preach against the women
[1:19:08] cutting their hair his organization
[1:19:09] would turn him out
[1:19:10] about them wearing immoral clothes and
[1:19:11] committing spiritual adultery
[1:19:14] he said about the men that takes a
[1:19:15] sociable drink on christmas and gets out
[1:19:17] and has a little clean american fun
[1:19:18] tells dirty jokes still maintains his
[1:19:20] office as a deacon they know them things
[1:19:22] are wrong
[1:19:23] he said but there as it was in the days
[1:19:24] of lot we're back to that sinful place
[1:19:27] again
[1:19:28] i'm not talking about these deacons here
[1:19:29] it's just a quote but you understand
[1:19:32] that
[1:19:32] look he said we're back to that sinful
[1:19:34] place again where a man's afraid to say
[1:19:36] anything
[1:19:38] oh god god help us today
[1:19:42] we're afraid some people are afraid even
[1:19:44] in their own homes to stand up and say
[1:19:45] something
[1:19:47] if it's wrong and over the years i think
[1:19:50] we've become
[1:19:50] because there's so much legalism that's
[1:19:52] going on and people worry about the
[1:19:54] length of your sleeves and
[1:19:56] and measuring how far you dress this
[1:19:57] from the floor and things like that and
[1:19:59] you begin to
[1:20:00] it's just legalism it's just a man's
[1:20:03] idea
[1:20:04] it's all it is if it's not in the word
[1:20:05] but at times you kind of get to the
[1:20:07] point where you just don't say anything
[1:20:08] about anything
[1:20:09] and people can do things that's just
[1:20:10] wrong and everybody knows it's wrong and
[1:20:13] everybody's afraid to say anything
[1:20:15] but look somebody's got to say something
[1:20:19] somebody got to say something and
[1:20:21] brother brandon says oh
[1:20:22] he said how samson must have been
[1:20:24] reminded by the holy spirit how he had
[1:20:26] failed god's people and it failed god
[1:20:28] himself
[1:20:30] and now he's a prisoner of the very
[1:20:32] thing
[1:20:33] that god raised him up and give him
[1:20:34] power to destroy
[1:20:36] he had to recognize he'd failed god's
[1:20:38] people by not standing for the word
[1:20:40] and the second thing he had to recognize
[1:20:42] that he was blind he said well that
[1:20:44] ought to be easy to see
[1:20:45] yes but the laodicean church didn't know
[1:20:48] they were blind
[1:20:50] they were blinded didn't know it and
[1:20:53] brother brown says that the enemy can
[1:20:54] only blind your eyes from the real thing
[1:20:56] of god
[1:20:57] you'll walk right over the top of it and
[1:20:58] not know it no matter what god does and
[1:21:01] vindicates it by his scripture and
[1:21:02] proves it by his power
[1:21:03] if your eyes are not open to the things
[1:21:05] of god you'll walk right over it as
[1:21:06] blind as you can be
[1:21:07] don't you see why satan allows even
[1:21:10] sometimes good men but satan
[1:21:12] will get and try to mess up the ministry
[1:21:14] because if he can get the ministry to a
[1:21:15] place where people have no confidence in
[1:21:17] it then what happens is every time
[1:21:18] someone comes that is right
[1:21:20] there's a scarecrow that comes up huh
[1:21:23] i know what i'm talking about from my
[1:21:25] own life
[1:21:27] from my own life from my from from
[1:21:29] growing up and i know
[1:21:30] how the devil can come to you and work
[1:21:32] on you and try to make you think
[1:21:33] nobody's right
[1:21:35] huh but what is it he's blinding your
[1:21:37] eyes to the fact that god keeps his word
[1:21:41] amen he said no matter what god does and
[1:21:43] vindicates it by scripture of it proves
[1:21:45] it by his power if your eyes are not
[1:21:46] open
[1:21:47] to the things of god you'll walk right
[1:21:49] over it as blind as you can be
[1:21:52] and he said again and once more he said
[1:21:54] now jezebel knew or not jezebel but
[1:21:56] delilah knew
[1:21:57] if she could ever punch his eyes out
[1:21:59] that was it he said and that's exactly
[1:22:01] what delilah of this last day is done to
[1:22:03] the church punched his eyes out to god's
[1:22:05] promise
[1:22:06] and sold you some great big intellectual
[1:22:08] denomination
[1:22:09] everybody likes to say i belong to the
[1:22:12] first church
[1:22:13] i belong down there see as long as the
[1:22:16] devil can put your eyes out to the word
[1:22:18] of god and the promise of god
[1:22:20] no matter how foolish it sounds it's
[1:22:22] god's promise
[1:22:24] so instead of having your confidence
[1:22:26] being in your own walk with god
[1:22:28] and in the al your own the the clarity
[1:22:30] and the communion that you have with god
[1:22:32] your confidence comes from what church
[1:22:34] you belong to what group you're a part
[1:22:36] of
[1:22:36] who you listen to on sunday what is
[1:22:39] satan blind in your eyes
[1:22:41] as long as the devil can put your eyes
[1:22:42] out to the word of god in the promise of
[1:22:44] god no matter how foolish it comes
[1:22:46] or it sounds it's god's promise
[1:22:49] so what did samson cry lord avenge my
[1:22:52] eyes
[1:22:56] the third thing the condition he had to
[1:23:00] have the faith to believe it was a
[1:23:01] possibility he had to recognize
[1:23:03] his condition and he had to allow death
[1:23:05] to come to himself
[1:23:08] he had to be willing to die samson said
[1:23:11] let me die
[1:23:13] with the philistines but branham deals
[1:23:16] with that extensively in these sermons
[1:23:17] just one more time lord just once more
[1:23:19] lord he preaches this
[1:23:20] several times he said they're not
[1:23:23] willing to pay the price
[1:23:25] samson prayed right what did he pray he
[1:23:28] said in closing i might say this lord
[1:23:31] let me die with the enemy that's the
[1:23:34] trouble they don't want to pay the price
[1:23:35] of dying
[1:23:36] you've got your own self worked up into
[1:23:38] a community
[1:23:40] into a bunch of people that you
[1:23:41] associate with and play cards
[1:23:43] stay home and watch programs eat tater
[1:23:45] chips and drink cokes
[1:23:47] if you ever saw 20 20.
[1:23:54] sit at home and excuse me if you're
[1:23:56] eating tater chips out there this
[1:23:57] morning
[1:23:59] i can't see through there it's not
[1:24:00] two-way screen
[1:24:04] they sit at home and watch programs and
[1:24:06] eat tater chips at least you're watching
[1:24:07] church
[1:24:08] amen we said the church sits empty
[1:24:13] make you sign a card you'll come six
[1:24:16] months out of the year to sunday school
[1:24:18] he said such a man made enthusiasm what
[1:24:21] you need is the holy ghost
[1:24:23] or you say i got it he said you sure
[1:24:25] don't act like it
[1:24:27] he said let the preacher preach an hour
[1:24:29] or something another like that
[1:24:30] are you ready to call the trustee board
[1:24:32] and throw him out about ready to throw
[1:24:34] myself out when i preach over an hour
[1:24:38] he said that's right it's the truth not
[1:24:40] willing he said
[1:24:42] oh he said you want to eat your cake and
[1:24:43] keep it too he said you can't do that no
[1:24:45] sir
[1:24:46] you got to surrender yourself you got a
[1:24:49] price to pay do we believe that today
[1:24:51] we got a cleaning up to do do you want
[1:24:52] to participate in this bride revival
[1:24:55] you got a cleaning up to do he said i
[1:24:56] tell you the whole world church world
[1:24:58] needs a cleaning all the way from the
[1:24:59] pulpit to the janitor's room
[1:25:02] said that's right it's the truth he said
[1:25:04] not willing to pay but simpson prayed
[1:25:06] right when he said lord
[1:25:07] let me die with these philistines he had
[1:25:10] failed but let me die
[1:25:12] he said you must be ready to die to the
[1:25:14] enemy that got this victory over you
[1:25:17] oh church see as long as you're alive
[1:25:19] the enemy can make fun of you
[1:25:21] as long as you're alive the enemy can
[1:25:23] keep you in bondage as long as you're
[1:25:25] alive as long as you're not willing to
[1:25:26] die
[1:25:27] the enemy's got you shackled but when
[1:25:29] you're willing to die
[1:25:31] you can be delivered amen
[1:25:34] amen he said you must be ready to die to
[1:25:37] the enemy it's got this victory over you
[1:25:39] you must be willing to surrender your
[1:25:41] own ideas samson was willing to pay the
[1:25:43] price
[1:25:43] to get the power of god again he said i
[1:25:46] wonder if you women are willing to let
[1:25:47] your hair grow out
[1:25:48] i wonder if you men has got enough
[1:25:50] courage to tell her that you're supposed
[1:25:51] to be the head of the house she's the
[1:25:53] next she turns you
[1:25:54] he said that's contrary you think a
[1:25:56] shaking revival would ever take these
[1:25:57] women out of these public offices
[1:25:59] policemen on the streets and things she
[1:26:00] ought to be in the kitchen
[1:26:02] and you know i know these things are
[1:26:04] tough for us to hear in 2020.
[1:26:07] i know that and look and we're looking
[1:26:09] at it was easy for him to say it then
[1:26:10] because
[1:26:11] th the world many of the worldly
[1:26:13] churches even believe this
[1:26:16] but it's hard to hear today now i looked
[1:26:18] at that and i thought i'll just take
[1:26:20] that part out
[1:26:22] and i got convicted
[1:26:25] i can't do that are you with me now
[1:26:29] it's still the word of god
[1:26:34] he said i'm not trying to control your
[1:26:36] lives i just want us to think about
[1:26:37] where we're at are we willing to die
[1:26:41] he said you think you'd ever be able to
[1:26:43] get back to that again no sir he said
[1:26:45] she'll never do it unless she gets saved
[1:26:47] and she'll do it you won't have to tell
[1:26:49] her nothing about it she'll find her
[1:26:50] place
[1:26:54] that spoke to me i said god because i it
[1:26:56] grieved my heart i thought lord
[1:26:58] i don't have to tell people that it's
[1:27:00] wrong to do certain things that are just
[1:27:01] obvious
[1:27:03] i don't mean over the pulpit i just but
[1:27:05] just sometimes things come up and it's
[1:27:06] like
[1:27:07] we know that these things are wrong you
[1:27:09] you know that the wrong people come and
[1:27:10] know that they're wrong
[1:27:12] but it's like you got to tell people
[1:27:13] that it's wrong brother brown said you
[1:27:15] won't have to tell her nothing about it
[1:27:16] she'll find her place the holy ghost
[1:27:17] will lead her to her place
[1:27:19] but say the holy ghost is leading me to
[1:27:22] that contrary to the word
[1:27:24] he said don't call that the holy ghost
[1:27:29] how many times some people come and say
[1:27:30] well brother ben i'm praying about this
[1:27:32] well you can't pray about something
[1:27:34] that's a denial of the word
[1:27:38] if you're allowed to do it it'd be like
[1:27:40] end up like balaam
[1:27:42] i'm sorry i know i'm getting repetitive
[1:27:44] i hate myself for turning into
[1:27:46] a pastor
[1:27:50] sometimes i do
[1:27:53] but you know we've got somebody's got to
[1:27:55] say it
[1:27:58] he said don't call that the holy ghost
[1:28:00] he said you fathers you mothers this
[1:28:02] spoke to me in my heart
[1:28:04] and my family are you ready to establish
[1:28:05] an altar in your house
[1:28:07] you notice how he says he said your
[1:28:08] father's your mother he said well he
[1:28:10] won't do it well
[1:28:11] who does that leave to do it somebody's
[1:28:14] got to do it
[1:28:15] are you ready to establish an altar in
[1:28:16] your house take that television out are
[1:28:18] you ready to take that deck of cards off
[1:28:19] the table
[1:28:20] i know people take that and say well if
[1:28:21] i don't have a tv i'm clear i'm clean no
[1:28:25] you got a tv on your phone don't have
[1:28:27] mine with me almost everybody does
[1:28:30] huh but are you willing to lay that down
[1:28:32] if that's what it takes for you to die
[1:28:35] well i don't have tv but you binge
[1:28:37] watched 36 episodes of your favorite
[1:28:39] show on netflix last night
[1:28:43] and you show up at church dazed and
[1:28:45] confused
[1:28:48] i said brother ben you've never done
[1:28:50] that we won't go there
[1:28:54] i've tried to do right with my family
[1:28:57] but we listen we live in this age this
[1:28:59] is the age that we live in
[1:29:01] huh are we ready to establish an altar
[1:29:03] in our house
[1:29:04] he said are you ready to take the deck
[1:29:06] of cards off the table in comic books
[1:29:07] your children's reading preparing the
[1:29:08] little minds for a blast that the
[1:29:09] devil's going to give them
[1:29:11] and again you can take these as a
[1:29:13] legalistic set of things and then
[1:29:15] everything that you think is wrong is
[1:29:16] stuck in 1963
[1:29:19] but there's things that are still wrong
[1:29:22] and some things that we shouldn't be
[1:29:23] spending
[1:29:24] our time in even today maybe that
[1:29:25] brother didn't exist in brother
[1:29:27] branham's time but it's still the truth
[1:29:31] and david said it this way a long time
[1:29:33] ago he said i'll set no evil
[1:29:34] thing before my eyes
[1:29:39] he said are you ready to establish the
[1:29:40] old family altar again or do you just
[1:29:42] want to continue on the way you are
[1:29:45] you want to continue on you're not in
[1:29:46] that condition of coming yet
[1:29:48] i can't we can't force that samson had
[1:29:50] to get in a condition where he
[1:29:51] recognized his need
[1:29:53] he said but i pray that you're like
[1:29:55] samson you see the price and you're
[1:29:56] ready lord
[1:29:58] let me die with them you knew if god
[1:30:00] answered this prayer what was going to
[1:30:02] cost
[1:30:03] he said many people i've seen him right
[1:30:04] since i've been here come up to the
[1:30:05] altar and the holy spirit come to them
[1:30:07] and they don't want to die how many
[1:30:08] times have i seen that
[1:30:10] i've been in youth meetings i've been in
[1:30:12] revival services i've been
[1:30:13] in different places they come right up
[1:30:15] to the altar and they pray and they cry
[1:30:16] but they're not willing to die see you
[1:30:19] don't come to an altar to get anything
[1:30:22] you come to an altar to give up things
[1:30:25] if you're coming for that for that
[1:30:26] purpose
[1:30:27] you say well i need salvation well if
[1:30:29] you come to the altar you're not coming
[1:30:30] to the altar because
[1:30:31] this is a place where salvation is and
[1:30:33] you'll just get it when you come up
[1:30:34] no it's your obedience to god's word and
[1:30:37] the fact that you're willing to die
[1:30:39] and for some people that requires making
[1:30:42] a fool out of themselves
[1:30:45] you ever seen god really bless you ever
[1:30:48] noticed it's the time when
[1:30:49] something you didn't want to do
[1:30:52] that's the way it works with me maybe
[1:30:53] not with everybody but when when i
[1:30:55] really don't want to do something when
[1:30:57] there's a sermon i really don't want to
[1:30:58] preach
[1:31:00] and god bless us when you feel like you
[1:31:03] well
[1:31:04] you people around you say well i really
[1:31:06] don't want to do that i i don't want to
[1:31:07] go to the altar i don't want to
[1:31:08] but listen that's the time when you make
[1:31:10] that commitment when you do
[1:31:12] that thing that god is showing you
[1:31:14] leading you to do
[1:31:15] what happens then all of a sudden you
[1:31:16] break through you break through people
[1:31:19] are willing to do a lot
[1:31:20] but are you willing to obey god are you
[1:31:22] willing to die to yourself
[1:31:25] he said they want to stay alive in the
[1:31:27] world you can't serve two gods at the
[1:31:29] same time are you ready to forsake
[1:31:30] everything to serve god
[1:31:32] listen to him cry lord only this once
[1:31:35] more
[1:31:38] there's things that you could do that
[1:31:39] would be fine but when you put it in
[1:31:42] front of god i don't care what it is
[1:31:46] are you ready to forsake that to serve
[1:31:47] god to participate in this bride's
[1:31:50] revival
[1:31:51] he said is the pentecostal church the
[1:31:53] general counsel the assemblies of god
[1:31:55] the church of god all the rest of you
[1:31:57] willing to pay the price are you willing
[1:31:59] to say once more lord
[1:32:01] here i stand i didn't have the audacity
[1:32:05] the very christian spirit to shake hands
[1:32:08] with my oneness brother or my
[1:32:09] trinitarian brother
[1:32:10] i didn't have the audacity to do it i
[1:32:12] didn't have the grace to do it when i
[1:32:14] see where it's got me to
[1:32:17] god was ever speaking to people with us
[1:32:20] today
[1:32:23] didn't have the audacity to cross the
[1:32:24] street and preachers i
[1:32:26] and you know i get if i'm not careful
[1:32:28] getting a bad attitude about it because
[1:32:30] you say
[1:32:30] you know preachers do everything they
[1:32:31] can to schedule something opposite
[1:32:33] to try to keep you from from people
[1:32:35] fellowshipping but you know what
[1:32:38] we got to be bigger than that you want
[1:32:41] fellowship i'll fellowship brother
[1:32:42] peregrine said something years ago
[1:32:44] and i didn't agree with everything barry
[1:32:46] green said but this was good he said i
[1:32:48] learned he said after being in tucson
[1:32:49] where all the people were fighting and
[1:32:50] fussing
[1:32:51] that we couldn't even agree on how to
[1:32:52] have communion he said and i learned
[1:32:54] after a while he said that utopia didn't
[1:32:56] depend on
[1:32:56] them he said it depended on me
[1:33:00] he said i could be love everybody and be
[1:33:02] at peace with everybody
[1:33:03] you know and people can only be so
[1:33:05] successful with that we're human
[1:33:08] but but that's true it only depends on
[1:33:10] us what are we willing to do
[1:33:12] do you have the audacity to have the
[1:33:13] grace to he said you see where it got me
[1:33:15] to broke up in organizations
[1:33:16] disfellowshipping with the congregation
[1:33:18] so poisoned against one another that
[1:33:19] they hardly speak to each other on the
[1:33:21] street
[1:33:22] when we're molded into one clay by the
[1:33:24] holy ghost i don't say we're that way i
[1:33:26] thank god that we're
[1:33:27] a close group we're a small group but
[1:33:29] we're close
[1:33:30] i thank god for that but don't let that
[1:33:32] poison come in among you
[1:33:34] we're molded into one clay by the holy
[1:33:36] ghost
[1:33:38] do you believe that today are you
[1:33:40] willing to have the audacity to die to
[1:33:41] yourself say lord
[1:33:43] i'm willing to fellowship with my
[1:33:44] brother
[1:33:47] he said are you willing to cry once more
[1:33:48] lord let it happen
[1:33:50] if you are god will sure hear your
[1:33:51] prayer he said watch when that man with
[1:33:54] all that fiber standing there is great
[1:33:56] regime
[1:33:57] he said but he was still blind he knew
[1:33:59] the price he knew the possibility
[1:34:02] amen and he said once more lord
[1:34:07] i know i'm reading a lot but but you
[1:34:09] just bear with me this is what the
[1:34:10] prophet said to our day
[1:34:12] you you're looking for a prophet to come
[1:34:14] back and say house of hell break loose
[1:34:16] or you're looking for
[1:34:17] some other man to come and say that he
[1:34:19] said it this is it
[1:34:22] it's the word of a prophet in our day to
[1:34:25] open up a book and show us what was
[1:34:27] there
[1:34:28] to make it live make it real in our day
[1:34:30] to show us that christ was here
[1:34:32] he said listen every fiber of his body
[1:34:34] begin to tighten up
[1:34:36] amen he said the spirit began to come on
[1:34:39] those muscles oh
[1:34:40] he said if amen if we could have the
[1:34:43] spirit that spirit

[1:35:03] that we on our sunday school to feel the
[1:35:05] fibers or the muscles of god's power
[1:35:07] tightening up
[1:35:08] where the holy spirit can come in not on
[1:35:11] a mockery but in a genuine spirit to
[1:35:13] reveal the secret of the heart
[1:35:15] to straighten up the sin that's in there
[1:35:17] cast out the evil
[1:35:18] as this fibers begin to tighten he said
[1:35:20] let me die with them
[1:35:22] i was born to destroy them let me die
[1:35:24] with them
[1:35:25] and his fibers his muscles tightened up
[1:35:28] his great huge muscles received strength

[1:35:32] and he twisted that rock with his mighty
[1:35:34] power and down she went

[1:35:57] sermon

[1:36:01] people out in the audience

[1:36:06] possibility was here
