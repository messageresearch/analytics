[49:50] for one another Second Corinthians
[49:53] 47 we have this treasure meure in Earth

[49:59] power may be of God and not of us we are
[50:03] troubled on every side yet not
[50:07] distressed we are perplexed but not in
[50:11] despair persecuted but not
[50:14] forsaken cast down but not
[50:18] destroyed always bearing about in the
[50:20] body the dying of the Lord Jesus that
[50:24] the life also of Jesus might be made
[50:27] manifest in our body amen I pray the
[50:30] Lord would add his Blessing to the word
[50:32] you may be seated immediately after the
[50:34] service today we got two baptisms today
[50:37] brother miles is going to be baptized
[50:39] today and then uh brother Theo is going
[50:42] to be baptized as well he just kept on
[50:44] us kept after us and uh he wants to be
[50:47] baptized we're want to do that today
[50:49] amen isn't God good to us amen if you
[50:53] need to be baptized and you're here this
[50:54] morning would like to be be baptized or
[50:56] re-baptized be glad to do that as well
[50:58] the waters had a baptism last week we've
[51:00] got one scheduled for next week believe
[51:02] the Lord's doing something you know when
[51:05] when the in the old uh Testament times
[51:07] around the time of Jesus when he came
[51:10] they had a pool of be beeta and it was a
[51:13] pool that was moved by an Angel at a
[51:15] certain time and people waited around
[51:17] that pool and waited and soon as the
[51:19] angel moved the waters the first one in
[51:22] got healed and uh I think we ought to be
[51:25] like that as far as our anticipation
[51:27] although we believe that he's here all
[51:29] the time yes when you see God begin to
[51:31] move try be the first one in participate
[51:34] be a part of that I think God's doing
[51:36] something among us and we appreciate
[51:38] that very much thank you to your parents
[51:40] for teaching your children and bringing
[51:42] them up in the fear and admonition of
[51:44] the Lord I want to speak to you this
[51:45] morning on the law of contrast wasn't it
[51:48] a beautiful
[51:49] morning it was beautiful I walked
[51:52] outside and brother Harvey told me he
[51:53] said my this is beautiful Beau this
[51:55] morning and I it was it was just
[51:58] beautiful and it so cool and nice and
[52:01] but Harvey had the Heat and the air on
[52:03] this morning in the church and and uh
[52:06] you know we we just it was so wonderful
[52:09] and and I walking outside just makes you
[52:11] feel rejuvenated makes you feel young
[52:13] makes you feel like going out and and
[52:15] doing something and and I walked outside
[52:17] and I begin to think about that and and
[52:19] I realized you you know why it feels so
[52:23] good this morning because it was a
[52:25] degrees a few weeks
[52:28] ago right when you couldn't stand
[52:30] outside or your head would get burnt or
[52:32] at least those of us with no
[52:34] hair right you you have a hard time
[52:36] standing out in the sun and it was hot
[52:38] and you get sweaty and and and you just
[52:40] had your feel of that at least some of
[52:42] us did and and it's it's hard it's hard
[52:44] to be a fat man and and it be hot and
[52:47] and so when it begins to cool down you
[52:50] begin to enjoy the the presence or the
[52:53] the feeling in the atmosphere how
[52:55] different it is and it's the contrast
[52:58] that that makes that where you can
[53:00] appreciate it you would never appreciate
[53:03] the fall if there was never a summer you
[53:06] would never appreciate the cool weather
[53:08] if there was never hot weather and so
[53:11] and then it's going to get cold after a
[53:13] while and and we're all going to be
[53:14] freezing to death and we're going to be
[53:16] wearing big coats and we're going to be
[53:17] turning up the heat and sitting beside
[53:19] the fire and we're going to be say boy I
[53:21] can't wait till summer and and we'll be
[53:23] complaining about that but we wouldn't
[53:25] appreciate the summer if it wasn't for
[53:27] the cold weather right so there's a law
[53:30] of contrast and the law of contrast is
[53:32] the idea that you can't really
[53:34] appreciate the value or the beauty of
[53:37] something until you've seen or
[53:39] experienced its opposite right you can't
[53:42] really appreciate something until you've
[53:45] seen its opposite so when they make a
[53:47] painting when a painter paints they're
[53:48] taught the law of contrast that if you
[53:52] make it all one color nothing stands out
[53:54] but what you do is you take a color and
[53:56] you take its opposite color on the color
[53:58] spectrum and you take those two colors
[54:01] and blend them in together to where that
[54:03] the opposite color makes the the real
[54:05] color stand out and so if you'd never
[54:07] been through anything you would never
[54:10] appreciate the good times if you never
[54:12] experienced Darkness you'd never
[54:14] appreciate light if you never
[54:16] experienced hardship you'd never
[54:18] experience a times when it gets a little
[54:20] bit easier and I'll say we've all been
[54:22] through both of those times yeah
[54:26] I think sometimes you've got to
[54:27] experience heartbreak in your life so
[54:30] you can appreciate true
[54:32] relationship and
[54:35] fellowship you've got to have been
[54:37] through some things some loss in order
[54:39] to appreciate the people that you have
[54:42] yeah right Paul deals with this several
[54:44] times in the scripture in Romans chapter
[54:46] n he deals with it as it pertains to
[54:48] election he said hath not the Potter
[54:51] power over the clay of the same lump to
[54:55] make one vessel to honor and another to
[54:59] dishonor what if God willing to show his
[55:02] wrath and to make his power known
[55:06] endured with much longsuffering the
[55:08] vessels of Wrath fitted to destruction
[55:11] sir that he might make known now watch
[55:13] the contrast he endures that that he
[55:16] might make known The Riches of his glory
[55:19] yes sir on the vessels of Mercy which he
[55:22] had a for prepared unto Glory so Paul is
[55:26] is giving us an argument he said what if
[55:28] God allows the wicked to continue to do
[55:31] wickedly what if he allows them to be
[55:34] who they are and to turn him down and to
[55:37] and to do everything that they do just
[55:39] for the purpose of making known The
[55:42] Riches of his glory on the vessels of
[55:44] Mercy what if he allowed Leo DEA to
[55:47] become what it is just so he could show
[55:49] the contrast with the elect bride of
[55:52] this day that is able to overcome to see
[55:55] it oh I tell you what this is a simple
[55:57] thought this morning but it just Thrills
[55:59] my heart what if God was willing was
[56:02] willing to let everybody else around you
[56:05] uh everybody else went back everybody
[56:07] else left the message everybody else
[56:09] didn't do it right but you did why did
[56:11] God do that because he was willing to
[56:14] show The Riches of his glory on a vessel
[56:17] of Mercy I'm so glad to be a vessel of
[56:20] mercy and you had nothing to do with
[56:22] that I had nothing to do with that God
[56:24] was just showing a
[56:27] contrast he said even us whom he hath
[56:30] called not of the Jews only but also of
[56:35] the Gentiles yeah now now watch he makes
[56:38] a contrast in people so we can see who
[56:41] we are yeah right you you don't fully
[56:46] understand who Abel is without Cain
[56:49] right yeah unless Cain is is offered his
[56:52] sacrifice you don't appreciate Abel's
[56:56] sacrifice that's right why do we know
[56:58] Abel offered the right sacrifice not so
[57:01] much because God accepted his because if
[57:03] God had only accepted Abel's sacrifice
[57:05] and not rejected Cain's we would think
[57:08] well maybe there's another sacrifice
[57:09] that could be
[57:10] offered right but he rejects Cain's
[57:13] sacrifice to show us that no other
[57:16] sacrifice other than the blood is able
[57:19] to and I'll say this that the only thing
[57:21] that God accepts today is the blood
[57:23] you've got to have the token you've got
[57:25] to be born again you've got to have the
[57:27] life of the blood right but Cain shows
[57:30] us who Abel is so the darkness of Cain's
[57:33] life stands out in contrast to the light
[57:37] of
[57:38] Abel right you had to be one born of the
[57:41] wicked one so the one who was born uh
[57:44] who was born of Adam and Eve could stand
[57:47] out against it yes oh my there had to be
[57:51] an Isaac and an ishmail God allowed
[57:54] Abraham to make that mistake yeah and
[57:56] you look at what's going on today Isaac
[57:58] and Ishmael are still fighting yeah
[58:00] they're still killing one another
[58:02] they're still going through the the time
[58:04] they're going through in Israel today
[58:05] because those two boys there had to be a
[58:08] contrast and if you look today you can
[58:10] still see here's a people that that
[58:12] believe in God there's God's chosen
[58:14] people and here is a here is a usurper
[58:17] here is a here is a the result of a
[58:20] slightly doubted promise right and so
[58:23] the one stands out against the other and
[58:25] makes the other makes you realize who
[58:27] the other
[58:28] is right you look at the difference in
[58:30] Esau and Jacob yeah and Esau actually uh
[58:35] when you look at him if he was standing
[58:37] alone you would look at him and say he's
[58:39] a pretty good guy he's actually he gets
[58:42] along pretty good with his father he
[58:44] does everything he's supposed to do he's
[58:46] a hunter he's a he's a good man he's a
[58:49] he's a he make a good message brother
[58:51] but you take you take him and hold him
[58:54] against Jacob and you realize that God
[58:57] deals with Jacob in a more Supernatural
[58:59] way yeah Jacob is a worse kind of a
[59:02] fellow he's a kind of a guy brother
[59:04] Brandon calls him a Shyer he's a he's a
[59:06] guy will steal from you if you don't
[59:07] watch it and until he gets his change
[59:10] amen till he meets the angel he's a guy
[59:13] who just doesn't always tell the truth
[59:14] he's kind of a mama's boy kind of a
[59:16] but God used that he used Esau to
[59:19] stand out against Jacob so we can see
[59:22] that the elect it's not of him that
[59:23] runneth it's not of that willth but it's
[59:25] God that shows Mercy aren't you glad of
[59:28] that this morning there might have been
[59:29] people who were better people there
[59:31] might have been people who had a lot of
[59:33] more money there might have been people
[59:34] who had a lot better family but God
[59:36] dealt with you in a supernatural way
[59:39] that he didn't deal with them like that
[59:41] yes sir good are you with me so
[59:44] far God that's why the trip that's why
[59:47] God allows in among School among family
[59:50] among everybody else once you're born
[59:52] again there'll be a contrast between you
[59:54] and the world world you young people
[59:56] there's a contrast between you and the
[59:57] other young people why is that why does
[1:00:00] he make such a contrast between these
[1:00:02] young ladies sitting over here in the
[1:00:03] young ladies of the world why do you
[1:00:05] look so different and dressed so
[1:00:06] different because there's a contrast
[1:00:08] God's
[1:00:09] showing oh my God's showing there's
[1:00:11] something real there may be all kinds of
[1:00:14] mess out there but we would never know
[1:00:16] what it was unless there was a
[1:00:19] contrast right good well I thank God for
[1:00:22] our sisters today yes are you happy you
[1:00:25] aren't you glad we have sisters that are
[1:00:27] still dressed right and live right do
[1:00:29] what's right think we men ought to be uh
[1:00:33] to be proud of our wives and mothers and
[1:00:36] those who and and our daughters who
[1:00:38] dress right and and uh and live right in
[1:00:41] this world it's
[1:00:42] hard but there has to be a
[1:00:45] contrast CU God's going to have a
[1:00:48] bride me just bear with me I my voice is
[1:00:51] not good today but you see contrast
[1:00:53] between Moses and Pharaoh yeah look now
[1:00:57] here both raised in the same
[1:00:59] house right both those boys raised in
[1:01:02] the same house for the same purpose to
[1:01:04] be rulers in Egypt but you find that
[1:01:07] Moses Moses rejected all of that gave up
[1:01:11] all of that gave up everything that he
[1:01:13] was sold himself out to the people of
[1:01:15] God yes I I say that shows election
[1:01:18] right there when you see people that are
[1:01:20] willing to do what it takes to be with
[1:01:22] the people of Goden to to to to believe
[1:01:25] like uh like like what they believed and
[1:01:28] to to take on their uh their it was
[1:01:31] slavery that they were in but he was
[1:01:33] willing to take that on rather than the
[1:01:35] riches of Egypt he did that willingly he
[1:01:38] chose that and it showed a contrast
[1:01:41] between him and Pharaoh there was a
[1:01:42] contrast between Ruth and orpa in the
[1:01:44] Bible when Ruth was uh was a a moabit
[1:01:48] she was just like orpa physically she
[1:01:50] was just like orpa in her in maybe in
[1:01:52] her way she was raised and everything
[1:01:54] else but when the when the testing time
[1:01:57] came the contrast showed up it all
[1:02:00] looked the same until the testing time
[1:02:02] came but when the testing time came Ruth
[1:02:05] clav to her mother-in-law and orpa
[1:02:07] turned back and left oh church I think
[1:02:10] that's the hour we're living in now
[1:02:11] we're living in a testing time yeah the
[1:02:14] message right now is going through a
[1:02:16] testing time are we going to believe
[1:02:17] what a prophet said or we going to
[1:02:19] believe what the world says it's a
[1:02:22] testing time God's going to prove who
[1:02:24] you are he's going to make a
[1:02:26] contrast between those who believe and
[1:02:28] those who do not believe
[1:02:30] yeah there's a contrast between David
[1:02:33] and
[1:02:34] Saul right they're both Kings of Israel
[1:02:37] yeah but look at the difference you'd
[1:02:38] never appreciate
[1:02:40] David unless you had a Saul yeah right
[1:02:45] you never
[1:02:46] appreciate Oh my Jesus like we do unless
[1:02:50] there was a
[1:02:52] Judas unless there was a Pharisee yeah
[1:02:55] unless there was whoever in that day
[1:02:57] would be a contrast to Christ right so
[1:03:01] the lives of these stand against one
[1:03:03] another brother brandham talks a lot
[1:03:05] about this and he talks about an
[1:03:07] elevator operator and he told him he was
[1:03:09] on the elevator and and he told him he
[1:03:11] said you know he said you have an up and
[1:03:13] down
[1:03:14] job some of you will get that
[1:03:18] later but brother brand said we life is
[1:03:20] like
[1:03:21] that it's like an elevator operator he
[1:03:24] said OU know we don't enjoy the UPS L we
[1:03:26] have the
[1:03:27] Downs said you realize we wouldn't have
[1:03:29] any mountains if we didn't have any
[1:03:30] valleys yeah you wouldn't appreciate the
[1:03:33] sunshine if there wasn't any night you
[1:03:36] said in a person sometimes in very very
[1:03:38] good health maybe they don't know how to
[1:03:39] appreciate let's they had a real sick
[1:03:41] spell sometime and almost died then they
[1:03:45] can appreciate your good health he said
[1:03:47] it's the law of contrast I believe yeah
[1:03:50] I I got a phone call this morning from
[1:03:52] Brother Paul Seymour he wanted to be
[1:03:55] here today but he he got in a fight with
[1:03:57] a cow and and uh the cow won and and he
[1:04:01] broke his leg and brother Paul broke his
[1:04:03] leg and and Gabe you can empathize with
[1:04:06] that a little bit he's he's going
[1:04:08] through it right now and his wife has
[1:04:10] got a rotator cuff injury so they're
[1:04:12] both kind of down and he told me this
[1:04:14] morning I think they're watching this
[1:04:16] morning he told me he said he said
[1:04:17] brother Ben he said he said I he said my
[1:04:20] wife's got this rotator cuff injury and
[1:04:22] I got this broken leg he said but then I
[1:04:23] see people that are really disabled and
[1:04:25] I thank God for his
[1:04:28] blessings right we can all do that this
[1:04:31] morning it's the contrast I know this is
[1:04:34] simple this morning but it ought to mean
[1:04:35] something to our heart it's the contrast
[1:04:37] that makes the
[1:04:39] difference brother Brown said he
[1:04:41] wouldn't appreciate good health without
[1:04:42] sickness sir he said brother Brown says
[1:04:45] this he said don't be scared God is
[1:04:47] driving the winds God is driving the ark
[1:04:50] he has all things provided someone said
[1:04:52] all things he said why Noah wouldn't
[1:04:55] have had any victories there wouldn't
[1:04:56] have been storms and trials he said if
[1:04:59] we're just put through a little safe
[1:05:00] tunnel to run through there's no joy
[1:05:03] yeah oh my brother Ben why did I have to
[1:05:06] come up the way that I did why did I
[1:05:08] have to Backside like I did why did I
[1:05:10] why was I maybe out in the world didn't
[1:05:12] know the message of the hour and now I
[1:05:13] come back why did I have to come up the
[1:05:15] way that I did seem like a winding road
[1:05:17] because if he put you through a tunnel a
[1:05:19] safe little tunnel there'd be no joy but
[1:05:22] he let you experience the storm of life
[1:05:24] he said that's what makes us have the
[1:05:26] joy that's why You' got joy in your
[1:05:28] heart this morning because you've been
[1:05:30] through the storm and you know God kept
[1:05:32] you through the
[1:05:34] storm we would never know what daylight
[1:05:36] was L we had some dark we would never
[1:05:38] know what a Hilltop was L we had a
[1:05:40] mountain amen we never know what good
[1:05:42] health was unless we had some sickness
[1:05:44] you never know how to enjoy salvation
[1:05:46] unless you once was a sinner God has
[1:05:48] made all things the law of contrast he
[1:05:51] said he loves you do you believe that
[1:05:53] this morning
[1:05:54] you would never know how to appreciate a
[1:05:56] day if you didn't have a night yeah you
[1:05:58] would never know how to appreciate the
[1:05:59] sunshine if you didn't have a cloudy day
[1:06:01] you'd never know how to appreciate
[1:06:03] righteousness unless you had some
[1:06:05] unrighteousness You' never know how to
[1:06:07] appreciate good health unless you had
[1:06:09] some foul Health some bad Health he said
[1:06:11] that's the reason I think we'll
[1:06:12] appreciate heaven so much because we've
[1:06:14] lived on earth
[1:06:16] once oh I think we get all say Amen to
[1:06:18] that I know the the brothers from West
[1:06:20] Plains that aren't here this morning
[1:06:21] sister Fritz and and brother JT and and
[1:06:23] sister Mr cledith I know that they
[1:06:25] appreciate they know how to appreciate
[1:06:27] Heaven because you get close to the end
[1:06:29] and your body starts to break down
[1:06:31] brother Bill I know you and sister
[1:06:32] Curtis you appreciate Heaven because you
[1:06:34] know your body just doesn't do what it
[1:06:36] used to do you just can't move like you
[1:06:38] used to move and it makes you realize
[1:06:39] there's a better place somewhere because
[1:06:41] I was young once now I'm old but Paul
[1:06:43] said or or David said I've never seen
[1:06:45] the righteous forsaken or the seed
[1:06:48] beging bread but you've lived a life
[1:06:50] that you you you begin to realize that
[1:06:52] this isn't all there is yeah Paul said
[1:06:55] if in this life only we have hope we are
[1:06:57] of all men most
[1:06:59] miserable but there's a heaven that's
[1:07:01] real but the said it's a more real place
[1:07:04] than than this one and we have a prophet
[1:07:06] who went there and came back and told us
[1:07:08] he would meet us there
[1:07:10] amen amen oh do you love the Lord this
[1:07:15] morning
[1:07:19] amen turned that off and didn't get it
[1:07:22] done we don't
[1:07:24] appreciate good health unless we get
[1:07:28] sick there ain't going to be no paing in
[1:07:31] heaven I'll fight you over
[1:07:35] that no change of the
[1:07:37] weather but because we've experienced
[1:07:40] what it's like to live in a body of
[1:07:42] corruption yeah we'll be we'll have some
[1:07:45] Joy when we get to
[1:07:47] heaven amen amen we've lived on earth
[1:07:51] once but the B said the reason we appr
[1:07:53] appreciate the holy spirit so much is
[1:07:57] because we live so long in a church come
[1:07:59] on now that told us there was no such
[1:08:01] thing
[1:08:02] yes Hallelujah the reason oh my I could
[1:08:06] stop there and Shout for a while yes
[1:08:09] amen the reason we appreciate it tonight
[1:08:12] is because we've had the other
[1:08:16] side and that's the way God has intended
[1:08:19] it to be because his people has had
[1:08:21] their ups and downs yes feel like an
[1:08:25] elevator operator sometimes don't you
[1:08:27] today we're up going up then we're down
[1:08:31] tomorrow we're up and then we're down
[1:08:33] but you realize you reach a place in
[1:08:34] your spiritual experience that you don't
[1:08:36] go up with the ups and down with the
[1:08:38] downs but you've reached a place where
[1:08:40] you know God will take care of me he
[1:08:42] loves me I'm his child I belong to him
[1:08:44] he's been with me through the Downs
[1:08:46] he'll be with me through the ups he'll
[1:08:47] be with me all the way
[1:08:49] through I begin to trust it I begin to
[1:08:52] realize this elevator works
[1:08:54] amen amen the one who's got it under his
[1:08:57] control he makes it work listen he said
[1:08:59] the reason we appreciate the holy spirit
[1:09:01] so much is because we lived so long in a
[1:09:03] church that told us there was no such a
[1:09:05] thing the reason we appreciate it
[1:09:07] tonight is because we have had the other
[1:09:09] side yeah and that's the way God has
[1:09:11] intended it to be because his people has
[1:09:13] their ups and downs you never know how
[1:09:14] to appreciate a Mountaintop unless
[1:09:16] you've been in the valley and so you
[1:09:18] never know how to appreciate good water
[1:09:20] unless you drank some bad
[1:09:22] sometime all the way through it's a law
[1:09:24] of
[1:09:26] contrast again brother BR said now
[1:09:28] remember we're finite our minds are
[1:09:30] finite God is infinite yeah an infinite
[1:09:34] is perfect right he said a savior yes
[1:09:39] which was first A Healer or a sickness
[1:09:42] he said God permitted it that he might
[1:09:44] project his love and power to the human
[1:09:47] race remember when they asked Jesus
[1:09:49] about the blind man they said which one
[1:09:51] sinned him or his parents and Jesus said
[1:09:54] neither one did
[1:09:56] amen you know you look at that and think
[1:09:59] you say well I'm I'm I'm just so I've
[1:10:02] messed up so bad brother Ben why did I
[1:10:04] have to mess up like that God permitted
[1:10:06] it and I don't say we should look at our
[1:10:08] future like that I think we should do
[1:10:10] the very best that we can but remember
[1:10:12] what's what is in the past is in the
[1:10:15] past and what happened last minute in
[1:10:18] the last minute is in the past yeah all
[1:10:21] we have is now in the future yeah that's
[1:10:23] all we have we don't have anything else
[1:10:25] yeah so quit looking in the past you
[1:10:27] can't drive down the road looking in the
[1:10:28] rearview mirror you've got to be able to
[1:10:30] look beyond that and be able to see
[1:10:31] something out ahead of you you if the
[1:10:33] church has no vision if it's just
[1:10:35] constantly looking at what has happened
[1:10:37] and what happened in the past you'll die
[1:10:39] you'll shrivel up and die but if we can
[1:10:40] ever look at what God's doing right now
[1:10:42] look what he's doing among the young
[1:10:44] people look what he's doing for our
[1:10:45] families look what he's doing here in
[1:10:47] the house of God I believe God's moving
[1:10:49] right now let's look at that come on you
[1:10:52] get caught up looking at the past
[1:10:53] looking at the back looking behind you
[1:10:55] you'll fall you'll wreck every time but
[1:10:57] there's got to be something that God's
[1:10:59] doing right now brother brand said let's
[1:11:01] find out what God's doing and get with
[1:11:03] it amen get with the
[1:11:05] program amen what was first a savior a
[1:11:08] sinner a savior amen God permitted it
[1:11:12] now brother BR when we're brought in the
[1:11:14] presence of the Lord Jesus that is
[1:11:15] coming there will be a million Angels
[1:11:17] stand around the earth with bowed heads
[1:11:20] listening at the church
[1:11:22] sing glory to God oh I'm M it makes me
[1:11:26] want to sing even though I can't listen
[1:11:28] at the church sing the songs of
[1:11:30] redemption not knowing what we are
[1:11:32] talking about oh my they've never been
[1:11:35] lost yeah Angels cannot worship like we
[1:11:39] can worship Angel oh Hallelujah Angels
[1:11:42] cannot praise like we can praise they
[1:11:45] can't follow the word back the word like
[1:11:47] we can why because they've never been
[1:11:49] they've never been
[1:11:51] lost so they oh my yeah you realize
[1:11:55] there's no Redemption for Angels right
[1:11:57] once they made their decision to fall
[1:11:58] they couldn't come back right but you're
[1:12:00] special people because God chose a
[1:12:02] people that was redeemable somebody that
[1:12:04] had something that was in his mind
[1:12:06] before the foundation of the earth that
[1:12:07] had a place they could come back to Esa
[1:12:09] could not repent but you cannot be
[1:12:12] lost glory to God prise the Lord
[1:12:21] amen hallelujah
[1:12:24] he said that You' they've never been
[1:12:25] lost they don't know what it means to be
[1:12:28] lost you and I know what it means
[1:12:30] they've never been sick they don't know
[1:12:32] how to Rejoice over healing
[1:12:34] sir but you let a person who's had who's
[1:12:37] been sick you realize my you realize how
[1:12:40] much you appreciate your children if it
[1:12:42] was difficult to get them into the world
[1:12:45] it's always difficult to get children
[1:12:46] into the
[1:12:47] world that's right it's a hard it's a
[1:12:51] hard occasion very difficult
[1:12:53] and a mother comes very close to death
[1:12:57] at the time she has a baby and you
[1:12:59] realize that you begin to consider that
[1:13:01] you realize that why is there so much
[1:13:03] pain but the mother very quickly forgets
[1:13:06] the pain at the joy of the new birth
[1:13:09] right at the joy of holding their baby
[1:13:11] very quickly they forget the pain but if
[1:13:14] there was no pain we would not
[1:13:15] appreciate children like we
[1:13:19] do that's righted that's right if there
[1:13:22] was no oh my but you know I think that's
[1:13:24] what makes a mother sometimes so close
[1:13:27] to a child is because they went through
[1:13:29] the pain and I'll say this you say well
[1:13:30] I adopted my children and but there's
[1:13:32] pain associated with that too that's
[1:13:34] right I tell you what there's more pain
[1:13:37] when they're teenagers than when they're
[1:13:41] little all those of teenagers say amen
[1:13:45] amen that's just true especially as they
[1:13:47] get old enough to kind of want to do
[1:13:49] their own thing you know you got to just
[1:13:51] have those battles but Peter didn't want
[1:13:53] to shave this morning and I had to make
[1:13:55] him you know that
[1:13:57] just sometimes you just got to do what's
[1:13:59] best for the child you know it
[1:14:04] just sometimes you just got to do what's
[1:14:06] best a't that right and the teenager he
[1:14:09] don't you know they they got an idea
[1:14:11] what they want to do and they're fixing
[1:14:12] to be an adult fixing to be able to make
[1:14:14] their own decisions and and so there's
[1:14:16] pain in that you know I've been told and
[1:14:19] I don't know this by experience but I've
[1:14:20] been told once they get older and they
[1:14:21] leave home there's real pain
[1:14:24] sometimes you can't you see mistakes
[1:14:26] that they're making there's nothing you
[1:14:27] can do about it all you can do is say I
[1:14:29] still love you that's right you can
[1:14:31] always come home amen there will be a
[1:14:34] place for you but I can't do I can't fix
[1:14:36] it yeah I wish I
[1:14:39] could you ever have a baby that's sick
[1:14:42] and it's so sick and there's nothing you
[1:14:43] can do about it and you sit there by the
[1:14:45] day and you think what if I'd do
[1:14:47] anything see my baby well do anything to
[1:14:50] see them not I'd suffer myself to see my
[1:14:52] baby not be suffering but you can't do
[1:14:54] that for them but you do have a savior
[1:14:56] you do have a Healer you do know
[1:14:58] somebody and you can appreciate your
[1:15:00] children because of the pain associated
[1:15:03] with raising
[1:15:05] children oh God we can appreciate a
[1:15:08] church you realize a church is not
[1:15:10] always it's it's not always good there's
[1:15:12] there's always going to be little things
[1:15:13] that go wrong there's always going to be
[1:15:15] little spats little things that happen
[1:15:17] nothing like that going on right now but
[1:15:19] there's always going to be stuff and
[1:15:21] always going to be people that don't get
[1:15:22] along and little things people think you
[1:15:24] made a wrong decision here the deacons
[1:15:26] did this or the trustees did that and
[1:15:28] everybody there's always going to be a
[1:15:29] little tension in a church but if it
[1:15:31] wasn't for the tension we wouldn't be
[1:15:32] able to stand up and be who we are God
[1:15:35] made it that way we wouldn't appreciate
[1:15:37] a service like this morning when the
[1:15:39] presence of God is just so real and you
[1:15:41] can and and the and the unity is so real
[1:15:43] you wouldn't appreciate that unless
[1:15:44] you've been through some when a pastor
[1:15:46] had to just pull out his sword and start
[1:15:48] to go to
[1:15:49] work right so you there there's got to
[1:15:52] be a cont
[1:15:54] and that's why I think it's lost today
[1:15:56] in the message because many times we I'm
[1:15:58] not being critical I'm trying not to be
[1:16:00] critical this morning but many times we
[1:16:02] just we're just one note we just want we
[1:16:04] just want all meetings all the time or
[1:16:06] or else we want just uh all dead all the
[1:16:08] time or or just all teaching all the
[1:16:10] time people whatever their favorite is
[1:16:12] they just want that but God has a
[1:16:14] variety for a reason there's a variety
[1:16:16] of preachers for a reason there's a
[1:16:18] variety of churches for a reason we're
[1:16:21] not all the same but we all belong to
[1:16:23] God just like he has black flowers and
[1:16:25] yellow I don't know if he has black I
[1:16:27] guess there's black flowers yellow
[1:16:28] flowers uh there's purple flowers
[1:16:31] whatever other kind of flower that there
[1:16:32] is he's got all kinds of colors of
[1:16:34] flowers right got all kinds of colors of
[1:16:37] flowers I talking about flowers all
[1:16:39] kinds of colors of flowers but there's
[1:16:41] but but there's a difference why does he
[1:16:43] do that because he loves the
[1:16:45] variety brother Brown said he's not a
[1:16:47] serious and robu Harmony House right now
[1:16:50] some of you remember serious and robu
[1:16:52] cuz you had that in your in your
[1:16:58] restroom we had a church when I was very
[1:17:00] young we didn't have indoor plumbing
[1:17:02] thank God for what we have today if it
[1:17:04] wasn't for that you'd never know the
[1:17:10] contrast I'm well I'm way I'm
[1:17:13] dangerously off my notes this
[1:17:17] morning you never have any contrast if
[1:17:20] you hadn't been through some things Joel
[1:17:22] some of those Services we set through
[1:17:23] his children we wouldn't appreciate what
[1:17:25] we have today you know why we love being
[1:17:26] in the house of God cuz we didn't always
[1:17:29] have it this easy
[1:17:32] yeah didn't always feel the freedom that
[1:17:35] we feel now we've been through some
[1:17:38] things some of y'all been through some
[1:17:39] things and so you appreciate the the
[1:17:41] house of God cuz there's been a contrast
[1:17:44] right Hallelujah he said if there' never
[1:17:47] been any evil there' never been no good
[1:17:50] if there had never been no night there
[1:17:51] never know nothing but day you see the
[1:17:53] the law of contrast it must be that way
[1:17:55] yes he said that began in Eden and the
[1:17:57] Garden of Eden sin was so beautiful
[1:17:59] until it attracted Eve from
[1:18:00] righteousness to sin and in the same
[1:18:02] Garden where there was a tree of life
[1:18:04] there was also a tree of death we would
[1:18:07] know it today as the law of contrast
[1:18:09] that where there is good there is evil
[1:18:10] where there is right there is wrong and
[1:18:12] we will never no matter what our
[1:18:13] environment may be ever be able to shake
[1:18:16] ourselves from the presence of
[1:18:20] either now think about it for a minute
[1:18:22] you could be in the best meeting you can
[1:18:24] be enjoying God you could be sitting
[1:18:25] here this morning just enjoying the
[1:18:27] presence of God and get a
[1:18:29] headache you could be sitting here
[1:18:31] thinking about the things of God and all
[1:18:33] of a sudden a thought come in your mind
[1:18:34] and you begin to worry and you begin to
[1:18:35] fuss why is that because it's always
[1:18:38] present yeah the contrast is always
[1:18:41] there he said where there is good there
[1:18:43] is evil he said where there is right
[1:18:45] there is wrong so no matter what our
[1:18:47] environment may be we'll never be able
[1:18:49] to shake oursel from the presence of
[1:18:50] either because Paul said when I would do
[1:18:52] good evil is present The Sinner will
[1:18:54] never be able to shake away from the
[1:18:55] Christian the Christian from The Sinner
[1:18:58] he said there will be a witness thereof
[1:19:00] right and a testimony of wrong always oh
[1:19:03] my these people that believe well we'll
[1:19:05] all just get together and at the end and
[1:19:07] we'll all just be in one place on the
[1:19:08] earth brother BR said we wouldn't be
[1:19:10] right right he said the Rapture would be
[1:19:11] Universal everywhere that that we were
[1:19:13] where there's one here and one there but
[1:19:17] but we're not going to all get together
[1:19:18] in one place because there's always
[1:19:19] going to be evil prisoners always going
[1:19:20] to be three kinds of Believers yeah
[1:19:23] always going to be a mixed multitude
[1:19:25] it's just the way that it is Paul said
[1:19:27] when I would do good and evil is present
[1:19:29] he said and you make your choice yeah
[1:19:32] you make your choice you have to take
[1:19:34] one side or the other I want to take the
[1:19:36] right side don't
[1:19:38] you Romans 7:21 let's look at that for
[1:19:40] just a minute this is what brother
[1:19:41] randam is talking about what he's
[1:19:43] referencing he said I find in a law this
[1:19:45] is Paul speaking when I would do good
[1:19:47] evil is present with me yes I Delight in
[1:19:50] the law of God after the inward man but
[1:19:53] I see another law in my members Waring
[1:19:55] against the law of my mind and bringing
[1:19:57] me into captivity to the law of sin
[1:19:59] which is in my members oh Wretched Man
[1:20:02] that I am who shall deliver me from the
[1:20:05] body of this dead how can I ever do
[1:20:07] anything good how can I ever serve the
[1:20:09] Lord how can I ever do what's right but
[1:20:11] you're doing what's right this morning
[1:20:13] why because he said I thank God through
[1:20:15] Jesus Christ Our Lord so then with the
[1:20:18] mind I myself serve the law of God but
[1:20:21] with the flesh the law of
[1:20:23] sin are you with me so far the contrast
[1:20:26] evil is always present that's why uh you
[1:20:29] know we we'd fill this place up if we
[1:20:31] ever got everybody here at the same time
[1:20:34] you know why we don't it's not because
[1:20:35] people are bad it's because there's evil
[1:20:37] is present yeah sickness is present uh
[1:20:40] Satan is present there's all kinds of
[1:20:42] things that that that happen yes sir
[1:20:44] right and so that that that's just
[1:20:46] that's just the way it's going to be
[1:20:48] until we leave here that's right the
[1:20:50] miracle of Pentecost the real Miracle of
[1:20:52] Pentecost was getting 120 people in one
[1:20:54] Accord in one
[1:20:57] place getting them all to be there yeah
[1:21:00] that's a miracle and stay there for 10
[1:21:02] days it's a miracle but they had a
[1:21:05] reason to be there a reason to stay
[1:21:07] there but I'll say this that evil was
[1:21:09] even present there and even there Satan
[1:21:12] tried to get them to leave early tried
[1:21:13] to get them but Peter stood up and said
[1:21:15] I believe that he told us to wait until
[1:21:18] yes amen and they did until the power
[1:21:21] fell but the brand said what is it he
[1:21:23] said My Flesh says tonight you're too
[1:21:24] tired your throat is too sore you've
[1:21:27] been out in the wind today you shall not
[1:21:28] go to church tonight that's just flesh
[1:21:32] talking you shall not whenever you hear
[1:21:34] those words that's the flesh talking you
[1:21:37] shall not go to church
[1:21:38] tonight he said That's the Law of the
[1:21:40] flesh you just might as well call them
[1:21:43] up and tell brother Neville he said send
[1:21:45] the questions down tell him to answer
[1:21:47] them he said but you see I promised to
[1:21:48] do it he said now my mind on the inside
[1:21:51] the holy spirit said you keep your
[1:21:52] promise promise but the flesh said
[1:21:54] you're too tired now the flesh say now
[1:21:56] there's no need you pretty little thing
[1:21:59] you're the prettiest little thing in
[1:22:01] school no don't you pay any attention to
[1:22:03] that Holy Roller mother of yours or that
[1:22:05] fanatic
[1:22:06] father yeah preaching at you girls
[1:22:11] now you young
[1:22:14] ladies oh he said don't pay any
[1:22:16] attention that's the flesh speaking
[1:22:17] right you're you're the best looking
[1:22:19] girl in school you're the prettiest boy
[1:22:21] prettiest boy the best looking boy he
[1:22:24] said the best built he was like praise
[1:22:29] God you're the most popular there is in
[1:22:32] the city he said you see he said you
[1:22:34] yield your members to that and where do
[1:22:37] you come out at little end of the horn
[1:22:39] every
[1:22:40] time Paul said My Flesh
[1:22:43] always wants always to yield to that and
[1:22:48] he said your flesh does too now that's
[1:22:52] good solid teaching isn't it my flesh
[1:22:54] always wants to yield to that your flesh
[1:22:57] does too you said but brother B if I
[1:22:59] ever felt like going to church I'd go to
[1:23:00] church when when I get to where I feel
[1:23:02] like I I want to be in church then I'll
[1:23:04] go to church you'll never go to church
[1:23:07] when I get to where I I feel like you
[1:23:09] know I feel like well you know if you
[1:23:11] only sent your kids to school when they
[1:23:12] felt like going to school they would
[1:23:14] never

[1:23:19] like going to school today
[1:23:20] nope you ask a 16 year old you feel like
[1:23:23] going to school today no way most of
[1:23:26] them right on most days most children
[1:23:29] don't want to be in school but you send
[1:23:31] them because it's good for them and you
[1:23:33] come to church cuz it's good for
[1:23:35] you and you and I'm not talking about
[1:23:37] coming to church but worshiping and
[1:23:39] praising God and participating in the
[1:23:41] service if you only rais your hands when
[1:23:43] you felt like raising your hands you'd
[1:23:46] never raise your
[1:23:47] hands cuz the devil's always going to
[1:23:49] give you a reason not
[1:23:51] to if you only shout you say brother Ben
[1:23:54] someday I'm going to shout if I had a
[1:23:56] dollar for every time I had somebody
[1:23:57] walk in that office and tell me brother
[1:23:59] Ben one of these I almost got up and
[1:24:02] ran I tell you what was have been during
[1:24:04] that preaching I got so excited I almost
[1:24:07] got up and ran I told Brother Isaac uh
[1:24:10] or no brother uh brother Levi I told
[1:24:12] Brother Levi uh one time he was sitting
[1:24:15] up here he's back there now I see him
[1:24:17] back here just barely but I thought
[1:24:19] Landon was out of church today I forgot
[1:24:20] he was back there
[1:24:23] but but I I saw Levi sitting up here and
[1:24:25] I told him I said if I ever get you to
[1:24:27] nod in church he said I said I'm going
[1:24:29] to run the
[1:24:31] aisles well he did nod and I didn't
[1:24:35] run CU I didn't feel like
[1:24:38] it but you know what you know what that
[1:24:41] is if we wait till we feel like it we'll
[1:24:43] never do
[1:24:44] it God he deserves the glory he deserves
[1:24:48] the honor he deserves it on Monday and
[1:24:50] Tuesday and Wednesday and Friday he
[1:24:52] deserves and every day of the week not
[1:24:54] just when we feel like it all
[1:24:57] right right oh brother brand said but
[1:25:01] the law of the spirit of God in the
[1:25:04] heart overcomes the flesh yeah not the
[1:25:07] law of the
[1:25:09] pastor not the law of your dad or your
[1:25:11] mom or your uncle or your aunt or your
[1:25:13] grandpa they they might be disappointed
[1:25:15] if I didn't go know the law of the
[1:25:17] spirit of God in your heart amen that's
[1:25:20] what makes you want to worship God he
[1:25:22] said it overcomes the Flesh and makes
[1:25:24] the body obey what the heart says do Oh
[1:25:27] my he said hallelujah look then he said
[1:25:30] if it will do that for a sinner won't
[1:25:31] that work for sickness too he said the
[1:25:34] law of the spirit of God and the heart
[1:25:35] that knows that by his stripes we were
[1:25:36] healed they stand with their power and
[1:25:38] make that sickness in that body obey
[1:25:41] them because it's a devil he said now
[1:25:44] the law of sin and death works in your
[1:25:46] flesh but the law of the spirit of Life
[1:25:48] Works in your heart so your heart your
[1:25:50] spirit in your heart will make your body
[1:25:52] body obey what it says
[1:25:54] do oh my oh you s those that are sick
[1:25:57] today and some many couldn't be here and
[1:25:59] I know you want to be here but you
[1:26:00] couldn't be here because you're sick
[1:26:02] remember your body obeys what your heart
[1:26:04] says do yeah let the heart speak this
[1:26:07] morning let it speak the word of God I
[1:26:10] am healed I am strong I am a
[1:26:15] believer are you with me so
[1:26:17] far he said he said that's exactly right
[1:26:20] now that's what Paul said always the
[1:26:22] flesh I'm too tired I'm unable I'm not
[1:26:24] sufficient I cannot do it he he talked
[1:26:27] about his sister Dolores and Dolores
[1:26:29] said she was just about to shout you
[1:26:31] know just about to run the aisles just
[1:26:33] about to act up in church and she said
[1:26:35] she she didn't she said I felt bad all
[1:26:37] of a sudden she said what made me feel
[1:26:39] that way just at the time I should have
[1:26:41] felt good I said the devil he said he's
[1:26:45] seen you just ready to receive it that's
[1:26:47] right he said I'll put a little damper
[1:26:48] on her Oh my he said fan her a little
[1:26:51] bit you know kind of cool down a
[1:26:54] little all right yeah you ever felt that
[1:26:57] breath of the
[1:26:59] devil right yeah every time brother
[1:27:02] Wyatt just about to run the
[1:27:05] aisles That Old Devil
[1:27:08] just are you with me now I know we're
[1:27:10] not all aisle Runners I'm just using
[1:27:12] that as an
[1:27:13] example yeah right you you feel that
[1:27:17] every time you're about to worship every
[1:27:18] time you're about to come to the Altar
[1:27:20] and you really feel convicted you you
[1:27:22] know you should come and you know you
[1:27:24] need to give your heart to God you know
[1:27:26] you there's things you need to
[1:27:28] surrender but that that's right that's
[1:27:31] good just cool as you down you start
[1:27:33] thinking about the roast at home if the
[1:27:36] service goes a little bit long that
[1:27:38] maybe it'll hinder somebody else or
[1:27:40] maybe they'll all look at me maybe I'm
[1:27:42] not dressed appropriately maybe I'm not
[1:27:45] this that or the other what'll happen
[1:27:47] what happens it's the devil yeah trying
[1:27:49] to put a damper on what God's trying to
[1:27:51] God's trying trying to build a fire
[1:27:53] right and the devil's operating the
[1:27:54] damper yeah trying to close it trying to
[1:27:56] turn it down what do you got to do take
[1:27:58] over yeah that's right brother Peter was
[1:28:01] building a fire I'm sorry Peter brother
[1:28:03] Peter was building a fire yesterday and
[1:28:06] and he I've taught him how to how to
[1:28:07] start the charcoal grill so I don't have
[1:28:09] to my goal in life is to have my
[1:28:11] children do everything for
[1:28:14] me is that right so so Peter has learned
[1:28:18] how to start the charcoal grill and it's
[1:28:20] just as easy as gas if somebody else
[1:28:22] does
[1:28:24] it and so what
[1:28:26] I so what I've done is I taught him how
[1:28:29] to do that but I went I've told him I
[1:28:31] said leave leave the flu open if you
[1:28:33] want to start a hot fire and especially
[1:28:35] when you're starting out leave the flu
[1:28:38] open on the grill it's got to draw
[1:28:41] oxygen got to draw air through the coals
[1:28:44] so yesterday he's got a lot of smoke and
[1:28:47] not a whole lot of fire and he comes in
[1:28:49] there and and he says I've done
[1:28:50] everything you said do but I just just
[1:28:52] can't get that fire going and and I said
[1:28:54] are both vents open he said well the top
[1:28:57] vents open I said is the bottom vent
[1:29:00] open well not all the way well there's
[1:29:01] your
[1:29:03] problem right if the vent is closed at
[1:29:06] all listen to me church if you let the
[1:29:08] devil get to Clos in your vent all
[1:29:10] you'll get is smoke yeah but if you can
[1:29:13] ever let it just get Open Lord I'll
[1:29:15] accept whatever you whatever you want me
[1:29:17] to do Lord that's what I'll do whatever
[1:29:19] you want me to believe that's what I
[1:29:20] believe I'm not bringing any of my
[1:29:23] preconceived notions I'm not going to
[1:29:24] put my damper on the word of God I'm
[1:29:27] going to let the word flow through me
[1:29:29] it'll ignite that fire in your life and
[1:29:30] it'll change you it'll make you a new
[1:29:34] [Applause]
[1:29:38] person he
[1:29:40] said he said Oh my he said that's when
[1:29:43] you rise how many believe that today
[1:29:46] claim your god-given rights he said
[1:29:49] that's what Paul was meaning always when
[1:29:51] he said when when I would do good evil
[1:29:53] is present let's look at 2 Corinthians
[1:29:55] 4:8 now and I uh I'm I'm pulled a
[1:29:58] brother Joel this morning I forgot to
[1:29:59] start my timer but I can see we're about
[1:30:02] 10 till 12 just in case yall were
[1:30:04] wondering and so we'll be done about the
[1:30:06] right time I think but let's just go
[1:30:08] into this now in 2 Corinthians
[1:30:10] 4:8 we are troubled on every side you
[1:30:15] ever feel that way yeah I preached when
[1:30:17] here not long ago I preached a message
[1:30:19] on that at another church and we we
[1:30:21] preached about Revival and David said in
[1:30:24] the midst of trouble thou will revive me
[1:30:27] Amen in the midst of trouble thou will
[1:30:29] revive me he said we are troubled on
[1:30:31] every side yet not
[1:30:34] distressed distressed or troubled rather
[1:30:37] is is to crush to oppress to
[1:30:41] compress it it describes a crowd
[1:30:44] pressing together it relates to
[1:30:46] oppression or Affliction you ever felt
[1:30:50] like the enemy's all around you yeah
[1:30:53] oppressing you he said we are oppressed
[1:30:56] we are troubled yet not
[1:31:00] distressed oh my we are troubled but not
[1:31:04] distressed we are oppressed but not
[1:31:07] distressed distress means to cramp or to
[1:31:10] restrain yeah oh my we are troubled now
[1:31:14] there's the law of contrast we're
[1:31:16] troubled all of us are we go through
[1:31:19] trouble but we are not stressed yeah
[1:31:23] amen we are not restrained in other
[1:31:26] words we can do what God calls us to do
[1:31:30] you believe that today yeah I'm troubled
[1:31:32] but not
[1:31:33] distressed we are constantly Afflicted
[1:31:37] but not hmed in yeah amen listen listen
[1:31:40] to this listen to this uh Amplified
[1:31:43] version said we are hedged in pressed on
[1:31:45] every side troubled and oppressed in
[1:31:48] every way but not cramped or crushed oh
[1:31:51] my
[1:31:52] right amen we still have our
[1:31:55] freedom even though we are
[1:31:57] troubled B said you know that's a trick
[1:32:00] of the devil to oppress but when the
[1:32:02] Christian knows his legal rights he said
[1:32:04] when you can quote God's word I'll never
[1:32:06] leave thee nor forsake thee that takes
[1:32:08] all the oppression away and the clouds
[1:32:10] begin to clear back but if you just know
[1:32:12] that God has promised and God is
[1:32:14] faithful he can keep his promise or he
[1:32:17] would have never promised
[1:32:18] it second Corinthians 4:8 we are
[1:32:23] perplexed now watch it is not wrong to
[1:32:27] be
[1:32:28] perplexed we are
[1:32:30] perplexed but we are not in
[1:32:32] despair the word perplexed is to have no
[1:32:35] way out to be at a loss
[1:32:37] mentally you ever you ever been that way
[1:32:40] you just don't know what to do yeah
[1:32:42] we're
[1:32:44] perplexed but not despaired so in other
[1:32:47] words not at my Wit's End not despaired
[1:32:49] not not completely out of options yeah
[1:32:52] because I have always hope in
[1:32:55] Christ listen we suffer embarrassments
[1:32:58] and are perplexed and unable to find a
[1:33:01] way out but not driven to
[1:33:03] despair I think of the three Huber
[1:33:06] children is a great example of how that
[1:33:08] they had no way out of that fiery
[1:33:10] furnace and they even knew they said our
[1:33:13] God is able to deliver us but even if he
[1:33:16] doesn't we will not bow to the image oh
[1:33:19] I pray that there' be some young people
[1:33:21] today that would say I don't know how
[1:33:23] I'm going to make it but I'm going to
[1:33:24] make it I don't know how I'm going to
[1:33:26] get out of this fiery furnace but I'm
[1:33:28] I'm coming out on the other side and
[1:33:30] they come out without even the smell of
[1:33:31] smoke on them right why because they
[1:33:34] they were they were they didn't see a
[1:33:36] way out they were perplexed but not in
[1:33:38] despair right the disciples in the boat
[1:33:41] when they were in the boat despairing of
[1:33:43] Life they were down there oh being
[1:33:45] tossed by the ocean brother Bram said
[1:33:47] the devil thought that they went off
[1:33:48] without their Lord but what did he do he
[1:33:51] climbed up on top of a mountain was s up
[1:33:52] there watching that little ship as she
[1:33:55] was bouncing in the sea he said oh I'm
[1:33:57] so glad tonight that he climbed the
[1:33:58] ramper of glory and sets in the Majesty
[1:34:00] on high and his eyes is on the sparrow
[1:34:03] and I know he watches me amen and he
[1:34:05] watches you just in the darkest of the
[1:34:08] hour when every pitch seemed to be the
[1:34:09] last one then Jesus comes along walking
[1:34:12] on the sea he said I want you to notice
[1:34:14] they were helpless hopeless despairing
[1:34:16] and when they saw him they were scared
[1:34:19] of
[1:34:20] him the very everything that they needed
[1:34:23] they were afraid of realize that's the
[1:34:25] Devil he's trying to you there's
[1:34:27] something you need and the devil's
[1:34:29] trying to put scarecrows up there well
[1:34:30] you can't trust the preacher you can't
[1:34:32] trust the church you can't trust the
[1:34:33] message he's trying to put a scarecrow
[1:34:35] up there and the very thing that you
[1:34:37] need is the thing that you're scared of
[1:34:39] many people are scared of the move of
[1:34:40] the Holy Spirit and the very thing that
[1:34:42] they need is what they're afraid of very
[1:34:46] thing that they need when they saw him
[1:34:48] they said they thought it was a ghost
[1:34:49] and they cried out in fear right he said
[1:34:51] may I say this tonight in this great
[1:34:53] hour an atomic age when this world is in
[1:34:55] despair when nation is against nation
[1:34:57] and total Annihilation could come within
[1:34:59] 30 minutes to the world Jesus is coming
[1:35:02] walking along in this darkest ofour and
[1:35:04] the world's afraid of him they're saying
[1:35:06] it's holy rollers and fortun tellers
[1:35:08] everything else could be called he said
[1:35:09] I'm so glad in this Dark Hour Jesus is
[1:35:12] walking along with his church showing
[1:35:14] himself alive this is the darkest hour
[1:35:16] the world has ever seen since the dawn

[1:35:38] standing today it's never been so
[1:35:40] denominationally eat up it's never been
[1:35:42] so many differences so many Sensations
[1:35:44] but right in the midst of it all Jesus
[1:35:46] comes along in this darkest of the hour
[1:35:48] to show his and his love to the church
[1:35:51] yes the darkest of our then Jesus comes
[1:35:55] along Hallelujah verse 9 we are
[1:35:59] persecuted but not forsaken
[1:36:02] right Hallelujah we are pursued
[1:36:06] persecuted hard driven but not deserted
[1:36:09] to stand alone yeah I'm so thankful for
[1:36:13] that
[1:36:15] today listen he told the disciples when
[1:36:18] they were about to start getting really
[1:36:20] pers uted is about to come down on him
[1:36:23] he told him he said I'll pray the father
[1:36:25] he shall give you another comforter that
[1:36:27] he may abide with you forever yes even
[1:36:29] the spirit of Truth whom the world
[1:36:32] cannot receive because it seeth him not
[1:36:33] neither knoweth him but you know him for
[1:36:35] he dwelleth with you and shall be in you
[1:36:37] he said I will not leave you
[1:36:41] comfortless I will come to you that word
[1:36:44] comfortless is oranos it means I will
[1:36:47] not leave you as a as orphan
[1:36:49] children I will not leave you
[1:36:53] parentless I will not leave you
[1:36:55] fatherless that's been such a comfort to
[1:36:57] me over the years my father I had so
[1:37:00] many differences with my father and I
[1:37:01] had to come to a place where I forgave
[1:37:03] him and he forgave me I believe and we
[1:37:05] got to a place where we could we could
[1:37:06] spend time together and then he passed
[1:37:08] away and I got to a point where I
[1:37:10] thought what in the world why would God
[1:37:11] do that to me but he told me he said
[1:37:13] I'll give you father I'll give you
[1:37:14] mother I'll give you sister I'll give
[1:37:16] you brother he said and you'll never be
[1:37:18] without a
[1:37:19] father you'll never be orphanos you'll
[1:37:22] never be orphan or an orphan you'll
[1:37:24] never be parentless never comfortless
[1:37:27] never
[1:37:29] fatherless the last part of that verse
[1:37:31] cast down but not destroyed yeah we are
[1:37:36] struck down to the ground but never
[1:37:39] struck out and
[1:37:42] destroyed We Fall Down but we get back
[1:37:47] up I dare say there's not a Christian in
[1:37:49] here today even the best of us brother
[1:37:51] Danny we fall down we mess up we find
[1:37:55] ourselves faed down in the dirt
[1:37:57] sometimes but we get up over and over
[1:37:59] and over again why because the spirit of
[1:38:02] God calls us up oh come on we fall down
[1:38:06] yes we do we are cast down but we are
[1:38:08] not
[1:38:09] destroyed Hallelujah that's good brother
[1:38:12] Brandon said now we're not a perfect
[1:38:13] people we make our mistakes we do things
[1:38:15] that's wrong but you see love covers all
[1:38:17] of that we're willing when we see our
[1:38:20] mistakes to come back and apologize to
[1:38:22] one another he said yeah that's Warriors
[1:38:24] that's really men and women the gallent
[1:38:26] any man can go out to the battlefield
[1:38:28] that's got nerve enough to walk out
[1:38:29] there but when he gets knocked down then
[1:38:31] to get up and try it
[1:38:32] again Hallelujah in 2 Corinthians 4:10
[1:38:36] Paul says always bearing about in the
[1:38:39] body the dying of the Lord Jesus notice
[1:38:41] the contrast now as we're getting ready
[1:38:42] to close so he said we're we're knocked
[1:38:45] down but we're not knocked out we're
[1:38:47] persecuted but not destroyed we are we
[1:38:50] are uh we we are surrounded but not in
[1:38:53] despair
[1:38:54] yeah Paul says we have
[1:38:57] death but we have
[1:39:01] life the law of
[1:39:03] contrast so we have death this message
[1:39:07] is both death and life to
[1:39:08] us now think about it for a minute it's
[1:39:11] death to the world yeah death to our own
[1:39:15] ideas we always bear about in our body
[1:39:18] the dying of the Lord Jesus yes that's
[1:39:20] right and and that's a that dying that
[1:39:22] word is very uh in the Greek is is is
[1:39:25] very strong it's it's to continually die
[1:39:29] it's not being dead it's
[1:39:32] dying dying Paul said I Die daily yeah
[1:39:36] we are we bear in our body the dying of
[1:39:39] the Lord
[1:39:40] Jesus that the life of Jesus might be
[1:39:43] made manifest in our
[1:39:45] body Paul was knocked down but he got
[1:39:48] back
[1:39:49] up he was was knocked down on the road
[1:39:52] to emus he was or on the road rather to
[1:39:55] Damascus he was knocked down yes but he
[1:39:57] got back up yes John
[1:40:00] 5:24 he said verily verily I say un you
[1:40:03] he that heareth my word and believeth on
[1:40:04] him that sent me hath everlasting
[1:40:06] life it shall not come into condemnation
[1:40:10] but is passed from Death un
[1:40:12] life now look notice the contrast he's
[1:40:15] passed from what from Death To Life
[1:40:17] someone say it with me this morning from
[1:40:19] Death To Life yeah from Death that's a
[1:40:22] contrast Proverbs 18:21 now look
[1:40:26] death and life are where in the power of
[1:40:31] the tongue yeah yes sir that's
[1:40:33] interesting yes sir they that love it
[1:40:36] shall eat the fruit thereof Matthew
[1:40:38] 12:37 by thy words look at the contrast
[1:40:41] Thou shalt be
[1:40:42] justified by thy words thou shall be
[1:40:45] condemned yeah so Paul said I'm always
[1:40:48] bearing about in my body the dying of
[1:40:50] the Lord Jesus
[1:40:52] now
[1:40:53] watch oh my but when it come time to die
[1:40:59] physically Paul walks up to an
[1:41:01] Executioner's block come on knowing he's
[1:41:04] going to die come on he says oh death
[1:41:07] yes sir it's easy to do when you're just
[1:41:10] saying it you know but when you
[1:41:12] know knowing he had been sentenced to
[1:41:15] death listen what he says death and life
[1:41:19] are in the power of the tongue he said
[1:41:20] oh oh death yes sir amen oh we need to
[1:41:24] call it out today
[1:41:26] yes evil that is present with me trouble
[1:41:29] that is present with
[1:41:31] me where is your sting yes brother Brown
[1:41:35] said he knew that that bee of death lost
[1:41:38] its stinger on Calvary when it stung the
[1:41:41] Son of God oh my when it stung him it
[1:41:44] pulled out in could never sting
[1:41:47] again oh death what's Paul doing death
[1:41:50] and life life and the power of the
[1:41:51] tongue he's choosing
[1:41:54] life oh I hope you're here with me today
[1:41:56] no matter what you're going through
[1:41:58] choose life Speak Life yes I've been
[1:42:01] through trouble yes I've been
[1:42:02] discouraged yes i' I've I've been
[1:42:04] through hell and back but I believe I'm
[1:42:06] a Child of God I believe I'm a son or
[1:42:09] daughter of God I believe I'm going to
[1:42:11] go to the house of God I believe I'm
[1:42:12] going to worship I believe I'm a Child
[1:42:14] of
[1:42:16] God what was the difference in Saul and
[1:42:18] David look at the contrast Saul and it's
[1:42:20] coming to me now but Saul was a man who
[1:42:23] could not speak life right he he he he
[1:42:27] was a man who made mistakes less than
[1:42:29] what David made but he could not speak
[1:42:31] life yeah but David he cried out to God
[1:42:34] he said God forgive me wash me from my
[1:42:37] iniquities cleanse me from my sin Let me
[1:42:41] feel the presence of God again let me
[1:42:44] experience the joy of my salvation he
[1:42:46] could speak life
[1:42:49] good when need we need to teach our
[1:42:51] children the law of contrast brother
[1:42:54] brand said I noticed one time it was out
[1:42:56] when we was living on the farm under
[1:42:57] there was a hog under an apple tree them
[1:43:00] apples was falling off and hitting him
[1:43:01] on the head and he eat apples all day
[1:43:03] long and never did look up to see where
[1:43:04] they was coming from or kids need to
[1:43:07] look up sometimes see where their
[1:43:08] blessings are coming
[1:43:11] from that's right well that don't only
[1:43:13] go on Hogs he said you don't realize
[1:43:15] where that food comes from you better
[1:43:16] look up and thank God for it because he
[1:43:18] was the one who gave it
[1:43:21] he said ' we don't have no more security
[1:43:22] of the home send your children to school
[1:43:24] what do they teach them out there many
[1:43:25] times too many times they teach them we
[1:43:27] come from apes he said well we don't
[1:43:29] believe that now listen he's going
[1:43:31] somewhere he said if a man's no more
[1:43:33] than an animal then eat drink and be
[1:43:34] marry what makes so many juvenile
[1:43:36] delinquents that's what makes so many
[1:43:37] crimes committed because the people's no
[1:43:39] more than an animal it makes him act
[1:43:40] like an animal that's right he said we
[1:43:43] got to tell him sir yes sir are you
[1:43:46] hearing me this morning here's the
[1:43:47] contrast they go to school and they hear
[1:43:49] that they come from AES they go to their
[1:43:51] friends and they hear all kinds of
[1:43:52] nonsense they go out in the world when
[1:43:54] they get old enough to work and they're
[1:43:56] going to experience all kinds of stuff
[1:43:58] but remember we got to tell him there's
[1:44:00] something we got to tell him we got to
[1:44:02] tell him he's a Son of God born for the
[1:44:05] kingdom of God Peter you're a Son of God
[1:44:08] Amen whyatt Jason you're sons of God
[1:44:10] Theo you're sons of God you girls you're
[1:44:13] sons and your daughters of
[1:44:15] God you belong to God we got to tell him
[1:44:18] I got to tell him you got to tell him we
[1:44:20] got to tell him he's a Son of God born
[1:44:22] for the kingdom of God he is
[1:44:26] somebody glory to God he's not just an
[1:44:28] animal he's not just a per he is
[1:44:30] somebody this world wants to reduce you
[1:44:32] to an animal it wants to reduce you to
[1:44:34] just another person but the reason you
[1:44:36] said but I don't want to be different
[1:44:38] but the reason you're different it means
[1:44:39] you're special there's something about
[1:44:40] you that's different from the world
[1:44:42] because you are the
[1:44:45] contrast amen yes amen we got to tell
[1:44:49] him he's a son of God yeah born for the
[1:44:51] kingdom of God he is somebody this is
[1:44:53] just a negative a picture negative
[1:44:54] waiting for it to be developed some
[1:44:56] someday and death is the only thing that
[1:44:58] can develop it it takes a contrast of
[1:45:01] death to develop the picture to life
[1:45:03] when you die out to yourself a new
[1:45:04] picture starts on the inside that new
[1:45:06] creature Christ Jesus begin to show
[1:45:07] himself through one of these days he
[1:45:09] will come and receive you up to himself
[1:45:11] and the whole thing will be changed in
[1:45:12] this negative Shadow becomes a positive
[1:45:15] Jesus said except a corn of wheat fall
[1:45:16] on the ground and die it abideth alone
[1:45:18] but if it die it bringeth forth much
[1:45:19] fruit
[1:45:21] Luke 9:23 musicians go ahead and come
[1:45:24] Luke 9:23 he said to them all if any man
[1:45:28] sir will come after
[1:45:31] me Let Him Live that law of
[1:45:34] contrast let him deny
[1:45:37] himself take up his cross
[1:45:40] daily and follow
[1:45:42] me for whosoever will save his life yeah
[1:45:46] shall lose
[1:45:48] it see while I
[1:45:51] if I keep if I go to church I'll lose
[1:45:54] but if you try to save what you would
[1:45:55] lose by being in the house of God you'll
[1:45:58] lose it
[1:46:00] anyway right if you try to save what you
[1:46:03] would lose by being a Christian I'll
[1:46:06] lose my friends I'll lose my family you
[1:46:09] might but if you try to save it you'll
[1:46:11] lose it anyway amen this isn't all there
[1:46:14] is Jo is a small part of what there is
[1:46:18] this is time you can't measure time up
[1:46:21] against eternity it's such a great
[1:46:23] contrast we can't even understand
[1:46:26] it right I maybe that's what the
[1:46:28] Millennium is for it's just to show a
[1:46:29] contrast between a Thousand-Year
[1:46:31] Lifetime and a and a normal lifetime but
[1:46:34] then you contrast that with
[1:46:36] eternity right what how does that even
[1:46:39] how can you even comprehend
[1:46:41] that how can that even come into mind
[1:46:43] this is a smallest part don't live for
[1:46:45] this live for that
[1:46:49] yes won't be long you be just like me or
[1:46:53] you'll be just like Brother David or
[1:46:55] then you'll be just like brother Jeff
[1:46:59] brother

[1:47:02] Bill lives 20 more years he's just GNA
[1:47:04] keep getting older well till the Rapture

[1:47:30] contrast begins to show again in your
[1:47:32] life now I can

[1:47:37] means to be in the house of
[1:47:39] God I used to they had to drag me to
[1:47:41] church but now I appreciate yeah being
[1:47:44] in the presence of the almighty
[1:47:46] God why because I know what it's like to
[1:47:49] be a sinner yes but I know what it's
[1:47:52] like to have a savior am good whoever
[1:47:55] will save his life shall lose
