wings little [Music] e is that what we're going to do tonight just Mount up with Wings of Faith and just spread our wings and we don't have to worry about what it looks like down here because it's not going to be much longer we're going to leave here do you believe that amen if you would let's just bow our heads together for a moment if you have a special need on your heart tonight you'd like to make it known to the Lord just lift your hand to him heavenly father as we come once again to your throne Lord I'm asking that you would just touch these people tonight in a special way I pray Lord that you would move me out of the way and help me Lord just to be used of you this evening I pray Lord for each one that are sitting here Lord if there's healing that is needed Lord if it's salvation they need I pray they wouldn't go away wanting anything Lord but may they be filled tonight I pray for every young person in the building tonight I pray Lord that you would just heal Lord and Lord direct the words Lord that would be spoken tonight to a heart that would be open for you Lord those that couldn't come tonight I pray you would just go to where they are Lord just touch them Lord spiritual touch Lord or a healing touch whatever the need would be I pray Lord you would just come in a special way now and anoint Lord the hearers as well as my lips Lord don't let me speak anything that would not be like you I pray you would be with us now the remainder of the service in Jesus name amen how many's happy to be in the house of the Lord tonight and uh I just want to if you've got your Bibles go ahead and let's be tur to Revelations chapter uh three and we'll start with verse 15 Revelations 3 and 15 uh brother Ben had to go I think Brother David already mentioned it he was he's going to be speaking this weekend for brother Shawn Martin there in Virginia uh they're having a fall festival it's the time of year for fall festivals so he's out there for that and I'm sure he'll eat real good there and so we don't have to worry about brother Ben he'll be okay uh but he he is going to be gone for that over the weekend and I believe brother Stuart and myself supposed to cover Sunday so pray for us and I'm sorry you get stuck with me twice in the same week but I just pretend I'm Ben and we'll be okay oh my goodness y'all are going to be tough tonight aren't you going to be hard on me all right well we'll work with that I'll plow a little bit if I have to amen if you have your Bibles Revelations 3 and verse1 15 I Know Thy works that thou art neither cold or nor hot I would that thou were cold or hot so then because Thou Art lukewarm and neither cold nor hot I will spew thee out of my mouth because thou sayest I am rich and increased with goods and have need of nothing and knowest not that thou art wretched and miserable and poor blind and naked in verse 18 is where I want to take a text from tonight I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire that thou mayest be rich in white rment that thou mayest be clothed and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear and anoint thine eyes with isav how many wants that tonight that thou mayest see in verse 19 and as many as I love I rebuke and chasten be zealous therefore and repent verse 20 says behold I stand at the door and knock If any man hear my voice and open the door I will come in to him and will s with him and he with me and I like this verse to him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne even as I also overcame and am sat down with my father in his throne you may be seated may the Lord add the blessings to the word tonight and also just one verse of scripture over in First Peter uh chapter 1 1 Peter chapter 1 and verse 7 it says like this that the trial of your faith being much more precious than of gold that perisheth though it be tried with fire might be found unto praise and honor and Glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ so if I could just speak for a few moments on gold tried in the fire I would like to take here I know there's many uh different uh Bible characters we could take great heroes in the Bible you could take and there's many that would go through so many trials and we could just take them and just name them off but I think I think we need to make it personal tonight because every one of us here have to go through a trial can you sayen every one of us have got to come to a realization that nothing's going to be easy when you come to God there's no such thing as as an easy believism there's no such thing as you when you get to Christ everything's just hunky dory everything's great but really it's quite the opposite because when you come to Christ you've made a decision that is against Satan and his ways and all hell will break loose against you can you say Amen so I think what we need to know tonight is maybe that we're not looking for a smooth sailing uh flowery bed of ease but what we need to look at is if you're in the trial thank God for the trial if you're in the valley thank God for the valley because in the valley that's where we can grow in the valley that's where we can mature and become mature Christians so I think tonight maybe instead of trying to get everything to be easier in our lives and saying Lord I I want this to be easier I want this to be better maybe God is trying us and trying to get all the dross off of us so that we can actually become gold and so really what it is I would say it's character building because uh brother brandham would say like this I believe I've had the quote here brother brandham says now uh you could take nothing with you because you actually came to this world naked you came with nothing there was nothing that you were born with although some may have been born with an inheritance but you physically you personally you had nothing but what you're going to leave with he said would be nothing except there's one thing now brother brand said we will take our character and so if we're going to take that with us it's going to have to be a good character can you say amen I don't believe it's going to have a characterless church I don't believe he's going to have a people who who who just can't get along or a people that's going to be fussing and fighting no he wants to build our character and he wants us to be in the valley just long enough to where we can actually become the gold of God that he's wanting in this day can you say Amen so so what we have he said we better be real careful now to see that we take something that will make us right before God so so we'll have to go through things there may be a trial that you're facing that you don't you don't know why you're going through that trial but the very reason you could be going through that trial is so that you can face him and so that we can uh be ready for his appearing and his coming so I think let's just go a little farther into this brother brandom said what will we take with us he said we will take our character brother that is what we will take with us now what kind of character will you take with you will it be like his whose character was molded by suffering in the fiery furnace of affliction or will be will it be the softness of this characterless leosan people it is up to each one of us for in that day every man will bear his own burden now if you go back to the scriptures we just read in uh verse 17 of of Revelation chapter 3 in verse 17 you're going to see the condition that the that that the church world would be in they would they would have need of nothing they would be rich they would just be they would believe that they were the ones why because everything was going good for them they would have the finest churches maybe the big congregations but really that would not be the ones that he was coming for but they were blind because why they thought well this has got to be right because it's successful that's not always a sign it's right it it's not always a sign it's right because it's a it's the best preacher or it's the best church that's those are good things but that's not always a sign that that's of God's approval remember the sunshiny days and and the the good times are not always a sign that God's with you but really in the trial when you know the devil's after you that's a good sign that he's after you because he knows he don't have you so let's just go ahead and praise God in the bad times and I believe that there's a reason to worship when times are hard I think there's a reason for the church to to be happy when the when the days look gloomy why because we know that we know that we have not sold out to this leot of and age and we're not giving up and we're not giving in and we're not going to bow down but you can throw us in the fiery furnace and we're going to come out on the other side even if it I tell you what I think what we need to do is quit looking at the furnace and quit looking at the trial but look what's coming on the other side the promise is I will come up with them on the other side even if I have to face death on this side if they cut your head off or if if they if they throw you into the fiery furnace or if they put you in the denm with lions or whatever they might do to you remember we don't have to worry about that because we know who we have believed in and he is more than able to keep that which he has committed so what we'll say is this that God is not looking for a people who are wanting it easy he's never had a people who wanted it easy but he's always had a people that would be willing to fight when they had to fight can you say Amen so brother random said now every son every every child must be first child trained he said everyone not one exception every son he said he said have you went through trials have you went through tribulation have you suffered persecution then you are real children of God can what can you say Amen say thank God I've went through something I know I'm a Child of God because if it's easy remember that's a bad sign in this age if you're getting along with the world so well that everybody loves you everybody likes you that's probably not a good thing can you say Amen I'm not saying you don't don't get along with your co-workers and you don't get along with people you go to church with but what I'm trying to say is if you fit in with the world it's a sign you might need to start fitting in with God a little better and if you fit in with the world a little bit too close I think you might need to check your walk again with God and so we don't want to I'm not trying to say that everybody in the world's bad and everybody's going to hell no we there's going to be many of them saved and many go through the tribulation but I'm not talking to people going through the tribulation tonight I'm talking to a bride who is going to get herself dressed in these garments that he's talking about and it is a bride that is that is actually going to put on the isav so that they can see the word of God she's not going to run off from a hard sermon she's not going to backslide because the preacher preached a little hard one day she's not going to run away because she feels the heat of the devil coming at no she's not going to lay down when the going gets tough but she's going to stand and when you've done all you can to stand then stand therefore and brother Brandon would say it like this he said you've got to stand for something or you fall for anything you've got to stand for you've got to stand for your god-given rights because what you're doing is you're is you're constantly having to stand against sin and you're constantly having to stand against the the world and and and and listen the devil's after our young people Brother David the devil's after you and and the devil is after every one of us in this building and so if you if you know the devil's after you then you know it's not going to be easy you know there's going to be hard times coming but you know you're going to overcome why because to him that overcometh will I grant to sit in my Throne so I would say tonight if you know you're going to overcome at the end if you know you've read the back of the book and you know you're going to come out of winter I say quit worrying about what tomorrow holds Because You Know Who Holds Tomorrow oh come on somebody and say Amen tonight because God is not going to leave you comfor forless God is not going to leave you in this generation that is going away God is not looking at you like a of the like a bunch of perverts and and all these uh these people that are out here calling themselves Christians and and listen come on somebody I think you know that you're not part of that group and I know you may look a little odd and you may look a little crazy but you've been set aside for service you've been cleaned up you look different than the world you act different than the world you've been set aside why because you put eyes saav on and you can see the word and God has put you through some things or allowed you to go through some things so he can actually see his reflection in you and he can look look at you and say you're my bride you are Mrs Jesus Christ why because he can see himself in the very way that you live he can see himself in the way that you act he can see himself in the character that you possess can you say amen amen so we're not looking for we're not looking to fit in can you say Amen we're not looking to be we're not looking to uh fit in with a certain party of politics although I think everybody knows there's probably one that may be worse than the other and and I would say that maybe we're not trying to fit in with this group over here here because listen every bit of this is going to burn everything we've got's Going Up in Smoke we we ain't going to save nobody if they're not looking for this salvation message we we can't save people who don't want it we can't make people bride who are not predestinated to be bride but what we can do is preach the truth and and the seed will come to life if there is a seed there can you say Amen we but we don't make anybody anything so you can come to church every service and if the word doesn't Quicken something in your heart then then maybe there's nothing there but let me go ahead and tell you something the fact that you're here tells me there is something there so let the word go to work on your heart let the word go to work on that seed that's inside of you let the word Quicken you so that you don't have to go down with the world but you can go up with him can you say Amen so brother Brandon goes on like this and I've read this quote before and maybe I like it a little too much but he said I think we ministers making a little too much flowers for the convert he said oh come to Christ and everything is lovely but you see it isn't like that he said in the way that everything is flowery but of ease because no Christian can all he said all that live Godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecutions and he said so if you're not suffering persecution for Christ's sake then there's something wrong can you say man if the devil ain't after you he's got you he said that's all because as long as he's after you that's a sign he hasn't got you yet but if he isn't after you it's a sign he has got you he said so just remember as long as he's blasting at you you're just a few jumps ahead of him and he said just keep on going oh I think that's what we need to do tonight just keep on going sister Janie because when the devil's on your heels He Ain't Got You Yet when you can feel the breath of the devil remember he still ain't got you yet and I don't believe you have to worry about nothing because he has went before you in battle he has already fought the War for you and you don't have to do nothing but just get in Christ and you are safe can you say amen he said but all that live Godly in Christ will be they will suffer persecutions he said rejoice and be exceedingly glad for so persecuted they the prophets which was before you he said don't go with a hang down face and say well I oughtn't have done it I guess I I just can't stand I just can't stand for somebody to talk about me and say I'm old fashioned I'm this that or the other he said oh you should be exceedingly glad somebody say I'm exceedingly glad if you're exceedingly glad and happy because of it you can bear the reproach of his name and by keeping his commandment it caused you to do that so brother Brandon preaches that in forsaking all 1962 and sometimes that's just what we got to do if it's a friend that's pulling you back out into the world sometimes we just need a to cut that friend off and say I love you but I can't go that way I'm praying for you but I can't go that way sometimes if you get out here in these worldly churches and well brother brand told us to get away from them denominational walls didn't he there's a reason for that because you get in there and you get comfortable in a system and you you you set there and they might have the finest music and they might have the finest preachers and they've been through uh a seminary and and all these things but the end there of is the way of death remember there's more than one way that you can go as a Christian but there's only one way that leads to righteousness there's only one way that leads to truth and so tonight I'm not saying let's go the easy way and I know it's hard to preach when when you're preaching and you want to make everybody happy and you say well we got to preach it hard sometimes listen that's not because you're you're unloved that's because God does love you and he wants you to he wants you to be right there with him on that day he doesn't want to leave one behind so sometimes when your edges are getting a little rough sometimes God's going to send a man to you that he can preach to you write down your problem and go ahead and call all Sin Sin and black black and white white why because God cares for you just like that if he didn't love you he would never correct you but because he loves you Brother David he corrects us because he loves us he sends somebody to preach the word to us he didn't choose the Sun or the moon to preach the gospel but he chose imperfect men who could stand here and maybe they can't be perfect in your eyes or maybe they're maybe there's going to be a little problem you and you say well I've got a complex against that man because you know he's done this or he's done that and I'll say this if the man's preaching the word of God get behind the man because there's not many left that's preaching the word in this day but I'll say it like this I think we need to get more men in the Pulpit that'll preach this gospel I think there needs to be more men standing behind this Pulpit I don't care about their style points for how good they can preach or how bad they preach but I'll tell you this preach the word of God and let it change hearts and the people preach the word and let the young people come back to God preach the word and let the old people come back to God preach the word and let a Revival start in Hardy Arkansas again we don't have to worry about what anybody says about us because it's God's approval that matters to us and God did not put us here just to be another church he didn't put us here just to be another group of people that would gather on a Wednesday night but he put us here to be a people that would overcome so that we could sit with him can you say Amen brother Bram tells this story about The Lily he said you ever notice a lily where it comes from he said ride out of the bottom of the slimy pit of the pond and it toils day and night to get it itself to the light but once it gets to the light and it blooms out and the most beautiful flower there is anywhere that's what a lily is he said it comes from the dirt it comes from nothing it comes through the mud Brother David you may not be able to look back and say I'm proud of my family but you can say you know what I'm proud for what God did for me no matter where I came from it don't matter that I come from the mud Look at me now God has set me aside and cleaned me up and set me in this great Army I'm one of his it don't matter what nobody says about you it don't matter what the the devil tries to haunt you with it well come on somebody it don't matter where you came from I don't care how good your family is or how bad your family is everyone of you have got to come through some dirt and come through something so that you can become the Lily that God sees well and many times you look in the in the valley and you see the Lily growing in the valley and you say what are you doing down here well if Mr Lily could talk he would probably tell you well I'd like to be up on the mountain but lies don't grow up there well come on somebody lies don't grow on top of the mountain but they grow in the valley where things get tough and you know you might have a mountain ahead of you but right there in that Valley where you are that's where you can bloom that's where God's going to make gold out of you can you say Amen so God's not going to put you in a place that would not cause you to become gold God's not going to put you in a place that would that would leave the dross on you if we can put it that way because until gold is beat it just looks dirty it looks it looks bad it looks it has no form it has no shape And you can't see your reflection in that gold God may look there may be somebody walking down the street that is gold of God and God may be looking at that person knowing that they're gold but he cannot see his reflection or his character in that person why because they haven't been put through anything yet they haven't withstood a test yet but see you here tonight that have been through test after test and trial after trial what it is it's the Goldsmith standing there and he's beating all the drw off of you he's beating out the temper he's beating out the indifference he's beating out the anger and the hatred and he's beating out all the the the indifference of the of the world and he's trying to beat the world out of you well come on somebody I I I think we just need to look at it like this if God's pushing me through this trial or helping me through this trial thank God for the trial because I know that I want to reflect him and most of all it doesn't matter how I feel but how does he feel about me does God want me to go through this trial then I'll go through it exceedingly glad it's harder in the trial to be exceedingly glad but if you know what's on the other side it's pretty easy well can you say Amen it's pretty easy if you realize that on the other side of this trial is Victory everybody loves Victory can you say Amen everybody loves a good victory dance everybody loves a good service but sometimes you got to be child trained a few times to get to the good service sometimes you got to get rid of the bad attitudes to get to the good service sometimes you got to get rid of the well can you say Amen sometimes you've got to get put through some things so that you can actually break through and have a good old time in the Holy Ghost in church again why because you've you you you've lost your first love you've turned back and you've looked at the world again but I say if you're looking at the message of the hour and if you're looking at the things of God and if your heart is stayed on him then God wants to do more for you than you could even think possible God wants to clean you up sister Stephanie God wanted to turn you around he knew that when you were out there and you were still gold but God didn't see his reflection he knew that if he'd put you through some things that you'd be sitting right here in the house of God tonight why because God knew what you needed to be where you are tonight Brother David God knew what you had to go through as a little boy to be where you are tonight God knew what I had to go through to be standing here tonight I didn't like it all the time but God knew best for me and if he loves you he has chastised you but don't think God's mad at you he loves you he wants to change you from what you are to what you're going to be you may be in the valley here tonight but remember you're going to bloom into a lily you may be in the you may be in the trial of your life brother the Danny but God has got Victory waiting for you God has got something waiting for well come on somebody I know it's Wednesday night but I want to tell you tonight you don't have to hang your head down at work tomorrow you don't have to go around to school tomorrow and say well I'm just oldfashioned or I'm just different no you can hold your head up high I'm the gold of God God may be testing me with that friend God may be testing me with that coworker but God has got something on the other side of the test for you can you say Amen brother Bon said I'm a prospector what does a prospector do he hunts for gold well he was traveling this world seven times over what was he doing he was looking for gold he wasn't looking for just he wasn't looking for for fool's gold the people that wanted to jump around and say well I I want to follow you for the gift or I want to no he wanted somebody that would grab a hold of that third pole word and be changed by it we're not looking for a group of people to say I want to follow you for the good times no I'm with this message in the good times in the bad times I don't care who walks away from this message I don't care who falls away from this message I am in it for the long haul why because it's not me that's holding on he's holding me can you say Amen when he was hunting for gold I'm glad he found me aren't you glad Brother David he found you I tell you what I think we ought to be thankful that we're just able to be here you say are we able why are we here because God saw fit that you could be here tonight God saw you in your condition God saw you how low down well I'll just say it for me God saw me how low down I I was he saw when I had a temper I couldn't fight he saw how bad I was that I just couldn't live it anymore but he knew that that trial would make me stronger today than I was then he knew that I had to overcome something so that I could stand now he knew that false Doctrine had to creep up around me so that I could stand for something and break out of that wall so that I wouldn't be well come on somebody I could stand for something true now because I was looking around and I realized you know what this ain't right because I'm willing to stay with what a prophet said I don't care who says something different I don't well come on somebody I don't care what prophet says something different I don't care what church says something different but if the message of the hour it's either my Absolut or it's not my absolute so why don't we just hold on to the absolute you can't have two absolutes in a ball game did you know know that you can't have two absolutes because you might have if you've got a if you got a plate umpire I don't know nothing about baseball but here we go you got a plate umpire if you got two guys standing there you might get one that calls it a strike and one calls it a ball but let me tell you something if you got one man standing there he's right regardless right whether you want him to be or not he's right regardless so what I'm saying is this we've got one absolute tonight can you say Amen we've got one thing that we can hold to and that is the word that is the message of the hour that is what we're holding to it's not men's opinion it's not my opinion it's it's not me that's going to help you overcome other than what God would use me for it it's not me that can help you it's not me that can save you it's not me that can preach the fire baptism of the Holy Ghost down no but God can use a vessel to preach to you and then out of that vessel he can cause things to change in your life I say I'm thankful for the ministry we have today I'm thankful that God would send us men who are not afraid to stand here here and call things as though they were and preach the word without compromise I'm thankful for men of God that'll do that I tell you what it ain't popular but it don't matter if it's popular it's a god-given right for a man of God to stand in the pulpit and preach the word of God to the people and the people can be fed by it lives can be changed by it testimonies can come from it that's what we need is men with a backbone back in the Pulpit Brother David men that'll stand here and say Well it may not it may hurt some feelings tonight but God knows the end of that God knew what you needed listen I believe God knows every time you come to church he's going to have exactly what you need in that service right whether you think so we not well can you say Amen you're not born looking like gold all the time gold a prospector might be able to tell your gold because he's been around it a while but you're not looking very pretty you ever watch a western movie where they're mining I they're black and white usually so I can't tell what's dirt and what's gold when they look at well we got a strike well what what strike looks like a cave to me and if I come across gold in the wild I wouldn't know what it was because I've never had any in person so so so what it is is but God saw you in the dirt with God I wish somebody I wish somebody just go ahead and just let loose tonight a little bit I won't hold you long when my watch tells me to quit I'll quit is but what we need to do you know we come to church can I talk to you for a minute it is that okay all right here we go I think sometimes we come to church and we've had a bad day and we bring our bad day to the house of God and we think everybody else needs to have a bad day because we had a bad day I've done this so I'm guilty I've done it I'm I'm I'm standing here confessing confession is good for the soul but Brother David we've had a bad day we had you know an argument or something maybe with a coworker or or maybe we just messed up on the job and now we're feeling down maybe we didn't do anything bad but we just feel bad we just had a bad day brother Joe one of them corpses talk back to you just a bad day but then you come to the house of God and you try to hold on to that burden you know if you'd ever just learned to cast that thing off of you and put it on him yes sir he's willing to take every one of your burdens sir and then you can actually have fun in the house of God again you can actually have a good time in church again but what we're doing is we're trying to carry the load when he's already carried the load for us we're trying to carry all these burdens when we don't need to carry no burdens because he went to Calvary with every one of our burdens on his back why would we carry burdens Brother David why would we come to church with a with a mad face why would we come to church with a frown on our face when God has brought us here to sit together in Heavenly places God has brought us here he thought enough of us to set us here tonight God thought so much of us brother Danny that he would not leave us down here in a barroom he would not leave us out here with the world wondering what purpose do I have in life but he gave me purpose when he gave me the message of the hour he gave me purpose when he gave me friends and and and Believers in the church that I could fellowship with why because we have something in common we may not be exactly alike we may not be we may not see everything alike but what we can do is we can Fellowship around an absolute that is what we can hold to we can say it doesn't matter what my differences is because I am not one of them that's going to sit here and pick apart what you do and you're not going to pick apart what I do we're going to love one another why because because we are we are we are put eyes have on and we don't see you Danny Ward as just a man anymore but I see you as a brother in Christ and I see was an elder in the gospel I don't see brother Jeff as just another man that's out here in the world but I see him as the gold of God why because the IAB is on and I've seen men and women who are dressing themselves in the Garment of Praise and they're dressing themselves in the Garment of righteousness why it's not something we could do but we have taken on the message of the hour we have the blood cover our sins we let the blood cover the mistakes between us and we start looking at people different and that's just the truth of it if you're looking at everybody's mistakes I think it's time that you start looking at your own because you'll find that you've made just as many as anybody else can you say Amen let me get off of that and get right back to where my notes are he said at the beginning you are born defeated a't that just that's just shouting worthy right there brother Danny we're just born defeated brother Harvey we're we're born no good and that don't give us much hope he said and that birth can never bring you to life because you're born defeated and you're in a defeated World amongst defeated people amongst defeated Creeds defeated denominations you've got to come to Victory some way can you say Amen am it's just like a Lily and he talks about this Lily multiple quotes and I left this one in here because I really like this quote he said just like a lily he said one of the prettiest flowers there is I'm very fond of those great caes and pawn lies I think there's nothing hardly as pretty as a great big Pawn Lily call it water lily how it's Radiance he said now where does it come from it's a little seed down in the bottom of a Muddy Pond and that little seed yet all the radiance that'll ever shine in it is in it right then so in your lowest state all that you would ever become was already there oh can somebody say Amen so when you were born when you when you were born defeated there was something on the inside that knew no defeat yes sir and so when you were born in the mud there was something on the inside that already knew that it needed to see the light and there was already something on the inside that would become beautiful in the eyes of God but it was just a process and a test that I had to go through are you still with me I I've got 10 minutes left is that okay all right and that little seed he said yet all the radiance that'll ever shine in it is right thin when it's in that mud but it has to strive daily knowing that there is something it's black it's dirty it's Mucky it's slimy it's in that slime it's living in yet it presses its way through the mud and and the muck and the waters and the stagnant places until it sticks its head above in the light and expresses what's been hid in it all the time so when you are in that condition sister Stephanie in you all the time was the potentials of what we're seeing now in you all oh come on somebody sister Sandra through every trial you've been through that was just the gold becoming brighter in the eyes of God that was just the that was just the dross getting beat off of you it was times you didn't think you could take it no more but God knew you could stand the test and so he brought you through on the other side as pure gold I say tonight quit looking at the trial quit looking at the test quit looking at the seed and saying well they're nothing they can never become nothing God knows that the trial they're going through is going to bring them forth as pure gold can you say Amen sir he said so there's something about it he said in the waters and the stagnant places and and it sticks its head above in the light and expresses what it's been hidden all the time listen that ought to give somebody reason to shout even if you're looking at your neighbor tonight and you're saying well they don't look like they're gold but in the eyes of God they're Priceless in the eyes of God they're worth more they're more precious than fine rubies they're more precious than gold why even the test you went through was more precious than gold but God brought you out on the other side I say he's God and he's worthy of all of our praise tonight can you say Amen brother bam said I think that's an overcomer once in sin once did things wrong anybody ever been there anybody besides me ever been there anybody ever been in sin anybody ever did anything wrong well okay a few of us have done some good some bad things the good ones I'm going to talk to you after church because I want to know how you did it if if you've never done anything wrong that's wonderful but I'm going to tell you tonight if you're a son and daughter of God you've been through some things you've done some things wrong you've done some things you're not proud of you've done some things that that maybe maybe look like well God cannot even be saved but God knew you could be brought through that situation because he wanted you to come forth as pure gold can you say amen he said what is it he said don't worry about it now oh can somebody say Amen to that he said I he said I did what things that was wrong he said don't worry about it now once did things that was wrong then now why look back in the pond again see why look back to that dirt again why go back to where you came from when you're now Sons and Daughters of God seated together in Heavenly places worshiping God in the freedom that you have why go back to the life of condemnation why go back to the life that's going to hold you from your praise why don't we just worship God because we know where we came from but we ain't going back for nobody we ain't giving up for nobody we're not going to turn around and look back and say well maybe that was fun maybe I should go back no we are going all the way and the gold is just going to get cleaner and better all the way and all the time because every time we go through a test God is trying Us in the fire amen but we will come forth as pure gold can you say amen Amen brother R says it like this my goodness he said my God is able to heal me from this or my God's able to make me this or the other he says in quote God's able to take me from this wheelchair my God's able to do this I've accepted him as my healer I've confess I've confessed my sins and confessed that I believe that he is my healer let come let go what may if not well today I will be tomorrow that's Abraham's children right there if I'm not tomorrow I will be next year the lord gave and the Lord takes away blessed be the name of the Lord he said oh there it was and when they walked into the fiery furnace now I think we know this story well enough to know of the outcome of this but he said when they walked into the fiery furnace under trial under a test they held true to the end can you say Amen but God was there just in the spare of a moment and he delivered them and they knowed that they were prayed up their sins were confessed they know that they had met every requirement and yet he seemed to be silent and I like this part and I think I've used this one before as well but he said he's only silent to test you God is never that far away brother Brandon would say he's as close as your right arm to you God is never that far away he's just a Whisperer away he's just a breath away he's just an Arms Reach away why because he knows when you've had enough that he can step into the fight he knows when you can't take the heat no longer he'll be the fourth man in the fire remember when you're going through a test and trial you're not in it alone but God will bring you through it you think you're in it alone and all the time there's a silent partner standing there that's got the keys to death Hell In The Grave he's a oh come on somebody he may be silent Brother David it but when he when he speaks all Heaven and Earth would shake when he speaks hell had to let loose of its doors and when when he speaks the Devil Himself had to shut up and be quiet can you say Amen so he may be silent but that's only to test you brother BR would say that he said to see really what you are what's on the inside of you if you really mean from your heart he said Daniel was tested for the worship of one true God he was tested for that and in the time of test he stood the test and what did God do after it looked like the chips were down for him as we would say and that they didn't know what to do they was going to feed him to the lion but Daniel stayed true to the test and there is one true God and he possessed the Gate of his enemy God had closed the mouth of the lion see we possessing the gates after trial brother B would preach a sermon called that we possess the gates of the enemy after trial we can take those Gates Samson could take those gates after a trial he could he could he could push those pillars down after the trial of a time you may have to go through something that looks like it's going to kill you but God is only letting you go through that to bring you out on the other side more Victorious than you went in greater than you went in because greater is he that is in you can you say Amen than he that is in the world I just want to read a couple more here and I'll try to close very quickly he said now Moses didn't throw up his hands and say well I guess it's all wrong he stayed there and waited on God he stayed true no matter how many impersonators there was he stayed true and when he stayed true to his commission to bring those people out of that place when the water gate got in his way God let him possess it and he opened the gate by the pillar of fire that was leading him he took the people on to the promised land now it looks like Moses might have been a nobody but let me just go ahead and tell you something the nobodies is whose God's going to use can you say Amen it may look like a little church over here on the side with 30 40 people 50 people on the Wednesday night but let me just go ahead and tell you something greater is he that's in one of you than he that's in the world so I said we've got a legion of armies of gods right here we've got a legion of angels around us there are angels lining the rose tonight that won't let one thing happen to you until it's time for something to happen to you we don't fear death what can you say man we don't fear the test We Don't Fear the trial we don't fear Temptation because all those things are going to come to a Believer but we are more than able to overcome them we have something greater on the inside of us than what the world's got to try to take us out can you say Amen brother R would say like this he said Joshua he said two of them went to the promised land remember there was 12 that went in yeah 12 that went over and he said 10 of them come back scared to death 10 of them said we can't do it 10 of them said we're not able there was only two of them that said we're more than able Joshua would steal the people and say listen don't worry about the Giants that's just a test well come on somebody God told us he was going to give us the land quit looking at the giant I I preached to here not long ago about David and Goliath name that name that giant and take him out and cut his head off what are we doing we're getting scared of the very thing that God is letting us go through for a test but God has already fought the Battle he's already fought the victory you are going to go through it but God has already put you on the winning side as brother Ben said several times he's already rigged it in your favor he's already brought you through it in the mind of God he already sees you as pure gold that's already formed in His image but he's got to let you come through things so that you can become what he's already seen you are seen you as in the in in the mind of God you can do no wrong right think about it if you've already if you're already going to be there he's already got your house built he's already got everything he's got your name on it he's even got your name on his refrigerator he's got your picture there if you're better looking than me but he's got a listen he's got a he's got a house with your name and addess on it and and you think God is going to stand here and say I'm going to cast this one out now because because I brought him through this but he's just not doing well no God already knew he going to come through that trial God already knew you was going to make it you are going to make it quit worrying about the future know that God's got it all in control can you say Amen sir so 10 of them said it's too much of a job we just couldn't do it well then people we look like grasshoppers by the side of them but what did Joshua do he stealed the people he said wait a minute we are more than able to take it no matter how little we are or how much in the minority what what was he doing he was standing true to the promise now I want to say tonight you've been given a promise of a Rapture you've been given a promise of overcoming and he said to them that overcome will I grant to sit with me in my Throne so I would just go ahead and say it like this if you know you're going to make it quit worrying about it if you know you're going to make it quit coming to church with well I hope I can say this and get away with it but quit coming to church with a bad mood why because you know that this is just a test rejoice in your trial because God wants you to come forth as a lily God wants you to be coming forth where he can see his reflection in you so the test you're going through is the time to Rejoice amen amen well that's a bad way to look at it oh my goodness it says I'm done I'm almost done but what did Joshua do he stealed the people and said wait a minute we're more than able how many's more than able here tonight quit looking at your own self and say he has made me more than able we are more than able to take it no matter how little we are or how much in the minority what was he doing he was standing true to the promise I give you this land so tonight he said I give you your house I give you your children I give you your inheritance you might go through test after test you might look at them kids and say my God what are you doing but all he's doing is letting them kids go through something because they've got to come to the same place you are he's letting them kid I tell you what I don't think it's just our children what about our brother Brothers what about our sisters what about our if maybe some of you kids your parents need to go through something well can you say Amen some of them like I wish they would but listen I think what we need to know tonight is the trial is not there to kill us the trial is not there to take us out but the trial is just there it's just a stepping stone of God's grace it's all Grace the trial is Grace to You well can you say man the trial the test is just grace to you because though God would slay me yet I'll trust him and if you have that kind of Faith then we can look at every obstacle and say I don't know how I'm getting through it but I do know that he's more than able I don't know how we're going to take this land but he's more than able I don't know in myself how to do anything I don't know how to stand here and preach the gospel but he's more than able to speak through a human lips and speak right to your need tonight he's more than able he is God can you say amen he said I God and I change not I say that if he was God yesterday if if he brought the Hebrew children through a fire then he can bring you through the fire if he brought Moses across the Red Sea he can bring you across the Red Sea and I think just like then you can look at it and say you know what that was just God all the time I say tonight it's just God in the test it's God in the trial it's god making gold in your life can you say Amen as the musicians would come my time's up but I want to just say this just a couple things here before we close brother Bram said do you believe that he's talking to this lady in the prayer line he said do you believe that mother God has given you your healing but you'll fight every inch of it can you say amen he said everywhere The Souls of your feet sets that I give you for POS that I give you for possession Footprints means possession it's all yours every promise belongs to you but you'll fight every inch of the way now he says so I wonder if we could stand together tonight I hope this was okay I wasn't trying to hold you long and I might have went a little over but I just want to say tonight that let's quit worrying about the test and just remember that he's got it all in control he's got every situation in your life already figured out and we don't actually have to figure it out we just have to participate in the plan of God can you say Amen many times we can look around and you can see my job's not working out and my family's not working out and maybe your marriage ain't working out but God's got it all in control and there's no reason to give up on God now can you say man there's no reason to give up now God is more than able he's more than enough he's he can supply all of your needs he's still Jehovah Gyra can you say Amen he's still Jehovah Rafa he is still Jehovah of the old and that was Jesus of the new he's just God all the time and God is not willing that any should perish but that all would come to repentance listen I say if there's one of you tonight that needs something from God you say well the the the burden's getting a little heavy and I say give it to Jesus tonight can you do it I wonder if we could bow our heads and just just go to him to the tonight you say well I just need I just need something I just need a touch I just need a little more help because this trial is getting to me and maybe I maybe I don't I don't know if I can handle it much longer listen just right there in the nick of time you might have to go in the fire but he's there waiting for you in the fire if you have a need on your heart tonight I just wonder if you'd put your hand up to him and say Lord I just need more of you tonight I just need a little bit more of your grace to make it through this test I just need a little bit more I know I know that you're working all things for my good do you believe that church all things you don't know what I've been through all things all things it don't matter how bad the life has been that you've been dealt it don't matter how bad it looks like it's been stacked against you but remember all things work together in your situation for your good because you love God and because he loves you he allows trials to come so that you could become his image we are his body on earth and the only way to become that is by being tested like he was tested tried like he was tested tried like he was tried so I wonder as we're just with our heads bowed just for a moment if we could just talk to him in your own way say thank you Lord for the test because I know that it's for my good thank you for the trial I'm in it may not be easy but he's got it all in control I wonder with your heads bow if we could just sing this for a moment oh you are more than you are more [Music] than you are more more than enough if you believe it could you put your hand up to it for me Jehovah Gyra now je gy you're my provider you are more more than enough for me Jehova [Laughter] Raa You're My Healer and by your stri Liv I am set
