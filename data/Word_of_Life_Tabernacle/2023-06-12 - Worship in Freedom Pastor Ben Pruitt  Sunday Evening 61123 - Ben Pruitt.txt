with me to Psalm 51 12. Psalm 51 12. we'll just read this one verse and I'll let you be seated says restore unto me the joy of thy salvation and uphold me with thy free spirit I want to speak to you on freedom in worship freedom and worship let's bow our heads together for a word of prayer Heavenly Father we're so grateful to be at your house again tonight Lord also to be your house Lord we're so thankful that you are the same yesterday today and forever you don't change oh God we're thankful for that Lord I pray that you would just move over this audience tonight Lord these people that are here order more than an audience we're a congregation Lord we're Believers Lord and we're we're pulling together we're believing together Lord that the sick will be healed and and the blind eyes will open and those who have spiritual problems or those problems can their questions can be answered and the problems can be fixed or we we believe you're that kind of a god tonight and I pray God that you'd move aside the tiredness and whatever else it is that we feel and that we would we would press forward oh God into your presence tonight hear your word Lord and Feast on the things of God for you granted now heal every sick person touch everyone we pray in Jesus name amen God bless you you can be seated in this country we know we have freedom to worship but I wonder how often that we worship in Freedom because it's a different thing we have freedom to worship and I thank God for that we shouldn't take that for granted because men have died so that we could have freedom to worship God and and and we we are glad of that I I've been in countries where they don't have the freedoms that we do and I thank God for what we have and I've been in places where they use some emergency or something to to quieten the people and we've preached in places where it was dangerous to your health to stand and preach the gospel we we've stood there and done that when they had guards outside the building with shotguns waiting because somebody might come and blow the place up we've got freedom to worship and we ought to take advantage of that because it's a rare condition listen to me tonight it's a rare condition freedom of worship is not found in many places in the world in fact it was a completely novel idea when it was presented here there's very few places in the world that have what we have even our our neighbors in Canada and our in our people over in Great Britain they don't have the freedoms that we do to be able to preach the word but I'm so glad I can preach it like it says it aren't you glad of that because we we can we can hear it still and we can still believe it and we can still congregate together and it means something to have freedom of worship but historically people have not had that but what they what that's have been reserved for the nobility it's been reserved for people of noble birth yeah are you with me tonight that historically that's what it's been reserved for freedom of worship for me to really be free to be able to choose where I wanted to go to church and what I wanted to do in church was dependent on me being of noble birth because if I was a person that just the Mir the many slaves and servants and and and all the people that were under the king or under the Nobles those people didn't have rights to be able to worship how they felt that's why this nation was founded so now but now we have freedom of worship but we do do we have freedom in worship restore to me the joy of your salvation and the Amplified version It's restored to me the joy of your salvation and uphold me with a willing Spirit great and that's the way most uh translations translate this is willing willing Spirit a free spirit a willing spirit that word means voluntary generous magnanimous he said a free liberal things a noble a prince willing to be willing yeah so a noble person you know to be nobility in olden times it was more than just being born a noble person but you were considered to have a noble attitude and so because you are given great things and you were born great that you were you were you were expected to be generous you were expected to be giving you were expected to be free with your time and your money because you were given great things and so the nobility was expected to be that way and so here here is King David crying out to God after he's committed a great room and he's crying out to God he said God restored to me the joy of your salvation and sustain me or uphold me with a willing spirit give me back my nobility oh I hope you understand you realize this country is a genius of this country is that it made us all Nobles right we have freedoms every one of us have rights people in other countries many of them did not have rights but we have rights and here he's saying restored to me restore to me that willing spirit that Noble spirit that one who would willingly give himself forgive his worship to God let me be someone who's willing to worship oh is that your prayer tonight let me be somebody who's willing let it restore to me the nobility of spirit and a thought and sin destroys that now brother Branham teaches us to speak of willingness he said the entire Bible is set up on Revelation he said you'll never know the Bible just by cold-hearted reading it you've got to read the Bible in the spirit you've got to be in the mood of reading you've got to love to read it and the Bible is written so that the wise smart educated will never understand it Jesus thanked God and said father I thank thee that thou has hid these things from the wise and prudent and will reveal them to babes such as we'll learn he said oh I'm so glad of that you don't have to be somebody in this world to know God aren't you glad of that you don't have to be a king or a noble according to this world to know God he said you have to have a willing heart and God will go to dealing with that willing heart if you are willing you see people that are restricted in their worship many times it's because the heart is not willing so David recognizing where that comes from he says restored to me a willing heart Hallelujah a noble again how to out of Freedom a prince out of Freedom the average person did not have we are the nobility of God how many believe that tonight we're his Kings and Priests the Bible said he has made us unto our God Kings and Priests and we shall reign on the Earth in Hebrews 13 15 by him therefore let us offer sacrifices the sacrifice of praise to God continually the fruit of our lips giving thanks to his name first Peter 2 5 you also as living stones are built up a spiritual house and a holy priesthood offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God by Jesus Christ so your nobility today tell us in the story about the man who come back from Africa and the slave and he come from Africa and here he was in the same condition as all the other slaves he had that he is at the same place and was whipped by the same task Masters he was in the same condition but he had a noble spirit yeah he had a noble spirit and and he was offering he he he acted in a certain way because that's the way the son of a king would act in Africa he was the son of a king don't you realize that's what we are today and there ought to be a willingness among Sons and Daughters of the king is anybody hearing me on a Sunday afternoon there ought to be a willingness among Sons and Daughters of the king to worship God with all of our hearts yes sir good my brother Ben I'm tired I am too but I believe our our God is Worthy yesterday and forever I believe I'm at least worthy of my praise today and I want to be Noble in my giving I want to I want to have that nobility that willingness about me that freedom now brother random he tells that story he said brother if we're living in the end time we're an alien that that boy was an alien that come back from Africa that man that comes from Africa he was an alien he said brother if we're living in the end time we're alien here to this formalism we are aliens to formalism and let me repeat that we're Alias to formalism and all kinds of things that's in the world we're in a world slavery and darkness he said the Christian church should conduct itself like real genuine born-again Sons and Daughters of God we should have that characteristic about us for our father is the king of glory and we are his subjects though we are in a sinful world he is the king of glory so David said restore unto me that sense of nobility Give Me Freedom Hallelujah so we have freedom so he tells us we have freedom from formalism what is formalism formalism is someone else's mode of worship other than the Kings right we have a king and we are Kings and Priests so whenever you hear someone talk about formalism formalism is someone else's mode of worship formalism could be uh could be Pentecostal it could be Baptist it could be Methodist but it's another form of worship other than the freedom of serving Christ see you don't have to take my form of worship I don't have to take your form of worship but you serve the king yourself you're a king you're a priest you offer to God a spiritual sacrifice so you don't have to copy somebody else's form of worship Hallelujah aren't you glad for that today brother Brown said say I feel religious I really do he said I feel like I can shout now he said when a Baptist goes to shouting it's really something see he had a Baptist formalism yes but when oh my when he realized who he was when he come out from those walls he got out of that formalism and he began to just serve God that's what we want I don't want to press people to do something they're not comfortable doing I don't want to work people up I don't want to do any of that but I want to serve God under the freedom of the spirit of God let me be free to worship God in my own way let me have freedom in worship hey man so when a Baptist goes to shouting he said it's really something oh my it's wonderful to serve the Lord and know it's thus saith the Lord he said it takes all the scarecrows out and the Spooks out and puts the holy spirit in there and lives with you with the dove of meekness and quietness Eternal hope in your heart how many have that today takes all the guests out all the Hocus Pocus sound all the formalism out of your heart puts a real no-sew in there and a faith that's Everlasting true oh my now what we want this afternoon brother Branham warned the people against formalism in whatever form that it takes he said he'll come in judgment upon the Nations he said while he's been revealed in Mercy oh hurry ye hither run quickly children get away from these man-made Babylonian theological walls of unbelief and cold formalism run away from man-made theology you shouldn't do that in church says who come on now if it's scriptural I want to stay in a scriptural order but when it comes to but but when it comes to your ideas I'm not under your form of worship I'm not it's not God and then you and then me so we should always be free to worship there should be there's no judgment because here God's up here and there's not it's not God and then the pastor and if the pastor says it's okay then I can do it that's not how that works but if your worship is pleasing to God that's the way it are that's who you should be concerned about and if it's pleasing to God it'll be according to the word right are you with me so far so I don't have to answer to you and you don't have to answer there's freedom in that isn't there there's Freedom I'm an individual in the house of God and I have a right to respond to the word the way I want to I got a right to respond to the house to the house of God I got a right to shout or not shout I gotta write this but I tell you what every time the word of God is preached it's just something inside of me I want to respond to it I'm not subject to your form of worship that's right are you with me now neither are you mine Hallelujah he said run away from those walls get out in the middle of the field that's where we want to be by the spirit in the middle of the field of God's grace at their screen for Mercy for it is his blood of his own son that gives the mercy to us get away from this whole world of Doubt get away from your superstitions accept God's message of mercy and his message of Deliverance and flee to the middle of his grace oh that's where I want to be flee to the middle of his grace in their Scream oh Jesus thou Son of God have mercy on me Hallelujah again brother Brown says would you stand to your feet just a minute oh God be merciful run people hurry hurry hurry get to Christ as quick as you can get away from these modern walls of this formalism get into the middle of God's grace quickly oh you Baptist Methodist Pentecostal Nazarene Pilgrim Holiness Catholic all of you get away from these modern Church walls you feel like you're secure because it's a great church nothing against it but brother unless you're found in his grace covered with his goodness and his power what good will it do you the church won't save you so get away from those walls Hallelujah he talked about it why little Bethlehem you got to preach with me tonight why a little Beth to him I I'm kind of trying to push through for a reason I I don't want to leave you on a Sunday afternoon until somebody tired and and worried and worried about what's going to happen the week your mind starts to drift I I want to I want to focus you back on the word of God when our hearts to be focused back on the word of God I hear David brother Brown talks about David how that his Gentile Warriors wanted to bring him a drink because it was his desire that was expressed he didn't even tell them to do it but it was just an expressed desire all that I would have a drink of the well that's at Bethlehem and his men just went and did it because his wish was their command brother Brown said they knew one day he would be king and we know that one day Jesus would be king amen he's King to us and one day he'll be king over this Earth he's coming back to sit on the throne of David so he talked about how that these men were doing and he said the the garrisons of the Philistines in formalism he ties it to formalism that they had they had gathered they had garrisoned around Bethlehem but those three Gentile Warriors picked up their swords or at least two of them did if you've ever heard by the Daryl Ward preached on that he said two of them carried a sword one carried a bucket somebody had to carry the bucket but but the hair they they had Gentile Warriors had I had to face through all this thing they picked up their swords in their bucket and they walked through 15 miles they went through 15 miles of Philistines why did they do that why because they had to break the walls of formalism to get David a drink oh my sometimes we need to break the walls that are for holding us back from giving Christ a drink but I was raised like this and I come up in a church it was like this I just want you to be free to give Christ a dream if he wants a drink let's give him a drink yes sir oh he said oh brother I wonder if the Warriors today are willing to cut their ways how many are willing now I wonder if they're willing to cut through formally some doubts and unbelief to refresh in the presence of the Lord in his desires in this time of church world and church joining and formalism and things that we have in the world today lukewarm church members scoffers making fun having a form of Godless denying the power of the Holy Spirit which were commanded to turn from in that very hour of that Wicked adulterous generation Jesus Christ Rises and in the power of his resurrection to prove that he's Alive forevermore the same yesterday today and forever in this time of formalism this is the hour when we must be free in our worship oh my what else keeps us back formalism holds us back forms of worship Pride keeps us back we have a pride in our place many times in our place in whether it's the house where we worship the place where we worship for our church or our community or our family it's a pride in our position many times it keeps us from worshiping I'm not rebuking you today I'm just we're just trying to explain we want a free spirit we want we want the church to be able to be free we want to be able to worship according to dictator I should not feel like I should not feel like that I have to tone it down hope you're with me now now if it's a holy ghost in me I'm not going to do anything out of order and if I would I'm gonna read it to you in a minute if I would get out of order a little bit the holy spirit will set me right there's a word here to set us right we're going to get but we'll be balanced out but I should not be afraid to worship there shouldn't be a fear around the Church of whether or not well I'm I'm so afraid or a pride that keeps us from doing that yeah that's good brother Brown said that really Worship in a mission where it been swept out or a bar room think about it and have the freedom of the Holy Spirit and the love of God burning into the heart that sin in the greatest Cathedral that we got in the world and be cramped down with man's doctrines and dogmas yes the pride of places The Pride people get proud I'm gonna actually skip through this next one I'm just going to quote it to you but I've read the quote to you before but the random says what we need is an old-fashioned Jesus Christ entertaining place he said because you're afraid to entertain what your neighbor will see you're afraid of what somebody else might say but you need to worship he said worship you invited him you asked him to come worship him when he come [Applause] Proverbs 16 and 18. who's speaking of pride pride goes Before Destruction how many have found that to be true Pride goeth Before Destruction it's the next scripture I'm sorry I I skip Way Forward Proverbs 16 and 18 Pride goeth Before Destruction and a haughty spirit before a fall right Pride removes you from your place in as a prince you want scripture for that Daniel 4 37 go read Daniel 4. it talks about Nebuchadnezzar he was a king he was a noble he had a had a noble Spirit he had a noble Place position but he got proud he started looking around said see what I've done yeah and God said I'm going to show this world ruler amen I'm still God in heaven oh my I believe God's still doing that today I'm going to show this world ruler I'm still God in heaven I'm still Jehovah I still have control over world affairs and so he makes him he calls it an insane Spirit to come on him and he goes out in the wilderness and starts to eat grass like a cow his fingernails got long and he's out there with no clothes on eating grass of the field a king why Pride went before a fall Pride took away his willing Spirit Pride took away his ability to give well how many times have I seen people that got proud and they got arrogant and they got better clothes than a better and they forgot and they started they ceased from worshiping God they began to be absent from church and they begin to be absent from a place of worship they forgot to lift their hands they forgot to praise God for the room said it's like the pig Under The Apple Tree the but the apples are just falling he don't ever look up and see where it comes from and Nebuchadnezzar ended up in this place in Daniel 4 37 he said now after he'd been restored he said now I nebuchadne has some praise and it stole and honored the king of Heaven he got his worship back when he realized when he recovered from that because he realized I'm not God if you'd realize you weren't God you'd worship God a lot more [Applause] come on church we spend all our time judging somebody else and worried about what somebody else is doing if you'd recognize you're not God you might lift your hands once in a while and worship God amen hey man he said no I Nebuchadnezzar praise and it's stolen honor the king of Heaven all whose works are truth and his ways judgment and those that walk in Pride he is able to abase well it's our freedom and worship it's Freedom From Fear Freedom From Fear there's some people who are afraid to worship because they might get in the flesh and displease God I think we've all felt that way at some point and some of it's a result of false teaching but the random talked about that woman who washed Jesus feet and he said this he said could you lay down aside all your worldly social entertainment to come to the Lord Jesus to be entertained by him to God have mercy she elbowed right on through she was going to get there regardless of how vile she was right he said oh I know it was out of order it wasn't it wasn't an order for her to do that said God help us to get out of order once in a while he said the trouble of it is you got too much order I see we're balancing these things out we preach on Church order lately and I believe in church order but every once in a while you need to make sure that Jesus has what he has a need you need to meet that need you need to worship him when he comes get out of order he said hope the church gets out of order long enough to get saved he said I remember when Jesus saved me you want to hear about brother Brandon's salvation experience I remember when Jesus saved me he said oh my I never forget it he said this little old Kentucky heart of mine was jumping 90 miles an hour I wept I cried I shouted I don't care who was standing around I wasn't paying attention to order I was in the presence of Jesus I loved him Hallelujah oh he tells the story about the eagle and about how the Eagles watching we we've used it recently Eagles watching all the little chicks All the Little Eagles running around they're running around in the grass tumbling over one another flopping and everything else and then Mama Eagles just watching and brother Brandon says this little Eagle just a flopping around he said you know they're having a Pentecostal Jubilee just a shouting and a jumping he said they believe if my mother took them up there oh I love this mother can take care of them so they're free they're worshiping free they're down there in the green grass it's so soft it's so nice and then unaware of the danger said a coyote could come in a wolf could come in a cougar could come in and grab them little them little eaglets but before they could get oh my before the wolf could get there Mama Eagle would be there before the cougar could get there Mama Eagle would be there to bring a balance are you whisping out say well I might get in the flesh a little bit he's watching over you you shouldn't fear that because Mama Eagles watching over you to watch when you get a confession a little bit to balance you out Oh my he said they believe it mother took them up there mother can take care of them if God told me to trust him I'll just trust him I don't care how topsy-turvy I get he will help me out somehow I don't know but the only thing I know what to flop my wings all the faith I've got he said in the New and Old Testament he said oh my fluff them back and forth Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever just keep on flopping and flying somehow or another if he sends a rushing Mighty Wind he throws all the loose feathers out he said you can stand it or he wouldn't take you up there just put your trust in him one time see what he'll do that's your solo flight Oh my he said just flop then just keep on whether going up or down or whichever way you're doing mother's standing right out there soaring right around say well I don't worship very good I'm not as good at worshiping as some others since when did worship become a performance I'm not good at it when you have to be good at worshiping God just flop that's what the prophet said Hallelujah Mama Eagle's out there somewhere his eyes on the sparrow and I know he watches me in and out of his church he said to see if you get out of topsy-turvy something will happen the big wings the word of God will bring you right up right back up he said somebody said that's Wildfire I'd rather have a little Wildfire than no fire at all yes sir [Applause] I worry about Wildfire but I'm scared to death with no fire are you with me now you worry about Wildfire but I'm scared to death with no fire without fire you'll freeze to death it's a cold world out there without fire you'll freeze to death I don't want I don't want it to be wildfire and be out of control but but I'd rather have wildfires than no fire at all and if you have a balance of the word it's a false dilemma it's a false choice you don't have to be out of control to worship God but it might help to get away from formalism a little bit to worship God again some of us just aren't that expressive that's okay that's all right some people don't worship the way other people worship but you're you're you're you're you're a king you're a priest you're offering spiritual sacrifice in yourself in whatever way brother JT that God moves on your heart be free and do that [Applause] and then if it's so if it's God it won't get out of order if it does the word will call it out that's why we have pastors and evangelists and Prophets and teachers and five a five-fold Ministry Apostle we have those because it's to keep the church balanced keep them corrected the word of God now he said just think he said he said uh think if it's just a little out of order he said why we'll just catch him on the wing just exactly what it is bring them back into Grace again let them flop I like that that's why I told you even preaching on tongues and stuff there is an order to that but I want to be careful because I don't want to discourage you from getting in the presence of God such a place where your language changes and you're just lost in the spirit of God I don't want to discourage you from that yet there is an order in the church you understand but God will set that order he said just let them flop Oh my he said just let them flop he said he said yes sir just let them go ahead and Shout praise the Lord and holler Hallelujah dance in the spirit whatever they want to do he said if they get out of order we got something here The Wings God will I love this God will never let you drop if you're an eagle [Applause] why do we spend all of our time can you imagine how sad the little Eagle it would be if he's down there in the grass I don't know who I'm preaching to tonight but you listen you're down there in the grass of God's goodness you're just rolling around in it oh you have troubles and trials and tribulation but everything's taken care of he promised he'd feed you he promised he'd take care of you he promised he'd be with you he'd never leave you he's there watching over you yeah that little Eagle sitting there yeah we've all seen uh We've maybe had children like that they're afraid to move you know they're looking around I guess I just want you to enjoy yourself you're seeing a kid go to a park and so worried about the equipment if I've been hearing mom and talk about it too much you can break your neck get out there and want to wear a helmet isn't it wonderful I'm just being myself tonight you just just forgive me but isn't it nice when you see a little child that's willing to play be a kid you just go out there on the jungle gym and wherever that it is I mean I mean come on we survived childhood we had them them merry-go-rounds that were metal and they kept going faster and faster we never did get one to top speed brother Joe I think spin you off breaking armor leg but you were children you were free and brother Madam tells us God wants us to be happy and free like little children living before the father he don't want to sit there worrying oh where's my next meal coming from what am I gonna do what what am I going to say I'm not mocking you tonight but just remember he he's up there he's up there he's watching over you he will never let you drop if you're an eagle he will pick you up back up again he said now if you're a buzzard you're falling anyhow yeah so you'll just splash on the ground but if you're a real Eagle I believe you're a real Eagle tonight you wouldn't be here on a Sunday afternoon I want to hear the word of God if you're illegal you'll listen to the word of God you'll know that's mother's Wing bringing you back to Grace again [Applause] some have been taught I was taught this that if someone tells you to raise your hands or clap your hands you shouldn't do it it's nonsense I can prove that by the word why would you say well if I feel led I'll worship why would you need to feel led to worship God come on imagine a great king of England you know and some little squirt comes up in front of him says well if I fill in I'll bow down he gonna feel led fulfill LED that's what worship means by the way is to prostrate yourself that's what the word means to prostrate yourself before a king oh God imagine well I if I feel led I well I lift my hands in a song service but until I do I'm gonna keep them down all you do is quenching the spirit huh because if everybody was perfectly lead we wouldn't need song leaders or pastors preachers we just all come and each one have a word testimony that's not the way God ordained it yeah sometimes you got to worship when you don't feel in it you say where where's your scripture for that I'm glad you asked Psalm 47 and 1. said oh clap your hands all you people oh that is that what that says but to be like I got my glasses I think he says all clap your hands all you people yeah shout unto God with the voice of Triumph yes well he's trying to tell me what to do yes he is well that's not the New Testament okay first Timothy two and eight I will therefore that men pray everywhere lifting up holy hands yes yes David says clap Paul says lift your hands are you with me so far the man says oh my don't you feel good think friends this is Pentecost worship this is Pentecost let's clap our hands and sing it Pentecostal people everybody now loosen up get that old Methodist formality out of you now come on let's see well they didn't do that in my church okay they do they did in brother Brandon's Church [Music] again he said now to get the coldness off and the shackles broke from around us the Spooks drove away he said what's the matter people can't you realize that we're entering in after the message into a spirit of worship sometimes I'm so tired but I just I want to stay out here with you all but many times I'll go in the back and I hate it though when the worship shuts down I don't mean you have to linger but sometimes it's just right and we need to worship a little bit I hate to go in the back because I feel like if I leave the platform everybody it's time to go but you're not worshiping me on it great you don't you don't normally worship when the Pastors in the building to get you realize we're entering in after the message into a spirit of worship let's just raise our hands to God he said and worship him and say praise the Lord praise be to God thanks be to the father who gives us the Son of God resurrected from the dead alive forever more Alpha Omega the beginning and the end the rose of Sharon the lily of the valley the Morning Star he that was which is it shall come the root and offspring of David was some worship right here he said how we praise you almighty God for your Omni presence for your visitation to us tonight for the power of your Resurrection for the Assurance of salvation for your great manifestation of your word in this last phase that you promised you would do it in the face of criticism and formalities and everything else you still remain God the same God yesterday today and forever how we thank you for it father he said oh don't you feel good say praise the Lord he said oh that don't sound like Pentecost to me praise the Lord that sounds better Hallelujah he goes on he tells him glory to God I love Jesus praise God he's telling them what to say oh brother Ben we was raised not to do that only when we feel that if I only felt preached when I felt led to preach I would rarely preach that's just the truth and I appreciate when I do have that opportunity to and many times I preach what I feel led but not necessarily when I feel led but the Bible says I'd be instant in season and out of season it's part of the qualifications of my office being a pastor you understand right you're a spiritual priest a priest had to be ready to go in every year or every time he had to go into the holy of holies he had to be ready well it wasn't optional yeah go in and every time you come to the house of God it ought to be something in your heart Lord I'm going to worship you today I'm going to offer spiritual sacrifice I may not feel like it but it's my it's my job and my privilege as the king of the priests very few people can worship in freedom but I will we have freedom from Fear freedom from condemnation yes we get to this then we'll close the Bible says there is therefore now someone say now there's therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus walk not after the flesh but after the spirit now this this verse is not telling you that you don't feel condemned it says you are not condemned think about it think about it I want you to think about it he said there's therefore now no condemnation it means that the sentence has been passed look at that the word for uh for condemnation it's the verdict there is no verdict the devil can indict you but you'll be as free as Donald Trump I have to Loosely up a little bit he can indict you that's his job hate to break it to break it up to a day that's what he does but you don't have to live under condemnation because you know the word yes that says there is therefore now now no condemnation means whatever I did whatever the crime was there is therefore now no condemnation regardless of how I feel so I can worship with all of my heart because I am now free I am not a save anymore I am not in bondage anymore these shackles do not hold me anymore the devil has no legal right to hold you there is therefore now no condemnation [Applause] so will I wait till I quit feeling condemned you'll never worship yes sir but if you'll worship the condemnation will slip away all right are you with me now brother Branham talked about those slaves that were waiting for emancipation day they were waiting on the sunrise for the bill they were sitting at home they were on the hill and they were waiting they were all up and down the hill there was somebody at the top that as soon as the sun come up he passed the word along it's emancipation day we're free we're free and the next one said we're free we're free it might have taken some time but when the one at the bottom of the hill he may not have been able to see the Sun but he heard the message said I'm free there is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus I'm free doesn't mean you won't ever don't mean you'll always feel free yeah you're free you are free it's a greater thing than feeling free you are free what makes you feel free is your faith in that promise that's good glory to God now but the parent said he talked about him says he said how much more ought we to be waiting today for the Son of God we're free from sin we're free from shackles we're free from Habits we're free from smoking drinking crowding some of you ought to be able to say Amen to that because the Son of God has raised from the grave and has broke every fatter all condemnation is gone the debt has been paid the penalty has paid the sins are washed away and we are free oh we are free people slavery Freedom when the Son of God Rises with healing in his wings he said someday he'll rise from the throne come back to the Earth and then we'll be free oh there's coming a day church will be free from these bodies we'll be free from all pain and all temptation free from all Mortal aches and whatever goes with Mortal life to live with him forever look at Revelation 12 and 9 it says the Great Dragon was cast out that old serpent called the devil and Satan which deceives the whole world he was cast out of the earth as Angels were cast out with him verse 10 and I heard a loud voice saying in heaven now has come salvation and strength in the Kingdom of our God and the power of His Christ for the Accuser the prosecutor that made the that indicted you that made the accusation has been cast down oh Hallelujah the accused of our Brothers cast down which accused him before our God day and night and listen and they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb there's therefore now no condemnation and by the word of their testimony who walked not after the flesh but after the spirit who don't believe the the dictates of the flesh but believe what the word says you realize what they did John is presenting that like a courtroom said the accuser that word in the it's prosecutor the prosecutor is cast down the prosecutor has been found out he was Prosecuting for political purposes he's been found out Hallelujah are you free today [Music] you got to stand up in your own defense stuff glory to God you've been made free the verdict from the the judge came in our day and said you're free but he said the word of their testimony that's them standing in their own defense I'm free a pardon is not a pardon unless it's accepted it's one thing for the judge to face free it's one thing for the accuser to be cast down but it's another thing for me to stand in my own defense I'm free I will not believe what the devil tells me about me I will not believe that I'm Bound for hell I will not believe I'm not a Believer I will not believe I'm not a Christian I will not believe that I have to sit on my hands all the time and do nothing I believe I'm a born-again Child of God [Music] free from condemnation free from Fear free from formality how am I going and that's what David's saying he said restore unto me the joy of my salvation uphold me sustain me keep me free by your free spirit your Noble spiritual willing spirit pill dice free spirit but the brand said there's people sitting here that's considered crazy because they're ready to trust God for their healing for their Eternal destination placing their reputation at stake in worship to him thanking him praising him giving freedom to their spirit sir Ben I wish it was freedom in my church have you given freedom to your spirit if you think about it have you given freedom to yourself have you stood up in your own defense not to the pastor not the people around you but to Satan say I'm a Child of God I belong in the house of God I'm standing up in my own defense I will not defend what I did I will not defend my actions will not defend when I was a sinner are you with me now but my defense is based solely on the blood of Jesus Christ and overcoming him his cast down because because of the blood of the lamb and the word of my testimony giving freedom to their Spirit to worship God they're considered crazy but you said that the foolishness of God if we are fools what's stronger and wiser than the wisdom of man for a man by wisdom no not God but through the foolishness of preaching it pleased God to save them that was savable I was savable or I wouldn't have been saved of the spirit of Life musicians go ahead and come the law of the spirit of Life In Christ hath made me free from the law of sin and death for what the law could not do in that it was weak through the flesh God sending his own son in the likeness of sinful flesh for sin condemns sin in the flesh this is why there is therefore now no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus no verdict no verdict no one to tell you you're guilty just like the woman it was caught in adultery and Jesus said where are your accusers she looked around and they're gone everyone I'm God Satan oh God oh my in the face of the blood Satan had to had to had to fall from his position as accuser and every one of his imps and his demons and people he gets a hold of have to fall from their position as an accuser in the face of the blood of Jesus Christ to Paul this was a declaration imagine for Paul to write there is therefore now no condemnation meant something because Paul had reason to be condemned he had people probably that still condemned him because he he caused their sons and their daughters to be killed he went and did some things he shouldn't have done it is zealousness to try to go he said I did it in ignorance but this was a declaration it was a declaration he said there is therefore now no condemnation to Paul you're right that's right I hope you hear me today I wonder if we can put our name there there's no therefore now no condemnation to Ben through it who is in Christ Jesus who walks not after the flesh but after the spirit there is therefore now no condemnation to you whatever your name is it's a declaration I'm standing in my own defense Paul standing in his own defense and said I I read chapter seven he's saying what I would do I couldn't do and I was caught in this position he said oh Wretched Man that I am who will deliver me from the body of this death and he goes out and comedually says there's therefore now Hallelujah no condemnation he still had the battle he still fought those thoughts but he said I'm free he declared he stood up in his own defense and when you do Satan has to fall you can worship in Freedom amen should bow your heads with me for a moment why don't you declare it now I am redeemed there's no condemnation to me I'm gonna stand him on defense tonight not by my Merit but by the word of God not who I was foreign Something's Happened [Music] maybe there's formalism that's coming to worship maybe fear has hindered your worship oppression or something that comes in you feel like I'm just not worthy maybe condemnation why don't you believe the word tonight over your own symptoms you got to do that when you're sick why don't you do that for your salvation leave the word over your own symptoms I am redeemed there is therefore now no condemnation to me can you imagine the man who gets a pardon from the president he gets a pardon from the highest Authority in the land he may have been accused he may have done it but when he receives the pardon in the mailbox it's got the president's signature on it if he receives it he can walk away from that mailbox and say there is therefore now no verdict against me they tried me and found me guilty but they're so verdict the people tried me and found me guilty the devil tried me and found me guilty but there is therefore now no condemnation I hope we get a revelation of that tonight and begin to Worship in Freedom begin to realize God is still on the throne he's the same yesterday today and forever he said but oh so-and-so failed they shouldn't worship I failed I shouldn't worship nonsense you're before the king worshiping freedom it'll be okay it'll be all right you're free read Departed there is therefore now no verdict against me because I am in Christ Jesus Heavenly Father Lord there's people here with their hands up some With Tears in their eyes Lord I myself oh God it just does something to me when I think of what you did for me there on Calvary Lord I'll never get over that when I think lord of the freedom that you've given me let me stand up for that Lord let me stand up for your right to be worshiped you're right to be your right to be praised in spite of formalism in spite of the people of the world in spite of the church in spite of this layout of seeing lukewarm age oh God worship is not a big band somewhere in a light show but worship is a True Heart crying out to you asking for what they have need of and then worshiping you and praising you because you they know it's already done oh we're so thankful for
