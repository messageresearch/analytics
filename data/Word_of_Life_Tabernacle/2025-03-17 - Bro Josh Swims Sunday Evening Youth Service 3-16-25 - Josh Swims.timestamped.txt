[49:30] me as the speaker to get myself out of
[49:33] the way that you would just come and
[49:34] speak to your people and those that

[49:38] internet Lord that they could just
[49:40] receive exactly what it is that they
[49:42] have need of here tonight Lord no doubt
[49:44] there's maybe some that are sick and

[50:06] young people now in Jesus Christ's name
[50:09] amen God bless you this evening it's
[50:11] good to be here brother Ben's asked me
[50:14] several times to come and it just hasn't
[50:16] worked out for us to be here but it
[50:18] worked out this time so we uh we just
[50:21] try to surrender and yield ourselves to
[50:23] the Holy Spirit if we could let's turn
[50:24] over into the book of uh Luke chapter
[50:28] 7 um and we'll start reading here at
[50:30] verse 36 and just a a very familiar
[50:34] scripture to us tonight and a very
[50:37] simple I'm just going to be a very
[50:38] simple message and I'm not a very
[50:40] complicated person I'm a very simple
[50:42] person and so you know I believe that uh
[50:45] you know before brother brandom he could
[50:47] preach the seals and things he brought a
[50:49] message of God hiding himself and
[50:51] simplicity and so sometimes we uh as
[50:54] message Believers because we have so
[50:56] much available to us we think on high
[51:01] high levels but God's down here with a
[51:04] with the children you know he said you
[51:07] know to have a childlike faith and so
[51:10] let's uh let's just look at this little
[51:11] scripture here tonight for for a little
[51:14] while and here it says and one of the
[51:16] Pharisees desired him he says that he
[51:20] would eat with him and he went in into
[51:23] the Pharisees house and sat down to meet
[51:27] and it says and behold a woman in the
[51:29] city which was a sinner he says when she
[51:32] knew that Jesus sat at meat in the
[51:34] Pharisees house brought an alabaster box
[51:37] of ointment and stood At His Feet behind
[51:40] him weeping says and began to wash his
[51:43] feet with tears and did wipe them with
[51:45] the hairs of her head and kissed his
[51:48] feet and anointed them with ointment
[51:51] thank you Lord says and when the
[51:52] Pharisee which had bidden him saw it
[51:56] notice he said he spake within himself
[51:58] saying this man if he were a prophet say
[52:01] he would which had bidden him he said
[52:04] saw him he said spake within himself if
[52:06] this man was a prophet he would have
[52:07] known who what manner of woman that this
[52:09] was that toucheth him for she is a
[52:12] sinner yeah says and Jesus answering
[52:15] said unto him he says Simon he says I
[52:18] have somewhat to say unto thee says he
[52:22] saith Master say on says and there was a
[52:25] certain creditor which which had two
[52:27] debts says one owed him 500 p and the
[52:30] other 50 says and when they had nothing
[52:33] to pay he says he frankly forgave them
[52:37] both and then Jesus says he says now
[52:40] tell me therefore he says which of them
[52:43] will love him the most and Simon
[52:46] answered and said I suppose that he to
[52:48] whom he forgave the most he says he said
[52:52] unto him thou Hast rightly judged and he
[52:54] turned to the woman and said unto Simon
[52:57] he says seest Thou this woman he says I
[52:59] entered into thine house says Thou
[53:02] gavest me no water for my feet but she
[53:05] has washed me my feet with tears says
[53:09] and wipe them with the hairs of her head
[53:12] says Thou gavest me no kiss said but
[53:15] this woman since the time I came in hath
[53:17] not ceased to kiss my feet says my head
[53:21] with oil thou did not anoint said but
[53:24] this woman hath anointed my feet with
[53:26] ointment says wherefore I say unto thee
[53:29] he says her sins which are many are
[53:32] forgiven he says for she loved much but
[53:36] to whom little Is Forgiven the same
[53:38] loveth little he said unto her thy sins
[53:41] are forgiven he says and they that set
[53:44] at meat with him began to say within
[53:46] themselves who is this that forgiveth
[53:48] sins also and he said to the woman thy
[53:52] faith hath saved thee go in peace thank
[53:55] you Lord praise the Lord Lord with that
[53:56] His blessings you have your seats this
[54:03] evening as we're looking at this tonight
[54:06] and those that come with me I preached
[54:09] this at home here a few weeks ago but
[54:11] you know it's something about whenever
[54:12] you get out it's never the same message
[54:14] that that you that you fir that you
[54:16] first preach but you just have to just
[54:20] as a as we look at these things and you
[54:22] know how that brother brandham he would
[54:23] uh
[54:24] dramatize uh uh picture uh he would try
[54:28] to draw you out a picture in the Bible
[54:30] of a of a story like this and we're
[54:31] going to try to do that uh in the
[54:33] Simplicity of it if we could tonight but
[54:36] here you know I took this thought and I
[54:38] was thinking about these things here a
[54:39] few weeks ago and I was in this this
[54:43] instance in the Bible it come to me you
[54:45] know this woman she was on the outside
[54:47] of the church she was on the outside of
[54:50] the of the house and she was looking in
[54:53] and she she had a different perspective
[54:57] of those that were sitting within the
[54:59] congregation because here she was
[55:01] looking at this in in a way that you
[55:04] know that those that were entered in
[55:07] they were they were mingling with one
[55:09] another they were having fellowship with
[55:11] one another they were they were
[55:12] rejoicing they were they were clanking
[55:14] their wine glasses together they were
[55:15] having a wonderful time brother Bon but
[55:18] this woman on the outside that was
[55:20] looking in yeah come on she seen
[55:23] something more important than having all
[55:25] the fellowship that they were having all
[55:27] all the all the the wonderful time that
[55:29] everybody else was having she's seen
[55:31] something different Church she seen
[55:33] Jesus over here in the corner an
[55:36] unwelcome guest in the in the in the
[55:39] house of the Pharisee sir her being a
[55:42] sinner yeah come on right she's seen
[55:45] something different Church see there was
[55:48] something the woman she was curious as
[55:51] she was walking by the house she started
[55:54] to hear commotion and you just just bear
[55:57] with me for a moment we're going to try
[55:59] and you just picture this in your head
[56:00] especially you young people you picture
[56:02] this in your mind as this woman she's
[56:05] walking by the house and you know many
[56:07] times and I just speak quite frankly
[56:10] with you I know some of you young people
[56:11] you probably don't even want to be here
[56:13] tonight I was that young person one time
[56:16] mom and daddy drugg me to church but you
[56:18] know God has a way of working things out
[56:20] and here this woman she was walking
[56:22] along the road and she heard a commotion
[56:25] y she heard something brother Joel she
[56:28] that attracted her attention and so she
[56:31] walked up and she she knew that she was
[56:33] not welcome at Simon's house but there
[56:36] she was she was able to gaze through the
[56:38] window of the house and she no doubt she
[56:41] looked around and she seen all the
[56:43] people that had made fun of her that had
[56:46] all all the things that they had said
[56:48] about her and all these things were
[56:49] going through her
[56:51] mind and she seen somebody A peculiar
[56:55] somebody in the corner yeah said what is
[56:58] this and there was something within her
[57:01] heart that her heart started to beat
[57:05] there was something within her her heart
[57:07] started to move with
[57:09] compassion she there was something
[57:11] taking place that that she had never she
[57:14] had never been had had happened to her
[57:16] before right amen and so as she's
[57:19] looking through these things and she
[57:21] sees that the different ones having a
[57:23] wonderful time yeah she sees that the
[57:26] the the the ones that they were
[57:29] everybody was welcome but one yeah come
[57:33] on
[57:35] and it troubled
[57:38] her now why would this trouble a sinner
[57:40] woman like her come on why would why
[57:43] would this but there was seed there was
[57:45] a seed that was laying there from before
[57:48] the foundation of the world that there
[57:51] was something taking place within this
[57:53] woman no doubt maybe she was raised in
[57:56] Message Church put it just put it in my
[57:59] own words tonight cu no doubt many of
[58:01] you have been raised in a message church
[58:03] here tonight many of you are maybe two
[58:06] or three generations raised in a message
[58:08] Church some of you older ones here
[58:09] tonight I I was raised in a message
[58:11] Church 36 years old and so we we we're
[58:15] many generations maybe that's been
[58:17] raised in a message church maybe this
[58:19] woman she was raised in a message church
[58:22] and somehow along the way she thought
[58:24] well I'll do my own thing I'll go out
[58:26] whenever and we're all like that
[58:28] sometimes we when we get 16 17 18 years
[58:31] old we want hey I'm going to go do my
[58:33] own thing I'm going to do what Mom and
[58:35] Daddy said I can't do no more come on
[58:37] now some of you older ones can testify
[58:39] to it there's a sister in the back that
[58:41] raised her hand she could testified to
[58:42] it we've all done those things and so
[58:46] here maybe she was raised in a message
[58:48] church and she was she she she was just
[58:52] and it come a point that she said you
[58:53] know I'm going to do my own thing
[58:57] I want
[58:58] to I'm going to seek what the world's
[59:00] got to
[59:02] offer I'm want to I'm going to see what
[59:05] how all the friends that all my worldly
[59:07] friends all the good times that they
[59:09] have out there I'm going to somehow she
[59:12] got on the outside and she become an
[59:15] ill-famed woman she become somebody that
[59:17] nobody else wanted to be around and see
[59:20] that's what sin will do to you tonight
[59:22] you young people it will take you
[59:23] further than what it ever what you had
[59:25] ever imagine that it would see it's so
[59:28] important that we stay in fellowship
[59:30] with God it's so important that we stay
[59:32] in fellowship with the word of God
[59:34] tonight amen and it come to a point that
[59:38] there was something beating within her
[59:40] heart as she was no doubt she was
[59:42] walking by Simon's house here she seen
[59:45] somebody an unwelcome guest in the
[59:48] corner and this was somebody this is
[59:50] what this is the person my mama was
[59:52] telling me about come on this is the one
[59:55] that my grand parents were telling me
[59:57] about this is the one that the preacher
[59:59] used to preach about on Sunday mornings
[1:00:01] and on Wednesday evenings and this is
[1:00:03] this was the word of God it's something
[1:00:06] within her it started to attract the
[1:00:08] attention of this young woman and she
[1:00:11] noticed that he was unwelcome he hadn't
[1:00:14] been kissed he hadn't been anointed he
[1:00:18] he he was not welcome in the house of

[1:38:00] him and let alone wash his feet and dry
[1:38:03] them with her hair yeah and as she knelt
[1:38:07] before

[1:39:23] R need of
[1:39:25] redemption a heart yearning for
[1:39:27] forgiveness oh yeah he knew that that
