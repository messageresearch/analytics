TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] their heads were low [Music] their steps were slow [Music] as they walked along that long may israel [Music] then a man appeared and as he drew near he said why are you so sad are things really that bad they said sir have you not heard you must be a stranger in this town for the one who came in the father's name [Music] he has been cut down they played his body in the ground as they walked and talked to began to explain about this jesus and why he came he opened the scriptures and began to teach the preacher of preachers he began to preach in the wilderness the children had nothing there to eat but man up from heaven fell down at their feet when they were dry and thirsty in a foreign land living water came forth out of a rock in the sand when the three hebrew children were thrown in the flames a fourth man appeared they even called them by name the man of the water the man they're all the same and if you're still confused i'll just say it real [Applause] i am the one you laughed back there on calvary it was me who do you think hung the stars in the sky who do you think made the day and the night who made the flowers who made the trees who made the sun and the moon in the seas tell me who gives life to all who believe who do you think made the blind to see and who made the very air that you breathe who defeated death and won the victory it was me it was me i am the one who died for you on calvary it was me [Music] who do you think was the voice in the tree who do you think told the prophet to speak who created squirrels and made the storms to cease and who drove hattie's boys right down to their knees tell me who do you think brought you here today who's coming back to take you home someday and who left this throne to fellowship with you to make himself known to many of you it was me [Music] i am the one who died for you on calvary it was me [Music] [Applause]
