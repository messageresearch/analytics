all for being here and I know it's a holiday weekend so we won't hold you all day but I'm just expecting the Lord to do something aren't you amen you believe that this morning God can speak to us through his word amen uh Genesis 18:1 the Lord appeared unto him in the plains of mamory and he sat in the tent Door In the Heat of the day oh I believe it's hot right now but we have a shade tree we can sit under he lift up his eyes and looked and lo three men stood by him when he saw them he ran to meet them from the tent door and bowed himself toward the ground and said my Lord if now I have found favor in thy sight pass not away I pray thee from thy servant let a little water I pray you be fetched and wash your feet and rest yourselves under the tree I will fetch a morsel of bread and comfort you your hearts after that you shall pass on for therefore are you come to your servant and they said so do as thou Hast said pray the Lord would add his Blessing to the word you may be seated I want to speak to you this morning on Abram Abraham's Dusty clothes Abraham's Dusty clothes Peter you may have to restart that I took a trip to Jeffersonville uh to go to Sister Carol's funeral memorial service there and while I was there I we went by the Tabernacle we wanted to go see brother Billy Paul's Gra and and so we went by the Tabernacle which is very close and as we drove by um I I was struck again I hadn't seen it in in several years and I was struck again at how uh common that it was and and how small it was and the Tabernacle the building that brother Brandon preached in is not much bigger than this one and so uh you begin to look at that and and and they pack a bunch of people in there but it's just not big it's not flashy on my way through Jeffersonville I saw a headquarters of a denomination I've never heard of some group and some Pentecostal group it looked like and they had big letters across the headquarters of it and it showed the uh the buildings and all that was there and I thought well I've never even heard of them and and it looks like they've got uh a larger beginning at least than what the message did and I begin to look at that and begin to think about it you know uh sometimes we don't realize what the message has become as far as the message people but there's message people everywhere people who claim to believe the message and and many of them do I've been to churches all over the world that are just like us and believe many of the same things that you and I believe and and and and preach it and and and declare it and I've been in churches in the Philippines and in Asia I've been in the churches in Africa I've seen churches in Europe I've been in churches in in North America and Canada and everywhere I've been I've seen people who love the Lord and and who believe this message and and they're they're all over the place and uh a lot of people don't realize that there's more messaged people than there are Churches of Christ or Presbyterians or missionary Baptists which is the denomination that brother brandom come out of and yet uh you look at it it's it's it's decentralized there's not a lot of hype about it and brother brandham when he was here he he come in in a in a very simple way he conducted himself in in a way he said that he could preach to to 300,000 or he could preach to three people and he purposely did it that way and and so I was uh I was struck by that and brother Brenham tells the story of how that he went to Tulsa and when he was in Tulsa in 1960 he saw the the headquarters of or Roberts and Tommy Osburn and if you went to Tulsa years ago you probably saw that I think Tommy Osborne's uh headquarters has been torn down when they widened i44 and and but I saw it as a kid and I think uh uh uh Oral Roberts headquarters is now being torn down or has been torn down but I had pictures of that when we get it back up maybe we'll show you brother bandam talked about it and he said when I I seen that solid marble building he said not a window in it nowhere but how it was fixed he said I've been in Hollywood and I've been in King palaces but he said I've never seen anything that would compare to that and he said I stood on the outside and looked back at the building and I and and you can imagine how he must have felt now this was in around 1960 when brother Brandon is being investigated by the IRS because people didn't handle the finances right and as far as they wrote checks to him personally instead of writing them to the church and so brother Brandon was going to owe a bunch of taxes and and so he's going through a lot right then he's got a lot going on on and you can look at the picture that's a picture of the Tabernacle buildings and the first Tabernacle brother brandom had and and the the middle one is the uh a few years later the newer Tabernacle up to the 60s and then the new one is the new building I think I've got a picture of the building more like it is today now they've added another section onto it but it's actually not a a great big place it's very very simple and it doesn't look very very Grand and and if you go to that next picture I think there's a picture of that's oral Robert's headqu there's no comparison to it at all and and it's very very large it was very very ornate and even back in the 50s when it was built it was worth millions of dollars and brother Brandon begins to feel sorry for himself and and and he gets to begin to think a little bit low and and he's comparing himself and I think I had Tommy osburn's headquarters on there as well and what it looked like and he be to feel sorry for himself and begin to think well I started their Ministries and he did the reason or Roberts was here is because he saw what brother brandham was doing and reason Tommy osbor was there he went to a meeting of brother brandom's and he would even attribute it to that and and so he began to think oh God maybe I'm not worthy and he said just in a little voice come down through the corridors as he was standing there in in or Robert's building he said but I am your portion and brother brandham said it like this he said if you're he said if you're my portion that's enough I want to say that's still true today God is our portion that's enough and yet this message has had a much greater impact on the world than or Robert's message did or or uh maybe uh some of the other messengers of that time it's had a much greater impact and as far as the word message that's went forth and the people that believe it but I'll say this to you this morning don't despise the day of small things don't think just because something is little or because it's humble or because there's not a lot of people in church on a Sunday morning don't begin to think think that it's not going to be God in that that God can't move through that because sometimes God shows up in human form and sometimes God shows up with dust on his clothes we established last week that Elohim came down and visited Abraham brother brand said it was the almighty God of Genesis 17 that came down in a body remember he said he just blew like that and it become a body of Flesh and he breathed into it and it was the it was God Elohim he said the flesh wasn't Elohim but the spirit in him was Elohim and Elohim actually walked up to Abraham's tent he appeared before him listen what the scripture says he lifted up his eyes and looked and lo three men stood by him it's Elohim and two angels and when he saw them he ran to meet them from the tent door and bowed himself toward the ground now brother brand said watch the son of man was revealed to Abraham's group as a man a prophet in a form of human flesh an ordinary man with dust on his clothes and Abraham called him Elohim he said now Jesus promises here that in the last days the son of man will be revealed again to that same type of group oyal Seed of Abraham just before the fire falls what type of group will it be a group of Believers because Abraham had believed God for 25 years he'd held on to the promise of God he said so God was going to reveal himself to a group like that to that kind of a group just before the fire falls remember he said the church never received any more witness Abraham and them didn't the promised son that they were looking for was brought right away after that so in other words there wasn't any more sign that they would receive that would tell them that the Rapture was coming the body change was coming the pro promised son was coming but Jeff this was it that was the last sign they would receive before the change of the body he said and the church is looking for the promised son he will come right after the days of this ministry he'll be revealed from the heavens now brother random always identifies him when he come with dust on his clothes now if you've listened to it and you and it struck me as I went down and read through quote after quote and sermon after sermon brother ROM always identifies him this way he said we're uh he talks about it he said we're strangers said we've come from a foreign country their clothes were Dusty and again they just appeared in front of him right because the Bible says that they uh he L lifted up his eyes and there they were right and maybe there was a road that went by where Abraham's tent was and he just sitting there in the tent door and as he sat there I'm going going to sit down and preach but when he sat there he he he sat there and he just kind of pondering on the day and what's going on thinking about the things of the Lord and In the Heat of the day taking a break from his work and he's sitting there sweating you know and In the Heat of the day thankful for the shade tree that he has and as he sits there suddenly he he looked up and oh three men now if you saw three men what's the first thing that you would think well who are they where do they come from and he saw when he saw them they looked like they'd come from another place they looked like they come down a dusty road they look like every other traveler on that road look like but Abraham recognized there was something different about them so the dust on the clothes oh Church the dust on the clothes would have hidden deity from a normal person from any other type of person the dust on the clothes would have been proof this couldn't be God because if it was God he' come from another dimension he come if he come down from heaven how did he get dust on his clothes but Abraham didn't try to solve the mystery of the Dust oh I hope you hear me today I got questions this week and uh things that people are dealing with in the message people on the internet trying to put down on the message about well brother brandham was here and he was here and and why wasn't it bigger and why didn't he do this and someone asked me did Brother brandham really travel seven times around the world and I said well not in sh not in a straight line right and yet he went seven times he said about around the world but he was saying just about how far he'd been but people what is it there's dust on it there's dust on the messenger there's dust on the message there's dust on God's people there's dirt that people have been throwing on the message and I want you to know this morning we got to be able to look past that dirt and Abraham was the type of a man brother the story that he could look past the dust on the clothes that that Elohim had and see there's something real about him right oh Church it looked like they'd come from a foreign country in fact the dust to an unbeliever would have been proof it wasn't real to an unbeliever the dust is is proof that there's no God in it but to Abraham it just meant God was hiding himself Hallelujah imagine them coming down you know they're coming down and they got dust on their clothes and be like these three young men here we'd expect them to have dust on their clothes if they were out playing but you wouldn't expect God to have dust on his clothes right you wouldn't expect God to come down in that kind of a form but that's the way he came right right he come down walk in a dusty road with dust on his clothes I don't know how it got there I don't know I don't know if he because brother R say he just appeared the Bible speaks as if he just appeared there I don't know if he went down around the bend and and and they all dumped dust on themselves and then went around I don't know I don't know how that happened I I don't know if it was Supernatural dust but again Abraham didn't try to solve the mystery of the dust that wasn't his job his job was to recognize so Church it is not our job to solve the mystery of the Dust it's not our job to try to try to analyze everything and and legalize everything and make everybody the same that's not our job but to see past the dust to see deity it's a challenge it'll take somebody with faith predestined to believe it do you believe that today and look he said he kept looking down to them he said these are strange fellows they're Dusty traveled far they did From Another Dimension oh he said when he set him down there he said though they didn't look any different from any other men because they were dressed dust on their clothes come from some other country probably their feet Dusty and their clothes ragged H imagine God coming down and purposefully he had to do it on purpose because he could have put himself in any kind of close he could have looked like brother Joel he could have looked like me and maybe not but he could have looked he could have dressed himself good worn a suit and tie wore a turban wore a a great kingly robe that's how he could have come right and there were times he come as MDC he come he come in different forms and different ways but but here he come with dust on his clothes with dust on his clothes looking like he was from another country look like he traveled a long time he'd come hungry Elohim oh God Elohim created a body that was automatically hungry think about it it' just been created a few minutes before and he create church he created himself a body that was hungry he created himself a body with dirt on his feet yeah dust on his clothes look he said dust on their clothes come from some other country probably their feet Dusty in their clothes ragging Abraham knew inside there there was something real the spirit declared it why he kept now listen how could he see it he kept himself in a spiritual atmosphere all the time many times the reason we can't see things is because we don't keep ourselves in a spiritual atmosphere but he said he kept himself in a spiritual atmosphere all the time that he could recognize right from wrong all the time listen to me young people you need to keep yourselves in a spiritual atmosphere so you can recognize right and wrong you won't always have to have somebody tell you what's right and wrong but you can recognize right and wrong why you read your Bible that morning you prayed that morning you can recognize right from wrong and you're going to have to be able cuz many times the a the the devil appears as an angel of Light but you got to be able to recognize that's not him and when God Appears when Elohim comes down down but he comes with Dusty clothes on you got to be able to recognize that too right are you with me now you said brother Ben you're far out there I no I'm I'm really not look brother brandham says it about Dusty clothes and you can you can go find it in the message prob dozens maybe hundreds of times brother brandham talks about dust on their clothes why did he keep telling us that where does he get it Genesis 8 183 look what Abraham said he said my Lord my Lord's my Lord if now I have found favor in thy sight pass not away I pray thee from thy servant words they look like they were just going to continue on that's the way he comes many times that's until he come to those on the road to emus it says he made as if he was going to go on down the road they constrained him compelled him to come in many times he he acts like he's just passing through and the service is just going to be another service and it seems like it's just going to be another day but sometimes we just got to compel him to stay Lord how can I make you welcome how can I entertain you how can I make this service better than the last one how can I make this this time with you how can I make my prayer time a moment where you can stay with me all of the day and he wants to he he has a desire to stay but he won't force himself on you right he had a desire he had a word to get to Abraham oh my but he had to Abraham had to invite him in said pass not away from thy servant let a little water I pray you be fetched now watch what he's doing this is where brother BR gets the dust on his clothes right he wash your feet if he had dust on his feet he must have had dust on his clothes he needed his feet wash and rest yourselves under the tree oh my here's our church Lord I hope you're hear me this morning I know it's Labor Day weekend and not everybody's here but could we just could we just break down for a minute and just kind of let the barriers go a little bit and just have church for a minute this is our church lord it's all we got to offer just a tree it's not perfect but it's one you restored it's a tree built by the message of the hour it's one you restored Lord this is our tree Lord would you come in I'll wash the dirt off of you brother BR in one place he said he dusted off elohim's clothes he dusted his clothes off and washed his feet and the Bible says he stood there and watched him meat ran out and got the calf and and and watched him eat cornbread and H cakes he said and and those things what was it it was God B him invited in and so when he was invited in stayed and I think all of us need to hear from God we need to hear the word of the lord we need to hear a direct Revelation from God if we're ever going to make a body change there's something we need to hear and we need to hear what Abraham or we need to hear the message of the hour but we can only hear it in the right atmosphere it's got to be under the shade tree it's got to be in the door of the tent it's got to be in the heat of the day it's got to be when Elohim comes by and we invite him to stay I send him on down the road not rush to the service so we can get done whatever we want to get done but let's stay Elohim I believe it's you I can see past the musicians I can see past the preacher I can see Pastor deacons I believe it's you Elohim I want you to stay oh church this just been on my heart ever since I W I drove by the Tabernacle and I saw the dust on that building I thought God there's dust on your clothes but it's still you it wasn't the angel the Lord Brother brand said that was God himself Abraham said it was he had on clothes like a man dust all over him come from a far country but Abraham saw God face to face there why he went out and look what he did he eat meat Abraham went and killed a calf B brought some butter out and Sarah needed some bread made some H cakes brought it out the almighty with dust on his clothes sat down and eat a calf and drinking milk and eat hot cakes oh my listen before Abraham could receive this promise he had to wash the dirt off the feet of Elohim if we're going to receive a body change I believe we're looking forward to that aren't we I trust that we all are we first got to wash the dirt off of this message all right I think maybe if we would entertain him a little bit more if we'd wash the dirt off of his feet if we'd make him feel welcome maybe our kids would understand that that that this is a place they need to be too where Elohim is speaking it's not someplace we just go once in a while when we feel like it but it's some place that Elohim speaks to us sometimes and and even our prayer closets the same way it's not just the church but when we're at home and when we're praying we're calling out to God let it be a place that's special a place that this is where I meet God I can meet him anywhere but let meet him here yes at the appointed time all right come on oh my wash the dirt off of it don't make it look like well that's just a bunch of crazy people a bunch of Holy Rollers a bunch of message people up there we shouldn't talk about the message that way to our children huh we got a great message we should learn to be positive about it we should be able to look past the dust on the yeah there's a lot of crazies yeah there's a lot of Cults yeah there's a lot of nonsense but there's something real on the inside there's something something real down on the inside of Word of Life Tabernacle there something real in Hardy Arkansas there's something real in the message of the hour it's not just dirt got to wash that dirt off yes one time one of Abraham's seed was caught in a condition of life where she was a prostitute but she was still Abraham's seed brother Bron she hadd been turned out by her parents but she was still Abraham's seed and one of the Pharisees desired him that he would eat with him and he went into the Pharisees house sat down to me he invited him but he didn't do like Abraham he didn't make him feel welcome Oh my he said behold a woman in the city which was a sinner when she knew that Jesus said at me and the Pharisees house brought an alabaster box of ointment and stood At His Feet behind him weeping and began to wash his feet with tears and did wipe them with the hairs of her head and kissed his feet and anointed them with the or what was it it was Abraham or it was Elohim rather again and Abraham seed a face seed Royal seed recognized that Elohim was back in flesh and his clothes were Dusty and his feet were dirty but she said I'm going to do something about that I'm going to look past that I'm going to do something about that I'm G to make sure that my kids know or something about this message just because it was delivered in the shell of dust doesn't mean that there's not Supernatural in it right she had to do a service for him she looked at him you all know the story brother Brandon preach it many times the unwelcome Christ the meanest man in the city The Pride preach it many different ways and and he said she had to do a service for him she had heard of him that's what Abraham was doing she'd seen him with her eyes she had a service to do she had nothing to do it with and I think many times that's what stops us from from worshiping because we feel like well I just don't have the qualifications or I'm not a piano player I'm not a I'm not a a drummer I'm not a preacher I'll just sit back and and I'll and I'll just watch and I'll just see what goes on but but many times that keeps us from worship say well I got nothing to do it with well didn't either he just there was something needed done and all she had she went and bought that out she spent all of her money buy an alabaster box of ointment That's All She had she didn't have money to buy she didn't have any extra to buy a basin or or get some water or buy a ra even a rag to wash his feet with so brother brandom tells us that she had nothing to do it with so she rushed forward anyhow even though she didn't feel qualified even though she oh Church she didn't feel like that she'd be able to do it if you knew how unqualified I felt to stand in this Pulpit this morning if you knew how unqualified many times these ministers these men of God who'd stand here feel you'd feel like well you'd say well why did they even go but it's because there's a service that needs to be done he wants his feet washed there's dust on him and I'll do everything I can to keep the message clean keep the dust off yeah if I can preach and do that if I can sit in the Pew and do that if I can pay my tith and do that if I can go to church and do that whatever it takes let me do it with all of my heart if raising my hands if that's all I have that's what he wants yes see he didn't want oh church he didn't want water from Pharisees house he wanted the tears from her eyes he didn't want a a great Egyptian towel that that they could wipe his feet with he wanted the hair on her head he doesn't want so he doesn't want your gifts he doesn't want your your abilities he wants you he wants you he wants me she recognize a service needs to be done Abraham recognize there's a service that needs to be done I see something more in this man than just a man I'm going to wash his feet brother BR said she had heard of a living God all over life but now she's seen him with her eyes she knew it was him an inspiration struck her and she said this is the messenger oh church he needed a service she had nothing to serve him by his feet was dirty but she rushed forward anyhow to do him a service because she was inspired to do it you say well I would do that for Jesus but the way you treat the body of Christ today is the way you would have treated the body of Christ then because it's veiled in the same way Abraham wasn't embarrassed to wash his feet I wonder if we're embarrassed sometimes I wonder where our willingness is and I'm not rebuking you this morning I'm preaching to myself to my children to my home to the people that that want to hear it where's our willingness to do whatever we can for the message of the hour you're not do doing it for me and I've always looked at it like that church and I think it's a mistake to look at it as doing it for the church we're doing it for the body of Christ and that's not just in Hardy Arkansas that's everywhere but we should focus on our own church first I believe that but but the body of Christ is everywhere it's spread over the world we don't we don't just we don't just love people who love us we don't just fellowship with people who fellowship with us we don't just reach out to people who reach out to us we don't just be kind to people who've been kind to us Jesus said even the publicans the tax collectors can do that he said but what about reaching out to somebody who asked you to go a mile and you go with him too who who ask of your coat and you give him your your shirt too where is our willingness to do whatever we can you say well it's not much don't let that stop you God will use you like he did her like he did Abraham see the guests didn't know him BR said they was ashamed of him because he's dirty that's the way it is today they're still ashamed of him because they pile all the dirt that they can upon it call it holy rollers and everything else they can think of nobody does nothing about it Mary says Dirty Feet Wallflower at the party they might have had music they might have had dancing they might have had entertainment they might have had singing but Jesus was a Wallflower at the party let me say this as long as we're here we ought to make him the guest of honor as long as we're here we ought to make him the center of attention as long as we're here we ought to worship him with all of our heart who is he he's the word let the word excite you let it do something in your heart it'll be the word that heals you it'll be the word that changes your body it'll be the word that's what that was what was important it wasn't even the body that he created out of dust but it was the word yes sir it was the word that Elohim brought to Abraham and said in a year at the time of life Sarah's going to have a son and your body's going to be changed back it was the word that come in our day wasn't just a man was a word come in a body of Flesh not in that body that body was Christ Jesus Christ the son of God this man was born of a woman but he was part of the bride God come and manifest himself in but let me go a step further we did last week God didn't just stop there but he wanted to manifest the son of man in you and me that's what a prophet told us look he said invited we asked him to to come for a Revival when he comes we treat him the same way they did there he come and identified himself but nobody wants nothing to do with him see if he could pull some kind of a gimmick or do some kind of a miracle like he did before Pilate the only opportunity he ever had and he asked him wanting to see something done Wanted let's see some sign he ought to have repented you realize Jesus had the power to deliver himself just by doing a sign all all he had to do was stand there and reveal the secrets of Pilot's heart and he knew what pilot was thinking and all he had to do was perform and pilate would have stood there with him and said he's God In the Flesh he is the Son of God all he had to do was do a sign for Herod yeah but he's not a circus clown that's not what he is that's not what church ought to be he's not a show what was he was God the word in flesh and he had a job to do that was die for the sins of the people he had a job to do that was die for my sin and your sin right so he remained silent oh Church pilate said let's see some sign he said he ought to have repented that's what this cruel Hellbound World ought to do tonight is repent of their sins he said that's what these church members ought to do repent of their unbelief stand up for him he's a same yesterday today and forever and he identifies himself just like he did then and the people today take the same at attitude as that Pharisee took same kind of attitude let let him sit after inviting him yet they don't want him they just do it like for manners in other words just to be nice he knows it we done to him today just like they did then instead of washing him washing their reproach away instead of trying to stand up saying you're mistaken it's the word of God made manifest I say it's time we stood up for this message it's time we stood up for one another it's time we stood up for the power of God it's time we stood up for Holiness it's time we stood up for the Holy Ghost right anybody can criticize it's easy where is somebody who will stand up I still believe in the Holy Ghost I still believe in the move of the spirit I still believe in the message of the hour yes it's what he promised he said he would pour out the spirit in the last days we're living in the last days instead of that we're just kind of set back like they did we're afraid to take a stand what if one of them would have raised up and said that's Jesus of Nazareth I believe he's a prophet of God he said you know the reason they didn't do it because they didn't believe he was a prophet right yeah that's something isn't it that's the same thing he's in question about today look how look how preent this is to our age look what they're trying to cast out on brother Brandon being a prophet they're trying to say his prophecy wasn't true even though they got no ground to stand on but that's what they're trying to say they just say well I haven't got nothing to do with him I belong to church there's my pastors all them sitting around there I'm a good person Jesus with dirty feet nobody cared now listen I wonder again how would we receive him and how we would receive him then is how we receive him today right the same way we receive the message of the hour today is the same way we would have received him then there's there's he was just as hidden to them as he is to people today right as he is in you as he is in your wife as he is in your children as he is in the preacher yeah he's just as hidden yeah right just as hidden and and if you would have went back then you would have looked and you would have seen things that maybe we in the scripture we look at it we kind of gloss over it but when you went there you'd have seen him eat and you'd have seen him sleep yeah and you'd have seen him in poverty and you'd have seen him not begin preaching till he was 30 years old yeah and why didn't he do anything earlier there have been all kinds of reasons to criticize that went to raise Lazarus he didn't show up on time he's a bad pastor he's not he don't recognize the people's needs but he was led by the will of God right but you see that what what people are doing there's always going to be something to criticize and I thank God for this church that you're not a criticizing a bunch of people but if you want something to criticize there's lots more I get amused sometimes because if you really knew me you'd have much more to criticize than you do now and I think all of us could say that right because we're human we're wrapped in flesh we got dust on our clothes but look at the dust is Humanity it's Humanity in Genesis 2 chapter or verse 7 the Lord God formed man of the Dust of the ground the dust of the ground dust there is loose dirt when it's wet it becomes mud you could say you're made out of mud J 319 in the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread till thou return to the ground for out of it was thou taken for dust Thou Art to dust shalt thou return again job 10:9 he said job speaking I believe he said remember I beseech thee that thou has made me as the clay and wilt thou bring me into dust again Ecclesiastes 3:20 all go into one place all are of the dust and all turn to dust again our bodies are literally made from dirt right we have a a a constant little tension in our house because I don't want to comb my hair no more you might comb hairs I comb hair it's all right you can laugh at that but but you know I want to cut it as short as I can get it or cut it you know shave it off I can get a wig my wife doesn't want that but you know our we're just dirt that's all we are is dirt whenever you comb your hair you're combing dirt when I was in Togo one of the oddest things I've ever seen and it's just they Tred government tries to give people jobs because there's no jobs and so I saw these women out there in long dresses and head scarves and things that they wear and they're out there on a dirt street with brooms with cornstalks and stuff sticking out the end of it and so it's just like a corn broom like they used to have or whatever they straw broom they're standing with straw brooms and they're all in the street sweeping the street like it's dirt you sweep the dirt off there'll be more dirt and more tomorrow but they just had to have something to do so they swept the dirt and they just kept sweeping the dirt sweeping the dirt and sweeping the dirt and that's what we're doing we're taking care of of dirt we're taking care of 5 fo n inches of dirt some more some less right but it's just dirt we're a bunch brother said the 16 elements of the earth Cosmic light petroleum things put together we were here when God spoke and said let there be our bodies were now listen we're not just dirt we're the same dirt that was in in the ground in the beginning now remember what Genesis 1 said in the beginning God created the heavens and earth period and then it says the Earth was without form and void and darkness lay upon the face of the deep in that Earth we were right we were there our bodies we were there in in in the form of chemicals or whatever that it was and dust and so brother brand said we were there but something a mastermind yeah developed us into what we are now Hallelujah so we can't hate on ourselves too much can we I know you girls sometimes you know young ladies you be just you look in the mirror and say oh no I'm never going to get married just nobody's ever going to like me and everybody's you know everybody's looking down on me and all this stuff and and the truth is you're just dirt all right so you could actually feel a lot worse about yourself but I'll say this is to make you feel better your dirt that a master oh my a master got a hold of and the reason you are what you are and the reason why you can even look pretty the reason why you can even be handsome the reason why you can even ever ever have a hope of having a family is because the master got a hold of you and made something out of the dirt well if he did that to your body don't you believe he could do that to your soul don't you believe he can make a new body for you and change this body in a moment in a twinkling of an eye we get so down on ourselves sometimes I do it too I know what that feels like all it takes is a mirror to depress me and the bigger the mirror is the more depressed I get you know you lie to yourself in the mirror you ever notice that this wasn't in my notes you lie to yourself in the mirror you get to look into the mirror you don't never stand stand like this you know shouldn't have stood that way in front of the cameras but you you you always stand face forward you stand kind of looks pretty good stretch that chin out you know looks pretty good from that angle that's not that's not what everybody else sees what does everybody see dirt see but brother Bram taught us that our bodies were on the earth before there was any like here and so we're made of those 16 elements and our bodies were laying spread out on the earth before there was any type of life on the earth he said and then when God cooled it off and set it over there in his great mind you remember I don't have time to go there this morning but Lucifer walked over the Earth he walked over The Lava the burning lava but it was it was he was claiming it as his possession but God took it away from him he said you can't have that dirt that dirt belongs to me and he made a man out of it and then when God cooled it off and said it over there in his great mind he had something in his mind he was going to do he said there isn't may you take me to record this morning friend there isn't enough power in all hell can ever defeat the purpose of God God will tell you do it anyhow do you believe that today there's none enough power in hell if you got a purpose in your life to serve and you do there ain't enough power in hell that can defeat that purpose amen amen 16 elements found in the dirt bundled together BR said boy you glorify the flesh but that Spirit has a soul in there my brother that's right but your flesh is just dust of the earth like the animal your flesh is no more than an animal he said now and the hear this great theophan he standing there what that great Jehovah God you know what he said I love this he just reached over and got a handful of Adams got a little light and poured it in and went where did he do that before when he made himself a body just reached over and got a handful so that's how you were made you just stepped right into it said come here Gabriel now brother BR was talking about Abraham again he said come here Gabriel that great Archangel went stepping that come here Michael the angel at his right side Oh my he said for step in that God and two angels walk down there in human flesh drank the milk from a cow eat the butter out of the milk eat some cornbread eat the Flesh of the calf two angels and God now brother brand said when they were done with those bodies he just put it back in the dust turned it back to dust and stepped back into another dimension right Oh my he said now what a great hope we have in this great faith we serve tonight the Living God the Jehovah the pillar of fire is with us and I remember a day when people didn't teach that they said well the pillar of fire is with brother brandham but we've come to understand that a prophet taught that the pillar of fire is with us that's what he said the pillar of fire is with us shows himself in power and action and magnify let them take the picture of the same Jehovah the Son of God that came from God went back to God and dwells in his church forever more I hear somebody saying that that well that brother Ben if that pillar fires here why don't we see it it's in you why don't you see it for the same reason Joshua didn't see it what did he see the captain of the host he saw the pillar of fire in a man brother brandom taught him taught us that he said he dwells in his church forever more there he is he dwells in his church forever more Oh my he has our names on his book with a sworn Oath by himself there's no one greater he can swear by that he'll raise us up in the last day that same one he said could just reach and grab a handful of calcium and P as and go there you are again Hallelujah and my name is on his book why do I care how stoop my shoulders are getting how old I get certainly not not a bit of worry he speaks to a man brother Mike we got a brother Mike here but he speaks to brother Mike he said' one of these days bless your heart brother when that great trumpet will come that sound and that Joseph will step forth he's not talking about his son Joseph he's talking about he's talking about Joseph in the Bible what what what was he saying Joseph will step forth Joseph had to step from behind the curtain and reveal himself to his Brethren someday that Joseph will step forth he will say children that's powerful there will be made in in his likeness Young Forever old age has passed away sickness trouble Sorrows has vanished glory be to the Living God dust was on his clothes but it takes the faith of Abraham to see past that excuse me was not extraordinary that dust would be there it was a desert country that was a very ordinary thing for a guy who wasn't God the only extraordinary thing about it is how ordinary it was yes but God always comes that way and I hear the criticism and stuff people say well these preachers always mess things up yeah because they're human but that's still what God uses these people they always mess things up but we don't serve God in Supernatural bodies not yet we serve him in flesh bodies redeemed flesh but still flesh right right and and actually the redeemed part is our soul right that just controls the flesh but the truth is the flesh is still flesh yeah it's still as bad as it ever was right you give it enough Liberty you'll find out and and Paul says I keep under my body I keep it under subjection every day I die daily to make sure that I I I re receive the goal that that I after PR having preached to others I am disapproved myself and God's always come that way listen but if you look at the evidence now now now just hear me this morning people are going to try to always tell you where is the evidence if you look at the evidence that Abraham saw he would say these people couldn't be God it couldn't be Elohim because they must have come from a far country they've been traveling they look like ordinary men the evidence proved scientifically that it wasn't God that just a minute ago but it still was because if there's anybody that can fake evidence it's God now think about it he created Jesus in the womb of Mary and the evidence was that it was an out of wedlock birth the evidence said that he was just a man the evidence said that there was nothing he could do Church the evidence said that he probably was still in the grave and somebody stole his body but we believe he raised again on the third day we believe that he's the son of God we believe he's interceding for us today we believe that why not because of the evidence but because we're Abraham's seed all the evidence showed these folks did not come from Heaven they traveled somewhere on the earth and the dust proved that they come from the earth yes right that's what dust says you come from the earth and the dust was evidence against him being I'm going somewhere Church the dust was evidence against him being from Heaven because dust is only found on the earth yeah and if you were from Heaven why did you pick up that dust yeah come on church we do the same thing to one another right we look at one another and say well if that person was saved come on church it's easy to be critical it's easy to be critical of other people's dust you ever walked in somebody's house that was Dusty don't come in mind if that bothers you I'm sorry Britney I keep Britney rolling all the time just running because we're always going and doing something and if you if if a little dust bothers you you'll have a problem in my house because there's always going to be a little bit of dust there's always something that didn't get dusted as hard as she works but what is it dust is just a natural occurence no matter how hard you work in a church this is my heart this morning church as your pastor I as hard as you work in a church as much as you try to keep everything right and we have this perfect group of young people we got this perfect group of Elders and we got this perfect group of people and all our services are perfect and everything go oh you don't see what goes on behind the scenes you don't know how hard that Deacon worked in the morning to get ready to show up late and we won't say which Deacon but you don't know like you don't see the dust many times times CU we wipe it off real clean you know and come up here to church but every one of us has it and I think sometimes I have people tell me they say well you know message culture is so you know it's this way and I feel like I don't fit in with message culture well that's not what we're trying to fit in we're trying to be children of God and children of God got dust on their clothes but they believe in Holiness children of God got dust in their clothes but they believe the message of the hour children of God got dust on their feet and they get dirty but that's why we go to church to be Washed by the Water of the word if we were perfect we wouldn't need the house of God what do we need we need the dust wiped off of us oh God wash me this morning let me stay under the Fountain of the word to be washed from all of these things yes and maybe when we're critical that's the moment our dust is the worst that's evidence of Earthly Origins it is Abraham you might have asked him if this is Elohim why do you have to wash his feet why in the world is he eating cornbread and milk doesn't he have better things to do like the people who got the upset if their Pastor because the pastor was all the time visiting the sick said never spends any time in study so he started just studying all the time and said well he never spends any time visiting the sick why is there dust on his clothes this is important we don't want to get discouraged by the dust yeah see there was dust on the prophet's clothes the prophet that come in our day he was human sometimes he misspoke or said things in the wrong order he had a wife and children he worried about things he was nervous every seven years he had a a case what he called the blues come over him but God did more through that body than he had done through any body of Flesh that he'd ever used on the earth yeah right that's the truth h brother Bram even said he did more in my Ministry than he did in his own when he was on the earth brother brand didn't say that as a humble brag he said that because it was true but Jesus said to John he said what went you out to see what did you go to church to see what went you out to see a prophet he said more than a prophet right yeah for this is he of whom it was written behold I send my messenger before thy face which shall prepare thy way before thee verily I say unto you among them that are born of women there is not risen a greater than John the Baptist notwithstanding he that is least in the Kingdom of Heaven is greater than he why because greater is he that receives than he who sent right we're servants greater is the congregation than the preacher that's the truth right because we're God could use us and throw us aside but he got a message he wants to get across right greater is the congregation than the preacher greater is the one that's that's sent to than the one that is sent he said not me this is just a vessel he can use he said it's the same angel that met Abraham but he said it's not me it's just a vessel he can use you're a vessel he can use he said if you have faith and believe yes again he said he went out there and said there's something about that man I've heard that voice before I know he's got dust all over his clothes and things he's sitting there rubbing his face my brother BR was talk he's telling us something he's sitting there rubbing his face and looking around like that but I'm telling you I know that voice brother Bron would rub his face when the angel anointing was there cuz he got numb and and he he said looking around like that but I'm telling you I know that voice cuz it ain't an uncertain sound cuz I heard it 25 years ago and honey we've been trusted all this time to believe and there's something about that man I don't know why but there's something about him look again he said I pray father you'll wake people up to let them know we're living like a modern Sodom and gomorah granted Lord that they'll see that that angel that was promised to visit through human flesh he said Lord we know that that angel is a messenger from Heaven which is the Holy Ghost it's him that wants to work through us the will of God to call the church why brother Brandon was part of the Bride he worked through that body in a way he don't have to use our bodies that way but he wants to use our bodies for something yes are you with me so far he said he wants to work through us the will of God to call the church Grant it Lord send him again tonight send that great Elohim that come down in dust and made himself known because he could talk to man through the dust use the dust that's in here Lord oh Church could we maybe raise our hands to him and say Lord use me use this dust use the dust that's in here Lord that's been consecrated to you this Sanctified dust by the blood of Jesus use them Lord if there be an unbeliever here Lord he said let them see the hour is approaching they see it in the newspapers they hear it on radios and televisions now may they see the sign of God that he's calling his church giving you that final last final last sign that you would receive he said we've had healings and speaking with tongues and miracles and so forth but that visit is what we're looking for tonight he said granted in the name of Jesus Christ sorry he said I took so long brother sister I'm just a lump of clay don't you pay any attention to me but you listen to what I'm saying what's he saying don't P any attention to the dust but listen to what I'm saying the coming of the Lord is Drawing Near again he said friends don't look to me I'm your brother don't pay no attention me because I'm just a mortal I have to die like everybody else don't you listen to me but listen to what I've said on what I've said is the message don't pay any attention to the messenger watch the message keep your eyes not on the messenger but on the message what it said that's the thing to look at so we wipe the dirt off the messenger because we know the message is God message is from God you see it we're not worshiping the messenger that's not what we do do we do wipe the dirt off we pay way too much attention to dust see the Bible says I'm just taking my time this morning but I've got a few more minutes and we'll close looks like we'll be on time the Bible says like as a father pth his children so the Lord pth them that fear Him He has compassion see he sees past the Dust listen what he says verse 14 for he knows our frame and what that word frame means is is our method of construction why he did it yeah he knows how we were made he remember that we are dust he remembers that we are you say that's good I'm glad that God sees and knows that I'm dust because I make mistakes I think all of us can say Amen to that I'm glad he sees where do you realize he's called to do the same thing for one another 1 Peter 38 finally be all of One mind having compassion one of another love as Brethren be pitiful be courteous not rendering evil for evil or railing for railing but contrary wise blessing knowing that are you are there un to called that you should inherit a blessing I don't care how much religion you got I don't care how much of this message you know or how many quotes you can quote if you treat people badly yeah you don't have a revelation of this if you treat your enemies rudely you don't you don't do what he said right and we're all dust we do sometimes we're rude sometimes we mess up sometimes but even our enemies we shouldn't but especially our Brethren our sisters he said Brethren you've been called unto Liberty but use not Liberty for an occasion to the flesh but by love serve one another for all the law is fulfilled in one word even in this Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself again Galatians 61 and and and that was from Peter and then Galatians 5 in Galatians 61 Brethren if a man be overtaken in a fault now why did Paul write that CU he knew men would be overtaken in faults ye which are spiritual how many are believe that you're spiritual no that's kind of a trick question isn't it but I think we if we're Christians we ought to be able to raise our hands to that right but you that are spiritual and I know a lot of people call themselves spiritual and count themselves as spiritual those are people are usually troubled because they know everything but you that are really spiritual here's how to act restore such a one in the spirit of meekness and and meekness doesn't mean to just give up give in to whatever everything they want meekness means to have yourself in self-control considering thyself lest thou also be tempted because you're dust too bear one another's burdens and so fulfill the law of Christ listen when the Ark of the Covenant was carried into the public all you saw was Badger skins they just covered it up so we think about the ark you know you've seen pictures of the Ark going places and you see the ark that's actually not true you never saw the ark when it traveled Moses said throw a blanket on it put the skin on it right just like it a skin was hanging in the Tabernacle the skin went with it wherever it went so they didn't actually see the ark but they knew the ark was there so the oh my it was God deity the the shakina presence of God hid the glory of God hid from the people he said that old Badger skin what did it do it hid the glory of God from the people the badger skins even people couldn't see it because it was a skin that held it the skin was the glory of God was behind the skin Oh church we can only see that Jared the glory of God is behind your skin all the little girls said amen sorry buddy but the truth is that's all of us right the glory of God is behind our [Music] skin Oh church if we're born again the glory the shikina glory wouldn't it have been awesome to walk into the presence of the shikina of God and see that great Pillar of Fire hanging there and feel the presence the atmosphere as you walked into the Tabernacle wouldn't have been awesome but only a high priest was allowed to go in once a year but that same Glory yeah is in the heart of the believer today brother BR said now the glory of God is behind your skin he didn't just say my skin though it was behind his skin but he said your skin the glory of God is behind your skin that's right and the Traditions don't see it it's inside the veil where his word was what was on the inside of that skin back there the old Badger skin which there was no Beauty we should desire it and when it was made flesh and dwelt Among Us it was still no Beauty we should desire it he said and now the same thing is today there's nothing in a man or a woman that can be desired it's what's in behind there that's what it is we're looking at the wrong thing Church you're looking at the wrong thing in the young people you're looking at the wrong thing in the elders you're looking at the wrong thing in the pastor look at what's behind the skin it's what's in behind there that's what it is when you say that fellow I know he used to be a drunker he used to do this he said I don't care what he used to do what's hid behind that skin what is behind there that's what counts I don't care where you come from from where you've been what's behind there huh I'm not going to count that you coming to church and doing whatever you want to do and I'll preach at that you going to live a sinful lifestyle and claim to be a Christian and have a bad attitude and do all that you'll get preached at he said how do you know I may not even know about it but you'll get preached at because the word will correct that but but you I don't care what you've done if you've been filled with the Holy Ghost and God has cleansed your heart there's Glory his glory is behind the skin and it's incumbent on me who doesn't have the ability like God God has the ability to forget that put it out of his mind I don't but it's incumbent on me to act like God and say what the word says and say it's over what's behind there is what counts he said that's what the people is blinded the skin blinds the people they say I remember when that woman used to I know what she used to but what about now and the skins that was once on the badger but now it's hiding the glory of God got it housed behind it it was on an animal but now it's housing the glory of God listen he said and so can your skin be changed tonight to be made a housing place for God God dwelling in how many want that this morning and as we come down to a close how many want that God dwelling in humanity wants to change your skin until it's like the badger skin it just covering up God oh my still the same skin it ever was but it's changed from just being covering a badger to cover in the almighty God yes we need to be careful Church listen how we treat one another is how we treat God and and how critical we are of each other some it's easy to criticize I want to say this when's the last time you got down and prayed for that person I guarantee you this that person that you criticize and and I expect you especially with our young people it takes a whole church kind of to keep them in line and we got to do that sometimes you got to say something i' rather you say something and then let it go and then then it becomes a problem but I'll say this make sure you understand what's behind it what's behind that skin when you go to criticizing people make sure you understand what's behind that skin is this a Christian are they really a Believer maybe they're messed up but are they a believer that don't countenance to sin but there's something in there and and I guarantee you this if we start praying for people instead of criticizing people there'd be a difference in this church if we just pray for if all people would do and I think most of you do I believe all of you do but if all you did would just pray for your pastor and S criticize it would make a difference in the services if all you did is pray for the musician instead of criticize them it's a hard job right if all you did was pray for them instead of criticize make a difference if all you did was pray for the young people instead of criticize them and make a difference if all you did was oh church if all you did was get down on your knees and I pray to God that we could do that prayer makes a difference it still changes things but it's easier to criticize I want to say this this morning as a musicians come the god of William brandom is not in that flesh body anymore how can you say that because I went by the grave the other day that body is in the Tomb but the god of William brandham didn't die we saw his grave we saw the Tabernacle closed I went by the voice of God I hadn't been there I think in 18 years and I walked up and there's nothing going on that I could see places sitting empty and the sign and they have their reasons I believe they're changing the name on the sign but the sign was painted over and I walked up and knocked on the door and a lady come very nice and told me they were closed but that's not where God is I thought deeply about this this week if this church closes tomorrow God won't die listen he said if God is in your heart you'll want to assemble yourselves together that word lives that word lives the god of William brandom is not dead somewhere in Africa there's a little church made out of sticks I've been there I've been to one out of out of hundreds or even thousands of those little churches in Egypt there's a few Believers meeting in an old Coptic church I've been there in the Philippines they sit on hard wooden pews I've said in those in China they meet in the underground Church in India they sit in buildings with no roof I've preached to them over the internet but the god of Elijah Hallelujah is still with his people yes he hasn't died he's still the same yesterday today and forever he's still here this morning and I want to declare that God to you as Paul stood there at the Tomb of the or or or the the altar to the unknown God he said you worshiping a God you don't even know just in case there's a God that he said I want to declare the god you don't know to you he said I want to tell you there's a living God I want to tell you God never died I want to tell you he's the same yesterday today and forever I'm here to tell you he lives in young people he lives in Elders he lives in the deacons he lives in pastors there's somebody that's got God in them if you don't have God inside of you today there's a there's an opport opportunity to house God in your mortal flesh somewhere in Hardy Arkansas there's a congregation with dust on their clothes and others might look at Hardy and say what good could come out of Hardy's kind of like being from Nazareth but their only desire is to entertain Elohim that's my desire this morning I didn't come here to entertain you I didn't come here here just to make people feel better about themselves though I hope you do that's not why I came I came to entertain Elohim he didn't die in Jeffersonville he he's not in a grave in Jerusalem but he's the same yesterday today and forever and that God I declare to you this morning and I challenge you to see past the dusty clothes and see him coming oh church if you could only grab a glimpse of it this morning I know in a meeting many times we get excited and things and and we begin to we to see it we can see it because of the excitement see it this morning despite the lack of excitement can you see him I challenge you to see Pastor Dusty clothes and see him coming we have heard the shout we we know his voice and the trumpet is about to sound can you see can you see the king is coming can you see David is about to sit on his throne can you see there's young people who make many mistakes but they believe God is on their side can you see that there's Elders that maybe fell many times but now they're serving God with all their heart can you see people delivered from adultery can you see people delivered from from fornication can you believe can you see people delivered from alcohol can you see people delivered from lust I say you're looking at one I say you're looking at a group of people who've been delivered can you see Pastor dust enough to see God [Music] can you see him in a Sunday morning service because your expectation is what to make the service can you see him despite the quirks of the Dust can you see God walking in front coming to you say God I believe you have a message for me today I believe this word is going to change my body can we still see a church can we still see it I I confess I was a little disappointed there's not as much to see in Jeffersonville as there was when I was a kid when everything was operating and everything was busy was a little disappointed but I've never been disappointed in the god of Elijah I've never been disappointed in the fact that he still comes by my way he still heals the sick he still raises the dead he's the same yesterday today and forever you love him with all your heart amen let's bow our heads together excuse me for being emotional this morning but it just struck my heart can you see him can you can you look past yourself cuz sometimes that's the person you criticize the most is yourself can you look past yourself look past the dust see Christ how would we treat one another how much grace would we give one another how much would we warn each other if we did see something say brother I don't want to see you go that way how much would we pray for one another if we can really see the glory of the almighty God in Dusty clothes just Travelers traveling through there God in flesh oh Hallelujah if you need prayer the altar is open today but let's just pray to him together now Heavenly Father Lord we want to see you Hallelujah we want to see Pastor Dust We want to know that you're here and we believe you are Lord I pray you'd help me God sometimes as a pastor I get critical of the world the way things are going it's easy to get critical of a church critical of people because they're human they don't always meet your expectations but Lord we believe believe that you're still God you've never changed we thank you for that Lord I realize Lord that I don't always meet people's expectations but I'm glad you're in love with me Lord I'm glad you love me so much that you called me before the foundation of the earth and ultimately lord it's because of predestination as me and brother Joel were talking the other day and and he and he told me that really what it is is predestination and I begin to think about that thought that's true where would I be without predes how could I ever come to the placing of a son as I was predestined to do it I pray you'd Grant it Lord I pray you'd help us to mature help us to grow up help us to love one another help us to see past the dust Lord and see you clearly among us we pray in Jesus name hallelujah
