[36:51] we're believing
[36:53] that you're going to do something for us
[36:54] you're going to speak directly to
[36:56] whatever situation that we're going
[36:57] through
[36:58] i pray you'd move me out of the way and

[37:02] from your word we ask it in jesus name
[37:05] amen amen
[37:09] you love the lord tonight man i
[37:12] apologize i know i was a little bit late
[37:14] coming out i
[37:15] got talking and and wasn't prepared to
[37:19] come out
[37:20] but uh the lord's got everything in in
[37:23] his hands doesn't he
[37:25] amen that's one thing you can do to make
[37:27] me late
[37:28] is get me to talk
[37:31] i want you to turn with me revelations
[37:33] chapter 5 and verse 1.
[37:37] i embarrass my wife so bad when i do
[37:39] that i've only done that
[37:40] two or three times in all the years that
[37:42] i've been preaching
[37:43] and she reminds me on occasion of those
[37:46] two or three times
[37:48] revelations chapter 5 and verse 1
[37:52] isn't it good to be in the house of the
[37:53] lord
[37:55] then we have some good services on
[37:57] saturday and sunday
[37:59] amen i enjoyed that so much
[38:02] and and then you know on wednesday
[38:04] nights it seems like that
[38:06] the devil's been fighting us with
[38:07] weather and it looked like we were gonna
[38:09] have some bad weather again and
[38:11] two times in a row when we're gonna have
[38:13] bad weather it's just kind of bypassed
[38:15] us or
[38:15] went through before church time and i'm
[38:17] so thankful for that
[38:19] i believe that that means that god meant
[38:21] for you to be here and me to be here and
[38:23] us to have church
[38:25] so we're going to hear from the word
[38:26] tonight because we believe that the word
[38:29] is
[38:29] is always good and and god's got
[38:32] something for us revelations chapter 5
[38:35] and verse 1 and i saw in the right hand
[38:38] of him that said on the throne a book
[38:39] written within and on the backside
[38:41] sealed with seven seals and i saw a
[38:44] strong angel proclaiming with a loud
[38:46] voice who was worthy to open the book
[38:48] and to loose the seals thereof and no
[38:50] man in heaven
[38:52] nor on earth neither under the earth was
[38:54] able to open the book neither to look
[38:56] there on
[38:57] and i wept much because no man was found
[39:00] worthy to open and to read the book
[39:01] neither to look thereon
[39:03] and one of the elders saith unto me weep
[39:05] not behold the lion of the tribe of
[39:07] judah the root of david
[39:09] have prevailed to open the book and
[39:12] loose the seven seals thereof and we
[39:13] heard about that how he prevailed on
[39:15] sunday
[39:17] amen he prevailed he fought the battle
[39:19] and he won
[39:21] amen he prevailed to open the book and
[39:22] to loose the seven seals thereof
[39:25] and i be held and low in the midst of
[39:29] i beheld and low in the midst of the
[39:31] throne and of the four beasts and in the
[39:32] midst of the elders to the lamb as it
[39:34] had been slain
[39:35] having seven horns and seven eyes which
[39:38] are the seven spirits of god
[39:40] sent forth into all the earth and he
[39:42] came and took the book out of the right
[39:44] hand
[39:46] of him that set upon the throne i pray
[39:48] the lord would add his blessing to the
[39:50] word you may be seated
[39:53] i'm going to begin tonight it doesn't
[39:55] mean i'll be doing it every wednesday
[39:57] night
[39:58] but from time to time until we're
[40:01] through it
[40:02] i'm going to begin studying on the
[40:04] message called the breach between the
[40:06] seven church ages and seven seals and i
[40:10] want to eventually get to the seven
[40:12] seals and
[40:13] uh but this is maybe a little bit
[40:14] different than what we would normally do
[40:16] on a wednesday night but we've been
[40:19] in revival and we we've we've i'm so
[40:22] happy to have
[40:23] a revival in our hearts aren't you glad
[40:25] to have a revival in your heart
[40:27] but we're going to just kind of study
[40:29] the message tonight and
[40:31] and look at it in maybe a little bit
[40:32] different way than what we're used to i
[40:34] want to look at it in its context
[40:36] and the reason my reason for doing this
[40:38] is because i've found that myself
[40:41] that i get i take brother branham out of
[40:43] context sometimes
[40:45] okay and that's an admission now you can
[40:48] take that and run with it and
[40:50] call me a false teacher or whatever but
[40:52] we do that and it's not always bad
[40:55] okay because sometimes you'll use a
[40:56] quote that's a good quote but it's not
[40:58] really the way that
[40:59] he intended to do it for it to be used
[41:03] it's taken out of context and you all
[41:05] know some of you are old enough to
[41:07] remember quote books
[41:09] when we had quote books and you could
[41:10] take a quote book and say you had a
[41:12] quote book on christmas
[41:14] and you could take a quote book
[41:16] anti-christmas and another quote book
[41:19] christmas and and take them in and
[41:22] you could just use those quotes and it
[41:25] would be all good quotes
[41:27] one way or the other just taken out of
[41:28] context
[41:30] right and and very few people are able
[41:33] to get past their own biases
[41:35] far enough to just present it and so we
[41:38] want to
[41:39] always present the whole council of god
[41:41] and that's why i try to
[41:42] come to you as a pastor i can't always
[41:45] be evangelistic i can't always be a
[41:47] teacher i have to be all of those things
[41:49] but i can't always be
[41:51] just one of those things right and so
[41:54] i have a responsibility to declare to
[41:56] you the whole
[41:57] counsel of god and in doing that i
[42:01] one of the ways that i've done it over
[42:03] the years is just to take brother
[42:04] branham's message
[42:05] and go through a sermon and read to you
[42:08] out of that sermon although we don't
[42:10] read the whole thing
[42:11] but most of it and
[42:14] give you the context of why brother
[42:16] branham saying those things and and
[42:18] brother random will take what seems like
[42:20] a red herring many times in those
[42:21] sermons and i encourage you to listen to
[42:23] the tape
[42:24] because brother random will take what
[42:26] seems to be a side
[42:28] road and talk about something that's not
[42:31] with the sermon with his text but if
[42:34] you'll
[42:35] wait for it you'll find it does apply
[42:39] and so those things are important too
[42:41] and a lot of times those things get
[42:43] get left out there's a lot of times that
[42:46] and we don't want to hear about nuance
[42:48] we don't want to hear about
[42:50] uh that we want to get right straight to
[42:52] the point right
[42:53] but the truth is the point isn't always
[42:57] sometimes what's around it matters
[43:01] and so we want to make sure we get all
[43:03] of it now
[43:04] i know that the question would be asked
[43:06] and i want to deal with this and just
[43:08] talk to you about this and i won't be
[43:09] doing this
[43:09] again but just to kind of as we start
[43:11] this
[43:13] why not just play the tape well
[43:17] brother branham taught us how to run our
[43:19] services
[43:22] and i think he did a good job with that
[43:25] and abstinent i don't have a district
[43:27] president or somewhere telling me how
[43:29] what to do and how to run the services
[43:31] i look at what brother branham said
[43:33] about that
[43:34] and in church order brother branham
[43:36] talks about how pastors to be in his
[43:38] study and
[43:39] getting quiet and i could i got really
[43:41] quiet tonight i had plenty of time in
[43:43] the study and
[43:44] but he talks about that and and before
[43:46] he comes out to preach and then in
[43:48] church order he says come out
[43:49] greet his audience that's what i've done
[43:51] to you turn to his book and say tonight
[43:54] we're reading from the bible
[43:56] afterward he makes it up we're reading
[43:57] from the bible and it's a good thing
[43:58] sometimes if you say in respect to the
[44:00] word of god let's stand to our feet
[44:01] while we read the word
[44:03] he said from eight to about a quarter
[44:05] till nine and
[44:06] that would be if the server started at 7
[44:08] 30. so
[44:10] he said just somewhere between 30 and 45
[44:13] minutes
[44:14] now this is after you've read the
[44:16] scripture
[44:18] i'm giving myself plenty of time here
[44:21] right so he says from 30 between 30 and
[44:24] 45 minutes lay that word in there just
[44:26] as the holy ghost gives it to you
[44:29] right and so he says see just like that
[44:32] just place it right in there the way he
[44:33] says do it under the anointing
[44:36] and so for me i'll just take his word on
[44:38] that
[44:40] he never told me anything different how
[44:42] to how to run a church service and
[44:45] and the scripture is silent on that but
[44:47] we know that in the scripture it says
[44:48] preach
[44:49] the word right be instant in season and
[44:52] out of season so
[44:53] that's an authority that we have and
[44:55] jesus told us to preach the gospel now
[44:58] uh you know you say well brother branham
[45:00] was just saying that
[45:01] he didn't really believe that well what
[45:03] can we believe about what brother
[45:04] branham says
[45:06] brother brown uses this argument he said
[45:08] if i don't believe in going to church
[45:09] why do i have church
[45:12] i think i could use that same argument
[45:13] if brother branham didn't believe in
[45:14] preachers why did he
[45:16] have one in his own church
[45:20] so if i don't believe in going to church
[45:23] why do i have church so he did believe
[45:24] in it now
[45:26] and but it's not just the minister or
[45:28] the pastor that has something to say
[45:31] every one of us has something to say
[45:33] something that we need to say
[45:36] does that make sense that no one else
[45:37] can say for us
[45:39] i have to say peter had to say thou art
[45:42] the christ the son of the living god
[45:44] peter had to say that he was the only
[45:46] one who could say that
[45:48] that way in order to receive the
[45:50] blessing from that you're the only one
[45:52] that can say
[45:53] i want to be baptized i want to give my
[45:55] heart to christ i repent of my sins
[45:57] you have to say that right and brother
[46:00] branham said how can a man come along
[46:02] and say the holy man is the pope
[46:04] the holy man is the bishop he said the
[46:05] holy man is christ the holy spirit in us
[46:08] he said how can you say the laity has no
[46:11] word to say
[46:12] now we're taking that even a step
[46:13] further and say well the preacher
[46:14] doesn't have anything to say
[46:16] but he said how can you say the laity
[46:18] has no word to say
[46:19] each one of you has something to say
[46:22] each one of you has got a work to do
[46:24] each one of you has got to carry a
[46:26] message
[46:29] if you can't do that with words then do
[46:31] it the way you live isn't that right
[46:35] i have been encouraged in in studying
[46:38] the sermons this way gives us the
[46:39] opportunity to
[46:41] compare with scripture and also with
[46:43] things brother branham says in other
[46:44] places
[46:46] especially after the opening of the
[46:47] seals i'm i've been encouraged lately to
[46:49] see revival fire especially among the
[46:51] young people i'm
[46:52] so encouraged by that i like to see the
[46:54] the move of the spirit of the lord
[46:56] i i enjoy that so much we need that
[46:58] atmosphere we need that presence of god
[47:03] and yet at the same time we've got to
[47:05] keep our balance in the word
[47:08] because feelings will come and go
[47:11] and and again i fully support every
[47:14] feeling that we have i wish we
[47:15] every service we had a jericho march
[47:17] around the church and just
[47:18] shouted and hollered and and and because
[47:21] i believe the words worth that i
[47:23] i believe jesus is worthy of our praise
[47:25] and
[47:26] i believe the word is is good and and we
[47:29] should rejoice in the word but feelings
[47:30] will come and go sometimes you won't
[47:32] feel like shouting
[47:33] sometimes you won't feel like speaking
[47:35] in tongues sometimes you won't hardly be
[47:36] in the spirit at all but the word is
[47:38] still true
[47:40] aren't you glad of that the word is true
[47:43] when you're at home and you've had a
[47:44] spat with your wife
[47:45] or your husband whatever that it is the
[47:47] word is true when you make a mistake
[47:49] when
[47:49] something goes wrong the word is still
[47:51] true
[47:52] and and so we want to make sure we stay
[47:55] with the word and and
[47:56] believe all that the word says and so
[47:58] brother branham says this this is the
[48:00] last
[48:01] quote that i'll read before we get into
[48:03] this but
[48:04] brother branham says there's one side
[48:05] that's highly intellectual cold and
[48:07] indifferent they deny
[48:08] everything there he said and the others
[48:10] get on the other side
[48:11] on the other side with a radical bunch
[48:13] of an emotion and deny the word
[48:15] so it's okay to have all the emotion
[48:17] just stay with the word too right don't
[48:20] don't leave the word with your emotion
[48:23] but the real true church
[48:24] he said stays right in the middle of the
[48:26] road he said now if you notice it's got
[48:28] the bible knowledge of what god said
[48:31] and spiritual enough to be warm in its
[48:34] heart
[48:35] isn't that what you want don't you want
[48:37] to be warm in your heart
[48:39] amen because if you're not all the
[48:41] preaching and teaching in the world
[48:42] couldn't make it
[48:44] work
[48:47] now there's kind of give you a little
[48:51] background on the breach brother random
[48:52] uses the word breach quite often in the
[48:54] message
[48:55] and it's the act in webster's dictionary
[48:58] in 1828 if you ever want a good
[49:00] definition go back
[49:01] to webster 1828 because definitions have
[49:04] changed over time but
[49:06] that original webster's dictionary was a
[49:08] great dictionary
[49:10] in the english language and he used a
[49:11] lot of biblical terms
[49:14] and especially for the king james
[49:15] version it works very well
[49:17] but the word breach is the act of
[49:19] breaking a state of being broken a
[49:21] rupture a break or a gap
[49:24] it's the gap between the ages and the
[49:26] seals the breach
[49:29] but it also speaks of redemption it's
[49:32] beautiful if you think about it because
[49:34] there was a breach between god and man a
[49:37] gap
[49:38] and somebody the lamb had to step into
[49:41] that gap
[49:42] and when he steps out to take the book
[49:44] and he's he's stepping into that gap
[49:46] he's bridging the gap
[49:48] that's what brings us back to god see
[49:51] redemption couldn't stop at the cross it
[49:53] had to be completed
[49:54] redemption had to be completed and
[49:56] tonight we're living
[49:58] in the time of the fullness of
[49:59] redemption during his claiming work and
[50:02] so and so that's the hour that we live
[50:04] in only christ could stand in that
[50:06] breach and make up that gap
[50:08] amen no brother branham preaches five
[50:12] sermons
[50:13] from watch night 1960 through
[50:16] june 1961 dealing with that gap or that
[50:19] breach
[50:20] and that's revelation chapter four uh
[50:23] parts one two and three
[50:25] and then he preached revelation chapter
[50:27] five one and two you'll find that when
[50:29] he preaches revelation chapter five
[50:31] which is the same material or the same
[50:33] scripture he uses in the breach
[50:35] he's caught up in something and that was
[50:37] that deity spirit
[50:38] and so brother brahma is dealing with
[50:40] that in revelation chapter five one and
[50:42] two i think the message used to be
[50:43] called
[50:44] a bruised serpent but it now it's called
[50:47] revelation chapter five
[50:49] one and two now he's dealing with that
[50:52] controversy that's going on i'm glad
[50:54] that he did
[50:55] he then preached 70th week of daniel in
[50:58] august 1961.
[51:00] he then preached is this the sign of the
[51:01] in sir in december 30th 1962
[51:05] which brother random references over and
[51:07] over and over again is one of the major
[51:08] turning points in his ministry was is
[51:11] this the sign of the in
[51:13] sir which sometimes he'll call what time
[51:14] is it sirs
[51:17] now in in the breach we won't read the
[51:20] first few paragraphs but if you get
[51:22] into that and i'm not going to keep you
[51:23] very long tonight because i know you're
[51:24] sitting here thinking man if he's going
[51:26] to read the breach i'm not going to do
[51:27] that tonight
[51:29] but i'm just going we're just going to
[51:30] barely dip our toe in the water now
[51:33] when brother branham preaches the breach
[51:34] he starts talking about
[51:36] he tells a story about the sword coming
[51:37] in his hand
[51:39] you remember the story and what that
[51:41] what when that happened it was god's
[51:43] answer to brother branham's concern
[51:46] about these things that he
[51:47] he understood from is this the sign of
[51:49] the answer
[51:51] so he references that sermon and he he
[51:54] says
[51:54] it could be one of two things it could
[51:56] be my death it could be
[51:58] the coming of this seventh angel's
[52:01] ministry
[52:02] and we found out what it was now with
[52:04] the benefit of hindsight we can look at
[52:05] that and see what it was
[52:08] he's still with me tonight so
[52:12] it was god's answer to his concern now
[52:15] and so the the sword in the hand was the
[52:18] word of god now
[52:19] it had to be held with a strong hand of
[52:21] faith so brother branham
[52:23] reads the text that i wrote read to you
[52:26] tonight
[52:27] and then in 1963 on march 17th that
[52:30] evening i remember that morning he's
[52:33] preached crisis
[52:34] he's preached um hit god hidden in
[52:37] simplicity
[52:38] uh and so we we know that he's preparing
[52:41] them for something and then that night
[52:42] he preaches the breach now
[52:45] he says this seventh seal book is
[52:47] revealed at the time
[52:49] of the seven thunders of revelation 10.
[52:52] now so much of what we believe in the
[52:55] message
[52:56] comes from these statements in the first
[52:59] part
[53:00] of the message to breach a prophet
[53:05] when he says something it means
[53:06] something
[53:08] so he says the seven seal book is
[53:10] revealed at the time
[53:11] of the seven thunders of revelation 10.
[53:13] he immediately ties the two together
[53:15] he said now if you're marking it down
[53:17] let's turn to revelation 10 just a
[53:18] moment so you get an understanding
[53:20] before we get into it
[53:21] now this is at the end time and he reads
[53:24] revelation 10 1 and i saw
[53:26] another mighty angel come down from
[53:28] heaven clothed with the cloud
[53:29] a rainbow was upon his head
[53:33] he said if you notice that's christ
[53:36] because he in the old testament was
[53:38] called the angel of the covenant
[53:40] and he is directly coming to the jews
[53:43] now
[53:44] for the church's finish he said and his
[53:47] face was as it were the sun
[53:49] and his feet as pillars of fire he said
[53:51] you remember that angel in revelation 1
[53:53] the same thing
[53:55] he said angel is a messenger and he's
[53:57] the messenger to israel
[53:58] the church has been raptured he said see
[54:01] now or
[54:02] fixing to be raptured but the realm
[54:03] corrects himself the church is fixing to
[54:06] be raptured
[54:08] he said he comes for his church
[54:12] so i was taught growing up that this was
[54:16] the third coming of christ but that's
[54:17] not what brother branham says
[54:19] it says the church is fixing to be
[54:20] raptured
[54:22] now watch revelation 10 2 and he had in
[54:25] his hand a little book
[54:27] open now it's one of the most important
[54:30] things that we believe
[54:32] he had in his hand a little book open
[54:35] he said now here it was closed here and
[54:38] sealed and here it's open
[54:42] and so he's from revelation 5 to
[54:44] revelation 10 something happened
[54:47] all right it was closed here and sealed
[54:50] here it's open now
[54:54] both those it's closed and then opened
[54:57] during the ministry
[54:59] during the sounding and we'll get to a
[55:01] little bit later of that seventh angel's
[55:04] message
[55:06] it's closed and open during the sounding
[55:08] of the seventh angel's message
[55:10] if it's closed and then open then all
[55:12] seven seals have to be revealed
[55:15] right or else you've got the sounding of
[55:17] the message not over and brother branham
[55:19] has to come back
[55:21] that's right there's no way because it's
[55:23] either open or it's not
[55:27] i believe it's open tonight and that
[55:30] bible become a new book like he told us
[55:32] amen he said so here it's open it's been
[55:36] opened he said since the time of that
[55:37] ceiling we're getting into
[55:38] tonight now the book is open a little
[55:40] book in his hand it was open
[55:42] he said oh how the sun is pillar she
[55:44] said wait just a minute let me start
[55:45] back here and read
[55:47] and he goes back he said he had his hand
[55:48] a little book open he said his right
[55:50] foot upon the sea
[55:51] his left foot on the earth and he cried
[55:54] with a loud voice as when a lion roars
[55:57] roareth now he said we know he is the
[56:01] lion of the tribe
[56:02] of judah over here he's the lamb
[56:05] so he's pointing out something else
[56:06] first he says over here it's closed over
[56:08] here it's open
[56:09] over here he's the lamb but here he's
[56:11] the lion
[56:13] amen amen oh church we're getting awful
[56:17] close
[56:18] brother brown says in sermons that we're
[56:20] getting close somewhere he changes from
[56:22] lamb to lion
[56:23] during this time right of the sounding
[56:26] of the seventh angel's message now
[56:29] he said when he cried seven thunders
[56:31] uttered their voices he's reading the
[56:32] scripture
[56:34] now john was commissioned to write what
[56:36] he saw
[56:38] so the apostle and prophet picked up his
[56:40] pen
[56:41] to write it and when the seven thunders
[56:42] were out of their voices i was about to
[56:44] write
[56:45] i heard a voice from heaven saying unto
[56:46] me seal up those things
[56:48] which the seven thunders uttered and
[56:50] write them not
[56:52] he said now that's what we don't know
[56:55] that's yet to be revealed
[56:57] now remember this is sunday night
[57:01] it's about to be revealed
[57:04] right he said that's what we don't know
[57:06] that's yet to be revealed it's not in
[57:08] the holy script
[57:09] what them thunders say now i have to
[57:11] diverge a little bit and i told you we'd
[57:13] be comparing some things that brother
[57:14] branham said later
[57:16] with this because we need to understand
[57:18] that if it's yet to be revealed at that
[57:20] time
[57:22] was it revealed during his ministry and
[57:25] brother branham i think
[57:26] says that pretty emphatically in the
[57:27] fourth seal
[57:29] he tells us this he said that's the way
[57:31] the church ages and seals and all the
[57:32] rest of it when anybody thinks he has
[57:34] those seven thunders
[57:35] if it don't compare with the rest of the
[57:37] word there is something wrong
[57:40] so those seven thunders have to compare
[57:41] with the word even though he said it's
[57:43] not a holy script
[57:44] but he said it has to compare with the
[57:46] word
[57:47] he said it's got to come thus saith the
[57:50] lord
[57:51] for this is the book you've heard it
[57:53] said this is brother branham's quote
[57:54] book
[57:55] right it's the bible this is the book
[57:58] this is the revelation of jesus christ
[58:01] in its entirety right so the thunders
[58:05] have to come from they have to match up
[58:07] with that now
[58:09] in the unveiling of god brother branham
[58:11] talks about that and someone had come to
[58:13] him said brother branham you would have
[58:14] the authority with your ministry
[58:16] to come and write another bible and
[58:18] brother branham says
[58:20] he talks about that and he said it may
[58:22] be that i had the authority but it would
[58:23] be wrong
[58:25] he talked about that he said because you
[58:27] can't add to or take away and then he
[58:28] says this he said it's
[58:29] all revealed in there it's all revealed
[58:33] in there and the seven seals
[58:35] opened up the revelation of what that
[58:38] was
[58:41] right the seven seals opened up the
[58:43] revelation of what that's
[58:44] that was he said that's what it was
[58:48] well that's pretty simple isn't it
[58:50] brother brown says that's what it was
[58:53] see it's still in the word see you can't
[58:55] get out of that word
[58:59] he said it won't leave the word and
[59:02] god's spirit
[59:03] will never leave that word it'll stay
[59:05] right with the word
[59:07] blinding some you say well if it's there
[59:10] why didn't everybody see it
[59:12] because it blinds some but there's a
[59:15] people that were meant to see it it'll
[59:18] stay right with the word blinding some
[59:20] and open the eyes of others it'll always
[59:22] do that now later in 1964 in questions
[59:26] and answers
[59:28] brother random has asked the question of
[59:30] the seven thunders which equals seven
[59:31] mysteries already been revealed were
[59:32] they revealed in the seven seals
[59:34] but not yet known to us as the thunders
[59:38] he said no they were known to us
[59:43] now most people didn't know most of the
[59:45] people brother preached it to didn't
[59:47] understand this
[59:49] but he said they were revealed in the
[59:51] seven fields that's what the thunders
[59:52] was about
[59:55] they was to reveal the seven thunders
[59:56] that had uttered their voices and no one
[59:58] could make out what it was
[1:00:00] john knew what it was but he was
[1:00:01] forbidden to write it now
[1:00:03] that's what it was about they was
[1:00:04] revealed in the seven steels
[1:00:06] so in 1964 the seven thunders were
[1:00:08] revealed
[1:00:10] in 1964 we knew what the thunders were
[1:00:12] so if someone comes and tells you
[1:00:14] that the thunders are something else and
[1:00:17] we had a doctrine in the message for a
[1:00:19] while the thunders were the virtues
[1:00:21] that's not what brother branham said
[1:00:24] and it's not as if brother branham got
[1:00:26] to heaven
[1:00:27] and then said oh man i meant to say that
[1:00:29] the thunders were the virtues and i just
[1:00:31] forgot
[1:00:34] right it's not as if he got up there
[1:00:36] well i'll wait on
[1:00:37] brother so and so he'll come straighten
[1:00:39] it out
[1:00:40] right he didn't do that that's not how
[1:00:43] god works
[1:00:45] but the seventh angel when paul left the
[1:00:47] scene he said i've i've not failed to
[1:00:49] declare to you the whole council of god
[1:00:51] and when brother branham left the scene
[1:00:53] he told us that we had
[1:00:55] the perfect interpretation i believe
[1:00:57] it's the way he put it
[1:00:58] of the scriptures and so it was there it
[1:01:01] didn't mean that
[1:01:02] brother brown never made a mistake or
[1:01:03] there was never any any human error as
[1:01:06] far as the ways spoke or anything like
[1:01:07] that but it meant we had the word
[1:01:10] that supernatural vindication had come
[1:01:14] to show us that this was true amen
[1:01:18] amen now
[1:01:21] the seven thunders had already been
[1:01:24] revealed he said
[1:01:25] he said but the seventh angel now watch
[1:01:28] in the days of his sounding and again
[1:01:29] this is from questions and answers 1964.
[1:01:32] he said but the seventh angel in the
[1:01:34] days of his sounding
[1:01:36] in the days of his sounding right
[1:01:40] the seven mysteries of the seven
[1:01:41] thunders would be revealed
[1:01:43] and the seventh angel is a messenger of
[1:01:45] the seventh church age
[1:01:47] and if the seventh angel is sounded the
[1:01:49] mysteries and the thunders have to be
[1:01:50] revealed
[1:01:53] that's that's the only way that i can
[1:01:55] see it now revelation 10
[1:01:56] 5 and 6
[1:01:59] says the angel which i saw stand upon
[1:02:01] the scene upon the earth lifted up his
[1:02:02] hand to heaven and swear by him that
[1:02:04] liveth forever and ever
[1:02:05] and created heaven and the things that
[1:02:06] there are in the earth and the things
[1:02:08] that there and are in the sea and the
[1:02:10] things which are therein
[1:02:11] there should be time no longer and
[1:02:14] brother brahman says watch here is a
[1:02:15] verse
[1:02:16] i want to get to why because it
[1:02:17] pertained to his ministry
[1:02:19] revelation 10 7 but in the days of the
[1:02:21] voice of the seventh angel
[1:02:23] when he shall begin to sound the mystery
[1:02:26] of god should be finished
[1:02:27] as he has declared to his servants the
[1:02:30] prophets
[1:02:32] but but is a conjunction huh
[1:02:35] so we're saying these things will be
[1:02:37] sealed up and the angels stood up and
[1:02:39] said there should be time no longer but
[1:02:41] in the days
[1:02:43] of the voice of the seventh angel when
[1:02:45] he shall
[1:02:46] begin to sound during the days of his
[1:02:49] sounding is the way brother brandon put
[1:02:50] it the mystery of god should be finished
[1:02:52] as he has declared his servants the
[1:02:55] prophets now
[1:02:57] brother brown said see the mystery of
[1:02:59] this seven seal book will be revealed at
[1:03:01] the soundings back to the breach again
[1:03:04] will be revealed at the sounding of the
[1:03:05] seventh church angel's message
[1:03:08] he said brother ben this is elementary
[1:03:09] but you know it's not elementary to
[1:03:11] everybody
[1:03:12] everybody's got to learn it once right
[1:03:17] and i believe that even a child
[1:03:19] shouldn't have to err in these things
[1:03:21] now he says brother brahm says the
[1:03:24] seventh angel begins to sound
[1:03:26] begins to sound and there he said is the
[1:03:30] messages
[1:03:31] wrote out there and we got it in tape
[1:03:33] and book form
[1:03:37] i mean that's that's a prophet right
[1:03:38] there he's identifying the seventh angel
[1:03:41] sounding as
[1:03:42] the message and people tell you what you
[1:03:44] can only listen to 1963 after the seals
[1:03:47] now he said there is the messages
[1:03:48] already in tape and book form
[1:03:51] prior to the seals being opened
[1:03:56] right the seven things you have begun to
[1:03:57] sound
[1:03:59] right or we just have to throw away the
[1:04:00] church ages and the
[1:04:02] and serpent seed and all those things
[1:04:04] brother branham includes that in the
[1:04:05] opening of the word
[1:04:07] now look he says we got it in tape and
[1:04:09] book form he said now at the beginning
[1:04:11] of the sounding of the message
[1:04:13] the mystery of god should be finished
[1:04:14] see at that time
[1:04:16] he said now we will notice the book of
[1:04:18] the mystery of god is not revealed
[1:04:20] until the seventh angel's message is
[1:04:23] sounded and you can go to anointed ones
[1:04:25] at the end time i won't read at the same
[1:04:26] time but
[1:04:28] he tells us he said not when he starts
[1:04:30] on but when he begins to declare his
[1:04:32] message
[1:04:33] he talked about how the first poll was
[1:04:35] healing second paul was prophesying
[1:04:36] third poll was the opening of the word
[1:04:38] or the mysteries revealed
[1:04:40] and that's pretty simple isn't it
[1:04:44] he said now this is on the breach again
[1:04:47] now these points will be important in
[1:04:49] the seals i'm sure
[1:04:50] he says because it must every bit tie
[1:04:53] together
[1:04:55] if it doesn't tie together it's just not
[1:04:58] true
[1:05:00] right and we have to remember that now
[1:05:02] just because we can't make it tie
[1:05:03] together don't mean we throw it out
[1:05:05] but if it if it's absolutely foreign to
[1:05:07] everything else in the scripture and in
[1:05:09] the message it's just not true
[1:05:11] now it's wrote mysterious
[1:05:14] or at least the way we understand it is
[1:05:16] not true he said it's wrote mysterious
[1:05:18] because no man nowhere knows it god
[1:05:20] alone jesus christ see but
[1:05:22] now but it is a book a mysterious book
[1:05:24] it's the book of redemption
[1:05:26] we'll get into that in a little while he
[1:05:28] said now we know that this book of
[1:05:30] redemption will not be thoroughly
[1:05:31] understood
[1:05:32] do you realize how good we've got it
[1:05:35] i wonder if we realize how good we've
[1:05:37] got it
[1:05:39] this book of redemption will not be
[1:05:40] thoroughly understood it's been
[1:05:42] probed at all through six church ages
[1:05:45] and people don't realize it that some of
[1:05:47] the
[1:05:47] simple doctrines of this message that we
[1:05:49] take so for granted
[1:05:52] that i can take my girls and i don't
[1:05:54] have to try to sit there and
[1:05:56] and hedge about where to show them how
[1:05:57] to be baptized
[1:06:00] my daughter come to me the other day and
[1:06:03] they want to be baptized on sunday
[1:06:05] you couldn't make your daddy happier
[1:06:07] than that
[1:06:11] but see there's a reason why we pulled
[1:06:13] that baptistry out praise the lord maybe
[1:06:15] it'd be the young ones maybe they'll
[1:06:16] start the revival going
[1:06:20] but we said we know this book of
[1:06:21] redemption will not be thoroughly
[1:06:22] understood but now we understand things
[1:06:24] just simple as water baptism i can show
[1:06:26] her
[1:06:26] in the book of acts where it says be
[1:06:28] baptized repent and be baptized in the
[1:06:30] name of jesus christ
[1:06:32] that's simple but the denominations
[1:06:35] almost every one of them got it wrong
[1:06:39] hundreds of denominations all got it
[1:06:41] wrong we take that for granted
[1:06:45] just being able to believe what the
[1:06:47] bible said someone
[1:06:48] told me earlier was talking about how
[1:06:51] that
[1:06:51] uh pentecost will stand there and say
[1:06:54] that tongues is the evidence of the holy
[1:06:55] ghost and we
[1:06:56] can show them and say it's not in the
[1:06:58] scripture
[1:07:00] but almost all pentecostal denominations
[1:07:02] old line pentecostals teach
[1:07:03] that but it's not scriptural why can we
[1:07:06] say that
[1:07:07] because a prophet come and declared it
[1:07:09] to us amen
[1:07:15] realize how good we we've got it it's
[1:07:16] probed at the six church ages but see we
[1:07:18] don't have to probe at it now
[1:07:21] right we're not i'm not taking this and
[1:07:23] and trying to find out where it is
[1:07:25] we know what it is right
[1:07:29] we may overcomplicate it but we know
[1:07:31] what it says
[1:07:33] i'm so glad for the message of the hour
[1:07:36] because it's not a man it's not about a
[1:07:38] man
[1:07:40] it's not about even a prophet it's about
[1:07:42] god
[1:07:43] wanting to get us a message and so he
[1:07:46] chose a messenger before time began
[1:07:48] and he chose the people to receive that
[1:07:49] message
[1:07:51] that's us
[1:07:55] and whoever else will receive he said
[1:07:56] who else can receive it whoever will
[1:07:59] receive it that's who's called to it
[1:08:02] amen i hope i don't bore you tonight but
[1:08:05] this just means so much to me
[1:08:08] he said he winds up all the loose ends
[1:08:11] that those fellows probed at so he
[1:08:12] didn't leave the thunders as a loose end
[1:08:16] right he can't have or he didn't or he
[1:08:18] failed in his ministry
[1:08:20] he can't leave the part of the seals
[1:08:24] loose right he can't leave
[1:08:28] part of of what we believe just hanging
[1:08:30] out there
[1:08:32] but we've got what we need to make it in
[1:08:33] a rapture
[1:08:35] see he didn't need me to come and tie up
[1:08:36] the loose ends
[1:08:38] he tied up the loose hands that's right
[1:08:42] he didn't need anybody else to top the
[1:08:43] loose fence he tied up the loose hands
[1:08:45] and now what we have to do but he said
[1:08:47] well then why do you bother doing this
[1:08:48] was because he told us study this
[1:08:51] take it and break it down he told us to
[1:08:53] do that
[1:08:55] amen i'm so thankful we can do it now
[1:08:56] you don't have to take again my word for
[1:08:58] it but
[1:08:59] a prophet's already spoken no it was
[1:09:02] vindicated now
[1:09:04] he says it's probed at through six
[1:09:06] church ages so we don't have to go and
[1:09:07] say well maybe the
[1:09:08] it could be this or maybe the thunders
[1:09:10] or the virtues maybe brother bran was
[1:09:12] coming back i don't have to do that
[1:09:13] anymore
[1:09:14] if i had to do that if i got to worry
[1:09:16] about that i might as well go back into
[1:09:17] denominational ages
[1:09:20] if it can be just interpreted any way i
[1:09:22] want to that's the way they were with
[1:09:23] the with the bible
[1:09:25] however you wanted to interpret it you
[1:09:26] build a denomination on it that's the
[1:09:28] way that people do with the message
[1:09:29] however they want to interpret it build
[1:09:31] a
[1:09:31] nomination on it i don't have the
[1:09:33] authority to do that
[1:09:34] god said god signified as the book of
[1:09:37] revelation said we've been talking about
[1:09:38] angels he said god
[1:09:40] signified it by his angel to his servant
[1:09:42] john
[1:09:43] god signified by an angel in our day
[1:09:46] what was supposed to be in the word that
[1:09:47] would come and i'm so glad for it
[1:09:50] so all those loose ends he said and the
[1:09:52] mysteries
[1:09:54] come down from god as the word of god
[1:09:58] and reveals the entire revelation of god
[1:10:02] he said then the godhead and everything
[1:10:04] else is settled
[1:10:06] amen all the mysteries serpency whatever
[1:10:09] more is to be revealed brother branham
[1:10:10] talks about
[1:10:11] and is this the sign of the answer he
[1:10:12] goes through those mysteries he talks
[1:10:14] about grace straightened out
[1:10:16] not disgrace aren't you glad to know
[1:10:18] about grace
[1:10:20] no such thing as an eternal burning hell
[1:10:22] the baptism of the holy ghost without
[1:10:24] sensation
[1:10:25] he said but the life of christ coming
[1:10:26] back on the believer
[1:10:28] making you do the works of god baptism
[1:10:31] in the name of jesus christ the pillar
[1:10:33] of fire returning back he uses all those
[1:10:35] as mysteries and he said there were more
[1:10:38] he said now you see back to the breach
[1:10:40] he said you see i'm just not making that
[1:10:42] up he said it's thus saith the lord
[1:10:47] amen i'll read it to you right out of
[1:10:49] the book the sounding of the seventh
[1:10:50] angel's message
[1:10:52] the mystery of god should be finished
[1:10:53] has been declared by its holy prophets
[1:10:55] that's the prophets who has wrote the
[1:10:57] word at the sounding of the seventh
[1:10:59] church age the last church age
[1:11:02] all the loose sins how many of them
[1:11:06] all of them all the lucians
[1:11:10] and the law and through the church ages
[1:11:13] has been probed at will be wound up
[1:11:15] together
[1:11:18] now i went and looked a few times that
[1:11:20] this term loose ends and it doesn't
[1:11:22] it's a commonly used term but it comes
[1:11:26] it's a nautical term it comes from the
[1:11:28] idea of
[1:11:29] when a ship would be just about ready to
[1:11:32] go out to sea
[1:11:34] there would only be one thing left to do
[1:11:35] everything's put away
[1:11:38] all the gunpowder is packed all the
[1:11:40] stores are packed away
[1:11:42] i mean in the days with sailing ships
[1:11:45] the captain of the ship would have the
[1:11:46] sailors go around
[1:11:48] and tie up the loose ends any of the
[1:11:51] rigging anything that needed to be tied
[1:11:53] up he tied it up
[1:11:55] right he said now is the time to tie up
[1:11:56] to loose ends
[1:12:00] we're living in the day when the captain
[1:12:03] of the ship
[1:12:04] commissioned a prophet to tie up the
[1:12:06] loose ends
[1:12:09] you know what happened next the boat
[1:12:11] left
[1:12:13] it was the last thing amen
[1:12:17] hallelujah and so i put that on there go
[1:12:21] to that next that next
[1:12:22] slide instead of a sailor needed to
[1:12:24] prepare his boat for departure he has
[1:12:26] many things to do
[1:12:28] one of the minor details is making sure
[1:12:31] to tie any untied strings
[1:12:33] on board the ship it was the last thing
[1:12:36] they did
[1:12:37] before leaving the harbor
[1:12:40] amen
[1:12:43] we're seeing it church we've seen it the
[1:12:45] loose ends were tied up
[1:12:48] now as brother branham said we're the
[1:12:50] stabilizers have been put on the ship
[1:12:53] he said we'll crest every wave amen
[1:12:56] look he said it was finished let's look
[1:13:00] at that word finish for a minute because
[1:13:01] that
[1:13:02] that's kind of the same meaning the word
[1:13:04] finish
[1:13:06] means to bring to a close to finish to
[1:13:07] end to perform to execute to complete
[1:13:10] also means this he said to do justice
[1:13:13] commanded
[1:13:14] and generally involving the notion of
[1:13:16] time and this is a a greek scholar
[1:13:19] that's looking at the word
[1:13:20] finished he said to do justice commanded
[1:13:23] and generally involving the notion of
[1:13:24] time to perform
[1:13:26] the last act which completes a process
[1:13:32] in the days of the sounding of the
[1:13:34] seventh angel's message
[1:13:36] in the days of the voice of the seventh
[1:13:38] angel when he shall begin to sound
[1:13:40] the mystery of god will be finished
[1:13:44] the last act right
[1:13:47] no more ages no more prophets word
[1:13:49] prophets to the age you understand
[1:13:51] we believe in prophets but there can't
[1:13:54] be a prophet come and tell us something
[1:13:56] different than that prophet did
[1:13:58] right we believe in pastors but a pastor
[1:14:01] got no loose ends to tie up
[1:14:04] right if we're not careful
[1:14:08] you know we get bored with the message
[1:14:09] and we want to make some loose ends just
[1:14:11] so
[1:14:11] somebody can tie them up
[1:14:15] we've got what we need church
[1:14:19] what needs you say what what is lacking
[1:14:22] right here
[1:14:24] if something needs to change it's not
[1:14:26] the message
[1:14:28] it's me it's all of us
[1:14:33] some other members said when the seals
[1:14:35] are broke
[1:14:37] he said and the mystery is revealed down
[1:14:40] comes the angel the messenger
[1:14:42] christ setting his foot upon the land
[1:14:44] and upon the sea
[1:14:45] with a rainbow over his head he said now
[1:14:48] remember
[1:14:50] again an important statement now
[1:14:52] remember this seventh angel is on earth
[1:14:54] at the time of this coming
[1:15:00] now brother branham doesn't make the
[1:15:02] connection
[1:15:03] if you look we have a picture of a cloud
[1:15:05] we show it sometimes on the board
[1:15:07] the picture of the cloud that was taken
[1:15:09] in 1963
[1:15:11] brother branham when he preaches the
[1:15:13] seals i think this is important to
[1:15:14] understand hasn't made that connection
[1:15:16] between that cloud he hasn't even seen
[1:15:19] it yet
[1:15:20] because he didn't see the cloud in the
[1:15:22] shape of jesus
[1:15:23] in the sky as far as we know he's the
[1:15:25] seven angels come down to him
[1:15:28] right he hasn't made the connection yet
[1:15:30] between the cloud and his ministry he
[1:15:32] doesn't make it until june of 1963
[1:15:35] somebody shows it to him and then the
[1:15:37] angel speaks to him and says turn it to
[1:15:38] the right
[1:15:40] you remember if you look at it right
[1:15:42] it's christ
[1:15:43] and it's still that today
[1:15:47] if you look at it right but you got to
[1:15:48] turn it god god
[1:15:50] does things perfectly right because
[1:15:53] people today will
[1:15:54] will try to knock the cloud you notice
[1:15:55] that's the main thing they come against
[1:15:58] right because they try to say well
[1:15:59] brother branham wasn't up there at that
[1:16:00] time or whatever that it was
[1:16:03] but what shape was it in it was in the
[1:16:05] shape of christ
[1:16:06] but you had to turn it right see it
[1:16:10] now as i've said that before if the
[1:16:11] cloud existed in a vacuum by itself it
[1:16:13] wouldn't mean much to us
[1:16:15] just another strange cloud but it
[1:16:17] happened to be
[1:16:18] that a prophet was in the area right and
[1:16:22] that the seals were revealed at that
[1:16:24] time
[1:16:24] so it does have significance now he says
[1:16:28] in what is the attraction in 1965 what
[1:16:31] is the attraction on the mountain he
[1:16:32] finally ties it all together
[1:16:34] at least where i can find where he
[1:16:36] finally ties it all together
[1:16:37] is here in 1965 he said the god of
[1:16:39] heaven promised the evening time
[1:16:41] would have evening light so you can go
[1:16:42] back and look at the context like we
[1:16:44] talked about
[1:16:45] find out that brother bran was talking
[1:16:46] about this
[1:16:48] these seven angels that come down in a
[1:16:49] cloud that's what he's talking about
[1:16:52] and then he comes here and he says the
[1:16:53] god of heaven promised evening time
[1:16:55] would have evening lights
[1:16:57] three years ago this mystery was a
[1:16:58] prophecy what time is it sir
[1:17:02] what did he prophesy and what time is it
[1:17:04] sir
[1:17:05] revelation 10 1-7 an angel
[1:17:09] by the angel coming down that's what it
[1:17:12] was
[1:17:12] three years ago this mystery was a
[1:17:14] prophecy what time is it sir
[1:17:16] but now it's history it's past
[1:17:20] the promise is fulfilled what time is it
[1:17:23] sir and what's this attraction
[1:17:24] god fulfilling his word he's the same
[1:17:27] yesterday today and forever
[1:17:30] god knows what he's doing doesn't he
[1:17:33] let's go back to the breach now
[1:17:35] and again i'm just giving you that for
[1:17:37] further context so you can see how
[1:17:38] brother branham carried that through on
[1:17:40] down in his message
[1:17:42] and in paragraph 42 brother branham says
[1:17:44] just as john was giving his message
[1:17:47] the same time that messiah come in the
[1:17:48] days john knew he would see him
[1:17:51] because he was going to introduce him
[1:17:53] and we realized that in the scriptures
[1:17:55] over in malachi 4 there is to be one
[1:17:57] like john
[1:17:58] and elijah to whom the word of god can
[1:18:00] come to
[1:18:02] we're going to move more quickly now and
[1:18:04] we're almost done for today
[1:18:06] he says he is to reveal by the holy
[1:18:09] spirit notice he
[1:18:10] is to reveal by the holy spirit
[1:18:13] all the mysteries of god and restore the
[1:18:16] faith of the children
[1:18:18] back to the faith of the apostolic
[1:18:20] fathers restore back
[1:18:21] all these mysteries that's been probed
[1:18:24] at
[1:18:25] through these denominational years
[1:18:28] he said now that's what the word said
[1:18:30] i'm just responsible for what it said
[1:18:32] see it's written
[1:18:33] he said is right that's what it is
[1:18:36] he said now we see that this seven still
[1:18:38] book now is the mystery of redemption
[1:18:40] it's a book of redemption from god he
[1:18:43] said now all the mysteries at this time
[1:18:46] should be finished at the sounding of
[1:18:48] this messenger
[1:18:50] he said now here is the angel on earth
[1:18:53] and another
[1:18:54] angel a mighty messenger come down
[1:18:57] see this angel was an earthly angel
[1:18:59] messenger
[1:19:00] but here comes one down from heaven a
[1:19:02] rainbow covenant
[1:19:04] see only christ it could be
[1:19:08] always loved that quote only christ it
[1:19:11] could be
[1:19:12] why because of the way he come down
[1:19:15] don't you see
[1:19:16] what that means to us today it tells us
[1:19:19] he's here
[1:19:21] and john came to declare that he was
[1:19:23] here and he was taken off the scene
[1:19:24] and brother brown came and declared he's
[1:19:26] here and was taken off the scene
[1:19:30] amen hey man now he said only christ
[1:19:34] it could be couldn't be anybody else
[1:19:36] amen because somebody had to stand in
[1:19:38] the breach
[1:19:41] thank the lord a lamb had to take the
[1:19:43] book
[1:19:44] and open the seals people that's a trick
[1:19:47] question by the way
[1:19:49] somebody asked you who opened the seals
[1:19:52] right who opened the seals the lamb
[1:19:55] opened the seals right and then gave it
[1:19:58] to his prophet
[1:20:00] we'll see that later on in the breach if
[1:20:01] we get to it
[1:20:03] the lamb opened the sealed book gave it
[1:20:06] to his prophet and his prophet
[1:20:08] showed it to us but but the lamb opened
[1:20:11] it
[1:20:11] the lamb opens the book and because
[1:20:13] that's what the bible says
[1:20:15] and that's what a prophet come to
[1:20:16] vindicate now
[1:20:18] he says just exactly like he was in
[1:20:20] revelation
[1:20:21] first chapter standing in the midst of
[1:20:23] the seven golden candlesticks with a
[1:20:24] rainbow
[1:20:25] but look upon his jasper and sardis
[1:20:27] stone and here he returns back in the
[1:20:29] 10th chapter after the coming time
[1:20:32] watch again this is sunday night after
[1:20:34] the coming time that all mysteries is to
[1:20:36] be finished
[1:20:37] and the seals are to be broke and
[1:20:39] proclaiming that its
[1:20:41] time is no more
[1:20:44] and i know and please don't you i know
[1:20:46] you're gonna run ahead of me to the
[1:20:48] seventh seal but just
[1:20:49] wait on that for a while maybe we'll get
[1:20:51] to that maybe the lord permits me to
[1:20:52] stay here for
[1:20:53] five or ten or fifteen or twenty years
[1:20:56] maybe we'll get to that
[1:20:58] part of it takes a while to work through
[1:21:00] some of this stuff but
[1:21:02] but you understand that there's there's
[1:21:04] some things brother branham said there
[1:21:05] about that seventh seal
[1:21:07] and there's a part of that that we don't
[1:21:08] know we don't know when he's coming
[1:21:12] we don't know the day or the hour
[1:21:13] somebody says they do they're wrong
[1:21:15] we don't know there's a part that was
[1:21:17] held in the mind of god
[1:21:19] i'm so grateful that everything we need
[1:21:21] to know to make it's been said
[1:21:24] amen now he said
[1:21:29] he said and when the seventh angels
[1:21:30] begin to sound and the mystery should be
[1:21:32] finished and time for the angel to
[1:21:34] appear
[1:21:35] we're close somewhere amen
[1:21:39] he said right he said now notice he said
[1:21:40] the seven seals holds the mystery of the
[1:21:42] book
[1:21:43] until we can see what those seven seals
[1:21:46] has sealed in
[1:21:47] we're only presuming them things
[1:21:53] see the seals the opening of the seals
[1:21:56] was
[1:21:56] more than just brother branham telling
[1:21:59] us
[1:22:00] giving us an idea of what these things
[1:22:02] meant
[1:22:03] because many other men had come preached
[1:22:05] on the seals and said this is what it
[1:22:06] means this is what it means that's what
[1:22:07] it means
[1:22:09] some of them even got it right many men
[1:22:12] did that
[1:22:13] but there was one that it was actually a
[1:22:16] vindication of his ministry
[1:22:20] right and it was a vindicated
[1:22:23] opening of the word so what didn't just
[1:22:25] happen in a vacuum but it was god
[1:22:27] vindicating he used it to vindicate
[1:22:29] brother branham's ministry to show us
[1:22:31] he was that laodicean messenger
[1:22:34] right because unless he was that seventh
[1:22:36] angel then the seals wouldn't be open
[1:22:38] during his time
[1:22:40] during his sounding but if he was the
[1:22:41] seventh angel it had to be opened during
[1:22:44] his sounding
[1:22:46] right now he says
[1:22:50] he said until we see that we're only
[1:22:52] presuming them things i don't want to
[1:22:53] presume
[1:22:54] i'm done presuming right
[1:22:58] brother running uses that word by the
[1:22:59] way and in is it
[1:23:01] is this the sign of the end sir he uses
[1:23:03] that word presuming a lot
[1:23:05] because he doesn't know what it's going
[1:23:06] to be but it was a prophecy
[1:23:09] but now we have more than a prophecy
[1:23:12] right when that when the when jesus he
[1:23:15] said a virgin shall conceive that was a
[1:23:17] prophecy
[1:23:18] but when a baby began crying in a manger
[1:23:20] it was more than a prophecy
[1:23:22] it was a prophecy fulfilled and when
[1:23:25] when god said that the these seals would
[1:23:28] be broke that the mystery god would be
[1:23:29] finished in this time of the seventh
[1:23:30] angel's message
[1:23:31] it was a prophecy but now it's more than
[1:23:33] a prophecy
[1:23:35] it's a fulfilling we've seen that
[1:23:36] fulfilled
[1:23:38] now look he says because i've told you
[1:23:42] this morning upon my little message this
[1:23:44] morning of god hiding in simplicity
[1:23:46] he said you see we are sure to miss the
[1:23:48] thing notice we are
[1:23:50] sure to miss the thing you say we might
[1:23:51] miss it we will miss it
[1:23:54] unless it is absolutely genuinely
[1:23:56] revealed by the holy spirit
[1:23:58] and vindicated the same i'll tell you
[1:24:02] i'll say this it has to be revealed to
[1:24:03] your heart
[1:24:07] this is what brother branham says in all
[1:24:08] close musicians would go ahead and come
[1:24:11] i was late coming out but i'm not late
[1:24:14] quitting
[1:24:16] i know these things can get dry and i
[1:24:17] can overload you i don't want to leave
[1:24:19] you where you don't
[1:24:20] remember what i said what he said
[1:24:25] he said but if the prophet rises and
[1:24:27] tells you that this
[1:24:28] is just that right so if a prophet comes
[1:24:32] and tells you
[1:24:33] that this is that just that this
[1:24:37] is the opening of the word we can say it
[1:24:38] that way and god don't vindicate the
[1:24:41] same forget it
[1:24:44] remember brother brown doesn't know
[1:24:45] about that cloud that shows up in life
[1:24:47] magazine
[1:24:49] huh but god in every statement
[1:24:53] amen see if god don't vindicate it he
[1:24:56] said
[1:24:57] forget it it's not see god always
[1:24:59] vindicates his word
[1:25:01] and see he said and he said well how
[1:25:03] does he do that today
[1:25:04] well you say i'm a christian how does he
[1:25:05] vindicate it by your life
[1:25:08] he vindicates it in your life you live
[1:25:10] as a christian
[1:25:11] you do the greater works you you fulfill
[1:25:14] the the part of a christian
[1:25:16] amen he says but he said if you don't
[1:25:19] vindicate the same forget it see but god
[1:25:21] in every statement
[1:25:22] and everything has to vindicate it to
[1:25:25] make it right
[1:25:26] so his children will watch those things
[1:25:31] amen and be alert
[1:25:34] and they won't just pass it off say well
[1:25:36] it was just this or that or the other
[1:25:37] was just an
[1:25:38] air force base or whatever that it was
[1:25:40] but they watched what what form was it
[1:25:42] in
[1:25:42] it means something to me today after all
[1:25:45] of these years
[1:25:46] why because his children will watch
[1:25:48] those things
[1:25:49] and see if god vindicated in the heavens
[1:25:52] what a prophet said on the earth
[1:25:54] amen amen so much more than just another
[1:25:58] denominational teacher coming up with
[1:25:59] another theory
[1:26:01] but god vindicating his word luke 21 36
[1:26:04] watched you therefore and pray always
[1:26:06] that's the attitude that we should be in
[1:26:08] jesus even about his own
[1:26:10] words that he said he said watch and
[1:26:11] pray that you may be accounted worthy to
[1:26:13] escape all these things that shall come
[1:26:15] to pass
[1:26:16] and to stand before the son of man
[1:26:19] there was a i read a story forgive me
[1:26:21] for leaving you with a story but it's
[1:26:23] something i like to do
[1:26:24] i like to read and read a story that
[1:26:28] a danish philosopher by the name of
[1:26:29] kirkegaard
[1:26:32] told a parable of a where theater
[1:26:35] variety shows is going on and
[1:26:38] each time they have an act it's more
[1:26:41] fantastic than the last one
[1:26:43] so they come out the first time
[1:26:44] something simple and it just keeps
[1:26:46] getting more complicated and more crazy
[1:26:48] and
[1:26:48] the people are so excited you know how
[1:26:50] you would be at a magic show or
[1:26:51] something like that
[1:26:54] and so the every every show is applauded
[1:26:56] by the audience
[1:26:59] suddenly the manager come come forward
[1:27:03] he said i'm sorry for the interruption
[1:27:04] but the theater's on fire
[1:27:09] he says he begin to beg the people to
[1:27:11] leave in an orderly fashion and
[1:27:13] the audience thinks this is the best
[1:27:15] part of the show
[1:27:18] so they applaud
[1:27:21] they all applaud
[1:27:22] [Music]
[1:27:24] but they needed to listen
[1:27:26] [Music]
[1:27:29] you see what what age we live in
[1:27:32] and the old philosopher said this he
[1:27:35] said
[1:27:36] the fire raced to the whole building and
[1:27:38] the consumed the audience with it
[1:27:41] he said i he said so will our age i
[1:27:43] sometimes
[1:27:44] think go down in fiery destruction to
[1:27:47] the applause of a crowded house
[1:27:49] of cheering spectators he said watch and
[1:27:53] pray
[1:27:54] she may be counted worthy to escape
[1:27:57] these things it shall come to pass
[1:27:59] don't don't let later see it get to you
[1:28:02] until you think your applause for the
[1:28:04] messenger is enough
[1:28:06] the applause for the messenger won't get
[1:28:08] you out of the building
[1:28:11] it won't you need to listen to what he
[1:28:14] said
[1:28:16] just saying i believe him yes your
[1:28:18] wonderful messenger brother brahm
[1:28:20] covered that so clearly in the token
[1:28:21] he said it's not enough he makes a
[1:28:23] statement it's not enough to believe
[1:28:27] but you got to believe unto salvation
[1:28:29] you've got to believe it and act on what
[1:28:31] you believe if you really believe
[1:28:33] you're going to act on it amen
[1:28:37] let's bow our heads together heavenly
