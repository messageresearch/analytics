[43:46] we're looking forward to that service
[43:48] this afternoon come if you can and
[43:50] support our young people Job chapter 1
[43:52] and verse one says there was a man in
[43:55] the land of us who whose name was job
[43:59] and that man was perfect and upright and
[44:02] one that feared God and is stewed evil
[44:06] there were born unto him seven sons and
[44:08] three daughters his substance also was
[44:11] 7,000 sheep and 3,000 camels and 500 Yol
[44:15] of oxen and 500 she asses and a very
[44:18] great household so that this man was the
[44:20] greatest of all the men of the East and
[44:23] his sons went and feasted in their
[44:25] houses everyone his day and sent and
[44:27] called for their three sisters to eat
[44:29] and to drink with them and it was so
[44:32] when the days of their feasting were
[44:33] gone about that job sent and Sanctified
[44:36] them and Rose up early in the morning
[44:38] and offered burnt offerings according to
[44:41] the number of them all for job said it
[44:44] may be that my sons have sinned and
[44:46] cursed God in their hearts thus did job
[44:50] continually and then Hebrews chap 10 and
[44:53] verse
[44:55] 35 cast not
[44:58] away
[45:00] therefore your
[45:02] confidence which hath great recompense
[45:05] of
[45:06] reward for you have need of patience I
[45:10] think every one of us can say Amen this
[45:12] morning that after you have done the
[45:15] will of God you might receive the
[45:19] promise pray the Lord would add his
[45:20] Blessing to the word you may be seated
[45:22] this
[45:24] morning I want to speak to you this
[45:26] morning morning on trusting our
[45:30] sacrifice job is remarkable in the
[45:32] scriptures because he is a good man we
[45:34] know that he is the Bible tells us so we
[45:38] know that he's a a godly man we know
[45:41] that he uh and we know that he is a
[45:44] righteous man and we don't know that
[45:46] because of the testimony of his
[45:48] neighbors or the testimony of his
[45:50] friends or the testimony of even his
[45:52] family but we know that because of the
[45:55] testimony of Jehovah himself that he
[45:58] said he have you considered my servant
[46:01] job it was actually God himself that
[46:04] said uh job is a righteous man and
[46:08] that's what we want we it's one thing to
[46:10] have the testimony of our neighbors or
[46:12] the testimony of our family or the
[46:14] testimony of our friends but if we could
[46:16] have the testimony of Jehovah today if
[46:19] we could have the testimony of the Lord
[46:21] says there's a righteous man or a
[46:23] righteous woman and so we we find that
[46:26] job
[46:27] is a wonderful man that has lived a
[46:30] Godly life and God has blessed him and
[46:32] and he's got seven sons and three
[46:34] daughters he's just a he's living a good
[46:36] life and and and one day things begin to
[46:39] take a turn for the worst for job and
[46:42] first he loses uh everything that he has
[46:45] everything that he owns so it would be
[46:47] the equivalent today maybe of being
[46:49] forced to declare bankruptcy or just
[46:51] losing your home losing your your
[46:54] livestock losing everything that you own
[46:56] yeah and then after that he loses all of
[47:00] his children in one day think about that
[47:03] for a minute 10 children in one day he
[47:06] lost I know some of you have experienced
[47:08] great loss but this is just an
[47:10] overwhelming amount of loss and hardship
[47:13] that job is having to face so he loses
[47:15] first first he loses everything he owns
[47:18] and then he loses all of his children
[47:20] right and finally he loses his
[47:23] health and and we find that even as
[47:26] close closest friends believe he is a
[47:29] secret sinner right even his wife
[47:33] overtaken by grief says why don't you
[47:35] curse God and die yeah the the person
[47:38] who should have been there for him and
[47:40] been the strongest for him was actually
[47:43] turned against him everybody had turned
[47:45] against job everybody believed that job
[47:47] surely did something to deserve this
[47:50] kind of treatment from God they they
[47:53] were all in agreement that job surely
[47:56] was the the secret sinner surely he did
[47:58] something wrong but we know given the
[48:02] benefit of being able to look through
[48:04] the scriptures of what was going on we
[48:06] know that job that there had actually
[48:09] been a conversation about job but
[48:12] between God and the devil yeah that they
[48:14] had had a conversation and and job is
[48:17] actually suffering because God
[48:19] recommended him for it right so God says
[48:22] have you considered my servant job right
[48:26] he doing real good right now yeah yeah
[48:30] does it ever seem like that's happened
[48:32] in your life come on Church we've all
[48:34] been there we've all you know we've all
[48:35] seemed like things are going along just
[48:37] well and it seemed like God just
[48:39] recommends us and say have you
[48:40] considered and we know that because
[48:42] that's what God he tells us in the book
[48:44] but job doesn't necessarily know that
[48:47] job doesn't realize that God has
[48:49] recommended him for suffering it might
[48:51] have helped him to know that but he
[48:53] doesn't know that he he doesn't
[48:54] recognize that and so he doesn't know
[48:57] why it's just one day it happens yeah
[48:59] there's no explanation come on there's
[49:02] no warning yeah right it's not like one
[49:04] day he's serving God and doing good and
[49:06] then and then God comes and tells him
[49:07] says now you're going to lose this and
[49:09] you're going to lose that I want you to
[49:10] be ready for it he he wasn't ready for
[49:12] it right he he suddenly loses everything
[49:15] all at
[49:16] once and he loses even his own health
[49:19] and and we know that we know that it
[49:22] happened because God allowed it but job
[49:25] in the moment can't see that that and
[49:28] when he finds out about his children his
[49:31] response is heartbreaking and yet it
[49:33] strengthens our faith because we can see
[49:36] the kind of faith that a man could have
[49:38] in God the kind of confidence he could
[49:40] have in God in spite of what he had been
[49:42] through that the Bible says when he
[49:44] heard this the news about his children
[49:46] in job 1:20 then job arose and rent his
[49:49] mantel and shaved his head all the
[49:52] classic signs of of grief yeah and fell
[49:56] down upon on the ground right but he
[49:58] didn't fall down in pity all right he
[50:00] didn't fall down and say wo it's me he
[50:02] didn't fall down and say well I'm I'm
[50:04] done I I'm not going to serve God no
[50:06] more but what did he fall down and do
[50:08] Church come on he fell down in worship
[50:11] and that's the kind of people that God
[50:12] wants today I believe that's what he's
[50:14] made us to be that when we go through
[50:16] the very darkest moments of our life the
[50:18] very worst times of Life We Fall Down
[50:20] and Worship because we're not God and we
[50:22] don't understand necessarily what's
[50:25] going on in the throne room of Heaven
[50:26] but we know that God is good and he's
[50:29] doing it for our
[50:31] good somehow job says Naked came I out
[50:35] of my mother's womb and naked shall I
[50:37] return thither the lord gave and the
[50:40] Lord hath taken away blessed be the name
[50:45] oh yes of the Lord right it's one thing
[50:47] to say I know I come with nothing I know
[50:49] I leave with nothing it's another thing
[50:51] to say the lord gave and the Lord has
[50:53] taken away but look at his response to
[50:56] that it's not I'm going to blame the
[50:58] Lord I'm going to say there's no God I'm
[50:59] going to blame the message of the hour
[51:01] that's not his response at all but what
[51:03] does he say I came naked of the world
[51:05] I'll go out naked Lord gives the Lord's
[51:08] taken away blessed be the name I wonder
[51:11] if there'd be somebody here this morning
[51:13] that could say that with Jo blessed be
[51:15] the name of the Lord I'm going to
[51:17] worship in spite of my circumstances I'm
[51:19] going to worship in spite of everything
[51:21] going on around me yes blessed be the
[51:25] name of the Lord Lord good brother
[51:28] brandom said he was actually
[51:30] happy when he heard the news that his
[51:34] children had passed away not happy that
[51:37] they'd passed but he was happy that he
[51:39] made a
[51:40] sacrifice for his
[51:44] children in chapter 2 satan goes to God
[51:47] again in verse six the Lord said to
[51:49] Satan behold he's in thine hand yeah but
[51:52] save his life so went Satan forth from
[51:55] the presence of the Lord and smoked job
[51:57] with sore boils from the sole of his
[51:58] foot to his crown and he took him a
[52:01] potur to scrape himself with a and he
[52:04] sat down among the
[52:08] ashes let's join him on the ash sheep
[52:10] here for a
[52:11] moment then then said his wife unto him
[52:14] Dost thou still retain thine
[52:17] Integrity Curse God and die but he said
[52:22] unto her thou speakest he didn't call
[52:24] her a foolish woman but he said you
[52:26] speak like a foolish woman thou speakest
[52:29] as one of the foolish women speaketh
[52:32] what shall we receive good at the hand
[52:34] of God and shall we not receive evil in
[52:38] all this did not job sin with his
[52:42] lips job doesn't really lose lose it as
[52:47] we would say he doesn't really lose his
[52:49] composure until it's three
[52:53] church friends
[52:57] his
[52:58] friends came
[53:00] calling brandom said in one place it was
[53:02] three people from a different church and
[53:03] another place there three people from
[53:05] his church in one place he said it was
[53:07] three
[53:11] deacons glad we got good deacons
[53:14] yeah but they come looking for him in in
[53:17] job 2:12 when they lifted up their eyes
[53:19] a far off and knew him not he he was so
[53:22] they'd always seen job prosperous they'd
[53:25] always seen job with money and with with
[53:27] things and they look out and see job's
[53:29] suffering right right and they don't
[53:31] recognize job in that condition so they
[53:35] when they knew him not they lifted up
[53:37] their voice and wept and they rent
[53:38] everyone his mantle and sprinkled dust
[53:41] upon their heads toward heaven so they
[53:44] sat down with him upon the ground seven
[53:46] days and seven nights and none spake a
[53:49] word unto him for they saw that his
[53:51] grief was very great have you ever been
[53:53] in a situation where the pain was so
[53:55] real you didn't know what to to say so
[53:57] you just sat there you just sit there
[53:59] say well we're here but we don't know
[54:01] what to say we don't know what to do cuz
[54:03] there is no words that could make up for
[54:06] what had happened in job's life and they
[54:09] saw his grief was very great and after
[54:11] this job 3 And1 job opened job his mouth
[54:15] and cursed his day and if you go read it
[54:20] job gets really
[54:22] down and he says it' been better for me
[54:24] not to live he was a good man but he was
[54:28] still affected by things that happened
[54:29] in his life right and I don't think we
[54:31] should expect people you know sometimes
[54:34] you say well as we preached last week on
[54:36] counted all joy and we expect people say
[54:38] well just have a smile on their face
[54:39] it's not what that means it means that
[54:41] you count it Joy you you you arrange
[54:45] your thoughts you you control your
[54:47] thoughts it's not that you feel Joy
[54:50] because you're not always going to feel
[54:52] Joy you're not always going to feel
[54:54] happy let me go a little bit further
[54:55] you're not always going feel saved come
[54:58] on now right you're not always going to
[55:00] feel saved you're not always going to
[55:02] feel uh upsid instead the back seid
[55:05] you're not always going to feel like
[55:06] you've got a one-on-one connection with
[55:08] God you're not always going to feel like
[55:10] your prayers are going through but it's
[55:12] in those moments when you don't feel it
[55:14] that's when you you got to take your
[55:16] thoughts into captivity and say Lord I
[55:18] know your word is true I know you're the
[55:20] same yesterday today and forever I Know
[55:22] You're My Healer whether I feel healed
[55:24] or not I know you're my savior can
[55:25] anybody testify to that this morning
[55:27] whether I feel saved or not I know
[55:29] you're my deliverer whether I feel like
[55:31] I'm in bondage or
[55:35] delivered he said why am I
[55:38] alive why have I ever was I ever born he
[55:42] said been better for me to have never
[55:45] been born yeah and then if he wasn't
[55:48] feeling bad enough his friends started
[55:49] to
[55:51] talk it's bad enough when they were
[55:53] quiet now they start to talk all right
[55:57] and when they started to talk he saidis
[56:00] not this thy fear this is the the first
[56:03] of his friends as they begin to talk as
[56:05] there's a great back and forth in job
[56:07] between job and his three friends and
[56:08] then elu who's the type of Christ and
[56:11] then finally God
[56:13] speaks but in job 4 the first of his
[56:16] three friends begin to talk said is not
[56:18] this thy Fear Thy confidence so he's
[56:22] challenging job he's saying you're
[56:25] saying that this has happened to you he
[56:28] said there must be a reason why it's
[56:30] happening and he said is not your
[56:32] confidence thy hope and the uprightness
[56:35] of thy ways but they had misplaced job's
[56:40] confidence right they looked at it and
[56:42] the thing is if you go and read what the
[56:44] friend said it was all true
[56:47] stuff right it's not it's not untrue but
[56:51] it doesn't apply to job's
[56:53] situation right and sometimes the devil
[56:55] can take the word and beat you up with
[56:57] it yeah right because it may be true
[57:01] right right but it doesn't apply to your
[57:03] situation come on right it may be true
[57:06] there are people there are people who be
[57:08] lost and go to hell yeah but if you're a
[57:10] born again child of God that doesn't
[57:12] apply to your situation right there are
[57:14] people who are backset but if you're
[57:17] willing to give your heart to God this
[57:18] morning that doesn't apply to your
[57:20] situation right are you with me now
[57:22] there's situations that are uh where
[57:25] people where it's hopeless but
[57:27] hopelessness never applies to the
[57:30] believer's situation because there's
[57:32] hope even even if if a Believer would
[57:35] die he's not going to stay in the grave
[57:37] he he he's coming up out of there's a
[57:39] body prepared as uh I believe brother
[57:41] Joel said uh Wednesday night there's
[57:44] already a body prepared for you you you
[57:46] can't lose aren't you glad for that
[57:48] today but but see they so these things
[57:51] were maybe true statements but they
[57:53] didn't apply to job and we need to make
[57:56] careful that we don't make the bride the
[57:58] church we need to make be careful that
[58:00] we don't apply those things that are
[58:03] given we're not L to sins come on now
[58:06] right we live in Leo DEA but we're not L
[58:09] to sins and if we begin to think of
[58:11] ourselves as Le the sin well well I'm
[58:13] lukewarm because that's just the age no
[58:15] that's not what we're supposed to be
[58:17] we're supposed to be on fire for God
[58:20] we're not God is not knocking at the
[58:21] door of the Bride to get in he's
[58:23] knocking at the door of the church to
[58:25] get in but that the the bride is in a
[58:27] different place in communion with him
[58:29] we've opened the door and let him in we
[58:32] should not you know our services
[58:33] shouldn't be cold and formal why because
[58:36] because we're not a part of the cold
[58:38] formal church we don't Place ourselves
[58:40] under that we we place our identity as
[58:45] the bride we are loved by God are you
[58:49] with me now we are chosen by God elected
[58:52] by God called by God into a place beyond
[58:56] what any we've ever could see or hoped
[58:58] to be God is we we're going to heaven
[59:00] we're going to make it right and so
[59:03] these things may have been true but not
[59:07] true of job oh my yeah and
[59:11] sometimes you sometimes you got to think
[59:13] about yourself as I'm just preaching to
[59:16] you now from my heart but you got to
[59:18] think of yourself as the exception to
[59:20] the rule yeah that makes sense look at
[59:22] the our phenician woman and she comes to
[59:24] Jesus and and he speaks to her what the
[59:28] rule is yeah right he's the word and
[59:31] he's speaking to her the word yeah and
[59:34] he says the dog he said the it's not
[59:36] meat for me it's not it's not uh the the
[59:39] the procedure is not for me to give uh
[59:42] the the meat or or the uh the children's
[59:45] bread to dogs he said it's not it's not
[59:48] right for me to do that it's not the
[59:50] Gentiles time it's not their era yeah
[59:53] but she said that's true yes sir that's
[59:56] true oh my but it doesn't apply to
[1:00:00] me hallelujah it's true but it doesn't
[1:00:03] apply to me because even the little dogs
[1:00:05] eat the crumbs that fall from the
[1:00:07] master's table you can find Hope in the
[1:00:09] word of God if you're looking for Hope
[1:00:11] in the word of God many times the reason
[1:00:13] people find judgment and condemnation
[1:00:15] and and fear is because that's all
[1:00:17] they're looking for the devil's got them
[1:00:19] tricked into looking for that but we're
[1:00:21] not to do that we're to look for joy and
[1:00:23] peace and longsuffering and gentleness
[1:00:25] and kindness and the good things of God
[1:00:27] are you with me now not we understand we
[1:00:30] can be corrected we understand but he
[1:00:32] deals with us as Sons he doesn't deal
[1:00:34] with us as as somebody out here in the
[1:00:37] world somewhere but we're his sons and
[1:00:39] daughters and he deals with us that way
[1:00:43] yes
[1:00:44] so his friend comes and says isn't this
[1:00:48] your
[1:00:49] confidence he said remember I pray thee
[1:00:51] whoever perish being
[1:00:54] innocent he said where were the
[1:00:56] righteous cut
[1:00:57] off right and it's true but not true of
[1:01:01] job's situation yeah even as I have seen
[1:01:04] they that plow iniquity so w wickedness
[1:01:07] reap the same it's true but not true of
[1:01:11] job's
[1:01:13] situation so his best friends come and
[1:01:16] called him a
[1:01:17] sinner people from his church people
[1:01:20] that loved him or confessed that they
[1:01:22] did yeah brother BR said listen job knew
[1:01:25] in his heart that he wasn't a secret
[1:01:30] sinner right now how did he know that CU
[1:01:34] you realize you could commit sin if you
[1:01:35] were just as a sinner You' commit sin
[1:01:39] you could commit sin and not even know
[1:01:41] it yeah right we miss the mark all the
[1:01:44] time right right I pray God Purge
[1:01:48] cleanse me from Secret sins that's the
[1:01:49] way David puts it yeah right those
[1:01:52] things I don't even know about right we
[1:01:54] could miss the mark and not even
[1:01:56] recognize right we had anything to
[1:01:58] repent for yeah how did job know that he
[1:02:03] wasn't a secret
[1:02:05] sinner it wasn't because of his goodness
[1:02:09] it wasn't because although he does tried
[1:02:12] to defend himself in that way he said I
[1:02:14] he said I I I I've made a covenant with
[1:02:16] my eyes he said that I wouldn't look on
[1:02:18] a maid so he said I haven't sinned with
[1:02:20] women he said I haven't sinned with
[1:02:22] money I've given to the poor I haven't
[1:02:24] sinned in my in my words I've I've
[1:02:26] declared my allegiance to God though he
[1:02:27] saves me yet I'll trust him right he he
[1:02:30] said I'm not a sinner in that way and we
[1:02:33] can look at our own lives and see those
[1:02:34] things the fruit of our lives but how
[1:02:36] did he know come on now come on Church
[1:02:39] the same way that you can know right why
[1:02:43] he had made a
[1:02:45] sacrifice something had died in his
[1:02:48] place I know this is simple this morning
[1:02:50] but I want us to understand it from the
[1:02:52] very depths of our soul because it's
[1:02:53] probably the question I deal with more
[1:02:55] than any other other thing as a pastor
[1:02:57] is I is how do I know that I'm not being
[1:03:01] punished how do I know that God doesn't
[1:03:03] hate me how do I know that God's just
[1:03:05] not making me pay for what I did because
[1:03:08] you were in his body on the
[1:03:11] cross we were in him on the cross
[1:03:14] brother Brandon preaches that to us in
[1:03:16] Christ is the mystery of God revealed
[1:03:17] that the bride was a mystery hid in
[1:03:19] Christ on the cross yeah as Christ is
[1:03:22] the mystery of God revealed the bride is
[1:03:24] the mystery of Christ revealed he we
[1:03:26] were in him which means we died in him
[1:03:29] yeah remember after he died they pierced
[1:03:31] his side and the blood and the water
[1:03:32] come out and it was separated the bride
[1:03:34] was separated from the groom don't you
[1:03:36] real that means when when he died we
[1:03:38] were in him which means every sin you
[1:03:40] ever did all right or you ever would do
[1:03:43] all right is Judge I hope I can drive
[1:03:46] this home this morning is Judge in that
[1:03:50] body right so when he died that's why
[1:03:52] the cross is so important to us brother
[1:03:55] bam tells in uh in a be certain of God
[1:03:58] he said he said there's nothing that'll
[1:04:00] bring the fire he said they've never
[1:04:02] found anything that'll bring fire like
[1:04:03] two
[1:04:04] sticks across that's true of the church
[1:04:08] too yeah right there's never been
[1:04:09] anything that'll that'll produce fire
[1:04:11] that'll burn like like two sticks if you
[1:04:13] preach the truth about the cross cuz
[1:04:15] what does the cross do the cross means
[1:04:17] that the sin has already been judged in
[1:04:19] our life we cannot be judged for sin God
[1:04:21] doesn't see right and how can you see
[1:04:24] sin pastor the death of his own son on
[1:04:27] the cross how can he see through the
[1:04:29] blood of the one who died for us I'm not
[1:04:32] giving you a license to sin this morning
[1:04:34] if you ever knew what God did for you
[1:04:36] you would never want to do anything that
[1:04:38] would cause you to miss the Mark again
[1:04:40] you'd want to be in the house of God
[1:04:42] you'd want to be but those things don't
[1:04:44] save you you if you ever realize what
[1:04:46] God did for you you'd want to be a good
[1:04:47] Christian yeah are you with me if you
[1:04:50] ever wanted to if you ever realize what
[1:04:52] God did for you on the cross you you'd
[1:04:54] want to work if you were a and provide
[1:04:56] for your family because that's what
[1:04:58] Christians do right if you ever you'd
[1:05:01] want to pay your bills you'd want to be
[1:05:02] a good person in the community if you
[1:05:04] ever wanted if you ever knew what he did
[1:05:06] for you really knew what he did for you
[1:05:08] you'd want to dress right and look right
[1:05:10] and live right all right but those
[1:05:11] things don't save you you were you were
[1:05:13] in him on the cross yes and your sins
[1:05:16] were judged in him
[1:05:19] right yeah yes sir oh church we just
[1:05:23] recognize that today and there's there's
[1:05:25] only one way to be welcomed back into
[1:05:29] fellowship with God again and that's
[1:05:30] through the man Christ Jesus that's the
[1:05:33] only way yeah so job knew in his heart
[1:05:37] that he wasn't a secret sinner because
[1:05:38] he confessed his sins upon the basis of
[1:05:42] the shed blood remember the lamb was
[1:05:43] shed the lamb was killed before the
[1:05:46] foundation of the world right and that's
[1:05:48] why they could take the Lamb of a bowl
[1:05:50] or goat or or the blood of a bowl or a
[1:05:52] goat or a lamb in the Old Testament it
[1:05:54] would cover sin yeah the offering had to
[1:05:56] be made once a year it would cover sin
[1:05:59] it put it off because in the mind of God
[1:06:02] the Lamb of God was already expained
[1:06:04] yeah right so it put it off but it had
[1:06:06] to happen in actuality yeah so that you
[1:06:08] and I could be completely free from sin
[1:06:11] right but job confessed his sins under
[1:06:14] the basis of the shed blood he knew that
[1:06:16] God was under obligation yes to meet him
[1:06:20] on those basis right the only
[1:06:24] propitiation for sin that's payment
[1:06:27] atonement right was the shed blood of
[1:06:30] the Lamb yeah which God promised
[1:06:33] Redemption as a shadow to last until
[1:06:35] Christ come and job had met God on those
[1:06:40] basis yes not by how much money he'd
[1:06:43] given away not by how many times he'd
[1:06:46] gone to church are you hearing me church
[1:06:49] not by how much ties he paid he did not
[1:06:52] meet God that way right but he met God
[1:06:55] by offering the sacrifice that God
[1:06:58] required yes somehow job had a
[1:07:01] revelation even before the Bible was
[1:07:04] written that when man fell God required
[1:07:06] a sacrifice to cover his sins I don't
[1:07:08] know maybe he saw it in the heavens yeah
[1:07:11] right when he looked up and he saw it
[1:07:12] maybe he heard the story of how Adam
[1:07:14] fell and what had to happen there at the
[1:07:16] Garden for him to be redeemed right when
[1:07:19] they walked out with the bloody sheep
[1:07:20] skin slapping up against her leg Yeah
[1:07:23] and and so maybe it heard the story
[1:07:25] story maybe he'd seen it in the heavens
[1:07:27] maybe which was God's first Bible
[1:07:28] written in the heavens maybe maybe he
[1:07:31] had seen or he'd heard or somehow he
[1:07:34] understood from nature that that God
[1:07:37] that something had taken place and
[1:07:39] Redemption had to happen for there to be
[1:07:40] a
[1:07:41] resurrection and when man fell God
[1:07:44] required a sacrifice to cover sin
[1:07:46] somehow he knew that by Revelation he
[1:07:48] knew that he had confidence he had done
[1:07:51] what God had required he knew that the
[1:07:54] welcome mat at the door of fellowship
[1:07:56] with God right is the shed blood of a
[1:07:59] lamb Stuart when you read that quote the
[1:08:01] other day and I believe it was you read
[1:08:03] the quote I had a welcome man in it
[1:08:05] God's welcome man I just about danced a
[1:08:07] jig and I went back and looked it up
[1:08:09] brother the random says over and over
[1:08:10] again the blood is a welcome mat for us
[1:08:12] to come back into the house of God it's
[1:08:14] a welcome mat back into Fellowship I
[1:08:17] couldn't come in I was barred from the
[1:08:19] house of God but the blood of the Lamb
[1:08:21] become a big old sign big old M said
[1:08:23] welcome in and when I walk across it I'm
[1:08:26] coming on God's shed blood the basis of
[1:08:29] his shed blood and I am not responsible
[1:08:31] for my sins anymore my sins were judged
[1:08:34] at Calvary right oh I hope you hear me
[1:08:39] today
[1:08:41] good what do you need to do you say

[1:09:27] times we
[1:09:28] suffer and we and we realize that
[1:09:31] suffering you know God allows us to
[1:09:33] suffer if we couldn't feel it it
[1:09:36] wouldn't really be suffering Jesus
[1:09:39] actually felt the pain of the nails yes
[1:09:42] God didn't send down a a batch of
[1:09:44] Lidocaine or some kind of painkiller
[1:09:46] yeah for Jesus on the cross right he had
[1:09:49] to feel every yes oh church he felt

[1:10:06] of a loved one right we feel rejection

[1:12:02] yourselves like your God like you know
[1:12:06] why job was wise enough to know that if
[1:12:09] God didn't give him an answer they sure
[1:12:10] didn't have an
[1:12:14] answer why do you persecute me as God
[1:12:17] and are not satisfied with my flesh oh
[1:12:20] that my words were now
[1:12:22] written oh that they were printed in a
[1:12:24] book yeah that they were graving with an
[1:12:27] iron pin LED in the rock
[1:12:29] forever for I know all
[1:12:33] right I know how many can say it with
[1:12:36] him this morning I know that my redeemer
[1:12:40] liveth I know that my redeemer liveth I
[1:12:43] may be going through pain but I know my
[1:12:45] redeemer liveth I may have experienced
[1:12:46] hardship but I know my redeemer
[1:12:49] liveth I know that my redeemer
[1:12:52] liveth and and that he will stand at the
[1:12:55] latter day upon the Earth listen many
[1:12:57] things job says in the Book of Job any
[1:13:00] unbeliever could say God where are you
[1:13:04] God why aren't you addressing my
[1:13:06] situation many things he said any
[1:13:08] unbeliever could say but there were
[1:13:11] moments of inspiration that only a
[1:13:13] Believer could speak and it was that
[1:13:15] moment it's the moment that makes the
[1:13:16] difference many people experience what
[1:13:18] we experience many people experience
[1:13:20] hardship and struggle and and
[1:13:22] unexplainable things that happened to
[1:13:24] them in their lives and yet at the same
[1:13:26] time though these things are common to
[1:13:28] man but only a few have that inspiration
[1:13:31] in their soul and said I know yes I'm
[1:13:33] suffering yes I've been through it yes
[1:13:35] I've got some hard times going on but I
[1:13:37] know my redeemer living there was he was
[1:13:39] he was just a man he was just a man
[1:13:41] speaking but now it's God speaking
[1:13:43] through a man by inspiration out of the
[1:13:46] heart out of a troubled life out of
[1:13:49] struggle yeah God is speaking good David
[1:13:52] many of the things David said anybody
[1:13:54] could have said when he said my God my
[1:13:56] God why hast Thou forsaken me God was
[1:13:58] speaking through his pain yes all right
[1:14:01] speaking of the Cross that's
[1:14:05] good I know my redeemer liveth and in
[1:14:09] the last day he shall stand at the
[1:14:11] latter day upon the Earth and though
[1:14:12] after my skin worms destroy this body
[1:14:17] yet in my
[1:14:18] flesh what a powerful statement yes job
[1:14:22] had never read 1 Corinthians 15:51
[1:14:26] behold I show you mystery we shall not
[1:14:27] all sleep but we shall all be changed in
[1:14:29] a moment in a twinkling of an eye like
[1:14:31] he never read that he'd never read first
[1:14:33] Thessalonians 4 where he said the I will
[1:14:36] not have you be ignorant Brethren
[1:14:37] concerning them which are asleep he
[1:14:38] never read it he didn't have it to read
[1:14:41] but something in his heart grabbed a
[1:14:43] hold of the truth of the resurrection
[1:14:44] and he said I may be going through it
[1:14:46] but I'm not this is not the end there's
[1:14:48] something more for me yes sir yes though
[1:14:52] this body decay in the grave yeah yet in
[1:14:55] my flesh shall I see God whom I shall
[1:14:59] see for myself and my eyes Shall Behold
[1:15:01] and not another oh my Reigns be consumed
[1:15:04] within me though the very DNA that I'm
[1:15:06] made from go back to dust dust to dust
[1:15:09] and Ashes to Ashes yet I know I will
[1:15:11] seek
[1:15:14] God he said I know I haven't
[1:15:17] sinned I've offered the sacrifice I put
[1:15:19] the sacrifice out there just according
[1:15:21] to God's word and I believe that God has
[1:15:24] accepted it not a sinner yeah I wonder
[1:15:26] if we can cross over that threshold
[1:15:28] today come across the door come through
[1:15:32] the the door with the welcome mat laying
[1:15:34] there if you could walk across that
[1:15:35] today and quit thinking of yourself as a
[1:15:37] sinner as I know I haven't sinned if I'm
[1:15:40] going through something I know there's a
[1:15:41] purpose for it I know God has forgiven
[1:15:44] me he said well I did things yesterday
[1:15:46] but but you ask for forgiveness today
[1:15:48] it's that close to you you just ask him
[1:15:51] for forgiveness and he gives it to you
[1:15:53] abundantly over and over again If any
[1:15:55] man sin there is an advocate yes sir oh
[1:15:58] I'm so thankful for the advocate
[1:16:00] today
[1:16:02] yes can you see it this morning can can
[1:16:06] you walk through the door the welcome
[1:16:08] mat is
[1:16:11] there oh my job brother said by
[1:16:13] inspiration somehow grabbed a hold of it
[1:16:15] he was talking about how how he looked
[1:16:17] at a flower he said well the flower dies
[1:16:19] yeah he said so so there must be he said
[1:16:22] it's like sin he dies from sin but
[1:16:23] there's a resurrection so there must be
[1:16:25] Redemption right the flower dies because
[1:16:28] of sin right in the beginning the
[1:16:29] flowers has never died the flower died
[1:16:31] because of sin but the reason the flower
[1:16:33] comes back is to show us there's a
[1:16:36] resurrection amen some morning there's a
[1:16:38] resurrection some spring Hall church I
[1:16:41] could
[1:16:41] just I could just bust a move this
[1:16:44] morning and that would be Supernatural
[1:16:47] if I could
[1:16:49] dance I'm not even sure that's a good
[1:16:53] thing but are you with this morning he
[1:16:56] knew if the if the if the flower had
[1:16:58] hope of redemption surely
[1:17:01] mankind has got some hope right I don't

[1:17:21] yes that's why we need to get to the
[1:17:23] place where we get to this place of
[1:17:25] where we're walking in the light of the
[1:17:27] word we've walked through the door we're
[1:17:29] not up and down all the time in and out
[1:17:31] all the time right come on I'm not
[1:17:34] criticizing you I'm telling you walk

[1:17:40] go through things but it don't get me
[1:17:43] down momentarily I may have a frown on
[1:17:46] my face but pretty soon a smile is going
[1:17:47] to light it up because I don't no matter
[1:17:49] what they do to me right yeah I'll be
[1:17:53] okay yes
[1:17:59] the devil could put Paul and Silas in
[1:18:01] prison but he couldn't take away their
[1:18:05] Joy couldn't take their
[1:18:08] song heard a song One Time said I I've
[1:18:11] lost a lot of things lost a lot of good
[1:18:12] friends lost a lot of people but I never
[1:18:14] lost my
[1:18:16] praise job said I lost my family but I
[1:18:18] worship you Lord I've been through some
[1:18:21] things but blessed be the name yes yes
[1:18:25] Hallelujah good why he knew his there
[1:18:27] was hope there was a
[1:18:29] redeemer and job seen what the lamb
[1:18:32] meant the said he got it by Revelation
[1:18:34] he saw what the lamb meant he shook
[1:18:36] himself stood up being a prophet the
[1:18:38] Spirit come on him he said I know my
[1:18:40] redeemer liveth oh there you are why
[1:18:44] I've come on the basis of redemption
[1:18:47] I've come offering the shed blood that
[1:18:50] represents his blood this is the type
[1:18:53] this is the lamb we have much more
[1:18:56] reason to be confident than job
[1:19:02] did much more reason Hebrews 10:1 for
[1:19:05] the law having a shadow of good things
[1:19:09] to come and not the very image of the
[1:19:11] things can never with those sacrifices
[1:19:14] which they offered year by year
[1:19:16] continually make the comers there and
[1:19:18] two
[1:19:19] perfect for then would they not have
[1:19:21] ceased to be offered in other words if
[1:19:23] they made if they took took away the
[1:19:25] desire of sin wouldn't they have been
[1:19:28] offered once and that was good enough he
[1:19:30] said they would not have ceased to be
[1:19:32] offered because the worshippers once
[1:19:33] purged should have no more conscience or
[1:19:36] desire of
[1:19:39] sins but in those sacrifices there is a
[1:19:41] remembrance again made of sins every
[1:19:44] year yeah right and that's the way some
[1:19:47] people live oh my yeah you realize that
[1:19:50] if you if you don't take advantage of
[1:19:52] the open door and walk walk into the
[1:19:55] blood of Christ you're living the law
[1:19:57] all right with no sacrifice that's
[1:20:00] right right because the sacri you can't
[1:20:03] you're not going and dragging a bulll or
[1:20:04] a goat and the truth is if if I did it
[1:20:06] today if I tried to well I'll cover it
[1:20:08] it's not effective anymore the day that
[1:20:11] the that he died on the cross the veil
[1:20:13] of the temple was rent from top to
[1:20:15] bottom the ceremonial law was done away
[1:20:18] with come on feel well I don't eat pork
[1:20:20] I don't I I worship on Saturday I do
[1:20:23] this that or the other the ceremonial
[1:20:24] was done away with yeah right that day
[1:20:27] on Calvary that law passed away and the
[1:20:31] and and the law of Liberty was
[1:20:33] born right and only in that so you're
[1:20:35] trying to live a law but you you
[1:20:37] couldn't we couldn't even do it if we
[1:20:38] tried to make a sacrifice correctly we
[1:20:41] probably couldn't even find a cow
[1:20:42] without a without a spot on it right a
[1:20:45] red hifer they've been trying to get a
[1:20:46] red heffer in Jerusalem for years so
[1:20:49] they could make a sacrifice and been
[1:20:51] unable to do it to find one perfect
[1:20:54] enough to find one with they've been
[1:20:55] breeding them just to produce pure
[1:20:58] efforts and every time they do they they
[1:21:00] they find one that's got a a little
[1:21:01] white spot on it or a little bit of
[1:21:03] something on it that's a little
[1:21:04] different color and it's got to be a
[1:21:06] pure red effort don't you realize Christ
[1:21:08] abolished the law don't you real he
[1:21:10] fulfilled the law on
[1:21:14] Calvary and we don't put ourselves under
[1:21:16] those bondages again right Paul said oh
[1:21:19] foolish Galatians who has Bewitched you
[1:21:21] that you'd come under those bondage
[1:21:23] those bondages of the law again
[1:21:25] but see if they had been any good they
[1:21:27] would not there would not be a
[1:21:28] remembrance of sin right for it is not
[1:21:31] possible that the blood of bulls and of
[1:21:33] goats should take away sins jump to
[1:21:34] verse 11 he said every priest standeth
[1:21:36] daily ministering and offering often
[1:21:38] times the same sacrifices which can
[1:21:41] never take away sins but this man who's
[1:21:44] the man can we identify the man this
[1:21:46] morning the man Christ Jesus this man
[1:21:49] after he had offered one sacrifice for
[1:21:52] sins forever yeah come on Church forever
[1:21:57] he don't have to die again every time
[1:21:58] you make a
[1:22:00] mistake
[1:22:02] right I hope you're hearing me he don't
[1:22:05] die again every time we mess up forever
[1:22:08] someone say it with me forever he sat
[1:22:11] down on the right hand of God he made
[1:22:13] one offering
[1:22:16] forever Hallelujah from henceforth
[1:22:18] expecting till his enemies be made his
[1:22:20] foot stol for by one offering he have
[1:22:22] perfected forever all right them that
[1:22:25] are
[1:22:26] Sanctified
[1:22:28] hallelujah hallelujah brother BR said
[1:22:31] all the way from Eden job would make a
[1:22:33] sacrifice pour out the blood of a lamb
[1:22:35] and through that blood he would confess
[1:22:36] his wrong yeah may God be merciful to me
[1:22:39] now I approach thee through the blood
[1:22:42] that's what we got to come through the
[1:22:43] shed blood and there job offered the
[1:22:45] shed blood as he approached Jehovah
[1:22:47] knowing that God would receive him not
[1:22:49] upon nothing
[1:22:51] else huh maybe not be perfect English
[1:22:54] but it it makes sense to
[1:22:57] me we do not approach him in the name of
[1:22:59] a good man we don't approach him by
[1:23:02] works he will not accept that we don't
[1:23:05] approach him again if you're a born
[1:23:07] again believer there's things you'll do
[1:23:09] but that's not how we approach God you
[1:23:12] know you don't come up here and say Lord
[1:23:15] Lord I need healing today God I paid my
[1:23:20] taxes
[1:23:21] woohoo you know it's the right to do
[1:23:24] obey the law of Caesar maybe I shouldn't
[1:23:26] preach on that
[1:23:27] but it's the right thing to do God I
[1:23:31] didn't speed on the way to church
[1:23:35] today I'm going to approach you on that
[1:23:37] right today you realize that's how
[1:23:39] people come and many times our young
[1:23:41] people are the biggest are the ones who
[1:23:43] come the most like that it's like well
[1:23:46] today I'm feeling down so I must need I
[1:23:49] must need him and you do need him and I
[1:23:51] want you to come but look you don't you
[1:23:53] don't approach God God because of what
[1:23:55] you've done say well when I feel good
[1:23:58] enough then I'll start going to church
[1:24:00] that's not how we approach God when I
[1:24:02] get to where I'm you know everything's
[1:24:04] settled then I'll go to church maybe you
[1:24:06] young people say well I you know I'm
[1:24:07] conflicted right now I don't know what I
[1:24:09] want to do with my life and so I'll just
[1:24:10] stay out of church until later no come
[1:24:12] come to the come to the altar come to
[1:24:14] the place where Mercy is come to the
[1:24:16] house of God there's people here that
[1:24:18] won't judge you sure there will always
[1:24:20] be job's comforters yeah there's always
[1:24:22] going to be people who look down on
[1:24:24] other people but there's also people who
[1:24:26] love God and recognize that there's
[1:24:28] something bigger than what's going on
[1:24:30] than what they can see is going on
[1:24:32] there's a bigger God than what they even
[1:24:34] understand and so when you get in that
[1:24:35] place many times I see young people come
[1:24:37] up in a prayer line and and and I
[1:24:39] believe in prayer lines but we'll see
[1:24:41] young people come up in prayer lines and
[1:24:43] and they feel like they got to get
[1:24:44] resaved and they're looking for a
[1:24:46] specific emotional experience in the
[1:24:48] prayer line that's not what we're
[1:24:50] looking for right but what how do you
[1:24:52] come in the prayer line he said lay
[1:24:54] hands on the sick yeah and they shall
[1:24:57] recover so when I come in the prayer
[1:24:59] line I'm not coming looking for an
[1:25:01] emotional experience although if I
[1:25:03] believe that I've been saved or healed I
[1:25:05] might shout or dance or anything else
[1:25:07] yeah when I feel his presence it does
[1:25:09] something to me but I'm not coming
[1:25:11] looking for an emotional experience I'm
[1:25:13] coming looking by the word Lord you said
[1:25:15] you would heal
[1:25:18] me if I don't come on my works well I
[1:25:21] won't go today because today I don't
[1:25:23] feel good that's probably the day to
[1:25:27] go right I today I don't feel like shout
[1:25:31] see it's not put on you know sometimes I
[1:25:35] know people say brother Ben you always
[1:25:37] back the word well it's because the word
[1:25:39] is always true
[1:25:42] yeah right is it ever not true then I
[1:25:45] always back the word cuz I don't back
[1:25:48] based on how I feel right right I back
[1:25:51] based on if it's true or not yeah right
[1:25:54] I Don't Clap my hands in church because

[1:26:04] because he's worthy yeah you raise your
[1:26:07] hands because he's worthy
[1:26:10] yeah come on church we don't approach
[1:26:14] him in the name of a good man we don't

[1:26:17] prophet right right we don't approach
[1:26:20] him by works right we don't approach him
[1:26:22] and say Lord I know I know I know that
[1:26:25] you you know I believe brother brandom I
[1:26:26] believe in in a prophet in this age and
[1:26:29] that makes me worthy that doesn't make
[1:26:30] you worthy right right it doesn't do it
[1:26:33] what what do you have to approach him by

[1:29:14] we'd have is a bunch of dead lambs and a
[1:29:17] mess I remember I think I've told you
[1:29:19] this before but I remember when we were
[1:29:20] kids our neighbors we had neighbors just
[1:29:23] down the street but we lived on at the
[1:29:24] end of a dead end Road and we were out
[1:29:25] in the country but we did have one
[1:29:27] neighbor and we had some goats and the
[1:29:30] dogs got a hold of one of the goats some
[1:29:32] dogs come through and got a hold of one
[1:29:33] of the goats and they dragged it over in
[1:29:34] their yard they thought we were a cult
[1:29:41] anyway
[1:29:43] so that dog we found out through the
[1:29:45] grap Vine that the neighborhood was
[1:29:47] telling it they were telling everybody
[1:29:48] that we were sacrificing
[1:29:50] goats down there at the end of that road
[1:29:55] we were sacrificing we could have
[1:29:56] sacrificed every goat we had all you got
[1:29:59] is dead goats you can sacri
[1:30:02] church when you get done doing all your
[1:30:05] works all you got is Works say well I'm
[1:30:06] a good citizen that's good yeah when you
[1:30:10] get done with all of that you still got
[1:30:11] to lay your
[1:30:13] hands on the head of the Lamb right we
[1:30:17] come by faith and lay our hands on that
[1:30:19] lamb that is how do I do that I lift my
[1:30:21] hands and surrender
[1:30:25] I'm laying my hands I'm surrendering
[1:30:27] myself to the lamb that is already
[1:30:28] offered repenting of my sins believing
[1:30:31] that the life of the blood the Holy
[1:30:33] Spirit himself will come back on me to
[1:30:35] cause me to live a Christian Life see
[1:30:38] we've got to know that we were guilty
[1:30:40] but he has taken our guilt listen what
[1:30:44] uh Peter told them to do in Acts 2:36 he
[1:30:46] said therefore let all the house of
[1:30:48] Israel know assuredly that God has made
[1:30:50] that same Jesus whom ye have Cru
[1:30:54] crucified sir he said you're guilty of
[1:30:56] this crucifying the Lord both Lord and
[1:30:58] Christ now when they heard this they
[1:31:01] were pricked in their heart it's like
[1:31:04] somebody stabbed them in the heart when
[1:31:06] they heard the word of God why there was
[1:31:08] something there that could be
[1:31:10] pricked and said unto Peter and to the
[1:31:12] rest of the Apostles men and Brethren
[1:31:15] what shall we do how can I get out from
[1:31:18] under this condemnation how can I get
[1:31:20] out from under this conviction and Peter
[1:31:22] said unto them
[1:31:25] repent what are you doing laying your
[1:31:28] head on the your hand on the head of the
[1:31:30] Lamb repent and be baptized every one of
[1:31:33] you in the name of Jesus Christ for the
[1:31:34] remission of sins and ye shall receive
[1:31:37] the gift of the Holy Ghost do we believe

[1:32:11] token is the life of God himself it
[1:32:14] comes back in The Believer it's not a
[1:32:16] blood a chemistry but it is the holy
[1:32:18] spirit of God that is the token that God
[1:32:20] requires of the church today God must
[1:32:22] see the token he must see it in every
[1:32:25] one of us 1 Corinthians 12:13 for by one

[1:35:25] that he is a rewarder of them that

[1:35:49] every requirement that God requires I'm
[1:35:51] resisting the urge to tell you that I'm
[1:35:56] closing I I heard you brother Bill we
[1:35:58] don't need to keep saying it we just
[1:35:59] need to do
[1:36:03] it he still he lays silent remember

[1:36:27] your face without my glasses so it's all
[1:36:29] right Faith holds on to it not knowing
[1:36:32] what it's all about but it knows that he
[1:36:34] is and it's certain that he
[1:36:37] is glory to God remember if he is how
[1:36:42] many believe he exists today he is then
[1:36:45] his words has to be true and if he
[1:36:49] required you to meet these circumstances
[1:36:51] and you did he is obligated to take care
[1:36:54] of his
[1:36:55] word job knew he wasn't a sinner not
[1:36:57] because he was a good man but because of
[1:36:59] the

[1:39:01] better than you was when them preachers

[1:39:09] faith in the Living God that mounts he
[1:39:12] said not what the preacher is it's what
[1:39:13] God is the preacher never made the
[1:39:15] promise God made the
[1:39:17] promise it's not up to the preacher it's
[1:39:19] up to God and your faith to believe that
[1:39:21] it is God so be of God be certain that
[1:39:24] it's God that's God's word and God is in
[1:39:26] his
[1:39:27] word hallelujah when trouble struck job

[1:39:32] upon the only grounds that God will
[1:39:33] receive a Believer on the burnt
[1:39:35] sacrifice and the blood so when trouble
[1:39:38] struck his house God was a present help
[1:39:39] in the time of trouble when they accused
[1:39:41] him of being a secret sinner he knew he
[1:39:42] was righteous with God because he had
[1:39:44] met God's requirements he could say I
[1:39:46] know my redeemer liveth and at the last
[1:39:48] day he will stand on the earth though
[1:39:50] the skin worms destroy this body yet in
[1:39:52] my flesh shall I see God yeah he knew he
[1:39:54] had come God's provided way he didn't
[1:39:56] come by the membership of his church he
[1:39:58] come by God's sacrifice right that's
[1:40:01] what God required yeah we need to get
[1:40:04] away from the fear and the scare say
[1:40:05] well if I go to a certain church I can
[1:40:06] be saved nonsense if I sit under a pre

[1:41:59] that in his
[1:42:00] word he will oh church he will not put
[1:42:03] up more on us than we can bear if he put
[1:42:06] it on you he knew you could bear it are
[1:42:08] you hearing me this morning that's a
[1:42:10] promise of the word if he put it on you

[1:42:15] it look at people all the time I say I
[1:42:17] couldn't do what they're doing I
[1:42:19] couldn't go through that I don't think I
[1:42:20] could but if he ever put it on me it's
[1:42:22] because he knew
[1:42:24] knew he wasn't surprised by he knew I
[1:42:26] could bear
[1:42:28] it amen job went through trials and
[1:42:30] tests the children taken everything
[1:42:31] taken church members come accused him of
[1:42:33] being a secret sinner tried to say
[1:42:35] everything against him yet he wouldn't
[1:42:36] listen to any of it he knew he had met
[1:42:38] God's requirements he knew there's no
[1:42:39] need of Satan trying to tempt him he
[1:42:41] knew it was the devil and as long as
[1:42:43] Satan can make him believe his sickness
[1:42:44] was God doing it he had job whipped when
[1:42:47] job once struck that Revelation it was
[1:42:49] not God God allowed it but it was not
[1:42:51] God are you with me now let's get this
[1:42:53] straight God allowed it but it was not
[1:42:55] God God even recommended him but it was
[1:42:57] not God that caused the sickness it's a
[1:43:00] devil he said it was not God he was only
[1:43:02] going through his trial to make him
[1:43:03] something it wasn't God doing it was
[1:43:05] Satan doing it right the same thing
[1:43:07] today he'll try to tell you these trials
[1:43:08] and things is you're God trying to put
[1:43:09] punishment upon
[1:43:12] you I think he ought to just settle it
[1:43:15] it isn't so
[1:43:19] right I've had preachers tell me well
[1:43:22] this happened cuz God was punishing me
[1:43:24] It Isn't
[1:43:26] So no
[1:43:29] sir good he'll correct you he'll mold
[1:43:32] your
[1:43:33] character but he will not punish you for
[1:43:36] sin he cannot if you are under the blood
[1:43:40] if you've come through the door it's
[1:43:42] Satan doing that and God permitting it
[1:43:44] to temper you to make you see if you're
[1:43:47] I love that to make you
[1:43:51] see if you are are tied I almost said it
[1:43:54] if you are tied to this Earth by Earth
[1:43:58] cares yeah
[1:44:00] right I'm just going to close there
[1:44:03] brother
[1:44:05] Robert I got quite a bit more but we're
[1:44:07] just going to close on
[1:44:09] this it's you it's God permitting it to
[1:44:13] temper you to make you see if you are
[1:44:17] tied to this Earth by the Earth cares or
[1:44:21] whether your Treasures
[1:44:23] is in heaven yes for wherever your
[1:44:26] Treasures
[1:44:27] is there you are also
[1:44:31] right job was a
[1:44:34] believer in Trials he was a believer in
[1:44:36] persecution he was a Believer he was a
[1:44:38] genuine
[1:44:39] believer so what does that mean if I'm a
[1:44:43] True Believer and he's a real Savior and
[1:44:46] I've come his provided way he is not a
[1:44:50] liar he's not a man that he could repent
[1:44:53] he's not a God who fails sometimes yeah
[1:44:57] he doesn't lift one up and fail on
[1:44:58] another one but everyone who comes to
[1:45:00] him he will in no wise cast out right
[1:45:03] thank you you say well what if I'm not
[1:45:06] predestined if you were not predestined
[1:45:08] there wouldn't be a desire in your heart
[1:45:09] to
[1:45:11] come the very fact you have a desire in
[1:45:13] your heart is proof God is dealing with
[1:45:15] you sir and if you had crossed the line
[1:45:18] somewhere there would be no desire to
[1:45:20] come but if there is a desire to come
[1:45:22] Fellowship with me on this thought I was
[1:45:24] a sinner I was born in sin shaped in
[1:45:26] iniquity but one day the word was
[1:45:28] preached and my heart was pricked I
[1:45:31] believe that Jesus died for my sins I
[1:45:33] repented of my sins was baptized in the
[1:45:35] name of the Lord Jesus Christ I was
[1:45:36] sealed by the true baptism of the Holy
[1:45:38] Ghost with the evidence being that my
[1:45:40] desire changed and now I say Amen to
[1:45:42] every word of God and that Holy Spirit
[1:45:44] has led me into all truth this is my
[1:45:46] confidence we know musicians go ahead
[1:45:49] and come Romans 8:28 we know can we say
[1:45:52] it together
[1:45:53] we know that all things work together
[1:45:58] for good to them that love God to them
[1:46:02] who are the
[1:46:03] called according to his purpose right
[1:46:07] Hallelujah
[1:46:09] sir let's bow our heads
[1:46:18] together we
[1:46:20] know job said I know
[1:46:23] [Music]
[1:46:25] his friend said job you can't be
[1:46:28] sure you you can't
[1:46:32] be how could you be
[1:46:34] absolutely
[1:46:38] [Music]
[1:46:42] sure I'm sure because I come God's
[1:46:44] provided
[1:46:47] way if I get disgruntled with the church
[1:46:50] that will not separate me from God
[1:46:56] if my brother or my sister or my mother
[1:46:58] or my father forsake
[1:47:00] me that will not separate
[1:47:04] me from God why the door was
[1:47:08] open One Day by
[1:47:11] faith I remember and I've been here long
[1:47:13] enough now here at the church I remember
[1:47:15] when some of
[1:47:16] you I remember the day when some of you
[1:47:19] walk through that door and you come
[1:47:20] across the welcome M and things have
[1:47:22] never been the same in your life
[1:47:24] again you ought to hold on to
[1:47:30] that I was a
[1:47:32] sinner but one
[1:47:34] day I walked through the door and when I
[1:47:38] come through God's Open Door of
[1:47:40] Fellowship I walked across the welcome
[1:47:43] man of the blood and I cannot be judged
[1:47:46] for sin any longer so I will not listen
[1:47:50] to the LIE of the devil I will not
[1:47:53] accept the lie that tells me I'm being
[1:47:55] punished in some way for my sin my sin
[1:47:59] was judged in you Lord on the cross will
[1:48:01] not lie let allow the devil to lie to
[1:48:04] make me lie I know what the truth is the
[1:48:07] truth is I'm forgiven the truth is I'm
[1:48:09] redeemed the truth is no matter how I
[1:48:11] feel at the moment or what trial I'm
[1:48:13] going through I trust my
[1:48:16] sacrifice can we do that this morning if
[1:48:20] you haven't come God's provided way the
[1:48:22] altar is open we can put water in the

[1:48:28] trials of Life Lord I know that I've
[1:48:31] come know I've come across the door will
[1:48:34] not let nothing shake me Paul says what
[1:48:38] can separate me from the love of God
[1:48:40] tribulation or or or distress or or
[1:48:43] persecution or famine or nakedness or
[1:48:46] Peril or sword he said we we're counted
[1:48:49] as sheep for the slaughter that's just
[1:48:51] our life that's just the grab bag of
[1:48:53] life but in all these things we are more
[1:48:56] than conquerors through him that loved
[1:48:59] us for I am persuaded neither death nor
[1:49:02] life nor angels nor principalities nor
[1:49:04] powers nor things present nor things to
[1:49:06] come or height nor depth or any other
[1:49:08] creature shall be able to separate us
[1:49:09] from the love of God which is in Christ
