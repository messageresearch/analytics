his memory oh by the blood of the lamb [Music] we're going to pray in just a moment but i got a praise report back in the office that couple that we prayed for some time ago when i was at my grandma's funeral and the church prayed for them at the point of death and her organs were shutting down and she was having a baby i understand she delivered that baby yesterday and they're healthy thank the lord [Applause] amen he's still a miracle working god and we're believing for a miracle for this situation with this young man that fell or the limb fell on his head a child i can't imagine that being my child but there's power in prayer and we're going to pray but i want you to think about it and maybe wednesday night we'll approach the subject but the church was praying one time because peter and james had been put in prison and they killed james and peter was sitting there in prison and the church went to prayer brother glenn and when they did all of a sudden things began to happen and an angel went down and let peter out of prison that's what the bible says an angel let him out of prison because the church prayed and he actually showed up at the prayer meeting you still believe god does those things i believe he does if he's god and he ever did it once he can do it again now you may have a need on your life today and whatever it is if you just lift that to the lord and lord i i have this need or i know about this need i i need you to move in my life today i believe as we pray together that that need will be met today heavenly father lord jesus i pray that you would come and and meet every need today the scripture says that the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much lord we're not righteous by what we do or what we can say we're righteous because you have declared that we are righteous if we believe on your word trust your grace we're so grateful for that today lord i pray that every every person every situation lord every need would be met lord if it's healing of the body if it's healing of the mind if it's the healing of a family oh god would you just meet that need this morning lord maybe as your word is being preached today healing can begin to take place things can begin to happen lord and while we're together together like they were in the book of acts the place was shaken lord by the power of god may it be so here this morning lord and we can say like peter did he has forgiven me he's delivered me he brought me out of prison walk right up to the prayer meeting maybe so today we believe you're still doing these things today and we thank you for what you have done and what you'll continue to do in jesus name amen amen do you love him today amen such a sweet sense of his presence today turn with me to matthew chapter 21 and verse one thank you for the music this morning it's good to have each and every one of you with us i know several are out but there's a good good crowd here this morning but several are out brother al and his family are on vacation and different ones but we praying for them but i'm glad you're here this morning brother glenn is glad to see you back mr glenn's ankle's been messed up for a while and so it's good to have him back today and and each one of you in the house of the lord matthew 21 and 1 and when they drew nigh into jerusalem and were come to bethpage into the mount of olives then sent jesus to disciples saying unto them go into the village over against you and straightway you shall find an asstide and a cult with her loose them and bring them unto me and if any man say odd unto you you shall say the lord hath need of them straightway he will send them all this was done that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet saying tell you the daughter of zion behold thy king cometh unto thee meek and sitting upon him on an ass and a colt full of an ass and the disciples went and did as jesus commanded them and brought the ass in the cold and put them on their clothes and they set him there on so they put their their garments their outer their coats and they laid them all over on the the donkey they set him there on at a very great multitude spread their garments in the way others cut down branches from the trees and strawed them in the way and the multitudes that went before and that followed cried saying hosanna to the son of david blessed is he that cometh in the name of the lord hosanna in the highest and when he was coming to jerusalem all the city was moved saying who is this who is this that's what i'd like to take for a title this morning who is this i pray the lord would add his blessing to the word you may be seated jerusalem was always crowded on holy days and the jews had many holy days there was pentecost and and there was the feast of tabernacles and the feast of atonement there were many holy days that the jews had but passover was special passover was a remembrance of the deliverance that they had had from egypt and the jews taught their children and still do today that they should remember passover as if that they were the ones who were delivered and i think we can take that a step further because we were the ones who were delivered we are the ones who were delivered from spiritual bondage but they taught them that that they were they should remember it that way and so it was always a great time and the people would all come together historians tell us as many as one million people came in the city of jerusalem a city about the size maybe of jonesboro in that time and and a million people come to that city for the passover feast it was a memorial of what god had done and so i can imagine the the parents brought their little little girls up and made special dresses and and they brought their little children kind of like we would for easter and bring them around one another and and they would bring them up and and prepare everything just right and make sure that the meal was just right and everything was done just right because it was a special time and there's something about a special time like we're going to have on easter with a with a meeting and a special speaker we have coming up there's something about that that builds anticipation and so they always expected something to happen perhaps passover would be the time that the messiah would make an appearance and they needed to deliver they needed somebody who would who would stand in there against rome and somebody would deliver them what they didn't realize that god was not sending a political deliverance but he was sending a deliverance from sin amen and what we need today is not a political deliverance so the world is looking for that but what we need is a deliverance from sin what this world needs is a deliverance from sin because if you get delivered from sin if you if you get out from under the bondage of of the old man of the old and carnal nature you'll find that the the ballrooms begin to dry up and and the dance halls begin to close and the and the the drugs begin to not be a problem why people get delivered from sin we don't have a a problem with all those things we have a sin problem but the world will never we'll never accept that but we know a deliverance we know a deliverance there's a there's a god that we know and you say brother ben can you say that with insurance yes i can i can say that with assurance because i know it's happened to me the holy ghost is not something we talk about as happening in the scripture but the holy ghost is something with the same that happened to me the old psalm said i i was there when it happened so i guess i ought to know but it wasn't just an experience you understand but it's a change in my life and it's a change in your life and when it happens then you can look back and say i'm not who i used to be i've changed i've been delivered from these things that held me down i've been delivered from all these things that i'm not i've not come into bondage see religion brings you into bondage right and it comes when you say well if i come to church i'll obey this and this and this religion brings you into bondage but christ came to deliver you from bondage amen no i'm not amating myself but amen means so be it now something was about to happen and they didn't know exactly what it was but there was an air of expectation in the city kind of like it is now people know that there's something going on and it affects the mood of the world everybody you talk to everybody knows but eric there's something is going on people realize that but they don't know what right so something is happening something's happening today that was a junction time in history they didn't know it but the most important events in history were about to take place that week and we're approaching a junction like that too we're approaching the rapture of the church we don't know what day or hour that'll take place but we can see the signs all around us we can see the things happening in the world and we see the the trouble the earth is going through and and as we see those things the scripture teaches us that when you begin to see these things coming on the earth jesus said look amen he didn't say get in despair fall into depression begin to worry but he said look up amen because you're delivering stronghold nigh amen hallelujah so there was an expectation but people didn't know for what were the romans going to come in and destroy them maybe there was a messiah out there somewhere and there was whispers maybe around they communicated with one another like people do today and they talked they had heard of a prophet in galilee a man who had healed the sick and raised the dead the story began to come in as we'll see later of lazarus and how that he was raised from the dead that was something that hadn't happened many years it's been many years since a prophet had come that had that kind of a power and ability to raise the dead and so there was a buzz there was an anticipation prophecy was about to become history and it caused an attraction on a mountain if we could say it that way as they come to the mount of olives it was stirring and the bible tells us that the entire city was moved and that word moved is and the original is stirred shaken like by an earthquake even jerusalem frozen with religious formalism and socially undemonstrative was stirred with enthusiasm as by a mighty wind or an earthquake stirred the heat was being turned up huh it gets kind of warm kind of warm in here this morning it gets kind of warm sometimes people begin to stir people begin to move brother branham tells the story about when he was little about having an old uh a turtle and he said they couldn't get that turtle to move for nothing but then they built a fire under him and the turtle moved that's kind of cruel to the poor turtle but you understand that it'll there's there's something that'll make you move and the city felt that anticipation that heat that that like we're feeling today something's about to take place what was it god was fulfilling his word amen and this was not done in a corner as paul tells agrippa later this thing was not done in a corner it wasn't done in such a way where no one knew people knew but they still didn't understand so they said who is this he said he must be some said he must be a crazy person he must be some said he was a devil beelzebub and so there was all kinds of different reactions but there were some who believed you see god was fulfilling his word that's why the city was stirred and the people went to the religious hierarchy of that day which would have been the pharisees of the sadducees which were like different denominations there among the jews they went to the jewish people that day and they come to him and they said who is this and see the jewish leaders had to give an account for it there's got to be a reason why it happened if god sent a supernatural force into the world there's got to be a reason why it's there and the jewish leaders tried to give an account for it but they couldn't they couldn't account for it it didn't fit their program it didn't fit what they believed so they had to say he was the devil but the people said who is this they didn't understand that prophecy was being fulfilled the prophecy of zechariah 9 9 when it says rejoice greatly o daughter of zion shout o daughter of jerusalem behold your king cometh unto thee your king cometh unto thee he is just and having salvation lowly riding upon an ash and upon a cult the full of an ass it was exactly the prophecy that would be fulfilled right but you've got to believe when god does something or it doesn't do you any good right if god actually fulfills the prophecy in front of you you've got to be willing to say that was god because if you don't you'll you'll never be able to accept it and so when god does something in front of us we have to be able to say that's god and i want us to look at prophecy being fulfilled because prophecy did not stop being fulfilled 2 000 years ago right there's prophecies yet to be fulfilled and many things that have been fulfilled in our day i want to look at at the jews first there's a great example of prophecy being fulfilled and then we'll look at some prophecy being fulfilled in our day before we move on into our subject this morning now the jews is a great example and one specific prophecy because there's very very many prophecies about the jews returned to israel which we've seen in the last hundred years we've seen that all of you have witnessed in your lifetime prophecy being fulfilled and a few of you are old enough to remember when palestine wasn't a state i'm not going to point you out but a few of you are i see some raising their hands back there but see you can remember when israel wasn't a state when they didn't have a flag but now there's a flag flying there why of all the groups of people in the world if you look at the significance of the jewish people as compared to their numbers they don't match up why because it's god's chosen people right and we understand that today we're in the time of grace to the gentiles i'm sorry glad for that so glad for that but the bible teaches us romans chapter 11. if you want to write that down or go look at it romans chapter 11 teaches us that the the the scripture tells us that the gospel goes back to the jews that there will be a time when they will be saved as a nation now but isaiah 27 12 speaks of a specific prophecy it says it shall come to pass in that day that the lord shall beat off from the channel of the river and what he's saying there the lord shall beat off he's talking about a man would take a a stalk of wheat and take a stick and beat it right and the wheat seed would fall out right and so he said the lord should beat off from the channel of the river into the stream of egypt so he'll actually he'll actually beat it off it'll it'll have to fall to the ground and that's that persecution that would always come to the jews outside of their homeland and so he said from the river into the stream of egypt and you should be gathered one by one or you children of israel the next verse it shall come to pass in that day that the great trumpet shall be blown and they shall come which were ready to perish in the land notice of assyria and the outcast in the land of egypt that said there will be a trumpet blow and then those that will come which were ready to perish in the land of assyria now that's modern-day iraq and turkey and the outcast in the land of egypt we know what egypt is today and shall worship the lord in the holy mount at jerusalem now in 1948 there were about 75 000 jews in egypt after the establishment of the state of israel the egyptian government began to pressure the jewish community detaining expelling or expropriating the property of thousands and by the time of the six day war in 1967 egyptian jews had fanned out over the world but you know how many there are in egypt today how many jews there are in egypt today ten ten jews in the entire nation of israel go back to that scripture or entire nation of egypt i'm sorry go back to that isaiah 27 if you can 13. what did he say those that were ready to perish in the land of assyria the outcasts in the land of egypt shall worship the lord in the holy mount of jerusalem we've seen prophecy fulfilled literally in our day it said assyria as well let's go back to that picture if you will that's ancient that's iraq now and and especially the area of kurdistan if you see that and and there's very few jews left there but in iraq particularly which is most of ancient assyria today there are less than 10. jews in 1948 there were a hundred and fifty thousand you think about that what would make that happen he said well it was political forces it was all these things but there's a almost 3 000 year old prophecy that said it would happen you understand and it's come to pass and so it gives us confidence we know god keeps his word and if god keeps his word to the jews how much more will he keep his word to his bride to his people to his church god keeps his word and and so let's look at god keeping his word and we know there's many prophecies of the end time and you can go into daniel you can go to daniel chapter 12 verse 4. when you go to matthew 17 11 you can go to malachi 4 5 and 6 you go to luke 17 30. but i want to look at revelations chapter 10 and verse one and these are prophecies of the end times so at the end of the gentile dispensation the bible tells us that there would come something that would uh that would reveal the mysteries there would come an understanding of the word of god at the end time and and that would come and as promised and even if you go back in the old commentaries and stuff they understood that it was promised to come that there would come an understanding and yet the denominational world today is as fractured as it's ever been good people you understand good people and so it's not the people at all but the world the world leaders religious leaders are as fractured as they've ever been so it's much like they were on that day on this day which is palm sunday all those years ago when they said who is this right and they have they don't know what what to what to look at and what prophecy is to be fulfilled in this hour because there's many prophecies there was a prophecy that told noah to go build a boat right but if we go and do that today you know we don't have a promise of rain that prophecy has been fulfilled what did he say i won't destroy the earth with water again but i'm coming to destroy the earth with fire so there's got to be something that god tells us for our generation and we know the main thing is to be to be saved to be filled with the holy ghost you understand because if you're filled with the holy spirit and we'll get into that but he'll lead you and guide you into all truth right he'll show you what prophecy is being fulfilled in your day but let's look at this one because i believe this was fulfilled in our day revelation 10 and 1 i saw another mighty angel come down from the heaven clothed with a cloud and a rainbow was upon his head notice he was clothed with a cloud a rainbow was upon his head his face was as it were the sun his feet as pillars of fire he had in his hand a little book open he set his right foot upon the sea and his left foot on the earth and he cried with a loud voice as when a lion roars when he had cried seven thunders uttered their voices when the seven thunders had uttered their voices i was about to write and i heard a voice from heaven saying unto me seal up those things which the seven thunders uttered write them not this is a theme in scripture go back to daniel chapter 12 and verse four and you'll find the same thing where he said there will come a time this will be understood but not now right so he hears these seven thunders he said seal up those things and the angel which i saw stand upon the sea and upon the earth lifted up his hand to heaven and swear by him that liveth forever and ever who created heaven and the things that therein are and the earth and the things that therein are and the sea and the things which are therein that there should be time no longer and if you go back in the originals no more delay no more delay this is it they didn't realize it but this was it for them this was the end of the jewish as jesus wrote in it was the end of that jewish dispensation in the beginning of the gentile dispensation they didn't know it but this was it oh god if we could just recognize today people don't know it but this is it we're right there and you say well brother ben i i can't see that but just ask god to reveal it to you and then if you can't see it then that's that's between you and god i don't de-christianize you for that but this is what god has revealed to my heart i believe that in the end time that something has taken place and we're right at the end i'll say this if you can't see it you go be just as good a christian as you can be right and i say that to all of us and no matter you you may acknowledge the mysteries to be revealed and not be a real christian then you got a problem right you'd be a good christian that's the first thing but then we believe these things now now look he said and he swear that these things that there should be time no longer these things would take place verse seven but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of god should be finished as he has declared to his servants the prophets the mystery of god will be finished there come a time when the truth of it will be known amen and so i brought a picture of this because i believe this was a fulfillment in our day if we go back i say our day before i was born but if you go back to 1963 this was in life magazine in 1963 a picture of a cloud and it happened on sunset mountain in arizona around the time that brother branham was there and and he received the inspiration for preaching the seven seals and so he's there on the mountain around that time and then something is shown in the heavens and there's a there's a cloud now if you look at it in the next picture he looked at that he said oh that's nice but he didn't realize what it was who is this but something turn it to the right look at that it's christ and i think you'd probably get that if i didn't tell you and if you look at the picture we have of hoffman's head of christ it's christ it looks just like him and we know that that's an artist's conception but there if you look at the profile of it it looks just like christ and you say well it's just a cloud but see you've got to see what what's god doing there's many things that could happen may not signify anything many strange things happen in the world but if you see something happening like that and god bring a message out at the same time then you have to begin to question who is this what's happening on mount sunset god confirming his word and we'll move on in just a moment but i want to get this he said that's what all this noise is about notice it's god fulfilling his promised word again of revelation 10 1-7 and in the days of the sounding of the seventh angels message the mystery of god should be finished the hidden mystery of revelation 10 1-7 the last message to the last church age i feel like i'm echoing just a little bit on the sound maybe i'm just too loud i feel good i you know and lately i have i you know i don't want to call myself fat because i but my kids call me fat so i guess melody especially but she don't even remember when i was skinny i feel good i've been out walking and and and doing things getting and losing weight and not eating as much and that that always helps so i feel good and so i tend to yell at you a little bit more and i'm sorry about that but i believe we we serve a god that's worth shouting about amen but look he said in the days of the sounding of the seventh angel's message the mystery of god should be finished the hidden mystery and he said in luke 17 30 when the son of man shall be revealed and the god of heaven promised the evening time would have evening lights three years ago this mystery was a prophecy this brother random in 1965 because he had prophesied that it would happen in 1962 and a sermon called what time is it sir he said but now it's history it's past the promise is fulfilled what time is it sir what's this attraction god fulfilling his word now let's go back to that day there were three groups of people that saw jesus come in writing fulfilling the scripture three groups of people the first group was the smallest group and they were the real believers they believed that this was the fulfillment of scripture maybe if they didn't even fully understand it when they saw it later they knew and that's something we have to remember is people you're not going to understand everything right away right there's some things i don't understand today but you pray and ask god to lead you to that because the word is always right because christ the authority that he left us is the word of god and and that is god in in book form if we could say it that way and so the word of god is always right we always take everything back to the word but we believe that the word has been fulfilled there's some that believe now you say well it's strange it'll be a small amount of people what always has been in fact jesus told his disciples who were only at the end 12 and all of them ran away but at the end jesus told his disciples in luke chapter 12 and verse 32 he said fear not little flock doesn't that give you courage and encouragement today fear not little flock for it is your father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom not everybody can see it not everybody can understand but little flock fear not amen amen and and you find a place in scripture and i don't have the scripture this morning but it's jesus said jesus rejoiced in his spirit and he said father i thank you that you've hid these things from the eyes of the wives and the prudent the people who should have understood it and revealed it to babies amen amen see if you really want to know something from god you have to become dependent on him that's what a baby is a baby's dependent on god he's dependent on god that's the way abraham became became in the old testament he said i am i am el shaddai i'm the breasted one is what he was telling him you're abraham you're like a little baby you may be 80 years old but to me you're like a little baby he says depend on me i won't show you everything at once but if you'll depend on me i'll lead you through life i'll guide you if you'll depend on me but if you lean on your own understanding the scripture says you'll be like a heath in the desert you won't know where to go what to do you'll blow every which direction but if you depend on god you'll be like a tree planted by the rivers of water there'll be fruit come out of your life luke 6 26 whoa unto you when all men shall speak well of you for so did their fathers to the false prophets you say well if this was true that jesus was the one who was coming then men would speak well of him the pharisees would understand no it would be exactly the opposite because the ones they spoke well of and jesus he takes a turn of phrase there and says so did their fathers to the false prophets they spoke well of the false prophets they still do today that was the smallest group they believed him jesus preached in the synagogue at capernaum and remember his sermon was about eat my flesh and drink my blood that was a mystery that was a step too far for jews right because it was against jewish tradition and law but they didn't understand it in a spiritual sense jesus said something would seem to conflict with the law and so they he said eat my flesh and drink my blood and they were troubled by that i said who can understand this and he said if you don't like that he said what what what will happen when you see the son of man standing up from where he came well that just threw him and he and the scripture says that from that time john 6 66 from that time many of his disciples went back and walked no more with him most went back and then said jesus unto the twelve because remember he had seventy who had ordained his ministry and they all went back with the 12 and then said jesus unto the twelve will you also go away and then simon peter answered him and said lord to whom shall we go i love his i love his honesty i got nothing to go back to if i didn't believe this everybody got something they say is right but i got to believe something right and you're the only one who i've ever found that has the words of eternal life i get into that word and it tells me it tells me things about my family it helps me when i'm sick and in need and in trouble and there's a word for that god provided his word to us he said you alone have the words of eternal life lord you're the only one i can trust he says and we believe and are sure that thou art that christ the son of the living god look what was the attitude of this group as they saw him imagine with me that they here they can see there's a moving there's a rumbling coming and the true believer is standing there waiting on him as he comes down the mountain listen luke 19 37 tells some more of the story we read in matthew here it is in luke it said when he was come nigh even now at the descent of the mount of olives he's coming down the whole multitude of the disciples began to rejoice who did the disciples did amen why because they realized or there was something in them that responded to prophecy being fulfilled even if they didn't know it mentally because the scripture tells us that later on they realized this is what happened right and so the whole multitude began to rejoice and praise god with a loud voice for all the mighty works that they had seen saying blessed be the king that cometh in the name of the lord peace in heaven and glory in the highest but remember what the prophecy said not only was he fulfilling scripture but they were fulfilling scripture why because it says rejoice because your king comes to you rejoice because your king comes to you so by rejoicing they were fulfilling the scripture just like he was right and so that that had to take place now they were fulfilling the word the prophecy said rejoice they rejoice and so psalm 74 tells us let all those that seek thee i'm one that seeks the lord let all those who seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee let such as love thy salvation say continually let god be magnified see and that would not be strange to the early church they would understand i'm gonna take this off again they would understand what he was talking about because they did it amen but today if someone rejoiced in church everybody look around and see who it was so they could get rid of them that's a fanatic but let all those that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee let such as love thy salvation amen those those that love thy salvation say continually let god be magnified amen jonah was in the belly of a fish one time now you talk you say brother ben you don't understand my circumstances you don't know where i'm coming from jonah's in the belly of a fish that's some circumstances right there you talk about a trial getting swallowed by a fish because of your own stubbornness that's a trial to go through right there and jonah's going through that hard time in his life he says well the only thing i know to do is go to church i don't understand it i don't know why i'm everywhere i look well's belly everywhere i look i'm in the stomach of a fish i'm looking around everywhere i look there's wells belly i don't understand what's going on all i can do is go to church so he said okay by faith i'm going to turn my myself towards the temple and then he began to pray and as he prayed he said this he said in in jonah 2 8 he said they that observed lying vanities forsake their own mercy the whale's belly was a lying vanity the symptoms that he was going through the the circumstances that was around him was all lying vanity we look out today and see coronavirus we look out and we see all the problems that are in the world today all the the hate and the and the fear and the people have for one another and the racial violence and all the things that are going on but that's not us what can we do in a situation like that what can we do in a time when families involved in and people are involved in it be all around us people are stirred up in every kind of a way and we look at that and everywhere we see we see symptoms of a culture that's gone bad what do we see what are we gonna do he said but i will sacrifice unto thee with the voice of thanksgiving it's a sacrifice because i'm in a whale's belly it's a sacrifice because i'm going through some hard times life hasn't been easy i've been i know some of you have been through it i know some of you have struggled in your life but it's not been easy but it's because it's not been easy that it's a sacrifice i will sacrifice unto me with the voice of thanksgiving i will pay that i have vowed salvation is of the lord amen and the lord's spaking to the fish sometimes he's just waiting on you to rejoice in the middle of your circumstances and the lord speaking to the fish and it vomited out jonah on the dry land he said brother ben them thinks you talk about a hard to believe well this is hard to believe unless you're a believer right you have to believe something when you cross a bridge you've got to have the faith to believe it's going to hold and you don't even know who built it i cross this bridge down here by not far from the church the one that goes across the river you know if you cross that old bridge i think they're redoing it now i crossed that bridge of my truck one day i didn't realize what kind of bridge that was and that thing's 100 years old and it moves when you go across it and the concrete's broke and the water's rushing and i crossed that when the water was up and i said man i'm not crossing that thing again i drove the whole nine mile ridge to get out they're going to replace that bridge but you know we cross a bridge we don't even think about it most of the time we don't know who built it how close it is you don't go and find the bridge inspections what is that faith you got enough confidence in the works of man that you're willing to cross the bridge oh god oh if we could just have enough confidence in the works of god a god who created the heavens and the earth that he'll lead me to the right place that he'll bring my family out of bondage he'll bring me out if i can trust him he'll give me the desire of my heart hallelujah i tell you what church you just we're just about ready to break through i can tell we're just about ready to break through there's something about to take place amen if you want to see the word fulfilled in your day get ready to rejoice amen amen remember the story of the ten lepers in luke chapter 17 and verse 14 it says the lepers come to him remember asking to be healed when he saw them he said unto them go show yourselves unto the priests and it came to pass that as they went they were cleansed and one of them when he saw that he was healed turned back and with a loud voice glorified god and fell down on his face at his feet giving him thanks and he was a samaritan look probably the rest of them were jews the other nine but this one was a samaritan amen didn't even have the right religion for that day amen no wonder he said god would call these stones to raise up children to abraham that's what john told the pharisees god he'll bring these stones here's where people had no background at all had nothing a leper that had no background in the right religion at all he was taught wrong he was taught a different religion and but he fell down at the feet of jesus and jesus answered he said were there not ten cleansed where are the nine where are the nine they are not found that return to give glory to god save this stranger the samaritan he said unto him rise go thy way thy faith hath made thee whole you know what's interesting about that is that the other lepers could say that they obeyed the words of jesus better think about this for a moment the other lepers could say we obey the words of jesus we went to the priest jesus said go to the priest but this one amen recognized that thanksgiving always comes first amen worship always comes first people today try to live legalistically by the letter everything just right but they don't recognize that what comes first is your attitude towards christ you try to make everything right we want everything to be right but the one came back he didn't go down to the priest what did he get amen he said arise go thy way thy faith hath made thee whole and what that means is has saved thee he made thee whole it is actually done more than deliver you from leprosy the other nine were delivered from leprosy every one of them went to the priests and shown that we were hallelujah praise god we did what the what jesus required but the one came back and returned thanks and he was saved because of it the higher obedience was to give thanks that's why in obedience sometimes obedience he saul thought obedience was sacrificing animals he said no i'd rather have obedience i'd rather just have simple obedience and the highest obedience is when you get a blessing give thanks i think brother branham talks about a hog eating apples my mom mentioned this to me yesterday and i've been studying on this but you know we get bad about getting in a rush i do it i love to eat and you set a plate of food down in front of me and we were in africa a couple years ago and i'm sitting there in togo we only ate usually once a day and we'd snack a little bit in the morning for breakfast and we'd eat one meal about two o'clock in the afternoon because you had to preach that night you probably wouldn't get back to the motel so we kept a few crackers and things in the motel but it really agreed with me i like that that lifestyle because it kept you from overeating and things like that but every night we were going out and preaching and coming back and we got in the hotel and they set this fish they had to fish and i probably showed you the pictures they had the fish with the eyes on it and the head on it but you wanted the fish with a head on it because you knew that it was fresh you knew that that it was a fish for one they had what they call meat meat markets but you never know what kind of meat right so they told us don't buy anything at the meat market because it might be monkey it might be baboon it might be might be beef but probably not it might be pork you know it might be anything and they just hung it outside and you'd eat it and and but here there was a fish and they set that fish down in front of me and man i wanted to eat and two or three different times i started eating and the brothers the older ministers that were there with me looked at me and said well ben did you forget something i forgot to pray here i am going across the the the the oceans to teach people how to be obedient love god with all their heart and all these things and encourage the brethren and to see souls saved and i forgot to pray over my food and and what do we do when we pray over our food it's not that it's some magic thing when i was a kid i thought that if you didn't pray over your food lightning would strike you i had that image in my head i really thought that that would take place and it's not actually the case because i've forgotten a few times and so i know that's not actually the case but but what happens is you're honoring god you're about to have a meal that god provided he said well i went out there and it's like the old story of a farmer excuse me for getting away from my notes but the old story of the farmer worked on his 40 acres you know and and here it was all grown up and overgrown with brush and things he got it all cleared off and started producing crops on it and the preacher come by one day he said he said brother john he said look at these this wonderful uh place that you have the lord's been really good to you and he said kept telling him oh the lord's blessed you and and farmer john he just kind of had enough of it after a while he said you know he said you should have seen it when the lord had it to himself but it's the lord the bible says it gives you your strength to work eric you said you're planting a garden that's the lord that gives you the strength to do that provide for your family if you're gonna if you're gonna whatever it is that you do and it makes you grateful when you realize some people aren't able to do that but they forgot and brother brown talked about somebody i forgot to pray and they teased me about that but i was so hungry but and that's not a good excuse but it is my excuse i have one too but if you pray over your food you return thanks brother branham said when you don't do that it's like a hog at the bottom of an apple tree and the apples just keep falling and hitting him on the head and he's just scorching himself with apples and never looks up to see where they come from oh church we ought to give thanks today at easter time we give thanks because he rose from the grave now there's many that are not genuine what about those that are not genuine i may not get through all this today but we'll go as far as we can brother branham says there's been a lot of make-believe and put on and the reason i'm quoting him here is because that was happening in his time you know pentecostalism has had a lot of fanaticism around it and he said there's a lot of make believe and put on there was all around him because every time somebody come with a real gift from god for healing or something like that there'd be a hundred go that just wanted money and those are still out there today you know they want money because every 10 seconds there's a thing on the tv screen telling you to give right and and it's not the christian way to operate whether you're a message believer or not if we can't provide what we need to have church close to church as long as there's if there's not the money to keep the lights on and close the church you don't beg the people because if the people aren't giving in a free will way it doesn't be good to come anyway so it's got to be something that comes from your heart and and but they begged for money because their their heart wasn't it was charlatans so we would say uh hirelings is what the scripture calls it someone who just does it for the money or for some other reason for fame there's been a lot of make belief and put on you expect that god said it would come but what's it trying to do if there's a bogus dollar it's got to be made off a real one right you never seen a bogus dollar you know somebody you don't try to take monopoly money up there and pay for something huh if you did they'd laugh at you but what do they take they take a dollar that looks like a real dollar and take it up there and try to pass it off as a real dollar but what that means is there's a real dollar right they wouldn't try to pass it off you know we we have some antiques and things and old toys i collect old toys and old pottery and different things and and if you look at those things they don't fake the cheap stuff they fake the expensive stuff they find the most expensive piece and they fake that because there's a real genuine it's worth something they're trying to impersonate it there's a real genuine somebody he said you've seen people claim to have the holy spirit live in adultery and drink and everything else they haven't got it they're trying to impersonate it but there's a real genuine somebody that's got it got the holy spirit and god confirms his words with signs following now watch now here he comes riding into the city just exactly what the word said he would do you believe that today riding on a little donkey coming into the city here was the real thing and those who are not looking at the creed not looking at the temple not looking at all these other things not looking at the priests what they had to say those that believed him they were standing there with a palm in their hands a palm branch in expectation hallelujah they didn't wait on it the emotion to pass and then go grab a palm branch but the ones who really believed him were standing there waiting with palms in their hands because that's the only way they had been able to lay them in front of him they went and got palm branches not because of the emotion of the moment but because they believed now the palm branch is a symbol of victory triumph peace and eternal life in the ancient world jericho was known as the city of palm trees that's where joshua's great victory was the walls came down at jericho and in john 12 17 it tells us of a great victory and this this it tells us what had happened and this is the the uh the scripture in john that parallels with the ones we read in matthew and luke it says the people therefore that was with him when he called lazarus out of his grave and raised him from the dead bear record for this cause the people also met him why did they have a palm branch in their hands because victory had taken place amen victory had taken place now they they met him for that they had heard that he had done this miracle solomon carved palm trees into the walls of the temple ezekiel sees him in the vision of the future temple i can imagine if you can imagine what it would have been like in that day why did they like palm trees well palm was a giver of life if you were a weary desert traveler and you went on for miles all you saw was desert desert desert i've always people told me the beauty of the desert well it's only beautiful if there's some plants that somehow survive in it right because otherwise it's it's pretty harsh and so in in those deserts you're saying sand sand everywhere look rocks and sand and the traveler gets so weary that he's just about to give in just about to give up that was the condition of the world in that day they'd grown so weary they were just about to give in the the judaism had split into multiple denominations sects of people that would that were little groups of people that were split off from one another everybody was fighting and fussing and romans had come down and brought them into bondage they were they needed something they needed a victory they needed a deliverance amen they thought it would be a political deliverance but it wasn't but they met him because they heard here was one amen here's a palm tree and that weary traveler looks and he goes in the distance he can see there's a tree there's a palm tree just over maybe as he looks over the horizon he sees the top of the tree and when he sees it amen he knows he'll be okay hallelujah amen god hasn't done these miracles all through this 400 years we've been without a prophet here come a man named john but he didn't do any miracles but it made it stand out you understand it made it stand out when christ come here come the miracles following him signs fallen and why it made it stand out to the people there's a tree i see the tops of it in the distance so i grabbed palm branches my wife and i had an experience like that the other day we were at a place called dogwood canyon if you've ever been there they have a tram that takes you back through there now my wife would recommend the tram it's about three i think 3.2 miles back in there now myself i'm a walking kind of guy and believe it or not i like to walk and i had my family with me and i'm cheap not because i don't have the money but just because i'm cheap and the tram ride was forty dollars i think for adults so it's pretty expensive so for all of us to be pretty pretty high and i said we can walk that we can do that and so the kids they found a scavenger hunt that they could do while they were out there so they were looking for little clues so we had to go a certain distance before we turn back in order for them to get that but it kept them from dragging behind because they had somewhere they had to go and so we said we can do this we get down there we walk in and at some point going in you realize you got to retrace your steps all the way back out right and you reach that point of no return where you're asking the kids are you sure you want to get this i i they said they'd get a prize they gave them a little badge i bought them a prize man but they wanted to go on and so they finally make it and there's a 260 year old sycamore tree at the end of or close to the end of it we had to go at least that far about three miles in to get down there and then we had to walk the three miles out well that walkout was a lot harder than the walk-in and we'd seen a a a bottled water machine they had like a coat machine that had bottled water in it on the way up there so we thought okay we'll stop on the way back and get some water we didn't carry any water with us we get back man and we're just pushing it to that bottled water machine man it's going to be so good and all i had was dollar bills in my pocket i thought but i got dollar bills it takes dollar bills guess what it did you all know what it did it didn't take dollar bills put them in there and they'd come out put them in there and they'd come out well we might as well give up and we were talking about he was like well they can't leave us in here right it closes at 5. so they can't just leave us back here and and here we are being being taken and all these people going on trams bias you know just sitting there waving laughing at us you know they can't they gotta pick us up they can't leave us back here so we were kind of getting discouraged but in the distance when we left there's a restaurant there has outdoor patio and has some red umbrellas on top of it and we've gotten when we got to the water machine to where we could see the umbrellas you talk about an exciting time i said kids were almost out of the woods i could see the tops of the umbrellas oh church i knew it wasn't very far if i could see it throw them trees and things and all that valley if i could see it i knew i could reach it why did they have palm branches in their hands because they could see that god was about to do something they could see the top of the palm tree they could see the top of that eternal life they could see the top of that resurrection they could see it there would be many more trials before they get there it'd be a long road they'd be tired and weary there would be a dark three days and three nights there would be a dark crucifixion there would be a horrible time when when christ was laying there in the grave and they thought all was lost and his soul even went and preached to the preachers to the souls in hell but during that time during those moments they had seen the top of the tree and so they could know that god was still going to do something oh church if you just recognize what god has done for us in our day by fulfilling his word we've seen the top of the palm tree we've seen a manifestation of the resurrection we've seen god do what he said that he would do and so it gives us courage in this last mile of the road in this last little bit that we have to walk when it gets so weary we get so down we get depressed sometimes we get weary but we've got to realize we can see the top of it we see the tip of the iceberg we know the rest of us got to be there somewhere there will come a moment when we will not all sleep but we'll all be changed in a moment in a twinkling of an eye and we'll be known as we know hallelujah they held palm branches in their hands and they cried out hosanna oh santa brother brown said they were just waiting on the first move could we have that kind of expectation we got meetings coming up we have services when we come in here on sundays and on wednesdays can we wait like that just waiting on the first move and when they saw him start to come over the hill they saw the people begin to stir and the crowds begin together waiting on the first move they began to lay their palm branches down and cry out hosea waiting on the first move you never heard them say who's this coming oh no they knew who he was coming they knew who was coming they know what the word says there were also those who hated him and i'm gonna have to skip past some of this because we're out of time the real believer has always been hated john 15 and 18 if the world hates you you know that it hated me before it hated you brother branham tells us that they hated him because they were jealous of him and he takes that from joseph in the bible you understand joseph his brothers were jealous of him the bible says they hated him and then he began to tell them dreams and things they hated him the more and i'm skipping past i'm sorry to you following me on the things but i'm skipping through this but what was their attitude the ones that hated him when they heard this noise hosanna to the king i was handed to the king that comes in the name of the lord hosanna jose and all the screaming the priests ran out to see what this religious commotion was about and the people said who's this what were they for what were they there for friends a religious feast they were there to have church and didn't recognize when prophecy was being fulfilled the very god that had them to ordain this feast told them that he'd be there just like that and they cried who is it time hasn't changed people are designed the same as they was then luke 19 39 some of the pharisees from among the multitudes said unto him master rebuked thy disciples he answered and said to them i tell you that if if these should hold their peace the stones would immediately cry out i like that today the scientific theory of the modern so-called religious groups has tried to prove that this blessed thing that we have called the holy spirit is only emotion see it just don't stand up according to their scientific theory i would like to ask them this what makes them change now you understand what makes them change he's talking about the people who have the emotion now some don't but the real believer what makes them change what makes the drunkards stop drinking what makes the prostitute cease our evil life what makes the cancer and the diseases depart from the people and the deaf dumb and blind and the dead to raise up explain that is it emotion it has emotion with it certainly anything that's alive has a motion anything that doesn't have emotion is dead he said excuse the expression but i think we ought to bury some of our emotionless religion then because it's dead there's no emotion to it any religion that has not emotions should be buried because it is emotional jesus when he entered the city the children all of them all of his friends crying hosanna him that cometh in the name of the lord and those religionists of that they couldn't stand it it was too emotional he said if they hold their peace the rocks will immediately cry out see something must cry out because life was there you could see the palm tree life the third group as we're closing in just a moment those the third group was those who didn't know what to do they don't understand it he said there's something wrong with those people they're mad what what school did he come from huh they didn't understand see jesus never had any formal training never went to a college or was certified by a board of at a denomination what denomination does he belong to is he pharisees sadducee herodian that was another one of the groups in that day what is he he didn't belong to any of them he belonged to god because he was the son of god the holy spirit's not limited to any denomination it's of god listen it's for whosoever will let him come and partake of the spirit of life freely it isn't limited to any of us it's just something that's happened to us what's it doing in preparation for the resurrection preparation for the coming of the lord listen what james says to those of you maybe who don't know what to do with the stir that's going on with the the feeling that you have there's something happening but you don't know what it is maybe there wouldn't be anyone here that way this morning maybe there is i've been that way before you don't really know what to do with it james 1 5 if any of you lack wisdom let him ask of god and give it to all men liberally and abradeth not and it shall be given him that's simple enough isn't it you want to know ask god to show you he says but let him ask in faith nothing wavering for you that wavereth is like see if you don't believe you can get this wisdom he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed he said for let not that man think he shall receive anything of the lord a double-minded man is unstable in all his ways you can't just say well lord if you want to you can show me no you have to you have to want it and you have to believe you can get it right and james has the prescription for this double-minded man in james 4 8 he said draw nigh to god you know why we're here this morning draw an eye to god and he will draw night to you cleanse your hands you sinners purify your hearts you double-minded he said brother man i don't know what to do come to church pray read your bible look at the look at the things of god just just begin to do the things that are right you know you can't but god will honor that what did jesus tell him when he raised lazarus from the dead he said roll away the stone there was something they could do they couldn't resurrect the dead but they could roll away the stone hey man on our own we can't do anything but we can just prepare the way for him to begin to work in our lives live the best godly life you can if you don't understand come to church live for god go to church you don't have to go to this church but go to church seek god with all of your heart why not purify your hearts draw nigh to god he will draw nigh to you cleanse your hands you sinners purify your hearts you double mind if you're double minded here's a prescription purify your heart in other words make sure your motives are right who is this musicians come this is god manifesting his word among his people i would ask us to think this morning if there's those three groups still today if god manifests his word what group do we fall in are we those that believe those that hate it those that hated him or are we those that don't know but see we can know by the spirit of god john 16 and 13 says when he the spirit of truth has come he will guide you into all truth for he shall not speak of himself but whatsoever he shall hear that shall he speak and he will show you things to come he said brother ben i don't know how to receive that to be guided to be led into all truth well the bible tells us that too how do i receive the holy ghost acts 2 37 now when he heard this when they heard this they were pricked in their heart and said unto peter and to the rest of the apostles men and brethren what shall we do they didn't know and peter said unto them repent turn from your wicked ways repent if you're what you're doing is wrong first stop doing what you know is wrong turn away from it turn away from it if you it's been you you know it's wrong and many times even in this you don't even have to look in the scripture you know in your heart that it's wrong repent turn away from it and be baptized every one of you in the name of jesus christ for the remission of sins and ye shall receive the gift of the holy ghost how can you be led into all truth unless you're willing to repent and receive the holy ghost he said brother ben i've tried but if you come god's provided away and you come according to his word he will give you the holy ghost the problem is never with the word the problems with us because many times we come with reservations and say okay i'll go and be baptized but don't be baptized until you're willing to repent when you're willing to repent then come to christ and throw yourself on him i'm willing i'm not just going to give this a chance if it don't work no i'm going to let this be my life let this be who i am and let god work in my life you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost for the promise is unto you you say well that was just for them that there on that day peter's just preaching to them no that's not what he said he said the promise is unto you your children and to all that are far off i'm afar off from the city of jerusalem but i fit in this scripture the promise is unto you your children i'm so glad for that all that are far off even as many as the lord our god shall call even jesus said they can't come to me unless i draw on them but don't you feel the holy spirit drawing you today don't you see that he's rearranged your life and ordered your life in such a way that you could come to the word let's power heads together if you could play something [Music] i know it's just a simple subject today on palm sunday we talked about the things that happened on this day all those years ago the people don't change and god doesn't change the scripture tells us hebrews 13 8 jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever if you haven't repented of your sins or been baptized in the name of jesus christ for the remission of sins i invite you to do that today i invite you to repent now you say how long does that take you have to repent to you no you were bent to god you turned to god it's not just saying i'm sorry but saying lord i'll follow you i believe that you come and you died for my sins and i'm going to follow you from here wherever that takes me i'm going to follow you for those of you who do believe this is a time of worship it's a time of worship we should never let a moment pass by when we see god fulfilling his word it's a time of worship i shouldn't have to work that up brother allen or brother joel or whoever is up here brother david whoever is up here leading the singing that we shouldn't have to work that up you don't get excited because somebody lets you do this that or the other you get excited because he's here fulfilling his word and so we worship god for that reason heavenly father i pray that there would be those this morning that have given their lives to you lord we realize we're preaching not just to mature christians but even to little children old enough to understand right from wrong they're old enough to give their lives to you and i pray that it would be so today you never put an age limit on it lord i pray that each one in their heart would know i i've turned from the world i'm a christian i believed on jesus christ to be saved and now i'm i'm going to do what god told me to do in his word that's all i can do i may not understand it fully but i can do what he said i believe the fruits will follow that i pray that would be so lord may that be the desire of our heart i pray you bless every family here today lord jesus as we come in and we begin to pray and begin to see you fulfill your word and we prayed for all these needs but lord i know there's many things that come up in the life of a family and they have these young families listening today and here in the church and young children lord and they face difficulties in life financially and spiritually i wonder what to do how to raise our children how to whether to do this at this time or where to go to church what to do i pray you'd bless them lord i pray you give them understanding lord give them leadership give the dads and the men leadership in their homes give the mothers lord leadership in their lives and what to do or that they would know the right things to do and how to obey your word that's all we want lord we want to obey you we want to worship you for what you've done for us we come though we may have a whale's belly as it were all around us maybe in bad circumstances in life but we can still worship not because of our circumstances but because we believe you're a deliverer we've seen the top of the tree we know we can see over the horizon there's a place of rest there's a place that's better than this one there's a world yonder that we could step into that's more than what we've experienced there's something more there's something inside of us a deep calling and there must be a deep to respond you said in your word i pray you'd grant it today bless each heart thank you for these people and sitting patiently and waiting listening i pray you bless them abundantly in jesus name amen amen god bless you let's stand together let's just worship him a moment can we do that just worship him a moment if you need prayer the altar is open he's not too busy amen aren't you glad he's not here your heart's dry and he's [Music] [Music] reach out and touch the lord oh you're fine he's never too busy amen oh don't you hear your hearts right [Music] reach out and touch the lord as he goes by you know this song was written because there was a woman in the bible who had an issue of blood she had a she had some kind of hemorrhage or something in her body she couldn't stop the bleeding and she'd spent all her money the bible says on doctors and she couldn't find healing but she heard jesus was coming by and when jesus come by she said if i can but touch the hem of his garment if i can just grab hold of his clothes i'll be well amen that's the kind of faith we have to have today to believe if i can just get a hold of him i may not understand it it may not be perfect but i know if i can get in contact with him and you can touch to him of his garment today the lord is passing by as he as the word is preached we are taught that where two or three are gathered together he said i will be in their midst then if he's here then you can reach out and touch him could you do that but you just raise your hands to him and sing it reach out and touch him as he's passing by you can touch him by faith you don't touch him with
