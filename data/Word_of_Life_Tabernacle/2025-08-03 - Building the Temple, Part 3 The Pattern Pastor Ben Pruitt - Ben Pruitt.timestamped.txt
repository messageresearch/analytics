[43:31] for that. I pray Lord that we be Lord
[43:34] have the faith to reach out Lord when we
[43:36] have a need and realize that if you
[43:38] saved our souls you can heal our bodies.
[43:41] Give us joy and peace and all these
[43:43] other things. I pray that you'd grant
[43:44] that Lord. Pray that you'd move in this
[43:47] service. I I think there may be someone
[43:49] here Lord that's in need or or sick in
[43:52] some way. I pray God that you just reach
[43:55] down make a difference in their lives
[43:56] this morning. Move me out of the way
[43:59] Lord. I know I can't make a difference,
[44:01] but you can, Lord. I pray you would do
[44:03] that. God, move me out of the way and
[44:06] speak. We pray in Jesus name.
[44:09] Amen. Thank the Lord. Thank the Lord.
[44:15] 1 Chronicles 28:1.
[44:17] We just begin where we left off last
[44:20] week on the building of the temple.
[44:23] Today we want to talk about the pattern
[44:25] of the temple. 1 Chronicles chapter 28
[44:27] 11. Good to see everybody this morning.
[44:30] God bless you. Thank you for being here
[44:32] today. 1st Chronicles 28:11
[44:40] says, "Then David gave to Solomon his
[44:42] son, the pattern of the porch, and of
[44:46] the houses thereof, and of the
[44:47] treasuries thereof, of the upper
[44:49] chambers thereof, and of the inner
[44:51] parlors thereof, and of the place of the
[44:53] mercy seat, and the pattern of all that
[44:56] he had by the Spirit, of the courts of
[44:58] the house of the Lord, of all the
[44:59] chambers roundabout, of the treasuries
[45:02] of the house, house of God, of the
[45:04] treasuries of the dedicated things, also
[45:07] for the courses of the priests and the
[45:08] Levites, and for all the work of the
[45:10] service of the house of the Lord, for
[45:13] all the vessels of service in the house
[45:14] of the Lord. He gave of gold by weight
[45:17] for things of gold. For all instruments
[45:20] of all manners of service, silver also
[45:23] for all instruments of silver by weight
[45:26] for all instruments of every kind of
[45:27] service. Even the weight for the
[45:29] candlesticks of gold and for their lamps
[45:31] of gold by weight for every candlestick
[45:34] and for the lamps thereof. For the
[45:35] candlesticks of silver by weight both
[45:38] for the candlestick also for the lamps
[45:39] thereof, according to the youth of every
[45:41] candlestick.
[45:43] I know there's a lot of reading this
[45:45] morning, but this is really important.
[45:47] By weight, he gave gold for the tables
[45:49] of shoebread, for every table. Likewise,
[45:51] silver for the tables of silver. Also
[45:54] pure gold for the flesh hooks and the
[45:55] bowls and the cups. And for the golden
[45:57] basins, he gave gold by weight for every
[45:59] basin. Likewise, silver by weight for
[46:02] every basin of silver. and for the altar
[46:04] of incense refined gold by weight and
[46:06] gold for the pattern of the chariot of
[46:08] the cherubam that spread out their wings
[46:11] and covered the ark of the covenant of
[46:12] the Lord.
[46:14] All this said David, the Lord made me
[46:17] understand in writing by his hand upon
[46:20] me even all the works of this pattern.
[46:24] Pray the Lord would add his blessing to
[46:26] the word. You may be seated this
[46:28] morning.
[46:30] what David passed on or what he gave to
[46:32] Solomon his son would not have been just
[46:36] uh materials to build the temples we
[46:38] talked about last week not just the
[46:40] nails and the hinges and and the and the
[46:43] wood and and the gold but what he gave
[46:46] him was also a a scale model of the
[46:49] entire temple. That's what that word
[46:51] pattern is. It's actually a model of the
[46:54] entire temple. So he would have made a
[46:56] scale made it to scale and put
[46:58] everything that was would be in the
[47:00] temple would have been in the pattern
[47:02] that David gave to him. And so it was it
[47:06] was all the weights all the sizes all
[47:08] the furniture everything that would be
[47:10] in the temple would be in the model. And
[47:13] it wasn't just paper instructions. David
[47:15] said I received it by inspiration by
[47:18] writing. He said and then I made a model
[47:20] of it or a pattern of it. That's what
[47:23] that word means. And so it was an actual
[47:25] model of the temple. Every single thing
[47:29] in the temple was divi was designed by
[47:32] inspiration. And it was the
[47:34] manifestation of a vision that Moses had
[47:38] that God showed him what the tabernacle
[47:39] was like in heaven. And Moses built one
[47:42] on the earth. But that that tabernacle
[47:45] over the years, it had been hundreds of
[47:47] years since Moses had done that. But now
[47:50] David gets by inspiration the same
[47:52] vision that Moses had and he comes and
[47:55] makes a pattern of what the temple was
[47:57] to be. Now brother Brandon says if you
[47:59] notice Solomon never varied one bit from
[48:02] the pattern that Moses saw on Mount Si
[48:04] in heaven. He said Moses when he
[48:06] returned from his vision pitched the
[48:08] tent and made it just exactly like he
[48:11] saw in heaven. And when Solomon built
[48:14] the temple, he made it just exactly the
[48:17] way he seen the pattern, the type. He
[48:21] said what a spiritual application we
[48:23] could apply here that we are to never we
[48:26] are never to leave the scripture. Stay
[48:29] exactly with the pattern. How many
[48:32] believe that today? We are to never
[48:34] leave the scripture because the
[48:36] scripture is the pattern given by
[48:38] inspiration by writing and then that is
[48:41] modeled in our lives and in the lives of
[48:43] those who lived during th those days and
[48:46] and so we have a model and we have it in
[48:48] writing. Now and I'm I thank God for
[48:51] that. I thank God that he didn't just
[48:52] make it a written word but he put it in
[48:55] a model a scale that we could
[48:57] understand. We we it was written what
[48:59] mercy was and what love was and what
[49:01] grace was. But one day there came down a
[49:03] model. There come down a the house of
[49:05] God. The temple was there in flesh. It
[49:08] was Jesus Christ. And and and what God
[49:11] wanted it was displayed even in the
[49:13] temple itself. What God prefigured in
[49:15] the temple was displayed in Jesus
[49:17] Christ. And so we had a model or a
[49:20] pattern of what an individual ought to
[49:22] be in our day and age. And that pattern
[49:24] is not a preacher. It's not even a
[49:26] prophet. But that pattern is our Lord
[49:28] Jesus Christ. How many want to be like
[49:30] him this morning? Oh, I want to be more.
[49:31] I think of that song all the time. I
[49:33] want to be more like Jesus. I don't want
[49:35] to be like other people. I want to be
[49:37] like Jesus.
[49:39] &gt;&gt; So he talks about how that he built the
[49:42] temple according to the pattern. He just
[49:44] exactly he said like he saw it and he
[49:47] said we want to stay exactly with the
[49:49] pattern. He said that's the reason I
[49:50] believe that's the way the first church
[49:52] was patterned. That's the way the next
[49:55] one should be patterned. He said, "And
[49:58] that's the way everyone should be
[50:01] patterned, just the way it was at the
[50:04] beginning." So, do you see it? It was
[50:06] patterned the way God saw it in heaven.
[50:08] And and every temple, every tabernacle
[50:10] that would be built on the earth would
[50:12] be patterned after what was saw in
[50:14] heaven. What God had in his mind for the
[50:16] church, for the bride, what he had in
[50:18] mind for us in this day and hour. We
[50:20] don't just do what we do by accident. We
[50:23] don't have service the way that we do by
[50:25] some accident or some, well, it's just
[50:27] the way our culture is. That's not it at
[50:29] all. We do what we do. We preach the
[50:31] word because that's what God had in his
[50:33] mind. We we listen to the word. We
[50:35] receive the word. We say amen to the
[50:37] word because that's what God had in his
[50:39] mind. We worship in song because that's
[50:42] what God had in his mind.
[50:44] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[50:44] &gt;&gt; For us to do.
[50:46] &gt;&gt; Good.
[50:46] &gt;&gt; I'm going to show that to you in just a
[50:48] moment. Now, now he said let them, he
[50:51] said, everyone should be patterned just
[50:52] the way it was at the beginning in
[50:53] Exodus 25:8. God speaking to Moses. He
[50:56] said, "Let them make me a sanctuary
[50:59] &gt;&gt; that I may dwell among them
[51:01] &gt;&gt; according to all that I show thee." In
[51:04] other words, don't leave anything out
[51:05] what you saw in the vision.
[51:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[51:09] &gt;&gt; Make the church to match
[51:12] what you saw in the vision of heaven.
[51:14] Make the tabernacle to match what you
[51:16] saw in the vision. So he said, "Make me
[51:18] a sanctuary. Let them make me a
[51:20] sanctuary that I may dwell among them
[51:23] according to all that I show thee after
[51:25] the pattern of the tabernacle and the
[51:27] pattern of all the instruments thereof.
[51:29] Even so shall you make it." It's
[51:32] interesting that God wanted a perfect
[51:34] house.
[51:34] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[51:35] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[51:35] &gt;&gt; Right. But yet he had imperfect man
[51:38] &gt;&gt; to make him a perfect house.
[51:40] &gt;&gt; But see, it was just a a pattern. It was
[51:42] a type of something that was coming.
[51:44] There would be a perfect one come. we
[51:46] could become perfect by his blood. But
[51:48] the pattern that God had in his mind, he
[51:51] didn't say, he didn't come down and say,
[51:52] "Well, I'm going to build myself a tent.
[51:54] I'm gonna make myself a tabernacle." He
[51:57] didn't come down and do that. Though he
[51:58] did that in Christ, but he did not do
[52:00] that in the first tabernacle. He said,
[52:01] "Let them make me a place of worship.
[52:04] Let them let them make me a tabernacle
[52:06] that I want it made exactly to these
[52:08] specifications."
[52:10] &gt;&gt; So God wanted it built that way. In Acts
[52:12] chapter 7 and verse 44, we know that
[52:15] God, see, we know that God, you know,
[52:17] his ultimate gain, his ultimate aim was
[52:20] not to live in a building.
[52:22] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[52:22] &gt;&gt; How many know that this morning?
[52:24] &gt;&gt; God's ultimate is not just to be in this
[52:26] building, but it's to be in the hearts
[52:28] of men and women.
[52:30] &gt;&gt; Right? And so, he wanted to tabernacle
[52:32] himself in flesh. And so, Stephen is
[52:35] preaching to them. And he says this in
[52:36] Acts 7:44, "Our fathers had the
[52:39] tabernacle of witness in the wilderness
[52:40] as he had appointed, speaking unto
[52:42] Moses, that he should make it according
[52:45] to the fashion that he had seen,
[52:47] &gt;&gt; which also our fathers that came after,
[52:49] brought in with Jesus into the
[52:51] possession of the Gentiles, whom God
[52:53] drove out before the face of our
[52:54] fathers, into the days of David, who
[52:56] found favor before God, desired to find
[52:58] a tabernacle for the God of Jacob. But
[53:01] Solomon built him a house. How be it,
[53:03] the Most High dwelleth not in temples
[53:05] made with hands.
[53:07] &gt;&gt; Other words, walls can't contain it.
[53:09] &gt;&gt; A church, that's why we don't believe
[53:11] our church is the only one that's right.
[53:12] We don't believe we're the only ones
[53:14] that's going in a rapture cuz these
[53:16] walls don't contain the almighty God. My
[53:19] ministry does not contain all of God.
[53:21] These walls don't contain all of God.
[53:23] But God wanted to live in a people and
[53:25] there's some people in Hardy and some
[53:27] people in Africa and some people all
[53:29] over the world that believe God's word
[53:31] and follow the pattern of the word
[53:34] &gt;&gt; that God they become the temple of God.
[53:36] The bride in this hour has become the
[53:38] temple of God worshiping according to
[53:41] the pattern that he gave us.
[53:43] &gt;&gt; So Solomon built him a house but he said
[53:46] the the most high dwellth not in temples
[53:48] made with hands. Heaven is my throne.
[53:50] Earth is my foottool. What house will
[53:52] you build me? sayeth the Lord, what is
[53:54] the place of my rest? Have not my hand
[53:56] made all these things? Then in Hebrews
[53:59] 10:5, Brother Brandham always puts this
[54:00] scripture with that one. He said,
[54:02] "Wherefore, when he cometh into the
[54:04] world, he saith, sacrifice and offering,
[54:06] thou wouldest not." In other words, I
[54:09] the time has come that we're going to
[54:11] move away from the temple worship, but a
[54:13] body hast thou prepared me? Oh, he was
[54:16] the body of God. He was the Jesus Christ
[54:18] was God tabernacled in flesh. Oh, don't
[54:21] you believe? I wonder if we could say
[54:22] take it a little further this morning
[54:24] and recognize that the bride is the body
[54:26] of Jesus Christ. So we are God
[54:28] tabernacled in human flesh.
[54:32] &gt;&gt; Good.
[54:32] &gt;&gt; I know it's hard to understand because
[54:34] we're fallible. But what did he ask? He
[54:36] asked for fallible man.
[54:39] &gt;&gt; Build me a temple.
[54:42] &gt;&gt; And he didn't say, "Well, just do the
[54:44] best you can." He said, "Follow the
[54:45] pattern."
[54:47] &gt;&gt; But how does he do that? How can he do
[54:49] that? See, how did he do it? In the Old
[54:51] Testament, if you go and you look at how
[54:52] they built the tabernacle, they didn't
[54:54] just do it. They were inspired to do it.
[54:59] All
[54:59] &gt;&gt; right? They didn't just perform a duty.
[55:02] &gt;&gt; But but the the Bible says their heart
[55:04] was stirred up.
[55:07] &gt;&gt; What a difference it makes in a church.
[55:09] &gt;&gt; In a body of people, when somebody's
[55:12] heart gets stirred,
[55:13] &gt;&gt; right?
[55:14] &gt;&gt; See, our heart needs to be stirred to do
[55:15] the preaching. Our heart needs to be
[55:17] stirred to work with the young people.
[55:18] Our heart needs to be stirred to be a
[55:20] deacon if we're going to be a deacon.
[55:22] Our heart needs to be stirred to work in
[55:24] the trustee room. Our heart needs to be
[55:26] stirred to do things in the house of
[55:28] God, whether it's sound or video or
[55:30] whatever it is, let your heart be
[55:32] stirred. We're not doing it for a man.
[55:34] We're doing it for the almighty God. And
[55:35] so, whatever was done in the tabernacle,
[55:37] whatever was done in the temple, the
[55:39] Lord gave a willing heart to the people
[55:41] and they said, "We'll follow the
[55:42] instructions of the word." Exactly. If
[55:45] you got to force people to do it or make
[55:47] people do it, you'll drag them along
[55:48] like an old mule and they'll work, but
[55:50] they'll never work. Right.
[55:52] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[55:54] &gt;&gt; They'll work, but they'll always
[55:55] protest. A mule will do more work than
[55:58] anybody, but he protests. He don't You
[56:00] don't like to be told what to do. But we
[56:02] don't have to tell somebody whose
[56:03] heart's been stirred what to do. You
[56:05] just point them in the right direction
[56:07] and let them go at it because there's
[56:08] something in their heart to do it. I
[56:10] said, "Oh, God, put something in our
[56:11] heart that'll help us to do what God
[56:13] called us to do.
[56:15] Are you with me this morning?
[56:17] &gt;&gt; That's the way the temple ought to be
[56:18] built because the we can't do it by our
[56:21] own ways. We have to do it according the
[56:22] inspiration of God.
[56:28] &gt;&gt; Someone just want to do it themselves
[56:29] and make a mess out of it.
[56:32] &gt;&gt; Somebody that wants to be a preacher so
[56:34] bad
[56:36] they'll go out here and I don't say
[56:39] nothing to get me in trouble. They'll go
[56:40] out here and just make themselves a
[56:42] ministry.
[56:43] preach.
[56:45] &gt;&gt; That's not the pattern,
[56:46] &gt;&gt; right?
[56:46] &gt;&gt; The Bible says, "Wait on your ministry,
[56:49] &gt;&gt; right? They're just constantly pushing
[56:51] and want to be a preacher, wanting to be
[56:52] a something in the church." I say, "God,
[56:54] help us. Lord, stir us up
[56:56] &gt;&gt; to do whatever needs to be done.
[56:59] &gt;&gt; Whatever pattern that he set for us to
[57:01] do, Lord, if I'm a brother minister, the
[57:03] way you find out or whether you're
[57:04] called, I don't know where I'm going
[57:06] here this morning, but he said the way
[57:07] you find out whether you should be doing
[57:08] something is whether you can do it or
[57:10] not."
[57:12] &gt;&gt; Right? So if you're talented in a
[57:14] certain direction, maybe that's where
[57:15] God's called you to. But when when the
[57:17] opportunity comes, you don't push
[57:18] yourself in there. But when the
[57:20] opportunity comes and say, "Lord, let me
[57:22] be willing every time." You may not be
[57:24] used all the time, but every time I am
[57:26] used, let me be willing to do my best
[57:28] and give it my all.
[57:31] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[57:32] &gt;&gt; We got a lot of young people coming up.
[57:33] And I want you young people to
[57:34] understand that church work is
[57:36] difficult. And you're going to be the
[57:38] next generation of of church workers.
[57:41] And some of y'all raised in deacons
[57:43] homes and pastor's homes and preachers
[57:45] homes and and you know what it's like to
[57:48] sacrifice to go to church.
[57:50] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[57:51] &gt;&gt; You you know what it takes. You you
[57:52] you've been there. You know the hardship
[57:54] of it. You know the the mental toll that
[57:56] it takes and and the trouble that
[57:58] sometimes you have to deal with. But let
[58:00] me tell you this morning, it's worth it
[58:02] because you're not doing it for for
[58:04] yourself. You're doing it for God's
[58:05] people. Ultimately, you're doing it for
[58:07] God himself. You're not just serving uh
[58:11] serving a church. You're not just
[58:12] serving a function. You're not serving a
[58:15] group of people or a fellowship. You're
[58:17] serving the almighty God.
[58:19] &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad to be able to do that
[58:21] this morning?
[58:22] &gt;&gt; I think we ought to do it with a willing
[58:23] heart and a smile on our face because we
[58:25] know that the next generation, if they
[58:27] come along, we don't want them to run
[58:28] from it. We want them to be willing say,
[58:30] "Lord, inspire me to do what you've
[58:32] called me to do."
[58:33] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[58:36] If we gripe about it all the time, our
[58:38] kids aren't going to want to do it.
[58:40] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[58:42] &gt;&gt; Lord, help me.
[58:45] &gt;&gt; Look, this pattern would be a type, a
[58:48] place of mercy, a place of redemption, a
[58:51] place where he would put his name. Oh
[58:54] my, listen. God said, "A body hast thou
[58:57] prepared me?" He was with them in the
[58:59] garden, but he wanted to be in them. and
[59:01] he wanted to dwell not just in any body
[59:03] but in a redeemed body.
[59:06] &gt;&gt; And Satan had entered into man. Now
[59:08] Satan could not tabernacle himself in
[59:10] man but he entered into the bloodline of
[59:13] man through the serpent. And and in
[59:15] doing that in the garden and in doing
[59:18] that what did he do? He he he actually
[59:21] he actually made man a tabernacle for
[59:24] evil.
[59:26] A place where full of evil, born in sin,
[59:30] shapen in iniquity. Come on.
[59:31] &gt;&gt; Come into the world speaking lies.
[59:33] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[59:34] &gt;&gt; But now Satan entered in. But God wanted
[59:37] to dwell there.
[59:38] &gt;&gt; Right?
[59:39] &gt;&gt; And God could not dwell in a temple that
[59:41] was unholy.
[59:42] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[59:42] &gt;&gt; Listen, church, I know a lot of times we
[59:44] say, "Well, I want more of God. I want
[59:46] to be closer to God." Many times the way
[59:48] to get more of God is just get rid of
[59:50] the things that we know are wrong. We
[59:52] know some of the things that we're doing
[59:53] is wrong. Just let go of those things.
[59:55] Get rid of those things. Be willing to
[59:57] to lay that down and begin to do the
[59:59] word of God and you begin to find
[1:00:01] yourself getting closer and closer to
[1:00:02] God.
[1:00:03] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:00:05] &gt;&gt; He shoot He showed Moses a place. He
[1:00:08] said, "I'm going to make a place of
[1:00:09] mercy until the true temple comes. I'm
[1:00:11] going to make a place of redemption, a
[1:00:13] place where I can put my name."
[1:00:15] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:00:16] &gt;&gt; And this pattern would be a type and a
[1:00:17] shadow of Jesus Christ who is the body
[1:00:20] that God prepared and of the church who
[1:00:22] is his body.
[1:00:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. The believers at Pentecost became
[1:00:27] a scale model of the body of Christ. So
[1:00:31] he didn't just leave us the word, but he
[1:00:34] actually left a model.
[1:00:36] &gt;&gt; And that's what was so important because
[1:00:39] you know the the influence of that
[1:00:41] church lasted for a while, but then it
[1:00:42] sank into Catholicism through the dark
[1:00:44] ages. But now at the end time, he had to
[1:00:48] create another model. We had the writing
[1:00:50] of it,
[1:00:51] &gt;&gt; but we didn't have the model.
[1:00:53] &gt;&gt; Yeah. So God come down in our age.
[1:00:55] That's what the message is all about.
[1:00:57] The message is not about creating a new
[1:00:59] religion. The message is not about
[1:01:01] creating some kind of new idea, but the
[1:01:03] message is bringing us back to the
[1:01:05] pattern, back to the to make us a model
[1:01:07] of the house of God of what it'll be
[1:01:09] like in heaven.
[1:01:12] &gt;&gt; So the believers at Pentecost become a
[1:01:14] scale model of the body of Christ.
[1:01:16] &gt;&gt; And when John saw Jesus, he saw him
[1:01:20] where? He saw him in the midst of the
[1:01:21] lampstands. Now you remember this why I
[1:01:24] said it was so important when we were
[1:01:26] reading David had a vision and he he was
[1:01:30] inspired by God to write and he wrote
[1:01:32] about the candlesticks
[1:01:34] right the lampstands you know that's so
[1:01:37] detailed why would he detail the
[1:01:39] lampstands
[1:01:41] the candlesticks well it's because the
[1:01:43] candlestick would be a type of the
[1:01:45] church
[1:01:47] &gt;&gt; right the the seven uh the seven
[1:01:49] lampstands which is the seven churches
[1:01:52] which all come all had the same oil.
[1:01:54] &gt;&gt; All had the same fire. Right. You maybe
[1:01:57] we need to teach on the church ages
[1:01:58] again, but but you know the in the
[1:02:00] church ages, they all were lit off the
[1:02:02] original fire.
[1:02:03] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:02:04] &gt;&gt; Right. And they all had the same oil
[1:02:05] flowing through all seven lampstands.
[1:02:08] So they were not seven separate churches
[1:02:10] but one church in seven dispensation,
[1:02:13] seven ages.
[1:02:15] And so the candlestick was made exactly
[1:02:18] according to the pattern. So David sees,
[1:02:20] he says, "This is how much the
[1:02:22] candlestick should weigh,
[1:02:24] right? This is how much gold you put on
[1:02:26] them." Hallelujah. So the candlestick
[1:02:30] being a type of the church in Numbers
[1:02:32] 8:1, we find the original uh pattern of
[1:02:35] the candlestick. The Lord spoke to Moses
[1:02:36] saying, "Speak unto Aaron, saying to
[1:02:38] him, "When thou lightest the lamps, the
[1:02:40] seven lamps shall give light over
[1:02:42] against the candlestick." And Aaron did
[1:02:45] so. So he lighted the lamps thereof over
[1:02:47] against the candlestick as the Lord
[1:02:49] commanded Moses. This work of the
[1:02:51] candlestick was a beaten gold. Unto the
[1:02:53] shaft thereof, unto the flowers thereof
[1:02:55] was beaten work according unto the
[1:02:58] pattern which the Lord had showed Moses.
[1:03:01] So he made the candlestick. Oh, when I
[1:03:04] saw this, I just about run around my
[1:03:05] room because I realized, brother Bill,
[1:03:07] that the way he did the candlestick in
[1:03:09] the Old Testament is the way he
[1:03:11] patterned the church in the New
[1:03:12] Testament.
[1:03:13] &gt;&gt; Right? if he could actually make a
[1:03:15] candlestick that was patterned just
[1:03:17] exactly the way he wanted it to be. And
[1:03:19] when Moses made it or or the man who
[1:03:21] fashioned it was a maybe a worker in
[1:03:23] gold, he was inspired by God to have the
[1:03:26] right pattern and the flowers and
[1:03:27] things. And so God comes down and said,
[1:03:29] "This is the exact pattern of what I
[1:03:31] wanted."
[1:03:32] &gt;&gt; You realize what he did on the day of
[1:03:34] Pentecost.
[1:03:35] &gt;&gt; He come down and there was a
[1:03:36] candlestick. Amen. that there was a
[1:03:39] there was a a lampstand there and he
[1:03:40] looked at it and he was able he said I
[1:03:42] can walk in the midst of this church I
[1:03:44] can be it I can dwell in this church why
[1:03:46] it's exactly the pattern that I wanted
[1:03:49] and that first church pattern is the
[1:03:51] same pattern today
[1:03:54] &gt;&gt; so the candlestick was made in the exact
[1:03:57] pattern which the Lord had showed Moses
[1:03:59] &gt;&gt; yeah right
[1:04:00] &gt;&gt; if he patterned that natural candlestick
[1:04:03] &gt;&gt; don't you think he also patterned the
[1:04:05] spiritual candlestick the church Yes.
[1:04:08] &gt;&gt; Again, we don't do what we do
[1:04:09] haphazardly,
[1:04:10] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:04:11] &gt;&gt; But by inspiration
[1:04:13] &gt;&gt; and commandment,
[1:04:15] &gt;&gt; right? And it takes both of those
[1:04:17] things,
[1:04:18] &gt;&gt; so when we worship, when we worship as a
[1:04:20] church, we don't worship just by
[1:04:22] commandment, but we worship by
[1:04:24] inspiration and by commandment.
[1:04:26] &gt;&gt; And our inspiration is not to go outside
[1:04:28] of the word.
[1:04:29] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:04:30] &gt;&gt; Right. But there's got to be inspiration
[1:04:31] in it or it's a dead letter
[1:04:34] &gt;&gt; because the letter kills, but the spirit
[1:04:35] gives life. So there's got to be a model
[1:04:38] that begins to show in our lives. See,
[1:04:40] it's not enough to tell our kids,
[1:04:42] listen, Solomon is about to pass or
[1:04:44] David rather is about to pass it on to
[1:04:46] another generation. He's about to pass
[1:04:48] it on to Solomon. Are you with me so far
[1:04:50] this morning? You've been good to preach
[1:04:52] to. I I'll try not to hold you real
[1:04:54] long. I'll give you a little time off,
[1:04:56] you know, for good behavior.
[1:05:01] But but Solomon, when David gives
[1:05:03] Solomon a pattern, he didn't just leave
[1:05:06] him words.
[1:05:08] &gt;&gt; But he left him an example.
[1:05:11] &gt;&gt; This is what the temple ought to look
[1:05:12] like.
[1:05:14] &gt;&gt; Oh, I hope our lives today can become an
[1:05:16] example.
[1:05:17] &gt;&gt; That it wouldn't be just words. It's not
[1:05:20] enough to leave these young people
[1:05:22] words,
[1:05:23] &gt;&gt; but we've got to leave them an example.
[1:05:25] An example of what God wants us to be.
[1:05:28] And as as as elders, it's it's
[1:05:30] important. See, if we don't pay
[1:05:32] attention in church, they won't pay
[1:05:33] attention in church. If we don't worship
[1:05:35] in church, they won't worship in church.
[1:05:37] They're following the model that God
[1:05:38] built in our lives. So, I say, "Let me
[1:05:40] be on fire for God. Let me do what God
[1:05:43] wants me to do. Let me be everything
[1:05:44] that God wants me to be. Let me be a
[1:05:47] model of the grace of God." Listen, if
[1:05:49] God saved me, he can save you young
[1:05:51] people. If he brought me out, he can
[1:05:53] bring you out. If he set me on fire, he
[1:05:55] can set you on fire this morning. Do you
[1:05:58] believe that, church? Some of you elders
[1:05:59] say, "Well, I don't have I don't have
[1:06:01] any job. I don't have any use anymore in
[1:06:03] the church." But listen to me. You're a
[1:06:04] model. You're a model of God's grace.
[1:06:07] You're a model of God's forgiveness.
[1:06:08] You're a model of what God can do in a
[1:06:10] life.
[1:06:11] &gt;&gt; How he can change somebody, how he can
[1:06:13] make them faithful. You're a model in
[1:06:15] the house of God.
[1:06:16] &gt;&gt; Don't think that the model was destroyed
[1:06:18] because you backslid or did something
[1:06:20] wrong some a long time ago. But
[1:06:22] remember, just because you did wrong
[1:06:24] don't mean that model was destroyed. God
[1:06:26] was doing. He was going to show a model
[1:06:28] of grace.
[1:06:31] &gt;&gt; But now that you know the truth, now
[1:06:33] that you can walk in life, walk in it
[1:06:35] with all of your heart. Don't let that
[1:06:37] model be broken, but model the word of
[1:06:39] God with all your life. All your heart.
[1:06:41] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:06:41] &gt;&gt; It'll be an inspiration to our young
[1:06:43] people.
[1:06:44] &gt;&gt; Good.
[1:06:51] &gt;&gt; We don't just come to church.
[1:06:53] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:06:54] &gt;&gt; We are the church.
[1:06:59] How many understand that
[1:07:02] &gt;&gt; we don't just attend church?
[1:07:04] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:07:05] &gt;&gt; We are the house of God.
[1:07:07] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:07:09] &gt;&gt; We we we model forgiveness to our
[1:07:12] children.
[1:07:13] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:07:14] &gt;&gt; We model love to our children.
[1:07:16] &gt;&gt; We model peace in our home
[1:07:19] &gt;&gt; to our children. Right?
[1:07:21] &gt;&gt; I say, "Lord, help me." I think I told
[1:07:22] you here not long ago. You know, I never
[1:07:24] fuss with my wife, but if I ever do, my
[1:07:28] kids are around.
[1:07:30] Oh, nobody else does that.
[1:07:33] &gt;&gt; Oh, I know you all shut the door and
[1:07:34] everything, they're listening at the
[1:07:36] door, too.
[1:07:41] But it seems like that every time if we
[1:07:44] do get crossways or something where I'm
[1:07:45] grumpy, there's people around young
[1:07:48] people.
[1:07:50] And I've prayed about that recently.
[1:07:52] God, help me.
[1:07:54] &gt;&gt; I know there's peace in my heart.
[1:07:57] &gt;&gt; I know there's peace in my home. I know
[1:07:58] there's peace in the church. Let me show
[1:08:01] that to the people.
[1:08:02] &gt;&gt; Let me be a model of that. But the said
[1:08:04] the token had to be on display.
[1:08:07] &gt;&gt; Right? It wasn't enough just to have it,
[1:08:09] but to have it on display. See, they
[1:08:11] could have killed the lamb. They could
[1:08:12] have they could have uh they could have
[1:08:14] took the blood and set it in in the
[1:08:16] house. They could have done everything
[1:08:18] just how they were supposed to do it.
[1:08:20] But if they didn't put it on display, if
[1:08:22] they didn't put it on the mantel where
[1:08:24] it could be seen, where it was a public
[1:08:25] testimony, it didn't do anybody any
[1:08:28] good. But if it was on display, it
[1:08:30] covered the whole house. Let my token,
[1:08:32] let the Holy Ghost in me, I'm going get
[1:08:34] amen to that church. And may the Holy
[1:08:36] Ghost that's in me be a a a token and a
[1:08:39] and a reality to people around me.
[1:08:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:08:44] Amen.
[1:08:46] When the children of Israel come out of
[1:08:47] Egypt, they became the church.
[1:08:52] They became the church. Why? Because
[1:08:54] they were the called out of Egypt. And
[1:08:57] brother Brandon said, "Then being the
[1:08:58] church of God, God ordained a certain
[1:09:00] place for these people to meet in where
[1:09:02] there would be fellowship
[1:09:05] because God longs to fellowship with his
[1:09:07] people and among his people." Amen.
[1:09:10] &gt;&gt; Then God took Moses up into the mountain
[1:09:11] of fire where the lightnings was
[1:09:13] flashing, the thunders roaring, and he
[1:09:14] showed him what kind of a dwelling place
[1:09:16] he desired to dwell in on earth. For
[1:09:18] Moses patterned the earthly tabernacle
[1:09:20] to what he'd seen in heaven, a sanctuary
[1:09:22] of the Lord.
[1:09:24] Oh, I think it's so beautiful to think
[1:09:26] that God before he would let a church
[1:09:28] building be built, that that building
[1:09:30] had to be a pattern of his heavenly
[1:09:33] abode. Moses made all things after the
[1:09:37] pattern of the heavenly.
[1:09:41] &gt;&gt; Again, he said Moses followed the
[1:09:43] pattern that he saw in heaven and
[1:09:44] pitched the tent to represent it. When
[1:09:46] Solomon built the temple, what did he
[1:09:48] do? He followed the pattern that Moses
[1:09:49] by the tent keeping the scripture in
[1:09:52] line. And when God came to come to his
[1:09:54] temple for the last days, this temple,
[1:09:56] the Holy Ghost, a body has self-prepared
[1:09:59] me. The Holy Ghost fell on the day of
[1:10:00] Pentecost. The message was repent be
[1:10:02] baptized every one of you in the name of
[1:10:04] Jesus Christ for the remission of sins
[1:10:06] you shall receive the gift of the Holy
[1:10:07] Ghost for the promises unto you to your
[1:10:09] children to them that's far off even as
[1:10:11] many as the Lord our God shall call what
[1:10:12] was that a pattern
[1:10:15] &gt;&gt; right he come to his temple and that's
[1:10:16] the way he acted in the temple again
[1:10:19] brother Ram says Pentecost was our
[1:10:22] pattern
[1:10:22] &gt;&gt; right
[1:10:23] &gt;&gt; no one can say but that the church was
[1:10:25] inaugurated on the day of Pentecost and
[1:10:27] the same spirit that come upon them on
[1:10:29] that day Every time. Someone say it now.
[1:10:32] Every time.
[1:10:34] &gt;&gt; How many times? Every time.
[1:10:36] &gt;&gt; Without fail.
[1:10:38] &gt;&gt; Oh, I love that. In the Bible, when the
[1:10:40] Holy Ghost came upon the people, they
[1:10:42] acted the same way. Again, he said,
[1:10:45] "Now, we know exactly from the word
[1:10:47] which was recorded by the Holy Spirit,
[1:10:49] how the first or original church was
[1:10:50] founded and how God manifested himself
[1:10:53] in her. The word can't change or be
[1:10:55] changed because the word is God." He
[1:10:57] said, "It can't be added to or taken
[1:10:59] away. He said that's what the church was
[1:11:01] at Pentecost is the standard.
[1:11:04] &gt;&gt; That is the pattern. Do we believe that
[1:11:06] church?
[1:11:07] &gt;&gt; There is no other pattern.
[1:11:09] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:11:10] &gt;&gt; Right. There's no other pattern. Our
[1:11:11] pattern is not in another city or
[1:11:13] another state.
[1:11:14] &gt;&gt; It's at Pentecost.
[1:11:15] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:11:16] &gt;&gt; Right at Pentecost, not denominational
[1:11:19] Pentecost, but Pentecost of the
[1:11:21] beginning
[1:11:23] &gt;&gt; at in Acts two. He said that is the
[1:11:24] pattern. There's no other pattern. No
[1:11:25] matter what the scholars say, God has
[1:11:28] not changed that pattern. What God did
[1:11:29] at Pentecost, he used to keep on doing
[1:11:32] &gt;&gt; until the church ages close.
[1:11:35] &gt;&gt; Praise God. I love that. What the church
[1:11:38] had at Pentecost
[1:11:40] &gt;&gt; is her inalienable
[1:11:42] right.
[1:11:43] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:11:44] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:11:46] &gt;&gt; Everything he modeled, all the
[1:11:48] furniture. Are you with me now?
[1:11:50] &gt;&gt; The the way the lampstand would be and
[1:11:52] would shed light and the way everything
[1:11:54] would work together, the way he modeled
[1:11:56] it was the way it would be. And it is
[1:11:59] her inalienable right.
[1:12:02] &gt;&gt; Oh church, you say, "Well, it's changed.
[1:12:04] Times have changed. We can't have church
[1:12:06] like that no more." I say that's not
[1:12:08] according to the original pattern. But
[1:12:10] if we follow the original pattern, God
[1:12:12] will still come down and invest his
[1:12:14] temple with his presence. He will still
[1:12:16] come down and make a difference in life.
[1:12:18] If they had healing in the original
[1:12:19] pattern, there's healing for us here at
[1:12:21] the end. If they had salvation in the
[1:12:23] original pattern, there's salvation for
[1:12:25] us at the end.
[1:12:26] &gt;&gt; All right? If they testified in the
[1:12:28] original pattern of the things God had
[1:12:30] done and had joy in their hearts,
[1:12:32] there's joy in our hearts here at the
[1:12:33] end. That don't mean you'll never have a
[1:12:35] struggle. It don't mean you'll never
[1:12:36] you'll never have a trial. What it means
[1:12:38] is God's going to take care of you. He's
[1:12:41] going to make a difference in your life.
[1:12:42] He's going to change you and make you
[1:12:44] different.
[1:12:46] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:12:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You say, "Well, I'm what I'm
[1:12:48] going through right now. I don't feel
[1:12:49] that." You need to look at the pattern
[1:12:51] and see if God did it for them. If he
[1:12:53] did it for past generations, even that
[1:12:55] we people we've known, then he'll do it
[1:12:57] for you. If he did it in anywhere, at
[1:12:59] any place in the world, he can do it for
[1:13:01] us.
[1:13:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. What the church had at
[1:13:05] Pentecost is her inalienable right.
[1:13:07] Originally, she had the pure word of
[1:13:08] God. She had the power of the spirit
[1:13:10] manifested in diverse signs and wonders
[1:13:12] and gifts of the Holy Ghost.
[1:13:14] &gt;&gt; That original church was not organized
[1:13:16] by men. It was led by the Holy Ghost.
[1:13:19] &gt;&gt; It wasn't very big.
[1:13:21] It was hated and despised. It was
[1:13:23] oppressed. It was persecuted unto death.
[1:13:25] But it was true to God.
[1:13:27] &gt;&gt; It stayed with the original word
[1:13:30] pattern.
[1:13:31] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:13:32] &gt;&gt; Now, man is always trying the pattern
[1:13:34] after something else,
[1:13:35] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:13:36] &gt;&gt; Something other than the pattern given
[1:13:38] by the spirit.
[1:13:39] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:13:40] &gt;&gt; And you'll find in the scripture in 2
[1:13:42] Kings chapter 16, you can go read the
[1:13:44] whole story later, but 2 Kings chapter
[1:13:47] 16, a king named Ahaz. Ahaz. He was the
[1:13:50] grandson of Uzziah.
[1:13:53] And he went to Damascus. This is during
[1:13:55] the time that Isaiah was a prophet in
[1:13:58] the land.
[1:13:59] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:13:59] &gt;&gt; Because we know that Ahaz was the king.
[1:14:01] You remember that God spoke through
[1:14:04] Isaiah and he said, "Ask of me a sign."
[1:14:07] &gt;&gt; Remember? And and Ahaz said, "I don't I
[1:14:10] won't ask the Lord a sign."
[1:14:11] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:14:12] &gt;&gt; And he said and Isaiah said, "The Lord
[1:14:15] himself will give you a sign.
[1:14:16] &gt;&gt; A virgin shall conceive." Amen. All
[1:14:19] &gt;&gt; right. This is that same king. And King
[1:14:21] Ahaz went to Damascus to meet Tigle,
[1:14:24] king of Syria. So, King Ahaz was from a
[1:14:27] good family. His grandfather served the
[1:14:29] Lord right up until the end. And he made
[1:14:30] a mistake and got leprosy. But his
[1:14:33] father served the Lord with all of his
[1:14:34] heart. But King Ahaz was actually he he
[1:14:39] become friendly with the Assyrians and
[1:14:41] he wanted to be like them. He realized,
[1:14:44] you know, it must have been something
[1:14:45] for him being a king of Israel. There
[1:14:47] was a great things in Israel. The temple
[1:14:49] was a great building and it was a great
[1:14:51] palace, but it must have been nothing
[1:14:52] like Babylon,
[1:14:53] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:14:54] &gt;&gt; Or like Nineveh, like the great cities
[1:14:56] of Assyria.
[1:14:57] &gt;&gt; So when he goes up to the king of
[1:14:59] Assyria and he saw an altar and he and
[1:15:03] he sees the way that they worship and he
[1:15:05] sees the manner of everything that
[1:15:07] they're doing and he goes up there and
[1:15:09] he begins to look around and say, "My
[1:15:11] goodness, this is so much bigger than
[1:15:12] what we have, so much better than what
[1:15:15] we have. So much so much good could be
[1:15:17] done with with this style of worship.
[1:15:19] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:15:19] &gt;&gt; And so what he does is he comes back and
[1:15:22] he comes back to Jerusalem or he
[1:15:24] actually before he leaves Damascus,
[1:15:27] Syria, he comes back into Jerusalem and
[1:15:29] he sees the great one Damascus is one of
[1:15:32] the great cities of the world, Nineveh
[1:15:33] and Babylon, all those great cities like
[1:15:35] that. And he sees Damascus in the way
[1:15:37] that they do things. And King Ahaz sent
[1:15:40] to Uriah the priest the fashion of the
[1:15:42] altar. Now remember, David gave Solomon
[1:15:46] a pattern.
[1:15:47] &gt;&gt; And Solomon followed that pattern
[1:15:49] exactly.
[1:15:50] &gt;&gt; Said, "This is how we worship,
[1:15:52] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:15:52] &gt;&gt; This is how we have church."
[1:15:54] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:15:54] &gt;&gt; This is what God wants.
[1:15:56] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:15:56] &gt;&gt; And here comes the king along and says,
[1:15:58] "Boy, I tell you what, these guys are
[1:16:00] doing things pretty good."
[1:16:01] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:16:02] &gt;&gt; I think we need to be more like them.
[1:16:04] And so he sends a letter back to Uriah
[1:16:06] the priest who evidently was a hierling
[1:16:09] &gt;&gt; because a real priest ought to have been
[1:16:10] able to withstand the king and say no
[1:16:12] matter what you say we're not going to
[1:16:14] worship like that.
[1:16:15] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:16:16] &gt;&gt; But the king goes down and he's he sees
[1:16:18] the he sees the fashion of the altar.
[1:16:19] Now remember this is a son of David.
[1:16:22] &gt;&gt; This is the king of Judah.
[1:16:23] &gt;&gt; Yeah
[1:16:23] &gt;&gt; in the lineage of David. But he goes
[1:16:26] down to Damascus. He sees the pattern of
[1:16:28] the altar according to all the
[1:16:29] workmanship thereof. And Uriah the
[1:16:32] priest built an altar according to all
[1:16:34] that king Ahaz had sent from Damascus.
[1:16:37] &gt;&gt; So Uriah the priest made it against King
[1:16:39] Ahaz came from Damascus. In other words,
[1:16:41] he made it before King Ahaz come back.
[1:16:44] So he thought this will please the king.
[1:16:46] &gt;&gt; So we'll change the temple.
[1:16:49] &gt;&gt; Oh church,
[1:16:51] &gt;&gt; we'll change the pattern
[1:16:53] &gt;&gt; so that it
[1:16:55] &gt;&gt; brother Brandon said in the first church
[1:16:57] age what happened? He said the mayor of
[1:16:58] the city started coming and people that
[1:17:00] were affluent started coming and they
[1:17:02] didn't want to be identified with people
[1:17:04] who shouted and spoke in tongues and and
[1:17:06] worshiped and prayed all night long and
[1:17:08] and bunch of slaves and cast off. They
[1:17:10] didn't want to be identified with people
[1:17:11] like that. And so they begin to change
[1:17:13] the way they worshiped to fit the gods
[1:17:15] of the land that they were in. And
[1:17:17] pretty soon the worship become Roman.
[1:17:19] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:17:20] &gt;&gt; And they found they were worshiping
[1:17:22] devils. Not even worshiping God.
[1:17:24] &gt;&gt; Thinking they were worshiping God. good
[1:17:27] &gt;&gt; and become what today we have in modern
[1:17:29] Catholicism. I'm going to talk a little
[1:17:30] bit more about that as it pertains to
[1:17:32] communion tonight. But the pattern got
[1:17:35] broken because a a man in a position of
[1:17:38] power saw the way other people were
[1:17:41] doing it and said we need to do it that
[1:17:43] way. I say God help me to be humble. God
[1:17:46] help all of us to be humble to the word
[1:17:48] of God and say we need to worship
[1:17:49] according to the way that God gave us to
[1:17:52] worship according to the original
[1:17:53] pattern.
[1:17:55] Good.
[1:18:01] &gt;&gt; This king was the son of a great king
[1:18:04] who served God with all of his heart.
[1:18:06] &gt;&gt; But there was something about that
[1:18:07] second and third generation coming down.
[1:18:10] He just lost sight of what God wanted.
[1:18:14] The Bible says when when the king was
[1:18:15] come from Damascus,
[1:18:17] &gt;&gt; the king saw the altar and the king
[1:18:20] approached to the altar
[1:18:22] &gt;&gt; and offered
[1:18:24] there on
[1:18:27] nothing happened.
[1:18:30] &gt;&gt; Fire didn't fall out of from God out of
[1:18:32] heaven and consume him.
[1:18:33] &gt;&gt; He thought he got by with it real well.
[1:18:38] But if you fast forward about 150 years,
[1:18:43] &gt;&gt; this is why we need to stay with the
[1:18:44] word.
[1:18:46] &gt;&gt; Listen, church, it may look like sir
[1:18:48] &gt;&gt; that people of the world build their
[1:18:50] families and they conduct their lives
[1:18:52] differently and better than we do.
[1:18:54] &gt;&gt; Oh God, it may look like that the
[1:18:57] pattern of the world is the way to go.
[1:19:00] &gt;&gt; But that's not our pattern. God didn't
[1:19:02] call us to that. It may work for some
[1:19:05] nominal churches. It may work for some
[1:19:07] places, but it doesn't work for the
[1:19:09] people of God.
[1:19:10] &gt;&gt; It would work maybe in Damascus, they
[1:19:12] never have any trouble. But Jerusalem,
[1:19:14] God wouldn't stand for it.
[1:19:18] &gt;&gt; If you fast forward 150 years or so, the
[1:19:21] temple had been destroyed
[1:19:24] &gt;&gt; by the Babylonians
[1:19:26] because of their idolatry and unbelief.
[1:19:28] And Ezekiel is taken in captivity.
[1:19:32] In Ezekiel chapter 43, he's taken into
[1:19:35] captivity. God showed him what all they
[1:19:36] were doing in the temple. Why they fell?
[1:19:39] &gt;&gt; Why they ended up where they were at
[1:19:41] because they started following the
[1:19:42] pattern of everywhere else instead of
[1:19:44] the pattern the word of God.
[1:19:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:46] &gt;&gt; Listen to me, church. You can pattern
[1:19:47] your life so much around social media
[1:19:49] and not even realize you're doing it.
[1:19:52] &gt;&gt; Because you just consume so much of it.
[1:19:55] &gt;&gt; You can pattern your life around
[1:19:56] television until you just don't even
[1:19:58] realize what you're doing.
[1:20:00] &gt;&gt; Huh? And our kids even end up thinking,
[1:20:02] well, we're going to go out and and and
[1:20:04] move in with somebody, live with them
[1:20:05] because that's what they've seen.
[1:20:07] &gt;&gt; Come on,
[1:20:08] &gt;&gt; but that's not the pattern of the word.
[1:20:09] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[1:20:11] &gt;&gt; Right. We don't do those things.
[1:20:14] &gt;&gt; We want to stay with the pattern.
[1:20:18] &gt;&gt; Oh, God, help us today. If you'll stay
[1:20:19] with the pattern, young man, if you'll
[1:20:21] stay with the pattern and wait to kiss
[1:20:23] that girl until you come to the altar,
[1:20:26] &gt;&gt; God will bless your marriage.
[1:20:28] &gt;&gt; It'll make a difference in your life.
[1:20:30] You young ladies, if you'll follow the
[1:20:31] pattern and not let that boy get too
[1:20:33] close to you, I don't know why I'm
[1:20:34] saying this this morning, but you just
[1:20:36] follow the pattern. Be just as close to
[1:20:38] the word as you can be. Follow the
[1:20:41] pattern. You said, "Well, so and so
[1:20:42] didn't do it, and they were okay. And so
[1:20:43] and so, let's follow the pattern just as
[1:20:45] close as we can."
[1:20:47] &gt;&gt; Yes, there's grace. Yes, there's mercy.
[1:20:49] But there's a value in following the
[1:20:51] pattern
[1:20:52] &gt;&gt; of God's word. something great about it,
[1:20:57] &gt;&gt; man. If you'll treat your wives the way
[1:20:59] God showed us in the pattern,
[1:21:01] &gt;&gt; things our homes will be a whole lot
[1:21:02] different.
[1:21:03] &gt;&gt; If we'll love our wives as Christ loved
[1:21:05] the church, it'll make a difference. If
[1:21:07] we conduct our we discipline our
[1:21:09] children, not the way somebody told us
[1:21:10] to, not the according to our own family
[1:21:13] tree, but the way God put it in the
[1:21:14] Bible, it make a difference. What is it?
[1:21:16] according to the pattern.
[1:21:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It shouldn't be just our
[1:21:22] services, but our whole lives. He said,
[1:21:25] "I can't dwell in a temple made of
[1:21:27] stone. I want to dwell in a house of
[1:21:29] flesh,
[1:21:30] &gt;&gt; a redeemed temple."
[1:21:34] And Ezekiel was shown the pattern after
[1:21:37] all the destruction.
[1:21:39] And the spirit took him up. He said in
[1:21:41] verse 5, Ezekiel 43:5
[1:21:44] brought me into the inner court and
[1:21:45] behold the glory of the Lord filled the
[1:21:49] house.
[1:21:50] And I heard him speaking unto me out of
[1:21:52] the house. And the man stood by me. He
[1:21:56] said unto me, son of man, the place of
[1:21:57] my throne, the place of the souls of my
[1:21:59] feet, where I will dwell in the midst of
[1:22:01] the children of Israel forever. What's
[1:22:03] he doing? Showing a pattern again.
[1:22:05] &gt;&gt; Showing what God wanted again.
[1:22:07] &gt;&gt; Right. Right.
[1:22:10] These aren't dos and don'ts. These
[1:22:11] aren't rules. These aren't This isn't a
[1:22:14] book of rules. It's not legalism.
[1:22:15] Listen, if you rule run a church by
[1:22:17] legalism,
[1:22:19] somebody's going to fail.
[1:22:20] &gt;&gt; And it's probably going to be the one
[1:22:21] making the rules,
[1:22:24] &gt;&gt; right? You start measuring things and
[1:22:25] and trying to make things everything
[1:22:27] just be exactly right. But what pattern
[1:22:29] do we want you to follow? Not the
[1:22:30] pattern of the pastor. Not even the
[1:22:32] pattern of the church. Follow the
[1:22:33] pattern of the word. Get a revelation of
[1:22:35] what God brought in this day. revelation
[1:22:38] of the message of the hour. Follow that
[1:22:39] pattern. I've told parents, you may not
[1:22:41] want to necessarily do exactly as I've
[1:22:43] done with my children. I got good
[1:22:45] children. They've stayed in the house of
[1:22:46] God and love the Lord, and I appreciate
[1:22:48] that with all of my heart, but don't do
[1:22:50] just what I've done. You do what the
[1:22:52] word says to do.
[1:22:55] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:23:00] &gt;&gt; Look what he says.
[1:23:02] He said that I will dwell in the midst
[1:23:04] of the children forever and their the
[1:23:06] house of Israel no more defile neither
[1:23:07] they nor their kings by their whoredom
[1:23:09] nor by the carcasses of their kings in
[1:23:10] their high places.
[1:23:14] Look at that the vivid language that he
[1:23:15] uses. He said in their setting of their
[1:23:19] threshold
[1:23:21] by my threshold.
[1:23:24] &gt;&gt; So God said I had a way to build it
[1:23:28] and they just changed the plans.
[1:23:34] their post by my post. The wall between
[1:23:38] me and them.
[1:23:40] Oh, church. They thought they were
[1:23:41] building a wonderful place of worship.
[1:23:44] And they actually built a wall.
[1:23:50] &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, I'm going to worship the
[1:23:51] way I want to. I'm going to do what I
[1:23:53] want to do. I'm not going to submit to
[1:23:54] the word of God." Do you realize what
[1:23:55] you're doing? You're actually building a
[1:23:57] wall between you and the holy place.
[1:23:59] You're building a wall between you and
[1:24:01] the presence of God. I say, "Let's tear
[1:24:02] down those walls today and do it the way
[1:24:04] the word says do it."
[1:24:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:10] &gt;&gt; He said, "They set the wall between me
[1:24:11] and them. They have even defiled my holy
[1:24:13] name by their abominations that they've
[1:24:14] committed. Wherefore I have consumed
[1:24:16] them in mine anger.
[1:24:18] &gt;&gt; Now let them put away their whoredom and
[1:24:19] the carcasses of their kings far from
[1:24:21] me. I will dwell in the midst of them
[1:24:23] forever. Thou son of man, show the house
[1:24:26] to the house of Israel." All
[1:24:28] &gt;&gt; right. Hallelujah.
[1:24:30] &gt;&gt; He said, "I want you to show them. I
[1:24:32] want you to tell them. Build a pattern
[1:24:34] with your words. Tell them
[1:24:36] &gt;&gt; what it ought to be like."
[1:24:40] &gt;&gt; And let them measure. They may be
[1:24:41] ashamed of their iniquities. Let them
[1:24:42] measure the pattern. And if they be
[1:24:44] ashamed of all that they have done, show
[1:24:46] them the form of the house and the
[1:24:48] fashion thereof, and the goings out
[1:24:50] thereof, and the comingings in thereof,
[1:24:51] and all the forms thereof, all the
[1:24:53] ordinance thereof, all the forms, and
[1:24:54] the laws, and write it on their sight.
[1:24:56] They write it in their sight that let me
[1:24:57] keep the whole form thereof. All the
[1:24:59] ordinances thereof and do them.
[1:25:01] &gt;&gt; See, God will only dwell in a temple
[1:25:03] patterned after what he had in his mind.
[1:25:05] He said, "If you'll come back to me and
[1:25:07] let me show you the pattern, if you'll
[1:25:08] do it,
[1:25:09] &gt;&gt; I'll dwell in it."
[1:25:12] &gt;&gt; Now listen, Paul tells us this. See, he
[1:25:14] has a pattern for us as an individual.
[1:25:16] In 1 Corinthians 6:18, he said, "Flee
[1:25:17] fornication."
[1:25:19] Now, why is this why is that's sexual
[1:25:22] sin outside of sexual things outside of
[1:25:25] marriage? Excuse me for being plain, but
[1:25:28] it's an age when we kind of have to be.
[1:25:31] &gt;&gt; But every sin that a man doeth is
[1:25:33] without the body. But he that committh
[1:25:35] fornication sinnth against his own body.
[1:25:38] &gt;&gt; What? Know ye not that your body is the
[1:25:40] temple of the Holy Ghost, which is in
[1:25:42] you? Would you have of God? You are not
[1:25:46] your own?
[1:25:49] So he gives us a reason. He doesn't just
[1:25:51] say don't do that.
[1:25:53] &gt;&gt; He says this is why
[1:25:56] &gt;&gt; don't commit fornication because that's
[1:25:58] a sin against the body.
[1:26:00] &gt;&gt; You are bought with a price.
[1:26:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:03] &gt;&gt; Therefore glorify God in your body
[1:26:06] &gt;&gt; and in your spirit which are gods. See
[1:26:09] we cannot be the temple of God living in
[1:26:12] sin. And we cannot be his temple by
[1:26:14] dogma or by creed, by works
[1:26:18] &gt;&gt; or by opinions.
[1:26:19] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:26:21] &gt;&gt; Right. See, my opinions are not worthy.
[1:26:26] &gt;&gt; David could have said, "Well, I'm going
[1:26:27] to I think this is pretty good, Lord,
[1:26:28] but I'm going to add this little corner,
[1:26:31] &gt;&gt; add a little closet,
[1:26:33] &gt;&gt; right? And we I'll just bring the
[1:26:34] materials myself, and they'll be fine."
[1:26:36] But see, David's opinion
[1:26:38] &gt;&gt; wasn't good enough
[1:26:40] &gt;&gt; to be included in the pattern. Come on.
[1:26:42] &gt;&gt; Solomon's opinion wasn't sufficient.
[1:26:46] &gt;&gt; Come on, church. My opinion is not
[1:26:48] sufficient
[1:26:49] &gt;&gt; to be included. Your opinion is not
[1:26:51] sufficient to be included in the tab, in
[1:26:53] the pattern. It must be the word of God.
[1:26:55] Yes.
[1:26:58] &gt;&gt; Listen, Colossians 2:16 tells us, he
[1:27:01] said, "Let no man therefore judge you in
[1:27:03] meat or in drink
[1:27:06] &gt;&gt; or in respect of a holy day or of the
[1:27:08] new moon or of the Sabbath days." In
[1:27:11] other words, if somebody comes along and
[1:27:12] says, "You need to be keeping Saturday
[1:27:14] as the Sabbath, you need to be eat, you
[1:27:17] know, not eating pork."
[1:27:20] &gt;&gt; Paul says, "Don't listen to that."
[1:27:23] &gt;&gt; Right? Unless you just want to not eat
[1:27:25] pork for reasons of health. Like that's
[1:27:27] fine.
[1:27:30] &gt;&gt; But I'd rather enjoy my life.
[1:27:36] &gt;&gt; But look, he said, "Don't let any man
[1:27:38] judge you or the new moon or the Sabbath
[1:27:40] days." Because they had all kinds of
[1:27:41] feasts and festivals and you know if
[1:27:43] they saw somebody step outside their
[1:27:45] house on a certain day like got him.
[1:27:49] &gt;&gt; Paul said don't let people do that to
[1:27:51] you.
[1:27:52] &gt;&gt; Right. So, what's he saying now? There
[1:27:55] are things we've been left to do, but
[1:27:57] leave it at that.
[1:27:58] &gt;&gt; He told us to honor the resurrection,
[1:28:00] &gt;&gt; go to church,
[1:28:02] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:28:04] &gt;&gt; Every time we possibly can, he said,
[1:28:05] "Every time the doors are open, every
[1:28:06] time we possibly can,
[1:28:08] &gt;&gt; right? Go to church." But that's not
[1:28:11] what makes us a Christian,
[1:28:12] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:28:12] &gt;&gt; He said, "Don't let any man begal you of
[1:28:15] your reward."
[1:28:16] &gt;&gt; Come on. Other words, don't in the in in
[1:28:20] our modern language, let no man defraud
[1:28:22] you of your prize
[1:28:25] &gt;&gt; by telling you to fast on certain days,
[1:28:27] voluntary humility, worshiping of
[1:28:30] angels,
[1:28:31] &gt;&gt; worshiping an intermediary instead of
[1:28:33] Christ,
[1:28:35] &gt;&gt; intruding into those things which he
[1:28:37] hath not seen. In other words, a man
[1:28:39] who's not a prophet,
[1:28:40] &gt;&gt; come on,
[1:28:41] &gt;&gt; comes and tells you, "This is what you
[1:28:43] have to do on a certain day."
[1:28:44] &gt;&gt; Come on, preach. And you know what I'm
[1:28:46] talking about this morning,
[1:28:48] &gt;&gt; brother. The Bible says don't do it.
[1:28:52] &gt;&gt; Don't let him steal you of your prize.
[1:28:54] See, we're supposed to do what we do as
[1:28:55] a voluntary service.
[1:28:57] &gt;&gt; It's not a forced worship. It's not,
[1:28:59] well, everybody's going to have church
[1:29:00] at the same time and everybody's going
[1:29:02] to do this at the same time. That is not
[1:29:03] what God called us to do.
[1:29:05] &gt;&gt; But he's called us to be to to
[1:29:08] voluntarily want to get together to to
[1:29:10] have a have a heart full of praise and
[1:29:12] worship God out of the depths of our
[1:29:14] heart. Right.
[1:29:16] &gt;&gt; Let no man defraud you of your prize. Am
[1:29:18] I telling you to f fast on certain days
[1:29:20] or worship certain people?
[1:29:21] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:29:22] &gt;&gt; See, the false teacher makes his own
[1:29:24] walls, builds his own temple.
[1:29:26] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:29:26] &gt;&gt; God said, "I won't have no part in it."
[1:29:28] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:29:29] &gt;&gt; Just cuz somebody told you that somebody
[1:29:31] told them that somebody told them that
[1:29:33] Brother Brandham said something.
[1:29:34] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:29:35] &gt;&gt; Make sure it's in the pattern.
[1:29:37] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:29:38] &gt;&gt; Before you start doing it
[1:29:40] &gt;&gt; or forcing other people to do it.
[1:29:43] &gt;&gt; Are you with me now?
[1:29:45] He said, "Don't defraud yourself of your
[1:29:47] prize."
[1:29:50] &gt;&gt; He said, "Not holding the head." There's
[1:29:52] the problem. They're not connected to
[1:29:53] the word. Not holding the head from
[1:29:56] which all the body by joints and bands
[1:29:58] having nourishment ministered and knit
[1:30:00] together increases with the increase of
[1:30:03] God. Their headship is not Christ. He
[1:30:06] said, "Wherefore, if you be dead with
[1:30:07] Christ from the rudiments of the world,
[1:30:09] why as though living in the world are
[1:30:11] you subject to ordinances? Touch not,
[1:30:13] taste not, handle not, which are all all
[1:30:16] are to perish with the using after the
[1:30:18] commandments and doctrines of men. But
[1:30:20] things have indeed a show of wisdom in
[1:30:22] will worship. Will worship. Mark that in
[1:30:25] your minds. Humility, neglecting of the
[1:30:27] body, not in any honor to the satisfying
[1:30:30] of the flesh. So other words, acting
[1:30:31] humble, fasting, and letting everybody
[1:30:34] see you fast and going around with a
[1:30:36] long face all the time. How spiritual
[1:30:38] that you are. He said, don't do that,
[1:30:40] but let it be something from the heart.
[1:30:44] And will worship he said what is here
[1:30:45] term will worship signifies this is a
[1:30:48] commentary but I thought it was good. It
[1:30:50] signifies simply a mode of worship which
[1:30:51] a man chooses for himself independently
[1:30:54] of the revelation which God has given.
[1:30:57] So will worship is independent of
[1:30:59] revelation. Worship by desire instead of
[1:31:02] revelation. Like Cain worshiped by
[1:31:04] desire. Abel worship by revelation. I'm
[1:31:07] hurrying to finish so we can get done
[1:31:08] today in time. He said we must worship
[1:31:11] God. See, in Christ, the pattern that
[1:31:14] God said, even for Abel was blood. How
[1:31:16] many know that today?
[1:31:17] &gt;&gt; You ain't getting by any other way. You
[1:31:19] young people, it's going to take a
[1:31:20] birth. That God's got to come down and
[1:31:22] live in you. It's got to be a washing
[1:31:24] away of your sins. You can't just come
[1:31:26] in and be a part of the church. You got
[1:31:28] to be born again.
[1:31:29] &gt;&gt; That's the pattern that God said. The
[1:31:31] pattern was blood. The pattern always
[1:31:33] will be blood.
[1:31:34] &gt;&gt; No substitute will work. Right?
[1:31:37] &gt;&gt; Remember when Jesus stood there with
[1:31:40] Peter and John and they stood there on
[1:31:42] the Peter and James and John and they
[1:31:44] stood there on the on the mountain. He
[1:31:46] was transfigured in front of them
[1:31:48] &gt;&gt; and and they see Moses and Elijah come
[1:31:50] down. Remember and Peter said, "Let's
[1:31:52] build a a temple."
[1:31:54] &gt;&gt; In fact, let's build three temples.
[1:31:58] &gt;&gt; That was Peter's opinion.
[1:32:01] &gt;&gt; But look at God's opinion,
[1:32:03] &gt;&gt; right? Anybody can have their opinion of
[1:32:04] how we ought to worship. What was God's
[1:32:07] opinion? While he yet spoke, behold, a
[1:32:09] bright cloud overshadowed them, and a
[1:32:11] voice out of the cloud was said, "This
[1:32:12] is my beloved son in whom I'm well
[1:32:14] pleased. Hear ye him." He speaks the
[1:32:17] same thing today. When men set up their
[1:32:19] denominations in their tabernacles, God
[1:32:21] said, "This is my house. This is what I
[1:32:23] want. I want the the depths of your
[1:32:25] heart. I don't want to worship out of
[1:32:27] force. I don't want to worship out of
[1:32:28] some idea somebody had or some opinion.
[1:32:31] I want to worship that comes from the
[1:32:33] heart." Right.
[1:32:34] &gt;&gt; Good.
[1:32:35] &gt;&gt; How many want to build God a house?
[1:32:38] &gt;&gt; And you realize you are the house of
[1:32:39] God. You said, "Lord, let me let me let
[1:32:42] you build your house within me. Let let
[1:32:44] me let you take over my life. Take over
[1:32:47] the works of my life."
[1:32:51] He's not satisfied until we follow the
[1:32:54] pattern. And when we follow the pattern
[1:32:56] of Acts 2:38, repent and be baptized
[1:32:58] every one of you in the name of Jesus
[1:33:00] Christ for the remission of sins. You
[1:33:01] shall receive the gift of the Holy
[1:33:02] Ghost. That's when he comes down to
[1:33:03] dwell in his temple. I want to just take
[1:33:07] a few minutes.
[1:33:10] We have become his temple by the Holy
[1:33:11] Ghost. Do you believe that
[1:33:14] &gt;&gt; you're the temple of God? Paul says,
[1:33:16] "Know you not that you're the temple of
[1:33:17] the Holy Ghost?"
[1:33:19] How should we worship in that temple?
[1:33:22] How should we worship?
[1:33:24] The Bible says, "God is a spirit. They
[1:33:27] that worship him must worship him in
[1:33:29] spirit and in truth."
[1:33:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. by inspiration and by letter.
[1:33:35] &gt;&gt; Right? Now look, what was the pattern?
[1:33:39] Now look, whenever the people came to
[1:33:41] the temple of God, they were not just to
[1:33:43] come any old way
[1:33:45] &gt;&gt; to the house of God. Do you know how
[1:33:48] they came? Some of y'all are going to
[1:33:50] look sideways at me. I can see it
[1:33:52] already. Preparing myself for it.
[1:33:57] &gt;&gt; You know how they came? Singing and
[1:33:59] shouting.
[1:34:00] &gt;&gt; Do you know that? That's right.
[1:34:03] &gt;&gt; They come to the house of God,
[1:34:04] &gt;&gt; sir.
[1:34:05] &gt;&gt; Singing and shouting,
[1:34:07] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:34:08] &gt;&gt; And God says, "I want that kind of
[1:34:09] worship,
[1:34:11] &gt;&gt; but I want it to be voluntary."
[1:34:13] &gt;&gt; There you go.
[1:34:15] &gt;&gt; Are you with me now?
[1:34:16] &gt;&gt; But it's singing and shouting.
[1:34:18] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:34:19] &gt;&gt; That's how we ought to come.
[1:34:21] &gt;&gt; That's what he told us. Now, when Ezra
[1:34:23] began to rebuild the temple, the people
[1:34:25] saw just the foundation of it. Remember,
[1:34:27] Ezekiel saw the pattern. What did they
[1:34:29] do? They went back and built a temple
[1:34:33] according to the pattern. And in Ezra
[1:34:36] chapter 3 and 10, it says, "When the
[1:34:38] builders laid the foundation of the
[1:34:40] temple of the Lord, they set the priests
[1:34:42] in their apparel with trumpets." So they
[1:34:44] said, "Okay, we got a foundation now.
[1:34:47] Let's have church."
[1:34:49] I like that. I know. You know, we've
[1:34:51] always we're always looking at at doing
[1:34:52] things and and helping out, make sure we
[1:34:54] have enough room and things for our
[1:34:56] congregation coming on and all our
[1:34:58] children and things. We're always
[1:34:59] looking to the future.
[1:35:00] &gt;&gt; But listen to what they said. They said,
[1:35:02] "We got a foundation now. Let's have
[1:35:03] church."
[1:35:04] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:35:06] &gt;&gt; I think we're there this morning,
[1:35:07] church.
[1:35:08] &gt;&gt; We got a good foundation. Let's have
[1:35:10] church.
[1:35:10] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:35:11] &gt;&gt; So, they come to the house of God and
[1:35:13] they saw the foundation. The builders
[1:35:15] laid the foundation of the temple of the
[1:35:17] Lord. And they sent the priests with the
[1:35:18] trumpets and the Levites, the sons of
[1:35:20] Asaf, with symbols. The sons of Asaf
[1:35:22] were drum players.
[1:35:26] &gt;&gt; You'd argue with the scriptures. Right.
[1:35:29] &gt;&gt; They they
[1:35:31] if I had regular symbols back here, I'd
[1:35:33] go, "Oh, they do make noise.
[1:35:37] &gt;&gt; But the sons of ASAP were drum
[1:35:39] drummers."
[1:35:40] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[1:35:41] &gt;&gt; Right. But that they were doing it for
[1:35:42] the Lord.
[1:35:43] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:35:44] &gt;&gt; Right. And they come in with the symbols
[1:35:46] to praise the Lord after the ordinance
[1:35:48] of David,
[1:35:50] &gt;&gt; king of Israel.
[1:35:51] &gt;&gt; So they said, "David didn't just show us
[1:35:53] how to build the house.
[1:35:55] &gt;&gt; He didn't just tell us." Hallelujah. How
[1:35:58] to set it up. But in every time the
[1:36:01] temple was set up, he also orchestrated
[1:36:03] the worship in the temple to be in a
[1:36:06] certain way. And the Bible says that
[1:36:08] they sang together by course. So it's
[1:36:11] okay to sing in the house of God
[1:36:13] &gt;&gt; and do it harmoniously and by course.
[1:36:16] Other words, to have order to it,
[1:36:19] &gt;&gt; and giving thanks unto the Lord because
[1:36:21] he's good. for his mercy endureth
[1:36:23] forever towards Israel and all the
[1:36:25] people
[1:36:28] &gt;&gt; shouted with a great shout
[1:36:30] &gt;&gt; when they praised the Lord because the
[1:36:32] foundation of the house of the Lord was
[1:36:35] laid
[1:36:35] &gt;&gt; right
[1:36:36] &gt;&gt; you say well if I see God lay a
[1:36:38] foundation I'll shout just hang on a
[1:36:40] minute
[1:36:41] but many of the priests and Levites and
[1:36:43] chief of the fathers who were ancient
[1:36:45] men
[1:36:45] &gt;&gt; that had seen the first house
[1:36:47] &gt;&gt; when the foundation of this house was
[1:36:49] laid before their eyes
[1:36:51] &gt;&gt; wept with a loud voice and many shouted
[1:36:54] aloud for joy sir
[1:36:55] &gt;&gt; so that the people could not discern the
[1:36:57] noise of the shout of joy and the noise
[1:36:59] of the weeping of the people for the
[1:37:01] people shouted with a loud shout the
[1:37:02] noise was heard a far off listen those
[1:37:05] those men wept they wept because they
[1:37:06] remember the glory of the former temple
[1:37:08] but they also wept because they saw the
[1:37:10] new temple coming out in their mind's
[1:37:12] eye they could it was just a foundation
[1:37:14] but they could see the beginnings of it
[1:37:15] they could see it start to build
[1:37:19] &gt;&gt; so they sang and they shouted and they
[1:37:22] wept.
[1:37:25] They sang and shout because that was the
[1:37:27] pattern.
[1:37:28] &gt;&gt; Listen to Psalms 100. Make a joyful
[1:37:30] noise of the Lord all you land. Serve
[1:37:31] the Lord with gladness. Come before his
[1:37:33] presence with
[1:37:37] &gt;&gt; you see. We You thought we just had a
[1:37:38] song service just out of a form
[1:37:41] &gt;&gt; and it didn't matter if we actually
[1:37:42] worshiped or not.
[1:37:44] &gt;&gt; But the pattern was
[1:37:46] &gt;&gt; to come to the house of God
[1:37:48] &gt;&gt; and sing. say, "Well, I'm not a good
[1:37:50] singer." Brother Ryan, sing anyway.
[1:37:54] Right, Brother Ryan may be a good
[1:37:56] singer, buddy. I don't know. But if
[1:37:58] you're not a good singer, sing anyway.
[1:38:01] &gt;&gt; In congregational worship, you may never
[1:38:03] sing a special,
[1:38:04] &gt;&gt; but sing.
[1:38:08] &gt;&gt; Why? Because you're coming into his
[1:38:09] presence.
[1:38:11] &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? I know there's some
[1:38:13] people that come to church to be
[1:38:14] entertained. I never like to just be
[1:38:16] entertained.
[1:38:17] &gt;&gt; I wanted to be part of it.
[1:38:19] I want to lift my hands in the house of
[1:38:21] God. I want to enjoy the presence of
[1:38:23] God.
[1:38:23] &gt;&gt; God, help us to, you know, that should
[1:38:25] be a part of us. I know some people are
[1:38:27] shy and some people are different. Some
[1:38:28] people are quiet and that's fine. God
[1:38:30] has all kinds of oddly cut stones. We'll
[1:38:33] get into that maybe at a later date that
[1:38:34] he built the temple with. All kinds of
[1:38:36] people that are different in their ways
[1:38:38] and things, but yet we can do something.
[1:38:40] We can lift our voice during the song
[1:38:42] service. We can clap our hands. We can
[1:38:44] raise our hands. We can do something. We
[1:38:45] can sing and we can shout because we're
[1:38:47] coming before his presence.
[1:38:51] &gt;&gt; Know ye that the Lord, he is God. It is
[1:38:53] he that has made us not. We ourselves.
[1:38:54] We are his people and the sheep of his
[1:38:56] pasture. Enter into his gates with
[1:38:59] thanksgiving.
[1:39:01] Into his courts with praise. Be thankful
[1:39:04] unto him and bless his name. What does
[1:39:05] it mean in the scripture to bless his
[1:39:07] name? In Proverbs, I'm getting so
[1:39:09] sidetracked this morning. In Proverbs,
[1:39:10] it says that if you go to your
[1:39:12] neighbor's house and bless him loudly,
[1:39:14] &gt;&gt; he'll get offended with you. That's the
[1:39:17] Benuit translation of it. Did you know
[1:39:20] the Bible says that
[1:39:22] &gt;&gt; and you say, "Well, I bless the Lord,
[1:39:23] but I do it quietly." Well, your
[1:39:25] neighbor wouldn't be offended if
[1:39:26] blessing was quiet.
[1:39:29] &gt;&gt; But if you go to your neighbor's house
[1:39:30] and bless him
[1:39:33] in the morning, said he'll get upset.
[1:39:35] But if you go to God's house and bless
[1:39:38] his name, what does that mean? Lift up
[1:39:39] your voice.
[1:39:40] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:39:40] &gt;&gt; That's right. Yes, sir.
[1:39:43] &gt;&gt; This pattern was in the first temple and
[1:39:45] the second temple. It was in the alpha
[1:39:46] bride, the omega bride.
[1:39:48] &gt;&gt; See, Paul says, "Wherefore, be not
[1:39:50] unwise, but understanding what the will
[1:39:52] of the Lord is."
[1:39:53] &gt;&gt; Don't just worship by your own will, but
[1:39:55] by the will of the Lord. Be not drunk
[1:39:57] with wine, wherein is excess, but be
[1:39:59] filled with the spirit, speaking to
[1:40:00] yourselves in psalms and hymns and
[1:40:03] spiritual songs, singing and making
[1:40:04] melody in your heart to the Lord. I know
[1:40:06] a lot of people read that verse and say,
[1:40:07] "Well, praise God. I can sing and make
[1:40:09] melody in my heart. That's true.
[1:40:12] &gt;&gt; We ought to do that all the time.
[1:40:14] &gt;&gt; But look at the next verse.
[1:40:16] Giving thanks always
[1:40:19] &gt;&gt; for all things unto God and the father
[1:40:21] in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:40:23] Submitting yourselves one to another in
[1:40:26] the fear of God. So it's not just when
[1:40:28] you're by yourself, but when you're in
[1:40:29] the congregation, worship the Lord.
[1:40:33] &gt;&gt; And that that that melody in your heart
[1:40:35] might bless you, but it didn't bless me
[1:40:37] any.
[1:40:37] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:40:39] Right? That's like speaking in tongues
[1:40:40] at home. That's good. You realize
[1:40:42] there's a heavenly language. Am I going
[1:40:43] to get myself in trouble call you might
[1:40:45] call me a Pentecostal,
[1:40:46] &gt;&gt; but the Bible says there's a heavenly
[1:40:48] language. Brother Brandham taught us
[1:40:49] that,
[1:40:50] &gt;&gt; right? You can speak in tongues in your
[1:40:51] prayer closet,
[1:40:52] &gt;&gt; but that don't help the church a bit,
[1:40:55] &gt;&gt; right? And if you come do it in the
[1:40:56] church, just interrupt the service. That
[1:40:57] don't help the church a bit.
[1:40:59] &gt;&gt; You were blessed.
[1:41:00] &gt;&gt; Very good.
[1:41:01] &gt;&gt; Right. But the church wasn't blessed by
[1:41:02] it.
[1:41:04] &gt;&gt; Oh my. But if prophecy could be given,
[1:41:07] it'd be a blessing because the church
[1:41:08] could understand it. Right?
[1:41:10] &gt;&gt; If you just pray in your heart, it don't
[1:41:11] help nobody else.
[1:41:13] &gt;&gt; If you just worship in your heart, that
[1:41:15] don't help the person beside you. And
[1:41:16] it's not wrong to do that, right? I'm
[1:41:18] not criticizing you this morning. That's
[1:41:20] part of it. But you need to understand
[1:41:21] that's not all of it. There needs to be
[1:41:23] something on the outside expressing what
[1:41:25] you feel on the inside. And if you don't
[1:41:27] feel that way about him, I think we need
[1:41:29] to get closer to him. Find out who he
[1:41:31] really is. Begin to read the word of God
[1:41:33] and study who he is. and you'll begin to
[1:41:35] worship him because you'll recognize I
[1:41:37] was a sinner. I needed help and he
[1:41:39] brought me out of the out of the deep
[1:41:40] miry clay. He lifted my feet up on a
[1:41:42] solid rock to stay.
[1:41:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:47] This was the pattern. Listen. And this
[1:41:49] pattern did not start,
[1:41:52] remember the temple pattern started?
[1:41:54] This did not start with Paul. This did
[1:41:56] not start with David. This did not start
[1:41:58] with Solomon. It didn't start with
[1:42:00] Moses.
[1:42:02] But Moses saw God's temple in heaven,
[1:42:06] &gt;&gt; right? He saw the pattern of heaven.
[1:42:09] &gt;&gt; And when he saw it, what did he do? He
[1:42:11] patterned the tabernacle after it. And
[1:42:13] in that tabernacle, there were
[1:42:14] worshippers,
[1:42:16] &gt;&gt; constant worship,
[1:42:18] &gt;&gt; because we know that when Isaiah saw the
[1:42:20] he the the temple in heaven,
[1:42:22] &gt;&gt; right? He was in the temple and he and
[1:42:24] and heavens opened up. And here he sees
[1:42:26] God sitting on his throne high and
[1:42:28] lifted up, what did he hear? What did he
[1:42:29] see? And what did he hear? He saw the
[1:42:31] cherubim worshiping constantly until the
[1:42:33] posts were moved at the noise of the
[1:42:36] cherubam saying, "Holy, holy, holy is
[1:42:38] the Lord God Almighty."
[1:42:42] &gt;&gt; And so the pattern was for there to be
[1:42:43] worship in the presence of God.
[1:42:47] &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, he didn't mean for us to
[1:42:49] do that." But do you believe, how many
[1:42:52] believe you were in the mind of God
[1:42:54] &gt;&gt; before the foundation of the world?
[1:42:57] &gt;&gt; So that pattern was in the mind of God,
[1:42:59] right?
[1:43:00] So Job is grumbling and complaining. He
[1:43:02] had a lot to complain about.
[1:43:05] &gt;&gt; He did.
[1:43:07] &gt;&gt; He had a lot to complain about. I know
[1:43:09] some of us do.
[1:43:10] &gt;&gt; I don't want to be insensitive to that.
[1:43:13] &gt;&gt; Some people go through things. That's
[1:43:14] part of life.
[1:43:16] &gt;&gt; And we don't want to dismiss that.
[1:43:17] People, there's times when you're so low
[1:43:19] you can't worship the way you want to.
[1:43:22] &gt;&gt; But you you can't stay there.
[1:43:24] &gt;&gt; Start digging yourself out of that hole.
[1:43:29] Hallelujah.
[1:43:31] Like the old story of the of the mule
[1:43:33] that fell down the pit and the farmer
[1:43:35] said, "Well, he fell down there. I don't
[1:43:36] it's not worth getting out, so I'll just
[1:43:38] throw dirt on top of him." So, he just
[1:43:40] kept throwing dirt and every time he
[1:43:41] threw dirt, the old mule just walked
[1:43:42] around and stopped stamped on it.
[1:43:44] &gt;&gt; Pretty soon, he just walked right out of
[1:43:46] the pit.
[1:43:49] &gt;&gt; So, I just said, "If the devil's
[1:43:50] throwing dirt at me, let him just keep
[1:43:51] throwing it. Pretty soon, I'm just going
[1:43:53] to walk out of the pit." He made it for
[1:43:54] me.
[1:43:55] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:43:56] I'm going to worship God again in the
[1:43:58] house of God. Oh, church, come on. You
[1:44:00] know what it's like to be through a
[1:44:02] trial and to go through some things
[1:44:03] maybe for months and years of your life
[1:44:05] and you're in a dry season and then one
[1:44:07] day it breaks on you and something
[1:44:09] happens in your life and you raise your
[1:44:11] hands again. You say, "Lord, now I know
[1:44:13] you're with me. I can worship you in
[1:44:15] your house again. Oh, and it's worth
[1:44:17] every moment. It's worth the hard
[1:44:18] times." Job was going through that kind
[1:44:20] of a time,
[1:44:21] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:44:22] &gt;&gt; A very difficult time. And God finally
[1:44:24] talked to him. And he said, "Job, you've
[1:44:25] said a lot of things."
[1:44:26] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:44:27] &gt;&gt; I want you to listen for a little bit.
[1:44:29] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[1:44:32] &gt;&gt; And he asked him in Job 38:4, he said,
[1:44:34] "Where were you?"
[1:44:36] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:44:38] When I laid the foundation,
[1:44:44] &gt;&gt; remember what they did when they saw the
[1:44:46] foundation of the house of God
[1:44:49] &gt;&gt; and it was laying there and they begin
[1:44:50] to worship
[1:44:54] &gt;&gt; and Job said, God said, "Job, where were
[1:44:56] you when I laid the foundations of the
[1:44:58] earth?"
[1:45:02] &gt;&gt; The earth is an attribute of God
[1:45:04] &gt;&gt; was in his mind. That's why it won't be
[1:45:06] completely annihilated. It's just
[1:45:08] renovated,
[1:45:10] &gt;&gt; right? In the new heavens and the new
[1:45:11] earth.
[1:45:13] But look, where were you when I laid the
[1:45:15] foundation of the earth?
[1:45:17] &gt;&gt; There's a y'all missed that. There's a
[1:45:19] great revelation in that.
[1:45:21] &gt;&gt; You can't be annihilated.
[1:45:25] &gt;&gt; Cuz you were in his mind before the
[1:45:27] foundation of the earth. So, you got to
[1:45:29] be renovated.
[1:45:36] This was the pattern. Look, he said,
[1:45:38] "Where were you, Job?" Declare if you
[1:45:40] have understanding. Whoath laid the
[1:45:42] measures thereof?
[1:45:44] Remember, he told Moses, "This is the
[1:45:45] weight. This is how many inches, how
[1:45:48] many feet, how many cubits to make the
[1:45:50] temple?" And God tells Job, he said, "In
[1:45:53] the beginning, when I made the earth,
[1:45:56] where were you? When the foundations
[1:45:59] fastened, who laid the cornerstone
[1:46:01] thereof? When the morning stars
[1:46:05] &gt;&gt; sang together,
[1:46:07] &gt;&gt; sang.
[1:46:09] &gt;&gt; And all someone say all.
[1:46:12] &gt;&gt; The sons of God shouted.
[1:46:17] &gt;&gt; Good.
[1:46:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:46:20] &gt;&gt; For joy.
[1:46:21] &gt;&gt; You say, "Brother Ben, I've never
[1:46:22] shouted in church." Oh, yes, you have.
[1:46:26] That's right.
[1:46:28] &gt;&gt; You don't remember it cuz you bypassed
[1:46:30] your theophony to come
[1:46:33] &gt;&gt; come down here and be tempted.
[1:46:34] &gt;&gt; But just like they stood there when when
[1:46:36] Ezra laid the foundation of the temple
[1:46:38] and they stood there and begin to sing
[1:46:39] and shout you
[1:46:41] &gt;&gt; in the mind of God.
[1:46:43] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:46:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:46:45] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:46:45] &gt;&gt; He saw you praising
[1:46:48] &gt;&gt; worshiping
[1:46:49] &gt;&gt; shouting.
[1:46:50] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:46:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:46:54] when he laid the foundations of the
[1:46:56] earth.
[1:46:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:58] &gt;&gt; You worship God.
[1:47:02] &gt;&gt; Now listen to me for just a moment. This
[1:47:03] this message, you remember the model had
[1:47:05] to be there, but now the model began to
[1:47:08] be lost over the church ages.
[1:47:10] &gt;&gt; We still had the writing, but not the
[1:47:11] model.
[1:47:13] And God sent a prophet in our age.
[1:47:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:16] &gt;&gt; To do something. Brother Brandham
[1:47:18] whenever they would talk to him about
[1:47:19] that about the sons of God or they talk
[1:47:22] to him about people shouting in church
[1:47:24] he'd say they said what are you part of
[1:47:26] this new religion this new shouting
[1:47:28] religion
[1:47:29] &gt;&gt; and he'd say no he said I don't have a
[1:47:31] case of new religion he said I've got a
[1:47:33] case a new case of old religion
[1:47:36] &gt;&gt; oldtime religion
[1:47:38] &gt;&gt; because I when the morning star sang
[1:47:40] together and the sons of God shouted for
[1:47:41] joy he said I was there
[1:47:42] &gt;&gt; come on
[1:47:44] &gt;&gt; right and you were there in the mind of
[1:47:45] God
[1:47:46] &gt;&gt; but Zechariah Zechariah 4 and:9
[1:47:49] &gt;&gt; right
[1:47:50] &gt;&gt; the Bible says now Zerubbabel was a man
[1:47:53] who was the who was the governor during
[1:47:56] that time during the time of Ezra and
[1:47:58] Nehemiah Zerubabel was somebody who God
[1:48:01] had anointed
[1:48:02] &gt;&gt; right to lay the foundation and to
[1:48:04] finish
[1:48:06] &gt;&gt; the temple of God
[1:48:07] &gt;&gt; and so in Zechariah 4:9 it says the
[1:48:10] hands of Zerubabel have laid the
[1:48:12] foundation of this house
[1:48:14] &gt;&gt; his hands shall also will finish it.
[1:48:18] &gt;&gt; Now, Zachariah is encouraging him. He
[1:48:20] said, "Thou shalt know that the Lord of
[1:48:21] hosts has sent me unto you." He's
[1:48:23] encouraging him. He said, "He laid the
[1:48:24] foundation. He's also going to finish
[1:48:26] it."
[1:48:27] &gt;&gt; And brother Brandon said, "We know the
[1:48:28] scripture said that Jesus is the chief
[1:48:30] cornerstone and he's also the
[1:48:32] headstone."
[1:48:33] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:48:34] &gt;&gt; He said, "Now, if we will think for a
[1:48:36] few minutes that the seventh church age
[1:48:38] messenger was to restore the faith of
[1:48:40] the children back to the fathers.
[1:48:43] &gt;&gt; In other words, rebuild the church
[1:48:45] again."
[1:48:45] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:48:47] Glory to God. Under the power of the
[1:48:50] spirit. Not by power, not by might, but
[1:48:52] by my spirit, sayeth the Lord. Not by
[1:48:54] organization, not by denomination, but
[1:48:56] by the Holy Spirit, God will bring forth
[1:48:59] the church in the last days. What was he
[1:49:02] doing? He said, "The hands that laid it,
[1:49:04] the very message that he sent us, that
[1:49:05] laid the foundation will finish the
[1:49:07] building. We're going home one of these
[1:49:09] days." Listen, when you see a foundation
[1:49:11] laid, that's the time for the sons of
[1:49:13] God to shout together for joy, that's
[1:49:16] the time for the morning stars to sing
[1:49:18] together. When you see, oh church, when
[1:49:19] you see the message of the hour that
[1:49:21] it's complete and laying out there in
[1:49:23] front of us,
[1:49:24] &gt;&gt; hallelujah, it's going to carry us home.
[1:49:26] Listen, musicians, go ahead and come.
[1:49:27] Paul said in Philippians 1:6, "Being
[1:49:29] confident," how many you're confident
[1:49:31] this morning, being confident of this
[1:49:33] very thing that he which hath begun a
[1:49:35] good work in you, if you saw him lay a
[1:49:38] foundation in your life, if it was his
[1:49:39] hands that put it in your life, if you
[1:49:41] saw him lay a foundation, he's also
[1:49:43] going to finish the work. You can shout
[1:49:45] for for joy, even though the work's not
[1:49:47] complete yet, but you can say, "Lord, I
[1:49:49] know you're building a temple in my
[1:49:51] life. You're building a place for you to
[1:49:53] dwell, and I'm happy this morning that
[1:49:55] you chose to dwell with me." Amen.
[1:49:57] &gt;&gt; I believe I'm in your presence.
[1:50:01] Hallelujah.
[1:50:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He who has begun a good work
[1:50:06] in you will
[1:50:09] will
[1:50:10] [Music]
[1:50:12] he will.
[1:50:15] Brother Trip, he will perform it.
[1:50:19] He started a good work. He will.
[1:50:22] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me this morning? Every
[1:50:23] one of you. But Mike, he will perform it
[1:50:25] if he
[1:50:27] &gt;&gt; he will perform it. Are you hearing me
[1:50:29] this morning? He will. If he laid the
[1:50:31] foundation, if you're the elect of God,
[1:50:33] he will.
[1:50:33] &gt;&gt; Come on. Lord,
[1:50:35] &gt;&gt; you're his temple. He began to build you
[1:50:37] by the message of the hour. He will.
[1:50:41] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Yes, sir.
[1:50:43] &gt;&gt; He will finish it. He will bring forth
[1:50:46] the church in the last days.
[1:50:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:50:52] I'm so thankful. Excuse me for taking a
[1:50:54] little extra time, but it's just so much
[1:50:56] on my heart this morning. He will. I
[1:51:00] believe we could shout over that.
[1:51:02] &gt;&gt; We could rejoice in the presence of God.
[1:51:04] We can lift our voice. We may not be the
[1:51:06] loudest, but let ours be a willing
[1:51:08] heart. Oh God, let me worship the way
[1:51:11] you want me to worship. Let me worship
[1:51:13] with all that I have.
[1:51:16] Hallelujah.
[1:51:17] When we have seen this message lay the
[1:51:19] foundation of restoration,
[1:51:22] we know it will also bring forth the
[1:51:24] headstone crying grace.
[1:51:28] &gt;&gt; Oh, Zerubable said I can't do it. The
[1:51:30] builders of the temple said there's no
[1:51:31] way. There's too much opposition, too
[1:51:33] many people coming against us. But he
[1:51:35] said grace.
[1:51:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Grace unto the headstone.
[1:51:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:51:45] We can sing and shout like they did at
[1:51:46] the foundation of the world. The grace
[1:51:49] of God. Would you bow your heads with me
[1:51:51] this morning?
[1:51:53] Hallelujah.
[1:51:58] Hallelujah.
[1:51:59] He will.
[1:52:03] I just felt an urgy in my heart to tell
[1:52:06] you that this morning. He will perform
[1:52:08] it.
[1:52:10] &gt;&gt; Don't give up now.
[1:52:12] Don't give in now. He will perform.
[1:52:17] He will finish what he started. He's
[1:52:19] never built the house without counting
[1:52:21] the cost
[1:52:23] knowing that he had the material.
[1:52:28] If he called you to the message of the
[1:52:29] hour, if he's given you the baptism of
[1:52:31] the Holy Ghost, if he's filled you with
[1:52:32] his spirit, even if you're just now,
[1:52:34] maybe you're at the beginning of that
[1:52:35] journey and you're just you just felt
[1:52:37] called by God whom he has called.
[1:52:42] He calls who he chooses. He chooses who
[1:52:45] he chooses. He will glorify. We're going
[1:52:47] to get into that in Ephesians. He
[1:52:49] predestinated you. He called you.
[1:52:50] There's a reason why you feel that tug.
[1:52:52] Just surrender to it this morning.
[1:52:54] &gt;&gt; If he's begun a good work, if you've
[1:52:56] seen his hands lay the foundation, you
[1:52:59] young people, when you see the hands of
[1:53:01] the Lord lay a foundation in your life,
[1:53:03] know that he will finish the work. Yes,
[1:53:06] sir.
[1:53:07] &gt;&gt; And it's going to be okay.
[1:53:10] I pray that it would be Let's bow our
[1:53:12] heads. Heavenly Father,
[1:53:15] Lord Jesus, wherever we are in our
[1:53:17] Christian journey, as I look across the
[1:53:19] audience, I know there's young people,
[1:53:20] elders,
[1:53:22] some at the very beginning, maybe some
[1:53:24] at the very end.
[1:53:26] But Lord, I know you are faithful until
[1:53:28] the end.
[1:53:30] You said you would be with us, even
[1:53:32] dwell in us, make us your temple
[1:53:36] to the end of the world.
[1:53:38] I'm so grateful for that today, Lord.
[1:53:42] Oh Jesus.
[1:53:44] Lord, I surrender to you today. I I
[1:53:47] can't build the temple myself, but I
[1:53:48] surrender to your will and to your way.
[1:53:52] Oh Lord, you have laid a foundation in
[1:53:55] my life. Finish the work, oh Lord.
[1:53:59] Finish the work, oh God, until I go by
[1:54:03] way of rapture. If the Lord if you come
[1:54:05] or by way of grave if you tar and come
[1:54:08] in the resurrection
[1:54:10] Lord finish the work. That's the cry of
[1:54:13] our heart. Lord we're not crying for a
[1:54:15] beginning. We're not even crying for a
[1:54:17] denominational form of Pentecost but our
[1:54:20] desire Lord finish the work.
[1:54:23] Oh God your hands have laid the
[1:54:26] foundation.
[1:54:28] You will also lay
[1:54:31] the cornerstone.
[1:54:33] Thank you for that, Lord. I love you.
[1:54:37] Thank you for all that you've done.
[1:54:41] Lord, you mean so much to me this
[1:54:43] morning. I don't want to just say that
[1:54:46] in front of people, but I do want to say
[1:54:48] it in front of people.
[1:54:51] I want these kids to know, Lord, that I
[1:54:54] may have been I may have made many
[1:54:56] mistakes, and I'm not a perfect person,
[1:54:58] but I know I'm forgiven.
