[44:19] we thank you for the opportunity that we
[44:21] have to come and hear your word once
[44:23] again
[44:25] father changes where we need to be
[44:26] changed sometimes lord you put us in
[44:30] different situations sometimes a little
[44:32] bit difficult
[44:33] just to see how we'll react to help us
[44:36] to examine ourselves in order to
[44:37] see what we are what we're made of
[44:41] father you know what we are and we don't
[44:44] hear your elect but lord we need to know
[44:46] that
[44:47] father i pray that every one of us would
[44:49] recognize who we are and
[44:52] we are not a hotbed plant lord or
[44:54] somebody that can stand
[44:56] in spite of all the difficulties of this
[44:58] life that
[44:59] lord would you shine down on us you can
[45:02] make us to be a witness to the world
[45:04] father i thank you for all that you've
[45:06] done all that's been said and done
[45:07] already in the service
[45:08] i pray that you just move lord in this
[45:11] service today
[45:12] help us to forget about the surroundings
[45:14] lord and think about you
[45:16] you said we're two or three are together
[45:18] together i will be in there
[45:20] if you are here lord that there's
[45:22] nothing that you can't do
[45:24] thank you for that amen
[45:29] amen god bless you this morning turn
[45:32] with me to zachariah chapter 4 and verse
[45:34] 8.
[45:38] zechariah chapter 4 and verse 8. thank
[45:41] you for being patient with us we may do
[45:43] this for a couple of weeks but probably
[45:45] no more than that
[45:46] makes you appreciate what you have
[45:48] doesn't it i haven't seen though jt
[45:50] sit this close to the front in a long
[45:51] time
[45:55] yes we put the sausages at the front it
[45:57] wasn't intentional but
[46:00] at least it wasn't for me my children
[46:05] for the harvey might have done that
[46:08] we appreciate you coming this morning
[46:10] and being faithful to the house of lord
[46:12] and we're here to have a good time in
[46:14] the lord and to examine ourselves and
[46:16] just come up closer to him isn't that
[46:18] it's not always good to do
[46:20] but the david's on a little honeymoon
[46:22] trip with his wife
[46:24] this morning anniversary trip and
[46:27] so um we were getting the pews he was
[46:30] working on uh
[46:31] some folks getting the pews out and then
[46:33] pews were big and heavy
[46:35] the people that got him i don't think
[46:36] realize just how big and heavy
[46:38] they were so they come over and got half
[46:41] of them and there was two
[46:42] young men and i was kind of amused
[46:44] watching them load them up because they
[46:46] were supposed to load them up because we
[46:47] were giving it to them
[46:48] i stood there and watched them for a
[46:50] while and they they were getting tired
[46:52] and he
[46:53] paid the other young man to help him
[46:55] well they didn't show back up
[46:56] and we called them and the reason was
[46:58] because that other young man
[46:59] blocked his phone number he wasn't going
[47:02] to come back and help
[47:03] do that look at him heavy fuse
[47:06] so a few of you brothers would stay
[47:09] around younger brothers
[47:11] who can do that after church he's
[47:13] supposed to show up after the service
[47:14] today
[47:15] and get the rest of those if he doesn't
[47:17] we'll have to move them anyway
[47:18] so there's only eight left so surely
[47:21] between us we can do that today amen
[47:24] and we appreciate you know i appreciate
[47:27] the continuity that
[47:28] we've had over the years uh been able to
[47:31] have church in the same place and things
[47:33] and
[47:34] but change is not always a bad thing
[47:36] sometimes it's a good thing
[47:38] and so we appreciate that and brother
[47:41] andrew glover will be here wednesday
[47:43] night that's what he's telling me he's
[47:45] going to go ahead and be here so we're
[47:46] going to have church here at the
[47:47] fellowship hall
[47:48] with brother andrew on wednesday night
[47:50] so you come and
[47:52] bring your shouting shoes if you know
[47:53] anybody that could be touched by
[47:55] andrew's ministry and bible in common
[47:57] and i'm sure it will be a blessing
[47:59] zachariah chapter 4 and verse 8 it says
[48:02] moreover the word of the lord came unto
[48:04] me
[48:05] saying the hands of zerubbabel have laid
[48:08] the foundation of this house
[48:11] his hands shall also finish it so he
[48:14] laid the foundation
[48:15] his hands shall also finish it and thou
[48:18] shalt know that the lord of hosts
[48:20] has sent me unto you for who hath
[48:23] despised the day of small things
[48:26] for they shall rejoice and shall see the
[48:28] plummet
[48:29] in the hand of zerubbabel with those
[48:31] seven they are the eyes of the lord
[48:33] which run to and fro
[48:35] through the whole earth i pray the lord
[48:37] with that his blessing to the word
[48:39] this morning will be seated i want to
[48:42] talk to us this morning about
[48:43] multiplying
[48:45] by faith and grace multiplying by
[48:49] faith and grace
[48:54] god's people have always been
[48:56] underestimated
[48:59] and the reason for that is because the
[49:01] enemy often fails to account for the
[49:03] fact that
[49:04] faith and grace are multiplying
[49:07] factors and i got to thinking about
[49:10] multiplication the other day which is a
[49:12] lot for me
[49:13] because i didn't have very much
[49:14] schooling and so i got to thinking about
[49:17] it though and
[49:17] as i began to think about it i began to
[49:20] look at the parts of it and i asked my
[49:22] kids because they knew better than i did
[49:24] about what multiplication was and what
[49:26] the i have a hidden helper here behind
[49:29] the screen
[49:30] but what the parts of multiplication
[49:33] were
[49:34] and they told me that there are factors
[49:36] i believe is what they said and then
[49:38] they said that there is a product
[49:42] and so the factor is the first factor is
[49:46] our
[49:46] efforts now but random says that god
[49:48] doesn't do anything apart from man
[49:53] god doesn't do anything apart from man
[49:55] what that means is
[49:56] that jp uses us that's right god's going
[49:59] to do anything he does it through you
[50:01] and you're never so young or so old or
[50:03] so weak or so
[50:05] uh so sick or whatever it is that you're
[50:07] going through in your life you're never
[50:09] so a troubled whatever it might be that
[50:12] he can't use you
[50:14] yeah right he uses even your weaknesses
[50:17] becomes strengths right and i've seen
[50:20] many times that a person maybe
[50:22] would be used by god in a certain
[50:24] measure and then something
[50:25] bad happen to them they go through a
[50:27] really hard time in their life but all
[50:29] of a sudden
[50:30] god begins to use them that much more
[50:32] instead of less why is that because
[50:35] god blesses those efforts that much more
[50:37] he's able to multiply that effort so
[50:40] that's the first factor that goes in
[50:42] and then faith and grace are there now
[50:44] without grace we couldn't even be called
[50:46] to make an effort
[50:48] right right we can't even abraham didn't
[50:50] know who god was
[50:52] he had no idea that there was a one god
[50:56] he was making idols in the god shop he
[50:58] was there
[50:59] creating this pagan helping to
[51:01] perpetuate this pagan myth
[51:03] and god spoke to abraham and said i'm
[51:06] going to make a great nation out of you
[51:10] now that's pretty that's pretty
[51:12] difficult isn't it it's pretty
[51:14] difficult to believe that oh god how is
[51:16] god going to do that but abraham
[51:17] believes god
[51:18] why he was chosen by god god knew it
[51:21] before you ever asked him god knew
[51:23] that he was gonna listen to him
[51:27] and so god already knew that you would
[51:28] put forth the effort that's why you hear
[51:30] this morning that you have put towards
[51:32] an effort to come to the house of god
[51:33] god knew you would do that and because
[51:36] of that he then he provides
[51:38] faith for you and grace for you to
[51:40] multiply
[51:41] and when faith and grace come in it
[51:43] multiplies that effort that you have
[51:46] and those factors produce a product
[51:48] which is the manifestation of the word
[51:50] of the hour that you live in
[51:53] right faith and grace together bring
[51:56] about the manifested word of the album
[51:58] you can see that with mary mary doesn't
[52:00] know who she is
[52:02] one day gabriel spoke to her and said
[52:04] listen i found my women
[52:06] what was it it was it was god was
[52:09] speaking to her
[52:10] and and providing to her the grace the
[52:12] grace was in the message
[52:15] the fact that she heard it was grace
[52:19] the fact that she could understand it
[52:21] was grace
[52:22] are you with me this morning i know
[52:25] there's an echo it's hard to listen but
[52:26] but just bear with me this morning
[52:28] because it's grace doing here
[52:31] is grace that we can understand if he
[52:34] comes to us that's the grace of god
[52:36] and so the fact that that the angel
[52:38] spoke to her was grace and then
[52:40] when she heard it she accepted it and
[52:42] what part did she have to do with it she
[52:44] said be it unto me
[52:46] so she did have a thought but it wasn't
[52:47] a part of producing a child
[52:50] but it was a part of receiving the word
[52:53] so her part was to receive the word and
[52:54] said me and and to me and she said
[52:56] be unto me according to thy word what
[52:58] happened that began to be multiplied in
[53:00] her life
[53:02] and she produced the word of the hour
[53:03] now there's something
[53:05] in science in military science called a
[53:07] force multiplier
[53:10] and force multiplication refers to a
[53:12] factor or a combination of factors
[53:14] against
[53:15] personnel or weapons the ability to
[53:18] accomplish
[53:19] greater feats than without so
[53:22] if you have a you add a weapon and it
[53:26] multiplies the force
[53:27] beyond what it what it should does that
[53:30] makes sense so
[53:32] if you had a highly trained navy seal
[53:35] you add him to a bunch of raw army
[53:37] recruits
[53:38] that navy seal is the force multiplier
[53:42] just him being there is enough to make a
[53:45] difference
[53:45] beyond just one person
[53:48] right and so sometimes many times
[53:52] we are asked to do things beyond our
[53:55] abilities
[53:57] right god speaks to us and he asked us
[53:59] to to take on a project
[54:01] if you can put it like that beyond our
[54:03] abilities
[54:04] but he gives us a forced multiplier
[54:06] which is faith and grace in your life
[54:09] and he puts that into your life and then
[54:11] when you believe god it multiplies
[54:15] because when you put that seed down in
[54:17] that
[54:18] atmosphere it can't do anything else
[54:21] and you can't stop it from multiplying
[54:25] no matter how much you tried it once
[54:26] it's in that atmosphere it's got to
[54:28] multiply
[54:29] and so it has a different effectiveness
[54:32] than what it would have
[54:33] normally leviticus 26-8 speaks to us of
[54:38] you know some of god's man god's math is
[54:40] different from ours
[54:42] it says five of you so chasing a hundred
[54:45] if i did the math right that's 20
[54:47] 20 per person right
[54:51] five will chase a hundred he says but a
[54:54] hundred
[54:55] you should put ten thousand of white
[55:00] what happened it's a
[55:05] fall before you by foreign sword that's
[55:07] 100 per person
[55:09] so fighting you'll chase a hundred a
[55:11] hundred of you should put ten thousand
[55:13] of white
[55:15] they found that two oxen do not pour
[55:18] twice as much as one
[55:20] right they pull a hundred times
[55:24] as much they don't pull twice as much
[55:27] but it's a force multiplier if they're
[55:29] yoked together
[55:30] that they're falling different
[55:31] directions it'll take away
[55:34] but if they're born the same direction
[55:35] that's what we are jesus said my yoke is
[55:37] easy my burden is life
[55:39] we're yoked together and when god puts
[55:41] us together with faith with grace with
[55:43] each other
[55:44] what happens we do far more than what
[55:47] our number suggests
[55:51] be with me this morning far more so god
[55:53] asks you
[55:55] to do something and to believe something
[55:58] that's incredible now
[56:02] he asked the disciples much the same
[56:04] thing in john 6
[56:06] and 5 jesus has been preaching to a
[56:10] whole bunch of people
[56:13] and he looked up his eyes and saw a
[56:15] great company coming to him and he said
[56:16] them to
[56:17] philip i love the way he does this
[56:20] he looks over it one of the deacons he
[56:22] says what are we going to give them to
[56:23] eat
[56:27] if i looked through the market and we
[56:29] had 5 000 people here this morning and
[56:31] said by the way we're having a potluck
[56:34] huh so you you can deal with it i'm
[56:38] going to mcdonald's right
[56:40] that would be my fault
[56:44] philip doesn't know he says but it says
[56:46] this he said to prove him for he himself
[56:48] knew what he would do
[56:50] you have to remember god always knows
[56:52] what he's going to do
[56:54] right but he asked philip to prove it
[56:56] and philip vasner and even said 200
[56:58] penny worth of bread
[56:59] is not sufficient for them so philip
[57:02] uses a ridiculous number if any worth
[57:04] is one day's wages 200 days wages almost
[57:08] a year
[57:09] of work but it's not it's sufficient for
[57:11] them
[57:12] and we don't have nearly that much that
[57:15] every one of them would take a little
[57:17] and we wouldn't even buy enough for each
[57:19] one of them to have just a little bit
[57:22] one of his disciples and i love
[57:26] andrew if you go and study andrew in
[57:30] in the new testament he's always
[57:32] bringing people to jesus
[57:35] because andrew understood something that
[57:36] maybe the other disciples didn't
[57:38] that if you bring people to jesus jesus
[57:42] can do miraculous things
[57:45] and you at some point realize that all
[57:47] you have to do is get peter in the
[57:48] presence of jesus
[57:50] get the moral of the fish of those in
[57:52] the presence of jesus
[57:54] and andrew is constantly bringing people
[57:56] to jesus and so
[57:58] he doesn't realize that he uh
[58:02] he cannot um he cannot
[58:05] do this on his own he realizes that he
[58:08] has to do it
[58:09] with jesus now he says there's a lad
[58:11] here
[58:12] which have five barlinghoes and two
[58:14] small fishes
[58:16] but what are they among so many
[58:20] what are they among so many
[58:23] now
[58:26] he even doesn't know how god's going to
[58:28] do it but if you could get them in the
[58:30] presence of christ
[58:32] if we could only realize that girl went
[58:35] out and
[58:36] was naming the syrian and she was
[58:38] captured by them and she said oh
[58:39] if you can be in my country there's a
[58:42] prophet in my country
[58:44] if you can just be in the presence that
[58:46] i'm in if you can just partake of the
[58:48] word that i partake of
[58:49] i believe god could do something i don't
[58:51] know how but i believe he could do it
[58:55] and brother says this he said how could
[58:58] a man that could take five little pieces
[59:00] of fish and five biscuits
[59:02] and two pieces of fish and break them
[59:03] and feed five thousand
[59:05] not just wiggling fish he says but
[59:07] cooked fish
[59:10] not wiggling fish but cooked fish how'd
[59:12] he do it what kind of an atom did he
[59:14] turn
[59:14] loose what kind of power did he have
[59:19] not wiggling fish not i think you had to
[59:22] do something too but cooked
[59:25] one place but the red says seasoned fish
[59:29] it's got the lemon butter on it the
[59:30] herbs and spices whatever it is that you
[59:32] put
[59:33] on fish and so
[59:36] it's uh he doesn't even know
[59:39] uh he doesn't even he doesn't even leave
[59:42] it up to them
[59:44] how to uh how to season them how to cook
[59:48] them he just prepares it for him
[59:51] all right you've experienced power like
[59:53] that
[59:54] yeah so i've never seen anything like
[59:57] that yes we have
[1:00:00] he made you you
[1:00:03] he brought you out of what you were and
[1:00:06] prepared you
[1:00:07] and made you what you are today you
[1:00:09] don't live the way you knew because you
[1:00:10] just wanted to
[1:00:11] [Music]
[1:00:13] you look what you knew because god
[1:00:15] prepared you god made you that way now
[1:00:18] he said remember five thousand people
[1:00:19] have two fish took those little fellas
[1:00:21] and broke it off
[1:00:22] and handed it out broke off another
[1:00:23] piece and every time he said he'd break
[1:00:25] off another beast would be grown on
[1:00:27] he said cooked fish already cooked fried
[1:00:29] in crisp
[1:00:33] huh not just fried but pride and crisco
[1:00:36] i don't know why this is stuck but we'll
[1:00:37] get to it later
[1:00:40] isn't god good maybe god just wanted to
[1:00:43] speak directly to us today
[1:00:46] i just cooked but fighting crisco
[1:00:50] and so was prepared in the way that it
[1:00:52] wasn't just a fish dinner
[1:00:54] but it was the best fish dinner they
[1:00:55] ever had
[1:00:58] this was better than fred's sister
[1:01:03] why the master cooked it up
[1:01:06] [Music]
[1:01:07] every time you break it off another
[1:01:09] piece would go on already cooked and
[1:01:11] fried in disco ready to
[1:01:12] go he said what a person
[1:01:17] break off speaking of the bread raise up
[1:01:19] some weed don't cook it things like that
[1:01:20] the regular procedure
[1:01:22] he said but could bypass all of that
[1:01:24] just break off cooked bread
[1:01:26] and hand it out to them he says with
[1:01:28] brown crust on
[1:01:32] so he gives him cooked fish fried in
[1:01:33] crisco season
[1:01:37] he gives him bread making you hungry he
[1:01:40] gives him bread
[1:01:41] that's got a crust on him and you break
[1:01:43] it kind of snaps
[1:01:48] why he said take it and eat it what was
[1:01:51] it he was multitasking
[1:01:54] he was multiplying they brought it to
[1:01:56] him in faith here's five loaves two
[1:01:57] fishing and he multiplied it
[1:02:01] whatever efforts you take whether it's
[1:02:04] put some chairs now whether it's working
[1:02:06] and doing something for the for god
[1:02:07] if it's at home on your knees playing
[1:02:09] whatever effort you take
[1:02:11] it may seem small it may seem
[1:02:13] inconsequential but god multiplies
[1:02:25] the disciples would be out there
[1:02:26] testifying and they talk to one another
[1:02:28] and they begin to say
[1:02:29] when i saw him take those five biscuits
[1:02:31] and two fishes
[1:02:32] and break them i climbed up on the rock
[1:02:35] and looked over to see how he did it
[1:02:37] and i see that piece of fish in his hand
[1:02:39] he'd break it off
[1:02:40] and land over here and when he reached
[1:02:42] back again there would be another fish
[1:02:44] there
[1:02:44] not only a fish in the water but the
[1:02:46] fish are already raised and cooked and
[1:02:47] ready to go ready to eat
[1:02:49] he said when i saw him break that little
[1:02:52] loaf of bread and too laid out here
[1:02:54] he said but when he reached back again
[1:02:56] there was another loaf ready to be
[1:02:57] broken off again
[1:02:59] he said oh how he can grow bread
[1:03:03] amen oh how he can go away now what are
[1:03:06] we
[1:03:06] bad remember the wave sheep was weighing
[1:03:11] and then it come back on the day 50 days
[1:03:13] later
[1:03:19] he said i want to ask if there'd be a
[1:03:20] scientist he said here what kind of an
[1:03:22] atom did he turn loose at that time
[1:03:24] to make the regular wheat it was the
[1:03:26] same one he turned loose when he turned
[1:03:28] water into wine
[1:03:30] he's gone he does what he wants to
[1:03:33] very bad he does what he wants to and
[1:03:36] he's willing to do all things
[1:03:39] and give us exceedingly abundantly more
[1:03:42] than we could even think
[1:03:44] you believe that today if we will just
[1:03:46] let ourselves be turned loose
[1:03:48] in the faith in him
[1:03:51] he says that's where it lays his having
[1:03:53] faith in him to believe that he can
[1:03:57] to believe that he can for all things
[1:03:59] are possible how many things are
[1:04:00] possible
[1:04:04] all things are possible he said for all
[1:04:07] things are possible
[1:04:09] no matter what it is it's possible not
[1:04:11] only possible
[1:04:13] probable
[1:04:16] he said it will happen if you'll just
[1:04:18] believe it
[1:04:21] in luke 17 5
[1:04:24] the apostles turned to jesus and said
[1:04:26] unto the lord
[1:04:27] increase our faith
[1:04:30] increase our faith but multiply it
[1:04:34] and the lord said if he had faith in the
[1:04:36] grain of a mustard seed
[1:04:40] i would multiply that to be able to say
[1:04:42] that this psychomine tree be thou
[1:04:43] plucked up by the root
[1:04:45] without planting in the sea and it
[1:04:46] should obey you
[1:04:48] you have faith as a grain of a mustard
[1:04:50] seed let's talk about that for a moment
[1:04:52] and
[1:04:52] going somewhere just a little bit later
[1:04:54] so hang with me
[1:04:57] but the bible says understand the angel
[1:04:59] of god
[1:05:01] he said sometimes when a blessing is
[1:05:03] pronounced upon you he may not be
[1:05:06] that he can he can't get to you right
[1:05:07] then he said it might not be just
[1:05:10] instant healing but as you believe
[1:05:13] your faith will make you whole
[1:05:16] he said some people have spontaneous
[1:05:19] faith
[1:05:20] great faith that deep that's a miracle
[1:05:24] some of them have faith about that deep
[1:05:25] it'll take a little while
[1:05:27] sun has mustard seed faith very little
[1:05:31] but just stay with it it'll bring you
[1:05:33] out he said it'll materialize
[1:05:37] it'll materialize all right because the
[1:05:39] mustard seed is pure
[1:05:41] it can't be mixed with anything so if
[1:05:44] it's pure
[1:05:45] faith it'll materialize it'll multiply
[1:05:50] right it's got to that's the one of the
[1:05:52] factors in multiplication
[1:05:54] it's got to multiply it's just it's it's
[1:05:57] what it does
[1:05:59] you can't make it anything else five
[1:06:01] times
[1:06:02] five is whatever it is
[1:06:07] 25.
[1:06:09] [Music]
[1:06:11] it can't be nothing else it's been
[1:06:13] multiplied
[1:06:15] are you now if you have mustard seed
[1:06:16] faith for healing it's got to be healing
[1:06:19] take place
[1:06:21] why because the faith is pure it's a
[1:06:24] seed but a jp is there a spirit
[1:06:26] it can't be nothing else it's got to
[1:06:28] happen but
[1:06:29] but see we a lot of times we doubt that
[1:06:31] mustard seed and
[1:06:32] stuff here he said but it's without that
[1:06:34] immediate the smallest amount of faith
[1:06:36] but if it's pure
[1:06:38] it'll produce something in the end it'll
[1:06:40] bring healing
[1:06:41] but it may take time he said some people
[1:06:44] have spontaneously some people have
[1:06:46] just mustard seed faith he said but just
[1:06:48] stay with it it'll bring you out
[1:06:50] it'll materialize now god made a promise
[1:06:53] to abraham
[1:06:55] that he would multiply his seed he would
[1:06:58] multiply his seed in genesis 17
[1:07:00] 2 he said i will make my covenant
[1:07:02] between me and thee
[1:07:03] and i will multiply thee exceedingly
[1:07:07] now israel over time if you look at the
[1:07:10] nation of israel
[1:07:11] they would believe god for a while they
[1:07:13] would be multiplied
[1:07:14] and they would turn against god and it
[1:07:16] seemed like they'd come down to almost
[1:07:17] nothing
[1:07:19] they would believe god for a while they
[1:07:20] would be multiplied
[1:07:22] and turned god down again and come down
[1:07:25] to almost now
[1:07:27] but the perceived the promise was still
[1:07:29] there
[1:07:30] they had a promise of multiplication he
[1:07:32] said i will multiply thee
[1:07:34] exceedingly jeremiah 30 and 2.
[1:07:39] now when i read my text we read from
[1:07:42] zerubbabel that that's
[1:07:43] when that's when the temple was going up
[1:07:48] laid the foundation and he's encouraging
[1:07:50] this governor
[1:07:52] to come back as one was in the line of
[1:07:55] the kings but he was just a governor
[1:07:56] because
[1:07:57] they were still under that dominion of a
[1:07:59] foreign government
[1:08:00] but he's encouraging him and he said you
[1:08:02] laid the foundation you're going to
[1:08:04] bring forth the headstone right and
[1:08:07] and talks about that we'll get to it
[1:08:09] after a while but
[1:08:11] before that the reason why he could be
[1:08:13] encouraging he could believe is because
[1:08:15] the word had said
[1:08:17] that they would be doing what they're
[1:08:18] doing
[1:08:20] right so god made a promise that israel
[1:08:22] would be multiplied they may receive
[1:08:24] would be multiplied
[1:08:25] and then in jeremiah 30 and 2 he said
[1:08:28] jeremiah said let's speak with the lord
[1:08:30] god of israel saying
[1:08:31] write thee all the words that i have
[1:08:32] spoken unto thee in the book
[1:08:35] why all of them put it in a book because
[1:08:38] they wanted the people to be able to
[1:08:39] read what god said
[1:08:42] to remind them of the promise for all
[1:08:45] the days come say
[1:08:46] lord that i will bring in the captivity
[1:08:48] of my people israel and judah
[1:08:50] saith the lord i would cause them to
[1:08:51] return to the land that i gave to their
[1:08:54] fathers and they shall
[1:08:56] possess it he said for i am with thee
[1:09:00] saith the lord
[1:09:01] to save thee i love this promise it's
[1:09:04] jeremiah 30 and 11
[1:09:06] he said i am with you said the lord to
[1:09:08] save me though i make a full end
[1:09:10] of all nations
[1:09:14] now listen what he's saying though i
[1:09:16] make a full end of all nations
[1:09:18] whether i have scattered them now you
[1:09:21] don't hear people
[1:09:22] go around today saying uh talking about
[1:09:25] how that they're
[1:09:27] a certain nationality maybe the the
[1:09:29] ammonites are different ones the titles
[1:09:31] over there you don't hear people go
[1:09:32] around saying i'm a philistine
[1:09:35] i'm an ammonite but the jews are still
[1:09:38] here
[1:09:39] and he says all these nations without
[1:09:42] scattered me i'll make a full end of
[1:09:44] them
[1:09:45] you look at the nazi regime regime that
[1:09:47] was supposed to last
[1:09:49] for what a thousand years the third
[1:09:51] reich
[1:09:52] and it's completely destroyed it was
[1:09:55] gone in a few years why
[1:09:57] he said i'll make a full end of all
[1:09:59] nations whether i've scattered thee
[1:10:02] yet will i not make a full end of thee
[1:10:06] amen but i will correctly imagine
[1:10:10] i love this i will not leave thee
[1:10:12] altogether
[1:10:13] unpunished if you look at the
[1:10:16] jewish population over the years because
[1:10:18] he said you're multiplying he's talking
[1:10:20] about their population
[1:10:22] our multiply you see it exceedingly
[1:10:24] there's even a place in the scripture
[1:10:26] where it talks about
[1:10:27] the difference in judah and his teeth
[1:10:29] and then the seed of
[1:10:30] of another one of the other patriarchs
[1:10:33] that if you follow another line
[1:10:34] and it says that his seat was not
[1:10:36] multiplied like jesus
[1:10:38] because they have drums remember there
[1:10:41] was a promise to
[1:10:42] ishmael as well his seed would be
[1:10:44] multiplied
[1:10:46] but he said to the jews your feet will
[1:10:47] be multiplied if you look at that
[1:10:48] population over the years it goes up
[1:10:51] and then it drops off and goes up and it
[1:10:54] drops off it don't go like this
[1:10:57] but it goes up and down but in the end
[1:11:00] it's always more than it was
[1:11:04] and the longevity of the survival of it
[1:11:07] is amazing even to people who don't even
[1:11:09] believe in the gospel
[1:11:11] now if you look in
[1:11:15] at the population and i wish i could
[1:11:17] show that to you because i think the
[1:11:18] only graph
[1:11:19] if you look at this last hundred years
[1:11:21] or so it goes way up
[1:11:23] before the second world war and it goes
[1:11:25] down like this
[1:11:27] because there was the population drop
[1:11:29] off it wasn't 6 million jews died
[1:11:33] now before that time there was about
[1:11:35] there was about 18 million jews
[1:11:38] in the wrong six million of them one out
[1:11:41] of three
[1:11:44] you think about that one out of three
[1:11:47] jews were killed
[1:11:48] you think if anything would have ended
[1:11:50] that would have been him one out of
[1:11:54] three
[1:11:55] were killed and just now
[1:11:59] they say it depends on how you encounter
[1:12:01] if you can't only observe it jews
[1:12:04] they still haven't reached that number
[1:12:06] that 18 million number it's around
[1:12:08] 11 million today if you count those who
[1:12:11] are
[1:12:12] the children maybe not practicing but
[1:12:13] they have one jewish parent at least
[1:12:15] then just now has that number reached
[1:12:19] the pre-war number of 18 million jews
[1:12:22] but he said i'll multiply the
[1:12:23] exceedingly it doesn't mean it goes up
[1:12:25] to the straight line
[1:12:26] i hope you're following me faith and
[1:12:28] grace and multipliers
[1:12:30] but there's times when it dips down like
[1:12:32] this
[1:12:33] yeah there's time god there's times
[1:12:35] god's going to try you
[1:12:36] there's times god's going to let you go
[1:12:38] through things it doesn't mean you're
[1:12:39] not the seed of god
[1:12:41] it doesn't mean the blessing isn't still
[1:12:43] true it doesn't mean that you're not the
[1:12:45] seed of abraham the royal sea
[1:12:47] what does it mean it just means that god
[1:12:50] is working in your life
[1:12:52] so you took the graph of your life it's
[1:12:54] just like that population graph that
[1:12:55] goes up
[1:12:56] and then it comes down and it goes up
[1:12:58] and it comes down it's like the ocean
[1:13:00] and
[1:13:00] the end of it is the tides coming in it
[1:13:02] comes in a ways and it goes out
[1:13:04] then it comes a little farther and then
[1:13:06] it goes out don't you see that's what
[1:13:08] god's doing in your life because he's
[1:13:09] working
[1:13:10] he comes a little farther and we go
[1:13:11] through these seasons whether it's out
[1:13:13] we can go
[1:13:13] we'll never experience that again but
[1:13:15] you don't realize it's coming back
[1:13:17] stronger than it was because the
[1:13:20] promises of
[1:13:20] increase but it's not a promise that it
[1:13:22] would go up all the time
[1:13:27] but he says in jeremiah 30 17 he said
[1:13:29] for i will restore hell
[1:13:31] unto me now there's something that some
[1:13:34] of you that have been through it lately
[1:13:36] you can grab a hold of that promise i
[1:13:39] will restore
[1:13:40] health unto thee and i will heal me of
[1:13:43] thy womb saith the lord
[1:13:44] because they called me an outcast saying
[1:13:47] this is zion
[1:13:49] whom no man seeketh after
[1:13:52] verse 18 thus saith the lord behold i
[1:13:54] will bring again the captivity of
[1:13:56] jacob's gifts and have mercy
[1:13:58] on his blind places and the city should
[1:14:00] be building upon
[1:14:02] her own heat so may and i and the people
[1:14:05] building the city
[1:14:06] could look back at that so we're going
[1:14:08] to look back at that they could all look
[1:14:09] back and see
[1:14:10] there was a promise the city would be
[1:14:12] built again
[1:14:14] it was torn down it was just a heat but
[1:14:15] there was a promise it would come back
[1:14:17] out
[1:14:17] he said the palace shall remain after
[1:14:20] the manner thereof
[1:14:22] jeremiah 30 19 and out of them shall
[1:14:24] proceed thanksgiving
[1:14:26] and the voice within the nightmare and i
[1:14:29] will multiply them
[1:14:33] he said i will multiply them and they
[1:14:36] shall not be a few
[1:14:38] they shall not be few he said i will
[1:14:40] also glorify them they shall not be
[1:14:42] small
[1:14:43] now who's he telling that do you tell
[1:14:45] that to a bunch of people who are going
[1:14:46] into captivity
[1:14:48] they're about to spend 70 years in
[1:14:50] complete and total bondage
[1:14:53] but god says i'm also proud of it
[1:14:57] there shall not be a few when you're
[1:14:58] down there you won't be down there you
[1:15:00] won't be completely destroyed there will
[1:15:02] be a few
[1:15:03] even if it's just daniel even if the
[1:15:04] steps of three hundred children there
[1:15:06] will be a few that hold on
[1:15:08] and of those that code there will be
[1:15:10] there will be some that will return to
[1:15:12] this man
[1:15:14] multiply the nation only few i will also
[1:15:16] glorify them they shall not be small
[1:15:19] their children also should be as a
[1:15:21] fourth time all that ought to be a
[1:15:23] promise we can grab hold of this morning
[1:15:26] their children also should be as the
[1:15:28] fourth time
[1:15:29] their congregation should be established
[1:15:31] before me
[1:15:32] and i will punish all that oppressed
[1:15:38] and then me and mine
[1:15:41] and ezra and all the different ones that
[1:15:43] are participating there of course the
[1:15:44] building of the temple and the building
[1:15:46] of the wall
[1:15:47] they can all look at that and say we
[1:15:48] have a promise
[1:15:52] but we have a promise today yes if we
[1:15:55] bring it down
[1:15:56] let's look at our congregation is that
[1:15:58] their congregation shall be established
[1:16:00] before me that's a promise we have
[1:16:02] yeah that's a promise if we're a church
[1:16:04] that god meant to be here
[1:16:06] there may be ebbs and flows but we have
[1:16:07] a promise
[1:16:09] your children shall be as important and
[1:16:11] that really spoke to my heart now
[1:16:14] let's go to zechariah 4 and 1. if you
[1:16:16] can turn there with me
[1:16:18] zechariah if you have your bibles this
[1:16:19] morning that's where i pour it on i know
[1:16:20] everything's all
[1:16:22] mixed up but sometimes you know you have
[1:16:25] to
[1:16:26] if you leave your living room the same
[1:16:27] way all of your life things you know it
[1:16:29] just kind of gets old but sometimes you
[1:16:31] got to shake things up
[1:16:33] to reset your mind a little bit so
[1:16:37] zechariah 4 1 says the angel that talked
[1:16:40] with me came again
[1:16:43] and awakened me as a man that was waking
[1:16:44] out of his sleep
[1:16:46] and this is the proceeding verses for
[1:16:48] the text that we were in
[1:16:50] and said unto me what see is that
[1:16:54] and i said i am hooked and behold a
[1:16:56] candlestick all of gold
[1:16:58] with a bowl upon the top of it and his
[1:17:01] seven lamps thereon
[1:17:02] and seven pipes to the seven lamps which
[1:17:04] are upon the top thereof
[1:17:07] two olive trees by it one upon the right
[1:17:10] side of the ball and the other one
[1:17:11] on the left side thereof so i answered
[1:17:14] the space of the angel that talked with
[1:17:15] me saying what are these my lord
[1:17:17] and the angel that talked to me answered
[1:17:19] and said everybody knows that but these
[1:17:20] be i said no my lord
[1:17:22] he answered and speaking of me saying
[1:17:23] this is the word of the law of the lord
[1:17:25] unto the sarah battle it's saying not my
[1:17:28] mind no my power but by my spirit saith
[1:17:31] the lord of hosts
[1:17:33] listen the christ says who art thou are
[1:17:36] great mountain
[1:17:37] before israel shall become a plain yes
[1:17:41] he said he had faith in the grain of the
[1:17:43] mustard seed
[1:17:45] you say to this mountain be thou removed
[1:17:49] i better take those off i'm going to
[1:17:51] lose those if
[1:17:53] if you had that kind of faith then here
[1:17:54] it says who are celebrating mountain
[1:17:56] before israel who seemed to be the most
[1:17:58] inconsequential leader
[1:18:00] that they'd ever had right because he's
[1:18:03] leading a band of jews may not even make
[1:18:05] it
[1:18:06] he's not even he's captive to some other
[1:18:09] nation
[1:18:10] he's following the of a human king about
[1:18:12] changing his mind any minute
[1:18:15] right he seems to be the most
[1:18:16] inconsequential leader they ever had
[1:18:18] but he said who art thou a great
[1:18:19] mountain because the river blood shall
[1:18:20] become a plain
[1:18:21] he shall bring forth the headstone
[1:18:23] thereof with shouts
[1:18:26] notice crying grace grace unto it
[1:18:32] now we know that in the rapture sermon
[1:18:35] spoke of this message as the shout
[1:18:39] right the shout that was the first part
[1:18:42] of the rapture was the shout
[1:18:45] right the shout the voice of the trumpet
[1:18:48] now i'm not saying something didn't say
[1:18:50] we're going to read it in a minute
[1:18:52] so but look
[1:18:55] it just had to set in motion the shout
[1:18:57] had to happen to set motion becoming
[1:18:59] heads though
[1:19:01] and here but random uses the scripture
[1:19:04] and here he said he should bring forth
[1:19:06] the headstone they're up with shadows
[1:19:09] i want to tell you today that this has
[1:19:11] already taken place
[1:19:15] the shadow's already come we're not
[1:19:18] looking for a shout
[1:19:20] right the message is already here
[1:19:24] right so if the messenger is already
[1:19:26] here
[1:19:27] what comes next what's next now look
[1:19:30] here the headstone came though with
[1:19:33] shoutings
[1:19:34] crying out grace the message came
[1:19:38] declaring grace that brother brown says
[1:19:40] in the message of grace
[1:19:41] where he takes his scripture as his text
[1:19:43] he said we're all acquainted with the
[1:19:45] scripture that reads the bible
[1:19:46] we know that this was during the time of
[1:19:48] the preparation of the restoration of
[1:19:49] the temple
[1:19:50] and this rumble is a great prince
[1:19:52] amongst the people who had laid the
[1:19:54] foundation of the building
[1:19:56] he said now i want you to put on your
[1:19:57] spiritual thinking anointing jacket
[1:20:00] this morning as we think he's said this
[1:20:03] great prince had determined to rebuild
[1:20:05] the house of the lord
[1:20:06] and when he did he had laid the
[1:20:08] foundation stone
[1:20:10] he said and as we read on further we
[1:20:12] find out that god said
[1:20:13] zerupable has laid the foundation with
[1:20:16] his hands
[1:20:17] he shall also bring forth the heads
[1:20:19] though he said i want you to notice he
[1:20:21] never said he should bring towards the
[1:20:22] cornerstone
[1:20:23] he should bring forth the headstone and
[1:20:25] we know that the scripture says that
[1:20:27] jesus is the chief cornerstone
[1:20:28] and he's also the headstone do we
[1:20:30] believe that today jesus is the chief
[1:20:32] corner so he's also the headstone
[1:20:35] he said now we will think for a few
[1:20:36] minutes that the seventh church
[1:20:38] messenger was to restore the faith of
[1:20:40] the children
[1:20:41] back to the fathers in other words
[1:20:44] refilled the church again
[1:20:46] under the power of the spirit now look
[1:20:51] god made diplomas he would have arrived
[1:20:53] without spot or wrinkle
[1:20:55] he would multiply you everybody does
[1:20:58] follow wrinkle
[1:20:59] but now look what happened denomination
[1:21:01] come you saw a drop off
[1:21:04] a darkness come over the people but
[1:21:06] there was still a promise
[1:21:08] god was gonna restore and he takes a
[1:21:11] message that seems to be
[1:21:13] insignificant to the people he takes a
[1:21:16] message the theologians reject
[1:21:18] he takes a message that the world
[1:21:20] rejects he said well they rejected
[1:21:22] they've always rejected it
[1:21:24] that's no strange thing he takes a
[1:21:26] message that the world can't see nothing
[1:21:28] in
[1:21:29] and he takes that message and he used it
[1:21:31] to rebuild the church again
[1:21:32] under the power of the spirit he said
[1:21:33] not my power not by might but by my
[1:21:36] spirit said to the lord
[1:21:37] not by organization not by denomination
[1:21:40] but by the holy spirit do we really
[1:21:43] believe that
[1:21:44] yes do we really believe this enough i
[1:21:46] might not by power so it won't be by
[1:21:47] effort but it will be by the spirit it
[1:21:50] will be that multiplying factor
[1:21:52] that's what will make up the difference
[1:21:54] not by organization
[1:21:56] not by the nomination but by the holy
[1:21:58] spirit god will bring forth the church
[1:21:59] in the last day
[1:22:01] now he said zerubbabel the prince with
[1:22:03] joshua was the one
[1:22:04] that was to bring forth this headstock
[1:22:08] he had laid the foundation he had took
[1:22:10] the people back to the foundation
[1:22:12] entitled but now according to the
[1:22:15] prophecy that will come the headstone he
[1:22:17] said i want you to notice
[1:22:18] when the headstone comes the prince is
[1:22:21] going to cry out the message
[1:22:28] you see why the church went down and
[1:22:30] they went up in numbers but it didn't
[1:22:31] multiply in faith it didn't become the
[1:22:33] bride it was supposed to be
[1:22:35] why because there was no message of
[1:22:37] grace
[1:22:39] that message that multiplying factor had
[1:22:40] been lost
[1:22:42] but now it had to become a messenger
[1:22:44] with a message of grace
[1:22:48] crying grace grace because we have never
[1:22:51] made it if he kind works
[1:22:56] but to many people that's what the
[1:22:58] message cries
[1:23:00] works works and there is an effort like
[1:23:03] i said that's part of it
[1:23:05] but it's what is multiplied it's what
[1:23:08] god does it matters
[1:23:10] because i am fraternity different than
[1:23:12] in denominational preachers efforts in
[1:23:13] many ways
[1:23:15] and our efforts today we can measure our
[1:23:17] loyalty against denominational
[1:23:19] it may not measure up in some ways but
[1:23:22] that's not what he's looking at whatever
[1:23:23] effort we put forth
[1:23:25] when you're the best when you're the
[1:23:26] scene of god when you're the elect when
[1:23:27] there's faith and grace there
[1:23:29] he multiplies that
[1:23:33] so we come to the house of god without
[1:23:34] just an expectation of hearing a good
[1:23:36] sermon having fellowship with a few
[1:23:38] people
[1:23:38] and talking to a few people and things
[1:23:40] like that when we come to the house of
[1:23:42] god saying lord
[1:23:43] i believe whatever effort i put forth
[1:23:45] this morning maybe you're sick anymore
[1:23:47] maybe you didn't hardly have the money
[1:23:48] to drive the church but you said i'm
[1:23:50] going anyhow
[1:23:51] why what happened to god begin to put
[1:23:53] forth a multiplication of your efforts
[1:23:56] you come and healing begins to take
[1:23:57] place and salvation begins to take place
[1:23:59] in life
[1:24:00] because it was the works that they
[1:24:02] mentioned most
[1:24:03] it was by grace are we saved
[1:24:06] through faith let's go to nehemiah 4 and
[1:24:10] 1.
[1:24:14] now after the events of zechariah 4
[1:24:17] after ezra after the temple has been
[1:24:19] built
[1:24:21] there had to become a time when the
[1:24:23] walls would be rebuilt
[1:24:27] and so under this the same message
[1:24:31] under this same now that the temple had
[1:24:33] been restored the church had been
[1:24:34] rebuilding to restore back to the faith
[1:24:36] of the father
[1:24:37] there had to come a time when the people
[1:24:39] works to build the walls
[1:24:42] and i believe that's the hour that we
[1:24:43] live in today
[1:24:45] we're we're building we're doing
[1:24:47] something we ought to always be building
[1:24:50] and we're just sitting there watching
[1:24:52] things crumble
[1:24:54] if you own a home you know that if you
[1:24:55] just leave it it's gonna fall apart
[1:24:57] that's right
[1:24:59] right but if you if you again if you
[1:25:02] keep it up
[1:25:03] you've got to constantly improve it
[1:25:05] there's no middle ground
[1:25:07] because if the nature of matter or
[1:25:10] things that are even our bodies is to
[1:25:12] decay
[1:25:14] it's just the nature of the world that
[1:25:16] we lived in everything
[1:25:17] decays everything falls apart
[1:25:21] and so you have to build now in nehemiah
[1:25:24] 401 it says but it came to pass when the
[1:25:25] symbol had heard
[1:25:27] and we built the wall so here they were
[1:25:28] building they come back and you know the
[1:25:30] story how that
[1:25:31] how does the king send him back and he
[1:25:34] comes into jerusalem with just a few
[1:25:35] people
[1:25:37] and he begins to rebuild the wall
[1:25:39] because the temple won't last without
[1:25:41] the walls without the structure
[1:25:44] being there to protect it he gets to
[1:25:46] rebuild that wall he was roth and
[1:25:49] the same with that of course when you
[1:25:51] begin to rebuild the wall there's going
[1:25:52] to be persecution
[1:25:53] there's going to be there's always going
[1:25:55] to be people say you can't do it
[1:25:58] because that's easy to say
[1:26:01] right it's easy to tell somebody you
[1:26:03] can't can't be done
[1:26:05] it's a lot harder to do
[1:26:09] that's why the the scientists did with
[1:26:11] the boundaries that we were talking
[1:26:12] about how that they
[1:26:13] said you couldn't well if you rolled a
[1:26:14] ball for more than 30 miles an hour fall
[1:26:16] off the end of the earth
[1:26:17] it proved that you can only go so fast
[1:26:20] most of us
[1:26:21] travel much faster than that we went in
[1:26:22] church this morning
[1:26:25] right and what was it because it's easy
[1:26:27] to say you can't be done
[1:26:29] it's a whole lot harder to say i'm going
[1:26:31] to do it
[1:26:34] we're going to do it so he took grand
[1:26:36] indignation and locked the juice
[1:26:39] and but now let me stop there because
[1:26:43] why does he mock because you can't stop
[1:26:46] it
[1:26:48] right so if you've got somebody mocking
[1:26:50] you
[1:26:52] and i don't know you may not but perhaps
[1:26:54] you feel
[1:26:55] sometimes the world is blocking you
[1:26:56] maybe somebody looks at your life and
[1:26:58] the way that you live and
[1:26:59] said that's crazy why do you even try
[1:27:02] why even trying to rebuild that life
[1:27:04] why even try maybe maybe you've been
[1:27:06] through some things
[1:27:08] people say why do you even try why not
[1:27:10] just eat drinks and be merry
[1:27:12] why even put forth the effort see why do
[1:27:16] they say that because they can't stop it
[1:27:19] if they can stop it if the enemy of
[1:27:21] faith could stop what's going on
[1:27:23] he wouldn't try to bless you he wouldn't
[1:27:25] kind of mock you he just stopped you
[1:27:28] right right the fact that he can't stop
[1:27:32] the fact he's mocking you means he can't
[1:27:34] stop you
[1:27:35] so take that for encouragement
[1:27:39] right and so verse two says he spake
[1:27:41] before his brethren
[1:27:43] in the army of samaria and said what do
[1:27:46] these
[1:27:46] people choose these people jews
[1:27:51] weak jews will they fortify themselves
[1:27:54] will they sacrifice will they make in
[1:27:56] the end of the day will they revive the
[1:27:58] stones out of the heaps of the rubbish
[1:28:00] which are burned
[1:28:01] and long as he criticizes four things he
[1:28:03] criticized their fortification
[1:28:05] he said will they will they fortify
[1:28:08] themselves
[1:28:09] they can't protect themselves what is he
[1:28:12] doing when he criticizes
[1:28:14] our fortification he's criticizing the
[1:28:15] word
[1:28:17] right because that was given to us for
[1:28:18] our fortification he criticized their
[1:28:20] worship
[1:28:22] he said will they glorify themselves
[1:28:23] will they sacrifice
[1:28:25] what those people think they're doing
[1:28:27] trying to worship
[1:28:28] after the walls have been torn down
[1:28:32] he criticized their expectations they
[1:28:34] said
[1:28:35] will they make at the end of the day
[1:28:38] it's too late to build the wall
[1:28:42] oh god we can just realize that's what
[1:28:44] i'm saying you're trying to tell people
[1:28:45] today
[1:28:46] right it doesn't matter like my father
[1:28:49] building a church why bother
[1:28:50] going and doing the things that you know
[1:28:52] why bother doing that because
[1:28:54] we're still here there's something for
[1:28:57] us to do
[1:28:58] but let's see we'll say why bother doing
[1:29:01] that what's the point
[1:29:02] what's the point do we criticize your
[1:29:04] expectation are you going to build them
[1:29:06] today
[1:29:07] look at the world that's falling apart
[1:29:09] around you
[1:29:11] but if god inspires you to build it
[1:29:14] it'll be built in a timely enough manner
[1:29:17] for it to be used
[1:29:21] he criticized his potential
[1:29:24] he said well they revived the stones out
[1:29:27] of the heaps of the rubbish
[1:29:28] and look at this place even the stones
[1:29:30] are burned
[1:29:31] they're knocked down there's not a
[1:29:34] warhammer left standing
[1:29:36] will they revive the stones but i want
[1:29:39] to tell you that's exactly what they did
[1:29:42] there's no record that i could find when
[1:29:44] they brought any new material
[1:29:46] to building the wall
[1:29:49] they didn't go and haul in new locks and
[1:29:53] they didn't have the ability to go ahead
[1:29:54] and do what did they do they built up
[1:29:56] what was there
[1:29:59] it was fallen it was dark it was it was
[1:30:01] smokey it was burnt but it was still
[1:30:04] gloss
[1:30:05] are you with me today it was still the
[1:30:07] city that got lowered on the bill
[1:30:11] this message hasn't come hasn't taken a
[1:30:13] trajectory like this
[1:30:14] we thought it would it would just go on
[1:30:16] up and keep increasing until 77 we'd all
[1:30:19] go home
[1:30:20] we didn't do that it went up
[1:30:24] and it seems like things happen but it
[1:30:27] is
[1:30:27] it seems like we're in a message with
[1:30:29] the people it's because we're human
[1:30:30] beings
[1:30:32] every generation comes that they have
[1:30:34] their own revival it goes up
[1:30:36] it comes back down a little goes up it
[1:30:37] comes back down a little doctrines come
[1:30:40] people come some leave the message don't
[1:30:42] do whatever that they do
[1:30:44] and so and the enemy comes by and says
[1:30:45] what are you even doing are you to
[1:30:47] rebuild this but it's still god's city
[1:30:51] stupid homes to him verse 3 says not to
[1:30:54] buy the am and i was buying
[1:30:57] he said even that which they build if
[1:30:58] the fox go up
[1:31:00] he shall even break down their wall
[1:31:04] this is just amazing to me nehemiah 4 6
[1:31:07] he said don't don't leave the wall
[1:31:10] oh the wall was joined together he said
[1:31:13] him to the half there
[1:31:14] halfway up he said for the people had a
[1:31:17] mind
[1:31:18] to work verse 7 but it came to pass that
[1:31:22] when samuel led him to buy in the
[1:31:23] arabians
[1:31:24] and the ammonites and the asteroids
[1:31:25] heard that the walls of jerusalem were
[1:31:27] made up
[1:31:28] and that the preachers begin to be soft
[1:31:30] then they were very rough when the enemy
[1:31:32] gets very angry when you make up the
[1:31:35] breaches now think about this in your
[1:31:36] own life
[1:31:37] when you begin to get strong brother get
[1:31:39] in an area where you were weak
[1:31:41] the enemy likes to mock you over that
[1:31:44] because he's going to attack you with a
[1:31:45] tackle attacking that same place
[1:31:47] because he doesn't believe that you
[1:31:49] fortified it
[1:31:52] but you hold on to the word right
[1:31:54] because you say well i used to smoke
[1:31:56] death i don't smoke the more
[1:31:58] i used to drink i don't drink no more i
[1:32:00] used to run around do things that were
[1:32:01] wrong i don't do that anymore
[1:32:03] why the enemy will keep coming back
[1:32:04] against that breach now why were they
[1:32:06] angry
[1:32:07] because how could they steal kill and
[1:32:08] destroy the walls
[1:32:16] see these things are given to us for our
[1:32:17] protection you can look at it like
[1:32:19] a church you can look at it like a body
[1:32:21] of believers because
[1:32:23] this is given to us for protection and
[1:32:25] you see it when people begin to fall
[1:32:27] away it's like a
[1:32:28] coal is still a live corpse you take it
[1:32:30] out the other calls it will die much
[1:32:31] quicker
[1:32:34] why because it doesn't have the other
[1:32:36] goals to keep it alive
[1:32:38] and the church is not given to us for
[1:32:41] just to take our money
[1:32:43] that's not what the church has given for
[1:32:45] it's not given just to
[1:32:47] so we can promote some man to a great
[1:32:49] position
[1:32:50] but the church is our protection it's
[1:32:53] going to be a pastor
[1:32:54] sits like a watchman on a wall and
[1:32:56] watches it and tries to make sure the
[1:32:57] best you can that the word is being
[1:32:59] preached
[1:32:59] is pure and you sit there and you're
[1:33:03] able
[1:33:03] even though the enemy may come against
[1:33:05] you and come against you but you come
[1:33:06] you hear the word of god that fortifies
[1:33:08] you
[1:33:10] so no wonder the devil gets mad when the
[1:33:12] breaches begin to be stopped
[1:33:14] begins to be very angry and nehemiah 48
[1:33:18] it says they conspired all of them
[1:33:20] together to come and to fight against
[1:33:22] jerusalem
[1:33:23] and to hinder it he said nevertheless we
[1:33:26] made our prayer into our god
[1:33:28] and set a watch against them day and
[1:33:30] night because of them
[1:33:33] now watch nehemiah
[1:33:46] and judah said
[1:33:50] now look here was samuel he was tobiah
[1:33:52] you expected them to be like that
[1:33:54] right they're the enemies of god
[1:33:57] you expect them to say things that are
[1:34:00] negative
[1:34:02] but judy got to listen to the news so
[1:34:04] much
[1:34:08] that he began to repeat what they had to
[1:34:09] say
[1:34:12] judah began to repeat it and the
[1:34:15] scripture says and
[1:34:16] judah said the strength of the bearers
[1:34:19] of burdens is decay
[1:34:21] we just can't do this anymore
[1:34:24] how many people have left the church
[1:34:26] because we just can't take it anymore
[1:34:28] our strength is decayed and there's it
[1:34:31] says
[1:34:32] much rubbish look at liberals you know
[1:34:35] it's all over the place
[1:34:36] but god was gonna use that rubbish to
[1:34:38] build along with it
[1:34:41] be careful what you look at as rubbish
[1:34:44] it might be building materials to god
[1:34:49] but they said there's much rubbish down
[1:34:51] there at the church
[1:34:54] so we're not able to build the wall
[1:34:57] it's easy to make excuses whenever
[1:34:58] things against jesus
[1:35:00] it says in our adversary said they shall
[1:35:03] not know neither see
[1:35:04] until we come to the midst amendment of
[1:35:06] slavery and cause the word disease so he
[1:35:08] says
[1:35:08] here judah was repeating what their
[1:35:10] adversaries had to say
[1:35:13] and it came to pass when the jews would
[1:35:15] stop by them came
[1:35:17] they said unto us ten times
[1:35:20] it says from all places when she were
[1:35:22] you shall return
[1:35:23] unto us they will be upon you so the
[1:35:26] jews there were jews there that were
[1:35:27] still
[1:35:28] in the land you remember not all of them
[1:35:29] left in the captivity
[1:35:31] there was something that was still in
[1:35:32] the land but they dwelt among the
[1:35:33] samaritans and the
[1:35:34] arabs and different ones that have
[1:35:35] different tribes didn't come in
[1:35:37] and the jews that were left begin to
[1:35:39] come in and when they come in they
[1:35:41] brought a negative
[1:35:42] report 10 tries 10 times
[1:35:45] they brought a negative report isn't
[1:35:47] that exactly what happened with joshua
[1:35:49] and caleb
[1:35:51] ken lim brought back a negative report
[1:35:53] but joshua and kevin said we're more
[1:35:55] than able right
[1:35:59] now nehemiah could have done two things
[1:36:01] he could have stopped the work
[1:36:02] and waited on them to attack or he could
[1:36:05] make preparations for the attack
[1:36:08] and keep the work going all right now
[1:36:11] the attack was coming
[1:36:13] but they said the best offense is a good
[1:36:15] defense
[1:36:16] so the best thing to do to make sure
[1:36:19] that the attack's not going to come or
[1:36:21] to make them think about it before they
[1:36:23] do it is to arm yourselves
[1:36:26] right so you're going to arm yourself
[1:36:28] you're going to pick up the word of god
[1:36:30] and you're going to harm yourself and
[1:36:32] you're going to
[1:36:33] you're going to use that but you're not
[1:36:35] going to quit working
[1:36:37] right right you're not going to quit
[1:36:39] living you're not going to quit
[1:36:40] testifying
[1:36:41] you're not going to quit being a
[1:36:42] christian and shining the light but
[1:36:43] you're going to harm yourself with the
[1:36:44] word of god
[1:36:46] so the people begin to kept building the
[1:36:48] walls as they kept building the wall
[1:36:50] he said therefore i said i am in the
[1:36:51] lower places behind the wall and all the
[1:36:53] higher places
[1:36:54] some of them that could be seen some of
[1:36:56] them that could not be seen
[1:36:57] he said i even set the people after
[1:36:59] their families with
[1:37:00] their source their spirits
[1:37:04] and their votes
[1:37:07] he didn't say now now if they come i'll
[1:37:10] fight for you
[1:37:11] what he said take him up take a sword
[1:37:14] take his spear see the preacher don't
[1:37:18] come on sunday morning to fight for you
[1:37:20] over the last part of it but he comes to
[1:37:22] hand you about
[1:37:23] hand you a sword hand you a spear to arm
[1:37:25] you with the word of god
[1:37:27] so that the work can keep going
[1:37:31] because as long as we're here the work
[1:37:33] needs to keep going
[1:37:35] as long as we're here there's still many
[1:37:37] missions to be to do
[1:37:39] as long as we're still here there'll
[1:37:40] still be neighbors to testify
[1:37:42] as long as we're still here we'll keep
[1:37:43] the church we'll keep remodeling we'll
[1:37:45] keep doing things why
[1:37:46] because we're here and we're supposed to
[1:37:49] work
[1:37:49] while we get ready in the fight
[1:37:54] the fact that we're still humans there's
[1:37:55] something for us to do
[1:37:58] god has preserved us for this time
[1:38:00] there's something for us to do nehemiah
[1:38:02] 4 14
[1:38:03] says i looked and rose up and said of
[1:38:05] the nobles to the rulers to us to the
[1:38:06] people be not be afraid of them
[1:38:08] remember the lord or let's did you get
[1:38:10] nothing else out of the sermon today
[1:38:13] remember that he said remember the lord
[1:38:16] be not afraid remember the lord which is
[1:38:18] great and terrible
[1:38:19] you shouldn't fight for your brethren
[1:38:23] he never set fight for yourselves but he
[1:38:26] said fight for your brethren
[1:38:28] your sons and your daughters your wives
[1:38:30] and your houses
[1:38:32] all that god's across the men today that
[1:38:34] would be willing to stand at the wall
[1:38:36] and with one hand
[1:38:37] begin to keep the work going with the
[1:38:39] other hand hold the sword of the word of
[1:38:41] god and stand there and fight for their
[1:38:43] wives in their houses and
[1:38:44] fight for their sons and their daughters
[1:38:46] and fight for their brethren
[1:38:54] it's easy to talk about how to criticize
[1:38:56] the bones can you fight for him
[1:39:00] in my 4 15 that came to pass when our
[1:39:02] enemies heard that it was known unto us
[1:39:04] amen god had brought their counsel to
[1:39:07] not we returned all of us to the wall
[1:39:09] and everyone to his work and if you go
[1:39:12] down to chapter six it says to the wall
[1:39:14] verse 15 so the wall was finished in the
[1:39:17] 25th day of the month of little in 52
[1:39:19] days
[1:39:20] 52 days they rebuilt the wall
[1:39:24] now that's without any tractors without
[1:39:27] any bulldozers
[1:39:30] it wasn't a small area they rebuilt the
[1:39:32] wall
[1:39:33] in 52 days no wonder if tobiah looked at
[1:39:37] it whether it was a massive
[1:39:44] 52 days you know what they found in
[1:39:47] 2007.
[1:39:49] in 2007 archaeologists there was a
[1:39:51] there's a tower called david's tower
[1:39:53] in jerusalem in the old city and it
[1:39:55] began to crumble
[1:39:56] and they so they went into current
[1:39:58] restoration work and doing that they had
[1:39:59] to dig it out
[1:40:00] and as it began to dig they found
[1:40:02] something they found a wall
[1:40:05] that was built in the time of nehemiah
[1:40:09] you go look it up they're called
[1:40:11] nehemiah's wall
[1:40:12] they found that wall it's still there
[1:40:16] a wall built in 52 days 2500 years later
[1:40:23] don't tell god that something can't last
[1:40:26] don't tell god that he's not big enough
[1:40:28] to make you laugh
[1:40:30] are you with me today maybe you just got
[1:40:32] shaved have you been saved for 40 years
[1:40:34] but don't tell god that he's not big
[1:40:35] enough to keep you going
[1:40:39] the wall is still there here you go i've
[1:40:40] got pictures of it on the internet the
[1:40:42] wall is still there they've still got
[1:40:44] the ability to go back and look at those
[1:40:45] stuff
[1:40:46] and you can see the wrong house that
[1:40:47] they built it out of
[1:40:49] built it out of just the rebels that was
[1:40:51] there but it's a war and it stood
[1:40:53] for 2500 years still found remnants of
[1:40:57] it why
[1:40:58] god inspired them to build that law
[1:41:02] god give you the inspiration to do it
[1:41:04] until it'll last
[1:41:07] how did they do it god did it
[1:41:12] nehemiah 6 and 16 it came to pass when
[1:41:15] all of our enemies hurt thereof all the
[1:41:18] heathen that were about to saw these
[1:41:19] things
[1:41:20] they were much cast down in their own
[1:41:23] eyes
[1:41:27] they were cast down in their own eyes
[1:41:29] for they perceived
[1:41:31] that this work was rock of our god
[1:41:37] there's a wall built in 52 days
[1:41:40] big enough to defend god's people for
[1:41:43] hundreds of years
[1:41:46] don't tell god he doesn't know what he's
[1:41:47] doing oh god help you today too many
[1:41:50] times i doubt
[1:41:51] to seek doubt you can't mix doubt and
[1:41:53] that must receive faith
[1:41:56] you've got to get rid of the doubt so
[1:41:57] that mustard seed faith can begin to
[1:41:59] grow and grow
[1:42:00] and grow as it multiplies spiritually as
[1:42:02] it begins to multiply
[1:42:03] through the grace of god in your life
[1:42:05] what happens spiritual multiplication
[1:42:07] when spiritual multiplication takes
[1:42:09] place you begin to look more like him
[1:42:12] because it won't be see the gene sees
[1:42:14] it's inside of you it's not a dog or a
[1:42:17] rabbit or even a human but it's god
[1:42:20] that is easy god's been a part of it
[1:42:22] it's a part of himself there's a gene
[1:42:24] seed inside you what's it going to make
[1:42:26] it's going to be more of god more of god
[1:42:28] more of god every cell that it feels
[1:42:30] there's gonna be more god
[1:42:32] don't you realize that's what he's doing
[1:42:34] today and when you when he gets done
[1:42:36] working in our lives sister fish we
[1:42:38] realize
[1:42:39] that it was him that dead
[1:42:46] oh now look grace and faith and
[1:42:49] multiplying together
[1:42:51] brother brown talked about how faith in
[1:42:54] jesus
[1:42:55] jesus five faith f-a-i-t-h-5
[1:42:59] he said david took five stones
[1:43:04] he said he he picked up five stones
[1:43:06] fifty i-th
[1:43:07] he put him in his finger five fingers
[1:43:11] faith in christ he took those stones and
[1:43:14] defeated a giant
[1:43:16] but those that stoned become a forced
[1:43:17] multiplier
[1:43:19] why because grace and faith were
[1:43:21] multiplying together listen
[1:43:25] when they begin to be negative about
[1:43:26] what god was doing
[1:43:28] all the negativity did was speed up the
[1:43:31] work
[1:43:33] are you with me if it hadn't been for
[1:43:36] tobias
[1:43:44] but the reason why they did it in 52
[1:43:46] days is because there were people who
[1:43:49] said it couldn't be done
[1:43:50] the reason why they did it as fast as
[1:43:52] they get is because there were people
[1:43:54] out there that wanted to kill
[1:43:55] there was an enemy out there that wanted
[1:43:57] to come in on them so they did it with
[1:43:58] one handed in 52 days
[1:44:02] are you it for now all the negativity
[1:44:05] that the world can bring on you today
[1:44:06] all it will do is speed up the work
[1:44:09] because god's people will be restored
[1:44:12] and have been restored back when it
[1:44:14] comes to the word
[1:44:15] they happen to be thrown after their
[1:44:16] headstone coming and we've had a message
[1:44:18] come that says grace
[1:44:20] amen grace into it
[1:44:25] i know it's a little different today
[1:44:29] that can be a positive or a negative it
[1:44:30] just depends on how you look at it
[1:44:34] i wonder if in our hearts we could just
[1:44:36] begin to talk to him and say lord
[1:44:39] help me to have that attitude that you
[1:44:43] can
[1:44:43] restore that you will restore help me to
[1:44:49] let that faith and grace be multiplied
[1:44:51] in my life
[1:44:52] you see negativity multiplies to
[1:44:55] all it takes is a mustard seed of faith
[1:44:59] mustard seed of faith and when that
[1:45:00] mustard seed is there
[1:45:02] we can grow to what god wants it to be
[1:45:05] let's just talk to him for a moment
[1:45:06] heavenly father we thank you for this
[1:45:08] church
[1:45:10] thank you for these people lord that
[1:45:11] have been so patient this morning with
[1:45:13] me and
[1:45:14] trying to get things set up the way we
[1:45:15] wanted
[1:45:17] god we we love you today and
[1:45:22] we're so thankful that we are not bound
[1:45:24] to our own potential
[1:45:28] lord in my own potential i'm just a
[1:45:31] clumsy overweight
[1:45:33] kind of guy i get to look at too much of
[1:45:35] that
[1:45:36] i get in trouble lord if i can just look
[1:45:41] at your problems
[1:45:43] there's something more than what i'm
[1:45:45] made of lord
[1:45:46] there's that seed that you put on the
[1:45:48] inside if i can just
[1:45:50] let your faith grace work in my life
[1:45:53] it's not what i can do but whatever
[1:45:56] effort i put forth lord
[1:45:58] are you multiplying god i know if i'm in
[1:46:00] your will and
[1:46:01] follow your word that you're multiplied
[1:46:03] you'll you'll produce it
[1:46:06] lord as mary and marc just stood at the
[1:46:08] tomb of lazarus
[1:46:09] they couldn't bring him alive nothing
[1:46:12] they could do
[1:46:13] but just wrote it in the stone but
[1:46:16] somebody had to roll with the stone
[1:46:18] maybe that'd be so in our lives today
[1:46:21] maybe
[1:46:21] if every effort that we put forth every
[1:46:23] action that we take may not do it
[1:46:24] lightly lord
[1:46:26] may we recognize that you'll multiply it
[1:46:28] you'll bless it
[1:46:29] be like the loaves and the fishes there
[1:46:31] may only be a few to start with
[1:46:34] but if you're in it you'll multiply it
[1:46:36] you'll produce something out of it
[1:46:38] thank you for that revelation today lord
[1:46:40] i pray that you make it real to each one
[1:46:43] of our lives
[1:46:44] thank you for the message that has come
[1:46:46] that was not a message of words but a
[1:46:47] message of grace
[1:46:49] thank you for your love this morning in
