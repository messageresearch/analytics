[0:00] go back just like all them other spies
[0:02] did it went over to look at at Canaan
[0:04] they come over there and said oh we look
[0:05] like gr harpper side them we can't take
[0:07] them the amalekites all these what
[0:09] they're going to do and they went back
[0:10] and Caleb and Joshua being th breads
[0:13] amen by the word of God no God said I
[0:15] give you that man they said we're more
[0:18] than able to take
[0:20] it depends on where you're born from if
[0:23] you're born to the word of God God's
[0:25] word has a prence is in his church
[0:28] that's what he died for that's his
[0:29] purpose that he might be able to achieve
[0:31] to have his prous working in his
[0:34] church let the word of God shine forth
[0:37] first no matter what anything else looks
[0:39] like I don't care if the intellectual
[0:40] says this that has nothing to do with it
[0:43] God's word said so and we're more than
[0:45] able to take it if I preach that my
[0:47] church and Minister told me said I'd be
[0:49] preaching to four post in the church I
[0:50] said I'd preach
[0:52] that God's word said so we can do it God
[0:56] said do
[0:58] it amen amen
[1:00] oh yeah they excuse themselves for this
[1:03] that's why they're blind to the message
[1:06] of the end
[1:08] time this last days when God is proving
[1:11] himself they try to class it as some
[1:14] kind of a
[1:16] spiritist or some uh uh oh what would I
[1:20] call it some mental
[1:23] illusion or something on that order see
[1:27] they they try to make it something that
[1:29] it isn't just like they did when he was
[1:30] here when Jesus was here they called him
[1:32] be ELO a fortune teller now they say
[1:35] it's kind of like a mental telepathy
[1:38] thing when they know that he can stand
[1:40] there and look upon the people and
[1:41] discern the very thoughts of in their
[1:43] heart the Bible said so well does not
[1:45] Hebrews the 4th chapter says the word of
[1:48] God is quicker and sharper than a two-
[1:49] AG Sword and conern the Very thoughts of
[1:50] the mind and he was that word and when
[1:53] that word is prence in the man the same
[1:56] thing takes place again or it is the
[1:58] word
[2:02] amen see how you can stumble over this
[2:04] from they're so perfectly plain see all
[2:08] right that's why they're blind same as
[2:10] it was in the days chrisis on earth oh
[2:12] my they stagger the same way they said
[2:15] he's bills they seen he could do it so
[2:18] they said he's just a he was born to the
[2:19] legitimate child kind of odd fell he
[2:21] just got possessed by some devil he he's
[2:24] a Samaritan over there and he's got a
[2:25] Devil in him that's how he does that
[2:27] Jesus said I'll forgive you for that see
[2:30] calling the word of God the works of God
[2:32] an evil spirit he said I forgive you for
[2:34] that but someday the Holy Ghost will
[2:36] come one word against it will never be
[2:39] forgiven neither in this world or the
[2:40] world that is to come or that great day
[2:42] it will not be forgiven so you see
[2:45] that's written plain in the scripture so
[2:47] when people come to that day no matter
[2:49] how intellectual how biger denomination
[2:50] they belong to it's condemned they have
[2:53] to be they blasphemed the Holy Ghost
[2:56] calling it Holy Roller and something
[2:58] that had an un tasty name or something
[3:01] like that and God's church had to Bear
[3:02] it all the time even Paul before gria
[3:05] said in the way that's called heresy
[3:07] which means crazy that's the way I
[3:09] worship the god that great intellectual
[3:11] scholar had to come to that place in a
[3:13] way that's called heresy why it was
[3:15] revealed to him that Pillar of Fire
[3:17] hanging before him said I'm Jesus the
[3:19] great God that was in the wilderness sh
[3:21] with Moses I am he it is hard for you to
[3:24] kick against the when Paul stand know
[3:27] that the life was laying at stake he
[3:29] said the way it is called heresy that's
[3:31] the way I worship the god of our father
[3:33] it was called that because it was
[3:34] revealed to him what the great truth of
[3:37] Christ was and today people say it's a
[3:40] denomination it's Jesus Christ the new
[3:42] birth revealed in you and he has the
[3:45] premes that he might Express his words
[3:47] and anything that he's promised in this
[3:48] last days he can bring it to pass to his
[3:50] body as he's working amen it's just
[3:53] exactly the word of God made manifest
[3:56] notice all right same as in the days of
[3:59] Christ god holds the key to this
[4:01] revelation of Christ
[4:04] himself you believe that schools of
[4:07] theology can never find it Jesus said so
[4:10] if you want to read it now in St Matthew
[4:12] 11:25 and
[4:14] 27 I think the old father God Of Heaven
[4:17] that thou hid this from the eyes of wise
[4:18] and prudent reveal it to Bab such as
[4:20] would learn see see I don't care look at
[4:24] them Scholars of that day those Jews
[4:28] very fine man they're organizations of
[4:31] Pharisees Sadducees and herodians and
[4:33] whatever they might be see all the great
[4:35] organizations and Jesus said you're a
[4:37] blind you lead the
[4:40] blind well did Isaiah speak of you you
[4:42] have ears and can't hear and eyes that
[4:44] you can't see because Isaiah said this
[4:47] in the spirit therefore the god of
[4:49] Heaven has blinded your eyes you're
[4:52] doing like Eve did accepting the
[4:53] intellectual side and know nothing of
[4:55] the spirit of God therefore won't they
[4:58] all fall in the ditch
[5:00] both the leader and the blind too the
[5:02] leader will fall with the blind because
[5:04] he's blind also the leader fall as blind
[5:08] leading the blind they both fall in the
[5:09] ditch and God Alone holds this
[5:13] key he expressed the same thing in a
[5:15] previous scriptures a while ago when I
[5:17] read it when he said who does man say I
[5:19] the son of man am and Peter said Thou
[5:22] Art the Christ the son of the Living God
[5:23] he said blessed art thou Simon son of
[5:26] Jonas Flesh and Blood never revealed
[5:29] this to you
[5:30] My Father which is in heaven upon this
[5:32] Revelation here alone I'll build my
[5:35] church The Gates of Hell will never
[5:37] Prevail against it see now you see so
[5:39] therefore there's no school no
[5:41] theologians no teachings of the Bible
[5:43] among any school that knows anything
[5:45] about it they cannot know nothing about
[5:47] it it's impossible for them to know
[5:48] anything about it God has hid the senses
[5:50] of noia from the very elected teachers
[5:53] and everything else it's a personal
[5:55] individual affair with the person that
[5:57] Christ has revealed to them and if you
[5:59] say he's been revealed to me and then
[6:00] the life that Christ produced here in
[6:02] the Bible that same life as in him does
[6:05] not produce itself in you then you've
[6:06] got the wrong
[6:08] Revelation if I put a life of a pumpkin
[6:11] into the life of a pear tree it would
[6:13] bear pumpkins by their fruits you shall
[6:16] know them exactly right if the the first
[6:20] you put out a tree a grape vine and it
[6:22] put out a bunch of grapes the first
[6:23] shoot it put out brought grapes the next
[6:25] brought out lemons the next it brought
[6:27] out pears the next brought out apples
[6:29] there's some kind of a grafted aair in
[6:31] there it's bearing its own life every
[6:33] denomination will bear life of itself
[6:35] but if that original vine ever puts out
[6:37] another uh uh Shute it'll bear grapes
[6:40] like it did the first time and if the
[6:42] life the life of Jesus Christ ever puts
[6:45] out another body of Believers it'll bear
[6:47] the fruit that the first one did they'll
[6:49] write a book of Acts behind it because
[6:51] it'll be the same same life praise God
[6:55] see what I mean you just can't get away
[6:57] from it it's the Life of Christ in you
[6:59] been injected In You by the Holy Spirit
[7:01] itself living its life through you blind
[7:04] leaders of the blind notice god holds
[7:06] this key alone no Theologian can tell
[7:10] you it's not known it's hid from them
[7:12] they know nothing about it so the
[7:14] schools when you say I got a pH lld D
[7:16] you only make you to me I believe to God
[7:19] and to any real True Believer that means
[7:21] you're just that much farther away
[7:23] you're just back on God is not knowing
[7:25] about education he's not knowing about
[7:27] how to explain it God is KNN about
[7:29] simplicity and a revelation of Jesus
[7:31] Christ to the most illiterate
[7:33] person see not your theology it's a
[7:36] revelation of Jesus Christ Upon This
[7:38] Rock I'll build my church no other rocks
[7:41] accepted no other things accepted no
[7:43] other Roman Rock no other Protestant
[7:45] Rock no other school no other nothing
[7:47] but exactly the revelation of Jesus
[7:50] Christ to the New Birth he borns there
[7:53] and he injects his own life and your
[7:54] life is gone and the life of Christ is
[7:56] projecting itself through you with the
[7:58] pinces to the people that they see the
[8:00] very life and works and signs and
[8:02] wonders that he did is doing the same
[8:04] thing through you outside of that the
[8:06] rest of us not even call to it
[8:09] all Watch God's Great Revelation
[8:13] unfolding by lack of this Revelation is
[8:16] why we have so many different divisions
[8:20] among us and so much mockery so much uh
[8:23] division Among Us is because the people
[8:25] lack that
[8:28] revelation
[8:30] [Music]

[15:25] offer the victory without fighting but
[15:29] he said help would always come in

[42:04] tonight and we'll go back into our uh
[42:07] study on Christ is the mystery of God
[42:09] revealed Hebrews 1 and one we'll read
[42:12] down through verse
[42:18] four remember brother Daryl Ward will be
[42:20] at Christian Tabernacle Saturday night
[42:23] at 7 if you want to go to that we'll
[42:25] have our services here on Sunday regular
[42:28] Services as well Hebrews 1:1 God who at
[42:32] sunry times and in diverse manners spake
[42:36] in time past unto the fathers by the
[42:39] prophets hath in these last days spoken
[42:42] unto us by his son whom Heath appointed
[42:46] heir of All Things by whom also he made
[42:49] the worlds who being the brightness of
[42:52] his glory and the express image of his
[42:54] person and upholding all things someone
[42:57] say all things by the word of his power
[43:00] oh I love that upholding All Things by
[43:03] the word of his power when he had by
[43:05] himself purged our sins sat down on the
[43:08] right hand of the Majesty on high being
[43:11] made so much better than the angels as
[43:14] he ha by inheritance obtained a more
[43:17] excellent Name than they amen aren't you
[43:20] glad that he did Hallelujah he's so much
[43:23] better than the angel let's just stop
[43:25] there pray the Lord add his Blessing to
[43:26] the word you may be
[43:32] seated got a lot on my mind tonight and
[43:34] and you just bear with me I'll try not
[43:36] to feed all of the hay
[43:39] to to those sheep that have showed up
[43:42] but we sure appreciate you being here
[43:45] tonight all of the Old Testament
[43:48] prophets were God unfolding
[43:52] himself revealing himself partially
[43:55] until he could be fully
[43:57] expressed in Christ so it it's very
[44:01] simple God unfolded himself a little bit
[44:04] like if I would take a handkerchief and
[44:06] and it's folded and you can't see what
[44:09] is on it if this was a picture you
[44:11] couldn't see the whole picture but it's
[44:14] folded up and God was folded in himself
[44:18] so he unfolds himself he declares
[44:23] himself through the prophets and as he's
[44:25] doing that he he uh he unfolds himself a
[44:28] little bit maybe through through Adam
[44:31] and and through Jacob and through
[44:33] Abraham and through the prophets he
[44:35] unfolds himself a little bit you can see
[44:37] so much of him he unfolds himself a
[44:40] little more in Moses you can see a
[44:42] little bit more of him and after a while
[44:44] he unfolds himself maybe in Elijah and
[44:47] the other prophets you can see a a
[44:49] little bit more of him but he does not
[44:52] unfold himself fully in any prophit but
[44:55] he unfolds himself fully in Christ right
[44:59] so you see the whole picture of
[45:02] redemption in Christ aren't you glad for
[45:04] that today so that's what brother BR
[45:06] means by God unfolding himself it's the
[45:09] simplest way I know to put it he unfolds
[45:11] himself he he actually declares and
[45:14] shows more and more of himself I think
[45:17] of in the Song of Solomon it talks about
[45:20] uh how that the uh the one would be
[45:23] standing there that uh Solomon would be
[45:25] standing there showing himself the king
[45:28] declaring himself to his bride and
[45:31] trying to get to where she could see him
[45:34] and and it was time it was Springtime
[45:37] Springtime is time for weddings and it's
[45:39] a time for love and and during the
[45:42] springtime the the bride Was preparing
[45:45] herself and getting herself ready and
[45:48] here he was trying to show himself the
[45:50] Bible say my beloved is like a row or a
[45:52] young heart behold he standeth behind
[45:54] our wall he lookth for at the windows
[45:58] showing himself through the lattice but
[46:01] when Christ came he was fully shown to
[46:05] us of what God really was we see
[46:07] glimpses of him like like through a
[46:09] lattice like through a window we saw
[46:12] glimpses of him in the prophets we see
[46:15] glimpses of him in uh even in the the
[46:18] the women of the Bible even in uh even
[46:20] in the uh even in all the Old Testament
[46:23] brother Brandon said in every scripture
[46:25] we see glimpses of Christ but now we see
[46:28] the fullness of Christ and we know then
[46:31] that he would also unfold himself in
[46:33] this age and reveal himself in this age
[46:35] that down through denominational history
[46:38] he would show so much of his word so
[46:40] much of his word but finally in this age
[46:43] we now have the unfolding of God the
[46:46] fullness of God we're able to see who he
[46:49] really
[46:50] is so he reveals himself fully through
[46:53] the word now brother brandom says notice
[46:56] now down Through the Ages he has been
[46:57] gradually letting this out slowly
[47:00] unfolding the mystery through the
[47:03] prophets and through the
[47:05] types so now brother Brand's going to
[47:08] deal with three of those prophets in the
[47:11] Old Testament he's going to deal with
[47:12] mosus Joseph and David we know that
[47:16] Jesus is a prophet he's a priest and
[47:20] he's a king how many know that tonight
[47:22] he's a prophet priest and King and so
[47:25] brother bram's going to use example of
[47:27] Moses the lawgiver Joseph the
[47:30] intercessor David the king he's going to
[47:33] show us Prophet priest and King in the
[47:36] unfolding in the Old Testament so first
[47:39] of all he goes to Moses he said he
[47:41] expressed himself in Moses look at Moses
[47:43] born in the time of persecution of the
[47:45] children he was born to be a deliverer
[47:48] he was hid in the bull rushes just like
[47:50] Jesus was taken down into Egypt Jesus
[47:52] went up to the mountain he said his
[47:55] first sermon sermon on the the mount
[47:57] come back down with the commandments so
[47:59] just like Moses goes up in the mountain
[48:02] comes back down with the Commandments
[48:04] but they're a little different aren't
[48:05] they and I want to look at that tonight
[48:07] for just a moment they're a little bit
[48:09] different and he said you heard them say
[48:10] them of Old Times thou shal not commit
[48:12] adultery I say to you whoever looks upon
[48:14] a woman lust after her hath committed
[48:16] adultery he said he's lawgiver priest
[48:19] king leader amen just exactly so let's
[48:24] let's do that tonight just for a little
[48:25] bit of Bible study we could Matthew 5
[48:28] and verse
[48:30] 17 we'll compare with that with Exodus
[48:33] 20 I won't go through all of these but
[48:35] just a couple to show you what he's
[48:37] talking about tonight so we we see the
[48:40] partial in the partial unfolding we find
[48:43] that he he says certain things but in
[48:46] the fullness he says other things he he
[48:48] he he expresses himself more fully what
[48:52] his thought was he doesn't change it but
[48:55] he fulfills it
[48:57] Matthew 5:17 think not that I'm come to
[48:59] destroy the law or the prophets I'm not
[49:02] come to destroy but to fulfill for
[49:04] verily I say unto you till Heaven and
[49:06] Earth pass one jot or one tit that's one
[49:10] uh
[49:11] punctuation right that's like an
[49:12] apostrophe or or a period not or a
[49:16] common not one jot or one tit shall in
[49:19] no wise pass from the law till all
[49:22] someone say all all be
[49:25] fulfilled he said said verse 19
[49:27] whosoever therefore shall break one of
[49:29] these least Commandments and shall teach
[49:31] men so he shall be called the least in
[49:34] the Kingdom of Heaven but whosoever
[49:36] shall do and teach them the same Shall
[49:38] be Called great in the Kingdom of Heaven
[49:42] so now he's teaching them that we don't
[49:44] do away with the law it don't mean there
[49:46] are no rules Grace doesn't mean there's
[49:47] no rules but what does he do he come to
[49:50] fulfill the law to manifest the law
[49:54] right not just to be a ceremony or or
[49:56] deadly letter but to be
[49:58] alive so he says now he said I say unto
[50:02] you except your righteousness shall
[50:04] exceed the righteousness of the scribes
[50:06] and Pharisees you shall in no wise in no
[50:08] case enter into the kingdom of
[50:10] heaven now if you go to Exodus 2013 one
[50:13] of the Ten Commandments is Thou shalt
[50:16] not
[50:17] kill right actually in in the original
[50:19] Thou shalt not
[50:20] murder Thou shalt not
[50:23] murder right now Matthew 5:21
[50:28] says you have heard it was said by them
[50:29] of old time Thou shalt not kill well
[50:33] them of old time was
[50:35] Moses right now and they added a
[50:37] tradition to that and there was some uh
[50:39] and actually in Leviticus Moses even
[50:41] adds some to it but he said thou if thou
[50:44] shallal not kill whosoever shall kill
[50:46] shall be in danger of the
[50:47] Judgment verse 22 but I say unto you
[50:51] that whosoever is angry with his brother
[50:54] Without a
[50:55] Cause
[50:57] huh just because he woke up in a bad
[50:59] mood
[51:01] say right whosoever shall say to his
[51:04] brother it shall be in danger of the
[51:06] Judgment but whosoever whosoever shall
[51:08] say to his brother rqa shall it be in
[51:10] danger of the counsel but whosoever
[51:14] shall say thou fool shall be in danger
[51:16] of
[51:17] Hellfire that's pretty harsh isn't it
[51:20] then what Jesus I thought you had more
[51:21] grace he does he does have more grace he
[51:24] gives us the ability he gives he put the
[51:27] spirit in us because nobody can live the
[51:29] law because you might have got angry
[51:31] with your brother or more likely your
[51:33] wife or your husband
[51:36] today right you might have said
[51:38] something you shouldn't have said today
[51:40] but he's ever interceding for us he's
[51:43] not just a prophet he's also a priest
[51:46] and he's also a king amen we need to
[51:49] remember that
[51:50] now he said therefore thou bring thy
[51:52] gift to The Altar and they rememb thy
[51:54] brother hath ought against thee see how
[51:56] he's he's he's making the picture larger
[51:59] where we can see what he meant by Thou
[52:01] shalt not kill now we never got all that
[52:03] out of Thou shalt not kill but Jesus the
[52:06] word said it's more than just taking a
[52:09] knife and stabbing somebody but it's
[52:12] actually how you treat one
[52:14] another right so he said leave there thy
[52:18] gift before the altar go thy way first
[52:19] be reconciled to thy brother and then
[52:21] come and offer thy gift verse 25 agree
[52:25] with thine adversary quickly while thou
[52:27] are in the way with him lest at any time
[52:28] the adversary delivered thee to the
[52:30] judge and the judge delivered thee to
[52:32] the officer and thou be cast into prison
[52:34] verely I say unto thee Thou shalt by no
[52:36] means come out then till th pay the
[52:38] uttermost Farthing now he's going to
[52:39] deal with another one Exodus 2014 says
[52:43] Thou shalt not commit
[52:45] adultery that's pretty straightforward
[52:47] isn't it Thou shalt not commit adultery
[52:50] Matthew
[52:52] 5:27 youve heard that it was said by
[52:54] them of old time Thou shalt not Comm
[52:56] adultery but I say unto you whosoever
[52:59] lookth on a woman to lust after her ha
[53:01] committed adultery with her already in
[53:05] his
[53:06] heart and if and now again that's pretty
[53:10] strong thank God for the
[53:12] blood but that's why brother brandom
[53:14] tells us the Holy Ghost filled man will
[53:16] turn his head because he doesn't want to
[53:19] he doesn't want to cross that there's
[53:20] something in him wants to do right right
[53:24] but yet you're a human being and so you
[53:25] have to have
[53:27] you have to have an advocate even the
[53:29] best Christian in the world now and now
[53:31] watch what Jesus says he keeps going on
[53:33] further he said If thy right eye offend
[53:36] thee pluck it out and cast it from thee
[53:38] for it is profitable for thee that one
[53:40] of thy members should perish not that
[53:42] thy whole body should be cast into hell
[53:44] now he puts it he puts it into a place
[53:47] where adultery begins with a
[53:50] thought right so if we're going to if
[53:53] we're going to take care of the sin
[53:55] let's take care of where it's started at
[53:58] right not just say adultery was wrong
[54:00] but even the thought of it is wrong so
[54:03] now he said If thy right hand offend
[54:05] thee cut it off and cast it from thee it
[54:07] is profitable for thee that one of thy
[54:09] members should perish not that thy whole
[54:10] body should be cast into hell now what's
[54:12] he saying do take the extreme measure
[54:15] that you need to take make sure your
[54:17] heart's right before God I say Amen to
[54:20] that today
[54:21] now so again he said it been said it has
[54:25] been said right he's going to take a
[54:27] little bit further on adultery he said
[54:29] whosoever shall put away his wife let
[54:30] him give her a writing of divorcement
[54:33] but I say unto you whosoever shall put
[54:34] away his wife saving for the cause of
[54:36] fornication causeth her to commit
[54:38] adultery the B said that's because she
[54:40] would get married
[54:41] again and whosoever shall marry her that
[54:43] is divorced committed committeth
[54:46] adultery there was no restrictions on
[54:48] divorce in the Old Testament in that way
[54:51] but Jesus said there was he come down
[54:54] the mountain and fulfilled the law he
[54:57] come down with Ten Commandments if we
[54:59] can say it that way with the Fulfillment
[55:01] of that with what God had in his mind
[55:04] about the Ten Commandment can I can I go
[55:06] a little bit further I think we
[55:08] understand and we're mature enough to
[55:09] understand what happened in our day was
[55:12] God was revealing himself in his
[55:14] fullness to the church and showing us
[55:17] what these things were to the church and
[55:20] so that's one reason why marriage and
[55:21] divorce had to be preached brother
[55:23] bandam said he talks about in marriage
[55:25] and divorce he goes over all the things
[55:27] that went on and he goes over all the uh
[55:29] all the things the way it was a man can
[55:31] a woman can't and one man and and many
[55:34] one or one deer and many uh many female
[55:38] deer and one Buck many female deer and
[55:40] you look at that and some people look at
[55:41] that and say my it gives me a license to
[55:43] do whatever I want no it doesn't listen
[55:45] to this he said but now that the seals
[55:47] are open the spirit of Truth directs us
[55:51] to the word right that explains why all
[55:54] the mistakes has been made he told us
[55:57] polygamy was a
[55:59] mistake it explains why all the mistakes
[56:01] has been made down Through the Ages
[56:03] because the seals was not opened this
[56:06] was not revealed what's he doing I'm
[56:07] just using this as an illustration
[56:09] preaching on marriage and divorce
[56:10] tonight but it's just so we can
[56:12] understand what God's doing he's
[56:14] unfolding
[56:15] himself and I'll say this you know you I
[56:17] know people say well I feel bad because
[56:19] I've been divorced and and and I've been
[56:22] through that maybe married and divorced
[56:23] married again and divorced and I feel
[56:25] bad well the same Prophet that said that
[56:27] that said teach your children not to do
[56:29] it also said stay as you are God give
[56:32] you forgiveness I'm so glad for that and
[56:35] every one of us need
[56:38] forgiveness now so that was him
[56:41] unfolding himself in Moses he unfolded
[56:44] himself in Joseph Joseph the
[56:47] intercessor in Genesis 41:41 we find
[56:50] that Pharaoh said to Joseph see I have
[56:52] set thee over all the land of Egypt and
[56:55] Pharaoh took off his his ring from his
[56:57] hand and put it on Joseph's hand raid
[56:59] him in festures of fine linen put a gold
[57:02] chain about his neck he made him to ride
[57:04] in the second Chariot which he had and
[57:06] they cried before him bow the knee and
[57:09] he made him ruler over all the land of
[57:12] Egypt look at compare the New Testament
[57:14] John 14:6 Jesus said I am the way the
[57:17] truth and the life no man cometh unto
[57:19] the father by me what is it a direct
[57:21] type of Joseph was a direct type of
[57:24] Christ because no man could come to
[57:26] Pharaoh without
[57:27] Joseph 1 Timothy 2:5 there's one God and
[57:31] one mediator between God and Men the man
[57:33] Christ Jesus he is the only one in
[57:36] between aren't you glad of that tonight
[57:38] aren't you glad there's no one else
[57:39] between you and God it's just it's just
[57:42] you and God because there's one mediator
[57:45] and that's the man Christ Jesus and he's
[57:47] God so it's rigged for you as we said
[57:50] before now look Romans 14:11 it says as
[57:54] I live says the Lord every knees shall
[57:56] bow to me every tongue shall confess to
[57:59] God so what is he doing he we see a
[58:02] direct type of Joseph now brother B said
[58:04] he expressed himself in Joseph born
[58:06] amongst denomination his Brethren he
[58:08] said they hated him without a cause
[58:10] because he was spiritual he saw Visions
[58:12] God was with him he could interpret
[58:14] dreams and his brothers hated him he was
[58:16] sold by his breth by almost 30 pieces of
[58:18] silver just like he was sold by Judas
[58:20] the scariot by 30 pieces of silver he
[58:22] was thrown into a ditch and supposed to
[58:24] have been dead that's right the father
[58:26] and them was told he was dead he said
[58:28] that he strowed into this ditch taken up
[58:30] went to the right hand of pharaoh he
[58:32] said in the dungeon how he suffered
[58:33] there there was two saved the Butler and
[58:35] the baker one of them was lost the other
[58:37] was saved and it was their attitudes
[58:40] towards Joseph that really determine the
[58:42] outcome just as on the cross when he was
[58:44] in his prison house attacked to the
[58:46] cross for our sins become a prisoner one
[58:49] Thief was lost and one was saved both of
[58:52] them thieves both of them had done wrong
[58:54] but one got the king's favor and the
[58:56] other one didn't yeah right oh my oh we
[59:01] were just as guilty as the world is do
[59:03] do we understand that tonight church but
[59:05] we got his favor and others didn't
[59:08] why because it was given to us oh aren't
[59:11] you glad for the gift of his favor gift
[59:14] of his grace tonight he said then become
[59:16] cometh the right hand of pharaoh the
[59:17] king that he dreamed had the vision he
[59:20] would set excuse me at the king's feet
[59:23] and all authority in Egypt was given to
[59:24] him as Vision now listen had to come to
[59:29] pass brother Brandon says something here
[59:31] I think it's important CU he said he
[59:33] might have studied of it many times
[59:36] other words he might have sat there and
[59:38] thought I wonder how this could
[59:41] happen while he was in the
[59:43] prison right brother Bill must not have
[59:46] seemed like it could ever happen because
[59:48] he's studying about it he's thinking
[59:50] here I had this Vision I know that the
[59:52] vision is right I know God always showed
[59:55] me the vision was right but how could it
[59:57] ever happen I think we ought to we ought
[59:59] to think about these things tonight how
[1:00:01] could it ever take place how could we
[1:00:03] ever see ourselves making it how could
[1:00:06] we ever make a Rapture it's hard to see
[1:00:08] when you're in the prison but God's got
[1:00:10] a way out of the
[1:00:11] prison and while he was in the prison
[1:00:13] his whiskers growing out and so forth
[1:00:15] but he studied it oh it's a good thing
[1:00:18] to study the promise of God to study the
[1:00:20] visions of God and see what God did in
[1:00:23] our day and see what he's going to do
[1:00:26] amen because the word is still true how
[1:00:29] many believe that today this message is
[1:00:31] still going to come to pass he said
[1:00:32] though it linger it's got to happen he
[1:00:35] said as I spoke Wednesday night but here
[1:00:37] at the service see it has to happen when
[1:00:39] God says so it's got to happen it's a
[1:00:41] Vindicated prophit and it has to come to
[1:00:44] pass cuz it's God's word how many
[1:00:46] believe that tonight if it's God's word
[1:00:48] it's got to come to
[1:00:49] pass that's why we can be just as
[1:00:51] excited brother B say with the 25 cents
[1:00:53] as we can with the loaf of bread right
[1:00:56] cuz that 25 cents is is a down payment
[1:00:59] it's the price it's a purchase of the
[1:01:01] Lord and we have the price that it takes
[1:01:03] if you have the token tonight you have
[1:01:05] the price of going into
[1:01:07] Rapture you say well I have the Holy
[1:01:09] Ghost but I don't feel like it all the
[1:01:10] time he didn't say you would always feel
[1:01:12] like it but it is the token it is the
[1:01:15] price that it takes to make it in though
[1:01:18] it linger it's got to happen because
[1:01:21] it's God's word and brother B said and
[1:01:24] the word comes only to the prophet the
[1:01:26] word Prophet means a revealer of the
[1:01:27] Divine written word the same as it does
[1:01:29] a foreteller or Seer and the sear how
[1:01:32] the one you know is telling forthy is
[1:01:34] divinely Vindicated by foreseeing and it
[1:01:37] comes to pass if there be one who is
[1:01:39] Prophet will speak to you tell you
[1:01:40] certain things are going to happen if it
[1:01:42] don't happen he said don't listen to him
[1:01:45] but if it does happen I'm with him he
[1:01:47] said you better fear him because I'm
[1:01:49] with him you see that's exactly he said
[1:01:51] there is the Vindication there where
[1:01:54] there where you know where there's the
[1:01:55] truth
[1:01:56] or whether it isn't I believe we had a
[1:01:58] Vindicated prophet in our day and I
[1:02:00] believe he had something to say have you
[1:02:02] believe that he had something to say the
[1:02:05] Bible says that the vision is yet for an
[1:02:07] appointed time there there's a specific
[1:02:10] time that God has chosen for your
[1:02:12] healing there's a specific time an
[1:02:15] appointed time that God has chosen for
[1:02:17] the Salvation of your children there's a
[1:02:19] appointed time that God I don't know if
[1:02:21] anybody's going to have church with me
[1:02:22] tonight but I I just feel like having
[1:02:24] church for a minute there's an appoint
[1:02:25] OED time that God chose for the vision
[1:02:28] whatever is spoken over you to come to
[1:02:31] pass there is God knows the day the hour
[1:02:34] none of us know but there is an
[1:02:36] appointed time the vision is yet for an
[1:02:39] appointed time it will happen at the end
[1:02:42] it shall speak and not lie though it t
[1:02:46] wait for it wait for it Church listen
[1:02:49] what does the Bible say they that wait
[1:02:51] upon the Lord shall renew their strength
[1:02:54] they shall Mount up with wings like
[1:02:55] eagles they shall run and not be weary
[1:02:57] they shall walk and not faint what is it
[1:03:00] they they they're waiting we're waiting
[1:03:01] on the Lord he said because it was
[1:03:03] surely come it will not tar other words
[1:03:07] once its time is right it will not delay
[1:03:10] any
[1:03:11] further
[1:03:13] Hallelujah brother Brandon spoke of a
[1:03:15] bride that would not fall I just believe
[1:03:18] it'll
[1:03:19] happen he spoke of a restored church
[1:03:21] with signs wonders and miracles I
[1:03:23] believe there's an appointed time right
[1:03:26] for that to take place in our lives he
[1:03:28] said we could apply the token over our
[1:03:30] families did he say that then though it
[1:03:33] Terry wait for it it will surely come to
[1:03:36] pass I tell you what brother Billy saw
[1:03:38] us in our Heavenly home we we had in the
[1:03:42] vision God showed him in a vision what
[1:03:44] it was like over there and he saw he saw
[1:03:46] us there he saw the ones who were
[1:03:49] brought up under his ministry and when
[1:03:51] he saw his brother Herold though it
[1:03:52] carry wait for it it will come to pass
[1:03:56] you're not going to be in these old
[1:03:57] bodies the older I get the more sick I
[1:03:59] get of this body I want a new one I want
[1:04:02] one that works right I want one that
[1:04:04] doesn't hurt I want one that gives me
[1:04:07] the ability to travel like a thought
[1:04:09] that's what I was born
[1:04:11] for amen and I'm part of that Pride that
[1:04:14] won't fall I'm part of the vision right
[1:04:18] part of the ones he saw going up and not
[1:04:20] going down ohow it Terry wait for
[1:04:24] it it will surely come pass you say
[1:04:27] brother Ben I'm looking for peace in my
[1:04:28] home I'm looking for looking for Joy I'm
[1:04:30] looking for things to happen wait for
[1:04:33] it if the vision said it you can have it
[1:04:37] right if the vision said it you can you
[1:04:40] will have it but you got to wait for it
[1:04:44] you don't know how long Abraham waited
[1:04:45] 25 years but finally the promise
[1:04:47] came Amen brother BR said God is
[1:04:51] speaking back through his word to his
[1:04:54] people by by people I love this God is
[1:04:59] speaking back through his word to his
[1:05:02] people by people see he said God only
[1:05:06] speaks through man I am the vine you're
[1:05:08] the branches the vine doesn't bear fruit
[1:05:11] he said the branches
[1:05:14] talk oh I love that people say well we
[1:05:17] shouldn't be preaching in church well
[1:05:18] the branches
[1:05:21] talk the branches bear the fruit of the
[1:05:23] vine notice he said it's always been
[1:05:26] that way he wants somebody listen church
[1:05:30] I we we we want to listen to the message
[1:05:32] we want uh to listen to tapes it
[1:05:34] encourages me when I find you've been
[1:05:36] listening to the prophet that that
[1:05:37] encourages me when I hear I've watched
[1:05:40] something over time when somebody really
[1:05:42] begins to commit their life to the Lord
[1:05:44] and they begin to get right with God the
[1:05:46] one of the first things they do is start
[1:05:47] listening to a prophet I seen it over
[1:05:50] and over and over again and when people
[1:05:52] backside one of the first things they do
[1:05:54] is quit listening to a
[1:05:56] prophet and you can explain that any way
[1:05:59] you want to but it's just a fact I've
[1:06:00] seen it over and over and over and over
[1:06:02] again so I'm grateful that you listen
[1:06:04] but he wants somebody who not only
[1:06:05] listens to it but will speak
[1:06:08] it God speaking to his people by
[1:06:13] people
[1:06:14] amen now brother bandam talk again
[1:06:18] continuing to talk about Joseph this all
[1:06:20] in Christ is to mystery he said now we
[1:06:22] find Joseph then when no man could touch
[1:06:24] or come to pharaoh without first seeing
[1:06:26] Joseph no man can come to the father
[1:06:28] only by the son and when Joseph left the
[1:06:30] throne they sounded trumpets every knee
[1:06:32] bowed Joseph is coming forth Glory he
[1:06:35] said someday every knee will bow every
[1:06:38] tongue will confess when he leads the
[1:06:39] Throne of his father to come forth he
[1:06:42] said everybody will bear witness he is
[1:06:44] the Son of God he said it's too late
[1:06:47] then do it
[1:06:48] now right CU you're going to Bow one day
[1:06:50] right might as well bow to him
[1:06:54] now so his first type was Moses the
[1:06:57] second that he used was was Joseph his
[1:07:01] third who was an intercessor with his
[1:07:03] with his family for his brothers he when
[1:07:07] his brothers come up there he the
[1:07:09] intercessor between them and Pharaoh was
[1:07:11] they were in his hands he could have
[1:07:13] killed them but he didn't do it why
[1:07:16] because he said this happened to save
[1:07:18] life I want you to watch that Joseph
[1:07:22] humbling himself to the vision of God
[1:07:25] that the the vision of God is greater
[1:07:27] than what I feel and my desire for
[1:07:30] Retribution and my desire for
[1:07:33] Revenge right so that's an important
[1:07:35] Point as we go on now brother Brandon
[1:07:37] says now we notice that through the
[1:07:38] types we could take even David as I
[1:07:41] spoke of a while ago going off his
[1:07:42] throne rejected by his own people he he
[1:07:45] said going up the same Mountain Mount of
[1:07:47] all is as he's going over to his prison
[1:07:51] he was going to his prison house because
[1:07:54] he was rejected of his brother
[1:07:56] and of his own people he went up weeping
[1:07:59] he said that was the spirit of Christ in
[1:08:01] him to be
[1:08:05] rejected you think well if I had the
[1:08:07] spirit of Christ I'd i' I'd jump and
[1:08:10] shout and praise God and worship yes you
[1:08:12] would that's part of it but you might
[1:08:15] also be
[1:08:17] rejected right and
[1:08:19] weep because he
[1:08:22] did right he rejected don't don't sell
[1:08:25] yourself
[1:08:25] short because many times we don't
[1:08:28] feel oh church we we don't feel like
[1:08:32] we're saved and if listen if I was only
[1:08:34] saved when I felt like I was saved I'd
[1:08:37] have been saved about one tenth of my
[1:08:40] life we're not saved because we feel
[1:08:43] like it we're saved because we know we
[1:08:45] are according to the word we did what
[1:08:48] God required and we were called to him
[1:08:50] and he did a supernatural work we
[1:08:52] couldn't have done that to ourselves he
[1:08:54] did that we couldn't have called
[1:08:56] ourselves we could there's so many
[1:08:58] stories here in our church that we could
[1:08:59] say they couldn't have called themselves
[1:09:01] none of you could he had to do that you
[1:09:04] came in spite of all this nonsense you
[1:09:07] came oh God you came in spite of what
[1:09:09] other people were doing in the message
[1:09:11] you came in spite of what other people
[1:09:12] were doing in your family you loved God
[1:09:15] anyway but you didn't always feel saved
[1:09:18] I don't always feel saved sometimes you
[1:09:20] feel like weeping but that may be an
[1:09:21] expression of Christ in your
[1:09:24] life
[1:09:26] 800 years later the son of David stood
[1:09:28] on Jerusalem up there above Jerusalem
[1:09:29] and rejected wept over Jerusalem and
[1:09:32] said now your hour has come he was a
[1:09:36] rejected King and he still is today oh
[1:09:39] but I want to be one that stands with
[1:09:41] him don't you want to be one that stands
[1:09:43] with
[1:09:44] him Hallelujah like those like those
[1:09:47] that that run down into The Well of
[1:09:50] Bethlehem got him a drink of water I
[1:09:51] want to be somebody who's willing to get
[1:09:53] him a drink of Pentecostal
[1:09:56] water amen I want to be somebody who
[1:09:59] worships him when I don't feel like
[1:10:01] it at the beginning of Christ is the
[1:10:04] mystery of God revealed can we I I I've
[1:10:06] been I'm going I'm doing real good so we
[1:10:08] got a few more minutes but at the
[1:10:11] beginning I mean I'm doing real good on
[1:10:13] time you can
[1:10:15] judge
[1:10:20] content at the beginning of chrisis the
[1:10:22] mystery of God revealed brother brandham
[1:10:24] deals with a story he tells a story
[1:10:26] about Lee Vil and I cut it out I'll be
[1:10:28] honest with you I I took it out because
[1:10:30] brother BR was just talking and so I
[1:10:32] didn't think anym about it and I didn't
[1:10:34] include that in our study of Christ is
[1:10:36] the mystery because brother Bron then
[1:10:38] does a baby dedication some other things
[1:10:40] then he he begins preaching so I didn't
[1:10:42] include that in our study but I want to
[1:10:45] go back to it now and brother brandom
[1:10:48] said brother Veil is one of the finest
[1:10:49] man I ever knew but he's just a little
[1:10:51] too quick on the
[1:10:53] trigger and I've never really understood
[1:10:55] where this comment fit into Christ's the
[1:10:59] mystery of God revealed into the body of
[1:11:00] the sermon till
[1:11:01] now because he's talking about God
[1:11:03] unfolding himself in
[1:11:05] David and so he said he's just a little
[1:11:07] too quick on the trigger he said I
[1:11:09] always told him you know and he said I
[1:11:11] hope that's all right brother Veil I
[1:11:12] said brother veil was sitting there he
[1:11:14] said don't fly loose all at once sit
[1:11:16] still God is the one that's doing
[1:11:19] it God is the one that's doing
[1:11:23] it right and brother Veil got upset cuz
[1:11:26] everybody's rejecting the message and
[1:11:27] everybody's the veil's about there ready
[1:11:28] to fight if you ever met Lee Vil or what
[1:11:31] I'm told about him that that that's the
[1:11:33] way he was he's going on to his reward
[1:11:35] now but he was a fighter but brother
[1:11:38] Brandon said sit still God is the one
[1:11:40] that's doing it and in doing that he
[1:11:43] told him the story about David from 2
[1:11:47] Samuel this Story 2 Samuel 16:5 when
[1:11:49] King David came to baham behold then
[1:11:52] came out a man of the family in the
[1:11:53] house of Saul who name was shemi the son
[1:11:57] of GE he came forth and cursed still as
[1:12:00] he came it's amazing who all shows up
[1:12:02] when it looks like you're down and out
[1:12:05] right you know people just pile on right
[1:12:08] when it looks like you're down and out
[1:12:10] then here all come all the shemas out of
[1:12:12] the woodwor he never said nothing as
[1:12:14] long as David was in his throne but when
[1:12:16] David's a rejected King going up the
[1:12:18] hill weeping here comes shemiah to throw
[1:12:21] some rocks at him and curse him and he
[1:12:24] cast at David and that all the Servants
[1:12:26] of King David and all the people and all
[1:12:28] the mighty men were on his right hand on
[1:12:30] his left we're go down to verse
[1:12:32] n and abashi the son of Zariah who was
[1:12:36] one of David's Mighty Men He said why
[1:12:37] should this dead dog curse my Lord the
[1:12:40] King right let me go over I pray thee
[1:12:42] and take off his
[1:12:47] head and if I had been David I'd have
[1:12:49] been real
[1:12:54] tempted cuz it was his head doing all
[1:12:56] the damage you know talking
[1:13:00] cursing maybe the Rocks didn't hurt too
[1:13:02] bad but it was the
[1:13:04] words listen and the King
[1:13:08] said listen what have I to do with you
[1:13:10] you sons of Zariah so let him
[1:13:13] curse because the Lord has said unto
[1:13:17] him curse
[1:13:20] David that's hard to wrap your mind
[1:13:23] around but see he had the to fulfill a
[1:13:26] type of Christ in his life but and in
[1:13:28] order to do that the Lord actually said
[1:13:32] oh God CH shemiah cursed David right we
[1:13:37] know God allows evil spirits to
[1:13:38] influence people so it's not God
[1:13:40] directly himself but we see the type of
[1:13:42] that Micaiah a lying Spirit come up
[1:13:44] before the Lord and said who will go and
[1:13:46] be a you know tell these prophets the
[1:13:48] wrong thing he said you go do it right
[1:13:51] God allows it so God allowed a cursing
[1:13:53] Spirit an evil Spirit to come on this
[1:13:56] shemiah to curse David and David said
[1:13:59] the Lord told him to do it who shall
[1:14:02] then say wherefore hast thou done
[1:14:05] so and David said to AB abashi and to
[1:14:08] all his servants behold my son which
[1:14:10] came forth out of my bowel seeks my life
[1:14:12] he said it just it's just really bad
[1:14:14] right now said my own son's seeking my
[1:14:16] life how much more now may this
[1:14:18] benjamite do it let him alone let him
[1:14:22] curse for the Lord ha bidden him
[1:14:27] now I know there's not going to be much
[1:14:29] dancing and shouting over that if you
[1:14:32] can think about your own life and think
[1:14:33] about some of the things that people say
[1:14:35] about you you said what it wasn't true
[1:14:38] neither was what he was saying about
[1:14:40] David David wasn't a bloodthirsty
[1:14:43] Tyrant but he that's the way he viewed
[1:14:45] him because he was one of the House of
[1:14:47] Saul right David wasn't a bloodthirsty
[1:14:50] Tyrant but but here shemiah thought he
[1:14:53] was now
[1:14:55] he said God has allowed this for a
[1:14:57] reason now later on that day after
[1:14:59] Brother brandham Talks to Lee Vil he
[1:15:01] said the tax collector called and I know
[1:15:05] it's getting close to tax season in fact
[1:15:06] I filed mine
[1:15:08] today but the payment don't go out till
[1:15:10] the
[1:15:12] 15th I'm not giving them my money a day
[1:15:16] early I feel really bad about that
[1:15:18] because there's so much we could do with
[1:15:20] that you know and I feel like CU I live
[1:15:22] off the ties of the people's the Lord's
[1:15:24] money so it aggravates Ates me it
[1:15:25] aggravated brother brother brandom the
[1:15:28] tax man he said they give him okay to
[1:15:30] write a check and and then as soon as
[1:15:32] they wrote it boy it hit the bank and
[1:15:33] here they come back after
[1:15:35] it and so and and he said everybody
[1:15:39] started to say well that old tax
[1:15:40] collector Tax Collector's easy to to to
[1:15:42] pick on isn't
[1:15:44] he that old tax collector and they're
[1:15:48] all talking about him and brother BR
[1:15:49] said not thinking of what IID told
[1:15:50] Brother Vil I said let him alone maybe
[1:15:54] the Lord told him to do
[1:15:57] that now watch God was trying to move
[1:15:59] brother brandom in a certain direction
[1:16:01] he said I know more than said that till
[1:16:03] a light flashed on the wall and rode
[1:16:05] across there brother Veil and my wife
[1:16:07] sitting there come on back to
[1:16:09] Arizona see we don't always know what
[1:16:11] God's doing God was trying to move
[1:16:13] brother Brandon make him a little bit
[1:16:15] uncomfortable because he'd come back to
[1:16:16] Jeffersonville and there was a few more
[1:16:18] things on the mountain that God wanted
[1:16:20] to show him his own healing was one of
[1:16:23] them right you can find that in in uh on
[1:16:26] the wings of a stat Dove he needed to
[1:16:28] show him some more things he had to show
[1:16:30] him the mystery of marriage and divorce
[1:16:31] he had to show him all these other
[1:16:33] things so he said come on back to
[1:16:34] Arizona so he used the tax collector to
[1:16:37] make brother brandom
[1:16:38] uncomfortable he said maybe the Lord
[1:16:40] told him to do it what was it the spirit
[1:16:43] of Christ in a
[1:16:45] prophet but I love the fact that one
[1:16:50] day even the
[1:16:52] persecutor will fall at the feet
[1:16:55] of Our
[1:16:57] Lord right it said all every knee shall
[1:17:01] bow is that right every
[1:17:03] knee and in 2 Samuel
[1:17:05] 19:18 it says there went over a ferry
[1:17:07] boat to carry over the king's household
[1:17:09] to do what he thought good now this is
[1:17:10] as and you just pardon me for a minute
[1:17:12] I'll be done in just a minute but he
[1:17:15] here is as they're going up they're
[1:17:16] going back into the city they've won the
[1:17:19] war and things look different when
[1:17:22] David's in
[1:17:23] power I'm looking forward to that day
[1:17:27] and they went over a ferry boat to do
[1:17:28] and car carry the king's household to do
[1:17:30] what he thought good and shemiah the son
[1:17:32] of Gir fell down before the king fell
[1:17:34] down before the king same guy on his way
[1:17:38] out of town he threw rocks at him spit
[1:17:41] on him made fun of him cursed him the
[1:17:45] same guy fell down before the king oh
[1:17:49] one day every knee shall
[1:17:51] bow as he was come over Jordan he said
[1:17:54] to the king let not my Lord impute
[1:17:56] iniquity unto me neither do thou
[1:17:58] remember that which thy servant did
[1:18:00] perversely the day that my Lord the king
[1:18:01] went out of Jerusalem that the king
[1:18:03] should take it to his heart for my thy
[1:18:05] servant does know that I have sinned
[1:18:07] therefore behold I am come the first
[1:18:08] this day of all the house of Joseph to
[1:18:11] get down to meet my Lord the king he
[1:18:13] said you see me I was down here
[1:18:16] first I bowed the knee first I'm not
[1:18:18] cursing this time because David was
[1:18:21] coming back in
[1:18:23] power now he he he repented but his
[1:18:26] heart didn't
[1:18:28] change he apologized but his heart
[1:18:30] wasn't changed and you'll find I don't
[1:18:33] have time to get in the whole story but
[1:18:34] you'll find that Solomon ended up
[1:18:36] killing him because David when he died
[1:18:38] before he died he asked he told Solomon
[1:18:40] he said you better watch that guy he
[1:18:42] said one day you'll have to take his
[1:18:44] head
[1:18:44] off and so Solomon puts him under house
[1:18:47] arrest he makes him his
[1:18:49] prisoner in in he makes him his prisoner
[1:18:52] there it's a actually as I think about
[1:18:54] it it's a great type of the Millennium
[1:18:57] because there will be some who will be
[1:18:58] there who will end up rebelling after
[1:19:00] the thousand years I can't even begin to
[1:19:02] explain that the best thousand years
[1:19:05] that there's ever been and at the end
[1:19:06] some
[1:19:07] Rebel but during this Millennial reign
[1:19:09] of Solomon as he was there here comes
[1:19:12] shemiah and Rebels during that time and
[1:19:14] how he does it is they put they made him
[1:19:17] a prisoner but he wouldn't stay within
[1:19:18] the walls of
[1:19:20] Jerusalem and when his slaves got out
[1:19:22] and went to another Another Part another
[1:19:24] another part of the country he went
[1:19:26] after him and he ended up
[1:19:27] dying but David still showed the type of
[1:19:31] Christ David did not lay retribution to
[1:19:35] him he let him wait until the time oh
[1:19:38] church we just remember he said
[1:19:39] vengeance is mine sayith the
[1:19:42] Lord we don't have to respond all the
[1:19:45] time very quickly we don't even have to
[1:19:47] respond uh very quickly to each other
[1:19:49] let God handle it maybe the Lord told
[1:19:52] them to do it
[1:19:55] no it's hard to take but it's
[1:19:57] true we find that in Christ when when he
[1:20:01] was on the cross and he cried out father
[1:20:03] forgive them they don't know what
[1:20:05] they're doing that same spirit that was
[1:20:07] in David and that same Spirit came on
[1:20:10] Stephen by the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:20:14] and step displayed the same thing when
[1:20:16] he was stoned he said lay not this sin
[1:20:18] to their charge and there was another
[1:20:21] benjamite right we've talked about
[1:20:23] Benjamin before benjam was a ravening
[1:20:25] wolf Benjamin is a type of the Flesh in
[1:20:28] the Bible he's a type of our flesh which
[1:20:30] is never converted but here uh here
[1:20:33] comes uh uh Stephen that said lay not
[1:20:36] this sin to their charge and a young
[1:20:38] Rabbi named Saul was watching that and
[1:20:42] he began breathing out threatenings and
[1:20:43] Slaughters to the son of
[1:20:45] David and and he let him go for a while
[1:20:49] but one day Saul was literally brought
[1:20:52] to his
[1:20:53] knees knocked off of his horse bowed
[1:20:56] down to the King of Kings he was
[1:20:58] completely forgiven oh I'm closing with
[1:21:00] this but listen he was completely
[1:21:02] forgiven he became a
[1:21:04] prisoner but you know legalism won't
[1:21:07] hold a benjamite in his
[1:21:10] place now I hope you catch that tonight
[1:21:13] legalism won't hold your flesh in its
[1:21:15] place Solomon could not hold Oh my he
[1:21:19] could not hold that benjami in his place
[1:21:23] right legalism would not have held Saul
[1:21:25] in his place but he said by the grace of
[1:21:27] God I am what I am oh I'm so glad for
[1:21:30] his grace tonight legalism won't hold
[1:21:33] you but love
[1:21:35] will Hallelujah love will hold you amen
[1:21:41] but now look one day every knee will bow
[1:21:44] do we believe that but Paul Paul would
[1:21:48] not go out of the Ark of Safety he was
[1:21:50] he said I keep under my body I bring it
[1:21:52] under subjection let's having him preach
[1:21:54] to others I'm myself should become a
[1:21:55] Cast Away what was he saying he's saying
[1:21:57] I'm a prisoner of love and he introduced
[1:22:00] himself Paul a prisoner of Jesus Christ
[1:22:03] just like shemiah only he had the Holy
[1:22:06] Ghost he could stay in the
[1:22:09] city he's unfolded himself he unfolded
[1:22:12] himself through Paul he unfolded himself
[1:22:15] through Moses through Joseph through
[1:22:17] David now he reveals
[1:22:20] himself in
[1:22:21] US wonder if that same Spirit could be
[1:22:24] in us tonight as we close as musicians
[1:22:28] come I wonder if that same Spirit could
[1:22:30] be in us as he unfolds himself in our
[1:22:34] lives that we could say father forgive
[1:22:38] them they don't know what they're doing
[1:22:40] maybe the Lord told them to do
[1:22:43] it maybe it happened for a
[1:22:46] reason even though we completely do not
[1:22:49] understand it but the spirit of Christ
[1:22:51] in US it won't hold a grudge the
[1:22:54] benjamite will but the spirit of Christ
[1:22:58] won't what was it we we are completely
[1:23:01] forgiven because we're a prisoner of his
[1:23:04] love and as he reveals himself in us we
[1:23:06] will forgive others we will re forgive
[1:23:10] others do you believe it tonight heyen
[1:23:12] let's bow our heads
[1:23:15] together I want to bow to him now don't
[1:23:19] you
[1:23:21] I I push through tonight I appreciate
[1:23:24] some of the brothers prayed with me
[1:23:25] before church I've been having trouble
[1:23:27] with my back and but I feel like the
[1:23:30] Lord's helped me in this service so
[1:23:32] thank you for praying for me
[1:23:35] and I I don't
[1:23:38] know maybe it's just for me but I feel
[1:23:41] like there's a lot more times when I
[1:23:43] could say maybe the Lord told him to do
[1:23:46] that instead of
[1:23:48] responding instead of trying to fix
[1:23:51] it if we just say maybe the Lord has a
[1:23:54] plan maybe we need to wait renew our
[1:23:58] strength and see what God does instead
[1:24:01] of responding quickly to these things is
[1:24:03] that your desire and your prayer say
[1:24:05] Lord I want you to unfold yourself in me
[1:24:07] would you would you raise your hand with
[1:24:08] me I I I want the hold the spirit of
[1:24:11] Christ to be unfolded in my life to
[1:24:13] where I can wait Lord if you don't deal
[1:24:16] with them till after the Millennium I'll
[1:24:18] still wait I'll wait I I want your
[1:24:21] spirit on me Lord I Want to Be Right I I
[1:24:24] want you to reveal yourself unfold
[1:24:26] yourself through my life in this way oh
[1:24:29] God that the people would know that I've
[1:24:32] been with you like they knew with stepen
[1:24:34] like they knew when Paul got saved let
[1:24:36] them know that I've been changed I've
[1:24:39] been taken I've been I've been taken out
[1:24:41] of this old benjamite flesh and
[1:24:43] something is holding me something Beyond
[1:24:45] Myself has grabbed a hold of me Heavenly
