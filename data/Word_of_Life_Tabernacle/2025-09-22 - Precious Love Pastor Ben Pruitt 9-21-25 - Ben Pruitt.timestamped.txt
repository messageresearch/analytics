[8:23] [Music]
[9:03] Greater is he that is in me.
[9:07] Greater is he that is in me than he that
[9:11] is in the world.
[9:15] Satan's like a roaring lion roaming to
[9:20] and fro
[9:23] seeking whom he may devour. The Bible
[9:28] tells us so.
[9:32] Many souls have been his prey to fall in
[9:37] some weak hour.
[9:40] But God has promised us today his
[9:45] overcoming
[9:46] power.
[9:49] Greater is he that is in me.
[9:53] Greater is he that is in me.
[9:57] Greater is he that is in me.
[10:01] than he that is in the world.
[10:05] And on the day of Pentecost,
[10:09] a rushing mighty wind
[10:14] blew into the upper room, baptized all
[10:20] of them
[10:22] with a power gater than any earthly foe.
[10:31] I'm so glad I've got it, too. I'm going
[10:35] to let the whole world know
[10:39] that greater is he that is in me.
[10:43] Greater is he that is in me.
[10:48] Greater is he that is in me than he that
[10:53] is in the world.
[10:59] Let's sing that song. I would not be
[11:00] denying.
[11:03] Start with the first verse, Brother
[11:04] Robert.
[11:07] When pains of death seized on my soul,
[11:13] unto the Lord I cry.
[11:18] Till Jesus came and made me whole. I
[11:24] would not be denied.
[11:29] I would not be denied.
[11:35] I would not be denied
[11:40] till Jesus came and made me whole. I
[11:46] would not be denied.
[11:51] As Jacob in the days of old, I wrestled
[11:58] with the Lord
[12:01] [Applause]
[12:02] and instant with the courageful
[12:08] I stood upon his word.
[12:13] I would not be denied.
[12:18] Oh no, I would not be denied
[12:23] till Jesus came and made me whole. I
[12:30] would not be denied.
[12:34] And old Satan said, "My Lord was gone
[12:40] and would not hear my prayer."
[12:46] But praise the Lord. The work is done in
[12:51] Christ the Lord is here.
[12:56] I would not be denied.
[13:01] No, I would not be denied
[13:07] till Jesus came and made me whole. I
[13:13] would not be denied. Let's try that
[13:17] first verse again. When pains of death
[13:21] ceased on my soul, unto the Lord I cry.
[13:29] Till Jesus came and made me whole. I
[13:35] would not be denied. Sing it with all
[13:39] your heart. I would not be denied.
[13:45] No, I would not be denied.
[13:50] Till Jesus came and laid me home. I
[13:56] would not be denied.
[14:00] No, I would not be denied.
[14:06] No, I would not be denied
[14:12] till Jesus came and made me whole. I
[14:18] would not be denied.
[14:23] You ask me why I'm happy, so I'll just
[14:27] tell you why. because
[14:31] my sins are gone.
[14:35] And when I meet the scoffers who ask me
[14:39] where they are, I say
[14:42] my sins are gone.
[14:46] They're underneath the blood on the
[14:49] cross of Calvary.
[14:52] as far removed as darkness is from dawn.
[14:57] It's in the sea of God's forgetfulness
[15:00] that's good enough for me. Praise God.
[15:05] My sins are gone.
[15:08] It was at the old time altar where God
[15:12] came in my heart.
[15:14] Now
[15:16] my sins are gone.
[15:19] The Lord took full possession. The devil
[15:23] did depart. I'm glad.
[15:27] My sins are gone.
[15:30] There underneath the blood on the cross
[15:34] of Calvary.
[15:36] As far removed as darkness is from dawn.
[15:41] It's in the sea of God's forgetfulness
[15:44] that's good enough for. Praise God,
[15:49] my sins are gone.
[15:53] When Satan comes to temp me and tries to
[15:57] take me back, I say
[16:00] my sins are gone.
[16:04] You got me into trouble, but Jesus got
[16:08] me out. I'm glad
[16:12] my sins are gone.
[16:15] There underneath the blood on the cross
[16:19] of Calvary.
[16:21] As far removed as darkness is from dawn.
[16:26] It's in the sea of God's forgetfulness
[16:29] that's good enough for me. Praise God.
[16:34] My sins are gone.
[16:37] I'm living now for Jesus. I'm happy
[16:41] night and day because
[16:45] my sins are gone.
[16:49] My soul is filled with music with all my
[16:52] heart. I say I know
[16:56] my sins are gone.
[16:59] There underneath the blood of the cross
[17:03] of Calvary.
[17:05] as far removed as darkness is from dawn.
[17:10] It's in the sea of God's forgetfulness
[17:14] that's good enough for me. Praise God.
[17:18] My sins are gone. Sing that chorus once
[17:21] again. There underneath the blood on the
[17:25] cross of Calvary.
[17:28] as far removed as darkness is from dawn.
[17:32] There in the sea of God's forgetfulness,
[17:36] that's good enough for me. Praise God.
[17:41] My sins are gone. Sing it one more time.
[17:44] There underneath the blood of the cross
[17:48] of Calvary.
[17:50] As far removed as darkness is from dawn.
[17:55] It's in the sea of God's forgetfulness.
[17:58] That's good enough for me. Praise God.
[18:03] My sins are gone.
[18:06] Amen. We'll have the ushers come at this
[18:09] time. Um the only prayer request I have
[18:12] is uh from the only new one is from my
[18:15] mother. It says, "Please pray for my
[18:17] grandma Sue Pitman. She's in the
[18:19] hospital not doing well." So let's
[18:21] remember that and just remember the
[18:23] request from this morning uh brother
[18:25] Biscll's family especially in prayer.
[18:28] I'll have brother Jared pray.
[18:31] Lord Jesus we come to you this evening
[18:33] Lord or this afternoon just thankful for
[18:36] another time that we get Lord to be able
[18:38] to gather around your word with your
[18:40] people Lord. We just pray that you would
[18:43] remember the needs Lord amongst your
[18:45] people Lord. pray that you would come
[18:47] down among us, Lord, and just meet each
[18:49] and every need. May you move in a mighty
[18:51] way, Lord. May you be with Brother Ben
[18:53] as he comes out and preaches the word.
[18:55] May you be in every aspect of the
[18:56] service, Lord. We thank you and worship
[18:58] you in Jesus Christ's name.
[19:03] [Music]
[19:07] Could you pull up those words, Brother
[19:08] Robert, to shout to the Lord?
[19:13] We'll start with the first verse.
[19:16] My Jesus,
[19:20] my savior,
[19:22] Lord, there is none like you.
[19:28] All of my days,
[19:31] I want to praise
[19:34] the wonders of your mighty
[19:40] love.
[19:44] My comfort,
[19:48] my shelter,
[19:51] tower of reuge.
[19:57] Let every breath
[20:00] all that I am.
[20:04] Never cease to worship
[20:07] [Applause]
[20:09] you.
[20:12] Shout to the Lord all the earth. Let us
[20:17] sing.
[20:20] Power and majesty,
[20:22] praise to the king.
[20:26] Mountains bow down and the seas will
[20:31] roar at the sound
[20:35] of your name.
[20:39] [Music]
[20:40] I sing for joy at the work of your hand.
[20:47] Forever I'll love you. Forever
[20:52] I'll stand.
[20:54] Nothing compares to the promise I have
[21:00] in you.
[21:06] My Jesus
[21:09] my savior.
[21:12] Lord, there is none like you.
[21:17] All of my days,
[21:21] I want to praise
[21:24] the wonders of your mighty
[21:29] love.
[21:34] my comfort.
[21:37] You're my shelter.
[21:43] And strength,
[21:45] let every breath
[21:48] all that I am.
[21:52] Never cease to worship
[21:55] [Applause]
[21:57] you.
[22:00] Bow to the Lord on the earth. Let us
[22:05] sing.
[22:07] Power and majesty
[22:10] praise to the king.
[22:14] Mountains bow down and the seas will
[22:19] roar at the sound
[22:23] of your name.
[22:28] I sing for joy at the work of your hand.
[22:35] Forever I'll love you. Forever
[22:39] I'll stand.
[22:42] Nothing compares to the promise I had in
[22:49] you.
[22:53] My Jesus,
[22:57] you're my savior.
[23:00] Lord, there is none like you.
[23:05] All of my days.
[23:08] I want to praise
[23:11] the wonders of your mighty.
[23:17] As Haley and the girls come to sing,
[23:21] my comfort,
[23:24] my shelter,
[23:27] tower of reuge.
[23:32] Let every breath,
[23:36] all that I am,
[23:39] never cease to worship
[23:43] [Applause]
[23:45] you.
[23:48] Shout to the Lord all the earth. Let us
[23:53] sing.
[23:55] Power and majesty
[23:58] praise to our king.
[24:02] Mountains bow down and the sea
[24:06] will roll at the sound
[24:11] of your name.
[24:14] hand.
[24:16] I sing for joy at the work of your hand.
[24:22] Forever I'll love you. Forever
[24:27] I'll stand.
[24:29] Nothing compares to the promise I have
[24:36] in you.
[24:38] Amen. Just give him a hand clap of
[24:40] praise as you're seated.
[24:54] [Music]
[25:04] Oh, what I would do to have the kind of
[25:08] faith it takes to climb out of this boat
[25:12] I'm
[25:15] on to the crashing waves
[25:19] to step out of my comfort zone
[25:23] into the realm of the unknown where
[25:26] Jesus is
[25:28] [Music]
[25:30] holding out his hand.
[25:33] waves. They calling out my name. And
[25:36] they laugh at me,
[25:41] reminding me of all the times I've tried
[25:45] before and fail.
[25:48] Boys they keep on telling me time and
[25:52] time again. Oh, you never win.
[25:58] You never win.
[26:03] But the voice of truth
[26:07] tells me a different story.
[26:10] And the voice of truth
[26:14] says, "Do not be afraid."
[26:17] And the voice of truth
[26:21] says, "This is for my glory."
[26:24] And all the voices calling out to me.
[26:32] I would choose to listen and believe
[26:37] are true.
[26:41] What I would do
[26:47] never dying
[26:51] just a sling in a star
[26:54] surrounded by a sound of a thousand
[26:58] warriors
[27:00] shaking in their armor.
[27:05] I was ashamed to stand up.
[27:09] I was holding out my name and they
[27:12] laughed at me
[27:17] all the time. I've tried before
[27:24] telling me time and time again. Oh, you
[27:29] never will.
[27:32] You never will.
[27:35] [Music]
[27:37] And the voice of truth
[27:41] tells me a different story.
[27:44] And the voice of truth
[27:48] says, "Do not be afraid."
[27:51] And the voice of truth
[27:55] says, "This is for my glory."
[27:58] Out of all the voices calling out to me,
[28:06] I will choose to listen and believe the
[28:10] voice of truth.
[28:17] On the ground
[28:21] seem so high
[28:24] looking down.
[28:26] I soar with the wings of eagles when I
[28:31] soft and listen to the sound of Jesus
[28:35] singing over
[28:37] me.
[28:40] Voice of truth
[28:43] tells me a different story.
[28:47] The voice of truth
[28:50] says do not be afraid.
[28:53] And the voice of truth
[28:56] says this is for my glory.
[29:00] Out of all the voices going after me.
[29:08] &gt;&gt; I wish to listen and believe the voice
[29:13] of truth.
[29:15] I used to listen and repeat the voice of
[29:20] truth.
[29:27] We're going to go ahead and have um uh
[29:30] Esther and Emma come up and sing with
[29:32] Nolley.
[30:14] [Music]
[30:23] Take my life and let it be my soul
[30:27] devoted Lord to thee. Take my moments
[30:32] and all my days.
[30:35] Make them in this praise. Take my heart
[30:40] and let it move
[30:42] in spirit and in truth for the glory of
[30:48] your name.
[30:53] With every breath that's in me, with
[30:57] every song in me,
[31:02] let it be a hallelu.
[31:06] [Music]
[31:08] In every breaking moment,
[31:12] in every blessing that you give,
[31:17] let it be a hallelujah.
[31:22] Oh Lord,
[31:24] let it be a hallelu.
[31:28] [Music]
[31:31] All my hopes and all my fears.
[31:35] Every child, every tear in the chaos in
[31:43] faithful all the way through the
[31:47] victories, through the scars. Let me
[31:50] echo who you are for the glory of your
[31:56] name.
[32:01] With every breath that's in me, with
[32:05] every song and me,
[32:09] let it be a hallelu.
[32:14] [Music]
[32:16] In every breaking moment,
[32:20] in every blessing that you give,
[32:24] let it be a hallelu,
[32:27] [Music]
[32:29] oh Lord,
[32:32] let it be a hallelu.
[32:36] Let it be a hallelu.
[32:40] Let it be a hallelu.
[32:44] Nothing but a hallelu
[32:47] to you God.
[32:51] Let it be a hallelujah.
[32:55] All my life a hallelu.
[32:58] Let it be a hallelu
[33:02] to you God.
[33:05] [Music]
[33:08] With every breath that's in me, with
[33:12] every song and mey,
[33:15] let it be. Let it be.
[33:22] With every breath that's in me, with
[33:26] every song and me,
[33:31] let it be a hallelujah.
[33:33] [Music]
[33:37] In every breaking moment,
[33:41] in every blessing that you give,
[33:46] let it be a hallelu.
[33:50] Oh Lord,
[33:53] let it be a hallelu.
[34:00] Let it be a hallelu.
[34:05] [Music]
[34:10] [Applause]
[34:34] It's hard to sing after that. That's
[34:37] good special. Give him another hand clap
[34:38] of praise.
[34:44] [Music]
[34:51] Let's try that song after all.
[34:58] After all this life is over
[35:03] and our burdens have been lifted and we
[35:09] stand upon the mountaintop
[35:13] so tall
[35:18] looking over in that city
[35:23] that the Savior is preparing.
[35:28] It gives me faith that I can make it
[35:33] after all.
[35:37] And after all, this life is over.
[35:43] And our burdens have been lifted. And we
[35:49] stand upon the mountain top so tall
[35:57] and look
[35:59] over in that city
[36:03] that the Savior is preparing.
[36:08] It gives me faith that I can make it
[36:13] after all. Can you stand and sing it?
[36:17] And after all this life is over
[36:23] and our burdens have been lifted and we
[36:28] stand upon the mountain top not so tall.
[36:35] Just sing it as our pastor comes.
[36:38] over in that city
[36:42] that the Savior is preparing.
[36:47] It gives me faith that I can make it
[36:52] after all.
[36:55] And after all, this life is over
[37:02] and our burdens have been lifted.
[37:07] And we stand upon the mountain top so
[37:12] tall.
[37:15] And looking over in that city
[37:21] that the Savior is preparing.
[37:26] It gives me faith that I can make it
[37:31] after all. Can we sing that one more
[37:34] time with After
[37:37] all this life is over
[37:41] and our burdens have been lifted glory
[37:46] and we stand upon the mountain top so
[37:52] tall.
[37:54] Oh, I'm looking over in a city
[38:01] where the Savior is preparing.
[38:06] He gives me grace and I can make it
[38:10] after all.
[38:13] Aren't you glad you believe you'll make
[38:15] it? Amen. Let's give the Lord another
[38:17] hand clap of praise. Aren't you glad
[38:19] after all this life is over and our
[38:22] burdens have been lifted? Amen. We stand
[38:25] there on the mountaintop. We're going to
[38:27] say, "I know that it made it by grace."
[38:30] Amen. Amen. Let's bow our heads
[38:33] together.
[38:36] I wonder tonight if we could just
[38:38] approach the Lord and just ask him to
[38:40] come in this service. I know there's a
[38:42] bunch of people gone this afternoon, but
[38:44] but we're just believing that the Lord
[38:46] will move for this service tonight. I
[38:48] pray that he would. Heavenly Father,
[38:51] Lord Jesus, we're so thankful to be here
[38:53] in your house once again and to thank
[38:55] you for your goodness and your mercy,
[38:58] Lord, that we have an after all to look
[39:00] forward to. Lord, your grace and your
[39:02] mercy's provided a a future for us. We
[39:05] thank you for that tonight. I pray that
[39:08] you'd move in a mighty way. Speak
[39:10] directly to your children tonight, Lord.
[39:12] I pray that you'd just move me out of
[39:14] the way and Lord, say what you have to
[39:17] say tonight. I pray you'd grant it now,
[39:20] Lord. Heal the sick, touch those that
[39:21] are in need. We pray in Jesus name.
[39:26] Amen.
[39:27] Amen. Thank the Lord. Amen. It's good to
[39:31] be with you tonight. We'll just go right
[39:33] into the word of God and just believe
[39:35] that he'll have something to say to us
[39:38] tonight. Matthew chapter 24 and verse
[39:40] 12. Matthew 24:12.
[39:45] Just that one verse tonight.
[39:49] says, "Because iniquity shall abound,
[39:52] the love of many shall wax cold."
[39:56] Because iniquity shall abound, the love
[39:59] of many shall wax cold. I pray the Lord
[40:01] that is blessing to the word. You may be
[40:03] seated this evening.
[40:07] That word many in the original
[40:10] uh don't really give us the force of of
[40:12] the original word. the he the original
[40:15] word is more it's saying that the
[40:19] majority the love of the majority so
[40:23] it's not just the love of many so we
[40:25] know there's many people who uh have
[40:28] hatred and not love in their heart for
[40:31] one another for God but he said the love
[40:34] of the majority will grow cold
[40:38] &gt;&gt; I think we've all seen that
[40:40] &gt;&gt; I think the last couple of weeks have
[40:42] maybe shown that to me, brother Matthew,
[40:44] more than ever before. How people just
[40:47] have hatred in their hearts.
[40:49] &gt;&gt; They hate one another. They hate one
[40:52] another because of politics. They hate
[40:53] one another because of race. They hate
[40:55] one another because of church or
[40:57] religion. They hate one another uh some
[40:59] of them hate God. They hate his people.
[41:01] And a and and it's it's a terrible time
[41:05] in that sense to be living in because
[41:07] the majority will never never love.
[41:09] They'll never experience the love of
[41:11] God. They can't they can't do that. And
[41:14] and and will always be in the minority.
[41:16] I was looking today at the uh memorial
[41:18] service for Charlie Kirk and I haven't
[41:20] spoken about that to you, but uh when he
[41:23] was assassinated here a couple of weeks
[41:25] ago, and they had his memorial service
[41:27] this afternoon, and I wasn't much
[41:29] interested in what the politicians had
[41:31] to say about it. But I did tune in to
[41:34] hear the pastor, his pastor speak this
[41:36] afternoon. And I'm thankful that the
[41:38] gospel was preached in whatever form
[41:40] that he was able to preach it. He
[41:42] preached it in that service. And I'm
[41:44] thankful that people got to hear that. I
[41:46] believe there will be people that will
[41:48] be in heaven because they heard the
[41:49] gospel preached just like that. And its
[41:52] simplicity that uh Christ died for our
[41:54] sins and we need to stand for him and
[41:56] believe there'll be people there because
[41:58] of that. And maybe because of the
[42:00] influence of of him and what they knew.
[42:02] But I got to thinking about that and I I
[42:04] thought, what would constrain a man?
[42:06] what would drive a man to do what
[42:08] Charlie did at 31 years of age to uh to
[42:11] go out and hold political rallies and go
[42:14] into these uh uh you'd almost have to be
[42:16] insane. And I guess it proved that it
[42:18] wasn't the best idea going into uh go
[42:20] into universities where a bunch of
[42:22] people hate what you believe and and put
[42:24] get up a sign says prove me wrong and
[42:26] stand under it and and when because
[42:29] people anymore if they can't argue with
[42:30] you they'll they'll just kill you. But
[42:33] that's just the age that we live in. And
[42:35] and so he he did a fearless thing to be
[42:38] able to do that. But what would drive a
[42:40] person to do that? Well, it would be
[42:42] love,
[42:43] &gt;&gt; right? It would be love. It'd be love
[42:45] for his family, love for his country.
[42:48] Hate wouldn't drive you to do that,
[42:50] &gt;&gt; but love would drive you to do that on
[42:52] whatever level that he had. He had some
[42:54] kind of love to be able to to do that.
[42:57] And and I thought of brother Biscll who
[42:59] passed on this week. and and I thought
[43:01] of the love that he had for the message
[43:03] of the hour and and the love for the
[43:05] people of God and just to see the
[43:07] message get out and it's getting rarer
[43:09] and rarer, brother Stewart, that people
[43:11] have that kind of love for the message
[43:12] of the hour. Well, I pray it would be
[43:14] here in our church and here in our in my
[43:16] ministry and the ministries of these
[43:17] brothers, we would have a love for the
[43:19] things of God. We would just love him
[43:21] with all of our heart. We don't do what
[43:22] we do because it's because it's uh you
[43:25] know people applaud you and people say
[43:28] no uh brother Bisco 40 years ago was
[43:30] going out in the wilderness of Africa
[43:32] and taking his wife leaving his family
[43:34] going out to spread the message and to
[43:37] tell people about the about the love of
[43:38] God about that. What was that? It was
[43:40] love in his heart for the people. It was
[43:42] love in his heart for the message. It
[43:44] was love in his heart for the things of
[43:45] God. I think there ought to be a people
[43:47] on the earth today. We may be the
[43:49] minority, the majority, the love of the
[43:51] majority is growing cold and and
[43:53] actually hate is growing in its place,
[43:56] but we we'll always be the minority, but
[43:58] may love go out from us in a mighty way.
[44:03] &gt;&gt; That people would feel it and they would
[44:04] know it. That we wouldn't we wouldn't
[44:06] step, well, there's not very many people
[44:08] here tonight. It's a Sunday night. But
[44:09] the love of God constrains us to preach
[44:12] the gospel. The love of God constrains
[44:14] us to give our all at every moment for
[44:17] the things of God. How many can say amen
[44:19] to that tonight?
[44:21] &gt;&gt; I'll give everything that I've got for
[44:23] the things of God. Paul says that. I
[44:25] didn't have put the scripture on the
[44:26] board, but he said the love of Christ
[44:28] constrains us. Why do we do what we do?
[44:30] Paul says we have a ministry of
[44:32] reconciliation. Why do we go out and
[44:34] spread the gospel? Why do we He said we
[44:36] persuade men of the gospel of Christ.
[44:38] Why do we do what we do? Because the
[44:41] love of God constrains us. Oh, that that
[44:43] love would always be a majority in our
[44:45] heart.
[44:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. Overcome every fear. Cuz perfect
[44:50] love cast out fear.
[44:53] And I want to preach tonight on precious
[44:56] love. If the love is not what the
[44:59] majority has,
[45:01] then it is precious in its rarity in the
[45:04] minority.
[45:06] It's precious. It's valuable.
[45:10] Not many people have it
[45:12] &gt;&gt; in the Thotiran church age. The true
[45:14] believers are commended for their love.
[45:17] In Revelation chapter 2 and verse 19
[45:18] said, "I know thy works and charity and
[45:21] service and faith and patience and works
[45:25] and the last to be more than the first."
[45:26] We don't gain salvation by works, but if
[45:30] you love God, there's something about
[45:31] you.
[45:34] You want to do something for God.
[45:36] Brother Joel today is traveling back
[45:38] from Georgia. And I appreciate brother
[45:40] Joel. I don't know if he's listening,
[45:41] but you know, we all we need to we got
[45:44] to stay humble. We've got to stay
[45:45] servants because that's what we are
[45:48] &gt;&gt; to the people of God.
[45:50] &gt;&gt; But he's not doing what he's doing just
[45:51] because he wants to travel. He's doing
[45:53] what he's doing because he loves people.
[45:54] And that's what we want. We can't You
[45:56] can't give that to somebody. You got to
[45:58] love people. And you can't give that to
[46:01] somebody. That's something that's got to
[46:02] be there. And you can train somebody.
[46:05] You can teach them how to do something,
[46:07] but you can't make them love people. You
[46:08] You could train somebody how to teach
[46:10] Sunday school, but you can't make them
[46:11] love the kids. They've got to do that.
[46:13] Got to be something in their heart to do
[46:15] that. You could train somebody to be a
[46:16] deacon, but you can't make them love to
[46:18] do it,
[46:19] &gt;&gt; right? It's hard to do. It's difficult
[46:21] job. I'm just preaching to you locals
[46:23] here tonight. We've got It's just us.
[46:25] So, let's just talk about it for a
[46:26] minute. you you don't do what you do
[46:28] because you're constrained by the pastor
[46:30] or you're constrained by the church or
[46:32] somebody made you do it, but you do what
[46:34] you do. And you got to keep this
[46:36] foremost in your mind or you'll never do
[46:38] it right. I love God's people and I love
[46:40] God. And so I want to do something for
[46:42] God. That's what keeps me preaching.
[46:44] That's what keeps me going. That's what
[46:46] keeps me going to the house of God.
[46:48] That's what keeps me pressing on in an
[46:50] hour when everybody's giving up and the
[46:52] love of many, the majority is going
[46:54] cold. Let me be on fire for the things
[46:57] of God. Let me be that minority that
[46:59] loves you with all of his heart.
[47:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[47:05] He said, "I know your works and love.
[47:08] I know your works and love and service
[47:10] and faith and patience and works
[47:15] and the last to be more than the first."
[47:16] Other words, the love doesn't diminish.
[47:18] The works don't diminish the works by
[47:20] love.
[47:22] Brother Brandon says, "I know your love,
[47:24] service, faith, and patience. You'll
[47:25] note their love is placed between works
[47:26] and service."
[47:29] &gt;&gt; And that is the right place for it
[47:32] because without love, our works are not
[47:33] accepted before God and neither is our
[47:36] service.
[47:38] &gt;&gt; Paul speaking to the Corinthians said,
[47:39] "Without love, I'm nothing."
[47:41] That ought to make us church. I know you
[47:44] can you can lose your love for the
[47:45] people. Brother Brandham said that one
[47:47] time. He lost his love. lost his lost
[47:49] his feeling for the people and he had to
[47:51] get it back.
[47:53] &gt;&gt; He had to repent of that. But but but
[47:55] without love, Paul said, "I'm nothing."
[47:58] And and so love has to go between works
[48:00] and service. Without love, I'm nothing.
[48:02] Whatever I do is without profit, unless
[48:04] it's done in love. He said, "Now, you
[48:06] can see right here, these believers
[48:07] weren't in that nickelan class that did
[48:09] works as a means of salvation or to be
[48:12] admired by men. They did their works out
[48:14] of the love of God that was shed abroad
[48:16] in their hearts by the Holy Ghost." that
[48:18] love in their hearts was God's love for
[48:20] his own. So God put love in the hearts
[48:23] of his people and it was God's love for
[48:26] his own shown through that person.
[48:28] That's what the message of the hour was.
[48:30] It was God's love for us in the day and
[48:32] hour that we live in shown through a
[48:34] prophet to the believer. It is God's
[48:36] love in a pastor today that'll keep him
[48:38] doing the work. It's God's love in
[48:40] evangelist that'll keep him running the
[48:41] the roads and going where to the people.
[48:44] God's love in the missionary that'll
[48:46] cause him to reach out to foreign lands.
[48:47] God's loving the teacher. God's love in
[48:49] all of the offices that are given. What
[48:51] is it? God's love in their hearts. And
[48:53] it's God's love for his own. Amen. Jesus
[48:56] said, "By this shall all men know that
[48:58] you're my disciples that you have love
[49:00] one for another."
[49:02] The pagans, he said, who saw the love
[49:04] the lives of the early Christians said,
[49:06] "Behold how they love each other."
[49:09] &gt;&gt; And John said, "Everyone that loveth is
[49:11] born of God."
[49:13] But the B said, I want to give a warning
[49:15] right here.
[49:16] It says concerning the last days because
[49:19] of How many know we're living living in
[49:20] the last days.
[49:22] &gt;&gt; If you don't know that, I don't know
[49:23] what rock you've been under,
[49:25] &gt;&gt; right? We're living in the last days.
[49:29] &gt;&gt; We're living in the last days.
[49:31] Everything the Bible said has come to
[49:32] pass.
[49:33] &gt;&gt; Living in the closing moments of
[49:35] history. He said that because of
[49:37] abounding iniquity the love of many will
[49:40] wax cold
[49:41] &gt;&gt; in the lee in our last age selflove. A
[49:44] prophet used that term before the world
[49:47] ever used it.
[49:48] &gt;&gt; But now that term is all over the place,
[49:50] self love,
[49:51] &gt;&gt; right? And and people realize they have
[49:53] to take care of themselves and they have
[49:55] to love themselves. But he said self
[49:57] love and love for material things will
[49:59] take the place of the true love of God.
[50:02] &gt;&gt; We need to guard against the power of
[50:04] sin in these last days. So many that are
[50:06] getting so hard because they haven't
[50:08] realized the effect of this last day
[50:10] spirit. It's time to draw nigh to God.
[50:12] Let him fill our lives with his love or
[50:15] we will feel the coldness of the last
[50:16] day church and reject the truth of God
[50:18] which alone is able to help us in those
[50:21] dark and dreadful years. The true vine
[50:23] he said held its love for God and love
[50:25] of the brethren. No, I believe the true
[50:26] vine today will hold its love for God
[50:28] and his love of the brethren. Do you
[50:30] believe that? I I believe that's why you
[50:32] come to church on a Sunday afternoon
[50:34] when you'd rather be taken than he
[50:36] because the true vine has a love for God
[50:38] and a love of the brethren.
[50:41] &gt;&gt; Love for God is a precious thing.
[50:45] Most people are not even conscious of
[50:47] God, much less love God.
[50:51] They don't even know. So we said this
[50:54] morning, being able to feel the presence
[50:56] of God is only by faith. You can't have
[50:59] faith unless God gave it to you.
[51:02] &gt;&gt; A true love for God must come from his
[51:04] love for us. John 3:16. For God so loved
[51:08] the world that he gave his only begotten
[51:11] son that whosoever believeth in him
[51:12] should not perish but have everlasting
[51:14] life. In John 15:13 said, "Greater love
[51:17] hath no man than this than a man lay
[51:20] down his life for his friends." In 1
[51:22] John 4:19, he said, "We love him because
[51:25] he first loved us." I talked about that
[51:28] Wednesday night, but if we could just
[51:29] dwell on that for a moment. He first
[51:31] loved us.
[51:32] &gt;&gt; How does he love us? How did he first
[51:35] loved us? See, we don't love God because
[51:38] of what he gives to us. We don't love
[51:41] him because even how good he's been to
[51:42] us. We sing about the goodness of God
[51:44] and we realize that he is good. He has
[51:47] been good all of our lives. He's been
[51:48] good.
[51:49] &gt;&gt; But he did not begin to love us when we
[51:51] were born,
[51:52] &gt;&gt; but he began back before time. Amen.
[51:55] &gt;&gt; Before we were anything but a thought in
[51:57] his heart, in his mind, he loved us
[52:00] then. How does he love us? We we know
[52:03] that Israel when they were uh when they
[52:05] were here, they didn't as a nation, they
[52:08] in the Old Testament, they didn't feel
[52:10] loved. Cuz sometimes when you're sitting
[52:12] under the the heat of God's wrath, you
[52:16] don't feel very loved. Sometimes when
[52:18] you're going through tribulation and
[52:20] trial and you're going through sickness,
[52:22] you're going through pain and you don't
[52:24] feel very loved and maybe you things
[52:28] haven't worked out the way you thought
[52:29] they would and maybe you didn't get
[52:31] everything you thought you would get out
[52:32] of out of the word and out of your
[52:34] Christian experience and you're sitting
[52:36] there saying, "Lord, I don't feel very
[52:38] loved. In fact, I don't feel very much
[52:39] at all."
[52:41] &gt;&gt; But love isn't about feeling.
[52:44] &gt;&gt; Love is about a choice.
[52:47] Listen to me, young people. You don't
[52:49] you the feeling that you have for a
[52:51] young man or a young woman will not keep
[52:54] you together.
[52:56] &gt;&gt; There's got to be a choice that you
[52:58] choose to love that person.
[53:00] &gt;&gt; And you're going to have to choose to
[53:01] love him every day. Every day of your
[53:03] life, you're going to wake up. It may
[53:04] not be a conscious choice, but uh
[53:06] Brother JT's not here tonight, so I'll
[53:08] pick on him. And Sister Clelet, I know
[53:09] when Sister Clelet got where she
[53:11] couldn't get up and fix breakfast in the
[53:12] morning, brother JT had had a stroke and
[53:14] they got to the place where brother JT
[53:17] and I'd watch him and he'd go in there
[53:19] and he'd fix breakfast for her in the
[53:21] morning. He could barely move and he
[53:23] he'd fix breakfast for her and they've
[53:24] been married over 50 years and I got to
[53:26] looking at that and I thought that's
[53:28] love right there. He making a choice. He
[53:30] didn't have to do that but he's making a
[53:32] choice cuz he loves his wife to go and
[53:34] do that. I think that's the kind of love
[53:35] we ought to have for each for each
[53:37] other. Especially in marriage, there
[53:39] ought to be a love there at choice.
[53:40] That's the way God loved you. He didn't
[53:42] love you when you were doing good. He
[53:44] loved you when you were doing bad. When
[53:45] you were the very worst of the worst,
[53:47] that's when he loved you. When you made
[53:49] your worst decisions, he loved you
[53:50] anyway. It's kind of love we're talking
[53:52] about. We don't believe in divorce. We
[53:54] don't get second chances. If you before
[53:56] you ever get married or tell somebody
[53:58] you want to marry them, you better be
[54:00] sure you can love them like that.
[54:03] Amen.
[54:05] &gt;&gt; And that kind of love was redemptive.
[54:09] It's redemptive.
[54:11] &gt;&gt; It'll change a situation.
[54:13] &gt;&gt; It'll bring you back from the brink.
[54:16] &gt;&gt; It'll change your your home. It'll
[54:18] change the world that you live in.
[54:21] Changed our world. When he came to us,
[54:26] Israel said, "I don't feel very loved."
[54:29] Malachi 1:2 he said, 'I have loved you,
[54:32] saith the Lord. Yet you say, wherein
[54:36] hast thou loved us? Still poor God.
[54:42] Haven't won the lottery yet
[54:45] cuz I don't play.
[54:49] I God, I'm still, you know, I'm still
[54:52] hurting. Still fat.
[54:57] Just trying to make you laugh.
[54:59] &gt;&gt; Worked on one person.
[55:03] God said, "I loved you."
[55:05] &gt;&gt; Right, young people? He said, "I love
[55:06] you."
[55:08] &gt;&gt; Said, "I have loved you." And you might
[55:10] look back and say, "Well, you didn't
[55:11] love me very much or I wouldn't look
[55:12] like this."
[55:17] &gt;&gt; He said, "I have loved you." Sayeth the
[55:20] Lord. Yet you say, "Where's Joel when
[55:23] you need him?" Yet you say, "Wherein
[55:25] hast thou loved us?"
[55:28] They said, "We we can't see any evidence
[55:30] of your love."
[55:31] &gt;&gt; Well, they weren't looking very hard,
[55:32] were they?
[55:33] &gt;&gt; Wherein hast was not Esau Jacob's
[55:35] brother, said the Lord. Yet I love
[55:37] Jacob.
[55:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And I hated Esau. Laid his
[55:42] mountains, his heritage waste for the
[55:44] dragons of the wilderness. It looked
[55:45] like Jacob had more problems in life. He
[55:48] was a worse person. He He didn't have as
[55:50] many advantages as Esau had. But look at
[55:53] the love that God had for him.
[55:54] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[55:55] &gt;&gt; Brother Brown said, you see, they could
[55:57] not figure out God's love. They thought
[55:58] that love meant no suffering. They
[56:00] thought that love meant a baby with
[56:02] parental care. But God said that his
[56:04] love was elective love. The proof of his
[56:06] love is election. No matter what
[56:08] happened. Can we say amen tonight? No
[56:10] matter what happened, his love was
[56:12] proven truly by the fact they were
[56:14] chosen to salvation. Because God hath
[56:16] chosen you to salvation through
[56:18] sanctification of the spirit and belief
[56:19] of the truth. He may commit you to death
[56:21] as he did Paul. He may commit you to
[56:23] suffering as he did Job. That is his
[56:25] prerogative. He is sovereign, but it is
[56:27] all with a purpose. If he did not have a
[56:29] purpose, then he would be the author of
[56:31] frustration and not of peace. Listen,
[56:33] listen to me. You say, "Well, I don't
[56:34] know the purpose of God." Well, Brother
[56:36] Brandham tells us what his purpose is.
[56:37] He said his purpose is that after we
[56:40] have suffered a while, we would be made
[56:42] perfect, be established, strengthened,
[56:44] and settled. As Job said, he puts
[56:46] strength in us. He puts strength in us.
[56:49] It doesn't mean that you won't go
[56:51] through no trials, but he make you
[56:52] strong enough to go through and come out
[56:55] on the other side. We ought to be
[56:56] witnesses of that tonight. We We may not
[56:58] have been saved from the trial, but we
[57:00] were saved through the trial. And we
[57:02] know that we only made it by the
[57:04] strength he put in us.
[57:06] &gt;&gt; He loved you first so you could love
[57:08] him. The cloudy skies and storms of life
[57:11] are no signs of God's disapproval.
[57:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:14] We need to grow up a little bit
[57:17] &gt;&gt; to the point where the cl every time the
[57:19] sky clouds up, we don't ask God why he
[57:22] doesn't love us.
[57:25] &gt;&gt; Right? I'm preaching to myself, too.
[57:29] Need to grow up a little bit. When the
[57:31] rain comes and the sky clouds up and the
[57:33] storms come, say, "Lord, I know you love
[57:36] me,
[57:38] &gt;&gt; so I know you're going to work this for
[57:40] my best, for my good." Amen.
[57:43] &gt;&gt; He said, "Neither are bright skies and
[57:45] still waters signs of his love and
[57:46] approval."
[57:48] &gt;&gt; Anybody can worship when everything's
[57:49] going good.
[57:51] &gt;&gt; I mean, that's it's not it's pretty
[57:53] rare, but once in a while, you know,
[57:54] when you're good, you know, I feel good.
[57:57] My job's doing good. My wife loves me
[57:59] today, and my kids said they love me
[58:02] today, and everything's going good, and
[58:03] you're sitting there thinking, boy,
[58:05] right now, I could just worship.
[58:07] But I love the fact that when Job got
[58:09] the bad news that he got, maybe the
[58:11] worst news anybody got ever in one day,
[58:14] that they didn't take it easy on him, he
[58:16] lost it all everything he had. He lost
[58:18] everything he loved. He lost everything,
[58:21] all of his family. He got all that bad
[58:24] news. And the Bible said when he got
[58:26] done getting the news, they brought it
[58:27] to him. He fell down and worshiped God.
[58:31] &gt;&gt; He said, "I came naked into the world.
[58:33] I'll go naked out of the world. I didn't
[58:35] bring nothing. I won't take nothing with
[58:36] me, but God, I love you. I worship you.
[58:39] You're still God. Amen. He said, "Though
[58:41] he saves me, I'll trust him." Oh, how
[58:43] many can have that attitude today? Hey,
[58:45] listen to me. The church, God's sign of
[58:47] approval on the church is not how many
[58:48] people are sitting in the pew, but God's
[58:50] sign of approval to this church is the
[58:52] word that's being preached that he loves
[58:54] us, or he wouldn't give us his word. He
[58:56] loves us, or he wouldn't have brought us
[58:57] to the message of the hour.
[59:00] His
[59:02] approval of us is only in the beloved.
[59:06] Love is elected which he had for us
[59:08] before the foundation of the world. Does
[59:09] he love us? Ah yes.
[59:12] But how shall we know? We shall know
[59:15] because he said so.
[59:17] And manifested that he did love us for
[59:19] he brought us to himself and gave us of
[59:22] his spirit placing us as sons.
[59:26] &gt;&gt; Did you catch that quote this morning?
[59:28] Brother Brandon said that the same
[59:30] pillar of fire, he said, is in his
[59:32] adopted sons today.
[59:35] Oh God, do we realize that? What he
[59:38] said, Brother Ben, what places us as
[59:40] sons? We're going to get into adoption
[59:41] on Wednesday nights as L or Terry's this
[59:44] Wednesday night, but the Kobe Martin is
[59:45] going to be here. We're looking forward
[59:47] to having him with us. He's coming
[59:49] through and I ask him to preach on
[59:50] Wednesday night. But I, you know, we're
[59:53] going to get into that on Wednesday
[59:54] night about adoption. But I'll say this,
[59:56] it's this message that places us as
[59:58] sons. We didn't know who we were, but
[1:00:01] the message of the hour brought in the
[1:00:03] age of adoption. That's what it is. Not
[1:00:05] a fourth work of grace, but this is the
[1:00:07] age of adoption. And in this age, we can
[1:00:10] become all that God wanted us to be as
[1:00:12] the bride. We can become full full grown
[1:00:15] sons of God, daughters of God. He said
[1:00:17] he give us of his spirit, placing us as
[1:00:19] sons. How shall I prove my love to him?
[1:00:22] By believing what he said.
[1:00:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. Listen, I can't work hard enough
[1:00:26] to make make it up to him. I can't do
[1:00:28] that. But by believing what he said and
[1:00:30] by conducting myself with joy amidst the
[1:00:32] trials he and his wisdom allows to come
[1:00:34] to pass.
[1:00:37] See, if you love God, want to worship
[1:00:39] him, want to do what the Bible says,
[1:00:41] that's precious.
[1:00:43] Do you know that
[1:00:45] you're special? Turn around to your
[1:00:47] neighbor if you have one tonight and
[1:00:49] say, "You're special."
[1:00:54] You're special.
[1:00:57] Say that to the people in the folks in
[1:00:59] the back sitting by themselves. You're
[1:01:00] special.
[1:01:02] You are.
[1:01:05] &gt;&gt; The Bible says that
[1:01:07] &gt;&gt; what you have is more valuable than
[1:01:10] gold. You are the one
[1:01:13] sheep that he left the 90 and nine for.
[1:01:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:19] &gt;&gt; So grateful that he did. Amen.
[1:01:22] &gt;&gt; It's his precious love that did that.
[1:01:24] His special love for you.
[1:01:26] &gt;&gt; He put that special love in you. The
[1:01:29] call of God that we have in our hearts
[1:01:31] and our response to him should not be
[1:01:34] taken for granted. The deep calling to
[1:01:37] the deep, the desire to be in the house
[1:01:39] of God, the desire to say yes, Lord. We
[1:01:42] shouldn't take that for granted.
[1:01:44] In Matthew 4:18, Jesus is walking by the
[1:01:48] Sea of Galilee. And he saw two brethren,
[1:01:50] Simon called Peter and Andrew his
[1:01:52] brother, casting a net into the sea, for
[1:01:53] they were fishers. And he saith unto
[1:01:56] them, "Follow me, and I will make you
[1:01:59] fishers of men." Now, he hadn't gone
[1:02:00] through and had a big campaign,
[1:02:02] fisherman campaign, and outreach to
[1:02:04] fisherman and tried to dress himself up
[1:02:06] like a fisherman and go by. And he
[1:02:08] didn't do that. He only went to them,
[1:02:11] right? and James and John, right? But he
[1:02:14] didn't go to all the fishermen, but he
[1:02:16] went to certain fishermen.
[1:02:18] &gt;&gt; He come by my way.
[1:02:21] &gt;&gt; And what did he do when he come by my
[1:02:22] way? When he come by their way, he said,
[1:02:24] "Follow me." Now, I want you to
[1:02:27] understand how odd this is, right? Are
[1:02:30] you still with me tonight?
[1:02:31] &gt;&gt; We won't hold you long. I want you to
[1:02:33] understand how odd this is. I mean, I
[1:02:35] took like like hours of material out of
[1:02:38] this sermon. So,
[1:02:42] We were in Togo, West Africa, and they
[1:02:43] would cast the net. They let us help
[1:02:45] them pull it back in. It's It's really
[1:02:47] neat because they still use the same
[1:02:48] kind of fishing technique. They just
[1:02:50] walk out into the surf and cast a net
[1:02:52] and pull it. It's very, very difficult
[1:02:54] to pull back in. So, they they would
[1:02:58] cast a net and they would pull it in or
[1:02:59] they would go out in the boat and they'd
[1:03:00] cast a net and bring it into the boat.
[1:03:02] So, they would have to be strong, burly
[1:03:05] men. These were real men, right? And
[1:03:10] here comes Jesus
[1:03:12] walking by.
[1:03:15] He says, "You, Peter,
[1:03:19] follow me."
[1:03:21] And they did.
[1:03:23] &gt;&gt; The Bible says they just dropped their
[1:03:25] nets and did it. What? Put something was
[1:03:28] in their heart,
[1:03:29] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:03:30] &gt;&gt; And people just don't do that.
[1:03:32] &gt;&gt; You do that. You just go try it
[1:03:34] sometime. go by damn three up here at
[1:03:36] the
[1:03:38] walk by there and catch some guy in
[1:03:40] there fishing and say follow me and
[1:03:43] watch him drop his $500 fly rod into the
[1:03:47] water and just take off after you. He
[1:03:50] ain't going to do that. You say you're
[1:03:52] an idiot,
[1:03:54] right? They going to do that. What What
[1:03:57] created a response?
[1:04:00] They may have a hundred teachers come by
[1:04:02] said, "Why don't you be my disciple? why
[1:04:04] don't you be my disciple? But Jesus
[1:04:06] didn't have to persuade. He didn't have
[1:04:08] to go in there and make them feel good
[1:04:09] about themselves and and and set up all
[1:04:12] kinds of things for them to do and and
[1:04:14] say, "Peter, if you'll follow me, I'll
[1:04:15] make you I'll make you fishers of men."
[1:04:17] He told them that, but he never told
[1:04:18] them they were going to be persecuted.
[1:04:20] Peter was going to end up dying on a
[1:04:22] cross.
[1:04:25] &gt;&gt; But but they he didn't tell them. He
[1:04:27] didn't make a bunch of empty promises.
[1:04:29] What did he say? Follow me and I'll make
[1:04:31] you fishers of men. and they straightway
[1:04:32] left their nets,
[1:04:35] left their money, left their job, left
[1:04:37] everything and said, "We'll follow you,
[1:04:38] Lord."
[1:04:40] Who does that?
[1:04:43] Don't take your response to the word for
[1:04:44] granted. When you hear the word says,
[1:04:46] "Go out and live a Christian life. You
[1:04:48] ladies dressed a certain way. You men
[1:04:50] act in a certain way and and he tells
[1:04:52] you to do that and you go do it." Don't
[1:04:54] take that for granted.
[1:04:57] &gt;&gt; What What is that response? It's it's
[1:04:59] election in your heart.
[1:05:05] It's the reason brother Brown said
[1:05:06] people can't believe in miracles today
[1:05:08] because they don't have anything in them
[1:05:09] to believe with.
[1:05:11] &gt;&gt; They got to have something in there to
[1:05:12] believe with. See, that's the majority.
[1:05:15] The love of the majority is waxing cold.
[1:05:17] The love of the majority. They don't
[1:05:18] believe in the supernatural. And the
[1:05:21] spirit of God is in a man. He'll say
[1:05:22] amen to every word of God and every
[1:05:24] miracle of God. As my mother used to
[1:05:26] say, you can't get blood from a turn it
[1:05:28] because there's no blood in it. So
[1:05:30] that's the same way you can't get belief
[1:05:32] out of an unbeliever because there's
[1:05:33] nothing there to believe with. But if
[1:05:35] you got something to believe with, we
[1:05:37] ought to be thankful for that today.
[1:05:40] &gt;&gt; That's the love of God. It's a rare
[1:05:41] thing. It's precious love. Brother
[1:05:44] Brandon said, "You got to be born,
[1:05:45] regenerated, baptized with the Holy
[1:05:46] Ghost into Jesus Christ, quickened to
[1:05:48] every word. Your spirit in you will
[1:05:50] punctuate amen to every word of the
[1:05:52] Bible. outside of that if listen if it
[1:05:55] shakes its head on one
[1:05:58] &gt;&gt; he said you get rid of that spirit
[1:06:01] &gt;&gt; that's not the Holy Spirit
[1:06:04] &gt;&gt; right if it's the word you don't have to
[1:06:07] agree with everything I say you don't
[1:06:08] have to agree with everything one of the
[1:06:10] other preachers say but you got to agree
[1:06:11] with the word
[1:06:13] &gt;&gt; right and if you shake your head on one
[1:06:14] word
[1:06:16] &gt;&gt; oh that's listen that's what the Holy
[1:06:17] Ghost is something in you that says amen
[1:06:20] to every word
[1:06:22] &gt;&gt; and outside of If it shakes its head on
[1:06:24] one, you get rid of that spirit. It's
[1:06:26] not the spirit of God that would dispute
[1:06:27] the word of God. It'll keep the word of
[1:06:29] God. Not only does it believe it, but it
[1:06:32] makes it live. It manifests the word of
[1:06:34] God. Oh, I thank God for that today. You
[1:06:36] say, "Who can do that? Who would leave
[1:06:38] their nets and follow him in this age?
[1:06:40] Who would do that? Who would follow the
[1:06:41] message of the hour? Who would devote
[1:06:43] their lives to it?" Only the bride can
[1:06:45] do that.
[1:06:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:49] &gt;&gt; It's a precious love.
[1:06:52] If our love for God is precious,
[1:06:53] brotherly love is precious as well. And
[1:06:55] I know I preach a lot about love and
[1:06:57] very little about do this and do that
[1:07:00] and the other, but I believe if we loved
[1:07:01] right, we would do
[1:07:03] &gt;&gt; what we needed to do.
[1:07:07] &gt;&gt; Mark 12 28 says, "One of the scribes
[1:07:11] came and having heard them reasoning
[1:07:12] together and perceiving he had answered
[1:07:13] them well, asked them him, which is the
[1:07:16] first commandment of all." Did you know
[1:07:18] he didn't say long dresses?
[1:07:23] And I believe
[1:07:25] in long dresses.
[1:07:27] That's not what he said. He didn't say
[1:07:29] don't cut your hair. I believe that
[1:07:32] women shouldn't cut their hair. That is
[1:07:34] what he said is the most important
[1:07:36] commandment. What's the first
[1:07:37] commandment? Jesus answered the first of
[1:07:39] all commandments is here. Oh Israel,
[1:07:40] Lord, our God is one Lord. And thou
[1:07:43] shalt love the Lord thy God all thy
[1:07:46] heart.
[1:07:48] &gt;&gt; He doesn't just tell us to we should
[1:07:49] love him. He said, "Thou shalt love him
[1:07:51] with
[1:07:54] &gt;&gt; all." Someone say, "All."
[1:07:56] &gt;&gt; All thy heart, with all thy soul, with
[1:08:00] all thy mind, with all thy strength.
[1:08:03] This is the first commandment.
[1:08:06] &gt;&gt; And just for for extra, he drops this
[1:08:08] in. But he said the second is like
[1:08:10] namely this thou shalt love thy neighbor
[1:08:14] as thyself.
[1:08:16] There's none other commandment greater
[1:08:20] than these. They ask him who is our
[1:08:21] neighbor and he goes on to explain who
[1:08:23] your neighbor is somebody that you meet
[1:08:24] that's in need
[1:08:26] &gt;&gt; that needs something that something that
[1:08:27] you can give something you can pour out
[1:08:29] to them. That's your neighbor. Now look
[1:08:34] in 1 John 4:20 it says, "If a man say, I
[1:08:37] love God and hateth his brother, he's a
[1:08:39] liar." That's pretty strong, isn't it?
[1:08:42] &gt;&gt; Listen to me, church. Don't let
[1:08:44] political events inspire hatred in your
[1:08:46] heart.
[1:08:48] &gt;&gt; I say that to those that are here and
[1:08:49] those that are not who watch this
[1:08:51] service. Don't let what's going on,
[1:08:53] don't let Facebook stir you into a
[1:08:55] frenzy.
[1:08:57] &gt;&gt; If you can't keep it good on there, then
[1:08:59] get off of it.
[1:09:01] &gt;&gt; Right? And if if you're going to going
[1:09:02] to call people names and stuff, it's no
[1:09:04] place for that. That is not a Christian.
[1:09:06] That's not what a Christian does. If if
[1:09:09] a man say, "I love God hateth his
[1:09:10] brother," he's a liar.
[1:09:12] &gt;&gt; For he that loveth not his brother, whom
[1:09:14] he hath seen, how can he love God whom
[1:09:16] he hath not seen?
[1:09:18] &gt;&gt; Oh God. And this commandment have we
[1:09:21] from him, that he who loveth God love
[1:09:23] his brother also? By this shall all men
[1:09:26] know that you're my disciples. In John
[1:09:27] 13:35, if you have love one to another,
[1:09:31] I want to read you a quote and we've all
[1:09:33] read it. We've heard it many times in
[1:09:34] the word to the church, but I think we
[1:09:36] missed the significance of the quote.
[1:09:38] Brother Brandon says this. He said,
[1:09:40] 'Now, you got tapes on that. You got
[1:09:41] tapes on what we believe. You got tapes
[1:09:43] on discipline in the church, how we
[1:09:45] behave oursel in the church of God. Why
[1:09:47] do we have church like we do? Because
[1:09:49] brother Brandham told us to.
[1:09:52] &gt;&gt; That's the reason I preach because
[1:09:54] brother Brandham said to do that,
[1:09:56] &gt;&gt; right? And I can't get past that. I
[1:09:58] can't get beyond that. But brother
[1:10:00] Brandon said, "You got tapes on that. We
[1:10:01] can we can go and listen to those tapes
[1:10:03] and we know." He said, "If there was a
[1:10:05] question about it, we could even play
[1:10:06] that tape and they people would know
[1:10:08] what what it was." He said, "How we
[1:10:10] behave ourselves in the church of God,
[1:10:11] how we got to come together. We got to
[1:10:14] come here together and sit together in
[1:10:15] heavenly places." He said, "Don't stay
[1:10:17] home. If God is in your heart, you can't
[1:10:19] hardly wait for them doors to open out
[1:10:21] yonder to get in here to fellowship with
[1:10:23] your brothers."
[1:10:24] &gt;&gt; If you don't feel that way, I tell you,
[1:10:25] it's time you got to pray. And I think
[1:10:26] we always put the emphasis on that. It's
[1:10:28] like a quote that we use to get people
[1:10:30] back in church. But brother Brandon was
[1:10:32] talking about something much deeper than
[1:10:33] that.
[1:10:35] &gt;&gt; Right? Because godly people are going to
[1:10:36] miss church,
[1:10:37] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:10:38] &gt;&gt; At some point or another.
[1:10:40] &gt;&gt; Christian people full of the Holy Ghost
[1:10:42] at some point or another going to miss
[1:10:43] church. And so I think on some level all
[1:10:46] of us fail at this quote,
[1:10:49] &gt;&gt; right? Because I I make almost every
[1:10:51] service but not every one because at
[1:10:53] some point I need a break,
[1:10:55] &gt;&gt; right? I don't need a break from church,
[1:10:57] but I this is where I work. This is what
[1:10:59] we do. And so sometimes we'll go other
[1:11:01] places, go to other churches or go to a
[1:11:03] meeting or take a vacation. And so all
[1:11:05] of us would fail if we held ourselves to
[1:11:06] a standard every time the doors are
[1:11:08] open. We have to be at church.
[1:11:10] &gt;&gt; But but brother Brandon saying something
[1:11:12] to us. And I think we miss what he was
[1:11:13] saying.
[1:11:15] &gt;&gt; Listen what he says. If God is in your
[1:11:16] heart,
[1:11:20] &gt;&gt; why would a man like Charlie Kirk go and
[1:11:22] do what he did? Because he loves
[1:11:23] something.
[1:11:24] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:11:25] Are you with me now?
[1:11:27] &gt;&gt; Why would a man like Ed Biscll go and do
[1:11:29] what he did? Because he loves something.
[1:11:33] &gt;&gt; Why would you go to church? Some of you
[1:11:34] elders come over and over and over
[1:11:36] again. Some of our young people come and
[1:11:38] and are faithful. Some of our families
[1:11:40] are faithful to the house of God. Why do
[1:11:41] you do what you do? Because you love
[1:11:43] God. There's something in your heart
[1:11:48] &gt;&gt; so you don't make decisions that'll keep
[1:11:50] you out of church
[1:11:52] &gt;&gt; because you love God. Amen.
[1:11:55] &gt;&gt; Are you with me now?
[1:11:56] &gt;&gt; It's almost something deeper than just,
[1:11:58] you know, well, if I miss the service, I
[1:12:00] got to feel condemned. I I know what
[1:12:02] that feels like, man. It's almost not
[1:12:03] worth it not coming to church cuz you
[1:12:04] feel so bad.
[1:12:07] &gt;&gt; Is anybody with me?
[1:12:08] &gt;&gt; But that's what he's talking about. It's
[1:12:11] not how often you come to church. It's
[1:12:13] that desire in your heart.
[1:12:16] &gt;&gt; And I want you all to be here every
[1:12:17] time, but I realize that's the standard
[1:12:19] nobody can meet,
[1:12:22] &gt;&gt; right? Except for brother Harvey. Maybe
[1:12:24] he meets that standard. I don't know.
[1:12:25] But
[1:12:29] remarkable.
[1:12:30] Remarkable. But but there's a lot goes
[1:12:32] into something like that.
[1:12:34] &gt;&gt; Right. That don't just happen.
[1:12:36] &gt;&gt; It's cuz somebody feels that way.
[1:12:39] &gt;&gt; I've never told our deacons, you got to
[1:12:41] be here all the time. Our elders, you
[1:12:42] got to be here all the time. Young
[1:12:44] people, we got to be here all the time.
[1:12:45] I try not to preach at people who aren't
[1:12:47] here. But it's there's got to be
[1:12:48] something there. We're talking about
[1:12:49] something deeper than just He said,
[1:12:51] don't stay home. If you can go to
[1:12:53] church, go to church.
[1:12:55] &gt;&gt; But not because he said it, but because
[1:12:57] God is in your heart.
[1:12:59] &gt;&gt; If God is in your heart, you'll want to
[1:13:00] obey what he said.
[1:13:02] &gt;&gt; He's not griping about folks not
[1:13:04] attending church. He's saying if you
[1:13:05] don't love God and you don't love his
[1:13:06] people, something's wrong. But let me
[1:13:08] give you a little bit of hope here
[1:13:09] today. If you find yourself lacking the
[1:13:11] love of God and the love of his people,
[1:13:13] you can there's a place you can go back
[1:13:15] to and pick up where you left off and
[1:13:17] find a place and altar and get that
[1:13:19] kindle back in your heart again. It
[1:13:22] don't mean you're not a Christian. It
[1:13:23] means the love is kind of waxing cold,
[1:13:25] but don't go with the majority. The the
[1:13:27] poem said, "Don't be like dumb dumb
[1:13:29] driven cattle. Stand against the foe.
[1:13:32] Stand against the enemy. Be a hero in
[1:13:34] the strife.
[1:13:38] We're in the last days." Brother Brandon
[1:13:39] said, now that's the next quote. He
[1:13:42] said, "Cuz we're in the last days." The
[1:13:45] Bible exalted and said much more
[1:13:47] exhorted us much more as we see that day
[1:13:49] approaching to love one another with
[1:13:50] Christian love and divine love. That's
[1:13:52] what he's talking about
[1:13:54] &gt;&gt; to assemble ourselves together in
[1:13:56] heavenly places in Christ Jesus love one
[1:13:57] another. I don't care what anybody says.
[1:14:00] If you tell me I can't go to church
[1:14:01] anymore, I'm not going to obey that.
[1:14:03] Yeah,
[1:14:05] &gt;&gt; we we discovered that during co we
[1:14:07] didn't like that much
[1:14:11] &gt;&gt; cuz the love of God was in our hearts.
[1:14:13] &gt;&gt; And this church, you know, we didn't
[1:14:14] have as many as we do now. But I tell
[1:14:16] you what, there were services during co
[1:14:18] I had people call me, can I come to
[1:14:19] church? I said, you be one of the 10. My
[1:14:22] math wasn't very good.
[1:14:26] Remember when they limit us to 10 people
[1:14:27] and 40 people would show up?
[1:14:30] But we didn't do that. We weren't if we
[1:14:31] were trying to keep people from coming
[1:14:32] to church because they were afraid of
[1:14:34] what would happen. We were trying to
[1:14:35] protect people the best we knew how. But
[1:14:37] I'll say this, the love of God was in
[1:14:39] the people's hearts. They wanted to go
[1:14:40] to church.
[1:14:42] &gt;&gt; And we saw revival among young people
[1:14:44] after that around the message. We saw a
[1:14:46] revival after that broke and people were
[1:14:48] able to come together again. They didn't
[1:14:49] care if they all caught CO every time
[1:14:51] they went to camp. There was a revival
[1:14:52] in their heart because they'd seen what
[1:14:53] it was like to not be in the house of
[1:14:55] God. And they said, "Lord, we realize we
[1:14:57] need the house of God." I pray that God
[1:14:59] will put something in our heart. Not
[1:15:00] because a preacher preaches it. Not
[1:15:02] because somebody hit hit you over the
[1:15:03] head with it or somebody makes you feel
[1:15:05] bad because you didn't come, but because
[1:15:07] the love of God was in your heart. You
[1:15:08] can say, "I just I just want to be in
[1:15:10] the presence of God." There's some I
[1:15:12] I've challenged our musicians. I've
[1:15:14] challenged our song leader. I've
[1:15:16] challenged brother Joel. I think I've
[1:15:17] told this to brother Stewart. We ought
[1:15:18] to make church so re such such a a time
[1:15:22] of fellowship and a time of the word
[1:15:24] being preached. We ought to make the
[1:15:25] atmosphere so rich people would want to
[1:15:27] come to the house of God. I don't want
[1:15:29] to have to beat you up about going to
[1:15:31] church. Let's make it a place where
[1:15:32] people want to be in the house of God.
[1:15:37] &gt;&gt; We won't do that by catering to every
[1:15:39] whim, but we preach the word and
[1:15:41] Christians will want to be because their
[1:15:43] love for God, they want to be where the
[1:15:44] word is preached.
[1:15:47] Don't ever think, "Brother Ben's against
[1:15:49] me because I don't make it all the
[1:15:50] time." Don't think that. Don't let the
[1:15:51] devil get in your heart, that in your
[1:15:52] heart. No. If you love God's people and
[1:15:55] you love God, you'll be at church when
[1:15:57] you can.
[1:16:00] Brother Brandon quoted that. This will
[1:16:01] all men know you're my disciples when
[1:16:02] you have love one for the other. That's
[1:16:03] right. Stay right together. If the
[1:16:06] brother you think he's a little wrong or
[1:16:07] the sister say, "Lord,
[1:16:09] boy, I was going to take a show of
[1:16:10] hands. I better not keep your hands
[1:16:13] down." But how many of you think a
[1:16:14] brother is a little wrong?
[1:16:18] Half of you thought of me, didn't you?
[1:16:22] It's okay. That would be I may be a
[1:16:24] little wrong. Are you with me? Melody's
[1:16:27] like, "Yes, sir."
[1:16:31] She thinks I'm a lot wrong. I won't let
[1:16:34] her have a phone yet. But anyway,
[1:16:37] if you think Melody, your dad's a little
[1:16:40] wrong
[1:16:42] or the sister, maybe you think your
[1:16:43] mom's a little wrong, say, "Lord, don't
[1:16:47] let me never have the root of bitterness
[1:16:49] spring up
[1:16:51] &gt;&gt; because it'll affect him
[1:16:53] &gt;&gt; and it'll take the Christ right out of
[1:16:55] my life.
[1:16:56] And
[1:16:56] &gt;&gt; how many people sit at home when they
[1:16:58] they say they will tell you they believe
[1:17:00] everything a prophet said yet they'll
[1:17:02] sit home instead of go to the house of
[1:17:03] God because they got hurt in church.
[1:17:07] &gt;&gt; What was it? A rooe of bitterness come
[1:17:09] in.
[1:17:09] &gt;&gt; I don't say they're not good people but
[1:17:11] they got their feelings hurt in church.
[1:17:12] So they won't come to the house of God
[1:17:14] and fellowship. They've lost their love
[1:17:15] for God and they've lost their love for
[1:17:17] the word. They've lost their love for
[1:17:18] the people of God. I say it's time to
[1:17:20] come back and get a another baptism of
[1:17:22] love.
[1:17:23] &gt;&gt; Find what's been lost.
[1:17:27] And brother Brandham said that poison
[1:17:28] acids and malice and jealousy and hatred
[1:17:30] will take the Holy Spirit right away
[1:17:31] from you. It'll run him from the
[1:17:33] tabernacle. It'll kill the spirit of
[1:17:34] God. Drive it away from here. It'll hurt
[1:17:36] your pastor. It'll do everything. He
[1:17:38] said, "Don't you do that." See, we could
[1:17:40] we could come to every service and and
[1:17:42] go home and feed our families poison
[1:17:44] about the ministry or poison about the
[1:17:46] church and we'd be just as bad as a
[1:17:48] person that don't come.
[1:17:52] &gt;&gt; What should we be doing? Trying to lift
[1:17:53] them up in prayer. The Lord, help my
[1:17:55] pastor. He may not be doing a very good
[1:17:57] job right now. Help him to do a better
[1:17:59] job. Help him. He's he's he's standing
[1:18:01] in a in a precarious situation and in a
[1:18:04] public place trying to declare the word
[1:18:06] of God. Help him. Protect him. Help the
[1:18:08] deacons. Help the trustees. Help the
[1:18:10] people that have to make decision. Don't
[1:18:11] sit there and criticize them. Brother
[1:18:13] Brandon said, "We ought to buckle up."
[1:18:14] There was a man who had a vision and
[1:18:16] talked about buckling up the whole armor
[1:18:17] of God. Brother Brandon said, "Tighten
[1:18:18] up. Move right up close to one another.
[1:18:20] Love one another." Anyhow, talk nice
[1:18:22] about one another. Say nice things about
[1:18:24] one another and God will bless you. How
[1:18:26] many want to be blessed today? Say
[1:18:28] something nice about somebody and God
[1:18:30] will bless you.
[1:18:33] &gt;&gt; If you go home and you eat preachers for
[1:18:35] lunch, eventually you're going to need
[1:18:36] one and you've digested them all.
[1:18:46] &gt;&gt; Are you still with me? Everybody said
[1:18:48] bring back brother Joel,
[1:18:53] brother Stewart.
[1:18:55] Now look,
[1:18:57] he said we he said God will bless you.
[1:19:00] We know it's possible to lose your first
[1:19:01] love. Do you know that?
[1:19:04] &gt;&gt; Your first love. What what do we say God
[1:19:07] first loved us?
[1:19:10] What is that first love? That first love
[1:19:12] is the strongest love that you've ever
[1:19:14] had. that beginning love.
[1:19:18] Brother Brandham said that the church in
[1:19:20] Revelation 2:4 says, "Nevertheless, I
[1:19:22] have somewhat against thee because I was
[1:19:23] left thy first love." That's the
[1:19:24] Ephesian church age. He said the church
[1:19:27] had lost their first love. He said the
[1:19:29] real cream that they had in the
[1:19:32] beginning. I won't hold you much longer,
[1:19:34] but listen to this. The real cream.
[1:19:37] &gt;&gt; I got thinking about that. My mind went
[1:19:40] back to milking a cow.
[1:19:44] And if you've ever milked cows, I milked
[1:19:47] cows by hand. I did that for years
[1:19:49] growing up. And we didn't learn much
[1:19:52] book knowledge, but we learned a lot
[1:19:53] about how to milk the cows and soft the
[1:19:56] hogs. And I milked this cow for years.
[1:19:58] And and I may not look much like it now,
[1:20:01] but we used to work hard, believe it or
[1:20:03] not. And uh uh we would we would I would
[1:20:07] milk this cow, and we had two cows. One
[1:20:09] of them was a Holene. If you know
[1:20:11] anything about cows, you know Holstein
[1:20:12] gives a real nice milk. A lot of milk
[1:20:15] because they've been bred for that. And
[1:20:16] then we had a Gernzie, half Gernzie,
[1:20:18] half Jersey mix. And a Jersey gives rich
[1:20:21] milk. Rich milk. In fact, a lot of
[1:20:23] people can't handle it. But I loved it.
[1:20:27] And what you did is you separated the
[1:20:29] milk from the cream.
[1:20:31] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:20:31] &gt;&gt; Right. Have you ever done that? Some of
[1:20:33] you elders have done that. Mom would
[1:20:34] take the milk and she'd separate that
[1:20:36] from the cream. But I wanted to shake it
[1:20:38] up.
[1:20:41] And if you got the Jersey milk, it's
[1:20:43] half cream.
[1:20:45] But the steward's looking at me like,
[1:20:46] "Where are you going with this?"
[1:20:49] Brother Brandon said, "They lost the
[1:20:51] real cream."
[1:20:53] &gt;&gt; And my mind went back to that because I
[1:20:54] it's hard to understand really what he's
[1:20:56] talking about, but the real cream,
[1:20:58] &gt;&gt; like there's nothing better than the
[1:21:00] real cream.
[1:21:01] &gt;&gt; If you've ever had cream in the milk,
[1:21:03] don't knock it until you tried it. If
[1:21:04] you've ever had raw milk that's that's
[1:21:07] got the cream in it out of a Jersey cow,
[1:21:09] you'll never go back.
[1:21:14] You talk about rich, buddy. That's the
[1:21:16] kind of love he wanted from his church.
[1:21:18] He wanted a rich love. Something that he
[1:21:20] could had some body to it. Something
[1:21:22] that could he could taste. Something he
[1:21:23] could Oh, God.
[1:21:26] some that made him sit on hard st rocks
[1:21:28] and and and meet in catacombs and and
[1:21:31] and praise him even though people had
[1:21:33] been killed that week and people have
[1:21:35] been fed to the lions and everything
[1:21:36] else yet they lifted their hands to him
[1:21:38] and worshiped just like we worship
[1:21:39] today.
[1:21:40] &gt;&gt; What was it? The real cream and oh God
[1:21:43] the real cream that they had at the
[1:21:44] beginning but as their churches got
[1:21:46] bigger and more comfortable and the and
[1:21:48] the and the hierarchy began to come in
[1:21:50] from the city the mayor started going
[1:21:51] there to church and things began to
[1:21:53] happen. What happened? and they lost the
[1:21:54] real cream. I pray we would never lose
[1:21:56] our first love. We would never lose the
[1:21:58] real cream.
[1:22:00] &gt;&gt; Once you've experienced that kind of
[1:22:02] love, you don't want to ever go back.
[1:22:03] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:22:06] &gt;&gt; Brother Brand said, "Ephesus was not a
[1:22:08] deceived church. It failed itself by not
[1:22:11] continuing in perfect love."
[1:22:13] He said, "You left that love you once
[1:22:15] had for them good oldfashioned Holy
[1:22:16] Ghost meetings." I've always I watched
[1:22:18] that with my kids. You know, kids just
[1:22:21] like us. They backslide. they get cold
[1:22:24] on God. Watch how they want to go to
[1:22:26] church. Especially as they get older. I
[1:22:28] know our little ones never want to go to
[1:22:29] church, but
[1:22:31] especially as they get older, if you get
[1:22:33] that that desire, you just kind of have
[1:22:34] to drag them when they're teenagers.
[1:22:36] There's something else going on. It's
[1:22:39] not just that they don't want to be in
[1:22:40] church. A lot of times there's something
[1:22:41] else going on. Why? They've lost that
[1:22:45] love.
[1:22:47] &gt;&gt; Huh?
[1:22:48] &gt;&gt; Lost that love. That's the time where
[1:22:49] they really need our prayers.
[1:22:52] &gt;&gt; Lost that love. that they used to have
[1:22:53] for good oldfashioned Holy Ghost
[1:22:54] meetings. They don't care about church
[1:22:57] anymore. Don't care about going to
[1:22:58] meetings. Don't care about about the
[1:22:59] people of God anymore. It's like bring
[1:23:01] back that love.
[1:23:04] &gt;&gt; You begin to kind of slide backwards
[1:23:05] that formal coming with our father
[1:23:07] nonsense.
[1:23:08] And he said, "My, I see you've left
[1:23:10] grace and faith and power to swap it for
[1:23:12] labor and works." Well, I tell you,
[1:23:14] brother Brandon, I help every widow
[1:23:15] woman I can. Well, that's a good thing.
[1:23:16] I commend you for that. But where's that
[1:23:17] first love you once had? Where's that
[1:23:19] joy you used to have? As David once
[1:23:21] cried, "Oh Lord, restore to me the joy
[1:23:23] of my salvation. Where's them all night
[1:23:25] prayer meetings and tears on your
[1:23:26] cheeks?" He said, "My goodness, the
[1:23:27] Bible's even dusty and got cobwebs on
[1:23:29] it. You read old love stories and news
[1:23:31] and things and things that ought be
[1:23:33] allowed to be published and put out for
[1:23:34] a trash can." And we Pentecostal people
[1:23:36] pick them up and just lost over them
[1:23:38] like a bunch of flies on a garbage can.
[1:23:42] &gt;&gt; You talk about a description. That's the
[1:23:44] way the internet is today. a bunch of
[1:23:45] stuff that shouldn't never be printed,
[1:23:48] &gt;&gt; right? And you're sitting there and
[1:23:49] people are consuming it like flies on a
[1:23:51] garbage can. That's right. Oh, mercy.
[1:23:53] All we need is back to our first love.
[1:23:56] Oh, church. You say, "Well, there's not
[1:23:57] very many people here, but Lord, take me
[1:23:59] back to my first love. Let me have
[1:24:01] revival kindled in my heart."
[1:24:03] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:24:04] &gt;&gt; Like never before.
[1:24:07] So, I'm closing with this. Luke chapter
[1:24:09] 15 speaks of a woman who lost a coin.
[1:24:12] She began to search diligently.
[1:24:15] sweeping every corner until she found
[1:24:17] it.
[1:24:18] Brother Brandham explained that. He said
[1:24:20] there was wedding coins in the second
[1:24:21] coming of the Lord. Brother Brandon
[1:24:22] preaches on that and he explains how
[1:24:24] that they had a a tablet on their head.
[1:24:26] He said there were virtues that a that a
[1:24:29] woman had. The very first one that he
[1:24:31] mentions was love,
[1:24:33] right? The very first one was love.
[1:24:36] She'd been faithful.
[1:24:38] She'd been faithful to her husband.
[1:24:40] She'd done everything she knew to do.
[1:24:42] But somehow that coin got loose and come
[1:24:45] out over time. Oh God, I believe you're
[1:24:48] we're church. We're we're believers here
[1:24:49] tonight. We're we're real Christians.
[1:24:51] But sometimes that coin gets a little
[1:24:53] loose
[1:24:55] &gt;&gt; and it come out and it was getting
[1:24:58] darker. He said it was right about
[1:24:59] nighttime and her husband was coming
[1:25:02] home and he would think that the priest
[1:25:05] had removed the coin cuz she'd given her
[1:25:08] love to somebody else cuz the the
[1:25:11] fullness of those virtues. Those coins
[1:25:13] represented something. It represented
[1:25:15] that she still had her virtue, still had
[1:25:17] her love for her husband. It was like a
[1:25:19] wedding band would be to us. And so she
[1:25:22] diligently searched. Can you imagine if
[1:25:26] you lost? Now, you know, I I notice once
[1:25:28] in a while if my wife's got her wedding
[1:25:30] band on, but my wife always notices if
[1:25:32] I've got mine on. And I have a a
[1:25:35] problem. I have to be able to do this.
[1:25:37] If I can't do that, I have to get a new
[1:25:38] wedding band. So, that's changed over
[1:25:40] the years, you know, and I'm wearing one
[1:25:42] now. Cost me $40. But but it's just big
[1:25:45] enough I can take it on or off like
[1:25:47] that. But she don't want it off. So,
[1:25:48] I've learned to leave it on. Why? Why?
[1:25:51] Cuz I belong to her and she wants the
[1:25:53] world to know that. Jesus wants the
[1:25:56] world to know that you belong to him.
[1:25:58] &gt;&gt; And when you lose your love for the
[1:26:00] house of God, when you lose your love
[1:26:02] for the people of God, when you make
[1:26:03] decisions that cause you to be far away
[1:26:05] uh from the people of God in the house
[1:26:07] of God church, I don't mean just
[1:26:08] naturally. I mean far away in your
[1:26:10] heart.
[1:26:12] &gt;&gt; When you do those things, what happens?
[1:26:15] What happens? You find that when you
[1:26:18] recognize what it is that he loves you
[1:26:20] so much, you begin to diligently search
[1:26:23] with a candle and a broom. He said, "A
[1:26:25] c, oh my, a candle and a broom. A candle
[1:26:27] to shed light on every area of her house
[1:26:29] and a broom to get rid of what was
[1:26:30] wrong." And she goes through the house
[1:26:32] just a sweeping as hard as she could
[1:26:33] sweep. Dust flying out the windows. Why?
[1:26:36] She's looking for something that she
[1:26:38] lost. That's what we need is we know
[1:26:40] we're elected. We know we're
[1:26:41] predestined. But we don't want to be
[1:26:43] found without our love. Amen.
[1:26:46] &gt;&gt; The coin was so precious, precious love.
[1:26:51] Let's turn it around.
[1:26:53] We know when brother when Jesus gave
[1:26:55] that parable, he talked about the lost
[1:26:56] sheep and then he talked about the woman
[1:26:58] who lost the coin.
[1:27:00] You were that lost coin.
[1:27:04] If you think about it from God's
[1:27:05] perspective, he diligently came looking
[1:27:08] for you.
[1:27:11] As a song, he came looking for me when I
[1:27:13] could not come to where he was. He came
[1:27:16] looking for me.
[1:27:18] And that coin was so precious. You were
[1:27:20] so precious to him that he sent men like
[1:27:22] brother Biscll.
[1:27:24] And I thought today as I was listening
[1:27:26] to the man preach, you know, maybe
[1:27:28] that'll strike some heart. They'll go to
[1:27:30] a nominal church.
[1:27:32] Maybe that's a seed of God
[1:27:34] and they'll go for a while and it just
[1:27:36] be something they just not they're still
[1:27:37] hungry for something. And maybe God will
[1:27:40] use that to bring them to a nominal
[1:27:43] church. And then maybe they'll come
[1:27:44] across the message of the hour because
[1:27:46] men like brother Biscll and others I
[1:27:47] don't want to just call talk about him
[1:27:49] but he just passed away. Others who've
[1:27:50] went remember what they told brother
[1:27:52] Brandon when they were behind the
[1:27:53] curtain of time. They said if you hadn't
[1:27:55] went we wouldn't be here.
[1:27:57] &gt;&gt; God didn't just predestinate the people.
[1:27:59] He predestinated a ministry to catch
[1:28:01] those people.
[1:28:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. He said behold I send you Elijah
[1:28:06] the prophet. Then if he's sending for
[1:28:08] me, brother Stern, he's sitting for all
[1:28:10] the elect. I don't know who the elect
[1:28:11] is. So let me spread my net wide. Let me
[1:28:14] catch as many as I can catch.
[1:28:17] &gt;&gt; Let me be one who sweeps the house
[1:28:20] looking for that last one. Cuz when the
[1:28:22] last one comes in, we'll be gone.
[1:28:26] In this age when the love of the
[1:28:28] majority as Peter comes and the
[1:28:30] musicians when the love of the majority
[1:28:31] has slowly gotten colder and colder,
[1:28:36] may our love for him and one another
[1:28:39] grow stronger every day. Let the cream
[1:28:44] be fresh.
[1:28:46] I I can't describe to you if you've
[1:28:48] never drank that. You just say, "Man,
[1:28:50] that's good.
[1:28:53] I can still taste it. It's fresh.
[1:28:58] I don't want to ever get stale.
[1:29:01] I don't want to ever get cold.
[1:29:04] I want the cream to be fresh in my life.
[1:29:08] I don't want to take the people for
[1:29:09] granted. I don't want to take the desire
[1:29:11] I have to serve God for granted because
[1:29:13] it could leave.
[1:29:15] You lose your love for the people and
[1:29:17] bad things begin to happen. I don't want
[1:29:18] to do that.
[1:29:21] It's a precious love.
[1:29:23] It's the love of God that constrains us.
[1:29:26] Not our own love, but the love of God
[1:29:28] that constrains us to love one another,
[1:29:31] even when we're unlovable sometimes. And
[1:29:33] yet, we love because it's the love of
[1:29:34] God beyond our own thinking, beyond our
[1:29:37] own feelings, beyond what we think. Oh,
[1:29:40] could you experience that kind of love?
[1:29:41] A rare love. If you got a husband that
[1:29:43] loves you or wife that loves you in
[1:29:45] spite of everything, you know that that
[1:29:47] love can never be broken. If you're
[1:29:49] sick, if you're not feeling well, no
[1:29:50] matter what happened, no matter no
[1:29:52] matter what would happen, you know, they
[1:29:54] would never forsake you. They would know
[1:29:56] God. Oh, that that's such a precious
[1:29:58] thing. You ought to thank God for that.
[1:29:59] Then how much should we thank him that
[1:30:02] he came and found us and there's nothing
[1:30:04] we could do to lose that love in our
[1:30:06] lives. There's nothing he loves us
[1:30:08] first. Oh, we may lose our love for him.
[1:30:11] It may grow cold, but he will not lose
[1:30:13] his love for us. And he will put his
[1:30:16] love in us if we allow him to do it.
[1:30:19] Don't take it for granted, church. It's
[1:30:21] precious love.
[1:30:23] Oh, so I want to worship him when I come
[1:30:25] to church. I'll just say this about our
[1:30:28] worship services. It's been real sweet,
[1:30:29] hasn't it been lately? It's a precious
[1:30:32] sense of the presence of God in the
[1:30:34] building. Let's never lose that.
[1:30:38] Said, "Brother Ben, you're trying to
[1:30:39] work people." No, it's during these
[1:30:41] times when sons are born, daughters are
[1:30:43] born in the house of God. It's during
[1:30:45] these moments when we worship and we
[1:30:47] give up all of our self and every
[1:30:48] thought of ourel and every thought of
[1:30:50] the world and say Lord change me make me
[1:30:53] new in those moments of refreshing as
[1:30:55] brother Brandon talked about going in at
[1:30:56] night time coming out with the dew
[1:30:58] falling oh may it be so in every service
[1:31:00] that we have I don't want to ever lose
[1:31:02] my desire to worship God with everything
[1:31:05] that I've got I may be going through
[1:31:07] hell but let me lift my hands and praise
[1:31:09] God because I know he won't leave me
[1:31:11] there he said I will not leave his soul
[1:31:13] in hell or suffer his a holy one to see
[1:31:15] corruption and I'm a part of that body.
[1:31:17] If he went to hell for me, I don't I
[1:31:20] won't stay even in the hell of this
[1:31:22] earth. I will. He will not leave me
[1:31:23] here, but he's coming to get me. Aren't
[1:31:25] you glad for that today? Aren't you glad
[1:31:27] he's coming for you? Hallelujah. Don't
[1:31:30] take it for granted. His love is
[1:31:32] precious love. Heavenly Father, our
[1:31:35] Jesus, I thank you for allowing me to
[1:31:37] speak today. And I pray that I got out
[1:31:39] of the way enough.
[1:31:42] Oh God, every service I second guess and
[1:31:45] think, what I I should have said that as
[1:31:48] I heard your prophets talk about it. He
[1:31:49] said, "We know there's lost people there
[1:31:51] and when they turn it down sometimes and
[1:31:54] criticize it, it makes you just feel so
[1:31:55] awful." But Lord, I pray that the word
[1:31:59] would find a resting place in every
[1:32:00] heart. Lord, that enough was said
[1:32:03] through lifts of clay that people would
[1:32:05] know uh that they need to search
[1:32:08] diligently
[1:32:09] if they've lost that love to find him.
[1:32:12] Pray you'd grant it. Oh God, we thank
[1:32:15] you for coming and searching diligently
[1:32:17] for us. And crying as you did in the
[1:32:20] garden, Adam, Adam, where art thou?
[1:32:23] Oh, we hear your voice tonight. We feel
[1:32:25] your pull. We thank you for it, Lord.
[1:32:29] Pray you just move over our
[1:32:30] congregation.
[1:32:32] Lord, you're doing something here. We
[1:32:34] may not see the fruit of it in every
[1:32:36] service or every day or every moment,
[1:32:38] but Lord, overall, I see a fruit of your
[1:32:41] presence. And Lord, of a maturing of the
[1:32:44] body, Lord, young people that love one
[1:32:46] another and older folks that love one
[1:32:48] another, I pray it would continue. Lord,
[1:32:51] may we we take these shields that you've
[1:32:53] given us and quench every fiery dart of
[1:32:56] the enemy. Lord, take the sword that
[1:32:59] you've given us, Lord, the sword of the
[1:33:01] word and fight through every Philistine.
[1:33:03] But we can get you a fresh drink of
[1:33:05] water, Pentecostal water. Oh, we thank
[1:33:08] you for it, Lord. We love you and we we
[1:33:11] just want to thank you for coming down
[1:33:12] among us today. Thank you for this time
[1:33:14] we spend in your presence
[1:33:17] in Jesus name. Hallelujah.
[1:33:21] Now, let's just worship him a minute.
[1:33:23] It's not very late.
[1:33:25] Just let's just worship him. Let's just
[1:33:27] give him our all for just a minute
[1:33:28] before we go. We're already here. We
[1:33:30] might as well worship him. Singing now.
[1:33:33] Oh yes.
[1:33:35] All my life you have been faithful.
[1:33:40] &gt;&gt; Oh yes. Could we stand together and
[1:33:42] singing? All my life you have been so so
[1:33:48] good.
[1:33:49] Yes. Oh, with every breath that I am
[1:33:54] able.

[1:33:59] of the goodness of God.
[1:34:03] Sing the verse now. I love you, Lord.
[1:34:07] Oh, do you love him? For your mercy
[1:34:10] never fails me.

[1:34:16] I've been held in your hand.
[1:34:20] &gt;&gt; Oh, singing now. From the moment that I
[1:34:23] wake up, oh till I lay my hand,
[1:34:30] I will sing

[1:34:43] Lord Jesus. Thank you for your
[1:34:45] faithfulness. Great is thy faithfulness.

[1:35:00] &gt;&gt; Oh I will sing
[1:35:03] of the goodness of God.
[1:35:07] Oh I love your voice.
[1:35:11] Oh, you have led me through the fire.
[1:35:16] &gt;&gt; Oh, just sing it to him now.
[1:35:18] &gt;&gt; Oh, I thank you for your voice, Lord.
[1:35:23] &gt;&gt; Oh,
[1:35:25] I've known you as a father.
[1:35:28] Oh, I've known you as a friend.
[1:35:33] Oh, I have lived in the goodness
[1:35:38] of God. singing now. All my life, oh,
[1:35:43] all my life you have been faithful.
[1:35:47] Oh, so glad for your faithfulness, Lord.
[1:35:50] All my life you have been so so good.

[1:36:06] of the goodness
[1:36:08] of God. Let's sing that bridge now. Oh

[1:36:28] down. I surrender now. I give you
[1:36:32] everything.

[1:36:38] running after me. Sing it now. All my
[1:36:42] life, all my life, everything.
[1:36:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.

[1:36:52] have been so so good. With every breath,

[1:37:11] the chorus rather. Oh my life you have
[1:37:15] been faithful.

[1:44:24] There are two roads
[1:44:28] you may take.
[1:44:32] Lord by side,
[1:44:36] one by faith.
[1:44:40] Take the word of God.
[1:44:43] For what you see,
[1:44:47] what you believe
[1:44:50] is what will be.
[1:44:54] So set your wings
[1:44:58] to the winds of faith.
[1:45:01] You can fly
[1:45:05] in a higher place.
[1:45:09] Do not struggle.
[1:45:13] It's by grace.
[1:45:17] Set your wings
[1:45:20] to the winds of faith.
[1:45:24] Watch your need.
[1:45:28] Watch your cry.
[1:45:32] Watch your mountain.
[1:45:35] Much to high.
[1:45:39] Speak the word of God.
[1:45:42] And by and by
[1:45:46] it we will move
[1:45:50] for you will fly
[1:45:53] so your wings
[1:45:57] to the wind of faith
[1:46:02] can fly
[1:46:04] in a higher place.
[1:46:09] Do not trouble.
[1:46:12] It's by grace
[1:46:16] set your wings
[1:46:19] to the wind. Let's try that first verse.
