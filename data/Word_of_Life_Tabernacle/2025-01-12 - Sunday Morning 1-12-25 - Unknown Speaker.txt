know you love or you wouldn't get out in the weather and the cold and and it's always good to see people that'll that'll Brave the weather conditions and and come to church good to see some of the folks from Christian Tabernacle here enjoyed that song sister Grace I didn't realize your brother was such a good piano player but my goodness he is he is really becoming a good pianist so that's that's wonderful me Acts chapter 20 and verse 19 serving the Lord with all humility of mind and with many tears and Temptations which befell me by the lying in weight of the Jews and how I kept back nothing that was profitable unto you but have showed you and have taught you publicly and from house to house 21 testifying both to the Jews and also to the Greeks repentance towards God and Faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ and now behold I go Bound in the spirit unto Jerusalem not knowing the things that shall befall me there save that the Holy Ghost witnesseth in every city St saying that bonds and afflictions abide me and I like this verse and we want to kind of dwell here today but none of these things move me neither count I my life dear un myself so that I might finish my course with joy and the ministry which I have received of the Lord Jesus to testify the gospel of the grace of God you may be seated may the Lord add His blessings to the reading this morning if I could title this sermon this morning I would like to ask a question what is our absolute our absolute and so with that in mind I was taking this scripture here brother Brandon preaches several sermons on an absolute an absolute a absolute absolute I think there might be four actually or five of those sermons that he preaches and I've went through several of them to kind of get an idea of what was brother branham's absolute because many today in the message will say things like brother brandham is my absolute they'll say the message my is my absolute and you may even have someone say my pastor is my absolute' and maybe you would even have someone say that um my boss is my absolute there's all kinds of absolutes everyone has an absolute how many knows that to be true all right wake up and help me out if you can so we all have an absolute and every one of us are subject or we we we have something above us we are not the final say in anything and if you're looking to a man to be your absolute I would say you're looking at uh you're looking at at a at a at a something that can fail you because at the end of the day a human being as your absolute is not going to it's just not going to work out long term because that man will fail you in some way I don't care how good he is I don't care if he's a prophet I don't care who he is that man will fail you if he is your absolute now we'll get to something and stay with me if I lose you on that just stay with me we'll get we'll get around to uh maybe you'll agree with me when he says it himself now uh brother brandom says this to lay a foundation he calls it his foundation in one of the absolute sermons so I'm going to try to go through it just a little bit and he says now absolutes we're talking absolute you know our Supreme Court is an absolute we all know that just as a natural absolute if uh you can run a bill by Congress you can run a bill by the Senate you can run a bill you can have everything passed and then of course there's an absolute for that it's got to go to the president's desk and uh our president wouldn't know if he signed it or not but uh if it made it to his desk at least it would be in the front of an absolute the facts are that man is still an absolute and so uh and the next one will be an absolute and he'll make mistakes why because he's a man that's right and so I don't care who you put in there there'll be an absolute that has to make decisions and the decision they make may not be the right decision so your absolute that you're putting all your trust in could actually make a mistake is that okay so that's just in the natural so brother Brandon would go on down he said but there's an absolute certainly is why that's our nation is tied to that he said when that Supreme Court finally makes their final decision that's it there's no further where you going to go after that he said you're going to follow their decision and that's all you've got to they're the last word they're the amen he calls it and so we find that that's just the truth and so many times you'll see something that'll be real controversial it'll go through a court a lower court and then it'll go to the higher courts then finally it'll end up in the Supreme Court and then they have to make a decision on that you don't always agree with their decisions but there's a group on there and they the majority rules and and it's the same way in church you know there's a reason we had church today because of the majority of the deacon board says we're going to have church today and so when they say that that's the absolute and so me or nobody else can change that and so what we do is we have to have that listen church we have to have an authority we have to submit ourselves to an authority and I I don't mean to go slow this morning but I want to get this in and then I'll try to preach to you is that okay and so we have to have an authority if we don't have an authority on something then there's no Authority on the way we dress then there's no Authority on the way we have church and there's no Authority on the way we have Sunday school there's no Authority on the way that we preach the gospel there has to be an authority on all these things and we call that an absolute and so brother Rand would go on and he said we have to have an absolute everybody has to have one you got one but what I'm trying to tell you he said to background here and show you what absolutes are he said now the nation's Supreme Court is the nation's absolute that's the last thing any kind of a fuss they settle it what they say that's it there is an absolute at a ball game anybody ever been to a ball game nobody puts their hands up that's funny some of y'all been to ball games and if you've been to a ball game all the kids back there are being honest and so if you've been to an a ball game if you go to a baseball game you have an Umpire brother brandom calls them an Empire but they're an Umpire so you go to you go to a ball game and there's an Umpire and I guarantee you if your favorite team has a call go against them you disagree with the Umpire but if it's a call in favor of your team you don't seem to care what the Umpire says he's your absolute then we believe he's our absolute listen to what the Umpire says why because it's in your favor and it's a lot easier to agree with the absolute when it's something you like right it's a whole lot easier to agree with an absolute when they are judging in your favor so if if your favorite ball team is still playing and the referees if they're maybe they're paid off if they're reing the Chiefs and so they sorry had to throw that in there to see if brother Ben's watching but they uh they if your referees usually if you're on the opposing team then you're going to complain about the refs I do nobody else okay I don't watch football but yeah sometimes but you know basketball gamees the same way you know they they could they could they could rule something that's absolutely you're sitting there on on watching on TV or in the game and oh that man is he he's just not right it doesn't really matter what you think sitting in the top in the bleachers because what the absolute says goes now I'm trying to build a foundation here I hope this is okay but brother Brandon would talk about the Umpire of the ball game he said now he said sometimes we don't like his decision either but it's that way anyhow the Umpire his decision is the final word that's right no brother Ben said that may be false teaching sorry he said there is an absolute at a ball game that's the Umpire he said oh yeah some sometimes we don't like his decision either but anyhow the Umpire his decision is the final word that's right no matter what others says if it's a strike it's a strike whatever the Umpire says goes now he also has a boss and I think they put him up in New York or somewhere in an office and then they're also they have a replay review or whatever they've got now and they've messed the game up because they've tried to take the absolute away from the absolute and so then they have somebody else that tries to correct the absolute and it's just a never ending cycle but somebody has the final word I hope you're with me so far I I just want to lay this in here real simple and then we'll go somewhere else he said now there is an absolute now he said that's right certainly no matter what others say that that that don't have nothing to do with it so if you're at a ball game and you get mad at the Umpire or you get mad at the referee and you're up there screaming and and and acting a fool uh get kicked out of the game or something like that the facts are you just don't have no thought coming and you can scream you can yell and it's not going to change mind if anything you're going to make them mad and they might throw you out and they have the authority to do that brother brandom goes on and he says no matter what the others say and he says I don't go to ball games but just happen to jot that down an Umpire he's the absolute at the ball game one of them say that was a ball the other one say you're a liar just imagine and he said this is that way and you ought to be this way and the Umpire said strike see the rest of them take their seat and sit down it gripes them some but I imagine they'd Boo at him there down in their heart and things but it's a strike anyhow why he's the final word and the first baseman said you know that that passed and the other one say you know he said that's this and that's that it's that's a strike and he said well shut up then go back to your place what if there wasn't an Umpire at a ball game what if there wasn't an absolute if there was no absolute he said he said you'd have one another you're a liar and there'd be a fuss and he said to have a ball game you've got to have an absolute and he walks out there and no matter if you don't like him or what he's the absolute anyhow he is the absolute his word is f no matter what you say about it it's that way now he said if they didn't the whole game would go into chaos is that right now I want you to just think spiritual for a moment if we didn't have an absolute what would we have what would we tie ourselves to this morning what would we even think or what would we believe what would we you know every every group I would just like to say it like this every denomination has an absolute and some of them are some of them are all different things and you might have a you might have a group of men that's an absolute for this group and the majority of those men would vote a certain way and then all their preachers have to dress a certain way or act a certain way or say a certain thing or have to go to Seminary so long and all these things and you just think about it everyone's got an absolute and everyone even if they say well I don't have an absolute I'm just living my own life well you've got an absolute and so everyone's got one every church every denomination every message church every message person every mother every father every child everyone has an absolute and so brother brandham goes on down he said You' got to have somebody that the game is tied to and that's the Umpire he says when it's strike it's strike if he says ball it's ball whatever he says it goes that's it and if you didn't you wouldn't have no game he said let me show you another absolute is the red light aren't you glad for red lights and he said when it says stop it means stop now I wonder how many times we look at a red light and we just get irritated that it's there because it seems like there's no purpose but if you take it away you know before they put it there they probably thought there's a reason for the red light and I know there's a stop sign in there yall know what I'm talking about there's a stop sign in there that has no purpose and we'll just leave it there but somebody that had an absolute right to put it there put it there and now if you run that stoplight they can still give you a ticket or stop sign they can still give you a ticket why because they have an absolute right to do it because somebody had an absolute right to put the stop sign in a stupid place you can argue with the cop but he'd say there's a stop sign there and that's an absolute and you got to stop brother Brandon would go on down I know this is really simple and some of you are bored to death already and that's okay because we're going to get somewhere he said what kind of a city would it be without stop lights it's got to have an absolute I don't care what the policeman said or anybody else said standing there they're secondary if somebody can prove that you went through on a green light I don't care what the policeman said they're wrong when the light said go that means go that's an absolute you can prove that and the light said go go the policeman might have been standing somewhere the mayor of the city might have been standing there and said you had to stop but they don't have any authority over the stoplight right now he said he said you might have somebody out there saying hey get out of the way I'm in a hurry I got to go to work I'm late now I'm going through now the other one said you just think you are because I'm the one that's going this is without a stoplight and he said you just have everywhere he said you'd have a woman get out and fix her hair what if we didn't have a red light can you just imagine now I've seen them set at a red light and and I don't know what they're doing but they pull their mirror down and they're doing something when they're fixing their makeup or whatever it is and it turns green and you sit there for a few seconds before you decide you better honk the horn and you get you get irritated anybody ever done that anybody ever done that on the way to church not just me all right Pentecostal cussing or cursing or whatever they call it but you honk your horn at them because they're sitting there and they're distracted some people get on their phone and they get distracted but when the light says go you go and the people behind you have a right to honk their horn at you if you didn't go and so he said let's go brother he said he said you go on down here he said that's far enough he said when the stoplight says stop that's stop that's right he said then where where are where we are based upon is that word not on what some bunch of men said or some other bunch of men said Jesus said these signs shall follow them that believe let's go into all the world preach the gospel to Every Creature he said you know as good as education is but Jesus never required that he said as good as churches are buildings he never required that as good as hospitals was he was he said the the churches build hospitals that was right that's all right he said we appreciate that but he never required it and he said to the church preach the gospel that's an absolute he said the gospel came not in word only but through some p through Power and manifestation of the word and Paul said then go manifest the gospel he said oh my if it was that way what are we today living in a time when we got the best doctors we ever had we got the best drugs we ever practiced with he said you know that we salute those men we pray for them he said and I do and I hope you do those men who with their understanding or feeling they got two senses to work by and that's seeing and feeling and he said and and then they have hearing and he said they work by a sound of a heart or a feeling of a tumor or something or the sight of something they can see the spread of a disease or something on the face that's covering the face or the body somewhere and they work upon these things he said why because they try to take medicines and so much that it will kill it and he said and then it won't kill you and so forth and that's their business to work on that and we appreciate that that's very fine but we got the best doctors the best medicine the best hospitals and more sickness than we ever had and he said we got more unbelief than we ever had he said yes sir exactly ministers has organized themselves and got great denominations and taking and anything and so forth and just anything making the church he said he said making a church member and they went over to some Seminary like an incubator chicken and hatch them out by a grinder and brings him out like that and he said and sometimes know no more about God than a hot and tot does about Egyptian night and brings him through like that and there you are see he said oh what we need in our churches is a man that's got an absolute and I would say what we need this morning is not someone who is tossed to and fro by every wind of Doctrine but you can have an absolute and so this morning if you have an absolute you can point to the absolute and you can say it doesn't matter how I feel it doesn't matter what I think but I'm pointing to an absolute and so this morning if you've been diagnosed with cancer we have an absolute that says by his stripes we are healed amen if the doctor has told you you couldn't have children sister Millie you can point to an absolute that says all things are possible to them that believe and I would like to say this morning if you can have faith in God then your absolute is in the word of God and everything he says is your absolute we don't need an absolute that tries to put gloom and doom over our lives we need an absolute that will show the promises over the church we we don't need an absolute that tries to tell us that we don't need to go to church anymore because the Bible said that we must assemble ourselves together and that much more as we see the day approaching so what is our absolute what a man said or what the word said and so if a man would come or an angel from heaven would come and say something to you that would be outside of the word then you can let him be a cursed and let the word be your absolute amen so what is our absolute today we've had all kinds of absolutes come through in our day and try to tell you that uh that that there's a coming that there's a the coming of a prophet that's going to return and he's going to come back in a tent and he's going to preach the Mysteries but what did the Bible say about it in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mysteries of God would be finished and if the absolute says it then I believe what the absolute says I don't care what nobody else tries to tell me I believe my absolute is the word of God and so if someone tries to tell you there's a new way to have church I can point you back to a prophet and say that the message of the hour is my absolute amen somebody else could say well my absolute is not the message well the messenger's absolute was the word of God and if he said what Paul said then I'm okay saying with what he said why because what he said I'm going to hold to it because what he said is exactly what Paul taught and I'm resting on that because I'm in The Bride of Jesus Christ now he said if you in your life if you have an absolute you do things ordinarily you would not do because you're led by seeing feeling and believing and you're and you've got touch you've got sight you've got all these things that you're led by and you have to be led by something but really you have an ultimate so you could see something doesn't mean that it's right you could feel something but doesn't mean that it's right you could even uh you could even look at the word in the Bible and look through of eyes that have been bound or eyes that have not been opened and you could actually look at the word many people do in this day and you could actually have people that could look at this same Bible you look at and and believe that we should be baptized in the name of father and the son of the Holy Ghost and you they could read the same words you did what is it it is that their eyes have not been open so they don't actually have an absolute but their absolute is what a church told them the Bible meant but they don't have an absolute in the word itself they can't look to the word and say my denomination's wrong they can't look to the word and say my church is wrong listen your pastor is not your absolute I am not your absolute the deacons they're an absolute in some ways there's decision they make that are absolute but they are not your absolute when it comes to the word and man I could disagree with the deacons doctrinally and that doesn't mean I'm right and it doesn't mean they're right but what is right is the word is that okay and so you can have an absolute and you could be wrong in your absolute absolutely my background would say brother randoms are absolute and if he walked across the street a certain way we had to walk across the street a certain way if he hunted with a certain gun you had to hunt with a certain gun y'all got real quiet some of you in here they may be watching I don't care some people will elevate a man to status of absolute and while I respect the man and I'll follow the man's opinions over your opinion or my opinion he was a man that's and you don't ever make a man your absolute amen but I want to show you something that John many Look to Him and they would look to John and they would say well are you not the Messiah are you not the one that was to come no I'm just one here standing pointing to the one is to come and so he was not the Christ he was not the Messiah but he was pointing to an absolute and so I want to just point you to a man who said it's not me it's him it's not me doing the works but it's the one standing right here with me on the form now he's the one doing the works listen Church we're not following a man that said look to me as your absolute he's look he said look to me and follow me as I follow Christ and he he said look to me as your brother I'm your brother I don't have any power I don't have any Authority but he is the one that's got to come down and do these things brother brandom didn't have no right to heal you but he was standing in the presence of the one who had the full authority to heal you and I want to just go ahead and tell you today I don't have the authority to pray for you I don't have the authority to heal you but if he's here and I can lay my hands on the sick according to my absolute and you can be healed I have an absolute he had an absolute the word is our absolute right I don't have a problem with saying the message is my absolute right but I do have a problem when you say that the messenger is your absolute and you deny what the messenger said because you're elevating a man above the message that he brought and that is is completely contrary to what the messenger said I hope this is okay this morning I'll get in trouble but that's okay we won't be the first time brother brandom said especially if you have a god- center life he said you'll do things ordinarily you would not if you have an absolute he said especially if you have a god- centered life the god- centered life makes a person do things that ordinarily they would not do very odd peculiar why is a Christian life so odd and peculiar is because that they are looking to God's word which is almost foreign to the world today now you you look at a message church and you wonder why we dress the way we do when we don't technically have a book that you come in and you sign up and you take a book and you say well I'm going to wear dresses to church and I'm going to I'm not going to wear makeup and I'm not going to do this I'm all these you just don't have a a list of rules that you get when you join the church or come to the church and you wonder so why do they all dress modest because of an absolute that we all have right and so our absolute if you look in the book of Timothy there I believe it's first Timothy you talk you look at a woman's long hair long dress and and you can look at that as your absolute and you say well why does the world not dress like that if they also say they believe the same Bible we do it's because the Bible is not their absolute it is not their TI poost it is not what they're looking to to know how to dress what they're looking to is well so and so could wear pants I can wear pants so and so cut their hair or just trimmed it a little bit I can trim mine the Bible says you can't what is your absolute the Bible says to not wear garments that pertain to a man and you say well other women do it so your absolute becomes someone else instead of the Bible we don't have to have church anymore because our leaders said that we can stay home what does the word say the Bible tells us if an angel from heaven teaches anything different than what's already been preach let him be a cursed so I would say this morning that if there's someone in your life that is influencing you take it back to the word if it's influencing your dress take it back to the word if it's influencing your ability to go to church take it back to the word amen many men can rise up and say this is the truth and that's the truth but take it back to the word why because that is our absolute and our absolute we've got to tie our souls to it church we can't look around and say well I want to follow so and so I want to do what this church does no every church is Sovereign every local church is Sovereign and there's a reason why they do the things that they do they have an absolute we have an absolute and I want to say this morning it's more than my opinion it's more than what I see in the scripture but my soul is tied to the absolute there's nothing I can do to change the way I am because I'm my soul so I'm not going to dress according to the world I'm not going to get on any skinny jeans and that would look really bad and look like some sister ified Punk the faces on the front row are wonderful because my absolute is not the trend of the world my absolute is not what they're the cool kid in school is not your absolute the cool kid in school is just doing something he saw somebody else do and the I mean come on somebody I mean you know we're always looking peer pressure is a really bad thing sometimes because we're looking to PE people to know how to worship we're looking at people to know how to dress we're looking at people to know how to attend church well if they can miss church I can miss church all y'all that are streaming this morning I'm not preaching at you because you couldn't get out of your driveway listen I I I I thank the Lord there's people that still have a desire to go to church if they didn't why would you have a church building and so I do thank the Lord for that those that have a desire to be in church we have an absolute on that and my opinion of going to church doesn't really matter my opinion of going to church won't save you uh at times I've been told I'm a little bit legalistic on it I am I'll admit that I'm a little legalist I was raised that way I never miss church that's just the way I am but that doesn't mean if somebody misses Church they're going to hell for it you have an absolute I have an absolute and what we're doing is lining up to our absolute not to each other well brother Joel never misses so that puts pressure on me to go it doesn't really matter if brother Joel never misses somebody said amen in the back oh let me just go ahead and tell you something what I do brother Danny sometimes you just don't want to do because I am a human and I know you all know this by now amen everybody knows I'm human everybody knows I'm going to make mistakes everybody knows your pastor could make a mistake everybody knows you could make a mistake your husband your wife your children all of you are subject to mistakes because you're human come on now but let me just go ahead and ask you the question what about our Prophet was he human so I want to read this quote because I think this will put it in perspective for you brother Ram said what I'm trying to say don't never lose your confidence don't let Satan tell you evil about me cuz there's much is this okay he said but you keep that confidence CU if you don't it won't happen don't look to me as a man I'm a man I'm full of mistakes but look to what I'm saying about him it's him he is the one and so I want you to notice in the same quote where he's saying don't look to me I'm a man he's also saying don't lose your confidence so don't look at the mistakes of the man look at the word that he brought don't look at the mistakes of a man and mean your pastor is going to make mistakes your pastor is going to make decisions that you're not going to like I may make a decision that you don't like the deacons might make a decision you don't like but you don't look look to them as men look to your absolute which is the word of God Amen look to the message that he brought not the messenger the messenger could fail you the messenger could tell a lie he told us he could the messenger could even say things that that you know that he would come back and correct himself on tape amen he said don't look to me Look to Him am right amen so I will say today the message is my absolute amen the message is my absolute because the messenger was man enough to tell me that it wasn't him it was Christ amen if he would have come and said look at me I'm your absolute then I could have looked to the scriptures and said prophets never acted that way but because he came in a humble way because he came in humility and said don't look to me I'm your brother then I can follow a man like that because he is fully surrendered and following the word himself right so you follow a pastor but you don't look at his mistakes because the minute you start looking at the mistakes you'll find a lot of things to criticize the moment you start looking at my mistakes you'll start finding a whole lot of things to criticize and you might even be right in that and I can look at you and we can do the same thing we can sit here and have a critics Fest to where we just criticize each other and we could do that all day long and we would never run out of content or or or or material to work with we would have all day all night and into next year and we could still be sitting here criticizing each other and finding fault with one another and we could do that and we could probably justify ourselves in doing that is that okay the truth is that's just that's just the way life is that's just the way humans like to act humans like to criticize one another but if you're looking for for something to criticize you'll find something to criticize if you came to church this morning and you had something in your heart against somebody you're going to go to church you're not going to get nothing out of church you're going to sit there with your critical spirit and criticize somebody in the church because they did something you didn't like and let me go ahead and just tell you something you did something they didn't like but we all have an absolute so my absolute may not be brother Jared although he may we could we could both be going to go do something and he could say to do it this way and I could say to do it this way and I could think there's no way he's right and in the end he could be right and I could be wrong imagine that the truth of it is as a human being you're going to make a mistake if you haven't already made one today and so we find that every one of us if I'm looking to brother Stewart as my absolute he's going to fail me as much as confidence as I have in the man he's going to fail me and I can look to brother Danny who's been been a pillar in the church for a whole long time I could look to that man and if I followed him around and knew every thought knew every action of his entire life I could say the man has got a he's got faults I know you don't believe me but it's just true because he's human right some of y'all you got these Halos on your head and you're like well I don't make mistakes that's your first mistake yeah is this okay I have just went completely off the rails here but here I am so far off my notes Lord help me but we all have an absolute brother BR stays on this is the messenger the messenger your absolute he I I gu several quotes on this he says friends don't look to me I'm your brother don't pay no attention to me because I'm just IM mortal I have to die like everybody else don't you listen to me but listen to what I've said what I said is the message now there's where I can stand and say the message is my absolute because a prophet said don't look to me don't listen to me but he said listen to what I've said what I said is the message now I want you to notice something there I know this would get me in all kinds of trouble Lord help me but that don't even mean you've got to listen to every jot and tit that he said if brother brandom stuttered and said and and that was not thus sayeth the Lord right right because he was a a human yes God took a man that was humble God took a man with a a seventh grade education and made raised him up to pray for kings and monarchs and and he and he made him a great man but it wasn't because the man was great God made the man great God raised him up to be what he was see if we ever get our Focus off of who he is we start elevating men to positions that they're not allowed to be in and then the next thing you know we start looking at the man and when he makes a mistake we fall away why because our eyes were looking to something we should have never been looking at right because a man could fail you in the worst possible way a woman can fail you in the worst possible way but if you look to him he cannot let you down your marriage can fail you your church can fail you everybody can fail you but he can never fail right so that's why we don't pay any attention he said don't pay any attention to the messenger watch the message keep your eyes not on the messenger but look on the message what it said that's the thing to look to now what did the message tell us how do you know so let's just go there we're here if the messenger told us a certain way to have tongues and interpretation of the church that's my absolute your opinion's good but that's my absolute and and and so I'm going to take that over what you think why because you weren't Vindicated last I checked you didn't have a picture with with the angel of the Lord over your head that's right was it vindicating the man or the message right on now that's the question it was vindicating a man who brought the message so brother Brandon would make a statement and I didn't bring the quote but I'll just say this and you can go look it up he said he said the message and the messenger are are are one and the same or they're always the same he said you can't separate the man and the message now many people have taken that and they've run with it and they've taken it completely out of context and they'll say that well if the message is my absolute then the man's my absolute and that's not even what he's saying you can't separate the two because God predestinated a certain man to bring a certain message nobody else could bring Paul's message but Paul nobody else could bring this message but William brandham and so am I looking to him yes because he pointed me to him this is just really really strong on my heart today I wonder if sometimes we don't get our eyes I I want to just this is kind of why this came to me there's a group of people that have or someone has has has put a a magazine out and it's questioning the message and it's got the followers in there and all their mistakes and and and listen church if you're looking at mistakes in this message you're going to find them because the message is full of humans too the mistakes are not in the word it's with the people that's right and so when you see these things that are criticizing brother Brandon for for for l money I I love that one because it's just stupid the man lived humble he never made it about himself he didn't live he didn't build a huge Cathedral he didn't live in a fancy house he lived comfortably but he did not have any more than any other minister in the church at churches at that time he was not a man that that that made himself bigger than he was and so I love the humility of a prophet how about you one of the reasons I'm I'm so attracted to the man himself is because of his his humility I'm attracted to the character of brother Brandon because he never made it about himself he never pointed to himself and so when you see these articles and I just want to say this because a lot of people read this and they'll be like what about the message is it is it true are any of them things true what about the followers oh yeah there's some crazies in this message they claim to believe this message and they're just they're just nut jobs you know they're just crazy and and so and you know it it's always been that way you do you judge Jesus's Ministry by Judas no do you judge Moses's Ministry by by by all the ones that were there and you have Janice and jambus and all the impersonators and they're all right there and you have the ones even the millions that go into the to the desert with him and they all start griping and complaining and turning their backs and they're dying in the wilderness and you're like is this the message no the message is what the messenger said not what the people people were doing listen church when you're looking at the people you're saying well everybody ought to line up to it I have a hard enough time myself lining up to it and you do too the truth be told the devil fights you to live this message the devil tries to tell you it doesn't really matter about everything that he said but it really does matter what he said and somebody will line up to the message brother brandom said when he had a people that were ready to receive it he would send that message and it would strike that elected seed at that time so if the message has come then there's somebody here to line up to the message brother BR go on he said now Brethren I want to ask you something ministers not to be different not to be mean but to be honest don't you think this is a day in all this chaos that we're living in that we've got to be sure about this thing there's too many differences he said and John knew he had to be absolutely sure so he never went to his father's school there's nothing said that he went back to learn to be a priest but he went to the Wilderness and he was in the wilderness until his calling came forth and then he come around and the crowds was standing there and he was so sure that the Messiah was in his day because he was the one that was ordained to introduce this Messiah because Malachi 3 said so I'll send my messenger before my face and he'll prepare the way John knew where he was standing where are you standing this morning are you standing on the message of the hour or are you looking to a man and you'll be tossed this way and tossed that way and you'll think this way and you'll think that way and one one day you believe this way and one day you believe that way but if you're tied to the message of the hour nothing can move you none of these things can move me no no no thought of death could move me from this message no thought of death no no thought of Torment could move me from this message no no no uh no world power that would put a squeeze on me could take me from this message why because I'm not following a messenger I'm following the word that he brought nothing can make me doubt this message and follow him as he followed Christ you say did he ever not no the truth is I can look back on his life and his message and there were a couple times where he said I should have done this and I disobeyed God and he corrected me for it just imagine a man of that status that would be humble enough to tell you when he made mistakes publicly I can follow that man I'd rather follow that man than a man that said he never made a mistake if he told me he never made a mistake then I would know he wasn't a prophet because if he said he never made him come on somebody you telling me that a mortal man that was born in sin shaped in iniquity could be perfect only by the blood of Jesus that's right he was just a moral like you and I I know this is hard because you know people think well you're attacking the messenger man there's nobody if you could pick one person for me to go sit down and have dinner with right now then brother brandom nobody I'd rather pick why because you talk about a man that God used you talk about a humble man you talk about a man that was so listen the man prayed and he sacrificed his life and listen I give honor to the man I I I you know I've been where you know you walk in places where men have walked you go out to Arizona you can go to the places where he was at where the sword came into his you can do all these things and you can go to Jeffersonville and walk where he walked and see where he preached and all those things that's absolutely cool to me amen I love all those things that all means something to me but brother Brandon would say it like this if you had a literal uh a vial with the blood of Jesus Christ in it it would be nothing it would have no power in it right the literal blood was nothing because you have his spirit in you you have more than a literal blood I have more than something literally that brother brandham touched I have more than that I have the message that he brought and that's what God sent to the church you still with me so far brother brandom said it like this he said John knew he had had to be absolutely sure he said uh he was so sure that the Messiah was in his day because he was the one that was promised to come no matter how many priests would say you mean to tell me the time we got up here and the daily sacrifice will be done away with he said there will come a time when the Lamb of God will come that'll take away the sacrifice standing in mud with whiskers over his face that you'd run him away from your house today I remember a brother one time he stood up and he said if John the Baptist come and stood in this Pulpit would you receive him think about that he's got whiskers he's got mud no we would not he would never get in the back door and you know we're a different Society so I guess you can figure some of that but but he doesn't but but I think you could make a point there that he doesn't have to be the best dressed he doesn't have to be the the most well spoken if that's even a phrase he doesn't have to be listen God comes in humility and he comes in Simplicity and he reveals himself the same way God is humble God is that is the nature of God if you watch how God has always come it's always been humility and if you see the way God has expressed himself you'll know that he's humble I know this is a little slow this morning but I want to lay this in here just for a moment and I've still got a little time left so don't run me off yet he said God is not in class and glamour as we try to put him in and we Pentecostal people God is in humility the church can say am there he was standing watching him and he was introducing he said and he was so sure that he was there he said there is one standing among you who you don't even know he said oh my what a rebuke there is one among you right now who you don't know he said I wonder if it might sound sacrilegious if I mimicked him for a minute maybe I'd better not he said one among you that you don't know you claim to know him but you don't galtha gotha they killed the very God that they claimed they were serving they didn't know him John said there's one among you and you don't know him and one day he looked out there and he absolutely seen a dove coming down from heaven and a voice nobody else saw it nobody else heard it but he saw it it was an absolute not Professor Jones or somebody else it was upon whom Thou shalt not see the spirit descending and remaining on one he is the one that will baptize with the Holy Ghost in fire that's the Divine Vindication of God making it so it was an absolute there was no question in John's mind there it was just exactly what God Said would take place there it was so that Dove upon that ordinary man was John's absolute now nobody else out there might have been able to look at that and say that's my absolute because they didn't have the same understanding that John had but see John had read the word and was looking for something to come and when it happened he recognized that it happened I wonder if he didn't come by this morning and we didn't recognize he was here because we weren't looking for him brother BR would go on he said don't he said now I'm going to close by saying these few words I'm not brother brandom says this he says don't you think we need an absolute can you say amen he said don't you think we need something that's real we need something that you can say this is it put your hands on it this is it now I would say that that today for me is this message that for me today is not your idea my idea your opinion my opinion but today I can say this message is it this message is my absolute this message when it says I will do what it says I'm going to hold on to why because what he said was not his own words but it was the voice of God speaking to this generation and I believe what a prophet said and so you may say well he made mistakes here and he made mistakes there he said I don't want you to remember me for those things remember I don't want to look at the man's mistakes because I'm not looking at the man when you look at a message and you see the mistakes you're looking at the wrong thing you're looking at the message you're saying I see mistakes in the message you're looking for mistakes in the message I'm looking at a perfect message brought by A Perfect God sent to the Bride of Jesus Christ to raise you up from the condition you were in is it perfect yes it's perfect because it wasn't a man's message but it's from God himself amen so if you're looking at the messenger you're going to look at a message of mistakes but if you're looking at the word that he brought you're going to see a perfect word for you I think today that's why we've got people saying did he make mistakes did he not make mistakes the truth of it is the man made mistakes he said he made mistakes but the word is not a mistake and so I'm not going to start pointing you to a man's mistakes because I'm not pointing you to the man come on somebody when you hear pastor always pointing to the mistakes what are they doing they're always pointing to the man I'm not looking at the man I'm looking at the message that might be unpopular to say but I don't really care because I believe that's what a prophet said and he says it like this he says now he says uh it's got to be scriptural and absolute how many believ that he said let me just give you a little personal thing here before I close brother brandom keeps saying he's going to close I hope that's not not the Lord telling me to he said brother or sister when I take my choice whether I wanted to remain with the Baptist Church or what it was just as good as any of the other ones a bunch of men put together which is all right but when it come to a time they had to tell me what I had to compromise with the word now that ain't he said I ain't made out of that what about us I ain't made out of compromise you ain't made out of compromise you were made to fly higher and see a little further than these denominational chickens is that all right man I told my brother the other day I had a sermon title come to me about the but the chickens that are going to be here when we leave this world we're going to look down and we're going to see Fried Chicken Lord forgive me but I'm not going to be here and so I did not preach that one and I probably won't he said now he said I ain't made out of that he said the word is first how many can say Amen to that he said they said if you don't do it he said you don't do that you can no longer belong to the Baptist Church he said I don't do it it isn't the Baptist Church that saved me it was Jesus Christ that saved me he said he is my ultimate he is my stand he is my absolute he is my ti poost can the church say amen he is my tpost there I stand where do you stand brother Joel on the word where is stand on Christ the solid rock I stand all other ground is sinking sand if you're standing on a man's opinion it's sinking sand but if you can stand on the word of God for your day all the promises lay in the word and I would say today if you need healing stand on the promise of the word and make that your absolute if you need your family to be saved stand on the promise of the word and let your family come back under the absolute Authority that your house shall be saved I want to just go ahead and tell you something today there's no reason to start doub and look at a man's mistake but start looking at the word because in the word you'll find an absolute that can change your life and change your body and change your family history I would say today start looking to the word get your eyes off a man and look to him because he is our absolute in the beginning the word was the word was with God the Word was God and so if we say he is my absolute what we can say today the word is my absolute absolute brother Danny that's our Authority is the word when the deacons get together and they decide to make a decision on who's going to do what and where and when and how what they have to always consider is what does the word say when a pastor is going to stand here and preach the gospel to you he better go back and see what the word says it may not make everybody happy but you've got to say what the word said because that is our absolute and any man that doesn't have that absolute has no business being in the Pulpit but if you've met God on the basis of his word and that has become your absolute then I would say today hold on to the absolute and preach the gospel brother B said he is my absolute he is my son he is my life he is my ti poost my North Star he's all that I could ever think to be he is that to me he's my life can the church say amen he said and he goes like this and I love how brother brandom ties his absolute to an anchor he says and before you can have faith you've got to have something to have faith in welcome the church say Amen this morning amen you've got to have faith in something if your faith is in a man your faith can be shaken if your faith is in your church your faith can be shaken if your faith is in the ship that you're riding in then you can be shaken and tossed to and fro but if you're anchored to Christ the solid rock then nothing can move you the waves can blow and the winds can blow and the waves can rock your boat but nothing can move you from from the foundation where you're anchored can the church say Amen this morning if you've got an anchor then you better hold on to that anchor this morning because all the devils in Hell may be trying to come at you and trying to get our women to start acting like the world and start making you dress different and start acting different and maybe they're trying to get us to start getting cold and formal in church but can I go ahead and tell you something none of these things move the Bride of Jesus Christ because we have an anchor so none of these things I don't care how cold the church gets nothing is going to stop me from worshiping in the house of God nothing's going to stop my praise why because I have an anchor brother Rand would go on like this he said he said you have to have faith in it in the word of the Living God what's created the powers of the almighty he said what more could we put our hopes in therefore it makes you look different act different you are looking for God to fulfill his promise and when difficulties arise like we have now it is an anchor it's something that holds you something that you are tied to it's a promise that we have been tied to the word of God is he said and just like the anchor is the absolute to the ship in the time of the storm the ship can be sailing the Sea and the anchor is out in the front of it it's he said and it rest and you people here he said close to the Sea and he was talking to the people in Houston I believe it was and he said he said with the this excess weight of this Great Mighty anchor but he said when the storms come and the Raging storms that rips up the sea and could throw the vessel into the the bank somewhere and crash it or turn it over in the shallow Waters it gets out in the deep water and lets down this great huge anchor and he said it's so fixed till it'll drag on the bottom of the sea until it hooks into the top of some unseen mountain and then let those storms rage if they want to it's got an absolute I'm so glad that we're holding on to the Unseen today and we have an absolute my absolute is not a man my absolute is not where he walked or not what he did but my absolute is the message that the man carried and I'm so glad that I'm riding on that absolute today and I'm holding on to it because in the midst of the storm he still is holding me amen you say well brother Joel brother random is my absolute well that's just fine I'd rather he be your absolute I'd rather you you know you can worship him if you want to but I'm worshiping the god that made the man come in this hour and called me out with a messag I'm worshiping the message that he brought the the word that is Christ that's who I worship that's who I choose to worship we give honor we give respect to the ministry we give respect to the men we give respect to the prophets but if you look at Moses's Ministry just for a second if the people were so anchored to Moses that when he couldn't go over the people decided to not go over but Joshua and Caleb were not anchored to the man but they were anchored to to the promise I hope you can hear me just for a moment now if you were anchored to the man you would have died there in the wilderness but if you were anchored to the promise you were going to go over and you were going to fight the good fight and you were going to overcome why because you were anchored to something more than humanity and he said hope this is okay y'all still with me y'all okay my time's almost up y'all just you can start shouting if my time's up okay The Anchor Holds somewhere when you start shouting real loud I'll just quit well nobody wants me to quit all right he said The Anchor Holds somewhere Yonder but it's tight and as the ship and the waves whip around the ship it's got an absolute because it's tied I want to focus on this for a few moments before we close he said that's the way that a man is when he's tied to Christ and to his word and believes it there's an absolute there something that holds him an AB abolute is like the North Star when you're lost he said you've lost all your directions but you can have that compass in your hand and you can actually take that Compass I don't care if you get rocked around Shook Up turned upside down you can hold that Compass out and it will always point you toward the North Star that's right so is the so the compass was pointing you to an absolute and this is my final point before we close I'm so glad today we y'all are looking at me like you're a liar I'm watching the clock we're okay the compass that came in our day was literally pointing us to the word and you're sitting there shaking it I wanted to point to something else it was always going to point to the word oh I wish my I wish that Compass would point back to me no it's going to point to the word why does my compass not Point towards a man because it was focused on the north star and the compass is always going to point you to him why because it's not about you it's not about the church it's not about the preachers it's not about the pastors it's not about the man that God used to bring this message but it's about him and the message that he brought listen Church the message is Christ that's what we're tied to that is my absolute you might see it a little different than I do I might see it a little different than you do listen that's not my absolute my my way of seeing things is not your absolute right but if we hold our Compass up and we turn it on and listen to that Compass it's always pointing back to him if you're listening to a compass that's pointing to themselves you got a broken Compass that's right brother Bram said an absolute is like the North Star and he goes on down and he says man this is a long quote I may have to quit this one he said you know the same Morning Star is the evening star also because the world just turned around but there's one star that does not move and it's centered right in the middle of the Earth and therefore it's a sh star if you know the North Star you can always find your way around but oh that's when a man is lost and he doesn't know just which way to go now he said I know a star it's more than a north north star and to be tied and see his presence no matter how you're lost or where you are you can find your way back by his guidance that's his word it's the way out of all troubles it's the way to peace how many needs peace in their life how many's in trouble you don't have to put your hand up to it but if you got trouble in your life he is the way out of all troubles it's the way to peace it's the way to success are you needing success he is the way to success you never thought about that did you he said it's the way to life itself is to follow this star the Lord Jesus and now if you are tied to the star the holy spirit is the compass that'll only point to the star a compass he said it is magnetized to that North Pole and the only way no matter how much you juggle it or in your How Deep The thickets are around how much jungle you're in How Deep The thickets are around you or how foggy it is it see the compass hand you can turn it any way you want to it'll swing right back and point to the north star and he said when we're in trouble and trusting Christ there's one thing sure the Holy Spirit Will point us to the word that will guide us to the North Star how many believes that this morning and to deliver of everything thing we have need of he is our absolute now I'm just crazy enough this morning to believe that a prophet if he said he is our absolute he is my absolute brother Brandon would say this turn from your lukewarm ways get away from all these things that's dragging you out like Hollywood these things that's dragging you like the rest of the churches return to God and get an absolute that will hold the anchor of your heart if your absolute has become Hollywood lay it aside this morning and let your absolute become the word again if your absolute has become a man then lay it aside this morning and look to the word can you say Amen if your absolute has become something other than this word I say lay it aside this morning lay aside every sin and weight that so does so easily beset you and let us run this race with patience and let us look to the one who is is the North Star and let us look this morning to the one who is our absolute and if he is our absolute then none of these things around me can move me it don't matter how the women dress it don't matter how the men dress it don't matter how how your pastor Falls or how your wife Falls or how your brother or your sister Falls away none of these things move me why because on Christ the solid rock I stand all other ground is sinking sand I'm holding on to the one who cannot fall I'm so glad this morning that it doesn't matter about the ones around me that that that might tell you this is wrong or that's wrong or the message is just listen this message ain't wrong I'm tied to this message and I'm going to hold on to it why because it's holding on to me I can't let it go and if it's my absolute this morning I'm going to do everything I can to line up to this message he said Lord Jesus this is a prayer of brother random he said your word is from old it's the beginning and the end I now with this congregation consecrate myself a new over this Pulpit today I ask for this church the Life Tabernacle is where he was at he said for a consecration settle all the differences let it all be gone bygones be bygones yes and he said Ministers of the Gospel who is worried and thought something would take place oh God we tie ourself this morning to Jesus Christ the word and determined to know nothing else but Jesus Christ and him crucified Oh north star oh holy spirit oh Compass of God come now into every heart and we consecrate ourselves to you and I want to just say tonight or this morning that if we're tied to him you can't be shaken if you're tied to him let the world do what it will it's not my absolute anyway if you're tied to this word church then when the word says something we ly to it and if the messenger said something listen I I I believe and I don't want want you to go away this morning and say was brother Joel putting down the messenger no that was God's man for the hour and that was the man that we could look to and say God sent a prophet in this day with thus sayith the Lord and he was he was sent with a message to turn our hearts back and and the man came and he did his job and he died like a mortal so that we would not look to the man but we would look to the message that he brought and in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery shall be finished we're living in a day of an open book and we can tie ourselves to that open word today you say well are we tied what are we tied to listen the denominations are saying I'm tied to a book I'm tied to the word I'm tied to the Bible they're all saying it but they don't know what they're tied to because they can't see past the seal that is holding it back from them but to our eyes that have been opened today we can see past the seal and we can say God has sent a prophet with a message and I'm tied to it this message is my absolute I wonder if we can stand together this morning I know this is I went a little over time and I know this is just a little bit cut up but what's your absolute this morning is it a man or is it the word I said this last week when Ezekiel Saw when he looked he saw a wheel in the middle of a wheel and and brother brandom said when he looked he saw the Hub and he said the Hub in the middle of the wheel was Christ and all things all the spokes everything off the Hub was tied to him and so this morning to make that wheel go around and to make ourselves tied and stay in Balance we've got to be tied to the hub the wheel in the middle of the wheel are you tied to the message this morning amen I'm not holding this message because if I was holding the message I could let go but because the message is holding me I can't let go of it I've been pointed to a man before but when I listen to the tapes he doesn't point me to a man he points me to him so what is my absolute it's Christ and if that's my absolute then I can stand here with Assurance today and say if I stay with this word then you'll see me in a Rapture why because the same word that has brought me to the message is the same word that is calling me to come up higher and the same word that is going to call me from this Earthly vile body that I'm living in it's the same word that's going to look brother Jeff we're going to look at each other one day and we're going to be the same age and we're both going to have hair you think it's a fairy tale it's an absolute truth is the rapture real it's an absolute truth is this message of fairy tale it's an absolute truth it was a revealing of Christ in our day to show you that the word is here and when the word is here all things are possible if you'll just believe it if you'll believe on the absolute this morning I would say all things are possible if you've got children that are not saved hold to your absolute if there's sickness in your body hold to your absolute amen sister Millie's blood pressure was real bad this morning she didn't know she'd get to come it was just skyrocketed crazy High when the Devil comes in like that when the enemy comes in like a flood God has raised up a standard he's raised up somebody who will hold on to an absolute and say I'm going to run with this message why because it is the word of God today it is my absolute with your heads bowed and your eyes closed brother brandom said he said don't look to me as a man I'm a man I'm full of mistakes but look to what I'm saying about him aren't you glad we had a man who could point us to the man if you have a need on your heart the altars open if you find yourself drifting at Sea we have an anchor sometimes you just need to let down the anchor and rest a while and when you're there and the anchor is [Music] holding and you feel like you're still being tossed to and fro remember we have an anchor and the anchor is not just there when we're shouting the anchor is not just there when we feel good it is not just there in the noise but when the waves calm and you look all the time the anchor was holding and I loved how a prophet said he said the anchor he said it may have moved around but he said pretty soon it caught onto some big mountain some unseen Mountain at the bottom of the sea I'd say reach up this morning and there's an unseen hand that's willing to hold on to you if you have need of an anchor this morning with every head bowed every eye closed if you need prayer the altar is open won't you draw me [Music] Lord oh just draw [Music] be oh won't you draw be [Music] L and I'll run after you oh Lord I need you oh yes we do Lord I need oh we need you now Lord we need you come and take me away oh yes [Music] strong oh can you just worship him now oh won't you draw me Lord oh just draw oh Draw Me Lord [Music] and I'll run after you oh yes I need oh do you need an anchor this morning just reach up and hold on to that unseen hand Let It Be Your anchor Lord I need you I need you now come and take me away oh Lord I need oh we need you now oh yes we do Lord I need you now Lord I need you now so come and take me away if they would just play quietly if you need him this morning I wonder if there's one that needs prayer right there in your seat you see I've got worry in my [Music] life I've gotten cold on [Music] God I've let the world get a hold of me I need an anchor I wonder if you can just look to him now say Lord draw me close to [Music] you the seas are troubled the disciples maybe you've looked to him and said Master don't you even care if we perish but he's been in the boat the whole time [Music] all you got to do is go wake Jesus this morning if you've got a need he's in your boat he is your anchor he is your absolute and when he comes into your storm and into your situation he'll speak peace over your life peace be still and the winds and the waves obey him why do they obey him because he is the absolute of all all things that have been created does this Earth have an absolute it's him do we have an absolute it's the same God that can calm the Seas and the storms and the waves that's my absolute this morning so if you need more of him say draw me Lord draw me Lord and I'll run back to you if you failed God in some way I say run back to him this morning with your hands up to him say Draw Me Lord and I'll run back to you after you oh Lord I need do you need him right now Church oh Lord I need you I need you now oh Lord I Need You Now now so come and take me away one more time draw
