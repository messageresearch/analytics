special unspoken request you'd like to make known by way of uplifted hand God sees each and every heart and knows every request Heavenly Father we thank you Lord for the privilege of being your children Lord for the ability to come out here on a Sunday morning Lord and know that our requests are heard yes oh God lord you wouldn't have to hear you wouldn't have to take heed but you do Lord we're so thankful for that today oh Lord I I don't know what the needs are maybe spiritual Financial Lord physical emotional Lord you know this morning I pray you'd move me aside and speak directly to those needs that that can be met Lord by the word Lord we believe that your word is powerful it's quick it's alive it's it's sharper than a two-edged sword even while the service is going on this morning that you can meet those needs Lord I pray you'd Grant it today oh God God we we we want to do what's right Lord we want to we want to be in your will today God I pray you'd help us to do that may there not be one ounce of humanity in it but may it be just exactly what you would have Lord and we'll give you the praise and the glory and the honor and we love you and we thank you for it in Jesus name amen amen hallelujah love the Lord this morning going to read from Isaiah 66 six and verse one it's good to have uh each of you with us this morning a few visitors this morning God bless you brother Monroe good to see you buddy I been trying to get Monro to come see me for years now so I appreciate you coming today I know you got a special reason for doing that and we thank you for that and give our greetings to the church back home and back in Gibson we sure appreciate appreciate that church and those people but the Monroe's always been a blessing to me well sort of a blessing he's um but the Monro always kept me in check if I I get a little bit bigheaded he's always there to kind of prick me a little bit make sure that so I'll be waiting for what you have to say this morning Mar we get done we love you man I I appreciate all of you and and uh just been a little Revival among the the kids here in the church lately and I thank God for that amen you want to see a movement towards God you want to see people Desiring God even when they're very very young it's wonderful and and we want to keep that up and and uh thank you for that and and so we're going to have some baptisms over the next few weeks and just wonderful we we really expect God to move you know God can get a hold of them while they're young there's no reason why we have to lose them yeah why do they have to go out in the world let's just keep them right here the time is too short we're right there at the end let's just keep them right here with us and just just be a a Powerhouse for God it's what we want to speak on this morning Isaiah 661 thus sayith the Lord the heaven is my Throne the Earth is my foot stol where is the house that you build unto me where is the place of my rest pray the Lord would add his Blessing to the word you may be seated this morning we're building something I think we could all agree that that even here at the church we're building something you're building something in your family I would say that all of us build every day in our words and our thought in our actions we're building you're you're either building or tearing down by everything that you say everything that you do and we want to be Builders we want to be edifiers we want to be encouragers not uh not destroyers if if your whole life is built around destroying something you'll find out that it was fruitless in the end there's no fruit of that there's no building of that you can we we can spend our lives trying to tear down another church or tear down another denomination or tear down something else but that's not what we're called to do we're called to build something and we do that our words build something you'll find that you can build peace in your home by the words that you speak in your home you can build uh you can build uh a unity in the church by the things you say one to another or you can you can tear down you can uh you can take Unity away doing the same thing right and and so we we want as again as we're in a season of Revival and growth we want to make sure that what we're building is something that lasts something that's built on a foundation that's sure and and we want to make sure that uh we don't judge the results based on a moment a moment in time but that we look at the big picture and we begin to look and see what God's doing and begin to see there's something here that'll last there something that is not dependent on a pasture something that's not dependent on uh who stands behind the pulpit something that's not dependent on who sits in the pews but something that is a move of God that's building the lives of people yes sir so what are we building today and I would challenge you with that what are you building as an individual because all of us are Builders and all of us are being built yeah right so Paul writes in in the book of Corinthians now we know that there's two churches in the New Testament that stand as kind of Polar Opposites and that's the Corinthians and the Ephesians and and we've went through that how that the Ephesians is what we're aspiring to that that's what we are we are not a Corinthian Church brother randam never told us that there would be another Corinthians that there would be another group of squabbling fighting backbiting bunch of people that couldn't get the gifts right and couldn't get anything right but there's going to be another Ephesians he said at the end time that's what we are is another Ephesians that's what we're called to because that's the the Joshua generation if we can say it that way the the age of of entering in going in that's the Ephesians being settled this is a an adoption message this is a message not of a a fly by night or or an overnight Revival or a cycle of Revival and death but this is a message that stops the cycle this is a message that means you don't have to be in today and out tomorrow and up today and down tomorrow but this is a message that brings you into the presence of the holy of H H brings you under the presence of the word so you can live for God on Monday and Tuesday and Wednesday and Thursday and Friday listen kids you don't have to have just experience after experience that's wonderful to have an experience but one day you need to reach a place where you you just keep growing you just keep going up you don't have to go down you don't have to you don't have to get worse you can get better remember brother randam told us that you can you get better or worse in every service yeah right every time you come to the house of God and here the word of God you'll leave either better or worse I tell you what I I do not believe that we have to leave worse we can leave better we can leave better every single time we come to the house of God we can keep going up because this is an age not an age of failure this is not an age of defeat this is an age of going up come on and if people preach a message of defeat what it means is they're living in a l to see and Age come all of us are affected by able to see it but that's not us we're the Overcomers of that age yes sir we're not defeated right so now are you with me so far I want something that lasts don't you that's something that'll keep me yeah I don't always feel like worshiping God I don't always feel like preaching I didn't feel like much like preaching this morning until I got out here and saw your faces and saw how wonderful the the audience looked this morning you just look so so so happy to be here and and I'm so excited by that that it just all your I'm tired man I I I've been through a lot this week and and not felt really well in my body and we've been supporting the meetings and then going and preaching and traveling and doing those things but I'm here to tell you this morning that my my praise to God is not dependent on how I feel my my my preaching even is not dependent on how I feel but God is inside of me he wants to express something through me he's inside of you he wants to express something through you yes it's more than just a how a preacher feels how I feel should not dictate the service how it goes how you feel come on church should not dictate how you receive but there ought to be something more than that something real you can get a hold of you're going to feel bad sometimes cuz we live in a body of Flesh a prison House of uh this flesh is never get saved I I've said that before two-thirds of you never get saved but the soul is saved and so the soul has the ability to overpower the the body and the spirit I'm so glad for that today thank you Lord amen amen what are we building Paul writes to a Corinthian Church it seemed to be building a Powerhouse people coming in constantly miracles signs and wonders but but really what they were building was Babel yeah they weren't they were not building well because they were building faction and I'll say this this morning you can't build on complexes you can't build on Faction and remember what you say I have to be very careful what I say behind the pulpit because what my words build or they tear down and so I can't build on complexes I can't build on Faction I can't build on unbelief I can't build on uh everybody's going to hell and we we might as well go with them I can't build on that kind of an attitude I got to build on the word preach the word is everybody if is everybody happy preach the word is everybody sad preach the word is the church is a church in a valley preach the word preach them out of the valley is a church on a mountain preach the word that'll make the mountain top last preach the word he said that's the only way that's the only way to set things right yeah but the Corinthians got a place in 1 Corinthians 3:4 they said while one sayith I'm a Paul and another I'm of Apollos are you not carnal who then is Paul and who is apollis but ministers by whom whom you believed even as the lord gave to every man I think God help us today to recognize just because it's our favorite preacher doesn't mean they're the only ones we need to hear yeah I've told you before I think I told you a couple weeks ago we we do I do not want you to just hear me because if you only hear me you're only getting one part of the fivefold ministry I believe you need a pastor or I wouldn't be here I wouldn't be doing what I'm doing but I believe that you've got to hear from other parts of the ministry as well right he said I planted a poish water but God gave the increase so then neither is he that planteth anything neither he that WTH but God that giveth the increase I want to propose to you today that the age of denomination is over yeah the age of building on a man's capabilities or a man's Ministry is over the age of building around a pastor that controls people by force and says what meetings they can go to and what services they can go to to and what church they can go to that age is over we're we're a bride that cannot be deceived we're a bride we're people that are being built up we we're not I'm not here to tell you where you can go and where you can't go what car you can buy and what you can do I'm here to preach the word and you're here to receive the word I have planted a poish water but God gave the increase and he that planteth and he that WTH are one you ever think about it like that so the the face behind the pulpit is interchangeable doesn't feel like it sometimes does it but it's God expressing another side yes right so if I preached this morning brother Joel or brother Stuart or somebody else would preach this afternoon no matter who it is it's that diamond that that that there's been uh it's like that Crystal where the random talked about that the Rays off of it it catches a littleit different side of it and it and it expresses something of God it expresses something of deity so if I'm up here this morning and express a certain side of it brother jeles up here this afternoon expresses another side of it what are we doing what are we doing we're actually both it's both God expressing if we're doing it right it's God expressing himself to his people we are laborers together with God you are God's husbandry I love the way he puts this you are God's husbandry you are God's Building so if we're building something today you are God's Building according to the grace of God he said which is given unto me as a wise master builder yeah I have laid the foundation and another buth there on so every one of us brother Joel we we we build on the foundation that Paul laid Yeah amen right and we can build whichever way we want to yeah right but and still say well we're pre preaching what Paul preached but I'll say this does the results that we're getting and the the time that we're living in the season that we're living in reflect that because what happened with brother brandom is he was Vindicated to be one who preached what Paul preached because his message matched the season and matched the time and match was appropriate for the day and it's appropriate for today so any of us can say well I preach what Paul preached everybody says it the Baptist say it the Methodist say it the Pentecostal say it everybody says that and that's fine they each one can has a right to look at it and see what they see but I I what we're doing is taking the message of the hour and we're looking at and saying there's something here that's in the scripture that's applicable to our day light has come in our day that that brings us that we can build clearly on the foundation we're not worried about uh about well I can't really see what Paul said I can't understand it but we're actually able to build on Paul's Foundation because of the message of the hour are you with me so far now he said other Foundation can no man lay than that is laid which is Jesus Christ aren't you glad for that today he is the foundation we're going to get to that a little bit more in a moment so we're not building an organization I'm not here this morning to build an organization Christ never sent me to build an organization Christ sent me to build individuals yes right so we're not building a church and that may run counter to what people do today where it's all about numbers but we're not building churches we're not building groups of Fellowship right we're not building denomination we're building individuals and and that's why it bothers me so much when I go plac it seems like well they're all concerned about keeping the group together and doing this and doing that that's not my concern my concern is to build individuals and if I can help build individual no matter where they are no matter what's going on in their life I want to help I want to put my shoulder to the wheel I don't want to destroy an individual because I disagree with the system they're in right so Christ sent me to build individuals so my job as a pastor is to preach in such a way that the word would go out and the word is a living thing oh see when you're born again brother bar talked about being born he said a cell replicates itself right when when you were born in human birth when you were conceived there was one one little cell one little germ but then it it multiplied itself and it didn't build a cat or a dog or something else it built a human being right because that's what it was and so it just kept building and kept building until you until you become a human being and it didn't stop there it kept building and kept building until you become a full stature of a human being you become you were the building uh but it was all contained in that little seed so every word that I preach is a seed everything thing that that comes across this Pulpit every time you hear the tapes every time you read a book every time you open your Bible it's a seed yeah right right there's a seed there and the seed said I know the thoughts that I think towards you thoughts of peace and not of evil that's the thought of God it's a seed of God it comes down in your heart and it begins to replicate itself right it begins to build well I am a child of God see we can build confidence or we can build we can destroy yes confidence we can build we can build people who know where they stand we can destroy and not people not know where they stand never know if they're saved or not yeah right by our words by what we say so Christ he said sent me to build individuals to the stature of Jesus Christ that they might be someone say they they they might be the PowerHouse we're not building a Powerhouse church I hope you hear me today we're building a Powerhouse individual that's my interest this morning not in building a great church not in building although I believe we have a great church and I'm glad that you're sitting here it's much more inspiring to preach to people than to preach to pews right I I enjoy that but we're not building a Powerhouse we're not building a a building that that that the world could look at and say there's a powerful Church what we're building what we're building as individuals and if you have individuals that are built in the full stature of God you'll have a power Church you'll have power in the church you'll have strength in the church you'll have abilities in the church you'll have talent gifts in the church if you build the individual right so every one of us have to build yeah right right because I'm not building by myself right you're building yes now so he said we're building the statute of Jesus Christ they might be the PowerHouse and the dwelling place of the Spirit by his word by his word not by my complexes but David good to see you this morning I think you were supposed to be here not by my complexes not by my abilities not by the good things about me or the bad things about me right not on my personality by his word oh God help us to see it today by his word build up the individual to that place not build an organization to a greater denomination but build the individual to sons and daughters of God we're not building a denomination a program or even a church we're building people that's why when I use a Ministry I want a Ministry that builds I want people that stand in this Pulpit that build I don't care who they associate with and and who they might go to church with or something like that as long as it's something that's sane and and and godly but but I don't that's not what I'm building I'm not building connections with other preachers I'm not I'm not building politics I want to build individuals and so you bring people in that'll help build individuals that'll help build miles to where he needs to be and Peter where he needs to be and Finley where he needs to be and every one of these girls where they need to be we're building something I I'll say this I'm kind of getting ahead of myself but if you're building something you can't just leave the material sitting around and go on holiday right even if you're on vacation You're Building yeah you're building your family even if you're even if you're at work you're building yeah you don't leave the material every day you're building every moment You're Building God help me to be a a wise Builder now listen now the church cannot be a Powerhouse unless the people are powerhouses now Ephesians 4:11 tells us that he gave some Apostles some prophets some evangelists some pastors and teachers teachers for the perfecting of the Saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of Christ that word edify is to build it's to build it's the process of of building sometimes transitional I want you to think about that this morning as we're sitting here I don't want you to just just let this pass by I want you to get it this morning if I have to stop and talk I will so that we get it this morning I want you to understand what what we're talking about we're talking about a building yes and it's not you don't just sit still it's not just you wake up one day and there's a building praise God oh I'm a Child of God well you are but you're a child of God when you first started yeah you were a Son of God when the F all there was was a foundation of Faith yeah but you got to keep building on that Foundation of Faith got to keep building so it's transitional it's not strictly concrete it's Improvement that's what the word means edify improvement improvement Ephesians 4:13 till till we all come in the unity of the faith the knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect man or a mature man a full man to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ had an interest interesting conversation with my children this morning brother Peter declared to me that he was a man sorry buddy cuz his voice has changed he's a deeper got a deeper voice he's a man now he does he got a good voice I wish I had that voice I declared to him that a man an adult I said there's only kids and adults right really and as an adult you got to be able to take care of yourself come on right as an adult you don't live in the basement as an adult you pay your own bills right some of y'all like I'm never going to be an adult oh that sounds bad but but you got to grow up at some point a lot of people never grow up well the same thing spiritually yeah other people never grow up you got to grow up at some point you got to be willing to grow up and I'll say this while people are growing you got to give them room to be 16 give them room to be 14 give them room to be 12 they're going to make mistakes absolutely they're going to stumble while they walk but you don't knock them down but the bom said a a father with his children he said he's not going to beat them because they they fall when they walk yeah but he's going to grab them by the hand and walk with them and help them to be able to walk cuz one day they're going to be able to run faster than you can run I don't want my children to make the same Falls I did I want to grab them by the hand and help them walk better than I walked I want them to not make the mistakes that I've made I want them to not have the scars that I've had I want them to be able to walk with with the word until they go home one day because one of these days brother monre we're going to walk home let me walk with them let me encourage them let me let me put something in and build something in their lives so they can walk home with me good that we henceforth be no more children toss to and fro carried about with every wind of Doctrine by the slide of men one of the Great Main marks of a child is are gullible yeah parent parents adults mature Christians should not be gullible I'll say this you you take what I say back to the word you got to got to you don't need to be moved by the slight of men cunning craftiness whereby they lie and wait to deceive but speaking the truth in love yeah I love that they grow up into him in All Things someone say all things which is the head even Christ yeah from whom from the head the whole body fitly joined together the BR said that was that Holy Ghost coming from the top of the pyramid remember he put the Holy Ghost In Between The Headstone and the bottom he said it comes in it fills all the cracks yeah amen oh that's where I want to live that's that's what I want to be the whole body fitly joined together compacted by that which every joint supplieth yeah according to the effectual working in the measure of every part maketh increase of the body unto the edifying or the building of itself in love yes so the church then this morning is a construction zone yes and each one builds according to the gifts he has to bring the individual from one state to another from one condition to another right that that's our job I I'm not preaching at you I'm not I'm not trying to sometimes I'll say something I'm not trying to hurt you what I'm trying to do is bring you from one place to another yeah I'm I'm trying to wake people up where they can come from one station to another because we can't spend the whole time on the foundation we can't spend the whole time on the plumbing we can't spend the whole time on the walls right we got to keep building each one of us has to keep progressing so each one of us is a builder as I said each one of is being built now I don't know who the oldest person is here this morning I I would have you raise your hands but I some of our elders aren't here today and sick and or gone and and I think maybe sister Fritz might be the oldest that we have and she's home this morning maybe listening to the service praying for you this morning sister Fritz she's meant so much to us and and to our family and I'll say this she's a builder she didn't have a family of her own and maybe this will teach us something she didn't have kids of her own so she built in my kids she she she helped my kids she she worked in my kids and and helped my in my Ministry and in my my family and I'm so thankful for that we can do that for somebody else you may not be able to have everything you want yourself your life might be hard but maybe God put you in that place so you can build in somebody else's life some of you have adopted children and I I'm thankful for that I I see so many children that are broken and hurt and and and out here without any parents and you've adopted children I watch them grow in the fear and admonition of the Lord I say thank you for doing that you're building you're voluntarily building in some somebody's life every one of us is a builder and each one of us is being built so the builders originally were the apostles and prophets in Ephesians 21:19 he said now therefore you are no more strangers and foreigners fellow citizens with the Saints it's that time of year of the household of God and are built upon the foundation of the Apostles and Prophets Jesus Christ himself being the Chief Cornerstone the apostles and Prophets the new and the Old Testament in whom all the building fitly framed together yeah you can't build by division right right you can't build by going to the job site and taking materials away right you don't build by going to somebody else's house and taking their materials right trying to undermine what they're doing let them build yes you build your house brother brand said it this way he said you sweep your front steps and I'll sweep mine God helped me to be that way it's so hard though isn't it you see that church over there that brother over there at the dirty front steps my goodness boy I'd like to I'd like to fix them got your own problems that's why I try to fellowship with everybody that I can and without it being just just something so false that I can't Point people to that but but when it's when there's a when there's agreement on the atonement and the token and things like that we can build on that we can build together try to Fellowship ship with you because it's not my job to clean up your church right we have a hard enough time keeping our own clean right we got enough of our own problems without me having to clean up everybody else's right God help me to have the humility to remain that way because we want to build here yeah we want to build here not because this is the only place that people can be built but because this is what God gave us and if God put us here with Harve he must have put us here for a reason there's a reason why we're here so let's build yeah I find myself in the building with a hammer in my hand some of y'all don't use a hammer anymore you use one of them one of them nail guns but if I find myself with a nail gun in my hand on the job site let me build not just attempt to destroy what's been built so the Bible says you're building together for a habitation of God through the spirit parents are Builders yeah uh Solomon said in Proverbs 226 train up a child in the way he should go build him in a certain way and when he's old he'll not depart from it right you glad for that promise gifts and helps in the body are Builders there's people that are builders in the church I believe all of us are Paul says we then that are strong ought to Bear the infirmities of the weak and not to please ourselves oh oh it get sticky here for a minute but I'm a pastor I get to do this so we we don't we don't build to please ourselves in your area of service whether it's song leading or or specials or music or whatever it is or preaching you don't build to please yourself right lots of times I'd like to preach a certain thing and God says no and I have to do what God says because I'm not pleasing myself I'm not here to please myself what would please me is to have a a shack down by the river and fish all all week that's what would please me but it's not what pleases the father and as I become a mature Christian I've got to do what pleases the father so we find us when we're building when we're in a position when we're building in the church we need to Bear the infirmities of the weak not to not to gather together and out that person yeah not to form a firing squad and try to destroy the person but to build up the person do you you have somebody in your Sunday school group do you have someone in your youth group you got somebody in the in among the elders that looks like they're weak and and they're just not up to where everybody else is our job is not to make fun of them our job oh God help us today our job is not to knock them down our job is not to put them out our job is to build them up let's build we're strong we ought to Bear the infirmities of the weak not to please ourselves let every one of us every one of us that includes you I'd say raise your hand if you're every one but some people never rais their hand in church but you are one whether you want to raise your hand or not let every one of us please his neighbor yes for his good to edification to build him for even Christ pleased not himself I'm so glad he didn't but as it is written the reproaches of them that reproach thee fell on me yeah he pleased the father Ministry gifts as we went through they're to build and mature the church all of these are building the individual from one stage to another are you with me so far so we're building well brother Bram calls the stature of a perfect man a Powerhouse yeah a Powerhouse and in individual Powerhouse second Peter 1: 15 let's go there this morning beside this giving all diligence giving diligence it's not just going to happen yeah right you got to give diligence to it yes add to your faith virtue yeah to Virtue knowledge to knowledge Temperance to Temperance patience to patience godliness the godliness brotherly kindness brotherly kindness charity for if these things be in you and abound they make you that you shall neither be Barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ now when brother Brandon preaches a sermon called the statue of a perfect man he takes this and he begins to build a house if you've ever listened to that sermon he's actually building a house or we could say like a pyramid he's building a house and and so anything structurally like you say the pyramid and I've been there brother Joel and I have been there and stood on that pyramid and stood on the entrance to that pyramid on the other side and we've actually stood there on the stones of that it's so massive but it had to have a foundation you notice how wide the foundation is compared to the rest of the building because it's it's it's a phenomenal thing it's built uh by by a master Master Builders but it's there and it's spread out and it's wide and then it gets smaller towards the top because the foundation has to be sure yeah you got to know that you're born again right you got to have faith or nothing else works are you hearing me today nothing else works you can't preach legalism all the time you got to have faith sometimes because if you not don't have faith you can't dress right if you don't have faith you can't act right if you don't have faith you can't quit your smoking quit your drinking quit running around with women or men if you don't have faith you can't do any of that right without faith it is impossible to please God yeah so the very first the foundation of the virtue in your life is faith now brother Brown said notice you must be born again and when you're born again you can't be born again without having faith oh my I hope you hope all of us understand that today you can come and cry all day all right but you're not born again unless you can believe yeah what what Jesus did for you are you with me now and I'm for you crying I'm for alter calls because brother Brandon was but I'm not it being at an altar itself has no virtue in it what you're doing is you're giving something up you're surrendering yourself but there but the virtue is in the faith that it takes to come to the altar the faith that it takes to raise your hand without faith it is impossible to please him for he that cometh to God must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder do you believe he's a rewarder today you come to church maybe you didn't feel like it maybe you maybe you don't you're uncomfortable you don't really want to be here but there's something in your heart that drove you drug you to the house of God and you hear this morning and you say I know that if I come to God and then approach him in the right way I know he's a rewarder of them that diligently seek Him amen now how how do I build this Faith you might say Ben I how do I help how do I build faith in my kids how do I build faith in the church now brother brand said this is for your faith talking about what he's preaching he said now Faith cometh by hearing the word of God that's right now that's that's why how we build Faith yeah faith is not based upon shifting Sands of man's theology but it rest on the Eternal Rock of God's word yeah amen I I can't have faith in a doctrine that you can't find in the scripture come on I can't have faith in a pastor's opinions yeah I can't have faith in somebody's complexes I got to have faith in the word of God yes that's right build Faith by preaching the word build Faith by reading the word build Faith by hearing the word so faith is built in your children by them hearing the word yeah right so if you want your children to have faith let them hear the word wasn't that phenomenal last week brother Joel preaching and just simply laying out you need to be baptized well suddenly several want to be baptized because the word was preached and the atmosphere was right and it it found fertile ground sir I found one time I remember sister Stephanie when you were baptized in trip and and I preached on baptism and we had four baptisms that day and I thought well that's that's Elementary to the church they they understand this but people somebody just needs to hear it sometimes they just need to hear repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost you just need to hear it amen you just need to hear it and then they run quickly to the water to be baptized because they hadn't been bed I say thank God for that let's let's do more of that let's let's teach the word to build Faith to the people I could have got up here and preach the whole sermon on my fight with some other preacher wouldn't have built Faith right true don't you want to build faith in your children let's let's focus now on the family unit read the Bible oh that's simple brother Ben we're wanting to build Faith go to church don't let nothing keep you out of the house of God and I understand there's times you go on vacation and things like that but I'm talking about if you can if you're here if you're in town come to church appreciate brother Allan coming out of the woods this morning to come to church and Lead songs didn't look like he was in the woods at 5:00 did it but he got up this morning and come to church let's do that I know sometimes you're hunting and things and you got to be away I I I realize that not everybody's going to be at church every week but we build Faith by showing your children you belong in the house of God right and Dad and Mom are going to to do what it takes I I'm proud of some of you I know you've made choices in in your life and in your home some of you are here because you want your children to be in church and you knew where you lived you could they couldn't be in the house of God so you wanted them to be in the house of God make that choice build faith in your children because it might be their day that they want to receive from God might be their day that they want to they want to be built into a Powerhouse of god good if you teach your children Church isn't important you're you're not building you're destroying right I'm just going to deal with that because I I'm not preaching to any of you I don't believe you do that I believe you teach your children the house of God is important some of you come from a long ways and can't come on Wednesdays and things I understand that not preaching at you but just as a general principle if you teach your children church is not important you you destroy Faith because what you're doing is you're saying well your ball game's more important the the shows more important that's right that's right the world's more important right you say well I didn't say that but you did that and they learn a lot more from what you did than what you said what you're doing is if you can imagine a job site and we're trying to build your children trying to tell them you need to be in the house of God a church is important you need to be in the house of God we live in a day when everybody has virtual church I don't understand that I I just can't comprehend why someone would want to would would want to trade the joy that we have in the presence of God together as Saints for for virtual understand virtual if you need it we stream because we want people to be able to use that if they need it sister Fritz is there this morning and and I thank God that we've streamed so she can watch in different ones but if you can be in the house of God if you can be in the house of God why why would you choose not to be right but but it's just like you're on a job site and and and I'm over here building I'm build a little I can't build nothing but let's just say I'm building in the bathroom and I build a little build a little stand over here and a little closet I'm building a closet and on Sunday and then I leave okay that little closet you say well that's not that important but it's part of the house go to church right and then next service after I preached it and or brother Joel preached it to somebody and then parent comes in and says well that's not that important takes that support out you taking us supports out the building will fall are you with me now so one of the ways that we grow and I've been asking people how do we keep our kids I know I'm just talking to you this morning but it's part of what I have to do as a pastor how do we keep our kids how what do we do how can we I understand get them the Holy Ghost that's that's number one right get them in the right atmosphere that's number one right but but what can we do I want to do everything we can do right to make sure our children what can we do and and what I've heard back from people's make sure the house of God is number one make sure it's important to them and make sure that and I thought of this myself you know what I've seen is that that preaching and practice have to be pretty close yeah right if you're going out to the casinos and running around running around doing drugs and gambling and doing all kinds of junk during the week you come to the house of God on Sunday your kids aren't going to want to go to church they're going to want to live like you live during the week yeah right they're not you say well my brother Ben why aren't my kids in church and I've been challenged on that before had families come to me and I take it as a personal failure if a child's not leaves if a child's not in church I didn't do my job my job is to keep them here but it's your job as well you can't be going to the job site and stealing the material out are you with me now we just smooth that over and let that go are you with me so far well brand said that's the reason I've been trying to keep the message just as simple as possible Simplicity builds Faith yeah he said some some of you might be wondering why I'm not calling prayer lines each night here's my purpose in doing this I want to build faith in the people in a resurrected Jesus so that you don't have to wait till some special gift passes through the neighborhood you just believe in wherever you are I want to see Faith built in the church until on a Sunday morning on a Wednesday night on on a Sunday night you can receive your healing why because you're not waiting on a gift to pass through you believe that the gift is here that God is the gift amen the healing is the gift it's been bought and paid for by his Tripes faith is built by the Simplicity of hearing the gospel brother brandom says I pray tonight Lord that somehow you'll build faith in these people's hearts that every one of them will be delivered all these sick and Afflicted is that what we want today he said may it be so simple Lord just let us as we try to teach the word let the Holy Spirit I love his humility take my mistakes Lord and make it a real night that he can bed himself into the heart of each believer we set this night for that purpose Lord May those who are not saved Above All Things be ready get ready now all the doors of Mercy is still open so we have faith and we begin to build I'm going to hurry I don't have very many more minutes I'll have to have to miss some of this but we add virtue to our faith said virtue is strength or power he said that's the next foundation wall it's virtue now we're building this house Peter said had virtue Peter's talking about building the house of God the temple of God fixing it to a place virtue like the Lily talks about Reverend Mr Lily that always gives out he said you can't give out if you're if if you can't he said if you don't have any to give you got to have virtue you got to have power you got to have strength right how do you get it by feeding on the word you got to believe it amen and then if you have it you can give it yeah brother brand talks about a man coming along I think this will help maybe some of us in that sermon he talks about a man coming along trying to find Salvation and he goes to a church that believes the days of Miracles has passed yeah and he said said why would he do that why would you go to a church who can't build Faith right I'm not telling you to leave a church I'm telling you what the prophet said why would you go to a church that doesn't build your faith he talked about Jack Co Jack Co said if you go to a restaurant you order the T-bone and they said well that was yesterday's menu he said you want to leave and go find you a restaurant where the T-bone is on today praise God made some of y'all hungry didn't I all right if I go to a barbecue restaurant I expect there to be ribs Brother David I I want ribs and and if they don't have ribs I want to go somewhere where they got ribs if they're always out I tell you what I don't want to go to I don't want this church to be let's focus right here I don't want this church to be a church where the ribs are never on the menu where the steak is never on the menu I want it to be a place where faith can be built how can that be it's got to be preached got to put it on the menu the BR said might as well lay the menu down and get out cuz he ain't got nothing to eat anyhow he said you might as well go where a restaurant it's got something to eat and the spiritual man growing needs something to eat on that's the word of God he said and I believe every word of it now you're moving on up you're building you build a foundation you got faith and virtue now you're moving up you're going to build you're going to start framing or framing the house looks like a nightmare to me some of y'all like that's pretty good the house has to be framed right we don't want to stay in the foundation you said praise God God I got saved well that's wonderful you got to come up moving on up amen so you frame what is that knowledge thirdly you had knowledge I don't mean worldly knowledge because that's foolishness to God but knowledge to judge right from wrong in a day when everything is relative let's make sure our children have a knowledge of right and wrong let's build that into their lives to judge judge right judge whether it's right or wrong to believe God's word judge whether I should serve a Creed or serve God judge whether it's right or wrong we should be mature enough that we can tell if the pastor's preaching the truth or not all right right and we don't have to believe it just because the pastor says it I've always been differential to Authority and just my nature I I try to be that I I've always tried to be differential to people in authority and I believe we ought to be we ought to we ought to serve God and try to there's many little things we could disagree on but when it comes to the to the word of God we got to know it for ourselves and if what I'm preaching is not the word spit it out you don't have to spit me out but SP spit the word out you don't have to do away with the pastor or the preacher just just spit away that part of what wasn't the word I should say spit away the opinion teach your children to judge between right and wrong make sure you don't throw away the whole pie right but brother Bram taught us yeah teach your children to judge between right and wrong to know the difference years ago I I did a study I I read a study where it said kids when they were on a playground that if they put fences on the play play ground they played all the way to the edges but if they take the fences away then there's they don't feel safe and so they group in the center fences are not just to hold people in fences are there for security that's right for safety build frame your house build the fences good right fences on Sunday we go to church it's a fence right just expected on uh when we're having a meeting we go to the meeting when uh there's something there it's a fence you're framing your house when there's something going on uh in the church we don't talk about people we don't run them down we we we have an understanding we're building boundaries we're building expectations Proverbs 23 and2 apply thine heart unto instruction and thine ears to the words of knowledge you say how do I build knowledge into my children I'm I'm gon Break Your Heart Right Here withhold not correction from the child on oh I got to say it because the word still says it if thou beatest him with the rod he shall not die he going to cry like he's going to die but he will not die all the Elder said amen is you've been through that and you know what it's like I know what it's like I you listen if you want to beat your kids you got a problem come on you're just an abuser but don't withhold correction whatever form that takes he said if you beat him with the rod he won't die and and there's a point in life I think when you not and and this is me not the Lord but I do think you pass a point where the rod doesn't do any good anymore you look at a 16-year-old kid walking up there and he's bigger than you are you know that Rod doesn't have much effect on him just make him mad that's right but there's other things you can do he's still a child oh I know that hurts yes but withhold not correction from the child you won't die listen Thou shalt beat him with the rod you didn't think you were going to hear this this morning did you I love that thou shalt beat him with the rod and shall deliver his soul from hell I get in trouble for preaching like that but it's still the truth that's Godly knowledge brother brandom said that that the literate Kentucky mama she said he said she knew more she knew more than uh than a lot of the modern strip teases knew he said because if her daughter come home like some of their daughters come home and she she'd pull out the rod and she said she had more knowledge than the educated people did yeah come on Church why she had Godly knowledge you knew what the Bible said brother B said come to this knowledge now we're going to move on when God said he's the same yesterday today and forever say Amen can we say Amen to that yes sir not to to the 12 it's for all he said when you get that kind of faith when your faith punctuates every bit with an amen glory and you say all right add to that add that to it amen and Temperance we add Temperance that we're building I'm closing in in a few minutes won't say how many a few is temperance that means brother BR said how to control your tongue not be a Tattler w we need this don't we you wouldn't know to dis fellowship with those people if you hadn't listened to gossip God help me I'm going to turn around and repent is't that true well I can't do I can't fellowship with them you know that they did you wouldn't know if you didn't listen to gossip and I don't care if it come from a pastor or or a preacher or me so gossip BR means how to to control your tongue not be a Tattler how to control your temper amen The Temper is not justified the wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of God temper is not justified just because you have a position in the church and can use it not justified in the Pulpit right it don't work the righteousness of God not fly off every time anybody speaks cross to you yeah self-control listen if you can't control yourself you shouldn't be in the Pulpit if you can't control yourself you you you need to come to an altar even if you're just a Christian just a believer I know that's tough but we we need to build we're building lives we're building faith we have to do that by by building these things in our lives self-control Temperance is self-control you build self-control in yourself build self-control in your children brother Brown said add Temperance to it oh Temperance how to answer in kindness when wrath is spoke to you somebody say you a bunch of Holy Rollers down there don't jump out and roll up your sleeves don't you want to do that sometimes people call us Pentecostal and I just oh I'm so frustrated with that because we're not nearly Pentecostal enough come on now prach I would that every one of us get a little taste of Pentecost brother Allen but I want to jump out and fight him and he said don't do that Temperance will make you not do that yeah let him be your example but talk with Godly love Temperance kindness is that the way you want to be amen when you're riled upon R not back let him be your example when they said if thou be the Son of God turn these stones into bread he could have done and shown he was God but he had Temperance when they called him be elab he said I'll forgive you for it right they pulled handfuls out of the beard out of his face and spit in his face and said come down off the cross he said father forgive them they don't even know what they're doing you know we use an excuse sometimes I just preached on this a little bit uh Friday night we use an excuse sometimes we say well I was tired I was worn out so I just lashed out you realize Jesus had been up all night in the Garden of Gethsemane six hours in the garden praying until blood and and water in his body separated yes he he was on a cross he had been whipped with a cat of Ninetails pulled strips from his body he had every right to claim tiredness and lash out he was so weak he couldn't carry his own cross up the hill but he cried out he said father forgive them they don't know what they're doing oh my I'm not perfect like that but I want to be I want to sure into that 1 Peter 2:21 even here until you were called Christ suffered for us leaving us an example he should follow his steps he did no sin neither was G found in his mouth when he was reviled he reviled not again when he suffered he threatened not but committed himself to him that judgeth righteously who his own self bear our sins in his own body on the tree that we being dead to sin should live under righteousness by whose Stripes you were healed we had we're building now we're building the walls we're building the structure building around these things patience patience with what what kind of patience first thing is you have patience with God if you got real genuine Faith you have real genuine patience When God says anything you believe it that's all you got patience the Bible says you have need of patience that after you've done the will of God you might receive the promise I'll say to some of you who've been baptized you're going to be baptized you need to have patience and believe that God will fill you with the Holy Ghost you need to believe it that's part of it it's a promise of God I believe you can do it the moment you're baptized but it may take some time for you to completely die out to the things of the world that's okay have patience let him build in your life yeah James 1:2 my brethren countered all joy when you fall into diverse Temptations knowing this the trying of your faith worketh patience he said and we should have patience with one another too right yeah we get so impatient with one another he he typed that to Moses Moses got impatient with the people he said but when it really counted the people got impatient with God and God said I'm just going to destroy him and Moses seemingly had a better idea than God but he got he got a hold of something in the spirit of Christ and he said Lord take me not the people destroy my family don't destroy the people oh that we had more Ministry like that that we willing to serve the people and serve God by serving his people and Lord I'll step in the Gap I'll do what it takes to make sure that the people are able to come to the house of God and have a place where they can worship God I'll do what it takes to see that they make it into the land Moses didn't make it into the land because of his impatience but the people two of them at least Joshua and Caleb did the promise of God was still true have patience amen he said brother BR said I've tried to get this message over with the Tabernacle see that each member of the Tabernacle become this it's hard to do he said I've tried to have patience this 33 years have patience women still Bob their hair still just the same but just have patience have patience wait have to if you ain't got it don't try to build on this down here have patience patience right so there's things that are written in the scripture people don't do you say well what are we going to do we just have patience with people not everybody's on the same level some people just building a foundation of Faith finishing what are we going to do we're going to finish the house boy doesn't that look like a nightmare good looks good but Joel said but Joel does finishing work look if we're going to finish we might as well finish right let's do a good job let's not leave the quarter round undone off the bottom of the on the floors Amen brother Joel it just not finished it looks pretty good my house looks better with floors but it look even better with the quarter round around the bottom let's finish let's finish some of y'all is like well I'm pretty I'm pretty done well you may be but you're still here there there's some touchup work to do the JT wouldn't still be here unless there was some touchup work to do right there there's a little bit of there's a spot over in the corner take a little brush of God's word there's a little bit of Faith these be have a little bit of virtue a little bit of knowledge a little bit of godliness means to be like God he said be therefore perfect even as your father which is in heaven is perfect he said you got way up here now before you're asked to do that all these things has to be added first then when you get up here he's ask you to now be perfect godliness Sons and Daughters of God we sing the song to be like Jesus don't you want to be like him that's godliness when he was SMI M Smith on one side of the face he turned the other when he was spoken rough to he didn't speak he didn't rout back Godly always looking for one thing I always do that which pleases the father remember you can't do that on your own you must have the Holy Ghost if you don't have the Holy Ghost none of this works yeah yeah you got to have that Foundation of Faith yes set and then the the divine nature you partake of that and then you build you're not done when you receive the Holy Ghost you got to build Matthew 18:21 then came Peter to him and said Lord how often shall my brother sin against me and I forgive him till seven times that's legalism what did Jesus say here's godliness I say not unto thee till seven times but 70 times seven that's pretty rough right there I'll say this if you don't forgive people you won't be forgiven right if you got unforgiveness in your heart today you realize your backslid yeah right I don't care if you're a preacher or a Sunday school teacher or Deacon you got unforgiveness in your heart for for anybody your backs sleep that's right I and I'll say there's there are many reasons I understand I get it people get hurt yes but you got to forgive you don't forgive to help that person you forgive to help you Jesus said he won't hear your prayer unless you forgive when you stand praying forgive brotherly kindness brother said if you see a brother is All Out Of Tune I Get Out Of Tune sometimes yeah you get out of tune sometimes don't be impatient this is finishing right don't be impatient with him no be kind to him go go anyhow yeah people think I don't know what I'm doing when we go to meetings and we try to be of a light to people I believe you're a strong church I believe we've been through enough that we strong we know where we stand well we go because brother Brandon said to go yeah cuz the Bible says to go yeah and put our arms around people and draw our Circle bigger yeah that's right brotherly kindness yeah he said go anyhow somebody said not long ago how can you believe these things the way you do and still go to the Assemblies of God and the Oneness all the rest he said brotherly kindness yes hoping someday patient with him see tempering enduring with him knowledge help me Lord I don't always I go some places and I get mad I'll be honest with you I don't like to see people mistreated I don't like to I don't like to see people it seems like like the just forgive me it seems like some places that the church is there to support the lifestyle of the pastor I said God help us today I don't want to be that God help me not to be that that's not what the church is for we we we want to make sure that and it bothers me but I still go I still want to Fellowship I still want to you know even if I'm frustrated I want to go because he was frustrated but he went he went to Calvary for me the least I could do is go to a meeting come on now yeah well it might not it might help somebody it might encourage somebody may not even help you might help somebody else right is that worth it what do you think you're a builder you going to build or leave the paint sitting there what does it do said they're waiting for the headstone which is love for God is love he controls he's the strength every one of these things aren't you glad for that amen amen he said we're hoping and patient I'm going to skip down he talks about the great Commandments I'm going to skip past that and we have so much more I could say but we're going to close in a moment well the B said when you surrender your complete being then the Holy Spirit just pours through you yes now think about that you got that statue of a perfect man I think I put that on the slid somewhere I don't know if you can find it brother Robert but there's a on the slides there's a statue of a perfect man on there somewhere if you see it put it up for me but brother brand talks about when you surrender into your complete being the Holy Spirit just pours through you you see the Holy Spirit I don't know if you can see it I can barely see it without my glasses but the holy spirit's in between the Capstone and the rest of the body so the Holy Spirit Pours Down it won't work without the Holy Spirit right is what fills the gaps between the stones oh God don't you see why we have to have atmosphere in our services why the Holy Ghost has to be present why we need the Holy Ghost In Our Lives we need to preach the Holy Ghost we need need to live we need to walk in the spirit why because the holy spirit is what makes it all work you can have all the bones of it and it just don't work together you wonder why is it not working why is it producing nonsense why is it producing hatred why is it producing fear why is it producing children that just turn 18 and leave yeah why because the holy spirit's not been poured through the cracks oh God help us today he said so when you surrender your complete being then the Holy Spirit just pours through you in these virtues then you're a living Tabernacle people look out and say there's a man full of virtue knowledge he believes the word Temperance patience God and His brotherly kindness full of the love of the Holy Ghost don't you want to be that man or that woman there he is walking around what is it a stature that unbelievers can look at and say there is a Christian there is a man or a woman who knows what they're talking about you never seen a Kinder sweeter godlier person you're sealed a seal shows on both sides whether you're going or coming you see the seal just the same when a man or woman possesses this in the C cap Stone comes down and seals them into the kingdom of God which is the Holy Ghost and the word coming from here manifests itself through each one of these beings makes this complete being a tabernacle of the Living God a walking living example of Christianity what Christ was these people are is that what you ought to be this morning because his life is in there they are in Christ and their life is dead and hid in Christ to God and sealed in there by the Holy Ghost you reckon yourself dead then you're born of faith and virtue and these other things is added to you till you're a perfect Liv living image of God is that what you want to be this morning let's bow our heads together I wish I had more strength more voice to preach but I think you understand what I'm trying to say we're building something what you got beside you you got a little faith a little virtue little knowledge build with it how can we help somebody not run them down how can we help somebody make a difference in their lives you're teachers I know you make a difference in people's lives I salute you for that build don't build just with worldly knowledge build with the knowledge of Christ build in those kids' lives you that teach Sunday school and may change some things up in the Sunday school we got lots of kids coming up you know I remember my Sunday school teacher I saw at my my grandma's funeral was there a few years ago in a little Holiness Church and she just taught us for a little while maybe a few months but I remember I remember because she was patient with us taught us the word of God just the basics of it but that matters that matters some of you parents you you work and you work and you work you get frustrated you think well I I'm just not doing a good job I I I want to challenge that perception today are you building with the word you doing your best I believe God's got other builders to help you you don't have to do it all you just build what the area that you're called to build and you build that you let somebody else build in their area you get deacons to build and trustees to build and mamas to build and daddies to build I'd like to have a position in the church you don't realize that you have a position you are set in Heavenly places in the land for a reason you do have a purpose there is a there is a reality to what you're doing build don't just be here he said but brother Ben I've made lots of mistakes how could I build you're not building with your own material build with the word all of us have made mistakes some worse than others I get that some of us have fallen flat on our face but build you're you're not there it's not about you it's not about me build let's do what we can to see the church become what God wants it to be to see the bride become what God wants her to be and if I can build here if I can build somewhere else if I can build on Friday night if I can build wherever I'm going let me be let me build that's my TR I express my frustration sometimes to these preachers in the back room and they have to hear that sometimes to my family cuz I feel like I'm not doing anything and and I just go but let me Lord give me a willingness to keep going to keep building Lord if it's just a small crowd or whatever it is to keep building my first job is here I want to build but if I can build in Togo let me build if I can build in Egypt let me build if I can build for the brothers in Africa let me build if I can build for the brothers in Arkansas let me build don't don't let me be somebody who tears stuff out let me be a builder you may not see the results all at once but but eventually you're going to see a building made oh is that what you want is that your desire to today can you just raise your hands with me say Lord I want to build Lord as I'm sitting here in the pr
