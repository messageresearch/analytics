[21:07] have the ersin family back with us and
[21:10] different ones have been out and I know
[21:12] some are traveling tonight 1 Samuel
[21:14] chapter 3 and verse
[21:20] one 1 Samuel chapter
[21:23] three verse one
[21:29] I'm going to uh speak tonight on hear
[21:31] his
[21:31] voice and there's a tape where brother
[21:34] Brandon preaches this in fact all of our
[21:36] quotes tonight will come from that tape
[21:38] and so you can U go back and and listen
[21:41] to it you get a
[21:43] chance for Samuel chapter 3 and verse
[21:45] one the child Samuel ministered unto the
[21:49] Lord before Eli and the word of the Lord
[21:52] was precious in those days there was no
[21:55] open vision and it came to pass at that
[21:58] time when Eli was laid down in his in
[22:00] his place and his eyes began to wax dim
[22:03] that he could not see and he the lamp of
[22:06] God went out in the temple of the Lord
[22:08] where the Ark of God was Samuel was laid
[22:11] down to sleep the Lord called Samuel and
[22:14] he answered here am I and he ran to Eli
[22:18] and said here am I for thou callest me
[22:21] and he said I called not lie down again
[22:23] and he went and lay down the Lord called
[22:26] yet again Samuel and Samuel arose and
[22:29] went to Eli and said here am I for thou
[22:31] D call me and he answered I called not
[22:34] my son lie down again now Samuel did not
[22:37] yet know the Lord neither was the word
[22:39] of the Lord yet revealed unto him and
[22:41] the Lord called Samuel again the third
[22:43] time and he arose and went to Eli and
[22:47] said here am I thou D call me and E Eli
[22:51] perceived that the Lord had called the
[22:53] child therefore Eli said unto Samuel go
[22:56] lie down and it shall be he call thee
[23:00] that thou shalt say Speak Lord for thy
[23:03] servant heareth so Samuel went and laid
[23:06] down on his place verse 10 and the Lord
[23:08] came and stood and called as at other
[23:11] times Samuel Samuel then Samuel answered
[23:15] speak for thy servant Heth I pray the
[23:18] Lord would add his Blessing to the word
[23:19] you may be
[23:22] seated it was a dark time that Samuel
[23:26] was born into in the land of Israel
[23:29] judges like Samson and Gideon had ruled
[23:32] Israel for about 300 years over 300
[23:35] years at that time but one would raise
[23:38] up and whenever he died Israel would
[23:40] backslide and go into captivity again
[23:43] and here would come another judge and
[23:46] each one had his own personal problems
[23:48] and own failings and things and the
[23:50] people had gotten away from God in fact
[23:52] the Bible tells us that each man did
[23:55] what was right in his own eyes and they
[23:57] had actually got into a place where the
[23:59] ministry was corrupt in fact in the end
[24:02] of the Book of Judges you can find that
[24:04] uh there was a a priest that hired
[24:06] himself onto someone's house for 10
[24:09] shekels and a shirt if you go look it up
[24:12] that's what it was and and so they hired
[24:15] on to uh a person to a man's house and
[24:18] they said I'll be your priest and I I'll
[24:20] I'll pray to whatever God you want me to
[24:22] pray to if you'll pay me and so it told
[24:25] how much they paid him and that's the
[24:26] kind of uh Ministry that they had at the
[24:29] time Eli had been a good man but his two
[24:32] sons had had corrupted the ministry to
[24:34] the point where they uh they were
[24:36] worthless Sons the Bible calls them men
[24:38] of bile worthless sons and and so it
[24:42] would not continue on from Eli could not
[24:45] through his children it was something he
[24:47] he did not deal with in a in a proper
[24:49] way and and so there was no channel to
[24:51] hear directly from God there was no open
[24:54] Vision there was no prophet in that day
[24:57] that they could look to and to bring
[24:59] light to the word and and so they made
[25:02] up their own Commandments and their own
[25:03] doctrines and the Bible says in Jesus
[25:06] said in vain they do worship me teaching
[25:09] for doctrines the Commandments of men so
[25:12] it was actually the doctrines that they
[25:14] actually made up themselves because they
[25:16] didn't have any headship I'm so glad we
[25:18] have headship in this day and that's the
[25:20] message of the hour there's a reason why
[25:23] we quote William brandom there's a
[25:24] reason why we believe the message why
[25:27] because there it bring it brought light
[25:28] it brought a Channel of God's thinking
[25:31] into our
[25:33] hour so they had no vision they had
[25:35] Moses law but they had no vision to
[25:38] apply it right so they had the word they
[25:41] had what we would say we had the Bible
[25:43] but they had no vision to apply it no
[25:45] profit to bring light for their hour
[25:47] this day is a lot like that day you'll
[25:49] find in 2 Timothy chapter 3 and verse
[25:52] one it says this know also that in the
[25:54] last days perilous time shall come right
[25:59] that's uh that's times that are
[26:01] difficult times that are that are scary
[26:03] and I think we could say we live there
[26:06] today you young people can say I live in
[26:08] perilous times and it gets more and more
[26:11] perilous as we go on he said for men
[26:13] shall be lovers of their own selves the
[26:16] word selfie was invented in our in our
[26:18] generation men should be lovers of their
[26:20] own selves Covetous boasters proud
[26:23] blasphemers disobedient to parents
[26:25] unthankful Unholy without natural
[26:28] affection truth Breakers false accusers
[26:32] incontinent in other words they they
[26:34] just couldn't control themselves no
[26:36] self-control Fierce despisers of those
[26:39] that are good traitors he high-m minded
[26:43] lovers of pleasure more than lovers of
[26:45] God having a form of godliness but
[26:47] denying the power thereof from such turn
[26:51] away and he said of this sort or that
[26:54] type of a man or uh that's the kind of
[26:56] man which creep men which creep into
[26:58] houses and Lead captive silly women
[27:01] Laden with sins LED away with divers
[27:03] lust ever learning never able to come to
[27:06] the knowledge of the truth they'll tell
[27:07] you what they believe and they and they
[27:09] have lots of head knowledge but they
[27:11] don't have any any heart knowledge they
[27:13] haven't heard the voice of
[27:15] God yeah that's the age we live in in
[27:19] verse eight now as Janice and jambus
[27:21] withstood Moses so do these also resist
[27:23] the truth men of corrupt Minds repub
[27:26] concerning the faith but they shall
[27:27] proceed no further for their fly should
[27:29] be manifest un all men as theirs also
[27:32] was brother brand said we've seen so
[27:34] much of that he said and it's gone on so
[27:36] long until today the word of the Lord is
[27:38] such a rare thing that someone can come
[27:39] and say thus sayith the Lord he said now
[27:42] we've had a lot of impersonations of
[27:44] that Satan is really on the job there's
[27:46] a lot of janises and jambes out there
[27:49] you can find them on YouTube you can
[27:50] find them in the Pentecostal realm you
[27:52] can find them all over the place he said
[27:54] but there's a lot of
[27:56] impersonations and many years gone by
[27:58] people were afraid to say that unless it
[28:00] was the Lord but today they just don't
[28:02] care right there's no headship in the a
[28:05] there no headship in the world but I
[28:07] thank God the bride has headship today
[28:09] the bride to the to the bride there's a
[28:11] preeminent word that we have that that
[28:14] that controls what we do now there's so
[28:16] many voices today yeah so many voices
[28:21] yeah it's hard to identify the voice of
[28:25] God because there are so many different
[28:29] voices that we hear Brother brandom
[28:32] identifies the voice of pleasure yeah
[28:36] today we have influencers that wasn't
[28:38] something we had even when I was growing
[28:40] up but today we have influencers
[28:43] influencers what's an influencer their
[28:45] sole purpose is of existing is to be a
[28:50] voice right to influence
[28:52] others and they could influence them for
[28:55] good or influence them for bad right and
[28:58] everybody wants to have a show on
[29:00] YouTube everybody wants to be on
[29:03] Instagram right and I'm not preaching
[29:06] against those things there's nothing
[29:07] wrong with those things in themselves
[29:10] right but it's it's what people are
[29:11] doing with it and even young ladies will
[29:14] show off their bodies try to act cute on
[29:17] camera so men will notice them I even
[29:20] mothers will allow their young children
[29:22] uh 12 13 14 year old girls to get on
[29:25] there and and and show off their body
[29:28] and a bunch of perverts watching them
[29:29] and and it doesn't even it makes no
[29:32] sense why a mother why a parent that
[29:34] loves their child would allow that why
[29:37] would you allow that I'm not preaching
[29:38] it any you here none of you do that as
[29:40] far as I know but but it's the world
[29:42] that we live in
[29:43] today and our young men have to deal
[29:46] with that right right and some of them
[29:49] uh and the young men the way that they
[29:51] are and they dress now about as bad as
[29:53] the women do and you can't even tell
[29:55] which one's which by just looking at
[29:57] them yeah and even some of them claim to
[30:00] be Christians or be raised in Christian
[30:01] homes I think when someone says they're
[30:03] a Christian there's a voice to that
[30:05] there's a there's a distinctness to that
[30:07] that we listen to them a little more
[30:09] because they say well I'm a Christian
[30:10] Mom I'm a I run a Christian Channel I'm
[30:13] a Christian influencer but what are they
[30:15] influencing you to are they influencing
[30:17] you to the message of the hour are they
[30:19] influencing you to the right things are
[30:21] they influencing you to the
[30:23] world that voice is strong yeah it's a
[30:27] strong voice voice but I want to speak
[30:29] to you today especially our young people
[30:31] and those coming up but even those of us
[30:33] that are older because that pull those
[30:35] voices are everywhere they're so strong
[30:37] and I want to tell you you got to make
[30:39] time for the voice of God in your life
[30:41] you've got to make time to hear from
[30:43] from God you've got to make a space in
[30:46] your life to hear his voice and I don't
[30:48] care if you got to get rid of everything
[30:50] you've got that could connect to the
[30:51] internet I don't care what you have to
[30:53] do make sure you hear his voice yes sir
[30:57] on now yes sir you don't hear nothing
[30:58] else hear the voice of God I'm not
[31:00] talking about the voice of a man I'm not
[31:02] even just talking about tapes although
[31:03] you need to hear tapes we need to hear
[31:05] them today more than we ever did but
[31:07] that's not exactly what I'm talking
[31:09] about it's not just tapes it's not just
[31:11] it's not just your pastor it's not just
[31:13] something good music but it's the voice
[31:15] of God when he's speaking to you he can
[31:18] speak to you supernaturally individually
[31:21] yeah and you got to hear him say that
[31:24] yeah on Jason you got to hear the voice
[31:26] of God
[31:28] and for you to hear that voice it it
[31:30] requires you to not be pulled in by the
[31:33] voices of this hour am things like Tik
[31:37] Tok pull you in for hours and I I know
[31:39] it's not just the kids that deal with
[31:41] this that's right y'all just hang with
[31:43] me tonight pulls Us in for hours real
[31:46] after real after real it's a voice yeah
[31:48] it's an influence sir no wonder brother
[31:51] brandom cried so hard against Elvis
[31:52] Presley he was a voice but now every
[31:55] little teenage person can become
[31:58] can become Elvis Presley or or or uh any
[32:03] of the great singers that they had back
[32:05] then now everybody's got that kind of
[32:07] influence because of the ability of
[32:09] social media media I say if we've got it
[32:12] let's use it for good yeah let's use it
[32:14] for something positive keep the dirt off
[32:16] of it keep our politics off of it right
[32:20] preach the word on it how are you going
[32:22] to preach the word on it not by saying
[32:24] anything by just living your life if
[32:26] you're going to have it make sure that
[32:28] you live your life in the Holy Ghost
[32:30] kind of way that somebody say that's the
[32:31] kind of person I want to
[32:34] be yes even those voices which are not
[32:37] evil in themselves still drown out the
[32:39] voice of God yes but we need to make
[32:42] time to hear the voice of God yes if I
[32:45] was a young person listen to me church
[32:47] this we need to get real about these
[32:49] things and I'm stirred up tonight and I
[32:51] have been and the devil's been fighting
[32:53] me in my body and and but you know uh we
[32:57] we we got a group group of young people
[32:58] that need to hear from God you need to
[33:02] hear from God you old are young people
[33:03] you need to hear from God you need to
[33:06] hear the voice of God right he needs to
[33:08] speak to you and and direct your life

[33:12] you need to know that you got the
[33:13] baptism of the Holy Ghost you need to
[33:15] know that you can you step beyond that

[33:32] was a young person struggling with those
[33:34] things that I wasn't sure I had the
[33:35] baptism of the Holy Ghost I'd be at the
[33:37] altar because of the altar is a place
[33:39] where you can hear the voice of God it's
[33:42] a place that we set aside and with these
[33:44] meetings coming up I seek God with all
[33:46] of my heart because it's a time we set
[33:49] aside to put out all them other voices
[33:51] and let the voice of God let the voice
[33:53] of the supernatural speak again in our
[33:56] lives amen
[33:59] you've heard the voice of discouragement

[35:02] year olds look where you're coming to
[35:05] right you're coming to the age Jesus was
[35:08] when he went down to the
[35:09] temple and was about his father's
[35:12] business you can be about your father's
[35:15] business in
[35:17] church you can be about your father's
[35:19] business in school you can be about your
[35:22] father's business in the home you're not
[35:24] too young listen to me I was preaching
[35:26] at 12 years old I wasn't very good but I
[35:28] was
[35:31] preaching I'm not telling you that to
[35:33] you to push you into something like that
[35:34] but you can serve
[35:36] God huh you can serve God you can be
[35:39] close to God you can pray and you can
[35:41] pray through all right you can know what
[35:43] it's like to touch Heaven yeah you can
[35:45] know what it's like to feel the presence
[35:47] of God in your life you don't have to
[35:49] wait until some some other age but I'll
[35:51] say to you older ones are we've got
[35:52] older ones that are here with us and my
[35:54] my children Peter and Esther and and the
[35:56] different older ones that are here I'll
[35:58] say this that you're a helper in the
[36:00] church and we love that you help in the
[36:01] church we want you to help but you got
[36:03] to hear the voice of God for yourselves
[36:05] you've got to be do more than just
[36:07] assimilate into a church service you got
[36:09] to become the church and how you going
[36:11] to do that at some point you got to
[36:13] leave those voices behind I'm not
[36:15] listening to YouTube anymore I'm not
[36:17] listening to those things anymore I'm
[36:18] going to follow the voice of God yes sir
[36:22] yeah and I'm preaching to my own
[36:23] children tonight but to all of us maybe
[36:25] some of us adults need to hear it you
[36:27] didn't know it was going you service did
[36:28] you but but maybe some of us adults need
[36:30] to we need to hear his voice again we've
[36:32] heard every other voice we've heard the
[36:34] doctor's voice we've heard we've heard
[36:36] the guy down the road's voice you've
[36:37] heard all the you can get on the
[36:39] internet and search all the different
[36:40] pastors and all the message churches why
[36:42] don't you get hear his voice
[36:46] again amen nothing wrong with those
[36:49] things but make sure you hear his voice
[36:52] right sure it's not drowned out but the
[36:54] brand said Jesus at 12 was our example
[36:56] don't you know I should be about my
[36:58] father's business no wonder the voice of
[37:00] God is a rare thing today it's smothered
[37:02] out by so many different voices so many
[37:05] things that dim and take away it's got
[37:07] to a place till it dulls our senses
[37:09] until we can't hear the voice of God
[37:12] yeah oh my that's true oh if that was
[37:15] that way in
[37:17] 1958 can you imagine how much more today
[37:21] and brother bam talked about things they
[37:23] dealt with in his day and I talked about
[37:24] a few things we deal with today but but
[37:26] that's just where we live but Samuel was
[37:29] a 12-year-old boy according to
[37:31] Josephus when he was there in the temple
[37:34] and his his mother had brought him when
[37:36] he was weaned she had brought him up to
[37:38] the temple and dedicated his life to God
[37:41] you young people have been dedicated
[37:42] your lives have been dedicated to God
[37:44] your parents brought you up to be
[37:46] dedicated you you've been you've been
[37:48] given over committed to God yeah and yet
[37:51] he had to hear the voice of God and he
[37:53] was a prophet but the Bible says he
[37:55] didn't know God that's right and you got
[37:57] to get to where you know God you got to
[38:00] know him for yourself you got to have a
[38:02] personal relationship with him where he
[38:05] can talk to you like he did to Samuel
[38:07] yeah and he spoke to Samuel and Samuel
[38:10] didn't recognize that it was him because
[38:13] he'd not ever heard his voice before but
[38:15] when he spoke he answered it and it's a
[38:18] good thing when we hear the voice of the
[38:20] Lord to answer the voice of God now
[38:22] listen the voice of God has been dled
[38:24] but Samuel waited on the Lord when Eli
[38:26] told him he said go back and wait and
[38:29] lay back in your bed he went back and
[38:30] waited on the Lord when he called him he
[38:32] waited to hear what he had to say
[38:35] brother brand said men that Waits upon
[38:36] God comes into his
[38:38] presence I think we need to wait on God
[38:41] we don't in other words we don't need to
[38:42] get in such a hurry to get things done
[38:45] we need to hear from God and we need God
[38:48] to move in a supernatural way I I don't
[38:50] know about you but I need God
[38:51] Supernatural in my life because that's
[38:53] where the devil's fighting yes is in a
[38:56] supernatural Realm a lot of the battles
[38:58] that we fight in the natural are not
[38:59] really natural battles we're fighting
[39:02] them in the natural but really it's an
[39:04] influence of a supernatural realm and
[39:06] there's demons that are influencing
[39:08] people and you think you're you're
[39:10] battling with that person but really
[39:11] it's a devil that's influencing that
[39:13] spiritual wickedness in high places and
[39:15] so what's happening is in your life
[39:17] you're fighting carnal battles but we
[39:19] need a supernatural
[39:21] God right we need God to move in in a
[39:24] supernatural way and there's sometimes
[39:26] when you know and I believe we should do
[39:28] everything we can in the natural
[39:29] everything we know to do but when you
[39:31] don't know what else to do when you
[39:32] don't know what door to open when you
[39:34] don't know which way to turn you got to
[39:36] turn back to a supernatural God and
[39:38] believe he's able to keep you and have
[39:41] the faith to believe he'll answer you
[39:42] and speak to
[39:44] you see brother BR said man that Waits
[39:48] upon God comes into his presence yeah we
[39:51] need to come into His
[39:54] presence to come into the presence of
[39:56] God is just like going out early of the
[39:58] morning the Dew and the honeysuckles are
[40:00] all sweet he said when you come in the
[40:02] presence of a person like that you know
[40:06] they have been with God a person who's
[40:07] hard and angry all the time
[40:10] upset they they've just not been
[40:12] spending enough time with God sure right
[40:16] they may have been doing all the things
[40:17] necessary they might be reading their
[40:19] Bibles and listening to tapes and doing
[40:20] all the things necessary but they just
[40:22] haven't broke through that there's
[40:24] something holding them back yeah you
[40:26] realize our time with God is important
[40:28] yes you know when we have time with our
[40:30] children as parents you know we don't
[40:31] want to spend all our time on our phone
[40:33] we want to spend our time with our kids
[40:36] God help me I I'm the worst about that
[40:38] because I'll get a a text from somebody
[40:40] in the church or somebody overseas or
[40:42] somebody else and I'm always dealing
[40:44] with something and so you're always
[40:46] getting off of that or you're or or or
[40:48] just to be honest you're looking on
[40:49] Facebook Marketplace for something you
[40:51] want to buy right and you're supposed to
[40:53] be spending time with your kids and
[40:55] you're looking every other place except
[40:56] for doing that but you realize that what
[40:59] a what that does is your your children
[41:01] don't get to spend any time with you and
[41:03] and so you don't really get to know them
[41:05] you might be you might be physically
[41:07] doing the right things but have you
[41:09] surrendered your time to God to the
[41:12] point where you can sweeten up in his
[41:14] presence that's what I want to do I want
[41:16] to surrender my time to him take some
[41:18] time and surrender to him say Lord help
[41:20] me to be ready for these meetings coming
[41:22] up help me to be ready to go to work or
[41:24] whatever I have to do whatever you have
[41:26] to do help me be ready to do the thing
[41:28] that I need to do I need to be in your
[41:32] presence amen and if you don't think you
[41:35] need to be in his presence you just not
[41:37] haven't met him yet sir cuz if you ever
[41:40] spent five minutes in his presence you'd
[41:42] crave that the rest of your life all of
[41:45] your life your life would be empty until
[41:47] until you got back in his presence I
[41:49] told you I think last Wednesday night I
[41:51] just want God to move I want to see him
[41:53] move and I feel him and I know he's
[41:54] moving in our services but I want him to
[41:56] move that much more and how can we do
[41:58] that we need to get in his presence we
[42:00] need to shut out all the other voices
[42:02] and take the time that we need to take
[42:04] to come into contact with God
[42:07] again scrub all the old dust off and all
[42:10] the old all the old rust
[42:12] off right I that's uh I think my sister
[42:16] or somebody one time she had a a car
[42:18] that wouldn't start and and it just she
[42:21] thought she needed a new battery she
[42:22] needed this that or the other all she
[42:23] needed was the was the rust to be
[42:26] scrubed off the
[42:28] cables and tighten the thing up I think
[42:31] sometimes we just need a new connection
[42:33] we just we don't need that it's not that
[42:35] we don't have the Holy Ghost it's not
[42:36] that we're not children of God we just
[42:38] need a new connection we need to take
[42:39] the the wire brush and scrub some things
[42:41] out of our life and let God let the
[42:43] current start flowing again let God
[42:46] begin to move again because we need him
[42:48] more now than we ever had before true
[42:51] yes
[42:53] sir now
[42:55] look so many things to dull the senses
[42:58] of the people today he said oh in the
[43:00] midst of all that in spite of every
[43:03] dolling and every voice oh I'm so
[43:04] thankful for this today in spite of
[43:07] every Ding and every voice that's in the
[43:09] world today some of them pleasure voices
[43:11] some of them are sinful voices to lure
[43:13] the people but in the spite of every bit
[43:15] of that the truth of God Still Remains
[43:17] he that will hear my voice and come
[43:19] after me men and women who will hear the
[43:21] voice of God God still waits to speak to
[43:24] every someone say every every individual
[43:27] that will open their ears to hear God's
[43:30] voice you you say well he won't speak to
[43:32] me you don't realize brother Ben what
[43:33] I've done or what I've been no he'll
[43:35] speak to you if you'll open up your ears
[43:37] and give him time to
[43:41] speak I had this quote hanging in my
[43:43] office on my calendar one time here a
[43:46] while back said pastor don't you never
[43:49] get too busy what you can stay in the
[43:52] presence and listen for his
[43:55] Voice Hallelujah
[43:58] God always keeps his word he said no
[44:00] matter how bad the times may be how much
[44:02] your church May teach against it Jesus
[44:04] Christ is still willing to speak that
[44:07] still Small Voice to anybody that will
[44:10] listen for him listen to me young people
[44:12] he's willing to speak to you he said but
[44:13] I'm only 12 years old Samuel was only 12
[44:16] years old I'm only 11 years old he'll
[44:18] speak to an 11y old yeah let me ask you

[44:30] your mind he can talk to you sir if you
[44:33] just let him talk to you yes amen I know
[44:37] you can feel the presence of God I've
[44:38] seen even babies that can feel the
[44:40] presence of God there just something
[44:42] about it they can feel and know that
[44:44] he's there and I say every one of us
[44:45] need to need to be able to feel the
[44:47] presence of God I believe we can but we
[44:50] just need to learn how to respond to
[44:52] it as young people we need to learn how
[44:55] to respond to it if if we feel pull in
[44:57] our heart to come to the altar we need
[44:59] to do that if we feel a pull in our
[45:00] heart to raise our hand we need to do
[45:02] forget what your friends are doing
[45:03] forget what they're thinking about or
[45:05] what they might think about you just do
[45:07] what God tells you to do and you just
[45:09] get on fire you say well Mom and Dad
[45:10] don't do it I don't care what Mom and
[45:12] Dad do you need to hear the voice of God
[45:14] in your life there was a time when they
[45:16] needed to hear the voice of God yeah
[45:20] yes brother brand said
[45:22] every every one of you people who
[45:24] profess to be Christians get yourself
[45:26] quiet before him don't let the washing
[45:29] hinder don't let the work hinder don't
[45:31] let nothing hinder don't let nobody know
[45:33] what you're doing right so we don't have
[45:35] to post it all over the place what we're
[45:36] doing just go before him yes get up in
[45:39] the woods somewhere get out on the side
[45:41] of the road go into the secret closet
[45:43] and close the door when the kids get at
[45:45] school they go down on your knees you've
[45:48] heard all kinds of voices everywhere but
[45:50] just get down and stay there until those
[45:52] voices are silenced and you begin to
[45:54] lift up it'll change you it'll make you
[45:57] like it did this little Samuel I know
[45:59] sometimes we get under conviction we say
[46:00] Lord I need to be different how can we
[46:02] be different we need to come in the
[46:03] presence of God you've heard the word
[46:06] you just need to come in his
[46:08] presence now we continue to hear the
[46:10] word and preach the word but you need to
[46:12] come in the presence of God good Mo
[46:15] Moses was 80 years old when he heard his
[46:18] voice he saw a bush burning yes sir now
[46:22] you kids you know if you saw a bush on
[46:24] fire but it wasn't burning up you'd
[46:27] begin to turn aside because what he was
[46:29] seeing was something that was out of the
[46:31] natural Supernatural That's What
[46:33] Supernatural means something that's not
[46:35] normal something un happened some of you
[46:37] young people have been healed by God you
[46:39] know you felt bad and you come for
[46:40] prayer and you were healed well that's
[46:42] Supernatural you've seen your parents
[46:44] maybe maybe change and and what they
[46:46] were and what they become and that's a
[46:48] supernatural thing and they tell you
[46:50] their testimony it was a supernatural
[46:52] thing but you got to have the
[46:53] supernatural in your own life and you
[46:56] need to if there's a bush burning and
[46:58] it's not being consumed you need to look
[47:00] at it and see what it
[47:01] is right turn aside take a minute yes
[47:05] right you can't do that if you're just
[47:06] like this all the time
[47:13] right I'm having to be good
[47:15] tonight but for like this all the time
[47:17] how are we going to hear his
[47:20] voice right how are we going to do that
[47:23] you young people don't you just can't
[47:25] wait well when I get my first phone man
[47:26] that be the day I'll really oh hear his
[47:29] voice first and the phone won't be such
[47:32] a
[47:34] problem all right sir hear his voice
[47:37] yeah good you need to hear his voice you
[47:39] need to decide where you
[47:40] belong you need to go to the place where
[47:43] you know I'm a child of God and I belong
[47:45] to God and I might fail and I might fall
[47:48] and I might falter from time to time but
[47:50] I'm always coming back because I know
[47:52] I'm a Child of God I'm not going to try
[47:53] to hide my sin I'm not going to try to
[47:55] I'm not going to try to say well nobody
[47:57] knows what I'm doing but I'm just going
[47:58] to confess it and say Lord I'm I know
[48:00] I'm a child of yours I belong to you I'm
[48:02] going to move on I'm going to go forward
[48:05] I'm going to believe God yes Moses was
[48:08] 80 years old when he heard his voice so
[48:10] it works for us old people too just
[48:13] throw myself in there so no one gets
[48:15] offended he saw a bush burning but not
[48:17] consumed something Supernatural the
[48:20] presence of the burning bush made a
[48:22] different man out of Moses brother said
[48:24] five minutes in the presence of that
[48:26] bush changed Moses forever did more for
[48:29] him than taught him more about God than
[48:31] 80 years of teaching
[48:33] had right he said it'll make a different
[48:35] man and woman out of you if you'll just
[48:38] stand still long enough to hear his
[48:39] voice like Samuel did stand still don't
[48:42] be excited if you want something of God
[48:44] ask him then stand still and listen see
[48:46] what he's going to say about it just
[48:48] open up your heart and say what about it
[48:50] Lord Jesus just stay there if he doesn't
[48:52] answer the first five hours then wait
[48:55] another amen if he doesn't answer today
[48:58] he'll answer tomorrow if he doesn't
[48:59] answer this week he will next week stay
[49:01] there till he answers hear his voice
[49:04] speak back in your heart and say yes I'm
[49:08] the Lord that Health thee then it's all
[49:11] over you can settle then see I'm the
[49:13] Lord who forgives all thy sins go and
[49:15] sin no more I don't condemn you he said
[49:17] then you can go free you're all right
[49:19] but you want to be sure that you heard
[49:20] that voice
[49:21] speak Moses heard it he was a changed
[49:25] man
[49:27] listen when we find ourselves getting
[49:28] cold and indifferent we need another
[49:30] burning bush
[49:32] experience it would be okay for all of
[49:34] us to have that it'd be all
[49:38] right well I'm not an emotional person I
[49:41] didn't say you'd be emotional but you
[49:42] need to meet
[49:43] God yes I I'll be honest with you if I
[49:47] if I met God in a physical form today if
[49:50] if the Lord Jesus Christ walked up to me
[49:52] physically and I saw him and I knew it
[49:54] was him I tell you what I'd tell people
[49:56] about it
[49:57] you talk about somebody shouting and
[49:59] running and going
[50:01] places it wouldn't be like oh uh oh I
[50:04] forgot to tell you I saw God three weeks
[50:05] ago well where you been hiding him you
[50:09] know wouldn't be like that would it
[50:11] right if you met the
[50:13] president well maybe not this one
[50:16] but if you met a a president anyway that
[50:21] was that was competent you you'd go up
[50:25] to him and and You' talk to them and
[50:27] you'd say you know you know it's so nice
[50:30] to meet you you'd want your picture
[50:32] taken with them it probably wouldn't
[50:33] even matter what party they were you'd
[50:34] tell everybody I'd know about it
[50:36] tomorrow You' text me hey I talked to
[50:39] the president today I wonder if we could
[50:40] be like that about talking to God I
[50:43] talked to God today he was there with me
[50:45] I felt his presence I know things are
[50:47] going to be okay pastor I know I'm going
[50:49] to be all right because I talk to God
[50:52] today
[50:53] amen good found ourselves getting cold
[50:56] and different we need another burning
[50:57] bush experience to clear out all the
[50:59] draws so we can hear his voice again yes
[51:02] Isaiah was a young man when he heard his
[51:04] voice he was friends with King Uzziah
[51:07] who had a great influence over his life
[51:08] and he gave him everything he wanted but
[51:11] one day Uzziah died and that influence
[51:13] went away and in the year that King
[51:15] Uzziah died in Isaiah 61 he said I saw
[51:18] also the Lord sitting upon a throne high
[51:20] and lifted up and his train filled the
[51:22] temple above it stood the seraphim each
[51:24] one had six wings with 20 covered his
[51:27] face with Twain he covered his feet with
[51:29] Twain he did fly and one cried to
[51:31] another and said holy holy holy is the
[51:33] Lord of hosts the whole earth is full of
[51:35] his glory and the post of the door moved
[51:37] at the voice of him that cried and the
[51:39] house was filled with smoke and then
[51:40] said I woe is me for I am undone because
[51:44] I'm a man of unclean lips and I dwell in
[51:45] the midst of a people of unclean lips
[51:47] for my eyes to seen the king the Lord of
[51:49] hosts when you see somebody that claims
[51:51] to have been in the presence of God and
[51:52] they get more and more self-righteous do
[51:54] you know that they really haven't been
[51:57] because if you ever got in the presence
[51:59] of God you'd realize you need uh you
[52:01] need to be a cold to touch your lips you
[52:04] you need to be purified by in his
[52:07] presence amen you wouldn't be critical
[52:09] of the ministry you wouldn't be critical
[52:11] of other people you wouldn't spend your
[52:12] time running people down what would you
[52:14] do you get to business down to business
[52:16] with God say God I need to be purged I
[52:19] need to be
[52:21] changed amen yeah we don't we don't want
[52:25] to be self-righteous we want to be clean
[52:27] Isaiah got desperate that when you got
[52:29] desperate about this thing something
[52:31] will take place he said you're not
[52:32] desperate and I thought well I join
[52:34] church that settles it but you have to
[52:35] be desperate about it you have to really
[52:37] need God yes Jesus said blessed are they
[52:39] that do hunger and thirst after
[52:41] righteousness for they shall be F listen
[52:43] if you were hungry enough you would go
[52:46] get something to eat we're all
[52:48] Americans right we wouldn't just wait
[52:50] here until some food appeared we would
[52:53] go find food yeah if we got hungry
[52:55] enough some of y'all going to go down to
[52:57] McDonald's after church we're going to
[52:58] find food after church at McDonald's why
[53:01] because we get hungry we're human beings
[53:04] but there's something inside of you
[53:05] there's a thirst that God put there it's
[53:07] a thirst for him and we shouldn't fill
[53:10] that with things of the world but he
[53:12] said blessed are they that do hunger and
[53:14] thirst after righteousness for they
[53:15] shall be filled he said but as long you
[53:17] say why don't I thirst like that because
[53:19] you're satisfied with things of the
[53:21] world come on church I'm not just saying
[53:23] that about you I'm not trying to be mean
[53:25] to you tonight I'm preaching to us as a
[53:27] people I'm preaching to us as a as an
[53:30] age in a generation when when
[53:32] lukewarmness is everywhere and and once
[53:34] in a while we need to stir ourselves up
[53:36] again right and let God speak to us
[53:39] again yes yes amen long as you're
[53:44] satisfied with the things of the world
[53:45] how can God ever speak to you you say
[53:47] God never spoke to me why he wants
[53:52] to he's got an appointment
[53:57] on your calendar I got a calendar back
[53:58] there with people that I need to talk to
[54:00] and things I need to do and and and I
[54:02] look at that calendar and I think God
[54:04] wants to talk to me today yeah he wants
[54:07] to talk to you today are you going to
[54:09] give him time to talk are you going to
[54:12] give him time to talk are you going to
[54:14] are you going to let him talk to you how
[54:15] do I do that just lay the Bible before
[54:17] you and sit down and listen he'll talk
[54:20] to you begin to get on your knees and
[54:22] pray he'll talk to you tell him what you
[54:24] have need of and then stop and listen
[54:26] for him to speak he may not speak in an
[54:28] audible voice he may speak to your heart
[54:30] but somehow he'll speak yes sir oh my
[54:34] you said God you say God never spoke to
[54:36] me why he wants to but you're too filled
[54:39] up with the things of the world you're
[54:41] too full you don't want nothing to eat
[54:44] spiritually because you're so full
[54:46] because remember it all works in the
[54:47] same realm and Satan if he can fill you
[54:50] up and make you fat and happy and lay to
[54:52] see I don't mean physically I mean
[54:55] spiritually if he can do that then he
[54:58] knows you'll never you you'll never
[54:59] hunger for God and that's exactly where
[55:01] he wants you to
[55:02] be Isaiah 66 but blessed are those that
[55:06] hunger right blessed are those that
[55:08] hunger for they're the ones that's going
[55:10] to get
[55:11] filled then flew one of the seraphim
[55:13] unto me having a live coal in his hand
[55:15] which he had taken with the tong tongs
[55:17] from off the altar he laid it upon my
[55:19] mouth and said Lo this hath touched thy
[55:22] lips and thine iniquity is taken away
[55:25] and thy sin purg
[55:27] also I heard the voice of the Lord
[55:31] saying whom shall I send who will go for
[55:34] us then said I here am I send
[55:39] me who will go for us said the Voice who
[55:43] will go who is willing to stand in the

[58:42] that there's still Worship in the church
[58:44] right we watch the elders pass on and
[58:47] suddenly nobody says amen nobody
[58:48] worships I say it's about time we stood

[59:24] the powers of the Living God
[59:26] again well I'm glad I'm glad a prophet
[59:29] went in our day and I'm glad I'm glad
[59:33] people went before me I'm glad brother
[59:35] bisc
[59:36] went he's getting older now not
[59:38] preaching anymore glad the other
[59:40] brothers that have passed on they went
[59:43] I'm glad they went they're getting older
[59:45] who will go somebody's got to fill the
[59:48] role I refuse to believe that God don't
[59:51] have somebody
[59:53] that's right every one of us has a lived
[59:56] voice you say well I'm not I'll never be
[59:57] a preacher but every one of us has a
[59:59] lived voice brother Brandon said oh that
[1:00:01] Jeffersonville could have thousands of
[1:00:03] lived voices he said if you're a
[1:00:05] preacher preach the gospel get a Pulpit
[1:00:07] and preach but if you're not a preacher
[1:00:09] live your message live your message and
[1:00:12] and how do you live your message by
[1:00:14] becoming the word you can't live it
[1:00:16] unless you hear his
[1:00:18] voice amen Paul was about 30 years old
[1:00:23] when he heard his
[1:00:24] voice and act 9:4 he fell to the Earth
[1:00:27] and he heard a voice saying unto him
[1:00:28] Saul Saul why persecutest thou me he
[1:00:32] said who art thou Lord and the Lord said
[1:00:34] I am Jesus whom thou persecutest it is
[1:00:36] hard for thee to kick against the Pricks
[1:00:39] at High Noon he was knocked off his
[1:00:41] horse sounds like a western don't it and
[1:00:44] he found out his man-made religion was
[1:00:47] wrong the voice of God spoke to the
[1:00:49] pillar of fire and said Paul you're
[1:00:51] persecuting me come on now he said who
[1:00:53] are you he said I'm Jesus whom you're
[1:00:56] persecuting yes sir his name was changed
[1:00:59] that day from Saul to Paul he was sent
[1:01:02] to give his life preaching to people he
[1:01:04] wouldn't even eat with
[1:01:06] before right Gentiles Gentile dogs is
[1:01:09] what they called them but he gave his
[1:01:10] life preaching to them oh I'm so glad
[1:01:14] I'm so glad that there's an open Vision
[1:01:16] today I'm so glad we got something when
[1:01:18] we hear the voice of God we can go sir
[1:01:22] amen but now we got to hear the right
[1:01:24] voice make sure the CU the devil's
[1:01:27] always speaking so we don't just take
[1:01:29] any voice how do we know kids how do you
[1:01:31] know don't get bored yet I'm not
[1:01:34] done how do you know that the voice of
[1:01:37] God speaks to you how do you know you
[1:01:39] check it by the word right and all that
[1:01:42] means is is it in the
[1:01:44] Bible right is it have a foundation of
[1:01:46] scripture and then if it has a
[1:01:48] foundation of scripture did a prophet
[1:01:50] bring it out in the way that person is
[1:01:52] bringing it out that's important I don't
[1:01:54] mean you can't ever preach anything a
[1:01:55] proph didn't preach but what it means is
[1:01:57] it
[1:01:58] fits right the puzzle makes sense right
[1:02:01] with what a prophet said it's not
[1:02:03] contrary to what a prophet said right
[1:02:06] right and that's be that fits with the
[1:02:07] open vision and if your vision is
[1:02:09] contrary to the word you're listening to
[1:02:11] the wrong voice right don't care how
[1:02:13] powerful it was how strong it was or how
[1:02:14] much impressed you were if it's contrary
[1:02:17] to what God Said in the Bible what a
[1:02:19] prophet said it's wrong yeah right and
[1:02:22] but the Bible says my sheep hear my
[1:02:23] voice and I know them and they follow me
[1:02:26] and I give unto them eternal life they
[1:02:29] shall never perish aren't you glad for

[1:02:37] minutes
[1:02:38] tonight Peter heard his voice it made
[1:02:40] him eat differently right it changed his
[1:02:43] attitude towards the Gentile church he
[1:02:46] heard the voice of God when he saw that
[1:02:48] vision and or fell into that trance and
[1:02:50] and he saw the sheet and it had all
[1:02:52] kinds of all kinds of food on it and
[1:02:55] bacon and and ham and everything like
[1:02:57] that and he said oh no I've never eaten
[1:03:00] anything like that in my life but the
[1:03:02] voice answered me again from Heaven said
[1:03:05] what God has cleansed that call not thou
[1:03:09] common all right now let me say this we
[1:03:12] got to watch what we say about the
[1:03:13] church because there's a bigger point

[1:03:19] that's what he's cleansed you're the
[1:03:21] bride his church the bride don't call
[1:03:23] that common and unclean all right yeah

[1:03:46] call that Calon and unclean be careful
[1:03:48] what you say we get we get criticism
[1:03:50] sometimes for being too Pentecostal I
[1:03:52] don't know where that comes from good
[1:03:54] Lord we're not Pentecostal enough are
[1:03:57] we come on church sometimes I just wish
[1:03:59] I'd get an amen and people are
[1:04:01] criticizing me for being
[1:04:04] Pentecostal I mean come on it's just
[1:04:07] silly really people just don't listen
[1:04:09] they don't they don't pay attention but
[1:04:11] brother brandom says this about that he
[1:04:13] said God he said I wish he'd take a
[1:04:15] bunch of preachers in this Valley here
[1:04:17] let them know we're not crazy all right
[1:04:20] we're not Holy Rollers a bunch of trash
[1:04:22] it's the spirit of the Living God and
[1:04:24] men and women are drunk on his
[1:04:26] goodness it's not witchcraft or mental
[1:04:28] telepathy it's the spirit of the Living
[1:04:30] God he said turn loose of your
[1:04:32] Traditions elders and listen to the
[1:04:35] voice of the Living God it'll change you
[1:04:38] you won't become one of the persecutors
[1:04:40] you'll want to be one of
[1:04:42] them if you've been a persecutor you
[1:04:44] need to change sides
[1:04:47] yeah if you can pass the barriers of all
[1:04:49] your doctrines he said until you can
[1:04:51] float into his presence Yonder something
[1:04:53] will take place you won't believe the
[1:04:55] days of Miracles has passed you believe
[1:04:57] that they're right here cuz one will be
[1:04:59] performed on you sure to change a man
[1:05:02] yeah he said that's what that voice of
[1:05:03] God always does it changes men and women
[1:05:05] and makes them what they should be not
[1:05:07] what the schools and teachers has made
[1:05:09] but what God has pattered them for I say
[1:05:11] God let me hear your voice today let me
[1:05:13] be changed into what you want me to be
[1:05:18] Hallelujah brother brandom heard his
[1:05:20] voice when he was a child do you know
[1:05:22] that younger than probably anybody
[1:05:24] sitting here on the front row
[1:05:26] right brother Bram heard the voice of
[1:05:29] God he spoke brother Bram thought it was
[1:05:31] a bird talking to him that's how young
[1:05:34] he was in the tree or that there was a
[1:05:37] man in the tree he said the bird flew
[1:05:40] away so he thought there was a man in
[1:05:42] the tree and a voice spoke and said
[1:05:44] don't ever smoke or drink or defile your
[1:05:47] body with women because I got to work
[1:05:49] for you to
[1:05:50] do I believe you young people can hear
[1:05:53] the voice of God and I want that so bad
[1:05:55] sadly for my children hear that voice
[1:05:58] it's not just for brother brandom he was
[1:06:00] he had a special Ministry but you need
[1:06:02] to hear a voice that there's something
[1:06:03] for you to do it may not be his job but
[1:06:06] you do have a job you do have a place
[1:06:10] hear his voice said don't ever smoke or
[1:06:13] drink or defile your body they said oh
[1:06:15] he's just nervous and but but he

[1:06:19] voice today and remember what he told
[1:06:21] you sir so there's a work for you to do
[1:06:23] when you get older Lazarus heard his
[1:06:27] voice amen he heard his voice in John

[1:06:34] roll the stone away and he cried with a
[1:06:35] loud voice

[1:07:01] Ben he can't talk to me he can't talk to
[1:07:03] me I've got all these know it was so
[1:07:06] powerful amen that if he hadn't said

[1:07:12] Lazarus in another dimension all
[1:07:14] right doing whatever they do over there
[1:07:17] he's over there enjoying himself and as

[1:07:43] would be the final voice to the final
[1:07:45] age what where is his voice today not in
[1:07:47] that body that stood there but it's in
[1:07:49] this body in your body it's in the body
[1:07:52] of his Believers yes that's where that
[1:07:55] powerful voice is yes I think we ought
[1:07:58] to speak I think we ought to speak the
[1:08:00] words of God listen to Spirit of the
[1:08:03] Bride say come let him that hear us say
[1:08:05] come let him that is a thirst come

[1:08:09] Life freely yes oh my listen the BR said
[1:08:13] I was dead once in sin and trespasses
[1:08:15] you were dead in sin and trespasses but
[1:08:18] it was the voice of God it said come
[1:08:20] unto me all you that labor and are heavy
[1:08:21] laden I will give you rest aren't you
[1:08:23] glad you heard that voice
[1:08:26] amen I've seen the voice speak to the
[1:08:28] straighten him up he said I've
[1:08:30] seen the voice of God speak to the Blind
[1:08:33] and his eyes come open to the dying
[1:08:37] cancer ridden to the leper see them
[1:08:40] return back in flesh in the perfect
[1:08:42] health again I've seen him speak to the
[1:08:44] alcoholics and neurotics and the offcast
[1:08:47] and the skidrow bunch and they become
[1:08:49] ladies and gentlemen and Saints of the
[1:08:50] Living God because the voice of God
[1:08:52] spoke he said that's what we listen for
[1:08:54] today do you realize what God did in our
[1:08:57] day you realize what he did he spoke his
[1:09:00] voice was spoken again it was spoke why
[1:09:03] did he speak in our day because he
[1:09:05] didn't want us to look back at that
[1:09:07] leper that was cleansed in the Bible and
[1:09:09] say well it just happened back then but
[1:09:10] he wanted us to know he's the same
[1:09:12] yesterday today and forever that he
[1:09:15] never changes he wanted us to know
[1:09:17] brother b b said my Ministry is to show
[1:09:19] that he's here he's here and where he is
[1:09:22] anything is possible amen hallelujah oh
[1:09:26] if he can come in the room anything is
[1:09:29] possible I I hope you're hearing me now
[1:09:32] anything is possible when he comes in
[1:09:35] the room said I've seen you speak to the
[1:09:37] alcoholics and neurotics and the offcast
[1:09:39] and skidrow bunch become ladies and
[1:09:40] gentlemen of saints to the Living God
[1:09:42] because the voice of God spoke that's
[1:09:44] what we listen for today one day all
[1:09:45] will hear his voice John 5:28 Marvel not
[1:09:48] at this for the hour is coming in the
[1:09:50] which all that are in the graves someone
[1:09:52] say
[1:09:54] all all will hear his voice but
[1:09:58] listen how they hear that voice and what
[1:10:02] they come up to depends on how they
[1:10:05] responded here on the
[1:10:07] Earth right our response to the word
[1:10:11] matters right in our lives and our
[1:10:13] actions and our in our voices in fact
[1:10:16] that's the brother BR thought is the
[1:10:17] evidence of the Holy Ghost was saying
[1:10:19] Amen to every word that that's that's
[1:10:21] what it it identifies it in our life not
[1:10:23] that we'll not that you have to say Amen
[1:10:25] to every word I say but but you agree
[1:10:27] with every word of God
[1:10:29] yeah today if you'll hear his voice
[1:10:31] you'll be identified yes in the first
[1:10:34] resurrection oh my oh my oh my
[1:10:37] Revelation 20 and6 says blessed and holy
[1:10:39] is he that hath part in the First
[1:10:42] Resurrection on such the second death
[1:10:45] hath no power but they shall be Priests
[1:10:48] of God and of Christ shall reign with
[1:10:49] him a thousand years what was it he said
[1:10:51] back in John 5:29 he said shall come
[1:10:53] forth they that have done good to the
[1:10:55] resurrection of life that have done evil
[1:10:57] to the resurrection of damnation
[1:10:59] everyone of in the graves when they hear
[1:11:01] his voice will raise they will raise but
[1:11:06] when they raise and how they raise oh I
[1:11:08] don't want to raise in this old body I
[1:11:10] want to raise in a new body I don't want
[1:11:13] to be judged for my actions I want to be
[1:11:15] I want to be standing there as his bride
[1:11:17] as his
[1:11:18] wife how do I do that by hearing his
[1:11:20] voice yes today and responding to that
[1:11:24] voice Samuel responded to the voice that
[1:11:26] he heard Speak
[1:11:28] Lord no
[1:11:31] suspicion no criticism
[1:11:34] speak speak Lord yeah wonder if we could
[1:11:38] respond that way when we hear preachers
[1:11:40] come in and preach the words of God if
[1:11:43] we just say Speak
[1:11:44] Lord I won't Channel this through my
[1:11:47] blinders and how I want to see it but I
[1:11:50] want whatever you've got for me speak
[1:11:52] for thy servant heareth sir why did he
[1:11:55] respond he' made up his mind that was
[1:11:57] the voice of God he had confidence that
[1:11:59] was God's voice yeah I trust today we
[1:12:02] have confidence the message of the hour
[1:12:04] yes is God speaking to us whether it's
[1:12:08] spoken through a prophet or through
[1:12:10] Ministry or however it's the the message
