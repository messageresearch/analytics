[41:25] beyond a man or his ability or inability
[41:28] God that we can look to you today and we

[42:28] worship of the Lord that song the
[42:32] bloodline is one of my favorite songs

[42:54] and verse 1 also I wanted to say that
[42:57] we've been attending meetings over
[42:58] brother IVs and you know I think
[43:00] sometimes we look at things wrong I I
[43:02] think that we should be grateful to be
[43:05] in an area where there's meetings and
[43:06] other message people and churches and
[43:08] places we can go and and attend meetings
[43:11] when we can't have them ourselves and
[43:13] and be able to fellowship with our
[43:15] brothers and sisters and I'm grateful
[43:17] some of you got to come and and I've
[43:19] been listening to good preaching the
[43:21] last couple days so I'm not sure if I
[43:23] can come up quite that quality but but
[43:26] the word is still the word and it's
[43:28] still good but we got to here for the
[43:29] Andrew yesterday twice and for the
[43:32] Andrew Glover and I talked to him about
[43:34] coming back he's gonna be back in the
[43:35] area in late June so maybe you can come
[43:38] by and and speak to us again so we'll be
[43:40] looking forward to that and and the Lord
[43:42] willing if everything works out and
[43:44] we'll have some other maybe some other
[43:46] brothers in for the church this summer

[43:51] Lord no matter who's bringing it but my
[43:53] heart was just really thrilled by the
[43:56] word that we heard this weekend and
[43:58] we're gonna try to go back over today

[44:10] better no place I would rather be than

[44:15] like home and just as much as you've
[44:16] given me the opportunity to speak to you
[44:18] over the last few months and I'm so
[44:20] grateful for that Acts chapter 2 and
[44:23] verse 1
[44:25] and when the day of Pentecost was fully

[44:48] filled with the Holy Ghost and began to
[44:51] speak with other tongues as the Spirit
[44:53] gave them utterance I pray the Lord
[44:56] would add his blessing to the word you
[44:58] may be seated
[44:59] this morning good to have my mother with
[45:02] us she come up for the meetings and
[45:03] wrote over with us this morning so we
[45:06] thankful for that it's good to have her
[45:08] this morning we've been talking about
[45:10] the abstract and and going through it
[45:15] examining it to see what it is and we
[45:19] found as I've said multiple times I keep
[45:21] referring back so that we don't forget
[45:23] the the continuity of it we found that
[45:26] the original owner was God and what
[45:29] comes from God can go back to God
[45:31] always remember that because there's
[45:34] going to be times in your life that you
[45:36] feel like that you've you just should
[45:38] give up and that there's nothing for you
[45:40] that that God's given up on you and
[45:42] people have given up on you remember if
[45:44] you come from God you can go back to God
[45:48] nothing can happen in the in the
[45:51] meantime that can take you out of his
[45:53] hand because when I Adam lost the title
[45:57] deed to the earth where did it go right
[45:58] back in his hands so Adam and Eve
[46:01] forfeited the title and goes right back
[46:04] in his hands we found there was a lamb
[46:06] came that that brought a propitiation
[46:09] for our sins that was a propitiation for
[46:12] our sins that we could we could have a
[46:15] way back into that chain of title if we
[46:18] could put it that way we could have a
[46:20] way back into Dominion that was ours and
[46:23] to have eternal life and so the lamb
[46:26] came to do that and he clears the title
[46:29] by his death on the cross and so and and
[46:33] by by conquering and being victorious
[46:36] over death then he proved
[46:38] was and that he was one that would as
[46:41] cautions to 14 puts it blotted out the
[46:44] handwriting of Ordinances that was
[46:46] against us we went through that how that
[46:48] that was the the deed or the mortgage
[46:51] that was on the land that piece of paper
[46:53] that showed our sin and showed that we
[46:57] had no rights and to the land and he
[47:00] blotted that out and he not only blotted
[47:03] it out but he took it out of the way and
[47:05] he nailed it to his cross so I want us
[47:10] to live this morning in in Ephesians 1
[47:12] and 3 and we continue we realized that
[47:15] the property has got to come back in our
[47:19] hands if we can make it personal this
[47:22] morning that the title debilitating to
[47:24] the earth has got to come back in my
[47:26] hands it's got to come into possession
[47:30] personally and it's got to be more than
[47:32] just an abstract thought that that God
[47:35] died at Christ died for us but it's got
[47:37] to be a reality in our lives that the
[47:41] abstract that we have that Dominion and
[47:44] we have that ability to speak the word
[47:47] and that we have the ability to overcome
[47:49] sin that we have the ability to live a
[47:52] victorious life and to live the life of
[47:54] Christ even in a horrible age even in an
[47:57] age of Laodicea
[47:58] but the Curtis we have the ability to
[47:59] live for God even in this age aren't you
[48:03] grateful that you serve a God that that
[48:06] didn't just leave you and and didn't
[48:08] just let you figure it out on your home
[48:10] but he gave you his spirit so that you
[48:12] can live in this hour you wouldn't have
[48:15] to do it all on your own but you'd have
[48:17] him and even when when and God gave us
[48:21] ministers he gives us he gives us
[48:23] pastors he gives us evangelists he gives
[48:25] us church family and people but even
[48:27] when everybody else is gone he's still
[48:30] there we found that out to this time of
[48:34] social distancing and isolation all
[48:37] these things we found out God still
[48:39] there he's still alive he didn't go away
[48:42] he's still the same and he still
[48:44] operates the same even when it's just us
[48:48] now the the
[48:52] the conveyance had to be made and in
[48:54] ephesians 1 he speaks about this title
[48:58] if we could put it that way and how we
[48:59] get these these blessings from God and
[49:01] this this right to the blessings of the
[49:06] promises of God and he said blessed be
[49:08] the God and father of our Lord Jesus
[49:10] Christ who hath blessed us with all
[49:12] spiritual blessings in heavenly places
[49:14] in Christ according as he have chosen us
[49:18] in him before the foundation of the
[49:21] world
[49:22] that's the original owner he chose us in
[49:26] him that's why it's not hard for us to
[49:30] follow the word and to do the things the
[49:32] word requires because he chose us in him
[49:35] we're just part of it
[49:37] we're just part of the word it's not a a
[49:40] dreary thing or something well the
[49:42] church makes me do this or or this just
[49:44] no it's not illegal ISM but it's the
[49:46] reality of we're part of him if we're
[49:50] part of the word it's easy to follow the
[49:52] word and so we find that he's chosen us
[49:55] in him before the foundation of the
[49:56] world that we should be holy that we
[49:58] should be holy and without blame before
[50:02] him in love having predestinated us unto
[50:07] the adoption of children I love the way
[50:11] Paul puts that that he has predestinated
[50:13] us unto the adoption of children so
[50:16] there's a purpose to our predestination
[50:18] it's not just to be predestinated
[50:21] minister to be the adoption of children
[50:23] by Jesus Christ to himself so he's
[50:26] bringing us back into a place where we
[50:31] can have we can have a special a special
[50:35] status an ability to stand there as sons
[50:39] and daughters of God even though it
[50:41] seems like and you know we get to use to
[50:44] this world can I just talk to you a
[50:46] minute about it we get to use to this
[50:48] world we get to used to being able to
[50:51] touch things and and not being able to
[50:53] move them and and things happen in our
[50:56] lives we can't do anything about and so
[50:58] we think that's just the way that it is
[51:00] but remember God is able to do what you
[51:03] can't do
[51:06] but God wants to work through us and so
[51:09] Paul says I can do all things through
[51:12] Christ which strengtheneth me I can do
[51:15] all things I can overcome sickness I can
[51:19] overcome disease I can overcome old age
[51:22] I can overcome the world that I'm living
[51:26] in are you with me this morning I can
[51:28] overcome to hear to see it I can do all
[51:30] things why he lives in me and so he
[51:34] wants to live in me and and walk in me
[51:37] and work in me and he's predestinated me
[51:40] to do that he's predestinated us unto
[51:42] the adoption of children by Jesus Christ
[51:44] to himself according to the good
[51:47] pleasure of his will so it wasn't by our
[51:50] wheel it was not him that runneth or or
[51:52] of him that wills but it's him that God
[51:56] chose we ought to be so thankful to just
[52:01] heard the message of the hour we ought
[52:04] to be so thankful to be able to be
[52:06] associated with it
[52:07] sure we have problems sure we have
[52:10] situations in life but we ought to be so
[52:12] thankful that we have heard the word and
[52:15] millions didn't hear it and then there
[52:18] were many that heard that couldn't
[52:20] respond to it they just couldn't make
[52:22] themselves
[52:23] we even maybe had family members and
[52:25] people that just couldn't make
[52:26] themselves respond to it but here you've
[52:28] responded to it yes you've had trouble
[52:30] yes you've had trials yes you've been
[52:32] you've had war he said yes you've
[52:34] spilled stressed out it down but there's
[52:36] something in you that responds to the
[52:38] word there's something in you that just
[52:41] once or I may have messed up I may have
[52:43] been things that I didn't want to do and
[52:46] it was a gifts to her but yet there's
[52:48] something in me as if the word is true
[52:52] the word is true amen
[52:56] why because he predestinated me and to
[52:59] the adoption of children hallelujah to
[53:04] the praise of the glory of His grace I
[53:08] love that to the praise of the glory of
[53:10] His grace worry and he has made us
[53:12] accepted in the beloved he has made us
[53:17] accepted
[53:19] in the beloved sometimes in church it
[53:22] seems like we just don't fit in but he
[53:25] has made us accepted in the beloved
[53:27] oh they ought to make us love one
[53:31] another shouldn't it he has made us
[53:33] accepted in the beloved not that I make
[53:35] brother Sam accepted but he has made you
[53:38] accepted not that I've made brother
[53:40] David accepted but he made you accepted
[53:42] her mister Mary any of you he's made you
[53:45] accepted in the beloved if he has made
[53:47] you accepted it didn't matter what
[53:49] anybody else says I'm accepted in the
[53:53] beloved oh we get to we're too careful
[53:55] about what people think and say if I
[53:57] read yesterday and I've been pondering
[53:59] this where brother Brown was going to
[54:01] Africa and he was going to he was going
[54:03] to go there but he he had a certain
[54:06] thing that he felt led to do and he knew
[54:08] what's right to do he had a vision to do
[54:10] it and here were these ministers that
[54:12] were telling him don't do that you can't
[54:13] do that you got to keep this obligation
[54:15] you can't go on the signing trip you
[54:16] you've got to keep this meeting him
[54:18] these ministers were putting pressure on
[54:20] him and brother Ram said even brother
[54:22] Bosworth who's a great man of God but he
[54:26] stood there and pressured brother
[54:27] branham said no that's not the will of
[54:29] God this is the will of God I said it
[54:32] must have even been a false vision and
[54:35] brother Bosworth staying there telling
[54:36] him that but brother Brown said what it
[54:38] taught him is that he couldn't trust in
[54:40] the arm of any flesh because for the
[54:44] Bosworth's believe was even the oak tree
[54:46] that he said under and it taught him
[54:49] that he could oh my he could not he
[54:53] could not trust any flesh but he had to
[54:56] trust the leadership for the Holy Ghost
[54:57] and I think that's where we're at this
[55:00] morning we need to realize he has made
[55:02] us accepted no matter what anybody else
[55:05] says I'm not gonna let and don't take
[55:07] this wrong but I'm not gonna let your
[55:09] your thoughts about me keep me out of
[55:11] the house of God I'm not gonna let your
[55:14] thoughts about me or so what else does
[55:15] thoughts you should let someone else's
[55:16] thoughts about you keep you out of the
[55:18] house of God but say lord help me to be
[55:21] help me to realize that I'm completing
[55:24] you I'm not complete than just with
[55:27] everybody else but I'm completing you
[55:29] and that makes me accepted in the
[55:30] beloved
[55:34] because I don't always know the will of
[55:36] God for your life and sometimes we speak
[55:41] and if you ask me a question or if I'd
[55:43] ask one of these brothers a question
[55:44] maybe an older brother say brother what
[55:46] do you think the will of God is he could
[55:47] tell me what he thinks but that may not
[55:50] be the will of God for me and so you
[55:55] have to find the will of God for
[55:57] yourself because you were accepted in
[56:00] the beloved and so we've got to be
[56:03] careful about that but remember someone
[56:05] may do something that we don't think is
[56:06] is right maybe not sinful but just
[56:08] something that we think they do
[56:09] something anything well we think well
[56:11] that's just the wrong thing to do but
[56:12] remember they're accepted in the beloved
[56:15] not us and it may prove to be that they
[56:19] followed the will of the Lord it may
[56:20] prove to me that they didn't but they're
[56:23] accepted in the beloved according by the
[56:25] grace of God are you with me this
[56:28] morning now he's showing us that title
[56:32] could not be completely lost because we
[56:36] are the elect children of the original
[56:39] owner he been he made us and he we are
[56:45] his children we belong to him
[56:47] some nothing a man could do can take us
[56:52] out of his hand
[56:55] you hear me this morning nothing a man
[56:58] could do or a woman could do or any our
[57:01] family could do anybody else could take
[57:02] us out of his hand we belong to him we
[57:07] don't belong to him plus someone else we
[57:09] don't belong to him plus plus all the
[57:11] the ministry plural him plus a church or
[57:14] him plus another person we belong to him
[57:18] we belong to him and so title could not
[57:21] be lost because we are a select children
[57:24] officiants 1:7 in whom we have
[57:27] redemption through his blood the
[57:29] forgiveness of sins according to the
[57:32] riches of His grace oh that's his
[57:36] profession he made a way for say wherein
[57:40] he has abounded toward us in all wisdom
[57:43] and prudence having made known unto us
[57:46] mystery of his will according to his
[57:50] good pleasure which he hath purposed in
[57:53] himself and that just brings it all away
[57:57] from us doesn't it
[57:58] that's pretty ironclad it was nice I'll
[58:02] be honest with you mentally I have a
[58:05] hard time and a lot of people do with
[58:07] the doctrine of election but it's the
[58:10] truth
[58:10] it's not true because I can put it
[58:13] together it's true because the Bible
[58:15] says that it is I have a hard time
[58:18] wrapping my mind around a God who could
[58:20] choose me just for starters one thing
[58:24] will take you to somebody else one thing
[58:27] for him choose brother branham he chose
[58:28] me I was in his mind and I have a hard
[58:33] time wrapping my mind around a God that
[58:36] could do that but yet he said he did it
[58:39] he has a right to do it you might look
[58:42] at your family or you might my kids
[58:45] might look at me and say how can the
[58:46] Walker we have a dad like that so
[58:48] wonderful and caring and nice or they
[58:54] might look at me as a how in the world
[58:56] we have a dad like that it's on to us
[59:00] all the time doesn't give us everything
[59:01] we want that makes us share a drink when
[59:05] we go to the McDonald's and awful
[59:09] parenting right there but you know they
[59:13] don't they can't help that they're my
[59:14] children they belong to me I'm
[59:19] responsible for where is children I'm
[59:25] thankful for the freedom of the Spirit
[59:27] that we feel here this morning it's just
[59:28] wonderful but I'm just preaching to him
[59:31] where his children we belong to him we
[59:34] don't have to worry about about whether
[59:36] he's gonna give up on us or not you
[59:37] don't give up on your children well yes
[59:42] we belong to him and because of that he
[59:45] has the ability he has the ability to
[59:47] make us and inform us into his will and
[59:50] and to cause us to come to him to put it
[59:52] as hired us to come to him why we belong
[59:55] to him we're his children he had a right
[59:57] to have children and his children
[1:00:00] belong to him according he said to the
[1:00:03] good pleasure which he hath purposed in
[1:00:05] himself that in the dispensation of the
[1:00:08] fullness of times he might gather
[1:00:11] together in one all things in Christ
[1:00:14] both which are in heaven which are on
[1:00:17] earth even in him in whom also we have
[1:00:21] obtained an inheritance he said he
[1:00:24] preached too much about Christ preached
[1:00:26] too much about the person of Jesus
[1:00:28] Christ well Paul did look what he says
[1:00:31] in whom also in him and one we're giving
[1:00:34] one all things in Christ in whom also we
[1:00:37] have obtained an inheritance being
[1:00:38] predestinated of course according to the
[1:00:40] purpose of him and worketh all things
[1:00:43] after the counsel of his own will hey
[1:00:46] man that we should be to the praise of
[1:00:49] his glory who first trusted in Christ
[1:00:53] now I want to stop there and we'll come
[1:00:55] back into Ephesians chapter one later
[1:00:57] but brother Brent says now he said now
[1:01:00] the same thing as this if you're a son
[1:01:02] of God and if I am a son of God or a
[1:01:04] daughter of God we were in God at the
[1:01:07] beginning and when Jesus became the
[1:01:10] fullness of the word then we were in him
[1:01:12] jerem for when he was crucified we was
[1:01:16] crucified in his body
[1:01:17] when he rose from the dead we rose with
[1:01:20] him and now since we have recognized it
[1:01:23] now we sit together with him in heavenly
[1:01:27] places in Christ Jesus sometimes don't
[1:01:31] feel like heavenly places we stop
[1:01:32] talking about your fleshly position he's
[1:01:35] talking about your seed the seed he's
[1:01:37] talking about you and your spiritual
[1:01:39] condition you said in heavenly places in
[1:01:42] Christ Jesus he said for we if we are
[1:01:46] sons and daughters of God we are God's
[1:01:48] children then we are attributes of God
[1:01:52] then we got eternal life and God is the
[1:01:55] only eternal life there is then we were
[1:01:58] in him from the beginning
[1:01:59] and when Jesus listened became all that
[1:02:02] word then we were a part of him then
[1:02:06] they been he said there you are that's
[1:02:10] in there he said there is no devil no
[1:02:13] powers
[1:02:14] no nothing can ever move it that's the
[1:02:17] type oast of the soul Oh bye
[1:02:20] isn't that wonderful and that wonderful
[1:02:23] at the origin didn't come tell us that
[1:02:25] God sent a prophet to tell us these
[1:02:27] things
[1:02:27] that's the tide post of the soul he said
[1:02:30] listen he said there's one thing I can't
[1:02:33] do
[1:02:34] I can't brag on my ancestors he said no
[1:02:38] he said I come through an awful mess I
[1:02:41] put these notes together and in fact I
[1:02:43] didn't know my mother would be here this
[1:02:44] morning but but still it's true we can't
[1:02:48] brag on their ancestors none of us can i
[1:02:51] brag on my mom but very few others he
[1:02:55] said I can't brag on my ancestors no I
[1:02:57] come to an awful mess
[1:02:59] my father was an Irishman my mother was
[1:03:01] an half Indian he said her mother was an
[1:03:03] Indian drawed a pension he said now all
[1:03:05] of them drunks most all of them died
[1:03:07] with their shoes on fighting gunfighters
[1:03:09] and so forth I can't brag on nothing
[1:03:12] about that because my ancestors and my
[1:03:14] family tree is terrible that's a prophet
[1:03:19] of God your God pre-planned that God
[1:03:26] three planned listen to this God three
[1:03:30] planned brother bana much terrible
[1:03:32] family tree think about that for a
[1:03:37] moment he said my family tree is
[1:03:40] terrible but brother Bible said God from
[1:03:42] generations back cause one person to
[1:03:44] meet another so the brother Brandon
[1:03:48] would be a certain way Oh church he
[1:03:52] didn't just do that for a prophet he did
[1:03:54] that for you you might look at your
[1:03:57] family tree see my family tree is
[1:03:58] terrible but that's what brother Brown
[1:04:00] could say my family tree is terrible but
[1:04:02] God allowed that God caused that to
[1:04:06] happen the way that it did by his
[1:04:09] omniscience by his sovereignty he said
[1:04:14] so my family tree is terrible terrible
[1:04:16] but brother there's one thing I can brag
[1:04:19] on I can brag on my Lord Jesus Oh can't
[1:04:24] we brag on him today that's what we want
[1:04:26] to brag on wanna brag
[1:04:27] preacher we don't wanna brag on the
[1:04:28] singer we don't want a bag on a church
[1:04:30] we want to back on the Lord Jesus
[1:04:31] there's one thing that I can brag on I
[1:04:34] can brag on my Lord Jesus who's redeemed
[1:04:36] me hallelujah aren't you glad you've
[1:04:39] been redeemed by the blood of the Lamb
[1:04:41] we can sing I've been redeemed by the
[1:04:43] blood of the Lamb
[1:04:44] amen why because I can brag on him and
[1:04:48] with this transforming power planted a
[1:04:51] seed by predestination and I saw it
[1:04:55] hey man whose son am I now Oh think
[1:05:01] about that for a moment whose son am I
[1:05:03] now my natural birth you might have come
[1:05:06] up under a certain image that made you a
[1:05:08] certain way of course you'd have certain
[1:05:10] attributes certain characteristics but
[1:05:12] whose son am I now I'm not bound to what
[1:05:17] my father did I'm not bound what my
[1:05:20] grandfather was I'm not bound to what my
[1:05:23] my mother's family my father's family
[1:05:25] was I'm not bailed you're not bound to
[1:05:27] what your family was but you can be a
[1:05:29] son or daughter of God fully live a
[1:05:31] Christian life you could be free from
[1:05:33] sin you can be redeemed by the blood of
[1:05:35] the Lamb
[1:05:36] I preached a sermon one time called my
[1:05:39] father's damaged jeans and it wasn't
[1:05:43] that he had jeans that holds it on
[1:05:46] button but his jeans his genetics but I
[1:05:49] wasn't just my dad's everybody all of us
[1:05:54] had item speaking thereof Adam my father
[1:05:58] Adam had was damaged and he passed on
[1:06:01] those damaged genes and there was even
[1:06:04] Sir Percy to come in the world and all
[1:06:06] the things that happened him and we find
[1:06:09] that everything was so mixed up we were
[1:06:12] without God without hope in the world
[1:06:13] but God had planted a seed down on the
[1:06:16] inside of us and one day we saw it so we
[1:06:21] can say whose son am I now
[1:06:23] hey Ben I can brag on him you know
[1:06:31] forgive me for a moment we do way too
[1:06:33] much social engineering or on the
[1:06:35] message we want a certain person to be
[1:06:39] grow up a certain way in a church
[1:06:40] maybe the third or fourth message
[1:06:42] generation believer and generation
[1:06:44] message believer and and they're gonna
[1:06:46] get married a certain person we want to
[1:06:48] engineer that and cause them to go and
[1:06:50] always everything and if everything's
[1:06:52] not always been perfect with somebody we
[1:06:53] we we greet that with suspicion but see
[1:06:56] God doesn't work like that sometimes God
[1:06:59] can bring someone and you watch and
[1:07:01] bring someone out of the world cause
[1:07:03] them to sit among us and here comes a a
[1:07:04] son of God or daughter of God and
[1:07:06] they'll come and get saved and that
[1:07:07] those people will get married and have a
[1:07:09] wonderful family God did that now not
[1:07:12] that they should marry someone in the
[1:07:13] world but God can bring someone out of
[1:07:14] the world God can bring some out of
[1:07:19] denominations God can we try to engineer
[1:07:21] it where we have the best ties players
[1:07:23] and the best ability to do certain
[1:07:25] things God doesn't do that
[1:07:28] God doesn't he did not choose you
[1:07:30] because of the size of your bank account
[1:07:33] he didn't choose you because you were
[1:07:35] you were just everything was just
[1:07:37] perfect in your life but he chose you
[1:07:39] because you were his hey men you were
[1:07:46] part of him no but the premise says I
[1:07:52] saw it whose son of mine now yeah I can
[1:07:55] brag on him
[1:07:55] and I've spent 33 years of my life
[1:07:58] bragging on him if he would spare me
[1:08:00] another 33 years I'll try to prank or on
[1:08:02] him
[1:08:03] I can brag on my ancestry hallelujah
[1:08:06] either redeem me and planted the seed of
[1:08:09] life in here let me look down upon this
[1:08:11] word sit down his spirit and said here
[1:08:13] it is speak this and it'll happen
[1:08:18] I gotta settle down I've been in
[1:08:22] meetings but the Andrew I can't look at
[1:08:27] him and I think my it's good to be young
[1:08:28] you know I'm not very old but I think I
[1:08:32] think he's 23 or something like that I
[1:08:34] think my you just run all over the plate
[1:08:36] just wait you know until you get you
[1:08:38] feel like the old man on the lawn you
[1:08:40] get off my lawn but I can still brag on
[1:08:44] him hey man I can still brag on to him
[1:08:48] but the best I've been bragging on him
[1:08:50] for 33 years
[1:08:51] I can still brag on him I first come in
[1:08:53] this area and started preaching
[1:08:54] was 20 years ago I'm still bragging on
[1:08:56] him I can still brag on him I can't brag
[1:08:59] about nothing in my own
[1:09:00] I can't brag on nothing that I've done
[1:09:01] but I can brag on him can we do that
[1:09:04] today we can brag on him hey Ben
[1:09:08] he said speak this and it will happen he
[1:09:12] said he'd come down sit this bit look
[1:09:15] let me look down upon this word send
[1:09:17] down his spirit and said here it is
[1:09:18] speak this and it will happen do that he
[1:09:22] said oh my I can brag on him
[1:09:25] Ephesians 1:13 in whom you also trusted
[1:09:28] after that you heard the word of truth
[1:09:31] the gospel of your salvation in whom
[1:09:35] also after that you believed
[1:09:37] now watch you were sealed with the Holy
[1:09:40] Spirit of promise he predestinated us
[1:09:44] unto the adoption of children you were
[1:09:46] sealed with that holy spirit of promise
[1:09:49] for 14 which is the earnest of our
[1:09:51] inheritance until the redemption of the
[1:09:54] purchased possession so there's still
[1:09:56] something more to come which is the
[1:09:58] change of our bodies but the finished
[1:10:01] work is that when we receive the Holy
[1:10:04] Ghost when we are sealed by the Holy
[1:10:06] Ghost we receive the Holy Spirit of
[1:10:08] promise which is an earnest or a
[1:10:11] guarantee and that's what I want to talk
[1:10:14] about this morning his word it's a
[1:10:15] guarantee because now he's died he's
[1:10:19] paid with his blood that's what makes us
[1:10:21] a Christian that's what changed our
[1:10:24] lives we were the seed of God but it
[1:10:27] took the blood of God to cover our sins
[1:10:30] divorce take away sin to be a profession
[1:10:34] it took the blood of God to do that but
[1:10:36] now you received the Holy Spirit of
[1:10:39] promise which is a guarantee to you that
[1:10:42] you know God already knew he already
[1:10:50] knew that you'd be here he already knew
[1:10:53] that you were a Christian he already
[1:10:55] knew that she'd be saved he already knew
[1:10:58] that you could be here you already knew
[1:11:00] but what is the Holy Ghost
[1:11:01] it is the earnest of our inheritance to
[1:11:02] let you know to let me know that I could
[1:11:07] be safe let me
[1:11:08] you know because I didn't think I could
[1:11:10] to let me know that I could be healed to
[1:11:12] let me know that those redemptive
[1:11:13] blessings those promises belong to me
[1:11:15] personally and so he says that it is the
[1:11:23] earnest of our inheritance until the
[1:11:25] redemption of the purchased possession
[1:11:27] now he references the earnest also Paul
[1:11:30] does in second Corinthians second
[1:11:32] Corinthians chapter 1 and verse 21 he
[1:11:35] said now he which establishes us with
[1:11:37] you in Christ and hath anointed us it is
[1:11:40] God who hath also sealed us and given
[1:11:44] the earnest of the Spirit in our hearts
[1:11:48] that's a guarantee
[1:11:51] second Corinthians five and five now he
[1:11:55] that hath brought us he said for the
[1:11:58] self same thing is God who also hath
[1:12:01] given unto us the earnest of the spirit
[1:12:05] the language in the New Testament is
[1:12:10] it's never used that you earned the Holy
[1:12:12] Spirit it's always that he gave it
[1:12:18] remember that you don't earn the Holy
[1:12:21] Ghost he gives it you just have to want
[1:12:24] it he said he wants to give it to you
[1:12:27] you just have to want it you have to be
[1:12:29] willing to accept that it's surrender to
[1:12:30] it now he's given us this earnest of the
[1:12:35] Spirit now but the Bible explains that
[1:12:37] word earnest enough in a way maybe that
[1:12:39] we'd understand better than if I
[1:12:40] explained it he said now he said I'm
[1:12:43] gonna give you the earnest of your
[1:12:44] salvation he said you know what the
[1:12:45] earnest is it's a downpayment he said
[1:12:48] like if I wanted to buy a boat from one
[1:12:50] of you Indian brethren went out and said
[1:12:51] how much you want for the boat you say
[1:12:53] two thousand dollars I'd say well I'll
[1:12:55] tell you what I'll do I'm gonna give you
[1:12:56] fifty dollars to hold it for me until
[1:12:58] next week he said will you do it hold it
[1:13:01] for me I'll do it brother Brown then
[1:13:03] you'd give me a receipt I'll give you
[1:13:05] fifty dollars
[1:13:06] no you can't sell that boat because I
[1:13:09] got first bid on it he said that's the
[1:13:12] earnest that I'm gonna get the boat it
[1:13:13] belongs to me well now God came back and
[1:13:16] said go up there to Jerusalem and wait
[1:13:18] I'm gonna send you the earnest of your
[1:13:20] salvation
[1:13:22] and they were all up there all in one
[1:13:24] Accord noticed in one place and suddenly
[1:13:27] there came the earnest come down from
[1:13:30] heaven like a rushing mighty wind it
[1:13:31] filled all the house where they were
[1:13:34] sitting so I want you to notice that the
[1:13:37] earnest guarantees four things four
[1:13:40] things the first being that's a chain of
[1:13:42] title is complete if you don't
[1:13:43] understand that that's just the list of
[1:13:45] deeds that go back to the original owner
[1:13:48] and is redeemed by Christ at the cross
[1:13:52] that chain of title it comes back in him
[1:13:56] and we inherit in him right so that
[1:14:00] chain of title is complete is also the
[1:14:04] guarantee that all liens have been
[1:14:06] extinguished everything's paid off they
[1:14:15] can't come back and say they have a
[1:14:16] claim on it anymore the sinners over
[1:14:19] that it's done you can't remind it you
[1:14:22] know people get in a contest sometimes
[1:14:24] and they begin to dislike one another
[1:14:26] and they begin to bring up things about
[1:14:27] each other's past and if they're
[1:14:29] Christians God doesn't remember any of
[1:14:30] it we can't fight each other based on
[1:14:36] what unrepentant sin because it's over
[1:14:38] it's done and that's for all of us but
[1:14:42] we have to repent a sly said repent and
[1:14:45] be baptized every one of you in the name
[1:14:46] of Jesus Christ for the remission of
[1:14:48] your sins you shall receive the gift of
[1:14:49] the Holy Ghost what is it it's a it's an
[1:14:52] earnest to come to you when for
[1:14:54] repentance comes and you're in godly
[1:14:57] sorrow you have for repentance of your
[1:14:58] sins then he comes and steals you with
[1:15:00] the Holy Ghost now repenting is turning
[1:15:03] around from what you were and you are
[1:15:05] willfully surrendering yourself to God
[1:15:09] something in you now you couldn't do
[1:15:11] that unless you get out of seat in you
[1:15:12] had to be something in you to be able to
[1:15:15] do that and some people fight that all
[1:15:17] of their lives but it's just you
[1:15:19] willfully laying your life down I am
[1:15:21] crucified with Christ everything yes I
[1:15:23] live but not me Christ lives in me
[1:15:26] so it's laying down who you are and
[1:15:29] letting the the liens be extinguished in
[1:15:33] your life allow
[1:15:35] him to clear the title repentance comes
[1:15:39] before the Holy Ghost
[1:15:42] now look number three is that your
[1:15:45] rights or his rights can be enforced in
[1:15:48] you once the titles been cleared there's
[1:15:52] a guarantee the chain of title goes all
[1:15:54] the way back the liens have been
[1:15:56] extinguished and rights can be enforced
[1:16:00] before I have the guarantee I might
[1:16:02] wonder I might think well what if
[1:16:05] there's something there and so I would
[1:16:07] be afraid to go to court and enforce my
[1:16:10] right to the title of the land but now
[1:16:13] I'm not afraid why the abstract came I
[1:16:18] got it in the mail I looked at I said
[1:16:21] hey it's mine I can trace it all the way
[1:16:24] back I didn't do it but I own it I
[1:16:27] didn't buy it but it's mine are you with
[1:16:32] me now I didn't buy it I didn't have
[1:16:35] anything do with it but here the
[1:16:37] abstract comes down I've repented of my
[1:16:39] sins here comes the abstract doubt in my
[1:16:41] life and it shows me it's a guarantee
[1:16:43] that I cannot go back I cannot go to
[1:16:46] hell Amen I can't die eternally if I go
[1:16:52] to sleep in this life always again and
[1:16:57] it's a guarantee that every right to
[1:17:01] redemptive blessings can be enforced
[1:17:03] whatever I own I can walk on it whatever
[1:17:08] I own
[1:17:09] whatever the land says the devil can't
[1:17:13] take it from me and you could take that
[1:17:18] however that it fits your life now it's
[1:17:21] also a guarantee that resurrection is
[1:17:23] assured and some of you all as you grow
[1:17:27] older and and I think all of us as we
[1:17:29] get closer to the end we need to realize
[1:17:31] this this is our guarantee no amount of
[1:17:35] knowledge guarantees you a resurrection
[1:17:38] no amount of going to church guarantees
[1:17:42] you a resurrection and nobody believes
[1:17:44] in going to church more than I do
[1:17:47] nobody believes you go to church more
[1:17:49] than I do I've been out on a Sunday out
[1:17:52] or not in church I'm gonna say this to
[1:17:53] brag but it's just the way I was raised
[1:17:55] I've been out of church maybe two or
[1:17:57] three times in my life on a Sunday and
[1:18:00] and during those times you makes you
[1:18:02] feel bad and I am just the way I was
[1:18:05] raised and I understand it doesn't save
[1:18:07] me though it has nothing to do with my
[1:18:09] resurrection but I want to do it to
[1:18:11] honor his resurrection but our
[1:18:15] resurrection is the shirt not by going
[1:18:17] to church not by being a good person but
[1:18:18] because of the seal ready bet it's
[1:18:23] guaranteed to us
[1:18:25] some of y'all get a chance to go back
[1:18:27] and listen to that sermon the brother
[1:18:28] Andrew preached it at Living Word
[1:18:30] Tabernacle yesterday and he talked about
[1:18:31] how it seals in and it seals out not
[1:18:35] only seals you in but it seals the devil
[1:18:37] out I look and so and these things I had
[1:18:42] before that I had studied early so we
[1:18:44] could go to the meeting but I'm just so
[1:18:46] I was just so blessed by it and so our
[1:18:48] resurrection is a shirt but the Bible
[1:18:51] says it this way the resurrection is
[1:18:52] sure hey babe it's a guarantee and we
[1:18:58] have the earnest of it now as the Holy
[1:19:02] Spirit comes in and identifies us as
[1:19:06] God's redeemed person sister Vicky you
[1:19:11] can say I'm God's redeemed person I've
[1:19:17] been identified God put his stamp on me
[1:19:20] put a seal on me as tag on me I belong
[1:19:25] to him the scripture and the Bible talks
[1:19:29] about when when I gather my jewels and
[1:19:31] the idea there is is of God going
[1:19:34] through and I think I've spoken about it
[1:19:35] to you before but it's God going through
[1:19:37] all the jewels and picking out the ones
[1:19:39] that are his and putting them in his own
[1:19:42] corner in his own box in his own pile
[1:19:44] saying these are mine he identifies
[1:19:47] those that are his by the Holy Ghost hey
[1:19:51] Ben aren't you glad you can be
[1:19:53] identified in the earnest of your
[1:19:54] inheritance you don't have to worry you
[1:19:57] don't have to be afraid wonder am I
[1:19:59] going to go to heaven is
[1:20:00] gonna be a Resurrectionist I'm getting
[1:20:01] older is there going to be a
[1:20:03] resurrection if I if I go by way of the
[1:20:05] grave am I gonna make it the
[1:20:06] resurrection is sure it's a guarantee
[1:20:08] because we have the earnest of it now as
[1:20:12] the Holy Spirit comes in and identifies
[1:20:14] us as God's redeemed person he said when
[1:20:17] you receive the Holy Ghost you're sealed
[1:20:19] till the journey is over hallelujah
[1:20:24] you're sealed till the journey is over
[1:20:27] but the brand uses the analogy of a
[1:20:28] train which it's hard for us to
[1:20:30] understand because many of us know
[1:20:31] anything to do with trains now but some
[1:20:33] of the older folk man understand better
[1:20:34] but a train would be sealed a boxcar
[1:20:37] would be sealed up to its destination no
[1:20:41] one had a right to break that feel and
[1:20:43] your soul has been sealed you didn't
[1:20:46] seal your body filled your soul your
[1:20:49] soul has been sealed to your destination
[1:20:52] aren't you happy about it today if I'm
[1:20:57] guaranteed you know some of you have
[1:21:00] more faith in Amazon you do in God
[1:21:05] Amazon has a two day guarantee if you've
[1:21:09] got Prime I think it is got a two day
[1:21:11] guarantee
[1:21:12] some of y'all shop on Amazon I know you
[1:21:14] do got a two day guarantee sometimes
[1:21:17] that don't arrive in time does it better
[1:21:19] Joe sometimes the Amazon package doesn't
[1:21:22] get there when it's supposed to but
[1:21:24] there's a there's a guarantee and and
[1:21:27] you feel like you have an assurance
[1:21:28] that's going to happen and if it doesn't
[1:21:30] happen I found myself during the height
[1:21:32] of the coronavirus thing when there was
[1:21:33] all kinds of pressures going on I was
[1:21:36] impatient with Amazon because anything
[1:21:39] we ordered we didn't go out to Walmart
[1:21:41] so much we ordered it off Amazon like
[1:21:43] some of you probably did and so you
[1:21:45] order off of there and get it shipped to
[1:21:47] your home and if it didn't show up in
[1:21:48] two days because of the shipping delays
[1:21:50] that were going on and problems with the
[1:21:52] supply chain it kind of makes you a
[1:21:53] little angry I'll just be honest you you
[1:21:58] you had a guarantee two days it's
[1:22:02] supposed to be there and then they set
[1:22:04] it on your porch and if somebody feels
[1:22:06] you you get mad but it just sit there
[1:22:11] all day you know
[1:22:13] but look and then you do the chores you
[1:22:17] have a right to it you paid for it but
[1:22:20] how much more should we be assured that
[1:22:23] the delivery that the package of our
[1:22:26] soul that was sealed by the Holy Ghost
[1:22:29] will be delivered to its destination all
[1:22:34] of you if you traveled you probably lost
[1:22:36] luggage
[1:22:37] I've lost luggage I saw cartooning the
[1:22:39] other day that had a this irate customer
[1:22:42] that was was telling the airline what to
[1:22:45] do and where to go it and they're just
[1:22:46] acting up and here the the lady he
[1:22:49] doesn't know it behind the counter
[1:22:50] there's a button that says send the bags
[1:22:52] to Timbuktu and so as this customer is
[1:22:57] just being irate and the lady just
[1:22:59] pushes the button and the bags go to
[1:23:03] Timbuktu and that's why baggage gets
[1:23:04] lost a bit and we know that's not right
[1:23:06] why does it get lost because even the
[1:23:07] best supply chains don't always work
[1:23:10] even the best made plans fail and so
[1:23:16] you've experienced that and we get used
[1:23:17] to instant gratification but sometimes
[1:23:19] even the most guaranteed thing in life
[1:23:21] will fail we found that out recently
[1:23:26] that sometimes we can't guarantee
[1:23:27] anything but we can guarantee this that
[1:23:31] if he sealed you hey bet it doesn't
[1:23:36] matter if your mind goes it doesn't
[1:23:40] matter if you lose everything it doesn't
[1:23:44] matter
[1:23:44] Church it doesn't matter if you make a
[1:23:47] mistake it doesn't matter what happens
[1:23:49] God sealed you until the day of your
[1:23:51] redemption and he put a desire in you he
[1:23:55] knew you would overcome it's not that he
[1:23:58] he just pushes you through life or makes
[1:24:00] you overcome but he put something in you
[1:24:02] that's an overcomer he put something in
[1:24:05] you that there would be trials there
[1:24:06] would be struggles there would be thanks
[1:24:08] but he created you in such a way and he
[1:24:10] may cause you to come in such a way and
[1:24:12] he put his seal in you so that his
[1:24:14] spirit could overcome in you you are an
[1:24:17] overcomer
[1:24:17] we already when you're sealed by the
[1:24:19] Holy Ghost you don't have to worry you
[1:24:21] don't have to worry sit well if we do
[1:24:23] the wrong
[1:24:23] thing we make a mistake we're gonna
[1:24:25] we're not gonna make it the package it's
[1:24:27] gonna reach its destination that package
[1:24:29] won't be open until it gets in this
[1:24:31] presence hey babe we can be assured
[1:24:35] there won't be nobody else there won't
[1:24:36] be no preachers hands on there won't be
[1:24:38] no people's hands on it but it'll be
[1:24:40] sealed until the day of our redemption
[1:24:45] are you with me now if you were sealed
[1:24:49] 60 years ago it still holds to its final
[1:24:54] destination 40 years ago it still holds
[1:24:56] yesterday it still holds to guarantee
[1:25:02] you've sealed till the journey is over
[1:25:05] that is your token that you hold it
[1:25:09] shows that your fare has been paid Hey
[1:25:13] you see he leaves his name on it and
[1:25:16] makes you a joint heir so you can't mess

[1:25:29] your token that you hold that shows that

[1:25:42] token your ticket show him my healing is
[1:25:45] paid for my trip to glory Hey
[1:25:49] it's paid for amen and then we find that
[1:25:55] the manifestation of the word in our
[1:25:58] midst is a guarantee that his promises
[1:26:02] are true we have a guarantee people look
[1:26:06] at the message of something well it
[1:26:07] could be true and it could not be no
[1:26:08] it's a guarantee it's the fulfillment of
[1:26:11] prophecy God came down put his foot on
[1:26:17] the land of the sea we believe that
[1:26:21] there's an open book it's a fulfillment
[1:26:22] of prophecy Christ came down in our
[1:26:27] generation and there was the son of man
[1:26:29] ministry to all these things we look at
[1:26:30] even the discernment all those things
[1:26:32] was gone
[1:26:33] fulfilling his word yes William Branham
[1:26:35] was a man
[1:26:36] yes he made mistakes but God was
[1:26:38] fulfilling his word and it's a
[1:26:41] guaranteed us that Jesus Christ was the
[1:26:43] same yesterday today and forever but we
[1:26:46] take it even farther because you could
[1:26:48] look at that and say well that happened
[1:26:49] years ago but look at it today his
[1:26:51] manifestation in her midst today is a
[1:26:54] guarantee to us that he's still alive
[1:26:58] the fact that he sealed you the fact
[1:27:01] that he healed you the fact that he
[1:27:03] saved you the fact that he brought you
[1:27:05] to this place is a guarantee you he's
[1:27:08] been better to you than you've been to
[1:27:10] him he's been better to me than I've
[1:27:14] been to him you're sealed he said that
[1:27:21] is your token that you hold the shows
[1:27:23] that your fare has been paid I love the
[1:27:25] way he puts this you are a redeemed
[1:27:27] character he bet and somebody said well
[1:27:32] you're just a character that's true but
[1:27:34] I'm a redeemed character I may not do
[1:27:38] things like every other character but
[1:27:39] I'm a redeemed character and I have a
[1:27:42] redeemed character you're redeemed
[1:27:44] character Satan has no business with you
[1:27:48] I remember no business no business if
[1:27:56] he's on the door it's not your business
[1:27:59] be knocking not yours
[1:28:02] he delivers a package nope I got my
[1:28:05] sealed package not yours not mine I have
[1:28:10] no business for Satan I don't want
[1:28:12] anything to do with him that's what Paul
[1:28:14] said I keep under my body bring it under
[1:28:16] subjection listen having preached to
[1:28:18] others i myself would be disapproved
[1:28:20] because I don't want anything to cause
[1:28:23] Satan to have an involvement in my life
[1:28:26] are you with me now Satan has no
[1:28:29] business with you none whatever just
[1:28:32] pick up your token and show him my
[1:28:34] healing is paid for hey man my trip to
[1:28:38] glory is paid for now I want to take a
[1:28:43] closer look at the day that the abstract
[1:28:47] came back you
[1:28:50] they were all in anticipation and they
[1:28:51] were told in Luke 24:49 he said behold I
[1:28:54] send the promise of my father upon you
[1:28:56] but tarry in the city of Jerusalem until
[1:28:59] you be endued with power from on high
[1:29:01] so they were waiting for something to
[1:29:03] happen they had to wait for that time
[1:29:08] now brother Ram teaches us in the
[1:29:10] message we don't tarry for the Holy
[1:29:11] Ghost because the Holy Ghost is already
[1:29:14] here
[1:29:15] we don't tarry for it because it's
[1:29:18] already here but they waited for it what
[1:29:20] were they waiting on titled to be
[1:29:22] cleared although that work to be
[1:29:26] finished to be completed and now here
[1:29:28] they were on the day of Pentecost 50
[1:29:30] days later they're waiting they go down
[1:29:33] there and wait until the day of
[1:29:35] Pentecost in and they wait there for 10
[1:29:37] days and they were tearing waiting on
[1:29:40] the return of the abstract the price has
[1:29:43] been paid the the land has been conveyed
[1:29:48] it's already done finished but they
[1:29:53] still had to wait what were they waiting
[1:29:55] on the personal guarantee each one of
[1:29:59] them would receive a personal guarantee
[1:30:01] that the land not only belonged to
[1:30:04] Christ but that it belonged to them that
[1:30:09] the work was effective and we can't
[1:30:13] under sell the importance of the token
[1:30:15] or oversell the importance of the token
[1:30:17] we have to make sure that we understand
[1:30:19] how important this is because without it
[1:30:22] we have no guarantees with it we are
[1:30:25] completely assured of a guarantee now
[1:30:29] this was God's appointed time that the
[1:30:32] token would come I want to tell you
[1:30:35] today that the day of the token is here
[1:30:38] brother band said that in the feast of
[1:30:40] the trumpets or he talks about and I
[1:30:43] want to go through this kind of back up
[1:30:44] a little bit he talks about how that the
[1:30:46] Holy Ghost was bound but it had to be
[1:30:49] loosed and I think this is important
[1:30:53] because a lot of people misunderstand
[1:30:54] and think that while we're waiting on
[1:30:56] something we're not waiting on a return
[1:31:00] of the abstract they waited we don't
[1:31:03] have to
[1:31:04] we're here and we're not waiting on
[1:31:08] those things to be restored back to us
[1:31:10] they're here the message is here
[1:31:14] everything we have need of is here well
[1:31:17] then if we're waiting it's a personal
[1:31:19] thing we need to be assured ourselves of
[1:31:22] the Holy Ghost we need to be sure but we
[1:31:25] don't have to wait on God to do that we
[1:31:28] don't have to wait on God to have
[1:31:30] revival in our hearts we don't have to
[1:31:32] wait on something for there to be a
[1:31:34] church that's on fire for God we can
[1:31:38] have that now we got to wait on somebody
[1:31:42] to come by some man to come by so we can
[1:31:44] be healed we can have it today as the
[1:31:48] scripture says today is the day of
[1:31:49] salvation before the round talks about
[1:31:50] those demons that were bound with
[1:31:52] Euphrates River he said while this group
[1:31:54] down here has got 2,000 he said bound at
[1:31:58] the river Euphrates and has been bound
[1:32:01] for 2,000 years I think was 200,000
[1:32:04] thousand or something like that and said
[1:32:06] it's been bound for 2,000 years also he
[1:32:08] said that church has bound the Holy
[1:32:10] Ghost for nearly 2,000 years under
[1:32:14] martyred him back there and under the
[1:32:16] church edges has been bound not at the
[1:32:18] river Euphrates but at the door of
[1:32:20] Creed's and dogmas that the Holy Spirit
[1:32:22] can't work in the church because a
[1:32:24] man-made systems but she is going to be
[1:32:27] liberated she is coming back that's what
[1:32:30] the Bible said now I would ask you today
[1:32:33] is it still bound it can't be bound
[1:32:38] today or God sinning Malachi's for
[1:32:42] revelations in 7 was ineffective and
[1:32:46] that's where you go back to what I
[1:32:47] preached here how long ago he said well
[1:32:49] I find faith when I return and brother
[1:32:51] mentor said that was will Malachi 4 be
[1:32:53] fulfilled will revelation 10 seven Luke
[1:32:56] 17 30 be fulfilled we can look back on
[1:32:59] and say it has been fulfilled so he said
[1:33:03] she's coming back that's what the Bible
[1:33:04] said the third seal were the remnants of
[1:33:05] the bride hasn't had a revival yet see
[1:33:08] there's been no revival there no
[1:33:09] manifestation of God to stir the bride
[1:33:10] yet see we're looking for it now it'll
[1:33:13] take those seven unknown thunders back
[1:33:15] there to wake her up again
[1:33:16] wake her up notice the language Jesus
[1:33:18] wake her up see ya he'll send it he
[1:33:20] promised it and the people after that
[1:33:23] day we're looking for a great revival
[1:33:24] many of them still are now you find a
[1:33:28] generation that's raised up that don't
[1:33:30] even think they need revival in fact
[1:33:33] you'll find the melodic aromatics
[1:33:36] believe there's been a Great Awakening
[1:33:37] what they have now is a great revival I
[1:33:42] think it brings a bad name on revival
[1:33:46] because you look at any revival that
[1:33:49] ever happened any Great Awakening in
[1:33:50] this nation or any other nation when it
[1:33:52] happened it changed places they say that
[1:33:55] when the message of Wesley would reach a
[1:33:57] city that every the bar rooms would
[1:33:59] close and the city would clean up and
[1:34:03] the prostitutes everything else would be
[1:34:05] gone why because the message reached
[1:34:07] that city it was an awakening and we
[1:34:12] find that there hasn't been a Great
[1:34:13] Awakening like that and in this stay and
[1:34:15] but there was an awakening now look he
[1:34:19] said there hadn't been a bride revival
[1:34:20] but we're looking for it now but then he
[1:34:21] says in recognizing your day and his
[1:34:23] message he talks about I don't have time
[1:34:25] to read it all but he talks about how
[1:34:26] that brother more and then we're
[1:34:28] crawling out we need a prophet to return
[1:34:30] and he says why did they do that why did
[1:34:33] they do that they want a Great Awakening
[1:34:35] they're crying believing that there will
[1:34:37] be awakening they're good people
[1:34:39] why is it what have they done they've
[1:34:41] not recognized the awakening of the
[1:34:43] bride what about us have we recognized
[1:34:47] the awakening of the bride because if we
[1:34:50] recognize that we'd wake up
[1:34:51] I believe we're awake today but look if
[1:34:56] you're sleeping if you find yourself
[1:34:58] back slit if you fight it's not God's
[1:35:01] fault it's not to follow the message
[1:35:03] it's on me it's on you we find herself
[1:35:07] in a dry time we just need to get to the
[1:35:10] water the waters available hey Ben we
[1:35:13] find her just waiting like they did at
[1:35:15] the at the pool of a sinner they were
[1:35:17] waiting for the moving of the water not
[1:35:19] realizing that denominational pool would
[1:35:21] never be stirred again but Jesus come
[1:35:24] walking through there to the elected and
[1:35:26] said will you be whole do you want to be
[1:35:28] well
[1:35:28] amen and I believe he's done the same
[1:35:30] thing with the message of the hour today
[1:35:32] that he comes and wade through all the
[1:35:34] sea of people and he comes to your house
[1:35:36] and he comes to your house and he says
[1:35:38] do you want to be well you want to be
[1:35:42] well and something in you says yes take
[1:35:44] up your bed and walk
[1:35:45] hey Ben you don't have to be bound
[1:35:48] anymore why because there's been an
[1:35:50] awakening of the bride hallelujah
[1:35:54] they've not recognized the awakening of
[1:35:56] the bride by being a Christian they feel
[1:35:58] the pole of the hour but they haven't
[1:36:00] recognized what's been done that's
[1:36:02] what's making them feel that way they
[1:36:04] know something is supposed to happen but
[1:36:06] see they're looking for it way off in
[1:36:08] the future to come when it's already
[1:36:10] happened right by you he said that's the
[1:36:15] same thing they did in the old days they
[1:36:17] was believing in the coming Messiah they
[1:36:19] believed that there would be a
[1:36:20] forerunner come but it was right on them
[1:36:22] and they didn't know it they didn't
[1:36:25] recognize it
[1:36:26] Oh church we got to recognize our day of
[1:36:29] visitation if God is moving in our mist
[1:36:32] if God is doing something we've got to
[1:36:34] be willing to let him do it
[1:36:36] let him do it let him move let him come
[1:36:39] in let him just sweep over your heart
[1:36:41] don't let prejudices or pride or some
[1:36:44] kind of indifference in your life some
[1:36:46] kind of malaise in your life caused you
[1:36:48] to miss the movement of God but if God
[1:36:51] is moving however simple it may seem it
[1:36:54] may be just the presence that we feel
[1:36:55] and maybe just we recognize God is
[1:36:58] there's an awakened gulf doing something
[1:36:59] let's move with it let's be a part of it
[1:37:02] let's recognize the awakening of the
[1:37:04] bride because the awakening is already
[1:37:07] here so right on them they didn't know
[1:37:09] what they didn't recognize it this as I
[1:37:12] said it's a token time but the bread and
[1:37:15] said the lamb was killed in the evening
[1:37:16] time after being kept up for 14 days are
[1:37:19] you still with me this morning he said
[1:37:22] then the lamb was killed and the blood
[1:37:23] was applied in the evening time said you
[1:37:25] get as the token never come into
[1:37:26] existence until the evening time I'll be
[1:37:29] honest with you I struggled with that
[1:37:30] with that quote for years and finally
[1:37:33] come to understand what he was talking
[1:37:35] about but I struggled with it because
[1:37:37] her abstract came back on the day of
[1:37:39] Pentecost but he said the token never
[1:37:41] come into
[1:37:41] existence until the evening time and
[1:37:43] this is the evening time of the age that
[1:37:45] we live in is that this is the evening
[1:37:48] time for the church this is the evening
[1:37:50] time for me he said this is the evening
[1:37:53] time of my message I'm dying I'm going
[1:37:55] he was only in his 50s but he recognized
[1:37:59] it he said this is the evening time for
[1:38:00] me this is evening to have our message
[1:38:02] I'm dying I'm going I'm moving out in
[1:38:04] the evening time of the gospel and we've
[1:38:06] come up through justification and so
[1:38:07] forth but this is the time that the
[1:38:09] token has to be applied are you hearing
[1:38:12] me this morning this is the guarantee
[1:38:15] that all that we've been talking about
[1:38:17] is true this is how we enforce our
[1:38:20] rights apply the token he said I told
[1:38:25] you lie Sunday I had something I wanted
[1:38:26] to talk to you about this is it the time
[1:38:29] when you can't just can't play with it
[1:38:31] and if you go back to that sermon I
[1:38:34] spent I don't know how many maybe 50
[1:38:36] sermons on it talking about the token
[1:38:38] how that and going through that that
[1:38:40] sermon word by word with the church it
[1:38:42] and brother IVs and we went through it
[1:38:43] and as we went through it I began to
[1:38:45] realize this was urgent too brother
[1:38:47] Branham this was urgent he was seeing
[1:38:49] something in his own church that they
[1:38:51] just weren't catching it like they
[1:38:52] should they weren't catching this the
[1:38:54] token has to be applied he said I told
[1:38:57] you last Sunday had something I wanted
[1:38:58] to talk to you about the time when you
[1:39:00] just can't play with it it's got to be
[1:39:02] done if it's ever going to be done it's
[1:39:04] got to be done now because we can see
[1:39:07] that the Raps is about ready to pass
[1:39:09] through the land and everything from
[1:39:11] under that token will perish look what's
[1:39:16] happened just over the last few days
[1:39:19] over the last few months we can see that
[1:39:23] the wrath is about ready to pass through
[1:39:25] the land as I said Wednesday night God
[1:39:27] has a cup a cup full of the wrath of his
[1:39:30] indignation a cup and that cup he said
[1:39:33] the wicked will drink the dregs of it
[1:39:37] it'll be that foul-tasting strongest
[1:39:41] part of the cup will be what the wicked
[1:39:44] will drink it's coming it may not look
[1:39:48] like it now but it's coming and we see
[1:39:50] the signs of it all around us if it's
[1:39:53] ever going to be done if we're ever
[1:39:54] gonna get
[1:39:55] serious with God if we're ever gonna get
[1:39:56] down to business with God it's now now
[1:39:59] it's not the time to give up on church
[1:40:01] now it's not the time to give up on go
[1:40:03] to the house of God now it's not the
[1:40:04] time to give up on worshipping God now
[1:40:07] it's not the time to give up after we've
[1:40:09] been through the coronavirus say well it
[1:40:10] doesn't matter anymore
[1:40:11] it does matter now's not the time to get
[1:40:14] up on us to give up while assembling
[1:40:15] together now it's not the time to give
[1:40:17] up on the preaching of the word now it's
[1:40:18] the time to stand up and be the bride
[1:40:22] that we're supposed to be now it's token
[1:40:24] time now it's the time that we stand up
[1:40:26] and say if it's ever gonna be done it's
[1:40:28] got to be done now Shamgar got so weak
[1:40:32] that he that he thought he just couldn't
[1:40:35] make it anymore he looked this little
[1:40:36] family so weak he said if it's ever
[1:40:38] gonna be done it's gonna be done now hey
[1:40:42] man he picked up a dog's coat said now
[1:40:43] is the time to do it now's the time to
[1:40:45] change my life now's the time to
[1:40:47] rededicate things now it's the time to
[1:40:49] take advantage of the blood lambs been
[1:40:53] provided there's been there's a blood
[1:40:55] ready there's there's food there for you
[1:40:57] to eat in your homes
[1:40:58] Oh a lamb a blood was placed on Rose a
[1:41:03] lamb there was blood there but they had
[1:41:05] to apply it they had to eat the lamb to
[1:41:08] have strength for the journey it's ever
[1:41:12] going to be done it's got to be done now
[1:41:14] because we can see that the wrath is
[1:41:16] about ready to pass through the land and
[1:41:19] everything from under that token will
[1:41:21] perish I want you to notice also before
[1:41:24] we close the attitude of the believers
[1:41:28] toward one another at this time when the
[1:41:33] token came when the we say it this way
[1:41:37] the abstract returned they got the
[1:41:40] guarantee says they were all with one
[1:41:43] Accord in one place he said brother Ben
[1:41:47] when you go to quit preaching about this
[1:41:49] when we're all in one Accord in one
[1:41:51] place and I'm preaching it myself too
[1:41:59] but they were able to put aside their
[1:42:01] differences than they had differences
[1:42:04] enough to come together and say we need
[1:42:08] something we need to come together to
[1:42:11] create an atmosphere so that we can have
[1:42:14] what we need
[1:42:15] they were all in one Accord in one place
[1:42:19] I'm gonna preempt Peter back there I
[1:42:22] know that he's thinking that's a Honda
[1:42:24] Accord and it's not I was gonna hear
[1:42:27] that joke on the way home I know that's
[1:42:29] true
[1:42:31] but it's one Accord now what does that
[1:42:35] mean the definition of that and also the
[1:42:38] word in acts 1:14 which says though
[1:42:40] these all continued with one Accord in
[1:42:42] prayer and in supplication with women
[1:42:44] and Mary the mother of Jesus with his
[1:42:46] brethren they were all there the hundred
[1:42:47] and twenty it means with one mind with
[1:42:51] one Accord with one passion one passion
[1:42:58] have you ever been to a car show where
[1:43:01] they have these beautiful antique cars
[1:43:03] show cars you know those people don't
[1:43:06] have much in common although there's a
[1:43:09] bunch of rednecks usually at those
[1:43:10] places but there's rich people poor
[1:43:13] people
[1:43:14] there's middle-aged people old people
[1:43:17] young people and they're all there and
[1:43:20] and they all come together and iron out
[1:43:25] their differences and choose a winner
[1:43:26] among themselves which might be hard to
[1:43:30] do because each one thinks they want
[1:43:31] each one thinks they have the best but
[1:43:34] they all come together because they
[1:43:35] value something they have a passion for
[1:43:38] something they have a passion so they
[1:43:41] are come in one place so that they can
[1:43:43] share that passion so that they can they
[1:43:45] can come together and share the passion
[1:43:47] that they have how much more should
[1:43:50] believers be able to come together and
[1:43:53] put aside petty differences enough to
[1:43:56] fit together in the presence and in the
[1:43:59] coolness of the of the Tree of Life
[1:44:01] under the under the leaves that have
[1:44:03] been provided for the healing of the
[1:44:05] nations and the fellowship of the
[1:44:07] brother how much more should we be able
[1:44:09] to come together and sit down under the
[1:44:11] Tree of Life and say brother I have the
[1:44:14] same need that you do I have the same
[1:44:15] passion that you do I want to see my
[1:44:17] kids safe I want to see them receive the
[1:44:20] token I want to
[1:44:21] I want to see the law streets I wouldn't
[1:44:23] see the coming of the Lord so we have a
[1:44:27] passion that's alike
[1:44:28] you're from different places you come
[1:44:31] and drive for miles
[1:44:32] some of you from down in Arkansas and
[1:44:34] some from up in Missouri drive an hour
[1:44:38] or more to come to church I know what
[1:44:40] that feels like right now but you do it
[1:44:45] and you've done it maybe four years why
[1:44:47] there's a passion there's a passion in
[1:44:52] you something you want to keep the word
[1:44:54] alive in your heart so you come to
[1:44:57] church even if everything's it's not
[1:44:58] like you think it ought to be one may
[1:45:00] feel like the music should be this way
[1:45:01] one may feel like it should be this way
[1:45:03] one may feel like the preacher should be
[1:45:04] like this or one may feel like you
[1:45:05] should be like this but the passion is
[1:45:07] the same the passion comes and it pulls
[1:45:12] us together I have a passion to see
[1:45:15] don't you see that's what the Ephesus
[1:45:16] church lost when they drifted away
[1:45:18] they lost their passion for Holy Ghost
[1:45:20] meetings they lost their passion for the
[1:45:22] word they lost their love for God cooled
[1:45:25] off here that their love was was firm
[1:45:29] they were with one mind with one Accord
[1:45:30] with one passion don't you see that's
[1:45:35] what keeps you together it has a married
[1:45:38] couple and the passion that you have in
[1:45:43] a marriage than the natural passion will
[1:45:46] ebb and flow it will it'll come and go
[1:45:50] there'll be times you don't even want to
[1:45:52] see one another why do you stay together
[1:45:55] not just because of the heartbeat that's
[1:45:58] uttered the first time you saw her
[1:46:00] not because just you liked the way he
[1:46:02] smelled when you met him not because
[1:46:05] they were so handsome because what keeps
[1:46:07] the passion alive then in an old couple
[1:46:11] the Curtis have been married a long time
[1:46:13] some of the rest you've been married a
[1:46:14] long time what keeps the passion alive
[1:46:18] what keeps the passion what is the
[1:46:22] passion the passion is not the
[1:46:25] attraction the passion is your desire
[1:46:28] for one another not for the body but for
[1:46:32] the person
[1:46:34] you were meant to be together and you
[1:46:37] wanted to create something with this
[1:46:39] person it would be cold to home and you
[1:46:41] wanted to stay together for the rest of
[1:46:42] your life why that's a passion and many
[1:46:46] times we look at the other passion and
[1:46:47] say well that's gone what am I gonna do
[1:46:49] no there's got to be a passion for more
[1:46:51] than that and it comes down to the
[1:46:53] Christian has to have a passion for
[1:46:55] their husband or their wife that'll
[1:46:56] actually reach on out into eternity I
[1:46:58] have a passion that my wife and I will
[1:47:00] be there one day I have a passion for my
[1:47:03] children that they'll be there one day
[1:47:05] goes beyond natural feeling but there's
[1:47:07] a passion that I have to see us be
[1:47:10] together on that day a passion that we
[1:47:14] have with one Accord with one passion as
[1:47:17] a church a passion we have to see that
[1:47:20] God move in our midst but the banner
[1:47:23] said it as the days go closer and closer
[1:47:25] and the narrowing of the path we want to
[1:47:28] go closer together you see in this age
[1:47:31] of social distancing we've even had to
[1:47:33] separate people in the pews and
[1:47:34] different things but he said we want to
[1:47:36] go closer together we want to get closer
[1:47:38] together my said we must be just one one
[1:47:43] body we must move together move together
[1:47:47] forgetting one another sins and our
[1:47:50] differences and just sticking closer and
[1:47:53] closer and closer as we see that day
[1:47:55] approaching assembling ourselves
[1:47:58] together all with one Accord and one
[1:48:00] heart where do people get their brother
[1:48:03] branham didn't believe in church we see
[1:48:06] the Day approaching
[1:48:07] it's a days grow closer and closer we
[1:48:09] assemble ourselves together with one
[1:48:11] Accord in one heart and if a brother or
[1:48:14] sister gets out of the way in any way
[1:48:15] don't do nothing but pray for that
[1:48:17] person and in love always considering
[1:48:19] one another don't never let one of you
[1:48:22] get away hear me Church no never let one
[1:48:25] of you get away well they were
[1:48:26] insignificant they didn't mean anything
[1:48:28] no never let one of you get away that's
[1:48:31] incumbent on all of us not just on the
[1:48:33] preacher don't ever let one of us get
[1:48:35] away if we can help we do everything we
[1:48:38] can like Abraham to go after our lost
[1:48:40] brother don't never let one of you get
[1:48:43] away stay together if you can
[1:48:45] our lost sister if you
[1:48:46] and add more to it constantly all the
[1:48:48] time it's a mandate we have in this hour
[1:48:52] stay together
[1:48:54] and if you can I'd like to write the
[1:48:56] words on little on the wall stay
[1:48:59] together and if you can't add more to it
[1:49:01] constantly all the time Philippians 2 1
[1:49:06] if there be therefore any consolation in
[1:49:09] Christ if any comfort of love if any
[1:49:11] fellowship of the Spirit if any bowels
[1:49:13] or heart and mercies fulfil you my joy
[1:49:16] that you be like-minded having the same
[1:49:18] love being of one Accord of one mind
[1:49:23] that nothing be done through strife or
[1:49:26] vainglory but in lowliness of mind let
[1:49:28] each esteem other better than themselves
[1:49:31] look not every man on his own things but
[1:49:34] every man also on the things of others
[1:49:38] they tell me that the Romans had a
[1:49:41] Romans or the Greeks wanted I don't
[1:49:43] remember which but they had a formation
[1:49:44] called the turtle and in that formation
[1:49:47] they would put their shield up but they
[1:49:50] wouldn't put it up in front of
[1:49:51] themselves they would put it up in front
[1:49:54] of their brother so that each man or
[1:49:57] their fellow their fellow warrior each
[1:50:01] man was responsible for his fellow so
[1:50:06] that each sheetal was in front of the
[1:50:08] net so you had to hope you had to you
[1:50:10] had to have the best wishes for the one
[1:50:12] standing beside you because the shield
[1:50:14] was him and that shield could move like
[1:50:16] a turtle with protection above and on
[1:50:19] each side but see there's one standing
[1:50:21] maybe towards the middle he's got his
[1:50:22] shield up here to protect from arrows
[1:50:25] from above he's got to rely on these
[1:50:28] people around him huh you realize that's
[1:50:31] what a preacher does a preacher stands
[1:50:33] and protects against this and he relies
[1:50:36] on deacons and trustees and housewives
[1:50:38] and people to stand around it people to
[1:50:42] stand around in and hold their shields
[1:50:44] up and if my brother gets hurt I don't
[1:50:46] want to leave his his place void I want
[1:50:48] to see that place filled
[1:50:54] brother branham speaking of that light
[1:50:58] that come in 1933 on the river he said
[1:51:02] do you know what brought these things to
[1:51:03] pass he's it was because brother Branham
[1:51:08] was who he was yes but he said this is
[1:51:10] what brought it to pass he said when I
[1:51:14] first started and the Lord appeared to
[1:51:16] me down on the river and told me that
[1:51:17] and but the veil saw that he said I
[1:51:19] believe in a paper in Canada many years
[1:51:21] ago where the angel of the Lord appeared
[1:51:23] on the river down there was on
[1:51:24] Associated Press mr. glide over local
[1:51:26] minister while baptizing he's sitting
[1:51:28] you know what did that
[1:51:30] when we had the tent meeting just across
[1:51:32] the street
[1:51:33] I listened he said this is what did that
[1:51:36] when we had the tent meeting just across
[1:51:38] the street a tent that seated about
[1:51:41] 2,500 people ministers come from
[1:51:44] everywhere and said brother come here
[1:51:46] minute I was just a boy just a kid he
[1:51:49] said how do you keep those people in one
[1:51:52] Accord they love one another
[1:51:55] till I haven't seen people love one
[1:51:57] another he said that's the Lord that's
[1:52:01] what this church was established upon
[1:52:03] that godly brotherly love for one
[1:52:05] another he said I seen them even shake
[1:52:08] hands with one another my they were
[1:52:11] brave
[1:52:14] he said I've seen them shake hands with
[1:52:16] one another I'll shake your hand from
[1:52:17] here right now after preaches I may not
[1:52:21] want to see you have to church oh he
[1:52:26] said that I see that I've seen them
[1:52:27] shake hands with one another leaving the
[1:52:29] place and cry like babies
[1:52:31] to leave one another they loved one
[1:52:34] another that well and I could go to
[1:52:37] their house to visit them at times he
[1:52:39] said the Bible is saying open why did
[1:52:41] they have the love because they were
[1:52:42] dedicated at home huh I could go to
[1:52:46] their house to visit them and times the
[1:52:48] Bible was saying open it staying with
[1:52:49] tears coming at night time where fathers
[1:52:52] and mothers are gathered together and
[1:52:53] their little children around on the
[1:52:54] floor kneeling around and fathers and
[1:52:56] mothers on their knees crying and
[1:52:57] praying I'd stand at the door and wait
[1:52:59] and wait and wait they even stopped
[1:53:01] praying I'll just sit down on the steps
[1:53:03] and start praying myself waiting for
[1:53:04] them he said they loved one another they
[1:53:07] loved one another we used to stand
[1:53:08] sing that old song blessed be the tie
[1:53:10] that binds our hearts in Christian love
[1:53:11] the fellowship of kindred - like - that
[1:53:13] above when we asunder party gives us
[1:53:16] inward pain but we shall still be joined
[1:53:18] in heart and I hope to meet again he
[1:53:21] said I say this was great joy in my
[1:53:23] heart to Christ many of them are
[1:53:24] sleeping around in these grave smart
[1:53:26] tonight waiting for that great
[1:53:28] resurrection that guaranteed
[1:53:31] resurrection there'll be some that I
[1:53:35] pastored years ago that I'll see and I
[1:53:36] won't recognize them maybe but they'll
[1:53:39] have to tell me who they are
[1:53:40] because when I know him they were
[1:53:42] nine-year they were a hundred but they
[1:53:43] went on to be with the Lord but they
[1:53:45] have a guarantee they'll raise again
[1:53:47] many they were sleeping around these
[1:53:49] graves bark tonight
[1:53:50] he said waiting for that great
[1:53:52] resurrection where we'll meet together
[1:53:53] again he said that not that spirit ever
[1:53:56] depart from this place listen to me that
[1:54:02] not that spirit ever depart from this
[1:54:05] place what spirit the spirit of love
[1:54:07] that brought about a meeting where some
[1:54:11] people would want to be baptized where
[1:54:13] God could vindicate his word and that
[1:54:17] manifestation of the Word of God was a
[1:54:19] vindication and a guarantee that God
[1:54:22] keeps his word I'm sorry I know I'm
[1:54:25] holding you long but just let me finish
[1:54:27] this quote he says I don't care he said
[1:54:32] if it ever does then I don't care how
[1:54:34] eloquent your pastor might be how well
[1:54:37] he might bring the Word of God
[1:54:38] the Spirit of God has grieved away he
[1:54:41] said when we can have all things in
[1:54:43] fellowship in common love one another
[1:54:46] then God will work with us the only want
[1:54:51] him to work with us they knew they
[1:54:53] needed him jesus said go there and stay
[1:54:55] until you endued with power from on high
[1:54:57] don't we need God to work with us and
[1:55:00] brother brother said and we're keeping
[1:55:02] time that the people come by and say if
[1:55:06] you want to see a church that's really
[1:55:08] humble a church that really loves caught
[1:55:10] drop in up there at that Tabernacle one
[1:55:13] time and watch them hey man look at the
[1:55:18] care they have for one another
[1:55:21] the
[1:55:22] respect when the gospel is being
[1:55:25] preached how Reverend how everything is
[1:55:27] just an order yes he said then they can
[1:55:30] look and see what time we're living hey
[1:55:34] he said well make a look at the
[1:55:35] coronavirus they can look at something
[1:55:37] else to see what time no they can look
[1:55:38] at our law for one another and the care
[1:55:40] in respect we have for one another and
[1:55:42] it's a timepiece to show them what hour
[1:55:45] we're living in he said you'll see the
[1:55:48] Spirit of God moving among you great
[1:55:50] signs and wonders things will be taking
[1:55:52] place he said if the thing is working
[1:55:54] together it's telling the time are you
[1:55:57] hearing me if the thing is working
[1:55:58] together it's telling the time but if it
[1:56:00] isn't working then time has stopped see
[1:56:02] every one of us are essential to every
[1:56:04] church service whether we can be here or
[1:56:05] not whether things happen and maybe we
[1:56:07] can't we can't be here but God makes us
[1:56:09] essential if we're a part of the body
[1:56:11] we're essential to every service we've
[1:56:13] got to be praying we've got to be
[1:56:14] looking forward we've got to be doing
[1:56:15] things and helping and everything that
[1:56:17] we can when we're here we ought to just
[1:56:19] come with such an expectation of God in
[1:56:21] our heart why we're essential if it's
[1:56:23] not working together it's not telling
[1:56:24] the time but if it's working together
[1:56:27] it's telling the time if it isn't
[1:56:29] working time has stopped it won't tell
[1:56:31] the time no more he said so if we want
[1:56:33] to know what time we're living just
[1:56:35] start everybody working together in the
[1:56:37] gospel loving one another loving God and
[1:56:39] the hands itself will tell the time well
[1:56:42] we're living in I'll leave you with this
[1:56:47] love one another above everything that's
[1:56:51] the prophet of God speaking no matter
[1:56:54] what the devil tries to say you're all
[1:56:57] one great big sweet group now but
[1:56:58] remember my warning
[1:56:59] Satan won't let that stay that way he'll
[1:57:02] shoot everything if he has to bring
[1:57:04] somebody in to make his target it brings
[1:57:06] some critic or unbeliever in sit him
[1:57:07] down cause him to fellowship with you
[1:57:09] under the quietness and things he'll
[1:57:10] shoot that guy with some kind of a
[1:57:11] poisonous stuff he'll start through the
[1:57:13] church with it I'm so grateful
[1:57:14] we've had some come sit among us since
[1:57:16] I'm so grateful there's not someone
[1:57:17] coming in as a critic but it's people
[1:57:20] coming in with love I'm grateful for
[1:57:22] that I'm grateful for that people just
[1:57:24] want a place to go to church I think God
[1:57:26] let more come they want to go have a
[1:57:27] place to go to church and worship God
[1:57:29] but sometimes there'll be a critic come
[1:57:32] in and he'll shoot everything yes to
[1:57:34] bring in to make his target it brings
[1:57:35] some credit
[1:57:36] sit him down cause him to fellowship he
[1:57:37] said he'll shoot that guy with some kind
[1:57:39] of poison stuff you know starts to the
[1:57:41] church with it don't you take sides with
[1:57:42] it don't you have nothing to do with
[1:57:44] anything else you stay right loving and
[1:57:46] sweet and kind to one another pray for
[1:57:51] that man he'll be saved too or that
[1:57:52] won't matter ever who it is just pray
[1:57:54] for them and stick one with another John
[1:57:57] 13:34 a new commandment I given to you
[1:57:59] that you love one another as I have
[1:58:01] loved you that you also love one another
[1:58:03] by this shall all men know what time it
[1:58:06] is that you are my disciples if you have
[1:58:08] love one to another musicians come the
[1:58:15] bible says next to two and suddenly
[1:58:17] suddenly I love this there came a sound
[1:58:22] from heaven it was the right place at
[1:58:27] the right time we're at the right place
[1:58:31] in the message of the hour under the
[1:58:33] shed blood of Christ at the right time
[1:58:35] the message has been given the right
[1:58:39] place the right time we're in one Accord
[1:58:42] in one place and suddenly there came a
[1:58:48] sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty
[1:58:50] wind and it filled all the house where
[1:58:53] they were sitting
[1:58:55] you see when we love one another and
[1:58:58] come in one accord the promise of this
[1:59:00] day is manifested among us
[1:59:04] listen Satan will do anything he can to
[1:59:06] keep you from receiving that abstract
[1:59:09] and he'll do anything he can if you've
[1:59:12] received it by the Joe to try to keep
[1:59:13] you from taking advantage of it

[2:00:28] Christ

[2:00:33] want the token over your door we've just
[2:00:36] seen a great natural sickness come in a
[2:00:40] great natural plague we've seen how it
[2:00:44] sneaks into homes till they've said even
[2:00:47] the people that stay home in New York
[2:00:50] where they've done the studies have been
[2:00:52] more susceptible to it than the people
[2:00:54] that got out and it doesn't make any
[2:00:56] sense
[2:00:56] somehow it just sneaks in it's an enemy
[2:01:01] and I've seen enemy that could bring
[2:01:05] down a nation but though we've been
[2:01:08] fighting a greater enemy than the

[2:01:23] preacher's mind and faster television
[2:01:25] you're not even worthy of preaching
[2:01:26] you're not worthy of coming you're not
[2:01:28] worthy of putting yourself before God's
[2:01:30] people the devil works on your mind the
[2:01:33] devil works on deacons and trustees and
[2:01:36] pastors and everybody else
[2:01:37] Psalm leaders he works on everybody it
[2:01:41] comes in your mind and in that unseen
[2:01:43] enemies and tries to make you think that

[2:02:48] from flying over and those little birds
[2:02:50] from coming by and telling me things but
