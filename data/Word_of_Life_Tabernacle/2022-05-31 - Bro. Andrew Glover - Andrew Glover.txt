together heavenly father we're so grateful to be in your presence tonight and to know that you're the same yesterday today and forever and your prophet told us that that was the same in every aspect except for the corporal body lord and what that means to us is that you're a healer today if you were a healer when you were here on the shores of galilee then you're a healer tonight or not pray for each and every one of these requests we think of sister vicky sitting at home and or not able to be at a service i know she would love to be at i pray god that you'd move right now in her situation

together in one mind and one accord may there be a sound from heaven lord is a rushing mighty wind and may there be a reaction like there was on the day of pentecost that we would boldly go and

evening amen how many is one of them tonight amen not by title or not by membership but by birth amen we're one of them tonight amen i was just there in the back room and when brother ben began to sing that song i couldn't help but think of the prophet of god when he was led to go down into memphis and take off walking and he said i was singing that song i'm one of them he said i just learned that met up with you pentecostal folks a few days ago amen and he said i was just going through there singing it amen and i i think it's time to start testifying who we really are amen we're we're not

hearts together for a word of prayer and how may it have a need upon your heart something you would desire from the lord tonight amen he's here to meet our needs heavenly father lord as we gather here this afternoon we have not gathered out of tradition lord we've not gathered out a ritual but father we've gathered here as believers lord and father we believe your word and we believe that your word

no doubt there's healings that are needed deliverance is lord answers direction father as a man i have no ability to help these people but lord i believe that this message has come in this generation

here tonight lord may lives be touched by the pillar of fire lord for those that are at home tonight desiring to be here i pray oh god that your grace would reach down and touch them lord for those

to turn tonight if you have your bibles through the book of john the 17th chapter the book of john the 17th chapter and we want to look here in john 17 we want to greet you this evening on behalf of our pastor brother sean martin the saints there at home brother sean said to be sure and greet you brother ben in the church for him so we definitely want to do that this evening in the book of john the 17th chapter and the 23rd verse jesus here is actually praying for the unity of the church and in the 23rd verse he says i in them and thou and me that they may be made perfect in one and that the world may know some may say the world may know that the world may know that thou hast sent me and has loved them as thou hast loved me i in them and thou in me that they may be made perfect in one and that the world may know so that there would be a manifestation that the world may know that thou has sent me and has loved me has loved them as thou hast love me i want to look with you also in the book of colossians the first chapter of the book of colossians the first chapter and i want to look in the 25th verse you know tonight that this is brother branham's text in christ is the mystery of god revealed in colossians 1 and verse 25 we want to look here paul writing to the church he says whereof i am made a minister according to the dispensation of god which is given to me for you to fulfill the word of god how many knows that brother said the mind of christ is to fulfill his word amen to fulfill the word of god even the mystery which has been hid from ages and from generations but now is made manifest to his saints to whom god would make known what is the riches of the glory of the mystery among the gentiles here it is which is christ in you the hope of glory amen to make known what the riches of the glory of the mystery among the gentiles which is christ in you the hope of glory we ask the lord this evening to add the blessing to the reading of his word as you can be seated here this afternoon for a few moments here tonight i want to speak to you if i can if i title this thought tonight i want to speak to you on living images of true christianity living images of true christianity i i tell you if there's ever been a time to be identified as a christian i believe we're now living in the hour we should be identified as christians and brother branham would preach a message right around this time of year in 1959 he would title that sermon images of christ 1959 images of christ and he says i want to take for a text tonight just for a short time he said the subject of images of christ he said and i want for a subject what does it take to make a christian amen what does it take to make a christian now we know that according to colossians 1 paul writing to the church he says that christ would be in you the hope of glory now we know that paul amen was a church age messenger who was preaching a message of the gospel of the truth which was of christ and we know that according to paul it meant that he would have a ministry but brother branham would come and he would not preach something different than paul but he would preach the same thing paul preached and he would restore to the church amen everything that had been lost to the dark ages and we believe amen that the message of malachi 4 will be amen a message of restoration now it's not a mystery tonight amen that we're living in the hour when all things have been restored right and we believe that the message has restored the way we baptize we believe it's restored the way we we conduct our services it's restored the way we we conduct our communion services it's restored the way that we dress and amen the way we preach the message of the hour amen is a message of restoration now i happen to believe amen that the message did not just restore to us the truth of water baptism or the truth of the godhead or the truth of predestination amen but i believe the message of the hour has restored to us he meant what it means to be a true christian now amen i'll just share a few tapes with you that i've been studying in i'm actually pulling from several of them tonight one of them is images of christ iran preaches christianity versus idolatry a christ is the mystery of god revealed is your life worthy of the gospel amen then he'll preach a message called the oddball and if you listen to those sermons amen you'll be hearing the prophet of god dealing with he meant a christian life now it is your life worthy of the gospel in his prayer he said lord jesus any man physically or woman or child can move back the pages of this bible but there's no one can reveal it but you so i pray lord of taken this text that's placed upon my heart he been descended out across the nation for the people that they might know what type of life is required of them to live amen then there's a life amen and it's a life that god is requiring the church to live he said for so many has asked me is the christian life he meant a life of church service he says is it helping the poor and the needy or is it a constant a member or is it a loyal loyalty to the church and he said such questions he said now father may the correct answer come tonight through these words as we make an endeavor he meant to bring them to the people another place in question answer 64. he said we have a symbol tonight lord for no other purpose but to know how and to learn how by the help to be better christians amen how many could say that's why i'm here tonight amen is to leave here a better christian now a prophet of god told us amen you're going to leave one way or the other you'll either leave better amen or you'll leave worse and i'll say this i happen to believe amen that we have received a message in this generation amen that we don't have to leave one service the same way we came he said we don't have to leave one meeting the same way we came i believe we received a message that has the power he meant to make us more than loyal church members i believe we've received a message amen that has the power to make us more amen than a bunch of people that gather us together three times a week amen and studies a few ideas amen but we have received a message and then that's not a false message but it's a real message and the thinking the age we're living in he meant that the world is hungry for something real the prophet said i'm hungry for real thanks i'm hungry to see a church stand amen in this last days i'm hungry to see a good old-fashioned amen pentecostal body of christ rise in the power of the holy ghost calling right right and wrong wrong my heart longs to see it he said there's a little remnant that's waiting he said they're not waiting to see how big we can make our denomination how well we can dress how big a church we can build amen they're waiting to see us manifest amen the life of the lord jesus christ in love and in power amen i'll stay i'll go a step further and say amen they're not waiting to see how much we can how much we can learn and how best we can approach amen the mysteries of this message amen but the world is looking to see something real amen i think it's time to be quit being just church members i think it's time to quit just coming together and say well we believe a message amen but i believe that the time has come amen that the father must be glorified again and he's not going to raise up paul and he's not going to raise up peter and james he's not going to bring brother branham back he meant to manifest the lion amen but he is raising up a pentecostal body in the power of the holy ghost who will not just manifest him on sunday morning will not just manifest him in a meeting amen but anywhere anytime anyplace under any condition amen they will manifest him as a born-again son and daughter of god listen i'm not just a preacher amen before i was a preacher i was a christian amen you're not just a church member amen before you're a church member you're a christian well we might as well preach amen you're not just a deacon and a sunday school teacher amen and an evangelist ain't that your priority up on the earth he managed to be a christian amen and to manifest jesus christ amen with the same love and the same zeal and the same power that he manifested when he walked here upon the earth we have not come together to see who can be the best preacher who can be the best singer who can build the biggest church who can get the greatest following we have come here ain't meant to let a dying world amen in a dying generation know that we have received a message of life and it's the message of the son of man that has returned in this generation my we're not here ain't meant to manifest our abilities and to manifest our talents and to manifest our ideas we have been placed here amen to manifest jesus christ which under this message amen is a restoration amen i'll tell you this i don't believe god has called us amen to stay where we are i believe he's called us to advance come on i believe every service ought to be an advancement the problem of god said this is the advancement of the gospel amen i believe every service listen i believe that you ought to be further tonight than you were sunday morning and i believe next service you're in you ought to be further than and you are here tonight amen this is not he meant a bunch of people gathered in a building they've been talking about what god used to do amen and becoming stale amen by past experiences but this is the restoration of truth which is essential he meant for the church to advance the prophet said the church can never progress until it knows what's ground just progressing on and i believe that before anybody can ever move or have real confidential faith it's first they have to know amen where they stand and how to stand after they make their stand then a christian's got to know where they stand they've got to know how to make a stand and they got to know how to stand after they made the stand i believe that's essential for you cannot just head long plunge into something with faith when you don't know where you're punching he said you've got to know and if our faith is set right and in the right position amen it gives a constant satisfaction amen that's why a real christian under no matter what circumstances amen by the frank they find themselves under amen they are a real christian amen if they're sick they're a christian if they're broke they're a christian if they're happy they're a christian if the church is warm they're a christian if the church is cold they're a christian listen friends we're not a bunch of denominational amen hatched out hybrid chickens amen that don't know who our papa mama is amen we are eagles that's been born amen by the mama and papa eagle we are come here amen not to let every little thing that comes along ain't meant to move us out of our place of satisfaction amen is there anybody satisfied here tonight is there anybody satisfied with this message is there anybody satisfied with the holy ghost is there anybody satisfied amen that this day this scripture has been fulfilled in our generation i am not a dissatisfied christian i am satisfied by the message of the hour that no matter how low we are we are a christian no matter how sad we are we are a christian that's what separates you amen from 3 000 plus denominations it's no matter what you go through when you come out of it you're still a christian no matter how dark it gets you're still a christian it's a position by faith amen real confidential faith that has given us a constant satisfaction and may i say tonight amen i personally believe amen that the most solemn confession that you can make in this life is that you are a christian i don't believe the most solemn confession you can make is that you are a preacher i don't believe in those psalm confession you can make is that you preach 52 weekends out of the year or you sing 17 different conventions amen i believe that the most solemn confession ain't been that somebody can make in this generation and an untoward generation when they're a bunch of god denied ain't been fussing fighting people amen somebody can be alive on a city amen that is on a hillside and then they cannot be put out by the pressures of the day they're living in amen let me just go and say it i am a christian i'm proud to be a christian i'm honored to be a christian i'm thankful to be identified amen as a follower of jesus christ in the age i'm living in now to thank that we are created amen in the image of god now you know you that study know amen that the image of god amen is not a natural image it is a divine image and according to genesis 5 1 the bible says this is the book of the generations of adam amen i feel good here tonight amen this is the book of the generations of adam in the day that god created man notice it doesn't say man created god amen but in the day that god created man notice the next words in the likeness of god made he him in the likeness that word likeness can also be transferred he meant to the word image or figure or likeness it is an image of things it is the heavenly things they've been used to the moral likeness of renewed men amen to god somebody say renewed renewed men to god it is the image of the son of god into which true christians are transformed it's the image of the son of god into which two christians are transformed is likeness not unto the heavenly body but also to the most holy and blessed state of mind which christ possesses amen it means the image of one it is one in whom the likeness of anyone has seen is applied to man on account of this power of command it is of christ on account of this divine nature and his absolute moral excellence that god created man in the likeness of god in the in the transformation of god amen in the image of god amen created he both male and female right but here the bible's showing us amen that god has created a people to be transformed into the image of his son amen i'll say it like this as christians amen we are to manifest amen jesus christ amen in every aspect of our lives amen in our in our marriages we all manifest christ in our families we ought to manifest christ in our business affairs we all manifest christ in the way we treat one another we ought to manifest christ in the way we approach these services we ought to manifest christ amen as christians we have been put here to manifest the life of jesus christ that the world may know that there has been a uniting between god and his bride now if you look in the bible you'll see the word christian or the word christians there it's used about three times in acts 11 26 it says when he which is speaking about a barnabas had found him he besought him unto antioch brought him into antioch and it came to pass that a whole year they assembled themselves with the church and taught much people and the disciples were called christians first in antioch think about this the disciples were called christians first in antioch and in acts 26 28 then agrippa said unto paul amen almost thou persuades me amen to be a christian in first peter 4 16 the bible says if any man suffer as a christian amen let him not be ashamed but let him glorify god on this behalf what i'm saying is your life worthy of the gospel he said a christian is not a tool it's not some mechanical wrench amen to a great big religious regime amen a christian is not some kind of tool that keeps a religious organization moving amen that is not a christian he said a christian is to be christ-like he meant that the identifying characteristic of a christian is not the ability to debate it is not the ability to fuss it is not the ability to keep things always tore up and divided but the identifying mark of a christian is the ability to be christ-like and a christian cannot be a christian until christ comes into the man and the life of christ is in him he said then it produces the life that christ lived and you do the things that christ did he says what am i talking about amen personal relationship to christ amen he didn't say brotherdale personal membership to the church he didn't say personal personalities to the people he said i'm talking about a personal relationship to christ you know the only way that you can come to a personal relationship is through a new birth they meant church membership won't do it amen learning quotes won't do it memorizing things won't do it the only route to a personal relationship with christ is the new birth amen i'll say to you like this a christian amen means to be a follower of christ it means to be christ-like or it means to be like christ amen do you realize we have so many amen explanations and definitions today of what a christian is amen the problem god will tell us in his day that there was around 900 different denominations do you realize tonight amen around the world there is some 3 000 plus amen denominations they've been trying to identify you they've been the baptists are trying to identify you the presbyterians are trying to identify you ain't been they're all trying to give you a definition or explanation amen what a christian is amen but let us be glad and rejoice that we have been given a message of restoration he meant to restore us back amen to what the bible definition of a christian is listen we're not just a bunch of bible preachers and a bunch of bible singers amen we're bible christians we've been restored by the voice of malachi 4 we have been restored back to what the true identity of a christian really is remember said many times amen is this okay he says we hear the expression oh what is a christian amen some people limit it to joining a church amen someone said well a christian is a church member it's someone who takes up their affiliations with the church i believe that all christians should do that amen but i don't believe that's christianity amen that's what a christian does after somebody shout after he becomes a christian it doesn't mean that because he does it that he is a christian then some will say no it's going to church and serving a declaration of creeds and being loyal to those things with the churches teach and then there are others that say perhaps they've meant packing a little something on them a little cross or something amen that that is the sign of a christian now i'm going to take the breaks off and preacher for a second hey because if you saw a catholic event packing a cross around you'd say well they're trying to have a sign of a christian amen if you if you've seen a baptist they've been wearing a pen on their coat and identifying there was a southern baptist you'd say well they're trying to have a sign of a christian well i'm going to take the gloves off and say amen packing around the suitcase of a replica of brother branham's amen is no different than some baptist they've been wearing a sign on their shirt listen we're not identified by brother branham's suitcase we're not identified by pen and says i'm a tape follower we are identified by the life of jesus christ that was poured out on the day of pentecost you want to be identified as a christian it ain't what pen you wear it ain't what camp you associate around it's can you go to the upper room can you go with 120 when can you go and be baptized in my name for the remission of sin and receive the mark of the christian which is the baptism of the holy ghost empire i say tonight friends our young people need to know that their identification is more than their long hair and their long dress and a spoken word book under their arm their identification is the same god that was in jesus has returned in this generation and by a new birth has taken possession in a vessel that the world may know that they're not just a young man and they're not just a young woman they're a living identified christian the almighty god in the age they're living in the sign of a christian it's not the color of coach you wear it's not the pen you wear on your coat it's a life you live yes i think that devil got out of here that's the sign of a christian yeah come on wait a minute we ain't a bunch of cultures people ain't been running around trying to tip our hat like brother random and wear a belt buckle like he oh god well it's the truth anyhow amen we're christians here tonight we're not a bunch of heretics we're christians here tonight we're real believers in jesus christ the sign of a christian then there's others who believe amen that perhaps maybe if they would burn a candle or do some kind of penance amen that's a christian if they'll merely be immersed in water or they'll do some sacrifice or they'll give some good to the church or they'll help the neighbor well i pick that up sometimes we'll preach even people say well amen i really can't live the word so i'll just be good to the bride and i'll make it as one that was good in the bride well that's ok that's all well and good but the problem i've got with that amen is jesus said and that day they'll say amen when did we do this amen so they was unknowledgeable of what they was doing amen being good to the bride amen was not another route to salvation being good to the bride was not the opening of the door even for somebody who didn't want to die out to themselves and let the flesh be mortified amen by the spirit of god but i say tonight there's a pride on the earth who's not an immature bride she's a mature bride and she can take the heat brother danny or the sunlight and it can bake all the greenness out of it oh god have mercy we ain't a bunch of babies around here we're some real rugged christians we're some real world born believers you can't preach it too hot and you can't preach it too easy amen you can shut the heart off of us amen but we'll still be here amen because we didn't come in by handshake and we can't go out by hurt feeling we came in by the baptism of the holy ghost and fire and you can't preach this message hot enough to run an eagle off well somebody might as well say amen if you come in by a handshake you'll go out by a hurt feeling if you come in by your favorite singer you'll go out by somebody that can't carry a tune in a bucket but if you come in by the baptism of the holy ghosted power when the world is shifting sand you'll be standing on christ the solid rock yes sir come on i'm not talking about church members i'm talking about christians [Applause] true christians yeah well we'll just want to speak good to our neighbor we'll buy some coal for the winter we'll we'll buy some shoes for the orphanage he said that's acts of a christian yeah he said those are the things that you should do but that steel doesn't make you a christian well let's keep on going can we can we stay in the presence of god amen then some says that if you pack an image of christ in your car or on your wall that is a sign of a christian amen well then things are all right amen but i don't believe amen that packing an image somebody say pack in an image i don't believe that packing an image makes you a christian he said i believe that being an image of christ amen makes you a christian now we're going to turn a corner okay he says it's not what we do outwardly it's what happened inwardly that makes us what we are yeah well that kicks legalism right out the door don't it amen and there goes the measuring stick right out the door because if you get the holy ghost them skirts will get longer and if you get the holy ghost then heels will get lower to the ground and if you get the holy ghost that makeup will go out the door well godly mouse will preach if you get the holy ghost you won't have to worry about that television in your living room if you get the holy ghost it won't be the preacher preaching on you it'll be the holy ghost inside of you they've been burning sin out of you by an experience of a new birth well that's the truth any house we might as well preach i think it's time to bring a standard back to the house of god i think it's time to get rid of these sissified amen panty-wasted preachers that ain't got the guts to stand up and say what a prophet said i think our young girls need to know it's a sin to wear makeup i think our young boys need to know what you're saying ain't been to run around in a pair of swords like some big find society well we might as well preach anyhow i think our women ought to know amen that you're out of the will of god trying to tell your husband how to run the house i think our husbands ought to know you've got a position not to be a dominating male anything but to be a leader in your household what did this message come to do did it come together something to shout about did it come together something to be puffed up about i seen this message come ain't meant to restore the image of what a true christian is in the age we're living here it ain't a bunch of fights and then dominating females running the church it's the bride of jesus christ in submission to her lord by the spirit of god well it's a truth anyhow amen i'll tell you what's well god have mercy might as well preach amen amen that's going on so we might as well preach and because we got kids growing up that never saw him in the order of the house now they grow up and think that's the way things ought to be and then we got young girls getting married in fact the first time the preacher preaches on makeup they tell their husbands we ain't going back i tell you what they mean we need some boys to get a backbone and be a leader in this generation and quit being a liberal that wouldn't know a backbone if you met in a 10-acre field i'm not a politician i'm a preacher are you hearing me this message come to restore true christianity well brother andrew that's whole school will you tell me how cumberland was preached on after the seals was open well glory to god it's getting hot in here but we're going to preach right through you tell me how come the prophet of god was still saying then pain and face jezebel's not one of those two acts 238 hollering screaming youngins it would be a miserable embarrassment to her i'll tell you why it's because they wanted church without the holy ghost they wanted religion without the holy ghost they wanted a happy sound time without the holy ghost remember this message has restored and then the holy ghost to the church and for the first time in two thousand years we ain't a bunch of bubble banks and church members we are some anthocon we are some team seeds of god who has been known from the mind of god and if we shout we're shouting because we're restored if we dance we're dancing because we're restored if we run the aisles we're running the aisles because we've been restored yes we ain't here playing church we are the church we ain't here playing the holy ghost the holy ghost just come in and we give him right away in our lives something's going to happen on the inside and it'll move to the outside right good oh preacher you're old school you didn't have to tell me i already knew that and what you don't know is what old school is is what's on them tapes come on you wanna you wanna go there we'll go there please pray and just play tapes we'll do that amen but if you're gonna do it do what's on the tapes come on now if you're going to say that then say what's on the page and the prophet said what the church needs is a good old-fashioned saint paul's revival and the bible holy ghost back in the church he said we need some preachers it won't be a bunch of hollywood lads but they'll stand in the pulpit and they'll call black black and white white and wrong wrong and right right and will produce a change in the lives of the hearers by the word of god [Music] somebody ought to say amen we're not a bunch of church members we're christians come on we're not we're not here tonight y'all didn't gather up here tonight ain't been to pay your monthly news to the church you gathered here to receive something from god you gathered here to receive a change to receive a power to receive a zeal in your life it means something going to happen on the inside and it'll move to the outside well then you get people say well amen it's all grace and it's all oh god have mercy brother man i'm trying to preach but i can't get out of this they say well it's all grace now and so it don't matter i'll tell you this amen you can't get something on the inside and it not reflect on the outside come on come on amen you you can't get something inside and not move to the outside then the prophet said christianity is not what happened outwardly it's what happened inwardly that makes us what we are then therefore if he is our image and we are in his likeness and members of his body then we should be images like him that our lives somebody say our lives not our sermons not our songs not our quote books our lives should reflect the image of christ not in our joining church or in our in our packing of crucifix or our emotions but it should be in the living presence of the living god that's reflected through our lives you say preacher our emotions pentecostals are a prime example of of a person that's identifying their identification as a christian upon their emotions because you crank up the music and you get the guitar hot and they'll shout the house down but you meet him on monday morning amen and the prophet god said you'll hear some good old-fashioned pentecostal cuts and he said you know why even because their experience didn't go no further than as loud as the music went amen but i rebuke every devil it's trying to shut the move of god down around the bride of jesus christ we are not shouting because somebody's playing our favorite song we are shouting because we've been changed it's jesus on the inside and he's working on the outside i'm talking about a bunch of drunks that's been made real fathers i'm talking about a bunch of gossipers that's been set free by the power of the holy ghost i'm talking about somebody that's met god for themselves and they know him in the power of his regeneration made a bunch of bubble dancers it's jesus on the inside and he's working on the outside oh what a change glory to god it's jesus on the inside and he's working on the outside what a change is in our lives the father said church membership is all right i have nothing against it but brother to be a christian means to be conformed to the image of christ we are to be living images not pack an image but be an image of the lord jesus christianity versus idolatry we are made partakers of his holiness we the bride are made partakers of his holiness we in his image we are living images of a living god are you ready for this then dead to self but i could preach there for two hours and raised with him we're dead to save and raise him remember that right i'll tell you what amen i'm born again holy ghost field fire baptized christian and you're the center i've ever been in trouble that happens in the church your name is associated with every bit of division around the community i'll tell you what something went wrong somewhere even because the prophet of god said if you ever get the holy ghost he said somebody come around you're trying to talk negative and you'll say don't come around me talking like that amen i'm not a cesspool and the holy ghost ain't a cesspool either dead to self come on well amen amen now we might as well preach dead to self that means it sure won't amen i've been killed by the baptism of the holy ghost well i tell you what i don't like i don't like how loud the sound system is i don't like how cold the air canister is i don't like how many services sometime another you gotta die to yourself and i'll just go ahead and tell you right now hey but if you think it's a little bit too loud here amen if you ever make it to hell come on now yeah if you think it's a little too uncomfortable here if you ever make it to heaven amen you'll remember this was the quietest place amen you ever was because brother harvey you get a bunch of redeemed vessels of god to care on the streets of gold beholding the tree of life you think i shout down here you ain't seen nothing yet you think with dance down here you ain't seen nothing yet listen if you go to hell they're going to be hollering and screaming and wailing and gnashing teeth and they're going to be doing it because they missed it and if you go to heaven we're going to be shouting and we're going to be hollering and we're going to be rejoicing amen not because we missed it but brother danny because we made it we made it out of laodicea we made it to the other side our family made it our church made it our family members that we never thought would make it are there yes sir well glory to god i think it's time to break out with all this church hannity and come back to what a real christian is yes well preacher we've died to ourselves the part of god said dead to yourself and his word made flesh again somebody say again his word made flesh again in us now watch what is it not the mythical imaginary god setting out there but the living god are you ready for this what is the living god it's the word in you making itself real yes brother joe that's a mouthful for the word in you making itself real then the world is hungering for something real the world is waiting for somebody amen brother to manifest the life of christ yes the prodigal said what is the living god it's the word in you making itself real everybody said woo glory to god i know you think i'm a holy roller and maybe i am but brother do you see it he said do you see it amen triumph over every denomination that's why we're shouting as we escaped the damnable heresies of three thousand plus denominations that's why we're rejoicing as we escaped amen the grip of babylon by the voice of the seventh angel that's why we're running the aisles it's because we heard a prophet saying that you're not going to tribulation for perfection amen but the blood of jesus christ had the power of atonement and the power of perfection that puts you out of time back into eternity triumph over every denomination triumph over all paganism a living god may manifest in a living temple and the word of god which his god is made flesh in you he said why you are seated in heavenly places triumphed over all things in christ jesus brother ben we are not going to heavenly places we are in heavenly places brother harvey hey we're there we're not looking for it we're right in the middle of it oh you want another one here it is oh it's silly to the people they don't get it but they were not born somebody said born they were not born to get it so they won't get it even the bible said so amen but god always feels his temple somebody say it the day of dedication as the day of dedication he fills his temple he fills it with himself the same thing today amen god will feel somebody say god will fail he will fill every temple that will thoroughly dedicate itself to him any person that will brother brother dale i mean when this when this when this quote come alive to me i'm sitting in a hotel room in stillwater oklahoma let's get ready for win the brother when martin's dedication means and i was just the prophet preached on the dedication and he said they built the temple he said they had all the furniture in there but he said they had all the curtains there he said everything was just right he said but now watch he said they all gathered there for a dedication service he said but the dedication was not the gathering of the people it was the feeling of the vessels with the presence of god he said see they could have everything finished and not the sound of the hammer or the buzz of a saw but unless god come down with his presence and then it was another building with another bunch of furniture but it was an undedicated temple i said oh god amen don't ever let our churches and then be fancy buildings with fancy instruments and fancy furniture but the presence of the living god listen i say tonight oh god if we lose all of our music and we lose all of our technology don't ever let us lose your presence it'll be another building with another bunch of people but if the presence of god comes in it'll change young people it'll heal our sick it'll raise the dead it'll save the laws it'll restore the backslider it'll feel the empty mess so i'm talking about the original dedication christ coming in the temple with his very presence this temple is not this little building here the temple is not the one in salt lake city the temple's not in rome the temple is you since that's a powerful fault the temple is you you are the temple that god wants to dwell in come on now you'll all agree that god wants to dwell in you amen but will you amend the rest of this quote and express himself amen through you that all nations might know him yes then what was the prayer of the one god and the one church in john 17. it was father that i would be in them and they would be in me that the world may know that the world may know that they're not just a bunch of church members they're not just a bunch of deacons of trustees they are the living breathing epistles by the almighty god and the age they're living in that the world may know sisterhead the world may know that you are living images of god that god wants to work through come on friends you let god fill you when you as a 15 year old girl you let god fill you when you as a 40 year old man but when in god's name are you gonna let him express himself through you he did not just feel you ain't then just so you can walk around full he filled you because he has no hands but your hands he has no ears but your ears he has no eyes but your eyes he has no mouth but you're about come on friends we have not been dedicated to be a bunch of busters and fighters we have been dedicated that on our jobs and our schools and our communities the world may know that religion is not a bunch of scamming ain't been perverting me and trying to swindle people out of money it's jesus christ returning to this generation in flesh again oh god somebody give him some praise somebody give him some praise let the alpha god that's on the inside of you express itself through a dedicated vessel through a dedicated mouth through a dedicated voice oh god i know i know denomination amen is cheap in the term christian and for that i am ashamed yes that's the truth it's a shame what they've done to christianity they have cheapened christianity down to a bunch of old people sitting in a building fussing over how much money is in the bank account what color carpets put on the floors who gets to pay what and who oh god and our young people drying up and died well i might as well preach they may not be fussing around around the money account on the carpet but now they get behind the pulpit and they fight somebody 500 miles down the road because of some little ill feeling 20 years ago when in god's name are you going to let the past amen be the past and preach to these young people that need to know the same god that you met as a young man can come to them and they're not seasoned amen time i get done tonight brother ben i may not have one pulpit but you're going to hear the truth tonight it's time to quit making the bible stand a boxing ring it's time to make it a place ain't meant to knock the devil out of lies to knock the devil our young people are the lead church on fire they simply wonder who the preachers against and who the preacher don't like and who heard him 40 years ago they ought to leave knowing that god is still god and his word is still true and his power is still real and his anointing is still flowing upon prepared dedicated vessels in the age they're living in [Applause] bury the fight and preach the gospel come on somebody bury the fact preach the gospel keep the politics out of the house of god and bring the power of god back in the church right we got young people addicted to pornography and preachers will spend 30 minutes billy again while they didn't get to preach some meeting and young people bound by demons out of hell among somebody well that's god's truth anyhow amen we got marriages on the rocks and a bunch of preachers will stand the pulpit and bellyache about where they didn't get invited to and who didn't like him and oh god we're in god's name are you gonna grow up and preach the gospel and if you ain't going to preach it then sit down and let somebody up who will preach it because we need a change our homes need to change our young people need a change our families need to change and the only way it can come is the living presence of god be welcome back in the church again right well who are you after the devil yeah who you fight every spirit out of hell that tries to bring the people of god back into bondage again we have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but the spirit of power and of love and of a sound mind well no i'm not i'm not running out of something to say i'm giving that devil a minute to take his tail and get out of here we're done with your fights we're done with your fusses we're not here for politics we're not gathered here tonight amen to see who's who we've gathered here to make christ amen the preeminence of our home to make christ the preeminence of our singing among church and then tear down every personality and lift up the rock carry on every man's idea and lift up the message until christ becomes king in every life [Applause] come back and line up to the scripture we're so glad we have a god amen just not an imaginary god amen an imaginary idol or an imaginary spirit there's nothing imaginary about it brother joe there's nothing imaginary about this message he said it's all true and living god who lives with us and is in us works through us are you ready for this not making a statue to god but we being living images of god we've been living images of god the holy spirit not speaking through a statue but speaking through a redeemed vessel god manifested in flesh how we thank thee lord that this great pillar of fire is following us or we're following it rather and all the great manifestations of the same spirits doing the same work that he always does when it comes on earth what a consolation it gives us yes somebody asked me one time they said brother andrew why don't you talk about all the problems you're going through and all the little hurts you've been on in the field and ministry i told them i said well the problem is i ain't got time to they said well brother brother they said why don't you have time to i said because i listen to too many tapes and i hear too much on them tapes that don't give me no time to talk about all the people that's hurt me and all the people that's letting me down listen friends amen we didn't come together to waste time tonight we come to hear what the spirit is saying to the churches and the spirit is saying greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world and if god be for us then who can be against us i'm not focusing on who's against me everybody may be against me but what difference does it make if all hell is against us if all heaven is behind us and all of heaven is behind this message all of heaven is behind this show up on young people i didn't come to tell you everything that's against you i come to tell you what's behind you and there's more with you than there is with that path there's more with you than there is with that devil against you there's more with this church for the caleb than there is and all the demon powers in hell that is against it [Applause] open up your eyes and recognize who you are you're the bride of jesus christ you're the place oh god brother man can i say it this way you're the answer to jesus prayer you are the place where all the world may know that i have returned in the flesh again by the baptism of the holy ghost he's the bride yeah nobody shout the bride is the living image of christianity today the bride is the living image of christianity today and come on friends we didn't become christians by our mother or father's desire that's why mother and father can forsake you and it don't shake you come on amen that's why you didn't become a christian because you heard a sermon from your favorite preacher that's why your favorite preacher can leave the message and you're still following it because you were not a man chosen to be a christian by a man's desire you were not put in by a man's personality the prophet of god said we were elected to be christians all the father has given me will come to me the bible says send unto you that no man can come unto me except that we're given unto him of my father remember it says how many christians are here raise up your hand how many christians are here he says raise up your hand you're not a christian by your desire you're a christian by god's desire brother brother but justin that's worth repeating you're not a christian by your desire you're a christian by god's desire no man can come to me except my father draws him first you oh god you was elected by god before the foundation of the world to be a christian then the prophet takes that and turns it to a little boy named david what did david write he said though my father forsake me and my mother forsake me the lord will take me up david said i once was young but now i'm old and i've never seen the righteous forsaken or received begging for brother perez there was something in my heart that tells me david didn't have an easy life david didn't always have a sunny sky amen and a steel brook to sit by david had some rough days david brother david david had some rough days but there was one thing about david amen david was positionally placed by the desire of almighty god that's why he could slay the bear and he could slay the line and when goliath raised up his head he could say listen here i've done killed a bear i didn't kill the lion you might as well get in line because you're next there was no condition that david found himself in that could remove his constant satisfaction that god was jehovah and his strength was from everlasting unto everlasting mind and to think tonight friends we're not a bunch of we're not a bunch of finicky christians what's that thing the world says get out of your feelings even we in our feelings amen there's people here who's got every right not to be here they've been hurt they've been let down they've been disappointed they've been ridiculed mocked fun of amen but brother harold we're still in that glorious number we're still following the pillar of power sister e why are we still here because the people who heard us didn't put us in and they can't take us out we must put here to be a christian by the desire of almighty god i'm on church amen since god led you to the position you're in upon the almighty god it was his desire for the curse amen that you would be a real christian it was god's desire and therefore god put you in that position and then he come to you in the form of el shaddai even the breasted god the old in the new testament and he said listen joel i'm gonna call you out and i'm going to open your eyes to your position but you won't be able to stay in it unless you receive some strength to withstand the critics to withstand the naysayers so i'm going to reveal myself to you that's the old in the new testament and you're going to nurse my life into i'm on church the reason we're still standing ain't because it's a human strength we have received the strength of your shady eye from the breast of god and it's given us strength to stand when the rest are back enough we're still standing by the desire yes sir oh god hallelujah oh god i cannot shout right now brother ben god didn't you didn't stumble in that position it was god's desire you would feel that position god knew what was going to come your way god knew the battle she was going to face but he said i'll give you my strength to stay in position come on yes sir god have mercy hallelujah come on bride if you can stay in position you're in line for a miracle if you can stay in position you're in line for body change if you can nurse milsharia your healing is not coming your healing is here oh god somebody rejoice somebody welcomed him in this place he's the living god he's the mighty god [Applause] we're not here by our desire we're here by his desire he had a desire from before the foundation of the world and nothing passed come on what did paul say he said nothing past prison or future can separate me from the love of god i can stop here brother danny and preach to you all night amen how many things in your christian journey has tried to separate you from the position god called you to come on brother brother daniel brother sorry brother shameless how many things have tried to separate you from the position god called you to as a husband as a father as a leader how many people how many devils have tried to separate you from the place god called you to but you're still here tonight you know why because you're not here by your desire because your desire resides to human strength but god's desire has a constant supply of supernatural el shatter our strength from the rest of from the rest of their shady eye [Applause] what are you saying i'm saying you're real christians yes sir felt pretty good did it buddy i'm saying you're real christians amen amen that one brother andrew caused him to raise his hand that was the pulsation of his father's desire of who put him in his position on the tuesday night amen reminded him you were not put here to be a billboard for every division in this message you were not put here to be a voice of broadcast for every ill feeling you must put here to manifest the fruits of the spirit the love and joy and long-suffering of almighty god we were put here by god's desire you were prettier on god's purpose and i said to you like this outside of this message you cannot be a real christian outside of this message you cannot be a real christian verb said you always was an attribute of god he said if not you're just a mimic of christianity are you ready for this there'll be millions brother david and billions he says they'll just be mimics of christianity yeah they'll just be mimics of christianity you say mimics yeah the bible says how being in vain can i have a few more minutes how being in vain do they worship me do they the mimics teaching doctrines the commandments of man jeremiah 17 10 he says but i the lord o god i the lord search the heart [Music] i try the reigns even to give every man according to his ways according to the fruit of his doings oh god if you can stay in position you're going to see the fruit of the suffering if you can stay in position you're going to see the fruit of old church how many devils come on fathers how many devils is as a father with that little baby girl of yours did the devil try to rob you out of your position as her father and her hunter and her protector and come on how many how many fathers and mothers have we got here at the devil trying to rob you of your position to be a real father and a real mother over that child amen and for 18 years or 20 years you've suffered through hard times amen but one day you saw him go to the altar and receive the holy ghost they're on fire for god deny they got kids to their own and message churches you know what i'm saying to you i'm saying you saw the fruit glory to god you saw the fruit of being a real christian oh it was hard but you stayed in position because you knew who you was you was not a mimic of what christianity was supposed to be he was a real oh god the pressure got hot on you on wednesday night when there was a soccer game going on down at the other church but you took him to an old-fashioned prayer meeting but you stayed in position even because you didn't want him to grow up and be a hot-bed mimic you wanted him to be a real genuine eagle and you stayed in position and you see the fruit right hallelujah we're not a bunch of mimics of christianity we're real rugged christians [Applause] was it hard was it hard was it hard oh god can i just take some liberty was it hard but you held your position because you knew it wasn't your desire to be there it was god's brother men how many times did you almost told your bible and say i can't do it i can't preach tonight i can't preach sunday morning but some way somehow you found your position and you open the bible and you begin to preach the word you know why amen because if you was here by your desire every little ill feeling would take you out but when you've been hand-picked and elected by the hand of almighty god to stand in your position you might as well square your shoulders back look that devil square in the face and say there ain't nothing you can do to remove me from my position my jesus prayed for me that i would live in this position and manifest to the world what a real christian is sir why does god call them churches and closing he said they are the false vine why is he still calling churches he said the truth of the matter is they're christians the false vine is christians he says but they're not christians of the spirit they're christians of the flesh oh now we found it didn't we brother david something happened on the outside but it never happened on the inside they got a change of they got a change of look but they never got to change a heart he said see and they are bearing the name in vain well god i didn't make that devil match i might as well make him a little bit madder are you hearing me are you hearing me amen amen they're bearing the name in vain movie night on the movie night on sunday night circus night on wednesday night bowl game night well come on friends it's no different than around the message we got people that will make efforts to make sure their kids are at everything but the house of god and then they get about 15 16 years old and they're running from the from god they want nothing to do with a youth group they want nothing to do with church and you scratch your fingers in your head and say well i wonder what happened i'll tell you what happened is you bowed your knee to a spirit of what christianity is it's letting your kids have their way and oh god come on you say preacher you're crazy for preaching like this no i'm not i'm a young man who didn't have a father in my life i come up in a broken home amen but i met god for myself and wherever my convictions are coming from they're not coming from a church they're not coming from a preacher they're coming from this message and i heard a prophet say you ought to cancel everything and make sure you're in the house of god yes sir i know it ain't popular i know it ain't fancy but it's still the truth you ought to cancel them bowl games to be in the house of god you ought to cancel them trips oh god you say preacher are you saying we should go on vacation no but don't you think 12 vacations in one week is a little excessive and don't you think it's a little odd every time you go on vacation is when they're having a meeting at the church well preach somebody we might as well don't you think it's a little odd that your kid knows everything about soccer but they don't know nothing about the seventh seal don't you think it's a little odd that you can't know everything about hollywood and they come to church you don't have to make them to stay awake at the ball game but you got a program to stay awake at the house of god you know why it's because you had an old lukewarm americanized cheaper definition of what christianity is come upon you but is there anybody here tonight ready to break free from that fame and say if we're going to be christians we're going to be real rugged christians we're going to be christians when it's easy we're going to be christians when it's hard we're going to be christians when it's popular and we're going to be christians when it's done yes sir we're real christians yeah we're not a bunch of men extended up here on the hillside we're real christians [Applause] i think that devil got out of here well they say make america great again i say make the house of god great again america's going to hell won't you make what's important great again won't you make a prayer meeting great again don't you make an old-fashioned altar but i guess it's the evangelist coming out tonight are y'all hearing me won't we make serving god great again what we will our whole god people make jokes about how late they are in the house of god like in some little hahaha moment oh god well i had got somebody he said well we made it just in time amen for alfred hahaha i didn't ha ha ha cause that ain't funny it's a shame that you're not late for work but you come dragging in halfway through the sermon [Applause] y'all may not want me back out here in july but you're gonna hear the truth tonight it's the word of god we're not a bunch of mimics of christianity we're real christians come on ame and this ain't some get this thing some casual they've been gathering the social gospel well i'll just casually sing and i'll just casually preach the sermon i say thank god william branham wasn't a casual preacher i say thank god that there's some rugged preachers that'll still take a sword to ever dabble and come and say come on church let's be a real living image of what a christian is real christians yeah come on now i'm coming to a close but real christians don't get in their car and run the pastor down when the service is over mimics of christianity well come on it's in the message brother said where did them kids come under a spirit to call elijah old bald head he said because her mom and daddy had been talking about elijah and they're oh god their conversation had amen cheapened elijah's influence over the life of their kids and they went out there and they saw elijah and they said old bald head yes and 42 she bears come out of the woods and killed them innocent kids you know what they felt oh god have mercy they fell victim to a spirit on their parents that they should have dealt with 20 years ago well come on friends i'm just following god right now i think it's time that our kids are not a part of church disagreements that happened 50 years ago i don't think our 10 year old kids ought to be able to rehearse church splits that happened 20 years ago i think somewhere sometimes we ought to take a sword and we ought to bury that hatchet we're not about come on you know what that generation was divided but come on young people you've not been brought up under a spirit of mission this is a message of unity this is a message of agreement i'm all i know they have their questions i know they had their parents but somewhere somehow their old founders died off and a new generation rose up you're saying preacher are you saying i'm too old to be a part of this new generation this ju new generation is not based upon age number it's based upon attitude caleb was 80 years old and he still had a good attitude towards the mental promise of god and it come to pass you want to change the way your kids act in the house of god quit second guessing everything the pastor said come on yes indeed they're christians yeah i'm closer right here what else could they be i'm a hominid instead of a that's his religion no matter how he lives it because he subscribes in theory to what the quran teaches but to theorize christians in the same way a christian is a christian as long as he subscribes to the fact that jesus is the son of god born of a virgin crucified died and rose again he's the savior of mankind now here's where i'm closing it in fact in the laodicean age there will be those who call themselves christians because they subscribe to the fine qualities of jesus but here's the point while reserving brother david to themselves the right to deny his deity christian scientists have done that already as well here it is as well as multitudes who preach a social gospel he's a nominal christian he belongs to the church but he is not a true or spiritual believer then you pray tell me what a true spiritual believer is well i got malachi 4 on record a believer who has been baptized into the body of christ and is a member of him but nonetheless it's god's order the tares grow up with the wheat and they are not to be uprooted that is the command of god their day for binding and burning is coming but not yet so the spirit is speaking to this mixed group on one hand he is praising on the other he is rebuking he is told what is right with the true believer well there are me about here tonight could say preacher i want to be a true believer i don't want to be a cheap reproduction a mimic of christianity yes i want to be a real christian yes i wanna i want the way i conduct myself to be a living image of jesus christ yes i want our musician to come he said with andrew it's hard it's hard to be a real christian the prophet god said watch he said we're living images expressing god he said every man that didn't believe god was considered an oddball now i'm going to slow down right here and lay some lay some word in here strong don't you let what a social lay on a scene backslidden denominational group identifies a christian intimidates you for your conviction don't you let what laodicea says a christian is intimidate what a god-called christian is they've already defined what a family is it's a man married to a man and they have a child by some by some by some perverted something it's a woman married to amen now come on friends that's what that that's what they say a fam that's the modern family and for you to teach your boy he's a boy you're an oddball well a few days back god's grace we're going to have a boy and that boy's going to know he is a boy my convictions ain't coming from a preacher they're coming from a prophet [Applause] where's your convictions coming from i think our young girls ought to know they're not a bunch of tomboys they're young ladies well let's stand we might as well how many can say tonight i want to be a real christian are you willing to be a christian a real spiritual christian even though it's classified as an oddball are you willing to hold your convictions are you willing to as a young man i'll share this with you i'll open up a little bit about my life tonight as a young man not growing up rather than with the influence of a father in my heart as a young man as a teenage boy when i would hear what i considered real holy ghost field meant examples that i saw give a little piece of advice i'd say i'm going to keep that i'm going to rest for that one and brother joel i got to doing something one time i got to take it some of those things and i got to look at the message and brother frank what they were living by is what a prophet taught and then i found the cult where a prophet of god said an evening time message will produce even time results i said that's why their kids are serving god that's why their families saved it's been listen i know this ain't popular but i'm preaching to you from my heart i think it's time there ought to be a difference between message churches and denominational churches and i think it's a time we stop bowing our head and being embarrassed to say we believe malachi 4. i think it's time to quit being ashamed to say that we pattern our lives after the voice of the seventh angel come on the prophet god said who is this melchizedek he said when you heard the word for your day he said the living image of the living god he said you left the other thing you heard from your theophany i don't know about you all but tonight i'm gonna follow a message you can tell me where my theophany is i'm gonna follow a message brother frank it can lead me back to my theophany will there be one here tonight i can say god i want to be a real christian you know the only way you can have that is by a new birth and you was elected before the foundation of the world to be born again it's your turn brother says in this quote he says by heart you know what he said even so we in his eter in his thoughts in our turn became the many members spoken word seed manifested in flesh and those eternal faults now manifested flesh are the sons of god even as we are so called we did not become seed by the rebirth we were seed and therefore we were reborn for only the elect can be reborn because we were seed is the reason we can be quickened in non-seed there's nothing to quicken i don't know about you tonight friends but this is my heart's prayer i want to be a living image of true christianity i don't want to have a reputation within the four walls of this building and a different one in school i don't want to have a good reputation here and a different one on my on my job on my workforce what about you i'm abusing you as an illustration can you say god if the church people can say i'm a christian let the biggest drunk on my job so i'll be able to say that's a real christian i know i'm preaching long you forgive me but i gotta leave you fish a real christian will manifest the fruits of the spirit regardless of the pressure they're put under all right that's right that's a mouthful even for a preacher you say you got something to back that up i do a man in the bar room one night got a bunch amongst a bunch of drunks but carlton he said these words he said i know a real christian they said there is no such thing he said oh yes there is he said it's my wife at home they said no no he said well come on home listen that man with a bunch of drunk friends had enough sense to know what a real christian was he said he walked in the house remember said he went in and sit down said there was his godly wife said he come in and said now watch guys and he said hey woman fix me some eggs she said yes dear she went over and got the eggs out started fixing them you know brought him over there set him down on the table real nice and said here you go dear here's your eggs he took that plate brother david and threw it in the floor he said you know i don't lock my eggs like that [Music] his buddy sitting there watching and bless god she drew her fist back said i'll tell you one thing man this is my house and my kitchen and you but under that pressure a christ-like character expressed itself she went over and knelt down and began to pick up the broken pieces and begin to sing the song must jesus bear the cross alone and all the world go free brother joe i found my plate myself in that woman's place you found yourself there brother men cut you beat your splashing treat you like dirt so do you square your shoulders back say bless god i'll show that preacher one thing no you humble yourself under who you are you stay in your position as god's desire and you pick up the broken pieces and you go preach another meeting you pick up the broken pieces and you play another song you pick up the broken pieces and you go to another youth are you hearing me you pick up the broken pieces cause it's your position brian stay in position

character there father because they've been placed there by the almighty god they're they're nursing from the rest of their shiny eye oh god where was that woman's strength coming from to stay in her position and to be a real witness it was coming from the rest of el shady i and father i'm asking you tonight oh god may you come down among us tonight lord may you reveal yourself to us oh god may

tuesday night meeting may you sweep through the building tonight god and may you give them a straight father to stay in their position as an oddball to stay in their position lord and not to bow their knee to a bunch of intimidating spirits from the pits of hell that's trying to remove them from their position because that devil knows if he can get a father out of his position he has now found an interest to that young girl if he can get a father out of his position he's now found interest to that young boy but i pray tonight oh god forever godly holy ghost filled father and mother may his strength come to him lord may grace come to him tonight god i pray for every young person lord as a young man as a young lady father in their teenage years oh god as they come to those stages of

tonight lord that you lead that young person to the rest of el shaddai tonight and may they nurse strength into their body oh god to remain in their position as a young man as a young lady as an obedient child father not a rebellious child not a stubborn child as an obedient child that will say oh god i don't understand why i'm having to do this i don't understand these convictions but oh god
