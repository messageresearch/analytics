[19:57] special
[19:58] for your spouse for your loved one on
[20:00] valentine's day i appreciate my wife
[20:02] very much and
[20:04] and uh over the years she's put up with
[20:06] a lot from me
[20:07] as far as being uh gone and
[20:11] and uh preaching and and putting the
[20:13] ministry first as you have to do to be a
[20:15] minister but i'm so grateful for my wife
[20:18] that stood by me through all of that and
[20:20] and
[20:21] uh hope she has a good day and and do
[20:23] something special for your wife today if
[20:24] you have a chance
[20:25] i'm going to be reading from philippians
[20:27] chapter 1 and verse 20.
[20:31] i want to thank you for your prayers for
[20:33] my grandmother
[20:34] uh passing away for the family uh that
[20:37] funeral will be next saturday
[20:39] uh in alberto springs missouri and i'll
[20:42] have to speak
[20:42] at that funeral so i won't be back on
[20:45] sunday brother
[20:46] brayden savage is actually going to come
[20:48] and and speak to us he did a wonderful
[20:50] job the last time he was here
[20:52] and so he's the lord willing he'll be
[20:54] back next sunday i don't know about
[20:56] wednesday night service yet we're
[20:57] supposed to have another round of
[20:58] weather coming in
[20:59] but we'll let you know if we can have
[21:01] church we'll have church
[21:02] and otherwise we'll let you know and but
[21:04] we want to take advantage of the
[21:06] opportunity that we have here
[21:08] amen and but about my my grandmother was
[21:11] a good woman and
[21:13] her and my grandfather the reason why
[21:16] we're in the message today and you know
[21:18] people
[21:20] can make many mistakes in their lives
[21:22] but at the same time
[21:24] if they weren't there you wouldn't be
[21:26] here and that
[21:27] was my grandmother and and she was a
[21:29] wonderful woman and when you see my
[21:31] mother then you see my grandmother the
[21:33] way my mom is and how she puts her
[21:34] family first that's the way my
[21:35] grandmother was
[21:37] and so we'll miss her but we believe
[21:39] there's a glad reunion day coming
[21:41] do you believe that today if we don't
[21:43] believe that i've thought a lot about
[21:45] that lately where paul says
[21:46] if in this life only i have hope i am of
[21:49] all men most miserable
[21:51] but there's a resurrection day coming
[21:53] there there's a day coming we're
[21:54] actually going to see
[21:55] he said brother ben how can you say that
[21:57] how can you prove that i know it
[21:59] it's an absolute in my life amen there's
[22:02] going to be
[22:03] a time we'll see our loved ones and this
[22:05] message makes that so real to us
[22:07] we thank god for that philippians 1 and
[22:09] 20
[22:11] according to my earnest expectation and
[22:13] my hope
[22:15] that in nothing i shall be ashamed but
[22:17] that with all boldness as
[22:19] always so now also christ shall be
[22:22] magnified in my body
[22:24] whether it be by life or by death
[22:28] for to me to live is christ and to die
[22:32] is gain
[22:33] amen what an absolute paul had for me to
[22:37] live is christ and to die is gain i pray
[22:39] the lord would add his blessing to the
[22:40] word you may be seated
[22:47] there's never been a more radical change
[22:49] in the life of a man than
[22:52] in the life of paul when he was
[22:55] saul the pharisee he persecuted the
[22:58] church with all the fervor that he had
[23:00] with all the
[23:01] uh all the integrity that he could
[23:04] summon he
[23:04] had zeal uh beyond what uh
[23:08] what you would even think is normal or
[23:10] natural to do that
[23:12] he was as uh as we would say he was as
[23:16] entrenched
[23:17] in that pharisaic interpretation of the
[23:20] scriptures
[23:20] as what you could be had been taught by
[23:22] the greatest teacher of that day
[23:24] gamaliel
[23:26] and yet when he met god one time
[23:30] one time he met god and when he did it
[23:32] all changed
[23:35] and i'll just tell you this morning that
[23:39] if you ever meet god and we can work
[23:41] with you and i i'd be glad to and
[23:43] and so many times we work with people we
[23:45] try to get them to a place where they
[23:46] understand and they believe this message
[23:48] but
[23:49] if you could ever meet christ if you
[23:52] could ever
[23:53] find out what he is to you and what he
[23:55] means to your life
[23:57] things would change you don't have to
[24:00] tell
[24:00] a person who's met christ that he has to
[24:03] do this and that and the other
[24:05] he'll see it in the word and when he
[24:06] sees it he'll come to it
[24:08] because he met christ and so we have to
[24:11] get people to christ
[24:13] and paul in the book of philippians
[24:16] his singular focus had become christ and
[24:19] his will for his life and
[24:21] it was written from his prison cell in
[24:24] rome
[24:25] and in philippians chapter three just to
[24:28] kind of give you an example of how he's
[24:29] writing
[24:31] and the focus of his life he warns the
[24:33] church to beware of those who would
[24:35] bring them back under the bondage
[24:37] of the law and then he says in verse 4
[24:40] he says though i might also have
[24:42] confidence in the flesh
[24:44] if any other man thinketh that he hath
[24:46] wherever he might trust in the flesh
[24:47] i'm more circumcised the eighth day of
[24:50] the stock of israel
[24:52] of the tribe of benjamin a hebrew of the
[24:53] hebrews as touching the law of pharisee
[24:57] which was the upper echelon it would be
[24:59] the
[25:00] he was what we would say a a
[25:02] fundamentalist a conservative
[25:05] he taught the law he believed the law he
[25:08] says
[25:09] but what things were gained to me
[25:12] amen those i counted loss
[25:16] for christ verse eight yeah he said
[25:19] dallas
[25:20] and i count all things but lost
[25:23] for the excellency of the knowledge of
[25:25] christ jesus my lord
[25:28] he said for whom i have suffered the
[25:30] loss of all things
[25:31] and to count them he says but dung they
[25:34] don't mean anything
[25:36] amen look at he uses graphic language to
[25:39] describe it
[25:40] it's nothing to me it doesn't mean
[25:43] anything to me
[25:44] i'm willing to put it all aside say i
[25:47] was completely wrong
[25:49] i lay it all down have you ever reached
[25:52] that place church
[25:53] i'm willing to whatever it was i'm
[25:55] willing to lay it down and turn around
[25:57] and say now
[25:58] in this moment on i have an absolute
[26:02] amen and so he says that i may win
[26:05] christ and i love these these next few
[26:08] verses it's just so touching
[26:11] he's writing this remember from a prison
[26:13] cell he says and be found in him
[26:16] not having mine own righteousness he
[26:18] said i'm willing to
[26:19] lay that all down all the things have
[26:21] been taught as a pharisee
[26:23] and be found in him not having minor own
[26:26] righteousness which is of the law
[26:27] but that which is through the faith of
[26:29] christ the righteousness which is
[26:32] of god by faith that i may know him
[26:36] that i may know him that's the most
[26:38] important you can meet me and forget me
[26:40] and
[26:40] you'd be all right but if you ever meet
[26:42] him that's the thing that i may know him
[26:45] and the power of his resurrection
[26:46] and the fellowship of his sufferings
[26:48] being made conformable unto his death
[26:51] he said if by any means i might attain
[26:53] unto the resurrection of the dead
[26:55] mother so i had already attained look at
[26:57] the lack of arrogance in this man
[26:59] he said either we're already perfect but
[27:01] i follow after
[27:02] look at his humility he says if that i
[27:04] may apprehend
[27:07] that for which also i am apprehended of
[27:10] christ jesus
[27:11] so he said god got a hold of me and now
[27:14] i'm grabbing a hold of him
[27:17] amen amen so now
[27:20] he says brethren i count not myself to
[27:22] have apprehended
[27:23] but this one thing i do forgetting those
[27:26] things which are behind
[27:28] forgetting those things which are behind
[27:30] that's what i used to be that's who i
[27:32] used to be
[27:33] that's what i used to do i don't do that
[27:35] anymore
[27:36] i'm forgetting those things which are
[27:37] behind and i'm pressing on
[27:39] i'm pressing reaching forth unto the
[27:42] those things which are before
[27:44] it uses the imagery of a runner reaching
[27:47] for the finish line
[27:48] every ounce every stream everything he's
[27:50] got to press to the finish line
[27:52] he said i press toward the mark for the
[27:54] price of the high calling of god in
[27:56] christ
[27:56] jesus i press for the mark
[28:01] that's a christ-centered life that's
[28:03] what brother branham calls it in the
[28:05] absolute a christ-centered
[28:07] life and he has such a christ-centered
[28:10] life that he wanted others to be like
[28:12] him
[28:13] in fact he stood before king agrippa and
[28:15] acts 26 27 he said king a griffith
[28:18] believeth saw the prophets
[28:19] i know that thou believeth and agrippa
[28:22] said unto paul almost now persuades me
[28:24] to be a christian
[28:26] the man evidently didn't even have a
[28:28] seed of god in him but yet paul's
[28:29] testimony was so
[28:31] sincere and so he was so persuasive that
[28:34] he said almost
[28:35] now persuades me to be a christian well
[28:38] i hope we haven't been almost persuaded
[28:40] but we've been fully persuaded
[28:43] he said almost have persuaded me to be a
[28:45] christian and paul said
[28:46] i would to god that not only thou but
[28:48] also all that hear me this day
[28:50] we're both almost and all together such
[28:53] as i
[28:54] am except these bonds you know paul
[28:58] paul will let you know what's going on
[29:00] in his life he talks about how he was
[29:01] shipwrecked he talked about how he was
[29:02] beaten
[29:03] he talked about those things but there's
[29:04] such joy in paul's writing
[29:06] because he's constantly saying i'm not
[29:08] even worthy of those things
[29:10] i just counted a privilege to you know
[29:12] if we
[29:13] if we talk more like that we might
[29:14] persuade more people
[29:17] it's such a joy to be a christian yes
[29:20] i've given up a lot but i've got so much
[29:22] more
[29:23] it's not even worthy to be compared the
[29:25] suffering of this present time
[29:27] not even worthy to be compared to the
[29:29] glory that'll be revealed in me one day
[29:32] amen and so and so he he talks with such
[29:35] joy in this christ-centered life he said
[29:38] i wish you were like me
[29:39] except for these bonds here you drag him
[29:42] up and change the criminal
[29:43] before king griffin he says i would that
[29:45] we could swap places i
[29:47] i would that you could be like me you'd
[29:48] be better off than being a king
[29:51] be a christian amen
[29:55] what produces that kind of
[29:56] christ-centered life
[29:58] well brother branham said he had a
[30:00] christ-centered call and an absolute he
[30:02] said paul
[30:04] at one two he said the one we're reading
[30:06] about he had a christ-centered call
[30:09] and that was his absolute
[30:12] he personally met christ
[30:15] and i know i'm saying that over and over
[30:17] again but i want us to really
[30:19] ponder that and really get it down
[30:20] because we fought
[30:22] sometimes in the message over what the
[30:24] absolute is and
[30:25] what it means but you have to meet
[30:28] christ
[30:30] you meet christ you won't struggle with
[30:33] the message of the hour
[30:35] if you really meet christ you won't
[30:37] struggle with the things you you may
[30:39] have struggles in the flesh sure
[30:41] but there'll be something inside of you
[30:42] that that's the truth
[30:45] right there's something inside of you
[30:46] that reaches out for that you don't have
[30:48] to be taught
[30:49] into that it's something you have what
[30:50] brother madam calls representation
[30:53] right representation there's just
[30:55] something that's right you know it's
[30:56] right
[30:58] and brother brown says the reason he had
[31:01] this christ in her life
[31:03] is because he personally he said now
[31:06] laying aside his teaching
[31:10] and that's many times what we have to do
[31:11] but when we meet christ
[31:14] is lay aside our teaching because
[31:17] and that becomes a hindrance sometimes
[31:18] to message people growing up in message
[31:20] fuse
[31:21] because we've been taught what to do and
[31:24] how to do it
[31:25] but laying aside his teaching and those
[31:27] things are good
[31:28] i think we should teach our children
[31:30] everything we can but laying aside his
[31:32] teaching
[31:32] he personally met christ
[31:37] he personally met christ amen
[31:41] and it is the rising of the sun brother
[31:42] brown said i'm afraid today that too
[31:44] many of us are not getting people to
[31:45] christ
[31:46] we're getting them to a church to a
[31:48] theory but we must get them to christ
[31:53] he's the only one that can change their
[31:54] lives i can't do it how many times
[31:56] have i sit back here and stood here in
[31:58] the pulpit and wish i could change
[31:59] someone's mind
[32:00] wish i could change someone's life i
[32:02] cried because i wish i could
[32:04] make it different for somebody but i
[32:06] can't do it
[32:08] i can't do it i can't make you do
[32:09] something it's not a forced religion
[32:13] but if you ever meet him
[32:16] if you could ever meet him where you
[32:18] would get people to a church we get them
[32:20] to a theory you should come to church
[32:21] you should believe the message but we
[32:23] must get them to christ
[32:26] he is the only one and the only one that
[32:28] has life
[32:29] he that has the son has life and brother
[32:32] brennan preached that multiple times in
[32:34] the message he that has the son
[32:35] it doesn't say he that has an lld or phd
[32:38] or anything else he that has a son
[32:40] has life amen
[32:44] and when you have this christ-centered
[32:46] life and you just listen fast with me
[32:48] today
[32:50] i looked at that clock and i'm thinking
[32:52] we started at 10 but we didn't
[32:55] but we'll just go through it just as
[32:57] quickly as we can and close
[32:58] but
[33:02] when you have a christ-centered life
[33:04] there are some characteristics of that
[33:08] there are some things that you do
[33:10] automatically
[33:12] see a christ-centered life is a changed
[33:14] life
[33:16] a changed life first peter 2 10 i won't
[33:19] read it to save time but it tells us
[33:20] we're a peculiar people
[33:23] a holy priesthood
[33:26] brother says now when you become like
[33:28] paul
[33:29] have the same absolute that he had a
[33:32] christ-centered life
[33:34] is a different life than what you once
[33:36] had huh
[33:38] a different life than what you once had
[33:41] he said and it might be a very religious
[33:43] life that you lived
[33:44] and i didn't get the rest of the quote
[33:46] but brother branham goes on to explain
[33:48] how that a religious life and a
[33:49] christ-centered life is two different
[33:51] things
[33:52] you can have a very religious life
[33:54] that's not christ centered
[33:57] right but a christ-centered life is
[33:58] something that the person of jesus
[34:00] christ
[34:01] lives out of you automatically
[34:05] right it does it's not something you
[34:06] make yourself do but it lives out of you
[34:10] now so it's a different than a religious
[34:12] life brother brother says when you get
[34:14] this christ-centered life
[34:16] it makes you do things you ordinarily
[34:18] wouldn't do
[34:20] right like come to church
[34:25] like treat your wife right
[34:29] it's valentine's day treat your husband
[34:30] right
[34:33] did you realize and i've said it before
[34:35] you can't say i love god and i hate my
[34:37] wife
[34:38] right you can't say i have a
[34:39] christ-centered life and i hate my wife
[34:42] or i hate my husband but there's a
[34:44] reason why the scripture says husbands
[34:46] love your wives
[34:47] never has to tell the wise that that's
[34:50] true
[34:51] and and but but see you have a christ in
[34:53] our life you don't have to be told to
[34:55] love
[34:56] because he is love brother branham tells
[34:58] us
[34:59] that he is that great attribute of god
[35:01] called love
[35:03] when you get this christ in life it
[35:05] makes you do things you
[35:06] ordinarily wouldn't do so just think
[35:09] about yourself about your dna about
[35:11] the way you're made up about who you are
[35:13] and everything about you there's just
[35:14] certain things that you do
[35:16] right i find myself sometimes standing
[35:18] in a certain way or
[35:20] walking in a certain way i was at a
[35:21] funeral here not long ago someone who
[35:23] knew my father
[35:24] come up to me and said someone told me
[35:26] you were here and i knew who you were
[35:28] because you look like your dad
[35:30] and you know that's to me you know it's
[35:32] not really a compliment
[35:34] for someone to tell me that and not
[35:36] putting down my dad but it's just but i
[35:38] do look like my dad
[35:40] but you know he was old
[35:45] but i look like he did when he was 50.
[35:48] that's not
[35:48] good but the the thing is
[35:52] the characteristics i catch myself
[35:55] driving like he did
[35:57] and he never taught me how to drive
[36:01] but but i watched him and just just
[36:04] become a part of him and i'm
[36:05] that have that same nature in the flesh
[36:07] but a christ-centered life
[36:09] makes you do things that you ordinarily
[36:12] wouldn't do
[36:13] it's not just that you keep being
[36:15] yourself
[36:16] say well i'm just me and nothing changes
[36:18] just the way i am no
[36:20] a christ-centered life makes you
[36:23] actually go against the grain in your
[36:24] own nature
[36:26] right until you actually do things and
[36:30] your wife will look at you and say man
[36:32] that's not like you
[36:34] your family look at you that's not like
[36:36] you
[36:37] everybody else in the family does this
[36:39] side of the other but you don't why are
[36:40] you different
[36:43] why are you different every one of us
[36:45] probably has a testimony something like
[36:47] that why are you different from others
[36:48] in your family
[36:49] because christ became the center of your
[36:51] life
[36:52] and that's the anchor that holds you
[36:54] there's something there that grabs a
[36:56] hold of you and keeps you there
[36:58] amen it's a christ-centered life makes
[37:01] you do things you ordinarily wouldn't do
[37:04] so brother branham again says now if you
[37:07] if in your life you have an absolute
[37:09] you do things ordinarily you would not
[37:10] do
[37:12] he said especially if you have a
[37:14] god-centered life
[37:16] he says again it makes you do things
[37:18] when you get a christ-centered life like
[37:19] paul had
[37:20] ordinarily you wouldn't do he said now
[37:23] look ordinarily that man trained in all
[37:24] the scriptures and things ordinarily
[37:26] he would have followed that line he was
[37:28] trained in right ordinarily he would
[37:30] have been whatever he was
[37:32] but he come to the message of the hour
[37:34] why why did he
[37:36] why because he met christ right and he'd
[37:39] become actually the messenger of that
[37:40] hour
[37:41] but it was christ that he met now he
[37:44] said
[37:45] when he become and made christ his
[37:46] absolute his ultimate
[37:48] then there was a different life he did
[37:50] different
[37:51] he done things crazy to what he once was
[37:54] trained to do
[37:56] he said and it'll do the same thing and
[37:59] brother baby says if the church would
[38:00] get away from that council of churches
[38:03] and come back and make god's word their
[38:05] ultimate make god's word their typos
[38:07] that would do it
[38:08] but they're trying to make he said
[38:10] they're tying
[38:12] to a man-made achievement
[38:15] their absolute is man-made and because
[38:18] it's man-made it's
[38:20] movable right
[38:23] that's why one day the denomination can
[38:25] teach against there was a time all
[38:27] pentecostal denominations taught just
[38:28] like we do on holiness
[38:31] every one of them did the assemblies of
[38:33] god in the 1950s
[38:34] the 60s some of you probably old enough
[38:36] to remember when holiness people were
[38:38] holiness
[38:40] and now they've all drifted away but god
[38:42] didn't change the bible didn't change
[38:45] huh what changed their absolute was the
[38:48] church
[38:50] right they're absolute was the council
[38:52] of churches and because their absolute
[38:54] was the church the council of churches
[38:55] the group of ministers whatever that it
[38:57] was or some pope somewhere
[38:59] what they change with that absolute but
[39:02] i'm so grateful today that we don't have
[39:03] an
[39:04] absolute that's a church we don't have
[39:06] an absolute trust in the arm of flesh
[39:08] or absolute it's christ the word and so
[39:11] it can't change because he doesn't
[39:13] change
[39:14] but brother brown says that
[39:15] denominational system he said it's bound
[39:17] to fall
[39:18] he said well the bible said they would
[39:19] do it he said but there's going to be a
[39:21] bride
[39:22] that's been elected since the foundation
[39:24] of the world that's going to be tied to
[39:26] that post
[39:28] very bad what a promise that is that we
[39:30] know there's going to be a bribe
[39:32] and it gives us such assurance and such
[39:34] clarity in our understanding
[39:36] it gives us it gives us the zeal to keep
[39:38] on preaching to keep on
[39:39] keeping on why because we know there's
[39:41] going to be a bribe there's somebody out
[39:43] there
[39:44] somebody in arkansas somebody out there
[39:46] that's going to believe
[39:48] and you don't even know why you believe
[39:49] but you just believe why because there's
[39:51] a bride that's been elected since the
[39:53] foundation of the world that's going to
[39:54] be tied to the thai post
[39:57] amen and so we can go a little further
[40:04] we find that a christ-centered life
[40:07] is a creative life
[40:10] my brother branham talks about this he
[40:13] says i'm talking about an absolute
[40:16] connected with christ he said then it
[40:19] makes you an odd person
[40:21] you do odd things praise the lord
[40:26] your thinking is altogether different
[40:29] now you're not just different to be
[40:30] different because brother brown talks
[40:31] about that he said
[40:32] you're a hypocrite if you're just
[40:35] different to be different you're a
[40:36] hypocrite
[40:37] we don't do that but whatever the word
[40:39] says that makes us different
[40:41] and the truth is the gap between the
[40:43] worldly church and the true church gets
[40:45] wider and wider as we get to the end
[40:47] time
[40:48] and we know that there will be there
[40:50] will be that sum that
[40:51] like judas that stick on the very end
[40:53] but for the most part it gets wider and
[40:55] wider why because the
[40:56] the church has gone so far from god
[40:58] keeps going farther we're getting closer
[41:00] to him
[41:01] we're going in different directions huh
[41:05] if you're going to mammoth springs and
[41:08] i'm going to ash flat we're going to get
[41:09] farther and farther from each other
[41:12] that church is going down we're going up
[41:16] amen so brother said it makes you an odd
[41:19] person you do odd things your thinking
[41:21] is altogether different than thinking he
[41:22] once did because you have found
[41:23] something
[41:24] that you've anchored a faith in someone
[41:26] that created
[41:28] the heavens and the earth you've
[41:30] anchored a faith in someone
[41:32] that created the heavens and he said
[41:35] that his very word itself
[41:37] is creative a god who spoke the world
[41:41] into existence
[41:43] there is nothing too hard for him now
[41:46] watch
[41:47] he said so it makes you creative
[41:50] yourself
[41:53] why not not the flesh but it makes you
[41:56] creative yourself because you take his
[41:58] words
[42:00] right remember i said absolutely we
[42:01] could say like that is what he said
[42:04] so when you take the absolute what god
[42:06] says whatever he says wherever he says
[42:08] it
[42:08] whoever he says it through that's your
[42:10] absolute
[42:11] what god says what are you you're a
[42:13] thought of god
[42:16] amen you're what god says
[42:21] you become creative yourself because you
[42:24] take his words and a word
[42:26] he said is a thought expressed so it
[42:29] makes
[42:30] you creative creative now if you talk
[42:33] about a creative person
[42:35] you know some people are not creative
[42:37] i'm not creative
[42:38] my kids can take plato and make
[42:40] something
[42:41] that resembles an object out of it i
[42:44] have never been able to do that when i
[42:48] take play-doh it
[42:49] is flat sound that's all i can do with
[42:53] it
[42:54] some people can paint i if i painted it
[42:58] look like modern art
[43:00] right i just throw a paint brush at it
[43:03] be done with
[43:04] but some people can paint they're
[43:06] creative they just have that in them
[43:09] but all of god's children are
[43:12] creative in a supernatural realm
[43:16] are you hearing me this morning all of
[43:18] god's children are creative
[43:20] we let this flesh get in the way but
[43:22] there's something inside of you a seed a
[43:24] word of god that
[43:25] is creative that it creates its own
[43:28] atmosphere
[43:30] brother branham uses it simply like and
[43:33] you know this valentine's day talks
[43:35] about how that you can create an
[43:37] atmosphere in your home
[43:39] just by doing things you ordinarily
[43:41] wouldn't do
[43:43] you say what's a christ-centered life
[43:44] sometimes a christ-centered life is
[43:45] putting an apron on
[43:47] boy that hurts me
[43:51] because i've told some of you in
[43:52] counseling and things that i we have
[43:54] very defined roles i mean my wife
[43:56] because of necessity it's just
[43:57] i've always went to work she's always
[43:59] stayed home took care of the kids i
[44:00] didn't ever wake up with the kids and
[44:02] and i've always been amused by the men's
[44:05] cry room because i never got to take my
[44:06] kids out in church not saying i wouldn't
[44:08] it's wonderful that you brothers do but
[44:09] i never got to do that
[44:11] but you know we have very very designed
[44:15] roles
[44:15] but when you have a christ-centered life
[44:17] sometimes it takes you out of what you
[44:18] would ordinarily do
[44:20] right because of love for that person
[44:23] and so brother brandon talks about
[44:24] saving an atmosphere in his home by
[44:25] putting on an apron and helping his wife
[44:27] with the dishes
[44:28] and beginning to speak words that would
[44:31] quieten her
[44:33] you can do that a woman can do that the
[44:36] words you
[44:37] you speak have power they mean something
[44:40] you just just throw them out there they
[44:41] mean something
[44:43] i have to watch remember jesus said
[44:45] every idle word that you speak
[44:47] you'll give a count thereof on the day
[44:48] of judgment
[44:50] that's pretty with some of us that like
[44:52] to talk a lot we got a lot more to be
[44:53] accountable for
[44:56] amen brother david
[44:59] but see paul brother branham said
[45:03] had got into this state
[45:06] to where he had not had a theological
[45:08] experience
[45:09] altogether but he had a personal witness
[45:12] he had met god and knew that he was
[45:15] called of god
[45:17] and nobody had to tell him anything
[45:18] about it he was
[45:20] absolutely sure that god still remained
[45:23] god
[45:25] amen he said if the world could just do
[45:28] that
[45:29] amen and if this group tonight if we
[45:32] could say
[45:33] this group this morning if this group
[45:36] this morning those watching and
[45:37] streaming
[45:37] those here and present with us if this
[45:39] group tonight sitting here could just
[45:41] remember
[45:42] that god is still god amen
[45:45] he's god in a snowstorm he's god in the
[45:48] in the in the middle of cove but he's
[45:49] the god in the middle of everything that
[45:51] you're going through in your life
[45:52] no matter how muddled up it is no matter
[45:53] how dark it seems he's god he's still
[45:56] god
[45:57] amen and he's able to answer in this
[45:59] case he says
[46:00] he's just as able to answer in this case
[46:03] as he is in a case of divine healing or
[46:05] anything else
[46:05] he's still god amen so whatever you have
[46:09] need of this morning
[46:10] he's still god he's still able to answer
[46:14] hallelujah amen
[46:17] he said if we can build our hopes not
[46:20] only our hopes but a positive thought
[46:23] that's a powerful thing a positive
[46:26] thought is a powerful thing we
[46:28] can build not only our hopes but a
[46:29] positive thought upon what he says
[46:33] amen and we know that it's the truth
[46:36] hallelujah he said and people act funny
[46:40] amen they seem to just forget about the
[46:43] negative side
[46:45] because they've found an absolute
[46:48] amen they seem to just forget about the
[46:50] negative side
[46:51] because they found an absolute because
[46:53] it's the word of god jesus said heavens
[46:55] and earth will pass
[46:56] away but my word shall never fail so if
[46:58] we've got the word of promise then
[46:59] there's no failing to it
[47:01] it cannot fail do we believe that today
[47:03] it cannot fail
[47:05] amen hallelujah it's a creative
[47:08] absolute a creative word a
[47:10] christ-centered life
[47:12] makes you a creative being what can that
[47:15] produce in you now
[47:17] brother branham in that absolute message
[47:19] he talks about wanted to be tarzan
[47:22] he said when he was little because he
[47:24] saw what tarzan could do
[47:27] i just pondered on that for a little bit
[47:29] i went back and listened to it again
[47:31] what could tarzan do so he said
[47:34] if i was tarzan i could swing through
[47:37] the
[47:37] jungle on a rope nothing could bother me
[47:41] nothing could catch up to me give me
[47:43] super strength i'd be tarzan
[47:46] i want to be like christ
[47:50] brother branham said i read those books
[47:51] i wanted to be like like uh the lone
[47:53] ranger i want to be like tarzan he said
[47:55] but one day i
[47:56] i read the real book he said i found i
[47:59] wanted to be like christ
[48:02] and we found that shakespeare if you had
[48:04] the life of shakespeare and your brother
[48:05] adam teaches us that in the message
[48:07] if you had the life of shakespeare in
[48:08] you you would do what shakespeare does
[48:11] you'd write plays right if you had the
[48:14] life of beethoven you'd write music
[48:17] if you had the life of john dillinger
[48:19] you'd rob banks
[48:21] and brother branham uses those
[48:22] illustrations over and over again
[48:25] and he says if the life of jesus christ
[48:27] lives in the person
[48:28] they become identified with him it's
[48:31] christ in you not a church member not a
[48:34] system
[48:35] but a resurrected power
[48:39] i've told you before we underestimate
[48:41] the value
[48:42] of the of the
[48:46] discernment that brother branham had and
[48:48] people say was just a gift no it was the
[48:50] sign of the son of man
[48:52] because what it was is he would see a
[48:54] vision and that would happen it hadn't
[48:56] happened since
[48:57] bible days in that manner
[49:00] because god was showing to the gentiles
[49:02] what he showed to the jews and
[49:04] samaritans
[49:05] brother branham brings that up over and
[49:06] over again what did it prove
[49:08] he said a wicked an adulterous
[49:10] generation seeks after a sign but they
[49:11] won't get one but the sign
[49:13] of the resurrection huh the sign of
[49:16] jonas
[49:17] amen it was it was in the belly of the
[49:19] well and come up it's the sign of the
[49:21] resurrection
[49:22] it proved amen that the resurrection
[49:25] that this was more than a church more
[49:27] than just a denominational system
[49:29] but the resurrected christ was among us
[49:33] right it proved that go back and listen
[49:35] to it they put they've colorized now
[49:37] deep cloths unto the deep it's on
[49:39] youtube
[49:39] you can go listen to it watch it and see
[49:43] what had happened what took place there
[49:45] it's important
[49:46] what took place it's at the end time
[49:49] god showed us he's still alive
[49:55] he said not a system but a resurrected
[49:57] power it's the holy ghost it's a token
[49:58] upon you
[49:59] that your life says amen to every
[50:01] scripture
[50:03] amen the promise is written in there he
[50:05] said and you are not yourself no more
[50:08] you are christ you don't think your
[50:09] thoughts he said you don't think your
[50:11] thoughts
[50:12] you say i think he said you have no
[50:13] thought coming
[50:15] that's hard on some of us thinkers isn't
[50:17] it
[50:20] he said you have no thought coming life
[50:22] that was in christ is in you
[50:24] the mind that was in christ is in you
[50:26] the works that was in christ is in you
[50:28] do we believe that today
[50:30] christ himself is in you he said you are
[50:33] dead your life is hidden god through
[50:35] christ sealed in there by the holy ghost
[50:37] you're not your own
[50:42] what does that life produce
[50:45] well in him and i won't hold you much
[50:46] longer but in him it produced a holy
[50:49] life
[50:52] a holy life in fact the bible says
[50:56] that even here and too were you called
[50:57] because christ has also suffered for us
[50:59] leaving us an example
[51:00] that you should follow his steps who did
[51:02] know sin
[51:05] neither was gal found in his mouth we
[51:08] believe in
[51:10] a life that a christ-centered life is
[51:12] one that can give you victory over
[51:13] temptation
[51:14] in mark 1-13 jesus was in the wilderness
[51:17] 40 days tempted of satan
[51:18] but he didn't sin once
[51:22] he said it was with the wild beasts and
[51:23] the angels ministered unto him but he
[51:24] did no sin
[51:26] hey man he said well i just can't help
[51:29] it
[51:30] of being overcome by temptation you can
[51:31] with a christ-centered life
[51:33] it doesn't mean that you'll be perfect
[51:34] because you're still in the flesh but
[51:36] you understand
[51:36] the man inside does not sin he can do no
[51:40] sin
[51:41] amen if you yield yourself to that he
[51:44] can keep you from every sin
[51:47] as you yield yourself to him now so he
[51:49] had victory over temptation
[51:51] a christ in her life there was virtue
[51:53] that's strength
[51:55] strength for somebody else you're not
[51:58] living for yourself
[51:59] anymore strength for somebody else
[52:03] brother brown said that was eternal life
[52:05] by the way
[52:06] was living for others a christ in her
[52:09] life gives you strength
[52:10] for someone else in in
[52:14] luke 6 19 it says the whole multitude
[52:16] sought to touch him
[52:17] there went virtue out of him and healed
[52:19] them all strength
[52:21] strength went out some of you provide
[52:25] provided strength to me and my family in
[52:28] different ways you can do that in
[52:30] in natural ways in spiritual ways you
[52:32] provide strength
[52:34] by something you say that's the nature
[52:36] of a christ-centered life is strength
[52:39] a christ-centered life doesn't drag
[52:40] people down
[52:42] right it provides strength to others
[52:46] excuse me a christ-centered life is not
[52:48] constantly concerned
[52:50] with what people think about or are not
[52:52] constantly concerned
[52:54] constantly dwelling on themselves
[52:57] or on some grudge that they've been
[53:00] holding
[53:00] but a christ-centered life provides
[53:02] strength to other people
[53:04] amen i want to be like that don't you
[53:07] don't you want that kind of a life
[53:08] well if you've met him that life is in
[53:10] you you just have to yield yourself to
[53:12] it
[53:14] amen that christ said her life was
[53:16] authority over nature
[53:18] in mark chapter 4 verse 39 he rose and
[53:20] rebuked the wind
[53:22] and said as the sea peace be still and
[53:23] the wind ceased there was a great calm
[53:26] don't you know that the same god that
[53:28] calmed the winds is able to calm the
[53:30] storms of our life
[53:31] he's able to conquer the earth it's one
[53:34] thing to speak a world into existence
[53:35] and go live on it it's another thing to
[53:37] speak in earth right here
[53:38] into the place where it ought to be
[53:40] that's the earth i want to speak to
[53:42] today
[53:42] with a christ-centered life you too can
[53:45] have that in your life
[53:46] there can be peace and it won't it won't
[53:49] be dependent on what everybody else says
[53:51] or does
[53:52] but peace a christ-centered life he
[53:54] wasn't dependent on how much faith the
[53:56] disciples had
[53:57] but he said peace be still
[54:00] and the waves ceased even though they
[54:03] doubted
[54:05] why he was god in flesh
[54:08] he was the absolute for that day but i'm
[54:10] going to get somewhere in a moment
[54:12] i want to show you something because
[54:15] this christ in her life can produce that
[54:17] same life in you look
[54:19] what does it produce forgiveness luke 23
[54:21] 34.
[54:23] jesus on the cross
[54:28] we could just dwell on that for a while
[54:32] father forgive them
[54:36] he didn't they didn't just speak bad
[54:38] about him on facebook
[54:42] they didn't just
[54:46] oh it's valentine's day but what love
[54:49] he had for us they didn't just run him
[54:52] down to their friends
[54:54] they didn't just talk about him yes they
[54:56] did all that they slandered him
[54:58] but they didn't just do that they nailed
[55:00] his hands and his feet
[55:01] across we did that the human race
[55:05] represented
[55:06] that it wasn't just the romans of the
[55:07] jews we did that
[55:11] nailed him to a cross and spit on him
[55:14] and put stripes on his back and and
[55:17] he stared dying in such pain
[55:20] he said father forgive them amen
[55:24] for they know not what they do
[55:28] even so callous that they gambled over
[55:30] his clothes
[55:32] to fulfill the scriptures don't you
[55:35] realize that
[55:36] if that same spirit lives in you
[55:39] you'll forgive the same way
[55:44] you have to jesus said if you stand
[55:46] praying when you stand praying forgive
[55:48] he said if you don't forgive other men
[55:50] of their trespasses you won't be
[55:52] forgiven
[55:52] that's a scary thought i don't want to
[55:55] not be forgiven
[55:57] so i'll forgive if i hold
[56:01] brother branham told multiple people he
[56:03] told the perry green and i
[56:04] i think he says something similar on
[56:06] tape but he said if you have one scratch
[56:08] of ought
[56:09] in your heart one scratch of art in your
[56:12] heart
[56:12] he said it'll keep you from heaven you
[56:15] can't go to that place that he's that he
[56:17] went to
[56:17] beyond the curtain of time if you have
[56:19] one scratch of all in your heart we've
[56:20] got to get to a place
[56:22] where we can say father forgive them
[56:24] they don't know what they did he did not
[56:26] attribute it to their
[56:27] to their malicious thinking though they
[56:29] probably had that he did not attribute
[56:31] it and say how awful they were
[56:32] he said father forgive them they don't
[56:35] know what they do
[56:37] amen
[56:40] then the jews laughed at his own people
[56:42] mocked him and spit on
[56:44] him and then 2 000 years later
[56:47] he's bringing the gospel back to him
[56:51] you know the gospel goes back to the
[56:52] jews after he leaves us
[56:55] it's going back to them with two
[56:57] prophets he's going to prove himself to
[56:58] 144 000 jews
[57:00] even though they were the ones who did
[57:02] that he's still going to
[57:04] give him such forgiveness amen i've
[57:07] always thought of that you know god's
[57:08] justice lasts
[57:09] for a long time but his forgiveness is
[57:12] forever
[57:14] and you look at his judgment and his
[57:15] justice how he kept the two tribes
[57:17] you know the story and brother brown
[57:19] talks about in the seventh field there's
[57:20] two tribes
[57:21] that are not represented there in that
[57:22] hundred forty four thousand but he said
[57:24] then over in the millennium
[57:25] or over in the in the new heavens and
[57:27] earth earth they're back again
[57:30] amen god being so gracious that he will
[57:34] not blot their name out forever
[57:36] aren't you so grateful for god like that
[57:39] provides
[57:39] mercy to generations that don't deserve
[57:41] it
[57:43] that's the way we should be what does
[57:45] this provide this gives me such great
[57:47] hope
[57:50] this christ-centered life is a life of
[57:52] resurrection
[57:54] the scripture says if the spirit of him
[57:56] that raised up jesus from the dead dwell
[57:57] in you
[57:58] he that raised up christ from the dead
[58:00] shall also
[58:01] quicken make alive your mortal bodies
[58:05] such great symbolism of the joe when you
[58:07] lay someone in the grave
[58:08] and their their body their body is dead
[58:11] and you know it you've touched it you
[58:12] you know it's dead you've seen it it's
[58:15] dead
[58:17] it's not but you lay it away why because
[58:20] in hope
[58:21] of a resurrection and i know god can
[58:24] gather it from the four winds of the
[58:25] earth or whatever it is
[58:26] it may be a new body whatever i'm not
[58:28] going to get into the theology of that
[58:30] but you understand there's such great
[58:32] symbolism you lay it away and there's
[58:33] hope in your heart
[58:34] i know i'm going to see them again why
[58:37] because
[58:38] they're not in that body that's not the
[58:40] person but god's even going to raise up
[58:41] that mortal body
[58:43] it also quicken your mortal bodies by
[58:45] the spirit that dwells in you but he
[58:46] doesn't wait until the resurrection to
[58:47] quicken your mortal bodies
[58:49] he does that in the new birth it makes
[58:51] you alive gives you quickening power
[58:53] amen
[58:55] to live a christ-centered life amen
[58:59] listen to this brother said i can see
[59:01] eternity break come down into time since
[59:03] eden
[59:04] when it did there come a line of blood
[59:06] all the way up into calvary
[59:07] i promise i did away with most of my
[59:09] notes this morning but
[59:10] you just forgive me he said i see
[59:13] eternity break come down at a time
[59:15] when it did there come a line of blood
[59:17] all the way up into calvary and from
[59:18] calvary tied with this line
[59:20] goes on to the typos jesus and someday
[59:24] amen when he comes to claim his own
[59:27] everyone that's tied to that ultimate
[59:29] listen to that simple language that
[59:31] brother brown uses for the line
[59:33] of blood that goes down through history
[59:35] and here's a tie post
[59:37] and everything tied to it amen
[59:40] we'll be raised up into eternity amen
[59:44] someday says when he comes
[59:45] to claim his own everyone that's tied to
[59:47] that ultimate will be raised up into
[59:49] eternity
[59:51] why they had been in eternity all the
[59:52] time listen
[59:55] i got to reread that they have been in
[59:57] eternity all the time
[1:00:01] hallelujah you didn't get eternal life
[1:00:03] when you were saved
[1:00:07] that's the eternal means eternal
[1:00:10] never had a beginning never had an end
[1:00:12] god knew you before the foundation of
[1:00:14] the world
[1:00:15] he said they've been in eternity all the
[1:00:16] time they were predestinated in eternity
[1:00:21] you realize i was studying one time
[1:00:22] years ago and i found out the decisions
[1:00:25] made in eternity can't be changed
[1:00:27] there's no time to change them
[1:00:30] that's kind of a play on words but
[1:00:31] there's not you know the devil fell
[1:00:34] before time there's no time to change it
[1:00:39] think about that he is who he is the
[1:00:41] angels have failed they are who they are
[1:00:43] but time is given for redemptive
[1:00:44] purposes
[1:00:47] but we've been in eternity all the time
[1:00:50] hallelujah they were predestined an
[1:00:52] eternity they're part of god
[1:00:54] they were in his thinking at the
[1:00:55] beginning hallelujah
[1:00:57] that can't change oh sure there will be
[1:00:59] those whosoever will that will come and
[1:01:01] plead to the cross of christ but to the
[1:01:02] elected
[1:01:04] amen to the elected they were
[1:01:07] predestined from eternity
[1:01:08] and when that big rope is pulled of the
[1:01:10] line of blood he said that token i was
[1:01:12] speaking of
[1:01:13] when it comes up from the earth every
[1:01:15] one that was included in that blood
[1:01:17] will be dropped right up into eternity
[1:01:19] again
[1:01:20] hallelujah it somehow makes sense
[1:01:22] brother bram says it dropped right up
[1:01:24] into eternity i don't even know how that
[1:01:25] works but it makes sense
[1:01:28] amen but the only way it'll be will be
[1:01:31] tied to that absolute jesus christ
[1:01:34] he said it's absolute not an achievement
[1:01:37] of man
[1:01:39] well so-and-so did this my my mother my
[1:01:43] father my pastor
[1:01:44] some other great man they did this but
[1:01:46] it's not tied to an achievement of man
[1:01:48] but god raised him up from the dead and
[1:01:51] he is an absolute
[1:01:54] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:01:58] amen lost my place but we're about to
[1:02:02] close anyway
[1:02:03] he said we know he's alive amen because
[1:02:06] he's here with us
[1:02:07] in the power of his resurrection doing
[1:02:10] the same thing he did when he was here
[1:02:11] on earth
[1:02:12] he said i'm tied to that ultimate that's
[1:02:14] the end of all strife i'm tied to it
[1:02:16] that's my life i was a sinner when
[1:02:18] christ saved me i meant something and
[1:02:20] since that came into me it's been
[1:02:21] different
[1:02:22] and i'm tied to it everything that i am
[1:02:24] it's tied right there amen
[1:02:26] and then god's separating his life let
[1:02:29] me live in him and him and me
[1:02:30] then we're tied he said it don't make
[1:02:32] any difference what others want to
[1:02:34] believe
[1:02:34] to the individual you are tied to that
[1:02:36] and brother branham passed his bible
[1:02:38] he said that's your ultimate that's the
[1:02:40] last word and then if he is the word
[1:02:43] then this must be the last word
[1:02:46] this must settle it whatever that says
[1:02:48] he said that's that scarlet thread that
[1:02:50] is christ
[1:02:51] and anything contrary to that i know
[1:02:53] nothing about it
[1:02:54] he said that's what we want to know is
[1:02:56] what this word says
[1:02:57] i am tied to christ and christ is the
[1:02:59] word he said you get it now look
[1:03:02] so this is the ultimate and if you have
[1:03:05] to acknowledge the word is true
[1:03:07] whether you understand it or not whether
[1:03:09] you can make it tie in with everything
[1:03:11] you say well i can't get this quote to
[1:03:12] tie with the scripture but you
[1:03:13] acknowledge
[1:03:14] that the word is true and then you take
[1:03:18] it and filter it through that
[1:03:19] you have to acknowledge the bible that's
[1:03:21] true whether you can live it or not
[1:03:25] if you can acknowledge it's true you've
[1:03:26] got some place to start
[1:03:29] right because you can say lord help my
[1:03:30] unbelief
[1:03:32] right but if you can't acknowledge it
[1:03:34] it's true you've got nowhere to go
[1:03:36] you've got to acknowledge it he said
[1:03:37] that's what we want to know what this
[1:03:39] word says for i'm tied to christ in
[1:03:40] christ is the word
[1:03:42] amen he said on the portion of his word
[1:03:45] now watch this closely before we close
[1:03:49] i said it three times it's going to
[1:03:50] happen now
[1:03:52] the portion of his word that's lauded
[1:03:55] for this day
[1:03:57] his holy spirit is here to manifest
[1:04:00] that portion of word amen
[1:04:04] and he goes back to jesus he said just
[1:04:05] like it was back there at his birth
[1:04:07] isaiah 9
[1:04:07] 6 all down to the scriptures everything
[1:04:10] was spoken of him
[1:04:12] it was fulfilled over in the book of
[1:04:13] luke we see it that
[1:04:15] he said and he was the end he was the
[1:04:17] end of the prophecy too
[1:04:19] of him he fulfilled that the history the
[1:04:22] songs
[1:04:23] everything in the old testament that
[1:04:24] spoke of him it was fulfilled right
[1:04:26] there
[1:04:27] he said that become the ultimate that
[1:04:29] become the typos of the word of god for
[1:04:31] that age
[1:04:33] and the real listen to this
[1:04:36] born-again people of this age that's
[1:04:39] filled with the holy ghost
[1:04:41] is the thai post
[1:04:46] people argue about what the absolute is
[1:04:49] and they ask
[1:04:50] where's the welsh revival it's right
[1:04:52] here now remember i told you flesh can't
[1:04:54] be the absolute
[1:04:56] no flesh is the absolute right but
[1:04:59] the absolute dwells in you so you can
[1:05:00] say you're not the absolute but the
[1:05:01] absolute
[1:05:02] is in you you have the absolute
[1:05:05] and to the people of this age you are
[1:05:07] the absolute
[1:05:09] you're the typos of that scripture that
[1:05:12] makes it real
[1:05:14] are you with me now it could be
[1:05:16] interpreted in different ways
[1:05:18] but when it lives through david then
[1:05:20] it's real
[1:05:22] amen and that becomes an absolute the
[1:05:24] revealed word
[1:05:25] it's like the review booth it's the
[1:05:27] absolute amen
[1:05:30] he said in the real world again people
[1:05:31] this age is filled with the holy ghost
[1:05:32] is the typos of this scripture
[1:05:34] that's got to be fulfilled in these last
[1:05:36] days
[1:05:37] amen they are the ultimate
[1:05:42] church everything that god said is going
[1:05:44] to be wrapped up in us
[1:05:47] jesus said in the volume of the book it
[1:05:49] was written to me and we could say the
[1:05:50] same thing
[1:05:50] because there's parts of the book that
[1:05:52] were written about each age but in the
[1:05:53] volume of the book it's written about
[1:05:54] the end time bride
[1:05:56] you understand everything was written
[1:05:57] it's written about us
[1:05:59] and i don't say that to be cocky it's
[1:06:00] the truth it gives us a lot to live up
[1:06:03] to
[1:06:04] they are the ultimate it's god's
[1:06:05] ultimate because it's his word
[1:06:07] and the word is christ the typos there's
[1:06:10] no way to get away from it
[1:06:12] amen something that holds you
[1:06:16] see you can't you say well i'll get
[1:06:18] discouraged and leave the message not if
[1:06:19] you have
[1:06:20] not if you are the ultimate
[1:06:24] how can you it's not two different
[1:06:26] things
[1:06:27] you and the message is not different you
[1:06:30] and the end time word is not different
[1:06:31] you and the bride is not at two
[1:06:32] different things you don't live one life
[1:06:34] out here
[1:06:35] one life here one life in the world one
[1:06:37] life at church one life at home or life
[1:06:39] in the pulpit you don't do that
[1:06:40] why because you are the ultimate
[1:06:44] the life that you live is by the grace
[1:06:46] of god as paul said
[1:06:48] now your flesh may fail many times but
[1:06:50] there's something on the inside
[1:06:52] that becomes the typos to god's word for
[1:06:54] this day
[1:06:55] does that make sense it's god's ultimate
[1:06:58] because it's his word and the word is
[1:06:59] christ the typos there's no way to get
[1:07:01] away from it
[1:07:02] it's something that holds you amen
[1:07:05] amen something keeps holding me are you
[1:07:07] glad it does
[1:07:09] not just the preacher either
[1:07:13] some of you will get that in a minute
[1:07:16] they are the ultimate he says could we
[1:07:19] say that anymore plainly
[1:07:21] it's god's ultimate because it's his
[1:07:23] word and the word is christ it's
[1:07:24] something that holds you
[1:07:27] musicians go ahead and come
[1:07:36] there brother brown tells the story in
[1:07:38] the absolute sermon in
[1:07:40] december of 1962 about a man that went
[1:07:43] to war
[1:07:45] the man was got in the middle of a
[1:07:48] battle and the shells were flying
[1:07:50] he had a good friend that was a catholic
[1:07:52] and he wasn't religious this man but he
[1:07:55] had been around these catholics and
[1:07:57] the catholics said man said well what
[1:07:59] did you do
[1:08:00] he said well he said i reached down he
[1:08:03] said and i
[1:08:04] i saw some blood and he said and then i
[1:08:05] realized it was my blood
[1:08:07] it got real on the battlefield
[1:08:11] gets real sometimes on the battlefield
[1:08:12] of life
[1:08:14] it got real i realized that was my blood
[1:08:19] and the man said well did you
[1:08:22] do your rosary did you say a prayer to
[1:08:24] mary
[1:08:27] and the man said i didn't know what else
[1:08:29] to say he said he
[1:08:30] he said no he said when i realized that
[1:08:32] was my blood
[1:08:34] he said i didn't want to talk to a
[1:08:36] secretary
[1:08:38] i want to talk to the main man
[1:08:42] god help us today there's got to be an
[1:08:45] ultimate
[1:08:46] he said and that's it brother when a man
[1:08:48] comes to christ you don't want to take
[1:08:49] some preacher's word
[1:08:51] that's your blood that's your life
[1:08:54] there's got to be something real not
[1:08:55] just a preacher's word
[1:08:56] some secretary's word some something
[1:08:58] else he said you protestants don't take
[1:09:00] this side or the other
[1:09:02] go to that absolute until you're
[1:09:05] anchored there by the new birth
[1:09:07] being born again and filled with the
[1:09:09] holy ghost and you see the bible being
[1:09:11] manifested in humility and love
[1:09:13] through your life he said then that's
[1:09:15] your absolute
[1:09:16] amen do you believe that today we'll
[1:09:19] close heavenly
