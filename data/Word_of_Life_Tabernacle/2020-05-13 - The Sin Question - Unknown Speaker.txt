tonight so don't be worried I mean we shouldn't be worried with time anyways amen I'd like to preach tonight if we could just for a few moments on the sin question and I've been on this some of you been here I've preached to the last couple times just on the atonement just you know one God lay something on your heart just seems like you can't get away from it sometimes and so just pray it's a blessing tonight if we would let's just read that numbers chapter 21 and verse 4 and then we will bow our heads for word of Prayer and they journeyed from mount hor by the way of the Red Sea to compass the land of Edom and the soul of the people was much discouraged because of the way if we could just bow our heads if you have maybe an unspoken request or something it's on your heart you'd like God to speak to you tonight I won't you just make that known by the lifting of your hand Lord we just come before you this evening Lord just with the great expectation just to hear from you god I pray you just move me aside and come and speak to your children Lord just once again god I pray that if there's if there's anything that's in the way to not god I pray you just remove that tonight Lord and just let your spirit come and have free will here tonight with your people or if there be any sick among us or listening in God I pray while the word goes forth that your healing power would go with it pray just bless the words bless the the people that have come out tonight to they've set aside this time to come in here from you I pray you just bless them as well in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen you can have your seats tonight I'll read their numbers chapter 21 and verse 4 again and we'll read down to verse 9 and they journeyed from Mount hor by the way of the Red Sea to compass the land of Edom and the soul of the people was much discouraged because of the way and the people will begin to speak against God and against Moses wherefore have you brought us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness for there is no bread neither is there any water our soul loathe this light bread and and the Lord sent fiery serpents among the people and they bit the people and much people of Israel died and therefore the people who came to Moses and said we have sinned for we have spoken against the Lord and against the prey unto the Lord that he take away the Serpent's from us and Moses prayed for the people and the Lord said unto Moses make the a fiery Serpent and set it upon a pole and it shall come to pass that every one that has bitten when he looketh upon it shall live and Moses made a serpent of brass and put it on a pole and it came to pass that if a serpent had bitten any man when he beheld the serpent of brass he lived and so you know many times reading through the the scripture here and many times reading through through the Bible you look at the children of Israel and you just you kind of get sick of it you're like well lady they serve God and then they go back and they serve God and they go back and they do this and they go back and they do this and they go back and we see many times they do this and then we kind of look at our own life and we say you know it's kind of like it's kind of like me you know I kind of forget what God did for me in the past and forget this and forget that and I come back to another mountain and I get so I get tired again I get get exhausted I get down again and we become discouraged because of the way and I want you to know that people begin to speak against God and against Moses and says wherefore have you brought us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness for there's no bread neither is there any water and our soul oh that's a slight bread and we know that that God had sent man amongst the people and they begin to reject that word that that life that he was sending to him and they begin to become discouraged and so we see that God had to send fiery serpents among the people and I wanted to look this this evening if we could just to look at the atonement and what all was within that atonement and brother Branham said the brass serpent had a compound meaning it meant the healing and removal of sin and so we see that whenever there's you know when we look at the brass serpent it wasn't only that they would be healed and lived but it was the removal of sin as well and so I really want to focus on that tonight brother Branham says he says and out of a very beautiful parable what was it lifted up for the brazen serpent he said for healing it was a compound reason when they needed Hill and they lifted up the brass serpent what was it it was because they were murmuring and chattering against God and Moses and it was for a compound reason that they were murmuring in sinan and they were sick and he did heal and he said and my as Jesus said as Moses lifted up the brass serpent in the wilderness just for the same purpose the same cause the same atonement so must the Son of Man be lifted up it's a compound reason to save your soul so we see that Christ he didn't die on the cross just for the healing it wasn't just for the stripes that he bore but it was for salvation of our soul is that correct there was more that was in the atonement than just the repair or just the repentance of sins it was a new life in the atonement and the smitten rock that brought forth water that gushed out into the land to save a perishing people God so loved the world in his knew he said in the New Testament the type or the anti-type rather God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son that whosoever shall believeth him should not perish but have everlasting life he said there you are and that's what was perishing and dying and helpless people that the brass serpent was lifted up and the smitten Rock was smitten was to give forth life and healing and peace to those people he said so God lifted up his son that you would not perish but have everlasting life he says my brother my sister I pray you'll accept him tonight so we see that Christ was lifted up that you and I might take on the new life of Christ as that right so within the atonement you we have healing we have salvation there's so much that lays within the atonement it's the removal of sin if you will accept that atonement amen and that was the part that was on the people they didn't have to do anything else but look and live is that right so we see tonight it's not about what you've done or what you've been or where you're going it's about if you can look at that you have that right as a Christian as a human being to look at that and live tonight amen so we see that God he took all the responsibility he took all the all all the debt are all the things upon him and let us have the reward is that right brother branham says the Christ is the inexhaustible fountain of life we are planted in him by the Holy Spirit he said and then all we have to do is drink from him amen do you love the Lord this evening so we see there is in John chapter 3 and verse 1 and I'll just kind of work my way into this and and if you if you've ever heard me preach I just start going and keep going as fast as I can so I pray you can keep up I've tried to slow down but it just doesn't work for me so and even just take notes as fast as you can or just hang on for the ride a man there was a man in the pharisees named nicodemus a ruler of the jews and the same came to jesus by night and said unto him rabbi we know that thou are a teacher come from God for no man can do these miracles that thou doest except God be with him jesus answered and said to him verily verily I say unto you except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of God and Nicodemus said saith unto Him how can a man be born when he is old can he enter a second time into his mother's womb and be born so this see this question was presented of Jesus and brother branham says and who is God and nineteen fifty says o the brass serpent couldn't pray for nobody couldn't the brass serpent didn't he said what did they do the brass serpent you believe that was God's gift to Israel right he said they looked and lived the angel in the pool in the water Bethesda didn't pray for nobody they stepped in the water and was healed is that right God is the only way that you can be healed tonight if you look at that and you read into that it's all about the faith if you look at something and believe it God will make it come to pass a man but if you look at the Word of God you don't have faith in it then nothing fruitful will come of that is that right amen I believe you know it's like I believe brother Bren was speaking on it you know you just write the check if you begin to look and say well there's nothing in the bank account I don't want but I don't believe when I write this check it's gonna be it's gonna be payable I just don't believe it then guess what that check is not going to be payable but if you look at it and live and believe with your heart it will be cashed amen so we see in verse five down on in John chapter three jesus answered and said verily verily I say unto you except a man be born of water and of spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom of God he said that which is born of the flesh is flesh and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit malvert Marvel not that I saying to you you must be born again the wind bloweth where it listeth and thou hearest the sound thereof but cannot tell whence it cometh or whether it goeth so is every one that is born of the Spirit Nicodemus answered and said to him how can these things be and jesus answered and said unto Him art thou a master in Israel and knowest not these things he said verily verily I say unto you we speak that we do know and testify that we have seen and he received not our witness if I had told you earthly and you believe not how shall you believe if I tell you of heavenly things no man hath ascended up to heaven but he that come down from heaven even the Son of Man which is in heaven and as Moses lifted up the serpent in the serpent in the wilderness even so must the Son of Man be lifted up that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have eternal life for God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life and so just to kind of lay a foundation there and just kind of go back over over that but we see in our own personal life and you know I used my family a lot and in my examples but you know there's one time I took Matney and I brought him up here and I didn't tell him what I was gonna do I didn't tell him I just set him up on the pulpit and I turned him around I'm like fall back and he just immediately fell back and I caught him why he had faith that I was going to catch him is that right and I believe as Christians when we look into the Word of God if we have faith and we look into the Word of God and it says we can be healed or we can have the things that we desire if you have faith it will be given unto you is that right the Bible says if you have the faith of the grain of a mustard seed anything that you ask shall be given unto you and I believe as Christians that's the way it ought to be in our lives if we ask God for something just because we don't get it the next day or the next day we ought to believe even more the next day that it's gonna come around the next corner amen you know when we when we ask God for something we he's not an errand boy that he would go and fetch it for us immediately I know brother Branham says God wants to give it to you more than you want it and I think it's hard for us to fathom that sometimes but if we could just look into the Word of God and say this is my right as a Christian if I ask anything in the name of the Father he will give it to me then we as Christians ought to believe that once we ask that it's coming it's on its way amen if you call somebody and you say hey do this for me would you mail this for me would you get this for me that takes faith to believe that person's gonna do it amen I don't call Matney and be like hey could you go in and start the oven and cook supper because I know he wouldn't know what to do but I know when my wife calls me or I call her to start the oven we know how to handle that and I can promise you tonight there's nothing you can ask God that he don't know how to handle amen if you can just come to him and believe that it will come to pass and it's God's will for it to come to pass in your life then it shall come to pass a man and that's the thing we have to remember as people just because we want it doesn't mean it's right for us is that right you know I heard a man say one time at a convention you know and I think I've heard it many other times but you know many people want more money and he said you know if you're not faithful with a hundred what would make you faithful with a million if you can't handle a hundred you can't handle a mean so if you can't have faith to cure a headache why are you trying to stop storms and move mountains and things you've got to start off and build your faith is that right if you have faith to believe it it shall come to pass but and brother Branham says he said the serpent represented sin already judged God judged the serpent in the Garden of Eden in the third chapter of Genesis in the fourteenth verse God already passed judgment upon the sir but he said oh he was beautiful walked upright he was the most subtle bita beast of the field but God judged him and put him down on his belly the rest of his days and he says he was judged and Christ was our sins judge he says amen do you see it beautiful my sin your sins justly we should go to hell and be punished for our sins but Christ took our place he said the serpent he said that's why it represented Christ the brass serpent being made out of brass meant divine judgment he said now the serpent was sin already judged and he said the brass meant divine judgment so it was divine judgment on our sin already being judged and and that's the great thing tonight that you and I have is as Christians our sin is no longer attached to you and I as that right everything that you and I had done or had failed or had - had fallen or what anything that was in our past God took it and judged it upon Christ is that right and the ultimate sacrifice was paid then that you and I could go free amen that's why we don't do we don't do bulls and goats he was the ultimate sacrifice that entered once into into the Holy of Holies that he would be our sacrifice for ever and ever is that right Hebrews 12 and 6 verse says for whom the Lord loveth he chased Mithen scourgeth every son whom he receiveth if he endured the chastening God dealeth with you as sons for what son is he whom the father chasing if not and I believe as people we like everything easy we live in a microwave age is that right you know we don't want we want to go to a restaurant and have our food ready by the time we get there we haven't even ordered yet but we want our food ready is that right and we see many times in life you know my kids don't understand what you know what what I had to wait on and I don't understand what my parents had to wait on what my grandparents had to wait on you know we grow up and we see different things and I look at the things my kids not gonna see that I ever did you know I didn't have a cell phone at this age I didn't have access they didn't have I phones you know when I was younger now it's just all smartphone technology and and you know we we don't know what we did before we had phones is that right we were disconnected so to speak but it seems to be that everybody was fine before it got here but now if we leave we we don't know what to do is that right you know my phone died last night like it's 6 o'clock and I didn't have it till this morning at 8 it was great I was disconnected but nobody could get ahold of me nobody you know there was no way there was no way to connect to me and and I believe in this age we've kind of grown to where everything is instant it's an instant age instant mashed potatoes instant everything and and as Christians that's not all the way that God's time is not our time is that right you know you know if we ask God for something we expect it to be done right then and if any of you work in customer service with people when they call you they want it done right then it's not like we have a thousand other things to do where we're helping a hundred people and there's a list we're going down it's like let me stop everything that I'm doing right now and just take care of you and and that's not the way it always works is that right you call somebody you want something you want it done right then and I have a lot of customers who just you know who think they just hung the moon and the world revolves around them if I don't take care of them it's just the end of the world and that's not the way it works and I don't call people and expect that same thing and and as humans we just get this idea ideology that we are the most important thing the universe wraps itself around us and and were that we're it we're the one thing my little boy Matney when it comes to chocolate that's what the world revolves around is chocolate you know I asked him do you love me or chocolate chocolate every time it's it I know it's gonna be chocolate I don't have to question it I don't know it's just that's that's what his world revolves around and and you know so so as Christians and as people we've got to begin to look and say you know hey there's more than just me is that right there's more than just what I want and what what I need this is what what the Oh the greater picture is the bigger picture is what God wants me to be amen you know you hear all the time people saying well God told me to do this and God told me to do this listen God is not going to tell you anything that doesn't line with his word amen so if if somebody comes you said God told me to do this and it doesn't line with the word doesn't line with a message then God didn't tell them to do that when he speaks something from the you begin and his said his word will not return unto Him void it's not gonna change on the way back if God tells you to do something then and it lines with the word then it will come to pass say man do you love the Lord tonight and then we've got the people on the other side of the spectrum that God does tell them to do something God does give them a promise but they're too afraid to take it amen you've got the people who spend the money when there's no money and you got people who won't spend the money when there is money is that right now I'm a banker so that's just where my mind goes I'm not saying anything about anybody but you got people who don't have it they spin it you got people who do have it and whilst you couldn't get a penny out of them I always go back to my grandpa Wayne pep all Wayne and man you know he's worked all his life he's retired and and I'm sure he has some money but when he would take me and my cousin somewhere we stayed in the cheapest hotel we ate bologna sandwiches I mean it was it was rough living for me I thought but and these hotels were rough I'm talking rough hotels and so you know this place my mom probably wouldn't let me stay but you see you've got people on both end of the spectrum is that right you got some people are afraid to look at the word and say well this is for me is that right and you've got people who just go and throw it out everywhere well God said I can have this God said I can have that and they're speaking things into existence they're doing this and and as Christians we've got to align ourselves with the word we've got as brother branham said get back in line we've got to get back on point is that right because if you're off an inch at 20 yards at a hundred yards you're going to be off a couple feet and we know that and and so we see that as God is dealing with our lives and dealing with us as Christians we've got to align ourselves with the word and and as Christians I think when we when we align ourselves with the word we're looking at that atonement we're looking at that sacrifice and and we're constantly reminded this is what God did for me so that I would have eternal life and and anytime we begin to say this is what I did and this is I'm doing we get away from Christ amen you know we see that Moses endured chastening when he returned to Egypt and I love how brother Brandon put it he said what Moses lacked the burning bush had and and what the church lacks the Holy Spirit has is that right so everything that you don't have God's gonna supply it amen and everything that you do have if you've got a little bit of extra God might have to chasten you and chip that away too you can line with the true Christian God wants you to be amen amen you love the Lord this evening so the word atonement it's actually an agreement a Concord or reconciliation after enmity or controversy and so we'll go to Romans 5 if we can in verse 10 and it says for for if when we were enemies we were reconciled to God by the death of his son much more being reconciled we shall be saved by his life and not only so but we also joy in God through our Lord Jesus Christ by whom we now have received the atonement are you thankful for the atonement tonight he says wherefore as by one man sin entered the world and death by sin so and so death passed upon all men for that we all that all have sinned so we see that when sin entered in the garden it through all of man into the fall is that right from then on out it was a fall for man and sin had entered in so therefore death had entered in says for and it says for at verse 13 for unto the law sin was in the world but sin is not imputed where there is no law nevertheless death reigned from Adam and to Moses even over them that had not sinned after the similitude of Adam's transgression who is the figure of him that was to come but not as of the offence so also is the free gift for if through the offence of one many be dead much more the grace of God and the gift by grace which is by one man Jesus Christ has abounded unto many and I thought that's a lot of back and forth but if you look it was a gift it was a free gift and anything about a gift if brother bian came out and gave me a water and I gave him a dollar for it that's not a gift if he comes out and gives me a water and I take that I give him nothing in return that's a gift amen so I want you to know this free gift God didn't want any thing in return from you he didn't want you to do anything he didn't want you to mess it up or get involved in any way he gave you that free gift and and me and brother Brent Ben we're kind of talking before service and and that's the thing I love about Christianity when you lead somebody to Christ you can see that they actually met him by the fruits of their life is that right you can see if you lead somebody to legalism and they just change for church and they just change for this and just change dear and these times but their outward life doesn't reflect Christ is that right so that's the thing about Christianity if you if you actually if you actually are saved and filled with the Holy Ghost you can't help but express what's on the inside is that right you can you can you can cut every limb off an orange tree it doesn't change that it's an orange tree from that seed gene is that right and if Christ was away if you're that seat of Christ there's no devil no mountain no trial no no no problem that can ever bury that seed deep enough that it can't grow to the fruit of Jesus Christ so we see in verse 16 and not as it though not as it was by one that sinned so was the gift for the judgment by what was by one to condemnation but the free gift is of many offenses under justification for if by one man's offense death reigned by one much more they which receive abundance of grace and the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one Jesus Christ therefore as by the offence of one judgment came upon all men to condemnation and so all of us were born in sin and shaped in iniquity none of you were born perfect none of you were as much as I think my little girl is the cutest human being in the world she's not perfect she's got to have a change is that right many of you think yourself you think oh man I am the cat's meow I'm the perfect one let me tell you something if you have that attitude you will die and go to hell without Christ there's none of us it doesn't matter how good you preach how good you sing how good you dress how good you do this or pay your tithes are often without Christ you will go to hell is that right if you don't have that change in your life where that that soul that the master of your soul becomes Christ if you don't have that change there's no hope for you and I this evening so I don't care how you dress how you live how you do this if you don't have Christ on the inside it'll reflect on the outside a man you can fool people for so long but you can't fool him is that right in the end we've all got to stand we've got to stand for the life that we've lived a man do you love the Lord this evening so there for us by the offence of one judgment came upon all men to condemnation even so by the righteousness of one free gift came upon all men the justification of life for his by one man's disobedience many were made sinners so by the obedience of one shall many be made righteous are you thankful that in the garden he said let this pass if the cup could pass let it pass from me but he went to the cross knowing what he was gonna have to do knowing that our sin would be laid upon him and he went and made us righteous amen we took on his righteousness in the Indian Calvary moreover the law entered that the offence might be might abound but where sin abounded grace did much more abound are you thankful for that tonight now where sin was growing where sin was abounding grace come in and abounded greater than then sin could and that a sinneth reigned unto death even so might grace reign through the righteousness unto eternal life by Jesus Christ our Lord are you thankful for that this evening that God would come down and Men and form himself in the flesh of Jesus Christ and and we see that Jesus went to the cross and died so that your and I sins would be placed back upon him and you and I could go free is that right you know many times in our life we don't you know when I begin to think about it sometimes I begin to say why would he pick me why would he do this and I think as Christians and as believers you know we need to quit you know we need to quit asking why if God put us here if God chose us he's going to see through see us through to the end is that right God's gonna see us through he's not only gonna see us through but he's going to equip us to make every trial every tribulation we go through God has prepared you to overcome at a man do you love the Lord just because we see people fall by the wayside we see this one do this we see that one do that doesn't mean that you and I are not living the right life is that right it doesn't take anything away from Christ it only takes away from that person and their experience wasn't real now the bad thing as Christians is us well they can't come back it's not up to you and I to say who can or who can it's up to God he for Dana before the world if God put a seed down in that life doesn't matter what they did if God's gonna bring them back he will bring them back amen so if you've got children and loved ones that are out in the world don't give up hope is that right if Christ placed something on the inside of their life it could be the last minute or the last second but God will bring them in do you believe that a man as Christians many times we don't have the right to pick you know and and we go out and look in if you went out and you just lined us all up before maybe we were saved or in church and you went to pick and you would probably pick the completely wrong people is that right you begin to go back and look at my life or anybody else's life you say well I wouldn't pick them I wouldn't pick them but that's not the way God chose he Ford ain't if you understand predestination there was no way Satan could have you well as brother branham says we were sold out in the pawn shop there was there's only one way we were gonna get back to Christ and that was him coming and dying and becoming a kinsman for you and I do you love the Lord this morning you know I've never looked and I think it was brother Ben that was preaching I never looked at at Ruth and Boaz that way and how Ruth and I loved how he put it you know she had everything she needed she was gleaning in the right field she was laying at his feet and and and she was she was having all the food she needs she had a place to live she had practically everything but there was a desire in her heart to become a wife is that right and you and I we've it's good to hear the message it's good to read the word but until that life comes on the inside until that changes made it it's it becomes a relationship that you just can't explain is that right brother branham says then the inside man he says his provided he's provided away like the brass serpent he's provided Jesus to meet all that we have need for while we're in this journey between heaven and earth I want to read that again he provided Jesus to meet all that we have need of for while we're in this journey between heaven and earth so we can't say that God didn't prepare us for this or dot God didn't give me enough didn't give me enough will or enough strength if God brought you into it he'll see you through amen he provided Jesus Christ he's God's all sufficient sacrifice and if you look at that word all sufficient it covers everything it means that he is enough anything that you have to go through that all sufficient sacrifice will ring you through it amen everything you have need of tonight it's not in your church it's in Christ he says there it is it's not in your education it's not in your theology or what your Creed is he said it's in Jesus Christ look to him with simple humble loving faith and say God cleanse me from my selfishness and take on my impurities from me and let me from this day be wholly thine he said see what God will do for you and I believe as Christians tonight any in my life and when I say you know what I'm preaching I'm preaching mainly to myself and from myself if there's anything I want to do it's not I don't want to become more knowledgeable I don't want to be able to able to out quote people I want to know him more day after day amen I love I love this I don't know who said it but I heard a preacher say it one time he says God didn't tear down Jericho to prove who he was he tore down Jericho to prove who Rahab was and so when we begin to see that that he wasn't trying to prove anything about himself but he was wanting to prove in this day in the seventh age and this time when it's the darkest hour he's one to prove who the bride is amen and you and I are living this life of Christ and if he's on the inside we won't fall away we won't fail we won't do that he will see us through to the end do you love the Lord and I asked that question a lot while I preached so just a simple reminder the answer is yes and if the answer is not yes we will pray for you there's a there's a God who can come and take all the hate all the bitterness all the anger everything you've got stored up and he can turn that into divine love amen do you love the Lord this evening Isaiah 45 and 21 he says tell ye and bring them near yea he let them take counsel together who declared this from the ancient time who have told it from that time have not I the Lord and there is no God else beside me of just God and a savior there is none beside me look unto me and be you saved all you ends of the earth for I am God and there is none else do you believe that he said return that unto me every knee shall bow and every tongue shall swear he says surely shall one say in the Lord have I righteousness and strength even to him shall min come and all that are incensed against him shall be saved and so you know as Christians I think Abraham said you know the hardest thing God had to do was to get one mortal to believe another is that right and you know tonight you know I don't want you to believe me I don't want you to even maybe even listen to me or take everything I say for for a fact but you ought to take everything back to the word it's a Christians responsibility to take everything back to the Word of God is that right that and I promise you God will if God is the captain of your soul he will not lead you where you ought not to be you know just because you maybe don't understand the same thing that another person understands doesn't mean they're wrong and doesn't mean you're wrong you only can understand you can only see what God has allowed you to see but I promise if the desire in your heart is to see more God will show you more if your desire is to be closer to him then God will get you closer to him if your desires for your family to be stronger or something to happen in your family's life pray and ask God and believe that it shall come to pass a man but then God rich in mercy sent forth the Savior Jesus Christ he sent forth Jesus both Savior and healer for he said as Moses lifted up the brass serpent in the wilderness so must the Son of Man be lifted up for the same purpose and I love I want to focus it on that you know we look at the children of Israel and sometimes I just look at them and throw my hands up like they never learned and then I'm like well he said it's for the same purpose so maybe I don't ever learn as human being sometimes it's hard to get through our schools what is right is that right now we may not be doing the same thing the children of Israel did in in fullness but in part we begin to doubt is that right what a brother branham say sin was he said it's unbelief whenever you begin to unbeliev that God's gonna do something for you soon you know as soon as you get prayed for you got all this faith you were in this maybe maybe there was some some emotional emotional pull in the church and you believed it was gonna be done in the next day you don't have it you begin to doubt right away and you know God is looking down at us it's like well it's kind of like the children of Israel they they needed food God gave them food they needed water God gave him water and then all sudden they didn't like the food anymore they didn't like the water anymore and they began to murmur and complain and maybe we don't go to that same level but we ought to think as Christians sometimes what does God see when he looks back at us I know some of y'all to come up here and switch place with us one time and see what we're looking at you know you're looking at us we're looking at you and sometimes it's happy faces sometimes it's sleepy faces sometimes it's smiling faces you can see when people are engaged or see when people are disengaged and so many times we look at God and and in your we want to see what God sees in our life and and and I want you to know something as Christians if if you've got a question in your life or you've got something that you don't feel right about go to Christ about it come to the altar pray pray it through this is the most important thing in our life is that right you know many people say well this is my eternal destination and we don't really put much focus on it right we put all of our focus and efforts into these things but this is our eternal life our Redemption all everything all the culmination of everything we've done in our life should come to this this doorway where we transfer into eternal life you know if you look at the space if somebody lives a hundred years old and you compare that to eternal life it's not even a you know you can't actually compare it it's infinity you can't actually you can't comprehend it in the human mind and Matney always asked me all the time you know I'll say I love you he says well I love you infinity that's the biggest number in the world you know say well how big is infinity I'm like well there's really not a number just zeros just continue on forever and ever and he's like so there's not a number I'm like well there is a number but it just continues on forever and ever and every weekend the human mind cannot comprehend it and he can't comprehend what I'm trying to explain to him I believe it was Einstein said if you couldn't explain to a fourth grader what you thought you knew then you really don't understand it and sometimes we got people trying to explain things to other people you know we want to explain this or explain why we do this or explain why we do that I promise you if you can get somebody to Christ everything will make sense amen if we can get them to the fountain if they can taste of that fountain they'll thirst no more is that right when Jesus come to the woman of Samaria he wasn't trying to explain anything wasn't trying to do this he just said hey you are you thirsty and he begin to tell her about her life and and so as Christians we ought to be that we ought to be that water and we I think brother Branham said it the best he said you know we're his hands wears physical hands were his feet were his voice in this day he says but God he said but God rich in mercy says he says as Moses lifted up the brass serpent in the wilderness so must the Son of Man be lifted up for the same purpose he the atonement that what we have claimed upon nothing but the atonement he said what Jesus purchased by his blood that's what we have claims upon and the Bible said he was wounded for our transgression he was bruised for our iniquity the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with His stripes we are healed and that's what we can claim because that's what the atonement that's what's what we stand for he says we're healed that's what we can claim he says that's what God ordered for us God rich in mercy he says this was to be an eternal atonement he says because he came himself and God came himself in the form of sinful flesh an eternal atonement and he suffered in flesh and made the atonement and returned back in the form of the Holy Ghost to confirm that atonement he said we're no brass serpent or troubled water could do it all pointed to the perfect atonement God rich in mercy has did this thing so we see that when God did this thing it wasn't to point to you and I are point to a man but it was point to Christ is that right look and live upon him is that right if we're looking at anything else besides Christ we're looking at the wrong thing we've got to look and live hey man do you love the Lord this evening as Christians we've got one goal and that's to finish this race is that right it's a hard race we get discouraged we get downhearted we get downtrodden but if God be for us who can be against us this evening in this evil age in the darkest hour the light will shine the brightest is that right I preached a sermon one time what are we preparing for it's preparing for a rapture and and many times in our life we prepare to come to church on Sunday and we prepare to come to church on Wednesday but as Christians I remember when I was a young kid when every day I thought the rapture was going to happen that's how much the focus was on every dot when I went to bed I didn't think I was going to wake up because I thought the rapture was going to happen and I feel like his Christians we've kind of gotten away from that we've kind of gotten away from thinking the rapture could happen the next day amen but as Christians we ought to focus on praying that the rapture takes place the next day and preparing ourselves we know brother Branham said hey pack your lunch do your things keep going on about your daily lives but are we preparing for a rapture anymore are we looking for that rapture to actually be tomorrow morning or order this evening whatever we're looking are we looking for a rapture to come job 16 and 19 says also now behold my witnesses in heaven and my record is on high I'm so thankful that he didn't need me to be a witness he didn't call me to to stand in my own place and plead my case but he pled my case is that right he pled you're in our case that when the enemy come in and put all this evidence against you and I I love how brother Branham puts it he says he takes you know when the Son of God is on the other side of that chasm I love how he says the Son of God comes back onto the the right side of the chasm with Christ but I also love focusing on the point where he says and all that sin that was on that son of God was laid back on the accuser so he becomes the guilty one is that right that all the things that Satan made you do wrong all the things that that sin brought into the picture is all laid back on the responsible party which is Satan is that right and you and I go free he said behold my witnesses in heaven and my record is on high and brother branham says in divine love he says and I know only he says I only know one thing here it is he says I want you to hear it there's only one thing that will conquer the devil and that's pure divine love love will conquer everything he said God so loved the world it conquered the sin question it conquered the sickness question it'll conquer the difference in the church it'll conquer everything there is unlike it to be conquered he says it'll do it if you'll just let it do it and that's one thing I found out as a husband and a father if I come into a situation where there's trouble and I bring more trouble and more stress to the situation guess what it only gets worse you know many times we think well you know Pete the kids are mad if I bring my anger into it it will fix it but it doesn't really make sense is that right that's like saying well I'm gonna put this fire out with gasoline I'm gonna throw more on it but no if we look at the Word of God divine love when you can truly say you love someone when you disagree with someone when whenever they whatever they may be done wrong against you but you can look at them and forgive them that's the kind of love we have to get to amen and that's the divine love that Christ represented when they pulled his beard when they slapped him when they called him names he's reviled not as that right do you love the Lord this evening a man I told you is gonna be very simple and not very much longer so just just hang in with me and we'll we'll finish it up a man when I get to preaching on the atonement and forgiveness and all the things that the devil did and I can place it back on him and it just kind of gets me excited a little bit a man that that everything that he tricked me into do it and everything that I did wrong it all goes back to him you know I can I get a little bit excited about that amen you know my little boy asked me the other day says what's the difference in a trick in a lie that's a hard question to answer for a kid you know but it is true the devil he tricked us into doing this that's what brother Branham said he tricked us into doing this and and I believe as people we ought to have maybe you know we ought to be mature enough to know that that this isn't a law to say oh God's gonna forgive us of everything he's wiped everything away this is not a freedom to sin if anybody looks at the Word of God and and looks at grace and say this is a freedom to sin they don't have Christ on the inside when when you begin to love love him and and you begin to love the things that he loves and you begin to love the word that he's put forward because that life on the inside can only reflect what's on the inside is that right and so whenever you see somebody say well this is a freedom to sin when you hear me preach it on grace and maybe I focused more on grace than I do the law but you know when I preach it on grace that it's not a freedom to sin if you if you look at it that way you need to get right with God is that right anybody who looks for a way to find freedom to sin needs to get right with God I may not believe everything that you believe or see everything that you are understand but but I know one thing that if you were living like Christ it'll reflect on the outward man amen he said and there shall be a great cry and excuse me Exodus 11 and verse 6 and I just like to look at this for a few moments and and there should be a great cry throughout all the land of Egypt such as there was none like it nor shall it be like any more but against the children of Israel shall not a dog move his tongue any against man or beast that you may know that the Lord does put a difference between the Egyptians in Israel and I love that little phrase he's put a difference he put a difference in our life in the world's life is that right he puts then he put something different into us sometimes we say we're a little different but God put a difference in between you and us and the world is that right he placed something in our lives that maybe we can't comprehend or understand at times but he put a difference that we could serve him in this evil age when all the world is going crazy when when everything seems to be going wrong and spun out of control we know that we have a father a man that knows the number of hairs upon our head then he will see us through until the rapture amen John 9 and verse 24 then again they called the man that was blind and said to him give God praise we know that this man is a sinner and he answered and said whether he be a sinner or no I know not one thing I know that whereas I was blind I now see him I'll give a little backstory to this in John chapter 9 you see that Jesus and the disciples are coming down through the streets and they come upon a blind man and and the disciples asked Jesus a question and said who sinned this man or his father is that writer you go back and read the whole story in John chapter 9 they said who sinned this man or his father and I love how Jesus said neither this man sinned nor his father or his parents he said but he was made blind so that the works of God might be made manifest in his life and you begin to look at the store and you read all the way down through it and we realized that this man was blind from birth just so God could do a miracle in his life and I always go back to this when I'm going through something I don't understand I go back to this scripture I say hey this is just so God can perform a miracle in my life amen if you don't understand what you're going through you don't know why this has happened or what's going on around you just know God's working a miracle to see you through to the other side and we see the Pharisees got mad that jesus healed him on the Sabbath they come to him and they were mad Nate they come to the son and they said hey we you've got to reject this he's a sinner he says he says I don't know what to do so they go to his parents and to confirm that he was blind from birth and then they want the parents to do something about their like hey he's a v's of age let him speak you know the parents are afraid of the Pharisees let the boy speak and I love this phrase he says hey I don't know if he's a sinner or not but one thing I know that whereas I was blind I now see amen you may not be able to say I don't know why used to do the things I did not don't anymore but whereas once I was blind I now can see Amen it's not up to you and I to choose who's gonna make it and who's not gonna make it but if they were once blinding God opened their eyes they will see Amen he said the Christian experience is based solemnly and wholly upon rest he says come unto me all ye that are heavy there heavy laden and I will give you rest he says we're tossed about with everything until you come to Christ and then it's all finished resting in Christ perfectly says no matter what comes or go nothing can touch us without it comes over the Shepherd he has to permit it the Bible said all things work together for the good to them that love the Lord he has to come over the Shepherd first he said I'm the door and no man can come in without me excepting he says let me let me tell you that when God permits anything it's working - you're good let's focus on that sentence because we heard all this God doesn't let anything bad or didn't let anything come through he says when something happens to you God's working it for your good do you believe that he said so what sickness be the same thing he said certainly that God might heal you just to show a great testimony give you a little something to move on for he said all things work together for their good we see that God uses us in his life and you know God can't show a miracle unless something happens that needs a miracle is that right we all want healing but if you want healed you got to get sick first if you want a miracle in your life you got to go through the struggles and the trials to get that miracle amen I remember when I was a young kid I always wanted to seek I want to always want a God to talk to me I always wanted to hear inaudible voice I always needed something to move me to the altar you know God speak to me and tell me it's my time to go and and you know I was always focused on the signs and you know and then that type of thing and you know I begin to come to a point where you know I really wanted it and you know I heard someone you know preach on desires one time and and and check your desires to see what's really in your heart and and you know God beginning to move on my life and and I believe as Christians you know many times we still need to go back and check our desires what is our desire to be what is our desire for our families and this and we can see that if your desire is to be more like Christ is to be a Christian then we know that that's the right thing is that right but if our desires are to focus on the world and do these these things and this and that then we know we need to get right God we need to check ourselves is that right now in Genesis 50 and verse 15 and I just want to read on this just real quick before we close and I may not get to everything but and when Joseph's brethren saw their father was dead they said Joseph / / venture hate us and will certainly require all the evil which we did unto Him and they sent a messenger unto Joseph saying my father did command before he died saying so shall you saying to Joseph's forgive I pray thee now the trespass of thy brethren and their sin for they did under the evil and now we pray thee forgive the trespass of thy servants of God and of the Father and Joseph wept when he spake to them and so we see that the the brothers that had done Joseph's wrong are now afraid that now that their father's dead Joseph's gonna come back and and do bad things and what we would call revenge is that right and uh you know I'm go ahead and tell you in your life if you have a problem with revenge or bitterness or when something happens to somebody that's bad and you get excited and say they deserve that you're probably not right yourself and I'm just gonna call it like it is if you're happy to see somebody fall or or mess up you need to get saved a man is that right a man I'll say it again if you like to see people get in trouble or fall you need to get saved I'll put it plain and simple I think the Bible says you know if you say you love God but love not your brother you were a liar that's about as plain and simple as I can put it if you say you love God but don't love your brother you're a liar so we see here tonight that Joseph you know they send this letter to Joseph because they're like he's gonna remember all the bad things we did to him and Joseph and Joseph wept when they spake unto him and his brethren also went and fell down before his face and they said Behold we be thy servants and Joseph said having them fear not for I'm in the place of God and he's saying that as a question he says but as for you he thought evil against me but God meant it unto good he said to bring to pass as it is the day to save much people alive now therefore fear ye not I will nourish you and your little ones and be comforted and he comforted them and spoke calmly unto them and so as Christians this is you know as Joseph is typing Christ in many ways we see that if somebody did wrong to us if somebody wronged us and somebody did wrong you know to us we ought not to go back to and perform evil upon those people is that right I believe brother Branham says that's a God power when you can return good for evil is that right he said now if you're a prophet tell us who you are he said who hit you and will believe you he could have done it but he said I'll just do it as the father shows me what was it he always believed and let me stop right there because I want to make sure I get this point across now somebody continually does evil against you you should separate yourself from that person right if someone you know if you if somebody does evil against you and you forgive them they come back and do evil again and you forgiving they come back and do evil again there's a point where you've got to say hey listen I love you but you gotta move on right you know you're messing with my life you're messing with with you know the what we would say today good vibes were here you're messing up everything you're kind of hindering everything in my life and there's a point you've got to say that to some people and and you know so I want to make sure that's clear not we should just go out and say oh you know you did me so wrong I'm so sorry I forgive you not that we're not that we're bowing down to people or not that we're just just becoming wimps or not standing up for what we believe in but there's got to come a point when we love those people enough to not hold it against them amen I love the quote it says bitterness is like taking poison and expecting the other person to die and that's the thing that bitterness will do to you you you you are bitter in yourself at someone else and you you you look at them and you take the poison and expect them to be the ones that get sick from it that's not the way it works hey man do you love the Lord I got way off topic there for a few minutes but whoever that was for there you go how could Satan say that that man could be God and man that could take the challenge of a priest and let a drunken soldier spit in his face and today we got the wrong conception of power power is overcoming and returning good for evil says that's real power he says that you can love your enemy and do good for those that do evil to you that's real power that's God Perry says yes maniacs can break change but it takes a real man to return good from evil from his heart not because of religious duty but from his heart and I'm not saying this is a freedom to let everybody do what they want to do and we just forgive them and go on that's not what I'm saying but if somebody does does evil upon you you can return good for evil is that right now brother Branham says in the salutation in Revelation 2 and 8 he says these things saith the first and last which was dead and is alive the first and last which was dead and is alive now there are not the words of these are not the words of man a mere man could he speak from the grave would say I'm the first and the last which was alive and is dead he said the first thing that happens to a man that that when he's born he's alive and the last thing that happens is that he dies so this man is not speaking he says this is not a man speaking this is deity man Adam he said took life and turned it into death but this man Jesus took death and turned it into life Adam took innocent and turn it into guilt this one took guilt and turned it into righteousness are you thankful for that tonight that all the guilt that was placed upon you and I he changed it out for righteousness amen he said Adam took paradise and turned it into a waste howling wilderness but this one is coming back to turn and earth rocking and reeling and with destruction into another Eden are you looking forward to that day he said Adam took a life of fellowship and joy with God and turned it into a desert of spiritual darkness that brought forth all sin moral decay pain suffering delusion and corruption that wars within the soul of man but this one from all the tragic death and degradation and that fueled all mankind brought forth a life of righteousness and beauty so that a sin once reigned unto death even so men now reign in righteousness by one Christ Jesus not as the offence was though terrible indeed it was but now much more his is his gift unto eternal life so we see what Christ did for you and I we see what laid within that atonement that when we looked and lived we had that ability to claim our healing in that our salvation was in that there's so many things in the atonement that you and I all we have to do is look and live do you believe that tonight I believe many times as Christian we try to make it too difficult we try to make it too hard for us to come in or for our children or for others if God ever gets ahold of somebody he won't let him go I can promise you that is that right we see that when God wants to deal with a person he will come down and he will he will speak in such a way that that person will know that it is him many times you hear different ministers come and speak and brother Ben will be able to reach people that I'll never be able to reach and brother Stuart will be able to reach people that we could never reach and you see God has different gifts in different callings that will come to people and they can speak directly not that the man speaking but that God is speaking to his children in such a way that they know that he's speaking right to them amen are you thankful for that you know I remember when I was kind of trying to trying to get my life right with God I would say God speak to me and then he would you know the minister would come up and and God would speak to me and tell me all the things I was doing wrong and how I needed a change is like okay maybe we don't need to speak that much but you know as a Christian your desires to hear from God is that right and God's gonna get you back in line and this isn't something you can just fix overnight you know I always thought that with my children I thought I could just turn them into responsible mature adults overnight I have found out greatly that is impossible to do it didn't happen with me it won't happen with them it didn't happen with my wife you know I'm still maturing I'm 32 I'll be honest my wife still has to get on to me sometimes you know sometimes me and the kids we get out on the floor and wrestle I'm a big kid but we're all not gonna change just like this and I think as Christians that's what we want to see is just I want them to be perfect right now that's when the body change happens when we become perfect when we see him as he is because we will be like him amen that's when the body change happens and you and I become just like he is but until then we ought not to point out everybody's faults and point this out and point that out but we ought to love one another and pray for one another that we would all come to the fullness of God as that right that we would all come to that rapture and preparedness that we're ready to take a rapture hey Mandy love the Lord this evening as the musicians would go ahead and come but we see that if God has called us he's also equipped us to see us through to the end and I love that you know you look it you looked down through the Bible and you look at all the heroes of faith and all the people that were that were there may be used as examples in the Bible I would not picked any of those people you know I wouldn't have picked Abraham I wouldn't have picked Rahab I wouldn't have picked the woman at the well I wouldn't have picked the maniac in the in the graveyard we wouldn't have picked these people and and I think we ought to go and look and say you know I wouldn't have picked myself right you know I wouldn't have come down if I was just being an on a non-biased judge I wouldn't have picked me I probably wouldn't have picked brother Ben I wouldn't have picked Joel with a big day but I would have picked any of y'all but God knew who would see through to the end is that right God knew when he placed his seed out there by predestination by foreknowledge he knew who would follow him is that right and whenever you come to Christ and that seeds on the inside no matter if you fall you're gonna make mistakes you're gonna have trials along the way things are gonna come up that you don't know how to fix things are gonna happen that you don't understand but if you've got that seed gene on the inside God will see you through to the end amen do you believe that hey man do you love the Lord this evening a man I truly believe that if God has called us he's equipped us he's prepared us and and you know he doesn't just throw us out and just to see what happens he's gonna see us through to the end day man if we could
