so I mean you love the Lord this morning and we'll slow it down just a little bit right before we have brother Ben come amen I think it's okay to smile in church and have a good time so sometimes I think we come just a little too a little too serious or maybe not serious is the right word but burdened with the outside weight of the world so I think we should you know Paxton on the way to church this morning the song said what tomorrow brings and he goes what does tomorrow bring I was like I don't know nobody knows I think I was like what's a scary thought it's like well that's why we pray and God takes care of us so amen blessing this song As the deer so we just slow it down before we have our pastor come out amen as we change the word of the service over as the dear [Music] you alone

Lord to know that you're with us and Lord you you care about the things that we're going through in life and the little problems and situations Lord that maybe even happen this morning but Lord we know that you're able to come and and fix every every problem Lord you're able to take care of every situation you knew before hard we had the problem that we would have it before we had the sickness that we would need healing Lord and so you provided a way for us to be healed for us to be whole Lord and we thank you for that today Lord I pray for these that are listening here Lord that will be participating in the service I I pray Lord that you would just open up our eyes and help us to know something from your word we know there's nothing unimportant Lord if it comes from your word so help us Lord to stir up our minds and our memories Lord and and come back to the word of God and realize that what you told us we can live by Lord we can feed on it or to become what you'd have us to be in this age for you granted today heal every sick person touch every every heart we pray in Jesus name amen amen second Kings chapter 12 and verse 1. Second Kings 12 and 1 we'll read down through verse 3. I made a mistake last week we were supposed to have communion and it was the month the first of the month we have communion every other month and I argued with Joel last week for about 30 minutes about that I I was certain that we'd had it and sister Sharon asked me this morning I told you wrong as well but we will have it next month the first Sunday of next month so you deacons keep me uh keep me informed as to what time that is because I evidently just forgot and y'all forgive me it just shows how human that I am and my wife already knew that but the rest of you learned that and uh so I apologize about that I do take that seriously I try to have it on a regular basis and uh so we could be prepared for that but we'll do it the first Sunday of next month on that Sunday evening I remember no service on Wednesday the 10th meeting starts on Wednesday night I heard that brother Andrew Glover is supposed to be speaking on Wednesday night so it'd be good if you can go and hear him I know this church loves brother Andrew and uh and then they'll have service all the rest of the week and different different preachers good preachers preaching so but we will have church here next Sunday amen second Kings chapter 12 and verse 1. in the seventh year of jehu jeho Ash and it's the same person as joash the king began to Reign and 40 years reigned he in Jerusalem and his mother's name was zebaya of Beersheba and jehosh did that which was right in the sight of the Lord all his days oh I wish that could be written about me and if I go before the coming of the Lord that someone would write that in my Epitaph that they could say that about me that I did what was right but there's a qualifier when it comes to King joash it says all his days wherein Jehovah the priest instructed him so as long as he set under that Ministry of jehodaya the priest as long as he was counseled by him he stayed with the word he uh he stayed in church if we could say it that way he did what was right but there were some things he didn't do he said the high places were not taken away the people still sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places I pray the Lord would add his Blessing to the word you may be seated I want to speak to you tonight about the counselor this morning rather about the counselor part of having a happy home and a nice home is listening to the right people and it's something we all have to do and none of us really want to do is listen to people and yet you have to be careful who you listen to Larry Burkett the old uh he was a financial advisor I think he's passed on now but he said A wise man seeks much counsel a fool listens to all of it so you you have to understand that there's a lot of bad advice out there someone has said that that most common one of the most common things in this country is bad advice it's everybody's got advice and most of it is bad but we need to know who to listen to and I like that the scripture shows us this that as long as the priest jehodaya was alive and and he was instructing joash in the things of God that joash continued to do what was right and we know joash lived for many many years and perhaps when jehodaya died he thought well now I've reached a place where I don't need advice anymore I don't need counsel I don't need to reach out to anybody because I I'm older and he reigned for I think some 40 years and he said well I'm older now I can go do it on my own but we never reached the age where we can completely do without advice advice isn't just for young married couples counsel isn't just for them but it's for us as well have been around a little bit longer and even those who are much older sometimes you just need to ask and I know that's hard on some of us especially us men we don't like asking for advice we don't like asking for directions I'll be honest with you my wife every time we have this thing if I don't know where something is in the store I'll call her and ask her and she but if she don't know I won't ask the person at the front how many other men we got brother Mark knows what I'm talking about and so I don't want to ask and I don't know what it is it's just hard I do not want to ask the guy and admit that I don't know where the pepperoncini peppers are you know I just I don't even not even sure what they are but I've stood there before and and stared at the Shelf full of peppers and full of pickles or whatever it is and I just don't see it and but instead of asking it it has to I have to be really desperate and really want something to ask because it there's something about it that you have to kind of humble yourself to ask for advice and at directions the same way if back in the day when we didn't have GPS we had to ask for directions and and many times a man we were famous for that we don't like to ask for directions we'd rather be lost than someone know that we were lost but when that comes into our spiritual lives we that's a problem sometimes we just need to talk to somebody and again we've got to be careful who we talk to and who we listen to because some people got some really bad advice right don't don't ask and sometimes here's the problem as human beings we tend to ask the wrong people because we're looking for an Echo chamber I read a story about a about a man who was golfing and he was out on the practice range and here come a golf pro with a brand new golfer he was bringing him out there and he was standing there and and golf is harder so I've been told a couple times I've only been a couple times in my life and I didn't do well and but I was never taught and this golf pro is going to bring this man out and he stood there and the man was observing him as he began to teach him and he'd do something he'd say well that's not how you do it you do it differently every time he did the man he brought out would correct him he said oh no he said I think it's this way and said after a while the golf pro just just quit giving him advice and so every time he just say yeah that's right you just go ahead and do that and the man was worse when he left and when he come in and but but he the golf pro still got paid and and so the other man told the golf pro he said I can't believe that you let him tell you those things and agreed with him he said I learned a long time ago that if a man wanted to pay me to be an echo chamber I would let him right and there's people out there like that oh yeah you go ahead you know somebody's out of church don't ask them whether you should go to church or not all right they want you to be out of church too so they feel better about themselves somebody that that does things that are wrong constantly and continually habitually now sometimes you can get good advice from somebody who has been wrong but realize they were wrong and straightened it up but with somebody that's habitually making the same mistake you don't want to ask them about that they're they're making the same mistake you don't want to make so we need to seek counsel from the right people and as we move through this I want us to especially understand that we must also reach a place of maturity that we realize that that there's some things that God has to reveal to us and we need to get to a place where he is our counselor and he's able to the Holy Spirit actually is able to lead us and to guide us into the right way how many want that this morning so we it's important to ask for advice to ask for help the Bible tells us in Proverbs 20 and 5 counsel in the heart of man is like deep water but a man of understanding will draw it out steep water he's just like a well but a man of understanding will draw it out in other words he's saying don't be arrogant or you'll Reveal Your Own ignorance right sometimes not asking just makes you ignorant but he said a man of understanding will pull it out he'll he'll he'll put the bucket in and he'll he'll make an effort to spend time around people who know more than he does you don't want to just spend time around people like you right you want to spend time around people who know things that you don't know because if you do that you'll end up learning things that you didn't know you know there are things that you don't know what's a revelation isn't it there's things I don't know are you with me now but if I hang out around somebody who's done it longer than I have and been experienced sometimes I'll learn something that I didn't know right and it's amazing Sometimes some of the questions I get and I scratch my head sometimes I think well I can't believe people didn't know that but but still if you don't know you need to ask don't assume that you know right and sometimes I think we need to ask more questions myself included so so what's he telling us in the scripture the more you actually understand the more you'll seek advice from others right you found that that's true if you've got a career you've got a job you've learned and I learned who to ask for advice and the reason why I got I guess fairly good at my job at least they didn't fire me I walked away from my job when I took the church but I kind of sort of retired at a young age and but uh just no no retirement money to go with it but but I did walk away from my job and one of the things that I did though while I was there is I learned to lean on people and and I had people who had done it for 40 and 50 years and they weren't always right but they had usually been through that before because things tend to go in cycles and so usually they had they had dealt with that before and I learned that there were certain attorneys that I could ask for advice and get good advice and there were other attorneys that didn't care and so they just give me whatever popped on top of their head and they'd get me in trouble so I had we had underwriting attorneys in in my job I don't want to bore you this morning but there was one that I stayed away from I never asked him on anything important in fact I only asked him when I knew the answer and I and I needed him to sign off because I knew that he would right you've known people like that whatever I said had to be right yeah and that actually got me in trouble more than once because I thought I knew the answer but there was another attorney she would challenge me every time because she'd been doing it for 80 years or it seemed like and and she's been doing it all her life and and but she she had run across this before and she cared enough and that's a key right there you've got to talk to somebody that cares enough to to not only answer the question but to know enough about you to know why you're asking the question right because people ask questions for all kinds of different reasons so we've got to take time to pray do we still believe in prayer this morning I trust that you do we need to pray because that's the council we can get directly from God we need to pray and then take time to ask because sometimes God will reveal it to us through a person so and Proverbs 19 and 20 says Hear counsel and receive instruction that tell me is to be wise in thy latter end nobody comes into the world with wisdom right you know you're not just naturally born with wisdom you may be smart but you've got to learn and wisdom is not just learning but it's actually learning and having the ability to apply it so wisdom is more than just understanding or knowledge and so if you want wisdom if you want to be wise in your latter end when you get older if you want to be like brother Harold and be a a wise Sage with your gray hair and everything then if you want to be that way you've got to be willing to receive instruction at some point in your life and I've found listen to me I found some of the older folks that have been through some things are more willing to ask when they don't know then some of the folks that think well I know right and but we all need to be that way we just need to we need to sometimes just admit I'm not perfect I I make mistakes amen I I I'm a human being and human beings make mistakes that's who I am and so I need to find I need to find a place of counsel I read a story about a navigator who uh who was sure that he knew the directions to a certain airport and they were flying over a Canada over a country that was snowy and they got in a storm and so they're flying by their instruments and he set a certain course and and after a while they got a message from a control tower that could see they had veered off course they were going the wrong direction and they messaged him and they said sir they said you you've got the wrong instructions you you've messed up but see it was the control tower as a person he never had any confidence in he never talked to before and he was so sure that he was right that he continued going the way he was going and everybody in the plane actually died we need to understand where we're going he said well it's not that important what I do but it is important it's important to you and to your children and to the people that follow you now is this all right this morning when do we need counsel because we don't always need counsel right there's sometimes and I found that this is true sometimes people ask because because they this is just what they want to do and they want somebody to back them up but they already know what to do and it's not that all right but they're looking for somebody to back them up and looking for an Echo chamber and but when do we need counsel well when especially when it comes to the spiritual side because you can ask Council about natural things and I and I've told you this before but you if you ask me about a car I may not be able to tell you I may not be the best judge of vehicles right I bought some but I haven't I haven't had a real great track record buying cars are you surprised by that so if you ask me about it I can tell you what I did wrong but I may not you can ask me about your car praise God but there's nothing spiritual you know unless I would pray and the Lord would show me something but the Lord could show you something right so you can ask you're welcome to ask but it probably it may not do a whole lot of good but there's times in your life when there's Junctions as we travel through life we come to hard Corners turns and brother random told us that anybody can build a wall but it takes a prophet he said to see around the corner and so we need to go back to find out what a prophet said about certain things so sometimes we need to ask a pastor or ask somebody when we come to those hard Junctions of life like like who should I marry or should I get married right am I am I ready to do that and I remember asking before I came here to be a pastor before I accepted the invitation to come and then and then even try out for it I asked my pastor I said I said I know you can't tell me what to do I said but tell me if I'm ready all right tell me if I'm ready and then if you tell me that I'm ready then it gives me a little more confidence now that wouldn't admit that if you told me no that it wouldn't necessarily have done it but would have made me pray about it right it really made me get down to business because I had confidence in my pastor and so we ought to be able to ask about those important things now some some things we need help navigating sometimes we need to ask our wives and all the wives said amen huh not really but sometimes we need to ask our wives sometimes you need to ask your husband right there's times that we need to have walls or pointers that need navigating and you can't see yourself and so you need the perspective of someone else to be able pastors need to do that Sunday school teachers need to do that deacons need to do that and no matter how old you get you never get to a place where you well I just don't need it anymore and so you have walls that need turning they have married Jezebel at a junction in his life marriage is a junction so obviously he made a bad choice we can see that but AB couldn't see it and again I've told you in the life of Abe wasn't a bad guy it's not a bad dude but he excuse me for using that in the in the Pulpit but it just don't seem to be that bad of a guy but he does some horrible things makes some really bad decisions and one of them is marrying Jezebel and brother Madam told us he said that was a junction in his life and that's where he went off and I'm so happy to see uh those of you that are getting married not not marrying a jezebel because when you marry a jezebel you're going to have a jezebel as a counselor right because Jezebel will counsel but she'll give bad advice so we don't want to do that and and the the vice versa as well a woman you you have to you have to ask you need to you need to you need to seek counsel it don't mean you necessarily have to take it again only a fool accepts all the counsel that's offered to them but you need to you need to ask so you'll have uh something to work with When you pray when you go to a church that's important when you choose a church to go to we need to we need to pray about that we really do and and we need to ask we need to find out what kind of a church that that is when we and I I want to maybe dwell on this more next week so I won't spend as much time on it this week when we take a position in the church when we take a position we need to seek counsel because a position ought to be a place of Revelation I know I belong there and you operate in that position by a gift no matter what you do in the church if all you do is is take out the laundry right or clean the floors but there's you have an ability to do that right a gift something that in you to do that you operate by a gift now it's not the same as a faithful Ministry gift but it is a gift if you help with the with the dishes or or wash the dishes or or you help cook the food or whatever I know I I know this isn't jump and Shout this morning but you just hang with me for a while you know whatever it is that you do around the church you have a position it needs to be a revelation to you because if it's not a revelation to you you won't be faithful to it you don't realize the importance of it but if you realize how important it is for you to be at that spot and to be be filling your Pew and and to be there and and to stand there even on a Sunday morning or a Wednesday night or whatever it is once you realize the importance of that position it becomes a revelation to you and and how can you get that you know sometimes we need to ask should I do it not not can I do it but should I do it because not everybody that can fill a position should so who should we ask for counsel well more than one person now this it's a dangerous thing when we get to the place where there's only one person we ever ask for advice and usually when that's the case it's because that person is echoing us it's affirming us right right and that's what we want today isn't it affirmation brother Ben give me some affirmation okay I'll tell you go back to the word right but give me some affirmation and there's a place and a time for that but that's what we want many times but so we go to a person who will affirm Us in what we're doing and we do that on purpose but sometimes we need to ask many people Proverbs 11 14 says where no counsel is the people fall but in the multitude of counselors they're at safety uh Proverbs 24 6 for my wise counsel Thou shalt make thy war and in multitude of counselors they're at safety this is where joash made his mistake jehodaya was his only counselor and when he died he didn't move on oh God help us today how many people have done that around the message of the hour where their Pastor or or their leader or or maybe brother random himself passed away and he we have to move on and they would never accept counsel from anybody else and because they would never accept counsel from anybody else they begin to make bad decisions because we are people that need counsel no because now we should never lift one man up as the one who has all the answers right well you've got to be careful with that don't do that to me I I beg you I know that you don't but but don't do that to me because if I'm the guy that's got all the answers then that's a problem because I can be wrong there's two things that are true of all men they're fallible and they're mortal men are fallible and Mortal the best men the most dedicated men are still fallible and they're still mortal yes right so you need to sometimes you need to ask more than one person you need to have confidence in more than one person I want you to have confidence in me as a pastor but I want you to have confidence in these other ministers as well I want you to have confidence in one another because I may not always have the best advice I'll give you advice if you come ask for it that's free man I'll give you more than you ask for yeah but I'll give you advice even if you don't go here to church I I pass out advice on the freeway but that don't make it right but in the multitude of counselors there's safety now again joash did that he needed another jehodaya but he never couldn't move on and Satan wants to do that to you where you don't have confidence in in a pastor because of something that's happened to you in the past and until until you get to the place where you'll listen when I talk you know your kids are like that if you won't listen uh when uh when your parents if they won't listen when the parents talk you can't ever help them right they have to get to a place where they have enough so if they won't listen to you screaming at them doesn't help right they can shut out screaming you remember what it was like to be a kid you can sit there and yell at them all day long they'll never listen because they have you haven't opened them up right you got to get in their head somehow and open up that Spirit or and that mind to be able to listen to you just yelling and my kids should have said Amen on that I guess they're busy this morning but uh but you know just yelling doesn't work but you sometimes you need to take them on a fishing trip or do something with them and be a part of their lives now when it comes to being a pastor again I know that there's there's sometimes I can't tell you things that I I probably need to tell you but until I can get the key to unlock that there's nothing I can do so sometimes we really need the presence of God we really need the right atmosphere because in that atmosphere it unlocks you it makes you vulnerable to where you can receive the word and the seed can be planted and without the right atmosphere I can stand up here all day and say things but you're you haven't been unlocked your brain is is out there somewhere and or you're thinking or you've been hurt or you've been you've been scarred and you just can't you can't take it at face value and again I'm not asking you to believe everything I say but if it's the word we need to receive it amen and so we need to ask many people who do we need to ask we ask someone with experience and experience is not the same as age right it can be the same as age it's more often you're more likely to find an experienced person who's older simply because they've lived longer but just because they're old doesn't mean their experience if you've never done it you've never done it the Bible says the the hoary head and what that means is you're white-headed right praise God for the white-headed folks but David you've always been white-headed that don't mean you're old but my mother's been that way as well she's had white hair for years and years and years until anyway it's naturally white so almost ever since I can remember we were talking about that tonight I can remember when she was blonde but it was a long time ago she's still blonde but not um anyway not hair color so I woke you up didn't it so it should come with you know experience should come with age but it don't always so he says the whorehead or the gray head is a Crown of Glory if it be found in the way of righteousness right this is what illahu realizes in job 32 6 now who have said there can you imagine the conversation he sat there through the whole thing the Book of Job is a long book and it's full of job complaining and there's three friends complaining and job says I didn't deserve this I don't belong this isn't me and every once in a while he hits inspiration and he's up and he's down and and then his friends come up here and say you're a secret sinner you did something that God's punishing you for and so they just constantly going around and around and around and around about it and Ella who's sitting back because he's much younger than these other men and so he sits back and he says I he says I don't even want to speak he said age should speak and that's true but in this situation age was wrong because they'd never been through what job went through but brother Branham typed elohu with Christ amen in Christ as I've told you before wasn't even old enough to be on the Sanhedrin Council but he had inspiration from God he was God in flesh and so elohu says I'm young and you are very old I love the way he put that he didn't just say you're old you're very old you guys are ancient he said wherefore I was afraid and does not show you my opinion I said they should speak multitude of years should teach wisdom but there is a spirit in man oh no don't ever forget that church there what we want is inspired advice inspired counsel counsel that goes according to the word and that's why most of the counseling that we do although I'll be glad to talk to you anytime but a lot of the counseling we do is over the pulpit because it may be something I don't even know that's going on this morning I don't I'm not preaching this because I know something I'm preaching this because it's on my heart then if it's inspired to me there must be a reason for that and then if there's something in your heart that can receive that there's a spirit in man and the inspiration of the almighty giveth them understanding he said great men are not always wise neither do the aides to understand judgment therefore I said hearken to me I also will show my opinion oh we found that out lately in our country last two presidents been the oldest president but I challenge you to find anybody who said they were the wisest now maybe some of you but eliu is a type of Christ again and so he's interceding in this way and if you watch he doesn't condemn job but what does he do he points out he points out and he kind of lays a platform for what God speaks to job directly in the next chapter but there is value in age there is a value to that sometimes a person that's older can tell you some things in fact most of the time brother Branham talked about Tommy Osborne and I don't have time to go into all of it but Tommy Osborne was a young preacher and he heard brother Branham in those Portland meetings those powerful meetings where the man fell across brother around his feet you can find Tommy Osborne's testimony of those meetings on the internet on YouTube and Tommy Osborne was never a message believer but he was a he was one of the preeminent evangelists of that day and so he uh but he was a young man and he saw this happen and he comes to brother Brandon he says can I have a gift of healing but the random discourages him from that he said those things are god-given he said but every preacher is called to lay hands on the sick and so he told Tommy Osborne he said what I'd do he said is set up there under that old oak tree and learn all the tactics of Divine Healing by the word so in other words if I was going to go have healing meetings and I didn't have a gift of a prophet right it wouldn't mean I couldn't do it because we're all called to lay hands on the sick right but but he said sit under that old oak tree and learn to tell you he said well why didn't you just tell him to read his Bible because there was something that old oak tree had experienced what happens when the Bible when the word become reality right that old oak tree had not only seen the scripture that said I'm the god that heals all thy diseases but he'd seen those diseases healed and he knew how to transfer God that's what experience and wisdom is it's it's the understanding how to translate from the writing from the book into real life it's one thing to have it in the book book learning will only take you so far but there's another thing to actually know this is where it says I'm Healed but how do I get from A to B how do I do that that picks experience right and so and so he said go let's sit under that oak tree he said what old oak tree I said that one that's bald headed up there on the porch oh Dr FF Bosworth he said I believe he knows more about scriptural basis of Divine Healing than any man I know of in my life and so brother Tommy Osborne does that and and he goes overseas he has great campaigns and he comes back and tells brother Brandon he said brother Branham he said I'm glad I said under that old oak tree I said do you know he said it's still setting out there he said so now you've had great campaigns but you need to go back and learn some more he's I said he's going to Africa with me brother boss worth was right there at the time now am I boring you yet I hope I'm not there's some good stuff here but I've got to get to it and I'm trying to lay this Foundation because I it's just something I get to do as a pastor so you all humor me this morning so the term Elder is used in the New Testament for men like brother Bosworth right men older men who also had wisdom by their age not by just their age but their age in the Lord in first Timothy 5 and 1 it says rebuke not an elder but entreat him as a father and the younger man is Brethren so in other words it's not that he's never wrong but when he's wrong there's a way to approach him right and and so now again that word Elder is is presbyteros which is older Elder presbyter a leader whose authority comes in principle from wisdom associated with age but it became the the head of the church or what we would call today the pastor become known as the pastor and it's used both ways in in the New Testament but Brown said Elder always has and always will refer simply to a man's chronological age in the Lord he is an elder not because he is elected or ordained Etc but because he is older right he is more seasoned trained not a novice reliable because of his experience now watch his experience and long-standing proof of his Christian experience so when you elect a pastor just in case you ever have to do it again you don't elect him to be an elder you elect an elder and that don't mean he's old right but it's his age in the Lord does he have a track record right what and what do you do with that track record you don't elect him to be an elder you don't make him an elder by electing him you elect an elder First Timothy three and one said this is a true saying if a man desire the office of a bishop there's another name for the same for the office for the Bible said the bishop was the office the Elder was who who held the office Bishop is the office of the Elder he said if he desires the office of a bishop he desires a good work and it goes on to give the qualifications I won't go through that this morning but in verse 6 it says not a novice less being lifted up with pride he fall into condemnation of the devil what does the word novice mean now we've got young preachers here but they're not novices novice means newly planted what that means is a new Christian don't make a new Christian an elder a pastor and we could take it into this this sense don't seek counsel on on spiritual things from brand new Christians now if you want to ask them how they got their fire lit that's wonderful when you're talking about the word and how to overcome and those things talk to some of these men that have been doing it for decades talk to some of the even the young people that have been raised up in church and know and believe these things got saved at a young age so it's not not a newly planted man see a newly converted 70 year old man is an office right a 30 year old man who gave his heart to the Lord at a young age might be an elder right so that's not and brother Brown talks about it I don't have time again I've deleted a bunch of quotes today just to kind of just to kind of get through this but uh brother Brown talks about a man be one night in the bar and the next night singing in church and playing music he said you don't do that he calls it filth filth because you don't just you don't just do that but you watch somebody's life and see where they're at and what they're able to do are you with me this morning hey man do you love the Lord this morning hey man now again be careful how much advice you get from the newly planted find an elder to talk to you talked to somebody just got married they're going to give you advice on marriage but it's not going to be the same advice you get from somebody's been married 40 years right and they do have advice to give but they're not going to have that depth of experience because they haven't been through as much right but you talked some of these people have been married 50 and 60 years my hat's off to you number one you lasted a long time to have been married for 60 years you've been on the earth a long time but if you if you've been married that long and uh Bill and sister Karen aren't here this morning but they they understand that some of you Elders you've been married a long time more than 50 years in some cases more than 60. you know that marriage is hard and you know what it's like to get past completely past the age of romance to the point where you're old and you're just taking care of each other and there's nothing in it for you you're just doing it for that other person but that's the best time there is because at some point you've got to reach that point where even when you're young it would be good to reach that point you're not doing it to get something you're doing it because you love that person so you get up and fix the breakfast in the morning or or help them out with the children or do whatever and vice versa and you're just barely able to get together forgive me brother JT but I know it takes you a while to get ready for church on Sunday morning and and I've thought about that you know it's an ordeal for some of the older folks to get ready and come to church and drive an hour to church and and be at the house of God it takes time and it would be a lot less effort just not do it let's just stream today but but they do it why do they do it because they want to set a good example and because they want to be in the house of the Lord right that's true yeah we ought to we ought to applaud people to do that some of you some of you have been through some things you it's hard for you to get out of bed in the morning physically maybe mentally but you come anyway why do you come oh God as I said Wednesday night that shows that you're a fish you got caught in the net and you weren't you didn't crawl back in the ocean you're a fish but you have a different perspective on life from somebody that that's Young and the young people have a different perspective because they're struggling with the kids right and they got a different perspective than you but you you've been there and done that but now you're fighting a different battle aren't you glad God's with you in that part of your battle too but so we don't want to get all of our advice from the newly planted we want to find an elder to talk to and whatever it is that we're seeking advice for after Solomon's Reign the people were upset about taxes that's happened all through history by the way people have always been mad about taxes and some of you are still mad about taxes I am too I'm right there with you I'm still paying off my taxes from last year now rehoboam asked his advisors remember who rehoboam is that's Solomon's son and I've been studying as you can tell from First Kings and second Kings and if you go into that and you begin to look at it he asked his advisors now he asked the men the old men now the reason why they had good advice is because they had been with Solomon his father they've been through it they didn't have good advice just because they were old but because they've been through the battle and that he asked the men that stood he said how should I answer the people and they spoken to him said if I love this answer if thou will be a servant unto this people these people are hurting these people have been over taxed Solomon overtaxed them to build the temple they got to the point where they'd just been worked like slaves because Solomon's building his house he's building the Temple he's building up Jerusalem he's got and there's always a price to pay somebody pays the price you come to church you go to a church and everything runs just smoothly and everything's so nice and the music you don't see what goes on behind the scenes to get it that way somebody made a sacrifice somebody put out some effort and so here these people would put out some effort and they hit the new pastor we could say the new king comes in and the old older men tell him said if you'll be a servant and we'll serve them and answer them and speak good words to them they will be thy servants forever just treat them right rehoboam that's wisdom talking but he wouldn't ask his young friends he said he forsook the counsel of the old men which they had given him and consulted with the young men that were grown up with him which stood before him he said unto them what council gives you that we may answer this people who have spoken to me saying make the Yoke which thy father did put Upon Us lighter and the young men that were growing up with him speaking to him saying thus shalt thou speak unto this people that spake unto thee the father thy father made our yoke heavy but make it thou eat lighter unto us thus shalt thou say unto them my little fingers shall be thicker than my father's loins what an expression he said now whereas my father did laid you with a heavy yoke I will add to your yoke loins was the strength of a man he's saying that he's saying I'm going to be heavier and stronger and and make you pay more taxes and be a harder disciplinarian than he was he said thy father made our yoke heavy even make it lighter I my little finger will be thicker than my father's voice now whereas my father delayed you with a heavy yoke I will add to your yoke my father had chastised you with whips but I will chastise you with scorpions imagine getting up and preaching that sermon he didn't have the heart of the people he was new right it was terrible advice and he lost 10 of the 12 tribes over it why did he take that advice though the advice of the elders because he'd grown up with these other men we got to be careful with that who do you want to ask for advice a Godly person amen the Bible says the thoughts of the righteous are right but the councils of the wicked are deceit the Bible says again in Psalms 1 1 blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly and that doesn't mean walk in a council c-o-u-n-c-i-l his counsel walketh not in the advice of the ungodly right nor standeth in the way of Sinners nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful you don't walk under the advice of the ungodly look look at ahaziah's counselors as I is again the king that we talked about that went down to be else above this is how Italia came to be the wicked Queen over Jerusalem it says 42 years old with a has I when he began to Reign he reigned one year in Jerusalem his mother's name was Italian the daughter of Omri remember they had married in intermarried between Judah and Israel said he walked in the ways of the House of Ahab for his mother was his counselor to do wickedly now we're coming back to the home and you think about it who is the best counselor and who can be the worst counselor the parents because they get all that time to spend with their children and tell them this is the right way and not just tell them but by actions show them what to do and what not to do his mother was his counselor to do wickedly wherefore he did evil in the sight of the Lord like the house of Ahab for they were his counselors after the death of his father to his destruction he walked also after their counsel and went with johoram the son of Ahab king of Israel the war against Hazel king of Syria Ramos Gilead and the syrians smote joram and he returned to be healed in jestro because of the wounds which were given him at Rhema and it tells the story and I I'm not going to read that next verse but it tells how because of that God used that occasion to cut off his house to cut off the house of Ahab be careful The Company You Keep be careful who you seek advice from but man who can I trust now let's bring it down a little bit closer as we get close to the end to this morning who can I trust and trust God that may seem simple but you can trust God look when when God came and expressed himself in flesh there were certain attributes that he was to be known by and those were expressed in Isaiah 9 6 where he says For unto us a child is born unto us a son is given it's telling what he will be and now it's going to give his attributes of his divine nature that he had right these things come from God right and they were in him so you know that there was Jehovah crying in the manger and I won't go into the godhead this morning but if he wasn't God till later he wouldn't have been these things as a child but he was these things unto us a child is born unto us a son is given the government will be all upon his shoulder and his name Shall be Called wonderful counselor do you ever notice that it was just pick that out counselor oh God his name should be called and actually the King James puts a a comma there but if you look in some of the other translations they remove the comma because in the original it's one word wonderful counselor oh God wonderful counselor his name should be called wonderful counselor the Mighty God the Everlasting father that shows you that there's no three persons in the Trinity right there his name shall be Everlasting father the Prince of Peace wonderful counselor literally means a Wonder of a counselor a Wonder of a counselor the Hebrew word for wonderful indicates a phenomenon laying outside the realm of human explanation do you want to know who to talk to today and I'll help you all that I can I want to be a good pastor as long as God allows me to be here I want to be the best that I can be but don't you realize there's somebody you can go to that don't make any mistakes that never never messes up talk to me long enough you'll hear something that's wrong if I talk to you long enough I'll hear something that's wrong because you're a human being but he's a wonderful counselor a counselor Beyond explanation all that's who we need to go to today that's why we need the spirit of God in our services that's why we need him to be so present Among Us a wonderful counselor a Wonder of a counselor Beyond human explanation separated from the normal course of events when I would go one way but the spirit of God convicts me and pulls me back another Direction beyond my explanation beyond what I can figure out he's a wonderful counselor and sometimes he uses men to do that but it's his counsel now listen the Bible speaking of not of of Wonder like that Wonder wonderful Beyond human explanation in Psalms 139 6 it explains that such knowledge is too wonderful for me it's too high I cannot attain unto it this is not something I thought up he's a wonderful counselor this goes into the realm of the supernatural it goes beyond my human abilities and my human thinking you say well I want a pastor who can explain everything to me just try it and and I want to be that but listen no man is going to be able to do that perfectly but you do have an advocate with the father you do have the Mighty God that's been unveiled before us you do have the Holy Spirit in your life to be able to talk to you and that knowledge that he gives is beyond your understanding you can't dream that up we wouldn't dream that we'd been here today we'd have made the Rapture a lot quicker but the wonderful counselor had different advice think about it if you could have controlled everything in your own life you wouldn't be where you're at today and you might think it's a mistake for you to be at where you're at today oh God help us today you might think it's a mistake oh I made a mistake I I feel like I feel like I'm not comfortable but you don't realize that God puts you where you're at why it was his advice that put you there that lets you go through the things that you went through it's beyond your understanding you were sitting there one day he said now let me give you some counsel we'll we'll talk about this and no no but by your War by his word and he led you and by his Spirit he led you and he led you in ways that were incomprehensible to your own mind you would not have picked the route that it took to get here are you with me now very few people could look back in life and say well I I I wish I I don't see anything to correct but we can look back and say I wish I hadn't done that and I wish I hadn't gone there and I wish I hadn't started over this place and I wish I hadn't done made this mistake and I wish I hadn't made that commitment but don't you realize the wonderful counselor knew better than you did about your life and brought you to the place where you are today beyond your explanation beyond your ability to think about it said but I don't understand I had this sickness in my body and these things have happened to me and now I find myself in a different place wonderful counselor advised differently than what you would have advised are you with me now the Bible tells us that that's the Holy Spirit John 16 and 12 says I have yet many things to say unto you do you believe he's still speaking today Jesus told him he said I have many things to say unto you but you cannot bear them now he wanted to tell him about a Rapture he wanted to tell him oh my you want to tell him about all these things that Paul all these Revelations that the message of grace to the Gentiles we said you can't bear that now I would tell you these things you can't bear that now how be it when he the spirit of Truth has come he will guide you into all truth for he shall not speak of himself now I like this a real counselor is humble right if you find somebody that has all the answers you run a real counselor is humble he shall not speak of himself but whatsoever he shall hear that shall he speak he will show you things to come likewise the spirit also helpeth our infirmities I love this Romans 8 26 the spirit also helpeth our infirmities for we know not what we should pray for as we ought we know what we want but we don't always know what he wants right and many times in the word we'll look at it and we and we say well where is the word that fits my situation where you can't see it without the Holy Spirit so he has to reveal that to you and so the spirit helps our infirmities or our weaknesses for we don't know what we should pray for but the spirit wonderful counselor remember all that God was he poured into Christ all that Christ was he poured into the church in the form of the Holy Spirit right he's a wonderful counselor is that what he is so now he makes intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered and he that searcheth the hearts knoweth what is the mind of the spirit because he maketh intercession for the Saints according to the will of God somebody tell me what another name for a counselor is an attorney if you said attorney Pat yourself on the back if you can if you ever I can't so if you've ever if you've ever been in a court of law you know that that's how they address them in the court of law counselor counselor why they talk because they're there to advise the client they're not on trial they're there to advise the client but brother Branham comes along in the message of the hour and he tells us he said we need a counselor we need an attorney complete our case he said but actually the attorney and the judge amen it's a rigged Court they're the same person so the attorney gives you the right advice gives you the right words to testify gives you the things to say and tells you your innocent tells you you didn't do it in the first place tells you you're clean tells you your whole tells you you've been forgiven by the blood of the Lamb the attorney is speaking on your behalf he's a wonderful counselor oh my he's a wonderful counselor he shows you things to come he tells you this is what the judge does how can he know that he is the judge this is what pleases the judge how does he know that he is the judge Glory he knows what the judge wants yeah you think about a good attorney he don't just care about about what he has to say about just talking but he cares about everything even the appearance in the courtroom this judge he likes his people to wear a tie this judge he likes to be spoken to in a certain way I'm not saying that about God by the way you can wear a tie or not I want to start that Doctrine but you know he knows what the judge wants he's got it in his mind why he has familiarity but oh how much more our wonderful counselor knows what pleases the judge so he says this is how you should walk before him have you ever been convicted when you say something that was wrong you'd say something maybe a sharp to somebody and you feel that that conviction come over you what is that your wonderful counselor right he's coming to you he's beginning to talk to you and he's telling you don't say that don't write that don't type that don't don't send that letter or email or whatever it is you because that wonderful counselor what does he do he comes in and he begins to talk to you oh we'd be so much better off if we would listen to The Counselor if we'd listen to the attorney but that wonderful counselor comes in and tells us how does he know he is the judge he said the judge likes you to be at peace with one another the judge likes you to have Fellowship the judge wants you to be at peace in your home how does he know he is the judge Hallelujah and and again it doesn't mean that he won't ever use a teacher because brother Branham says that's his method he said we must come under teaching but the Holy Ghost Jesus men but remember it's the Holy Ghost not the man can I have five more minutes it's been I've been up here 55 minutes just in case you were wondering Joe Ash you remember looked up to Jehovah Diane when Jehovah passed away then he didn't know what to do Isaiah looked up to Uzziah in the same way it's backwards it was the prophet looking up to the king and he had to come to a time in his life that he realized there was a wonderful counselor that was Far Beyond his friend's uziah which had been a friendship of many years because I wasn't a young man by the way when he made his mistake there come a time you had to let go of that leadership and have an experience with God are you listening to me this morning you need to have an experience with God at some point you need you're going to have to let go of all human leadership and come face to face with God it doesn't mean again it makes you more willing to listen not less you'll still seek advice but you all the counsel in the world that I could give or other men or Elders could give to you would never help unless you've been in the presence of God because you won't follow the word your flesh doesn't want to unless you've been in the presence of God now watch second chronicles 26 tells the story of King Uzziah I won't read it all but the Bible says his name spread far abroad he'd done all of these things second chronicles 26 15 his name spread far abroad for he was marvelously helped till he was strong but when he was strong his heart was lifted up to his destruction for he transgressed against the Lord his God and went into the Temple of the Lord to burn incense upon the altar of incense without asking any advice and without having that wonderful counselor Uzziah walked into the holy of holies and Azariah the priest went in after him that was his job and with him four score Priests of the Lord 80 priests that were Valiant men and they withstood inside of the king and said unto him in appertaineth not disease to burn incense unto the Lord haven't we seen what a mess it makes when businessmen invade the pulpit when people get out of their position right they weren't meant to do that don't go in there uziah you're a king not a preacher not a priest he said but 80 men stood against him but the he said it appertains not unto thee to burn any sense of the Lord but to the priests of Sons of Heron are consecrated to burn incense go out of the sanctuary for thou has trespassed can you imagine a priest trying to kick a king out of church he said but you don't belong in that position so you've given such bad advice you're setting such a bad example you got out of position huh oh God help us today and it says go out of the sanctuary you've trespassed neither shall be for thine honor from the Lord God then uziah was wroth and he had a sensor in his hand to burn incense and while he was Wrath with the priest while he was angry leprosy even rose up in his forehead before the priest in the house of the Lord from beside the incense altered leprosy is a type of Sin Sin come in his life and Azariah the chief priest and all the priests looked upon him and behold he was leprous in his forehead and they thrust him out from this yay himself hasted also to go out because the Lord had smitten him brother Brandon said when this man got lifted got stricken by the celebrities he got lifted up in Pride it was a great lesson to the prophet Isaiah he found out by this being a great lesson that God orders his man to the place man cannot order himself God orders his man is that right he's a wonderful counselor God makes you what you are God orders this man and he mustn't try to take another's place and it was a lesson to Isaiah he mustn't put his eyes upon human beings for an example he must put his eyes on God oh that's us this morning listen to what the prophet said he said now that's us we can Pitchfork over to somebody else but that's us this morning any man any man is subject to mistakes he is subject to error because he is human he is subject to the violations of God's laws he is subject to many things because Satan tempts him he is just a human being and if God ever lifted his hands he would fall and I've heard people say oh Satan can't do that yes you just let God lift his hand one time and Watch What Happens he said I constantly plead God don't send him have mercy on me oh shouldn't that be our call today and our desire to have the humility to ask for that counsel from God lord don't lift your hand off my life keep them away from me I need God's mercy he said we all need that Brandon I'm skipping past one here he said don't ever trust in some man I don't care who he is if he's a holy man if he's good there's no such thing he said there's no holy man there's no holy church there's no such thing it's a holy God not a holy man it's the Holy Ghost he said it's the Holy Spirit working in the man it's the holy God in the church he goes on he said the man will fail he's a failure to begin with anybody the very greatest of man fall don't never put your confidence to make some man your example look to God Christ is your example make sure that one of your many counselors is the awesome wonderful counselor are you with me now make sure he's a counselor and he's the main one amen he said God he said we finally taking his mind from his eye the king that he loves so well now watch he said Christ is your example he said the king that he loves so well from Uzziah he said he looked up and he saw what he must understand to be a prophet that God and God Alone rules in the lives of men and in his church Isaiah 6. that's what God wants to show us today God and God Alone rules in the lives of men and in his church and if you go to Isaiah 6 1 and I don't have time to go through all of it as I'm closing this morning in fact musicians can go ahead and come and and we'll pick it up and then take it a different direction tonight but in Isaiah 6 and 1 it says in the year that King Uzziah died I saw also the Lord sitting upon a throne high and lifted up what was God showing him here was Josiah taken down off his throne smitten with leprosy but now he comes into the vision in the house of the Lord he's so desperate to hear a word from God because this has happened and it's troubled his mind but brother random said he showed God showed him a vision he showed him he put him in his presence he took him right up to the throne room and he looked in the throne room and he saw not a man lifted up not a preacher not a song leader not a prophet but the Mighty God the king the Lord sitting upon a throne I enlisted up elevated above everything else oh that's what we want to make him today we want to lift him up we want to elevate him over everything he said in his train I've never noticed this before but it said his train filled the temple is trained filled the temple I've looked at that but I've wondered what was the point his train filled the temple think about it his clothing filled the temple there was no room for anybody else we've got to come to this place Church we're surrendered to him and then when we can see the holy ghost moving a man will listen to the man because it's the Holy Ghost and a man the holy ghost that let him have that experience the holy ghost that made him an elder the Holy Ghost in our wives are you with me the Holy Ghost and the mothers teaching the younger women that's what the Bible tells them to do the Holy Ghost and among us teaching one another well what is it it's the Holy Ghost there is no room for anyone else in the throne room of God there is no room for anybody else but God oh God the Bible says who have known the mind of the Lord who has been his counselor what was missing from that throne room every Earthly King is surrounded by counselors because they understood that they needed men who knew who knew about the economy men who knew about they needed a cabinet they needed a a privy Council they needed somebody that they could trust that would be on the inside of the inside they could tell them about the economy tell them about war prop them up because no man knows everything and so those Eastern Kings would have hundreds of counselors hundreds of counselors in fact when King Charles was had his head cut off by the English people his wife he brought from France she brought a thousand counselors the queen brought a thousand counselors from France to be a queen you think how many more the king had think about it they filled the place wherever you saw King his house was full the the palace was full but here was God in the temple of the Lord and his train filled the temple no room for any other counselors we don't generate counsel from the flesh we want counsel to come from the Lord amen because he knows what's in his mind you're on his mind he knows you he was there with you before you were born go ahead and start playing something if you would brother Brown tells you a story about an old guide you forgive me today I'm tired I I've done that to myself that's not your fault I I I'm physically mentally wore out but I just it just means so much to me when I begin to look into these things so I know it's been choppy but there was an old guide who was taking a man fishing he was taking him out in the ocean of course you know in the ocean it's scary at night they took him out early in the morning before the sun come up and he took him out and he said they just kept drifting towards the ocean slowly they kept drifting as the ocean pulled and the currents and the tide began to pull them out and and the man that was with him that was with the guy that was fishing brother said it was a it was a doctor that wanted to go fishing in the ocean and he said he began to get nervous and began to say well I I don't we need to go back in we need to use the ores we need to use the engine we're going to get lost out here we're going to be out in the middle of the ocean when he said he said wait your God had done this before he said just wait what was he waiting on brother said he's waiting on the sun to come up he said because in the light we'll know where we're at amen this wonderful counselor has come in our age and the sun has come up have we not been preaching on that on Wednesday nights is that not what brother Randall told us in this arising of the Sun in the rising it dispels all the Gloom and we know where we're at oh my you want counsel today you can find it in the message of the hour you can find it in the word of God why because he's a wonderful counselor and he come in our age to show us hey this is where you're at you've not drifted too far you can't fall you were with God in his mind before the foundation of the Earth aren't you glad for that today you're glad you got a great counselor don't get nervous don't get discouraged if you've never met him today never met that great counselor the holy spirit with your head bowed and your eyes closed all the counseling in the world will never help never met him eat him today would you would you be willing to do that could you go in his throne maybe you need a refilling of the Holy Ghost draw yourself now into the throne room [Music] and see him high and lifted up and be touched by a coal of fire off the altar let him be your wonderful counselor today and he'll he'll do it and you won't even know how it got done but somehow you'll have peace and you'll have joy you'll have strength and it'll help your family and help your life is that wonderful counselor is there Heavenly Father Lord Jesus with these that are gathered here together Lord they they need that counsel they need that strength in their lives oh god oh Lord how we would we would reach down to each one of them if we could and help but Lord sometimes we don't know the words to say sometimes we don't stay away and I know there's many others like me that sometimes we don't stay away or refrain from talking because because we don't want to help but because we we know we don't have the right words we just don't know what to say but Lord when we enter your throne room we realize there is a wonderful counselor or that can reach down to the one who's been through the most and empathize with them a high priest that can be touched by the feeling of our infirmity I pray you'd help us to realize that today to recognize that if there's one here who's never received the baptism of the Holy Ghost I pray Lord that you'd help them not to rest until they had completely wrapped themselves Lord in your spirit that had come down on that seed and anointed it hard in such a way that it would come to life or if there's one that needs a refilling today Lord my hands are up today I need strength I need guidance Lord I pray you'd come this morning refill it so God make us put a fire in us to burn Lord and do the things that are right I prayed granted now we love you Lord forgive us of our mistakes forgive us where we've listened to the wrong counseling the ungodly people or or to an ungodly Hollywood or something that that set our frame of mind oh God
