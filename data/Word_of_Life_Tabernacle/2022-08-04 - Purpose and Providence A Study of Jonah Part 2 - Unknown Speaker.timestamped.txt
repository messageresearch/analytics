[42:33] also we'll read from Jonah chapter 1 and
[42:35] verse 3. Second Kings 14 25 and Jonah 1
[42:40] and 3 while you're turning there happy
[42:43] birthday to Jason Jason is 10 years old
[42:47] today
[42:48] [Applause]
[42:52] you ready to preach
[42:57] just a couple more years you'd be
[42:59] preaching age so so glad to have the the
[43:02] Pruitt family with us and it was a Joel
[43:05] and his family and it's such a been such
[43:07] a blessing to us and all of you I
[43:09] understand uh brother matinee has been
[43:12] talking about being baptized and what a
[43:13] blessing that'll be and maybe do that on
[43:16] a Sunday and each one of you uh your
[43:19] families it means so much to us we see
[43:21] these little children come up what a
[43:23] great responsibility it is to teach to
[43:25] them the word and to live the word to
[43:28] our children amen amen God bless you
[43:31] turn me back down just a little bit I
[43:33] know I'm talking low but I've got a
[43:34] little ringing Second Kings 14 25 He
[43:37] restored the coast of Israel from the
[43:40] entering of hammeth Unto the Sea of the
[43:42] plain according to the word of the Lord
[43:45] God of Israel which he spake by the hand
[43:48] of his servant Jonah the son of amitai
[43:51] the Prophet which was of gath heifer so
[43:55] you find Jonah having a great prophecy
[43:58] and a season in his ministry when it was
[44:01] received and believed by the king and
[44:04] there was a great Victory actually over
[44:06] the Assyrians during that time
[44:09] Jonah chapter 1 and verse 3 we have a
[44:11] very different picture
[44:13] it says but Jonah rose up to flee into
[44:15] tarshish from the presence of the Lord
[44:19] and went down to Joppa and he found a
[44:21] ship going to tarshish
[44:23] so we paid the fare thereof and went
[44:26] down into it to go with them to tarshish
[44:30] from the presence
[44:32] of the Lord let's bow our heads together
[44:34] for a word of Prayer
[44:36] I want to continue talking about Jonah
[44:38] and what he meant as a prophet and the
[44:41] type
[44:42] that he is to us Heavenly Father Lord we
[44:46] thank you for all the the things that
[44:48] you've given us thank you for a church
[44:50] that we can gather in on a Wednesday
[44:51] night and hear your word Lord and it
[44:55] means so much to us to be able to be
[44:57] here I pray God that you'd move in every
[44:59] life this evening I pray that you'd
[45:02] speak in every heart and every situation
[45:04] to every couple and every family Lord to
[45:08] the pastor and the ministers and each
[45:10] one of us oh God we pray that you just
[45:12] Lord speak what we need tonight and help
[45:16] us Lord that we would receive from your
[45:18] word not from a man but Lord may we
[45:20] receive the word of God May It Grow Lord
[45:23] and bring forth fruit in the hour that
[45:25] we've been planted in we pray that you
[45:27] would do it heal the sick Lord touch
[45:29] each and every one those that are here
[45:31] and those that could not be we pray and
[45:33] we ask it in Jesus name amen God bless
[45:37] you you can be seated
[45:42] if you listen to a sermon titled Souls
[45:46] that are in prison now that brother
[45:48] Branham preached in 1963
[45:51] well the Branham talks about how a
[45:54] prophet's Ministry has three poles to it
[45:57] and the third poll is to the Eternal law
[46:00] so he notices a pattern in scripture of
[46:04] a prophet having three poles and the
[46:07] third poll seemingly it's to those who
[46:10] don't want to hear it
[46:12] and uh and we find that that's true uh
[46:15] even in in Jonah's Ministry and we'll
[46:17] show it in just a moment and we can see
[46:20] that and but if you go back to where
[46:22] brother Branham talks about the three
[46:23] polls the poll you understand is a he's
[46:27] fishing
[46:28] right he's fishing and so he cast out
[46:31] into the deep water and he said the
[46:34] first pull you'd pull it slow and of
[46:37] course you know as a fisherman that
[46:39] that's what you would do you'd pull it
[46:40] slow he said and then you pull it away
[46:43] from the little fish to attract the
[46:45] attention of bigger fish so in each poll
[46:48] the first time it attracts the minnows
[46:51] and and so then he said you pull it the
[46:53] second time a little harder and when you
[46:55] pull it the second time it attracts a
[46:58] little bit bigger class of fish but then
[47:01] on the third pole that's when you set
[47:03] the hook because that's the fish that
[47:05] you wanted to catch if with the third
[47:08] pole so there's something there to catch
[47:10] but they may not be as many a number but
[47:13] the quality is better
[47:14] right and you find that in brother
[47:16] random's Ministry that in the first poll
[47:18] there were so many crowds and and
[47:20] miracles that were done what was it he
[47:23] was throwing it out in the deep water
[47:24] among the people and the people were
[47:26] attracted to that gift and then in the
[47:28] second poll it moved a little faster and
[47:30] some began to fall away but then in the
[47:33] third poll many left him just like that
[47:35] many left Jesus when he said eat my
[47:38] flesh and drink my blood because he's
[47:40] jerking it really hard but there had to
[47:42] be somebody that stayed and I want to be
[47:45] one of those who stayed for the word
[47:46] aren't you glad that you didn't you
[47:49] didn't just go with the Miracles but you
[47:51] stayed with the word
[47:52] you stayed for the word and so the 70
[47:55] left even though they were men that that
[47:58] had preached Jesus message in the first
[48:01] poll in the second poll but when it come
[48:04] down to the third poll they couldn't
[48:05] couldn't see themselves preaching that
[48:08] so they could not excuse me face up to
[48:11] the responsibility of preaching a third
[48:13] pole message they said we don't know
[48:15] what he's talking about he's a Vampire
[48:17] the law tells us not to eat these things
[48:20] and not to eat the blood with the meat
[48:23] with the blood and so they left him they
[48:24] didn't understand what he was talking
[48:26] about but Peter didn't understand it
[48:29] either with his head but he said to whom
[48:31] would we go
[48:32] right we're here for the duration aren't
[48:35] you glad you can do that tonight say I'm
[48:37] here for the duration I I belong with
[48:40] this message we I've left all to follow
[48:42] you Lord
[48:43] amen
[48:45] so Jonah's early Ministry if you could
[48:48] call it his first and his second poll
[48:50] they they attracted uh great attention
[48:53] he had a great thing going but he knew
[48:56] that his third pole Ministry would be
[48:58] difficult
[49:00] and brother Branham tells us that Noah's
[49:02] Ministry was that way and in fact he
[49:04] says in souls are in prison now he said
[49:06] all Ministries
[49:07] done the same
[49:09] so Nineveh in the big picture was a type
[49:14] of God's mercy to the Gentiles
[49:17] and so we see again at the end of the
[49:19] Gentile age there had to be a prophet
[49:22] with a third pull Ministry
[49:25] and during that third poll Ministry the
[49:29] the as the as The Lure is being pulled
[49:32] as the attraction moves the attraction
[49:35] begins begins with a big group but it
[49:38] ends up only being for the elect only
[49:40] the elect will be attracted to the third
[49:43] poll and what is the third poll the
[49:45] opening of the word
[49:47] that's what brother Brandon said it was
[49:48] so only the elect is attracted to that
[49:51] but see Jonah couldn't see and if you
[49:54] watch that sermon when brother Brandon
[49:55] preached Souls that are in prison now he
[49:58] wasn't sure if it wasn't all over
[50:00] if there was even hope for his own
[50:02] children and you you look at Jonah
[50:04] facing that same thing he didn't know if
[50:06] it wasn't all over what's the point of
[50:08] going and preaching in Nineveh and he
[50:11] couldn't face up to the responsibility
[50:13] of a third pull Ministry
[50:15] but aren't you glad our Prophet did
[50:18] amen and so now here it's only for a
[50:24] certain group and Jonah Jonah couldn't
[50:26] face up to that now the third poll would
[50:29] be different In Jonah one and two he
[50:32] said arise go to Nineveh
[50:34] he said that great City and cry against
[50:36] it for their wickedness has come up
[50:40] before me
[50:42] now he didn't tell him he didn't tell
[50:44] Jonah well they'll repent
[50:46] they're all getting sackcloth and Ashes
[50:48] and I'll give them an extension of Mercy
[50:50] he didn't reveal that to Jonah he just
[50:53] said go cry against it
[50:55] oh my and Jonah couldn't face up to
[50:58] doing that
[50:59] and brother Branham said in a message
[51:01] called a man running from the presence
[51:04] of the Lord he said the reason the
[51:07] principal reason that I believe that he
[51:09] did this great thing again there could
[51:12] be many reasons that he did it we
[51:13] explored some of those last Wednesday
[51:15] but the principal reason that he did
[51:18] this was because Jonah was a Jew and he
[51:21] was asked to go to a gentile City to cry
[51:24] against it thinking he would not be
[51:26] received
[51:28] because the Gentiles would think what's
[51:30] just you got to do with us
[51:32] but you see he said another thing it
[51:34] gives us a great thing here to see that
[51:36] God not only is God of the Jew but he's
[51:38] got also the Gentile
[51:40] he's God of all people and so we talked
[51:42] about that last Wednesday night that
[51:44] God's got a pocket full of change he
[51:46] he's got different kinds of people he
[51:49] said go preach to the elect go preach to
[51:51] the Nautilus go out in evangelism and we
[51:53] dealt with that how brother Branham
[51:54] wanted to go up into the woods and only
[51:56] come out and preach when when God said
[51:58] thus saith the Lord but he said you're
[52:00] not that kind of prophet
[52:03] right you've got a different Ministry
[52:05] said you have a higher Ministry than
[52:06] that and that's to be an Apostolic age
[52:09] he said in the apostolic age you're to
[52:11] be an evangelist do the work of an
[52:13] evangelist Go Out Among the people
[52:15] amen so not to run from your
[52:18] responsibility to the people oh how many
[52:20] times would we like to just get off to
[52:22] ourselves
[52:24] pull off in our own little little area
[52:26] and or maybe off into our own little
[52:28] church or maybe even into our own home
[52:31] and said just let the world go by it's
[52:34] all going going down anyway we're not
[52:36] going to make it only the elect anyway
[52:39] we might as well just quit
[52:41] but there has to be somebody
[52:43] to give a testimony to give a witness in
[52:47] the third poll
[52:48] when brother Brown was praying at the
[52:50] end of that sermon he's praying for the
[52:51] people he said even if it's all over he
[52:53] said let May there be a testimony of
[52:55] witness yes
[52:58] yes amen
[52:59] amen and so we're called to do that but
[53:02] I believe there's some big fish left too
[53:04] and brother Branham as he goes along he
[53:07] talks about that in that third poll we
[53:09] know we found out what's to the elect
[53:11] but also to the Eternal loss now watch
[53:14] because there's those out there who are
[53:16] already in hell
[53:18] and once you go there you can't come
[53:20] back
[53:22] who am I out of this realm
[53:24] there's a great goal fixed and brother
[53:26] Brandon said they created hell on Earth
[53:30] oh what a time we live in serious thing
[53:32] isn't it
[53:34] but now so he said that's why he would
[53:37] run from him because he's Gentiles who
[53:39] they were and who he was
[53:42] and he goes on he said here we find an
[53:44] example
[53:45] of all of us
[53:50] we're going to do some preaching tonight
[53:52] you just hang with me
[53:54] we find an example
[53:57] of us
[53:58] every one of us we're always are running
[54:03] from something yes
[54:06] we run from trouble we run from
[54:09] responsibilities
[54:10] watch that word responsibility it's
[54:12] important
[54:13] he said we're all prone to do that we're
[54:17] all prone to do that yeah all of us are
[54:20] he said we are more prone to run
[54:23] than we are to stand and face it out
[54:26] see we find ourselves running yes
[54:30] it's easier just to go along and so many
[54:33] times we find that in our Christian walk
[54:35] even the kids when they go to school you
[54:37] know maybe when they get there they'll
[54:38] they'll pray over their food but they
[54:40] see nobody else is and mommy and daddy
[54:42] aren't there to watch them and so it's
[54:44] easy it's even even at Melody's age and
[54:47] she's talked to me about it that it's
[54:49] easy to not pray over your food and
[54:51] because everybody else is not doing it
[54:53] so you begin to do it silently and then
[54:55] and then you end up not doing it at all
[54:56] because no one else is doing it and you
[54:59] know what I'm talking about my kids have
[55:01] all went through that and and because we
[55:03] would rather run from him than we would
[55:05] to face up to the criticism that we're
[55:07] going to face
[55:08] and the questions that we're going to
[55:10] face
[55:11] I've known message girls who would go to
[55:13] school and take off their skirts and put
[55:15] on pants because they couldn't face up
[55:18] to the criticism that they would take at
[55:20] school
[55:21] but I say as Christians today we as
[55:23] parents especially we need to be the
[55:25] example of that
[55:26] that we would stand up and and be an
[55:28] example of being in the public we've got
[55:31] to be in the public we can't pull off
[55:32] somewhere by ourselves we can't go run
[55:34] off and and come out of the woods
[55:36] somewhere if God wouldn't allow brother
[55:37] Branham to do it he's not going to allow
[55:39] us to do it we've got to be part of this
[55:41] world but while we're here let's be a
[55:44] Shining Light let's be a testimony of
[55:46] witness
[55:48] to a lost world
[55:51] maybe there's a big fish out there
[55:52] somewhere
[55:53] it's your testimony at school can make a
[55:55] difference too
[55:58] so he said we're prone to do that we
[56:00] just we find ourselves running
[56:04] oh how many times have I
[56:06] done that and I'm sure you could say
[56:07] Amen to that as well
[56:10] you know a prophet has responsibility
[56:12] that's the first thing I want to if
[56:14] you're keeping notes to stay awake
[56:15] tonight that's the first thing I want to
[56:17] talk about is a prophet's responsibility
[56:20] see a prophet is responsible to God
[56:24] and he's responsible to the people he
[56:26] preaches to but he's he's firstly
[56:29] responsible to God God told Isaiah he
[56:31] said cry aloud
[56:33] spare not lift up thy voice like a
[56:36] trumpet show my people their
[56:38] transgression in the house of Jacob
[56:40] their sins
[56:41] it's a responsibility
[56:44] and when brother Branham preaches a man
[56:46] running from the presence of the Lord
[56:47] he's called he's talking about his own
[56:49] Ministry but he didn't run
[56:53] because he's talking about the question
[56:54] of marriage and divorce and when brother
[56:57] Branham has those series of meetings
[56:58] that he begins on Wednesday night I
[57:01] believe it was with a man running from
[57:03] the presence of the Lord and Sunday
[57:04] morning he comes and preaches marriage
[57:06] and divorce he has avoided that most of
[57:09] his ministry
[57:10] stayed away from it especially in the
[57:12] public but he's got to face it because
[57:14] he knows he don't have much time left
[57:17] and so he's got to face it before he
[57:19] goes off the scene
[57:21] and so he's talking mostly about himself
[57:24] and when we know that because of some of
[57:26] the things that he said no he could have
[57:28] put it put it off and he could do that
[57:30] under the first pull and under the
[57:31] second pole but this the the elect had
[57:34] to hear that
[57:36] we had to face up to it
[57:39] there was a time where things like this
[57:40] didn't matter and I say to those who
[57:42] want to loosen up the pulpits today and
[57:44] make it where just anybody can can stand
[57:46] behind the pulpit anybody don't matter
[57:48] one way or the other this is the hour we
[57:50] have to face up to marriage and divorce
[57:52] yes sir this is the hour we've got to
[57:54] face up to clean living this is the hour
[57:56] face up to be in the bride of Christ
[58:00] it does matter we have a responsibility
[58:04] and so he had to face up to preaching
[58:07] that sermon that sermon that would be so
[58:09] hard on the women
[58:11] so hard on the preachers
[58:15] so hard on everybody
[58:17] but I've always looked at it like this
[58:18] people avoid listening to that but it
[58:21] was a message of Grace
[58:24] she was able to say stay as you are
[58:26] you've been forgiven but don't do that
[58:28] thing again
[58:30] but we've got to face up to that yeah
[58:32] right and many of you may have been
[58:33] impacted by that in your lives but we
[58:35] still have to face up to it it's the
[58:37] word it's the third poll all the loose
[58:39] sins have been tied up
[58:41] we don't have any excuse in this hour
[58:44] he told he told us he said teach your
[58:45] children not to do that
[58:48] so now
[58:49] he could put it off but now he has to
[58:51] stand up to it
[58:52] so what did Jonah have to do Jonah had
[58:54] to travel to a foreign land preach to
[58:56] Gentiles be rejected if the Gentiles
[58:59] received it Israel would reject him
[59:02] if the Israelites receive or if the
[59:05] Gentiles rejected it uh then or if the
[59:07] Israel was happy with him the Gentiles
[59:09] wouldn't be
[59:10] so he he knew there was no there's no
[59:12] way to win in this situation
[59:15] but yet he knew he had to do it
[59:17] but he just couldn't face up to it
[59:20] and how many of us have responsibilities
[59:24] that sometimes we don't want to face
[59:27] the brown said Moses had to do it Elijah
[59:29] had to do it every prophet in his age
[59:31] had to stand up and face these
[59:33] responsibilities many of them didn't do
[59:35] like Jonah he run they didn't
[59:38] aren't you glad for a prophet that
[59:39] didn't run
[59:41] he said John the Baptist was very
[59:42] unpopular in his age he cried out
[59:45] against his age he said to the king the
[59:46] Pope
[59:48] the post brother's wife he had to preach
[59:49] on marriage and divorce one morning see
[59:51] how he's typing into his own Ministry so
[59:54] he cried out against it he said it's not
[59:56] lawful for you to have her he said it
[59:57] cost him his head to be cut off later
[59:59] but he cried out and he stood to his
[1:00:01] post of Duty he never took a ship to
[1:00:03] tarshish and said well I'll agree with
[1:00:05] you Herod it's all right as long as you
[1:00:07] think she's a nice woman she's making
[1:00:08] you a nice wife go ahead
[1:00:10] he said oh mercy them dish Rags you see
[1:00:13] he said just every little thing he said
[1:00:15] wow it's nothing but the clean dirty
[1:00:16] plates with
[1:00:17] oh my but he said notice John wasn't
[1:00:19] that way he faced right up to it he said
[1:00:22] it's not lawful for you to have her and
[1:00:24] he stood out against it
[1:00:26] at some point we have to face
[1:00:27] responsibility
[1:00:30] Paul faced his responsibility I love
[1:00:32] Paul's Ministry because when he gets
[1:00:34] down to the end of it in Acts chapter 20
[1:00:37] and verse 26 he says wherefore I take
[1:00:40] you to record this day he said that I am
[1:00:43] pure from the blood of all men oh God
[1:00:45] help me to reach the end of my Ministry
[1:00:47] and be able to say the same thing I hope
[1:00:50] that I can I trust that I'll be able to
[1:00:51] but it'll only be by the grace of God
[1:00:54] because Paul said by the grace of God I
[1:00:56] am what I am
[1:00:57] but he said I'm not shunned to declare
[1:00:59] unto you all the counsel of God all the
[1:01:03] counsel of God brother Branham a couple
[1:01:05] of months after he preaches marriage and
[1:01:07] divorce there in February in April of
[1:01:09] that same year he said if you never hear
[1:01:11] my voice again he said but God willing
[1:01:13] I'm setting to Africa in a few hours I
[1:01:15] may never return I don't know but I tell
[1:01:17] you with all my heart I've told you the
[1:01:18] truth and he just spoke there under
[1:01:21] inspiration and spoken to Los Angeles
[1:01:23] and said it's going to sink
[1:01:25] he spoke in a Capernaum Capernaum he
[1:01:28] spoke him spoke to him something
[1:01:30] difficult he said I haven't shunned to
[1:01:33] declare to you everything that God has
[1:01:36] told me to say and brother gave my heart
[1:01:38] rejoiced when I heard that because I
[1:01:40] said we we have the benefit of going
[1:01:42] back and looking and reading and hearing
[1:01:45] a prophet that did not shun his his
[1:01:48] responsibility but he said I'm going to
[1:01:50] say what God told me to say yes why he
[1:01:53] had to do that because his ministry was
[1:01:55] to bring us back to Paul's Ministry
[1:01:58] amen he fulfilled his responsibility yes
[1:02:03] preachers have responsibilities
[1:02:06] and I'm going to preach it myself
[1:02:10] II Timothy 4 1 says I charge thee
[1:02:12] therefore before God Paul speaking to a
[1:02:15] younger Minister he said in the Lord
[1:02:17] Jesus Christ who shall judge the quick
[1:02:18] and the dead and his appearing in his
[1:02:20] kingdom preach the word it's a
[1:02:23] responsibility we have to face up to it
[1:02:25] to preach
[1:02:27] not only to preach but to be instant in
[1:02:30] season in other words to be ready to
[1:02:32] preach
[1:02:33] we have a responsibility to that
[1:02:35] be instant in season out of season when
[1:02:37] it's convenient when it's inconvenient
[1:02:40] reproof rebuke exhort
[1:02:43] with all long-suffering I love the way
[1:02:45] he does that love the way he does they
[1:02:47] said because he said you're going to
[1:02:48] have to reprove them sometimes you're
[1:02:50] going to have to rebuke but do it with
[1:02:51] long suffering and Doctrine make sure
[1:02:54] it's sound
[1:02:55] for the time will come and they will not
[1:02:57] endure sound Doctrine
[1:02:59] but to their own lust or their own
[1:03:01] desires so they Heap to themselves
[1:03:02] teachers having itching ears in other
[1:03:05] words there's things they want to hear
[1:03:06] and they're going to find somebody
[1:03:07] that's going to tell them what they want
[1:03:08] to hear that's why
[1:03:10] some preachers are so popular
[1:03:13] and I'm talking not about message
[1:03:15] preachers now but about those in the
[1:03:16] world that gain followings of thousands
[1:03:19] and thousands and thousands of people
[1:03:21] this message isn't popular if you preach
[1:03:23] it
[1:03:24] was right it's not popular I see people
[1:03:26] who well some people have big churches
[1:03:28] well compared to ours but
[1:03:30] maybe but I'd love to see this church
[1:03:33] filled up but this message will never be
[1:03:35] popular or there will never be mega
[1:03:36] churches all over the land that the
[1:03:39] president be espousing it if it does you
[1:03:41] better watch out
[1:03:42] huh something well bad will have
[1:03:45] happened I don't believe that'll ever
[1:03:46] happen because it's sound Doctrine
[1:03:50] they shall turn away their ears from the
[1:03:52] truth shall be turned unto fables he
[1:03:54] said but watch thou in all things endure
[1:03:57] afflictions do the work of an evangelist
[1:03:59] make full proof of thy Ministries over
[1:04:01] the Branham not only had to face up to a
[1:04:03] prophet's responsibility but a
[1:04:05] preacher's responsibility
[1:04:06] it's not just a prophet it was a new
[1:04:08] testament preacher and a preacher has a
[1:04:11] responsibility to the people
[1:04:13] sometimes I don't want to face that
[1:04:15] brother Joe and usually you know I like
[1:04:17] to preach I'll just be honest with you
[1:04:19] brother Charlie Cox used to tell us that
[1:04:21] he said you preachers say you don't like
[1:04:22] to preach he said you you're a Liars you
[1:04:24] know but Charlie had a way of saying
[1:04:26] that but I don't know if that's
[1:04:27] necessarily true because there have been
[1:04:29] times I didn't want to preach but uh but
[1:04:33] for me I now I enjoy preaching
[1:04:34] especially here especially on Wednesday
[1:04:36] night
[1:04:37] man everybody that's there wants to be
[1:04:39] there right
[1:04:41] yeah pretty bad or they'd made up some
[1:04:43] excuse
[1:04:44] so so it's good to preach to you on a
[1:04:47] Wednesday night but sometimes the
[1:04:48] responsibilities we don't want to face
[1:04:49] up to is away from the pulpit
[1:04:52] it just being among the people
[1:04:54] and sometimes that's difficult but it's
[1:04:56] part of our job it's enduring affliction
[1:05:00] that's right
[1:05:02] making full proof of our ministry
[1:05:04] see Paul just wasn't a minister when he
[1:05:06] was among in the crowds or preaching he
[1:05:09] was one when he was with the brothers
[1:05:10] too
[1:05:11] he was he was preaching then
[1:05:14] so we have to face up to our
[1:05:16] responsibility God help us today
[1:05:18] but the Branham said even many times we
[1:05:20] find it's hard to say but it's true that
[1:05:22] ministers many times shirk a
[1:05:24] responsibility for standing for the true
[1:05:26] word of God when they're confronted with
[1:05:28] it they'll stroke that responsibility so
[1:05:30] in our preaching we've got to preach the
[1:05:32] word
[1:05:33] and Minister shirt that responsibility
[1:05:35] he said but ministers they'll come face
[1:05:37] to face with truth and then walk away
[1:05:39] from it see he said there seems like
[1:05:41] there is something they don't want to
[1:05:43] face up to it
[1:05:45] see you have a responsibility but you
[1:05:48] don't have to be a prophet to have that
[1:05:49] responsibility
[1:05:51] listen you don't have a prophet's
[1:05:53] responsibility but I I have a pastor's
[1:05:55] responsibility but Joel and brother
[1:05:57] Allen they have a Minister's
[1:05:58] responsibility
[1:06:00] listen what brother Brandon says in that
[1:06:02] message he said the lion is Roar who can
[1:06:04] but fear God has spoke who can but
[1:06:07] prophesy when you when you see God doing
[1:06:09] something
[1:06:10] I might not be a prophet Jonah said I
[1:06:12] might not be a prophet or the son of a
[1:06:14] prophet but God is spoke who can but
[1:06:17] prophesy
[1:06:18] I'll say that to every person that tells
[1:06:20] you what you got to sit down and quit
[1:06:22] preaching I may not be a prophet may not
[1:06:25] be the son of a prophet but God is
[1:06:27] spoken in our day who can but prophesy
[1:06:30] he said I might not be a prophet I might
[1:06:32] not be doing this that or the other when
[1:06:34] I see God doing anything and I see it
[1:06:36] here in the word and he promised it who
[1:06:39] can hold their peace and keep still
[1:06:41] sure he said he stunned it amen do we
[1:06:43] see God doing something today if we see
[1:06:45] God has done something we have a
[1:06:47] responsibility to that and if he's given
[1:06:50] us a gift to preach we have a
[1:06:51] responsibility to preach it
[1:06:53] it's not just the preachers have a
[1:06:55] responsibility are you still okay
[1:06:56] tonight
[1:06:57] we're going to get through this pretty
[1:06:58] quick but parents have a responsibility
[1:07:02] and I wouldn't approach this like this
[1:07:04] if brother Branham hadn't in that sermon
[1:07:06] but I think it'll be good it'll be good
[1:07:08] for me and maybe for you as well
[1:07:12] but the battle said to face up to
[1:07:14] responsibility sometimes it takes a very
[1:07:16] hide off of us to do that
[1:07:19] foreign
[1:07:21] parents have responsibilities
[1:07:23] as a father brother Branham mentions a
[1:07:26] particular responsibility of fathers
[1:07:30] he says oh Jason's not going to want to
[1:07:32] hear this on his birthday
[1:07:35] as a father
[1:07:44] them little fellas you don't want to do
[1:07:46] that and I want to say in advance thank
[1:07:48] God for the good moms and dads we have
[1:07:50] here aren't afraid to discipline their
[1:07:52] children so I'm not preaching at you
[1:07:54] okay it was part of the tape
[1:07:57] part of Jonah what were the brand
[1:07:58] preached about Joan I just got to
[1:08:00] declare the whole counsel of God
[1:08:03] as a father
[1:08:05] say well I don't do that my wife does
[1:08:08] we're gonna get there in a minute
[1:08:11] as a father
[1:08:13] a child of weapon well fellas you you
[1:08:16] don't want to do that and I'll say this
[1:08:17] if
[1:08:18] you have to do that you've got a problem
[1:08:23] but as a father or a mother you've got
[1:08:25] to face the responsibility of raising
[1:08:28] that child because the Bible said spare
[1:08:31] the rod you'll spoil your son
[1:08:34] he said and that still stands good in
[1:08:37] the sight of every psychologist there is
[1:08:39] in the world I see that creeping in
[1:08:41] around the message people people are
[1:08:43] referring to psychologists about how to
[1:08:45] raise their children we God sent us a
[1:08:47] prophet
[1:08:49] to open up the word in our day we have
[1:08:51] the scriptures
[1:08:52] we know how to take care of our children
[1:08:54] and if you do it right they won't hate
[1:08:56] you because the Bible teaches you how to
[1:08:58] do it where they won't hate you
[1:09:01] amen right but now you've got to face
[1:09:04] the responsibility of raising that child
[1:09:05] he said that still stands good in the
[1:09:07] sight of every psychologist there is in
[1:09:09] the world that Still Remains God's truth
[1:09:12] he said if there had been more of that
[1:09:13] practice we wouldn't have had so much
[1:09:15] juvenile delinquency and stuff and the
[1:09:18] rot we got in the world today
[1:09:21] but the old Golden Rule of the home has
[1:09:23] been broken long time ago
[1:09:26] let's do whatever they want to
[1:09:30] I don't have to give you
[1:09:33] on Wednesday night you know
[1:09:35] all you have to do is go to Walmart
[1:09:38] they let the kids do whatever they want
[1:09:40] to
[1:09:41] and and whatever cell phone store
[1:09:44] wherever the kid the kid runs the house
[1:09:47] that's why they run advertisements to
[1:09:49] kids now
[1:09:50] advertisement to me wouldn't have done
[1:09:52] any good I didn't have any money
[1:09:54] but now what kids have is not money it's
[1:09:56] power
[1:09:58] that power over their parents and that
[1:10:01] powers if they throw a fit Mom and Dad
[1:10:02] don't know how to handle it
[1:10:04] because they've listened to
[1:10:05] psychologists instead of the word of God
[1:10:08] there's a way to handle that
[1:10:11] right
[1:10:12] God God Made You Have Made A Child a
[1:10:14] certain way where you don't have to hurt
[1:10:15] them
[1:10:16] but but you can get their attention
[1:10:19] and but see they let kids do whatever
[1:10:21] they want to the Bible says he that
[1:10:23] spareth his Rod hateth his son
[1:10:26] but he that loveth him chasteneth him at
[1:10:28] times now I know you've noticed this
[1:10:30] already brother Brown said fathers don't
[1:10:32] want to face up to the responsibility
[1:10:33] you notice how that the scriptures
[1:10:37] and I challenge you to look the
[1:10:39] scriptures never put the primary
[1:10:40] responsibility for discipline on the
[1:10:43] mother
[1:10:45] huh
[1:10:46] I'm not preaching at anybody here just
[1:10:49] so you know my wife does spank our kids
[1:10:51] probably more than I do just not as hard
[1:10:56] and honestly we rarely spank our
[1:10:59] children I'll just say it go ahead and
[1:11:00] say that maybe we should more often but
[1:11:02] but we rarely do rarely do if you do
[1:11:05] that when they're little you don't
[1:11:06] really have to do that much when they
[1:11:07] get big
[1:11:09] if you're still beating them every day
[1:11:11] when they're 16 you've got a problem
[1:11:14] gonna beat the devil into them
[1:11:17] but if you that's what your
[1:11:19] responsibility the problem is we didn't
[1:11:21] face our responsibilities when they were
[1:11:23] young
[1:11:24] and but but if you look to the scripture
[1:11:26] let's look at Ephesians 6 and 1. he said
[1:11:29] children obey your parents in the Lord
[1:11:30] for this is right that's a child's
[1:11:33] responsibility all the children said
[1:11:35] amen
[1:11:36] I love that
[1:11:38] amen
[1:11:40] honor thy father and mother which is the
[1:11:42] first commandment with promise
[1:11:44] but it may be well with thee and thou
[1:11:45] mayest lived long on the Earth
[1:11:48] verse 4 and ye fathers
[1:11:51] skips right back right over the mothers
[1:11:54] because mothers generally know how to
[1:11:55] handle it
[1:11:56] fathers generally a lot of times don't
[1:11:58] he said you fathers provoke not your
[1:12:00] children to wrath now Paul's writing to
[1:12:02] a generation of people who have been
[1:12:04] taught Corporal discipline the Romans
[1:12:06] beat their kids
[1:12:08] and the Greeks did they believed in it
[1:12:10] that's how they got them to study they
[1:12:12] just literally took them to school and
[1:12:13] beat them all day until they learned and
[1:12:16] beat them into it and so it's preaching
[1:12:18] to that generation Paul says don't
[1:12:19] provoke your children to anger
[1:12:22] I think that's still true today
[1:12:25] right right we know we're supposed to
[1:12:26] spank them but not to provoke them to
[1:12:28] anger all the children said amen
[1:12:32] huh
[1:12:34] we're not supposed to provoke them to
[1:12:35] anger now Paul knew that men would be
[1:12:37] more likely to do that than women
[1:12:39] fathers more than mothers
[1:12:41] but again there's no mention of the
[1:12:42] mother again in Colossians 3 21 the
[1:12:44] companion scripture fathers provoke not
[1:12:46] your children to anger lest they be
[1:12:49] discouraged how many times have I seen
[1:12:51] that we've all seen it where a son gets
[1:12:54] discouraged because of the way his
[1:12:56] father disciplined him
[1:12:58] but now again in our age I've noticed
[1:13:01] that fathers don't have any rights of
[1:13:04] discipline anymore
[1:13:05] or feel like they have any
[1:13:06] responsibilities to discipline well I'm
[1:13:09] at work I'm doing what I'm I'm supposed
[1:13:11] to do and that that's her job no it's
[1:13:14] our jobs
[1:13:15] to make sure it's done
[1:13:17] and to make sure because in the end he's
[1:13:19] not going to go calling for her
[1:13:21] he's going to go calling for us remember
[1:13:23] when God went looking in the garden for
[1:13:25] his wayward children why did he holler
[1:13:27] he didn't say Eve
[1:13:29] Eve Where Art Thou
[1:13:32] he said Adam
[1:13:34] why Adam is the head of the house
[1:13:37] Adam's the one who was made in the image
[1:13:38] of God
[1:13:40] Adam was the one who stood there and had
[1:13:42] the right and the responsibility and
[1:13:44] should have known better
[1:13:46] right so he goes looking for Adam if
[1:13:49] your children if your children are not
[1:13:51] disciplined properly and I'll say this
[1:13:52] in this age that we live in there's so
[1:13:54] many influences you might do everything
[1:13:55] right and you might they might still go
[1:13:57] out but they'll remember it
[1:13:59] the Bible says when they're old they
[1:14:01] won't depart from it
[1:14:02] well I'm so glad for that promise
[1:14:04] but yet you might do everything right
[1:14:06] but but if you don't you if you don't do
[1:14:09] it right there's there's stuff I can
[1:14:12] guarantee you what the end result is
[1:14:15] going to be they're going to be just
[1:14:16] like everybody else in the world but
[1:14:18] we're called to be something different
[1:14:19] and we've got to face up to that
[1:14:21] responsibility
[1:14:23] I'm going to say Amen to that tonight
[1:14:25] we got to face up to that
[1:14:27] and fathers especially we just
[1:14:34] let's break up yeah listen to me
[1:14:37] husbands if your home breaks up and
[1:14:39] God's not going to come looking for your
[1:14:41] wife
[1:14:43] don't come looking for you
[1:14:45] I said I don't think brother would mind
[1:14:47] me saying this I we've had our
[1:14:48] disagreements but but Ivy when he would
[1:14:51] talk to a husband and wife that that
[1:14:53] were fussing with one another he and
[1:14:55] maybe maybe even a wife has seen
[1:14:57] situations where her wife just went
[1:14:59] crazy run off and into the world and the
[1:15:01] first thing you would ask because
[1:15:02] sometimes it's not his fault at all
[1:15:04] there are those cases
[1:15:06] or it's not the man's fault at all but
[1:15:08] he would always ask the man first what
[1:15:10] did you do
[1:15:13] because ultimately it's your
[1:15:13] responsibility
[1:15:16] before you go blaming your wife what did
[1:15:18] you do
[1:15:20] to make her want to leave
[1:15:23] oh God
[1:15:24] see the first person should face
[1:15:25] responsibility in the poem is the
[1:15:27] husband
[1:15:28] the first person that should face
[1:15:29] responsibility in the church is the
[1:15:30] pastor
[1:15:33] blame the church if the church is dead
[1:15:37] I have first responsibility you
[1:15:38] understand
[1:15:39] the parents have responsibility for
[1:15:41] their children now both do it's a joint
[1:15:43] responsibility to train them upright and
[1:15:45] brother Branham just to illustrate this
[1:15:46] you know sometimes we get in complex
[1:15:48] family situations where it's difficult
[1:15:51] maybe you were raised in a way that your
[1:15:52] parents beat you and so you don't want
[1:15:54] to discipline your children because
[1:15:55] you're afraid of over disciplining
[1:15:57] because you know you've got some of that
[1:15:59] in you maybe you get angry well you just
[1:16:01] need to wait until you're not angry
[1:16:03] and then do it
[1:16:05] because you should never discipline them
[1:16:06] in anger but but complex family
[1:16:08] situations happen they happened in
[1:16:10] brother random's home
[1:16:12] because Mita wasn't Billy's real mother
[1:16:15] right his real mother passed away and
[1:16:17] brother Brandon married me then brother
[1:16:19] was talking about that he said I've seen
[1:16:21] his mother give him a spanking you know
[1:16:23] he's talking about Billy Paul here when
[1:16:25] he wasn't six months old
[1:16:28] but me that has never touched him at all
[1:16:31] said she ought to have done a little bit
[1:16:33] more maybe
[1:16:35] it had been different
[1:16:38] had a lot of trouble and brother Billy
[1:16:39] would tell you that
[1:16:41] brother Branham had a lot of trouble
[1:16:42] with Billy Paul as a Young Man
[1:16:44] it's a family Dynamic but we're
[1:16:46] responsible to the word
[1:16:49] right to bring up our children in the
[1:16:50] right way and again you say well I'm a
[1:16:53] failure well in brother Brown was
[1:16:54] admitting his own failures
[1:16:56] and those in his family he's gone all
[1:16:58] the time but yet aren't you glad for the
[1:17:00] grace of God
[1:17:02] aren't you glad God still gives Grace
[1:17:04] but we don't live in the in that gray
[1:17:06] area in that Grace area we live we want
[1:17:08] to live in the perfect will of God
[1:17:10] and then when we make a mistake God will
[1:17:13] Grace will make up for that but we don't
[1:17:16] want to live like that right
[1:17:18] right you don't want to live like that
[1:17:19] we want to live right according to the
[1:17:21] word just as much as we can
[1:17:24] he said maybe it'd been different she
[1:17:25] left it all up to me he said some people
[1:17:27] say they don't believe in spanking them
[1:17:29] but you know the scripture says if you
[1:17:31] spare the rod you spoil the Sun so I
[1:17:33] believe in correcting children making
[1:17:35] them mind
[1:17:36] had more of that we wouldn't have too
[1:17:38] much juvenile delinquency
[1:17:40] parents need to face up to their
[1:17:42] responsibilities
[1:17:44] I'm gonna move on aren't you happy
[1:17:48] there's a lot more we could say about
[1:17:50] that but we'll move on
[1:17:51] people have a responsibility
[1:17:54] I've talked about profits talked about
[1:17:56] preachers talked about parents maybe you
[1:18:00] don't fit in any of those groups you say
[1:18:02] brother man I I'm happy and I'm happy to
[1:18:04] go lucky tonight and I'm so excited I
[1:18:06] got to hear the parents preach that and
[1:18:08] praise God I got to hear the preacher
[1:18:10] preach sad and and the ministers
[1:18:11] preached out and the prophet preached
[1:18:13] about but but so I'm happy y'all it's
[1:18:15] time to time to go home but see the
[1:18:17] people have a responsibility every one
[1:18:19] of us are people how many people we got
[1:18:21] here tonight I don't know what the rest
[1:18:22] of you are
[1:18:24] I'm people
[1:18:27] we have a responsibility to this message
[1:18:29] yes yes you remember when when Peter
[1:18:32] comes across and he preaches his message
[1:18:34] and he says he said Wicked hands
[1:18:36] crucified the Lord Jesus in this city
[1:18:40] they were standing in the same city
[1:18:41] where it was done in and some of the
[1:18:43] same people standing there
[1:18:45] and there were three thousand that day
[1:18:47] that were pricked in their heart what
[1:18:48] did they do they didn't go away and say
[1:18:50] well that was a good sermon but they run
[1:18:52] to Peter and the apostles they said men
[1:18:53] and Brethren what shall we do
[1:18:56] what's our responsibility what
[1:18:58] responsibility do I have to the word
[1:19:00] that I've heard oh listen to me church
[1:19:02] as we as we hurry through this last part
[1:19:04] remember we have a responsibility to
[1:19:07] this message
[1:19:09] oh God help us to realize that today
[1:19:12] brother Branham said any man that comes
[1:19:13] into the presence of God is responsible
[1:19:16] before God from that minute on to tell
[1:19:19] somebody else
[1:19:21] he said look at Abraham look at Moses
[1:19:23] look at Peter look at Paul the moment
[1:19:25] they come into the presence of God
[1:19:26] recognize themselves Sinners and sealed
[1:19:29] their testimony with their life
[1:19:31] look the little lady speaking the woman
[1:19:33] at the well he said she couldn't say it
[1:19:35] stay no longer she went to the city and
[1:19:37] told the men come see the man that told
[1:19:39] me the things I've done isn't this the
[1:19:41] Messiah they could not deny it because
[1:19:43] it was scriptural certainly he said yes
[1:19:45] they've got to do it a man when we got a
[1:19:48] responsibility of telling others as
[1:19:50] Moses did as Peter did as Paul did
[1:19:53] he said after these things
[1:19:55] I was talking to people who are watching
[1:19:57] the discernment night after night
[1:19:59] watching The Sign of the son of man
[1:20:01] he said after these things you've seen
[1:20:03] it and come into His presence
[1:20:06] I would say after a meeting like we had
[1:20:08] the other day we have a responsibility
[1:20:10] to testify of our healing yeah
[1:20:13] yeah after a church service where God
[1:20:15] moves we've got a responsibility to tell
[1:20:18] somebody
[1:20:19] to preach the word with our lives and if
[1:20:21] necessary use words
[1:20:24] all right we have a responsibility we
[1:20:27] can't deny it as scriptural
[1:20:29] and he said after you've seen and come
[1:20:31] into His presence you're responsible for
[1:20:33] the message to get to somebody else you
[1:20:36] just cannot sit still with it you must
[1:20:38] take it to someone else
[1:20:40] and he picks that up in the same sermon
[1:20:42] that we've been we've been looking at a
[1:20:44] man running from the presence of the
[1:20:46] Lord he said many times I've had people
[1:20:48] come say I know that's right brother
[1:20:49] Branham but if I did that they would
[1:20:51] kick me out of the church what of it if
[1:20:54] if you don't they're going to kick you
[1:20:55] out up there
[1:20:57] well I'd rather be kicked out down here
[1:20:59] than up there
[1:21:00] wouldn't you
[1:21:01] said so you got to be kicked out
[1:21:03] somewhere see you might as well face up
[1:21:05] to it instead of running from it and say
[1:21:07] well I'll go over here I won't go back
[1:21:10] he said go back sure listen to some more
[1:21:12] of it listen to some more of it search
[1:21:15] the scriptures Jesus said search the
[1:21:17] scriptures for in them you think you
[1:21:18] have eternal life and they are they that
[1:21:20] testify me but we find that people won't
[1:21:22] face up with that
[1:21:24] just like brother random in his flesh
[1:21:26] didn't want to face up to preaching
[1:21:27] marriage and divorce many times we in
[1:21:29] our flesh don't want to face up to
[1:21:30] hearing
[1:21:32] certain messages preached
[1:21:36] I say oh God
[1:21:38] help me to be a faithful hearer yeah and
[1:21:40] then a faithful doer of the word
[1:21:43] help me not to run from any sermon
[1:21:47] from anything you would have me preach
[1:21:49] or listen to
[1:21:51] that would that would maybe be maybe my
[1:21:53] life doesn't cope just exactly with it
[1:21:55] but Lord I want it to
[1:21:57] could you say Amen to that tonight I
[1:22:00] wanted to Lord I want to face my
[1:22:02] responsibility I don't want to run from
[1:22:04] I don't want to face it maybe there's
[1:22:05] something some little thing in your life
[1:22:07] and you think well I know brother
[1:22:09] Brandon preached against that so you
[1:22:10] just kind of avoid that now I would say
[1:22:12] go listen to it search it out find it
[1:22:14] maybe it's just the devil trying to
[1:22:16] trying to bring condemnation so you
[1:22:18] don't have any faith that might be all
[1:22:20] it is you might have misunderstood but
[1:22:22] if it's the truth you need to cope with
[1:22:24] it
[1:22:25] are you with me tonight
[1:22:27] cope with it
[1:22:29] hey man he said being brought into the
[1:22:32] presence of God
[1:22:34] and see when God made a promise and God
[1:22:36] is obligated to that promise you
[1:22:39] obligated to his word do you believe
[1:22:40] that tonight
[1:22:42] and when he brings that promise to pass
[1:22:44] then people are afraid to face up to the
[1:22:46] responsibility of coping with the
[1:22:49] message of the hour he said we find that
[1:22:51] everywhere and when you see then in this
[1:22:54] day when the word of God has made these
[1:22:56] promises of things that we see happening
[1:22:58] now he said we've got the responsibility
[1:23:00] to either face up to it or get away from
[1:23:02] it
[1:23:03] you can't stay neutral you've got to do
[1:23:07] something about it some move has got to
[1:23:10] be made
[1:23:11] don't you see there had to be some leaf
[1:23:14] they couldn't face up to the
[1:23:15] responsibility but when did they do that
[1:23:18] well hey man when the third poll was
[1:23:20] about to be Vindicated
[1:23:22] that's when they left
[1:23:24] right at the greatest moment of Victory
[1:23:26] if they could have stayed that's when
[1:23:28] they left but there was a group that
[1:23:29] stayed brother Brandon said some of them
[1:23:31] left when he talked about the dream of
[1:23:34] the pyramid I believe that Junior
[1:23:35] Jackson had the dream of the pyramid he
[1:23:37] said some of them left when they but he
[1:23:39] said he cried off the top of that
[1:23:40] pyramid of the Crowbar he said look
[1:23:42] there keep looking in there and the ones
[1:23:46] that stayed and kept looking amen that's
[1:23:48] the bride
[1:23:50] that's the elect Hallelujah aren't you
[1:23:53] glad to be a part of that group tonight
[1:23:55] it's the true bride
[1:23:57] hey man they face up to that
[1:23:58] responsibility of looking into that
[1:24:00] stone looking into that stature of a
[1:24:02] perfect man until you're changed into
[1:24:04] that
[1:24:05] Hallelujah people invent new doctrines
[1:24:08] and come up with new things so they
[1:24:10] don't want to face up to the
[1:24:10] responsibility of a rapture
[1:24:13] the responsibility
[1:24:16] body change is a responsibility
[1:24:18] because you're not just saying it about
[1:24:20] somebody else
[1:24:21] someday there'll be one you're saying
[1:24:23] Lord there's a Rapture in me
[1:24:26] I want to express that Rapture that
[1:24:29] Resurrection until one day my body has
[1:24:31] changed
[1:24:32] amen
[1:24:34] you can't stay neutral some move has got
[1:24:36] to be made
[1:24:37] he said you can't come in that church
[1:24:39] door and go out the same person you came
[1:24:40] in
[1:24:42] either further away or closer to God
[1:24:44] every time you come in or go out there
[1:24:47] I know we want to hear a lot of the good
[1:24:49] things and I love preaching the good
[1:24:51] things I want to preach those as much as
[1:24:53] I can like I've been talking about we
[1:24:54] want to preach the promises not just the
[1:24:57] problems we want to tell you about the
[1:24:59] promises but we do have to face up to
[1:25:01] the responsibility of those promises see
[1:25:04] those those ten spies that the promise
[1:25:05] was true they said yes the grapes are
[1:25:07] there we we we're aware that your word
[1:25:10] the word is true it's a land flowing
[1:25:12] with milk and honey but they couldn't
[1:25:13] face up to the responsibility of
[1:25:15] actually going in there and taking the
[1:25:17] land I wonder how many of us tonight are
[1:25:19] willing to face up to the responsibility
[1:25:21] Lord Lord I want to be the kind of a
[1:25:23] deacon that's the third pole the opening
[1:25:25] of the word requires I want to be the
[1:25:27] kind of a pastor that the third poll
[1:25:29] requires I want to be the kind of a
[1:25:31] church at the opening of the word
[1:25:32] requires us to be
[1:25:34] I don't want to let go of any
[1:25:36] responsibility that I have
[1:25:38] amen
[1:25:40] we have a responsibility to this message
[1:25:42] live clean and pure and keep it keep it
[1:25:45] right before the people
[1:25:47] responsibility
[1:25:49] now watch
[1:25:51] he said when you find these things
[1:25:52] though
[1:25:54] he said when we're confronted and coming
[1:25:56] to a meeting
[1:25:57] and see the power of God moving and
[1:25:59] doing things doing Supernatural work see
[1:26:02] it performed look in this Bible and see
[1:26:04] that it's promised for this hour
[1:26:06] then when we see those things and we are
[1:26:08] confronted with the responsibility to
[1:26:10] either accept it he said I mean as for
[1:26:12] ourselves
[1:26:14] he said now many people sympathize
[1:26:16] many people say it's right but that
[1:26:19] don't make it he said that ain't the
[1:26:20] thing you're responsible for
[1:26:22] oh God
[1:26:24] I used to be example of marriage he said
[1:26:26] if you if you agreed that a woman was
[1:26:29] the most beautiful woman in the world
[1:26:31] you could agree that she was virtuous
[1:26:33] you could agree that she was
[1:26:34] marriageable that she was she was right
[1:26:36] she was the the woman for you the right
[1:26:40] one
[1:26:40] God LED you to her
[1:26:43] but you never did anything about it
[1:26:46] you never put put a ring on it as we
[1:26:48] would say today
[1:26:49] you never gave her a wedding band
[1:26:51] all of your sympathizing with her would
[1:26:53] never do you any good
[1:26:55] you'll never be one until you actually
[1:26:57] do something about it
[1:26:59] and that's where he said faith without
[1:27:00] works is dead
[1:27:02] right because you you've got to do
[1:27:03] something he said grace and works are
[1:27:05] married he said if you told me you were
[1:27:07] married faith and works are married if
[1:27:09] you told me you were married and he said
[1:27:11] I never saw your wife after a while I
[1:27:13] began to doubt it
[1:27:14] after a while you have to produce
[1:27:15] something
[1:27:17] amen and so that's what this message is
[1:27:19] you can agree with the message but you
[1:27:21] got to live the message
[1:27:24] amen Lord help me to do it tonight
[1:27:26] so that's the same thing the message is
[1:27:28] you might say it's right this that or
[1:27:30] the other and say I sympathize with it I
[1:27:32] believe it's the truth but you've got to
[1:27:33] accept it it's got to become a part of
[1:27:35] you and you a part of it then it's yours
[1:27:38] who am I but all amen all the
[1:27:41] responsibility is yours but also all all
[1:27:44] of the good things
[1:27:45] are you with me now when I married my
[1:27:47] wife I took on responsibility for our
[1:27:49] bills
[1:27:51] I'm the husband that's my job I don't
[1:27:54] care what anybody tells you today it's
[1:27:55] my job
[1:27:56] she can help and she can work and do
[1:27:58] things if she's never worked outside the
[1:28:00] home but she she does many things I
[1:28:02] don't want to do
[1:28:03] in the house and so and so that's the
[1:28:06] way it's been but I understand in this
[1:28:08] age that we live in sometimes they have
[1:28:10] to help but it's my responsibility
[1:28:12] but when I got the responsibility when I
[1:28:14] took hey man that's where the window was
[1:28:16] talking about the veil when I took that
[1:28:18] Veil and put it on my shoulder yeah then
[1:28:20] what was that when she put it on my
[1:28:22] shoulder she was giving up the
[1:28:23] responsibility to me but we share in the
[1:28:26] blessings
[1:28:27] amen we share equally in the blessings
[1:28:30] of children we share in the blessings of
[1:28:33] Peace in the home we share because
[1:28:35] somebody stepped up and took the
[1:28:37] responsibility aren't you glad there was
[1:28:39] a groom one day that stepped up and died
[1:28:41] under no rugged tree to take the
[1:28:43] responsibility
[1:28:45] not my will but thine be done he took
[1:28:47] the responsibility faced up to it in his
[1:28:49] own third full ministry
[1:28:51] it meant his own death
[1:28:54] but he said I'm going to face up to it
[1:28:56] amen take the responsibility
[1:28:59] for you and me
[1:29:01] Paul says for the joy that was set
[1:29:02] before him
[1:29:03] he endured the cross despising the shame
[1:29:06] amen
[1:29:10] he said when you marry this certain
[1:29:12] woman
[1:29:13] that you have chosen you're one then
[1:29:15] and that's the way you are with Christ
[1:29:19] amen you got a few more minutes and
[1:29:21] we'll close
[1:29:22] he said when you see him manifested and
[1:29:24] made real then you're a part of him and
[1:29:26] he's part of you and together you're a
[1:29:29] part of the message
[1:29:30] and so we find out that we have many
[1:29:32] easy ways to go
[1:29:34] ships going down to Tarsus do they tell
[1:29:36] me that the ships to Tarsus were the
[1:29:38] easiest ships of that time to be on it
[1:29:41] was like going on a cruise ship
[1:29:43] they had all the Comforts of home so
[1:29:46] Donna didn't seek out a a hardship he
[1:29:49] didn't make a play on words he didn't an
[1:29:52] unintentional pun he didn't he didn't
[1:29:54] seek out a pirate ship
[1:29:56] but what did he seek out
[1:29:58] he sought out a comfortable ship
[1:30:02] the biggest ship of the age was the
[1:30:04] ships going to tarshish a whole lot
[1:30:07] easier than going down to Nineveh
[1:30:10] that's the way he said we find out we
[1:30:12] have many easy ways to go ships going
[1:30:14] down to tarshish for it's easy I love
[1:30:17] this he invents the word like I did last
[1:30:19] week he said the unresponsibilities
[1:30:23] the unresponsibilities are easy
[1:30:26] it just Flows in You have everything
[1:30:28] coming everybody likes you nobody
[1:30:30] disagrees with you you disagree with
[1:30:32] nobody he said now if that ain't a dish
[1:30:33] rag
[1:30:36] said I wish he washed you that's what
[1:30:38] too many Christians say they are soft
[1:30:39] soap and everything they think all they
[1:30:40] do is join a church go in somewhere put
[1:30:43] their name on a book do a little
[1:30:44] something jump up and down shout
[1:30:45] something like that call it Christianity
[1:30:47] Christianity is an everyday rugged life
[1:30:49] living for God in this present world
[1:30:51] it's a constant burning oh how many of
[1:30:53] that constant burning today a constant
[1:30:55] burning of the fire and love of God in
[1:30:57] the heart that sets you a fire and puts
[1:30:59] you out yonder with the people making
[1:31:00] converts to Christ
[1:31:02] but it's easy to go the way the world
[1:31:04] goes it's easy to flow down the stream
[1:31:06] go out there and sit down in the river
[1:31:08] with your boat
[1:31:09] your horse and start pulling up against
[1:31:11] the current you don't make much time and
[1:31:13] it goes hard
[1:31:14] kind of like sitting and listening on a
[1:31:16] Wednesday night service
[1:31:18] rolling Upstream
[1:31:20] I gotta drive home
[1:31:22] is it raining still
[1:31:25] did I turn off the crock pot
[1:31:27] are we going to McDonald's afterwards
[1:31:30] just keep rowing it's hard it's Upstream
[1:31:33] but you're going somewhere
[1:31:35] you're going somewhere
[1:31:37] he said but you just wants that Loosely
[1:31:39] horse
[1:31:40] watch how fast you go
[1:31:42] he said he said watch how fast you pass
[1:31:45] the trees going down
[1:31:46] but look where you're going
[1:31:49] when things are floating easy remember
[1:31:52] you're going towards the great cataract
[1:31:54] down there of some sort you're going
[1:31:56] towards the falls it won't be long
[1:31:58] you'll be going over that falls
[1:32:00] just floating with the world easy the
[1:32:02] way it goes you don't want that no sir
[1:32:04] you must accept your responsibility
[1:32:07] and the responsibility that God has
[1:32:09] given us in this day to bring this
[1:32:10] message I love the fact he uses us
[1:32:13] not just me us
[1:32:16] but he says as I get older and I know my
[1:32:18] days are shortening up I feel the
[1:32:20] responsibility greater than I ever felt
[1:32:21] pressing on again he uses the plural we
[1:32:24] must do it
[1:32:25] yeah we again we we must get down to it
[1:32:28] in everywhere we go and tell the message
[1:32:31] and tell the people that Jesus Christ is
[1:32:34] coming that he's God and he's coming
[1:32:36] soon
[1:32:37] amen I told you I believe brother
[1:32:40] Branham knew that he didn't have much
[1:32:41] longer
[1:32:42] brother a Perry green tells the story of
[1:32:44] how there was uh several hundred people
[1:32:47] maybe actually a few thousand uh in uh
[1:32:50] somewhere in South America I can't
[1:32:51] remember the name of the country but
[1:32:53] they had invited brother Branham to come
[1:32:55] and and they were ready to receive water
[1:32:56] baptism kind of like the folks in Egypt
[1:32:58] were when we got there just ready to
[1:33:00] receive it and brother Branham but the
[1:33:02] Perry brought it to brother Branham and
[1:33:03] said when can you go he said brother
[1:33:05] Perry I'm not going to go baptize the
[1:33:07] people he said you go baptize those
[1:33:08] people
[1:33:09] but the person said he'd never been out
[1:33:10] of the U.S had to go get his passport
[1:33:12] and things like that and go down there
[1:33:14] he said he didn't know what to preach
[1:33:15] several thousand people sitting there he
[1:33:17] said he just got up and he read he said
[1:33:19] to just tell the things you saw and
[1:33:20] heard
[1:33:21] and so he just told his testimony and
[1:33:23] literally thousands came to Christ
[1:33:25] and come to the message of the hour oh
[1:33:27] you don't understand the power of
[1:33:29] telling how the fire got lit
[1:33:31] Oh my he said that's our responsibility
[1:33:33] I think brother Brandon did that because
[1:33:35] he knew he was leaving the scene
[1:33:37] and there had to be other ministers go
[1:33:39] out and carry on the message
[1:33:41] huh right I'll watch it not just Perry
[1:33:44] green either but he's dead now too but
[1:33:46] other ministers
[1:33:47] other men and every man is going every
[1:33:50] man makes his own mistakes and has his
[1:33:52] own Ministry and has to answer to God
[1:33:53] for whether he faced up to the
[1:33:55] responsibilities of it but somebody else
[1:33:56] step up to the plate
[1:33:58] pray that if the Lord cares God would
[1:34:00] call more men to take up the
[1:34:02] responsibility of a third pole Ministry
[1:34:04] it's hard
[1:34:05] but somebody's got to do it
[1:34:10] he said pressing on we must do it
[1:34:12] he said we must get down to it
[1:34:14] everywhere we go and tell the message
[1:34:15] and tell the people that Jesus Christ is
[1:34:17] coming that he's God and he's coming
[1:34:20] soon he said there's not a hope left in
[1:34:22] the world but the coming of the Lord and
[1:34:24] brother dwells on that for a while in
[1:34:26] that sermon he said we've got to tell
[1:34:27] the people we've got a responsibility
[1:34:29] tell the people the Lord is coming
[1:34:32] that is our responsibility
[1:34:35] musicians go ahead and come I'd read a
[1:34:37] story about a a new boss to come into a
[1:34:41] a place was actually an airline you know
[1:34:44] how bad airlines are with customer
[1:34:45] service you got put on hold the other
[1:34:47] day with one and they're just awful
[1:34:50] awful with customer service they'll put
[1:34:52] you on hold for days
[1:34:53] and so he was going to fix it and so he
[1:34:56] walks into this Airline and he's a new
[1:34:58] boss somebody recognizing him he walks
[1:35:00] in there's a man sitting in one of the
[1:35:01] cubicles and the phone's ringing just
[1:35:03] keeps ringing you know back when phones
[1:35:05] rang
[1:35:06] they just stop ringing
[1:35:08] and the phone just rang and rang and
[1:35:10] rang and this man's sitting there with
[1:35:12] his feet up
[1:35:13] and he didn't recognize the new boss the
[1:35:15] new boss walks by and said why don't you
[1:35:16] answer that phone
[1:35:18] he said I don't work here I work in the
[1:35:20] maintenance department he said you mean
[1:35:22] you did work in the maintenance
[1:35:23] department
[1:35:26] hahaha
[1:35:27] all right oh God if we're going to turn
[1:35:30] this thing around everybody's gonna have
[1:35:31] to answer the phone
[1:35:33] if the phone's ringing answer it you see
[1:35:35] I don't feel like much of a Preacher if
[1:35:37] the phone's ringing answer it I don't
[1:35:38] feel like much of a a Sunday school
[1:35:40] teacher I don't feel like much of a much
[1:35:42] of a deacon or a trustee or a singer but
[1:35:44] if the phone's ringing
[1:35:46] answer the phone
[1:35:48] hey man it might be the last one on the
[1:35:50] other end of the line looking for a life
[1:35:52] somewhere that'll reflect to them about
[1:35:54] the coming of of Christ
[1:35:56] don't you want to take that
[1:35:58] responsibility today because when you
[1:36:00] take on that responsibility you also get
[1:36:02] the reward
[1:36:03] of going home
[1:36:05] that's what we want
[1:36:07] let's bow our heads together
[1:36:10] I know some of you are tired and you've
[1:36:13] struggled
[1:36:15] brother Ben I am I've heard about
[1:36:16] responsibilities till I'm tired of it
[1:36:18] tonight but
[1:36:19] may be the case
[1:36:22] but if we could just face up to it for a
[1:36:24] moment
[1:36:25] if we Face our responsibilities now it'd
[1:36:27] be easier down the road
[1:36:28] I found that I'm a great procrastinator
[1:36:30] among in some things and if it's
[1:36:33] something that doesn't have to be done I
[1:36:34] can just put it off and put it off
[1:36:36] when it comes to the message of the hour
[1:36:38] I don't want to be that way
[1:36:40] I want to face up to it
[1:36:43] Lord help me to preach it with all of my
[1:36:45] might
[1:36:46] help me to be the kind of Pastor that
[1:36:48] the third pole Ministry if we could say
[1:36:51] it that way demands at this opening of
[1:36:54] the word demands another another
[1:36:55] generation might have got by without
[1:36:57] studying but not mine
[1:36:59] another generation might have got by
[1:37:01] without with preaching some things that
[1:37:03] may have been true maybe not not ours
[1:37:06] we've got a responsibility we've got to
[1:37:08] face up to it Lord help me to do that
[1:37:11] help me to do then if I make a mistake
[1:37:13] in my sincerity of trying to do what's
[1:37:14] right I know you'll cover for me Lord
[1:37:17] hey man could you make that your prayer
[1:37:19] tonight Heavenly Father
[1:37:20] I'm so thankful Lord
[1:37:22] have these people here tonight at
[1:37:24] members

[1:37:32] Lord those big fish could be caught by
[1:37:34] the word in our hour
[1:37:36] so thankful for that
[1:37:37] Lord maybe there's something that
[1:37:40] that they struggle with and facing up to
[1:37:42] a responsibility whether it's a
[1:37:45] with Lord and recognizing the
[1:37:47] responsibility they have to the message
[1:37:49] or whether it's a parent or a preacher
[1:37:51] or some other office in the church
[1:37:54] Lord I pray you'd help us to step up to
[1:37:56] the plate

[1:38:13] help
[1:38:14] oh God we don't want to have to go
