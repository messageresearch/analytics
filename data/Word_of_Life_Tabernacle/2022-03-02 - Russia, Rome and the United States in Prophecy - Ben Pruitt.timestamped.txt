[0:00] thou o king sawest
[0:02] and behold a great image
[0:04] this great image whose brightness was
[0:06] excellent stood before thee and the form
[0:08] thereof was terrible
[0:10] this image's head was a fine gold
[0:13] his breast and his arms of silver his
[0:15] belly and his thighs of brass
[0:17] his legs of iron his feet part of iron
[0:19] and part of clay
[0:21] thou saw us till that a stone was cut
[0:23] out without hands which smote the image
[0:25] upon his feet that were of iron and clay
[0:28] and break them to pieces
[0:30] then was the iron the clay the brass the
[0:32] silver and the gold
[0:34] broke into pieces together
[0:36] became like the shaft of the summer
[0:38] threshing floors and the wind carried
[0:40] them away
[0:41] listen that's the future of the gentile
[0:43] world kingdoms
[0:46] that's right
[0:47] become like the shaft of the summer
[0:49] threshing floors and the wind carried
[0:50] them away that no place was found for
[0:52] them and the stone that smote the image
[0:54] became a great mountain and filled the
[0:56] whole earth
[0:58] he said this is the dream and we will
[0:59] tell the interpretation thereof before
[1:01] the king thou o king are the king of
[1:03] kings for the god of heaven hath given
[1:05] thee a kingdom
[1:06] power and strength and glory and
[1:08] wheresoever the children of men dwell
[1:10] the beasts of the field and the fowls of
[1:12] the heaven hath be given into thine hand
[1:14] and hath made thee ruler over them all
[1:17] thou art this head of gold after thee
[1:19] shall arise another kingdom inferior to
[1:21] thee and another third kingdom of brass
[1:23] which shall bear rule over all the earth
[1:26] and the fourth kingdom shall be strong
[1:27] as iron for as much as iron breaketh in
[1:30] pieces and subdueth all things and as
[1:32] iron that breaketh all these shall it
[1:34] break in pieces and bruise
[1:36] and whereas thou saw us to feed and toes
[1:39] part of potter's clay and part of iron
[1:42] the kingdom shall be divided but there
[1:43] shall be in it of the strength of the
[1:44] iron for as much as thou sawest the iron
[1:47] mixed with miry clay and as the toes of
[1:50] the feet were part of iron and part of
[1:51] clay so the kingdom shall be partly
[1:53] strong and partly broken and whereas
[1:56] thou sawest iron mixed with miry clay
[1:58] they shall mingle themselves with the
[1:59] seed of men
[2:00] they shall not cleave one to another
[2:02] even as iron is not mixed with clay
[2:04] and in the days of these kings shall the
[2:06] god of heaven set up the kingdom aren't
[2:07] you glad he's going to do that
[2:09] which shall never be destroyed and the
[2:11] kingdom shall not be left to other
[2:12] people but it shall break in pieces and
[2:14] consume all these kingdoms and it shall
[2:17] stand forever
[2:18] for as much as i saw us that the stone
[2:20] was cut out of the mountain without
[2:22] hands and let it break in pieces the
[2:24] iron the brass the clay the silver and
[2:26] the gold the great god hath made known
[2:28] to the king what shall come to pass
[2:30] hereafter and the dream
[2:33] is certain
[2:34] and the interpretation thereof
[2:37] sure
[2:38] amen let's bow our heads together for a
[2:39] word of prayer heavenly father we thank
[2:42] you for a sure word of prophecy
[2:45] lord and even in the new testament you
[2:46] spoke of a more sure word of prophecy
[2:48] something we could hang our hat on so to
[2:51] speak something we can we can guarantee
[2:53] lord that there will come a time when
[2:56] every kingdom of this earth will be
[2:58] destroyed and and and the great stone
[3:01] that was cut out of the mountain without
[3:02] hands will fill the whole earth and your
[3:04] kingdom will last forever we thank you
[3:06] for that lord and we thank you for the
[3:09] promises that you've given us lord and
[3:11] we look at the age that we live in many
[3:13] times it might strike fear upon the
[3:15] heart of people but lord as christians
[3:17] tonight we rejoice knowing lord that
[3:19] this kingdom is coming lord this this
[3:22] this stone lord is coming and the end
[3:25] times are here because we believe in a
[3:28] better kingdom one to come lord i pray
[3:30] that you to help each person or maybe
[3:31] there's one sick here tonight or have
[3:33] some need on their heart in their life i
[3:36] pray that you'd reach out to them even
[3:37] while we're talking about these things
[3:39] lord may the revelation begin to strike
[3:41] and stimulation of revelation take over
[3:44] the lord and their bodies and in their
[3:46] minds and take away the tiredness and
[3:48] the and everything that's going on lord
[3:50] may you begin to speak we pray in jesus
[3:53] name
[3:53] amen amen god bless you you can be
[3:56] seated
[3:58] excuse me for having you stand so long
[4:02] the current situation in ukraine makes
[4:05] us all kind of sit up and think
[4:07] and begin to look at what's going on in
[4:09] the world around us
[4:11] and we begin to realize that bible days
[4:14] are here the end times are here
[4:17] and yet there's been many times that
[4:19] we've looked at things and said this
[4:21] must be it and
[4:22] and realize that there was still some
[4:24] time left because we're still here
[4:26] but there will come a time when it is it
[4:29] right when it's it when the war starts
[4:33] and when
[4:34] uh when everything begins to be set in
[4:36] motion for the tribulation that time is
[4:38] coming and it could be now
[4:42] right there's nothing saying this
[4:43] couldn't be it it may not be
[4:45] but it could be
[4:47] right and so it behooves us to be ready
[4:50] and to be watching and to know these
[4:52] things because he comes as a thief in
[4:54] the night but not to us
[4:56] we have been told and shown these things
[4:59] so that we can be ready and have our
[5:01] garments on
[5:02] and be waiting
[5:03] a word bride for the bridegroom that's
[5:05] coming amen
[5:07] now
[5:08] we look at at the current ukraine
[5:10] situation and i believe i put on the
[5:13] slides uh some situation this was on a
[5:15] cnn report actually those people are
[5:18] desperate because they see the the wolf
[5:20] is at the door and even tonight they're
[5:23] being bombed and they're being destroyed
[5:25] in their cities
[5:27] and and they're just being taken over by
[5:29] a
[5:30] foreign you can't we can't even imagine
[5:31] what that feels like but they're praying
[5:34] and and but they realize at the end time
[5:36] there's message people there there
[5:38] are churches there there's there's a
[5:40] good group of message people in ukraine
[5:43] and so we need to our prayers need to be
[5:45] with them
[5:46] for safety because we believe that god's
[5:48] able to keep them even
[5:50] during this time and yet there's no
[5:52] promise that war couldn't break out or
[5:54] that something could happen and we might
[5:56] be caught up in about in a difficult
[5:57] political situation we don't know people
[6:00] have been before
[6:01] right and and so we don't know that
[6:03] we're not always promised that
[6:04] everything's going to be just the way
[6:06] that we want it to be but
[6:08] they were praying and so we need to be
[6:10] praying for them as they've been praying
[6:12] and you can see on that next slide that
[6:14] there's uh
[6:15] that was a bomb that a missile that
[6:17] actually hit the tv station there in
[6:19] kyiv and when it did
[6:21] it actually destroyed as well the jewish
[6:24] memorial one of the greatest uh worst
[6:27] moments of the holocaust was there in
[6:29] ukraine and keith there's a memorial to
[6:31] it a great concrete menorah that they
[6:33] had put there and the russians bombed it
[6:35] the other day and then turn around
[6:37] called them nazis
[6:39] i tell you what there's a lot of stuff
[6:40] going on
[6:42] but now
[6:44] but the situation is dire for them but
[6:47] let's take a step back and look at what
[6:49] the word tells us about russia about
[6:51] america about the world that we live in
[6:54] when brother branham was born
[6:56] the russians were a backwards former
[6:58] empire
[6:59] they were taken over by communism in
[7:02] around 1918 and finally become the
[7:05] soviet union under joseph stalin
[7:07] and then in 1960
[7:10] we find that they had progressed to the
[7:12] point of having being a superpower
[7:14] having a control over much of the earth
[7:17] and there was a man by the name of
[7:19] nikita khrushchev and he was the leader
[7:22] of the soviets some of you probably
[7:24] remember this i'm not old enough to
[7:26] remember it but some of you do
[7:27] and he was the leader of the soviets
[7:29] there's a famous uh time when he took
[7:31] off his shoe and he banged it pounded it
[7:34] on the table and brother branham saw
[7:36] that and he attached a significance to
[7:38] it because it was reported widely in the
[7:40] news at that time he attached a
[7:42] significance to that event and tied it
[7:45] to daniel's vision in daniel chapter 2.
[7:48] now
[7:50] dwight eisenhower was the president of
[7:52] the u.s at that time
[7:53] and the name eisenhower means iron you
[7:56] can go look it up google it and however
[7:58] you want to look it up
[7:59] eisenhower means iron
[8:02] khrushchev means
[8:04] clay
[8:05] and so he said that was the iron and the
[8:08] clay in fact he said these two leaders
[8:10] he said were the big toes
[8:12] on the feet leading four other kingdoms
[8:15] each
[8:16] and and so that was going on at that
[8:18] time
[8:20] and
[8:21] so now brother branham said daniel had a
[8:23] vision
[8:25] he said the head of gold was babylon
[8:27] he said watch how that come down he said
[8:29] watch he said take the history in the
[8:31] bible he said and the next was the
[8:33] breast here of silver meets the persians
[8:35] he said the next was brass each time it
[8:37] got harder and harder and it showed that
[8:40] the gentile image could not stand
[8:42] because gold is the heaviest of all of
[8:44] them and it was top heavy it couldn't
[8:47] stand and each time he said the gold was
[8:49] the softest and silver is next and then
[8:52] brass next and then iron was next and he
[8:54] said each one of those kingdoms has
[8:56] succeeded one another just exactly the
[8:58] way the bible said they would do i want
[9:00] you to notice the accuracy of the vision
[9:02] what did daniel tell the king he said
[9:05] the vision is certain the dream is
[9:08] certain he said and the interpretation
[9:10] is is sure
[9:12] and so this isn't just brother branham
[9:13] but bible scholars over all over the
[9:15] world and down to the ages have seen
[9:17] these gentile kingdoms as they've come
[9:19] up he said just exactly the way the
[9:21] bible said they would do he said notice
[9:23] he said then at the end time he said
[9:25] before the stone was viewed out of the
[9:26] mountain the image had ten toes he said
[9:29] now that would be five on each foot two
[9:31] big toes four and five standing together
[9:33] he said as much as now to see that they
[9:35] were mixed with iron and clay he said
[9:38] now remember that was the gentile
[9:39] kingdom anyone knows that that they were
[9:42] iron and clay they would not mix and so
[9:44] much as iron and clay won't mix
[9:46] neither will these mix or cleave
[9:48] together they can't get along
[9:52] now that's why we have war
[9:55] in ukraine
[9:58] now what's happening in ukraine is that
[10:00] the west and the east are battling
[10:03] right but ukraine wanted to be aligned
[10:05] with the with the iron
[10:08] and the clay doesn't like it
[10:11] now think about it this nation is still
[10:12] represented in the iron this nation
[10:15] even under a protestant majority is
[10:18] still represented under romanism
[10:22] you can go and find that that don't ever
[10:24] stop the gentile kingdoms go all the way
[10:26] to the feet and in the toes that's the
[10:28] very very last form the most recent form
[10:32] that they're in before the coming of the
[10:34] great stone is actually they are iron
[10:36] and clay mixed together and even
[10:39] intermarried together
[10:40] random type that to protestantism and
[10:42] catholicism and he said that eisenhower
[10:45] was representing the iron khrushchev was
[10:48] representing the clay and so there's
[10:50] there's no
[10:51] wonder that there'll be war because the
[10:53] iron and the clay will not mix
[10:56] that's what makes it weak
[10:59] right and eventually there will be a war
[11:02] where russia will bomb the united states
[11:04] and bomb rome
[11:05] brother branham taught us that
[11:07] well there will be a nuclear war why
[11:10] because the iron and the clay won't mix
[11:14] they can't get along and god intended
[11:16] that it would be that way he allowed
[11:17] that now
[11:18] he said did you notice he said did you
[11:20] know what the name khrushchev means in
[11:21] russia dirt or clay he was heading up of
[11:23] them kingdoms you know what eisenhower
[11:25] means the head of this iron
[11:28] iron and clay and they couldn't mix
[11:29] together he took his shoe and beat it he
[11:31] said there's no mixing together they
[11:33] can't mix they won't cleave one to the
[11:36] other
[11:37] so when we saw
[11:38] russia become westernized over the last
[11:40] couple of decades you begin to wonder
[11:42] how is that possible for them to get
[11:44] that way but prophecy won't fail
[11:47] right they may be they may look like
[11:49] they're coming towards us but they won't
[11:51] cleave together
[11:52] that's prophecy they never will until
[11:54] the end time and so there's always going
[11:56] to be a war there there's always going
[11:59] to be a a difference there a difference
[12:01] of opinion now he said do you see
[12:03] friends the next thing left is the stone
[12:05] to be cut out
[12:07] the coming of the lord now i don't
[12:08] identify with the iron i want you to
[12:10] understand this tonight i am an american
[12:13] but i don't identify with the roman part
[12:16] and i don't identify with the clay
[12:18] the communist part
[12:20] right i don't identify with that what do
[12:23] i identify with the stone
[12:27] right
[12:28] and that's what we got to keep our minds
[12:30] on
[12:31] because many times we get wrapped up in
[12:32] politics and what we're actually doing
[12:34] you realize both democrats and
[12:36] republicans are the iron
[12:39] they represent that our political system
[12:42] represents the iron romanism
[12:46] right
[12:47] and so when we get wrapped up in
[12:48] politics that's exactly what we're
[12:50] representing eisenhower was a great
[12:52] president brother brown said he prayed
[12:53] for him he said he was a wonderful
[12:55] president he said in one place he loved
[12:57] him
[12:58] but he still represented the iron
[13:01] right and so we've got to make sure that
[13:02] we understand
[13:04] where we're at now so and so it's not
[13:07] wrong to to want to advocate for those
[13:09] things that are right i i even maybe i
[13:11] shouldn't tell you this but i vote you
[13:13] know
[13:14] i know that's a but i've always said
[13:16] that well i can't complain unless i vote
[13:18] so
[13:18] so i'd have a problem with doing that
[13:20] and i know some people don't and that's
[13:21] perfectly fine that's your american
[13:23] privilege by not voting you vote right
[13:26] you vote not to vote
[13:28] so and that's fine sometimes it's hard
[13:30] to know who to vote for but realize
[13:32] whoever you vote for it's the iron
[13:36] right that's you're voting for that
[13:38] gentile kingdom
[13:41] now
[13:42] and so brother branham said the next
[13:43] thing left
[13:44] is the stone to be cut out
[13:47] the coming of the lord to roll into this
[13:49] image and mash it into pieces and all
[13:52] these kingdoms will be ground and blowed
[13:54] away like the shaft on a summer's
[13:56] threshing floor we're at the end time
[13:58] brother sister can't you see where we
[14:01] are he said listen thus saith the lord
[14:05] i think when we hear thus sayeth the
[14:07] lord we ought to listen
[14:09] he said thus saith the lord repent
[14:14] we could just stop there but he said
[14:15] thus saith the lord repent
[14:18] why he said i predict three
[14:20] curtains
[14:21] in the name of the lord there's one
[14:23] called the iron curtain which will be
[14:24] russia
[14:25] so that's why he would say watch russia
[14:27] but he didn't stop there
[14:29] he said why he said watch red china
[14:33] right so he doesn't just say watch for
[14:34] us she says watch red china
[14:36] that'll be the bamboo curtain
[14:38] they're horrible
[14:40] but watch that purple curtain that's
[14:43] rising in the united states and over the
[14:44] world the roman empire the cruelest of
[14:47] all of them you know and i've kind of in
[14:49] my head over the years kind of thought
[14:51] well there'll come a day when the pope
[14:52] will be the ruler of the u.s but you
[14:54] know the bible doesn't actually say that
[14:57] it says he set up an image to the beast
[14:59] brother brown said that was the council
[15:01] of churches protestantism
[15:04] so this nation will always be a
[15:05] protestant nation
[15:08] go go go look at the book of revelation
[15:12] right it's an image it's daughters
[15:14] it's a great and she's got
[15:15] daughters
[15:16] the daughters continue to exist
[15:19] right they go on existing but they work
[15:22] together to try to defeat the uh the
[15:24] clay and and fight against communism or
[15:27] whatever it is that they're fighting
[15:28] against but it's actually working just
[15:31] in the plans of god until finally until
[15:34] finally the king of kings comes aren't
[15:36] you glad the king of kings is coming
[15:39] amen and he said they're they're
[15:40] horrible but watch that purple curtain
[15:42] that's rising now
[15:44] and he said that's the cruelest of all
[15:46] of them
[15:48] the cruelest of all of them so you look
[15:50] at what russia is doing right now
[15:53] you think about it look what russia's
[15:54] doing but a prophet of god said that
[15:56] there will come a time
[15:58] that this nation
[16:00] will do worse things than that
[16:04] now that's true that's the cruelest of
[16:06] all them look at let's look at brother
[16:07] branham's seven visions and i like to
[16:10] take this from where he's reading it he
[16:12] reads it off of the piece of paper where
[16:14] he wrote it down in 1932
[16:17] and he reads his seven visions he said
[16:18] 1932 listen to this
[16:21] as i was on my way or as i was getting
[16:22] ready to go on my way to church this
[16:24] morning it came to pass that i fell into
[16:26] a vision
[16:27] he told where his services were being
[16:29] held
[16:30] he said it came to pass that while i was
[16:31] in this vision i seen some dreadful
[16:33] things take place
[16:34] i speak this in the name of the lord
[16:37] the president which now is president
[16:38] franklin d roosevelt will cause the
[16:40] whole world to go to war now everybody
[16:42] else was all in roosevelt's camp
[16:45] and today the history books will tell
[16:46] you roosevelt was a great president but
[16:48] branham said he actually helped cause
[16:50] that war
[16:52] he said in the new dictator of italy
[16:53] mussolini shall make his first invasion
[16:55] towards ethiopia and he will take
[16:58] ethiopia but that will be his last he
[17:00] shall come to his end he said we will be
[17:02] in war with germany watch
[17:05] russia
[17:06] now watch and remember at that time
[17:08] russia was nothing
[17:10] when brother branham wrote that russia
[17:11] was just a bunch of peasants
[17:13] they were still living in the stone age
[17:16] but he says watch russia
[17:18] and we read you the quote the other day
[17:20] where brother branham said god they had
[17:21] to awaken why did russia all of a sudden
[17:24] have all these scientists and
[17:26] and be able to get nuclear weapons and
[17:28] the things that they did they went from
[17:29] the stone age to the modern age in about
[17:31] 50 years
[17:33] how were they able to do that he said
[17:35] god had to allow them to wake up
[17:38] right to bring about the end now
[17:41] he says we will be in war with germany
[17:43] watch russia now he said now i see
[17:45] communism
[17:46] nazism and fascism
[17:49] watch russia
[17:51] but that is not the main one to watch
[17:56] right so we could we could look at the
[17:58] news that's going on watch russia
[18:01] but that's not the main one to watch
[18:04] the main one to watch is the one that
[18:06] comes in peaceably by flatteries
[18:09] here among us
[18:11] in the u.s
[18:13] now do we we believe a prophet right
[18:15] we believe the prophet's words this is
[18:17] what he told us watch russia but that
[18:19] won't be the main one to watch
[18:22] he said and the reason why is because
[18:24] it's apparent what russia is doing i
[18:26] mean it's just it's fabulous really if
[18:28] you look at it it's not not what they're
[18:29] doing but the fact that it fulfills
[18:31] scripture if you look at it like i said
[18:33] this could be it
[18:34] it would make sense for this to be the
[18:36] beginning of a third world war
[18:39] it's all laying out there
[18:41] we're living in that time now is it that
[18:44] time i don't know
[18:46] but if it is i'd pray that god's will
[18:47] would be done
[18:49] but now
[18:50] he said that is not the main one to
[18:52] watch he said it has been
[18:54] an evil thing done in this country
[18:57] they have permitted women to vote
[18:59] boy that'll get you kicked off the
[19:00] internet
[19:02] he said an evil thing
[19:04] bring women to vote now why was it an
[19:06] evil thing think about it without the
[19:08] women's vote we wouldn't have abortion
[19:11] without the women's vote we wouldn't
[19:12] have had john f kennedy a catholic
[19:14] president
[19:15] without the women's vote we wouldn't
[19:16] have had a gay marriage that's just a
[19:19] fact if you go look at the way that
[19:20] women vote
[19:22] we would not have had those things i
[19:23] don't mean you you godly sisters but i
[19:26] just mean the women of this world but
[19:27] the brown said it was an evil thing
[19:30] millions of babies have died
[19:33] right they permitted women to vote he
[19:34] said this is a women's nation she will
[19:36] pollute this nation as eve did eden he
[19:38] said now you see why i'm hammering the
[19:39] way i do he said i got thus saith the
[19:41] lord
[19:43] in her voting she will elect the wrong
[19:44] person
[19:45] he said the americans will take a great
[19:47] beating at a place that germany will
[19:48] build which would be a great wall and
[19:49] brother branham kind of jumps ahead of
[19:51] himself and goes back here he said be a
[19:53] great wall built of concrete the maginot
[19:55] line 11 years before it was ever built
[19:57] but finally there will be victors
[19:59] he said then when these women help elect
[20:01] the wrong person and i seen a great
[20:03] woman rise up in the united states
[20:05] well-dressed and beautiful but cruel in
[20:07] heart she will either guide or lead this
[20:09] nation to ruination he said i got in
[20:11] parenthesis perhaps catholic church but
[20:13] you realize these things could have
[20:14] multiple
[20:16] multiple fulfillments and you'd see the
[20:18] age that we're living in look what
[20:20] happened with kamala harris here a while
[20:21] ago again i don't say that was the
[20:23] fulfillment of prophecy but what if it
[20:24] was
[20:26] and then look at what's happening with
[20:27] russia today
[20:29] where are we at
[20:31] but see that that to the bride that
[20:33] doesn't make us more bride
[20:36] oh i'm going to be the bride now i'm
[20:38] going to live for god now because these
[20:39] things are happening no you live for god
[20:41] because you love god
[20:43] because you love the word you're you're
[20:44] going to be married to somebody you you
[20:46] love not somebody you're afraid of
[20:50] right so we're not identified with that
[20:53] with that gentile kingdom now he says
[20:56] he said also he said perhaps the
[20:58] catholic church also science will
[21:00] progress
[21:01] especially in the mechanical world
[21:02] automobiles will continue to get like
[21:04] egg shaped he said finally they will
[21:06] build one that won't need a steering
[21:08] wheel
[21:08] they've got it now it will be controlled
[21:10] by some other power
[21:12] you realize how fantastic that would
[21:14] have been in 1932
[21:17] right you'll be controlled by some other
[21:18] power he said then i've seen the united
[21:20] states as one smoldering
[21:22] burnt over
[21:24] place
[21:26] it will be near the end
[21:28] now again america
[21:30] is shown as a continuation remember the
[21:32] iron and the clay is what the scripture
[21:34] said they won't get along they won't
[21:35] cleave to one another
[21:37] they won't get along so we see a battle
[21:39] between east and west
[21:41] we see a battle between capitalism and
[21:44] communism a battle between america and
[21:46] russia you could say but it's the whole
[21:48] system not just america not just russia
[21:52] and and even this nation and its
[21:54] founding it was founded as a
[21:57] as a lamb it was founded under religious
[21:59] liberty and yet if you go back and look
[22:02] at it you'll find that it was founded
[22:04] they emulated the roman system
[22:06] of the republic of rome in founding our
[22:09] system it's always had a roman element
[22:12] to it
[22:13] and the catholic church has grown in its
[22:15] power over time but again like i said it
[22:16] doesn't have to be catholic
[22:19] it doesn't have to become catholic for
[22:21] for these scriptures to be fulfilled
[22:24] in fact the bible if i understand it
[22:26] correctly says that it wouldn't because
[22:28] it would be an image to the beast and
[22:30] but they would go along with it they
[22:31] would all
[22:33] come and form a unity in order to go
[22:35] against something and so we see that as
[22:37] well where the nations are coming in
[22:39] unity to come against the russians
[22:42] right but but what is it just fulfilling
[22:44] scripture again if this is the time it's
[22:46] just the fulfillment of scripture
[22:48] and if it's not the time it's sure
[22:50] pointing to the time
[22:53] now
[22:54] here is america what what is america in
[22:56] the scriptures it's in revelation 13.
[23:00] and if you go to revelation 13 verses 1
[23:02] through 10 is the first beast which was
[23:04] pagan and and papal rome
[23:07] and then in verse 11 he said i beheld
[23:09] another beast coming up out of the earth
[23:11] and he had two horns like a lamb
[23:14] and he spake as a dragon
[23:16] and he exercises all the power of the
[23:20] first beast before him now remember
[23:22] russia was not shown as a beast
[23:26] right rome was
[23:29] and america was
[23:31] and i'm not preaching an anti-american
[23:33] doctrine tonight but i'm just showing
[23:34] you what the scripture says
[23:36] right that really what you got to watch
[23:38] out for is this nation
[23:41] if you look in the end time events this
[23:43] is the nation that that turns against
[23:46] the bride
[23:48] this is the nation
[23:49] amen this is where it all comes to now
[23:52] he said is the uh i beheld another beast
[23:54] coming up out of the earth he had two
[23:56] horns like a lamb he spake is a dragon
[23:57] he exercises all the power of the first
[24:00] beast before him and causes the earth
[24:02] and them which dwell therein to worship
[24:05] rome romanism denominationalism right
[24:08] whose deadly wound was healed that's
[24:10] pagan rome becoming papal rome and he
[24:13] said there is coming and so brother
[24:15] branham talks about that he said there's
[24:16] coming a time upon in this nation to
[24:19] where this nation is going to exercise
[24:21] all the power that the beast had before
[24:23] it which was pagan rome when it became
[24:25] papal realm this nation will do that
[24:27] revelation 13 plainly explains that the
[24:30] lamb come up out of the earth the other
[24:31] beasts come out of the water sickness
[24:33] and multitudes of people out of europe
[24:35] he said this lamb come up where there
[24:36] were no people a lamb represents a
[24:39] religion the lamb of god remember he
[24:40] said it spoke like a lamb it was a lamb
[24:43] he said then after a while it received
[24:45] power spoke like a dragon and exercise
[24:48] listen church that's where we're at
[24:51] that's where we're at what's this last
[24:53] few years been about
[24:56] a lamb beginning to take power
[24:58] take away the people's rights
[25:01] are you with me now
[25:03] but we see that and say well i'm gonna
[25:05] get my ak-47 or whatever it is that we
[25:08] fight here with here in america and i'm
[25:09] gonna fight no that's not what the bride
[25:11] does
[25:12] we're going home
[25:14] right when the lamb begins to speak like
[25:16] a dragon we don't look at that and say
[25:18] oh i'm going to join some kind of group
[25:20] and fight against that although although
[25:22] i would be against it too i'd speak out
[25:24] against it but yet when you see that
[25:26] coming we say come lord jesus
[25:28] right that's our escape amen not to
[25:31] fight and throw over overthrow the
[25:33] government not to go out and and shoot
[25:35] one another do something like that but
[25:37] our escape is from glory our escape is
[25:39] to be translated in a moment in a
[25:41] twinkling of an eye
[25:43] that's where we're headed to
[25:46] and the way that this nation is in
[25:48] prophecy and this is what i love about
[25:50] this these things exist at the end time
[25:52] and so if that image of the beast is
[25:54] there and that and the beast that come
[25:56] out of the earth is there that means
[25:58] america can't be destroyed until we
[26:00] leave here
[26:01] because it's here even during the
[26:03] tribulation period
[26:05] amen
[26:06] all that ought to give us confidence to
[26:08] know that we're going to make it amen
[26:11] and the bride won't go through
[26:12] tribulation
[26:15] but now you see the the lamb has to
[26:18] speak like a dragon
[26:19] he said in exercise
[26:21] he said it received power and spoke he
[26:24] said
[26:25] after a while it received power and
[26:26] spoke like a dragon exercised all the
[26:27] power the dragon had before him and the
[26:29] dragon is rome always he said so don't
[26:32] you see roman denomination a mark
[26:35] protestant denomination an image
[26:37] making a power that'll force all
[26:39] protestants like a union
[26:41] he said you'll have to be in this
[26:42] council of churches or you won't be able
[26:44] to have fellowship
[26:46] now watch he said well it's practically
[26:47] that way now
[26:49] you can't go to a church and preach
[26:51] unless you have a fellowship card or
[26:52] some identification
[26:54] he said and now on persons like
[26:55] ourselves
[26:57] we're going to be cut out of all of that
[26:59] altogether
[27:01] you realize where we're at church
[27:03] we've been cut out of all of that
[27:07] right in brother madam's time you could
[27:09] go and preach in denominational churches
[27:12] from time to time but a message preacher
[27:14] today could find no pulpit
[27:18] not preaching the message of the hour
[27:20] you'd find no prophet in a
[27:22] denominational church
[27:24] why because you'd have to have some
[27:26] identification a fellowship card he said
[27:28] we're going to be cut out of all that
[27:30] altogether that's exactly because they
[27:31] won't be able to do it he said it's
[27:34] tightening
[27:35] and then when that time comes
[27:37] and the press comes to a place
[27:40] to where you're pressed out
[27:42] i don't know about you but i feel pretty
[27:44] pressed out
[27:46] i'm not you can't be a part of
[27:48] denominationalism and they're probably
[27:50] many good people you could have friends
[27:51] and we know as we preach about a pocket
[27:53] full of change god's got people
[27:55] everywhere but you can't be a part of
[27:56] that system
[27:58] you've been pressed out of that it used
[28:00] to be maybe you could go to church there
[28:02] and just sit there and now they're going
[28:03] to want to make you a part they're going
[28:05] to get your kids involved they're going
[28:06] to want to enroll you
[28:08] and be a part of it and when you come
[28:10] against you know you can't even get
[28:11] their health care service hardly unless
[28:12] you say you're a trinitarian
[28:15] that's true they wanna they wanna they
[28:17] want you to say that you're a
[28:18] trinitarian to get the healthcare
[28:19] service why because that's that's the
[28:21] hour we live in we've been pressed out
[28:24] he said then watch what i'm fixing to
[28:25] tell you in a few minutes watch the
[28:27] third poll then
[28:28] see he said it'll be absolutely to the
[28:30] total lost
[28:31] but it will be for the bride
[28:34] and the church hallelujah aren't you
[28:36] glad that during this time we have a
[28:38] promise that's what we're looking at
[28:40] right now what is that what is that and
[28:42] you say well it's speaking things into
[28:44] existence yes it is but the third poll
[28:46] is the power of the word among us
[28:49] amen the power of christ among us the
[28:51] power of the word and that's what we
[28:53] have
[28:54] we're not looking for another time yes
[28:56] it'll come greater and greater as we get
[28:58] to the end i believe that but the third
[29:00] poll is what we have
[29:02] we just have to go use it
[29:05] hey man amen so we're not looking for
[29:07] something some other messenger to come
[29:09] or brother random to come back but we'll
[29:11] be for the bride in the church amen
[29:13] we're the bride we've been pressed out
[29:16] we've been cut out from without hands if
[29:18] you could put it like that
[29:20] we've been taken without the form of a
[29:21] denomination we've been taken away from
[29:24] denomination and that's the time that we
[29:26] live in right now but look
[29:27] look at the thing you should be watching
[29:29] and again
[29:30] watch russia brother branham says that
[29:33] watch russia
[29:35] but what should we be watching here in
[29:37] the u.s
[29:39] because the bible says that there will
[29:41] be one that will come in peaceably
[29:43] and obtain the kingdom by flatteries
[29:47] by flatteries
[29:48] and brother branham said about that
[29:50] scripture he said exactly what it done
[29:53] he said that's what daniel said this
[29:55] antichrist would do
[29:57] he will fit the people's
[30:00] place i want you to watch this if you
[30:02] miss everything else that i say tonight
[30:03] i'm not going to hold you along tonight
[30:05] but if you miss everything else i say
[30:07] watch this
[30:08] he said that's what daniel said this
[30:10] antichrist would do he will fit the
[30:12] people's place
[30:14] it'll fit their menu for this day
[30:18] for the churches
[30:20] for in this church age
[30:22] they don't want the word christ
[30:25] but they want church
[30:30] what have we seen every kind of a thing
[30:32] will call itself a church
[30:34] i've seen this thing in near springfield
[30:36] called it courageous church
[30:39] and different ones they've got all kinds
[30:40] of different names for their church
[30:43] and it's seeker sensitive
[30:45] and you go to a church now like you do a
[30:47] fast food restaurant
[30:49] and you go in and you find out if the
[30:51] churches fits your lifestyle and if it
[30:53] fits what you want to hear and if it's
[30:55] if they don't talk about sin too much
[30:57] and if they don't talk about these other
[30:59] things too much if they if they're
[31:00] prosperous if they help you you say what
[31:02] can i get out of it and that's the way
[31:04] people go to church brother branham said
[31:05] that was this age it'll fit their menu
[31:08] for this day for the churches for in
[31:10] this church age they don't want the word
[31:12] christ but they want church
[31:14] the first thing they don't ask you now
[31:16] watch the spirit even comes in around us
[31:19] message people sometimes that they'll
[31:21] begin to tell you things what church
[31:24] they'll ask you they don't ask if you're
[31:25] a christian they say what church you
[31:27] belong to
[31:30] that's even true of us sometimes
[31:34] what church you belong to
[31:36] what church they don't want christ the
[31:37] word
[31:38] he said you go tell them about the word
[31:40] how to straighten up they don't want
[31:41] that
[31:43] they want something just live any way
[31:46] they want to
[31:47] and still belong to church
[31:50] and obtain their testimony
[31:52] i saw something today
[31:54] a person was advertised on social media
[31:56] for a dentist
[31:58] and they said please help i sent it to
[32:00] joel
[32:01] i said please help
[32:03] said i'm looking for a non-judgmental
[32:05] dentist
[32:07] who will work on a person who's scared
[32:08] of dentists
[32:11] for a low cost
[32:13] i said that's what they want from every
[32:15] pastor
[32:18] a non-judgmental pastor
[32:20] a non-judgmental church who will work
[32:23] on people who are scared of church
[32:25] at a low cost to myself
[32:28] but that's not what the bride is looking
[32:30] for
[32:31] the bride is like rebecca she said let
[32:33] me let me give water to the camels let
[32:36] me be apart let me volunteer amen
[32:40] hallelujah they want something just live
[32:43] anyway they want to still belong to
[32:44] church that spirit is so strong and if
[32:47] you go into the feast of the trumpets
[32:49] brother branham's talked about the the
[32:50] spirits that come on the river euphrates
[32:53] and he talked about how that they would
[32:54] come in an ecclesiastical realm and he
[32:57] goes back to this again and he says
[32:58] it'll be something like that where just
[33:01] pr just live any way you want to and
[33:02] still go to church
[33:04] that's the deception of this age and it
[33:06] creeps right in among us
[33:09] until i've had people sit there and tell
[33:11] me well it doesn't matter what i do i i
[33:14] i should be able to go to church i
[33:15] should be able to well you can go
[33:17] anywhere you want to but you're going
[33:18] you're going to hear it
[33:22] you're going to hear it when if you're
[33:24] looking for non-judgmental and you've
[33:25] got things that need to be judged then
[33:27] church is not the place for you not a
[33:29] real church
[33:30] because the church is a judgment seat
[33:34] god wants to judge that judge is not a
[33:36] bad word he wants to take it out of your
[33:38] life
[33:39] he wants to remove it amen
[33:43] so that's where the way antichrist comes
[33:45] in
[33:46] he said he fits the menu just exactly
[33:48] remember he was finally called she in
[33:50] the bible and she was a prostitute had
[33:52] daughters just fits the bill of the day
[33:54] what the people wants
[33:56] there it is now here's the statement
[33:57] you'll find brother branham say over and
[33:59] over and over and over again in the
[34:00] message he'll say don't be afraid of
[34:02] russia
[34:05] or something to that effect don't be
[34:07] afraid of communism
[34:09] he'll and he'll say something like this
[34:11] he uses this
[34:12] this over and over again in the message
[34:14] maybe a hundred times several dozens of
[34:17] times anyway
[34:18] he said it ain't the robin that pecks on
[34:20] the apple that hurts it
[34:22] it's the worm at the core
[34:25] he said i ain't scared of russia's
[34:27] atomic bombs no indeed
[34:29] why our own rottenness
[34:31] is what's killing us
[34:38] and we've seen that too haven't we
[34:40] where are we at church
[34:42] our own rottenness it's now legal to be
[34:44] married to someone of the same gender
[34:46] that's it's crazy
[34:49] it's insane
[34:52] it is absolutely insanity little
[34:54] children choosing their gender in school
[34:58] it's insane
[35:01] women
[35:02] taking their babies going around and and
[35:04] and messing around all that they want to
[35:06] and then taking the babies and killing
[35:08] the babies it's worse than the romans
[35:10] because we subsidize it
[35:12] with taxpayer dollars
[35:14] it's a barbaric system
[35:19] are you hearing me tonight
[35:20] where are we at
[35:22] we've got churches that don't want to
[35:24] ever hear anything about sin no one ever
[35:26] hear anything about what's going on our
[35:28] own rottenness is killing us
[35:31] but the bride has heard a voice
[35:34] that said come out of her my people be
[35:36] not partaker of her plagues oh aren't
[35:38] you glad you've heard that voice
[35:40] you heard a voice and you didn't hear
[35:42] just an earthly voice but you heard a
[35:44] voice from heaven but the matter said
[35:46] the voice of predestination speaking to
[35:48] your heart come out of her my people oh
[35:51] have you heard that voice tonight oh
[35:53] that that stirs me up tonight because i
[35:55] realized what a thing it's like i've
[35:56] been throwing a life raft i'm out here
[35:58] in the middle of a turbulent sea here is
[36:00] russia over here here's all the things
[36:03] going on over here and all the all the
[36:05] gay marriage and everything the world is
[36:07] seeking america is sinking russia is
[36:09] sinking going straight towards a nuclear
[36:11] war and here a life raft's been thrown
[36:14] out called the message of the hour amen
[36:16] god sent you a boat that you could get
[36:18] in and you could go all the way to the
[36:20] shore that you would not only not go
[36:22] down with him but you would go up with
[36:24] him
[36:26] hallelujah aren't you glad
[36:28] amen
[36:30] amen i didn't intend to preach tonight
[36:32] just talk about these things but
[36:34] oh it's been wonderful
[36:36] isn't it wonderful
[36:38] here you were just swimming around in
[36:39] the sea the cesspool and god sent you a
[36:42] way of escape
[36:44] he loved you so much
[36:46] that he chose you to come out of the age
[36:50] hallelujah
[36:52] oh he said brother brandon said the word
[36:55] of that little lamb that rose up in
[36:56] revelation 13 a lamb
[36:58] he said probably a little horn civil and
[37:00] ecclesiastical power
[37:03] but after islam freedom of religion and
[37:05] so forth
[37:06] but after a while he spake like a beast
[37:09] like the dragon and exercised all the
[37:11] power the dragon did before him a bitter
[37:13] religious persecution
[37:15] we're nearing that time
[37:18] and here's the quote that brother
[37:19] stewart read on sunday afternoon that
[37:21] was so striking he said do you remember
[37:23] church that you're living in the best
[37:25] day that you'll ever live in
[37:27] right now this is in 1951.
[37:30] he said until jesus comes it shall
[37:31] gradually he said not gradually but
[37:33] rapidly get worse
[37:35] and worse
[37:37] and again brother stewart read this but
[37:39] it's such a striking quote but the
[37:40] brandon said when russia goes down there
[37:41] to get that oil look out i'm not going
[37:43] to pretend i understand what exactly
[37:45] what that means
[37:46] but i do know that
[37:48] russia is headed towards israel
[37:52] the king of the north is headed towards
[37:54] israel over time
[37:56] it's what he does it's where he's going
[37:58] that's the goal he may not even know it
[38:01] but he's going to come against jerusalem
[38:04] that's the bible
[38:06] and so he said when russia goes down
[38:07] there to get that oil look out that's
[38:08] all she needs he said that's what the
[38:10] prophet said it would do
[38:12] and we're ready for it
[38:14] then now
[38:16] i think i put some maps on here and i'm
[38:17] not sure that i can even read them
[38:20] but uh if you could peter if you could
[38:22] put that one in the middle might be a
[38:23] little bit easier to read
[38:25] but
[38:25] uh if you look at
[38:28] the map
[38:29] of
[38:30] russia is up to the north on this one if
[38:32] you go back to the previous map
[38:34] russia is up to the north on this one
[38:36] and you can see that israel is down here
[38:39] on the on the left side
[38:41] and if you see iraq and iran there in
[38:43] turkey turkey is in between russia and
[38:45] israel russia is not very far from
[38:47] israel there's no sea
[38:49] separating russia from israel in fact a
[38:51] few years ago you remember they went in
[38:53] and took over georgia
[38:55] which is not our georgia where they got
[38:57] all the
[38:58] the guns and bad football but the uh
[39:01] the green area there is georgia
[39:04] a country the country of georgia and
[39:05] russia has already taken that
[39:07] and so all that stands between them
[39:09] because they're already in syria they've
[39:10] taken russia practically runs syria and
[39:14] so all this between them is turkey
[39:16] and then on the other side if you go to
[39:18] that next
[39:19] that next slide
[39:21] on the other side where they're going
[39:23] now is ukraine ukraine is to the west
[39:25] but it's the last it's the buffer
[39:27] country belarus there actually is a
[39:29] dictator there that's a puppet of
[39:31] putin's
[39:32] and then ukraine is below that and the
[39:35] puppet there in belarus was standing in
[39:37] front of the invasion map of moldova the
[39:39] other day
[39:40] every saw that in the news
[39:43] the dictator was literally standing
[39:44] there saying i'm not going to fight no
[39:45] war he's standing in front of a map that
[39:47] shows invasion plans for moldova
[39:51] they're not going to stop at ukraine
[39:53] not if they get what they want right and
[39:56] so they're going to keep going down
[39:58] where where are they headed to well
[40:00] eventually i don't that's a they could
[40:01] go either direction but eventually
[40:03] they're going to end up
[40:04] in israel
[40:06] you say how do you say that well brother
[40:09] branham said this he said again russia
[40:11] he called it king of the north he said
[40:12] how many has heard me just say he said
[40:14] just wave that over and over the old
[40:16] timers he said you see back in the early
[40:18] part of the church just stand there and
[40:20] wave it over and over watch russia the
[40:22] king of the north
[40:24] king of the north see what he would do
[40:26] for all those isms will heap up into
[40:28] russia
[40:30] daniel chapter 11 and verse 40 is where
[40:32] he takes that from and and if you'll go
[40:35] you can go and read daniel chapter 11
[40:36] the entire chapter but he said at the
[40:38] time of the end shall the king of the
[40:40] south push at him
[40:43] now i don't know what this could be but
[40:44] think about it could be sanctions
[40:47] the king of the south pushes we don't
[40:48] know who the king of the south is in
[40:50] that prophecy in the old testament it
[40:51] was commonly egypt
[40:54] but we don't know who that is but
[40:56] we could say these western powers push
[40:58] at him and the king of the north shall
[41:00] come against him like a whirlwind with
[41:02] chariots with horsemen with many ships
[41:05] and he shall enter into the countries
[41:09] watch the countries
[41:11] not don't just stop at one
[41:13] you shall enter into the countries and
[41:15] shall overflow
[41:17] and pass
[41:18] over
[41:20] now brother branham says daniel is given
[41:22] this assurance at the end of the gentile
[41:24] dispensation he said read when you go
[41:25] home the 11th chapter he said you can
[41:28] see how the king of the north is coming
[41:30] down which is nothing else but russia
[41:32] coming down to press against it like a
[41:34] whirlwind and the great battle of
[41:36] armageddon will be fought right there
[41:39] near the gates of jerusalem
[41:41] it's like reading a newspaper in advance
[41:46] right you realize all these thousands of
[41:48] years ago was prophesied the king of the
[41:50] north and we're seeing it
[41:53] now look and again like i said i don't
[41:55] know they could be stopped for a while
[41:57] we don't know what the purposes of god
[41:58] are
[42:00] they could be beaten back but it will
[42:02] happen one day
[42:04] this could be it it could be ten years
[42:05] from now it could be a hundred years
[42:07] from now but it'll happen one day
[42:10] he said and the great battle of
[42:11] armageddon will be fought right there
[42:13] near the gates
[42:15] of jerusalem
[42:17] revelation 16 12 let's just go there and
[42:19] look at in revelation before we close
[42:21] revelation 16 12 the sixth angel poured
[42:24] out his vial upon the great river
[42:26] euphrates the water thereof was dried up
[42:28] but the way of the kings of the east
[42:30] might be prepared and i saw three
[42:33] unclean spirits like frogs come out of
[42:35] the mouth of the dragon out of the mouth
[42:36] of the beast
[42:37] out of the mouth of the false prophet
[42:39] now
[42:40] random typed those three unclean spirits
[42:41] early in his ministry to the three isms
[42:43] communism fascism nazism later on he
[42:46] typed him to trinitarian spirits a
[42:48] trinity of spirits or a trinitarian
[42:50] doctrine
[42:51] and then but then he said it would be
[42:53] the false prophet and the beast
[42:55] and and the dragon he said those three
[42:57] unclean spirits come out
[42:59] he said and they influence they
[43:01] influence what do they do the bible says
[43:04] they are the spirits of devils working
[43:05] miracles which go forth unto the kings
[43:08] of the earth and of the whole world to
[43:11] gather them to the battle of that great
[43:13] day of god almighty
[43:15] they don't know putin doesn't know they
[43:17] say is he insane why is he doing what
[43:19] he's doing
[43:20] could it be that one of these spirits
[43:22] have influenced him
[43:25] are you with me now the spirits brother
[43:27] brandon said it was just like nazism and
[43:29] communism but the brandon taught us
[43:31] communism was a spirit that's why when
[43:33] somebody becomes a communist you can't
[43:35] reason out of it
[43:36] it's a spirit
[43:38] and the communism is the spirit and
[43:39] these things are spirits through the
[43:40] spirits of devils but brother branham
[43:43] taught us and you go you can go look it
[43:44] up but these spirits are manifested when
[43:46] the seals were open he said until the
[43:48] seals came open the spirits could not be
[43:50] manifested the three unclean spirits
[43:52] like frogs but now that they now they
[43:54] are
[43:55] oh church if we could just realize the
[43:57] hour that we're living in if they could
[43:58] not be manifested the bride could not be
[44:00] manifested until the seals were open but
[44:02] here we are
[44:04] right those unclean spirits amen are
[44:07] going into the kings of the world to
[44:09] gather them to armageddon but the spirit
[44:11] of god is going into the bride together
[44:14] heard of the marriage supper
[44:16] oh isn't it wonderful
[44:19] now
[44:20] he said they're the spirits of devils go
[44:22] forth to the kings of the earth end of
[44:23] the whole world to gather them into the
[44:25] battle the great day of god almighty
[44:28] notice what he says striking revelation
[44:30] 16 15 the next verse behold i come as a
[44:34] thief
[44:35] blessed is he that watcheth and keepeth
[44:37] his garments lest he walk naked and they
[44:40] see his shame
[44:42] you know what this is talking about is a
[44:44] soldier that would be on guard on the
[44:46] temple wall
[44:48] and he would be standing on the guard
[44:50] and and sometimes because of the
[44:53] the country there in jerusalem was so
[44:55] dry
[44:56] and and so
[44:57] uh so hot
[44:59] that at night in order to sleep they
[45:00] would take out their take off their
[45:02] outer garment and and and lay down
[45:05] and if they're laying down asleep
[45:07] they're not watching
[45:09] right and this man was responsible
[45:12] and actually what they would do to him
[45:14] when they caught him in that condition
[45:16] is if they've caught you without your
[45:18] clothes on
[45:19] right and and you laid down for the
[45:21] night instead of watching they would
[45:23] make you march back to your house
[45:25] without your clothes
[45:27] because that's why it says lest he walk
[45:29] naked
[45:30] and they see his shame he's marching
[45:32] back without his clothes on because he
[45:34] was caught on in a watchman's position
[45:37] but he wasn't watching
[45:39] so he says blessed is he that watcheth
[45:41] so it's good that we look at these
[45:43] things
[45:44] it's good that we see when we see
[45:45] armageddon when we see things shaping up
[45:47] for armageddon it's good that we keep
[45:49] our word garments around us and stay
[45:52] awake
[45:53] don't let the world don't let laodicea
[45:55] lull you to sleep make you think you're
[45:58] okay but stay with us with a reveal for
[46:01] repentance a seal for god a seal if
[46:03] there ever was a time we ought to have a
[46:05] seal for the house of god it ought to be
[46:06] this hour if there ever was a time we
[46:09] ought to have a passion for lost souls
[46:10] it ought to be this hour if there ever
[46:12] was a time that we had a a desire in our
[46:15] heart to to see the word of god
[46:17] manifested it ought to be this hour
[46:21] amen
[46:22] blessed are they
[46:24] that watch and keep their garments
[46:27] hallelujah
[46:28] and he gathered them together
[46:30] into a place called in the hebrew tongue
[46:33] armageddon
[46:34] and the seventh angel poured out his
[46:36] violin to the air this is it
[46:38] when that happens that's it
[46:41] there came a great voice out of the
[46:42] temple of heaven
[46:44] from the throne saying it is done
[46:47] it's all over
[46:48] the last angel pours out his vial
[46:52] and there were voices and thunders and
[46:53] lightnings
[46:55] there was a great earthquake
[46:56] such as was not since men were upon the
[46:58] earth so mighty and earthquake and so
[47:00] great
[47:02] and the great city was divided into
[47:03] three parts
[47:05] and the cities of the nations fell
[47:08] and great babylon came in remembrance
[47:10] before god
[47:11] given to her the cup of the wine of the
[47:13] fierceness of his wrath
[47:15] you can go to revelation 17 and 18 and
[47:18] it speaks of the judgment of the great
[47:19] and her daughters that's set on
[47:21] seven hills which we know is rome and
[47:24] then the protestant denominations
[47:27] and then in revelation 19 1 he said
[47:28] after these things
[47:30] i'm so glad there's an after
[47:33] i heard a great voice of much people in
[47:35] heaven
[47:36] where did they come from
[47:39] when all this is going on on the earth
[47:41] and they see the smoke rising up from
[47:42] babylon where are the people in heaven
[47:45] where do they come from that's us
[47:50] hallelujah it ain't a quiet bunch either
[47:53] because they just saw rome destroyed
[47:55] they just saw the things that that were
[47:57] prophesied in scripture take place and
[47:59] they said hallelujah salvation and glory
[48:01] and honor and power unto the lord our
[48:03] god
[48:04] for true and righteous are his judgments
[48:06] free it judged the great which did
[48:08] corrupt the earth for their fornication
[48:09] and has avenged the blood of his
[48:10] servants at her hand where they had in
[48:12] heaven they went left in the rapture
[48:14] before the events of armageddon
[48:17] aren't you glad the bible is so correct
[48:19] where are we at
[48:20] before that first bomb falls we gotta
[48:22] get out of here
[48:26] hallelujah before jerusalem is compassed
[48:29] about with harmings we have to leave
[48:36] oh my and then if you go down to
[48:37] revelation 19 11 it said i saw heaven
[48:39] opened
[48:40] behold a white horse he that set upon
[48:42] him was called faithful and true
[48:44] and then righteousness righteousness he
[48:46] does judge and make war oh i we've seen
[48:49] all this killing of civilians and all
[48:51] these things and all the tricks that
[48:53] they have nations have up their sleeves

[48:56] kill one another but here comes the king
