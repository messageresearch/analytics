you glad for his love and his mercy and his grace amen we all need did don't we amen let's bow our heads together for just a moment maybe you've got a special unspoken request you'd like to make known tonight we've uplifted hand God sees all of those needs and knows what's On Your Heart Tonight Heavenly Father we're so thankful Lord to be able to gather together once again Lord we may have needs but we know that you meet our needs we know that Lord because you promised us in your word and Lord also because you have always done it in the past P I'm so thankful Lord for past blessings tonight's another night I pray God that you just move in a mighty way I pray Lord maybe there be some area you'd like to address tonight maybe with me maybe with someone else I pray that you'd move me out of the way and do that Lord speak through us and to us oh God hear through US Lord and we'll give you the praise and the glory and the honor for it foray you'd meet every need now in Jesus name amen amen amen let's go back to the Book of Genesis Genesis 37 Genesis 37 and3 we're going to talk about Joseph again and tonight we're going to deal with uh Joseph as Jacob's favorite Jacob's favorite Genesis 373 it's good good crowd tonight it's good to have you all on a Wednesday night Genesis 373 says now is Israel loved Joseph more than all his children because he was the son of his old age and he made him a coat of many colors and when his Brethren saw that their father loved him more than all his Brethren they hated him and could not speak peaceably unto him pray the Lord would add his Blessing to the word you may be seated favoritism is the disposition ition to favor Aid and promote the interest of a favorite or of one person or family or of one class of people to the neglect of others having equal claims and I want to you to understand tonight that nothing Jacob or Joseph did especially nothing that Joseph did excuses Joseph's brothers selling him into slavery and lying to their father but it does help explain why a reason is not an excuse there was no excuse for what they did to Joseph and Joseph in fact they hated him without a cause they didn't even know why they hated him but they were fulfilling a type of Christ who was to come who was hated by his Brethren without a cause and yet here was a a young man and and his brothers that hated him and if you look at the family you begin to see that there are reasons why this was going on the way that it was and and it was actually as I said a foreshadowing of God's favor being on Jesus Christ but it still caused problems in the family we know that Joseph's brothers felt like they were second rate because of the attention that was paid to Joseph by Jacob we know that Jacob was a prophet of God a righteous man and he had had many great experiences with God but yet he had trouble at home and that that happens sometimes sometimes we we have trouble even though we're living for the Lord and we're doing everything we can and yet we also see that Jacob at times backslid and did things that were wrong and I think that speaks to all of us as well we've all made mistakes and and God's prophets even in their personal lives sometimes make mistakes and do things that are wrong but the word is never wrong and the word comes to the prophet but sometimes the man can be wrong and so we find that uh Jacob made some mistakes and it actually predates him it goes back to his mother and father because these things usually do and it goes back to Isaac and Rebecca and Genesis 25:27 it says the boys grew speaking of of Jacob and his brother Esau and Esau was a cunning Hunter a man of the field and Jacob was a plain man dwelling in tents and Isaac loved Esau because he did eat of his venison but Rebecca loved Jacob you ever seen a family like that so dad's got his favorite and mom's got her favorite and that favoritism bred jealousy in the in the eyes of the other one because of of them being their favorite so we know that God doesn't do that and we know that it's wrong to play favorites among your children we know that Isaac and Rebecca should have should have treated them both equally because they were both their children now brother brandom even tells us that the reason you can go look it up he said the reason the sign of the son of man had to be shown to the Gentiles is that God treats all his children the same he treats the Jews the same as the Samaritans the same as the Gentiles and so he said that he treated them all equally now I know you know maybe you're thinking in your mind because now we're going to deal with something uh that goes beyond just family relations and you begin to think then if that's so why did God say that he hated Esau you find that in Malachi chapter 3 that he hated Esau these These are wonderful uh whoever's running these the the that's real nice but just turn them down just a little bit I feel like I'm yelling tonight but it sounds real good so he said he said he hated Esau right and and you say well God's playing favorites between Jacob and Esau but he's not and the reason is because they are not both God's children children right one has a seed the other one doesn't now look at Romans chapter 9 and: 10 where Paul explains this he said not only this but when Rebecca also had conceived by one even by her father Isaac for the children being not yet born neither having done any good or evil that the purpose of God according to election might stand not of works but of him that calleth it was said unto her the Elder Shall Serve the younger as it is written Jacob have I loved but Esau have I hated so now if you begin to look at that real closely if you were Jacob early on especially in his life you might want to be loved A little bit less by God because Jacob went through some things and he was born second now you know it'd be easy for Jacob to say well God if you love me why didn't you let me be born first right let me get the birthright without having to con my brother out of it right I mean you you kind of think like that if you were Jacob you might think like uh if you've ever seen the play or the film Fiddler on the Roof where where where the star of the of the show the man the Jewish man there is saying he's talking to God as he does throughout the film and he says he says I know I know we're we're your chosen people he said but once in a while can't you choose someone else because the Jews have asked that question over the years why why did you choose us you chose us for suffer uer in you chose us you you you singled us out whenever we say we're your chosen people people get mad and and and they and they uh they persecute us and so why can't you just go choose somebody else but you can't change God's choosing and and material blessings are no sign of God's choosing church sometimes you it's a it's a better sign that you're chosen not because you're materially blessed but because you're going through some things in fact brother brandom tells us and we just read it a few services ago he said that he said that actually the church that isn't suffering hasn't got it I know people are always looking for a reason look at saying well must be something wrong because there's some suffering going on and people are going through some things we don't need to look at it like that God allows those things to perfect our character and to get us ready to leave here because he's much more interested in what in who we really are than he is in our bank account or or even how healthy we are though I believe he's interested in those things but much more interested in our character so material blessings are no sign of election and you see that in The Story of Lazarus and the rich man Romans 9:14 what shall we say then and and the reverse is also True by the way before we get too far down that road just because you're poor don't mean you're elected right just because you're rich don't mean you aren't it's just harder to get to heaven but say Lord give me more hardship but but you know it's true you you can't go by that now look what what do you go by he said what should we say then is there unrighteousness with God in other words it's God a parent who favors one over another God forbid for he sayth to Moses I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion so then it is not of him that willth nor of him that runneth but of God that showeth mercy so being born into a family is not by choice you were born and you were part of that family we were part of God's family in his mind before the foundation of the world and he had a right to have that family now listen they were both Isaac's children Esau and Jacob they were both Abraham's seed but they were not both seed of God so brother brandom says it this way he said way back there too far back for the human mind to grasp the Eternal god with eternal thoughts thought and Creed Jacob have I loved but Esau have I hated and neither was born and neither had done good or evil boy I enjoy preaching this because it just tells you how much it's not us that does it but it's God that does it he said see it was the thought and then that thought became expressed and God bought back Jacob Oh my he redeemed Jacob bought him back because Jacob alone was seed Jacob alone had the seed that is why he had respect to the birthright and Covenant of God because he had the seed now watch what is it about you that denotes that you are the elect it's the respect that you have for the birthright and the Covenant of God it's not because you never went through anything it's not because you didn't have a bad past it's not because you you were raised just right and everything went just well in your life no that don't mean that you're the elect but what tells you that you're the elect because there's something in you that won't let you give up you got respect to the birthright you got respect for the Holy Ghost there's something in you that says I must have it no matter what it takes no matter what I got to go through I'm going to be saved and you find yourself like the sarap phenician woman who come to Jesus and she said and he told her he said it's not meat for me to take the children's bread and give it to dogs and she said that's the truth Lord but the dogs eat the crumbs that fall from the master's table so the the elect goes through every obstacle to become elect and I don't want to get too graphic but it works that way in the natural as well that that seed that's going to live overcomes every obstacle to become the person oh church and the seed that's going to live in the in the spiritual realm overcomes every obstacle to become the child of God Amen now this doesn't only apply to Jacob it it applies to us in 2 Thessalonians 21:13 we are bound to give thanks always to God for you you Brethren beloved of the Lord because God hath from where from the beginning yes chosen you so you can say you're God's favorite right but all God's children are his favorites that's right he has chosen you to Salvation through sanctification of the spirit and belief of the Truth where to he called you by Our Gospel to the obtaining of the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ Christ so his children are chosen they're not accidents right and you need to you know you young people especially you need to quit letting the devil beat you up on that right you're not an accident you're not here by chance you're you're not in church because you just happen to be born in a message family you're you're not serving the lord because things just happen to fall that way and maybe you'd be Buddhist if they didn't but God called you in spite of everything he called you and brought you in the family you were born in and brought you in the church that you come to and did all that to make you his elect you can't help but be the elect of God there's something on the inside of you he has called you what is it he's chosen you from the beginning from the beginning he chose you to be his seed to be his children I'm I'm so glad for that tonight War Two he called you by Our Gospel to the obtaining of the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ his children are chosen they're the very expression of his mind Ephesians 1:3 blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings and Heavenly places in Christ according as he hath chosen listen past tense I know this hard for people to understand but it's important that we understand it right and this is the scripture he has chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he has made us accepted in the Beloved the reason you can go to church and be accepted in the Beloved is because of his choosing he called you he Sanctified you he'll change your body one day you have represent presentation in heaven listen God's not playing favorites he has a family and he's responsible for that family now we think that's strange but you know if you went out to eat you don't pay for the whole restaurant every time you go you might do that once in a while but you you know you you say well God has unlimited resources but he still has a right to have a family and the Plan of Redemption doesn't work unless there's a pharaoh it doesn't work unless there unless there is different a handful of change as brother Brandon put it change in his pocket that he's got some silver dollars some half dollars some quarters some dimes and some pennies and it's all in God's economy and and how does that work why how does God choose well he chooses in himself he chooses in himself it's not anything that you do you don't work your way into that and he has a family and he's responsible for you you say well how do I ever know that I'm part of that family because he doesn't call those who are not part of his family if he's called you he doesn't call God doesn't work like we do he knows everything amen right and he's not calling you hoping that one day respond and sitting there thinking I remember in the wesle church we used to say that well if you if you don't come to the altar your Mansion will be empty in heaven there's not going to be a bunch of vacant mansions in heaven right and that's the Pentecostal doctrine of it is that there you know God just you know he loved everybody but he just he sitting there and just wasn't able God if he wanted to could could save everybody right and yet and yet he does will that no man should perish but there's a difference in his family and those who get to choose life or death that does that make sense and and the truth is on your side on looking at it from our perspective we all get a choice and we all need to make a choice so from our perspective we look at what God is doing us doing to us and we say Lord I see you calling me I see you pulling me I see your word and you said repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins I'm going to believe that I'm going to follow that and what does that do for you that means you're saved believe on the name of the Lord Jesus Christ thou and thy house shall be saved what is he saying you're saved but you I don't want to get bogged down in this but I feel a little bit you know I feel like we don't understand it like we should I feel like I don't understand it like I should but but God's not playing favorites God is saying that if you come to him when he calls you you are you are his and yet there will be many others that have a different part in his economy so we don't we don't look at other people as if well you're just a dog or you're just a uh you're just a uh you're just Canon F or something like that though it may actually be true we don't look at it that way we don't know who is seed and who is not and we don't know who's going to be in heaven and who is not right I don't want to get into that tonight but there'll be many people that are not seed of God that'll be in heaven ask me how I know how do you know brother Ben because the prophet of God said so and the Bible said so right he separated the sheep from the goats many people who come to the white Throne judgment be saved and mean it'll be lost Luke 15:4 says it this way and I want to just Hammer this point home and then we'll move on he said what man of you having a hundred sheep if you lose one of them do not leave the 90 and N in the wilderness and go after that which is lost till he find it now look at the picture I know this is always preached as as going out after the Lost Sinner and that's true but look they were his to begin with he had 100 it's a number right he didn't have 101 he didn't have 999 he had 100 right and so he has 100 sheep and let's say that I'm one of those sheep or you're one of those sheep and the other 99 doing pretty good but we get out in the weed somewhere get lost right we're lost as far as our perspective we're lost but now look what he say he goes after that which is lost until he find it and when he has found it when he has found found it not that the Sheep if makes its way back to the fold but it's the shepherd who goes out and gets the sheep in the oh that's my story in the condition that it's in and he goes out into the Wilderness and he finds the sheep in their lost condition and he grabs a hold of it puts it on his shoulders oh which is the strongest part of him amen and when he and rejoicing and when he cometh home he calleth together his friends and neighbors saying unto them Rejoice with me not that I for I have not added to my Sheepfold I have not found another sheep found someone willing are you with me now but he said I have found my sheep one of the 100 which was lost we're his sheep even before we were saved right John 17 And1 boy I don't have time to get into all this tonight we may have to cut some of this off John 17:1 we haven't gone very far but we got a lot to go but I I don't ever hold you long on Wednesday and I won't tonight Lord willing praise the Lord that ought at least got a chuckle out of you John 17:1 let's look at this just the plain words of scripture these words spake Jesus lifted up his eyes to heaven and said father the hour is come glorify thy son that thy son Also may glorify thee as thou has given him Power Over All Flesh that he should give eternal life listen to this this is strong meat to as many as thou Hast given him the 100 are you with me now or whatever number is in God's mind we don't know what that is but however many are in God's mind he said he said you will give eternal life to his many as thou Hast given him and this is life eternal that they may Know Thee the only true God in in Jesus Christ whom thou Hast sent I have glorified thee on the earth I have finished the work which thou gavest me to do and now oh Father glorify thou me with thine own self with the glory which I had with thee before the world was manifested thy name again unto the men which thou gavest me out of the world so there's a separation he said you gave me some men out of the world thine they were Peter was God right when he was in the boat fishing before he met Jesus thine they were and thou gavest them me and they have kept Thy word now they have known that all things whatsoever thou H has given me are of thee so in other words I can't give them eternal life unless they come from you are you with me now he said for I have given unto them The Words which thou gavest me and they have received them you want to know what the evidence of the Holy Ghost is there it is and I have known surely that I come out from thee and they have believed that thou did send me I pray for them this is a startling statement I pray not for the world right but for them which thou has given me for they are thine that's not favoritism it's God choosing a family John 1712 he said while I was with them in the world I kept them in my name or in thy name those that thou gavest me I have kept kept and none of them is lost but the son of predition that the scripture might be fulfilled none of them is lost he said these are my responsibility are you with me now so it's not possible for us as finite beings to go out and pay for everybody's meal every time we go out to eat it's not possible but there are those that we're responsible for and God has those that are his responsibility even though he cares for all he sends the sunshine on the elect and the non-elect right he sends the the rain and and the ability to eat and and the ability to even have a good life that if they follow the uh if they follow the tenants of scripture you realize that even the non-elect if they paid tithes if they if they if they had a moral life and a good life they would be blessed in that right because of doing that they'd be blessed even for helping the elect they'd be blessed for being a being a being a good person or something like that they'll be blessed in this life though they may be lost in the end right but they'd be blessed in this life and there'll be even some saved in the end but but it isn't favoritism for him to say I I'm just going to I'm going to just take care of my own family in this way it's not that he's favoring one child over another but some of them are his children and some of them are not but among his children I want you to understand this tonight we're all the same yeah right yes right Galatians 3:26 for you are all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus right so we are not there's no difference in God's children what does that tell me it tells me that if Peter prays and asks God for healing he can receive it right if if if one brother Paul prays and ask God for healing or for the Salvation of his children he receives it by faith the same as anybody else does right right because we are the children of God by faith for as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ there is neither Jew nor Greek there is neither Bond nor free there's neither male nor female for you you are all one in Christ Jesus and if you be Christ then are you Abraham's seed and airs according to the promise so in God when it comes to our Salvation now we're not talking about our different pasts we'll look at that in just a minute maybe but we're not talking about our our gifts or things we do or things we're allowed to do we're talking about in Christ we're all the same if you're a seed of God you have as much of God's uh favor as any other seed of God so it's not like Joseph is is the favored one and you're one of the others but Jesus came and died not so he could just remain the favored but so that you and I could be favored as well and Joseph's Brethren didn't understand this they didn't understand that Joseph wasn't being the favorite he wasn't being made the favorite because uh by pharaoh and even by potier and even in the prison he wasn't made the favorite because these men just had partiality he was made the favor because God had a future use that was actually going to be to their salvation and you were made God's favorite as the elect to be a a help to the world around you to be a blessing to God's people to be a blessing even to the world even those who are the non-elect Christ was made his favorite so that he could bring many sons are you with me now brother Brenham said I I say it humbly before my little church like this I couldn't say it out in big meetings because they'd pick at it and so forth but as a Seer who God shows Visions he said that's not makes me any more than a drunkard that was converted 10 minutes ago somewhere now we wouldn't listen to a drunkard that was converted 10 minutes ago preach that's just the truth brother brand said we don't believe in that right that's right but he's just just as much a Christian as anybody else that's right he's a Christian the same as I am go to the same Heaven enjoy the same blessings and things that I would or anybody else there's no great people and big people the kingdom of God we're all one try everybody just the same person brothers and sisters you say well I know more than everybody else well praise God God must have given you an extra special gift of knowledge share it with somebody help somebody else with it because if it doesn't help anybody it doesn't do any good it's not doing you any good right he said whether we're yellow black white whatever we are We Are One in Christ Jesus there's no DD dou L's and little bitty fellow deacons and janitors right maybe that's the same person sometimes but whatever they are they're all the same in Christ Jesus right we we get we listen I don't like to see I don't like to see a divide and and I'm just telling you my heart I don't like to see a divide between those that have money and those that don't those that those that have bet good clothes and those that don't I don't like to see that we were we're one in Christ Jesus those of us who have been blessing to help those who are less fortunate because we're one in Christ Jesus we're not one above the other that's why we're brother and sisters in the Lord Jesus Christ now that doesn't mean we all have the same job or the same calling because gifts and callings are without repentance but when it comes to the promises whatever God did for one of his children he'll do it for you amen I'm not Abraham but I believe God's my provider right I'm not Abraham but I believe he's still Jehovah Gyra I'm not Paul but I believe God still saves a person who's going the wrong direction and pulls him out and and turns him in another Direction I'm not any of these men I'm not Joseph but if I'm thrown in a pit I believe God's going to bring me out of it because God treats all of his children the same Isaac's favoritism was wrong Jacob's was worse because Jacob and we're going to turn a corner we just headed down one way and I'm going to turn the car go the other direction Jacobs was worse he had a favorite wife we find Jacob serving seven years for Rachel you all know the story Leah was no fault of her own by the way her father did it tricked Jacob as Jacob had tricked so many people in the past and her father had come around to bite him her father tricked Jacob into marrying Leah instead of Rachel knowing he could get Jacob to work longer for Rachel and Jacob loved Rachel so much they seemed into him but a few days for the love he had to her now look polygamy was legal in those days it's not today it was legal but it wasn't good it was never good for the family why favoritism there was always going to be one that was the favorite that's why we teach marriage between one man and one woman for eternity right and I know Church it gets gets real quiet when you talk about marriage and divorce but it shouldn't because we've been given Grace in our day and hour no matter what our past has been God God gave us Grace he told us he said stay as you are right don't do that thing again right teach your children the truth but listen to what he said about it he said first before the beginning from the beginning there was just one in one I told you we were turning a sharp corner but we're going somewhere he said after the sin came in then there was one man and a bunch of women he said run that way in nature every animal human being is in natural flesh is animal we are mammal we know that all of us see he said it's all all God's nature and continuity but now you see the you see where what he's taking you to but now that the seals are open it's a continuation of the same quote he said the spirit of Truth directs us to the word yes right that's what Jesus was doing when the Pharisees asked him is it lawful for a man to put away his wife for any reason he said in the beginning God made them male and female in the beginning God made one and one right now look he said he said that explains why all the mistakes has been down to the ages because the seals was not opened this was not revealed so those that don't believe the seals are open I guess they can go ahead but for those of us who believe the seals are open we're going back one man and one woman right yeah well we're not all the way back because there will comeing time we're going to be in redeemed bodies new bodies we want to worry about none of this stuff no more but let while while we're here I believe we're still here we come to a place of maturity where we don't have to be going around men are not creatures that are just you know they just have to lust and they have to run after women and they have to cheat on their wives and commit adultery on no that that's nonsense right we we don't we're not animals anymore we're not we're not something controls that animal nature right the human part may be like an animal it may be a mammal but there's something inside of you that controls that you don't have to give in to that just cuz you're a man you can live honest and right with your wife and and stay with her and I'll tell our young people again that we believe in one man and one woman for eternity and you treat that person different if you believe that's the only one you ever get a chance with there's commitment there it's a message of Grace though I'm so glad for that but God took notice of how Leah was treated because there's unfairness partiality right and again I say one man one woman for eternity but Paul explains it if spouse dies obviously if you're a widow or widower you got a right to get remarried on in this life and ask me how that works in heaven I'm not sure brother brandom tells a story about a dream he had about it but it just not real clear to me but somehow or another brother brand say if you get the wrong one you'll end up with the right one I don't know how that works say brother Ben which one's the right one right now the One You're With guarantee you that but again don't let that you you know makes us feel bad sometimes I know many times good people Holy Ghost filled people because they've had problems in their marriage they feel bad about that I say God God give you a a spirit of Grace that you can say Lord I accept the grace of this message that brought me out because I didn't know any better but now I know better and I'm a saved as anybody else are you with me now now look Leah ends up having six Sons and a daughter because God opens Leah's womb because he sees the favoritism towards Rachel and Leah had six Sons and a daughter and they had four other Sons born to concubines because the family was just a mess and there's competition going on between the women right thank God for only one wife and finally two sons are born to Rachel Genesis 30:22 God remembered Rachel and God hearkened to her and opened her womb and she conceived and bear a son and said God had taken away my reproach and she called his name Joseph and said the Lord shall add to me another son and she ended up having another son Rachel died tragically in child birth with Benjamin so you can see why Jacob especially after Rachel died was so partial to Joseph so we go back to the original scripture Israel loved Joseph more than all his children because he was a son of his old age and he made a coat of many colors brother Brandon said when he was born his father loved him he made him a coat of many colors now there's only seven perfect colors in in all colors all others are made off those colors and the coat PRS had colors in it of seven different colors Stripes of colors into the coat that the father made he said if you notice maybe Jacob didn't understand that at the time but that signified promised one right he didn't understand that his brother their brother may not even understood why they hated him so much and Jacob didn't understand why he was the favorite but he gave him a Cod of Many Colors which was a type of Christ who wore God's rainbow colors we find him in Revelation 43 he that set up was to look upon him like a Jasper and a sarden stone there was a rainbow round about the throne and sight like unto an emerald a rainbow brand said the reason it went round about The Throne because on Earth we only see half of it right but he said the half has never yet been told right so around the throne there's a there's a circle of a rainbow and again Revelation 10:1 he said I saw another Angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud and a rainbow was upon his head that's why we know that's not brother brandom right it's Christ and brother BR says only Christ it could be why a rainbow was upon his head and his face was as were the sun his feet as pillars of fire and so the seven colors of the rainbow red orange yellow green blue indigo and violet seven colors for the seven spirits of God I know I'm going fast here but you can go back and look all this up seven Messengers seven Church agents to bring Redemption of the Gentiles and like a great Diamond those colors reflected the character of Christ brother brand said there's your seven colored rainbow he was bruised for our iniquity what was the coat of many colors a type of what God was going to do through Jesus Christ he said he was bruised for our iniquity the chastisement of our peace was upon him and he said they bruised him and mashed him and cut him he might reflect through his dying wounds forgiveness of sin joy peace long-suffering goodness meekness gentleness the seven spirits of God he said are the seven fruits of the spirit that would reflect back in his people so what is that you're reflecting the rainbow of God every time you reflect joy and peace and Longs suffering and goodness and meekness and gentleness you're actually reflecting God so he said the seven spirits of God are the seven fruits of the spirit he said that that he was bruise shaped and form that the light of God shining through that one man's body might redeem oh my the whole world he said I'll be lifted up from the earth and I'll draw all men unto me Joseph was just the type I'm so glad for the anot type I'm so glad we have the reality in Christ that Jesus is the promised son he is God's favorite loved by his father hated by his Brethren yet bringing forgiveness and Redemption to them by his suffering at their hands oh my now we're going to turn again and this is the last time I promise I don't often preach like this I try to keep it together this brother Joel you can take this sermon do something with it but I want to change Focus again we're still talking about favoritism you know every one of your children is different I don't have to tell some of y'all that you know that some of us know that because we are different did you know Napoleon bonapart had if I'm saying that correctly had had an older brother named Joseph who stole the crown jewels of Spain and lived in New Jersey lived off the money anybody know that we don't hear much about his older brother they're different Napoleon tried to make his brother king of Spain and it didn't work he's one of the worst kings ever Napoleon one of the greatest as far as the world is concerned and his brother one of the worst Al Capone I'm not talking about Joel tonight so just actually these are older brothers so maybe it's me that's Joseph on a part you don't have to agree with that do you kids know Al Capone you know who Al Capone is you kids don't know who Al Capone is that's too old he was a he was a a gangster back in the days of the Bootleggers he sold whiskey for money when whiskey was illegal it ought to still be illegal but but that's what he did he was a bootlegger and a gangster killed a lot of people he had a brother named James who was a Prohibition agent kids are different I Isaac and Esa right R and and Jacob and and Esau rather and and Joseph and his brothers kids are different Donald Nixon ran drive-ins in California wasn't as popular as his famous Brother Richard who was president but his his tenure ended a lot better than Richards did why would we expect kids to be the same right now so so our kids are different but we love them all the same right and that doesn't mean we treat them in the same way necessarily we treat them all with the same amount of love right but we've got to deal with them I should say it that way we deal with them differently the Bible tells us because I want to make this very practical before we go tonight the Bible tells us that we should train up a child in the way he should go and when he's old he'll not depart from it in fact the Amplified version says it this way train up a child in the way he should go and in keeping with his individual gift or bent and when he's old he'll not depart from it that word way is actually the word for a a piece of wood that was curved in the right direction to make a bow out of right some wood was suitable for making a bow and some wood is not suitable for forming into a bow it still needed training it still needed shaping so he said shape them up train them up that's our job but we don't change who they are right some kids are different there are children they're not burdens though it may feel like it sometimes but they're not burdens they're are children brother Brandon says I know we all want to think our kids is Renegades and things like that but we must stop that huh I don't think we got too much problem thinking our kids are Renegades but if you do stop that said I believe that we must remember that these kids are the best kids in the world right and we should think about our kids that way even our older kids right now why are they the best kids in the world because they're our [Music] children that's not partiality you got a right to have a family do you see how it goes back to election they're the best kids in the world because they're are children are you with me now I I told you a while back I don't have the luxury of my children going out and leaving and running out and in the world and doing that I don't have that luxury they're my children you guys can look at that and say Well they're going to go this they're going to become this they're going to do that they're going to be lazy they're not never going to get a job they're going to do that you have the luxury of saying that in the current trajectory excuse me may look like that but I'll say this that that's not what's how it's going to end up I don't have the luxury of it ended up that way these are my children they're the best kids in the world cuz they're my kids are you with me now we should all look at our kids that way we should look at our kids in the church that way you kids know you're the best kids in the world right and next time you pull that quote out you guys know how to get quotes boy we're going to have a class on how to look up quotes get you an app and you can look up quotes my daughter does that to me every time we have have a disagreement she has learned that I am I am susceptible to quotes I told you that story about her and them talking too late and I got so upset and I was going to go in there and and and and set some order in the house and and uh she told me she said well Melody asked me a question about what she said tonight and I was just answering it but but brother brand you got a quote says you're the best kids in the world you ought to believe that and act like it so brother Caleb shouldn't have to yell at you to stay out of the highway right now he will if he has to right but but stay out of the highway you're the best kids in the world why would you go out there and get hit by a truck right he said because there are children we think like that and we claim them for God he said now your salvation will not save that child they got to have their own salvation right their your salvation will not save that child he said but now Paul said believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thy and thy house should be saved now what did he mean by that he didn't mean because they were saved that their house would be saved with it he meant this that because if he had enough Faith to be saved himself his same amount of faith that he had for himself would work for his children so the way that I believe for myself do I believe I can be lost no and that does not make me want to go out and sin because I believe I can't be lost I'm going to do everything I can to not be lost right and that's what a true revelation of predestination election does it doesn't make you want to go out and just live any way you want to I had somebody recently asked me and and and and not because they wanted me to but they just asked me they said why do you not preach on dress and stuff more and I thought about that and I thought you know and I told them I said the reason I don't it's because it doesn't do a lot of good to stand there and just say it all the time but if you can ever get a person to Christ then when you do say it it'll it'll mean something to them right we need to preach on dress we need to preach on brother BR say if you don't preach that you're not preaching the gospel we need to preach on those things but that's not our whole message our message is come to Calvary come to Christ get the baptism of the Holy Ghost and those things will start taking care of themselves the same faith that I have for myself I don't believe I can be lost and you have that same faith for your children I can't fathom them going out in the world and so I'm willing to do whatever it takes to keep them in the house of God knowing that if they did go I'd still believe they would be saved but but they're not going to go said man how can you say that I'm not saying that it's the same as a person you understand the same as a person that gets healed right and still blind right John Ryan the story of John Ryan he's blind walking around saying praise God for my healing I'm walking around right now saying praise God for my children who are not yet old enough to leave but believing and knowing that they won't because I have the kind of faith for them that I have for myself and those of you who have been through that maybe some of your kids did leave I'll say this they're coming back why because we we believe the same faith we had to be saved in and to and to believe that we're still saved as the same faith we have for our children very good and you say well brother Ben I don't have any kids well spend some time praying for some of these we sure need it they sure need pray for the parents sure need it B said I've got little children there's my little son Joseph Billy Sarah Rebecca well now he said I want to see each one of them a worker in the gospel doing something I want to see them saved and filled with the Holy Ghost now I've committed them to God and say I'm holding on to God for them and I believe they're going to be saved everyone one of them I believe they're going to be saved and I'll have them on the other side and I don't believe my salvation will save them no but my faith in God will do it you see my faith believing God will do it will cause them to come to Christ what are we supposed to do we're supposed to nurture our children right we're supposed to nurture them we're supposed to discipline them Paul calls it he said you fathers provoke not your children to wrath bring them up in the nurture and admonition teaching and warning right but the teaching part's got to be there and brother brandom tells us this he said the first thing I had to do do with that Divine gift that's the gift that he had of of a prophet of a sear he said was wi the hearts of the people if I haven't got their heart they wouldn't listen so I would say that about our children and and we'll be done in just a minute I'm not going to go on and on about this but we need to have the hearts of our children so we can correct our children that goes for our grandchildren goes for kids in the church goes for deacons goes for pastors right if we don't have their hearts me stand up here and yelling about how they dress is not going to help them unless they know I love them right but if they know I love them maybe I can tell them something that would help them babies need love and sometimes they need spanking but especially when they're very little they need love brother brand said listen God gave you that baby to love I don't care how bad you spoil it love it anyhow that's right love it if you don't love it now it'll grow up in a cold home and indifferent it'll seek love somewhere or something he said mother take that baby and give it fellowship and love now make it a part of you which it is and act like it hug it and kiss it and love it listen to me Church the revealing of the son of man was the opening up of all of the word to us right it wasn't just to tell us about deep things like the rainbow colors but it was to tell us about these things right he said don't be too cold with the things of the world God gave you that as a treasure raise it right they need love older kids need love too they still need nurture and there comes a time you got to be a parent you got to discipline you you spare the rod you'll spoil the child but there Comes A Time brother brandom talks about Rebecca it's important to note Rebecca's age when they talked about this because Rebecca was nearly eight 18 she was just a few days from turning 18 when this happened so she's 17 and some change I had you forgive me church I had a couple come to me one time and say we're going to set an ultimatum that at a certain time if our kid don't quit acting out and doing things they shouldn't do we're going to tell them get out of the house or get married brother brandham didn't tell us that said she needs a buddy if you can Rebecca when she started acting out in kind of a minor way but she was acting out she was going playing music that her dad didn't like amen kids not everything you hear on Christian radio or that calls itself Christian is Right some of us just rock and roll the Christian name you can't even tell what it is but in Sometimes some things daddy don't like even though it calls itself Christian but look brother brand said she needs a buddy you're the one to be her buddy said well she needs a buddy I wish somebody' be buddy to her well God give them parents for a reason said you and I we her parents these kids today needs a buddy if they had a mother and father would stay home and take care of them stood about here in a barro running around all night and things like that wouldn't have juvenile delinquency now look you said brother Ben what are you talking about well talking about favoritism look it wasn't that he treated Joseph badly but he should have treated all the children the same right but we know that was for a purpose but we should treat all our children like this you want to make it your child a favorite make them all favorites whether you got one or 15 so we got down on our knees and committed it to God and I said I know she's 18 years old we'll be in a few days and a girl that age will think about boyfriends God help us so you guys you guys have like 10 years before you start thinking about boyfriends just remember that you girl girls I said brother B talked about how he want to see her work in the office and never gets married every father's dream right I said you know dads believe in fairy tales too their daughter's not getting married I said wait a minute we've raised all we can raised her all we can now see he recognized that right because she's going to be 18 in a few days and if you keep treating her like that she's just going to leave are you with me I'm just about done he said then he said and he said he said when she does anything say Becky he said commit her to God he said we've raised her all we can Becky darling mother don't want you to do that but I'm your pal I'll stick by you let her know that you love her she's going to get somebody to love her it might be the wrong woman I said you be the woman that does the loving we got down committed it to God said we take our hands off of it that afternoon she come in she said well I guess you're still saying I ain't going over over there m said no I never said nothing about it said you know mother don't want you to do that and you know it like to killed your daddy when you heard you up there playing that Boogie Woogie music ever what it was with that girl said no he didn't want you to do that we don't want you to do that Becky but we just committed it to the Lord I want you to know that we love you whatever we you do we still love you I want my kids to know and I don't want to just say it from the pulpit I say it at home I want you to know that I love you I want you to know your kids in the church I want you to know that I love you and I'm not just being a doie old grandpa it's important cuz I'm going to have some things I got to say there's some times in the Pulpit I'm going to have to come across in a way that's very very real but know that I love you he said now he he said now he he didn't want you to do that and we we don't want you to do that but we still love you he said she huler said I'm going anyhow said all right dear so when ahead said all right I'll have supper ready when you get back she never did go no she's never went since he said not long after she met George we all know brother George George is a Christian that settled it then God has a way of taking care of our children be like Jesus not all of brother brandom's kids stayed out of the world in fact some of them you wouldn't hardly know it the way brother BR talked but he was honest with us told us a few things some of them left and did some things they shouldn't have done but they came back why because the same faith brother brandom had for himself he had for his children he said well what should I do brother Ben en closing as musicians come what should I do be like Jesus let all your kids be your favorites not just the ones that act good but the ones that don't aren't you glad aren't you glad when he was God's favorite he included you in that because we're in him when he was given the coat of many colors he included you in that and let you be a reflector what should we be church we should be reflect C of that kind of love to our families in this age of darkness in this age of coldness in this age when nobody feels love and nobody shows love let's be different than that let's love people once again sometimes that requires telling them the truth sometimes that requires telling our children the truth but let's let them know that we love them or we can't deal with them right we can't do it I pray that God blesses his word tonight I maybe you just like to think about it for a minute and just well and just bow your heads with me and say Lord I want to be a reflector of that rainbow coat of many colors in my life like Joseph was before you came I I want to be that now on the other side of that knowing what that was love joy and peace displayed through seven Church ages I want to do that in my life I want to let my kids KS know that I love them want them to know that I I believe you parents do a good job of that sometimes that requires discipline you don't just stand there and let them let them get killed in the street reason brother Caleb has to yell at y'all sometimes because he loves you and the reason sometimes we have to say the hard things from the pulpit is because we love you not because we want to hurt somebody why would we do that you people saywell you just want to get rid of people why why on Earth would I want to get rid of anybody I don't want to do that I got to speak the truth I got to tell the truth and we've got to we we we've got things that you know we we got kids in the church we got to protect them we got to build a protection around them until they're old enough be their Holy Ghost until they're old enough to get the Holy Ghost I don't want to hurt nobody but I sure want you to know that I love you and I sure want my kids to know and all of our kids to know that we love them I pray that would be the case today and if you're a person here you say well I don't have any kids or my kids are grown and gone I want you to know that you're God's child that he loves you very very much he wants to speak to you tonight how do you know that well he called you didn't he he brought you to the message must be something there that's savable must be something something there that he had in his mind before the foundation of the earth if you're one of those 100 and you've never come to Christ maybe you come to him tonight you be you you children maybe you'd be one of those 100 sheep you were always his why don't you just come to him let him speak to you Heavenly Father Lord we thank you tonight for your grace we love you we we think of all the times Lord we've let you down but you've never let us down so Lord we we embrace your forgiveness and your grace we thank you for our calling Lord and we want to work diligently to make our calling and election sure I pray that you'd help us today Lord help us to be like Jacob and do whatever it takes to get the birth right to receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost to to be sealed to the day of our Redemption I pray that it would be so in every heart Lord I pray these children children would feel the love from the church and Lord these young people would feel loved by the church not that they could do anything they wanted to but Lord that in the care that we have even if we have to remind them from time to time what's right and what's wrong may they feel that love I think Lord of many maybe grow up in imperfect homes and my heart goes out to them some without fathers without mothers Lord I I pray you'd be a father and a mother to them Lord you've been that to me I'm so thankful for that Lord oh I had a a stable home and but yet Lord You're my father and my mother my My All In All I'm so thankful For Your Love Lord I want everyone to feel what I feel I don't want anyone to be excluded want everyone to know what I know but Lord I'm so thankful that you chose me and I pray that each one of these that you've chosen Lord would just have that same feeling oh God they would know that you love them and though you let them go through some things like Jacob but you still love them I pray you'd help them today to know that it's only for their good it don't mean they're not the elect it just means that something needed to be done to cause them to come to you and sometimes the pain was there to draw Us close to you lord lord and we want to rec reverence that today and recognize it pray you grant it Lord we love you we thank you for your sweet presence that we feel here tonight I pray that you'd come and touch every heart we pray in Jesus

don't always do that but God has used I think Word of Life Church in Johnson City to to help be a place where there would be an Outreach to the community and and we we want to be the most good that we can be to all of our friends and family and so we want to support them in every way that we can especially those of like Precious faith but even everybody around us it ought to make a difference in our community that we are here just the fact that we're there wherever you work I had a pastor tell me one time he said your boss will be blessed because you worked for him and that's the truth church that's the truth he may not even know God but he'll he'll be blessed because you're there and if he can't tell that then that's a you know that's between him and God but he'll be blessed anyhow I'm so glad that we serve a god a cares cares about us we're his favorites he cares also about those that are in the world and he wants all to be saved and we believe that tonight so amen you just go reflect
