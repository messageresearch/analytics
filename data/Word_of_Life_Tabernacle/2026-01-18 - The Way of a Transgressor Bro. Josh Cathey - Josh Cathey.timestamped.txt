[5:38] Let's sing that song, Never Lose Its
[5:40] Power.
[5:48] The blood
[5:50] that Jesus
[5:53] shed
[5:55] for me.
[6:00] Oh, way back on Calary.
[6:08] It's the blood that gives me strength
[6:13] from day
[6:16] to day.
[6:18] It will never
[6:21] lose
[6:24] its power.
[6:28] For it reaches
[6:31] to the highest
[6:35] mountain you can have your seats.
[6:38] And it flows
[6:42] through the lowest
[6:45] valley.
[6:49] It's the blood
[6:52] gives me strength.
[6:54] From day
[6:57] to day,
[7:00] it will never
[7:03] lose
[7:05] it.
[7:10] It soothes
[7:12] my doubts and calms
[7:17] all my fears
[7:23] and it dries all
[7:28] my tears.
[7:30] It's the blood that gives me strength.
[7:35] From day
[7:38] to day,
[7:40] it will never
[7:43] lose
[7:45] its power. Raise your hands and sing it.
[7:50] for it reaches
[7:53] to the highest
[7:56] mountain
[8:00] and it flows
[8:03] to the Lord
[8:06] with the valley.
[8:11] It's the blood
[8:13] that gives me strength
[8:16] from day
[8:19] to day.
[8:21] It will never
[8:24] lose
[8:26] its power. Sing that chorus again. A
[8:28] sister only comes before it reaches
[8:33] to the highest
[8:37] mountain.
[8:40] And it flows
[8:44] to
[8:46] this valley
[8:49] for me.
[8:51] It's the blood that gives me strength.
[8:56] From day
[8:58] to day,
[9:01] it will never
[9:04] lose
[9:06] its power. Do you believe it tonight?
[9:09] Give him a hand clap of praise.
[9:49] Okay.
[10:02] Overcomer.
[10:05] I'm an overcomer.
[10:09] By the blood of the lamb
[10:13] and by the word of my testimony.
[10:18] Overcomer.
[10:22] I'm an overcomer.
[10:26] By the blood of the lamb
[10:30] and by the word of my testimony.
[10:36] He saved me.
[10:40] He rescued me.
[10:45] He delivered me.
[10:49] And he set me free.
[10:53] And ever since I've been changed,
[10:57] I've never been the same.
[11:01] And I can lift my hands and say,
[11:05] "Thank you for your grace."
[11:12] I'm an overcomer
[11:16] by the blood of the lamb
[11:20] and by the word of my testimony
[11:26] overcomer.
[11:29] I'm an overcomer
[11:33] by the blood of the lamb
[11:37] and by the word of my testimony.

[11:49] rescued me.
[11:51] &gt;&gt; Testimony
[11:53] delivered me. is a word and must set me
[11:58] free.
[12:00] &gt;&gt; Testimony.
[12:01] &gt;&gt; Ever since I've been changed,
[12:03] &gt;&gt; I have a testimony.
[12:05] &gt;&gt; I've never been the same.
[12:09] &gt;&gt; I can't lift my hands and say
[12:13] thank you for your grace.
[12:20] I've been overcome
[12:24] by the blood of the lamb.
[12:28] And by the word of my testimony,
[12:33] overcomer.
[12:35] More than a conqueror, I'm a winner. The
[12:39] joy of the Lord is my strength. I have
[12:43] dominion.
[12:45] And I walk in authority.
[12:48] And I've been washed in the blood. I'm
[12:52] kept by his love. Filled with his
[12:55] spirit. By his stripes I'm healed and
[13:00] I'm free.
[13:02] Yes, Jesus gave me the victory.
[13:06] Overcomer.
[13:08] More than a conqueror. I'm a winner. The
[13:12] joy of the Lord is my strength. I have
[13:16] dominion.
[13:18] I walk in authority.
[13:21] And I've been washed in the blood. I'm
[13:25] kept by his love. Filled with his spirit
[13:29] by his stripes. I'm healed and I'm free.
[13:35] Yes. Jesus gave me the victory.
[13:39] Overcomer.
[13:43] I'm an overcomer
[13:47] by the blood of the lamb
[13:51] and by the word of my testimony
[13:56] overcomer.
[13:59] I'm an overcomer
[14:04] by the blood of the lamb
[14:08] and by the word of my testimony.
[14:14] My testimony.
[14:19] My testimony.
[14:23] My testimony
[14:25] is the word of my testimony.
[14:40] We're going to go ahead and have uh
[14:42] Jason and Elijah come up to sing.
[15:15] Homeless world. I want to see
[15:20] things down here ain't got no chains on
[15:24] me.
[15:26] But I'm not worried about the future
[15:28] because I know
[15:31] he's ready to come
[15:34] and I'm ready to go.
[15:37] Well, it seems like everybody's talking
[15:41] about heaven.
[15:44] And if you want to go along, you better
[15:47] be believing.
[15:50] I've got a feeling someday soon we'll be
[15:53] leaving.
[15:56] And if you want to ride this train, you
[15:58] better not be slow.
[16:01] You ready to come?
[16:04] Are you ready to go?
[16:07] He's ready to come.
[16:10] Are you ready to go?
[16:14] Sometimes it seems that everything goes
[16:17] wrong.
[16:20] I just sit around and cry and sing old
[16:23] sad songs.
[16:26] But then he whispers in my ear and he
[16:28] lets me know
[16:31] he's ready to come
[16:34] and I'm ready to go.
[16:37] Well, it seems like everybody's talking
[16:40] about heaven.
[16:43] And if you want to go along, you better
[16:46] be believing.
[16:49] I've got a feeling someday soon we'll be
[16:52] leaving.
[16:55] And if you want to ride this train, you
[16:57] better not be slow.
[17:00] He's ready to come.
[17:03] Are you ready to go?
[17:06] He's ready to come.
[17:09] Are you ready to go?
[17:11] He's ready to come
[17:14] and I'm ready to go.
[17:25] Um, Sister McCen, if you would just go
[17:28] ahead and come up to sing and then uh
[17:30] after that we'll invite our pastor to
[17:32] come.
[18:05] Where would I be.
[18:08] You only know.
[18:13] I'm glad you see Lord
[18:16] through us alone.
[18:20] A hopeless case,
[18:24] an empty place.
[18:28] If not for grace,
[18:32] where would I be?
[18:36] You will know.
[18:40] I'm glad you see love through eyes of
[18:45] love.
[18:48] I'm a hopeless case
[18:52] and empty place.
[18:55] Thank God for grace.
[19:00] Oh precious Lord,
[19:04] take my hand.
[19:07] Oh, lead me on
[19:11] and let me stand.
[19:15] I'm a hopeless
[19:17] place,
[19:19] an empty place.
[19:23] Thank God for grace.
[19:28] Amazing
[19:30] grace.
[19:32] How sweet
[19:34] the sound
[19:36] that saved
[19:38] a rich
[19:40] like me.
[19:43] I once
[19:45] was lost
[19:47] but now
[19:49] I'm found.
[19:51] was blind, but now
[19:55] I see.
[19:58] My chains are gone.
[20:02] I've been set free.
[20:06] My God, my Savior
[20:10] has ransomed me free.
[20:14] And like a flood,
[20:18] his mercy reigns.
[20:22] Unending love.
[20:25] It's amazing grace.
[20:30] Where would I be?
[20:33] You only know.
[20:37] I'm glad you see me
[20:41] through eyes of love.
[20:45] I'm a hopeless place
[20:49] and empty place
[20:53] if not for grace.
[20:57] I'm a hopeless case
[21:01] and empty place.
[21:05] Thank God for grace.
[21:20] Thank you, Lord.
[21:22] &gt;&gt; Let's sing that again as we invite our
[21:23] pastor to come. Where would I be?
[21:29] &gt;&gt; You only know.
[21:33] I'm glad you see
[21:37] through eyes of love.
[21:49] If not for grace singing now, where
[21:53] would I be? Oh yes, you only know.
[22:01] Oh, you only see
[22:05] through eyes of love.
[22:09] I was a hopeless case,
[22:13] an empty place,
[22:17] if not grace.
[22:20] Aren't you glad for grace tonight?
[22:23] Amazing grace, how sweet the sound.
[22:28] When you find, if you make it over
[22:29] there, I believe that you will. You find
[22:31] me find me singing, "Amazing grace, how
[22:34] sweet the sound." What brother Brandham
[22:35] said, "Amazing grace." How sweet the
[22:38] sound. Paul says, "By the grace of God,
[22:41] I am what I am." Aren't you glad for his
[22:44] grace today? You're glad for his mercy.
[22:47] Amen. My goodness. I believe his spirit
[22:51] is here tonight. And I'm going to
[22:52] introduce brother Josh Kathy. Brother
[22:54] Josh just moved here and part of the
[22:57] church here with us now, part of our
[22:59] ministry team. And I just I just
[23:02] appreciate them having the confidence to
[23:04] come and I believe it's going they're
[23:06] going to be a big part of what we do
[23:07] here at the church. But brother Josh has
[23:09] got an amazing testimony. I believe he's
[23:11] going to share some of that with us
[23:12] today. And and um you know God has a way
[23:17] of getting you. He's got a way of doing
[23:19] what he does. And I I believe that I
[23:23] believe that there's hope for everyone.
[23:25] And we should just love him for that and
[23:29] thank him for what he's done for us. As
[23:30] brother Josh comes, let's just sing it
[23:32] one more time. Oh, I I was a hopeless
[23:35] case, church. An empty place without
[23:38] form and void, but God rich in mercy.
[23:42] Hallelujah. He found me. Aren't you glad
[23:45] for that? As brother Josh comes, you
[23:48] only know
[23:50] I'm glad you see
[23:54] through eyes of blood.
[23:58] I was a hopeless case. Thank you, Lord.
[24:02] An empty place
[24:06] if not for grace. Amazing grace. Amazing
[24:12] grace.
[24:14] How sweet the sound of glory.
[24:22] Oh, but now I found
[24:26] I was a whole space
[24:30] and empty.
[24:34] If not for grace, where would I be? You
[24:37] only know where would I be.
[24:41] Oh yeah.
[24:43] Heat. Heat.
[25:08] God bless you.
[25:17] Getting the house set up or should I say
[25:19] cadence mostly because when I put
[25:21] something somewhere else.
[25:24] It's kind of like a mule. I'm just
[25:26] hauling it in and let it let it be put
[25:28] where it needs to go.
[25:30] But brother Benny had asked me to speak
[25:32] this evening and um I'd preach here a
[25:36] few other times, maybe a handful of
[25:38] times, but thought it would just be a
[25:39] good opportunity to share my testimony.
[25:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[25:42] &gt;&gt; To share how that how the light got lit.
[25:45] Brother Brandham said, "If you can't do
[25:46] anything else, just tell somebody how
[25:48] your light got lit."
[25:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right. And so I believe I
[25:51] believe that and I believe this message
[25:54] with all my heart. I believe this Bible
[25:55] with all my heart and I it's my
[25:57] absolute.
[25:59] &gt;&gt; And let's if we could let's turn to um
[26:02] Proverbs
[26:05] 13:15.
[26:10] And I didn't um I didn't grow up a
[26:13] Christian. I grew up in this area as
[26:15] many of you might know. Um, but I didn't
[26:18] quite grow up a Christian going to
[26:20] church, anything like that. Didn't
[26:21] didn't know much about the message. Um,
[26:24] so I have kind of a history in this area
[26:26] that I'm not exactly proud of, but I
[26:30] believe it's a part of our testimonies.
[26:31] I believe those those things are, you
[26:33] know, they're not ordained of God to
[26:35] happen in our lives and we get that
[26:36] permissive will sometimes, but I believe
[26:39] it can all be put together in our
[26:41] testimonies as a as an evidence as a as
[26:44] something that we can be not well not
[26:46] proud of, but we can say this is where
[26:49] God came in my life and this is who I
[26:51] was and this is who I am now.
[26:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:54] And Proverbs
[26:57] 13:15, it says, "Good understanding
[27:00] giveth favor, but the way of
[27:03] transgressors is hard."
[27:05] &gt;&gt; And that'd be the title tonight, the way
[27:07] of a transgressor, which this will be my
[27:09] testimony, but I thought that was a I
[27:11] thought about that scripture and how
[27:13] Brother Brandham had mentioned it many
[27:14] times and it felt like it just fit my
[27:16] life. Um, we could just bow our heads
[27:19] for a moment. Heavenly Father, Lord, we
[27:23] just thank you for another opportunity
[27:24] to come into your house, Lord, to
[27:26] worship your name. And Lord, we just ask
[27:29] that you would be with us in this
[27:30] service, Lord. That you would anoint
[27:32] ears to hear, Lord. That we could just
[27:33] be a help to somebody, Father. That's
[27:35] all we want to be. It's not we're not
[27:37] standing up here for a show. We're not
[27:39] here to here to please anybody else but
[27:42] you, Father. We just want to help one
[27:44] another. And Lord, I believe a testimony
[27:46] that can happen. I believe when you hear
[27:49] what someone's been through, maybe
[27:50] somebody else is going through it,
[27:52] Father, and you know these things. We
[27:54] don't know everything, but we just ask
[27:55] that you would take full control of the
[27:57] service and that you would just have
[27:59] your way in it. In Jesus Christ's name
[28:01] we ask. Amen. Amen. You may be seated.
[28:06] This Proverbs and I'm just going to try
[28:08] and talk as I didn't really want to try
[28:10] and preach a sermon tonight. Um, I just
[28:13] wanted to talk as open and as candid as
[28:15] I could about my testimony. I didn't
[28:18] want to get up here and preach to
[28:19] everybody. And, you know, not exactly,
[28:23] but I just wanted to be open about my
[28:25] life. And if I'm going to be a part of
[28:26] you here and I came up here and I have a
[28:29] history here, I would want the church,
[28:31] if I'm going to be a minister in this
[28:32] church, to know about that firsthand.
[28:34] not not hear it from anybody else, not
[28:36] hear it from because I have to say the
[28:38] other night, brother Ben and brother
[28:41] Joel, they had came over to my house
[28:43] that we moved into and um we were
[28:46] sitting there fellowship in in the
[28:47] living room and and they were they were
[28:49] kind of poking fun at me, but they were
[28:51] saying, "We've heard a few things about
[28:52] you in this area. We we've heard a few
[28:54] things." And I said, "Well, what did you
[28:55] hear?" And I I don't really want to
[28:57] share exactly what they heard, matter of
[28:59] fact, but it it um it made me it made me
[29:04] real I had never realized how um ashamed
[29:09] I was of who I had been.
[29:11] &gt;&gt; Okay. But I never realized how ashamed I
[29:15] was of who I had been. And when when
[29:18] they told me that that night, I had
[29:19] trouble sleeping. I couldn't go to
[29:21] sleep. I thought about it all night. And
[29:23] I was thinking, there just two people in
[29:24] the church. There's a whole church of
[29:26] people here that can talk to anybody and
[29:28] everybody they want to. And so it it
[29:31] just kind of um I was ashamed about it.
[29:34] But the Lord, he as I prayed, he laid
[29:38] some scriptures on my heart and some
[29:40] some thoughts in the scripture and he he
[29:43] kind of comforted me. He let me know
[29:44] that it wasn't for it wasn't without a
[29:46] purpose because that's exactly as
[29:48] brother Ben preached this morning. And
[29:50] if I get emotional talking about it,
[29:52] &gt;&gt; I apologize. But
[29:57] &gt;&gt; good.
[29:58] &gt;&gt; But when he preached this morning, the
[30:00] earth was without form and void. And I
[30:03] would say that's exactly who I was.
[30:07] &gt;&gt; I didn't know my maker. I didn't know
[30:10] I didn't know who I was,
[30:12] &gt;&gt; plainly put. And the enemy, he wants to
[30:14] keep you on that ground. He wants to
[30:16] keep you not knowing who you are. He
[30:18] wants to keep you as far away from Jesus
[30:21] Christ as he can keep you. He doesn't
[30:23] want you to know
[30:24] &gt;&gt; what what's out there per se.
[30:27] &gt;&gt; And something that uh something that had
[30:29] came to my mind, the scripture, the the
[30:31] first one that had came to mind when I
[30:32] was thinking about giving my testimony
[30:35] was was actually just a few Bible
[30:36] characters or or people in the
[30:38] scripture. It was Mori and Hmon.
[30:40] &gt;&gt; And how and how Hmon when Mordei
[30:42] wouldn't bow to him, how how he was just
[30:45] after Mori all the time. He he just
[30:47] wanted what was the scripture doesn't
[30:49] I'm sure tell us that whole story. I'm
[30:51] sure the dayto-day living for Mori was
[30:53] not comfortable
[30:54] &gt;&gt; because he he refused to bow but at that
[30:57] at the and God has a way of doing
[30:59] things.
[31:00] &gt;&gt; He has a way of when the enemy's had his
[31:02] hand on you for so long he has a way of
[31:04] turning it back around on him. Amen.
[31:07] &gt;&gt; And so we get to a point in that story
[31:08] to where Hmon has to be the one I
[31:11] believe it goes that he had to he had to
[31:13] dress Mori
[31:14] &gt;&gt; and he had to will him around through
[31:16] the city. And then you get later on in
[31:17] the story and this would be my testimony
[31:20] right here. You get later on in that
[31:22] story and the the thing that happened
[31:24] was that Hmon had these gallows built
[31:27] &gt;&gt; and his his main thing that he wanted
[31:29] for these gallows right here
[31:31] &gt;&gt; was to hang Morai on them. Yeah.
[31:34] &gt;&gt; And then at the end of that story, he
[31:36] flips the script. And God has a way of
[31:38] coming into our lives, coming on the
[31:40] scene, and flipping the script in our
[31:42] life.
[31:44] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[31:46] &gt;&gt; And what he did there
[31:48] was Hmon ended up hanging on the exact
[31:51] gallows that he had built to kill Morai.
[31:55] &gt;&gt; And that's exactly what a testimony is.
[31:57] &gt;&gt; Come on. That's right.
[31:58] &gt;&gt; It's you getting up and telling about
[32:01] those gallows that that had your name on
[32:03] them
[32:04] &gt;&gt; that were meant for you,
[32:06] &gt;&gt; but now
[32:08] &gt;&gt; they're meant for the enemy.
[32:11] &gt;&gt; That's what a testimony is.
[32:14] &gt;&gt; That's good.
[32:15] &gt;&gt; And I apologize for getting emotional.
[32:17] It's
[32:19] &gt;&gt; But I believe God respects that. You
[32:22] know, it shows
[32:23] &gt;&gt; when you get it's not there's nothing
[32:25] wrong with crying about your testimony
[32:27] or crying about what he's done for you.
[32:29] &gt;&gt; It's showing how important it was to
[32:30] you.
[32:31] &gt;&gt; And and that's exactly we we talk about
[32:33] revival a lot in the church. If we want
[32:35] revival, then get alone between you and
[32:38] God and think back to what he did for
[32:40] you.
[32:41] &gt;&gt; Let your mind really go back to
[32:42] everything he's done for you.
[32:44] &gt;&gt; We We talk about power and knowing who
[32:46] we are and all these things. That's all
[32:48] great and I believe it and I believe
[32:49] that was preached.
[32:50] &gt;&gt; Come on. But get alone with God
[32:52] sometimes and think exactly what all
[32:54] you've been through
[32:57] &gt;&gt; cuz the enemy, you know, the me our
[32:58] memory will betray us so much of the
[33:00] time. That channel of memory, it'll
[33:02] betray you. It'll bring these things
[33:04] from the past rushing in. You did this,
[33:06] you did that, and he'll try and bury you
[33:07] under a pile of guilt
[33:09] &gt;&gt; is exactly what he'll do.
[33:12] &gt;&gt; But that channel of memory can also
[33:14] bring to to remembrance all that God has
[33:16] brought you through.
[33:18] I may have been this before, but I'm
[33:20] this now.
[33:22] &gt;&gt; I'm not that anymore.
[33:24] &gt;&gt; I'm not him anymore.
[33:26] &gt;&gt; Because the prophet tells us that's
[33:28] exactly what the enemy wants to do. He
[33:29] wants to get you to doubt your position.
[33:31] And to get you to doubt your position,
[33:33] he's going to bring anything and
[33:35] everything he can against you.
[33:37] &gt;&gt; Like a court case.
[33:38] &gt;&gt; He's going to pull up all this so-called
[33:40] evidence that he has that I guess he I
[33:42] think he does realize it's under the
[33:44] blood, but he's still going to bring it
[33:46] up. He's going to try and bring it
[33:48] before the believer
[33:49] &gt;&gt; and say, "There's no way this person
[33:52] right here,
[33:53] &gt;&gt; cuz you know who you was. There's no way
[33:55] this person right here was redeemable.
[33:57] &gt;&gt; Think about this. Think about when you
[33:59] did this, you did this. Do you think the
[34:01] other people sitting in the church have
[34:03] done that?
[34:04] &gt;&gt; Oh my."
[34:04] &gt;&gt; He'll ask you questions like that.
[34:07] &gt;&gt; Do you think they've ever struggled with
[34:08] that? Brother so and so, they've lived
[34:10] it their whole life.
[34:11] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[34:11] &gt;&gt; They've never had a slip up. But see,
[34:13] that's that's that's presuming. That's
[34:15] venturing without authority.
[34:17] &gt;&gt; We don't know anybody else's life. We've
[34:19] all been through stuff. We all have a
[34:22] testimony. We all have a journey.
[34:25] &gt;&gt; And it's not always the proudest thing.
[34:30] &gt;&gt; The definition of testimony in itself.
[34:31] And I may not very I may not go very
[34:33] long tonight. It's a testimony. I may
[34:36] Brother Ben told me I could go four
[34:37] hours if I wanted. So I might do that or
[34:39] I might go 30 minutes. I don't know. But
[34:42] he preached so long this morning. I
[34:43] don't know how long I should keep y'all.
[34:46] No, I'm just I'm just messing with it.
[34:49] But the definition of testimony,
[34:50] according to Webster, is a firsthand
[34:53] authentification of a fact
[34:56] &gt;&gt; or or in better terms, an evidence.
[34:59] &gt;&gt; And that's exactly what my testimony is
[35:01] to me. It's an evidence.
[35:03] &gt;&gt; It's an evidence that something
[35:05] happened. It's an evidence of that God
[35:07] works today. It's an evidence that the
[35:09] that the blood still works,
[35:12] &gt;&gt; that you can still claim the blood of
[35:14] Jesus Christ and you can be saved from
[35:16] sin.
[35:17] &gt;&gt; That's what my testimony is. And your
[35:20] testimony, it never stops.
[35:22] &gt;&gt; It wasn't just from the point when when
[35:24] you didn't know the Lord till when you
[35:25] knew him. But I'd like to think that my
[35:27] testimony goes on every single day I
[35:30] live. Every step I take, I wanted to add
[35:33] to that testimony.
[35:36] I don't just want to say the Lord saved
[35:37] me and I haven't felt his presence
[35:39] again.
[35:40] &gt;&gt; No,
[35:41] &gt;&gt; I want to say he's walked with me every
[35:43] day since that day and he's never left
[35:46] me and he's never forsook me. He's never
[35:48] let the enemy have me.
[35:50] &gt;&gt; But he's walked with me.
[35:53] &gt;&gt; He's held me when I couldn't stand up.
[35:56] &gt;&gt; He's the footprints in the sand.
[35:59] &gt;&gt; When I couldn't walk, he walked for me.
[36:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[36:04] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. But these testimonies,
[36:06] they're very I I believe we should have
[36:07] more testimony services.
[36:09] &gt;&gt; I believe they're important. I believe
[36:11] they're encouraging. The prophet said,
[36:13] &gt;&gt; he he was speaking in the message here,
[36:15] the world has fallen apart and it the
[36:18] world has fallen apart. I think a week
[36:20] before that there had been a lot of
[36:22] testimony services and he had went to
[36:24] them and he had listened to these men uh
[36:26] tell their testimonies and this is what
[36:28] he had to say about he said certainly a
[36:29] grand privilege to be here to be hearing
[36:31] these fine testimonies from these
[36:33] brothers that's in love with our lord
[36:35] Jesus he said now I still live on the he
[36:38] said what would I say the inspiration I
[36:40] received from their messages
[36:42] &gt;&gt; he received the the prophet of God
[36:44] received inspiration from these men's
[36:47] testimonies
[36:48] &gt;&gt; you think just a testimony. It wasn't
[36:50] some deep theological sermon. It It
[36:53] wasn't something groundbreaking. It
[36:54] wasn't something on the seals, something
[36:56] on the on whatever it may be.
[36:59] &gt;&gt; No, but he received inspiration. What he
[37:01] received inspiration from was sincere
[37:04] hearts crying out, was sincere hearts
[37:06] telling a story about what they had been
[37:08] through.
[37:09] &gt;&gt; That's what he was receiving inspiration
[37:11] from. And that that's what God looks for
[37:14] so much of the time is a sincere heart
[37:16] that he can work with. that that's the
[37:19] point I believe that I had to get to.
[37:22] &gt;&gt; And my testimony is when when I had I I
[37:24] grew up not going to a whole lot of
[37:26] church. I didn't I'd maybe been to
[37:27] church 10 times in my whole life, I
[37:29] would say, if I was guessing up to the
[37:31] point where I when I heard the message
[37:34] or came back to church. And as I was
[37:37] growing up, I I drank, I smoked, I I did
[37:41] everything somebody could do. I did too
[37:43] much. I did things that I wasn't big
[37:44] enough to be doing. And so, as a story
[37:47] goes, um, as time goes on, I end up
[37:52] going to college and I and I play
[37:54] baseball in college. And while I'm
[37:56] playing baseball in college, I have an
[37:58] invitation to go to Wyoming and continue
[38:00] playing. And I go up to Wyoming and I
[38:02] get in a collegiate baseball league
[38:04] there. And as I'm playing, you know, I'm
[38:06] I I had told this at the church in
[38:08] Arizona before I left. I had talked
[38:10] about the power of transformation. And
[38:12] brother Benny, I think he had read some
[38:13] quotes from it this morning, but I told
[38:15] them, I am a believer in the power of
[38:18] transformation. If there's anybody that
[38:20] tells me that God still can't transform,
[38:22] I would have a problem with that because
[38:24] I believe I'm a I'm a standing testimony
[38:26] of that, that God still has that power
[38:29] to transform somebody in their lives.
[38:32] &gt;&gt; And when he was he God started working
[38:34] on me when I was up there, and what I I
[38:37] believe it was is he was done chasing
[38:39] me. I I had shared with somebody the
[38:41] other day my whole life everywhere I had
[38:44] went and I had worked I was surrounded
[38:46] by the message somehow. I had worked for
[38:49] brother Paul Brewer and there and I had
[38:52] my my grandma my whole life growing up
[38:54] she had the pillar of fire picture in
[38:56] her home and I never asked any questions
[38:58] and I just what I thought that was when
[39:00] I because I knew brother Paul was a a
[39:02] good man. I realized that about him.
[39:05] &gt;&gt; And I I went in his home one time and I
[39:07] saw the same Pillar of Fire picture
[39:08] there that was in my grandma's house.
[39:10] And I remember thinking, well, this must
[39:12] just be what all church folks have. They
[39:14] must all have that picture. I didn't
[39:16] know anything about Baptist or
[39:17] Methodists or Presbyterian or Catholics
[39:19] or anything like that. When I saw the
[39:21] picture, in my mind, it just represented
[39:24] somebody that was a pretty good person
[39:25] that they went to church regular. That's
[39:27] what I thought it was in my mind at that
[39:29] point. But so I was in this collegiate
[39:32] league in Wyoming and and God, I
[39:34] believe, had got to a point where he was
[39:36] done chasing. And it it'll get to that
[39:39] point sometimes. Sometimes you'll only
[39:40] be left with two doors in your life that
[39:42] you can walk through that you can accept
[39:44] it or you can deny it. And he had got
[39:46] tired of chasing me. And I had got to a
[39:49] point in in um in Wyoming there that
[39:52] that I I kind of just had a come aart, I
[39:55] would call it. My my mind I I borderline
[39:58] thought I was going crazy, you know. I I
[40:00] lost I lost my mind is what I would say.
[40:02] I remember being at a and I I'll I'm
[40:04] going to if we got time I'm going to get
[40:06] open and
[40:08] &gt;&gt; get vulnerable with you for a minute.
[40:10] But I remember being at a gas station
[40:12] and we were pulled in the gas station
[40:14] and all we were all in a single cab
[40:16] truck about four of us sitting in there
[40:18] and I was driving and they ran in and I
[40:19] asked them to get me a pack of
[40:20] cigarettes. Said, "Hey, will you guys
[40:22] get me some cigarettes out of there?"
[40:24] And I I was sitting in that truck and
[40:26] right when I said that a a physical
[40:29] feeling came over me of fear and dread
[40:31] and anxiety and and it rushed through my
[40:34] body and I didn't know what it was. So I
[40:35] opened the truck door and I got out of
[40:37] the truck and I was standing there for a
[40:38] minute and I had no idea what was
[40:40] happening to me
[40:41] &gt;&gt; and I I I lost u I don't know how to put
[40:46] it. I lost like consciousness of myself
[40:49] and the next thing I know I'm standing
[40:51] in a road. I'm standing out in the
[40:53] middle of a road. There's cars moving.
[40:55] There's cars going. And I find myself
[40:57] standing right there in that road. And I
[41:00] remember I went back to the truck and I
[41:02] called my mom right away. And I didn't
[41:05] know what was going on. And I tried to
[41:06] describe it, what I was feeling, and I I
[41:08] did the best I could to talk about it.
[41:10] And I I didn't know what it was. And at
[41:13] that we we were staying with I was
[41:15] staying at the coach's home of the team
[41:18] and we had went back to the house and I
[41:20] tried to sleep that night. didn't sleep
[41:21] at all that night and this this anxiety
[41:24] and this dread was just hanging over the
[41:26] top of me and I I kept calling my mom
[41:30] and this was 15 hours from Dyresburg,
[41:32] Tennessee where they were living at or
[41:33] still living right now. And we just
[41:37] decided the best thing to happen was
[41:38] that I would come home or I would I
[41:40] would try and make it to Dyresburg. And
[41:42] that's a 15-hour drive. And so I start
[41:44] feeling this way and I I can't describe
[41:46] the feeling to you. If anybody's ever
[41:48] felt anxiety, anxiety is fear driven.
[41:51] And what anxiety is is you're you're
[41:53] scared of something that you don't even
[41:55] know what you're scared of. It's it's
[41:57] irrelevant. It's it's it doesn't make
[41:59] any sense type of fear.
[42:01] &gt;&gt; It's just a a dread and a nervousness
[42:04] that comes over you for no
[42:09] anxiety. And I've been told by uh older
[42:12] folks that that used to not you didn't
[42:14] hear anxiety, all this problems with
[42:16] anxiety and things like that. But what
[42:17] anxiety is to me is a is a scare tactic
[42:21] of the enemy. It's something that he
[42:23] places on somebody.
[42:25] &gt;&gt; But I believe I had gotten to a point
[42:26] where the Lord took a step back and took
[42:28] his hand. I believe he kept me and
[42:30] protected me
[42:32] &gt;&gt; before I ever accepted him.
[42:34] &gt;&gt; I believe he kept his eye on me because
[42:37] he knew where he's the alpha and the
[42:38] omega. He knew where I was going to end
[42:40] up at
[42:41] &gt;&gt; and I believe he kept me. I remember
[42:43] times when my friends would be doing
[42:44] things that I thought was a little bit
[42:46] too far and he would keep me in certain
[42:48] moments like that. There's times where I
[42:50] believe that I was supposed to be dead.
[42:53] I have flipp here the I don't know what
[42:55] the road's called but the the road on
[42:57] Pocahontas in between where Pocahontas
[42:59] is and when you get off um the road
[43:01] taking you to Jonesboro in between there
[43:03] I rolled a truck a truck with 37in tires
[43:06] big tall truck and I rolled it and I
[43:08] there was a covert like this in the road
[43:09] one of them that did a lot of water
[43:10] rushes through and I hit that with my
[43:13] truck and went over it and landed on the
[43:15] other side. You can't explain things
[43:17] like that. You can't explain why you
[43:20] were kept.
[43:21] &gt;&gt; But he kept you. He He kept us when we
[43:24] were unredeemable. It seemed when we
[43:26] were Don't Don't Don't Don't be confused
[43:29] when these trials and things happen to
[43:30] you. But all that means is that he's got
[43:32] confidence in you that you can make it
[43:34] through it because he had to ordain it
[43:36] in the first place.
[43:37] &gt;&gt; He had to give permission. Yes, this can
[43:40] happen because he believes in you.
[43:42] &gt;&gt; He if you're if you're his bride, he
[43:44] believes in his bride. I trust my wife.
[43:48] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[43:48] &gt;&gt; I trust her fully for anything. And
[43:51] that's the exact relationship right
[43:53] there. Thank you, Lord.
[43:55] &gt;&gt; He trusts us. And so I get back home and
[43:58] it it it doesn't seemingly get any
[44:00] better. And I would say two weeks go by
[44:02] and after the two weeks that went by, uh
[44:04] this was this was nights of I was a
[44:07] 22year-old grown man at this point. And
[44:10] I I was sleeping in the bed next to my
[44:13] mom.
[44:15] &gt;&gt; You can laugh if you want. It wasn't
[44:18] funny then, but I was a grown man
[44:20] sleeping with my mom because I couldn't
[44:23] I couldn't stand to be alone. I would
[44:25] wake up screaming at night and tell her
[44:27] to pray out loud for me.
[44:32] &gt;&gt; And she'd put her hand over on me and
[44:33] pray out loud.
[44:36] &gt;&gt; And those things got me through.
[44:39] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[44:41] &gt;&gt; Cuz that God was coming back on the
[44:42] scene.
[44:44] &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. But after a couple weeks of
[44:46] that, nothing
[44:48] getting no better.
[44:50] I um
[44:52] my grandma at the time, she knew brother
[44:55] George Moore. He had a church in Troy,
[44:57] Tennessee. And I had just went to my
[45:00] grandma and I said, "I want to be
[45:01] baptized." Cuz I didn't I still didn't
[45:04] know anything. Still hadn't read my
[45:05] Bible. Still hadn't nothing. Um I just
[45:08] knew that I had felt a God that was real
[45:10] up to that point. Yes.
[45:12] &gt;&gt; And uh so I tell my grandma I want to be
[45:15] baptized and in my head when I got
[45:16] baptized when they were going to take me
[45:18] and they were going to dunk me under
[45:19] that water and bring me back up. What
[45:21] was going to happen is it was going to
[45:22] wash away all my troubles
[45:24] &gt;&gt; and that I could go back to living the
[45:25] life that I really wanted to live.
[45:27] &gt;&gt; I didn't want to live this way. I I
[45:29] wanted to go back to doing what I was
[45:30] doing before.
[45:31] &gt;&gt; Yeah. I shared with the church here in
[45:33] Phoenix that uh or in Dwey, Arizona that
[45:36] a month before I met Kaden and brother
[45:39] George and sister Brandy and all them a
[45:41] month before that I was I was in a bar,
[45:43] a dive bar with a picture of beer in
[45:45] front of me with a cigarette in between
[45:46] my fingers. And so that's what I mean. I
[45:49] I know there's a God of transformation.
[45:51] I know there's a God that can take that
[45:53] can take a piece of clay that's without
[45:55] form and without void and that he can
[45:58] make something of it. He can give it
[46:00] direction. He can give it purpose.
[46:03] &gt;&gt; He can start pressing on it in certain
[46:05] ways and get it to mold into what it
[46:07] needs to be.
[46:08] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[46:09] &gt;&gt; So, I know if somebody comes up to me
[46:10] and tells me that God doesn't work in
[46:12] that way anymore, I know that's not
[46:14] true.
[46:15] &gt;&gt; If the enemy tells me that, I know
[46:17] that's a lie
[46:18] &gt;&gt; because I'm a I I've experienced it.
[46:21] &gt;&gt; I've had an experience of it.
[46:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. And so I go and I I I go to
[46:26] brother George's church there and I walk
[46:29] in Sunday in a t-shirt and some jeans
[46:31] and he calls me back to his office and
[46:34] he calls me back to his office and I sit
[46:36] in his office with him and he says, "So
[46:39] uh how do you put it?" He he might have
[46:41] said, "So how do you know about the
[46:42] message? How what do you know about the
[46:44] message? How'd you hear about it?"
[46:45] They're just asking me questions about
[46:47] the Bible, too. And and I said, "Oh, I
[46:49] know the message.
[46:50] I know. I know." Because I'm thinking,
[46:52] man, if I can just get out in front of
[46:54] this guy, he can baptize me. I can go
[46:55] back to doing what I was doing. You
[46:56] know, I can get back to living the life
[46:58] I want to live. And I'm being open with
[47:00] you. These are the thoughts I had.
[47:02] &gt;&gt; And so he talks to me a little bit
[47:05] longer. And why he agreed to baptize me,
[47:07] I'll never know. But I I go back out and
[47:10] I sit he preaches and I sit through the
[47:11] service. And after the service, well,
[47:14] actually, I left out a little a detail
[47:16] in there. Um, as I go out of his office
[47:19] and I'm sitting in the back, I see a
[47:22] girl playing the violin up on the front
[47:26] and I'm looking at her and I'm thinking,
[47:28] "Man, she's pretty." And turns out that
[47:31] was my wife.
[47:34] And so this random church that I had
[47:36] just walked into, didn't know anywhere.
[47:38] I I had asked my grandma to contact
[47:41] somebody to baptize me. Didn't know what
[47:43] that meant. Um, I look up there and I
[47:47] had the I I'll say this. I I had never I
[47:50] had never and this is shameful. I had
[47:54] not looked up till that point in my
[47:56] life. I had not looked at women in a in
[47:59] a in a way that's
[48:02] I I don't know how to put that. I had
[48:03] not looked at women in a good way.
[48:06] &gt;&gt; You know, if if you catch what I'm
[48:07] saying, we're in a church setting. I
[48:08] don't want to.
[48:10] &gt;&gt; Um, but I looked at her and there was
[48:12] something about her and she she never
[48:14] liked it when I when I used to tell her
[48:16] that. She'd say, "You think I was
[48:17] pretty?" And I said, "No, it wasn't
[48:19] that, but there was something different
[48:20] about you.
[48:21] &gt;&gt; There was something when I looked at
[48:22] you, I saw something different."
[48:25] &gt;&gt; And and
[48:26] &gt;&gt; I don't know if people believe in this
[48:28] or not, but I think I loved her
[48:32] &gt;&gt; from the
[48:34] &gt;&gt; from the first time I seen her.
[48:37] go.
[48:38] &gt;&gt; This is turning me into a big baby. I
[48:40] wasn't planning on all this. Um,
[48:44] but I after the service, I went out and
[48:47] I
[48:49] I had gotten baptized and I I went out
[48:51] and um I was riding with my mom and my
[48:55] grandma home and I told them in the car
[48:57] that I was going to marry her. I told
[49:00] them directly. I mean, I had all this
[49:01] trouble going on. I didn't know which
[49:03] way was up. I didn't know who I was half
[49:05] the time. I I was losing my mind it felt
[49:07] like and and I I looked at him and I
[49:10] said, "I don't know who that girl was,
[49:12] but I'm gonna marry her."
[49:14] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[49:14] &gt;&gt; And so then you fast forward, I don't
[49:16] know what it was after that, eight
[49:17] months later and we were married. And
[49:20] just uh just thinking about God's hand
[49:23] on my life.
[49:25] I didn't
[49:27] I didn't deserve to meet those people
[49:29] that I met.
[49:30] &gt;&gt; Some of the best people I've ever met in
[49:32] my life.
[49:33] Come on.
[49:34] &gt;&gt; I didn't deserve to have a wife like
[49:36] that.
[49:38] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[49:41] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[49:42] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[49:45] &gt;&gt; I didn't deserve any of that. But as
[49:47] brother Ben read about, a God who is
[49:49] rich in mercy
[49:52] &gt;&gt; thought me fit to have that kind of a
[49:54] life.
[49:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. thought me fit a a dreadful
[49:57] sinner
[49:58] &gt;&gt; who had done nothing but live against
[50:00] him for 22 years of my life.
[50:03] He thought and had enough love towards
[50:05] me
[50:06] &gt;&gt; to give me that.
[50:08] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah.
[50:09] &gt;&gt; And how we should thank him every day if
[50:11] you're sitting here healthy with a
[50:12] family and you got a wife and you've got
[50:14] kids and you got good people, a good
[50:16] church, good people in your life.
[50:18] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[50:19] &gt;&gt; How thankful we should be.
[50:21] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah.
[50:22] &gt;&gt; How we should give our all to him. Yes.
[50:25] &gt;&gt; Never hold back.
[50:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:26] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[50:30] &gt;&gt; Wonderful.
[50:31] &gt;&gt; But I'll say this to the youth maybe.
[50:34] You know, sewing sewing my oats as I did
[50:37] early in my life and and as I've heard
[50:39] some people say, getting my testimony
[50:43] &gt;&gt; that'll leave scars on you.
[50:44] &gt;&gt; Those are scars you don't want any part
[50:46] of.
[50:47] &gt;&gt; Those are those are those scars lead to
[50:49] that channel of memory. things you can
[50:51] remember that that the enemy will just
[50:53] hold over your head. The best testimony
[50:55] a young person could have is that I
[50:57] lived for him
[50:59] &gt;&gt; all of my life.
[51:01] &gt;&gt; I never strayed away. If you do stray
[51:04] away,
[51:05] it's okay anyway. God has grace for
[51:07] that. I'm not saying it's okay to sin
[51:09] and be and and go against his word. But
[51:12] don't I don't want to I don't want to
[51:13] preach that like if you do go astray
[51:17] &gt;&gt; that that you're gone and you're falling
[51:19] away. Come on. Come on.
[51:21] &gt;&gt; That's not the truth either.
[51:22] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[51:23] &gt;&gt; But the best testimony you can have as a
[51:26] young person is that I've lived for him
[51:28] my entire life.
[51:30] &gt;&gt; I've had slip ups here and there, sure,
[51:32] but I have lived my life for Jesus
[51:35] Christ.
[51:37] &gt;&gt; That's a beautiful testimony. If I could
[51:39] go back in time,
[51:41] &gt;&gt; I would want that to be my testimony. I
[51:43] appreciate some of the things I look
[51:46] back now. I appreciate them because they
[51:47] made and they molded me in certain ways.
[51:51] But I would want that to really be my
[51:52] testimony is that I've lived all of my
[51:55] life for him.
[51:56] &gt;&gt; There you go.
[51:57] &gt;&gt; Romans 8:26 through31 says, "Likewise,
[52:00] the spirit also helpeth our infirmities.
[52:03] For we for we know not what we should
[52:05] pray for as we ought."
[52:08] &gt;&gt; That was me.
[52:09] &gt;&gt; I didn't know what I should pray for.
[52:11] &gt;&gt; I didn't know what I needed, but God
[52:13] knew what I needed.
[52:14] &gt;&gt; Come on. Amen.
[52:15] &gt;&gt; And sometimes we got to trust him a
[52:16] little bit more than what we do to know
[52:18] that what we're going through right now
[52:20] is exactly what we need and it's exactly
[52:23] in his plan.
[52:24] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[52:25] &gt;&gt; And that he is still in control. Says,
[52:28] "But the spirit itself maketh
[52:29] intercession for us with groanings
[52:33] &gt;&gt; which cannot be uttered. And he that
[52:35] searchth the hearts knoweth what is the
[52:38] mind of the spirit because he maketh
[52:40] intercession for the saints according to
[52:42] the will of God." when I couldn't make
[52:44] intercession, when I couldn't do
[52:46] anything, he made the intercession. He
[52:48] came on the scene,
[52:50] &gt;&gt; he proved himself out,
[52:52] &gt;&gt; right?
[52:52] &gt;&gt; And you know what? When after I got
[52:54] baptized, Brother George, he's told me,
[52:56] he said, "I I thought I'd never see you
[52:58] again. I thought you'd come that week
[53:00] and I'd never see you again." But I came
[53:02] back and I kept coming back. It might
[53:04] have been because
[53:06] it might have been because of a pretty
[53:08] girl at first, but it didn't stay that
[53:11] way.
[53:12] It it always was because of a pretty
[53:14] girl. But that that I the the reason
[53:16] became dualfold after that
[53:18] &gt;&gt; after I started seeing what the truth is
[53:21] &gt;&gt; after my eyes started opening because
[53:23] when I came I was a skeptic. I I came
[53:26] into a group of people and they were
[53:27] saying there's this prophet that had
[53:28] came and and they were just telling me I
[53:30] should trust what he said.
[53:33] And I didn't know about that at first.
[53:34] And anything in this book right here in
[53:36] any of these tapes, I believe he will
[53:38] show it forth. Amen.
[53:41] &gt;&gt; But we got to have that sincere heart.
[53:42] You know, that's something I've been
[53:43] reading a book on the Isuzu Street
[53:45] Revival. And if there's one thing that I
[53:48] can, it's a it's a eyewitness testimony
[53:50] of this man that had sat with the the
[53:52] saints that were in that service. And if
[53:56] there's one thing that I've noticed
[53:58] about those people right there is they
[54:00] had sincere hearts. They they may have
[54:02] been met you their main doctrine at
[54:04] Isuza Street was that speaking in
[54:06] tongues is the evidence. And now we all
[54:08] know that's not the case.
[54:11] &gt;&gt; We're aware of that.
[54:13] &gt;&gt; But they had sincere hearts. Anyways, I
[54:15] it was so interesting to me that despite
[54:17] that despite that that large doctrine
[54:21] being a mess in that place, God still
[54:24] moved in mighty ways amongst those
[54:26] people. Isn't that something?
[54:28] &gt;&gt; So you're telling me it's, you know,
[54:29] when God when he first came into my
[54:31] heart, he didn't check me first to see
[54:32] if my doctrine was perfect.
[54:34] &gt;&gt; What he checked was the condition of my
[54:36] heart.
[54:37] That's what he checked
[54:39] &gt;&gt; he checked to see can I work with this
[54:41] guy right here and that's exactly it you
[54:43] know that book has it has rebuked me
[54:47] &gt;&gt; because we claim to be who we are
[54:50] &gt;&gt; and we don't see half the stuff those
[54:51] people saw the the spirit of God don't
[54:53] move half as much
[54:54] &gt;&gt; and I don't I'm rebuking myself here I'm
[54:56] talking to me right now but that book
[54:59] has been an open rebuke those people had
[55:02] something that was wonderful what was
[55:04] taking place there.
[55:07] But it wasn't all about their doctrine
[55:09] or having the perfect doctrine, but it
[55:11] was that hard. Now, brother, I I don't
[55:14] want to I want to bring balance to that
[55:15] because brother Brandham did say, "Now
[55:17] we have to come to full doctrine." He
[55:20] did say that. He said, "The times of
[55:21] dancing on the bubbles, we've had enough
[55:23] of that."
[55:24] &gt;&gt; He said, "Now we have to come to full
[55:25] doctrine." So, it's not a it's not a
[55:27] one-sided thing because if you start
[55:29] going this way, you can fall off over
[55:30] here. Start going over here, you fall
[55:32] off over here. But the highest point of
[55:34] the road is the center. There's a
[55:36] balance there to it.
[55:38] &gt;&gt; We we can't we we don't need to stifle
[55:40] the moving of the spirit.
[55:43] &gt;&gt; But it's not always just about that.
[55:46] &gt;&gt; Verse 28 says, "And we know that all
[55:48] things work together for good to them
[55:50] that love God."
[55:52] That's my testimony
[55:54] &gt;&gt; to them who are called according to his
[55:57] purpose.
[55:59] The prophet says here in my life story,
[56:01] he said, 'The way of a transgressor is
[56:02] hard. He said remember that when God
[56:05] calls you, go on. No matter what anybody
[56:08] says, you serve God.
[56:11] &gt;&gt; No matter no matter what any of the
[56:12] youth think, if you've got friends in
[56:14] the youth, no matter what any of them
[56:16] think, if God calls you,
[56:19] &gt;&gt; if there's a deep out there, calling to
[56:20] a deep in here, if he starts calling
[56:23] your heart,
[56:24] &gt;&gt; you go.
[56:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:26] &gt;&gt; Don't put it off. Don't wait for another
[56:29] Sunday. Don't wait for another
[56:30] Wednesday. Don't Don't wait till your
[56:32] favorite preacher comes to town.
[56:34] Victoria, by the way, she told me I was
[56:36] her favorite preacher. So, not her dad,
[56:39] not her uncle. It's me. I'm proud of
[56:42] that. That was a first for me. I've
[56:44] never been somebody's favorite preacher.
[56:48] But it's important when God calls to
[56:50] adhere to that calling. And that's what
[56:52] I had to recognize. That's what that was
[56:54] in my life. It was he he had he hadn't
[56:57] put me through it, but he had allowed me
[56:59] to go through the hardest time in my
[57:01] life so he could bring me to to the
[57:05] truth. So he could bring me to the
[57:07] purpose that he had me set on this
[57:09] planet for.
[57:11] &gt;&gt; So he could make and he could mold me
[57:13] and get me to where I needed to be.
[57:17] Another scripture that came to mind when
[57:19] I was thinking on my testimony is Psalm
[57:21] 51:es 10-17
[57:23] says, "Create in me a clean heart, oh
[57:26] God, and renew a right spirit within me.
[57:30] &gt;&gt; Cast me not away from thy presence, and
[57:32] take not thy holy spirit from me.
[57:35] Restore unto me the joy of thy
[57:37] salvation, and uphold me with thy free
[57:40] spirit."
[57:42] Said, then will I teach transgressors
[57:44] thy ways. That verse 13, that might be
[57:47] something that we let slip past
[57:48] sometimes.
[57:50] After you've done this for me, Lord,
[57:53] then will I teach transgressors thy
[57:56] ways, and sinners shall be converted
[57:58] unto thee. Deliver me from blood
[58:01] guiltiness, oh God, thou God of my
[58:03] salvation, and my tongue shall sing
[58:05] aloud of thy righteousness. That's all a
[58:08] testimony is. This is somebody singing
[58:10] aloud of his righteousness coming into
[58:12] their life,
[58:14] &gt;&gt; of him correcting them, of him making
[58:15] them what they need to be. Oh Lord, open
[58:18] thou my lips and my mouth experience.
[58:20] When I brought my broken spirit to him,
[58:23] &gt;&gt; when I brought my broken heart to him,
[58:26] &gt;&gt; he did not despise it.
[58:28] &gt;&gt; When I handed when I handed all the
[58:30] broken pieces of me over to him, you
[58:32] know, God's not just in the patchwork.
[58:34] He doesn't just do patchwork, but he
[58:36] makes it new. He restores it. He makes
[58:38] it what it was in the very beginning.
[58:42] &gt;&gt; He takes it all the way back. We don't
[58:44] we don't serve a God who's in the who
[58:47] doesn't who does patchwork, I guess, is
[58:49] the right word for it.
[58:52] &gt;&gt; But oh God, thou wilt not despise.
[58:56] I guess if the musicians could come up,
[58:58] I just had a another quote or two, maybe
[59:00] a scripture to read.
[59:06] And you know, this is this may be a
[59:07] quote for some of the youth or actually
[59:10] I've I've learned that a lot of the
[59:12] stuff that when I think it's youth
[59:13] oriented when I'm studying or when I'm
[59:16] getting quotes or scriptures together,
[59:18] I've learned that I need it, too.
[59:20] &gt;&gt; I I get into it and I think, "Wow, I've
[59:22] let that slip. I've let that go a little
[59:24] too far. I need to get back to the
[59:26] basics myself."
[59:28] &gt;&gt; Sometimes we need a refreshing. No
[59:29] matter how simple it is,
[59:31] &gt;&gt; no matter it's not always the deep
[59:33] stuff. Sometimes it's the simple stuff.
[59:36] &gt;&gt; Getting back to the basics,
[59:42] &gt;&gt; you know, my prayer started to change.
[59:43] It started to turn into, "Lord, let me
[59:45] just be more like you."
[59:47] &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah.
[59:48] &gt;&gt; I'd got to a point where I I knew I
[59:49] couldn't do it myself. I knew I couldn't
[59:52] transform me. But it was, "Lord, just
[59:54] let me be more like you."
[59:56] &gt;&gt; And becoming more like him, it's not
[59:58] just a one-day process. It's not just a
[1:00:00] week process, a month, but it's it's a
[1:00:02] lifelong process to be made and to be
[1:00:04] molded into the image of Christ.
[1:00:08] And this quote, it it rang true to me
[1:00:10] when I read it. He said, "Now that
[1:00:11] little orange tree said, if it's under
[1:00:14] now, when you plant it out, maybe when
[1:00:15] you get it, it's a little a little sprig
[1:00:18] about so big." He said, "Now you plant
[1:00:20] it." He said, "Now that's all you have
[1:00:22] to do to it." He said, 'You don't have
[1:00:25] to go and say, 'N now I've got to get me
[1:00:26] some oranges somewhere and go to dumping
[1:00:28] into it. The oranges is already in it.
[1:00:33] The only thing that little tree has to
[1:00:35] do,
[1:00:35] &gt;&gt; come on,
[1:00:36] &gt;&gt; you have to keep plenty of water on it.
[1:00:38] And then the only thing the tree has to
[1:00:40] do is drink. And it drinks and it drinks
[1:00:43] till it drinks over its amount. And as
[1:00:46] it drinks, it pushes out limbs.
[1:00:49] &gt;&gt; And it drinks more. And it pushes out
[1:00:51] leaves. It drinks more. It pushes out
[1:00:53] blossoms. It drinks more. It pushes out
[1:00:55] oranges. He said, "Just drink and push.
[1:00:59] Drink and push." He said, "And that's
[1:01:02] you." When we are planted together in
[1:01:03] Christ, the only thing we have to do is
[1:01:05] drink from his promise and push out.
[1:01:09] &gt;&gt; Everything that you have need of is in
[1:01:11] you when you receive Christ cuz Christ
[1:01:13] is in you. You know, for a long time
[1:01:16] there, I I tried I still continued
[1:01:18] having having struggles and I was trying
[1:01:20] to make myself better. But when I when I
[1:01:23] truly and this is such a simple
[1:01:25] statement, but when I laid it all down
[1:01:26] to Christ, when when everything was on
[1:01:29] the table, when I didn't leave anything
[1:01:30] to myself,
[1:01:32] &gt;&gt; that's when he started really moving on
[1:01:34] the scene for me.
[1:01:36] &gt;&gt; And let God work quietly in your life.
[1:01:38] Come on.
[1:01:40] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:01:41] &gt;&gt; Listen, as a prophet tells us, for that
[1:01:43] little still small voice,
[1:01:45] &gt;&gt; listen for that direction, which way to
[1:01:47] go, what to do. Let him make you and let
[1:01:50] him mold you.
[1:01:53] Lord,
[1:01:53] &gt;&gt; be patient with him as he's been patient
[1:01:55] with you.
[1:01:58] &gt;&gt; He's shown a lot of patience to me in my
[1:02:00] life.
[1:02:02] Be patient back with God.
[1:02:04] He's working on both ends. Whatever it
[1:02:07] may be, I don't know what it is. I can't
[1:02:09] see in the your lives,
[1:02:12] but whatever it is, I can I can assure
[1:02:14] you he's working on both ends. And it's
[1:02:16] working to your good.
[1:02:18] &gt;&gt; It's working to his purpose in your
[1:02:20] life.
[1:02:25] Colossians 3 1-4 says, "If ye then be
[1:02:28] risen with Christ, seek those things
[1:02:30] which are above,
[1:02:32] where Christ siteth on the right hand of
[1:02:34] God. Set your affection on things above,
[1:02:38] not on things of the earth. For ye are
[1:02:40] dead, and your life is hid with Christ
[1:02:43] in God." That's my testimony now. All
[1:02:46] that stuff before earlier, that was my
[1:02:49] testimony. But my testimony now is that
[1:02:52] my life is hid in Christ.
[1:02:55] &gt;&gt; And he's my keeper. He's my savior. And
[1:02:57] he's done everything for me.
[1:03:00] &gt;&gt; And I want to serve him the rest of my
[1:03:02] days.
[1:03:05] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[1:03:06] &gt;&gt; Says, "When Christ who is our life shall
[1:03:08] appear, then shall ye also appear with
[1:03:11] him in glory."
[1:03:12] &gt;&gt; And that's my future testimony.
[1:03:14] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah.
[1:03:15] &gt;&gt; That's what's coming.
[1:03:16] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:03:18] If that's your testimony, raise your
[1:03:19] hand tonight.
[1:03:20] &gt;&gt; If you know that's what's coming for
[1:03:22] you, if you know you've been through a
[1:03:23] lot, but he's guided you every step of
[1:03:25] the way,
[1:03:26] &gt;&gt; praise him tonight.
[1:03:28] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:03:29] &gt;&gt; Sing out to him.
[1:03:30] &gt;&gt; Thank him.
[1:03:40] Thank you, Lord.

[1:04:31] spirit from me.
[1:04:40] Restore
[1:04:42] unto
[1:04:44] me
[1:04:47] the joy
[1:04:49] of life salvation.
[1:04:56] Every new arise spirit
[1:05:00] within
[1:05:02] me.
[1:05:06] Oh
[1:05:08] create
[1:05:10] me
[1:05:12] the king
[1:05:14] of
[1:05:18] oh
[1:05:19] God.
[1:05:24] and renew a spirit
[1:05:28] within
[1:05:30] me.
[1:05:36] Now create
[1:05:39] me
[1:05:40] a clean
[1:05:43] heart.
[1:05:46] Oh
[1:05:48] God,
[1:05:53] and renew the right spirit
[1:05:57] within
[1:05:59] me.
[1:06:04] See, oh cast me not
[1:06:09] away
[1:06:11] from thy presence.
[1:06:16] Oh,
[1:06:20] take
[1:06:22] not thy holy
[1:06:25] spirit from me.
[1:06:33] must restore
[1:06:36] all to me
[1:06:41] the joy of thy
[1:06:45] salvation
[1:06:50] and renew arise spirit
[1:06:54] within
[1:06:56] me.
[1:07:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. You appreciate the presence of the
[1:07:02] Lord tonight. Amen.
[1:07:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. What a testimony that was.
[1:07:07] &gt;&gt; You know, uh, Sunday evening, a lot of
[1:07:09] time you're struggling to to stay awake,
[1:07:12] but you know that I didn't see anybody
[1:07:14] struggling at all. What a powerful
[1:07:16] testimony that was.
[1:07:25] You know, we all we all have a little
[1:07:27] bit different background. We all came
[1:07:29] from, you know, different places. is we
[1:07:31] all have a different testimony, but the
[1:07:33] main thing is is being changed from what
[1:07:37] you were to what God can make you. And
[1:07:40] and that's the thing, you got a
[1:07:42] testimony. You've got to have a
[1:07:44] testimony. But there's an experience.
[1:07:46] And when when God comes on the scene,
[1:07:49] the presence of God when you first felt
[1:07:51] him, that's what changes a person's
[1:07:54] life.
[1:07:55] That's what begins to soften a person's
[1:07:58] heart to where you can receive what
[1:08:00] God's trying to do in your life.
[1:08:03] &gt;&gt; And what do you have to do to that? You
[1:08:06] have to surrender to that.
[1:08:08] &gt;&gt; It's a work of the Holy Ghost. It's the
[1:08:10] grace of God that comes upon a person's
[1:08:12] life, not just to make them a religious
[1:08:15] person, but to change their life.
[1:08:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. And I we just so appreciate the
[1:08:21] presence of the Lord here tonight. I
[1:08:22] appreciate what our brother had to say.
[1:08:25] You know, if tonight, if you if you you
[1:08:27] have that on your heart to surrender to
[1:08:29] him, now is the time. The presence of
[1:08:32] the Lord is here.
[1:08:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's a predestinated moment. It
[1:08:37] was a predestinated moment for this
[1:08:38] brother to meet the people that he did.
[1:08:41] He hadn't heard the things that most of
[1:08:43] you young people have heard your entire
[1:08:45] lives.
[1:08:47] &gt;&gt; But there was a predestinated moment.
[1:08:50] And when that happens, that's God.
[1:08:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. And when he comes on the scene,
[1:08:55] when he begins to move, surrender to
[1:08:57] that. Amen. Let's sing that song
[1:09:01] tonight. I surrender. I'll try to sing
[1:09:03] it.
