sanctify my great name which was profaned among the Heathen which he have profaned in the midst of them and the Heathen shall know that I am the Lord sayeth the Lord God yes when I shall be Sanctified

clean from all your filthiness and from all your Idols will I cleanse you a new heart also will I give you and a new spirit will I put within you and I will take away the Stony heart out of your flesh

that word sanctify amen means to consecrate prepare to dedicate Amen to be hallowed to be Sanctified to be separate to be set apart amen and God said I will sanctify them amen and to be Sanctified

church people but a God people Sons and Daughters of god good come on amen that's what the word is trying to produce oh yeah amen Messiah the word in this hour is trying to produce Messiah it's the anointing of this hour amen is trying to bring you to something that's good for a purpose and brother randam says here in Hebrews uh chapter 7 he said oh God grant it to them this hour while they wait

ordinance of Love Wonder not of Duty it's of love and love constrains us by a spirit right amen by Spirit love constrains us it's a duty of love to constrain us amen amen when you get that love of God in your heart amen young people when you get that love of go of God in your heart it can strains you to do what the word says to do Mom and Daddy amen as you get older amen you're going to you're going to develop a mind of your own and and more of a will of your own amen but if you'll get the Holy Ghost In You amen amen amen we won't have to we won't have to beat you over the head with it and I I don't want to beat nobody's kids over the head with nothing my kids are nothing yeah that's right I want them to get something in them that I ain't got to beat them over the head amen we're going to tell tell you about it we're going to let you know but I'll let you know this evening that there's a spirit of God there's a holy ghost they amen it doesn't matter how young how old you are this evening it'll come in and change you it'll give you something in you that you can obey the word amen you'll love the word hallah all right wonderful amen amen it'll take the world out oh yes it'll take the order of this world out it'll take the love of this world out of your heart right amen first John 2:15 love not the world neither the things that are in the world yeah that's right if any man love the world the love of the father is not in him amen the love of the Father the Holy Ghost come on Amen we're going to be simple here tonight good follow along with me the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost we love his word yeah we love to be in his presence and that's what God wants to impart to you amen amen and the world wants to take it out of you right the world don't like it the world hates it John 15:18 Jesus said if the world hates you you know that it hated me before it hated you if you were of the world Amen the world would love his own but because you're not of this world because but I have chosen you out of the world therefore the world hateth you I remember when I first started serving the lord that's good the people that I got along with before I no longer got along with there was a hate there because I had changed yeah I wasn't like I wasn't like I was amen and the world hates to see somebody that takes a stand for God and I and I tried to figure that out and it it was so hard hard and you'll you'll figure it out amen you older young people maybe not so much just the young ones yet but amen when you really try to take a stand for God the enemy will come in and those around you he will anoint them to hate you amen because they hated our lord they're going to hate you amen but I would rather the world hate me amen and and and me stand for God come on Amen that that I could stand for him in this hour that I could that I wouldn't be ashamed Amen to testify of what he's done for me and the world is going to try to suppress you amen because it hates it hates to see anything that pertains to God amen amen and that's why amen it's got to be more than you but it takes a spirit of God in you it takes something Amen to take out the scared amen that you're not afraid to tell somebody about Jesus all right wonderful Amen to stand for the word of the hour amen amen the world's going to hate ha you for it that's right amen but I want the love of the father I want I want the love of the word in my life I want a love for the word and when when I first started serving God there was something in me and that hunger to to to read the Bible something that that hungered in me to get in its presence in prayer oh yeah amen I longed to be in it amen I when I first started serving the lord I didn't know how to pray I didn't know how to get in his presence but I wanted to be in his presence amen but if you'll lay before him long enough amen you'll you'll enter into that presence and there is a strength amen and when you mix that with the word that's where you as a young person amen the world is shut out and you're in that secret place with God Amen and that's where we're trying to get you tonight not just an ideology amen but to get you in that secret place where you can draw strength amen there was something in me that that I knew that I had to feed upon the message of the hour as a young man I I knew God had done something for me I knew he had saved me Sanctified me and and that was a process because I I had become hardened on because of sin come but I'll tell you this if you're Harden here this evening and these young ones shouldn't be that way but the older ones I'm I'm not going to pick on nobody but me myself I was so hardened I knew I could see God moving in my life and he would send send little ex uh experiences that's right of God tenderizing my heart of softening my life and you you think it's insignificant but I was so hardened the presence of God just wasn't dealing with me like it it had when I was younger yeah and I remember going to church one day and my cousin's little daughter she come out and I was so hardened on so hard and she come up and she gave me a hug and that that experience that tenderized my heart oh my it tenderized my heart God used that little girl and I believe that with all my heart to kind of begin that oh yeah I remember amen living in sin and I was so amen I was so burdened I wanted to serve God but I was so hardened and I me and my cousin had had got into a disagreement and I drove out and and asked him to forgive me I was nowhere from being a Christian but I could see God was moving amen God was wanting to bring take out that that Stony heart and put in a new spirit Glory he was trying to tenderize me amen that he could bring in his spirit amen and if you're hardened amen amen he can't come while you're hardened he has to soften that I remember my mom I came home and that was one of the nights that I hadn't really been up to no good that was one of the few nights that I'd come in and I sat down and and she began to read out of me out of the book of Ephesians and I remember there just weeping from those words and I've told y'all this before but they're God tenderizing me taking out that Stony that Stony flesh that he could deal with me amen God will give you those experiences amen that's good but the point of it is let's not get to that point let's not let's not get to that spot where you're so hardened amen your hearts are tender now I can see my children how they they said I I love Jesus I love to go to church and that just does so much for me their hearts are so tender now amen but I'll tell you the world wants to take that out of you amen but let's let's as a as a church here let's let's get behind our young people let's preserve that tenderness amen amen let's keep them in a presence yes in church services amen where we're not dampering the spirit of God but we're elevating the spirit of God yes sir amen yes sir that's good amen thank you Lord the world's going to hate you but God has chosen you to be different yes and so that new spirit it begins to clean clean us and sanctify us amen and His holy spirit when he comes in amen not just a new spirit where you're where you're made clean we don't want to stop there but we want to go on to his spirit amen and that spirit gives you the power to keep the word yeah yes sir it gives you the power to overcome it's the greater it's what you can't do he comes in and does it amen you can try you can try you can want to serve God but until you get his spirit in you you'll never be able to do it you'll never be able to lay those old habits down until he comes in on Amen amen that's good it's his spirit in you that you're able to keep the word amen it's no longer a bunch of dos and don'ts it's no longer because mama or daddy told me to do it it's because the spirit of God I've had an experience with God Amen and and there's something in in me constraining me to do it amen it's a love of God it's a love for the word oh thank you Lord and me I'll say tonight none of us can live good enough enough come on none of us can live a holy life none of us were good enough when he came preach come on Amen but the Lord said I will sanctify them amen the Heathen and the unbeliever of the world shall know that I am the Lord amen I will be Sanctified Before Their Eyes God will do a work amen among your Associates and they'll know there's a difference amen you won't have to go around amen puffing out your chest amen but they'll know there's something different there's something different about this person amen they changed amen amen amen amen I will I will sanctify be Sanctified in you before their eyes I will take you from the world Amen and bring you to your own land oh yes I will wash you by the water the Lord I will cleanse you I will change you I will put my spirit in you oh thank you Lord amen that's the what the word is telling you tonight amen and God wants to pour His Spirit Out Among Us oh yes in the last days he'll pour out his Spirit oh yeah amen are we not in the last days all right amen that's a promise that we can claim amen that the spirit of God can pour itself out in this place oh yes amen he told them amen you will dwell in the land of your fathers and so by the ministry of Elijah our hearts have been turned back to the Faith of Our Fathers to our Pentecostal fathers right we have been restored back to what they believe believed as we heard this morning the same word the same fullness the same power of God that can change somebody's life amen amen a a perfect word with a perfect faith and that's what it takes amen you yourself have got to have faith in what's being said and what you hear yeah amen and and as the Sheep of God Amen you will hear the voice of God Amen and I I can't try to we can't try to force it on you amen but there's a predestinated Time there's a predestinated moment amen and there's no devil in hell that can hold you back from receiving it amen amen no man can come to the father but by me so it takes Jesus it takes his voice and when you recognize that voice is calling you amen there's nothing that can hold you back come on amen amen we want our young people to have what they had on the day of Pentecost don't we sir amen come on Amen we want that type of change to take place and we're all going to have different experiences amen but amen if you match your experienced by the word amen that same change will take place we we'll have different experiences amen as brother I think brother Wayne said you know some people think that you got to be baptized and then you receive the Holy Ghost but in the book of Acts there was those that received the Holy Ghost and then they were baptized amen amen we've got to get out of order sometimes Amen in our minds we've got to get out of order brother and we got the church needs to get out of order long enough that they can get saved that they can get filled with the Holy Ghost amen amen don't try to denominate this message don't try to put amen a period on what you believe amen and think you've got it figured out amen God is Sovereign his grace is Sovereign God can move amen amen beyond what we think but he'll stay with his word amen amen it's not just our own little ideas but amen he's Sovereign he moves his grace is Sovereign amen God can set a blaze here tonight by his sovereignty amen I I remember when I when I first got saved and and God was dealing with my life in our church there was there was a a time where amen there was a lot coming of the Lord wasn't just me amen but there was a sovereign move of God yeah amen no man can produce that you can't work it up you can't work it down but it's the sovereignty of God amen that will bring in a generation their chance at the word amen amen we'll get to something along those lines here just a little bit Lord help my voice amen you love the Lord tonight I better hurry up I come on Matthew 3:11 hey man I want to ask these kids a question come on see who knows why are you scared a minister asked this question at our church years ago and and I think everybody got the question wrong we're going to see what these kids know who who's your favorite Bible character Samson that's a good one who's yours David that's a

the greatest Prophet that had ever come but John didn't do a a a bunch of Miracles amen but what John done he introduced the Messiah amen he introduced to that generation amen Jesus Christ he

fire amen amen he Justified of one greater than himself amen there there John the Baptist turning the people back to the faith just as as brother Brandon was commissioned to turn our hearts back to the faith he was pointing them amen he was telling them there was a change coming there was someone amen mightier than I amen I'm going to identify him and how I will identify him amen the the Holy Ghost the Holy Spirit the dove will identify upon the Lamb of God and and when he seen it he said amen here is the Lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world amen amen he will baptize you with the Holy Ghost in fire oh yeah amen and we can we can as ministers we can we can take you and we can baptize you and that's what we're commissioned to do amen but there's one amen that can baptize you with the Holy Ghost and power amen he will burn the desire of sin amen amen you won't have to beat yourself over the head amen over sin and things that are wrong amen he'll come in and he'll burn that

just just first starting to serve the Lord and you know how amen when you're starting out the devil's on you he's on your tail he is and one of the things that he'll use is doubt yeah he'll try to make you question amen your experience with God he'll try to make you question amen that even if there is a God and you go back to the scripture you go back to when Jesus when he had to receive the Holy Ghost amen and he was led away in the wilderness to be tempted and one of the tactics that Satan used upon Him amen he would come and he would ask him if thou be the Son of God Amen turn these stones to bread amen there he said if thou be so he was trying to get him to question he was trying to get him to doubt amen even if you if you're the Son of God do this he was trying to get him to doubt he was trying to get him off the word amen and if you got the Holy Ghost that's a good sign amen that Satan when he comes at you with a doubt amen that that you're even a Son of God amen amen because as a Son of God that's your Authority that's your identification when you can realize that amen anden the devil's under your feet amen amen Jesus never moved he never wavered he never used his own power amen but he knew who he was anden the Holy Ghost amen when you receive him it gives you an identification that I'm a Son of God that I'm a daughter of God and brother brandom said amen when I was born again I realized I was no longer the son of Charles in Alabama Rand but I was amen a son of Jesus Christ Hallelujah yes amen there's power and identification oh yes I'm giving you all I got tonight come on it's good amen but as many as rece received him gave he the power to become the offsprings of God I give unto them eternal life oh yes eternal life he said comes from the Greek word Zoe and Zoe is that life it's the life of God and if the life of God living in you produce produces a God it'll produce a Godly life just as certain as I'm standing in this platform and the man that's got it can no more perish than God can perish because God is in that man yes sir amen amen God is in that man glory amen it'll produce a Godly life you believe that yes brother Ben gave me an hour tonight y'all don't shut down on me now come on you got a little ways to go come on Amen Harvest time he says no man can come to me said Jesus except my father draws him all the father hath given me past tense given to me will come to the word and how can come unless they were all foreordained to come as many as received him to them gave he power to become the sons of God because their names were written on the book he come to redeem what was on that book Thank so I can't put your name on there and I can't take it off that's right amen but amen but if your name was written on that book amen before the foundation of the world you've got to come there's nothing that can stop it amen you will receive life amen amen the devil may may deter you some way amen and and I say let's serve God now let's not wait till we're we're 20 30 40 50 years to try to deal with something amen let's serve him nowen let's give him our best our best years come on Amen good amen so there Lord there was one that came and when Jesus when he came amen they they they the disciples thought you know he's we're going to rise up an army here we're going to rise up an army we're going to we're going to overthrow Rome amen but that's not the purpose that he came amen he wanted to come set up a throne in a kingdom of God in his sons and his daughters and that kingdom of God is the Holy Ghost in you that's right amen and when when Jesus came and he lived and he and he died am amen that blood cell that was shed on Calvary it released that life amen that overcoming life the the Holy Ghost it released it back to you and I yes amen do you believe that tonight amen we still need Calvary we' got to come to Calvary and die out amen Jesus died that we might have eternal life amen and you've got to come and die to yourself before you can receive eternal life amen we can't skip that process amen and we all we we want the power we we want the gifts and we want this and that but nobody's willing to die to their themselves anymore yes sir amen this sister she used to sing in in uh brother Ivy years ago amen she couldn't carry a tune in a bucket my goodness woman couldn't sing for nothing but she used to sing this song everybody wants to go to heaven but nobody wants to die that's right man I I did not get that at all but every time she came she she she backslide and try to start serving the lord again she come sing that song couldn't sing for nothing it's stuck in my head but that that's the truth of it I was thinking about that preparing for this everybody wants to go to heaven that's right everybody wants to be the big shot come on everybody wants to do this and do that but nobody wants to die out come on preach nobody wants to come the hard way and that's what it takes to have a a real genuine exper experience you've got to die out amen I I don't care if you do it here or in your seat I don't care where you do it if you do it in your car if you do it at home you got to do it somewhere you've got to come by faith not an intellectual Faith but you've got to catch a vision amen of the word and who Jesus was amen it's so simple it's not hard amen we try to make it so mysterious amen catch a vision of of Jesus dying on the cross him giving his life for you amen go there amen it'll it'll take all the world out of you amen amen you'll lay down your rights amen it's no more about you but but Jesus come live in me if you want the Holy Ghost that's what you got to do yes sir that's where you got to come to amen we've got too many of us too many of us that never died out amen all they want to do is fight and fuss and do this and do that amen that ain't what it's about it's about the love of Jesus Christ sh abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost absolutely your problems will catch up with you later down the road you don't do that amen yeah it's good my I'll try to keep preaching here Hebrews 10:1 always love preaching this the law having a shadow of good things to come and not the very image of the things can never be with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually to make the comers there un to perfect for then would they not have ceased to be offered because that the worshippers once purged should have no more conscience of sins Hebrews 10 10 and 1 10 and 3 now but in those sacrifices there's there is a remembrance again made of sins every year for it is not possible that the blood of bulls and goats should take away sin so the old Old Testament brother B talked about it amen Jesus fulfilled all the Old Testament he was all what the prophets and all what the law said amen and under those ordinances amen they had to bring a lamb to cover their sins right they had to bring it year after year right but they would go away am me because that the life of that could only cover it could not Purge it could not take away amen the sin that was in their heart amen and so they would come year after year and they would bring these s this sacrifice they would bring this lamb to the priest right and they would bring that and that's that's what God required because it was the image it was a shadow of what was to come amen but they would leave amen amen doing what God told them to do but they would leave with that same desire that they come with though they recovered but we're no longer living under Shadows come on we've got the real thing here tonight right amen we're no longer living under something mysterious amen but Revelation 10:7 and the days of the voice of the seventh angel amen the mystery of God should be f fin amen we're living amen we're living in a time of clarity and Revelation amen amen where we've got the real thing amen we've got the real of the real amen that we can present to the people amen that we can experience amen amen we're no longer living under a shadow or something mysterious amen and we try to make it that we try to amen make the Holy Ghost something amen that you got to do this and you got to do that you got to do this amen you just got to come to Jesus amen you've got to come amen and identify yourself with the Lamb of God that was slain amen and when you come anden you identify and you come and you've got a vision and you lay your hands on that sacrifice amen there the life of the Holy Ghost that was in the blood it is transferred back upon the believer amen and there amen you're not going to leave with that desire amen but you're going to be changed amen there's going to be something a holy ghost change in the inside Oh Glory you'll leave different if you ever come and identify yourselves with Jesus Christ Christ and what he done amen amen he wants he wants to give you that life here tonight oh thank you Lord amen wonderful I'll try to hurry here good PR but as we as ministers amen we must bring the word and The Same Spirit in the life that it was brought yes and that will bring the people to Jesus Christ that will bring them to the power of the Holy Ghost amen not what we think it is but what the word says and I appreciate a minister amen that'll preach the The Message In The Same Spirit that brother brandham preached it in I appreciate that I appreciate brother Ben brother Joel Amen brother Tim PR listened to him for years and I always it was always the same Spirit it wasn't a Twist amen but it it was brought in the same spirit amen preached in the same spirit amen it'll bring a amen the The Same Spirit of that word amen will bring a a living reality amen not just a law and a shadow or something mysterious amen but it'll bring a reality to the people of God amen amen to where we can Minister an entrance and bring you Amen to the way the truth and the life the door Jesus Christ amen to where you can come in amen and have fellowship with him because that's really what he wants that's the kind of experience that he wants to give you I don't mean to be screaming in your faces here tonight amen but it's about a change a change has got to take place yes amen that's the experience that we want I remember as a as a Young Man one of the first experiences that I had with God it was a great emotional experience it was at church camp and that experience did not hold me but it was something that I knew God moved in my life and I left there trying to serve God my heart was tender amen but there was nothing there to hold me but it was a such a great emotional experience and I remember years later when I would when I would eventually get saved and filled with the Holy Ghost that the emotion of that never matched from that years ago but that's not what God's trying to give you come on it's just a a feeling or a ISM you're an emotion though that comes with it amen but he's want to give you something that'll last something that'll hold you something that'll anchor you something that'll bring you through the hard times because I'll tell you amen when you when you get old enough to get get married and you get old old enough to have kids amen that's brother said that's when the trials of Life come that's amen be be be cautious about getting married enjoy being a kid enjoy your youth don't don't rush into nothing amen get a real genuine experience with God and when you get married amen amen you won't have all those troubles and those ups and downs amen good amen you you can upset one another and and man you'll eventually say sorry where's she at she's gone ain't she come on you got to right truth amen we're trying to avoid problems amen amen get Anchored In Christ amen and we'll we'll bypass a lot of the troubles that we bring on ourselves amen that's right not trying to beat nobody over the head or talk about nobody just the the truth of it yeah that's right so that sacrifice couldn't take away the desire amen but the life that's in Jesus Christ can take away the desire of sin oh yes make you a new creature make you born again and that's what it takes it's not just the word but it's the spirit also thank you Lord amen it's the life that was in the blood amen oh yes talking about the new nature he said God has known by simple Faith by the baptism of the Holy Ghost that's the only way God in you till he brings you a Son of God changes your nature and the very same thing God who who created and made all the things and spoke the world into existence by by his word that same spirit is in you and you believe everything that God says and there's nothing impossible because you believe it anden the Holy Ghost in you it gives you something it gives you a faith yeah come on it gives you a faith it gives you a reality not a hope so but you got to know so and I'm not saying you're not going to have problems and you're not going to have mistakes but amen if you get that no so it's something that you can go back to amen amen amen Jesus talks about the house that that got cleaned up and swept and the demons were cast out but there wasn't a man the man of the house wasn't there and the demons came back in right and so the man of the house is the holy ghost that faith of the Holy Ghost in you and it will keep the devil out and God sealed in thank you Lord amen don't just get cleaned up don't just get a feel good and try for a little bit let's go on in and and get the Holy Ghost amen yes sir amen wonderful yes sir good pre try to skip some that's God looking through the blood he says he doesn't see you no more as a sinner he sees you redeemed thank and that's what we're trying to get you to we're trying to get you to a blood we're trying to get you to a life amen amen amen where God looks through you as perfect he sees you redeemed you're redeemed because he always sees you through Christ and he said that's the reason we can be perfect not perfect as sinless we we're perfect in the eyes of God when we're in Christ amen acts 2:1 the day of Pentecost was fully come they were all in one Accord in one place and suddenly there came a sound from Heaven as of a rushing Mighty went and it filled all the house where they were sitting and there appeared unto them clothing tongues lock as of fire and it sat upon each of them and they were filled with the Holy Ghost and began to speak with other tongues as the spirit gave them utterance and brother Brown says here he said well what did they do they waited and they waited and they wasn't satisfied but they waited until there came a sound from a rushing Mighty Wind amen that's what you got to do you got to wait on the Lord and He will come amen God will fulfill his word amen the Holy Ghost promise promise amen it it's it's just as real as it ever was amen amen and they knew amen Jesus amen amen and brother Andrew brought this out he he breathed on them amen receive ye the Holy Ghost and they went to the upper room amen with that promise and they went to the upper room with the promise of Joel that I'll pour out my spirit Upon Our flesh anden they went there and worshiped in one Accord in one place and they waited amen and they waited and they waited amen don't rush off amen let's get an experience that matches the word let's get something that'll hold us that'll change us amen amen something we can identify back to the word amen because that's what's going to hold you amen not not an emotion amen but an experience with the word yes sir amen you say well that's good it didn't happen just exactly like it did on the day of Pentecost no because God had a specific experience for them at that specific time and but it's it's got to bring the same effect amen we're going all going to have different experiences like we said but it's got to bring the same effect amen amen we won't be living amen one way and this one living another amen but we'll be right down the middle of the road amen amen lead amen the Bible says that the sons of God are led by the spirit of God and that's what the Holy Ghost amen will do for you it's a leader Amen on that's right it will lead you and guide you sir amen very good amen they oh thank you Lord and when they when they left that upper room they were different it took all the coward out of them yeah it took all being ashamed out of them amen and they left there and they staggered the Bible says they staggered like drunk men amen they were under the influence of someone else they were under the influence of of not sin and not the devil amen but they were under the influence of the Holy Ghost and the Bible says they staggered like drunk men out of there amen the world's going to try to offer you all kinds of things all kind of things to alter your mind amen destroy your life amen amen there but there's a true inoculation amen there there's a true amen stimulation amen that God wants to give you amen there's a drunk amen where where you can be influenced Under the Influence no longer under the influence of the world Amen but under the influence of the spirit of God and the spirit of God is here Amen to not to bring you to Hell amen but to bring in a Rapture in this hour there's young people amen there's going to be 6 S 8 n year olds amen that's going to go in a Rapture amen they're not going to get left behind here amen but they're

from this un generation so that generation there and mean that word un word it was crooked they were perverse they were Wicked they crucified Jesus Christ amen they rejected the word they were perverse but Peter's here telling them save yourselves from this generation amen and I believe in this hour I wish there was more young people here yeah come on but we're here tonight God knew who

boundaries we set parameters the world says you can only do this amen denominations say you can only do this amen and we set boundaries amen but there's a generation amen that's going to take the word is brother Ben said amen and that's this generation amen that's this generation they're going to go above the boundary of what man says they can and they can't do amen amen they're going to prove amen that there's a genuine Holy Ghost amen they're going to prove amen that the days of Miracle are not passed they're going to take the word of what a prophet said in this hour and they're going to put it on their lips and they're going to prophesy oh thank you Lord yes amen wonderful John was told to eat the book take the book and prophesy again take the message amen and prophesy again amen don't leave it with the prophet don't leave it with just Jesus amen amen there's a generation that's going to take the word yeah oh thank you amen wonderful generation that word means habitation a dwelling

yes sir and we're going to go up yes we're going to go beyond that's true we're going to go out of the boundaries amen amen oh thank you Lord Brother Bram said every generation has its chance at the word has its chance at Revival in your generation young people is no different right amen you can think of your favorite Bible Luke said David who'd you say Samuel Samson Samson sorry can't hear they all had their experience they all all had their chance at the word right yeah and you're no different yeah you're no different than them God will give you an experience God will prove things through your life if you'll surrender to him and that's what that's where it that's where it's at it takes a surrender it takes a consecration to him amen and man I think of Enoch that's one of my favorite Bible characters Enoch that that word means cons his name means consecrated it means dedicated that's right and mean he took a Rapture he walked with God for 365 years yeah and mean and he and he went on up with God as though he was not amen that's the kind of life we want to live amen consecrated dedicated to him and when there's going to be a generation that takes a Rapture there's going to be a generation that will let the word have preeminence that will let the Holy Ghost have its way in their life they will become that generation that habitation of the Holy Ghost yes amen thank you Lord this is something after I I was saved in 2005 God changed my life and I went to Winter youth retreat went to a camp just like some of y'all are going amen and the the word being preached and there's things that will illuminate you and give you Faith amen don't go there just Amen to just to have a good time or to see your buddy or whoever amen go to to benefit from it yes that's good and that that's what I winner youth retreat in 2005 this quote was read it said Luther walked in one light and Wesley walked in another Wesley walked in one light Pentecost walked in another but we're walking on higher than that today and he said if if there's another generation it'll go beyond us am mean if you go back that was in 1959 if you go back brother Brown says there can't be another generation because of how sinful and how wicked things were how the parents were letting their children just do whatever they were encouraging to do this and he the was sing there there there just can't be another generation but here we go on and I think this was left for you and I I I I've always been encouraged by it he said if there is another generation it'll go beyond us amen amen we're going to take the word amen we're not going to put it on the Shelf amen we're not going to we're not going to try to exalt ourselves above the messenger or what was brought but we're going to take what was brought amen and we're going to go beyond amen we're going to we're going to let the word amen Luther amen he amen the people of those day those days they manifested what he said amen they were saved they were Justified amen and the people during the time of Wesley they lived Sanctified lives they lived the Holiness life amen amen but you and I amen we're here to to take amen the word got to take on flesh amen it's got to become flesh in this generation Hallelujah yes so the prophet passed off the scene in in 1965 and so in 2005 that was another generation that was the year here I God changed my life amen another generation had came just as he said amen and I I was just thinking today we're almost 20 years into that generation wow it's almost halfway over just think of where we're at oh my but I believe we're all part of that generation amen oh yeah we're living here amen let's be the habitation let's be that generation amen that seeks God Amen that will Ascend into the into the the holy Place into the hill of the Lord amen how much more time I got I got eight more minutes don't I good come on you see he says each one of those ages had only taken a dip into the Holy Spirit justification is a work of the Holy Spirit sanctification but the baptism of the Holy Spirit he said that's the reason this was in ' 63 he said that's the reason it took a prophetic Prophet to come down no Messenger to the ede cuz the Holy Ghost came and self oh yeah in this fullness of the baptism yeah amen wonderful amen the Holy Ghost himself came in this hour brother brother my Ministry is to declare that he's here yes what is the Holy Ghost who is the Holy Ghost it's a person it's a life yeah amen it's the fullness of as brother Ben said this morning it's a the fullness of the word is here amen and amen and as you as as you identify yourself with a sacrifice we're not identifying ourselves just under Luther's light or Wesley's light but we come and identify ourselves with that atonement come on and that word atonement means to be one with to make you one and the word of the hour amen it's the fullness of the atonement brought back to the bride amen it's the fullness of the power brought back to you and I amen amen that we could receive amen of that fullness of God in this generation Lord amen we're not we're not laying our hands on this part of the word but it's the fullness to bring us to something to bring us a change inside of us to bring us to the change of the body amen the word generation first Peter 2:9 but you're a chosen generation a royal priesthood a holy nation a pear people be different from the world don't be like the world be different that you should show forth the Praises of him who have called you out of Darkness Into His Marvelous Light

[Music] reality amen amen I'm going to read just a little bit different scripture for foot washing you know Jesus said that you know people would know that we were disciples by our love for one another and I want to read this it come on my heart this is what Paul says love is he said though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels and have not charity and becometh sounding brass or a tinkling symbol I have the gift of Prophecy and understand all Mysteries and all knowledge I have all Faith so that I could remove mountains and have not charity I'm nothing charity is agape love though I bestow bestow all my goods to feed the poor and though I give my body to be burned have not charity at profiteth me nothing charity suffereth long and is kind charity envieth not charity vaunteth not itself is not puffed up does not behave itself unseemly seeketh not her own is not easily provoked thinketh no evil rejoiceth not in iniquity but rejoiceth in the truth beareth all things believeth all things hopeth all things endureth all things charity never fails whether there be prophecies they shall fail whether there be tongues they shall cease whether there be knowledge it shall vanish away for we know in part and we prophesy in part but when that which is perfect has come then that which is is in part should be done away and then the last verse he said and now abideth faith hope charity these three but the greatest of these is Charity we wash one another's feet because of the love that's been shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost and Jesus when he did that set an example he said you do what I've done to you he said and if you do these things happy are ye if you do them amen amen do you love one another amen that's that's how men will know that you're a Christian if you love one another amen let's bow our heads one more time and when we're done with the foot Washing Service we'll come right back in and just have a few minutes of worship and and and praise and water the word with our praise I know it's been a lengthy service but I believe it's been good it's been good I'm just overwhelmed right now by the love of God in my heart and just like oh
