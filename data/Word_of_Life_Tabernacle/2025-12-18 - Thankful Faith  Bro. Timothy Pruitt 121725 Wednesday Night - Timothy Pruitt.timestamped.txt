[33:43] the [music] grace
[33:45] that hold
[33:47] my falling [singing and music]
[33:49] soul.
[33:52] He looked
[33:55] beyond all [singing]
[33:57] [music]
[33:58] all my faults
[34:01] and he [singing] saw
[34:03] my need.
[34:07] Amen. Sister [music] Nolley is going to
[34:08] sing for us tonight. Give the Lord a big
[34:11] hand of praise if you would. [applause]
[34:42] &gt;&gt; [music]
[34:47] [music]
[34:48] &gt;&gt; Truth [singing] is, I've known my share
[34:51] of heartache.
[34:56] How deeply I have felt the crushing
[34:59] [singing and music] loss.
[35:04] I've stood so [singing] many times out
[35:07] on the edges [singing and music] in the
[35:13] wrestled with the [music] darkest kind
[35:16] of thought. [singing]
[35:20] But even then
[35:24] he was good.
[35:29] Even then [singing]
[35:32] I understood.
[35:36] I'm more [singing] than going to make
[35:38] it. I'm more than going to [singing]
[35:42] live.
[35:44] I'm more than just
[35:48] because [singing and music] of who he
[35:49] is. I
[35:53] more than
[35:55] me. [singing and music]
[35:56] I wear a crown of grace.
[36:00] This world can [singing and music] ever
[36:02] take it. When the hearts here say it,
[36:08] [music] I'm going [singing] to make it.
[36:15] &gt;&gt; [music]
[36:16] &gt;&gt; Where I stand now? [singing] There's no
[36:19] question.
[36:24] Never [singing] been forsen or alone.

[36:33] the waves out on the ocean

[42:33] Lord,

[42:36] we could just sing that in the key of C.

[42:49] many's ready to worship the Lord
[42:51] tonight? You know, if the devil tried to
[42:52] stop you from getting here, he tried to

[42:55] you believe that? Amen. [music] We might
[42:57] as well just have church while we're

[47:08] [music and singing] standing at the
[47:11] door.
[47:13] This world has been a wilderness.
[47:16] [music]
[47:17] I'm ready for deliverance.
[47:20] So I've never been this home sick
[47:25] before. Give him a hand of praise
[47:28] tonight.
[47:30] Oh, aren't you glad for a home to go to?
[47:33] Amen. A home of the soul. So good to
[47:35] have brother Timothy Puit with us
[47:37] tonight. And we're going to have him
[47:38] come right out and preach what's on his
[47:40] heart. We won't get in a hurry tonight.
[47:42] We'll just enjoy the presence of the
[47:43] Lord. And thank you all for being here.
[47:45] I know for some of you it was a little
[47:47] extra long journey to get here. So,
[47:49] thank you for being here on a Wednesday
[47:50] night. We got a bunch of folks uh that
[47:53] aren't here tonight, but I pray they'll
[47:55] be watching. And I just trust that'll be
[47:57] a blessing. The service will be a
[47:58] blessing to them as well. And good to
[48:00] have brother Timothy and Sister Ruth
[48:01] with us. We spent the day with them
[48:03] today. And what a blessing old friends
[48:05] are. Uh not friends that are old, but we
[48:09] friends we've had for a long time. So,
[48:12] so good to have them with us and just
[48:14] believe the Lord will use Brother
[48:15] Timothy tonight. How many have a need
[48:17] tonight? You need something from the
[48:18] Lord. I believe he'll meet that need.
[48:22] Not brother Timothy, but God can meet
[48:23] that need. And speak through our brother
[48:26] as he comes.
[48:31] Pass me not. Oh gentle savior. Let's
[48:33] sing that as he comes. Gentle Savior.
[48:38] [singing]
[48:41] Oh [music]
[48:44] my humble
[48:49] cry. [music]
[48:53] Oh, [singing]
[48:54] and while
[48:58] all others
[49:00] out are called are called calling.
[49:05] [singing] Aren't you glad he's still
[49:07] calling? Oh, do
[49:11] not pass [singing]
[49:14] revile. [music]
[49:16] Let's lift our hands and sing the chorus
[49:17] now. Savior, Savior. Oh, precious
[49:22] Savior. [singing]
[49:25] [music]
[49:28] Oh my savior. [singing]
[49:31] [music]
[49:34] Won't you hear
[49:37] my
[49:39] humble [music]
[49:40] [singing]
[49:42] cry?
[49:48] And while
[49:51] all others [singing]
[49:54] [music] thou are called,
[49:58] thou are calling [singing]
[50:02] to
[50:05] not pass.
[50:07] [music]
[50:11] [singing]
[50:12] Amen. How many would have a need this
[50:15] evening? Just want to make it known to
[50:17] the Lord and ask him to come by and
[50:19] touch your heart. Father, we just come
[50:21] to you tonight, Lord, with our hearts
[50:23] open to hear, Lord, just a needy people,
[50:26] Father. And just ask, Lord, you'd come
[50:29] in your own special way and touch our
[50:32] hearts and lives by your word and speak
[50:35] to us, Lord, as only you can and
[50:37] minister to our needs, Lord, the
[50:39] situations in our lives. Father, we want
[50:42] to just say how much we love you and
[50:44] appreciate you. We thank you for this
[50:46] opportunity to be here with our brothers
[50:48] and sisters of like precious faith. May
[50:51] you bless each one we pray that's
[50:53] gathered here tonight. Those that
[50:55] couldn't come Lord touch each one we
[50:57] pray in Jesus name. Amen.
[51:01] Amen. Turn your Bibles to First
[51:04] Thessalonians [music] 5 and verse 16.
[51:07] It's good to be here with you tonight
[51:09] and Amen. I want to thank brother Ben
[51:11] for the opportunity to come and and
[51:14] speak to you and [clears throat] just
[51:15] ask the Lord to come by our way and
[51:17] touch our hearts and lives.
[51:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. If if he comes, that's all that
[51:22] matters. Amen. So just ask that he would
[51:27] do that. First Thessalonians 5 and verse
[51:30] 16 says, "Rejoice always." I'm going to
[51:33] read from the amplified if that's okay.
[51:35] Rejoice always and delight in your
[51:38] faith. Be unceasing and persistent in
[51:41] prayer. In every situation, no matter
[51:45] what the circumstances,
[51:47] be thankful and continually give thanks
[51:49] to God, for this is the will of God for
[51:52] you in Christ Jesus. Amen. We'll let you
[51:56] be seated.
[51:58] [clears throat] Like to speak to you
[52:00] tonight on thankful faith. Kind of been
[52:03] on faith for a while at home and it's a
[52:06] subject I really enjoy. I I actually was
[52:09] just asking the Lord the other day, you
[52:11] know, you know, you always looking for
[52:12] something, you know, been on something a
[52:14] while, maybe I can find something
[52:16] different and just put it on my heart,
[52:17] you know, he said, I did say when I
[52:19] return, will I find faith? You know, he
[52:22] didn't say, will I find holiness or will
[52:24] I find big groups of people? He said,
[52:27] will I find faith? And and I believe
[52:29] that's something he's looking for is
[52:30] somebody that has faith because without
[52:33] faith, you can't even please God. But,
[52:35] you know, I had got this thought as we
[52:37] come through our Thanksgiving time as a
[52:39] as a holiday or a time that I really
[52:41] enjoy and and I I love it because it's
[52:44] just a time to pause for a moment and to
[52:47] thank God for all the things that he's
[52:49] done for us and and it's kind of how it
[52:51] was set up as a Thanksgiving holiday to
[52:53] to pause and thanks God thank God for
[52:56] all the things he had done for this
[52:57] country. But you know anymore it's
[52:59] almost a looked over day and and too
[53:02] many people are no longer even taking
[53:03] the day to pause and to remember what
[53:05] all they have to be thankful for. You
[53:08] know being thankful is a expression of
[53:10] gratitude. But you know many people have
[53:13] become unthankful and ungrateful for all
[53:16] the bountiful blessings that God has
[53:18] even given this country. Amen. the
[53:20] freedom of religion, the freedom to
[53:22] worship God and things. They just not
[53:25] even thankful for it anymore or even
[53:26] stop to really think about where all the
[53:29] blessings really come from. Why why is
[53:32] this country even blessed the way it's
[53:33] been blessed? And you know, it's like
[53:35] brother Brandham talked about he said
[53:36] it's like a hog under apple tree. He'll
[53:38] eat apples all day long and they'll fall
[53:41] off the tree and beat him on the head
[53:42] and he'll never even look up to see
[53:44] which way they're coming. He said that's
[53:46] the way we are sometimes. We absolutely
[53:48] will. God will pour his blessings upon
[53:50] us and we'll never look up to say,
[53:52] "Thank you, Lord. I'm so glad to be
[53:54] here. Thank you that you gave me
[53:56] something to eat. Thank me. Thank you
[53:58] for all that you've done." But we just
[54:00] go ahead like he just owes it to us. He
[54:02] said he owes us nothing. We owe
[54:04] everything to him. Amen. I I believe
[54:07] that's the truth. Amen. But we we're
[54:09] living in a time that people are very
[54:11] unthankful. And this is where Paul would
[54:13] even describe the age or the time the
[54:15] last days. He said, "For men will be
[54:17] lovers of their own pleasure, covetous,
[54:19] boasters, proud, blasphemers,
[54:21] disobedience to parents, and
[54:23] unthankful." That's a word that he would
[54:25] use just right in the middle of all
[54:26] that, unthankful. And you know, and
[54:29] there's reasons that people become
[54:30] unthankful. And one, you know, is maybe
[54:33] taking things for granted. You know,
[54:34] when something becomes common, people
[54:37] stop noticing its true value. You know,
[54:40] church becomes a common thing. You know,
[54:42] it's a common thing to come together and
[54:44] have a nice place of worship. And it
[54:46] becomes so common that we we fail to be
[54:48] thankful for how valuable it is to have
[54:51] a place of worship, to have a place
[54:52] where we can come together with our
[54:54] licks of fire and create an atmosphere
[54:57] that God can be pleased in. And you
[54:59] know, comfort and stability can make
[55:01] blessings feel normal rather than
[55:04] special. And it becomes a normal thing
[55:06] instead of something that's special, you
[55:08] know. And you know, I think about it,
[55:10] Brother Ben, as I was a young boy, 17
[55:13] years old, would go for the first time
[55:15] overseas and and and I would I would
[55:17] show up there, you know, at a meeting of
[55:19] 500 people. It'd be one car in the
[55:21] parking lot and I came in it and they'd
[55:22] be, you know, and people would would
[55:24] would ride bicycles or walk and you'd
[55:27] hear pregnant women that would walk 70
[55:29] miles to be in those meetings and not
[55:31] sit in a nice pew like you have or nice
[55:34] comfortable building. Whether you need
[55:35] heat or AC, you got it. But they they
[55:38] wasn't even concerned about those
[55:39] things. They were worried. They was
[55:40] wanting to be around the word of God.
[55:42] And I I'm afraid sometimes we're going
[55:44] to have a lot to answer for because we
[55:46] got so much that God has blessed us with
[55:49] and we're not careful. It becomes a
[55:51] common thing to where we're not not
[55:53] appreciative of what God has really done
[55:55] for us. Amen. You know, and another
[55:57] thing is sometimes people compare
[55:59] themselves to others. And when you
[56:01] compare yourself to other people who
[56:02] seem, you know, more successful, more
[56:05] wealthy or more happy and this creates a
[56:08] sense of lack and it overshadows what
[56:10] you already have, you know, and then
[56:13] there's, you know, many others there's
[56:15] entitlement mentality that, you know,
[56:17] believes one deserves certain benefits
[56:19] or treatments. Well, we're living in
[56:21] that age, right? where people think they
[56:22] deserve it because of who they are, what
[56:25] they are, expecting others to meet their
[56:27] needs and automatically reduces
[56:29] appreciation. You know, it's like my my
[56:32] dad told me years ago, he said, he said,
[56:34] "If you'll earn that car that you get,
[56:36] you appreciate it a lot more if I than
[56:38] if I give it to you." You know, you
[56:40] won't squeal the tires so much. You'll
[56:42] make sure the scratches don't get on
[56:43] there. Why? Because you work for it. You
[56:45] you put something into it. And and you
[56:47] know that's that's why people be we come
[56:50] to the place that they they they just
[56:52] they they look out and you know this
[56:53] world that we live in with social media
[56:55] and things you can see others being
[56:57] blessed and having this and that and but
[57:00] all the time not even realizing what God
[57:03] has even done for you in your life you
[57:06] know and it's also stress and things
[57:08] that add to this and negative past
[57:10] experiences and and even somebody that
[57:13] you know has where they have to have
[57:15] everything just perfect and they focus
[57:17] on what's not good enough rather than
[57:19] what is good and and they have high
[57:22] expectations which makes gratitude
[57:24] difficult. So there's all kind of
[57:26] reasons for being unthankful. But I I
[57:28] really don't want to spend a whole lot
[57:29] on that. I want to speak about somebody
[57:31] that's thankful and that you know a
[57:33] thankful faith is a mindset where
[57:35] gratitude and trust works together. It's
[57:38] the kind of faith that recognizes
[57:40] blessings even in a difficult moment.
[57:44] Amen. And it trusts that good can come
[57:46] even when the outcomes aren't clear. It
[57:49] responds with gratitude rather than fear
[57:52] or worry. Amen. It takes the scripture
[57:54] that all things work together for the
[57:56] good. Amen. No matter what the
[57:58] situation, no matter what the problems
[58:00] are. Amen. It it this thankful faith
[58:03] that sees the gift of the moment. It
[58:06] sees that there's a purpose in every
[58:08] moment. It sees a hope beyond what a
[58:10] natural eye can even see. Amen. This is
[58:13] why he would say in Philippians 4 and
[58:15] verse4 he says rejoice in the Lord
[58:17] always or delight or take pleasure in
[58:20] him again I will say rejoice let your
[58:22] gentle spirit your graciousness your
[58:25] unselfishness your mercy and your
[58:27] tolerance and your patience be known to
[58:29] all people the Lord is near anxious or
[58:32] worried about anything but in everything
[58:35] in every circumstance and situation by
[58:38] prayer and petition with thanksgiving
[58:41] with thanksgiving
[58:43] continually make your request known unto
[58:45] God. So thanksgiving is not just after
[58:48] the request. Thanksgiving is part of the
[58:51] request. Come on now. You get that?
[58:54] Amen. It's not just after you get
[58:56] something, then you're thankful. No,
[58:58] you're thankful when you're asking for
[58:59] it. You're thankful because you know you
[59:02] have a God who can meet your need, who
[59:04] can touch your heart, who can come down
[59:06] and answer the request of your life. And
[59:08] everything may be going wrong for you
[59:10] today. Everything may have been going
[59:12] wrong this weekend or this week, but you
[59:14] can still you still know that there's a
[59:16] God who hears your prayer. There's a God
[59:19] who knows what you're going through.
[59:21] THERE'S A GOD who can answer you. And he
[59:23] says when you do this and then the peace
[59:25] of God, that peace that reassures the
[59:28] heart, which transcends all
[59:29] understanding, THAT PEACE WILL STAND
[59:32] GUARD over your heart and your mind in
[59:34] Christ Jesus. Amen. He also says in
[59:37] Colossians 2 and verse 6, he says,
[59:39] "After you have therefore received
[59:41] Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk ye in
[59:43] rooted and built up in him, established
[59:46] in the faith as you have been taught,
[59:48] abounding therein with thanksgiving."
[59:51] Now, you'll find out I I didn't I didn't
[59:54] even realize this until I started
[59:55] studying on it, that thanksgiving and
[59:57] faith are tied together. Thanksgiving
[1:00:00] and faith are tied together. O in other
[1:00:02] words, overflowing with thanksgiving. So
[1:00:04] faith and thanksgiving are inseparable.
[1:00:07] True faith produces gratitude.
[1:00:11] &gt;&gt; It produces gratitude and gratitude
[1:00:14] strengthens faith. So they work
[1:00:15] together. It's not a gratitude or
[1:00:17] thanksgiving after a blessing or after
[1:00:20] an answered prayer. It's thankful while
[1:00:22] I'm praying. It's thankful while I'm
[1:00:25] waiting.
[1:00:27] &gt;&gt; It's thankful while I'm waiting on God
[1:00:29] to answer my prayer. It's being thankful
[1:00:32] before there's a sign of a blessing. So,
[1:00:34] not only rooted, built it up, built up
[1:00:36] and established, but also abounding or
[1:00:39] overflowing with thanksgiving. So, a
[1:00:42] thanksgiving is a trait of a mature
[1:00:44] believer.
[1:00:45] &gt;&gt; It's a trait of a sign of a mature
[1:00:48] believer. The more rooted and built up,
[1:00:50] the more established. And the more
[1:00:52] established you are, the more the
[1:00:54] thankful you are.
[1:00:56] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:00:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Anyhow, the more ability you
[1:00:59] will have to turn your eyes from your
[1:01:02] disappointments and from your problems
[1:01:04] and turn your s eyes to your
[1:01:06] thanksgiving and praise regardless of
[1:01:09] the circumstances.
[1:01:10] Now, it's easy to praise God when you're
[1:01:12] on a mountain. It's easy to praise him
[1:01:15] when all the bills are paid and
[1:01:16] everybody's doing good, the children are
[1:01:18] not sick, and everything's going good in
[1:01:20] the home. But what about when you're
[1:01:22] having trials? What about when you're
[1:01:24] having temptations? What about when
[1:01:26] things ain't going all peachy and
[1:01:28] everything's in the dump, so to speak?
[1:01:29] What about then? That's when you need to
[1:01:32] lift your hands and still praise God.
[1:01:34] That down in the valley is where real
[1:01:36] growth takes place. DOWN IN THE VALLEY
[1:01:39] IS WHEN THINGS BEGIN to happen. Amen.
[1:01:41] That'll change your life forever.
[1:01:43] Colossians says it in verse chapter 3
[1:01:45] and verse 15. It said, "Let the peace of
[1:01:47] God rule in your hearts to which you're
[1:01:50] called in one body, and be ye thankful."
[1:01:53] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:01:55] Period.
[1:01:57] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:01:58] &gt;&gt; It didn't, you know, it didn't do that
[1:02:00] little fast talk they do, you know, when
[1:02:01] they a commercial goes on and tells you
[1:02:03] all good thing, then it reads a fine
[1:02:05] print real fast and you can't hear it.
[1:02:07] That ain't how God want. He says, "Be
[1:02:09] you thankful."
[1:02:10] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:02:11] &gt;&gt; Not when everything's fine, everything's
[1:02:13] good, everything's great. It's as you
[1:02:15] know, well, the bills are paid. I can be
[1:02:17] thankful. Everybody loves me. Nobody
[1:02:18] said nothing about I can be. No. This is
[1:02:20] not a suggestion.
[1:02:22] &gt;&gt; This is a command.
[1:02:24] In everything give thanks. We don't give
[1:02:27] thanks for the evil, but we do give
[1:02:29] thanks in the midst of evil.
[1:02:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because faith looks and says, "All
[1:02:33] things work together for my good." All
[1:02:36] things. A thankful faith says, "No
[1:02:38] circumstance is exempt from my God's
[1:02:41] ability to use this circumstance for my
[1:02:44] good.
[1:02:45] &gt;&gt; No circumstance IS EXEMPT." AMEN. GOD
[1:02:48] CAN USE EVERY CIRCUMSTANCE FOR MY GOOD.
[1:02:52] AMEN. Even when blessings seem absent,
[1:02:54] even when all seems to be against us,
[1:02:57] faith remains thankful.
[1:02:59] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:03:00] &gt;&gt; Come on now. We'll read about it in
[1:03:01] Habacook 3 in verse 17. It read this
[1:03:04] here. He says, "Although the fig tree
[1:03:06] shall not bl blossom, neither shall
[1:03:09] fruit be in the vines, the labor of
[1:03:11] olives shall fail. The field shall yield
[1:03:14] no meat. The flock shall be cut off from
[1:03:17] the fold, and there shall be no herd in
[1:03:19] the stalls. Yet I will rejoice in the
[1:03:23] Lord.
[1:03:24] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:03:25] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. [laughter]
[1:03:27] &gt;&gt; Oh, man. I love this scripture. Hey, I
[1:03:30] sometimes it's hard to bear, but I love
[1:03:31] this scripture because there ain't
[1:03:33] always things ain't always the fig tree
[1:03:35] ain't always blooming.
[1:03:37] &gt;&gt; There ain't always fruit on the vines.
[1:03:39] There ain't always a lot of oil to go
[1:03:41] around. They ain't a whole lot of flock
[1:03:43] sometime to pay THE BILLS. YET, I WILL
[1:03:46] REJOICE in the Lord. I will joy in the
[1:03:49] God of my salvation. For the Lord God is
[1:03:51] my strength.
[1:03:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. The fields ain't MY STRENGTH. THE
[1:03:56] FLOCKS IS NOT MY STRENGTH. AND THE OIL
[1:03:58] IS NOT MY STRENGTH. MY GOD IS MY
[1:04:01] STRENGTH.
[1:04:02] &gt;&gt; SO whether I have money or not, he's my
[1:04:04] strength. WHETHER I HAVE JOY OR NOT,
[1:04:06] HE'S MY STRENGTH. WHETHER I HAVE PEACE
[1:04:08] or not, HE IS MY STRENGTH. WHETHER I'M
[1:04:10] GOING THROUGH TRIALS, HE IS MY STRENGTH.
[1:04:13] &gt;&gt; GLORY TO GOD.
[1:04:14] &gt;&gt; He will make my feet like Hines's feet.
[1:04:17] He will make me to walk upon my high
[1:04:19] places. Amen. Psalm 69 and:e30 says, I
[1:04:22] will praise the name of God of of God
[1:04:25] with a song and will magnify him with
[1:04:28] thanksgiving. So thanksgiving magnifies
[1:04:31] God's greatness.
[1:04:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. When in when in which in turn
[1:04:34] minimizes your problems.
[1:04:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. When you begin to thank God, it
[1:04:40] makes your God bigger than your
[1:04:41] problems. Amen. And it begins to put him
[1:04:44] up and it puts your problems down. Your
[1:04:47] problems get smaller and your God gets
[1:04:50] bigger.
[1:04:51] &gt;&gt; Cuz if we start praising our problems
[1:04:53] and we start praising our sickness and
[1:04:55] we start worshiping that, it gets bigger
[1:04:58] than our God. Amen. But if we'll turn
[1:05:00] around and start worshiping our God and
[1:05:02] not our problem or not our
[1:05:04] circumstances.
[1:05:06] This is what David did when he come to
[1:05:07] Ziglag and it was burned and they said
[1:05:09] he had no strength. They they wept till
[1:05:11] they had no more strength to give. David
[1:05:13] had a choice. Would he go on in his
[1:05:16] depression? Would he go on into his in
[1:05:18] his tears? Would he go on in the
[1:05:20] situation? Or would he turn to his God?
[1:05:22] And the scripture said David encouraged
[1:05:25] himself in the Lord his God. HE TURNED
[1:05:27] AWAY FROM HIS SITUATION and turned to
[1:05:30] his God. This is why you got to do it.
[1:05:32] This is why you got to praise GOD IN
[1:05:34] SPITE OF WHAT'S going on AROUND YOU.
[1:05:36] THAT'S WHY it's important to come on a
[1:05:37] Wednesday night when the devil's been
[1:05:39] against you and all hell has tried to
[1:05:41] stop you. You still got a hand lifted UP
[1:05:44] THANKING GOD AND PRAISING HIM THAT HE'S
[1:05:46] STILL A GOD OF THE STORM. HE'S STILL A
[1:05:48] GOD OF EVERY SITUATION. HE'S STILL A GOD
[1:05:51] OF EVERY NEED. HE'S HE CAN PROVIDE WHEN
[1:05:53] THERE'S NOTHING TO SEEM LIKE TO BE ABLE
[1:05:55] TO PROVIDE FROM. HE CAN CREATE WHEN
[1:05:57] THERE'S NOTHING THERE to be created.
[1:06:00] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[1:06:01] &gt;&gt; He's a God of all situations. Amen.
[1:06:04] &gt;&gt; Psalms 100 verse1 says, "Make a joyful
[1:06:07] noise unto the Lord all ye lands. Serve
[1:06:10] the Lord with gladness."
[1:06:12] &gt;&gt; I like that, brother. You know, brother
[1:06:14] uh brother Juel, we was talking about
[1:06:16] brother Juel the other a while ago
[1:06:18] missing being out on the field, but he
[1:06:20] used to have this saying. He'd say, you
[1:06:21] know, you and your wy wowy boos. You
[1:06:23] remember that?
[1:06:25] &gt;&gt; Guess I'll go eat me some worms. Nobody
[1:06:27] loves me.
[1:06:29] &gt;&gt; We're to serve the Lord with gladness.
[1:06:32] with a smile on our face. Come before
[1:06:34] his presence with singing and know ye
[1:06:37] that the Lord, he is God. It is he that
[1:06:39] has made us and not we ourselves. We are
[1:06:42] his people and the sheep of his pasture.
[1:06:43] Enter into his gates with what?
[1:06:46] Thanksgiving.
[1:06:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. Into his courts with praise. Be
[1:06:49] thankful unto him and bless his name.
[1:06:52] For the Lord is good. His mercy is
[1:06:54] everlasting and his truth endureth all
[1:06:56] generation. So thanksgiving opens the
[1:06:58] door into his presence. Oh, thank you,
[1:07:01] Lord.
[1:07:02] &gt;&gt; It opens the door into his presence.
[1:07:04] It's lift. It literally lifts you out of
[1:07:07] your problems and into his presence.
[1:07:09] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:07:10] &gt;&gt; Think about that. David did not say,
[1:07:12] "Enter in with perfection or enter in
[1:07:14] with rituals or enter in with grace." It
[1:07:17] says, "Enter in with thanksgiving."
[1:07:19] Thanksgiving is the key that opens the
[1:07:22] gate. THANKSGIVING IS ACKNOWLEDGING THAT
[1:07:24] GOD IS THE GIVER OF EVERY good thing. It
[1:07:28] shifts your FOCUS FROM I LACK. I DON'T
[1:07:30] HAVE TO. MY GOD IS FAITHFUL.
[1:07:32] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[1:07:33] &gt;&gt; A thankful heart declares confidence in
[1:07:36] your God before you even see a result.
[1:07:39] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:07:40] &gt;&gt; It'll praise him before you see the
[1:07:41] first symptom leave. It'll thank him
[1:07:44] before you ever see the mountain move.
[1:07:46] Thanksgiving is not a feeling.
[1:07:48] &gt;&gt; It's a choice.
[1:07:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. You know, Thanksgiving
[1:07:53] Thanksgiving actually comes from the
[1:07:54] Hebrew word tuda. How I guess is how you
[1:07:57] say it. Tuda.
[1:07:59] That's the Louisiana way of saying it.
[1:08:00] If that ain't the way you say it, it
[1:08:02] means a confession. It's a praise. It's
[1:08:04] a thanksgiving. It's give praise to God.
[1:08:06] It's thanksgiving in songs of worship
[1:08:08] and hymns of praise. It's thanksgiving
[1:08:10] choir or possess pro possession or or
[1:08:13] line or company. It's a thank offering.
[1:08:15] It's a sacrifice of thanksgiving. It's a
[1:08:18] it's a word is it's word. It's actually
[1:08:20] a word that is drawn as a hand. The
[1:08:22] symbol is a hand. So, it's an action.
[1:08:24] It's a lifting of the hands. Amen.
[1:08:27] Thanksgiving. The word describes an
[1:08:29] offering of thanks or a sacrifice of
[1:08:31] thanksgiving. The word depicts worship
[1:08:33] by the presentation of songs and
[1:08:35] thanksgiving and praise that extol the
[1:08:38] mighty wonders of the Lord. It refers to
[1:08:40] a shout of jubilation and thanksgiving.
[1:08:43] It's a sacrifice of thanksgiving. Being
[1:08:45] thankful even when the feeling ain't
[1:08:48] there.
[1:08:49] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:08:50] &gt;&gt; That's hard to do sometimes because we
[1:08:52] want to feel it then we'll do it. No,
[1:08:54] it's even being thankful when the
[1:08:56] feelings ain't there. It means you enter
[1:08:58] in even when you don't feel like it. It
[1:09:01] means you enter in even when you feel
[1:09:03] burdened down. You enter in WHEN YOU
[1:09:06] DON'T HAVE ALL THE ANSWERS. YOU enter in
[1:09:08] THANKFUL IN SPITE OF ALL THE DEVIL HAS
[1:09:11] DONE TO BEAT YOU down and to keep you
[1:09:13] bound. I'm still going to praise him.
[1:09:15] I'M STILL GOING TO THANK HIM CUZ HE'S
[1:09:18] DONE SO MUCH FOR ME.
[1:09:21] &gt;&gt; That's what a priest does. That's what
[1:09:22] we're called to be. Kings and priests,
[1:09:24] right? Brother Brandham says to make a
[1:09:25] sacrifice. It's a spiritual sacrifice.
[1:09:28] That's what these sons and daughters do,
[1:09:29] which are kings and priests, yet not in
[1:09:32] full possession, but they're making
[1:09:33] sacrifices, offering to God spiritual
[1:09:36] sacrifices. The fruit of our lips,
[1:09:38] giving praise to him, the fruit of our
[1:09:41] lips,
[1:09:42] &gt;&gt; the fruit of our lips. You say, "Well,
[1:09:44] brother Brandham, I don't feel like
[1:09:46] praising." He said, "That is the time to
[1:09:48] make the sacrifice.
[1:09:51] &gt;&gt; That is the time. That is the time to
[1:09:53] make the sacrifice. Praise him anyhow.
[1:09:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise him anyhow. Amen.
[1:10:00] When a little He said when a little
[1:10:02] confusion comes in the church, you don't
[1:10:04] run over to one side and pout out and do
[1:10:06] you? He said if you are, you sure ain't
[1:10:08] a priest. You pray through spiritual
[1:10:10] sacrifices and fruit of our lips giving
[1:10:13] praise to his name. See what I mean?
[1:10:14] Well, I just don't feel like going to
[1:10:16] church. You're a priest. It's your duty.
[1:10:18] You've got to be there. Well, I just
[1:10:20] don't feel like taking part of a
[1:10:21] service. You're a priest. YOU'RE MAKING
[1:10:23] A SPIRITUAL SACRIFICE UNTO YOUR GOD.
[1:10:27] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:10:28] &gt;&gt; YOU'RE SHOWING THAT YOUR GOD MEANS more
[1:10:30] than your feelings.
[1:10:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Anyhow, that would that
[1:10:36] would help a lot of people in church if
[1:10:37] they'd make their God more than their
[1:10:38] feelings.
[1:10:43] &gt;&gt; Somehow their feelings get hurt a whole
[1:10:45] lot. But you know why? Cuz their
[1:10:46] feelings are too big.
[1:10:49] [laughter]
[1:10:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Anyhow, I'm just staying
[1:10:52] here tonight. I'll be gone in the
[1:10:53] morning. It's all right.
[1:10:55] &gt;&gt; So, was for every He said, notice it's
[1:10:57] for everyone that was a priest in the
[1:10:59] Old Testament. Everyone in the New
[1:11:01] Testament has become a Christian, born
[1:11:02] again, become a priest to God. We're
[1:11:04] kings and priests, right? A priest is to
[1:11:07] make a sacrifice. And we give to God the
[1:11:09] sacrifice of our lips. So, you know what
[1:11:11] that tells me? That tells me if you
[1:11:13] can't make a sacrifice, you're not a
[1:11:14] priest. Which means if you're not a
[1:11:16] priest, you're not born again.
[1:11:17] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:11:19] &gt;&gt; That's what he said. He said to become a
[1:11:21] Christian born again you become a priest
[1:11:23] a priest of God. He said you said well I
[1:11:25] I I I don't know brother. He said we
[1:11:28] give God the sacrifices our live giving
[1:11:30] praise to his name. Says well I don't
[1:11:32] feel like it. DO IT ANYHOW.
[1:11:34] &gt;&gt; THAT'S A SACRIFICE. I FEEL TOO TIRED. HE
[1:11:37] SAID THE DEVIL will tell you that till
[1:11:39] he takes you to hell.
[1:11:43] &gt;&gt; Some people wouldn't like brother
[1:11:44] Brandham their pastor either would it?
[1:11:46] THE DEVIL WILL TELL YOU THAT till he
[1:11:48] takes you to hell. YOU'RE TO MAKE A
[1:11:50] SPIRITUAL SACRIFICE, the fruits of our
[1:11:53] lips, giving praise to him, thanksgiving
[1:11:56] unto him. LISTEN, WE HAVE SO MANY

[1:13:01] HOPE
[1:13:02] &gt;&gt; IN A WORLD [screaming] THAT'S GOING DOWN
[1:13:04] INTO DEATH, INTO DESTRUCTION. WE HAVE A
[1:13:06] BLESSED HOPE THAT GOES BEYOND THIS WHOLE
[1:13:09] WORLD.
[1:13:12] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. Hallelujah. We have
[1:13:14] redemption. We've been bought back.
[1:13:15] We've been restored. We have God's
[1:13:17] mercies that are new every morning.

[1:13:23] favor that sustains you. A peace that
[1:13:25] passes all understanding. We have the
[1:13:27] joy of the Lord, which is your strength.
[1:13:29] We have strength for trials. We have
[1:13:31] hope in Christ. WE HAVE PURPOSE. WE HAVE
[1:13:33] CALLING. We have spiritual gifts. We
[1:13:35] have Christ's intercession for us. WE
[1:13:37] HAVE THE ARMOR OF GOD. WE have the fruit
[1:13:39] OF THE SPIRIT. WE HAVE GOD'S
[1:13:40] FAITHFULNESS. HE never fails.
[1:13:44] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:13:44] &gt;&gt; We have clothing. We have shelter. We
[1:13:46] have protection. We have healing. We
[1:13:48] have health. We have work. We have
[1:13:50] income. We We have rest. We have God's
[1:13:53] guidance. We We have his presence
[1:13:54] wherever we go. He said, "It never leave
[1:13:56] us or forsake us. We have angel's
[1:13:58] protection. We have God's sovereignty.
[1:14:01] Every detail of your life is under his
[1:14:04] control."
[1:14:07] &gt;&gt; We have the body of Christ.
[1:14:10] You ought to just turn to your neighbor
[1:14:11] and say, "I'm sure thankful for you."
[1:14:14] Amen. We have the body of Christ. We
[1:14:16] have fellow believers for encouragement.
[1:14:18] We have spiritual leaders. Amen. You got
[1:14:21] a good pastor here. You You ought to be
[1:14:23] thankful. They They're not They're not
[1:14:25] just out there come falling off every
[1:14:26] tree.
[1:14:28] &gt;&gt; There's churches that have looked for
[1:14:29] years for a good pastor, but people
[1:14:32] become it becomes a very common thing.
[1:14:34] Now, brother Ben didn't give me extra
[1:14:36] offering for this, but
[1:14:42] you know, my dad, he's he's a funny guy
[1:14:44] sometimes. He says, you know, he said,
[1:14:46] "People get this carnality about him.
[1:14:48] They think I pay," he said, "I think I
[1:14:50] tell the preacher what to preach and you
[1:14:51] know, here's the issues in my church.
[1:14:53] Preach on this." He said, "Well, I tell
[1:14:55] you what, if you're going to believe
[1:14:56] that," he said, "I want you to just
[1:14:57] believe I paid him an extra $500 to do
[1:14:59] it.
[1:15:04] &gt;&gt; [laughter]
[1:15:06] &gt;&gt; But you know, we have spiritual leaders.
[1:15:09] I have a family.
[1:15:11] &gt;&gt; God, godly friendships, true freedom.
[1:15:15] &gt;&gt; I'm thankful for the freedoms we have in
[1:15:17] this United States of America. But I
[1:15:19] have a greater freedom than that.
[1:15:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's a freedom that'll never be
[1:15:24] taken away from me. Amen. We have
[1:15:26] victory over the enemy. We have
[1:15:28] sanctification. We have justification.
[1:15:30] We have a a new identity in Christ. We
[1:15:32] have a clean conscious. WE HAVE BREATH
[1:15:34] in our lungs. We we we have the create
[1:15:38] creator has created this beauty of the
[1:15:40] earth, the [screaming] mountains, the
[1:15:42] oceans, the stars to look at, laughter.
[1:15:44] We have laughter and joy and
[1:15:46] relationships. We have good music and
[1:15:48] worship and praise.
[1:15:50] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:15:51] &gt;&gt; I'M GOING TO TELL YOU, I'm one guy that
[1:15:52] ain't ashamed of good worship.
[1:15:55] &gt;&gt; I ain't ashamed of good musicians. I I
[1:15:57] AIN'T ASHAMED OF GODLY MEN AND women
[1:15:59] that'll give of their talents and give
[1:16:01] of their time. AMEN. WE HAVE REST. WE
[1:16:03] HAVE SLEEP. WE HAVE GOD'S PROVISION IN
[1:16:05] THE SMALLEST OF THINGS.
[1:16:07] &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW, WE DON'T EVEN UNDERSTAND HOW
[1:16:09] MANY TIMES GOD HAS SPARED OUR LIVES.
[1:16:12] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[1:16:14] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:16:16] &gt;&gt; I mean, just that wreck a while ago, two
[1:16:19] guys, I guess walked away from it.
[1:16:21] Should have died, no doubt,
[1:16:23] &gt;&gt; but somewhere something was happening
[1:16:25] and moving. How many times does that
[1:16:27] happen for us and we didn't even know
[1:16:28] it?
[1:16:30] &gt;&gt; You know, I know I know how it works.
[1:16:31] Sometimes we get aggravated because we
[1:16:33] had to wait a little longer here and
[1:16:35] wait a little longer there and get down
[1:16:36] the road and there's this bad accident
[1:16:37] and if we'd have been in our hurt on our
[1:16:39] time, we probably been in the middle of
[1:16:40] it,
[1:16:41] &gt;&gt; right? God's watching over us. We got a
[1:16:44] lot to be thankful for. Have
[1:16:46] opportunities to serve. We Yeah. Listen.
[1:16:48] Yeah. That's a good thing. It's it's
[1:16:51] brother as the Bible says it's greater
[1:16:53] to greater thing a greater blessing to
[1:16:55] give than receive. You know what that
[1:16:56] means? It's a it's better to be in a
[1:16:58] position to be able to give somebody
[1:17:01] than to be have be in the place where
[1:17:02] you have to be one to have to receive.
[1:17:04] That's what it's saying.
[1:17:05] &gt;&gt; So it also works with servitude. It's
[1:17:08] greater to be able to serve than have to
[1:17:09] be served. Right.
[1:17:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. We ought to be thankful to be able
[1:17:13] to do that. Trials. Well, we James 1
[1:17:16] says we ought to be thankful for trials.
[1:17:18] Why? because it strengthens our faith.
[1:17:21] &gt;&gt; It's as a resistance, you know, resist
[1:17:23] the devil in a free that resistance.
[1:17:25] What is it? It's like working out. It's
[1:17:27] pushing against the weight. It's
[1:17:28] building muscles.
[1:17:30] &gt;&gt; This is what happens when the devil is
[1:17:32] resisting the devil. And every time you
[1:17:34] resist, you get stronger and he gets
[1:17:36] weaker. YOU GET STRONGER AND HE GETS
[1:17:38] WEAKER. IT'S THE PROMISE THAT GOD HAS
[1:17:40] GIVEN US and all things work together
[1:17:43] for our good. It's a blessing. We have
[1:17:45] this blessed hope. JESUS IS COMING
[1:17:48] AGAIN. HE IS GOING TO RETURN. THE DEAD
[1:17:51] IN CHRIST IS GOING TO RISE.
[1:17:53] &gt;&gt; THAT'S NOT A sand castle or pipe dream
[1:17:55] or or a FAIRY TALE. THAT'S THUS SAYETH
[1:17:58] THE LORD.
[1:18:00] LORD,
[1:18:01] &gt;&gt; thank you, Jesus.
[1:18:02] &gt;&gt; Psalms 107 and verse 20 says, "He sent
[1:18:06] his word and he healed them and
[1:18:09] delivered them from their destructions.
[1:18:11] So that man would praise the Lord for
[1:18:13] his goodness and for his wonderful works
[1:18:16] to the children of men. And let them
[1:18:18] sacrifice the sacrifices of thanksgiving
[1:18:21] and declare his works with rejoicing.
[1:18:26] &gt;&gt; With rejoicing. Psalms 116 and verse 16
[1:18:29] said, "Oh Lord, truly I am thy servant.
[1:18:31] I am thy servant, the son of thy hands
[1:18:33] made. Thou has loosed my bonds and I
[1:18:36] will offer to thee the sacrifice of
[1:18:38] thanksgiving and will call upon the name
[1:18:41] of the Lord. Jonah when he was in the
[1:18:43] belly of well he said I cried by reason
[1:18:45] of my infl affliction unto the Lord and
[1:18:48] he heard me and out of the belly of hell
[1:18:50] cried and thou heardest my voice. And he
[1:18:53] went he said he went down to the bottoms
[1:18:55] of the mountains and the earth with
[1:18:56] their bars about me and yet hast thou
[1:18:59] brought upon my life from corruption. Oh
[1:19:02] Lord my God. And when my soul fainted
[1:19:04] within me, I remember the Lord and my
[1:19:06] prayer came into thee under thy holy
[1:19:09] temple that they that they that observe
[1:19:11] lying vanities forsake their own mercy.
[1:19:14] BUT I WILL SACRIFICE UNTO THEE WITH THE
[1:19:16] VOICE OF THANKSGIVING and I will pay
[1:19:19] THAT THAT I VOWED. SALVATION IS OF THE
[1:19:22] LORD.
[1:19:24] HE WAS GIVEN THE SACRIFICE OF
[1:19:26] THANKSGIVING WHILE A while while
[1:19:29] swimming in whale vomit or fish vomit.
[1:19:32] &gt;&gt; Anybody come to church like that
[1:19:34] tonight?
[1:19:36] &gt;&gt; Seaweed wrapped around your neck, whales
[1:19:39] vomit all over you. No. No.
[1:19:42] &gt;&gt; But in the middle of that, he said, "I'm
[1:19:44] going to offer up a voice of
[1:19:46] thanksgiving."
[1:19:47] And when he began to open up that voice
[1:19:49] of thanksgiving, the Lord spake to the
[1:19:51] fish and it put him out on dry land.
[1:19:56] &gt;&gt; Hebrews 13 and verse1 15. By him
[1:19:58] therefore let us offer the sacrifice of
[1:20:01] praise to God continually.
[1:20:04] Continually that is the fruit of our
[1:20:06] lips giving thanks to his name coni
[1:20:08] continually. In other words, it's not
[1:20:11] seasonal.
[1:20:12] &gt;&gt; Oh, come on.
[1:20:14] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:20:15] &gt;&gt; It don't come AND GO. IT'S NOT A
[1:20:16] seasonal thing where when you're in a
[1:20:18] good season then you offer or when
[1:20:20] you're in a bad season you don't have.
[1:20:21] No, IT'S NOT SEASONAL. IT'S NOT
[1:20:23] OPTIONAL. IT'S NOT WHETHER YOU FEEL LIKE
[1:20:25] IT OR YOU don't feel like it. IT'S IN
[1:20:27] SPITE OF ALL THE CIRCUMSTANCES. IT'S IN
[1:20:30] SPITE OF ALL THE DEVIL HAS TRIED TO DO
[1:20:32] ME. IT'S IN SPITE OF ALL MY PROBLEMS.
[1:20:34] I'M GOING TO CONTINUALLY THANK GOD FOR
[1:20:37] HIS GRACE. THANK GOD FOR HIS LOVE. THANK
[1:20:40] GOD THAT HAVE HIS FAVOR AND GRACE UPON
[1:20:43] my life.
[1:20:45] This is where Daniel was and when he was
[1:20:47] thankful in a trial said Daniel 6 and
[1:20:50] verse 10 said he kneelled upon his knees
[1:20:52] three times a day and prayed giving
[1:20:54] thanks before his God. He gave thanks
[1:20:56] while he was under political attack
[1:20:58] while his life was in danger when
[1:21:01] obedience was going to carry a cost.
[1:21:04] &gt;&gt; Oh, come on.
[1:21:05] &gt;&gt; He gave thanks before deliverance came.
[1:21:07] Daniel trusted God enough to thank him
[1:21:10] before the miracle happened. Amen.
[1:21:13] That's true.
[1:21:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. Jesus gave thanks. He took the
[1:21:16] loaves and when he had given thanks,
[1:21:19] &gt;&gt; he gave thanks before the multiplication
[1:21:22] happened.
[1:21:22] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:21:24] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:21:25] &gt;&gt; Come on. Faith thanks God ahead of time.
[1:21:27] When you give thanks for what you have,
[1:21:30] even what you have seems so little
[1:21:33] sometimes.
[1:21:34] &gt;&gt; BUT YOU SERVE A GOD WHO MULTIPLIES.
[1:21:37] &gt;&gt; OH, come on. YOU SERVE A GOD WHO CAN
[1:21:40] TURN FIVE FISH AND two loaves of bread
[1:21:42] in enough to feed 5,000 plus. Yes, sir.
[1:21:47] &gt;&gt; And then HAVE BASKETS [screaming] FULLS
[1:21:48] LEFT OVER.
[1:21:50] &gt;&gt; COME ON. THIS GOD IS not a You're
[1:21:52] talking about some impossible math.
[1:21:54] &gt;&gt; That's impossibilities made possible.
[1:21:56] When a God can take two two LITTLE FISH
[1:21:58] AND FIVE LOAVES OF BREAD, DON'T YOU KNOW
[1:22:00] HE'S STILL THE same yesterday, today,
[1:22:02] and forever. If he multiplied before, he
[1:22:04] can multiply again.
[1:22:07] I'VE SEEN HIM PROVIDE FOR MY NEED AND
[1:22:09] FOR MY SITUATION.
[1:22:11] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:22:15] &gt;&gt; I was actually may have told this before
[1:22:17] here, I don't know, but was in a very a
[1:22:20] couple years ago was in a very tight
[1:22:21] spot and had a lot of medical bills.
[1:22:24] Sister Ruth was going through a lot and
[1:22:25] facing a lot of things and didn't had a
[1:22:28] lot of questions about her own health
[1:22:29] and all kind of stuff was just piling on
[1:22:32] at the same time. and learned a lot
[1:22:34] about thanksgiving during this time
[1:22:37] &gt;&gt; and I learned that I wasn't doing it the
[1:22:39] right way
[1:22:41] cuz I I actually would lead songs and I
[1:22:43] would go back from there and you know
[1:22:45] you put on a good face and you go back
[1:22:46] to the back and just just lay out laid
[1:22:48] out crying out to the Lord Lord I can't
[1:22:51] do this no more I don't know help me
[1:22:52] stay faithful because you know I I'd
[1:22:54] tried a lot of things before and tried
[1:22:56] to do things on my own and God showing
[1:22:58] me where my calling was and when I but I
[1:23:00] still try to do my own thing and try to
[1:23:02] make my own way and get myself in a lot
[1:23:04] of binds and a lot of situations. And
[1:23:06] here I am like, "Lord, just keep me
[1:23:08] faithful. I I don't I don't want to I
[1:23:10] don't want to venture out where I'm not
[1:23:11] supposed to be or do something I'm not
[1:23:12] supposed to do to try to make my own
[1:23:14] way. I know you can provide." And I'm
[1:23:16] crying out to him. It's on Sunday and
[1:23:18] we'd been gone and been away from home
[1:23:19] and just got home just in time there on
[1:23:22] Saturday or so to come get ready to go
[1:23:24] to the house of God, whatever. Didn't
[1:23:26] have didn't didn't check the mailbox.
[1:23:27] Didn't check nothing at home. Just just
[1:23:29] got his clothes and left. and and it
[1:23:32] here we go to church and we go back home
[1:23:34] and next morning she goes out to take a
[1:23:35] walk with one of the daughter-in-laws
[1:23:37] and maybe the daughter and they come
[1:23:39] back and she brings me a card and uh she
[1:23:43] said this is I said what's that she said
[1:23:44] oh no she got your name on it here she
[1:23:46] hands it to me and I opened this card
[1:23:49] and I opened it up and said thank you
[1:23:50] for being faithful or something like
[1:23:52] that for your giving and I turned it
[1:23:54] over and it was from a family said the
[1:23:57] Lord just put it on my heart said to
[1:23:59] give you this money for for your needs,
[1:24:02] &gt;&gt; brother Ben. It was not just enough. It
[1:24:04] was more than enough.
[1:24:05] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:24:06] &gt;&gt; And I got to realizing that while I was
[1:24:08] crying, it was already out there in the
[1:24:10] mailbox.
[1:24:13] mail hadn't been checked for days and it
[1:24:16] hadn't run that morning when she picked
[1:24:17] it up out of the mailbox and she come by
[1:24:20] and just happened to check it and the
[1:24:21] mail hadn't even run yet cuz we get it
[1:24:23] pretty late in the day and it was early
[1:24:24] morning and she comes by and she gives
[1:24:26] me that and that and I got to thinking
[1:24:28] here God is like looking at me
[1:24:31] &gt;&gt; in a silly way no doubt laying on that
[1:24:33] floor crying out to him like hey bud
[1:24:34] it's in the mailbox
[1:24:36] &gt;&gt; just going to the mailbox and I got to
[1:24:39] think about that brother Ben how many
[1:24:40] times times we cry out to God and God's
[1:24:42] got a mailbox slam full of all kind of
[1:24:45] good things. He's already provided. He's
[1:24:48] already given us and he's just telling
[1:24:49] us go to the mailbox. I'm Jehovah Gyra.
[1:24:53] I'm more than enough. I I can provide
[1:24:55] not just enough. I CAN PROVIDE MORE THAN
[1:24:57] ENOUGH.
[1:24:58] &gt;&gt; HE'S THAT [screaming] KIND OF GOD.
[1:25:01] &gt;&gt; LORD,
[1:25:03] &gt;&gt; so even sometimes what you have seems no
[1:25:05] so little, you serve a God who can
[1:25:07] multiply. You serve a God who can move
[1:25:10] things when there seems to be no way and
[1:25:12] no no no no no no no no no no way to to
[1:25:14] to to help you. No no no no way you
[1:25:17] could do it on your own. You're not on
[1:25:18] your own. We're not on our own. I AM NOT
[1:25:22] ALONE. YOU ARE NOT ALONE.
[1:25:24] &gt;&gt; He promised he'd never leave us or
[1:25:26] forsake us. You know Paul and Silas when
[1:25:28] they were in jail, one of my favorite
[1:25:29] scriptures, they they begin to they
[1:25:31] begin to sing at midnight. Said Paul and
[1:25:34] Silas prayed and sang praises unto God.
[1:25:37] Can you imagine that? Could you imagine
[1:25:39] them? They got beat. They got locked up
[1:25:41] and they put in the innermost prison in
[1:25:43] the very center of the whole thing. And
[1:25:45] there's cursings and there's all kinds
[1:25:47] of things taking place. And Paul looks
[1:25:49] over at Silas and said, "You know what,
[1:25:51] Silas? You know what I feel? I feel like
[1:25:54] praising. Praising him.
[1:25:56] &gt;&gt; Well, I feel like praising. Praising
[1:26:02] chains rattling, blood flowing down.
[1:26:05] Listen, it wasn't it wasn't an easy
[1:26:07] thing in that time. It wasn't no plus
[1:26:10] prison in three square meals a day.
[1:26:12] Amen. It was locked up in the very
[1:26:14] innermost prison. IT WAS LOCKED UP and
[1:26:16] beaten and and they were they wasn't
[1:26:19] worry about humans and and and how to
[1:26:22] treat a certain way. You know, they they
[1:26:24] done everything they could to them men.
[1:26:27] &gt;&gt; And here they are in this situation and
[1:26:29] they lift up their hands. You know what
[1:26:31] the first words out of their mouth? If
[1:26:33] you look at it, it's actually the
[1:26:34] Passover Psalms. You ever done a study
[1:26:36] on that? That's amazing. Psalms 113.14,
[1:26:39] 115, 16, 17, 18, and 136. Seven Psalms,
[1:26:44] which is incredible to me because
[1:26:45] there's seven church ages. God doesn't
[1:26:47] leave anything out. But the first words
[1:26:49] out of their mouth was, "Praise ye the
[1:26:50] Lord.
[1:26:53] &gt;&gt; Praise ye servants OF THE LORD. PRAISE
[1:26:55] the name of the Lord. Blessed be the
[1:26:57] name of the Lord FROM THIS TIME FORTH
[1:26:58] AND FOREVER MORE. FROM THE RISING
[1:27:00] [screaming] OF THE SUN UNTO THE GOING
[1:27:02] DOWN OF THE SEA, THE LORD'S name is to
[1:27:04] be praised.
[1:27:05] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:27:07] &gt;&gt; It doesn't say, you know, if you get up
[1:27:09] in the morning, the birds are singing.
[1:27:10] As long as they sing all day and
[1:27:12] everything goes good, when you go to bed
[1:27:14] that night, then you can still praise
[1:27:15] it. IT SAID FROM THE RISING TO THE GOING
[1:27:17] DOWN. IT DOES not describe anything in
[1:27:20] between.
[1:27:21] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:27:22] &gt;&gt; Right. He didn't when he took the
[1:27:23] children of Israel out of Egypt, you
[1:27:25] know what God did? He didn't tell them
[1:27:26] about the Red Sea. He didn't tell them
[1:27:28] about the wilderness. He didn't tell
[1:27:30] them about none of that. He said, "I'm
[1:27:31] going to take you out, but I'm going to
[1:27:32] take YOU IN."
[1:27:34] &gt;&gt; CUZ GOD KNEW that when they got to the
[1:27:36] Red Sea, he was the answer. When they
[1:27:38] got to the said the waters of bitter
[1:27:40] waters, he was the answer. WHEN THEY GOT
[1:27:42] TO NO FOOD, he was the answer. WHEN THEY
[1:27:44] GOT TO no drink, he was the answer. NO
[1:27:46] MATTER WHEN THEY GOT TO AN ENEMY, he was
[1:27:48] the answer. And he knows that no matter
[1:27:50] what you do in your day and your time
[1:27:53] and WHAT SITUATION YOU'RE IN, HE
[1:27:55] [screaming] IS THE ANSWER.
[1:27:57] AND HE'S NOT JUST ENOUGH, he's more than
[1:28:00] enough.
[1:28:01] &gt;&gt; And if you read that, there's some
[1:28:02] incredible things in there that they
[1:28:04] actually begin to confess their
[1:28:06] deliverance.
[1:28:07] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus Christ.
[1:28:08] &gt;&gt; I just read one of them just right
[1:28:10] before that. Thou has loosed my bonds.
[1:28:14] [laughter]
[1:28:15] &gt;&gt; They actually begin to sing the psalms
[1:28:17] and begin to confess what God was going
[1:28:19] to do for them. They didn't know. They
[1:28:21] didn't know what they didn't know. They
[1:28:23] didn't have a, you know, a play card
[1:28:24] that was going to tell long after you
[1:28:26] sing the fifth song, earthquake is going
[1:28:27] to take place and you're going to get
[1:28:28] out of jail.
[1:28:30] Wouldn't that be nice? Sometimes you're
[1:28:33] going to go through about three weeks of
[1:28:34] maybe three months, whatever, three
[1:28:36] months of hard times, but after that
[1:28:38] you're going to flourish and things are
[1:28:39] going to be Boy, that'd be nice,
[1:28:40] wouldn't it?
[1:28:43] &gt;&gt; That ain't the way God does.
[1:28:45] &gt;&gt; He just says, "I'll be with you, even in
[1:28:47] you, to the end of the world."
[1:28:49] &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah.
[1:28:50] I'll never leave you or forsake you.
[1:28:53] &gt;&gt; He doesn't tell us about all the grimy
[1:28:55] details in the middle.
[1:29:00] &gt;&gt; They actually begin to sing in them
[1:29:01] psalms. You can read it. You go read it.
[1:29:03] It tremble thou earth.
[1:29:07] &gt;&gt; All these sayings they begin to sing and
[1:29:09] begin to praise God in pain, in chains,
[1:29:13] in darkness without knowing what God was
[1:29:16] going to do. Come on.
[1:29:18] &gt;&gt; They praise and advers praise in
[1:29:21] adversity is the purest form of faith.
[1:29:25] Thankfulness in the dungeon invites the
[1:29:27] God of deliverance.
[1:29:30] Amen. And God responded with a sudden
[1:29:32] earthquake. He opened the doors. He
[1:29:34] broke the chain. He saved a household.
[1:29:37] &gt;&gt; Thankful faith shakes spiritual prisons.
[1:29:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. Thankful faith is praising before
[1:29:43] there's an answer. IT'S TRUSTING GOD
[1:29:45] WHEN EVERYTHING IS UNCERTAIN.
[1:29:48] &gt;&gt; I'M CERTAIN HE'S GOD.
[1:29:51] &gt;&gt; It's expressing gratitude continually.
[1:29:54] It's seeing trials through the lens of
[1:29:56] God's goodness.
[1:29:58] &gt;&gt; Oh, thank you, Lord.
[1:29:59] &gt;&gt; It'd be a lot easier if we could see our
[1:30:01] trials through God's eyes, what he's
[1:30:04] working, how, what he's what he's doing.
[1:30:06] But and also believing that every
[1:30:08] situation I go through is under God's
[1:30:10] care. Thankful faith is not a feeling.
[1:30:14] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:30:15] &gt;&gt; It's a declaration of trust.
[1:30:19] &gt;&gt; I trust you.
[1:30:21] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[1:30:22] &gt;&gt; You know, one of the greatest
[1:30:23] thanksgiving messages, and it's a
[1:30:25] wonderful listen, is the invisible union
[1:30:27] of the bride of Christ
[1:30:29] &gt;&gt; there in Shreport, Louisiana. Brother
[1:30:32] Brandon would say, "It doesn't sound
[1:30:33] like a Thanksgiving message." He said,
[1:30:35] "But we're thankful for it." He said,
[1:30:38] 'I'm thankful to God to be living in
[1:30:40] this time of the closing scenes of this
[1:30:43] world's history. If I would have had us
[1:30:46] saved before the foundation of the world
[1:30:48] and God would have laid the whole
[1:30:50] program out to me and said to me, I want
[1:30:53] you to preach now, what age do you
[1:30:55] decide to do you desire to go to earth
[1:30:57] to preach? I would have chose this age
[1:31:02] &gt;&gt; for I think it's the golden age.
[1:31:05] [laughter]
[1:31:06] Yeah. Trump thinks he's something
[1:31:07] because he said that we he going to
[1:31:09] produce the golden age. No, the golden
[1:31:11] age has already been here.
[1:31:14] &gt;&gt; It's the bride age.
[1:31:16] &gt;&gt; It's the invisible union of the bride.
[1:31:18] &gt;&gt; He said, "I certainly would have loved
[1:31:20] to been down there during this time of
[1:31:21] visit on earth. But I still think that
[1:31:24] right now is a greater time because it's
[1:31:27] a time that he's coming to take those
[1:31:29] people he redeemed. Oh my, [laughter]
[1:31:32] we are nearing the resurrection when all
[1:31:34] the redeemed will come forth. What a
[1:31:36] glorious opportunity we have to speak to
[1:31:39] a dying people. He said, "What a great
[1:31:42] time. We are enthused about it. We know
[1:31:44] the history's closing out. The world's
[1:31:46] history will soon be over. We're going
[1:31:48] to step into a new day to a great
[1:31:50] millennium. That is one as one believer.
[1:31:52] I believe in the millennium, a
[1:31:54] millennium reign with Christ. A thousand
[1:31:56] years upon the earth, a physical return
[1:31:57] of the Lord Jesus to take a physical
[1:31:59] people glorified by his cleansing blood.
[1:32:01] He the bridegroom, he's took away our
[1:32:03] shame. He's put it in the sea of his
[1:32:05] forgetfulness by the washing of the word
[1:32:07] of the and the blood of life. That's
[1:32:09] what the Bible says. And he goes on into
[1:32:11] it and he says, "Now you're standing
[1:32:13] completely." I'm just giving you a quick
[1:32:14] rundown. You're standing completely
[1:32:16] justified like you've never done it in
[1:32:18] the first place. He said, "You talk
[1:32:20] about a thanksgiving." He said, "I'm
[1:32:22] more thankful for that than anything I
[1:32:24] know of. You are the pure, virtuous,
[1:32:26] sinless bride of the son of the living
[1:32:28] God. Every man and woman that's born of
[1:32:31] the spirit of God and been washed in the
[1:32:32] blood believes every word of God stands
[1:32:35] as though you never sinned IN THE FIRST
[1:32:37] PLACE. YOU ARE PERFECT.
[1:32:41] &gt;&gt; That's a lot to be thankful for right
[1:32:43] there.
[1:32:44] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:32:45] &gt;&gt; So, what a thanksgiving message. You're
[1:32:47] standing complete. You never sinned in
[1:32:49] the first place. It's in the sea of God
[1:32:51] for forgetfulness. You never did it. You
[1:32:55] were accused of it from the beginning.
[1:32:56] and you're but you're were predestinated
[1:32:58] to be a son or daughter of God and now
[1:33:00] you're standing here washed and your old
[1:33:02] book of divorcement's put away. It's
[1:33:04] dead. It's out of existence in the mind
[1:33:06] of God. You hear anything to be thankful
[1:33:07] for in that? Amen. You are the virtuous
[1:33:10] bride of Christ. Washed in the blood of
[1:33:12] Christ, precious, virtuous, sinless son
[1:33:14] of God standing with a pure,
[1:33:16] unadulterated bride. were that he washed
[1:33:18] by the water of his own blood that
[1:33:20] became flesh and manifested that he
[1:33:22] might take you which was predestinated
[1:33:25] in the bosom of his father before the
[1:33:27] beginning the same as he was.
[1:33:30] &gt;&gt; The same as he was. OH, WHAT A
[1:33:33] THANKSGIVING. WHAT A thanksgiving
[1:33:35] moment. He says, not only that, you're
[1:33:37] going to do the wedding in the sky.
[1:33:39] You're wearing the wedding band of the
[1:33:41] predestinated unmmerited grace. A
[1:33:43] wedding band of grace unmmerited OF YOUR
[1:33:45] OWN. GOD DID IT HIMSELF. HE KNEW YOU
[1:33:48] BEFORE THE FOUNDATION of the world. So
[1:33:50] he slipped that wedding band on you and
[1:33:52] put your NAME ON THE BOOK. WHAT A
[1:33:54] THANKSGIVING.
[1:33:57] &gt;&gt; What a thanksgiving.
[1:33:59] Oh, praise the Lord. How many can say,
[1:34:01] "Father, help me to have some thankful
[1:34:04] faith
[1:34:05] &gt;&gt; to be thankful for that we're his
[1:34:08] people. We're not under bondage. We're
[1:34:10] free. Who the son has made free is free
[1:34:13] indeed. We serve him and we're giving
[1:34:15] him praise. He said, "You talk about a
[1:34:17] Thanksgiving day for freedom. Every day
[1:34:19] is a thanksgiving day. Every hour is a
[1:34:22] thanksgiving day. I who once was blind
[1:34:24] can now see. I was a sinner now saved.
[1:34:27] Oh God, how free we are. How we can give
[1:34:30] you thanksgiving from our heart that
[1:34:31] Jesus Christ is son of God. He's not
[1:34:34] dead, but he's alive among us tonight.
[1:34:36] He's proven himself by signs and wonders
[1:34:38] and miracles. He's pouring out the Holy
[1:34:40] Ghost upon his churches just like in the
[1:34:42] la as in the last days just before his
[1:34:44] appearing. The signs and wonders
[1:34:46] appearing everywhere. And the God of
[1:34:48] heaven, hallelujah, giving praise and
[1:34:50] glory to God. How we thank you for these
[1:34:52] things. It's a real thanksgiving in our
[1:34:54] heart. Receive the praises of your
[1:34:56] people. Lord, we love you. We know that
[1:34:59] you are the rewarder of those who
[1:35:01] diligently seek you.
[1:35:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:35:06] Thanksgiving faith. Thankful for all
[1:35:09] that God has done. Let's stand together.
[1:35:12] Hallelujah.
[1:35:14] So many things, so many wonderful
[1:35:16] things.
[1:35:20] &gt;&gt; Maybe maybe as they just place something
[1:35:22] for a moment, you just want to slip a
[1:35:24] hand up and just start thanking him for
[1:35:26] a moment. Just say, "Lord, I thank you,
[1:35:28] Father. I thank you for your love and
[1:35:31] your mercy and your grace.
[1:35:33] Thank you for all that you've done for
[1:35:35] me in my life. Lord, you've been so good
[1:35:37] to me.
[1:35:39] Lord, even when we wasn't good, you were
[1:35:41] still good to us.
[1:35:43] Even when we wasn't worthy, you were
[1:35:45] still there for us. You [music] saw us
[1:35:47] in our faults. You saw us in our
[1:35:49] failures. You looked all over the
[1:35:51] billions of people on this earth and you
[1:35:53] said, "I choose you,
[1:35:56] oh Jesus.
[1:35:58] We thank you for that call in our lives.
[1:36:01] We thank you that we can have an ear to
[1:36:02] hear what the spirit saith.
[1:36:05] We thank you Lord that we have the
[1:36:07] ability Lord to tune out this old world
[1:36:10] and all this confusion and all the
[1:36:12] things around us. Turn our eyes on you
[1:36:14] and look into your dear face.
[1:36:17] Lord to see all the good things you got
[1:36:19] for us. The blessings of God and how
[1:36:22] wonderful you are to us. Father
[1:36:25] Jesus, we just want to say how much we
[1:36:26] love you and appreciate you. Thank you
[1:36:29] for everything you've done, Lord, for
[1:36:31] me. Thank you for all that you've given
[1:36:33] me, all the provisions, my family, my
[1:36:35] wife, my children, oh God. Thank you for
[1:36:38] saving them. Thank you, Lord, for giving
[1:36:41] them good mates and Lord, Christian
[1:36:44] people, Lord, that love you and want to
[1:36:45] serve you. Thank you, Lord, for [music]
[1:36:48] a good church and a good pastor, Lord.
[1:36:50] Thank you, Lord. I can come together,
[1:36:52] Lord, and I can rub shoulders with
[1:36:53] others that believe like me and have the
[1:36:56] same thoughts and the same desires and
[1:36:58] the wants and and they they want to see
[1:37:00] your spirit move and want to see you
[1:37:02] touch people, [music] want to see you
[1:37:03] heal people and Lord, want to feel you
[1:37:06] among us. Lord, I thank you, Lord. Thank
[1:37:09] you, Lord, that there's a desire in
[1:37:11] hearts, Father, to want more of you in
[1:37:13] this world, Lord, that's going out into
[1:37:16] oblivion, into chaos and destruction.
[1:37:19] Lord, I want to thank you, Lord, that
[1:37:20] I'm not one of those that's bound for
[1:37:23] destruction and atomic fodder. Lord, I'm
[1:37:26] one of those that's bound for a promised
[1:37:28] land,
[1:37:30] Lord, to leave this old world and be
[1:37:32] lifted up into another place.
[1:37:35] I thank you, Lord. Thank you for this
[1:37:38] church. I thank you for Brother Ben,
[1:37:39] Lord, Lord, everyone that helps and puts
[1:37:42] their [music] shoulder to the wheel,
[1:37:44] Lord, all the way from the front to the
[1:37:45] back. every person. Lord, I thank you
[1:37:47] for every one, oh God. I ask you to
[1:37:50] bless them, Lord. I ask you to, Lord,
[1:37:52] just anoint their services, Lord. Anoint
[1:37:54] the singing and the worship and minister
[1:37:56] into the word. But not only that, the
[1:37:58] hearing of the word, Father, that your
[1:38:00] word can come and fall in fertile
[1:38:02] ground. And Lord, give birth and give
[1:38:05] life, Father. Give strength.
[1:38:08] &gt;&gt; We thank you for these lighouses, Lord.
[1:38:10] We thank you for each one. We praise
[1:38:13] you, Father, for everything you've given
[1:38:15] us.
[1:38:16] in Jesus name.
[1:38:18] Behold,
[1:38:20] I want to thank
[1:38:23] you Lord
[1:38:26] for giving
[1:38:28] to me.
[1:38:31] Thy great salvation [singing]
[1:38:35] so rich and free.
[1:38:40] I want to thank
[1:38:43] you Lord
[1:38:45] for saving
[1:38:48] my soul.
[1:38:51] Oh, thank
[1:38:53] you Lord
[1:38:56] for making me whole.
[1:39:19] and for singing with all your hearts.
[1:39:21] Now I want to thank
[1:39:25] you Lord
[1:39:26] for saving
[1:39:29] my soul.
[1:39:32] Oh, thank
[1:39:35] you
[1:39:37] for making
[1:39:40] me whole.
[1:39:43] I want to [music] thank [singing]
[1:39:45] you Lord
[1:39:48] for giving
[1:39:51] to [singing and music] me
[1:39:54] thy great salvation [singing]
[1:39:58] so rich
[1:40:01] and free
[1:40:04] and touching Jesus
[1:40:08] is all that [singing] really matters.
[1:40:14] Oh, [singing] and then your life
[1:40:18] will ever be
[1:40:21] the [singing] same.
[1:40:25] Oh, and there's only
[1:40:29] only [singing] one way
[1:40:32] to touch him. [music]
[1:40:36] Oh, just believe
[1:40:39] when you call on
[1:40:42] me. Oh, can you just reach out and touch
[1:40:45] him now? [singing] Oh, touching Jesus
[1:40:50] is all that really matters.
[1:40:56] Oh, and then your life will never be
[1:41:03] the same.
[1:41:07] Oh, and there's only [singing]
[1:41:10] only one way
[1:41:13] to touch him.
[1:41:17] Oh, [singing] just [music] believe
[1:41:21] when you call on
[1:41:24] his name. I like this verse here.
[1:41:27] Oh, a woman
[1:41:31] tried many [singing]
[1:41:34] physicians.
[1:41:38] Oh, and [singing] yet grew worse,
[1:41:41] so to Jesus
[1:41:44] she came. [singing]
[1:41:49] And with the crowd
[1:41:52] they tried [singing] to
[1:41:55] restrain her.
[1:41:58] Oh,
[1:42:00] she whispered
[1:42:02] these words through her pain. [singing]
[1:42:08] Oh, singing, touching Jesus
[1:42:13] is all that really [music and singing]
[1:42:16] matters.
[1:42:19] Oh, and then your life [singing] will
[1:42:23] never be
[1:42:26] the same.
[1:42:29] [music]
[1:42:30] And there's only [singing]
[1:42:33] only one way to touch him.
[1:42:40] Oh, just [singing and music]
[1:42:41] believe
[1:42:43] when you call on
[1:42:46] his name. [singing and music]
[1:42:49] I like this one here. Now I was bound
[1:42:53] when I knelt
[1:42:56] at that old altar.
[1:43:00] Oh, but they said Jesus
[1:43:04] he could beat [singing] it [music] pre.
[1:43:10] Oh, [singing]
[1:43:11] and with this prisoner
[1:43:14] I finally
[1:43:17] touched Jesus. [singing]
[1:43:20] Oh, he set me free. Oh, praise the Lord.
[1:43:26] Free indeed. Aren't you thankful for
