[25:20] that's the first commandment with

[25:26] long on the earth so we
[25:28] thank god for that promise today good to
[25:30] be a christian today
[25:32] matthew chapter 13 and verses 45 and 46
[25:37] he says again the kingdom of heaven is
[25:39] likened to a merchant man
[25:41] seeking goodly pearls who
[25:44] when he had found one pearl of great
[25:46] price
[25:48] went and sold all that he had
[25:51] and bought it and pray the lord without
[25:54] his blessing to the reading of the word
[25:55] you may be seated
[26:00] i want to speak to you this morning on
[26:02] the value of a virtuous woman
[26:08] there was a man by the name of g
[26:09] campbell morgan was a great preacher in
[26:11] the last century and he had four sons
[26:13] who were all preachers
[26:16] and someone came into a place where all
[26:18] the family was there and
[26:20] they asked one of his sons his name was
[26:22] howard they asked howard this question
[26:24] said howard who is the greatest preacher
[26:26] in your family
[26:28] of course he would thought he would say
[26:29] his dad or perhaps himself or one of his
[26:31] brothers
[26:33] and howard looked at his father for a
[26:36] moment and then he looked across at the
[26:39] at the man and he said my mother
[26:43] out of all them preachers he said my
[26:45] mother is the greatest preacher in the
[26:46] family
[26:47] of course she didn't preach behind a
[26:49] pulpit but
[26:51] brother branham would tell us this way
[26:52] he said i think there's five gospels
[26:55] matthew mark luke john and mother
[26:58] because he said mother gets them when
[26:59] they're young before they're old enough
[27:01] to read
[27:01] matthew mark luke and john they hear
[27:04] from mother
[27:06] a mother can teach a child before
[27:09] they're old enough to even read the word
[27:12] and and learn from the bible
[27:14] and so it's important what a mother
[27:16] teaches the book of proverbs says it
[27:18] this way
[27:20] proverbs 31 and 1 the words of king
[27:22] lemuel
[27:24] the prophecy that his mother taught him
[27:27] so his mother taught him a prophecy
[27:31] brother branham tells us that every
[27:32] mother is a preacher
[27:35] and god gives her a little congregation
[27:37] at home
[27:38] to preach to and and so
[27:41] that's a great responsibility isn't it
[27:44] to be able to do that and and today i
[27:46] think i
[27:47] was talking with my mother this morning
[27:49] and i think that
[27:50] mothers care for their children today
[27:52] they really do they
[27:53] they take care of them and i see mothers
[27:55] that they wouldn't let anything
[27:57] happen to their little babies and that's
[27:59] a mother that's a good thing
[28:01] but there's got to be something even
[28:04] beyond that
[28:04] as a christian mother it's beyond even
[28:07] caring for their natural
[28:08] welfare but it's teaching that child
[28:11] from the time they're even born
[28:14] to be able to to believe the gospel
[28:17] to to believe in christ to love god with
[28:20] all their heart
[28:22] to go to church when the doors are open
[28:23] things that that are taught by mother's
[28:26] example in a mother's life
[28:27] and a mother's words from the time that
[28:31] they're born from the time they're very
[28:32] little and you don't understand and i
[28:34] see
[28:35] most many of our mothers aren't here
[28:37] this morning because for different
[28:38] reasons but
[28:40] i see sometimes they struggle with their
[28:42] little babies in church and
[28:43] and that's difficult to do it's hard to
[28:46] to keep up
[28:46] and and i know jason and emily can
[28:50] can uh identify with this today but
[28:54] it's hard to keep up with your little
[28:55] one in church and i watch them and
[28:57] sometimes they don't get anything i
[28:58] don't think my wife got anything out of
[29:00] church for a couple years and
[29:02] and and that's difficult but the fact
[29:04] that you go
[29:05] you bring them you you you pay attention
[29:08] to the word of god is teaching that baby
[29:11] even as a baby is teaching on a prophecy
[29:14] it's teaching them how what a mother
[29:16] what kind of prophecy did
[29:18] can this king's mother teach him it
[29:20] taught him
[29:22] about what a woman was about what a real
[29:25] mother was
[29:26] about what a real woman of god would be
[29:29] and that's the prophecy that you're
[29:31] teaching your children today
[29:32] that a real mom will take her children
[29:35] to church and
[29:36] and love them with all of her heart and
[29:38] give them that that
[29:39] solid foundation that no matter what
[29:41] happens in their life from there on
[29:43] they can always go back to that and
[29:45] there's a promise in the word that says
[29:47] train up a child in a way that they
[29:49] should go and when they're old
[29:51] they won't depart from it they may bend
[29:54] back and forth now but if you train them
[29:56] up
[29:56] according to their bit according to the
[29:58] way they should go when they're
[30:00] old they will they will come back
[30:02] they've got something to come back
[30:04] to because they were trained right
[30:08] so that's it's a great responsibility a
[30:11] solemn
[30:12] obligation that a mother has to teach
[30:15] your children
[30:17] and i think we could take that in a
[30:19] spiritual way
[30:21] as i'm just talking to you from my heart
[30:24] this morning but
[30:25] in a spiritual way a church has a great
[30:27] obligation
[30:28] to their newborn babies in christ to the
[30:31] young people to the
[30:32] to the children to the people who would
[30:34] be coming to the church
[30:35] we have an obligation to train them up
[30:38] right and to teach
[30:39] them the things and sometimes you may
[30:41] get bored and think well that's simple
[30:42] that's something
[30:43] i already knew but not everybody does
[30:46] because they've got to learn their abcs
[30:48] before they can learn the algebra right
[30:50] so we have an obligation to the first
[30:52] person that
[30:53] if you're in a message home the first
[30:55] person to present the message to the
[30:57] baby
[30:57] is the mother and she may not do that by
[31:00] saying this is what we believe in this
[31:01] but she does that by the way she lives
[31:04] right she doesn't do certain things and
[31:06] go certain places and
[31:07] act certain ways she's a she's a
[31:09] believer and the child
[31:10] knows that and it knows what a a
[31:13] believer is what a believing woman ought
[31:16] to be
[31:17] and it's important
[31:20] and so in proverbs 31 it goes on in
[31:24] verse 10 to say who can find a virtuous
[31:26] woman
[31:28] for her price is far above
[31:32] rubies and that word i just kind of want
[31:35] to break this down for a moment because
[31:37] it's important
[31:38] i just want us to ponder it to dwell on
[31:40] it you know sometimes great things can
[31:42] happen in your life your life can be
[31:44] changed
[31:45] just because you spent a few minutes
[31:47] pondering and looking at the word of god
[31:50] and just looking at it soberly and
[31:52] thinking because there's power in this
[31:53] word
[31:55] and but and the bible teaches us who can
[31:58] find a virtuous woman in other words
[32:00] she's rare
[32:02] she's scarce who can find a virtuous
[32:05] woman
[32:07] or price is far above rubies that virtue
[32:09] is strength
[32:10] or power it's not virtue as we would
[32:12] think of being a moral
[32:14] person though it would be that because
[32:16] the person has to have strength to stand
[32:17] for morality in the day that we live in
[32:20] but a virtuous woman is not just a woman
[32:22] who does everything right
[32:24] but it's that word is actually strength
[32:26] or power it literally means
[32:28] efficiency might wealth or an army
[32:34] you ever think about a mother as a whole
[32:36] army
[32:40] and and that that would be i saw
[32:42] something this morning i think my mother
[32:44] shared that there was a whole bunch of
[32:47] different jobs that a mother did so we
[32:48] got somebody to replace you and there's
[32:50] about 12 people out there
[32:52] and so that's a virtuous woman it's the
[32:54] idea of strength like when
[32:56] jesus was touched by the woman with the
[32:58] blood issue and he said virtue has gone
[33:00] from me it's that idea of virtue it's
[33:02] strength
[33:04] it's gone from who can find this kind of
[33:07] a woman a strong woman it's the idea of
[33:09] worth or
[33:09] excellence who can find that kind of a
[33:13] woman
[33:15] because her price that price is value
[33:19] her value is far above rubies and that
[33:23] that word rubies is actually
[33:26] a round gemstone and so it's probably a
[33:29] pearl
[33:30] a pearl and we know that the pearl is
[33:34] rare
[33:35] and jesus uses that in the parable he
[33:37] says if
[33:38] that merchant could find a pearl of
[33:40] great price
[33:42] he would sell all that he had to go
[33:45] get that pearl because it's so
[33:48] rare and a virtuous woman
[33:52] this kind of a woman that proverbs 31
[33:54] talks about
[33:56] is a rare thing in the day and age that
[33:58] we live in
[34:00] and so i take my hat off to you today if
[34:02] i had one on or
[34:03] i i'll salute you today as as mothers
[34:06] that are here
[34:07] that are watching this morning because
[34:10] you
[34:11] are doing something that is it's hard to
[34:14] find
[34:16] and it's valuable because of its number
[34:18] one because of its scarcity
[34:21] it's difficult to find a virtuous woman
[34:23] he says who can find
[34:24] a virtuous woman her values more than
[34:28] pearls
[34:29] and pearls are interesting because
[34:31] they're extremely unique
[34:34] and they're the only gemstone that's
[34:36] found in a living creature they come
[34:37] from
[34:38] a clam or a mollusk they're found within
[34:42] that living creature deep in the ocean
[34:46] and unlike diamonds or rubies or
[34:48] emeralds pearls require no cutting
[34:51] you don't have to polish them but when
[34:54] they
[34:54] when you find them that's the form that
[34:57] they're worn it
[34:58] in in jewelry that's the form that
[35:00] they're worth
[35:02] something in it's the form that you find
[35:04] them in
[35:06] they naturally form just in a certain
[35:09] way to be a
[35:10] a perfect color and just and they're all
[35:12] different
[35:14] but they're so very rare that only one
[35:16] in several million
[35:18] shellfish yield a pearl one in
[35:21] several million and so
[35:25] the the writer is saying who can find
[35:27] that kind of a
[35:29] a rarity who can find it
[35:32] i believe that i found one and i had one
[35:35] for a mother and i i trust that you did
[35:37] as well
[35:38] but it's not common who can find it
[35:43] and so you know but there's a different
[35:46] kind of pearl that you've probably seen
[35:48] maybe you have some at the house
[35:50] you may have some real pearls at the
[35:51] house i don't know
[35:53] but there's what they call a cultured
[35:54] pearl
[35:56] and a cultured pearl is very beautiful
[35:59] in fact
[35:59] more beautiful than a natural pearl and
[36:02] you can't tell from the outside
[36:04] whether it's a cultured pearl or a
[36:06] natural pearl
[36:08] and what they do is if you to know that
[36:10] you have a a natural pearl they have to
[36:12] give you an x-ray certificate
[36:14] that they've actually x-rayed the stone
[36:17] to find out what's on the inside of it
[36:19] because you can only tell the difference
[36:22] in a natural pearl in a cultured pearl
[36:24] based on what's on the inside oh i think
[36:28] christians are like that too
[36:30] i think a christian mother is like that
[36:32] too you can only really tell the
[36:34] difference based on
[36:35] what's on the inside what's on the heart
[36:37] and many times the outside may not be so
[36:40] look so beautiful because the the
[36:43] cultured pearl the one that
[36:44] they grew in a farm in fresh water those
[36:47] kind of pearls are
[36:48] much more beautiful but worth much less
[36:51] money
[36:52] there are much less value why because
[36:55] they're not rare
[36:57] you can grow they can grow them in a
[36:59] couple years
[37:00] where a natural pearl takes a lifetime
[37:04] to grow and so it's it's of great
[37:08] price it's hard to find one in a million
[37:12] and so it's more beautiful a cultured
[37:15] pearl is more beautiful but less
[37:17] character first peter three and three
[37:19] speaks of a woman a godly christian
[37:21] woman who said who's adorning
[37:23] let it not be that outward adorning of
[37:25] plating the hair and that would be
[37:27] back then they would they would braid it
[37:29] and then they'd put all kinds of stuff
[37:30] in it
[37:31] and of wearing of gold or putting on of
[37:33] apparel
[37:34] he said don't let it be that but let it
[37:37] be the hidden man of the heart
[37:39] the hidden man of the heart that's you
[37:42] when you use the x-ray machine you can
[37:44] see
[37:44] there's something beautiful on the
[37:46] inside that was
[37:47] formed over a lifetime
[37:51] let it be the hidden man of the heart
[37:53] and that which is not corruptable
[37:54] even the ornament amen of a meek and a
[37:58] quiet
[37:59] spirit not something created by max
[38:02] factor or whoever the the person might
[38:05] be today that makes the makeup and the
[38:06] jewelry
[38:07] not something created by that but
[38:08] something beautiful on the inside
[38:12] people make and i see this even as
[38:14] message young people make such mistakes
[38:16] when it comes to choosing someone for a
[38:19] wife
[38:20] or a husband i see this in girls too
[38:22] especially with guys
[38:24] they'll look for some guy that's tall
[38:25] dark and handsome and don't realize that
[38:27] the guy
[38:28] that they've overlooked the whole time
[38:30] might be the one that could really
[38:32] help them in their life and they're not
[38:34] really looking for character
[38:36] but they're looking for something that
[38:38] looks good on facebook
[38:41] but on the inside is what matters when
[38:43] the kids are sick and
[38:45] and and nothing's going right and he
[38:47] lost his job and
[38:48] she she doesn't have anything hardly to
[38:51] wear and
[38:52] and everything's going wrong that's the
[38:54] moments when it shows what's on the
[38:56] inside
[38:58] when you're mad at one another and you
[39:00] can't you you just just can't hardly
[39:02] stand to be around one another
[39:04] and my mom excuse me for using this but
[39:06] she was we were talking this morning and
[39:08] and i'm thankful for the opportunity
[39:10] that i've had and she's drove these
[39:12] miles to come to church and be with us
[39:13] and and i get to talk to her because we
[39:16] ministry
[39:17] kept us apart for a long time because
[39:18] just in a different place but
[39:20] thankful to have my mom but she was
[39:22] talking this morning how that
[39:24] my dad had told her before he died he
[39:26] said no matter how mad you were at me
[39:28] you always fixed my breakfast
[39:33] well that something to that effect that
[39:34] that meant something you know
[39:37] that's what matters it's a character
[39:38] there's something there
[39:40] that means something beyond what we can
[39:43] what we can
[39:44] put on on the outside a character and
[39:47] that's what we should look for in
[39:48] a husband or a wife or whatever the case
[39:51] might be
[39:52] but it's a pearl and it's in the sight
[39:55] of god of great value
[39:57] pearls are formed when an irritant
[40:01] which is usually a grain of sand or some
[40:03] kind of food
[40:05] gets deep enough inside the shell of a
[40:08] mollusk
[40:09] that it can't get it out it's it's like
[40:13] paul's thorn in the flesh he said i
[40:14] prayed and god said
[40:15] my strength my grace is sufficient for
[40:18] thee
[40:20] an irritant on the inside that gets
[40:23] inside and it just can't eradicate it
[40:25] and it causes the shell to produce a
[40:27] substance called
[40:28] naker which coats the irritant and it
[40:32] keeps coating it year after year after
[40:34] year
[40:35] to protect the the shell or the mollusk
[40:38] it coats the irritant with the shiny
[40:40] substance
[40:41] that's found in the interior of the
[40:43] shell and eventually that becomes a
[40:45] pearl
[40:47] but it takes years now i found it
[40:50] interesting in revelation 21
[40:52] 21 that the 12 gates of new jerusalem
[40:55] are
[40:55] 12 pearls and i don't know if you've
[40:58] ever realized this but they weren't
[41:00] made up of lots of pearls right and
[41:03] these are big gates
[41:06] right great big gates in the wall of the
[41:08] new jerusalem and they're not made up of
[41:10] any pearls
[41:13] every several gate was one pearl
[41:17] now think with me for a moment what kind
[41:20] of irritant
[41:22] would it take
[41:26] to make a pearl big enough to make a
[41:27] gate out of
[41:31] think about that for a moment see we
[41:34] don't always realize what god's doing in
[41:36] our life
[41:38] what kind of irritant would it take well
[41:40] go back and look at those
[41:42] each one of these gates was named after
[41:44] one of the 12 patriarchs one on each
[41:46] gate
[41:47] and if you went back and look and we
[41:48] won't go to all of them to save time but
[41:50] we'll just go to one
[41:52] you find joseph joseph was a man
[41:55] who'd done nothing wrong but he was
[41:58] persecuted
[41:59] and the bible says in psalms 105 17 he
[42:02] sent a man before them even joseph who
[42:04] was sold for a servant
[42:05] whose feet they hurt with fetters he was
[42:08] laid in iron
[42:09] until the time that his word came the
[42:12] word of the lord tried him now think
[42:16] about this for a moment
[42:17] what could make his life like a pearl
[42:21] that would be large enough to make up a
[42:24] gate of the of that city
[42:28] what kind of irritant would it take it
[42:30] actually took the word of god
[42:35] see many times and i hope i'm not
[42:38] getting too far off the path here but
[42:39] many times
[42:41] it's the it's the word that you believe
[42:44] that is the irritant in your life
[42:49] hang with me for a moment he said i
[42:51] would never call the word an irritated
[42:52] but think about it
[42:54] many times that's what tries you
[42:57] from the time you're a young person
[42:58] growing up and you don't dress like
[43:00] everybody else you don't look like
[43:01] everybody else you don't live like
[43:02] everybody else
[43:04] you don't talk like everybody else and
[43:06] it becomes a trial at times in your life
[43:08] the word and and many times there's
[43:11] promises that you believe in
[43:12] see somebody don't believe in healing
[43:15] they don't have to worry about being
[43:16] healed
[43:17] they're not worried about whether god
[43:18] heals them or not because they don't
[43:20] believe in healing
[43:21] right if they would get healed they'd
[43:23] chalk it up to something else
[43:25] right but but a person who believes in
[43:27] healing believes it's for them
[43:30] and so you believe in healing i believe
[43:31] in healing and so healing is for me
[43:33] but yet many times healing is delayed
[43:37] and so the word itself tries us
[43:40] as we believe it because it doesn't
[43:42] happen right when we think it should
[43:44] happen
[43:45] and it doesn't happen when everybody
[43:46] else thinks it should happen
[43:48] but we know it's coming we know that
[43:50] it's there's something down the road
[43:52] that we can look to that that
[43:54] word is is something that's coming but
[43:56] yet we we just don't
[43:57] we we can't grab ahold of it right now
[43:59] and yet we say it's true
[44:02] and and you're you're sick in your body
[44:04] but you say i'm healed
[44:06] and you make mistakes but you say i'm
[44:08] saved
[44:11] but what is it there's a time that your
[44:14] word comes
[44:16] the promise is always being an irritant
[44:18] to israel to the nation of israel
[44:20] the promise was always inherited because
[44:23] you know
[44:23] to them it was like hey we're god's
[44:25] chosen people but i wish he would
[44:27] get to work because over the thousands
[44:30] of years through their own fault and
[44:31] through different things that would
[44:32] happen through our fault
[44:33] because god blinded them for our sakes
[44:36] that through thousands of years though
[44:38] they were god's elect they suffered more
[44:40] than any other group of people ever
[44:42] suffered but let me tell you what they
[44:44] also survived
[44:46] and it ought to be a testimony to us
[44:48] today that if you are the elect
[44:50] of god not only will you suffer but you
[44:52] will survive
[44:54] the suffering is not going to destroy
[44:56] you it's not going to take you down
[44:57] it's not going to eliminate you it's not
[44:59] going to take you out of
[45:00] out of god's gene pool so to speak and
[45:02] make you not a believer but the
[45:04] suffering
[45:05] just produces that life that that pearl
[45:07] that god wants in your life
[45:10] until the time that his word came the
[45:12] word of the lord tried him and so the
[45:13] promise itself
[45:15] and you can look at joseph's life and
[45:16] see that it was the dreams
[45:18] that he was given that actually made his
[45:20] brothers hate him
[45:23] right why did they hate him because
[45:26] the promise was given to him god chose
[45:30] him to do something
[45:31] and they hated him out of jealousy and
[45:34] that become the irritant in his life
[45:36] you believe god's elected you god chose
[45:38] you and it becomes an irritant but yet
[45:40] god's using that to produce something in
[45:42] your life
[45:43] a pearl big enough to make a gate out of
[45:48] now brother branham he said well could
[45:50] the word be that well
[45:53] when brother branham has that
[45:54] supernatural experience of standing in
[45:57] sabino canyon and a sword strikes his
[45:59] hand you know the story
[46:02] brother brown says if you don't
[46:04] understand spiritual things it may seem
[46:05] very strange
[46:06] but something struck my hand when i
[46:10] looked it was a sword
[46:12] and the handle was made of pearl
[46:15] the prettiest pearl i ever seen
[46:20] and what was the sword the word
[46:23] right it was a king's sword it was the
[46:24] word
[46:26] and it had formed a pearl handle
[46:29] oh my so it is the irritant that
[46:33] transforms the pearl
[46:35] into what it is and brother branham says
[46:38] this and power of transformation
[46:40] because that's the idea is that the
[46:42] pearl is being transformed by
[46:44] the response to the irritant and by the
[46:47] response of the seed to the word
[46:49] is what forms the character of your life
[46:53] and so in power of transformation
[46:55] brother branson said oh if we could only
[46:57] learn that that
[46:58] what part of the word we are we must
[47:01] take our place
[47:02] no matter what it is
[47:06] there's a place for us right it might be
[47:10] brother robert back there running the
[47:11] slides
[47:12] my boy he wants to play the drums so bad
[47:14] but he stuck back on the video
[47:16] but there's a place for you
[47:19] as a christian there's a place for you
[47:21] as a believer there's somewhere where
[47:23] you're supposed
[47:24] to be and we must take our place
[47:27] no matter what it is and brother branham
[47:31] takes this to
[47:32] a little woman that was in a wheelchair
[47:34] a sister in a wheelchair he said i think
[47:36] of a little sister here in the
[47:36] wheelchair
[47:37] sometimes how many faithful prayers has
[47:40] been made over it
[47:41] can you imagine what an irritant it must
[47:43] have been to her to be able to see
[47:45] supernatural miracles constantly across
[47:47] the platform
[47:48] and she went to the tabernacle and
[47:52] remained in a wheelchair
[47:56] and she had to see that over and over
[47:57] again and brother branham says
[47:59] then we don't understand he said so we
[48:01] just committed to god
[48:03] he said and she is a flower here among
[48:05] you
[48:06] with her pleasantness and everything
[48:09] he said see that we can get up and go
[48:12] around
[48:13] how she would long to do that but yet
[48:15] she is pleasant just the way she sits
[48:19] see the irritant does something to the
[48:21] elect that it doesn't do to the others
[48:24] you realize there's many kinds of shells
[48:27] that get irritants in them
[48:28] but it doesn't do to them what it does
[48:30] to certain shells
[48:32] because there's just a response a
[48:34] special response that they have
[48:36] to be able to form a pearl out of that
[48:39] and there's something about the believer
[48:40] that responds in a way
[48:42] that they don't turn out into some old
[48:43] cranky kind of person that
[48:45] can't get along with nobody and nobody's
[48:48] their friend and
[48:49] nobody loves them and all this but what
[48:50] does it make them do it makes them
[48:52] sweeter it makes them kinder
[48:54] it makes them more loving it makes them
[48:55] more like christ
[48:59] what is it the irritant i'm not the
[49:01] shell this is the shell
[49:03] right but the pearls on the inside hey
[49:06] man
[49:07] and as the pearl is it begins to be
[49:09] expressed something begins to take place
[49:11] with it as it transforms
[49:13] it even affects where when you open that
[49:15] up if that shell could ever get cracked
[49:17] open you can see
[49:18] there's something real on the inside now
[49:21] but she said she's pleasant just the way
[49:23] she sits he said i always get inspired
[49:26] to watch the little lady
[49:27] he said because she well he said we all
[49:29] believe in healing
[49:31] we've seen god do miracles far beyond
[49:33] that and she knows that too
[49:36] but she's willing to take her place
[49:39] see whatever it is that's what we want
[49:42] he said and i believe it was david said
[49:44] i'd rather be a doormat
[49:46] at the house of the lord than to dwell
[49:48] in tents with the wicked
[49:50] you see no matter what it is take my
[49:53] place
[49:56] you see sometimes brother brown says you
[49:58] have to separate from everything that's
[50:00] dear on earth to you
[50:01] to take your position that god has
[50:03] called you to
[50:04] he said i'm sure you can read between
[50:06] the lines what i'm saying
[50:08] sometimes the very dearest person on
[50:10] earth you have to shake hands with them
[50:12] and take your position in christ
[50:14] to where god has called you because god
[50:15] may not have called them to the same
[50:17] place
[50:18] we don't all serve in the same place we
[50:20] don't all belong in the same place
[50:21] so sometimes it breaks your heart you
[50:23] got to say bye to people you love
[50:26] because you're called to take a position
[50:28] in christ where god has called you
[50:31] what is god doing he said transforming
[50:33] you
[50:34] from what she was amen
[50:38] he said maybe a daughter or son or
[50:39] whatever it is from a lovely family
[50:41] sometimes he places you somewhere else
[50:43] because it's his way of doing it
[50:47] could i just testify that the word is
[50:49] true today
[50:51] and i know many are watching today and
[50:53] not able to be here but i
[50:54] i can testify that the word is true in
[50:56] my own life
[50:57] i've seen where god would take me from
[50:58] one place to another
[51:00] and i would find that as i do no maybe
[51:03] circumstances would happen and it just i
[51:05] would be removed from one place to
[51:06] another i would feel led
[51:08] to go to a different place than when i
[51:09] did it was always a hard
[51:11] time it was hard to leave those people
[51:13] it's hard to go away from them
[51:15] but i've watched through the years as
[51:18] you leave an influence in different
[51:19] parts and i'm not that old
[51:21] some of you can relate much more to this
[51:22] than i can but as you go different
[51:24] places you leave an influence behind you
[51:27] and when you leave that influence then
[51:29] it follows you
[51:30] even after you're dead the bible teaches
[51:33] your influence follows you but you
[51:35] as you go from place to place your
[51:37] influence follows you and i found
[51:39] that god has allowed me at this season
[51:41] my in my life
[51:43] when was the time i had to leave home
[51:44] and leave my mother and leave my family
[51:47] and god has allowed him to come back
[51:48] around me and be in church with me and
[51:51] there was a time
[51:52] i just testified that god's grace is
[51:53] good it was a time i had to leave a
[51:56] church because i felt led to go
[51:57] somewhere else
[51:58] and and god allowed those people to come
[52:00] right back in their elderly years
[52:02] to come right back and sit among us god
[52:05] does those i believe god's good don't
[52:07] you
[52:08] sometimes he has to move you somewhere
[52:09] else but he's just it's going to be
[52:11] better just trust him today church just
[52:13] trust him he knows what you need
[52:16] don't jump from pillar to post in place
[52:18] to place god knows exactly
[52:20] what you need to make that pearl out of
[52:21] your life
[52:23] i'm testifying that god's grace is good
[52:25] he can do it
[52:26] for you if he's done it if you put god
[52:28] first he will
[52:30] do that in your life amen
[52:33] some of you've been all around the world
[52:35] it seemed like but you ended up back
[52:36] here and already you don't know why
[52:38] but you're here today and you've you
[52:39] stuck it out through thick and thin
[52:41] and you've you've put up with problems
[52:42] and situations and everything else
[52:44] why are you still here because you found
[52:46] your position this is where you belong
[52:49] and because you belong here god will
[52:50] bless you with that
[52:53] now look
[52:56] he said it's god's way of doing it he
[52:59] said see by the renewing of your mind on
[53:01] your mind to obey the word of god
[53:04] regardless of what the price is
[53:08] now he gets down where he gets hard
[53:11] sometimes it hurts
[53:12] to do the right thing not just difficult
[53:17] he said our redemption wasn't a cheap
[53:19] thing
[53:20] it was the son of god had to die for us
[53:23] see things of value come of great price
[53:28] to bring this message he said it wasn't
[53:30] easy
[53:34] an irritant had to be placed in the
[53:35] shell to make it what it was
[53:38] you understand bring this message wasn't
[53:41] easy no it isn't he said i had to
[53:42] forsake everything that was dear to me
[53:44] even my own people everybody but you see
[53:47] the value of it is
[53:49] is to do the will of god
[53:53] and the prophecy was made over brother
[53:55] branham where they spoke about it and he
[53:57] said because you've chosen the harder
[53:59] way
[54:01] you've chosen the harder way you could
[54:03] have taken the easier road but you chose
[54:05] the harder way
[54:06] a great portion of heaven awaits you
[54:11] rare to find someone who will do the
[54:12] will of god
[54:14] who can find a virtuous woman where is
[54:17] that real wife and mother who teaches
[54:20] their children the things of god
[54:22] i'll take that on a spiritual side where
[54:24] is there a church with any
[54:25] strength in it just stand for the word
[54:27] of god
[54:29] oh i believe once we find it we we ought
[54:32] to not give it up
[54:37] you see the virtuous woman not only is
[54:39] she rare is she scarce
[54:41] her value is in that but her value is in
[54:42] that she can be trusted
[54:44] proverbs 31 11 the heart of her husband
[54:47] does safely trust in her
[54:49] so that he shall have no need of spoil
[54:52] she will do him good and not evil all
[54:55] the days of her life
[54:57] he doesn't have to constantly check his
[54:59] bank account
[55:00] to see if she's bankrupted him
[55:05] right and you're taking the literal
[55:06] meaning of the work of the verses
[55:09] in today's language
[55:12] she she doesn't max out all the credit
[55:14] cards on amazon
[55:17] because she knows the money's not there
[55:19] right if it's there
[55:21] you know spend it but
[55:25] but if the money's not there she don't
[55:27] do that she'll do him good and not evil
[55:29] he can trust her that if what she does
[55:33] see she doesn't just take value
[55:36] but she adds value look for friends
[55:40] and especially a spouse that will add
[55:43] value to your life
[55:46] take it away right if if somebody
[55:50] if you're around somebody just
[55:50] constantly complaining just complaining
[55:52] complaining complaining
[55:54] they're they're discontented with every
[55:55] situation they're in they'll never add
[55:57] value to your life
[55:59] but if you can ever get around somebody
[56:00] who just loves people and loves god and
[56:03] and is happy if they don't have nothing
[56:05] but they're happy to be there
[56:07] listen that's the person that that can
[56:09] add value to
[56:10] your life even if they're not wealthy
[56:12] they add a value because
[56:14] it adds positivity to your life which is
[56:16] worth something today
[56:18] and so we could take this again on the
[56:21] spiritual side and say that the bride
[56:22] will not do him evil
[56:25] the bride will do good for him not evil
[56:28] all the days of
[56:29] of the his life all the days of uh that
[56:32] we're with christ we do him good
[56:34] look here's the secret brother brahman
[56:36] says the word is in the bride
[56:38] and the mind of christ to know what he
[56:40] wants done with the word
[56:42] so she takes his resources which is his
[56:44] word
[56:45] right that's his his word it comes from
[56:47] his his inner
[56:49] being of who he is and that is his
[56:51] resource
[56:52] of what he has the value of god is in
[56:55] himself
[56:56] it's not in what he owns or what he has
[56:58] or even what he creates but it's in
[57:00] himself
[57:01] right all those attributes come from god
[57:04] and and that's his value and she doesn't
[57:06] waste his resources
[57:09] right the bride doesn't waste his
[57:11] resources but she knows
[57:12] what he wants done with the word and she
[57:16] does it in his name
[57:17] and she has thus saith the lord
[57:21] so he trusts her to remain true to him
[57:25] amen now so
[57:28] it has value and the virtuous woman also
[57:31] adds value to her family by her works
[57:33] and we'll go through this more quickly
[57:35] but she doesn't work to gain his favor
[57:38] she works because she's a virtuous woman
[57:39] brother brandon taught that faith and
[57:41] works were married
[57:42] they're married if you see one there'll
[57:44] be the other proverbs 31 13 says she
[57:47] seeketh wool and flax
[57:49] and worketh willingly with her hands she
[57:51] is like the merchant ships she bringeth
[57:53] her food from afar
[57:55] she rises also while it is yet night
[57:57] giveth meat to her household
[57:59] and a portion to her maidens and some of
[58:02] you ladies can say i identify with all
[58:03] this
[58:05] sounds like a servant sounds almost like
[58:09] a slave
[58:10] but watch the virtuous woman is not a
[58:12] servant
[58:13] and she's not a slave because the bible
[58:16] also says she considers a field
[58:18] and buys it with the fruit of her hands
[58:21] she planted a vineyard she's not a slave
[58:24] she's a say a business owner
[58:28] right and her business is her family
[58:32] and i've told you i know some women have
[58:34] to work just the day and age that we
[58:35] live in i understand that
[58:37] but if you have to work you've got two
[58:38] jobs
[58:40] right and your first job's always your
[58:42] family that's your first job
[58:45] and it's taking care of your family and
[58:46] so she considers a field and buys it
[58:49] because she's adding value
[58:52] to even what she's required to do right
[58:55] and and now she
[58:56] she plants a vineyard she girdeth her
[58:58] loins with strength and strength
[58:59] strengthens her arms she perceives that
[59:02] her merchandise is good her candle goes
[59:04] not out by night
[59:05] she layeth her hands to the spindle and
[59:08] her hands hold the disc staff
[59:10] she's constantly adding value to her
[59:12] household i don't think it should be
[59:13] just mothers like this or
[59:15] we thank god that they are but it should
[59:16] be all of us
[59:18] right not to be a negative to our house
[59:20] when we walk in it shouldn't be a
[59:21] negative
[59:22] it shouldn't be that you know if you are
[59:24] married and every time you come home
[59:26] it creates a negative atmosphere in the
[59:28] home you probably won't have that for
[59:30] long
[59:32] right because people get tired of living
[59:33] like that
[59:35] right you don't want to be a negative
[59:38] you want to add some value
[59:39] somehow to your home add some value to
[59:42] your church
[59:43] be a part and do everybody can't you
[59:45] know i realized that
[59:46] i used to show up at work days at the
[59:48] church i went to and i realized that i
[59:50] couldn't do much
[59:51] and so for years they had me working
[59:53] getting the birds out of the top of the
[59:55] thing because they knew i didn't like
[59:56] ladders so some of the trustees figured
[59:59] that out and they put me way up in the
[1:00:01] top of the building
[1:00:02] getting birds nests on a big long ladder
[1:00:04] and i hate ladders i climb them real
[1:00:06] slow and and they put me up there you
[1:00:09] know knowing that and
[1:00:10] but i did it you know and i because
[1:00:12] there wasn't a whole lot else i can do
[1:00:13] i'm not very
[1:00:14] handy i talk i don't do so much with
[1:00:16] this
[1:00:17] you know but even the working my job was
[1:00:20] it was
[1:00:21] in the legal field i didn't and and
[1:00:23] selling and buying houses and things
[1:00:25] like that and doing closings i never did
[1:00:27] i did paperwork
[1:00:28] i never did much work with my actual
[1:00:31] hands in that way
[1:00:32] i'm willing to work but you got to show
[1:00:34] me what to do
[1:00:35] right and if i want to build something
[1:00:37] it's going to it's not going to turn out
[1:00:38] it's going to turn out about like that
[1:00:40] that plato baby that my mom made the
[1:00:42] other day but
[1:00:44] it's it's gonna you know it's not gonna
[1:00:45] look very good
[1:00:48] but but you you can do something
[1:00:51] right you being there can add value
[1:00:54] even if they're you think well i can't
[1:00:55] do much so but you being there can add
[1:00:58] value you can do something
[1:01:00] see this is what sarah misunderstood in
[1:01:03] the promise to abraham
[1:01:04] sarah thought this is abraham's promise
[1:01:07] but this was
[1:01:08] not just abraham's promise because sarah
[1:01:10] was a part of him
[1:01:12] and so she misunderstood that and gave
[1:01:14] him hagar and caused ishmael to be born
[1:01:16] and causes trouble to this day because
[1:01:18] she brother branham called it a slightly
[1:01:20] doubted promise the seed of a slightly
[1:01:22] doubted promise what is it it's a
[1:01:24] misunderstanding
[1:01:25] of her part to play in the whole thing
[1:01:28] but
[1:01:28] god later reveals he comes to abraham
[1:01:30] and he says sarah
[1:01:32] your wife will have a son amen
[1:01:35] it won't just be ishmael but it'll be
[1:01:37] her wife that'll have a part
[1:01:39] in that and brother branham talks about
[1:01:41] that when it comes to mankind and
[1:01:43] he said brother jason i were talking
[1:01:44] about this yesterday he said that's the
[1:01:46] reason
[1:01:46] that god does nothing outside of a man
[1:01:48] he always works through a man because he
[1:01:50] had to use
[1:01:51] man a man is what he had to use to
[1:01:53] display his attribute of savior
[1:01:55] he had to make him in his image make him
[1:01:57] something like him put him on free moral
[1:01:59] agency let him act any way he wanted to
[1:02:01] he could take his choice and he knew
[1:02:03] that man by giving him this choice would
[1:02:04] fall
[1:02:05] so being that he had to do that he turns
[1:02:07] back around and makes the man a partner
[1:02:10] to him
[1:02:11] and does nothing except he does it
[1:02:12] through a man
[1:02:15] amen he said well i see different things
[1:02:18] for that but what i see is grace
[1:02:20] that god will use a man
[1:02:24] and he used that man jesus christ but he
[1:02:26] uses us now look
[1:02:27] proverbs 31 and 20 she stretcheth out
[1:02:30] her hand to the poor yes she reacheth
[1:02:32] forth her hands to the needy
[1:02:34] she's not afraid of the snow for her
[1:02:36] household for all her householder
[1:02:37] clothes with scarlet
[1:02:38] she makes herself coverings of tapestry
[1:02:41] her clothing is silk and purple
[1:02:43] her husband is known in the gates when
[1:02:46] he sitteth among the elders of the land
[1:02:50] we don't want to get too far into that
[1:02:54] i don't endorse necessarily husbands
[1:02:56] sitting while their wives work
[1:03:00] but what it means is that when he takes
[1:03:02] his place
[1:03:03] among the elders he's known
[1:03:06] because of his wife
[1:03:10] because a virtuous bride works to make
[1:03:13] her bridegroom famous
[1:03:16] something brother stewart said the other
[1:03:18] night really struck me he said people
[1:03:20] just want to have the biggest meeting or
[1:03:21] the biggest church and it really struck
[1:03:23] me i said god i want my motives to be
[1:03:24] right
[1:03:25] i don't want to just have the biggest
[1:03:27] meeting i don't want to have the biggest
[1:03:28] church
[1:03:28] i want to i want to make my husband if
[1:03:31] you could say it that way i want to make
[1:03:32] christ
[1:03:33] famous that should be every one of us
[1:03:38] we should want to make him famous said
[1:03:40] that wherever we go
[1:03:41] he is known right isn't that what our
[1:03:44] prophet did
[1:03:45] he didn't make his own name famous what
[1:03:46] did he do he made christ
[1:03:48] famous amen for being a healer of the
[1:03:51] sick
[1:03:52] for being a savior for being one who
[1:03:54] could reveal the secrets of the heart he
[1:03:55] made christ
[1:03:56] famous what should we do today make him
[1:03:58] famous
[1:03:59] amen make him famous in our own home
[1:04:01] when we sit down with the children make
[1:04:03] christ famous
[1:04:04] by the way that we act by the way that
[1:04:06] we do but the way we treat others
[1:04:09] amen make him famous
[1:04:12] hallelujah she doesn't seek the glory
[1:04:15] she gives it all to him
[1:04:16] verse 24 she make it final in and
[1:04:18] encelaeth it delivereth girls under the
[1:04:20] merchant strength and honor
[1:04:22] or her clothing she shall rejoice in
[1:04:24] time
[1:04:25] to come she realizes it's not all in
[1:04:28] this life her reward is eternal
[1:04:32] but she is not a silent partner
[1:04:35] and i want you to watch this the
[1:04:37] virtuous woman is not a silent partner
[1:04:41] sarah called abraham lord but she was
[1:04:43] not silent
[1:04:46] far from it
[1:04:51] now the bible in verse 26 says she
[1:04:54] openeth her mouth
[1:04:56] with wisdom and then her tongue is the
[1:04:59] law of kindness this
[1:05:00] is part of her value is in speaking
[1:05:05] right speaking now that's not making her
[1:05:08] the pastor of a church or something like
[1:05:09] that
[1:05:10] but it's speaking and adding value to
[1:05:13] her household by the words
[1:05:15] that she says now
[1:05:19] a mother's voice is the first thing a
[1:05:20] child will recognize when they're
[1:05:22] just even in the womb that's what they
[1:05:25] hear first
[1:05:27] mother talks to her children and i want
[1:05:30] to challenge you today if you're a
[1:05:31] mother
[1:05:32] or as a christian what does your voice
[1:05:35] say
[1:05:37] now think about this for a moment again
[1:05:38] i i won't hold you very much longer but
[1:05:41] what will your voice say because the
[1:05:43] wrong kind of voice
[1:05:45] will make a child turn against god
[1:05:50] it's true it'll make him turn against
[1:05:53] the ministry
[1:05:54] against the prophet or her turn against
[1:05:57] the ministry the prophet and ultimately
[1:05:59] god himself i get that from the
[1:06:02] scripture
[1:06:03] you remember the herodias was herod's
[1:06:05] wife
[1:06:07] and john the baptist said it's not
[1:06:08] lawful for you to have her
[1:06:10] you remember she's kind of a famous
[1:06:12] woman for being evil
[1:06:14] in the bible she taught her daughter how
[1:06:16] to dress how to dance
[1:06:18] how to attract the attention of men when
[1:06:20] a mother ought to teach your children
[1:06:22] the opposite
[1:06:24] right why would you want your child to
[1:06:27] attract the attention of a man
[1:06:28] especially when they're 10 12 years old
[1:06:32] why would a mother do that it's not
[1:06:34] right and you've seen it but
[1:06:37] we won't dwell on that but that's what
[1:06:38] she did and her daughter finally
[1:06:40] attracted the attention of her own
[1:06:42] stepfather
[1:06:44] and she asked her mother what to do
[1:06:46] about it
[1:06:48] how can i take advantage of this
[1:06:51] and her mother instead of giving her a
[1:06:54] good spanking
[1:06:57] tells her she says what shall i ask and
[1:06:59] she said the head of john the baptist
[1:07:03] so her voice was used to encourage her
[1:07:06] daughter
[1:07:06] to murder a prophet
[1:07:11] now think about this what does your
[1:07:14] voice say to your children
[1:07:16] is it is it using your voice to
[1:07:19] encourage the murder of a preacher
[1:07:22] i don't know that that's going on
[1:07:23] anywhere but just think about that
[1:07:25] want to be using your voice to encourage
[1:07:28] the murder of a prophet
[1:07:31] you can't really believe what he has to
[1:07:33] say or is it is she using her voice for
[1:07:35] something else
[1:07:36] now brother brandon tells us that 70 of
[1:07:38] her children and grandchildren ended up
[1:07:40] either in prostitution
[1:07:41] or in the gallows 70 of them
[1:07:45] but there was a woman that was in mark
[1:07:47] chapter 6 where we read about that mark
[1:07:48] chapter 7
[1:07:50] speaks of another woman the sour
[1:07:52] phoenician woman
[1:07:54] who spoke something different and she
[1:07:57] had a young daughter who had an unclean
[1:07:58] spirit she heard about jesus and came
[1:08:01] and fell at his feet
[1:08:03] and the woman was a greek a
[1:08:04] syrophoenician by nation
[1:08:06] and she besought him and he would cast
[1:08:08] forth the devil out of her daughter
[1:08:10] but jesus said unto her let the children
[1:08:13] first be
[1:08:14] filled it is not meat to take the
[1:08:16] children's bread
[1:08:17] and to cast it under the dogs he was
[1:08:18] only going to the lost sheep of the
[1:08:20] house of israel
[1:08:21] at that time he said it's not me for me
[1:08:23] to do that
[1:08:24] it's not right for me to take the
[1:08:25] children's bread to cast it to the dogs
[1:08:28] and she answered and said to him yes
[1:08:29] lord
[1:08:32] watch what her voice was used for it was
[1:08:35] to say amen
[1:08:37] yes sword oh that's the best thing we
[1:08:39] could say about him
[1:08:40] yes lord i believe that what you're
[1:08:43] saying is true
[1:08:44] even if it hurts me even if it if it
[1:08:46] makes me feel bad
[1:08:47] even if i realize i'm not doing
[1:08:49] everything right yes sword
[1:08:51] yes lord i believe your word is true yes
[1:08:54] sword
[1:08:55] i want my kids to serve god even if i
[1:08:58] maybe i have a personal
[1:08:59] issue with the preacher or with somebody
[1:09:01] else in the church or something but i
[1:09:02] won't quit why
[1:09:03] i want my voice to my children to be yes
[1:09:06] lord
[1:09:10] yes sword amen
[1:09:13] and she said yes sword yes the dogs she
[1:09:16] wasn't afraid to speak for what she had
[1:09:18] a need
[1:09:19] of yet the dogs under the table eat of
[1:09:21] the children's crumbs
[1:09:23] and he saith unto her for this saying go
[1:09:24] thy way for this saying go that way
[1:09:27] for the saying of herodias her family
[1:09:30] ended up destituting and
[1:09:31] and despairing on the gallows but for
[1:09:34] the saying of the sour phoenician woman
[1:09:36] her daughter was healed hallelujah
[1:09:39] the bible said when she was come to her
[1:09:40] house she found the devil going out and
[1:09:42] her daughter laid on the bed
[1:09:46] don't make the bright speech of no value
[1:09:49] i'll read part of this and and i'm sorry
[1:09:51] brother robert we'll skip through this
[1:09:52] because i'm out of time
[1:09:55] but in the laodicean church age brother
[1:09:56] branham talks about how the prophet
[1:09:58] would be god's mouthpiece
[1:10:00] as it's declared in malachi 4. and he
[1:10:04] says
[1:10:05] he will restore the truth as they had it
[1:10:07] in that next quote and
[1:10:09] and he said and those elect with him in
[1:10:11] that day will be the ones
[1:10:12] who truly manifest the lord and be his
[1:10:15] body
[1:10:16] and be his voice and perform his works
[1:10:22] huh she's not a silent partner but she
[1:10:25] don't speak unless he speaks
[1:10:28] right he said he talks about church
[1:10:32] history and how the lutheran spoke for
[1:10:33] god at one time
[1:10:35] and about the wesleyans and how that
[1:10:36] they spoke for god at one time
[1:10:39] he said and when the methodist failed
[1:10:41] god raised up others
[1:10:43] and so it has gone on through the years
[1:10:45] until in this last day
[1:10:47] there is again another people in the
[1:10:49] land
[1:10:50] amen under their messenger will be the
[1:10:53] final voice
[1:10:54] to the final age he said yes sir
[1:10:58] the church is no longer the mouthpiece
[1:10:59] of god is it is its own mouthpiece
[1:11:01] so god is turning on her he will
[1:11:03] confound her through the prophet and the
[1:11:05] bride
[1:11:06] for the voice of god will be in her he
[1:11:08] said yes it is for it says in the last
[1:11:10] chapter of revelation verse 17
[1:11:11] the spirit and the bride say come
[1:11:14] once more the world will hear direct
[1:11:16] from god
[1:11:19] think about that the world
[1:11:23] will hear direct from god when the bride
[1:11:25] speaks
[1:11:27] because they're saying what the
[1:11:28] messenger said and he said what god
[1:11:31] said amen
[1:11:35] it's not that they don't speak they do
[1:11:36] speak and the world hears direct from
[1:11:38] god like they did at pentecost
[1:11:41] but of course the word bride will be
[1:11:43] repudiated
[1:11:44] as in the first stage the world won't
[1:11:46] accept it but they'll hear it
[1:11:49] she has value in her speech proverbs 31
[1:11:51] 27 she looks well to the ways of her
[1:11:53] household
[1:11:54] edith not the bread of idleness verse 28
[1:11:56] her children rise up
[1:11:58] call her blessed and her husband also
[1:11:59] and he praiseth her
[1:12:01] verse 29 many daughters have done
[1:12:02] virtuously but alex thou
[1:12:04] excelis them all verse 30 favor is
[1:12:07] deceitful
[1:12:08] beauty is vain a cultured pearl can have
[1:12:10] beauty
[1:12:11] a woman that feareth the lord she shall
[1:12:13] be praised
[1:12:14] give her the fruit of her hands let her
[1:12:17] own works praise her in the gates
[1:12:21] what does god have to say about that
[1:12:22] kind of a bride musicians go ahead and
[1:12:24] come
[1:12:26] what does he have to say how does god
[1:12:28] value because that's ultimately the test
[1:12:29] of value
[1:12:31] because people are willing to pay large
[1:12:34] amounts of things that you know someone
[1:12:36] i think paid over a million dollars for
[1:12:38] one of those suits that elvis wore
[1:12:41] i'll be honest with you i don't want one
[1:12:44] especially if it hasn't been washed
[1:12:46] since he wore it
[1:12:49] i just no desire to have one of those
[1:12:51] suits and pay millions of dollars so
[1:12:53] beauty's in the eye of the beholder and
[1:12:54] there's got to be value in in
[1:12:58] in the eye of a person who knows what
[1:13:00] he's doing
[1:13:02] right not just any old guy but somebody
[1:13:05] who knows value
[1:13:07] he knows value how does he
[1:13:10] value the bride as we close this morning
[1:13:13] on this mother's day how does god value
[1:13:16] the bride
[1:13:17] she's a pearl of great price he gave up
[1:13:21] all of heaven
[1:13:22] when he found the pearl to purchase her
[1:13:27] amen zephaniah 3 and 16
[1:13:31] speaks of the way god thinks and think
[1:13:33] about it puts it in human terms but just
[1:13:35] so you get it
[1:13:36] zephaniah 3 and 16 how he thinks about
[1:13:38] jerusalem or zion
[1:13:39] which is a type of the bride he said in
[1:13:41] that day it shall be said to jerusalem
[1:13:42] fear thou not
[1:13:43] and desire let not thy hands to be
[1:13:45] sacked the lord thy god in the midst of
[1:13:48] thee is mighty
[1:13:49] he will save he will rejoice over thee
[1:13:52] with joy
[1:13:53] he will rest in his love he will joy
[1:13:56] over thee with singing have you ever
[1:13:57] thought about that what does god
[1:13:59] sing about if god's saying what would he
[1:14:03] sing about
[1:14:06] you sing about god what would god sing
[1:14:09] about
[1:14:12] you it says he will rest in his love
[1:14:15] he will joy over there he was singing
[1:14:17] that word joy if you go back in the
[1:14:19] original
[1:14:19] is literally he spins around
[1:14:22] which is the kind of dance that they
[1:14:24] would have done in that day and the
[1:14:25] people would have understood
[1:14:26] that god was dancing and singing
[1:14:34] how much do you value your wife
[1:14:41] sometimes she's just so beautiful the
[1:14:44] mother of your children so beautiful
[1:14:46] that you want to just dance and sing
[1:14:49] maybe you better not but
[1:14:52] may not be something she'd value very
[1:14:54] much
[1:14:58] but he said i will rejoice over you
[1:15:01] with joy it just makes me want to move
[1:15:08] hallelujah oh i don't believe in dancing
[1:15:11] in the church well
[1:15:14] there it is
[1:15:19] this virtuous bride is so valuable that
[1:15:22] the bridegroom
[1:15:23] when she comes to her proper place and i
[1:15:25] believe this is the hour for that
[1:15:27] he dances and sings in her presence
[1:15:33] what should you do what kind of an
[1:15:34] outlook should you have hebrews 12 and 1
[1:15:36] wherefore seeing
[1:15:37] we also are compassed about with so
[1:15:39] great a cloud of witnesses
[1:15:40] let us lay aside every way and the sin
[1:15:43] which just so easily beset us
[1:15:45] let us run with patience the race that
[1:15:46] is set before us looking unto jesus
[1:15:49] the author and finisher of our faith who
[1:15:52] for the joy
[1:15:53] that was set before him because he was
[1:15:55] so looking forward to that
[1:15:57] to having that moment when he could sing
[1:16:00] over his bride
[1:16:02] he despised the shame endured the cross
[1:16:05] and is set down at the right hand of the
[1:16:07] throne of god
[1:16:09] could we bow our heads together
[1:16:13] either here this morning you that are
[1:16:14] watching
[1:16:18] do you realize what kind of value he's
[1:16:20] placed in you today
[1:16:23] you are so valuable that he's
[1:16:26] the bible says he bowed the heavens he
[1:16:28] bent
[1:16:30] he stretched himself into a body of
[1:16:34] flesh he came down
[1:16:36] into a baby in a manger lived and died
[1:16:40] and was crucified and
[1:16:42] rose again on the third day the death
[1:16:44] burial and resurrection of christ
[1:16:48] so that he thought so much of you so
[1:16:50] that you could be saved
[1:16:52] what do you think of him today do you
[1:16:54] value him do you
[1:16:56] look forward to that joy if he would
[1:16:57] dance and sing if you would come to him
[1:16:59] today
[1:17:01] would you have joy in his presence
[1:17:04] i believe there's joy when you realize
[1:17:07] he's there
[1:17:09] maybe you've never given your heart to
[1:17:10] christ you'd like to do that this
[1:17:11] morning now's the time
[1:17:14] maybe you're a christian today that
