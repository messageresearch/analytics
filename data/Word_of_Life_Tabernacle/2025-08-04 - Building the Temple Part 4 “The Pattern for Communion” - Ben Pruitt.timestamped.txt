[39:13] read the rest of it a little bit later.
[39:15] Paul says, "For I have received of the
[39:17] Lord that which also delivered I unto
[39:21] you, that the Lord Jesus the same night
[39:23] in which he was betrayed took bread."
[39:26] Pray the Lord would add his blessing to
[39:28] the word. You may be seated.
[39:31] Paul does not say I heard from someone
[39:33] who was there.
[39:35] He doesn't say somebody told somebody
[39:37] who told somebody else who told somebody
[39:40] else that and it was handed down to me
[39:42] that this is the way we should do
[39:44] communion. But Paul says I received of
[39:47] the Lord,
[39:49] &gt;&gt; right? What I delivered unto you. I love
[39:52] the assurance of that. He he he was not
[39:55] there. Paul was not there when they took
[39:57] communion. He was not one of the
[39:59] apostles that sat with Jesus that night
[40:01] and and took communion with him. But he
[40:04] was one who received from God. He was an
[40:07] apostle of God, a prophet of God, the
[40:10] first church age messenger. And he said,
[40:12] "What I received, I received from the
[40:14] Lord." So that is the pattern we were
[40:16] talking about this morning for communion
[40:18] is actually what God showed the vision
[40:22] revelation that God showed Paul in the
[40:24] word. This is how that it's supposed to
[40:26] be done. And I know I preach a lot on
[40:29] communion when we have communion. It
[40:31] seems like we have it a lot. We have it
[40:33] maybe four or five times a year. Uh just
[40:35] the way that it falls. But but I believe
[40:37] it's important because in the pattern in
[40:40] the first church they had the communion.
[40:43] So if that detail was there in that
[40:46] first church, that detail ought to be
[40:48] there in the last church, just like the
[40:50] candlestick we talked about this
[40:51] morning, it had a certain detail in it
[40:54] that he saw in the vision. And he wanted
[40:56] that detail to be there. Every little
[40:59] flower, every the the even the weight of
[41:01] the gold and the weight of the
[41:02] candlestick. And if God wanted it to be
[41:04] there in the first church age, he wants
[41:06] it to be there in the last church age.
[41:09] And so we find that communion uh was a
[41:12] special time for that early church. Now,
[41:14] it wasn't long after Paul that Satan
[41:17] took communion and he made it something
[41:19] that it wasn't. I believe that Satan saw
[41:21] the value of communion because there's a
[41:24] great value not in the in the bread
[41:26] itself or in the wine itself, but in the
[41:29] remembering of the Lord in recognizing
[41:31] what he did for us. How many are happy
[41:33] that he died for you? Are you grateful
[41:35] that he forgave your sins? I I think if
[41:38] you ever recognize that you were a
[41:39] sinner, then there's a gratefulness that
[41:41] comes on you that you know, Lord, I'm so
[41:44] thankful that you died for my sins. I'm
[41:46] so thankful that you brought me out. I'm
[41:48] so thankful. I'm so glad to be able to
[41:51] take communion with my brothers and
[41:53] sisters. I I'm happy to be able to have
[41:55] this fellowship. And and so Satan saw
[41:58] the value of that. And immediately he
[42:00] turned communion into something it
[42:01] wasn't. and he begin to make communion
[42:04] actually salvation which we know there's
[42:06] no salvation in communion itself.
[42:10] &gt;&gt; So he looks at the pattern of God and
[42:12] tries to mimic it but it's not the same.
[42:16] &gt;&gt; Right?
[42:17] &gt;&gt; So brother Brandon says the devil has a
[42:19] pattern of everything God has real.
[42:23] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[42:23] &gt;&gt; We've been talking about the pattern.
[42:24] The devil has a pattern of everything
[42:27] God has real. So the devil looks at what
[42:29] God does. He can't see into the mind of
[42:32] God. When he sees God do something, he
[42:35] tries to pattern that. And so what what
[42:38] does he do? Brother said, "Babylon was
[42:40] made a pattern of heaven."
[42:42] &gt;&gt; He said, "Oh, the natural." He said,
[42:44] "Just exactly. There's a real genuine
[42:46] Christian filled with the Holy Ghost.
[42:48] There's a whole lot of hypocrites that
[42:50] act just like it." He said, "But the
[42:52] hypocrite only declares the real person
[42:55] to stand out bright and shiny, doesn't
[42:57] it?" He said all the false and bogus
[42:59] things only declare the real. So we
[43:01] should not not go to church or not
[43:03] assemble ourselves because of
[43:05] hypocrites. Hypocrites are always going
[43:06] to be there. But the hypocrite only
[43:08] declares the real to stand out bright
[43:11] and shiny. It just makes you stand out
[43:13] that much more.
[43:15] &gt;&gt; So brother Brandham again talked about
[43:16] Babylon. He said Babylon the very city
[43:19] was patterned out of heaven. You ever
[43:21] think you ever think about that? Babylon
[43:23] was patterned out of heaven. In Babylon,
[43:25] they had the river Euphrates flowing
[43:27] right by the throne and the garden, the
[43:29] swing garden, the hanging gardens of
[43:31] Babylon that had them there. He said
[43:33] that's patterned off of heaven, the
[43:35] river of life. See, they tried to
[43:36] recreate an Eden in the desert.
[43:39] &gt;&gt; Right. They tried to do what God had
[43:41] done, what God was going to do. In fact,
[43:43] they tried to do it before. They even
[43:45] tried to build a tower to reach to the
[43:47] heavens and God brought confusion on it.
[43:49] Yes, sir.
[43:50] &gt;&gt; But it was that Babylonian system. And
[43:52] so he said that's patterned off of
[43:54] heaven for the river of life flows by
[43:55] the throne of God. He said and you see
[43:57] the achievement that man was doing was
[44:00] making a pattern perverted. So Babylon
[44:03] is perverted heaven. Mystery Babylon,
[44:06] the Catholic Church is the perverted
[44:08] bride,
[44:10] &gt;&gt; right? It's Satan's perversion of a of a
[44:12] bride. So Catholicism takes the pattern
[44:15] that Paul had set forth and what Paul
[44:17] had received of the Lord and they they
[44:20] changed it and made the bread and the
[44:21] wine literally the body and blood in the
[44:24] council of Trent. uh the Catholics say
[44:26] by the consecration of the bread and of
[44:28] the wine, a conversion is made of the
[44:30] whole substance of the bread into the
[44:32] substance of the body of Christ our
[44:33] Lord, of the whole substance of the wine
[44:36] into the substance of his blood, which
[44:38] conversion is by the holy Catholic
[44:40] Church suitably and properly called
[44:42] transsubstantiation.
[44:44] And so when you they they believe it's
[44:46] literally the body and blood of the
[44:47] Lord. Now, where did they get that from?
[44:48] Not from the scripture, but they
[44:50] actually added that to what Paul taught,
[44:52] &gt;&gt; right?
[44:54] So Paul in the beginning, let's look how
[44:56] Paul patterned communion. Paul used
[44:58] unleavened bread. In fact, even in the
[45:00] type of it in 1 Corinthians 5'8, he
[45:02] said, "Therefore, let us keep the feast
[45:04] not with old leaven, neither with the
[45:06] leavenven of malice and wickedness, but
[45:07] with the unleavened bread of sincerity
[45:09] and of truth." And of course, they used
[45:11] unleavened bread in the Passover.
[45:12] Unleaven bread was meant to be used for
[45:15] communion. The bread was to be broken.
[45:17] It was not to remain a whole piece, but
[45:19] it was to be broken. In 1 Corinthians
[45:21] 11:24, it says, "When he had given
[45:23] thanks, he broke it and said, "Take,
[45:25] eat. This is my body which is broken for
[45:27] you. This do in remembrance of me."
[45:30] Catholic dogma took that and changed it
[45:32] out of convenience into an unbroken
[45:35] round wafer. You realize they did it out
[45:37] of convenience.
[45:39] The story, the Catholics have a story,
[45:41] they have lots of stories, but there was
[45:43] a monk supposedly hundreds of years ago
[45:46] who was had committed himself to not
[45:49] building a fire. So, he was not going to
[45:51] warm himself. I'm so thankful we don't
[45:53] have to live like that cuz I like a fire
[45:55] when it's cold. But this monk had had
[45:58] that was his way of abusing his flesh.
[46:00] And we talked about that this morning.
[46:02] Uh will worship,
[46:04] &gt;&gt; right? Where you just decide you're
[46:05] going to do something for God. We don't
[46:06] decide what we do for God. He tells us
[46:08] what to do,
[46:10] &gt;&gt; right? But but he they he was abusing
[46:12] his flesh and in that way he said, "I
[46:14] won't even warm myself." And but his
[46:17] responsibility was to make the communion
[46:19] bread. And so he said, "Well, how am I
[46:21] going to do this?" And so he got a pair
[46:23] of long tongs and that would reach a
[46:26] long distance where he wouldn't get too
[46:28] warm. H because that's what legalism
[46:30] does to you is it makes you do all kinds
[46:32] of odd things,
[46:33] &gt;&gt; right? And and so he's got these long
[46:35] tongs and he reaches into the fire with
[46:38] and and what it does is it created a
[46:40] very crispy light bread and it was in
[46:43] and supposedly it came out in the shape
[46:45] of a wafer and so originally it was a
[46:47] bigger wafer and eventually they out of
[46:49] convenience it come down to a personal
[46:51] size. So, if you go into a Catholic
[46:53] church today, you would kneel down at
[46:55] the altar and the priest would come and
[46:57] you would take communion and the priest
[46:59] would come and he would uh either put
[47:01] the a wafer on your tongue or stick out
[47:03] your tongue, you put a wafer on it or he
[47:06] would you would hand he would hand it to
[47:07] you and you could eat it. So, it would
[47:09] be a single serving. It's never broken.
[47:11] It's made that way.
[47:13] &gt;&gt; But they broke the pattern of God in
[47:15] doing that.
[47:16] &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, how is that important?"
[47:18] It's important because communion is just
[47:20] a symbol, but it's an important symbol.
[47:23] &gt;&gt; It's a whole body being broken
[47:26] &gt;&gt; into peace. Oh church, we're not all the
[47:28] body of God, but we're a part of the
[47:30] body of Christ. And every one of us as
[47:32] we take communion, as we partake of the
[47:34] bread, what are we doing? We're
[47:36] fulfilling our part.
[47:39] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon said there's no round
[47:41] bread on a Christian table.
[47:44] &gt;&gt; It was a pagan thing. So they actually
[47:47] introduced elements of pagan worship.
[47:49] Now they won't admit this but in
[47:51] Jeremiah 7:1 17 he talked about how that
[47:55] uh he said seeest thou not what they do
[47:57] in the cities of Judah in the streets of
[47:58] Jerusalem. The children gather wood and
[48:00] the fathers kindle the fire. The women
[48:02] need their dough to make cakes to the
[48:05] queen of heaven to pour out drink
[48:07] offerings unto other gods that they may
[48:09] provoke me to anger. That Babylonian
[48:11] religion had come down all the way down
[48:13] to the Romans. So the Romans were
[48:15] interesting people because they didn't
[48:16] care what god you worshiped as long as
[48:18] you was willing to worship the emperor.
[48:20] &gt;&gt; So you you could worship as many gods as
[48:22] you wanted to. They had all kinds of
[48:24] gods,
[48:25] &gt;&gt; but they also wanted you to worship the
[48:26] emperor. They made him a god.
[48:28] &gt;&gt; And so they didn't care that all the
[48:30] only ones the pagans had a problem with
[48:32] was like the Jews and the Christians
[48:34] because they would only worship one god.
[48:36] They said as long as you worship Jesus
[48:38] and all these other gods, you'll be
[48:39] okay. And that's what the Catholic
[48:41] Church became was a merging of that
[48:43] Roman system with Christianity. And so,
[48:47] Brother Brandon taught us this. He said
[48:49] because Baal was the son god. He said
[48:51] the cakes was made. And Jeremiah said
[48:54] the women had made cakes to Baal, the
[48:55] son god. He said later on in the
[48:57] chapter, if you read it, they said if we
[48:59] don't worship Baal, then our crops will
[49:00] fail because Bale was the god of
[49:02] fertility. Let me tell you something and
[49:04] say it with all of my heart tonight. We
[49:05] don't worship God out of fear.
[49:08] &gt;&gt; We don't come to church out of fear. We
[49:09] don't take communion out of fear
[49:11] &gt;&gt; cuz we think something bad's going to
[49:13] happen to us. We don't do that. That's a
[49:15] forced worship. It's Catholicism.
[49:17] &gt;&gt; We don't do what we do out of fear.
[49:19] Anytime a man comes to you and says,
[49:20] "Well, if you don't do this, you'll lose
[49:22] your money in the bank or you'll have a
[49:23] bad wreck or if you don't follow me and
[49:25] listen to me." Brother Brandham taught
[49:26] us that was false prophets,
[49:29] &gt;&gt; right? That would do that. You don't
[49:30] ever let a man tell you that. You stay
[49:32] with the word.
[49:33] &gt;&gt; You young people stay with the word.
[49:34] Don't let somebody, oh, out of fear, I'm
[49:36] going to serve God. No, you serve God
[49:38] cuz you love him with all of your heart.
[49:40] Let it come from the inside. That's the
[49:42] worship that he wants. What house will
[49:44] you build me? He said, "What is the
[49:45] place of my rest? I want a redeemed
[49:47] body."
[49:48] &gt;&gt; People that are worshiping because they
[49:49] cuz they like to.
[49:52] &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? Cuz they want to.
[49:54] And a real seed of God will want to.
[49:57] &gt;&gt; There's something in their heart that
[49:58] want to worship. They want to take
[50:00] communion. They want to make things
[50:02] right. They want to live for God.
[50:04] It's something in their heart.
[50:07] Amen. Now
[50:10] they they told them if you don't take if
[50:12] you don't worship Bale your crops won't
[50:13] grow. So some of them they was having
[50:15] trouble with their crops. So they
[50:17] started worshiping Baal out of fear. But
[50:20] the Brand said that Bale is a round god.
[50:22] So the sun he said and God was a round
[50:25] god a sun god. They had great big brass
[50:26] plates reflect the sun looked like fire.
[50:29] And then the bread that Jeremiah said
[50:30] here that women would bake these cakes
[50:32] under bail was made round like the sun
[50:34] and it was laid upon the altar the pagan
[50:36] altar for communion made round like the
[50:38] sun or like the moon. They worshiped the
[50:40] god Ashroth as well which was the moon
[50:42] the moon goddess he said because it was
[50:45] like the sun god or the moon god. The
[50:46] Catholic church took that as we know and
[50:48] made it the son of god right and and and
[50:50] Mary the mother of god but was the son
[50:53] god and the moon god. And brother
[50:55] Brandham said the Roman priests and they
[50:57] adopted this by taking and making
[50:58] communion. The first thing come up was
[51:00] making communion. Instead of a broken
[51:01] parcel like the body of Christ, they'd
[51:03] make it round like the sun or like the
[51:05] moon. And to this day, it's still round.
[51:08] Oh, he said, "Sure, it's still a round
[51:10] wafer, not a broken piece of its body.
[51:12] It's round and smooth." Roman priests
[51:14] today lay this round wafer on the altar
[51:16] and call it the literal body of Christ.
[51:18] And what are they doing worshiping Baal
[51:19] and don't know it? Worshiping Ashroth
[51:21] and don't know it.
[51:23] &gt;&gt; I hope you're with me tonight. We ought
[51:25] to thank God for the message of the
[51:26] hour. We ought to thank God for
[51:28] revelation. Brother Brandham talked
[51:30] about during his day, he said the
[51:31] priests and the the Catholics and the
[51:33] Pentecostals were trying to come
[51:34] together and he said they come down
[51:36] there. He said you had Pentecostal
[51:38] preachers sticking out their tongue and
[51:40] taking a round wafer
[51:42] &gt;&gt; because they thought, well, what
[51:43] difference does it make? Because they
[51:44] didn't have the revelation. They didn't
[51:46] have the word that we have access to
[51:47] that told us what it was.
[51:50] &gt;&gt; So they said, what difference does it
[51:51] make? It does make a difference. Amen.
[51:55] &gt;&gt; So he said they called it the literal
[51:57] body of Christ. They're communing with
[51:59] devils, worshiping other gods because
[52:00] they're sincere. They are sincere. Many
[52:03] of them, some Catholics, I've known
[52:04] Catholics that were more sincere than
[52:06] most message people.
[52:08] &gt;&gt; They they're sincere people, but they
[52:10] don't follow the pattern of the
[52:11] scripture.
[52:12] &gt;&gt; They don't follow the pattern, the model
[52:14] that's been set for us. So we find that
[52:17] Martin Luther during the church age took
[52:19] the church away from its idolatry. But
[52:21] over the last 150 years, the Protestant
[52:23] church got away from the pattern. You
[52:25] know what they did? They made a crackers
[52:27] and juice religion.
[52:30] Crackers. The fact that the modern
[52:32] Protestant church takes crackers, soda
[52:36] crackers, and grape juice for communion
[52:39] may be the greatest example of the kind
[52:42] of religion that they put on. They allow
[52:45] people to worship in. They want people
[52:47] to worship in. It's a crackers and juice
[52:50] religion.
[52:53] We got to wake up tonight just for a few
[52:54] more minutes. I'm not gonna hold you
[52:55] long. But you know what a crackers and
[52:57] juice religion is?
[52:59] &gt;&gt; It's whatever's convenient,
[53:02] sir.
[53:02] &gt;&gt; Right. We just take whatever is
[53:04] convenient. Crackers and juice.
[53:06] &gt;&gt; It It seems good.
[53:08] &gt;&gt; It makes us moral people. It seems like
[53:11] God would be pleased with it. So, let's
[53:13] just do it. So, it doesn't matter
[53:15] anymore. They buy it. I We could do it.
[53:16] We could buy crackers off of the
[53:18] internet that have been reserved for
[53:20] communion. We could or we could just go
[53:22] up to the store and buy the same thing.
[53:24] Or we could buy we could buy grape juice
[53:26] in a little carton and that's what they
[53:28] serve people. But brother Brandham says
[53:30] this. He said, "I do not believe that
[53:32] kosher bread should be substituted for a
[53:34] cracker." Listen, we we could preach on
[53:36] that for a while. I don't believe we
[53:38] ought to substitute the blood of Jesus
[53:40] Christ. I don't believe we ought to
[53:41] substitute the new birth. I don't
[53:43] believe we ought to substitute worship
[53:45] in the house of God. I don't believe we
[53:46] ought to substitute the real and take a
[53:48] form for it. I think we ought to strive
[53:50] for the real.
[53:52] &gt;&gt; Let's strive for the power of God. Let's
[53:54] strive for passion in our preaching,
[53:56] passion in our singing. Let's strive for
[53:58] the word of God to be preached among us.
[54:00] Let's strive to keep it real.
[54:03] &gt;&gt; Let's strive so that our children would
[54:05] be able to lay their hands on the same
[54:06] lamb that we laid our hands on and feel
[54:09] the presence of God and know that that
[54:11] life left the body of Jesus Christ so
[54:13] that they could be healed and they could
[54:14] be saved. a strive for that.
[54:17] &gt;&gt; We don't want a crackers and juice
[54:19] religion.
[54:21] &gt;&gt; We want the real thing.
[54:23] &gt;&gt; How many can say amen to that tonight?
[54:26] &gt;&gt; So, it matters what we take.
[54:29] &gt;&gt; The brand said, I believe it should be
[54:31] holy unleaven bread. The type of the
[54:33] unleaven bread that was made in Egypt, I
[54:35] believe the blood should not be grape
[54:36] juice, but it should be wine. Grape
[54:38] juice sour spoils as it gets old, but
[54:41] wine gets better and stronger as it gets
[54:43] old.
[54:44] Never. If you got a crackers and grape
[54:45] juice religion, it'll you'll be up today
[54:47] and down tomorrow. In today and out
[54:50] tomorrow. Today you're a Christian,
[54:52] tomorrow you're not. But if you can ever
[54:53] get a hold of the wine of the Holy
[54:55] Ghost, you ever get a become a part of
[54:57] the body of Christ by the Holy Ghost,
[55:00] you you you'll always be in the Holy of
[55:01] Holies, living under the light of the
[55:04] word. Listen, he said comm. It's a
[55:07] literal wine and bread. He said, he said
[55:10] communion bread should be made by people
[55:12] who's dedicated themselves and
[55:13] consecrated themselves to God. I thank
[55:15] God for consecrated hands can make our
[55:18] sisters to make communion bread. God
[55:19] bless you for doing that because you've
[55:22] consecrated yourselves to God to be able
[55:24] to do that. And and again, he said, "I
[55:26] went to a church once where they taken
[55:28] this old loaf bread where sinners
[55:29] cursing and carrying on filth and cut up
[55:31] that old bread, stuck it out there with
[55:33] some kind of juice to drink. I think
[55:34] I've told you before, but I remember
[55:36] vividly going to an Assembly of God
[55:38] church for a while when we were kids. We
[55:40] shared our church with an Assembly of
[55:41] God church. And nothing against the
[55:43] Assembly people, but there there's some
[55:45] good people in there, but there was an
[55:47] old man that mowed the lawn. And he'd
[55:48] come on communion night. He wouldn't
[55:50] come any other night of the week, any
[55:52] other service. He wanted to come on
[55:53] communion because he got fed. So he'd
[55:56] come on communion night. He take his old
[55:57] grubby fingers and he'd ride down there
[55:59] on his lawn mower cuz he'd lo had a DUI
[56:01] and he lost his license. and he right
[56:04] down there on his lawn mower and he'd
[56:05] put his hands in there and just grab a
[56:07] whole bunch of them soda crackers and
[56:09] he'd get two or three cups of grape
[56:11] juice and he was so happy and he wasn't
[56:13] happy if you didn't feed him enough. He
[56:15] just liked it. That's not how we take
[56:17] communion.
[56:18] &gt;&gt; Brother said cursing and carrying on and
[56:20] filth and cut up that old bread stuck it
[56:22] out there with some kind of a juice to
[56:23] drink. Brother said it was a filth to
[56:25] God.
[56:26] &gt;&gt; It was an abomination to God.
[56:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. He said to me that was ridiculous.
[56:32] said, "I believe it should be just
[56:33] exactly the way the scripture said it
[56:35] should be. Not very one speck from the
[56:38] scripture. Stay right with it."
[56:44] &gt;&gt; I know I get this feeling like, "Brother
[56:46] Ben, you're awful stirred up about
[56:47] communion. I believe it matters to the
[56:50] Lord."
[56:53] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon said, "It's been said by
[56:54] many, if I don't show, if I don't care
[56:56] about it, you won't care about it."
[56:58] &gt;&gt; We need to care about the things of God.
[57:01] Been said by many they wouldn't take
[57:03] wine, regular wine, because that was an
[57:04] alcoholic. It was a beverage and they
[57:05] should not take the wine. They took
[57:06] grape juice. He said the reason we take
[57:08] wine is because the Bible said wine.
[57:11] Huh? All translations give wine. If you
[57:12] go and say Jesus took the cup that was
[57:14] wine,
[57:16] &gt;&gt; right? That is not that's not grape
[57:17] juice. Grape juice wasn't invented.
[57:19] Grape juice sour within a few hours. He
[57:21] said, "But the blood of Jesus Christ
[57:22] gets sweeter and better as the years go
[57:24] by." How many can testify that tonight?
[57:27] &gt;&gt; Gets sweeter and better as the years go
[57:28] by. never sour or contaminates.
[57:31] The man by the name of Thomas Welch
[57:33] invented grape juice. He was a communion
[57:35] steward in a Methodist church. Did you
[57:36] know grape juice was invented for
[57:38] communion? That's the reason grape juice
[57:40] was invented because what had happened
[57:43] is the women's temperance movement had
[57:45] tried to do away with alcohol. And they
[57:47] said, "Well, we can't be out here
[57:48] preaching against alcohol and you guys
[57:51] here in church taking it in communion."
[57:53] So what they did is they they put such
[57:56] pressure on the leadership of the
[57:57] churches that the Methodist church began
[57:59] that that that idea and they put in
[58:01] their creed that they could not use
[58:03] alcohol-based wine. So it's very
[58:05] difficult to make something from grapes
[58:07] that's not doesn't turn into alcohol. It
[58:10] ferments very quickly. And so what they
[58:12] did is uh they changed the formula of it
[58:16] and Thomas Welch goes in he pasteurizes
[58:18] it. He figures out he was a dentist and
[58:20] he figured out how to do that. And when
[58:22] he when he did that, then they changed
[58:24] the formula of communion. Said, "Oh,
[58:25] it's grape juice." It was a good cause.
[58:28] I believe in temperance. I believe in
[58:30] prohibition.
[58:32] &gt;&gt; I believe they shouldn't sell wine on
[58:33] the street. It was a good cause, but it
[58:35] wasn't the pattern.
[58:37] &gt;&gt; It sounded right. It sounded reasonable,
[58:40] but it wasn't the pattern. So glad for a
[58:42] message. It restored us back to the
[58:44] pattern.
[58:47] &gt;&gt; No one can change the pattern. Brother
[58:49] Brandham, like Paul had inspiration. He
[58:51] said, "I received of the Lord." Brother
[58:52] Brandham had inspiration to restore and
[58:54] bring communion back to its biblical
[58:56] basis. Brother Brandham said, "I believe
[58:58] communion is one of the most solemn,
[58:59] sacred, sweetest worships there is in
[59:01] the church service." He said, "And for
[59:03] me, to me tonight, it seemed to be a
[59:05] very special time for me." He talked
[59:07] about how he stood there and was
[59:08] watching. He said, "Usually I'm
[59:09] constantly in prayer, but tonight I was
[59:11] watching the different families to see
[59:13] some of them families has come here
[59:14] since I was a boy preacher standing here
[59:16] with sawdust floors and some of them are
[59:17] new." He said, "But watching the men
[59:19] come with their little wives and family,
[59:21] see how they prefer one another, the
[59:22] sacredness of that, how they watch their
[59:24] children, see the little lady and her
[59:26] hands reach out and think that little
[59:28] hands washed and wiped the tears from
[59:29] the baby's eyes." Brother Bram's getting
[59:31] kind of emotional about it. But he said
[59:33] it meant something to him as a pastor to
[59:36] see them come across the platform.
[59:38] &gt;&gt; Right? He said, "Then I seen the
[59:40] families come up that I've been in their
[59:41] homes when they were sick and the fever
[59:43] children. The Lord Jesus make their
[59:44] children well. I've seen them when they
[59:46] had family trouble. The Lord helped me
[59:48] to get it smoothed out. See, I'm happy
[59:49] again. I got to thinking about our own
[59:51] stories. And I got to thinking about
[59:53] some where some of us come from. And I
[59:55] know what you've been through. And I
[59:56] know many of you don't know everything,
[59:57] but as a pastor, I don't know
[59:59] everything, but I know maybe a whole lot
[1:00:00] more than most. I know what some of
[1:00:02] y'all have struggled with. I know where
[1:00:03] you've been. And when you walk across
[1:00:05] and take a communion, it does something
[1:00:07] for my heart. I'm so grateful that God
[1:00:09] spared your life. I'm so grateful he
[1:00:11] spared my life. I'm so grateful that
[1:00:13] we're able to take communion together.
[1:00:15] Come on, church. It ought to mean
[1:00:16] something to us. We're still here. We're
[1:00:18] still taking communion. Yeah, the
[1:00:20] world's gone crazy. Yeah, we get sick
[1:00:22] sometimes and get weary, but we're still
[1:00:24] able to come across here and take
[1:00:25] communion. It means something to us.
[1:00:29] &gt;&gt; We've all got a story. I know what some
[1:00:30] of you have been through. I know what
[1:00:32] God brought you out of. I know the pit
[1:00:34] that you come from. But I know the grace
[1:00:36] of God that made you able and confident
[1:00:38] to walk across the place today and take
[1:00:41] communion with full assurance of God.
[1:00:45] That ought to make us run all across the
[1:00:46] building. We realize what God did for
[1:00:48] us, Sister Jane. He changed us, made us
[1:00:50] new, made us able to do this,
[1:00:53] &gt;&gt; and I'm so grateful for it.
[1:00:58] You forgive me for being emotional
[1:00:59] tonight, but I'm so grateful for the
[1:01:02] blood of Jesus Christ.
[1:01:08] &gt;&gt; Can we just
[1:01:09] &gt;&gt; Can you think about that without it
[1:01:12] meaning something to you? It it seemed
[1:01:14] like we get so caught up in the world
[1:01:17] and caught up in our troubles and caught
[1:01:18] up with what's going on and we don't
[1:01:20] even think about what's happening in
[1:01:21] front of us.
[1:01:22] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:01:23] &gt;&gt; He's still a miracle working God.
[1:01:26] &gt;&gt; He's still a God of miracles. He's a God
[1:01:28] that changes lives. He's a God that
[1:01:30] moves mountains.
[1:01:34] &gt;&gt; When I see you cross here, it makes me
[1:01:36] happy. Does something for me as a
[1:01:39] pastor. I think that's the way God meant
[1:01:41] it to be. He meant for the stories of
[1:01:44] the people to grab a hold of the heart
[1:01:45] of the pastor.
[1:01:49] &gt;&gt; He meant for for one another that you
[1:01:51] would know about one another. See other
[1:01:52] people and and we have a meeting and
[1:01:54] something that's wonderful. Wasn't our
[1:01:55] meeting wonderful?
[1:01:56] &gt;&gt; Didn't you enjoy the word and the
[1:01:58] presence and that helps us to have all
[1:01:59] those stories and things that are there?
[1:02:01] But there's something about the home
[1:02:02] folk.
[1:02:03] &gt;&gt; You know what they've been through. You
[1:02:05] know the area they live in cuz you live
[1:02:06] in it too.
[1:02:07] &gt;&gt; You know how hard their struggle is. You
[1:02:10] know what it's like to work in this
[1:02:11] area. You know what it's like to be in
[1:02:12] this area, live here. You know what it's
[1:02:14] like
[1:02:16] and you made it. I think we ought to
[1:02:17] care about other people like that.
[1:02:20] &gt;&gt; Oh, come on, church.
[1:02:21] &gt;&gt; If you can't, you know, if you look at
[1:02:23] your own story, say, "Well, I've always
[1:02:24] been a pretty good person." Well, good
[1:02:26] for you. But not everybody has.
[1:02:28] &gt;&gt; There have been some people delivered
[1:02:30] and we ought to thank God for it. There
[1:02:32] have been some people saved. We ought to
[1:02:33] thank God for it. There have been some
[1:02:34] people filled with the Holy Ghost, and
[1:02:36] we ought to thank God for it every
[1:02:38] moment of the day.
[1:02:40] Hallelujah.
[1:02:41] &gt;&gt; Well, I believe he still does it. Don't
[1:02:43] you?
[1:02:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:02:50] I believe his presence is here tonight.
[1:02:52] I want to hold you much longer, brother
[1:02:53] M. I've seen the families come up. I
[1:02:56] just think how it'll be when we go to
[1:02:57] that great wedding supper. He said, "I'm
[1:03:00] so thankful the Lord has let me be a
[1:03:02] friend to you and help you." He said,
[1:03:04] "That's what I'm here for." And I just
[1:03:06] think how long how many years about he
[1:03:08] said I started preaching about 1930 and
[1:03:10] it's about 32 years for me now. I've
[1:03:12] been preaching all the struggles and
[1:03:13] trials looks like though when we come up
[1:03:15] here it's all forgotten.
[1:03:17] &gt;&gt; I'm a young man but I got a lot of years
[1:03:19] behind me of preaching. I've been in
[1:03:20] this area a long time dealing with some
[1:03:22] of you folks for a long time and and I
[1:03:24] know you know listen when we come up
[1:03:27] here it's all forgotten.
[1:03:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:31] &gt;&gt; He said you seem like there something
[1:03:32] about communion takes all the twists out
[1:03:34] of things.
[1:03:37] taking communion.
[1:03:41] &gt;&gt; I might struggle. You might struggle.
[1:03:43] But I'm right with God.
[1:03:46] &gt;&gt; I'm testifying the blood was effective.
[1:03:49] &gt;&gt; I'm testifying it did its job.
[1:03:54] &gt;&gt; Come on, church. I I don't often get too
[1:03:57] emotional. I don't try to work you up.
[1:03:59] That's not the way I preach. It's not
[1:04:00] how I operate. But we ought to be
[1:04:01] thankful to God
[1:04:03] &gt;&gt; that we have a time where it takes all
[1:04:05] the twist out of things.
[1:04:09] &gt;&gt; Some Pentecostals got the idea of
[1:04:11] spiritual communion. So we just won't
[1:04:13] have communion. Brother Brandham dealt
[1:04:15] with that. The reason he preached a
[1:04:16] communion service at brother Perry
[1:04:17] Green's church and brother Perry, I've
[1:04:20] heard him say that myself that he he had
[1:04:22] to deal with that and nobody could agree
[1:04:23] on how to take communion. Brother
[1:04:24] Brandham had to come in and straighten
[1:04:25] it out and they still didn't agree on
[1:04:27] how to take communion. Some of them
[1:04:29] never did. I was raised, told you
[1:04:31] before, was raised as a child, unable to
[1:04:32] take communion because of false
[1:04:33] doctrine.
[1:04:36] &gt;&gt; I'm I'm glad. I'm grateful
[1:04:38] because it wasn't a man that
[1:04:39] straightened me out. It was the message
[1:04:40] of the hour.
[1:04:42] &gt;&gt; I'm grateful for that.
[1:04:45] He said, he said, "Brother Brandham, I
[1:04:46] don't," someone told Brother Brand, he
[1:04:48] said, "This precious brother,
[1:04:50] he come and said, I never did take it,
[1:04:52] brother Brandham. I don't understand
[1:04:53] what it is." Said, "I've been taught the
[1:04:54] other side."
[1:04:56] I said, "But remember, we will admit
[1:04:57] that St. Paul said it in order in the
[1:04:59] early Christian church, they went from
[1:05:00] church from house to house, broke the
[1:05:02] bread with singleness of heart and so
[1:05:03] forth. I said now he did put it in the
[1:05:05] church. Galatians 18, if an angel from
[1:05:07] heaven comes and says anything else, let
[1:05:09] it be a cursed. You see, the same one
[1:05:11] that had them to be rebaptized again
[1:05:13] from the baptism of John be rebaptized
[1:05:15] in the name of Jesus Christ. He said,
[1:05:16] you see, there are three things we must
[1:05:18] do as symbols. The Lord's supper, feet
[1:05:20] washing, and water baptism. I know
[1:05:23] people today, and I don't mean to be
[1:05:25] hard towards people or anything like
[1:05:26] that, but it grieves my heart. Today,
[1:05:28] people in the message are told we can
[1:05:30] take communion alone sitting in our
[1:05:31] homes, but it doesn't fit the pattern,
[1:05:36] sir.
[1:05:36] &gt;&gt; It's not what Paul said. It's not what
[1:05:38] Brother Brandon taught.
[1:05:40] &gt;&gt; Right? And and they go in a line and and
[1:05:42] pick it up and go home and take it. It's
[1:05:45] not the pattern.
[1:05:47] &gt;&gt; It's not It's not
[1:05:49] &gt;&gt; It's not a broken piece of bread. It's
[1:05:50] not a Are you with me now?
[1:05:53] &gt;&gt; It's not coming together.
[1:05:55] &gt;&gt; Listen what 1 Corinthians 11:33 says. He
[1:05:57] says, "Wherefore, my brethren, when you
[1:05:59] come together
[1:06:01] &gt;&gt; to eat,
[1:06:04] when you come together
[1:06:06] &gt;&gt; to eat, he's talking about communion
[1:06:09] because he said if you get hungry, eat
[1:06:10] at home,
[1:06:12] &gt;&gt; right? But when you come together to eat
[1:06:14] to take the communion, tear one for
[1:06:17] another.
[1:06:18] &gt;&gt; If any man hunger, let him eat at home.
[1:06:20] that you come not together into
[1:06:21] condemnation. So he says it's not a
[1:06:22] feast, it's a remembrance.
[1:06:25] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:06:26] &gt;&gt; And the rest will I set in order. He
[1:06:28] said when I come,
[1:06:29] &gt;&gt; brother Brandon says then when we come
[1:06:30] to the Lord's table, we must come in
[1:06:32] reverence, love, and respect of look
[1:06:35] where we would have been if it hadn't
[1:06:37] been for him.
[1:06:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:06:41] &gt;&gt; Therefore, Paul, he said, I think in
[1:06:42] saying this, wherefore when you come
[1:06:43] together to eat, Terry one for the
[1:06:45] other. That is other words, just wait a
[1:06:47] few minutes, pray, check yourself out,
[1:06:50] and if you know a brother is in there
[1:06:52] just about to do something that's wrong
[1:06:54] or something,
[1:06:55] &gt;&gt; you pray for him, too.
[1:06:56] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:07:00] &gt;&gt; But now we have virtual churches, taking
[1:07:02] virtual communion, never see one
[1:07:05] another,
[1:07:07] &gt;&gt; don't pray for one another. I'm not
[1:07:08] trying to be hard, but it's not what
[1:07:10] brother Brandham taught us.
[1:07:12] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:07:14] We're taught to take what? The communion
[1:07:16] together.
[1:07:17] &gt;&gt; When you come together, there's no way
[1:07:20] to do that alone.
[1:07:22] &gt;&gt; Terry, one for another. Look, he said if
[1:07:25] you know a brother's in there about to
[1:07:26] do something wrong or something, you
[1:07:27] pray for him, too.
[1:07:30] &gt;&gt; See, people want to remove all the
[1:07:32] responsibility for one another. But
[1:07:33] we're responsible for one another.
[1:07:36] &gt;&gt; See, if a member of the body falls, I'm
[1:07:38] responsible. He said, you that are
[1:07:40] spiritual receive such a one. He said in
[1:07:42] the spirit of restore such one in the
[1:07:44] spirit of meekness,
[1:07:46] right? We're responsible for one
[1:07:48] another.
[1:07:49] &gt;&gt; We have a responsibility not just to our
[1:07:50] own families but to other parts of the
[1:07:52] church. I'm responsible for these young
[1:07:53] people sitting here. I'm responsible to
[1:07:55] see that they're raised up into fear.
[1:07:57] Admon Lord. I know the primary
[1:07:58] responsibility is their parents but I'm
[1:08:00] also responsible.
[1:08:02] &gt;&gt; And if one fall falls away, I have a
[1:08:04] responsibility in that.
[1:08:06] &gt;&gt; Are you with me now? I know Satan is
[1:08:09] still fighting and he'll do everything
[1:08:10] he can to keep keep our young people out
[1:08:12] of the house of God, but we have a
[1:08:13] responsibility to do the right thing. Do
[1:08:16] everything we can to keep them in
[1:08:17] church.
[1:08:20] &gt;&gt; We have a responsibility at the
[1:08:21] communion table to look around us.
[1:08:24] &gt;&gt; Say, "Lord, protect my brothers.
[1:08:27] &gt;&gt; Protect my sisters.
[1:08:29] &gt;&gt; Help them." He said, "If you see one
[1:08:30] about to fall,
[1:08:31] &gt;&gt; pray for them."
[1:08:34] You can't do that unless you're in a
[1:08:37] group.
[1:08:38] &gt;&gt; Look, he said, he said, "If there's any
[1:08:41] feelings between Terry, one for the
[1:08:43] other." Wait just a minute. If there's
[1:08:44] any feelings between you or something,
[1:08:45] don't do it. Go make that right first.
[1:08:48] Go straighten that up because we want to
[1:08:49] come here just as pure as we can be. Our
[1:08:51] thoughts of one another and to God, to
[1:08:53] each other, and we come in fellowship
[1:08:55] around the table of the Lord. And we do
[1:08:56] this because that we are giving thanks
[1:08:58] to him and among one another.
[1:09:02] eating the bread between each other.
[1:09:05] Drinking the wine between each other as
[1:09:08] his blood and his flesh. Except you eat
[1:09:12] the flesh of the son of man. Drink his
[1:09:13] blood, you have no life in you. See, you
[1:09:15] see that's what the Bible said. Except
[1:09:16] you do it, there's no life. You're then
[1:09:19] more or less showing you're ashamed to
[1:09:20] identify yourself as a Christian. Now, I
[1:09:22] want to I want to clear something up on
[1:09:23] this. Just because you missed the
[1:09:24] communion service doesn't mean you're a
[1:09:26] sinner,
[1:09:28] &gt;&gt; right? But I think we ought to strive to
[1:09:29] be there if we can. Yeah,
[1:09:31] &gt;&gt; but just because you miss one doesn't
[1:09:33] mean you're a sinner. But if you refuse
[1:09:35] to take it,
[1:09:37] &gt;&gt; right? If communion is offered and
[1:09:38] you're there in the service and you
[1:09:40] refuse to take it, you're identifying
[1:09:42] yourself.
[1:09:44] &gt;&gt; Right? And if you refuse to take it,
[1:09:45] then you're saying, "I'm not a
[1:09:46] Christian." Well, that's okay. There's
[1:09:48] no shame in that. Become a Christian.
[1:09:52] &gt;&gt; Say, "Well, I've done something wrong.
[1:09:54] Make it right.
[1:09:56] Do it right now." You see, how long does
[1:09:57] that take? God knows your heart. Take
[1:09:59] it. It could be like that.
[1:10:01] &gt;&gt; It doesn't take fair. We should not be
[1:10:03] afraid to take communion
[1:10:06] &gt;&gt; because we don't have to take the body
[1:10:07] and blood of the Lord Jesus in in symbol
[1:10:10] form. We don't have to take it
[1:10:11] unworthily,
[1:10:13] &gt;&gt; but we can take it with a full assurance
[1:10:15] of faith knowing the blood is still
[1:10:16] effective and and he died for our sins
[1:10:19] and we're taking it as he looks at us
[1:10:21] through the blood. He said, brother
[1:10:22] Brandon said red through red looks
[1:10:24] white.
[1:10:25] &gt;&gt; We are sinless in his presence, sinless
[1:10:27] in his sight. Amen.
[1:10:29] &gt;&gt; So thankful for that,
[1:10:30] &gt;&gt; sir.
[1:10:31] &gt;&gt; It's a serious thing.
[1:10:33] It's uh I believe we have a piano and an
[1:10:36] organ for the communion. If you could
[1:10:37] come and
[1:10:41] getting ready to change the order of the
[1:10:43] service.
[1:10:44] It's a serious saying. We want to stay
[1:10:47] with the pattern.
[1:10:50] We want to stay with the pattern. It
[1:10:51] means something.
[1:10:53] All of these things have a meaning,
[1:10:56] right? It's important that we keep doing
[1:10:58] it
[1:10:59] and not that we just leave it and say,
[1:11:01] "Well, it's not really that important."
[1:11:02] And then years go by and we don't take
[1:11:05] it. It is important.
[1:11:08] It's time for a checkup.
[1:11:12] It's a good time to Lord, am I in the
[1:11:15] faith?
[1:11:18] Examine yourselves.
[1:11:20] Paul says
[1:11:23] he told us to tar one for another.
[1:11:26] It's a serious thing to stay with the
[1:11:28] word. Brother Brandham talked about the
[1:11:30] vision that he had and I referenced it
[1:11:33] the other night. He said, "Remember in
[1:11:35] my vision when he was caught behind the
[1:11:38] curtain of time. I said, "If Paul's
[1:11:41] people goes in, so will mine."
[1:11:45] And usually when brother Brandon says
[1:11:46] this, he'll say, "I taught what I
[1:11:47] preached what Paul preached." But in
[1:11:49] this place, he says it in an in an
[1:11:51] interesting way. He says, "I done
[1:11:53] exactly like he did."
[1:11:58] I done exactly like he did. Oh church,
[1:12:01] let's just stay as close to the word as
[1:12:03] we can stay.
[1:12:05] &gt;&gt; Just as close as we can stay for the
[1:12:07] benefit of our children,
[1:12:09] &gt;&gt; let's keep our hearts just as pure as we
[1:12:11] can keep them. Keep our walk just as
[1:12:14] straight as we can keep it.
[1:12:17] I say, "Oh, God, help me today. I know I
[1:12:20] I'm a I'm an example to these young
[1:12:22] people, an example to these old. Let me
[1:12:23] remain just as clear as I can be, as
[1:12:26] clean as I can be, as godly as I can be.
[1:12:29] If I do make a mistake, let me quickly
[1:12:31] repent so that my children can see the
[1:12:34] power of the forgiveness of God's grace.
[1:12:38] Let them see the blood in action.
[1:12:41] We bow our heads together.
[1:12:44] We get ready for the communion service.
[1:12:45] Maybe now, right now, we can tar one for
[1:12:47] the other.
[1:12:49] Pray one for another.
[1:12:52] You pray for me. Brother Brandon taught
[1:12:54] us the pastor congregation should pray
[1:12:56] for the pastor and the pastor for the
[1:12:58] congregation.
[1:12:59] [Music]
[1:13:02] We should not do it out of form. You
[1:13:05] know, if you get cold towards the house
[1:13:07] of God, especially towards a communion
[1:13:09] service, you don't have to be that way.
[1:13:13] [Music]
[1:13:16] Let God squeeze your heart.
[1:13:19] Just let the Holy Spirit in. Give him
[1:13:21] time. Give him space.
[1:13:26] Let it mean something to you.
[1:13:30] Let it be real.
[1:13:32] See, the the fight that we fight today
[1:13:34] is Satan trying to make it a form,
[1:13:36] trying to make it something it's not.
[1:13:38] But let it be real.
[1:13:42] real in our hearts, real in our lives,
[1:13:44] real in our daily walk. The bread is
[1:13:47] just a symbol. The wine is just a
[1:13:48] symbol. But the reality, the spirit of
[1:13:51] Christ, the literal life of Christ in us
[1:13:55] will make a difference.
[1:13:57] Could you pray one for another now as I
[1:13:59] do as well? Oh Jesus.
[1:14:04] Oh, we love you today. We thank you.
[1:14:10] Oh Jesus.
[1:14:13] [Music]
[1:14:18] Hallelujah.
[1:14:20] [Music]
[1:14:22] Hallelujah.
[1:14:25] Lord Jesus,
[1:14:28] we go partake of this communion service.
[1:14:32] I pray you'd forgive me, Lord, if
[1:14:34] there's anything in my life.
[1:14:37] Wash me thoroughly from mine iniquity,
[1:14:40] oh God.
[1:14:42] Purge me with hissip that I may be
[1:14:45] clean.
[1:14:47] Wash me and I'll be wider as stone.
[1:14:52] Oh granted, Lord Jesus.
[1:14:55] Help my brothers, my sisters, Lord, the
[1:14:56] young people of this church.
[1:15:00] Oh, as we wait one for the other. I
[1:15:01] pray, God,
[1:15:04] there wouldn't be one that would be
[1:15:05] afraid of the communion table, but that
[1:15:07] they would know all sin is under the
[1:15:10] blood. I pray you'd grant it, Lord.
[1:15:14] We love you. We thank you, Lord, if
[1:15:16] there's one here that hasn't met you, I
[1:15:18] pray, Lord, they would meet you right
[1:15:20] now in the presence, Lord, that is here
[1:15:23] or you're here to meet them. I pray you
[1:15:25] would do that. warmed their heart, Lord,
[1:15:27] as you've warmed mine and warmed these
[1:15:29] others. We pray in Jesus name.
[1:15:34] Hallelujah.
[1:15:36] Hallelujah. Let's sing this before we
[1:15:38] read the scripture. Draw me Lord.
[1:15:42] Oh, draw
[1:15:45] me
[1:15:47] Lord.
[1:15:49] Oh, don't you love him? Oh, draw
[1:15:53] me,
[1:15:55] Lord,
[1:15:57] &gt;&gt; and I'll
[1:16:00] [Music]
[1:16:02] after you. Make it your prayer now. Oh,
[1:16:05] I need
[1:16:08] you
[1:16:10] now. Oh, thank you, Lord. Oh Lord, I
[1:16:14] need
[1:16:15] you
[1:16:17] now.
[1:16:20] Oh Lord, I need
[1:16:23] you
[1:16:24] now.
[1:16:27] So come and take
[1:16:31] me away.
[1:16:34] Sing it softly now. Draw
[1:16:37] me
[1:16:39] Lord.
[1:16:41] Oh, thank you Jesus. Draw
[1:16:45] me
[1:16:47] Lord.
[1:16:49] Oh, please draw
[1:16:52] me,
[1:16:54] Lord.
[1:16:56] Oh, and I'll run
[1:17:01] after you.
[1:17:04] Hallelujah. As they continue to play,
[1:17:09] let's stand together.
[1:17:12] The brothers would come and do the
[1:17:14] communion. It's already up here.
[1:17:17] 1 Corinthians 11,
[1:17:25] [Music]
[1:17:27] Paul says, "For I have received of the
[1:17:29] Lord that which also I delivered unto
[1:17:30] you." Verse 23, "That which the Lord
[1:17:33] Jesus the same night in which he was
[1:17:35] betrayed, took bread. When he had given
[1:17:37] thanks, he broke it and said, "Take,
[1:17:38] eat. This is my body which is broken for
[1:17:41] you. This do in remembrance of me."
[1:17:45] After the same manner also he took the
[1:17:46] cup when he had sucked, saying, "This
[1:17:48] cup is the new testament in my blood.
[1:17:51] This do you as often as you drink it in
[1:17:53] remembrance of me. For as often as you
[1:17:55] eat this bread and drink this cup, you
[1:17:57] do show the Lord's death till he come."
[1:18:01] Amen.
[1:18:03] Thank the Lord.
[1:18:12] Lord Jesus, I hold in my hands the
[1:18:14] bread.
[1:18:16] So thankful for a restoration of true
[1:18:18] communion,
[1:18:20] Lord, both spiritually and naturally to
[1:18:22] the people of God.
[1:18:24] I thank you for your broken body
[1:18:28] which was broken for me. I thank you
[1:18:32] Lord.
[1:18:34] Ask you to come and heal.
[1:18:37] Lord, your stripes were for my healing,
[1:18:39] for our healing.
[1:18:41] And I ask you to heal every every
[1:18:43] disease, every sickness, every
[1:18:47] every mental trouble, Lord. Every
[1:18:49] spiritual trouble. I pray you'd heal it
[1:18:52] today. We thank you for it in Jesus
[1:18:55] name. Thank you, Lord Jesus.
[1:18:59] Lord Jesus, I hold in my hands the wine
[1:19:02] which is represents your blood.
[1:19:04] We're so thankful for your blood, Lord.
[1:19:07] Lord, we realize it's not the chemical
[1:19:09] of the blood, but the literal life of
[1:19:11] the blood that comes back on the
[1:19:13] believer, Lord, I pray that every person
[1:19:15] under the sound of my voice today would
[1:19:17] be filled with the Holy Ghost. Lord,
[1:19:20] when we come back together after Lord,
[1:19:22] at the end of after footwashing, I pray,
[1:19:25] oh God, that our worship would not be
[1:19:27] just something we do, but Lord, it'd be
[1:19:30] from the heart,
[1:19:32] oh God, cuz your spirit lives in us. So
[1:19:35] thankful, Lord, for your blood. Thank
[1:19:38] you for washing us whiter than snow. We
[1:19:41] pray that you'd bless the people, heal
[1:19:42] them, Lord, as they partake of the
[1:19:44] communion. We pray in Jesus name. Amen.
[1:19:48] Thank you, Lord. Brother Jared directs
[1:19:50] you. God bless you.

[1:29:40] You were there

[1:29:54] that man
[1:29:56] in the middle.
[1:30:01] Oh, because I know
[1:30:05] he first
[1:30:07] loved me.
[1:30:10] Oh, singing praise to the man
[1:30:17] who died on Mount Calvary.
[1:30:22] The middleman
[1:30:24] made it possible
[1:30:27] so that I could go free. We raise our
[1:30:31] hands again and sing it now.
[1:30:33] &gt;&gt; Oh, I love
[1:30:37] the man
[1:30:39] in the middle.
[1:30:43] Oh, because I know
[1:30:47] he first
[1:30:49] loved me.
[1:30:52] Hallelujah. We're singing praise to
[1:30:57] that man
[1:30:59] who died on Mount Calvary.
[1:31:04] The middle man made it possible
[1:31:09] so that I could.
[1:31:14] as we read from John chapter 13
[1:31:24] says now before the feast of the
[1:31:26] Passover when Jesus knew that his hour
[1:31:28] was come he should depart out of this
[1:31:29] world unto the father having loved his
[1:31:32] own which were in the world he loved
[1:31:33] them until the end and supper being
[1:31:36] ended the devil having now put into the
[1:31:38] heart of Judas's scariot Simon's son to
[1:31:40] betray
[1:31:42] Jesus knowing that the Father had given
[1:31:44] all things into his hands that he was
[1:31:47] come from God and went to God. He riseth
[1:31:50] from supper and laid aside his garments
[1:31:52] and took a towel and girded himself.
[1:31:55] After that he pth water into the basin
[1:31:57] and began to wash the disciples feet to
[1:32:00] wipe them with the towel wherewith he
[1:32:02] was girded. Then cometh you to Simon
[1:32:05] Peter. And Peter said unto him, Lord,
[1:32:06] dust thou wash my feet? Jesus said
[1:32:09] answered and said unto him, "What I do,
[1:32:11] thou knowest not now, thou shalt know
[1:32:13] hereafter." Peter saith unto him, "Thou
[1:32:16] shalt never wash my feet." Jesus
[1:32:18] answered him, "If I wash thee not, th no
[1:32:20] part with me."
[1:32:23] Simon Peter said to him, Lord, not my
[1:32:25] feet only, also my hands and my head."
[1:32:28] Jesus saith to him, "He that is washed
[1:32:30] needeth not, saved to wash his feet, but
[1:32:32] he's clean every wit. You're clean, but
[1:32:34] not all. For he knew he who should
[1:32:36] betray him. Therefore said ye, you're
[1:32:39] not all clean.
[1:32:42] Could I stop there just a minute? He
[1:32:44] knew who would betray him, but didn't
[1:32:46] stop him from washing his feet.
[1:32:51] [Music]
[1:32:53] So after he had washed your feet and had
[1:32:54] taken his garments and was set down
[1:32:56] again, he said unto them, "Know ye what
[1:32:57] I've done to you? You call me Master and
[1:33:00] Lord, and you say well, for so I am. If
[1:33:03] I then, your Lord and Master, have
[1:33:05] washed your feet, you also ought to wash
[1:33:07] one another's feet. For I have given you
[1:33:10] an example that you should do as I have
[1:33:12] done to you. Verily, verily, I say unto
[1:33:14] you, the servant is not greater than his
[1:33:16] Lord, neither he that is sent greater
[1:33:17] than he that sent him. If you know these
[1:33:20] things, happy are you if you do then.
[1:33:22] Let's bow our heads one more time.
[1:33:24] Heavenly Father, we thank you for the
[1:33:26] privilege of washing our brother's feet,
[1:33:29] sisters to sisters. Lord, I thank you
[1:33:32] for that.
[1:33:35] Lord, you came down and washed the feet
[1:33:37] of men who weren't even filled with the
[1:33:39] Holy Ghost at that time. They didn't
[1:33:41] even know what they were doing, what you
[1:33:43] were doing. But Lord, you told them if
[1:33:46] you'll do these things, you'll be happy.
[1:33:48] So, we're happy tonight to be able to do
[1:33:50] what you've left for us to do. Lord, may
[1:33:53] it not just be a form that we do, but
[1:33:55] may we truly love one another.
[1:33:58] Lord, if there's any aught in our heart
[1:34:00] against any person, I pray you'd take it
[1:34:03] out. Lord,
[1:34:05] maybe we built up resentment or or some
[1:34:08] kind of a a feeling in our heart against
[1:34:10] somebody. I pray you'd remove it right
[1:34:12] now, Lord. We don't want to be that way.
[1:34:16] We want to be right. I pray you'd grant
[1:34:18] it. Lord, we thank you for all that
[1:34:19] you've done. May we wash one another's
[1:34:22] feet as if we're washing your feet. We
[1:34:25] know we are the body of Christ. We thank
[1:34:28] you for that in Jesus name. Amen. God
[1:34:33] bless you. The brothers, you may be
[1:34:35] seated. Uh the brothers will go back
[1:34:38] here as they're called. The sisters
[1:34:42] will go to the back. I believe they've
[1:34:44] got enough back there for them to get
[1:34:45] started. So the sisters can go on back
[1:34:47] to the foyer. The brothers will go back
[1:34:50] as they're called. God bless you
[1:34:51] tonight. And we'll gather together here
[1:34:53] in the sanctuary just for a moment when
[1:34:55] we're done to worship.
[1:34:57] Hallelujah. He first loved me.
[1:35:03] Oh, I want to say praise to
[1:35:07] that man
[1:35:09] who died on Mount Calvary.

[1:35:21] go free. Sing it again with all your
