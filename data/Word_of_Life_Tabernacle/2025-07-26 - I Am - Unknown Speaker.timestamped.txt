[0:01] When it was dark
[0:04] in my heart,
[0:08] you brought life to me.
[0:12] &gt;&gt; A child of darkness
[0:16] became a child of light. Amen.
[0:23] &gt;&gt; When my soul
[0:26] was so dry,
[0:30] &gt;&gt; you and I needed drink
[0:34] the waters
[0:37] of life
[0:39] you became to me.
[0:44] I am
[0:47] I am
[0:51] you gave to me.
[0:54] I am alpha.
[0:57] I am omega.
[0:59] The in between.
[1:04] I am
[1:07] I am.
[1:11] You said to me,
[1:15] "I'll be what it takes
[1:19] &gt;&gt; to meet your need."
[1:25] &gt;&gt; You were the widow's crucifous.
[1:34] You were the shelter for Noah. Come on.
[1:40] A shepherd for the sheep.
[1:44] And in the fire
[1:46] you were the fourth man
[1:50] and a cloud by day,
[1:54] a fire by night for your children
[1:58] to lead the way.
[2:03] I am
[2:06] I am.
[2:09] You said to me
[2:12] I am Alpha.
[2:15] I am Omega.
[2:17] The in between.
[2:22] I
[2:23] am
[2:25] my arm.
[2:28] You said to me,
[2:32] "I'll be what it takes to meet your
[2:37] need.
[2:39] [Music]
[2:41] I am
[2:44] I am."
[2:47] You said to me,
[2:50] [Music]
[2:51] I am the bread of life
[2:56] standing.
[2:59] I
[3:01] am
[3:03] I am.
[3:06] You said to me,
[3:10] I'll be what it takes to meet your
[3:15] needs.
[3:19] I'll even go the way to Calary.
[3:28] [Music]
[3:30] Aren't you glad for that? Glory to God.
