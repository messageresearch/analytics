[45:25] Second Kings 12 and 1 we'll read down

[45:30] I made a mistake
[45:34] last week we were supposed to have
[45:36] communion
[45:37] and it was the month the first of the
[45:40] month we have communion every other
[45:42] month and I argued with Joel last week
[45:45] for about 30 minutes about that I I was
[45:48] certain that we'd had it and sister
[45:50] Sharon asked me this morning I told you
[45:52] wrong as well but we will have it next
[45:54] month the first Sunday of next month so
[45:56] you deacons keep me uh keep me informed
[45:59] as to what time that is because I
[46:01] evidently just forgot and y'all forgive
[46:04] me it just shows how human that I am and
[46:07] my wife already knew that but the rest
[46:08] of you learned that and uh so I
[46:11] apologize about that I do take that
[46:13] seriously I try to have it on a regular
[46:15] basis and uh so we could be prepared for
[46:18] that but we'll do it the first Sunday of
[46:20] next month on that Sunday evening I
[46:23] remember no service on Wednesday the
[46:25] 10th meeting starts on Wednesday night I
[46:27] heard that brother Andrew Glover is
[46:30] supposed to be speaking on Wednesday
[46:31] night so it'd be good if you can go and
[46:33] hear him I know this church loves
[46:34] brother Andrew and uh and then they'll
[46:37] have service all the rest of the week
[46:39] and different different preachers good
[46:41] preachers preaching so but we will have
[46:43] church here next Sunday amen second
[46:46] Kings chapter 12 and verse 1.
[46:49] in the seventh year of jehu jeho Ash and
[46:53] it's the same person as joash the king
[46:56] began to Reign and 40 years reigned he
[46:59] in Jerusalem and his mother's name was
[47:01] zebaya of Beersheba
[47:03] and jehosh did that which was right in
[47:07] the sight of the Lord all his days oh I
[47:10] wish that could be written about me and
[47:12] if I go before the coming of the Lord
[47:14] that someone would write that in my
[47:16] Epitaph that they could say that about
[47:19] me that I did what was right but there's
[47:21] a qualifier when it comes to King joash
[47:23] it says all his days wherein Jehovah the
[47:28] priest instructed him
[47:30] so as long as he set under that Ministry
[47:33] of jehodaya the priest as long as he was
[47:36] counseled by him he stayed with the word
[47:39] he uh he stayed in church if we could
[47:42] say it that way he did what was right
[47:43] but there were some things he didn't do
[47:46] he said the high places were not taken
[47:48] away the people still sacrificed and
[47:50] burnt incense in the high places I pray
[47:54] the Lord would add his Blessing to the
[47:55] word you may be seated I want to speak
[47:57] to you tonight about the counselor
[48:01] this morning rather about the counselor
[48:04] part of having a happy home
[48:08] and a nice home
[48:10] is listening to the right people
[48:14] and it's something we all have to do and
[48:16] none of us really want to do is listen
[48:19] to people and yet you have to be careful
[48:21] who you listen to Larry Burkett the old
[48:24] uh he was a financial advisor I think
[48:27] he's passed on now but he said A wise
[48:29] man seeks much counsel a fool listens to
[48:33] all of it
[48:34] so you you have to understand that
[48:36] there's a lot of bad advice out there
[48:38] someone has said that that most common
[48:41] one of the most common things in this
[48:43] country is bad advice it's everybody's
[48:46] got advice and most of it is bad but we
[48:49] need to know who to listen to and I like
[48:51] that the scripture shows us this that as
[48:54] long as the priest jehodaya was alive
[48:57] and and he was instructing joash in the
[49:00] things of God that joash continued to do
[49:03] what was right and we know joash lived
[49:06] for many many years and perhaps when
[49:07] jehodaya died he thought well now I've
[49:10] reached a place where I don't need
[49:12] advice anymore I don't need counsel I
[49:14] don't need to reach out to anybody
[49:16] because I I'm older and he reigned for I
[49:19] think some 40 years and he said well I'm
[49:22] older now I can go do it on my own but
[49:24] we never reached the age where we can
[49:27] completely do without advice advice
[49:30] isn't just for young married couples
[49:31] counsel isn't just for them but it's for
[49:34] us as well have been around a little bit
[49:36] longer and even those who are much older
[49:39] sometimes you just need to ask
[49:42] and I know that's hard on some of us
[49:44] especially us men we don't like asking
[49:46] for advice
[49:48] we don't like asking for directions
[49:51] I'll be honest with you my wife every
[49:53] time we have this thing if I don't know
[49:55] where something is in the store I'll
[49:57] call her and ask her and she but if she
[50:00] don't know I won't ask the person at the
[50:02] front
[50:03] how many other men we got brother Mark
[50:05] knows what I'm talking about
[50:06] and so I don't want to ask and I don't
[50:09] know what it is it's just hard
[50:12] I do not want to ask the guy and admit
[50:14] that I don't know where the pepperoncini
[50:16] peppers are you know I just
[50:19] I don't even not even sure what they are
[50:21] but
[50:22] I've stood there before and and stared
[50:25] at the Shelf full of peppers and full of
[50:27] pickles or whatever it is and I just
[50:29] don't see it and but instead of asking
[50:32] it it has to I have to be really
[50:33] desperate and really want something to
[50:36] ask because it there's something about
[50:39] it that you have to kind of humble
[50:41] yourself
[50:42] to ask for advice and at directions the
[50:45] same way if back in the day when we
[50:47] didn't have GPS we had to ask for
[50:49] directions and and many times a man we
[50:52] were famous for that we don't like to
[50:54] ask for directions we'd rather be lost
[50:57] than someone know that we were lost
[51:00] but when that comes into our spiritual
[51:02] lives we that's a problem
[51:04] sometimes we just need to talk to
[51:06] somebody
[51:08] and again we've got to be careful who we
[51:10] talk to and who we listen to because
[51:12] some people got some really bad advice
[51:16] right don't don't ask and sometimes
[51:19] here's the problem as human beings we
[51:21] tend to ask the wrong people because
[51:24] we're looking for an Echo chamber
[51:26] I read a story about a about a man who
[51:30] was golfing and he was out on the
[51:32] practice range and here come a golf pro
[51:34] with a brand new golfer he was bringing
[51:36] him out there and he was standing there
[51:37] and and golf is harder so I've been told
[51:40] a couple times I've only been a couple
[51:42] times in my life and I didn't do well
[51:43] and but I was never taught and this golf
[51:46] pro is going to bring this man out and
[51:48] he stood there and the man was observing
[51:50] him as he began to teach him and he'd do
[51:52] something he'd say well that's not how
[51:53] you do it you do it differently every
[51:55] time he did the man he brought out would
[51:57] correct him he said oh no he said I
[51:59] think it's this way and said after a
[52:01] while the golf pro just just quit giving
[52:03] him advice and so every time he just say
[52:05] yeah that's right you just go ahead and
[52:07] do that and the man was worse when he
[52:09] left and when he come in
[52:10] and but but he the golf pro still got
[52:13] paid
[52:15] and and so the other man told the golf
[52:17] pro he said I can't believe that you let
[52:19] him tell you those things and agreed
[52:21] with him he said I learned a long time
[52:22] ago that if a man wanted to pay me to be
[52:25] an echo chamber I would let him
[52:29] right and there's people out there like
[52:31] that oh yeah you go ahead you know
[52:33] somebody's out of church don't ask them
[52:35] whether you should go to church or not
[52:37] all right they want you to be out of
[52:39] church too so they feel better about
[52:40] themselves
[52:42] somebody that that does things that are
[52:45] wrong constantly and continually
[52:46] habitually now sometimes you can get
[52:48] good advice from somebody who has been
[52:50] wrong but realize they were wrong and
[52:51] straightened it up
[52:53] but with somebody that's habitually
[52:54] making the same mistake you don't want
[52:56] to ask them about that they're they're
[52:57] making the same mistake you don't want
[52:59] to make
[53:00] so we need to seek counsel from the
[53:02] right people and as we move through this
[53:04] I want us to especially understand that
[53:07] we must also reach a place of maturity
[53:09] that we realize that that there's some
[53:12] things that God has to reveal to us and
[53:14] we need to get to a place where he is
[53:16] our counselor and he's able to the Holy
[53:18] Spirit actually is able to lead us and
[53:21] to guide us into the right way how many
[53:23] want that this morning
[53:25] so we it's important to ask for advice
[53:28] to ask for help
[53:30] the Bible tells us in Proverbs 20 and 5
[53:33] counsel in the heart of man is like deep
[53:35] water
[53:36] but a man of understanding will draw it
[53:39] out
[53:40] steep water he's just like a well but a
[53:43] man of understanding will draw it out in
[53:45] other words he's saying don't be
[53:46] arrogant or you'll Reveal Your Own
[53:48] ignorance
[53:50] right sometimes not asking just makes
[53:53] you ignorant
[53:54] but he said a man of understanding will
[53:57] pull it out he'll he'll he'll put the
[53:59] bucket in and he'll he'll make an effort
[54:01] to spend time around people who know
[54:03] more than he does you don't want to just
[54:05] spend time around people like you
[54:08] right you want to spend time around
[54:10] people who know things that you don't
[54:12] know because if you do that you'll end
[54:14] up learning things that you didn't know
[54:16] you know there are things that you don't
[54:18] know
[54:19] what's a revelation isn't it there's
[54:22] things I don't know
[54:24] are you with me now but if I hang out
[54:26] around somebody who's done it longer
[54:28] than I have and been experienced
[54:30] sometimes I'll learn something that I
[54:32] didn't know
[54:33] right and it's amazing Sometimes some of
[54:36] the questions I get and I scratch my
[54:38] head sometimes I think well I can't
[54:39] believe people didn't know that but but
[54:41] still if you don't know you need to ask
[54:43] don't assume that you know
[54:46] right and sometimes I think we need to
[54:48] ask more questions myself included so so
[54:51] what's he telling us in the scripture
[54:53] the more you actually understand the
[54:56] more you'll seek advice from others
[54:58] right you found that that's true if
[55:00] you've got a career you've got a job
[55:02] you've learned and I learned who to ask
[55:04] for advice
[55:06] and the reason why I got I guess fairly
[55:09] good at my job at least they didn't fire
[55:10] me I walked away from my job when I took
[55:12] the church but I kind of sort of retired
[55:15] at a young age and but uh just no no
[55:18] retirement money to go with it but but I
[55:20] did walk away from my job and one of the
[55:22] things that I did though while I was
[55:24] there is I learned to lean on people and
[55:27] and I had people who had done it for 40
[55:29] and 50 years and they weren't always
[55:31] right but they had usually been through
[55:34] that before
[55:35] because things tend to go in cycles and
[55:38] so usually they had they had dealt with
[55:40] that before and I learned that there
[55:42] were certain attorneys that I could ask
[55:44] for advice and get good advice and there
[55:46] were other attorneys that didn't care
[55:49] and so they just give me whatever popped
[55:51] on top of their head
[55:52] and they'd get me in trouble so I had we
[55:54] had underwriting attorneys in in my job
[55:56] I don't want to bore you this morning
[55:57] but there was one that I stayed away
[56:00] from I never asked him on anything
[56:02] important in fact I only asked him when
[56:05] I knew the answer and I and I needed him
[56:07] to sign off
[56:09] because I knew that he would
[56:11] right you've known people like that
[56:12] whatever I said had to be right
[56:15] yeah and that actually got me in trouble
[56:16] more than once because I thought I knew
[56:18] the answer
[56:19] but there was another attorney she would
[56:21] challenge me every time because she'd
[56:23] been doing it for 80 years or it seemed
[56:25] like and and she's been doing it all her
[56:27] life and and but she she had run across
[56:30] this before and she cared enough and
[56:33] that's a key right there you've got to
[56:34] talk to somebody that cares enough to to
[56:38] not only answer the question but to know
[56:40] enough about you to know why you're
[56:42] asking the question
[56:45] right because people ask questions for
[56:47] all kinds of different reasons
[56:49] so we've got to take time to pray
[56:52] do we still believe in prayer this
[56:54] morning I trust that you do we need to
[56:56] pray because that's the council we can
[56:59] get directly from God we need to pray
[57:01] and then take time to ask because
[57:03] sometimes God will reveal it to us
[57:06] through a person
[57:08] so and Proverbs 19 and 20 says Hear
[57:11] counsel and receive instruction that
[57:15] tell me is to be wise in thy latter end
[57:18] nobody comes into the world with wisdom
[57:22] right you know you're not just naturally
[57:24] born with wisdom you may be smart
[57:27] but you've got to learn and wisdom is
[57:30] not just learning but it's actually
[57:32] learning and having the ability to apply
[57:36] it
[57:36] so wisdom is more than just
[57:38] understanding or knowledge and so if you
[57:41] want wisdom if you want to be wise in
[57:43] your latter end when you get older if
[57:45] you want to be like brother Harold and
[57:46] be a a wise Sage with your gray hair and
[57:49] everything then if you want to be that
[57:51] way you've got to be willing to receive
[57:53] instruction at some point in your life
[57:55] and I've found listen to me I found some
[57:57] of the older folks that have been
[57:59] through some things are more willing to
[58:01] ask
[58:02] when they don't know then some of the
[58:04] folks that think well I know
[58:06] right and but we all need to be that way
[58:08] we just need to we need to sometimes
[58:09] just admit I'm not perfect I I make
[58:12] mistakes amen I I I'm a human being and
[58:16] human beings make mistakes that's who I
[58:18] am and so I need to find I need to find
[58:20] a place of counsel I read a story about
[58:23] a navigator who uh who was sure that he
[58:26] knew the directions to a certain airport
[58:28] and they were flying over a Canada over
[58:31] a country that was snowy and they got in
[58:33] a storm and so they're flying by their
[58:36] instruments and he set a certain course
[58:38] and and after a while they got a message
[58:41] from a control tower that could see they
[58:43] had veered off course they were going
[58:44] the wrong direction and they messaged
[58:46] him and they said sir they said you
[58:48] you've got the wrong instructions you
[58:51] you've messed up but see it was the
[58:53] control tower as a person he never had
[58:54] any confidence in he never talked to
[58:57] before and he was so sure that he was
[58:59] right
[59:00] that he continued going the way he was
[59:02] going and everybody in the plane
[59:04] actually died
[59:06] we need to understand where we're going
[59:08] he said well it's not that important
[59:10] what I do but it is important it's
[59:12] important to you and to your children
[59:13] and to the people that follow you
[59:17] now is this all right this morning when
[59:20] do we need counsel
[59:21] because we don't always need counsel
[59:24] right there's sometimes and I found that
[59:26] this is true sometimes people ask
[59:27] because because they this is just what
[59:30] they want to do and they want somebody
[59:31] to back them up
[59:32] but they already know what to do and
[59:34] it's not that
[59:36] all right but they're looking for
[59:38] somebody to back them up and looking for
[59:40] an Echo chamber and but when do we need
[59:42] counsel well when especially when it
[59:44] comes to the spiritual side because you
[59:46] can ask Council about natural things and
[59:48] I and I've told you this before but you
[59:50] if you ask me about a car I may not be
[59:53] able to tell you I may not be the best
[59:54] judge of vehicles
[59:57] right I bought some but I haven't I
[59:59] haven't had a real great track record
[1:00:01] buying cars
[1:00:04] are you surprised by that
[1:00:07] so if you ask me about it I can tell you
[1:00:09] what I did wrong but I may not you can
[1:00:11] ask me about your car praise God but
[1:00:13] there's nothing spiritual you know
[1:00:14] unless I would pray and the Lord would
[1:00:16] show me something but the Lord could
[1:00:17] show you something
[1:00:19] right so you can ask you're welcome to
[1:00:21] ask but it probably it may not do a
[1:00:24] whole lot of good but there's times in
[1:00:26] your life when there's Junctions as we
[1:00:28] travel through life we come to hard
[1:00:30] Corners turns and brother random told us
[1:00:34] that anybody can build a wall
[1:00:36] but it takes a prophet he said to see
[1:00:38] around the corner and so we need to go
[1:00:40] back to find out what a prophet said
[1:00:42] about certain things so sometimes we
[1:00:44] need to ask a pastor or ask somebody
[1:00:46] when we come to those hard Junctions of
[1:00:48] life like like who should I marry
[1:00:51] or should I get married
[1:00:54] right am I am I ready to do that and I
[1:00:57] remember asking before I came here to be
[1:01:00] a pastor before I accepted the
[1:01:02] invitation to come and then and then
[1:01:05] even try out for it I asked my pastor I
[1:01:07] said I said I know you can't tell me
[1:01:09] what to do I said but tell me if I'm
[1:01:12] ready
[1:01:13] all right tell me if I'm ready and then
[1:01:15] if you tell me that I'm ready then it
[1:01:17] gives me a little more confidence now
[1:01:19] that wouldn't admit that if you told me
[1:01:20] no that it wouldn't necessarily have
[1:01:22] done it but would have made me pray
[1:01:23] about it
[1:01:25] right it really made me get down to
[1:01:27] business because I had confidence in my
[1:01:28] pastor and so we ought to be able to ask
[1:01:31] about those important things now some
[1:01:34] some things we need help navigating
[1:01:35] sometimes we need to ask our wives
[1:01:40] and all the wives said amen
[1:01:44] huh
[1:01:46] not really
[1:01:47] but sometimes we need to ask our wives
[1:01:49] sometimes you need to ask your husband
[1:01:53] right there's times that we need to have
[1:01:55] walls or pointers that need navigating
[1:01:57] and you can't see yourself and so you
[1:02:00] need the perspective of someone else
[1:02:02] to be able pastors need to do that
[1:02:05] Sunday school teachers need to do that
[1:02:07] deacons need to do that and no matter
[1:02:08] how old you get you never get to a place
[1:02:10] where you well I just don't need it
[1:02:11] anymore
[1:02:14] and so you have walls that need turning
[1:02:18] they have married Jezebel at a junction
[1:02:20] in his life
[1:02:21] marriage is a junction
[1:02:23] so obviously he made a bad choice we can
[1:02:27] see that
[1:02:28] but AB couldn't see it
[1:02:30] and again I've told you in the life of
[1:02:32] Abe wasn't a bad guy
[1:02:34] it's not a bad dude but he excuse me for
[1:02:36] using that in the in the Pulpit but it
[1:02:38] just don't seem to be that bad of a guy
[1:02:40] but he does some horrible things makes
[1:02:43] some really bad decisions and one of
[1:02:45] them is marrying Jezebel and brother
[1:02:47] Madam told us he said that was a
[1:02:49] junction in his life and that's where he
[1:02:50] went off
[1:02:51] and I'm so happy to see uh those of you
[1:02:54] that are getting married not not
[1:02:55] marrying a jezebel because when you
[1:02:57] marry a jezebel you're going to have a
[1:02:59] jezebel as a counselor
[1:03:02] right because Jezebel will counsel
[1:03:04] but she'll give bad advice
[1:03:07] so we don't want to do that and and the
[1:03:09] the vice versa as well a woman you you
[1:03:11] have to you have to ask you need to you
[1:03:14] need to you need to seek counsel it
[1:03:16] don't mean you necessarily have to take
[1:03:18] it again only a fool accepts all the
[1:03:20] counsel that's offered to them
[1:03:22] but you need to you need to ask so
[1:03:24] you'll have uh something to work with
[1:03:27] When you pray
[1:03:29] when you go to a church that's important
[1:03:32] when you choose a church to go to we
[1:03:34] need to we need to pray about that we
[1:03:37] really do and and we need to ask we need
[1:03:39] to find out what kind of a church that
[1:03:41] that is
[1:03:42] when we and I I want to maybe dwell on
[1:03:45] this more next week so I won't spend as
[1:03:47] much time on it this week when we take a
[1:03:49] position in the church
[1:03:52] when we take a position we need to seek
[1:03:54] counsel because a position
[1:03:56] ought to be a place of Revelation
[1:03:58] I know I belong there
[1:04:01] and you operate in that position by a
[1:04:03] gift no matter what you do in the church
[1:04:05] if all you do is is take out the laundry
[1:04:08] right or clean the floors but there's
[1:04:09] you have an ability to do that right a
[1:04:13] gift something that in you to do that
[1:04:14] you operate by a gift now it's not the
[1:04:16] same as a faithful Ministry gift but it
[1:04:18] is a gift
[1:04:19] if you help with the with the dishes or
[1:04:21] or wash the dishes or or you help cook
[1:04:24] the food or whatever I know I I know
[1:04:27] this isn't jump and Shout this morning
[1:04:29] but you just hang with me for a while
[1:04:31] you know whatever it is that you do
[1:04:33] around the church you have a position it
[1:04:35] needs to be a revelation to you because
[1:04:36] if it's not a revelation to you you
[1:04:38] won't be faithful to it
[1:04:41] you don't realize the importance of it
[1:04:43] but if you realize how important it is
[1:04:45] for you to be at that spot and to be be
[1:04:48] filling your Pew and and to be there and
[1:04:50] and to stand there even on a Sunday
[1:04:52] morning or a Wednesday night or whatever
[1:04:54] it is once you realize the importance of
[1:04:56] that position it becomes a revelation to
[1:04:58] you and and how can you get that you
[1:05:01] know sometimes we need to ask should I
[1:05:03] do it not not can I do it but should I
[1:05:05] do it because not everybody that can
[1:05:07] fill a position should
[1:05:11] so who should we ask for counsel
[1:05:14] well more than one person
[1:05:18] now this it's a dangerous thing when we
[1:05:20] get to the place where there's only one
[1:05:21] person we ever ask for advice
[1:05:23] and usually when that's the case it's
[1:05:25] because that person is echoing us it's
[1:05:28] affirming us
[1:05:29] right right and that's what we want
[1:05:30] today isn't it affirmation brother Ben
[1:05:33] give me some affirmation okay I'll tell
[1:05:35] you go back to the word
[1:05:37] right but give me some affirmation and
[1:05:38] there's a place and a time for that but
[1:05:40] that's what we want many times but so we
[1:05:42] go to a person who will affirm Us in
[1:05:44] what we're doing and we do that on
[1:05:46] purpose but sometimes we need to ask
[1:05:48] many people Proverbs 11 14 says where no
[1:05:51] counsel is the people fall but in the
[1:05:53] multitude of counselors they're at
[1:05:54] safety uh Proverbs 24 6 for my wise
[1:05:57] counsel Thou shalt make thy war and in
[1:06:00] multitude of counselors they're at
[1:06:01] safety this is where joash made his
[1:06:03] mistake jehodaya was his only counselor
[1:06:07] and when he died he didn't move on
[1:06:10] oh God help us today how many people
[1:06:12] have done that around the message of the
[1:06:14] hour where their Pastor or or their
[1:06:17] leader or or maybe brother random
[1:06:19] himself passed away and he we have to
[1:06:22] move on and they would never accept
[1:06:23] counsel from anybody else
[1:06:26] and because they would never accept
[1:06:27] counsel from anybody else they begin to
[1:06:29] make bad decisions because we are people
[1:06:31] that need counsel no because now we
[1:06:36] should never lift one man up as the one
[1:06:39] who has all the answers right well
[1:06:43] you've got to be careful with that don't
[1:06:45] do that to me I I beg you I know that
[1:06:47] you don't but but don't do that to me
[1:06:50] because if I'm the guy that's got all
[1:06:52] the answers then that's a problem
[1:06:54] because I can be wrong there's two
[1:06:57] things that are true of all men
[1:06:59] they're fallible and they're mortal
[1:07:02] men are fallible and Mortal the best men
[1:07:06] the most dedicated men are still
[1:07:09] fallible and they're still mortal
[1:07:13] yes right so you need to sometimes you
[1:07:16] need to ask more than one person
[1:07:18] you need to have confidence in more than
[1:07:19] one person I want you to have confidence
[1:07:22] in me as a pastor but I want you to have
[1:07:23] confidence in these other ministers as
[1:07:25] well I want you to have confidence in
[1:07:27] one another
[1:07:29] because I may not always have the best
[1:07:31] advice I'll give you advice if you come
[1:07:32] ask for it that's free man I'll give you
[1:07:35] more than you ask for
[1:07:37] yeah but I'll give you advice even if
[1:07:39] you don't go here to church I I pass out
[1:07:42] advice on the freeway but that don't
[1:07:44] make it right
[1:07:46] but in the multitude of counselors
[1:07:48] there's safety now again joash did that
[1:07:51] he needed another jehodaya but he never
[1:07:53] couldn't move on and Satan wants to do
[1:07:56] that to you where you don't have
[1:07:57] confidence in in a pastor because of
[1:07:59] something that's happened to you in the
[1:08:00] past and until until you get to the
[1:08:03] place where you'll listen when I talk
[1:08:05] you know your kids are like that if you
[1:08:07] won't listen uh when uh when your
[1:08:10] parents if they won't listen when the
[1:08:11] parents talk you can't ever help them
[1:08:14] right they have to get to a place where
[1:08:16] they have enough so if they won't listen
[1:08:18] to you screaming at them doesn't help
[1:08:21] right
[1:08:23] they can shut out screaming you remember
[1:08:26] what it was like to be a kid
[1:08:27] you can sit there and yell at them all
[1:08:29] day long they'll never listen because
[1:08:31] they have you haven't opened them up
[1:08:33] right you got to get in their head
[1:08:35] somehow and open up that Spirit or and
[1:08:38] that mind to be able to listen to you
[1:08:41] just yelling and my kids should have
[1:08:43] said Amen on that I guess they're busy
[1:08:45] this morning but uh but you know just
[1:08:47] yelling doesn't work
[1:08:49] but you sometimes you need to take them
[1:08:51] on a fishing trip
[1:08:53] or do something with them and be a part
[1:08:56] of their lives now when it comes to
[1:08:58] being a pastor again I know that there's
[1:09:00] there's sometimes I can't tell you
[1:09:03] things that I I probably need to tell
[1:09:05] you
[1:09:06] but until I can get the key to unlock
[1:09:10] that there's nothing I can do so
[1:09:11] sometimes we really need the presence of
[1:09:14] God we really need the right atmosphere
[1:09:16] because in that atmosphere it unlocks
[1:09:19] you it makes you vulnerable to where you
[1:09:21] can receive the word and the seed can be
[1:09:23] planted
[1:09:25] and without the right atmosphere I can
[1:09:27] stand up here all day and say things but
[1:09:29] you're you haven't been unlocked your
[1:09:31] brain is is out there somewhere and or
[1:09:33] you're thinking or you've been hurt or
[1:09:35] you've been you've been scarred and you
[1:09:37] just can't you can't take it at face
[1:09:39] value and again I'm not asking you to
[1:09:41] believe everything I say but if it's the
[1:09:44] word we need to receive it
[1:09:47] amen
[1:09:49] and so we need to ask many people who do
[1:09:53] we need to ask we ask someone with
[1:09:54] experience
[1:09:56] and experience is not the same as age
[1:10:00] right it can be the same as age it's
[1:10:04] more often you're more likely to find an
[1:10:06] experienced person who's older simply
[1:10:08] because they've lived longer
[1:10:10] but just because they're old doesn't
[1:10:12] mean their experience
[1:10:15] if you've never done it you've never
[1:10:16] done it
[1:10:18] the Bible says the the hoary head and
[1:10:20] what that means is you're white-headed
[1:10:23] right praise God for the white-headed
[1:10:25] folks
[1:10:27] but David you've always been
[1:10:29] white-headed that don't mean you're old
[1:10:30] but
[1:10:32] my mother's been that way as well she's
[1:10:34] had white hair for years and years and
[1:10:36] years until anyway
[1:10:38] it's naturally white
[1:10:40] so almost ever since I can remember we
[1:10:42] were talking about that tonight I can
[1:10:43] remember when she was blonde but it was
[1:10:45] a long time ago she's still blonde but
[1:10:46] not
[1:10:48] um anyway
[1:10:50] not hair color
[1:10:52] so
[1:10:53] I woke you up didn't it
[1:10:56] so it should come with you know
[1:10:58] experience should come with age but it
[1:11:00] don't always so he says the whorehead or
[1:11:03] the gray head is a Crown of Glory if it
[1:11:05] be found in the way of righteousness
[1:11:08] right this is what illahu realizes in
[1:11:10] job 32 6 now who have said there can you
[1:11:13] imagine the conversation he sat there
[1:11:15] through the whole thing the Book of Job
[1:11:17] is a long book and it's full of job
[1:11:19] complaining and there's three friends
[1:11:21] complaining and job says I didn't
[1:11:23] deserve this I don't belong this isn't
[1:11:26] me and every once in a while he hits
[1:11:27] inspiration and he's up and he's down
[1:11:29] and and then his friends come up here
[1:11:31] and say you're a secret sinner you did
[1:11:33] something that God's punishing you for
[1:11:35] and so they just constantly going around
[1:11:36] and around and around and around about
[1:11:38] it and Ella who's sitting back because
[1:11:40] he's much younger than these other men
[1:11:42] and so he sits back and he says I he
[1:11:44] says I don't even want to speak he said
[1:11:47] age should speak
[1:11:49] and that's true
[1:11:51] but in this situation age was wrong
[1:11:54] because they'd never been through what
[1:11:56] job went through
[1:11:57] but brother Branham typed elohu with
[1:12:00] Christ
[1:12:01] amen in Christ as I've told you before
[1:12:03] wasn't even old enough to be on the
[1:12:05] Sanhedrin Council but he had inspiration
[1:12:07] from God he was God in flesh and so
[1:12:10] elohu says I'm young and you are very
[1:12:12] old I love the way he put that
[1:12:15] he didn't just say you're old you're
[1:12:17] very old you guys are ancient
[1:12:19] he said wherefore I was afraid and does
[1:12:21] not show you my opinion
[1:12:24] I said they should speak multitude of
[1:12:26] years should teach wisdom
[1:12:28] but there is a spirit in man
[1:12:31] oh no don't ever forget that church
[1:12:33] there what we want is inspired advice
[1:12:37] inspired counsel counsel that goes
[1:12:39] according to the word and that's why
[1:12:41] most of the counseling that we do
[1:12:42] although I'll be glad to talk to you
[1:12:44] anytime but a lot of the counseling we
[1:12:46] do is over the pulpit because it may be
[1:12:47] something I don't even know that's going
[1:12:49] on
[1:12:50] this morning I don't I'm not preaching
[1:12:52] this because I know something I'm
[1:12:54] preaching this because it's on my heart
[1:12:55] then if it's inspired to me there must
[1:12:57] be a reason for that and then if there's
[1:13:00] something in your heart that can receive
[1:13:01] that there's a spirit in man and the
[1:13:04] inspiration of the almighty giveth them
[1:13:07] understanding
[1:13:08] he said great men are not always wise
[1:13:11] neither do the aides to understand
[1:13:13] judgment
[1:13:14] therefore I said hearken to me I also
[1:13:16] will show my opinion
[1:13:19] oh we found that out lately in our
[1:13:21] country
[1:13:22] last two presidents been the oldest
[1:13:24] president but I challenge you to find
[1:13:25] anybody who said they were the wisest
[1:13:31] now maybe some of you but
[1:13:35] eliu is a type of Christ again
[1:13:38] and so he's interceding in this way and
[1:13:41] if you watch he doesn't condemn job but
[1:13:43] what does he do he points out he points
[1:13:46] out and he kind of lays a platform for
[1:13:48] what God speaks to job directly in the
[1:13:50] next chapter but there is value in age
[1:13:55] there is a value to that sometimes a
[1:13:58] person that's older can tell you some
[1:14:00] things
[1:14:02] in fact most of the time
[1:14:04] brother Branham talked about Tommy
[1:14:06] Osborne and I don't have time to go into
[1:14:07] all of it but Tommy Osborne was a young
[1:14:09] preacher and he heard brother Branham in
[1:14:11] those Portland meetings those powerful
[1:14:13] meetings where the man fell across
[1:14:14] brother around his feet you can find
[1:14:16] Tommy Osborne's testimony of those
[1:14:18] meetings on the internet on YouTube and
[1:14:21] Tommy Osborne was never a message
[1:14:22] believer but he was a he was one of the
[1:14:25] preeminent evangelists of that day and
[1:14:27] so he uh but he was a young man and he
[1:14:30] saw this happen and he comes to brother
[1:14:32] Brandon he says can I have a gift of
[1:14:34] healing but the random discourages him
[1:14:36] from that he said those things are
[1:14:38] god-given he said but every preacher is
[1:14:40] called to lay hands on the sick
[1:14:42] and so he told Tommy Osborne he said
[1:14:44] what I'd do he said is set up there
[1:14:47] under that old oak tree and learn all
[1:14:49] the tactics of Divine Healing by the
[1:14:51] word
[1:14:52] so in other words if I was going to go
[1:14:53] have healing meetings and I didn't have
[1:14:55] a gift of a prophet right it wouldn't
[1:14:57] mean I couldn't do it because we're all
[1:14:59] called to lay hands on the sick
[1:15:00] right but but he said sit under that old
[1:15:02] oak tree and learn to tell you he said
[1:15:04] well why didn't you just tell him to
[1:15:06] read his Bible because there was
[1:15:07] something that old oak tree had
[1:15:09] experienced what happens when the Bible
[1:15:12] when the word become reality
[1:15:14] right that old oak tree had not only
[1:15:16] seen the scripture that said I'm the god
[1:15:18] that heals all thy diseases but he'd
[1:15:20] seen those diseases healed and he knew
[1:15:22] how to transfer God that's what
[1:15:24] experience and wisdom is it's it's the
[1:15:27] understanding how to translate from the
[1:15:30] writing from the book into real life
[1:15:33] it's one thing to have it in the book
[1:15:35] book learning will only take you so far
[1:15:37] but there's another thing to actually
[1:15:38] know this is where it says I'm Healed
[1:15:41] but how do I get from A to B how do I do
[1:15:44] that that picks experience
[1:15:47] right and so and so he said go let's sit
[1:15:50] under that oak tree he said what old oak
[1:15:51] tree I said that one that's bald headed
[1:15:53] up there on the porch oh Dr FF Bosworth
[1:15:56] he said I believe he knows more about
[1:15:58] scriptural basis of Divine Healing than
[1:15:59] any man I know of in my life
[1:16:01] and so brother Tommy Osborne does that
[1:16:04] and and he goes overseas he has great
[1:16:06] campaigns and he comes back and tells
[1:16:09] brother Brandon he said brother Branham
[1:16:10] he said I'm glad I said under that old
[1:16:12] oak tree I said do you know he said it's
[1:16:15] still setting out there he said so now
[1:16:17] you've had great campaigns but you need
[1:16:18] to go back and learn some more
[1:16:20] he's I said he's going to Africa with me
[1:16:23] brother boss worth was right there at
[1:16:25] the time
[1:16:27] now am I boring you yet I hope I'm not
[1:16:30] there's some good stuff here but I've
[1:16:32] got to get to it and I'm trying to lay
[1:16:33] this Foundation because I it's just
[1:16:35] something I get to do as a pastor so you
[1:16:37] all humor me this morning
[1:16:40] so the term Elder is used in the New
[1:16:42] Testament for men like brother Bosworth
[1:16:45] right men older men who also had wisdom
[1:16:48] by their age not by just their age but
[1:16:51] their age in the Lord in first Timothy 5
[1:16:53] and 1 it says rebuke not an elder but
[1:16:55] entreat him as a father and the younger
[1:16:57] man is Brethren so in other words it's
[1:16:59] not that he's never wrong but when he's
[1:17:01] wrong there's a way to approach him
[1:17:03] right and and so now again that word
[1:17:06] Elder is is presbyteros which is older
[1:17:09] Elder presbyter a leader whose authority
[1:17:13] comes in principle from wisdom
[1:17:15] associated with age
[1:17:17] but it became the the head of the church
[1:17:19] or what we would call today the pastor
[1:17:21] become known as the pastor and it's used
[1:17:23] both ways in in the New Testament but
[1:17:25] Brown said Elder always has and always
[1:17:27] will refer simply to a man's
[1:17:30] chronological age in the Lord
[1:17:32] he is an elder not because he is elected
[1:17:34] or ordained Etc but because he is older
[1:17:38] right he is more seasoned trained not a
[1:17:41] novice reliable because of his
[1:17:43] experience now watch his experience and
[1:17:46] long-standing proof of his Christian
[1:17:49] experience so when you elect a pastor
[1:17:52] just in case you ever have to do it
[1:17:54] again you don't elect him to be an elder
[1:17:57] you elect an elder
[1:18:00] and that don't mean he's old
[1:18:02] right but it's his age in the Lord does
[1:18:04] he have a track record
[1:18:06] right what and what do you do with that
[1:18:08] track record
[1:18:10] you don't elect him to be an elder you
[1:18:12] don't make him an elder by electing him
[1:18:14] you elect an elder
[1:18:16] First Timothy three and one said this is
[1:18:18] a true saying if a man desire the office
[1:18:20] of a bishop there's another name for the
[1:18:21] same for the office for the Bible said
[1:18:23] the bishop was the office the Elder was
[1:18:25] who who held the office Bishop is the
[1:18:27] office of the Elder he said if he
[1:18:29] desires the office of a bishop he
[1:18:30] desires a good work and it goes on to
[1:18:32] give the qualifications I won't go
[1:18:34] through that this morning but in verse 6
[1:18:36] it says not a novice
[1:18:37] less being lifted up with pride he fall
[1:18:40] into condemnation of the devil what does
[1:18:41] the word novice mean now we've got young
[1:18:43] preachers here but they're not novices
[1:18:46] novice means newly planted
[1:18:49] what that means is a new Christian
[1:18:52] don't make a new Christian an elder
[1:18:54] a pastor and we could take it into this
[1:18:56] this sense don't seek counsel on on
[1:19:00] spiritual things from brand new
[1:19:02] Christians now if you want to ask them
[1:19:04] how they got their fire lit that's
[1:19:05] wonderful
[1:19:06] when you're talking about the word and
[1:19:08] how to overcome and those things talk to
[1:19:10] some of these men that have been doing
[1:19:11] it for decades talk to some of the even
[1:19:13] the young people that have been raised
[1:19:15] up in church and know and believe these
[1:19:17] things got saved at a young age so it's
[1:19:20] not not a newly planted man see a newly
[1:19:22] converted 70 year old man is an office
[1:19:26] right a 30 year old man who gave his
[1:19:28] heart to the Lord at a young age might
[1:19:30] be an elder
[1:19:32] right so that's not and brother Brown
[1:19:34] talks about it I don't have time again
[1:19:35] I've deleted a bunch of quotes today
[1:19:37] just to kind of just to kind of get
[1:19:39] through this but uh brother Brown talks
[1:19:41] about a man be one night in the bar and
[1:19:42] the next night singing in church and
[1:19:44] playing music he said you don't do that
[1:19:46] he calls it filth
[1:19:48] filth because you don't just you don't
[1:19:50] just do that but you watch somebody's
[1:19:52] life and see where they're at and what
[1:19:53] they're able to do are you with me this
[1:19:56] morning
[1:19:57] hey man do you love the Lord this
[1:19:58] morning
[1:19:59] hey man now again be careful how much
[1:20:02] advice you get from the newly planted
[1:20:04] find an elder to talk to you talked to
[1:20:06] somebody just got married they're going
[1:20:07] to give you
[1:20:08] advice on marriage
[1:20:10] but it's not going to be the same advice
[1:20:12] you get from somebody's been married 40
[1:20:13] years
[1:20:15] right and they do have advice to give
[1:20:17] but they're not going to have that depth
[1:20:18] of experience because they haven't been
[1:20:20] through as much
[1:20:22] right but you talked some of these
[1:20:23] people have been married 50 and 60 years
[1:20:25] my hat's off to you number one you
[1:20:26] lasted a long time to have been married
[1:20:28] for 60 years
[1:20:30] you've been on the earth a long time but
[1:20:32] if you if you've been married that long
[1:20:34] and uh Bill and sister Karen aren't here
[1:20:36] this morning but they they understand
[1:20:38] that some of you Elders you've been
[1:20:39] married a long time more than 50 years
[1:20:42] in some cases more than 60. you know
[1:20:44] that marriage is hard
[1:20:46] and you know what it's like to get past
[1:20:48] completely past the age of romance to
[1:20:51] the point where you're old and you're
[1:20:52] just taking care of each other and
[1:20:54] there's nothing in it for you
[1:20:57] you're just doing it for that other
[1:20:59] person
[1:21:00] but that's the best time there is
[1:21:03] because at some point you've got to
[1:21:04] reach that point where even when you're
[1:21:06] young it would be good to reach that
[1:21:07] point you're not doing it to get
[1:21:09] something you're doing it because you
[1:21:11] love that person so you get up and fix
[1:21:13] the breakfast in the morning or or help
[1:21:15] them out with the children or do
[1:21:16] whatever and vice versa and you're just
[1:21:18] barely able to get together forgive me
[1:21:21] brother JT but I know it takes you a
[1:21:22] while to get ready for church on Sunday
[1:21:23] morning and and I've thought about that
[1:21:26] you know it's an ordeal for some of the
[1:21:28] older folks to get ready and come to
[1:21:30] church and drive an hour to church and
[1:21:31] and be at the house of God it takes time
[1:21:33] and it would be a lot less effort just
[1:21:35] not do it let's just stream today but
[1:21:37] but they do it why do they do it because
[1:21:39] they want to set a good example and
[1:21:40] because they want to be in the house of
[1:21:42] the Lord
[1:21:42] right that's true yeah we ought to we
[1:21:45] ought to applaud people to do that
[1:21:47] some of you some of you have been
[1:21:49] through some things you it's hard for
[1:21:51] you to get out of bed in the morning
[1:21:52] physically maybe mentally but you come
[1:21:55] anyway why do you come
[1:21:56] oh God as I said Wednesday night that
[1:21:59] shows that you're a fish
[1:22:01] you got caught in the net and you
[1:22:03] weren't you didn't crawl back in the
[1:22:04] ocean you're a fish
[1:22:06] but you have a different perspective on
[1:22:07] life from somebody that that's Young and
[1:22:10] the young people have a different
[1:22:10] perspective because they're struggling
[1:22:12] with the kids
[1:22:14] right and they got a different
[1:22:16] perspective than you but you you've been
[1:22:17] there and done that
[1:22:19] but now you're fighting a different
[1:22:20] battle aren't you glad God's with you in
[1:22:22] that part of your battle too
[1:22:24] but so we don't want to get all of our
[1:22:27] advice from the newly planted
[1:22:29] we want to find an elder to talk to and
[1:22:30] whatever it is that we're seeking advice
[1:22:32] for
[1:22:34] after Solomon's Reign the people were
[1:22:36] upset about taxes that's happened all
[1:22:38] through history by the way people have
[1:22:41] always been mad about taxes
[1:22:43] and some of you are still mad about
[1:22:46] taxes
[1:22:47] I am too I'm right there with you I'm
[1:22:50] still paying off my taxes from last year
[1:22:52] now rehoboam asked his advisors remember
[1:22:55] who rehoboam is that's Solomon's son
[1:22:59] and I've been studying as you can tell
[1:23:00] from First Kings and second Kings and if
[1:23:03] you go into that and you begin to look
[1:23:05] at it he asked his advisors now he asked
[1:23:07] the men the old men now the reason why
[1:23:09] they had good advice is because they had
[1:23:11] been with Solomon his father
[1:23:13] they've been through it they didn't have
[1:23:16] good advice just because they were old
[1:23:17] but because they've been through the
[1:23:19] battle
[1:23:20] and that he asked the men that stood he
[1:23:23] said how should I answer the people
[1:23:25] and they spoken to him said if I love
[1:23:27] this answer
[1:23:28] if thou will be a servant
[1:23:32] unto this people
[1:23:34] these people are hurting these people
[1:23:36] have been over taxed Solomon overtaxed
[1:23:38] them to build the temple
[1:23:41] they got to the point where they'd just
[1:23:42] been worked like slaves because
[1:23:44] Solomon's building his house he's
[1:23:46] building the Temple he's building up
[1:23:47] Jerusalem he's got and there's always a
[1:23:48] price to pay
[1:23:50] somebody pays the price you come to
[1:23:51] church you go to a church and everything
[1:23:53] runs just smoothly and everything's so
[1:23:55] nice and the music you don't see what
[1:23:56] goes on behind the scenes to get it that
[1:23:59] way somebody made a sacrifice somebody
[1:24:02] put out some effort
[1:24:04] and so here these people would put out
[1:24:06] some effort and they hit the new pastor
[1:24:09] we could say the new king comes in and
[1:24:11] the old older men tell him said if
[1:24:12] you'll be a servant
[1:24:15] and we'll serve them and answer them and
[1:24:17] speak good words to them they will be
[1:24:19] thy servants forever
[1:24:21] just treat them right rehoboam
[1:24:24] that's wisdom talking
[1:24:28] but he wouldn't ask his young friends he
[1:24:31] said he forsook the counsel of the old
[1:24:32] men which they had given him and
[1:24:33] consulted with the young men that were
[1:24:35] grown up with him
[1:24:36] which stood before him he said unto them
[1:24:38] what council gives you that we may
[1:24:40] answer this people who have spoken to me
[1:24:42] saying make the Yoke which thy father
[1:24:43] did put Upon Us lighter and the young
[1:24:46] men that were growing up with him
[1:24:47] speaking to him saying thus shalt thou
[1:24:48] speak unto this people that spake unto
[1:24:50] thee the father thy father made our yoke
[1:24:52] heavy but make it thou eat lighter unto
[1:24:54] us thus shalt thou say unto them my
[1:24:56] little fingers shall be thicker than my
[1:24:57] father's loins
[1:24:59] what an expression
[1:25:02] he said now whereas my father did laid
[1:25:04] you with a heavy yoke I will add to your
[1:25:06] yoke loins was the strength of a man
[1:25:08] he's saying that he's saying I'm going
[1:25:10] to be heavier and stronger and and make
[1:25:13] you pay more taxes and be a harder
[1:25:15] disciplinarian than he was
[1:25:18] he said thy father made our yoke heavy
[1:25:19] even make it lighter I my little finger
[1:25:21] will be thicker than my father's voice
[1:25:22] now whereas my father delayed you with a
[1:25:24] heavy yoke I will add to your yoke my
[1:25:27] father had chastised you with whips but
[1:25:29] I will chastise you with scorpions
[1:25:31] imagine getting up and preaching that
[1:25:33] sermon
[1:25:34] he didn't have the heart of the people
[1:25:35] he was new
[1:25:37] right it was terrible advice
[1:25:41] and he lost 10 of the 12 tribes over it
[1:25:43] why did he take that advice though the
[1:25:45] advice of the elders because he'd grown
[1:25:46] up with these other men
[1:25:48] we got to be careful with that who do
[1:25:50] you want to ask for advice a Godly
[1:25:51] person
[1:25:53] amen the Bible says the thoughts of the
[1:25:56] righteous are right but the councils of
[1:25:58] the wicked are deceit
[1:26:00] the Bible says again in Psalms 1 1
[1:26:02] blessed is the man that walketh not in
[1:26:04] the counsel of the ungodly and that
[1:26:06] doesn't mean walk in a council
[1:26:08] c-o-u-n-c-i-l his counsel walketh not in
[1:26:10] the advice of the ungodly
[1:26:14] right nor standeth in the way of Sinners
[1:26:16] nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful
[1:26:18] you don't walk under the advice of the
[1:26:21] ungodly look look at ahaziah's
[1:26:24] counselors
[1:26:25] as I is again the king that we talked
[1:26:27] about that went down to be else above
[1:26:31] this is how Italia came to be the wicked
[1:26:33] Queen over Jerusalem it says 42 years
[1:26:36] old with a has I when he began to Reign
[1:26:37] he reigned one year in Jerusalem his
[1:26:39] mother's name was Italian the daughter
[1:26:40] of Omri
[1:26:42] remember they had married in
[1:26:43] intermarried between Judah and Israel
[1:26:45] said he walked in the ways of the House
[1:26:46] of Ahab for his mother
[1:26:48] was his counselor to do wickedly now
[1:26:51] we're coming back to the home and you
[1:26:52] think about it who is the best counselor
[1:26:54] and who can be the worst counselor
[1:26:57] the parents
[1:26:59] because they get all that time to spend
[1:27:01] with their children
[1:27:04] and tell them this is the right way and
[1:27:06] not just tell them but by actions
[1:27:08] show them what to do and what not to do
[1:27:12] his mother was his counselor to do
[1:27:13] wickedly wherefore he did evil in the
[1:27:15] sight of the Lord like the house of Ahab
[1:27:17] for they were his counselors after the
[1:27:19] death of his father to his destruction
[1:27:21] he walked also after their counsel and
[1:27:24] went with johoram the son of Ahab king
[1:27:25] of Israel the war against Hazel king of
[1:27:27] Syria Ramos Gilead and the syrians smote
[1:27:29] joram and he returned to be healed in
[1:27:31] jestro because of the wounds which were
[1:27:32] given him at Rhema and it tells the
[1:27:34] story and I I'm not going to read that
[1:27:35] next verse but it tells how because of
[1:27:37] that God used that occasion to cut off
[1:27:40] his house
[1:27:41] to cut off the house of Ahab be careful
[1:27:44] The Company You Keep be careful who you
[1:27:46] seek advice from but man who can I trust
[1:27:50] now let's bring it down a little bit
[1:27:51] closer as we get close to the end to
[1:27:53] this morning
[1:27:54] who can I trust
[1:27:57] and trust God
[1:27:59] that may seem simple but you can trust
[1:28:01] God
[1:28:02] look when when God came and expressed
[1:28:05] himself in flesh there were certain
[1:28:07] attributes that he was to be known by
[1:28:09] and those were expressed in Isaiah 9 6
[1:28:12] where he says For unto us a child is
[1:28:15] born unto us a son is given it's telling
[1:28:18] what he will be
[1:28:19] and now it's going to give his
[1:28:21] attributes of his divine nature that he
[1:28:23] had
[1:28:24] right these things come from God
[1:28:26] right and they were in him so you know
[1:28:28] that there was Jehovah crying in the
[1:28:29] manger and I won't go into the godhead
[1:28:31] this morning but if he wasn't God till
[1:28:33] later he wouldn't have been these things
[1:28:34] as a child
[1:28:35] but he was these things unto us a child
[1:28:37] is born unto us a son is given the
[1:28:40] government will be all upon his shoulder
[1:28:43] and his name Shall be Called wonderful
[1:28:47] counselor
[1:28:49] do you ever notice that it was just pick
[1:28:51] that out counselor
[1:28:54] oh God
[1:28:55] his name should be called and actually
[1:28:57] the King James puts a a comma there but
[1:29:00] if you look in some of the other
[1:29:01] translations they remove the comma
[1:29:02] because in the original it's one word
[1:29:04] wonderful counselor
[1:29:07] oh God wonderful counselor his name
[1:29:11] should be called wonderful counselor the
[1:29:13] Mighty God the Everlasting father that
[1:29:15] shows you that there's no three persons
[1:29:17] in the Trinity right there his name
[1:29:19] shall be Everlasting father the Prince
[1:29:21] of Peace
[1:29:23] wonderful counselor literally means a
[1:29:26] Wonder of a counselor
[1:29:29] a Wonder of a counselor the Hebrew word
[1:29:31] for wonderful indicates a phenomenon
[1:29:33] laying outside the realm of human
[1:29:35] explanation
[1:29:37] do you want to know who to talk to today
[1:29:39] and I'll help you all that I can I want
[1:29:41] to be a good pastor as long as God
[1:29:43] allows me to be here I want to be the
[1:29:44] best that I can be but don't you realize
[1:29:46] there's somebody you can go to that
[1:29:48] don't make any mistakes
[1:29:50] that never never messes up
[1:29:55] talk to me long enough you'll hear
[1:29:56] something that's wrong
[1:29:58] if I talk to you long enough I'll hear
[1:30:00] something that's wrong because you're a
[1:30:02] human being but he's a wonderful
[1:30:04] counselor
[1:30:05] a counselor Beyond explanation all
[1:30:08] that's who we need to go to today that's
[1:30:10] why we need the spirit of God in our
[1:30:12] services that's why we need him to be so
[1:30:14] present Among Us
[1:30:16] a wonderful counselor a Wonder of a
[1:30:18] counselor Beyond human explanation
[1:30:20] separated from the normal course of
[1:30:22] events when I would go one way but the
[1:30:25] spirit of God convicts me and pulls me
[1:30:27] back another Direction beyond my
[1:30:29] explanation beyond what I can figure out
[1:30:32] he's a wonderful counselor
[1:30:35] and sometimes he uses men to do that
[1:30:39] but it's his counsel now listen
[1:30:42] the Bible speaking of not of of Wonder
[1:30:44] like that Wonder wonderful Beyond human
[1:30:47] explanation in Psalms 139 6 it explains
[1:30:50] that such knowledge is too wonderful
[1:30:54] for me it's too high I cannot attain
[1:30:57] unto it this is not something I thought
[1:30:58] up
[1:31:00] he's a wonderful counselor this goes
[1:31:03] into the realm of the supernatural it
[1:31:04] goes beyond my human abilities and my
[1:31:06] human thinking you say well I want a
[1:31:08] pastor who can explain everything to me
[1:31:10] just try it and and I want to be that
[1:31:12] but listen no man is going to be able to
[1:31:15] do that perfectly but you do have an
[1:31:17] advocate with the father you do have the
[1:31:19] Mighty God that's been unveiled before
[1:31:21] us you do have the Holy Spirit in your
[1:31:24] life to be able to talk to you and that
[1:31:26] knowledge that he gives is beyond your
[1:31:27] understanding
[1:31:30] you can't dream that up
[1:31:33] we wouldn't dream that we'd been here
[1:31:34] today we'd have made the Rapture a lot
[1:31:36] quicker
[1:31:38] but the wonderful counselor
[1:31:40] had different advice
[1:31:43] think about it if you could have
[1:31:44] controlled everything in your own life
[1:31:46] you wouldn't be where you're at today
[1:31:47] and you might think it's a mistake for
[1:31:50] you to be at where you're at today
[1:31:52] oh God help us today you might think
[1:31:55] it's a mistake oh I made a mistake I I
[1:31:57] feel like I feel like I'm not
[1:31:59] comfortable but you don't realize that
[1:32:01] God puts you where you're at
[1:32:04] why it was his advice that put you there
[1:32:07] that lets you go through the things that
[1:32:09] you went through it's beyond your
[1:32:10] understanding you were sitting there one
[1:32:12] day he said now let me give you some
[1:32:13] counsel we'll we'll talk about this and
[1:32:15] no no but by your War by his word and he
[1:32:17] led you and by his Spirit he led you and
[1:32:20] he led you in ways that were
[1:32:21] incomprehensible to your own mind you
[1:32:23] would not have picked the route that it
[1:32:25] took to get here
[1:32:27] are you with me now very few people
[1:32:30] could look back in life and say well I I
[1:32:32] I wish I I don't see anything to correct
[1:32:35] but we can look back and say I wish I
[1:32:37] hadn't done that and I wish I hadn't
[1:32:38] gone there and I wish I hadn't started
[1:32:40] over this place and I wish I hadn't done
[1:32:42] made this mistake and I wish I hadn't
[1:32:44] made that commitment but don't you
[1:32:45] realize the wonderful counselor knew
[1:32:47] better than you did about your life and
[1:32:49] brought you to the place where you are
[1:32:51] today beyond your explanation beyond
[1:32:53] your ability to think about it
[1:32:57] said but I don't understand I had this
[1:32:59] sickness in my body and these things
[1:33:00] have happened to me and now I find
[1:33:01] myself in a different place wonderful
[1:33:04] counselor
[1:33:06] advised
[1:33:08] differently
[1:33:10] than what you would have advised
[1:33:12] are you with me now
[1:33:14] the Bible tells us that that's the Holy
[1:33:17] Spirit John 16 and 12 says I have yet
[1:33:18] many things to say unto you
[1:33:20] do you believe he's still speaking today
[1:33:23] Jesus told him he said I have many
[1:33:25] things to say unto you
[1:33:27] but you cannot bear them now he wanted
[1:33:30] to tell him about a Rapture he wanted to
[1:33:32] tell him oh my you want to tell him
[1:33:34] about all these things that Paul all
[1:33:36] these Revelations that the message of
[1:33:37] grace to the Gentiles we said you can't
[1:33:39] bear that now
[1:33:41] I would tell you these things you can't
[1:33:43] bear that now how be it when he the
[1:33:45] spirit of Truth has come he will guide
[1:33:48] you into all truth
[1:33:51] for he shall not speak of himself now I
[1:33:53] like this a real counselor is humble
[1:33:57] right if you find somebody that has all
[1:33:59] the answers you run
[1:34:01] a real counselor is humble he shall not
[1:34:03] speak of himself but whatsoever he shall
[1:34:05] hear that shall he speak he will show
[1:34:07] you things to come likewise the spirit
[1:34:09] also helpeth our infirmities I love this
[1:34:11] Romans 8 26 the spirit also helpeth our
[1:34:14] infirmities for we know not what we
[1:34:16] should pray for as we ought
[1:34:19] we know what we want but we don't always
[1:34:21] know what he wants
[1:34:24] right and many times in the word we'll
[1:34:26] look at it and we and we say well where
[1:34:28] is the word that fits my situation where
[1:34:30] you can't see it without the Holy Spirit
[1:34:33] so he has to reveal that to you and so
[1:34:36] the spirit helps our infirmities or our
[1:34:38] weaknesses
[1:34:39] for we don't know what we should pray
[1:34:41] for but the spirit wonderful counselor
[1:34:45] remember all that God was he poured into
[1:34:47] Christ all that Christ was he poured
[1:34:49] into the church in the form of the Holy
[1:34:51] Spirit
[1:34:53] right he's a wonderful counselor
[1:34:56] is that what he is so now he makes
[1:34:58] intercession for us
[1:35:01] with groanings which cannot be uttered
[1:35:04] and he that searcheth the hearts knoweth
[1:35:06] what is the mind of the spirit because
[1:35:08] he maketh intercession for the Saints
[1:35:10] according to the will of God somebody
[1:35:12] tell me what another name for a
[1:35:14] counselor is
[1:35:17] an attorney
[1:35:20] if you said attorney Pat yourself on the
[1:35:21] back if you can
[1:35:25] if you ever I can't so
[1:35:28] if you've ever if you've ever been in a
[1:35:30] court of law you know that that's how
[1:35:31] they address them in the court of law
[1:35:32] counselor
[1:35:34] counselor why they talk because they're
[1:35:36] there to advise the client they're not
[1:35:38] on trial they're there to advise the
[1:35:40] client but brother Branham comes along
[1:35:42] in the message of the hour and he tells
[1:35:44] us he said we need a counselor we need
[1:35:46] an attorney
[1:35:48] complete our case he said but actually
[1:35:51] the attorney and the judge amen it's a
[1:35:54] rigged Court they're the same person
[1:35:57] so the attorney gives you the right
[1:35:59] advice gives you the right words to
[1:36:02] testify gives you the things to say and
[1:36:05] tells you your innocent tells you you
[1:36:07] didn't do it in the first place tells
[1:36:08] you you're clean tells you your whole
[1:36:10] tells you you've been forgiven by the
[1:36:12] blood of the Lamb the attorney is
[1:36:13] speaking on your behalf he's a wonderful
[1:36:15] counselor
[1:36:17] oh my he's a wonderful counselor he
[1:36:21] shows you things to come he tells you
[1:36:23] this is what the judge does how can he
[1:36:25] know that he is the judge this is what
[1:36:28] pleases the judge how does he know that
[1:36:30] he is the judge
[1:36:32] Glory
[1:36:34] he knows what the judge wants yeah you
[1:36:36] think about a good attorney he don't
[1:36:38] just care about about what he has to say
[1:36:40] about just talking but he cares about
[1:36:42] everything even the appearance in the
[1:36:43] courtroom
[1:36:44] this judge he likes his people to wear a
[1:36:47] tie
[1:36:49] this judge he likes to be spoken to in a
[1:36:52] certain way
[1:36:53] I'm not saying that about God by the way
[1:36:55] you can wear a tie or not
[1:36:57] I want to start that Doctrine
[1:37:01] but you know
[1:37:03] he knows what the judge wants he's got
[1:37:06] it in his mind why he has familiarity
[1:37:09] but oh how much more our wonderful
[1:37:11] counselor
[1:37:12] knows what pleases the judge so he says
[1:37:15] this is how you should walk before him
[1:37:17] have you ever been convicted when you
[1:37:19] say something that was wrong you'd say
[1:37:21] something maybe a sharp to somebody and
[1:37:23] you feel that that conviction come over
[1:37:25] you what is that your wonderful
[1:37:26] counselor
[1:37:28] right he's coming to you he's beginning
[1:37:30] to talk to you and he's telling you
[1:37:32] don't say that don't write that don't
[1:37:33] type that don't don't send that letter
[1:37:35] or email or whatever it is you because
[1:37:36] that wonderful counselor what does he do
[1:37:38] he comes in and he begins to talk to you
[1:37:40] oh we'd be so much better off if we
[1:37:42] would listen to The Counselor if we'd
[1:37:44] listen to the attorney but that
[1:37:46] wonderful counselor comes in and tells
[1:37:48] us how does he know he is the judge he
[1:37:50] said the judge likes you to be at peace
[1:37:52] with one another the judge likes you to
[1:37:54] have Fellowship the judge wants you to
[1:37:56] be at peace in your home how does he
[1:37:57] know he is the judge
[1:38:00] Hallelujah
[1:38:02] and and again it doesn't mean that he
[1:38:04] won't ever use a teacher because brother
[1:38:05] Branham says that's his method
[1:38:08] he said we must come under teaching but
[1:38:09] the Holy Ghost Jesus men but remember
[1:38:11] it's the Holy Ghost not the man
[1:38:14] can I have five more minutes it's been
[1:38:18] I've been up here 55 minutes
[1:38:21] just in case you were wondering
[1:38:25] Joe Ash you remember looked up to
[1:38:26] Jehovah Diane when Jehovah passed away
[1:38:28] then he didn't know what to do
[1:38:33] Isaiah looked up to Uzziah in the same
[1:38:35] way it's backwards it was the prophet
[1:38:37] looking up to the king
[1:38:40] and he had to come to a time in his life
[1:38:43] that he realized there was a wonderful
[1:38:45] counselor
[1:38:47] that was Far Beyond his friend's uziah
[1:38:50] which had been a friendship of many
[1:38:52] years because I wasn't a young man
[1:38:54] by the way when he made his mistake
[1:38:58] there come a time you had to let go of
[1:39:00] that leadership and have an experience
[1:39:01] with God
[1:39:03] are you listening to me this morning
[1:39:06] you need to have an experience with God
[1:39:09] at some point you need you're going to
[1:39:11] have to let go of all human leadership
[1:39:14] and come face to face with God it
[1:39:16] doesn't mean again it makes you more
[1:39:18] willing to listen
[1:39:19] not less you'll still seek advice
[1:39:22] but you all the counsel in the world
[1:39:24] that I could give or other men or Elders
[1:39:26] could give to you would never help
[1:39:29] unless you've been in the presence of
[1:39:31] God
[1:39:33] because you won't follow the word your
[1:39:35] flesh doesn't want to
[1:39:37] unless you've been in the presence of
[1:39:40] God
[1:39:41] now watch second chronicles 26 tells the
[1:39:44] story of King Uzziah I won't read it all
[1:39:46] but the Bible says his name spread far
[1:39:48] abroad he'd done all of these things
[1:39:49] second chronicles 26 15 his name spread
[1:39:52] far abroad for he was marvelously helped
[1:39:55] till he was strong
[1:39:57] but when he was strong his heart was
[1:39:59] lifted up to his destruction
[1:40:01] for he transgressed against the Lord his
[1:40:03] God and went into the Temple of the Lord
[1:40:05] to burn incense upon the altar of
[1:40:07] incense without asking any advice
[1:40:10] and without having that wonderful
[1:40:12] counselor Uzziah walked into the holy of
[1:40:14] holies
[1:40:16] and Azariah the priest went in after him
[1:40:18] that was his job
[1:40:20] and with him four score Priests of the
[1:40:22] Lord 80
[1:40:24] priests that were Valiant men
[1:40:27] and they withstood inside of the king
[1:40:29] and said unto him in appertaineth not
[1:40:31] disease to burn incense unto the Lord
[1:40:34] haven't we seen what a mess it makes
[1:40:36] when businessmen invade the pulpit when
[1:40:39] people get out of their position
[1:40:41] right they weren't meant to do that
[1:40:44] don't go in there uziah you're a king
[1:40:47] not a preacher not a priest
[1:40:50] he said but 80 men stood against him but
[1:40:54] the he said it appertains not unto thee
[1:40:56] to burn any sense of the Lord but to the
[1:40:57] priests of Sons of Heron are consecrated
[1:40:59] to burn incense go out of the sanctuary
[1:41:01] for thou has trespassed
[1:41:03] can you imagine a priest trying to kick
[1:41:05] a king out of church
[1:41:07] he said but you don't belong in that
[1:41:08] position
[1:41:11] so you've given such bad advice you're
[1:41:14] setting such a bad example you got out
[1:41:16] of position
[1:41:18] huh
[1:41:19] oh God help us today
[1:41:21] and it says go out of the sanctuary
[1:41:24] you've trespassed neither shall be for
[1:41:25] thine honor from the Lord God
[1:41:27] then uziah was wroth and he had a sensor
[1:41:29] in his hand to burn incense and while he
[1:41:31] was Wrath with the priest while he was
[1:41:33] angry leprosy even rose up in his
[1:41:35] forehead before the priest in the house
[1:41:36] of the Lord from beside the incense
[1:41:38] altered leprosy is a type of Sin Sin
[1:41:41] come in his life
[1:41:42] and Azariah the chief priest and all the
[1:41:44] priests looked upon him and behold he
[1:41:45] was leprous in his forehead and they
[1:41:47] thrust him out from this yay himself
[1:41:49] hasted also to go out because the Lord
[1:41:52] had smitten him
[1:41:53] brother Brandon said when this man got
[1:41:55] lifted got stricken by the celebrities
[1:41:56] he got lifted up in Pride it was a great
[1:41:58] lesson to the prophet Isaiah he found
[1:42:01] out by this being a great lesson that
[1:42:03] God orders his man to the place
[1:42:05] man cannot order himself God orders his
[1:42:08] man is that right he's a wonderful
[1:42:10] counselor
[1:42:11] God makes you what you are God orders
[1:42:13] this man and he mustn't try to take
[1:42:15] another's place and it was a lesson to
[1:42:17] Isaiah he mustn't put his eyes upon
[1:42:19] human beings for an example he must put
[1:42:21] his eyes on God oh that's us this
[1:42:23] morning listen to what the prophet said
[1:42:24] he said now that's us
[1:42:26] we can Pitchfork over to somebody else
[1:42:28] but that's us this morning any man any
[1:42:32] man is subject to mistakes
[1:42:34] he is subject to error
[1:42:37] because he is human
[1:42:39] he is subject to the violations of God's
[1:42:42] laws he is subject to many things
[1:42:44] because Satan tempts him he is just a
[1:42:47] human being and if God ever lifted his
[1:42:49] hands he would fall
[1:42:51] and I've heard people say oh Satan can't
[1:42:53] do that yes you just let God lift his
[1:42:55] hand one time and Watch What Happens he
[1:42:57] said I constantly plead God don't send
[1:42:59] him
[1:43:00] have mercy on me oh shouldn't that be
[1:43:03] our call today and our desire to have
[1:43:05] the humility to ask for that counsel
[1:43:07] from God lord don't lift your hand off
[1:43:09] my life
[1:43:10] keep them away from me I need God's
[1:43:12] mercy he said we all need that
[1:43:17] Brandon I'm skipping past one here
[1:43:20] he said don't ever trust in some man
[1:43:22] I don't care who he is
[1:43:24] if he's a holy man if he's good there's
[1:43:25] no such thing he said there's no holy
[1:43:28] man there's no holy church there's no
[1:43:29] such thing it's a holy God not a holy
[1:43:31] man it's the Holy Ghost
[1:43:33] he said it's the Holy Spirit working in
[1:43:35] the man it's the holy God in the church
[1:43:37] he goes on he said the man will fail
[1:43:38] he's a failure to begin with
[1:43:40] anybody the very greatest of man fall
[1:43:43] don't never put your confidence to make
[1:43:46] some man your example look to God Christ
[1:43:48] is your example
[1:43:51] make sure that one of your many
[1:43:54] counselors is
[1:43:55] the awesome wonderful counselor
[1:43:58] are you with me now make sure he's a
[1:44:00] counselor and he's the main one
[1:44:03] amen he said God he said we finally
[1:44:06] taking his mind from his eye the king
[1:44:08] that he loves so well now watch he said
[1:44:10] Christ is your example he said the king
[1:44:12] that he loves so well from Uzziah he
[1:44:15] said he looked up and he saw what he
[1:44:16] must understand to be a prophet that God
[1:44:18] and God Alone rules in the lives of men
[1:44:21] and in his church
[1:44:24] Isaiah 6. that's what God wants to show
[1:44:25] us today God and God Alone rules in the
[1:44:28] lives of men and in his church
[1:44:31] and if you go to Isaiah 6 1 and I don't
[1:44:33] have time to go through all of it as I'm
[1:44:35] closing this morning in fact musicians
[1:44:37] can go ahead and come
[1:44:39] and and we'll pick it up and then take
[1:44:41] it a different direction tonight
[1:44:43] but in Isaiah 6 and 1 it says in the
[1:44:45] year that King Uzziah died I saw also
[1:44:47] the Lord
[1:44:48] sitting upon a throne high and lifted up
[1:44:52] what was God showing him
[1:44:55] here was Josiah taken down off his
[1:44:57] throne
[1:44:58] smitten with leprosy
[1:45:01] but now he comes into the vision in the
[1:45:03] house of the Lord he's so desperate to
[1:45:05] hear a word from God because this has
[1:45:07] happened and it's troubled his mind but
[1:45:09] brother random said he showed God showed
[1:45:11] him a vision he showed him he put him in
[1:45:12] his presence he took him right up to the
[1:45:15] throne room
[1:45:17] and he looked in the throne room and he
[1:45:19] saw not a man lifted up
[1:45:22] not a preacher not a song leader not a
[1:45:25] prophet
[1:45:26] but the Mighty God
[1:45:29] the king the Lord
[1:45:32] sitting upon a throne
[1:45:34] I enlisted up
[1:45:37] elevated above everything else oh that's
[1:45:39] what we want to make him today we want
[1:45:41] to lift him up we want to elevate him
[1:45:43] over everything
[1:45:45] he said in his train
[1:45:47] I've never noticed this before but it
[1:45:49] said his train filled the temple
[1:45:52] is trained filled the temple I've looked
[1:45:55] at that but I've wondered what was the
[1:45:56] point his train filled the temple think
[1:45:58] about it his clothing
[1:46:01] filled the temple there was no room
[1:46:05] for anybody else
[1:46:09] we've got to come to this place Church
[1:46:13] we're surrendered to him and then when
[1:46:15] we can see the holy ghost moving a man
[1:46:17] will listen to the man
[1:46:18] because it's the Holy Ghost and a man
[1:46:20] the holy ghost that let him have that
[1:46:22] experience the holy ghost that made him
[1:46:23] an elder the Holy Ghost in our wives
[1:46:26] are you with me the Holy Ghost and the
[1:46:28] mothers teaching the younger women
[1:46:29] that's what the Bible tells them to do
[1:46:31] the Holy Ghost and among us teaching one
[1:46:34] another well what is it it's the Holy
[1:46:36] Ghost there is no room for anyone else
[1:46:38] in the throne room of God there is no
[1:46:41] room
[1:46:42] for anybody else
[1:46:44] but God
[1:46:46] oh God
[1:46:48] the Bible says who have known the mind
[1:46:49] of the Lord who has been his counselor
[1:46:51] what was missing from that throne room
[1:46:52] every Earthly King is surrounded by
[1:46:54] counselors
[1:46:56] because they understood that they needed
[1:46:58] men who knew who knew about the economy
[1:47:00] men who knew about they needed a cabinet
[1:47:02] they needed a a privy Council they
[1:47:04] needed somebody that they could trust
[1:47:05] that would be on the inside of the
[1:47:06] inside they could tell them about the
[1:47:08] economy tell them about war prop them up
[1:47:11] because no man knows everything and so
[1:47:13] those Eastern Kings would have hundreds
[1:47:16] of counselors
[1:47:17] hundreds of counselors in fact when King
[1:47:20] Charles was had his head cut off by the
[1:47:22] English people his wife he brought from
[1:47:24] France she brought a thousand counselors
[1:47:28] the queen brought a thousand counselors
[1:47:30] from France
[1:47:31] to be a queen
[1:47:33] you think how many more the king had
[1:47:36] think about it they filled the place
[1:47:38] wherever you saw King his house was full
[1:47:40] the the palace was full but here was God
[1:47:43] in the temple of the Lord and his train
[1:47:45] filled the temple
[1:47:47] no room for any other counselors
[1:47:52] we don't generate counsel from the flesh
[1:47:55] we want counsel to come from the Lord
[1:47:59] amen because he knows
[1:48:01] what's in his mind you're on his mind
[1:48:03] he knows you
[1:48:05] he was there with you before you were
[1:48:06] born
[1:48:08] go ahead and start playing something if
[1:48:09] you would
[1:48:11] brother Brown tells you a story about an
[1:48:13] old guide you forgive me today I'm tired
[1:48:16] I I've done that to myself that's not
[1:48:19] your fault I I I'm physically mentally
[1:48:21] wore out
[1:48:23] but I just
[1:48:27] it just means so much to me when I begin
[1:48:28] to look into these things so I know it's
[1:48:31] been choppy
[1:48:32] but there was an old guide who was
[1:48:35] taking a man fishing he was taking him
[1:48:38] out in the ocean of course you know in
[1:48:39] the ocean it's scary at night
[1:48:41] they took him out early in the morning
[1:48:42] before the sun come up and he took him
[1:48:44] out and he said they just kept drifting
[1:48:46] towards the ocean
[1:48:48] slowly they kept drifting as the ocean
[1:48:50] pulled and the currents and the tide
[1:48:52] began to pull them out and and the man
[1:48:56] that was with him that was with the guy
[1:48:58] that was fishing brother said it was a
[1:49:00] it was a doctor that wanted to go
[1:49:01] fishing in the ocean and he said he
[1:49:03] began to get nervous and began to say
[1:49:06] well I I don't we need to go back in we
[1:49:09] need to use the ores we need to use the
[1:49:11] engine we're going to get lost out here
[1:49:13] we're going to be out in the middle of
[1:49:14] the ocean when he said he said wait your
[1:49:18] God had done this before
[1:49:20] he said just wait what was he waiting on
[1:49:23] brother said he's waiting on the sun to
[1:49:24] come up
[1:49:25] he said because in the light we'll know
[1:49:27] where we're at
[1:49:29] amen this wonderful counselor has come
[1:49:33] in our age and the sun has come up have
[1:49:35] we not been preaching on that on

[1:49:46] my you want counsel today you can find
[1:49:48] it in the message of the hour you can

[1:50:38] and be touched by a coal of fire off the
[1:50:40] altar
[1:50:41] let him be your wonderful counselor
[1:50:43] today
[1:50:45] and he'll he'll do it and you won't even
[1:50:47] know how it got done but somehow you'll

[1:50:52] have strength
[1:50:53] and it'll help your family and help your
[1:50:55] life
[1:50:56] is that wonderful counselor is there
[1:50:58] Heavenly Father
[1:51:00] Lord Jesus with these that are gathered
[1:51:03] here together Lord they they need that
[1:51:05] counsel
[1:51:07] they need that strength in their lives
[1:51:09] oh god
[1:51:10] oh Lord how we would we would reach down
[1:51:13] to each one of them if we could and help
[1:51:16] but Lord sometimes we don't know the
[1:51:18] words to say
[1:51:20] sometimes we don't stay away and I know
[1:51:21] there's many others like me that
[1:51:23] sometimes we don't stay away or refrain
[1:51:26] from talking because
[1:51:27] because we don't want to help but
[1:51:29] because we we know we don't have the
[1:51:31] right words
[1:51:33] we just don't know what to say
[1:51:35] but Lord when we enter your throne room
[1:51:36] we realize there is a wonderful
[1:51:38] counselor
[1:51:40] or that can reach down to the one who's
[1:51:42] been through the most
[1:51:43] and empathize with them a high priest
[1:51:45] that can be touched by the feeling of
[1:51:48] our infirmity
[1:51:49] I pray you'd help us to realize that
[1:51:52] today to recognize that if there's one
[1:51:54] here who's never received the baptism of
[1:51:56] the Holy Ghost I pray Lord that you'd
[1:51:57] help them not to rest until they had
[1:52:00] completely wrapped themselves Lord in
[1:52:02] your spirit that had come down on that
[1:52:04] seed and anointed it hard in such a way
[1:52:06] that it would come to life
[1:52:08] or if there's one that needs a refilling
[1:52:11] today Lord my hands are up today I need
[1:52:14] strength I need guidance Lord I pray
[1:52:16] you'd come this morning refill it so God
[1:52:19] make us put a fire in us to burn Lord
[1:52:23] and do the things that are right I
[1:52:25] prayed granted now we love you Lord
