there's one here that needs salvation i i know lord that you knew them before the foundation of the world you brought them to this place well then i pray that you would move in their lives today they would give themselves completely and holy unto you we pray in jesus name amen amen do you love him this morning isn't it good to be in the house of the lord amen we'll turn to first john chapter one we'll just read verse seven good to have everybody out in the house of the lord this morning and got some visitors this morning it's good to have you all with us and uh it's always good to see all of you some of you i i only get to see especially with the pandemic on and things going like they are and i only get to see you on sundays but it just brings such joy to our hearts to see your face and to know you're still in the battle you're still by the jp on the firing line and that means something to see you here and we thank you for coming amen first john chapter 1 and verse 7 but if we walk in the light as he is in the light we have fellowship one with another and the blood of jesus christ his son cleanseth us from all sin amen what a promise that is this morning you may be seated lord at his blessing to the word i'm going to be speaking some from the lord willing from a message brother branham preached december 30th 1962 and then he preached it several times on the absolute and we'll be taking some scriptures and things and today kind of a precursor to that but i encourage you to listen or read that sermon if you get a chance there's several reasons why we'll have someone preach for us here thank you brother danny i appreciate that i appreciate good deacons taking care of me i'm taking care of all of you as well there's several reasons i'll let someone bring a message from the pulpit here the main reason because i believe they'll help you and i we've had a couple of ministers in lately and i believe that they've been a help to the congregation and and it's completely different styles but god uses evangelists god still has teachers god still uses different parts of the fivefold ministry to bless the bride and we thank god for that and and but it got me thinking about some things and and there may be times you wonder why i let someone preach sometimes you wonder why i preach i'm sure but i've told someone i don't preach in spite of this message i preach because of this message and you know and and we find we have different ministries in and i believe they're a benefit to the bride of christ that's the main reason i believe that our ministers here but the spirit brother allen are a help to the body of christ and so i want to give them opportunity whenever i can but the steward will be preaching wednesday night i want to give them opportunity while they're able to to preach for us and they'll preach other places as well another reason why i would have someone preach sometimes is to help the preacher and that's to give an opportunity especially to a young minister to preach because how are they ever going to learn how to stand on the pulpit and deliver the word of god it's a fearful thing to stand in the pulpit and deliver the word of god i still tremble when i walk into the pulpit after all these years and so i know that uh i want you got to give them time for that gift to grow and so we want to do that when we can and the other reason is brotherly kindness or respect we would have someone preached sometimes out of brotherly kindness maybe they wouldn't be the best preacher in the world but it would be but john's good to have you today as well good to see you here and but we'd have just someone because we respect them or brotherly kindness and that's a valid reason to have someone preach because we can be a help you realize you're a help to the preacher this congregation has been such a help to me and and it means a lot to have you here and and to be able to see you but even those that are watching when i can see that you're watching i i appreciate that i it means a lot to me disfellowship is not a badge of honor there is no crown that is given out for not fellowshipping for being the person that was the least fellowship person in the world or in the message and sometimes we act like it is and i say we i use that term loosely i know you're a friendly church and we're a friendly church but but you know we'll sometimes people will uh disfellowship from brothers over something that they both believe the same message they both believe the same bible but they'll disfellowship over something that is uh really minor and you have to be able to invite to divide those things that's part of rightly dividing the word but they'll take something and every word of god is essential but the random told us that but only the word of god is essential so it makes sense to my opinion about the word of god is not essential but every word of god is essential so this fellowship's not a badge of honor doesn't mean there was no messenger that wanted to cut himself off from the denomination of the group that he was in he was forced out always because he preached the truth and if someone is going to leave let it be because we stand for truth not because we just were rude or or because we had some little difference about something that we both believe the same message but there's some little idea that we have that we can't even back up with the word and they can't either why would we dis-fellowship over that right there would be no reason to do that and so we try not to disfellowship with people if there will be a i don't know if the crowd when the crowds are given out if there'll be a crown for fellowshipping but it's much more likely than there being one for disfellowshipping john wesley said it this way he said i want the whole christ for my savior the whole bible for my book and the whole church for my fellowship and the whole world for my mission field we should never be unfriendly there's no excuse for that i've been to message churches that where no one greeted you at all you go to church and show up no one shook your hand no one acknowledged you were there then you leave that didn't hurt my feelings it's just wrong because we should love to see one another and if you know i heard a story about a man who was traveling overseas and he's in south korea and where philip is and he was traveling through south korea there's a lot of christian people there and as he was traveling he sat down at a bus stop and a man sat down beside him had a bundle wrapped up in his hand and he started speaking to him in korean and the man only knew one line of korean and that said i don't understand korean and so he told him that and he just kept trying to talk to him trying to talk to him and finally he looked at him and he said jesus in korean whatever that would be and he understood that he said yes yes he pointed the man he had a korean bible and he pulled it open and he come to the scripture where it says that by this shall we know that oh that you're my disciples the world will know that you're my disciples because you have love one for another. by this shall all men know it and so they had fellowship there on the bus stop even though they were from different countries and spoke different languages but they had something in common something in common and so we've got something in common today and yet the greatest deception the world will ever know is based around fellowship that's the doctrine of balaam right it says we're all the same we're not all the same right so there are essentials to what we believe there's things that we believe that we have to stand on there's things we believe and i got thinking about that and i thought you know there's some things that we we have to believe in order to have any kind of real fellowship and we believe in the inerrancy of scripture we believe that the word of god is true that this bible is the inerrant word of god we believe that we believe in the deity of jesus christ jesus christ is god now that may seem like a simple thing but even in message circles sometimes they get people get away from that that's something we can fellowship around the deity of jesus christ aren't you glad he's god and we're not amen we believe in atonement by christ alone he's the only one there's one lamb right we believe in atonement by christ alone that he is the lamb and we believe in justification by faith alone those are the essential doctrines of the reformation soul of scripture which is the the scriptures alone uh sola christus i believe it is in christ alone we believe in christ as the sole atonement for our sins his death burial and resurrection we believe in rapture and resurrection now you you may say have a little bit different idea about it than i do but we believe in it we can fellowship around that around the fact that we're going to change brother david we're not going to be these whole bodies forever but jt we're not going to be hobbled forever we're going to be in new bodies one of these days we can fellowship around that fact that's a real thing we can grab a hold of we believe in personal and practical holiness we believe in that sanctification in our lives we believe in that and not that we would take somebody and judge somebody but if you come and tell me that something's going on in your life that's against the word of god i have to tell you it's not right because we believe in personal and practical holiness that it ought to show up in our lives that what's on the inside ought to show up on the outside and so if you if you're a church that never preaches holiness you're there's not going to be much we can fellowship around you understand because you go and we were watching some worship music the other night and and not i don't want to be critical god forgive me if i'm critical but but people stand up there in high heels and and tight skirts and or it was actually pants and you have to look away i enjoy some of the music but i hate the way they look and i got to looking at that and i thought there's no fellowship there i couldn't even sit there and listen to that i it just it grieves my heart because it just it creates this disfellowship and i'm so thankful that we can come to the house of god today and and have musicians that love god and singers that love god and people that love god amen and loving enough that it shows up in a practical way in their lives not not that we'll be perfect because again we believe in one atonement right for sin that's it but we believe in in personal and practical holiness we believe in baptism by immersion in the name of the lord jesus christ we believe that's what the scriptures teach us if the scriptures are inerrant then we believe that's the truth we believe in the baptism of the holy ghost do you believe in that today that didn't leave the church right an intellectual conception of the message doesn't replace the baptism of the holy ghost so we believe in that we believe in gifts in the church we believe in ministry gifts and spiritual gifts we don't teach cessation and it would be hard to have fellowship with those that believe in cessation because they don't believe that what i do is it's valuable and they don't believe what we do as a church is valuable but and it's not just me but ministry as a whole we believe if god put it in the church he didn't take it out right and so we believe in in the gifts we believe ministry and we believe in spiritual gifts we still believe in tongues and interpretation and knowledge and helps and all of those things amen brother branham did we we do and why you say what do you say brother branham did well because he was a word prophet right so we believe we have to have some doctrine and we're not a church and yet we treat people right who don't believe that right that's no excuse to be rude to somebody who don't believe these things right we believe in the sovereignty of god an election and predestination right that takes all the worry off of me and all the worry off of you right yes we strive but we strive because there's something on the inside that's calling us to another land we strive because we were preordained to it amen we believe in the sovereignty of the local church if someone teaches a denominational system where there's a bishop that we have to answer to we can't have much fellowship around that we believe in the restoration and the opening of the word by god's prophet messenger to this age brother branham again we don't treat you bad if you don't believe that but that's what we believe as a fulfillment of malachi 4 as a fulfillment of revelations 10 1-7 his ministry during his ministry that was fulfilled god fulfilled it through that ministry we believe in the opening of the word we believe in the opening of the mysteries of god the tying up of the loose sins that covers all of the different doctrines of the message we believe in those things now you may have a little bit different idea but we can still fellowship around those things we believe in divine love and brotherly kindness we believe in that i want to ask us today just we kind of go through that and just kind of as we're preparing ourselves in it like i said if the lord's willing i i want to get into this absolute a little bit and what is fellowship fellowship in the original language is corninea which is a greek word that means common it's the idea of sharing having something in common a relation between individuals which involves a common interest and a mutual active participation in that interest and in each other thank you for putting up with my stutters but it's fellowship it's a common interest you've got to have something in common and so brother random tells the story about the little girls were hanging around grandma all the time he said she must have some candy in her pocket you do things keep your grandma around you know but or you do things keep your grandkids around i guess but you know that's if a person you know they like to fellowship with people with their own kind people they have something in common with who has more in common than we do no one does even our own family by blood we don't have more in common i have more in common with my brother as my brother in christ than i do as my brother in the flesh right now so we have a mutual active participation and interest and fellowship is not always fun right although though it pleases us and i believe it pleases god but but it's not always fun you don't look at fellowship in the bible and find where it was ever fun it was a fellowship of suffering we'll get into that a fellowship of the believers and things but it was not fun but it's a it's a participation in something something that you believe something that you stand on so it's not just we we call that a fellowship hall it's a place for fellowship this is a place for fellowship but this we we fellowship with the word here so we can fellowship with each other out there right and but we have a common interest even here now so the word answers to the latin communio which means your community it's common it's rendered in the scriptures communion you know that is fellowship communion is fellowship fellowship between you and god and fellowship with one another you realize the last thing jesus wanted to do was get his disciples together and have a meal just have a meal with them and he said do this till i come and we don't eat a full meal but we honor that it's death burial and resurrection by communion we fellowship with one another we long for that i've found over the years that people if they don't show up for any other service will show up for communion because there's just something about it it's a fellowship something we have in common every one of us take the same bread and the same wine right it's a fellowship that we have and so paul talks about your fellowship in the gospel of participation in sympathy and suffering and labor and sometimes it even talks about fellowship and uses the word fellowship for a gift that would be given from to people in need it's a fellowship we care for one another social media today is a poor substitute for real fellowship and you know if that's the only fellowship that we get it's virtual and i feel for our elderly because some of them that's all they can get right now and thank god we have that for them but if that's all that we get we're missing something there's something about being in the house of god that just does something to you you slow down and your week stops for just a minute you may be thinking about all kinds of things and worried about the tractors or whatever it is that you're concerned about in your everyday life but on sunday morning or wednesday night or whatever you can come you come in the house of god and you there's just something about it that it it breaks up that that idea and your thoughts begin to turn toward god and you begin to think lord i know i have needs i know my family has needs what does it do it just it creates a peace in your life it creates an expectation of coming together and receiving from god you don't get that god instituted it do you realize why we have church that's why we don't cease having church suddenly for no reason i read where i know and i'll do everything i can to keep us safe whether it's snow and ice or virus or whatever but and the deacons work for that diligently as well but but we need to meet together and i saw where the presbyterian church in in scotland i believe it is was suing their country which was a historically christian nation in fact i believe presbyterianism is the official religion of scotland still but they they had to sue the government because they've shut them down completely they can't even meet in small groups together after after thousands of years of meeting together through plague and everything else and they can't meet today and and that's not a political commentary but i looked at that and i thought why do you want to meet because why do we meet because jesus said that's enough right that ought to be enough that's something we can fellowship around jesus said if any two of you agree on one thing amen we can find at least one thing we agree on if any two of you will agree on one thing he said you ask it in my name it'll be done for you and he said where two or three are gathered in my name i will be in the midst thereof hey man what a promise that is to us hallelujah so the bible speaks the fellowship in acts chapter 2 verse 42 and they continued steadfastly in the apostles doctrine and fellowship they didn't just receive christ and then leave right but they continued steadfastly in the fellowship and then breaking a bread and in prayers first corinthians 10 16 the same word it's the cup of blessing which we bless is another communion that's the same word fellowship of the blood of christ the blood bread which we break isn't not the communion of the body of christ the fellowship second corinthians 13 14 the grace of the lord jesus christ and the love of god and the communion of the holy ghost aren't you glad to be able to have fellowship with him today the communion of the holy ghost he said be with you all hebrews 13 and 16 here's where it's used in a financial sense he said but to do good and to communicate to fellowship to care for one another forget not for with such sacrifices god is well pleased brother bosworth told brother branham that fellowship was like two fellows in one ship that's the idea of being in the same boat what that means is that you fellowship around the journey right if you've ever traveled much you know that that you fellowship around that journey you get two preachers who travel to different countries they'll immediately begin to fellowship around those journeys that they've taken if you find yourself in an airport or sitting on a plane next to somebody you find yourself fellowshipping with that person why because you you fellowship in the journey listen we're on a journey we're going somewhere for the job there's some place that we're going we're not stuck here if we were as paul said we were of all men most miserable if we don't believe in a resurrection and a rapture we're of all men most miserable but we believe we're going somewhere and so we fellowship around the journey there's a journey going on there's a there's a something that god is doing and taking us somewhere and so we fellowship around the commonalities of that oh there may be some things we do a little different you may be in a different part of the ship but we're in the same boat right we should be able to fellowship with that there's fellowship and suffering especially suffering for christ in philippians 3 10 paul says this he said that i may know him and the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of his sufferings being made conformable unto his death i can't suffer for myself but i can fellowship in his sufferings when i suffer then i fellowship in his sufferings now look the early church was a model of that can you imagine coming together maybe for communion as they would perhaps weekly would come together and on the first day of the week which was the historic practice of the church they come together it was illegal during that time together now that that was a you know we look at that time and the early that roman empire was during the pax romana during the two or three hundred years that rome had peace but they had peace by enforcing it and it was a wonderful empire to live in unless you were a jew or a christian and they had lots of abilities in fact historians will still argue today that it was the best time to ever be alive if you were a roman citizen but if you were a slave or somebody like that you'd be in trouble but if you were a roman citizen it was a wonderful time but they would gather together and i read a study that they did on the composition of the early church and there would be there would be some all different kinds set together but usually they would gather in the home of someone who was a citizen of someone who had a little money because he had to be able to host these people and feed them so it wasn't like we'd come together in a church because there wasn't any churches at the very beginning it was just we go to joe's house and he'd have enough money because he worked at the funeral home i don't know if they had funeral homes in that day but he just had enough to be able to make it probably and maybe a little extra where he could feed people that came and there would be slaves there there would be slave owners there would be people of many different ethnicities there would be jews there would be usually in every service they said there was a couple of homeless people there was always people there from different walks of life and the average group was no more than 30. how we got that beat this morning almost every service we gather together we do more than that but that's the average of the early church because as it spread they just kept planting more churches they didn't all just stay in one place until rome got started right they just planted churches in their own community and so they would gather together maybe in the catacombs as the persecution come on they would gather together and sit on concrete slabs or stone slabs they would sit together and can you imagine what the prayer request must have been like because brother so-and-so is missing this morning he got his head chopped off sister so and so she was with us last week but today she's awaiting trial they're going to take her and and torture her in front of her chill or torture her children in front of her and then torture her to death brother so-and-so was fed to the lions this week let's keep his family in prayer you talk about fellowship of suffering we suffer in our own way right but it's a different today it's a mental thing right it's an oppression of the mind and it's no less real to us but to them you imagine what it was to sit there you say see i don't take this lightly i don't take history lightly i'm standing in a long line of ministers who preach the light of their hour the light of their day we don't shouldn't take that lightly gathering together as a church we have a responsibility to keep it open keep the doors open keep the keep as many of us as we can gathering together why because that's what they've done for thousands of years he said do this until i come he said as you see the day approaching gather more together and more as much as you can if we could put it like that and so we're doing that we're trying to get together and to fellowship together but can you imagine the fellowship of that suffering that's what paul's talking about i'm in the fellowship of that i suffer too i've seen it overseas i've seen where the people just had so much fellowship and joy around each other because that's all they had and so many times we get that taken away from us maybe because of we let things slip in our lives to take away from our fellowship we don't realize how important it is especially our fellowship with god pray for brother james's family herod decapitated him today pray for brother peter he's in prison tonight awaiting execution they had such a prayer meeting that the prison come open an angel come down and let him out of the prison come knocked on the door and they thought he was a ghost you get to go through some things just start praying you get to go through some things god will begin to move in your life when brother david got sick we began to pray other people got sick and things begin to have we begin to pray and we begin to see miracles you can't see any miracles that there's never any problems you can't see any miracles that there's never any situation but as the pressure comes down as the demonic pressure of this age comes down we are led more and more to the to the word of god and to love one another and to fellowship with one another there's something wrong if we don't want to do that no wonder they prayed without ceasing brother branham talked about his own church and he's talking about them during the time of the depression when that church was started was during the time of the depression and how that they would greet one another and how they would love one another he said that's what this church was established upon that godly brotherly love for one another i've seen them even shake hands with one another leaving a place and cry like babies to leave one another they loved one another that well they loved one another there's a song called blessed be the tithe that binds brother madam like to sing it it's old song it's kind of hard to sing but they used to sing it together and and that song was written because a minister in england was about to leave a country church that he labored in for a few years and he was going to a big church in london he's about to leave and and the people gathered together all the whole church got together you know how small churches can be you love one another if something happens it just breaks you you understand because you have intimate fellowship with one another in a way that you just don't have in a big church and the church got together and they just began to weep and to cry not that they weren't begging him not to go they understood but they it was just such a love for him and and finally he just started crying and weeping he said i can't do it i can't go and so he finally just stayed there and that he wrote that song best be the pie that binds our hearts in christian love because it does something it won't even make sense sometimes it'll make you do things that don't make financial sense or or anything else because you love one another he said they love one another that well they love one another they love one another we used to stand and sing that old song let's be the tie that binds our hearts and christian love the fellowship of kindred mind is like to that above when we ascend apart it gives us inward pain but we shall still be joined in heart and hope to meet again he said let not that spirit ever depart from this place said if it ever does i don't care how eloquent your pastor might be how well he might bring the word of god the spirit of god is grieved away see when we can have all things in fellowship in common and love one another then god will work with us he said and we're keeping time and so brother branham types the church to a time piece a watch a clock he said we're keeping time that the people come by and say if you want to see a church that's really humble a church that really loves god drop in up there at the tabernacle one time and watch them look at the care they have for one another the respect when the gospel is being preached how reverent everything is just in order he said yes then they can look and see what time we're living amen why because they see us working together right the parts of the clock working together and they can look and see what time we're living you'll see the spirit of god moving among you great signs and wonders don't you want to see that he said that's when you're working together you'll see the spirit of god moving among you great signs and wonders things will be taking place if the thing is working together it's telling the time but if it isn't working then time is stopped it won't tell the time no more he said so if we want to know what time we're living just start everybody working together in the gospel loving one another can we do that this morning loving one another loving god and the hands itself will tell the time that we're living in how do we have fellowship how do we have fellowship we have fellowship with each other because we have fellowship with god what does he say if we walk in the light as he is in the light we have fellowship one with another all right and i know i've preached about a lot of these things before but then we're going to take a little bit different direction so just hang with me this morning but the fellowship is with him first vertical fellowship before horizontal fellowship in order to have real horizontal fellowship you've got to have vertical fellowship and usually now this isn't always the case there's always an exception but usually when you see someone leave horizontal fellowship and i don't mean just leave this church but leave church all together you see someone leave the fellowship we have as a body it's usually because they've already left the fellowship they have with god i've seen it over and over again i can't see i say how many times brother says fellowship is when we can come together now you can't make like crows and doves they can't have fellowship one with another he said their diet is different their habits are different he said you have to have fellowship as long as you're in an agreement as long as you're in an agreement first john 1 1 says that which was from the beginning i may have left you behind there that which was from the beginning or i may have failed to put these on there which we have heard which we have seen with our eyes which we have looked upon and our hands have handled of the word of life now watch that was from the beginning what we've heard what we've seen what we've looked upon our hands have handled of the word of life that's christ for the life was manifested and we have seen it and bear witness and show unto you that eternal life which was with the father and was manifested unto us that's not an ordinary man that's god that's a manifestation a logos the word of the father right you can say it this way jesus is what god said and jesus is what god did and jesus is who god is all right i've contemplated that deeply this week jesus is what god said jesus is what god is and jesus is he's the manifestation of god and he's who god is now everything that we have is based on every fellowship we have is based on fellowship with him watch what he says that which we have seen and heard we declare unto you that you also may have fellowship with us so he says we declare this gospel so we can have fellowship with you huh it don't mean that we don't treat you well when we have no fellowship but we declare the gospel because we want deeper fellowship we want beyond just as the brother was talking about but jason was talking about sunday that filia was more when spoken of in the scriptures was more than just a a love that you'd have for a natural brother but it's that deep affection of brotherly kindness and brotherly love we want that fellowship with one another so if you want to have fellowship with one another you've got to have fellowship with god watch what he says he says in verse 3 he says that which we have seen and heard declare we unto you that you also may have fellowship with us and truly our fellowship is with the father and with his son jesus christ that's where our fellowship is with and he said these things we write unto you that your joy may be full this then is the message which we have heard of him and declare unto you god is light and in him there's no darkness at all if we say that we have fellowship with him and walk in darkness we lie and do not the truth and people say well i just it's hard for me to go to church because i'm always so convicted we're getting fellowship with god you ought to be convicted in church if you're walking in darkness right and if you are thank god for that so many people aren't but if a person walks in darkness in their life of course they're either going to get better they're going to they're going to leave they won't usually stay around unless their heart is just hardened to it and so sometimes a person leaving is not always a bad sign because they have conviction but if they're one of god's they'll come back and they don't again they don't have to come to this church but they'll come to the house of god somewhere because that's what christians do so he said he said if this sin is the message which we have heard of him and declaring you god is light and in him it's no darkness at all if we say that we have fellowship with him and walk in darkness we lie and do not the truth we lie and do not the truth but if we walk in the light as he is in the light we have fellowship one with another now what's he saying if we walk in the light it's impossible for us to not have fellowship one with another fellowship is not something we perform or something we make ourselves do we have fellowship right as a result of having fellowship with him we have fellowship one with another as i've said no one exists outside the church if you think of the church there's a church nominal we know but the church spiritual the bride no one exists by themselves outside of that if you're someone that doesn't go to church at all you're just a part of the body that doesn't work right we like to have you back or wherever you belong they like to have you right because you belong somewhere but if we have if we walk in the light of jesus night we have fellowship one with another and the blood of jesus christ his son cleanseth us from all sin you don't realize the power that there is in keeping the church clean in the church gathering together right the power that's in the church that's why we talked about taking someone out from under the protection of the church what that means is there is protection in the church there is protection and gathering together you are protected by the prayers of the local congregation you're protected even beyond that but david we saw that but you're protected beyond that by the prayers of others people of light precious faith like the bible says he says if we say that we have no sin we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us we need to recognize that we need the atonement of jesus christ you believe that today but if we confess our sins i love this he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from how much from all unrighteousness all unrighteousness and what does that do it restores fellowship here and restores fellowship here it has to that's why you can't hold something against somebody that's repented you just have to let it go let god deal with that let god deal with that you you you have to embrace that and and keep going he said how many times should you forgive your brother seventy times seven not just seven times but over and over and over again you forgive them you forgive them until you don't even remember what the problem was wouldn't you like to be a forgiver like that you forgive them so many times that you don't even remember what you were forgiving them for amen he said if so if we've not sinned if we say we've not said we make him a liar his word is not in us in other words we're all in the same boat we need christ dietrich bonhoeffer spoke about this and he was a theologian in the german nazi era who actually worked against him was killed by the germans and worked against that nazi regime he was a wonderful writer and preacher and he said this the sinner surrenders he gives up all his evil he gives his heart to god he finds the forgiveness of all of his sin and the fellowship of jesus christ and his brother the expressed acknowledged sin has lost all its power i love this it has been revealed and judged just sin listen i didn't put this on the sides but i think it's worth reading he said it can no longer tear the fellowship asunder sin confessed loses its power to disfellowship you from christ and because of that loses its power to disfellowship you from the church hallelujah so i can't hold anything against you that god doesn't hold against you amen amen why because if we walk in the light as he is in the light the blood of jesus christ cleanses us from all sin amen listen it has been revealed and the sin has been revealed and judged as sin it can no longer tear the fellowship asunder now the fellowship bears the sin of the brother he is no longer alone with his evil for he's cast off his sin and confession handed it over to god it has been taken away from him now he stands in the fellowship of sinners who live by the grace of god at the cross of jesus christ the sin listen the sin concealed separated him from fellowship right though he may have been went to church but he couldn't have that fellowship because he'd broken fellowship with god you might tell me oh i feel more like a christian than i ever have if you've denied the word turned away from me i'm not talking about some little interpretation we have i'm talking about the word of god the plain teaching of the word you deny that turn away from it you tell me oh i feel more like christian you're under a deceived spirit you've been deceived by a spirit brother brandon talks about it and why it's so hard for some people to live the christian life hidden life with christ and all those sermons where brother adam talks about deceit church by the world all kinds of different sermons where he talks about how a person could be deceived because they feel the presence of god and it's only on the exterior because you have to have fellowship with him before you can have fellowship with one another god help us today george i don't say that and look at you say that look at me god help me not to ever be deceived let me stay right with the word because i know if i can stay right with the word i can stay right with you even if i make mistakes whatever you might make mistakes but yet you come back to the word and you repent and it's all covered under the blood and you restore fellowship here and here now to have true fellowship with one another so for us to do that we must be born again bonhoeffer said the sin concealed separated him from the fellowship made all his apparent fellowship a sham the sin confessed to help him to find true fellowship with the brethren in jesus christ paul says this he said be not unequally yoked together with unbelievers for what fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness well communion hath light with darkness you've got nothing in common what agreement he said what concord hath christ with belial what part hath he that believeth with an infidel what agreement at the temple of god with idols someone come in here and set up an idol up here and say y'all have your servants will have ours oh let's fellowship brother they can't do that brother that breaks my heart but i can't have fellowship around that idol i have no communion with that i understand i'm no community i can't fellowship around that whatever idol that is i can't fellowship around it people make idols today and they break off festival degrees in my heart but they make an idol out of a doctrine and that doctrine becomes the idol they worship around and if people worship they just worship around the idol and everybody comes and the preacher sets up the idol and they all worship around it and there's no fellowship it becomes a cult because what agreement hath the temple of god with idols for you are the temple of the living god god has said i will dwell in them and walk in them and i will be their god they should be my people so he says if you're the temple what agreement do you have with idols you have no agreement with idolatry he says what he said wherefore come out from among them be separate says lord touch not the unclean thing and i will receive you i will be a father unto you you should be my sons and daughters don't you want to have a father something that is a need in the heart of a human being for a father he said i'll be a father to you if you've dealt with that maybe in your life where you had not had a father that was a real father but he said i'll be a father unto you you should be my sons and daughters saith the lord god amen said the lord almighty what do we fellowship around what do we fellowship around i'm not going to keep you here until 12 30 today i recognize i'm not a special speaker but what do we fellowship around are you with me fellowship requires agreement agreement requires something what does it require absolute right there has to be a definition of wood somewhere or you're never going to agree with me that this pulpit is made out of wood if the definition of wood is based on your truth or my truth we got a problem all right i said well you believe whatever you want to no i have to we have to have some agreement or you're never going to use the right tools to work on it you're never going to you're not going to realize the strengths of it and the weaknesses of it you're not going to know anything about it unless you can first acknowledge it's wood right and so there has to be something that's absolute as long as adam and eve kept god's revealed word as an absolute they could have fellowship and he only revealed that one word to him he said of the tree all the trees of garden you can eat but not that one not the treated of life or the tree of knowledge of good and evil right he said don't touch that right and then so they're happy they're just doing fine but brother brown said that's the thing that broke the fellowship in eden because eve failed to keep the focus of her looking on god's word and listen to the reasonings of the enemy look at the fellowship they had wonderful fellowship brother branham talks about it so wonderfully where they walk down in the cool of the day they come down for fellowship with papa god and he sat there in the evening you you've had times like that where you just fellowship with the word it's just there maybe in your car many times i've driven back and forth to work early in the morning or in the afternoon coming home but especially it seemed like in the morning i driving things would be quiet and i'd be just fellowshipping with the word of god fellowship with the word things i'd heard in church things i'd listen to on a tape and just the presence of god come down the sweetness and the calmness of that and so there's a fellowship there and they had this kind of fellowship it was so great that that shekinah glory settled down over them whatever they had in need of they could just ask and it was done they could speak and it would happen and if she just stayed right with god said so the absolute could be defined like this it's what god says does that make sense the absolute is what god says i can say it wouldn't be absolute but what god says however he says it that's why the absolute is jesus christ because he is what god says all right he is what god says he is the word that he's the logos he is what god says amen so that settles it if god said so that settles it god said so but she didn't want to do that he said see she she didn't want to do that he said she changed the focus of her glass and began to see instead of being just one way there become two ways you realize the first decision that man human beings ever made was the wrong one that's why we don't leave ourselves we get so elevated in our minds and thank god i know this i know this is right i know it but listen we don't lead ourselves it takes the holy spirit to guide you through the word that's why our absolute and forgive me for this but i believe in the inerrancy of scripture but our absolute is not just printed pages or abstinence the living revealed word christ right because it has to be revealed to you to be absolute and we'll talk about that because brother when he talks about absolute talks about an experience that mo that paul had and moses had where they met the pillar of fire and the absolute is what god says it's the word the pillar of fire the logos come and met them and then he revealed to them the word so we have to have that absolute now she saw well now maybe this man could be right maybe he is right now we know god is right but watch what she says we know god is right we do don't we but maybe he's right he said this is just more light on what god said so a person could acknowledge that god is true that god is right but not for my situation you know it's easy to to uh apply holiness to everybody else's lives isn't that right well that's the absolute man they have to do that until it comes down here and then you get in that straight you get between two opinions and that's when it always goes wrong when we don't listen to god's word he said maybe he is right we know god is right maybe he is right this is just more light on what god said he said you see there see what god says is true what god says is the absolute huh he said there is the same thing happens today he said exactly right back to the same spot see he said you see two ideas there's only one there's not no creed it's the word god's word god's purpose god's plan all other plans are not good no good i could have a plan for the church you could have a plan for your life all other plans are no good but god's plans see something has to be absolute you realize how do you know you're saved if there's no absolute if you can't ever say i know i met god and i know he revealed to me the word and i know where i belong what hour it is how would you ever have an absolute of anything how would you ever even believe for your healing if you weren't sure that god could heal now john calvin said this about christians fellowship he said among christians ought to be such a great dislike of schism that they may always avoid it so fast as lies in their power ought to prevail among them such a reverence for the ministry of the word and the sacraments that wherever they perceive these things to be there they must consider the church to exist so what he's saying is that maybe they would have a personal problem with the minister but they still must consider that a church if the word of god was preached there and they had communion together that's a very simple definition right some things are essential some things that are not but something has to be absolute there's no fellowship around a game with no rules you know i've never seen a football in a baseball game played together might be interesting you know there's also no fellowship around a game with that you don't know the rules that's why joel and i don't play rook anymore once you start applying different sets of rules it don't work right and whether that card should count or should not count matters when you're playing the game we went to joe's house and played dominoes one night and he's constantly explaining to us because we'd only played once i think before that that kind of dominoes and so he's constantly explaining the rules why would you do that why would we do that in church there's rules so there's no fellowship right and it's not we're just not made out of rules but there's got to be some boundaries there's got to be some things we say are wrong and they're just wrong in their face don't take a a rocket scientist to figure it out well but you don't know my situation but it's just wrong and god will give you mercy i believe everybody i meet i want to believe they can be saved but it doesn't change the rules of the game so you won't have a baseball football player you know they can't even agree on how many men are on the field they can't believe they can't agree on how you score a point or what to call it right but brother brown said there is an absolute in a ball game so you have to be playing the same game if you're playing a different game there's no rules there's nothing you can agree on but even within the game there's an absolute in a ball game and that's the umpire and he said right if he says it's a strike that's what it is don't care what you say so what i think when i saw it the way you saw it it's what he said it's an absolute amen if he says strike you have to agree with it you say well i don't have to agree with to start my own club go ahead you won't get them millions of dollars to play on that level you've got to agree with the empire you may not like it but it's going to be a strike why because he said it was a strike that's the way it's going to be rolled up strike what if there was no umpire he said now who would be right one said it was strike then other one said it was no strike it was the ball was he said well you'd have chaos you wouldn't know what to do there's got to be somebody somewhere he says that somebody's word is final amen hallelujah it's got to be somewhere that somebody's wearing his final man he said i feel real good right now glory hallelujah there's got to be something that's final amen he said i'm so glad of that he said oh now there's somebody who can say it's sin or it's not sin that's not me by the way all right that's not it's the word and that we have to have to have an agreement around that or we can't we won't have any fellowship he said i'm so glad of that i'm glad for an absolute no hard you no need of arguing the empire said strike that's what it is mark it up in your mind it's a strike and go on when god says anything that's the way it is no need of arguing about it that's what it is he said so that's the christian's absolute i bet do you realize what we've had in this hour you know what they've done over with sports through the advent of of the fourth dimension through television and through replay what they've done in sports is the ability to look at a play and review it and and confirm it to be correct pretty bad pretty bad you realize what's been done in this hour that god allowed a man to stand in this hour and see through that dimension and was able to verify hallelujah that's fresh church i tell you what god's so good to us look it's here it is the empire already called the balls and strikes i bet but he sent a prophet in our hour not to create a new rule book but to have the vision to see amen this is what's right amen i can rest on that i can believe for my family on that amen that's something we can fellowship around something we can rejoice around not not just the man but the fact that god sent a man to show us that the rules were correct that what god said is right amen it was an absolute in that way he saw the vision and it was right amen hallelujah someone has to say it someone has to be the one god sent and that was the man god sent amen hallelujah he said that's the absolute to the real believer that's the christian's absolute if he is a christian god said do it this way that's the way it's got to be done no argument well say it wasn't nothing about it god said so that settles it that's the absolute to the real believer it's what god says or absolute is christ because he is the word he's what god says brother brown said now you see you must get that absolute that's something that's real that identifies you with christ and his word yes the word is christ you must be sure that you can say amen to that word or your absolute is wrong you've got to you've got it built upon some creed what a secret something outside the bible right something extra biblical something that you believe about the bible that's not written in scripture he said well what about what brother branham believed brother brown believed as a word prophet you had to go back to the scripture and if you find something that you think brother branham taught that's not scriptural you need to set it aside for a while and think about that because it's got to go back to the word it's got to be scriptural we won't have the full knowledge of it until the prophet came because he said seal up these things until the time of the end right so there's some things about it particulars we didn't know but it lines up all the way through the scripture so if you come up with a doctrine based on a statement that brother branham made and said this is the truth but it don't match up to the scripture something's wrong because he could only see the replay right he was seeing the replay he was tying up the loose ends huh the play had already been made the umpire already called it and the replay come back and confirmed it amen hallelujah he showed us my vision said this is what it is amen amen now how could protestants have fellowship with catholics sin i don't mean to put down any catholics if we have any hear this today but how could protestants have fellowship with catholics when their absolute is fundamentally different because protestants claim to believe this is the word of god but when protestants do that it shows their attitude it's not really the word they're absent as their creed because their creed ties back to that mother church right now but we should be able to fellowship with anyone who makes to absolute the word and yet many protestant fundamentalist churches say this is the only thing they believe we have no fellowship with them though we would want fellowship you understand we would have no fellowship because we can fellowship around that much that this is the word but immediately fellowship starts to fall apart why because the bible says wherever the carcass is there will the eagles be gathered together the predestined ones will be gathered to the light of the hour that's not everybody not everybody's called to that there will be many there will be a number no man can number go through the tribulation period huh that's not us i don't want to go through the tribulation period but wherever the carcass is that's where the eagles will be gathered together guess where i'm at at the carcass brother called that the fresh kill of the word that's what i'm gathering around that's what we fellowship around i have nothing to preach without the message what would i have i don't have anything else i'll just go be a bab to say probably you know i have better benefits but i got better benefits in the long run but you just go it's not that you just couldn't spend your time doing something else there's not just a lot of glory in it and being a message believer but why the carcass is here wherever the carcass is that's where the eagles are gathered together amen aren't you glad there's something you can fellowship around today the eagles fellowship around the fresh kill of the word it's around something in common in matthew 16 and i'm just going to skip past that because we're out of time in matthew 16 he talked to peter and he said flesh and blood is not revealed unto you but my father which is in heaven amen what was it an absolute to peter the absolute wasn't peter himself because if it was peter himself we have nothing in common with the early church because we can't fellowship with peter in the flesh i understand we have nothing to gather around if the absolute is peter in the flesh so the absolute is not a man the absolute is christ the word amen amen but the prophet says in modern events are made clear by prophecy that said the bible is to be revealed by inspiration that's the only thing the revelation jesus told peter upon this rock this rock of revelation reveals who he is oh my if you don't have that revelation there's no starting point but see people defend it in their minds and they think well i got everything i need but if you could ever catch a revelation of who he is do you ever catch that revolution revelation would change your life why because he is the absolute to you hey man upon this rock i'll build my church not upon peter not upon himself but upon the spiritual revelation of who he was hallelujah amen ephesians 3 and 8 he says unto me whom less than the least of all saints is this grace given is that how you feel this morning that's how i feel unto me who i'm less than the least of all saints is this grace given he said that i should preach among the gentiles the unsearchable riches of christ and to make all men see what is the fellowship of the mystery the fellowship of the mystery what is the mystery he said to make all men see what is the fellowship of the mystery which from the beginning of the world has been hidden god who created all things by jesus christ listen paul could no longer have fellowship with the pharisees why because the fellowship was in christ the mystery of god revealed that's more than a sermon title that's a statement of faith christ is the mystery of god revealed and if christ is the mystery of god revealed he is the absolute of what god says right and whoever he speaks through you say could a man's word become absolute if he speaks the word of god and we have confidence that the word of god come in our day huh because god called a prophet so we can say it like that we can say the message is our absolute amen we can say that but we can also say a man is not our absolute does that make sense because the absolute is what god says it's the revealed word of the hour amen amen amen now brother brown says this bible is to be revealed by inspiration that's the only thing of revelation jesus told peter upon this rock this rock of revelation reveals who he is i already read that now let's let's go to close you see when paul got an absolute maybe we'll talk about that next week paul met christ one day he met the logos the word he met the pillar of fire you say well that was good for paul i've never met the pillar of fire have you been born again but the brandon says all christians have to meet that pillar of fire he said don't call yourself a christian unless you're willing to meet that pillar of fire you met him on the back side of the desert what is that an absolute he may not appear to you in the form of a pillar of fire he may just come in your heart and say i'm your redeemer i'm your savior he may speak to you at an altar may speak to you at your house they speak to you somewhere else he reveals himself to you and when he reveals himself to you and don't hold me i know i you say things like i've said this morning it's just the beginning you're gonna have to listen for a few more services to really go know where i'm going but see if we don't realize if we don't have that that experience we got nowhere to go we got nothing to fellowship around and so people grow up in the message feeling empty and they grow up and they end up leaving the church or maybe even turning down the message altogether so the message was the worst thing that ever happened to me because they are of all men most miserable because they were in the message but the message wasn't in them and they never met an absolute so there was never a something that grabbed hold of them but you've met an absolute right and if you've met that it changed your fellowship you find yourself in church your back hurts hopefully hopefully some of you heard a little less with the new chair some of you may hurt more i don't know it's hard to find something that fits everybody but you know you sit there and you wonder what am i doing here i'm in the house of god last week we had a long service and now i've gone over my time today but look i have something i'm here for i have fellowship with brother joe i have fellowship with all of you brothers and sisters why because there's an absolute i called you by your right name today twice we have an absolute the absolute isn't me remembering your name absolutely doesn't mean being a good preacher the absolute is christ we met the absolute hallelujah and he is the word he is what god said now we can have true fellowship communion with one another there was a musicians go ahead and come there was a meeting of the american psychological association where a psychologist at union college and a graduate student at columbia university got together and presented some findings on how members of the various sections of 11 major orchestras perceived one another and they said this they said the percussionist or insensitive unintelligent and hard of hearing there you go brother stewart it says yet fun-loving you know how we we typecast drummers right drummers mostly look alike and i'm not just talking about brother stewart or messy jumpers but if you've seen drummers that play professionally they're all kind of wild there's certain it takes a certain kind of vibe to play the drums right i played guitar but not well because it just takes a certain kind of you know personality or at least people see them that way the orchestra members describe the bat the brass players as loud and that's probably the first thing that come to your mind too and you thought of trumpets or music in general maybe especially if you don't like music and some people don't or don't like loud music they said the the brass players are loud so they had nothing in common there right nothing in common now musicians up here the piano know we're gonna have a few things in common but not the same things as the percussionists have in common the the base of the drum can get going together pretty good but if they run off and leave the piano you got a problem huh i'm making a point here not preaching about music hang with me the woodwind players were held in the highest esteem you know their instruments are hard to play so everybody thought well they they must be really smart everybody thought they were quiet meticulous but a bit egotistical this is how everybody perceived each other how do they play together how is there ever even enough agreement to come together and play a piece of music well the answer is simple they subordinate their feelings their biases to the leadership of the conductor you ever thought that must be a thankless job but he's the most important man up there without a good conductor you can't have a symphony even though they're all playing from the same sheet music we've got this the written word of god we've got the message of the hour that's the sheet music we've got it we've got the umpire's call we got the replay but there has to be agreement with the leadership of the conductor or we're never going to have any fellowship there's got to be something that comes down among us and settles in a reality of an experience that we've had i have fellowship with god so i have fellowship with you i love god so i love you i can't say i hate you because and say i love god i love god and i love you i get along with you because the conductor is standing there i'm not the conductor brother david or one of these brothers in this thing and they're not the conductor he's the conductor would you bow your heads with me the basic beginnings of the christian life is to subordinate your thoughts your feelings to surrender what you think to the leadership of the conductor god has a symphony brother branham explained that to us how that he was the symphony was played out and they watched the music and the music has ups to it and lows to it it has different parts plays quietly for a while and plays loudly for a while revival and a cycle of revival and death but they're still all in the music there's got to be a conductor standing there in your life or it'll never do any good there's got to be a conductor every one of us has to have a conductor in our lives every one of us has to be subordinate to that paul says i keep under my body and bring it under subjection because i want to be subordinate to the conductor in the way i preach and the way i conduct myself in the ministry and the way that the way that you sit and listen to the word everything about us what we do what we believe lord i may not be able to do just exactly like someone else would do i mean i have the gift someone else does but let me sit here if i'm going to play hard if i'm going to be here in my life in this body let me follow the leadership of the conductor you must have the holy ghost in your life brother writer makes some strong statements about that where he says no matter if they believe something different he said but they god gave them the holy ghost and he gave me the holy ghost that's even hard for me to understand but if god gives you the holy ghost and he'll lead you to the truth he will he has to so thank god for that experience that you have and if you've not subordinated your thoughts and your actions and all those things to it would you do that today that's all it is it's simplicity in the gospel surrender yourself to that you don't go to an altar to get something you go to get rid of some things you go to get rid of pride and selfishness and things like that god help us it's hard i know it's hard you've been hurt before i've been hurt before and that hurt as we said builds a complex until you you can't you just can't subordinate that and it's hard for you to sit and fellowship with believers because that hurt is in your way but you've got to let go of that enough to have fellowship with god when you have fellowship with god you have fellowship with the brothers and sisters it's just natural it's just what you do heavenly father we love you today and we thank you for this group of people that have gathered together thank you for those that are watching today on the stream i know i've talked about a lot of these things before but lord i just want to bring it home to us it wouldn't matter what i would say or what someone else would say but what did the words say what did the umpire say and what was revealed to us in this hour what what did the vision say about who you were what did the prophets say what what message are we under we're sitting around the revealed word of the hour surely we can have fellowship instead of fighting with one another like shackles or hyenas or lions or may we gather around the word like eagles that's enough for everybody lord may we just feed on that word until one day we gain strength lord we fly away i pray you'd grant it lord god oh how we want to fly away we're so thankful i'm so thankful for the spirit that we've felt today for the presence of god here in the church may that never leave us oh god may we never get so caught up in our preconceived notions and ideas that we have to disfellowship one with one another over an opinion god may we stay right with the word lord if someone else leaves it to be a little different or has it believes it's a seed let them spit it out we don't throw away the pie lord we believe you're our redeemer we believe you're our god we thank you for being who you are i pray you'd walk with us through life lord once again i pray if there's anyone lord that needs healing today i pray that you would heal them completely where they're at right now i believe lord that the power the power of the word and your presence here with us lord any any disease any sickness lord can be made well i was watching those who were sick today and in need lord i pray you'd bless them thank you for each one in jesus name amen thank you lord let's stand together could we just worship him a moment i believe his presence is here today just worship him a moment he's our absolute ease he's christ in our life
