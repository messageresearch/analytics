[2:14] young men that are carrying this message
[2:17] amen carrying that banner
[2:19] let's look here in genesis 13 and the
[2:22] 10th
[2:23] verse and lot lifted up his eyes and
[2:26] beheld all the plains of jordan
[2:28] that it was well watered everywhere
[2:31] before the lord destroyed sodom and
[2:33] gomorrah
[2:34] even as the garden of the lord like the
[2:36] land of egypt as thou comest unto zore
[2:41] then lot chose him out of the plain of
[2:43] jordan and lot journeyed east and they
[2:46] separated themselves the one from the
[2:48] other
[2:49] and abram dwelled in the land of canaan
[2:52] and lot dwelled in the cities of the
[2:54] plain
[2:55] and pitched his tent towards sodom
[2:58] but the men of sodom were wicked
[3:00] sinners before the lord exceedingly
[3:03] and the lord said unto abram after that
[3:06] lot was separated from him lift up now
[3:09] thine eyes
[3:10] and look from the place where thou art
[3:12] northward and southward and eastward and
[3:14] westward
[3:15] for all the land which thou seest to
[3:18] thee
[3:19] will i give it
[3:21] and to thy seed
[3:23] forever
[3:24] i'd also like to look here in the book
[3:26] of revelations
[3:28] the 20th chapter
[3:30] and
[3:31] we'll start at the first verse
[3:34] amen
[3:36] praise the lord
[3:38] are you glad you're a christian
[3:40] amen
[3:42] i tell you what that message last night
[3:44] was wonderful
[3:46] amen
[3:48] now
[3:49] uh revelations 20 and 1 and i saw
[3:53] an angel come down from heaven having
[3:55] the key of the bottomless pit
[3:58] and the great chain was in his hand
[4:01] and he
[4:02] laid hold on the dragon
[4:05] that old serpent which is the devil
[4:08] and bound him a thousand years and cast
[4:10] him into the bottomless pit
[4:12] and shut him up
[4:14] and that he uh should deceive the
[4:17] nations no more until the thousand years
[4:20] should be filled and after that he must
[4:23] be loosed for a season let's go to the
[4:25] lord in prayer
[4:26] father we just want to thank you tonight
[4:28] for your love and
[4:30] and we're asking lord that your holy
[4:32] spirit
[4:33] would just come in a real special way
[4:36] and
[4:37] and that you would minister your word we
[4:39] have felt your presence we've loved the
[4:41] songs
[4:42] we there's something about a meeting
[4:44] like this lord where we can all get
[4:46] together it's a it's such a great
[4:48] encouragement to the local church and
[4:51] and lord it's an encouragement father
[4:53] for
[4:54] those of us who are visiting lord
[4:57] but lord the most important thing is for
[4:59] you to come
[5:01] and i'm asking lord that you would
[5:02] minister to us and that you would speak
[5:05] lord that you would meet every need that
[5:08] is present
[5:09] in the name of the lord jesus christ
[5:12] can the church say amen
[5:14] and amen god bless you you may be seated
[5:18] amen i
[5:20] want to speak here tonight on she
[5:22] possesses all things
[5:25] and um
[5:27] amen uh i'm i'm
[5:29] not a deep speaker by any means those
[5:32] have hurt me you know that
[5:34] but my heart is to help god's people
[5:38] and i and as i was in prayer i i have
[5:42] um
[5:44] wanted to
[5:45] to be uh you know be a blessing but not
[5:48] just preach any sermon we got a lot of
[5:50] sermons that any of us can preach but we
[5:51] want god to be a part of it
[5:54] and and this this message is
[5:57] this thoughts have been coming to my
[5:59] mind
[6:00] she possesses
[6:02] all things
[6:04] i i think about keys as
[6:07] amen uh these there are many keys to
[6:10] many doors there's
[6:11] uh there are the keys to homes there you
[6:15] got their key to your interior doors
[6:17] exterior doors you've got keys to your
[6:20] car doors you've got keys to for the car
[6:23] ignition you've got keys for the office
[6:25] you just you got all kinds of keys
[6:28] and uh these days keys are sophisticated
[6:30] you've got amen uh not the old skeleton
[6:33] keys that your great grandma had but
[6:35] you've got you you've got uh key fobs
[6:38] that you can carry in your pocket and
[6:40] any man get up close to the car and just
[6:43] push a button and it'll open up for you
[6:45] and you can push a button in your car
[6:47] and amen and and and it opens it it
[6:50] starts for you and you you can just
[6:52] leave the device there in your in in
[6:54] your car or in your purse and and uh
[6:57] you know it's an incredible thing you
[7:00] think of keys there's also the security
[7:02] passes that are that are very common and
[7:04] popular today they hey man you can swipe
[7:07] a swipe a card over a locking device
[7:10] and and uh uh it'll open your motel room
[7:14] it'll allow you in your office it'll
[7:16] it'll allow you to amen even even
[7:19] transfer money from your your bank
[7:21] account amen and uh uh to to the gas
[7:25] station without even having to go inside
[7:28] i mean amen but there is it's a key
[7:30] there's a special key that only you can
[7:32] use
[7:33] uh uh to to get into those funds can you
[7:37] say man
[7:38] amen these days they've got the yeah you
[7:40] know they've got the numeric codes where
[7:42] you can amen uh you can put them on your
[7:44] computers and it locks others out of
[7:46] your personal information
[7:48] and uh amen the only person with the
[7:50] passcode is uh is to a man uh uh is the
[7:55] only one that can get inside there can
[7:57] you say amen
[7:59] amen but the common denominator between
[8:02] amen
[8:03] with the key
[8:05] is the owner
[8:07] amen and the one that has been given the
[8:10] permission to use that key
[8:13] now you can have a key but if you don't
[8:16] know i hey man my my boys uh joshua man
[8:19] he used to carry a big old thing of keys
[8:21] around amen and a big old wad of keys
[8:24] that you know you'd ask him well where
[8:26] do these keys uh go to he didn't have
[8:28] the slightest idea but he was feeling
[8:29] pretty important amen he had a kid he
[8:32] also when he was younger he had a he had
[8:34] a wallet plumb full of cards
[8:37] he man i mean i you know i'd pull my
[8:39] wallet out and i'd have a few carts and
[8:41] he'd pull his wallet out and his i mean
[8:42] his was packed with cards now it didn't
[8:45] go anywhere amen he didn't know what he
[8:48] was using those things for
[8:51] but he had so it's not just having a key
[8:56] it's not just having amen a card or a
[9:00] passcode but you've got to be a part of
[9:03] the owner
[9:05] what can you say man amen the owner of
[9:08] the house he's the one that possesses
[9:11] the keys to it the owner to the car is
[9:14] the one who has the key to the car amen
[9:18] so that security code is not just for
[9:22] anybody it is for the one amen that has
[9:26] been authorized to use it
[9:30] well praise the lord amen now i'm the
[9:33] owner of my house and amen and i i've

[10:11] not talking about somebody amen that
[10:14] that that has heard of somebody who
[10:16] knows somebody who knows somebody who
[10:18] has a key i'm talking about somebody who
[10:22] possesses the king

[13:48] possess all things you can have tongues
[13:50] of men and angels and not possess all
[13:54] things
[13:55] amen but i want to tell you tonight
[13:57] eternal life
[13:59] is the possessor of all things
[14:04] abraham was authorized to possess
[14:07] a man by the one who had called by the
[14:10] one who owned by the one who had created
[14:13] all things
[14:14] he told abraham i want you to rise and i
[14:17] want you to possess i want you to look
[14:19] to the east i want you to look to the
[14:22] west i want you to look northward i want
[14:25] you to look southward
[14:27] and everything that you see
[14:30] i'm giving it to you you can rise and
[14:34] possess it for the promise is unto you
[14:38] and to your children are you hearing me
[14:42] amen you see lot didn't have that key of
[14:44] divine revelation lord didn't have that
[14:47] little special something there but you
[14:50] see god gave the key to abraham he was
[14:54] the possessor
[15:01] lot wasn't given that key of revelation
[15:04] and and so he he didn't understand it
[15:07] and when it came down to the trials and
[15:09] everything all going crazy for him he he
[15:11] went down into into sodom and gomorrah
[15:14] amen he wasn't privy to
[15:16] all of the things that abraham knew are
[15:18] you hearing me abraham didn't get upset

[15:22] about it abraham knew that he possessed
[15:26] even a lot down there

[15:32] now brother branham says abraham
[15:35] was heir to all
[15:37] by the promise
[15:39] so he could lay claim to everything that
[15:41] was in the land
[15:43] and the land itself
[15:45] abraham was given the promise
[15:47] now we understand that abraham was the
[15:49] poorest man in all the country because
[15:51] he lived out in the desert and lived in
[15:53] peace with god
[15:55] lot rich and lived in the city
[15:58] become the governor of the city and he
[16:00] said in the gate he was a judge he
[16:02] judged the city and all the riches and
[16:04] things and but abraham was in the desert
[16:06] perhaps the poorest man in the land yet
[16:08] he had a claim to possess all of it amen
[16:12] i like that well can you say man
[16:14] amen he says old tonight you may not be
[16:17] rich with the world's goods but we
[16:19] possess all things

[16:26] and possesses all things i like that the
[16:29] old song we used to sing years ago my
[16:32] father is rich with houses and land he
[16:35] holds the world of the wealth of the
[16:37] world in his hand rubies and diamonds
[16:40] and silver and gold his coffers are full
[16:43] his riches untowed and we are the
[16:46] possessor of it

[44:05] those
[44:05] [Music]
[44:07] those complexes that make you think that
[44:09] no one loves you the complexes make you
[44:11] think everyone's against you the
[44:12] complexes that make you think that
[44:14] you'll never be in the pride the
[44:16] complexes that makes you think amen that
[44:18] you're not worthy amen and you're
[44:20] discouraged why don't you hear that
[44:22] shout tonight that says i am alive i was
[44:28] dead i went to hell and i took the key
[44:33] [Applause]
[44:33] [Music]
[44:43] it doesn't matter what the pomegranate
[44:45] the cankerworm the caterpillar the
[44:47] locust it doesn't matter what any of
[44:49] them has done
[44:51] it might look bad it might have looked
[44:52] rough
[44:54] but i still possess the key
[44:57] and in this last day i've come
[44:59] to give you that revelation
[45:01] well come on church
[45:03] hallelujah amen brother bradham says i'm
[45:05] told the aviators
[45:08] who fly amen these here real fast jet
[45:10] planes he says they say that plane
[45:12] getting up to a certain speed it
[45:14] vibrates and it shakes and it seems like
[45:16] the boats is going to fly out of it and
[45:18] the wings are going to come off until
[45:20] they pass that sound barrier but once
[45:23] they pass that sound barrier
[45:25] they say the plane just sells out just
[45:28] in ease when it passes the sound barrier
[45:31] that's the obstacle that's in the way of
[45:34] the plane and when it passes its own
[45:37] sound
[45:38] somebody say when it passes its own
[45:41] sound
[45:42] amen you've got to pass your own sound
[45:47] you've got to pass your own complex
[45:50] you've got a cam aiming past your own
[45:53] even filters that you've got that is
[45:56] keeping the word of god from being real
[45:58] in you i said you've got to pass your
[46:02] own sound but when you pass your own
[46:06] sound
[46:07] amen then it runs at ease he says if the
[46:10] church of this day could ever pray till
[46:13] they pass the sin barrier the unbelief
[46:17] barrier then they could shout the
[46:19] victory of a living god
[46:22] when they once passed that barrier by
[46:25] looking to the unseen and letting the
[46:28] world vibrate and do what it wants to
[46:31] but there is a living god
[46:39] he says when we lose our
[46:40] unbelief in him
[46:43] and past that place that the world is
[46:44] saying the days of miracles has passed
[46:47] makes you shake for there's no such
[46:49] thing as the baptism of the holy ghost
[46:50] it makes you wonder
[46:52] if you just just look on at the unseen
[46:55] to the god who promised it for the
[46:57] promises unto you and your children to
[46:59] them that are as far off even as many as
[47:01] the lord our god shall call if you'll
[47:03] look to the blessed word that says jesus
[47:05] christ is the same yesterday today and
[47:07] forever and turn your heads back and
[47:10] press on until you pass the vibration
[47:14] past the unbelief barrier or that the
[47:16] sin barrier all the barriers that seem
[47:19] to hinder you then you can fly free
[47:22] in the faith of god

[59:22] you possess

[59:31] position

[59:52] god you always were a son of god the
[59:56] blood of jesus christ has simply brought
[59:59] you back to where adam and eve failed
[1:00:04] [Applause]
[1:00:06] hallelujah
[1:00:08] it's the exact key that jesus used on
[1:00:10] the devil
[1:00:11] when in defeating the mountain
[1:00:14] jesus knew who he was
[1:00:16] and when the devil was trying to come up
[1:00:18] and tell me he came right back with the
[1:00:19] word he stood toe to toe
[1:00:21] and he defeated him
[1:00:23] he didn't use any of his supernatural
[1:00:25] powers
[1:00:27] he simply took the revelation of who he
[1:00:30] was
[1:00:31] and quoted scripture all right
[1:00:34] brother says he'd done that amen he done
[1:00:38] that so that the weakest of christians

[1:01:14] possess the key
[1:01:16] of revelation come on preach
[1:01:20] there is nothing amen can stand before

[1:01:28] hallelujah
[1:01:30] he's the roots
[1:01:33] he's the vine
[1:01:34] or we're simply the branch
[1:01:39] the bride is not given anything
[1:01:41] different than jesus
[1:01:44] the bride has the original life
[1:01:48] the original science

[1:01:56] [Music]
[1:02:04] message

[1:02:35] belong to a message to the message

[1:02:41] you can belong
[1:02:44] to this filter and that filter on this
[1:02:46] case
[1:02:55] and if you do it the way god said it
[1:02:57] through the prophet
[1:02:58] i i i'm one of those guys that like
[1:03:00] saying it like he sings it say it like
[1:03:02] he says
[1:03:03] believe it like he believes
[1:03:06] i'm just not one of those guys that
[1:03:08] think that i'm just a little more
[1:03:10] divinely revelation
[1:03:13] i think god sent a prophet
[1:03:17] and if i want in that message to work i
[1:03:20] better do it and say it like he'd done
[1:03:24] it
[1:03:28] well praise the lord amen don't you
[1:03:30] believe that
[1:03:34] yeah
[1:03:35] yes sir then you'll see the supernatural
[1:03:39] brother branham says he will be as
[1:03:41] definitely floored today yes sir as when
[1:03:44] jesus withstood his every
[1:03:47] effort to gain power over him in the
[1:03:49] best way thank you
[1:03:51] yes satan hates revelation
[1:03:57] [Applause]
[1:04:07] but we will prevail over him
[1:04:12] i'm not under the antichrist spirit i'm
[1:04:15] not under that amen that dead lukewarm
[1:04:18] cold
[1:04:19] amen twice plucked up religion that i
[1:04:22] came out of amen satan hates me because
[1:04:26] i know who i am there is a fire pudding
[1:04:30] in my heart i've got something anchored
[1:04:32] down needs safety
[1:04:35] the blood when he sees her
[1:04:41] [Music]
[1:04:48] you're proud of me
[1:04:50] i found out how to use a timer i have
[1:04:52] not been over
[1:05:00] now
[1:05:01] revelations 3 and 7
[1:05:04] and to the angel of the church in
[1:05:06] philadelphia these things saith he that
[1:05:08] is holy he that is true
[1:05:10] he that hath the key of david
[1:05:13] he that openeth it
[1:05:17] and no man shouted
[1:05:19] and shudder and no man
[1:05:28] can you see how important it is today
[1:05:30] what you say when you're preaching what
[1:05:32] jesus when he was trying to show the
[1:05:33] last days
[1:05:35] he was showing the key to watch this he
[1:05:36] showed it so emphatically now watch what
[1:05:38] brother branham says he says oh how
[1:05:40] beautiful are those words how majestic
[1:05:43] is even the sound of them how thrilling
[1:05:45] to think that all those attributes
[1:05:48] can be applied to one person
[1:05:51] who would dare to say such things about
[1:05:54] himself but the lord jesus christ the
[1:05:56] lord of glory
[1:05:57] i believe the key to interpreting
[1:06:00] exactly to what uh what each of these
[1:06:03] wonderfully descriptive phrases means is
[1:06:05] found in in uh in verse nine that he
[1:06:07] goes on now and he begins to and then he
[1:06:09] then he goes to another scripture here
[1:06:11] in isaiah 22 and 22 and he says and the
[1:06:15] key of the house of david
[1:06:21] [Music]
[1:06:28] now why is that key now i got my key
[1:06:33] did you need that key was that key
[1:06:34] important
[1:06:37] oh there it is
[1:06:39] i've got it
[1:06:42] man it ain't a ford key sorry
[1:06:51] so
[1:06:53] now i keep the key in my pocket
[1:06:57] some of you ladies keep your key
[1:06:59] in your purse
[1:07:02] but jesus
[1:07:04] has his key
[1:07:12] on
[1:07:23] now
[1:07:25] why is this
[1:07:26] key on the show the one who pulled the
[1:07:28] seals back and showed it to the seventh
[1:07:30] age message
[1:07:32] all right
[1:07:33] and the seventh age messenger is sitting
[1:07:35] there he's going to tell us right
[1:07:37] there's something special yes sir all
[1:07:39] right come on about
[1:07:43] he says the spirit uses his old
[1:07:45] testament reference concerning the lord
[1:07:46] jesus christ and somebody say and
[1:07:50] his ministry in the church
[1:07:54] all right what the key of david
[1:07:56] signified at that time is merely shadow
[1:07:59] which is now fulfilled in jesus standing
[1:08:03] in the midst of the lampstand
[1:08:07] it has to do with our lord after his
[1:08:09] resurrection
[1:08:10] and not his earthly government
[1:08:13] but what does this key signify
[1:08:17] he says the answer lies in the position
[1:08:20] of the king
[1:08:22] it is not in the hand it is not worn
[1:08:24] around his neck all right it is not
[1:08:27] placed in the hands of other men or the
[1:08:29] verse would be saying he alone has the
[1:08:30] key has the use of that key for his
[1:08:33] phone opens and shuts and no man has the
[1:08:34] right to jesus yes sir but where is the
[1:08:36] key it is on his shoulder what what does
[1:08:39] shoulder have to do with it yeah he says
[1:08:42] reader uh isaiah 9 and 6
[1:08:45] and the government shall be upon his
[1:08:48] show oh yeah what does this mean
[1:08:51] the answer is this
[1:08:53] yeah i would love to be preaching on
[1:08:54] this but i took too much time before so
[1:08:56] i'm just reading this all right
[1:08:59] he says the answer is the phrase the
[1:09:01] government upon his shoulder comes from
[1:09:03] the wedding ceremony of the east
[1:09:06] when the bride has been committed to the
[1:09:09] groom right come on she takes off her
[1:09:12] veil amen and places it over the blue
[1:09:15] shoulder
[1:09:17] signifying that not only is he she under
[1:09:20] his dominion
[1:09:22] that she has transferred her rights to
[1:09:24] him
[1:09:25] that he is the head
[1:09:27] but also that he bears the
[1:09:29] responsibility and the care and that he
[1:09:33] and he alone no one else no other man no
[1:09:37] other power has any right and
[1:09:39] responsibility
[1:09:41] and that beloved
[1:09:43] is the key of david
[1:09:45] god being sovereign he for knew my
[1:09:48] divine decree exactly who would be in
[1:09:50] his bride he chose her she did not
[1:09:53] choose him he called her she did not
[1:09:55] come on her own he died for her he
[1:09:58] washed her in his own blood he paid the
[1:10:00] price for her she belongs to him and to
[1:10:03] him alone and she is wholly committed to
[1:10:06] him and he accepts the obligation
[1:10:09] he is her hand for christ as the head of
[1:10:12] the church as abraham called abraham
[1:10:15] sarah called abraham lord even so the
[1:10:18] pride is happy that he is her amen
[1:10:23] he speaks and she obeys
