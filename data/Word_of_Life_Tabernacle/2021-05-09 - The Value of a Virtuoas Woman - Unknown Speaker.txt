thank you for that lord jesus i pray that you would just take me out of the way in this service lord if there's any any way that anything that you want to do i pray that you would be free to do it today speak to us directly from your word lord as lord so many are out today and with different things but some visitors here today we thank you for them and i pray god you would bless them each one of us is here for a reason there's something you want us to hear and so i pray we'd have ears that would be open lord to hear your word we pray pray that you'd grant it come lord and anoint your servant move through your word lord and through your spirit we pray in jesus name amen amen god bless you turn with me if you would to matthew 13. matthew chapter 13 and verse 45. good to have each one of you in the house of the lord so many of our families have been struggling lately with colds and different things allergies and some are out today traveling visiting with family members and i want to wish you a happy mother's day today and if you're here to honor your mother god bless you for doing that and i believe that god will honor you for that that's the first commandment with promise is to honor your mother and your father and he said if you do that you'll live long on the earth so we thank god for that promise today good to be a christian today matthew chapter 13 and verses 45 and 46 he says again the kingdom of heaven is likened to a merchant man seeking goodly pearls who when he had found one pearl of great price went and sold all that he had and bought it and pray the lord without his blessing to the reading of the word you may be seated i want to speak to you this morning on the value of a virtuous woman there was a man by the name of g campbell morgan was a great preacher in the last century and he had four sons who were all preachers and someone came into a place where all the family was there and they asked one of his sons his name was howard they asked howard this question said howard who is the greatest preacher in your family of course he would thought he would say his dad or perhaps himself or one of his brothers and howard looked at his father for a moment and then he looked across at the at the man and he said my mother out of all them preachers he said my mother is the greatest preacher in the family of course she didn't preach behind a pulpit but brother branham would tell us this way he said i think there's five gospels matthew mark luke john and mother because he said mother gets them when they're young before they're old enough to read matthew mark luke and john they hear from mother a mother can teach a child before they're old enough to even read the word and and learn from the bible and so it's important what a mother teaches the book of proverbs says it this way proverbs 31 and 1 the words of king lemuel the prophecy that his mother taught him so his mother taught him a prophecy brother branham tells us that every mother is a preacher and god gives her a little congregation at home to preach to and and so that's a great responsibility isn't it to be able to do that and and today i think i was talking with my mother this morning and i think that mothers care for their children today they really do they they take care of them and i see mothers that they wouldn't let anything happen to their little babies and that's a mother that's a good thing but there's got to be something even beyond that as a christian mother it's beyond even caring for their natural welfare but it's teaching that child from the time they're even born to be able to to believe the gospel to to believe in christ to love god with all their heart to go to church when the doors are open things that that are taught by mother's example in a mother's life and a mother's words from the time that they're born from the time they're very little and you don't understand and i see most many of our mothers aren't here this morning because for different reasons but i see sometimes they struggle with their little babies in church and and that's difficult to do it's hard to to keep up and and i know jason and emily can can uh identify with this today but it's hard to keep up with your little one in church and i watch them and sometimes they don't get anything i don't think my wife got anything out of church for a couple years and and and that's difficult but the fact that you go you bring them you you you pay attention to the word of god is teaching that baby even as a baby is teaching on a prophecy it's teaching them how what a mother what kind of prophecy did can this king's mother teach him it taught him about what a woman was about what a real mother was about what a real woman of god would be and that's the prophecy that you're teaching your children today that a real mom will take her children to church and and love them with all of her heart and give them that that solid foundation that no matter what happens in their life from there on they can always go back to that and there's a promise in the word that says train up a child in a way that they should go and when they're old they won't depart from it they may bend back and forth now but if you train them up according to their bit according to the way they should go when they're old they will they will come back they've got something to come back to because they were trained right so that's it's a great responsibility a solemn obligation that a mother has to teach your children and i think we could take that in a spiritual way as i'm just talking to you from my heart this morning but in a spiritual way a church has a great obligation to their newborn babies in christ to the young people to the to the children to the people who would be coming to the church we have an obligation to train them up right and to teach them the things and sometimes you may get bored and think well that's simple that's something i already knew but not everybody does because they've got to learn their abcs before they can learn the algebra right so we have an obligation to the first person that if you're in a message home the first person to present the message to the baby is the mother and she may not do that by saying this is what we believe in this but she does that by the way she lives right she doesn't do certain things and go certain places and act certain ways she's a she's a believer and the child knows that and it knows what a a believer is what a believing woman ought to be and it's important and so in proverbs 31 it goes on in verse 10 to say who can find a virtuous woman for her price is far above rubies and that word i just kind of want to break this down for a moment because it's important i just want us to ponder it to dwell on it you know sometimes great things can happen in your life your life can be changed just because you spent a few minutes pondering and looking at the word of god and just looking at it soberly and thinking because there's power in this word and but and the bible teaches us who can find a virtuous woman in other words she's rare she's scarce who can find a virtuous woman or price is far above rubies that virtue is strength or power it's not virtue as we would think of being a moral person though it would be that because the person has to have strength to stand for morality in the day that we live in but a virtuous woman is not just a woman who does everything right but it's that word is actually strength or power it literally means efficiency might wealth or an army you ever think about a mother as a whole army and and that that would be i saw something this morning i think my mother shared that there was a whole bunch of different jobs that a mother did so we got somebody to replace you and there's about 12 people out there and so that's a virtuous woman it's the idea of strength like when jesus was touched by the woman with the blood issue and he said virtue has gone from me it's that idea of virtue it's strength it's gone from who can find this kind of a woman a strong woman it's the idea of worth or excellence who can find that kind of a woman because her price that price is value her value is far above rubies and that that word rubies is actually a round gemstone and so it's probably a pearl a pearl and we know that the pearl is rare and jesus uses that in the parable he says if that merchant could find a pearl of great price he would sell all that he had to go get that pearl because it's so rare and a virtuous woman this kind of a woman that proverbs 31 talks about is a rare thing in the day and age that we live in and so i take my hat off to you today if i had one on or i i'll salute you today as as mothers that are here that are watching this morning because you are doing something that is it's hard to find and it's valuable because of its number one because of its scarcity it's difficult to find a virtuous woman he says who can find a virtuous woman her values more than pearls and pearls are interesting because they're extremely unique and they're the only gemstone that's found in a living creature they come from a clam or a mollusk they're found within that living creature deep in the ocean and unlike diamonds or rubies or emeralds pearls require no cutting you don't have to polish them but when they when you find them that's the form that they're worn it in in jewelry that's the form that they're worth something in it's the form that you find them in they naturally form just in a certain way to be a a perfect color and just and they're all different but they're so very rare that only one in several million shellfish yield a pearl one in several million and so the the writer is saying who can find that kind of a a rarity who can find it i believe that i found one and i had one for a mother and i i trust that you did as well but it's not common who can find it and so you know but there's a different kind of pearl that you've probably seen maybe you have some at the house you may have some real pearls at the house i don't know but there's what they call a cultured pearl and a cultured pearl is very beautiful in fact more beautiful than a natural pearl and you can't tell from the outside whether it's a cultured pearl or a natural pearl and what they do is if you to know that you have a a natural pearl they have to give you an x-ray certificate that they've actually x-rayed the stone to find out what's on the inside of it because you can only tell the difference in a natural pearl in a cultured pearl based on what's on the inside oh i think christians are like that too i think a christian mother is like that too you can only really tell the difference based on what's on the inside what's on the heart and many times the outside may not be so look so beautiful because the the cultured pearl the one that they grew in a farm in fresh water those kind of pearls are much more beautiful but worth much less money there are much less value why because they're not rare you can grow they can grow them in a couple years where a natural pearl takes a lifetime to grow and so it's it's of great price it's hard to find one in a million and so it's more beautiful a cultured pearl is more beautiful but less character first peter three and three speaks of a woman a godly christian woman who said who's adorning let it not be that outward adorning of plating the hair and that would be back then they would they would braid it and then they'd put all kinds of stuff in it and of wearing of gold or putting on of apparel he said don't let it be that but let it be the hidden man of the heart the hidden man of the heart that's you when you use the x-ray machine you can see there's something beautiful on the inside that was formed over a lifetime let it be the hidden man of the heart and that which is not corruptable even the ornament amen of a meek and a quiet spirit not something created by max factor or whoever the the person might be today that makes the makeup and the jewelry not something created by that but something beautiful on the inside people make and i see this even as message young people make such mistakes when it comes to choosing someone for a wife or a husband i see this in girls too especially with guys they'll look for some guy that's tall dark and handsome and don't realize that the guy that they've overlooked the whole time might be the one that could really help them in their life and they're not really looking for character but they're looking for something that looks good on facebook but on the inside is what matters when the kids are sick and and and nothing's going right and he lost his job and she she doesn't have anything hardly to wear and and everything's going wrong that's the moments when it shows what's on the inside when you're mad at one another and you can't you you just just can't hardly stand to be around one another and my mom excuse me for using this but she was we were talking this morning and and i'm thankful for the opportunity that i've had and she's drove these miles to come to church and be with us and and i get to talk to her because we ministry kept us apart for a long time because just in a different place but thankful to have my mom but she was talking this morning how that my dad had told her before he died he said no matter how mad you were at me you always fixed my breakfast well that something to that effect that that meant something you know that's what matters it's a character there's something there that means something beyond what we can what we can put on on the outside a character and that's what we should look for in a husband or a wife or whatever the case might be but it's a pearl and it's in the sight of god of great value pearls are formed when an irritant which is usually a grain of sand or some kind of food gets deep enough inside the shell of a mollusk that it can't get it out it's it's like paul's thorn in the flesh he said i prayed and god said my strength my grace is sufficient for thee an irritant on the inside that gets inside and it just can't eradicate it and it causes the shell to produce a substance called naker which coats the irritant and it keeps coating it year after year after year to protect the the shell or the mollusk it coats the irritant with the shiny substance that's found in the interior of the shell and eventually that becomes a pearl but it takes years now i found it interesting in revelation 21 21 that the 12 gates of new jerusalem are 12 pearls and i don't know if you've ever realized this but they weren't made up of lots of pearls right and these are big gates right great big gates in the wall of the new jerusalem and they're not made up of any pearls every several gate was one pearl now think with me for a moment what kind of irritant would it take to make a pearl big enough to make a gate out of think about that for a moment see we don't always realize what god's doing in our life what kind of irritant would it take well go back and look at those each one of these gates was named after one of the 12 patriarchs one on each gate and if you went back and look and we won't go to all of them to save time but we'll just go to one you find joseph joseph was a man who'd done nothing wrong but he was persecuted and the bible says in psalms 105 17 he sent a man before them even joseph who was sold for a servant whose feet they hurt with fetters he was laid in iron until the time that his word came the word of the lord tried him now think about this for a moment what could make his life like a pearl that would be large enough to make up a gate of the of that city what kind of irritant would it take it actually took the word of god see many times and i hope i'm not getting too far off the path here but many times it's the it's the word that you believe that is the irritant in your life hang with me for a moment he said i would never call the word an irritated but think about it many times that's what tries you from the time you're a young person growing up and you don't dress like everybody else you don't look like everybody else you don't live like everybody else you don't talk like everybody else and it becomes a trial at times in your life the word and and many times there's promises that you believe in see somebody don't believe in healing they don't have to worry about being healed they're not worried about whether god heals them or not because they don't believe in healing right if they would get healed they'd chalk it up to something else right but but a person who believes in healing believes it's for them and so you believe in healing i believe in healing and so healing is for me but yet many times healing is delayed and so the word itself tries us as we believe it because it doesn't happen right when we think it should happen and it doesn't happen when everybody else thinks it should happen but we know it's coming we know that it's there's something down the road that we can look to that that word is is something that's coming but yet we we just don't we we can't grab ahold of it right now and yet we say it's true and and you're you're sick in your body but you say i'm healed and you make mistakes but you say i'm saved but what is it there's a time that your word comes the promise is always being an irritant to israel to the nation of israel the promise was always inherited because you know to them it was like hey we're god's chosen people but i wish he would get to work because over the thousands of years through their own fault and through different things that would happen through our fault because god blinded them for our sakes that through thousands of years though they were god's elect they suffered more than any other group of people ever suffered but let me tell you what they also survived and it ought to be a testimony to us today that if you are the elect of god not only will you suffer but you will survive the suffering is not going to destroy you it's not going to take you down it's not going to eliminate you it's not going to take you out of out of god's gene pool so to speak and make you not a believer but the suffering just produces that life that that pearl that god wants in your life until the time that his word came the word of the lord tried him and so the promise itself and you can look at joseph's life and see that it was the dreams that he was given that actually made his brothers hate him right why did they hate him because the promise was given to him god chose him to do something and they hated him out of jealousy and that become the irritant in his life you believe god's elected you god chose you and it becomes an irritant but yet god's using that to produce something in your life a pearl big enough to make a gate out of now brother branham he said well could the word be that well when brother branham has that supernatural experience of standing in sabino canyon and a sword strikes his hand you know the story brother brown says if you don't understand spiritual things it may seem very strange but something struck my hand when i looked it was a sword and the handle was made of pearl the prettiest pearl i ever seen and what was the sword the word right it was a king's sword it was the word and it had formed a pearl handle oh my so it is the irritant that transforms the pearl into what it is and brother branham says this and power of transformation because that's the idea is that the pearl is being transformed by the response to the irritant and by the response of the seed to the word is what forms the character of your life and so in power of transformation brother branson said oh if we could only learn that that what part of the word we are we must take our place no matter what it is there's a place for us right it might be brother robert back there running the slides my boy he wants to play the drums so bad but he stuck back on the video but there's a place for you as a christian there's a place for you as a believer there's somewhere where you're supposed to be and we must take our place no matter what it is and brother branham takes this to a little woman that was in a wheelchair a sister in a wheelchair he said i think of a little sister here in the wheelchair sometimes how many faithful prayers has been made over it can you imagine what an irritant it must have been to her to be able to see supernatural miracles constantly across the platform and she went to the tabernacle and remained in a wheelchair and she had to see that over and over again and brother branham says then we don't understand he said so we just committed to god he said and she is a flower here among you with her pleasantness and everything he said see that we can get up and go around how she would long to do that but yet she is pleasant just the way she sits see the irritant does something to the elect that it doesn't do to the others you realize there's many kinds of shells that get irritants in them but it doesn't do to them what it does to certain shells because there's just a response a special response that they have to be able to form a pearl out of that and there's something about the believer that responds in a way that they don't turn out into some old cranky kind of person that can't get along with nobody and nobody's their friend and nobody loves them and all this but what does it make them do it makes them sweeter it makes them kinder it makes them more loving it makes them more like christ what is it the irritant i'm not the shell this is the shell right but the pearls on the inside hey man and as the pearl is it begins to be expressed something begins to take place with it as it transforms it even affects where when you open that up if that shell could ever get cracked open you can see there's something real on the inside now but she said she's pleasant just the way she sits he said i always get inspired to watch the little lady he said because she well he said we all believe in healing we've seen god do miracles far beyond that and she knows that too but she's willing to take her place see whatever it is that's what we want he said and i believe it was david said i'd rather be a doormat at the house of the lord than to dwell in tents with the wicked you see no matter what it is take my place you see sometimes brother brown says you have to separate from everything that's dear on earth to you to take your position that god has called you to he said i'm sure you can read between the lines what i'm saying sometimes the very dearest person on earth you have to shake hands with them and take your position in christ to where god has called you because god may not have called them to the same place we don't all serve in the same place we don't all belong in the same place so sometimes it breaks your heart you got to say bye to people you love because you're called to take a position in christ where god has called you what is god doing he said transforming you from what she was amen he said maybe a daughter or son or whatever it is from a lovely family sometimes he places you somewhere else because it's his way of doing it could i just testify that the word is true today and i know many are watching today and not able to be here but i i can testify that the word is true in my own life i've seen where god would take me from one place to another and i would find that as i do no maybe circumstances would happen and it just i would be removed from one place to another i would feel led to go to a different place than when i did it was always a hard time it was hard to leave those people it's hard to go away from them but i've watched through the years as you leave an influence in different parts and i'm not that old some of you can relate much more to this than i can but as you go different places you leave an influence behind you and when you leave that influence then it follows you even after you're dead the bible teaches your influence follows you but you as you go from place to place your influence follows you and i found that god has allowed me at this season my in my life when was the time i had to leave home and leave my mother and leave my family and god has allowed him to come back around me and be in church with me and there was a time i just testified that god's grace is good it was a time i had to leave a church because i felt led to go somewhere else and and god allowed those people to come right back in their elderly years to come right back and sit among us god does those i believe god's good don't you sometimes he has to move you somewhere else but he's just it's going to be better just trust him today church just trust him he knows what you need don't jump from pillar to post in place to place god knows exactly what you need to make that pearl out of your life i'm testifying that god's grace is good he can do it for you if he's done it if you put god first he will do that in your life amen some of you've been all around the world it seemed like but you ended up back here and already you don't know why but you're here today and you've you stuck it out through thick and thin and you've you've put up with problems and situations and everything else why are you still here because you found your position this is where you belong and because you belong here god will bless you with that now look he said it's god's way of doing it he said see by the renewing of your mind on your mind to obey the word of god regardless of what the price is now he gets down where he gets hard sometimes it hurts to do the right thing not just difficult he said our redemption wasn't a cheap thing it was the son of god had to die for us see things of value come of great price to bring this message he said it wasn't easy an irritant had to be placed in the shell to make it what it was you understand bring this message wasn't easy no it isn't he said i had to forsake everything that was dear to me even my own people everybody but you see the value of it is is to do the will of god and the prophecy was made over brother branham where they spoke about it and he said because you've chosen the harder way you've chosen the harder way you could have taken the easier road but you chose the harder way a great portion of heaven awaits you rare to find someone who will do the will of god who can find a virtuous woman where is that real wife and mother who teaches their children the things of god i'll take that on a spiritual side where is there a church with any strength in it just stand for the word of god oh i believe once we find it we we ought to not give it up you see the virtuous woman not only is she rare is she scarce her value is in that but her value is in that she can be trusted proverbs 31 11 the heart of her husband does safely trust in her so that he shall have no need of spoil she will do him good and not evil all the days of her life he doesn't have to constantly check his bank account to see if she's bankrupted him right and you're taking the literal meaning of the work of the verses in today's language she she doesn't max out all the credit cards on amazon because she knows the money's not there right if it's there you know spend it but but if the money's not there she don't do that she'll do him good and not evil he can trust her that if what she does see she doesn't just take value but she adds value look for friends and especially a spouse that will add value to your life take it away right if if somebody if you're around somebody just constantly complaining just complaining complaining complaining they're they're discontented with every situation they're in they'll never add value to your life but if you can ever get around somebody who just loves people and loves god and and is happy if they don't have nothing but they're happy to be there listen that's the person that that can add value to your life even if they're not wealthy they add a value because it adds positivity to your life which is worth something today and so we could take this again on the spiritual side and say that the bride will not do him evil the bride will do good for him not evil all the days of of the his life all the days of uh that we're with christ we do him good look here's the secret brother brahman says the word is in the bride and the mind of christ to know what he wants done with the word so she takes his resources which is his word right that's his his word it comes from his his inner being of who he is and that is his resource of what he has the value of god is in himself it's not in what he owns or what he has or even what he creates but it's in himself right all those attributes come from god and and that's his value and she doesn't waste his resources right the bride doesn't waste his resources but she knows what he wants done with the word and she does it in his name and she has thus saith the lord so he trusts her to remain true to him amen now so it has value and the virtuous woman also adds value to her family by her works and we'll go through this more quickly but she doesn't work to gain his favor she works because she's a virtuous woman brother brandon taught that faith and works were married they're married if you see one there'll be the other proverbs 31 13 says she seeketh wool and flax and worketh willingly with her hands she is like the merchant ships she bringeth her food from afar she rises also while it is yet night giveth meat to her household and a portion to her maidens and some of you ladies can say i identify with all this sounds like a servant sounds almost like a slave but watch the virtuous woman is not a servant and she's not a slave because the bible also says she considers a field and buys it with the fruit of her hands she planted a vineyard she's not a slave she's a say a business owner right and her business is her family and i've told you i know some women have to work just the day and age that we live in i understand that but if you have to work you've got two jobs right and your first job's always your family that's your first job and it's taking care of your family and so she considers a field and buys it because she's adding value to even what she's required to do right and and now she she plants a vineyard she girdeth her loins with strength and strength strengthens her arms she perceives that her merchandise is good her candle goes not out by night she layeth her hands to the spindle and her hands hold the disc staff she's constantly adding value to her household i don't think it should be just mothers like this or we thank god that they are but it should be all of us right not to be a negative to our house when we walk in it shouldn't be a negative it shouldn't be that you know if you are married and every time you come home it creates a negative atmosphere in the home you probably won't have that for long right because people get tired of living like that right you don't want to be a negative you want to add some value somehow to your home add some value to your church be a part and do everybody can't you know i realized that i used to show up at work days at the church i went to and i realized that i couldn't do much and so for years they had me working getting the birds out of the top of the thing because they knew i didn't like ladders so some of the trustees figured that out and they put me way up in the top of the building getting birds nests on a big long ladder and i hate ladders i climb them real slow and and they put me up there you know knowing that and but i did it you know and i because there wasn't a whole lot else i can do i'm not very handy i talk i don't do so much with this you know but even the working my job was it was in the legal field i didn't and and selling and buying houses and things like that and doing closings i never did i did paperwork i never did much work with my actual hands in that way i'm willing to work but you got to show me what to do right and if i want to build something it's going to it's not going to turn out it's going to turn out about like that that plato baby that my mom made the other day but it's it's gonna you know it's not gonna look very good but but you you can do something right you being there can add value even if they're you think well i can't do much so but you being there can add value you can do something see this is what sarah misunderstood in the promise to abraham sarah thought this is abraham's promise but this was not just abraham's promise because sarah was a part of him and so she misunderstood that and gave him hagar and caused ishmael to be born and causes trouble to this day because she brother branham called it a slightly doubted promise the seed of a slightly doubted promise what is it it's a misunderstanding of her part to play in the whole thing but god later reveals he comes to abraham and he says sarah your wife will have a son amen it won't just be ishmael but it'll be her wife that'll have a part in that and brother branham talks about that when it comes to mankind and he said brother jason i were talking about this yesterday he said that's the reason that god does nothing outside of a man he always works through a man because he had to use man a man is what he had to use to display his attribute of savior he had to make him in his image make him something like him put him on free moral agency let him act any way he wanted to he could take his choice and he knew that man by giving him this choice would fall so being that he had to do that he turns back around and makes the man a partner to him and does nothing except he does it through a man amen he said well i see different things for that but what i see is grace that god will use a man and he used that man jesus christ but he uses us now look proverbs 31 and 20 she stretcheth out her hand to the poor yes she reacheth forth her hands to the needy she's not afraid of the snow for her household for all her householder clothes with scarlet she makes herself coverings of tapestry her clothing is silk and purple her husband is known in the gates when he sitteth among the elders of the land we don't want to get too far into that i don't endorse necessarily husbands sitting while their wives work but what it means is that when he takes his place among the elders he's known because of his wife because a virtuous bride works to make her bridegroom famous something brother stewart said the other night really struck me he said people just want to have the biggest meeting or the biggest church and it really struck me i said god i want my motives to be right i don't want to just have the biggest meeting i don't want to have the biggest church i want to i want to make my husband if you could say it that way i want to make christ famous that should be every one of us we should want to make him famous said that wherever we go he is known right isn't that what our prophet did he didn't make his own name famous what did he do he made christ famous amen for being a healer of the sick for being a savior for being one who could reveal the secrets of the heart he made christ famous what should we do today make him famous amen make him famous in our own home when we sit down with the children make christ famous by the way that we act by the way that we do but the way we treat others amen make him famous hallelujah she doesn't seek the glory she gives it all to him verse 24 she make it final in and encelaeth it delivereth girls under the merchant strength and honor or her clothing she shall rejoice in time to come she realizes it's not all in this life her reward is eternal but she is not a silent partner and i want you to watch this the virtuous woman is not a silent partner sarah called abraham lord but she was not silent far from it now the bible in verse 26 says she openeth her mouth with wisdom and then her tongue is the law of kindness this is part of her value is in speaking right speaking now that's not making her the pastor of a church or something like that but it's speaking and adding value to her household by the words that she says now a mother's voice is the first thing a child will recognize when they're just even in the womb that's what they hear first mother talks to her children and i want to challenge you today if you're a mother or as a christian what does your voice say now think about this for a moment again i i won't hold you very much longer but what will your voice say because the wrong kind of voice will make a child turn against god it's true it'll make him turn against the ministry against the prophet or her turn against the ministry the prophet and ultimately god himself i get that from the scripture you remember the herodias was herod's wife and john the baptist said it's not lawful for you to have her you remember she's kind of a famous woman for being evil in the bible she taught her daughter how to dress how to dance how to attract the attention of men when a mother ought to teach your children the opposite right why would you want your child to attract the attention of a man especially when they're 10 12 years old why would a mother do that it's not right and you've seen it but we won't dwell on that but that's what she did and her daughter finally attracted the attention of her own stepfather and she asked her mother what to do about it how can i take advantage of this and her mother instead of giving her a good spanking tells her she says what shall i ask and she said the head of john the baptist so her voice was used to encourage her daughter to murder a prophet now think about this what does your voice say to your children is it is it using your voice to encourage the murder of a preacher i don't know that that's going on anywhere but just think about that want to be using your voice to encourage the murder of a prophet you can't really believe what he has to say or is it is she using her voice for something else now brother brandon tells us that 70 of her children and grandchildren ended up either in prostitution or in the gallows 70 of them but there was a woman that was in mark chapter 6 where we read about that mark chapter 7 speaks of another woman the sour phoenician woman who spoke something different and she had a young daughter who had an unclean spirit she heard about jesus and came and fell at his feet and the woman was a greek a syrophoenician by nation and she besought him and he would cast forth the devil out of her daughter but jesus said unto her let the children first be filled it is not meat to take the children's bread and to cast it under the dogs he was only going to the lost sheep of the house of israel at that time he said it's not me for me to do that it's not right for me to take the children's bread to cast it to the dogs and she answered and said to him yes lord watch what her voice was used for it was to say amen yes sword oh that's the best thing we could say about him yes lord i believe that what you're saying is true even if it hurts me even if it if it makes me feel bad even if i realize i'm not doing everything right yes sword yes lord i believe your word is true yes sword i want my kids to serve god even if i maybe i have a personal issue with the preacher or with somebody else in the church or something but i won't quit why i want my voice to my children to be yes lord yes sword amen and she said yes sword yes the dogs she wasn't afraid to speak for what she had a need of yet the dogs under the table eat of the children's crumbs and he saith unto her for this saying go thy way for this saying go that way for the saying of herodias her family ended up destituting and and despairing on the gallows but for the saying of the sour phoenician woman her daughter was healed hallelujah the bible said when she was come to her house she found the devil going out and her daughter laid on the bed don't make the bright speech of no value i'll read part of this and and i'm sorry brother robert we'll skip through this because i'm out of time but in the laodicean church age brother branham talks about how the prophet would be god's mouthpiece as it's declared in malachi 4. and he says he will restore the truth as they had it in that next quote and and he said and those elect with him in that day will be the ones who truly manifest the lord and be his body and be his voice and perform his works huh she's not a silent partner but she don't speak unless he speaks right he said he talks about church history and how the lutheran spoke for god at one time and about the wesleyans and how that they spoke for god at one time he said and when the methodist failed god raised up others and so it has gone on through the years until in this last day there is again another people in the land amen under their messenger will be the final voice to the final age he said yes sir the church is no longer the mouthpiece of god is it is its own mouthpiece so god is turning on her he will confound her through the prophet and the bride for the voice of god will be in her he said yes it is for it says in the last chapter of revelation verse 17 the spirit and the bride say come once more the world will hear direct from god think about that the world will hear direct from god when the bride speaks because they're saying what the messenger said and he said what god said amen it's not that they don't speak they do speak and the world hears direct from god like they did at pentecost but of course the word bride will be repudiated as in the first stage the world won't accept it but they'll hear it she has value in her speech proverbs 31 27 she looks well to the ways of her household edith not the bread of idleness verse 28 her children rise up call her blessed and her husband also and he praiseth her verse 29 many daughters have done virtuously but alex thou excelis them all verse 30 favor is deceitful beauty is vain a cultured pearl can have beauty a woman that feareth the lord she shall be praised give her the fruit of her hands let her own works praise her in the gates what does god have to say about that kind of a bride musicians go ahead and come what does he have to say how does god value because that's ultimately the test of value because people are willing to pay large amounts of things that you know someone i think paid over a million dollars for one of those suits that elvis wore i'll be honest with you i don't want one especially if it hasn't been washed since he wore it i just no desire to have one of those suits and pay millions of dollars so beauty's in the eye of the beholder and there's got to be value in in in the eye of a person who knows what he's doing right not just any old guy but somebody who knows value he knows value how does he value the bride as we close this morning on this mother's day how does god value the bride she's a pearl of great price he gave up all of heaven when he found the pearl to purchase her amen zephaniah 3 and 16 speaks of the way god thinks and think about it puts it in human terms but just so you get it zephaniah 3 and 16 how he thinks about jerusalem or zion which is a type of the bride he said in that day it shall be said to jerusalem fear thou not and desire let not thy hands to be sacked the lord thy god in the midst of thee is mighty he will save he will rejoice over thee with joy he will rest in his love he will joy over thee with singing have you ever thought about that what does god sing about if god's saying what would he sing about you sing about god what would god sing about you it says he will rest in his love he will joy over there he was singing that word joy if you go back in the original is literally he spins around which is the kind of dance that they would have done in that day and the people would have understood that god was dancing and singing how much do you value your wife sometimes she's just so beautiful the mother of your children so beautiful that you want to just dance and sing maybe you better not but may not be something she'd value very much but he said i will rejoice over you with joy it just makes me want to move hallelujah oh i don't believe in dancing in the church well there it is this virtuous bride is so valuable that the bridegroom when she comes to her proper place and i believe this is the hour for that he dances and sings in her presence what should you do what kind of an outlook should you have hebrews 12 and 1 wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses let us lay aside every way and the sin which just so easily beset us let us run with patience the race that is set before us looking unto jesus the author and finisher of our faith who for the joy that was set before him because he was so looking forward to that to having that moment when he could sing over his bride he despised the shame endured the cross and is set down at the right hand of the throne of god could we bow our heads together either here this morning you that are watching do you realize what kind of value he's placed in you today you are so valuable that he's the bible says he bowed the heavens he bent he stretched himself into a body of flesh he came down into a baby in a manger lived and died and was crucified and rose again on the third day the death burial and resurrection of christ so that he thought so much of you so that you could be saved what do you think of him today do you value him do you look forward to that joy if he would dance and sing if you would come to him today would you have joy in his presence i believe there's joy when you realize he's there maybe you've never given your heart to christ you'd like to do that this morning now's the time maybe you're a christian today that you've never really really for a long time maybe you you've kind of begrudgingly served god don't do that you're not a silent partner you don't have to be miserable all the time find the joy of christ get into the word of god find the joy of god and serve him because you want to tell my mother it's so wonderful to look forward to the services this week i know it'll be hard work but i'm looking forward to it so much because i just want to be in the presence of god's people and i want to see what god does i just can't wait to see what god does because i believe that he when two or three are gathered together he said i will be there in the midst but you know i feel like that about sunday morning wednesday nights i want to be there because i just can't wait to see what he's going to do next you want that kind of joy in your heart and in your life and looking forward to the things of god would you just ask god to give that to you today and don't take a great something but just a just a request do you care he cares about you he cares enough to dance and sing if if he had human emotions that he would be dancing and singing before you he cares that much about you would you care about him today heavenly father lord i pray that you would just move and all those that are watching those that are sick today some that were traveling i pray god that you would bless each and every one of them i pray especially for our mothers today i pray that you'd come and that you that you just give them a special feeling of your care and your love for them i pray lord that you would move in these meetings coming up lord i believe you can bring souls to you
