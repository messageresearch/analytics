[44:27] and it's good to have brother Chris with
[44:28] us amen I uh would have liked to have
[44:31] heard him sing but uh uh how wants to
[44:35] hear him sing sometime again soon amen
[44:38] praise the Lord I really like the way he
[44:40] sings and puts his heart into it and he
[44:44] drives a long ways and he's going to uh
[44:47] uh the school there at Liberty
[44:50] University and uh he certainly I'm sure
[44:52] he appreciates our prayers for him while
[44:54] he's there and
[44:56] that the Lord will help him to uh
[44:58] accomplish the uh goal and the uh
[45:02] objective that he has for his life the
[45:06] Lord will lead him and direct him amen
[45:09] Bible says the footsteps of the
[45:10] righteous are ordered of the Lord I
[45:12] guess if I was going to become a nurse
[45:14] or a doctor I would have to take the
[45:17] requirements to in order to become that
[45:20] amen and praise the Lord I believe that
[45:23] we are on the right Road tonight don't
[45:25] you amen amen we I won't keep you
[45:27] standing um so it's good to be able to
[45:31] share with you I certainly enjoy brother
[45:34] Terry's uh service this morning and um
[45:37] things he said there on Israel I wrote
[45:40] down a bunch of things uh that uh I'll
[45:44] have to talk to him about not that I was
[45:46] disagreeing with him or anything like
[45:48] that but I just uh it was it was just
[45:51] something there's a lot a lot there and
[45:53] maybe sometime brother ter will pre
[45:55] preaches a whole bunch of stuff on
[45:58] Israel and the history of the Jews in
[46:01] the last 2,000
[46:03] years
[46:05] uh it's one
[46:07] people that exists today very very few
[46:12] others exist you know you speak to I
[46:14] speak about the
[46:16] Assyrians they're actually still in
[46:18] existence believe it or not but they're
[46:21] no longer that mighty nation that they
[46:23] once were and I often and wonder why
[46:26] they still exist and I wonder just a
[46:30] thought but you know God actually sent
[46:32] the
[46:33] Assyrians
[46:38] Jonah something think about that they
[46:41] were the most wickedest cruelest
[46:44] people that came against Israel and they
[46:47] were very warlike they mistreated their
[46:50] enemies they were very Wicked evil
[46:53] people for their time and uh I spoke on
[46:57] it one time here at the church but there
[46:59] was something in the Bible where one of
[47:02] their generals came down there and
[47:04] mocked the people of God I believe it
[47:07] was uh one of the Kings there in the
[47:10] city and he mocked him and then what he
[47:13] was saying was there was a lot of Truth
[47:15] in what he was saying that they had
[47:18] destroyed many of the other nations and
[47:21] that was a fact and of course it was a
[47:24] lot of flattery and that and so forth
[47:27] but thanks be to
[47:29] God the king believed the report of the
[47:33] Lord and even though he was frightened
[47:38] and shaken knowing that this man and his
[47:41] army had done thus and thus but he was
[47:45] facing a different group of people this
[47:48] time he was facing God's people amen so
[47:51] I'm not going to be speaking on that
[47:52] tonight but there were certainly a lot
[47:54] of things that brother Terry brought out
[47:56] there about the Jews and their current
[47:59] history uh ongoing history and history
[48:02] in the making um praise the Lord so this
[48:05] evening I want you to turn with me to
[48:07] the book of
[48:08] Isaiah 65 I thought I would read this
[48:11] because it uh really deals somewhat with
[48:14] the subject of what I like to speak on
[48:17] tonight Isaiah 65 beginning at verse 17
[48:22] and we're going to read on down to uh
[48:24] verse 23
[48:27] and uh I want you to take notice to some
[48:30] of these verses that uh uh point to a a
[48:35] new type of
[48:38] living a new type of living of course
[48:41] you know well say brother Amos you know
[48:44] new Heavens A New Earth uh that's going
[48:47] to be a new type of living but I want
[48:49] you to notice there's going to be some
[48:51] things
[48:52] absent amen amen
[48:56] Isaiah 65:1 17 for behold I create new
[48:59] heavens and a new Earth that the former
[49:02] shall not be
[49:03] remembered I want you to notice that and
[49:06] I want you to write that I want you to
[49:09] let that soak into your mind from one
[49:11] end of between these both ears up and
[49:15] down every which way I want you to
[49:18] remember that and the
[49:21] former shall not be remembered nor come
[49:26] into
[49:28] mind Verse 18 but be ye glad and rejoice
[49:35] forever in that which I create for
[49:37] behold I create
[49:40] Jerusalem a more of a dead
[49:43] Church no a
[49:46] rejoicing and her people a
[49:50] joy I Will Rejoice now this is the Lord
[49:53] speaking through the prophet Isaiah
[49:56] here in verse 19 and I will rejoice in
[49:58] Jerusalem and joy in my people and the
[50:02] voice of
[50:04] weeping shall be no more heard in her
[50:08] nor the voice of the
[50:11] crying there shall be no more then an
[50:14] infant of
[50:15] days in other words a young child comes
[50:19] to an untimely
[50:21] death no more then in infinite days nor
[50:24] an old man hath not filled his days for
[50:27] the child should die in 100 years old
[50:29] The Sinner being 100 years old shall be
[50:33] accursed he said nor an old man that
[50:36] hath not filled his days an untimely an
[50:40] untimely
[50:41] death and they shall build houses and
[50:45] inhabit them
[50:47] amen plant Vineyards and eat the fruit
[50:50] of
[50:51] them they shall not build another
[50:54] inhabit
[50:56] they shall not plant and another eat for
[50:59] as the days of a tree are the days of my
[51:02] people and mine elect shall
[51:05] long enjoy the work of their
[51:10] hands they shall not labor in vain nor
[51:13] bring forth for trouble for they are the
[51:18] seed of the
[51:20] Blessed of the Lord and their offspring
[51:23] with them amen I'd also like you to turn
[51:26] over to the book of uh
[51:34] Hebrews chapter 8 and verse
[51:38] 12 and I will be
[51:41] reading three verses there and then
[51:44] we'll go to Hebrews 9 and 14 and then
[51:47] Hebrews 10 and read three verses
[51:51] there he says for I will be merciful to
[51:54] their
[51:56] unrighteousness and their sins and
[51:58] iniquities I will remember no
[52:02] more Hebrews 9
[52:05] and12 neither by the blood of goats and
[52:09] calves but by his own blood he entered
[52:12] in once into the holy Place having
[52:15] obtained Eternal Redemption for us for
[52:19] if the blood of bulls and of goats and
[52:21] the ashes of an hepher sprinkling the
[52:24] unclean
[52:25] sanctifying sanctify to the purifying of
[52:28] the flesh how much more shall the blood
[52:31] of Christ who through the eternal spirit
[52:35] offered himself without spot to God
[52:38] Purge your conscience from dead Works to
[52:41] serve the Living
[52:43] God Hebrews
[52:45] 10:1 for the law having a
[52:49] shadow of good things to come and not
[52:53] the very image of the things can never
[52:55] with those
[52:57] sacrifices which they offered year by
[52:59] year continually make the comers there
[53:02] unto
[53:03] perfect for then would they not have
[53:06] ceased to be
[53:07] offered because that the worshippers
[53:10] once
[53:11] purged should have had no more
[53:15] Consciousness should have no more
[53:17] conscience of
[53:19] sins but in those
[53:22] sacrifices there is Remembrance
[53:26] again made of sins every
[53:30] year no more conscience of
[53:34] sins I want to speak to you tonight on
[53:37] the the the subject of the new book and
[53:40] subtitling it forgotten
[53:44] examples forgotten examples you can be
[53:49] seated Lord Jesus we just bow our heads
[53:52] and our
[53:53] hearts Lord don't open this W book as
[53:56] we've already read we pray you would
[53:58] bless these things that you've laid upon
[54:01] our heart in Jesus Christ name
[54:05] amen amen the new book forgotten
[54:11] examples we how many of us tonight we
[54:14] believe that's God's
[54:18] word we believe it it's absolutely God's
[54:21] word to us
[54:23] amen now now we we
[54:27] realize here in Jeremiah which Hebrews 8
[54:30] and12 was merely Paul was repeating what
[54:36] Jeremiah said in 31 and 34 and they
[54:38] shall teach no more every man his
[54:41] neighbor and every man his brother
[54:43] saying know the Lord for they shall all
[54:46] know me from the least of them unto the
[54:49] greatest of them sayeth the Lord for I
[54:52] will forgive their iniquity and I will
[54:54] remember
[54:55] there sin no more amen now uh I would
[55:00] like you to turn with me and I think
[55:02] what we'll do is uh we'll go right
[55:12] to that I believe will be a help to us
[55:16] tonight the Lord will help
[55:20] us amen
[55:24] amen
[55:30] he says
[55:31] here Hebrews 11:1 now Faith is the
[55:35] substance of things hoped for the
[55:37] evidence of Things Not
[55:40] Seen and then jump down to Hebrews 11
[55:43] and5 by faith Enoch was translated that
[55:47] he should not see death and was not
[55:49] found because God had translated him for
[55:54] before his translation he had this
[55:57] testimony that he
[55:59] pleased God
[56:02] am and then we read this in following in
[56:05] the verse six Paul says but without
[56:08] faith it is impossible to please him for
[56:12] he that cometh to God must believe that
[56:16] he is he's a rewarder of them that
[56:19] diligently seek
[56:22] him
[56:23] now
[56:25] how many believes
[56:27] tonight that you are absolutely a child
[56:32] of
[56:34] God and that all your
[56:38] previous sins prior to your
[56:42] conversion prior to your new
[56:45] birth are no longer in
[56:53] existence
[56:56] you've got to believe
[56:59] that amen I don't know that there's one
[57:02] person in here tonight including myself
[57:06] or anyone else for that fact that's ever
[57:08] stood behind this Pulpit or sat in his
[57:12] pews could
[57:16] say
[57:18] that their sins have not been dealt with
[57:22] if they've claimed to be a Christian
[57:28] I believe with all my
[57:30] heart what the word says about
[57:36] me now there is every person that has
[57:39] walked in this building as I said with
[57:42] the
[57:47] past and I'm not even trying to dig that
[57:50] up because I don't have the nature and
[57:54] the
[57:55] desire to dig up people's
[57:59] past unless they're hiding
[58:05] something unless they claim something
[58:08] that they don't
[58:10] possess and I say to that person come
[58:15] clean this Pulpit is designed for one
[58:18] thing it's so that the book of Our
[58:22] Lives if we're not Christians
[58:26] is that our book of our life to be
[58:29] opened and that the Lord says when that
[58:32] book is open come now let us reason
[58:35] together sayeth the Lord though your
[58:37] sins be as Scarlet though they be red as
[58:41] Crimson they shall be white as snow
[58:44] white as
[58:45] wool this is not a place of
[58:48] condemnation this is not a building
[58:51] where we preach people into hell we
[58:55] preach people to a
[58:57] Reconciliation and a
[58:59] recognization that without Christ you're
[59:02] lost without the
[59:05] manifestation the revealing of the
[59:08] Redemption plan to your heart and soul
[59:11] and that you make a
[59:13] decision you're
[59:16] sick the Bible says judgment must first
[59:18] begin at the house of the
[59:22] Lord now that's what this place is
[59:26] yeah this is a place of
[59:31] Correction it's a place it's also a
[59:35] birthing
[59:37] place this is
[59:39] where the the the uh where the word is
[59:44] sown the seed is sown it's also where
[59:47] it's conceived and it's also where it's
[59:51] birthed
[59:53] Hallelujah aren't you thankful for a
[59:55] House of
[59:56] Mercy aren't you thankful we're not
[59:59] looking for judgment the Bible says that
[1:00:02] we're pass from Death un
[1:00:05] life amen we're no longer living out
[1:00:09] under the dread fear of fatalism to
[1:00:12] think that our Doom is somewhere down
[1:00:14] the road and if you are living like that
[1:00:16] that's nothing that's what the devil
[1:00:19] wants you to live he wants you to live
[1:00:21] in fear and
[1:00:23] torment
[1:00:26] God wants you to have absolute
[1:00:29] peace he wants you to have a new
[1:00:33] life but there's a sin problem that's
[1:00:36] got to be dealt with and we know that
[1:00:39] that's what he is here to do for us is
[1:00:42] to change our lives to change our souls
[1:00:46] to take away the old
[1:00:48] man now we we come from all different
[1:00:52] backgrounds brother brandham made this
[1:00:55] statement so many times I think the last
[1:00:57] time I spoke was up there in
[1:00:59] Pennsylvania and and brother Rand made
[1:01:01] this statement so many times that since
[1:01:04] the opening of those
[1:01:06] seals the Bible has become a new
[1:01:12] book now I'm going to make a statement
[1:01:16] tonight I've made these statements and
[1:01:18] people will think oh my maybe he's
[1:01:20] preaching false Doctrine or he's and it
[1:01:23] is your right
[1:01:25] to uh make sure I pray for the hand of
[1:01:29] God of
[1:01:30] Correction I don't stand up here without
[1:01:33] uh a possibility of not committing an
[1:01:35] error making a mistake that is not my
[1:01:38] intent to be wrong my intent is to bring
[1:01:43] forth the word not put my own
[1:01:45] interpretation to it but now based upon
[1:01:49] what the word says about
[1:01:51] us now if this thing is
[1:01:56] retroactive I'm maybe moving ahead a
[1:01:59] little bit further than faster than what
[1:02:02] uh I want it to right now but if this
[1:02:04] thing is retroactive all the way back to
[1:02:08] the Garden of
[1:02:09] Eden then I can tell you in this book
[1:02:13] there's a written
[1:02:15] record but I want you to know in God's
[1:02:18] book there is no written record of Eve's
[1:02:22] fall or Adam's fall
[1:02:28] now i r read to you that is your sins is
[1:02:32] cast into the sea of his
[1:02:35] forgetfulness I read he said your sins
[1:02:38] and iniquities I will remember no
[1:02:42] more now if it's only good for us today
[1:02:46] then he's not the same yesterday today
[1:02:48] and
[1:02:51] forever that's why the prophet said it's
[1:02:54] a new book you read it with a
[1:02:59] revelation of this
[1:03:08] message now
[1:03:10] Adam was down there in
[1:03:13] Paradise he was
[1:03:15] there Samson was there David was
[1:03:20] there Elijah was
[1:03:23] there or
[1:03:26] Elisha it was when
[1:03:29] Saul King Saul called for him that
[1:03:32] time but look at all the
[1:03:38] situations that all the Old Testament
[1:03:41] Saints the situations you read
[1:03:44] about the errors they
[1:03:48] committed you know and and how they some
[1:03:51] of them were quite uh I'm looking for
[1:03:54] the right word for but some of them were
[1:03:56] really really
[1:03:57] bad they were really
[1:04:00] wicked what it was it was the
[1:04:03] enemy who was moving on them and they
[1:04:06] different personalities that's why many
[1:04:09] of these things and I'm so glad that
[1:04:11] there is a
[1:04:12] masterpiece that'll fit every puzzle of
[1:04:15] your
[1:04:15] life I don't really say that in the
[1:04:18] context of brother Brandon preaching the
[1:04:20] Masterpiece but I found that quote just
[1:04:22] recently within that sermon
[1:04:24] take master and peace and separate him
[1:04:28] there's a master key that'll open every
[1:04:31] lock and there's a
[1:04:34] masterpiece that'll fit every situation
[1:04:38] of any life there is a master blood
[1:04:42] that'll take care of any sin problem
[1:04:45] that a person might have it's a master
[1:04:48] blood it'll fit whatever the conflict is
[1:04:52] whatever the sin
[1:04:54] is it'll remove it and there is a
[1:04:59] fire that will
[1:05:01] destroy the old
[1:05:03] man and not just live in a state of
[1:05:07] divorcement but where the old man
[1:05:11] dies and the new
[1:05:13] man in Christ Jesus
[1:05:16] resurrected the soul is elevated without
[1:05:20] the sin nature because the sin nature of
[1:05:22] the old man is eliminated
[1:05:29] now do
[1:05:31] we or do we
[1:05:33] not
[1:05:35] believe the
[1:05:37] quotes and the
[1:05:39] scriptures do we or do we
[1:05:42] [Laughter]
[1:05:49] not as long as I am in this body and
[1:05:53] mind
[1:05:54] it's going to be a
[1:05:56] battle but it's not going to be a
[1:05:59] defeating battle it's going to be a
[1:06:02] battle that's going to lead me stronger
[1:06:05] and more res res Resolute in my
[1:06:08] faith cuz though Abraham got older and
[1:06:13] older and older and I just read
[1:06:17] tonight something that I did not know
[1:06:19] about
[1:06:20] Abraham he was
[1:06:23] sterile and Eve not Eve but
[1:06:27] Sarah
[1:06:29] was also a
[1:06:32] baron so both of them had an
[1:06:38] issue uh I've read this quote and I want
[1:06:43] to I want you
[1:06:45] to be able to hear what the prophet says
[1:06:47] about it you just pardon me a minute
[1:06:50] while I find it up here brother brand
[1:06:53] made some
[1:06:55] some amazing
[1:06:57] statements about Abraham and
[1:07:01] Sarah in this
[1:07:04] message you know I've got something to
[1:07:06] back this up I'm not just saying this or
[1:07:09] making it up brother brandham in 1958 in
[1:07:12] April the 6th I know my redeemer liveth
[1:07:15] brother Bram says
[1:07:17] this he says how it was an assurance to
[1:07:20] Abraham after he had found God and know
[1:07:24] that God had a purpose that in his
[1:07:26] purpose he was going to bring through
[1:07:28] Abraham and Sarah a
[1:07:30] son
[1:07:32] okay and through this son Isaac was
[1:07:35] going to come the Lord
[1:07:36] Jesus and in this purpose he was
[1:07:39] bringing for
[1:07:41] Sarah and
[1:07:43] Abraham okay and was going to make them
[1:07:46] a great people oh yeah everybody whoa
[1:07:48] yeah yeah praise
[1:07:50] God and bring this
[1:07:52] son
[1:07:54] and then brother Rand just kind of
[1:07:57] stops and his the spirit leads him to
[1:08:01] say these
[1:08:02] words he says and bring this son dot dot
[1:08:06] dot taking the very worst persons that
[1:08:12] could be to do it
[1:08:14] with did you hear what I just read to
[1:08:17] you we we somehow because of the great
[1:08:21] fact you know Abraham stag not the pro
[1:08:24] of God and that's
[1:08:25] true but we also forget he
[1:08:28] lied he misrepresented his wife as his
[1:08:32] sister because he had
[1:08:35] fear fear was ruling on the throne of
[1:08:38] his heart
[1:08:40] temporarily he had
[1:08:46] issues and and there were several other
[1:08:49] things I think that happened there look
[1:08:51] at
[1:08:52] Sarah we put them up on pedestals but
[1:08:55] you know what and this is I take
[1:08:58] consolation in this because I realize
[1:09:01] these were people oh they didn't come
[1:09:03] from a long line of a long family Legacy
[1:09:06] that goes way back you know and how
[1:09:08] people say oh I could trace my roots
[1:09:11] back to this certain king of this Castle
[1:09:14] over there in Europe or something like
[1:09:17] that like I'm supposed to be
[1:09:20] impressed I had a fell to telling me
[1:09:23] always he said found out my last name I
[1:09:25] won't tell you what the last name was
[1:09:27] but he said I found out it was related
[1:09:29] my great great great great this was this
[1:09:33] some great sea captain and boy he was
[1:09:35] blowing it
[1:09:38] off and I
[1:09:41] thought well I better not
[1:09:45] say and you see we we put Abraham and
[1:09:49] Sarah on that because why you know and
[1:09:51] they bu you know make these statu using
[1:09:54] and so forth and it the sculptor will or
[1:09:57] the artist will try to paint a picture
[1:10:01] of an image of what they
[1:10:04] think Abraham would look
[1:10:09] like but you know what if you could
[1:10:12] really see the
[1:10:14] image of
[1:10:19] Abraham it probably would not be that
[1:10:22] impressive
[1:10:26] because if God ever he says God takes
[1:10:29] the nothings and I'll read it to you God
[1:10:33] likes to take something that isn't
[1:10:36] nothing and make something out of it
[1:10:39] does that I I don't know about you but I
[1:10:41] feel I'm a nothing I was absolutely a
[1:10:46] nothing I tend to compare myself with
[1:10:48] others many times I know God has created
[1:10:52] individuality you're you brother Tim as
[1:10:54] an individual and are you brother Bill
[1:10:56] sister sister sister and brother you're
[1:10:59] all individuals we're all important to
[1:11:03] God but yet we're
[1:11:07] nobody's we're
[1:11:10] lost whether you be king or poer makes
[1:11:14] no difference whether you be president
[1:11:17] or the guy that is
[1:11:21] janitor we're all in the same both
[1:11:24] together in need of a
[1:11:28] savior little there is no such thing as
[1:11:31] a good good boy
[1:11:34] sinner they're all bad Sinners all have
[1:11:38] sin and come short of the glory of God
[1:11:41] sorry you don't measure up hate to bust
[1:11:44] your
[1:11:44] bubble oh by the time we get done night
[1:11:47] I might think well I thought I was such
[1:11:49] a pretty good guy till brother Amos just
[1:11:51] burst my bubble well I got mind burst
[1:11:54] and I want to keep it
[1:11:56] burst anything good that be said about
[1:11:59] me because I surrendered to the Lord and
[1:12:02] it's all because of him anyway it's all
[1:12:05] because of his Mercy I wasn't seeking
[1:12:07] God he was seeking me he was seeking
[1:12:11] you I didn't really care at one time
[1:12:14] about God I didn't really have a concern
[1:12:17] but one day the Holy Spirit begin to
[1:12:19] deal with my heart and I thank God amen
[1:12:24] that I had that
[1:12:25] dealing I thank God that he
[1:12:29] persisted and he didn't walk away from
[1:12:31] me amen I thank God he didn't give up on
[1:12:34] me why because I believe now I believe
[1:12:38] that I was part of
[1:12:40] him Hallelujah but then you couldn't
[1:12:43] have told me I
[1:12:44] was matter of fact I went through stages
[1:12:47] in my life where I thought I could be
[1:12:48] lost now that's the ignorance of the
[1:12:51] word that's why we needed a message Amen
[1:12:56] to tell us that once you're a part of
[1:12:58] his sheep you weren't you didn't become
[1:13:00] a sheep you always were a
[1:13:03] sheep we we needed a message to tell us
[1:13:07] these
[1:13:08] things that's
[1:13:11] right he said that's he said make
[1:13:13] something out of it he's a Creator
[1:13:15] that's why he took you and I we were
[1:13:17] nothing that he might make children of
[1:13:19] of his own out of us who were wretched
[1:13:21] and miserable and lost and blind and
[1:13:23] lovely to make us his lovely children
[1:13:28] it's God's purpose to do
[1:13:30] so and then again it looked like God
[1:13:33] would have taken a young woman and a
[1:13:34] young man to have done this a young
[1:13:36] woman young man who just been
[1:13:40] married he would have said now you have
[1:13:42] no children I'm going to have you your
[1:13:45] firstborn your first son to be a born
[1:13:48] and he's going to be my Isaac but God
[1:13:51] chose a man 75 years old
[1:13:54] and a woman's 65 10 years
[1:13:57] difference to do his
[1:13:59] purpose to show that you can be both
[1:14:01] young or old God can still and
[1:14:04] will work out his purpose
[1:14:09] certainly I go on to say more about that
[1:14:11] and I've got a little bit more on that
[1:14:14] quote but
[1:14:17] now we have a written
[1:14:20] record and here in the book of
[1:14:22] Corinthians uh see if I can find that
[1:14:24] real quickly where Paul makes mention of
[1:14:29] this in 1 Corinthians chapter 10 we read
[1:14:37] this 1 Corinthians chapter 10 and verse
[1:14:40] one I'll just read back up there and
[1:14:43] we'll read through this you all have it
[1:14:46] say
[1:14:48] Amen 1 Corinthians 10:1 moreover
[1:14:51] Brethren and would not that you would be
[1:14:53] ignorant how that all F how that all our
[1:14:57] fathers were under the cloud and all
[1:14:59] passed through the
[1:15:03] sea and were all baptized un Moses in
[1:15:06] the cloud and in the sea did all eat the
[1:15:09] same spiritual
[1:15:11] meat and did all drink the same
[1:15:13] spiritual
[1:15:15] drink for they drank of that spiritual
[1:15:17] rock that followed them and that rock
[1:15:19] was Christ now notice what he says here
[1:15:22] in 1 Corinthians 10 and
[1:15:24] 5 but with many of them God was not well
[1:15:31] pleased he was not well pleased what
[1:15:35] does it say in Hebrews without faith
[1:15:39] it's impossible to please him so what
[1:15:42] happened here there was a lack of faith
[1:15:46] matter of fact it was unbelief that went
[1:15:48] on display so God was not well pleased
[1:15:51] for they were over thrown in the
[1:15:55] wilderness and then he says in verse six
[1:15:57] now these things were our examples to
[1:16:00] the intent we should not lust after evil
[1:16:03] things as they also lusted I want to
[1:16:06] stop right here and say one
[1:16:08] thing those
[1:16:10] people had an open
[1:16:14] book their sin was called to be reckoned
[1:16:17] upon their sin they were called upon to
[1:16:21] believe what they had in their heart was
[1:16:24] Faith to start with but then they
[1:16:27] allowed unbelief to come in and because
[1:16:30] of that they were overthrown in the
[1:16:33] wilderness they lost their
[1:16:37] position now I don't know about you but
[1:16:39] brother Terry mentioned that this
[1:16:40] morning and every time I've heard
[1:16:42] this I don't know about
[1:16:46] you here you had a generation that came
[1:16:49] out of
[1:16:51] Egypt that seen most Moses performed
[1:16:54] these
[1:16:55] signs seeing Egyptians die left and
[1:16:59] right cattle what have you Liv
[1:17:01] stock Grievious things happened upon
[1:17:05] Egypt and they put the blood over the
[1:17:08] doorpost some of these very same
[1:17:11] people and they left their bondages and
[1:17:14] God mightily delivers through the
[1:17:17] opening of the Red
[1:17:18] Sea and they see all these
[1:17:21] things and then they begin to murmur and
[1:17:23] complain and finally God says I've had
[1:17:27] enough imagine that
[1:17:30] generation think about the fact that
[1:17:35] some of the very ones that were down
[1:17:37] there slaving away in Egypt was praying
[1:17:40] for
[1:17:41] deliverance and then the Deliverance
[1:17:43] comes and then they walk with the
[1:17:46] deliverance and at some point they begin
[1:17:50] to
[1:17:52] disbelieve and finally God says that is
[1:17:56] it they cross the
[1:18:00] line here is a nation that God has put
[1:18:04] fear into the hearts of all the nations
[1:18:08] around and the word gets out what
[1:18:10] happened to Egypt and how the Red Sea
[1:18:12] opened up and swallowed up pharaoh and
[1:18:14] his
[1:18:16] CHS these very people who
[1:18:20] participate not spectators but
[1:18:23] participated in the Deliverance or
[1:18:26] overthrown because of their
[1:18:29] unbelief and let's take that a step
[1:18:34] further now I'll be honest with
[1:18:37] you this is really heavy what I'm about
[1:18:40] to
[1:18:42] say but you know the Pharisees came up
[1:18:44] and said to Jesus our father's in the
[1:18:48] wilderness and Jesus turned to him and
[1:18:51] said and then they are everyone
[1:18:57] dead now the prophet tells
[1:19:01] us when Jesus said
[1:19:04] that they weren't just dead in the
[1:19:08] grave they were
[1:19:10] dead in sins and
[1:19:13] trespasses and had gone beyond the veil
[1:19:17] of this life into death into another
[1:19:20] dimension to where there was no
[1:19:25] salvation for
[1:19:29] them can you
[1:19:31] imagine can you
[1:19:34] imagine I
[1:19:35] can't but at the white Throne
[1:19:39] judgment when these
[1:19:41] Jews come up before the throne and
[1:19:44] they're
[1:19:46] lost nearly 2
[1:19:49] million and just a handful that we know
[1:19:51] of went in in to the promised land and
[1:19:56] they had to stand there and they see the
[1:20:01] Lord your God Deuteronomy 18:15 sitting
[1:20:03] there on the throne fulfilled the judge
[1:20:10] yeah have a lot to answer for and that
[1:20:15] Canaanite tribe who was probably at one
[1:20:17] time walked with God because many of
[1:20:19] those Canaanite tribes were actually
[1:20:22] sons of Abraham
[1:20:23] didn't know that did you that's right
[1:20:27] many of those Heathen tribes that dwelt
[1:20:30] in Canaan some of them were actually
[1:20:34] descendants of the
[1:20:36] sons of
[1:20:39] Abraham they know that when you study
[1:20:43] you study these
[1:20:45] things that's why the Bible said the
[1:20:48] iniquity of the amorites was not yet
[1:20:51] full see God God was being
[1:20:54] merciful he says I won't bring judgment
[1:20:57] on them but when they cross that line
[1:21:00] then the iniquity of the amorites will
[1:21:02] be full I gave them chance to
[1:21:05] repent and these were no doubt people at
[1:21:07] one time they were fervent Believers of
[1:21:10] Jehovah God though they were not of
[1:21:12] Isaac's line they were not the promised
[1:21:15] son but they were given opportunity to
[1:21:18] walk in the light of Abraham and they
[1:21:20] wandered away and begin to worship other
[1:21:23] Gods God gave said I'll do away with
[1:21:26] that group they're
[1:21:29] cursed and I'll give their land to my
[1:21:36] people
[1:21:37] God has a reason for the things that he
[1:21:42] has people to
[1:21:43] do you see we even even today that's
[1:21:48] that's a tough one for me to swallow is
[1:21:51] the fact that
[1:21:53] God told them to slay all of
[1:21:56] them now if it's up to
[1:21:59] me I'd be trying to give people show
[1:22:02] people Mercy I'm glad I didn't live in
[1:22:04] that hour when I believe God would have
[1:22:07] helped
[1:22:08] me but there's one thing about
[1:22:12] it God had a reason for
[1:22:14] that he don't he don't take a man to
[1:22:18] that kind of judgment unless he's
[1:22:20] actually warn them
[1:22:25] see that's what the opening of the seals
[1:22:27] is CA us we have the mind of Christ now
[1:22:29] we're beginning to understand these
[1:22:31] things that's
[1:22:34] right who would have ever thought and I
[1:22:37] mentioned here in this group of people
[1:22:39] still on the Earth today and they know
[1:22:41] their background they know where they
[1:22:42] come from as far as their spiritual
[1:22:45] condition is concerned that's another
[1:22:47] question but the
[1:22:49] Assyrians they still claim an Assyrian
[1:22:53] Nation they were nearly wiped out by the
[1:22:56] Arab population back in the 1900s and a
[1:22:59] British general who had the British army
[1:23:02] was all over the world in Middle East at
[1:23:04] that time came to the rescue and spared
[1:23:08] them from
[1:23:12] Annihilation now that's to me
[1:23:15] that's a wonder you know brother Rand
[1:23:18] the Bible said Jesus said at the day of
[1:23:21] judgment the men of
[1:23:23] Neva will raise up and condemn this
[1:23:28] generation you don't find anywhere any
[1:23:31] of the prophets outside of Jonah if you
[1:23:33] can find one go ahead and give it to
[1:23:36] me you cannot find one place where it
[1:23:39] was ever promised during the old under
[1:23:42] the Old Testament that was ever
[1:23:45] prophesied that God was going to show
[1:23:47] Mercy to a group of people called the
[1:23:51] nites you can't find
[1:23:54] it it's only when God raised up a man
[1:23:58] called Jonah a Jewish Prophet to go to a
[1:24:02] wicked Heathen City and preach a
[1:24:10] message
[1:24:12] now who can know the mind of
[1:24:17] God here you have Israel you know the
[1:24:21] Babylonian captivity all this was to
[1:24:23] come later on if I understand the
[1:24:25] timeline correctly I but Nineveh takes
[1:24:30] place before the Babylonian cap
[1:24:32] captivity if I've got it
[1:24:34] right but anyway you don't find it
[1:24:37] nowhere that's why I say who can know
[1:24:40] the mind of God some things God just
[1:24:43] don't tell His prophets he never told
[1:24:46] Moses and someday there's going to be in
[1:24:49] a ey he could
[1:24:50] have but we don't read it
[1:24:53] anywhere so it's
[1:24:56] silent but where God had a secret that
[1:25:00] he kept from even his own
[1:25:02] people
[1:25:04] because there was somebody down there
[1:25:06] was going to be people born and to me
[1:25:08] this is so staggering this is why this
[1:25:11] message is just opening up more and more
[1:25:14] and
[1:25:15] more in having the mind of Christ you
[1:25:17] you're seeing the way God thinks this is
[1:25:20] God's thinking on this play this message
[1:25:24] is God's thinking on
[1:25:28] display and when you have that
[1:25:30] Supernatural spirit of God in you then
[1:25:34] all this starts to Dove tail
[1:25:38] together and you can
[1:25:40] see God giving Mercy not just the
[1:25:44] nites but the
[1:25:46] jebusites they
[1:25:51] lied you know
[1:25:53] that they lied to
[1:25:59] Joshua now what what what what happened
[1:26:02] when people
[1:26:03] lie to God's
[1:26:06] people pretty serious consequences
[1:26:09] ain't and here these jeps
[1:26:12] sites they were found
[1:26:15] mercy and they become wood
[1:26:18] cutters and according to what some
[1:26:20] sources say the jebusites served the
[1:26:24] Lord for Generation after generation
[1:26:26] even when Israel itself God's people
[1:26:30] backslid the jebusites stood with
[1:26:37] Jehovah this Bible is a new
[1:26:40] book history is being Rewritten I have
[1:26:43] said this time and time again brother
[1:26:45] and sister we didn't really know what
[1:26:47] just the just being justified what was
[1:26:50] all about the Prophet came to tell us
[1:26:53] you didn't do it in the first place
[1:26:55] that's where you're
[1:26:56] at you say well I yeah but I actually
[1:26:59] did you may actually have thought of yes
[1:27:01] we did but in God's
[1:27:04] mind it's
[1:27:06] gone it is absolutely gone there's no
[1:27:10] fossil bed there's not going to be any
[1:27:12] archaological digs that's going to be
[1:27:14] able to dig up your past your past could
[1:27:18] be in every
[1:27:19] Courthouse across the United States
[1:27:22] that's true books even written about you
[1:27:25] the henus person that you were like lady
[1:27:28] mcabe yeah but as far as God's
[1:27:31] dictionary God's encyclopedia God's
[1:27:33] history book it's not even
[1:27:37] there if God be for you who can be
[1:27:40] against
[1:27:51] you
[1:27:53] they find these
[1:27:55] things over in
[1:27:58] Siberia massive amounts
[1:28:01] of Buffalo I believe it
[1:28:04] was or
[1:28:06] mastadons herds of
[1:28:11] them in these Mass
[1:28:14] Graves and it looks like some of them
[1:28:17] display such like some gigantic Force
[1:28:22] literally picked these huge creatures
[1:28:27] and threw them up against a rock
[1:28:29] wall with injuries to their
[1:28:32] legs that could not have happened unless
[1:28:35] there had been some sort of catastrophic
[1:28:42] disaster scientists don't know what that
[1:28:45] is they find these things Frozen in the
[1:28:50] ice they're com constantly finding
[1:28:53] things the Chinese have an underground
[1:28:56] traffic of these ivories that taken from
[1:28:59] these mastadons where they're washing
[1:29:01] out of the seashores on the Arctic
[1:29:05] Ocean falling out of the
[1:29:07] banks they make that stuff and send it
[1:29:10] down to China where they make sculptures
[1:29:11] out of it a mute
[1:29:15] testimony but I'll tell you what as sins
[1:29:17] of a
[1:29:18] Believer your neighbor he but I say this
[1:29:22] you made restitution some of you had to
[1:29:24] come out and confess some of the
[1:29:25] awfulest things in your life and in my
[1:29:28] life and I tell you what if I'd pass
[1:29:31] this microphone around right now who
[1:29:33] want to talk about their past
[1:29:36] life I don't want to even
[1:29:39] resurrected but you know Paul did but he
[1:29:41] did for an
[1:29:43] example First
[1:29:45] Corinthians why why do we read about why
[1:29:49] do we read about Samson and his mistakes
[1:29:52] why do we read about this one and that
[1:29:55] one and in fact Joseph told a
[1:29:58] lie no such thing as a white lie he told
[1:30:01] a
[1:30:02] lie all of sin and come short of the
[1:30:05] glory of God he want just a goody good
[1:30:08] boy he needed Christ like you and I
[1:30:13] don't never forget that despite the fact
[1:30:16] that Joseph stood for his God stood for
[1:30:19] his faith he could have done it on his
[1:30:22] own he was still the grace of God but
[1:30:24] when it turned around he still told a
[1:30:27] lie saying my
[1:30:29] people are herdsmen and not Shepherds
[1:30:32] because Shepherds were an Abomination to
[1:30:34] the
[1:30:37] Egyptians so we're all all are
[1:30:41] contaminated but here's the
[1:30:47] thing many of them was God now well
[1:30:50] pleased now those people they got a book
[1:30:53] it was open and then it
[1:30:55] shut and Jesus said your sin
[1:30:59] remains oh
[1:31:01] God think of it brother Terry you have
[1:31:05] to preach a funeral for somebody and you
[1:31:07] know they died in their
[1:31:10] sin and people are looking for some sort
[1:31:13] of Speck
[1:31:14] of maybe maybe
[1:31:20] maybe maybe they made it maybe they had
[1:31:23] a death
[1:31:24] bed oh
[1:31:27] my and no that that person went beyond
[1:31:29] the veil I've wondered about that
[1:31:32] brother Bram said plainly in the message
[1:31:34] one place he said the blood cannot
[1:31:37] go beyond the veil of death it cannot
[1:31:43] the blood will not reach into the
[1:31:46] regions of the
[1:31:48] Damned because the Redemption of the
[1:31:50] blood is on only here the only saving
[1:31:54] through the blood is to be done here in
[1:31:56] this Dimension he said you go he said a
[1:31:59] lost person goes beyond the
[1:32:03] reach of the
[1:32:06] blood I don't know about you but sister
[1:32:10] it makes me feel for
[1:32:12] people dying like
[1:32:15] flies oh I wish I could die oh I want Dr
[1:32:18] kavor and to put something in my arm the
[1:32:21] moment their heart stops and they go
[1:32:23] into the other dimension without God
[1:32:25] they're looking for somebody to bring
[1:32:27] them back but there ain't nobody to
[1:32:30] bring them
[1:32:31] back they realize they're
[1:32:33] lost the suffering in that
[1:32:36] body would be like a picnic compared to
[1:32:40] the torment that they're in right
[1:32:42] now what the devil's tricks brother
[1:32:45] Terry look how the devil plays with the
[1:32:48] minds of people their souls are lost
[1:32:52] they're seriously
[1:32:54] lost and and he dups them into believe
[1:32:56] in that kind of
[1:32:58] garbage he makes fools of his own
[1:33:01] children nothing good about the
[1:33:07] devil
[1:33:09] Paul he says these things were for our
[1:33:13] examples to the intent we should not
[1:33:15] lust after evil things as they also
[1:33:18] lusted neither be ye
[1:33:20] idolators neither let us commit
[1:33:23] fornication neither let us tempt
[1:33:26] Christ neither murmur ye as some of them
[1:33:29] also murmaid you see there's something
[1:33:32] about some Believers and we all need
[1:33:36] this let me tell you something we all
[1:33:38] need this this ain't just for some
[1:33:41] people it's just ain't for the
[1:33:42] Corinthian Church this is for everybody
[1:33:45] because there's some of us we stroll in
[1:33:47] our
[1:33:48] flesh some of us have real battles
[1:33:52] but there will come a time when you'll
[1:33:54] overcome that flesh that flesh is not
[1:33:56] going to dictate to you but you're going
[1:33:58] to believe in your heart that Christ has
[1:34:00] raised him from the dead why the promise
[1:34:02] comes down through that mystical channel
[1:34:04] of your soul and you see it you walk out
[1:34:07] of these do a changed person and you
[1:34:09] start living a different life the old
[1:34:12] Amos cs's dead the new man amen is
[1:34:17] moving
[1:34:20] on again he says in 1 Corinthians 10:11
[1:34:24] all these things happen un them for
[1:34:26] examples they're written for our
[1:34:30] admonition upon whom the ends of the
[1:34:32] world are
[1:34:34] come they are written for our
[1:34:38] admonition we have to have record of
[1:34:40] these things they're examples to us as
[1:34:45] Believers
[1:34:47] now the Old Testament recorded
[1:34:51] everything
[1:34:53] it told it all didn't
[1:34:56] spare it it really tells it
[1:34:59] all now the New
[1:35:01] Testament there was a very big change
[1:35:04] and let
[1:35:05] me read to you if I can find
[1:35:09] it what Paul says
[1:35:12] here in
[1:35:14] the to the
[1:35:17] Corinthians 1 Corinthians 6 and9 he says
[1:35:21] now remember
[1:35:23] this know you not that the
[1:35:26] unrighteous that's the ones that ain't
[1:35:28] Blood Washed blood cleansed not even
[1:35:30] believing on the
[1:35:32] blood and not foolish virgins they're
[1:35:35] unbelievers know ye not that the
[1:35:37] unrighteous shall not inherit the
[1:35:39] kingdom of
[1:35:40] God not going to make it not going to
[1:35:43] make it the blood's the only
[1:35:50] way he said
[1:35:52] says be not deceived neither fornicators
[1:35:56] nor idolators nor adulterers nor a
[1:35:58] feminite
[1:36:00] boy Paul is getting very
[1:36:03] graphic you got to remember this
[1:36:05] Corinthian Church was really steeped in
[1:36:08] carnality of the worst flowest
[1:36:11] sorts but you know God had children in
[1:36:14] there God had predestined elected seat
[1:36:17] you know and who are we to say you know
[1:36:19] oh well I wasn't like that sh shame on
[1:36:21] you you were polluted too all of us were
[1:36:25] contaminated all of us were filthy and
[1:36:31] unrighteous nor thieves nor Covetous nor
[1:36:33] drunkers nor revilers nor
[1:36:35] extortioners shall inherit the kingdom
[1:36:38] of God and then Paul makes this
[1:36:41] statement now notice what he says and
[1:36:44] such were
[1:36:47] some of
[1:36:49] you oh you get to to feeling pretty good
[1:36:52] about
[1:36:53] yourself maybe God has just left us a
[1:36:55] little bit of memory here not to dog us
[1:37:00] but to always
[1:37:01] realize David said I look back at the
[1:37:04] pit that he'd come out of he brought me
[1:37:07] out of the myy clay so God leaves a
[1:37:11] little bit of memory there but he says
[1:37:12] this of such were some of you but oh
[1:37:17] Hallelujah ye are washed ye are
[1:37:21] Sanctified you are justified in the name
[1:37:24] of the Lord
[1:37:26] Jesus by the spirit of our
[1:37:33] God Paul mentions
[1:37:35] it examples but he put no name to it no
[1:37:41] doubt Paul with a mind like you and I
[1:37:46] filled with the Holy Ghost he's up for
[1:37:49] preaching and here sitting in the second
[1:37:52] row is a
[1:37:54] man that lived with his
[1:37:57] stepmother over here is a
[1:38:01] former
[1:38:03] lesbian
[1:38:05] effeminate I don't even like to go into
[1:38:07] the details on
[1:38:11] that but Paul even knows
[1:38:15] this because he's prayed for some of
[1:38:17] these people to be delivered and had
[1:38:19] demons cast out but Paul no longer is
[1:38:23] looking now Paul knows this with his
[1:38:25] carnal mind and so do you some of you
[1:38:28] you know what your past was but Paul
[1:38:31] sees a daughter of God he sees a pure
[1:38:35] righteous sinless
[1:38:37] spotless blood-washed
[1:38:39] Soul who no longer displays the
[1:38:42] characteristics of a street wh or
[1:38:46] perverted
[1:38:48] boy he sees a son of God
[1:38:52] washed the precious blood of Jesus
[1:38:55] Christ and if Paul has the mind of God
[1:38:59] yeah he's he maybe he has to fight that
[1:39:01] thing he says oh I don't know uh did I
[1:39:04] have my shots because I got to sit down
[1:39:06] with some of these people and uh they
[1:39:08] might double dip you know
[1:39:11] and um they might have something that
[1:39:13] they picked up you know they can't get
[1:39:14] rid of and
[1:39:17] uh let me tell you something
[1:39:20] Paul believed in the power of God I
[1:39:22] don't think Paul was stupid I don't
[1:39:24] think he threw caution to the wind but
[1:39:27] Paul had the ability with the blood of
[1:39:29] Jesus Christ on his own soul knowing he
[1:39:32] was in a religious system he was a
[1:39:34] sinner he was a murderer a killer of
[1:39:39] Believers and he could look at these
[1:39:42] Gentiles at the Jews and say what kind
[1:39:45] of scumball are you associating
[1:39:49] with he could turn around and say just
[1:39:52] what Peter what God told Peter what God
[1:39:55] has cleansed called not
[1:39:57] unclean that's what Peter at the house
[1:40:00] of
[1:40:01] Cornelius seen all kinds
[1:40:05] of unclean things in a
[1:40:10] sheet oh no no no lord I can't eat that
[1:40:16] zebra I can't eat that hog there I can't
[1:40:19] I can't that's unclean that's
[1:40:22] unclean and God says what God has
[1:40:25] cleansed called not
[1:40:29] unclean
[1:40:31] Hallelujah God looks through the blood
[1:40:34] and says to the devil what God what I
[1:40:38] have cleansed through my blood go not
[1:40:42] unclean if God is for you like that why
[1:40:45] are you beating up on
[1:40:47] yourself when it don't even exist in the
[1:40:50] mind of of God that's not a figment of
[1:40:53] my imagination that's the truth before
[1:40:56] God you got to be able to get up on that
[1:40:59] stage yourself and say
[1:41:03] that it's either the truth or it ain't
[1:41:05] the truth that we got to start live it
[1:41:07] like it's a
[1:41:15] truth there is therefore now no
[1:41:18] condemnation to Sister Martha
[1:41:21] because she walks after the spirit and
[1:41:23] not after the Flesh and if God be for
[1:41:26] you then who can be against
[1:41:30] you you met the requirements you applied
[1:41:33] the token the token is on the door of
[1:41:37] your heart his Spirit lives in
[1:41:41] you that's the greatest mystery to
[1:41:47] me so
[1:41:49] why
[1:41:52] I wonder
[1:41:54] sometimes
[1:41:57] well if you're not
[1:41:59] certain make sure you got a word
[1:42:02] birth holy ghost in
[1:42:04] fire it burns out and kills that old man
[1:42:08] brother R said an invisible Union I'm
[1:42:10] going to close brother R said an
[1:42:12] invisible Union you just don't divorce
[1:42:15] this thing because in Romans chapter 7
[1:42:19] you read
[1:42:21] that she's dead while she lives and if
[1:42:23] her first husband is still
[1:42:27] alive that first husband has to
[1:42:30] die there's only one thing that can do
[1:42:33] and that's the Holy Ghost and Fire when
[1:42:36] not life comes in the literal fire of
[1:42:38] God comes into your soul and burns out
[1:42:41] that old man and resurrects that little
[1:42:44] Jean
[1:42:49] seed
[1:42:51] there is no association
[1:42:55] whatsoever or identification with the
[1:42:57] world after that I don't I don't care
[1:43:01] who you tell me I don't we've heard so
[1:43:04] much of this
[1:43:05] message enough to show us that youve got
[1:43:09] people out here that'll work under the
[1:43:11] anointing preach under the anointing
[1:43:13] prophesy under the anoint and still be
[1:43:15] devils in their
[1:43:19] heart
[1:43:24] Prophet come along and said
[1:43:26] balum absolutely had a gift from God to
[1:43:30] prophesy you know who you know what his
[1:43:32] dictation was he had a
[1:43:35] gift but he hadn't given his heart to
[1:43:38] God he gave his tongue to God but he
[1:43:42] didn't give his heart to God his heart
[1:43:44] was after filthy
[1:43:49] lucer
[1:43:53] you would think after a donkey talks to
[1:43:55] you you
[1:44:01] listen that was
[1:44:03] Mercy you stop and think about
[1:44:06] that if donkey a horse starts talking to
[1:44:09] you is in a language he could understand
[1:44:13] too one all garble up like a bunch of
[1:44:16] tongues unknown
[1:44:18] tongues it was a tongue he
[1:44:21] stood coming from a
[1:44:23] donkey God speaking through a donkey to
[1:44:26] get balam's attention amen he buddy
[1:44:29] you're on the wrong road amen see that
[1:44:32] donkey seen the angel of the Lord
[1:44:33] standing there with a drawing sword
[1:44:35] that's right said I know one thing I
[1:44:37] ain't sure ain't going to try to bypass
[1:44:40] him he started beating you see the
[1:44:43] character bam started beating that
[1:44:46] donkey that donkey seen the Ang watch
[1:44:49] out watch watch out even sometimes we
[1:44:51] can get in the flesh we can start
[1:44:54] beating the donkey cuz the donkey ain't
[1:44:56] doing what we want the Donkey to do is
[1:44:59] Achieve our
[1:45:00] goals there may be something standing
[1:45:03] there that God has showed the donkey
[1:45:06] that if he was humble enough you'd say
[1:45:08] maybe I better go and repay pray about
[1:45:10] this thing
[1:45:14] again that donkey mashed his foot
[1:45:18] against the wall because he said I'm not
[1:45:20] I'm not going by that guy I'm not going
[1:45:22] by that angel with that drawing sword no
[1:45:25] way Jose I'm stay I'm going the other
[1:45:31] way takes a donkey sometimes to talk to
[1:45:35] people God old G sometimes sometimes we
[1:45:38] get in a shape we get in a spot where we
[1:45:42] become
[1:45:44] bullheaded we become so so determined
[1:45:47] and so I'm going to go through with this
[1:45:50] thing no no matter
[1:45:53] what you God loves us whom the Lord
[1:45:55] loveth he also chased us Bo I I'm so
[1:45:59] glad I got chasing from the
[1:46:01] Lord that that only testifies to who I
[1:46:04] am
[1:46:07] that's when I'm
[1:46:09] saying what

[1:47:28] and my records cleared
[1:47:30] today for he washed my sins away you
[1:47:34] know some time ago I seen a a YouTube
[1:47:37] video of uh some prison
[1:47:40] somewhere and these were prisoners you
[1:47:42] know they look like older
[1:47:44] men and
[1:47:46] uh
[1:47:49] anyway they're probably in there for
[1:47:53] life I mean they looked all right they
[1:47:55] was but you know there was something
[1:47:56] about
[1:47:58] them they had they were singing in the
[1:48:01] chapel in the prison Chapel they were
[1:48:03] clapping their hands and worshiping the
[1:48:07] Lord singing like I think it was I'm not
[1:48:10] sure what it was Power in the Blood or
[1:48:12] something like
[1:48:13] that they look like free men to
[1:48:16] me no I say they look like free men they
[1:48:20] acted like free
[1:48:22] men you know
[1:48:25] why I don't know what level of
[1:48:27] spirituality they're
[1:48:28] at you know what there's some people
[1:48:32] that have sat in this church that are in
[1:48:36] Chains and those people were more free
[1:48:38] behind several layers of security
[1:48:41] electronic security and
[1:48:44] cameras those men were more free than
[1:48:47] some of us sometimes that comes into a
[1:48:49] church and here's a

[1:49:27] this that little old girl had she not
[1:49:30] gone she could have walked right on by
[1:49:32] that dance

[1:51:34] thing I believe with all my heart the
[1:51:37] next time she's walking down that street
[1:51:39] House of hell you have no pull on me
[1:51:44] anymore and I want you to know that's
[1:51:47] the kind of life you and I can live
[1:51:50] God wants us to live like that house of
[1:51:53] hell you have no hold on
[1:51:57] me I'm
[1:51:59] free I'm free I don't want no ball and

[1:52:06] [Applause]
[1:52:08] go I used to live like that
[1:52:11] [Music]
[1:52:14] spiritually it's
[1:52:16] miserable you feel miserable because the
[1:52:20] prophet even said you just get enough a
[1:52:24] God to make yourself
[1:52:27] miserable I remember when the Revelation
[1:52:30] first struck my heart and knew that this
[1:52:32] was a truth but I didn't let God have
[1:52:34] all of
[1:52:35] me I still was walking around married to
[1:52:39] the old man I didn't have a word
[1:52:41] bir still had a knowledge and reel I
[1:52:44] knew it was a truth and it was pulling
[1:52:46] on
[1:52:47] me but it's until I got that word birth
[1:52:52] those
[1:52:53] Spirits want me to do the things of the
[1:52:56] world ungodly things that Spirit left me
[1:53:01] when he got cast
[1:53:05] out Jesus come and sat on the throne of
[1:53:07] my
[1:53:08] [Music]
[1:53:12] heart all things are passed away
[1:53:16] remember that doesn't start and this is
[1:53:20] kind of like a big broad statement now
[1:53:23] that doesn't start when you walk through
[1:53:27] the gates of that City it starts
[1:53:31] now and the former thing shall not come
[1:53:35] into mind you say but I still got this
[1:53:39] so do I but I'm making new memories and
[1:53:42] packing them in there left and right so
[1:53:44] that all those older memories are
[1:53:46] getting packed so tight and they they're
[1:53:49] only found in my
[1:53:51] mind but I don't dig them up I don't go
[1:53:55] over to work say oh yeah I used to do
[1:53:57] this I hear some carnal Christians
[1:54:00] saying almost like they're bragging you
[1:54:02] know what they're doing they're
[1:54:04] resurrecting some of them just ain't had
[1:54:06] a word
[1:54:07] birth they still ain't dead
[1:54:09] [Music]
[1:54:12] yet at that
[1:54:14] life you make new memories that's why
[1:54:17] brother brand said he had a new book it
[1:54:21] was he had William brandom but you know
[1:54:23] what it was really the Lamb's
[1:54:26] Book his name was in that book so in
[1:54:31] other words it's no longer William
[1:54:32] Braham but it's Mrs Jesus Christ William
[1:54:36] Brown it's Mrs Jesus Christ Terry and
[1:54:38] Alice horn it's Mrs Jesus Christ brother
[1:54:42] so and so brother so and so sister so
[1:54:45] and so it's the new book there is only
[1:54:48] one new book that's the book of
[1:54:51] redemption but you've
[1:54:53] got a little verse in
[1:54:57] there and it's called the book of
[1:55:01] Acts of Terry
[1:55:03] Horn and you know
[1:55:05] what Greater Works than these shall you
[1:55:09] do because I go to my father you're
[1:55:12] doing the Greater Works so Jesus Christ
[1:55:16] is's actually able to do
[1:55:18] more through our life than what he could
[1:55:23] when he was here on
[1:55:24] Earth now that's just not the
[1:55:27] prophet that's also you and
[1:55:30] I he can do more through a multi-member
[1:55:34] body you love the Lord tonight thank you
[1:55:37] for your attention I know Sunday nights
[1:55:39] sometimes we are tired and and so forth
[1:55:42] and uh I just thank you for praying for
[1:55:45] me and pray for
[1:55:46] me in the upcoming whatever
[1:55:50] uh I just feel like I don't know I feel
[1:55:52] like something good is about to
[1:55:54] [Music]
[1:55:56] happen it's always good I told somebody
[1:55:59] here not long ago it's always
[1:56:02] good you know a squeeze comes whatever
[1:56:05] it's it's it's still good cuz God's
[1:56:08] going to prove
[1:56:09] himself you've got the
[1:56:11] authority to speak a world into
[1:56:14] existence now it's CED by a law and
[1:56:17] that's where now don't don't cut
[1:56:20] yourself too short by saying that that's
[1:56:24] like a lot of people will quote that
[1:56:25] quote they'll
[1:56:27] say they'll say well the bride just keep
[1:56:31] still if if she doesn't feel the
[1:56:33] leadership of the Lord she'll just keep
[1:56:35] still you keep it still too long why you
[1:56:37] doing sitting at thy red light done turn
[1:56:40] green a long time
[1:56:41] [Music]
[1:56:44] ago that's
[1:56:46] legalism shaking that off
[1:56:50] fear fear you're going to get out of
[1:56:54] order I think somebody said from this
[1:56:56] Pulpit here in one during during the
[1:56:58] meetings or whatever about time some of
[1:57:01] us would get out of
[1:57:02] order so we need to be corrected I'm not
[1:57:05] saying to get out of order but you know
[1:57:07] what I'm talking about that's why the
[1:57:09] prophet said I'd have a little bit of
[1:57:11] wildfire no fire at
[1:57:13] all God help me I don't want to become
[1:57:17] an old starchy Lutheran Methodist
[1:57:21] Presbyterian no way Jose no way Jose am
[1:57:24] I going to go back to that kind of junk
[1:57:27] trash lifeless
[1:57:30] morbid nah nah
[1:57:34] nah nope sorry I don't mean to be rude
[1:57:38] or
[1:57:39] crude but I'm going to tell you one
[1:57:41] thing it's about time we get the mind of
[1:57:44] God you really see who you
[1:57:48] are the the think about it is as a
[1:57:51] brother or sister you might be given the

[1:58:14] that when their cousins making fun of
[1:58:15] her and she's saving up her pennies to
[1:58:18] buy that wedding dress
[1:58:20] she didn't worry about what they were
[1:58:21] going to say to her she didn't worry
[1:58:24] about all that other nonsense that's on
[1:58:25] the internet they got going on right now

[1:58:30] the
[1:58:31] other didn't pay no attention to
[1:58:35] it you come too late to tell me I'll
