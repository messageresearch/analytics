[14:42] Satan's
[14:45] roaring lion. He's roaming to and fro.
[14:50] He's seeking whom he may devour. The
[14:55] Bible tells us so.
[14:59] Now many souls have been his prey to
[15:04] fall in some weak.
[15:07] Oh, but God has promised us today. His
[15:12] overcoming
[15:14] power. Oh yes, greater is he that is in
[15:19] me. Oh, greater is he that is in me.
[15:25] Greater is he that is in me than he that
[15:30] is in the world.
[15:33] Now on the day of Pentecost,
[15:37] a rushing mighty wind
[15:41] it blew into the upper room and baptized
[15:47] all of them.
[15:50] Now with a power greater than oh any
[15:55] earthly foe.
[15:58] Yes, I'm so glad I've got it, too. I'm

[16:21] the world. Oh yes, greater is he that is
[16:26] in me.
[16:28] Greater is he that is in me.
[16:32] Oh, greater is he that is in me than he
[16:36] that is in the world. Yes. Now on the
[16:41] day of Pentecost, oh a rushing mighty
[16:46] wind,
[16:48] it blew into the upper room and baptized
[16:54] all of them.
[16:56] Now with a power greater than, oh any
[17:02] earthly foe.
[17:04] Oh, I'm so glad I've got it, too. I'm
[17:09] going to let the whole world know. Yes.
[17:13] That greater is he that is in me.
[17:17] Greater is he that is in me. Oh, greater
[17:22] is he that is in me than he that is in
[17:27] the world. Oh yes, greater is he that is
[17:32] in me.
[17:34] Greater is he that is in me.
[17:38] Oh, greater is he that is in me.
[17:42] He that is in the world.

[18:11] Oh, declaring the word of the Lord.

[18:21] Moses righteousness being restored.
[18:27] And though these are days of great
[18:30] trials, oh famine and darkness and sore,
[18:38] still we are the voice in the desert,
[18:42] crying, prepare ye the way of the Lord.
[18:47] Behold, he comes. Oh, riding on the
[18:51] clouds, shining like the sun. Oh, at the

[19:14] Oh, those dry bones becoming as flesh.
[19:19] Yes. And these are the days of your
[19:23] servant David rebuilding a temple of
[19:28] praise.
[19:31] These are the days of the harvest. Oh,
[19:36] the fields are as wide in the world.
[19:41] And we are your laborers in your venure,
[19:47] declaring the word of the Lord. Oh,
[19:50] behold, he comes. Oh, riding on the
[19:55] clouds, shining like the sun. Oh, at the

[21:24] the trumpets call, so lift your voice.
[21:29] It's the year of Jubilee
[21:31] and out of Zion's heel salvation

[21:40] praise tonight?
[21:43] Amen.

[26:14] has an unspoken request but lift your

[26:18] Maybe we could ask Judah if he would

[26:28] special way tonight. Amen.

[26:44] Lord, and just asking your presence,
[26:47] Father. We ask that you just come down

[27:14] calls me his own
[27:19] and he'll never
[27:22] leave me
[27:25] no matter where
[27:28] I go.
[27:32] And he knows my name.
[27:36] [Music]
[27:39] And he knows my every thought.
[27:45] And he sees
[27:47] each tear that falls. And he hears me
[27:52] when I call. You can be seated as mom
[27:55] gets ready to come. Oh, he knows my
[28:00] name.
[28:01] [Music]
[28:04] And he knows my every thought.
[28:10] And he sees each tear that falls.
[28:15] And he hears me when I call.
[28:21] Yes, he hears me when
[28:25] I call.
[28:28] [Music]
[28:38] You know, I know when the Lord does
[28:39] something for us like healing in your
[28:42] body, sometimes it's a miracle and
[28:44] instantaneous and sometimes
[28:47] he lets it linger,
[28:49] but it it's healing. When I say linger,
[28:52] I mean that sometimes it's healing and
[28:53] it takes its time, but it's still the
[28:56] promise. And when you accept that
[28:58] promise, you know it has to happen. And
[29:00] I was Sunday morning, I was playing a
[29:03] message and going back and forth while
[29:05] we were getting ready. But just as I
[29:08] happened to walk into the laundry room,
[29:10] I heard brother Brandham say to a lady,
[29:14] "Uh, sister, you with stomach trouble,
[29:16] it's over now." And to me, just little
[29:19] things like that's just the
[29:20] confirmation, you know, just continuous
[29:22] confirmation that it might not be right
[29:24] this second, but it's got to happen.
[29:26] So, I'm thankful we can rest in that.
[29:32] &gt;&gt; There are two roads
[29:36] you may take,
[29:39] one by sight
[29:43] and one by faith.
[29:47] Take the word of God
[29:50] over what you see.
[29:53] What you believe
[29:57] is what will be.
[29:59] [Music]
[30:00] So set your wings
[30:04] to the winds of faith.
[30:08] You can fly
[30:11] in a higher place.
[30:15] Do not struggle.
[30:19] It's by grace.
[30:22] Set your ways
[30:25] to the winds of faith.
[30:29] What's your need?
[30:32] What's your cry?
[30:36] What's your mountain
[30:38] that's much too high?
[30:42] Speak the word of God
[30:45] and by and by
[30:48] [Music]
[30:49] it will move
[30:52] or you will fly.
[30:55] Just send your wings
[30:59] to the winds of faith.
[31:03] You can fly
[31:06] in a higher place.
[31:09] Do not struggle.
[31:12] It's by his grace.
[31:16] Set your wings
[31:19] to the winds of faith.
[31:22] Just watch the eagle
[31:26] in the sky.
[31:29] He does not struggle.
[31:32] He does not strive
[31:36] for the power
[31:39] that makes him rise.
[31:43] It's already
[31:46] in the skies.
[31:49] Just add your wings
[31:52] to the winds of faith.
[31:56] You can fly
[31:59] in the higher place.
[32:02] Do not struggle
[32:05] for it's by his grace.
[32:09] Set your wings
[32:12] to the winds of faith.
[32:15] Just watch that eagle
[32:18] [Music]
[32:19] in the sky.
[32:22] He does not struggle.
[32:25] He does not strive
[32:29] for the power
[32:31] that makes him rise.
[32:35] It's already
[32:38] in the sky.
[32:41] Just set your wings
[32:45] to those winds of faith.
[32:48] were made to fly
[32:51] in that higher place.
[32:55] Do not struggle
[32:58] for it's by his grace.
[33:01] Set your wings
[33:04] to the winds of faith.
[33:07] Just set your wings
[33:11] to the winds of faith.
[33:14] We were made
[33:17] for that higher place.
[33:21] Do not struggle.
[33:24] It's by his grace.
[33:27] Set your wings
[33:30] to the winds of faith.
[33:32] [Music]
[33:34] Do not struggle,
[33:37] for it's by his grace.
[33:40] Set your wings
[33:43] to the winds of faith.
[33:46] Just set your wings
[33:50] to the winds of faith.
[33:55] [Music]
[34:03] Amen. Are you setting your wings to the
[34:05] winds of faith tonight? Amen. And can we
[34:08] just stand to our feet as we invite our
[34:11] pastor to come?
[34:16] I bless your name.
[34:18] [Music]
[34:21] I bless your name.
[34:28] I give you honor,
[34:34] Lord. I give you praise.
[34:41] You are the light,
[34:46] oh the truth, the way.
[34:53] Oh, I bless your name,
[34:59] Lord. I bless your name. Sing it now.
[35:05] Oh, I bless your name.
[35:12] I bless your name.
[35:19] I give you honor,
[35:24] Lord. I give you praise.
[35:31] You are the life.
[35:36] Hold the truth away.
[35:43] Oh, I bless your name,
[35:47] [Applause]
[35:49] Lord. I bless your name.
[35:56] Oh, in prisoners chains.
[36:00] [Music]
[36:02] Oh, with bleeding
[36:05] stripes.
[36:09] Oh, Paul and Silas.
[36:14] Oh, they prayed that night.
[36:20] Oh, and in their pain,
[36:26] oh, they began to see,
[36:33] their chains were loose.
[36:39] Oh, when they were free,
[36:45] oh, I bless your name.
[36:51] [Music]
[37:01] Honor,
[37:04] I give you praise.
[37:08] [Music]
[37:10] You are the life,
[37:15] [Music]
[37:16] the truth, the way.
[37:21] [Music]
[37:22] I bless your name.
[37:29] I bless your name.
[37:34] [Music]
[37:35] Aren't you glad that you have the
[37:36] ability to praise him?
[37:39] Amen. That you have a voice, you have a
[37:43] mouth, you have the ability to honor him
[37:47] with your words, with your hands,
[37:50] able to go to church and magnify the
[37:53] Lord, able to hear the word of God.
[37:58] Amen. We have a lot to thank the Lord
[38:01] for, to be able to bless him. Amen. Be
[38:05] able to bless him. think of many people
[38:08] that don't have the hands to raise and
[38:12] honor to the Lord and not able to have
[38:15] the voice and that oh God let me give
[38:19] everything that I have to you to bless
[38:21] you
[38:22] &gt;&gt; bless your holy name. Amen. The
[38:25] musicians can be dismissed. Um it's good
[38:29] to have everyone back uh that was gone
[38:32] over the weekend and um um I know
[38:36] there's sickness that's been going
[38:38] around uh but um we are overcoming that
[38:44] and so we thank the Lord for that.
[38:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:48] &gt;&gt; Um we want to uh keep Sister Kim in our
[38:52] prayer.
[38:54] Uh she's uh having some real trouble and
[39:00] um the uh um
[39:05] just her stomach feels full.
[39:08] Um
[39:09] but she's uh not eating. Can't can't eat
[39:13] much and um dealing with nausea and just
[39:16] not feeling good. And so they've wanted
[39:19] her to come back in and uh have a
[39:23] another CT scan in the morning. And so
[39:27] she'll be having that in Palasi. So just
[39:30] asking for our prayer that um God will
[39:35] just move on her behalf. And I believe
[39:38] he's going to I believe he is. And um it
[39:43] might not look like it, but he is.
[39:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. And I'm I'm just believing that.
[39:50] And uh we are a people of faith.
[39:52] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[39:53] &gt;&gt; And um and so we um you know there's one
[39:57] thing to have influence. I was listening
[40:00] to brother Brandham the other day on
[40:02] influence and talked about how you know
[40:05] you can have influence with people
[40:08] and uh he said but the question is what
[40:11] is your influence with God?
[40:14] And I think if there's a people that has
[40:16] influence with God, that's the bride of
[40:18] Jesus Christ.
[40:20] &gt;&gt; And um I believe that when a a saint
[40:23] goes to praying, Amen. that everything
[40:27] just hushes up, Amen. and God begins to
[40:31] hear. And I believe the angels of God
[40:34] are sent on a commission, amen, to
[40:37] answer the prayers. Amen. Do you believe
[40:40] that? If you don't believe that, there
[40:43] is no use of praying.
[40:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. But the Bible says that whatever
[40:48] you ask when you pray, you shall have.
[40:51] &gt;&gt; And so, um, I I just believe that. And
[40:55] so, we don't need to, um, uh, keep our
[40:58] head down
[41:00] &gt;&gt; and, uh, got to keep our chin up, as my
[41:03] friend used to say, the third one that
[41:05] is, and, uh, so we'll keep all three
[41:09] chins up. and uh
[41:12] uh just know that God's on the scene.
[41:14] Amen. Praise the Lord. Well, how many
[41:17] loves the Lord?
[41:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:21] Um so, let's go to praying in prayer
[41:25] before we go into the word. And uh let's
[41:29] just ask God to be with us tonight and
[41:32] also be with sister Kim. Father,
[41:36] oh gracious God,
[41:39] we approach you not as beggars but as
[41:43] your children
[41:46] that you forneew before the foundation
[41:48] of the world and through all of time
[41:53] you have been working for to this day
[41:58] Lord you have sent redeemer you've come
[42:02] in flesh to redeem redeem us that you
[42:05] might live in us. And Father, that as
[42:10] you would utter words in a body of a man
[42:14] uh your flesh 2,000 years ago, Father,
[42:18] you would utter words within our lips
[42:21] and use our mouth, Lord. And as we pray,
[42:26] we know, Lord, that that our prayers are
[42:30] answered. And father, we're just asking
[42:33] that you would just touch Sister Kim.
[42:36] Lord, I know that the devil is throwing
[42:39] everything he can at her. But Lord, we
[42:43] know that you are our healer. And her
[42:46] faith is in contact, Lord. It's intact.
[42:49] And Satan's not able to uh uh push her
[42:54] and toss her around.
[42:57] But Father, she's looking to you. and we
[43:00] as your children are looking to you and
[43:02] we're just believing for a miracle to
[43:05] take place. Father, I just ask that you
[43:08] would be with her as she'd go tomorrow,
[43:11] Lord, to have that uh scan done. And may
[43:14] there be a great testimony come from it,
[43:17] Father. We just uh uh thank you ahead of
[43:21] time for answering the prayer, Lord, and
[43:24] pray that you would just be with us
[43:26] tonight and uh just anoint, Lord, and
[43:31] help me just to get myself out of the
[43:33] way and to surrender myself to you.
[43:37] Father, we need you now today more than
[43:40] we ever have. Anoint your people
[43:42] tonight, Father. We ask it in Jesus
[43:46] Christ's name. And the church says,
[43:50] "Amen." And amen. If you have your
[43:53] Bibles, we're going to turn to the book
[43:54] of Galatians, the 4th chapter, and then
[43:58] uh 2 Corinthians, the 3rd chapter.
[44:03] So, Galatians chapter 4.
[44:07] And just going to read uh a verse here
[44:11] in the 19th verse.
[44:17] Praise the Lord.
[44:21] And it says, "My little children of whom
[44:23] I travail in birth again
[44:27] until Christ be formed in you." Amen.
[44:33] Then 2 Corinthians the 3 chapter
[44:36] and the 18th verse.
[44:42] Praise the Lord.
[44:48] 2 Corinthians 3:18, "But we all with
[44:52] open face, beholding as in a glass the
[44:55] glory of the Lord, are changed into the
[44:59] same image from glory to glory, even as
[45:02] by the spirit of the Lord." Amen. You
[45:07] can have your seats this evening.
[45:13] Speaking of this uh reading here, I I
[45:16] think of of how wonderful
[45:19] it is to know that we are being changed
[45:25] and the change that is taking place. We
[45:29] are being formed into his image.
[45:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. And
[45:36] what it truly means as being we are in
[45:39] the age of the son of man revealing of
[45:42] the son of man and
[45:44] uh it's god becoming one with us as he
[45:49] and Christ was one
[45:52] &gt;&gt; and uh we are becoming the word by
[45:56] feeding on the word and I don't I don't
[46:00] have just uh I guess a thought I I pray
[46:05] though that won't get too scattered, but
[46:08] just thinking of um of the day that
[46:12] we're living in and how important uh uh
[46:16] the the message is and what it's doing
[46:20] for us.
[46:22] But this change that that Paul talked
[46:26] about um it's it's not something it's
[46:30] not meaning that you're going to be
[46:32] changed into something that you're not
[46:37] &gt;&gt; uh or that you weren't meant to be. Uh
[46:40] because first of all that's not the law
[46:43] of God. Um there in the book of Genesis,
[46:47] the Bible says that uh every seed was to
[46:51] bring forth of its kind.
[46:54] &gt;&gt; And so the change would happen because
[46:57] there was a seed there,
[46:59] &gt;&gt; right?
[47:00] &gt;&gt; And the the law of God was in the seed
[47:04] uh that the seed would be transformed.
[47:07] it would be changed
[47:09] &gt;&gt; and and so uh what whatever God ordained
[47:13] you to be that is what you are to be.
[47:18] &gt;&gt; It's like the oak tree cannot be changed
[47:21] into a pumpkin or the pumpkin be changed
[47:24] into a pecan tree or or what whatever
[47:29] seed but uh the the oak seed can be
[47:33] changed into an oak tree. It's it's a
[47:36] takes on a transformation
[47:38] and what started out just to be a little
[47:41] seed now uh it's it's it's changed and
[47:44] it's grown and matured and transformed
[47:48] into a a a tree. A pumpkin seed can be
[47:51] changed into a pumpkin. The power of
[47:55] change is in the seed.
[47:57] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? And and so um uh
[48:01] brother Brandham, he would say, "If you
[48:04] want to know what kind of a crop you're
[48:07] going to have or what this is growing up
[48:10] in the field, go back to find out what
[48:13] the seed is." See, the seed will produce
[48:17] just exactly what it is. It'll produce
[48:20] its kind. A corn will bring a corn, a
[48:24] cockab, a cockab, a wheat, a wheat,
[48:27] whatever it is, it will produce just
[48:30] what the seed was. Ain't that right?
[48:34] &gt;&gt; And so, uh, uh, this change is a a
[48:39] transformation that's that's taken
[48:42] place. And the prophet said, God does
[48:45] this transformation by the spirit of his
[48:49] word. Amen. The word of God and the
[48:53] spirit of God goes hand in hand. It's
[48:55] amazing how Satan works on both
[48:58] extremes. He will take the word away and
[49:01] get people in in just spirit. Amen. In
[49:04] in spirit. And then he'll take the
[49:07] spirit away and get people just in word.
[49:10] Just word.
[49:12] Amen. But Jesus said, "My word is spirit
[49:15] and they're alive." Yeah.
[49:17] &gt;&gt; And so you can't take the spirit away
[49:19] from the word or the word from the
[49:21] spirit. It's got to go hand in hand. And
[49:24] so the prophet said, "Now God plants his
[49:28] seed and throws his spirit on it and it
[49:32] brings forth the product.
[49:35] &gt;&gt; His holy spirit transforms the seed word
[49:39] to in to be vindicated of its kind."
[49:44] Ain't that right? Now God planted a word
[49:47] seed in every one of his children.
[49:51] &gt;&gt; If you are a child of God, a son or a
[49:54] daughter of God, the way you are that
[49:58] because of a word seed that God planted
[50:03] uh uh in in you and and so uh it the
[50:08] prophet would tell us it's a
[50:09] predestinated seed. So, it isn't a seed
[50:12] that was just uh uh evolved since you've
[50:16] been on the earth. It's it's it's a
[50:18] predestinated seed, meaning that he pred
[50:22] he predetermined
[50:24] what that seed would be uh before he
[50:28] planted it. In other words, he
[50:30] predetermined
[50:31] what you would be before you ever got
[50:34] here.
[50:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. And so now that seed, that
[50:38] predestinated seed is a son or a
[50:42] daughter of God. Amen. So there's no
[50:45] question uh you know uh kind of you know
[50:49] uh gambling on on well are you going to
[50:52] be or are you not going to be are you
[50:54] going to be? No. The seed determines
[50:56] what you are
[50:58] &gt;&gt; and and that was determined by God and
[51:02] and so it's a predestinated seed. It's
[51:05] an eternal seed because God's word is
[51:09] eternal.
[51:10] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? Any seed that that
[51:13] came forth. Amen. In the beginning, uh
[51:16] it had to come forth by the spoken word
[51:19] because there was nothing else to make a
[51:20] seed. So the prophet said the seed came
[51:23] by the spoken word. And so the seed that
[51:27] God placed in you is by the spoken word
[51:31] of God. Ain't that right? And and and so
[51:34] we we find that his word that he spoke
[51:38] about you uh is what he had in his mind
[51:43] about you.
[51:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. So his word started as a thought.
[51:48] Amen. Before it was a word, it was a
[51:50] thought. And and in God's thoughts, you
[51:54] were you you were in God's thinking.
[51:57] Every son and daughter of God uh uh was
[52:02] in God's thinking from before the
[52:05] foundation of the world. Ain't that
[52:07] right? And so then uh his his thought
[52:10] become expressed by uh uh his word. And
[52:14] so his word concerning you isn't
[52:18] anything different than his thoughts of
[52:21] you. what his thoughts are of you. His
[52:26] word is an expression of his thoughts.
[52:30] Ain't that right?
[52:31] &gt;&gt; So then there's nothing that can change
[52:34] what you were in his mind
[52:37] &gt;&gt; because it it's an eternal word, but it
[52:40] was an eternal thought. Amen. For that's
[52:42] what the prophet said. God's thoughts
[52:44] are eternal and they are real. Amen.
[52:49] more real than you are here this morning
[52:52] or this evening, more real than your
[52:55] first birth, more real than anything.
[52:58] God's thoughts are are real and they are
[53:01] eternal and that's where you started at
[53:04] in in his mind.
[53:06] &gt;&gt; So then your your first birth could not
[53:10] change that. There's nothing that can
[53:12] change you as to what you were in the
[53:17] mind of God in the thoughts of God. So
[53:20] your your first birth can't change it.
[53:22] Your sins can't change it. Uh uh your
[53:26] carnal ways couldn't change it. Your
[53:29] failures can't change. Uh anything. it.
[53:33] Nothing is powerful enough to change
[53:37] what God had of you in his mind.
[53:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. Romans 4 and6. I I like this uh
[53:45] chapter um here, but Paul would say,
[53:48] "Even as David also describeth the
[53:51] blessedness of the man unto whom God
[53:54] imputth righteousness without works,
[53:57] saying, "Blessed are they whose
[54:00] iniquities are forgiven, and whose sins
[54:04] are covered. Blessed is the man to whom
[54:08] the Lord will not impute sin."
[54:12] Now, now think of that. To whom the Lord
[54:15] will not impute sin,
[54:17] &gt;&gt; we're we're living in a day where God's
[54:19] wrath is is is coming upon this world.
[54:22] This world is shaking. It's trembling.
[54:25] It's it's in fear. It's in chaos because
[54:28] the wrath of God is fixing to be poured
[54:31] out. And yet we stand in this age and
[54:35] not one sin
[54:37] attributed it to us. Can you say amen?
[54:41] You see why why is that is because that
[54:44] God created a blood.
[54:47] &gt;&gt; He created uh what the Bible calls the
[54:50] sea of forgetfulness which is his blood.
[54:54] Amen. And and when your sin is there,
[54:57] when uh uh it's it's wiped away and and
[55:02] when you well, I think it was the
[55:04] prophet that said that when you receive
[55:06] the baptism of the Holy Ghost, your
[55:08] sexual blood is dismissed. Amen. And and
[55:11] and so I like what brother Brandham
[55:14] said, and I'm still talking about that
[55:16] eternal thought. Uh he says when you're
[55:20] washed in the blood of the lamb, not by
[55:22] makeelie, but really the blood of the
[55:25] lamb, God does not impute to you
[55:28] anything that's done because you're
[55:32] under the blood and he doesn't see it.
[55:35] &gt;&gt; See, there's a blood sacrifice. Now
[55:38] notice, the only thing he can see you in
[55:42] is the way he saw you before the
[55:45] foundation of the world when he put your
[55:48] name in the lamb's book of life.
[55:51] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? So that's why he
[55:53] provided the blood. So he would not see
[55:56] you in your sins. He would not SEE YOU
[55:59] AS A SINNER. He would not see you as
[56:01] defeated. Amen. But he would provide
[56:04] something that would cover you from your
[56:07] sins and separate you from your sins.
[56:10] That when he looks at you, he could look
[56:13] at you on earth in the midst of all sins
[56:17] and and and corruption in a body of
[56:21] failure, in a in in a body of of uh that
[56:25] is no good. with contaminated with
[56:28] subject to diseases and failures and
[56:31] mind battles and all of that. But he
[56:33] created a blood that when he saw you, he
[56:37] could LITERALLY SEE you the same way
[56:40] that he saw you in his mind. Can you say
[56:43] amen? Amen. See you, He didn't keep you
[56:46] in his mind. Amen. But now you are a
[56:49] manifestation here on earth. Amen. And
[56:52] he CAN STILL LOOK AT YOU in this body of
[56:55] corruption IN ALL YOUR SCARS OF YOUR
[56:58] PAST AND and and your ups and downs and
[57:01] yet he can see you exactly the way he
[57:04] saw you in his mind. That's the power of
[57:08] the blood. Can you say amen? That's how
[57:11] eternal his thoughts are. And there's
[57:14] nothing that can change it. Even the
[57:16] devil, as many accusations as he can
[57:19] bring forth about you to God, can never
[57:23] change God's mind toward you.
[57:27] &gt;&gt; I think that's awesome.
[57:29] &gt;&gt; So he says now, he said, "Now the only
[57:32] thing he can see you in is the way he
[57:34] saw you before the foundation of the
[57:36] world when he put your name in the
[57:38] lamb's book of life." That's all he can
[57:41] look at because you are redeemed. How
[57:43] many believes you're redeemed? Amen. I'm
[57:46] redeemed. Not going to be. I am
[57:48] redeemed. I have that inherit first
[57:50] fruits of of my inheritance. That's all
[57:53] he can look at because you are redeemed
[57:55] from everything that was ever done.
[57:58] You're washed or loosed in the blood of
[58:00] the lamb. Therefore, there's no gull in
[58:03] you. There's no unclean habit in you
[58:06] because that the blood of the lamb has
[58:09] did this. And God cannot. Everybody say
[58:12] God cannot. God cannot. Now, there's a
[58:15] difference in God cannot and God just
[58:17] chooses not to. God cannot. He doesn't
[58:21] just choose not to. He cannot impute sin
[58:26] to you after you've got a sin offering
[58:29] laying there waiting for you. Aren't you
[58:32] blessed for that? That's how powerful
[58:34] the blood atonement is. That's how
[58:37] perfect our sacrifice is. And God's the
[58:41] one that provided such a sacrifice.
[58:44] GOD'S THE ONE THAT CAME up with the plan
[58:46] of redemption. GOD'S THE ONE THAT THAT
[58:49] PROVIDED SUCH A BLOOD. Can you say amen?
[58:53] &gt;&gt; So in his mind, HE SAW YOU WITHOUT ANY
[58:57] SIN.
[58:58] &gt;&gt; And that's the way he still sees you.
[59:04] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[59:04] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[59:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. So before the foundation of the
[59:09] world, God uh placed the gene seed in
[59:12] you, which is the word seed that he uh
[59:16] of what he predestinated you to be.
[59:20] &gt;&gt; So that's what we're being changed to.
[59:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:23] &gt;&gt; No condemnation to them that are in
[59:25] Christ Jesus.
[59:27] &gt;&gt; Can't can't be changed if you're under
[59:29] condemnation.
[59:31] &gt;&gt; Can't get anywhere with God under
[59:33] condemnation. Ain't that right? So he
[59:36] takes that condemnation away from you.
[59:39] He brings a gospel that lets you know
[59:41] that you're free. Amen. That you don't
[59:43] have to knock down to the devil. Amen.
[59:46] You don't have to bear the load of sin.
[59:49] You're free. Can you say amen?
[59:51] &gt;&gt; Now the prophet says when a germ comes
[59:54] into the womb of the female, it don't
[59:56] take on. He says, "Well, you didn't
[59:59] become a human germ from your father.
[1:00:02] Then the next thing you become a germ
[1:00:04] from a dog and the next thing you become
[1:00:07] a cat and the next thing from a chicken.
[1:00:09] It was all human germ.
[1:00:13] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[1:00:14] &gt;&gt; So you didn't change germs from human,
[1:00:18] cat, monkey, giraffe, and then human.
[1:00:21] No, you was all human from the beginning
[1:00:24] all the way through your process all the
[1:00:26] way through the stages of development.
[1:00:29] Can you say amen? He says, "And the body
[1:00:32] of Jesus Christ, the bride will be part
[1:00:35] of his body."
[1:00:38] &gt;&gt; He was the word, and the bride will have
[1:00:41] to be the word. Word added to word, add
[1:00:44] to word, Luther's justification, Wesley
[1:00:47] sanctification, Pentecostal's baptism of
[1:00:50] the Holy Ghost, restoration of the
[1:00:52] gifts, and all the rest of it goes with
[1:00:54] it. It's got to be word on top of word,
[1:00:57] germ on top of germ. life on top of life
[1:01:01] to bring out the full stature of the
[1:01:04] bride of the Lord Jesus Christ. Ain't
[1:01:07] that right? Word, bride, word upon top
[1:01:10] of word upon top of word upon top of
[1:01:13] word. And you started out as a word.
[1:01:16] &gt;&gt; You started out as as as part of God.
[1:01:20] Ain't that right? So, so uh you might
[1:01:23] have uh you know you might have wandered
[1:01:25] into this thing and that thing and this
[1:01:28] thing but all along there was that gene
[1:01:31] seed that could not be touched
[1:01:36] &gt;&gt; contaminated or mixed up and and all of
[1:01:40] these things. Now, we know that a seed
[1:01:42] can lay dormant in the ground uh for
[1:01:45] years until the sunlight shines upon it
[1:01:51] and and the atmosphere becomes right
[1:01:55] &gt;&gt; and then the seed is quickened.
[1:01:57] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[1:01:59] &gt;&gt; And so this is the light of the esin.
[1:02:03] Amen. Has come in this age. Amen. And it
[1:02:07] has struck in and in in such a way,
[1:02:11] amen, that every seed of God, amen, that
[1:02:15] has been predestinated for this age is
[1:02:18] to come to its complete full stature of
[1:02:25] Jesus Christ. Ain't that right?
[1:02:27] &gt;&gt; It is then quickened. And so when when
[1:02:31] the sun comes and and quickens the seed
[1:02:34] then the change starts taking place.
[1:02:38] &gt;&gt; I I want to just say you know change is
[1:02:41] not easy.
[1:02:43] &gt;&gt; Change is hard.
[1:02:46] &gt;&gt; Uh because with change comes struggle.
[1:02:49] With change comes conflict and pushing
[1:02:54] and pressing and it it involves waring
[1:02:59] within ourselves.
[1:03:01] Amen. It and and nature tells us, you
[1:03:04] know, shows us uh in all kinds of ways,
[1:03:07] but you take the chicken, you know, when
[1:03:09] it's when it's time to be hatched out of
[1:03:12] that egg, the pressure it it takes the
[1:03:16] waring, the struggle. Amen. And and and
[1:03:20] no one can help it. Amen. It's got to do
[1:03:23] it within itself.
[1:03:25] &gt;&gt; It It's made to do it. Ain't that right?
[1:03:28] It's made to do it. And and even though
[1:03:31] it seemed like it's it's it's hard and
[1:03:34] and and it it's the same way with the
[1:03:36] butterfly, the caterpillar, you know,
[1:03:38] that goes in the cocoon and and and it's
[1:03:41] time to come out, you know, and and HE'S
[1:03:44] GOT TO PUSH and and you know, it's it's
[1:03:47] been told, you know, uh probably several
[1:03:49] people been reading a story of a a lady
[1:03:52] that uh saw, you know, a butterfly
[1:03:55] struggling trying to to to get out of
[1:03:57] that cocoon. And and so she took
[1:04:00] something and made a slit and and and
[1:04:02] opened that cocoon to help it out that
[1:04:04] that butterfly and and and realized that
[1:04:08] she had done damage to that. Amen.
[1:04:10] Through all of her compassion and
[1:04:12] feeling sorry for it, trying to help it
[1:04:14] along, uh she she she took away the her
[1:04:19] its freedom to where it could not fly.
[1:04:22] It it you see, it had to take the
[1:04:25] struggle. It it had to take the fight.
[1:04:28] It had to take the the the the pushing
[1:04:31] and the uh the pain and the the
[1:04:35] struggle. Amen. To build strength in it.
[1:04:38] Ain't that right? See, not everything is
[1:04:41] easy. Amen. Life isn't easy. And and the
[1:04:45] more you come to God, the more you you
[1:04:49] uh uh start to take on word, the more
[1:04:53] the struggle's going to be and the more
[1:04:56] the conflict is going to be. Amen.
[1:04:59] Because you you've uh uh that's just
[1:05:02] God's way. Amen. Is is the struggle.
[1:05:06] Amen. You know, I I think it's a miracle
[1:05:08] today that a man can change. Amen.
[1:05:11] because uh we want life to be so easy,
[1:05:15] you know, everybody wants to be rich,
[1:05:18] you know, quick and and looking for that
[1:05:21] pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.
[1:05:24] And no one wants to uh to labor. No one
[1:05:28] likes to struggle. And he he, you know,
[1:05:31] it's just a common way of man uh to find
[1:05:33] the least path of resistance. that God
[1:05:37] ain't going to let you go through the
[1:05:39] least path of resistance. Amen. There's
[1:05:42] got to be the struggle. Can you say
[1:05:44] amen? See, I'm I'm glad for change. I'M
[1:05:47] I'M GLAD FOR THAT OPPORTUNITY. But your
[1:05:50] opportunity for change lays in the
[1:05:53] struggles you go through and the pains
[1:05:56] and and the agonies and and THE TIMES
[1:05:59] THAT YOU YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO when
[1:06:02] you're YOU YOU'RE FALLING ON YOUR FACE
[1:06:04] AND before the Lord seeking his help,
[1:06:07] SEEKING HIS GUIDANCE.
[1:06:09] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:06:12] Now we are all free moral agents as as
[1:06:15] we know and we have a right to choose
[1:06:17] and a right to reject. It's the you know
[1:06:21] and and so with this you know we think
[1:06:23] that's freedom and and it is freedom but
[1:06:27] it's probably one of the hardest things
[1:06:29] is because God doesn't make decisions
[1:06:32] for you. Nobody can make decisions for
[1:06:35] you. We all come to the crossroads.
[1:06:38] Brother Brandham says you'll never leave
[1:06:39] a service the same. You'll either be
[1:06:42] worse off or you'll be better off. One
[1:06:44] of the two. But every time the word
[1:06:47] comes to us and the promises are
[1:06:49] preached, then we we are faced with the
[1:06:53] decisions of what we are to do with it.
[1:06:56] Can you say amen?
[1:06:58] &gt;&gt; And and so uh because we're free moral
[1:07:00] agents and uh uh being free to make our
[1:07:04] own choice, that's that's just the way
[1:07:07] God made it. It's it's he made us that
[1:07:10] way. So therefore, he will never force
[1:07:14] his self his way uh on anyone. For the
[1:07:19] prophet said he is a gentleman. Ain't
[1:07:21] that right?
[1:07:22] &gt;&gt; And and so uh uh you look at the age
[1:07:26] that we're living in, the most evil,
[1:07:29] horrible age. And the worst thing that
[1:07:32] that ever happened, I guess, is in this
[1:07:34] age is where Jesus is found on the
[1:07:37] outside of the church knocking trying to
[1:07:40] get back in because he was rejected the
[1:07:44] people by their choice. They and and I
[1:07:47] know it's a choice. You can say, "Well,
[1:07:49] they didn't have a chance and they were
[1:07:51] ignorant." No. NO. THEY HAD A CHOICE
[1:07:53] because God so vindicated this message.
[1:07:56] God so proved to this generation that IT
[1:08:01] WAS JESUS CHRIST THE same yesterday,
[1:08:03] today, and forever that was doing the
[1:08:06] works. And so they, Brother Brham says,
[1:08:09] you know, the Jews, they they were
[1:08:11] ignorant because God blinded them. But
[1:08:14] the people today are willfully ignorant.
[1:08:18] They they don't want the truth. So they
[1:08:20] made the choice to refuse it. And as the
[1:08:24] scripture prophesied, Jesus the word is
[1:08:27] found outside of his own church trying
[1:08:30] to get back in. Revelations 3:20 says,
[1:08:33] "Behold, I stand at the door and knock
[1:08:36] and if any man will hear my voice and
[1:08:39] and and his voice is his word. Hear my
[1:08:41] word, open the door, I will come into
[1:08:44] him and will suck with him and he with
[1:08:47] me." Right
[1:08:48] &gt;&gt; now you know the prophet tells us that
[1:08:51] this this leota means people's rights
[1:08:55] &gt;&gt; and this is the age where all nations
[1:08:58] and have risen up and demanded equality
[1:09:02] socially and financially and we're
[1:09:05] living in the age of he said of the
[1:09:07] communists where all men are supposedly
[1:09:10] equal though it is only so in theory.
[1:09:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. But but everybody wants their
[1:09:16] rights. And and in in in other words, no
[1:09:19] one wants to surrender to another man's
[1:09:21] will. No one everybody wants to be on
[1:09:24] top. Everybody wants to be the king.
[1:09:27] Everybody wants to be seen and and and
[1:09:31] known and uh uh successful or whatever
[1:09:35] you want to say. And and so uh it's it's
[1:09:38] this age of of uh people's rights that
[1:09:43] they have decided to kick Christ out.
[1:09:48] And so now he's knocking wanting back
[1:09:51] in. But he's not going to force himself
[1:09:54] in. Right?
[1:09:56] &gt;&gt; It he's just simply asking a man to be
[1:10:00] let in. It's not a forced entry. This
[1:10:03] message does not force itself on no one.
[1:10:09] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:10:11] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:10:13] &gt;&gt; It I know now men try to take this
[1:10:15] message and try to cram it down people's
[1:10:18] throat and make them live godly and make
[1:10:20] them act right. But this message is
[1:10:24] Christ
[1:10:26] &gt;&gt; and you can have you have the choice
[1:10:28] either to take it or accept and accept
[1:10:30] it or reject it. That's right.
[1:10:33] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:10:34] &gt;&gt; You have the choice to use it as your
[1:10:36] guide
[1:10:38] or you you can do your own thing. You
[1:10:42] you have the CHOICE TO COMPLY WITH IT or
[1:10:45] or not. It It's totally your choice.
[1:10:48] It's my choice. It's it's the choice of
[1:10:51] every man, woman, boy, girl.
[1:10:53] &gt;&gt; Yeah. And so now it's in this age THOUGH
[1:10:58] THAT GOD IS CALLING OUT A people for his
[1:11:02] name.
[1:11:03] &gt;&gt; Not forcing them
[1:11:06] but just calling THEM OUT.
[1:11:10] &gt;&gt; CALLING THEM OUT. THIS IS THE time that
[1:11:13] he would call a people out for his name
[1:11:16] and he is having preeminence in that
[1:11:20] group of people that come out. Amen.
[1:11:24] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:11:25] &gt;&gt; Now, the prophet said, "Even though
[1:11:27] Jesus doesn't force open the door, he
[1:11:30] gives you the ability to let him in."
[1:11:34] Ain't that right?
[1:11:36] &gt;&gt; You have the ability to let him in. Now,
[1:11:40] so then we find that if it's if it's our
[1:11:45] choice, if it's up to us to let him in,
[1:11:49] then there has to be a surrender on our
[1:11:53] part
[1:11:55] to even have a relationship with Christ.
[1:11:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:00] And you you understand for a
[1:12:03] relationship which which that's what God
[1:12:05] is wanting is a relationship between
[1:12:08] Christ and his bride, there has to be a
[1:12:11] surrender.
[1:12:12] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? And the surrender is
[1:12:14] on our part. He's not the one
[1:12:16] surrendering. He surrendered. Christ
[1:12:18] surrendered to the will of the father uh
[1:12:21] uh when back 2,000 years ago. And now
[1:12:25] here we are as the bride surrendering to
[1:12:29] the will of the father in our day. Can
[1:12:32] you say amen?
[1:12:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:34] &gt;&gt; Now surrender happens because of a
[1:12:37] desire within you to let him in.
[1:12:41] Surrender
[1:12:43] and that desire is a creation as the
[1:12:46] prophet said. It's not something that
[1:12:48] just happened to be in you. And I think
[1:12:51] that's the beautiful part is that if you
[1:12:54] have a desire to serve God, that's God.
[1:12:59] That's it's it's because God created a
[1:13:02] desire in you.
[1:13:04] &gt;&gt; So God forsaw you before the foundation
[1:13:06] of the world. This is he's determined
[1:13:08] it. He's he's he's declared it and and
[1:13:12] to be so. But then he places a desire
[1:13:15] within us. And and again, if you have
[1:13:18] that desire to serve God, don't take
[1:13:20] that for granted
[1:13:21] &gt;&gt; because a lot of folks don't have that
[1:13:23] today. If you have the desire to
[1:13:26] surrender your whole life to God, don't
[1:13:28] take that for granted. And you cannot
[1:13:29] blame others that don't have that desire
[1:13:32] because it was a a creation that God did
[1:13:36] within you.
[1:13:37] &gt;&gt; The Lord,
[1:13:39] &gt;&gt; can you say amen?
[1:13:41] &gt;&gt; So now, don't think for a minute that
[1:13:44] you are the one that's wanting God.
[1:13:46] Yeah.
[1:13:47] &gt;&gt; And desiring God. And then, you know,
[1:13:50] you're trying to get God's attention.
[1:13:52] You know, sometimes I think that's
[1:13:54] that's the way we feel sometimes when we
[1:13:56] go into prayer or when we're when we're
[1:13:59] going out throughout the day that it's
[1:14:01] like we're trying to get God's
[1:14:02] attention. When we get sick and and it
[1:14:05] seem like nothing's happening, we're
[1:14:07] trying to get God's attention and and
[1:14:09] all these things. And but you know, I I
[1:14:12] uh I just don't believe I think we've
[1:14:14] had God's attention before he had our
[1:14:16] attention.
[1:14:18] &gt;&gt; I I think I I just believe that if we
[1:14:21] were in the mind of God, then then all
[1:14:23] of his attention was focused upon us and
[1:14:27] and every promise that he has made
[1:14:29] throughout the years that is compiled up
[1:14:32] in the into the Bible. Amen. It's it's
[1:14:36] promises made because he was thinking of
[1:14:40] us.
[1:14:41] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:14:41] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Do you believe that?
[1:14:44] See, so so I I I can't find in the
[1:14:47] scriptures where God does not like to do
[1:14:50] things for his people. I I I just can't
[1:14:53] find it in the scriptures that God
[1:14:55] changes his mind concerning his
[1:14:58] promises. But everywhere I see in the
[1:15:01] Bible, God wants to bless his children.
[1:15:05] God wants to bless his people. Can you
[1:15:07] say amen? He wants to heal you. HE WANTS
[1:15:10] TO SAVE YOU. HE WANTS TO fill you with
[1:15:13] the Holy Ghost. If you ain't got the
[1:15:14] Holy Ghost, he wants to give it to you.
[1:15:16] Amen. He wants to If you're needing
[1:15:18] deliverance, he wants to deliver you. If
[1:15:20] you're needing help, he wants to help
[1:15:23] you.
[1:15:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's that's just the truth.
[1:15:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. See, there's only one who seeks to
[1:15:30] kill, steal, and destroy, and that's
[1:15:32] your enemy, the devil. True. True.
[1:15:35] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[1:15:36] &gt;&gt; But not only does God want to do things
[1:15:39] for his people, but he wants to do it
[1:15:42] MORE THAN YOU WANT HIM.
[1:15:44] &gt;&gt; It's what a prophet said.
[1:15:47] &gt;&gt; He wants to do it more than we want him
[1:15:49] to do it. So you you don't don't let the
[1:15:52] devil tell you that God isn't for you,
[1:15:55] &gt;&gt; that God isn't with you, and and you
[1:15:58] know, why would he save you if he didn't
[1:16:00] love you? Right.
[1:16:02] &gt;&gt; I I understand you know that sometimes
[1:16:04] we feel saved, sometime we don't. But
[1:16:06] you don't go by feelings.
[1:16:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:09] &gt;&gt; But if God saved you, then he saved you
[1:16:11] for eternal.
[1:16:12] &gt;&gt; If if he if if he's done something for
[1:16:15] you, it's because it's he's doing an
[1:16:17] eternal work in your life.
[1:16:21] &gt;&gt; A ain't that right? Why would he fill
[1:16:23] you with the Holy Ghost if he didn't
[1:16:24] intend to keep you?
[1:16:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. The Bible says that the Holy Ghost
[1:16:28] is a seal and we're sealed with the Holy
[1:16:31] Spirit of promise until the day of our
[1:16:34] redemption. Can you say amen?
[1:16:36] &gt;&gt; So, how how is it that you got the
[1:16:39] desire to serve the Lord? The the want
[1:16:43] to to walk close with him and and to
[1:16:47] serve him, to please him and walk with
[1:16:50] him. Well, that didn't come by you,
[1:16:53] &gt;&gt; right? Yeah.
[1:16:54] &gt;&gt; Like God's just doing his own thing and
[1:16:56] ALL OF A SUDDEN A DESIRE HITS AND you're
[1:16:57] like, "God, I want TO WALK WITH YOU.
[1:16:59] GOD, I WANT TO TALK WITH YOU. GOD, I
[1:17:01] WANT TO DO I I I WANT TO LIVE FOR YOU. I
[1:17:03] WANT THAT RELATIONSHIP.
[1:17:06] &gt;&gt; God wanted the relationship with you."
[1:17:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:09] &gt;&gt; That's why he put that desire in your
[1:17:11] heart.
[1:17:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:13] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:17:15] See, so brother Bram says before there
[1:17:18] is a desire created in your heart, there
[1:17:20] has to be a creator to create that
[1:17:23] creation.
[1:17:24] &gt;&gt; And if God desires uh uh creates a
[1:17:28] desire within a person, a man uh uh a
[1:17:31] desire for something, it's because that
[1:17:34] desire, amen, THERE'S SOMETHING FOR
[1:17:38] THEM.
[1:17:39] &gt;&gt; They're desiring something. THERE'S
[1:17:41] SOMETHING THERE FOR them or they
[1:17:44] wouldn't desire it.
[1:17:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:47] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:17:48] &gt;&gt; See, the desire wouldn't be there IF
[1:17:51] THERE WASN'T SOMETHING THERE to fulfill
[1:17:54] that desire.
[1:17:55] &gt;&gt; YOU WANT MORE OF GOD, IT'S BECAUSE
[1:17:58] THERE'S MORE OF GOD TO BE HAD.
[1:18:00] &gt;&gt; IF YOU'RE DESIRING HEAVEN, IT'S BECAUSE
[1:18:03] THERE'S A HEAVEN FOR YOU.
[1:18:05] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:18:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:06] &gt;&gt; The desire. Amen. So we find, brother
[1:18:11] Bram said, if you believe in divine
[1:18:12] healing and there is something in you
[1:18:14] that says there's healing somewhere,
[1:18:17] then there's bound to be a creator to
[1:18:20] create that desire.
[1:18:22] &gt;&gt; And if there's a desire in you, your
[1:18:25] heart to be healed by divine healing,
[1:18:28] then there's a fountain open somewhere.
[1:18:31] &gt;&gt; And the prophet said, you couldn't have
[1:18:33] that desire if there wasn't. If there
[1:18:35] was no fountain of healing, if there was
[1:18:37] if there WAS NOT A FOUNTAIN OF BLOOD,
[1:18:40] AMEN, to wash your sins away, you
[1:18:42] wouldn't have had that desire to have
[1:18:44] your sins washed away.
[1:18:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:48] &gt;&gt; So, whatever it is that you're desiring
[1:18:52] of God, it's already there for you.
[1:18:58] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:18:59] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:19:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. See, so then we find, you know,
[1:19:05] uh, not too long ago when the church got
[1:19:08] all formal and
[1:19:11] dried up and settled down to ritualistic
[1:19:14] forms of worship and well then the
[1:19:18] people began to crave more of God.
[1:19:22] &gt;&gt; They began to desire more of the Lord.
[1:19:26] Well, you know, the prophet said, "Then
[1:19:28] the baptism of the Holy Spirit came into
[1:19:31] existence." See, see, they were
[1:19:34] hungering for it AND GOD FULFILLED THAT
[1:19:38] DESIRE.
[1:19:40] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[1:19:41] &gt;&gt; See, so now, now listen, church. What
[1:19:44] would it be if God didn't create the
[1:19:46] hunger? If God didn't create the desire
[1:19:49] within us, how awful that would be.
[1:19:52] &gt;&gt; Because we, man, would be stuck in
[1:19:54] ritual.
[1:19:56] &gt;&gt; We would just be like the rest of the
[1:19:58] world, just going through the hundrum OF
[1:20:00] LIFE,
[1:20:01] &gt;&gt; JUST SATISFIED WITH ANYTHING, looking
[1:20:04] back to years of yesterday years,
[1:20:07] yesterday, and and all that happened
[1:20:09] back then. See, it it would just we
[1:20:12] would just be SETTLED DOWN TO FORMS of
[1:20:15] worship.
[1:20:16] You know, it was it was God that began
[1:20:20] to steer Luther's heart.
[1:20:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. For more of him.
[1:20:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. He created desire in Luther.
[1:20:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because there was something to be
[1:20:30] had.
[1:20:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. Everybody else had just settled
[1:20:33] down to Catholicism.
[1:20:36] settled down and knucked down to the
[1:20:38] rituals and the creeds and traditions.
[1:20:41] AMEN. BUT GOD WOULD PUT A DESIRE in
[1:20:45] Luther's heart. Amen. And and the elect
[1:20:48] of that age. Amen. And it would call
[1:20:52] them. Amen. They were calling for more
[1:20:54] of God. And God gave it to them.
[1:20:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right.
[1:20:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:59] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Then after a while the
[1:21:02] people settled right back down to the
[1:21:04] humundrum of life. They settled back
[1:21:07] down to denominations
[1:21:09] uh denominationalism to creeds forms of
[1:21:12] worship and all of that. AND THEN GOD
[1:21:16] PREPARED A people
[1:21:18] &gt;&gt; and he CREATED A HUNGER WITHIN THEM TO
[1:21:21] DESIRE for more of him. Can you say
[1:21:24] amen?
[1:21:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. And he sent a messenger of John
[1:21:28] Wesley with the message.
[1:21:30] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? Amen. And it raised
[1:21:33] the church out of the tradition that
[1:21:35] they were in.
[1:21:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:37] &gt;&gt; Then again, the people settled down for
[1:21:40] traditions. Settled down to all kinds of
[1:21:43] stuff. See, they didn't they didn't know
[1:21:45] what God's plan was. So, they just
[1:21:47] settled down after the revival was over,
[1:21:50] you know. And and the prophet says, you
[1:21:52] know, it doesn't take long for people to
[1:21:54] settle down after revival. Amen. After
[1:21:56] Luther went off the scene, the people
[1:21:58] just started settling down. Amen. Went
[1:22:00] right back in the humdrum of life. After
[1:22:02] Wesley went off the scene, the people,
[1:22:04] Amen, it just seemed like it wasn't long
[1:22:06] until the people just went back into the
[1:22:08] humdrum of life. Amen. Even the prophet
[1:22:11] talks about how that after the day of
[1:22:13] Pentecost, Amen. men's hearts begin to
[1:22:16] cool down. The revival fire begin to
[1:22:19] cool down. Ain't that right? SO, IT'S
[1:22:22] ALWAYS BEEN God initiating it.
[1:22:27] &gt;&gt; ALWAYS BEEN GOD. AMEN. Remembering his
[1:22:31] plan, REMEMBERING WHAT HE HAS DESIRED OF
[1:22:35] MAN.
[1:22:36] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:22:37] &gt;&gt; So, when man settled back down, then God
[1:22:40] sent a man a created desire in the
[1:22:43] hearts of men and women. Amen. And that
[1:22:46] oneeyed black man, I can't remember his
[1:22:48] name, Seymour. Amen. Begin to pray. Uh
[1:22:52] uh history says he began to pray 8 hours
[1:22:54] a day having his head in an old apple
[1:22:57] cita and he is praying for a move of
[1:23:00] God. People all around begin to pray.
[1:23:03] Amen. For a GREAT MOVE OF GOD and God
[1:23:07] answered their prayers.
[1:23:09] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:23:09] &gt;&gt; What they were desiring, God had for
[1:23:12] them.
[1:23:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:14] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:23:16] &gt;&gt; But are we a people without hunger? ARE
[1:23:19] WE A PEOPLE WITHOUT A DESIRE? Oh no, no,
[1:23:22] no. AMEN. SEE, PENTECOST HAS SETTLED
[1:23:25] BACK DOWN. They have gone back to
[1:23:27] ritualism. They have gone to Amen. the
[1:23:30] ways of man again. Amen. To where
[1:23:32] they're so cold they they wouldn't know
[1:23:34] of the power of God if it slapped them
[1:23:36] in the face.
[1:23:37] &gt;&gt; They wouldn't know it.
[1:23:38] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:23:40] &gt;&gt; But here we are under our messenger of
[1:23:44] Malachi 4.
[1:23:46] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:23:48] Can you say amen? Each time that God
[1:23:51] created a a hunger for more of God in
[1:23:53] the age, that church would move up a
[1:23:56] little bit more. Move up a little bit
[1:23:58] higher. Amen. Move up. Ain't that right?
[1:24:01] So, the church hasn't been just spinning
[1:24:03] its wheels going from cycle to cycle to
[1:24:06] cycle, getting nowhere. God has been
[1:24:08] bringing the church up and up and up.
[1:24:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:13] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[1:24:15] So here we are a people under the
[1:24:17] message of Malachi 4. And with that
[1:24:22] is is bringing another birth pain.
[1:24:26] &gt;&gt; And I'll I'll say it this way. It's the
[1:24:28] final and last birth pain.
[1:24:32] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:24:32] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:24:34] &gt;&gt; For we're living in the final age.
[1:24:37] And we we REALIZE THAT WE ARE THAT FINAL
[1:24:42] VOICE. THAT'S RIGHT.
[1:24:44] &gt;&gt; AMEN. That's right.
[1:24:45] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:24:46] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:24:47] &gt;&gt; And and we also REALIZE THAT PENTECOST
[1:24:51] COULD NOT MEET THE CONDITIONS OF A
[1:24:53] RAPTURE.
[1:24:54] &gt;&gt; RIGHT. TRUE.
[1:24:56] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:24:57] &gt;&gt; CAN YOU SAY AMEN?
[1:24:58] &gt;&gt; SO, IT TOOK A GOD WOULDN'T FORCE A
[1:25:02] PEOPLE OUT. HE WOULD CREATE A DESIRE
[1:25:04] WITHIN HIS ELECT AND THEY WOULD BEGIN TO
[1:25:07] CRY FOR MORE OF GOD. THEY WOULD BEGIN TO
[1:25:09] PRESS FOR MORE OF GOD. THAT'S RIGHT.
[1:25:11] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen
[1:25:13] &gt;&gt; to meet the end time conditions? See, so
[1:25:16] we're living in the final age, final
[1:25:19] voice. Prophet said, living voices,
[1:25:22] &gt;&gt; the word to be made flesh.
[1:25:25] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:25:26] &gt;&gt; It isn't just educated preachers and and
[1:25:29] and and fine seminaries and and trained
[1:25:34] uh uh choir, all that. It's lived
[1:25:36] voices. It's the word actually taking
[1:25:40] form within the human being.
[1:25:44] &gt;&gt; Now the prophet says under every
[1:25:47] prophet's message,
[1:25:50] Israel got a birth pain because that
[1:25:52] these prophets would come on the scene
[1:25:55] after the theologians and clergymen
[1:25:58] would have the church all in an
[1:26:00] organization form. And when them
[1:26:03] prophets come on the scene with thus
[1:26:04] said the Lord, they shook them churches
[1:26:07] and she had a birth pain.
[1:26:10] &gt;&gt; Finally, she had birth painans plum on
[1:26:12] up till she delivered a son of the
[1:26:13] gospel which is the was the word itself
[1:26:16] made flesh. So the church really is in
[1:26:20] birth painans tonight.
[1:26:23] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:26:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now I know uh you know the the
[1:26:27] ministers you know in brother Brandham's
[1:26:29] day they they always they they talk
[1:26:31] about brother Brandham highly in the
[1:26:34] fact that he never missed it in in his
[1:26:37] discernment very humble man the presence
[1:26:40] of God was with him but they always say
[1:26:42] he missed it he missed it he missed it
[1:26:44] we can't understand his doctrines and
[1:26:46] all that but they don't understand A
[1:26:50] PROPHET WAS BRINGING BIRTH painans to
[1:26:53] the church.
[1:26:55] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:26:57] &gt;&gt; Shaking us from that ritualism. Shaking
[1:27:00] us from that, you know, if I call it
[1:27:02] that Pentecostal age.
[1:27:04] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:27:05] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:27:07] &gt;&gt; And so he says, you know, he says now,
[1:27:10] he says, so the really the church really
[1:27:13] is in birth painans tonight again for
[1:27:15] the deliverance of the son of God to
[1:27:18] come again. All of our theologians, all
[1:27:20] of our systems, all of our denominations
[1:27:23] has rotted out from under us.
[1:27:26] &gt;&gt; Luther didn't even have what it took to
[1:27:28] bring on a rapture.
[1:27:29] &gt;&gt; All through the ages, there was nothing,
[1:27:32] amen, uh to uh uh that was capable of
[1:27:35] bringing a rapture on.
[1:27:38] &gt;&gt; But here in this age, there's a message
[1:27:41] &gt;&gt; to get us ready.
[1:27:43] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:27:45] Amen.
[1:27:46] &gt;&gt; So he says, "We are in birth pain."
[1:27:49] Everybody say, "I'm in birth pain."
[1:27:53] &gt;&gt; And a message from God always through
[1:27:56] the church in heavier pain, but after a
[1:28:00] while, she's going to be delivered of a
[1:28:01] bride
[1:28:02] &gt;&gt; that'll bring forth Jesus Christ to his
[1:28:06] bride. Can you say amen?
[1:28:08] &gt;&gt; So each age, birth pain. A little bit
[1:28:10] harder birth pain, a little bit harder
[1:28:13] birth pain. and and and right at the
[1:28:15] time of deliverance, the heaviest birth
[1:28:18] pains and the church, it's happened to
[1:28:20] the church as a whole throughout the
[1:28:22] ages. Can you say amen?
[1:28:25] &gt;&gt; But it also happens to us as
[1:28:28] individuals.
[1:28:30] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[1:28:30] &gt;&gt; Yes, it does.
[1:28:32] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[1:28:33] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:28:33] &gt;&gt; And the message that we are under brings
[1:28:38] such birth pains.
[1:28:40] &gt;&gt; That's right. Yeah.
[1:28:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:43] IT IT BRINGS SUCH STRUGGLE.
[1:28:48] &gt;&gt; It It brings such a a pressure, if I
[1:28:53] could say it that way. Not it's not in a
[1:28:56] bad way.
[1:28:57] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:28:59] &gt;&gt; But see, Satan, he wants to anoint us
[1:29:02] with unbelief
[1:29:04] in God's word.
[1:29:06] &gt;&gt; He wants you to believe that nothing is
[1:29:09] happening in the message. Yeah,
[1:29:10] &gt;&gt; the message is not effective.
[1:29:13] &gt;&gt; Oh my
[1:29:14] &gt;&gt; in the church, in the world, in my life.
[1:29:18] We're just, you know, he he wants us to
[1:29:20] settle down to the humdrum of life.
[1:29:23] &gt;&gt; But I promise you this, this bride will
[1:29:25] not go that way.
[1:29:27] &gt;&gt; She can't.
[1:29:30] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon said it will not
[1:29:32] denominate.
[1:29:34] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? The church ain't this
[1:29:36] bride ain't going to do that.
[1:29:37] &gt;&gt; Yeah. See? So, but this message is
[1:29:41] effective to those who surrender to it.
[1:29:48] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:29:50] &gt;&gt; THIS MESSAGE IS THE CAPSTONE.
[1:29:53] &gt;&gt; THIS MESSAGE IS CHRIST,
[1:29:57] &gt;&gt; our head.
[1:29:59] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:30:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. See, so now without this message,
[1:30:06] God is just nothing MORE BUT A GOD OF
[1:30:10] HISTORY.
[1:30:11] &gt;&gt; COME ON, think about it.
[1:30:13] &gt;&gt; There is no message on this in this
[1:30:16] world today that can bring God out of
[1:30:18] history.
[1:30:20] &gt;&gt; Pentecostal message ain't got it.
[1:30:21] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:30:22] &gt;&gt; Presbyterian message ain't got it.
[1:30:24] Baptist message, they can't bring God
[1:30:26] out of history. Church of Christ,
[1:30:28] whatever message there is out in this
[1:30:29] world today, there there's nothing that
[1:30:32] can bring God out of history.
[1:30:34] &gt;&gt; But there is a message,
[1:30:38] &gt;&gt; OF MALACHI 4
[1:30:41] THAT HAS GOT THE POWER TO MAKE JESUS
[1:30:44] CHRIST the same yesterday, today, and
[1:30:46] forever to those who surrender to it.
[1:30:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:51] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:30:53] I hope you know this makes some sense to
[1:30:56] you.
[1:30:57] &gt;&gt; But what was the prophet? The prophet
[1:30:59] was the stonemason
[1:31:02] that took this message and began to
[1:31:05] shape because remember God was calling
[1:31:08] for a change.
[1:31:09] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:31:12] &gt;&gt; Change in church ritual, change in
[1:31:15] family, CHANGE IN INDIVIDUALS. God want
[1:31:18] a change.
[1:31:20] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Come on. Can you say amen?
[1:31:24] &gt;&gt; And and so God would send a prophet with
[1:31:28] a message THAT WOULD BEGIN TO SHAPE and
[1:31:32] and take a people.
[1:31:35] Well, you know, Brother Brandham, he
[1:31:37] said this. He said, "What good is a
[1:31:39] stone?" And brother Brandon talks about
[1:31:41] the stone being our confession.
[1:31:45] &gt;&gt; That he said, "What good is a stone?" In
[1:31:47] other words, what good is a confession
[1:31:48] to say, "I'm a believer. I'm a
[1:31:50] Christian. and I go to church and I'm
[1:31:52] this
[1:31:53] if there isn't a stonemason there to
[1:31:56] shape him into a son of God.
[1:31:59] &gt;&gt; That's exactly right.
[1:32:00] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:32:02] &gt;&gt; That's what's making you different
[1:32:04] &gt;&gt; than the rest
[1:32:06] &gt;&gt; of of churchity.
[1:32:08] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:32:10] &gt;&gt; You're just piling up a bunch of rocks.
[1:32:13] Is that right? It isn't doing any a bit
[1:32:15] of good. The water we wearth the way the
[1:32:18] stone. See, that's right. That's the
[1:32:20] people. What good is stones if you
[1:32:22] haven't got a true stonemason with the
[1:32:25] sharp good sharp tool to shape him into
[1:32:28] the fitting place in the house of God?
[1:32:30] Just want to ask you, what's the good
[1:32:32] what goods the decisions? What good you
[1:32:36] putting your name on the book? What good
[1:32:39] is it to join the church if the
[1:32:41] stonemason ISN'T THERE? THAT'LL SHAPE
[1:32:44] THAT AND MAKE THEM QUIT THIS AND QUIT
[1:32:47] THAT and cut them and make them over
[1:32:50] this way and square them up and make
[1:32:52] them like Christians that sit in the
[1:32:54] house of God with signs following the
[1:32:57] believer.
[1:32:58] &gt;&gt; HE SAID THAT'S END TIME evangelism is
[1:33:02] taking the stones and shaping them.
[1:33:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:33:08] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Now, that's why we get
[1:33:11] miserable.
[1:33:14] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:33:15] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:33:16] &gt;&gt; That's why we get kind of um
[1:33:20] I don't know what you'd call it. Well,
[1:33:23] uh we're miserable.
[1:33:25] Is because there's a honing that is
[1:33:29] going on by this message.
[1:33:32] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:33:33] &gt;&gt; And it's shaping us.
[1:33:36] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:33:36] &gt;&gt; True.
[1:33:37] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:33:38] Hello.
[1:33:40] &gt;&gt; And it's not doing it by force.
[1:33:45] &gt;&gt; We are surrendering ourselves to it.
[1:33:51] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:33:51] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:33:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:56] &gt;&gt; We realize that
[1:33:58] not only do we have a desire to be with
[1:34:01] God and to be like God, how many wants
[1:34:02] to be like God?
[1:34:04] &gt;&gt; I certainly want to. I want to reflect
[1:34:07] him in every aspect of my life.
[1:34:10] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:34:11] &gt;&gt; I'm finding out more and more that in
[1:34:14] order to do that, I've got to surrender
[1:34:16] to this message.
[1:34:18] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:34:19] &gt;&gt; It It's not for me to correct the
[1:34:22] message. It's not for me to say I
[1:34:25] believe the message and take my own
[1:34:27] thoughts whenever I want to. I must
[1:34:30] surrender everything to it.
[1:34:35] Can you say amen?
[1:34:38] &gt;&gt; Then we find out as we the more we
[1:34:40] surrender to it, we find out that we
[1:34:44] don't handle things the way we'd
[1:34:46] normally handle it. We went and do
[1:34:48] things the in the same way that a normal
[1:34:51] human being would because the message is
[1:34:54] guiding us. The message is shaping us.
[1:34:57] So, so when when you know when a
[1:35:00] situation arises and and you could you
[1:35:03] YOU HAVE EVERY RIGHT to to lay blame and
[1:35:06] and to get mad and to HOLD HARD feelings
[1:35:09] and and all of that you find in the
[1:35:12] message is is taking a different route.
[1:35:15] Amen. Now, that's the way we would take
[1:35:17] it as church members and split a church
[1:35:19] and divide and complain and grumble, but
[1:35:22] we're finding ourselves yielding to a
[1:35:24] message.
[1:35:26] Amen.
[1:35:28] &gt;&gt; And the message tells us that love is
[1:35:30] the strongest weapon
[1:35:33] &gt;&gt; ever given to man.
[1:35:34] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:35:35] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:35:36] &gt;&gt; Love. Can you say amen?
[1:35:38] &gt;&gt; Talked about when when the man came and
[1:35:41] going to kill him, HE SAID SATAN CREATED
[1:35:45] A hatred in that man.
[1:35:47] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:35:48] &gt;&gt; He said the only way to handle that was
[1:35:50] by divine love.
[1:35:52] &gt;&gt; I love that man.
[1:35:54] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? That's what he said.
[1:35:56] &gt;&gt; See, he says, "Now, I was a boxer.
[1:35:58] Brother Brand was a boxer.
[1:36:00] &gt;&gt; He was very well trained." And so this
[1:36:02] man, this man was threatened to whoop
[1:36:04] HIM, KNOCK HIM OUT. WELL, IT WOULD HAVE
[1:36:06] been instant, automatic, instant. Uh
[1:36:08] just just go back to your old days and
[1:36:11] say, "I'll handle this one. I'll take
[1:36:14] you out."
[1:36:14] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:36:16] &gt;&gt; He was trained to do it.
[1:36:18] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:36:19] &gt;&gt; But that's not the way of the maker.
[1:36:21] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:36:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:23] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? remember when the
[1:36:26] couple and you could hear it on tape
[1:36:27] when they were making love on in the
[1:36:29] church while brother Brown's talking and
[1:36:31] all of a sudden he gets death quiet
[1:36:34] &gt;&gt; and he says stop that
[1:36:37] &gt;&gt; and I mean everything goes quiet
[1:36:40] &gt;&gt; and I think he said it again I said stop
[1:36:42] that
[1:36:42] &gt;&gt; that's right
[1:36:44] &gt;&gt; and you could hear the sternness in his
[1:36:45] voice
[1:36:47] but the angel of the Lord told him
[1:36:49] there's a trap for you
[1:36:51] &gt;&gt; and he told the church there's a trap
[1:36:52] waiting for me Right.
[1:36:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. And and he says, "I could have
[1:36:57] called fire down. I could have done
[1:36:59] whatever I wanted to. It was in my
[1:37:01] power." The Lord told him it was in his
[1:37:03] power to do whatever. And he said, "I
[1:37:06] forgive you.
[1:37:08] &gt;&gt; I forgive you." And it broke it.
[1:37:11] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:37:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:13] &gt;&gt; True.
[1:37:13] &gt;&gt; That's right. Brother Ed Dalton talking
[1:37:15] to him uh that was there and he says
[1:37:18] that you know they were he was with
[1:37:20] brother Brandham uh at the end of the
[1:37:23] service or after service and brother Ram
[1:37:25] got his hat and he uh when they went
[1:37:28] outside brother Brandham just threw it
[1:37:29] up in the air and jumped UP AND SAID,
[1:37:31] "YEP, I PASSED THE TEST."
[1:37:38] &gt;&gt; You see, God's having a test for all of
[1:37:40] us.
[1:37:41] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? See, and and it's it's
[1:37:44] not him. You better do this and you
[1:37:47] better do that. It's a surrendering.
[1:37:50] &gt;&gt; I hope you understand. Now, notice Mark
[1:37:54] 11:24. Therefore, I say unto you, what
[1:37:56] thingsoever you desire?
[1:38:00] When when did where did that desire come
[1:38:02] from? God created that desire.
[1:38:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. Whatsoever things you desire when
[1:38:07] you pray, believe that you receive them
[1:38:09] and you shall have them. Well, as
[1:38:12] believers, our desire isn't for wealth
[1:38:15] of the world. Yeah.
[1:38:16] &gt;&gt; Our our desire isn't for riches and
[1:38:18] fame. Our desires, you know, I I know
[1:38:22] that that God blesses us with money and
[1:38:24] he blesses us with monetary things. He
[1:38:28] blesses his people with with if you need
[1:38:30] a job, he'll bless you. If you need
[1:38:32] money, he'll bless you with that. If you
[1:38:34] need a a car, a home, OR WHATEVER, GOD
[1:38:37] BLESSES his people with those things.
[1:38:40] Can you say amen? BUT THOSE THINGS DOES
[1:38:42] NOT DRIVE US.
[1:38:44] &gt;&gt; WHAT DRIVES US IS A DESIRE FOR MORE OF
[1:38:47] HIM.
[1:38:48] &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT.
[1:38:50] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:38:51] &gt;&gt; See, and notice OUR DESIRE IS NOT THE
[1:38:55] DESIRE that a sinner would have OR OR AN
[1:38:58] UNGODLY WOULD HAVE. OUR DESIRE matches
[1:39:01] his desire.
[1:39:03] &gt;&gt; GOD DESIRED in the beginning TO HAVE
[1:39:05] FELLOWSHIP WITH YOU AND I. GOD DESIRED
[1:39:08] IN THE BEGINNING. AMEN. TO HAVE US AS
[1:39:10] HIS BRIDE AND TO UNITE. GOD DESIRED,
[1:39:14] AMEN, IN THE BEGINNING THAT WE WOULD
[1:39:16] LIVE WITH HIM FOREVER AND EVER.
[1:39:19] &gt;&gt; THAT WAS GOD'S DESIRE. THAT'S WHAT HE
[1:39:21] PREDESTINATED us for. And that desire
[1:39:24] that HE CREATED WITHIN US MATCHES his
[1:39:26] desire.
[1:39:27] &gt;&gt; Amen to God. Amen to God.
[1:39:30] &gt;&gt; You believe that?
[1:39:32] &gt;&gt; He desires to walk with us. He desires
[1:39:35] to manifest himself in us and through
[1:39:38] us. He desires to have preeminence in
[1:39:40] us. He desires to for us to reflect his
[1:39:43] image.
[1:39:46] &gt;&gt; Bless the name of the Lord.
[1:39:50] &gt;&gt; Do you love him?
[1:39:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:53] &gt;&gt; So his desire, that desire that he
[1:39:56] created within us is his desire.
[1:40:00] It's his desire that he's created. You
[1:40:03] see, he doesn't want conflict between us
[1:40:06] and him. If this message is making a
[1:40:09] conflict
[1:40:10] between you and God, something's wrong.
[1:40:14] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? This isn't to make us
[1:40:17] enemies to God.
[1:40:20] That's right.
[1:40:21] &gt;&gt; Yes, IT'S THE GREATEST MESSAGE. BUT GOD
[1:40:23] WOULD CREATE A DESIRE WITHIN US.
[1:40:26] &gt;&gt; THAT WHEN we hear the message, when we
[1:40:28] hear the promises, when we HEAR WHAT THE
[1:40:31] PROPHET IS TEACHING US, THERE'S A DESIRE
[1:40:33] within us. Say, "God, make me more like
[1:40:36] you."
[1:40:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:37] &gt;&gt; And there comes a struggle with that.
[1:40:42] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:40:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:40:44] &gt;&gt; You have to press into it. Hello.
[1:40:47] &gt;&gt; Yeah. because your old will does not
[1:40:49] your old ways, your old flesh does not
[1:40:51] want to conform.
[1:40:54] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? And that's where the
[1:40:55] battle is. Remember the the black bird
[1:40:57] or the white dog and the black dog? The
[1:41:00] Indian chief said there's a war, you
[1:41:02] know, between me and and and the the
[1:41:05] black dog and the white dog are fighting
[1:41:07] AND AND WELL, WHO'S WINNING? The one I
[1:41:09] feed the most.
[1:41:11] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? And I I I promise you,
[1:41:14] amen, THAT THAT THAT YOU CANNOT FULFILL
[1:41:17] THE WILL OF GOD, AMEN, BY FEEDING OFF OF
[1:41:20] YOUTUBE AND FACEBOOK AND INSTAGRAM AND
[1:41:23] AND ALL OF THIS SOCIAL MEDIA AND KEEPING
[1:41:26] UP WITH EVERYTHING THAT'S OUT HERE. I
[1:41:28] PROMISE YOU, YOU CAN'T DO THAT.
[1:41:32] &gt;&gt; YOU HAVE TO SURRENDER YOURSELF TO THE
[1:41:34] WORD OF GOD.
[1:41:37] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:41:37] &gt;&gt; But there has TO BE THAT DESIRE WELL UP
[1:41:40] FOR GOD.
[1:41:41] &gt;&gt; AMEN. AMEN.
[1:41:42] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:41:44] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:41:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:48] &gt;&gt; See, Christ died to destroy to uh uh the
[1:41:52] the eminity to abolish the immity
[1:41:54] between us and him.
[1:41:58] &gt;&gt; Because he can't fulfill his will IN US
[1:42:00] AS LONG AS WE'RE FIGHTING HIM.
[1:42:05] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:42:07] &gt;&gt; I think that's why people walk away from
[1:42:09] the message. They don't want to
[1:42:10] surrender to it. That's true.
[1:42:12] &gt;&gt; That's why preachers start walking away
[1:42:13] from the message teaching their own
[1:42:15] stuff. They can't surrender to it.
[1:42:16] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:42:17] &gt;&gt; This this message isn't an option. This
[1:42:19] this message isn't take it and leave IT
[1:42:21] AND AND DISSECT IT. YOU'VE GOT TO TAKE
[1:42:23] EVERY BIT OF IT OR OR ELSE.
[1:42:26] &gt;&gt; You've got to come to cons complete
[1:42:29] surrender to it.
[1:42:31] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:42:34] &gt;&gt; Bless the Lord. the Lord.
[1:42:36] &gt;&gt; James 4:8 says, "Draw nigh to God, and
[1:42:39] he will draw nigh to you." Is that a
[1:42:41] promise?
[1:42:43] &gt;&gt; Matthew 5:6, "Blessed are they which do
[1:42:45] hunger and thirst after righteousness,
[1:42:47] for they shall be filled." So, you're
[1:42:49] blessed to have that kind of a desire.
[1:42:52] &gt;&gt; You're blessed to see this message as as
[1:42:55] food for the soul. See, changing, it's
[1:42:59] causing a change within us. You believe
[1:43:03] it?
[1:43:05] As I close, when we were children, we
[1:43:08] couldn't discern what was good for us
[1:43:11] and what was not good for us.
[1:43:16] We've all been there.
[1:43:18] &gt;&gt; I don't guess I've ever had any of my
[1:43:20] children, any seven of them, you know,
[1:43:23] had a
[1:43:25] three year old, four year old ask for
[1:43:27] broccoli,
[1:43:29] say, "Can I have some broccoli? That's
[1:43:30] good for me. I'd like to have some." No.
[1:43:34] They want candy
[1:43:36] &gt;&gt; and
[1:43:37] &gt;&gt; oh my
[1:43:37] &gt;&gt; they want sweet things. They want pop.
[1:43:40] They want all kinds of stuff, right?
[1:43:44] &gt;&gt; And then it goes even beyond that, you
[1:43:46] know, they they you know, they would
[1:43:49] want a a fourwheeler, you know, or they
[1:43:51] would want something that maybe they
[1:43:53] couldn't handle, but they just see the
[1:43:56] fun in it and and and and whatever.
[1:43:59] Maybe at a young age, Dad, can I drive
[1:44:01] that car? I' I'd like to go drive it.
[1:44:02] Mm-m. No, you can't drive.
[1:44:05] But it's because our understand the
[1:44:08] understanding
[1:44:10] was was very shallow.
[1:44:13] &gt;&gt; Hadn't matured. Can you say amen?
[1:44:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:16] &gt;&gt; And and so, you know, we we didn't care
[1:44:20] as kids, you know, we didn't discern
[1:44:22] what was bad for us, what was good for
[1:44:24] us. We didn't discern the the hurts that
[1:44:27] could come with things.
[1:44:29] &gt;&gt; I sure didn't. I remember getting up,
[1:44:32] you know, when I was about 16, I guess,
[1:44:34] 15. Got up way up high on a cliff, way
[1:44:38] up high. I don't know how high, but it
[1:44:40] was it's fairly high. And and uh I dove
[1:44:46] in water that would only come up to here
[1:44:47] to my dad.
[1:44:50] &gt;&gt; And and on top of that, I couldn't go
[1:44:53] out that way forward because I'd hit the
[1:44:56] bank. So, I had to jump out and dive
[1:44:59] take a dive that way and and do a real
[1:45:03] shallow dive. I thought that was the
[1:45:05] coolest thing. And my dad, I told dad, I
[1:45:09] said, "Dad, you got to come and look at
[1:45:10] this water. It's so cold. It's It's real
[1:45:13] clear. It's right by a spring." I said,
[1:45:16] "Dad, I got to take you up there, you
[1:45:17] know." And so, we all went as a family.
[1:45:20] And so, I thought I was going to show my
[1:45:22] expertise to my daddy. Oh my.
[1:45:24] &gt;&gt; And uh so I got up there and I said,
[1:45:26] "Dad, watch me dive." What?
[1:45:31] Hold it. You know, you just stay right
[1:45:35] there for a minute. So he walked out
[1:45:36] there and only went to him here. You
[1:45:38] know, he said, "You dive? You you dove
[1:45:41] off that?" I said, "Yeah, all the time."
[1:45:42] He said, "You get down here right now."
[1:45:44] I said, "Oh, dive." No.
[1:45:48] Boy, he gave me a tongue lashing,
[1:45:50] grounded me, and whatever, you know.
[1:45:53] Yeah,
[1:45:54] &gt;&gt; but I didn't know. I just I didn't
[1:45:56] consider the fact that I could be, you
[1:45:59] know, hit my head, break my neck, or
[1:46:01] die.
[1:46:02] &gt;&gt; And and so, you know, that that's just
[1:46:05] the way we were, you know, and and and
[1:46:07] didn't see it. But then we we find that
[1:46:11] as we begin to mature, a change starts
[1:46:15] taking place, not only just in the
[1:46:18] physical, but but also in our
[1:46:20] understanding.
[1:46:22] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[1:46:23] That's right. I'm glad I had parents
[1:46:25] that stayed with me, put up with me,
[1:46:27] taught me the difference between rights
[1:46:29] and wrongs, but yet they couldn't keep
[1:46:32] me from everything. There's a lot of
[1:46:34] experiences, a lot of scars that I have.
[1:46:37] I've learned from experiences.
[1:46:40] BUT BUT ONE THING ABOUT IT, I can truly
[1:46:42] say as a 50-year-old man,
[1:46:46] I definitely wouldn't do what I did back
[1:46:48] then
[1:46:51] &gt;&gt; because I matured, right?
[1:46:54] &gt;&gt; Well, this is what this message is.
[1:46:57] Is to cause us to grow.
[1:46:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:00] &gt;&gt; Change.
[1:47:02] Change. Can you say amen? Not think as a
[1:47:04] Presbyterian. Not think as a
[1:47:06] Pentecostal. not think as a as a
[1:47:09] Lutheran or or or a Wesleyan or whatever
[1:47:12] you want to CALL IT, BUT COME UP TO THE
[1:47:15] PLACE that we're starting to take on the
[1:47:17] mind of Christ.
[1:47:19] &gt;&gt; Having an understanding
[1:47:21] between good and evil, that's true.
[1:47:24] &gt;&gt; Being changed by the word of God. Can
[1:47:27] you say amen?
[1:47:28] &gt;&gt; Do you love him?
[1:47:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:31] uh if the musicians will come.
[1:47:34] We could go on and on, but the desire
[1:47:36] that God created within us causes us to
[1:47:39] groan within us ourselves.
[1:47:44] And I realize that, you know, brother
[1:47:45] Brandham, he said, "When a man receives
[1:47:47] the Holy Spirit, then his time of
[1:47:48] groaning is over because it's a finished
[1:47:50] work." And and and that is true. So,
[1:47:53] we're not groaning to be saved. We're
[1:47:55] not groaning to be sons of God. We're
[1:47:57] not groaning. We've come to a rest. We
[1:48:01] are sons and daughters of God. We have
[1:48:03] his seal. We have his spirit crying aba
[1:48:06] father. But believers are still groaning
[1:48:12] &gt;&gt; because they have a desire. Paul talks
[1:48:15] about it in Romans 8. He says, you know,
[1:48:18] in
[1:48:19] um
[1:48:21] well, we could read it 8:18. For I
[1:48:23] reckon that the sufferings of this
[1:48:25] present time are not worthy to be
[1:48:27] compared with the glory which shall be
[1:48:28] revealed in us.
[1:48:31] See, the sufferings are not worthy to be
[1:48:33] compared with the glory
[1:48:35] &gt;&gt; which shall be revealed in us. For the
[1:48:37] earnest expectation of the creature
[1:48:39] waiteth for the manifestation of the
[1:48:41] sons of God. For the creature was made
[1:48:45] subject to vanity, not willingly, but by
[1:48:48] reason of him who have subjected the
[1:48:50] same in hope. because the creature
[1:48:52] itself also shall be delivered from the
[1:48:55] bondage of corruption into the glorious
[1:48:57] liberty of the children of God. For we
[1:49:00] know that the whole creation groanth and
[1:49:03] travaleth in pain together until now.
[1:49:06] Not only they but ourselves also which
[1:49:08] have the first fruits of the spirit,
[1:49:10] even we ourselves groan within
[1:49:13] ourselves, waiting for the adoption to
[1:49:16] with the redemption of our body. Can you
[1:49:18] say amen?
[1:49:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. talks about groaning again, for in
[1:49:23] this we groan earnestly. Talking about,
[1:49:25] you know, the the earthly house, and if
[1:49:28] it was dissolved, we have a building of
[1:49:30] God, not not made with hands, eternal in
[1:49:33] the heavens. And he said, "For in this
[1:49:34] we grown earnestly desiring to be
[1:49:37] clothed upon with our house which is
[1:49:39] from heaven, if so that being clothed,
[1:49:42] we shall not be found naked, for that we
[1:49:45] are in this tabern. For we that are in
[1:49:48] this tabernacle do groan,
[1:49:51] groaning, groaning, groaning to be
[1:49:54] clothed with immortality,
[1:49:58] groaning to be changed." Can you say
[1:50:00] amen? So our groaning and and I think
[1:50:04] this is the the beauty of it. No matter
[1:50:06] how discouraged we would get or how low
[1:50:09] we would feel, whether we have the
[1:50:11] feelings or not feelings and and high on
[1:50:14] the mountain or NOT HIGH, THERE'S STILL
[1:50:15] THAT DESIRE, a groaning,
[1:50:18] I want to reach it. I got to I got to
[1:50:21] move on. This is not where I am to be.
[1:50:26] I'm to be there
[1:50:27] &gt;&gt; where God has called me to be. Can you
[1:50:30] say amen? It's why brother Brandham said
[1:50:33] nature is groaning. We are groaning.
[1:50:36] Everything is groaning because we
[1:50:38] realize there's something not right. And
[1:50:40] the only way you can groan grown and
[1:50:42] wait for it is because there has been
[1:50:44] new life come in here that speaks of a
[1:50:47] new world.
[1:50:49] I believe this message calls us to
[1:50:51] grown.
[1:50:54] The opening of the word has come. God's
[1:50:57] mind has been revealed,
[1:51:00] showing his desire for the church,
[1:51:02] showing his desire for us in this age,
[1:51:06] and there's something in us causing us
[1:51:08] to grown.
[1:51:10] &gt;&gt; God, I desire for more of you. I I I
[1:51:13] desire. And you know, with that, we we
[1:51:16] just start laying aside this. We start
[1:51:18] laying aside that. Now, church, not
[1:51:20] everybody not everybody just just
[1:51:22] groans. Not everybody just has this
[1:51:25] desire. There's people that just have
[1:51:27] desire and they're content just being
[1:51:29] going to church,
[1:51:31] being mediocre.
[1:51:33] But this bride has a greater desire.
[1:51:35] God, I want more of you.
[1:51:38] &gt;&gt; And the only way we could desire that is
[1:51:40] God placed that within us
[1:51:43] &gt;&gt; because there's something more for us to
[1:51:45] have.
[1:51:46] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:51:48] &gt;&gt; God bless you is our prayer.
[1:51:53] Oh, so great
[1:51:55] of salvation,
[1:51:58] so rich and
[1:52:01] so free.
[1:52:03] I want to thank
[1:52:06] you, Lord,
[1:52:09] for saving
[1:52:11] my soul.
[1:52:13] [Music]
[1:52:15] Thank
[1:52:16] you, Lord,
[1:52:19] for making
[1:52:22] me whole.
[1:52:24] I want to thank
[1:52:27] you, Lord,
[1:52:30] for giving
[1:52:32] to me.
[1:52:35] Oh, thy great salvation
[1:52:40] so rich
[1:52:43] and free. One more time. Oh, thank
[1:52:48] you Lord
[1:52:51] for saving
[1:52:54] my soul.
[1:52:57] Thank
[1:52:59] you Lord
[1:53:02] for making
[1:53:04] me whole.
[1:53:07] Oh, thank
[1:53:10] you Lord
[1:53:12] for giving
[1:53:15] to me
[1:53:17] all thy great salvation
[1:53:22] so rich
[1:53:25] heavy.
[1:53:28] Before we close, there's that old song,
[1:53:30] I surrender all.
[1:53:33] I don't know what key that would be, but
[1:53:37] Oh, I
[1:53:39] surrender
[1:53:42] all.
[1:53:43] [Music]
[1:53:54] All
[1:53:55] to thee, my blessed
[1:54:00] Savior.
[1:54:02] I
[1:54:04] surrender
[1:54:06] all. Sing it again. Yes, I
[1:54:11] surrender
[1:54:13] all.
[1:54:17] [Music]
[1:54:18] I surrender
[1:54:22] all
[1:54:27] to thee my blessed
[1:54:31] Savior
[1:54:33] I
[1:54:35] surrender
[1:54:37] all first verse.
[1:54:40] Oh, all
[1:54:42] to Jesus.
[1:54:45] I surrender
[1:54:49] all
[1:54:50] to him.
[1:54:54] What are we surrendering to? The word,
[1:54:57] the present word, present day truth.
[1:55:03] [Music]
[1:55:05] Hallelujah.
[1:55:07] presence day
[1:55:11] and I
[1:55:13] surrender
[1:55:15] all.
[1:55:19] Oh, I
[1:55:21] [Music]
[1:55:24] surrender all
[1:55:27] all to thee, my
[1:55:32] blessed Savior.
[1:55:35] I surrender
[1:55:39] all.
