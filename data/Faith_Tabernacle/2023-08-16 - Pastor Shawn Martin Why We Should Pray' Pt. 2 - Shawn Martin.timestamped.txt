[43:32] and we're just asking now that you had
[43:34] anoint the service this part Lord anoint
[43:37] myself father and onto people
[43:40] Lord may we just get ourselves out of
[43:43] the way and may you have the preeminence
[43:45] is our prayer
[43:47] we ask it father in Jesus Christ's name
[43:50] amen and amen
[43:53] praise the Lord first Thessalonians the
[43:57] fifth chapter
[43:59] and um
[44:01] in the 17th
[44:04] um
[44:06] verse is just one one verse but it says
[44:09] pray
[44:11] without ceasing
[44:13] amen pray without ceasing and then it
[44:18] will go back to First Timothy I think
[44:22] the
[44:23] the word is important you believe that
[44:26] and
[44:27] um
[44:28] we had read this uh
[44:31] last Wednesday and it's a simple verse
[44:36] but um
[44:38] uh First Timothy
[44:42] um actually the eighth verse is I will
[44:45] therefore that men pray everywhere
[44:48] lifting up holy hands without wrath and
[44:53] doubting
[44:54] amen then one more scripture in First
[44:58] Corinthians the 14th chapter
[45:02] First Corinthians
[45:05] chapter 14.
[45:08] and
[45:09] um
[45:14] the 15th verse
[45:17] it says what is it then
[45:20] I will pray with the spirit
[45:23] and I will pray
[45:25] with the understanding also
[45:29] amen you can have your seats
[45:33] this evening
[45:35] and um
[45:37] I want to use the the title that I'd
[45:42] used last Wednesday and that is why we
[45:44] should pray
[45:46] and uh
[45:48] I uh just a a simple thought I'm not
[45:52] much of a preacher by any means and but
[45:57] uh we pray that the the Lord would just
[46:00] plant the word into our hearts
[46:04] and
[46:05] um but I I think Satan
[46:09] I think he fights us all uh on on our
[46:12] prayer life
[46:13] and that seems to be a a common battle I
[46:18] think
[46:19] um if if we would all
[46:22] um
[46:23] look at it uh uh Satan fights us and and
[46:26] they're just times
[46:28] uh that it isn't just the easiest thing
[46:31] to do and that is to get down and and
[46:34] pray and and you know we we come up with
[46:38] all kinds of excuses as to why you know
[46:41] we don't pray and and you know I I think
[46:45] our our excuses has has us believing
[46:49] that we can't pray or that we ain't got
[46:52] time to pray or uh and and and these
[46:56] things but uh to be honest I I it's
[47:00] Satan is the one that supplies us with
[47:02] these these kinds of excuses
[47:04] uh because uh I don't I don't think God
[47:08] uh would make the day too short to where
[47:11] we couldn't pray if he wants us to pray
[47:13] and so apparently he thinks 24 hours in
[47:17] a day is pretty adequate enough to find
[47:19] time to pray on a daily basis and and so
[47:24] uh but there is a reason as to why Satan
[47:27] uh fights Us in in this way in in our
[47:31] prayer and and again
[47:34] um brother Branham mentions it several
[47:36] times but in one place he said prayer is
[47:40] the greatest weapon uh in the world and
[47:44] and and and so
[47:46] um you know we we read about different
[47:48] characters uh in the Bible and how they
[47:52] had something to defeat the enemy with
[47:54] and
[47:56] um whether you know it was uh uh a
[48:01] slingshot
[48:02] um or whether it was just uh uh you know
[48:06] an ox gold or uh what whatever it would
[48:09] would be but these stories aren't
[48:12] fictitious they ain't something that we
[48:15] just use for a bedtime story but but
[48:18] they they are a reality and and they are
[48:22] to give us hope that if if they had
[48:27] something if a natural Seed of Abraham
[48:29] could take a natural weapon under the
[48:33] spirit of God and and defeat uh the
[48:37] enemy with whether it being a lion or
[48:39] whether it was one man against 600
[48:42] soldiers or whether it was the you know
[48:45] just a choir out there singing and the
[48:48] enemy uh Was Defeated or or whatever it
[48:51] was amen then then it would give us or
[48:55] it should give us as the Royal Seed of
[48:58] Abraham uh a courage to know that God
[49:01] has given us something to defeat the end
[49:04] enemy with ain't that right and and you
[49:08] know we we look at at Satan or at Samson
[49:12] and and Samson just just a common man
[49:16] and yet we we uh when the lion come at
[49:19] him uh he would just rip the Jaws apart
[49:22] and uh when the Philistines came at him
[49:26] he defeated a thousand Philistines I
[49:29] believe and and it was just a story
[49:31] after story of the supernatural upon
[49:34] that man and and and we find that the
[49:37] the the secret to Samson's strength was
[49:40] not in his muscular power but in his uh
[49:44] the physical but it was his hair uh it
[49:48] was a Nazarite uh that uh a vowel and it
[49:52] was his long hair and nothing could
[49:55] conquer him nothing could imprison him
[49:58] nothing could hinder him and you know
[50:01] you read where the Bible says that they
[50:03] would put ropes around him and and try
[50:06] to bind him and he would just break him
[50:08] and there was a power that that the the
[50:12] the the the
[50:13] Nations and the enemy did not know where
[50:17] he was getting this from y'all's brother
[50:19] Brandon tells us that he was just a
[50:21] little mama's boy skinny little
[50:24] kid and and yet there was a hidden power
[50:28] and that was in his hair but when the
[50:31] enemy cut off his hair then Samson was
[50:35] just like any Normal Man and the enemy
[50:38] was able to make a slave out of him and
[50:41] put his eyes out and and you know the
[50:43] story well the prophet in talking of
[50:47] Samson's string then he begins to talk
[50:50] of the the the church's strength and
[50:52] that is a prayer life he said that that
[50:56] the the secret to the church's strength
[50:58] uh is is the prayer life and if the
[51:02] enemy is able to take our prayer life
[51:05] away then we become no different than
[51:08] the rest of the religious World ain't
[51:10] that right now brother Branham says I
[51:13] can almost point you to a church like
[51:15] that helpless defeated blind rejecting
[51:18] the promises rejecting the word a church
[51:21] that Christ promised that would have
[51:24] power over sickness for he says in my
[51:27] name they shall cast out Devils taken up
[51:29] a devil and casting him away and the
[51:32] blessings that he promised his church
[51:34] and because the church has turned from
[51:38] prayer meetings and from sincerity and
[51:41] made the religion of Christ a tradition
[51:44] and has took all the strength out of it
[51:46] glamor has come into our churches and
[51:49] she stands just about defeated can you
[51:53] imagine that look at David when he
[51:57] defeated Goliath with that slingshot and
[52:00] and uh what what a thing that was David
[52:03] just a little boy but that he was an
[52:05] anointed and he had something in his
[52:08] hand a man to fight that that Goliath
[52:11] with and it wasn't anything that the
[52:13] world would have would have picked amen
[52:15] but but God was with David and David
[52:18] knew uh uh uh how to use that sling
[52:22] ain't that right well the prophet like
[52:24] him the slingshot to David as what
[52:27] prayer is to the church and and so uh uh
[52:31] he said you've got the greatest weapon
[52:33] in the world in your hands and that is
[52:37] prayer can you say Amen see so God did
[52:40] not leave us here in this layout of sin
[52:42] age uh to be defeated amen we're living
[52:46] in an age where where the enemy is
[52:48] coming like an onslaught it's it's the
[52:51] demons are pouring out from everywhere
[52:53] and it's invading the homes the schools
[52:56] the Nations the world the churches it's
[52:59] it's it's ruining uh uh marriages and
[53:02] the people's minds are so twisted and
[53:05] all of that and yet God in this age says
[53:08] he will have a church without spot
[53:10] wrinkle or blemish and there's got to be
[53:13] a reason why he gave us a weapon a man
[53:15] to defeat the enemy with and that is by
[53:18] prayer amen first Peter 3 and 12 it says
[53:22] for the eyes of the Lord are over the
[53:25] righteous and his ears are open unto
[53:29] their prayers not their complaints not
[53:31] their gripes not the grumblings but
[53:34] their prayer can you say amen amen see
[53:37] and so it's it's through prayer that the
[53:40] lame has walked it's been through prayer
[53:42] that the blind is seen the dead has been
[53:45] raised the crippled have walked the
[53:47] death here it's been through prayer that
[53:50] the sinner has been saved the drug
[53:53] addict uh delivered and and on and on
[53:57] and on you think of today how did we get
[54:00] here tonight amen it's because somebody
[54:02] prayed for us amen whether it was a mama
[54:06] and a daddy or a grandmother or a
[54:08] grandfather or the preacher or just a a
[54:12] Godly saint that spent time on their
[54:15] knees in prayer for us amen but there
[54:17] there was somebody praying amen it
[54:20] wasn't just a magic wand A man that was
[54:23] just waved over us but somebody was
[54:25] praying somebody took us a man on their
[54:29] hearts and and began to pray the Bible
[54:32] says the fervent prayer of a righteous
[54:35] man availeth much a man a James 5 15 it
[54:40] says the prayer of faith shall save the
[54:42] sick do you believe that amen and that's
[54:45] just not talking of physically but that
[54:47] is Also spiritually whatever you have
[54:50] need of the prayer of faith will save
[54:53] you the prayer of faith will deliver you
[54:56] amen you see the prophet said when the
[54:58] weakest of saints fall on their knees in
[55:02] prayer even the devil's tremble they
[55:05] don't tremble at your your your your
[55:07] scholarship they don't tremble because
[55:10] you can put fancy words together they
[55:12] don't tremble because you can run around
[55:14] the church and roll on the floor and
[55:17] speak in tongues and and all of that
[55:19] that don't what make them tremble but
[55:21] when you get a weakest Christian on
[55:24] their knees and begin to pray the devil
[55:27] begins to tremble amen and no wonder he
[55:31] fights us so hard amen because it's it's
[55:35] it's a weapon that God has given you and
[55:38] I amen do you believe that amen we we
[55:42] think of word word word and I'm glad for
[55:44] the word I appreciate the word the word
[55:46] is powerful but the word without prayer
[55:48] Ain't Nothing To Us you've got to put
[55:50] that word to practice and that is by
[55:53] prayer amen the prophet said what a
[55:56] power and a privilege has been given to
[55:58] the Church of the Living God not only a
[56:01] power has been given to us by prayer but
[56:04] it's been a privilege that's been given
[56:06] to us to be able to pray unto our father
[56:10] Amen brother Branham says the backbone
[56:12] of this nation is good old mothers and
[56:15] dads at the prayer meeting on their
[56:17] knees praying amen that's what makes a a
[56:20] nation is when you get people no wonder
[56:23] he's got us into sports and and movies
[56:26] and he's got us in in all kinds of
[56:28] programs and all of that he's got us
[56:31] distracted from the real thing and that
[56:33] is prayer can you say Amen when Mom and
[56:36] Dad ceases to pray the Devil comes in
[56:39] and he can he can do anything because
[56:41] there's nothing to keep him at Bay when
[56:44] the church ceases to pray when the
[56:46] nation ceases to pray amen when the
[56:48] individual ceases to pray can you say
[56:51] amen amen you can know the Bible you can
[56:53] know the message you can know it all but
[56:55] if you ain't got a prayer life
[56:58] that's the weapon against the devil
[57:02] amen second chronicles 7 14 If my people
[57:06] which are called by my name notice that
[57:09] my people a man which are called by my
[57:12] name shall humble themselves and pray
[57:13] and seek my face and turn from their
[57:16] Wicked Ways then will I hear from heaven
[57:18] and will forgive their sin and will heal
[57:20] their land do you understand that that's
[57:22] not all America that's not the whole
[57:24] world but if my people which are called
[57:27] by my name ain't that right when you
[57:29] begin to pray and and when there's
[57:31] things that are in your life that you
[57:33] know that that you've done wrong you
[57:36] made your mistakes and and all that get
[57:38] on your knees and pray amen because
[57:41] there's a God that is waiting to hear
[57:43] your prayer amen and to answer them do
[57:47] you believe that amen see uh uh that's
[57:50] right Amen brother Brown said we would
[57:53] have less juvenile delinquency if
[57:55] mothers and fathers spent more time on
[57:57] their knees praying bringing their
[57:59] children to God through prayer instead
[58:01] of out in these parties drinking and
[58:03] running around amen uh we we all know
[58:06] the the story of Job what a father he
[58:09] was a Godly father a man that knew what
[58:13] it was to pray amen and he was a man
[58:16] that prayed for his children even after
[58:18] even after his children were married and
[58:21] gone on a man with her own lives amen
[58:25] job as a father kept that kept his
[58:28] children amen before the Lord and the
[58:31] prophet said he knew what path to turn
[58:33] to when he got in trouble he said some
[58:36] of us go other paths in this neurotic
[58:38] age that we're living in so many people
[58:40] turn uh to the psychiatrists Christians
[58:44] go to the psychiatrist the psychiatrist
[58:46] has to go to the psychiatrist and
[58:48] everything amen but someone's forgetting
[58:51] to pray job didn't go to the
[58:53] psychiatrist he didn't go to the uh to
[58:55] the counselors he didn't go looking for
[58:58] professional help he got on his knees
[59:00] and he began to pray ain't that right
[59:03] prayer amen so we we see Amen brother
[59:08] Adam said you want God to send the power
[59:10] upon you go to pray and then believe it
[59:13] the Holy Ghost will bring it to you
[59:15] bring healing bring Salvation or
[59:18] whatever everybody say whatever whatever
[59:21] you have need of God will bring it to
[59:25] you now that's a promise do you believe
[59:28] that that is a that is that's thus saith
[59:31] the Lord that is a promise that whatever
[59:33] you have need of go to praying
[59:38] praise the Lord yes sir
[59:40] why does God allow situations to come in
[59:44] our life
[59:46] it's because God has placed confidence
[59:49] in US
[59:50] that we would be able to pray the prayer
[59:53] of faith
[59:55] you think of that that we would be able
[59:59] to pray the prayer of faith you see
[1:00:02] God's not God's not oblivious of our
[1:00:05] troubles
[1:00:06] God God is not our you know we're not
[1:00:10] hid from God
[1:00:12] but but if if you look at it on God's
[1:00:15] end he's got confidence in you
[1:00:19] ain't ain't that right there's other
[1:00:21] people that are turning away there's
[1:00:22] other people living half mediocre lives
[1:00:25] and lukewarm lives but then but then
[1:00:28] there are people that are living true
[1:00:30] lives and yet you've got your troubles
[1:00:32] and it's not because God don't love you
[1:00:34] it's not because God is forsaken you
[1:00:37] it's actually the prophet said God has
[1:00:39] placed confidence in US
[1:00:41] God's Place confidence in US knowing
[1:00:44] that we're able we're able to pray the
[1:00:47] prayer of faith
[1:00:49] can you say amen amen see and so he says
[1:00:53] here any believer he says any believer
[1:00:56] that's got this Holy Spirit you have the
[1:00:59] power of God within you or the authority
[1:01:02] to pray the prayer of faith
[1:01:05] ain't that right so so the Holy Ghost it
[1:01:08] wasn't given you to excite you it that
[1:01:11] that comes with it I'm sure it wasn't
[1:01:13] given you to to roll on the floor and do
[1:01:16] flip-flops and you you may do that I
[1:01:19] don't know but one thing it does give
[1:01:21] you is the authority to pray the prayer
[1:01:23] of faith amen we all need to pray can
[1:01:26] you say Amen you don't leave it to the
[1:01:29] preacher to do all your praying you
[1:01:30] don't leave it to Mom and Dad to do all
[1:01:32] your praying you don't leave it to
[1:01:34] everybody else to do all you you got
[1:01:36] your troubles that you get on your knees
[1:01:38] and you pray the prayer of faith and
[1:01:40] what's your troubles go away can you say
[1:01:43] amen and that's the relationship that
[1:01:46] God wants us to have now it's there's
[1:01:48] nothing wrong with praying for one
[1:01:50] another we need one another and that's
[1:01:52] all part of it amen but but don't don't
[1:01:54] don't think that we can just go and live
[1:01:57] in a a a carnal life and let everybody
[1:02:00] do our praying for us amen that's what
[1:02:02] the Catholics was doing you know that it
[1:02:04] was the priest that was holy the people
[1:02:06] just done whatever they want to and they
[1:02:08] would take care of it all amen but the
[1:02:10] prophet said that ain't the way it is
[1:02:11] the preacher's got to be holy the Saints
[1:02:13] have got to be holy the preacher's got
[1:02:15] to do is praying the Saints have got to
[1:02:17] do their praying can you say amen and
[1:02:19] sometimes you young people got to do
[1:02:21] your own praying
[1:02:22] [Applause]
[1:02:24] [Music]
[1:02:27] so why why doesn't God just
[1:02:30] automatically give what we need
[1:02:33] if if he knows we're having need
[1:02:37] and and and
[1:02:38] sometimes he allows these things to
[1:02:41] linger
[1:02:42] and it just seems like he just don't
[1:02:45] know
[1:02:46] and and and so automatically we wonder
[1:02:49] God where are you
[1:02:51] so why now now I'm I'm here to assure
[1:02:54] you he knows exactly where you're at
[1:02:57] he knows your troubles
[1:02:59] he knows what ails you whether it's
[1:03:01] physically spiritually mentally he knows
[1:03:05] but see what what it is is the prophet
[1:03:08] said the kingdom of God lays within the
[1:03:11] human being hey ain't that right Jesus
[1:03:15] said I'm Divine and you are the branches
[1:03:17] and and brother Brown said see the the
[1:03:19] vine cannot bear the fruit only the
[1:03:22] branches
[1:03:23] ain't that right see the vine cannot
[1:03:26] bear the fruit only the branches God
[1:03:28] cannot bear fruit of himself it's got to
[1:03:31] take the church
[1:03:34] so when you branches he says are yielded
[1:03:37] to the vine then the fruit comes forth
[1:03:39] see what I mean God wants your hands he
[1:03:42] wants your eyes he wants your tongue he
[1:03:45] wants your lips he wants your ears he
[1:03:46] wants your hands and feet so he can
[1:03:49] bring forth fruit through you
[1:03:52] we've read the quotes before where
[1:03:54] brother Branham amen talk to how God
[1:03:57] decided to live inside of you so he
[1:03:59] could defeat his own enemy in you
[1:04:02] he gonna take your body and defeat his
[1:04:04] enemy
[1:04:05] ain't that right so he wants to take you
[1:04:08] and believe through you he wants to pray
[1:04:10] through you he wants to speak through
[1:04:12] you he wants them mountains to move
[1:04:14] through your lips
[1:04:18] that's why Jesus says if you abide in me
[1:04:21] and my words abide in you
[1:04:23] you shall ask what you will you shall
[1:04:25] ask everybody say I shall ask
[1:04:27] I shall ask
[1:04:30] you shall ask what you will and it shall
[1:04:32] be done unto you if you say unto this
[1:04:34] mountain be thou removed and be thou
[1:04:36] cast into the sea amen and shall not
[1:04:39] doubt in your heart but shall believe
[1:04:41] that those things which you say a man
[1:04:44] shall come to pass you shall have
[1:04:46] whatsoever you say Do you believe that
[1:04:50] well if we're going to speak to our
[1:04:52] Mountain then there has to be a mountain
[1:04:54] standing in our way
[1:04:57] and I don't care what kind of a mountain
[1:04:59] it is if it's a mountain it's something
[1:05:01] that you don't know what you're going to
[1:05:03] do about you don't know how you're going
[1:05:05] to get over that mountain it's there
[1:05:07] standing in your way to prevent you from
[1:05:09] moving on Amen and that's the mountain
[1:05:11] that Jesus said if you speak to that
[1:05:13] mountain ain't that right amen he ain't
[1:05:16] going to do your speaking for you so
[1:05:18] this mountain before you is not an
[1:05:21] imaginary your problem amen is not
[1:05:24] imaginary it's not something that is
[1:05:26] fictitious it is real but God wants it
[1:05:29] to be real we're not playing games here
[1:05:32] the enemy is real but your Victory is
[1:05:34] real and his defeat is real
[1:05:37] do you believe that amen see so only a
[1:05:42] Son of God has the authority to speak
[1:05:44] to the mountain
[1:05:46] notice Jesus says another place
[1:05:48] whatsoever things you desire
[1:05:50] think of it whatsoever things you desire
[1:05:56] When you pray believe that you receive
[1:05:59] them
[1:06:00] can you say Amen so I'll say that again
[1:06:03] whatsoever things you desire if you pray
[1:06:09] he didn't say that did he
[1:06:11] he said when you pray
[1:06:14] you can sit there and quit you know I
[1:06:16] just wished I just wish how many times
[1:06:18] have you prayed
[1:06:20] it's not if you pray
[1:06:22] but when you pray
[1:06:25] can you say Amen so so then that that's
[1:06:28] obvious that we are going to be a people
[1:06:30] of Prayer
[1:06:34] so what's whatsoever things you desire
[1:06:37] When you pray believe that you receive
[1:06:39] them and you shall have them
[1:06:44] so he's not teaching you how to cope
[1:06:48] if if you want to cope how to be an
[1:06:50] alcoholic and and cope with that go to
[1:06:53] the AAA
[1:06:54] if if you if you want to learn how to
[1:06:57] cope with things in life there's all
[1:06:58] kinds of programs but the gospel doesn't
[1:07:01] teach you how to cope
[1:07:02] [Applause]
[1:07:04] can you say man the kingdom of God lays
[1:07:08] within you
[1:07:09] so so then we find that prayer has value
[1:07:12] it is valuable and and and you don't
[1:07:16] treat something that is valuable as
[1:07:18] though it is worthless and no good you
[1:07:21] you you if you don't see the value in it
[1:07:24] you're going to cast it off
[1:07:27] yeah true
[1:07:29] I um I remember my my uncle
[1:07:34] my mom's side
[1:07:36] um he had him and his wife it was
[1:07:38] actually his wife's uh mother had passed
[1:07:41] away and so they inherited a lot of
[1:07:44] things and and a lot of antiques that he
[1:07:46] had no clue about value
[1:07:49] and so he didn't see value he saw it as
[1:07:52] junk
[1:07:53] and so I began to sell these things and
[1:07:55] he sold something for five dollars to my
[1:07:57] aunts you know and she went and sold it
[1:07:59] for a thousand and you know it is
[1:08:01] because he didn't see value he just
[1:08:04] wanted it out of his way and so many
[1:08:06] times we treat prayers the same way it
[1:08:08] becomes burdensome to us when we don't
[1:08:11] realize it's your very ticket amen it's
[1:08:15] your very thing that you whatever you
[1:08:17] pray whatever when you pray whatever you
[1:08:19] desire you shall have but you've got to
[1:08:22] pray ain't that right prayer is so
[1:08:25] important it it's not it's not you know
[1:08:28] when you start complaining you'll have
[1:08:30] it or or when you start grumbling you'll
[1:08:32] have it or when you start worrying about
[1:08:34] it you'll have it or when you don't know
[1:08:36] what to do that's when you're going to
[1:08:38] get it no it's when you pray believing
[1:08:42] that whatever you say you shall have
[1:08:45] [Music]
[1:08:47] ain't that right so so there's power in
[1:08:51] prayer Dayton here's what the prophet
[1:08:53] said and I I thought it was profound he
[1:08:56] said you take the world and their way of
[1:08:58] life and then take a people who pray and
[1:09:01] see who gets better results
[1:09:04] right and and and this is exactly what
[1:09:07] Elijah did he he he of course you you
[1:09:11] know the story the whole nation almost
[1:09:13] the whole nation uh uh had had went
[1:09:16] toward bail to idolatry
[1:09:18] and and so God sent a Prophet Elijah to
[1:09:22] bring it all down to a showdown to see
[1:09:24] who was God
[1:09:25] and so instead of saying you know God is
[1:09:27] God God is God he says you know what
[1:09:29] let's bring this to a showdown let's
[1:09:31] prove who's God all right you 400 prop
[1:09:34] to Ahab you get your your prophets and
[1:09:36] your preachers and all that and and and
[1:09:38] you you build your altars first you do
[1:09:41] whatever you think you got to do and
[1:09:43] let's see the god that answers by fire
[1:09:45] let him let him come and that's the one
[1:09:47] we're going to serve ain't that right
[1:09:48] and and so they that so he allowed them
[1:09:51] to pray to their God he made fun of them
[1:09:53] and they ain't get nowhere and and and
[1:09:55] so then he began to pray unto his God
[1:09:59] Amen and and and we find amen that the
[1:10:02] God answered by fire ain't that right
[1:10:05] well brother Branham spoke to an
[1:10:07] audience in in Kentucky uh Louisville
[1:10:10] Kentucky who was gathered there for
[1:10:12] prayer there must have been a big
[1:10:14] drought it was in the 50s and and so uh
[1:10:17] they had all come together for prayer
[1:10:19] and so they invited him to uh to to
[1:10:22] speak uh for for a few moments and so he
[1:10:25] he told them this he he said you you
[1:10:28] have a beer party down here to start
[1:10:31] your gaiety or have a big picnic
[1:10:33] somewhere and let the whole world turn
[1:10:35] into that and bring rain on the earth
[1:10:37] amen so so this now this is just the
[1:10:40] serious thing because everybody you know
[1:10:42] well God ain't answering God ain't this
[1:10:44] and God ain't that well let's just bring
[1:10:45] it to a showdown then if the world says
[1:10:48] that their God is right then let's do it
[1:10:50] let's ever let the whole world turn to
[1:10:52] sports let them turn into movies let
[1:10:55] them turn to their actors let them turn
[1:10:56] to all the gods of this world and see
[1:10:58] what God of God their God can do for us
[1:11:02] hey can you say amen that's right see he
[1:11:05] said see let's try that tonight you just
[1:11:07] open up every Saloon give everybody all
[1:11:09] the drinks they can and make the
[1:11:11] Christians stay home and not pray and
[1:11:13] everything like that and see if you can
[1:11:15] bring rain and prosperity to the nation
[1:11:17] he said but then you close them every
[1:11:20] one all the bars all the saloons and and
[1:11:22] everything else stop all your meanness
[1:11:25] and everything and get down on your
[1:11:27] knees and call out to God and watch what
[1:11:29] happens and let the god the answers let
[1:11:31] him be God can you say Amen let him be
[1:11:35] God see amen he said let's do a trial he
[1:11:38] said I've seen that tried many times I
[1:11:41] said you get one of the persons let's
[1:11:42] bring the sick and Afflicted and find
[1:11:44] out who's God God will be the same thing
[1:11:47] in this see amen he says if you people
[1:11:51] around this area here one an
[1:11:52] old-fashioned pouring down rain you just
[1:11:55] get down on your knees and all of you
[1:11:56] start around here start calling out to
[1:11:59] God with the sincere heart burn up
[1:12:01] everything in your house amen and uh uh
[1:12:05] he says uh take that that beer bottles
[1:12:08] out of the ice ice box and throw away
[1:12:10] that deck of cards and take the children
[1:12:12] and take them off to Sunday school and
[1:12:15] stay in prayer instead of running out
[1:12:17] and running around and getting all about
[1:12:19] the way you do get on your knees and
[1:12:21] start praying and God will send you the
[1:12:23] rain don't do you believe that well I
[1:12:26] believe that's the same thing because I
[1:12:28] I tell you what God did not God did not
[1:12:31] call us out of the world just for us
[1:12:34] just to not know who God really is and
[1:12:37] and for him to remain silent and him to
[1:12:39] amen just to remain hidden from us God
[1:12:42] answers prayer and he will answer your
[1:12:45] prayer if you'll pray to him
[1:12:48] yes sir
[1:12:49] I believe that
[1:12:51] you believe that
[1:12:54] he called you out of unbelief he called
[1:12:56] you out of the mutton sin of the world
[1:13:00] to show his power through you
[1:13:02] and to you
[1:13:05] so I believe that God is bringing this
[1:13:07] to a showdown
[1:13:08] you believe that
[1:13:09] I I do and and and people are choosing
[1:13:13] as to what side they are on the
[1:13:16] nominations keep saying they have the
[1:13:18] answer we say the word of God has that
[1:13:20] how many knows the word of God has the
[1:13:21] answer you know the word of God has the
[1:13:24] answer it's true don't lie you believe
[1:13:25] that and don't lie say he he doesn't lie
[1:13:28] amen well the religious World they they
[1:13:31] say they have the authority well we say
[1:13:33] the sons of God have the authority do
[1:13:36] you believe you got the authority now if
[1:13:38] we're sons of God now everybody raise
[1:13:39] their hands on on the Bible now do you
[1:13:41] believe you have the authority amen if
[1:13:44] the Bible is true he says you've got the
[1:13:45] authority so we've got to raise our
[1:13:46] hands on that one too amen that's right
[1:13:49] see so we say the sons of God have the
[1:13:52] authority well then now now church we
[1:13:55] know we know that God has answered by
[1:13:58] fire in this day do you believe that God
[1:14:00] has answered by fire in this day and the
[1:14:03] god of theology the god of psychology
[1:14:06] the God of this world has been exposed
[1:14:08] for what it is it's nothing it's a bluff
[1:14:11] it's it's powerless it's it's everything
[1:14:14] that that that that that it says it's
[1:14:16] not amen it's just a flat liar amen all
[1:14:20] the gods are powerless amen but now I'm
[1:14:22] talking about you and your personal
[1:14:24] experience and your personal crisis you
[1:14:27] see the world says that it's the God of
[1:14:29] Pleasure that will help your children
[1:14:31] but I say to you the god of Israel will
[1:14:33] help your children do you believe that
[1:14:36] the world says the god of science is the
[1:14:38] answer for your sickness but I say to
[1:14:40] you Jehovah God Is The Answer amen
[1:14:43] hospitals ain't the answer God Is The
[1:14:45] Answer medication ain't the answer God
[1:14:48] is the answer I understand that God
[1:14:50] works through medication and we we
[1:14:52] believe in that stuff amen that we don't
[1:14:54] get to the point that we forsake God and
[1:14:56] think that the doctor has our answers
[1:14:58] and then all of a sudden he says well
[1:15:00] there ain't no more hope for you than we
[1:15:01] just fall apart if he don't know what to
[1:15:04] do and he can't fix us there's a God
[1:15:06] that's still known let him answer by
[1:15:09] fire
[1:15:10] then you say Amen see you got to bring
[1:15:13] it to a showdown don't be afraid to
[1:15:15] bring God to a showdown the prophet said
[1:15:17] amen amen that's right don't let the
[1:15:20] devil back you up don't let the devil
[1:15:22] intimidate you you say but you don't
[1:15:24] understand the crisis that I am I don't
[1:15:26] care it's still God he's God over
[1:15:28] everything he's got over every name
[1:15:31] whatever your face and he's God
[1:15:34] and you've got the weapon in your hands
[1:15:37] to defeat him that devil and that's by
[1:15:40] prayer
[1:15:42] the prophet said see don't be afraid to
[1:15:44] bring to put God to a showdown he's
[1:15:46] great in battle
[1:15:49] do you believe that he's great in battle
[1:15:54] now our enemy of course is not a natural
[1:15:56] enemy
[1:15:57] Ephesians 6 12
[1:15:59] Paul says we wrestle not against flesh
[1:16:02] and blood but against the principalities
[1:16:04] against Powers against the rulers of the
[1:16:07] darkness of this world against spiritual
[1:16:09] wickedness in high places so see our
[1:16:12] fight is a different fight amen we're
[1:16:15] not wrestling against human beings we're
[1:16:17] not wrestling against the government
[1:16:18] we're not wrestling against a nation
[1:16:20] amen that's not our warfare that's not
[1:16:23] our fight let the politicians let
[1:16:25] everybody else do that that's their
[1:16:26] fight the fat ain't our fight we're not
[1:16:29] wrestling against flesh of blood so we
[1:16:31] handle it differently can you say Amen
[1:16:34] our weapon is different amen see so what
[1:16:37] do we do amen we go to our knees and
[1:16:41] prayer and pray through till we get the
[1:16:44] victory
[1:16:49] that shouldn't be foreign to us
[1:16:52] that's what the prophet said we pray
[1:16:54] through till we get victory
[1:16:56] victory victory is yours brother Bill
[1:16:58] victory's mine but we got to get pray
[1:17:01] and pray through pray through get down
[1:17:03] there and pray through until we get to
[1:17:06] Victory
[1:17:07] don't act as God ain't for us God is for
[1:17:10] you he's already told you in his word
[1:17:11] he's for you what else can he do for us
[1:17:15] oh God is for us until we go through
[1:17:17] battles God loves us until we go through
[1:17:19] things and we think God doesn't love and
[1:17:21] then that's when we start questioning it
[1:17:24] but if his word is true and if we're
[1:17:26] sons of God then we've got the answer
[1:17:28] already we don't have to wait for God to
[1:17:30] give answers we've got that answer pray
[1:17:32] through until you get victory
[1:17:40] Hallelujah
[1:17:41] when a sick person prays through
[1:17:44] to where he knows
[1:17:46] that it's God's will for him to be
[1:17:47] healed
[1:17:49] that's what brother Graham said
[1:17:51] pray through
[1:17:53] and tell you no
[1:17:55] tell you no
[1:17:57] ain't that right
[1:17:59] now the prophet says when that person
[1:18:01] does pray through
[1:18:02] notice what he says he said there's no
[1:18:05] need for a minister to pray for that
[1:18:06] individual
[1:18:07] all the minister has to do is lay hands
[1:18:09] on him and cast that devil off because
[1:18:12] that saint of God has already prayed
[1:18:14] through
[1:18:15] he already knows healing is for him
[1:18:18] so it doesn't take the prayer of a
[1:18:20] Preacher to pray no he's already done
[1:18:22] the praying through he's already got the
[1:18:24] victory he's already knows he's already
[1:18:26] come through it that it's God's will for
[1:18:27] him to be healed now we just cast that
[1:18:29] devil off
[1:18:31] then you say Amen that that's exactly
[1:18:33] right see he said see you pray until we
[1:18:37] go beyond the sound barrier of sin and
[1:18:39] unbelief brother Branham called it
[1:18:42] praying through to Victory
[1:18:44] go pray until you get past that same
[1:18:47] barrier of unbelief pray until you get
[1:18:50] past that sound barrier of skepticism
[1:18:53] and doubt and worrying and and
[1:18:55] questioning amen pray through until you
[1:18:58] get to victory that you know that God is
[1:19:01] going to answer and you know that your
[1:19:03] prayer has been heard and that victory
[1:19:05] is yours and and that everything that
[1:19:07] you have longed for the desires of your
[1:19:10] heart has now been given unto you
[1:19:12] it's prayer
[1:19:15] hope is all right
[1:19:17] prayer
[1:19:19] Hebrews 4 16 Paul said let us therefore
[1:19:23] come boldly unto the throne of grace
[1:19:26] that we may obtain mercy and find Grace
[1:19:28] in time to help in time of need
[1:19:32] see so how do we come before the Throne
[1:19:34] of God grace by prayer when you come
[1:19:38] into prayer see and and while while
[1:19:42] praying the prophet said we look to the
[1:19:45] throne of God with confidence
[1:19:47] so this is where your prayers got to
[1:19:49] have confidence you got to be confident
[1:19:51] in prayer
[1:19:53] not I'm going to try it and see if it'll
[1:19:55] work out that ain't confident you're not
[1:19:58] looking at God and confident but when
[1:19:59] you come to pray amen and you're coming
[1:20:02] Before the Throne of God that throne of
[1:20:04] grace amen you come boldly you come
[1:20:06] confidently that whatever you say to God
[1:20:08] he's going to hear your prayer amen and
[1:20:11] he's going to answer them prayers can
[1:20:13] you say Amen now amen and seat now there
[1:20:15] is a reason there is a reason that you
[1:20:18] must have this confidence uh uh and and
[1:20:21] this is again in the natural sense uh
[1:20:23] but first Kings 8 and 30 tells us of the
[1:20:26] prayer that Solomon uh prayed as he
[1:20:29] dedicated the temple and he said Lord
[1:20:31] God of Israel hearken thou to the
[1:20:34] supplication of thy servant and of thy
[1:20:36] people when they shall pray toward this
[1:20:39] place in other words when they pray look
[1:20:41] into this place amen that and hear thou
[1:20:45] in heaven thy dwelling place and when
[1:20:48] thou hearest to forgive ain't that right
[1:20:51] so remember when they pray looking
[1:20:54] toward this this place the temple then
[1:20:57] hear from heaven now that prayer now you
[1:21:00] think of that prayer he's just praying
[1:21:02] to God that they that anyone that would
[1:21:04] that is away from from the place if they
[1:21:06] would just when they pray look to the
[1:21:08] temple amen that you would hear their
[1:21:10] prayer well here years later here's a
[1:21:13] prophet Jonah he got himself in trouble
[1:21:15] ain't that right amen and he finds
[1:21:17] himself down in the depths of the ocean
[1:21:19] in the whale's belly the prophet said
[1:21:22] there's no man that has had a situation
[1:21:24] like Jonah he was in a he was in a
[1:21:26] horrible condition but he remembered the
[1:21:29] prayer of Solomon amen he just didn't
[1:21:32] look and say well then we're just words
[1:21:33] of a man no no no no he believed in
[1:21:36] prayer he knew the quality of prayer and
[1:21:39] he knew that if that man prayed God
[1:21:41] heard it
[1:21:43] can you say Amen the prophet said it was
[1:21:45] a prayer of a prophet
[1:21:47] and he began to pray amen Solomon
[1:21:50] remember or Jonah remembered it see in
[1:21:52] that condition and he believed that
[1:21:54] Jonah uh two and one says then Jonah
[1:21:57] prayed unto the Lord is God out of the
[1:21:59] fish's belly and said I cried by reason
[1:22:02] of my Affliction unto the Lord and he
[1:22:04] heard me out of the belly of Hell cried
[1:22:07] I and thou hurtest my voice for thou had
[1:22:10] has cast me into the deep in the midst
[1:22:13] of the Seas and the floods compassed
[1:22:16] about me amen all by Billows and thy
[1:22:18] waves passed over me then said I I am
[1:22:22] cast out of thy sight what a what a
[1:22:25] condition Jonah was in yet I will look
[1:22:28] again toward thy Holy Temple amen he was
[1:22:32] basing his actions off of the prayer of
[1:22:35] a man that had backslid
[1:22:37] can you say amen that's right see he and
[1:22:41] and the temple amen it was built by a
[1:22:44] man a man all it was nothing Eternal he
[1:22:47] was it was destroyed eventually down
[1:22:50] down the years amen but the prophet said
[1:22:53] if Jonah could do that look to a natural
[1:22:56] Temple amen because of a prayer of a man
[1:22:59] that had later on backslid but Jonah
[1:23:02] believed in prayer and he he put that he
[1:23:05] started to look to that Temple he
[1:23:07] started he knew somewhere you know but
[1:23:09] he was in the depths he was in a problem
[1:23:11] amen but notice this see he says if he
[1:23:14] can do that how much more
[1:23:16] ought we under these present conditions
[1:23:19] look away from our symptoms to the
[1:23:21] throne of God where Jesus sits at the
[1:23:23] right hand of God on a throne by a
[1:23:26] temple that was made by God with his own
[1:23:29] blood to make good anything that we
[1:23:31] confess
[1:23:33] can you say Amen you think of that the
[1:23:35] prayer of Solomon's a Jonas so believing
[1:23:38] in that prayer that it caused him not to
[1:23:41] look at his conditions it caused him not
[1:23:43] to look at his surrounding it caused him
[1:23:46] to begin to pray in faith knowing that
[1:23:48] God would hear his prayer Amen in effect
[1:23:51] be the case then we've got an eternal
[1:23:54] God Amen and is a high priest that is
[1:23:57] making intercession on our prayer
[1:24:00] you realize that he's making an
[1:24:02] intercession on your prayers that's why
[1:24:04] you should pray
[1:24:05] that's why Satan bothers us with prayer
[1:24:07] that's why he hinders us because every
[1:24:09] time you pray you realize the prophet
[1:24:12] said that Jesus cannot make intercession
[1:24:13] for you until you pray okay you confess
[1:24:15] it
[1:24:16] he you've got to give him something to
[1:24:18] make intercession far
[1:24:22] can you say Amen but he's making
[1:24:24] intercession based off your prayer
[1:24:26] father I need you there's an inner
[1:24:28] ceasing he's interceding for you right
[1:24:30] then father I I need my finances met
[1:24:33] father I've got a mountain my father I
[1:24:35] need my my boy saved I need my family
[1:24:38] saved I need oh Father I don't know what
[1:24:41] to do I need a picking up in my heart I
[1:24:43] I just need you father amen and and the
[1:24:47] words that you're spitting out there in
[1:24:48] your prayer you don't have to be
[1:24:50] beautiful words just begin to pray begin
[1:24:52] to speak words and there he is
[1:24:54] interceding on your confession
[1:25:00] you believe that
[1:25:02] amen
[1:25:04] you know the prophet speaking of Jonah
[1:25:08] then he says this you can't hide a saint
[1:25:10] from prayer
[1:25:12] he said I don't care where you go
[1:25:15] You Can't Hide a saint from prayer
[1:25:19] he could be in the depths of hell
[1:25:21] but he knows where it's at prayer
[1:25:24] he could be his back against the wall
[1:25:25] and it could be so Bleak that he don't
[1:25:27] know what to do but get him on his knees
[1:25:29] and he'll start praying
[1:25:31] then you say Amen well look at Paul he
[1:25:33] was in the middle of the ocean the ways
[1:25:35] amen were sinking the ship they were
[1:25:37] Shipwrecked amen and and all hope was
[1:25:40] lost but there was a man on that ship
[1:25:43] that knew how to pray and he began to
[1:25:44] pray in the middle of the storm in the
[1:25:46] middle of everything when it looked like
[1:25:48] it was no hope amen he got on his knees
[1:25:51] and he prayed through amen until he can
[1:25:53] look at them men and say man fear not
[1:25:55] for an angel of the Lord appear to me
[1:25:57] and told me not one man that abide in
[1:26:00] this ship will be lost
[1:26:02] why pray through
[1:26:08] you didn't say oh let's let's turn on
[1:26:10] Fox News
[1:26:13] let's let's watch a movie folks
[1:26:16] we got we get we got a lot of we got a
[1:26:19] lot of problems let's get our minds off
[1:26:20] the problems you anybody got a boat so
[1:26:22] we can go to Hawaii for a little while
[1:26:24] thank you
[1:26:26] no
[1:26:28] there was one man that knew how to pray
[1:26:32] he understood the value of Prayer
[1:26:35] can you say man
[1:26:37] and the prophet said he prayed through
[1:26:39] pray through
[1:26:41] you see prayer
[1:26:43] works
[1:26:45] the Hebrew children when they're facing
[1:26:48] the fiery furnace
[1:26:49] brother Brahman said they prayed through
[1:26:51] they knew it was okay
[1:26:53] Daniel and the Lion's Den
[1:26:55] that Prophet said he prayed through
[1:26:58] he knew it'd be all right
[1:27:00] Joseph in prison pray through Paul and
[1:27:03] Silas in the jailhouse
[1:27:05] they prayed through
[1:27:06] can you say Amen
[1:27:08] see you you the prophet said you can put
[1:27:11] the believer in any condition wherever
[1:27:13] it may be and they'll pray through they
[1:27:17] know the power of prayer can you say
[1:27:19] Amen they know the power of prayer see
[1:27:21] we're not carnal Believers that don't
[1:27:23] know the Our God we we're not one that
[1:27:26] is professed Believers and yet we've got
[1:27:28] our own imagination of God and and that
[1:27:30] imagination he does not answer prayer
[1:27:33] and he just leaves us the way we are so
[1:27:35] we have to just defend for ourselves we
[1:27:37] have to lean to the politics we have to
[1:27:39] lean to the stock market we have to lean
[1:27:40] to investment we have to lean to the
[1:27:42] psychologist we have to lean to all of
[1:27:44] that no no no we're not that type of
[1:27:46] people we are the Saints of the Living
[1:27:48] God that have the power Amen to shake
[1:27:51] the hells of the walls of Hell by our
[1:27:55] prayer
[1:27:56] and the weakest of Christians
[1:27:59] when they go on their knees
[1:28:02] amen the devil's tremble
[1:28:06] brother Brahman says a real believer
[1:28:08] holds on to that prayer he said I don't
[1:28:10] care what take place he holds on to that
[1:28:13] prayer
[1:28:14] one place who said you find Christ on
[1:28:16] your knees
[1:28:20] you get answers
[1:28:21] when you fall on your knees
[1:28:25] James says you have not because you
[1:28:27] ask not
[1:28:31] brother Bram says in one place when
[1:28:33] Israel started praying for a prophet God
[1:28:35] had the prophet
[1:28:36] God had the prophet all the time he had
[1:28:38] the answer all the time
[1:28:40] because God's always a jump ahead of
[1:28:43] them not
[1:28:44] think of this quote now
[1:28:46] you're not waiting for God to do
[1:28:48] something like it's your idea
[1:28:53] like hello God
[1:28:56] don't you know hello
[1:28:58] I don't know where you're at you you
[1:29:00] behind him I don't know he's he's
[1:29:02] already a step ahead of you
[1:29:04] he's already got the answer
[1:29:06] see he already had a prophet waiting for
[1:29:08] him
[1:29:09] but here's what a prophet said but he
[1:29:11] was waiting for the people to go to
[1:29:12] praying
[1:29:14] he was waiting for the people to really
[1:29:16] want the answer
[1:29:17] he was waiting for the people for God to
[1:29:20] really come through on the scene he had
[1:29:22] him waiting that he was waiting for the
[1:29:24] people to realize they needed it
[1:29:27] can you say amen and when they started
[1:29:29] to pray God had the prophet on the sin
[1:29:33] I'm gonna tell you something God's
[1:29:35] already got your answer
[1:29:37] God or he's got to figure it out he
[1:29:39] already knows what he's going to do to
[1:29:40] work this problem out he already knows
[1:29:43] amen how to defeat the enemy in your
[1:29:45] life whatever Mountain you're he knows
[1:29:47] how to dissolve it
[1:29:49] it's not up to say well I wonder how
[1:29:50] they if I speak to it I wonder how it's
[1:29:52] going to leave I wonder I just wonder
[1:29:53] forget about it
[1:29:55] it's not up to you to figure all of that
[1:29:57] out let don't don't control God
[1:30:01] just pray
[1:30:03] just speak
[1:30:06] God promised to answer prayer
[1:30:10] you believe it
[1:30:11] John 14 13 and whatsoever you shall ask
[1:30:14] in my name that will I do that the
[1:30:16] father may be glory in the fight in the
[1:30:18] son if you shall ask anything everybody
[1:30:21] say anything
[1:30:22] come on now anything
[1:30:25] is there any barriers to that well Tim
[1:30:28] is there any barriers is there is there
[1:30:30] just little parts that we can only pray
[1:30:31] for
[1:30:32] not I think anything means everything I
[1:30:35] think anything means
[1:30:37] everywhere whatever you want it's yours
[1:30:40] if you ask anything in my name that's no
[1:30:43] wonder the prophet said ask big
[1:30:45] ask for big things
[1:30:52] how many has ever had God do something
[1:30:54] for you
[1:30:58] can he do it again
[1:31:00] [Music]
[1:31:03] when you prayed did he do it
[1:31:06] amen
[1:31:10] you know my mom
[1:31:12] we were we were really poor back in the
[1:31:14] day
[1:31:16] and we didn't have money to to buy
[1:31:19] things and Mom's wash machine broke down
[1:31:23] and we didn't have the money to get it
[1:31:25] fixed
[1:31:26] mom knew it
[1:31:30] so she's like man I Lord I gotta I gotta
[1:31:33] I got a wash here
[1:31:36] and
[1:31:38] so she just put her hands up on that
[1:31:41] that washer and said in the name of
[1:31:43] Jesus Christ I rebuke you Satan
[1:31:45] made this thing start working
[1:31:48] started working
[1:31:50] why God answered prayer
[1:31:53] you believe it
[1:31:57] amen God answers prayer
[1:32:00] yes he does
[1:32:04] I was on
[1:32:05] me and Josiah doing a job and we've done
[1:32:08] we was doing 36 stumps just right in a
[1:32:11] row
[1:32:12] oh my second to the last
[1:32:15] my machine started acting up
[1:32:18] I thought Man this ain't the time for it
[1:32:21] to be acting up I won't go home I mean I
[1:32:24] won't get done with this job I don't
[1:32:25] want to come back you know and so we
[1:32:28] thought you know we didn't know what it
[1:32:29] was so brother Josiah went and got some
[1:32:32] more gas just in case that was it and it
[1:32:34] was just barely gone just barely I
[1:32:36] thought man you know just something just
[1:32:38] pray and don't remind me of Mom praying
[1:32:41] so I just laid my hands on that thing I
[1:32:42] said Satan I rebuke you in the name of
[1:32:44] Jesus Christ whatever is wrong with this
[1:32:47] machine
[1:32:48] you leave it alone
[1:32:50] and I'll get these stumps done and that
[1:32:53] thing backfired
[1:32:56] about scared the Daylights out of me and
[1:32:59] the thing ran
[1:33:01] didn't even have any problems since
[1:33:03] prayer works
[1:33:05] now God will do that for the natural
[1:33:07] things and God will do it for your eyes
[1:33:09] sister Bonnie he'll do it for your eyes
[1:33:12] he can do it he'll do it for your
[1:33:14] children he'll do it for anything that
[1:33:16] you have need of the weapon is in your
[1:33:19] hands
[1:33:20] you're not asking God to give you the
[1:33:22] weapon God's already supplied you with
[1:33:24] the weapon and really it's the easiest
[1:33:26] thing open thy mouth wide and I'll feel
[1:33:28] it and we all know how to talk
[1:33:32] then you say Amen we all know how to
[1:33:34] talk but a lot of times we allow Satan
[1:33:36] to use negative words use our mouth to
[1:33:39] speak negative words instead of speaking
[1:33:41] a negative word get down on your knees
[1:33:43] let let this preacher get down on his
[1:33:45] knees let the people get down on their
[1:33:47] knees and begin to pray and watch God
[1:33:50] come on the scene
[1:33:51] then you say amen that's right see if
[1:33:55] you ask anything in my name I'll do it
[1:33:56] now we know that he hasn't seen this
[1:33:58] just to anyone because later on in in
[1:34:00] John 15 17 15 7 we read this earlier but
[1:34:04] he said if you abide in me if you abide
[1:34:07] in me and my words abide in you my
[1:34:10] promises abide in you you're not
[1:34:11] receiving all the Hollywood you're not
[1:34:13] receiving junk you're actually taking in
[1:34:15] the word and you're receiving it you're
[1:34:17] believing it and saying Lord that's mine
[1:34:19] that's mine that's mine and that word
[1:34:21] abides in you can you say Amen then you
[1:34:24] shall ask what you will and it shall be
[1:34:27] done in unto you now brother Brown says
[1:34:30] see the Christian doesn't realize what a
[1:34:32] force he has when he kneels on his knees
[1:34:35] before almighty God In The Name of Jesus
[1:34:37] Christ he doesn't realize what power
[1:34:39] that is see if the people could only
[1:34:42] realize that what is given right unto
[1:34:46] them anything that you ask for will be
[1:34:50] given if you can appropriate the faith
[1:34:53] to believe it for God's word is true
[1:34:58] you believe that
[1:35:01] Moses father was a man of Prayer
[1:35:05] and he is actually one of the Bible
[1:35:09] characters that is a pattern of what we
[1:35:11] should be
[1:35:12] he was in slavery uh with the rest of
[1:35:15] Israel and all these things but he knew
[1:35:17] that God promised and I want you to
[1:35:20] listen now he knew that God promised to
[1:35:22] deliver them
[1:35:24] you see you must know what God promised
[1:35:28] and you must believe it
[1:35:31] you must know what God has promised and
[1:35:33] you must believe it
[1:35:34] this is where if you abide in me my word
[1:35:36] abide in you
[1:35:38] say no and and so this is where we'd
[1:35:41] read in our opening scripture pray
[1:35:43] everybody say pray with
[1:35:47] understanding
[1:35:48] pray with understanding so Abraham
[1:35:54] amram he he knew what God had promised
[1:35:57] he believed in it and so you know the
[1:36:00] prophet describes it how he would he
[1:36:01] came home one night to their little Hut
[1:36:04] and told his wife how bad it was getting
[1:36:06] him and all of these things and he told
[1:36:08] his wife he said you know I predict that
[1:36:11] you know uh if God ever does anything
[1:36:13] for us it'll be after we're all dead and
[1:36:15] and it was just getting so bad so wicked
[1:36:18] and and they were now just putting women
[1:36:20] to work and and these things but the
[1:36:23] prophet said but God doesn't wait like
[1:36:25] that
[1:36:27] God doesn't wait until we're all dead
[1:36:29] and defeated and weak and destroyed
[1:36:33] that he says he watches us sometimes
[1:36:37] God watches
[1:36:39] so that night a amaram went somewhere
[1:36:42] and he started praying like he never
[1:36:43] prayed before and brother Brown said now
[1:36:46] that's the way to pray pray like you
[1:36:48] never prayed before
[1:36:51] get desperate
[1:36:54] I hope this is helping us
[1:36:56] he said if you just go up and say Lord
[1:36:58] bless so and so and so and so well God
[1:37:02] doesn't God don't take the interest much
[1:37:04] to that
[1:37:05] but when you really get down to business
[1:37:07] when you little boys and girls pray get
[1:37:09] down to business
[1:37:11] he said do you do that in school you ask
[1:37:13] God to help you in school when you're
[1:37:15] going to go to school don't you make uh
[1:37:18] he said and you don't make a very good
[1:37:20] grades you go in and say God I want you
[1:37:22] to help me today
[1:37:24] do you have a secret place where you go
[1:37:26] pray where Mommy and Daddy don't even
[1:37:28] see you do you pray like that you don't
[1:37:30] you don't pray like that you know he's
[1:37:33] talking to little ones but he says have
[1:37:35] a little place step out and pray and say
[1:37:37] your little prayer you say it every
[1:37:39] night before you go to bed he said when
[1:37:41] you get up at morning honey he says oh
[1:37:44] that's good he says how many other
[1:37:46] little boys and girls raise your hand he
[1:37:47] says that praise way over the building
[1:37:49] ain't that fine well that's good that
[1:37:51] shows you really you you got a real
[1:37:53] mother and daddy that teaches you to do
[1:37:55] those things when you really get in need
[1:37:57] you better pray sincerely haven't you
[1:38:00] see you know and and so he goes on of
[1:38:04] how that amaran got so desperate until
[1:38:06] he didn't want to suffer that night and
[1:38:07] his wife tried to get him to eat because
[1:38:10] he was so frail and and all that and he
[1:38:12] says no he's like I just can't eat he's
[1:38:14] I just gotta go pray and and so she
[1:38:16] she's trying to tell him no no eating he
[1:38:19] says you know he says but dear if
[1:38:21] somebody don't take the people the heart
[1:38:23] if somebody don't pray for the people
[1:38:24] what are we going to do see we're
[1:38:26] getting worse surely sometimes God will
[1:38:29] hear see amen and he says that's right
[1:38:32] God will hear can you say that with me
[1:38:34] God will hear you get down to business
[1:38:37] and just stay there ain't that right see
[1:38:40] so it's up to us now Abraham amen really
[1:38:43] he was him and his wife were just about
[1:38:45] the only Believers that really just
[1:38:47] believed God and it took him it took
[1:38:49] somebody to get on their knees and get
[1:38:51] to desperate amen not just for himself
[1:38:54] but for the people Amen in church if we
[1:38:56] ain't going to get desperate who is
[1:38:58] going to get desperate if we don't take
[1:39:00] our children before the Lord who's going
[1:39:02] to do it if we don't take one another
[1:39:04] before the Lord if we don't come down
[1:39:06] into desperation and to pray who's going
[1:39:09] to do it can you say amen he said so he
[1:39:12] says this time he goes upstairs
[1:39:13] different he goes upstairs this time he
[1:39:16] kneels down he puts his hands up in the
[1:39:18] air and he hollers God I'm speaking to
[1:39:20] you now he says see amen get into
[1:39:22] business God thou has steers and you can
[1:39:25] hear thou Hast eyes and you can see thou
[1:39:28] has to memory you know your words you
[1:39:30] know your promise I plead to you God
[1:39:32] look down here the god of Abraham Isaac
[1:39:35] and Jacob that your people are in
[1:39:37] distress and they're dying do something
[1:39:39] for us God we've got to have you at once
[1:39:42] we just got to have you or we're going
[1:39:43] to perish we must have you see we just
[1:39:47] got to if we live he said that's when
[1:39:49] you really pray he said Oh my he prayed
[1:39:53] amen see sometimes when we pray we get
[1:39:56] tired how many gets tired when you pray
[1:39:58] well brother Brown says I do too he's
[1:40:00] like I get tired he says fasting and and
[1:40:03] and you're praying he said you pray I
[1:40:05] pray I pray I pray and then you go
[1:40:08] preaching and he says oh he says I just
[1:40:10] get so tired see amen he says but that's
[1:40:13] no time to give up you keep on for God
[1:40:16] will answer yes sir keep holding on
[1:40:21] can you say Amen Keep Holding On so
[1:40:24] amram said to his wife I'm going up to
[1:40:26] pray now if you hear me weeping don't
[1:40:28] you come up well but Abram Amor amram
[1:40:31] what are you going to do honey you're
[1:40:33] just about dead he said yes but I got
[1:40:35] the people the burden of the people in
[1:40:37] my heart I got to do something I got to
[1:40:39] stay on my knees you know and and again
[1:40:41] we're called to intercede amen that
[1:40:44] that's what we're called uh is to
[1:40:46] intercede for the people amen for The
[1:40:49] Sinner for our lost loved ones and and
[1:40:51] and what you're doing in prayer you're
[1:40:53] bringing them up before the throne of
[1:40:56] grace there there are loved ones look at
[1:40:58] them they they're cut off from God
[1:40:59] Satan's cut them off that because of
[1:41:02] their sin and and all of that but you as
[1:41:05] a as a daddy as a mom as preachers as as
[1:41:09] whatever as a scene of God you're toting
[1:41:12] this into your heart and you're taking
[1:41:14] those that can't pray that are bound by
[1:41:17] the devil and now you're coming and
[1:41:19] holding them before the Throne of Grace
[1:41:21] that God could intercede on your prayer
[1:41:26] [Music]
[1:41:32] Abram was doing that amram by praying
[1:41:35] holding the people up in prayer
[1:41:38] but notice what brother Branham said the
[1:41:40] people were getting bitter
[1:41:43] against God because they prayed and
[1:41:45] prayed and prayed and nothing was
[1:41:47] happening
[1:41:50] so the people were getting bitter
[1:41:53] and he said that's the same thing that's
[1:41:55] happening today
[1:41:57] people get bitter with God because they
[1:42:00] don't see things working out the way
[1:42:01] they think it should work out
[1:42:04] and so therefore there was hardly anyone
[1:42:07] back then that believed that God still
[1:42:09] answered prayer
[1:42:10] but thank God for an amram
[1:42:13] that believed that God answered prayer
[1:42:16] can you say Amen
[1:42:18] and and and if there's ever a Time
[1:42:23] that we need to pray
[1:42:26] it's now
[1:42:27] because I've I've as I've told you amen
[1:42:30] we're we're fighting the worst stage
[1:42:33] we're in living in the worst age ever
[1:42:35] Satan's had more freedom in this age
[1:42:38] than ever before because the people have
[1:42:40] empowered him
[1:42:41] demons are pouring out in every every
[1:42:44] way amen and if there's ever a time that
[1:42:47] a people must not get bitter against God
[1:42:50] it's now
[1:42:52] don't let your heart get hardened in
[1:42:54] your troubles don't let your heart when
[1:42:55] you see the situations and it's and it
[1:42:57] seems like it's getting worse don't you
[1:42:59] let the devil Harden your heart to where
[1:43:01] you'll get bitter against God do you
[1:43:03] think that there's no use in praying
[1:43:09] today our young people are at the
[1:43:11] crossroads in life
[1:43:14] and I read this quote
[1:43:18] and
[1:43:19] it was in 1956
[1:43:22] notice what brother Bram says he says do
[1:43:25] you realize old men
[1:43:26] when we were boys now this is in 1956 so
[1:43:30] figure where we're at today and multiply
[1:43:33] that
[1:43:34] but he said you realize old men when we
[1:43:36] were boys our boys has got 10 times the
[1:43:40] Temptation that we had
[1:43:42] sister do you realize that your daughter
[1:43:44] has 10 times the Temptation you had when
[1:43:47] you was a girl
[1:43:48] what will her daughter have
[1:43:51] look at the things the pictures the
[1:43:53] Devils of painting oh
[1:43:56] how we need to pray
[1:43:59] hello
[1:44:00] how we need to pray
[1:44:02] TV was just coming in they didn't have
[1:44:05] cell phones they didn't have all this
[1:44:06] crazy stupid apps
[1:44:11] people didn't spend their time going
[1:44:13] taking selfies
[1:44:17] getting so wrapped up in every carnal
[1:44:19] thing in this world
[1:44:21] and yet brother Branham saying that
[1:44:24] their children his children had it 10
[1:44:26] times worse than what he had
[1:44:28] so look where our children are today
[1:44:30] compared to that
[1:44:32] how we need to pray
[1:44:34] how we need to pray can you say Amen
[1:44:38] how we need to pray he said see brother
[1:44:41] do you realize we don't pray half as
[1:44:43] much as our fathers did Pastor do you no
[1:44:46] we don't put as much time on our knees
[1:44:48] as pastors before us did women do you
[1:44:51] realize we don't instruct your daughter
[1:44:53] uh you don't instruct your daughter and
[1:44:55] pray with her at night like your mother
[1:44:57] did you then what about it who's guilty
[1:45:00] we're guilty can you say Amen so here's
[1:45:03] a prophet amen not just opening the
[1:45:05] seals for us but he's opening uh calling
[1:45:08] us back to prayer calling us back to the
[1:45:10] greatest weapon we are not to set in
[1:45:12] this assembly and set in this age as
[1:45:15] though we're helpless as though and let
[1:45:16] the devil ravish our children and rape
[1:45:19] their minds and do this and have his way
[1:45:21] and we just sit there oh my God I don't
[1:45:23] know what I'm going to do you do know
[1:45:25] what you do amen and that is get on the
[1:45:27] near knees to pray and there ain't no
[1:45:29] devil big enough to hinder your prayer
[1:45:33] can you say Amen it may take a little
[1:45:35] while to get there amen but but there's
[1:45:38] a Warfare you remember now amen how
[1:45:40] Daniel began to pray but there was a
[1:45:42] Warfare it wasn't that God didn't hear
[1:45:45] him God heard him the very first word
[1:45:46] together and he came down to answer but
[1:45:49] Satan was there Amen to withstand him
[1:45:51] amen and that battle raised him there
[1:45:54] for 21 days there was a spiritual
[1:45:57] warfare but God prevailed and I say to
[1:45:59] you God always prevails when a saint
[1:46:02] will get on their knees
[1:46:04] you don't understand
[1:46:09] you may not understand the warfare
[1:46:11] that's going on right now
[1:46:13] because you're on your knees
[1:46:16] praying
[1:46:18] praying
[1:46:20] praying
[1:46:22] but you remember this God will answer
[1:46:23] your prayer
[1:46:25] God promised he'll answer
[1:46:28] can you say man
[1:46:30] may we be a people of Prayer
[1:46:33] prayer
[1:46:35] you said see Abraham Ram believe that
[1:46:38] God still answered prayer he got right
[1:46:41] down to business that's how we have to
[1:46:42] do it get right down to business he said
[1:46:45] God you promised this and we've looked
[1:46:47] forward to it and we've seen all the
[1:46:50] seen the signs all year and the time is
[1:46:52] at hand it's time for you to do
[1:46:54] something about it and while he was deep
[1:46:56] in deep consecrated prayer praying with
[1:46:59] all of his heart he looked and standing
[1:47:01] in the corner see he rubbed his eyes and
[1:47:04] looked again there stood an angel with
[1:47:05] the sword drawn and he said Deliverance
[1:47:07] is coming and you're going to bring a
[1:47:10] son into the world and he's going to be
[1:47:11] the one to deliver them you see God
[1:47:14] always answers prayer doesn't he if
[1:47:17] we're just hold on and I say to you
[1:47:20] tonight keep holding on ain't that right
[1:47:22] but another thing is I get ready to
[1:47:24] close look at the prayer that amram
[1:47:26] prayed he prayed based on God's promise
[1:47:32] his prayer was founded on God's promise
[1:47:35] you promised it God
[1:47:38] are you with me you promised it God
[1:47:41] see and we know the promise Genesis 15
[1:47:45] 13. God said unto Abram no of a surety
[1:47:49] that thy seed shall be a stranger in a
[1:47:51] land that is not theirs and Shall Serve
[1:47:53] them and they shall afflict them 400
[1:47:55] years and also that Nation whom they
[1:47:57] Shall Serve will I judge and afterward
[1:47:59] they shall come out with great substance
[1:48:01] see so his prayer amram's prayer was
[1:48:05] founded on the promise that God made
[1:48:06] ain't that right now I want you to
[1:48:09] notice this now uh uh as I was reading
[1:48:13] uh brother Branham and I thought this
[1:48:15] was profound amen and but he said you
[1:48:18] know the Hebrew children didn't have any
[1:48:21] promise to base their prayer upon
[1:48:24] he said see they couldn't get back here
[1:48:27] and read in the Bible and say Lord you
[1:48:29] promised in your word that any of your
[1:48:31] children ever went into a fiery furnace
[1:48:33] you would deliver them
[1:48:34] all right Lord so we're coming right
[1:48:36] there based on that
[1:48:38] ain't that right
[1:48:40] amen see brother Brown said if they had
[1:48:42] a promise like that it wouldn't been so
[1:48:44] hard to pray it wouldn't have been hard
[1:48:46] just to see it it wouldn't because there
[1:48:49] would have been a promise but God never
[1:48:51] gave them a promise such as that
[1:48:54] hello but you know where there was God
[1:48:57] is able
[1:48:59] our God is able can you say that with me
[1:49:01] our God is able our God is able so now
[1:49:04] now you've got the promises
[1:49:07] you can read about the Hebrew boys
[1:49:09] that's a promise you can read about
[1:49:11] Daniel in the Lion's Den and watch God
[1:49:12] come down on the scene that's a promise
[1:49:14] to you everything that God done to that
[1:49:16] natural seed is now yours for you are
[1:49:19] heirs and Joint Heirs of Jesus Christ
[1:49:22] [Applause]
[1:49:24] and you say Amen so all see so brother
[1:49:27] Brown said see if they had a promise
[1:49:29] like that all they had to do was just
[1:49:31] anchor their faith because God had
[1:49:32] already promised it amen see but God was
[1:49:35] so real to them God was so real to them
[1:49:38] that they just simply told the king our
[1:49:41] God is able you do whatever you want to
[1:49:44] do but I'm telling you God God is able
[1:49:47] and if it be so that you're able to
[1:49:49] carry this threat we still ain't going
[1:49:51] to bow down God was so real to them
[1:49:54] ain't that right so the prophet said
[1:49:56] they walked in that furnace with sheer
[1:49:58] faith not based on one God had promised
[1:50:01] but upon God is able
[1:50:05] sheer faith not upon what God had
[1:50:07] promised but upon God is able ain't that
[1:50:10] right so brother Branham says now what
[1:50:12] is it going to be for those people who
[1:50:14] had the promise and still didn't trust
[1:50:16] God
[1:50:19] what is it going to be for those of us
[1:50:22] that have the promise and still didn't
[1:50:24] trust God
[1:50:25] they didn't try to they they had no
[1:50:28] promise and they still trusted God ain't
[1:50:30] that right so here God by their faith
[1:50:34] sheer faith in God is able God honored
[1:50:37] that faith and sent Christ down to Fan
[1:50:40] the flames and delivered them from that
[1:50:42] fiery furnace aren't you glad for that
[1:50:44] amen so notice now today we do not come
[1:50:48] before the throne of grace in prayer
[1:50:50] saying God you're able God you're able
[1:50:53] God you're able can you say Amen no see
[1:50:57] our prayers are based upon the promises
[1:51:00] that God gave God that you said God that
[1:51:04] you promised not God you're able but God
[1:51:07] you promised it can you say Amen now I
[1:51:09] don't care what situation you're in
[1:51:11] there is a Bible full of promises that
[1:51:14] you can take to God and not say God
[1:51:16] you're able God I know I know you're
[1:51:18] able but it says I am the god that
[1:51:20] healeth thee amen now you say God you
[1:51:23] promised it can you say Amen
[1:51:28] shall be saved amen not God you're able
[1:51:31] but God you promised it you said it in
[1:51:35] your word and that's where my faith is
[1:51:37] based upon yeah
[1:51:40] our prayers are based on the promise
[1:51:43] that God gave
[1:51:45] brother Brown said you say God you
[1:51:47] promised it and more than that you've
[1:51:49] already prepared it at Calvary
[1:51:51] it's already done
[1:51:53] can you say Amen you provided it and I
[1:51:56] see others receiving it so I come to you
[1:51:59] Lord amen to get my part of it brother
[1:52:01] Brown said if you come like that you'll
[1:52:03] go away a different person you'll go
[1:52:05] away with such an anchor inside your
[1:52:07] soul that nothing can upset you you know
[1:52:10] that you're healed you know that God has
[1:52:12] taken care of this matter for you
[1:52:13] because he promised it
[1:52:15] [Music]
[1:52:17] well do you love the Lord
[1:52:19] isn't he wonderful
[1:52:22] so that's the way we come to God's
[1:52:24] promises is we come boldly and accept
[1:52:27] them and that's the prayer of faith
[1:52:30] God you promised it not an accusation
[1:52:35] not accusing God
[1:52:37] then God you promise it now look
[1:52:40] look at it where are you
[1:52:42] no no no
[1:52:44] you come God you promised it that's
[1:52:46] where my faith is
[1:52:48] that's why I'm here praying because you
[1:52:51] promised it
[1:52:54] God through Christ has prepared a way
[1:52:56] and I come to accept it it's an easy
[1:52:59] thing when you look and see what the
[1:53:00] promise was made by if you see that it
[1:53:03] was God that made the promise see if God
[1:53:05] made the promise God is able to keep his
[1:53:07] promise
[1:53:08] oh aren't you glad for that
[1:53:10] do you love the Lord isn't he wonderful
[1:53:13] my my mind so don't be afraid to ask God
[1:53:16] anything
[1:53:17] don't limit your prayer don't limit God
[1:53:19] ain't that right you must ask God for
[1:53:22] anything that he has promised I I know
[1:53:25] I'm running out of time I got a lot to
[1:53:28] go but but there is one thing that I am
[1:53:30] going to read to you if the musicians
[1:53:31] will come
[1:53:33] amen
[1:53:39] now I want you to listen to what brother
[1:53:40] Brown said
[1:53:42] don't have confidence in your prayer
[1:53:46] can you say that with me don't have
[1:53:49] confidence in your prayer
[1:53:52] have confidence
[1:53:54] in what he said
[1:53:58] he said it
[1:54:00] and every devil is trembling
[1:54:05] not trembling at your prayer
[1:54:08] it's not how eloquent of a prayer you
[1:54:10] can do
[1:54:12] remember the boy that didn't know how to
[1:54:13] pray
[1:54:15] so he started saying a b c d
[1:54:18] [Music]
[1:54:20] some guy heard is some guy heard the boy
[1:54:22] saying ABC he's what are you doing he's
[1:54:24] I'm praying
[1:54:26] is how you praying like that he said
[1:54:28] well mister I don't know how to pray
[1:54:31] he's about figured if I just say the
[1:54:32] alphabet God can put it all together and
[1:54:34] know what I'm saying what I'm meaning
[1:54:37] see it's not the eloquence of Prayer
[1:54:41] it's not words sometimes we go into our
[1:54:44] closet and we don't even know what to
[1:54:45] say
[1:54:47] I know for me
[1:54:48] and this has really helped me just to be
[1:54:51] honest because there's sometimes I I
[1:54:53] want to approach it right
[1:54:56] I want to set just right and sometimes I
[1:54:58] mess it all up and the devil whips me on
[1:55:00] my minds and see
[1:55:02] you didn't say it right
[1:55:05] so then I'm trying to say it all over
[1:55:06] again
[1:55:09] they said I realized it's not confidence
[1:55:10] in my prayer
[1:55:12] it's confidence in what he said
[1:55:16] God you just take my prayer that's all
[1:55:18] messed up
[1:55:21] but I'm just reminding you what you said
[1:55:23] you said Lord
[1:55:26] My Heart Is Anchored In what you said
[1:55:30] brother Graham said God not not with not
[1:55:33] confidence in my prayer but confidence
[1:55:35] in your promise no matter how little it
[1:55:37] is
[1:55:37] what it is how weak our prayer is
[1:55:40] God you promised it
[1:55:43] you promised
[1:55:45] Hallelujah
[1:55:47] another place he said we thank and
[1:55:50] praise thee for the privilege that we
[1:55:51] have of coming before thee in the way of
[1:55:54] prayer knowing this first that it is
[1:55:57] promised to us
[1:55:58] that if you ask anything in my name I'll
[1:56:00] do it and we have that assurance
[1:56:04] that you'll Grant
[1:56:06] our request
[1:56:08] do you have that Assurance tonight
[1:56:10] Church
[1:56:12] oh my
[1:56:13] we have the assurance that he'll Grant
[1:56:17] our request
[1:56:20] that's why I called you
[1:56:21] [Music]
[1:56:23] that's why I saved you that's why I put
[1:56:25] you through the valleys that's why he
[1:56:26] allows the mountains to appear in before
[1:56:28] you
[1:56:29] because he has confidence that you can
[1:56:31] pray the prayer of faith
[1:56:33] he has confidence that he can move on
[1:56:35] the scene for you and show himself to be
[1:56:37] real
[1:56:38] Because he believes that you'll pray
[1:56:39] that prayer faith
[1:56:42] that you anchor your prayer Yankee your
[1:56:44] faith yanker everything into what he
[1:56:45] promised
[1:56:46] and here's a whole Bible full of
[1:56:48] promises
[1:56:49] Hallelujah aren't you glad for that
[1:56:52] aren't you glad the book has been open
[1:56:55] Alleluia just makes our faith so much
[1:56:57] easier just to take it and say God you
[1:57:00] promised it
[1:57:01] I believe it
[1:57:02] I know it'll work out
[1:57:04] Hallelujah I love the Lord that all is
[1:57:09] over
[1:57:10] Victory is one
[1:57:14] it's already
[1:57:16] done
[1:57:19] oh it's already Hallelujah

[1:57:43] oh I have overcome I have overcome how
[1:57:50] Hallelujah

[1:58:37] saved Hallelujah
[1:58:42] they're already saved

[1:58:51] Victory is one
[1:58:56] hallelujah it's already done

[1:59:14] is over
