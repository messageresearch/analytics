glad that he has proven it to us amen it's good to be here the house of the Lord and uh trust everyone had a good day staying warm amen and uh good to have brother Andrew and sister Mariah with us tonight praise the Lord and um that brother Bob with us and as well amen and U amen um the musicians can be dismissed but uh if you have your Bibles we're just going to go right into the word um Hebrews the 2nd chapter amen the Lord is so good to us amen amen Hebrews two and uh we'll start at the 14th verse for as much then as the children are partakers of Flesh and Blood he also himself likewise took part of the same that through death he might destroy him that had the power o of death that is the devil and deliver them who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage for verily he took not on himself the nature of angels but took on him the Seed of Abraham wherefore in all things it behooved him to be made like unto his Brethren that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to God to make reconciliation for the sins of the people for in that he himself hath suffered being tempted he is able to secur them that are tempted amen then if you'd like to uh uh go uh Hebrews the 4th chapter and Hebrews 4 and 14 we'll start there seeing then that we have a great high priest that has passed into the heavens Jesus the son of God let us hold fast our profession for we have not a high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities but in was in all points tempted like as we are yet without sin Let Us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace that we may obtain mercy and find Grace to help in time of need amen let's just bow our heads and talk to our Lord father the scriptures that we have read is so profound Lord and it just causes us to to rest in you Lord and we pray father that you would just make it more real make it more clear to us father just let it anchor into our soul I pray father that you would anoint both speaker and hearer tonight bless what simple words we would have father pray that your blood would just cover us now father if there be any sick among us any discouraged Lord or whatever the need would be may you just touch them we ask it in Jesus Christ's name amen amen you can have your seat this evening I want to continue along the thought of our great high priest and um of course in the Old Testament uh as as we know God had established a uh a priesthood and and Paul talks about it um as well as uh Leviticus and uh different places but uh he established this this priesthood and had uh appointed Aaron uh to be uh the high priest and as we said uh last week Aaron uh his name uh means very high and he stood Supreme one writer said he stood Supreme as the high priest uh very high above his own house as well as exalted above the people and Aaron was a a descendant of Levi and um the Bible you know calls it the uh the the levitical priesthood or we would know it as the uh ironic I guess this ironic uh priesthood and um and and this is because it would come from a lineage of of priests out of out of the lineage Lage of Levi no man could be a a priest or a high priest um uh outside that lineage and so um brother brandham talked about how that uh those men in in that lineage they they weren't uh ordinary like you and I are uh in the sense that they had to come out of the lineage of Levi to be a priest and every priest had to be born uh from this lineage of this holy man and um they had to be perfectly good priests uh brother brah said not even uh uh said one one little jot or anything wrong that stoned them to death uh they had to walk the line they had to be Orthodox Gun Barrel straight they had to be real men they had to know that law and and so as we we look at it but yet as as as uh strict as they were and as as um God required of them yet it was just a priesthood of of men and so Paul there in in Hebrews 7 and 23 it says and there they truly were many priests uh because uh they were not suffered to continue by reason of death so so we we see that that uh uh when when one priest died another priest took its place and then and it was just carrying on one priest after another after another and and and things and but also they they had to not all only offer blood for the people but they had to offer blood for themselves and then this this levitical priesthood uh the only blood that they had to offer was animal blood uh uh to God and and of course we know that that blood uh was not uh sufficient and so so through through all of this this priesthood had to to come to an end it it had uh uh to be abolished it was only temporary and this is what Paul when he's dealing with the Jews they couldn't understand that how could God ordain something and and set in order and and then all of a sudden abolish it but uh you know the the the prophet says that that even God would show through Moses that that this this levitical priesthood would come to its end he said because when God gave Moses the law was given to Moses there at the Ten Commandments and he had this this this Stone uh uh in his hands and he says the weakness of Moses Moses had a weakness and that was his temper and uh and because of that uh he he threw them stone that rock on the ground and it just it broke and uh it it it shattered and so brother brandham said it showed right then that the levitical priesthood would be broken but see it could be broken it it could be broken because the that that levitical priesthood was not uh uh uh established based up on an oath amen it was not established on an oath and so because when God establishes something with an oath then it cannot be destroyed but but there in Hebrews the the 7eventh chapter and we'll get into it in in a minute but uh uh Paul would tell us that that the levitical priesthood was not established this line of priest and the lineage of of Levi it was not established by an oath even though God uh uh put him uh put him there and and and started this this priesthood but it was only to show of another priesthood to come and so uh uh but but this is why I think this is what makes us different even as the people of God uh from from just the church world the Church of the Living God has been established by an oath that God has given amen there's all kinds of churches and Brides brides and as the prophet says and all that but there's only been one that has been established by an oath and this is why the Church of God will never fail and and it keeps on enduring being fed to the Lions and burnt at the Stak and and and all kinds of things but it it it still stands and so if you notice that God um uh uh uh he he thought it necessary to to secure the the the the faith of his elect Amen in something that would be solid and he he never intended for for our faith uh to rest in in a bunch of men and and he never intended for our our faith to to rest in man period it it doesn't matter what it was it it don't matter the gift it don't matter the the position it it it doesn't matter anything amen our faith is not to rest amen upon Humanity ain't that right and so therefore the the this priesthood of men uh had to be abolished and when it was then God established a a another uh priesthood uh um uh which was far superior to to the old ain't that right and so we we're looking and we have a great high priest and and and and that has been established not by through the lineage of of Levi amen but but uh of another order amen a a high priest that is is here to do a a far greater work than than what the the uh uh priesthood of men uh uh could ever do and so uh Hebrews 71 Paul would say if therefore Perfection were by the levitical priesthood for under it the people received the law what further need was there that another priest should rise after the order of MDC and not be called after the order of Aaron amen and so uh uh uh what what God is doing is he's meeting a need amen and and that need comes from his own word amen God is is is meeting something that would would Supply amen for his own word you see God uh uh we as we know spoke his word before the foundation of the world and and and when he spoke it then there there is a need that arises because God's word will never fail do you believe that God's word will never fail and so God has to supply that need in order to fulfill his word amen uh Jesus said Heaven and Earth shall pass away but my word shall never pass away ain't that right so so we know these scriptures but they are profound to us and and and we must hold them dear but uh uh Ephesians 41 and4 according as he hath chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world and and and what is that reason is that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children according to the good pleasure of his will ain't that right so so he he didn't just set you here on Earth but he predestinated you amen uh to something and and that we would be uh uh holy and Without Blame before him in love uh Romans 8:29 for whom he did Forno he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many Brethren moreover notice moreover whom he did past tense predestinate them he also called and them whom he called he also past tense Justified so he's already put you uh in in in a in a position amen he has already declared you and and and whom he justified he's already pasted in glorified amen see so in in God's mind that is the word concerning you amen Isaiah 54:17 no weapon that is formed against thee is going to prosper amen see every tongue that shall rise against thee in judgment Thou shalt condemn this is the heritage of the Servants of the Lord and the righteousness is of me sayith the Lord so that that is a promise that that is a word that that that has already been spoken do you believe that but but look at it we are a fallen people we are a people that that born with a carnal nature Paul says that we were by Nature the children of Wrath amen our our enemy is our accuser amen and and accusing us before the our very God our very Creator and the Very one that predestinated to to be without blame and and and before him in love the very one that spoke his word to about us he elect Satan is there amen bringing an accusation see so we we we know that God cannot stand to look upon sin he he he's holy and and sin to him uh is is such a a wicked thing and and that's why we we were alienated from him in the beginning and we were afflicted by sickness and diseases because of sin ain't that right amen and and and so we we we look at all these things but but God had already spoke his word concerning us before having done good or evil before we ever told our first lie before we ever amen had our temper uh tantrums and and all that God had already spoke a word concerning you so so as as the prophet says we were born defeated we were born amen going the negative we we were born not even re reflecting anything that God would predestinate us to be a ain't that right that God is determined that his word will never fail he he's determined of that ain't that right see because his word is not just a a a a passing thing it is a promise every promise that God makes or every word that God speaks is is a promise and he is determined to to to keep them so God's word God's word uh overrides every situation it it doesn't matter how impossible uh uh it is it it's going to override it because it comes from God himself ain't that right amen we we look at Psalms 10720 he sent his word and healed them and delivered them from their destructions it was the word of God that done it do you believe that amen I I just believe that when we began to preach about the promises of God that word has first priority over every devil in hell and God will sin preachers amen man to preach the healing power of God he sends his word and his word comes and and delivers and heals and and and things like that so God see God loves it when the situation gets worse and worse he he loves it when our our our back is against the wall and and and we just don't know what to do he because it it it magnifies him amen he he's the one that allows us to hit the bottom he's the one that allows us Amen to to to where it seems like we're going to go under amen you see but but as as the prophet had had uh uh talked about and we all know it about the law of God which is the law of contrast amen there there's that law of contrast our weakness contrast his strength our our uh inabilities contrasts his abilities our our failures contrast is a cont contr to his faithfulness ain't that right amen the the the the the the situations that we are limited to amen of of of being able to help it's our limitations are only a contrast to his his unlimited power and Supreme Being amen you see so so God God doesn't God's not worried about his word he's not worried about whether his word is going to be able to to be fulfilled he's not worried about amen being able to keep his word amen you see it was uh even in in in Genesis there he asks Abraham Genesis 18:14 God would say to him is there anything too hard for the Lord amen it was Abraham that that was was wandering it was Abraham that that uh you know didn't understand everything amen but God had already gave him his word amen so so it wasn't you know Abraham I I I don't know what I'm going to do you know I'm kind of sitting here on the rock with you you know and don't know what to do you know but but it wasn't that at all God would ask him is there anything too hard for the Lord that that's what God wants I I believe he ask us you know uh uh uh in our situations that that question still stands is there anything too hard for the Lord amen and and and you can you you you can give the the worst scenario uh uh uh in your situation and yet the question would ring out is there anything too hard for the Lord amen you see um the the question that that God would ask Abraham amen is is in reference to the promise that God made to Abraham you see God told Abraham that he would have a son and that that he would call this son uh Isaac and and and and so God had already said his word it was going to happen amen but the the thing is is Abraham could not have children amen uh uh it was it was a problem for Abraham but yet God had already declared that he would have a son amen and he also said that Isaac would come through the womb of Sarah and and yet she couldn't have children she was Barren ain't that right and so God would tell Abraham that it would it would be through Isaac that that Abraham would become the father of Nations it would be through Isaac amen the Abraham seed would possess the Gate of his enemies ain't that right and yet Abraham couldn't do nothing about it because he couldn't have children and and so he had nothing to bring to the table and say God this is a good idea you know I've already had 20 of them so let's let's have another one and we'll just call him Isaac and we'll just move on with your plan well I Abraham could not do that he had not nothing to give he had nothing to offer amen you see so God didn't make this promise to well capable well aable people amen see but he would make it to a individuals that was totally impossible for This Promise Amen to come to pass without the help of the Lord amen and then he gives this promise when Abraham is 75 and Sarah is 65 on top of that he he you know he he could have you know just gave it to them when they were you know in their 20s and and things but God wanted this situation to become more impossible amen and more impossible because no matter how how impossible the situation gets God is still on the throne it never changes God's word can you say amen amen see so he gives the promise to Abraham at 75 Sarah 65 and then on top of that he waits 25 five more years amen uh uh uh allowing them to get older ain't that right becoming a more impossible situation and so we know that they weren't able to have children in the first place see but but see God knew when he gave the promise he knew it would take himself to fulfill it and that's what he wanted he wanted to be the one he wanted to be the the the god of of uh he's the only one that can secure his promise do you believe that amen see so so we we look and and the Covenant that God had even made to Abraham wasn't an unconditional Covenant which means that that Abraham had nothing to do with it the prophet says you know it when God made it he said Abraham it's not if you do this then I'll do this and if you'll do that I'll do this it was Abraham I've already done it amen so so Abraham had nothing to do with it except he was the beneficiary of of the promise that God by Grace Sovereign Grace just gave to Abraham Abraham didn't deserve it Abraham wasn't worthy of it there was nothing that Abraham could have done to gain uh uh this this favor from God it was Grace Grace Grace can you say amen amen see and so the this Covenant that God made with Abraham it didn't rest in upon the capability of Abraham God would fulfill his own word when he gives the promise that you're going to have a son God would fulfill his own word do you believe that you see it's the unconditional Covenant that that brings out the attributes of God and magnifies him in such a way it magnified his Mercy it it magnified his faithfulness it magnified his transform forming power it it it magnified the the longsuffering of God Amen that God would wait and wait and wait and wait but at the right time amen see God doesn't have to give the promise and then immediately fulfill that promise he can wait as long as he wants to Amen to think of it he already called you into Perfection he already glorified you before time even started and here we are the world has been 6,000 years now and yet got that promise Still Remains true can you say Amen because it doesn't matter to God Amen you can be up today and down tomorrow you can have the money in the bank today and and be totally broke tomorrow but it does not matter to God Amen for God keeps his own word see it was a Covenant of Grace So then Abraham's weakness was not in the faith of of Abraham for his faith was not weak amen but it was in his ability to make the promise of God come to pass and I want to say it tonight that no matter how weak you are amen and how impossible you are the weakness does not lay in your faith amen the weakness lays in your ability to make it happen but don't you worry the God of all ability the god that is supreme is the one that made the promise Pro so Abraham all he could do was just rest in God's promise he couldn't hurry it up we all know that Sarah tried to make it happen amen through another way and and and it it it it just messed it up but it never detoured God from his word do you believe that amen we even look at at even even when Abraham went down into to egyp or wherever that was and and out out of the Homeland and he lied Amen to to aimc amen but yet God would never let that word amen uh be his word be detoured ain't that right amen see God Amen and and I like what the prophet said I was just I wish I had the quote before me but he said that just shows that that that you have not gone so far amen you see if you are a promised Son of God if you are a daughter of Promise amen it does not matter sin does not matter failure does not matter mistakes does not matter the prophet said just repent amen see there's a God there that is going to keep his word concerning his elect amen and so God it Abraham lied but God still kept his word amen Sarah doubted God but God still kept his word amen for his word was unconditional do you believe that amen it was unconditional so so we remember how that God made made a conditional Covenant with Adam that if you do this then I'll do this if you do this I'll do this and and yada yada you know and and we find that that Covenant it did not magnify God's strength it did not it only magnified Adam's weakness it it magnified amen the fact that he could not keep the end of his bargain ain't that right amen but we find out through Grace that it's through our weakness that God's strength is made perfect amen you see that's what God wants us to do he does not want our abilities and and and he doesn't want what we have to offer all he wants is us to trust him amen and the thing is is is we never had a a and we never had a choice in what we wanted to do we we it was God that chose us before we breathed our first breath do you believe that amen see and so then we we we can anchor our our our whole soul our faith our our joy Our Hope in the fact that God keeps his word concerning us amen the promises of God being fulfilled does not hinge on whether I can or cannot you see God never meant for us to obtain the promises on our own amen he doesn't mean you know when we preach the promises and you look at him you think I'm so far away from them things it it never God never meant to put you in panic mode never meant to put you in a I got to hurry I got to do this I got to do that no no no amen God is going to fulfill his word concerning his promises is elect and so even though uh uh uh you know that Abraham couldn't do it Sarah couldn't do it God knew it and and and at the time that when MDC appeared to to to Abraham there in Genesis 18 and10 He said I will ser certainly everybody say certainly I will certainly return unto thee according to the time of life and lo Sarah thy wife shall have a son you see God had to do something God had to meet the need in order for the promise to be fulfilled amen see in order for God to keep his word the prophet said he had to do something to Sarah's womb amen he had to give her a completely new womb because hers was old and gone he had to strengthen her heart amen see in order for her to to to give birth Amen to a child he had to give her new milk veins because uh uh they were dried up see and then look at Abraham his body was already dead amen uh concerning uh you know his manhood and things like that but through the power of transformation God was able to show his power and change them back to their youth again amen he changed their body and he turned them back to youth ain't that right see so then they had the child just as God had promised God kept his word because he was able to supply the need amen you see there's nothing too late for God I don't care how wward your child is there's nothing too late for God Amen I I don't care what the situation is there's nothing too late for God even the prophet says that if you had that you know if there's that perfect faith and doctor told you Friday that you're going to die Monday you would just look at him laugh in his face and say well amen glory to God you know why because nothing is too late for God we have seen this through the ministry of brother Brandon that it didn't matter if they were Skin and Bones and just laying there just a a a skin over bone amen yet the power of God would come into that woman amen and raise her up from the deathbed amen and many many times that we have seen God not only through the ministry of brother Brandon but even in our own lives we have seen God do it time and time and time again when our back was against the wall it looked like everything was going to cave in God stood there in time and brought us through how else do you think you made it this far it was God that done that can you sayen God keeps his word so nothing is ever too late for God see so the the the the weakness of Abraham and Sarah only perfected his ability amen see and so uh uh uh the prophet said God done that to Sarah and Abraham to show what he would do for us in this last day so you go think of that it's been years and thousands of years since Abraham and Sarah but as he was given them that promise as he was taking care of them amen he was also looking at what he was going to do for us in this day and he's here in the same mezc as he appeared to Abraham and Sarah amen then we find that when Isaac reached a certain age that God commanded Abraham to to go uh offer him up as a sacrifice amen and and Abraham being strong in faith uh done exactly as he was told amen and and uh uh uh you know Isaac looked and said dad you know I see the wood I see the I see everything for a sacrifice I problem is I don't see the sacrifice where's that at and and Abraham just said well son God will provide himself a lamb God will provide ain't that right and and we we know the story but Abraham uh he he he was so persuaded that God would keep his word amen that he he put Isaac bounding put him up on that Altar and he drew his knife and he was getting ready to uh plunge that knife through his heart and the angel of the Lord was stayed his hand amen and there was a a ram amen stuck in in the bush ain't that right see God showed up just in the right time amen that's right see and he showed himself as as Jehovah Gyra amen but why would God take time Amen to to to uh uh uh provide a ram because there was a need amen see God God had a need now you want to just look at God had a need because it's his word amen Isaac was the promised son amen and Abraham was getting ready to take that son out of existence so to speak and God had to keep his word so he provided himself amen he provided himself a sacrifice ain't that right see because the promise was in Isaac and so is it amen that the promise lays within us for we are God's promised children do you believe that amen see so God provided amen a sacrifice he provided himself a sacrifice for for his word's sake amen and then the prophet says now where did that Ram come from where where did it come from he says Abraham was a 100 miles or so away from civilization he was out you know on a mountain there was no water there was no streams there was no food amen for that Ram to eat and then then the Lions and the coyotes or whatever that was out there would have deved that that RAM and and all of these things amen but but he says the ram appeared on the scene in a crucial moment see it it appeared there and and and he says God created that Ram amen God spoke that Ram into existence see once again amen he he would have Abraham to go to where there was a totally impossible Amen to come up with some sacrifice amen Abraham had to stand totally holy upon what God told him to do amen and to honor what God and to believe God and to have faith in God and it was up to God to take care of it can you say amen and God did take care of it amen by providing his own speaking it into existence aren't you glad for that amen God keeps his word amen Psalms uh 46 And1 God is our refuge and strength a very present help in trouble amen therefore we will not fear amen though the Earth be removed and though the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea though the waters thereof Roar and be troubled though the mountains shake with the swelling thereof Sal there is a river the streams whereof shall make glad the city of God the holy place of the Tabernacles of the most high God is in the midst of her she shall not be moved can you say that with me I shall not be moved I shall not be moved why because because I voted a Republican or Democrat because my my money got money in the bank I got to find job I got to find house I got to find wife got to find children is that why I'm not going to be moved no God is in the midst of her a ain't that right see she shall not be moved God shall help her and that right early so to think of it because God chose us before the foundation of the world that we should be holy Without Blame before him and love because he fornew us and he called us and he predestinated us and he glorified us because he predestinated us to be conformed to the image of his own son then God himself had to find a way to secure us amen the promise lays within us can you say Amen you think of what he's done with this word and how he has protected this word amen to where they have burned it they have they have outlawed it they have done all kinds of stuff with this word but this word still exists now if he would do that for a Bible that is only printed amen and and and it gets falls apart and all these things how much more the word concerning you that he put within you can you say man he's going to protect that word he's going to protect that seed ain't that right amen see so so he he security though it's it's not going to be a temporal security amen but to provide an eternal security amen Paul would call it Eternal Redemption another thing Matthew 5:48 we have read it before but Jesus said be ye therefore perfect even as your father which is in heaven is perfect see so he it it was all already there it was his decree it was his will it was his desire so he had to find a way to make us perfect there's no way that none of us could be perfect and you're not to strive to be perfect in that sense amen God would make a way to bring this Perfection eternal security Eternal Redemption Eternal Perfection it does not start when we get on the other side into heaven when the devil's destroyed and all these things if if that is the case then we would have no place to rest our faith in uh uh if you know if if our security only started when we got to the other side and and and there's all the sickness and the sins and the corruption is destroyed then our Salvation our healing everything even in heaven it would just be left up to chance amen you know we we could you imagine and there's so many people that that live that way today that they they're doing everything that they can to make it but they have no security that they're going to make it wouldn't that be awful you you cannot have faith with that type of of belief how you going to do it then then your faith only goes into yourself if I'm good today then maybe you know I'm getting a little closer to heaven now you know but what about tomorrow when you fail what about you you living a a good for a year and then you you you you you you know you make that blunder you know a year from now and and then you you got to start back all over you understand what I'm saying it it's it's such a it keeps a person Topsy Turvy but see our going to heaven is not coincidental I the the changing of our body is not left to chance amen we've read this scripture many times um Jeremiah 29:11 for I know the thoughts that I think toward you sayith the Lord thoughts of peace and not of evil to give you an expected End Amen give you an expected end do you realize that it's his expectation for you to reach that end it was his expectation he's the one that that that put you amen and determined your end and he's under expectation now he's the one that's got to meet the need right can you say amen amen amen Psalms 37:23 the steps of a good man the righteous man are ordered of the Lord so there there's there's not it's this Christian life is not a chance amen it's it's you're you're not doing this by chance you ain't getting healed by chance you're not getting saved by chance you didn't come into this message by chance you ain't making it to Heaven by chance you n none of these things are by chance every promise of God is eternally secured to us do you believe that and we are eternally secured to them for Paul would even say I am persuaded that there's nothing amen that'll ever separate me from the love of God there's nothing that'll separate me from the promises of God Amen whatever God has given me as a promise they are mine by right and they are legally mine ain't that right I am eternally secure to them so see God had to provide something that would secure his promise that laid within us amen see and and you know uh God doesn't have to do anything but when he speaks his word then he is Duty bound to honor that word Lord amen he didn't have to choose us but he did it ain't that right so then he's Duty bound Amen to to to make that word come to pass oh if we could rest in that promised word tonight amen rest in who we are now Paul would tell us in in Hebrews 7: 19 the law made nothing perfect amen it it did not accomplish God's will in in what he predestinated us to be ain't that right but the bringing in of a better hope Christ did amen by the which we draw nigh unto God by the which we are changed from carnal to spiritual by the witch amen we we we we the World loses its hold on us and we are changed from glory to glory can you say amen amen why God provided something that the law could not do you see the law could not provide eternal security Eternal Redemption Perfection Eternal fellowship and Oneness with God it cannot do that you know and and and it did not have the strength enough to fulfill God's word in US in man it it just didn't do it it didn't have the strength to justify us it did not have the strength Amen to to uh uh uh call us out it did not have the strength to glorify us it it didn't have the strength to bring us to that expected end that God had for us amen the law could not do that ain't that right amen you see because the law was based on condition of what you did and what you you didn't do and and these things and and this is why God did not amen choose Abraham by law amen it was Grace that chose Abraham and he did not give the promise to Abraham by law under law ain't that right for Abraham and Sarah could not produce Isaac after the law he it just couldn't happen because they had not the ability to do it and the church cannot produce any promise of God under a law can you say amen that's right see amen so the Propet says you you can't no matter what you do you quit drinking quit smoking quit telling lies go to church try to do this and try to do that you're still carnal see that's just law the law makes nothing perfect but what makes perfect Christ see I might quit lying quit stealing committing adultery chewing quit all these things but I'm still carnal see God doesn't receive that because I have nothing to offer him in propitiation that's where the need was we needed something Amen to propitiate for us can you say Amen see through all of our goodness and all of our goodness and all of our goodness we're still carnal amen no matter how good you are and how perfect you are in in in your abilities and all these things you're still carnal ain't that right but here Romans 8 and3 three but for what the law could not do in that it was weak through the flesh amen because it was trying to perfect the flesh it couldn't perfect the soul it could not perfect God's word toward us God sending his own son in in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin or yeah for sin condemn sin in the flesh that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit aren't you glad for that now notice uh Hebrews 10 and 11 every priest standeth daily ministering and offering sometimes the same sacrifices which can never take away sins but this man this man this great high priest after he had offered one sacrifice for sins and we know what that sacrifice was it was himself amen offering up his own blood amen am amen forever see one sacrifice for sins he offered forever see sat down on the right hand of God from henceforth expecting till his enemies be made his foot stol for by one offering everybody say by one offering he have perfected forever them that are Sanctified God met the needs amen can you say Amen this is why when the when when tribulation is coming upon us that we know the wrath of God is coming amen the world knows what's happening the world is falling apart but we can rest knowing that God met the need he met the need amen for by one offering he hath perfected forever them that are sanctified whereof the Holy Ghost also is a witness to us for after that he said before this is the Covenant that I will make with him after those days sayith the Lord I will put my laws in their heart and in their minds will I write them and their sins and iniquities will I remember no more now you think of that God remembered his word concerning you do you you realize that Prophet said that God would take a picture of you before you ever were born he took a picture of you and that picture is always in his mind that picture is always before him and that picture does not he does not see a scarred individual he does not see the scarred Soul he does not see the scars in your body he doesn't see the torments and the past and all of these things there is a picture that he took of you and he'll never forget that picture he'll never forget that word through all the years and all the you you say well I haven't felt the Lord in so long he never will forget that picture he will never forget that word oh but you don't understand the trials that I'm going through it seemed like I'm just about to fall apart but God will never forget that word can you say Amen but he will forget your sins and iniquities because he was able to provide a need he was able to meet the need that way he get fellowship with you not as a sinner not as somebody that is so corrupt and a vagabond and worthy of death but now he has provided the need that he could fellowship with one that is righteous as he is because you you are now taken upon his righteousness therefore you're without sin and you can truly say what sin are you talking about I don't remember them hallelu think of that their sins and iniquities will I remember no more all right and now where remission of these is there's no more offering for sin praise the Lord he doesn't need to keep dying for you it's done it's done can you say that with me it's done it's done yes sir you don't need to do Penance it's done having therefore Brethren boldness everybody say boldness now notice this is the result of Calvary this is the result of the need being met we needed someone to perpetuate for us to God God would Supply that need by becoming man and being not he he became our lamb ain't that right became sin for us us amen now he becomes our our our high priest ain't that right man if if that doesn't bring and magnify the love of God to us I I don't know what it will but because of these things and because he's able to demolish the sin we are now commanded to go therefore boldly enter into the holiest by the blood everybody say by the blood by the blood of Jesus aren't you glad for that by a New and Living Way way which he hath consecrated set aside for us through the veil that is to say his flesh and having and having an high priest over the house of God let us because we have a high priest because we have someone that is ever interceding for us brother Brown said as long as there's a need for a high priest there will be a high priest can you say amen and other words his his office does not end and the blood run out and now you're left you was saved and now you're you're you're here in in the most needful time in the most time that you need a body change and you're needing all that but now the blood's run out and they're ain't enough power to to to you know and you don't know what you're going to do it that that ain't it at all can you say amen amen see having an high priest over the house of God and we know we have that high priest let us draw near amen uh with a True Heart everybody say A True Heart in full Assurance of faith having our heart sprinkled from an evil conscience and our bodies washed with pure water notice let us everybody say let us hold fast our profession let us hold fast our confession I'm going to get into more of that uh next next week or so let us hold fast our profession the profession of our faith without wavering for he is faithful that promis are you Faithful amen no it wasn't me I I fell all the time brother BR said we backslide every day and I'm so glad to hear a prophet say that amen that we we backslide and and and the moment we sin and and when we sin we it's not sin yet when we fall it's not sin yet because the moment you see that you done wrong you'll repent of it can you say Amen so it's not based upon our faithfulness he is the one that is faithful that promised he was faithful to Abraham he was faithful to David he was faithful to Eve he was faithful Amen to marry he was faithful everyone that he would give a promise to he proved himself faithfulness in their weakness he remained faithful and so is he today amen glory brother Braham said once in the presence of God recognizing that we could never stand there only through the merits of Jesus Christ then we draw nigh unto God through the merits of his son amen Lord I come to you with an innocent heart in in the in the in the name of thy son Jesus please receive me oh brother you're coming by a living way then not Lord you know I quit drinking you know I treat my wife right and you know I do this and do that you have nothing to offer can you say Amen so see the law of carnal commandment doesn't put you in better standing with God it doesn't give you anything to offer to God Amen see so so so how can anything be offered to to God except through the great high priest and how can he offer anything but blood which would be his own blood amen see so so he offers to God no other blood but his own ain't that right and we know through through Abel amen that that that this Blood amen Paul speaks about it in Hebrews that this blood which is a creative blood God's own blood speaks of better things than abble blood ain't that right amen now Abel's blood was the blood of the old Covenant Old Testament this Blood amen that redeems us is the blood of the New Testament a ain't that right and so it's a far greater blood than Abel's blood amen and and and so this is God's created blood whereas Abel's was sex blood sinful blood and and all these things and notice Abel's blood cried out for Revenge yes ain't that right Abel's blood cried out for Revenge just imagine if if if they would have taken uh uh some some righteous man and and and hung him on the cross like they' done Jesus for our remissions and and all these things yet that blood would cry out for Revenge it would want revenge can you say well Abel's blood did it it cried out for Revenge can you sayen it spoke of guilt and death and sorrow the prophet said see and and and that blood did not not speak on Abel or on Cain's behalf but rather sought Vengeance amen if there was no intercession through that blood ain't that right see and the Bible says that Cain went from the presence of the Lord amen but when Christ died amen we were already from the presence of the Lord but now because of that righteous blood because of that Holy creative blood being offered to God and it's speaking of better things the prophet said it speaks of redemption it speaks of Joy it speaks of healing it speaks of of Fellowship it it it it speaks of all the promises of God that you're aired to that blood is speaking on your behalf amen and it's drawing you into the presence of God CU it's not seeking revengeance can you say amen amen all do you love him amen it speaks for us it speaks for us that blood speaks for us right amen and so by that blood God himself became our great high priest Lord and by his blood his own blood God can fulfill his word in you can you say amen he couldn't do it by the blood of an animal couldn't do it by just blood of a sinful man sinful blood amen but he created the blood amen he met a need can you say amen amen when you think of it there was no blood on the Earth Could That Could That Could wipe our sins away there there was no blood powerful enough amen that could atone for our sins and bring us back into reconciliation we were same in the same spot that that that that Abraham was on the mountain up there when he needed a sacrifice and there was no sacrifice around what are you going to do well what are we going to do can you say Amen but in the in the time that there was a need God provided that need and created and his own his his own blood Hebrews 7:11 uh through 18 says if therefore Perfection were by the levitical priesthood for under it the people received the law what further need was that there be another Pro priest that should rise after the order of MDC and not be called after the order of Aaron for the priest being priesthood being changed there was is made of necessity a change also of the law for he of whom these things are spoken pertaineth to another tribe of which no man gave attendance to at the altar for it is evidence that our Lord sprang out of Judah of which tribe Moses spake nothing concerning priesthood what a surprise that God's able to meet the need and it is yet far more evident for that after the similitude of MDC there ariseth another priest who is made not after everybody say not after the law of a carnal commandment but after the power of an endless life amen for he testifieth that thou art a priest Forever After the order of MDC for there is verily a dising of the Commandment going before for the weakness and unprofitableness thereof there was weakness in the law it was unprofitable can you say Amen see but where did this high priest come from out of the tribe of Judah not out of Levi ofi brother BR says they were they were legalist that tribe of Levi they they they they they that lineage their their priesthood they they were they were carnal legalists but here he's not made after the law of carnal commandment in legalist law could not produce him ain't that right see the law said Thou shalt not kill Thou shalt not steal Thou shalt not commit adultery Thou shalt not do this and this and this and that see and and then Here Comes Jesus there in Matthew 2 5:28 and I but I say unto you you know that whosoever lookth upon a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her in his heart already see so brother BR says see there you are that ought to teach women how to dress and how to do what's right you dress wrong cause men to look at you in in the wrong way you're guilty of committing adultery just the same as you went through the ACT Jesus said so ain't that right but Christ is not made after the the carnal law or the the the law of of carnal commandment and I and I want to say to you tonight that that the neither is the elect the elect of God is not made after a carnal commandment can you say man they they tried to they tried to do it see carinal commandment see brother BR says see that's legal old brother I shouldn't I shouldn't I know see but that's not it see it's love that does it everybody say it's love that does it see how how how we went through it see he said see if I said about my wife oh I'd like to have two wives I'd like to run around with this one and do this one there and all that but but if I do my wife will divorce me and my kids will see then my Ministry be lost and all that he said you dirty rotten hypocrite that's right see you don't love her right in the first place that's exactly right if you loved her there'll be no law about it amen can you say Amen there'd be no law about it see you'd love her anyhow you you you and and you stick with her that's exactly right and you women will do the same thing to your husband that's right he said see sometime women become to a place and he's a man see some little Jezebel all painted up and you know he'll go out around and fall for her maybe a good wife you know and and then you call yourself a Christian shame on you you need another dose of the altar see see so so so you know i' I've been where you know uh uh and and I'll get ready to close but the uh apostolics that we they didn't they didn't believe in television either but a lot of them snuck them in their homes you know as long as the pastor didn't know you know that way they we get preach that and and these things but see that's the law of carnal Commandments if you're doing something by law if it just becomes law Church coming coming to church just becomes a law to you it's if if serving the lord just becomes a law if Holiness just becomes a law to us then then there's something wrong you understand what I'm saying I I don't think that the the the preacher has to keep preaching against sin and and sin and sin and sin and sin and you know if if there's a people that really fall in love with God then that sin question is over with ain't that right then then then you start walking with God on your own uh two feet so to speak and and and then you leave the the the the the principles the basics and then you move on up into Perfection you know I mean by now we we should know you know that that women don't cut hair and all that but you know there's a lot of folks that ain't got that Revelation even though they do have long hair but they'll trim it they'll do everything they can they'll burn the ends or they'll do this just to get Slide by and get away with it and all these things but but see it's is a law of carnal commandment God's bride is not made up that way God's bride is not made up well I I'll just go out and wear my shorts as long as so certain so the the big mouth of the church don't know and all that then then I'll be just fine see that way the whole church won't know it's a law of carnal Commandments can you say man it it's just the truth anyways so so see the legalist law makes Hypocrites it does not make bride it does not produce a perfected heart amen it just makes it just makes Hypocrites out of the people ain't that right but see there's only one that can make us perfect and that is Christ and he is made after amen the power of an endless life amen and so is the church the church is made after the same material and that is the power of an endless life amen that's exactly right Hallelujah Hebrews 7 and 20 it says in in as much as not without an oath he was made priest in other words he couldn't have been made priest without an oath but there was an oath that that went with this ain't that right see for those priests that levitical priesthood ironic priesthood was made without an oath amen but this priest this great high priest amen see with an oath by him that said unto him the Lord swear and will not repent amen aren't you glad for that bless the Lord the Lord swear and would not repent thou art a priest Forever After the order of MDC amen see the difference the levitical priesthood they didn't it wasn't an oath that put him in there it wasn't Divine uh uh God swearing right that this was going to be amen because if it was that way then the levitical priesthood would continue ain't that right but brother Bri said see this the priest of the levitical priesthood come down through generations go to school learn to be preachers and so forth they come down God made them priests like that see they made themselves priests by their education by their inheritance and so forth like that ain't that right and and the carnal church has made itself thus right it's existing without an oath good think about it ain't that right right but we're not as that carnal Church understand there's a lot of churches out there but but but many are existing with without an oath can you say Amen there's a lot claiming Christianity but many are existing without an oath all right we see a lot of preachers claiming to be preachers ain't preachers lick amen hello no anointing behind it no nothing pre all right maybe someone just told them they ought to go out and preach or had a dream or something that they should be preaching or whatever but there's no confirmation am can you say Amen well that's the same way with anything you see people come in and then they go and then you get you get saved and then they're they're back out doing the same old things and and all that that there there there was something see it's without an oath can you say Amen but Christ Our great high priest was a priest that was made by an oath ain't that right right and and and Paul would tell us the word of the oath maketh the son hello that's what he said in Hebrews the word of the oath is what made the Son and the word of God's predestinated oath made the church come on that's right praise the Lord you believe it yes sir amen so brother Brown said the law could not produce nothing like that because it was carnal the church cannot produce nothing like that denominations the denominations because they are carnal the seminaries can never produce anything like that they try to educate the world to it they try to organize it uh uh it to it they tried every way in the world to make everything that they could and leaving off the main thing you got to be born again amen God makes you what you are thank you hello God makes you what you are he said see it's certainly he says not because you quit doing this he said now the nazarenes you you you you you won't wear a ring you can't wear a watch you have to have certain certain things your arms have to be this long the sleeves your skirts has to be so long yeah the men can't belong to a lodge they won't baptize you if you don't see and he says see here then here comes the Catholics in and they have theirs here comes the Methodist and they have theirs every one of them has a yard stick to measure up to see but you don't make it see they ain't made the church yet amen oh my because they can't it's got to take God to supply the need you see why God would send a profit in this age it would take God to send the prophet to restore us back to the faith TR that's good they've tried it they've done all these things he said but the real thing of it is is nothing in my arms I bring simply to thy cross I cling oh God naked wounded need sucker see he said oh I most humbly come Christ confessing that I am nothing and there's nothing Within Me receive me oh God then God receives you now you might not even know your ABCs you might not know coffee from split peas you might know not know G from hall right from the left hand see it don't make any difference what you don't know there's one thing you must know is that Jesus Christ took your place as a sinner Hallelujah and you take your place to stand in his righteousness confessing every day that you're wrong and love him with all your heart your whole motives be set towards him you'll make Heaven that's all there is to it for the life that was in Christ has to be in you or you're lost all right can you say Amen do you love him amen he made us he made us church that's good and not only did it do it for our our soul but he done it for your body he made you heal he made you well he he made you what you are he made you the head and not the tail he hath made us and not we ourselves amen can you sayen and with this the power of an endless life it's all within you and the same spirit that raised him from the dead if that Spirit dwell in you it'll also Quicken your mortal bodies can you say amen amen and as he conquered you'll conquer amen as he overcome you going to overcome oh my that relationship that he had that Oneness that he had with the father now it is us because he suppli the need anything that you have need of you can go to him and ask him amen and he'll give it to you Lord bless you love him amen I hope it's helped you it's the musicians will come praise the Lord that's good oh the Lord is so good amen so good to us I'm so glad that God determined to fulfill his word that he didn't forget it but he made the way that Satan could never I don't care what Satan produced and what he had to offer and and come up with and we were his pawns but it would never make God forget his word about us amen but God said there's a need so he met the need to where he would forget our sins and our trespasses aren't you glad for that Hallelujah I love the Lord oh we better start all over well and now I sing there we go a brand new song Amazing Grace all day long Christ Jesus Paid a Debt that I could never pay sing it again He Paid a Debt he did not owe I owed a debt that I could not pay oh we needed
