stays in the room a lot so you know but uh they've been working on some projects but anyway it's certainly good to have them and uh sister Mindy and the girls as well and good to see that they're they're feeling better brother Amos and sister Lisa glad to have you back and trust you had some good Services there and amen and um if you have your Bibles we're going to turn to the book of Hebrews the 4th chapter 14th verse amen the Lord is certainly good to us am and I trust he's been good to you amen well I know he's been good to you I just trust you know that God is always good to us amen and uh he's good to the uh the worst sinner sister Bonnie good to have you back praise the Lord and uh just always good to God's people amen uh the book of Hebrews the uh fourth uh chapter and um we're going to start at the 14th verse but it says seeing then that we have a great high priest that has passed into the heavens Jesus the son of God let us hold fast our profession for we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with the filling of our infirmities but was in all points tempted like as we are yet without sin so let us come let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace that we may find obtain mercy and find Grace to help in the time of need amen then if you'll turn to the book of Hebrews the 10th chapter the 10th chapter and um let's see here um 21st verse and having an high priest over the house of God let us draw near with a True Heart in full Assurance of Faith having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience and our bodies washed with pure water let us hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering for he is faithful that promise amen let's just bow our heads and talk to our Lord father indeed you are worthy you have shown that you're worthy in this age Lord to loose the seals thereof father to show that you have redeemed us and you're claiming now that Redemption uh that work Lord uh the sub objects of your Redemption and Lord we're just thankful to be part of it and we're just asking now that you would Minister to US minister to every need anoint both speaker and hearer is our prayer those that are uh not able to make it whether it's sickness or out of town traveling we pray that you would keep them Father heal them and Lord uh just ask your anointing would be upon both speaker and hearer we ask it in Jesus Christ's name amen you can have your seats this evening and um I guess the title that I would have was we have a great high priest and um you know the Bible tells us without faith it is impossible to please God then Jesus tells us that all things are possible to them that believe so faith of course uh is is as we know is essential um for us in the Christian walk and God God wants us to believe in him he wants us to believe his word and uh but as the prophet told us that faith faith must have something solid to rest upon uh and so we're not just uh uh resting in our faith in anything uh uh for there's nothing solid outside the word of God um uh there just nothing solid outside of God uh God is eternal his word is eternal God and His word is the same for he is the word ain't that right he is all powerful therefore his word is all powerful he is supreme his word is supreme he will never be defeated and his word will never be defeated and and so you we to have faith in God we'd have to have faith in his word to have faith in his word we'd have to have faith in God uh you you can't separate the the the two uh because God never does anything outside of his own word amen and so this is why it's so important that we know the word of God and believe the word of God because God whatever the word of God says amen that's what God does he backs it up and and so uh therefore our our faith uh uh is resting upon the word of God God manifests himself uh through and by his his word but faith cannot rest in anything natural it it uh faith cannot rest in in natural man it cannot rest in natural works of man it cannot rest in the knowledge of natural men faith it it cannot rest in the natural life of a man uh or or an animal it cannot rest in the natural blood of a man or or an animal uh Faith must rest in God and God Alone ain't that right and so then when we look at Christ uh Jesus Christ was none other than God himself uh manifested In the Flesh the Bible says that the fullness of God uh was uh dwelt in him bodily amen so then our faith can rest in Jesus Christ that's that's where our faith is for the Bible says every promise in him is yay and amen it's it's it's it's something that is solid um and and the Bible says that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever so there he's got that Eternal quality for he was godm made flesh ain't that right amen so so uh uh then we we find that the Apostle Paul uh uh tells us that Jesus Christ is our high priest and and which which means that God became our high priest uh in his own human body uh Christ Jesus ain't that right amen 2 Corinthians 5:18 and all things are of God uh who hath reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ and ha given to us the ministry of reconciliation to it that God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself amen God became flesh amen Jesus Christ is none other than God a ain't that right and so uh uh then God became the true sacrifice in Christ Jesus God became the true altar in Jesus Christ God became the true door Amen in Jesus Christ God um uh became the living bread in Jesus Christ everything that that Christ that we see the manifestation of Christ amen God was that in Jesus Christ amen so then our faith can rest Amen in in Christ Jesus and his work of reconciliation because it wasn't just a man bringing reconciliation it was God in Christ reconciling the world to himself ain't that right amen so then this reconciliation is true it's a it's a sure thing because God will never fail whatever God does it's it's their uh uh it's it's Everlasting amen so in the Old Testament God uh types uh um himself um or spoke of himself in types and shadows amen it's prophetic of what God would do in Christ Jesus and and the prophet said God never asked a man to do anything him uh anything or something that he wouldn't do himself and and so then when we we look at at what men done and what God had men to do in the Old Testament it was only to show what God was going to do in uh uh himself in Christ Jesus amen so uh uh in the Old Testament for example Aaron uh uh the brother of Moses uh was ordained of God to be a high priest amen and and you you you can read that there in Exodus 40 and13 and uh uh but the name Aaron means very high amen that's the meaning of Aaron very high and and he he stood Supreme as the high priest um very high above his own house and and exalted uh uh Of course house is family amen but uh and and he was exalted above the people in that he was the position that he held it it was a high priest and and Aaron as as that be he was the type of of Jesus Christ what God would be in Jesus Christ and uh the Bible says that Jesus Christ was exalted to the right hand of the father and and so if if you notice that Jesus is called the high priest but he's not just high priest but but Paul would call him the great high priest amen and and which which means that he would it it showed his superiority even above Aaron Aaron had superiority over the people of isra Israel in in in his office and over his family but Jesus was the greater than than Aaron he was the greater of all priests ain't that right so he is the great high priest for for God become high priest in Christ Jesus amen and so uh uh but but we find that that Aaron amen uh uh God uh ordaining him to be in that office of high priest it means that he was to be a mediator uh an intercessor between God and his people and and so I I looked up that word mediator it is one who intervenes between two either in order to make or restore peace and friendship or form a compact or for ratifying a covenant a medium of communication uh an arbitrator amen so uh uh this is what God was was wanting amen between the people uh with Aaron uh between the people of Israel and God there would be a high priest and that would be Aaron that would Medi mediate and and intercede and and between God and the people a mediator also is to act as a mediator between leg um uh lit litigating uh uh or coveting parties uh there to accomplish something by interposing between two parties to mediate so so the Bible says that the high priest uh was um he he was to offer sacrifices and gifts to God on behalf of the people to bring reconciliation now you think of that that that this was all in God's plan and and again he wouldn't ask a man to do it if he wasn't going to do it himself but God would show through types and Shadow is of what he had in mind so now of of Christ it is said in in Hebrews 2:17 wherefore in all things it behooved him to be made like unto his Brethren a aen amen that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in the things pertaining to God to make reconciliation for the sins of the people aren't you glad for that amen see so peace and fellowship between man and God shows that a Reconciliation had had been made amen but if you notice in the Old Testament that the high priest could not make intercession uh uh uh without the shedding of blood amen according to Hebrews 13:11 the the blood of animals was brought into the sanctuary uh by the high priest for sin so this is what the high priest would do Slay Slay the animal and and then he would offer up that blood take that blood and enter into the the the the the sanctuary Amen to offer up uh to the people as and mediate between the people and God and so it it the high priest uh had to be anointed in order to go in and then he had to take amen the blood of that animal or he would die he'd have to take that with him amen or or he would perish amen so that tells us that there can be no intercession without blood it takes blood amen for there to be an intercessor ain't that right amen blood is the only thing that will appease God Amen is is and we find that even with Cain when he offered up uh his own uh uh uh from The Works of the ground and what he had planted and things and and and he offered that to God but it was rejected and but yet God would receive abble sacrifice because there was blood on the altar ain't that right amen see so in 2 Chronicles 29 and 23 it says they brought forth the heig goats for the sin offering before the king and the congregation and they laid their hands upon them and the priest killed them and they made reconciliation with their blood upon the altar to make an atonement for all Israel now we we know this uh we talked about it before but I'm going to go into it just a little bit amen but why does it take blood why is there there has to be blood in order for there be to be reconciliation now we want reconciliation with God and God is the only one that knows what it will take for man to be reconciled unto him ain't that right and so through again through the types and shadows amen we could study it and we could look and how that God would never allow a high priest just to go in amen and and mediate without there being a a blood that was shed amen well when man partook of the knowledge of the tree of Good and Evil amen he was separated from God and there was a gap aen between him and God and and and not really just not a natural Gap so to speak but his his understanding and his his his well the holy nature of man uh of God uh Le the holy image of God left man when he had sinned and so he become carnal in his nature and he was separated from his fellowship with God he couldn't understand God couldn't couldn't know God aen you give him a Bible and he would never understand it he he just didn't understand he couldn't even even understand by Nature anymore and and God through nature because his his his he was so separated and he he was separated from the life of God and the prophet said that when he fail it it brought death to his soul amen see and so uh in Genesis 2 and 17 God said to man in the day that thou eatest amen uh uh th th shalt surely die amen that thou shalt die and and and then in Romans 5 And1 12 Paul said wherefore as by one man sin entered into the world and death by sin so death passed upon all men for that all have sinned ain't that right so then you find even in the New Testament it talks about how that we were all uh dead in sins and in trespasses so so sin brought death amen and and and so and and of course death as we talked brother Brown tells us death represents is it means uh separation if you die physically then you're separated from those that are alive here on this Earth you're separated from your family your loved ones and and and if you die spiritually if there's a spiritual death then you you're separated from God your very own Creator ain't that right amen so so uh God would tell him you know the day you eat this the day you're going to die amen and and and and that was when he was cut off the separation and and of course that death wasn't only speaking of of spiritual death in which we were separated from God but it also speaks of physical death amen see When sin entered into the world then disease and and sickness entered into the world and and as F bef Bosworth said that disease is aient of is aient death in other words it is death beginning to set in when diseases and sickness and it it just lets us know that death amen uh uh is is present and and and uh uh it is the reality of death and and so the physical death and spiritual death is the result of of sin of what man done in in the beginning ain't that right and so every man has tried to escape death they have they have tried to reconcile themselves to a peace that they once known amen they have tried to recogn uh reconcile themselves to the joy that man once knew they tried to reconcile themselves to their creator a man that that they once had fellowship with and they they try everything they they have even tried to reconcile themselves Amen to living again and and they're trying to live young you know you everyone's trying to find that that way of life and to to where they could live uh uh longer and stay young and and all of these things and and so that has been the desire of man is to make life better and and these things and and so but but they've never been able to find the joy that that once that they were separated from they've never been able to find the peace that they were separated from they've never been F able to find the contentment and and all of these things because they're spiritually dead a ain't that right see man cannot have fellowship with his creator while he is spiritually dead now I I thought you know uh uh when we think of it uh how sin has affected Us in so many ways in a a man man is a Triune being he's Body Spirit and soul amen so then sin didn't just affect uh uh the soul of man but it affected the Triune being of man the the the whole of man body spirit and and soul ain't that right his entire being and and and I just believe that man was not only made to live eternally in his soul but I believe that he was made to live eternally in his body as as well for you you you see your soul is what you are but but you'll never be without a body amen it's uh uh for God put you in in in uh your body ain't that right and so man cannot be complete without soul body and spirit ain't that right and and and so then uh uh then then sin if sin can affect us in our body and can affect affect us in our spirit and our soul then God can surely come up with a remedy to restore not only our soul but to restore our body and to restore our spirit and and and and these things but we find that that right after man fell God uh uh uh sought um and and revealed his desire to reconcile man and again he and and and and scriptures all in this Bible tells us that that and shows us that God determined to not just reconcile the soul of man but he would reconcile the the the whole Triune being of man body Soul and Spirit and and so but in order to bring this reconciliation he had to take away sin amen he had to take away that sin ain't that right because see reconciliation is to bring back Fellowship between man and God reconciliation is to bring back uh uh wholeness Amen in the man to where he can talk to God and and have that peace and have that joy and have that everything that he fell from and lost that is to be reconciled back ain't that right so he has to take away the sin amen see and and and so when sin is taken away death has no more power over us amen when he can take away the sin spiritual death physical death it has no part over us anymore aren't you glad for that amen see so amen and and we know that he not only redeemed our soul but he redeemed our body as well amen but but get rid of the sin God had to get rid of the sin as as we said you know uh if you if you're fighting you know let's just say a bear and the bear has come out uh against you uh you know it ain't going to do you any good just to cut off its Paul amen you know uh uh cuz it can still fight amen the best thing to do is knock it in the head and and when you knock it in the head you you've knocked out all the paws you've knocked out everything amen see you've killed the whole body ain't that right so God sought for a remedy to knock sin in the head amen and destroy that thing once and for all over man kind a ain't that right so so 1 John 3 and5 the Bible says you know that he was manifested Amen to take away our sin and in him is no sin so that is why Jesus Christ was manifested is to take away sin take away our sins and our unbelief ain't that right when sin is taken away then whatever sin affected can now uh uh be delivered and restored unto us amen the power of sin loses its hold amen and now we're back to re restoration but there had to be an atonement Amen in order for man to be reconciled see so so the atonement would be the thing that would kill sin amen and destroy that thing utterly amen now I thought about that word atonement means to make amends for wrongdoing or guilt it's it's a Reconciliation in the Old Testament the word atone means to cover amen so God knew God had already purposed in his mind what he was going to do to to break the power of sin he was going to produce an atonement ain't that right amen he was going to produce that amen see and so uh uh uh in in Genesis 3:15 uh God talking to the serpent foretold of the atonement uh for man he said I will put imity between thee and the woman and between thy seed and her seed and it shall bruise thy head and thou shalt bruise his heel amen the prophet said see bruising his heel showing that there would be Affliction to the church but he promised Triumph ain't that right but but the woman seed would would bruise the Serpent's head amen uh and and the prophet said bruise means to make an atonement amen God would make an atonement and that atonement would kill and knock Satan in the head ain't that right amen see and so then we find that Satan has constantly he constantly watched for that seed and sought to destroy it amen he's looked for it all through the Old Testament and looked for it amen up to Jesus's time and and trying to destroy that that seed that would bruise his head amen see now uh uh until that seed came that seed didn't come right automatically but until that seed God provided a temporary propitiation amen uh uh for for us aren't you glad for that amen amen and he shows what it would be everything that we see it's in Genesis three and six and when woman saw that the tree was good for food that it was pleasant to the eyes and a tree to be desired to make one wise she took of the fruit thereof and did eat and go and gave also un to her husband with her and he did eat and the eyes of them both uh uh were open and they knew that they were naked notice what they done and they solded fig leaves together and made themselves aprons now we know it was a self-made covering amen again uh uh they were doing trying to do it without God's help ain't that right amen they they were trying to do it to where God wouldn't recognize their condition amen see and and and so uh the Bible there eighth verse and they heard the voice of the Lord God uh Walking In The Garden in the cool of the day and Adam and his wife hid them eles the thing that they thought would help them meet God's presence meet him amen when he they started to come in condemnation hit them and they ran and hid from the presence of the Lord among the Trees of the garden so the prophet said see Adam tried to have a super religion amen without blood see and atonement for his sins ain't that right that the the Fig leaves couldn't be an atonement for sins amen only the blood could be an atonement see so they're covering that super religion that they tried it couldn't take away the condemnation from them and as long as they were condemned they couldn't come boldly into the presence of God ain't that right and and and notice the sin their conversations changed their attitude changed the their confidence was taken away all of these things but then God in his Mercy amen would provide an atonement would provide a covering for them there in Genesis 3:21 and Adam also and to his wife did the Lord God make coats of skin and clothe them ain't that right it showed there that God created something he I I I know that the the the we know that the fall of Adam was not a mistake amen uh God knew it it it it it wasn't you know going to SL didn't slip God's mind it didn't come and surprise God God had already provided a way to cover amen Adam and Eve you think of that he took what he had already created he didn't have to create something new it was already there amen God knew what he would do and he took that lamb a a skin he slew that lamb and clothed them with the skin of that lamb which was a proof amen that the blood had been shed for an atonement for his children he covered them with the bloody skin of the lamb and the prophet says let's look through that window and he says I see them running through the garden and blood dripping amen as that the Skins flapping against their legs and the blood dripping it was a bloody lamb ain't that right it was a bloody covering it was a bloody skin amen yes sir now the prophet said see the church wants to perform through their Creeds amen and see how many members they can get but God wants to perform through the power of the blood amen see to get Christians born again you can't do anything without the blood it takes the blood aren't you glad for the blood amen that would cover us now in in in Exodus uh 30 and 10 it says and Aaron shall make an atonement upon the horns of it once in a year with the blood of the sin offering of atonements he shall make an atonement this is what the high priest was going to do as the mediator amen between God and the people he would be the one to make make the atonement amen and bring the blood before the Lord now so why was the blood required Amen to answer this and and uh uh hopefully uh I can we can make some sense with it but uh Exodus 21 and 23 uh starting there and if any Mischief follows then Thou shalt give Life For Life eye for eye tooth for tooth hand for hand foot for for foot burning for burning wound for wound stripe for stripe amen so this is the law of God life for life ain't that right in other words Blood for Blood amen see so uh God required blood now now people say well that the sin in the garden they they say it was the fruit you know a Eve ate an apple and or you know apricot or or whatever and and and so they they've got this idea that it was that that she her and Adam partook of a literal fruit from a literal fruit tree amen and and uh uh then if if that be the case then it would have to be eye for eye Blood for Blood tooth for tooth then then Redemption would come by eating an apple or or an apricot or or some fruit amen see but but that's not the case as we know for God told man to multiply and replenish the earth and the law of God was that every seed was to bring forth of its kind well Adam was the spoken word of God Amen and he was to bring forth of his kind ain't that right so he was to bring forth spoken word children amen and and uh he was a created son he was not a begotten son like Jesus was the Bible says of Christ that he was the only begotten son of God but Adam was the spoken word Son of God ain't that right Jesus come through the womb of uh a virgin womb amen so so Adam was to bring forth Sons like unto himself which would be by the spoken word of God but instead of doing that he brought forth a perverted life amen and that by sex so it was sex blood that brought forth that perverted life amen and and so when Adam sinned he fell from his position he fell from uh Authority he had no power he was just a carnal man uh uh couldn't speak to the winds he couldn't he ran you know to find shelter and and and all of these things and so he had not the power within him to fulfill the word of God for now he had died amen that death had began to set in amen and the holy image of God had left him so he could not bring forth were children because of his Fallen condition and he took upon himself a sinful nature ain't that right so instead of us being born as sons of God we were born as sons of Adam amen with having that adamic nature and the Bible says that all have sinned and and come short of the glory of God ain't that right amen it says that we all were born in sin shaping in iniquity and or or conceived in sin and speaking lies and and all of these things and we all have the uh that that old adamic nature ain't that right so the Bible says by one man sin entered into the world and death by sin and so death passed upon all men amen see so it it if we could say it this way it was was blood that took man out of the garden amen see it was blood that separated man from God it was sex blood can you say Amen sex life and and and these things so in order to reconcile man to back to God and to bring him to eternal life blood had to be shed amen blood had to be shed amen and in Hebrews 9 and 22 without the shedding of blood there is no remission ain't that right you know it it's somehow that you know we we talk about uh uh uh denominations and things but a lot of them are taking the blood out of their song books they've taken the blood out of everything anymore they built it around programs they built it around a lot of things amen but the problem is is there is no remission for sins without the blood there is no reconciliation back to God without the blood ain't that right see so then uh no remission and and that word remission means Deliverance pardon Freedom amen Liberty amen there is no Deliverance without blood no pardon with no liberty no no no nothing without the blood amen so there had to be life taken in order for the blood to be shed amen and and life had to be taken in order for the power of death spiritually and physically to be broken ain't that right now uh Leviticus 17 And1 says the life of the flesh is in the blood and he says I have given it to you uh uh God speaking upon the altar to make an atonement for your souls for it is the blood that maketh an atonement for the soul the life of the flesh is in the blood ain't that right amen see so the Life In The Blood amen and and so uh we we find that that uh uh brother Bram says Abel by Revelation knew that it was blood that took them out of the garden it was sex blood that took them out and and so he said see by faith Abel saw that it was sex blood see the blood cell comes from the male the blood has or the man has the blood cell in the sperm and the hogl is is the blood comes through the mail and Abel knowed that it wasn't apples peaches potatoes or whatever it was that brought them out of the Garden of Eden that caused the sin it was sex blood and he offered blood back can you say amen he saw that it was a sexual Affair Through Blood and another place brother Braham says life doesn't lay in Plants it lays in blood so blood had to be offered as a substitute because the Bloods where the life laid and God required life at sin can you say Amen so then sin's judgment is to take life life for life amen see and so then we find that the blood that the high priest brought before the Lord showed that life had been taken as a substitute for mankind so then then that that that that man uh uh Aaron and the priest after him in his lineage amen they had a natural blood of an animal amen and and brought it before God but they had to keep doing that every year doing it every year because that blood was not sufficient enough to reconcile man back to God Amen uh uh and so there had to be it was only a covering or if you could say it rode their sins ahead it just you know and and when man left amen the the worshipper left amen uh to go back home he was still a sinner he was still whatever he was he was still under that curse of sin a ain't that right still had that old nature in all of them things but see so we also find that not only the the high priest had to have blood to go in to mediate but the worshipper had to have blood amen he had to have that lamb uh the prophet said that he had to lay his hands upon his sacrifice and as the priest was slic it slit that throat and and the the the the the lamb the life of that lamb was leaving its body blood was squirting everywhere as and it was getting all over all over that that worshipper amen because he he had to be identified that was the only way amen is when the blood of that sacri rice came up on the believer amen then it showed he was identified with his sacrifice in other words he couldn't just say okay here priest I'm going to give you this and I'll be back in an hour let see if it all went okay no no no he had to be right there amen wherever the blood was he had to be amen for that blood to come back upon him can you say Amen now now this was a precious thing Amen to them because they wanted to have fellowship with God Amen they they they wanted to appease God and and so it was a precious thing amen that when God would would Institute this a high priest with blood and a sacrifice with blood Amen to where they could be covered Amen in The Exodus first Exodus uh the children of Israel had to paint the blood of of the Lamb upon the doorpost literal blood had to be literal shown public display amen and they had to get under the blood they had to be under the blood in order for the the death angel to pass them by because if the death angel saw that there was no blood amen then he could have power to to put death in that home ain't that right see so the prophet said see the the blood identified that the worshipper had slain the lamb and accepted the lamb see the worshipper accepted the lamb see uh uh uh he had he he had he had faith in that lamb he had had faith in that blood that lamb and it showed the blood being upon him that he had accepted the sacrifice see and applied the token to himself that he was not ashamed he wasn't ashamed of that blood he wasn't ashamed of that atonement he wasn't ashamed of his sacrifice see amen he didn't care who saw it he wanted everybody to see it it was placed in such a position that everybody passing by could see that token aren't you glad for that amen see and so could you imagine the high priest being ashamed of his sacrifice could you imagine if that high priest was ashamed and and didn't really believe in the power of the blood amen and says forget that you don't have to you don't have to have a lamb let's just try it on our own no if I was that worshiper i' tell that high priest oh no no no we want blood in this thing we want blood in our religion ain't that right amen we want blood see but we find that the blood of the animal it it was not sufficient to redeem us back to God it was a lower life than what was required amen for the the blood the life uh that flows in the blood of an animal uh it's just animal life amen and so uh it it doesn't match the human life it had no soul so it its life couldn't come back upon the worshipper so the worshipper went away still contaminated with perverted life amen and so the sin was still there because of the life being contaminated amen and and so the prophet said see the reason the animal life couldn't give them the Holy Ghost is because the animal the life that was in that animal when that life was taken it was just animals life and it would not coincide to the human life because the animal has not not a soul ain't that right so it could not come back upon on the on on the worshipper it just was there for a temporary covering but everything that was being done in the Old Testament was only pointing to something else greater that's true God would be something perform something greater and he would do it himself ain't that right amen so so Hebrews 10:1 says for the law having a shadow of good things to come not the very image of the things can never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually it can never make the comers there unto perfect for then would they had not have ceased uh to be offered see uh uh because that the worshippers once purged should have no more conscience of sins but in those sacrifices there is a remembrance again made of sins each year for it is not possible everybody say it's not possible that the blood of animals and of goat should take away sins where wherefore when he cometh into the world he says sacrifice and offering thou wouldest not but a body thou Hast prepared me God would prepare himself a body ain't that right and in that body he would fulfill it all so he says see in burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin thou Hast had no pleasure for it was only a temporary solution ain't that right and yet so it it could not be by animal blood that would would would reconcile man Even though God would allow that to be temporarily used until the true seed came until that perfect lamb came but then also we could not be reconciled by human blood amen amen see sex blood it that that wasn't powerful either it it wasn't able to redeem us there's a lot of people that have shed their blood amen for for friends for family for worthy causes for an Amer for America for Nations and and all these things and and yet it's not redeemed man to God it's not helped it's not it's because it's human blood amen sex blood ain't that right so the prophet speaking of Christ said if his blood was Earthly then it was no more than mine and yours right if it was if if his blood was just a human blood then then there's if that blood come from through sexual desire in other words amen then it was no good it it couldn't be any good than you and I ain't that right so but his blood notice his blood was the blood of his father which was the great Creator Jehovah now this is to me powerful and you know it's it's it's hard to imagine that people really don't believe in the Virgin birth there's there's many that don't believe in the Virgin birth or they believe that Mary had something to do with it but Mary had nothing to do with this aren't you glad for that amen Luke 1:35 the angel said to Mary the Holy Ghost shall come upon on thee and the power of the highest shall overshadow thee therefore also that Holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called The Son of God so God created a blood cell within the womb of Mary and that blood cell from that blood cell came the man Jesus Christ ain't that right so brother Brown said see there could not be a woman connected into it if there was then his body was after his mother Mary you know brother brandham he he had gotten this this this uh uh as he was preaching one service he just kind of got a revelation of it and he said did you know he's this I think coming fresh or something like that but he says Mary was not the mother of Jesus as everybody says and he said then you'll never find it in the Bible that Mary was the mother of Jesus when Mary and John there he was on the cross and and Mary and John is saying there and and and and he he said uh what what do he call it John Behold thy mother or something to that effect see and he would call her woman but never did you f you find in the Bible that that Mary was the actual mother of of Jesus Christ she she was the incubator can you say man God B her womb to to to create himself a body see so uh brother Bram said see if if Mary had something to do with it then she would have had to have had a sexual fair with the spirit overshadowing her that caused her to discharge a sperm but that's wrong can you sayen see so he says in another place the Holy Ghost by immaculate conception Hallelujah there he created both sperm of man and woman that word Immaculate means pure perfectly clean and that's what he was it was the Immaculate Conception can you say Amen so then Jesus was neither Jew nor Gentile he was God so then Hebrews 10 and 10 it says by the which will we are Sanctified we are Sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all aren't you glad for that once for all it's settled no need for priests to keep coming and offering a lamb come on and every priest standeth daily ministering he's now talking of the Old Testament priest every priest standeth daily ministering and offering oftimes the same sacrifices which can never take away sins but this man after he had offered one sacrifice for sins forever sat down on the right hand of God from henceforth expecting till his enemies be made his foot stol for by one offering everybody say by one offering he hath perfected forever them that are Sanctified so it isn't sex blood that redeemed us it's not human blood that that loosed us from sin amen but notice acts 2028 take heed therefore unto yourselves and to all the flock over which the Holy Ghost hath made you overseers to feed the Church of God which he hath purchased with his own blood God's own blood yes sir can you say amen God became Flesh and Blood aren't you glad for that amen so so then you're Redeemed by the blood of God right and the prophet said his blood everybody say his blood is the only thing that will make atonement it's God's only way yes sir hallelujah oh I'm so glad for that yes sir Hebrews 13 and 12 wherefore Jesus also that he might sanctify the people with his own blood suffered without the gate Revelations 1:5 and from Jesus Christ who is the faithful witness and the first begotten of the dead and the prince of the kings of the earth unto him that loved us and washed us from our sins in his own blood loosed us true that's right what a great high priest not only did he become our lamb not only became create his own blood but he became our great high priest making intercessions now you can't get any greater of a high priest than God himself can you say amen amen interceding such is the power of this Blood you know uh Roman or Hebrews 9 And1 Christ being come and high priest of good things to come by a greater and more perfect Tabernacle not made with hands that is the say not of this building neither by the blood of goats and calves but by his own blood he entered in once to the holy Place into once into the holy Place notice having obtained Eternal Redemption for us that's right he entered the the holy place that's right by a greater blood a greater voice a greater Testament presenting something greater before the father yes aren't you glad for that yes sir for if the blood of bulls and of goats and the ashes of an hepher sprinkling the unclean sanctify the purifying of the flesh how much more shall the blood of Christ who through the eternal spirit offered himself without spot to God Purge your conscience from dead Works to serve the Living God for this cause he is the mediator of the New Testament or New Covenant that by means of death for the Redemption of the transgressions that were under were under the first testament they which are called might receive the promise of Eternal inheritance aren't you glad for that I'm so glad that God's provided a blood and has become our great high priest now notice Colossians 1:21 and you that were sometimes alienated and enemies in your mind by Wicked Works yet now hath he reconciled you believe you've been reconciled some of you do anyways you believe you've been reconciled back to God yes by the blood of Christ yes sir not only for our soul but for our body and that's where our faith rests in and and want to get more into it maybe next Wednesday or so but where our faith is resting because it cannot be upon our own ideas it cannot be on our own works but there is somebody there is a great high priest amen that's a far greater witness than you and I could ever be that's right of what really Calvary is you say Amen yes sir so he says see you were alienated enemies in your mind by Wicked Works yet now hath he reconciled in the body of his flesh through death to present you holy unblameable unreprovable thank you in his sight aren't you glad for that to think that we could come into this place tonight lifting up holy hands without wrath or doubting to think that we could go through this life and there's not a blemish upon us hallu there there there's nothing CU remember the prophet says when God looks upon you he don't see you he sees the blood he sees the blood so you stand perfect in the sight of God with the blood I'm so glad for that you love him amen if the musicians will come Ephesians 2:1 wherefore remember that ye being in time past Gentiles In the Flesh who are called uncircumcision by that which is called the circumcision in the flesh made by hands that at that time you were without Christ being aliens from the Commonwealth of Israel and strangers from the covenants of Promise having no hope and without God in the world but now everybody say but now in Christ Jesus ye who sometimes were far off made nigh by the blood of Christ Hallelujah I'm so glad for that there is a fountain filled with blood there there is a fountain filled with blood let's go up a key there there there is a fountain filled with blood drawing from FS [Music] and the FL lose all their guil things oh lose all their guilt these stains lose all the guilty St and S that FL lose all their guil St the dying feet reice to see that fountain in his day and there may I though f as he wash all my sins away oh wash off my
