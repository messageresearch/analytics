[41:20] praise the Lord and
[41:23] she's a woman of many Talent
[41:27] praise the Lord and I trust everyone had
[41:32] a good Christmas uh
[41:34] then you um enjoyed
[41:38] time with your friends your family amen
[41:42] and
[41:43] was able to take some time moment just
[41:47] to ponder on the Lord
[41:49] a man of water Christmas really is about
[41:52] a man
[41:53] and but if you'd like to turn with me
[41:56] the book of Psalms the 23rd chapter
[42:00] praise the Lord
[42:07] Psalms 23
[42:11] and we'll start at the first verse but
[42:13] it says the Lord is my shepherd
[42:16] I shall not want he maketh me to lie
[42:19] down in Green Pastures
[42:22] he leadeth me beside the Still Waters he
[42:25] restoreth my soul
[42:27] he leadeth me in the paths of
[42:30] righteousness
[42:32] for his namesake
[42:35] amen let's just bow our heads the word
[42:38] of prayer father
[42:41] as we come to this portion of the
[42:44] service we realize how sacred
[42:47] it is Lord to
[42:50] to talk about your word
[42:54] Lord and father only you can open it to
[42:59] us
[43:00] and father we'd pray that you'd make our
[43:03] understanding clear
[43:06] that you would just forgive us of all of
[43:07] our sins our failures Lord and
[43:11] father that
[43:12] we would just be able to focus
[43:15] and not not under a a spirit of
[43:18] condemnation but of a spirit of faith
[43:21] and Liberty
[43:23] and Lord may you just have your way
[43:25] among us this evening
[43:28] father write your word upon every heart
[43:30] and hear
[43:32] and may our hearts be open to receive
[43:35] Lord of you and we're asking Lord our
[43:39] greatest desire is that you would just
[43:42] draw Us near to you Lord
[43:45] father and may you be more revealed
[43:48] through us than ever before
[43:52] Lord we just committed into your hands
[43:55] we ask it in Jesus Christ's name
[43:58] amen
[44:00] you can have your seats this evening
[44:04] and I'm
[44:08] there's so much in in what we've been
[44:10] talking about in in
[44:12] the first three verses and
[44:15] and uh you really just can't cover it
[44:17] all
[44:18] into what what it really means to have
[44:21] the Lord as our Shepherd and
[44:24] and
[44:25] what his leadership means to us
[44:29] uh his his leadership is really it's
[44:33] it's just beyond words
[44:35] and to be able to be led by him
[44:40] it's it's a paradox
[44:42] because you you have to understand that
[44:45] we're we were going One Direction and
[44:50] everything about us even being tied to
[44:54] our family history or lineage or all of
[44:58] this it it all pointed to One Direction
[45:01] it it it spoke
[45:04] of of a direction we would go I it's
[45:08] just like I've I thought of and wasn't
[45:10] even planning on saying this but I I was
[45:13] thinking of brother Branham of how that
[45:15] he talks about his mother was all bootle
[45:18] you know she come from family of drunks
[45:21] Bootleggers you know we all died with
[45:24] their boots on he says knives and fights
[45:26] and and all of these things
[45:29] and he's you know and he and he says you
[45:32] know you you plant the Cocker Burr
[45:35] or or a wheat whatever you you plant it
[45:39] and it comes up I mean and and whatever
[45:41] you planted that's what it is
[45:43] and he was talking about his lineage of
[45:45] how that this is just the way it's
[45:47] always been he said but then
[45:50] something he said where I stand today
[45:53] and now I'm paraphrasing he said it's a
[45:56] paradox
[45:57] because I'm not that
[46:00] you know that's a paradox and he says
[46:03] and all of us can say the same thing and
[46:05] we can
[46:06] we were tied to a natural lineage and
[46:09] and of that natural tree
[46:12] had really to be honest it spoke for us
[46:15] it it it it it it already showed where
[46:17] we're headed and it's just like the the
[46:20] boy that was adjourned you know his
[46:23] parents were Christians he was a
[46:25] professed Christian but he wanted to get
[46:27] married but he had that he his mom was a
[46:30] German his dad was something else I
[46:32] can't remember and and he was just uh uh
[46:36] he was just an honorary uh kid and and
[46:40] so his parents had went to Brother
[46:41] branham's and but he's he saved he's
[46:44] this he's that you know and and and but
[46:47] brother Branham went to her life and
[46:50] said but yeah but you you're you're
[46:52] German and your family you know he's I
[46:54] know a sister your sister and he said
[46:56] she won't even wave she won't even she
[46:58] says but you're different and he says
[47:00] what made that he said the Holy Ghost
[47:01] made then it broke the chain
[47:04] and he says and that boy you better not
[47:07] marry that girl right because he'll make
[47:09] hell for her he said until he gets the
[47:11] Holy Ghost because the the family
[47:14] lineage the the the bloodline or
[47:16] whatever are Earthly it it it already
[47:19] had a direction for us to go our nature
[47:23] but here we we find that David is saying
[47:27] but the Lord leads me
[47:28] he he's the one that leads me and and as
[47:32] we've talked about it but this last part
[47:35] he leads me in the paths of
[47:37] righteousness and and I have to tell you
[47:39] it that's a paradox
[47:41] and that's a paradox because and and uh
[47:45] uh and this is what I want to deal with
[47:47] and what we're dealing with in this
[47:50] portion of uh scripture is is Works
[47:54] everybody say works works and uh because
[47:59] Works comes with being a Christian
[48:03] and and and the Christian Life uh
[48:06] involves works and as we see we will see
[48:10] that Jesus believed uh that a Christian
[48:13] was to have works uh Luke 6 43 for a
[48:18] good tree bringeth forth bringeth not
[48:21] forth corrupt tree uh corrupt fruit a
[48:25] good tree bringeth not forth corrupt
[48:28] fruit neither doth a corrupt tree bring
[48:31] forth good fruit and and you know it's
[48:36] already been established in in the Book
[48:38] of Psalms and other other places that
[48:41] man is considered as is likened as a
[48:43] tree
[48:44] and and so Jesus again here is liking
[48:47] man as a tree that that a good man can't
[48:51] bring forth corrupt fruit and and a a a
[48:54] corrupt man can't bring forth good fruit
[48:57] ain't that right and then he then he
[48:59] says for every tree every man every tree
[49:03] is known by his own fruit
[49:05] for of thorns men do not gather figs nor
[49:10] of a Bramble Bush gather they grapes so
[49:14] you don't go to a pecan tree to get
[49:17] oranges I uh we're we're all may not
[49:20] have to be we don't have to be Farmers
[49:21] to know that right so the tree is known
[49:24] by its fruits
[49:26] and a good man out of the good Treasure
[49:29] of his heart bringeth forth that which
[49:33] is good and and where where does that
[49:35] begin out of the good Treasure of his
[49:38] heart and and remember remember before
[49:41] we got your day before David says he
[49:43] leadeth me in the paths of righteousness
[49:45] he he makes it clear to us that his soul
[49:48] was restored
[49:50] so so out of the good Treasure of his
[49:53] heart bringeth forth that which is good
[49:55] and an evil man out of the evil Treasure
[49:58] of his heart bringeth forth that which
[49:59] is evil for of the abundance of the
[50:03] heart out of the for of the abundance of
[50:06] the heart his mouth speakeas
[50:08] and why call ye me Lord Lord and do not
[50:12] and do not the things which I say how
[50:17] whosoever cometh to me and heareth my
[50:20] sayings and conjunction do with them
[50:23] heareth and do us I will show you to
[50:28] whom he is like he is like that man a
[50:32] man that builds uh builds a house and
[50:35] dug deep and laid the foundation on a
[50:38] rock and when the flood Rose the stream
[50:41] beat vehemently upon that house and it
[50:43] could not shake it for it was founded
[50:45] upon a rock ain't that right then then
[50:49] he goes on to say that the man that
[50:52] heareth my words and doeth them not he
[50:56] Likens them to the same to a man that
[50:59] done the same thing built his house but
[51:02] he built this house on a sand not the
[51:04] rock Revelation right he built it upon
[51:07] the sand and then when the storms and
[51:10] the same storms the same winds same
[51:13] trials persecutions whatever had come
[51:16] his way his house fell
[51:18] and Jesus made sure that he emphasizes
[51:22] and great was the fall of it ain't that
[51:26] right great so this tells us that we're
[51:29] all going through battles and we all
[51:30] have our trials we all have our uh ups
[51:33] and downs and all that but the key is he
[51:36] that heareth and doeth
[51:39] he that heareth and do us can you say
[51:42] amen he will stand amen so but Jesus he
[51:47] was into doing he was into Works in in
[51:51] that way uh John 14 19 he that hath my
[51:55] Commandments see uh and keepeth them he
[51:59] it is that loveth me and he that loveth
[52:02] me shall be loved of my father and I
[52:04] will love him and will manifest myself
[52:07] to him ain't that right so in thinking
[52:10] of this we've been speaking of of the
[52:13] paths every individual has a path to
[52:16] walk and and uh he's walking down a path
[52:20] and and that path has a certain
[52:23] direction
[52:24] uh uh to it and and and it's leading you
[52:28] into a certain destination a man the
[52:32] path and and and and and sometimes
[52:35] people you know they wonder you know why
[52:38] why you you know everything was going
[52:40] good and all of a sudden everything just
[52:43] my life has turned upside down and you
[52:45] see people burnt out you see people just
[52:48] not serving the lord anymore and and I I
[52:50] have to say it's a path that led them
[52:53] there it did not happen overnight amen
[52:57] uh it was something something took place
[53:01] and so the Bible speaks of two main
[53:04] paths and every human being walks one of
[53:08] these paths uh uh there and and of
[53:11] course as we said that Jesus Jesus said
[53:15] that one path is the Broadway a man
[53:18] which leads to destruction amen now you
[53:21] you think of that and and now I I I I
[53:25] just happened to and and and you know I
[53:28] believe in Redemption so don't don't
[53:30] think I'm not uh in talking in that way
[53:32] but uh too many people start walking out
[53:35] serving the lord and end up uh in a in a
[53:39] trashy somewhere something wrong with
[53:41] that I can't say I don't I I just I just
[53:45] can't see that amen I understand we we
[53:49] fail and I understand we're discouraged
[53:51] and and I understand these things uh uh
[53:55] but but uh uh the Christian Life is a
[53:59] eternal life
[54:00] it's something that is eternal its
[54:02] fruits are Eternal ain't that right I
[54:06] believe even that experience is eternal
[54:08] we talked about even even David saying
[54:11] he's talking about that man he shall be
[54:14] as a tree planted by the rivers of water
[54:16] and and whatsoever he does shall prosper
[54:19] his leaves shall not wither ain't that
[54:22] right he'll bring forth his fruit and
[54:24] due season and all these things and so
[54:26] I'm not talking about seasons in your
[54:28] life I'm not talking about times that
[54:30] you have your lows your ups and highs
[54:32] and all of that uh but but I I do say
[54:35] you'll keep the faith you you'll
[54:38] maintain the course you you'll keep
[54:40] striving can you say amen amen that's
[54:44] right and I've seen I've seen Elders
[54:48] that I just love dearly that I've seen
[54:51] him go through the fire and I think oh
[54:54] my how this is going to take him out and
[54:56] but they're still serving the lord years
[54:58] later amen and yeah and and I have to
[55:02] say it's a path that they were walking
[55:04] on Amen because Jesus said here the
[55:07] Broadway this this this Broadway leads
[55:10] to destruction
[55:11] ain't that right and the other path is a
[55:14] narrow way so One path is a Broadway
[55:18] uh and it leads to destruction the other
[55:22] path is this narrow way and and remember
[55:25] the little lady that tried brother Brown
[55:27] talked about trying to walk that path on
[55:29] high with high heels you know she's
[55:31] trying to walk it you know it was pretty
[55:33] narrow remember she couldn't last it on
[55:36] that on that way amen she fell off see
[55:39] because it's a narrow way but that
[55:41] narrow way leads to life ain't that
[55:43] right so the the paths of righteousness
[55:47] is a is a narrow way and few there be
[55:50] that find it now this Broadway is a path
[55:54] that fits all religions
[55:56] uh all behaviors all Lifestyles it fits
[56:01] any kind of conduct if it's any kind of
[56:04] character uh you don't you you don't
[56:08] have to be shaped you don't have to be
[56:10] molded you don't have to need the Mason
[56:12] uh uh to shape you as uh as the prophet
[56:17] talked about you know the confessions we
[56:19] got our confessions needing a stone
[56:20] Mason to cut them confessions you know
[56:23] uh uh and and to shape our lives right
[56:26] and and uh but but the Broadway you
[56:29] don't have to have that you just go
[56:31] happy go lucky but as you're happy go
[56:33] lucky you have to remember there's a
[56:35] destination that has taken you to now
[56:39] now the wicked prospers in this in this
[56:41] age and and in in this world and and
[56:44] even the Bible talks about it of how can
[56:47] the wicked Prosper amen but but the time
[56:49] is coming a man that that there's
[56:52] destruction at the end of the road ain't
[56:55] that rhyme a man's so so this broad way
[56:58] uh uh if it's all kinds of things it'll
[57:02] fit transgenders on there it'll fit it
[57:04] it'll it'll fit make Believers it'll fit
[57:07] uh uh professors it'll prevent you know
[57:11] it it'll fit people that uh uh
[57:14] homosexuals it'll be you know it'll fit
[57:17] Deacon's married two or three times
[57:19] pastors married you know two five times
[57:21] and uh it'll fit all of these things it
[57:24] just does it it'll fit any kind of false
[57:27] prophet you want it it It just fits it
[57:30] it fits all of that down this broad way
[57:33] ain't that right it's pretty wide you
[57:36] know and and so it has plenty of room
[57:38] for everybody on there but but then we
[57:42] find this narrow way you realize this
[57:45] narrow way only has room for one
[57:49] it only has room for one only one kind
[57:53] of an experience can can can fit on this
[57:56] broad way which we know is the
[57:58] Pentecostal experience only one Doctrine
[58:01] One Faith one baptism one Lord see uh
[58:06] can fit on this this broad or this this
[58:09] narrow way only one character that can
[58:12] that can fit on this this narrow way
[58:14] which is the character of Jesus Christ
[58:17] can you say Amen only one church not not
[58:20] many churches there's many churches in
[58:22] the Broadway
[58:23] many denominations many different ideas
[58:27] many different thoughts but there's only
[58:29] one Church there's only one bride and
[58:31] and that bride is not only got the
[58:34] mechanics she has the Dynamics can you
[58:37] say amen that's right to the mechanics
[58:39] that's right see so this Narrow Path
[58:42] only has room for one and this is why I
[58:46] believe that it's in Jude that he would
[58:48] tell the church contain him for the
[58:50] faith where it was once delivered
[58:52] because any other ain't going to work
[58:54] ain't that right they were already
[58:56] falling away from that one Doctrine from
[58:58] the one Faith from the one uh belief and
[59:01] and one Lord they were already fallen
[59:04] away uh uh in into another way and and
[59:07] Judas tell them you you can't walk that
[59:09] narrow away unless you come back to the
[59:12] faith a man that was once delivered
[59:15] ain't that right and and so we we find
[59:18] again about this narrow path you
[59:21] remember the the vision that brother
[59:22] Branham had of of of of the bride and
[59:27] and he said he was taken by someone and
[59:29] he was set up in a in in a on a high
[59:32] place so he could uh stand and see and
[59:35] and and and and he's uh brother Brahm
[59:38] said I heard the sweetest music I ever
[59:40] heard and he saw women of different
[59:43] nationalities at the age of 18 to 20
[59:46] years old ain't that right they all all
[59:50] had long hair
[59:51] they they and was fixed in different
[59:53] dresses tight dresses and they were
[59:57] marching just as perfectly in Step can
[1:00:01] you say man all of them marching had the
[1:00:04] same step one two three you know as
[1:00:08] they're marching everything and he said
[1:00:10] they were marching perfectly in step
[1:00:12] with that music as it could be but then
[1:00:16] the next thing he sees is he sees the
[1:00:18] churches of the world he would call it
[1:00:20] in one place and he says I heard rock
[1:00:23] and roll band coming and when I looked
[1:00:25] over to my right side and coming up this
[1:00:28] way coming back here come the churches
[1:00:30] of the world each one carrying their own
[1:00:34] Banner ain't that right see from where
[1:00:37] they were from some of the dirtiest
[1:00:39] looking things I ever seen in my life
[1:00:42] and when the American Church come up it
[1:00:45] was the off list I'd ever saw and and
[1:00:48] the the heavenly father is my judge they
[1:00:51] had on the these tattletail gray skirts
[1:00:54] like one of these bar room girls with no
[1:00:57] back on it up here and holding up like a
[1:01:01] gray looking piece of paper and brother
[1:01:04] Brown says gray is a deceiving color
[1:01:06] ain't that right so with these women now
[1:01:09] these churches were deceiving a man and
[1:01:13] he says and look like hula dancing paint
[1:01:16] short bobbed hair smoking cigarettes
[1:01:19] twisting as they walked to rock and roll
[1:01:21] and I said is that the Church of the
[1:01:23] United States of all said yes it is and
[1:01:26] when they passed by they had to hold you
[1:01:28] know the paper like this and put the
[1:01:30] paper behind them when they passed by
[1:01:32] and and and so if you notice they did
[1:01:35] not and none of them there walked like
[1:01:38] the first first church that he saw the
[1:01:41] the first uh uh part but then and
[1:01:44] brother Branham tells us of the reaction
[1:01:46] that he had after seeing this these
[1:01:49] worldly churches the Church of Amer
[1:01:51] American he said when I saw that I and
[1:01:54] knowing what was going on my heart
[1:01:56] locked a broke in me what have I done
[1:01:59] how have I missed it I've stayed right
[1:02:02] with that word Lord how could I have
[1:02:05] done it so he thought this was the
[1:02:08] result of his ministry he thought this
[1:02:11] was the product of his ministry and and
[1:02:14] and and so you could understand how how
[1:02:17] tore up he would be knowing that he was
[1:02:20] the one to to to shape the church he was
[1:02:24] the one to to bring the church amen back
[1:02:27] and and he thought well and this is all
[1:02:30] I've done you know and and so uh he says
[1:02:34] you know I thought well why how why
[1:02:36] would you give me a vision not long ago
[1:02:38] and see me in there uh talking beyond
[1:02:41] the curtain of time and and I said well
[1:02:44] will they have will they have to be
[1:02:46] judged and he said polls group uh two
[1:02:49] and I said I preached the same word he
[1:02:51] did did Christian businessmen carried
[1:02:53] the article of it and I said why why
[1:02:55] would this be like this and I've seen
[1:02:57] that bunch of prostitutes going by like
[1:02:59] that all dressed up like that and called
[1:03:01] The Church of Miss American I just
[1:03:04] fainted and and and so he said but then
[1:03:07] I heard that real sweet music again
[1:03:11] and here come that little same bride
[1:03:15] coming by again and he said this the
[1:03:19] angel said this is what comes out though
[1:03:22] this is what comes out of that dirty
[1:03:25] filthy Bunch this is what comes out of
[1:03:28] that prostitutes can you say man see and
[1:03:32] and so and when she walked by she's
[1:03:34] exactly like the like the one was in the
[1:03:38] first place walking to the step of the
[1:03:40] music of God's word watching on or
[1:03:44] marching on by and when I saw it I stood
[1:03:47] there with both hands up crying like
[1:03:50] that and I come to and I was standing on
[1:03:52] my porch looking out across the field
[1:03:55] and what he asked what she's to be the
[1:03:59] same bride the same kind built out of
[1:04:02] the same kind of material that she was
[1:04:05] in the first place now he takes us to
[1:04:08] Malachi 4 and says see if we're not
[1:04:11] supposed to have an message in the last
[1:04:13] days that will turn the hearts of the
[1:04:15] children back to the fathers back to the
[1:04:18] original Pentecostal message word by
[1:04:20] word Brothers we are here can you say
[1:04:25] man so so I'm I'm so glad a man that
[1:04:29] that that that that the uh there would
[1:04:32] be uh uh someone that could lead us amen
[1:04:36] and show us the way the paths of
[1:04:40] righteousness can you say man so if you
[1:04:42] notice brother branham's Ministry had no
[1:04:45] effect on the churches of the world it
[1:04:48] does not have an effect and and and now
[1:04:51] I I believe that it's bringing judgment
[1:04:54] up upon the people I I believe that it's
[1:04:56] bringing amen judgment upon America the
[1:05:00] message has done that do you believe
[1:05:01] that that but she had to reject it she
[1:05:04] had to turn from that amen so as it was
[1:05:08] with Moses's message amen you realize
[1:05:11] that Moses was to put the children of
[1:05:14] Israel on the path home
[1:05:17] they he's message put them on the path
[1:05:22] to home can you say man brother Graham
[1:05:25] called it the path of Duty ain't that
[1:05:27] right amen and so the message affected
[1:05:30] the people to where they would leave
[1:05:33] Egypt they would leave the garbage they
[1:05:35] would leave slavery they would walk into
[1:05:39] freedom to their Homeland by the message
[1:05:42] of a prophet amen but yet that message
[1:05:45] amen become a judgment to Egypt ain't
[1:05:49] that right and so as we know it is today
[1:05:52] amen but see so we we find that that uh
[1:05:57] the brother branham's Ministry did have
[1:06:00] an effect and still is having effect
[1:06:03] upon this last day bride and and and and
[1:06:07] and and and you will be exactly like the
[1:06:11] one at the first can you say Amen you
[1:06:13] will be like the one because the prophet
[1:06:16] saw you march into the same beat of
[1:06:19] God's word a man not out of state not
[1:06:22] not just twisting him and holding your
[1:06:25] own Banner but you were marching to the
[1:06:28] steps of the word of God ain't that
[1:06:31] right now to me that's a paradox a man
[1:06:34] because uh uh there there's you know uh
[1:06:38] as we talked Sunday there's no beauty
[1:06:40] that we should desire him there's he
[1:06:43] there there's nothing that would attract
[1:06:45] but some something attracted us and it
[1:06:48] wasn't just the seventh grade educated
[1:06:50] uh uh man up there it was Jesus Christ
[1:06:55] showing himself a man through uh the
[1:06:59] ministry ain't that right so the first
[1:07:02] church in this last church are walking
[1:07:03] the same path every believer walks the
[1:07:07] same path the paths of righteousness now
[1:07:10] notice brother Branham in his prayer
[1:07:13] said let the people come from different
[1:07:15] parts and look in him here and see the
[1:07:19] way their conduct is and how they shut
[1:07:22] back from the world or from the things
[1:07:25] of the world back into the real true
[1:07:28] genuine Pentecostal path of real genuine
[1:07:33] Pentecostal experiences walking with you
[1:07:37] blameless help me wants that tonight
[1:07:40] amen that's what we desire that's what
[1:07:42] we pray for is that it the peoples
[1:07:45] around the world the peoples in this
[1:07:47] community a man can look best of all of
[1:07:51] the of of of of uh uh uh when they look
[1:07:55] in here when they can look at us and and
[1:07:58] observe us they they can see a man a a
[1:08:02] people that uh by our conduct that we
[1:08:06] are shocking as brother Brown would call
[1:08:09] that or or uh abstaining as Paul would
[1:08:12] say it in in King James abstaining from
[1:08:15] the things of the world ain't that right
[1:08:17] and that they could see that we are
[1:08:20] walking a true genuine Pentecostal path
[1:08:24] a man with true genuine Pentecostal
[1:08:28] experiences walking with the Lord
[1:08:31] blameless can you say man and so they
[1:08:34] all walk and and this is if you're part
[1:08:36] of this bride in this last day you're
[1:08:39] walking in the steps a man of of the
[1:08:43] word of God you're walking uh uh in the
[1:08:47] step of God's word showing showing there
[1:08:51] is no alternative Amen to this path
[1:08:54] there there isn't amen you you walk as
[1:08:57] the prophet said they were walking in
[1:09:00] the steps a man of God's word in the
[1:09:03] path of God's word and there and there
[1:09:05] was no alternative when it comes to
[1:09:08] walking the paths of righteousness can
[1:09:10] you say man and every believer must walk
[1:09:13] a man the same step
[1:09:15] do you believe that every believer a man
[1:09:18] must walk the same step now you know
[1:09:21] brother Brandon said that he saw two one
[1:09:23] or two of the women getting out of Step
[1:09:26] ain't that right amen and he a man
[1:09:29] screamed out get back in line ain't that
[1:09:33] right aren't you glad you got a message
[1:09:35] that can warn us to get back in line
[1:09:37] amen that's exactly right I thank God
[1:09:41] for the message of the hour yes sir I
[1:09:44] I'm glad that we can play them tapes I'm
[1:09:46] glad amen that we've got ministers here
[1:09:49] in this church a man that'll listen to
[1:09:52] them messages and preach the message
[1:09:54] Amen to us can you say amen amen that we
[1:09:57] can believe it that's right and if you
[1:09:59] believe this message you believe in a
[1:10:00] five-fold Ministry
[1:10:02] yes sir that's right see so so we we I I
[1:10:07] think this tells us that that this
[1:10:10] message is the only thing that can keep
[1:10:12] this bride in line
[1:10:14] that's right it's the only thing that
[1:10:17] can keep us in step with God's word and
[1:10:20] and and if a man woman boy girl is not
[1:10:23] walking in the step of God's word she's
[1:10:25] out of line ain't that right so we we
[1:10:29] find notice that one path is going to
[1:10:32] lead you away from God a man whereas the
[1:10:35] other path is going to lead you to God
[1:10:38] Amen closer to him one path is the path
[1:10:42] of the just the other path is the path
[1:10:45] of the wicked One path is the path of
[1:10:48] life in which the children of light
[1:10:51] walks amen and the other is the path of
[1:10:54] darkness in which the children of
[1:10:57] Disobedience walk can you say amen
[1:10:59] that's that's right see so so we find
[1:11:03] that those who walk the paths of
[1:11:05] righteousness amen uh which is the path
[1:11:09] of Life Light Amen brother Braham calls
[1:11:13] him the paths of light and life a man
[1:11:16] but they can discern and know the
[1:11:18] difference between good and evil between
[1:11:21] right and wrong between just and unjust
[1:11:24] can you say man we're not walking in
[1:11:26] this world blindly we're not walking in
[1:11:28] this world groping as though that's the
[1:11:31] Way of the Wicked they stumble and not
[1:11:34] know what they stumble at but we've got
[1:11:36] light can you say man we've got light
[1:11:39] and and that's why we can boldly amen
[1:11:42] declare we can boldly walk in this life
[1:11:45] amen with confidence because we know who
[1:11:48] we are yes it is the darkest age but
[1:11:51] we've got life yes it is we uh the most
[1:11:54] deceiver as deceiving age that we've got
[1:11:57] the spirit of Truth lighting our path
[1:11:58] can you say Amen yes sir so we we find
[1:12:03] that that God says uh uh uh to to the
[1:12:07] path uh the the wicked uh because
[1:12:10] there's no there's no uh light in that
[1:12:13] path it's a path the darkness and they
[1:12:15] know not what they stumble at and so God
[1:12:18] tells them in this age you know uh says
[1:12:21] to them Thou Art wretched blind
[1:12:23] miserable and naked and knoweth that not
[1:12:26] ain't that right now I want to tell you
[1:12:28] that these paths these two paths have
[1:12:31] nothing in common with one another amen
[1:12:34] that's right two different influences
[1:12:36] two different atmospheres two different
[1:12:39] results ain't that right and God has
[1:12:43] always called for a separation amen
[1:12:47] always brother Brown said separate from
[1:12:49] your Associates separate from your
[1:12:52] habits separate from everything and come
[1:12:55] out and stand alone for God stand alone
[1:12:59] and if you'll ever notice as as I had
[1:13:02] not brought it in at uh uh is that David
[1:13:05] amen the prophet said David as a
[1:13:08] Shepherd a man would lead his sheep he
[1:13:11] was not he didn't lead them in the
[1:13:13] cities where the the people were he led
[1:13:16] them alone amen he was there alone just
[1:13:20] him and his sheep out there away from
[1:13:22] all influences out there away from
[1:13:25] everything amen no other voice but the
[1:13:28] shepherd's voice can you say amen and
[1:13:30] the Sheep you know and and David's
[1:13:33] singing to them amen and it was alone
[1:13:36] well I believe our Shepherd leads us to
[1:13:39] a place that is just us and God Alone
[1:13:42] can you say amen amen he doesn't lead us
[1:13:45] to where we're we're hearing all these
[1:13:46] other voices around do you believe that
[1:13:48] you could go on the job site and not
[1:13:50] hear the voices of the world I just
[1:13:53] believe that you could you could walk
[1:13:54] amen I know we're in this world and and
[1:13:58] and we've got to rub shoulders at the
[1:14:00] store or whatever but I just believe
[1:14:03] that you could come under the influence
[1:14:05] of the Holy Ghost to where the negative
[1:14:07] voices won't have any influence over
[1:14:10] your life again amen that the layout is
[1:14:13] his spirits amen have no influence on
[1:14:16] your soul your life again amen we're all
[1:14:19] these nudity and these filthy dressed
[1:14:21] women amen will have no influence over
[1:14:24] your eyes again amen because you're
[1:14:26] walking in a world alone with God Amen
[1:14:30] do you believe you can do that well I
[1:14:33] just believe that because that's the
[1:14:34] Shepherd that is leading us
[1:14:37] amen amen amen amen so we find a man
[1:14:41] that you must you must separate amen if
[1:14:45] you're going to walk the paths of
[1:14:46] righteousness you've got to separate
[1:14:48] amen uh Abraham had to separate himself
[1:14:51] Moses had to separate amen himself Ruth
[1:14:56] had to separate herself Israel as a
[1:14:59] nation had to separate itself from other
[1:15:02] nations and and uh Joshua and Caleb as
[1:15:06] the elective God had to separate amen
[1:15:09] their testimony from the other
[1:15:11] testimonies they had to separate their
[1:15:13] their their convictions from the other
[1:15:16] convictions they had to separate their
[1:15:19] faith from the unbelief they had to
[1:15:21] separate oh yes sir it was hard for them
[1:15:24] amen because there was ten spies amen
[1:15:27] and and and and and or 12 Spies ten was
[1:15:31] given a negative report amen and and you
[1:15:33] you know good and well as it is today
[1:15:35] amen they they were probably being
[1:15:38] blamed for kissing up to Moses and and
[1:15:40] and you know kind of being the teacher's
[1:15:42] pet and and all that because because
[1:15:43] Joshua and Caleb just would not listen
[1:15:45] to anybody all down to the through
[1:15:48] through and well let's see what Moses
[1:15:50] had to say about this first you know and
[1:15:52] maybe they would try to jive with them
[1:15:54] and try to whine and dine them tried to
[1:15:56] get them over to their side so they
[1:15:58] could all come against Moses but thank
[1:16:00] God there was somebody that stood with
[1:16:02] Moses through it all amen and it may
[1:16:04] have been just a few amen but they
[1:16:07] didn't see amen what the critics saw
[1:16:09] they didn't listen to what the critics
[1:16:10] were listening to amen they were seeing
[1:16:13] Moses in a different light and I say I
[1:16:15] see this message in a different life
[1:16:17] brother Andrew I See You In a Different
[1:16:19] Light I see brother Terry In a Different
[1:16:21] Light I see these ministers in a
[1:16:23] different light amen than what the
[1:16:25] critics are what the world and all these
[1:16:27] other guys amen got to say about it this
[1:16:30] message is right
[1:16:32] can you say Amen this message is right
[1:16:34] there is a Rapture there is a amen a
[1:16:38] body change that's on its way the angel
[1:16:40] of the Lord is here with us
[1:16:44] you just got to separate yourself from
[1:16:46] all the trash
[1:16:48] I'm coming
[1:16:49] and you say man I think it would be good
[1:16:52] for people to do it for about Faith
[1:16:53] Tabernacle too
[1:16:55] separate from all the nonsense out there
[1:16:57] amen and see that God is with us and see
[1:17:01] that God if there is something valuable
[1:17:03] in this church
[1:17:05] can you say Amen
[1:17:07] but you see Joshua and Caleb that's the
[1:17:10] elect they had to separate from from the
[1:17:12] other people amen and Kadesh Barney
[1:17:16] approved that they had done just that
[1:17:18] their hearts weren't tainted with the
[1:17:20] unbelief and skepticism as the others
[1:17:23] their confession didn't bring an evil
[1:17:26] report as did the others amen they
[1:17:28] didn't have an evil heart of unbelief as
[1:17:32] did the others can you say amen and even
[1:17:35] God bore record of that for Jesus or
[1:17:38] Paul said they uh well even Jesus said
[1:17:41] that they're all dead can you say amen
[1:17:44] and they're all dead ain't that right
[1:17:46] amen and what that was that brother
[1:17:48] Brown said eternally separated from God
[1:17:51] that Joshua and Caleb God honored them
[1:17:54] amen God honored their faith God honored
[1:17:57] them for separating from the world can
[1:17:59] you say Amen brother Brown said in
[1:18:02] speaking of the rest of Israel he said
[1:18:04] when carnal Minds begin to come among
[1:18:07] them it finally drove them off the main
[1:18:09] path into the desert and they made their
[1:18:12] fatal mistake when they failed to go on
[1:18:14] ain't that right always carnal Minds
[1:18:17] always carnal Minds that are trying to
[1:18:19] get the people off the paths of
[1:18:21] righteousness oh you can still be
[1:18:23] religious y'all yeah we know the way
[1:18:25] that Moses is trying to go oh you don't
[1:18:28] have to go that way you don't have to do
[1:18:29] this you don't have to do that but what
[1:18:31] they done is them carnal Minds got the
[1:18:34] people from looking got him to look away
[1:18:37] from the pillar of fire got him to look
[1:18:40] away from the Supernatural and all they
[1:18:43] could see was Moses a man all they could
[1:18:46] see is the Moses that got faults and all
[1:18:48] they could see is Moses this and old
[1:18:51] fatty daddy Moses and all this and and
[1:18:53] all of that that what they failed to see
[1:18:56] was there was a pillar of fire they
[1:18:59] should have stood with Moses and
[1:19:02] separated from their unbelief
[1:19:05] now Church separation is a is something
[1:19:08] that is required Joshua had to separate
[1:19:11] Israel from Aiken and his family
[1:19:13] ain't that right Aiken's sin had caused
[1:19:17] Israel to fail in battle and we know how
[1:19:21] Joshua made that separation amen he made
[1:19:24] that Separation by putting to death amen
[1:19:27] Aiken and his whole family amen ain't
[1:19:30] that right you see he cut uh uh and
[1:19:33] Joshua knew how to make that separation
[1:19:35] amen there was sin in the camp and he
[1:19:38] wanted to get rid of that sin ain't that
[1:19:40] right amen and sin will go in a man's
[1:19:44] genealogy in his seed after him amen uh
[1:19:48] we find that in the Old Testament a
[1:19:51] man's sin lived on in his seed Adam's
[1:19:55] sin affected his seed ain't that right
[1:19:57] Adam not only lost everything but the
[1:19:59] prophet said Adam's seed lost everything
[1:20:02] as well amen lost absolutely everything
[1:20:06] see now now you could go we could do a
[1:20:08] study on that Ahab and how did the sins
[1:20:10] came
[1:20:11] upon his children and
[1:20:14] all the way down amen now we know we
[1:20:18] know though that there is a way to cut
[1:20:20] that sin off
[1:20:21] aren't you glad for that amen there
[1:20:24] there is a way and that's the blood of
[1:20:26] Jesus Christ amen for first John 1 7 if
[1:20:29] we walk in the light as he is in the
[1:20:32] light key word if everybody say if if we
[1:20:36] walk in the light as he is in the light
[1:20:38] we have Fellowship one with another and
[1:20:41] the blood of Jesus Christ his son
[1:20:44] cleanseth us from some sins all sins
[1:20:48] ain't that right all sins that means my
[1:20:51] sins my daddy sins my mama's sins my my
[1:20:55] great-grandfather's sins you understand
[1:20:57] what I'm saying amen all of that from
[1:20:59] the family tree is cut off and it makes
[1:21:02] a paradox out of us
[1:21:05] well it's true amen I just believe that
[1:21:08] there's power in the blood can you say
[1:21:10] Amen well we we find but but Joshua amen
[1:21:14] he he he had cut that sin out Amen to
[1:21:18] show us that you've got to cut the sin
[1:21:21] out
[1:21:22] separate from the sin can you say Amen
[1:21:25] you got to separate from all unbelief
[1:21:29] do you believe that God is separate it
[1:21:31] if something is causing you to stay
[1:21:33] behind and not fight not win your
[1:21:36] battles find out where it is separate
[1:21:39] from it
[1:21:41] I don't care if it's thoughts of
[1:21:42] unbelief I don't care if it's words of
[1:21:45] unbelief I don't care if it's actions of
[1:21:47] unbelief separate yourself if your
[1:21:50] thoughts are contrary to the word of God
[1:21:53] to separate yourself if your five senses
[1:21:56] are contrary to this word separate
[1:21:59] yourself if your emotions are are
[1:22:02] contrary Amen to What God Says separate
[1:22:06] yourself can you say Amen if you're
[1:22:09] hanging around people who speak or act
[1:22:11] contrary to the word of God separate
[1:22:14] yourself now brother that's important
[1:22:16] that you separate yourself
[1:22:19] and you say man brother Brown says now
[1:22:21] be careful of your Associates when you
[1:22:23] get out there and get amongst the people
[1:22:25] and this one begins to tell you this and
[1:22:27] this one that and then you get yourself
[1:22:29] all mixed up and now you don't know what
[1:22:31] to do see you don't know what you do
[1:22:33] believe can you say man why you didn't
[1:22:36] separate yourself
[1:22:39] that's right
[1:22:40] I've seen good-hearted people that used
[1:22:42] to believe this message was all their
[1:22:44] heart
[1:22:45] then get mixed up with a bunch of uh of
[1:22:48] unbelievers now they don't know what to
[1:22:51] believe
[1:22:52] I'm sure you've talked to him too if
[1:22:54] they don't know what to believe then you
[1:22:56] say Amen some of them have turned
[1:22:58] completely against it they should have
[1:23:00] separated themselves
[1:23:01] then you say Amen you got to separate if
[1:23:04] you're going to walk the paths of
[1:23:05] righteousness
[1:23:06] ain't that right I've seen people that
[1:23:09] were pillars in the church they want
[1:23:10] support of the local church they weren't
[1:23:12] supported amen the pastor the ministry
[1:23:14] and only to to end up listening to a
[1:23:17] bunch of Renegades that do nothing but
[1:23:19] complain about anything they can and
[1:23:22] find fault about anything that they can

[1:23:45] that starts this race it's he that
[1:23:48] endureth to the end the same shall be

[1:24:31] to be around it

[1:25:27] step amen if you make progress let it be
[1:25:29] a progress to God Amen whatever you do
[1:25:32] let it be that you know that God
[1:25:35] approves of it
[1:25:38] can you say Amen turn not to the right
[1:25:41] hand or to the left so this path is the
[1:25:43] middle
[1:25:44] the middle of the road
[1:25:46] turn not from the right or to the left
[1:25:48] and remove thy foot from evil

[1:25:56] Psalms 26 2 examine me this is David
[1:26:00] examine Me O Lord and prove me try my
[1:26:04] Reigns and my heart for thy loving

[1:26:17] with uh dissemblers
[1:26:20] see I have not in other words and I will
[1:26:23] not be part of them
[1:26:24] ain't that right I have hated the
[1:26:27] congregation of evildoers and will not
[1:26:30] sit with the wicked amen see in other
[1:26:33] words David said I'm not going to be
[1:26:35] associated with things that are contrary
[1:26:37] to God Amen if if someone wants to
[1:26:40] disbelieve that ain't me and I don't
[1:26:42] want to associate with it my ears are
[1:26:44] not garbage cans can you say amen amen I
[1:26:48] I'm I don't care what the critic says I
[1:26:51] don't I'd rather stand with a Believer
[1:26:53] any day in and and deal with all the
[1:26:55] faults and the failures and and all the
[1:26:57] struggles that they're going through
[1:26:59] amen then to associate in the in the
[1:27:02] congregation of the wicked can you say
[1:27:04] amen and so here David says I've hated
[1:27:07] the congregation of evildoers and will
[1:27:10] not see it with the wicked remember he's
[1:27:12] the one that's being led in the paths of
[1:27:14] righteousness so his works his actions
[1:27:17] is showing the path that he's walking on
[1:27:19] Amen this is a narrow path I ain't got
[1:27:22] time I ain't got time to to Baby
[1:27:24] everybody else I ain't got time Amen to
[1:27:27] bring everybody over amen if you want to
[1:27:29] come over come under the blood if you
[1:27:32] want to come over make the Lord your
[1:27:34] Shepherd if you want to come over you've
[1:27:36] got to walk the paths of righteousness
[1:27:38] can you say Amen this is not a broad way
[1:27:41] it is a narrow way
[1:27:46] David he didn't hate for he says I've
[1:27:50] hated the congregation of evil doers he
[1:27:52] didn't hate in the way that the world
[1:27:54] hates the believer mean hateful seeking
[1:27:57] to destroy
[1:27:59] but what David is is is is saying
[1:28:02] is he's letting it be known as to what
[1:28:06] side he's on
[1:28:08] no don't don't you don't you just hate
[1:28:10] being around someone that they're being
[1:28:13] nice to you but you know down in your
[1:28:16] heart or or the that they they would
[1:28:19] they would love to to hit you or they
[1:28:22] would love to to whatever you you really
[1:28:24] don't know where they stand with you you
[1:28:27] understand what I'm saying you you don't
[1:28:29] know you know they they love you Pat you
[1:28:32] on the back and then you know give it
[1:28:34] just a little ways and then they turn on
[1:28:36] you and before you know it their their
[1:28:38] fangs are sticking out and their claws
[1:28:40] are sticking out and and and all these
[1:28:42] things but David is making it clear he's
[1:28:44] making it known God I'm not one of these
[1:28:47] people can you say Amen I'm not saying I
[1:28:50] love you through one part of my mouth
[1:28:52] and and the other part I'm saying oh
[1:28:54] it's okay I know I know I know you're
[1:28:56] okay I know that preacher is a little
[1:28:58] bit hard bless his heart and bless your
[1:29:00] heart too you'll be okay you just you
[1:29:02] just go on somewhere else he's a little
[1:29:04] narrow-minded well it's a narrow way can
[1:29:07] you say man it's a path of righteousness
[1:29:11] oh yes sir see so he did not mingle his
[1:29:15] colors to where a man didn't know where
[1:29:18] he stood can you say man I don't know
[1:29:20] about you but I want the Lord to know
[1:29:21] I'm on his side I want the believer to
[1:29:24] know I'm on their side amen I want to
[1:29:27] know I want the world to know that I'm
[1:29:28] on God's side can you say man I'm on the
[1:29:32] side of the redeemed I'm on the side of
[1:29:34] the people that is determined to make it
[1:29:35] to heaven I'm on the side of the people
[1:29:38] that ain't playing games and and
[1:29:40] wondering here and wondering there and
[1:29:42] wondering there and wants to be padded
[1:29:44] and babied and all of these things I
[1:29:46] want to be on the side of those that are
[1:29:49] rugged true blue Christians
[1:29:54] and this is what David is saying he's
[1:29:57] letting it be known as to what side he
[1:29:59] is on
[1:30:01] can you say man he sided with truth
[1:30:04] because he walked in truth he is
[1:30:07] associated with the believer because he
[1:30:08] was a Believer he walked in
[1:30:10] righteousness because he was righteous
[1:30:13] ain't that right he stayed with
[1:30:15] Integrity because he had integrity and
[1:30:19] there was no other alternative for him
[1:30:22] amen he was standing with those that
[1:30:25] were true brother Brown says all in
[1:30:27] water don't mix and many times a many
[1:30:30] good life has been completely wrecked by
[1:30:33] your Associates show me your company
[1:30:35] I'll tell you who you are that's right
[1:30:38] it's an old proverb but it's the truth
[1:30:40] associate with people who believe God
[1:30:42] can you say man associate with people
[1:30:45] that ain't trying to destroy you
[1:30:47] associate with people amen that ain't
[1:30:50] trying to tear down the ministry
[1:30:51] associate people with people that's got
[1:30:53] anointing upon their life associate with
[1:30:56] people that you know that God has proved
[1:30:58] of their lives and they're living right
[1:31:00] and they're they're living true amen
[1:31:02] they're walking on the paths of
[1:31:04] righteousness they ain't living as a
[1:31:05] hypocrite they trying to cut Corners
[1:31:08] amen they're just trying to live for God
[1:31:12] can you say Amen
[1:31:15] as I have already stated in the past
[1:31:24] a man's character conduct Behavior
[1:31:27] and lifestyle tells what pathy's walking
[1:31:31] on
[1:31:34] if you're walking on the path of
[1:31:35] righteousness you ain't got room
[1:31:40] for other things
[1:31:44] if you're walking on the Broadway you
[1:31:46] can carry anything you want
[1:31:48] live any way you want
[1:31:51] act any old way you want
[1:31:54] talk about anything you want
[1:31:57] watch anything you want listen to
[1:31:59] anything you want
[1:32:01] can you say man
[1:32:03] I hope this is okay
[1:32:06] and and we'll get you excited and
[1:32:09] hopefully in a minute
[1:32:12] but brother Branham says any man can
[1:32:14] watch your own life
[1:32:17] and tell what you are
[1:32:20] if you just check up on yourself whether
[1:32:22] you're a really a Christian or not watch
[1:32:25] the things you do
[1:32:27] what you say and your Associates and so
[1:32:30] forth and you'll find out whether you
[1:32:33] really got anything there or not
[1:32:36] can you say Amen
[1:32:38] now Matthew 6 and 19
[1:32:41] Jesus says lay not up for yourselves
[1:32:44] Treasures upon Earth where moth and rust
[1:32:48] doth corrupt and where thieves break
[1:32:51] through and steal
[1:32:53] but lay up for yourselves Treasures in
[1:32:56] Heaven where neither moth nor rust doth
[1:33:00] corrupt and where thieves do not break
[1:33:02] through nor steal
[1:33:05] listen for where your treasure is there
[1:33:08] your heart will be also
[1:33:11] ain't that right so Jesus is telling us
[1:33:14] that there's Treasures both in Earth and
[1:33:16] both in heaven there's Treasures in
[1:33:19] Earth and there's Treasures in Heaven
[1:33:21] and wherever your heart is whatever
[1:33:24] treasure whether your heart is in heaven
[1:33:26] or your heart is on earth and the
[1:33:29] treasures there's where your treasure is
[1:33:30] going to be can you say man now if
[1:33:33] you're if you value the treasures in
[1:33:35] heaven then you'll look at the treasures
[1:33:36] see one man's junk is another man's
[1:33:39] treasure
[1:33:40] can you say man and I think that goes
[1:33:43] the same way a man that is not Heavenly
[1:33:46] minded that's junk to him
[1:33:48] but that's life to us
[1:33:51] it's a pearl of great price to us can
[1:33:54] you say amen he doesn't understand why
[1:33:56] to give up this and and the need to give
[1:33:59] up that and the need to give up this and
[1:34:01] and to live a holy life live a blameless
[1:34:05] life and live a life that is so pleasing
[1:34:08] unto the Lord can you say Amen but see a
[1:34:11] man that's got his heart in Heavenly
[1:34:13] Treasures amen that's where he's after
[1:34:15] that's what he's seeking for that that's
[1:34:18] that's his goal can you say man we'll
[1:34:20] leave anything here behind let me just
[1:34:23] have him
[1:34:25] but now if a man's got his if if his
[1:34:28] treasures are in heaven then then the
[1:34:30] Earthly Treasures are junk
[1:34:32] but if the man's heart is here in the
[1:34:34] treasures of this life then the Heavenly
[1:34:36] things are junk see you can't the the
[1:34:39] two men can't understand one another
[1:34:41] because their heart their passion their
[1:34:43] desire is is after two totally different
[1:34:47] things
[1:34:50] and you say Amen
[1:34:52] now I I just believe in people and I'm
[1:34:56] not talking here I'm just talking
[1:34:57] worldwide but if people can get out of
[1:35:00] their backslidden condition
[1:35:03] ah
[1:35:04] so to discern the difference in the
[1:35:06] treasures
[1:35:08] and to discern what we need to be
[1:35:11] holding on to
[1:35:13] and what we need to be letting go of
[1:35:16] can you say Amen
[1:35:17] because if we're walking the paths of
[1:35:20] righteousness there is a certain
[1:35:22] treasure there there is a certain desire
[1:35:25] there there is a certain thing we are
[1:35:28] after
[1:35:33] listen Colossians 3 1 if ye then be
[1:35:36] risen with Christ seek those things
[1:35:38] which are above how many is risen with
[1:35:40] Christ
[1:35:41] risen with Christ if you're risen with
[1:35:43] Christ then then here's your actions now
[1:35:45] here's the works that follow that
[1:35:48] seek those things that are above
[1:35:51] where Christ sitteth on the right hand
[1:35:52] of God
[1:35:54] we could get into that that's but set
[1:35:57] your affections on things above and not
[1:36:00] on things on the Earth
[1:36:02] for you are dead
[1:36:04] you're dead
[1:36:06] and your life is hid with Christ in God
[1:36:09] when Christ who is our life shall appear
[1:36:12] then you shall appear also with him in
[1:36:14] glory ain't that right so when a man is
[1:36:17] dead
[1:36:19] and and and his life is hid with Christ
[1:36:22] and God then he seeks those things that
[1:36:26] are above
[1:36:27] because that's where his treasure is
[1:36:29] that's where his affection is that's
[1:36:31] where his heart is
[1:36:34] can you say amen and they're Heavenly
[1:36:36] Treasures now notice David says he
[1:36:39] leadeth me and I won't keep you much
[1:36:40] longer but Dave says he leadeth me in
[1:36:43] the paths of righteousness and this is
[1:36:46] not talking about our own righteousness
[1:36:47] so so when we're talking of works and
[1:36:49] we're talking of these things we're not
[1:36:52] talking legalism we're not talking of of
[1:36:54] of these things but I'm I'm just here to
[1:36:57] tell you walking the paths of
[1:36:59] righteousness produces works now let's
[1:37:02] go into that for just a moment before we
[1:37:04] close it's not talking about our own
[1:37:07] righteousness
[1:37:08] um uh Isaiah 64 6 we are all as an
[1:37:12] unclean thing and all everybody say all
[1:37:15] our righteousness our s filthy rags and
[1:37:19] we all do Fade as a leaf and our
[1:37:21] iniquities like the wind have taken us
[1:37:24] away ain't that right see so all of our
[1:37:27] righteousness is is are as filthy rags
[1:37:29] Galatians 2 19. Paul would say I do not
[1:37:33] frustrate the grace of God
[1:37:36] amen I do not frustrate the grace of God
[1:37:39] for if righteousness come by the law
[1:37:41] which is the works of the flesh right
[1:37:43] that's what the works of the law was is
[1:37:46] men doing it without the help of God
[1:37:48] without the aid of God without the grace
[1:37:50] of God right
[1:37:53] that's right see amen he says then
[1:37:55] Christ is dead if righteousness if our
[1:37:58] righteousness the righteousness we gain
[1:38:00] come from by the law and and again the
[1:38:05] works of the flesh then Christ died in
[1:38:08] vain
[1:38:09] ain't that right correct the law
[1:38:12] produces righteousness leaves Christ out
[1:38:15] of the picture
[1:38:18] but Paul is saying there are works and
[1:38:21] yet it does not do away with the grace
[1:38:23] of God
[1:38:25] ain't that right we're not walking in
[1:38:27] our own righteousness and the law
[1:38:29] produced or or promoted
[1:38:31] self-righteousness
[1:38:32] ain't that right self works but yet we
[1:38:36] so it's not our we don't walk in our own
[1:38:38] righteousness but yet he leads us in the
[1:38:41] paths of righteousness
[1:38:43] but these are his Paths of righteousness
[1:38:51] look look at this second Timothy 1 9 he
[1:38:53] hath saved us and called us with an holy
[1:38:55] calling not according to our own words
[1:38:58] but according to his own purpose and
[1:39:00] Grace
[1:39:00] which was given us in Christ Jesus
[1:39:03] before the world began ain't that right
[1:39:05] so now the message of the hour gives us
[1:39:08] a greater understanding of what uh uh
[1:39:11] righteousness means
[1:39:13] Matthew 3 and 13.
[1:39:16] it says then Jesus then then cometh
[1:39:19] Jesus From Galilee to Jordan unto John
[1:39:22] to be baptized of him but John forbade
[1:39:25] him saying I have need to be baptized to
[1:39:27] thee and cometh thou to me
[1:39:30] and John answering and said unto him
[1:39:32] suffer to be so now
[1:39:35] for thus it becometh everybody say it
[1:39:37] become us
[1:39:40] to fulfill all righteousness
[1:39:44] ain't that right then he suffered him
[1:39:50] now John being a prophet
[1:39:53] he knew who Jesus was
[1:39:56] it was revealed to him that he was the
[1:39:58] Lamb of God
[1:40:00] he knew that his Revelation was correct
[1:40:03] ain't that right
[1:40:05] and he did the prophet said he did need
[1:40:08] to be baptized to Jesus
[1:40:12] they needed it
[1:40:14] but notice Jesus did not consent to that
[1:40:18] but Jesus being the word
[1:40:22] told John
[1:40:23] and said it was becoming
[1:40:26] to both of them to fulfill all
[1:40:29] righteousness
[1:40:31] keep that in mind fulfill our
[1:40:33] righteousness brother Brown said see if
[1:40:36] John and Jesus were the lights of that
[1:40:38] day then they had to fulfill all
[1:40:42] righteousness
[1:40:44] can you say Amen
[1:40:45] so it's been a question you know brother
[1:40:48] Brown talks about it even he wondered
[1:40:49] how is it that Jesus needed to be
[1:40:52] baptized of John
[1:40:53] for for baptism is after your confession
[1:40:57] and Jesus after your confession of sins
[1:41:00] and Jesus had no sins to confess so why
[1:41:03] is it that that that that he needed to
[1:41:07] be baptized of John uh uh when he was
[1:41:11] without sin and so Jesus just simply
[1:41:15] tells us why it becometh us to fulfill
[1:41:18] all righteousness and he and seeing this
[1:41:22] without saying it he was referring to a
[1:41:25] scripture in in in the Old Testament can
[1:41:29] you say Amen so here we find that the
[1:41:33] prophet now takes that scripture it
[1:41:36] becamethas to fulfill our righteousness
[1:41:38] and takes us to the scripture that Jesus
[1:41:42] was referring to
[1:41:44] so Exodus 29 4 and Aaron and his sons uh
[1:41:49] Thou shalt bring unto the door of the
[1:41:52] Tabernacle of the congregation and shalt
[1:41:54] wash them with water
[1:41:57] and thou shalt take the garments and put
[1:41:59] air upon Aaron the colt and the robe of
[1:42:03] the IP iPod and the iPod and the
[1:42:06] breastplate and gird him with the
[1:42:08] Curious girdle of the ephod and thou
[1:42:10] shall put the the miter upon his head
[1:42:13] and put the holy crown upon the miter
[1:42:15] then then Thou shalt take the anointing
[1:42:19] oil and pour it upon his head and anoint
[1:42:22] him can you say Amen but what was the
[1:42:25] first thing he had to be washed before
[1:42:27] he was anointed
[1:42:29] he had to be washed now the
[1:42:32] understanding that Jesus had of this
[1:42:34] scripture
[1:42:35] was it pertains to me
[1:42:39] ain't that right so so even a prophet
[1:42:43] John feeling so humble and feeling so
[1:42:47] needful of to be baptized by Jesus
[1:42:50] recognizing who he was but Jesus stayed
[1:42:53] with the scriptures
[1:42:54] Jesus knew that he had to fulfill all
[1:42:58] righteousness and John was part of the
[1:43:01] scripture
[1:43:03] yeah
[1:43:05] for Jesus had to be baptized of John
[1:43:08] can you say Amen so we find it becometh
[1:43:12] us to fulfill now all righteousness now
[1:43:15] we know that he was the lamb
[1:43:17] he was Meek and gentle
[1:43:20] he was led
[1:43:21] he said my meat is to do the will of my
[1:43:24] father or the will of him that sent me
[1:43:27] and to finish his work
[1:43:29] ain't that right he was flexible to the
[1:43:32] word that he was predestinated to
[1:43:34] fulfill
[1:43:36] he was compliant to the leading of the
[1:43:38] spirit
[1:43:39] hello
[1:43:41] remember he's saying it becometh us to
[1:43:43] fulfill all righteousness he's letting
[1:43:46] us know he's walking a path
[1:43:49] ain't that right he's not dumb to the
[1:43:52] word he's not ignorant to the word he
[1:43:54] knows he's predestinated
[1:43:59] can you say amen he was the word so he
[1:44:02] knew the word so he could be led to the
[1:44:05] Wilderness to be tempted
[1:44:06] flexible
[1:44:08] he could be led to the pool of Bethesda
[1:44:10] for one man
[1:44:12] flexible
[1:44:14] he can be led out of his way for one
[1:44:16] predestinated Soul who was a prostitute
[1:44:19] ain't that right he can be led to the
[1:44:22] Garden of Gethsemane he can be led to
[1:44:25] pilate's Hall he could be led like a
[1:44:27] sheep to the slaughter
[1:44:29] and yet it was all to fulfill all
[1:44:33] righteousness
[1:44:35] then you say man he was led in the paths
[1:44:39] of righteousness
[1:44:43] hope that's all right I want you to I
[1:44:45] want you to know now that being led by
[1:44:47] the spirit has its high and lows
[1:44:52] you're not always going to feel
[1:44:53] Goosebumps
[1:44:55] you're not always and again this is the
[1:44:57] narrow way
[1:45:00] you ain't got all kinds of purpose Jesus
[1:45:02] did not have all kinds of purposes
[1:45:05] he wasn't a jack of all trades
[1:45:08] he was there for one purpose and that
[1:45:10] was to fill fulfill the word of the
[1:45:12] father
[1:45:13] the will of the father can you say Amen
[1:45:16] and he has his highs and he had his loge
[1:45:19] have you ever just had your highs and
[1:45:21] your lows when you're high you're not
[1:45:23] questioning God where you are you know
[1:45:25] where you are but when you're down in
[1:45:27] the low you just wondered did I miss the
[1:45:29] boat
[1:45:30] where you at
[1:45:33] don't feel anything
[1:45:35] been there
[1:45:37] yeah well that's your half
[1:45:41] but one thing about Jesus is he did not
[1:45:45] need to feel anything
[1:45:47] he knew what the word was concerning him
[1:45:51] that's why you've got to have all your
[1:45:53] ways established and Ponder the feet of
[1:45:55] your paths
[1:45:58] amen
[1:46:00] so you have people do that understands
[1:46:03] and you have people that don't
[1:46:04] understand
[1:46:05] yet all the word the prophet says that
[1:46:08] God has spoken must be fulfilled
[1:46:11] ain't that right he says God cannot say
[1:46:14] anything without having it fulfilled
[1:46:16] when he has spoken it it is a finished
[1:46:18] work
[1:46:19] you believe that
[1:46:21] yes sir it's already finished when God
[1:46:24] speaks it God never speaks it until he's
[1:46:27] ready for it to be and when he speaks
[1:46:29] it's just as well as already happened
[1:46:31] ain't that right so as we close now
[1:46:35] Jesus was the word made flesh ain't that
[1:46:39] right he wasn't an impersonator he was
[1:46:41] the word made flesh brother Brown said
[1:46:44] his sinless nature expressed God's word
[1:46:47] see he was the word so God expressed
[1:46:51] himself by that sinless nature
[1:46:55] he another place he in the word was the
[1:46:58] same so the word could just flow through
[1:47:01] him there was no doubt at all
[1:47:05] oh my God help us right
[1:47:10] no doubt at all
[1:47:12] he was completely separated from all
[1:47:16] unbelief
[1:47:18] he lived in a world unto himself
[1:47:21] ain't that right
[1:47:22] amen now notice what the prophet said
[1:47:24] God is trying to get somebody through
[1:47:27] the sanctifying power of Christ to yield
[1:47:31] to that word
[1:47:33] that he and the word can be won again
[1:47:36] then he can use his word through that
[1:47:39] person
[1:47:42] and you say Amen your dreams have got to
[1:47:44] go your ideas have got to go your
[1:47:47] Ambitions have got to go and they got to
[1:47:50] focus on one thing and that is the word
[1:47:52] of God
[1:47:53] you understand that you were
[1:47:55] predestinated brother Tim for this
[1:47:57] message of the hour you were
[1:47:58] predestinated to fulfill the word for
[1:48:01] this hour
[1:48:03] ain't that right now notice if his
[1:48:05] sinless nature God expressed himself
[1:48:08] through that sinless nature and it shows
[1:48:11] that our nature is evil and is no matter
[1:48:15] how much we try to patch it up see it's
[1:48:17] still evil or how much we try to in
[1:48:19] document made it with other things it's
[1:48:22] got to become sinless everybody say it's
[1:48:24] got to become sinless
[1:48:26] who your nature
[1:48:29] those that are walking the paths of
[1:48:31] righteousness
[1:48:32] it's got to become sinless like his was
[1:48:36] and then hereby say and then God's word
[1:48:40] can flow through it can you say Amen but
[1:48:43] it wasn't it's not meaning perfection in
[1:48:45] yourself
[1:48:46] it's not meaning that you've got to be
[1:48:48] perfect in yourself you go because
[1:48:50] because you can't do that ain't that
[1:48:52] right amen even though we practice the
[1:48:55] way of Holiness I believe in Holiness
[1:48:57] standards do you believe in all in his
[1:48:59] standards we still believe in Holiness
[1:49:01] ain't that right but that is not making
[1:49:04] us perfect
[1:49:06] that only reflects a Perfection has been
[1:49:09] done
[1:49:10] it reflects a perfect life that is in US
[1:49:16] ain't that right brother Brown said it
[1:49:19] only reflects what we're possessing
[1:49:22] so he says he is our example he is our
[1:49:25] sin Bearer
[1:49:27] and if then if we profess that he is our
[1:49:30] Peacemaker he is our propitiation
[1:49:33] then if we profess that then that is
[1:49:36] supposed to reflect him back in US
[1:49:40] right
[1:49:41] so so we're not here trying to be
[1:49:44] sinless
[1:49:46] in that it's our own righteousness but
[1:49:49] we're looking to him
[1:49:51] as our peace
[1:49:53] we're looking to him as one that has
[1:49:56] taken our sins
[1:49:58] we are looking unto him as the one that
[1:50:01] is the justifier
[1:50:03] can you say Amen we are we we are
[1:50:07] looking to him as the cause of our
[1:50:10] righteousness
[1:50:12] and when we're confessing that and we're
[1:50:15] looking at that then he is reflected
[1:50:17] back in US
[1:50:20] can you say man
[1:50:22] supposed to reflect him back in us we
[1:50:25] are written epistle a looking glass or a
[1:50:29] mirror
[1:50:30] that people can see Christ in US
[1:50:33] now if they don't then we're looking at
[1:50:35] something else and we're not looking to
[1:50:36] him looking to him all the ends of the
[1:50:39] world and live can you say Amen so what
[1:50:42] did Jesus tell us to do seek ye first
[1:50:44] the kingdom of God and his everybody say
[1:50:48] he is righteousness
[1:50:50] ain't that right that's what you're to
[1:50:53] do that's what I'm supposed to do is
[1:50:54] seek the kingdom of God first and his
[1:50:57] righteousness brother Brown said his
[1:50:59] sinless nature expressed the word of God
[1:51:02] so much that he and the Word was one he
[1:51:06] said so I and my father are one I always
[1:51:09] do that which pleases see uh uh I and my
[1:51:13] father are just one he was so perfect in
[1:51:16] the image of God until he and God was
[1:51:19] the express same thing he was the flesh
[1:51:22] the son that expressed the deity of God
[1:51:25] so that made him deity in a man in order
[1:51:30] to redeem a man
[1:51:32] can you say Amen notice now he and the
[1:51:36] word became one that the word could
[1:51:39] express and could show to the world that
[1:51:43] example of what man should be
[1:51:48] aren't you glad for that
[1:51:50] he being that example now again you
[1:51:53] can't be that in yourself brother Brian
[1:51:55] said you can't educate yourself into it
[1:51:59] you can't School yourself into it you
[1:52:01] you you you can't join it baptize it he
[1:52:04] said the only thing you can do is kill
[1:52:05] it
[1:52:06] kill your nature
[1:52:07] kill it right
[1:52:09] that's right and he says and let it be
[1:52:11] born again and a new nature come in
[1:52:13] that's the only thing kill that nature
[1:52:15] of yourself that you might become and
[1:52:17] then the word everybody say then the
[1:52:19] word becomes a living thing
[1:52:23] and the word
[1:52:25] becomes a living thing
[1:52:27] right what Treasures
[1:52:30] it just expresses itself through you
[1:52:32] then you're looking in the looking glass
[1:52:34] or the mirror when people sees you as a
[1:52:37] mirror oh do you love him any wonderful
[1:52:41] we could go on but if the musicians will
[1:52:43] come he leads me in the paths of
[1:52:46] righteousness
[1:52:47] and brother Brown said what is the
[1:52:49] righteousness his word
[1:52:54] his word
[1:52:57] it becometh us to fulfill all
[1:52:59] righteousness or all his word
[1:53:02] he leads me in the paths of his word
[1:53:06] can you say Amen
[1:53:08] and if you notice first of all David
[1:53:10] would tell us that his soul was restored
[1:53:12] he restoreth my soul
[1:53:15] amen
[1:53:16] he couldn't write about the paths of
[1:53:18] righteousness
[1:53:22] if the soul
[1:53:24] the soul has to be restored
[1:53:27] as we've as we've seen
[1:53:30] your flesh can be anointed
[1:53:33] if that doesn't mean you're saved
[1:53:35] your spirit can be anointed but that
[1:53:37] doesn't mean you're saved you can shout
[1:53:39] dance speak in tongues prophesy
[1:53:43] dream dreams roll on the floor
[1:53:49] ain't that right
[1:53:52] but when that Soul has become restored
[1:53:57] where God is able to establish his
[1:54:00] throne
[1:54:01] in your heart
[1:54:03] that's the throne room
[1:54:05] then brother Brown said it's the soul
[1:54:07] that controls the spirit and the spirit
[1:54:09] controls the flesh
[1:54:10] [Music]
[1:54:12] that whoever's in that soul
[1:54:16] and if Christ is in that soul
[1:54:19] it brings everything in subjection to
[1:54:21] the word of God
[1:54:24] remember I'm talking about the man that
[1:54:26] was prophesying speaking in tongues and
[1:54:28] it was true
[1:54:31] shook his hand found out he was living
[1:54:33] with a totally different woman
[1:54:36] a children buyer wasn't even his wife
[1:54:38] living an adultery
[1:54:42] brother brim brought it up to him and he
[1:54:43] took off
[1:54:45] why he was anointed but the soul
[1:54:49] and we've seen a lot of that we've seen
[1:54:51] a lot of junk if I could say it that way
[1:54:55] that that really makes the the message
[1:55:00] a uh laughing stock
[1:55:04] is because people hadn't had a nature
[1:55:06] change
[1:55:08] can you say man
[1:55:10] but there's a people that
[1:55:14] has the Lord as their Shepherd
[1:55:16] they're not just going after the gifts
[1:55:18] they're not just going after the Thrills
[1:55:20] and the Frills they're not just going
[1:55:22] after anything
[1:55:24] the glittery things
[1:55:26] [Music]
[1:55:28] but their purpose
[1:55:30] is to be led
[1:55:32] and to fulfill
[1:55:33] all righteousness
[1:55:35] every promise that God spoke for this
[1:55:38] age
[1:55:39] must be fulfilled
[1:55:41] by you and I
[1:55:43] can you say man
[1:55:45] you love the Lord
[1:55:46] [Music]
[1:55:48] what song
