expecting to for the Lord to move and praise the Lord the musicians can be dismissed and it's just always good to be in the house of the Lord and if you have your Bibles we're going to turn to the Book of John praise the Lord the chapter 10. amen and um just want to remember the meetings that will be started this week brother Hunter's meeting will start this week and Brother David seiler's

this amen and appreciate them and good to have Mark again back with us amen and we've had some good discussions on over the phone and he's uh he's not heard of this message before and but he's seems eager to learn and want to know more about it and so we just pray that the Lord will help him and reveal things I I believe if a man is truly truly hunger and for the Lord God will help him and show him and reveal things to him and where we've we're so blessed to know what God has done in this age and it's not been something that God done in the corner but it's it's he's done this worldwide and the world has rejected it of course but the Bible says it would but there's an elect and uh that well the Bible Jesus said wherever the carcass is there where the Eagles be gathered and so I am honored that the Lord would choose me to to be part of the message of the hour and it's our life and and I just thank the Lord for it before we go into the word may we just bow our heads and talk to our Lord father that song is just stuck to my heart today Lord as you're more than enough you are Jehovah Jireh your Jehovah shaman you're everything Lord that we would have need of and father I may not know the needs but you do that are present here this morning that we're your children father and we're just asking that you would meet every need father those that have been sick father and our dear brother Sam struggling in his body this morning and father we're just asking you'd go to where he's at father and touch that body Lord I pray father that you would come in a special way this morning and just give your anointing let it fall among his father and help me just to get myself out of the way Lord and that you could speak through me father we desire that in Jesus Christ's name we pray and the church says amen and amen the John 10 10 it says the thief cometh not but for to steal to kill and to destroy I am come that they might have life and that they might have it more abundantly amen you can have your seats this morning and um I uh I again want to use the title Ministry and we've we've kind of talked on it and here past few Sundays I guess and and the ministry of God and it's not it's not man's Ministry it's God's Ministry and again the word ministry refers to an agent or an instrument a person or thing through which uh something is accomplished and and so uh we've talked about there's Ministries in the government by which uh uh things are carried out and laws are are enforced and and these things but behind it all there's a purpose and God has a purpose for Ministry he has a purpose he has a plan and um but in order for it to be carried out uh uh he needed an agent through which he could carry out his plan and his purpose and just to talk about that plan most of us are familiar with the plan uh of God but it's a Plan of Redemption and uh so so God wants this this this uh plan to be carried out and this this word redeemed uh uh it means to bring what has fallen to its original condition bring back uh it was there at one time and then it fell and then to bring it back and um I guess I I you know maybe the best way I could describe it uh and we've used this illustration before but um redeem my uh we we had a dog uh her name was Ginger it was a corgi and no one like that dog I thought it was cute and Purdy and uh and so uh but but it would follow us through town we lit Pawnee is just a little old town but is a mile or two from the store and uh we would go to the grocery store and uh we'd do a little shop and come out and Earth gender and I you know I've always puzzled me how did she know where we were but anyway uh anyway she she did but but she did roam around a lot you know and uh we tried to keep her in the fence but somehow she got out and that was before they had these Invisible Fences and all of that you know and uh and I I did never just felt that it was right to have a dog on it on a chain you know if I'm on keeping and do that put him in a zoo then but so I uh he got out and sure enough we we didn't she didn't show up for a few days and so we started looking around for ginger you know and and uh so we called the dog pound and sure enough they got her you know and uh so I I told my wife I said now I'm gonna go and I'm gonna go get her dog so now I'm going to go get her so now I'm gonna put myself as a redeemer because I'm going to bring back what was rightfully mine in the first place and so now she didn't have to worry about me bringing all kinds of dogs uh because I've got a specific purpose and that is to go get Ginger now no matter how ugly that dog was I I walk in and and there you know other dogs bigger badder you know uh some of them probably a man's dog you know nice German Shepherd or a uh whatever you know and and all that bit and and if you could think just for a minute of Ginger you know here she is a little old short-legged dog long Corgi you know so and uh but but if she she might have it just just thinking of for a moment she might have had a little complexes man what if he sees all these other dogs you know and he's gonna forget me you know what if they distract his attention and here I am just you know my bark ain't even as loud as these other dogs and I'm gonna try to grab her you know and it doesn't surprise that's what these other dogs are doing and and all these things see but she didn't have to worry about it it wasn't competition I came to redeem she was mine in the first place so it didn't matter about everything else I didn't come to shop I come to redeem I didn't come to replace I come to redeem right so a lot of times you know you you might break a picture or a plate or whatever well you say well I'm gonna go get me another one well that's fine but that's not redeeming that's only replacing and and uh uh you can even you can even replace the one that looks just exactly like the one that broke but it's still not Redemption that's just replacing and so God did not come to shop he didn't like we go to Walmart or go to Krogers or whatever to shop he didn't come to shop he did not come to this world to do any shopping the Bible says the foundation of God's standards sure the Lord knoweth them that are his so he come to redeem so you cannot be replaced he come to be your Redeemer no matter how low you are no matter how rotten you were no matter how deep in scum and and even in the in the in whatever you you chief of Sinners and and all of these things and the world kind of considered you a reject and maybe there's more talented people more better speakers more better this more better that but it didn't matter God come to redeem and so that's what Redemption is is to bring back that which had fallen in the beginning ain't that right so then we we find that the original condition of the believer is not what he was at Birth a man for as we've said so many times that we were all born in sin and shaping in iniquity uh conceived in sin so that wasn't your original condition uh as much as maybe a cutie pie you were and people pinched your cheeks and and you look so innocent and and Google you ain't total lie yet and all that but that's not your original condition so when he come to redeem he didn't bring you back as you were as a baby thank God for that right amen uh uh but but uh uh your original condition is what you were in God's mind before the foundation of the world a couple Sundays ago we talked of how that God uh wrote a select number of names on the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world and these names represent people uh uh who are the elect this is what the Bible would call them is the elect of God we also know that they they are the children of God these elect uh uh precious uh Peter would call them elect precious but uh uh uh the these these names this elect makes up the children of God which make up the Bride of Jesus Christ and and so we we look uh uh these are the ones that the Apostle Paul referred to when he uh uh said in Romans the 8th chapter and 29th verse for whom he did for no them that elect that he foreknew he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many Brethren whom are more over whom and and we know what that whom is that's them names that were written in the Lamb's Book of Life the elect the bride of Christ the children of God children of light uh for whom he did predestinate them he also called and all these words are past tense he did predestinate past tense then he called not calling called past tense and Justified and whom he them he all so glorified ain't that right so so it's already done he predestinated he called he justified and he glorified past tense when does he do that before the foundation of the world not when you come to an altar and gave your heart to the Lord ain't that right now and and so uh uh there uh now now the prophet would tell us the power that God had promised and ordained you and called you before the foundation of the world and put your name in his book you had nothing to do with it God did it aren't you glad for that can you say that with me God did it God did it amen you had nothing to do with it see in another place he says God before there was a world had you in mind he had a church in mind ain't that right and that church is made up of a group of people that have their names written in the Lamb's Book of Life Now John we know rights of another group of people they're in Revelations 13 4 and 8 but whose names were not written in the Lamb's Book of Life and he says this and they worshiped the dragon which is uh uh Satan and which gave power unto the Beast and they worshiped the Beast saying who is like unto the Beast who is able to make war with him ain't that right and then the eighth verse and all that dwell upon the Earth shall worship Him whose names are not written in the Book of Life of the lamb slain from the foundation of the world ain't that right so so there there's uh uh that that select group that have their names written in the Lamb's Book of Life a man that that God come to redeem and and these others that have knocked their names written in the Lamb's Book of Life uh are going to worship the Beast amen and uh uh the dragon and so uh those who have their names written in the Lamb's Book of Life is the the main focus of God God's main focus can you say that with me God's main focus are those who have their names written in the Lamb's Book of Life Now there will be others make it to heaven right we know that there's going to be those that going to be friends of the Bride Matthew 25 talks about it where Jesus will come to tell you know say to them you know when I was in prison you visited me when I was naked you clothed me when I was hungry you fed me and thirsty you gave me what drink and they said when did we do this and he said when you did it unto the least of these my brethren you did it unto me ain't that right so there will be those that will make it then then I believe in Matthew 25 as well it talks about the the wise versions which which is the bride of Christ that's got oil in their lamps these are the ones that have their name written in the Lamb's Book of Life and then there are the foolish virgins ain't that right amen and and the the prophet talked and talked about it like a woman you know she's got a material out there but she wants to make a dress so she gets her pattern and She lays it all the way she wants it see and then she begins to cut that dress out well it's all the dress right it's all part of the material see uh uh the the foolish virgin and the wise virgin they're all virgins that one's wise and one's foolish ain't that right but see the prophet says see all of this other is material but she's already cut her pattern out and she lays the rest of the material aside for something else later on ain't that right amen but right now she's working with the pattern that she's got elected out she's cut out see and so that's the way God is his main focus is upon his people whose names he wrote in the Lamb's Book of Life they are his elect they are his children he is Offspring ain't that right and so uh they are what the prophet would call the Eternal thoughts of God Amen the Eternal thoughts of God you see God is eternal and and his thoughts are Eternal therefore if you were in God's thinking from the foundation of the world then you were with him then Eternal in his mind ain't that right Eternal in his mind God God's Eternal and everything about him is eternal Eternal quality God cannot change he cannot have a new thought about anything for his thoughts are Eternal so you can't change anything about about if God called you you can't change it ain't that right so uh uh here the the the prophet would tell us God is infinite in his ability so therefore he as God must be omniscient if he is omniscient then he is not now learning or nor is he taking counsel with uh even with himself nor is he at any time adding to his knowledge if he can add to his knowledge then he is not omniscient see the best we could say that uh is that sometime he will be see but that is not scriptural he is everybody say he is omniscient see he has never had a new thought about anything because all his thoughts he has always had and always will have and knows the end from the beginning because he is God so that us the thoughts of God are Eternal and they are real they are not simply like a man with the blueprint he has drawn up and which one day will be translated into substance and form no that's not God's thoughts see notice but they are already real can you say Amen they are already real and eternal and part of God so that's God's thoughts they are real they're more real than you sitting here right now they're more real than you uh being a sinner that God's thoughts are more real than anything you say well I've got mistakes but his thoughts are more real than your mistakes well you say well I got issues well his his thoughts are more real than your issues can you say amen amen we're living in a in a in a place that is temporary that's gonna that's gonna lead that's going to vanish that's gonna end but there is an eternal power word of God and that starts with his thoughts and eternal thought of God now notice the thoughts of God Eternal Jeremiah 29 11 God speaks through that prophet and says I know the thoughts that I think towards you well what are they Eternal thoughts ain't that right saith the Lord thoughts of peace and not of evil to give you an expected end ain't that right so when did all this trans uh uh happen in the mind of God in his thoughts you realize as I said so many times you were holy before you ever become Unholy you were saved before you ever become unsaved you say well I was a born I was born a sinner well we all were born a sinner but that's not your beginning your beginning was in the mind of god of what he thought of you before the foundation of the world ain't that right well it's true a man's seat so these are Eternal thoughts and and we'll set this way you are if I say I am a premeditated thought of God not just a passing thought not just something that just come into your mind it's a premeditated thought there's a difference in just murder on an instinct someone just killed somebody out of instinct or out of just out of uh spontaneous but then there's those that that really paid the crime or should good of premeditated they they thought this thing out they they done everything you know and and and and I mean they done it by the book you know and they're premeditating it on how they're going to do it what weapon they're going to do it when they're gonna do it and everything ain't that right well if if Satan can do that through a man uh with murder and whatever else what about God God he's been alone he he's the prophet said he dwelt alone with his thoughts his thoughts ain't that right he wasn't just sitting up there just dumbfounded you know just just with nothing there you know some people just sit there and just with nothing you know and he's like you know well that wasn't God he was dwelling with his thoughts and they were premeditated thoughts ain't that right well premeditated it it it it it uh uh if I can get my uh uh screen to work here uh it says characterized by fully conscious this is what premeditated means fully conscience willful intent and a measure of forethought and planning ain't that right so the prophet would call it premeditated thoughts God was fully conscience when he thought of you he was fully aware when he began to plan your life he was fully conscious and he thought and he planned with intent he planned with purpose he not accidental there's nothing accidental with God ain't that right see so characterized by fully conscience willful intent and a measure of forefoot thought and planning so Ephesians 1 4 Paul would tell us according as he hath chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy everybody say I should be holy and Without Blame before him in love when did that start in his mind can you say Amen having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ according to or to himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he hath made us accepted in the Beloved man that's awesome in whom we have Redemption through his blood ain't that right amen see the Forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace so when did he make us accepted in the Beloved before the foundation of the world not when you got gave got gave your heart to the Lord not not even when when when Christ died at Calvary you was accepted in the Beloved in the beginning before the world began amen when did we have Redemption through his blood before the foundation of the world you say well I know you know people get smart and they say well yeah but but the blood wasn't shed until this but the Bible says that the lamb was slain before the foundation of the world so God took care of everything before the foundation of the world ain't that right see when did we have the Forgiveness of sins before the foundation of the world it was all in God's plan it was a Redemptive plan Plan of Redemption see so is the premeditated thoughts of God and they are Eternal and they are real yeah God God had always had his thoughts for Adam but yet his thoughts wasn't expressed because Adam wasn't created that right God dwelt Alone with his thoughts so here we we look in Psalms 139 15 and 16 it gives us a little idea of this but it says my substance was not hit from thee when I was made in secret and curiously wrought in the lowest parts of the earth Thine Eyes did see my substance yet being unperfect and in thy book all my members were written which in continuance were fashioned when as yet there was none of them ain't that right so God did not just think of you when you happen to be born that he already had you in his mind that elect yes sir so this scripture gives us the knowledge that the thought the thought of us was there in his mind that thought was eternal and had to be expressed it had to be expressed it couldn't just remain as a thought it had to be expressed that's why there is no devil big enough to hold you back there's no sin great enough to keep a child uh down in in the pits and the the filth amen because there's an assault and it's an eternal thought and that thought had to be expressed [Music] thought so when Adam was formed out of the earth and his spiritual being created by God then Adam uh uh see was was God's thought expressed and those thoughts were manifested see so so Adam became not it wasn't just a thought now but he become a manifestation or expression of God's thoughts ain't that right and and we find that Moses Jeremiah David Daniel um uh all the all of them uh John the Baptist they were God's Eternal thoughts expressed in in its season ain't that right see so by God's thoughts already having that that's why he could tell he foretolded John the Baptist uh uh uh uh before way before he came do you realize that the Bible foretells of a bride of you in this age there's more scriptures that speak of this age than ever than any other age but God could do it because they're Eternal thoughts and they had to be expressed ain't that right see so we are any Eternal thought a man as well for we were chosen in him Christ before the foundation of the world that means the prophet says that we were right there with him with him in the mind and thoughts of God before the foundation of the world ain't that right when when the prophets come and they spoke of Messiah to come and and all these they God already had Jesus Christ in mind it wasn't just a guesswork well now let's see you know who's going to be the better pick when that time comes I I don't know we'll just have to wait and see no Jesus Christ was what God had in his thoughts and then when he come to this earth he become the expression ain't that right amen that's true he was the word made flesh and so so then so so brother Brown says see that that means that we were right there with him Christ in the mind and thoughts of God before the foundation World notice that gives an eternal quality to the elect you can't get away from that it's what he says for people that don't believe in the predestination and the the well you take the power of God away from him you take sovereignty of God away you you diminish God in in such a low form to say that he can't predestinate and he can't he can't control I don't care how bad this world gets there's not one elect that's going to be lost for Jesus said all that the father hath given me or will come to me and I will not lose one of them for this is the Father's will can you say amen amen says so now again uh uh Revelations 13 8 tells us that the lamb was slain before the foundation of the world he was a premeditated thought of God but it never happened until 4 000 years later ain't that right it took 4 000 years for that thought of God to become materialized or expressed amen but Jesus wasn't there by accident he knew where he was from the beginning and neither is God's elect today so the prophet says but when but God when he spoke it he had to do it can you say that with me he had to do it when God spoke it he had to do it because he has to keep his word and the same time that the lamb uh uh uh was wrote down he said you were wrote down with him amen the same time at the Lamb's name was written down we're going to say it that way or the lamb was slain before the foundation of the world a man you were written with him you were identified with him ain't that right that's why God can't you weren't identified in your first birth you you come as a sinner but that's not what your identification you come trapped in sin but that's just not your dead identification you were identified before the foundation of the world with your lamb that God had provided for you see our names were written in the Lamb's Book of Life not the night we come to Christ but before the foundation of the world ain't that right so when the lamb was slain before the foundation of the world in the mind of God our names was associated with him amen see and notice what the prophet said Christ died to save those who God by foreknowledge elected to meet him Yonder without spot or wrinkle you realize that that the Bible already speaks of you that says there would be a bride without spot wrinkle or a blemish amen it's it's already done it's already settled it's it's it's in God's mind it's it's already done it's and they're real more real than you're sitting here so don't don't try to bring up your faults before God get them under the blood of course amen but but don't try to bring up all your excuses as to why you can't do things amen I'm telling you God's already already taken care of it it's already written it's already been spoke now you're here expressing it [Applause] [Music] if God if Prophet says if God predestinate us before the foundation of the world and knew every one of us by name before the foundation world and he elected us to eternal life and sent Jesus to redeem us that 6 000 years ago he saw us that we might appear uh to his Praises in glory notice the question after that how can you ever be lost ain't that right now again brother Branham says well one might say well then that means I can do anything I want to do then that's Baptist Doctrine that's that's what they think that you can do once they've always saved and we believe that to an extent but you gotta get safe first God get sealed with the Holy Ghost first a man see and then when you get the Holy Ghost it takes all that desire for sin out you used to want to cuss you don't cuss no more you used to want to party don't want to don't want to party no more there's your Associates change everything about you changes and the more you grow and the more you mature in Christ you're going to find things start with the things just start falling off amen if if you say well man I got crave for movies and I'll just get in Christ and grow in Christ and you'll watch you won't want them no more you you won't crave it Satan will try to tempt you and you just say I don't want that no more I just there's just something about it I don't want see what is it you're coming to an expression of God you're you're coming to what he thought of you in the beginning ain't that right now if that desire keeps remaining there and it's just staying there and and there's not a change in you then then then then I I just have to tell you you need the Holy Ghost you need the Holy Ghost because you cannot have the Holy Ghost and still remain in the pig pen just can't I I I'm just that's just the truth amen uh uh you you can hold on to your your Baptist ways your Pentecostal ways and and and your charismatic ways or whatever amen but but when when it comes to Redemption you you got to go back to what God called you to be in the first place people that says well I got the Holy Ghost I'm redeemed and don't go like church don't want to go to church and all that something wrong with that something wrong with that relationship ain't that right and it's just just going to be honest with you it's just wrong people that said well I got the Holy Ghost blessed God and but you desire to drink and you want to go out there but I can't do it because I'm a Christian something wrong with your experience we don't serve God because we're afraid to go to hell [Applause] we're serving God because he came and redeemed us he come to redeem us hey man it's true see so so then six thousand years ago before the foundation of the world he saw us aren't you glad for that he saw us then why would it bother people now think of that why would it bother people when a prophet in this day went beyond the curtain of time and and he and he's up there and he sees the people out there uh in another land in another dimension and and and then he comes back and tells tells us I saw I saw you there I saw you there well what was it was it a man just trying to dream something up and give us a little hope no it's a reality it's reality can you say man now the Jesus came to redeem those that were in the book he come to redeem now Revelations 5 talks about how the lamb came and took the book from him that set upon the throne Revelations 5 and 1 starting there and I saw in the right hand of him that said on the throne a book written within and on the back side sealed with Seven Seals now I'll say it this way that's your Lamb's Book of Life amen the book has been opened ain't that right because John says I shouted all in heaven heard me all in the Earth all in the sea and and everybody All Creatures heard me shouting amen glory and Hallelujah and honor and the prophet said he must have saw his name in the book amen so we're going to call it Lamb's Book of Life that was opened up can you say man that's right see and and he says I saw a strong angel proclaiming with the loud voice who is worthy to open the book and to loose the seals thereof no man in Heaven Nor in Earth neither under the Earth was able to open the book neither to look thereupon and I wept I went much because no man was found worthy to open and to read the book neither to look there upon and one of the elders saith unto me wheat not Behold The Lion of the tribe of Judah the root of David hath prevailed there there was a wrestling there there was a fight there was a struggle right Satan was claiming your soul Satan was saying here no they're damned they're doomed I got him I got him in a stronghold that the lamb prevailed and he opened the book and he says no Satan they're mine they're an eternal thought of mine before the foundation of the world ain't that right you can't have them you got to break your hold and and that's when we find out that there is an enforcer called the Holy Ghost a man that if he won't if that devil won't get out of your home he won't get out of your life and he's squatting on your property you've got every right go to the Holy Ghost go to the one that'll enforce it and he'll make him give it up he'll make him give give all of that up why the book has been opened you see your name in the book you're not guessing if you're going to make it you know you're going to make it you're not guessing wondering if you're safe you know you're saved ain't that right amen I I know Satan fights us on these things as you know and you know hey I'm I'm one of them that do fight in in my mind and things like that I think we we well we might all I guess but but I am one of them that Satan tries to tell me a lot of stuff tell me you cross the line can you imagine you crossed the line amen there's no more grace for you and I fight that just as well amen well you'll never overcome you'll never do this you'll never do that you're going to fall short of of these things and might as well give up and and there ain't no more hope and and I mean just you know there's battles there that we all face amen but I look back and I say no no no this message means more than just a man preaching to me I see my name in a book I see that every promise in this book is mine and I'm going to claim it let Satan get away from me healing his mind salvation is mine Redemption is mine Deliverance is mine the Rapture is mine the body changes mind amen everything that God promised me is mine can you say Amen I'm an heir of every promise that God has made me and you know the prophet also said I was reading a quote to the church uh uh down there last week brother Brown said if you're a Son of God then you're an heir to everything that God is that God is not that God has you're an heir to everything that God is can you say Amen Hallelujah that's right see so the the book has been opened the lamb has prevailed now just for simple terms this book this Bible now this this may not have your name written on it where you can plainly see it but see it talks about you and this book has been sealed up before the foundation of the world and people have guessed at it teachers have probed at it trying to understand this book that has never been able to understand amen the contents of the book it took the lamp to open the book in other words to open our understanding that we're not reading the Bible we're not teaching the Bible we're not preaching and behind the pulpit today a man without understanding of what this really says we're not preaching according to man's interpretation a man's ideologies and man's this and man's that no no no we are seeing the book for what it really is and it's calling us and it's telling us every promise in this Bible is yours it's a love letter and you say man so that book again was sealed with Seven Seals no one could understand it it was a mystery God's plan God's purpose was a mystery ain't that right yeah that's right and the lamb came and opened the book why why would he open the book so to claim all everybody say all to claim all that he had redeemed that's why he wants you to serve him in love walk with him love it's a love story right you talk about coming to the end of the Cinderella story they lived happily ever after buddy this already tells your Victory this already tells your end and I'm telling you we're going to live happily ever after he come for you he come to claim you it's Redemption claim he redeems you at Calvary brother Doug he's here to claim you now to let you know that you're in the book can you say man so it's not living our Christian Life worrying about what we are worry and worry and Satan tries to put that worry and put that fear that God has not given us the spirit of fear every fear is of the devil fear is of the devil questions are of the devil can you say Amen well I wonder if God loves me I wonder if I'm really going to make a quit thinking them things quit let the devil plant them things in your mind oh yeah it's just you say well I can't help it you know and and we've used that illustration so many times of of you know you you you you you can't keep a bird from flying over your head but you could sure keep him from building a nest in your hair ain't that right and a lot of times you can't help thoughts that go in your mind but you can sure keep them from being rooted in your mind you don't have to dwell on that ain't that right see so so we we find the lamb came and opened the book so to claim all that he had redeemed I'm telling you those that have their names on the that's his Focus brother Brown said all whose name was written on the Lamb's Book of Life is redeemed redeemed he says God had to open up those Seven Seals not in a denomination he said I've always been against it that out of denomination he might take a bride not a denominational bride he couldn't do it it's against his own word he opened those seven mysteries in there that shows forth brings forth those things that's been hid since the foundation of the world might be revealed in the last days to who the sons of God the world ain't going to understand they ain't want nothing to do with it but it's revealed to sons of God that elect those who have their names written in the book of Lamb's Book of Life ain't that right he says now he says see they brought that forth now before the people and they see it there the book has been opened up before the people and they see it the mysteries of God that's been shut up sealed up now has been presented and the the people the sons of God see it there he says see he says uh he says they brought back now before the people that they see it there you now he says uh to this undenominational bride undenominational not denominational undenominational he said there's your two books one of them is the Lamb's Book of Life your name on there is predestinated on it can't go because you can no more take that away than anything Satan can't take that name away [Music] because it was foreordained to be on there now the regular Book of Life can take that off anytime and and you know some of you may not understand that but that's okay just keep that in mind he said see so you don't repent he said it's off anyhow because you're going to stand judgment but the bride everybody say the bride the Alexi don't even stand the Judgment it goes in the rapture is this okay it goes in the Rapture now notice we've talked about it last time we've spoke on this subject is that at the white Throne judgment the books are going to be opened according to Daniel 7 9 and 10. and Revelations 20 and 12-13 the books are going to be open but not it at least the way I'm seeing it is not the Lamb's Book of Life hello why because that book is the book of redemption and it's already open it's already open ain't that right you are being judged now but you have not just as a sinner you have representation it's the Lambs Book of Life it's his life that represents you can you say Amen so God cannot see you as a sinner there's a blood that's covering you and the life of the Lamb is in you you're spotless you're free your Clans can you say Amen because you've got a representation the lawyer that represented you has now come to live in you then you say man he not only took your place and died for you as the substitute so you wouldn't have to die but now he come back and lives in you it's Christ in you the hope of glory Christ in you that lives Christ can you say man now the life that I now live I live by the faith of the son of God I don't live a sinner life brother Brown said your old life by the blood of Christ your sexual blood has been dismissed amen man that's why you had to be born again ain't that right you love the Lord so that book is the book of redemption and it's already open notice before the foundation of the world God wrote your name in the Lamb's Book of Life by his spoken word so he's going to deal with all those that that that have their name written in the book of life but right now he's dealing with us that elect who has their names written in the Lamb's Book of Life that book is open now ain't that right so he said see God wrote your name in the Lamb's Book of Life by his spoken word and sent Christ the sacrifice to buy to redeem that same group that had wrote that he had wrote their names in the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world now those who he has called he has Justified he called them before the foundation of the world and those who he called he justified and those he have Justified he hath already glorified the same God that before the foundation of the world called your name and wrote it on the Lamb's Book of Life but from the foundation of the world has already everybody say he has already made a place for you in glory now that ought to just take the pressure off he's already prepared a place for you in glory have you ever just gone somewhere and you want to get there early some people do that here church so he can get their favorite seat did you go somewhere and and if you don't have a ticket with with seat numbers I I want to get there early if I really want to get a good seat you know and and you know you hope you hope that there's a seat for you now there are some times I go to places and I don't get the right seat sometimes I'm made to sit up front you know and you know and but but then if we're going to go to a you know a gospel concert or whatever and you know I'll ask and say well do they already have our seats assigned yeah ah takes the pressure off I don't have to block somebody's eyes knock them out so I can get their seat you know it's uh it's it's mine it's paid for it and have you ever been to a place where your seat's been assigned and someone sits in your seat and you just kindly smile you can smile you can actually be friendly at this point because it's your seat so you just say can't you move this is my seat or you kind of act dumb uh I don't know but I think that might be my seat I don't know so we're all looking you know but you already know it's your seat because you got the ticket well when we go in the Rapture it's not going to be a rush to get a seat [Music] every every every chair has been assigned at that wedding supper [Music] and no one no one can take my place no one can take your place ain't that right gonna be love and joy over there because you already got a seat assigned and nobody gonna be sitting in that seat because he has already prepared a place it ain't switching bodies and theophanies and all that trying to find which one's yours and all that he's already got a place prepared everything is yours it's designed and he just welcomes you says I've been waiting on you everything's prepared your seed is ready this is ready that's ready I prepared it all for you he's already prepared a place for you in glory notice he says and when this Earthly Tabernacle be dissolved which Paul says that we have one already can you say that already waiting for us in the way he's fashioned there he are that's the gospel so in another place he says in the last days when the Antichrist raised up on the scene so close like the real thing it would deceive the very elected if it was possible but then he said again he deceived all upon the Earth whose names were not written on the Lamb's Book of Life slain before the foundation of the world see their names were put on The Book of Life the book of redemption so he's telling us what section of the book it is written on and Jesus come to redeem those that had their names in the book and when that last name is redeemed the lamb takes the book and walks away that's all redemption's over it's closed ain't that right so see if your name is written on the book the Lamb's Book of Life then you don't worry about it you come to arrest ain't that right don't worry about anything else brother Branham in speaking of the Samaritan woman said she was the one she was one that had her name there and no matter what kind of a state she was in there as soon as that true Gospel Light struck that little prostitute she recognized it why there was something in there to spark it off and she recognized it how many is recognized oh I recognized it I wasn't seeing I was this I was that but I recognized it now then we find and and we're very familiar with this bit Revelations 10 and 1. it says and I saw another Mighty angel uh come down I don't know if that's this mic or what that worked and I saw another Mighty Angel come down from heaven clothed with the cloud and a rainbow was upon his head and his face was as it were the Sun and his feet as pillars of Fire and he had in his hand a little closed book a little open book why this is the in the fifth chapter of Revelations the lamb come to open it now here he is with the with the book in his hand and it's open and he said his right foot upon the Earth his left foot up on on the sea and cried with a loud voice as when a lion roared and when he had cried seven Thunders uttered their voices see now notice brother Branham says if now if you were in the quickening at his beginning that's what he come to redeem and your name was put on the Lamb's Book of Life in his thinking at the beginning and he come to redeem all names that's in that book no more not one more just what was in there and when the last name is redeemed he takes his book and he claims what he has redeemed then you say man now I know uh uh this this quote might be a little lengthy but I want to read it but it says now now the forfeited title deed is now in the hands of the original owner almighty God the title deed to the Earth to eternal life and when Adam forfeited it then Satan's dirty hands could not take it so it went back to its original owner God himself we're going to find out he says see there he sits on the throne with it in his hand the title deed see so oh that makes me feel religious friends the title deed to eternal life the abstract title deed to eternal life when Adam forfeited it for wisdom instead of faith and went back to the hands it went back to the hands of the owner almighty God what a great thing all right what's it doing it's in the hands of God waiting for Redemption claims he made a way of redemption he made a way back and someday the Redeemer is to take it back you see what we're getting to now watch he said we'll watch this fella setting up on the throne waiting for Redemption claims what is the book of redemption it's the title lead it's the abstract titled deed and you say man you say abstract what does abstract means it means it's searched all the way back to its beginning see Satan has tried to accuse us Satan he's the accuser of the brother and that's what the Bible says but the abstract has been given back there's no accusation what what has been said is we've been Justified as though we've never done it in the first place ain't that right so see he says it searched all the way back like that little drop of ink this morning when it struck that bleach it went all the way back and when sin has been confessed and fallen into the blood of Jesus Christ it gives an abstract right straight back to the Creator again and you become a Son of God Abstract title deed is held in the hand of Almighty it's Redemption everybody say it's Redemption means all legal possession to all that was lost by Adam and Eve he said oh my what that ought to do to a born-again Christian it's legal possession to the abstract titled deed of eternal life means that you possess everything that Adam and Eve lost you possess it can you say man so so if I can set this way don't worry about being lost now you when I'm saying that now they've asked Peter what do we what must we do to be saved and he gives the he gives the formula repent be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ every one of you for the remission of sins and you shall receive the Holy Ghost ain't that right these three things when you get the Holy Ghost you're sealed the Paul says to the day of your Redemption ain't that right so don't live your Christian Life being tossed to and fro you don't have to worry about a thing it's yours now look to claim claim everything that God has given you in this age can you say man that's right see because if your name is there it can never be removed and and uh uh I'll tell you what is removed it's your transgressions what is removed is not your name it's your transgressions can you say man notice Psalms 103 and 10 he has not dealt with us after our sins nor rewarded us according to our iniquities for as high as for as the heaven is high above the earth now go measure the how high the heaven is on the Earth so great is his Mercy toward them that fear him as far as the East is from the West so far has he removed our transgressions from us oh do you love him so he did not just just separate you from your transgressions and your transgressions is right here huh you know with you all your life he removed them from you as far as the East is from the West amen I just love God loving so the prophet says who could tell God how to make things in the beginning when there was just him alone and and if we have eternal life there's only one form of eternal life and that's God so if we have eternal life we were with God right then a part of God we were his attributes we are now his attribute and because in the beginning was the word and a word is a thought expressed so we were his thoughts then expressed into word and become what we are that's the reason our names maybe not what we have now but our names were put on the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world and if it wasn't there then it'll never be now and you say man and Jesus come to redeem all those whose names are were on that book now we we could go on but here the whole again the whole Plan of Redemption is for those names that God wrote before the foundation of the world and brother Brandon said this it was God's purpose can you say that with me it was God's purpose to bring forth a people like unto himself that would be a word bride that's his purpose she was chosen before the foundation of the world in him I'm going to change microphones see if she was chosen before the foundation of the world in him she was foreknown and beloved before she was ever brought forth during the ages upon the Earth she was Redeemed by his blood and can never come into condemnation she can never be in the Judgment because sin cannot be imputed to her uh what a blessing it is to be his elect Romans 4 8 blessed is the man to whom the Lord will not impute sin but indeed she shall be with him in his throne of judgment judging the world and even angels her name each of her members was written in a section of the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world can you say man now I'm I'm getting somewhere I've been laying this thing to get somewhere here but our name as the prophet said was there by the spoken word of God and the word is is what a thought expressed it enters as a thought and then it becomes a word amen uh uh can't speak anything until it becomes a thought and then it processes the word well God spoke our name it was a thought it became a war expression by word ain't that right amen and and in Isaiah 55 and 1 God said the word that go forth out of my mouth shall not return unto me void but it shall accomplish that which I please and it shall prosper in the thing whereto I sent it ain't that right so this is God's purpose a word bride that elect Redemption bring him back all of these things is dealing with the with the elect of God this means that God has an agent to make sure that his word is accomplished and that it will prosper in the thing that he sent it ain't that right see so he has a Ministry whereby his will his purpose his agenda is accomplished now this word agent or agency again is the capacity condition or state of acting uh or of exerting power it's an operation a person or thing through which power is exerted or an end is achieved ain't that right so the ministry or the agency of God through that agency through that in Ministry a man the the the purpose of God will come to uh uh uh to be accomplished it'll be brought to pass so the ministry or the agency of God has full Authority are you with me has full Authority so to bring that word to pass we have talked about the angels of God being part of the ministry of God because I I believe in the ministry of angels amen and and they are messengers of God and and are sent of God to watch over his believing children and and here Psalms 91 and 9 it says because thou Hast made the Lord which is my refuge even the most high thy habitation there shall no evil befall thee neither shall any plague come nigh thy dwelling for he shall give his angels charge over thee to keep thee in all thy ways ain't that right the prophet said the angels are watching over us day and night they never leave they are in Camp to Bow and we can expect God to do most anything at any time because of the presence of the angels of God who are commissioned by him to watch us and to care for us can you say Amen so so God's uh uh uh uh uh Ministry there see and and another place he says they are with us to minister spiritual blessings to us and to help us along the road and encourage us as we see the the heel of Zion Yonder inside ain't that right so so we we find that the angels of God I believe they're here this morning and they're encamped about these pews they're in they're encamped by you and and they're helping you Prophet said they're helping us to believe they're they're they're giving us a faith they're they're inspiring us ain't that right they give us a charge they're they're making sure that God's word is carried out but as I've stated that the angels are limited in what they can do they cannot create they cannot mediate or intercede for us they cannot redeem they cannot bring man into fellowship with God they cannot secure our soul God never send Angels uh to live inside of us so then God has another agency and or an agent and that is the Holy Ghost ain't that right that's God's agent look uh uh Genesis 1 and 2 it says and the Earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep and the spirit of God see the spirit of God the Holy Spirit moved upon the face of the waters see God's agent and God said let there be light and there was light ain't that right see so the holy spirit being God's agent it it takes the word of God and makes it live for he is the enforcer of God's law of God's word if you need healing amen God's agent the holy spirit is here to give it to you if you need Deliverance God's agent the holy spirit is here to give it to you ain't that right every Redemptive promise Belongs to You amen and God's holy spirit amen is here amen as his agent to give everything that you have need of ain't that right so we have talked about it um John 16 and 12 I have yet many things to say to you but you cannot bear them now how be it when he the spirit of Truth has come he will guide you into Old Truth for he shall not speak of himself but whatsoever he shall hear that shall he speak and he will show you things to come what God's agent ain't that right amen he shall glorify me for he shall receive of mine and shall show it unto you all things that the father hath are mine therefore said I that he shall take of mine and shall show it to you why he is God's agent amen that has been given to us ain't that right he is the one who has come in this day and revealed the mysteries of God to us why it's it's the ministry of God ain't that right and and the spirit of God that lives inside of us amen it lives inside of me lets me know that I am heir to all the promises of God why he's God's agent ain't that right he's God's agent and and Romans 8 16 says the spirit itself bearth witness with our spirit that we are the children of God have you ever just gone through your discouragements then just something just begins to rise up in you I am a Son of God well that's the holy spirit inside of you telling you and confirming to you that you're a child of God he's God's agent it's true God God doesn't leave leave his people without nothing it's our comforter it's our hope it's our help and you say Amen he said you was baptized by the grace of God into this great big arcade that's got every Redemptive blessings in it Everything Jesus died for is right here in the body of Christ healing salvation joy peace all these things belong to you it's yours well let the devil say oh don't you do it don't you do it well that's that old nasty Porter at the door don't you believe in that see walk right on in it's yours you've got a pass then you say man see you've got an abstract Deed on the place if sickness dwells in there it in in there you've got an abstract deed if you went home tonight and what if there's an enemy sitting in your house and the enemy said now wait a minute this house is built for a human being it's mine just as much as is your home see I'm just as much as a human being as you are but see you can walk right down to the courts get your abstract deed and show him this is my property it belongs to me praise the Lord that's right make that right now I I'm gonna be honest I I believe this thing's of the devil uh uh that's inspiring things today to where if you you you rent you you renting something a house you own that house but you rented out to somebody and then you they ain't paying their bills and they ain't paying their rent and all that and you want them to get out and they say I don't have to and you can't do nothing about it you know and basically they can own that house and or squatters rights or or whatever see and I I think that's that's just a a perversion of but but I'm telling you as a Believer them laws don't work when it comes to Heaven it does not work when it comes to the kingdom of God you have every right to tell that thing that devil that demon get out of my life get out of my home get out of whatever and he has to do it by your words can you say man so he says when you serve warning on the devil then he's got to get his nasty self camped on God's Property see he's got to get out he said if he don't get out don't want to get out just call on the authorities of Heaven God's law agent the Holy Ghost and he'll throw him out yes sir it's your property every Divine promise in the Bible belongs to every Christian do you believe that so that's God's agency is the Holy Ghost but then we look and just briefly here as we get ready to close that we see that man is God's agent as well God doesn't fall on mechanical or devices he doesn't fall on denominations the Holy Spirit falls upon men Abraham was God's agent Elijah was God's agent uh Jeremiah all the prophets of old Abraham uh David and and and all these men John Jesus even was God's agent and and in every generation God speaks to his people through human lips can you say Amen this word agent is a representative representative uh Emissary or official of a government one that acts or exerts power something that produces or is capable of producing an effect ain't that right so there's something behind this agent that has the ability to produce effectiveness see it's it's an active or if uh efficient calls a means or instrument by which a guiding intelligence achieves a result one an agent is one who is authorized to act for or in the place of another ain't that right so now now notice brother Branham explains the purpose of ministry and I I I I think this is is good he says we're trying to get every so saved so that Jesus can come and he cannot come until that last one that has the name of the book of life that was put there before the foundation of the world when that name is called that's the last one then he come to redeem to bring back redeem is to bring back and when he brings that last one in he's sitting at the right hand of God tonight doing his militarial work and when that last Soul was saved that was redeemed and seen and known by God before the foundation or when that last Soul was saved that closes the book can you say Amen that closes the book now I I'm thinking of this ministry uh as as we wind down we understand that there's there's three there were three Ministries in the days of lot ain't that right three Ministries all together that was going on at the same time and and uh there were the two angels uh that that were sent down uh to Sodom and Gomorrah and they went down to get locked out of Sodom ain't that right and we noticed that they blinded they blinded the the citizens of Sodom now lot represents the carnal believer ain't that right so let's put the Ministries in perspective amen lot represents the carnal believer and the angels went down to Sodom but then there was another angel now them two angels had their Ministries but then there was another Angel which was God himself Melchizedek that stayed there with Abraham which was God's elect ain't that right now Melchizedek was none other than God himself in human flesh Paul says he had no beginning he had no ending of days beginning of Life ending of life ain't that right and what was Abraham Abraham was elected and called of God not lot it was Abraham that God made an unconditional Covenant to not lot not lot never did receive a visitation from God but Abraham did Melchizedek coming to the Earth being made flesh God being made flesh was strictly for Abraham to give a promise of life to Abraham ain't that right so notice the difference in the Ministries see now lot lot never had had a visitation he was never called out of out of Sodom or out of out of the land of UR like Abraham was amen lot went just for the ride ain't that right and and the prophet said God never did uh uh bless Abraham until he fully separated from lot ain't that right so now notice as we we most of us know but Luke 17 28 it says as it was in the days of lot they did eat they drank they bought they sold they planted they build it now they're doing that just right now right we're in that same day but the same day that lot went out of Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven and destroyed them all even thus shall it be when in the day when the son of man is revealed ain't that right now how many believe we're living in the days of lot we're living in them days now so then we've had a a a a a a Prophet come in this day and he tells us and he compared amen the two angels just like it was in in Sodom we've had two angels uh uh or well three but but two uh angels that that had the ministry to the Sodom and to this world and that was brother Branham called it Billy Graham and Oral Roberts and their Ministries are are uh uh compared to that of the two angels that went down to Sodom he says There came up Three Angels and one of them was God ain't that right and so he sit down with Abraham and two of them went down and Sodom and preached the gospel to them is that right a modern Billy Graham to the church nominal that's in Sodom great men like that Oral Roberts going down there and Performing see they didn't do much of a miracle not too many they did something smiting the people blind and the preaching of the Gospel smites there they was in that denominational realm down there preaching uh the gospel see Billy Graham that Mighty uh Great Mighty evangelist through the Baptists and Presbyterians and all of these things oh he lays the line down to them but you see he preached to them calling them out but then there was one that stayed behind with Abraham and he gave Abraham a sign now we all know this as or most as Believers of the Gospel that that same sign that Melchizedek showed Abraham we have received in this day and and and and I'll just go through it right fast but that that sign uh uh was that uh God Melchizedek God in flesh told Abraham said you're going to have a son I'm gonna bless you amen and Sarah the Bible says was in the tent behind him and she laughed within herself she didn't go ha ha ha she snickered with the inner self and and Melchizedek looked at Abraham and said why did Sarah laugh ain't that right why did she laugh and she says oh I didn't laugh he said but you did laugh see he discerned the very heart that of her her actions and and everything well we've had in this day a man by a prophet God would come down amen and discern the very hearts and intents of the uh of the heart the thoughts ain't that right so we've had a visitation just like Abraham did God manifested In the Flesh and we received the same sign this message that we have received is to the elect do you believe it it's a Ministry amen so here amen so so we're looking here and and again we're trying to get every so saved so that Jesus can come he cannot come until that last one that has in the name written on the book of life that was put there before the foundation of the world can you say Amen so what is the ministry looking for the names amen hello this message is not for everybody ain't that right I don't believe that brother Brandon wasted his time going seven times around the world I don't believe that these these tapes and these these uh the messages uh uh being spread out through the world is in vain it's God looking for that last seed that had his name written on the Lamb's Book of Life ain't that right now notice what brother Brown said when the last name comes out that was put on the Lamb's Book of Life see that was slain before the foundation of the world when that last name has been redeemed his work is finished he comes forth to claim what he has redeemed now that makes our heart bleed but if it went on for a thousand years later there would not be one redeemed if God would wait for another ten thousand years and we all preach and we're all doing the same and if there's if the name of that on that that book amen has already been called there's can never be another one saved I know that's deep you know I mean maybe a little rough but that's okay we're just it's Bible can you say amen God is not currently adding names to the book he's already done that ain't that right see so then as message Believers and I'm I'm going to put all of this as as as part of this ministry in one way or another but as message Believers we are as responsible to get this message out can you say Amen we aren't to water this mess is down so that we don't offend somebody are you with me we aren't supposed to just to take this message and hide it so that we won't scare people brother Branham you know if he was the Forerunner of this message he's the one that brought the message and he didn't he didn't care he loved people and you know he did he never wavered one time bringing this message knowing that it would cost him his ministry knowing that the church would kick him out knowing that he would just be despised he would lose friendship but he stay true to this message then what about us we're going to water down the message so we don't offend so we don't be as odd so we don't scare or we don't run people off the ministry is God's Ministry we are God's agents and you say Amen see The Messengers that went down the lot they didn't have a message for Abraham their message was to locked but the one that stayed with Abraham he had a message of promise ain't that right God was with Abraham amen a man isn't going to have influence on a soul that has their name written in the Lamb's Book of Life by preaching some watered-down social gospel [Music] you say man I'm trying to show you his message believers as what Ministry you have because man is part of the ministry of God which makes him a representative God he's the one that is acting instead of God instead of God can you say Amen he's the one that acts or exerts the power see we as the Church of the Living God are not to be powerless all right lay down and you say Amen we're not to be powerless we're not to let the devil take away our the supernatural out of our lives out of our churches out of our homes out of whatever amen because when he does that we become formal and if you look at the ministry of God it's never been formal it's been with power and demonstration of the Holy Ghost can you say Amen amen I just believe that do you love the Lord amen if the musicians will come we could go on and on Amen but I hope it's been some type of a help to you and we'll we'll carry on at another time but we we the Church of the Living God is not to be powerless why because men and women whom God is called to be his agents in this day are capable of producing an effect are you with me if you're part of the Church of the Living God you're part of his ministry mothers are part of the ministry of God you don't have to stand there helpless and once the devil take your children and and and and Destroy them amen hello as preachers we don't have to stand helpless as as lay members don't have to stand helpless as men fathers husbands we don't have to stand there helpless we're agents of God but the full Authority why because God speaks through man God uses men how else is that last name going to come forth by men that has preached this gospel by people that have shared this message had the burden for Souls and you say Amen yes sir I love the Lord you love him Lord is so wonderful amen we are not to be dilatory we're not to be complacent amen we got a Ministry we've got a work to do you say well I've been in the message that's all there just is well if you're not being active in this message something wrong God didn't just call you to be this message so you can be all saved and glorified and saved and you know all these things what about others that are needing help you think denominations got that power to do that absolutely not [Music] it's true I believe that God is still using people today his elect his agency his church to bring souls in and I just believe that you love him I am redeemed I've been bought with a price Jesus my whole life oh if anybody asked me just who I am just tell them I am redeemed aren't you glad you redeemed oh god oh I am reading I've been
