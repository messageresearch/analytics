[34:43] and sister Mariah with us tonight praise
[34:47] the Lord and um that brother Bob with us
[34:50] and as well amen and U amen um the
[34:55] musicians can be dismissed
[34:57] but uh if you have your Bibles we're
[34:59] just going to go right into the word
[35:03] um Hebrews the 2nd
[35:07] chapter
[35:11] amen the Lord is so good to us
[35:15] amen
[35:25] amen Hebrews two and uh we'll start at
[35:28] the 14th
[35:31] verse for as much then as the children
[35:35] are partakers of Flesh and
[35:37] Blood he also himself likewise took part
[35:41] of the
[35:43] same that through death he might destroy
[35:47] him that had the power o of death that
[35:51] is the
[35:52] devil and deliver them who through fear
[35:56] of death
[35:57] were all their lifetime subject to
[36:00] bondage for verily he took not on
[36:03] himself the nature of angels but took on
[36:06] him the Seed of
[36:08] Abraham wherefore in all things it
[36:11] behooved him to be made like unto his
[36:15] Brethren that he might be a
[36:18] merciful and faithful high priest in
[36:20] things pertaining to God to make
[36:24] reconciliation for the sins of the
[36:27] people for in that he himself hath
[36:32] suffered being tempted he is able to
[36:35] secur them that are
[36:38] tempted amen then if you'd like to uh uh
[36:42] go uh Hebrews the 4th
[36:49] chapter
[36:52] and Hebrews 4 and 14 we'll start there
[36:58] seeing then that we have a great high
[37:01] priest that has passed into the heavens
[37:04] Jesus the son of God let us hold fast
[37:06] our
[37:07] profession for we have not a high priest
[37:10] which cannot be touched with the feeling
[37:13] of our infirmities but in was in all
[37:15] points tempted like as we are yet
[37:18] without
[37:19] sin Let Us therefore come boldly unto
[37:22] the throne of grace that we may obtain
[37:24] mercy and find Grace to help in time of
[37:28] need amen let's just bow our heads and
[37:32] talk to our Lord
[37:34] father the scriptures that we have read
[37:37] is so profound Lord and it just causes
[37:43] us to to rest in you Lord and we pray
[37:49] father that you would just make it more
[37:52] real make it more clear to us father
[37:56] just let it anchor into our
[37:58] soul I pray father that you would anoint
[38:01] both speaker and hearer tonight bless
[38:03] what simple words we would have father
[38:07] pray that your blood would just cover us
[38:09] now father if there be any sick among us
[38:13] any
[38:14] discouraged Lord or whatever the need
[38:16] would be may you just touch them we ask
[38:20] it in Jesus Christ's name
[38:23] amen amen you can have your seat this
[38:28] evening I want
[38:30] to continue along the thought of our
[38:34] great high
[38:36] priest and
[38:39] um of course in the Old Testament
[38:45] uh as as we know God had
[38:48] established a uh a
[38:51] priesthood and and Paul talks about it
[38:55] um as well as
[38:57] uh Leviticus and uh different places but
[39:01] uh he established this this priesthood
[39:04] and had uh appointed Aaron uh to be uh
[39:09] the high priest and as we said uh last
[39:14] week Aaron uh his name uh means very
[39:18] high and he stood Supreme one writer
[39:22] said he stood Supreme as the high priest
[39:25] uh very high above his own house as well
[39:27] as exalted above the people and Aaron
[39:31] was a a descendant of Levi and um the
[39:36] Bible you know calls it the uh the the
[39:39] levitical priesthood or we would know it
[39:43] as the uh ironic I guess this ironic uh
[39:48] priesthood and um and and this is
[39:51] because it would come from a lineage of
[39:54] of priests out of out of the lineage
[39:56] Lage of Levi no man could be a a priest
[40:00] or a high priest um uh outside that
[40:04] lineage and so um brother brandham
[40:07] talked about how that uh those men in in
[40:13] that lineage they they weren't uh
[40:16] ordinary like you and I are uh in the
[40:20] sense that they had to come out of the
[40:22] lineage of Levi to be a priest and every
[40:25] priest had to be born uh from this
[40:28] lineage of this holy man and um they had
[40:33] to be perfectly good priests uh brother
[40:36] brah said not even uh uh said one one
[40:39] little jot or anything wrong that stoned
[40:41] them to death uh they had to walk the
[40:44] line they had to be Orthodox Gun Barrel
[40:47] straight they had to be real men they
[40:49] had to know that law and and so as we we
[40:53] look at it but yet as as as uh strict as
[40:58] they were and as as um God required of
[41:02] them yet it was just a priesthood of of
[41:05] men and so Paul there in in Hebrews 7
[41:10] and 23 it says and there they truly were
[41:14] many priests uh because uh they were not
[41:17] suffered to continue by reason of death
[41:21] so so we we see that that uh uh when
[41:25] when one priest died another priest took
[41:27] its place and then and it was just
[41:30] carrying on one priest after another
[41:32] after another and and and things and but
[41:36] also they they had to not all only offer
[41:39] blood for the people but they had to
[41:42] offer blood for themselves and then this
[41:45] this levitical priesthood uh the only
[41:49] blood that they had to offer was animal
[41:51] blood uh uh to God and and of course we
[41:55] know that that blood
[41:57] uh was not uh sufficient and so so
[42:01] through through all of this this
[42:02] priesthood had to to come to an end it
[42:06] it had uh uh to be abolished it was only
[42:09] temporary and this is what Paul when
[42:12] he's dealing with the Jews they couldn't
[42:15] understand that how could God ordain
[42:19] something and and set in order and and
[42:22] then all of a sudden abolish it but uh
[42:26] you know the the the prophet says that
[42:28] that even God would show through Moses
[42:32] that that this this levitical priesthood
[42:35] would come to its end he said because
[42:38] when God gave Moses the law was given to
[42:41] Moses there at the Ten Commandments and
[42:44] he had this this this Stone uh uh in his
[42:48] hands and he says the weakness of Moses
[42:51] Moses had a weakness and that was his
[42:53] temper and uh and because of that uh he
[42:57] he threw them stone that rock on the
[43:00] ground and it just it broke and uh it it
[43:04] it shattered and so brother brandham
[43:06] said it showed right then that the
[43:08] levitical priesthood would be broken but
[43:11] see it could be broken it it could be
[43:14] broken because the that that levitical
[43:17] priesthood was not uh uh uh established
[43:22] based up on an oath amen it was not
[43:26] established on an oath and so because
[43:29] when God establishes something with an
[43:32] oath then it cannot be destroyed but but
[43:35] there in Hebrews the the 7eventh chapter
[43:38] and we'll get into it in in a minute but
[43:40] uh uh Paul would tell us that that the
[43:43] levitical priesthood was not established
[43:46] this line of priest and the lineage of
[43:48] of Levi it was not established by an
[43:52] oath even though God uh uh put him uh
[43:55] put him
[43:56] there and and and started this this
[43:59] priesthood but it was only to show of
[44:01] another priesthood to come and so uh uh
[44:05] but but this is why I think this is what
[44:07] makes us different even as the people of
[44:10] God uh from from just the church world
[44:14] the Church of the Living God has been
[44:17] established by an oath that God has
[44:20] given amen there's all kinds of churches
[44:23] and Brides brides and as the prophet
[44:26] says and all that but there's only been
[44:27] one that has been established by an oath
[44:31] and this is why the Church of God will
[44:34] never fail and and it keeps on enduring
[44:37] being fed to the Lions and burnt at the
[44:39] Stak and and and all kinds of things but
[44:43] it it it still stands and so if you
[44:47] notice that God um uh uh uh he he
[44:52] thought it necessary to to secure the
[44:57] the the the faith of his elect Amen in
[45:00] something that would be solid and he he
[45:04] never intended for for our faith uh to
[45:08] rest in in a bunch of men and and he
[45:11] never intended for our our faith to to
[45:15] rest in man period it it doesn't matter
[45:18] what it was it it don't matter the gift
[45:20] it don't matter the the position it it
[45:23] it doesn't matter anything amen our
[45:26] faith is not to rest amen upon Humanity
[45:30] ain't that right and so therefore the
[45:33] the this priesthood of men uh had to be
[45:36] abolished and when it was then God
[45:40] established a a another uh priesthood uh
[45:44] um uh which was far superior to to the
[45:47] old ain't that right and so we we're
[45:50] looking and we have a great high priest
[45:53] and and and and that has been
[45:56] established not by through the lineage
[45:59] of of Levi amen but but uh of another
[46:03] order amen a a high priest that is is
[46:07] here to do a a far greater work than
[46:11] than what the the uh uh priesthood of
[46:14] men uh uh could ever do and so uh
[46:18] Hebrews 71 Paul would say if therefore
[46:22] Perfection were by the levitical
[46:24] priesthood for under it the people
[46:27] received the law what further need was
[46:30] there that another priest should rise
[46:33] after the order of MDC and not be called
[46:36] after the order of Aaron amen and so uh
[46:40] uh uh what what God is doing is he's
[46:42] meeting a need amen and and that need
[46:47] comes from his own word amen God is is
[46:52] is meeting something that would would
[46:55] Supply
[46:56] amen for his own word you see God uh uh
[47:00] we as we know spoke his word before the
[47:03] foundation of the world and and and when
[47:06] he spoke it then there there is a need
[47:09] that arises because God's word will
[47:12] never fail do you believe that God's
[47:14] word will never fail and so God has to
[47:17] supply that need in order to fulfill his
[47:21] word amen uh Jesus said Heaven and Earth
[47:24] shall pass away but my word shall never
[47:27] pass away ain't that right so so we know
[47:30] these scriptures but they are profound
[47:33] to us and and and we must hold them dear
[47:36] but uh uh Ephesians 41 and4 according as
[47:40] he hath chosen Us in him before the
[47:43] foundation of the world and and and what
[47:46] is that reason is that we should be holy
[47:49] and Without Blame before him in love
[47:52] having predestinated us unto the
[47:54] adoption of children according to the
[47:56] good pleasure of his will ain't that
[47:59] right so so he he didn't just set you
[48:02] here on Earth but he predestinated you
[48:05] amen uh to something and and that we
[48:08] would be uh uh holy and Without Blame
[48:11] before him in love uh Romans 8:29 for
[48:15] whom he did Forno he also did
[48:17] predestinate to be conformed to the
[48:18] image of his son that he might be the
[48:20] firstborn among many Brethren moreover
[48:23] notice moreover whom he did past tense
[48:27] predestinate them he also called and
[48:30] them whom he called he also past tense
[48:33] Justified so he's already put you uh in
[48:37] in in a in a position amen he has
[48:40] already declared you and and and whom he
[48:43] justified he's already pasted in
[48:45] glorified amen see so in in God's mind
[48:49] that is the word concerning you amen
[48:52] Isaiah
[48:53] 54:17 no weapon that is formed against
[48:56] thee is going to prosper amen see every
[48:59] tongue that shall rise against thee in
[49:01] judgment Thou shalt condemn this is the
[49:03] heritage of the Servants of the Lord and
[49:06] the righteousness is of me sayith the
[49:09] Lord so that that is a promise that that
[49:12] is a word that that that has already
[49:15] been spoken do you believe that but but
[49:18] look at it we are a fallen people we are
[49:20] a people that that born with a carnal
[49:23] nature Paul says that we were by Nature
[49:27] the children of Wrath amen our our enemy
[49:30] is our accuser amen and and accusing us
[49:34] before the our very God our very Creator
[49:38] and the Very one that predestinated to
[49:41] to be without blame and and and before
[49:43] him in love the very one that spoke his
[49:46] word to about us he elect Satan is there
[49:51] amen bringing an accusation see so we we
[49:55] we know that God cannot stand to look
[49:58] upon sin he he he's holy and and sin to
[50:02] him uh is is such a a wicked thing and
[50:05] and that's why we we were alienated from
[50:08] him in the beginning and we were
[50:11] afflicted by sickness and diseases
[50:13] because of sin ain't that right amen and
[50:17] and and so we we we look at all these
[50:20] things but but God had already spoke his
[50:23] word concerning us before having done
[50:26] good or evil before we ever told our
[50:29] first lie before we ever amen had our
[50:32] temper uh tantrums and and all that God
[50:35] had already spoke a word concerning you
[50:39] so so as as the prophet says we were
[50:41] born defeated we were born amen going
[50:45] the negative we we were born not even re
[50:48] reflecting anything that God would
[50:50] predestinate us to be a ain't that right
[50:54] that God is determined that his word
[50:56] will never fail he he's determined of
[50:59] that ain't that right see because his
[51:02] word is not just a a a a passing thing
[51:05] it is a promise every promise that God
[51:08] makes or every word that God speaks is
[51:11] is a promise and he is determined to to
[51:14] to keep them so God's word God's word uh
[51:18] overrides every situation it it doesn't
[51:21] matter how
[51:22] impossible uh uh it is it it's going to
[51:26] override it because it comes from God
[51:29] himself ain't that right amen we we look
[51:32] at Psalms
[51:33] 10720 he sent his word and healed them
[51:37] and delivered them from their
[51:39] destructions it was the word of God that
[51:41] done it do you believe that amen I I
[51:44] just believe that when we began to
[51:46] preach about the promises of God that
[51:48] word has first priority over every devil
[51:52] in hell and God will sin preachers amen
[51:55] man to preach the healing power of God
[51:57] he sends his word and his word comes and
[52:01] and delivers and heals and and and
[52:03] things like that so God see God loves it
[52:07] when the situation gets worse and worse
[52:10] he he loves it when our our our back is
[52:13] against the wall and and and we just
[52:16] don't know what to do he because it it
[52:19] it magnifies him amen he he's the one
[52:23] that allows us to hit the bottom he's
[52:25] the one that allows us Amen to to to
[52:29] where it seems like we're going to go
[52:31] under amen you see but but as as the
[52:35] prophet had had uh uh talked about and
[52:37] we all know it about the law of God
[52:39] which is the law of contrast amen there
[52:43] there's that law of contrast our
[52:45] weakness contrast his strength our our
[52:48] uh inabilities contrasts his abilities
[52:51] our our failures contrast is a cont
[52:55] contr to his faithfulness ain't that
[52:57] right amen the the the the the the
[53:00] situations that we are limited to amen
[53:03] of of of being able to help it's our
[53:06] limitations are only a contrast to his
[53:10] his unlimited power and Supreme Being
[53:14] amen you see so so God God doesn't God's
[53:18] not worried about his word he's not
[53:20] worried about whether his word is going
[53:23] to be able to to be fulfilled he's not
[53:25] worried about amen being able to keep
[53:27] his word amen you see it was uh even in
[53:31] in in Genesis there he asks Abraham
[53:34] Genesis
[53:35] 18:14 God would say to him is there
[53:38] anything too hard for the Lord amen it
[53:41] was Abraham that that was was wandering
[53:45] it was Abraham that that uh you know
[53:48] didn't understand everything amen but
[53:51] God had already gave him his word amen
[53:54] so so it wasn't you know Abraham I I I
[53:57] don't know what I'm going to do you know
[53:59] I'm kind of sitting here on the rock
[54:00] with you you know and don't know what to
[54:02] do you know but but it wasn't that at
[54:04] all God would ask him is there anything
[54:07] too hard for the Lord that that's what
[54:09] God wants I I believe he ask us you know
[54:12] uh uh uh in our situations that that
[54:15] question still stands is there anything
[54:17] too hard for the Lord amen and and and
[54:20] you can you you you can give the the
[54:22] worst scenario uh uh uh in your
[54:25] situation and yet the question would
[54:27] ring out is there anything too hard for
[54:30] the Lord amen you see um the the
[54:34] question that that God would ask Abraham
[54:37] amen is is in reference to the promise
[54:40] that God made to Abraham you see God
[54:43] told Abraham that he would have a son
[54:46] and that that he would call this son uh
[54:49] Isaac and and and and so God had already
[54:52] said his word it was going to happen
[54:54] amen but the the thing is is Abraham
[54:58] could not have children amen uh uh it
[55:02] was it was a problem for Abraham but yet
[55:05] God had already declared that he would
[55:08] have a son amen and he also said that
[55:11] Isaac would come through the womb of
[55:13] Sarah and and yet she couldn't have
[55:16] children she was Barren ain't that right
[55:19] and so God would tell Abraham that it
[55:22] would it would be through Isaac that
[55:24] that Abraham would become the father of
[55:27] Nations it would be through Isaac amen
[55:30] the Abraham seed would possess the Gate
[55:33] of his enemies ain't that right and yet
[55:35] Abraham couldn't do nothing about it
[55:37] because he couldn't have children and
[55:39] and so he had nothing to bring to the
[55:41] table and say God this is a good idea
[55:44] you know I've already had 20 of them so
[55:45] let's let's have another one and we'll
[55:47] just call him Isaac and we'll just move
[55:49] on with your plan well I Abraham could
[55:53] not do that he had not nothing to give
[55:55] he had nothing to offer amen you see so
[55:58] God didn't make this promise to well
[56:01] capable well aable people amen see but
[56:05] he would make it to a individuals that
[56:08] was totally impossible for This Promise
[56:12] Amen to come to pass without the help of
[56:15] the Lord amen and then he gives this
[56:18] promise when Abraham is 75 and Sarah is
[56:22] 65 on top of that he he you know he he
[56:25] could have you know just gave it to them
[56:26] when they were you know in their 20s and
[56:29] and things but God wanted this situation
[56:31] to become more impossible amen and more
[56:35] impossible because no matter how how
[56:37] impossible the situation gets God is
[56:40] still on the throne it never changes
[56:44] God's word can you say amen amen see so
[56:48] he gives the promise to Abraham at 75
[56:50] Sarah 65 and then on top of that he
[56:54] waits 25 five more years amen uh uh uh
[56:58] allowing them to get older ain't that
[57:00] right becoming a more impossible
[57:04] situation and so we know that they
[57:06] weren't able to have children in the
[57:07] first place see but but see God knew
[57:11] when he gave the promise he knew it
[57:13] would take himself to fulfill it and
[57:17] that's what he wanted he wanted to be
[57:19] the one he wanted to be the the the god
[57:22] of of uh he's the only one that can
[57:25] secure his promise do you believe that
[57:28] amen see so so we we look and and the
[57:31] Covenant that God had even made to
[57:33] Abraham wasn't an unconditional Covenant
[57:36] which means that that Abraham had
[57:38] nothing to do with it the prophet says
[57:41] you know it when God made it he said
[57:43] Abraham it's not if you do this then
[57:45] I'll do this and if you'll do that I'll
[57:47] do this it was Abraham I've already done
[57:49] it amen so so Abraham had nothing to do
[57:53] with it except he was the
[57:56] beneficiary of of the promise that God
[57:58] by Grace Sovereign Grace just gave to
[58:02] Abraham Abraham didn't deserve it
[58:05] Abraham wasn't worthy of it there was
[58:07] nothing that Abraham could have done to
[58:09] gain uh uh this this favor from God it
[58:13] was Grace Grace Grace can you say amen
[58:17] amen see and so the this Covenant that
[58:20] God made with Abraham it didn't rest in
[58:24] upon the capability of Abraham God would
[58:28] fulfill his own word when he gives the
[58:31] promise that you're going to have a son
[58:33] God would fulfill his own word do you
[58:37] believe that you see it's the
[58:39] unconditional Covenant that that brings
[58:42] out the attributes of God and magnifies
[58:46] him in such a way it magnified his Mercy
[58:49] it it magnified his faithfulness it
[58:52] magnified his transform forming power it
[58:56] it it magnified the the longsuffering of
[58:59] God Amen that God would wait and wait
[59:02] and wait and wait but at the right time
[59:06] amen see God doesn't have to give the
[59:08] promise and then immediately fulfill
[59:10] that promise he can wait as long as he
[59:13] wants to Amen to think of it he already
[59:16] called you into Perfection he already
[59:19] glorified you before time even started
[59:23] and here we are the world has been 6,000
[59:26] years now and yet got that promise Still
[59:30] Remains true can you say Amen because it
[59:33] doesn't matter to God Amen you can be up
[59:36] today and down tomorrow you can have the
[59:38] money in the bank today and and be
[59:40] totally broke tomorrow but it does not
[59:42] matter to God Amen for God keeps his own
[59:47] word see it was a Covenant of Grace So
[59:50] then Abraham's weakness was not in the
[59:54] faith of of Abraham for his faith was
[59:57] not weak amen but it was in his ability
[1:00:00] to make the promise of God come to pass
[1:00:04] and I want to say it tonight that no
[1:00:05] matter how weak you are amen and how
[1:00:08] impossible you are the weakness does not
[1:00:11] lay in your faith amen the weakness lays
[1:00:14] in your ability to make it happen but
[1:00:17] don't you worry the God of all ability
[1:00:21] the god that is supreme is the one that
[1:00:23] made the promise Pro so Abraham all he
[1:00:27] could do was just rest in God's promise
[1:00:30] he couldn't hurry it up we all know that
[1:00:32] Sarah tried to make it happen amen
[1:00:35] through another way and and and it it it
[1:00:38] it just messed it up but it never
[1:00:39] detoured God from his word do you
[1:00:42] believe that amen we even look at at
[1:00:45] even even when Abraham went down into to
[1:00:49] egyp or wherever that was and and out
[1:00:52] out of the Homeland and he lied Amen to
[1:00:55] to aimc amen but yet God would never let
[1:01:00] that word amen uh be his word be
[1:01:03] detoured ain't that right amen see God
[1:01:06] Amen and and I like what the prophet
[1:01:08] said I was just I wish I had the quote
[1:01:10] before me but he said that just shows
[1:01:12] that that that you have not gone so far
[1:01:15] amen you see if you are a promised Son
[1:01:18] of God if you are a daughter of Promise
[1:01:21] amen it does not matter sin does not
[1:01:24] matter failure does not matter mistakes
[1:01:27] does not matter the prophet said just
[1:01:29] repent amen see there's a God there that
[1:01:32] is going to keep his word concerning his
[1:01:35] elect amen and so God it Abraham lied
[1:01:38] but God still kept his word amen Sarah
[1:01:41] doubted God but God still kept his word
[1:01:44] amen for his word was
[1:01:47] unconditional do you believe that amen
[1:01:50] it was unconditional so so we remember
[1:01:53] how that God made made a conditional
[1:01:55] Covenant with Adam that if you do this
[1:01:58] then I'll do this if you do this I'll do
[1:02:00] this and and yada yada you know and and
[1:02:03] we find that that Covenant it did not
[1:02:06] magnify God's strength it did not it
[1:02:08] only magnified Adam's weakness it it
[1:02:12] magnified amen the fact that he could
[1:02:15] not keep the end of his bargain ain't
[1:02:17] that right amen but we find out through
[1:02:20] Grace that it's through our weakness
[1:02:22] that God's strength is made perfect amen
[1:02:25] you see that's what God wants us to do
[1:02:27] he does not want our abilities and and
[1:02:30] and he doesn't want what we have to
[1:02:32] offer all he wants is us to trust him
[1:02:36] amen and the thing is is is we never had
[1:02:39] a a and we never had a choice in what we
[1:02:42] wanted to do we we it was God that chose
[1:02:45] us before we breathed our first breath
[1:02:48] do you believe that amen see and so then
[1:02:51] we we we can anchor our our our whole
[1:02:55] soul our faith our our joy Our Hope in
[1:02:59] the fact that God keeps his word
[1:03:01] concerning us amen the promises of God
[1:03:04] being fulfilled does not hinge on
[1:03:06] whether I can or cannot you see God
[1:03:09] never meant for us to obtain the
[1:03:11] promises on our own amen he doesn't mean
[1:03:14] you know when we preach the promises and
[1:03:16] you look at him you think I'm so far
[1:03:18] away from them things it it never God
[1:03:21] never meant to put you in panic mode
[1:03:24] never meant to put you in a I got to
[1:03:26] hurry I got to do this I got to do that
[1:03:28] no no no amen God is going to fulfill
[1:03:32] his word concerning his promises is
[1:03:35] elect and so even though uh uh uh you
[1:03:39] know that Abraham couldn't do it Sarah
[1:03:42] couldn't do it God knew it and and and
[1:03:44] at the time that when MDC appeared to to
[1:03:48] to Abraham there in Genesis 18 and10 He
[1:03:52] said I will ser certainly everybody say
[1:03:56] certainly I will certainly return unto
[1:03:59] thee according to the time of life and
[1:04:02] lo Sarah thy wife shall have a son you
[1:04:06] see God had to do something God had to
[1:04:09] meet the need in order for the promise
[1:04:12] to be fulfilled amen see in order for
[1:04:15] God to keep his word the prophet said he
[1:04:18] had to do something to Sarah's womb amen
[1:04:20] he had to give her a completely new womb
[1:04:24] because hers was old and gone he had to
[1:04:28] strengthen her heart amen see in order
[1:04:31] for her to to to give birth Amen to a
[1:04:34] child he had to give her new milk veins
[1:04:37] because uh uh they were dried up see and
[1:04:40] then look at Abraham his body was
[1:04:43] already dead amen uh concerning uh you
[1:04:46] know his manhood and things like that
[1:04:49] but through the power of
[1:04:52] transformation God was able to show his
[1:04:56] power and change them back to their
[1:04:59] youth again amen he changed their body
[1:05:03] and he turned them back to youth ain't
[1:05:05] that right see so then they had the
[1:05:09] child just as God had promised God kept
[1:05:13] his word because he was able to supply
[1:05:17] the need amen you see there's nothing
[1:05:20] too late for God I don't care how wward
[1:05:22] your child is there's nothing too late
[1:05:24] for God Amen I I don't care what the
[1:05:27] situation is there's nothing too late
[1:05:28] for God even the prophet says that if
[1:05:31] you had that you know if there's that
[1:05:32] perfect faith and doctor told you Friday
[1:05:34] that you're going to die Monday you
[1:05:36] would just look at him laugh in his face
[1:05:38] and say well amen glory to God you know
[1:05:40] why because nothing is too late for God
[1:05:43] we have seen this through the ministry
[1:05:45] of brother Brandon that it didn't matter
[1:05:47] if they were Skin and Bones and just
[1:05:49] laying there just a a a skin over bone
[1:05:52] amen yet the power of God would come
[1:05:55] into that woman amen and raise her up
[1:05:57] from the deathbed amen and many many
[1:06:00] times that we have seen God not only
[1:06:02] through the ministry of brother Brandon
[1:06:04] but even in our own lives we have seen
[1:06:06] God do it time and time and time again
[1:06:10] when our back was against the wall it
[1:06:12] looked like everything was going to cave
[1:06:14] in God stood there in time and brought
[1:06:17] us through how else do you think you
[1:06:19] made it this far it was God that done
[1:06:22] that can you sayen God keeps his word so
[1:06:26] nothing is ever too late for God see so
[1:06:30] the the the the weakness of Abraham and
[1:06:33] Sarah only perfected his ability amen
[1:06:37] see and so uh uh uh the prophet said God
[1:06:40] done that to Sarah and Abraham to show
[1:06:43] what he would do for us in this last day
[1:06:46] so you go think of that it's been years
[1:06:48] and thousands of years since Abraham and
[1:06:51] Sarah but as he was given them that
[1:06:54] promise as he was taking care of them
[1:06:56] amen he was also looking at what he was
[1:06:59] going to do for us in this day and he's
[1:07:02] here in the same mezc as he appeared to
[1:07:05] Abraham and Sarah amen then we find that
[1:07:09] when Isaac reached a certain age that
[1:07:11] God commanded Abraham to to go uh offer
[1:07:15] him up as a sacrifice amen and and
[1:07:19] Abraham being strong in faith uh done
[1:07:22] exactly as he was told amen and and uh
[1:07:26] uh uh you know Isaac looked and said dad
[1:07:30] you know I see the wood I see the I see
[1:07:32] everything for a sacrifice I problem is
[1:07:35] I don't see the sacrifice where's that
[1:07:37] at and and Abraham just said well son
[1:07:40] God will provide himself a lamb God will
[1:07:42] provide ain't that right and and we we
[1:07:45] know the story but Abraham uh he he he
[1:07:48] was so persuaded that God would keep his
[1:07:50] word amen that he he put Isaac bounding
[1:07:54] put him up on that Altar and he drew his
[1:07:56] knife and he was getting ready to uh
[1:07:58] plunge that knife through his heart and
[1:08:00] the angel of the Lord was stayed his
[1:08:01] hand amen and there was a a ram amen
[1:08:05] stuck in in the bush ain't that right
[1:08:07] see God showed up just in the right time
[1:08:13] amen that's right see and he showed
[1:08:16] himself as as Jehovah Gyra amen but why
[1:08:20] would God take time Amen to to to uh uh
[1:08:24] uh provide a ram because there was a
[1:08:26] need amen see God God had a need now you
[1:08:30] want to just look at God had a need
[1:08:33] because it's his word amen Isaac was the
[1:08:36] promised son amen and Abraham was
[1:08:39] getting ready to take that son out of
[1:08:40] existence so to speak and God had to
[1:08:43] keep his word so he provided
[1:08:47] himself amen he provided himself a
[1:08:50] sacrifice ain't that right see because
[1:08:53] the promise was in Isaac and so is it
[1:08:56] amen that the promise lays within us for
[1:08:59] we are God's promised children do you
[1:09:03] believe that amen see so God provided
[1:09:06] amen a sacrifice he provided himself a
[1:09:09] sacrifice for for his word's sake amen
[1:09:13] and then the prophet says now where did
[1:09:14] that Ram come from where where did it
[1:09:17] come from he says Abraham was a 100
[1:09:18] miles or so away from civilization he
[1:09:21] was out you know on a mountain there was
[1:09:23] no water there was no streams there was
[1:09:25] no food amen for that Ram to eat and
[1:09:28] then then the Lions and the coyotes or
[1:09:30] whatever that was out there would have
[1:09:32] deved that that RAM and and all of these
[1:09:34] things amen but but he says the ram
[1:09:37] appeared on the scene in a crucial
[1:09:40] moment see it it appeared there and and
[1:09:43] and he says God created that Ram amen
[1:09:46] God spoke that Ram into existence see
[1:09:50] once again amen he he would have Abraham
[1:09:53] to go to where there was a totally
[1:09:56] impossible Amen to come up with some
[1:09:58] sacrifice amen Abraham had to stand
[1:10:01] totally holy upon what God told him to
[1:10:04] do amen and to honor what God and to
[1:10:07] believe God and to have faith in God and
[1:10:10] it was up to God to take care of it can
[1:10:12] you say amen and God did take care of it
[1:10:16] amen by providing his own speaking it
[1:10:19] into existence aren't you glad for that
[1:10:22] amen God keeps his word amen Psalms uh
[1:10:26] 46 And1 God is our refuge and strength a
[1:10:29] very present help in trouble amen
[1:10:32] therefore we will not fear amen though
[1:10:36] the Earth be removed and though the
[1:10:38] mountains be carried into the midst of
[1:10:40] the sea though the waters thereof Roar
[1:10:43] and be troubled though the mountains
[1:10:45] shake with the swelling thereof Sal
[1:10:48] there is a river the streams whereof
[1:10:50] shall make glad the city of God the holy
[1:10:53] place of the Tabernacles of the most
[1:10:55] high God is in the midst of her she
[1:10:59] shall not be moved can you say that with
[1:11:02] me I shall not be moved I shall not be
[1:11:05] moved why because because I voted a
[1:11:08] Republican or Democrat because my my
[1:11:11] money got money in the bank I got to
[1:11:12] find job I got to find house I got to
[1:11:14] find wife got to find children is that
[1:11:17] why I'm not going to be moved no God is
[1:11:19] in the midst of her a ain't that right
[1:11:22] see she shall not be moved God shall
[1:11:24] help her and that right early so to
[1:11:28] think of it because God chose us before
[1:11:31] the foundation of the world that we
[1:11:33] should be holy Without Blame before him
[1:11:34] and love because he fornew us and he
[1:11:37] called us and he predestinated us and he
[1:11:40] glorified us because he predestinated us
[1:11:43] to be conformed to the image of his own
[1:11:46] son then God himself had to find a way
[1:11:51] to secure us amen the promise lays
[1:11:54] within us can you say Amen you think of
[1:11:57] what he's done with this word and how he
[1:11:59] has protected this word amen to where
[1:12:02] they have burned it they have they have
[1:12:04] outlawed it they have done all kinds of
[1:12:06] stuff with this word but this word still
[1:12:09] exists now if he would do that for a
[1:12:11] Bible that is only printed amen and and
[1:12:14] and it gets falls apart and all these
[1:12:16] things how much more the word concerning
[1:12:19] you that he put within you can you say
[1:12:22] man he's going to protect that word he's
[1:12:25] going to protect that seed ain't that
[1:12:27] right amen see so so he he security
[1:12:31] though it's it's not going to be a
[1:12:33] temporal security amen but to provide an
[1:12:36] eternal security amen Paul would call it
[1:12:40] Eternal Redemption another thing Matthew
[1:12:43] 5:48 we have read it before but Jesus
[1:12:46] said be ye therefore perfect even as
[1:12:48] your father which is in heaven is
[1:12:51] perfect see so he it it was all already
[1:12:53] there it was his decree it was his will
[1:12:56] it was his desire so he had to find a
[1:13:00] way to make us perfect there's no way
[1:13:04] that none of us could be perfect and
[1:13:06] you're not to strive to be perfect in
[1:13:08] that sense amen God would make a way to
[1:13:12] bring this
[1:13:14] Perfection eternal
[1:13:17] security Eternal Redemption Eternal
[1:13:20] Perfection it does not start when we get
[1:13:23] on the other side into heaven when the
[1:13:26] devil's destroyed and all these things
[1:13:30] if if that is the case then we would
[1:13:32] have no place to rest our faith in uh uh
[1:13:36] if you know if if our security only
[1:13:40] started when we got to the other side
[1:13:43] and and and there's all the sickness and
[1:13:45] the sins and the corruption is destroyed
[1:13:48] then our Salvation our healing
[1:13:52] everything even in heaven it would just
[1:13:54] be left up to chance amen you know we we
[1:13:59] could you imagine and there's so many
[1:14:00] people that that live that way today
[1:14:02] that they they're doing everything that
[1:14:04] they can to make it but they have no
[1:14:06] security that they're going to make it
[1:14:09] wouldn't that be awful you you cannot
[1:14:11] have faith with that type of of belief
[1:14:16] how you going to do it then then your
[1:14:18] faith only goes into yourself if I'm
[1:14:21] good today then maybe you know I'm
[1:14:22] getting a little closer to heaven now
[1:14:24] you know but what about tomorrow when
[1:14:26] you fail what about you you living a a
[1:14:28] good for a year and then you you you you
[1:14:31] you you know you make that blunder you
[1:14:33] know a year from now and and then you
[1:14:36] you got to start back all over you
[1:14:38] understand what I'm saying it it's it's
[1:14:40] such a it keeps a person Topsy Turvy but
[1:14:43] see our going to heaven is not
[1:14:46] coincidental I the the changing of our
[1:14:49] body is not left to chance amen we've
[1:14:52] read this scripture many times um
[1:14:54] Jeremiah 29:11 for I know the thoughts
[1:14:57] that I think toward you sayith the Lord
[1:14:59] thoughts of peace and not of evil to
[1:15:02] give you an expected End Amen give you
[1:15:05] an expected end do you realize that it's
[1:15:07] his expectation for you to reach that
[1:15:10] end it was his expectation he's the one
[1:15:14] that that that put you amen and
[1:15:16] determined your end and he's under
[1:15:19] expectation now he's the one that's got
[1:15:21] to meet the need right can you say amen
[1:15:24] amen amen Psalms 37:23 the steps of a
[1:15:28] good man the righteous man are ordered
[1:15:30] of the Lord so there there's there's not
[1:15:32] it's this Christian life is not a chance
[1:15:35] amen it's it's you're you're not doing
[1:15:37] this by chance you ain't getting healed
[1:15:38] by chance you're not getting saved by
[1:15:40] chance you didn't come into this message
[1:15:42] by chance you ain't making it to Heaven
[1:15:44] by chance you n none of these things are
[1:15:46] by chance every promise of God is
[1:15:50] eternally secured to us do you believe
[1:15:54] that and we are eternally secured to
[1:15:58] them for Paul would even say I am
[1:16:00] persuaded that there's nothing amen
[1:16:03] that'll ever separate me from the love
[1:16:05] of God there's nothing that'll separate
[1:16:07] me from the promises of God Amen
[1:16:10] whatever God has given me as a promise
[1:16:12] they are mine by right and they are
[1:16:15] legally mine ain't that right I am
[1:16:18] eternally secure to them so see God had
[1:16:22] to provide something that would secure
[1:16:24] his promise that laid within us amen see
[1:16:28] and and you know uh God doesn't have to
[1:16:32] do anything but when he speaks his word
[1:16:35] then he is Duty bound to honor that word
[1:16:38] Lord amen he didn't have to choose us
[1:16:40] but he did it ain't that right so then
[1:16:43] he's Duty bound Amen to to to make that
[1:16:46] word come to pass oh if we could rest in
[1:16:49] that promised word tonight amen rest in
[1:16:53] who we are now Paul would tell us in in
[1:16:56] Hebrews 7: 19 the law made nothing
[1:17:00] perfect amen it it did not accomplish
[1:17:03] God's will in in what he predestinated
[1:17:06] us to be ain't that right but the
[1:17:08] bringing in of a better hope Christ did
[1:17:13] amen by the which we draw nigh unto God
[1:17:16] by the which we are changed from carnal
[1:17:18] to spiritual by the witch amen we we we
[1:17:22] we the World loses its hold on us and we
[1:17:25] are changed from glory to glory can you
[1:17:28] say amen amen why God provided something
[1:17:31] that the law could not
[1:17:34] do you see the law could not provide
[1:17:37] eternal security Eternal Redemption
[1:17:41] Perfection Eternal fellowship and
[1:17:43] Oneness with God it cannot do that you
[1:17:47] know and and and it did not have the
[1:17:49] strength enough to fulfill God's word in
[1:17:52] US
[1:17:53] in man it it just didn't do it it didn't
[1:17:55] have the strength to justify us it did
[1:17:57] not have the strength Amen to to uh uh
[1:18:02] uh call us out it did not have the
[1:18:04] strength to glorify us it it didn't have
[1:18:06] the strength to bring us to that
[1:18:08] expected end that God had for us amen
[1:18:11] the law could not do that ain't that
[1:18:13] right amen you see because the law was
[1:18:15] based on condition of what you did and
[1:18:18] what you you didn't do and and these
[1:18:20] things and and this is why God did not
[1:18:23] amen choose Abraham by law amen it was
[1:18:27] Grace that chose Abraham and he did not
[1:18:30] give the promise to Abraham by law under
[1:18:33] law ain't that right for Abraham and
[1:18:35] Sarah could not produce Isaac after the
[1:18:38] law he it just couldn't happen because
[1:18:41] they had not the ability to do it and
[1:18:44] the church cannot produce any promise of
[1:18:47] God under a law can you say amen that's
[1:18:51] right see amen so the Propet says you
[1:18:53] you can't no matter what you do you quit
[1:18:55] drinking quit smoking quit telling lies
[1:18:57] go to church try to do this and try to
[1:18:59] do that you're still carnal see that's
[1:19:01] just law the law makes nothing perfect
[1:19:03] but what makes perfect Christ see I
[1:19:05] might quit lying quit stealing
[1:19:07] committing adultery chewing quit all
[1:19:09] these things but I'm still carnal see
[1:19:11] God doesn't receive that because I have
[1:19:13] nothing to offer him in
[1:19:16] propitiation that's where the need was
[1:19:19] we needed something Amen to propitiate
[1:19:22] for us
[1:19:23] can you say Amen see through all of our
[1:19:25] goodness and all of our goodness and all
[1:19:27] of our goodness we're still carnal amen
[1:19:30] no matter how good you are and how
[1:19:31] perfect you are in in in your abilities
[1:19:34] and all these things you're still carnal
[1:19:36] ain't that right but here Romans 8 and3
[1:19:39] three but for what the law could not do
[1:19:42] in that it was weak through the flesh
[1:19:44] amen because it was trying to perfect
[1:19:46] the flesh it couldn't perfect the soul
[1:19:48] it could not perfect God's word toward
[1:19:49] us God sending his own son in in the
[1:19:53] likeness of sinful flesh and for sin or
[1:19:56] yeah for sin condemn sin in the flesh
[1:19:59] that the righteousness of the law might
[1:20:03] be fulfilled in us who walk not after
[1:20:07] the flesh but after the spirit aren't
[1:20:08] you glad for that now notice uh Hebrews
[1:20:12] 10 and 11 every priest standeth daily
[1:20:15] ministering and offering sometimes the
[1:20:18] same sacrifices which can never take
[1:20:21] away sins but this man this man this
[1:20:25] great high priest after he had offered
[1:20:28] one sacrifice for sins and we know what
[1:20:31] that sacrifice was it was himself amen
[1:20:34] offering up his own
[1:20:37] blood amen am amen forever see one
[1:20:41] sacrifice for sins he offered forever
[1:20:45] see sat down on the right hand of God
[1:20:47] from henceforth expecting till his
[1:20:49] enemies be made his foot stol for by one
[1:20:51] offering everybody say by one offering
[1:20:53] he have perfected forever them that are
[1:20:56] Sanctified God met the needs amen can
[1:21:00] you say Amen this is why when the when
[1:21:02] when tribulation is coming upon us that
[1:21:05] we know the wrath of God is coming amen
[1:21:07] the world knows what's happening the
[1:21:09] world is falling apart but we can rest
[1:21:12] knowing that God met the need he met the
[1:21:16] need amen for by one offering he hath
[1:21:19] perfected forever them that are
[1:21:20] sanctified whereof the Holy Ghost also
[1:21:24] is a witness to us for after that he
[1:21:26] said before this is the Covenant that I
[1:21:29] will make with him after those days
[1:21:31] sayith the Lord I will put my laws in
[1:21:32] their heart and in their minds will I
[1:21:35] write them and their sins and iniquities
[1:21:38] will I remember no more now you think of
[1:21:40] that God remembered his word concerning
[1:21:43] you do you you realize that Prophet said
[1:21:45] that God would take a picture of you
[1:21:47] before you ever were born he took a
[1:21:49] picture of you and that picture is
[1:21:51] always in his mind that picture is
[1:21:53] always before him and that picture does
[1:21:56] not he does not see a scarred individual
[1:21:58] he does not see the scarred Soul he does
[1:22:00] not see the scars in your body he
[1:22:02] doesn't see the torments and the past
[1:22:04] and all of these things there is a
[1:22:06] picture that he took of you and he'll
[1:22:09] never forget that picture he'll never
[1:22:11] forget that word through all the years
[1:22:13] and all the you you say well I haven't
[1:22:15] felt the Lord in so long he never will
[1:22:18] forget that picture he will never forget
[1:22:20] that word oh but you don't understand
[1:22:22] the trials that I'm going through it
[1:22:24] seemed like I'm just about to fall apart
[1:22:25] but God will never forget that word can
[1:22:28] you say Amen but he will forget your
[1:22:31] sins and iniquities because he was able
[1:22:34] to provide a need he was able to meet
[1:22:37] the need that way he get fellowship with
[1:22:39] you not as a sinner not as somebody that
[1:22:42] is so corrupt and a vagabond and worthy
[1:22:44] of death but now he has provided the
[1:22:47] need that he could fellowship with one
[1:22:49] that is righteous as he is because you
[1:22:52] you are now taken upon his righteousness
[1:22:55] therefore you're without sin and you can
[1:22:57] truly say what sin are you talking about
[1:23:01] I don't remember them hallelu think of
[1:23:04] that their sins and iniquities will I
[1:23:07] remember no more all right and now where
[1:23:09] remission of these is there's no more
[1:23:12] offering for sin praise the Lord he
[1:23:15] doesn't need to keep dying for you it's
[1:23:19] done it's done can you say that with me
[1:23:21] it's done
[1:23:23] it's done yes sir you don't need to do
[1:23:25] Penance it's
[1:23:28] done having therefore Brethren boldness
[1:23:31] everybody say boldness now notice this
[1:23:34] is the result of Calvary this is the
[1:23:36] result of the need being met we needed
[1:23:39] someone to perpetuate for us to God God
[1:23:43] would Supply that need by becoming man
[1:23:46] and being not he he became our lamb
[1:23:50] ain't that right became sin for us us
[1:23:53] amen now he becomes our our our high
[1:23:55] priest ain't that right man if if that
[1:23:58] doesn't bring and magnify the love of
[1:24:00] God to us I I don't know what it will
[1:24:03] but because of these things and because
[1:24:05] he's able to demolish the sin we are now
[1:24:08] commanded to go therefore boldly enter
[1:24:13] into the holiest by the blood everybody
[1:24:16] say by the blood by the blood of Jesus
[1:24:19] aren't you glad for that by a New and
[1:24:21] Living Way way which he hath consecrated
[1:24:24] set aside for us through the veil that
[1:24:28] is to say his flesh and having and
[1:24:31] having an high priest over the house of
[1:24:33] God let us because we have a high priest
[1:24:37] because we have someone that is ever
[1:24:39] interceding for us brother Brown said as
[1:24:41] long as there's a need for a high priest
[1:24:43] there will be a high priest can you say
[1:24:45] amen and other words his his office does
[1:24:48] not end and the blood run out and now
[1:24:50] you're left you was saved and now you're
[1:24:53] you're you're here in in the most
[1:24:55] needful time in the most time that you
[1:24:56] need a body change and you're needing
[1:24:58] all that but now the blood's run out and
[1:25:00] they're ain't enough power to to to you
[1:25:02] know and you don't know what you're
[1:25:03] going to do it that that ain't it at all
[1:25:05] can you say amen amen see having an high
[1:25:08] priest over the house of God and we know
[1:25:11] we have that high priest let us draw
[1:25:14] near amen uh with a True Heart everybody
[1:25:17] say A True Heart in full Assurance of
[1:25:22] faith
[1:25:22] having our heart sprinkled from an evil
[1:25:25] conscience and our bodies washed with
[1:25:27] pure water notice let us everybody say
[1:25:30] let us hold fast our
[1:25:34] profession let us hold fast our
[1:25:37] confession I'm going to get into more of
[1:25:39] that uh next next week or so let us hold
[1:25:43] fast our profession the profession of
[1:25:46] our faith without wavering for he is
[1:25:49] faithful that promis are you Faithful
[1:25:52] amen no it wasn't me I I fell all the
[1:25:55] time brother BR said we backslide every
[1:25:57] day and I'm so glad to hear a prophet
[1:25:58] say that amen that we we backslide and
[1:26:02] and and the moment we sin and and when
[1:26:04] we sin we it's not sin yet when we fall
[1:26:07] it's not sin yet because the moment you
[1:26:09] see that you done wrong you'll repent of
[1:26:11] it can you say Amen so it's not based
[1:26:13] upon our faithfulness he is the one that
[1:26:16] is faithful that promised he was
[1:26:18] faithful to Abraham he was faithful to
[1:26:20] David he was faithful to Eve he was
[1:26:22] faithful Amen to marry he was faithful
[1:26:25] everyone that he would give a promise to
[1:26:27] he proved himself faithfulness in their
[1:26:30] weakness he remained faithful and so is
[1:26:33] he
[1:26:34] today
[1:26:36] amen glory brother Braham said once in
[1:26:38] the presence of God recognizing that we
[1:26:41] could never stand there only through the
[1:26:43] merits of Jesus Christ then we draw nigh
[1:26:45] unto God through the merits of his son
[1:26:48] amen Lord I come to you with an innocent
[1:26:50] heart in in the in the in the name of
[1:26:52] thy son Jesus please receive me oh
[1:26:55] brother you're coming by a living way
[1:26:57] then not Lord you know I quit drinking
[1:27:00] you know I treat my wife right and you
[1:27:01] know I do this and do that you have
[1:27:04] nothing to
[1:27:05] offer can you say Amen so see the law of
[1:27:09] carnal commandment doesn't put you in
[1:27:11] better standing with God it doesn't give
[1:27:14] you anything to offer to God Amen see so
[1:27:18] so so how can anything be offered to
[1:27:22] to God except through the great high
[1:27:24] priest and how can he offer anything but
[1:27:27] blood which would be his own blood amen
[1:27:30] see so so he offers to God no other
[1:27:34] blood but his own ain't that right and
[1:27:37] we know through through Abel amen that
[1:27:40] that that this Blood amen Paul speaks
[1:27:44] about it in Hebrews that this blood
[1:27:47] which is a creative blood God's own
[1:27:49] blood speaks of better things than abble
[1:27:52] blood ain't that right amen now Abel's
[1:27:55] blood was the blood of the old Covenant
[1:27:58] Old Testament this Blood amen that
[1:28:01] redeems us is the blood of the New
[1:28:03] Testament a ain't that right and so it's
[1:28:06] a far greater blood than Abel's blood
[1:28:09] amen and and and so this is God's
[1:28:12] created blood whereas Abel's was sex
[1:28:14] blood sinful blood and and all these
[1:28:16] things and notice Abel's blood cried out
[1:28:18] for
[1:28:19] Revenge yes ain't that right
[1:28:22] Abel's blood cried out for Revenge just
[1:28:25] imagine if if if they would have taken
[1:28:28] uh uh some some righteous man and and
[1:28:31] and hung him on the cross like they'
[1:28:33] done Jesus for our remissions and and
[1:28:35] all these things yet that blood would
[1:28:38] cry out for
[1:28:39] Revenge it would want revenge can you
[1:28:41] say well Abel's blood did it it cried
[1:28:44] out for Revenge can you sayen it spoke
[1:28:46] of guilt and death and sorrow the
[1:28:48] prophet said see and and and that blood
[1:28:51] did not not speak on Abel or on Cain's
[1:28:54] behalf but rather sought Vengeance amen
[1:28:59] if there was no intercession through
[1:29:00] that blood ain't that right see and the
[1:29:03] Bible says that Cain went from the
[1:29:05] presence of the Lord amen but when
[1:29:08] Christ died amen we were already from
[1:29:11] the presence of the Lord but now because
[1:29:13] of that righteous blood because of that
[1:29:15] Holy creative blood being offered to God
[1:29:19] and it's speaking of better things the
[1:29:21] prophet said it speaks of redemption it
[1:29:23] speaks of Joy it speaks of healing it
[1:29:25] speaks of of Fellowship it it it it
[1:29:28] speaks of all the promises of God that
[1:29:30] you're aired to that blood is speaking
[1:29:33] on your behalf amen and it's drawing you
[1:29:36] into the presence of God CU it's not
[1:29:40] seeking
[1:29:41] revengeance can you say amen amen all do
[1:29:45] you love
[1:29:46] him amen it speaks for us it speaks for
[1:29:50] us that blood speaks for us right amen
[1:29:53] and so by that blood God himself became
[1:29:56] our great high priest Lord and by his
[1:29:59] blood his own blood God can fulfill his
[1:30:02] word in you can you say amen he couldn't
[1:30:06] do it by the blood of an animal couldn't
[1:30:08] do it by just blood of a sinful man
[1:30:12] sinful blood amen but he created the
[1:30:15] blood amen he met a need can you say
[1:30:18] amen amen when you think of it there was
[1:30:20] no blood on the Earth Could That Could
[1:30:22] That Could wipe our sins away there
[1:30:25] there was no blood powerful enough amen
[1:30:27] that could atone for our sins and bring
[1:30:29] us back into reconciliation we were same
[1:30:32] in the same spot that that that that
[1:30:34] Abraham was on the mountain up there
[1:30:37] when he needed a sacrifice and there was
[1:30:39] no sacrifice around what are you going
[1:30:41] to do well what are we going to do can
[1:30:43] you say Amen but in the in the time that
[1:30:46] there was a need God provided that need
[1:30:48] and created and his own his his own
[1:30:53] blood Hebrews
[1:30:55] 7:11 uh through 18 says if therefore
[1:30:58] Perfection were by the levitical
[1:31:00] priesthood for under it the people
[1:31:02] received the law what further need was
[1:31:04] that there be another Pro priest that
[1:31:06] should rise after the order of MDC and
[1:31:08] not be called after the order of Aaron
[1:31:11] for the priest being priesthood being
[1:31:13] changed there was is made of necessity a
[1:31:17] change also of the law for he of whom
[1:31:20] these things are spoken pertaineth to
[1:31:22] another tribe of which no man gave
[1:31:25] attendance to at the altar for it is
[1:31:28] evidence that our Lord sprang out of
[1:31:31] Judah of which tribe Moses spake nothing
[1:31:34] concerning priesthood what a
[1:31:37] surprise that God's able to meet the
[1:31:40] need and it is yet far more evident for
[1:31:45] that after the similitude of MDC there
[1:31:48] ariseth another priest who is made not
[1:31:52] after everybody say not after the law of
[1:31:55] a carnal commandment but after the power
[1:31:57] of an endless life amen for he
[1:32:00] testifieth that thou art a priest
[1:32:03] Forever After the order of MDC for there
[1:32:06] is verily a dising of the Commandment
[1:32:09] going before for the weakness and
[1:32:12] unprofitableness
[1:32:14] thereof there was weakness in the law it
[1:32:17] was
[1:32:18] unprofitable can you say Amen see but
[1:32:22] where did this high priest come from out
[1:32:25] of the tribe of Judah not out of Levi
[1:32:29] ofi brother BR says they were they were
[1:32:31] legalist that tribe of Levi they they
[1:32:34] they they they that lineage their their
[1:32:36] priesthood they they were they were
[1:32:38] carnal legalists but here he's not made
[1:32:41] after the law of carnal commandment in
[1:32:44] legalist law could not produce him ain't
[1:32:48] that right see the law said Thou shalt
[1:32:50] not kill Thou shalt not steal Thou shalt
[1:32:52] not commit adultery Thou shalt not do
[1:32:53] this and this and this and that see and
[1:32:56] and then Here Comes Jesus there in
[1:32:57] Matthew 2 5:28 and I but I say unto you
[1:33:00] you know that whosoever lookth upon a
[1:33:02] woman to lust after her hath committed
[1:33:04] adultery with her in his heart already
[1:33:06] see so brother BR says see there you are
[1:33:08] that ought to teach women how to dress
[1:33:10] and how to do what's right you dress
[1:33:12] wrong cause men to look at you in in the
[1:33:14] wrong way you're guilty of committing
[1:33:16] adultery just the same as you went
[1:33:18] through the ACT Jesus said so ain't that
[1:33:20] right but Christ is not made after the
[1:33:23] the carnal law or the the the law of of
[1:33:27] carnal commandment and I and I want to
[1:33:29] say to you tonight that that the neither
[1:33:31] is the elect the elect of God is not
[1:33:34] made after a carnal
[1:33:36] commandment can you say man they they
[1:33:39] tried to they tried to do it see carinal
[1:33:41] commandment see brother BR says see
[1:33:42] that's legal old brother I shouldn't I
[1:33:44] shouldn't I know see but that's not it
[1:33:47] see it's love that does it everybody say
[1:33:50] it's love that does it see how how how
[1:33:53] we went through it see he said see if I
[1:33:55] said about my wife oh I'd like to have
[1:33:58] two wives I'd like to run around with
[1:34:00] this one and do this one there and all
[1:34:02] that but but if I do my wife will
[1:34:04] divorce me and my kids will see then my
[1:34:06] Ministry be lost and all that he said
[1:34:08] you dirty rotten hypocrite that's right
[1:34:10] see you don't love her right in the
[1:34:12] first place that's exactly right if you
[1:34:13] loved her there'll be no law about it
[1:34:16] amen can you say Amen there'd be no law
[1:34:19] about it see you'd love her anyhow you
[1:34:21] you you and and you stick with her
[1:34:23] that's exactly right and you women will
[1:34:25] do the same thing to your husband that's
[1:34:27] right he said see sometime women become
[1:34:30] to a place and he's a man see some
[1:34:32] little Jezebel all painted up and you
[1:34:34] know he'll go out around and fall for
[1:34:35] her maybe a good wife you know and and
[1:34:40] then you call yourself a Christian shame
[1:34:42] on you you need another dose of the
[1:34:43] altar see see so so so you know i' I've
[1:34:47] been where you know uh uh and and I'll
[1:34:50] get ready to close but the
[1:34:53] uh apostolics that we they didn't they
[1:34:56] didn't believe in television either but
[1:34:58] a lot of them snuck them in their homes
[1:35:00] you know as long as the pastor didn't
[1:35:02] know you know that way they we get
[1:35:04] preach that and and these things but see
[1:35:06] that's the law of carnal
[1:35:08] Commandments if you're doing something
[1:35:11] by law if it just becomes law Church
[1:35:13] coming coming to church just becomes a
[1:35:15] law to you it's if if serving the lord
[1:35:19] just becomes a law if Holiness just
[1:35:20] becomes a law to us then then there's
[1:35:23] something wrong you understand what I'm
[1:35:25] saying I I don't think that the the the
[1:35:28] preacher has to keep preaching against
[1:35:30] sin and and sin and sin and sin and sin
[1:35:34] and you know if if there's a people that
[1:35:37] really fall in love with God then that
[1:35:39] sin question is over with ain't that
[1:35:42] right then then then you start walking
[1:35:44] with God on your own uh two feet so to
[1:35:48] speak and and and then you leave the the
[1:35:50] the the the principles the basics and
[1:35:53] then you move on up into Perfection you
[1:35:55] know I mean by now we we should know you
[1:35:58] know that that women don't cut hair and
[1:36:01] all that but you know there's a lot of
[1:36:03] folks that ain't got that Revelation
[1:36:04] even though they do have long hair but
[1:36:06] they'll trim it they'll do everything
[1:36:08] they can they'll burn the ends or
[1:36:10] they'll do this just to get Slide by and
[1:36:12] get away with it and all these things
[1:36:14] but but see it's is a law of carnal
[1:36:16] commandment God's bride is not made up
[1:36:19] that way God's bride is not made up well
[1:36:22] I I'll just go out and wear my shorts as
[1:36:24] long as so certain so the the big mouth
[1:36:26] of the church don't know and all that
[1:36:28] then then I'll be just fine see that way
[1:36:30] the whole church won't know it's a law
[1:36:32] of carnal
[1:36:33] Commandments can you say man it it's
[1:36:36] just the truth anyways so so see the
[1:36:39] legalist law makes Hypocrites it does
[1:36:41] not make bride it does not produce a
[1:36:44] perfected heart amen it just makes it
[1:36:47] just makes Hypocrites out of the people
[1:36:50] ain't that right but see there's only
[1:36:52] one that can make us perfect and that is
[1:36:54] Christ and he is made after amen the
[1:36:57] power of an endless life amen and so is
[1:37:01] the church the church is made after the
[1:37:05] same material and that is the power of
[1:37:08] an endless
[1:37:09] life amen that's exactly right
[1:37:12] Hallelujah Hebrews 7 and 20 it says in
[1:37:16] in as much as not without an oath he was
[1:37:20] made priest
[1:37:21] in other
[1:37:22] words he couldn't have been made priest
[1:37:25] without an
[1:37:26] oath but there was an oath that that
[1:37:29] went with this ain't that right see for
[1:37:33] those priests that levitical priesthood
[1:37:35] ironic priesthood was made without an
[1:37:38] oath amen but this
[1:37:41] priest this great high priest amen see
[1:37:46] with an oath by him that said unto him
[1:37:49] the Lord swear and will not repent amen
[1:37:52] aren't you glad for that bless the Lord
[1:37:55] the Lord swear and would not repent thou
[1:37:58] art a priest Forever After the order of
[1:38:01] MDC amen see the difference the
[1:38:05] levitical priesthood they didn't it
[1:38:07] wasn't an oath that put him in there it
[1:38:09] wasn't
[1:38:10] Divine uh uh God swearing right that
[1:38:16] this was going to be amen because if it
[1:38:19] was that way then the levitical
[1:38:20] priesthood would
[1:38:21] continue ain't that right but brother
[1:38:25] Bri said see this the priest of the
[1:38:27] levitical priesthood come down through
[1:38:29] generations go to school learn to be
[1:38:31] preachers and so forth they come down
[1:38:33] God made them priests like that see they
[1:38:35] made themselves priests by their
[1:38:37] education by their inheritance and so
[1:38:39] forth like that ain't that right and and
[1:38:42] the carnal church has made itself
[1:38:45] thus right it's existing without an
[1:38:49] oath good think about it ain't that
[1:38:51] right right but we're not as that carnal
[1:38:54] Church understand there's a lot of
[1:38:56] churches out there but but but many are
[1:38:59] existing with without an oath can you
[1:39:02] say Amen there's a lot claiming
[1:39:05] Christianity but many are existing
[1:39:07] without an oath all right we see a lot
[1:39:10] of preachers claiming to be preachers
[1:39:11] ain't preachers
[1:39:12] lick amen
[1:39:15] hello no anointing behind it no nothing
[1:39:18] pre all right maybe someone just told
[1:39:21] them they ought to go out and preach or
[1:39:22] had a dream or something that they
[1:39:24] should be preaching or whatever but
[1:39:26] there's no
[1:39:27] confirmation am can you say Amen well
[1:39:30] that's the same way with anything you
[1:39:32] see people come in and then they go and
[1:39:34] then you get you get saved and then
[1:39:35] they're they're back out doing the same
[1:39:37] old things and and all that that there
[1:39:40] there there was something see it's
[1:39:42] without an oath can you say Amen but
[1:39:45] Christ Our great high priest was a
[1:39:47] priest that was made by an oath ain't
[1:39:50] that right right and and and Paul would
[1:39:52] tell us the word of the oath maketh the
[1:39:57] son hello that's what he said in Hebrews
[1:40:01] the word of the oath is what made the
[1:40:05] Son and the word of God's predestinated
[1:40:09] oath made the
[1:40:11] church come on that's right praise the
[1:40:14] Lord you believe it yes
[1:40:16] sir amen so brother Brown
[1:40:19] said
[1:40:21] the law could not produce nothing like
[1:40:23] that because it was carnal the church
[1:40:25] cannot produce nothing like that
[1:40:27] denominations the denominations because
[1:40:29] they are carnal the seminaries can never
[1:40:32] produce anything like that they try to
[1:40:34] educate the world to it they try to
[1:40:36] organize
[1:40:37] it uh uh it to it they tried every way
[1:40:41] in the world to make everything that
[1:40:42] they could and leaving off the main
[1:40:44] thing you got to be born again amen God
