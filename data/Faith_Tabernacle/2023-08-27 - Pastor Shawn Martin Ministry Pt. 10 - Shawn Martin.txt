but to worship a god of reality amen and it's not because we say so it's because God's proved it he showed us where he is and who he is and so we're thankful that we're not a people that has brother Branham said I believe in Satan's Eden he said that people worshiping Satan thinking they're worshiping God and and but by God's grace and that's all we can say it's just been by God's grace that he has revealed himself to us and we ought to love him more than we ever have before we ought to be a people that are so thankful in this day amen and we certainly love the Lord do you love him amen certainly enjoyed these songs the musicians can be dismissed and appreciate the musicians and they they have a way of creating an atmosphere and and God is in music and he's in singing enjoyed the songs today enjoyed the worship you know it's good to to be in service when the saints are anticipating and just come to Worship the Lord and I just love him if you have your Bibles we're going to turn to the book of Hosea the 12th chapter and while you're turning um there's a flyer um from Brother Jeff's Snodgrass there in Logan Ohio his church Christian Fellowship Church they're having their annual fall owship meetings and um the minister to be announced but it'll be uh Friday Saturday and Sunday of October 20th 21st and 22nd and so if you're able to go I'm sure they would appreciate that and we'll put this flyer in the back there but anyways they'll have activities for the Youth on Saturday and anyways they got the information there and of course Labor Day weekend is next weekend and so man it's just hard to believe we're entering into September already and um but brother Ron Spencer of course be having his uh annual meeting um Labor Day there weekend and I believe it starts on Friday does anyone is this uses start Friday through Sunday and uh so I I haven't seen a flyer I tried to look it up so I don't know what time it would be but we could ask and find out if you're needing to know but so just remember that I believe it's brother Timothy Pruitt brother Tim Pruitt and brother Donnie Reagan will be ministering there and so I'm sure it'll be a wonderful time and um also I am going to be in Pennsylvania that weekend uh ministering uh me and brother Andrew and brother Wendell and brother Jonathan are supposed to be ministering brother Jim shoemaker putting on a family camp and so we will um I I will be there and brother Terry will be ministering uh next weekend as well and I have decided just to do a a morning service uh Sunday and so um once again there

and brother Ronnie long will be here to minister at that time um uh brother Wendell usually has his uh meetings in the middle of September and he's moved them up and so it's now back to back uh with

Wednesday and then leave out Thursday so we covet your prayers as we will be praying for you all here and believing you all to have a a wonderful time in the Lord and um uh brother hadn't had a good week there at brother Tim farmers and uh brother uh Steve Alves and brother Amos delivered their heart and the people uh just seemed to be blessed brother Tim seemed to be blessed and and so we're we're thankful for that and you know it's good to be around the people of God and uh um I think it was brother Matthew's first time leading songs amen so he done a good job there and so we thankful thankful to the Lord and um I don't guess I ever ever done a meeting with brother Amos before so it was an honor to to do a meeting with brother Amos and brother Steve and but also heard it's uh David's birthday saying man is it your birthday today well happy birthday you know we ain't got no music but we'll do it acapella how about that uh versus my leaders happy birthday to you happy birthday to you happy birthday another David happy birthday to you [Music] amen so he's turned three today what is it oh eight okay I figured I'd get a reaction so David's eight years old praise the Lord amen well we we appreciate these young people amen well uh as we go to the word of the Lord before we read let's just bow our heads and talk to our Lord father we come to you Lord just anticipating for you to speak to us and Lord the only way you have done it is is you work through the agency of men and father we don't take our position lightly Lord and that we just humbly asked that you would just now come and use the gift that you placed with the Enemy Lord and help me just to get myself out of the way and I pray Lord that you would just speak to your people and may the people be anointed Lord to hear and to understand and to receive father Lord take what simple words that we would have today and just multiplied in our hearts that we could be drawn closer to you and better prepared for the Rapture at hand we ask it father and we just Commit This service into your hands in Jesus Christ's name and everyone says amen and amen Hosea the 12th chapter we read this here recently but it says I have and the tenth verse I have also spoken by the prophets and I have multiplied visions and used similitudes by the ministry of the prophets amen you can have your seats this morning and again just looking at Ministry God having a Ministry today and as we have said that this ministry is the agency by which God's purpose is accomplished and today by the message of the hour we we have come and are still coming to understand uh God's purpose and what was in his mind from the foundation of the world and we can spend much time talking about the purpose of God and and what he has in his mind but again most of us know his his what his purpose is of course if you uh listen to the message uh Christ is the mystery of God revealed uh brother Branham goes into it and and it's a if you haven't listened to it or been a while you ought to go back and listen to it and just sit down and really listen you don't ask the Lord to reveal it to you but brother Branham says it's a threefold purpose and he says number one God wanted to reveal himself to the people he couldn't do it as a great Jehovah God who covered all space Time and Eternity could not he is too great to ever be revealed to people because it would be too mysterious but he what he wanted to do he loved fatherhood so for he was a father and the only way he could express it was to become a son of man that's the only way he could express himself was to become son of man he wanted to express himself and that was one of his great threefold purposes was to express himself identify himself with human beings to reveal himself in Christ amen but then he said the second uh uh of his threefold purpose was to have the preeminence in his body of Believers that is his bride that he might live in people amen and he says he could do that in Adam and Eve but sin separated them so now there had to be some way to get it back again ain't that right now he asked the question why didn't he just keep Adam and Eve from sinning and and that's been a question uh I'm you know that that the world has and it's been a a mystery but then brother Branham opens that to us and and how simple it is but uh profound but but he says he God would have never been able to express his fullness and his full attributes if if he uh uh kept them from sinning for he is savior he's not only father and uh but he's savior he's healer he's Redeemer and deliverer and Etc so only through Christ only through Christ could he Express these attributes in his fullness only through Christ could it be a son uh could be a Healer could be a deliverer a redeemer only through Christ good God to even have a bride it was only through Christ and so uh Paul would tell us in Colossians 2 and 9 that all the fullness of uh the godhead dwelt bodily in Christ amen it was all in him and and and then the prophet says then to bring that fullness of godhead bodily now you think of that then to bring that fullness of godhead bodily into a people so it isn't just all in Christ uh in that body but now it's to bring that that all the godhead in fullness bodily into a people that he could have the preeminence the oversight the leading till he could express himself through them aren't you glad for that there is a reason that God called us to this message I I man and and the more it unfolds the more happy we we we we become the the more uh uh grateful that we become uh because it is not just we didn't come from one brother Branham was not a reformer he did not come to take us out of one thing into another thing and but this is to make us part of God's mystery it's an unfolding of God's mystery that he had in the beginning you are why Christ died you are why I mean God uh all of these things but then the third part of of this threefold ministry is to restore the kingdom to its rightly position that failed by sin by the first Adam back to where he walked in the cool of the evening with his people talked with them and fellowshipped with them ain't that right now in the message the Masterpiece brother Branham says when God the great sculptor uh seemed the fall of of his family uh the Masterpiece he wasn't willing just to leave it lay there face down and ruin he went to work immediately to build it up again amen he wasn't willing that it should perish and lay there like that all the time because he is God and he will not be defeated you know brother Brown said we are his victory amen God will not be defeated so he went to work immediately and began to build again unto his own image amen ain't that right see when Adam and Eve listen to the LIE of the devil the prophet said the holy image of God left them a man their Fellowship was broken with God The Fellowship of Oneness with God was broken they and then the message the seed shall not bear with the shot man fail like the seed has to fall and then God began to brood over that after the fall he brought up an Enoch he brought up an Elijah he brought up a Moses he brought a prophet after Prophet trying to restore that image again and finally upon the Earth came the genuine image of God himself again which was God the logos made flesh and dwelt Among Us amen and I'm so glad for that aren't you glad for that a man that we can identify I we were driving down for church and I saw a sign on the on of the Church of the of a title of a message for this morning and it was uh uh deity but yet man and and and I I thought well I would change that and I would put man but yet deity amen man and and I tell my wife you know I'd kind of like to hear what he's got to say about that or she I don't know these days but uh uh you know are they going to dwell on the deity are they going to dwell on the man part but I I tell you there is only a prophet that come to really let us know what was in that man and and that was the deity of God and without that deity you wouldn't be here today without that deity you you wouldn't be called the sons of God can you say Amen you would be called a church member you would be called a religious guy you would be called a theologian or whatever but we are called the sons of God because all of God was poured into that man and it you're saved by the blood of God you're Redeemed by The Works of God it's all about God ain't that rhyme amen and we're so glad for that that God would send a prophet and really focus on the deity side and what that really means to us but notice he says now that's same logos has a part A man he's got a bride and the same logos this word cannot be tampered with is brooding over the churches today trying to bring back the word to its full manifestation aren't you glad for that not not in Christ in that physical body but now in the bride amen the the the the mystical body the spiritual body of Jesus Christ amen so again trying to bring back the word to its full manifestation you know uh uh people today are are deceived into thinking that God doesn't mind you staying a sinner amen and and he loves you the way you are and and how how perverted uh uh man's thinking has become of God's love amen and and they just you know they they believe it doesn't matter what you do as long as you love Jesus and but yet Jesus said if you love me keep my Commandments ain't that right amen but but they say well God knows I I you know knows us and we just can't help it and da da da but this is why Christ died is to pour His fullness inside of you in in the in the Church of today and if you're part of that church then you're part of God ain't that right amen see so uh God does not have to accept our worship amen just because we worship just because a man says he loves God does not mean that God has to accept that on that basis just because uh uh the people come together and they begin to sing Christian songs and and and and and preach from out of this Bible and and go through the religious things of of what Christian does a man in the duties and all that does not mean mean that God has to accept it amen there's there's many times that God would tell this uh well in one place I believe that that that God told Israel Israel not a heathen Nation but Israel your sacrifices are a stink unto me a man you have pluted the table you have pluted the altars you have you you've you see and so all their worship have become formal all their worship all their duties had just become without sincerity and and all these things and God did not have to accept it and he did not accept it ain't that right amen he does not have to accept our beliefs just because we say it's right amen see true Christianity is not a bunch of Sinners running around living filthy and disrespectful to the word of God it does not consist of people a uh uh uh you know ignoring the word of God and being your irreverent to his plan and his way amen and this is where the Deception comes in is people all around the world is is is uh coming to a church they're worshiping and and and they're singing Christian songs and and I guess most of them are Christian a lot of them taking the blood out and a lot of them taking the power out and and I don't know what you know so but but you know and then they they preaching from a Bible where and they got through all kinds of translations to make sure that they get it right and and all of these things see but but but yet it's a deception of the devil amen and and you just have to say it because the prophet said it that way it's it's they're deceived amen but see God is trying to bring back a man his full manifestation uh uh uh to bring back the word to its full manifestation can you say Amen amen yeah uh uh there so you see God wants to have fellowship with you amen that's what a prophet says he Longs for you he Longs for you amen God has passions God God has desires amen just if you've been away a man from your spouse for for for whatever length of time and and and you know uh maybe uh months you know and and you can't wait to get back uh and and see her and and and and uh talk with her or and you're even your children just just to be around them and you've been away and and and maybe you hadn't got to talk to him maybe having uh you know uh uh but but you know you're coming home to see them and and man uh I've been there you know and and and just the the idea of getting to be with them again and my heart just aches for home and the fellowship and well that's what God does amen and that's what the prophet said he Longs for you amen God Longs amen see so he wants to transform you by the renewing of your mind amen see a man not to transform you to the church a man or to a denomination but to transform you to his word ain't that right amen see and so uh brother Branham said see transformed from the church and the world into Sons and Daughters of God Amen that's what God's after he wants to transform you uh from the world from the church from the denominations and and and and and and and traditions and all of that into Sons and Daughters of God and if that desire is in you then that shows that you're part of that word can you say man amen now there's a lot of people that just stop at being religious and they have no desire to go on but a real Christian a real true predestinated seed of God desires to move on desires to go on desire the more I I tell my wife today you know I I I I I just I the reason I get ministers in that just just so solid on this message and preaches this message and because it not only challenges you it challenges me as well amen because if you're not careful you get you get complacent you get complacent but then when a minister Rises up and he's preaching that message and he's directing us to the message and and and the anointing is there and all that it it brings an Enlightenment it it just it wants me to go further into this message it just wants me to go deeper into this message and study more pray more or give more to it you understand what I'm saying amen see and so now notice the prophet said True predestinated Believers will stay with the word because they're part of that word ain't that right amen True predestinated Believers will stay with the word because they are part of that word there is what the Bible called wandering stars and and and you know what they are they're wandering out in the world and they're going from one denomination to another one Church to another one idea to another and and they're never stable and and the prophet locking them like a leaf that is blowing in the wind as is falling to the ground and and you never know where it's going to end because the wind is just blowing it it's so unstable it's just at the wind's Mercy if you want to call it that amen and that's the way the wandering stars are in in the world today ain't that right but God does not want us to be be a Wandering Star a man God wants us to stay with that word and to become part of the word and to reflect the word and to be the word can you say Amen not ideas not not theories not doctrines in in the intellectual but down in the heart the word becoming part of us and we becoming part of the word so then we we find that we have talked about the ministry of angels and how that they are there with the Believers a man and they they are with us to minister spiritual blessings to us to help us along the road that too to to help fulfill God's purpose in our lives amen they encourage us the prophet said as we see the uh Zion you know uh up yonder in sight you know and and and the Comfort us they energize us with faith and and move us along see they are with every three predestinated seed of God Amen now you don't have to see the Angels a man to know that they're with you ain't that right amen you you don't now Elisha did not see the angels and yet he said more are they that are with us than they that are with them amen and I I thought all along that he was seeing angels and that little old servant wasn't seeing nothing and and and then I hear a prophet say Elisha never saw one Angel amen but he knew they were there because God promised that them Angels would be there can you say Amen so you don't have to see Angels now I know there are our brothers that that talk about it and and they've seen an angel the angel visits them and and maybe on a daily basis the prophet talked about seeing the angel of God and all that and and and you know you say well I don't see nothing is God for me is god with me you don't look at that I think God if if men can see Angels that's wonderful amen I'd love to see the pillar of fire there's other people that say they've seen the pillar of fire and at different times and and I'd like to say man I'd like to see that you know but I'm glad I got a picture there that we can see it there amen and and know what head uh uh who's who's it's over right amen but but uh so so there there are Supernatural things and people do see things but that doesn't mean that they're any more than what you are you just have to believe that them angels are with you you just have to believe it that little servant couldn't believe that so so God uh Elisha the prophet prayed that God would open his eyes and and then he saw what Elisha did not see but Elisha was already declaring that they were there because he believed it he believed the promise of God can you say amen amen say so so uh uh uh uh Psalms 34 7 the angel of the Lord in campeth round about them that fear Him and delivereth them amen you have to believe that ain't that right see so when people of God come together do you realize the angels of God are there I believe the angels of God are here right now amen I I I just believe that you realize that when you talk of God the angels are there amen when you talk about God and this is why the prophet said clean your house up amen because you you want the angels to entertain your home you clean it up you know hey clean it up because uh angels are there with you ain't that right now notice the prophet of God says and this ought to encourage us the angel of the Lord everybody say the angel of the Lord accompanies this message always amen if you're a believer of this message the angel of the Lord are with you now now he does not accompany a man's gift ain't that right amen he accompanies this message you know they're they're I I've said it last night say it again but there are uh uh Ministries or ministers I've seen ministers that that got too big for their britches if you want to say it that way and and and uh I I see ministers a lot of times that that can't you know can't submit to the message because they got their they they got their Ministry to promote they got their ideas to promote they've got amen they're following that they want you know and and so it's it's above them or beneath them what they're insulting to them if we could say it that way just to quote what a prophet said they want to do away with the quotes they want to do away well you're quoting the prophet too much and all I'm not afraid to quote a prophet I I just ain't because it's it's there and and and so but then they'll walk away from this message and they become nobodies they become nobodies because they thought it was them that was making their Ministry and they didn't realize it was the message of of the hour and if you want an approval of God if you want a blessings of God stay with this message preach the message and not our own ideas stay with the message amen and and whatever it takes study this message and you'll find the anointing of God with you and parents teach the message to your children you'll find the presence of God with you play the message in your home you'll find the presence of God with you entertain this message and you'll find the presence of God with you for the angel of the Lord you say well I'm a preacher it does not matter God does not have to back you up amen you say well I'm a Christian that God doesn't have to back that up amen you stay with the message and the angel of the Lord will always be with the message of the hour you you begin to testify of the message of God Amen I know people are scared and Afraid and ashamed Amen to talk about the message to people amen but you begin to talk to the the people about this message and watch the presence of God God show up amen the presence of the Lord the angel of the Lord will be with you amen when you talk about this message can you say amen amen so so the uh uh uh uh people have been mistaken Amen to believe that that will we're Baptist so God has to prove it God doesn't have to prove of that he doesn't have to prove that you're dancing and you're shouting and you're screaming and you're crying and you're slobbering and he doesn't have to improve of nothing amen may you stay with the message he'll approve of it amen because the angel of the Lord stays with the message can you say Amen do you love the Lord and you don't have to see the angel of the Lord to believe it just believe it just believe it and watch him go to work ain't that right now we find that there's the ministry of the holy spirit amen Psalms 18 32 it says it is God that girdeth me with strength and maketh my way perfect amen aren't you glad for that he makes my feet like kine's feet he set us me up on my high places he teaches My Hands to War so that a bowl of Steel uh is broken by my arms amen thou Hast also given me the shield of thy salvation and thy right hand hath Holden me up and thy gentleness hath made me great thou Hast enlarged my steps under me that my feet did not slip this is the ministry of the holy spirit amen it's 40 uh verse 47 it is God that Avengers me and subdueth the people under me he delivers me from my enemies yea thou Lift Us me up above those that rise up against me thou Hast delivered me from the violent man amen see there's Deliverance in the ministry of the Holy Spirit there's not Deliverance in the ministry of denominations a theologian a psychologist just are just a plain old preacher amen but there is a Deliverance in the holy spirit amen that's why we want the Holy Spirit to back us up we want the holy spirit in our churches we do not want to grieve the Holy Spirit we want the holy spirit in our homes we want it in our car we want it in our lab we want it here this morning amen because the Deliverance comes from the ministry of the Holy Spirit not from a preacher amen not from the pope not from a deacon or whatever it comes by the Holy Spirit May the Holy Spirit have his way Amen to break loose the shackles and the fatters amen to find every demon of Hell amen that would try to come upon the children of God it's by the Holy Spirit now Romans 8 33 it says who shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect it is God that justifieth oh aren't you glad for the ministry of the Holy Spirit who is he that condemneth it is Christ that died yea rather that is risen again who is even at the right hand of God who also maketh the intercession for us it's the ministry of the Holy Spirit can you say Amen oh do you believe that he maketh intercession for you even Paul says that we don't even know a lot of times what we're uttering what to groan and the Holy Spirit within us begins to utter and make intercessions can you say amen amen that's right see so there's a lot that we can say about the ministry of the Holy Spirit but seek God's purpose is what he had in his mind before the world began he wrote those names in the Lamb's Book of Life he foreknew them he called them he justified them he glorified them he predestinated them to be conformed to the image of his dear son he predestinated them to the adoption of sons he predestinated that they would be his church without spot wrinkle or blemish he predestinated them to be his bride and you know what he is their father he is their bridegroom ain't that Ryan he is their redeemer he is their deliverer he is he he is there all in all ain't that right so now listen um as as we go in the beginning and and you can find this in in Satan's Eden but but by having faith in all his word his seeds God brought and Eden of Holiness and love and eternal life faith in all of God's word brought an Eden of Holiness love understanding Perfection eternal life ain't that right well that's God's law was faith God believed his own law ain't that right so he was able to create an Eden he was able to create a uh I don't know if Utopia if that would be the right word I don't know but he was able to a place of perfection an an atmosphere that was incredible that Satan could not penetrate Satan could not touch them and all of these things but but and it was done because faith in all of God's word brought this Eden see but then the prophet tells us it was surrendered by a woman Eve and now Satan has succeeded in perverting and taken over taking over this world and making it his kingdom that were that man was put on by free moral agency to choose for themselves of what kind of Life they desire notice by unbelief everybody say by unbelief by unbelief in all of God's word has brought the seed of unholiness in Satan's Eden so so by belief in God's word it God was able to to make an Eden a Perfection but by unbelief in all God's word now Satan is able to work and and he's able has brought the seed of unholiness in Satan's Eden we are now entering in where Satan has taken the throne as the Antichrist in an Eden of this Earth an Eden of sin perverted religion how did it come by unbelief amen he started not upon saying I am Satan I'm the great Angel no not upon that but upon perverting God's word and that's how he's brought his kingdom in every age and now in this great deceitful age he's ready to take his throne by his people by unbelievers he has built himself an intellectual education it is scientific Eden right scientific preacher scientific Church scientific theology everything is scientific everything is based upon knowledge amen the whole church is built upon knowledge it ain't built upon faith Satan's church is built upon knowledge not Faith Can you say Amen so that means if Satan is able to create his Eden by Faith by by knowledge not upon Faith than it God a man builds his church upon faith and faith is a revelation can you say amen that's right so now notice what the prophet says a genuine everybody say genuine a genuine son or daughter of God takes God's word first I don't care what anybody else says about it they take God's word first see there's poison in the cut they believe it right and it that's and it that's what God is planting his word his seed that's what his church will be at the end it will be the same thing it'll be the same thing they just take God at his word and that's it ain't that right so God's Eden was surrendered by a woman Eve but it was redeemed the prophet said by a man the man Jesus Christ which is the word so God brought the prophets that God will take it back someday by a man surrendered by a woman amen and so has it been the church today surrendered it all the uh the blessings of Pentecost a man that fell on on the day of Pentecost it was surrendered all of that surrendered over by the church a woman ain't that right but God promised he's going to restore it back ain't that right now notice of course this man is Jesus Christ and Jesus Christ he says I go to prepare a place for you amen now notice uh uh uh hear Isaiah 65 17 it says behold this is God speaking behold I create a new Heaven and a new Earth and the former shall not be remembered nor come into mind but be ye glad and rejoice forever in that which I create for behold I create Jerusalem a rejoicing and her people a joy ain't that right amen so it tells us that we're not going to be here much longer amen that he's already been creating something new for us amen it's a prepared City for prepared people amen Revelations 21 1 and I saw a new Heaven and a new Earth for the first Heaven and the first Earth were passed away and there was no more sea and I John saw the holy city New Jerusalem coming down from God out of Heaven prepared as a bride adorned for her husband and I heard a great voice out of Heaven saying behold the Tabernacle of God is with men and he will dwell with him and they shall be his people and God himself shall be with them and be their God and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes and there shall be no more death neither sorrow nor crime see it's a total Eden than what you're in right now uh we're in this Eden and we have sorrow we have pain we have amen uh Agony and and all of these things but he says I'm the thing that I'm going to create I'll wipe your tears to where you'll never shed a tear again there'll never be any death sorrow crying neither will there be any more pain for the former things are passed away and he that set up on the throne said behold I make all things new and he said right unto me right for those were these words are true and faithful now we know uh from uh uh the future home brother Brown said it's not going to be a total annihilation of of this Earth but it's going to be a completely restored Earth a man just like it's not a total annihilation of you a man when he said you're a new creature or a new creation amen but it's a new something new amen a complete restoration amen it's a transformation do you believe that and guess what it's going to be a restored by the elect believing the word of God God is going to establish his Eden again not by him just believing his word but now him coming from the heavens dwelling in you impersonating himself in the church by his own faith believing his own word and what he is believing in you he's creating then you say man this Eden it will be restored by an elect believing the word of God and and in in church this transformation is already happening do you believe it amen do you feel it amen it's already happening amen notice amen Romans 12 2 and be not conformed to this world but be ye transformed yes can you say that with me be ye transformed who's that you be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God ain't that right now notice what the prophet said going from your own carnal mind to taking on his mind to do the perfect and acceptable will of God you're being transformed right now amen you were born with the carnal mind you was born with carnal ways you was born without understanding of God Amen but now has come a transformation that has taken place in a group of people amen the carnal mind is becoming more subdued and they're taking on the very mind of Christ and while they're taking on this mind he is becoming more known to them amen the Mysteries that were hidden in his mind is now becoming aware and known into this bride Hallelujah you taken on his mind amen you're understanding who you are he's already understood who you were he's the one that predestinated you he's the one that called you but now you're taking on that very same mind and now you're Awakening to he is a mystery revealed in you your Awakening to what he's already had in his mind you're now being transformed and your mind is being renewed that how could it be renewed without a prophet brother Brown says now we have been saved as we are or now that we have been saved as we are and that we have been filled with the Holy Spirit as we have now everybody say now what's the next thing now we want the mind of that was in Christ to be in us that we might be transformed from the Natural Things of life you see that the Rapture is happening already it's taken place in you there's a preparation going on it ain't it ain't just a three-week Revival it's not just a one-night Revival it's not just a preacher coming to excite us it's happening for a reason it's an eternal thing that's working in us that you might be transformed not just come to an altar and then go back smoking again not coming up here and said oh I believe I believe and then going back to the way you used to be this is a transformation that has taken place the last thing that is going to be transforming this is old body can you say Amen that you're taking on the mind of God right now you're seeing as God you're believing as God you're confessing as God Amen this world ain't got no hold on us I don't care what Trump does I don't care what the Democrats do I've got another kingdom and it's become a known to me how else would we really understand there's a heaven out there and a future home if we had not the mind of Christ but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind that we might be transformed from the Natural Things of life and be brought in to do the perfect will of God by transformation of God's spirit by his word aren't you glad for that John 5 24 Jesus said verily verily I say unto you he that heareth my word and believeth everybody say believeth see it's not just hearing that this you say well I I hear it amen but anyone can hear it but he that heareth my word see how is this transformation going to come how is this Eden going to be restored how is your body going to be restored how's the translation going to take place it had to be by the renewing of your mind and the word had to come forth the word had to be restored pure word of God balance word of God Vindicated word of God can you say amen and you're now taking upon the mind of Christ and he that here is my word and believeth everybody say believeth on him that sent me hath everlasting life amen see you cannot help when you meditate upon the word of God when you believe that word of God when you receive the word of God you can't help but have a bright future shall have everlasting life and shall not come into condemnation but it's passed from Death unto life if you believe this message as a Believer you will not be disappointed in the end I just have to tell you you will not be disappointed Amen in the end when the tribulation comes you ain't going to be here when a Rapture takes place you'll be there can you say amen for it says it shall not come into condemnation that is already passed from death into life yes the tribulation is nothing but the judgments of God falling on those that have rejected this message can you say Amen that's why the prophet said it's grace to you that God would send a prophet it's grace to you that you would believe this message it's Grace he that heareth my word and believeth on him that sent me hath everlasting life and shall not everybody say shall not shall not see God cannot judge that body not his body he cannot judge it it's already been judged he put her judgment upon himself at Calvary see shall not come into condemnation but is passed from Death unto life and what is he he is the Living Word of this hour now brother Branham says I believe again in Satan's Eden he says today we don't try to establish the word of God in the people's heart see that's why the people can't be transformed and in in by the renewing of their mind if we do not establish the word of God and I'm not talking about a Baptist word Pentecostal word I'm talking about the message of this hour then then the people cannot be transformed by the renewing of their mind I just that's just the way I believe it amen if if if if God established his first Eden and established everything at that time amen by faith in all of his word it's got to be a requirement today that a people on this Earth are going to believe all of his word or why would God restore the word why would God take the time to send a prophet in this age and the lamb to open the book and give that open book to his Prophet that seventh angel to reveal it to the people if there ain't going to be no believer but he would do it in this time because it's time for a Rapture it's time we're at the end of everything it's time didn't Jesus say when you see these things begin to happen lift up your head don't don't don't put your head in the in the voting booth booth [Applause] lift up your head get your head out of the out of the television and lift up your head get your head out of politics and lift up your head I don't think it's just a literal head I think it's your mind everything about you get your mind out of the gutter and lift your thinking up get your vision off the future of America and and lift your head up there's a bright future [Music] ain't that right isn't that what John after wrote in Revelations 4 1 after these things after the church ages amen I Heard a Voice in heaven saying come up hither John and he saw a door open can you say Amen church the church ages are over here this layout of cnh is ending out in complete apostasy ain't that right amen you know the question was asked uh uh I I think by one of my children or so about um uh why why doesn't the world know about brother Branham today if he had a worldwide Ministry why doesn't the people know I'll tell you why they know there's a lot of people that know about this but now what you're what you're into is complete apostasy gross Darkness gross Darkness where the devil has so hovered over them to where they don't know it's just like it it ain't been too long ago that women got out of dresses and started wearing their pants and and yet we go remember most of us uh I guess when we went to a couple years ago to Golden Corral and and the whole church was there and and so I was standing at the cash register watching every counting everybody to go by and and that little young lady she says wow I've never seen such she said you you you you you you remind me of Bible days I said well thank you but I said really it hadn't been just long ago I said that's the way they all used to dress but what is it and I'm not down in the the girl I'm just saying why people can't remember these things is gross Darkness has come on their intellect has come upon them to where they can't really think anymore people are going insane like crazy amen but God did vindicate this message it's gone seven times around this world can you say Amen that the only people that really see and understand what took place is the elect of God for it wasn't for the world it was for that he left thank you [Music] thank you now he says today we don't try to establish the word of God in the people's hearts we are trying to establish ourselves churches are trying to establish the doctrine of the church in a person's heart we are commanded to establish the word of God Paul said I didn't come to you with enticing words of man that your faith might rest up in the knowledge of man but I come to you in power everybody say power in manifestations of the Holy Ghost that your faith your faith might rest in God Amen your faith is that what not has happened in our day he come in power and in manifestations that are Faith might rest in God why it's time for restoration not partial but complete full restoration brother Brown said man mustn't establish yourself find it amongst he said let God do something for a person and send him out and you find every man trying to impersonate it see they're trying to establish themselves one man has a gift everybody wants that gift one prophesies everybody wants to prophesy one sees Angels everybody wants to see Angels one sees Visions everybody wants to see a vision you understand what I'm saying and it's happening in the message just as well you see one starts Discerning and and then you got a whole bunch of guys trying to discern and and and but they're finding out it's it's you know uh uh one you know uh he had a meeting and discernment was going on you know so this young this young uh uh preacher you know he thought he got so wrapped up in it you know and he went to a little lady and said you got a lesbian spirit and she said I do not what in the world's wrong with you but see everybody wants to do something yeah you know what is it you're trying to establish yourself and not God hello I hope that's okay see every man saying I did this me I mine my denomination it's me see establishing themselves what are we preaching about ourselves or the kingdom of God establish the word of God take out the unbelief and establish the kingdom of God in a man's heart and the kingdom of God cannot be established in a man's heart lest God made that man thus it's not up to us to decide who is who just preach the message establish the word in the people's hearts that's right well I might offend The Sinner what if there's an elect in that crowd and you become so embarrassed about the message afraid you're going to run somebody off and the only thing that's going to grab this elect is this message can you say Amen they want to hear our opinions if it's just opinions they got opinions all over this world if it's just prophecies that's going to get there they got prophecies everywhere that's running rapid preach the message now if you notice God in Christ fulfilled his part of the unconditional Covenant that he made all that God was he poured into Christ to fulfill his part of the Covenant is that right first God revealed himself in Christ the fullness of the godhead dwelt bodily in Christ Jesus but notice again then to bring that fullness of godhead bodily into a people that he might have the preeminence the oversight the leading now everybody say now it's Christ in you fulfilling the second part of the Covenant ain't that right see what is the holy spirit Christ in you the hope of glory then what takes place you become a prisoner of Christ the prophet said see uh uh yeah I believe it's Philippians 2 and 13. for it is God everybody say it is God which worketh in you both to Will and to do of his good pleasure ain't that right see when God gets you to be his prisoner then you can't do nothing the prophet said but what the spirit says do ain't that right at one time Paul the Apostle had high Ambitions and and with that he was taught by a great intellectual Man game and and Paul was studying to be a great priest a rabbi he he had real just he was very ambitious and high high dreams and intellectually Paul was the the greatest uh one of the great men in in the nation with great Authority the prophet said but notice but he had to sacrifice every bit of it to become part of the word to express Jesus Christ say that again he had to sacrifice every bit of his Ambitions his dreams his goals because it didn't line up with the word of God he sacrificed every bit to become part of the word to express Jesus Christ I I want to just say this because uh uh you know it really bothers me when when I hear ministers putting the message people down as though you know they're stuck up as though you know uh uh they're ignorant dumb and and I've heard it quite a bit and it really just it gets my Christian feathers ruffed uh because I don't think you have to belittle people in the message to make you look good you don't have to I don't think no you know I'm I'm speaking to the Core group of message Believers but they're not stuck up they're a humble group of people that ain't gullible we used to be gullible in the mess in in Pentecost if someone shook a leg we followed [Music] it's if someone you know spit right we followed if someone had a dream we sucked it in we were gullible people but we're not gullible people this message took the VA the the vulnerability out this message took the gullibility out we don't follow just anybody can you say Amen the Bible says prove them prove them brother Brian said give them a word test ain't that right so if you don't see that people jumping high when you say to jump high it's not because they don't like you and it's not because they're they're stuck up and and all that they just want to see what the fruit of this thing is where is it going to lead me when I jump can you say Amen you see we've had to sacrifice every bit of us to come into this message and you say Amen if a man has not sacrificed every bit no wonder he doesn't see it can't really conjoin with the message people even though they say well I message the prophet and all this stuff if he can't sacrifice his own Pentecostal ideas his own Baptist ways his own Apostolic or whatever ways to really sacrifice it all to become part of the word he'll never be able to become part yes sir that's good he had to become part of the word to express Jesus Christ brother Brahman said see Paul was such a prisoner that he had a notion to go over to some place some brethren and called him had called him but he was forbidden by the spirit to do his own will if people have spiritual can pick that up he was forbidden to do his own will ain't that right see the spirit forbid me why he was a prisoner to Christ see there's another time that Paul knew that he had the power to cast The Devil out of that fortune teller amen she followed him around for for days and and and Paul never done nothing he allowed her to do what she was doing and and say what she was saying and all of that and yet he knew it was it was of the devil amen see and and so Paul did not question as to whether he had the power he knew that he had the power ain't that right but he waited everybody say he waited he waited till the spirit gave him permission to cast that thing out ain't that right see the power is in the church but it doesn't work on our own timing it doesn't work just because we say it works and we believe it works we we we believe that we have the power of God we believe that the holy spirit is working in us we believe Amen in the ministry of angels that they're with us all the time but it doesn't happen instantly Miracles don't happen instantly we don't just that we don't operate it on our own we are now becoming prisoners to the word and you have to have to be a believer of the word you have to be a faith believer in the word to believe all of God's word in order to be a prisoner because your sacrifice and your own notion you're sacrificing your own Ministry your sacrifice and your own ideas your own thoughts and becoming a prisoner and you say man so he's going to have full preeminence in the church you believe it young people who's going to have full preeminence and young people he's going to have full and preeminence in the preacher he's going to have full preeminence in the deacons he's going to have full preeminence in the musician he's going to have full preeminence in everybody that belongs in his church because it's all right say you'll never know the power of God until you become a prisoner to Christ [Music] we don't have to try to make things happen it will happen in God's timing can you say that with me it will happen in God's timing do you believe it it will happen in God's timing just wait on him just wait see you just have to be yielded to him the prophet said Moses had to lose his intellectuals had to be a prisoner in order to find Christ brother Bram says when God got all the world beat out of him and all of his mighty man that he was and standing in the presence of that Pillar of Fire that day he found just he was found just speechless he didn't have he didn't he couldn't even talk he said see God had a prisoner then you won't try after your own searching see then God had to undo this man endow him with power enough that he could go down there and he said Lord I told Pharaoh what you said and he wouldn't do it and he says then God says take this Rod then and see thy rod see God speaking that's God's word go out there and point it towards the east and call for flies and flies come into creation because everybody say because he had a prisoner that Pharaoh couldn't pay off with nothing nobody else could turn him no way he was a complete prisoner in the chains of God's word bound only bound up only everybody say only to thus saith the Lord see if God can get his prisoners like that that's when he can express the preeminances you see he's got the man or the person so that he knows nothing but Christ and Christ is the message do you believe that now you know people may think an old-fashioned to be led by the spirit but that's the kind that his church has made up that's what makes up the Church of the Living God is a people that can be led they that are sons of God are led by the spirit of God ain't that right so the Holy Spirit has always been God's agent what what else you know how else can the world be created amen God spoke it and the Holy Spirit began to brood over the Earth ain't that right to make love and things began to appear but not only God spoke his word concerning the earth and the universe he also spoke a word concerning his bride his church and the church is his body as as the prophet said it we know the quote uh uh you know she is bone of his bone life in his life flesh of his flesh power of his power she is him ain't that right see so the bride is the Church of the Living God and those whose names were written in the Lamb's Book of Life are the ones who make up this bride and everyone that is in the bride of Christ he was is in God's thinking ain't that right as we talked about that he what he thought of you is predestinated is predestinated amen uh uh what he predestinated you to be and as we said his thoughts are Eternal and they are real so what he allowed you to be is only temporary ain't that right it's only temporary so there are things about us that must change because they are not Eternal only what was in his thinking is eternal and will remain see so the world in its current condition is not going to remain our body is not going to remain the way it is now aren't you glad for that corruption is not going to remain our sicknesses is not going to remain our failures are not going to remain one of these days you're going to see it for the last time one of these days you're going to see yourself the way you are right now for the last time you believe it I believe it's any day now ain't that right for God's Eternal thoughts shall reveal uh prevail so what is what is the word of God it's not a Creed or Dogma as we know it's not a theology it's not your thinking the word of God is God's thoughts expressed ain't that right so then to be an expression of God's thinking you must become the word everybody say I must become the word amen you know we talked about it God is preparing his people you've got to be the prophet said a real word bride a real word bride brother Branham and speaking of the city now prepared he says the Heavenly beings who have prepared her watch breathlessly for she glistens and shines with the glory that is unearthly every facet of her beauty tells a story of Amazing Grace and Jesus love she is a prepared City for a prepared people she only awaits she awaits only for her inhabitants and soon they will thrown her streets with joy so can you become the word if you're in his thinking amen amen you can become every bit of the word why because brother Branham said it's through his holy blood that we have access to life and our sexual blood is dismissed don't cry over your Hang-Ups look at what you are becoming the word God gave you the baptism of the Holy Ghost showing that he's approved your faith showing that he your confession your repentance was true ain't that right and at that time he dismissed your sexual blood so we have the blood of Jesus Christ that stands for an atonement make an atonement for our sins brother Brandon says Jesus the word took my place he become me that a sinner see that I might become him the word let me hold true to it not the church the word oh that spiritual union of Christ and his church now when the flesh is becoming the word and the word is becoming flesh manifested and Vindicated just what the Bible said would happen in this day it's happening day by day why it's accumulating so fast out there in those deserts and things taking place that I couldn't even keep up with it we're nearing the coming of Jesus to be United with his church where the word becomes the word becomes the word [Applause] written Epistles read a known of all men this Bible's already spoke of you you can become the word you love him see something in you is calling for it David described it as the Deep calling unto the Deep it calls to live amen it calls to do right ain't that right notice I believe it's in um well I can't I can't remember the the certain things that are to be then God will call somebody on the platform or the pulpit that will preach the absolute truth why see it shows you then if you're a real child of God you begin to cry out God take it away from me circumcise me from this take these things away from me why it's needed everybody say it's needed for your heavenly home that you're going to where he's gone on to prepare another place it was God's purpose to bring forth a people like unto himself that would be a word bride she was chosen before the foundation of the world in him she was foreknown and beloved before she was ever brought forth during these ages upon the Earth she was Redeemed by his blood and can never come into condemnation she could never be in the Judgment because sin cannot everybody say it cannot be imputed unto her exactly right so this is the age to bring back the word this is the age to bring back the word amen you love him give me just another five minutes Hebrews 12 25 see that you refuse him not you realize this is prophetic of this age see that you refuse him not let's speaketh for if they escape not who refused him that spake on Earth how much more shall we not escape from him that speaketh from heaven whose voice then shook the Earth but now he has promised saying yet once more I shake not the Earth only but also the heaven him and this word yet once more signified the removing now this ought to excite us the removing of those things that are shaken as the things that are made that those things which cannot be shaken May remain wherefore we receive a kingdom which cannot be moved let us have Grace whereby we may serve God acceptably with reverence and godly fear ain't that right so everything that can be shaken will be shaken and we'll be done away with but everything that cannot be shaken will remain why why is that happening in this state because it's time for the word to come it's time for a word bride to come it's time for a word Kingdom to come it's time for a word Eden to come back it's time that everything that God had in the beginning by his word would be restored back and it'll take the word to restore you do you believe it for heaven and Earth shall pass away but my word shall never pass away let God's word be true in every man a lie ain't that right notice Isaiah 40 and 6 All Flesh is grass and all the goodness thereof is as the flower of the field the grass withereth the flower fadeth because the spirit of the Lord bloweth upon it ain't that amazing the spirit of the Lord bleweth upon it surely the grass is people the grass withereth the flower fadeth but the word of the Lord of our the word of our God shall stand forever so what's going to remain the word shall remain that which remain cannot be shaken shall remain and what is it the word they which are alive and remain shall be caught up what is it it's a word people that are still standing through all the shake and through all the deception through everything that they go through the word will remain the trials are only to take that which is temporal away from you to take the doubt away from you to take the criticism away from you to take the unbelief away everything that is not of God to take it away from you that you may remain as the word [Music] you believe it it was in this day that a prophet stood and said House of hell give way to the name of Jesus that which can be shaken will be done away with and the prophet said all the creaking and the popping and the rocks are rolling and the bars have fallen why because that which can be shaken will be shaken are you with me now the other things that have held Japan is shaking and people running and screaming delivered and screaming at the top of their voice and all all was delivered can you say Amen is this all right notice the prophet said they'll say Odyssey in church ages the grandest of all Church ages because it's the ending of time and the blending of Eternity you're standing at the blending what's making it happen your faith in all of God's word your faith in all of God's word we flew to New Zealand a few years back and we actually got to a place somewhere in the air that you can look out one window and it was all bright you can look it out the other window it was all dark we were right there church if you could only see where you're at darkness is here it's gross Darkness and there's a people there that girl's Darkness has covered them but if you look the fruits was bright and what got you there is God is bringing us over now there's people that cannot come over but you're coming and you're stepping in more into eternity one by one day by day Moment by moment do you believe it the transformation is actually taking place it's brought you to a place that you can see both dark and Light at the same time can you say Amen you love him what is it it's the ending of worldly kingdoms and the ushering end of Eternal Kingdom it's the ending of Satan's Eden and the restoration of God's Eden so we can understand as to why the change is happening we can understand why the turmoil and all these things are happening in the in the earth it's not to our detriment uh the laws that are being passed is not to our detriment the chaos that is happening is not to your detriment the pressure that you're feeling is not to your detriment can you say Amen but rather for our benefit because corruption is changing from to incorruption uncleanliness is changing to Holiness the Earthly things are changing to Heavenly things the carnal mind is being changed to the mind of Christ [Music] why the trumpet of Jubilee has sounded do you believe it do you believe that this message is the trumpet of Jubilee it's the trumpet of Jubilee and if you can believe it you can walk away and be free and everything that has been been binding you is only to be shaken by The Voice be shaken by The Voice to where you can walk away free and be transformed by the renewing of your mind oh do you love him the Prophet Daniel said in every one that shall be found written in the book shall be delivered can you say Amen we all know the the prophecy of ezekiel's dry bones their valley of dry bones Ezekiel 37 1-10 I won't read it but but you know the prophet gave the stages Lutheran age and Wesley and Pentecostal but it would be in this time that God would Breathe God would Breathe the breath of life and that the the winds yes they're blowing that which can wither they're blowing that which can fade that wind of God is blowing but upon the people of God that elect its breathing Breath of Life into them it's quickening I thank God for the ministry of the prophet of this age I thank God that God has allowed us to hear the voice amen and not us be shaken but everything about us that has been temporary is now being shaken away from us and we can lift up holy hands we can lift amen of holy hands and worship and there's no doubt in our heart it's been shaken away it's been removed amen the traditions of man that has held us have been removed amen everything is being removed and we're being restored back to a word bride what he thought in his mind by the ministry of a prophet in this age do you love him it's the word bride living again nothing nothing nothing has been able to make the word live amen the prophet said see he died so he could come himself into that word he is the quickening life that makes that word live again that was his purpose of dying that he could still project himself through his church and make every word through every age at just exactly the way it's supposed to act can you say Amen in our natural birth we were just like everyone else sinful men and women and and many of us and and I'm going to close but many of us were caught in the snare of religion the and the Harlot her daughters prostitute daughters but it's the grace of God that we've gotten out of it you you look at Revelations the 13th chapter the third verse through fourth it says I saw one of his heads as it were wounded to death and his deadly wound was healed and all everybody say all the world wandered after the Beast and they worshiped the dragon which gave power unto the Beast and they worshiped the Beast saying who is likened to the Beast not who is likened to the Lord Our God but who is likened to the Beast who is able to make war with him you realize that we should have been in that number all the world we should have been one of them that wanders after the beast but we're not Revelations 13 8 tells us who this is that worships the beasts all that dwell upon the Earth shall worship Him whose names are not written in the Book of Life of the lamb slain from the foundation of the world those whose names are not written in that Lamb's Book of Life One Day somehow someway are going to follow and worship the Beast they've already taken on his name can you say man but it's the grace of God that we're not caught in that system yeah and you say Amen and God determined to deliver us ain't that right if the musicians will come Revelations 18 3 all nations All Nations think of it all nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her fornication and the kings of the Earth have committed fornication with her and the merchants of the Earth are waxed Rich through the abundance of her Delicacies and I heard another voice from Heaven this is the voice this is the voice that Paul spoke of that said I'll shake the heavens and earth with this voice I heard another voice from Heaven come out saying come out of her my people that you be not partaker of her sin that you will not worship her you will not give any uh adoration to her you will not be caught up in her in the cages of her no no no no no be free from her can you say Amen that you receive not of her plagues and how did we come out behold I will sin unto you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the Dreadful great and Dreadful day of the Lord and He Shall chop you out he shall Hew you out you couldn't come out without a prophet thank God for ministers that still preach this message thank God for people that still believe the message we are not our own we have been bought with a price and it is he that hath made us and not we ourselves we are his people and the Sheep of his pastures [Music] aren't you glad for it can you lift your hands and just Worship the Lord father we're so thankful Lord we are a

you're a seed of God an attribute a Son of God then the word of God is sown in you and then when you hear the word of God my sheep hear my voice a stranger they will not follow you get it then every seed comes forth after its own kind how did God bring Christ here upon the Earth by Prophets how does God bring you the bride upon the Earth by prophet how was Christ identified as being the word by a prophet how are you identified as the word bride by prophet we come looking like everybody else similarity but God knew we were a bride God knew we were word material God knew he had called us for it he had already ordained us for it we were the names written in the Lamb's Book of Life he just had to identify us now he said a prophet and out of that prophet's message here comes a bride rising up hallelujah hallelujah now we're not identified as church members churchgoers we are identified with him as the word bride and the prophet would stand on the earth and say now you are Miss Jesus Christ can you say man not misdenomination not miss Pentecost not miss Baptist but miss Jesus Christ we happy and I identified by the message of the hour he has pointed the people to a word-born bride and he is pointing this bride to Jesus Christ can you say man aren't you glad for it oh can we stand and give God the glory and the praise I thank God Hallelujah oh blessed be the name of the Lord blessed be
