well I'm glad to be serving the lord to know him in a special way and to love him and I'm so glad he loved me but I am also glad that I can love him and I know that we all seek to just to love him more and more and that's just my cry every day to him is just I want to love him and it's certainly good to be back amen and um I Heard just wonderful uh reports about the services and appreciate um uh brother Amos and brother Josiah for filling in and uh ministering again uh but we appreciate that and and just appreciate the love that you have all have for the message of the hour and um I believe God is doing something great in here in Faith Tabernacle and um um you know we we always you know you you always go through your bumps and your things that Satan's all fighting us over uh don't matter how great how small but you know what when we come together like this and just lifting up holy hands and singing songs unto him and amening the word and I tell you what it just shows that Satan don't know what to do with you amen he's trying every which way he can to destroy the body of Christ to destroy the Believers and uh you know I think I think he will be glad when we're gone amen I just think he's going to be glad when we're gone then he gets to have his way with this Earth yes to have his do what all the evils that he wants to do but as long as your little light is flickering he can't touch you he's limited he's it's it's off limits you know what I mean and and you know you're the people that God says you're the apple of my eye now you just think of that you're the apple of his eye so when he touches you when the devil touches you and he tries to God takes that as a personal insult you know and so I uh I do believe that uh they're they're all hell is going to break loose when we're gone but that's okay uh let it let it be uh we'll be with our bridegroom amen and so um we're really just honored to have uh uh my nephew um brother Josh and sister Loretta amen and that little baby of theirs or I say little baby he's growing up now Ethan and and you don't like me just too much yet but we're going to make friends steal I just got to give him a bunch of candy or something and but uh so glad to have them and we want brother Josh just to preach what the lord has laid upon his heart and uh we're needing we're needing Ministry out on the field you know and and we're we're needing men of God that preach this message believe this message and not adding stuff to it but just preaching it and you know we got to thinking about that I don't know if y'all's heard but it's it's it's there but they voted brother Wayne Lawson and his Pastor in Ohio and so he is now the the official pastor and he called me you know before the meeting he said now I got to go back and you know he's I can't tell you why you know and and until it's over and and uh so he told me not you know after the meeting he said they're going to be voting me in and I just sit and cried you know I thought I'm losing a I'm losing a real buddy right there and and I thought well why does all these churches going to do if he's going to just be stuck at one Church you know and uh it's kind of being a little selfish but uh uh uh we're really just appreciate brother Wayne's Ministry he's been a help to the bride all around the world and uh but you know what uh I believe God's raising up these young men to carry the gospel and I thought you know what I'm kind of like what brother Brown said we need a rally around these young men and we got brother Andrew a young man a point there goes that's where he usually sets but he's he's about the only young man I I if I can say it that way just with the real power packed uh Ministry that is out there full time and we need to Rally around that gift and pretend affected and and just and and you say well how are we going to lift up a man no that's not it we need to pray for him and God just protects them keeps them and keeps them straight can you say amen and uh so we want to just all of us do our part for the gospel of Christ amen so I'm glad that God's raising up brother Josh to preach the gospel I I'm glad for the young men here at our church uh that God's raising up to preach and uh as I believe as long as this message is is here the bride is here there's going to be there's going to be young people rising up and carrying this this message can you say man and you know I was riding in the car the other day now Levi all my boys have tried to preach you know at home and but he he he carries you know he preaches for an hour or more you know and and he does like audiences you know and and so he'll he'll sometimes you know open the door word said his Pulpit right down in the middle of the living room where we're all setting and uh said you know I needed a glass of water and and he says you know I need someone to sing to call me out and so we we have sometimes we'll have our little service and he preaches but the other day he said Dad I just believe God's called me to pass or preach the gospel and I said well that's good and he says what do you think I'm going to be a pastor I said I don't know you know but you know I guess as long as as God uh is is God the time tarries we got young people it's rising up going to preach the gospel going to carry be song leaders be whatever God wants him to be and I just want to be a part of it amen so God bless you and let's just sing this song turn it over to Jesus amen new song it's an easy one uh I think I've sung it here before turn it over

it's not too fun traveling by yourself you know I always say whenever you go new places and you have your wife if there's nobody else to talk to you can always talk to your wife so we appreciate her going with me because I've been new places by myself and that ain't too that ain't too very fun there's nobody to talk to but so I appreciate my wife been with me my my little boy Ethan he's growing up fast it's so it's good to be here this evening now I wasn't expecting on preaching and I'm sure y'all weren't expecting on me preaching but I I know everything works out according to his will amen I speak a name of Jesus over you in your hurting in your sorrow I will ask my God to move I speak the name cause it's all that I can do in desperation I'll see Kevin and pray this for you I pray for

to receive What the Lord Has for us tonight amen if you have your Bibles let's turn to Ephesians 6 and 10. amen it's an honor to be ministering this evening always an honor and a privilege to minister the gospel amen I pray something can be said this evening that can be a blessing before we read the scriptures can we bow our heads dear gracious heavenly father and Lord you've been so good to us God Lord he gave us a desire Lord to come into your house and into your presence Lord and God as we're in worship you this evening father and we've created an atmosphere I ask the Lord that you would come and meet the needs Lord I ask that you and Lord speak to these lips of clay As I Lay myself aside Lord you know the needs that are in the building father I ask that you would meet him Lord May there be be a willing heart to receive what you have for him tonight we ask these things in your precious name amen Ephesians 6 and 10. finally my brethren be strong in the Lord and in the power of His might put on the whole armor of God that ye may be able to stand against The Wiles of the devil for be wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against powers against rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places wherefore take unto you the whole armor of God that ye may be able to withstand on the evil day having done all to stand amen you may be seated amen if I had a simple subject tonight it would be anointed to meet the challenge and this just stood out to me how how the Ephesians here this the scripture was talking how there's a lot that's coming against us we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against Powers against rulers of Darkness against spiritual wickedness so there's a lot that's coming against the bride against the church and I believe we're living in a day where it's an all-out attack on the word on God on the bride the devil is challenging everything that is right everything that the word stands for the devil's coming against him you can take something simple like traditional marriage and the devil is even taking that the guy the Lord God set that in order in the very first book you know as man and woman though it's going to come together and so the devil is taking something simple like that and twisting it up Josiah was telling us earlier that there was a preacher that was saying that that God was a queer you know something simple all that we will look and say wow that's just insane but the devil is taking the truth or taking the simple values of Believers and twisting it up and there's the worlds falling for it they're falling right into the web and it's getting more wicked and more wicked but I believe right in the midst of the chaos right in the midst of the uh the confusion there's somebody that's not in confusion but is standing upon Waters right and we see throughout the Bible throughout the church ages that the devil's number one's Focus has always been the word it's always been the word brother Branham says in the beginning when he came against uh in the garden he says he didn't attack Eve he attacked the word then whenever he attacked the word and her belief or her her faith in the word started to get beat down and so now we understand why the devil's constantly fighting against the message constantly fighting against their faith because once he gets your faith down right there you're defeated without faith we can't believe in the promises without faith we can't believe that God can still heal but with faith we can stand upon what is right brother Brandon would say we know we've got we there's counterfeits everywhere that's right it's a battle you've got to know your enemy and you've got to know your armor your armor is the word and your enemy is something that a reason against it oh my anything that's reasoning against the word is the enemy and I believe we can say Amen to that anything that's coming against us the message is the enemy but anything that stands for this message is worth standing for it's worth standing behind a pastor it's worth standing behind behind a Ministry behind a church that is standing for the truth amen you see brother Branham says the devil is trying to unite man under head knowledge and he promises this is worth the authority is but brother Branham says that's a big lie The Authority only comes by the word and I believe that we're standing upon on the word but the Brandon would say that the devil is building a hybrid church with hybrid members hybrid by knowledge instead of the word oh my hybrid it's a knockoff there's no genuine to it but I believe there's a genuine bride that's standing under the genuine word brother Branham says that the Lucifer is trying to break the unity between God and man which is the headship is trying to break the headship between God and man how is he doing it by reasoning the word of God oh my but the challenge has been made but I believe somebody is going to meet the challenge brother Branham would save the enemy speaks today the enemy tries to say that the days of Miracles has passed there's no such thing as the baptism of the Holy Ghost this is only emotion it's only a workup so the enemy is challenged and his challenge must he didn't say maybe so not hope so but the challenge must be met he says the only way we can meet the challenge when the denominations are calling people away and putting them in organizations and let them women cut their hair and wear makeup men live all kinds of lives lives our trustees and deacons and pastors and churches because they got some PhD or lld and that's the requirement Jesus never did require a man to have that Jesus requirement was wait in the city of Jerusalem until you're endued with power from one High Venue or a witness to me that meets his challenge oh I like how he says that you're a witness to me not to some organization not to some denomination but you're a witness to me Christ the world is always going to have a witness for the Branham says God always has a witness on Earth it was David it was shamgar it was Samson but in this day it's not just one body or one person but it's a multi-member body that is standing against the tide standing against the challenge when the devil says God can't heal somebody stands up and says God Can Heal Me When God Devil's hands God don't fill with the Holy Ghost there's a young person that says I've been filled with the Holy Ghost I'm equipped to meet the challenge of the day oh my reminds me of the story brother Branham was talking to a man I believe it was a preacher and the preacher asked him and he says if you bet how have you been filled with the Holy Ghost but the Branham says yes sir I was filled with the Holy Ghost he says my that's wonderful he says yep I was baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and I got the Holy Ghost and the man stopped and he says wait you don't get the Holy Ghost that way but the Branham looks at him and says it's too late I done did it so the devil can come and say that God don't move anymore it's too late we're still experiencing the power of Pentecost we're experiencing the power that is inside of this a message oh my the devil don't got enough to stop this bride how come because heavens and earth may pass away but this word this message will never fail oh we're standing upon shopping that has enough to meet the challenge oh my what's that mean to meet the challenge you're equipped with enough you've got the capability to stand against the challengers oh my Warner standing in our own ability we're not standing in our own strengths but we're standing with an anointing so the enemy is challenged and the enemy's challenge must be met you see he's challenging the word because once we throw away the word we throw away our resources and I believe the only way we can accept the word and believe the word is through the Holy Ghost oh my brother Branham says what meets the challenge is to be endued with power from on high oh my soul that's what meets The Challenge the Bible says in John 17 and 15. I pray not that thou shouldest take them out of the world but thou should keep a stem from Evil oh Marshall with the sin nature where Noah is going to go after evil there's no way to accept the truth when we up a nature of alive there's no way we can accept what's right when the Nature's on the inside is craving Rogue but but Jesus says don't take them off the earth I need some witnesses don't take them off but I want them to be right in the middle of the most evil age right in the middle of the most wicked age and you're going to keep them there's going to be an anointing that's going to stand against the tide that's going to stand against the odds when this one's falling away when that one's backsliding then this one's a disgrace there's somebody on Earth that's meeting the challenge we're anointed they're staying against the tide oh you may say brother Josh you don't know what I'm going through I don't care what you're going through there's an annoying thing that's on your life that can keep you through every trial and through every circumstance you see without the Holy Ghost there's no power to enforce the word you notice how the Bible puts it be strong in the power of His might which is the Holy Ghost then the next verse says put on the whole armor of God which is the word of God which is the message I believe but in order to put on the whole armor of God you have to be strong in his might oh so you can't take the word and make a live without his might without the Holy Ghost that's where many people hail they come to church they listen to the message they get ahead knowledge but there's no authority to make the word live there's no authority to produce what is on the inside you know the Bible the Bible says the word is the seed remember the parable and the yeah and Luke 8 the shoulder went out and sowed the seed the Bible says of Hell by the wayside of Hell by the thorns and this thistles and what stood out to me the Bible says it fell by The Rock and the Bible says it started to grow up it started to bring forth the life but there was no moisture to water it oh my source started to die even though the potential was there help the water without the moisture and started to fall away and brother Branham says the moisture is the type of the Holy Ghost without the Holy Ghost the word has no authority to produce itself oh but with the Holy Ghost there's nothing in laodicea that can keep the word from coming to pass oh my you're seeing an apple seed has the potential of every Apple that was going to come forth but inside of the seed is just the potential no power to enforce it oh so you got to plant the seed in some ground and let them for sure let the water start to water that seed and then that then that quick and something on the inside to enforce the potential oh then it goes from potential to manifestation oh man right now the pride it has potentials on the inside to be an overcomer to be the the march of a lush the pornography but we needed something to bring that for potential it's a manifestation and that was the Holy Ghost that it forced the seed to come to life Oh Maya now we're not a potential bride we're not a potential Overcomer but we're manifesting the potential of the seed God's not coming after a potential Overcomer he's not coming after a potential bride but he that overcometh will share with me in my throat there's an overcomer on her that's not a potential but it's a manifesting the power of the Living God oh my you're part of that Pride that's a manifesting the power of the Living God oh my second Corinthians three and six who also has made us able Ministers of the New Testament not of the letter but of the spirit for the letter killeth but the spirit giveth life so the word has no Authority in your life without the water oh come on somebody oh the word has no Authority in your life without the Holy Ghost brother Brandon would say you're not even off first base we'll stop the Holy Ghost so we have to have the Holy Ghost to bring the seed from potential to manifestation and that's what meets the challenge you look at John 14 and 15. if you love me keep my Commandments and I will pray the father and he shall give you another comforter that he may abide with you forever so the anointing that's going to fall in your life ain't going to leave you tomorrow ain't going to leave you the next day but it's going to abide take a precedence oh mind's not moving out but he's going to abide forever and that distract me the other day if she'll love me keep my commandments so I believe that's talking about the seed he's placing a part of his love for himself that's what's going to draw you the Bible says no man cometh to me unless the father first draws him that's the predestinated seed I may have said it before but I don't believe predestination is a crutch where you see I'm predestinated so I can do this I can live way however I want that's not the way predestination works but what's the Bible say the wages of sin is death so that's far away from God but the gift of God is eternal life so what's predestination it draws you to the gift which is the Holy Ghost oh Hallelujah but if you love me keep my Commandments and I believe he knew it was going to be impossible to keep the word but then he says I'm going to send you a comforter I'm going to send an anointing I'm going to send the Holy Ghost so that the potential the love that is on the inside can start to manifest itself oh man I believe that the anointing can fall in every life in every home and every marriage on the job site where you're manifesting the love of God you're manifesting what the Lord's saying before the foundation of the world it's an anointing that gives you an authority to make the world live and I believe once the anointing comes upon a life we become bold we come bold with the promises of God we're not wishy-washy we're not blown away by every wound of Doctrine but something has anchored only inside that I become bored with the promises of God for the Branham says when something is revealed you become Fearless oh you become Fearless you're no longer worried about what the naysayers are saying oh they may say that this message is post that God don't fill with the Holy Ghost but I don't care what they're saying it's been revealed to me the potential that is on the inside has been revealed oh hallelujah it's been revealed and I've proven to the world that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever there's something about the anointing you look at acts 4 and 12. neither is there salvation in any other name for there was none other name under Heaven given among men whereby we must be saved and when they saw the boldness of Peter and John perceived that they were unlearned and ignorant men they marveled and took knowledge of them that they had been with Jesus they said that what they're producing oh my their manifestation ain't a part of them this ain't the men we remember these ain't the ones that that we remember them running up in the upper room they were scared because they were going to be you're going to be killed and they were being persecuted what made the difference and the only conclusion they could come up with was they had been with Jesus they had been with Jesus the anointing makes the difference no longer were they scared but they were standing up against the challenge it was the scribes and the Pharisees that was challenging Christ there was challenging Christianity and they was running from The Challenge but once the anointing Came Upon them there was no longer running but they had enough to meet it they had enough to say there's no other salvation but in Jesus Christ and they looked to send my whatever they got is the genuine thing whatever they caught changed them oh my brother Brandon must say let's notice Pentecost how they acted and see how they were quickened by this quickening power they were talking about on the day of Pentecost they were all waiting up there in themselves they were afraid so before the anointing they were afraid the Jews just what they were going to do so they got scared but what happened when this quick getting power fell from heaven there was a bravery that shed upon them there was a bravery that set upon them there was something in understanding where they wasn't too sure of it a few hours ago they knew he had died they knew he had risen they had talked to him on the way but was that for them or was it just for Jesus himself oh my but then they found the reality of it this anointing ain't Just for Jesus but it's for me you must say does God still fill with the Holy Ghost taste and see that the Lord is good this ain't just for the prophet just this this ain't just for the pastor or for the preacher but it's for everyone that's Gotta Love it's for everyone that has a desire on the inside this anointing is for you oh my is the quickening power the anointing that makes the difference you see what's separated David from his brothers they was from the same tribe they was from the same Heritage they was from the same parents they were brothers they were siblings but what made the difference the anointing how come there was I there I believe there were seven brothers I believe they were all hiding in the capes they was afraid to stand up against Goliath but then there was the youngest the one that didn't have no capabilities he didn't have no muscles he was a strong and stature but there was one thing that he had he had a response to the anointing oh there was something responding to the anointing we know how the story goes the God told Samuel the prophet to go anoint the king to choose somebody to be raised up in a position of authority oh man I believe that God sent the prophet in this day to anoint somebody for a position of authority we're not meant to serve we're meant to Reign you're not meant to be serving sin and to serve addictions and to serve the things of the world you're meant to Reign you're meant to Reign Over every Spirit you're meant to Reign Over everything the Lego Russia has oh you've got enough to meet it you've got enough to meet the challenge oh my soul so the prophet comes to Jesse's house and Jesse's own father didn't think the boy had What it Took he didn't think he had What it Took but the anointing had it the anointing had what David lacked oh my and the anointing hash what the pride lacks the anointing has what the world lacks it's their power to enforce the words oh my so he comes up before the before the eldest brother it says my strongest stature this has got to be the one that the Lord chooses and the Lord says no I've refused him I don't look on the outwards I don't look at the stature but I look at the heart I'll look at what's on the inside I look at the love I looked at what I put before the foundation of the world oh my if you don't got a seat there's nothing to be quickened the anointing the Bible says the rain falls on the jest and the unjust so if there's an apple seed sitting right here and there's a pear tree sitting right here the same rain is going to fall on both seats but the pair has nothing to bring forth apples all in the serpent seat has nothing to bring forth the Life of Christ but you're privileged your priv that's God placed a part of himself before the foundation of the world so that there can be something respond to the anointing oh come on somebody there's something that's responding to the anointing because you look at David that he with the the prophet Samuel went throughout the brothers and he said no this time put one and he looked at Jesse he says is there any other brothers is there any other sons and he says well there's one more but he's a nobody he he's ready he's not strong in stature but the prophet says that we're not going to sit till he gets here so go fetch him and there was somebody that went that's called David's name and so in order for David to be anointed he had to respond come on somebody that I'm sure there was a messenger that started calling out David hey David David somebody wants to talk to you and he would stop and he say me are you sure he's not talking about my brothers now is your name David yes my name is David he could call him by name oh there was something that was a deep calleth through the deep and there was something on the inside that started to respond to the tugging and as he was responding he was being anointed and as you respond to the tug of the seed there can be an anointing that can fall in your life and that can bring the life on the outside that can bring their seed to life and that it can manifest itself and so David would respond to the call and as he would respond to the call that the prophet would come up before him said this is the one the Lord chose and when I love about it he dumped he grabbed the anointing oil and dump it all on David he didn't spare any he didn't live not for another day he didn't leave none for another Age come on somebody or what was in God he poured into Christ and what was in Christ he pours out on the church they're in another day coming there ain't another Pride coming this is it he poured himself upon the bride so that you can have enough to meet the challenge oh Hallelujah so the Holy Ghost gives the ability to recognize what your true potential is it gives you the ability to notice what is in your midst oh my soul without remember without the Holy Ghost you can't make the word live hope this is okay without the Holy Ghost you can't recognize the word you look at First Corinthians 12 and 3 wherefore I gives you to understand that no man speaketh by the spirit of God College calleth Jesus a curse that no man can say that Jesus is the Lord but by the anointing so the only way you can notice notice the anointed is by the anointing come on somebody you can't recognize that this message is the truth without the anointing but with the anointing with the Holy Ghost it will lead you to the anointed oh my brother Brandon would say I tell you just as that eagle recognize the voice so does a real born-again Christian recognize the voice of God speaking through the word when they see it anointed and Vindicated the anointing always leads you to the anointed oh my that's why I believe brother Brandon even says it if you've got the real genuine Holy Ghost it will lead you to the message that's what he said if you've got the Holy Ghost the anointing it will lead you to the anointing you look at Luke 2 and 25 and behold there was a man in Jerusalem whose name was Simeon a left how it identifies him because there was the many men in Jerusalem but there was only one that was going to be anointed oh come on I'm feeling good this evening there's many church members out here there's many of those billions of people on Earth but there's only one group that's Anointed with the anointing to see the anointed oh my there was a many there was many scribes there was many many Pharisees there was many preachers but there was only one guy that was called to save the anointed oh Hallelujah there was a man of Jerusalem whose name was Simeon and the same man was just and about waiting for the consolation of Israel and the Holy Ghost was upon him and it was revealed unto him by the anointing by the holy ghost that he should not see death before he had seen the anointed oh come on somebody and before he had seen the Lord's Christ I like how it puts it the Lord's Christ there's many anointed there's so many there's this many Christ and false prophets that's got a genuine anointing brother Branham says uh uh I can't remember the sermon right now anointed once at the end time he says it's a genuine anointing but the only way to separate the two is by the word and so here it is they're waiting for the Christ and there come a time well I'll read the next verse and he came by the spirit into the temple when the parents brought the Child Jesus to do for him after the customs of the law they took him up in his arms and blessed God and said Lord now let us thy servant depart in peace according to Thy word from mine eyes have seen thy salvation I'm brother Branham must say that there was thousands of people in Palestine I believe that's where it was he says there are thousands of people hundreds of mamas with babies but what made the difference he says he was being led by the spirit he was being led by the anointing to the anointed and there was the many scribes though I'm sure would walk right by Jesus and never paid him a bit of attention walks right by Mary and Joseph and didn't pay them attention but there was an old man that recognized the anointed oh man there's many people that has turned away this message and said no he was a false prophet they might not recognize it but I recognize what is in our midst it's the anointed word Jesus Christ and it's the anointing on the inside that is responding recognizing the anointed oh Hallelujah here's the quote I was talking about brother Branham says no matter how religious you are how many churches you belong to how many books your name is on if that genuine Holy Ghost is in you which is the word manifest you'll see the message and the hour you can't help but say it because the same anointing that anointed the word is anointing your life oh my the same anointing the simple word is anointing a vessel to receive the word come know somebody you're not responding in your own ability but the same anointing that anointed the word and shall let there be light was the same anointing thing that went with the word to make it come to pass oh Hallelujah and that same anointing is then a bride that is taking a hold of this message and making it come to life this message ain't just to stay on the tapes ain't the same on the iPads but it's coming inside of a multi-member bride and making the word live and show it to the world that God's not defeated God's not bad but there's a pride with the Life of Christ meeting the challenge oh my we've got enough to meet the challenge the anointing recognizes the anointing look at Matthew 12 and 49 but he answered and said unto them and evil and adulteration seeketh after a sign that struck me he didn't say the elect is seeking after a sign they found who they were looking for oh they found it but it was the adulterous generation the evil generation was constantly looking for something to come I'm preaching now there's many people that's still looking for Malachi 4. they're still looking for Luke 17 30 still looking for the seals to be open but the anointed the anointing that is in the pride has opened our eyes where we're no longer looking but we're enjoying it we're now waiting for the bride's Revival I'm enjoying the Pride's Revival we have found truth oh my brother Josh how do you know truth because of the anointed word the the truth or we shall know the truth and the truth shall set us free so our eyes have been open has I we're no longer looking through confusion but we're looking through the truth and now our eyes have been opened look at Matthew 11 and 2. now when John had heard in the prison The Works of Christ he sent two of his disciples and said unto him or thou the the one that are your thou he that should come or do we look for another and Jesus answered and said unto them go and show us go show John again those things which you do here and see the blind receive their sight the lame walk the lepers are cleansed the death here the dead erased the poor have the gospel preached through the to them so Jesus was saying the Vindication of the anointed one was the word being flesh oh the Vindication what would Jesus say search the scriptures for when them testify of me so if you want to see the anointed word you will always say it through the Bible you will always seen through scripture and so Jesus was saying go tell John what you seem and what you hear the Vindication of who I am is through the manifestation oh and the Vindication of what this message really is is through your life oh my heart you know we there can be an argument that people can use then say the message ain't real the message ain't alive they died with brother Branham but the argument ceases when there's a young person on Earth with the life of the message in their body then that argument ceases remember the story of the blind man that had a sight the the the the the preachers went up to him and says man this is Beelzebub he's a liar he's this and he's that and he stops and he says whether he'd be a sinner or no I don't know all I know was I was blind but now I see the manifestation of the power of Christ was revealed through his vessel oh and a manifestation of the power of Christ is being revealed through your vessels our arguments have to cease oh my there's not a doubt that there's a message ain't alive because of a body on Earth that's a manifesting it so we're no longer looking but what I like about that was was John gonna have to see the physical body of Christ he just had to see the anoints of the word he had to see the manifestation and we might not see the physical body of Jesus Christ that was walked in the shores of Galilee but we know he's here because of the anointed word it's doing the same signs that was in Scriptures it has the same accents that was in scriptures it's doing it today it's Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever we're no longer looking but we have found it remember the parable of the lost coin a woman who lost her coin and she went out searching and searching but once she found it she was no longer searching but she was rejoicing come on somebody what's the bible say that she got the neighbors together I believe and says let's have a party let's Rejoice for the coin that I lost I have now found there was no there was no purpose in looking anymore because she found what she was looking for oh there's no purpose to keep looking for something to come there's no purpose in looking for somebody to open this house they're already open it's already open it's time to enjoy what was under the seals it's time to enjoy the bride's Revival it's time to rejoice and say thank you Lord for this message thank you Lord from Malachi 4. I'm no longer looking but I'm enjoying it let's Rejoice for we see what is under the seals it was John when the book was open the Bible says all under the Earth and above above the Earth hurt I John say he's seen his name and started to Rejoice because now he was no longer guessing oh Hallelujah that his name was on the book but because the seals was open he could now see his name on the book you may say brother Josh how come we can rejoice and get happy because I know that I know that I'm the serpent seed I'm the pride of Jesus Christ I'm not guessing because the seals have been open I can see my name oh I can see who I am oh my father never seen a reflection on myself I wouldn't know if I had brown eyes or if I had blue eyes I would be taking somebody's opinion oh Hallelujah I'll be using somebody else's Revelation uh and somebody could come by faith you could come up to me and say Josh you got blue eyes and I couldn't argue with her Revelation because I've never seen him I would say well Uncle Sean says I've got brown eyes and he would say no he's lying to you and now I'm passed in between two opinions it's only about an opinion until it's revealed that's pretty good the message is only an opinion to you until it's revealed then one is once it's revealed it's no longer an opinion but it's a revelation and now the devil's got no room with the Revelation Oh Glory to God I think it's time that we get a revelation of this message not a head knowledge but a revelation and when the Devil comes and he says this and he says that you can say no devil you don't know what I know you might not be able to see what's under the seals but I can see it oh I can see it with the Revelation oh my so now I'm torn in between two opinions what am I going to believe am I going to believe I got blue eyes or brown eyes and so the only way to settle the argument is to get a mirror then once I get a mirror I can see now with not with Uncle Sean's Revelation but with my own Revelation that I don't got blue eyes but I've got brown eyes and before you see your name in the book you're just guessing you're taking the pastor's word that you're going to make a Rapture come on somebody you're just taking your parents word that you're not reference hate but once you see your name what you see what's under the seals it's no more an opinion but it's a revelation you know your identity you know where you're going you know your future when you know your future you know not what you you know what's not going to happen when you know whether that's your virtuous blood what bride Blood Washed bride of Jesus Christ you know you're not going to the tribulation so you don't got to worry about it oh come on somebody you know you're not going to hell because you know your future and this this message has revealed to me my future I'm not going down I'm going up I'm not going down defeated I'm going up an overcomer I know my identity because of a revelation of what was under the seals I'm anointed I'm anointed to stand against The Wiles of the devil oh he has no right to come up or say your serpent seed with the anointing he's got no right but before the anointing thing he does got it right there's no power to enforce the word but once there's the enforcer on the inside you've got every ability every Power every authority to stand up against the Wows of the devil and say no it's not by might it's not by power but it's by by anointing it's by my spirit saith the Lord who am I so whenever you're looking for something you're you and it's right in front of you you're going to walk right by it because you're looking in the future and say oh I I was looking for my phone and my phone's sitting right here and in my mind my opinion is in the office and so if I never seen it right there I didn't know it was in my midst I'm going to walk down the stairs through one door through the other door and be farther away from it than I have ever been before because I'm following my own opinion I'm preaching now that's what happens with a man's opinions the anointing word is right in front of us right in our midst but because of men's opinions we're constantly looking somewhere else and he went to Father away all I need to do is to look and recognize that my phone is in my presence it's in my midst it's not a million miles away oh my the anointed word Jesus Christ ain't a million miles away but his presence the anointed one is right in this building it can be in your home it can be in your car it's not a Million Miles Away better right here with you oh don't miss it you got to recognize it if you don't recognize it you're gonna walk right by it oh my brother Brandon says the appearing of Christ and the coming of Christ is two different things he says he's appeared now in the fullness oh I love this in the fullness of his power not just a portion of it but his release the devil's released all of his anointing all of his authority but so as Christ he's released the fullness of his power but brother Branham says how was that how is it here by his presence being recognized so before you can use this under this Authority you've got to recognize what's in your midst oh my like I said I can't pick up my phone and operate it without me recognizing it oh and you can't pick up this message and operate it without you recognizing it it is the anointed word oh hope this is okay this evening oh my that they they uh they could see this message but without recognizing it what it really is you look at the soldier let's smack Jesus but no virtue was released to him there was no virtue but then there was a woman with an issue of blood that touched the same vessel but there was a Power released what made the difference one recognized the anointed oh and the other one didn't recognize who was in the midst so whenever you recognize the anointed that releases the power oh that releases an authority that can heal your body like those that can save your soul that can save your loved ones oh brother Branham says when the prostitute recognized the presence of Jesus at Simon's house that released to her her forgiveness oh come on somebody that released to her what she was looking for you know in every man that she went out with she was looking for something she was trying to find satisfaction you notice brother Brandon would say that God places The Thirst on the inside and the only way that that thirst can be quenched is by God himself so what that woman was trying to quench could only be quenched by the anointed oh come on somebody the only way that that's that she can be satisfied was by recognizing the anointed oh my you may be miserable you may you may feel like a wretch all you need to do is get the anointing that's what you're missing you may say brother Josh doesn't know I can't overcome pornography I can't overcome lust I can't overcome cussing you need the anointing you need something to bring the word to life hope this is okay this evening but you notice that she wasn't even that that uh uh she wasn't even the one that invited him invited him to the house it was Simon it was the other the the priest I believe that was all surrounding Jesus but they never recognized he was in their midst oh but there was a little woman that was she wasn't there I know she was a nobody she wasn't even allowed to be in there but something started to respond there was a deep responding to the deep and she says my that's who I'm searching for and you notice after she fell in love with Christ after her sins were forgiven she didn't go chased any more men because what she was looking for she found oh hallelujah what she was looking for she had found brother Branham says and I think that today we have much fun preaching many fine ministers able ministers that has brought us the word your pastors and evangelists and so forth comes through the city but I think the main thing that I'm trying to bring to you is the reality of the presence of Christ that you might see him and know him it's him by his identified promise for the day his identified he's identifying himself through the anointed word if you can just recognize the reality of the presence it will change your ideas it will change your thinking but you got to recognize it oh you've got to recognize it so once you recognize him it changes you like the like The Prostitute it changed her she was no longer following her own desires but now she was following Christ's desires and so what's your recognize the anointed word you're no longer following your own ideas your own opinions but know the words opinion has become your opinion the words idea has become your idea because the anointing on the inside has recognized the anointed and it's changed your ideas I hope you're following me this evening it's changing what you think is right brother Branham says would you deny what Jesus did himself what the Bible itself speaks out which is Christ the anointed word and if the word abides in you then you're the anointed person with the word you anointed to meet the challenge you're the one that's taken the word and saying up a might not by power but by my spirit I'm anointed the stand right here in the middle of laodicea and prove to the devil there is a bride there is a spotless Pride oh Hallelujah in that same quote you're the anointed person with the word here invited me my word abide in you then ask what you will it'll be done for you that's Christ in you the anointing anointing the word for this age oh wherever whatever age they lived in God divided his word to the ages and every time it comes to that time the church is all scrupled it up and God anoints somebody sends it down and makes the word act just exactly the way he said it would exactly there's a word promise for this day oh he knows no longer talking about another day in the past or a day in the future but he says there's a word for this present day and he says God is waiting to find somebody it's not too unusual that they can be Anointed with the Holy Ghost he's looking for somebody that's got the anointing that can recognize the anointed that to prove that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever what's proven that to the world the anointing recognizing the anointed oh when those two come together it produces the life of Jesus Christ for the Branham says because of his parents agreement his life was brought forth and he says because of God crowded though the word and the Holy Ghost he says because of their agreement the life of God is now In Your Vessel oh come on somebody because the anointed were and the anointing Has Come Together In Your Vessel is producing Jesus Christ it's no longer in word form but now it's in body form just like Jesus was word made flesh there's another body that's word made flesh that's got the same Authority the same power the same Dominion you can speak to your Mountain you can speak to the illness you can speak to that addiction oh Hallelujah and it has to happen it has to obey why the anointing and the anointed Has Come Together inside of a vessel and it's a meeting the challenge oh my cancer is challenging the Believers but there's somebody that's got enough to meet it oh my oh that's the pornography is challenging young people but they've got enough to meet it and so no devil you're not taking this vessel you may take that one you may take this one but I'm anointed I've got God living on the inside that's proven that he's the same yesterday today and forever oh my brother Branham says when Christ takes over he'll Express the word right through you he's not he said not some illusion but a real genuine Christ expressing himself right through you oh my so now we find where our Authority comes from it's when the two comes together when whenever we take the word as our head as our preeminence that produces an authority that releases something just like when the when the the The Prostitute recognize Jesus they're they're released to her what she had needed they're released to her enough the figure and when the bride recognizes the anointed that releases the authority of God that releases the authority to make the Challenge from hope this this is this is just ringing out to me this evening the definition of authority is the power or right to give orders to make the decisions and enforce obedience so before the devil had authoritate over the churches throughout the church ages they would rise up with the word then they would fall into denominationalism but in this day we're not falling down in confusion but we've got the right to give orders we've got the right to make the devil obey our confession we've got the right to save Devils I'm not going in chaos I'm not meant for the tribulation you can't take my mind oh my the devil will come with complexes and say you're a nobody who will come we're with anxiety and say you're going to fall captive the fear but with this Authority you make him obey you you're no longer obeying the complexes come on somebody you're no longer obeying the fear and the anxiety but now it's got to obey you there's an authority that has come on the inside of this bride oh there's a union that has taken place the word and the bride has become one that when they become one they've got the same name they've got the same objectives they've got the same motives and they've got the same voice they've got the same Authority oh come on somebody when me and my wife got married they didn't say I know I introduced to you Loretta Mast and Josh Martin no it was no longer Twain there was no long ways no longer separate they said now we introduce to you Mr and Mrs Joshua Martin and let me say this look I miss this and Mr Jesus Christ we've become one oh man now my wife can take my checkbook and her name is just as good as mine she could take my credit card and whatever she will not whatever she has need of but I'm not that rich but I've got limits I've got bounce I've got restrictions but her husband's got no restrictions come on somebody or her husband owns the cattle on a thousand hills if you've got a need to see then I challenge your faith if you've got a need in your body just respond to the anointing and say Lord my healing's mine the Holy Ghost is mine my loved ones is mine oh my you know dad always said I don't believe God gave me Serpent seed and that should be every parent's desire there should be every parent's confession my son may be in the world my daughter may be in the world but I don't got Serpentine and with this voice with this Authority I claim my loved ones hey you may say where's that from are you looking at Honey right how do you write recognized the anointed oh not William Brandon but the word but the Brandon was talking about the third pool talking about the squirrels that was spoken to existence and something started to respond and she said that's nothing but the truth and that anointing didn't just stay with the prophet but the same power the spoken word the anointed word went through the vessel that recognized it oh come on somebody that no longer was it just a prophet speaking the word but it was the pride it was a member of the Bride that had the same Authority but the Branham says she she looked at him and says what do I ask for she says that you're poor if you win a million dollars ask for it and it'll be right here if you want your your sister to be made well ask for it and she be well she stopped and she says I want my boys to be saved I want my my family to be saved and brother Branham says those boys were laughing and making fun but when that anoint should work went out of the anointing oh come on somebody she wasn't no longer the anointed word just with brother Branham but now the anointed word was inside of a little vessel and she spoke the anointed word and that word had to come to pass and those boys come and fell over her lap and wept their way to Calvary it's something about recognizing the anointed word in your mist oh Hallelujah brother Branham says the real pride of Christ takes the headship of the word he says there's many impersonations but there's only one bride of Christ that's the one he chose before the foundation of the world yeah you haven't chose me but I've chosen you I am Hallelujah you see we didn't go out looking for the message there was something on the inside when the message come looking for me it responded remember the story of the the eagle the eagle was now looking for mama mama was looking for the eagle but once the eagle came in and submits there was something to respond oh Hallelujah with no voice started to come forth oh what's the Bible say my sheep know my voice and another they will not follow what's the voice this a message it's a message that was rung out and there's something on the inside that's not following denominations it's following the voice of God oh Hallelujah and as that ego was set in that chicken pen he never found his identity but there became his identity flying across this chicken pen flying across the Barnyard as she began to cry begin to scream and he started to respond and as he started to respond that equipped him to fly out that the potential was always in that eagle to fly out but he needed something to tell him that once he responded to that voice his potential went from potential to manifestation oh Hallelujah oh this is okay this evening hey man I believe there's somebody that's coming under the headship of the word brother Branham says now through this headship we have the answer to the devil's question we have the answer he says he said God has Vindicated himself today through his pride with the headship so you want to see God Vindicated in your life you got to take the headship of the word you got to let the word have preeminence over every opinion over every idea then wrap their releases this Authority brother Branham says that's the reason when a man dropped dead in his meetings that he could give back his life he says because there's an authority in this headship he says this is the reason when he was in Mexico and the little boy was dead for 15 hours and he caught back his life he says brother Brandon said it wasn't those people it was the headship of God there's nothing we can do it's us responding and taking the headship Hallelujah brother Branham says what is it not them people the headship and the body has become the headship and the body has become one unit it's the god manifested in his people that's the reason the husband and wife is no longer Twain they're one God in his church is one Christ in you God's Great Revelation glory to God even bearing his name his name is Jesus the anointed the reason is called Jesus he is the anointed it's the anointed Body of Christ proven manifesting God like that body did oh my so he says there's another anointed body on Earth it ain't the physical body of Jesus Christ but there's a body on Earth doing the same signs that that body did it's the same anointing with the same anointed as the musicians come oh my brother Branham would say that if if I could get the world to see that why there you are there is the body of Christ Living standing redeemed redeemed oh my justified in His science why are we Justified we are his victory the church is his victory we come forth in the last day with this glorious gospel showing his victory he died for this purpose and we are proof of his victory we're proof of his victory you want to see Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever look at your neighbor look at the one that's recognized the anointed and you will see Christ amen can we sing

word amen the fullness of God manifested in us I uh I'm thinking of that as they just play uh I'm a song there I'm I've thought of this as Josh was preaching brother Brahm said God makes himself present in his army then he said do you believe that now he said now God said I sent them the word he just walked right over the top of it and disbelieved it I made it manifest and they crucified it I'm just getting tired I'm coming myself so here he comes God in you God above us the pillar of fire God With Us in Jesus Christ God in us the Holy Spirit so what is it the same word the same God he said no more trusting in anything else God came himself aren't you glad for that that's how you can stand in the most evil age is God came himself man amen praise the Lord and he says see this is a man-sized job so he just brought it all down and come down himself they won't have nothing to do about it just let them surrender to me and I will walk in them talking them speaking them working them thoroughly amen he said oh my that's it I will do the work just let them humble themselves let them just empty up and I will defeat my enemy out there through them can you say Amen so you know how you're overcoming he is defeating the enemy through your body all you do is just surrender all you do is just humble yourself ain't that right Hallelujah God becoming now that's just what God wants to become identified with you in you and so he is doing that in this age right he said I'll defeat my enemy uh there through them you don't do it now in yourself now you're not a match for him you're not a match for the devil if you just let God do it get the word in you then it will be all taken care of aren't you glad for that well can you give the Lord another hand clap of prey just to know it's already taken care of so don't worry about your future don't worry about tomorrow don't look and say well can I make it God identified himself in you and he says I'm going to defeat my enemy I'm gonna defeat my enemy through sister rayanna God saw you rayanna before the foundation of the world and he knew how ugly it was going to get but he says I'll defeat him through her right amen and God has done it to every one of us oh my I'm so glad to be a part of this age the greatest stage ever amen the the word revealed in this age I'm so glad that God gave us a mirror that we could look at and see him in us can you say amen I know who I am through him oh my let's sing that song Who I Am Lord who I am amen oh glorious mystery that day on the cab Set Me Free he made my heart his very Throne my life along your mind I'm a prisoner of love divine and now I live to praise His name oh Who I Am Lord it's who I am I can see now who I am a part of myself you're a part of his word it's a revelation [Music] it's predestination of who I am on Calvary he died to redeem his lost bride a king King became my savior this is God's great mystery of Love expressed to me that Christ stands I may be made one aren't you glad for that oh who I am Am Lord who I am I can see now oh who I am oh a part of my savior I'm part of this word it's a revelation it's predestination well can we sing that again oh Who I Am Lord who I am I can see now who I am oh a part of my savior a part of his word sir Revelation no more opinion it's predestination of who I am well aren't you glad you've been to church tonight Hallelujah just to know who we are in him I just love the Lord and I tell you what church we're we're getting so close to home a man that we we must keep our head up lifted up expecting him to come any moment any moment can you say Amen they're they're prophesying Doom and Gloom the economy everything is just in an uproar I uh Daniel had sent me what they had said today or sometime on the news that uh tomorrow is our deadline for the debt limit something to that effect for the America and they said well what if something don't happen I mean she faults on her payments and they said it'll be a great financial catastrophe and I'm thinking well you know the prophet's already told us we're bankrupt amen and so we we're not looking for the materialistic things we've been looking in the mirror of his word through a prophet and we found out there's a greater land I've got a greater purpose than just to be an American amen and so keep your head up your Redemption draweth nigh can you say amen God bless you sure love you appreciate you we're going to uh those that would like to meet uh across the street at the barn for some fellowship you're welcome to come uh I think there's nachos and and whatever else we have there and so if you'd like to come and and visit uh we we would sure be honored to have you and remember service um seven o'clock or 11 o'clock Sunday and just be praying that God would just move in a special way amen and next week we're going to get our tent a few of his brothers were going to to pick up the tent there in Oklahoma it's going to be a fast trip but we're excited about it and and people's just calling all around and um looking forward to the meeting and so we've got a lot to be looking forward to praying about and we just really want the Lord this could be our last meeting that we have you know if the Lord would come which would be fine with me but I just pray that God will just move maybe one more Soul one more soul amen that's that's what I'm looking for I just believe that God's still safe Souls I believe that I am thinking of uh there in Pawnee uh and I won't keep you but a a family move from New York to Cleveland Oklahoma all that's been there in round Pony it ain't nothing there I'm it's small and and so they moved from New York City to Cleveland they they wanted to get away from the city they're Pentecostal people and that didn't believe in Holiness and things like that never heard of the message but they they had the choice either to move to Texas or there and they moved there and what's amazing is is another brother from Seattle he moved his family to Paul me a year or so ago and and somehow he met up with that family and he invited them to church they had been looking they'd been in Cleveland for two years or so looking and just wasn't satisfied with nothing as far as the church and so they they they ended up coming and they came to the meeting and I they told Brother Wayne when he was preaching they told him says we about walked out on you three times and he said but every time we got ready to walk out you had magnified Jesus Christ so much that we had to say this has got to be right and what he's saying and so they they had been coming you know uh just periodically they're just really enjoying and uh uh I don't know if you my cousin Joe and his wife Stephanie I think brother Wendell had mentioned about their lives druggies I mean it's a scarred past and they ended up homeless and God got a hold of both of them she was on drugs I think she had been given cocaine or marijuana on her 16th birthday I think 14th birthday and she was hooked on all these things but God done a work so they began to talk to these this family what what God done for them and my cousin gave him three books to read serpent seed marriage and divorce and another one and said you will really enjoy this and so he uh he apparently read them and he told he told window says I got questions about these things and so he was able to have a meeting with him and at their house and have them over and begin to talk to them and they both just just wept and wept and they they said why why doesn't no one know about this why doesn't no one know he said it's predestinations they didn't know anything about predestination so he went through the Bible he said man the man jumped up ran him through the house hands lifted up just a ball and thank God I've been predestinated amen and and you know I just believe there's still somebody out there that we can reach can you say amen hallelujah we're not wasting our time ain't that right and so if God Amen brings back the backslider or brings back a new or brings a new one in it'll all be worth it over there can you say man so God bless you as our prayer amen we love you appreciate you and let's just bow our heads in a word of prayer and um brother Terry would you want to pray for us
