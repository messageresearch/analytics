Lord that you called us out of the denominational baby and into this glorious truth and many people don't understand why that they would in a prophet in this last day but when you realize that what he told us beginning the middle of the book and at the end of the book if you add one word or take one word away and with so many interpretations from the Catholic Church all the way down through every denominational system Lord but you had to send some word to straighten all this out and give us an understanding the revelation of the word that what you required Lord for a little bride to be taken

because he first loved me [Music] and [Music] you [Music] [Music] amen do you love the Lord tonight amen good to be here tonight I U appreciate the the songs that were sung if you would turn to your Bibles muss can be dismissed we could turn to Exodus 14 amen it's going to be little scripture reading is going to be just a little lengthy so just bear with me here but Exodus 14 verse 10 we're all familiar but uh and verse 10 says and when Pharaoh Drew nigh the children of Israel lifted up their eyes and behold these the Egyptians marched after them and they were sore afraid and the children of Israel cried the Lord and they said unto Moses because there were no graves in Egypt hast thou taken us away um to die in the wilderness wherefore hast thou dealt with us to carry us forth out of Egypt is not is is not this the word that we did tell thee in Egypt saying let us alone that we may serve the Egyptians for it had been better for us to serve the Egyptians than that we would die in the OR than that we would die should die in the wilderness and Moses said unto the people fear not and stand still and see the salvation of the Lord which you he will show you to uh you today for the Egyptians who you have seen today ye shall see them again no more forever and the Lord shall fight for you and you shall hold your peace and the Lord said unto Moses wherefore criest thou unto me speak unto the children of Israel that they go for but lift up thy rod and stretch out thy hand over the sea and divide it and the children of Israel shall go on dry ground through the midst of the sea and I behold I will harden the hearts of the Egyptians and they shall follow them and I will get to me honor upon pharaoh and upon all his host upon his chariots and upon his Horsemen and the Egyptians shall know that I am the Lord when I have gotten me honor when upon on Pharaoh upon his chariots and upon his Horsemen and the angel of God which went before the camp of Israel removed and went behind them and the pillar of the cloud went uh from before their face and stood behind them and it came between the camp of the Egyptians in the camp of Israel and it was a cloud U and it was a cloud and darkness to them but it gave light by night to to these so that that one came not near the uh all the the night uh near the other all the night and Moses stretched out his hand over the sea and the Lord caused the sea to go back by a strong uh East Wind all the night and made the sea uh dry land and Waters were divided and the children of Israel went into the midst of the sea upon the dry ground and the waters were a wall unto them on the right hand and on their left and the Egyptians pursued and went in after them to the midst of the sea even all Pharaoh's horses his chariots and his Horsemen and it came to pass that in the morning watch the Lord looked unto the host of the Egyptians through the pillar of fire and of the cloud and troubled the host of the Egyptians and took off their chariot wheels that they uh that they drave them heavily so that the Egyptians said let us flee from the face of Israel for the Lord fighteth for them against the Egyptians amen if we could just bow our heads tonight dear heavenly father Lord we love you and we thank you Lord for all that you've done for us Lord and Lord we thank you for another day to serve you in Lord and another day Lord to to give you the glory and the honor and Lord I pray that you would just move myself out of the way tonight Lord I pray that you would just speak through me father and I pray that your anointing would just fall aresh on us tonight anoint your congregation Lord is our prayer prayer Lord we love you and we thank you and have your way in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen you can be seated if I um had a thought tonight I would like to maybe um continue the thought on um you are anointed for it um maybe this would uh I guess you could consider it part two of when we spoke it a few weeks ago I um I haven't I haven't been able to sleep since then just uh more just kept just kept coming and and i' just feel like U that the Lord want us to go this way tonight but if I would um maybe give a subtitle I would like to maybe uh why Christ speak um and uh I'd like to uh maybe speak on this out of the message brother brandham spoke why Christ speak in 63 and um you know he he tells the story of Moses and and um if you would just bear with me tonight I would like to uh kind of just go through uh Moses like we did with David so um but uh uh and uh our pastor spoke uh Sunday on everything or a lot of things that was in my notes already so so please don't think I was copycatting him but um but uh we just pray that the Lord would have his way amen now brother brandham said that Moses was crying out to God in a time of their trouble and U God rebuked Moses for that and um and it's nature brother Bram says it's nature for someone as we know that when in trouble they cry out if someone were to to break in our home break in our car and we were there present and or someone were trying to do harm to us we would cry out uh for help and um and um and when God rebuked Moses for crying out to him you know sometimes if if you know we don't know the whole story but when we begin to read that and maybe we were reading that and God rebuked Moses and it seemed a little hard God was being hard on Moses for rebuking him that way and um and as we begin to study the Bible we listen to what the prophet has said then we find out that God knows exactly what he's doing and um so we want to uh if please bear with me as I'm going to try to lay a foundation here tonight but uh Moses was born into this world for a purpose and he was born with a gift he was born with u we all are here we all have each one of us have gifts here tonight some are has the gift to sing some have the gift to play the music some have the gift to uh to maybe uh when they're working they have just the the gift to build a house like no one else can they can you know clean like no one else can but someone has a purp or everyone has a purpose in life and um you know so so uh so but uh everyone Moses was born with the equipment in him by predestination and for knowledge of God that every person that comes into the world is born with this equipment so everyone is born with the gift and um but God U he knows the end from the beginning amen and uh if he doesn't then he is an infinite and if he's not infinite then he isn't God and uh so by God's forn knowledge he knew Moses would be the tool he would use to deliver the people from bondage amen and each one of us tonight uh can be or will be or are a tool that God can use and um but uh so he isn't willing that any should perish but knowing who would perish and who would not perish that's how um that's how that's who our God is um and that's the reason the very purpose that Jesus came to Earth was to save those that God through his for knowledge seen that wanted to be saved see because the world was uh was condemned so God knew who would want to be saved and um so by his forn knowledge he chose each and every one of us tonight and saved us because he knew we would want that amen and uh uh and he saved us knowing that we would want to be saved because he has a purpose and a plan for our life amen and and you know some of us may say well we're too young or we're too old to be used with God but as long as we're on this Earth God has a purpose for us to be here amen we may not understand that purpose yet but God has a plan for each and every one and Moses was born with a gift of faith Moses had great faith brother brandham says he was one of the greatest characters of the Bible for he was strictly a type of the Lord Jesus he was born in a very odd birth like the Lord Jesus he was um born in the time of persecution like the Lord Jesus he was born to be a deliverer like the Lord Jesus he was born um uh a very odd birth like the Lord Jesus he was hid from his parents away from the enemy like the Lord Jesus he came to uh his time of service like the Lord Jesus he was a leader like the Lord he was a prophet and he was a lawgiver like the Lord and he was a perfect type of Christ he was a king over the people and he was a lawgiver he was a a sustainer to the people he was everything and type that Christ was brother brandham says and yet to be used of God he first had to be stripped of his own ideas and from his own intellectual thinking Moses was taught in the ways of the Egyptians he was he was raised in and maybe he was raised in their seminars he was raised in their their Bible colleges he was taught the way of the Egyptians amen and and he was so well learned in their ways that he could teach their Scholars he could teach Their scientist things that's how uh well-learned Moses was and he had the great gifts in him he had the gift of knowledge he he could he could understand things and uh and brother brandham said Moses knew he was the deliverer to the people he had studied the scriptures Moses knew he was called by God to be the deliverer hundreds and hundreds of years before did it speak of that day in Genesis 15 verse 13 and and he said unto Abram know of aurity that the seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs and Shall Serve them and they shall afflict them 400 years and also that Nation whom they Shall Serve will I judge and afterward they shall come out with great substance so here in Genesis the Lord or was spoke of Moses coming in and and Moses reading these scriptures being taught of his mother Moses had a revelation that he was to be the deliverer now see Moses had to come to that time uh of of when God to use him and Moses know this intellectually and the seed that was born in him was laying in his heart so so it was there but it hadn't he hadn't met the burning bush yet and he tried through his intellectual experience with the word to try and bring them out to deliver them because he knowed he was born for that purpose yet he failed and he TR because he tried it his way he ended up killing a man CU he tried to do it on his own he seen a need there and he tried to go do it on his own and he failed amen that's the same with us if we try to try go listen to the message trying to do God a service without being his will and and here so there's a time and a place uh that God is calling us for amen but when God got him out of Egypt it took 40 years in the desert to get Egypt out of Moses amen and it's the same thing today God has called us go called a people out of denominational ideas he's called us out of Le oia uh out of the Le oysan ideas but we want to bring them into the message we want to try and bring a Baptist idea we want to try to bring a Pentecostal idea we want to try to bring in our worldly things from the lotsy and trying to bring them in the church but but we want to try we want to try and bring a lukewarm spirit in amen and but in order for the word to take effect in our lives in our homes and in our churches we first have to get Egypt out of us amen God has called us out of lay osia God has called us out of the the denominational ideas but we have to get that out of ourselves God has to strip us you got to you just got to be determined you got to get desperate and you say God no matter what it takes you've got to get this out of me amen he's called us out now get Le osia out of me amen so we got to get uh uh uh the we we've got to get Egypt amen he it took 40 years to get Egypt out of Moses amen we have to be stripped of our own ways we have to be stripped of our own thinkings and our own ideas just like Moses and all of us here before for the foundation of the world he had a little seed planted in our hearts in his in his heart and each every one of us tonight we all had a seed planted in our hearts amen and when we depend on our own selves and when we depend on our own intellectual thinking the Sun the S so n can't shine its light to make the seed come forth amen and when he began to empty when he began when we began to empty ourselves of of what we can do empty ourselves of of our own self-will and our ideas and we can watch that word when that light comes and quickens that seed we can come and watch it manifest we can watch that seed come to life Amen brother brandham says Moses was born and he was afterwards he was brought to the place where he was anointed and notice the seed laying there with an intellectual conception with all the faith that he was born to deliver this people and yet it never come to life until that light from the burning bush flashed across it until he seen not something he read about but it was something he seen with his own eyes something that spoke to him and he spoke back to it oh how does that bring life amen that brings things to life and when and when we uh uh then he got this anointing that that anointing what he had in him he was commissioned when he got that anointing God commissioned him he was ready to go to Egypt amen he didn't have to do it on his own no more but when he come face to face with that burning bush he knew God was with him heyen Amen brother Brandon says he knew what was going to take place he knew he was living in that day but he found out that he was a failure so his uh uh but his faith may have dropped back a little bit and then when he comes to the bush God said I have heard the cries of my people and I remember my promise to their fathers Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and I have come down I they are the personal pronoun I have come down to deliver them and I have chosen you and I'm sending you down to take them out and I'll be your mouth and I and you take this rod and Moses said can I see the evidence that you've s that you'll send me and and you've anointed me and you're going to do these things and and God says what do you got in your hand he said a stick he said throw it down and it turned into a serpent Moses fled and come back and he said take it up and it turned back to the stick and said put your hands in your bosom took it out and it was leprosy he put it back in and it was healed said he saw the glory of God there was no more question to Moses did you ever notice he never run to the Wilderness again he he knew he was anointed he knew where all these things that had been in his heart these great qualities and they were anointed now now he was anointed he had something within him that that his great qualities you know you can play the piano you can sing but when you want to do God of service you got to wait till that anointing falls upon you amen that's right it's okay to play the piano it's okay to play really nice anyone can let me say this anyone from the world can jump on that piano and play but when you want to do God a service you have to wait for that anointing you got to wait for God to anoint you amen true amen he said he said he is ready he is ready to go so down to Egypt he goes God has said I'll be with you so that settles it I'll be with you that's all Moses had to know and it's the same thing with us today sometimes we feel like a failure sometimes we wonder how God can use me and and you know I've done this or or I've done that and I'm not smart enough for this and and I'm not strong enough but if you would just remember that time that you came face to face with that burning bush and it spoke to you and you spoke back to him amen God says I've known you before the foundation of the world I've called you I've chosen you and I've anointed you for this purpose go take my word and defeat Satan Be not Afraid amen I I've chosen you I won't leave you comfortless but I will I'll come to you I'll be even in you amen I'll be your mouthpiece I'll be your hands I'll be your feet amen the angel of the Lord accompanies this message always amen we can stand up here with confidence knowing that the angel of the Lord is behind us speaking through US amen I'll be your mouthpiece as I was with Moses so so shall I be with you be not afraid it is I amen now they brother brand says now they said here is a man another Jew probably some of these Fanatics they've been coming along all the time with all the kind of schemes to take out the bondage you know it's different one saying well I'm the one I'm the one I'm the deliverer and uh and you know how people are when they're enslaves or in their bondage for something there is always some kind of a gimmick going around to do it God promised Moses I'll be with you I'll be with you I'll be in you my words will be your words speak my words and do exactly what I say amen Moses could now go down to Egypt with confidence Moses could go now go down knowing that the Lord was behind him they may say well Moses you tried it before and you failed but Moses says well now I'm anointed to do so now you've tried it once before Moses but he said I did that on my own but I have come face to face with that burning bush I know that I I've been commissioned to do this amen it's been Vindicated by God Amen Moses could then say but I am the I am has sent me I met face to face with God and now I know I'm anointed amen you see the difference there's a difference when you try to do it on your own there's a difference between you trying to do it and God doing it amen amen there's a difference between that calling or or uh uh uh you trying to trying to do your calling versus God anointing you amen now when Moses went down and give them this call and stood before pharaoh and told him the Lord God of the Hebrews said bring the children out and he wouldn't let them go so he performed a sign before the elders and before Pharaoh now I want you to catch this now now please listen here and the signs that God did so a sign before the elders and before pharaoh and the signs that God did he said now tomorrow about this time the Sun will go down it'll be Darkness all over Egypt and it come to pass just exactly what he said and then he said there's coming flies upon the land and he stretched forth his rod and called for flies and flies came and he prophesied and everything that he prophesied happened just exactly the way it was God see it was God speaking through Moses Moses could stand there and God God says God says I've anointed you Moses to do this so Moses could stand there and say Let There Be flies and flies will come let there be frogs and frog dogs of come let there be this let there be that let there be this and it had to happen just like Moses said because it was God speaking through Moses oh I hope you catch that now God had called them from his birth and put qualities in him of great faith and then come down with his presence and anointed that great something in him and sent him down with his word and he was properly Vindicated of his claims amen amen no matter how many Quacks and raised uh no matter how many quacks had raised up how many of these other things happened God was speaking Moses was identified with what with what Moses said God was I was identified with what Moses says God honored I want you to never forget that what Moses said God whatever Moses says God honors because God's word was in Moses I'll be your mouth it'll be the right things now when God says he speaks it through Moses and it confirmed and they Vindicated CLA his claims so no matter what Moses said God had God honored that amen cuz it wasn't Moses speaking it was God speaking amen Moses knowing that he was born for that purpose and looked out of the windows and and watched them Hebrews as they toiled look back here in the scriptures and it says and they shall soldier in 400 years see I will bring them out with a mighty hand then he comes back after a commission anointed by faith he saw those people and knowed they were the children of God yes he was to be the son of pharaoh taking the kingdom over he was next there was something there was something down in him a real faith likee and looked and look not at those things he didn't look to the glamour he was uh he was to inherit he didn't look to those fine places he could live in he didn't look at his Fine Cars he didn't look at those fine camels those fine chariots that he was to inherit Moses was to inherit everything that Pharaoh had Moses was next in line so Moses coming to this world you know he had everything handed to him he was he was scholar he was learned and knowing that he could look over the Kingdom of Egypt and know that one day this will be mine one day this this all could be mine all the Pharaohs all or all the the the Chariots all the man the Army behind me I mean this this right here could be mine you know some of us wish that sometimes you know you know a lot of times you know we we get down and discouraged we wish we had this we wish we had that you know but I want you to catch this here and but see brother BR says he didn't look at the glamour he was to inherit amen he looked at the promises of God brother Brown says he could have started a mutiny he could have rose up and started a revolutionary in Egypt and could a revolution in Egypt and could have took an army and fought he had many thousands on his side but instead of that he uh brother Bron said he was even scared to do that with armies on his side but now here he comes back 40 years later 80 years old with only a stick in his hand why why uh what was uh burning down in his heart had now become a reality he was anointed then and he know that he had thus sayith the Lord there was nothing that was going to stop him now he needed no Army God was with him that's all he needed God was with him God was with Moses sir he could have taken a whole Army he could have had the everything behind him he could have fought he could have possibly prevailed I mean uh well God has a plan and a purpose but what I'm saying is Moses had had the qualities Moses had it within him to to to to uh uh he was knowledge he could have strategized his army a certain way or or or something he could have fought back but he was scared to do that but when he come face to face with that burning bush he come back to Egypt older than he was before and with only a stick in his hand and with God's word backing him up that's right that's right oh my he had thus sayth the Lord his faith led him to take the choice of his of the word and not the glammer he took the word that's what Moses's Faith did and when Faith looks on God's word first remember there was that glamour now the world the highest king of the world and where and where was God's promise it was in the mud hole a mud Dober that's where God's promise was Moses had a choice he could either take the glamour of Egypt or or of what Egypt had to offer or he could take God's God's promise a mud Dober needing a Deliverance yeah a choice When Faith looks on God's wor it esteems Greater and more valuable than the best thing the world can show yes sir now young people catch this now now now now we want to look at the glamour we want to see how nice the world has to offer and that's what Moses had Moses had that choice he had he could have he could have stayed in Egypt he could have lived comfortably he could have just snapped his finger and they brought him food they brought him a drink anything he had need of that's what Moses had but that wasn't God's will for Moses Moses had a choice yeah he seen ah he looked to God's word yes and us tonight we have to look to the promise of God Amen God may not call us to have the to be the millionaire God may not be calling us to have the finest of cars and and the finest of uh of houses and stuff like that we just got to stay focused we've got to stay focused on the word now God blesses us I mean we thank God for his blessings He blesses us with a nice home He blesses us with the nice cars but that's not our first first uh that's not what we seek after seek ye first the kingdom of God and all these things shall be added unto you amen amen When Faith looks at it what can Faith see when faith in the word can see the word made manifest it's more than all the Glamour and everything else you can speak of Faith does it see you can see the worst the despised the rejected the whatever it may be Let It Be its worth yet faith will esteem that a million times higher than the world can produce amen God had G God has given us a commission God has GI us our pastor was saying Sunday God has given us the commission go you into all the world and preach the gospel amen Satan will try to do his best to get you to look at the glamour of the world he'll get you so focused on work he'll get you focused on having to have that nice truck and that you miss the very that God has called you to be and when we can get our faith focused in on God's word lost souls will become more important than that new truck lost souls to become more important to us than a fine house lost lost souls become more important to us amen and we and we don't want to miss the very thing that God has called us to be LW Souls become more important than money amen one day Peter and John Peter and John come to the gate called beautiful and a lame man was needing touched at the gate there was a lame man at the gate Peter didn't look to John and said hey John why don't you give him some some of your why don't you give him a brand new truck he didn't say John why why don't you give him some money he said he didn't say John John give give me the finest medicine that you can go get give me all them them essential oils give me the the the give me everything that you can think of to help this man but he said Silver and Gold Have I None but what I give to you rise up and take thy bed and walk he spoke the word he knew he was anointed for the word oh oh amen hallelujah our guns isn't going to save our family having all the money in the world isn't going to save our lost loved ones having all the latest fashions and the finest friends isn't going to get you into the Rapture having the if you if we could only focus on his will and not get our focus on the finest of medicin and and the finest of oils and because that isn't going to raise us from the de death bed amen if we could just come under that anointing of the Holy Ghost if we can let that have preeminence in our lives in our home that's what's going to save the lost that's what's going to save our home that's what's going to save our families amen you'll find that you have more power than anything in the world has to offer you'll find that you can now come boldly Before the Throne of God and whatever you ask it has to come to pass amen whatever you ask it will be given to you amen now we find Moses here after God had done so much for him and had showed him so many great signs and wonders and God said I am with you your words are my words I've proved it to you Moses when we were there when when there was no flies in that land and it was out of season and you said let there come flies so so now they've they've come they've come across they've come out of Egypt now and they've come to the the Red Sea and here uh God has called them out and and now they've come to the Red Sea and Moses is hearing the people crying Moses why have you brought us out here why did you bring us out here to die so so here he's crying out to God now and he and he's saying God why what what what what happened and he said and God says I'm with you your words is my words I've proved it to you Moses that when there was no flies in the land and it was out of season you said that there come flies and there come flies that's creation who can bring Darkness over the Earth but God he said let there be darkness and there was Darkness you said let there be frogs and there the frogs even got in Pharaoh's house and the beds and when they piled them up in the great heaps the Creator and I have spoke through you Moses and my and made my word create through your lips I've made you exactly a god before Pharaoh yes sir I've done all of this and here they come to to a place a little trial come up and Moses begin to cry what shall I do God has performed everything perfectly now he started uh started them on their Journey he's got he he's got the church together they've been called out they come uh from every denomination they they all got together Moses went back there and said Lord what must I do he say well go go do this all right go ahead and now Moses now I've called you to do this yes Lord all right now you go speak this and it'll be and here comes the Flies speak for this and here it comes do this and here it come everything was thus sayith the Lord thus sayith the Lord thus sayith the Lord the Lord and now he gets into trouble he had thus saith the Lord behind him and when a little trial come to him he didn't know what to do my and God says now I've gotten them started on their Journey they're all called out the church is together I've got them on their Journey now remember in our opening scripture he had already prophesied here for he said the Egyptians that you shall see uh uh see today you will see them no more so Moses stood before the people and he told them he prophesied to them the Egyptians you see today you will see them no more amen and then immediately he began to cry out to God God what can we do and and he said and he said he was already going to come to pass and there he was crying out what am I going to do he had already proved what he what you say will happen I'm with you he's already proved that to you and he knew that God had anointed him for this job to do this and God had clearly Vindicated his claims and it was time for the people to be deliver God through the Miracles and wonders had drawn them all together in one group brought them together in one group and Vindicated his uh his claims scripture said so there was a sign he was uh was the evidence here everything that he said then he was going to use uh then he come among them as a prophet whatever he said God honored it even to create to bring up flies and brought them into existence and everything that he had promised him there he had done it Brothers Brenham said he wanted to wait on thus sayith the Lord see he should have known that the very Vindication of his call was thus sayeth the Lord his job that he was ordained to was thus saith the Lord he was he already prophesied God had to honor everything that he said and he was called for the job he was anointed for this job so why did he have to say or why did he say ah Lord what shall I do yeah on now there was no need there there was a need it was just up to him to speak for it God wanted Moses to put that gift of faith to action that he had given him to work God had Vindicated it it was the truth and God wanted Moses wanted the people to see that he was with Moses amen God must have got enough of it God must have got fed up on with it and he said why are you crying to me about it haven't I already proved my identif ification with you haven't I already sent H sent you for the job don't tell uh don't I tell you to go this

to you Moses come on Amen it's the same thing with us today God brings us through one trial and when we come to another we start asking God why what am I going to do and why is it is happening to me and God is looking at us God God didn't say I would God said I would never leave you nor forsake you didn't I shut the mouths of lions for you didn't I bring you through the fiery furnace didn't I heal you of this disease didn't I touch you of that disease didn't I bring down Giants on your behalf didn't I do this for you right amen now didn't I send a prophet didn't I V diate myself to that Prophet didn't I have my picture taken with that Prophet oh come on God says to Moses why are you crying to me about it what are you looking at me for what are you calling out to me about haven't I

the authority amen it's not emotions that's given us an authority it's the word of God we're so glad for that and our faith must be in the word and who we are we have been commissioned in this age amen and I'm so thankful for that and you know brother brandom talked of the the faith of the um the three the three faiths the people that he had that had faith and the elevation of Faith you know um talked about gas's Jas that had the faith and he he had faith in Jesus and uh but his faith was in that to lay hands if you just come and lay hands on my daughter then she'll live and uh and that was a good good faith that was an exercise of Faith but then there was a greater faith and that was that of that Centurion man he had faith in Jesus but he recognized that there was something about him that had such an authority in his word and so he said now if you would just speak the word he said you don't have to come to my house I'm not even worthy that you would come under my roof just speak the word and my servant will live what a what a faith both men have faith faith in Jesus of who he was but then the prophet in that perfect Faith he began to talk about the faith that Jesus had amen and it was a faith that Jesus had faith knowing on who he was he knew that he could speak the word he knew he knew and I think that's where we're at today it's a faith that has come to a perfected faith that that we're not looking in in someone else to do it we're not looking at someone else's thing we're we're looking at us we can speak the word the power The Authority is within every one of us can you say amen and you know we can't overcome the devil for one another amen we've all got to overcome the devil ourselves and every one of us has got our own problems we've got our issues we got our thing we can pray for one another we can believe for one another we can encourage one another but when it's said and done we've got to look at that devil and say devil you know you have no hold on me you have no right over me amen because I know who I am I believe the word of God can you say Amen you enjoy the word tonight amen praise the name of the Lord amen the authority of God's word amen may we take courage tonight amen and don't don't cry don't don't fall apart when things come our way amen may we just remember the commission that God has given to us that he he's promised he'd never
