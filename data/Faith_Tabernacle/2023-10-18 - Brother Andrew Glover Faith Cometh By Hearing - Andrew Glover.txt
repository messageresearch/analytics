studying the other day and Paul he wrote to the Corinthians he said when I come speaking to you I didn't come enticing words of man's Wisdom but in the power of God Amen because I believe Paul had a revelation that it's not man's Wisdom that fixes the situation it's the power of God Amen well the musicians can be dismissed this evening we want to say God bless you all and my sure good to be home and good to see everyone out here on this Wednesday evening that's able to be here and those that are not that are listening at home we greet them in the name of the Lord Jesus and my isn't it good to be a Christian Amen to be saved and to be following the word of the hour I was just thinking today if we didn't have this message where would we be what hope would we have amen but with this message we have hope and we have a direction and we do want to just thank you all for all your prayers and support and love and amen we telling brother sha there the other day in Ohio I hadn't seen everybody in a long time but we sure been listening in and staying connected and my I sure appreciate our pastor and the word he's been bringing in the ministry here and amen just feeding us the message of the hour amen and I believe that's what it's going to take sister Jane to get us out of here one of these mornings amen is the word that we're hearing and as those of you know we were actually supposed to be leaving yesterday for New Zealand and Australia for about two weeks and we actually was on our way to the airport when we got the word that sister Eric had passed and just didn't feel in our heart to leave the country at this time to be able to be there for the funeral this weekend and so I know the church there and brother Donnie desires your prayers and amen I I was just reading today the prophet of God talking about in the spoken words Original Seed he said we're going to go out of this orbit someday and he said we're going to go over in that land where there's no Sorrows or sin or sickness or death and I thought Lord even so come Lord Jesus amen there's a place we can go and so tonight if you have your Bibles we want to go to the word of the Lord to the Book of Romans the 10th chapter The Book of Romans the 10th chapter then we're also going to read from the book of Revelation the 10th chapter but just a few things here tonight to speak to you from our heart and some things on our heart that we've been studying and um just some inspiration I picked up I just share a few things with you from it and pray it'll be a a blessing to you it's nothing you haven't heard but just some things that's becoming real to me and I believe if there's ever been an hour that we need faith I believe now is the hour amen amen The Book of Romans the 10th chapter and the 11th verse um and just before we read the word let's just ask the Lord to come and and bless the word tonight Heavenly Father Lord As We Gather here on this Wednesday evening father I know Lord there may just be a few of us here tonight Lord but that doesn't change your power Lord that doesn't change the atmosphere Lord as I step behind this pull pit tonight father I feel a an atmosphere of electricity Lord of Believers father of Faith oh God lord to know that they're going through things and situations and and problems but Lord there's something in our heart to push our way past all of those things to be in your presence and Lord I pray tonight as we Endeavor to look into your word I ask that you would send the spirit of Revelation into the building tonight God that inspiration could come up on your word father your word is already anointed so tonight Lord we're asking you to anoint our faith in your anointed word that we could receive something Lord that would Lord encourage us that would edify us Lord if it would correct us that we would be able to be corrected father whatever Lord that you have on your heart to give your children tonight we surrender our vessel to you and Lord I pray that as we surrender to speak your word May the Believers father surrender to hear your word and to receive your word and Lord when we would leave this place may we be able to say did not our hearts burn within us as you came and talk to us along the way and we'll be sure to give you all the praise all the honor and all the glory in the wonderful name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ we pray and all the Believers says amen and amen Romans the 10th chapter and then the 11th verse Paul here says for the scripture saith whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed for there is no difference between the Jew and the Greek for the same Lord over all is Rich unto all that call upon him for whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved I love that promise don't you how then shall they call on him in whom they've not believed and how shall they believe in him of whom they've not heard heard and how shall they hear without a preacher now watch this and how shall they preach except they be sent as it is written how beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace and bring Glad Tidings of good things but they have not all obeyed the gospel for Isaiah saith Lord who hath believed I report now you know he's actually referring to Isaiah 53 where he says who hath believed our report and brother Bram answers that question with a question and says and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed so in other words if you believe the report of the Lord then the arm of the Lord has been revealed to you which is his power so who has believed our report and can we say it like this to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed so now watch this so then Faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of God Amen Faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of God now in the Book of Revelation the 10th chapter I know that we could uh read this verse by heart but amen it's just a it's a special verse to the Believers in Revelation 10 and verse 7 uh the Bible here says speaking of this uh Faith cometh by hearing Revelation 10:7 he says but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound so he's going to begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished as Heath declared to his servants the prophets I believe if he's is going to sound somebody is going to hear that sound amen you believe that this evening we ask the Lord this evening to bless his word as you can have your seats here this afternoon I want to by the help of the Lord for just a few moments to speak to you tonight and if I would title this I want to speak to you on faith cometh by hearing amen Faith cometh by hearing 1954 brother BR preaches an entire sermon and he calls it amen Faith cometh by hearing so I'm actually just borrowing his title amen that Faith cometh by hearing brother BR said there just to read a few quotes here from that sermon he said paragraph 25 he said I'd like to speak just a moment to you on faith cometh by hearing he said and I love this word and the word of faith another place he said in paragraph 30 he said now how do we get Faith amen Faith cometh by hearing hearing what the word of God now that's right you cannot base it on nothing else but the word of God now you just cannot have faith and just say oh well if you go over here and touch that it'll make you well or if you touch the radio or touch this that the other he said no I can't go for that I've got to have something that's strong amen and the strongest thing I know of is the word of God Amen the strongest thing that I know of is the word of God in another place you said Faith first has to be based Amen on the word and the word of God produces Faith so faith based on the word and the word of God produces Faith now if God said so he said then I would believe it and I would believe it with all of my heart paragraph 39 he said Faith cometh by what then now the he's been preaching this for a while so now the congregation's catching on and the congregation says hearing he says hearing the what amen the word of the Lord see the word of God settles and Abraham believed God by faith amen because God's word said so he never reasoned he never questioned he just believed God's word is that right he said well that's the same way that we get Faith tonight is believing God's word so the same way that Abraham got got faith brother bah is the same way that we get Faith and that's by believing God's word amen and I believe that we're believing God's word which is the word of faith I believe we're also preaching God's word that is the word of faith now Romans 10:8 says what saith it amen the word is nigh thee even in thy mouth and in thy heart amen that is the word of faith that we preach so it's not something you're hearing just on the on a billboard or reading on a book but it's actually something amen that God has commissioned the ministry of this age to preach amen is the word of faith Brother's first sermon recorded on tap faith is a substance he said I wish to speak to you tonight and just take a little bit of time and teach the word of faith amen that you might know how to approach God because there's many of these great deep subjects that people claim they know much about but when it comes down to the final showdown amen they know very little of it so here a prophet is basing the entire message Amen on teaching the word of faith that's going to bring an understanding Amen to the people to approach God I believe amen that our prayer should be like the apostles in Luke 17 when they said Lord increase our faith they were actually asking God Amen not to increase their Ministries or to increase their capacity amen but they were asking God to increase their faith amen because our motive and objective amen is to get the faith of God in the heart of God's people because the prophet said like this he said so he said I ask thee kind father if you'll move back every Shadow of Doubt amen move back all the spirits of opposition so that the Holy Spirit can take the heart of the person tonight and let them see the resurrection of our Lord Jesus Christ so you're not going to see amen his resurrection just by your eyes or see it amen just by or hear it by your ears but you're going to see it amen by the faith of God in your heart now when you start talking about faith you all know that faith is a very vast subject it's a very broad subject amen and there's no way that in one service you could even begin to cover amen what faith is there's so many angles amen that we can approach Faith from and I'll say the reason why it's such a vast subject amen is because the prophet said that God is known by faith so your introduction to God Amen is by faith he said God is not known by theology he's not known by education God is known by faith amen knowledge takes a man away from God Amen but Faith brings him to God faith brings a man to God he said that's what was separated man from God In the Garden of Eden amen is he went to the tree of knowledge so there were two trees there was a tree of life amen then there was the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil amen and as long as man was feeding from the Tree of Life he was close to God Amen but the minute he left the tree of life and went to the tree of knowledge amen he separated himself from God Amen so knowledge moves you from God Amen but Faith moves you to God Amen I believe that faith has a power behind it I believe amen that faith fath has the power to bring forth do you believe that brother said I like to read the word it's an inspiration because the Bible said that Faith cometh by hearing and hearing of the word of God he said that's true amen then when we hear the word of God then Faith brings forth so when you hear the word amen that's bringing faith into your heart and as you're hearing that word it's bringing a strength to bring forth the promise of the word that you're hearing another place he said thanks be to our Lord Jesus Christ who brought again the spirit of God and the resurrected Christ who is present tonight to heal all that is in need amen he is here friends he said I have no way of bringing him to you amen only your faith brings him present amen your faith brings him present now amen I know tonight is a Wednesday night service but I just happen to be one that does not believe amen that there's Wednesday expectations and Sunday expectations or or meeting expectation I believe as believers amen every service we ought to have the same expectation amen because every service the same God the same message the same anointing the same power is being preached amen from the word of faith brother B says it very beautiful he said if you come expecting to get help from God Amen then God will meet your expectancy he always does whenever you go whatever you do whatever you expect amen brings your faith if you come saying well there's nothing to it that's just the way you're going to back go back home with nothing to it if you come tonight saying well if I don't get prayed for I'll go home and I won't be healed that's just the way you'll go amen but if you come here tonight saying I come for one sole purpose and that is to contact Christ for my body or my soul amen you'll go home just as happy as you can be amen for you will contact him no matter what the opposition looks like Christ is the answer amen no matter what kind of day you've had Christ is the answer no matter what this week is held or tomorrow holds amen or the next month holds Christ is the answer amen I love what the prophet says faith brings Christ how many agree amen that Faith brings Christ he said notice could you imagine 80y old Simeon white beard white hair amen yet the old man went around telling people that he was not going to die until he had seen the Lord's Christ he said what a beautiful picture of Faith now can I give you some things on faith amen one place he said here amen that Faith knows no defeat amen Faith knows no defeat he said faith is perfect amen Faith brings things when there's no things to be brought amen Faith creates amen Faith takes away the doubt takes away the negative amen and makes it positive so faith has the power to create it has the power to defeat it has the power to call things that are not as though they are and things that are as though they are not amen see how beautiful faith is amen and Simeon had a basis for faith listen what a prophet said faith is not mythical amen something mentally worked up amen it's an absolutely fundamental result amen that happens in a person's heart amen then what did the prophet say he said move away all the shadows of Doubt amen and all the opposition so that the people amen can see God and the power of his resurrection listen friends I don't believe that our faith is something amen that gets right when the music gets right amen I don't believe our faith is something that gets right amen when the service gets right amen I believe as Sons and Daughters of God we come here tonight amen with faith in our hearts amen it's not mythical it's not imaginary it's not something that's got to be worked up amen the only thing faith has got to be done is be released and when faith is released it can create When Faith is released it can take the negative and turn it positive When Faith is released amen it can call things that are not as though they are amen When Faith drops in a person's heart and it is appropriated it is something in the person's heart amen but it cannot be based upon well go touch a tree and you'll get welled or go touch this or pray the PO amen it's got to have a foundation faith has got to have a foundation amen another place I said like a prophet said amen faith has no hindrances he said men of all ages that has faith in what they're trying to achieve has been persistent amen now you have to be persistent you cannot just sit back and say well I see what Joe does about it you cannot do that amen before you can be persistent you have to have faith in what you're trying to achieve and if you haven't got the faith then you'll not be persistent Amen to be persistent first is to have faith and then you've got to know what source you're drawing your faith from amen that's why the prophet took time Amen to separate amen a point of contact from a stimulation of Faith amen and Faith itself amen they were touching post brother Heaven they were touching trees and that's why or Roberts had them touching radios amen and brother B said the faith is not coming from the radio the faith is not coming from the television the faith is coming from the word the only thing that is is a point of contact Amen to stimulate the faith that's in you listen friends if you're going to have faith you've got to know what source you are drawing your faith from let me say this what you're wanting amen has got to be in what you're drawing from amen what you're Desiring has first got to be in what you're trying to get it out of Amen let me say like the prophet said amen you cannot get blood from a turnip amen because it hasn't got any blood in it amen so that's the way it is you cannot get Faith from something amen that there's nothing to get Faith out of that's why the ministry is screaming if you're going to hear anything hear this message if you're going to see anything see this message if you're going to believe anything or preachers if you're going to preach anything preach preach this message amen it's the only thing that's got God's faith in it because it didn't come from a school and it didn't come from a seminary but it came from the pages of the Bible amen and it's more than just a sermon it's more than just a song it is an anointing of faith that is dropped down upon the church to manifest every promise that God's word is spoken of amen that's exactly right amen so it has to be God in here first to make Faith amen if you're going to get Faith God got to be in there to make the faith you're Desiring to get that's a powerful thing if you're thirsty amen sister sister Jane if you're thirsty you don't go to a rock unless you're Israel amen if you're hungry you don't go to the Wilderness unless you're Israel amen and the reason they got water out of the Rock Amen is there was a God in there to create the water and the reason they got Mana out of the Wilderness is because there was a God to rain it down and the reason there's a people here receiving faith for a Rapture is because God has sent them message and in that message is full of rapturing Faith that's why we're not drawing from TD Jakes we're not drawing from Billy Graham there's nothing in there to draw faith for a Rapture out of Amen but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound amen faith will come by hearing and hearing by the voice of the seventh Angel's message listen I'll say this God is in this message and God was in his messenger amen how many agree God was in his messenger if God was in his messenger he's in his message amen and I'll tell you what this message is to the believer it's the word of God and John said in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and the same was in the beginning with God and all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made listen here in John 1:14 and the Word was made flesh amen so in the beginning was the word and the source of faith is the word Faith Cometh From hearing the word so in the beginning was the word amen and The Well of Faith was invisible it was God the spirit but there was faith in him but watch in John 1:14 and the Word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us amen so the Fountain of Faith amen moved from the invisible to the visible amen all that was in God he poured into Christ and all that was in Christ he poured into the church amen then the Fountain of Faith amen moved from God in spirit form into flesh form Amen in Jesus Christ and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory amen the glory as of the only begotten full of the father amen full of grace and truth amen now listen what a prophet said then when this Greek woman heard of Jesus Faith cometh by hearing amen she was a Greek a heathen amen so she heard and she come you know what faith finds a source amen that others do not see amen Faith finds a source that others cannot see amen that's why the prophet of God As I said was separating amen a point of contact for Faith amen from the source of Faith amen that radio was not the word that television was not the word that pole was not the word amen but the god of heavens and earth is the word and he is the source of faith and the prophet said like this he said not touch a pole touch something else or a totem pole or some man or some woman I believe Amen in Touching God through believing his word through faith then when you do that amen that word becomes in you a life amen a germatize word and every one of God's words is gerti then the only thing you take a handful of Wheat and hold it here on the platform it'll never make anything there it's got to be in the ground not only grounded but in the right kind of ground to support it and if the good word of God Falls in poor ground it'll bring a poor crop you take take a good grain put it in good ground in the right condition to bring forth a h hundredfold so is the word of God when it's brought into the human heart amen with a faith undying faith in the Lord Jesus Christ with the Holy Spirit and the power of God is there to water it it'll germatize and bring forth everything it said it would do amen it's a word it's the word of God listen friends this word amen falling in that Pew is not going to produce a body change this word falling in that chair is not going to produce a root CH come on church I'm preaching the word of faith through this microphone amen but this microphone is not going to take a change amen but the one holding this microphone is going to take a change amen because there's an undying faith in my heart amen and this message is anointing my faith to believe that God is able to take an old body and make it young again this word is anointing my faith to believe that the dead are going to raise Incorruptible this word is anointing in my faith to believe that some morning our loved ones are going to appear behind this church amen what is it amen the word falling into a heart that's ordained to bring forth the promise of the word that's falling into it amen the word is falling in those pews but those pews ain't going to take a change amen those pews are not going to bring forth a body change but there's some people on them pews well come on Church there's some people on them pews that's been taking this word in for years and some morning their body is going to obey the word they're hearing amen when you think of this spiritual hearing the Bible speaks of it the Bible actually speaks of the spiritual hearing of Believers in Proverbs 8:34 the Bible said blessed is the man that heareth me amen watching daily at my Gates amen waiting at the post of my doors Proverbs 15:31 the ear that heareth the reproof of life amen abideth among the wise in Ecclesiastes 5:1 amen keep thy foot when thou goest to the house of God and be more ready to hear than to give sacrifice of fools for they consider not that they do evil in James 1:19 he said wherefore my beloved Brethren let every man be swift to hear he me and slow to speak and slow to wrath brother Amos I can't read that verse without thinking about my old high school teacher she used to say it like this at the Christian School she'd say the Bible says be swift to hear and slow to speak she said you know why cuz you got two ears and one mouth you're supposed to do more hearing than you are talking good free of charge amen let every man be swift to hear and slow to speak amen now you all realize tonight the Bible says amen that the word would be spoken by the prophets in Amos three the Bible says the word of the Lord amen comes to the prophet now listen what a prophet says in the spoken word is the Original Seed he said my mission I believe to the Earth is what amen is to forerun the coming word amen my mission to the Earth is to forun the coming word see the coming word which is Christ amen and Christ in him has the Millennium and has everything right there amen because he is the word amen who is this speaking who is this this is the messenger of Revelation 10:7 in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound and here he is saying my mission to the Earth amen is to forun the coming word amen and that word is Christ and in him is the Millennium and in him is everything we have need of Amen because he is the word then Paul said Faith cometh by hearing amen and hearing by the word then can I say this to you amen your rapture is going to come by the word your body change is going to come by the word your healing is going to come by the word your Victory is going to come by the word your deliverance is going to come by the word joy and peace and happiness amen and satisfaction is going to come by the word because the word is a word of faith and it's the Christ of the Bible speaking to the church amen now I love this when a prophet says this he's in front of something and there's something coming behind him amen there's something that he's forerunning there's something he's announcing and whatever he's announcing he's going to turn the attention of the church to what he is sent to forrun and what he sent to forrun is the Bible the word which is the source of Faith which is Christ remember said there and spoke the words Original Seed he said there's been three seeds sown there's been a denominational seed there's been a Pentecostal seed he said then there'll be the word seed he said and the word seed will be sown amen by the messenger of Malachi 4 Listen brother Shi he says he will seow the entire word seed Bible in the church amen then whatever he was forerunning was not a partial word it was not a partial restoration it was the entire word seed of the Bible was going to be swn into the church now in that message he says he goes to the book of Luke's 8th chapter let's just read that Luke's 8th chapter and the fourth verse amen it's a very powerful reading in Luke 8 verse4 the Bible said that when much people gathered together amen they were come out of every city amen and he spake by a parable now you all know what a parable is it's a Earthly story with a Heavenly meaning amen he spake by a parable and he said a soul went out to seow his seed somebody say his seed a swer went out to seow his seed and as he sowed amen some fell by the wayside I want you to notice something here amen there's four different types of ground amen the first one is amen the Wayside ground and it was trotten down and the fouls of the air devoured it in verse number six amen some brother amus fell Upon A Rock Amen and as soon as it was sprung up it withered away because it lack moisture stops and says moisture Baptist Presbyterian Lutheran without water and when he's first converted he looks right straight to Christ and he believes but then the first thing you know that denomination binds him up into a place and the moisture of the spirit is gone from him he becomes denominational and he's dead now watch this some fell among the rocks and some fell among the Thorns amen and the Thorns sprang up with it and choked it out now watch this just what I thank the Christian businessmen and the rest of them Pentecostal organizations these people that's building all these big millions of dollars of things he said the riches of the world Amen has choked out the glory and the spirit of God Amen and they are dying because it's choked amen so not only are they lacking moisture but now brother Bill the very life of the word is being choked out amen because the things that are coming in the church are choking the life out it's the world the cares of the world Amen it's choked them out he said the women wants to be active and Bob off their hair and have Waterhead haircuts and wear shorts and look like the rest of the world Amen the preacher stands up in the pull pit amen and they practice their amens and Afraid of the word of God Amen because of a meal ticket if they cannot ride a Cadillac they're not even considered spiritual anymore that's right if they can't dress in the best of clothes do everything else they're considered amen backslid they're not so and so amen that's that that fell upon Thorns but watch in verse eight amen but other fell on good ground so there's Wayside there's rocks there's Thorns but then there's good ground Watch what it done and it sprang up amen and bear fruit a h hundredfold and when he had said these things he cried and said he that hath ears to hear Amen Let Him hear now watch this he that hath ears to hear Amen Let Him hear what is he hearing he is hearing the word of God that is being forerun because the word always has a forerunner amen and the one that's forerunning that word is announcing what's in that word and he said Christ is in that word then everything the church has need of is in that word I love how the prophet brings this testimony into this scripture amen y'all remember over in Finland when the boy died the prophet of God said watch he said remember little boy being raised from the dead in Finland how many here wrote that in their Bible before it come to pass you heard me speak of it in the auditorium raise your hand he said about the little boy being raised from the dead in Finland he said see your hands go up all over the building everywhere look at it amen see that was long before it took place so years before it took place there were people that was hearing that word and they were writing it down in their Bibles and the prophet said see amen it always speaks that way and you just write it down it's perfect for it's not man that's speaking it's God Amen this is God's voice to the people every word of God is a seed and will produce exactly like it's spoken the Bible amen if it's received in good ground he said now that's God's voice to his church listen friend somewhere sometime amen the word had been a commission to be forerun by prophets and he was in position in Finland over at dead boy no life in him amen but he spoke the word of Christ that had Resurrection in him and he said if this boy's not off the ground in five minutes I'm a false prophet and in five minutes time a boy that was crushed to death under a car got up and lived again because the word was a good word and there was good ground to receive the good word amen come on church I believe that same word is in this building tonight and the devil's done everything he can to kill our expectations to kill our faith to kill our vision to stomp out our joy to choke out our praise amen but I speak the name of Jesus which is the word of Resurrection over this church and I say Satan you are defeated the word has been forun it is fallen into good ground and there's a good ground to produce the good word and they're going to raise up again and they're going to live underneath that word because this word is God's voice to his church the word is God's voice to his church I just thought this kind of interesting today brother God said lady come up here if all that long message in time amen if all that long message in the time if it just fell by the wayside then the birds of the air will gather it he said some will Paul in pretty good ground somebody say pretty good ground you know that sounds pretty good don't it brother Joe pretty good ground but listen what a prophet says they may believe for a few days so brother Terry there's a difference in pretty good ground and good ground after a while by and by the hot weather and the scorching people said did you ever go there that meeting well there wasn't nothing to it Scorch away others will come up amen and they will think it's a little more and they'll fall away but some will fall in good ground amen the same word that fall falls upon pretty good ground we've all seen pretty good ground amen pretty good for a few days but then they're gone amen but watch we're all responsible as sewing and God has to direct the seed because he knows who's his from the beginning God knows who's his from the beginning amen so God sends out a good word to a good seed to produce a good result in Psalms 80 ver8 the Bible said thou has brought a vine out of Egypt thou has cast out the Heathen and planted it thou has prepared this room before it and did his cause it to take deep fruit and it filled the land remember said you picked up the vine out of Egypt and you brought it out and planted in a good place he said that was Israel God's people that was in Egypt they were a good Vine they were God's chosen amen but if a good Vine isn't set in good ground it'll not bring forth good fruits it depends on where the vine is planted will determine the results of the crop so God picked up Israel out of a Barren land he said something like today we got a land many great and fine Believers they're all mixed in denominational churches they come from different denominations different walks of life that's why in my Ministry I have never tried to at any time to run down any certain person or any denomination because in them is all good people they're all God's called and chosen people could you have condemned Israel amen while it was in Egypt they just got off on the wrong foot and their sins had separated them from God they were planted in Egypt that's the way many people are in churches today they're good people people just planted in the wrong place amen they're good people just planted in the wrong place if a real believer is brought to Christ he is planted in some great denomination that doesn't believe in miracles signs and wonders of the Lord the person may be a genuine Christian a Catholic Baptist Presbyterian over witness something else in that church a genuine Vine of God Amen but the denominational Creeds will cut off the life of the vine it cannot bear its fruit and usually what fruit you get off the vine that's stuned amen or not in good ground is bad fruits it'll come forth like apples but it'll be naughty and worm eaten it becomes a subject for all insects amen and good healthy Vine doesn't even have to be sprayed amen it's healthy enough to throw off all its enemies amen Church why are you still here tonight amen because you're not pretty good ground you're not just thrown out there but your good ground that's been planted by the good word amen and there's something in you amen that you don't have to be babied and patted and petted and well if so and so didn't call me amen if the preacher didn't visit me amen no there's something in you amen that shakes off the enemy and comes on to the house of God Amen there's something in you amen that knows how to shake off a devil and give God the praise there's something in you that when you fall down you know how to get back up and say if God be for me then who can be against me come on church amen I think we're past the stages of being babies where we got to be petted and pampered amen I believe there's some strength in the vine of Jesus Christ that is in the Church of the Living God Amen and we can shake off its enemies amen it's born again don't have to be sprayed around and patted they're spiritually healthy enough to throw off all the scandal of the world they're living off of the true nourishment now we know what a seed when it falls in the right kind of ground not upon rocks with no root or in thorns and thistles that would choking out but in good Rich fertile faith I like that good Rich fertile Faith every seed will bring forth of its kind I'm just going to and just let the evangels come out for a minute we all know that every seed or promise of God will bring forth of its kind what it's promised if it strikes the right ground the ground that's prepared ready all the Rocks has been thrown out and The Roots and the bitterness come on church and the selfishness and the indifference and the jealousy has all been grubbed out that root of bitterness that Springs up that sometimes so spook the thing amen that God is trying to do amen listen a prophet emphasized Amen on a root of bitterness that'll spring up amen and'll try to Rob amen and stop and spool the thing that God is trying to do can I tell you what Paul said he said that a root of bitterness would spring up amen unexpectedly amen and here the prophet says that bitterness amen is something that tries to spool the thing that God is trying to do he said we pray there wouldn't be none of that among us but for good word well find good ground amen four different types of ground I want you to catch this the disciples in verse 9 the disciples ask him saying what might this Parable be and he said unto them it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God but to others in Parables that see and they may not see and hearing they may not understand look here in Luke 8:1 now the parable is this that the seed is the word of God so his seed is the word of God that falls brother Kevin on four different types of ground I want you to catch something here amen all hear the seed word the Wayside ground heard the seed word the rocky ground heard the seed word the the the the the the the thorn ground the Wayside heard the seed word and the good ground heard the seed word because there's four different types of ground but in verse 12 he begins to show us the four different types of hears he said those by the wayside are they that hear then cometh the devil and taketh away the the word out of their heart amen lest they should believe and be saved can I tell you what kind of hearers they those are they are indifferent hearers in verse 13 they on the Rock are they which when they hear receive the word with joy and these have no root which for a while believe but in the time of Temptation Fall Away sister Jame those are emotional hears Amen in verse 14 that which fell among Thorns are they which when they have heard go forth and are choked with cares and riches and pleasures of this life and bring forth no fruit to Perfection can I tell you what they are amen they are worldly hears but I love verse 15 because that on good ground are they which in an honest and good heart having heard the word amen they keep it and bring forth fruit with patience you know what kind of hearers those are they are receptive hearers amen so they're not just hearing emotionally they're not just hearing iny they're not just hearing worldly but they're receptive hears and look at what this word heard means it means to be endued with The Faculty of hearing not death to consider what is or has been said amen listen this to give ear to a teaching or a teacher to comprehend or to understand now come on Church you all y some of Y all set through calculus and you sat through algebra and you set through through through through uh physics and you you set through all kinds of classes and you couldn't have bit more today like I can't amen tell you what you learned then you could then because you was just there because you had to be you are not a receptive here amen but there's a bride in the last days that's not just hearing this message through a worldly filter she's not just hearing it through an indifferent filter she's not even just hearing it through an emotional filter but there is a fing man's filter and it's called the word of God and it is falling upon her life and when she hears the word she believes the word she receives the word amen and she gives an ear she gives her spiritual ear to the teaching of the word of God that she's hearing because she knows that this is going to change her future come on church she knows that this is going to change her body she knows if I don't pay attention to this I'm going to find myself in a tribulation period but if I can hear the word then faith is going to come in my heart and that heart faith is going to be rapturing faith and the Millennium is going to be behind that word and I'm going to find myself in the glories of God and the eternities of God because I heard I believed I received I don't know about you I want to be a receptive hearer I want to be a come on Amen I know we listen to tapes amen but let me just say this amen don't just listen driving down the road come on I driving down the road you got to pay attention this car and look at this sign and watch for that exit come on but when you hear I'm not telling you not to listen in your car but sometimes you just got to shut off everything you got to shut off the phone you got to shut off the world you got to shut off a job and you got to get yourself in a place that you can be more than just an emotional hearer you can be more than just a worldly hearer you can be more than just an indifferent hear but you can be a receptive he you can give your ear to the teaching of the word of God I love what the prophet said he said as we read the words tonight and teach from Thy word may it give Faith to The Listener and may the seeds fall in good ground and bring forth a h hundredfold amen I tell you this the Bible speaks of it in Ezra 8: 211 the Bible says then I proclaimed a fast there at the river of ahava that we might afflict ourselves before our God watch what he says to seek of him a right way for us sometimes you got to humble yourself to seek a right way from God for your family listen church and for our little ones and for all of our substance in Jeremiah 42:3 the Bible says that the Lord thy God I'm sorry guys I didn't give them to you for church y'all forgive me the Lord thy God Amen may show us the way wherein we may walk and the thing that we may do I love Psalms 143:10 David says teach me to do thy will for thou art my God thy spirit is good amen lead me into the land of uprightness now watch what David's saying you're not going to find the land of uprightness unless somebody leads you into it so David humbled himself and said God I know I'm a man after your own heart brother Daniel he knew how to sling a slingshot he knew how to play a har he knew how to bless the name of Jehovah but here David humbles himself and says God I need you to be my teacher I need you to teach me how to do thy will I need you to teach me how to find the land of the uprightness come on there's going to be times Church well let's just go ahead and preach it's Wednesday night we might as well you don't know that all that neither do I so sometimes we got to Humble ourselves and say God will you teach me your word will you teach me your will come on church amen I tell you what God did not give us a pastor in this church amen just to make sure there's somebody to feel the pull pit three times a week amen but a pastor is a Shepherd a pastor is a leader a pastor is a voice of God to the Church of God listen friends and he's more than just a preacher he's a counselor he's a comforter he's a guide and whatever he's teaching ought to be more than just a good Sunday morning sermon it ought to be more than well just brother Sean done a good job we ought to Humble ourselves and say God use my pastor to teach me the word to Lead Me In the Land of the uprightness because Faith cometh by hearing hear in now I know I know people don't like to be taught it's an age where everybody knows everything but guess what I don't know everything and neither do you but God sent us a message that does brother B said what rather watch your in Proverbs 9:9 give instruction to a wise man and he will yet be wiser woo brother give instruction to a w well brother Terry a wise man's already wise but here the Bible says if you give instruction to a wise man he will be yet wiser he says teach a just man and he will increase in learning teach a wise man something and he'll be wiser amen you want to know the difference between a wise man and a fool amen a wise man will be wiser and a fool will be more arrogant well else glory to God somebody shout amen ouch oh me my or something are you hearing me amen a fool will say well I know that and I know how to do that amen but a wise man will say I'm wrong and whoever is right is right and I want to be wise Wier so I'm going to humble myself I'm going to give myself to the teaching and a just man will say Lord I want to increase in learning now you all know what the prophet said he said preaching the word catches The Sinner he said but teaching the word amen positionally places the believer and you can never have faith until positionally we know what we are can I say this to you from my heart it is essential somebody say essential it is essential to have a teachable spirit it is essential to have a teachable spirit in the unpardonable sin the prophet said then when we come sanely sound to God when we come without any malice any Prejudice with an open heart amen willing to learn amen God is able to teach when we are willing to learn so there's no question of God's ability to teach us the question of ability is are we able to Humble ourselves and learn but we must first lay aside tradition I may get tied here for a second amen but the teaching of the message will have no influence upon a traditional heart amen the teaching of the message will have no influence Upon A Heart amen that's full of things and ideas and preconceived notions listen friends either this message is a filter or it's another idea but I believe it's a filter and I believe it's coming this generation to filter out every tradition to filter out every previous idea that we might come back to good ground and receive the word with a heart to hear and a faith to believe and a mouth to confess and a spirit to be taught lay aside tradition lay aside ideas that we've been taught he said now I know mother taught you things that was very good and so forth but sometimes amen mothers had things wrong now come on Church brother BR backs that up and things are to be in 1965 and says the church has grown from what our mama taught us about heaven and said it's not somewhere brother Shi that we go play a harp and we float around on the the clouds he said that's what our mothers taught us amen before the word come into existence the opening of The Seven Seals and brought a revelation in the church amen that heaven is a real place well if you want to hold on to what mama taught then you're still looking for a harp and you're still looking for a cloud and you're still looking for bodies to go floating through the air amen but if you want to lay aside what mama taught and believe what the prophet of God T you will believe that the Rapture is already started you will believe that you're in the rapsure progress right now by the preaching of the message of the hour something is moved in you that you've laid aside tradition come on church sometimes you got to lay aside tradition to move further you cannot stay where life was you got to get to where life is come on church and one time life was in just I live by faith and it was in sanctification and it was in the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen but life has moved from the stalk it's moved from the tassel it's moved from the husk and the seed has gathered in the seed then every ounce of life that was in justification is in this bride every ounce of life that was in sanctification is in this bride and every ounce of life that was in the baptism of the Holy Ghost age is in this bride are you hearing me you got to have a teachable spirit it's essential you know what teachable is it's essential Amen to enter into God's Kingdom in Matthew 18:3 the Bible said verily I say unto you except you be converted and become as little children ye shall not enter into the Kingdom of Heaven I just St there something struck me amen he did not say in Behavior he meant in humility of Spirit come on now because Paul said when I was a child I spake as a child but there come a time I laid aside childish things and become a man teachableness is exhibited by by the disciples in the Book of Luke 11:1 it came to pass that as he was praying in a certain place when he ceased one of his disciples said unto him Lord teach us to pray as John also taught his disciples I want you to catch this word teach it means to impart instruction it means to instill Doctrine into one it is the thing taught to explain or expand a thing to teach one something you know what teachable this was it was manifest in the blind man of John N in John 9:36 he answered and said who is he Lord that I might believe on him you know what teachable this also was manifested in it was manifested on the day of Pentecost when the Bible said in Acts 2:37 when they heard this they were pricked in their heart and said un Peter to the rest of the Apostles men and Brethren what shall we do so they're humbling themselves that they don't know what to do but there's somebody here that does know what to do come on church amen teachableness is seen in the Ethiopian unic in Acts 8:31 he said how can I except some man should guide me and he desired that he would Philip that philli would come up and sit with him you know what teachable this is also it was the secret of Paul's success in Acts chapter 9:6 and he trembled and astonished said Lord what will thou have me to do and the Lord said unto him arise and go into the City and it shall be told thee what thou must do are you hearing me amen here's a man that's got the intelligence of Gia he's met the pillar of Fire he been changed from Saul to Paul but in all those Supernatural experiences he never lost the ability to be taught by the spirit of God you know what teach of us is it is a result and we see the result in the Philippian jailers conversion in Acts 16 verse 29 then he called for a light and sprang in and came trembling and fell down before Paul and Silas and brought them out and said sir what must I do to be saved remember what that word here means it means to give an ear to a teaching or a teacher can I ask you a question who is the teacher who is the teacher not a trick question the holy spirit in John 14:26 he said the comforter which is the Holy Ghost amen the Holy Ghost whom the father will send Amen in my name he shall teach you all things and he bring all things to your remembrance whatsoever I have said unto you in John 16:13 watch this how be it when he the Spirit of Truth is come he will guide you into all truth what did David say he said teach me of thy will Lord and guide me into the land of uprightness and here the spirit of Truth is going to be the answer to David's prayer come on Church David did not receive the Holy Ghost cuz the Holy Ghost had not yet been given but Church the Living God your identification is the Holy Ghost and he is the teacher and he is the guide and he will not speak of himself but whatsoever he shall hear am in that shall he speak and he will show you things to come oh my it's one of them it's one of them shouting quotes I found today B said you had a little while and the world will see me no more that's the body will be taken away but you'll see me for I'll be with you even in you to the end of the world he said that's Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever now he will return in his body again and will sit on a literal Throne a man will eat and drink and Shake Hands Oh Glory oh my you say you're too emotional brother why it makes you emotional you cannot hold yourself when I think of it how could you stand at a ball game or something like a real like a real well you know a fisherman how can you catch a great big bass about five pounds and a big old grin he said sure something has happened and he said when you really get saved and filled with the Holy Ghost something happens when the word of God begins to manifest come on church amen when the when the come on Amen when the sports teams gets the victory something's happen there's now a manifestation of Victory when a fisherman kills or kills show you how long it's been since I've been fishing when a fisherman catches a fish amen there's a manifestation something's been caught with the Terry and now the reaction is to the manifestation come on when a deer is killed amen you kill that deer amen you don't shout your away the tree stand but when the manifestation of the desire has taken place you can shout your way back to the truck amen well what about it church amen I believe that God has come down in this age through the message of the hour the word of God and has been manifested and we are setting together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus and the Holy Spirit is teaching us and guiding us and setting us in order well there ought to be a little shouting about that there ought to be a little emotion about that come what's wrong with getting happy when we see the church get back in order what's wrong with getting happy when we see the Holy Spirit come down on the preacher and carrying Beyond his human education and begin to teach things that has confounded religious leaders for years there ought to be a shout in the house of God when the spirit of Truth breaks out in the meeting and begins to guide you from depression into Joy begins to guide you from sickness into hell begins to guide you from confusion into peace and speakable and full of Glory I'm talking about somebody that's heard the word they've seen the manifestation and it's moved them they're moved by it amen I know I know I'm get in trouble I know some people don't get moved till they get the microphone well that's jealousy and you're pretty good ground I know some people don't get moved to they they don't get moved till they get called on well that's that's pretty good ground but if you're good ground it don't matter if you got a mic or not it don't matter if you're on the platform or not you're just happy to be found in the house of God one more time under the spout where the Revelation is coming out where there's an anointing falling and there's a teaching taking place come on Church y'all know I believe in teaching I believe in good Bible Holy Ghost teaching I tell you what I do not believe and it's a bunch of educated men getting behind the pull pit and teaching the holy ghost out of the church and I tell you what we've defined teaching as we've defined teaching as anybody that can't preach well let me just say this amen I believe in good Bible teaching but good Bible teaching is going to teach the word of God and not be the people out of the power of God it's going to bring an emotion come on Church am I probably had to preach a whole sermon let you know I believe in teachers I believe in Bible teaching but I do not believe in dead letters killing the church I believe if a man's called brother Terry there's an anointing upon him there's a blessing upon him there's an inspiration come on church amen I've seen preachers never move behind the pull pit and I was about ready to explode and I've seen guys never move behind the pull pit well come on Church I'm I'm this far into I might as well preach amen I literally set sister Jane in services and never seen the man move from behind the pull pit but something inside of me was welling up because there was a certain sound I was hearing and I've seen guys run all across the platform and I was checking my watch to see when they'd be done cuz there wasn't nothing said amen to move me from confusion into order if this message is preached there's going to be a demonstration of the power of God come behind the word and set the church in order and teach the church the will of God and guide the church into the land of uprightness what a wonderful time oh my when the Holy Ghost breaks out on the church now I don't know about this I'll just say thank God for our men of God that preach this message thank God for our teachers that stand there and labor in the word thank God for our vanss that come in like a house on fire and then they get out of the way thank God for our pastors who who who who Bear Down Under the load and they carry the load when it's TR come on church amen but there's an anointing behind them now the tutor always pointed that I'm I'm GNA get through that the tutor always pointed the child of the father and to have him to be the have him to believe the father and when the tutor was a trainer this morning as I was looking at my dear little companion and I seen my little son think about this I seen my little son when he throw his little tan temp tantrum at the table with his little dish with his eggs and things the mother had worked so Faithfully to fix for his breakfast and she was trying to teach teach him to eat with a spoon and he wanted to take the wrong hand brother am he wanted to take the wrong hand he said well to me I said let him have that hand but the mother no different she knew if she let him keep on that way he'd be either ambidextrous or he'd be left-handed I was on the phone with Josh Martin I read that quote I said I just found out you're abnormal you're left-handed and then I got thinking they put me in a class to prove I was ambidexter so I'm I always heard it brother amamos I didn't know it was actually they actually considered it wrong but the prophet of God said why watch he said if she let him keep that way it'd be either ambidexter or he'd be left-handed and that's not normal so a real trainer as a real trainer she made him change hands though he didn't like it but the mother knowed it was the best and many times our train of the Holy Spirit we try to do the wrong way but sometimes it hurts us woo brother sometimes it hurts us listen sometimes we may lay on a bed of Affliction sometimes the doctor May say all Hope's gone but it's the Holy Spirit teaching us to use the right hand now come on let's let's move out of left hand right hand let's move into the word of God the Bible says to whom has believed our report and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed then what a prophet was showing you I don't have time to get to it I'm out of time but he says this he said see it's the power of God that will change the man Christ the mystery the power of God will change the man and Paul said when I come to you I did not come to you in enticing words of man's Wisdom can I say it like this brother Sean left hand I did not come to you you with the left hand of man's Wisdom but I come to you in the power and the demonstration of the Holy Ghost y'all forgive me this is going out the internet and I got a bunch of left-handed friends you're not abnormal are you are you hearing me a amen he was showing you amen change hands move from wisdom into faith and church Living God some of y'all right here tonight need to let the Holy Spirit move you out of wisdom into Faith because wisdom's taking your shout and it's taking your vision and it's taking your praise but if you can move from the wisdom of man into to the power of the faith of God it'll open up a whole new dimension to you you'll see beyond your problems you'll see beyond the report you know why amen because the teacher the holy spirit is not on the outside he's come on the inside oh my are you hearing me then brother Terry all these years that you've been giving your ear to this message you've been lending your ear to the teaching of this message the teacher has now moved from the outside to the inside I'd have paid a hundred bucks for the teacher to take my my test in school she had a passed him unlike me I are you hearing me you wanted the teacher to always be there but there come a time that the teacher couldn't be there but it's not so with this teacher Oh Glory it's not so with this teacher he said when God is silent we had better be silent but where he has spoken we had better speak too and say what is already said he told us the evidence what would happen after being baptized with the Holy Ghost watch this the teacher would come and teach all truth but that teacher was an inside teacher not an outside teacher if the spirit wasn't inside then you wouldn't hear the truth and receive it by Revelation if you heard it every moment of the day woo brother if the spirit wasn't inside you wouldn't hear the truth and receive it by Revelation if you heard it every moment of the day that was the sign of the indwelling indwelling spirit in the days of Paul those who were filled with the Holy Ghost heard the word they received it and they lived by it and those who did not have the spirit heard it as only carnal men put a wrong interpretation on it and went into sin but in every age is the age of the Holy Ghost for the True Believer I say in every age the evidence was the same those who had the spirit the teacher they heard the word and that spirit in them took the word and taught it revealed it to them and they were of the group that heard heard the message and the messenger and took it and lived it our musicians are coming tonight brother said this in the resume of the church ages l a c age he said this is the age that turned to the 20th century as it was to be the age in which the true church would be return to be the bride she was at Pentecost we know that there must of necessity be a return of dynamic power brother Amos there must be a necessity think about that brother Amos there must be of a necessity a return of dynamic power Amen Brother Bill a return of dynamic power necessity what's that word brother amus necessity it's got to be here so it cannot just be in letter letter letter but the dynamic power has got to return and the Believers sensed it in their spirits and begin crying to God for new outpouring such as was in the first century now watch this what seemed to be the answer came as many begin to speak in tongues manifest the gifts of the Spirit it was believe that this was indeed the long awaited restoration it was not for the latter rign can only come after the former Reign which is the spirit or teaching rain so the latter rain then is the Harvest rain and how could this be the real thing when the teaching rain had not come the prophet messenger who was to be sent to teach the people and to turn their hearts back to the Pentecostal fathers had not yet come thus what was thought to be the restoration the final quickening of the Rapture had not come in it was a mixture of the unrighteous partaking spiritual blessing and manifest manifesting in the Holy Ghost as we have kept poined out to you it is also oh my it is also devil power as men was under the control of devils yet no one seemed to realize it then to prove that it was not real these people even before his second generation had appeared organized wrote their unscriptural doctrines built their own fences as every other group ahead of them did but a it's that necessity of dynamic power can I tell you what that Dynamic power was it was the voice of a seventh angel yes that stood in the pull pit and screamed to these people come out of her that's right come out of her my people and be not partakers of her sins you love him tonight I believe he's real don't you listen I believe the sound has gone out into the land and I believe there's some receptive hearers that have given their ear to this message and the teacher not on the outside but now he's on the inside isn't it a beautiful thing brother Bill when you come to church and you hear the preacher preaching and you're sitting there and what he's saying you're already agreeing with and brother Amos things are connecting in your mind and the words just coming together brother Sean things are just connected left and right and you're literally sitting there thinking well I just read that and I just read that you know why because the spirit teacher on the pastor is the Same Spirit teacher in you and what he's preaching the spirit's preaching through him the spirit in you is bearing witness because the one Speaking is the one that done the writing are you hearing me and the spirit that's receiving is the one that's speaking that done [Music] the faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word that's why Eagles don't respond to the sound of buzzards I told somebody other day I come out of a service and brother Bill they looked at me they said but Andrew you you're a pretty emotional person you was pretty quiet I said yeah I said I'm sorry I didn't have a clue what the guy's talking about he kind of looked at me said what do you mean I said well I study brother Brown I don't have a clue who he studies we're Eagles so we we we can't even we can't even brother SE we can't even we can't even manufactur us out cuz it's just an uncertain sound that's right but when Eagle food begins to come out and Eagles begin to hear it and receive it then something inside of you says amen glory to God that's right I'm wrong the message is right you got a teachable spirit and it's opening a door into another dimension oh man I love him tonight I wanton you to stand to your feet with us it's Wednesday night and I feel good amen I believe you do too amen I pray okay to Le few thoughts from the word in with you tonight amen I say Lord give me a teachable spirit I say let me be good Grand ground Good Grounds teachable ground Good Grounds ground that can be corrected

it to you one time they they said they didn't want Bethlehem they wanted to put Beth Bethlehem out of the way the reason they did not want Bethlehem was because for years people drove by Bethlehem and

woman preacher got up and she got to holler and shout and run all across the building carrying on brother she said all of a sudden see he looked right at her you know looked right at brother brother
