[7:12] laying crippled and she hadd been
[7:13] crippled in the bed 17 years since this
[7:16] girl was
[7:18] born and uh so the girl was 17 years old
[7:22] and so I told her that she said are you
[7:25] that man of God that healed that man I
[7:27] said no ma'am I'm not a Healer
[7:29] I just um just merely um um uh pray for
[7:34] the this sick man was showed by
[7:36] something it told me I didn't know what
[7:38] to call it a vision or what I didn't
[7:39] know what it was yet I was just a boy
[7:42] and single and everything and so there
[7:44] was um this um this lady asked me for
[7:49] prayer for her and I told her let me
[7:52] pray first and then if the Lord showed
[7:54] me to come back and then when I went out

[7:58] that's that woman woman that I I was
[8:00] telling you that I prayed about I know
[8:01] it's the same woman go with me and we

[8:13] about six eight years old something like
[8:16] that and there's a Christmas tree is
[8:18] right after Christmas standing in the
[8:19] house and they got behind this Christmas
[8:21] tree to laugh at me to make their mother
[8:23] well I told her that the Lord was going
[8:25] to heal her and I brother George and I
[8:28] got out to pray and when I started to
[8:30] pray well that angel that I see that
[8:34] that you see in the picture I seen it
[8:35] hanging over the bed well I reached over
[8:38] and Tuck a hold of her hand and I said
[8:40] Mrs OHA now she lives in New Aly right
[8:43] now and her husband and family and I
[8:46] said Mrs
[8:48] ohanna the Lord Jesus has sent me and
[8:51] told me before coming that to pray for
[8:53] you and you just go be made well rise up
[8:56] on your feet and be made well in the
[8:58] name of Jesus her legs was draw up under
[9:01] she with her Armenian Bible over her
[9:04] heart started moving towards the side of
[9:06] the
[9:07] bed and as she did she uh then Satan
[9:10] spoke to me said you let her hit that
[9:13] floor she'll break her neck off that
[9:14] High bed I was scared for a moment and
[9:18] I'd always know that what them Visions I
[9:21] didn't know what it was then had told me
[9:23] was always right so I went ahead anyhow
[9:26] let her come off the bed and God being
[9:28] my witness
[9:29] as soon as she started jump from that
[9:31] bed both legs come straight her daughter
[9:34] screamed pulling her hair and running
[9:36] out into the street screaming as loud as
[9:37] she could Neighbors come from everywhere
[9:40] and there she was for the first time for
[9:42] 17 years walking around in that room
[9:45] praising God I left immediately to get
[9:47] away from it later I got acquainted with
[9:50] this young girl and went with her of
[9:51] course this don't have to be on record
[9:53] but I went with the young girl uh not
[9:55] long after that uh few weeks I was
[9:59] in my mother's house one evening and um
[10:03] I've been praying that day and I I just
[10:05] simply couldn't seem to break through to
[10:09] uh to uh uh victory in my prayer and uh
[10:14] I thought I just stay all you know go
[10:16] ahead to bed I staying at home at that
[10:18] time and so I went into the the room to
[10:23] to pray and I was about 1:00 in the
[10:26] morning I guess and I uh prayed and all
[10:30] at once the I looked and mama she used
[10:33] to take her clothes just pile them in a
[10:34] chair you know we were real poor people
[10:36] and I looked something white coming to
[10:38] me and I thought I was looking at that
[10:39] chair clothed but it's that angel of the
[10:41] Lord that that cloud you know and it
[10:44] come over to where I was and

[1:22:28] anything for us again if he never
[1:22:30] answers another prayer and we all know
[1:22:31] he's answered our prayers but if he
[1:22:34] never does any of that he's still worthy
[1:22:36] of our
[1:22:37] worship amen and I hope that he has left
[1:22:41] an imprint on our heart so deep that no
[1:22:45] matter how dark the night may get the

[1:26:00] this morning we feel your presence here

[1:26:07] ask now that you wouldd anoint the
[1:26:09] speaking of your word as well as the
[1:26:11] hearing in Jesus Christ's name and the
[1:26:15] church
[1:26:16] says amen and
[1:26:18] amen habac uh We've read this here and
[1:26:23] you all know it I'm sure by heart but uh
[1:26:26] chapter 2 and one
[1:26:30] um we will um start there I will stand
[1:26:34] upon my watch and set me upon the tower
[1:26:38] and will watch to see what he will say
[1:26:41] unto me and what I shall answer when I
[1:26:43] am
[1:26:44] reproved and the Lord answered me and
[1:26:48] said write the vision and make it plain
[1:26:51] upon tables that he may run that readeth
[1:26:53] it for the vision is yet for an
[1:26:56] appointed time but at the end it shall
[1:26:58] speak and not lie and though it t wait
[1:27:02] for it because it shall it it will
[1:27:05] surely uh come and it will not
[1:27:10] t amen then uh uh Revelations the 10th
[1:27:15] chapter uh this is a personal scripture
[1:27:18] for
[1:27:19] us and uh we should see it as that and
[1:27:23] take comfort and knowing that we're part
[1:27:25] of
[1:27:26] iten uh Revelations the 10th
[1:27:31] chapter
[1:27:34] and our faith should be built upon
[1:27:36] scripture shouldn't
[1:27:38] it upon the promises of
[1:27:41] God and um so Revelations 10 and eight
[1:27:47] and I and the voice which I heard from
[1:27:49] Heaven spake unto me again saying go
[1:27:51] take go and take the little book which
[1:27:54] is open in the hand of the Angel which
[1:27:56] standeth upon the sea and upon the Earth
[1:27:59] and I went unto the angel and said unto
[1:28:02] him give me the little book and he said
[1:28:03] unto me take it and eat it up and it
[1:28:06] shall make thy belly bitter but it shall
[1:28:10] be in thy mouth sweet as honey and I
[1:28:12] took the little book out of the Angel's
[1:28:14] hand and ate it up and it was in my
[1:28:17] mouth sweet as honey and as soon as I
[1:28:21] had eaten it my belly was bitter and he
[1:28:23] said unto me thou must prophesy again
[1:28:26] before many peoples Nations tongues and
[1:28:29] Kings amen you can have your seats this
[1:28:33] morning
[1:28:35] and I want to just speak about the
[1:28:39] vision and um I guess I titled it uh the
[1:28:43] vision shall speak and many many sermons
[1:28:47] have
[1:28:48] been uh preached uh about
[1:28:52] these two
[1:28:53] scriptures and um so really I'm not
[1:28:57] saying anything new to you and don't
[1:29:01] Endeavor to try I guess um but we we
[1:29:06] want to just uh
[1:29:09] maybe
[1:29:11] uh you know uh uh reaffirm I guess bring
[1:29:15] to our remembrance of what the vision is
[1:29:19] and what God has done
[1:29:23] and uh you know if if a vision comes
[1:29:26] from God then then we take it as thus
[1:29:31] sayith the Lord if if if it is because
[1:29:34] then it is God speaking and if it is God
[1:29:38] speaking then the vision is sure it's
[1:29:42] it's it cannot fail it must come to pass
[1:29:45] brother Brandon was so sure of visions
[1:29:48] that he had received uh that he uh he he
[1:29:52] even said you know that if if he were to
[1:29:56] if God was to speak to him by Vision
[1:30:00] that George Washington was going to
[1:30:02] raise from the dead he uh tomorrow at
[1:30:05] 2:00 or whatever he said I'd invite the
[1:30:08] whole world bring your chairs and come
[1:30:11] and and watch it be fulfilled he said
[1:30:13] because it it it cannot fail because
[1:30:17] it's of God ain't that right I had uh
[1:30:20] asked them to play a
[1:30:22] uh uh uh tape of brother Brandon just
[1:30:25] talking about visions that he had I was
[1:30:27] listening to him this morning and just
[1:30:29] really inspired by them and and maybe
[1:30:33] things that we had heard but uh before
[1:30:37] uh but brother leil had asked him to do
[1:30:39] a recording on just certain on on
[1:30:42] Visions so brother Bram took 35 minutes
[1:30:45] I think of talking about them and uh but
[1:30:49] he talked about of the Armenian woman
[1:30:52] who had been crippled and laid in bed
[1:30:54] her legs were were uh uh folded under
[1:30:58] her and she laid in bed for 17
[1:31:01] years and uh uh so uh he he had come to
[1:31:06] the house because of uh he was working
[1:31:09] on the utility company and and so he was
[1:31:12] checking the electric and things and so
[1:31:15] uh the the her daughter uh noticed him
[1:31:19] and recognized him he was just a young
[1:31:21] man at that time single and and uh and
[1:31:25] so he wasn't World known but uh a
[1:31:28] certain thing had happened to just a few
[1:31:30] days ago that caused issues in the
[1:31:33] hospital uh a man was dying and he went
[1:31:35] in there uh the man had been totally
[1:31:37] crushed it was a a black man and he had
[1:31:40] gotten ran over by a car and he just he
[1:31:44] all of his bones were broken and brother
[1:31:46] brandham had a vision of him and went in
[1:31:48] there and had the man to get up and and
[1:31:51] it just callused the Ruckus in the
[1:31:53] hospital doctors like no way ran him out
[1:31:56] ran brother brand him out and uh but the
[1:31:59] man uh was running a fever of 104 and
[1:32:03] and the fever broke and the man got up
[1:32:06] and despite what the doctor said and got
[1:32:08] and walked out brother brandom said I
[1:32:10] waited for him out of the hospital for
[1:32:12] him to walk out because that's what the
[1:32:14] vision had to him and so it had caused a
[1:32:17] lot of ruckus in town and so when he
[1:32:20] went up to this door this little this
[1:32:22] young lady uh uh said you know are you
[1:32:25] that man and are you the Healer and he
[1:32:28] said well I'm not a Healer and he said
[1:32:30] well my mom wants to talk to you and so
[1:32:32] he went in and talked to this lady and
[1:32:34] she says can I walk and and he said well
[1:32:37] I don't know he said i' God have to show
[1:32:39] me well he left and and he saw a vision
[1:32:43] of that woman so he went and got uh uh
[1:32:47] young convert that he had led to the
[1:32:48] Lord Brother George di I believe and and
[1:32:51] and they went and uh he prayed for her
[1:32:54] and he said thus say the Lord he said I
[1:32:56] saw a vision of you you're going to walk
[1:32:57] he said now get out of that bed and and
[1:33:01] and he he says that she with her
[1:33:03] Armenian Bible over her heart started
[1:33:06] moving towards the side of the bed and
[1:33:08] as she did he says Satan spoke to me and
[1:33:12] said you let her hit that floor she'll
[1:33:14] break her neck off that High bed and he
[1:33:17] said I got scared for a moment yeah but
[1:33:20] then he says but I had always know that
[1:33:23] what them Vision he said now I didn't
[1:33:25] know it was a vision then see he said
[1:33:27] but what them Visions had told me was
[1:33:30] always right so I went ahead and let her
[1:33:34] come off the bed anyhow in other words
[1:33:37] he didn't restrict her from fulfilling
[1:33:40] the vision he let her go ahead and
[1:33:42] fulfill the vision she had to fulfill
[1:33:45] the vision the vision said she going to
[1:33:47] walk so he couldn't even let his own
[1:33:50] fear that sat was trying to bring in him
[1:33:53] let restrict her from fulfilling what
[1:33:56] the vision had already said and he said
[1:33:58] and God being my witness as soon as she
[1:34:01] started she jumped from that bed and
[1:34:04] both legs come straight see because the
[1:34:08] vision had to be fulfilled if it was
[1:34:11] just brother brandham saying it that's
[1:34:13] one thing but the vision he already saw
[1:34:17] her healed and so he had to act upon the
[1:34:21] vision he was telling her according to
[1:34:23] the vision get out of that bed ain't
[1:34:25] that right see so so anything that is
[1:34:30] part of the vision it must it it it has
[1:34:33] to be there in order for the vision to
[1:34:36] be fulfilled brother bradam talked of
[1:34:38] the vision of seeing that little boy uh
[1:34:41] man had come to his house again early in
[1:34:44] the ministry and his ministry and and
[1:34:47] and and said you know uh brother Brandon
[1:34:50] I'm backslid and he i' just murdered or
[1:34:53] I'd murdered a boy a man and uh uh got
[1:34:56] in a fight and broke his neck and things
[1:34:58] like that and he says I've suffered a
[1:35:00] lot of lot of troubles and things he
[1:35:02] said my one of my boys have already died
[1:35:05] he said now my little boy three-year-old
[1:35:07] boy is dying and I think he was three
[1:35:10] and and uh said could you could you come
[1:35:12] and and and have prayer and so brother
[1:35:15] brandham went but he had a vision of
[1:35:18] that boy he had a vision of that boy uh
[1:35:22] living and and here is when he got there
[1:35:25] the boy was just barely breathing and
[1:35:27] just very shallow and but but in this
[1:35:31] Vision he saw other people in the vision
[1:35:34] in that room he saw a certain his hat or
[1:35:37] a man's hat or his hat or something like
[1:35:40] that laying right there he saw an
[1:35:41] elderly woman sitting in a certain place
[1:35:44] she had put her maybe it was her hat or
[1:35:46] her coat or her something there and and
[1:35:49] he saw another brother Graham snailing
[1:35:52] that hadn't even been preaching at that
[1:35:53] time uh saw him sitting in a certain
[1:35:57] certain uh place in the room and all
[1:35:59] that but brother brandham got ahead of
[1:36:01] the vision and he went and prayed for
[1:36:04] that boy and the boy got worse and he's
[1:36:06] like oh no what what's going on then he
[1:36:08] realized that not everybody in the
[1:36:11] vision is is there the the the
[1:36:13] grandmother wasn't there Grand Snelling
[1:36:15] wasn't sitting where he's supposed to be
[1:36:17] in other words not no one was position
[1:36:20] what the vision had said and so he
[1:36:23] started to worry and you all know the
[1:36:25] story but as as brother uh uh uh Graham
[1:36:30] he's getting ready to go for work and
[1:36:32] and and so brother Graham's like oh no
[1:36:34] what do I do so they asked well do do we
[1:36:36] want you want to go on home and he said
[1:36:38] no he said I'll just stay right here and
[1:36:41] and as they were getting ready to leave
[1:36:43] that that elderly woman he uh come up
[1:36:47] and walked into the house and he says
[1:36:49] there it is you know we needed her and
[1:36:53] and he says I got up out of the seat
[1:36:55] because she's supposed to be sitting
[1:36:56] where I'm supposed to be sitting so he
[1:36:58] got up and he moved and watched her put
[1:37:00] the hat or put whatever she needed to
[1:37:03] put went over there and sat down in that
[1:37:05] spot and then brother Graham Snelly he
[1:37:07] said I had to wait for him and he went
[1:37:09] over there and sat down in the spot in
[1:37:12] in the in the other place and everything
[1:37:14] was according to the vision and then he
[1:37:17] says now he said now do you believe me
[1:37:19] still to be a a of God and all these
[1:37:22] things yes brother Brandon and he went
[1:37:24] and prayed and that boy got up and
[1:37:26] walked and and and he says now he went
[1:37:29] back and he told his church he says now
[1:37:31] you wait he says I'm going to go over
[1:37:33] there and and he says he said I want all
[1:37:36] of y'all to go and he says y'all stand
[1:37:38] there and watch he's that little boy
[1:37:40] when when I come into that room that
[1:37:42] little boy is going to say look brother
[1:37:44] brandom I can walk or something to that
[1:37:46] effect and he invited his whole church
[1:37:48] they loaded up in cars and and and truck
[1:37:51] trucks and they all gathered around the
[1:37:52] house looking in the windows and he
[1:37:54] walked in there and and and he shook the
[1:37:58] the the mom's hand and all that and here
[1:38:00] come he goes she goes well look here's
[1:38:02] brother brandom and here come that
[1:38:04] three-year-old little kid walking up Hey
[1:38:06] brother brandom look I can walk see it
[1:38:09] was all according to the vision the
[1:38:13] vision was so certain ain't that right
[1:38:16] and the vision could not be fulfilled
[1:38:18] until everyone was possessed Al placed
[1:38:22] in in in what that was in or part of the
[1:38:26] vision ain't that right brother brandom
[1:38:28] talks of another time of of uh having a
[1:38:32] vision of a girl uh uh that had needen
[1:38:35] prayer and and he saw her walking but he
[1:38:38] didn't know where she lived and he knew
[1:38:41] the vicinity of the place uh the mother
[1:38:44] had mailed him a letter and uh asking
[1:38:48] him to come he saw the vision and and so
[1:38:51] but he really didn't know where she
[1:38:52] lived and and so there was some people
[1:38:55] that he invited to come and he says they
[1:38:57] were all crammed in the car you know uh
[1:39:00] uh the women were sitting on one
[1:39:01] another's laps and and here they go down
[1:39:04] the road and he knew it was in a certain
[1:39:06] place and and and and so he told him he
[1:39:09] says but he said now in the vision there
[1:39:11] was a man and and he says now he says
[1:39:15] see uh he saw a a a yellow store and he
[1:39:18] says and they passed it he goes now
[1:39:19] there's that yellow front store he says
[1:39:21] now he says now you watch he said a man
[1:39:24] is going to come out of there with a
[1:39:26] blue overalls on a white yellow quarter
[1:39:31] cap with a white mustache and he's going
[1:39:33] to tell me where to go and he said and
[1:39:36] if he doesn't do that he says then I'm a
[1:39:38] biggest Storyteller well they passed it
[1:39:41] and there he and there comes the man he
[1:39:44] walks right out got the mustache got the
[1:39:47] cap got the overalls everything to
[1:39:49] describe one he says one sister fainted
[1:39:52] uh right then in the car and and he
[1:39:55] stops and and he he uh uh uh uh stops
[1:40:00] and he tells that man notice what he
[1:40:02] tells that man he didn't ask that man
[1:40:04] for direction he said sir you're are to
[1:40:07] tell me where Harold nail uh is and he
[1:40:12] said yes sir did you come from the south
[1:40:13] he said I did he said well you passed it
[1:40:15] a half mile down the road so he begins
[1:40:18] to tell him he said you find a big red
[1:40:19] barn now brother Bram described the
[1:40:21] house to to to the the people that were
[1:40:24] with him he said it's on your second H
[1:40:27] second house on your right and da d da
[1:40:29] and he said why are you wanting to know
[1:40:31] he said well he's got a Afflicted
[1:40:32] daughter see doesn't he and he said yes
[1:40:35] sir he does I said well the Lord is
[1:40:37] going to heal her and the old man
[1:40:38] started crying see he never knew so he
[1:40:42] was included in the vision and yet he
[1:40:45] didn't even know what was going on but
[1:40:48] the vision he didn't have to know the
[1:40:51] vision already declared him the vision
[1:40:54] already showed what he would do ain't
[1:40:57] that right see the vision it's it's so
[1:41:00] powerful the vision now you know uh uh
[1:41:04] the vision that the the prophet uh habac
[1:41:08] I guess uh is speaking of is God's
[1:41:10] Vision God had a vision uh of what he
[1:41:14] had in his mind as we know and and
[1:41:16] because of his infinite knowledge he
[1:41:19] could foretell the end from the
[1:41:21] beginning and Acts 15:18 says known unto
[1:41:25] God are all of his works from the
[1:41:27] beginning of the world so this Vision
[1:41:30] existed in God's mind and it it it it
[1:41:34] and and and he didn't leave it there he
[1:41:37] didn't just leave it there but he
[1:41:39] expressed this Vision in word he
[1:41:42] expressed it in word uh uh and and then
[1:41:46] of course uh he wanted the vision to
[1:41:48] come to pass and so it could couldn't
[1:41:51] come to pass as long as it was in his
[1:41:53] mind as a as a thought it had to be
[1:41:56] expressed in the word and when it was
[1:41:58] expressed in the word now now brother
[1:42:01] brandom already told us that the vision
[1:42:03] was already it wasn't a wish it wasn't a
[1:42:06] hope it wasn't a just a plan it was a
[1:42:09] reality it was as though it was already
[1:42:12] done in God's mind because it was
[1:42:15] eternal it's a vision ain't that right
[1:42:18] and so uh uh uh but it wouldn't come to
[1:42:21] pass in in into a reality form unless it
[1:42:26] was expressed in word but the Bible
[1:42:29] tells us that we were part of that
[1:42:31] Vision amen and to think of this amen uh
[1:42:35] and we know the scripture but Ephesians
[1:42:37] 1 and4 according as Heath chosen Us in
[1:42:40] him before the foundation of the world
[1:42:43] and and this means that we were with him
[1:42:47] in the mind and thoughts of God before
[1:42:50] the foundation of the world and brother
[1:42:52] BR says that gives an eternal quality to
[1:42:57] the elect can you say Amen that that
[1:43:00] gives an eternal quality to the elect
[1:43:03] and you cannot get away from that you
[1:43:06] you can and and so Paul would go on even
[1:43:10] as as in his love he chose us in other
[1:43:14] words he actually picked us out for
[1:43:17] himself as his own and that right in
[1:43:22] Christ before the foundation of the
[1:43:24] world that we should be holy consecrated
[1:43:27] set apart for him and blameless in his
[1:43:31] sight even uh even uh as one translation
[1:43:37] above reproach before him in love ain't
[1:43:40] that right so we were to be above
[1:43:42] reproach this is what the vision speaks
[1:43:45] of us we were chosen in him with him in
[1:43:48] him in love ain't that right chosen to
[1:43:52] be for his own amen see I I think it it
[1:43:57] it it's encouraging to know what what
[1:43:59] the vision does speak of us amen but see
[1:44:03] a genuine Christian is an eternal
[1:44:06] thought of God brother Brown said the
[1:44:08] bride was already in his mind she
[1:44:11] already existed in his mind so she's not
[1:44:15] just coming into existence now but she
[1:44:19] had already EX existed ain't that right
[1:44:22] it was the vision amen see and and so
[1:44:26] she was existing in his thoughts you
[1:44:28] know as we we know brother brandom tells
[1:44:31] us and the Bible tells us that God has
[1:44:33] never had a new thought about anything
[1:44:36] brother Bram said all of his thoughts uh
[1:44:38] he has always had and always will have
[1:44:42] and knows the end from the beginning
[1:44:43] because he's God thus the thoughts of
[1:44:46] God are Eternal and they are real see
[1:44:50] they're not simply like a man with the
[1:44:51] blueprint he is drawn up at which one
[1:44:54] day will be translated into substance
[1:44:56] and form but they already real and
[1:45:00] eternal and part of God so God's not
[1:45:03] just drawing something up it's real can
[1:45:06] you say Amen it's a reality so then
[1:45:10] being an eternal thought of God makes
[1:45:12] you part of God Amen aren't you glad for
[1:45:15] that so then no matter how little you
[1:45:17] may seem and what little part you play
[1:45:19] in in in in in whatever in in life if
[1:45:23] you're part of the vision then you are
[1:45:26] important and the vision could not be
[1:45:28] fulfilled until you came and and and the
[1:45:31] Rapture can't happen until everything is
[1:45:35] just right I believe that God knows
[1:45:37] every individual that'll be in that
[1:45:40] Rapture I I just believe that amen not
[1:45:43] not is he just throwing it out there
[1:45:44] that there's going to be a Rapture and
[1:45:46] there's going to be a changing of the
[1:45:47] body and and not only does he say we
[1:45:51] which are alive as though it's just you
[1:45:53] know uh thrown in general but God knows
[1:45:56] every individual that that speaks of do
[1:46:00] you believe that and it could not happen
[1:46:03] it could not happen in 63 it could not H
[1:46:05] because I wasn't there in ' 63 it
[1:46:08] couldn't happen in 70 uh or whatever
[1:46:11] because I wasn't there yet you
[1:46:13] understand what I'm saying and and
[1:46:15] sometimes we wonder God why is it taken
[1:46:17] so long for this to happen maybe God
[1:46:20] waiting for that little one to come Amen
[1:46:23] to prove his word if because if they're
[1:46:26] part of the vision that everyone is
[1:46:28] going to be there and not one is going
[1:46:30] to be left behind do you believe that
[1:46:33] amen see a vision can be very dist uh
[1:46:36] descriptive amen not just thrown in
[1:46:39] general but it could tell the color of
[1:46:40] hair it could tell I mean it tell it
[1:46:42] brother Brandon would see you know
[1:46:44] talking to a patient in the prayer line
[1:46:46] and describe the doctor to a tea because
[1:46:49] that's what a vision can do ain't that
[1:46:51] right when the vision is shown then it
[1:46:53] has to be exactly right on target do you
[1:46:58] believe that or not amen see so then we
[1:47:02] we find that you're just as much as
[1:47:04] important to God in the vision as maybe
[1:47:08] the Evangelist that that that P that
[1:47:10] travels the world over amen and and and
[1:47:14] maybe he's doing his part and
[1:47:16] everybody's doing their part and but it
[1:47:18] couldn't happen the rapture cannot take
[1:47:21] place amen until every individual no
[1:47:25] matter how young no matter how little
[1:47:27] the job or whatever no one can take your
[1:47:29] place so then if you're an eternal
[1:47:32] thought of God then God can never take
[1:47:35] you out of his memory can you say Amen
[1:47:39] you you're here by a
[1:47:42] vision do you believe that you're here
[1:47:45] by a vision it's one thing for brother
[1:47:48] brandom you know brother brandom
[1:47:49] sometime with telling you now if I never
[1:47:51] saw a vision of that individual I'd pray
[1:47:53] but and just tell them well just you
[1:47:55] know go on but if it's a vision then
[1:47:57] it's got to happen that's the difference
[1:48:00] can you say man I'm not here trying to
[1:48:02] build you a hope there is a vision
[1:48:05] behind this there's a vision behind this
[1:48:08] message can you say man this message is
[1:48:11] going to work it's it's it's taking a
[1:48:14] hold of somebody because it's a
[1:48:18] vision it's a vision
[1:48:21] that's why you don't need Psychology you
[1:48:23] just need the
[1:48:25] message it's it's a there's a vision
[1:48:28] here can you say amen and God can never
[1:48:31] stop thinking of you do you believe that
[1:48:34] true amen for you're an eternal thought
[1:48:37] amen that is now baptized into the body
[1:48:40] of Christ to be expressed amen so if
[1:48:43] brother R you know talked about how that
[1:48:45] God always had his thoughts for Adam but
[1:48:48] as as the thought of God God yet he was
[1:48:52] uh uh he was yet unexpressed see as the
[1:48:55] thought of God he was as yet unexpressed
[1:48:59] and and and then brother Brandon gives
[1:49:01] the scripture Psalms 139 15 starting it
[1:49:05] says my substance was not hid from thee
[1:49:07] when I was made in secret and curiously
[1:49:10] wrought in the lowest parts of the earth
[1:49:12] Thine Eyes did see my stuff yet being
[1:49:15] unperfect and and in thy book all my
[1:49:18] members were written and which in
[1:49:21] continuance were
[1:49:22] fashioned when as yet there was none of
[1:49:25] them how precious also are thy thoughts
[1:49:28] unto me oh God how great is the sum of
[1:49:31] them ain't that right now brother BR
[1:49:33] says even though this was not written of
[1:49:35] Adam yet it still gives us an idea and
[1:49:37] knowledge that the thought was there in
[1:49:41] the mind of God Amen you were there in
[1:49:45] the mind of God see so then a a true
[1:49:49] vision is thus say the Lord to the
[1:49:51] people amen and and and then it becomes
[1:49:55] God's promise Amen to us because it will
[1:49:58] never fail it shall come to pass and and
[1:50:01] therefore it is the absolute do you
[1:50:04] believe that amen it is our absolute it
[1:50:07] was an absolute to brother brandham was
[1:50:09] it not Amen to that woman that that he's
[1:50:12] laid there 17 years and Satan was trying
[1:50:14] to put it in his mind that she going to
[1:50:16] break her neck if she gets off that but
[1:50:17] the vision became an absolute
[1:50:20] Amen to him to where that he knew that
[1:50:23] if she would get up amen God would
[1:50:26] sustain her that's what the vision said
[1:50:30] ain't that right that's what the vision
[1:50:32] said amen so if God said I can do it
[1:50:35] then I can do it if God says you can do
[1:50:38] it you can do it ain't that right if
[1:50:39] he's called you to do something then you
[1:50:41] can do it don't say you can't do it God
[1:50:43] said you can do it amen it's according
[1:50:45] to the vision can you say Amen if he
[1:50:48] ordained that I should bring forth fruit
[1:50:50] and that my fruit should remain there's
[1:50:53] nothing going to stop that that's what
[1:50:55] I'm I'm called to do exactly a ain't
[1:50:58] that right it's going to be that way
[1:50:59] it's a perfect vision now Vision uh uh
[1:51:03] refers to spiritual enlightenment and
[1:51:07] insight into Divine things vision and
[1:51:11] this word Enlightenment is to furnish
[1:51:14] knowledge to illuminate to give Spirit
[1:51:18] insight to see so so so here here is
[1:51:22] what the the Paul uh Apostle Paul in
[1:51:25] Ephesians 1:16 said I cease not to give
[1:51:29] thanks for you making mention of you in
[1:51:31] my prayer that the god of our Lord Jesus
[1:51:33] Christ the father of Glory may give unto
[1:51:35] you the spirit of wisdom and Revelation
[1:51:38] in the knowledge of him ain't that right
[1:51:41] the eyes of your understanding being
[1:51:44] enlightened ain't that right so he's
[1:51:46] praying that we would catch the
[1:51:48] vision and ain't that right catch the
[1:51:51] vision amen see that you may know what
[1:51:54] is the hope of his calling and what the
[1:51:56] riches of the glory of his inheritance
[1:51:58] in the Saints what is the exceeding
[1:52:00] greatness God wants us to know what
[1:52:03] these things are for us he wants to know
[1:52:06] what the inheritance his inheritance is
[1:52:09] he wants us to know the hope of his
[1:52:11] calling he wants to know us to know what
[1:52:14] is the exceeding greatness of his power
[1:52:17] to us word who believe according to the
[1:52:19] work of his mighty power ain't that
[1:52:21] right now now I believe that this
[1:52:23] scripture was was fulfilled uh uh well
[1:52:27] well we'll put it this way goes in line
[1:52:29] with the opening of the book Because
[1:52:32] when this is what happened to John when
[1:52:35] the book became open he saw himself in
[1:52:39] the vision ain't that right he saw
[1:52:42] himself in the vision brother R said he
[1:52:45] must have saw his name there ain't that
[1:52:47] right so so then then you you look at 1
[1:52:50] Samuel 3:1 and the child Samuel
[1:52:54] ministered unto the Lord before Eli and
[1:52:57] the word of the Lord was precious in
[1:52:59] those days very rare in those days
[1:53:04] because there was no open Vision ain't
[1:53:08] that right so hearing the word of the
[1:53:10] Lord amen uh the voice of the Lord
[1:53:13] connecting with the vision amen it it it
[1:53:17] it was rare because the the hearing of
[1:53:20] the voice of the Lord was rare in that
[1:53:23] day and and there there were many just
[1:53:26] like it is today there were many other
[1:53:28] voices sounding out that was drowning
[1:53:30] out the voice of God Amen and so uh uh
[1:53:34] because of this there was no open Vision
[1:53:37] uh the voice of God was silent see and
[1:53:40] and so then then uh uh uh if there's no
[1:53:45] open Vision then there's no knowledge
[1:53:48] but Paul is saying I pray pray that the
[1:53:51] eyes of your understanding would be
[1:53:53] enlightened that that you that the this
[1:53:56] revelation of the knowledge of God would
[1:53:59] come to you amen see amen but but there
[1:54:03] had to be an open Vision ain't that
[1:54:05] right see when we speak of vision we're
[1:54:07] speaking of the knowledge of the Lord
[1:54:10] amen it's it's something that is is man
[1:54:13] cannot have on his own uh uh it's just
[1:54:16] like when the Lord asked um uh uh
[1:54:21] Ezekiel the prophet there when he's
[1:54:22] looking at this valley of dry bones are
[1:54:24] scattered all over the valley and he
[1:54:26] asks ask Ezekiel can these bones live
[1:54:30] and the prophet asked answered the right
[1:54:33] way thou knowest right thou knowest he
[1:54:36] didn't know if they could live it was
[1:54:38] too despairing it was a condition that
[1:54:41] would just looked too impossible but see
[1:54:44] he just needed a word from God and when
[1:54:47] he got the word from God he can act upon
[1:54:51] the word of God ain't that right but
[1:54:53] just within himself amen who is he to
[1:54:56] say ain't that right amen see so with
[1:55:00] the vision we're we're speaking of the
[1:55:02] knowledge of the Lord uh The Book of
[1:55:05] Proverbs actually tells us to find the
[1:55:07] knowledge of God find the knowledge of
[1:55:10] God also it says he says out of the
[1:55:13] mouth of God cometh knowledge and
[1:55:17] understanding see so if the voice of God
[1:55:20] isn't speaking then the vision isn't
[1:55:23] being made known see the vision must
[1:55:27] speak can you say Amen the vision has to
[1:55:31] be declared it has to be made known see
[1:55:35] and and and I want to say it this way
[1:55:36] not just in voice not as it just made
[1:55:39] known in voice but also in
[1:55:42] manifestation ain't that right amen for
[1:55:45] for uh the angel told Brother brandham
[1:55:48] your your your life speaks louder than
[1:55:51] your words can you say am man your life
[1:55:54] now notice uh and and hopefully making
[1:55:58] sense a little bit but brother brandham
[1:56:00] talks about the three-fold purpose of
[1:56:02] God and and this this to me has to do
[1:56:05] with the vision of God Amen the
[1:56:08] three-fold purpose was what first to
[1:56:10] reveal himself in Christ the fullness of
[1:56:13] the godhead bodily ain't that right then
[1:56:18] second part is toing bring that fullness
[1:56:20] of the godhead bodily into a people that
[1:56:25] he could have the preeminence the
[1:56:27] oversight the leading ain't that right
[1:56:29] then thirdly uh the threefold uh third
[1:56:33] part is to restore the kingdom to its
[1:56:36] rightly position that fell by sin by the
[1:56:39] first Adam back to where he walked in
[1:56:41] the cool of the evening with this people
[1:56:44] talked with them and fellowshipped with
[1:56:46] him ain't that right see so the vision
[1:56:50] is being fulfilled now habach uh
[1:56:53] 2:14 it speaks of a time when the Earth
[1:56:57] shall be filled with the knowledge of
[1:57:00] the glory of the Lord as the water cover
[1:57:04] the sea ain't that right so the whole
[1:57:06] earth is going to be filled with this
[1:57:09] knowledge of the Lord and and it doesn't
[1:57:12] mean that that the preachers are going
[1:57:14] to rise up and the singers are going to
[1:57:16] rise up and they're going to start
[1:57:18] preaching and evangelizing ring and and
[1:57:20] and and the singers are going to sing
[1:57:22] and the testifiers testify that's not
[1:57:25] where that's not the knowledge that he's
[1:57:27] speaking of uh but this knowledge
[1:57:31] feeling the the Earth amen is actually
[1:57:35] the vision coming to its
[1:57:39] manifestation the vision coming to its
[1:57:43] full
[1:57:44] entire
[1:57:46] manifestation can you say Amen of what
[1:57:48] God had in his mind the knowledge of the
[1:57:52] Lord the knowledge amen see amen uh uh
[1:57:56] uh we we we think of it right now
[1:57:59] preachers are preaching we had a prophet
[1:58:01] uh speak and there there's the tapes and
[1:58:03] all that that is revealing the knowledge
[1:58:05] of God Amen revealing the mind of God to
[1:58:09] us ain't that right but then the
[1:58:11] knowledge is getting more real to us
[1:58:14] it's like the Shadow and and and the
[1:58:16] hand you know as it's coming close
[1:58:19] Closer Closer close it's coming to a
[1:58:22] greater knowledge until the Shadow and
[1:58:24] the Hand become one ain't that right
[1:58:27] well see we we find amen that this
[1:58:30] knowledge of the Lord that's going to
[1:58:31] fill the Earth brother bradam says this
[1:58:34] this is when the enemy has been put away
[1:58:37] the end of sin has come the bringing in
[1:58:40] of an everlasting righteousness has come
[1:58:43] Satan is sealed up in the bottomless pit
[1:58:46] and the knowledge of the Lord shall
[1:58:48] cover the Waters cover the sea amen or
[1:58:52] or as the waters covers the sea see
[1:58:55] glory to God it's coming brother it's
[1:58:58] coming women will be ladies men will be
[1:59:02] gentlemen No More Tears no more sorrow
[1:59:06] no more pain no more Agony no more
[1:59:09] loneliness no more mind battles no no
[1:59:13] more struggles why God never had that
[1:59:17] part in his vision amen he saw a bride
[1:59:20] perfected he saw a bride living with him
[1:59:24] he saw a peaceful Reign he saw an
[1:59:26] everlasting rain he saw a people that
[1:59:29] was Triumph amen that death could not
[1:59:32] bother anymore corruption sickness and
[1:59:35] all these things see it's a knowledge
[1:59:37] that we're coming to even greater and
[1:59:40] greater and greater amen praise the Lord
[1:59:43] say so there will be nothing to Cloud
[1:59:45] the vision contradict the vision and all
[1:59:48] these things a ain't that right now
[1:59:50] notice in Proverbs 29 and 18 it says
[1:59:54] where there's no vision the people
[1:59:57] perish amen we could take that in a lot
[1:59:59] of ways but the the strong concordance
[2:00:03] says where there is no prophecy the
[2:00:05] people perish now let me ask you what
[2:00:08] future do we have if there's no vision
[2:00:11] what what hope do we have in this life
[2:00:13] if there if there is no vision if if H
[2:00:17] how can a man TR truly have genuine
[2:00:20] peace in a time of
[2:00:23] turbulence if there is no vision can you
[2:00:27] say Amen so you know I mean did did God
[2:00:30] Save Us only for us to be lost in the
[2:00:32] end not according to the vision did did
[2:00:36] God uh go with us all the way and then
[2:00:39] one of these days he's just going to
[2:00:41] leave us and forsake us I I I not
[2:00:44] according to the vision see see there's
[2:00:46] a vision that that God is working
[2:00:49] working in ain't that right amen did did
[2:00:52] God protect us all these years only to
[2:00:54] leave us annihilated at the end not
[2:00:57] according to the vision can you say Amen
[2:01:00] see see and and and so then because
[2:01:03] there is Vision we hear a message
[2:01:08] Shalom we hear the words that is spoken
[2:01:12] and brother Brandon said I'm speaking to
[2:01:13] the elect now Shalom and yet he didn't
[2:01:17] have to be here
[2:01:19] when you were born he didn't have to be
[2:01:21] here to see the trials that you're going
[2:01:23] through he didn't have to to be here to
[2:01:26] see how more wicked the world is now no
[2:01:29] he saw according to a
[2:01:32] vision he saw a bride already formed he
[2:01:37] saw that bride not going down the eel he
[2:01:39] saw that bride going up and according to
[2:01:43] the vision you're not here to tell him
[2:01:45] everything you're going through but that
[2:01:47] doesn't matter or he's not here here for
[2:01:49] you to tell him these things but it
[2:01:51] doesn't matter you already hear a voice
[2:01:55] Shalom because he had a vision it's a
[2:01:58] vision brother brand spoke according to
[2:02:01] a vision sir did he not amen sure he did
[2:02:05] now we we we're to find this knowledge
[2:02:07] of God we're to come to the knowledge of
[2:02:09] God but we can't do it without an open
[2:02:12] Vision amen see because the vision is so
[2:02:15] far beyond our own ability to understand
[2:02:18] amen Isaiah 558 for my thoughts are not
[2:02:21] your thoughts neither are your ways my
[2:02:23] ways sayith the Lord for as high as the
[2:02:26] heavens are higher than the earth so are
[2:02:27] my ways higher than your ways my
[2:02:29] thoughts higher than your thoughts ain't
[2:02:32] that right then you got here 1
[2:02:34] Corinthians 2:9 Paul says you know I
[2:02:37] have not seen nor ear heard neither has
[2:02:40] been entered into the heart of man the
[2:02:43] things the things the things which God
[2:02:47] ha prepared is he coming up with things
[2:02:50] on a daily basis no it's according to
[2:02:52] the
[2:02:53] vision is it
[2:02:55] not you we we already know that Moses
[2:02:58] patterned the Tabernacle after a vision
[2:03:00] he saw in heaven after a Heavenly
[2:03:03] Tabernacle amen he just caught up in
[2:03:06] that
[2:03:06] Vision yes sir see but God the things
[2:03:10] which God ha prepared for them that love
[2:03:13] him but God hath revealed them to us by
[2:03:16] his
[2:03:17] spirit
[2:03:19] for the spirit searcheth all things yay
[2:03:21] the Deep things of God ain't that right
[2:03:23] amen we never knew by our natural
[2:03:26] understanding we never knew we were part
[2:03:27] of that Vision but we are amen ain't
[2:03:30] that right and look look what the Bible
[2:03:33] says first uh or Psalms 10216 when the
[2:03:36] Lord shall build up Zion he shall appear
[2:03:39] in glory praise the lord it's part of
[2:03:42] the vision that's
[2:03:44] right hell amen and and and
[2:03:49] who is this
[2:03:51] Zion I mean this is in the Old Testament
[2:03:53] this is thousands of years right I
[2:03:56] believe we are that people that he was
[2:03:59] speaking us amen praise the Lord amen to
[2:04:03] God and I believe that Revelations 101
[2:04:07] is part of that
[2:04:08] scripture when he builds up this body
[2:04:12] Zion the bride he himself will come and
[2:04:17] appear in his glory
[2:04:19] hallelujah amen hello sir can you say
[2:04:23] Amen but it's part of a
[2:04:25] vision it wasn't just a man speaking of
[2:04:28] something that prophecy was sure to
[2:04:30] happen and here you are by
[2:04:34] [Music]
[2:04:36] visionen Hallelujah see I believe that's
[2:04:39] speaking of us in this day when he and
[2:04:42] the bride
[2:04:43] unites together in holy Union and they
[2:04:46] become one ain't that right right what
[2:04:49] about 1 Thessalonians 4:16 for the Lord
[2:04:51] himself shall descend from heaven with
[2:04:53] the Shout with the voice of the
[2:04:54] Archangel with the Trump of God and the
[2:04:56] dead in Christ shall rise first then
[2:04:58] which we which are alive and remain
[2:05:00] shall be caught up together with him in
[2:05:01] the clouds to meet the Lord in the air
[2:05:03] and so shall we ever be with the Lord
[2:05:05] wherefore Comfort one of these one
[2:05:07] another with these words can you say
[2:05:09] amen amen and yet we could not
[2:05:12] understand that scripture we could not
[2:05:14] apply that scripture yet it's a vision
[2:05:17] vision it's God's
[2:05:19] Vision can you say Amen but when our
[2:05:23] eyes become
[2:05:25] enlightened we realize that we're living
[2:05:28] in not just a church age we're living in
[2:05:31] a Rapture age it's an age of
[2:05:35] rapture we are the people he was
[2:05:38] speaking
[2:05:39] of Amen all right but see our minds are
[2:05:43] finite our knowledge is limited and our
[2:05:46] knowledge comes from the carnal
[2:05:49] true perverted knowledge so it takes God
[2:05:51] to reveal it first amen now we know the
[2:05:55] scripture but deu Deuteronomy 29:29 the
[2:05:58] secret things belong unto the Lord Our
[2:06:00] God but those things which are revealed
[2:06:03] belong to us ain't that right unto our
[2:06:07] children forever now brother Bram says
[2:06:09] see the word is God and as the word as
[2:06:13] the bridegroom being the word and the
[2:06:15] bride being the hearer of the word they
[2:06:18] come together in a
[2:06:21] union can you say amen amen now what
[2:06:24] what what I I like about that is is is
[2:06:28] that we could not come into a union
[2:06:30] until these things were revealed to
[2:06:34] us can you say Amen the secret things
[2:06:37] belong to the Lord but them things that
[2:06:39] were revealed belong to us can you say
[2:06:44] amen and God had to make it known he's
[2:06:48] made this this Vision known in this last
[2:06:52] day we're not
[2:06:55] poppers we're Sons and Daughters of
[2:06:58] God we're not weak and beggarly we are
[2:07:03] we are this is the time for
[2:07:05] manifestation of sons of God where Sons
[2:07:09] will go back to an authority and I
[2:07:12] believe that that Authority is in us
[2:07:15] today but it had to be revealed to us it
[2:07:18] could not just stay as a thought it
[2:07:21] could not just stay as a as a promise it
[2:07:24] had to be revealed now it belongs to
[2:07:28] you now it belongs it belongs to you it
[2:07:31] belongs to I can you say Amen to me see
[2:07:35] so now they're coming together in a
[2:07:38] union in a union see they unite like a
[2:07:42] wedding see and they're getting ready
[2:07:44] for a wedding they become one right not
[2:07:49] not God in a shadow now becoming
[2:07:53] one can you say Amen not not not just
[2:07:57] we're looking in the scriptures for for
[2:08:00] something now it's becoming a reality he
[2:08:03] says the word becomes you and you become
[2:08:07] the
[2:08:07] word ain't that right the word becomes
[2:08:10] you and you become the
[2:08:13] word now it belongs to you every promise
[2:08:17] in this book is
[2:08:20] mine I don't have to just read it I can
[2:08:22] act upon it I I'm becoming it you're
[2:08:24] becoming
[2:08:26] this you're the vision praise the Lord
[2:08:28] and notice brother Bram said you become
[2:08:31] the word as you receive the word how
[2:08:33] many wants to receive the word God help
[2:08:35] us to receive the word God help us to
[2:08:38] receive the word what if brother Brandon
[2:08:41] would have received what Satan was
[2:08:42] trying to tell him about that woman
[2:08:43] getting off the bed if she gets off that
[2:08:45] bed she going to break her neck but he
[2:08:47] refused to received that he he received
[2:08:50] what God said about
[2:08:52] it amen can you say Amen we can
[2:08:56] understand that we're not receiving a
[2:08:58] words of a man we're receiving a vision
[2:09:02] we're receiving what God had in his mind
[2:09:05] about
[2:09:07] us
[2:09:08] amen yes sir now how does he reveal the
[2:09:12] vision the
[2:09:15] vision Amos 3:7 surely the Lord will do
[2:09:18] nothing but he revealeth his secret unto
[2:09:20] his servants the prophets that's right
[2:09:22] now the Bible tells us that God is not
[2:09:24] an author of confusion that's ain't that
[2:09:27] right I I hope you don't get tired of me
[2:09:30] saying it but you know this is why God
[2:09:32] would send us a
[2:09:34] Prophet this is why we we we you know
[2:09:38] there's good good preachers out there
[2:09:40] there's good you know television
[2:09:43] evangelist and and these things powerful
[2:09:45] men out there that can you know that can
[2:09:47] preach a message and wow it seems so
[2:09:50] good and and all these things but the
[2:09:52] Revelation lays within the message the
[2:09:55] Lord can you say amen I you know uh it's
[2:10:00] not a theologian Vision it's God's
[2:10:03] Vision ain't that right amen that's why
[2:10:07] he could take a seventh grade Kian amen
[2:10:10] and reveal his own Vision because it
[2:10:13] comes through a prophet he didn't need a
[2:10:15] smart man to reveal his vision he didn't
[2:10:18] need a denomination you know
[2:10:20] denominations got their own Vision but
[2:10:23] we are a people that is lining up with
[2:10:26] God's vision and that Vision had to be
[2:10:29] revealed by way of a
[2:10:32] prophet now Prophet means sear he's he's
[2:10:36] one that for Tails forth Tails so
[2:10:39] brother Braham said see notice the
[2:10:40] vision comes to the prophets and it's
[2:10:43] the word of the Lord spoken to them amen
[2:10:46] God gives the true Prophet the true
[2:10:48] vision and he deals with all prophets by
[2:10:52] Vision ain't that right so then we we
[2:10:56] know that this Bible is God's Vision
[2:10:59] amen because 2 Timothy 3:15 all
[2:11:02] scripture is given by inspiration of God
[2:11:06] ain't that right all scripture then then
[2:11:09] first or 2 Timothy 1:20 knowing this
[2:11:12] verse that no Prophecy of the scripture
[2:11:14] is of any private interpretation for the
[2:11:17] prophecy or would say the vision came
[2:11:20] not in Old Time by the will of man but
[2:11:22] holy men of God spoke as they were moved
[2:11:26] by the Holy Ghost so then we know that
[2:11:29] this this Bible is uh man is not the
[2:11:32] author of this Bible God is the author
[2:11:35] of this Bible and it's the vision of God
[2:11:38] that would come that the prophets
[2:11:40] receive so then the prophet said this
[2:11:43] what makes the Bible a different book
[2:11:45] than all the sacred books there are it's
[2:11:47] a book book of Prophecy for telling
[2:11:50] future events it's also the revelation
[2:11:53] of Jesus Christ all the way from Genesis
[2:11:55] to Revelation brings him out in his
[2:12:00] fullness what he was and is can you say
[2:12:04] amen amen so now this this Bible is is a
[2:12:09] vision written by God uh by the prophets
[2:12:14] uh by the vision that they saw but then
[2:12:16] the prophet said the the the all the
[2:12:19] prophets everybody say all the prophets
[2:12:21] spoke of this day all the prophets spoke
[2:12:24] of this day and he says see we're living
[2:12:27] in the in in the greatest time of all
[2:12:30] ages we're now living just at the
[2:12:33] closing of scene of this world's
[2:12:35] activities and fixing to enter into that
[2:12:37] great age that we've looked for for so
[2:12:39] long the Hebrew prophets had spoke of
[2:12:43] through the day yeah so this Vision was
[2:12:47] not just for Isaiah's day it wasn't just
[2:12:49] for Jeremiah but they've actually all of
[2:12:53] them were speaking of this
[2:12:56] day that's why we can get blessed we
[2:12:58] don't want to take anything out of this
[2:13:00] Bible amen can you say Amen brother Ram
[2:13:03] says now the Hebrew prophets the two
[2:13:06] major themes and practically from
[2:13:10] somewhere along in every chapter of the
[2:13:12] Bible from Genesis to Malachi you can
[2:13:15] find one of those subjects being dealt
[2:13:17] with all the way through the Bible the
[2:13:20] coming of the Messiah and the anointing
[2:13:23] and sending forth of the church into all
[2:13:26] the world prise the lord so two themes
[2:13:30] the Messiah and the
[2:13:31] church praise God ain't that
[2:13:35] right and it's spoke of in symbols by
[2:13:39] animals and so forth and like great
[2:13:41] armies and so forth that Marches On and
[2:13:44] runs over the walls and so forth the
[2:13:46] different like Locust
[2:13:48] everything was in symbols and Parables
[2:13:51] straight teachings and everything comes
[2:13:54] down to those two subjects the Messiah
[2:13:57] and the church praise God
[2:14:01] glory amen how sure are you how sure is
[2:14:06] your
[2:14:07] salvation how sure is your
[2:14:10] destiny how sure is your present
[2:14:14] state of where you're at today you're
[2:14:16] not just wandering there's been a
[2:14:19] prophecy
[2:14:21] spoke so the vision is a bride and
[2:14:25] bridegroom ain't that right so then
[2:14:28] brother Bram says every word is
[2:14:31] absolutely a part of almighty God Amen
[2:14:35] God made manifest wound into his word to
[2:14:39] show forth who he is and we're commanded
[2:14:42] as Believers to believe every word of it
[2:14:45] so no wonder those that would take take
[2:14:48] away or add to it is cursed of God can
[2:14:52] you say amen Amen brother Bram says to
[2:14:54] to take away or to add to would be to
[2:14:57] disfigure Christ his body can you say
[2:15:01] man he said it would be a freak body of
[2:15:03] God that's true it would have maybe like
[2:15:05] six fingers and one hand or three arms
[2:15:07] or something to add something or to take
[2:15:09] something away from that see it'd be you
[2:15:12] know and be you know one arm short or
[2:15:15] one finger short it's the complete
[2:15:17] everybody say it's the complete body of
[2:15:20] Jesus Christ and in Christ being the
[2:15:24] male the groom the bride is represented
[2:15:28] in him also and these two are
[2:15:33] one at that day you shall know that I am
[2:15:37] in my father the father in me I in you
[2:15:40] and you in me ain't that right so this
[2:15:43] Bible is a complete
[2:15:46] picture ain't that right yes that's why
[2:15:49] we must guard with everything that we
[2:15:50] have in US guard this Bible amen guard
[2:15:54] it in our
[2:15:56] hearts ain't that right because God's
[2:15:59] bringing this church to
[2:16:01] something it's it's in his
[2:16:04] vision come on now prise the Lord do you
[2:16:07] believe that
[2:16:10] amen and no wonder Satan is doing
[2:16:12] everything he can to add or take
[2:16:16] away he even do it within our own mind
[2:16:20] true thinking that God's done with you
[2:16:22] or thinking that God doesn't love you or
[2:16:24] thinking that you know you're you're
[2:16:25] you're just washed up or you're not
[2:16:28] going to make it or this or that so many
[2:16:30] thoughts don't you let him take away
[2:16:32] from the vision
[2:16:35] amen
[2:16:37] amen first of all the bridegroom came
[2:16:41] forth from the book that was
[2:16:44] God's part the first part of God's
[2:16:46] threefold me
[2:16:48] uh uh
[2:16:49] vision and the word became flesh for he
[2:16:53] was the vision of the Messiah secondly
[2:16:56] the bride in this day comes forth from
[2:16:59] the book the word made flesh also you
[2:17:02] believe it yeah why the prophet said she
[2:17:06] is flesh of his flesh bone of his bone
[2:17:09] life of his life power of his power
[2:17:12] notice how he's describing you as as
[2:17:15] being the bride you know why he's seeing
[2:17:17] it in a
[2:17:20] vision ain't that right he's seeing it
[2:17:22] in a
[2:17:23] vision and he's telling you what you are
[2:17:26] according to the
[2:17:28] vision amen hallelujah that's right life
[2:17:32] of his life power of his power she is
[2:17:35] him not different she is
[2:17:38] him that's
[2:17:40] it sometimes I think we hear that too
[2:17:42] much that it just becomes like brother
[2:17:45] Brown talks about the the the young man
[2:17:47] going one never been seen the sea before
[2:17:49] so he's going to look to the Sea you
[2:17:51] know he's so excited about the sea and
[2:17:54] sees that old Sean whatever and and and
[2:17:59] God say where are you going oh I'm going
[2:18:01] to go you know so he's just talking so
[2:18:03] much about the sea and and the air and
[2:18:05] all these things a you know and the
[2:18:07] guy's like I you know and and he the the
[2:18:11] guy's reaction the captain's reaction or
[2:18:13] Seaman is I've been here all this time I
[2:18:16] he wasn't see seeing what this young man
[2:18:19] was seeing but it become so common to
[2:18:22] him amen and I think sometimes these
[2:18:26] these little things that brother Bram
[2:18:27] tells us is so common true and then the
[2:18:32] devil is able to ride over that because
[2:18:36] we don't see the preciousness of
[2:18:40] it can you say
[2:18:42] Amen but we must guard this we must
[2:18:45] believe these things
[2:18:48] with all of our heart so much is this
[2:18:51] Bible so sacred that even brother Brown
[2:18:53] tells us don't put nothing on this Bible
[2:18:56] don't set your phone on the Bible don't
[2:18:57] set a cup on the Bible don't don't set
[2:18:59] this on the Bible don't set nothing on
[2:19:01] the
[2:19:03] Bible it's a sacred
[2:19:07] book when I see people putting it on the
[2:19:09] floor and they just tossing their Bibles
[2:19:11] I've seen people just toss their Bible
[2:19:13] I'm think what in the world they
[2:19:16] doing amen but sometimes we allow this
[2:19:19] thing to become very common to us in our
[2:19:22] hearts if we are to to hold this lital
[2:19:25] Bible sacred how much should we hold the
[2:19:28] word of God sacred in our heart don't
[2:19:30] you let the devil over
[2:19:33] it it's a
[2:19:35] vision it's you it's your guarantee that
[2:19:39] you're going to make it it's your
[2:19:42] guarantee God's already put you in the
[2:19:45] book so now here is a prophet reading
[2:19:49] your
[2:19:51] story positioning you in the
[2:19:55] vision sinner you wasn't you you wasn't
[2:19:58] in the vision as a sinner you wasn't in
[2:20:00] the vision as a
[2:20:02] vagabond you wasn't in the vision as
[2:20:05] some slave to the
[2:20:07] devil can you say Amen so God's been
[2:20:11] waiting and waiting and holding back the
[2:20:13] Rapture for you to come into the vision
[2:20:16] as he saw you now here's a prophet
[2:20:21] positionally placing
[2:20:23] Us in the
[2:20:25] vision you're not just a a a bride you
[2:20:29] are Miss Jesus Christ there's been
[2:20:32] Brides brides revivals revivals churches
[2:20:35] churches but now you are here that's not
[2:20:38] only got the uh the mechanics but the
[2:20:42] Dynamics you are what he saw in the
[2:20:45] vision amen
[2:20:49] now notice he says therefore we must be
[2:20:51] that word
[2:20:54] bride we must be the
[2:20:56] [Music]
[2:20:58] vision oh God don't don't settle down
[2:21:01] for just
[2:21:04] anything amen don't just settle down
[2:21:07] because you believe that God sent a
[2:21:09] prophet
[2:21:11] whoee
[2:21:14] Lord on so the uring sometimes when you
[2:21:19] talk to ministers and oh God sent a
[2:21:22] prophet and so you sit down and talk
[2:21:23] with them and you try to tell him about
[2:21:25] the problems well brother Brown messed
[2:21:27] messed up
[2:21:28] there and then they begin to tell you
[2:21:31] all the mistakes in this message and I
[2:21:33] want to think why I want to tell them
[2:21:35] why in the world are you hearing the
[2:21:36] message
[2:21:38] [Applause]
[2:21:39] anyways it's not good enough to be just
[2:21:43] say well God sent a prophet you've got
[2:21:45] to be a word bride
[2:21:47] [Applause]
[2:21:49] sitting there criticizing you know
[2:21:51] people have the audacity to CR criticize
[2:21:54] preachers but then it's worse I think to
[2:21:58] sit there in a Pew and or listening to a
[2:22:01] tape or whatever and critize the Very
[2:22:04] Prophet that God is used to reveal his
[2:22:10] secrets you say well he he just you know
[2:22:13] he contradicted himself so much do you
[2:22:16] realize the Revelation lays between the
[2:22:22] lines the prophet said you can't take
[2:22:24] this Bible and read it like you would a
[2:22:27] newspaper the Revelation is in the lines
[2:22:30] in between the lines can you say
[2:22:34] amen and same way with it you just can't
[2:22:37] re you can't just listen to this
[2:22:39] messages with carnal
[2:22:41] ears amen amen are you with me now
[2:22:45] watching your little movies and watch
[2:22:47] watchingg this and carrying on this and
[2:22:48] holding your tempers and and your and
[2:22:51] and your your grudges and all of these
[2:22:53] things and the gossip and then we're
[2:22:55] going to play a tape today it ain't
[2:22:57] going to work that way you've got to get
[2:22:59] in the spirit of
[2:23:01] it get in the spirit of it to where God
[2:23:05] begins to reveal what is actually being
[2:23:09] said giving you a picture of yourself in
[2:23:13] the
[2:23:14] book amen
[2:23:17] yes you believe
[2:23:19] it amen see therefore we must be that
[2:23:23] word
[2:23:24] bride we must be now notice what he says
[2:23:28] and what is that word bride good
[2:23:31] question right he says the manifestation
[2:23:34] of this
[2:23:35] hour the
[2:23:37] bride the manifestation of this hour
[2:23:41] right praise God you think Le leaning to
[2:23:43] your Pentecostal ways is going to help
[2:23:45] you you you got to die to that thing
[2:23:48] that's
[2:23:52] right amen hallelujah leaning the
[2:23:55] Presbyterian ways and Baptist ways and
[2:23:58] legalist ways and all kinds of ways
[2:24:01] coming into this message then we want to
[2:24:03] correct brother
[2:24:05] bradam and we want to do away with what
[2:24:07] he said if brother Bram says that
[2:24:09] dancing in the spirit is a sign of
[2:24:11] Victory let's say it that
[2:24:13] way I don't care what other people do
[2:24:16] there are kinds of fanatics but it
[2:24:18] doesn't take away from a
[2:24:22] bride
[2:24:23] hallelu if he speaks in certain ways and
[2:24:26] said this church is to be moving in the
[2:24:29] power of God then don't you settle down
[2:24:33] for some mediocre
[2:24:36] formality bless God bless God
[2:24:40] Amen can you say
[2:24:42] Amen see the word what is the word bride
[2:24:46] the Manifest of this hour the bride not
[2:24:48] a Creed nor a denomination but a living
[2:24:52] Oracle of God a living attribute of God
[2:24:56] displaying to the world the attributes
[2:24:58] of God in the formation of the
[2:25:02] Bride see that's to be
[2:25:05] expressed how do we know it's be to
[2:25:07] expressed it's in the book it's in the
[2:25:10] vision right amen and now we're here in
[2:25:14] this
[2:25:15] age Hallelujah Hall we're at the finale
[2:25:19] of it all Hallelujah can you say Amen
[2:25:22] brothers and sisters the head has come
[2:25:25] to the
[2:25:26] body the intelligence is now in the
[2:25:32] body bless God bless God it
[2:25:37] is you
[2:25:39] realize brother Brown talks about that
[2:25:41] we're this is the age of life he said
[2:25:45] this is the age of life the personal
[2:25:48] life of Jesus Christ prise God you see
[2:25:51] God's been building up building up
[2:25:53] building up all through the church ages
[2:25:55] go listen to the Masterpiece building up
[2:25:57] through the church ages and and there's
[2:25:59] been baptisms under the Son of God
[2:26:03] dispensation there's been baptism of the
[2:26:05] Holy Spirit brother BR said Luther had
[2:26:06] the baptism Wesley had the baptism of
[2:26:08] the holy spirit so there's been life all
[2:26:10] the way through amen sure but in this
[2:26:15] age did you notice it's not Son of God
[2:26:19] it's son of
[2:26:21] man and under this son of man age
[2:26:25] brother Bram now takes the Holy Ghost
[2:26:28] and says it's a
[2:26:31] token amen never has there ever been a
[2:26:35] requirement for a token except this age
[2:26:39] that's right that's what brother brand
[2:26:42] says but what does that mean it means
[2:26:45] that the personal
[2:26:47] life the fullness of Christ is now in
[2:26:51] the
[2:26:54] church not just a little bit to wiggle
[2:26:56] your toe not just a little bit to to to
[2:27:00] stutter around by your tongue but the
[2:27:03] whole life of God is now in the
[2:27:08] church as Christ what God was in Christ
[2:27:11] so Christ is in
[2:27:14] you you can't get any higher than the
[2:27:18] token for it's himself impersonated in
[2:27:24] the
[2:27:24] [Applause]
[2:27:26] church we've come to the fullness of the
[2:27:31] vision we're it they without us cannot
[2:27:35] be made
[2:27:36] perfect they've been waiting for
[2:27:40] us can you say Amen they've been looking
[2:27:44] for
[2:27:45] us I H ly believe that when he said the
[2:27:48] psalmist says let the redeemed of the
[2:27:49] Lord say so oh let the redeemed of the
[2:27:51] Lord say so oh let the yeah y'all read
[2:27:53] that chapter he'll talk about the
[2:27:55] goodness of God and he says let the
[2:27:56] redeemed of the Lord say so then he goes
[2:27:58] on talking about the the goodness of God
[2:28:00] oh that man would praise the Lord let
[2:28:02] the redeemed of the Lord say so and he's
[2:28:04] going on on on I just can't help believe
[2:28:07] that there was that pulsing of the
[2:28:09] spirit looking for a time that a people
[2:28:13] would rise up and fulfill that scripture
[2:28:17] the redeemed of the Lord why because of
[2:28:20] the music no but because the word had
[2:28:23] become open and they see themselves in
[2:28:26] the book John was our type and he began
[2:28:30] to worship he began to praise God he
[2:28:33] begin to have a Revival it was a bride's
[2:28:36] Revival that was so far from the regular
[2:28:39] revivals that they had had all the way
[2:28:41] down can you say Amen oh Jesus Christ in
[2:28:45] the church today
[2:28:49] we must become we must become that a
[2:28:53] living Oracle of God a living attribute
[2:28:55] of God displaying to the world the
[2:28:57] attributes of God in the formation of
[2:28:59] the Bride that's to be expressed in this
[2:29:02] hour that we're now living see if you're
[2:29:04] not part of a vision yep you you you can
[2:29:08] go to church you can be religious you
[2:29:10] can do all the dos and don'ts you could
[2:29:12] have it all pat down you can know this
[2:29:15] Bible backward and forward and I I'll
[2:29:17] even go as far as you can say the
[2:29:18] message backward and forward and all
[2:29:20] these things but what separates you from
[2:29:22] the the the others is there's a vision
[2:29:25] concerning you a vision concerning you
[2:29:28] and it's so far superior than your
[2:29:30] abilities it's so far superior than your
[2:29:33] own knowledge you didn't even have to
[2:29:35] know that you were bride God called you
[2:29:38] out because he knew you were bride
[2:29:40] praise the
[2:29:44] Lord I believe that God knew
[2:29:48] Rebecca when
[2:29:51] Abraham sent his servant elzer to go
[2:29:54] find a a bride for Isaac I believe that
[2:29:58] God already knew amen praise God eler
[2:30:02] probably didn't but he was sent on an
[2:30:04] errand to go get a bride but here was a
[2:30:07] prophet now giving us in between the
[2:30:13] lines that you don't have to worry or
[2:30:15] wonder how did Rebecca get there did he
[2:30:17] just pick the first girl he
[2:30:20] saw did she just happen to be there no
[2:30:23] brother Brown said an angel of the Lord
[2:30:25] went before elzer and beat him there 30
[2:30:31] minutes 30 minutes before elzar got
[2:30:35] there the angel of the Lord was already
[2:30:36] working on Rebecca saying go to the well
[2:30:39] go nudging her go to the well why he
[2:30:43] already had her in the vision
[2:30:47] amen can you say Amen no wonder the
[2:30:50] prophet couldn't get discouraged the
[2:30:51] spirit of the Lord was upon that man
[2:30:53] giving him the strength every night to
[2:30:55] get up and preach and there were people
[2:30:57] rejecting him and and hating him they
[2:30:59] tried every which way to prove him false
[2:31:01] and a fraud and Fa all these things and
[2:31:04] he the preachers forsook him and thought
[2:31:06] he was too dumb and and all these things
[2:31:09] you all know all these things that he
[2:31:10] talked about but the spirit of the Lord
[2:31:12] was directing him to that Pulpit every
[2:31:14] night but I believe the spirit of the
[2:31:15] Lord's been directing us too the spirit
[2:31:18] of the Lord you didn't just come to this
[2:31:20] message by
[2:31:21] coincidence the spirit of the Lord been
[2:31:23] directing you it's been pushing you it's
[2:31:25] been protecting you brother
[2:31:27] be because there's a vision praise the
[2:31:30] Lord Jesus there's a vision amen now so
[2:31:36] so first there was Messiah the
[2:31:39] bridegroom second there's the
[2:31:42] bride which that's what we are but then
[2:31:44] there's that third that we're entering
[2:31:46] into to and brother Brown said he's
[2:31:48] going back home to Eden with his Fallen
[2:31:50] wife redeemed back home again that's
[2:31:53] Christ in the church today what is his
[2:31:56] Fallen wife what is that redeemed bride
[2:31:58] Christ in his church today and now he's
[2:32:01] taking her back
[2:32:03] home amen oh my it's so wonderful isn't
[2:32:07] it so wonderful and and that's when the
[2:32:11] glory or the knowledge of the Lord uh uh

[2:32:32] and bow their heads I look come out
[2:32:34] walking Yonder from behind those doors
[2:32:37] here there he comes the King of Kings
[2:32:38] the Lord of lords and he walks down
[2:32:41] along the table and wiping each one's
[2:32:43] eyes and putting his arm around them and
[2:32:45] saying now don't cry it's all over now

[2:33:03] little fiction stories of Santa Claus
[2:33:05] that's thus sayith the
[2:33:08] Lord and that's the seed that's right
[2:33:12] now becoming materialized right now it's
[2:33:16] moving in now church this world is
[2:33:19] shaking it's quaking things are falling
[2:33:21] apart and Trump ain't going to fix
[2:33:24] that but who

[2:34:23] uh aliens or whatever they call UFOs

[2:34:36] this age that them UFOs have been
[2:34:38] here they're investigating angels for
[2:34:41] this
[2:34:43] age amen can you say Amen so don't you
[2:34:46] think that you're alone God's watching

[2:34:50] at he knows your number he's got
[2:34:53] you do you believe that he's got your
[2:34:56] number sister marth's got your number
[2:34:59] yes sir if you're part of the vision
[2:35:02] don't you worry he's coming for
[2:35:07] you part of the
[2:35:09] vision so there's no way you can be left
[2:35:12] behind amen ain't that right
[2:35:17] now you say well how do I know how how
[2:35:19] do I know that it's me well now notice
[2:35:22] brother brandham said this he says now
[2:35:24] you wouldn't have to necessarily have
[2:35:26] your name in the Bible that's right but
[2:35:29] as long as you're in Christ you're in
[2:35:32] the Bible amen you're in him in the
[2:35:37] Bible that's right as long as you're in
[2:35:39] Christ then you are in the fullness of
[2:35:42] the
[2:35:43] Bible not one promise is going to be be
[2:35:46] left you
[2:35:48] amen you're not going to be deprived of
[2:35:51] nothing you're in the fullness of the
[2:35:53] Bible you're in full position when
[2:35:57] you're in
[2:35:59] [Music]
[2:36:00] Christ amen well I got the baptism of
[2:36:02] the Holy Ghost but I don't know if I'm
[2:36:03] going in a Rapture
[2:36:05] hogwash oh
[2:36:07] my Lord you're in full
[2:36:11] position well I know he can heal me but
[2:36:13] I just don't know if he can deliver me
[2:36:15] what
[2:36:16] you're in full
[2:36:20] position so why not just believe all of
[2:36:23] it that's right and
[2:36:27] act this word my wife probably tells me
[2:36:30] live What You Preach that's right act
[2:36:33] upon it amen us act upon it speak it say
[2:36:39] it that's right believe it
[2:36:44] am
[2:36:47] see the vision or the word that came to
[2:36:50] the prophets was so beyond their
[2:36:51] capability of
[2:36:54] understanding or even providing such
[2:36:58] accuracy they would only speak as the
[2:37:01] vision came to
[2:37:02] them but they knew it wasn't them they
[2:37:05] knew it was of God so they put they
[2:37:07] themselves put their hopes into it they
[2:37:09] they put their faith in it they well uh
[2:37:13] uh uh Hebrews 11:13 tells
[2:37:16] these all died in faith not having
[2:37:19] received the promises but having seen
[2:37:22] them a far off not being in this day but
[2:37:25] they saw your day they spoke of your day
[2:37:29] not having been in messiah's day but
[2:37:32] they spoke of him because they saw him
[2:37:35] can you say Amen having seen them a far
[2:37:39] off and were persuaded of them and
[2:37:43] embraced them that's right think of that
[2:37:47] now by seeing them a far off and believe
[2:37:52] me it was a
[2:37:54] vague maybe they didn't understand
[2:37:56] everything that was happening yes but
[2:37:58] they knew something was
[2:38:00] happening and they knew it was of God
[2:38:03] they knew what they were seeing was sure
[2:38:06] it was a solid foundation that they
[2:38:09] would actually not live for this day
[2:38:12] it's just like Messiah as I've said so
[2:38:13] many times before they had I believe the
[2:38:16] prophet saw Messiah they saw the lamb so
[2:38:19] here they come and they offered the
[2:38:21] natural lamb and many people many of the
[2:38:25] Israelites probably just looked at that
[2:38:27] lamb and said well bless God this is
[2:38:30] where I'm at but those that were able to
[2:38:32] see past that lamb and see the true lamb
[2:38:35] they saw it a far off and they embraced
[2:38:39] that lamb knowing that this lamb spoke
[2:38:42] of that lamb can you say Amen now those
[2:38:45] that just looked at that land they got
[2:38:47] caught up in the traditions and the
[2:38:49] ideologies and all of that you
[2:38:51] understand what I'm saying but see that
[2:38:54] so they were persuaded of them embraced
[2:38:56] them and and they confessed what they
[2:39:00] saw made them confess that they were
[2:39:03] strangers and pilgrims on the
[2:39:06] earth see the vision was their absolute
[2:39:10] and the vision is given as a guide do
[2:39:13] you believe that Lord do you know that
[2:39:16] Jesus would do nothing but what the
[2:39:19] father first showed him by
[2:39:22] Vision yeah uh John 5:19 the son can do
[2:39:28] nothing of himself but what he seeth the
[2:39:29] father do for what things soever he
[2:39:31] doeth these also doeth the son likewise
[2:39:34] amen so see brother Braham said that's
[2:39:37] how the father dealt with Jesus was by
[2:39:39] Vision he was limited to what his father
[2:39:41] would tell him to do see so he wasn't
[2:39:45] led by emotions he wasn't led by
[2:39:46] Impressions he wasn't led by how he felt
[2:39:49] and and and all these things which which
[2:39:52] ought to tell us that if Jesus would
[2:39:55] only act upon vision and and that vision
[2:39:59] would be his absolute that that he saw
[2:40:02] the vision of that that man uh uh at the
[2:40:07] pool of Bethesda that he would step over
[2:40:09] everybody ignore everybody that was
[2:40:11] around that was dying that needed him
[2:40:14] even more but he didn't have that vision
[2:40:16] for them and he looked for that one man
[2:40:20] and told him to now he had the power to
[2:40:22] tell everyone to get up but but he never
[2:40:26] the vision was his
[2:40:29] absolute can you say Amen so then the
[2:40:32] vision should our be be our absolute for
[2:40:35] it's the only thing that is thus say the
[2:40:39] Lord now notice what brother Bram said
[2:40:42] about the bride of Christ they do only
[2:40:44] his will just as Jesus did he said amen
[2:40:46] I believe that no one can persuade them
[2:40:49] different no matter what little RI
[2:40:51] revivals come and what looks good and
[2:40:53] how many emotions and how many this and
[2:40:56] what everybody else is doing no one
[2:40:58] persuade them different they have thus
[2:41:01] set the Lord or they keep
[2:41:03] still it has to be the vision or they
[2:41:07] keep
[2:41:09] still true so the vision has to be first
[2:41:12] can you say Amen am oh do you love him
[2:41:15] amen that's good amen wonderful I I
[2:41:19] thought of you know as I get ready to
[2:41:22] close there's so many interpretations of
[2:41:25] the
[2:41:26] word and yet many read from the same
[2:41:29] Bible that we read from and they get
[2:41:32] this interpretation that interpretation
[2:41:35] and we and and to be honest we're
[2:41:37] finding it even in within the message
[2:41:41] ranks but the Bible doesn't have one
[2:41:44] contradiction in in
[2:41:46] it brother Bram said the the problem is
[2:41:49] is the
[2:41:52] people the people let men put their own
[2:41:55] interpretation of this word and causes
[2:41:57] them to be
[2:41:58] deceived he said see the churches cannot
[2:42:01] agree themselves on the interpretation
[2:42:03] of it the Methodist can't agree with the
[2:42:05] Baptist Baptist the Presbyterian
[2:42:07] Presbyterian Pentecostals whatever he
[2:42:09] said see with about 40 different
[2:42:11] organizations of Pentecost they can't
[2:42:12] agree with one another so you see that
[2:42:16] would be babbling again Babylon again
[2:42:19] confusing so so here God would call us
[2:42:23] out of Babylon by
[2:42:26] Vision
[2:42:28] hello something that would be sure not a
[2:42:32] man leading us to his personality not a
[2:42:34] man amen leading us to his own idea no
[2:42:38] no no that just brings confusion again
[2:42:41] yeah but this message is a vision so he
[2:42:45] br brings us out of confusion to a sure
[2:42:49] thing
[2:42:50] hello so so anything that is trying to
[2:42:55] bring us back into confusion
[2:42:58] again it has to be of the
[2:43:02] devil do you believe
[2:43:04] that how how can one book bring so many
[2:43:08] different
[2:43:09] interpretations well number one Luke
[2:43:12] 10:21 in that hour Jesus rejoiced in
[2:43:14] spirit said I thank thee oh Father Lord
[2:43:16] of Heaven and Earth that thou has hi
[2:43:18] these things from the wise and prudent
[2:43:20] and has revealed them unto babes ain't
[2:43:22] that right so so e even though the
[2:43:25] vision is written in the book it remains
[2:43:27] a mystery until God reveals it brother
[2:43:30] Bri says think of almighty God sitting
[2:43:32] in his own word with power to Blind the
[2:43:34] rich and impudent and educated Scholars
[2:43:37] blind their eyes so they can't see him
[2:43:39] and Open the Eyes of the poor and
[2:43:41] illiterate ain't that right but then we
[2:43:44] we find that even the elect wouldn't be
[2:43:47] able to see see it if Jesus didn't open
[2:43:51] our eyes if if our eyes hadn't been open
[2:43:54] we wouldn't be able to see and this is
[2:43:57] the proof of it that that here was the
[2:44:00] two men walking on the road to emus they
[2:44:03] had just lived out Bible prophecy all
[2:44:06] the all through these things and the
[2:44:07] only one that really knew it was Jesus
[2:44:10] he he knew he was the Messiah he's the
[2:44:12] one that said I'll raise up in 3 days I
[2:44:14] believe Maybe the disciples were there
[2:44:16] to hear him say that but when he was
[2:44:18] crucified and he was buried then they
[2:44:21] fell apart and and so here they are the
[2:44:24] two walking on the road to EMAs they're
[2:44:26] all downcast they're sad they're talking
[2:44:28] and then the Bible says Jesus appears
[2:44:30] right to them begins to talk to them
[2:44:32] Flesh and Blood talking to them and ask
[2:44:35] them why are y'all so cast down well are
[2:44:37] you a stranger here in these parts you
[2:44:39] know and so they began to tell him the
[2:44:41] events that has happened and then Jesus
[2:44:44] he don't even know they don't even know
[2:44:46] who he is and Jesus starting with the
[2:44:49] the old well first he says oh you fool
[2:44:51] slow of heart to believe all the things
[2:44:53] that the the Bible has said and he
[2:44:55] starts with Moses and he begins to go
[2:44:57] through the scriptures concerning
[2:45:00] himself right and they still don't see
[2:45:04] it but in the evening
[2:45:07] time in the evening time is when he went
[2:45:11] aside in a room with him and he began to
[2:45:14] break the bread he prayed he blessed
[2:45:17] that bread and he break the bread the
[2:45:19] Bible says and he gave it to them and
[2:45:22] brother brand said something he done
[2:45:24] there yeah something he' done all of a
[2:45:27] sudden the Bible says their eyes were
[2:45:31] open and they knew
[2:45:34] him but he was laying himself all in the
[2:45:37] scriptures to
[2:45:39] them and when the evening time came wow
[2:45:43] amen yes sir Church
[2:45:45] we're in this age
[2:45:47] again in the evening time yes sir oh do
[2:45:51] you love him if the musicians will
[2:45:55] come got so much more to go but we'll
[2:46:00] wait that's good prise the Lord the
[2:46:03] resurrected Christ has been made known
[2:46:05] to us
[2:46:06] today do you believe it
[2:46:10] amen and I'm I'm so glad that we can see
[2:46:16] that we're part of that yes sir as he
[2:46:19] said you know brother brandham in the
[2:46:22] Easter it is the rising of the Sun what
[2:46:26] a resurrection that was of 2,000 years
[2:46:28] ago but what a resurrection this
[2:46:30] is he has risen
[2:46:34] again in the form of a bride amen that
[2:46:39] was part of the
[2:46:41] vision it's amazing how they they say oh
[2:46:45] well you need to we we need to we need
[2:46:47] to check everything brother Braham
[2:46:50] [Music]
[2:46:52] says by this Bible and if it ain't in
[2:46:56] this Bible you don't believe
[2:46:58] it and all I can say is what
[2:47:02] morons lightly
[2:47:04] [Music]
[2:47:06] put how do you take a Bible and correct
[2:47:10] a
[2:47:12] prophet when we didn't even know the
[2:47:14] Bible
[2:47:16] it took a prophet to make the Bible
[2:47:18] known to
[2:47:19] [Music]
[2:47:21] us and if we can see that we're not out
[2:47:26] to set a the prophet correctly and
[2:47:28] correct him brother Ram even said nobody
[2:47:31] stood before a prophet nobody stood
[2:47:33] there before Isaiah Jeremiah and any of
[2:47:36] them and judged
[2:47:38] them now a when we're talking of
[2:47:41] speaking in
[2:47:43] tongues when we're talking
[2:47:45] interpretation of
[2:47:47] tongues Paul said it very
[2:47:50] clearly as well as the prophet said it
[2:47:54] over and over very clearly that a church
[2:47:57] is not to receive that unless it's
[2:48:00] judged first
[2:48:03] amen it's got to be judged before it's
[2:48:07] given to the church
[2:48:09] amen dreams and so forth I'd like to get
[2:48:13] into that more
[2:48:16] because God there is a vision for the
[2:48:19] church

[2:48:24] only to live in confusion in the
[2:48:27] message no no no no amen there's a real
[2:48:31] vision for the
