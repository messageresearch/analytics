[43:58] um the 23rd chapter
[44:01] and says the Lord is my shepherd
[44:05] I shall not want.
[44:08] I maketh me to lie down in Green
[44:10] Pastures he leadeth me beside the Steel
[44:12] Waters
[44:14] he restoreth my soul eliteth me in the
[44:17] paths of righteousness for his name's
[44:20] sake
[44:21] yea though I walk through the valley of
[44:23] the shadow of death I will fear no evil
[44:28] for thou art with me
[44:31] I want to stop right there
[44:34] and may we just bow our heads and talk
[44:37] to the Lord father
[44:40] we're so glad then
[44:44] you have the final say over our lives
[44:48] over this world
[44:50] our future
[44:53] whatever
[44:54] you have created you Reign you rule over
[44:58] it all
[45:00] father we find that even Satan is
[45:04] limited to what he can do
[45:07] and it's only because you allow him to
[45:09] do it
[45:11] and father we give you all praise we
[45:14] give you glory tonight
[45:16] for you're still on the throne
[45:19] and oh God we're just asking that you
[45:21] would be with us now
[45:23] that you would speak Lord through your
[45:26] word and that every heart would be
[45:29] edified may we be drawn closer to you
[45:33] father
[45:34] oh God we just declare our love to you
[45:38] we thank you for all that you've done
[45:40] for us
[45:41] we ask these things in Jesus Christ's
[45:44] name amen
[45:47] you can be seated tonight
[45:50] and trust you had a good day today this
[45:53] is a beautiful one that's for sure
[45:56] and um it's always a good day when
[45:59] you're serving the lord some days can be
[46:02] a little gloomy and all depending on the
[46:04] weather I guess but uh other than that
[46:08] it's always bright if if we've got the
[46:12] light within us
[46:13] amen but thinking of this he leadeth me
[46:20] in the paths of righteousness and
[46:24] of course we know uh there is a a
[46:28] certain requirement
[46:30] that Jesus had
[46:33] and still has for those who are going to
[46:37] follow
[46:38] of course he's he's not going to be the
[46:40] follower he's going to be the leader
[46:43] and he requires those to follow him and
[46:48] if we're going to follow him there's
[46:52] that requirement you know uh he said in
[46:56] one place let him deny himself and
[46:58] follow me
[47:00] let him take up his cross and follow me
[47:04] to the rich man he said sell all that
[47:07] thou Hast and give it to the poor and
[47:09] follow me
[47:11] that there's always the requirements and
[47:14] of course many people can't follow it's
[47:17] just
[47:18] um because it's it's self-sacrifice it's
[47:22] it's a requirement that um uh uh well
[47:27] the only ones that can follow is the
[47:31] Sheep for for that's what Jesus said you
[47:35] know he said my sheep hear my voice and
[47:37] they follow me ain't that right so he
[47:41] leads by his voice and his sheep uh they
[47:44] they follow and so David is saying here
[47:48] he leadeth me in the paths of
[47:51] righteousness and we we know that it's
[47:54] not a carnal leading it's it's a
[47:57] supernatural leading it's it's the
[47:59] supernatural that is leading us and God
[48:02] is Supernatural
[48:04] so for us to follow the lord we have to
[48:08] believe in the Supernatural how many
[48:11] believes in the Supernatural you believe
[48:12] in the Supernatural I do and and you
[48:15] have to believe in the Supernatural uh
[48:18] because uh uh he has a way of leading
[48:22] and and we we can't tell him how to lead
[48:26] God must be the one to do the leading
[48:29] ain't that rhyme now brother Branham
[48:31] said if we follow man then we're we're
[48:34] miserable but if we'll just follow the
[48:38] Holy Spirit he'll lead us to every
[48:41] promise of the Bible do you believe that
[48:43] he'll lead us to every promise of the
[48:46] Bible then he says may everything be
[48:48] fulfilled in the people's lives here
[48:51] today well I believe that this is the
[48:54] time this is the age this is the season
[48:57] for all the word of God to be fulfilled
[49:00] do you believe that not a part of the
[49:03] word but all of the word it it must be
[49:05] God's word must be fulfilled a man and
[49:09] for he said and we said it read it many
[49:12] times there in the in Isaiah where he
[49:15] said my word will not return unto me
[49:18] void but it shall accomplish that which
[49:20] I please it shall prosper in the thing
[49:23] whereto I sin it ain't that right now we
[49:26] know what the prophet said there in this
[49:29] day uh where it becometh us to fulfill
[49:32] all righteousness uh brother Branham
[49:35] said that that word righteousness is
[49:38] God's word so it must it becometh us to
[49:42] fulfill all God's word amen that's what
[49:46] the righteousness is is God's word and
[49:49] so therefore walking the paths of
[49:52] righteousness and fulfilling the
[49:56] all-righteousness is the same thing amen
[49:59] and that is fulfilling God's word for
[50:02] this day ain't that right he leads us in
[50:06] the paths of righteousness and and it's
[50:09] not book learning it's it's not a really
[50:12] a code of conduct uh uh or or or a form
[50:16] of legalism or a form of worship but
[50:20] it's it's actually just uh uh fulfilling
[50:23] the word of God ain't that right see
[50:26] that's a path that every believer of God
[50:28] a man has to walk and that is the path
[50:32] of righteousness uh fulfilling God's
[50:35] word and so we we we find that when
[50:39] Jesus came he came to fulfill the word
[50:42] of God uh which spoke of him to do a man
[50:45] that was his whole goal that was his
[50:47] whole purpose that was his motive that
[50:50] was his Drive was to fulfill the word of
[50:53] God for he said that that I do nothing
[50:55] but what the father first show me and he
[50:58] says my meat is to do the will of him
[51:01] that that sent me ain't that right well
[51:03] that's not only in Jesus but that's
[51:06] every believer that is here today their
[51:10] meat is to do the will of the father
[51:12] amen and and and and and we pray just as
[51:16] Jesus taught us to pray and and and that
[51:19] is not my will but thine be done it's
[51:22] it's thy kingdom come thy will be done
[51:26] in earth as it is in heaven ain't that
[51:28] right and so all of his life Jesus was
[51:33] led by the spirit of God we've read this
[51:36] before but brother Branham said no
[51:38] matter if he was in a storm and The
[51:41] gales knocking the boat from one side to
[51:43] the other or he was standing in the face
[51:46] of mess of demons he if he was if if he
[51:50] was hanging anywhere it never moved him
[51:52] see he walked right on along just as
[51:56] calm and quiet as he could be why he was
[52:00] simply unconscious of fear or anything
[52:04] around around him that's right whether
[52:06] it was going to happen or whether it
[52:08] wasn't going to happen he knowed it was
[52:11] going to happen because God said so do
[52:14] you believe that he he laid his his
[52:17] comfort was in the word of God and our
[52:20] comfort is in the word God said so
[52:23] that's it ain't that right amen he said
[52:26] he didn't say oh I wonder if I pray
[52:28] through wonder if I fasted long enough
[52:30] wonder if I did this he just walked
[52:33] right on unconscience that's right he
[52:37] believed what God Said was truth see the
[52:41] words must be fulfilled everybody say
[52:43] the word must be fulfilled amen wake up
[52:47] every morning and say the word must be
[52:49] fulfilled amen when you go to bed at
[52:52] night the word must be fulfilled the
[52:55] trial that you face the word must be
[52:57] fulfilled amen anything that you go
[53:00] through the word must be fulfilled and
[53:03] he knew his his life was to fulfill them
[53:07] Jesus walked on the earth with the
[53:09] purpose knowing that his life was to
[53:12] fulfill the word of God then brother
[53:15] Branham says and you're here to fulfill
[53:17] it too amen say I am here to fulfill it
[53:21] I am here to fulfill it too just walk
[53:25] unconscious of fear walk in conscience
[53:27] of criticism walk unconscious of the
[53:30] world walk as you walk in Christ walk
[53:33] with him not paying any attention to the
[53:36] right hand or to the left just keep
[53:39] moving on if something comes up in the
[53:41] church walk with God if sickness strikes
[53:44] you walk with God if the neighbor don't
[53:46] like you walk with God just keep walking
[53:49] with God he said Enoch one day walk like
[53:53] that amen so now your brother Braham
[53:56] showing us how Enoch walked amen he just
[53:59] walked along with God Amen not caring
[54:01] about nothing else not fearing nothing
[54:04] else not worrying about nothing else he
[54:06] just walked with God ain't that rap amen
[54:09] and you have to walk like that if you're
[54:12] going to walk in the paths of
[54:13] righteousness ain't that right amen yes
[54:16] sir amen he says see you know what he
[54:18] done he walked all the way home with God
[54:21] got so far up the road he didn't want to
[54:24] come back anymore amen and I believe
[54:27] that's where a lot of us are tonight
[54:28] amen we just don't want to go back to
[54:30] where we came from ain't that right no
[54:33] trial big enough no sickness be strong
[54:36] enough no devil amen uh uh uh uh bad
[54:40] enough a man to make us want to go back
[54:42] so the word of God must be fulfilled in
[54:47] your life and there's nothing more amen
[54:50] for you to do than to fulfill the word
[54:53] of God nothing more better for you to do
[54:56] than to fulfill the word of God and I'm
[54:58] so glad that we could all be part of it
[55:00] amen whether you're rich whether you're
[55:02] poor whether you're smart whether you're
[55:04] dumb whether you're a beautiful whether
[55:07] you're ugly whether you're fat you're
[55:09] skinny tall short whatever amen your
[55:12] purpose is is to fulfill the word of God
[55:16] Amen seek now if we're the bride if we
[55:19] are the Bride of Jesus Christ Christ
[55:22] then we have to fulfill all the word
[55:25] that speaks of the Bride for this age
[55:28] amen not one word can be left out do you
[55:31] believe that amen seed this bride she is
[55:34] to unite with him as husband and wife
[55:37] for that's the word for this age ain't
[55:40] that right she is to take on his name
[55:43] for that is the word for this age amen
[55:47] this is the age that she the bride of
[55:49] Christ becomes Miss Jesus Christ that
[55:53] that that isn't just a fantasy that is a
[55:56] reality there is a mortal people on this
[56:00] Earth that have taken on the name of
[56:04] Jesus Christ how did she get there he
[56:07] led her there amen that's exactly right
[56:10] amen see you can't walk the paths of
[56:13] righteousness and not take on his name
[56:16] so whatever she does she does in the
[56:19] name of Jesus Christ amen whatever she
[56:22] says as she does it in the name of Jesus
[56:25] Christ she prays in his name she sings
[56:28] in his name she preaches in his name she
[56:31] worships in his name she gathers in his
[56:35] name ain't that right I thought of
[56:38] listening to a message the other day and
[56:40] brother Branham talks of the time that
[56:42] there is a meeting I think in 60. I I
[56:45] think it was on the news the Jesus
[56:47] movement or something like that but they
[56:49] gathered Protestants and Catholics all
[56:51] gathered 150 000 brother Branham thought
[56:54] a man was there to say prayers and so
[56:57] forth but notice what he says he said
[56:59] they might as well not even gathered
[57:01] because it had no value to God you
[57:04] understand what I'm saying amen you see
[57:06] there's a bride though that when she
[57:08] gathers it has everything to do with God
[57:11] it has value to do with God and Jesus
[57:14] said it didn't matter if there was only
[57:15] two or three that were gathered in his
[57:18] name he would show up the God of heaven
[57:20] will never be too busy Amen to come in
[57:23] the presence of two or three a man that
[57:26] have gathered in his name it isn't a
[57:28] bunch that that makes the difference it
[57:30] is in the thousands of gathering a man
[57:33] that moves God is a people that is
[57:35] called and bearing the name of Jesus
[57:39] Christ Well church we are to fulfill
[57:42] amen that tonight amen yes sir she is
[57:46] the only one that has his name she is
[57:49] identified with him in the fact that she
[57:52] is one with him do you believe that I'm
[57:55] talking about the paths of righteousness
[57:57] for our day amen we've come God's been
[58:00] leading the church all the way up into
[58:02] this age and here we are everything that
[58:06] he has thought about the mystery and the
[58:08] heart desire that he has longed for is
[58:11] now being fulfilled in a people in this
[58:14] age and you ain't going to miss it
[58:18] can you say amen for he's leading you in
[58:21] the paths of righteousness that's right
[58:24] see she is one with him she is loyal to
[58:27] him and him alone she is faithful to him
[58:31] and to him alone she serves him and to
[58:34] him alone okay ain't that right she
[58:37] cares for him and him alone and what is
[58:40] he he is the word
[58:42] ain't that right he is the word and you
[58:45] know what she is the protector of him
[58:47] you believe that she is the protector of
[58:50] him you say well God's my protective but
[58:52] what about you protecting him
[58:54] he's the word ain't that right you
[58:57] remember what what Abraham God told
[58:59] Abraham he had to sway that sacrifice
[59:02] amen and and and so it it seemed to be
[59:06] just he had to wait all day and there's
[59:07] that sacrifice and there was the
[59:09] buzzards a man that was trying to land
[59:11] on that sacrifice and the Bible says
[59:13] that Abraham shoot all the birds off and
[59:16] brother Brown said that is the type of
[59:17] the believer today that is shoeing off
[59:20] every unbelieving devil off of this word
[59:22] of God Amen there is a people on the
[59:25] Earth it's already written that you're
[59:28] going to defend the word it's already
[59:30] written that you will be a protector of
[59:32] him can you say Amen yes sir amen we're
[59:35] not going to let unbelief come into the
[59:37] church we're not going to let unbelief
[59:39] come in our home we're not going to let
[59:41] unbelief come into our heart we're not
[59:43] going to let unbelief can you say amen
[59:45] amen come in and have its way amen we
[59:49] are the protector of him that's right
[59:52] see and also if we are the church Church
[59:55] of the Living God then we have to
[59:57] fulfill all the word that speaks of the
[1:00:00] church and we know what church means it
[1:00:02] means called out ones ain't that right
[1:00:04] amen says so in this age God has a
[1:00:08] people he's called his people to come
[1:00:10] out of her ain't that right see that
[1:00:13] that's walking the paths of
[1:00:14] righteousness amen you're coming out of
[1:00:17] her why why did you leave your
[1:00:19] denominations why have you forsaken amen
[1:00:21] the traditions and the doctrines and the
[1:00:24] ideas of of men that have been Pastor
[1:00:26] the generation say Amen because you have
[1:00:30] come to walk in the paths of
[1:00:32] righteousness to fulfill the word of God
[1:00:35] Amen a man cannot walk in the paths of
[1:00:38] righteousness as long as he refuses to
[1:00:41] come out of her many people come into
[1:00:43] this message still holding the Baptist
[1:00:45] ways Pentecostal ways Methodist ways can
[1:00:49] you say amen amen it's sad to believe
[1:00:52] that here is a a supernatural message
[1:00:54] that God has Vindicated over and over
[1:00:57] and over supernaturally and you got
[1:00:59] people that don't even believe in the
[1:01:01] Supernatural and they say it among the
[1:01:04] Church of the Living God they don't
[1:01:06] believe in miracles they don't believe
[1:01:07] in healing they don't believe in a new
[1:01:09] birth they don't believe in a messy
[1:01:11] birth hey man they don't believe in the
[1:01:13] gifts anymore they don't believe in
[1:01:14] nothing amen they just want the church
[1:01:16] to become dead and formal but if you're
[1:01:19] walking in the paths of righteousness
[1:01:21] you've got to believe the word of God
[1:01:24] and if he is the same yesterday today
[1:01:26] and forever then you can't put limits on
[1:01:29] God Amen you can't believe God in a
[1:01:32] certain way and deny him the rest of the
[1:01:34] way know this bride this church is going
[1:01:37] to believe in it all can you say amen
[1:01:40] that's right see amen see it's in this
[1:01:43] time see you're not walking in the paths
[1:01:46] of righteousness if the token isn't on
[1:01:48] display for we're living in the time of
[1:01:51] the Third Exodus amen not just playing
[1:01:54] church amen it's that's over with amen
[1:01:57] coming to church and doing our little
[1:01:59] thing amen that's over with amen just
[1:02:02] come in and being insincere that's over
[1:02:04] with amen the church has moved up God is
[1:02:07] now requiring a token in the evening
[1:02:10] time ain't that right yes sir and that
[1:02:13] token has to be over the door ain't that
[1:02:15] right and we've heard what the prophet
[1:02:18] said the door is your heart
[1:02:20] where's the token going to be not on
[1:02:22] your emotions but in your heart
[1:02:25] amen not on Sensations but in your heart
[1:02:27] ain't that right and we know that it's
[1:02:29] not the chemistry of the blood that is
[1:02:31] required it's the life that is in the
[1:02:34] blood that is required ain't that right
[1:02:38] well Church you know we know what kind
[1:02:40] of a blood that you were saved by you
[1:02:42] wasn't saved by the blood of a goat the
[1:02:44] blood of a of a sheep you were saved by
[1:02:47] the blood of God Amen therefore God
[1:02:49] requires his own life to be at the door
[1:02:52] of your heart on display amen and what
[1:02:55] is at your heart it's your soul ain't
[1:02:58] that right and in that Soul the prophet
[1:03:00] said he's a predestinated seed of God
[1:03:02] that God laid in there before the
[1:03:05] foundation of the world do you believe
[1:03:07] that yes sir see so that's the real you
[1:03:12] ain't that right that's the real you
[1:03:15] what God thought you to be what God
[1:03:17] ordained you to be amen is at the door
[1:03:20] of your heart
[1:03:22] ain't that right and it all becomes
[1:03:25] quickened amen when that token comes in
[1:03:29] that token life comes into your heart
[1:03:31] and is on display amen everything that
[1:03:35] God called you to be and ordained you to
[1:03:37] be amen that now becomes Quicken you're
[1:03:41] no more a sinner you are a son of God
[1:03:43] you can never be a sinner again amen for
[1:03:47] the eternal life of God is at the door
[1:03:49] of your heart and every word that God
[1:03:52] has promised you is now quickened inside
[1:03:55] of you
[1:03:59] brother Adam said he's not a filthy
[1:04:01] Spirit he's a Holy Spirit
[1:04:03] and then when you become subject to that
[1:04:05] Spirit it throws your whole being
[1:04:06] subject to that spirit
[1:04:08] and that spirit is nothing in the world
[1:04:10] but this seed word may manifest or
[1:04:13] quickened Hallelujah Made Alive
[1:04:17] so when the Bible said don't do this
[1:04:18] that body quickly turns to it why
[1:04:21] there's no question
[1:04:23] amen or do you love him
[1:04:25] yes sir so I thank God for token life

[1:04:56] believe aren't you glad for that the
[1:04:59] sign shall follow them believe that

[1:05:02] some of the signs that'll follow the
[1:05:04] believer Amen in my name they shall cast
[1:05:08] out devils
[1:05:11] not give ear to them Devils but cast

[1:05:31] surface the lid has been lifted off and
[1:05:34] every demon of hell is manifesting
[1:05:36] itself in the people of the Earth today
[1:05:39] can you say Amen but now there is a
[1:05:41] people that's on this Earth amen that

[1:06:00] walking in the paths of righteousness
[1:06:02] you have the authority to cast it out
[1:06:04] you have the authority to cast that
[1:06:06] devil of depression out you have that
[1:06:09] Authority in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:06:12] they shall take up serpents and if they
[1:06:14] drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt
[1:06:17] them and they shall lay hands on the
[1:06:20] sick and they shall not might they shall
[1:06:23] recover ain't that right so so these are
[1:06:27] walking in the paths of righteousness if
[1:06:29] you're a Son of God then you've got to
[1:06:32] walk the paths of righteousness amen

[1:06:37] of God must be fulfilled in this age do

[1:07:11] we're going to get there he's hard to
[1:07:13] provide of the way
[1:07:15] it's not a straight it's like being

[1:07:39] worrying and wondering and hoping and
[1:07:41] groping oh no we're living in a life

[1:07:47] he's the one that's leading us
[1:07:50] you see the manifestations of sun is
[1:07:52] happening now brother Brown said the
[1:07:55] same power that rested in Jesus Christ
[1:07:57] rest in the placed sons in the body of
[1:08:01] Christ
[1:08:02] ain't that right same power
[1:08:04] I'll say it the same deity
[1:08:07] same God

[1:08:12] same Dynamics it rested upon him now at
[1:08:16] rest upon you as sons of God ain't that
[1:08:19] right see it's a placing of a son take
[1:08:22] him out in a certain place and have a
[1:08:24] ceremony before Angels Place him
[1:08:27] positionally what he is in the body of
[1:08:29] Christ then that person has the
[1:08:32] authority
[1:08:33] ain't that right he said let me say this
[1:08:36] if you count me a fanatic from this
[1:08:38] night on that very same thing that I'm
[1:08:40] speaking of will everybody say will be
[1:08:43] done

[1:08:46] church and is now coming in that the
[1:08:48] Holy Spirit Will sowing on to people
[1:08:50] till they'll speak the word and it'll
[1:08:53] create itself right there we haven't
[1:08:55] seen Powers like coming into the church
[1:08:57] now now that was that was 60 60 years
[1:09:00] ago or so amen when he spoke that uh uh
[1:09:03] these words or maybe even more amen but
[1:09:07] here we are standing I believe with all
[1:09:10] my heart that them powers are now
[1:09:12] resting upon the church amen the world
[1:09:15] is in her position politics is in her
[1:09:17] position Russia is in her position
[1:09:20] Israel is in her position and I believe
[1:09:22] with all my heart this church is in her
[1:09:25] position
[1:09:26] amen amen amen she is stemmed the test
[1:09:30] she has stood the trial she has stood
[1:09:32] believing with all of her heart
[1:09:34] protecting that word and now it's time
[1:09:38] for her to fulfill what God has spoken
[1:09:41] of her
[1:09:42] I just believe it
[1:09:44] can you say Amen
[1:09:46] yes sir he said I know it for a fact we
[1:09:49] haven't seen power like's coming into
[1:09:52] the church now he said there will be a
[1:09:54] power put in the church and now is
[1:09:56] coming in and that the Holy Spirit Will
[1:09:58] so anoint the people till they'll speak
[1:10:00] the word and it'll create itself right
[1:10:02] there we haven't seen Powers likes
[1:10:05] coming into the church he said I know it
[1:10:07] for a fact say unto this mountain be
[1:10:10] moved don't doubt in your heart but
[1:10:12] believe that what you've said shall come
[1:10:14] to pass and you can have what you said
[1:10:16] ain't that amazing how that scripture is
[1:10:19] now applicable Amen to you and I it's at
[1:10:23] your disposal at the time that hell has
[1:10:25] been Unleashed
[1:10:29] we in a people God didn't call us in
[1:10:31] this age just sit there and say woe is
[1:10:33] me oh poor poor pity me I just don't
[1:10:37] know what I'm gonna do I I just I don't
[1:10:40] even know if I'm going to make it if
[1:10:41] you're the sons of God he is going to
[1:10:43] lead you he is leading you into these
[1:10:46] scriptures
[1:10:47] the church is moving into these
[1:10:49] scriptures can you say man why it must
[1:10:52] be fulfilled of you don't you look at
[1:10:54] how powerful the devil is don't you look
[1:10:57] at the Giants standing before you look
[1:10:59] at the promise David looked at the
[1:11:01] promise Samson looked at the promise
[1:11:03] Gideon looked at the promise if he can
[1:11:06] do it as mortal men as a natural seed
[1:11:09] what can you do as a supernatural seed
[1:11:12] it's time for the church to rise up and
[1:11:15] I say she's here
[1:11:17] she's here why he's leading Us in these
[1:11:21] Paths of righteousness
[1:11:23] amen he said see the placing the placing
[1:11:28] of the church in position where the
[1:11:30] fullness of the power of the Holy Ghost
[1:11:32] comes into the church then critic Smiles
[1:11:35] will be shut it'll be a short time Jesus
[1:11:38] come right off the mountain stray went
[1:11:40] straight to Calvary notice it won't long
[1:11:43] last long but it'll be here ain't that
[1:11:46] right why he's leading a people there's
[1:11:49] a people following him amen they denied
[1:11:52] themselves they denied their reasonings
[1:11:55] they've denied their senses they've
[1:11:57] denied it all they they they're looking
[1:11:59] to him and him alone and they're
[1:12:01] protector of the promise can you say
[1:12:03] Amen
[1:12:05] amen yes sir yet in in all of this
[1:12:09] walking in the the paths of
[1:12:11] righteousness David lets us know that
[1:12:14] we're walking in the Valley of the
[1:12:15] shadow of death
[1:12:17] see God doesn't lead us then in the
[1:12:20] paths of righteousness when we get into
[1:12:22] the Millennium a man see but he leads us
[1:12:25] now amen while we're walking in the
[1:12:29] Valley of the shadow of death it's not a
[1:12:32] dark Valley brother Brown said most
[1:12:33] people a man have have mistaken that and
[1:12:36] they've misquoted it by saying he
[1:12:38] leadeth me or though I walk in the dark
[1:12:41] Valley of the shadow of death but he
[1:12:44] said see if there's a shadow then it's
[1:12:46] not a dark Valley amen because there's a
[1:12:50] shadow ain't that right it's not a dark
[1:12:52] Valley so there has to be a certain
[1:12:54] amount of light to make a Shadow if it's
[1:12:57] all light there cannot be a shadow if
[1:12:59] it's all dark there cannot be a shadow
[1:13:01] ain't that right amen so we we we live
[1:13:05] in a world of Darkness but we can save
[1:13:09] praise God it's not all dark ain't that
[1:13:13] right it's not all dark now gross
[1:13:15] Darkness upon the people but there's a
[1:13:18] scripture that same scripture that will
[1:13:20] tell us it's not all dark amen that's
[1:13:24] right it's see we live in a world that's
[1:13:26] full of trouble and trials but it's not
[1:13:29] all troubles and trials amen we live in
[1:13:33] a world of unbelief but it's not all
[1:13:35] unbelief
[1:13:37] belief amen it's not all negative it's
[1:13:40] positive can you say man why the light
[1:13:43] is shining ain't that right the light is
[1:13:46] shining look at us amen we are both
[1:13:49] natural and Supernatural amen so we are
[1:13:52] dealing with both sides of the Corn so
[1:13:55] to speak Amen in our natural birth we
[1:13:58] were born defeated but yet there's
[1:14:00] another birth a man that does not leave
[1:14:03] us in darkness ain't that right it's in
[1:14:07] our Supernatural birth that we were born
[1:14:09] to overcome
[1:14:11] in our natural birth we didn't stand a
[1:14:13] chance but in our spiritual birth we got
[1:14:16] every reason Amen to make it and you're
[1:14:19] going to make it there is no if ands or
[1:14:22] buts you're going to make it can you say
[1:14:25] Amen you're in a shadow
[1:14:29] that's right as Believers we've had our
[1:14:31] share of Trials but also we've had our
[1:14:34] share of Triumph ain't that Ron we've
[1:14:38] had our share of tears and sorrow and
[1:14:40] Agony but we have shed our tears of joy
[1:14:44] we've had times in our life where we've
[1:14:46] tasted a man defeat and yet at the same
[1:14:50] time we've in in our lives in this whole
[1:14:53] body and this whole world we've tasted
[1:14:56] Sweet Victory amen we've known what it
[1:14:59] is like not to feel the presence of the
[1:15:02] Lord we've gone maybe months years of
[1:15:05] not feeling his presence and it would
[1:15:07] seem like it would be that way forever
[1:15:09] amen but then we've known a man that
[1:15:12] that that were times where the presence
[1:15:14] of God is so strong Upon Our Lives amen
[1:15:18] that when we pray he's right there
[1:15:19] before we pray amen we're just thinking
[1:15:22] about it our prayer is answered can you
[1:15:24] say Amen we've had our share of
[1:15:27] rejoicing in his presence and feel him
[1:15:29] near we've had our times of
[1:15:31] discouragement and yet we've had our
[1:15:33] times of encouragement
[1:15:35] ain't that right amen I look at Paul's
[1:15:38] life and and he he kind of expresses
[1:15:41] this Valley of shadowness amen for he
[1:15:44] says there in second Corinthians 4 6 for
[1:15:47] God who commanded the light to shine out
[1:15:49] of Darkness has shined in our hearts to
[1:15:52] give the light of the knowledge of the
[1:15:54] glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ
[1:15:58] to give the light ain't that right amen
[1:16:02] but we have this treasure in Earthen
[1:16:05] vessels not Angelic bodies but in the
[1:16:08] vessel that you have now a vessel that
[1:16:11] was born in sin a vessel that that is
[1:16:14] subject to corruption uh that is subject
[1:16:17] to vanity that is subject to sickness
[1:16:19] that's subject to these things and yet
[1:16:22] we have a treasure that is eternal in
[1:16:26] the same vessel
[1:16:29] can you say man
[1:16:31] oh my
[1:16:32] so we have this treasure in Earthen
[1:16:35] vessels that the Excellency of the power
[1:16:37] may be of God and not of us listen to
[1:16:41] what he said we are troubled on every
[1:16:43] side but not distressed
[1:16:46] we are perplexed but not in despair
[1:16:50] aren't you glad that we're walking in
[1:16:52] the Valley of the shadow where there's a
[1:16:54] shadow there yes sir persecuted but not
[1:16:57] forsaken cast down but not destroyed
[1:17:01] amen always bearing about in the body of
[1:17:04] the dying of the Lord Jesus that the
[1:17:07] life also of Jesus might be made
[1:17:10] manifest in our body so we're bearing in
[1:17:14] our lives in our body a a death amen of
[1:17:18] suffering amen but at the same time
[1:17:20] there's a life that has been made
[1:17:22] manifest through the same body
[1:17:25] it's a paradox I know that he's leading
[1:17:28] us
[1:17:31] for we for we which live are always
[1:17:34] delivered unto death for Jesus sake that
[1:17:36] the life everybody saved the life also
[1:17:39] if Jesus may be made manifest in our
[1:17:41] mortal flesh
[1:17:43] my my my how can a man speak of death
[1:17:46] and life at the same time amen but see
[1:17:49] we're a reflection of something aren't
[1:17:51] we
[1:17:51] that's right see so no matter how dark
[1:17:54] it gets for the believer there will
[1:17:57] always be light
[1:18:00] aren't you glad for the Hat
[1:18:02] you know Paul explains what makes a
[1:18:06] Believer rise a man when it seemed like
[1:18:09] he's down for the count
[1:18:10] Romans 8 and 16 the the spirit everybody
[1:18:14] say the spirit say the spirit that is
[1:18:16] one that's leading this a man beareth
[1:18:19] witness with our spirit that we are
[1:18:21] children of God
[1:18:23] now listen you're in a world a valley of
[1:18:26] shadow of death you're hearing that that
[1:18:29] negative and yet you're hearing the
[1:18:30] positive you're hearing that you ain't
[1:18:33] going to make it but yet there's the
[1:18:34] spirit of God that tells you you're
[1:18:36] going to make it amen you're hearing of
[1:18:39] you know how many people that I've
[1:18:41] talked to that sits in church that is
[1:18:43] afraid that they've already crossed the
[1:18:45] line and there's no way of Mercy getting
[1:18:46] back and yet there's the spirit of God
[1:18:49] that tells us a man that you are sons of
[1:18:53] God you're the children of God ain't
[1:18:56] that right but notice and if children
[1:18:58] then heirs
[1:19:00] Heirs of God and Joint heirs with Christ
[1:19:03] if so be that we suffer with him that we
[1:19:06] may be also glorified together
[1:19:08] for I reckon that the sufferings of this
[1:19:11] present time are not worthy to be
[1:19:12] compared with the glory which shall be
[1:19:15] revealed in us for the earnest
[1:19:18] expectation of the creature Wade is for
[1:19:21] the manifestation of the sons of God
[1:19:24] notice for the creature was made subject
[1:19:27] to vanity not willingly but by reason of
[1:19:32] him who the same has subjected the same
[1:19:36] in Hope because the creature itself also
[1:19:40] shall be delivered
[1:19:47] can you say that with me I shall be
[1:19:48] delivered
[1:19:50] that's a promise
[1:19:52] you didn't say the creature might be
[1:19:55] he said they shall be
[1:19:58] shall be delivered from the bondage of
[1:20:00] corruption into the Glorious Liberty of
[1:20:02] the children of God
[1:20:04] for we know that the whole creation
[1:20:05] groanth and travaileth and pain together
[1:20:07] until now and not only they but
[1:20:10] ourselves also which have the first
[1:20:13] fruits of the spirit even we ourselves
[1:20:15] grown within ourselves waiting for the
[1:20:19] adoption to wit the Redemption of our
[1:20:21] body
[1:20:22] now notice what Paul is saying here and
[1:20:24] I hope this is all right I hope I'm
[1:20:26] making a little sense to you anyway we
[1:20:28] were made subject to vanity what was it
[1:20:32] trials
[1:20:33] tribulations
[1:20:35] testings Temptations
[1:20:38] sickness and pain and heartaches
[1:20:41] diseases
[1:20:43] discouragements challenges I mean every
[1:20:46] faces them
[1:20:48] letting him beat now now listen it'd be
[1:20:50] something if we could just avoid all of
[1:20:52] this and say he leadeth me in the paths
[1:20:55] of event of of of of of of righteousness
[1:20:57] and all we can talk about is Victory and
[1:21:00] all we can talk about is glorious times
[1:21:02] and all we can talk about is just
[1:21:04] abiding in his presence and all we can
[1:21:06] talk about amen is and know nothing else
[1:21:09] amen but that's not the case amen he
[1:21:13] subjected these people us and that is
[1:21:16] leading to the the the the paths of
[1:21:19] righteousness he subjected us into this
[1:21:22] Valley amen of shadow of death amen he
[1:21:26] subjected us to vanity can you say Amen
[1:21:29] now of suffering and loneliness and and
[1:21:32] feeling Forsaken and feeling amen
[1:21:35] rejected and feeling unworthy and
[1:21:37] feeling amen like I I just can't go on
[1:21:40] anymore and and he allows us in in a
[1:21:44] place to where we can hear the voices of
[1:21:46] the devil amen that would tell us how
[1:21:49] unworthy we are and how hopeless we are
[1:21:51] and how wretched we are can you say man
[1:21:54] he has subjected us into these things we
[1:21:58] didn't subject ourselves to this God by
[1:22:01] reason of his own reason his own purpose
[1:22:04] have subjected us amen for his purpose
[1:22:08] he had a reason for allowing this to
[1:22:10] happen amen the Bible says the steps of
[1:22:13] a righteous man are ordered of the Lord
[1:22:16] do you believe that amen all the and I'm
[1:22:20] so glad that the Lord is the all-wise
[1:22:22] god he's the only wise God he does
[1:22:25] things in wisdom he knows how to ordain
[1:22:28] he knows the path that you're going to
[1:22:30] take amen but just be remembered it's
[1:22:33] not a dark Valley it's a valley that has
[1:22:36] a shadow
[1:22:43] brother Brown says Jonah we know him we
[1:22:45] know he was a prophet many of them
[1:22:48] referred to him as some kind of a
[1:22:49] Runabout he wasn't the footsteps of
[1:22:52] righteousness ordered of the Lord
[1:22:54] he said I was reading the book not long
[1:22:56] ago he did go to Tarsus or start a to it
[1:22:58] instead of Nineveh but that was all
[1:23:01] everybody say that was all
[1:23:03] in God's plans
[1:23:04] that was all in God's plans see the
[1:23:08] footsteps of the righteous because
[1:23:10] sometimes the evil befalls you or
[1:23:12] something see it was so with job amen
[1:23:16] see job was the best man in the land in
[1:23:18] his days best man God could find and yet
[1:23:21] look what happened to him see God wasn't
[1:23:23] chastening him amen God was trying him
[1:23:27] God was proven to Satan he had somebody
[1:23:29] that would believe him in the face of
[1:23:32] difficulty
[1:23:34] God loves to prove to the devil that
[1:23:37] there's going to be somebody to believe
[1:23:38] him
[1:23:39] amen no matter how dark it gets and no
[1:23:41] matter how rugged it gets or no matter
[1:23:43] how alone they have to stand amen it
[1:23:46] does not matter it'll prove to the devil
[1:23:48] amen that there will be somebody amen
[1:23:52] there's somebody on this Earth that will
[1:23:54] not forsake the path of righteousness
[1:23:57] can you say Amen
[1:23:59] that's right hang on do it he led the
[1:24:02] children to the Red Sea they were
[1:24:04] trapped and it looked like God had led
[1:24:06] them into a trap ain't that right amen
[1:24:09] he led them through the Wilderness amen
[1:24:12] and he led them straight to Bitter
[1:24:15] Waters
[1:24:17] that's right brother Brown said let him
[1:24:19] write into temptation right into where
[1:24:21] the waters was bitter and they couldn't
[1:24:24] drink they had nothing to eat listen now
[1:24:26] these are God's people that was on the
[1:24:28] path to duty these God's people that was
[1:24:31] walking fulfilling the word of God for
[1:24:34] their day and God would not lead them to
[1:24:36] an oasis he led them to Bitter Waters
[1:24:39] where they had nothing to eat they had
[1:24:41] nothing to drink it was a Temptation
[1:24:44] ain't that right he said see look that
[1:24:47] stream of Myra bitter Waters laid right
[1:24:49] in God's path he was leading his
[1:24:52] children isn't it strange look like God
[1:24:54] would have bypassed that but he led them
[1:24:56] right straight up to that water see some
[1:24:59] to the waters some through the floods
[1:25:01] some through deep trials but all through
[1:25:04] the blood that's God's way of leading
[1:25:07] his people you ain't going to be able to
[1:25:09] create your own Oasis if God has led you
[1:25:12] out in the desert hey man but I promise
[1:25:15] you he'll not leave you you'll not
[1:25:17] forsake you he's already ordained your
[1:25:21] end can you shame man amen the best
[1:25:24] thing that we can do is relax the best
[1:25:26] thing we can do is put our lives in
[1:25:28] God's hands and let him have control it
[1:25:31] doesn't matter don't question God don't
[1:25:34] question his leadership amen you just
[1:25:37] follow the shepherd
[1:25:41] and you say man
[1:25:44] see you're here to fulfill the word
[1:25:47] but you are doing it in the valley
[1:25:49] where there's a shadow in it
[1:25:52] amen now brother Brown said yesterday
[1:25:55] people don't know
[1:25:56] you know we look at brother branham's
[1:25:59] life and water Revelation that we've
[1:26:00] caught
[1:26:01] that he was Malachi for
[1:26:04] that his ministry was Luke 17 30.
[1:26:07] Revelation 10 amen first Thessalonians
[1:26:11] 4.
[1:26:12] and it was Matthew 25 the voice of the
[1:26:16] bridegroom
[1:26:17] amen it was come out of her The Voice
[1:26:19] the Fulfillment of come out of her my
[1:26:21] people amen all these scriptures and and
[1:26:23] we can we we have the Revelation that
[1:26:26] has struck our hearts that this applies
[1:26:28] to brother Branham and his message he
[1:26:30] was the seventh age messenger ain't that
[1:26:32] right amen and it would look if we all
[1:26:35] stood back and we could look and say oh
[1:26:37] man that must have been an easy life for
[1:26:38] him God ordained it to be so godful and
[1:26:41] here he was fulfilling it must have been
[1:26:43] easy for him to fulfill it amen but
[1:26:45] notice what brother Brown said people
[1:26:46] don't know what depressing times comes
[1:26:48] with this type of ministry he said
[1:26:50] yesterday I got real depressed and I
[1:26:52] said to my wife I wish I could just go
[1:26:54] on and she said why do you say that bill
[1:26:56] now and I want you to know that he knew
[1:26:58] that he was to fulfill Elijah he knew he
[1:27:01] was Malachi 4 he knew as the Revelation
[1:27:04] began to grow it with him he began to
[1:27:07] understand and see his place in
[1:27:09] scriptures do you believe that and yet
[1:27:12] this is a man that got discouraged this
[1:27:14] is the man that wanted to go home
[1:27:16] brother Brown says and why do you say
[1:27:17] that he says oh here I have Troublesome
[1:27:20] things and then it seemed like the holy
[1:27:22] spirit said are you trying to bypass
[1:27:24] them
[1:27:27] what a rebuke
[1:27:28] the Holy Spirit didn't just sit there
[1:27:30] and baby and says oh bless your heart I
[1:27:32] wished I made you a little different I
[1:27:34] wish I would have made you like a real
[1:27:35] angel you know that had no troubles and
[1:27:38] trials and all that so you could fulfill
[1:27:39] my word accurately or correctly or
[1:27:42] without any troubles and problemses and
[1:27:44] hindrances and all of that amen but that
[1:27:47] wasn't a that wasn't what God said to
[1:27:48] him he said are you trying to bypass
[1:27:50] these things
[1:27:53] are you trying to dodge them no I said
[1:27:58] just let me stand right up in the face
[1:28:00] of it all and face it out it's so much
[1:28:03] better and he says honestly truly I say
[1:28:06] this by eyewitness that just after this
[1:28:09] life is over we enter a land that's
[1:28:12] beyond anything that anyone could ever
[1:28:14] think amen see so your Valley is not all
[1:28:18] dark there's a light in the valley amen
[1:28:21] that gives us a hope to keep looking on
[1:28:24] to keep pressing on Amen we're leading
[1:28:26] being led Amen in the paths of
[1:28:29] righteousness in this Valley a man of
[1:28:32] shadow of death
[1:28:33] yeah
[1:28:37] see the valley that you're walking
[1:28:39] through is not a dark Valley
[1:28:42] there's light
[1:28:44] and that is our hope
[1:28:46] is this okay
[1:28:48] there's a light light is our hope now
[1:28:52] notice psalms 27 1 the Lord is my light
[1:28:54] and my salvation
[1:28:56] then there's the question Whom Shall I
[1:28:57] Fear
[1:28:59] the valley isn't so dark after all huh
[1:29:02] the Lord my shepherd
[1:29:04] amen he's the one that's leading me in
[1:29:06] these Paths of righteousness as I'm
[1:29:09] walking through this Valley of the dark
[1:29:10] shadow of the shadow of death amen and
[1:29:13] and Dave is now writing of him and
[1:29:15] saying that he's my light and my
[1:29:17] salvation Whom Shall I Fear the Lord is
[1:29:20] the strength of my life I thought of
[1:29:23] that you know here you know uh and I'm
[1:29:25] going to use my dad for for a moment but
[1:29:27] that person amen has got him so weak
[1:29:29] many times and you know tonight he was
[1:29:32] telling me so my legs would just feel
[1:29:33] like here you know uh uh just trembling
[1:29:36] you know it's I've I've been doing good
[1:29:37] all day today and and and he says it
[1:29:40] just hit me and I I'm just so weak you
[1:29:42] know and and yet here he is tonight man
[1:29:44] I have to say that that scripture has
[1:29:46] been fulfilled amen the Lord is his
[1:29:49] strength amen the Lord is his strength
[1:29:52] when you feel like you can't go on I
[1:29:54] don't care if it's spiritually
[1:29:55] physically mentally the Lord is your
[1:29:57] strength how many can say the Lord is my
[1:30:00] strength amen when you thought you
[1:30:02] couldn't make it but the Lord is my
[1:30:03] strength I could testify that to you
[1:30:05] tonight hey man what I want to give up
[1:30:07] when I wanted to walk away when I say
[1:30:09] there ain't no way God get me out of
[1:30:12] this thing and I have to say the Lord is
[1:30:14] my strength
[1:30:17] [Music]
[1:30:18] of whom shall I be afraid of what shall
[1:30:22] I be afraid what devil shall I be afraid
[1:30:24] for the Lord is my strength he is my
[1:30:27] light can you say Amen you say but I'm
[1:30:29] going through a dark Valley but I say to
[1:30:30] you it's not all dark amen there's a
[1:30:33] shadow it's just a shadow look to a
[1:30:35] light there's a light somewhere amen
[1:30:37] that's guiding you
[1:30:41] Psalms 11905.
[1:30:44] Thy word everybody say Thy Word
[1:30:47] now he's saying the Lord is my light now
[1:30:49] he's saying Thy word is a lamp to my
[1:30:53] feet and a light unto my path
[1:30:56] so is it two no it's one and the same
[1:30:59] it's the Living Word
[1:31:01] that is a light to my path ain't that
[1:31:03] right Amen in Jesus said my word is
[1:31:06] spirit and life so it's not just this on
[1:31:09] written form amen pages but now it's
[1:31:12] spirit and it's life brother Brown said
[1:31:15] the word itself is spirit it's spirit in
[1:31:18] word form ain't that right and then you
[1:31:21] see when it is quickened or brought to
[1:31:24] life now when is that word quicken in
[1:31:26] you
[1:31:27] ain't that right the seed is laying in
[1:31:29] you ain't that right what is written in
[1:31:31] here now becomes in you quickened amen
[1:31:34] and brought to life see it's the spirit
[1:31:37] of the word that goes to work and acts
[1:31:42] is that all right as a preacher I can't
[1:31:45] lead you in the paths of righteousness
[1:31:47] amen all we can do is preach the
[1:31:49] promises all we do is preach amen what
[1:31:52] the what is in this word that it takes
[1:31:54] the spirit of the word to come inside of
[1:31:56] you and to Quicken that word and then
[1:31:59] watch that word go to work
[1:32:03] you're lacked ain't that right
[1:32:06] then it becomes your light
[1:32:08] it becomes your salvation
[1:32:10] ain't that right then the Lord your
[1:32:13] shepherd's leading you in the paths of
[1:32:16] righteousness you can't be led by
[1:32:18] through Seminary you can't be led by
[1:32:21] sitting on a Pew in the front Pew for a
[1:32:22] hundred years it takes the Lord to lead
[1:32:25] you and his leading will Quicken you
[1:32:31] John 14 16 Jesus says and I will pray
[1:32:33] the father and he shall give you another
[1:32:35] comforter
[1:32:37] that he may abide with you forever
[1:32:40] even the spirit of Truth whom the world
[1:32:42] cannot receive the world will not
[1:32:44] receive it because it seeth him not
[1:32:48] neither knoweth him
[1:32:50] so they have no relationship there's no
[1:32:52] leadership
[1:32:53] they're following their own devices
[1:32:55] cunning fables and and cunning devices
[1:32:58] amen they're being led by the very own
[1:33:00] lust within them and all these things
[1:33:03] but now he's talking to you but you know
[1:33:05] him for he dwelleth with you and shall
[1:33:08] be in you I will not leave you
[1:33:11] comfortless I will come to you who who's
[1:33:15] going to come to you the spirit of the
[1:33:17] word
[1:33:18] can you say Amen the spirit of the word
[1:33:21] amen just to think that you were in a
[1:33:23] dark uh dark denominationalism and dark
[1:33:27] all of these things but then the light
[1:33:29] came to you and quickened the word to
[1:33:32] you
[1:33:34] ain't that right he says now Jesus goes
[1:33:37] on says at that day at that day the day
[1:33:40] of his coming Revelation 6 10 1 and
[1:33:45] first Thessalonians 4 16 describes it as
[1:33:48] the dissension of Our Lord

[1:33:53] to you and you will know that I'm in the
[1:33:56] father and me and him and I in you you
[1:33:58] and me and I and you ain't that right oh

[1:34:54] word has come to lead you into the word
[1:34:58] lead you into the promises that have
[1:35:01] been laying dormant for years and years
[1:35:03] and years do you realize Paul said they
[1:35:05] without us cannot be made perfect
[1:35:07] brother Branham applies that to this day
[1:35:09] they without us I know Paul was talking
[1:35:12] about the amen the the the the Old
[1:35:15] Testament Saints but look at all the
[1:35:16] saints that have gone before you you are
[1:35:18] the finale of it all you are the
[1:35:21] completion of the picture you are the
[1:35:23] completion of God's drama you are the
[1:35:25] completion of what God had in his mind
[1:35:27] you are it
[1:35:29] and all the saints went that have gone
[1:35:31] before us they without us cannot be made
[1:35:34] perfect
[1:35:37] do you believe that
[1:35:39] so God didn't make you an angel God
[1:35:42] didn't make you in in some Invincible
[1:35:44] Superman amen as as or Spider-Man or
[1:35:47] this or that or that as the movies want
[1:35:50] a bad display amen he took a common born
[1:35:53] human being brother shamaya and he sent
[1:35:56] the spirit of his word to you to Quicken
[1:35:59] that see Gene word that is in you and
[1:36:02] you now become a living manifestation of
[1:36:06] the word of God he's leading you in the
[1:36:08] paths of righteousness
[1:36:10] something that Seminary could have never
[1:36:12] done
[1:36:13] something that theologians have tried to
[1:36:15] do for years and have never been able to
[1:36:17] do it something that uh denominations
[1:36:19] have tried to do and they've only
[1:36:21] quenched the spirit and they've died out
[1:36:24] but now in this age every promise in
[1:36:28] this book is now being made manifest in
[1:36:31] a people
[1:36:37] the time
[1:36:40] for you to fulfill the word has come
[1:36:45] the word had already been laying here
[1:36:47] written for this age
[1:36:49] but had been waiting for you
[1:36:52] the actor
[1:36:56] you say well God God's the actor and
[1:36:58] that's rightly so
[1:37:00] God had a certain mask
[1:37:03] [Music]
[1:37:04] God wanted to look a certain ways sister
[1:37:06] Rhonda
[1:37:08] so he waited for you
[1:37:11] is in this age
[1:37:13] Billy wanted to wait for a certain time
[1:37:16] so I could pick you
[1:37:18] before the foundation of the world he
[1:37:20] would say in this day I'm going to use
[1:37:22] this mask I'm going to use this form
[1:37:25] and I'm going to live in him
[1:37:27] and brother Brown said in one place that
[1:37:29] God chose to defeat his enemy through
[1:37:32] you sister Brenda amen God chose to
[1:37:35] defeat his enemy through a people he
[1:37:37] said I'm going to live in them people
[1:37:38] I'm going to have preeminence in them
[1:37:40] people and I'll defeat my enemy you
[1:37:42] understand why he's not going to take
[1:37:44] you from the enemy he's not going to
[1:37:46] take you from your challenges he's not
[1:37:48] going to take you away from problems
[1:37:49] he's going to defeat them problems
[1:37:51] through you he's going to defeat the
[1:37:54] enemy through you he's going to defeat
[1:37:56] and remember this is the worst age ever
[1:37:58] this is the most evil age ever but
[1:38:01] there's still a path that he is leading
[1:38:03] a people too and it's a path of Victory
[1:38:06] it's a path that is ordained for a
[1:38:08] people from this age for this time for
[1:38:11] this moment and you're that people that
[1:38:14] he's leading
[1:38:18] time
[1:38:19] amen amen praise Lord yes the word
[1:38:23] concerning you
[1:38:24] has come thy word thy light has come
[1:38:29] and as David said Thy word O Lord is
[1:38:32] what has caused me to Hope
[1:38:38] go to The Valleys with Thy word O Lord
[1:38:41] has caused me to Hope
[1:38:46] we have to cry and shed our tears
[1:38:50] of sovereign loneliness
[1:38:55] but when it's done
[1:38:56] it's not all dark
[1:38:59] for Thy Word
[1:39:01] has caused me to Hope
[1:39:05] and you say man
[1:39:08] he may have subjected me to defeat
[1:39:11] but defeat's not my end
[1:39:15] he may have subjected me to a life of
[1:39:17] testing and trials
[1:39:20] but according to his word there's an end
[1:39:21] to that all right
[1:39:23] he may have subjected me to a life of
[1:39:26] sickness and suffering
[1:39:29] but that's not my end
[1:39:31] and Thy Word
[1:39:33] has caused me to Hope
[1:39:36] can you say man
[1:39:38] see Psalms 30 and 5 weeping may endure
[1:39:41] for a night
[1:39:43] but joy
[1:39:45] cometh in the morning
[1:39:47] it just shows you you're walking through
[1:39:49] the valley of shadow of death
[1:39:52] amen
[1:39:54] Psalms 119 50. this is my comfort in my
[1:39:57] Affliction this is my comfort in my
[1:40:00] Affliction for Thy Word

[1:40:06] first or Psalms 119 47 and I will
[1:40:11] Delight myself in thy Commandments which
[1:40:14] I have loved
[1:40:15] my hands also will I lift up unto thy
[1:40:18] Commandments which I have loved and I
[1:40:21] will meditate in thy statues
[1:40:24] can you say Amen
[1:40:25] Amen brother Branham said this this body
[1:40:28] is subject to death and was brought
[1:40:30] forth by a woman not by nothing but
[1:40:33] through not by God you're a reproduction
[1:40:35] from Adam and Eve be black white or
[1:40:38] whatever you are you are a production
[1:40:40] and Offspring from Adam and Eve that
[1:40:42] makes your body born in sin shaping in
[1:40:45] iniquity come to the world speaking lies
[1:40:47] you're damned and condemned at the
[1:40:49] beginning of your life not even
[1:40:52] even with a Chance uh you see without a
[1:40:56] chance see he says now because the
[1:40:59] spirit that you have come to you by
[1:41:01] nature and by Nature coming from sexual
[1:41:04] intercourse desired by man and woman
[1:41:06] produces an Earthly child let that child
[1:41:09] alone and don't teach him nothing right
[1:41:11] he'll go wrong don't teach him neither
[1:41:13] right nor wrong he'll take wrong because
[1:41:16] it's his nature to do such watch a
[1:41:19] little baby not over higher than that he
[1:41:22] gets so mad and he'll just you know he
[1:41:24] ring his hands and and turn red in the
[1:41:27] face and hold his breath what is it it's
[1:41:29] his nature he got it from his Pappy or
[1:41:31] his Mammy see one she had enough temper
[1:41:34] to fight a buzzsaw or his daddy they
[1:41:36] didn't see his grandfather grandmother
[1:41:38] did see if they didn't see it's
[1:41:41] Offspring so see that makes your born in
[1:41:44] the world you come by nature and your
[1:41:46] whole being is black and smutty and
[1:41:48] Damned and cursed and going to hell see
[1:41:51] that's right see but when you're born
[1:41:53] again then the light of God shines down
[1:41:56] into that soul and then it's no more a
[1:41:59] dark Valley it's a valley with a shadow
[1:42:02] in it you may be veiled here with the
[1:42:05] Flesh and things known by faith but
[1:42:07] there's enough light in there and
[1:42:09] someday that light and darkness has to
[1:42:12] separate and when the light shines
[1:42:15] Darkness flees and when we go to be with
[1:42:17] Christ in that body darkness and death
[1:42:20] vanishes and we burst out into Perfect
[1:42:23] Light glory to God there we are no more
[1:42:27] sickness no more dark mixed with it no
[1:42:30] more pain no more Agony no more
[1:42:32] heartbreak no more loneliness no more
[1:42:35] confusion no more trials no more
[1:42:37] Darkness with it it's now in the perfect
[1:42:41] light you will not be walking in a
[1:42:43] valley with a shadow in it that you'll
[1:42:46] be walking with a perfect light and the
[1:42:49] Darkness will be gone it'll be destroyed
[1:42:52] it'll be utterly gone aren't you looking
[1:42:54] forward to that time to think that the
[1:42:56] Glorious time of gathering in this
[1:42:58] building amen that we can lift up holy
[1:43:01] hands and worship our lamb and our
[1:43:04] creator and our King and yet we do it
[1:43:06] with mind battles we do it with the
[1:43:08] pressure we do it of of with life
[1:43:11] hanging all over his head and the things
[1:43:13] that we're going through but there will
[1:43:15] be a day that you'll do the very same
[1:43:17] thing and there will be no trouble there
[1:43:19] will be no trial there'll be no
[1:43:20] headaches there will be no heartaches
[1:43:23] there will be no pain to hold you back
[1:43:25] yeah you'll be rejoicing around the
[1:43:28] throne Darkness will be gone
[1:43:32] how do I know it's there because he's
[1:43:34] leading us in the paths of righteousness
[1:43:38] and it's already been written that there
[1:43:41] is a day that is coming will be known
[1:43:43] that

[1:48:12] and we have ins and outs and ups and
[1:48:15] downs and joy and sorrow and so forth
[1:48:18] well
[1:48:19] it's just a shadow
[1:48:21] we got enough light to know that there's
[1:48:23] light there
[1:48:26] and we're still in the body and flesh
[1:48:27] but someday the day is going to break
[1:48:31] that's when the death angel sits at the
[1:48:33] foot of the bed and that's when the
[1:48:35] doctor says it's all finished
[1:48:37] and this natural comes away from the
[1:48:39] supernatural
[1:48:41] and the light Springs back to light
[1:48:45] and darkness goes back to Darkness
[1:48:48] then this Mortal puts on immortality
[1:48:50] that's when this corruption puts on
[1:48:52] incorruption
[1:48:54] that's when this Mortal puts on
[1:48:55] immortality and we become a creature

[1:49:44] it it it has no bounds to us it has no
[1:49:47] hope to us
[1:49:49] it hosts no grasp to us for he Our
[1:49:52] Shepherd is leading us

[1:50:08] the old black hair
[1:50:11] that has turned gray it's gonna go back
[1:50:13] black again
[1:50:16] [Music]
[1:50:18] the back that has been over it's going
[1:50:20] to straighten up again all the wrinkles
[1:50:22] will be gone

[1:50:42] has prepared for you

[1:50:58] much more does he want her to love you
[1:51:01] how much more does he want to grab you

[1:51:24] said it's not by might nor by power but
[1:51:25] by my spirit saith the Lord
[1:51:28] and I think we're all a testament to
