[42:51] you would help me to yield myself to you

[42:56] every Minister that's preaching this
[42:59] message Lord this evening father to
[43:03] whatever people that they're preaching
[43:06] to anoint them in a special way father
[43:11] we just give this service into your
[43:12] hands now in Jesus Christ's name and the
[43:16] church says amen amen and amen we've
[43:20] been reading this uh scripture for a
[43:22] little while but um I want to look at it
[43:28] again so Joshua uh
[43:32] 14 and we'll start at the 7th verse
[43:36] Caleb speaking here 40 years old was I
[43:39] when Moses the servant of the Lord sent
[43:42] me from cadesh Baria to spy out the
[43:46] land and I brought him word again as it
[43:49] was in Mine Heart nevertheless my
[43:52] brethren that went up with me made the
[43:55] heart of the people melt
[43:58] but I wholly follow the Lord my
[44:01] God and Moses swear on that day saying
[44:04] surely the land where on thy feet have
[44:08] trotten shall be thine
[44:10] inheritance and thy children's forever
[44:13] because the Lord H or because thou Hast
[44:18] holy follow the Lord my
[44:20] God and now behold the Lord hath kept me
[44:24] alive as he said these 40 and five years
[44:28] even since the Lord spake this word unto
[44:31] Moses while the children of Israel
[44:34] wandered in the wilderness and now lo I
[44:37] am this day 40 or four score and 5 years
[44:42] old as yet I am as strong this day as I
[44:46] was in the day that Moses sent me and my
[44:49] as my strength was then even so is my
[44:52] strength now for war both to go out and
[44:56] to come in
[44:57] now therefore give me this
[44:59] mountain whereof the Lord spake in that
[45:03] day for thou heardest in that day how
[45:07] the Anakin were there and that the
[45:11] cities were great and fenced if so be
[45:14] the Lord will be with me then I shall be
[45:17] able to drive them out as the Lord
[45:20] said then uh Romans the 10th chapter
[45:27] Romans
[45:30] 10
[45:32] amen and
[45:34] um we'll start at the eth
[45:38] verse but what saith it the word is n
[45:42] the even in thine mouth and in thine
[45:45] heart that is the word of
[45:47] faith which we preach amen amen do you
[45:52] love him amen amen you can have your
[45:54] seats this evening
[45:58] and we know that Caleb was a type of the
[46:02] believer um today who is following the
[46:06] end time
[46:08] message of God the prophet to us that so
[46:14] uh Caleb types no other
[46:17] person uh except those that are
[46:20] following this in time message Lord and
[46:23] um so you don't have to be a Baptist you
[46:25] don't have to be Pentecostal you don't
[46:27] have to be anything just follow the
[46:29] message of the hour and you have your
[46:32] type and that is Caleb and Caleb uh and
[46:36] Joshua res resisted the LIE of the 10
[46:41] spies uh that they had told the people
[46:45] where you know that we cannot take the
[46:47] land we are as as grasshoppers in the
[46:50] sight of those Giants and and um and and
[46:55] and such and so basically what what
[46:59] these 10 spies done is they refuted the
[47:01] message of the hour and uh they they um
[47:07] and they caused the people's hearts to
[47:10] melt and and so because the uh the
[47:14] people were not really persuaded in the
[47:17] message uh of of the hour uh then they
[47:22] they
[47:23] listened and um to to what the the spies
[47:28] had said and they believed it they they
[47:32] actually believed it and the spies them
[47:35] 10 men were able to turn the hearts of
[47:38] the people and and uh against the the
[47:43] message of the hour and and uh because
[47:47] they listen to the negative report and
[47:50] and and so the Bible calls it an evil
[47:53] report these 10 men gave an evil report
[47:57] anything against the message anything
[47:59] against the promises of God is an evil
[48:02] report and uh I I don't care what it is
[48:05] it's it's an evil report and and you
[48:08] don't we don't want to be one of those
[48:10] that give an evil report is say well you
[48:13] know I I'm not going to make it and I'm
[48:15] not this and I'm not going to do this or
[48:17] I can't and I'm not whatever I'm not
[48:20] worthy you're given an evil report uh
[48:24] because if there's nothing negative in
[48:26] the message there's nothing negative in
[48:28] the Bible in in the gospel in
[48:31] Christianity it's it's all positive
[48:34] ain't that right and so uh uh then you
[48:38] know the so they they gave this evil
[48:41] report and and the people believed it
[48:44] which only confirmed what was in them
[48:47] already and that was what Paul would
[48:49] call an evil heart of unbelief they had
[48:53] this uh evil heart and so as we know
[48:57] that God always allows us to hear two
[48:59] reports uh always and uh you you you
[49:03] will hear you know that that what God
[49:07] has to say and then you'll hear what
[49:09] maybe the doctor has to say or what the
[49:11] banker has to say or what Mom and Dad or
[49:15] uh uh and then a lot of times even what
[49:17] preacher has to say or denominations or
[49:20] whatever but but you'll always hear uh
[49:23] uh both sides you'll hear the positive
[49:25] report you'll hear hear the negative
[49:27] report and and we know that Satan has
[49:30] His prophets um which only speak uh
[49:34] negative uh that that's that's what they
[49:36] are and uh uh they speak contrary to the
[49:40] word of God and they are influenced by
[49:43] demons uh demonic spirits uh that come
[49:47] from The Unseen World now many many
[49:50] people may not believe uh in in that
[49:54] there is an Unseen World and that there
[49:56] is a a spiritual uh spirits that are
[50:00] float you know or I say floating around
[50:02] they're they're they're everywhere they
[50:05] present is just in an unseen Rim that we
[50:08] would call
[50:09] dimensions and and so uh there's it's an
[50:13] Unseen World of demons and and and also
[50:16] the angels of God and all people as
[50:20] we're taught by the message are
[50:22] influenced by either one brother
[50:24] brandham used a uh uh he he drew a line
[50:28] and you know uh
[50:31] um and he drew this line on on the
[50:34] billboard I'm Reckoning and and he says
[50:38] in that line is is Humanity that's the
[50:41] Mortal being uh and they're all living
[50:44] in that line and and above the line is
[50:48] is is angels of God in an unseen rim and
[50:53] below that line is is a demonic
[50:57] Powers uh uh uh in in that unseen rim
[51:01] and so he said and all people within
[51:04] that line are
[51:06] influenced uh either from above from The
[51:09] Unseen World above or the Unseen World
[51:12] beneath uh there and and and so now
[51:15] Demons of course they are fallen angels
[51:18] and they are at the command of God uh
[51:22] they are the ones who cause people to
[51:24] become sick uh they are the the ones
[51:27] that they cause blindness and and
[51:30] diseases and and uh uh deafness lame um
[51:37] uh things like that they they cause
[51:39] people to become depressed and and uh
[51:42] nervous um many many times if you just
[51:46] study that uh in the prayer line brother
[51:48] brandom constantly talking about people
[51:52] with nervous problems and he said it's a
[51:54] demon that that's that's what it is it's
[51:56] Satan that has caused uh the these
[51:59] things uh uh uh cancer it it's it's from
[52:03] demons and and and things like that but
[52:06] these demons also cause people to
[52:08] disbelieve the word of God and and
[52:11] brother brandom said Satan and his
[52:13] demons anoints Humanity to disbelieve
[52:17] the word of God so so always watch the
[52:20] anointing and what kind what you what is
[52:23] anointing you uh uh to speak ain't that
[52:27] right we could say that these 10 spies
[52:29] were anointed they were anointed of
[52:31] Satan his demons and and and because the
[52:35] people listened to what they had to say
[52:38] they became Anointed with that same
[52:41] spirit and and uh uh Anointed with
[52:45] unbelief and so then the angels of God
[52:48] that are above that line are are at
[52:51] God's command and uh the Bible says that
[52:55] these angels are encamped about those
[52:58] who fear the lord and and that is so
[53:01] true uh angels are with you and they
[53:05] they encourage us along the way they
[53:08] Inspire us they they they build our
[53:12] faith they they get us to believe and
[53:15] and uh they drive back demon power from
[53:18] us and they keep us from harm and and
[53:22] from Evil and but but it's an Unseen
[53:25] World that is really real and and so uh
[53:30] uh we we know these things and but
[53:33] brother brandom said you know in that
[53:34] line uh is is darkness and gy and and
[53:39] sin and muck and and it's just black U
[53:43] because it it's coming from an the the
[53:46] the Unseen World from beneath but he
[53:49] said every once in a while you'll see a
[53:52] white dot in that line just a a white
[53:55] dot and he says what that that is that's
[53:57] that's born again Christians within that
[54:01] line and and they are not of the
[54:04] darkness even though they're in the
[54:06] darkness but they they're shining a
[54:09] light can you say amen and so that
[54:11] that's Christians them little lights uh
[54:14] is a Christian and their influence comes
[54:17] from uh above a ain't that right and so
[54:21] that's what you are in this world is is
[54:24] little lights uh if if you could see in
[54:27] in the spiritual realm it is this world
[54:30] is dark uh brother brandom even talked
[54:32] about it and he he draw that line of uh
[54:35] and he left just a little sliver uh in
[54:39] in there uh and and he did that when he
[54:41] saw it it was Plum Darkness but he left
[54:44] a little sliver to represent you and I
[54:48] as as lights in this world Amen but
[54:51] Satan's job is to get you to disbelieve
[54:55] God's word and and then if he succeeds
[54:59] in doing that then the word will become
[55:02] of no effect to you now think of that
[55:05] you can still set in a church you can
[55:07] still claim Christianity you can still
[55:10] but the word has no effect in your life
[55:13] see and so that's exactly what it was uh
[55:16] when Israel at Kadesh Baria they they
[55:20] chose to believe the evil report of
[55:23] these men that was anointed with a a DE
[55:26] demon of unbelief and and and and the
[55:29] word then become no effect to them amen
[55:34] and and even though they were still
[55:35] Israelites and but they wandered around
[55:38] in the wilderness um uh and and no doubt
[55:42] they probably heard about promises and
[55:45] because Caleb I guarantee you Caleb
[55:47] wasn't quite about it amen and and
[55:49] Joshua but at at the same time they they
[55:53] God had already told them you will not
[55:55] go in you you will not partake of the
[55:58] word of God in its fullness see and so
[56:01] brother Brandon would tell us we have to
[56:03] stop and and separate it uh uh we have
[56:06] to separate uh between what is Satan and
[56:11] what is God what the anointing that
[56:13] Satan is putting upon the people and the
[56:15] anointing that God is is putting upon
[56:18] the people what Satan is saying and what
[56:20] God is Satan or or saying and and and
[56:24] we've got to stop and separate amen
[56:27] don't don't just believe everything that
[56:29] you hear don't accept everything that
[56:32] comes along your your way uh first John
[56:36] 4:1 beloved believe not every Spirit but
[56:40] try the spirits whether they are of God
[56:43] because many false prophets are gone out
[56:46] into the world ain't that right so so
[56:50] Kaleb representing us that are wholly
[56:54] following the message of the hour he
[56:56] refused to listen to the rhetoric of the
[56:59] unbeliever he just refused to give into
[57:02] it it it just it just wasn't there for
[57:06] he believed God's word and it was in his
[57:09] mouth it it it was there and the word
[57:13] never lost its Effectiveness to him it
[57:18] it never did uh uh you know years later
[57:22] he entered into the promised land and
[57:24] under the ministry of Joshua and and and
[57:28] that land was a land of rest do you
[57:30] believe that amen that's what brother
[57:32] Brown said it was a land of rest amen
[57:36] see out outside the land uh uh the
[57:39] children of Israel were just pilgrims
[57:41] and and strangers uh uh be you know
[57:45] brother said it because the land wasn't
[57:48] theirs amen see the land of Egypt wasn't
[57:52] Theirs to possess amen the land of the
[57:55] Wilderness wasn't THS to possess the
[57:57] land of Esau wasn't THS to possess uh
[58:01] and the land of Moab see it it wasn't
[58:04] their inheritance so they could not
[58:07] settle down and possess it it it wasn't
[58:10] a land of rest they had to keep moving
[58:13] they had to keep keep pressing ain't
[58:15] that right amen you know uh they they
[58:18] weren't able to settle down uh outside
[58:21] the land that God had given them others
[58:24] were settling down others were there
[58:27] enjoying it calling it home but they
[58:29] could not call it home they they could
[58:32] not because it wasn't their inheritance
[58:35] God told Israel that when you go through
[58:38] the land of of Esau don't don't mess
[58:41] with them don't fool around with them
[58:43] don't settle down with them you you know
[58:45] don't argue with them don't argue with
[58:47] Moab don't join up with them amen uh uh
[58:51] don't fuss with him see Israel were just
[58:54] passing through the land
[58:56] can you say Amen see and and and so it
[59:00] it was uh uh uh in the land of promise
[59:04] amen that's where their inheritance lay
[59:08] that's where the Word of Promise would
[59:11] take effect upon them and come into its
[59:15] full effect ain't that right so so and
[59:19] and and only in the land did the
[59:21] promises of God become a reality to them
[59:26] amen talking about it and being
[59:28] partakers of it is two different things
[59:31] talking about it talking about it
[59:33] talking about it but then there comes a
[59:35] time that they they would cross over
[59:38] into the land and partake of everything
[59:41] that God promised them see so now the
[59:45] prophet said Israel shouted and danced
[59:48] sure they had a great time but they
[59:51] found out they wandered for 40 years now
[59:53] in our wondering did you ever think of
[59:56] what they did out there in the
[59:57] wilderness did you ever think of what
[59:59] Israel done God blessed them sure uh uh
[1:00:03] see they had their Gardens their crops
[1:00:06] their married they married their wives
[1:00:09] they raised their children God blessed
[1:00:11] them and he's blessed the Pentecostal
[1:00:13] move and sure but remember that wasn't
[1:00:17] what God sent them out to live in the
[1:00:20] wilderness God never sent them to live
[1:00:22] in the wilderness yes they B blessed
[1:00:25] them and the all their Journey but they
[1:00:28] were not meant to to live in the land of
[1:00:31] Esau they were not meant to live in the
[1:00:33] land of Moab they they they weren't you
[1:00:36] know and so he says see they was just to
[1:00:39] pass through the Wilderness for they
[1:00:41] were on their road to the promised land
[1:00:45] can you say Amen they were on the road
[1:00:48] to the promised land and never as as far
[1:00:51] as I can read in scripture never do you
[1:00:53] find a Caleb a man trying to possess
[1:00:56] something outside of the land of
[1:00:58] inheritance amen never did he you find
[1:01:01] him in the land of Esau saying give me
[1:01:04] my Mountain I want this I got to have
[1:01:06] that no no that was Esau's to possess
[1:01:08] can you say amen amen and we must
[1:01:11] understand that amen God blesses people
[1:01:14] God blesses with with all kinds of
[1:01:16] things you say well how are they
[1:01:17] prospering and they're Sinners and
[1:01:19] they're and they're liars and they're
[1:01:21] this and they're that that may be their
[1:01:23] inheritance can you say Amen amen that's
[1:01:27] right see and so when a so when when a
[1:01:30] man crosses over into the land of
[1:01:33] promise see then what happens he doesn't
[1:01:36] live to possess Earthly things amen this
[1:01:40] world means nothing to him amen he's
[1:01:43] he's not out to possess Amen in the
[1:01:46] promise it was Caleb that wanted his
[1:01:50] inheritance can you say amen he wasn't
[1:01:53] looking out in the land saying man I was
[1:01:56] I could have that whatever Esau had and
[1:01:58] and I wish I could have this and I wish
[1:02:00] I could have had what Moab and him had
[1:02:02] bo if we could just if we could just act
[1:02:04] like a MOAB and and if we could just no
[1:02:07] no no no Caleb realized there was an
[1:02:11] inheritance in that land for him can you
[1:02:15] say amen amen see so so he he possesses
[1:02:20] in the land he possesses his inheritance
[1:02:24] and so that's what we read about of
[1:02:26] Caleb he had stood the test I believe
[1:02:29] God every promise is right we're more
[1:02:31] than able to overcome and because of his
[1:02:35] faith God brought him into that land of
[1:02:38] inheritance and everyone else the word
[1:02:41] would become non effect to them but
[1:02:43] everything that God promised would now
[1:02:46] become AFF Caleb and he realize that
[1:02:50] he's sitting there in the land of
[1:02:52] promise and now he wants to possess what
[1:02:55] is his ain't that right amen now you
[1:02:58] never find Caleb amen I believe Caleb
[1:03:00] knew what was his and what you know I I
[1:03:02] believe he knew he entered in that land
[1:03:04] knowing what was his he didn't go around
[1:03:07] and and wondering now what do I do now
[1:03:09] which one is mine well I think I want
[1:03:11] that and Ephraim says oh no you can't
[1:03:13] have that that's mine Joshua gave that
[1:03:14] to me really well you know and so he's
[1:03:18] wanting this and he wanting oh he knew
[1:03:20] exactly what God had given him ain't
[1:03:23] that right see and and so now we we read
[1:03:27] this last uh uh Wednesday to inherit
[1:03:30] something is to come into possession of
[1:03:34] or receive especially as a right or
[1:03:37] Divine portion see so then for you to
[1:03:41] have an inheritance God or someone has
[1:03:44] to leave you something and and and as
[1:03:47] we've been taught God did leave us
[1:03:49] something and when he left it he left it
[1:03:52] before the foundation of the world not
[1:03:55] when you come to the altar not when you
[1:03:57] decided and and and and all of a sudden
[1:03:59] you started acknowledging him he left
[1:04:02] you something before the foundation of
[1:04:05] the world and you don't have to work for
[1:04:07] it you don't have to beg for it it's
[1:04:09] yours because someone gave it to you can
[1:04:13] you say Amen now Caleb's inheritance was
[1:04:16] given by the word of the Lord amen
[1:04:19] that's right wasn't no denomination or
[1:04:21] anything like that see amen and and and
[1:04:24] therefore he knew it had to be sure
[1:04:27] because God had promised it it come from
[1:04:30] the the the mouth of a prophet amen
[1:04:33] therefore he was so confident in it that
[1:04:36] he laid claim to it laid claim he knew
[1:04:39] it was given to him ain't that right now
[1:04:42] we can we can relate Amen to this uh uh
[1:04:46] those of us um who are really truly
[1:04:50] following the message of the hour and I
[1:04:52] I believe all of us are amen but we can
[1:04:55] relate to Caleb's desire to possess what
[1:04:58] was given to him because we have been
[1:05:01] given an inheritance as well ain't that
[1:05:04] right amen look Believers and and I just
[1:05:07] what what the prophet or what the Bible
[1:05:09] says Believers are ordained to eternal
[1:05:12] life when was you ordained before the
[1:05:15] foundation of the world God left you
[1:05:17] eternal life do you believe that amen
[1:05:21] Believers are predestinated they're
[1:05:23] called they're just ified and they're
[1:05:26] already
[1:05:28] glorified when before the foundation of
[1:05:31] the world God left you something back
[1:05:34] then amen we're predestinated to the
[1:05:37] adoption of sons how many believes that
[1:05:40] we're predestinated God left us this as
[1:05:43] an inheritance for us our inheritance
[1:05:46] was predestinated to us as Paul would
[1:05:49] tell us and we were predestinated to
[1:05:52] obtain our inheritance yes sir you see
[1:05:56] we were predestinated to become to be
[1:05:59] conformed to the To His Image amen not
[1:06:02] only that but an eternal city has been
[1:06:05] prepared for us do you believe that amen
[1:06:08] remember there's a city that is coming
[1:06:10] down amen but there's also a people
[1:06:13] that's ordained to live in that City
[1:06:16] amen that is your inheritance before the
[1:06:19] foundation of the world the changing of
[1:06:21] our body amen from corruption to
[1:06:24] incorruption was left us before the
[1:06:27] foundation of the world the sons of God
[1:06:30] ruling and reigning amen not only in
[1:06:33] this life but in the life to come in
[1:06:36] this life our Dominion is a dominion
[1:06:38] over sin a ain't that right amen you
[1:06:41] don't have to wait till the next life
[1:06:43] you can Reign now and so is the believer
[1:06:46] reigning now over over sin amen but see
[1:06:50] something has been left us people don't
[1:06:53] believe in that predestination amen
[1:06:56] where you know how do you understand
[1:06:58] your inheritance amen your inheritance
[1:07:01] has been secure because God left it to
[1:07:04] you not what you done not what you will
[1:07:08] do but God by Grace left you an
[1:07:12] inheritance do you believe that see so
[1:07:16] so if you notice the promised land of
[1:07:19] the Old Testament represented the holy
[1:07:22] spirit amen now how do we know that we
[1:07:25] have an inheritance well and and
[1:07:28] Ephesians 1:13-14
[1:07:31] it uh you know it it Paul would tell us
[1:07:34] that the Holy Ghost is the earnest
[1:07:36] everybody say the earnest it's the
[1:07:38] earnest or down payment of our
[1:07:42] inheritance until the Redemption uh of
[1:07:45] the purchased possession amen so that's
[1:07:49] what the Holy Ghost is when you you come
[1:07:51] into a land it is your down payment you
[1:07:55] that's what when you receive the Holy
[1:07:56] Ghost it's a down payment and and and
[1:07:59] the word down payment is a pledge that
[1:08:02] the full amount will be paid amen The
[1:08:06] Pledge that the full amount will be paid
[1:08:09] you see when God gave you the Holy Ghost
[1:08:11] he is so serious about you that he says
[1:08:14] I'm going to give it to you as a
[1:08:16] guarantee that you're going to make it
[1:08:18] amen I now God already knows you're
[1:08:20] going to make it but he gave you a
[1:08:22] guarantee he gave the world a guarantee
[1:08:25] that you brother Matthew are going to
[1:08:27] make it it's a down payment of your
[1:08:30] inheritance of your full inheritance can
[1:08:33] you sayen see so when God filled you
[1:08:36] with the Holy Ghost he confirmed to you
[1:08:39] that you have an inheritance you have an
[1:08:42] inh glad you got an inheritance amen we
[1:08:45] you think the Holy Ghost was uh make us
[1:08:47] feel good and got you know uh uh chill
[1:08:49] bumps and and shouted and got emotional
[1:08:53] amen but but brother BR is it all you
[1:08:55] know that power went all out the Smoke
[1:08:57] Stack you know because people didn't
[1:08:58] know what they had amen but we're
[1:09:01] beginning to understand that the holy
[1:09:03] goals is a confirmation to us that we do
[1:09:06] have an
[1:09:08] inheritance yes sir we got an
[1:09:10] inheritance brother BR said the holy
[1:09:12] spirit is the assurance that we have
[1:09:14] been received into Christ Christ the
[1:09:17] land of promise you believe Christ is
[1:09:19] that Land Of Promise Christ well Paul
[1:09:22] says here in 2 Corinthians 1:20 all the
[1:09:25] promises of God in him in that land are
[1:09:29] yay and
[1:09:30] amen amen that's right now now brother
[1:09:33] Brown says people outside the land knows
[1:09:35] nothing about what's in the land amen
[1:09:38] but when you're in that land you know
[1:09:40] what it's all about every promise is a
[1:09:43] guarantee to you ain't that right it's
[1:09:47] yay and amen in him amen see so brother
[1:09:51] Brandon goes on it is the Blessed hope
[1:09:53] and assurance that we do have have
[1:09:55] eternal life and are HS of everything
[1:09:59] that he purchased for us see so we have
[1:10:03] been baptized into Christ one body ain't
[1:10:07] that right by a spiritual baptism yes
[1:10:11] sir the Holy Ghost so brother brandom
[1:10:13] says see we we have the earnest now of
[1:10:17] our complete everybody say
[1:10:20] complete complete
[1:10:22] inheritance your inheritance is is the
[1:10:25] Eternal things your inheritance is the
[1:10:28] supernatural things your inheritance
[1:10:31] isn't a truck you know you you say well
[1:10:34] I received an inheritance from a natural
[1:10:36] family and all that but do you realize
[1:10:39] the inheritance that God gave you is far
[1:10:41] greater than a natural
[1:10:44] inheritance Moses was able Moses was
[1:10:47] supposed to inherit the throne but
[1:10:50] brother brandom says The Inheritance
[1:10:51] that he had inside of him was greater
[1:10:54] than the natural
[1:10:55] inheritance think of it he was supposed
[1:10:57] to inherit a a superworld a superpower
[1:11:01] he was going to inherit a a a throne
[1:11:04] that he could sit on and rule the world
[1:11:08] Amen but yet that inheritance in him was
[1:11:11] greater than that amen and God's The
[1:11:14] Inheritance that God has given you is so
[1:11:16] far greater than a mansion it's so far
[1:11:19] greater than the all the wealth of the
[1:11:21] world it's so far greater than the Hun
[1:11:24] new hunting bow you know that you could
[1:11:26] have it it's so far greater than than
[1:11:29] the the biggest buck that you can hang
[1:11:31] on your wall amen it's so far greater
[1:11:34] than all the riches you understand what
[1:11:37] I'm saying amen it it it it's an
[1:11:39] inheritance that God has given you amen
[1:11:43] see now he says see we have the earnest
[1:11:46] now the down payment of our complete
[1:11:50] everybody say complete again inheritance
[1:11:53] because God has already he pulled loose
[1:11:56] the grounded roots from the things of
[1:11:58] the world and has planted us on Higher
[1:12:00] Grounds see Lifted Me Out transformed me
[1:12:04] from the things of the world took out
[1:12:05] roots branches everything uh the things
[1:12:08] of the world see and lifted me up out of
[1:12:11] the my re clay out of the old muck of
[1:12:14] sin and planted me on top of Zion's Hill
[1:12:18] setting in the orchard of the Beloved
[1:12:20] saints of God and now we are citizens of
[1:12:23] that Kingdom brother and Sisters in
[1:12:26] Christ Jesus all filth and gum and
[1:12:29] nastiness has gone from our minds aren't
[1:12:33] you glad for that amen that you're
[1:12:35] living in a world of filthiness of
[1:12:38] perversion but God has so done something
[1:12:41] to you that that's gone out of your mind
[1:12:44] you can be tempted sure amen but it's
[1:12:47] gone it's not attaching itself to you
[1:12:49] because that's not your
[1:12:53] inheritance he said our B are washed
[1:12:55] with pure water and our hearts are
[1:12:58] sprinkled by the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:13:01] and the Holy Spirit is abiding with his
[1:13:03] Breeze blowing through our branches all
[1:13:05] day long shoving us pushing us making us
[1:13:07] take good roots and grow down deep that
[1:13:10] the earnest of our in Salvation ain't
[1:13:12] that right so what is the Holy Ghost
[1:13:15] it's the earnest of our uh uh
[1:13:17] inheritance the down payment it's also a
[1:13:20] seal it it it it also signifies a
[1:13:24] finished work
[1:13:25] a security ain't that right so it's
[1:13:28] telling you you can never be lost you
[1:13:32] can't be lost can you say amen amen and
[1:13:36] and and so brother Bram said see a seal
[1:13:38] means that it is a finished thing with
[1:13:41] God it's already settled and every
[1:13:44] believer was sealed with this promise
[1:13:46] from the very beginning because before
[1:13:49] the foundation of the world we were
[1:13:51] predestinated unto the adoption of sons
[1:13:54] aren't you glad for that see God knew
[1:13:57] that you were coming he knew that amen
[1:14:00] then he gives you his seal see so so God
[1:14:04] claims you a man uh shows a claim upon
[1:14:08] you when he fills you with the Holy
[1:14:10] Ghost brother brah said see when this
[1:14:13] new eternal life dwells in you it is the
[1:14:16] potential or the earnest of you being
[1:14:18] quickened from Mortal to immortality
[1:14:22] we're talking about our inheritance
[1:14:23] right amen see a full inheritance amen
[1:14:28] this is why we shout this is why we're
[1:14:30] excited this is why when tribulation is
[1:14:33] setting in we know there's a we that
[1:14:36] ain't our future we've got an
[1:14:38] inheritance and even though death and
[1:14:40] Corruption is setting in this body and
[1:14:42] it may we may go by the way of the Grave
[1:14:45] which I just don't think we will amen I
[1:14:47] mean I believe there's people that are
[1:14:49] alive on the Earth today that will never
[1:14:51] taste death that's just how I feel about
[1:14:54] it we we are that close to the coming of
[1:14:56] the Lord but if we were to go by the way
[1:14:59] of a grave there is a down payment in
[1:15:02] our soul amen that will Quicken this old
[1:15:05] body and raise us up into
[1:15:09] immortality yes sir so he says see he
[1:15:13] said Quicken from Mortal to immortality
[1:15:15] let me say that again when this Spirit
[1:15:17] has found you the individual and has
[1:15:20] come upon you it is the potential of
[1:15:22] your Eternal inheritance that God
[1:15:25] thought of you and made for you before
[1:15:28] the foundation of the world and that is
[1:15:30] your potential aren't you glad for that
[1:15:33] amen so what is the Holy Ghost today
[1:15:36] amen it's the Easter seal you go listen
[1:15:39] to the uh uh the Easter seal uh listen
[1:15:43] to rising of the sun listen to them
[1:15:46] messages uh but he tells us it's the
[1:15:48] Easter seal it's the
[1:15:51] Dynamics everybody say Dynamics it's
[1:15:54] putting you in
[1:15:55] a a position amen see and and so what is
[1:15:59] that it's proof that you are risen with
[1:16:02] Christ and that you are a new creature
[1:16:06] and the word has been quickened to
[1:16:10] you oh aren't you glad for that it's
[1:16:13] been quickened to you it is the earnest
[1:16:16] of your inheritance brother Brown said
[1:16:19] we have the evidence that God Lives we
[1:16:21] have the evidence that God is with us we
[1:16:24] have the evidence that God has not
[1:16:26] forsaken us and that we are his and he
[1:16:30] is ours see and so then we have the Holy
[1:16:35] Spirit within us crying out Abba Father
[1:16:39] oh aren't you glad for that see so and
[1:16:42] there's nothing that can ever take that
[1:16:44] away from us brother Brown said the
[1:16:46] trees don't have it the the flowers do
[1:16:49] not have it nature does not have it
[1:16:52] we're the one that has it amen all
[1:16:54] nature doesn't have it but we have the
[1:16:57] earnest of our inheritance now notice
[1:17:00] yet we're still groaning we're still
[1:17:02] groaning with them we're groaning with
[1:17:04] the trees we're groaning with all nature
[1:17:06] because we have not yet received the
[1:17:09] fullness everybody say the fullness of
[1:17:12] our
[1:17:13] adoption we've not received the fullness
[1:17:17] of our adoption amen see amen uh uh now
[1:17:22] you know I I know brother brandom says
[1:17:24] that he he says this when a man receives
[1:17:26] the Holy Spirit then his time of
[1:17:28] groaning is over because it is a
[1:17:30] finished work and that is so true amen
[1:17:33] but see we're not wandering if we have
[1:17:35] an inheritance we know we've got it amen
[1:17:38] it's it's it's been given to us we've we
[1:17:41] we we've got that Assurance we we know
[1:17:43] we're saved we know amen that there's
[1:17:46] the devil cannot get to our soul we we
[1:17:48] know that whatever trial we go through
[1:17:50] whatever things he puts upon us we're
[1:17:52] going to make it do you believe that we
[1:17:54] we know that we have an inheritance and
[1:17:57] and that inheritance is an eternal
[1:17:59] inheritance we're not looking out in the
[1:18:00] world uh for our inheritance we're not
[1:18:03] looking in church denomination for our
[1:18:05] inheritance we're not we're not looking
[1:18:07] for things we're not looking at the
[1:18:09] politicians to give us our inheritance
[1:18:12] can you say amen amen that's right see
[1:18:15] we're not looking for a messiah to give
[1:18:18] us our inheritance we are in the land of
[1:18:22] rest we've come into the land of rest do
[1:18:25] you believe that the land of adoption
[1:18:29] but yet we will still not groan stop
[1:18:32] groaning until we've come to our full
[1:18:36] adoption we're not groaning to be a
[1:18:38] Christian we're not groaning amen for
[1:18:40] for these I hope you understand what I'm
[1:18:42] saying in other words see uh we we know
[1:18:46] that we're going to make it we're secure
[1:18:47] in that amen we're at rest it's a land
[1:18:51] of rest how many's in that land of rest

[1:19:31] says see now we have the earnest our
[1:19:33] Spirits groaning for the full adoption
[1:19:37] but now we have the earnest of it as we
[1:19:39] receive the Holy Spirit it is the
[1:19:41] earnest of our complete adoption or

[1:25:39] and and what is it doing it is
[1:25:41] quickening us our mortal bodies to the
[1:25:45] word of God in other words the word is
[1:25:48] becoming flesh in your flesh the word

[1:25:58] come into the Land There was a natural
[1:26:01] mountain and he possessed it amen and he
[1:26:04] lived there but the mountain that we're
[1:26:07] taking the things that we're the word is
[1:26:10] taking on
[1:26:11] flesh amen amen that's right can you say

[1:26:38] through the land of justification
[1:26:40] sanctification the baptism of the Holy
[1:26:43] Ghost in This last days but it was not
[1:26:46] to settle down there it was to keep
[1:26:49] moving on moving on you believe that yes
[1:26:52] sir had to keep on moving the Lutheran
[1:26:54] settled down the Wesleyan settled down
[1:26:57] the the Pentecostals settled down and
[1:26:59] and all these things brother Bram said
[1:27:01] each one of those ages had a dip of the
[1:27:04] Holy Ghost of the Holy Spirit but what
[1:27:06] is it they didn't go all the way into it
[1:27:09] if if if Luther would have kept on
[1:27:11] moving he would have been Wesley yeah if
[1:27:13] Wesley would have kept on moving it
[1:27:15] would been Pentecostals and if the
[1:27:17] Pentecostals would have kept on moving
[1:27:19] that'd be what we are
[1:27:20] today they would have come into the land
[1:27:24] yeah amen can you say amen that's right
[1:27:27] see the true church of today what is the
[1:27:30] true church of today not a Pentecostal
[1:27:33] age the true church of today is in the
[1:27:37] promised
[1:27:38] land possessing their
[1:27:42] inheritance people that's not in that
[1:27:44] land you know they're looking at all the
[1:27:46] politics they're looking at everything
[1:27:47] that this world can give them and
[1:27:49] they're satisfied with that that's what
[1:27:51] they want that's what they're thriving
[1:27:53] on
[1:27:55] give me give me give me let me hear them
[1:27:58] promises but in those that are in the
[1:28:01] land they know the promise doesn't come
[1:28:04] from a politician the promise comes from
[1:28:08] God and it's not something materialistic
[1:28:11] it's something that is quickening
[1:28:14] them becoming part of them that's right
[1:28:17] can you say Amen yes sir the true church
[1:28:20] of today is in the promised land Church
[1:28:24] justification brother Brown said made a
[1:28:26] way for sanctification sanctification
[1:28:28] made a way for the baptism of the Holy
[1:28:30] Ghost the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:28:32] notice now made a way for the Holy Ghost
[1:28:35] itself to come right down in
[1:28:39] Perfection back to the word again to
[1:28:43] manifest itself can you say Amen we we
[1:28:47] had to go through the land of
[1:28:48] justification we have to go through the
[1:28:50] land of sanctification we have to go
[1:28:52] through the land of Pentecost
[1:28:54] Amen to get where we are
[1:28:58] today that's right are you with me
[1:29:02] sir yes sir give me my
[1:29:05] Mountain Caleb didn't represent Luther
[1:29:09] right give me my Mountain he represent
[1:29:13] he wasn't a type of the methodists he
[1:29:15] wasn't a type of the Pentecostals and
[1:29:17] the baptism then I'm he's a type of
[1:29:20] you this last day bride that is
[1:29:23] following this end time message give me
[1:29:26] my
[1:29:28] Mountain believe now the 10
[1:29:33] spies I believe they were a type of the
[1:29:36] Pentecostals of this last day oh yeah
[1:29:38] the Pentecostal
[1:29:40] age they went into the land and partook
[1:29:44] of the Holy Spirit see they went into
[1:29:47] the land they partook of the evidence of
[1:29:49] the land and they came back with an evil
[1:29:53] report
[1:29:55] right they partook of the land they saw
[1:29:59] the manifestation of God in this day
[1:30:02] they saw the ministry of Messiah of
[1:30:05] Christ they saw the Messiah sign
[1:30:09] hello and they called her the
[1:30:13] devil they partook of the Holy
[1:30:16] Ghost think about it but when the Holy
[1:30:19] Ghost himself
[1:30:20] came amen they rejected it
[1:30:24] ain't that right see so they went into
[1:30:27] the land partook of the Holy Spirit but
[1:30:29] did not come into its fullness yes sir
[1:30:33] now Hebrews 6:4 for it is impossible for
[1:30:36] those who were once enlightened and have
[1:30:37] tasted of the Heavenly gift and were
[1:30:39] made partakers of the Holy Ghost and
[1:30:42] have tasted the good word of God and the
[1:30:44] powers of the world to come if they
[1:30:47] shall fall away to renew themselves to
[1:30:49] renew them again unto repentance see uh
[1:30:52] uh seeing they crucified to themselves
[1:30:55] the Son of God aresh and put him to an
[1:30:57] open shame now notice what brother Brown
[1:30:59] says ye who have tasted the Heavenly
[1:31:01] gift tasted in other words you've seen
[1:31:05] it amen many people know that this
[1:31:08] message is the
[1:31:10] truth on
[1:31:13] now that's right they tasted see you've
[1:31:16] seen it you can't and then brother
[1:31:18] Braham smacks his lips together you
[1:31:20] can't just taste it with your mouth but
[1:31:23] you seen it and you knew it was the
[1:31:26] truth you know it was the truth tasted
[1:31:29] the Heavenly gift and made partakers of
[1:31:32] the Holy Spirit as it fell upon you
[1:31:36] speaking in tongues
[1:31:38] prophesying can you say Amen none not
[1:31:42] all of that was
[1:31:43] fake them were genuine things remember
[1:31:46] brother Ram goes to that meeting he
[1:31:48] never been into a Pentecostal meeting
[1:31:49] and and them two men one of them spoke
[1:31:52] in tongues the other one prophesied and
[1:31:53] was exactly right on word for word
[1:31:56] everything just right he thought man
[1:31:58] I've never seen this before he thought I
[1:31:59] come in the in the midst of angels and
[1:32:02] he and he and he said I got to meet
[1:32:04] these two men and and he shook he said
[1:32:06] he had that gift you know shook that one
[1:32:09] man's hand he said it was a genuine that
[1:32:11] man was a genuine believer and he
[1:32:13] thought oh wow that's incredible so he
[1:32:15] went and met that other man shook his
[1:32:17] hand he said if I ever met a devil that
[1:32:19] was
[1:32:21] one can you say Amen see and so see
[1:32:25] partakers of the Holy Spirit as a fell
[1:32:27] upon you tasted of the good word of God
[1:32:29] see taste it you seen it was right the
[1:32:32] Holy Ghost Fallen upon you the weed in
[1:32:34] the field and then turn away denying the
[1:32:37] very Christ that Sanctified you called
[1:32:40] you and put that anointing upon you
[1:32:42] there remaineth no more sacrifice for
[1:32:44] sin for that see it's imp paron
[1:32:47] unpardonable it's impossible for them to
[1:32:50] ever come to the knowledge of Truth
[1:32:53] think of that now it's impossible for
[1:32:56] them to ever come to the knowledge of
[1:32:58] the truth in other words the word being
[1:33:00] made open unto them see for it is
[1:33:03] impossible for those made who were made
[1:33:06] partakers of the Holy Spirit see it fell
[1:33:08] upon the weed started in with Jesus and
[1:33:11] saiding oh Lord I'm going through but
[1:33:13] when you hit that word you turn back see
[1:33:16] made partakers of the Holy Spirit even
[1:33:19] tasted or seen the word itself
[1:33:22] manifested and then turn away from it
[1:33:25] it's totally impossible for them to ever
[1:33:27] see it or come to it well that's exactly
[1:33:30] what happened to the 10 spies ain't that
[1:33:32] right they saw the word they knew the
[1:33:35] evidence of the land they knew it was
[1:33:37] right amen but the Giants their their
[1:33:40] evil heart of unbelief caused them to
[1:33:44] give an evil report and to turn from
[1:33:47] what Moses was saying and God says
[1:33:49] you'll never partake of it you'll never
[1:33:52] come into the fullness of it they can
[1:33:54] you say amen and God turned that
[1:33:56] Pentecostal shuck
[1:33:59] away and the Pentecostal Shu lays dead
[1:34:03] today but there is a
[1:34:06] people there is a
[1:34:09] Caleb there is a Young
[1:34:12] Generation that has come out of
[1:34:15] that and has entered into the promised
[1:34:18] land and what if they come to the
[1:34:20] fullness everybody say the fullness of
[1:34:24] the word fullness of the word that's why
[1:34:27] our hope is so real that's why we we we
[1:34:30] we I know I keep saying it but maybe
[1:34:33] it's just a critical time that's why
[1:34:35] we're not looking to politicians that's
[1:34:37] why we are not looking to government
[1:34:39] that's why we're not looking to all
[1:34:40] these things it does not matter to us we
[1:34:44] are in the land of inheritance God says
[1:34:48] I'm the god that Health thee I'm the god
[1:34:51] that provides all thy needs can you say
[1:34:54] Amen yes sir see so this is the day this
[1:34:58] is the day everybody say this is the day
[1:35:00] when the word has come to its full
[1:35:03] effect sir that's good that's why we're
[1:35:06] looking for a land Yonder that's why we
[1:35:09] are so you know so enthused and so
[1:35:13] excited and looking every day for the
[1:35:15] Rapture to come that's our inheritance
[1:35:18] we now are in the land praise the Lord I
[1:35:23] love it
[1:35:24] when Jesus walked the Earth the word had
[1:35:26] come to into full effect that day the
[1:35:30] scriptures were
[1:35:31] fulfilled concerning the Messiah Jesus
[1:35:35] said search the scriptures in them you
[1:35:37] think you have eternal life but they
[1:35:38] testify of me ain't that right the
[1:35:41] scriptures testified of him him him no
[1:35:44] longer was it a messiah coming he was
[1:35:47] the Messiah and every scripture was
[1:35:50] fulfilled in him
[1:35:53] and they turned it down turned it down
[1:35:56] and they died yeah can you say Amen see
[1:35:59] they turned it down now notice the
[1:36:01] prophet said the church was to go on to
[1:36:03] the full promise everybody say full
[1:36:05] promise they were to go on to the full
[1:36:08] promise it should be in her Splendor of
[1:36:12] Glory she should be waiting for the
[1:36:14] coming of the Lord instead of that she
[1:36:16] scattered everywhere wondering which is
[1:36:19] right looking for a politician to come
[1:36:22] and save her looking for this to come
[1:36:24] and save her no they should be in your
[1:36:28] spot looking for the coming of the Lord
[1:36:31] but they turn that word down but here we
[1:36:34] are we're not looking for the the the
[1:36:37] blessings of man we are looking to God
[1:36:41] for the Bible says when you see these
[1:36:43] things begin to happen lift up your head

[1:37:15] is that right I'll join this I'll go
[1:37:17] over here I'll go down there see next
[1:37:20] place he says and the first resurrection
[1:37:22] will come for forth for the bright age
[1:37:24] for a resurrection out of dark
[1:37:28] denominationalism everyone that has
[1:37:30] turned it down they have they have
[1:37:31] followed right in the cycle of every age
[1:37:34] but not
[1:37:35] us there has come a resurrection for the
[1:37:39] first time out of dark
[1:37:41] denominationalism will be a message that
[1:37:44] the full
[1:37:46] maturity of the word has turned back
[1:37:49] again in its full power amen being waved
[1:37:53] over the People by the sign same signs
[1:37:55] and wonders that he did back there now
[1:37:58] listen church today we as a group of
[1:38:02] people and I'm not just talking about
[1:38:04] Faith Tabernacle I'm talking about
[1:38:05] Believers all around this world we are
[1:38:08] no longer passing through the
[1:38:12] land
[1:38:13] Hallelujah are you with me we're not
[1:38:17] just passing through the land there's no
[1:38:20] other Church ages left there's no time
[1:38:23] left left we have entered in the land of
[1:38:27] promise can you say
[1:38:31] Amen on not passing through the land we
[1:38:34] are in the land of inheritance and how
[1:38:38] did we get there by the message of the
[1:38:40] hour the Joshua Ministry has taken us
[1:38:43] over into the land of
[1:38:46] promise Lord now as we've said brother
[1:38:49] Brams talked about it how that land was
[1:38:52] it it was the second part part of
[1:38:53] redemption you read Exodus and that
[1:38:56] deals of e Egypt coming Israel coming
[1:38:59] out of Egypt that was the first part of
[1:39:01] redemption but Redemption has two
[1:39:04] parts it wouldn't be a full Redemption
[1:39:07] if if God left them in the wilderness
[1:39:10] I'm talking about the believer now that
[1:39:11] elect yeah that's right but Caleb showed
[1:39:15] that there would be a group of people
[1:39:17] come from the first first Exodus and
[1:39:20] enter first part of redemption but they
[1:39:22] would also go into the second part of
[1:39:25] redemption and that is when they entered
[1:39:27] into the land of promise their
[1:39:29] inheritance now in in in so it has two
[1:39:32] parts Redemption has two parts coming
[1:39:34] out and going into now in the message
[1:39:37] Paradox brother brandham spoke of the
[1:39:39] vision that he had of him standing on
[1:39:41] the map of Palestine and he says I I was
[1:39:44] coming to Down To The River Jordan he
[1:39:47] said he could hear the song being sung
[1:39:49] I'm going down to the Jordan and as he
[1:39:52] drew near to the Jordan River which
[1:39:55] Jordan means death and remember Israel
[1:39:58] had to cross in order to get into the
[1:40:00] promised land they had to cross the
[1:40:01] river of Jordan ain't that right see and
[1:40:05] and so as he drew near the Jordan River
[1:40:08] he said I look back from where I came
[1:40:10] from I looked back to where I had been
[1:40:14] and he said I realized I had come 2third
[1:40:17] of the way W which showing him that he
[1:40:20] had come already come from first and
[1:40:22] second pull
[1:40:24] and now he's looking at what was ahead
[1:40:27] and he says to himself he said oh praise
[1:40:30] God just on the other side is where all
[1:40:34] the promises lay every promise lays in
[1:40:38] the promised
[1:40:40] land can you say Amen promises in the
[1:40:44] third
[1:40:46] pool can you say amen and we know the
[1:40:50] third pool is the opening of the word
[1:40:53] yes sir the word had been shut up that's
[1:40:57] right but now it's time for the word to
[1:41:00] be open every promise in the
[1:41:04] book being revealed and we see our name
[1:41:08] in the
[1:41:12] book amen our inheritance Mage can you
[1:41:16] say Amen yes sir now brother brandham
[1:41:20] also showed or the Lord showed brother
[1:41:22] brandham that his ministry was Joshua
[1:41:26] Ministry remember he had been praying in
[1:41:28] a hand I believe or a Bible and a hand
[1:41:30] come down I don't know exactly how that
[1:41:32] went but if you you've studied it you
[1:41:34] know it but a hand come down the Bible
[1:41:37] opened before him and it fell upon
[1:41:39] Joshua and a hand came down and started
[1:41:43] uh uh showing him the scriptures as I
[1:41:45] was with Moses so shall I be with thee
[1:41:48] you know fear not be courageous you you
[1:41:50] know you know the and and brother Brown
[1:41:53] understood himself to be have that
[1:41:57] Joshua Ministry that would take the
[1:41:59] people over into the promised land
[1:42:02] Pentecostals had rejected it they had
[1:42:05] rejected the message they had rejected
[1:42:07] the promises
[1:42:09] hello yes sir they saw the Messiah sign
[1:42:13] didn't want nothing to do with
[1:42:15] it too afraid of the
[1:42:17] Giants afraid that's going to be kicked
[1:42:19] out and living under a bridge afraid
[1:42:21] they were going to lose their popul it
[1:42:23] afraid they're going to be called a
[1:42:25] fanatic all these things but Caleb
[1:42:27] didn't care he just knew he was going
[1:42:30] over God would take care of everything
[1:42:33] and I say to you don't fear for your
[1:42:35] life don't be afraid of your future
[1:42:37] don't be afraid of tomorrow don't be
[1:42:39] afraid of what the enemy can do oh
[1:42:42] church God will take care of
[1:42:45] you he's taking care of us now now
[1:42:49] Church Satan is trying his best to keep
[1:42:52] the message from getting to the hearts
[1:42:53] of the
[1:42:55] elect this message reveals what belongs
[1:42:58] to us amen it is positionally placing Us
[1:43:02] in the land can you say Amen yes sir
[1:43:05] have you ever noticed that when Caleb
[1:43:07] got into the land or when Israel got
[1:43:10] into the land of promise it was then
[1:43:12] that the enemy become a real reality to
[1:43:15] them the inheritance become a reality to
[1:43:18] them but the enemy become a reality to
[1:43:20] them the enemy was bigger than than they
[1:43:23] were they were they were on every side
[1:43:26] yeah right there was the old cities it
[1:43:29] it was real
[1:43:31] obstacles hello yes sir see the children
[1:43:35] of Israel they just didn't come in there
[1:43:36] and walk in there and it was just a
[1:43:38] breeze they had the enemy to deal
[1:43:42] with yes come on now have you ever
[1:43:45] noticed why demonic spirits are
[1:43:48] manifesting themselves more today than
[1:43:51] ever before that's right
[1:43:53] that's true you're dealing with enemy
[1:43:56] that is far greater than any other age
[1:44:00] true yes you've come into your land
[1:44:04] yes and the enemy not only is the
[1:44:07] promises now I don't know about you but
[1:44:11] if you if you were in a in a
[1:44:14] denomination or just a church outside
[1:44:16] the message and all
[1:44:18] that I guarantee you and well I know you
[1:44:21] didn't have no understanding of this
[1:44:24] Bible but when God LED you to the
[1:44:26] message and not only just LED you to the
[1:44:28] message but through the message of the
[1:44:30] hour began to open up the promises to
[1:44:32] you this Bible become a new book that's
[1:44:35] right brother bradam said it become a
[1:44:36] new book to him why because things began
[1:44:39] to unfold this book become
[1:44:42] revealed it wasn't a book of History it
[1:44:44] was a book of
[1:44:45] today and and the Bible says that when
[1:44:48] the lamb come down with that open book
[1:44:50] John looked upon that book and he
[1:44:53] shouted and he danced and he and he and
[1:44:55] he glorified God you all know the story
[1:44:57] there in Revelations 5 and brother BR
[1:45:00] says because John must have seen his
[1:45:02] name something was revealed to him so
[1:45:06] the inheritance our inheritance now has
[1:45:09] been revealed to us and it's becoming
[1:45:11] more and more clear and and every
[1:45:13] promise is becoming
[1:45:15] personal it's not just the Lord is
[1:45:17] coming he's coming for me it's not just
[1:45:20] the Rapture is coming I'm coming in that
[1:45:22] rapt
[1:45:25] can you say man it's becoming personal
[1:45:27] but as the promises are becoming more
[1:45:29] real to us the enem is becoming more
[1:45:32] real that's right this isn't you know I
[1:45:35] mean Satan ain't just a figment of your
[1:45:37] imagination it's real amen that's true
[1:45:41] what is it they're trying their best to
[1:45:42] keep us from our inheritance trying to
[1:45:45] keep that word from being
[1:45:47] fulfilled can you say
[1:45:49] Amen yes sir they're trying but brother
[1:45:53] R said this he said you know he says
[1:45:55] there ain't enough devils in hell to
[1:45:57] keep us from doing it amen we were for
[1:46:00] ordained of God for this hour if the
[1:46:03] word of God manifest itself right
[1:46:05] through US amen amen aren't you glad for
[1:46:08] that he saids see when you say you're
[1:46:10] going to do anything going to accept
[1:46:13] your healing or going to accept you know
[1:46:16] the baptism of Holy Ghost that's when
[1:46:18] the devil flies on you with all four
[1:46:21] feet yeah
[1:46:24] yes when you say I'm going to draw
[1:46:25] closer to
[1:46:28] God don't think you just going to do it
[1:46:30] with by bre with a breeze Devil's going
[1:46:33] to jump all over you
[1:46:35] and beat the tar out of you if he
[1:46:40] can I'm going to stand for my
[1:46:43] healing that's when the devil's going to
[1:46:45] fly upon you sure he will think about it
[1:46:49] yeah hello yeah
[1:46:52] he said see he says now we're
[1:46:55] longing we're longing for somewhere
[1:46:57] where there's no death no sorrow no
[1:47:00] heartaches no old age that land is
[1:47:03] somewhere how many believes that that
[1:47:05] land is somewhere that's not
[1:47:09] America oh no and we'll never be able to
[1:47:13] achieve it by guns and fighting and so
[1:47:16] forth of the carnal natural carnal
[1:47:19] weapon but there is a land that we can
[1:47:21] go to and it's a a battle to get there
[1:47:24] that's
[1:47:25] right when God gave Israel Palestine
[1:47:28] when he was in
[1:47:30] Egypt they had to fight for every inch
[1:47:32] of it he told Joshua he said wherever
[1:47:36] the SES of your feet Treads upon that
[1:47:38] have I given you so Footprints means
[1:47:41] possession just keep walking walking
[1:47:45] pressing on and every time you make a
[1:47:47] step into the kingdom of God that's
[1:47:50] yours and all things are possible that's
[1:47:53] given and all things that are given is
[1:47:56] possible but it's a battle all right
[1:48:00] every day you wake up it's a battle but
[1:48:03] I like what brother Wayne said the other
[1:48:05] night he says don't surrender your
[1:48:08] faith don't re re surrender anything
[1:48:12] that God has given you keep pressing
[1:48:15] on let us be one that knows with courage
[1:48:19] that if God were to take us today
[1:48:21] tonight let our testimony ring out they
[1:48:25] never
[1:48:26] stopped they never quit they never gave
[1:48:29] up they kept
[1:48:33] pressing we are laying caim to Healing
[1:48:37] how many's laying
[1:48:39] claim we are laying claim to full
[1:48:42] Redemption full
[1:48:44] adoption we are laying claim to the
[1:48:47] Salvation of our family we are laying
[1:48:50] claim to Total deliverance we are laying
[1:48:53] claim to eternal life we are laying
[1:48:56] claim to that Eternal City we are laying
[1:48:59] claim to to uh uh an immortal body we
[1:49:04] are laying claim to the translation of
[1:49:07] our vow body and by faith we are laying
[1:49:11] claim to it everybody say by Faith by
[1:49:15] faith I'm laying claim to it I'm not I'm
[1:49:18] I'm not having to get a gun and shoot
[1:49:19] anybody I'm not having to try to kill
[1:49:22] people like you know Islam and all them
[1:49:24] they any enemy that they they want to be
[1:49:26] head they want to kill well that's not
[1:49:28] where we're fighting we're just laying
[1:49:31] Claim by
[1:49:33] faith it's mine it's mine can you say
[1:49:37] Amen see Israel as we close but Israel
[1:49:41] could not enter into the land of promise
[1:49:43] because of what unbelief unbelief
[1:49:47] unbelief see because they would never be
[1:49:50] able to whip their Giants they would
[1:49:52] never be able to overcome them world
[1:49:54] cities by unbelief it it had to be by
[1:49:58] faith ain't ain't that right see they
[1:50:01] would have become slaves to the enemy
[1:50:03] instead of overcoming the enemy see so
[1:50:06] so because God never required them to
[1:50:08] overcome on their own and God has never
[1:50:12] left you by yourself for you to overcome
[1:50:14] your enemy on your own it's by
[1:50:17] faith Say by Faith by faith therefore by
[1:50:23] their unbelief they had nothing to
[1:50:24] overcome with and and people that doubt
[1:50:28] God's word have nothing to overcome
[1:50:31] they'll never overcome they can be
[1:50:32] religious and still
[1:50:34] defeated they they can still go to
[1:50:36] church even set in the message church
[1:50:37] and still be
[1:50:40] defeated takes Faith amen Faith now
[1:50:43] notice Hebrews
[1:50:45] 10:38 now the just shall live by faith
[1:50:49] but if any man draw back my soul shall
[1:50:51] have no pleasure in in him but we are
[1:50:54] not of them who draw back under
[1:50:56] predition but of them that believe to
[1:50:59] the what the saving of the Soul right we
[1:51:04] believe to the saving of the Soul Romans
[1:51:08] 10:9 if Thou shalt confess with thy
[1:51:10] mouth the Lord Jesus and shalt believe
[1:51:13] in thine heart that God hath raised him
[1:51:15] from the dead Thou shalt be
[1:51:19] saved for with a heart man believeth
[1:51:22] under righteousness and with the mouth
[1:51:24] confession is made unto salvation amen
[1:51:28] so as we close if you believe it confess
[1:51:31] it if you believe it confess it can you
[1:51:34] say Amen see you cannot have it until
[1:51:38] you confess it you say oh I believe it
[1:51:41] though no no no from the heart man
[1:51:43] believeth and with the mouth confession
[1:51:45] is made can you say Amen so you cannot
[1:51:49] have it until you confess it why because
[1:51:52] is the high priest of your confession
[1:51:54] that's he's not the high priest of your
[1:51:57] good will your good intentions he's the
[1:51:59] high priest of your
[1:52:01] confession can you say amen and we
[1:52:04] already know that confession is a
[1:52:06] confession of faith for Paul says in
[1:52:08] that previous scripture that we read
[1:52:09] Romans 10:8 it's the word of faith which
[1:52:13] we preach and that word is NY even in
[1:52:16] thine heart and in thine mouth is so
[1:52:19] therefore the word that you speak is a
[1:52:21] confession of faith
[1:52:23] it's a word of faith that has come to
[1:52:25] you and it's a confession of faith that
[1:52:27] you speak that's right sure amen so what
[1:52:32] kind of a faith are we to have a faith
[1:52:35] that doesn't look at the situation and
[1:52:38] does not consider any circumstance amen
[1:52:41] do not Faith does not consider any
[1:52:44] circumstance right Faith does not look
[1:52:47] at how hard it is versus how easy it is
[1:52:51] Faith does not look at and and weigh the
[1:52:53] difference and weigh the odds and weigh
[1:52:55] it all out it doesn't look at all that
[1:52:57] it just looks at God's word so therefore
[1:53:01] the confession of faith it may be
[1:53:02] storming it may be whatever but the
[1:53:05] confession of Faith right in all of that
[1:53:08] God is with me God is for me I will make
[1:53:11] it I will go through it's a confession
[1:53:14] of Faith amen amen hallelujah so your
[1:53:19] confession doesn't regard the situation
[1:53:21] or conditions you realize that brother
[1:53:23] Braham said you will never live higher
[1:53:25] than your
[1:53:26] confession oh I just wish I could be a
[1:53:29] Christian I wish I could be an overcomer
[1:53:30] start confessing it everybody say that
[1:53:33] start confessing oh man I just wish my
[1:53:36] children could get saved well what are
[1:53:37] you doing what are you confessing oh
[1:53:40] they're getting worse they're getting
[1:53:40] worse quit quit confessing that you will
[1:53:44] never live higher than your
[1:53:47] confession that's good yes
[1:53:50] sir you realize that you're conf
[1:53:52] confession that saves
[1:53:56] you it's your confession that heals
[1:53:59] you it's your confession that delivers
[1:54:02] you it's your confession that goes to
[1:54:05] work and you'll never live higher than
[1:54:08] your confession that's right so get your
[1:54:11] confession out of the
[1:54:13] gutter come on now then you say amen
[1:54:17] amen if you brother BR said if you say
[1:54:20] I'm sick you're sick
[1:54:23] right the moment you believe and say
[1:54:27] that you're not saved he said that's the
[1:54:29] moment you're not
[1:54:30] saved don't confess negative amen you
[1:54:34] say but but man I've got so many faults
[1:54:36] don't confess it amen right that's right
[1:54:40] now this ain't mind over matter where
[1:54:41] you're ignoring
[1:54:42] it on
[1:54:45] Hello you understand that these things
[1:54:47] are there you understand that sickness
[1:54:49] is there if the doctor says you got
[1:54:50] cancer admit it you got it
[1:54:52] yeah but don't confess it confess that I
[1:54:56] am that God has healed
[1:54:59] [Music]
[1:55:00] me that's right brother brah says that
[1:55:03] you say you don't say you ain't got
[1:55:06] cancer I mean if you got cancer you got
[1:55:08] cancer if you got if you got sickness
[1:55:10] you got
[1:55:11] sickness hello yeah this ain't something
[1:55:14] that you're denying I mean you got it
[1:55:16] the symptoms are
[1:55:18] there but at the same time you ain't
[1:55:20] going to dwell on it God has healed
[1:55:27] me so the moment you say you're not
[1:55:29] going to make it you just ain't going to
[1:55:31] make it then cuz you'll never live
[1:55:33] higher than your confession amen you're
[1:55:35] taking your inheritance by the word of
[1:55:37] your mouth that's right can you say Amen
[1:55:40] brother BR said when you come to the
[1:55:42] altar what do you do you confess your
[1:55:44] sins and ask God to forgive you and then
[1:55:47] in your heart now get it in your heart
[1:55:49] you have to believe that he has forgiven
[1:55:51] you you have to believe that's right God
[1:55:55] help us to
[1:55:57] believe then you walk away from the
[1:56:00] platform then you have to confess it
[1:56:03] first that you are saved you just can't
[1:56:06] keep it under a bushel you'll lose it
[1:56:10] right now you've got to confess it and
[1:56:13] tell everyone that you're
[1:56:17] glad I think a lot of that is our
[1:56:20] problem is we're not confessing
[1:56:26] it's fine to talk about
[1:56:28] fishing it's fine to talk about huny and
[1:56:32] work and whatever you are and whatever
[1:56:34] you're involved in right tell people

[1:58:28] he said Divine Healing is the same way
[1:58:30] if the musicians will come he said now
[1:58:33] the only thing a minister can do would

[1:58:54] Jesus never did say did you feel it he
[1:58:56] said did you believe it it's by faith
[1:58:59] not by feeling you're not saved by
[1:59:01] feeling why the devil can beat you
[1:59:03] around to every stump in the country
[1:59:05] saying but it's by your feelings I'm not
[1:59:08] saved because I feel like I'm saved I'm
[1:59:10] saved because God's word said I'm saved
[1:59:13] and now listen he said the word of God
