[41:51] glad that there's Believers in this age
[41:53] that still believe a message

[42:23] told us you know um that it isn't the
[42:26] the preacher that comes and you know
[42:29] that does a performs the magic to us and
[42:33] all that and God's placed a gift in his
[42:35] life but it takes us as the people to
[42:38] create an atmosphere and to pull on the
[42:40] gift and um and you you always know when
[42:44] there's Believers around because they
[42:45] know how to do that and uh it's not a
[42:48] sideshow to us it's not just some trick
[42:52] amen that the preacher is doing or the
[42:54] musicians have to do or have a fancy
[42:57] choir or fancy church or whatever it
[43:00] just takes a people that know how to
[43:02] pull on the gift and I believe that you
[43:05] are a people of such um that do that and

[44:06] message is the way out of here we're not
[44:09] as brother Wayne said we're not uh
[44:11] glorifying the man of William brandom
[44:14] amen but we got our eyes just a little
[44:16] higher we we recognize the God that was
[44:19] had his picture taken with that prophet
[44:22] and as I've said before you know God
[44:24] could have just had his picture
[44:26] taken and um all we would have had was
[44:29] just a picture of the pillar of fire and
[44:32] that would have been wonderful but it
[44:34] would still left us in
[44:36] confusion amen but God had his picture
[44:38] taken with brother
[44:40] brandom that gives us sends us a
[44:43] message that I back up what he says what
[44:47] he preaches I back up so you can listen
[44:50] to the tapes because God backs it up and
[44:53] if God can back it up I can back it up
[44:55] can you say Amen if God says Amen to it
[44:59] then I can say Amen to it amen so I'm
[45:02] I'm just honored to be part of this you

[45:12] and just hearing the stories of what
[45:14] happened in moses' time in the pillar of
[45:16] fire and we wouldn't have even got to
[45:18] hear the voice wouldn't have got to see
[45:20] these things but amen we've got the
[45:22] voice of a prophet on tape we can hear
[45:25] it play in our car our home and and the
[45:28] ministers as ministers get to study
[45:31] these things and but not only that we
[45:33] have a picture of a pillar of fire that
[45:36] God has Vindicated a message thoroughly
[45:38] can you say Amen aren't you glad for
[45:40] that you following a message that's been
[45:43] Vindicated I'm so glad for that and so

[45:49] that um of uh that don't feel like he
[45:52] needs his own sermon or his own come up
[45:55] with some own his own thought amen but
[45:58] I've heard him preach many times and uh
[46:01] been friends with him and and uh he just
[46:04] yields himself to the Lord and let the
[46:06] Lord just flow through him and he
[46:09] believes this message with all of his
[46:11] heart and so I know you're in for a real

[51:21] able to be here uh in the support of the
[51:24] meeting but amen we we certainly are
[51:26] honored to be here tonight amen if You'
[51:28] take your Bibles I'd like to turn to two
[51:31] places in the scripture in the both in
[51:34] the Book of Matthew I'd like to read
[51:36] from Matthew Chapter
[51:38] 5 um just one verse there and then also
[51:41] one verse out of Matthew chapter
[51:48] 4 if I get to coffin having a coffin fit
[51:53] don't be worried about it I um I'm
[51:56] trying I've been uh getting over uh uh I
[51:59] had the flu a while back and some of
[52:02] them symptoms are lingering and they're
[52:04] trying to hold on but Satan is a
[52:08] liar amen so uh amen all the symptoms we
[52:12] just call them lme vanities tonight amen
[52:15] but we just uh ask God for his grace
[52:17] Matthew Chapter 5 and I want to read one
[52:19] verse there verse 6 and then also one
[52:22] verse from Matthew chapter 4 let's read
[52:26] from Matthew 5 and 6 and the Bible says
[52:28] blessed are they which do hunger and
[52:31] thirst after righteousness for they
[52:34] shall be
[52:36] filled amen how many's thankful for that
[52:38] promise
[52:39] tonight amen so if you have a hunger and
[52:42] a thirst for right you shall be filled
[52:46] amen Matthew 4 and uh just one verse
[52:49] there Matthew 4 and:
[52:52] 4 but he answered and said it is is
[52:55] written man shall not live by bread
[52:58] alone but by every word that proceedeth
[53:02] out of the mouth of God Amen may the
[53:06] Lord just add His blessings as you're
[53:07] seated tonight I want to uh speak to you
[53:11] tonight just for a few minutes on the
[53:13] blessing of hunger and um I'm good to
[53:16] have brother Tim here tonight and
[53:19] brother Thomas and brother Colin there
[53:21] from the church and and uh so we
[53:23] appreciate them being here tonight but
[53:25] uh they're going to have to hear some
[53:27] things they've already heard amen but uh
[53:31] uh but God uh uh you know I I believe
[53:33] that uh somebody said one time that
[53:36] leftovers wasn't too bad if you got them
[53:38] hot enough so maybe we can get it good
[53:40] and hot amen amen but uh we just want to
[53:44] look at this tonight the blessing of
[53:46] hunger amen and and you can see here
[53:49] that Jesus is saying and and there in
[53:51] Matthew 5 as he's preaching there uh his
[53:54] great great sermon and uh and and he's
[53:57] placing a blessing upon the people he
[53:59] says blessed are the poor in spirit
[54:01] blessed amen are the meek and so forth
[54:03] and and there was all the blessings that
[54:05] he began to say that over the people
[54:08] amen but he he said blessed are they
[54:11] that hunger and thirst after
[54:14] righteousness amen so we can see that
[54:17] but the that right at the beginning of
[54:19] this this hunger and thirst that Jesus
[54:21] is speaking of is not a a natural hunger
[54:25] it's not a a hunger for bread or water
[54:28] uh it's not that the the natural hunger
[54:31] but he's talking about a spiritual
[54:33] hunger amen a a spiritual desire within
[54:36] the people amen so he said blessed are
[54:38] they which do hunger and thirst after
[54:40] right for they shall be filled and amen
[54:44] I love how the scripture is positive and
[54:46] amen the word of God is just positive it
[54:48] don't say that they might be filled but
[54:50] it says they shall be filled amen so
[54:53] amen we got a promise tonight that if we
[54:55] come
[54:56] hungry amen we're going to leave
[54:59] satisfied amen if we come thirsty then
[55:02] we're going to leave satisfied amen
[55:04] because the Bible says blessed are they
[55:07] that hunger and thirst amen for they
[55:09] shall be filled now amen we also know
[55:11] that the Bible predicts that there would
[55:13] be a famine in the land in the last days
[55:15] and amen The Book of Amos the 8th
[55:17] chapter there the Bible says that behold
[55:20] the days come sayith the Lord that I
[55:22] will send a famine in the land not a
[55:24] famine of bread not a thirst for water
[55:26] but the but hearing of the words of the
[55:29] Lord amen so the famine uh would be the
[55:33] famine for hearing the word of God Amen
[55:36] and brother Brandon would say it this
[55:37] way in the message the Seal of the
[55:39] Antichrist he said the churches are
[55:41] cooling off we might as well just face
[55:42] that the churches are getting worse all
[55:45] the time more preaching is being done
[55:47] than ever in the world and less practice
[55:50] than we ever did in all the world it
[55:52] just looks like it just keeps cooling
[55:54] off and great re revivals will strike
[55:56] the country men will come in anointed of
[55:58] the Holy Spirit they'll preach with
[56:00] everything that's within them and the
[56:02] people will just walk right away as if
[56:04] nothing ever happened see just
[56:06] unconcerned amen that's amen there's got
[56:08] to be a reason for that and if you'll
[56:10] study this then this will tell us what
[56:12] the reason is do you know the scripture
[56:15] says that there will be a time in the
[56:16] last days that there'll be a famine that
[56:18] will strike the land not for bread and
[56:20] water but for hearing of the word of God
[56:23] and that men would go to and fr and east
[56:25] and west seeking to hear the word of God
[56:27] and fail to find it just think of the
[56:29] times that we're living in and we're
[56:31] living in that time so now a prophet is
[56:34] not only showing us amen that it was
[56:36] prophesied in the in the scripture that
[56:38] there would come a time of famine amen
[56:41] but now a prophet is identifying we are
[56:43] actually living in that time amen we're
[56:46] living in the hour of the famine amen
[56:49] that was prophesied in Amos 811 amen
[56:51] that there would come a time amen that
[56:53] people would not amen hear the word of
[56:56] the Lord amen and Paul talks about it he
[56:58] said listen they'll not endure sound
[57:00] Doctrine but they'll heat to themselves
[57:02] teachers having itching ears is that
[57:04] right amen the time will come and listen
[57:07] friends we're living in that time now
[57:09] amen it's not amen a famine for bread
[57:11] and water brother said we got plenty of
[57:13] bread to eat and plenty of water to
[57:14] drink and we got houses to live in and
[57:17] amen and play and we got money in the
[57:19] bank and all these things amen but
[57:21] listen amen what is lacking and what is
[57:24] missing amen is a hearing of the word of
[57:27] God amen amen listen and and a famine
[57:31] will always bring a
[57:33] hunger amen famine amen because a famine
[57:37] is a lack of something see amen and
[57:40] famine is followed by starvation amen
[57:43] and hunger amen and brother B would say
[57:45] the Cry of hunger listen he said the cry
[57:48] the great cry it's a great cry because
[57:51] it's distressful SE and a person is
[57:53] dying he said if we could just get to
[57:55] that place if this nation could get to
[57:58] the place that is so hungered for God he
[58:01] said it's in a worse starvation than the
[58:04] Nations like India see they're starving
[58:07] physically amen but this nation is
[58:09] starving
[58:11] spiritually amen but after you are
[58:13] hungry for so long amen it gets to the
[58:17] place that you don't know you're
[58:19] hungry it's just like a man that's
[58:22] freezing to death he'll go so far see
[58:24] and when you get so cold and then and
[58:27] while you and then after a while the
[58:29] prophet said you begin to become warm
[58:31] and when you do you're dying then see
[58:34] amen and that's what's the matter
[58:35] tonight the church has got so cold until
[58:38] they're freezing amen and they think
[58:40] that they're warm they think they're
[58:41] warm by membership but they're dying
[58:44] spiritually amen see they don't even
[58:47] know it and finally they just lay down
[58:49] and go to sleep and that's all of it and
[58:51] they'll never wake up again amen because
[58:53] his blood is just Flo Frozen up right in
[58:55] his veins there and the prophet of God
[58:57] said that's the condition that the
[58:58] church is in in the last days it's
[59:00] spiritually dying amen it's spiritually
[59:03] starving amen but it's been hungry for
[59:06] so long amen until it don't even
[59:08] recognize amen the hunger amen or the
[59:11] starvation amen or the condition that
[59:14] it's got so cold amen until a spiritual
[59:17] condition amen it struck the church
[59:19] until it's got so cold that it's fell
[59:22] into a state amen that it believes that
[59:24] it
[59:26] warm amen and the prophet of God said
[59:28] amen they're they're they're in this
[59:30] condition see spiritually dying on the
[59:33] church

[59:41] famine in the land and it's a famine of
[59:44] the hearing of the word of God Amen but

[1:00:45] amen that little boy's
[1:00:47] lunch amen and he took and he as he
[1:00:49] broke that bread amen amen he was
[1:00:52] multiplying the bread and as he broke
[1:00:55] that bread he handed it to his disciples
[1:00:58] and they in turn handed it to the people
[1:01:02] come on friends they didn't cook
[1:01:04] it they didn't season it amen they

[1:05:53] up he said they pressed on him to hear
[1:05:55] the word it shows that they were
[1:05:58] hungry see you can't interest people for
[1:06:01] food until they get hungry but when they
[1:06:04] get hungry then they can really talk
[1:06:06] about food and that's the way it is amen
[1:06:09] if you're if you're not interested in
[1:06:11] God you can't talk god to the people but

[1:10:13] Amen brother bam amen picks that up and
[1:10:14] he said if there's a deep calling
[1:10:16] there's got to be a deep to
[1:10:20] respond amen and brother bam would make
[1:10:23] it uh just gives such a a beautiful
[1:10:25] example of it he talks about a little
[1:10:26] boy amen is eating erasers off the
[1:10:29] pencils and amen his mother sent him out
[1:10:31] there chewing on a bicycle pedal and and
[1:10:33] they thought there's something bad wrong
[1:10:35] with this child and they took him down
[1:10:36] to the doctor and they examined the boy

[1:10:55] that and brother Brown said if there was
[1:10:56] something in him that was calling for it
[1:10:58] there had to be something out
[1:11:01] there Amen to answer that to fulfill
[1:11:05] that to satisfy that desire and the

[1:18:12] you Matthew chapter
[1:18:15] 12 the Bible

[1:18:20] Sabbath day through the corn and it is
[1:18:23] disciples were
[1:18:26] hungered and they begin to pluck the
[1:18:28] ears of corn and
[1:18:30] eat but when the Pharisees saw it they
[1:18:32] said unto him Behold thy disciples do
[1:18:36] that which is not lawful to do upon the
[1:18:38] Sabbath
[1:18:39] day but he said unto
[1:18:43] them have you not read what David
[1:18:46] did when he was
[1:18:49] hungered and they that were with him how
[1:18:53] he entered into the house of God and did
[1:18:55] eat the
[1:18:56] showbread which was not lawful for him
[1:18:59] to eat neither for them that were with
[1:19:01] him but it was only for the priest amen
[1:19:05] watch amen it was it was the disciples
[1:19:08] hunger that caused them to pluck the
[1:19:10] corn and eat it on the Sabbath and them
[1:19:13] Pharisees standing by begin to criticize
[1:19:15] them and say Amen how dare they eat the
[1:19:17] corn on the Sabbath day even brother
[1:19:19] bham talks about it he said a Jewish man
[1:19:21] come to him and said amen I proed to you
[1:19:23] by the scripture that Jesus was a thief

[1:19:29] he said cuz he was eating corn on the
[1:19:31] Sabbath day amen and Jesus amen Amen
[1:19:36] brother Bown said what you don't
[1:19:38] understand is he's the lord of the
[1:19:43] Harvest amen this man was trying to amen
[1:19:45] bring an accusation that they were
[1:19:47] taking something that didn't belong to
[1:19:49] them amen but brother Bram gives an
[1:19:51] answer and said listen It All Belongs to
[1:19:53] him he's the lord of the
[1:19:56] Harvest amen but really and truly the
[1:19:59] real problem they had was that they were
[1:20:01] eating a corn on the Sabbath day amen
[1:20:03] but brother Brown watch cuz brother
[1:20:05] Brown also tells him he said look even
[1:20:07] in your own laws amen if a man was
[1:20:09] hungry he could go into a
[1:20:12] field amen it didn't have to be his
[1:20:15] field he could go in his neighbor's
[1:20:17] field and he could eat until his soul
[1:20:20] was until he was satisfied he couldn't
[1:20:23] gather amen the man's Harvest amen and
[1:20:26] take it home with him but if he was
[1:20:28] hungry and he was walking through a
[1:20:30] field amen he could take from that field
[1:20:33] until he was
[1:20:34] satisfied right Hallelujah and Jesus
[1:20:38] looks at them Pharisees and said didn't
[1:20:40] you read in the scripture amen where
[1:20:42] David because he got hungry one day he
[1:20:45] went down to the to the house of God and
[1:20:47] David said have you got any bread and
[1:20:50] they said we ain't got no common bread
[1:20:52] amen we ain't got no bread that you can
[1:20:54] eat amen but David said listen friends
[1:20:57] amen that should have been enough amen
[1:21:00] and in any other day any other time amen
[1:21:02] David would asked that question they
[1:21:04] said listen we ain't got no common bread
[1:21:06] amen we ain't got nothing amen for you
[1:21:09] amen David would just moved on but the
[1:21:13] hunger that was in his
[1:21:16] heart amen caused him to press the
[1:21:19] matter amen and he would not leave amen
[1:21:23] he said ain't you got some bread and
[1:21:25] they said well the bread we

[1:39:24] right let me try to bring this down to a
[1:39:28] close
[1:39:30] tonight I want to show you another
[1:39:35] hunger Mark
[1:39:39] 11 in verse 12 the Bible says and on the
[1:39:44] mar when they were come from
[1:39:46] Bethany he was
[1:39:49] hungry he speaking of the Lord
[1:39:52] now he's
[1:39:55] hungry and see in a fig tree a far off
[1:39:58] having
[1:39:59] leaves he came if happily he might find
[1:40:02] anything there on and when he came to it
[1:40:06] he found nothing but leaves for the time
[1:40:09] of figs was not
[1:40:11] yet and Jesus answered and said unto it
[1:40:13] no man eat of the fruit of thee
[1:40:15] Hereafter
[1:40:16] forever and his disciples heard
[1:40:19] it listen
[1:40:21] I think this is amazing because and I
[1:40:23] don't want to spend a lot of time right
[1:40:24] here but I do want to just stop and say
[1:40:26] this Jesus now is coming to this tree
[1:40:30] because he's
[1:40:31] hungry and when he comes to this
[1:40:34] tree and and and we'll get into it a
[1:40:37] little bit more but you know a lot of
[1:40:39] times a lot of times we we justify the
[1:40:42] tree even brother Brandon would say you
[1:40:45] can't blame the tree cuz it wasn't the
[1:40:47] time see Amen in one place he would say
[1:40:51] that way can't blame because the Bible
[1:40:53] says it wasn't the time of fix you see
[1:40:56] so but but it's always I've always
[1:40:58] pondered that I've always wondered why
[1:41:00] would Jesus curse a tree for having no
[1:41:03] fruit right right when it wasn't the
[1:41:06] time but see his hunger had moved him
[1:41:10] yeah and he had saw the leaves of the
[1:41:12] tree and he saw the tree in its beauty
[1:41:16] and amen and there was life in the tree
[1:41:19] and and and and and because of the
[1:41:21] hunger that he had it moved him to the
[1:41:23] tree he was and he went there even
[1:41:26] hoping to find fruit that would satisfy
[1:41:30] amen the desire the hunger that he had
[1:41:33] and when he come to the tree amen
[1:41:35] finding no fruit the Bible said he
[1:41:37] cursed the tree he said no man eat of
[1:41:40] thee forever amen what and he cursed
[1:41:42] that tree and watch what brother Bram
[1:41:44] would even take that when Jesus cursed
[1:41:46] the tree amen and and the prophet of God
[1:41:48] said notice he cursed it from the roof
[1:41:52] Roots amen and one place that he said it
[1:41:55] this way he said he put his faith
[1:41:58] against the
[1:42:00] life that was in that
[1:42:03] tree listen I want to tell you something
[1:42:05] when Jesus cursed that tree nothing
[1:42:08] changed Jesus cursed the tree the leaves
[1:42:10] didn't immediately fall off the
[1:42:13] tree come on the tree
[1:42:15] didn't just instantly amen fall over but
[1:42:21] it was
[1:42:23] dead the very minute that Jesus spoke to
[1:42:26] that tree it was dead amen because he
[1:42:29] cursed it from The
[1:42:31] Roots listen friends I want to tell you
[1:42:34] this is the difference between the power
[1:42:36] of God and the power of Satan because
[1:42:38] Satan was trying to destroy amen the the
[1:42:41] the the tree amen and brother BR would
[1:42:44] talk about the type Christ as the tree
[1:42:47] Amen in the restoration of the Bride
[1:42:48] tree and notice amen what was it he
[1:42:50] began to eat on the tree and he began to
[1:42:53] strip it from the fruits and then the
[1:42:55] leaves and then the bark and he began to
[1:42:57] gnaw it down and eat it down amen but
[1:43:00] listen friends he could never get to the
[1:43:03] life because the life was in The
[1:43:06] Roots Hallelujah and therefore no matter
[1:43:10] what Satan did to the tree there was
[1:43:12] always a promise of
[1:43:16] restoration Hallelujah he said he G
[1:43:19] Christ down until the was nothing but a
[1:43:21] stop he said but there was life in the
[1:43:24] roots and a promise in God's word I will
[1:43:28] restore sayith the
[1:43:30] Lord hallelujah hallelujah but when
[1:43:34] Jesus got ready to curse the tree amen
[1:43:37] he didn't start on the outside and and
[1:43:39] heated down to the inside he cursed The
[1:43:44] Roots he cursed the
[1:43:47] life watch what brother Ram said he said
[1:43:51] even the tree there he said all the
[1:43:54] saints in the world couldn't make one
[1:43:56] blade of grass do you know that they
[1:43:59] couldn't something looks like it see
[1:44:01] they can't find the formul formula of
[1:44:03] life that's God Jesus said to the tree
[1:44:06] curse be you you don't have any fruit
[1:44:09] and you'll never have any and they
[1:44:12] passed by there it was about 8:00 in the
[1:44:14] morning passed by amen as they were
[1:44:17] going later that dinner that day the
[1:44:19] prophet said as they were going to
[1:44:21] dinner Peter looked at the tree and said
[1:44:24] it's dead from The Roots up he said wow
[1:44:27] Jesus rebuked the life that was in The
[1:44:31] Roots and the whole thing
[1:44:34] died and then the prophet said
[1:44:37] Hallelujah that same Christ can re
[1:44:40] rebuke a cancer from the roots and the
[1:44:44] whole thing will die see the tree was
[1:44:47] standing there just the same as it was
[1:44:49] hours before but you couldn't find amen
[1:44:51] listen amen but you find out the leash
[1:44:53] begin to drop off amen and then you see
[1:44:55] the bark begin to peel off and wear away
[1:44:58] and day after day and week after week
[1:45:01] and after a while there wasn't one Speck
[1:45:02] of that tree left Hallelujah cancer
[1:45:04] tumors cataracts anything else will have
[1:45:07] to go when Christ
[1:45:09] speaks hallelujah amen cancers cataracts
[1:45:12] anything sickness amen I don't care what
[1:45:14] it is tonight when Christ
[1:45:16] [Music]
[1:45:17] speaks because he is not dealing with
[1:45:20] the
[1:45:22] symptoms he's dealing with the root of
[1:45:25] the
[1:45:27] problem come on friends I tell you
[1:45:29] that's the problem that we got amen a
[1:45:31] lot of times in the church all we do is
[1:45:34] try to fix the symptoms and amen we try
[1:45:36] to fix it over here and fix it over
[1:45:38] there what we need is a move of God we
[1:45:40] need the Holy Spirit to drop down amen
[1:45:43] and get to the root of the thing and get
[1:45:46] the life out of
[1:45:47] [Applause]
[1:45:49] it
[1:45:52] sir I'm telling you I've seen it so many
[1:45:55] times am mean you can you can have

[1:46:07] yeah and one
[1:46:09] service the presence of God drop
[1:46:12] in and the Holy Spirit begins to
[1:46:15] [Music]
[1:46:16] move and God will begin to
[1:46:19] speak
[1:46:21] and he'll go right down to the
[1:46:24] root where the thing was hidden
[1:46:27] at and curse it from the
[1:46:30] root and then we all stand back and
[1:46:32] we're amazed how quickly the tree doth
[1:46:36] wither listen how quickly the problem
[1:46:38] does leave amen how quickly does the
[1:46:41] thing get turned around amen why because
[1:46:43] God has
[1:46:46] spoke

[1:47:19] temple begin to cast them out that sold
[1:47:21] and bought in the temple over through
[1:47:23] the tables of the money Chambers the
[1:47:25] seed of them that sold does and would
[1:47:27] not suffer that any man should carry any
[1:47:29] vessel through the temple and he taught
[1:47:31] saying unto them it is is it not written
[1:47:34] that my house shall be called of all
[1:47:35] Nations a House of
[1:47:37] Prayer but you've made it a dent of
[1:47:39] Thieves amen and the scribes and the
[1:47:41] chief priests heard it and they sought
[1:47:44] how that they might destroy him for they
[1:47:45] feared him because all the people was
[1:47:47] astonished at his Doctrine amen and when
[1:47:50] he evening was come they went out of of
[1:47:52] the city and in the morning as they
[1:47:54] passed by they saw the fig tree dried up
[1:47:57] from the roots and Peter calling to
