and sister Alice amen and uh we certainly appreciate them and um so they they may not be here Wednesday night going on a trip or so so we wanted to say happy anniversary amen sure love you guys very much amen and um St John I uh I forgot my glasses this morning and tonight so um we're going to try here but um we're going to start at the first verse these words spake Jesus and lifted up his eyes to heaven and said father the hour is come glorify thy son that thy son May glorify thee as thou Hast given him Power Over All Flesh that he should give eternal life to as many as thou Hast given him and this is life eternal that they might Know Thee the only true God in Jesus Christ whom thou has sent I have glorified thee on the earth I have finished the work which thou gavest me to do and now oh Father glorify thou me with thine own self with the glory which I had with thee before the world was I have manifested thy name unto the men which thou gavest me but of the world uh thine they were and thou gavest them me and they have kept Thy word now they have known that all things whatsoever thou Hast given me are of thee for I have given unto them The Words which thou gavest me and they have receive them and have known surely that I came out from thee and they have believed that thou did send me I pray for them I pray not for the world but for them which thou Hast given me for they are thine and all mine are thine and all thine are mine and am glorified in them and now I am no more in the world but these are in the world and I come to thee Holy Father keep through thine own name those which thou Hast given me that they may be one and as we are amen let's just bow our heads in a word of prayer father what a profound prayer that Jesus would pray not just for those that was with him in the natural the 12 but Lord he was praying all the way down to this age Hallelujah father all that elect Lord and that is our prayer father that we would be one even as you and he was one now father may you grant it may may you be with us tonight give us the words to say father anoint both speaker and hearer thank you for being with us this morning Lord and pray that you would just feel at home tonight in Jesus Christ's name and the church says amen amen amen you can have your seats this evening praise the Lord and um I guess the title that I would use is the Oneness of God in the body of Christ you know we are we are fixing to step into eternity and this is something that uh the prophet said that you know that why we're in the greatest age ever to be and that's because we are are stepping into from from uh time into uh eternity mortality immortality and church this is this is about to happen this is about to take place and how how exciting that we should be and and every time that we come to the house of God every time we we play a message and and things you know uh uh we we come and we do these things to know how we should live and how we should think and how we should talk and the way we should conduct ourselves and because we're we're we're preparing for eternity we we're preparing again we we thank the Lord for filling us with the baptism of the Holy Ghost and and sealing us into the body but uh uh but yet there there is a preparation it's a continual molding and conform forming and and and these things and and so what what Jesus prayed I I truly believe that in this age it's when it's actually coming to its reality and we are that people uh you know it's amazing how a prayer can be prophetic but it was prophetic um because Jesus knew what would take place and he knew a certain group of people and who knew who that people would be and and you know we we you know that song that we sing sometimes when he was on the cross I was on his mind I I believe that prayer I was on his mind when he was praying that prayer and and I I think I think we were um because God was praying for a Oneness uh here and it it seems like uh everyone uh is is is trying for a uh to bring a Oneness they uh in in in some way or another and and that's because man was made for Oneness he he was made for that and and so but when Jesus is praying he says I I pray not for the world uh but he was praying for that elect for he says I pray for those that thou Hast given me and and and and he wasn't satisfied with just any kind of Oneness but it was a a certain Oneness and that Oneness was the same kind of Oneness that he and the father had ain't that right now this kind of Oneness cannot exist uh H apart from being in the body of of of Christ it uh a person must be baptized into the body to have or to be a part of of this Oneness can you say amen amen and so we we cannot be the church uh uh uh and and and and not have the Oneness that Jesus was praying for so we're we're glad to be in the church we're glad to be baptized uh by spiritual baptism into the body of Christ as we've been uh uh speaking of Amen but but in this this is where the Oneness is going to take place this is where the Oneness is happening is in the body of Christ do you believe that and and so the the prophet says see we've got to have a church that's washed in the blood of the lamb and become one with the word see to be the church see so so the Church of the Living God Amen there's got to be a Oneness but that Oneness is one with the word ain't that right no wonder the word of God is so important to us over anything over our feelings over emotions over over over any circumstance of of any anything the word of God means everything to us and so uh John 847 Jesus said he that is of God heareth God's words ye therefore hear them not because you're not of God so he puts the distinction that he that is of god heareth the words of God he that is not of God heareth not the words of God and as as we've been saying all along that that that Miracles can happen anywhere uh uh gifts can be operated in the body outside the body anointed and and and and all of these things but the distinction is he that is of god heareth the words of God and he that is not of God heareth them not ain't that right so so uh uh brother brandom in in talking of of Jesus's day and and the people the Pharisees Sadducees and things he said they had refused the word see they had refused the word uh uh Jesus and his words for their day but the true seed everybody say the true seed the true seed received the word because they were of God ain't that right so now in in the the the church ages um uh God addresses each Church Age and and every Church age what does he say at the end he that hath an ear to hear Let Him hear what the spirit says to the church a lot of things took place in the church ages in each age but at the end he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith to the church well why is that because the spirit gives the word and the word is the truth ain't that right so he that has Truth for each Age and and see then then or God has truth the prophet said for each age and his elect hears the truth amen for for that age ain't that right see so uh brother Brown would say the that that elect group always heard the word down Through the Ages that elect group it could have been a small group but that elect group always heard the word and received it proving they had the seed within them ain't that right the prophet Isaiah in 54:13 said all thy children shall be taught of God the holy spirit all thy children shall be taught of God John 6:45 it is written in the prophets that they shall and they shall be all taught of God every man therefore that hath heard and that hath learned or hath learned of the father cometh unto me so he puts the distinction as of of who the is they are those that hear the word of God receive the word of God and and because they have that ability to do so they come unto him ain't that right see God pulls us through his word he pulls us through his truth ain't that right amen we we have a lot of things and and and you say well I I thought first second third you know first pull was the the the attraction and that's true amen but what kept you what what kept you when everybody else left it during that third pool when it was the third pool the opening of the word many people forsook many people left but there was that certain group that stayed and and as Jesus told them and and actually you know uh when the 70 walked away and said this is a hard saying what was he doing he was actually opening the word to them it was his third pull Ministry ain't that right and then he turns around to his disciples and says will you go also he didn't beg him he didn't plead he didn't he said well you know I'll give you a large pizza if you'll just stay with me you know it wasn't that at all he actually said would you go also and and and Peter I believe it was that said where can we go for thou Hast the words of eternal life so so it it it it it it boils down of of being one with the word proves whether you are of God and spirit filled ain't that right now gifts are manifestation of the spirit and we thank God for gifts I believe in gifts speaking in tongues and interpretation of tongues healing and miracles and prophecies and and and all the other gifts that Paul uh the Apostle Paul mentioned in in the New Testament and and these things they they manifestation of the spirit but notice 1 Corinthians 12:7 but the manifestation of the spirit is given to every man right can you say that with me every man it's given to every man to profit with all ain't that right so so the manifestation of the spirit is different from having the baptism of the Holy Ghost ain't that right it's different at least that's what the prophet taught amen see so balam had a genuine gift and was genuinely anointed but he was not according to the prophet of the of the of of the power said he was not a true seed Prophet amen because even though he had a gift and even though he was anointed yet he uh uh wasn't anointed to the word of God Amen brother Ram says for he took the wages of unrighteousness and worst of all he led the people of God into sins of fornication and idolatry yet who would dare to deny that the spirit of God manifested through him in one of the most beautiful portions of absolute absolutely accurate prophecy the world has ever seen but he never had the Holy Ghost can you say Amen so as we said this morning his teaching his uh uh prophecy was right but his teaching was wrong so brother Bram said see if you are truly filled with the spirit of God you will have the evidence everybody say the evidence of the word in your life can you say Amen now you we talking about a oness now if you're truly Spirit-filled you'll have the evidence of the word in your life so look you know looking at the word and and there's so many things because I believe that every type and shatter speaking of the Bride speaks of us today e every Everything of scriptures you know uh as as the word come to its fullness in Jesus's day so has the word come in its fullness in this bright coming of Christ as well ain't that right so so the word talks about uh talks about true worship and and according to what Jesus said in John 4:24 they that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in truth can you say Amen so for those that don't believe in worship for those that that think that well they're they're Pentecostal because they shout and they get excited and and all of these things well if we're truly one with with the word and have that Oneness that Jesus was talking about we can find that worship for this age is in the Bible for Revelations 5 talks about it can you say Amen see it was after the lamb took the book and loosened the seals thereof amen there was worship amen can you say Amen there was worship amen see now I've I've been in the Pentecostal era I know what it is when when they got the music going and and and and and and working the crowd up there is not one time that I have seen in in in in uh uh uh well in in this church in our meetings or or around to where that people are worked up by by music it's by the word of God Amen and after the preaching of the word there ought to be a worship going forth can you say amen amen see so so now now brother brandham identified this this type of worship as king lamb worship so worship of the Bride there's nothing wrong with worship can you sayen it it it's what's causing the worship see so the word speaks of signs and wonders following the believer the word speaks of the fivefold ministry which are five predestinated gifts that God placed in in the church in his church his body the word speaks of nine spiritual gifts that God has placed in the church the word speaks of this bride doing the Greater Works the word speaks of of the manifestation of the sons of God and every one of them is is of these things is to happen in this age can you say amen that's right I don't believe that God restored the gifts Amen in in the Pentecostal age only to take them out Amen in this age I don't believe that God took justification amen restored that part in Luther's age only to take it out in this age I don't believe that uh uh uh uh uh that God would restore holiness amen and and and uh uh sanctification in in Wesley's age only to take it out in this age here can you say amen amen but as he's restored it he's been bringing a body into completeness yes sir and you say Amen now as we talked about it they didn't know what they had sure ain't that right but when God sent us a prophet he placed Us positionally in the word of God and now we're maturing understanding what these things are I believe we have a greater revelation of justification than what Luther had I believe we have a greater revelation of of sanctification than what Wesley had I believe we have a greater revelation of the gifts than what Pentecost had right can you say amen amen see so so we we're we're looking at these time brother Bram said there's never been a time for the sons of God to be manifested outside of this time he said tell me brother tell me my brother tell me my sister when has this ever been outside of this age can you say man see so we we find even the Supernatural is in the word it talks about we we are a supernatural people do you believe that see the word prophet prophesies of a bride having Authority in the word when she speaks do you realize that is is is for us today amen Jesus said if you say to this mountain be thou removed and and don't doubt you can have what you say these things are for today can you say Amen see so so we we find it's in this day that the prophet said the word is in the bride and she has thus sayith the Lord she has the sayith the Lord can you say Amen see so it's now we are coming into a Oneness the way Jesus had come and the Oneness existed between God and him uh brother brandom I I read this this morning but I'll read it again make no mistake about it a person that is truly baptized by the Holy Ghost into the body of Christ receiving the fullness of the spirit will be in the word all the way and that is the evidence of being baptized with the Holy Ghost all right now we talked about it how that Eve couldn't wait talked about this morning how that God told them to to to multiply and replenish the Earth but Eve couldn't wait and so when when Adam came to her he found that she was already uh pregnated with the wrong seed instead of the word seed ain't that right so the prophet said she never did Bear a the life seed a life child because she disbelieved she rejected the word and Adam her husband found her to be a prostitute because she she received seed out out other than the way she was supposed to ain't that right and so well then brother Bram goes and talks about how Jehovah's bride done the same thing amen she was put away he put her away uh uh Bill wrote her a bill of divorcement uh because she disbelieved and and brother Bram says this is here it was in in Sam 1st Samuel 8:7 the Lord said unto Samuel remember they wanted a king you know God sent them a prophet a word Prophet but they wanted a king they wanted to be like the other nations and and and so forth and and Samuel came to the Lord crying and and and saying you know they've rejected me you know and and you could have must have felt what it what he was feeling in as feeling rejected from the people but the Lord said unto Samuel go ahead and hearken unto the voice of the people in all that they say unto thee for they have not rejected thee but they have rejected me that I should not Reign Over them can you say Amen here Samuel a prophet thought that the people was literally rejecting him and God says oh no they're not rejecting you they're literally rejecting me because the word comes to a prophet right that's right anytime someone rejects a prophet but you're rejecting God true and so the prophet said see that she wanted to go whing around after the rest of the people see she couldn't wait therefore she rejected the word and she went after uh and and was found pregnated with the wrong seed he goes on and talks how Jesus's bride done the same thing uh uh you know that that uh uh she she couldn't wait uh uh and and before you know it she was found in impregnated with the wrong seed and notice what the prophet said they have to manufacture something they can't wait for the Holy Spirit to come and get into the church can you say amen amen this is the problem with with down Through the Ages they could not wait for the Holy Ghost to come and get into the church they had to have something they had to manufacture something can you say Amen see so so he says all they're all all polluted their husband couldn't get to them they was already pregnated for their husband got to them can you say Amen see and what made them that way he says they rejected the word and took a denomination so Methodist Traditions have rejected the word Baptist Traditions have rejected the word uh um uh uh Seventh Day Adventist have rejected the word Jehovah's Witness have rejected the word Pentecostals have rejected the word you cannot find a a religion a denomination that has accepted the word they all turning down yes can you say Amen so so this this Oneness that Jesus is praying for you ain't going to find it in the Baptist Church you're not going to find it in a Pentecostal Church you're not going to find it in the apostolic church right ain't that right but God that prayer must come to pass amen Jesus ain't praying for to be in vain and to think of it he's praying for you hallelujah it's not just a preacher praying for you God God in flesh is praying for you make him one Lord hallelujah no telling he no no telling he probably saw the deception of the devil coming through these ages and and he knew he knew no doubt that that that in this age it would get so close that to deceive the elect and and and I I I maybe maybe he as he's he's seeing these things I don't know but but maybe there was just something down in his heart said oh God be merciful make him one prayer Works can you say Amen prayer Works see and and and so so every Church down Through the Ages he would give them a Revival and and they would reject it and accepting an organization accepting tradition accepting man's ideas and and even even Jesus said by teaching for Doctrine the Commandments of men they have made the word of God of no effect amen amen couldn't have a Rapture in Luther's age couldn't have a Rapture in Wesley's age couldn't have a Rapture in in any other age it there was no Oneness there good brother y can you say amen amen amen they made the word of God of none effect and the prophet said they cannot bring forth a word birth you cannot bring it ain't that right he said the church that will refuse and I want you to listen now the church that will refuse to believe the word of God is a hybrid church with dogmas Creeds doctrines that's not scriptural everything they're teaching is not scriptural right amen he said that church that church cannot bring forth a spirit fi child because it's hybrid it's no good it it might be bigger great big walls find pews big bails plush seets but that doesn't mean one thing it's spiritually dead amen yeah he said see it cannot bring for spirit filled children because it's dead itself now brother brandom in The Invisible Union of the Bride you you know I he talks about you know in comparing about women of today uh uh with with the the the modern church and you know how how they they refuse to to bring forth a child for their husband and and and and so forth and and so he says if they don't bring forth a child for their husband then they're going to mother a cat or a dog and that's happening uh and they they'll pay they'll pay a lot of money for them things amen and and not only that then they have their birthday party I know a couple that's had uh man had had birthday party for the dogs you know and and it really gets out there I'm telling you and I think the dogs live live a little bit more better than some children to but but brother brand said see to Bear a child for a husband see and raise it to the service of God that's entirely out of her line oh she'd be disgraced if she did by her sin loving Society of this 1965 type women and now it's worse in this age he said see it's a true picture of a modern church today neither does the modern Church want any of these here screaming shouting tongue speaking acts 238 youngans around her she she don't want any of them hooping and crying and screaming amen hallelujah see why such a child would put her immediately out of her denomination see if they had one of them in their churches they' throw her out right quick see why are you letting that stuff does this go along see so she's pregnated with something cuz she's bringing forth members all the time but she does not want any of them see screaming hollering blabbing uh uh acts 238 miserable creatures that she thinks they are see it would certainly embarrass her ain't that right it would ruin her and her educator ethical scientific Society Church that she belong he boy he covered it all right he says that they would throw her out at the next Council she can't have it so she does not want to be pregnated with the word because that's the only kind that the word can bring forth can you say Amen see born of the spirit of God it has the spirit of God in it see if you're born of the uh of the spirit of God you have the spirit of God see no intellectual Church joining Creed goinging robbed hair painted face there's no such a thing in that as in in that at all you don't find that in the word you find it oh Fashion Sanctified Holy Ghost filled child born of the spirit of God screaming hollering shouting and praising God why it's in the word and what has happened you received not a denominational birth but a word birth ain't that right see so so then you you know uh uh it was right after the fall of of woman a man that that God promised the woman that she would receive a seed and and Genesis 3:15 I didn't give that to you but and I will put enity you know uh between thee God speaking to to that serpent I'll put enity between thee and the woman and between thy seed and her seed right now I I I don't know but I I believe that that that scripture became more clearer to us under the message of the hour right and it shall bruise thy head and and thou shalt bruise his heel and brother brand said see her seed a woman don't have seed it's the man's seed but he was showing right there that it would be a virgin that would receive seed not by man but God would give her seed God would create the seed can you say man's seed it wouldn't be man SE seed see Adam had come to his natural wife amen but she had already had seed ain't that right she should have received the word seed but she was already impregnated but God said there will be a woman that will have a seed and it won't be by man God promising a a virgin can you say man well then years later here come the prophet Isaiah and God promises very clearly Behold a virgin shall conceive and have bring forth a a son ain't that right so before she could be pregnated with a sex seed the Holy Ghost would come to her and give her a seed amen and bring forth the Son of God Amen ain't that right yes sir oh aren't you glad for that well God promised it again he's promised that his church he would have a bride that before that before man would get to her yes and plant his seed in her denominations teachings of man doctrines of theology all these things God would get to her and give her a seed amen can you say Amen now now church here you know the you know the prophet said that she will not be manhandled right this bride in this age ain't going to be manhandled she's not going to be United with denominations and Creeds of man if that ain't the union that's going to happen this is the union between him and her Lord God and her ain't that right now brother Brown says now it's sea time it's bright time God going to show who his bride really is can you say man he's showing her off in this age amen aren't you glad for that church if you could only know you know job God was bragging on job all that time on the reason why job was going through all that God was bragging on him God was telling Satan you'll never be able to touch him you'll never be able to get him to quit and recant and give up and curse me you'll never be able to do it and so he said in this age there will be a bride that will not accept your your dogma and your theology and your nonsense he's tried it but she ain't going to be manhandled this is the time for a Oneness brother Brian said the Chucks are dead they're dried up it's virgin word time not touched it's a virgin remember a virgin word time if you put it in the hands of a denomination it sure wouldn't be a virgin that's right it'll be manhandled time you get uh uh get to it but God's church is not touched by denomination aren't you glad for that you we might have been steeped into it you thought this was it but God was able to take you bring you in this message bring you out now you ain't got a you ain't got a touch of denomination on you all right think of that Hallelujah you know how many times that people have been manhandled by denominations and they couldn't believe this Prophet they they they can't believe the Prophet come on now because their pastor says it's it's of the devil and and the bishop says it's of this and you know thinking of the Catholic woman I remember a man wanting to give uh a Rel of of his Bible and and and and she's she was strict Catholic and but he bought her a Bible and gave it to her you know what she she took that to her priest amen and the priest told her you leave that alone that ain't for you wow now you think of that she was manhandled where she would take that Bible and put it away and take what her priest said but aren't you glad you ain't been manhandled amen no matter where you come from and what what what things you went through and all of these things you still are able to believe God's word and throw everything else and tell Satan you're a liar I will not trust you I will not take your word for it I'll take God's word every anytime over your word amen why cuz God's church is not touched by denomination it's a virgin born word of God made manifest Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever amen he said there will be no denominational manhandling in the Virgin birth of the Bride she is commanded by God to come out of such ain't that right well do you love the Lord yes sir see and so we we find uh uh that that the the uh uh uh what happened on the day of Pentecost amen it was it was a word birth amen for they had experienced the thing that they had experienced was not a denomination it wasn't some some thing that that happened of man it wasn't something out of the Bible but what they had experienced was spoken already by a prophet Joel ain't that right and and even the people all around was wondering what is this what what's going on who what you know these men are drunk and it was Peter that could identify what was happening by the word of God and he said but these men aren't drunk as you suppose but this is that which was spoken by the prophet Joel can you say man I I to tell you there's so many things that are happening in churches today around the world that they cannot put and say this is that which was spoken by this Bible amen but there is a bride that can take every part of her life every action every thought every word amen and they're coming back and say but this is that this day this scripture is fulfilled it's a bride revival can you sayen it's a bride Revival and that was the beginning of the Church of the Living God God Amen and and now you think of it in the Old Testament the prophet said see the spirit of God worked down through the prophets till it come to the full manifestation in Christ Jesus amen it worked all the way through the prophets amen the spirit of God in each prophet in each age amen till it come into full manifestation of Jesus Christ amen and he says the birth pains under the those prophets see them being the word see they pointed to knew that fullness of themselves see they knew it was more than just them it was Christ in them but they would Point not to this but they would point to the fullness the fullness can you say Amen kept pointing to people someday it's coming and Jesus came and said I am he I'm he I'm he can you say man this is that which was spoken by this is that this day this scripture is fulfilled everything that they spoke I am the true bread I am am the bread of life I am the living Fountain can you say man all of these things see they pointed to that to that fullness of themselves which was the fullness of the word and that was Jesus Christ well do you realize that every Prophet every Sage every every patriarch I I believe with all of my heart amen that Not only was the word speaking of a of a bridegroom but it was also speaking of a bride amen and they kept pointing the people to a fullness that was to come amen he's coming he's coming he coming amen but I I just believe that in all of this every type every shatter kept saying she's coming she's coming she's coming there's going to be another Oneness that will take place there will be a union come amen I believe yes sir it's the bright coming of Christ the bright coming you realize that there are more scriptures that pertain to our day than even Jesus day brother brah said there's many more scriptures in the Old Testament pertaining to the second coming of Christ than there was to be uh was to the first coming of Christ think of that more scriptures more scriptures speaking of this age and than it was even that age and God promised and and I won't keep you much longer but God promised to restore the whole word of God again amen no notice the full manifestation of Christ in a physical body no no no no the full manifestation of Christ in his church amen sir by how's it going to happen by shining forth the evening light thank God for a prophet sir thank God for this message thank God for not just leaving us guessing but he had his picture taken with him to vindicate this is the one and by this message by this messenger and his message there will be a manifestation of fullness again of Christ in his church oh God Have Mercy by this message there is coming a union amen thank you Jesus I hope it makes sense to you yes sir thank you Jes by this evening light message there is a people ripening in the presence of the sun believe you believe it Proverbs 31:10 oh yeah says who can find a virtuous woman who is that woman that's not going to be a prostitute who is that woman that's not going to be scarred with men hello now we're I again I believe that scripture is prophetic of our day oh yeah we're living in the in in a an adulterous everybody say an adulterous Wicked evil generation yes sir yes I'm going to be honest you probably couldn't find Harley Harley at all a young girl a young man couldn't hardly ever you know in this day I'm sure it's becoming more hard to find a virgin to marry in this age and not only just for girls but but boys are becoming so polluted in their mind with pornography they done a study one reporter went around just asking women if it's okay if their husband if if it was called cheating to be with a prostitute most everyone said no we don't consider it cheating if they need to go do their thing let them do it as long as they don't fall in love but you see where the sacredness has come oh my it's it's lost its sacredness everything about uh a man and a woman and the marriage vows and the the intimacy and and the things of that a marriage should be it's out the window anymore you you'll you'll see you know five guys at a restaurant and one woman and girl sitting with them sure it it's there's just everybody wants to be common everybody wants to even even courtship anymore has lost its sacredness it's you got the social media and and you got girls talking to every guy in the country and they're just all buddies and and the poor guy that wants to try to date her you know where does he fit in in all this it it it's just you know they they lose their Sac everything's lost its sacredness today very true I've I've you know I tried to teach my children you know don't don't spill your heart just every every Tom Dick and Harry out there right CU you're not going to marry every Tom and Dick and Harry amen thank you God's got Jim for you God's got somebody for you you know what I'm saying yes sir keep your heart to yourself keep it sacred that's good for the for your spouse that's beautiful right and and and so but now you're looking at the church good Lord God wants to share love Secrets right is not this message love secrets to us is not this word love secrets to us come on Church it is the prophet said it is it's love Secrets but how many people just just reject it as nothing you know I mean I mean come on now when when when when the guy and a girl they you know the boy you know girl's the boy want you know if he's going to go want if he's Laing you and you you've agreed and all that he he he he wants some time he don't want to have to spend time with you and five other guys maybe I'm too oldfashioned I don't know but I I just believe that's the same way God is too am yes sir the church is too occupied yes they are they got too many things it's like a social network marriage is like social well it's becoming that is it not it is it where no sacredness anymore but who can find that virtuous woman that's what God's looking for is it not there has to be some woman that's going to be one with him so he asked who can find a virtuous woman notice her Pro her price is far above rubies you she's Priceless you ain't going to put a price on this yeah can you say amen amen you understand that see the heart lsen notice and and let's put god with this see God being the husband God being the bridegroom he's looking for this bride who can find a virtuous woman for her price is far above rues for the heart of her husband does safely safely trust in her Hall you are the people that God's heart has now he's able to trust you with these secrets he's able to trust you with himself he's able to give you his energy and trust you with thisy to God can you say man he's able to give you his word and trust you with it because you're not a prostitute you're not running around just sleeping around and giving your heart to every man man anyone that comes it's now become a sacred thing this message is sacred to us the heart of her husband does safely trust in her so that he shall have no need of spoil she will do him good and not evil all the days of her life prise God do you realize how beautiful you are in his eyes you know how much of a treasure you are as his bride to him God have mercy now what are we called God would call through a speak to us through a prophet and say you are the pure virtuous sinless Bride of the son of the Living God thank God every man and woman that's born of the spirit of God and washed in the blood of Jesus Christ and believes every word of God am stands as though you never sinned at the first place you are perfect what say can you say that I am perfect I am perfect why the blood of Jesus Christ makes you perfect it you're the little lady that
