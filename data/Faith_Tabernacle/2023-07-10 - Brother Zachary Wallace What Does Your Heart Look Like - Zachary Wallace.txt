of the Lord amen it is beyond measure it's beyond in the expression of value or worth without it we would be lost to ask you if you'd have your Bibles tonight we'll just get right in and try not to hold you too long tonight but uh I sure appreciate how you pulled on the word this morning I had a good time and just enjoyed the presence of the Lord here but uh tomorrow I'm getting on a flight heading to Czech Republic for a youth camp there and so my uh I focus on a group of young people there that's 13 and under and so you you kind of have to think about the gospel in in simpler ways which for me just blesses me and if so you'll have to put up with me tonight I'm just gonna kind of give you a Sunday school lesson and uh it's simple but if you pay attention you can find God in Simplicity and we'll just we'll just ask that Lord can deal with our hearts in that but in Matthew the fifth chapter and verse 8 Matthew 5 and 8. the scripture says blessed are the pure in heart for they shall see God blessed are the pure in heart for they shall see God now how are you going to get a pure heart what are you going to do what efforts are you going to put in to get a pure heart there's nothing that you can produce that will give you a pure heart but there is a blood and it's enough to make the vile a sinner clean blessed are the pure and heart for they shall see God and now over in Revelations the third chapter we'll go to the address to the laodicean age there verse 20. Revelations 3 and 20. it says behold I stand at the door and knock If any man hear my voice and open the door I will come into him and will sup with him and he with me I just want to ask the question for my title tonight what does your heart look like let's go to the Lord and Lord of Prayer dear Lord Jesus we thank you for your goodness to us and for your presence here Among Us Lord I just ask Lord that you would come down and through the foolishness of preaching that you would say something that would help one of your children here tonight Lord I just ask that you would have Liberty in this service and that we would understand a little clearer Lord we would see a little better Lord how you would want us to live and how we should approach you father I just ask that you'd have your way now in Jesus Christ's name amen may be seated tonight so my question is is what does your heart look like and you're all familiar with this this statement of a knocking on the door I'm sure I'm sure you've all listened to door to the heart or doors and door many different times and so we're going to be looking at some of those thoughts right there but when you look at the human heart and you see this human heart they have a picture of Jesus drawn where he's knocking on the door and he's holding a lantern and he's he's waiting to get in and and they took it to the hall of critics and they were looking over the picture and they says you know you spent these years your life drawing this painting and it's a it's a wonderful picture it's a beautiful painting but you you really made a big mistake with your picture of Jesus coming to the human heart and he says well what did I miss and they said well you forgot to put a handle on the door he said oh no I didn't he says the handle is not on the outside the handle is on the inside and it's the individual alone that can open that door up and let the Lord Jesus Christ in them and so you know there's there's many different people I was just talking to a group of 10 year olds about people knocking on your door and I said well who's a popular YouTube person that would be knocking on your door and and they were mentioning uh Mark Rober they mentioned uh Mr Beast they mentioned I can't remember some of the other names they're like I says if these people these popular UT people were knocking on your door you know would you open the door they're like yeah yeah you know a lot of times they give away money to people and stuff and so they were all excited about you know what if this person was knocking on their door you know and and I said you know what about maybe some some famous or wealthy people like and they're like yeah like uh what's some wealthy people can you help me here Trump's wealthy Rockefeller and he did I think if he's knocking on my door I'm nervous no um uh Elon Musk yeah yeah uh what's somebody else that's uh real wealthy right now Hudson Joe Biden hi maybe um he's more on the famous side than the wealthy side I think but uh you know if you had one of those people knocking on your door and you look out and you recognize this is some you know multi-billionaire you might be interested in opening the door you'd look out and it would definitely catch your attention and uh so I was asking maybe you know some famous people some powerful people most of the the famous people to these these young people were uh were social media influencers things like that that's what they consider to be famous um powerful people I would think of would be you know leaders of Nations and things like that and if you had you know the the governor or the the leader of our nation or or someone that was real well-known real powerful person and they were knocking on your door there would be a lot of interest and you would want to open the door to find out what they're doing there Ruth if the president came and knocked on your door would you be interested to know why he was there yeah me too you know the I found out the Queen of England was dead but if the Queen of England was knocking on your door um you know I was kind of interested to find out that that was the same queen that brother Branham would have been talking about when he says what if she come through and visited your home it's like she lived a long time you know but uh you know if someone like that came and visited your home how would you treat them what would you do if they were knocking at that door and all of them were saying well I'd open the door and find out what they were wanting to do or find out what they were there for and you know that's that's how we would treat somebody that was of Earthly value but the person who comes of the greatest value the greatest importance with the greatest gifts to bring is the Lord Jesus Christ and he's turned away again and again and again they don't got time for him they can't be bothered with what he has to offer and yet there'd be no one greater that would knock at that door and you know we look at the we look at the human heart and it's a place that has many different compartments many different doors so when you go through the front door Ruth you step into the house and after the first door you're on the you're on the welcoming mat and after that right over here is another door and another door and another door there's different areas in that human heart and if if we were invited you know brother Josiah invited us over to his home last night and we stayed the night there and you know if we'd have walked in the door and we we come in and we step through the bees not the front door it's the side door because the front door don't get used and we step in the side door he says oh so good to have you just I'm really happy to see you here you know Welcome to our home and we say thank you thank you and we wipe our feet off on the floor mat and we take a step he said what are you doing no I feel like I I was just gonna go over there he's like no I didn't say you could go there it's like oh okay you know um so you know I go over here to the to the side of the room and he's like get back on that mat like okay you know it wouldn't take me very long to head back out that door because he doesn't really want me there he didn't really make me welcome he said oh yeah come on over called me up you know and I drove a long ways and I finally got there and then all he wanted me to do was to stand at the door I'd go somewhere else I'd find somewhere where I could actually be comfortable I'd find somewhere where I would really be welcome and we all say Lord Jesus come come to my heart come to my home but is he welcome is he welcome in your private life is he welcome in every little section of your heart or is he just welcome to step in the front door and and come and save you from hell because that's all you really care about now for for uh for myself and for the young people I I made up a a nice big heart here and uh I've got it all sectioned off in these different areas of the human heart and I've got some residents for the heart here all right now when you come to this world you are born in sin you're shaped in iniquity you come to the world speaking lies and your heart is not a very good place and so we're going to put a nice big thing of unbelief in there all right and his compatriot of doubt so there we are now that heart isn't looking very good is it and you know what you were just born and that's where you start out at all right you I don't care who you are I don't care how long you've been alive if you've been alive for 60 seconds you came a counterfeit way a counterfeit's condemned to start with and so this person is condemned from the very start which is why Jesus Christ paid a price to redeem the entire world but when you come to Earth you've got these different compartments and so brother Amos we're going to put this in your private life what's some little roach that might slip into that private life you go ahead think about it what is it give it a name the kids wanted to name it Jerry we're not naming it Jerry all right what is this internet yeah yeah all right your internet history there we go slips in there nobody else knows about it but you do uh what's something else we might put over here in uh in the human heart just give it a name shalom something that's not good slips into the human heart it's a sin jealousy all right we'll slide that in here I got a lot of these so keep thinking Hudson hatred oh yeah you know this guy here he slips in and you know these are little cockroaches and they don't need much of a gap they don't need a great big Open Door they'll just find a little crevice and they slip in and once one gets in there next thing you know there's two next thing you know there's ten next thing you know there's hundreds of them because there was just enough of an opening for One little guy to get in and you know they make a mess and nobody really wants them there they come anyway what are you gonna call this one stealing robbery all right we'll put that right there one of the boys I said something in your private life he said killing people it's like that's probably not going to stay private but what do you call it all this one brother bitterness oh man I need some uglier spiders for this we'll put some bitterness down in that heart right there oh yeah shamaya brother shamaya what are we going to call this Feller gossip yes sir yeah one time he was preaching he says I thought I preached about all the sins there was in the in the book you know I preached about everything and if it got to the end of the service and my sister came up says bless God brother Brandon you never touched on me tonight he says well praise God you must be close to the kingdom and uh you turned to his sister he says you know that sister he says yes he says well she must be a saint he says well there's one thing you didn't preach about tonight and that was gossip and she's the cheese gossip in the whole County keeping that tongue under control Matthew okay what's this one Pride you know that's an entire section in the human heart Branson all right this is getting dangerous what do you call this one line yes sir put that over there all right Ruth did you name one you didn't okay what are we gonna call this guy some sin that slips into a person's heart faith selfishness very good we'll put that right in there all right Levi hatefulness yeah we put hatred in there already he's already there it's big and ugly nasty little thing all right uh what about you right back here young lady what's your name Ayla all right what are we going to call this ugly little bug what kind of a little sin is this that would slip into a human heart what about you sister jealousy that's a good one what would you call this one backbiting ouch put a little back biting in here yes sir ma'am sorry um all right David do you got a name for this one it's the last one I got nothing Teresa no okay oh I'd call this misusing your time putting stuff before God we got to do something here we got we've got an empty oil Mr unbelief can take that one okay so Mr unbelief will take care of this and we'll put this guy over here this guy over here put this right here all right we got everything Plum contaminated all right born in sin shaped iniquity come to the world speaking lies and on the outside you look pretty good this is the inside you know God doesn't see the way we see we'll look at uh see Matthew right yes come on up here and no no your your mark this is Mark okay you're Matthew then all right Matthew Mark Matthew Mark is there Luke in here all right bro Branson come here all right so one day God was looking for a man that he could use in his kingdom and the prophet came and he called Jesse's Sons together and he came to him and he grabbed he grabbed the anointing oil and he came over and he was looking for somebody that God could use to lead his people he brought that anointing oil and he looked at the first one alive he says surely this is the one I mean just look at him he's he's a man that's just incredible and he went to pour the oil and God says I have not chosen him he says do not look on his appearance says for God looks at the heart and she says no that's not the one he went to the next one and he was ready to pour the oil on him God says no that's not the one went to the next one he says no that's not the one and he gets to the end of his seven sons he's like God told me there was a boy here that was going to be Anointed with oil so what's you know what gives he says you wouldn't happen to have another boy he's like oh I got a little guy out in the field taking care of some sheep he's like his name was David David can you come up here is that okay all right that's all right we can grab this little guy right here and so they go out and they get David taking care of the Sheep and God says that is the man that is after my own heart he says you know these guys they might be big they might be strong you know if we were going to have an arm wrestling match this guy probably wouldn't win but God chose this one why the heart it's the heart that God looks at not the outward appearance and so many times though we'll look at the outward appearance and we'll say well this is how it looks you know they look great things are looking good but the heart what's that heart look like what does your heart look like tonight does it got that little bug of backbiting in there putting things before God doesn't see how nice you look how well-dressed you are how strong and muscular you might be that's not what God's saying people they might look at it and they say if I was going to pick who was going to be the military leaders of our nation I probably wouldn't pick that kid but that's not how God looks at things thanks guys God looks at the heart the scripture I need to read that directly it's really powerful because then the Lord said unto Samuel how long will you he says go to Jesse's house right right um live comes up he says but in first Samuel 16 verse 7. he says but the Lord said unto him Samuel look not on his countenance or on the height of his stature because I have refused him for the Lord seeth not as man seeth for man looketh on the outward appearance but the Lord looketh on the heart and so right now in this building I'm looking at you at the outward appearance God is looking at your heart he sees that little bitterness that's down in there he sees that little thing that nobody else might see in your private life but he sees it because he sees the heart and you know right now the scripture says to repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit so I've drawn out me here a little Dove okay somebody else did I'm not much of an artist but here's this little Dove of the Holy Spirit do you think this is a welcoming place you think this devil the holy spirit's gonna be able to come down and build its nest in that heart absolutely not it's incompatible now there's not one thing you can do to take that unbelief that doubt to take that sin and wash your heart out there's nothing you can do you can't do it that's right but there is a toxin there is a blood that can take and cleanse out that heart but if we if we ask the Lord to come in we come to the Lord we say God I have need of you I need you in my heart so Levi we welcome them in we say God I need you and so he comes down and he he comes through the door and he we ask him to forgive us and he cleans those areas out and that's wonderful that's a wonderful start you know we'll compare this to like justification we get Justified We Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ as our savior that's wonderful you've accepted him as your savior but there's a lot of other areas in your life that need dealt with and you are the one that opens the door he does not force his way in he is a gentleman if you tell him he can't go in there he won't go in there you have to open up that door and say God I want you to come in to this area of my life I want you to enter in here I want to make you welcome now one of the first doors in that heart is the door of pride you know that's a door that some people never will let the Lord Jesus Christ in that door of Pride will be there and they'll say that's mine you're not going to Humble me you're not going to humiliate me I'm going to do this I'm going to look good I'm gonna he won't Force his way in that door of Pride Abraham says you know some of them ladies with that Pride they say now look I'm I'm going down here now Jesus Is My Savior all right but when he tells me how I'm going to dress you keep out of that room but you see he's got to be Lord over your dressing too now if it's going to interfere with me wearing shorts I don't want nothing to do with that kind of a religion see you don't want to open that door of Pride you're all stuck up if I can't wear wear lipstick or stuff on put that on my face if I can't wear that well then I'll go on to show how you are not letting him be the Lord of your heart he's come in and you're saying God I want you as my savior but you don't want to miss your lord now friends this isn't something that just happens one time you can be serving God for 20 years and then close the door you see he's got to come in completely he's got to be welcomed in every door thrown wide every portion of that heart emptied out if you want him to dwell there if you want him to truly be your lord it's not going to look like this and so we're going to open up this this door of of Pride here cut that open we open it up and we let him come in and clean out something and that's wonderful now we're kind of looking at more of a sanctification as we open up each individual part of our life and part of our heart and we let him come in and begin to do that work that that only he can do cutting out these these barriers I I wasn't sure how to make all kinds of doors so I just put barriers and as he's welcomed in he cleans out those areas but if you'll ever stop and just say that's enough that's where it'll stop and he will never make his Abode there he can't do it he is a holy spirit he will not feel an Unholy vessel but if you'll just cut open every area of your heart you'll just open up he'll come in and he'll begin to clean out all of that Pride he'll begin to take out all that indifference he'll be able to take out that that back biting and that gossip he'll begin to take out those things that are there that just would would tear apart your life he'll take that unbelief and that doubt and he'll eradicate it out of your heart and it'll be pulsating with faith take away that lying spirit that's stealing that stealing of God's time where God's not put first beginning to tear down those Idols of the heart and it's getting cleaned out and it's looking good friends that looking a lot better oh it's looking a lot better still that private life and there's still things in that private life we've got some bitterness and we got some jealousy until those are dealt with he's still not welcome until every area until every aspect of our life has been opened up and he comes in as Lord of your heart as Lord of your life he's not welcome but if you'll really just completely yield and you'll die out to yourself baptism in the name of Jesus Christ is a representation of death amen you have died out and you have been born again in a new life with a cleaned out heart now we've got a place where the Lord Jesus Christ can be welcomed and when that heart is well open cleaned out sanctif Justified Sanctified now we have a place where the Holy Spirit could come and build its nest go look into that building its nest there I never really seen that before go in there and build its nest this dwelling place in your heart now that is a wonderful wonderful condition to be in cleaned out scrubbed out every portion of your heart open welcoming the Lord Jesus sin scripture says in Isaiah you know over Isaiah 1 18 I'm going to be traveling soon and when we get there we give them my we give them US Dollars and they give us Euros or or money for whatever country you're in and when you do that you have what's called an exchange rate and so you give them so many dollars they give you so many euros I think Euros might be like a dollar fifty or a one one or one dollar and fifty cents would get me one Euro so it's not a very good exchange rate um whereas like if you go up to Canada if I give them one dollar they'll give me maybe a dollar twenty five a dollar fifty and change so you get a better exchange rate when you're going to Canada you know there's there's different exchanges well let me show you the best exchange rate that's ever been come now and let us reason together saith the Lord though your sins be as Scarlet they shall be as white as snow though they be red like Crimson they shall be as Leep now that's an exchange rate right there you bring me your filthy dirty heart you bring me these things that you have in your life that's just as bad as it can be and I'll take that heart and I'll wash it and I'll purify it and it will be as wide as snow amen you bring me your sin and I'll bring you eternal life that is an exchange rate that's worth talking about but God requires you to give him all of your heart not 99 of it all of your heart and it happens every day you see we go through our daily life and you know we let that temper flare up and we begin to to to say some things that we shouldn't you know what happens that dub of the Holy Spirit takes her flight she goes up here she doesn't go very far away she just goes there and she's waiting until that heart is welcoming again and I'm afraid friends that we spend far too many days and our Christian experience with the Holy Ghost just waiting to get back in he's already chosen you he's already made his Dwelling Place there and then we allow that that human nature to flare up again we began to to say well but I've got some rights you know and I deserve oh when you begin to hear that word come in your mind saying well you know I've done so much I really deserve a little bit of this or that or the other 99 of the time friends all you're doing is just you know publishing the devil's propaganda bridge I deserve a little no you don't usually that's that's just a flimsy excuse and you know we'll we'll let a little something happen let a root of bitterness spring up in our heart you know that thing's a great big ugly thing that root of bitterness will drive the Holy Spirit out of your life I watched that happen too a Sunday school teacher as a boy their family got bittered about something precious people some I mean to this day some of those precious people you ever meet got bitter in their heart quit going to church pretty soon their children were just married to people in the world their marriages fell apart within a few years their homes were just in chaos and we my father went to the brother he says brother you're you're a real man you're you're like there wasn't no pretend about you you were a real Christian what what are you doing he said oh well you know I just don't feel it in my heart anymore he says but you know you you've made a commitment to the lord it's not about how you're feeling about this you see when he let that in there it just began to drive everything out and bring a whole lot of other things in and yes sir and you know a few years later his his wife looked at him and says you know I just don't feel it in my heart anymore she walked out the door same words he'd spoke to his wife or to God he said well I spoke back to him life just an absolute I I don't have a happy solution to that story right now I believe he's a child of God friends don't let one day go by without you dying out to yourself and committing yourself once again saying God forgive me of those things let me die if Saint Paul had to Die daily friends sure don't try and tell me you're so spiritual that you only have to do it once a year there's a daily yielding a daily surrender as you walk with the Lord Jesus to make him welcome in there now Abraham says here won't you tonight while he's knocking at your door say Lord I now open the door come in O king of glory glory and save me and open up the doors of my heart I open up my Door of Faith my door of Pride my door of indifference my door of selfishness all the doors of my heart I swing open To You O Lord of oh Lord Jesus Jesus is standing present now That Door of Faith if you'll let him in that door all things will be possible to you but if you keep that door closed and you're just worried that you might look like a fanatic he won't Force his way in you know we have that opportunity right now to open the door to Christ we have that opportunity to to let him be the ruler and the Lord of our life there was a young man one time who had that opportunity and he refused it Jesus Christ looked him right in the eye and says forsake it all and follow me and that man went away sorrowful because he had a lot of possessions he had a lot of things that he valued more than following the Lord Jesus Jesus told him take up the cross and follow me and he went away sad because he couldn't let go of those things you know Simon the Cyrene when he picked up that cross but the Branham says that when he picked up the cross of the Lord Jesus he says the blood that was on that cross caught on Simon let me carry my cross let me carry my portion of the load how many people denied have sunk beyond the regions of Mercy into a devil's Hell in a torment of a nightmare how they'd love to come back and have one more chance what would they do tonight if Jesus would come to hell and knock at their door that Rich Young Ruler when he lifted up his eyes in hell he looked up at Abraham and he says let Lazarus come bring me a drop of water it can't be done he says well you know let somebody go back and begin to preach the gospel to my brothers tell them don't do what I did tell them to follow Jesus tell them that this is the wrong way to go he says they've got the prophet's message why would they listen to Lazarus if he raised from the dead but he had once he got into that condition he had a perspective he had a vision of what actually mattered because he'd been building bigger Barns and bigger Barns and grown his business and doing all these different things and God says Thou fool this night thy soul is required of Thee Braham teaches the sermon the lamb and the dove all right and and you all know these things this is this is Sunday school for you I'm sure but there's a lamb and that's the Holy Spirit and the only thing that that Holy Spirit will rest on is a lamb nature you see that at the Jordan River when that that Holy Spirit came down and rested on the Lamb of God that was to take the sin of the world there was that lamb and Dove relationship and it will only rest on a lamb but the problem is is when you come into this world you're born as a wolf and there's no continuity between the Holy Spirit and that nature and so you have to have a nature change you have to die you literally die out on the altar of God and another life enters him which is his spirit and now this lamb and Dove relationship is the only way it's the only continuity there is Between Heaven and Earth is that lamb and of relationship but you still have down on the inside it you still got that wolf of nature that's still in there because you're still in a mortal flesh body don't tell me that this body doesn't want to sin don't tell me that this body doesn't have temptations because it does and if you are not careful and you do not keep your body under subjection that wolf nature will resurrect itself and it'll step out and it'll begin to snarl and it'll begin to backbite and it'll begin to spread things through the church and begin to do all this stuff that Holy Spirit takes its flight it's not compatible with that wolf nature and so you know well what do you do if if you're if your fleshly nature begins to snarl a little bit and grieve the Holy Spirit die You Gotta Die Out submit yourself and let him come in again as the Lord of your life now Birmingham talks about I'm just going to read it we've got a little bit time um Bill Graham says in the church and its condition if you want to hear a sermon that will really just kind of scour your heart out that's a good one he doesn't he doesn't pull no punches in there he says the first thing you know when you started doing those things you let down the bars you begin compromising then the church began to get little clicks and among them and this one said you know the pastor's just so and so or the deacons so and so and the first thing you know you listen to that and that's the reason you have so much trouble is because you begin to listen to the devil he didn't say it was your the person you were listening to he said it was the devil you were listening to that's pretty strong he says you listen to the devil and get a snarl instead of listening to The Gentle Dove and the Holy Spirit the dove of God that would lead you and guide you love you and bless you first time you get one of those little temper spasm the dove flies right away that's right she can't stand it her Nature's different she can't stand that at all and you go to talking about your neighbor she can't stand that she just won't put up with it he just takes his flight and goes on away he just can't stand it any longer the dove is gentle the dove is Meek and the Dove and and the and they can't stand nothing unless it's the same kind of a nature now God can make you a different nature man or woman he can give you a different nature and you say well brother Branham what can we do about it just become a lamb again if the only two animals will ever associate together that's the Dove and the lamb the dove won't come to anything else but a lamb and if you become a goat then that old goatee Spirit get that old goatee Spirit off of you that's right if you become something else get it away from you and so I you know many different times in your life you're going to have a goatee spirit that doesn't de-christianize you there's gonna be many different times in your life when you find that wolf beginning to snarl and and you're on the way to church and your wife says something and you snarl back at her and and suddenly you get to church and two wolves walk in the back door you know it's not a good situation well what do you do about that does that mean you're not a Christian anymore no no but you got to humble yourself you got to get down and you got to get that goatee nature off of you and come back to being a Glam again now something the program I won't read them all but he says it again and again and again he says that he says it doesn't go very far away and that's such an encouragement to me friends because there's been many a time when that wolf nature is resurrected in my life and but he says it here again and again he says um he says that holy spirit that you you grieve the Holy Spirit he says but he's not very far away he says oh he talks about how we get into this condition and it's so bad um he says the dove can't leave you because you know too much or there's no place for the dove to roost in your life because you've got all these other things in there um he says but what's the remedy what's the remedy today the remedy is this you just be the lamb God is still the dove now he hasn't flew very far says it again and again he just flew up on the right up on the tree just ahead of you there he's longing and he's waiting to see a time when you'll just surrender yourself and say oh precious Dove of God come back to my heart again she's not a long way the Holy Spirit isn't isn't greed and a million miles away it's just right there just just waiting just above your shoulder on a little Branch right there just saying won't you just get that heart right I want to come in this is my Dwelling Place this is my temple this is my habitation I want to get back in there but as long as you let that little bit of bitterness in there he's not welcome a root of bitterness is a horrible horrible thing but we've got to continually look for for things that might creep up in our heart and you look at that the the the where Jesus said the word goes out and it's sowed among thorny thorns and thistles and these different things and I believe that can be our heart on different times of the week different you know days of of of the year we'll come to church and we might come to church with a bit of a Stony heart and we walk out and we just didn't get a thing we might come to church sometimes and we've got so much going on at work we've got so many thorns and thistles there we really didn't get a whole lot but if we'll get good prepared ground you can walk away with a harvest Abraham says here in Jehovah Jireh and we know that every seed or promise of God will bring forth of its kind what it promised if it strikes the right ground the ground that's prepared ready all the Rocks has been thrown out and The Roots and the bitterness and selfishness and indifference and jealousy has all been grubbed out as far as I understand that means you get it out by the roots grubbed out and that root of bitterness that Springs up that sometimes so spoils the thing that God is trying to do we pray God that that won't be among us but that the good word will find good ground in these I I believe that we have a a ground that's been prepared we have a heart that's ready to receive it and if we see some little spider or some little cockroach that slipped into our hearts slipped into our life just step on it just squash the little thing we don't have to put up with it we don't have to compromise with it we don't have to live with it you know in the in the mental health world the only thing they can do with with psychologists and and the medications as far as I've seen is they can teach you how to live with your problem they can teach you how to cope with it uh when when my wife was having the mental health issues we were exploring what's what's the options out here what can they do and the only thing they could do was was like give you a crunch they couldn't heal the broken leg and I was like well that's just not really a solution you don't have to live with anything in that heart you don't have to put up with it you don't have to live with that devil you don't have to live with that thing in your heart you have there is a Power in the Blood of Jesus Christ to take those things completely out of your heart I don't care how wrongly you were treated I don't care how much you have a right to be bitter you think I don't care how bad it was that blood of the Lord Jesus Christ can completely cleanse that heart brother Graham says if if you think if a brother you think he's a little wrong or a sister say Lord don't let me never have the root of bitterness spring up because it'll affect him and it'll take the Christ right out of my life that poison acids of malice and jealousy and hatred that will just take the Holy Spirit right away from you it will run him from the Tabernacle here here it'll kill the spirit of God or drive it from here hurt your pastor it'll do everything see don't you do that don't come to church with a pile of ease in your heart friends don't do it what this church needs is one or two good members cleansed with their hearts set of five by fire by the power of the Holy Spirit it would do more for this church than 40 revivals would the musicians would come I want to uh let's go ahead and stand to our feet I want to read at one last quote but you see when we let the Lord Jesus Christ into our heart we welcome him in our heart's been cleaned out it's been it's been made a suitable place for him let him truly be the Lord of your heart don't don't block out any section give him your best give him everything that you are there was a woman one time that seen Jesus sitting there with dirty feet sermon the unwelcomed Christ and talks about that woman seeing him with dirty feet seeing him there in somebody's home but he wasn't really welcome so she went to get an alabaster box and she said I want the best that you got you see he is worthy of the best what do you do for him give him the leftover oh yes you run around all day and you give him three minutes at night before you go to bed Jesus deserves your best friend he deserves everything you got but what do you do about it you give him just anything he takes it he takes it anywhere how he takes it but she said I want the best and it cost her everything she had to get the best that's what you want to do give your best give him your best give him the best of your life give him the best of your songs give him all your talent give him everything you got give him your feet give him your hands give him your eyes give him your mouth give him your ears give him your soul give him your heart give him your praise give him everything you got he's deserving of the best [Music] he's deserving of it friends now I've seen Idols to pagan gods built out of concrete and latex paint they don't deserve nothing they have no power they can't do anything for you you have to take care of them but our God is not like that we serve a god that is living in present to do the exceedingly abundantly more than we could ever dream or even ask [Music] deserving friends deserving of all of your heart he's just you say oh well I serve the Lord the Lord's he's he's Supreme in my life [Music] what are you doing with your time [Music] are you you see when you look at your time you find out where you really value things you find out where your heart really is at Hudson here he loves to go fishing I mean he just loves he's a fish and fanatic and you know what every opportunity he gets he sees a creek he sees a pond he drove by this New River down here he's like hey can I go fishing there it's like no I gotta study tomorrow Hudson he's like well you can go listen to a message and watch me fish next day he's at how many times did he ask you to take him fishing Josiah at least a dozen times take me fishing take me fishing you see he just loves to go fishing [Music] so that's what he wants to do with his time and I understand we have responsibilities but what do you do with your free time what do you do with your time that's actually your right to decide what you need to do with it because you don't have to go you know take care of responsibilities how are you using that that's where your heart is my question said things in your heart that are ahead of God I'm just asking us to not to to check our hearts what does your heart look like I don't know you all look mighty nice to me on the outside but what's that heart look like is it all barred up is it eating up with bitterness are the things in there that you'd be ashamed for anybody to see a examination of that heart or is it plunged beneath that precious blood is it cleansed of everything and is every dwarf thrown wide open saying Lord come in and be the Lord of my life because that's what he's looking for this in this hour he is looking for hearts where he can come down and be in preeminence in a people his desire is to find individuals that will place him as the true Lord of their life so he can come down and express himself as God Almighty in individuals so they won't anymore just be the human beings walking around but it'll actually be deity incarnate on this Earth for that's exactly what Jesus Christ was he was a man and he was God and in this hour God has created a plan and a purpose so that individuals human beings can be filled with the spirit of God and so yielded that it's no longer them but it's almighty God walking around on this Earth as misses Jesus Christ God in preeminence in a people but it comes down to that heart [Music] I surrender all the kingdoms of my heart do
