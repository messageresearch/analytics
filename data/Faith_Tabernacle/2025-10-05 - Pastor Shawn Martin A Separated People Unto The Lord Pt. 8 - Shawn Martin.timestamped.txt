[38:56] way has been long, but I'm blessed.
[39:00] [Music]
[39:11] Now I've had my share of sunshine and
[39:15] rain. Days filled with laughter and
[39:19] nights filled with pain. But with every
[39:23] mile as I travel this way, the journey
[39:27] gets sweeter each day.
[39:31] Well, it's been a long journey, but I
[39:35] have been blessed walking with Jesus. I
[39:39] have no regrets.
[39:42] He is so good to me. I must confess the
[39:47] way has been long, but I'm blessed.
[39:51] Well, it's been a long journey, but I

[40:07] way has been long, but I'm blessed.

[42:17] Okay.
[42:20] Little David. Oh, so small. That giant,
[42:24] he's so tall. The odds were just too
[42:28] high for little David.
[42:33] So he shook off all of his foes. For
[42:37] with the power of God, he was clothed.
[42:40] The battle's not mine. I give it to you,
[42:43] Lord. It's mine.
[42:46] Oh, the battle's not mine, said little
[42:49] David. Lord, inside I'm in your favor.
[42:54] I've given it all to you. For I knew not
[42:59] what to do, and I'm so glad you let me
[43:03] see.
[43:05] Oh, you're really all that I need. The
[43:08] battle's not mine. I give it to you,
[43:11] Lord. It's time.
[43:15] Now little David unafraid
[43:19] before the giant he stood that day and
[43:22] it seemed to be the end for little
[43:26] David.
[43:29] But like the lion in the bed that he
[43:31] slew that old giant he had to come to.
[43:36] The battle's not mine. I give it to you,
[43:40] Lord. It's thine.
[43:43] I said, "The battle's not mine." Said,
[43:45] "Little David, Lord, it's that I'm in
[43:49] your favor.
[43:51] I knew not what to do. Lord, I knew not
[43:56] what to do. I'm so glad you made me see
[44:02] that you're really all that I need. The
[44:05] battle's not mine. Give it to you, Lord.
[44:09] And it's that
[44:12] now little David he stood tall and that
[44:16] giant he's so small. Sweet victory had
[44:22] rained for little David.
[44:26] Oh cuz he gave the battle to one who
[44:30] believed in getting things done. The
[44:33] battle's not mine. I give it to you,
[44:37] Lord. It's not.
[44:40] The battle's not mine, said little
[44:43] David. Lord, it's not. I'm in your
[44:46] favor.
[44:48] I've given it all to you. For I knew not
[44:53] what to do. I'm so glad you made me see.
[44:59] You're really all that I need. The
[45:02] battle's not mine. I give it to you,
[45:05] Lord. It's done.
[45:08] Oh, the battle's not mine, said little
[45:12] David. Lord, it's not. I'm in your
[45:15] favor.
[45:17] I've given it all to you. For I knew not
[45:21] what to do. Oh, I'm so glad you made me
[45:26] see.
[45:28] You're really all that I need. The
[45:30] battle's not mine. I give it to you,
[45:34] Lord. It's thine.
[45:37] Oh, the battle's not mine. I give it to
[45:40] you, Lord. It's thine.
[45:46] [Applause]
[45:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. Do you believe the battle belongs
[45:56] to the Lord?
[45:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. Can we stand to our feet as we
[45:59] invite our pastor to come?
[46:04] Just a little while to stay here.
[46:10] Just a little while to wait.
[46:16] Just a little while to labor
[46:21] in the path that's always straight.
[46:27] Just a little more of trouble
[46:32] in this low and sinful state.
[46:38] Then we'll enter heaven's portals,
[46:43] sweeping through the pearly gates.
[46:49] Soon this life will all be over
[46:55] and all pilgrims will end.
[46:59] Oh, soon we'll take our heavenly
[47:03] journey.
[47:06] Be at home again with friends.
[47:10] [Applause]
[47:11] Heaven's gates are standing open,
[47:17] waiting for our entrance there.
[47:21] Oh, some sweet day we're going over.

[47:50] in the path that's always straight.
[47:55] Oh, just a little more of trouble
[48:00] in the slow and sinful state.
[48:06] And then we'll enter heaven's portals,
[48:11] sweeping through the perfectly gate.
[48:17] Soon we'll see the light of morning.
[48:22] Then the new day will begin.
[48:27] Oh, soon we'll hear the father calling.
[48:33] Come my children, enter in.
[48:39] Then we'll hear a choir of angels
[48:44] singing out the victory song.
[48:49] [Music]
[48:50] All our troubles will be ended
[48:55] and we'll live with heaven's thr. Oh
[48:59] yes, just a little while.

[49:12] in the wild.
[49:19] always straight.
[49:22] Just a little more of trouble
[49:28] in this low and sinful state.
[49:33] Then we'll enter heaven's portal,
[49:38] sweeping through the pearl, sing that
[49:42] chorus again. Oh, just a little while to
[49:46] stay.
[49:49] Just a little while to wait.
[49:54] Just a little while to labor
[50:00] in the path that's always straight.
[50:05] Just a little more of trouble
[50:10] in this low and sinful state.
[50:16] Then we'll enter heaven's portal,
[50:21] sweeping through the pearly gates.
[50:28] You know, that song is becoming more of
[50:30] a reality to us. Looking forward to that
[50:34] time and and it ain't going to be too
[50:36] much longer. And um I um you know, it's
[50:41] just an amazing the promises that we
[50:44] have and in in the future. Our future is
[50:46] so bright.
[50:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. And uh there's just no reason to
[50:51] give up and to quit and Amen. pressing
[50:55] on. Ain't that right?
[50:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. and the musicians can be dismissed
[50:59] and um uh enjoyed the songs today and
[51:05] the worship of God's people.
[51:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. And um if you have your Bibles,
[51:12] we're going to turn to Deuteronomy the
[51:14] 26th chapter.
[51:17] And uh we want to remember our fall
[51:20] festival coming up uh November 2nd
[51:24] uh there be at the Pilot Community
[51:27] Center.
[51:28] And um also um
[51:34] this uh I'll be heading to South I think
[51:37] it's South Carolina. Is that where
[51:39] brother Fred Mullins is? South Carolina.
[51:42] So we'll be head I'll be heading down
[51:44] there. um
[51:46] um Thursday and um be a series of
[51:51] services there. So I won't be here uh
[51:55] Sunday uh but the Lord willing, brother
[51:58] Terry will be ministering here and um so
[52:04] uh we both covet your prayers. Amen. And
[52:07] um I've met brother Fred and actually
[52:10] he's preached for us there at our in our
[52:12] meeting a few years back. Um and so this
[52:16] will be my first time ministering for
[52:18] him and we just pray that we can be a
[52:21] blessing somehow and um u be
[52:26] ministering. Brother Andrew uh Glover,
[52:30] also brother Josh Martin and brother
[52:33] Solomon will be ministering there as
[52:36] well. And so um we really covet your
[52:40] prayers. We can just say something to
[52:42] help and uh we'll be praying here as
[52:45] well for the church and uh believing
[52:49] y'all will have just a wonderful time in
[52:51] the Lord.
[52:53] Also, uh, Brother Wayne called the other
[52:56] day and, um, we had scheduled, uh, for
[53:01] him to come December 5th through the
[53:03] 7th. And, um, he called to let me know
[53:07] that he forgot a special
[53:11] um, event that's going on. uh at that
[53:15] time uh brother Ray uh they're having uh
[53:19] a celebration or birthday uh for him on
[53:25] at that that weekend.
[53:27] And so he's asked uh to us see if we
[53:31] could change the dates to December 19th
[53:34] through the 21st.
[53:36] And so that's going to be the weekend
[53:38] before Christmas. Um, so, uh, I told him
[53:43] I would just talk with the church and,
[53:46] um, how many would be able to come be be
[53:49] here if we had that had it that close?
[53:53] Hands raised real high so we can see how
[53:56] many wouldn't be able to come.
[53:59] Um, for John,
[54:02] I'm gonna have to talk to you. No.
[54:06] And um um
[54:09] I I really he you know um he was
[54:13] supposed to be in um
[54:16] uh Canada
[54:18] um in between those weekends and he
[54:21] canled and um
[54:25] you know he just said I I could come but
[54:28] he then you know it kind of be unfair to
[54:32] the brother Tom Ray and them you know,
[54:36] and uh Brother Wayne's been a good
[54:38] friend, and he would do it if I asked
[54:40] him, but I I don't want to put him in a
[54:43] bind or pressure or anything like that.
[54:46] And so, um we we'll just plan on doing
[54:50] it uh the 19th through the 21st of
[54:54] December. And um uh so if you have told
[54:59] anyone about it, um just let them know
[55:02] the dates have been changed. We're kind
[55:04] of good at that uh this year, changing
[55:07] dates and
[55:09] but uh uh uh anyways, the Lord willing,
[55:14] I'll let him know and we'll uh uh just
[55:18] plan on December 19th through the 21st
[55:21] and believe we'll just have a wonderful
[55:23] time in the Lord. Amen. So, uh, before
[55:28] we go into the word, let's just bow our
[55:30] heads and talk to the author.
[55:34] Amen. Father,
[55:37] I'm so glad that we could call you such
[55:41] because we're your children. We're not
[55:43] strangers. We're not beggars, but we
[55:47] have come to realize, Lord, that were
[55:50] sons and daughters of yours.
[55:54] And Lord, you have asked us to come at
[55:58] your table and to feast upon your
[56:01] goodness and the things that you have
[56:03] prepared for us. And Father, we're just
[56:07] delighted to be able to come.
[56:10] We ask Lord that you would just
[56:13] take the word and portion it out to us,
[56:17] Father. And may we feast off of
[56:20] uh these promises. And I pray, Lord,
[56:24] that you would help me just to get
[56:27] myself out of the way. And Lord, not
[56:30] much of a preacher, but if you could
[56:32] just take the words that we'd say and
[56:35] Father, just put it and plant it into
[56:38] our hearts. And Lord, you know the
[56:40] needs. You know how to to meet every
[56:44] need, Father. And I pray that you would
[56:46] do it. Help us to grow, Father, and
[56:49] become more like you is our prayer. We
[56:52] ask that you'd forgive us of all of our
[56:55] sins and our failures, Lord. We give
[56:59] this service into your hands in Jesus
[57:03] Christ's name.
[57:05] Amen.
[57:06] Praise the Lord. So, if you would like
[57:10] to look with me um there in Deuteronomy
[57:16] and uh the 26th
[57:19] chapter and I'd like to start at the
[57:23] 16th verse.
[57:27] Says, "This day the Lord thy God hath
[57:30] commanded thee to do these statutes and
[57:33] judgments.
[57:35] Thou shalt therefore keep and do them
[57:38] with all thine heart, and with all thy
[57:41] soul.
[57:42] Thou hast devouched the Lord this day to
[57:47] be thy God,
[57:49] and to walk in his ways, and to keep his
[57:52] statutes, and his commandments, and his
[57:55] judgments, and hearken unto his voice.
[57:58] And the Lord hath advanced thee this day
[58:02] to be his peculiar people, as he hath
[58:05] promised thee,
[58:08] and that thou shouldest keep all his
[58:11] commandments,
[58:12] and to make thee high above all nations,
[58:16] which he hath made
[58:19] in praise,
[58:20] and in name, and in honor, and that thou
[58:24] mayest be an holy people unto the Lord
[58:28] thy God as he has spoken. Amen. You can
[58:33] have your seats this morning.
[58:37] And use the title holiness, a people
[58:40] separated unto the Lord. And what I I
[58:44] guess what I have to say is things you
[58:47] already know. And so I don't mean to
[58:51] sound reputious,
[58:53] but um I do know that Satan is a liar.
[58:58] Yeah,
[58:59] &gt;&gt; he's the father of lies and he's
[59:00] constantly speaking to us in one form or
[59:05] another and trying to
[59:09] convince us that we're not God's
[59:12] children and that we're not different
[59:15] from the world and and and these things.
[59:19] And so
[59:21] uh maybe just to
[59:24] keep us in remembrance of who we are,
[59:27] &gt;&gt; right?
[59:29] But all throughout the Bible, um God has
[59:33] has
[59:35] separated um you know, the prophet has
[59:38] told us uh several times that God is a
[59:41] segregationist, not necessarily not in
[59:44] race, but he's a segregationist
[59:49] uh when it comes to the world or to the
[59:52] the things of the world.
[59:54] In his dealings with Israel, he
[59:57] commanded them not to mingle with other
[1:00:00] nations. Israel, he dealt with Israel as
[1:00:04] a natural nation. And he tells them,
[1:00:06] don't don't mingle with the other
[1:00:09] nations. They were not to take on uh the
[1:00:12] habits of the of other nations. They
[1:00:15] were not to uh worship as
[1:00:20] in the way that other nations worshiped.
[1:00:23] Their sacrifices and altars
[1:00:26] uh were to be different uh from the
[1:00:30] other nations. um their their Sabbaths,
[1:00:34] their feasts were to be holy and even to
[1:00:39] their diet of what they ate was to be
[1:00:42] different from other nations as we see
[1:00:45] there in in um when Israel was taken
[1:00:50] away captive in Babylon and and um
[1:00:55] Nebuchadnezzar, you know, ordered that
[1:00:59] um Daniel and the the the the his three
[1:01:03] friends, the Hebrew children as we would
[1:01:05] call them, uh they they were to eat the
[1:01:08] same uh the king's meat and and such and
[1:01:12] and they said, "No, we're not doing
[1:01:14] that." And and so there there there was
[1:01:17] a difference in in what they ate and and
[1:01:20] these things. There was just things that
[1:01:22] they were to refuse.
[1:01:24] And so um um also uh when and them in
[1:01:30] captivity, we know that they refused to
[1:01:33] bow down to idols. They they remembered
[1:01:37] who they were and they kept themselves
[1:01:39] separated.
[1:01:41] Uh they they would not offer prayers to
[1:01:44] any other god uh but Jehovah. And we
[1:01:48] find even that throughout the Bible, God
[1:01:50] has separated his prophets from the
[1:01:53] false prophets uh uh by vindicating
[1:01:57] them. And God provided Israel to make a
[1:02:01] difference uh uh between Israel and and
[1:02:05] and and Egypt. He provided or and other
[1:02:08] nations. He provided to them an
[1:02:10] atonement uh which separated them from
[1:02:14] their sins
[1:02:16] uh there. And so we we find that God was
[1:02:20] constantly separating his people. Uh he
[1:02:23] separated them from the enemy as when
[1:02:26] Pharaoh went after the children of
[1:02:28] Israel to destroy them. Uh the Bible
[1:02:31] says there in in uh Exodus uh 14 and 19
[1:02:37] says, "And the angel uh of God which
[1:02:40] went before the camp of Israel removed
[1:02:43] and went behind them and the pillar of
[1:02:46] the cloud went from before their face
[1:02:49] and stood behind them. And it came
[1:02:52] between the camp of of the Egyptians and
[1:02:56] the camp of Israel. And it was a cloud
[1:03:00] and darkness to them to the Egyptians,
[1:03:02] but it gave light by night to to these
[1:03:05] the is Israelites so that no one or or
[1:03:09] so that the one came not near the other
[1:03:12] all the night. Amen. What? So God would
[1:03:16] would would separate even Israel from
[1:03:19] their enemy as they're in in the will of
[1:03:23] God. And and I I I thought of of of how
[1:03:27] important that is to you and I uh that
[1:03:30] God is still separating us uh from from
[1:03:34] the enemy. He's he's he's not letting
[1:03:37] the devil destroy us. He's not letting
[1:03:39] the devil conquer us.
[1:03:41] &gt;&gt; And and and we should really be thankful
[1:03:43] for that.
[1:03:44] &gt;&gt; It ain't it ain't by our might. It ain't
[1:03:47] our own will. It's just God. Amen.
[1:03:51] keeping us the enemy away from us. Amen.
[1:03:55] So we we find also that in the the New
[1:03:58] Testament that God foretold of uh a
[1:04:02] separation that would come uh remember
[1:04:05] the wheat and the tears. They they they
[1:04:07] were planted in the same field which it
[1:04:09] was the world and and and uh they grew
[1:04:13] up together and and then God says there
[1:04:16] come a time that when they ripened then
[1:04:19] time of harvest that there would be a
[1:04:21] separation. God separating the the the
[1:04:25] wheat from the tears. He also foretold
[1:04:28] that uh there would be a cry that would
[1:04:32] come forth. Come out of her my people.
[1:04:35] At this time of separation, a cry would
[1:04:38] come, come out of her.
[1:04:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. And so I believe that this is
[1:04:44] being fulfilled today. Amen. That there
[1:04:48] is a separation there and and God is
[1:04:51] making the difference clear between the
[1:04:54] two. Uh we find that the prophet taught
[1:04:58] us that God is sealing his elect today
[1:05:02] and Satan is sealing his people uh as
[1:05:07] well. And and brother Brandham
[1:05:10] in his prayer, he said, "We realize that
[1:05:14] that must come to that place that the
[1:05:18] chaff and the wheat must be separated.
[1:05:20] And we know that this is a separating
[1:05:24] time when the world will continue to
[1:05:27] grow worse. But the church will become
[1:05:30] more concerned and your spirit will get
[1:05:33] greater and more powerful all the time
[1:05:36] in the church till Christ and the church
[1:05:40] unites together. Can you say amen? So we
[1:05:43] see that there are two things happening.
[1:05:46] The world getting more carnal. The world
[1:05:48] getting more worldly. the world getting
[1:05:50] more gospel hardened and yet the church
[1:05:54] is becoming more interested in the
[1:05:57] things of God, becoming more uh uh
[1:06:01] concerned
[1:06:02] and the spirit of God becoming greater
[1:06:05] and more powerful in the church until
[1:06:08] Christ and the church become one
[1:06:10] together.
[1:06:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. And so there is a a people that is
[1:06:17] going in the rapture. How many believes
[1:06:19] that?
[1:06:20] &gt;&gt; And yet there is a people that's going
[1:06:23] in a tribulation. There is a people that
[1:06:27] is going to be caught up, amen, into
[1:06:30] another dimension. And they're going to
[1:06:33] live forever and ever. And at the same
[1:06:37] time, there will be a people on this
[1:06:39] earth continuing to age, continue to get
[1:06:43] older. Amen. To continue getting worse
[1:06:46] and worse. Amen. And and and they're
[1:06:49] going through the tribulation. Ain't
[1:06:51] that right?
[1:06:52] &gt;&gt; Those that go in the rapture are going
[1:06:55] to be part of that first resurrection.
[1:06:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. Uh which is to take place before
[1:07:02] the tribulation uh sets in and the rest
[1:07:06] will go in in the second resurrection.
[1:07:10] And um uh the Bible says the dead live
[1:07:13] not the rest of the dead live not for
[1:07:16] thousand years. Ain't that right?
[1:07:18] &gt;&gt; So, so then that rap group uh uh will be
[1:07:23] sitting on the throne at the white
[1:07:26] throne judgment. Amen. They will be
[1:07:28] giving the judgment. That's the bride.
[1:07:30] The others will be standing before amen
[1:07:34] the throne and being judged. Amen. And
[1:07:39] the prophet said about it, he he said,
[1:07:41] "Woe unto them, you know, that that that
[1:07:44] are left behind then." Amen. And he
[1:07:47] says, you know, God, let don't let me
[1:07:50] stand before that day. That that throne
[1:07:52] judgment, let me be flayed alive. Let
[1:07:55] let them open my belly up and pour
[1:07:57] suleric acid in it. And he's he's trying
[1:08:01] to describe the worst things that could
[1:08:03] happen to an individual. He said, "But
[1:08:05] let let that happen, but don't don't let
[1:08:07] me stand before the white throne
[1:08:10] judgment." Amen. So, it's going to be a
[1:08:12] time of uh of of of a great time. Amen.
[1:08:18] But there'll be two peoples um uh uh
[1:08:21] separated God separating. Can you say
[1:08:24] amen? You may be going through trials
[1:08:26] now. Amen. But thank God that you're
[1:08:29] part of the bride. You you may be going
[1:08:31] through things now, but it ain't nothing
[1:08:34] compared to what uh the rest of the
[1:08:36] world's going to go through. Amen.
[1:08:38] Because you've got an a promise that
[1:08:41] you'll hear, "Well done, thou good and
[1:08:43] faithful servant." Amen. You pressing
[1:08:46] and and you're you're pushing and you're
[1:08:49] forsaking the world and you're clinging
[1:08:51] to God and you're keeping your garments
[1:08:53] undefiled. Amen. Uh but there comes a
[1:08:57] reward with that. Can you say amen?
[1:09:00] &gt;&gt; A brother
[1:09:02] told of how that he and his family went
[1:09:04] and down into a cavern. A guide had
[1:09:07] taken them and some other people. And so
[1:09:10] as they were on their way down uh uh in
[1:09:14] into this hole or cave, whatever. Uh uh
[1:09:19] the guy told them, says, "Now down
[1:09:20] there, he said there's a room where
[1:09:22] everybody looks the same." And so this
[1:09:25] brother said, "Well, this is going to be
[1:09:26] interesting. I like to see that, you
[1:09:28] know. So, they get down there and then
[1:09:30] the guy turns out the light and he says,
[1:09:33] "See, we're all the same." And the
[1:09:36] brother says, "Well, you couldn't see
[1:09:37] even see your hand before you, you
[1:09:40] know." And then he flips the light on
[1:09:42] and the light showed that they weren't
[1:09:44] all the same. And I thought, "Well, how
[1:09:46] how that is in in in in the world
[1:09:51] today." Amen. Because there there are
[1:09:55] people that walk in darkness. They're
[1:09:58] living in darkness. And and and and they
[1:10:01] tell us everybody's the same. There's no
[1:10:04] difference. It it's all the same. But if
[1:10:07] you're walking in the light of the word,
[1:10:10] then you realize, no, not everybody is
[1:10:13] the same.
[1:10:14] &gt;&gt; We're different. Can you say amen? Amen.
[1:10:17] And we're not to conform, Amen. into the
[1:10:20] world and be like the world and dress
[1:10:23] like the world and act like the world
[1:10:26] and and all of these things. We're
[1:10:28] different. How many believes you're
[1:10:29] different?
[1:10:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. We're different. And so uh we find
[1:10:33] that the Bible is full of people uh that
[1:10:36] God has placed in there to be more
[1:10:39] memorials for us. whether it's it's to
[1:10:42] look at their lives to be encouraged by
[1:10:44] and and and to to uh conform to or uh uh
[1:10:50] to look at and to shun and say, "No,
[1:10:52] that's but but yet they're memorials to
[1:10:54] us." And two of these memorials are
[1:10:56] Lot's wife and Abraham's wife, Sarah.
[1:10:59] Amen. And and we we find that, you know,
[1:11:03] Lot's wife, she chose to to live in the
[1:11:07] well-watered plains of Sodom and
[1:11:09] Gomorrah. She, the prophet said, she
[1:11:11] wanted to be sociable. Amen. And with
[1:11:15] everybody. She wanted to live like the
[1:11:17] rest of the women down there. Whereas
[1:11:19] Sarah kept herself separated,
[1:11:23] living in a tent and in the barren land
[1:11:27] and stayed there. But the prophet said
[1:11:30] the difference is Sarah kept the word in
[1:11:34] her heart. She kept the promise in her
[1:11:37] heart. And as because she kept the
[1:11:40] promise in her heart, Sodom and Gomorra
[1:11:43] didn't look appealing because she had a
[1:11:46] promise. Can you say amen? The prophet
[1:11:48] said she was obedient and lovely to her
[1:11:51] husband in so much that she called him
[1:11:54] her Lord. And there's where God came
[1:11:58] down with two angels and visit them in
[1:12:01] the tent. See, so Miss Lot became a a
[1:12:05] very worldly uh uh person and taken up
[1:12:09] with with the things of the world. And
[1:12:12] the prophet says now, he says if we
[1:12:14] don't watch it, we can become worldly
[1:12:18] minded, too.
[1:12:19] &gt;&gt; So, so we got to watch it. We we realize
[1:12:22] that there's a difference here. I am
[1:12:24] bride. How many believes you're bride?
[1:12:26] Amen. I'm bride. Now if if we don't
[1:12:29] watch it, we can become worldly and we
[1:12:32] can actually take on the characteristics
[1:12:34] of Miss Lot. Amen. See, and so he says,
[1:12:38] now maybe Miss Lot didn't mean to do
[1:12:40] that when she went down there. She
[1:12:42] thought, well, I'll just be sociable.
[1:12:44] It's all right to be sociable, but don't
[1:12:47] take up the habits of the world. It's
[1:12:51] okay to be nice and to be kind and and
[1:12:53] and and be polite and say, "How do you
[1:12:56] do?" Amen. But don't take up with the
[1:12:59] things of the world. Amen. He said,
[1:13:01] "When you go, go like Shadrach, Meack,
[1:13:05] and Abedneo and Daniel." They purposed
[1:13:08] in their heart that they would not
[1:13:11] defile themselves. No matter what came
[1:13:14] or what went, see, no matter whether the
[1:13:16] rest of the church backslid or what
[1:13:19] happened, they purposed in their heart.
[1:13:22] Can you say amen? So when we go out
[1:13:25] these doors and we go to school, we go
[1:13:27] on our jobs, we go to the the
[1:13:29] supermarket and and and uh uh and and
[1:13:33] all these things, we must go with a
[1:13:35] purpose in our heart. Amen. That as I've
[1:13:39] got to do these things, I am a child of
[1:13:42] God. Can you say amen?
[1:13:44] &gt;&gt; That's right. So we are a holy people. A
[1:13:48] man that is called to show forth the
[1:13:50] praises of him. Amen. Who has called us.
[1:13:54] Amen. Now we as we said and we know that
[1:13:57] the world is under an influence. Amen.
[1:14:00] This influence is the power of Satan.
[1:14:03] And and Satan Satan only has the power
[1:14:08] to deform, not transform.
[1:14:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. He He only has the power to
[1:14:13] deform. And we we've read it. But the
[1:14:16] the the meaning of deform means to
[1:14:19] alter. and and and uh to alter the
[1:14:22] natural form or to misshape to
[1:14:26] disfigure. Amen. See, and and and so
[1:14:29] anything that is deformed is is taken
[1:14:32] from its original state. Amen. It once
[1:14:35] was this originally, but now it's this
[1:14:38] by the power of deformation. It's it's
[1:14:42] deformed and and all of these things. It
[1:14:45] and and the prophet said it becomes
[1:14:47] perverted. uh which means changed over
[1:14:50] made something different than what its
[1:14:53] original uh uh uh creation was. So then
[1:14:58] we could say that the drunkard, the the
[1:15:00] prostitute, the the religious sinner has
[1:15:04] been deformed by Satan's power. Ain't
[1:15:08] that right? And and we know that Satan's
[1:15:11] power of of uh to deform it it it it it
[1:15:16] doesn't just apply to the soul, but it
[1:15:18] applies to the body and and the mental
[1:15:20] and it causes limbs to be twisted up. It
[1:15:24] causes the eyes to not see. It causes
[1:15:26] the legs not to walk. It it it it
[1:15:29] causes, you know, deafness and all these
[1:15:33] things. Ain't that right? That's in the
[1:15:35] physical realm. But but then the soul is
[1:15:37] so twisted up under Satan's uh power of
[1:15:42] deformationation, see that people can't
[1:15:45] believe the word and and and they can't
[1:15:47] get delivered from things and because
[1:15:50] they're under an influence. Whereas the
[1:15:53] believer is under an influence that
[1:15:56] comes from God. And God's influence is
[1:16:00] the power of transformation.
[1:16:02] That's why you you stay under the
[1:16:04] influence of the word. Never never go
[1:16:07] into another influence. Don't allow
[1:16:09] yourself to come under another
[1:16:12] influence. Amen. That u uh there there's
[1:16:16] real spirits out here, right? Amen. I
[1:16:19] mean, they're genuine spirits. Amen.
[1:16:22] That are out there. But uh uh but God's
[1:16:25] power is real. Amen. So to transform it
[1:16:29] means to change in composition or
[1:16:32] structure or to change the outward form
[1:16:36] or appearance of to change in character
[1:16:39] or condition to convert. As we all know
[1:16:43] we were all at one time under Satan's
[1:16:45] deforming power. We were affected by it.
[1:16:48] uh uh what we were supposed to be and
[1:16:52] what we came out to be in our birth are
[1:16:56] two different things. What we were
[1:16:59] supposed to be is what God predestinated
[1:17:03] us to be. What we were is the results of
[1:17:07] Satan's deforming power. We were born
[1:17:10] with a carnal mind, carnal nature, an
[1:17:13] enemy to God. Did not know God. didn't
[1:17:17] understand his ways. Um we as the Bible
[1:17:21] says we were we walked in darkness
[1:17:24] without understanding and all these
[1:17:26] things. Did not know his word. We only
[1:17:29] had a carnal understanding. Ain't that
[1:17:31] right? The book was sealed up. Everybody
[1:17:36] say the book was sealed up. Uh it was
[1:17:40] forfeited in the beginning. Can you say
[1:17:43] amen? And I'd like to talk about that.
[1:17:47] See, see, Satan by his p his deforming
[1:17:50] power took us from our position.
[1:17:55] &gt;&gt; You believe that?
[1:17:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. Took us from our position. Man was
[1:18:00] made in the image of God. He was made to
[1:18:03] have dominion. He had dominion. Amen.
[1:18:06] Over the earth and everything in the
[1:18:08] earth. His authority was God's authority
[1:18:12] working through him.
[1:18:15] &gt;&gt; God made man for a chic channel, right?
[1:18:18] Amen. That's all we are is we're
[1:18:20] channels. Amen. You and and the prophet
[1:18:23] talked about it. You know how that uh
[1:18:25] there's an influence from above, there's
[1:18:27] an influence from beneath. Amen. There's
[1:18:30] them two powers. We're sitting here in
[1:18:32] the mortal realm in between. And these
[1:18:36] two influences uh influence every more m
[1:18:39] mortal person. Every mortal person in
[1:18:43] this realm of of mortality is influenced
[1:18:47] by either the influence from above or
[1:18:49] the underneath world. Amen. See, so so
[1:18:53] we find that God made man to be a
[1:18:56] channel. And and and a channel is
[1:18:59] something by which a thing is made
[1:19:03] known.
[1:19:04] A channel is something by which a a
[1:19:08] thing is made known. There are voices in
[1:19:11] the room. There are pictures in this
[1:19:14] room and they have been here since the
[1:19:17] beginning of time. Amen. But it's been
[1:19:21] only in the past uh hundred years or
[1:19:25] whatever or less or something to that
[1:19:27] effect that that man has developed
[1:19:31] channels
[1:19:33] &gt;&gt; which allows the voices to to be made
[1:19:38] known by radio. Ain't that right? it.
[1:19:41] He's he's come up with an instrument a
[1:19:43] channels it channels by which pictures
[1:19:48] can be uh made known. It's a the channel
[1:19:52] through and I I don't understand it all
[1:19:55] but but you know I looked up channel it
[1:19:58] it's a band of frequencies of sufficient
[1:20:01] width for a single radio or television
[1:20:05] communication. See, and and so we are we
[1:20:08] we if we get the right channel, we can
[1:20:11] hear voices in the room. If we get the
[1:20:14] right channel, there can be pictures
[1:20:16] here and we can see them uh uh there. So
[1:20:20] man was made to be a channel. Do you
[1:20:23] believe that man was made to be a
[1:20:25] channel? God works through man and
[1:20:29] unfortunately Satan works through the
[1:20:32] same channel. Amen. and see. So, uh uh
[1:20:36] have you have you just listened to like
[1:20:39] the AM station and uh radio station and
[1:20:44] you can be driving and you get so far
[1:20:47] out uh maybe and all of a sudden you're
[1:20:51] listening to something and then another
[1:20:53] frequency starts another voices or
[1:20:55] another um uh music starts coming in at
[1:20:59] the same time and you're trying to
[1:21:01] listen to this and maybe uh uh or you're
[1:21:04] listening to a a a talk show or whatever
[1:21:07] and you'll hear rock and roll coming in.
[1:21:09] You're like, "Where's that coming from?"
[1:21:10] It it it it two things coming in to the
[1:21:14] same frequency. See? And and and so it
[1:21:18] shows there's a weak channel. Amen. It
[1:21:20] it's something weak and and and things
[1:21:23] are filtering in. It's not a dedicated
[1:21:26] channel like it should be or or you're
[1:21:28] going out away from the the tower. Amen.
[1:21:32] to where it could send strong signals
[1:21:34] and and you're in between to where both
[1:21:37] signals are coming into one channel,
[1:21:39] right? Well, God doesn't want to Satan's
[1:21:43] power and his power working through you.
[1:21:46] It only causes confusion. Amen. He's
[1:21:49] trying to send a voice of this and
[1:21:51] Satan's sending a voice of this and
[1:21:53] you're just being a channel and anyone
[1:21:55] that's hearing you, anyone that is
[1:21:57] seeing you, it's causing confusion. I
[1:22:00] thought he was supposed to be a
[1:22:01] Christian and look what he's doing. I
[1:22:02] thought he was supposed to be this. I
[1:22:04] thought she was supposed to be this and
[1:22:05] and now I'm seeing this and and and it's
[1:22:08] just a constant uh there. But God made
[1:22:12] man a man to be a channel. Now I I will
[1:22:16] say because the prophet taught us
[1:22:18] neither God nor Satan can force
[1:22:22] themselves upon us.
[1:22:25] &gt;&gt; You were right. Amen.
[1:22:27] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:22:28] &gt;&gt; So how this channel works is man must
[1:22:31] surrender himself to either God his
[1:22:36] power or we or surrender himself to
[1:22:39] Satan's power and and and whatever the
[1:22:43] man, woman, boy, girl surrenders to,
[1:22:47] that's what becomes more prominent in
[1:22:50] their lives. Amen. That's that's right.
[1:22:54] Hell has been made manifest through
[1:22:58] channels because people have surrendered
[1:23:01] themselves to it. But yet God, we see
[1:23:04] through a prophet that that God was was
[1:23:08] able to make himself known as the same
[1:23:11] yesterday, today, and forever through a
[1:23:13] channel. He had one man that he that
[1:23:16] would be a channel that would surrender
[1:23:18] himself. Amen. And God could make
[1:23:22] himself known to where people thought it
[1:23:24] was Jesus Christ in flesh. Can you say
[1:23:28] amen? Amen. Well, it ain't just benom.
[1:23:33] We are all called to be channels for
[1:23:35] God.
[1:23:37] &gt;&gt; That's right. If if Satan is able to
[1:23:40] manifest his power in such a depth of
[1:23:44] darkness to where people behead each
[1:23:47] other and kids kill their parents in
[1:23:49] such a a horrific way and and and it
[1:23:54] seems like the powers are being
[1:23:56] unleashed. Why? Because people are
[1:23:59] surrendering themselves to it. When they
[1:24:02] reject the word, they surrender
[1:24:05] themselves as channels to Satan.
[1:24:09] But if they're doing that, then God is
[1:24:11] still alive. God remains true. He's
[1:24:16] still the same yesterday, today, and
[1:24:18] forever. He did not die when the prophet
[1:24:21] left the scene. There are still
[1:24:24] channels.
[1:24:28] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:24:29] But man must surrender himself to either
[1:24:33] one. Adam had dominion over the whole
[1:24:37] earth
[1:24:39] over all creation including Satan.
[1:24:43] Satan was a creation.
[1:24:46] Satan was cast out of heaven down to the
[1:24:49] earth before the fall of man over what
[1:24:53] he did in heaven. He caused a revolt in
[1:24:55] heaven as we know. And the prophet said,
[1:24:58] "See, there's been a contest going on
[1:25:01] ever since between Satan and God. It
[1:25:05] started in heaven. Satan was kicked out
[1:25:08] of heaven to the earth. Other words, he
[1:25:12] could no longer maintain his position
[1:25:15] that he had on in heaven."
[1:25:18] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:25:20] &gt;&gt; God took him from that position. No
[1:25:23] longer could he do that. And now he was
[1:25:26] cast to the earth. And the prophet said
[1:25:28] he then become an enemy to God's people.
[1:25:32] And since then he's used all of his
[1:25:34] strength and his stratey strategy to
[1:25:37] pull to try to pull God's people across
[1:25:40] the fires or into his fires.
[1:25:44] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:25:45] &gt;&gt; Now,
[1:25:47] Satan had no power over man, right?
[1:25:51] &gt;&gt; Had absolutely no power. Amen. Man
[1:25:55] didn't know what sickness was, didn't
[1:25:58] know what heartache was, didn't know
[1:26:00] what diseases was, to have a broken
[1:26:03] heart, and he didn't know what it was to
[1:26:06] be addicted to something.
[1:26:08] &gt;&gt; He didn't know, you know, uh uh what it
[1:26:11] was to struggle with things as temper
[1:26:15] and hate and bitterness and lust and and
[1:26:18] all. He didn't know any of these things.
[1:26:21] See, all of these things come from
[1:26:23] Satan's power.
[1:26:25] &gt;&gt; But as long as man was in his position
[1:26:29] &gt;&gt; as God of the earth with domain,
[1:26:33] &gt;&gt; Satan couldn't do a thing about it.
[1:26:36] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:26:37] &gt;&gt; See, and and and so but but Satan is a
[1:26:41] shrewd fella,
[1:26:42] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:26:44] &gt;&gt; This is why you must not give him time
[1:26:46] or day. Yeah.
[1:26:48] &gt;&gt; You must not give lend an ear to him.
[1:26:51] &gt;&gt; Must not lend your heart to him.
[1:26:53] &gt;&gt; You must not lend your thoughts to him.
[1:26:56] &gt;&gt; Your meditation to him. Right.
[1:27:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. See, you must not do that because
[1:27:02] anything he says is a lie.
[1:27:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. And so in the garden, he was
[1:27:09] constantly devising a plan to cause man
[1:27:13] to fall
[1:27:15] &gt;&gt; or to leave his position.
[1:27:18] &gt;&gt; If he could get man to leave his
[1:27:20] position, then he could have power over
[1:27:23] man.
[1:27:25] &gt;&gt; He could dominate. Now, we know the
[1:27:27] power of Satan works through unbelief.
[1:27:29] Ain't that right?
[1:27:31] &gt;&gt; Works through unbelief. God's power
[1:27:33] works through faith.
[1:27:37] So as long as man believed in God's
[1:27:39] word, the power of God operated through
[1:27:42] him. He was the channel for God, Amen,
[1:27:45] to work his authority, to work his
[1:27:47] character, to work every in in man as
[1:27:51] long as he believed.
[1:27:54] &gt;&gt; But Satan, of course, was able to speak
[1:27:56] through the serpent
[1:27:58] &gt;&gt; and and and
[1:28:00] convince Eve to surrender herself to
[1:28:03] him. The prophet says anytime a woman
[1:28:06] takes a wrong step, she first has to
[1:28:08] receive it in her mind. Some slicker has
[1:28:12] to persuade her and she listens to it
[1:28:14] against her own better judgment. Then
[1:28:16] the act is committed. See, Satan hit
[1:28:19] Eve's mind.
[1:28:21] &gt;&gt; In the womb of her mind, she doubted
[1:28:23] God's word. Then come the actual act. So
[1:28:26] the act that that ain't that that's just
[1:28:29] something we see. But something been
[1:28:31] going on a long time.
[1:28:33] See, we we think, "Oh, it's sudden. Look
[1:28:35] at them. Look the way they're acting.
[1:28:36] That's sudden." No. Satan been working
[1:28:39] there all the time, and they've been
[1:28:40] entertaining things.
[1:28:43] &gt;&gt; See? And then the action comes forth.
[1:28:46] See? So, so now, Satan couldn't use man
[1:28:50] a as a channel. Uh uh he couldn't get to
[1:28:53] man, right?
[1:28:54] &gt;&gt; It wasn't that was the woman that was
[1:28:57] deceived.
[1:28:58] &gt;&gt; And and so he couldn't get through man
[1:29:00] as the channel. So we walk through woman
[1:29:03] and and and she brought forth a child of
[1:29:05] death of Satan. See, and and so uh uh we
[1:29:10] we find that later on God was able to
[1:29:14] bring forth his son through a woman.
[1:29:17] See, but but I say this, we were
[1:29:20] supposed to come the way Christ came.
[1:29:22] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:29:23] &gt;&gt; You believe that
[1:29:25] &gt;&gt; Adam had the book. He had the rights to
[1:29:28] life.
[1:29:29] &gt;&gt; And every name that was written in the
[1:29:31] book
[1:29:33] &gt;&gt; should have came forth by the spoken
[1:29:35] word of Adam.
[1:29:37] &gt;&gt; Let there be. Remember the prophet said
[1:29:39] Mary said, "A man, done what Eve should
[1:29:42] have done. Be it unto me according to
[1:29:44] thy word." But before Adam got to her,
[1:29:48] Satan got to her and she accepted the
[1:29:51] wrong seed.
[1:29:52] &gt;&gt; That's right, brother.
[1:29:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. Come on now.
[1:29:54] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? So we didn't come
[1:29:57] forth as sons of God.
[1:30:00] &gt;&gt; We came as sons of Adam.
[1:30:04] &gt;&gt; True.
[1:30:06] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:30:08] &gt;&gt; Not word seed, sex seed.
[1:30:12] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:30:14] &gt;&gt; Now the prophet said, see now this is
[1:30:18] how this is how God was able to work
[1:30:20] bring his son into a womb.
[1:30:23] The physical mind of Mary was virgin
[1:30:26] womb. Why? She believed God's word.
[1:30:29] That's right.
[1:30:30] &gt;&gt; No matter how much anybody criticized
[1:30:33] how many things somebody else said, that
[1:30:37] didn't have one thing to do with it.
[1:30:40] &gt;&gt; She believed God's word regardless.
[1:30:43] &gt;&gt; First was her mind. Before the act ever
[1:30:47] taken place in her literal womb, the act
[1:30:50] had to take place in here, first to let
[1:30:53] the the spirit come in to do the rest of
[1:30:57] the work.
[1:30:58] &gt;&gt; He said, "Oh my glory." Before the
[1:31:02] actual spiritual birth can take place,
[1:31:05] the word has to find itself through your
[1:31:09] mind.
[1:31:11] Believe it.
[1:31:13] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Amen.
[1:31:14] &gt;&gt; The word is strong. It's powerful.
[1:31:18] &gt;&gt; But it's got to be received by believing
[1:31:21] it.
[1:31:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:26] &gt;&gt; He that heareth my words and believeth
[1:31:28] on him that sent me hath eternal life
[1:31:30] and shall never come to judgment.
[1:31:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:33] &gt;&gt; See, so that's how God was able to bring
[1:31:36] forth his son in the womb of a virgin is
[1:31:39] she just believed the word. She closed
[1:31:42] out every other thought, every other
[1:31:44] skeptic criticism, everything that Satan
[1:31:47] was trying to tell her that can't
[1:31:48] happen. You're going to be a fanatic.
[1:31:50] You're going to be laughed at. This has
[1:31:52] never been done. She closed all of that
[1:31:54] out and just said, "Be it unto me
[1:31:56] according to thy word."
[1:31:59] &gt;&gt; Eve should have done the same thing.
[1:32:02] &gt;&gt; But she stopped to listen
[1:32:05] &gt;&gt; to what the serpent or Satan had to say.
[1:32:08] Yeah.
[1:32:10] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:32:13] &gt;&gt; When Eve fell, she received the wrong
[1:32:15] seed and she fell. Her countenance
[1:32:18] changed for death was upon her.
[1:32:22] &gt;&gt; Satan's deforming power was already
[1:32:25] working on her. Now, this put Adam in a
[1:32:29] tight spot.
[1:32:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because when she came to him, this
[1:32:35] wasn't just a woman coming. This was
[1:32:38] flesh of his flesh, bone of his bone.
[1:32:41] &gt;&gt; This is a woman that came from him. He
[1:32:44] loved her.
[1:32:46] &gt;&gt; So when she came to him to to get him to
[1:32:50] partake of the what she parttook of that
[1:32:54] put Adam in a tight spot.
[1:32:56] Now he had to make the choice
[1:32:59] &gt;&gt; to to hold on to the book,
[1:33:03] &gt;&gt; keep the book
[1:33:05] &gt;&gt; or to walk away from the book and go
[1:33:08] with his wife.
[1:33:10] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:33:11] &gt;&gt; To forfeit. So, so because Adam loved
[1:33:14] his wife who was a part of him, he chose
[1:33:17] to walk away from his inheritance and
[1:33:21] and and all of these things. and and the
[1:33:25] moment he walked out, he fell and he had
[1:33:28] no power to redeem.
[1:33:33] &gt;&gt; Now, prophet said Adam, Satan caused
[1:33:35] Adam to fall by that one word. And when
[1:33:38] he failed, see now Adam forfeited the
[1:33:41] book.
[1:33:42] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? He forfeited the book.
[1:33:45] That word forfeit means something that
[1:33:48] is lost or given up on account of an
[1:33:52] offense, error or failure to fulfill an
[1:33:55] agreement.
[1:33:56] &gt;&gt; So, Adam failed. Amen. He forfeited it.
[1:34:01] Amen. And and because of an offense or
[1:34:04] an heir, see, and the prophet said, see,
[1:34:07] it was forfeited. Then it couldn't go
[1:34:09] back into the dirty hands of Satan who
[1:34:12] tempted her out of the way. So
[1:34:15] therefore, it went back to its original
[1:34:17] owner, which is God. Like any abstract
[1:34:20] deed would do, goes back right back to
[1:34:23] its original owner. And that was God the
[1:34:26] creator who made it. And he holds it.
[1:34:28] Ain't that right?
[1:34:30] &gt;&gt; Now, we find that he holds it because in
[1:34:32] Revelations 5:1 that it went back to
[1:34:35] him. John saw God sitting on the throne
[1:34:37] holding something in his hand. And he
[1:34:40] says, "And I saw in the right of him
[1:34:42] that sat upon the throne a book written
[1:34:44] within and with and on the backside."
[1:34:47] See, sealed with seven seals. Can you
[1:34:50] say amen?
[1:34:51] &gt;&gt; That's the book
[1:34:53] &gt;&gt; that Adam forfeited.
[1:34:57] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:34:59] &gt;&gt; See, so so what did he lose when he
[1:35:02] forfeited the book? He lost his rights
[1:35:06] of the word. Amen.
[1:35:08] &gt;&gt; The prophet said the right his rights of
[1:35:10] the word, the promises, their
[1:35:13] inheritance,
[1:35:15] &gt;&gt; all in the book.
[1:35:17] &gt;&gt; And when he walked away, he forfeited
[1:35:20] his rights
[1:35:22] &gt;&gt; to the word.
[1:35:24] &gt;&gt; He forfeited the promises.
[1:35:27] &gt;&gt; He forfeited his inheritance.
[1:35:29] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:35:31] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[1:35:33] &gt;&gt; The prophet says, "You remember how it
[1:35:35] was lost by Adam? He forfeited the book
[1:35:38] of life for the knowledge of Satan and
[1:35:39] lost his inheritance. He lost everything
[1:35:42] and no way for redemption.
[1:35:44] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:35:46] &gt;&gt; Another place when man lost his life.
[1:35:50] Capital L, he also lost his inheritance
[1:35:54] in life
[1:35:55] &gt;&gt; because he had complete supreme uh
[1:35:58] control of the earth. He was a god of
[1:36:01] the earth.
[1:36:03] &gt;&gt; God's the God of the universe
[1:36:04] everywhere. But his son had his earth
[1:36:08] under his control.
[1:36:10] &gt;&gt; He could speak. He could name. He could
[1:36:13] say,
[1:36:15] &gt;&gt; he could stop nature.
[1:36:17] &gt;&gt; He could do anything he wanted to.
[1:36:20] &gt;&gt; When he did that, he lost his
[1:36:21] inheritance.
[1:36:23] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? See, now Adam could
[1:36:25] say, see, let let this mountain be moved
[1:36:27] over there, and it would do it. Adam
[1:36:30] could say, "Let this tree be uh here, be
[1:36:32] plucked up and planted over here." it
[1:36:34] would do it. For he had complete supreme
[1:36:37] control as a minor god under God our
[1:36:40] father because he was a son of God.
[1:36:44] &gt;&gt; But when Adam forfeited the book, now
[1:36:48] Satan had power.
[1:36:50] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[1:36:53] &gt;&gt; He took control.
[1:36:56] &gt;&gt; He took over man.
[1:36:59] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[1:37:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. We find that all the kingdoms of
[1:37:04] the earth from from that time all the
[1:37:06] way to now is under Satan's domain.
[1:37:11] &gt;&gt; They're dominated. Every nation is
[1:37:13] dominated by Satan. He's the ruler of
[1:37:17] the earth.
[1:37:18] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[1:37:20] &gt;&gt; Prophet said bloodshed, war, famine,
[1:37:22] sickness, and disease, germs, and sin
[1:37:25] comes from the devil.
[1:37:27] &gt;&gt; Every nation has a national spirit which
[1:37:29] are devils. Those spirits get jealous of
[1:37:33] another spirit. And what do they do?
[1:37:35] They cause war.
[1:37:37] &gt;&gt; This ain't just Russian against United
[1:37:40] States. They're devils.
[1:37:42] &gt;&gt; Spirits that are pitting men against one
[1:37:45] another.
[1:37:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's true.
[1:37:50] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:37:50] &gt;&gt; It's it's it's a prophet looking in the
[1:37:53] spiritual realm.
[1:37:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. in that supernatural world and
[1:37:57] seeing demons at work because demons are
[1:38:00] getting jealous of one another.
[1:38:05] &gt;&gt; And and so we see today that men and
[1:38:07] women and even children are under
[1:38:10] Satan's power. Look at the broken homes.
[1:38:13] Look at the broken marriages, broken
[1:38:15] families, and and all kinds of things.
[1:38:19] So, Brother Bram said, "Adam lost his
[1:38:21] inheritance, the earth. Now it passed
[1:38:23] from his hand to the one he sold it out
[1:38:26] to Satan. He sowed his faith in God to
[1:38:29] Satan's reasonings. Therefore, his
[1:38:32] eternal life, his right to the tree of
[1:38:34] life, his right to the earth belonged to
[1:38:36] him and he forfeited every bit to the
[1:38:39] hands of Satan. He passed it from the
[1:38:41] his hand to Satan. See, and and he says
[1:38:45] it it in return and it it returned and
[1:38:48] and has been polluted and the seed of
[1:38:50] Adam has destroyed the inheritance that
[1:38:53] God that Adam should have had. And
[1:38:55] that's the earth. Ain't that right? And
[1:38:58] we see that Satan's forces are still
[1:39:00] here, his demonic powers and and and and
[1:39:03] all of these things. The prophet said,
[1:39:04] "That's why the earth is now so filthy.
[1:39:06] That's why the scum and ridiculous
[1:39:08] things that go on, bloodshed, war,
[1:39:11] politics, sin, adultery, all kinds of
[1:39:13] filthiness goes on is because that Satan
[1:39:16] is the ruler of this earth and this
[1:39:19] atmosphere.
[1:39:21] &gt;&gt; As I've said, you know that uh quoting a
[1:39:24] prophet, the lid of hell has come off.
[1:39:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. And streams of demon power is
[1:39:29] pouring from everywhere. It's conquered
[1:39:32] the nations. It's conquered politics
[1:39:34] till it's rotten to the core. It's
[1:39:35] conquered the churches until they know
[1:39:37] nothing about denomination. Another
[1:39:39] place the prophet said, "Great dismal
[1:39:42] fogs of unbelief are floating in from
[1:39:45] every side."
[1:39:48] &gt;&gt; There's more sickness.
[1:39:53] &gt;&gt; More insanity,
[1:39:56] &gt;&gt; more diseases, more trouble than ever
[1:39:59] before
[1:40:00] &gt;&gt; because there is more unbelief than ever
[1:40:03] before. That's right.
[1:40:04] &gt;&gt; That's right. That's right.
[1:40:06] &gt;&gt; More adultery is being committed than
[1:40:08] ever before. More homosexualities than
[1:40:11] ex homosexuals than ever before.
[1:40:14] Look at Look at the ministers,
[1:40:17] these bigname ministers in the in the
[1:40:19] secular church nom nominal that are
[1:40:23] falling left and right
[1:40:25] &gt;&gt; this past year
[1:40:28] &gt;&gt; of of adultery.
[1:40:32] one pastor who wasn't who isn't in the
[1:40:34] message. He asked another pastor, a
[1:40:37] friend of his that ain't in the message
[1:40:39] as well, but he he asked him said, "Why
[1:40:41] why are all these these ministers
[1:40:44] falling in adultery?" And his friend,
[1:40:48] one word, he said, "Tlevision."
[1:40:51] &gt;&gt; That's what it is, television. I
[1:40:53] thought, man, if if if a a man from the
[1:40:58] secular world,
[1:40:59] &gt;&gt; church nominal can pinpoint that out,
[1:41:02] &gt;&gt; why can't message folks
[1:41:05] &gt;&gt; pinpoint that out?
[1:41:08] &gt;&gt; But people have become slaves to the
[1:41:10] modern inventions,
[1:41:13] technology, right?
[1:41:15] &gt;&gt; And they've come under an influence that
[1:41:17] has taken them away from the word of
[1:41:19] God.
[1:41:20] &gt;&gt; Now, I I'm not saying that everything is
[1:41:22] bad. We all know the these things come
[1:41:25] from the tree of knowledge of good and
[1:41:27] evil.
[1:41:28] &gt;&gt; So it has its good and it has its evil.
[1:41:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. But I I will say I have never seen
[1:41:34] a time
[1:41:36] &gt;&gt; when men and women are just playing
[1:41:41] around with God.
[1:41:44] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:41:45] &gt;&gt; Uh like like it's no big deal. Claiming
[1:41:47] to be Christians. That's right.
[1:41:49] &gt;&gt; Irreverent in the house of God.
[1:41:51] irreverent towards the things of God and
[1:41:55] they they'll steal even from from the
[1:41:58] house of God. They shoot up places that
[1:42:04] supposed to be for God and and all of
[1:42:07] these things and it it's it's and it's
[1:42:10] getting worse. It's because gross
[1:42:12] darkness is upon them.
[1:42:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:15] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that? We see that this
[1:42:17] lay out a sea and age, it goes into
[1:42:19] chaos.
[1:42:20] And
[1:42:22] so it it's because that when man fell,
[1:42:27] all creation under him fell. All nature
[1:42:32] fell because it was under him. Ain't
[1:42:35] that right?
[1:42:36] &gt;&gt; When Adam fell to death, creation fell
[1:42:39] with him.
[1:42:41] &gt;&gt; And so what we are is a fallen race of
[1:42:44] people. Yeah.
[1:42:47] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:42:48] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[1:42:49] &gt;&gt; By our natural birth, we're just a
[1:42:53] fallen race of people.
[1:42:55] &gt;&gt; No different from the next guy.
[1:42:58] &gt;&gt; No different from whatever.
[1:43:00] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:43:01] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[1:43:03] &gt;&gt; This tells us that when God positionally
[1:43:05] places something, a thing, a person,
[1:43:10] it's for a purpose.
[1:43:11] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:43:12] example, you know, he positioned the
[1:43:15] stars in place. He positioned the sun
[1:43:17] and moon in their place.
[1:43:20] Everything in the sky that God put out
[1:43:23] there in the beginning was positionally
[1:43:26] placed for a reason.
[1:43:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:28] &gt;&gt; Prophet talked, you know, like the
[1:43:29] little dipper and the big dipper. He
[1:43:32] said, you know, each one of those stars
[1:43:33] that make up these things look to only
[1:43:36] be like 2 in apart and yet they're
[1:43:38] million millions of light years apart.
[1:43:41] And he called them the heavenly host,
[1:43:44] God's great army.
[1:43:46] &gt;&gt; You know, it talks of like this zodiac
[1:43:48] that that's made up of of of stars. And
[1:43:51] it begins with the the virgin coming
[1:43:54] over through the cancer age on down
[1:43:56] until the last uh was the lion, Leo, the
[1:43:58] lion, speaking of the first coming of
[1:44:01] Christ by the virgin, the second coming
[1:44:03] by the the lion of the tribe of Judah.
[1:44:07] And and he says, "Not one of them is out
[1:44:09] of place. one keeps its time perfectly.
[1:44:14] &gt;&gt; It says, "I thought of the soldiers uh
[1:44:16] how that if that moon would happen to
[1:44:19] get out of order, the earth would be
[1:44:21] covered again with water in just a few
[1:44:25] minutes." See, the earth would just be
[1:44:28] like it was when God decided to use it
[1:44:31] for to have us here on the earth. It was
[1:44:33] without form, void, and darkness, and
[1:44:35] water was upon the breath of the earth.
[1:44:38] If that moon would ever move, it would
[1:44:41] do the same thing again.
[1:44:43] &gt;&gt; When the moon rocks a little bit away
[1:44:45] from the earth, the tides come up. When
[1:44:47] it goes down, it just follows the the
[1:44:50] tide follows it. See, it's God's great
[1:44:52] army.
[1:44:54] &gt;&gt; And he positioned man on the earth.
[1:44:59] &gt;&gt; He put man in a position as head of of
[1:45:04] the earth. And when man got out of his
[1:45:08] position, it brought chaos to the human
[1:45:11] race.
[1:45:12] &gt;&gt; It brought chaos to the earth. Can you
[1:45:14] say amen?
[1:45:15] &gt;&gt; The only thing that didn't fall was God.
[1:45:18] The prophet said, right?
[1:45:20] &gt;&gt; The only thing that didn't fall, God
[1:45:22] kept his position.
[1:45:25] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:45:26] &gt;&gt; Which means it did not throw his purpose
[1:45:28] into chaos.
[1:45:31] It didn't throw his predestinated will
[1:45:33] into chaos.
[1:45:35] &gt;&gt; It remains intact.
[1:45:38] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:45:40] &gt;&gt; Satan has no control over that.
[1:45:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:45] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[1:45:46] &gt;&gt; And unlike Adam, God had the power to
[1:45:49] come to us and redeem us.
[1:45:52] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Amen.
[1:45:54] &gt;&gt; And according to the law of redemption,
[1:45:57] before God could redeem us, he had to be
[1:46:00] one of us. Ain't that right?
[1:46:05] &gt;&gt; If you look at
[1:46:08] Revelations 5 and one, I'm going to read
[1:46:12] a little bit and I won't keep you long,
[1:46:14] but it says, "And I saw in the right of
[1:46:16] hand of him that sat on the throne a
[1:46:18] book written within and on the backside
[1:46:21] sealed with seven seals. And I saw a
[1:46:23] strong angel proclaiming with a loud
[1:46:25] voice, who is worthy to open the book,
[1:46:27] and to loose the seals thereof.
[1:46:29] No man in heaven, nor in earth, neither
[1:46:32] under the earth, was able to open the
[1:46:34] book, neither to look there upon.
[1:46:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:37] &gt;&gt; And I wept much because no man was found
[1:46:39] worthy to open and to read the book,
[1:46:41] neither to look upon.
[1:46:44] One of the tribe of elders sth unto me,
[1:46:48] weep not. Behold, the lion of the tribe
[1:46:50] of Judah, the root of David, hath
[1:46:52] prevailed to open the book, and to loose
[1:46:54] the seven seals thereof. And I beheld,
[1:46:58] and lo, in the midst of the throne, and
[1:46:59] of the four beasts, and in the midst of
[1:47:01] the elders stood a lamb, as it had been
[1:47:03] slain, having seven horns, seven eyes,
[1:47:07] which are the seven spirits of God, sent
[1:47:09] forth into all the earth. And he came
[1:47:12] and took the book out of the right hand
[1:47:15] of him. Now, that's so important.
[1:47:18] He come and took the book
[1:47:21] &gt;&gt; out of the right hand of him that sat up
[1:47:23] on the throne. And when the when he had
[1:47:26] taken the book only after he had taken
[1:47:29] the book,
[1:47:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. the four beasts and four and 20
[1:47:34] elders fell down before the lamb having
[1:47:37] every one of them harps and golden vials
[1:47:39] full of odors and and which are the
[1:47:42] prayers of the saints. And they sung a
[1:47:43] new song.
[1:47:45] &gt;&gt; When after he took the book,
[1:47:49] &gt;&gt; can you say amen?
[1:47:51] &gt;&gt; After he had loosened
[1:47:53] &gt;&gt; and they and they sung a new song,
[1:47:56] saying, "Thou art worthy to take the
[1:47:58] book, and to open the seals thereof. For
[1:48:01] thou was slain, and hast redeemed us to
[1:48:04] God by thy blood out of every kindred,
[1:48:08] tongue, people, and nation, and has made
[1:48:11] us under our God, kings and priests, and
[1:48:15] we shall reign.
[1:48:17] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? There was a man able
[1:48:20] to take the book.
[1:48:22] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[1:48:24] &gt;&gt; It wasn't just a spirit. It was a man,
[1:48:28] &gt;&gt; a kinsman.
[1:48:31] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[1:48:32] &gt;&gt; And he took the book.
[1:48:34] &gt;&gt; And when he opened the book, it put us
[1:48:38] back in our position.
[1:48:41] Thank you, Lord.
[1:48:43] &gt;&gt; We shall reign on the earth.
[1:48:46] &gt;&gt; You know, they say that the average
[1:48:50] adult has five lers of blood in them,
[1:48:54] which would be 1.3 gallons.
[1:48:58] Now, this earth
[1:49:00] is blood soaked
[1:49:03] with human blood
[1:49:05] &gt;&gt; because of war, accidents, murder, etc.
[1:49:11] All throughout the history of mankind,
[1:49:15] from the time of Abel all the way to
[1:49:18] today,
[1:49:20] blood has been spilled. Human blood has
[1:49:23] been spilled on the ground.
[1:49:26] Now, they say that each year an
[1:49:29] estimated
[1:49:31] 6.8 million people in the US donate
[1:49:34] blood.
[1:49:36] Why do they donate blood?
[1:49:39] to give life to their fellow man.
[1:49:42] &gt;&gt; And we're glad for that, right?
[1:49:46] &gt;&gt; 13.6
[1:49:48] million units of whole blood and red red
[1:49:52] blood cells are collected in the US in a
[1:49:56] year.
[1:49:58] Every two seconds someone is in need of
[1:50:02] blood or platelets.
[1:50:06] Approximately 29,000 units of red blood
[1:50:10] cells are needed daily in the US.
[1:50:15] &gt;&gt; Church, blood matters, don't it? It
[1:50:18] &gt;&gt; does.
[1:50:20] &gt;&gt; Man needs blood.
[1:50:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:23] &gt;&gt; And without the blood, he can't live.
[1:50:28] &gt;&gt; And even amongst our fellow men, we need
[1:50:31] people to give us blood. Amen.
[1:50:34] &gt;&gt; Share your blood so we can live.
[1:50:39] &gt;&gt; And yet, no matter how much blood is
[1:50:42] shed on the ground, no m human blood is
[1:50:46] donated to help others, no ounce of
[1:50:49] human blood has redeeming power.
[1:50:53] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:50:56] &gt;&gt; There's not one spot of Jewish blood in
[1:50:59] Jesus. Right?
[1:51:01] &gt;&gt; And there wasn't a spot of Gentile blood
[1:51:04] in Jesus.
[1:51:06] &gt;&gt; For he was neither gentile or Jew. A lot
[1:51:10] of people say he was a Jew. The prophet
[1:51:12] said he wasn't. He couldn't have been a
[1:51:13] Jew if he was virgin born.
[1:51:17] &gt;&gt; For the blood comes from the male.
[1:51:20] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:51:22] See, so God created a blood cell
[1:51:26] &gt;&gt; in the womb of Mary which developed into
[1:51:31] the son of God. He would create a blood
[1:51:34] cell of his own
[1:51:37] that he could bring forth a kinsman
[1:51:40] redeemer.
[1:51:42] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:51:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:51:43] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Couldn't be from a sex
[1:51:46] birth,
[1:51:47] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:51:47] &gt;&gt; Had to be created. So the birth of
[1:51:50] Christ was a created birth.
[1:51:54] &gt;&gt; You believe it?
[1:51:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:56] &gt;&gt; And the blood that was in him was a
[1:51:58] created blood.
[1:52:00] &gt;&gt; So this is why the Bible says God
[1:52:02] purchased us with his own blood.
[1:52:06] &gt;&gt; God came up with his own blood.
[1:52:08] &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad he's a creator?
[1:52:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. He He could create his own blood.
[1:52:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:15] &gt;&gt; That's the only way you could be
[1:52:16] redeemed.
[1:52:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's the only way we could come
[1:52:19] forth back into our position
[1:52:21] &gt;&gt; is God had to do it himself.
[1:52:24] &gt;&gt; God showing that he never left his
[1:52:26] position. Not one time. He had the power
[1:52:30] when there was no other blood that man
[1:52:32] could have to redeem. He says, "I'll
[1:52:35] create it."
[1:52:36] &gt;&gt; And he found a virgin that would just
[1:52:39] take him at his word.
[1:52:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:52:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. It says he sanctified the people
[1:52:48] with his own blood.
[1:52:50] &gt;&gt; By his own blood, he entered in once
[1:52:53] into the holy place, having obtained
[1:52:55] eternal redemption for us. Revelations
[1:52:59] 15, unto him that loved us and washed us
[1:53:02] or loosed us from our sins in his own
[1:53:07] blood.
[1:53:08] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:53:11] I don't know how much of his blood was
[1:53:14] shed that day at Calvary.
[1:53:22] But I do know this,
[1:53:24] just one drop
[1:53:27] of his blood
[1:53:29] was powerful enough to redeem us.
[1:53:34] Prophet said one drop of the blood of
[1:53:37] Jesus Christ can lift every sinner there
[1:53:39] is out of the miry clay.
[1:53:41] &gt;&gt; Think about it.
[1:53:43] &gt;&gt; One drop can take a prostitute off the
[1:53:47] street and make a saint of God out of
[1:53:49] her.
[1:53:50] &gt;&gt; It can take a drunkard out of the gutter
[1:53:52] and make him a preacher of the gospel.
[1:53:54] One drop can set every hospital patient
[1:53:57] free from sickness.
[1:53:59] It can close every jail and
[1:54:01] penitentiary.
[1:54:03] One drop can deliver every insane
[1:54:06] institution of its diseased and
[1:54:09] afflicted afflicted people. Can you say
[1:54:11] amen?
[1:54:12] &gt;&gt; It had enough power to resurrect the Old
[1:54:15] Testament saints.
[1:54:17] &gt;&gt; Take them out of paradise and take him
[1:54:20] take them uh with him. It has enough
[1:54:23] power. One drop has enough power to sign
[1:54:25] our pardon. It has enough power not only
[1:54:28] to redeem our soul and this whole body,
[1:54:31] but it has enough power to redeem the
[1:54:33] earth.
[1:54:36] &gt;&gt; It had enough power to divorce you from
[1:54:38] your sins. For as the psalmist says in
[1:54:41] 103:12,
[1:54:43] "As far as the east is from the west, so
[1:54:46] far hath he removed our transgressions
[1:54:49] from us. And I say unto you, every name
[1:54:52] that is written in the book shall be
[1:54:56] delivered.
[1:54:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:55:00] &gt;&gt; You believe it?
[1:55:02] &gt;&gt; Someone asked Brother Brandham a
[1:55:03] question. Do Christians sin? He said,
[1:55:06] absolutely no. There is no scripture
[1:55:08] where a Christian sins. He cannot sin.
[1:55:11] &gt;&gt; I know there's a resentment to that.
[1:55:13] Well, we'll just go to he says 1 John 3
[1:55:16] and see what the scripture says. But he
[1:55:18] says, "A Christian does not sin." He
[1:55:21] said, "Did you ever see a black white
[1:55:24] bird or a white black bird? Did you ever
[1:55:26] see a drunk sober man? Did you ever see
[1:55:29] a sinner saint?" He said, "You never did
[1:55:32] see one of those. There's no such a
[1:55:34] thing." Can you say, "Amen." And Jesus
[1:55:36] would tell us, "He that the son is set
[1:55:38] free is free indeed."
[1:55:42] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:55:42] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that?
[1:55:44] The world
[1:55:47] needs to know the power of the blood.
[1:55:51] &gt;&gt; And I believe it's it's it is essential
[1:55:55] for us to know and understand that we
[1:55:58] belong to the Lord.
[1:56:00] This is what Paul would tell us there in
[1:56:02] 1 Corinthians 6:19.
[1:56:05] What know ye that not that your body is
[1:56:07] the temple of the Holy Ghost which is in
[1:56:09] you? Which you have of God? You're not
[1:56:12] of you're not your own. For you are
[1:56:14] bought with the price. Therefore,
[1:56:16] glorify God in your body and in your
[1:56:18] spirit which are God's. In other words,
[1:56:19] he's brought us back to where we can be
[1:56:22] a channel, a dedicated channel for his
[1:56:25] glory.
[1:56:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:28] &gt;&gt; As the prophet said, in God's sight, we
[1:56:30] are greater than his blood
[1:56:33] &gt;&gt; because we are the purchased of the
[1:56:35] blood. And God gives every believer the
[1:56:39] seal of circumcision.
[1:56:41] which is the Holy Ghost as a sign that
[1:56:44] he has recognized them.
[1:56:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. Having the Holy Ghost is not a
[1:56:49] myth. It's it's not just something that
[1:56:51] anyone can say they have. I mean,
[1:56:54] millions of people now that are claiming
[1:56:56] they've got it and they really ain't got
[1:56:58] it.
[1:56:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. But when God gives you the Holy
[1:57:02] Ghost, that is a genuine seal that God
[1:57:06] has recognized you.
[1:57:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. He has brought you to a place that
[1:57:12] you can be a channel for him to use.
[1:57:18] &gt;&gt; Everybody else is being more leosya
[1:57:21] lukewarm and indifferent to the gospel.
[1:57:24] But this bride is staying true to the
[1:57:26] gospel. She's separated from it all and
[1:57:30] dedicated channel.
[1:57:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:32] &gt;&gt; You see, when God gives a man the Holy
[1:57:35] Ghost, God then takes possession. And
[1:57:39] remember the prophet said before God can
[1:57:41] come down in the person of the Holy
[1:57:43] Ghost which is Christ coming down and
[1:57:46] dwelling in the human heart it first
[1:57:48] must be repented.
[1:57:50] &gt;&gt; And and repent means to turn from
[1:57:54] &gt;&gt; right.
[1:57:56] &gt;&gt; We're not talking about failures and
[1:57:57] mistakes. I'm talking about real
[1:57:59] repentance.
[1:58:02] &gt;&gt; I'm talking about you come to the place
[1:58:04] you're not playing with God.
[1:58:06] &gt;&gt; You're not playing church.
[1:58:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:12] He says, "Then it must be baptized in
[1:58:15] his name to show who it belongs to. Then
[1:58:18] it must be cleansed by the blood of
[1:58:20] Jesus. Then the holy fire and Holy Ghost
[1:58:24] from God comes down and burns out all
[1:58:27] the desire of sin."
[1:58:30] &gt;&gt; Are you with me now?
[1:58:32] &gt;&gt; It burns out all the desire of sin. All
[1:58:35] the nature of the world.
[1:58:38] That's right.
[1:58:39] &gt;&gt; Now, the prophet says, "Therefore, he
[1:58:41] that sins willfully after having
[1:58:42] received the knowledge of truth." He
[1:58:44] said, "Then the Bible again says it's
[1:58:46] impossible." It's impossible for a man
[1:58:49] filled with the Holy Ghost to go.
[1:58:51] &gt;&gt; I'm I'm just telling you what a prophet
[1:58:53] said.
[1:58:54] &gt;&gt; See, amen. A man that's born of God
[1:58:57] cannot sin. He does not sin. Hello,
[1:59:00] church.
[1:59:01] &gt;&gt; And and I'll say this for you people
[1:59:03] that are really trying to serve God.
[1:59:06] It's not sin. When you make a mistake,
[1:59:08] &gt;&gt; Brother Brown says, "Because the first
[1:59:10] time you realize that you're wrong, you
[1:59:12] repent of it. You don't have to tell
[1:59:15] somebody or wait till somebody brings it
[1:59:17] out and said, "You've done this, you've
[1:59:18] done that. Oh, oh, I I I'm sorry, folks.
[1:59:21] I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry." Amen.
[1:59:24] You're just only repenting because you
[1:59:25] you got caught.
[1:59:28] &gt;&gt; There should be something inside every
[1:59:30] Christian. Amen. that the moment you you
[1:59:32] realize that you done it, there's
[1:59:34] something that convicts you to say, "I
[1:59:36] was wrong."
[1:59:38] &gt;&gt; Brother Brown said, "You'll say that all
[1:59:40] your life, you'll make mistakes. It
[1:59:42] ain't sin yet."
[1:59:44] &gt;&gt; Because he said, "The moment you realize
[1:59:46] that you done it, you'll repent of it."
[1:59:48] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:59:50] &gt;&gt; So, it's impossible, Amen, for a man
[1:59:52] that's born of God to sin. He does not
[1:59:55] sin. There's no way for him to sin. How
[1:59:57] can he be a sinner and redeemed at the
[2:00:00] same time? So God did not save you, fill
[2:00:02] you with the Holy Ghost to keep you
[2:00:04] going back and forth pawn pawn shop, out
[2:00:06] of the pawn shop, in the pawn shop, out
[2:00:08] of the P. Get away from that mental
[2:00:10] mental belief.
[2:00:12] &gt;&gt; There ain't no way you can be in the
[2:00:14] pawn shop, out of the pawn shop, in the
[2:00:16] pawn shop, out of the pawn shop. You
[2:00:18] have been set free indeed.
[2:00:22] Brother Brown said, "If it's perfect
[2:00:23] blood that's loosed you, then it's a
[2:00:25] perfect loosening."
[2:00:29] &gt;&gt; So if you still got desires and you
[2:00:31] still playing around with God, being
[2:00:33] irreverent in the house of God, you need
[2:00:36] the Holy Ghost.
[2:00:37] &gt;&gt; That's just plain and simple.
[2:00:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:42] &gt;&gt; Just get the Holy Ghost. Quit playing
[2:00:44] around with God, man.
[2:00:48] So it says, "How can he be a sinner and
[2:00:50] redeemed at the same time?" How can I be
[2:00:52] in the pawn shop and out of the pawn
[2:00:53] shop at the same time? He redeemed us by
[2:00:56] his blood by his spirit. He cleansed us.
[2:00:59] Then he comes and dwells in us,
[2:01:02] &gt;&gt; the church.
[2:01:04] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[2:01:05] &gt;&gt; See, so what is it? It's the quickening
[2:01:07] power. How many believe that?
[2:01:09] &gt;&gt; You believe that's what the Holy Ghost
[2:01:10] is? Prophet said when the Holy Ghost
[2:01:12] came on the days of in the day of
[2:01:14] Pentecost, it so quickened them. It
[2:01:16] quickened their tongue to where they
[2:01:17] spoke in new tongues. It quickened their
[2:01:19] bodies. Amen. It quickened everything
[2:01:22] about them. And when that happens to
[2:01:25] you, you know,
[2:01:28] &gt;&gt; you're free.
[2:01:31] Amen.
[2:01:33] &gt;&gt; And the Bible says his spirit bears
[2:01:35] record or witness
[2:01:38] with our spirit
[2:01:40] &gt;&gt; that we are the sons of God.
[2:01:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:43] &gt;&gt; So our new lineage now doesn't start
[2:01:46] with Adam.
[2:01:50] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[2:01:51] &gt;&gt; Because that lineage is dead.
[2:01:54] &gt;&gt; That that that is that we you know I'm a
[2:01:58] son of God. That's right.
[2:02:02] &gt;&gt; Right.
[2:02:03] &gt;&gt; The word seed has been quickened and
[2:02:07] that holy image that Adam and Eve lost
[2:02:10] is restored.
[2:02:14] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that?
[2:02:16] &gt;&gt; It's restored. It's something that
[2:02:20] happens and is continually happening.
[2:02:24] &gt;&gt; Why? Romans 8:29, for whom he did forno,
[2:02:28] he also did predestinate to be
[2:02:30] conformed. Everybody say conformed to
[2:02:33] the image of his son. Why did God save
[2:02:35] you? To be conformed to the image of his
[2:02:37] son to restore that holy image back unto
[2:02:40] you.
[2:02:42] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[2:02:43] &gt;&gt; You're not a sinner. You're a saint.
[2:02:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:50] &gt;&gt; I hope that makes sense to you.
[2:02:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But it's, you know, Paul
[2:02:55] said, we're being changed from glory
[2:02:57] unto glory. Glory unto glory.
[2:03:00] &gt;&gt; It's like a seed. The prophet said, you
[2:03:02] plant that seed in the ground. It's
[2:03:04] there. It is the original seed. It falls
[2:03:06] into the ground. It comes up like the
[2:03:08] the corn of wheat. It comes up and and
[2:03:12] and like a like a sprout blade. Then it
[2:03:16] then it's changed from that and goes on
[2:03:19] into the tassel. And then from there,
[2:03:21] it's changed from that. It goes into the
[2:03:23] the the shuck and then from there it's
[2:03:26] changed and goes back to its original
[2:03:28] grain. Ain't that right?
[2:03:30] &gt;&gt; Well, that's the way the process God
[2:03:32] uses that. Brother Brandon used that.
[2:03:34] Amen. To show us the true church, the
[2:03:37] true church is the original seed of God.
[2:03:42] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:03:42] &gt;&gt; You believe it?
[2:03:44] &gt;&gt; So notice he says the bride will have to
[2:03:46] be the word. Word added to word. Add to
[2:03:49] word. See Luther's justification. Wesley
[2:03:52] sanctification, Pentecostals, baptism of
[2:03:54] the Holy Ghost, changing, changing,
[2:03:56] changing, restoration of the gifts, and
[2:03:59] all the rest of it goes with it. See,
[2:04:02] it's got to be word on top of word, germ
[2:04:04] on top of germ, life on top of life to
[2:04:07] bring out the full stature of the bride
[2:04:09] of the Lord Jesus Christ. In other place
[2:04:12] he says the same Jesus in the bride
[2:04:14] form, same power, same church, same
[2:04:17] thing, same word, the same word sucked
[2:04:20] up through these a uh and come out here
[2:04:23] and come to a a head here. And all that
[2:04:26] life come through here picked up its
[2:04:29] people.
[2:04:31] That life picked up the elect out of
[2:04:32] Luther's age. That life picked up the a
[2:04:35] the people the the elect out of Wesley's
[2:04:38] and out of the Pentecostal age. Now it's
[2:04:41] forming up into a head for the rapture.
[2:04:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:47] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[2:04:48] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[2:04:49] &gt;&gt; Another place he said the same the sun
[2:04:50] that rose in the east. It's the same son
[2:04:52] that's manifesting the thing in the west
[2:04:55] changing from glory unto glory
[2:04:59] &gt;&gt; unto glory. It's changing church. This
[2:05:02] church has been changing through the
[2:05:04] ages from one glory to another glory to
[2:05:07] another glory. It ain't saying that they
[2:05:08] ain't part of us. They had that glory,
[2:05:11] but now it's changed into another glory.
[2:05:13] Can you say amen? We're glad for what
[2:05:15] God done in that Pentecostal age, but
[2:05:17] that's not where we're at. We've changed
[2:05:19] into another glory and and we're getting
[2:05:22] closer and closer, and you as
[2:05:24] individuals are changing. If you've got
[2:05:27] the Holy Ghost, that seed has been
[2:05:29] quickened down inside of you. You cannot
[2:05:32] remain the same. It's changing from
[2:05:36] glory unto glory. And how is the change
[2:05:39] coming? If the spirit of him that raised
[2:05:43] up Christ from the dead dwell in you,
[2:05:46] &gt;&gt; that same spirit that raised him from
[2:05:48] the dead,
[2:05:49] &gt;&gt; if it dwells in you, shall also quicken
[2:05:52] your mortal body.
[2:05:54] &gt;&gt; It's a quickening power.
[2:05:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:57] &gt;&gt; I hope this is all right.
[2:06:00] &gt;&gt; Romans 10 or Revelations 10:1. And I saw
[2:06:02] another mighty angel
[2:06:04] coming down from heaven clothed with a
[2:06:08] cloud and a rainbow upon his head.
[2:06:10] &gt;&gt; And his face was as it were the sun and
[2:06:14] his feet as pillars of fire. And we know
[2:06:16] this is Christ.
[2:06:18] &gt;&gt; He had in his hand a little open book.
[2:06:21] And he set his right foot upon the sea
[2:06:23] and his left foot on the earth. And he
[2:06:25] cried with loud voice as when a lion
[2:06:27] roarth. And when he had cried, seven
[2:06:30] thunders uttered their voices. Now
[2:06:33] notice what a prophet said. Where are we
[2:06:34] at? We see nations breaking, Israel
[2:06:37] awakening, the signs that this Bible
[2:06:39] foretold for this day. We see the
[2:06:42] mechanical things taking place now. The
[2:06:45] spirit, the dynamics that promised word
[2:06:49] of that promised word is getting into
[2:06:51] his church and drive them to Calvary
[2:06:55] yonder into the rapture. And there we
[2:06:58] are.
[2:07:00] &gt;&gt; The dynamics,
[2:07:02] the quickening power
[2:07:04] &gt;&gt; descending and coming into the church,
[2:07:08] &gt;&gt; quickening the promises to us.
[2:07:11] &gt;&gt; And as many as received him, to them
[2:07:14] gave he power
[2:07:16] &gt;&gt; to become sons of God.
[2:07:19] &gt;&gt; You see, you can you can sit here and
[2:07:21] listen day in and day out.
[2:07:24] You can go home. You can listen to the
[2:07:27] tapes.
[2:07:29] But the prophet said, "If the spirit has
[2:07:32] never quickened you
[2:07:34] till you could follow the word of God,
[2:07:36] that you women and you men could obey
[2:07:39] every word that he's written." That's a
[2:07:42] dangerous thing.
[2:07:44] What if you would be a dead seed and no
[2:07:46] life in you?
[2:07:48] He says, "But if there's something in
[2:07:50] you that tells you, I want to rise this
[2:07:52] morning.
[2:07:54] I want to rise from the state that I'm
[2:07:56] in. I don't want to be just a dead seed,
[2:07:59] be left to dirt and driftwood. I want to
[2:08:03] rise.
[2:08:04] &gt;&gt; The only way you could want that and
[2:08:05] desire that is there's something down
[2:08:07] inside you calling.
[2:08:12] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[2:08:16] &gt;&gt; So he comes down to reveal the book.
[2:08:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:08:24] Seventh verse. But in the days of the
[2:08:27] voice of the seventh angel, when he
[2:08:29] shall begin to sound, the mystery of God
[2:08:31] should be finished, as he hath declared
[2:08:33] to his servants, the prophets. And as we
[2:08:35] know, and this is important, the seventh
[2:08:38] angel is on earth at the time of this
[2:08:41] coming.
[2:08:42] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Yes, sir.
[2:08:43] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[2:08:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:08:45] &gt;&gt; The prophet said, "The lamb took the
[2:08:47] book. Glory. opened the book, tore off
[2:08:49] the seals, and sent it down to the earth
[2:08:51] to his seventh angel to reveal it to his
[2:08:54] people.
[2:08:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:08:56] &gt;&gt; If the musicians will come,
[2:08:59] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:09:00] &gt;&gt; So, what is this all about?
[2:09:03] Well, the lamb didn't come to die.
[2:09:06] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:09:07] &gt;&gt; He already did it.
[2:09:11] &gt;&gt; But notice what Paul said in Romans
[2:09:14] 8:17. If we are children, then we're hes
[2:09:18] of God and joint hes with Christ. If so
[2:09:20] be that we suffer with him, that we may
[2:09:22] also be glorified together.
[2:09:25] &gt;&gt; So the prophet says that Jesus came in
[2:09:28] four sons name,
[2:09:31] the name of four sons.
[2:09:34] He come as son of David
[2:09:38] which makes him heir to the throne.
[2:09:41] He come as son of Abraham
[2:09:44] which made him heir to the royal grant.
[2:09:48] He came as the son of of of man
[2:09:54] which made him heir of all things in
[2:09:57] heaven and earth. Can you say amen?
[2:10:02] &gt;&gt; See so now notice as the heir he's he's
[2:10:06] become possessor. He's heir.
[2:10:10] He paid the price and now he came and
[2:10:13] took the book of inheritance.
[2:10:16] &gt;&gt; He come and took the book of promises.
[2:10:20] Right?
[2:10:23] &gt;&gt; The prophet says the lamb comes. He
[2:10:26] breaks the seals and reveals
[2:10:29] gives us his inheritance to his people.
[2:10:34] He gives the inheritance that he
[2:10:36] inherited becoming kinsman redeemer and
[2:10:39] freely gives it out to us. It all belong
[2:10:42] to him. He's the one who redeemed. But
[2:10:45] instead of keeping it himself, he gives
[2:10:47] it back to the people. That's his love
[2:10:49] for us.
[2:10:51] [Music]
[2:10:54] &gt;&gt; Bless the name of the Lord.
[2:10:57] So when you're listening to the message
[2:10:59] and you're seeing these promises and
[2:11:00] you're looking at it and maybe you don't
[2:11:02] even understand the word of what he's
[2:11:04] trying to say and all these things, just
[2:11:05] say, "I'm an heir to it.
[2:11:08] I'm an heir to it. This is the lamb.
[2:11:11] This is the lamb giving it back. Giving
[2:11:14] it back to me." That's my promise.
[2:11:16] That's my promise. That's my promise.
[2:11:18] Can you say amen? Amen. Everything it
[2:11:21] belongs to me. We are heirs of healing.
[2:11:23] We are heirs of deliverance. We are
[2:11:25] heirs of of heaven. We are heirs of the
[2:11:28] new city. We are heirs to the throne.
[2:11:32] &gt;&gt; We are heirs to immortality.
[2:11:35] Heirs to eternal life. We are heirs of
[2:11:39] righteousness.
[2:11:41] Can you say amen?
[2:11:43] &gt;&gt; And notice what a prophet. It's the Holy
[2:11:45] Spirit today. That's why he's come. It's
[2:11:49] the Holy Spirit today hunting out
[2:11:51] hunting out honest hearts that will
[2:11:53] believe that message. Everything in the
[2:11:55] Bible that was promised is to that
[2:11:57] believer. And when you accept it in its
[2:11:59] fullness and God knows that you'll do
[2:12:02] it, he gives you the abstract to that.
[2:12:04] And then every promise that's made is in
[2:12:07] your possession.
[2:12:09] It's in your possession. Church,
[2:12:11] remember, you got to go take the book.
[2:12:17] That's the commission. Go get the book
[2:12:19] from the angel and eat it up.
[2:12:22] Why? It's yours.
[2:12:26] You don't have to walk away from it and
[2:12:27] forfeit it. Adam done that, but not
[2:12:30] today.
[2:12:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:12:32] &gt;&gt; This book is ours. Say what you will.
[2:12:34] Will will
[2:12:35] &gt;&gt; speak to the mountain. And we've seen a
[2:12:38] redeemed man of God in this age. a
[2:12:40] redeemed body that became a channel that
[2:12:43] God could work through and speak and
[2:12:46] create squirrels. Create a spoken word
[2:12:49] and it created squirrels. Can you say
[2:12:51] amen? The dead came to life. Amen. He
[2:12:54] even stopped the storm. But it wasn't
[2:12:57] just for brother Brandham. It was for
[2:12:59] every one of us. He was just showing
[2:13:01] what we have been redeemed back to. Our
[2:13:04] position. Remember church, it wasn't
[2:13:07] until the book became open that now it
[2:13:10] becomes in this age time for adoption,
[2:13:14] the manifestation of sons of God. That's
[2:13:16] where we're at. We couldn't do it
[2:13:18] without the book being open.
[2:13:22] Glad for what they done in the book of
[2:13:23] Acts.
[2:13:25] Glad for all the things that they done
[2:13:27] in the book of Acts. But that wasn't
[2:13:28] adoption. I have to tell you, it wasn't
[2:13:31] adoption.
[2:13:32] It was the original seed that went in
[2:13:34] the ground. I I get that it was the the
[2:13:37] pure seed of God. And look what they
[2:13:39] done as the seed. But that seed went in
[2:13:41] the ground. It died. It rotted. And it
[2:13:44] began to spring forth. Now we're back.
[2:13:48] This is the son of man age. This is the
[2:13:51] adoption age. This is the sons of God
[2:13:55] coming to their position.
[2:14:00] Not as sons of Adam up from the sex
[2:14:02] seed, but the seed a word seed. Every
[2:14:06] name written in this book is coming to
[2:14:08] manifestation.
[2:14:10] Bride manifestation.
[2:14:14] &gt;&gt; Do you love him? Hallelujah.
[2:14:18] Hallelujah. Read one more. He said, "The
[2:14:20] works that I do shall you do also.
[2:14:23] These signs shall follow them that
[2:14:25] believe." That is the assurance. When we
[2:14:26] see a group of people sitting together
[2:14:28] and those signs manifesting themselves,
[2:14:31] that's the assurance that the abstract
[2:14:33] is there to vindicate that that's
[2:14:35] property of God.
[2:14:38] So we are Easter also. We're we are now
[2:14:41] in our Easter. We've already raised,
[2:14:44] hallelujah, from the things of the world
[2:14:46] to the things of God's promise.
[2:14:49] Not we will, we are. It's the
[2:14:51] potentials. It's God's promise. He had
[2:14:54] poured out his spirit in the last days.
[2:14:56] And that's what they would do. Notice,
[2:14:59] laid their hands on the sick, everything
[2:15:01] that was in God's promise, I shall pour
[2:15:03] out my spirit in the last days upon all
[2:15:06] flesh. Your old men shall dream dreams.
[2:15:08] Your young men shall see visions. All
[2:15:10] these different promises that he made,
[2:15:12] everything is laying right there in
[2:15:14] God's promise. Jesus redeemed it to us.
[2:15:21] He said, "If we are ordained on that
[2:15:23] ground, if we are ordained to be on that
[2:15:26] ground, like the eagle walking in the
[2:15:28] chicken's nest, if you're ordained on
[2:15:30] that ground, the Holy Spirit is here to
[2:15:32] find you. And when it finds you, you
[2:15:35] recognize its call. You know the hour
[2:15:38] you're living, you know that these
[2:15:40] things are supposed to happen. Quickly,
[2:15:42] you're raptured up to meet it. And now
[2:15:44] you're sitting in heavenly places in
[2:15:46] Christ Jesus." Oh, what a promise.
[2:15:50] What a heavenly father who would give us
[2:15:51] these things. Can you say amen?
[2:15:55] &gt;&gt; Oh my. He says, notice I just skipped
[2:15:57] through. He says God's life which is in
[2:16:00] the Greek called Zoey
[2:16:03] moving through them and in them quicken
[2:16:05] their minds to his word. He said, let me
[2:16:07] say it real quietly now. The spirit of
[2:16:10] God that moves among the people quickens
[2:16:13] the mind of the person to the promise of
[2:16:15] God. It does it. as I'm trying to show
[2:16:19] you, let you realize that I'm speaking
[2:16:21] to the church now and also quickened to
[2:16:24] life in him. Although they was only
[2:16:27] attributes to begin with, but if God
[2:16:29] said in this day, back in the beginning,
[2:16:31] John Doe will be my servant millions of
[2:16:33] years ago. John Doe now is born in sin,
[2:16:36] shaping iniquity, come to the world
[2:16:38] speaking lies because he's immortal.
[2:16:41] Maybe he gets a little religious
[2:16:42] feeling. He'll join a church, maybe join
[2:16:44] Pentecostal, don't know. He might join
[2:16:47] anything. But let him get under the
[2:16:49] atmosphere of God once. John Doe is
[2:16:52] bound to recognize who his father is.
[2:16:54] Just as that eagle recognized who the
[2:16:56] mother was, it's got to realize it. Only
[2:16:59] that John Doe is God's attribute that's
[2:17:02] become a word spoken. Then the Holy
[2:17:04] Spirit seeks that word out. Here it is.
[2:17:07] He calls him, give him everlasting life
[2:17:10] and brings him into the presence of God,
[2:17:13] God's word.
[2:17:16] Can you say amen?
[2:17:18] &gt;&gt; He said, "See,
[2:17:20] when the spirit of God comes upon you
[2:17:22] and you truly are one of God's
[2:17:24] attributes that he's spoken of,
[2:17:27] now if you're not, you'll wonder and
[2:17:29] flusterate, run here and there and
[2:17:31] everything else and never come to the
[2:17:33] knowledge of the truth. But if you are
[2:17:35] one of those, the old things pass away
[2:17:37] right quick. You become new. The plan of
[2:17:40] salvation is finished. You're ready to
[2:17:43] obey every word that God ever spoke of
[2:17:45] you for you to do. You're submissive to
[2:17:47] his word. The contract exactly the
[2:17:50] abstract to the contract. The title deed
[2:17:52] belongs to you. The debts are all paid.
[2:17:55] It's struck off just as it was at the
[2:17:58] day of Pentecost. Can you say amen?
