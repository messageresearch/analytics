[41:38] righteousness for his name's sake
[41:40] and yea though I walk through the valley
[41:42] of the shadow of death I will
[41:44] fear no evil
[41:47] for thou art with me
[41:49] thy rod and thy staff they comfort me
[41:53] amen you can have your seats this
[41:56] evening
[41:59] we had wonderful Services last Sunday
[42:02] and brother Andrew just did a wonderful
[42:05] job and
[42:07] and dealing with the fact that he is
[42:10] here
[42:11] Christ is here and he's on schedule and
[42:15] I thought both sermons were a
[42:18] masterpiece
[42:20] and um
[42:23] I'll tell you what it's it's good to
[42:25] know that he is here with us amen and I
[42:28] think this is what David was saying
[42:30] there thou art with me I will fear no
[42:33] evil for thou art with me
[42:35] but looking at this this this old
[42:39] chapter of Psalms 23 it deals of course
[42:43] with the Lord being Our Shepherd and we
[42:46] being his sheep
[42:48] and one would think that
[42:51] um
[42:52] maybe it would be a slap in God's face
[42:55] to be called a Shepherd someone to
[42:58] identify him as a shepherd and
[43:02] as the way brother Branham tells us is
[43:05] that a Shepherd was the most illiterate
[43:08] uh person
[43:11] of all people in in because he didn't
[43:16] know anything but his sheep
[43:18] uh and so he didn't need to to know the
[43:23] you know mathematics he didn't need to
[43:25] know the science he didn't he needed
[43:27] didn't need to be trained in education
[43:31] all he needed to know was how to call
[43:35] his sheep
[43:36] and this is why God notified the
[43:40] Shepherds
[43:42] there when Jesus was born of course he
[43:46] was born being the Lamb of God
[43:50] born in a stable
[43:52] where Lambs I guess were should be born
[43:56] and and yet God would notify the
[44:00] Shepherds
[44:02] he bypassed
[44:04] the educated he bypassed the the
[44:08] clergyman the prophet would say the
[44:10] Churchman he bypassed the teachers who
[44:14] had theological training
[44:16] and he really Brown said all the
[44:19] learning and money that they spent on
[44:22] all the missionaries and all the prosely
[44:24] lighting and all the memberships and
[44:26] everything that they had done to honor
[44:28] God yet the key message bypassed them
[44:33] said God in his wisdom passed up all the
[44:35] importance of the Land There were
[44:37] important people great teachers Caiaphas
[44:40] the high priest and many other great men
[44:42] all Israel's Mighty learned all the
[44:45] denominations and all the boasting
[44:47] theologians and yet God passed all of
[44:50] them
[44:51] and then brother Brown says it showed
[44:53] that they were trained in the wrong
[44:54] field
[44:56] they they should have been trained on
[44:59] how to recognize sheep
[45:01] they should have been trained on how to
[45:04] to identify and so God gave the greatest
[45:08] message to the most illiterate men and
[45:12] that was the Shepherds
[45:16] says the highest Heavens hastening to
[45:19] honor Earth's most humble and unlearned
[45:23] the highest of Heaven came down to make
[45:26] himself known to the lowest of the earth
[45:28] bypassing all between to make himself
[45:32] known to Common herdsmen
[45:34] and so all of the learning and all of
[45:37] men's wisdom and all of their education
[45:40] and all their their their things was
[45:43] laid to waste right then
[45:45] it was at that time that God when he
[45:48] bypassed it all he showed that none of
[45:51] that mattered
[45:52] because he gave the greatest message
[45:56] to Shepherds
[45:59] and God knew that they would receive the
[46:03] message and the message was Messiah is
[46:07] on earth now
[46:09] ain't that right
[46:10] and so he knew that they would receive
[46:13] it but then brother Brown goes on
[46:14] talking about Shepherds and we've read
[46:16] it before but he says the shepherd stays
[46:19] with the Sheep so much till he even
[46:22] laughs like the Sheep bleeding see he
[46:25] talks like the Sheep he smells like the
[46:28] Sheep that's right because he's with the
[46:30] Sheep that's all he knows is his sheep
[46:32] ain't that rhyme so here David is saying
[46:35] that the Lord is my shepherd and so the
[46:38] Lord is the great Shepherd and and he
[46:41] knows nothing but his sheep ain't that
[46:44] right he knows nothing and we know that
[46:48] he wrote each name of his sheep on the
[46:50] Lamb's Book of Life
[46:53] and his his whole focus is is them sheep
[46:57] that's right
[46:58] and John 10 27 Jesus says my sheep hear
[47:02] my voice and I know them
[47:05] and they follow me and I give unto them
[47:08] eternal life and they shall never perish
[47:10] neither shall any man pluck them out of
[47:13] my hand ain't that right and he says my
[47:16] Father which gave them me is greater
[47:18] than all and no man is able to pluck
[47:21] them out of my father's hand and I and
[47:24] my father are one
[47:26] so he goes on in Matthew 7 22 Jesus
[47:30] would say many will say to me in that
[47:33] day Lord Lord have we not prophesied in
[47:35] thy name and in thy name have cast out
[47:38] devils and in thy name done many
[47:39] wonderful works then I will profess unto
[47:42] them I never knew you
[47:45] amen that that knowledge uh so now we
[47:48] know that the knowledge isn't isn't
[47:50] brain knowledge it's an intimate
[47:52] knowledge I never had that intimate
[47:55] relationship with you depart from me ye
[47:59] that work iniquity ain't that right so
[48:02] it's a knowledge that grows goes into a
[48:04] relationship and and these things so the
[48:07] Lord being the shepherd He has a
[48:09] personal knowledge of his sheep he's he
[48:12] he's known of his sheep and he knows his
[48:16] sheep a man and so when he was on Earth
[48:19] he he he he he he didn't just wonder
[48:23] about trying to find out who would
[48:25] accept him he was after his sheep ain't
[48:29] that right and he's still after his
[48:31] sheep today
[48:33] amen but in studying the the 23rd
[48:36] chapter here of Psalms I I have found
[48:40] that it this this this chapter deals
[48:43] with Redemption our Redemption it deals
[48:47] with our restoration
[48:50] throughout the the the the Bible the the
[48:53] message of redemption has been given by
[48:57] Shepherds and through sheep
[49:01] Shepherds and sheep have represented
[49:04] Redemption
[49:05] and so it it and of course it all speaks
[49:08] of the uh the great Shepherd and and the
[49:13] true Lamb of God and and so God revealed
[49:16] himself by Shepherds and through sheep
[49:19] and so from the beginning uh of time I
[49:24] guess or or since the fall uh uh
[49:28] Redemption uh has been by sheep we find
[49:32] that Adam and Eve after they hit sin uh
[49:36] uh they couldn't come into the presence
[49:39] of God uh they they needed something
[49:42] Adam had hid from the presence of God
[49:45] but God wanted them to stand there in
[49:48] his presence
[49:50] and so there there come uh we find that
[49:54] Adam and Eve was standing in the
[49:57] presence of God to hear his message to
[50:00] them uh having been clothed a man with
[50:05] sheepskin ain't that right they they
[50:07] were draped uh uh with uh skins and the
[50:12] prophet said the first message that was
[50:14] given to a condemned generation was over
[50:18] the top of a dead sheepskin that God
[50:20] himself had slain and wrapped around
[50:23] Adam and Eve ain't that right
[50:26] so we we find of course that Adam and
[50:29] Eve had tried to make a covering for
[50:30] themselves and it and it didn't work and
[50:33] and so we must use what God has provided
[50:37] in order for us to stand in his presence
[50:40] or you'll never get anywhere with God in
[50:44] in that way it takes the way that God
[50:46] has provided ain't that right and from
[50:49] the very beginning God instituted a
[50:54] sheep sacrifice a man even Before Time
[50:57] When God drew his program out in his
[51:01] mind and spoke it before the foundation
[51:04] of the world Christ the lamb the true
[51:07] lamb was slain right then so God had
[51:12] already had in his mind it would be a
[51:14] lamb and it would be an atonement a man
[51:17] for the sins of man and and yet it would
[51:21] take it would be 4 000 years or so later
[51:25] that the the I am Christ would actually
[51:28] be slain but God had ordained that the
[51:33] blood of the Lamb which was Christ was
[51:37] what would provide the atonement ain't
[51:40] that right
[51:41] we find that that the whole the whole
[51:44] theme of the Old Testament was built
[51:47] around the coming Messiah brother
[51:50] Branham says the motives and the
[51:52] objectives of the whole Old Testament
[51:54] prophets them men had one objective and
[51:57] that was Jesus Christ ain't that right
[52:00] amen of since the beginning it was all
[52:04] speaking of Christ amen even before the
[52:08] foundation of the world God had Christ
[52:09] in his mind as as an atonement brother
[52:14] Brown says they did not go out and do
[52:16] things just for money or for fame they
[52:19] had one thing and they were Anointed
[52:21] with the spirit of God and they
[52:23] predicted the coming Messiah and those
[52:26] men were so Anointed with the spirit
[52:28] until they sometimes acted like the
[52:31] spirit that was within them they spoke
[52:34] seemingly of themselves so common born
[52:38] men and yet their Ministry spoke of the
[52:41] coming of of the of of of of Christ
[52:44] their their their prophecy spoke of the
[52:48] coming of Christ the very lives and the
[52:51] actions spoke of the coming of Christ
[52:54] can you say Amen the great Shepherd and
[52:57] and so uh uh prophets and they they in
[53:01] the Old Testament were usually herdsmen
[53:04] Shepherds uh uh Abraham Isaac David
[53:07] Moses uh Jacob and and so on uh they
[53:12] they were prophets and yet they were
[53:14] they were shepherds and and so uh but
[53:17] their lives in they reflected the Good
[53:20] Shepherd uh which was Jesus Christ a man
[53:24] uh Peter called Christ the good or the
[53:27] chief Shepherd amen Paul would declare
[53:30] that he is the shepherd and Bishop of
[53:33] our souls ain't that rhyme so then the
[53:36] prophets as Shepherds spoke of of of the
[53:41] the the great Shepherd that would become
[53:44] and and they clothed themselves in
[53:47] sheepskin amen the prophets did they
[53:50] they clothed themselves in sheepskin
[53:52] they wore the prophet said they Ward the
[53:55] skin of the sheep they were hurting
[53:56] which signified that their faith was in
[54:00] his word of the coming perfect lamb now
[54:04] think of that the prophets amen the word
[54:07] come to the prophet so they knew that
[54:09] the lamb would come and even though they
[54:12] were hurting these sheep uh the natural
[54:15] sheep yet they would wear that that
[54:18] sheep's skin amen as a testament that my
[54:21] faith is in the true Lamb of God that
[54:25] was to come we know that sheep have to
[54:28] be guided in sheep is totally helpless
[54:31] without the shepherd Amen to guide it it
[54:34] cannot go itself and and so brother
[54:37] Brown said that's the reason God likened
[54:39] his believing children unto sheep
[54:42] they've got to be guided but watch
[54:44] what's guiding you don't get a goal
[54:47] he'll walk you to the slaughter pin God
[54:50] never gave us a goal he gave us his son
[54:53] the holy spirit to guide us he is our
[54:57] God not some man-made herdsmen but a
[55:01] god-given herdsman who feed the sheep
[55:04] leap upon sheep food ain't that right we
[55:08] find about sheep it they have to have a
[55:10] certain diet because that's their nature
[55:13] uh uh and and the prophet would tell us
[55:16] that sheep food is the word of God a man
[55:19] for the age ain't that right Jesus the
[55:22] Lamb of God even declared my meat is to
[55:25] do the will of him that sent me so that
[55:28] was his food was to do the will of the
[55:31] father a man that sent him and that's
[55:33] the only diet that that any of God's
[55:36] sheep will feed on a man is the will of
[55:39] the father ain't that right and his word
[55:42] is his will do you believe that his word
[55:46] is his will doves also have to have a
[55:49] particular diet they just can't can't
[55:51] feed off of everything and or anything
[55:54] and and of course Dove represents the
[55:56] the Holy Ghost and and and and uh uh
[56:00] it's their nature they they have to have
[56:02] a certain diet but a crow people can eat
[56:04] on anything and and the prophet called
[56:07] him a hypocrite he said he's the biggest
[56:10] hit the hypocrite there is because he's
[56:12] a vulture he's a scavenger he can sit
[56:14] out there and eat on a dead horse all
[56:16] day and fly out there in the field and
[56:18] eat grain with the dove see he said you
[56:21] you you you give a sheep or a dove
[56:24] something contrary to the word of God he
[56:26] cannot stand it but the devil can take
[56:29] the word of take can take the word and
[56:32] the world too and call them both
[56:35] of God see amen see because his his
[56:40] nature see so so when David is saying
[56:43] the Lord is my shepherd amen there's a
[56:47] lot that is being said there a man
[56:49] between the lines ain't that right now
[56:52] Jesus said my sheep know my voice and
[56:55] another they will not follow and his
[56:57] voice is his word do you believe that
[57:00] his voice is his word and the word comes
[57:03] to the the prophets and and so they were
[57:06] the voice of God to the people that they
[57:09] were sent to amen and so brother Branham
[57:13] would call them Shepherd prophets amen
[57:16] they were Shepherd prophets and uh uh uh
[57:19] uh and and and he would tell us that
[57:22] that prophets Shepherds and sheep they
[57:24] all testify of the coming of of Messiah
[57:29] the coming of Christ it all testifies a
[57:33] man so so it gives us a deeper meaning
[57:36] when we're when we're reading uh in in
[57:39] these in in this chapter a man and God
[57:42] is reflected a man in the prophets God's
[57:45] reflected in the in the Shepherds God's
[57:48] reflected in the Sheep ain't that right
[57:50] a man see and we find that in the Old
[57:54] Testament it was through and by the
[57:57] Shepherds that God did Shepherd his
[58:01] Sheep amen uh I I for example
[58:05] um Exodus 3 and 7 and uh it says and the
[58:09] Lord said and he's talking to Moses now
[58:12] he says I have surely seen the
[58:14] Affliction of my people which are in
[58:16] Egypt and have heard their Cry by reason
[58:18] of their task Masters for I know their
[58:21] sorrows and I am come down to deliver
[58:24] them out of the hand of the Egyptians to
[58:27] bring them up out of that land unto a
[58:30] good land a and a large and to a land
[58:33] flowing with milk and honey unto the
[58:36] place of the Canaanites the Hittites
[58:38] amorites parasites hivites and jebusites
[58:41] now therefore Behold The Cry of the
[58:44] children is come unto me and I have also
[58:47] seen the oppression wherewith the
[58:49] Egyptians oppressed them come now
[58:52] therefore and I will send thee unto
[58:55] Pharaoh that thou may bring forth my
[58:58] people the children of Israel out of
[59:01] Egypt ain't that right so God would
[59:04] would send his Shepherd Prophet down to
[59:08] Egypt with a message amen and through
[59:11] him God was going to deliver his people
[59:15] out of the out of the land to bondage
[59:18] ain't that right now now Moses it's
[59:21] amazing but Moses is a type of Christ
[59:24] you know everything that brother Brown
[59:26] said Moses typed Christ perfectly he was
[59:30] born under persecution Jesus was born
[59:34] under persecution the devil was trying
[59:36] to catch Moses and he was trying to
[59:38] catch Jesus Moses was a servant and a
[59:42] deliverer Jesus was the great servant
[59:44] and deliverer Moses was a lawgiver and
[59:48] priest Jesus was the law giver and
[59:50] priest so he was everything that Christ
[59:53] was ain't that right amen just a common
[59:56] born man but yet God would reflect
[59:59] himself through that Prophet shepherd
[1:00:02] shepherd prophecy and so uh we we find
[1:00:06] that when God gave Moses a the
[1:00:08] commission a man after burning bush he
[1:00:12] uh there was no one on that mountain but
[1:00:15] but Jehovah and Moses and and notice
[1:00:18] Exodus 4 and 6 the Lord said furthermore
[1:00:22] unto him but now thine hand into thy
[1:00:25] bosom and he put his hand into his bosom
[1:00:29] and when he took it out behold his hand
[1:00:32] was leprous as snow ain't that right now
[1:00:35] the Bible doesn't tell us what what hand
[1:00:38] uh Moses used but the prophet did and he
[1:00:42] said it was his right hand amen it was
[1:00:44] his right hand and there was a reason
[1:00:46] for it a man and and that's because that
[1:00:50] Moses was representing God now you think
[1:00:53] of that Moses was representing God God
[1:00:56] was in Moses ain't that right amen now
[1:01:00] now think of this because here God was
[1:01:02] going to show a man himself to be the
[1:01:05] shepherd a man through that Prophet
[1:01:07] Moses now see and so we find that Moses
[1:01:12] put his hand his right hand over his
[1:01:15] heart in in his bosom there where the
[1:01:18] hidden secrets of redemption had been
[1:01:22] laying a man since the foundation of the
[1:01:25] world ain't that right amen see and and
[1:01:28] we know a man that God has a right hand
[1:01:31] a man so here was Moses putting his
[1:01:34] right hand in his bosom a man as a as a
[1:01:37] sign a man that God has a right hand and
[1:01:40] and and the prophet said Jesus is the
[1:01:44] right hand of God Amen and he's hovering
[1:01:47] over God's heart ain't that right he was
[1:01:49] hid in the bosom of God Amen see and so
[1:01:55] here Moses was portraying uh uh exactly
[1:02:00] see and and so then we find that Jesus
[1:02:03] Jesus held the secrets of the father and
[1:02:07] has now showed them unto us amen say so
[1:02:11] we find that Moses put his right hand in
[1:02:15] over his heart in his books of man and
[1:02:17] when he pulled it out that his right
[1:02:20] hand out and and exposed it we could say
[1:02:23] it that way revealed it it was white as
[1:02:27] leprosy ain't that right white as snow
[1:02:29] it was leprosy ain't that right but God
[1:02:33] was going to show what he would do to
[1:02:35] his own right hand amen see leprosy
[1:02:38] represents sin ain't that right amen it
[1:02:41] represents sin amen and and but yet this
[1:02:45] leprosy amen was a different leprosy
[1:02:48] because it was in the last stages a man
[1:02:51] of leprosy which is incurable amen the
[1:02:55] prophet said it was an incurable thing
[1:02:57] that that that no doctor no no preacher
[1:03:01] no Theologian no nothing a man could
[1:03:04] cure amen this leprosy ain't that right
[1:03:07] amen saying soap his hand was smitten
[1:03:11] with a horrible thing because it was it
[1:03:14] was the leprosy was white as snow a man
[1:03:18] the prophet said and that's where the
[1:03:20] world was when God pulled his right hand
[1:03:23] from his own bosom amen the world was
[1:03:27] full of leprosy in such a way that there
[1:03:31] was nothing that could cure the sin of
[1:03:34] the world ain't that right amen there
[1:03:37] was nothing that could hear it see the
[1:03:39] world was smitten with deadly leprosy
[1:03:42] and there was no cure at all for it and
[1:03:45] if you notice the prophet said the
[1:03:47] leprosy didn't come on just gradually
[1:03:49] amen it was an instant thing when he put
[1:03:52] his hand in his wisdom and pulled it out
[1:03:54] amen it was it was automatically in the
[1:03:58] stage four or the last stage of leprosy
[1:04:01] and he said that is the way the sin was
[1:04:04] when God told Adam and Eve the day you
[1:04:07] do it the day you partake of is the day
[1:04:10] that you're going to die
[1:04:13] can you say Amen so we find that God
[1:04:17] representing himself Amen in the prophet
[1:04:20] Moses that Prophet Shepherd amen now we
[1:04:23] find that Moses smote himself amen no
[1:04:26] one else got his right hand and stuck it
[1:04:28] in his bosom a man Moses took his own
[1:04:31] right hand and stuck it in his bosom
[1:04:33] ain't that right amen by the Commandment
[1:04:36] of God he put his own right hand into
[1:04:38] his bosom and pulled it out and it was
[1:04:41] smitten with Leprosy amen but showing
[1:04:45] what Jesus the great Shepherd amen would
[1:04:47] do for us
[1:04:50] can you say amen that's right see Jesus
[1:04:54] said in John 18 no man taketh my life
[1:04:57] from me I lay it down of myself
[1:05:01] can you say Amen so he was the great
[1:05:04] Shepherd ain't that right he the great
[1:05:07] shepherd He took our guilt he took our
[1:05:10] sin amen and smote himself he took our
[1:05:14] sins and laid it upon himself as Isaiah
[1:05:17] said he was wounded for our
[1:05:18] transgression he was bruised for our
[1:05:21] iniquity the chastisement of our peace
[1:05:24] was upon him with his stripes we are
[1:05:26] healed ain't that right you know the
[1:05:28] prophet said the secret of God's healing
[1:05:31] of redemption laid in the bosom of God
[1:05:35] it was there in the bosom of God
[1:05:40] that's right see amen the secret had
[1:05:43] been in God's bosom all these years
[1:05:45] covered by his right hand Jesus Christ
[1:05:49] amen but if you notice a man the leprosy
[1:05:53] left just as quickly as it came
[1:05:57] a man for when Moses put it back in
[1:06:00] return the right hand his right hand
[1:06:02] back into his bosom and pulled it out it
[1:06:06] was clean amen there was no leprosy
[1:06:09] ain't that right amen see so we find
[1:06:12] that that when our great Shepherd hung
[1:06:15] on Calvary he said the greatest words
[1:06:18] that you could ever hear it is finished
[1:06:22] see it wasn't a gradual thing it was a
[1:06:25] instant thing amen that sin Was Defeated
[1:06:29] right there sickness Was Defeated right
[1:06:32] there amen trouble Was Defeated right
[1:06:35] there can you say amen he conquered it's
[1:06:38] not a gradually conquering amen God
[1:06:41] ain't gradually Conquering the devil
[1:06:43] you're fighting a defeated enemy because
[1:06:46] of Calvary of 2000 years ago can you say
[1:06:50] Amen
[1:06:51] that's right sin was over
[1:06:54] the penalty was paid the debts were
[1:06:56] settled the prophet said it didn't take
[1:06:58] a year it was finished right then
[1:07:04] amen the Believers whose names were
[1:07:07] written in the land in The Book of Life
[1:07:10] predestinated from the foundation of the
[1:07:12] world it was finished everybody say it
[1:07:14] was finished
[1:07:16] to the believer it was finished
[1:07:19] Amen to every one of God's sheep it was
[1:07:22] finished
[1:07:24] my God would take a Shepherd Prophet to
[1:07:28] show what he would do through his amen
[1:07:30] through his own self can you say amen
[1:07:32] amen he would take that great nor that
[1:07:35] Shepherd Prophet amen and have him to
[1:07:37] pull a sign out to show what he would do
[1:07:40] when he would reveal his own right hand
[1:07:45] it redeemed
[1:07:47] the Sheep
[1:07:49] those whose names were written in the
[1:07:51] Book of Life Lamb's Book of Life
[1:07:53] predestinated from the world it was
[1:07:55] finished that very minute that Jesus
[1:07:57] said it was finished can you say Amen
[1:08:01] see God's right hand was pulled from his
[1:08:04] bosom and was smitten but then we find
[1:08:07] that on Easter
[1:08:09] God raised his right hand and returned
[1:08:11] it back to his bosom
[1:08:15] can you say Amen it returned back to his
[1:08:18] bosom oh my amen so God was showing what
[1:08:22] he would do in time amen through Moses
[1:08:25] of what he would do amen now it was
[1:08:27] being fulfilled God returning his right
[1:08:30] hand back into his bosom amen and then
[1:08:33] what does he do the prophet said he
[1:08:35] pulled his right hand out again and it
[1:08:38] extended to you and I but it isn't full
[1:08:40] of leprosy it's clean
[1:08:43] can you say amen that's right he
[1:08:46] extended it down to you and I in the
[1:08:49] form of his word why why would he do
[1:08:52] that to redeem us back Amen to the
[1:08:55] original position that we fell from in
[1:08:59] the garden
[1:09:02] amen
[1:09:04] so now the hidden secret of his great
[1:09:07] heart was revealed by a prophet Shepherd
[1:09:13] ain't that right
[1:09:15] yes sir
[1:09:17] so
[1:09:18] if you notice when David said
[1:09:23] he writes about the Lord being a
[1:09:26] shepherd
[1:09:29] then he
[1:09:31] he says thy right Thy Thy staff and I
[1:09:34] rod
[1:09:35] they comfort me
[1:09:38] the shepherd must have a rod a staff
[1:09:43] because he Shepherds his sheep with it
[1:09:46] ain't that right
[1:09:49] so it's only natural
[1:09:53] for David to to talk
[1:09:56] about the the the rod and the staff if
[1:09:59] he's talking about the shepherd
[1:10:02] but see I
[1:10:05] I don't believe that David was talking
[1:10:08] about something natural
[1:10:11] because he says thy rod and thy staff
[1:10:15] they comfort me
[1:10:18] David was UN finding comfort in some
[1:10:22] natural stick
[1:10:25] is that right
[1:10:28] but I believe he was looking at
[1:10:30] something that had been promised to come
[1:10:33] David being a Shepherd prophet
[1:10:36] the word came to him
[1:10:39] and he saw something greater than just
[1:10:41] an old stick
[1:10:44] you know I believe he was one of those
[1:10:46] that Paul spoke of in in Hebrews 11 13
[1:10:49] these all died in faith
[1:10:51] not having received the promises but
[1:10:53] having seen them afar off and were
[1:10:55] persuaded of them and embraced them
[1:10:59] and you say man
[1:11:01] I think what David was talking about
[1:11:03] here Isaiah begins to speak about it
[1:11:07] and says in in Isaiah 11 and 1 and there
[1:11:10] shall come forth a rod out of the stem
[1:11:13] of Jesse and a branch shall grow out of
[1:11:16] his roots and the spirit of the Lord
[1:11:18] shall rest upon him
[1:11:20] what speaking of Christ
[1:11:22] can you say Amen so David is a speaking
[1:11:26] of just something a man but he's
[1:11:28] speaking of a person
[1:11:30] thy wrought and thy staff they comfort
[1:11:33] me
[1:11:35] and you say Amen maybe the natural sheep
[1:11:39] found comfort in that in the in the
[1:11:41] stick in the natural stick but David saw
[1:11:43] something greater he was the Sheep but
[1:11:46] the Lord was his Shepherd
[1:11:50] he meant something greater
[1:11:52] than a stick
[1:11:54] that we find
[1:11:56] here that he found the comfort and
[1:11:58] notice he's speaking of the person of
[1:12:00] Christ because John 14 16 says and I
[1:12:04] will pray the father and he shall give
[1:12:07] you what
[1:12:09] another comforter
[1:12:12] now I'm just going to say it and you you
[1:12:13] Jacob take it however you want to but I
[1:12:15] believe that's what David was talking
[1:12:17] about
[1:12:18] hello
[1:12:19] David was seeing the comforter as a rod
[1:12:22] and staff
[1:12:24] can you say Amen
[1:12:26] Jesus is saying but it's the Holy Spirit
[1:12:29] that I will send unto you as a comforter
[1:12:34] that he may abide with you forever even
[1:12:37] everybody say even the spirit of Truth
[1:12:40] whom the world cannot receive because it
[1:12:43] seeth him not and neither knoweth him
[1:12:45] but you know him for he dwelleth with
[1:12:47] you and shall be in you
[1:12:52] I will not leave you comfortless I will
[1:12:55] come to you
[1:12:56] so he is that comforter
[1:12:59] he is that rod
[1:13:03] and you say man
[1:13:04] so Christ is our comforter he is the
[1:13:07] spirit of truth that has come in this
[1:13:09] day so thy rod and thy staff they
[1:13:12] comfort me
[1:13:14] now
[1:13:16] I want to again and I'm not going to
[1:13:19] keep you much longer but I I want to
[1:13:21] again refer
[1:13:22] to the prophet Shepherd Moses
[1:13:26] see God came down to deliver
[1:13:29] his people and to lead them out of in
[1:13:32] out of bondage into the land of promise
[1:13:35] but he used Moses
[1:13:37] to work through
[1:13:40] which was the type of Christ
[1:13:44] but he also used his rod
[1:13:48] to work through
[1:13:50] which was also
[1:13:52] a type of Christ
[1:13:55] Moses didn't have an army to use
[1:13:58] he didn't have the backing of Nations
[1:14:03] he didn't have a military weapons
[1:14:09] all he had
[1:14:10] was robbed
[1:14:14] all he had was a stick
[1:14:19] that God was going to use him that
[1:14:21] Prophet Shepherd
[1:14:24] and a stick
[1:14:27] to go deliver his people
[1:14:30] and not just to deliver them but to
[1:14:33] Shepherd them to the promised land
[1:14:37] is that right
[1:14:42] God's going to use that Rod to symbolize
[1:14:44] the great rod
[1:14:47] now Exodus 4 and 1 and Moses answered
[1:14:51] and said but behold they will not
[1:14:53] believe me nor hearken unto my voice for
[1:14:55] they will say the Lord hath not appeared
[1:14:57] unto thee
[1:14:59] now I want you to look at that now and I
[1:15:01] wish wished I had time and and things to
[1:15:04] go through it thank you
[1:15:06] uh
[1:15:09] now Moses is questioning here
[1:15:12] okay so I'm gonna go tell them
[1:15:15] but they're going to tell me
[1:15:17] that you're crazy Moses
[1:15:19] right
[1:15:21] the Lord hath not appeared unto thee
[1:15:24] so now Moses is looking for vindication
[1:15:28] I need something to vindicate what I'm
[1:15:30] going to say
[1:15:31] I need Vindication to my message I need
[1:15:33] Vindication to my calling I need
[1:15:35] Vindication Amen to the commission
[1:15:39] ain't that right
[1:15:41] and the Lord said unto him what is in
[1:15:44] thine hand
[1:15:46] and he said a rod
[1:15:48] and he said cast it on the ground
[1:15:51] now you know what the prophet said it
[1:15:53] wasn't good in Moses's hand
[1:15:55] he had to let it go
[1:15:58] and when he let it go it becoming God's
[1:16:00] hands
[1:16:02] cast it to the ground and it became a
[1:16:05] serpent
[1:16:06] now I I wish we'll get more into it
[1:16:09] hopefully Lord willing and Moses fled
[1:16:11] from it from before it and the Lord said
[1:16:14] unto Moses put forth thine hand and take
[1:16:16] it by the tail and he put forth his hand
[1:16:18] and caught it and it became a rod in his
[1:16:21] hand
[1:16:22] now now now now Moses was not performing
[1:16:26] magicians
[1:16:28] Magic
[1:16:30] God was in that rod
[1:16:33] that Rod was speaking of another Rod to
[1:16:36] come
[1:16:38] and you say man now see the prophet said
[1:16:41] the power laid in the rod
[1:16:44] amen
[1:16:46] now look Exodus 4 17 God said to him
[1:16:49] Thou shalt take this rod in thine hand
[1:16:53] wherewith Thou shalt do signs
[1:16:57] ain't that right don't forget the rod
[1:17:00] Moses
[1:17:01] because that's what you're going to do
[1:17:02] signs with
[1:17:04] don't don't forget to take it and don't
[1:17:06] you just look at it as just some old
[1:17:08] stick that's what's going to be your
[1:17:09] your vindication
[1:17:12] ain't that right
[1:17:14] Exodus 7 and 8 and the Lord spake unto
[1:17:18] Moses and unto Aaron saying now see
[1:17:20] they're already down into Egypt when
[1:17:23] Pharaoh shall speak unto you saying show
[1:17:25] a miracle uh for you then Thou shalt
[1:17:28] sand there and take thy rod and cast it
[1:17:31] before pharaoh and it shall become a
[1:17:33] serpent and Moses and Aaron went in unto
[1:17:36] pharaoh and they did as so as the Lord
[1:17:39] had commanded and Aaron cast down his
[1:17:41] Rod before pharaoh and before servants
[1:17:44] and it became a serpent ain't that right
[1:17:47] in Exodus 7 17 God says I will Smite
[1:17:51] with the rod that is in my hand upon the
[1:17:55] waters which are in the river and they
[1:17:57] shall be turned to blood Exodus 8 and 5
[1:18:01] the Lord spake unto Moses saying to
[1:18:04] Aaron stretch forth thine hand with thy
[1:18:07] rod over the streams over the rivers
[1:18:10] over the ponds and calls frogs to come
[1:18:12] up upon the land of the Egypt and Aaron
[1:18:16] stretched out his hand over the Waters
[1:18:19] of Egypt and the frogs came up and
[1:18:21] covered the land of Egypt Exodus 8 and
[1:18:25] 16 and the Lord said to Moses say unto
[1:18:28] Aaron stretch out thy rod and smite the
[1:18:30] dust of the lamb and then become lice
[1:18:33] throughout all the land of Egypt and
[1:18:35] they did so see and and for Aaron
[1:18:38] stretched out his hand with his rod and
[1:18:40] smote the dust of the earth and it
[1:18:42] become lice in man and in Beast all the
[1:18:46] dust of the land became lice throughout
[1:18:49] all the land of Egypt
[1:18:51] my God showing what a rod will do
[1:18:56] can you say Amen
[1:18:57] that's right see you see the Holy Ghost
[1:19:00] is the power of God that's been given to
[1:19:03] the church
[1:19:04] do you believe that you know what the
[1:19:06] prophet said if those Egyptians could
[1:19:09] have gotten that Rod out of Moses's hand
[1:19:11] out of his possession they would have
[1:19:13] whipped him
[1:19:15] but as long as Moses had that Rod there
[1:19:19] was a supernatural Vindication with him
[1:19:24] that's right
[1:19:26] you know what else the prophet said he
[1:19:28] says what that stick was in the hand of
[1:19:30] Moses
[1:19:32] the same is the name of Jesus to the
[1:19:34] church
[1:19:37] can you say Amen
[1:19:38] where you can say get away from there
[1:19:40] and it's gone
[1:19:42] ain't that right see so Mark 16 17 Jesus
[1:19:46] said and these signs shall follow them
[1:19:48] that believe in my name they shall cast
[1:19:50] out Devils shall speak with new tongues
[1:19:53] they shall take up serpents and if they
[1:19:55] drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt
[1:19:57] them they shall shall lay hands on the
[1:20:00] sick and they shall recover
[1:20:03] what is it it's the name of Jesus
[1:20:06] amen he says if the church will hold
[1:20:09] that name of Jesus East esteem it and
[1:20:13] honor it and quit using it in slang and
[1:20:17] so forth and use it in power and
[1:20:19] reverence it'll conquer every enemy that
[1:20:23] God's God on the Earth
[1:20:25] my
[1:20:27] the rod
[1:20:29] I Rod thy staff they comfort me
[1:20:35] you see Moses with that Rod changed all
[1:20:38] nature
[1:20:40] he changed nature
[1:20:42] Prophet said he did it to make it work
[1:20:44] for him
[1:20:47] why
[1:20:48] it was time for deliverance
[1:20:52] and the people began to see the
[1:20:54] supernatural that was with Moses
[1:20:57] everything he did was with that rod
[1:21:01] ain't that right
[1:21:04] he took that rod with him when they went
[1:21:06] out into the wilderness
[1:21:09] when he got up to that Red Sea
[1:21:12] the Egyptian Army behind them
[1:21:15] it looked like they were trapped
[1:21:18] it'll look like God had led him into a
[1:21:20] death trap but God didn't forget the rod
[1:21:25] and when Moses Cried unto God God said
[1:21:28] what is it in your hand
[1:21:30] stretch it forth and when Moses
[1:21:33] stretched that Rod forth the waters
[1:21:35] opened up and they walked on dry ground
[1:21:39] brother Brown said that that Rod was a
[1:21:41] judgment rod
[1:21:43] to Egypt ain't that right
[1:21:46] so he said see look at that Shepherd's
[1:21:49] gold
[1:21:50] that staff that Rod making a way for
[1:21:53] them to go that stick was in the
[1:21:55] shepherd's hand it bypassed every bit of
[1:21:58] Theology and all the things the
[1:22:00] priesthood said and that Shepherd's Rod
[1:22:03] LED them right down through every
[1:22:05] impossible thing known to man
[1:22:09] it was the rot ain't that right when
[1:22:12] Pharaoh tried to think that the
[1:22:13] cataracts erupted in the mountains and
[1:22:15] throw the water and then made it turn
[1:22:17] into blood see that was that was
[1:22:19] Pharaoh's thinking he was using the
[1:22:21] science and the reasoning and all that
[1:22:23] oh that wasn't really a trick there or
[1:22:25] Supernatural it was this and this and
[1:22:27] this just like people try to explain
[1:22:28] Miracles today you can explain miracles
[1:22:33] God just does it
[1:22:37] so here he is trying to explain these
[1:22:39] things and then the prophet said then
[1:22:41] God rained fire out of heaven
[1:22:44] gonna shut that reasoning up
[1:22:47] and then he reigned hell out of Heaven
[1:22:49] he reigned lice upon the Earth and
[1:22:51] everything else and he did it by the
[1:22:54] shepherd's staff
[1:22:57] not my textbook
[1:22:59] not by theologians idea
[1:23:02] but by Shepherd's staff
[1:23:05] he said it was a shepherd's Rod guiding
[1:23:08] his sheep making the way clear as they
[1:23:10] went towards the promised word in the
[1:23:12] land
[1:23:13] what a beautiful thing that is today of
[1:23:15] the shepherd's staff today guiding a
[1:23:18] sheep to the promised land bypassing all
[1:23:21] Theology and everything else of this
[1:23:22] world and the things of the world and
[1:23:25] the denominations and everything opening
[1:23:27] up the way aren't you glad God's still
[1:23:30] opening up the way
[1:23:31] amen when it looks like you're trapped
[1:23:33] when it looks like you've done
[1:23:34] everything you can and the enemy's going
[1:23:36] to swallow you up God still has a rod in
[1:23:40] this day to open the way for his people
[1:23:46] he's opening up the way and proving his
[1:23:48] word to be the truth see it's the
[1:23:51] shepherd's staff going ahead and he
[1:23:54] delivered the people out of Egypt with
[1:23:58] the staff in his hand and he guided the
[1:24:02] Sheep to the promised land and sent
[1:24:05] judgment Amen to the land that they left
[1:24:11] see that Rod was used as a vindication
[1:24:16] the Moses message of Deliverance
[1:24:19] God made his presence known by that rod
[1:24:24] can you say Amen
[1:24:27] showing that it wasn't just a man coming
[1:24:29] another preacher another another teacher
[1:24:31] another Theologian another goofball
[1:24:33] another you understand another Jim Jones
[1:24:36] or another uh uh David whatever that was
[1:24:40] out in uh uh you know
[1:24:43] all of these things yet God would prove
[1:24:47] to the people that his message was sent
[1:24:49] from God
[1:24:51] can you say amen
[1:24:53] amen see and he came he came see now now
[1:24:57] Church in this age we know it and and so
[1:25:01] so sometimes we just let it let it let
[1:25:04] it become common but God not only sent
[1:25:08] us a prophet to restore us back to what
[1:25:14] was in the beginning
[1:25:16] but he has come himself
[1:25:19] as the Vindication of what the prophet
[1:25:23] said to be the truth
[1:25:27] can you say Amen
[1:25:29] and if I can say it this way he the rod
[1:25:33] he the shepherd staff
[1:25:36] oh yeah he can become all things hitting
[1:25:38] the all things
[1:25:40] in all things he has the preeminence
[1:25:43] ain't that right he's the shepherd
[1:25:46] he's the lamb
[1:25:48] he's the staff
[1:25:50] he's the priest
[1:25:52] he's the rod
[1:25:54] he's everything that you need
[1:25:57] can you say Amen
[1:25:59] now notice he's come himself in this day
[1:26:02] and this means something to us because
[1:26:04] you know I
[1:26:08] um just thinking
[1:26:11] is stalking you know um
[1:26:14] some of you young people you may get out
[1:26:16] into work
[1:26:18] and it's out there in the work Workforce
[1:26:20] that you you begin to realize that not
[1:26:23] everybody believes the message
[1:26:26] and they've got all kinds of ideas
[1:26:29] thoughts
[1:26:34] one was telling my daughter
[1:26:38] the other day that
[1:26:40] that there were giants in the land or
[1:26:43] Giants way before Adam and Eve
[1:26:46] and he began to tell how all the things
[1:26:49] that he's been studying the books and
[1:26:51] this and that and said what books do you
[1:26:53] read
[1:26:55] said well we followed the message
[1:26:56] William Branham
[1:27:00] but see there's there's so much
[1:27:03] eagerness to learn
[1:27:06] no doubt that they they're good
[1:27:08] Christian they they is what they know
[1:27:10] they they love God in in their own way
[1:27:12] but that's not what's going to take a
[1:27:14] rapture
[1:27:18] and and and so but but I I was I was
[1:27:22] talking to her and I said but aren't you
[1:27:25] glad
[1:27:27] that in the middle of all these
[1:27:29] questions and everybody's question the
[1:27:31] questioning about their Holiness
[1:27:33] questioning about their long hair or
[1:27:34] questioning about you know why are you
[1:27:36] wearing your skirts and well I don't
[1:27:38] believe it's this way and I don't think
[1:27:40] it's this way and everybody's got their
[1:27:42] own answers but but but you know when it
[1:27:44] all comes down to it there's got to be
[1:27:46] one answer that's right and everything
[1:27:47] else is wrong
[1:27:49] ain't that right and yet I'll do all the
[1:27:52] reading and all these things we're still
[1:27:54] not searching we're we we you know there
[1:27:56] are people that give their lifetime of
[1:27:59] of searching and theologies and and one
[1:28:02] Seminary and book after book after book
[1:28:04] church after church after church going
[1:28:07] from this and this and this and yet
[1:28:09] they're still searching
[1:28:11] but we have found something that we have
[1:28:13] stopped searching
[1:28:15] it's been a message but it's not just a
[1:28:18] man with a message writing another book
[1:28:20] it's been a God that has come as the rod
[1:28:23] and staff and Vindicated it the
[1:28:26] supernatural has come in this age
[1:28:31] and you say Amen
[1:28:33] I hope that's all right
[1:28:35] but see there cannot be the prophet said
[1:28:37] there cannot be the presence of God
[1:28:39] without Supernatural things happening
[1:28:40] never did Jehovah appear without the
[1:28:43] supernatural following him it has to be
[1:28:46] he's always have Vindicated himself that
[1:28:49] he was with these prophets by confirming
[1:28:51] that what they were prophecy prophesying
[1:28:54] of if it was according to his word can
[1:28:57] you say Amen so we have seen that this
[1:28:59] message is according to the word by the
[1:29:02] Vindication of God night after night day
[1:29:05] after day God is so Vindicated this
[1:29:08] message to take away all of our
[1:29:09] questions
[1:29:11] amen
[1:29:15] and if you notice
[1:29:16] David said that he's walking in the
[1:29:18] Valley of the shadow of death
[1:29:20] so he's not referring to the Millennium
[1:29:22] this isn't all going up when we get to
[1:29:24] the Millennium it's talking about now
[1:29:27] it's talking about the time amen present
[1:29:30] that that light and darknesses Associate
[1:29:32] together our presence sickness and
[1:29:34] health are present battles and victories
[1:29:37] are present all of these things are
[1:29:39] present and yet David would declare yet
[1:29:41] I will fear no evil for thou art with me
[1:29:47] thy rod and thy staff they comfort me
[1:29:54] no questions
[1:29:59] I hope it's making sense to you today
[1:30:03] no questions if we're not if we're going
[1:30:05] to make it
[1:30:07] we're going to make it
[1:30:09] no questions if I'm going to be
[1:30:11] destroyed in the in the trial
[1:30:13] there's no questions
[1:30:15] can you say Amen there's no questions
[1:30:18] whether I'm going to make it or not
[1:30:19] there's no questions why his staff and
[1:30:22] his Rod is here and it comforts me I see
[1:30:26] God Vindicated
[1:30:29] I see the Vindication of God that lets
[1:30:32] me know his presence is here
[1:30:34] can you say Amen
[1:30:36] I believe that this chapter you know
[1:30:38] this is just my thoughts I believe this
[1:30:42] chapter is is prophetic for our day in
[1:30:45] which we live we are living in the most
[1:30:47] evil age there ever was brother Branham
[1:30:50] describes this age as being real
[1:30:52] religious but Lawless not only lawless
[1:30:55] when it comes to Natural laws of the
[1:30:57] land but Lawless to God's Own laws women
[1:31:01] trying to be men men becoming more like
[1:31:03] women that you know and and women
[1:31:06] dressing like men act like men talking
[1:31:08] like men you know and all these things
[1:31:10] are getting away from the home life and
[1:31:12] and going to work like men and men are
[1:31:15] becoming more and more sissified and and
[1:31:18] and surrendering their position in the
[1:31:20] home and and and they they don't know
[1:31:22] how to leave they don't have no headship
[1:31:24] and see these are laws of God that God
[1:31:27] has placed can you say Amen he's placed
[1:31:29] laws in the Church of how a church
[1:31:31] should function and he's placed laws in
[1:31:33] the in in the land that all of these
[1:31:36] things but look at it even the laws of
[1:31:38] nature is getting all messed up
[1:31:43] ain't that right
[1:31:44] now if you notice we've read this before
[1:31:46] but Luke 21 25 and there shall be signs
[1:31:49] in the Sun and in the moon and in the
[1:31:51] stars and upon the Earth distress of
[1:31:54] nations with perplexities the Sea and
[1:31:56] the waves roaring men's Hearts failing
[1:31:59] them for fear is that not the day we're
[1:32:02] living in
[1:32:03] you know it is
[1:32:05] that that is prophecy of your day young
[1:32:07] people this day you could say this day
[1:32:10] this scripture is fulfilled you're not
[1:32:13] living in the age of your ancestors
[1:32:14] where they didn't know what this meant
[1:32:16] and looking for a day you're living in
[1:32:18] that day men's hearts are failing them
[1:32:21] for fear and for looking after those
[1:32:23] things which are coming upon the Earth
[1:32:25] for the powers of Heaven shall be shaken
[1:32:28] ain't that right but in the middle of it
[1:32:31] David says I will fear no evil for thou
[1:32:35] art with me oh my David has been
[1:32:39] confirmed or the presence of the Lord
[1:32:42] has been confirmed to David that he's
[1:32:45] there amen with him can you say amen and
[1:32:48] I believe as it was speaking of our day
[1:32:50] so is it now that the presence of God
[1:32:53] even though that was spoken as a
[1:32:55] prophetic I believe it is now that the
[1:32:58] presence of God has been confirmed amen
[1:33:01] that he's here with us
[1:33:04] I will fear no evil
[1:33:06] everybody say I will fear no evil I will
[1:33:09] fear no evil there's a generation whose
[1:33:12] heart is failing them for fear amen but
[1:33:15] I will fear no evil I'm living in the
[1:33:18] Valley of the shadow of death I'm living
[1:33:19] in the time amen where men's hearts are
[1:33:22] failing them amen for their fear of
[1:33:24] looking after the things that's coming
[1:33:26] what is coming tribulations coming God's
[1:33:29] Wrath is fixing to be poured out the
[1:33:31] plagues are being poured out but I will
[1:33:33] fear no evil for thou art with me thy
[1:33:37] rod and thy staff they comfort me
[1:33:41] [Music]
[1:33:45] that's right see knowing the Lord Is
[1:33:47] With Us takes away all fear
[1:33:49] why because we are his responsibility
[1:33:52] we're his sheep he's a shepherd we are
[1:33:55] his responsibility so he is our provider
[1:33:58] he is our sustainer our healer our
[1:34:01] refuge our peace
[1:34:02] ain't that right
[1:34:04] Luke 12 6 are not five sparrows Jesus
[1:34:08] saying the great Shepherd now listen
[1:34:09] he's saying are not five sparrows sold
[1:34:12] for too far farthings and not one of
[1:34:14] them is forgetting forgotten before God
[1:34:16] but even but even the very hairs of your
[1:34:20] head are all numbered
[1:34:23] do you realize that every time you lose
[1:34:25] your hair
[1:34:27] I hadn't lost much bro Junior amen but
[1:34:30] but any anytime you lose your hair
[1:34:33] they're numbered God knows that where
[1:34:35] they're at and the prophet already made
[1:34:38] the Declaration I've not lost to one
[1:34:41] can you say Amen wherever they went to
[1:34:44] they'll come back I'm going there
[1:34:48] ain't that right so he says see the even
[1:34:51] the very hairs of your head are all
[1:34:53] numbered fear not therefore ye are of
[1:34:58] more value than many sparrows Luke 21 17
[1:35:03] and you shall be hated of all men for my
[1:35:05] name's sake but there shall not be and
[1:35:08] hair of your hair head perish
[1:35:12] ain't that right so you know what that
[1:35:14] means to for us they can burn them to
[1:35:17] the stake bet your hair a hair of your
[1:35:19] head ain't gonna perish you can be put
[1:35:22] back into dust cremated put in the in be
[1:35:26] uh uh food for the sharks or whatever
[1:35:28] amen but a hair on your head will never
[1:35:32] perish showing that his care for us has
[1:35:36] an eternal quality
[1:35:40] Hallelujah
[1:35:43] and it's in the time
[1:35:45] that men's Hearts failing them for fear
[1:35:48] Jesus makes himself known to his church
[1:35:52] for here in the 27th verse Jesus already
[1:35:54] told us now in the preceding that men's
[1:35:57] Hearts failed him for fear now in the
[1:36:00] following verse he says then then shall
[1:36:03] they see the son of man coming in a
[1:36:06] cloud with power and great glory and
[1:36:08] when these things begin to come to pass
[1:36:11] what are we supposed to do what's our
[1:36:13] response look up
[1:36:15] look up lift up your head look up for
[1:36:20] your Redemption draweth nigh
[1:36:24] can you say amen and are we not living
[1:36:27] in the time of the Third Exodus
[1:36:30] God sent a prophet in this age to tell
[1:36:34] us get the token applied
[1:36:37] your Redemption is here
[1:36:42] and God is in his rod
[1:36:45] his Rod is with us
[1:36:48] to vindicate the message of the hour
[1:36:51] can you say Amen
[1:36:53] oh do you love him
[1:36:56] you know good and well this dissension
[1:36:58] is tied it's the dissension this coming
[1:37:00] that he says they shall see the son of
[1:37:02] man coming in a cloud with powering Rick
[1:37:04] Glory it's the descension of Our Lord
[1:37:06] that Paul spoke of in first
[1:37:07] Thessalonians 4 16. John wrote writes
[1:37:10] about in Revelations 10 and 1 it has to
[1:37:13] do with our Redemption he comes to claim
[1:37:15] what he has redeemed who our great
[1:37:20] Shepherd
[1:37:24] oh do you love him
[1:37:29] men's Hearts failing them for fear
[1:37:33] doesn't necessarily mean that they're
[1:37:35] just dropping dead
[1:37:37] but it means that they're losing their
[1:37:39] carriage
[1:37:41] they're losing faith
[1:37:44] they're losing their resolve
[1:37:49] they're failing brother Brian said faith
[1:37:51] will be real slow
[1:37:54] what is it why because they're not aware
[1:37:56] of God's presence
[1:37:58] can you say man
[1:38:00] as I get raid closed now
[1:38:03] first uh
[1:38:05] first Peter 5 8 you know fear is a great
[1:38:07] thing
[1:38:09] and he says be sober be vigilant because
[1:38:13] your adversary the devil as a roaring
[1:38:15] lion
[1:38:17] walketh about seeking whom he may devour
[1:38:21] and
[1:38:23] again I believe this is prophetic for
[1:38:25] our day
[1:38:27] that we're living in if there's ever a
[1:38:29] time or I'm I mean I know the devil's
[1:38:32] been walking around you know ever since
[1:38:36] well before he even got Eve he was
[1:38:38] walking in the garden
[1:38:39] and and these things but if if if it's
[1:38:44] ever a greater time it's the greatest
[1:38:46] time that he's at work is right now
[1:38:49] the lid of Hell uh uh has been the lid
[1:38:54] has been lifted off of Hills the prophet
[1:38:55] said demons are pouring in everywhere is
[1:38:58] invading the people ain't that right you
[1:39:02] see he's walking as a roaring lion
[1:39:04] seeking whom he may devour you know and
[1:39:07] and they say you know the brother Brown
[1:39:10] said they say if you're ever killed by a
[1:39:12] lion it's painless because he scares you
[1:39:15] to death before he gets to you
[1:39:18] ain't that right
[1:39:20] and I'm not saying that Satan is a line
[1:39:23] but the Bible does say he walking about
[1:39:25] as a roaring lion
[1:39:28] and and he's putting fear
[1:39:32] into the people
[1:39:34] fear
[1:39:36] in in in I I think we could all say that
[1:39:43] if fear ever grips us
[1:39:47] and God doesn't Deliver Us from that
[1:39:49] fear
[1:39:51] then the next step
[1:39:54] is out
[1:39:56] you can't believe God so you if brother
[1:39:59] bran talks about how people can't
[1:40:01] believe God because they're afraid he
[1:40:02] won't keep his word fear
[1:40:04] it's all fear
[1:40:06] ain't that right afraid fear that God
[1:40:08] don't love him fear that they're always
[1:40:11] going to be in The Valleys fear that the
[1:40:13] the the the the you know the Sun Ain't
[1:40:15] Gonna Shine for them fear that they're
[1:40:17] going to go to hell fear
[1:40:19] and then they say well what's the use
[1:40:21] then they give up and then they this and
[1:40:23] then they that they give in to
[1:40:24] everything but fear is the thing
[1:40:29] and so he's he's he's
[1:40:33] in stealing fear in the people and
[1:40:37] brother Adam said Satan is going about
[1:40:39] destroying mortal life
[1:40:41] and spiritual life
[1:40:45] see some people that just in their life
[1:40:48] that how many more lives have been ended
[1:40:50] spiritually
[1:40:53] and it's all the work of the devil
[1:40:57] and it starts with something it isn't
[1:41:00] just an immediate thing
[1:41:01] it's it's something
[1:41:04] and Satan projects something to us and
[1:41:06] it freezes
[1:41:07] the people
[1:41:10] listen to the news
[1:41:12] and they get shaken up
[1:41:14] instead of holding on to God's word
[1:41:16] they listen to the doctors
[1:41:19] incurable disease and they freeze up
[1:41:22] instead of just following God's word
[1:41:25] it's fear
[1:41:27] brother random says see people talk
[1:41:29] about devils and don't even know what
[1:41:31] they are sometime that's right but you
[1:41:33] run headlong into them every day
[1:41:36] he said maybe but you will notice see he
[1:41:40] said and after a while
[1:41:41] the devil was accusing me
[1:41:44] notice why he's saying you have no power
[1:41:46] with God
[1:41:49] you're just a bluff
[1:41:51] you have no power
[1:41:53] out of all the times
[1:41:56] Miracle after Miracle after miracle
[1:41:59] happened in brother Brown's Ministry and
[1:42:01] the devil's telling him this
[1:42:05] how many times have God blessed you and
[1:42:07] how many times have God rescued us out
[1:42:09] of our trials
[1:42:13] and then he gets us to a place where we
[1:42:15] get convinced again
[1:42:18] that there's no hope
[1:42:21] and fear grips us but notice what the
[1:42:24] prophet said Satan you are an offense to
[1:42:27] me
[1:42:28] get out of my way in the name of Jesus
[1:42:31] Christ and he left
[1:42:33] he said I laid there a bit in the bed
[1:42:35] and started to raise up and I felt a
[1:42:36] real sweet feeling come over me and as I
[1:42:39] wonder if the Holy Spirit now is close
[1:42:41] and over in the corner so help me here's
[1:42:43] my Bible over my heart the sweetest
[1:42:45] voice I ever heard in my life said Do
[1:42:47] Don't Fear to go anywhere
[1:42:50] and don't fear to do anything for the
[1:42:53] never failing presence of Jesus Christ
[1:42:56] is with you everywhere you go that
[1:42:59] settled it with me let them rage I've
[1:43:02] got an absolute my anchor holds Yonder
[1:43:04] because it's the word of the Living God
[1:43:07] can you say Amen this is exactly what
[1:43:10] David said I will fear no evil for thou
[1:43:14] art with me thy rod and thy staff they
[1:43:17] comfort me and I say to you the never
[1:43:19] failing presence of Jesus Christ is with
[1:43:22] this church it's with this bride it's
[1:43:25] with the people amen of God and he has
[1:43:29] shown forth his rod in this day
[1:43:33] vindicating this very message
[1:43:36] the prophet said the angel of the Lord
[1:43:38] accompanies this message always
[1:43:44] if the musicians will come
[1:43:46] brother Brown said the Holy Spirit has
[1:43:48] been bound by these denominational
[1:43:50] Rivers for almost 2 000 years
[1:43:53] but it is to be loosed by in the evening
[1:43:55] time by the evening time message
[1:43:58] the Holy Spirit back in the church again
[1:44:00] Christ himself revealed in human flesh
[1:44:03] in the evening time
[1:44:06] and he promised it
[1:44:08] and I say he's here
[1:44:10] can you say man do you love him
[1:44:13] can you lift your hands unto the Lord
[1:44:14] and worship him
[1:44:17] father we love you
[1:44:19] we thank you for your rod and staff
[1:44:23] thank you Lord that you are Our Shepherd

[1:44:37] you're with us Lord showing that your
[1:44:39] presence is here
[1:44:42] oh we thank you Father
[1:44:45] we thank you Lord for watching over your
[1:44:47] people
[1:44:49] halleluia Hallelujah

[1:44:57] greater is he that is in me
[1:45:01] then he that is in the world say it
[1:45:06] again
[1:45:07] greater is he that is in me
[1:45:12] greater is he that is in me
[1:45:17] greater is he
[1:45:19] [Music]
[1:45:25] well Satan's like
[1:45:29] roaring lion
[1:45:32] Roman to and from
[1:45:36] seeking whom he may devour
[1:45:40] the Bible tells me so
[1:45:44] and many Souls have been his prey to
[1:45:50] fall in some weak hour
[1:45:54] but God has promised us today
[1:45:59] is
[1:46:00] overcoming power and I say greater is he
[1:46:05] that is in me
[1:46:08] greater is sea that is in me
[1:46:11] [Music]
[1:46:14] Hallelujah
[1:46:16] [Music]
