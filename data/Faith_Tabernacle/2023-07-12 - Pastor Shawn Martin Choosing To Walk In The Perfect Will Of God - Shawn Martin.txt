uh just done a wonderful job and the people seem to be blessed and so we're we're thankful for that for that's that's what it's about amen and uh just a wonderful group of people and brother Diego asked me to to greet you all amen and so um uh before we go into the word may we just bow our head and just talk to the Lord and ask his help father we know that you are a conqueror you're the mighty conqueror Victorious Lord and father because of this we have our faith in you we're under great expectation father no doubt that Satan has fought your people today and been warring upon them Lord maybe in the Physical Realm spiritual Realm the Lord we're asking you to come Among Us Lord that you would defeat the Devil tonight Lord and drive every spirit that is not like you away from the people father help us to believe father and I pray Lord that you would just Lift us up into a Heavenly Realm draw was closer to you father and what little words we would have I pray that you would multiply them and Lord let it sink into every Heart Lord Lord we give this service to you now in Jesus Christ's name and the church says amen and amen the uh I want to just read the 12th chapter of the book of Colossians I'm not good at these names so if I miss it Miss say it you just forgive me but Colossians the fourth chapter 12th verse it prefers who is one of you a servant of Christ saluteth you always laboring fervently for you in prayers that you may stand perfect and complete in all everybody say all in all the will of God amen you can have your seats this evening that you may stand perfect and complete in all the will of God and if I would have a a title um I guess it would be choosing to walk in the perfect will of God and last night just I don't know uh couldn't sleep but just asking the Lord you know what I could speak on uh that would be a beneficial be a help and woke up with this thought on my mind and and so it just kind of opened up to me and so we're just gonna talk about it but uh of course the will of God is the plan that God has uh for us where you in other words we're not we're not God doesn't want us to wonder aimlessly through life just you know bumping here and bumping there and just trying just going but he wants us to to he's got a plan and and and that plan is his will so then therefore as Believers we should all uh strive uh to know what is the will of God and then walk in that wheel and so uh as as we know throughout the Bible and and even in our personal walk that being in the will of God is where the peace of God Lays being in the will of God is where the blessings of God lay it's it's where the blessings are it's where that we can find rest is in in the will of God walking in that wheel now we we teach strongly on predestination we believe in predestination because the Bible teaches it and I'm going to go through several scriptures but to to talk about this for a moment but Ephesians 1 and 4 Paul would say according as he hath chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world so when did he choose you not when you come to an altar but he chose us in him before the foundation of the world way before the world ever began that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love aren't you glad for that now that's something that's that's predestinated having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will not my will not your will but his will to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he hath made us accepted in the Beloved so then we find that God predestinated it all according to his own will to the good pleasure and we've talked about it uh and that is that God could only predestinate by his foreknowledge ain't that right knowing in the beginning what would be now if you go on down to the ninth verse of Ephesians it says having made known unto us the mystery of his will so this this will was a mystery but it's made known to us according to his good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself that in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ both which are in heaven and which are on earth even in him ain't that right 11th verse in whom also we have obtained an inheritance being predestinated everybody say being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will so God has a will and from that wheel is a plan and is a purpose it but everything that God does is based off of his own will not our will ain't that right so then then we find uh again that that he he predestinated everything according to that that purpose and and and so notice God doesn't just know about our beginning and our end and uh but he has predestinated he has decreed it he has ordained it to be so he just didn't foresee you and and foreknow you and say well I I understand by my foreknowledge that they're going to be born at a certain time and and they're going to this is going to be their end over here because I can foresee it but he decreed it he declared it he he ordained it ain't that right so so your salvation is predestinated and ordained of God do you believe that you being in heaven is not by chance but it's predestinated or ordained of God every person that is going to go in the rapture is not going to be there by chance it is predestinated it is ordained God decreed it from the beginning ain't that right sitting at the marriage supper at that table at the marriage supper of the Lamb it everyone that is going to be there isn't there by chance it isn't that God will look at us and say oh you made it wow okay wow yeah no he decreed it he predestinated it so you couldn't miss it if you had to right because he it's it's according to his purpose his will ain't that right so so he knew our beginning he decreed it and he also decreed the end for here Jeremiah 29 11. it says for I know the thoughts that I think towards you saith the Lord thoughts of peace and not of evil to give you an expected end ain't that right aren't you glad you got unexpected in we may not know that in in our own mind but God's already declared that him to be you couldn't lose if you had to ain't that right and and this is why Satan cannot do anything to to tear us down he cannot destroy us because God has predestinated us now Isaiah 46 and 9 it says God's speaking remember the former things of old I for I am God and there is none else I am God and there is none like me declaring the end from the beginning from ancient times the things that are not yet done he's already declared it saying my counsel shall stand and I will do all my pleasure I will do all my will ain't that right so yes our Salvation comes by faith ain't that right and yes our healing comes by faith are being in the rapture it comes by faith for the prophet even told us that you've got to have its rapturing faith that you got to possess all of these things come by faith ain't that right the Bible even tells us that the just shall live by faith ain't that right but how can a man believe unless he's predestinated to belief ain't that right see so brother Branham after preaching on the end time signed seed I believe in 62 uh uh says to the audience if you're not right with God if there's something in you won't let you believe this Bible to be the inspired word of God you could not believe uh um that you could live according to its rules would you do so much as just raise your hand and say God be merciful I want you to pray for me brother Branham that I'll be that kind of a Christian are you here raise your hands and he says thank you young lady thank you God bless you all right there's one person in the building that thinks that see two of them that thinks that he says now I'm not one of these persons to persuade if the word can't move it you can only do it as you're predestinated to believe it ain't that right he said you remember although Jesus done so many miracles the Pharisees couldn't believe it they couldn't get it in their head because they wasn't to be that way ain't that right so see there there is a predestinated plan there's a predestinator which tells us that God is in control that God is is working everything after he is on Wheel his own purpose now acts 13 and 46 it says then Paul and bartimus uh wax bold and said it was necessary that the word of God should first have been spoken to you but seeing you put it from you and judge yourselves Unworthy of everlasting life Lo we turn to the Gentiles so so see they're talking to the Jews the Jews have turned it down so he said we're going to turn to the Gentiles for so hath the Lord commanded us saying I have set thee to be a light of the Gentiles that thou shouldest be for salvation unto the ends of the Earth and when the Gentiles heard this they were glad and glorified the word of the Lord and as many everybody's saying this many as were ordained to eternal life believed ain't that right not one less not one more but as many as were predestinated decreed ordained to eternal life they're the ones that believed so a man must be ordained even even uh ordained to eternal life if he in order for him to to believe ain't that right so again God could ordain men to eternal life by his foreknowledge as we said it we'll say it again for everyone's sake is that God did not look let's say he takes two people and says I Choose You and I don't choose you I'll send you to heaven and send you to Hell first of all God doesn't send anyone to hell they they send their own selves to hell but see God by foreknowledge he could already see and know what would be therefore he would ordain and predestinate according to his will hey ain't that right see so he can ordain men to destruction by his foreknowledge as well as for ordained men to eternal life by his foreknowledge well we look at Jude three there are certain men tripped on in unawares who were before of old ordained to this condemnation ungodly men ain't that right see why how did God why would God do that is he already foreknew what would be ain't that right he knew that if these men would come to the Earth they would not accept the the Salvation they would not accept the the the the the provided way that God would have they would actually despise it and turn it down and become exactly what they are ain't that right so there are certain men crept in unawares who were before a vote ordained to this condemnation ungodly men turning the grace of our God into lasciviousness and denying the only Lord God and our Lord Jesus Christ now so God did not allow them or they weren't born on this Earth and then all of a sudden they turned down the grace of God they they they they they made the grace of God as in some uh horrible thing uh uh and then God is surprised that they've done this no God already knew that they would do it ain't that right yes sir see he knew that so God knew by his foreknowledge who would accept salvation and who would not ain't that right so God isn't wasting his time uh uh trying to get everybody saved he already knew who would and who wouldn't be saved but yet according to his foreknowledge he could work out all things according to his will ain't that right now let's look at Romans 9 and 9. for This Is The Word of Promise at this time uh this is God speaking uh at this time will I come and Sarah shall have a son and not only this but when Rebecca also had conceived by one even by Our Father Isaac see Rebecca had twin boys right uh uh uh Esau and Jacob for the children them children not yet being born neither having done any good or evil see manifesting upon this Earth good works or bad works or whatever but that the purpose of God according to election might stand not of works but of him that calleth it was said unto her the elders Shall Serve the younger as it is written Jacob have I love but Esau have I hated what shall we say then is there unrighteousness with God God forbid for he saith to Moses I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion so then it is not of him that willeth nor of him that runeth but of God that showeth Mercy for the scripture sayeth unto Pharaoh even for the same purpose have I raised thee up that I might show my power in thee and that my name might be declared throughout all the Earth well let me ask you was Pharaoh a preacher was he was he a leader in in in in in the gospel absolutely not he was a heathen King that that gave Israel a hard time that despised Moses's message ain't that right and yet God says but I've raised thee up for this purpose that my glory might be revealed in thee ain't that right see so Pharaoh had a part to play in God's plan ain't that right so he says God goes on in the eighth tenth verse therefore uh or Paul would say therefore hath he Mercy on whom he will have mercy and whom he will he hardness well that will say unto me then why does he yet find fault uh uh for who hath resisted his will the will of God Nate but o man who art thou that replyest against God shall the thing formed say to him that formed it why hast Thou made me thus hath not the Potter power over the clay of the same lump to make one vessel unto honor and another unto dishonor what if God willing to show his wrath and to make his power known endured with much long suffering the vessels of Wrath fitted to destruction can you say Amen see and that he might make known the glory or the riches of his glory on the vessels of Mercy which he had a four beforehand prepared unto Glory so God is in charge I'm going to believe God is in charge and everything that God does is right do you believe that amen that that's right see so you cannot question God as to why he done this and why he done that he does it according to his own will and he's righteous in his what he does ain't that right so by the foreknowledge of God there are vessels of Wrath who are fitted for Destruction and there are vessels of Mercy that he has beforehand prepared unto to glory amen that's right now let's look at Acts 2 and 22 ye men of Israel hear these words Jesus of Nazareth a man approved of God among you by Miracles and wonders and signs which God did by him in the midst of you as you ye yourselves also know him being delivered by the determinant counsel and foreknowledge of God God determined it would happen God foreknew it would happen and here now Jesus comes to Earth and everything that God foreknew would happen and declared would happen it happened and and and and and and so now he's telling these men amen that Jesus or God worked through him and and he done signs and wonders and miracles but you crucified him you you nailed him to the Cross you put him in the grave but it was all for ordained of God for God foreknew it ain't that right see so him being delivered by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God you have taken and by Wicked hands have crucified and slain ain't that right so then we go uh uh looking in in First Peter and I I'm wanting to say lay a foundation hopefully uh uh right fast but First Peter 1 and 1 Peter an apostle of Jesus Christ to The Strangers scattered throughout pontus Glacier uh Cappadocia Asia and bisnia something like that all these all these uh uh uh uh uh strangers scattered through these these places notice in the in the second verse he left everybody say elect according to what the fort knowledge of God the Father ain't that right so so we are elect according to the foreknowledge of God the Father a man see so now we know that God could have kept uh uh the the the evil men ungodly man these Wicked hands from uh uh being born uh but he didn't he could have kept Pharaoh from being born but he didn't he allowed it ain't that right he could have kept all of these things and and and the the question is so much is why why is there so much sin why is there so much evil why does bad things happen why why why do we have all of these things and of course everyone wants to blame God even those who don't even believe in God when bad things happen somehow there's a God all of a sudden and they want to blame him but but we find that there has to be a contrast there has to be a contrast it takes the night to show the day it takes death to show life it takes sorrow to show the joy and happiness it takes the mountains to show the valley it takes the bad times to show the good times ain't that right that's that's right see and everything outside of God is a creation ain't that right everything outside of God is a creation so we're gonna maybe if I could look at it this way is that God is in control of everything but he's not making everybody be something that they're not to be and you say man as I've said before God could not make pharaoh to be a a Moses neither could he make Moses to be a pharaoh God already foresaw what they would be before the foundation of the world that's why Jacob could not be an Esau and Esau could not be a Jacob God did not try to make them be what they were not to be hello so therefore knowing that they would be this he ordained a part for them in in time hello to to play his purpose and his will now we find that everything outside of God is a creation God is infinite and he is self-existent one so there is no one that created God God was always everything else is a creation of God so then we look at this Colossians 1 and 16 it says for by him who God where all things created that are in heaven that are in Earth whether they're visible or invisible whether they be Thrones or dominions or principalities or Powers all things everybody say all things we're created by Him and for him so there's not nothing that was created just by by chance there there was nothing just randomly created everything was created by Him and for him for he has planned for his will whatever he's desired everything was created so the good and the bad were created by Him and for him light and darkness was created by Him and for him God tells us uh in Isaiah 45 and 6 as to why he created both now listen to this God says that they may know from the rising of the son and from the West that there is none besides me I am the lord and there is none else then you say Amen that they may know now notice that he wants us to know that there is none no other God beside him that he is the only one and there's nothing else there ain't that right so what does he do he says I form the light and create Darkness I make peace and create evil I the Lord do all of these things why that you may know that I am the lord and there is none else can you say amen amen well that that's true and and and then you go Isaiah 54 and 16 God says behold I have created the Smith that bloweth the coals in the fire and that bringeth forth an instrument for his work and I have created the waster to destroy but notice what he says in the following verse no weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper every tongue that shall rise against thee in judgment Thou shalt condemn so he doesn't make the uh uh the good or the evil he doesn't he didn't create all of these things to destroy he created it that you may know that he is the god and that he's the only one can you say Amen see by his foreknowledge God knew what Satan would do and yet he created him by his foreknowledge God knew beforehand that Satan would cause men to fall and yet he created him you believe that the fall of Man was not a mistake the fall of Man Would did not leave God you know just a blindsiding god knew it would happen beforehand and yet he created God knew that Satan would bring sickness upon the Earth and yet he created him God knew that Satan would make us slaves uh uh his slaves and yet God created him God created Satan to be a contrast to what he himself is ain't that right Satan is a destroyer God is a builder Satan gives death God gives life ain't that right Satan works in the darkness God is light and he his works is light see so we find that that God needed something to contrast what he is for God Is A Healer do you believe that but he needs somebody to be sick so he could be Express himself as the Healer God is savior but he needed someone to be lost that he could show forth his power as a savior God is a mighty deliverer do you believe that that he needed somebody to need delivering somebody that would be bound amen and somebody to hold a power over his people that he could reach down and by the power of His Deliverance he could rescue them and now we know God as a deliverer ain't that right see so God has allowed the evil to exist so that he might show to his elect what he truly is and I say to you God is the only one he's still upon the throne we know him to be the mighty conqueror look at all the times that God has delivered you look at all the times that God has answered your prayer and he's healed you he's saved you he set you free and and all of these things isn't that wonderful amen but see as we wouldn't love God we wouldn't really know God for what he truly is if we didn't have our downside if we didn't have our mistakes we wouldn't know him as as one that could take a broken life and mend it all back over again but it took something to contrast what he was ain't that right see so God works everything after the Council of his own will and and Satan Satan cannot thwart the purpose of God or the plan of God do you believe that amen the Bible even says the foundation of God standeth Shore the Lord knoweth them that are his amen it's true does God give all men to repent he sure does but will all men repent absolutely not does that catch God by surprise no God already knew they wouldn't ain't that right so now this is what I'd like to speak on for a few more moments is even though we are the predestinated elect of God we all have a free will right predestination does not do away with free will and Free Will means that we have the right to choose to reject it's within us within our power to say I I want that and I don't want that that's why we have commercials today that's why you have your Billboards that's why you have all kinds of things ads trying to get you to choose their product they can't make you but if they can sway you enough [Music] to look at their product and say man that looks good I think I'll get it well they didn't make you do it you've done it on your own ain't that right now if God if if God didn't give us a free will then I honestly I think it would be pretty easy life would just be easy no choices to make no decisions not nothing of right and wrong to look at it would always just be right we would just be under the command of God just to do it the sun automatically Rises and sets because his creator made it happen and said to do so that the Stars just come out at night and they're hanging in the air by the power of God's word they ain't got no choice about it they just they're there ain't that right see but we we have to make choices so predestination does not mean that we get to just to coast along in life well I'm predestinated so bless God I got it made well that that's fine but it doesn't take away your battles it doesn't take away the Warfare it doesn't take away the fact that Satan's out to get you and you've got to be on your toes ain't that right see so it doesn't mean predestination doesn't mean that we can do do anything we want to do because in the end we are predestinated to go to heaven that that that's that's not what predestination is some people say well you know one saved always saved and and they use that as a disgrace for a license to sin well I can go out and smoke and commit adultery and listen to Old Country Music and do this and do that bless God I'm saved that's that's that's not what God meant about predestination [Music] ain't that right see he foreknew that you would make a choice to serving so again predestination is based on the foreknowledge of God God knew before we were born what we would choose therefore he could predestinate based off his foreknowledge but in this life everybody say in this life now we come into the reality God saw it in his mind but now in this life is where he saw that we would make our choice in this life we still have choices to make amen see so his predestination didn't take away our choice but he knew what choice we would make therefore he predestinated but now you've got to make them choices Deuteronomy 30 19 it says I call Heaven and Earth to record this day against you that I have set before you life and death right blessings and cursing therefore choose life yes yes it's yours to make he sets it before all of us life and death blessings cursings ain't that right see that thou that that both thou and thy seed may live that thou mayest love the Lord thy God see love is something that whelms within us by a free moral agency amen amen it's something that we can feel it's so that thou mayest love the Lord thy God and that thou mayest obey his voice and that thou mayest cleave unto him for he is thy life so he sets himself before you for he is thy life and the length of thy days choices Joshua told Israel choose you this day whom you're going to serve ain't that right so so setting this predestination aside that's what God done by foreknowledge we're going to look at us now we've got choices to make life or death blessings or cursings right and making choices is not easy it's not an easy thing to do to make the right choice and you young people teenagers especially are finding this out you see we do not arrive at the finish line I just told you I I just told you our destination the Rapture the body change sitting at the table at the marriage supper of the Lamb coming to our end and I believe we're here the church is coming to its end I believe we as our lives there ain't too much time left amen right but see we do not arrive at this Finish Line in the same condition that we were in at our birth when we reach the Finish Line we are reflecting Jesus Christ that's his purpose that's his will when we come to the Finish Line we are the manifestation of the sons of God When we arrive at this Finish Line we have perfect faith rapturing Faith right when we come to the Finish Line we have perfect love at the finish line or when we come to this Finish Line when we reach this Finish Line what are we we're capped with the Capstone when we come to the finish of our life see we we are matured wheat you believe that see something different than what we were at the beginning of our birth see we didn't start that way what we what we end up being is not what we started out being ain't that right for for and I hope this is okay but Psalms 51 5. David said uh behold I was shaping in iniquity and in sin did my mother conceive me as we said many times we came into this world speaking lies we we we were born with the carnal nature that was an enemy to God and this carnal nature could not be subject to the law of God could not come under the the God's headship ain't that right his word amen see we we were Rebels we had a nature to be a rebel we had a nature to go wrong all the time brother Brown said you take a child and you don't you don't teach him good or bad he'll take bad all the time every time because his nature so at at the very beginning of our birth we already had a bad start Satan already had a jump ahead over us in the sense that he we're in nature that would follow him we'd weak bite you know as a little kid never have to be taught you bite lie get mad throw Hissy Fits on and on and on because it was our nature to do so ain't that right so now notice though what the Apostle said in Romans 12 and 2. be not conformed to this world ain't that right look at that be not conformed to this world but yet we have everything within us to be conformed to this world everything about us wants to be conformed to this world our nature wants to be conformed to the world our our attitude wants to be conformed to the world our speech our eyes our hearing everything wants to be conformed to the world and you say Amen it leans to that way but yet here's a scripture that tells us don't be conformed to the world that's not God's will for you that's not God's plan for you but be ye transformed everybody say transformed see be transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God amen or somebody that's going to prove it ain't that right see we got we got today Christians so-called Christians there ain't no change in them there ain't nothing wrong uh that's happened in their lives Christians singing in the choir preaching behind the pulpit still smoking her cigarettes chewing their tobacco taking their social drinks then you say Amen see that autodimic nature trying to fit in in a religion or in Christendom but still being conformed to this world this word conformed because it says be not conformed to this world the word conform means to Fashion alike conform to the same pattern so every individual the Bible even says there's nothing new Under Heaven nothing why because every one of us is born with the adamic nature at Old carnal sinful nature we the only thing is it's getting more evil that old same nature that's that was in the generations uh uh uh in Jesus's time is the same nature today problem is we've made more room for sin it's more easier to sin got it on our phones got it on our computers got it on all these other things used to you couldn't look at pornography unless you went to an adult store now it's on the phone now it's in your home now it's wherever you want to go you can dig in as far as you want to go but what is it it's a sinful nature but here we're the Bible is telling us be not conformed to this world so then you know what that means he set before his life and deaths and you've got to make your choice choices are hard you see because it says be transformed and changed change from one thing to another change from a sinner to a saint changed right Earthbound Heaven bound changed transformed and this transformation happens by the choices you make hello you say oh it's going to happen by my predestination he predestinated you because he knew the choice you would make now you're here upon this Earth for a limited time to make your battles you're going to be tried and proven I hope it's all right see God sent his word by way of a Vindicated prophet and I pray to God that we've all made that choice to follow the message that he brought now notice notice we had a choice not to just listen to the message not just to listen to that prophet but we had to we had to make a choice with it Revelations 18 4 and I heard another voice from Heaven saying come out of her my people don't sit there and listen to it and then stay there and remain you've got to make your choice to come out can you say Amen come out of her my people that you being not partakers of her sins and that you receive none of her plagues do you realize that you're very my new people that have made their choice to come out there's thousands of people that have heard the same message and refused to come out that God knew you would make a choice that choice has cost you it has cost you family it's cost you popularity it's it's it's it's called names to be put upon you as an occult as a man follower and everything else but you made the choice to come out ain't that right now what if what what if we hadn't made the choice to come out would still be enslaved do the teachings and traditions of men there wouldn't have been a change take place within us but because we made the choice ain't that right that choice was hard when we heard about the Holy Ghost coming and living inside of men we had to make a choice to receive it or walk away from it I've known preachers that have seen Baptist preachers actually that were very well known among the native Indian people as a Baptist preacher he saw that the Holy Ghost was right he saw it he sat there and talked with my dad and and and and the pastor talk to him says I know you're it's right I want it but I can't because the church will kick me out see these choices Ain't Easy man tells us that the Holy Ghost is a good feeling or a sensation that you get but the prophet told us it's the life of God that comes inside of us now we had to make the choice either to take what man says what the Holy Ghost is or take what a prophet said the Holy Ghost is we had to make the choice do we stop with the sensation do we stop with a good feeling do we stop with the dance or do we go all the way until we know that we know that we know that we've got it not just on our spirit but on our inner soul can you say Amen Jesus said about the Holy Ghost in Acts 1 8 you shall receive power after that the Holy Ghost has come upon you and you shall be Witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem and in all Judea and Samara and unto the outermost parts of the earth ain't that right see you shall receive power no power until you get the Holy Ghost that right can't be Witnesses of him until you receive the Holy Ghost well what if we had made the choice to believe what men said about it there would have never been a transformation ain't that right what if we made the choice to walk away when we heard about the salvation that Jesus Christ had to offer where would we be what what what if we believed what man said about salvation you're saved when you join our denomination or saved when you shake the preacher's hand or or when you when you put your name up on on a on a card or a roll or you you repeat us a certain Creed right but something within our heart told us that what the Bible says about it is the truth and we accepted it repent be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ and you shall receive the the gift of the Holy Ghost that's the formula to Salvation see so we made our choice to believe the Bible and God knew you would make that choice all throughout our lifetime we will have to make choices I want to tell you young people this you're going to have to make your choices and as you're growing up you're realizing how difficult they are you're understanding what Mom and Dad and preacher and everyone had had to go through and we still have to make our choices no matter how old we are just because you follow chose to follow the message of this day doesn't mean that you can just Coast the rest of the way until you get to heaven and and I'll tell you why because the following scripture that I read to you gives this an example and that's in second Thessalonians 2 1. now we beseech you Brethren by the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and by our gathering together unto him that ye be that ye be not soon shaken in mind shaken or be troubled neither by Spirit nor by word nor by letter as from us as that the day of Christ is at hand let no man deceive you by any means [Music] for that day shall not come except there come a what Falling Away first and that man of sin be revealed the Son of Perdition so this tells us right away the people will start start out following what's truth start out following they'll go so far but then they're going to fall away right they make the choice to follow but somewhere in that choice it wasn't true then they start listening they make the choices start hanging around unbelievers start listening to this and start listening to that start listening to those that question and throw questions and they start trying to reason with it they start trying to and before you know it they for feeling exactly what God said they would they would fall away ain't that right so you you you cannot afford to Coast in First Corinthians 9 24 Paul explains it like this he says know ye not that they which run a race would run in a race run all all run everybody that's in that race is all are running but one everybody say one receive at the prize so run everybody say run run that you may obtain run not because your friends are running run not because everybody says it's a good thing to do run not because it's a sunny day run that you may obtain now notice what he says and every man that striveth for the Mastery is temperate in all things choices choices right every man that Strife is for the Mastery is temperate in all things now they do it to obtain a corruptable crown or a corruptable trophy something that they can put on their fireplace something they can put around their neck some kind of achievement of Ward but we do it for an Incorruptible crown a reward that's incorruptible a reward that will not fade away so we make our choices because we understand what we're striving for this word temperate means to exercise self-restraint and in this day this generation one thing they lack is self-restraint if it feels good they do it they want to do it they just do it and it's like they're Unleashed to do whatever they want no restraint but you got to have self-restraint when you're walking with God Amen because there's choices one might claim to be sealed with the Holy Ghost we understand Paul there in Ephesians 4 30 tells us that the holy spirit is a seal says grief not the holy spirit of God whereby you're sealed unto the day of redemption but I will say this God will not give someone the Holy Ghost that ain't going to obey his word he doesn't do it by chance he doesn't do it half-blind it's not a blind date it's not guesswork well I'll give him the Holy Ghost and see what happens him by foreknowledge knew can you say man therefore he predestinated to give you the Holy Ghost and we know what the Holy Ghost is for Jesus said in John 16 13 how be it when he the spirit of Truth the Holy Spirit when he the spirit of Truth has come he will guide you into all truth now is there everything you're going to know is all truth no you're going to hear all kinds of reports if if it'd be it'd be nice if we just had blinders like the horse does you know they put them blinders on a horse so they can keep better control of him so I ain't looking to the left and ain't looking to the right he ain't seen all the glamor and all these things so we can keep him straight on track but for us Satan shows us everything that's out there amen you heard the truth now you're going to hear a bunch of lies that sound like truth you heard the truth now you're gonna you're gonna you're gonna you're gonna see these enticing spirits that are all around and you have to make the choice you have to make the choice the Holy Ghost will be the one to lead you and and if you have the Holy Ghost you will be led but they that have the Holy Ghost will have to make choices to walk in all truth you have to make choices you believe that can you say that with me I have to make choices to walk in all truth it isn't just hand it to me truth is given to you but you have to make the choice to walk in all truth you have to make that choice to pray you have to make that choice to dedicate you have to make that choice to concentrate your life to God you have to make these choices all right come on man look Amos 3 3 can two walk together except they be agreed you know what he's telling you you cannot walk two people cannot walk together except they be agreed husband and wife cannot walk together except they be agreed it's true got to be an agreement second Corinthians 6 14 be not be ye not unequally yoked with unbelievers for what Fellowship haths righteousness with unrighteousness what communion has light with darkness and what Concord hath Christ with Belial or what part has he that believeth with an Infidel what agreement hath the temple of God with Idols for you are the Temple of the Living God as God has said I will dwell in them and walk in them and I will be their God and they shall be my people wherefore come out from among them and be separate saith the Lord and don't touch that unclean thing and I will receive you and you say Amen so we have to make the choices the word of God which is the will of God is set before us and then we choose to walk in that and again I may be repeating myself but just because God foreknew what choice we would make does it mean that our choices will be easy to make see we are a human and have a carnal sinful nature that we have to deal with I'm going to try to hurry but Romans 7 14 and I I trust you're listening to me and hope we're getting it to you but Romans 7 14 for we know that the law is spiritual but I am carnal sold under sin for that which I do I allow not for what I do that I do not or that I that do I not but what I hate that I do if then I do that which I would not I can send them to the law that is good now then it is no more I that do it but sin that dwelleth in me brother Branham interprets this scripture to be he says in other words Paul is saying in me are two persons one wants to do right and the other one wants me to do wrong every time I start to do right wrong hinders me have you ever had that we all struggle with it and I know you young people you struggle with it you may not understand everything that that is going on well Paul is telling you you say well I thought I had the Holy Ghost well you can have the Holy Ghost but it doesn't take away your choices it doesn't and he's telling you here that it does not it does not make you a total if you you know you forgive me if if you don't agree but it doesn't make you a total God man you still got a human element about you [Music] you got to deal with your human nature you got to deal with your human desires if if we had none of that there would be no Temptations there would be no trying of our faith there would be nothing there we'd just be like God and and and nothing to be tempted right so brother Brandon goes on he says you are an outward man which is controlled by six senses which we know he corrects that later five senses you are an inward man controlled by one sense which is Faith and this Faith disagrees with all five senses if the five senses doesn't agree with faith but one is contrary to the other as long as the five senses agree with the faith wonderful seeing the five senses smell taste fill here see a thing I got it all see that's that's what this is your five senses but then if they disagree with that sense of faith then then don't listen to your five senses he said one is contrary to the other he says but when the five senses disagrees with faith then leave the five senses alone now for instance here Jesus made a statement a promise the inside man says that's true God makes that statement he makes a promise the inside man says that's right that's true the outman outside man reasons and says it cannot be true to you then then ignore the outside man and accept the Insight man make that choice now that's the same thing that Paul's speaking of he was sold under the law to carnal sin every one of us is the same way that's the reason we have troubles the way we do of married four or five times and this and that and all kinds of sin and adulches and everything else along in our lives is because of those things we are carnal and that part must perish and then inside we are a spirit Man soul inside see and that's faith in God's word then we bring our outside body under subjection to the word by Faith by accepting what God Said God make that choice how can I take a Cocker Burr and make a grain of wheat out of it it's impossible for for me to do it the only way it can be done is because inside that cocklebur has been transmitted from cockleberry wheat uh a word to it uh cockle bird to a germ called we laugh then you bury that cocklebur it'll produce a grain of wheat because there has been a life of wheat put in that Cocker bar and the life of the kookabur has been taken out but the nature of that cocklebur is still sticky and it will be until this new life has fully been developed out of the ground and raised up again when it comes forth it then it's no more a cockle bird but a wheat but while it's here on Earth see and in out of the earth and the caucouper it's still sticky but it's got the nature of the inside of it the of Wheat and as long as you're in this life you're going to be sticky and have a carnal nature that's bothering going to bother you as long as you live but the inside of you you're born again and when you're raised up you're in the likeness of Christ and all the sin is gone from you ain't that right brother Graham talks about that Indian chief that got converted and after a while uh you know later on someone asked that Indian chief you know how he's doing he said well me good and me bad and he said well what does that supposed to mean he said well I got I got like two dogs you know uh uh fighting Within Me one's a white dog and one's a black dog and oh really you know and he said well well who's who's winning Chief and he's well that all depends what I feed the most yeah whatever dog I'm feeding then then that's what's going to overcome that's what's going to rule me are you with me now yes sir see so so you having the Holy Ghost you cannot just feed off of anything and grow in a spiritual Realm you cannot grow yet no we're striving at the end to be just like him but you've got to make choices amen now to get there [Applause] gotta make them choices having a problem with your phone get off the stupid phone I know the world's got it all set up he's got traps for us he's got all kinds of traps to get us away from the real thing that in the reality we are Christians and we must live like Christians choose talk whatever like Christians now see so brother Branham he says see that's a good answer it depends on which one you cater to which nature you cater to the Nate the carnal nature after the things of the world or the spiritual nature after the things of God see so there is always a wrestling and I I'm gonna let you go here but there's always a wrestling when it comes to us choosing to walk in the will of God and yet and yet you are a predestinated son and daughter of God think of that yeah and yet as a predestinated Son of God I've still wore Within Me that God already knew that I would overcome but he didn't take the battles away from me he didn't take the struggles away from me but by his foreknowledge he saw that I'd make them choices he saw that I would wrestle it out you say man we find Jesus was predestinated to be what he was the Lamb of God he was predestinated to do what he did but you know what he had to wrestle it out he had to surrender his own will to the will of the father that's right you believe that remember when he said there in Luke 22 and and uh says that when he was at the place he said unto them his disciples pray that ye enter not into temptation and he was withdrawn from them about a stone's cast and kneeled down and prayed and sang father if thou be willing remove this cup from me you talking about a struggle if you're willing remove this thing from me nevertheless not my will but thine be done and there appeared an angel from unto him unto him from Heaven strengthening him and being in an Agony he prayed more earnestly think of that now he didn't just get up it wasn't a five-minute prayer he was wrestling it out being in agony he prayed more earnestly and his sweat was as it were great drops of blood falling down to the ground brother Brown said it was one of the most greatest victories that Christ ever won or proved his great Messiah ship as when he said to God not my will but thine be done that was the greatest Victory he ever won all the Demons of Torment around him to tempt him and to try him but he overcome made the choice amen Galatians 1 4 Paul says speaking of Christ that he gave himself for our sins that he might Deliver Us from this present evil War evil world according everybody say according to the wheel of God and our father so he had to he had to wrestle it out the Apostle Paul he told us that he was called from his mother's womb to preach the gospel to the Gentiles he he was he he was called to be an apostle of Jesus Christ through the will of God in other places he said and then he tells us I Die daily I Die daily so it was a constant choice it was a constant Warfare he didn't Coast one of the greatest men uh uh in the in in in the church ages uh uh to set the the foundation and and every man after that all the Angels seven angels after that had to build according to that he placed that and it looked like his life would have been easy him knowing that he was an apostle uh by the will of God him knowing what he was called to do and yet he had the war and wrestle it out on a daily basis but you know God knew he would do that I believe that God makes it clear very clear to us what is death and what is life I believe that I believe that God makes it clear to us as to what his will is for us but our sticky nature gets in the way many times and causes us not to see the will of God clearly our own Ambitions our own desires our own Cravings that that that human side of us we know what the will of God is but our own ambitions this whole flesh causes us not to see clearly [Music] we know we know we shouldn't do it sure looks good and we'll explain every reason why we should do it and it's because we've not died to ourself I want to say this that not every decision that we make is going to be the right one sometimes we get ahead of God and we do our own thing instead of waiting on him to work things out oftentimes we get so carnal that we yield to our own lusts instead of yielding ourselves to God in these times that God corrects us we find ourselves if we could set this way on our backside high and dry the blessings of God ain't there the anointing of God isn't there it's kind of like Abraham when he went left the the Homeland and went down to Egypt he backslid Prophet said he showed him back he was backslidden leaving the Homeland to go down to Egypt got himself in trouble did he not now the prophet said see he shouldn't have been in Egypt but he went but he did not lose the Covenant he lost the blessings of the Covenant while he was in Egypt didn't you say man no it was a mistake but God spared him did he not he spared Sarah's life he spared him and brought him back but he got himself in the heap of trouble many times by us making the wrong decisions we lose the blessings of the Covenant but we don't lose the Covenant and then our failures the blood of Jesus has been provided as an atonement for us the prophet said now you will do wrong but you don't do it willfully you're trapped and anything you're trapped into or do something that you don't mean to do it it's not sin yet you'll repent the minute you see that you're wrong and you'll turn quickly and say I didn't mean it I didn't see that you'll say that all through life men don't want to be that's the reason we're so stupid and so and dark down here on Earth that there's a blood atonement for us all the time to keep us covered I mean thank God for the blood I thank God for the blood that I want to say it this way that doesn't mean to say well then shoot I'm just going to live my life and the blood of Christ still covers me you'll pay for every mistake you make can I say that again you're going to pay for the mistakes we pay for our disobediences Galatians 6 and 7 says be not deceived God is Not mocked for whatsoever man soweth that shall he also reap for he that soweth to his flesh shall reap of the flesh reap corruption but he that soweth through the spiritual of the spirit reap everlasting life amen amen now sometimes we may have to pay a great price for the decisions we make but I want to tell you and I I pray to God that the Lord will just help plant these in in your spirit your soul but our decisions can set us back in God our progress it can hurt our ministry it can hurt our influence with people it can hurt us in the kingdom of God by our decisions that's why we we can't just float along in life our decisions can be a detriment to us in our work for the kingdom of God most of all our decisions can haunt us for the rest of our lives this is why we cannot make decisions lightly we see that Abraham just for an example Abraham chose to listen to Sarah and he went into Hagar total outside of God's Will It produced an Ishmael he got ahead of God's program went outside God's will right his actions now his his actions did not change God's mind God said that him and Sarah was going to have a son and God meant it that wouldn't change but through Abraham's choices of getting out of God's will he produced an Ishmael right now that didn't change the Covenant with Abraham God made an unconditional Covenant but Ishmael never went away either Ishmael until this day has remained a thorn in Israel's side and you say man and he actually become a great nation but it was outside the will of God David a man after God's Own Heart anointed to be king over Israel but he made a bad choice he looked at a man's wife had him killed married her right the Bible tells us he paid dearly for what he did every time in the Bible when a a man of God or a person makes a bad choice they pay dearly God's going to bring that correction and you say man but he makes it all work out for his own good so what what I'm trying to tell you and and is is you you young people you know see our choices are rewarded both good and bad can you say man and and a lot of our choices does not touch us about doesn't touch us whether we're hinge on whether we're going to heaven or not our choices will hinge on what happens here I've seen men make the bad choices that takes them out of pulpits and the gift Still Remains in them but they they've wasted their Ministry by the bad choice they made come on yeah men that are called to be deacons men that you know and even even women called to be Preachers Wives or to help and all these things they get they get so messed up does it change their destination I don't think so but what it does it makes it it makes misery they can't fulfill exactly what God's called them to do the same man you say I love God I know there's people that love God there's men that are preachers that have made their mistakes can't even stand now can't even get behind the pulpit according to the word of God and they love God they've repented but they sold it they made the choice and all this life whether they live to be 80 to 100. that gift is within them and they'll just they'll just long to be back in a Pulpit that they can't be in I hope you understand you young people you have not messed up your lives in any way sure you've made minor mistakes sure you're this and and you're going to make plenty of them every one of us does it this preacher does it and we all regret it and we all pay for it there's not a one of us here that have that have have looked back in our life without regret and say man I wish I would have done something different right but I want to tell you as long as God tarries there's going to be preachers we're going to need preachers stand and take this place you with me we're going to need this Young Generation to rise up to what God has called him to be and be fervent but don't you let Satan mess your life up by wrong choices don't cruise through life living life just for fun I said well I'm predestinated glory to God you know it'll all work out the thing is you've got to make the choices life and death is before you you ministers just as much you God's called you to preach the gospel okay so we're going to be preachers then you hang around the video game you hang around the comedy you listen to this you're listening to that listen that never spend time with God never spend time for nothing I'll say it in in this way too we'll live our lives any old way don't care what people think to where and I'm not saying it's here I'm just saying to where people look at our lives and don't respect us don't trust us then we oh we're preachers we're gonna get up here we're going to preach Who you gonna preach to people that don't like you people don't trust you people don't respect you you do no good you see what I'm saying we make choices and these choices affect we got to be in the will of God if God called us to be ministers then we're going to have to we're going to have to live that life God help us to live the life if God has called us to be Christians let's live a life so that somebody can see Christ in US choices that we make and every one of us are are are called to it you agree so I know you young people you go through battles and you're going through them you realize you're a target for the enemy because the devil would love to have you because you're a life that ain't wrecked yet and you're at a place that Mom and Dad can't help you you're getting to an age where Mom and Dad can't can't help they can give you advice but you're gonna have to make your
