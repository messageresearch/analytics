[0:40] time and he went in by himself but when
[0:43] he returned back to Glory he said lift
[0:46] up all ye Kates of everlasting life and
[0:49] he took the strengths of God out of the
[0:51] grave and took them into the
[0:54] heavens
[0:56] Hallelujah there is a blood tonight on
[0:59] the sacrif
[1:00] of almighty God there's an altar tonight
[1:03] with a blood on it that says Perfection
[1:08] belongs it belongs to
[1:12] you by one
[1:15] sacrifice so don't try to put yours next
[1:18] to it

[1:24] works you got to take them
[1:26] all if you're going to take one you got
[1:28] to take them all
[1:31] so either it's your works or his works
[1:33] and I tell you what I did I dropped all
[1:36] mine cuz I tell you what I found out I'm
[1:38] dead from my birth my first work in this
[1:42] life I came into the Earth wrong and
[1:45] whatever else I do I'll never be
[1:48] right but by one
[1:52] Sacrifice by one
[1:54] sacrifice Jesus by one sacrifice I love
[1:57] it don't you he perfected forever
[2:00] and when we are perfect through Christ
[2:03] and we are free from judgment through
[2:06] Christ I know some of you's been
[2:08] dreading that judgment but listen if
[2:10] you've accepted Christ I'm going to give
[2:12] you the scripture now in John 5 and 24
[2:16] brother Bram said a handful and two
[2:17] dozen
[2:18] eggs two dozen eggs quite a handful John
[2:22] 5 pass from Death unto life and shall
[2:25] not somebody say shall not not come into
[2:28] condemnation that word condemnation is
[2:31] Judgment brother B said because they
[2:33] have already bypassed judgment because
[2:36] they B their judgment in him we are free
[2:39] from judgment through Christ we shall
[2:41] never die through Christ we have lost
[2:44] death and found life through Christ not
[2:47] through any
[2:49] church I better read that again because
[2:51] I think I've heard people say that if
[2:53] you don't come to our
[2:54] church let me read that again we have
[2:57] lost death and found life through Christ
[3:00] not through any
[3:04] church now I believe we ought to have
[3:06] churches and I'm a I'm a preacher and a
[3:09] pastor and I love church and I want to
[3:11] go to church but there's no church can
[3:13] save
[3:15] you come on there ain't just one Church
[3:18] there ain't that great mega church
[3:20] that's going to take everybody in the
[3:22] Rapture there is only one sacrifice and
[3:25] there's only one way it's the Precious
[3:28] Blood of our Lord Jesus
[3:30] Christ no church can take you in no
[3:33] preacher can pack you in amen there has
[3:36] been a sacrifice of mdict in this age
[3:40] well I believe it
[3:42] tonight you'll not get there through
[3:45] dominin so you can you can get a group
[3:47] of guys together and you can start
[3:49] agreeing on your Doctrine and you say
[3:50] well if you don't preach our Dole let me
[3:52] say this I'll never bow to a bunch of
[3:55] men getting their minds together and
[3:57] making up what truth is we are perfected
[4:00] through a sacrifice of the blood of
[4:03] Jesus Christ there's only one man this
[4:06] church bows to it is Jesus Christ the
[4:09] son of the Living
[4:13] God let me say this any man that wants
[4:16] other men to bow to him is
[4:18] sick it's a sick man and he needs to get
[4:21] the Holy
[4:22] [Applause]
[4:23] [Music]
[4:27] Ghost well go I think we're going to
[4:30] have church this
[4:32] [Applause]
[4:34] weekend do you see you'll never get it
[4:36] through any
[4:40] denomination there's something really
[4:42] wrong you know they told Brother Bram
[4:44] that time they h brother Scott you ain't
[4:47] never you ain't never had nobody tell
[4:48] you that I know we took this guy off our
[4:50] book said he can't go to
[4:53] heaven
[4:56] well isn't it amazing that you didn't
[4:59] call me and you didn't save me so you
[5:03] can't get rid of
[5:04] me isn't that
[5:08] amazing he fantastic now listen we were
[5:12] just listening to a tape on the way to
[5:13] church brother Isaac and I were
[5:14] listening coming down the road and we
[5:15] were listening to Perfection 1956 I
[5:18] think it is and brother B said if you
[5:19] were a jean seed and elected he said you
[5:21] might shout or you might not he said you
[5:24] might dance and you might not he said
[5:26] but really it don't make any difference
[5:27] either way you said pre what are you
[5:30] saying I'm saying that your your
[5:31] salvation has nothing to do with your
[5:33] shouting I say your salvation has
[5:35] nothing to do with your tongue speaking
[5:37] your salvation has nothing to do with
[5:39] your day salvation is based upon the
[5:42] fact of whether you receive the blood of
[5:45] Jesus Christ for your sins or not but
[5:48] how can a man ever receive the blood and
[5:51] not feel like shouting a little while
[5:53] not feel like dancing a little while I
[5:56] tell you what I'm so glad tonight that
[5:58] I've got a liberty I've got a liberty in
[6:01] Christ we are free by the
[6:04] blood
[6:07] hallelujah oh if I was a singer I'd sing
[6:10] it free free free from the things of
[6:13] this old
[6:14] world
[6:16] my how do we get in Perfection that's
[6:19] what we want to know how we get
[6:21] there well if you ever figure out how
[6:23] you got there amen you'll know it's a
[6:26] security right the prophet of God said
[6:29] he laid upon him the iniquity of his all
[6:31] he was wounded for our train Isaiah 53
[6:33] bruised for our iniquity the trasp of
[6:35] our peace was on him Stripes were healed
[6:37] that's the body we want to get into
[6:40] that's the
[6:41] body if you're in that body in that body
[6:46] you'll never see
[6:47] judgment now that's powerful friends I
[6:51] can promise you a way to bypass judgment
[6:54] I can promise you a night tonight I can
[6:56] make a promise to you that you'll never
[6:59] have to to see a judgment bar I can
[7:01] promise to you that you'll never stand
[7:04] before the white Throne of almighty God
[7:06] if you'll get into this body you will
[7:09] never stand in
[7:12] judgment oh my goodness what a place to
[7:14] be you'll never see judgment you'll
[7:17] never taste death you're free from Death
[7:19] judgment sin and everything else when
[7:21] you're in that
[7:23] body how do you get into it preacher by
[7:26] joining this Tabernacle you're lost amen
[7:29] we don't have any book how do we get
[7:32] into it by joining some church no sir
[7:35] how do we get into it you're born into
[7:37] it come on you never joined your family
[7:40] you were born into your family you're
[7:42] never going to join a church that can
[7:44] give you salvation you got to be born
[7:47] into the church that gives you salvation
[7:50] and the Bible tells us this in 1
[7:51] Corinthians 12 that by one Spirit we are
[7:54] all baptized into one body that's why
[7:57] the new birth is the bapt AP ISM of the
[8:00] Holy Ghost now when you get the baptism
[8:03] of the Holy Ghost you the same life that
[8:05] was in God has come into you how could
[8:09] you die how could you be lost How Could
[8:11] You sin how could you be unperfect the
[8:14] life that is in you is in the life that
[8:16] was in almighty God it's God God
[8:19] requires Perfection no one says None is
[8:22] perfect so if you must be perfect to get
[8:24] to heaven the scripture says None is
[8:26] perfect we've all s come sin and come
[8:28] short of the glory of God how are we
[8:29] ever going to enter God's living place
[8:31] and Dwelling Place when he requires
[8:33] Perfection Jesus said in the sermon he
[8:36] said be you therefore perfect as my
[8:37] father's in heaven is perfect think of
[8:39] the Perfection that God requires of a
[8:41] person a Perfection Amen in law having a
[8:45] shadow 1956 be you therefore perfect as
[8:48] your father how are you going to do it
[8:51] you going to do it how can you be
[8:53] perfect as god is perfect but that is
[8:56] the commission the Commandment of Jesus
[8:58] is be perfect because God is in heaven
[9:00] then who could be saved see if you could
[9:03] just a moment let's found out how that
[9:05] Perfection is made see God back there in
[9:08] the beginning for saw down through the
[9:11] streak of time and he knew he would have
[9:13] to have a remedy to save those that were
[9:15] Desiring to be saved how many here
[9:18] tonight desire to be
[9:20] saved if you desire to be saved then God
[9:23] made a way for you to be saved isn't
[9:27] that amazing that your desire is what
[9:29] saves
[9:30] you and God himself gave you the
[9:34] desire matter of fact somebody said well
[9:36] brother Wayne self gave you the
[9:39] desire matter of fact somebody said well
[9:41] brother Wayne I blasphemed the Holy
[9:43] Ghost and I went beyond the Blood
[9:44] Brother BR said do you want to serve God
[9:47] and do you love Jesus and the man said
[9:49] yes I love him he said that tells me and
[9:51] he said there was a little hickey in
[9:53] time and we fell into time out of
[9:55] Eternity he said but that's where
[9:58] Redemption is made
[10:00] in that little place that come out of
[10:02] Eternity that's where redemption's
[10:06] made amen that's where your enemy is
[10:10] destroyed that's where the blood comes
[10:12] upon listen now some people say well
[10:14] brother Wayne I tell you why I'm dealing
[10:16] with this devil and I and I I'm afraid
[10:18] I'm not going to make it back do you
[10:19] recognize brother T you would have had
[10:21] to live all of eternity with that devil
[10:24] that haunt you you would have had to
[10:25] live eternally with that thing but God
[10:28] made a little place called time harm you
[10:31] and he's going to destroy him so he
[10:33] can't make it through eternity with you
[10:36] listen let me tell you there is no end
[10:38] to a Son of God but there is an end to
[10:40] the devil the devil will be annihilated
[10:43] and thrown into the Lake of Fire but the
[10:45] Bride of Jesus Christ there will be no
[10:48] end to her life it is eternal in
[10:55] heaven oh I thank God tonight that God
[10:58] made a place it's called time a place
[11:02] where we could bring our enemy and he
[11:03] would be
[11:04] destroyed I tell you when you bring your
[11:07] enemy to the blood the Perfection comes
[11:10] between us and God the blood of Christ
[11:13] is what perfects Us in the Holy
[11:17] Spirit now in 1954 brother bam says J
[11:20] sin's judgment is to take life how
[11:23] people know they can look and see that's
[11:26] how we believe so supremely in the Lord
[11:28] Jesus
[11:29] Jesus I used to think was a Jew and he
[11:32] had Jewish blood and he was born of a
[11:33] Jewish mother but he wasn't of Jewish
[11:36] blood and neither was he Gentile blood
[11:39] he was the blood of
[11:42] God oh he was the blood of God that's
[11:44] why in the church book brother R said
[11:46] it's a perfect loosing if it was the
[11:49] blood of God it is a perfect blood then
[11:51] it's a perfect loosing if it's a perfect
[11:54] blood it's a perfect sacrifice then it
[11:56] has the power to free you completely ly
[12:00] of whatever it is that holds you listen
[12:02] whatever was done in time the blood that
[12:06] came from eternity has been designed to
[12:10] destroy s can I say this many people
[12:12] today are worried about the tribulation
[12:15] period and it's coming but you know what
[12:17] tonight if you're the bride of Christ
[12:18] let me tell you this I ought to truly
[12:21] settle in every heart of every bit of
[12:23] the church that the bride doesn't take
[12:26] tribulation the bride's gone she has not
[12:30] one
[12:32] sin not a thing against her somebody
[12:35] tell me why tell me why what's the
[12:37] three-fold purpose of the six seal the
[12:39] tribulation period remember it's to
[12:40] purge the foolish virgin it's to purge
[12:43] the Earth and it's to purge 144,000 God
[12:46] don't do anything without a purpose and
[12:49] if there is no sin in the bride why
[12:51] would you go through the purpose not
[12:53] even a remembrance of
[12:57] it now you you might remember it but God
[13:01] [Applause]
[13:02] don't and wouldn't it be something if
[13:05] you could get where God
[13:07] is if you could wash your mind in the
[13:09] same blood he's washed your soul
[13:12] in amen that there's one thing but in
[13:14] the presence of God you I just going to
[13:16] say this brother BR types the blood as a
[13:19] bleach y'all all know what the bleach is
[13:21] of course but he types the blood as a
[13:23] bleach and the power of bleach amen if
[13:26] you got any colors on your on on it you
[13:28] can tell everywhere it touch
[13:30] because bleach is powerful and and you
[13:32] know maybe Clorox bleach or maybe tide
[13:35] bleach or maybe generic bleach but
[13:37] whatever bleach is powerful but the
[13:40] bleach I'm talking about didn't come
[13:42] amen
[13:43] from the bleach I'm talking about amen
[13:46] they didn't make it down there at tide
[13:48] they didn't make it over at the Clorox
[13:50] plant but this bleach is a bleach from
[13:52] Heaven that they made this bleach in
[13:55] heaven God spoke a word over Mary and
[13:59] God himself got into a blood cell to
[14:02] produce a bleach that could destroy sin
[14:06] what the blood of bulls and goats could
[14:08] not do the blood of Jesus Christ by one
[14:12] by one
[14:13] touch again amen I hope you're doing
[14:16] okay amen do you see what it is amen
[14:18] that God has purged her and placed her
[14:21] in a place she doesn't have to go
[14:23] through the tribulation he's not
[14:25] trusting in works it's in the blood of
[14:27] Jesus that is confess is dropped into do
[14:30] you see what it is God is a spirit and
[14:33] he overshadowed Mary and created in her
[14:35] a blood cell that brought blood is
[14:39] dismissed woo your sexual blood is
[14:42] dismissed you know how powerful that
[14:45] is because you know some of the things
[14:47] you carry you're carrying from former
[14:49] Generations do you know you're carrying
[14:51] part of the Troubles of your fathers in
[14:53] you do you know this that Abraham that
[14:55] that Levi was in the loins of Abraham
[14:57] four generations and it was Rec
[14:59] recognized to being in now now think
[15:01] about this as you were germinated in the
[15:03] loins of your father even four
[15:05] generations ago then there is sins that
[15:08] hung around your family
[15:10] line now I know nobody likes to talk
[15:12] about this but that's the reason some of
[15:13] you boys have so much trouble with the
[15:15] passion it's because that sin hung
[15:17] around that family line that's why
[15:19] sometimes that nervousness and
[15:21] depressions go along a certain Spirit
[15:23] along a certain family line or there's a
[15:25] high temper that goes along or an
[15:27] unforgiveness or a Jud amen it goes
[15:30] along family lines but let me say
[15:32] something to you tonight amen there's a
[15:34] sacrifice here that can bypass your
[15:37] family lines it can bypass your heritage
[15:40] it can dismiss your sexual birth and
[15:43] give you a new birth in a new blood by
[15:46] the baptism of the Holy Ghost and birth
[15:49] deity on inside of
[15:52] you it's a family line do you see what
[15:55] it is our sexual blood is dismissed and
[15:58] Jes Jesus Christ stands for our
[16:00] atonement making atonement for our sins
[16:03] it's a beautiful picture can I can I
[16:06] just challenge you to say this there is
[16:08] no Perfection outside the
[16:10] blood and there will be no more shedding
[16:13] of the blood so by faith when you hear
[16:16] the word and receive the word it washes
[16:18] the soul and the sanctifying power of
[16:21] the baptism of the Holy Ghost gives you
[16:23] a new life that stands in the presence
[16:25] of God now watch this because now I
[16:28] think I think it's amazing because Paul
[16:31] now says that there is a five-fold
[16:33] Ministry isn't it odd that he's took out
[16:35] the levitical order and for the first
[16:37] time he's talking about preaching and
[16:40] he's talking about offices that God uses
[16:42] to preach do y'all recognize that God
[16:45] preached the word of God to the Saints
[16:47] in the last days do you know that the
[16:49] Bible teaches us that that five-fold is
[16:51] an office of almighty God and brother
[16:53] random said it's actually God's dress
[16:57] wear in other words God gets dressed up
[17:00] in a
[17:01] man and speaks to a congregation as they
[17:04] pull on the gift amen and the spirit of
[17:07] the Lord uses human voices and he uses
[17:10] human being now I know it would be
[17:11] advantageous if he would use Angels amen
[17:14] because Angels ain't got no
[17:16] problems and Angels don't have no issues
[17:19] and and Angels never you never had any
[17:21] spar with them you never had any issues
[17:23] with them amen I know what it is amen
[17:25] but your pastor he's a
[17:27] man and your angelist he's a man and
[17:30] you're they're just men church amen but
[17:33] listen if God Amen wanted to use trees
[17:37] he had them if he wanted to use angels
[17:40] He had them if he wanted to use the
[17:42] Stars he had them but God chose mortal
[17:46] men which Tri knows what it is to get
[17:49] into the blood let me say this God can
[17:52] take a drunk and make a preacher out of
[17:53] him amen and he can tell you that if
[17:56] there's anything that'll get alcohol out
[17:58] of your life it's the power of the blood
[18:01] of Jesus Christ he could take a
[18:03] cigarette smoker or a dope addict and
[18:06] save him and sanctify and put a mic in
[18:08] his hand Amen brother Marky knows how to
[18:11] do
[18:13] it I know people would rather have
[18:15] perfect things preaching to them but God
[18:17] didn't choose perfect
[18:19] things not perfect by man's
[18:23] ideas but perfect through his blood
[18:26] because they were going to be the
[18:27] ministry of the new
[18:31] they were going to preach this New
[18:32] Covenant they're going to take the word
[18:35] and operate under that anointing and
[18:38] preach a Perfection of the people you
[18:40] know it's amazing to me I don't know
[18:42] about you all I don't have a lot of time
[18:44] to spend there but I just I just think
[18:46] it's amazing the way brother Bram talks
[18:48] about the five-fold ministry and he said
[18:50] actually he said an angel in the pull
[18:53] pit had more Authority than an angel in
[18:55] heaven
[18:59] and he said you'll no never be any
[19:00] closer to
[19:02] God can you imagine how much that God
[19:06] has placed on these men now here's the
[19:09] beauty of this is then he told this
[19:12] five-fold ministry to perfect the
[19:15] Saints well you know I was reading that
[19:17] the other day and I I I had to reread
[19:19] that three times for the
[19:22] perfecting of the
[19:24] Saints now wait a minute are you talking
[19:27] about the ones that's in Ephesians 1
[19:30] that Paul Begins by saying and unto the
[19:32] Saints which are at Ephesus to the
[19:36] Saints brother man picks up that word
[19:37] and he said now I know people believe
[19:39] that you got to be a saint after you die
[19:41] he said but Paul was talking to living
[19:43] people he said a saint means someone
[19:46] Sanctified in the blood that has
[19:48] received the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[19:50] he said that's why the book of Ephesians
[19:52] is not an Evangelical book he said it's
[19:54] a book to Believers and just as Joshua
[19:58] placed the Israel into their Promised
[20:01] Land the book of Ephesians was designed
[20:03] as a new testament Joshua book to put
[20:06] believers who have already received the
[20:08] Holy Ghost and put them in you that
[20:10] Perfection come completely through the
[20:12] blood how am I going to perfect a
[20:14] perfect
[20:16] person it says that doesn't it therefore
[20:19] perfecting the Saints you say preacher
[20:21] amen you got me well it had me too but
[20:24] if you get into the Greek of this
[20:25] there's one time this Greek word is used
[20:28] and this scripture is the only time in
[20:30] the Bible this Greek word is used and
[20:32] it's actually k a t a r t i s o Ms uh C
[20:36] Catos amen but actually what it means is
[20:40] a Furnishing or an
[20:42] equipping it doesn't mean perfecting
[20:45] like the blood perfected you this means
[20:47] that the sons of God was going to take
[20:50] the word of God and equip the Church of
[20:53] the Living God how do you equip this
[20:55] bride you equip her with a word you
[20:57] equip her with love you equip her with
[21:00] knowledge you equip her amen and put the
[21:02] word of God into her hands the Saints of
[21:05] the Living God has got a fourfold
[21:08] Ministry that will take the message of
[21:11] the hour and equip them to whip the
[21:14] devil any place anywhere anytime under
[21:17] any
[21:18] circumstances we're not talking about
[21:20] perfecting the Saints in that we're
[21:22] going to make you a perfect person come
[21:24] on perect but we're perfecting them in
[21:27] the fact we are equipping
[21:29] them now it's it's what the it's only
[21:32] Greek word only time it's used in the
[21:33] Bible because he's talking about
[21:35] perfecting in equipping it's talking
[21:38] about giving you the word you're in a
[21:40] great battle you're in a great conflict
[21:43] and what better way to perfect or equip
[21:46] a man than to give him the word of
[21:49] God a five-fold Ministry for the
[21:52] perfecting of the Saints now watch this
[21:55] because the next verses tells you
[21:57] something beautiful it's for the work of
[21:59] the ministry for the edifying of the
[22:01] body until we come into the unity of
[22:03] faith and the knowledge of the Son of
[22:05] God unto a perfect man now there's that
[22:07] same Greek word again perfect it's the
[22:09] same Greek word unto a perfect man amen
[22:13] but when it's in an English word perfect
[22:15] man but when you go to the it changes
[22:18] words and it uses the word teos which
[22:22] the Greek word teos means a man of full
[22:27] age now other words watch Perfection is
[22:30] a full grown man what he's talking about
[22:35] is that these people will be receiving
[22:38] an that's why you set service after
[22:40] service hear the word of God it's
[22:42] because you're growing in the grace of
[22:45] God unto a perfect man unto an adulthood
[22:49] now watch Paul's going to say something
[22:51] here I hope this is all right it's all
[22:52] right with everybody amen amen now watch
[22:55] this because what he's going to do Under
[22:57] the measure of the stature of the
[22:59] fullness of Christ you all know the
[23:00] stature of the perfect man he's saying
[23:02] that the church is going to grow into
[23:04] this stature of the fullness of Christ
[23:07] that we henceforth be no more children
[23:11] tossed to and for and carried by every
[23:14] wind of Doctrine Now isn't this amazing
[23:17] Paul is saying that the five-fold was
[23:19] going to equip the church and bring them
[23:21] to an adulthood where they wouldn't be
[23:24] tossed around by everything everybody
[23:27] says now you ever seen a kid and you can
[23:29] talk to a kid and you can start telling
[23:31] it one thing amen and it'll start
[23:33] leaning toward whoever is talking to and
[23:35] you can see immaturity in Christians
[23:37] when they go to one meeting they lean a
[23:39] little this way go to one meeting they
[23:41] lean there starts becoming a maturity in
[23:45] your life amen where you're able to stay
[23:48] stable on the word no matter what people
[23:50] are saying what this Gody says this way
[23:53] what that guy says this way amen there's
[23:56] something in your heart that begin to
[23:58] Anchor and stabilize you to the perfect
[24:01] word of God as an adult Christian no
[24:04] longer children tossed to and fro now
[24:08] now it's beautiful because this word
[24:09] children here is actually amen it's the
[24:13] word NEOS n e p i o s it's Greek now but
[24:16] that word nepos actually means a child
[24:19] an infant a minor a childish untaught or
[24:24] unskilled so you can receive the baptism
[24:27] of the Holy Ghost and remain untaught or
[24:29] unskilled you can be perfect under the
[24:32] blood of Jesus Christ and remain
[24:34] untaught and unskilled you can R remain
[24:37] immature as a Christian and be
[24:39] completely a Christian you can be a Son
[24:42] of God completely a Son of God and be
[24:45] immature in your actions in your church
[24:48] goinging you can be immature in your
[24:50] offerings you can be immature in your
[24:52] tithing you can be immature in your
[24:56] relationships the word of God and teach
[24:59] the Church of the Living God what it
[25:01] means to walk right what it means to
[25:03] talk right what it means to
[25:08] love yes sir amen what it does is the
[25:11] bride church is being moved from a baby
[25:14] or a child to a full mature son in
[25:18] Hebrews 5 and 12 I'll read it to you out
[25:20] of the Bible when a time you ought to be
[25:22] teachers you have need one teaching you
[25:24] again the first principles are the
[25:26] oracles and become as one one having
[25:28] need of milk and not of strong meat for
[25:31] everyone that useth milk is unskillful
[25:34] in the word of righteousness for he is a
[25:39] babe now he's perfectly perfect in God
[25:43] but he's not perfect in his to them that
[25:46] are of a full age that word full age is
[25:49] teos it's the same word as perfect in
[25:51] the book of Ephesians but now it's being
[25:54] used as full age but to those that are
[25:57] perfect even as those having by reason
[26:00] of use their senses exercised to discern
[26:04] both good and evil listen discernment
[26:07] comes from understanding of the word of
[26:09] God you begin to look at things and know
[26:12] what it's coming from where it's going
[26:14] how it's going amen every believer in
[26:16] here tonight ought to have discernment
[26:19] but as you grow in the word your
[26:21] discernment become
[26:24] sharper and you begin to understand full
[26:27] age now watch this in galatian chapter 4
[26:30] He Man Paul says the same writer now he
[26:32] says that they Heir as long as he is a
[26:36] child untaught he differ nothing from a
[26:40] servant being he's Lord of all now what
[26:43] Paul is saying is a father on a farm has
[26:46] a child and he's running around on the
[26:48] farm and he ain't no different than the
[26:51] servants he don't have a checkbook in
[26:53] his hand he's not hiring and firing he's
[26:57] just out there playing in the yard
[26:59] because he is an untaught child now
[27:02] there is a difference between the child
[27:04] and the servant but it's not until the
[27:07] message I mean the teaching comes that
[27:09] you begin to discern the difference
[27:12] between the Son and the servant the
[27:14] Jubilee Trumpet of the Seven Seals will
[27:18] tell you if it's a son or a servant if
[27:21] it's a Son of God they will turn and
[27:24] begin to bring the teaching brother
[27:26] random says it clearly the law of
[27:27] adoption in the church it's not that you
[27:29] went and got somebody's son and made him
[27:31] your son he says it's that you had a son
[27:34] and you're busy in your farm so you hire
[27:37] yourself a tutor and he begins to raise
[27:39] the child according to the way the
[27:42] father's teachings are and that tutor
[27:45] tutors the child and the way and when
[27:47] the child knows the father's business he
[27:49] gives him a checkbook and he tells him
[27:51] you can hire you can fire you can plant
[27:53] you can reap you can Harvest and he
[27:55] gives a full authority to that child
[27:58] because he's a taught child he's no
[28:00] longer a babe he is now an adult he is
[28:04] now no longer just another man he's not
[28:07] just another servant he is an authority
[28:09] now let me say something to you tonight
[28:11] now I know that if your daddy was a
[28:13] farmer you'd be learning farming and if
[28:15] your daddy was a banker you'd be
[28:16] learning banking amen but we are not in
[28:19] our father's business is not banking our
[28:22] father's business is not farming our
[28:25] father's business amen isn't it what
[28:27] Jesus said I was busy about my father's
[28:30] business brother randam said he was busy
[28:33] about his father's business his father's
[28:35] business was vindicating the word of God
[28:40] Amen do you see that when Malachi 4 is
[28:43] Vindicated and Revelations 10 is
[28:45] Vindicated it's the father's business
[28:48] and here tonight you are a part of the
[28:51] Vindication of this
[28:53] message this message has been training
[28:56] and teaching and generation of people
[28:59] come on now amen that by this of God
[29:03] come on we are not back there
[29:05] Pentecostal babies come on we're not
[29:08] we're not back there trying to put a a
[29:10] shoelace through a baby shoe and figure
[29:12] out how it works we have moved from the
[29:14] first into the second and now we have
[29:17] reached the third pool and the third
[29:19] pool was the opening of the word of God
[29:24] a now when we were children we were
[29:27] under bondage
[29:29] somebody said brother Wayne when I got
[29:30] new birth you know I got my checkbook
[29:32] that's not what the prophet
[29:36] taught well it's not I got 1,00 books I
[29:39] can show you where brother Bram said
[29:40] your new birth is not your
[29:43] adoption but I can't show you where one
[29:46] time he said a new birth was
[29:49] adoption because he didn't say
[29:52] it you said brother Wayne I thought I
[29:55] believe well see what it is it's
[29:57] children tossed to and
[29:59] fro from one man's teaching to another
[30:01] man's teaching William brandom taught
[30:03] four parts on adoption and he taught
[30:06] hear you him many many many times and
[30:10] when we can dismiss all of his teaching
[30:12] to take another man's teaching we have
[30:14] reached a stage of immaturity rather
[30:17] than maturity there ought to be a
[30:19] maturity in this bride that'll say I'll
[30:21] say what the prophet said you can hit me
[30:24] cut me beat me throw me out I'll stay
[30:27] with this message
[30:28] I will not Bend I Will Not Bow I will
[30:31] not amen
[30:35] confirm well glory to God it's time to
[30:38] grow up and say what a prophet
[30:46] said somebody said well Wayne what
[30:49] what's it like then brother B said when
[30:50] you get a new birth and the holy ghost
[30:52] coming you in way he said it was he said
[30:53] it was like a button off of your shirt
[30:55] coming into your soul he said and the
[30:57] more it it begins to take over your body
[31:00] and it takes over your hand and it takes
[31:02] over your mouth and it takes over just
[31:04] the way the children of Israel took over
[31:05] that Promised Land the Holy Ghost takes
[31:08] over you and you say well brother Wayne
[31:10] then how far have we come I tell you how
[31:12] far the bride has come she has come to
[31:14] mount
[31:15] Transfiguration she has come to an
[31:17] experience with God that she only hears
[31:21] the word of God isn't it what he heard
[31:24] him say out of that cloud hear ye him if
[31:29] he said hear ye him he's going to speak
[31:31] and he's speaking in the last
[31:34] [Applause]
[31:35] days in Hebrews chap 12 and 22 that's
[31:39] why Paul said you have come to Mount
[31:42] Zion goodness
[31:45] gracious you have come to how far have
[31:48] we come brother Wayne I'll tell you this
[31:49] we've not come to Mount
[31:52] Si we've not just come to Mount
[31:55] Calvary we have come to mount Zion you
[31:59] say what is Mount Zion Mount Zion is the
[32:01] bride it's to the general assembly the
[32:03] Church of the firstborn that were
[32:05] written in heaven and God the judge of
[32:07] all the spirits of just men made perfect
[32:11] the spirits of just men men that are
[32:13] Justified men that are already in the
[32:16] presence of God but there is a
[32:18] perfecting of a believer that moves you
[32:21] from a baby to a man come on chur handle
[32:26] it come on
[32:28] you pick the phone up and you call this
[32:30] guy about this guy and you run and

[32:35] Bible said that you ought to pick up the
[32:37] phone and call your
[32:39] brother come on church if it's a truth
[32:42] it's the truth if you got an offense
[32:44] with somebody quit telling to them or
[32:46] rebuke
[32:49] them I believe in the oldfashioned Holy
[32:52] Ghost the kind that burns out sin and
[32:54] kills the devil
[32:58] yes
[32:59] sir I I I believe
[33:02] it I certainly believe that there'd be
[33:04] less sickness in the
[33:07] bodies if people would ask forgiveness
[33:09] of one another instead of holding
[33:10] grudges for
[33:11] [Applause]
[33:14] years I believe it like a bunch of kids
[33:17] playing in a toy box outside and one's
[33:19] mad at the other cuz they got their toy
[33:21] and they go tatt on mama let let me the
[33:23] best thing in the world you ever did was
[33:25] love somebody enough to tell them your
[33:28] heart sit down with them and discuss the
[33:33] thing and we need to get this thing
[33:36] right come on friends sometimes we
[33:39] wonder why is there not a revival going
[33:41] on in our church I tell you why cuz
[33:44] we've turned into a bunch of immature
[33:46] people people used to say they're sorry
[33:49] when they were wrong they used to repent
[33:51] when they were wrong come on
[33:55] Church well we might as well preach as a
[33:57] first night ain't it let me say this the
[34:00] water's still there

[34:04] dry place in your life and you're saying
[34:06] other Wayne where's the spirit where's
[34:08] the anointing it's still here it's still
[34:11] right in the same place but all you got
[34:13] to do is start digging and if you'll
[34:15] start digging amen there's water below
[34:18] your feet if you dig past the hurt
[34:20] feeling if you dig past the trouble if
[34:23] you dig past the rumors if you dig past
[34:26] the complex there he is a Holy Ghost of
[34:29] God hallelujah there's a fountain filled
[34:33] with blood flowing through this room
[34:37] tonight so brother Wayne you called us
[34:39] immature I don't really mean that I just
[34:40] mean it's immature
[34:44] ways and now I know all y'all's adults
[34:47] have you ever acted like a
[34:49] kid I remember I got a nice pickup and I
[34:51] was about 22 three just give my heart to
[34:54] the Lord had a real nice Dodge man that
[34:56] thing was a hot ride
[34:59] and I was a Christian and all the cops
[35:01] in town they knew me as the good
[35:05] Lawson they pulled my wife over and they
[35:07] said which one you married
[35:09] to she'd say Wayne oh you're married to
[35:12] the good
[35:13] one and one night I got out there and a
[35:15] bunch of kids standing there I was 22 23
[35:17] year old pulled out man I got in that
[35:19] Dodge
[35:20] and slid the side of that backup truck
[35:23] around fish tailed it a little bit
[35:25] and smoke was rolling
[35:29] then I looked up and here come the blues
[35:31] rolling he pulled up and pulled up
[35:34] walked right behind I knew him well knew
[35:36] his name he knew me he looked at me he
[35:38] said Wayne how old are
[35:41] you I said
[35:42] old I was old enough to know
[35:46] better you see there's a teaching of the
[35:49] church that brings the righteous to
[35:51] Perfection it's what is the full grown
[35:54] Christian when you think about perfect
[35:56] Christian I'm talking about a full grown
[36:00] Christian whether you like otions and it
[36:04] has
[36:04] reactions and Paul says that it's like
[36:07] it's like being chained up to a dead man
[36:10] a brother Donnie Reagan preached a
[36:11] famous sermon one time I've actually
[36:13] never heard it God bless forgive me
[36:14] brother Donnie but but I've heard the
[36:16] sermon title a lot and I know right
[36:18] where he got it in
[36:19] scripture but what it's talking about is
[36:21] there's an
[36:23] out that's right youen you might have a
[36:26] soul in there that is saved and
[36:28] Sanctified and filled with the Holy
[36:30] Ghost in one of these days it is
[36:32] Immortal with God but this old body if a
[36:34] Rapture don't comes going to go in the
[36:36] grave because it's a hybrid body but one
[36:39] of these mornings God's going to take
[36:41] the soul and overcome the outside man
[36:44] you're going to have to kill that thing
[36:46] come on Paul said we're going to have to
[36:48] Die
[36:49] daily let me tell you what brother Ram
[36:51] said he said the old man's dead you put
[36:53] him on the cross and you crucified him
[36:55] he said now stay dead
[36:58] that's a good quote ain't it you got to
[37:00] stay
[37:00] [Applause]
[37:02] dead I was up in Canada one time you
[37:05] keep that jet black hair he said I Die
[37:08] daily he said ain't that what the Bible
[37:11] said I don't think it meant that
[37:15] exactly but everything in scripture has
[37:18] reflected the coming of a Perfect Bride
[37:21] I I'm reading the prophet saying that's
[37:22] what Moses and David was reflecting was
[37:24] the coming of a perfect groom he said
[37:27] and that that's what Luther and Wesley
[37:28] and Pentecost was reflecting is the
[37:31] coming of a Perfect Bride can I say to
[37:33] you tonight the alpha has become the
[37:36] Omega the seed has returned to seed
[37:39] again as a corporate bride you have
[37:42] crossed the Jordan Rivers as a as a
[37:45] Church of the Living God we have reached
[37:48] the reals of the place of perfection of
[37:51] the church she is full
[37:54] grown when I say that tonight brother
[37:57] Ram said says of course these messages
[37:58] are kept up for an appointed time now an
[38:01] appointed time was in the adoption
[38:03] ceremony brother Ram teaches it that it
[38:05] was an appointed time that you took the
[38:07] child out and P placed Authority on him
[38:09] these brother said that's when the
[38:10] Angels Came and they publicly made a
[38:12] show over him and they and they and they
[38:14] they showed the authority and the father
[38:16] took him out to a public place and said
[38:17] this is my son and he appointed a time
[38:20] now if you're a studier of the message
[38:22] you'll know right before the Seven Seals
[38:24] opened up which was the Redemption
[38:27] rights of the church which was the
[38:29] inheritance of the church if you
[38:30] remember for the book of Jeremiah you
[38:32] remember when the trey of his uncle's
[38:35] son because under the Jubilee He would
[38:37] have a right was on the inside would be
[38:39] the rights to the property that was in
[38:42] Israel and God took our Redemptive
[38:45] rights and said in the days of the
[38:47] seventh angel messenger when he begins
[38:50] to sound that the rights of the church
[38:53] would come into view again that would be
[38:56] an inheritance Rel leased in the church
[38:59] now just before brother Brandon began
[39:01] the Seven Seals to preach the Redemptive
[39:02] rights of the church he preaches the
[39:04] breach between the church ages and the
[39:06] seals and he's teaching a change of the
[39:09] dispensation he's moving from what this
[39:11] says about it and who this says about it
[39:13] and what that says about it but it's the
[39:15] father taking his own word and now
[39:18] telling and instructing the church in
[39:21] his word now brother bam says this
[39:23] couldn't happen till an appointed time
[39:26] you ever seen the correlation the
[39:28] appointed time of the adoption and the
[39:30] appointed as a student you know them
[39:31] seals have been sealed from the
[39:33] foundation of the world those seals had
[39:35] been sealed up from the time that Adam
[39:38] lost his inheritance he took the Lamb's
[39:40] Book of Life somebody said well brother
[39:42] Wayne wouldn't they open and seal back
[39:43] no brother random actually says Daniel
[39:46] saw it in Daniel 12 but the angel said
[39:49] seal it up until the time of the end so
[39:51] that book had been sealed from the
[39:53] foundation of the world and it held the
[39:56] rights of Adam and could never be
[39:58] released Until the End Time matter of
[40:01] fact that's why in Revelations 5 that
[40:03] John was weeping though he had seen the
[40:06] sacrifice though he had seen the
[40:08] crucifixion though he had seen the seven
[40:10] Church ages and he was still crying
[40:13] because no man had been found worthy to
[40:16] take that book of redemption and open it
[40:19] for the Church of the Living God but
[40:22] according to Revelations 10 that was
[40:23] going to happen in the days of the voice
[40:25] of the seventh angel at the appointed
[40:28] time of the seventh angel there would
[40:30] come a Perfection on the
[40:32] church in 1 Corinthians 13 that's why it
[40:36] says when that which is perfect has come
[40:39] that which is in part will be done away
[40:42] what are we talking about in the parts
[40:44] throughout the ages nobody could fully
[40:47] tell you who you were but when that
[40:50] which is perfect is come you shall be
[40:52] known as you have been known who knew
[40:56] you where were you before the foundation
[40:59] of the world your original identity was
[41:02] in God but it was sealed up until the
[41:05] time of the end and God would release
[41:08] the names of the Bride of Jesus Christ
[41:13] the Queen of Heaven the queen who would
[41:15] have the inheritance the very title deed
[41:17] of the heavens and the
[41:21] earth when that is perfect has come
[41:24] watch what he says in the 11th verse I
[41:26] was a child spake as a child understood
[41:28] as a child thought as a child but when I
[41:31] become a man of your identity and your
[41:35] adulthood in who God made you cuz can I
[41:38] tell you a secret God didn't make you a
[41:41] child he never saw you as a
[41:45] child he never saw you as a
[41:47] sinner he saw you as a
[41:50] son and here comes the instruction
[41:53] manual underneath a message that would
[41:56] develop the church amen and bring it
[41:58] back to a masterpiece and a perfect
[42:01] place with God that's why brother bandom
[42:02] said it's a perfect place calling you to
[42:05] Perfection and how are you going to get
[42:08] there except the perfect
[42:11] word that's why he said it Hebrews 11
[42:14] they without
[42:16] us cannot be made
[42:19] perfect amen now watch what we're
[42:21] talking about Divine love coming on the
[42:23] cap right now if you want to if you want
[42:25] to carry on with that go to First John

[42:37] that now again what kind of love Agape
[42:40] Love Of course Divine love divine love
[42:43] called you a son be him as he is that's
[42:47] why he says in 2 Corinthians chapter 3
[42:49] that behold an adult we're looking at
[42:52] the unobscured word of God and as we
[42:55] behold the word we are changed
[42:59] changed oh changed changed from Glory un
[43:05] Glory that's why if you if you like to
[43:07] read the Bible That's why Paul continues
[43:09] in the book of Ephesians 4 here and said
[43:11] now what you ought to do is put off The
[43:13] Old Man and the conversation of the old
[43:15] man and put on the new man and be
[43:18] renewed in the spirit of your mind now
[43:20] what he's talking about is adulthood new
[43:22] man now a new man is not your New
[43:25] Birth come on you've already been born
[43:28] again how are you going to put on a new
[43:30] man it's the power of
[43:33] transformation amen if you like to read
[43:35] Ephesians chapter 4 putting on the new
[43:36] man just go to Romans chap 12 and verse
[43:38] 2 and of your mind so the Church of the
[43:41] Living God is to be
[43:42] transformed now what does that look like
[43:45] what does a transformation of a
[43:46] Christian looks like come on now we're
[43:49] not talking about a new birth you're
[43:50] talking about a transformation power of
[43:52] transformation brother B Begins by
[43:54] saying now that we've been born again
[43:56] now that we've been filled with the Holy
[43:57] Ghost what must we do he said we must be
[44:00] transformed into the image of the Living
[44:02] God a transformation of the in has life
[44:05] it has begun but it's on a journey to
[44:09] adulthood come on friends you watch that
[44:11] little fellon he's swimming along looks
[44:13] like all the other fish but give him a
[44:14] little time he just keeps eating L and
[44:17] as he eats he begins to grow arms and
[44:19] then he begins to grow amen lungs were
[44:22] he would he see he just had gills and
[44:24] all of the sudden he starts growing
[44:26] lungs he starts growing feet you know
[44:28] why because he's being developed for
[44:30] another world all he knows about it is
[44:33] this underwater that's all he knows is
[44:35] this water he can breathe there he can
[44:36] operate there one place to another place
[44:39] and when that frog comes to a full grown
[44:41] man there he goes right out of the water
[44:44] and he can get on the bank and he can
[44:46] get in the water and he can go from one
[44:48] dimension to another dimension he can go
[44:50] to work on Monday and he can go to the
[44:53] house of God on Wednesday he can come in
[44:55] and be under load but just start
[44:58] preaching the word just start preaching
[45:00] faith and that believer begins to break
[45:02] out of one dimension and go into another
[45:05] dimension because they're sons of
[45:11] God another great metamorphosis
[45:13] transform metamorphosis Greek word
[45:15] another great metamorphosis from a
[45:17] caterpillar to a butterfly and if you
[45:20] study the monarch butterfly do y'all
[45:21] know there's about four stages to the
[45:23] butterfly and when it starts out as a
[45:25] larva it begins to grow but it's not
[45:27] where it's the starts not finish at
[45:30] all but you know what it does to get
[45:32] there it eats let me say you receive the
[45:36] Holy Ghost everything you need is in you
[45:39] right
[45:40] then it's so preacher how's it get out
[45:42] of me you eat and drink and push brother
[45:46] bam said you just eat and drink and he
[45:48] said it'll come right out of you no Dove
[45:51] ever put its own feathers in its body it
[45:53] just grows them
[45:57] and when that little caterpillar starts
[45:59] developing you know what's amazing to me
[46:01] he's an Earthbound creature he's
[46:02] crawling around like a little worm but
[46:05] all of a sudden he goes up in height he
[46:07] hey man isn't it beautiful he's going up
[46:09] and he goes up a tree and I tell you
[46:11] what maybe he don't even want to go
[46:13] maybe he don't even want to move from
[46:15] where he is he likes he's comfortable
[46:16] down here secure on the ground you know
[46:19] but there's an absolute power over him
[46:22] that says you're more the ground you're
[46:23] more than this and I didn't I didn't
[46:26] make you a caterpillar I made you a
[46:28] butterfly listen God never invented a
[46:31] caterpillar as a finished stage he
[46:34] designed the butterfly the monarch
[46:36] butterfly is God's design and a
[46:39] caterpillar is just a keeps developing
[46:41] and the beautiful thing is he never has
[46:43] to add anything to
[46:45] him isn't that amazing everything added
[46:48] comes from within if he just eat he
[46:51] already has faith and knowledge and
[46:53] Temperance and kindness come on church
[46:56] every a on an apple tree is in the seed
[46:59] it just needs Water Church of the Living
[47:03] God if we just water this seed but the
[47:06] baptism of the Holy Ghost there's a
[47:08] growth that begins out inside of it and
[47:10] it begins to grow and the next thing you
[47:12] know you find yourself up there in the
[47:14] hots and a caterpillar climbs up there
[47:17] and brother brother sea it reaches out
[47:18] and hangs on to the limb and you know
[47:20] what's amazing as it hangs it naturally
[47:22] turns into a
[47:25] j yep even nature knows his name's
[47:30] Jesus isn't that beautiful it wasn't
[47:34] yosua wasn't Jehovah it wasn't any other
[47:37] kind of super spiritual name you can add
[47:39] to it just
[47:41] Jesus just even the caterpillar knows
[47:44] the power of transformation is in Jesus
[47:48] amen and you know what's amazing when he
[47:49] hangs there he develops a shell and it's
[47:52] not even a public show and he's put
[47:54] inside there and nothing else is has
[47:57] added but there's a significant change
[47:59] going on on the inside Church of the
[48:01] Living God God knew where he was going
[48:04] to begin with and God had a picture of
[48:06] you as a son and daughter of God ruling
[48:10] Supreme Over The Devil and sin and your
[48:13] flesh and there's something going on in
[48:15] you tonight it's behind the veil it's a
[48:18] third P message it is a secret thing and
[48:22] it's happening to every believer in this
[48:23] building if you begin to feed on the
[48:26] word of God you might not know when it
[48:28] happened but one day you'll wake up with
[48:31] wings and you can reach out and fire and
[48:34] go in the hot you never
[48:36] [Music]
[48:38] knew you can leave the ground power of
[48:42] the Holy
[48:45] Ghost he said preacher what are you
[48:47] getting at let me tell you what the
[48:48] object of this entire maturity you know
[48:50] what it is because God designed you to
[48:53] speak isn't that amazing what real adult
[48:57] hood is is is
[48:59] speech and when Paul gets here he says
[49:02] what
[49:05] Happ that we they speak the truth in
[49:09] love now let me say something to you do
[49:12] you
[49:13] know just don't preach on that baptism
[49:16] in the name of the Lord
[49:18] Jesus just don't teach on that
[49:20] predestination like you
[49:22] do don't you dare say that you're a
[49:25] prophet that seventh angel that you're
[49:27] saying with all the schools we have
[49:29] built to say what the seals are now
[49:30] you're going to tell us what the seals
[49:33] are but it was Commission of God and
[49:36] showed us in the scripture where his
[49:37] commission was and the third pull of his
[49:40] ministry was not prophesied it was not a
[49:42] healing it was the opening of the word
[49:45] that would take you back to the original
[49:47] state that God saw you in the beginning
[49:50] that's why the prophet said back to the
[49:53] word back to the word church back to the
[49:56] word of God back to something that can
[50:00] take you out of the flesh it can take
[50:02] you out of your moods it can take a
[50:04] church into the presence of God it
[50:06] doesn't matter how low you get this word
[50:09] can lift you into the presence of God
[50:13] get back to the word look at what he was
[50:16] screaming back to the word back to the
[50:18] word and they were building sanctuaries
[50:20] and schools and they were building great
[50:22] things and he was saying back to the
[50:24] word back to the word and they begin
[50:26] rejecting
[50:30] him and when the Great rejection came he
[50:33] went over to the book of when Deus
[50:36] forsook Paul and Paul only had one
[50:39] coat and and remember Paul's rejection
[50:41] y'all remember that isn't it amazing he
[50:44] had a man named Deus
[50:47] shakaron which that's that Kardashian
[50:49] girl it's his granddaughter just take
[50:51] the word Kardashian back it up and start
[50:53] spelling it you'll find sharan
[50:57] Deus shakarian forsook William bram's
[50:59] Ministry and his grandchildren have
[51:01] become the Fashion Queens of this
[51:04] age they took a different pattern and
[51:08] they said we don't have to listen to you
[51:10] what you say about women cutting their
[51:12] hair and how they're supposed to dress
[51:13] who are you to say we're we're we're
[51:16] shouting we're speaking in tongues we're
[51:18] doing what we want we got the spirit
[51:19] moving how who are you to say that we're
[51:22] baptizing wrong spirit moves in our
[51:24] church every night who are you to say
[51:26] that we got predestination wrong do you
[51:29] do you see what was going on back
[51:32] there they were actually had great signs
[51:36] and wonders all around brother Brandon
[51:38] when he started preaching the
[51:40] message and he started saying this is
[51:43] the truth on this and this is the truth
[51:45] on this and this is the truth on this
[51:47] and this is the truth on this and
[51:49] brother Bram said and then all of the
[51:51] sudden I began to get a
[51:53] complex y'all remember he began to get a
[51:57] complex and he decided that he was going
[51:59] to pull off the field and going to go up
[52:01] in the mountains I'll make a short long
[52:03] story very short he was just going to
[52:05] pull off the mountain brother Mark I
[52:08] know you've never felt like doing that
[52:11] know it's never been none of these men
[52:13] of gods ever felt that brother Bram was
[52:14] Li himself in that you
[52:17] know and being factious
[52:22] very but when he got his mind all made
[52:24] up how he was going to get out of it you
[52:26] remember what he did he said he said he
[52:28] he he was he had that dream of him and
[52:30] his brother-in-law how many knows the
[52:31] dream I want to see your hands so I know
[52:33] how much of it to tell you know the
[52:34] dream he's talking about brother Braham
[52:37] had a dream of his brother-in-law who
[52:38] had become a
[52:39] drunk and he and he didn't have anything
[52:42] brother Braham said he didn't had a
[52:42] place to live nothing else he was a bum
[52:44] basically and brother Braham had a dream
[52:46] that he was with his brother-in-law his
[52:47] drunk bum and they were out in a trash
[52:50] pile and he said they didn't have a home
[52:52] they didn't have any money they were
[52:53] just sitting around an old fire and he
[52:56] said his brother-in-law invited him to
[52:57] his fire and give him a home brother bam
[52:59] said now he said I wondered what that
[53:01] dream meant and he said a little while
[53:03] later he said I was out in I think it
[53:05] was in Montana wasn't the state he's in
[53:06] Montana he was out in Montana with Billy
[53:08] Paul and he said we walked into a
[53:10] restaurant early one morning and he said
[53:12] I still had this on my mind I was going
[53:13] to leave the field and go up here and he
[53:15] said and I was sitting there think about
[53:16] and this big mountain man walked in the
[53:18] room and he said he was a real Burly
[53:22] farmer Ranch Hand kind of guy not
[53:24] Mountain Man Rancher sorry and he said
[53:26] said he said when I seen him he said I
[53:28] thought that think you can be what you
[53:30] want to be but all of a sudden brother B
[53:32] said when I watched that guy had great
[53:34] and just admiration for him he looked
[53:36] like he had a little money and he was
[53:38] dressed nice and he was just a man's man
[53:40] he said and all of the sudden he said I
[53:42] heard a commotion he said looked over
[53:45] and he said to my right looked over
[53:47] there to my right and he said there
[53:49] there it was he said there was me and
[53:51] Fletcher he said there was a guy looked
[53:53] just like me and a guy that looked just
[53:55] like Fletcher and he said as we were
[53:58] sitting there he said Billy said Daddy
[54:00] there's you in Fletcher right there and
[54:02] then while he was and then while he was
[54:04] talking to him he said they couldn't
[54:06] even get enough money for breakfast he
[54:08] said they maybe had enough money between
[54:10] them to have a maybe to have a coffee or
[54:12] something and he said I was sitting
[54:14] there watching it and he said a voice
[54:16] spoke to me and he said no that's what
[54:19] you're going to
[54:20] be isn't it amazing that brother Bram
[54:23] had himself figured out to be one thing
[54:25] but God said if you do what's on your
[54:27] mind that's what you're going to be see
[54:31] without
[54:32] god without God you as a Believer are
[54:35] not going to be what you think you're
[54:36] going to be when you make up your mind
[54:39] that you're not going to serve God's
[54:41] purpose for your life you're not going
[54:43] to be what you think you can be without
[54:45] God you are
[54:48] nothing without God you're nothing but
[54:52] with God look brother Bram then he turns
[54:54] remember he turns and goes down the road
[54:56] and looks and God said there it is I
[54:58] wrote your name in the mountains that
[55:00] Elijah spirit that mountain was his
[55:03] Bible and he said there my name was
[55:05] written brandom and he said three of
[55:06] them Peaks and b r a n h a m there them
[55:10] there them mountains was now young men I
[55:11] want tell you something them mountains
[55:13] were there before brother brand was born
[55:15] do you know them mountains was there and
[55:17] there were seven mountain peaks before
[55:19] William Brandon was ever born and then
[55:22] God had you on his mind before Abraham
[55:25] ever had an Ang change because there
[55:27] would be a seven lettered man with h m
[55:30] come in the end time with a message of
[55:33] adoption to the Church of the Living God
[55:36] something that would position the church
[55:38] in the word of God and there his name
[55:41] was in them mountains and brother Ram
[55:43] said I heard the voice say you are more
[55:45] than a prophet that's John the Baptist
[55:48] you're more than a prophet and brother
[55:50] man said right there it was now I
[55:53] understood what that prophecy was over
[55:56] my life because thou H chose the harder
[55:59] way that that great decision will be the
[56:03] victory in love divine I'm not off of my
[56:08] subject the victory in love divine was
[56:11] William brandom deciding to preach the
[56:14] truth even under
[56:16] rejection even when the Pentecostals
[56:19] were leaving him by The Groves he

[1:00:56] and because you got a different parent
[1:00:57] now you're under that
[1:00:59] word speaking the
[1:01:04] truth see the Capstone Ministry of
[1:01:08] William brandom was to tell the truth of
[1:01:13] the word of
[1:01:15] God is't that
[1:01:17] amazing the great victory in
[1:01:20] love was to speak the truth
[1:01:27] somebody said brother Wayne I can't
[1:01:28] preach that baptism in the Holy Ghost
[1:01:29] you don't love the people
[1:01:33] then somebody said well you know you get
[1:01:36] among a bunch of intellects and they
[1:01:38] it's odd because some of the things I'm
[1:01:39] teaching tonight I've heard intellects
[1:01:40] teach you know we're in the bright age
[1:01:42] and we're past emotion and and and they
[1:01:44] get out there in that realm where God
[1:01:45] don't move no more and it's
[1:01:49] just how could you love people and not
[1:01:52] offer them the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:01:56] how could you love people and not offer
[1:01:58] them an experience with a living
[1:02:02] God how how could you honestly love
[1:02:05] people and not tell them the full
[1:02:06] counsel of God that a man a man can get
[1:02:10] so in the presence of God that he can
[1:02:13] lose his
[1:02:15] senses that he can forget what his name
[1:02:17] is do yall know brother R said you
[1:02:19] already to get in god like that he said
[1:02:21] you ought to get so far in God you lose
[1:02:23] you in the spirit see Love Will Tell the
[1:02:27] whole
[1:02:29] truth love love love will make you tell
[1:02:31] the truth when it's in a place that
[1:02:34] don't want to hear
[1:02:38] truth you
[1:02:41] see speaking the truth in
[1:02:45] love it's time to tell the truth about
[1:02:48] who you are just tell it quit being
[1:02:51] ashamed of it just tell the devil I hey
[1:02:54] look God called me
[1:02:57] I never will forget I never will forget
[1:02:59] this now Satan will challenge you and
[1:03:00] you you ministers know what I'm talking
[1:03:02] about I remember some the first times I
[1:03:03] was
[1:03:04] overseas and Demon spirits come up and
[1:03:07] and now demons man if you've never seen
[1:03:09] it it still happens demon manifestation
[1:03:12] they brought her up in the prayer line
[1:03:14] they used to be on video I don't know
[1:03:15] what I did with it brother Hunter was
[1:03:17] there he watched it happen we stood
[1:03:19] there and work with that woman 25
[1:03:21] minutes or so and the power of God come
[1:03:23] into that room
[1:03:26] and it so delivered that
[1:03:29] woman that she she walked out of there
[1:03:31] completely
[1:03:34] free because the truth is that this this
[1:03:37] gospel still has
[1:03:40] power it still can deliver
[1:03:43] Hearts we don't need to replace the
[1:03:46] gospel for psychology
[1:03:48] friends we don't need to get more
[1:03:51] intellectual we need to speak the
[1:03:54] truth speak the truth about who God made

[1:04:51] love Capstone Ministry of William bradam
[1:04:55] he was rejected for the opening of the
[1:04:59] seals but as Jesus went to Calvary what
[1:05:02] was it it was divine
[1:05:03] love projecting Sovereign
[1:05:07] Grace this message
[1:05:09] projected Sovereign Grace at the
[1:05:12] Capstone
[1:05:14] crying Grace Grace can you imagine where
[1:05:16] you'd be tonight without the message of

[1:05:44] Wayne how how does it how is it bondage
[1:05:46] I'll tell you how it's
[1:05:49] bondage if if you get into a
[1:05:52] place where you can't just say what a
[1:05:55] prophet said about about something it's
[1:06:00] bondage
[1:06:03] just we come out of that
[1:06:08] already already been
[1:06:12] there and as a full grown
[1:06:15] son speak the

[1:06:30] of
[1:06:30] [Music]
[1:06:31] God you ever notice that how the devil
[1:06:33] will put certain certain quotes in the
[1:06:36] message you ever knows how a devil do
[1:06:38] that it'll come up to you and all of a
[1:06:40] sudden you'll feel a little fear about

[1:07:02] says that she would be the final voice
[1:07:03] of the final age and that she would say
[1:07:07] what the messenger said the spirit the
[1:07:11] prophet the bride would say the same
[1:07:13] thing is't that amazing say say why does
