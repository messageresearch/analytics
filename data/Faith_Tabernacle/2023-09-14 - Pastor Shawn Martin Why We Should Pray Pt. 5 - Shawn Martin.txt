in prayer and the Lord will just use him in a great way want to keep the ministry around the world that's preaching this message uh just keep him in our prayer amen and do all that we can for the Lord

in the service and move by your spirit Lord you see every need that is present Lord and you know how to meet the need and I pray Lord that you just give us a fresh anointing and your word father and may you speak to every heart tonight we ask it in Jesus Christ's name amen and amen First Corinthians the 14th chapter and praise the Lord the 15th verse I believe it is yeah but it says what is it then I will pray with the spirit and I will pray with the understanding also I will sing with the spirit and I will sing with the understanding also amen you can have your seeds we've just been um um talking on on prayer and um it Thrills my heart to to know the age the time that we're living in and that we are the manifestation of God's thoughts today and everything that God had thought of we are the sons and daughters of God that he saw before the foundation of the world and to know that we are in the position today we if if there's ever a people that are in position to have fellowship with him as he desired to have in the beginning we are that that group of people this is what he's worked for this is what he's longed for God loves to have Fellowship and you could see why Satan does all he can to keep us busy keep his occupied with other things but he he loves fellowship and in his mind he purpose to have Fellowship now brother Branham gives the simple uh definition I guess or Bosworth uh the fellowship is Two Fellas of the same ship which is is saying basically they they share a mutual bond they have uh the same understanding it's it's a it's they have something in common and I think this is where we're at uh in this day as Sons and Daughters of God prayer is a way for us to have Fellowship uh with God um prayer is our acknowledgment of God the Bible talks about in all thy ways acknowledge Him and He Shall direct your paths well that's that's prayer first Peter 5 and 7 as well it says casting all your care upon him for he careth for you if we could really understand the passion that God has the desire that God has for for us sometimes we think it's all one-sided that maybe we love God and we we want God and we want a fellowship with God but God knows nothing about us but that's not true God's wanted Fellowship way before we ever desired Fellowship and and as the the I believe it was the prophet that said he wants to hear you a thousand times more than you wanted before you could ever desire it God God desired it everything and and and so therefore casting all your care upon him for he cares for you you see when we come to Christ it's it's a place just to let off the pressure there's so much pressure in the world today so many things that people don't know what to do and where to go and how to handle things and uh on and on and on but but when you come to Christ it's it's a it's a time just to let off the pressure it's a time and I think this is why we need to pray but it's also as the prophet would tell us that it's God's provided place of safety in times of sickness and Times of of trouble in times of turmoil you can go to Christ you can come to him and just let off all that pressure amen because you know you have this understanding that he cares for you and so everything that we would have need of is in Christ Christ is our everything do you believe that Christ is our everything so when we come into prayer we we're having this understanding that Christ is is everything that we have need of he's our satisfaction he's our he's he's our provider he's our sustainer and and all these things so the prophet says that Christ took your worry that you wouldn't have to do it hey man that's that's right and so he says don't don't worry about your cares for that's his business ain't that right so if you notice we're invited to come boldly before the throne of grace amen not to complain not to Grumble not not to manipulate not nodding these things but we're invited to come boldly before the throne of grace to find help in time of need help he's got needs I think as humans we've all got needs and so God provided a channel God provided a way that we could come and to find the help now you know we can come boldly because of the work of redemption we must never take that lightly of the work of redemption lightly and and as the prophet told us the Redemption is to bring back to its original condition so then it's in this day as as the lamb has come he's already done the work of redemption but it's in this day he came with an open book and it's to claim what he is already redeemed if if you're filling a pull whatsoever it's it's because it's christ-lane claim to you he's bringing you unto himself the Bible says it was God in Christ reconciling the world unto himself and so God through this work of redemption it was to reconcile us back to have fellowship with him do you believe that so we have been brought back in the fellowship just as Adam had that that Fellowship but I believe that we have a greater understanding a greater Fellowship they uh then then what what Adam had and it brings us into a more intimate Fellowship than than Adam had with God Adam prayed in in the garden uh there and and uh you know the the prophet told us of how that they would uh him and Eve would just go and have fellowship with God in the cool of the evening and how that God desired he longed for that time of the day and Adam and Eve long for that time of day just to to run in in the garden and and and go to that certain place that they met with God and and have fellowship and communion with with the Lord and they they stayed in fellowship with him ain't that right and so man now if you if you don't stay in fellowship with God you'll dry up in your spiritual walk with the Lord a man the prophet said you you if you don't keep that prayer life going and so Adam communed and he fellowshipped with God and and the sake of the communion that he had he was able to do it without any sin in his life for he had never sinned a man he he prayed without any interference uh uh from Satan for Satan had not yet the power that he has today he was not able to inflict Adam with mind battles he was not able to inflict Adam with uh diseases and sickness and fear and dread and worry and all of these things Adam was able to fellowship with God and and not have any interference from Satan he he he he prayed with an understanding that he was a Son of God he prayed having an understanding of his position he he prayed understanding that his words had power I I I think that when Adam commune with God fear wasn't mixed with his words uh worry wasn't mixed with his prayer unbelief wasn't mixed uh uh with the the communion that Adam had with God can you say man amen and so uh Adam when he prayed to God uh he didn't have to have a blood sacrifice because he hadn't sinned yet it was a communion with God it was what what a fellowship what a what a joy it must have been just to go to God and and talk with him ain't that right Adam he prayed as a Son of God not as a sinner he prayed as a son of God he fellowshipped as a son not as a sinner so you can you can see the kind of Fellowship that God wants to have with you and I a fellowship that that not not he wants a fellowship where there's no worry involved he wants a fellowship where there's no unbelief involved he wants a fellowship a man where there's not anxiety involved can you say man a man he wants a fellowship see and and so uh uh he he wants us to come and and in our prayer be as a son and daughter of God and not as a sinner you see when man sinned the holy image of God left him his understanding became darkened and I I look to hear in Ephesians 4 17. Paul speaking of the Gentiles say this I say therefore and testify in the Lord that you walk you henceforth walk not as other Gentiles walk in the vanity of their mind having the understanding darkened being alienated from the life of God through the ignorance that is in them because of the blindness of their heart ain't that right now Paul talking of the Gentiles here but I can't help but believe that this was the condition of all men a man when after after the fall amen I believe that Abel was even in this same condition until God opened the eyes of his understanding by revelation you see if there's any understanding it's going to take God to open our eyes it's not something that you you ain't going to get this kind of understanding through Seminary you're not going to get this kind of understanding just just uh my church or or even even reading the Bible it's it's all of these things are important I'm sure but God has to give the understanding and that understanding comes by Revelation ain't that right and if you you look in the in in the Hebrews uh there the 11th chapter by Faith by faith talks about Abraham by faith it talks about Noah by faith and Moses by faith and every one of these we call it the faith chapter and and all these things but what it was what God would Enlighten their understanding he enlightens them in in in some way or another and and uh and and so uh uh it takes God to give the understanding but but even after the fall man has always prayed and and worshiped and you know the majority of prayers have been offered throughout time without any understanding many men prayed today without understanding they've been throughout years and years of all through the history of mankind it's prayer has been offered up without understanding the majority of men who have prayed have done so not having an understanding of God they have prayed without understanding of who he is and what he is they have prayed without understanding his Redemptive work not understanding his power his faithfulness his love not understanding his mind not understanding the difference between a sinner and a saint amen many many prayers have been offered not understanding the grace of God amen not understanding the promises of God can you say man and and it's because man has become alienated from from from God it was the sin that that that kept man uh in in that in that condition and and so all kinds of prayers have been uttered sorrowful prayers mournful prayers faithless prayers unintelligent prayers and all these things and and it just shows uh just how estranged the relationship between God and man is and this word estranged is having lost former closeness and affection in a state of alienation from a previous close or familial uh relationship and so so I I think our prayers can you can tell by our walk with God by our prayers you can tell of our understanding of God by our prayers amen and and so uh uh with all of these things God doesn't just want a prayer uttered a man he wants us to pray with understanding he doesn't want us just to be churchgoers but he wants us to come and and have understanding he doesn't want us just to worship he wants us to worship with understanding he doesn't want us just to read the word but he wants us to read the word with understanding he doesn't want us just to say man to something he wants us to say Amen with understanding it it there has to be an understanding to this can you say man and and so God has made it to where we don't have to be estranged from him and and Ephesians 2 and 12 uh through 16 it says that at that time you were without Christ being aliens uh from the Commonwealth of Israel and strangers from the covenants a promise having no hope and with god without God in the world but now everybody say now in Christ Jesus ye who sometimes were far off are made not by the blood of Christ for he is our peace who hath made both one and hath broken down the middle wall a partition between us having abolished in his flesh the enmity even the law of Commandments or contained in ordinance for to make in himself of Twain one new man so making peace and that he might reconcile both unto God in one body by the cross having slain the enmity thereby ain't that right so we're made we're we're made drug now unto God by the blood here's Hebrews 7 and 14 for the law made nothing perfect but the bringing in of a better hope did by the which we draw nigh unto God now you think of that so God been working all these time seeking a Reconciliation to bring us back and not just to make us church goers not to make us just uh uh having a form of Holiness or a form of godliness but to bring us back into relationship and fellowship and where we could have a greater understanding of God than what Even Adam had so we draw Night by the blood of Jesus Christ therefore we are not to keep praying a sinner's prayer every time we pray can you say Amen we're not Sinners no more ain't that right that's right you know brother Branham he says God looking through the blood he doesn't see you no more as a sinner he sees you redeemed amen you're redeemed because he always everybody say always sees you through Christ that's the reason we can be perfect not perfect in the sense of sinless we're perfect in the eyes of God when we're in Christ another place brother Brown said I might be a sinner in your sight but if I'm in Christ God don't see it because his sins atoned or his blood a toned for my sins there see I can't sin can you say that with me I can't sin I can't sin he that's born of God does not commit sin for he cannot sin the seed of God remains in him if he makes a mistake sure he's right then willing to confess it if he's a real Christian he will do it if he holds it back it shows he ain't got nothing in the first place he hasn't got nothing to begin with can you say man see so so we're looking that that God wanting a fellowship not with just human beings but with his children with his children and not to come as as one him holy and we're unrighteous and and we don't have a clue as to who he is because your sin would keep him keep you from him yeah ain't that right but God would make an atonement to where you would become righteous just as he is that you would become holy just as he is and that God would look at you as a sinner but he would look at you as righteous as holy through the blood of Jesus Christ so now you can come boldly ain't that right brother Brown says the church seems to be so scared of things but he says you got nothing to be scared about can you say that with me I got nothing to be scared about nearly the the first word that Jesus said after his resurrection was fear not fear not why he took the fear away he took the anxiety away so brother Brown said don't get scared there ain't nothing going to happen nothing can happen nothing can bother a Christian not even death itself can even touch the Christian he that heareth my words and believeth on him that sent me hath everlasting life and shall not everybody say shall not come into condemnation but has passed from Death unto life so therefore death has no Reign on a Christian ain't that right so then brother Bram says what a faith that ought to build up in the people something that'll told the mark ain't that right you don't want your prayer to be wishy-washy you don't want your faith to be wishy-washy God's looking for somebody that'll told the mark ain't that right now you know good and well he's not going to keep you from challenges he ain't going to keep the mountains from coming up against you he's not going to keep the Giants from from bothering you he ain't gonna keep the enemy away from you but he wants somebody that'll trust him have enough understanding of his work of redemption can you say Amen have enough understanding of his love and of his purpose and of his will for their lives that they could have the faith to stand there and go toe-to-toe with the Devil so he says you'll never get nothing by being a little jellyfish Christian he said did you ever see a jellyfish you just hit him and he'll splatter all over everything see a jellyfish you know what usually eats them he says the crabs and things along the side of the seashore comes up with his pincher and cuts him in two and takes him down because the jellyfish just lays there brother we need some Christians not jellyfish but Christians with the backbone that'll stand ain't that right he's I don't mean to I don't mean to fuss with people but stand everybody say stand for your god-given rights that Christ died for can you say amen amen that's why you can cast all your care upon him for he made a way that you could do so you're justified in doing it you know that you're justified in taking all your cares and casting it upon him ain't that right amen so as Sons and Daughters of God our word should have power amen we should believe that we should understand that not as sons of Adam but sons of God see for the word is in our mouth we've quoted this James 5 16 the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man of veileth much ain't that right fervent prayer the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man of veileth much we've read this before Mark 11 22 and Jesus answering Seth unto them have faith in God for verily I say unto you that whosoever shall say unto this mountain be thou removed and be thou cast into the sea shall not doubt in his heart but shall believe that those things which he's saith shall come to pass he shall have whatsoever he saith he shall have not might he shall he shall have therefore I say unto you what things so ever you desire When you pray believe that you receive them and you shall have them ain't that right so now you're coming with a a a a boldness you're coming with the confidence you're coming with an understanding that whatever I ask whatever I speak amen my words will have power they they are affect us ain't that right yes sir the only way that your words can have power or be effective When you pray is nothing condemning you and First John 3 and 20 it says if our heart condemn us God is greater than our heart and knoweth all things beloved if our heart condemneth not then we have confidence toward God ain't that right so so what we want is we want confidence with our prayer we want confidence we we we we don't want to take these things lightly we want we don't want to take our prayer lightly we don't want to take the the thing that God has given us for granted ain't that right some trust in chariots some trusting horses some trusting this and this and that but we trust in the name of the Lord we've got the greatest weapon in our hands and that's prayer ain't that right so therefore now you're coming you're not coming worrying you're not coming you're not coming uh uh uh with unbelief you're not coming questioning god well can you really do that no he's bringing us back to what Adam was in in the beginning and what was Adam in the beginning Satan had no control over him Satan could not touch him Satan could not affect him can you say Amen now God's made it to where you know well anyway so so we got to have faith and and brother Brian said how can you have faith when you know you're not walking in his word when you know there's things there that you ought to say and you don't say it there's things there you ought to teach and you don't teach it there's things there you can't say and how can you have faith when you know you're wrong ain't that right he says another place if I regard iniquity in my heart then God will not hear my prayer said David so what is Iniquity iniquity is something that you know that you're doing that you ought not to do and still won't repent of it see if I regard iniquity in my heart knowing that I should do it I don't do it see then God promised the bible promises that God will not hear your prayer if you know that you should do it and won't do it ain't that right so then he says stay with that word now I can tell you what you need to do but if you stay with the word of God I can't condemn your heart God can condemn your heart and if you're not walking in the word there's that condemnation that strikes there especially if you're a son and daughter of God ain't that right so stay with the word because we want our prayers to be effective ain't that right and this is the whole point of the restoration of the word of God in this day that there would not be any confusion as to what to believe and what not to believe ain't that right because we're coming back to perfect fellowship with God a perfect Faith with God we see that God has Vindicated it time and time and time again and we can rest our faith in that without questions ain't that right so stay the prophet said stay with that word where there's nothing condemned now Romans 8 and 1 Paul would tell us there is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit amen don't walk after the flesh but walk after the spirit and the spirit leads with the word the spirit comes from the word ain't that right because Brother Brad said it can only come out of the word the spirit can only come out of the word his word is spirit ain't that right so he says the real true spirit of God can only speak the word of God so walk after the spirit not after the flesh the flesh will deny it the flesh will deny everything it's got your feelings the sensations and and and the carnal and the enmities and and all of these things it works against God yeah it's so easily lured by the things of the world and and and there's so much condemnation in them things ain't that right so then when you come into prayer and and your heart is condemning you well well you you you ain't gonna get nowhere because you cannot the Bible says it you cannot believe you cannot have confidence as long as there's something hid in your heart so we got to get all that cleaned out ain't that right so then when when when all of the sin and when all of the iniquity is out of our heart then watch your prayer go to work brother man says see then don't be afraid to say to this mountain be moved say it stay there and watch her crumble and you say man see it's not just now an utterance of words but there's power in them words it's it's just not going through the routine routine of prayer and getting up and nothing is happening but now you are a son of God you've been restored back into Fellowship ain't that right now he says see stay there and watch her crumble that's right but if you got any condemnation there you better keep still for you're just babbling then so we don't want to just Babble in our prayer well I pray you know I pray every morning every night and every noon and I just pray pray pray that's fine but are your words babbling are you just babbling or are you getting somewhere with God can you say man he said see uh uh if you got any condemnation there you better keep still you're just babbling then you're not saying the truth you're not saying the things that you should say ain't that right so now uh not to keep you much longer but if you notice after man it's sinned then he marred his soul in darkness and Blackness came into it and brother Brown says then God came down and lived in man suffered with man to redeem man and the Holy Spirit comes into man and drives that Blackness and sin away from him aren't you glad for that aren't you glad that you have no Blackness and sin God drove it all away oh my see when he sinned the holy image of God left him his channels become clawed his understanding become darkened oh and it's so true now amen see and now he says the Holy Spirit comes into man and drives that Blackness and sin away from him and brings it back into perfect Fellowship a part of God and now we by the blood of Christ who cleanses us from sins we become Sons and Daughters of God who is God the one that stood there and rolled Stars off of his hands and rode worlds out of his hands and made the things which do not appear deity and deity himself lives in man the Creator that made Heaven and Earth lives in mankind why no wonder cripples see when you realize that can't straighten out the Creator's here no wonder blind when they can't see opens up and and and because the Creator is here can you say Amen you see that that's what causes the blind eyes to see is the creators here that's that's what causes the to walk that's what causes the death to hear that's that's what causes the mountains move to move is the creator is here where in you he's come to abide in you ain't that right now it's no longer Christ in his Corporal body a man speaking Lazarus come forth but now there's that same authoritative voice that is in you as a Son of God that when you speak even death can give it up death has no hold over a child of God true amen he says see we the Bible said we are Sons and Daughters of God his offspring then we're something like God was Jesus said himself it is written you are Gods written in your law see we become a part of God a Son of God by adoption through Jesus Christ now this is the greatest our understanding is becoming greater than we've ever had in the history of mankind in my opinion and my belief because this is the time of adoption Brother Brad plainly tells us there was no other time of adoption outside this time ain't that right even what they done on the day of Pentecost and in the book of Acts that was only a seed that was seed the potential was there but now we are we have come back to see it again but we're the ripening we're the ripen can you say man and and so uh as we're ripening in this presence of the son of uh uh in the s-o-n amen we're taking on adoption hello Church where adoption's not far from you I believe adoption is here I believe the spirit of adoption is here I believe that people are the sons and daughters are are being adopted a man in this age for this is the age of adoption ain't that right and we become part of God now you always was the son of God but notice you're taking on uh uh rulership you're taking on Authority as a Son of God now you're taking over the father's business because you know uh you you watched and studied how the father would conduct his business now you're conducting the business as the father would the father just steps back and lets you lest the sun take over and the and and it will in this case the father hides himself in the Sun Sons and Daughters can you say Amen we become part of God a Son of God by adoption through Jesus Christ therefore if you realize if you realize that the very God that made the dirt and the Earth and whatever's here is living among men where is our faith at and you say man I hope I'm making sense to you but where's our faith at what faith should we have faith in in God oh yeah I know God can do it or faith in what you are faith in your words faith in your prayer faith in your in what you are as a son of God can you say Amen I've said it before you know brother Brandon talks with the two faith of the the Jew and the the Gentile Jarius he told Jesus he said my daughter's sick if you just come and lay your hands he said I'll do that then later on the the Centurion you know he he just said I'm not worthy that you'd come under my roof if you just speak the word and it was two types of faith but you know as I studied reading that and studying it a while back it it just it just come clear to me and you take it whatever but but that that was the faith of the Jew that was the faith of the the the the Gentile but then there was the faith that Jesus had himself Jesus wouldn't have went over and laid hands if he didn't have the faith Jesus wouldn't have spoke the word if he didn't have the faith Jesus wouldn't have even went to the grave of Lazarus if he didn't have faith but where was his faith he had Faith the prophet will talk about in perfect Faith he had faith in who he was right the Jew had faith in his touch the Centurion had faith in his word but Jesus had faith in who he was ain't that right and if we realize that we are the prophecy if we realize that what God had in the behind her part of his mind we are the manifestation of that then our faith is in what we are in what the word says we are and you say man see how how that makes our prayers different that makes our approach to God different so he said see Jesus said the things that I do when he was on Earth greater shall you do for I go into my father whatsoever things you desire When you pray believe that you receive them and you shall have them that's the Creator speaking is that right then it doesn't lay in him it lays in US ain't that right then we in Fellowship what Adam lost in the fall Christ restored in his death to bring man back into fellowship with God now the church has moved up to that fellowship with God communion like Adam had in the beginning In the Garden of Eden taken away all sin free from condemnation the Holy Spirit cleansing us from all sin now everybody say now you're free to exercise the next step in God that's what the prophet said no no no no no condemnation no sin you've been cleansed how many has been cleansed amen you didn't walk in here a sinner if you did you need to get saved that you didn't come in here a sinner you're not worshiping as a sinner you're not saying amen as a sinner you're not praying as a sinner you're not uh singing as a sinner I'm not preaching as a sinner not playing music as a sinner we are Sons and Daughters of God that God has cleansed with his own blood and sealed us with the Holy Ghost can you say Amen now we're free to exercise the next step in God so now notice what the prophet said if our heart condemns us there's no need of coming across the platform there's no need of asking God for anything because you don't have the faith to receive it but when you have met every requirement that God requires then Faith steps out there see Faith automatically steps out there Faith steps out there and says God is God I've met the requirements can you say Amen now we all have to ask forgiveness on a daily basis amen because we make we make mistakes and we well the prophet said we backslide every day but here in Ephesians 1 5 we talked on it before but Ephesians 1 5 having predestinated us into the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he hath made us accepted in the Beloved aren't you glad for that he hath made us not a priest not Pope not not not preacher God made us accepted Christ made us accepted in whom we have Redemption through his blood the Forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace now you know Paul is talking to the Saints who are in Christ Jesus he's not talking to those outside of Christ talking to those that are in ain't that right so Christians sin but they're not sinners the brand said Christian sins Christians sin but a sinner cannot sin a sinner doesn't sin because he's a sinner he's just a sinner to begin with and that's all see here he said take the back of this book it's black how much of that you know you you it's all black you can't just say part of it's black whatever it's all black so he said see the whole thing it's all black that's the way a sinner is he's just condemned to start with well you say well what about if he commits adultery what if he ravishes a woman what if he gambles what if he shoots somebody that's none of our business see that's none of our business we got laws down here to take care of that we're not reformers we're preachers of the Gospel so we don't condemn him for what he's done we don't condemn him for committing adultery we condemn him because he's a sinner if he was a Christian he wouldn't do it that's right if he's been changed he won't do that because he's a sinner that's what makes him do that can you say man so we you are sealed with all the ghosts we're not Sinners we are Sons and Daughters of God ain't that right now God fellowshipped with Adam knowing he could sin but God fellowships with you and I knowing we can't sin can you say Amen God fellowships With Us what a relationship that we have with God how secure we are knowing that we cannot fall God Fellowship without him knowing that he could fall knowing that he would fall that God fellowships With Us knowing we cannot fall we we cannot go back because we've been sealed unto the day of our Redemption and you say Amen brother Graham talks about Eve and how that God told her not to do such and such and she turned around and listened to the devil and she listened to him and and done exactly what God told her not to do but he says but the Eve in this last day is not going to do it thank you because she's predestinated not to do it yes sir God is going to do it he knows he'll have it see he said he'd have a church without spot wrinkle or blemish she's going to stand there in the Splendor of him his word may manifest and she'll be a talk into the world well he didn't say that about he but he says it about you can you say Amen and if a man God would have fellowship with a man knowing he would fall how much more Fellowship do you have with him of his work of redemption claimed you Brown said a man that's born of God cannot sin he does not sin there's no way for him to sin how can it be a sinner and redeemed at the same time how can I be in the pawn shop and out of the pawn shop at the same time he redeemed Us by his blood by his Spirit he cleansed us and then comes to dwell in us the church not the denomination now the church ain't that right so here Proverbs 24 16 it says that just man fall of seven times and riseth up again he falls down seven times and yet he's still not a sinner he rises back up again can you say amen and God can have think of that amen God can have fellowship with us therefore you cannot pray as a sinner amen you love the Lord amen you say well I prayed I prayed and the musicians can come you say well I you know I've and I'm not getting anywhere what's wrong you know I believe that if your heart condemns you you know it it condemns you and what it does it convicts you it doesn't it doesn't it doesn't make you unworthy it doesn't say that you're unworthy there's a difference really in condemnation and conviction condemnation Works death conviction brings to repentance and brings life ain't that right so when your heart is comes under a conviction and it tells you you're not doing this and you should be doing this and you know better and you know that way you can't have faith with God your faith won't be there it just won't the Bible says it it won't you won't be able to have confidence but then when you you've got a blood and brother Brown says there's that blood that that keeps us covered all the time because we're so stupid and we're going to make we're going to make mistakes as we go through life ain't that right but then you know if your heart doesn't condemn you you know it's it's you're you're you're you got the desire to serve God you're you're walking in the word you're you're you're believing everything that God would say by the prophet but then you say well but but my prayer ain't getting answered well that's when you got to stay and that's where you got to keep hanging in there because brother Brown says I believe God hears prayer but God don't always have to answer prayer right then [Music] God answers in his own time and I think that's where the matured Sons and Daughters of God we're having this understanding when we come to prayer we're not we're not we're not moving God to answer right then we're not saying all right God you better do it now I'm you know no that's that's a little kid that that's a little child demanding his way but as matured sons of God we have this understanding that it doesn't matter if it's tomorrow it doesn't matter if he does it a month from now it doesn't matter God everything will work out according to his time and there's no weapon formed against us that's going to prosper it looked as though God Christ Jesus came four days late for Lazarus but in all reality he come right on time ain't that right so we have this understanding as sons of God because now we have the mind of Christ that God does not work all the time when we think he ought to work and and and it seems like when everything is about to fall apart we just have this understanding he'll answer our prayer in his own time he's gonna answer so God answers in his own time brother Brown said if you've asked him and believe him then he will answer in his own time and you say man so I imagine he said see when they was praying talking about the four Hebrew children he says when they when they was praying he said I can see the Angels standing around the Throne of God where God was setting saying they're in prayer they're under strain and God replies oh yeah I know but they'll hold out true I've Got Confidence in them they're my servant Abraham's seed so they'll hold true so a lot of times God is bragging on us God is bragging because God's got confidence in you as a Son of God God's got confidence in you as a daughter of God he knows ain't that right then we understand that in his wisdom he's got wisdom he's got a reason for not answering right away he's got a reason for not doing things the way we want him to do and we think it ought to be done this way so then we with understanding knowing that we're praying to a wise God we're fellowshipping the all-wise God and when he moves he moves according to his wisdom and his understanding you love him in the Lord wonderful God bless you brother Brown said this I will read this he says if you abide in me he is the word see my words abiding in you you can ask what you will I know see then if if Christianity was the word of God see and he was the word and by accepting the word and the word lived through him then I know if he abide in me and my word in you ask what you will and if you are in the word and part of the word you'll only ask if I say you'll only ask you'll only ask what the word tells you to ask [Music] know the day you're living then and ask accordingly can you say Amen see now your prayer is is word based the word based he promised his supply all your needs is that right but you say oh God if you just bless me with the Mercedes that's not what he promised he promised he'd Supply your needs can you say man so then you ask according to his word you're not asking a miss something evily why because you have understanding as the Son of God in church if we could only realize that this message has brought us up to an understanding a man that we can now have a a a a heart-to-heart talk if we could say it that way with our father and and the understanding and the relationship grows and deepens and and and and the father now is able to commit the kingdom into our hands knowing that we're not going to ask you know for for crazy things and things outside his word and and and just you know things that he cannot back up we're not going to ask prayers that he cannot support and back up it'll be prayers according to his will according to his promises prayers that he has promised and oh there's a lot of promises there that we can look and say father you promised them cast all my cares upon you we have in this fellowship with our father oh God help us to have that understanding of Who We Are that he loves us we love him and there's nothing there keeping that keeping us from him he's done everything he can to open up his arms wide and and to have that relationship that when we would talk he could hear and he could answer aren't you glad for that can you lift your hands and just worship Our Father oh we're so thankful Lord for the relationship that we have with you and that blood sacrifice that you have established on our behalf that blood speaking for us Lord that we come to you and say oh Father forgive us of our sins oh there's a blood that is immediately there atoning for us Lord oh and we can immediately come into your presence and ask what we will oh Father asking according to your promise knowing and having the understanding of your word for this age father we love you we thank you again thank you enough Lord for your goodness to us hallelujah hallelujah I
