Paul says be ye followers of me even as I also am of Christ follow me now as as I follow Christ Now Praise You Brethren that you remember me in all things to keep the ordinances as I delivered unto you now verse 3 but I would have you to know that the head of every man is Christ and the head of the woman is the man and the head of Christ is God now if we stop right there we got all the text we need for uh preaching on a headship but never aspect of headship but now what would happen if we read the next verse verse 4. every man now he's talking about man praying or prophesying having his head covered he's talking about his own part of his body his Cranium his head Dishonored his head which is Christ we just said in verse three his head is Christ now in verse 5 now what if we read verse 5. but every woman now the woman now that prayeth or prophesied with her head her physical head her Cranium uncovered Dishonored her head and we found out her head is her husband for even that is all one as if she were shaving now we're talking about hair so now wait a minute in verse 1 Paul says follow me I'm your leader and then as I follow Christ he's my head he's my leader now verse 3 we find out the head of the woman is the man and then verse 5 he's something he's talking about hair so now wait a minute now somebody just what in the world his hair got to do with headship how many would like to know the answer amen well I'm going to do it I'm going to we only got about four or five hands but that's not majority but we're going to do it anyway uh you you'll enjoy it's very very good very good let's pray Lord Jesus thank you for the reading of the word thank you Lord for the the letter that Paul wrote to the Corinthians thank you for the correction and Lord most of all thank you for the understanding thank you that you sent your message during this day that we might have understanding and his brother Sean is doing such a good job on the services of prayer uh pray with understanding and then last week praying in truth it must be revealed truth we're thankful for those things and Lord I pray that you would speak to our hearts we've already invited your presence and help us Lord that we might understand a little deeper into this subject and why we ask your help Lord in the name of Jesus Christ and everybody says amen now I want to talk about you could be seated we want to talk about understanding headship and I like to give it kind of a that's kind of the general thought that we want to go but I want to be more specific and talk about understanding the Veil so I'm just going to go jump right into the middle okay uh Marco I want to go to Genesis 2 right now Genesis 2 18 a couple of scriptures in Genesis Genesis 2 18 let's look at the order of headship between husband and wife now one thing if let me just kind of preface this if you ask uh obviously we're going to talk about why a woman shouldn't cut her hair I know that you none of you do that and hopefully none of you ever trim it but here's the thing I want you to understand why if I ask a denominational person of course first of all they don't even believe it's wrong to cut their hair but if they did believe it why it's it's you it's you should not cut your hair she said well the Bible says so that's true but why you know there's got to be a reason why you know and it's so we want and another thing even for our sisters uh to teach your children teach if you've got daughters teacher or daughters you know why you know you should have long hair and this will really help all of us and this also has to do with headship uh Genesis 2 18 and the Lord God said it is not good that man should be alone I will make a help meet for him now first notice it's not recorded that Adam ever complained about being alone uh because you know Adam had God but it's interesting what brother Brown said about this statement but God said it's not good so God certainly had a reason to make a help meet for Adam and brother Brown says now and question answers he said now there went the male and female in the cow and there went the horse and there went the ox and there went everything in pairs see there was but there was something lacking that crave showed that there was a mate waiting for him you get it and the Very thoughts that we have to die here that we're troubled and perplexed here we long for a life that has no death it shows we're waiting for so there's a thirst there's a craving there and he said and Adam was lonesome and God to show that they could not be separated to show that they cannot be separated after he made Eve now I'm going to go back and do the same thing just a second look he never went and got dirt and made Eve notice where Eve came from but he made from the original dirt Adam a rib which you know understand he took a rib from his side and made him a help me and that was Eve she was made for the man and part of the man she was part of him in the beginning in the creation in the theophany she was part of him down here in this creation she could not be divided in any other creations she had to be made of the same creation talking about the original dirt atoms made from what he was created from and brother I said that's exactly why Christ and God had to be the very same person it could not be anything different couldn't be divided Christ and God are one now and let's look at verse 20 Genesis 2 and 20. and Adam gave names to the cattle into the fowl of the air and to every beast of the field but for Adam there was not a help me for him now in verse 17 God tells Adam not to eat of the tree of the knowledge of Good and Evil and that was before Eve was was actually formed but it's not recorded that Adam actually that God told Eve not that but you know whether he told him or Adam I actually relayed the message doesn't matter she knew that she was not to partake of that tree that fruit now in verse 20 but for Adam there was not found to help me for him now what is a help me we call it a help mate the Bible calls it'll help me what is a help me it's interesting what the definition helped me is what what a real help me is help me it means don't miss it help me means a helper suitable for him a counterpart of himself a helper cards corresponding to him now I'm going to go through the thing if y'all want to you know take notes that's fine with me a helper correspond to him now a helper corresponding a helper corresponding now that term is not a demeaning term remember now before the fall before the fall and this is really interesting because before the fall Eve was co-equal with Adam before the fall they had this they had the same nature now remember only the flesh was a byproduct from Adam her spirit came from Adam uh Adam had both the Mastin and a feminist Spirit uh that before Eve was ever formed so her spirit came from from Adam because he had both those spirits but her flesh of course was the byproduct so here we have a very interesting observation before the fall there was no need for headship because they were both equal right right that's true right she was co-equaled with Adam but now after the fall that changed everything changed everything now in verse 23 and Genesis 2 23 and Adam said this is now remember God had put Adam to a deep sleep took a rib from his side closed up the gash and he wakes up now and Adam said this is now bone of my bone flesh in my flesh she shall be called woman because she was taken out of man God obviously had to give him a revelation because he was in a deep sleep when this surgery took place but he says now she's boning my bones because now as we said Adam took one of God took one of them Adam's Rib which is bone now he's bone rebound flesh of his flesh she should be called woman because she was taken out of man now she shall be called woman what does the word woman mean very interesting I had a brother I had a brother one time said I can tell you how you spell woman now we spell it w-o-m-a-n but he said because he didn't have a very good marriage but he said the way I spell won't but w-o-e-m-a-n woman but what does what does the woman mean actually woman means the word the root word of because well man the root word is man so that's a clue right there Whoa man woman the Hebrew word is m-a-n-n-i-n which is rendered a female man remember his Spirit came from Adam he had both Baptist and feminists took a rib made a byproduct form flesh so actually in short term actually a woman actually they say the word woman actually is short for the word womb man w-o-m-b womb man she carries the so she can have receive seed and have a child so that's where that come from now of course in Genesis 3 Genesis 3 Here Comes Satan in the picture and of course he defiles everything and we know Satan uses a serpent to communicate with he with Eve now in Genesis 3 2 and I'm I'm just hurting along so we don't want to take a lot of time Genesis 3 2 now and the woman said it to the serpent now here's the serpent speaking uh the woman speaking back to the serpent the woman said to the serpent we may eat of the fruit of the Trees of the garden now Eve knew not to partake of it we may eat at the fruit of the Trees of the garden verse 3 but the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden God has said ye shall not eat of it neither shall you touch it lest ye die and the serpent said unto woman ye shall not surely die but she did die so first of all we know that was a lie to begin with that was Lie number one it's very very interesting and then for in verse Genesis 3 and 5. for God does not now suffer speaking here now again in serpent as a woman you should not surely die for God does know that in the day that ye thereof then your eyes shall be open and ye shall be as Gods knowing Good and Evil now according to brother random that's lie number two I'm going to read you the quote I didn't know this until just a few months back now if you read Genesis 3 22 this is where the serpent got that from remember he always tries to quote the scripture but he'll take the scripture and he'll misplace it misconstrue it or misapply it Genesis 3 22 and the Lord God said behold the man the behold the man has become one of us to know good and evil and now lest he put forth his hand and take also of the tree of life and eat and live forever live forever now listen what brother Madam says about this scripture brother man said in Revelations chapter 4 said let's turn to Genesis 3 24 just for a minute Genesis the third chapter 24 verse you love it Congress amen now let's begin about 22nd verse uh this is something I just want to put in here just a little extra but it may do a whole lot it may do a whole lot of good someday yeah I believe it did now this is what brother remember says and the Lord said and the Lord said behold the man has become one of us and he stops now my loving and precious darling sisters let me place it like that do not think that I am throwing a reflect upon the loyalty and the gracious precious Jewel of Womanhood I'm trying to show here that a woman dot dot dot please and you on tape you women are listening to this tape I'm not trying to scorn you I'm only a servant of the Lord to bring light he and of course he talks about this in marriage and divorce the lowest in the lowest and most immoralist and most filthy thing on earth is a woman when she is bad and the most precious Jewel that there is to a man besides his salvation is a good woman right and I'm speaking to that he's talking about speaking of that low immoral degraded now I'm going to show you right here while we're at it just might as well show you why that I the Bible teaches for a woman not to be preachers pastors teachers or anything else in the church now listen to this then he goes back to that scripture and the Lord said behold the man has become one of us and brother man says now he never said that the woman has become one of us the man has become one of us and knows good and evil the man says she the woman didn't she was deceived do you see it she was deceived so Satan is telling her you're going to know good and evil and you're and you're going to be as God you're going to know the difference so far but that was a lie because God already knew that the woman was going to be deceived because he made her thus he made her that she could be deceived like Paul talks about the for Adam was first conceived you know and I forget how the scripture goes but Adam was not in the transgression but Eve being deceived was in the transgression she was the one that's being deceived she didn't think she was wrong but she was actually deceived and so she and Paul said I suffer not a woman to teach or a serpent Authority that's continued on the same quote but for Adam was first form and Eve and Adam was not deceived but the woman was deceived so she didn't become one of God she didn't know no different she was deceived do you get it I guess she says amen and the Lord said behold the man has become one of us to know good and evil and to know and now lest he put forth his hand and take also of the tree of life and live forever it's really interesting you take that scripture I don't have the quote in front of me but brother man just said the same thing if you take that that scripture said that and Earth is groaning waiting for the manifestations of the sons of God brother man said the same thing so you notice he never said about the women it's all it's always about the sons of God because see laodicea and laodice said everything in laodicea is backwards and perverted backwards and perverted I mean anything that I that I am going to say today none of laodicea believes it they don't want it they would hear it they'd throw me out on my ear because they don't because this is people's rights women's rights laodicea Satan's Eden Satan's Paradise they don't want anything to do with the rightful divided word we understand that that's it's so sad but it's still the truth see so you can't teach this like I said to the Pentecostal Church you know uh because people's rights and women's rights and women's equality and actually today it's it's women's superiority uh uh you you could thank God we don't have television but even for last 20 25 years uh I have heard and I heard saw a lot of years ago we had every commercial the man's a dummy and the woman's the smart one it's all the way through I mean it's just all the way through in the last 15 20 30 years it's just got worse and worse I don't care what they're advertising the woman's the smart one the man's a dummy it's all for a purpose because this is Satan's Paradise Satan's eaten this is Satan's kingdom and God's going to have a perfect bride out of Satan's Paradise A Perfect Bride she don't this Perfect Bride doesn't doesn't believe the lies of Satan none of it so in God's Eden Eve was co-equal with Adam then after the fall she lost her co-equanus so here is a here's the result in Genesis 3 16 here's the result unto the woman he said I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception and saw Thou shalt bring four children and their desire and thy desire shall be to thy husband and he shall rule over thee I didn't write it I'm just reading it now see what Eve did she throws the whole world into death she so she Eve she lost her co-equiveness and in Genesis 3 16 is where the headship began for the woman she she didn't need headship before the fall so now ever since the fall God required headship for both men and women now I want to kind of deviate just a little bit and I want to talk just a little bit about false history false headship just for uh just for a couple of minutes to show why God had said Malachi 4. and even after the fall God remained ahead over all things at least that's what was God is was intent one his desire but mankind of course failed and always they just failed and failed miserably and and because they couldn't fully obey that you see now and Satan Satan because of the fall and he was able to interject death into the human race Satan wanted to be the head over the world the Nations and all so we find Satan desire in Isaiah 14. we won't read it but you read that he said I will I'll be exalted above the stars of heaven and I'll be like the most high and I will I will I will so Satan had his headship all the way down from the beginning until finally for finally in this day in this day Isaiah 14 is fully matured manifested and accomplished eyes uh Satan it become the god of this world this is his paradise his kingdom his world he has the Nations he has everything amen Satan is a God of this evil age but he comes on down his his headship came down with Nimrod because that was Satan's headship at one time that made everybody pay tribute to head to uh Nimrod and then it came down to pergamus Satan's seat for a while and then Babylon and comes on down to the Pharisees and then the Catholic church and made the Catholic Church of Pope over all of it which still is the headship of all denominations of Catholic church and Through the Dark Ages they killed 68 million Christians during that time and as I said the Catholic church is still the head over every Church denominational system Independence all of them and finally down to the end Satan will be the head his has become the headship of all Nations but now it's not babbling like it was in the beginning but now it's mystery Babylon Revelation 17 not just Babylon but his headship now is Mystery babbling of course sits on Seven Hills room and we know that Catholic Church now and how many worships Satan this is one good reason that we so thankful for Malachi for how many are worshiping Satan so well I don't know anybody where to say worship Satan really brother man said Thank you in the worst been god brother man said and God of this evil age now listen for Satan is not spoke of as a god of any other age but this age he wasn't spoke of the god of the age of Noah he wasn't spoke of the god of the age of Moses the god of the age of Elijah but this evil age oh don't miss it he is a God of this evil age worshiped by millions and billions of people and they don't know it [Music] that is so so sad what was the rebuke to laodicea wretched miserable blind and don't even know it worshiped by millions and billions of people they don't know it but their worshiping him through a Creed a man-made denomination increase that's brought the people right down to the greatest deception the world has ever known of thank God he sent Malachi 4. amen that's why in this last evil age God had to send Malachi for he had to send Malachi he said if I don't I'll even Smite the Earth with a curse if it had become so corrupt in the mind of God he had to send Malachi 4 to straighten this mess out and get a people ready for the Rapture there had to be something come and bring us out of the of the filthiness of spiritual wickedness in high places and denominations to get a bride ready for a rapture I mean thank God he sent us a prophet Messenger to forerun the coming headship that's why Revelations 10 1 Christ The Covenant Angel he has come down he is here he is our head he is our headship as even in 1933 on the Ohio River that was that famous quote as John the Baptist will sit the forerun the first coming of the Lord you'll have a message that will forerun the first the second coming of the Lord there had to be a forerunner to forerun the coming word we're thankful that he sent us a message or the forerun the coming word and we realize that first Thessalonians 4 16 to shout the voice and the trumpet so forth you know and uh our ship our headship is there and I had a whole another whole message on that brother man talks about and I had you listen to Christ the mystery you know the headship in the body has become one unit and all about that that's that's not something to be taken lightly that is actually a uh a paradox because it's not even true in the denomination because their headship is not the word to reveal word present day truth but it is for the bride now I had a I had a a DVD I wanted to show you a clip was only about five minutes but the new computer doesn't have a a DVD uh a tray in it so I can't I can't play that but what it actually it really what it actually showed was and actually taught was probably the best expose that I've ever heard of what is real salvation I mean true salvation your dedication to the Lord your your he is he is the control of your life everything you do you say you you think your passions uh uh it's it's not so much that Christ died to uh crucified you know to keep us uh out of hell but that God could that that God could come out of heaven and be actually put into mankind what God always desired from the beginning God above us God With Us now God innocent God wanted to indwell in human beings and finally after six thousand years he's finally has accomplished that with the headship and the body has become one unit never has been that way in the fullness like we see it today never has they had partial word in Luther partial Wesley partial Pentecost but never the the full word born into manifestation where the Prophet God could say she's bone on my bone flesh of the flesh Life Is Life pirate fire she is him absolutely she is him and her headship is Christ all together that's why in the token message a Monumental statement brother man says full obedience to every word of God what entitles you to the Token what is a token the token is a literal life of Jesus Christ that life his life is now manifested in you amen now listen only and only in this age could a prophet give the answer to the devil's question and we have the answer to the devil's question now I brought I want to bring all that out in this other sermon what is the answer to the devil's question the headship is here the head Christ the headship Christ our head and the body has become one unit just beautiful amen not only is is he here he is the headship of the body and has become one unit as I said I just want to read this quote out of classroom Ministry and then we'll go on to more specific brother man says now now notice the anointed man the Christ himself here oh God is made known but now look but now why he has the preeminists god fully manifested in Jesus Christ God's Great secret of his Revelation now the threefold purpose you know to reveal God have Primitives in his bride and restore the kingdom never was as I said before it never was ever that God had complete preeminence in his bride they had part word even from Pentecost as much as they knew but they didn't have the full word only in his age beautiful he said but God's Great secret see this God had him back part of his mind this great secret that he never even revealed until the prophet of this age come Christ is the mystery of God revealed as I told you before every time you read mystery in the Bible the word at the original Greek it's word secret Christ is the secret of God revealed it's always secret King James just says mystery but it means the same thing but Christ is the secret of God revealed the devil don't even know that now when I read this quote I thought thank you Lord thank you Lord that great light of Revelation is always blinded the wisdom of the world in the days of Jesus Christ when he was here on Earth they had blinded them too said why you even make yourself God you make yourself equal with God he was not only equal with God he was God himself see and they don't get it God don't tell his secrets to the devil listen but he goes on to say in this short quote God's Great secret has always blinded the wisdom of the world they can't get it they just don't understand and he says and Satan don't understand it either if Satan understood that Jesus Christ was a messiah why would Satan kill Jesus Christ to redeem all mankind he said you may you're a man making yourself God he didn't believe that Jesus was God he didn't believe he was a messiah he didn't believe he's a redeemer Satan he did not understand that at Calvary had he understood he would have never he'd had Band-Aids all over him no no he didn't understand Satan did not understand that the prophet God said that Satan don't even understand and he don't understand it yet today that Christ and his bride can have complete Unity together he don't understand that today none of the rest of them I understand none of the rest of them understands it but just those who are predestinated to understand it how that God and Christ are one and how the Christ and the bride are one oh praise the Lord now I'm going to read let's get into First Corinthians 11 and I wanted some time to do that but I'm not going to do it today but I'm just going to cover some really really interesting background of why Paul wrote the letter of First Corinthians and he brought in about women cutting their hair and you're going to see some very interesting wonderful things but I'm going to read Verses 4 through 16 out of the emphatic dialogue I got in front of me you don't have but you can follow if you will follow in your Bibles it's almost word for word but in the dialogue now let me just say about the dialogue the dog lot is not a version like the King James version We believe I have a king we all go by the King James we believe it it's it's perfect but there are certain words in there that are not rendered exactly in the Greek but the dog law is exactly the Greek word by word just just print it out just like the Apostle spoke it just like Jesus said and actually the dialogue is is actually clearer so that's the reason and brother man said brother man said ever clergyman ought to have a copy of the dialogue and read out of the diaglock called the emphatic diaglock let's read in verse four starting four and I'm just going to read this quickly I'd like to I could take each one of these verses and break it down it's a beautiful beautiful understanding of headship but we'll just touch on a couple of things in a minute verse 4 11 4 every man praying or prophesying having his head covered disgraces his head now it's just a little bit different word exact same meaning verse five but every woman praying or prophesying with her head uncovered disgraces her head for it is just the same as if it were shaven verse 6 for if a woman be unveiled let her hair also be cut off or shaven now I mean that's crystal clear I mean any denominational person could read in diaglock could see right there for if a woman be unveiled let her hair also be cut off or shaven but if it be disgraceful to a woman to have her hair cut off or to be shaven let her be veiled that's pretty clear to me if you go if you go in back to Deuteronomy a place in the Old Testament we're actually the uh the the law under the Jewish law about the uh a woman who thinks he's who actually her husband thinks he has cheated dishonorable like that if she's found to be like that they actually shave her head and it's a disgrace to her and she's a public you know prostitute and so forth like that so it actually has a Jewish background that's why he refers back to it you know just if you're gonna cut it at all then just shave it off be slick because that's a disgrace to a woman to have her head being shaved that's the reason he put that in there verse seven now amen indeed ought not to cover the head he being God's glorious likeness but the woman is man's Glory see the difference man's head is is Christ the woman's head is a man for a man is not from woman but woman from man for man also was not created for the woman but woman for the man you can't tell that to laodicea I mean brother man talks about obey they took that out of the scripture and a woman obeyed today no she obeys him that's what the prophet of God said but the woman was made for the man Eve was made for Adam Adam was not made for evil is made for Adam and he says therefore because and he said now the woman was made for the man therefore or as a result of the woman ought to have Authority or power on the head on account of the angels and brothers said well as far as the Angels their messenger said every Prophet God would just blast out about women cutting her hair a lot in that but we we won't take time for that however neither is a woman without the man or The Man Without The Woman in the work in the Lord for as the woman is from the man so also the man is by the woman but all things are from God we're going to touch on that in just a minute judge yourselves it is is it becoming for a woman to pray to God unveiled we know what unveiled is he's removed recovery to remove your covering you cut your hair so is it a is it becoming for a woman to pray to God with cut hair unveiled does not even nature herself teach you that if a man indeed should have wear long hair it is a disgrace to him but if a woman should wear long hair it is a glory to her because now here's the most interesting part of this whole verse you've got to understand how it's actually house verse 15 actually written into King James uh but if a woman have long hair it's a glory to her for her hair is given her for a covering and the dialogue it says verse 15 but if a woman should wear long hair it is a glory to her because her hair has been given to her instead of a veil her hair is given to her instead of a veil now that's why my sub topic subject is understanding the Veil let's learn a little bit about why Paul wrote this to the Corinthians now Paul wrote 14 books of the Bible we know that in his letter he wrote to the ones to Colossians thessalonica and Ephesus and so forth there were letters for edification encouragement and correction and to straighten out a lot of false teaching like for example in first Thessalonians the first Thessalonians Paul writes about the day of the Lord and so what happened was they come into a lot of judaizers and false teachers and they began to propagate the idea that the day of the Lord that uh you know the day of the Lord is upon us right now and so what happened was that uh seeds of false Doctrine come in and many overreacted by they gave up their job they became idle they began to live off of others and assuming that the the coming of the Lord is so imminent and they just become Idol and then that got them into other problems because they misinterpreted the scripture then Paul comes around about several months later and and and and writes a letter in second Thessalonians and he's and he straightens out that false Doctrine and said before they come to the Lord there's got to be a falling away first and he explains the man of sin has got to come on the scene before there's a falling it's got to be a fallen away before the the coming of the Lord so he has to straighten out that issue that cropped up in the church at thessalonica same thing with the in the Corinthian Church there was the issue there were some issues in that church you think we got issues in the church today you say well there's early church they didn't have no problem they had problems they had problems and one of the reasons they had problems because they were Gentile most of them were Gentile converts in colossae and thessful knocking these places like that they were not Jews they were Gentile Converse they know nothing about the Jewish law very little about the Jewish law so to tell that you know you've got to do this don't do that or whatever they they didn't understand that I mean they all they knew was idolatry and fornication and illicit sex and and you name it they had they had brothels and all kinds of stuff in idolatry worship so Paul had to straighten this issue out if he needed if he strained it out then he really needs to straighten it out today doesn't he so he he did now you must understand the early church they had some serious problem now the church at Corinth it had some problems too like for example in First Corinthians First Corinthians 5 1 just reading the Scripture it is reported commonly that there is fornication among you and such fornication has not so much as named among the Gentiles that one should have his father's wife now Paul said look it's reported that this thing is this is taking place in the Corinthian Church so he had to address that they had some problems for most Christians they were Gentile like I said that they knew very little about the law of Moses and Paul in the Crimson church he had to feed them a lot on milk a lot of Correction so now the church at Corinth it had another issue and this is the issue that's kind of plagued all the way down and this is a good example of mislo or misinterpreting a scripture uh Paul needed to straighten out the headship issue there and this has ship issues were called about a scripture they were going to read and this scripture is Galatians 3 26 27 28 I want you to bring that up Galatians 3 26 27 28. and this actually was the scripture that calls most of the confusion back at that early church and still today Galatians 3 26 for you all for all of the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus 27 for as many as of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ here it is verse 28 there is neither Jew nor Greek there is neither Bond of free there is neither male nor female for you are all one in Christ Jesus is that the scripture how do you rightly divide that scripture listen it see it seemed some seem to think a couple of things that brother Brahm calls confusion saying he says now this this scripture here along with Paul's teaching about headship one that the man is the head of the woman that caused a lot of confusion in the early Corinthian Church now one place Paul said the head of the woman is a man and another place he says there's no there's neither male nor female in Christ so what the result was the women began to claim that they could do just what the men could do this early Corinthian Church the women between begin to think that they could do what the men could do because Paul said this neither male nor female in Christ Jesus they could preach they could teach they could appear in public unveiled women begin to pray women actually begin to pray in the public which was unveiled which was absolute disgrace for a woman to be in public unveiled actually cloth Veil over a head I think the Arabs still you know they steal the burqa whatever it is they still bail themselves which was an insult to both the Jews and the Gentiles for a woman to pray in public unveiled it was a universal custom for women to always appear in public with their head covered or her veil her veil was her veil was a token sign of in public of her loyalty to her husband as her headship it was a sign that was her token sign in public if she was out in public she she must wear that Bell showing that her loyalty is to her husband and she was not a public woman if she took the veil off in public she was considered to be a public person and not a loyal wife at home privately actually the absence of the veil was a stamp of harlotry actually it was a stamp when she wore when she was unveiled took the veil off in public it was a stamp of harlotry pretty serious isn't it very serious it was the man's place to serve in public it was a wife's place to serve at home now along with that scripture uh we know he whom the son of man has made free is free indeed it also it gave the women a license for women to begin to think they could do whatever men could do I mean we could we could preach a message on freedom you know when he whom the son of man is set free is free indeed listen freedom and I'm not going to preach on this Freedom will finally Destroy This Nation freedom because if you don't have controlled people that's got at least some common sense and some Authority for for the authority and some understanding of headship right and wrong and so forth Freedom will just take you Plumb down to the gutter which is on that way down and besides that what was the you remember what the three sins I think there's five sins of Sodom but there's three of the five three three is at least the three sins of Sodom is certainly in America in full force today Pride fullness of bread idle time sends us autumn that's right idle time fullness of bread Pride hello America history tells us that it seems that the Corinthian slogan was everything is permissible for the women and the Corinthian women expressed that principle by throwing off their Veil also they seem to reject the concept of subordination the husband being their head uh subordination according to Paul for a woman to throw off her veil was a was degrading to her as she might as well shave her head which was a sign of disgrace if you're going to take your Veil off just shave your head slick which was disgraceful in the Old Testament according to Jewish law anyway so hold on everybody I got a purpose for all this now remember a misinterpreted scripture neither male or female calls this confusion now I'm going to read you a short paragraph taken from history and this is what kind of a overview of what it was back then in the Corinthian Church and I quote here it began to Dawn on women that she was neither man's toy nor slave but that she had a life to frame for herself she was not dependent upon man for her Christian privileges ought she not to show this by laying inside the veil which was an acknowledged Badge of dependence so she said well sure you know since there's neither male or female I mean I could just throw off my veil I can be like man I can do what the man can do and we can preach we can do this we can do that not so according to the scripture we understand that now First Corinthians 11 15 but if a woman have long hair is the glory to her for her hair here's a here's the whole Crux of the whole thing her covering her veil they had to have a cloth Veil back then they had to wear a veil in public anytime that they went out in the public the woman must be veiled otherwise she was tagged but now Paul in the New Testament and under grace not under the law under grace it says it's a glory to her for her hair is given to her for a covering her hair has been given to her instead of a veil so God now has declared now you women you don't have to wear a cloth Veil anymore your hair is your Veil that's your Veil and that's why the prophet God told us when she cuts her hair she takes her veil off she disgraces her head which the husband she's she is the glory of the husband she disgraces her husband that's why I brought them and we'll get to that in just a minute how many times how many times did brother Ben talk about Bob's hair cut hair women won't let your hair grow long cut your hair off whatever all this almost 400 times brother man talks about that how important that was not just because well they shorten the hair it's a sign it says it's it's a it's a symbol it's a meaning behind it God declared that that be a sign and she hold true to that sign as I said reading from the Greek but if a woman should wear long hair it is a glory to her because her hair has been given to her instead of the Veil her hair is given instead of a veil now we have a little better understanding of why the prophet hammered so much against women with bobbed hair or cut hair short hair cut their hair off or any other phrase like I said almost 400 times I mean why it's it's it's not to be hard on women but but it's to save them from a disgraceful life in a disgraceful destiny so this it's it's God appointed declaration now let me show you something here you say well it's it's it's not the it's not the physical hair follicle that is is a sin but it's the that he could which you can't do it not for me to do it but it's it's a sign look let me show you something in the Old Testament God had a covenant with Israel and that Covenant with circumcision now the physical circumcision was not the Covenant itself but it was a sign of the Covenant it was required but the circumcision was a sign of the Covenant God made a covenant with the Jewish people with the Jews of Israel and that was circumcision but that was the actual uh physical thing was a sign of that Covenant that God made with Israel just like water baptism I mean does water save a person water don't save you but you but now the Church of Christ believed that it does because I I was researching right because the Bible says even does water now save you not to put away the filth of the flesh but the answer of a good conscience called God but we have water baptism what is water baptism water baptism is a requirement but it's a sign it's it's an outward sign of an inward work that's what but you must be baptized now we know the thief on the cross he didn't have opportunity to be baptized he was saved also but is it is an outward sign of an inward work I mean you could talk about a wedding band you could talk about a lot of things that are actually signed for the minutes of the woman should wear a wedding band to show that she is married you know and then we you know they exchange wedding bands you know they come but the Covenant brother man said marriage divorce when the man asked the woman then that their their in God's eye they're legally married right there so to speak you know because they made that Covenant they made the agreement but the wedding band is a sign of it and it's the same thing with the veil her hair has been given to her instead of a covering but it's a sign that she's under subjection and headship of her husband now you tell that to a layout sin woman wife and I was talking about this the other day if you take just and brother Graham said in in future home he said I can guarantee you one thing there will be no bobbed-haired women in that City quote unquote now if you just now we know the Rapture is the brightest for the bride they go to the wedding supper they're in the Millennium with Christ you know we don't have to go the white Throne we live in the new city the other people live on the outside of the city but let me ask you if if in laodicea today if cutting your hair was the was just the only criteria that keep a woman out of the Rapture how many women in La Odyssey would go how many you know as well as the very very very few then if you take the Deuteronomy 22 4 woman putting on a garment pertaining to a man if you had if that was the only criteria how many it would go into Rapture very very very few that's why that's why I read that that quote at the very beginning where brother Memphis said God's intention for his people in any age it's never been in any age God's intention for his people to act like the people of the world never she's always been a separate people look different act different talk different dress different everything's different their action their ways that men are living everything their appetizers thing and all that they're making everything in this world is contrary that's why she is to be different oh my and now the veil I said the veil is not the headship it is a sign and a public Declaration of her loyal to her headship which are which is her husband and the Bible says in the New Testament that God declared a woman's hair to be instead of the veil that's why her hair is her veil and that's why if she cuts her hair at all she's removing that Veil scissors are not for women period at all none zero and train up your children I mean people I listen I I you know they asked brother Ben a question about you know trimming uh Rebeccas and Sarah's hair and stuff like that I said well I you know I can't say maybe if she's four or five years old you know be okay to trim her bangs or whatever like that he said I know you talk the Bible's talking about women but the Bible does say train up your children the way they should go so we just leave that there so there you are there you are that's the reamer Theresa com women are commanded not to cut their hair trim it burn it or do anything to the length of the hair leave it alone that's your that's not only is your glory that is your Covenant that you are submissive to your husband your head that's why brother man said it's just a common common thing for a woman if she cuts her hair even to pray and in fact in fact they can't receive this God I mean if a woman's got cut here God will hear a prayer of repentance he will hear a prayer to repentance but just just a general prayer that's why brother man said that so many times just a common old thing for a woman to pray with her haircut because God don't hear a prayer I mean uh he said but it's just that's just the way it is I mean it's a that's that that's why this bride is different she's not like the world just all together now I got here a beautiful little quote just for you sisters just for you sisters and I'm actually I'm finished I'm closing and Al said don't you never say you're closing unless you're closing but I told you I was just going to get right to the point leave it just to tell you why just a video okay now listen sisters I know I know that Satan has been said marriage divorce you know that uh he has chose the woman and he's her designer and and uh the beauty of women in the last days and on and on and on and boy he targets the women I mean she is the Bull's Eye she is targeted in this day we know that but I found this and I held on to it and I want you you sisters you can rejoice in this okay I shall read she was not in the original creation all other females in the original creation bird male and female animals male and female but in human life God only made a man and he took from him and a woman is a byproduct of a man because God did not Institute such a thing search the scriptures exactly right God no sir in his original creation she was put out there but you want me to read the rest of it now would you would you save it for next time I preach no you want me to read it how many more wants me to read it it's not human unanimous how many wants me to read it everybody okay all right sister no sir in his original creation but she was put out there but this is choosing of a bride 1965. but if she can hold herself right what a greater reward she has than the man wow yeah well Hallelujah it's amazing I didn't write it I just read it I shall read it again but if she can hold herself right you're targeted God knows you're targeting this day if she can hold herself right what a greater reward she has than man she's put on a testing ground through her come death she's guilty of all death but then God turned right around and used one thing to bring life back again brought his son through the woman and obedient one musicians would you call but if she can hold herself right what a greater reward she has than man to me that was worth the whole sermon praise the Lord amen I told you I wasn't going to hold you long today but I was going to get right to the point I said I know you sister don't cut your hair teach your children why why teach them why especially you got daughters why it's not just the way the Bible said don't cut it but why it's a sign of your subjection and headship to your husband uh let me just read that it was just a little footnote and I wanted to read out here out of the indigo which I've already said it but it's just real short it said the word uh Ray did which they're talking about she shall have power over head is the word raid Edge signifies a veil the Apostle used the word excrucia authority to none of it to denote Avail because the Hebrew women Veil themselves in presence of men in token of their being under their power or authority their subjection to their head their husband s aren't you aren't you so glad that God restored proper headship in this day I mean for the for for the husbands I mean our headship is Christ I mean we we have we're we're targeted but the women are targeted because he never said like you know the Bible does talk about it if a man look on a woman to lust ever you know it's a he's already committed adultery with her he never said that about a woman because it's it's just it's it's not a necessarily a reversible thing which we have bad women that lust and so people like that but because the woman she she has that vessel she is that vessel and so it's just it's just the way the creation went so she's got to hold herself she's got her dress right she can't expose herself she can't give any indication she's she's not even supposed to be to be flirty and all these things like that she's supposed to hold herself right [Music] because she's not a public woman she's a private woman she gives herself and brother man said very simply women you serve God by serving your husband it's very simple you serve God by serving your husband amen where is he at sing us a song brother [Music] thank you [Music] razor [Music] sister [Music] foreign [Applause] [Music] foreign [Music]
