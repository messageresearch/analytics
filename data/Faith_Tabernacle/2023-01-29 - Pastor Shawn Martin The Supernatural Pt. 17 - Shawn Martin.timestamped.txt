[42:30] the book of Ephesians the first chapter
[42:34] amen and we're going to read the 22nd
[42:39] and 23rd verses
[42:44] just so thankful that we could all come
[42:47] together today
[42:48] a man and
[42:51] it's amazing just how the devil will try
[42:54] to put everything in our way just to
[42:56] hinder us from coming to the house of
[42:58] God
[42:59] and we're glad that we persevered and
[43:04] and come anyways just just to glorify
[43:09] his name
[43:11] amen you know brother Brown talked about
[43:14] that you know I think it was in adoption
[43:16] of how that uh you know the tutor
[43:20] talking to the father
[43:21] and uh you know says I I put everything
[43:24] in his way you know and yet he would
[43:27] come to he'd come to church anyways come
[43:29] to the house of God and and uh you know
[43:32] and he just bragging about the sons of
[43:34] God and and I think God is bragging on
[43:37] us today amen and uh you know we
[43:41] shouldn't be here by any means and
[43:45] um I think it's a paradox when you get a
[43:47] people that are mortal that have trials
[43:50] and tribulations and still can praise
[43:52] God
[43:53] that's a paradox amen but you know what
[43:57] I think that's just a Wonder amen we
[44:01] could have every excuse not to come we
[44:04] could have every excuse not to you know
[44:06] uh in
[44:08] naturally speaking to even serve the
[44:10] Lord look how many people have all their
[44:12] excuses of why they don't serve God and
[44:16] they don't see any benefits whatsoever
[44:18] but here we are we see all the benefits
[44:20] even through all the trials you know we
[44:23] see the benefits and I say the the
[44:25] benefits outweigh uh far outweigh the
[44:28] trials that we go through amen but the
[44:32] book of Ephesians 1 and 22 it says and
[44:37] hath put all things under his feet and
[44:39] gave him to be the head over all things
[44:41] to the church
[44:43] which is his body the fullness of him
[44:47] that filleth all in all amen let's just
[44:52] bow our heads
[44:53] talk to our Lord father
[44:56] it is a good day to serve you that good
[45:00] day to come to your house
[45:02] Lord just to offer thanks and if we
[45:06] would just go around and given the
[45:07] testimony
[45:09] of what you've done for us Lord this
[45:12] week we could stay here for hours Lord
[45:15] you've been so good and yet there's
[45:17] there's many things that you've done
[45:19] that we we aren't even aware of it's
[45:22] escaped or noticed but lord it's because
[45:26] you were with us that we can praise you
[45:29] and glorify you today
[45:32] and Lord I know that you've desired to
[45:35] meet with this father and we pray that
[45:38] you would just have your way Lord and
[45:41] let everything that is said and done be
[45:43] pleasing to you father take complete
[45:46] control
[45:47] of this service of my body Lord of Let
[45:52] It Be you that speak through these
[45:54] mortal lips may it be you that believe
[45:57] Lord through your people father and oh
[46:01] let it be all you we ask it Lord in
[46:04] Jesus Christ's name we pray and the
[46:07] church says
[46:09] amen amen you can have your seats this
[46:13] morning
[46:14] and um
[46:16] you know I I certainly think it uh
[46:20] amazing
[46:21] that God would choose or what God would
[46:26] choose to make his church with
[46:28] and uh we know it's a supernatural
[46:32] Church
[46:33] it's a powerful Church
[46:36] but yet the the the what he made uh his
[46:42] church with is incredible
[46:44] unlearned men and women and and
[46:48] men and women that are full of faults
[46:52] and failures and you know when he
[46:54] started the church there in Pentecost
[46:56] there were people that didn't even know
[46:58] how to write their name
[47:00] uh ignored and unlearned and and they
[47:04] weren't much to look at and and and in
[47:07] this day is the same same way we're just
[47:11] the average person
[47:13] uh naturally speaking and these things
[47:16] but when it when it comes to the value
[47:20] uh that that God sees in us it's we are
[47:25] invaluable
[47:28] um the world may not see value uh but
[47:31] God sees value and I'm so glad for that
[47:35] if if he didn't see value in you he
[47:37] wouldn't have chose you a man but God
[47:39] saw the value and and he would call men
[47:44] and women to be his church to be his
[47:47] body a man and many times that becomes
[47:51] that's a paradox in itself and because
[47:55] here we are flesh and blood and and uh
[47:59] uh human and and full of faults and
[48:03] failures and subject to all kinds of
[48:06] things but yet God chose us uh uh to to
[48:10] be his body and and and as he did as he
[48:15] started that church on the day of
[48:16] Pentecost it was a supernatural
[48:18] happening it and he it was a
[48:21] supernatural work in in their lives and
[48:25] God God made them his church God took
[48:29] these people that were ignorant and
[48:31] unlearned that that were not just really
[48:34] valuable to society and uh he he would
[48:39] take them people and make them his
[48:42] church by uh uh coming into them God
[48:47] came into them a man and uh you know the
[48:53] the as we've read you know where it was
[48:56] a tongue of fire that rested upon each
[48:59] and every one of them a man and the
[49:02] prophet said that was God dividing
[49:04] himself up amen and and and and and to
[49:09] live in inside of them which made them
[49:13] his body ain't that right his church and
[49:16] and God knew he was going to have a
[49:18] church that's exactly why he he he
[49:21] redeemed uh uh man and that's the whole
[49:24] point of the work of Calvary and he
[49:27] would even prophesy Upon This Rock I'll
[49:30] build my church and and it would be that
[49:33] church that the Gates of Hell will not
[49:35] Prevail against and and that rock is the
[49:38] Revelation that the church is built upon
[49:41] the revelation of Jesus Christ ain't
[49:44] that right it's it's it's about him not
[49:47] about us ain't that right it's about him
[49:50] God's church is about him and and not
[49:53] about us and that that's the Revelation
[49:55] is that we could see him and have a
[49:59] revelation of him amen and our own
[50:02] selves just diminish a man and and so we
[50:06] we find that it is a many-membered body
[50:09] and on that day he gave them a Heavenly
[50:13] language amen until they didn't know
[50:15] what they were saying as as the prophet
[50:18] said and and he gave them the abstract
[50:21] which showed that everything
[50:24] uh uh that that was against them had
[50:27] been taken away no everything was
[50:30] cleared off there was nothing against
[50:32] them and and and when God come into them
[50:36] it quickened their body it quickened
[50:38] their tongue it quickened their soul
[50:40] brother Branham said it quickened their
[50:43] bodies until they flew so close to
[50:45] Heaven till it quickened their body to
[50:48] speak in a language they never heard of
[50:50] before it quickened their bodies they
[50:52] spoke in a new Heavenly language they
[50:55] they were quickened into the presence of
[50:58] God by the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[51:01] God's quickening power baptized them
[51:05] into that they were in the place of
[51:08] worship then to where they could worship
[51:11] the Sanhedrin and nothing else could
[51:13] ever bother them because they were
[51:16] quickened and notice how he puts it they
[51:19] were a new people amen they were not the
[51:22] same uh Peter was different he wasn't
[51:25] the same Mary uh Mary wasn't the same
[51:29] and and and we're so thankful for that
[51:31] amen you you would think that that uh
[51:34] her having being impregnated uh and and
[51:39] and and bearing the Messiah that would
[51:42] have changed her forever amen but she
[51:45] needed a Pentecostal experience to make
[51:48] her a different person ain't that right
[51:50] amen and no matter what experience comes
[51:53] to you you need a Pentecostal experience
[51:57] to change you forever and and that's
[52:00] what God wanted ain't that right and
[52:03] they didn't need someone to teach them
[52:05] how to cope with life they they didn't
[52:08] need somebody to teach them how to cope
[52:10] with their failures and mistakes and but
[52:13] they were quick and the prophet said to
[52:15] a new way of life
[52:19] aren't you glad for that a new way of
[52:21] life we were one one's uh uh living at
[52:26] uh One Life by the birth of our natural
[52:28] parents but when the Holy Ghost came it
[52:32] quickened us to a new way of life amen
[52:35] and that's the body of Jesus Christ amen
[52:39] the old man the old nature the old
[52:42] desires have died to a man and and we're
[52:46] so glad uh uh second Peter 5 17 we know
[52:50] it but Paul says if any man be in Christ
[52:53] he is a new creature or a creation New
[52:57] Creation old things are passed away
[53:00] behold all things are become new I think
[53:04] you get a new thought when you get the
[53:06] Holy Ghost I I think you get a new life
[53:09] when you get the Holy Ghost new desires
[53:11] new way of of language new way of of
[53:15] acting new way of of everything about
[53:18] you become is different ain't that right
[53:20] yes sir no more conforming to the world
[53:24] that's what we desired we we desired to
[53:27] be like the world we desire to be
[53:29] popular with the world we desire to have
[53:31] friends of the world we we desire to be
[53:34] understood by the world but you know
[53:37] what when the life of God came into us
[53:39] all them desires are gone we don't care
[53:42] what the world thinks of us we don't
[53:44] care what what our friends our neighbors
[53:47] think of us we don't we don't care if
[53:49] we're a number 10 on their chart or
[53:52] number one on their chart it doesn't
[53:54] matter to us as long as God is pleased
[53:57] with us can you say Amen uh uh I'd
[54:01] rather have him living in my life
[54:03] working through me amen I'd rather if if
[54:06] they call us a puppet let them call us a
[54:08] puppet but as long as I'm I'm used of
[54:11] God that's all that matters amen but we
[54:13] know it's a prisoner of Jesus Christ
[54:16] ain't that right so this creation nation
[54:19] of his uh uh it's a creation of his
[54:23] broad body and this is what the
[54:26] Pentecostal experience means amen you
[54:29] cannot get an a Pentecostal experience
[54:32] by joining a Pentecostal denomination
[54:34] that's that's not where we seek to to be
[54:38] uh uh but it's a supernatural thing uh
[54:42] that that that causes the uh Pentecostal
[54:46] experience and and I say to you only the
[54:49] elect can receive that Pentecostal
[54:51] experience I just believe that I think
[54:54] all that was up there in that upper room
[54:55] was the elect of God Amen no this wasn't
[54:59] Judas now the Judas Judas yes he he he
[55:02] worked miracles and and he he he
[55:05] performed uh cast Devils out and things
[55:08] like that but Judas wasn't there
[55:10] receiving a Pentecostal experience with
[55:12] uh with the rest of them because he
[55:15] wasn't predestinated seed he shouted as
[55:18] good as the rest of him did he danced as
[55:20] good as the rest of them did he said
[55:22] amen just as good as the rest of them
[55:24] did ain't that right amen he worked the
[55:27] Miracles just as good as the rest of
[55:30] them did but when it came to going up
[55:33] and receiving the Pentecostal experience
[55:35] he showed his colors hey ain't that
[55:38] right yes sir he couldn't go because you
[55:42] know the prophet said in non-seed there
[55:45] is nothing to Quicken and that's what
[55:48] the Pentecostal experience is about it's
[55:50] a quickening amen it's the Dynamics
[55:53] coming and quickening the mechanics yes
[55:57] sir so brother Brandon would tell us we
[55:59] did not become seed by rebirth we were
[56:02] seed everybody say we were seed
[56:05] therefore we were reborn for only the
[56:09] elect can be reborn ain't that right so
[56:13] he says as the Eternal logos God was
[56:16] manifest in the Sun and in Jesus dwelt
[56:20] the fullness of the godhead bodily and
[56:23] that Eternal one was the father manifest
[56:26] in flesh and thereby gained the title of
[56:30] son even so we everybody say even so we
[56:34] you know we we can we can look and talk
[56:37] about God being in Christ but but I'm so
[56:39] glad God would send a prophet to let us
[56:41] know what what is really going on in
[56:44] this hour even so we Eternal in his
[56:48] thoughts that's why you cannot die
[56:50] that's why eternal life had to come to
[56:52] you amen because you were Eternal in his
[56:55] thoughts amen God just didn't think of
[56:59] you one day as you you prayed a prayer
[57:01] amen or come to the altar started
[57:04] seeking for the Holy Ghost you were
[57:06] Eternal in the thoughts of God Amen see
[57:10] and and so in our turn we became the
[57:13] many membered spoken word seed manifest
[57:17] in flesh and those eternal Eternal
[57:19] thoughts now manifest in flesh are the
[57:22] sons of God are you the Son of God are
[57:25] you a daughter of God Amen see that's
[57:27] that that's something that was a a
[57:30] thought of God and here we are a
[57:33] manifested son and daughter of God Amen
[57:37] and that isn't by mistake ain't that
[57:38] right amen we we've talked about it and
[57:41] you know it but brother brother Brandon
[57:43] talks how Jesus was predestinated to be
[57:46] what he was so pretty no one could take
[57:49] his place many people had tried to take
[57:52] his place then he said well I'm that
[57:54] Messiah and I'm this and they would lead
[57:56] people out in the wilderness and they'd
[57:58] lead this and they would all perish amen
[58:00] with the leader and and these things but
[58:03] but because they tried they they tried
[58:06] to do something they weren't called to
[58:08] do but here was Jesus a man not trying
[58:11] at all he just was ain't that right and
[58:15] he just yielded to himself to the
[58:18] scriptures he yielded himself to the
[58:20] promise of the age because he believed
[58:23] in it do you believe that he believed in
[58:26] it he said the scripture spoke of him
[58:28] and he told them if you would just
[58:31] search the scriptures if you really
[58:32] believed it and and and really
[58:34] understood what the scripture said then
[58:37] searched them for their testifying of
[58:38] who I am amen they're the one that
[58:41] struggled with it they're the one that
[58:43] struggled with who he was because they
[58:45] didn't believe in him amen but he didn't
[58:48] struggle in who he was he just knew that
[58:51] the father had that spoke of him he knew
[58:53] that the father was with him he knew
[58:56] amen exactly that he was with the word
[58:58] can you say Amen well that's the same
[59:01] way with you and I amen uh uh uh we know
[59:05] we know we're not struggling to be a
[59:07] Christian we're not struggling to be
[59:09] sons of God you're You've Got Roots amen
[59:12] not in some family tree You've Got Roots
[59:15] in the mind of God that's where your
[59:17] roots came from that's where your Source
[59:19] comes that's where your start came from
[59:21] was in the mind of God he declared you
[59:24] to be a Son of God he he declared you to
[59:27] be his body in this age you ain't that
[59:30] right we know that God being a spirit he
[59:33] needs a body Amen to work through he
[59:35] needs hands he needs eyes he needs a
[59:37] mouth he needs feed amen he needs a body
[59:41] to express himself through ain't that
[59:43] right amen well he spoke the body of
[59:46] Jesus Christ before the foundation of
[59:48] the world Amen he said that will be the
[59:50] body that I will come and redeem my
[59:52] subjects to me but then he spoke of
[59:55] another body and he saw many membered
[59:57] body amen that would be his bride Not
[1:00:00] only would he be bridegroom but he says
[1:00:02] now I need a bride I need somebody that
[1:00:05] I can work through and they ain't going
[1:00:07] to be a redeemer they're going to be the
[1:00:09] redeemed amen they're not going to be
[1:00:11] bridegroomed but they'll be part of me
[1:00:12] and I will be the bride throughs him
[1:00:15] amen they'll manifest bright ship
[1:00:17] they'll manifest everything that I would
[1:00:20] speak about the bride of Christ and when
[1:00:22] he spoke of them things you were in his
[1:00:25] mind can you say amen amen so this isn't
[1:00:29] by Act accident amen now brother Brandon
[1:00:32] would tell us whatever life was in the
[1:00:35] seed came forth into a plant
[1:00:37] again whatever life was in the seed came
[1:00:41] forth into a plant a man and thens into
[1:00:45] fruits ain't that right so that's the
[1:00:48] law of God it's dark by seed let every
[1:00:51] seed bring forth of its own kind and it
[1:00:54] started the life that was in the seed
[1:00:56] amen came forth into the plant and now
[1:01:00] into the fruit amen the life amen and
[1:01:04] the very same law applies he says to the
[1:01:07] church today whatever seed started the
[1:01:10] church will come forth and be like the
[1:01:13] Original Seed because it is the same
[1:01:15] seed and in these last days the true
[1:01:18] bright Church Christ seed will come to
[1:01:21] The Headstone ain't that right see the
[1:01:24] Pentecost did not come to The Headstone
[1:01:27] amen see they were seed it was God
[1:01:30] planting a Pentecostal seed but in this
[1:01:34] last days the true bright Church cry
[1:01:37] seed will come to The Headstone
[1:01:41] amen see and she will be the Super
[1:01:45] Church a super race do you believe that
[1:01:48] a super Church a super race you think of
[1:01:52] what they've done in the book of Acts
[1:01:53] look what this church amen is going to
[1:01:56] be what she is today she is a super race
[1:01:59] a super church because she has come to
[1:02:02] The Headstone yes sir as she nears him
[1:02:06] they in the bride will be so much like
[1:02:08] him that they will even be in his very
[1:02:11] image in this in order to be United with
[1:02:15] him they will be one everybody say they
[1:02:18] will be one they will be one amen I my
[1:02:22] father are one they will be one
[1:02:26] Hallelujah aren't you glad for that well
[1:02:29] do we got to work to get there
[1:02:30] absolutely not
[1:02:32] amen you were called to be there
[1:02:35] amen you were ordained to be there and
[1:02:37] no one can take your place
[1:02:39] people have tried to do it and they
[1:02:41] failed people have tried and they got
[1:02:43] burned out I've heard that you know
[1:02:45] through through my life of in the
[1:02:47] Pentecostal uh uh growing up people of
[1:02:49] getting burnt out and burn out this and
[1:02:52] preachers burn out and and musicians
[1:02:54] burn out and song leaders burn out and
[1:02:57] this burn out and and I thought oh my
[1:02:59] you know uh uh am I going to get burned
[1:03:02] out you know I don't know you know but
[1:03:04] then I found out that I was
[1:03:06] predestinated for this I can't get
[1:03:08] burned out Christians don't get burned
[1:03:10] out can you say man why it's something
[1:03:14] that's within them you know it'll last
[1:03:16] longer than your physical body will ever
[1:03:18] last that that experience that
[1:03:21] quickening I thought of brother Walker
[1:03:22] out of how feeble he is but you get him
[1:03:24] to talk about God or something that is
[1:03:26] just vibrating in him amen he gets
[1:03:29] excited about what he's doing you hear
[1:03:31] Brother Brown I'm talking about that old
[1:03:32] uh colored man that come up and he's
[1:03:35] feeling sorry for him and and thinking
[1:03:37] man why didn't you get somebody younger
[1:03:39] up there and he's just all been over him
[1:03:41] he said he got to preach in and he got
[1:03:43] excited and he jumped up clicked his
[1:03:46] heels together and said you ain't got
[1:03:47] enough room up here to preach and he
[1:03:49] said he had more room than what he had
[1:03:50] you know amen but what is it it's the
[1:03:53] fire of God that burns within and you
[1:03:56] cannot wear out you cannot burn out
[1:03:59] whatever God God has called you to do
[1:04:01] you wield to he's ordained for you to do
[1:04:04] can you say amen and it's something that
[1:04:07] is Supernatural you can't be held by man
[1:04:09] you can't be held back by man you didn't
[1:04:12] start by man and you won't end by man
[1:04:14] can you say amen that's exactly right so
[1:04:18] they're going to be near him amen
[1:04:21] they'll be in His image and this is in
[1:04:23] order to be United with him they will be
[1:04:26] one they will be the very manifestation
[1:04:29] of the word of the Living God
[1:04:32] now I want you to notice Judas Judas now
[1:04:36] look at his life Judas when the spirit
[1:04:39] of God Came Upon him that Supernatural
[1:04:41] fell upon him he could cast out devils
[1:04:43] and and and and perform Miracles ain't
[1:04:46] that right but then we see what happened
[1:04:48] when the supernatural left him he
[1:04:51] betrayed our lord Jesus ain't that right
[1:04:54] carefus amen could prophesy and tell
[1:04:57] things that would come to pass amen when
[1:04:59] the supernatural rested upon Him amen
[1:05:02] but when the supernatural left him he
[1:05:04] offered Christ up to be crucified hey
[1:05:07] ain't that right yes sir he he didn't
[1:05:10] believe it at all he didn't believe that
[1:05:12] Jesus was the Vindicated word at all but
[1:05:14] he could do something when the
[1:05:16] supernatural was upon Him amen Balaam
[1:05:19] prophesied and foretold of things do you
[1:05:22] realize there to them things that he
[1:05:23] prophesied up are still coming to pass
[1:05:25] today amen a prophet but yet the Bible
[1:05:28] called him a false prophet but he could
[1:05:31] prophesy when the spirit of the Lord
[1:05:32] come upon him and be Act in his prophecy
[1:05:36] and tell exactly the things that are
[1:05:38] would come to pass but when the spirit
[1:05:41] of the Lord left him we see what he
[1:05:45] really was and he calls to Israel to
[1:05:48] stumble ain't that right to where God
[1:05:51] would never forgive them for their act
[1:05:54] of idolatry amen safe and so uh uh these
[1:05:59] men would return Amen to what they was
[1:06:02] before the supernatural Came Upon them
[1:06:06] amen but see we we find that that is
[1:06:09] different amen from the elect of God we
[1:06:12] find it is different a man from what
[1:06:15] happened on the day of Pentecost amen
[1:06:18] the spirit of God didn't just come upon
[1:06:20] them and cause them to dance and to
[1:06:22] shout and to speak in tongues and and to
[1:06:25] do whatever and then lived and and they
[1:06:28] were just the average person but Peter
[1:06:30] never did return back to his old life
[1:06:33] none of them men and women returned back
[1:06:37] to their old life hey ain't that right
[1:06:39] amen even before Pentecost before the
[1:06:41] Holy Ghost Came Upon them Peter denied
[1:06:44] the Lord that bought or denied the Lord
[1:06:47] denied him and that of even knowing him
[1:06:49] because he was scared that they would
[1:06:51] kill him too amen but look at the end of
[1:06:53] Peter's life amen knowing that they were
[1:06:57] going to crucify him amen he was walking
[1:07:00] out they're going to escape history says
[1:07:02] that as he was walking out of the city
[1:07:04] amen he meets the Lord and has uh and
[1:07:08] he's going up to the city and and Peter
[1:07:11] asked him Lord where are you going he
[1:07:13] says I'm going to be crucified again and
[1:07:16] and and it says that Peter understood
[1:07:18] what they what he meant by that and he
[1:07:20] turned around and went to the city and
[1:07:23] offered himself up Amen to be crucified
[1:07:26] and he told him if you're going to
[1:07:28] crucify me do not crucify me the way
[1:07:30] you've done the Lord amen crucify me
[1:07:33] upside down for I'm not not worthy Amen
[1:07:36] to be crucified the way he was amen a
[1:07:39] man that once had denied the Lord amen
[1:07:42] scared of being crucified now I'm full
[1:07:45] of the power and the unction of the Holy
[1:07:48] Ghost oh my that's that's what it'll do
[1:07:51] to you ain't that right amen see so we
[1:07:54] find uh the spirit of God the anointing
[1:07:58] uh anointing a person doesn't make them
[1:08:00] the body of Christ amen for we realize
[1:08:04] there's all kinds of anointed ones
[1:08:06] Matthew 24 24 for there shall arise
[1:08:10] false christs false anointed ones ain't
[1:08:13] that right false prophets and shall show
[1:08:16] great signs and wonders in so much if it
[1:08:19] were possible they shall deceive the
[1:08:22] very elect now I want you you know what
[1:08:24] the prophet said about the Antichrist he
[1:08:26] said the Antichrist will be Pentecost to
[1:08:28] the DOT
[1:08:30] ain't that right so people that don't
[1:08:32] believe in the Pentecostal experience
[1:08:34] amen even the Antichrist knows better
[1:08:36] than you do ain't that right they know
[1:08:39] better they say well we don't need gifts
[1:08:41] for Antichrist knows better than that
[1:08:42] nonsense well we don't need this we
[1:08:45] don't need the dancing and we don't need
[1:08:46] to shouting we don't need the Miracles
[1:08:48] we don't need the all of that the devil
[1:08:50] knows better than that amen but the
[1:08:52] Antichrist that deceiving spirit will be
[1:08:55] Pentecost to the dot ain't that right he
[1:08:59] said uh brother Brown said see the whole
[1:09:01] thing is in such a great conglomeration
[1:09:04] of every kind of mix-up and Satan with
[1:09:07] all of his kindness come in and
[1:09:10] impersonated just to the dot almost to
[1:09:13] the dot there's one only one way
[1:09:15] everybody say there's only one way only
[1:09:18] one way that you can absolutely be sure
[1:09:21] is check the word by word word by word
[1:09:26] that's the only way you can can you say
[1:09:29] amen amen so when they look at them
[1:09:32] people on the day of Pentecost and saw
[1:09:34] them doing what they done amen they all
[1:09:37] of a sudden the critics were were saying
[1:09:39] well they're drunk and they're this
[1:09:41] they're that but Peter understanding
[1:09:43] amen the the confusion amen and what
[1:09:47] they were trying to do they were trying
[1:09:48] to put this experience to some human
[1:09:50] thing amen but he would stand up and say
[1:09:54] no this is the word being made manifest
[1:09:56] can you say man it is the word being
[1:09:59] made manifest and God started his church
[1:10:03] by a Pentecostal experience amen and we
[1:10:06] as we read last Sunday the Pentecostal
[1:10:08] experience is his word made flesh in you
[1:10:12] can you say Amen it's his word made
[1:10:15] flesh in you yes sir and so we we find
[1:10:19] that they that they that was up there in
[1:10:22] the upper room that 120 and everyone
[1:10:25] after them a man that received the
[1:10:28] Pentecostal experience were changed they
[1:10:32] were changed can you say Amen they
[1:10:35] weren't trying to serve God on their
[1:10:37] intellect they were changed amen it's a
[1:10:40] supernatural happening you cannot make a
[1:10:43] carnal man cannot join this Bride of the
[1:10:46] Living God that it can amen we couldn't
[1:10:49] join it it took God to give us a
[1:10:52] supernatural birth living inside of us
[1:10:57] making the word live
[1:11:00] brother Branham says if you notice
[1:11:02] Solomon never varied one bit from the
[1:11:05] pattern that Moses saw on Mount Sinai in
[1:11:09] heaven when Moses when he returned from
[1:11:12] his vision pitched the tent and made it
[1:11:15] just exactly like he saw in heaven and
[1:11:18] when Solomon built the temple he made it
[1:11:20] just exactly the way he seen the pattern
[1:11:22] the type and Moses pitched the tent a
[1:11:24] Perpetual type because it was moved from
[1:11:27] place to place
[1:11:29] but Solomon he made the Tabernacle just
[1:11:32] exactly in the fashion that Moses had
[1:11:34] seen in heaven it was all put together
[1:11:36] set in order just exactly what a
[1:11:39] spiritual application we could apply
[1:11:41] here that we are never to leave the
[1:11:43] scripture stay exactly with the pattern
[1:11:46] that's the reason I believe that the way
[1:11:49] the first church was patterned that's
[1:11:51] the way the next one should be patterned
[1:11:52] that's the way everyone should be
[1:11:54] patterned just the way it was at the
[1:11:57] beginning and I just believe that God
[1:11:59] has it that way I believe the real
[1:12:02] church can you say Amen another place
[1:12:04] said what the church was at Pentecost is
[1:12:07] the standard that's the pattern see
[1:12:09] there is no other pattern everybody say
[1:12:11] there is no other pattern amen they want
[1:12:14] us to get us away from that Pentecostal
[1:12:16] beginning amen they want to steer us
[1:12:18] away but here's your Prophet saying if
[1:12:20] that is the pattern amen now tell me
[1:12:23] verbally tell me verbatim where he said
[1:12:25] I've changed that that ain't true amen
[1:12:28] we find it all all the way through this
[1:12:30] the devil that is telling us that the
[1:12:33] apostolic agencies it's the devil that
[1:12:35] is telling us get away from all that we
[1:12:37] don't need that junk anymore that's the
[1:12:40] devil that is doing that but he himself
[1:12:42] when he comes as the Antichrist spirit
[1:12:45] in this age he is Pentecost to the dot
[1:12:49] can you say Amen it's so close that it
[1:12:51] would deceive the elect
[1:12:54] ain't that right but what he thinks
[1:12:56] Pentecost to be amen uh uh he can't obey
[1:13:00] the word he cannot fulfill all the word
[1:13:02] ain't that right amen he's like a Judas
[1:13:05] that will walk with Jesus talk with
[1:13:07] Jesus you know so close with Jesus to
[1:13:11] where it that that when when Jesus said
[1:13:13] one of you will betray me everybody
[1:13:15] looked and says he said I they they had
[1:13:18] no inkling that he was referring to
[1:13:19] Judas it would be so close in this last
[1:13:22] day but Judas did not go to Pentecost he
[1:13:27] could not receive that Pentecostal
[1:13:29] experience ain't that right but every
[1:13:31] member of this body will receive the
[1:13:34] Pentecostal experience that's the only
[1:13:36] way you're going to make it in that to
[1:13:38] be this body of Jesus Christ you can be
[1:13:40] so smart you can educate and and
[1:13:43] educated in the Bible to where you know
[1:13:45] that Bible backward and forward you know
[1:13:47] the message backward and forward but
[1:13:49] until you receive a Pentecostal
[1:13:51] experience you are not part of the body
[1:13:53] of Jesus Christ can you say Amen yes sir
[1:13:57] I know they're trying to do it with
[1:13:59] psychology I know they're trying to amen
[1:14:01] uh and all they're doing is just keeping
[1:14:03] teaching us how to cope amen with life
[1:14:06] amen God doesn't want you to learn how
[1:14:08] to cope with life God wants you to cast
[1:14:11] them Devils out God wants you to defy
[1:14:14] them Devils God wants you to overcome
[1:14:16] every devil that is here in laodicea
[1:14:20] overcome the spirit of drunk overcome
[1:14:22] the spirit of flawless I think they call
[1:14:25] it flolic uh uh where it's just comedy
[1:14:28] and laughing and just reveling and and
[1:14:30] all these things and and God wants you
[1:14:32] to overcome them things amen and it
[1:14:35] doesn't mean you can't rejoice and be
[1:14:37] happy in the Lord amen but you getting
[1:14:39] your happiness off of Television amen
[1:14:41] shame on you amen you're getting your
[1:14:44] happiness off of these comedians I don't
[1:14:46] care if they're Christian comedians or
[1:14:47] what shame on you the joy of the Lord is
[1:14:51] our strength can you say Amen the joy of
[1:14:55] the Lord amen it's not entertainment
[1:14:57] that makes us happy amen it's not
[1:14:59] because we've got a a million dollars in
[1:15:02] the bank that makes us happy we ought to
[1:15:04] be happy if we've only got one dollar in
[1:15:06] the bank we ought to be happy just to be
[1:15:09] content in God knowing that he's done a
[1:15:12] work within us he's the joy
[1:15:15] he's the source of our joy
[1:15:19] ain't that right
[1:15:21] so what the church was that Pentecost is
[1:15:23] the standard
[1:15:27] he says no matter what the scholars say
[1:15:29] God has not changed that pattern
[1:15:32] what God did at Pentecost he has to keep
[1:15:34] on doing
[1:15:35] until the church ages close
[1:15:38] can you say Amen
[1:15:40] that's right
[1:15:42] and brother brown or Paul Peter said
[1:15:43] this this promises to you and to as many
[1:15:46] as the Lord thy God shall call
[1:15:49] and if God is still calling then this
[1:15:51] Pentecostal blessing is still for us
[1:15:54] the Pentecostal experience is still here
[1:15:56] can you say Amen
[1:15:58] so every person that is baptized into
[1:16:01] the body of Christ is quickened to the
[1:16:04] word
[1:16:05] now that that's not now the supernatural
[1:16:08] came on Judas but it didn't quickening
[1:16:10] do the word
[1:16:11] amen the supernatural Came Upon upon on
[1:16:15] Caiaphas and Balaam and and all these
[1:16:17] things but it didn't Quicken them to the
[1:16:19] word ain't that right oh yeah they they
[1:16:21] were able to do things uh foretell
[1:16:24] things prophesied dance Shout cast out
[1:16:27] Devils all these things but it never
[1:16:29] quickened them to the word you know what
[1:16:31] the Holy Spirit does for you and I hope
[1:16:33] this is all right today but I don't care
[1:16:35] if you're in the worst Valley of your
[1:16:36] life the worst trial the holy spirit is
[1:16:38] still there to keep you quick and do the
[1:16:40] word
[1:16:41] can you say amen amen and that's that's
[1:16:44] true we this this ups and downs all the
[1:16:47] time and ups and downs and all the time
[1:16:49] and and all these things that you know
[1:16:51] there's some people it you just want to
[1:16:54] stay away from if they're in The Valleys
[1:16:55] you you just you want to just stay away
[1:16:57] from them amen because you don't know
[1:16:59] what they're going to be like amen they
[1:17:01] they might be a monster one day you know
[1:17:03] and and then get back on the valley and
[1:17:06] they're just as sweet and kind and
[1:17:07] whatever see amen but see the word the
[1:17:10] Holy Ghost quickens us to the word and
[1:17:13] it's a constantly quicking it's a it's a
[1:17:15] constantly see and so the word seed the
[1:17:18] gene seed is in them and is quickened
[1:17:21] ain't that right that's that's what is
[1:17:23] quickened in US is the word seed that
[1:17:26] Gene seed thought of God is in us and it
[1:17:30] is quickened now the 120 they had to
[1:17:33] wait before they received the Holy Ghost
[1:17:35] and they had to tarry in the city of
[1:17:38] Jerusalem amen until they were endued
[1:17:40] for power from on high but you don't
[1:17:43] have to wait anymore you you don't have
[1:17:46] to tarry amen uh uh brother Brandon said
[1:17:50] that you don't they had to do that to
[1:17:52] wait for the day of Pentecost Amen to
[1:17:54] fulfill scriptures and these things see
[1:17:57] but you don't have to wait to receive
[1:17:58] the Holy Ghost amen but but you must
[1:18:02] receive exactly the same thing they
[1:18:05] received
[1:18:06] can you say man and if you receive what
[1:18:10] they received it will Quicken you to the
[1:18:13] word for this age
[1:18:15] you believe that see but but but don't
[1:18:18] sink for a moment that we are totally
[1:18:21] different than what they are or that we
[1:18:24] are receive something different than
[1:18:26] what they have received and and and that
[1:18:29] that the you know that that we are to
[1:18:32] cut all of that off from us and act as
[1:18:34] though it really didn't exist or that
[1:18:37] that is history amen because that was
[1:18:39] the work of God
[1:18:42] okay so you're right it was the work of
[1:18:45] God and if that same God that birthed
[1:18:47] that church and that's and done that
[1:18:49] that same God is going to be in us today
[1:18:53] do you believe that yes sir see so so
[1:18:56] the message of the hour I did not cut us
[1:19:00] off from what God started in the
[1:19:03] beginning what the message came to do is
[1:19:06] to cut us out of these denominations
[1:19:10] that we could come back to being what
[1:19:13] was in the beginning can you say man to
[1:19:16] cut us out of the Creeds and the dogmas
[1:19:19] and all of these things that that has
[1:19:22] been filtered through or has come out
[1:19:25] through the church and all of these
[1:19:26] things amen the message of the hour is
[1:19:29] here to cause us Amen to return to the
[1:19:33] power that the first church had
[1:19:36] forward
[1:19:37] brother Branham says in the last day in
[1:19:39] the in the last stage there will be a
[1:19:41] group rise up
[1:19:43] the true Bride of the last day and she
[1:19:45] will listen to the spirit
[1:19:47] in that day a gross a gross uh see in
[1:19:51] that day of gross Darkness the light
[1:19:53] will return by the pure word
[1:19:56] ain't that right pure word not by Dogma
[1:19:59] Creed nothing all that mixed up by pure
[1:20:02] word
[1:20:04] and we will return everybody say we will
[1:20:07] return
[1:20:08] to the power of Pentecost
[1:20:10] to welcome back the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:20:13] did he lie about that
[1:20:15] nope that's exactly what we have today
[1:20:19] we will return back to the power of
[1:20:23] Pentecost a man to welcome back the holy
[1:20:27] the Lord Jesus Christ so again God
[1:20:30] planted his word and I'm not going to
[1:20:32] keep you long but God planted his word
[1:20:34] or uh a seed and the day of Pentecost it
[1:20:37] was a Pentecostal seed it was a perfect
[1:20:39] seed all the potentials laid in that
[1:20:43] seat
[1:20:44] ain't that right and and so the book of
[1:20:47] Acts showed as to what kind of seed it
[1:20:50] was that God planted but again they did
[1:20:54] not fulfill uh the prophecy that was
[1:20:57] foretold in the story of Ruth and Boaz
[1:21:00] they did not fulfill the prophecy that
[1:21:03] was foretold in the story of Esther they
[1:21:06] did not fulfill the prophecy that was
[1:21:08] foretold in the story of Ellie easier
[1:21:11] taking a man Rebecca amen uh to meet
[1:21:15] Isaac amen they didn't fulfill the
[1:21:18] prophecy that was foretold in the story
[1:21:21] where the double portion of Elijah's
[1:21:23] Spirit Came Upon Elisha ain't that right
[1:21:27] amen they were a perfect seed but they
[1:21:30] did not fulfill these these prophecies
[1:21:33] and and many more prophecies a man was
[1:21:37] not fulfilled many things that they did
[1:21:39] not fulfill for it had to wait until
[1:21:41] this time ain't that right see but the
[1:21:45] potential was there the penitential was
[1:21:48] there but yet they didn't do the Greater
[1:21:50] Works that Jesus said that we would do
[1:21:53] for it was for this day
[1:21:56] ain't that right now brother Brown
[1:21:58] talked to Elijah fixing to be taken up
[1:22:01] in the chariot
[1:22:02] uh and and he says he was tired and
[1:22:05] weary and there was a chariot hooked
[1:22:07] across the river to take him up home
[1:22:10] with the horses of fire and did you
[1:22:12] notice then when Elijah and Elisha
[1:22:15] crossed the river the school of prophets
[1:22:17] was up there watching and Elijah took
[1:22:20] his mantle
[1:22:23] and struck the river
[1:22:25] and when it did it divided and went
[1:22:27] across and he said to the young Prophet
[1:22:30] what are you following me for what do
[1:22:32] you wish see and he said that a double
[1:22:35] portion of your spirit come upon me
[1:22:37] a double portion of that Mighty Prophet
[1:22:40] come up on me and he said you've asked
[1:22:43] the hard thing but if you see me when I
[1:22:45] go away then I will then it'll come upon
[1:22:48] you so you can just imagine how he wants
[1:22:50] the prophet now in that day that Prophet
[1:22:53] was the word for he was the
[1:22:54] manifestation of the word to the world
[1:22:56] and he knew there had to be a greater
[1:23:00] Ministry come because it required a
[1:23:04] greater thing
[1:23:06] you with me he knew there had to be
[1:23:09] something greater come for it required a
[1:23:13] greater thing
[1:23:15] and when Jesus was here on Earth see uh
[1:23:18] he said he was the Elijah see these
[1:23:22] things that I do shall you do also
[1:23:24] greater than these things shall you do
[1:23:26] because I go unto my father ain't that
[1:23:29] right so he's using this for a different
[1:23:31] type amen see because I go to my father
[1:23:35] now how are you going to do it watch him
[1:23:37] and who is he the word what's the word
[1:23:42] Keep Your Eyes Upon that word ain't that
[1:23:45] right watch him see and when it comes to
[1:23:48] creation of things it's true Jesus never
[1:23:50] writes straight out created anything and
[1:23:53] brought it into existence he took a
[1:23:55] substance first and he took water and
[1:23:58] made wine he took bread and made more
[1:24:00] bread he took fish and made more fish
[1:24:03] but everybody say but
[1:24:05] he promised a greater thing see he
[1:24:10] promised that greater things than this
[1:24:12] would be done you see now why it's in a
[1:24:16] more evil day than it was when he was
[1:24:20] here
[1:24:21] ain't that right it's in a more evil day
[1:24:25] than it was in in and and if Satan can
[1:24:28] get our minds off the Supernatural and
[1:24:31] just believe that them things don't
[1:24:33] happen anymore amen look where you're
[1:24:36] gonna stand but it's in a greater day it
[1:24:39] has it has to be a greater works for
[1:24:42] this is a more evil day than ever before
[1:24:47] it's a more in a more evil day than it
[1:24:49] was when he was here see it's still him
[1:24:52] everybody's saying still him it's still
[1:24:55] him it's still the same God but he's
[1:24:57] using your Tabernacle
[1:25:00] Hallelujah
[1:25:04] now we started God started building that
[1:25:07] church
[1:25:08] on the day of Pentecost to build a
[1:25:09] masterpiece
[1:25:11] a seed that he planted
[1:25:13] but we are living in the age where God
[1:25:15] has completed or is finishing his
[1:25:18] masterpiece
[1:25:19] do you believe that go listen to the
[1:25:22] masterpiece
[1:25:23] listen to it they without us cannot be
[1:25:26] made perfect
[1:25:28] amen the first church is resting upon us
[1:25:31] all the other Church ages are resting
[1:25:33] upon us
[1:25:34] can you say Amen the responsibility is
[1:25:37] upon your shoulders don't don't waver in
[1:25:40] in this keep your eyes upon the word
[1:25:44] ain't that right Satan's doing
[1:25:46] everything he can to stop this little
[1:25:48] bride but he ain't going to be able to
[1:25:49] stop it God has sent something greater
[1:25:52] remember when the enemy come in like a
[1:25:54] flood the spirit of the Lord will raise
[1:25:57] up a standard and when has the enemy
[1:25:59] come in like a flood in this age right
[1:26:02] now
[1:26:04] and you say man it didn't come in like a
[1:26:07] flood on the day of Pentecost he came in
[1:26:09] like a flood on this day
[1:26:13] he's been watching the enemy so don't
[1:26:15] think he's not don't think the enemy
[1:26:17] sneaks in unaware
[1:26:19] don't think you're in a you know you're
[1:26:21] in your trials and God doesn't know
[1:26:22] don't think you're being tempted and God
[1:26:24] doesn't know these things he knows it
[1:26:27] and he says and when he does come in
[1:26:29] like a flood I'll be there to raise up a
[1:26:31] standard
[1:26:33] and what is that standard he makes the
[1:26:36] word more real
[1:26:37] he makes the word more real the word
[1:26:41] becoming more real in your flesh than
[1:26:43] ever before
[1:26:44] [Music]
[1:26:47] ain't that right
[1:26:49] so we're at the finishing touches of the
[1:26:51] masterpiece
[1:26:53] yes and as Michelangelo you know now
[1:26:57] brother Brown talks about it in the
[1:26:58] Masterpiece about Michelangelo working
[1:27:00] all them years he had something in his
[1:27:02] mind
[1:27:04] and he he thought well I'm going to
[1:27:06] bring what is in my mind to reality
[1:27:08] and he labored and he labored he took
[1:27:10] old piece of Rock
[1:27:14] to make his masterpiece
[1:27:18] and and we could say that's what he done
[1:27:20] on the day of Pentecost
[1:27:22] he took a group of people
[1:27:26] start making something
[1:27:28] ain't that right
[1:27:31] and and we find that all of them years
[1:27:33] that he he labored
[1:27:36] he finally got it done
[1:27:38] and when he stood back
[1:27:41] he's tired and weary
[1:27:44] all them hours but he looked back and
[1:27:46] what was here
[1:27:48] was there in front of him
[1:27:50] and become so real he lost his senses
[1:27:54] and he struck it and then he was his
[1:27:55] hammer and said speak right speak he got
[1:27:59] so inspired by it
[1:28:01] oh my his his thoughts his his dreams
[1:28:05] he'd become a reality
[1:28:07] Abraham said see when it when it was
[1:28:09] completed he was so inspired by it till
[1:28:11] he thought his own Masterpiece should
[1:28:14] speak back to him and he struck it
[1:28:17] across the leg and hollered speak
[1:28:19] and it made a flaw on it made a flaw in
[1:28:21] the image now to me the flaw was what
[1:28:23] made it the masterpiece
[1:28:25] maybe to the mind that might think
[1:28:27] different you think that spoiled it but
[1:28:29] to me it made it what it was because of
[1:28:33] so many years of careful work and tolls
[1:28:36] and inspiration and so forth of making
[1:28:39] it his tools had proved not to be in
[1:28:42] vain
[1:28:43] it was perfect
[1:28:45] that's why cried outs speak
[1:28:48] because he had seen before him that he
[1:28:51] was able to achieve to bring to pass the
[1:28:54] vision that was in his mind and
[1:28:56] therefore under inspiration he done
[1:28:58] something out of the reason out of the
[1:29:00] ordinary he struck it in hall or speak
[1:29:02] see he wouldn't have done it if you if
[1:29:05] he had just thought but he didn't think
[1:29:07] it was inspiration of seeing what it's
[1:29:09] what he had in his mind setting there
[1:29:12] perfectly before him ate that right see
[1:29:15] what was in his mind had become real it
[1:29:18] become positive therefore it sprung into
[1:29:21] him and it was so real that he must cry
[1:29:23] out speak well then he goes into Jesus
[1:29:26] right how he was God's perfect
[1:29:28] Masterpiece what God had in his mind
[1:29:31] amen he labored and he labored all them
[1:29:34] years what two thousand years or 4 000
[1:29:38] years he labored and he labored and he
[1:29:40] labored profit after profit patriarch
[1:29:43] after patriarch amen Through the Ages
[1:29:45] there he labored and then there stood
[1:29:48] the perfect Masterpiece what he had in
[1:29:51] his mind what he had ordained was there
[1:29:53] in reality before him Hallelujah he said
[1:29:57] the perfect one no fault in him at all
[1:30:01] you get a church no fault in him at all
[1:30:05] they found fault with him the religious
[1:30:07] found fault with him but when God looked
[1:30:09] at him there was no fault it was
[1:30:12] perfection
[1:30:14] what God had in his mind was standing
[1:30:17] there faultless
[1:30:20] so the perfect reflected the Builder
[1:30:23] himself see his own image was reflected
[1:30:26] in his work God and Christ were won and
[1:30:29] so much until he put his own Spirit into
[1:30:31] him and then the even the image and the
[1:30:34] Builder became one ain't that right and
[1:30:37] what was he that perfect Masterpiece he
[1:30:39] was the Fulfillment of all the Old
[1:30:41] Testament scriptures that's right and it
[1:30:44] was on the mount Transfiguration that a
[1:30:46] voice come out of the cloud amen spoke
[1:30:48] from that cloud and said that this is my
[1:30:51] beloved Son in whom I'm well pleased to
[1:30:53] live in to dwell in right in whom I'm
[1:30:57] pleased to dwell in hear ye him ain't
[1:31:00] that right and it was just a few days
[1:31:02] after the prophet said that he was
[1:31:04] smitten at Calvary
[1:31:07] amen that's right the Bible says Isaiah
[1:31:10] says he was smitten of God he was
[1:31:12] wounded for our transgressions he was
[1:31:14] bruised for our iniquity by his stripes
[1:31:17] we were healed Moses had the potential
[1:31:19] ain't that right Joseph had potential
[1:31:24] they all had the potentials for they
[1:31:26] reflected Jesus Christ David had the
[1:31:29] potentials
[1:31:30] but they was not the masterpiece
[1:31:33] amen they just was a portion of him
[1:31:36] ain't that right but when Jesus came on
[1:31:39] the scene the prophet said he was the
[1:31:42] Fulfillment he was the Fulfillment of
[1:31:44] everything God had promised he was the
[1:31:47] perfect identical image of the promise
[1:31:51] do you see where you're at now
[1:31:56] God could look at his promise in the
[1:31:58] word and look at Christ and say that's
[1:32:00] it
[1:32:02] ain't that right the word became flesh
[1:32:06] perfect perfect masterpiece
[1:32:09] yes yes sir
[1:32:12] you think of it when you look at the
[1:32:14] word you're this is a mirror you should
[1:32:16] see yourself
[1:32:18] well what what what about God looking in
[1:32:20] the in this mirror what are you gonna
[1:32:22] see
[1:32:24] he's gonna see you
[1:32:27] in the word
[1:32:28] I can't help it but when he looks at
[1:32:30] that word it looks at his promises he
[1:32:32] can't help and look at this bride
[1:32:34] look at you sitting this morning
[1:32:37] there they are it's Perfection again
[1:32:41] and you know what there's no fault
[1:32:45] God can't find fault with you
[1:32:47] [Applause]
[1:32:50] man may be able to find fault with you
[1:32:52] the church may be able to find fault
[1:32:54] with you but God can't find fault
[1:32:56] you are his workmanship you are the
[1:32:59] finale of what he's doing
[1:33:04] can you say Amen you see it's the thing
[1:33:07] that God's looking at God never looked
[1:33:09] at your sin God never looked at your
[1:33:10] failures he doesn't look at them now
[1:33:13] yes he's got an atonement there but
[1:33:15] don't think for a moment that he's just
[1:33:17] choosing you over everybody else and
[1:33:19] overlooking you like like maybe a parent
[1:33:21] does and overlooks all these your fault
[1:33:23] I'm telling you the truth there is no
[1:33:25] fault
[1:33:27] why you are his workmanship
[1:33:31] he's not looking at the natural he's
[1:33:33] looking at what he had in his mind
[1:33:36] can you say amen and we have come to
[1:33:39] what is in his mind
[1:33:41] the material or the thoughts of God has
[1:33:44] become material once again
[1:33:48] foreign
[1:33:54] [Applause]
[1:33:55] see therefore he was the perfect
[1:33:58] identical image of the promise
[1:34:00] therefore all Promises of the Old
[1:34:02] Testament was met in Jesus Christ it
[1:34:05] couldn't be met in Moses it couldn't be
[1:34:07] met in any of the prophets but it was
[1:34:09] met in the Masterpiece it matched
[1:34:12] everybody say it matched all that it
[1:34:15] said it was going to be
[1:34:17] Jesus Christ that perfect Masterpiece
[1:34:20] matched all scriptures
[1:34:21] [Applause]
[1:34:23] of what it said it would be
[1:34:26] now
[1:34:28] he doesn't just stop there and give us a
[1:34:30] history lesson
[1:34:32] he brings it on and says so will the
[1:34:36] church
[1:34:37] have to be a match to everything that
[1:34:39] God has promised
[1:34:42] can you say Amen
[1:34:44] God didn't now now listen you know God
[1:34:46] didn't just build establish a
[1:34:48] Pentecostal experience with the 120. I
[1:34:52] know you know there's some people say
[1:34:53] well they should they they could have
[1:34:54] made it in the Rapture and they could
[1:34:56] have been the Seven Seals was open in
[1:34:58] that time and all that I personally
[1:35:00] don't see it that way
[1:35:02] hey man there's only one time the angel
[1:35:04] of God opened up the the book
[1:35:08] and that was in this day in 1963
[1:35:11] . can you say Amen there were too many
[1:35:14] scriptures to be fulfilled that they did
[1:35:17] not fulfill
[1:35:18] and and and don't think that God planned
[1:35:21] it and say well I was going to do it but
[1:35:22] they fail and so I can't do it now
[1:35:24] that's that's brother Ram tells us it
[1:35:26] was in the plan of God for that seed to
[1:35:28] be buried and die and rot
[1:35:32] can you say amen and if it didn't die we
[1:35:36] couldn't these other scriptures could
[1:35:38] not be fulfilled because we were
[1:35:40] predestinated to fulfill it
[1:35:42] we are the finale We Are The Rapture
[1:35:46] people
[1:35:51] amen
[1:35:55] so he said see so will the church have
[1:35:59] to be a match to everything that God has
[1:36:00] promised it must be the peace that
[1:36:02] smitten off of it so if the original is
[1:36:06] the word so will the subjects that's
[1:36:08] been taken from it be the word to match
[1:36:11] its side
[1:36:13] now that's where we stand today do you
[1:36:15] believe that that's where we stand
[1:36:17] notice he says he fulfilled the Old
[1:36:19] Testament now it's the New Testament
[1:36:21] another piece to be fulfilled
[1:36:23] the new the new and old is his husband
[1:36:26] and wife and had taken the new or the
[1:36:29] old to foreshow the new Christ come the
[1:36:32] Masterpiece to fulfill that now his
[1:36:34] bride will fulfill everything that's in
[1:36:37] the New Testament
[1:36:39] right
[1:36:41] he started on the day of Pentecost to
[1:36:43] build another Masterpiece The Original
[1:36:45] Seed word started in the first church
[1:36:47] what was it the seed word the word
[1:36:51] manifest promised that had been given
[1:36:53] Joel 7 it or Joel said it shall come to
[1:36:57] pass in the last days saith God I'll
[1:36:59] pour out my spirit upon All Flesh your
[1:37:01] sons and daughters shall prophesy your
[1:37:03] old man shall dream dreams your young
[1:37:05] men shall see Visions what he would do
[1:37:08] in the last uh days two thousand last
[1:37:10] two thousand years notice it started out
[1:37:13] as the original as Jesus said the word
[1:37:17] of God is a seed that a sore sold he was
[1:37:20] the sower the seed was the word any seed
[1:37:23] that abides alone doesn't never does
[1:37:25] anything it's got to fall into the
[1:37:28] ground to bring forth its production
[1:37:31] again
[1:37:32] ain't that right
[1:37:36] you'll you'll never get an Apple just
[1:37:39] from a seed
[1:37:41] you can say it's an apple seed and it is
[1:37:44] but if you're wanting apples you better
[1:37:46] do something with that seed
[1:37:49] ain't that right
[1:37:52] and God planted a church
[1:37:55] seed
[1:37:56] and they had the potentials
[1:37:59] that in order to get what God really
[1:38:01] wanted in his mind
[1:38:03] that seed had to die and rot
[1:38:07] and come back up again
[1:38:10] right
[1:38:12] so he said see this seed that perfect
[1:38:15] Church fell to the ground that and I see
[1:38:17] a room when she become a denomination
[1:38:19] now historians remember you that's going
[1:38:22] to hear this state check it up and find
[1:38:24] out if see if it's right uh uh the
[1:38:27] church died and I see a Rome when she
[1:38:28] took dogmas and Creeds in the stead of
[1:38:30] the original word what was it God had
[1:38:33] showed by that first church that he was
[1:38:35] God he had a church perfected but the
[1:38:37] church like all other seeds must
[1:38:39] everybody say must fall into the ground
[1:38:42] and die
[1:38:43] now it fell into the ground and died and
[1:38:47] wasted away
[1:38:49] ain't that right
[1:38:51] and you know what the prophet said the
[1:38:53] denominations is your dirt
[1:38:55] that the seed was buried in
[1:38:58] the denominations was the dirt he said
[1:39:01] there is where the word was crucified
[1:39:03] and they accepted dogma and for hundreds
[1:39:06] and hundreds of years of Dark Ages the
[1:39:09] power and manifestation of the word was
[1:39:12] hid from the world and only Catholicism
[1:39:15] ruled ain't that right but then as we
[1:39:18] hear you know read the the seed shall
[1:39:21] not be aired with the shark and the
[1:39:23] other one the seed is not here with the
[1:39:24] shock in and so much you know brother
[1:39:27] bran brings that in and how the the
[1:39:28] seeds started to sprout yet in the mark
[1:39:31] in the days of Martin Luther right as a
[1:39:34] what tussle I think or stalking and then
[1:39:38] it came up a little bit more into John
[1:39:40] wesleys amen that that that coming from
[1:39:43] growing up now amen uh as the tussle see
[1:39:48] and yet these two stages didn't even
[1:39:50] look like anything like the seed at all
[1:39:53] ain't that right but then here come that
[1:39:56] Pentecostal age
[1:39:59] and we thought
[1:40:02] it was thought to be the real thing
[1:40:05] because it's looked so much like the
[1:40:08] seed
[1:40:09] but it wasn't seed
[1:40:11] because they don't denominated
[1:40:14] they went the way of traditions
[1:40:16] they went the way of creeds
[1:40:18] ain't that right yes sir see amen see so
[1:40:23] it it was the shock Amanda not the seed
[1:40:27] but brother Brown says now watch The
[1:40:29] Gospel is going to come out through
[1:40:31] Luther through Wesley into Pentecost and
[1:40:33] at the last days it'll deceive the very
[1:40:36] elected if possible the elected ain't
[1:40:39] that right oh Pentecostal Brethren can't
[1:40:42] you see the wheat in its first beginning
[1:40:44] is just like the seed when it begins to
[1:40:48] form uh they did uh form like the seed
[1:40:52] but it's the husk it denominated exactly
[1:40:55] done the same thing they did down here
[1:40:57] in Luther Revelation 17 it proves the
[1:41:00] same thing of the churches now the
[1:41:02] grains seed the in the original fell at
[1:41:05] nicia for it was the first denomination
[1:41:08] notice here the life that was in the
[1:41:10] stock tousle all now ends up in the seed
[1:41:16] the life that come out of the original
[1:41:19] seed come up through the different
[1:41:21] processes three different processes and
[1:41:23] then turns back till its original
[1:41:26] condition and today we are back to seed
[1:41:30] again
[1:41:34] Satan has tried his best to denominate
[1:41:37] this message
[1:41:40] tried his best you realize how hard
[1:41:43] Satan has worked he has been Sons he has
[1:41:47] been successful in every age
[1:41:50] to bring it back to denomination back to
[1:41:52] denomination
[1:41:55] so in this age
[1:41:58] he's doing everything possible
[1:42:03] to make us a denomination
[1:42:06] but it will never go to a denomination
[1:42:10] brother Brown said it won't it won't
[1:42:12] cause your seed again
[1:42:15] can you say Amen so just to think of
[1:42:18] that and I you know I was telling some
[1:42:20] ministers the other day I really
[1:42:21] appreciate them
[1:42:24] through all the false failures and
[1:42:26] disagreements and all these things that
[1:42:28] may be
[1:42:29] ministers have
[1:42:31] they talk about it in the backyard so to
[1:42:34] speak
[1:42:38] and I just had you know I'm on a group
[1:42:41] chat but I I told him man I just want to
[1:42:43] say I appreciate every one of you
[1:42:49] because it seemed like you know
[1:42:53] you're getting people getting you know
[1:42:54] especially minutes to get discouraged
[1:42:56] and doesn't look like they're doing
[1:42:57] anything and
[1:43:02] I was telling them I said you realize
[1:43:04] how Satan would love to denominate the
[1:43:08] people again
[1:43:09] hold him in bondage
[1:43:11] like he's done in for years and years
[1:43:14] and years but it's because of the
[1:43:15] ministry
[1:43:16] I just believe that
[1:43:18] because of the ministry that believe
[1:43:21] this message that even though there may
[1:43:24] be disagreements and there may be things
[1:43:26] that we all don't see eye to eye on
[1:43:28] we're still willing to put our arms
[1:43:30] around each other and call each other
[1:43:32] brother
[1:43:33] we're still willing to to say let's
[1:43:37] fight let's go
[1:43:39] let's do this thing
[1:43:42] hello
[1:43:44] and so I I appreciate them
[1:43:47] very much because it shows that we're
[1:43:49] back to seed again
[1:43:52] we are the seed everybody say we are the
[1:43:54] seed
[1:43:56] this this has a real meaning and and I'm
[1:43:59] hoping to get more into that
[1:44:01] because brother REM says you know tells
[1:44:04] us that everything is pulled away
[1:44:06] everything has pulled away and the seed
[1:44:10] is ripening in the presence of the Sun
[1:44:13] with that thought there is no time like
[1:44:17] now
[1:44:18] no greater time
[1:44:20] than to show Hebrews 13 8 to the world
[1:44:24] that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday
[1:44:27] today and forever
[1:44:31] one little ounce of unbelief one little
[1:44:35] ounce of whatever it kills it
[1:44:37] but a people on the Earth today
[1:44:41] is back to the original seed we've been
[1:44:44] cut away from all denominations and all
[1:44:47] Creeds and all all isms
[1:44:50] to where we can just accept the word for
[1:44:52] what it is
[1:44:54] whether we understand it or not we just
[1:44:56] say Amen to it if God said it I believe
[1:44:59] it that settles it
[1:45:01] can you say amen and the life of God is
[1:45:05] able to flow in the seed again
[1:45:08] all the life that is gathered brother
[1:45:11] Brown said that all the life is gathered
[1:45:13] in the seed again all the life of God is
[1:45:16] gathered in the seed again
[1:45:18] Anything is Possible
[1:45:21] can you say Amen we're not just in the
[1:45:24] days of Jesus that brother Brown said
[1:45:26] he's Jesus had a greater success in my
[1:45:28] Ministry than he did his own why this is
[1:45:31] the greater time for him it's a greater
[1:45:34] age it's a more evil age and it requires
[1:45:37] a more greater work
[1:45:41] do you believe that and where is he
[1:45:44] doing it just in a prophet absolutely
[1:45:46] not he's done it in a mini member body
[1:45:49] that's been cut away from all the isms
[1:45:52] and Creeds and denominations to where
[1:45:55] they're standing and the shuck has
[1:45:56] pulled away the Pentecostal shuck the
[1:45:58] denominations and all this has pulled
[1:46:00] away and yes we're standing alone
[1:46:04] but thank God for it because he's with
[1:46:06] us
[1:46:07] he's in US
[1:46:09] can you say Amen
[1:46:11] I think of it here we're called to show
[1:46:14] that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday
[1:46:16] today and forever
[1:46:18] and yet God would choose us as mortal
[1:46:21] beings not super men women boys girls
[1:46:24] but just mortal human beings
[1:46:29] and he chooses us to show that he cannot
[1:46:31] change
[1:46:32] and yet we change
[1:46:36] we don't know what will happen in five
[1:46:39] minutes from now
[1:46:41] we are healthy today but could be sick
[1:46:43] tomorrow
[1:46:46] we could be on the Mountaintop today and
[1:46:48] be in the valley a week from now
[1:46:50] right
[1:46:52] we could be happy today
[1:46:56] nothing there to bother us
[1:47:00] and in 30 minutes now a tragedy hits our
[1:47:02] lives that turns our world upside down
[1:47:07] we never know
[1:47:09] we don't know the future we don't know
[1:47:11] all these things and yet God has called
[1:47:13] us
[1:47:15] to show the world that he is the same
[1:47:19] yesterday today and forever
[1:47:22] what a paradox
[1:47:24] and all the ups and downs that you go
[1:47:26] through does not change that fight that
[1:47:29] he is the same
[1:47:31] right
[1:47:34] so he chose us to be his body
[1:47:37] and he chose us so that his own life his
[1:47:40] own life can throw flow through us
[1:47:43] and if it doesn't then we're dead
[1:47:47] if the life would ever leave my body
[1:47:50] then I won't be able to talk I won't be
[1:47:52] able to see this body just lays there
[1:47:54] dormant
[1:47:56] and all the things that it used to do
[1:47:57] can't do it no more because the life is
[1:47:59] gone
[1:48:01] right
[1:48:03] I won't be able to hear you won't be
[1:48:05] able to see you wouldn't be able to
[1:48:06] communicate wouldn't be able to express
[1:48:08] the nature
[1:48:09] I wouldn't
[1:48:11] you'd say well where did Sean go
[1:48:16] you put the body in the ground but the
[1:48:19] light's gone
[1:48:21] right yes
[1:48:23] well that's the same way God wants to be
[1:48:26] known to be alive
[1:48:30] he wants to be aware he wants people to
[1:48:33] recognize that he's alive
[1:48:36] so he's got a body here on Earth that he
[1:48:38] puts his own life in and it quickens
[1:48:44] praise the Lord
[1:48:45] come on you see things different because
[1:48:48] it's his eyes now
[1:48:50] you see things different because it's
[1:48:52] his mouth now
[1:48:54] right yeah you as a carnal Man live in
[1:48:58] there but he's also living in there
[1:49:03] you hear things different because it's
[1:49:04] his ears
[1:49:07] you're quickened
[1:49:09] they got old dead corpse and bring life
[1:49:11] back in that it'll wake it'll move
[1:49:14] right
[1:49:16] well that's the same way the church has
[1:49:18] been dead and dead and dead
[1:49:20] but in this age that quickening life has
[1:49:22] come
[1:49:24] to Quicken us
[1:49:27] you believe it
[1:49:29] yes sir then if it's his life then what
[1:49:32] are we Messiah
[1:49:34] Messiah the anointed one
[1:49:37] ain't that right
[1:49:39] the last Commission because we're an
[1:49:41] honor to the word and the last
[1:49:43] commission Jesus said gave the church
[1:49:45] March 16 15 and said unto them go ye
[1:49:48] into all the world and preach the gospel
[1:49:49] to Every Creature he that believer then
[1:49:52] is baptized shall be saved but he that
[1:49:54] believeth not shall be damned and these
[1:49:57] signs shall follow them that believe in
[1:49:59] my name they shall cast out Devils they
[1:50:01] shall speak with new tongues they shall
[1:50:03] take up serpents and if they drink any
[1:50:05] deadly thing it shall not hurt them they
[1:50:07] shall lay hands on the sick and they
[1:50:09] shall recover do you believe that that
[1:50:13] scripture was not only for the first
[1:50:14] church that is for our day too
[1:50:19] Hallelujah and do you know what if every
[1:50:22] one of us boys and girls
[1:50:27] men and women
[1:50:29] if we've got that quickening power it
[1:50:31] quickens us to that scripture
[1:50:34] you young people don't have to say well
[1:50:36] well I I got to be a certain age no you
[1:50:38] can pray
[1:50:40] in which God do something
[1:50:43] ain't that right I remember my my first
[1:50:46] wife 10 years old
[1:50:48] just you know a Christian young
[1:50:51] Christian in the Lord and but she was
[1:50:53] excited about about God and and you know
[1:50:56] uh she used to play basketball and you
[1:50:59] know and and
[1:51:01] things and she told her mom says Mom I'm
[1:51:04] not doing that no more I'm not wearing
[1:51:06] shorts and things I'm
[1:51:07] I'm going to be a Christian you know of
[1:51:10] course her mom about had a cow and and
[1:51:14] uh but she said I'm I'm going to serve
[1:51:17] the Lord and so her you know people the
[1:51:21] children
[1:51:22] was was really persecuted or a lot made
[1:51:25] fun of her and things at school but
[1:51:27] didn't matter she's just going to serve
[1:51:28] the Lord
[1:51:29] and one of her chief persecutors
[1:51:32] came to her one day and says Rebecca
[1:51:34] I've known I know I've given you a hard
[1:51:36] time about
[1:51:37] you know the way you've been and you
[1:51:40] live and things but she said I've seen
[1:51:43] something real about you
[1:51:45] and she said you know I'm sorry for for
[1:51:47] giving you a hard time but
[1:51:50] she says I've got cancer
[1:51:52] and she said you know
[1:51:57] I just want to know if you'd pray for me
[1:52:01] remember said yeah I'll pray for you so
[1:52:03] right there in the school
[1:52:05] she laid hands on that girl and she
[1:52:07] prayed for
[1:52:08] now I don't know if she was 10 or a
[1:52:10] little older
[1:52:11] but at that time when that happened but
[1:52:14] it's prayed for and
[1:52:16] after a while I think it was six months
[1:52:19] or so after that that girl comes smiling
[1:52:21] she said Rebecca I've just been declared
[1:52:24] cancer free
[1:52:27] uh didn't even have to take chemo
[1:52:30] nothing just God touched me
[1:52:33] but that was that was a little girl
[1:52:36] that recognized who she was
[1:52:40] and that can happen to any of us here
[1:52:42] today see you're quick and do the word
[1:52:44] it's not by age it's it's by experience
[1:52:47] can you say man
[1:52:49] and and so we find and I'm I'm going to
[1:52:52] close if the musicians come
[1:52:55] but
[1:52:57] someone in question answers please
[1:52:59] explain he said people are saying
[1:53:01] brother Branham is more than a man he
[1:53:03] can create and Jesus can look just like
[1:53:06] brother Branham
[1:53:09] he said brother Graham replies this
[1:53:11] person said this he said whoever it
[1:53:13] might be I don't know but I am your
[1:53:15] brother Jesus is your savior I cannot be
[1:53:18] your savior for he has already saved you
[1:53:20] now you're so close to being the truth
[1:53:25] there and yet so far from the truth the
[1:53:29] person that told this person is
[1:53:31] now he goes on to talking later down he
[1:53:35] said now remember we are not the word
[1:53:38] but we are the word
[1:53:42] uh-huh now You Gotta See Jesus was not
[1:53:45] God but he was God he was a man yet he
[1:53:48] was God
[1:53:49] he could cry and yet he could raise the
[1:53:51] dead he could cry for a man being dead
[1:53:53] and raise him back again he was Jehovah
[1:53:56] Jireh Jehovah Rapha Jehovah Nissa
[1:53:59] he was Jehovah all completely he was
[1:54:01] Jehovah and yet he was a man
[1:54:03] he on the earth made the Earth and yet
[1:54:06] had not a place to lay his head
[1:54:08] he said the birds that I made got nest
[1:54:11] and I haven't got a place to lay my head
[1:54:12] the foxes that I've created has hoes in
[1:54:14] the ground and I haven't got one myself
[1:54:16] to even to be buried in that's right he
[1:54:19] had to borrow somebody's grave to be
[1:54:21] buried in he created a womb that was in
[1:54:24] a woman and he had no womb to be born in
[1:54:26] he had to borrow a wound
[1:54:28] he craved the Earth and he had not a
[1:54:30] place to be buried in he had he had to
[1:54:32] borrow a hole in the ground to be buried
[1:54:34] in Joseph see and they had to borrow a
[1:54:38] place and yet he was God and prove that
[1:54:40] he was God you know you understand see
[1:54:42] we are Messiahs but not that Jesus
[1:54:46] he is our father we're just an owner
[1:54:48] with this spirit and that's the reason
[1:54:50] his life and that gets people
[1:54:53] if you don't sit and think it through it
[1:54:56] gets you know people to believe well
[1:54:58] this guy would be the Messiah sure he is
[1:55:01] this one over here could be they both
[1:55:04] are well how can that be two of them
[1:55:06] there's thousands of them but see you
[1:55:09] see his life is separated on the day of
[1:55:12] Pentecost and when that Pillar of Fire
[1:55:13] came down it separated like tongues and
[1:55:16] set up on each of them God dividing
[1:55:18] himself among his people because the
[1:55:21] church and Christ is one
[1:55:24] just as husband and wife is one
[1:55:28] ain't that right now I like this as we
[1:55:32] close but he said this he said now this
[1:55:35] person that's in you which is your birth
[1:55:37] you are John Dole you were born in a
[1:55:39] certain month you were born under a
[1:55:42] certain star you were born under a
[1:55:43] certain thing and that something that
[1:55:46] has something to do with you as a
[1:55:48] natural
[1:55:50] certainly does he said that's your birth
[1:55:53] path
[1:55:54] that's what you are a natural man a
[1:55:56] natural woman
[1:55:59] but when you're reborn again
[1:56:02] see see that's not the outside
[1:56:05] conscience the outside is what you see
[1:56:08] taste feel smell and hear but the inside
[1:56:10] of that is what you really are
[1:56:13] now this out here this old flesh Satan
[1:56:16] just tempts you and knocks you around
[1:56:19] every way here
[1:56:21] but down in here he can't do that
[1:56:24] [Applause]
[1:56:25] unless you let him do it
[1:56:29] right so how many goes through seasons
[1:56:32] in your life boy I go through him
[1:56:35] foreign
[1:56:36] go to bed happy wake up the next day I'm
[1:56:39] wondering what happened
[1:56:41] something tonight happened
[1:56:42] [Music]
[1:56:45] it could be a rainy day just dreary and
[1:56:47] it affects you
[1:56:49] all these things and Satan takes
[1:56:51] advantages of these things
[1:56:55] but that's only the outside but that
[1:56:57] inside he can never ever touch you
[1:57:01] aren't you glad for that
[1:57:02] [Music]
[1:57:04] and and and the Pentecostal
[1:57:07] age the Pentecostals
[1:57:11] they they always went for Sensations and
[1:57:14] emotions and
[1:57:17] feelings they had to feel good and if
[1:57:20] they didn't
[1:57:20] [Music]
[1:57:22] man just get out of their way
[1:57:25] [Music]
[1:57:27] they you know I mean and and
[1:57:30] I'll be honest
[1:57:32] and I I feel like that's how the
[1:57:35] preachers were able to control the
[1:57:36] people
[1:57:38] they get them to the Altar and them same
[1:57:39] people would be at the altar every time
[1:57:41] seek him for the Holy Ghost
[1:57:44] something that they once had and they
[1:57:46] lost it
[1:57:48] but we found out that if you ever get
[1:57:50] the Holy Ghost you can never lose it
[1:57:52] it'll never happen
[1:57:54] so then we find out that there there is
[1:57:57] a natural person that's us that natural
[1:58:00] person that Satan can mess with any time
[1:58:04] and when I say that he messed with our
[1:58:06] feelings he messes with our passions he
[1:58:08] messes with our emotions
[1:58:11] he messes with our memory
[1:58:15] I'm sure you've had it you've had maybe
[1:58:17] a terrible experience in your past and
[1:58:19] you could be just doing great and then
[1:58:21] somehow something triggers your memory
[1:58:24] to where you start dwelling on that
[1:58:28] before you know it
[1:58:30] you're not careful
[1:58:31] you'll lose your song
[1:58:34] you'll get down in the dumps all because
[1:58:37] of that memory
[1:58:40] but that's your natural
[1:58:43] that's just a natural side but inside
[1:58:47] see that's what you really are he said
[1:58:49] now this out here Satan just Tims you
[1:58:51] and knocks you around every way here but
[1:58:54] down here he can't do it unless you let
[1:58:57] him do it for in here you've got faith
[1:59:00] and Faith don't come come from the outer
[1:59:04] conscience and it reasons but in faith
[1:59:06] there is no reasons you got it from God
[1:59:11] aren't you glad for that you got it from
[1:59:14] God and you know it's there how many
[1:59:17] knows this there
[1:59:19] now look at it he says I don't care how
[1:59:21] much it looks wrong you still know it's
[1:59:25] right
[1:59:26] it's thus saith the Lord and there's
[1:59:28] nothing going to bother that nothing can
[1:59:30] bother that it's moving right straight
[1:59:33] on difficult means nothing to it wage
[1:59:35] right on through it for it's the word
[1:59:38] and the words The Sword and the word
[1:59:40] cuts the word Cuts itself free from
[1:59:43] everything else
[1:59:45] you're the body you're the body of Jesus
[1:59:47] Christ oh do you love him
[1:59:51] I'm so glad for our lord Jesus what song
