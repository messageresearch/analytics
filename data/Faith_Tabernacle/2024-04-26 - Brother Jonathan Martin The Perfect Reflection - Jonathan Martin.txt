with people that are on their way to heaven and they've made their Journey lighter and getting lighter all the time amen we're under great expectation for God to come for us amen and uh you can be seated for just a few moments I I want to welcome just everyone uh that has come in today and um uh certainly appreciate all of you that have uh made the effort to come and to be part of our meeting and uh we've just uh really been excited to have you and uh looking forward to a wonderful time in the Lord and um you know there's something about when Believers get together they they just expect and um you know I I believe that's what we're going to have this uh this week amen is not just a gathering of human beings it's uh deity God coming Among Us and um he has met with us throughout the years and and uh here and um you know we had uh just I'd heard a and last year I believe it was and the Lord healed her of a eating disorder and uh she's I believe telling brother Andrew she said now I can eat my Chick-fil-A without throwing up and uh you know that's just the way God is he he there's nothing too hard for our Lord nothing and as Believers we just throws at us there's nothing impossible to them that believe ain't that right you know um the prophet said every man that's born of the spirit of God will have to believe in the Supernatural because he is a part of God and he is an offspring of God ain't that right and we're not and uh I I I I love the the brothers that are preaching and they've got tremendous Ministries great gifts that God has placed in their life amen but more than anything we're here to see God God to come and and move among H us and you know uh we see the value of coming together and putting our licks of fire uh uh together and uh we we've come under a promise that Jesus gave us that where two or three are gathered in my name there will I be in their midst and I believe God is here do you believe that not only have we been in under expectation but God has been under expectation I truly believe that I believe that these meetings are ordained of God before the foundation of the world and he ordained it for this week this time and says I will be there I will be there every service and and uh you know uh we we uh we we've had a lot of rain a lot of wind and it's been really cold and uh but we we set up the date to set this tin up and we knew we could put up with the cold but the rain and the wind we just and that day that uh we decided to do this and the day come God gave us perfect weather no rain no wind beautiful and uh that may be something small to you but it was something significant to me and it stood the test amen and here we are tonight and uh so I I I certainly love the Lord and uh the Bible talks of uh King uh joab when he had heard of the Prophet Elisha uh that was sick and he had went to visit him and the prophet uh brother bradam says when he went to visit him he didn't come irreverent but he come with respect he walked up so he had enough God about him to know that he must visit this Prophet with respect and he said that's the way you want to get something from God don't come around a meeting like this to make fun don't come around to pack some kind of a tail from one place to another he said if you do that you'll never get nowhere with God he said don't read the Bible to fuss about it read the Bible to live it he said that's right he said and when he went down there he seen him and he respected him and he said my father my father the Chariots of Israel and the horse he said in other words my father you're worth more than all the Chariots of Israel and all the horsemen thereof he said how true that is I say tonight that though Elijah was considered a Holy Roller and a fanatic by the modern world yet his presence in that nation was worth more than all the horses and the Chariots profit our way did you enjoy the service last night wow and we we got a got off to a great start uh last night and and uh uh way I believe it it was pure message what we heard last night and everything that brother Brandon preached about adoption uh we heard it last night things that brother Brandon taught about the third pull and Perfection we heard it last night and I can truly believe with all of my heart that God was pleased amen and uh it's something that I could say Amen 1,000% to it amen do you love of the Lord now we're we're uh looking forward to brother Jonathan coming and ministering to us tonight and uh uh brother Jonathan is is not only uh my natural brother but a brother in the Lord and I highly respect him and uh just his ministry his love for the message love for the people and um and and um we could just sing the song only believe all things are possible amen and I'm just a

Christ and the power of his resurrection and uh it's so good to be here and such an honor uh to be able to uh be here at the camp meeting again and and great privilege to uh be able to minister the word to uh the Bride of the Lord Jesus Christ and you're so precious in God's sight the purchased of his blood and and uh we just uh had a tremendous time last night in the word and we so uh appre uh so glad to be able to recate uh uh we got different folks uh Home Folks from uh Bible to see different ones just say God richly bless you good to have them here with us and and uh just always good to be here with brother Shawn and uh Faith Tabernacle as well and so if you have your Bibles we uh will turn to uh few different scriptures John the 14th chapter and we'll just begin at verse uh 6 and we'll read down to the 13th verse and then we'll turn over a chapter to John 15 and then a very familiar uh uh scripture to us we'll read Luke 17:30 John 14 and verse 6 Jesus saith unto him I am the way the truth and the life no man cometh unto the father but by me if ye had known me ye should have known my father also and from him unto him Lord show us the father and it sufficeth us Jesus saith unto him have I been so long time with you and yet hast thou not known me philli he that hath seen me hath seen the father and how sayest thou then and the father in me the words that I speak unto you I speak not of myself but the father that dwelleth in me he doeth The Works believe me that I am in the father and the father in me or else believe me for the very Works sake The Works that I do shall he do also and Greater Works than these shall he do because I go unto my father and whatsoever you shall ask in my name that will I do that the the father may be glorified in the son now St John I am the vine ye are the branches he that abideth in me and I in him the same bringeth forth much fruit for without me ye can do nothing if a man abide not in me he is cast forth as a branch and is withered and Men gather them and cast them Into the Fire and they are burned if ye abide in me and my words abide in you you shall ask what you will and it shall be done unto you herein is my father glorified that ye bear much fruit so shall ye be my disciples now Luke 17:30 even thus shall it be in the day when the son of man is revealed now if we could just bow our heads for a word of prayer and maybe you've brought uh a need a request on your heart why don't you just lift that up before the throne of grace and I know that God sees it God hears the heart's cry father Lord we come before you as your children Lord Sons and Daughters of the Living God God and Lord we just ask that you would move by your spirit Among Us hide us beneath your blood Lord I pray that you would just discern every heart and every life and I pray that you would Minister to the in such a wave of the supernatural Holy Spirit and just touch every heart and life oh God lord move us out of the way and I pray father that you would anoint the word and Lord let it just hit the mark we ask in the name of Jesus Christ amen and amen God bless you you can be seated uh I would like to uh just take for a uh text uh the perfect reflection and uh we know that according to Ephesians uh this the first chapter uh that Paul said said that this is the dispensation of the fullness of time that he might gather together in one all things in Christ now uh the the prophet of God in adoption uh part three when he was reading this the this is the dispensation of the fullness of time he says now this is now is the dispensation of adoption read Ephesians uh the first chapter and uh brother Wayne just brought these things out so beautiful and we just pray that we can build upon uh what he was speaking on but Ephesians the first chapter uh the 7th to the 9th verse it says in whom to The Riches of his grace wherein he hath abounded toward us in all wisdom and Prudence having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself now the prophet of God is reading this and he comes to this and he says having made known unto us the mystery of his will to adopt us and he would say he purposed this himself before the the foundation of the world how many understands it amen so the mystery of his will is to adopt us now what we have received in this hour in this age or this dispensation of adoption is a message of adoption how many believes that amen as the prophet of God would say in recognizing your day and its message he would say the spirit of God which is the word of God my word is spirit and life will put the bride in her place she'll recognize her position in the word and you see H you know Satan has done everything he can to put fear surrounding the promises of God Amen to get us to looking at our our flaws and we looked at ourselves uh we would see flawed human beings amen but we heard last night amen that Perfection comes by the perfect sacrifice of the Lamb amen it is the blood of Jesus Christ that perfects us that makes us holy that fulfills the very commandment of God be ye therefore perfect even as Our Father which is in heaven is perfect amen but you see Satan is always trying to bring a fear a fear of failure amen a fear of mistakes and past mistakes and future mistakes and what if I believe this what if I confess this and begin to identify with this message and actually say that this is who I am and this is what the message has identified that I am what what if I fall short of the glory of God well let's just go go ahead and declare that All Flesh has fallen short of the glory of God Amen but that is not where our Perfection lies our Perfection lies in the finished work of Calvary that when the Lamb of God which was taking your place was nailed on Calvary and he cried it is finished he forever settled the sin question you are not guilty you are no longer it is no longer held against you it is no longer held against your charge but you are the perfect sinless uh Justified Bride of the Lord Jesus Christ we're not preaching a Luther's message uh we are not preaching uh a message of a closed book uh we are preaching a message through the revealing of the son of man that you are the blood bought you are the redeemed you never sinned the first place uh I didn't say it he said it uh he Vindicated Calvary he proclaimed the good news uh that because I live you live also he's not dead uh he's alive uh and this message is not a dead Christ uh it's a living resurrected Christ uh that is waving the good news uh over a people that is predestinated to the adoption of sons come to your position come to your identity of who you are oh how Satan hates it though you see he'll he'll he'll He he'll keep barking amen he'll keep talking he'll keep Whispering all of his lies amen he'll keep telling you you're not able you're not worthy it's not for you amen but just see the prophet of God actually would say I have found the weak spot of Pentecostal people by God's help now this is a prophet amen this this is a prophet that is Discerning the problem of the Pentecostal people and he says I have found the weak spot by God's help that is your scared that's right that's true you're just scared to take God God at his word and you don't know who you are if you only realize what position you are in heaven tonight there would be something take place here well I just simply believe uh that there is a people under their message is coming to their place uh and they realize who they are and there is something that can take place I tell you there's something greater amen than just being the blind eyes being open there's something even greater than just a shout or an emotional service but there's a people that are manifesting the word manifesting the very thoughts of God Amen momies and daddies families uh that are coming under the headship of Christ uh realizing there's something here that can take place something here that is bringing a rise in faith it's all that is taking place in this age accumulating in our hearts and we are in the Rapture something taking place you see I believe the message has so dealt with the fear and scare that Satan has put on the church to utterly conquer and subdue fear you see he did it by revealing who you are that you're not going to be but now say with me now I am the sons of God you see Ephesians the 1 chapter the 4th verse says according as he had chosen Us in him before to the foundation of the world that we now the prophet of God would let us know amen that a good day is not a sign of God's approval neither a bad day is a sign of God's disapproval but we but what we've got to know is God's love is elective love and we know he loved us because he it is God that justifies and nothing can say separate us from the love of God again God's love is election when did God choose you before you made one mistake when you ever had a good day or a bad day before you had he predestinated you to be conformed to the image of his son the word Christ uh and there is nothing that is going to separate that purpose God has swore by an oath that he's going to have the bride in the last days uh that is spotless white uh that is going to come under the reflection of the son of man the word for this day to Manifest this portion of the word absolutely Romans 8:30 moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called and Lumi called them he also Justified and whom he justified them he also glorified the prophet of God would say notice this is an unconditional Covenant this has nothing to do with you this has nothing to do amen well if you do this I'll do this and well I've got to you know I feel good and I feel like a Christian so I'm I must be glorified amen or well you wake up tomorrow and you're in a bad you're having a bad day well I must not be called I must not be glorified the prophet of God said this is an unconditional Covenant he swore by himself amen hallelujah the prophet of God says God has already glorified his church those who he justified he also glorified in the church in Christ if you're justified in Christ you're glorified in Christ already as far as God is concerned aren't you glad to know what how God's concerned with you amen Jesus said there and Jesus said be therefore perfect even as your father in Heaven is perfect how could you ever be perfect but in the sight of Christ tonight every born again Christian is perfect I'm just as perfect in God as Christ was you are too every other believer it's not my Holiness is his Holiness God cannot accept mine I have none but
