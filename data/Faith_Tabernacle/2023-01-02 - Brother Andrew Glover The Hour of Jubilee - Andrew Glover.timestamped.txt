[48:09] seven years and the space of the seven
[48:12] sabbaths of years shall be unto thee 40
[48:14] and nine years then shalt thou cause the

[48:36] shall be a jubilee unto you and ye shall

[49:01] the Year of Jubilee you shall return
[49:03] turn somebody say return
[49:06] you shall return every man unto his
[49:08] possession I also want to read in the
[49:10] Book of Luke the fourth chapter
[49:13] The Book of Luke the fourth chapter you
[49:15] know that Leviticus 25 is brother
[49:17] Graham's text for a sermon called return
[49:20] in Jubilee and in the Book of Luke we
[49:23] want to look in the fourth chapter
[49:26] we thank the Lord for the prophet of God
[49:28] Amen we're not reading the word under a
[49:30] theologian but we're reading the word
[49:32] under a Vindicated voice amen Luke the
[49:35] fourth chapter and in the 16th verse
[49:38] Jesus has just come into the temple and
[49:42] he came to Nazareth where he had been
[49:43] brought up and as his custom was he went
[49:45] to the synagogue on the Sabbath day
[49:47] and stood up for to read and there was
[49:50] delivered unto him the book of the
[49:51] prophet Isaiah and when he had opened
[49:54] the book he found the place where it was
[49:56] written now we know that that was Isaiah
[49:58] 61 right he found the place where it was
[50:00] written and the spirit of the Lord is
[50:03] upon me because he hath anointed me to
[50:06] preach the gospel to the poor he has
[50:08] sent me to heal the brokenhearted to
[50:10] preach Deliverance to the captive the
[50:12] Covenant of sight to the blind to set at
[50:15] Liberty them that are bruised and to
[50:18] preach the acceptable year of the Lord
[50:21] he closed the book and gave it to the
[50:24] minister and sat down and the eyes of
[50:27] all them that were in the synagogue were
[50:28] fastened on him and he began to say unto
[50:31] them this day is this scripture
[50:34] fulfilled in your ears this day is the
[50:38] scripture fulfilled in your ears can I
[50:40] say it like this he began to Proclaim
[50:42] this day this scripture is fulfilled in
[50:46] your ears one of the place I want to
[50:48] read just one verse is John the eighth
[50:50] chapter
[50:51] I pray you all forgive me for so many
[50:53] scriptures tonight but I pray the Lord
[50:54] will help us to tie these thoughts
[50:56] together just something on our heart in
[50:59] John the eighth chapter
[51:01] and the 36th verse
[51:04] the Bible says
[51:05] if the son therefore shall make you free
[51:09] you shall be free
[51:11] indeed
[51:13] if the son therefore
[51:15] make you free ye shall be free indeed we
[51:19] ask Lord this evening to bless the
[51:20] reading of his word as you can have your
[51:22] seats here this afternoon I want to by
[51:24] the help of the Lord for just a few
[51:26] moments tonight if I title this sermon I
[51:28] want to speak to you on the hour of
[51:31] Jubilee the hour of Jubilee brother Bram
[51:34] says in a message he calls it actually
[51:36] he preaches three messages if you get
[51:38] time to listen to him very powerful
[51:40] sermons I find if you listen to them
[51:42] back to back in 1956 he'll preach
[51:44] azusa's Jubilee then he preaches return
[51:47] in Jubilee and then he preaches this day
[51:50] is the scripture fulfilled and in the
[51:52] message returned in Jubilee He said now
[51:54] is the hour of Jubilee come back to your
[51:57] original inheritance to a real Holy
[52:00] Ghost again amen I I really I believe if
[52:03] that's why that our pastor here has had
[52:05] these burdens upon his heart to have
[52:06] these meetings this weekend not just for
[52:09] a protractive meeting or not just to
[52:11] show up and see who's here or who's not
[52:13] here amen but that sons and daughters of
[52:16] God could return back Amen to their
[52:18] original inheritance to a real Holy
[52:21] Ghost again now that uh title there is
[52:24] return and Jubilee let's say that
[52:26] together return and Jubilee if you look
[52:29] at the word return it means to bring
[52:31] back it means to allow to return it
[52:33] means to put back it means to draw back
[52:36] it means to give back it means to
[52:38] restore it means to relinquish one's
[52:40] rights given in payment Amen to bring
[52:43] back to refresh to restore so in other
[52:46] words it's not something that you're
[52:48] actually working to do but it's actually
[52:50] something drawing you back to itself
[52:52] it's actually pulling you amen it's
[52:54] actually forcing whatever has laid claim
[52:57] upon you to turn loose of it that you
[52:59] could return back to your original
[53:01] inheritance the words you believe there
[53:03] means a special anniversary of an event
[53:06] it is especially one celebrating amen 25
[53:10] or 50 years of a rain or activity now
[53:12] we're not here tonight celebrating 25
[53:15] years of Ministry or 25 years of a
[53:18] church or 50 years of a church we're
[53:20] here tonight amen rejoicing in the
[53:22] opening of the word which was the
[53:25] Jubilee to the bride remember said
[53:27] Jubilee was God's manner of expressing
[53:29] Grace to his people amen for restoring
[53:32] or to be brought back and to their
[53:34] rightful position he says now I believe
[53:37] that this is the hour again of Jubilee
[53:40] amen I believe that it's time to Jubilee
[53:43] amen I believe that it's the time of
[53:45] Jubilee listen we are not here tonight
[53:48] Desiring amen amen a better or a better
[53:51] uh how I say this a better idea amen we
[53:53] are here Desiring the revelation of the
[53:56] word amen to move into the Flesh of the
[53:59] church to actually cause them amen to
[54:01] return back to where they come from let
[54:03] me just say it to you like this you did
[54:05] not come from Leo to see him you did not
[54:07] come from this world therefore you
[54:09] cannot stay here amen you came from a
[54:12] place called eternity you you came from
[54:14] a place where there was no sin there was
[54:16] no unbelief there was no devil amen and
[54:19] time has laid a hold of you amen time is
[54:22] proclaims upon you amen but before time
[54:25] ever put claims upon you amen there was
[54:27] a gene seed inside of your soul amen
[54:30] that claimed you before Humanity let me
[54:32] set you like this amen deity claimed you
[54:34] before Humanity ever got a hold of you
[54:37] and there's something inside of you that
[54:39] is drawing you back to where you come
[54:40] from what are you saying I'm saying amen
[54:43] the same God that sent Jubilee in the
[54:45] days before is the same God who sins
[54:48] Jubilee today I don't believe it's time
[54:50] to be depressed I don't believe it's
[54:52] time to be discouraged I don't believe
[54:54] amen it's time to come to a message
[54:56] church and sit there with our Spirits
[54:58] all tore up and all watted up amen at
[55:01] first ever been a time to be rejoicing
[55:03] in the Liberty we're with Christ has
[55:05] made us free amen this is the hour this
[55:08] is the time this is the season amen when
[55:10] God is sent you believe remember him
[55:12] said the devil has come in and taken
[55:14] many Believers captive during this time
[55:16] amen for instance coldness and
[55:18] worldliness has slipped into the church
[55:20] amen but the thing we're here for today
[55:22] is in celebration of the old-fashioned
[55:25] Holy Ghost Revival that we used to have
[55:27] he said I hear our fathers talk about it
[55:29] how the Angels came down and they sang
[55:31] in the meetings listen and the power of
[55:34] God taken over amen they sang in the
[55:36] meetings and the angels came down and
[55:39] the power of God taken over and the
[55:42] Saints were born again amen and great
[55:44] things happen listen amen we did not
[55:46] come here to see who's here and who's
[55:48] not here this week we did not come here
[55:51] Amen to serpent ideas among preachers
[55:53] but we have come here for one purpose
[55:55] and one motive and one objective and
[55:57] that is to get lost in the spirit of God
[55:59] to the Holy Ghost comes in the church
[56:01] and does things that Andrew Glover amen
[56:04] does things that Wayne Lawson knows
[56:06] nothing about a known Church we're not
[56:08] here for just another meeting we are
[56:10] here for a jubilee we are here to
[56:12] rejoice in the Liberty we are here I'm
[56:15] not going to worry about teaching I'm
[56:16] just gonna preach right now amen we're
[56:18] here to get free of all these tied down
[56:20] Traditions we're here to get free of all
[56:22] these ill feelings and bad attitudes and
[56:25] so and so did this and so amen when are
[56:27] we going to let it go amen and move
[56:29] forward in the Liberty we're with Christ
[56:31] has made us free we are not a bunch of
[56:34] chickenized hotbed hybrid plants we are
[56:36] Sons and Daughters of God we are eagles
[56:39] that has been born by the genes of God
[56:41] we have not been born from time we have
[56:44] been born from eternity and eternity's
[56:46] got a claim on you amen God is going to
[56:49] claim on you you can't stay in that
[56:51] depressed condition because depression
[56:53] ain't in eternity you can't stay in that
[56:56] bitter condition because bitterness is
[56:58] not in eternity but I'll tell you what
[57:00] is in eternity it's joy unspeakable and
[57:03] full of Glory I tell you what is an
[57:06] eternity is the angels of God moving
[57:08] among the people I think it's time to
[57:10] let the power of God take over I think
[57:12] it's time to come back the prophecy LED
[57:15] an old-fashioned backwards sky blue sin
[57:17] killing amen preaching the old sassafras
[57:20] type
[57:21] yeah maybe maybe men didn't know their
[57:24] ABCs but they know Christ and they had
[57:26] the baptism of the Holy Ghost that's
[57:28] what we hunger for today is an
[57:30] old-fashioned baptism of the Holy Ghost
[57:33] and a pouring out of God's blessings he
[57:36] said oh I feel today let in my soul to
[57:38] make this proposition with the people I
[57:40] believe if every one of us in this
[57:42] building today will rededicate our lives
[57:45] to God Amen as Jacob was told by the
[57:47] Lord amen to wash up his and get his
[57:50] people clean amen up to present
[57:52] themselves before the Lord I believe it
[57:54] for clean up ourselves from all of our
[57:57] evil thinking from all of our
[57:58] selfishness from all of our backbiting
[58:01] from all of her acts of this life and
[58:03] come boldly Before the Throne of God I
[58:05] believe in old-fashioned Revival will
[58:07] break out here in Angela's Temple that
[58:10] one week will never stop it let me say
[58:12] this friends I'm going to replace
[58:13] Angela's Temple amen with Faith
[58:16] Tabernacle I believe it for clean up if
[58:18] we'll get rid of her back button and
[58:20] we'll get rid of our grudges Center get
[58:22] rid of our disagreements amen the Holy
[58:24] Ghost shall Break Free in this church
[58:26] amen that one week will contain it amen
[58:29] a mouthful contain it I'm not talking
[58:31] about a man-made Revival I'm talking
[58:33] about a word Revival breaking out in the
[58:36] church until men get clean and women get
[58:39] clean and young people get clean and
[58:42] preachers get clean listen you may think
[58:44] I've lost my mind I have and you say who
[58:46] you after right after the devil tonight
[58:48] I think it's time to break loose I think
[58:51] it's time to spread our wings and let a
[58:53] Revival break out in the church
[58:56] we don't need a new church to have
[58:58] Revival we need a Revival in the church
[59:00] we got we don't need new programs to
[59:02] bring a Revival we need a rededication
[59:04] and a re-out point of the Holy Ghost
[59:07] that will bring a Revival in the Church
[59:09] of the Living God you say brother Andrew
[59:11] this is just a weak meeting don't you
[59:13] let some lukewarm lay out a sin careful
[59:16] amen numb down the potentials that's
[59:18] inside of this meeting
[59:21] they say well ain't much can happen amen
[59:24] maybe if you've got a natural God there
[59:26] ain't much can happen but I'm talking
[59:28] about a supernatural God I'm talking
[59:30] about a God who is the identified Christ
[59:33] of all ages then what are you saying I'm
[59:35] saying the potentials of this meeting
[59:38] are Supernatural
[59:40] the potentials of every one of these
[59:43] services are Supernatural they're
[59:45] probably say When Faith from an honest
[59:47] heart meets God them cogs just comes
[59:50] together like that and something has to
[59:52] take place he said I challenge this
[59:54] audience tonight in the name of Jesus
[59:56] Christ let your faith connect with God
[59:59] like that and in a few minutes we'll
[1:00:02] have another Pentecost there'll be such
[1:00:04] a Revival break out in this town if
[1:00:06] there wouldn't be enough cops in the
[1:00:08] country to keep it down he said there
[1:00:10] will be a real Revival
[1:00:13] I'm on Church what is a real Revival
[1:00:15] it's a real word manifestation of the
[1:00:19] real one true and living God what are

[1:00:43] gene seed on the inside of your soul and
[1:00:46] as a Christian amen you're reflecting
[1:00:48] your hormone church amen we're not just
[1:00:51] going to reflect our inheritance when we
[1:00:52] get on the other side amen by the
[1:00:55] prophet said there's some Believers
[1:00:56] that's on this side that'll be
[1:00:58] reflecting what they're going to if
[1:01:00] you're headed towards tribulation then
[1:01:02] you've got every reason to frown if
[1:01:04] you're headed towards the Lake of Fire

[1:01:08] backbone Pine Spirit on you amen but

[1:03:44] is because you were not freed by those
[1:03:46] things you were freed by the infallible
[1:03:48] spoken word of the almighty God and
[1:03:51] there's nothing in heaven and there's
[1:03:53] nothing on the earth and there's nothing
[1:03:55] in the pits of Hell amen that can defeat
[1:03:57] the word the word will defeat the Devil
[1:03:59] anywhere anytime any
[1:04:02] anywhere Anytime Anyplace under any
[1:04:05] condition the word will defeat that
[1:04:07] devil

[1:04:14] being entertained we're here being
[1:04:16] touched amen by more than just the mere
[1:04:18] words of a human preacher but

[1:07:21] has been written becomes interpreted and
[1:07:23] becomes fulfilled this day this
[1:07:25] scripture fulfilled what a word think of

[1:07:38] is The Interpreter of his own word this
[1:07:41] day is this scripture fulfilled come on
[1:07:44] church I don't have time to lay down
[1:07:46] every scripture that is concerning this
[1:07:49] bride but I do have time to say this the
[1:07:52] one who inspired it to be put in the
[1:07:54] holy writ is the one that is coming in
[1:07:57] this meeting this weekend to interpret
[1:07:59] and to confirm and to fulfill a known
[1:08:02] Church there's going to be somebody
[1:08:04] manifest the seven Divine Natures
[1:08:07] there's going to be somebody manifest

[1:08:18] the 16th chapter somebody's going to
[1:08:20] manifest it brother Mark he's not going
[1:08:22] to raise up rocks to do it but he's
[1:08:24] going to claim redeemed flesh and the
[1:08:26] son of man is going to take possession
[1:08:28] in the flesh of the bride and it's going
[1:08:31] to manifest what is in his word it's
[1:08:33] going to be in his church
[1:08:35] what are you saying I'm saying that the
[1:08:37] Messiah himself is standing in the
[1:08:40] presence of the congregation reading a
[1:08:42] word out of the Bible pertaining to
[1:08:44] himself and then says this day is his
[1:08:48] scripture fulfilled and they still
[1:08:50] failed to see it
[1:08:53] I'm on now let's preach the one by the
[1:08:56] heaven that read Luke 4 was the one that
[1:08:59] was in the beginning what's the one that
[1:09:01] anointed Zechariah was the one that
[1:09:03] anointed Isaiah was the one that became
[1:09:06] flesh in John 1 14 was the one that was
[1:09:09] standing in the synagogue come on church
[1:09:12] he was not reading about Isaiah he was
[1:09:14] reading about himself
[1:09:17] Mr hope how else could he break it down
[1:09:19] than to look at him and say what you're
[1:09:21] looking at in that word is who I am
[1:09:23] what's your lasting God to send is in
[1:09:26] your midst
[1:09:27] he said oh what a tragedy that would be
[1:09:30] but it's happened and he said it's
[1:09:32] happened many times he said and how
[1:09:34] could it happen of course like it did in
[1:09:36] other times by believing man's
[1:09:39] interpretation of a word that's what
[1:09:41] caused it come on there he is and they
[1:09:44] heard a man say he couldn't be the
[1:09:46] Messiah there it is and they heard a man
[1:09:49] say that he would not come the way he
[1:09:51] can he will not come of an illegitimate
[1:09:53] birth amen but there he was regardless
[1:09:55] of what private interpretations had said
[1:09:57] about him
[1:09:59] Mary was and they're missed come on
[1:10:01] Faith Tabernacle I'm gonna lose my mind
[1:10:03] and preach for a second every devil in
[1:10:05] hell says we can't see Revival in this
[1:10:07] church but for God who anointed William
[1:10:09] Branham and said if you'll surrender
[1:10:11] there'll be a Revival breakout in this
[1:10:13] church that God is in this building
[1:10:15] tonight and he's not here in a Corporal
[1:10:17] body he's not here with Nell prince in
[1:10:19] his hand but he is here in the form of
[1:10:21] his word and he's inviting you to
[1:10:23] recognize him and when you recognize his
[1:10:25] presence you will release his power when
[1:10:28] you recognize who he is
[1:10:31] those Believers in them they so-called
[1:10:33] Believers took the interpretation of the
[1:10:35] priest let me ask you this whose
[1:10:36] interpretation are you going to receive
[1:10:38] about this meeting
[1:10:40] whose interpretation are you going to
[1:10:43] receive about your healing whose
[1:10:45] interpretation are you going to receive
[1:10:46] about this message I say Amen we
[1:10:49] identify this interpretation as the
[1:10:52] perfect interpretation with Divine
[1:10:54] Vindication because he was different
[1:10:56] from the rest of them he said the person
[1:10:58] of Jesus Christ was so unique that no
[1:11:01] one should have missed see it he was the
[1:11:03] son of God because he was the perfect
[1:11:05] identification of what the scripture
[1:11:08] that was wrote of him was among usable
[1:11:10] Andrew I need a meeting I need the Holy
[1:11:13] Ghost to move I need something from God
[1:11:15] do you realize you're sitting in a
[1:11:17] church that is operating underneath a
[1:11:19] perfect identification of the way a
[1:11:21] prophet said a church only be in order
[1:11:23] you didn't come in here 30 minutes and a
[1:11:25] bunch of people running around talking
[1:11:26] about their Gardens you didn't come in
[1:11:28] here 30 minutes and some guy get up and
[1:11:30] come through a song book and try to find
[1:11:32] something to sing but there's been
[1:11:33] vessels there's been officers in
[1:11:35] position there's been preachers praying
[1:11:37] there's been husbands and wives
[1:11:39] dedicating himself why do you saying I'm
[1:11:41] saying Faith Tabernacle the sky is the
[1:11:44] limit to what God can do in the heart of
[1:11:46] this bride in the heart of this church
[1:11:48] we are not here as a bunch of
[1:11:49] Pentecostal Chuck we are here as a word
[1:11:52] born pride and we're manifesting brother
[1:11:55] Tim what a prophet said would be
[1:11:56] manifested in the age that we're living
[1:11:58] in oh yeah we're not here trying to
[1:12:01] identify ourselves the message has
[1:12:03] identified us
[1:12:05] I don't care what the world says the
[1:12:08] message has identified us you know what
[1:12:10] it has identified us as it has
[1:12:12] identified us as the people that Peter
[1:12:15] spoke of in the book of Peter when he
[1:12:17] said there'll be a people begotten us
[1:12:18] again unto a lively hope you know what
[1:12:21] they would have they would have an
[1:12:22] inheritance Incorruptible what is a
[1:12:25] jubilee it is a call it is a summons it
[1:12:29] is a pull to return to an inheritance
[1:12:32] and the prophet said your inheritance is
[1:12:35] Incorruptible it's undefiled it fadeth
[1:12:38] not away it is reserved in heaven for
[1:12:42] you Ray you might as well Square your
[1:12:44] shoulders back and tell that therefore
[1:12:46] you've been telling me you're going to
[1:12:48] take my inheritance but there ain't no
[1:12:50] way you can touch it because you didn't
[1:12:52] give it to me and you can't take it away
[1:12:55] what are you saying I'm saying you're a
[1:12:58] people of an inheritance that's
[1:13:00] Incorruptible it's undefiled your
[1:13:02] failures hadn't defiled it your mistakes
[1:13:05] haven't defiled it your trials hadn't
[1:13:07] defiled it it is an undefiable
[1:13:09] inheritance
[1:13:10] oh God hallelujah church I'm not a crazy
[1:13:14] man I'm an undefiled Holy Ghost Field
[1:13:17] fire baptized Pillar of Fire following
[1:13:19] son of the Living God that has not been
[1:13:22] begotten to some dead hope
[1:13:26] what I've been through don't change what
[1:13:28] I got
[1:13:30] hallelujah what I've been through don't
[1:13:33] change when I got the trials I faced and
[1:13:36] the mistakes I've made and the decisions
[1:13:38] I made does not change what my God
[1:13:40] reserved for me
[1:13:43] but I might as well preach that now you
[1:13:46] know what's that word Incorruptible
[1:13:47] means it means it has no principles of
[1:13:51] dissolution or decay in it therefore it
[1:13:55] must be totally different than this
[1:13:57] Earth Humble Church your inheritance is
[1:14:01] not painted with laodicea your
[1:14:04] inheritance is not painted with your
[1:14:07] trials among Church your family lineage
[1:14:10] cannot taint your Incorruptible seed
[1:14:13] let's hold the inside of your soul
[1:14:15] ammonium might as well draw your sword
[1:14:17] and fight back against that Devil he's
[1:14:20] been telling you you're not going to
[1:14:21] make it he's been 10 years going to fail
[1:14:23] but I come to tell you you are recorded
[1:14:25] in the scripture as a Son of God I said
[1:14:28] Potter of God with my uncomfortable
[1:14:31] inheritance of God
[1:14:33] I'm on church I tell you why that
[1:14:36] Devil's fighting you like he is because
[1:14:37] God's been holding you God's been
[1:14:39] reserving you come on oh God he's been
[1:14:43] had his hand on you for at times such as
[1:14:46] this because the very next verse he says
[1:14:49] who are kept
[1:14:50] by the power of God through faith unto
[1:14:54] salvation and are ready to be revealed
[1:14:57] in the last time what are you saying
[1:14:59] preacher I'm saying what Peter said you
[1:15:01] have been born again not of corruptable
[1:15:04] seed but of Incorruptible by the word of
[1:15:07] God which liveth and abideth forever I'm
[1:15:12] on church I might as well say it you're
[1:15:14] made out of stuff that is not
[1:15:16] contaminated with 16 elements of this
[1:15:19] Earth You Are Made you say preacher I
[1:15:22] got gray hair and my hair's thinning and
[1:15:24] my shoulders are stupid I'm not talking
[1:15:26] about your Humanity I'm talking about
[1:15:29] your original DNA I'm talking about
[1:15:31] where you come from I'm talking about oh
[1:15:34] that was put on the inside of you from
[1:15:36] before the foundation of the world
[1:15:39] and if a man is Born the word of God he
[1:15:42] will produce the word alone that's why
[1:15:44] that devil tells you you ain't doing
[1:15:45] much you are you are kicking that devil
[1:15:48] in the face right now just by being in
[1:15:50] the house of God on a Monday night with
[1:15:53] a smile on your face
[1:15:56] brother Tim we shouldn't be here but
[1:15:58] we're here anyhow sister Martha we
[1:16:01] shouldn't be here but we're here anyhow
[1:16:03] sister Heather we shouldn't be here but
[1:16:06] we're here anyhow you know why because
[1:16:09] you got through the trial because
[1:16:11] there's a jubilee attached to your soul
[1:16:13] and that Jubilee is drawing you that's
[1:16:16] why you can be in the middle of the
[1:16:18] deepest darkest trial and start dancing
[1:16:20] in the presence of God because there's a
[1:16:23] greater tug there's a greater influence
[1:16:25] there's a greater drawing power upon you
[1:16:27] than is on some Baptist chicken
[1:16:30] or some Pentecostal back sliding chicken
[1:16:32] there's a word anointing on you what are
[1:16:35] you saying I'm saying the seed that's in
[1:16:37] you is a God created seed
[1:16:41] and I'm saying this God created that
[1:16:43] seed inside of you what does Lucifer do
[1:16:46] oh he said brother remember said Lucifer
[1:16:48] is the deformer brother Wayne he's the
[1:16:51] corrupter of that seed he said but when
[1:16:53] we find out when he come in he deformed
[1:16:56] that seed he corrupted that seed by
[1:16:58] getting into the bedding grounds which
[1:17:00] was Eve are you with me
[1:17:02] and corrupting that seed with the
[1:17:04] corruptable seed before it could get
[1:17:06] there to corrupt that beautiful Garden
[1:17:08] of Eden but what old dumb Lucifer didn't
[1:17:11] know is God had a reserve seat
[1:17:15] what Lucifer didn't know is God had a
[1:17:18] soul on the earth that had a reserved
[1:17:21] Incorruptible seed on the inside of it
[1:17:24] that had had
[1:17:26] representation in heaven and the prophet
[1:17:28] said then where Heaven is the only thing
[1:17:31] that it is it's just the restoration are
[1:17:34] you ready for this are you ready for
[1:17:36] this where we are now we are on our road
[1:17:39] back to that original beginning of the
[1:17:43] creation of God oh something keeps
[1:17:45] holding me amen something keeps pulling
[1:17:48] me something keeps drawing me home I'll
[1:17:51] tell you what's pulling your church I'll
[1:17:53] tell you what's drawing you young people
[1:17:54] amen is a seed only inside of you amen
[1:17:58] the prophet sent back to the Garden of
[1:17:59] Eden again husband and wife without any
[1:18:02] sin or anything to live eternally
[1:18:06] oh God what is the way back can I tell
[1:18:09] you the prophet said the way back or the
[1:18:12] road back is the Holy Ghost he said see
[1:18:15] than God promised he would see him the
[1:18:17] Holy Ghost and whenever God sends his
[1:18:20] blessings and the people reject it
[1:18:22] that's a place always goes into chaos
[1:18:25] and just rots in its condition we're
[1:18:28] sure that the message and the power of
[1:18:29] God which we all believe in is strange
[1:18:32] to the world it strings to its way of
[1:18:35] thinking amen I believe amen our nation
[1:18:37] has practically done what the rest of
[1:18:40] them has done but now to honor it and to
[1:18:43] praise our God we are grateful for what
[1:18:46] he's given us we are grateful for what
[1:18:48] he's given us what are you saying I'm
[1:18:50] saying we are grateful that we did not
[1:18:53] come here to be identified but before we
[1:18:56] got here we was already identified
[1:18:58] Reverend said this in return and Jubilee
[1:19:00] He said Israel had a portion of
[1:19:02] inheritance in Palestine right he said
[1:19:04] see but the portion of inheritance could
[1:19:07] not be fulfilled by anyone else he said
[1:19:10] that's why when those babies was being
[1:19:12] born and the mother and their labor
[1:19:14] uttered their voices this patriarch he
[1:19:16] said what happened they positionally
[1:19:18] placed him in the Palestine amen
[1:19:21] hundreds of years later when that Mama
[1:19:24] brother Daniel was screaming out amen
[1:19:26] the names of those Patriarchs they were
[1:19:29] not even on the earth yet they was on
[1:19:31] their way into the Earth but a hundreds
[1:19:33] of years later what their mama spoke in
[1:19:36] her labor pains they manifested in their
[1:19:39] life
[1:19:40] what are you saying I'm saying even the
[1:19:42] odd rocks were positionally placed he
[1:19:45] said what's happened to Men He said God
[1:19:47] is in his Masterworks he said it's the
[1:19:51] placing of God shows the master
[1:19:57] and his Masterworks let me just say this
[1:20:00] if I'm up here tonight and I say hey
[1:20:02] like that I just holler out hey amen
[1:20:05] anybody in here can respond anybody can
[1:20:08] raise their hand anybody can say what do
[1:20:10] you need anybody can say what do you
[1:20:12] want but if I scream out in my pain and
[1:20:15] I say hey Sean I have just identified by
[1:20:18] name whose attention I'm trying to get
[1:20:20] and the prophet of God said them women
[1:20:23] were not just making noises but they
[1:20:25] were speaking names they were speaking
[1:20:27] identification I'm on Church them women
[1:20:30] called those names in their birth pains
[1:20:33] what do you saying I'm saying what a
[1:20:35] prophet said he said Brethren ye have
[1:20:37] been called unto Liberty only use not
[1:20:40] Liberty for an occasion to the flesh but
[1:20:43] by love serve one another look at this
[1:20:45] word called it means to utter out of out
[1:20:47] voice it means to call by name it means
[1:20:50] to give a name it means to receive a
[1:20:53] name it needs to give someone a name to
[1:20:55] call his name come on church when you
[1:20:58] see the word Liberty in the Bible amen
[1:21:01] you can put your name there because the
[1:21:04] prophet said before the foundation of
[1:21:06] the world he said God in his labor pain
[1:21:10] was bringing forth you knowing what you
[1:21:13] would do he positionally placed you in
[1:21:16] his own body to be a housewife to be a
[1:21:19] farmer a good name to be a preacher he
[1:21:22] meant to be a prophet to be this he
[1:21:24] placed you positionally come on Church
[1:21:27] you didn't stumble into your position
[1:21:29] but the same God that anointed them
[1:21:32] mothers to call the names of them
[1:21:34] Patriarchs is the same God when he hung
[1:21:36] between the heavens and the Earth and he
[1:21:38] screamed out the prophet said that was
[1:21:40] God's labor pains and he was
[1:21:43] positionally placing you oh help me
[1:21:45] Jesus what are you saying preacher I'm
[1:21:47] saying you're not here by accident I'm
[1:21:49] saying your position didn't get given to
[1:21:51] you because somebody else couldn't do it
[1:21:53] I'm saying you've been called in this
[1:21:55] Jubilee you've been positionally placed
[1:21:57] in this Jubilee God in his Masterworks
[1:22:01] has promised to church in the end time
[1:22:03] that will not be haphasially floating
[1:22:05] around but they will be a positionally
[1:22:09] I just got to preacher if that's okay
[1:22:10] there'll be a positionally placed church
[1:22:13] he said what did Jesus do Jesus did the
[1:22:16] works of the father why because the
[1:22:19] father was in him that God the Father
[1:22:21] which is in the father of Jesus Christ
[1:22:23] the great spirit dwelt in the fullness
[1:22:25] of this power in Jesus Christ which was
[1:22:28] the Tabernacle of God made Flesh dwelt
[1:22:32] on Earth representing the word then
[1:22:34] Jesus was the Tabernacle of God on the
[1:22:38] earth come on church he was on the Earth
[1:22:40] but he had an inheritance that was
[1:22:43] Incorruptible he had a connection he had
[1:22:45] a he had a position with a father and
[1:22:48] the brother said Jesus was the word he
[1:22:50] said so the word was invisible until it
[1:22:53] was made flesh and then the word became
[1:22:56] visible and through his sacrificial
[1:22:58] death at Calvary and his resurrection he
[1:23:01] has positionally placed his church in
[1:23:04] that realm then the same invisible God
[1:23:07] could come into the individual and make
[1:23:10] the word visible that's why the devil's
[1:23:12] fighting you with everything he's kind
[1:23:14] is you are the prepared womb to receive
[1:23:17] amen that DNA the genos the chemistry
[1:23:21] the life the token the power of God in
[1:23:24] this wicked age and to make an invisible
[1:23:27] God made visible in the age you're
[1:23:28] living in
[1:23:30] a bone Church you're not here to stay
[1:23:35] look at somebody next to you and say
[1:23:37] Lift Your Head Up

[1:23:57] you don't realize how bad it is I don't
[1:23:59] care how bad it is you know why because
[1:24:02] no matter how bad it is there is a cord
[1:24:05] of Prophecy wrapped around you in this
[1:24:08] Jubilee age you have heard the trumpet
[1:24:10] sound your eyes have been opened your
[1:24:13] ears have been unstopped your tongue has
[1:24:15] been loose your heart has been freed
[1:24:18] the shackles have been taken off here
[1:24:21] what are you saying I'm saying we got an
[1:24:24] inheritance and we got to go home we
[1:24:26] can't stay here I'm no church do you
[1:24:28] realize when Israel was in the mud pits
[1:24:31] that was the same ones whose mothers had
[1:24:33] called their names and their birth
[1:24:35] paints when Israel was in a terrible
[1:24:37] condition they still had a cord of
[1:24:41] Prophecy
[1:24:43] wrapped around them of the promised land
[1:24:46] I'm on a preacher for a second we'll
[1:24:47] close Okay think of this when you think
[1:24:50] of bondage what do you think of you
[1:24:52] think of the children of Israel in the
[1:24:55] land of Egypt now Genesis 15 1 says the
[1:24:58] word of the Lord came unto Abram in a
[1:25:01] vision saying fear not Abraham I am thus
[1:25:04] Shield thy exceeding great reward
[1:25:06] Birmingham said look God led the
[1:25:09] children of the Israel from down in
[1:25:11] Egypt up into the promised land no since
[1:25:15] Genesis 15 12 and when the sun was going
[1:25:17] down
[1:25:19] a deep sleep fell upon Abram and lo a
[1:25:23] of great Darkness fell upon him
[1:25:25] and he said in Abram nor the surety that
[1:25:27] thy seed shall be estranged in land that
[1:25:30] is not theirs and Shall Serve them and
[1:25:33] they shall afflict them for 400 years
[1:25:36] and also the nation whom they Shall
[1:25:39] Serve will I judge notice this and
[1:25:42] afterward shall they come out so many
[1:25:45] say come out afterward they shall come
[1:25:48] out with great substance look at this
[1:25:51] word great substance it is property it
[1:25:54] is good it is possession it is a general
[1:25:57] term for all movable Goods of livestock
[1:26:01] of stores and of utensils in other words
[1:26:05] he said listen I know you're in bondage
[1:26:07] I know you're in a terrible condition
[1:26:09] but I have made a covenant with Father
[1:26:12] Abraham that you're going to suffer in
[1:26:14] these conditions but hold on you're not
[1:26:16] going to stay there you've got
[1:26:18] identification in the Jubilee you've got
[1:26:21] identification listen if you don't have
[1:26:23] inheritance then the Jubilee trumpet
[1:26:25] means nothing to you if you don't have
[1:26:28] inheritance if you hadn't lost nothing
[1:26:29] then you can sleep in church if you
[1:26:32] hadn't lost nothing these meetings are
[1:26:33] just taking up your time if you hadn't
[1:26:36] lost nothing going to church is a burden
[1:26:38] but if you have lost something and I'll
[1:26:40] tell you what you lost Amen to our
[1:26:42] adulterous prayer and Eve we lost our
[1:26:44] position amen the way we should have
[1:26:46] come we should have not come to a
[1:26:48] natural act we should have come to the
[1:26:50] spoken word amen but in the end time who
[1:26:52] is this Melchizedek God would send a
[1:26:54] prophet to tell you that's a reason you
[1:26:57] cannot be happy with that human spirit
[1:26:59] that you contacted is because down
[1:27:01] inside of you was a gene seed attribute
[1:27:04] of almighty God and it was drawing at
[1:27:08] you
[1:27:09] glory to God Israel was in a terrible
[1:27:12] condition laodicea is a terrible
[1:27:14] condition babies were being killed by
[1:27:16] the Terry they were working till their
[1:27:18] bodies were falling apart how many days
[1:27:20] brother Wayne did they wonder will
[1:27:23] Deliverance ever come how many days did
[1:27:25] they pray and ask God for deliver but
[1:27:28] I'll tell you what happened there were
[1:27:29] some older slaves there that would
[1:27:31] remember the vision
[1:27:34] there was some older slaves there that
[1:27:37] would remember the vision and when they
[1:27:39] got real down they would reach over and
[1:27:41] get a hold of David's principle you say
[1:27:43] what is David's principle David's
[1:27:45] principle is David was greatly
[1:27:47] distressed and the people spake and
[1:27:50] stone in him and saw on all the people
[1:27:51] as Creed every man for his son for his
[1:27:54] daughters but David Oh Glory to God
[1:27:57] David encouraged himself in the Lord you
[1:28:01] know what they had a positive confession
[1:28:03] I can hear him say God will raise up and
[1:28:06] deliver I could hear him say his word
[1:28:08] said he would I could hear him say be
[1:28:10] strong and be courageous because one day
[1:28:13] we're leaving here what do you say in

[1:30:05] tell you how you get out of this I'll
[1:30:07] tell you how you get out of this you got
[1:30:09] an inheritance and the god that promised
[1:30:11] you that Heritage is a God that cannot
[1:30:13] fail and he wrote that inheritance in
[1:30:16] his word I'm on church God
[1:30:19] y'all forgive me I'm trying to contain
[1:30:22] myself but God is the never unfailing
[1:30:25] god of the Bible what are you saying I'm
[1:30:28] saying you'll never find one time from
[1:30:31] Genesis to Revelation from 47 to 65 from
[1:30:35] the church age book from the seventh
[1:30:36] syllabus you'll never find one time
[1:30:38] that's the conditional God ever failed
[1:30:41] his church
[1:30:43] when God put something in the scripture
[1:30:46] he backed it up what he said he would do
[1:30:49] he has done come on church he is doing
[1:30:53] or he will do do not let the devil talk
[1:30:56] you out of the greatest Revival that has
[1:30:59] ever hit the face of the Earth do not
[1:31:01] let the devil weaken your potentials
[1:31:03] town to just being a chicken in a walled
[1:31:06] City eating a few denominational crumbs
[1:31:08] and trying to get by you was born from
[1:31:11] above you was born for this Jubilee
[1:31:14] well I might as well preach at my
[1:31:16] brother Mark quit letting that devil
[1:31:18] tell you that your loved ones ain't
[1:31:19] going quit letting that devil tell you
[1:31:21] that you got to leave this behind and
[1:31:23] leave that behind reach over church and
[1:31:26] get a hold of Moses his principle and
[1:31:28] walk up to that devil and say when I
[1:31:30] leave here I'm not leaving a hook behind
[1:31:32] big boy get out of my way I'm taking my
[1:31:35] husband I'm taking my wife I'm taking my
[1:31:38] babies I'm taking my church

[1:31:44] Incorruptible inheritance is tied to the
[1:31:46] New Jerusalem behold I will send you
[1:31:49] Elijah can I have a few more minutes I
[1:31:51] will send you Elijah the prophet before
[1:31:53] the coming of the great and Dreadful day
[1:31:55] of the Lord he shall turn the heart of
[1:31:57] the fathers to the children and the
[1:31:59] Heart of the children to their fathers
[1:32:01] lest I would come smile the other curse
[1:32:03] brother said watch just to confirm his
[1:32:05] word to you if the messenger of John was
[1:32:08] the messenger Malachi 4 then the
[1:32:10] scriptures failed because God said the
[1:32:13] Earth would be burning stubble righteous
[1:32:15] would walk out upon the ashes of the
[1:32:16] wicked so read it right Jesus never said
[1:32:19] that can I break this down to an
[1:32:21] evangelistical point right here Jesus
[1:32:23] never said that a part of this message
[1:32:25] was brother Bam's opinion
[1:32:28] Jesus never said the message of
[1:32:31] Revelation 10 7 was to be picked and
[1:32:33] taken out but he said it was the
[1:32:36] infallible thoroughly identified word of
[1:32:40] almighty God and what are you saying I'm
[1:32:42] saying right here on a Monday night in
[1:32:45] the house of God I hear more than the
[1:32:48] voice of brother Sean I hear more than
[1:32:50] the singer the brother Samaya I hear
[1:32:53] more than the playing of brother Kevin I
[1:32:55] hear more than the amen so brother Wayne
[1:32:57] I hear more than the amen to Brother
[1:33:00] Steve or I hear the sound of the Jubilee
[1:33:03] trumpet I thank God for all the other
[1:33:05] sounds but oh if we don't have the sound
[1:33:08] of the Jubilee trumpet we have gathered
[1:33:10] here in vain you've wasted your time to
[1:33:13] drive but I tell you tonight friends
[1:33:15] don't you let the devil back you off of
[1:33:17] one potential this meeting you got a
[1:33:20] right to rise up brother Matthew and put
[1:33:22] your foot on your inheritance and tell
[1:33:25] that long tongue line Slew Foot devil
[1:33:27] take your hands off of my property take
[1:33:30] your hands off of my family take your
[1:33:32] hands off of my church take your hands
[1:33:34] off of my dance take your hands off of
[1:33:36] my Shout
[1:33:37] what are you saying I'm saying the
[1:33:39] trumpet's not going to sound the trumpet
[1:33:41] is sounding the Bible said the trumpet
[1:33:43] gives an uncertain sound who shall
[1:33:46] prepare himself for the battle remember
[1:33:48] so what is that trumpet he said that
[1:33:50] trumpet is the gospel and when you hear
[1:33:53] the sound of the Jubilee trumpet the
[1:33:56] gospel you can go free
[1:34:00] the Jubilee trumpet is not an uncertain
[1:34:03] sound it is your freedom it is your
[1:34:06] pardon it is not an emotion it is not a
[1:34:10] gift it is not a sensation it is a
[1:34:13] certain Vindicated manifested infallible
[1:34:16] word of almighty God I'm on church I
[1:34:19] tell you why we're shouting tonight
[1:34:20] brother Terry because this trumpet is
[1:34:23] not just sounding in our heads it's
[1:34:25] sounding in our heart would there be
[1:34:27] anybody here tonight that would say oh
[1:34:29] God I'm ready to Rejoice I'm ready to
[1:34:32] Proclaim Liberty I'm ready to praise God
[1:34:35] I'm ready to shake off the heaviness I'm
[1:34:37] ready to shake off this lukewarm sour
[1:34:40] down condition I'm ready to be more than
[1:34:42] just a Pew Center I'm ready to be a
[1:34:44] messiah I'm ready to be more than a weak
[1:34:47] beat down to Phoenix Hunter daughter of
[1:34:49] God I'm ready to be a Victorious product
[1:34:51] of the revelation of the age that is
[1:34:54] pierced my generation what are you
[1:34:56] saying I'm saying if we had nothing
[1:34:59] brother Mark to be turned to if we had
[1:35:01] nothing to return to then the trumpet
[1:35:04] would mean nothing to us but the reason
[1:35:05] why God brother Mark the reason why is
[1:35:09] she got a mom over there and you got a
[1:35:11] daddy over there come on church I tell
[1:35:14] you why this trumpet means something to
[1:35:15] you it's cause you got something over
[1:35:17] there
[1:35:19] and it's pulling at you it's drawing at
[1:35:22] you what are you saying preacher I'm
[1:35:23] saying it's trolling you back to your
[1:35:26] original inheritance brother Terry
[1:35:27] brother Terry it's drawing us we're not
[1:35:31] pushing our way we're not forcing our
[1:35:32] way
[1:35:34] it's drawing back to a Pentecostal
[1:35:37] inheritance remember said the
[1:35:39] Pentecostal experience is your
[1:35:40] possession he said see amen I'm gonna
[1:35:42] I'm gonna tie this together right here
[1:35:44] in the days of the voice of the seventh
[1:35:47] Angels when he shall begin to sound
[1:35:51] the mystery of God should be finished in
[1:35:55] other words the pardon would be
[1:35:57] delivered to the church you can wake up
[1:35:59] and realize you did not become a son you
[1:36:02] did not become a seed you you all wait

[1:36:07] the seventh angel what's the come on
[1:36:09] Leviticus 25 right in the 10th month of
[1:36:12] the seventh day brother Shema I don't
[1:36:14] believe my God writes scripture by
[1:36:16] accident in the tenth day of the seventh
[1:36:19] month among what is revelation 10 in the
[1:36:21] Revelation the 10th chapter and the
[1:36:23] seventh verse is the same scripture the
[1:36:26] prophet said when he begins to sound
[1:36:28] we'll declare war on every devil
[1:36:32] come on now we'll declare war on every
[1:36:35] devil what are you saying I'm saying
[1:36:37] church you can rise up and we can go
[1:36:39] home no I'm not talking about Garlic
[1:36:42] Road I'm not talking about Reiner I'm
[1:36:45] not talking about Pilate I'm talking
[1:36:47] about eternity I'm talking about the
[1:36:49] place where we were born from oh God
[1:36:52] what are you saying I'm saying this amen
[1:36:54] it's time to go forward
[1:36:56] look at somebody next to you and say
[1:36:58] it's time to go forward time to go
[1:37:00] forward I know you was born in sin I
[1:37:02] know I was shaping iniquity but there's
[1:37:04] a sound of a trumpet that's what I'm
[1:37:06] saying he said God through his grace has
[1:37:09] declared it's a Year of Jubilee He said
[1:37:12] oh we were under alone we are sold in
[1:37:14] sin our parents sowed us out to the sin
[1:37:16] in the Garden of Eden we were Laden of
[1:37:18] the bonds of sin and slave to the devil
[1:37:20] we were born that way there was nothing
[1:37:22] we could do to help us oh our whole
[1:37:24] makeup our whole nature everything we
[1:37:26] are is sin but when the Jubilee time
[1:37:28] comes
[1:37:29] when the Jubilee time comes we are free
[1:37:34] what he's saying I'm saying remember
[1:37:36] what he said you don't owe any debts at
[1:37:40] all
[1:37:43] you're no longer have to live in sin you
[1:37:47] can go home and be free the whole
[1:37:50] emancipation of proclamation is done
[1:37:54] signed and you are free what are you
[1:37:58] saying ye shall know the truth what is
[1:38:00] truth the word you shall know the word
[1:38:03] and the word shall make you free listen
[1:38:06] to me tonight friends we are not here
[1:38:08] tied down any longer we are not a bunch
[1:38:10] of pigs like Peter spoke of wallowing in
[1:38:13] the mire we have got a vision we've got
[1:38:16] a direction
[1:38:17] can I close with this I find it amazing
[1:38:21] Birmingham comes to return in Jubilee
[1:38:22] and says this closing out yes sir they
[1:38:25] made a rational mistake when they did
[1:38:27] that and they wondered for 40 years
[1:38:29] that's exactly what they done they
[1:38:31] wondered for 40 years when they wasn't
[1:38:34] over five days away from the promised

[2:08:07] our visitors and
[2:08:09] [Music]
[2:08:11] can't name them all but I I certainly
[2:08:13] appreciate you ministers brother Mark
[2:08:15] brother Tim brother Steve
[2:08:17] and your congregations coming and just
[2:08:23] being apart and we're just looking for
[2:08:25] greater things we want to keep brother
[2:08:29] Andrew and brother Wayne in our prayer
[2:08:32] that the Lord will just give them
[2:08:33] strength amen and you know the devil's
[2:08:37] as the prophet said the devil's trying
[2:08:39] to keep men like that out of the pulpits
[2:08:42] and whether it's physically mentally or
[2:08:46] whatever it would be just trying to
[2:08:48] attack and I know brother Andrew who's
[2:08:50] got a sore throat and yet he pressed
[2:08:53] past that to preach to us tonight I
[2:08:57] appreciate men that'll just push past it
[2:08:59] all amen just so that we could hear the
[2:09:02] word of God Amen they spend their time
[2:09:05] in this message and and not just to
[2:09:09] learn but they do it because they've got
[2:09:11] a burden there's a gift that God's
[2:09:13] placed within them for us a man that
[2:09:16] when they would open their mouth to
[2:09:18] preach it would be the message of the
[2:09:20] hour amen because it's the message that
[2:09:23] is quickening changing our lives
[2:09:25] so we certainly appreciate that and
[2:09:29] throughout this week at the every end of
[2:09:32] service uh
[2:09:35] as far as the ministers they probably
[2:09:37] ain't going to be visiting much with you
[2:09:39] uh and it's not because of being snobs
[2:09:42] or whatever it's it's mainly just
[2:09:44] because of the weather and to uh they
[2:09:49] want to preserve their strength as as
[2:09:52] they've got several nights to preach and
[2:09:55] so you just have to Pardon that and at
[2:09:58] the end of the meeting we'll we'll have
[2:10:00] a ball and have Fellowship amen and so
[2:10:04] we certainly love you remember service
[2:10:07] tomorrow night at seven o'clock and tell
[2:10:10] your friends to come amen we've got the
[2:10:13] the most greatest message ever and they
[2:10:16] need to hear this the coming of the Lord
[2:10:18] is here amen and something that can be
[2:10:21] said and I just pray and I know that God
[2:10:24] will give give them understanding of
[2:10:27] what is being said he's just that way
[2:10:29] isn't he and so God bless you love you
[2:10:32] appreciate you and let's just bow our
[2:10:35] heads in a word of prayer and brother
[2:10:39] Mark you want to come and Lead user
[2:10:41] dismiss us in prayer
[2:10:47] foreign
