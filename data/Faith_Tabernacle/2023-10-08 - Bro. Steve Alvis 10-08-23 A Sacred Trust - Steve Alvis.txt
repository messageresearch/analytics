in the service with y'all thank you my brother I think we're getting a little bit of ring on this thank you brother good to be with you miss our brother Sean we appreciate the uh privilege to have worship god with you let him break the bread of life for us tonight together and uh if you have your Bibles would I like to turn to the book of uh Romans chapter 7 start to [Laughter] preach well okay bring greetings from the Saints and GX brother Darren said tell youall hello and uh oh there's some other things I'm supposed to say I don't remember right now we'll just we'll try to get into the word um Romans 7 and verse one know ye not brethren for I speak to them that know the law how that the law hath dominion over man as long as he liveth so he's speaking of the law here the law has dominion over man as long as he liveth then he says verse Two for the woman which hath an husband is bound by the law to her husband so long as he liveth but if the husband be dead she is loose from the law of her husband so then if while her husband liveth she be married to another man she shall be called an adulteress but if her husband be dead she is free from that law so that she is no more adulterous though she be married to another man wherefore my brethren ye are ye also are become dead to the law by the body of Christ that ye should be married to another even to him who is raised from the dead that we should bring forth fruit unto God for when we were in the flesh the Motions of sins which were by the law did work in our members to bring forth fruit unto death for now but now we are delivered from the law that being dead wherein we were held that we should serve in the newness of spirit and not in the oldness of the letter let us pray our dear God we love you we thank you for thy mercy and thy Grace for thy truth Lord we thank you for the message of this hour Lord for awaking us from our Slumber our sleep Lord God let the light of God rise and shine upon us Lord God we thank you for bringing us out of Darkness Lord God for for for giving us a new husband a new nature father we love you we thank you for the privilege of worshiping with you with the saints of God to Worship You Lord God in spirit and in truth that you've liberated us from denominationalism from man's ideas from person personalities Lord and and all the rest that we can be free to serve you Lord God in truth and in spirit Lord I just welcome you to have the preeminence in the service tonight we welcome you together we wanted to see you father we' have come to hear from you father God and we would ask that you drive back every Spirit that's contrary to you contrary to your word this message that the prophet of God brought us father help me to get myself out of the way that you can bring it forth the way he brought it Lord father we we just ask you to have your way and your preeminence in this service that you bless your people bless our brother sha as he whenever he'd be back on the road traveling back lord may we all be found closer to you than tonight when we leave here than how we came in Lord may you bless your people and meet the needs in jesus' name amen God bless you may be seated so tonight well not going to preach marriage and divorce so so just um even though those scriptures could maybe pertain to that but I'd like to speak on uh a sacred trust so we we might if you're familiar with the message you you've seen that uh phrase before and invisible Union of the Bride so uh so that's uh but God's help and Grace is what we like to speak on tonight a sacred trust so we see here Paul is speaking about law and Grace and he's typing out like it would be marriage and divorce um that's right but but he's speaking of something else speaking of something greater he's speaking of the church and of Christ see we are the bride we are married to him he is our headship and so then he he he preaches that message invisible Union of the Bride he he doesn't preach it at Jeffersonville he preaches it down in shareport and it wasn't very well received was it but well not by them but by us it was was wasn't it and uh the bride's going to receive the word of God amen amen I was looking for a clock all right I need to find out when I start sometimes cuz uh we uh want to hand to service over to our brother I don't see him now but I don't want to hand it over to brother Sean we be here a while all right so in Ephesians 5 and 25 Paul says husbands love your wives even as Christ also loved the church and gave himself for it that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of the Water by the word so he's talking about the church here again in Ephesians now that he might present to himself a glorious church not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing but that it should be holy and without blemish this is God's vision of his bride he will bring it to pass this is God's vision of you of me of those who will be translated in this last day she will be without spot she will be without blemish and what God's word come to produce it will produce without fail God never fails his word is true it will not fall to the ground every last predestinated seat of God will come in and then we'll go home that's right all right husbands love your wives even if also Christ loved the church and gave himself for it that's his love for us expressing that now husbands you ought to express your love to your wife the same way now but I didn't come to preach on that part of it okay Glory CU Paul says nevertheless and then there but anyway that he might sanctify it so he's our sanctifier and he might cleanse it with the washing of the Water by the word so when the word of God comes forth It's the washing of the water the word that cleanses us when we confess our sins to him he is faithful and just to cleanse us and to forgive us of all unrighteousness we canot clean ourselves we'll be like the leopard licking the spots and they just get brighter more contrast but he can wash us as white as snow glory and the washing of the word that keeps us clean like they they went to the labor they they got their they would wash their hands and their feet and so forth they and and Peter when he was uh getting his feet Washed by Jesus he said oh Lord wash me all over he said no you're already been washed you're already but but it's sufficient I just you have to wash your feet so we get Washed by the washing of the water of the word so that now this is him doing it this is a man doing this with the the word of God it's it's God using the man God's spirit speaking through man that he can he's the one that's washing the church the preacher doesn't have to drag you up to the Altar and scrub you down behind the ears but the word of God might do it all right yeah all right now okay but but he's doing it for a reason that he can present to himself he's the one doing the presenting yeah he's presenting to himself a glorious church he doesn't make junk he does everything right he is not a failure I might be a failure and maybe in our flesh we all are but he is not Glory he will perform the work until the end that which he started he will finish he will have a she will be without spot she will be without blemish now this old flesh it's going to be a cuckle burn till the day you die that's right but this thing on the inside the character of Jesus Christ it will be there in every elected member of the body of Christ for sure praise God you won't have a spot you won't have a wrinkle you will be holy and without blemish in his sight we thank God for the blood of Jesus Christ for without that it wouldn't be possible he says so ought men to love their wives as their own bodies so now remember this is for the church Christ loves us that much he that loveth his wife loveth himself for no man ever yet hated his own flesh but nourish and cherish it even as the Lord the church we are members of his body of his flesh and of his bones for this call shall the man leave a father and mother shall be joined with his wife and they shall two be one flesh this is a great mystery but I speak concerning Christ and the church praise God and and here we see in in 2 Corinthians 11 2-4 Paul says for I'm jealous over you with a Godly jealousy for I have espoused you this is the first church age now I have espoused you or engaged you betrothed you espoused you to one husband that I may present you a Chase virgin to christl this was God's desire through his first church age Messenger to present to Christ a a bride without spot without wrinkle well we know she fell at niia he says but I fear lest by any means as the serpent beguiled Eve through his subtility so your mind should be corrupted from the Simplicity that is in Christ they were taken away from the simp Simplicity God is re hidden in Simplicity and revealed in Simplicity why do you think the prophet of God at the opening of the seals had to open with that to bring us back to the full revelation of Jesus Christ to espouse a bride to Christ he had to get her back to the Simplicity and away from denominational man's theology amen corruption caused them to leave Simplicity of the Gospel of Jesus Christ verse four for if he that cometh preacheth another Jesus whom we have not preached or you receive another Spirit which we have not received which you have not received or another gospel which you've not accepted you might be you might well bear with him so so there's a bride we're going to be a little slow getting started perhaps but that's okay Proverbs 30:20 such is the way of an adulterous woman she eateth she W and wipeth her mouth and saith I have done no wickedness all right we're going to read Genesis 3 and one here now the serpent he was more subtle than any beast of the field which the Lord God hath made and he said unto the woman yeath God said ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden and the woman said unto the serpent we may eat of every tree of the garden and the woman said unto the serpent we may eat of the fruit of the Trees of the garden but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden God that said ye shall not eat it neither shall you touch it lest you die for God that doth know in the day that you eat thereof then your eyes shall be opened and you shall be as Gods knowing good and evil and when the woman saw that the tree was good for food and that it was pleasant to the eyes in a tree to be desired to make one wise she took the fruit thereof and did eat and gave also unto her husband with her and he did eat and the eyes of both of them were opened and they knew that they were naked and they sewed fig leaves together and made themselves aprons okay getting started now all right brother brandom said this is the best age to live in Hallelujah been down through the church ages there was a defilement there was another seed that came in the only Original Seed is the word of God the spoken word is the Original Seed it's the only thing that has life in it it's the only thing that can bring life to you and I then down through the Paul's age we would have loved to walked with Jesus we would Lov to hear the preaching of Paul we would Lov to been in service when they they preached past midnight and the and the young man fell out the window and died and was resurrected again wonderful times but we're living in another day it it would have been a wonderful thing to see Martin Luther put his thesis on the door of whittenberg Germany and say I protest the the Roman Catholic Church the just shall live by faith it was a wonderful thing in his day because life was coming out of a dead ground out of a Dark Ages right it would have been a great day to be in the days of Wesley and so on and it was for those who live there that's right but I'm glad I didn't live there amen when when sanctification was coming back into the church it would have been a great day at at the isua Street Revival when the when the gifts were restored into the church and the baptism of the Holy Ghost was was was being poured out Revival fire was striking the nation wonderful time but we're living a better day we're living in a greater day brother Brandon said I'm thankful to God to be living in this time of the closing of the scenes of the world's history I don't know if I would have had to say so before the foundation of the world and God would have laid out the old program to me and said I want you to preach and know what age you're going to desire go to the Earth to preach which which one would you pick he said I'd pick out of chose this age for I think this is the Golden Age why would I love to have heard Jesus say come unto me all ye that labor and are heavy laden I will give you rest oh how I love to to have been like they're sitting where John said to lean my head upon his bosom oh Lord won't you tell me something oh tell me what's going to be tomorrow what about this man over here Peter asked a question he said what's it to you follow thou me me might have been a little rougher than we think sometimes oh now what do we we I I would like that would we would we like when he go to church with Jesus and he's tearing down the money changers well he's making a whip and driving people out of the temple he looked up on them with anger amen well I would like to seen that but I don't think I could have run fast enough save my eyes he got out of there too when they were going to throw him over the hill he looked for a place to escape cuz it wasn't his time amen so well he's altogether lovely he has a way of doing things so uh yes we would like to have stood there with Peter when he said that day to Lord Lord to whom shall we go when the 70 had left we we love to set with there like the disciples and when they say Lord is it I is it I when he said one of you shall betray me Lord is it I they were searching themselves and they thought Judas was just going to go and and buy something for for them and oh they kind of thought well I wonder who it is but they were searching for themselves they were searching their own heart right we we would lik to have been there and not been Judas and we wouldn't have been because we weren't predestinated to that but we weren't predestinated for that allotment of time we were called for this age this day to live on Earth at this time at the coming of the Lord there has to be a bride that's going to be translated that's going to be changed in the moment and the twinkling of an eye and she is here that's right there's a portion of her here tonight you've been called to this you've been elected to this you've been chosen for this to believe this message for this day to manifest it not just to confess it though you will but to live it to manifest every promise to overcome every devil to overcome every temptation to overcome this body of death in so much that The Showdown of the Rapture you will be changed in a moment and the twinkling of an eye the bride will overcome she will be changed God's seal is upon her soul and the seal that is on there will change her body on that day she shall be changed in moment in the twinkling of an eye because right now she's walking with God like Enoch walked with God and he was not for God took him prise Lord this is the greatest age hallelujah thank you Jesus amen this is the greatest age to live in I would like to have been in the meetings with brother brandham it wasn't my lot of time but this is yet a greater time though the world is in full Darkness gross Darkness is upon the people sin the sodomites of the world are are increasing doing ungodly things pushing ungodly programs and agendas Satan is seated in his in his throne being worshiped as God the God of this evil age amen but the bride's in good shape she still has light there's light in gohost in tonight she's gonna be taken up she will overcome every spirit that others fell with the spirit that overtook Judas to sell his Birthright the spirit that took overtook Esau the bride can be tempted by that she will not give into it somebody's going to have to overcome that for this day and this age I don't care what Satan tells you I don't care what accusers tell you the bride will overcome GL it's Satan says you're not a son of God because you've entertained a thought because Satan had a question you couldn't answer it doesn't matter the bride will overcome you've been ordained to overcome that you've been ordained to cast it down in the name of Jesus you've been ordained to love your brother you've been ordained to perfect Divine love and manifestation of this message thank you Jesus praise the Lord God thank you Jesus praise she can be tempted but she will be victorious against every spirit that took the the lives of the Prophet Noah died her drunk yeah she's overcome that Spirit many of you have oh yes she's overcome what David's adultery that he he he he got twisted up there he didn't have the Holy Ghost but the bride she will overcome that spirit amen Lord she'll overcome every Spirit that's good brother it shows that the Jes the blood of Jesus Christ it shows that the atonement is sufficient to overcome that that Satan is defeated amen the atonement the blood of Jesus Christ is good enough to conquer every spirit that has taken man on the face of the Earth it conquered the the spirit of deception that came in the the first church age there as a white horse rider right and they were they were Anointed with that lion the l i o n Spirit the spirit of the lion with that boldness to overcome for their day and we could go down Through the Ages but every Church age was an Ed with the power with the spirit of God to overcome The Temptations for their age yes sir so will the bride be in this age she's been given victory over every Spirit she's been given victory over worldliness she's been given victory over living a carnal life amen amen she's been given Victory she's able to Fly Above man's ideas with the eagle anointing she's able she's been given prophetic Vision she's a prophetic class of people oh Hallelujah she will fly high glory and be changed in the moment twinkling of an eye thank you Lord prise the Lord Brother bam says we know that history is closing out the world's history will soon be over and then we're going to step into a new day into the great Millennium I still believe in the Millennium I still believe there's going to be a bride that's going to tread on the ashes of the wicked when she comes back after the the Great Tribulation and that she's going to have a Thousand-Year honeymoon with Jesus Christ because but she's married to him right here the the wedding band of predestinated unmar to Grace has slipped on her finger right here she has received it she's married to Christ right now amen we're going to not a marriage ceremony we're going to a wedding supper Lord all right here I'm going get to the intro all right Paul was the scripture that we read in Romans 7 s brother Brandon reads us this uh portion of scripture here in The Invisible Union of the Bride he says Paul here is giving an illustration in our scripture about law and Grace illustrating it like marriage and divorce and then I'm going to skip a little bit but most of the quotes I'm going to read will be from invisible Union of the Bride if you want to go back and listen to that you'll see how I was preaching the message and if if you find out something I say that's different you you come and talk to me please I said uh I was preach on creatures of Eternity one time and uh kept saying we're creatures of ET eternity we're not creatures of time and I said it the wrong way one time my wife said you know you said that once I said no I didn't did it really I had to say well my wife told me I said this and sorry take me for to mean or say or something like that but uh we make mistakes but not intentionally all right we don't handle the word of God deceitfully Amen Lord bless him Jesus amen good brother all right so the Scripture it also pertains to a greater portion a marriage divorce he says how that he's trying to set an order that we as a church can no be married no more be married to the world and to Christ at the same time and be legal and lawful about it then a woman can be living with a husband while she's got living husband now we would call that adultery and we should call the other thing adultery as well it's spiritual adultery sure now he said here that this unfolds one of the great mysteries of Prophecy this scripture here okay speaking of Christ having a bride we cannot be married to the world and to Christ at the same time come on Amen we have one husband we have one lover and the life we live proves who that is no matter what we say out of her mouth now he was preaching this though it wasn't at Jeffersonville he he said this several times that it was to the elect lady this message was invisible Union of the bride and uh he blessed a denominational ISM down there H they might not have received it for their day but the bride's going to receive it he was said he he was God has chosen elected lady which is his bride she is elected he said may I add to this woman Grace may I place her in the Bible also the elect lady she's called the elect lady Miss Grace I'm going to talk about the Bible declares to the elect lady that if you'll notice elect comes from the word elected lady one lady amongst all the other ladies was elected there's been churches churches Brides brides but there's coming one she's elected bride of Jesus Christ she's going to be bone of his bone flesh of his flesh life of his life word of his word she is in His image she is the word she is him made manifest on this Earth in feminine form Glory she has his name Mrs Jesus Christ she had a name change like Sarah had a name change Abraham had a name change the H got put into uh Abraham's name the H got put into his wife's name we call him Jesus we're called Mrs Jesus Christ we share a name change amen amen that's good all right he says don't feel bad now he had kind of don't feel bad now but these scriptures and so forth he says I'm speaking all to the country what I think is the elect lady and then he says here a little bit later he says now what happened here in marriage and divorce now you see what happened here he says the seals was open it brought it out the real truth of it so so he couldn't preach that before the seals he preached it after the seals and then a visible Union of the bride of Christ he had to preach that after that he had to come in succession he had a straighten out marriage and divorce before he could preach our our wedding ceremony about our invisible Union to our bridegroom that we couldn't come along bringing baggage from another marriage behind us spiritually speaking now I'm not talking about natural let your pastor straighten that out but we can't be dragging our denominational ideas in with us we can't be dragging our old nature in with us you can't be dragging I think we need to do this with us what did God say about it he's the husband that old husband's got to be dead that old Nature's got to be dead we can't hanging up for an occasion we can't put it aside and maybe I'll go back to it a little bit later if this doesn't work out there's people that's done that and look where they're at Judas for this day well I don't know if it's right I thought he told me he love me and I don't know if it's true Judas but you're you're you're called to overcome that nonsense and Tommy rot and trash he says the natural types the spirit I'm going have to fly through this we aren't you glad we're all astronauts you know we horse and buggy days we could kind of take it slow automobile age a little faster Pentecostal age with the plane that could take off and fly to Heights and go fast supersonic can't touch a rocket it's got a own an atmosphere built into it 1,700 miles an hour why if it gets down in the world atmosphere just start to burn up there's heat there's friction there yes sir friction between uh that that and the world it does it doesn't see the airplane it it stays in the world it it needs all that the rocket don't need that that's right oh that's why the Pentecostal are happy living in the the atmosphere of the world they don't mind that that's why the the other denominations and so forth they don't mind being Earthbound you don't want to put Wings on your your horse it's going to it's going to take you off a cliff or something it's not going to work good you don't want to put Wings on your car and strap a rocket booster to it it's not going to work right it doesn't have the mechanics right oh Hallelujah we got the Dynamics well you better also have the mechanics too or you're going to have a blow up somewhere along the road amen well you you got to have them both and you can have the best rocket ship in the world if it don't have the Dynamics it ain't going anywhere sitting on the launching pad it's going to be a big waste of money big waste of time it's going to be a spectacle yes sir for the wrong reason all right well all righty then but for the real thing if you got them both you can go in the heavenlies you can go to places that nobody else can find you and it's not even controlled by the pilots in there it's controlled by the control tower there there there's an unseen control that's guiding it to make sure it gets to its destination just right that's what we've got he's making sure we get to our destination just right everything's been pressurized everything's been tested by the world word of God the firep power's in there the Oxygen's in there you have everything need of for this for for to get you to your heavenly place when you give the baptism of the Holy Ghost on your soul you have everything in you that you need from here to there praise God I might get to the message tonight oh mercy alrighty a little fast here he says when they okay down through the ages people said that you look at the women natural it types of church and now when there come a time when the people were ready to line up to the word of God then a message comes forth and they line with it so why do you line up with the message because you're elected to do so he's going to have a bride that shows you who you are if you're lining up because something in you makes you want to line up to this message to the word of God for your day that shows that you're part of the Bride of Jesus Christ man you man doesn't want that the flesh wouldn't want that but there's a deep that calls into the deep there's something that's crying out Lord make me like you I see this I'm looking in the mirror of God's word I want it to reflect you Lord God wants you to express him God is expressing himself all right just like any son is in the attributes of his father you were in the genes of your father the body of your father when you were a young boy you were in him yet could not have fellowship with you because he didn't know you but then through the beding grounds of a mother you were brought forth into the Earth and become in the image of your father and then he could have fellowship with you amen all right the same way as it is in the natural so it is in the spiritual God his elected predestinated seed she had to come forth somewhere there had to be a betting grounds it had to be the Church of the Living God a virgin bride to bring forth children unto him to bring forth manifested Sons and Daughters of God to bring forth sons that and daughters that are born of the word with a word birth can't happen in a denomination and therefore as sure as your Gene had to be in your father before your natural birth your spiritual had Gene had to be in God because you're an expression of the attributes of his thoughts before the foundation of the world right no way around it now notice that life being in you God's life being in you from the foundation of the world he says now every generation he adds a new part to of his book so every part of the book had had a different part of the generations in there he says like my body was built started from the spine wasn't all spine went from ribs to ribs you know it went from cell to cell and it Formed an image and like down Through the Ages you could see well there's a part of it here part of it here but now in this time once it's done at the very end it it it represents what the seed life was it represents it's an Express image of the father and that's who you're supposed to be and that's who you are and express image of God in flesh tonight it didn't so much look like it in the developmental stages in the in Luther there was life and there might have been some kicking around sometimes and so forth but but now you're coming up into the stature of a perfect man yes amen so God wanted to express himself through his church amen thank you Jesus down Through the Ages he speak he types it out here with the the evolution and the different creatures and so forth God bringing up a man and then he says we have to skip a little bit for time all right yes sir all right let's get to the the title of the message here a sacred trust okay that was all kind of a foundation here here so what I want to talk to you about tonight is what God has given every one of us as a as a virgin bride to Christ he called a sacred trust some of us might have already known about this might have heard about it might have been do a wonderful thing maybe some people haven't heard about it maybe it we'd listen to it and passed it by but we need to know this it's important God wants us to know about these things he has given each one of us as individuals and as a church a and as a body of Christ worldwide a sacred trust then he types it out here with the woman so it's what we're going to read here for a minute a woman and think about the church too now the woman is entrusted with certain characters that she must not defile so is the church the church must not defile that he said a woman is trusted to that there's not a creature on earth like a woman no female dog no female any kind entrusted with the character that a woman is a woman was not even in the beginning of the creation because God know that she would fall all other me females could not commit adultery she's the only one that can commit adultery if she had been made in like the original it would have been disc complimentary to God's great wisdom see she was a byproduct of man but because she was cast over in that side she also has been given a sacred charge from God for Redemption praise the Lord man couldn't do it right oh my the sisters have got something on the Brothers here all right a sacred charge from God all right Pope can't do this preacher can't do this all right she's got characters she must not defile I said she's been given a sacred charge from God if she' Mar them she's defiled for a lifetime no matter how much she's forgiven she can't be justified I striking a little bit he says got a scripture on a few minutes she can be forgiven for defilement but she cannot be justified in this life always with her notice now she's been given this she may be forgiven but not justified think about the churches now every one of the daughters of the Roman Catholic church but were started off as virgins to the word they are pure they started with the word for their day but there came a time where they took another seed that wasn't the word of God and they denominated around the the seed idea word of a man and what happened they got defiled and and they brought forth other children other than Sons and Daughters of God they brought the forth the denominational members okay and they had to be put away for their defilement they could no longer come back to the word because they could not repent God says he gave her space to repent but she would not repent speaking of the Catholic church amen so you see that there now her body's given to her a sacred Trust From God no female dog no bird no other animal no creature like that the only one on the reason it's so sacred is because she's to bring forth life into the Earth her body is the betting grounds of life therefore the reason is she's given the sacred trust okay now what did I say what why are we talking about the woman here because she's a type of the church we see the immoral women where they are Revelation 17 and so forth and her daughters we see that but there's a real true genuine virtuous woman the Bride of Jesus Christ amen so where where there's a bad one where there's a bad Church there's a true bride that's a her husband is the word she will receive nothing from anyone else she won't even flirt with those things those things are dead to her praise God all right all right and we see Eve brought forth two twins Cain and Abel from different fathers all right her body is the bedding grounds therefore it's a sacred trust not to defile that I'm speaking now bring to this to an illustration to show you where the church stands not speaking of you women he say I'm speaking of the church and Christ she's given this the church now to bring forth life that only God himself can give her husband might be the germ Bearer but God has to produce the life that's that's right it has to come all life has to come from God all right what's that have to do with us well we're going to read here he said there's three things here that she must not get away from she has a sacred Trust of virtue committed to her by the Lord a certain virtue nothing else holds it but a woman that's committed to her by God she must not defile that virtue now he says the Womanhood I'm speaking of is her conduct her character around men okay yes all right he says if she does something wrong she must confess it to her husband before he takes her and makes it right the same as the church was married to the law also has to come before Christ before the second marriage she has to confess that if she doesn't and she lives with her husband for 10 years and confesses it he has a right to put her away and marry another woman the scripture said fornication unclean living Joseph fear not to take thee marry thy wife which is that which conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost he was minded to put her away put her away means divorce her privately seeing he was already engaged to her when you're engaged as to her as far as God is concerned you're married to her now she has a sacred Trust of virtue that's been given to her trusted to her by the Lord that gave her that virtue just as it was in The Garden Eden she can say yes or she can say no she has a sacred Trust of Womanhood committed to her that she must not break the Womanhood I'm speaking of here is her conduct her character around men not letting every man and then they goes on to say some other things here in a minute but what is this the church the bride of Christ has been given sacred trust she's been given a virtue that she must not defile that's right she's been given a character that she must not defile now I don't know what I'm you know this I'm speaking of spiritual things now I'm speaking of the church I I'm not speaking of whatever condition you might happen to be in don't let Satan try to put a cloud over you about the whatever that's I'm not not God forgave you he called you he brought you to the truth for a reason you don't let Satan talk you out of that God loves you he gave you his word for a reason he forgave you for a reason don't let Satan put put something in in front of you from receiving what God wants you to hear in this message amen you know oh he wants you to believe it all you shouldn't have to be afraid to play any of the tapes to read any part of the Bible don't let Satan talk to you and say God don't love you cuz you messed up here or there no he's a liar God's word is true and God had a reason for saving you God had a reason for giving you the Holy Ghost he had a reason for bringing you into this message that's why when when brother Brandon was preaching marriage and a divorce at the end what did he say don't I teach your children to never do those things again but he said go on as you are he said this was to the people that followed his message Grace was given by permission of the Lord God had a way to forgive those things amen okay and if you listen to that message too there's other things in there besides that and it what if you listen at it go back and listen to that sometime and look how God and his bride are together well and you'll see this too also in invisible ible Union of the Bride now this bride her she has a character like no other church has she has a conduct like no other church has okay she's not going to say she'll say yes to God and she'll say no to the things of the world she can turn down false Doctrine she doesn't have to to compromise on the word of God she doesn't have to compromise on every spirit that tries to come into the church and say and pet it so no you get you out of here you're not going to be in our home she's going to keep her home clean she's going to keep her heart clean before God she's not going to let it be defiled by the world if you listen to way of true Prophet lately it's a good one you know he's telling them people not to go down to the racetracks playing cards and stuff that's not for the bride you don't have any business going down to the car races and the RAC trcks and so forth you don't have any business down at the ball game Jes calling yourself a Christian you can hear that in enticing Spirits I don't make these things up but this is our message we we got to take it all we must not be defiled by the things of the world we must not be defiled by Hollywood we don't they might kiss and slop and live like ungodly adulterers and adulteresses out there but that's not for the bride of Christ she doesn't need to be slopping around around with false Doctrine with money making programs with with the things of the world no sir she's virtuous to him she doesn't need programs in the church to hold people she doesn't need to to build Sports Arenas and stuff to to hold people the gospel has not lost its attraction she's going to lift up Jesus Christ she's going to lift up this message which is Christ and that will draw every elected seed of God to him oh you can't run off the elected seat of God by preaching the message no sir you might run off the goats oh run off a sheep with the word how that's what they feed on right here here sheep here's some sheep food you know they're going they go to it the Shepherd that has the Sheep food they're not going to run away from them when they're hungry the goats might say oh I don't like that well okay all right so speaking of Hollywood here he said look on these screens the the movie stars kissing hugging slopping around around over these women a woman does that is a bad character she might be virtuous otherwise but seeing her heart sex glands are in the lips the man kisses a woman he's actually potentially committed adultery sex glands are in the woman's lips and in the man's lips he could kiss her on the hand it wouldn't mix through the sex glands but the sex glands are in the lips and all see all this nonsense of the Hollywood today all this slopping and loving around with women and so forth and little girls looking at that no wonder our morals are rotten decayed filthy see because it's put before the children so that's why the world is in the way it is today that's why the church world is in the way that it is today Hollywood now they got got rid of the tele well no they didn't get rid of the television they might have got the the movies out and then put the television in the house then they they renamed it to monitor then they brought it on their cell phone and still watching Hollywood Movies oh poisoning the minds of little girls when they see that Tommy right on there it defiles their mind the eye is the gateway to the soul okay I'm just trying I'm trying to hurry oh my all right we must guard what goes in these eyes we have a you know we we we our mind is the Battleground are you going to supply the devil with ammunition uhuh the soul is the control tower where God is when you've been baptized with the Holy Ghost this is your control tower this is where Satan chose and this is where the Battlefront is this is where the battle takes place this is where right God in your heart meet the wrong Satan and his thoughts that would bombard you his ideas that are contrary to the word that you're commanded to cast down cast down the reasoning cast down every imagination and high thought that exalts itself against God this is the Battle Ground it has to be a battle but you're called to win you're called to be Victor glorious you're called to be Overcomers in this age but you're going to have to fight you have to fight for every inch of ground to get it and you're going to have to fight to keep it but praise be to God you have been ordained to have the victory in Jesus Christ praise the Lord Jesus the only loser around here is the devil and Jesus is the winner man all right now speaking of Hollywood he said the church not the bride She's kissing and slopping mixing around and everything else but the word let the devil in education and scientific searches and so forth now he says scientific searches Google well what's the Bible say about this what's why are you looking up stuff on Google you're supposed to get your Revelation from God not scientific searches maybe that's why you're you're fighting more battles than you need to be oh my God didn't call you to look up every Tommy rot and idea that comes to your head on Google he called you to put your face in this book of the word of God he called you to be reading this message to listen to this message to believe this message and to live this message to redeem the time for the days are evil the days are evil redeem the time set your affections on the things that are above not on the things of this Earth You are not creatures of this time world you're called to a higher calling you are called as Eternal beings to live and express the Eternal God in this manner of time this small space of time we're going to leave here don't you can't take that the luggage of this world the baggage of this world with you drop

the kingdom of God praise the Lord he said the humble and the simple that's the celebrity that love God and believe his word that's the celebrity to Heaven that's who I want to be with that's who I want to be with I want to spend eternity with you that's right educational system is Antichrist you can't School Christ into people you can't school this message into people you can't take them down to the Seminary or the cemetery or the Camary and uh get Christ into him you can't you can't you can't force this message into somebody that's not seed it won't work we don't know who is and who isn't but if the word of God is out there it'll draw them you can't mix it up with some denominational idea and water it down watered down message didn't bring me in I saw watered down gospel out there it didn't work didn't work for me I needed a pure unadulterated message of the hour to bring me to a word birth and so does every seed of God you can't compromise on anything and expect to be prosperous in the spiritual things of God stay with the word I hope it's not as loud out there as it is up here is everybody okay out there okay I I if I go to death that's okay but I hope it's not to you God bless you all right I meant to ask about that earlier I'm sorry oh okay all right all right civilization we're going to have a civilization one day that will be far beyond anything that we can imagine we are Kings and Priests right now in this life in this earth Kings and Priests you've been called to that amen but also we're going to be that over there we can't even it hasn't really it can't enter our mind at this time what it's really going to be like we we know things the prophets told us we know things from the scripture but it's going to be greater than anything that we can imagine brother Brandon when he went beyond the curtain of time he couldn't even express with words oh it's beyond Sublime don't miss it only perfect love will enter therein oh friends love one another when John on the aisle of patmas he came back said friends love one another little children love one another when he had seen all the mysteries of the church ages and the seals and the Thunders oh when he saw God when he saw the 24 Elders he could have preached all the Revelation right there he could he could have told what the seals was but he really waser allowed to you had to seal him up but he could have what did he say love one another little children love one another when brother Brandon went beyond the current of time he said love one another whatever you do don't miss Divine love whatever you do don't miss it friends oh lay aside everything else until you have Divine love oh friends that you can love every sinner that you can love every hypocrite that you can love even your brothers and your sisters that you go to church with woo praise the Lord well that was free woo me oh my we love one another friends I might not if I don't get finished with this tonight love one another all right pray

you're called to do and you're called to overcome every Spirit of ungodliness over every Spirit of hatred and back Bing and bitterness you're called to overcome that as the bride of Christ you ordained to have Divine love working in your life when Divine love projects Sovereign Grace takes over you're called to that you're called to manifest it amen oh my sorry you haven't got there yet friends for the the message tonight here the sacred virtue the sacred Womanhood that's committed to her is is to honor her husband right now that's what the church is to do the bride is to do for Christ to honor his word above everything else above your family above your friends so-called above your job oh my we could go on that for a little while but we shouldn't let our job take away from God you know the Christ the mystery of God revealed he said you sometimes you let your wife take it out of you sometimes you let your job take it out of you friends we have been called to a sacred virtue a sacred trust to honor our husband Christ Christ Our Lord we must put him first don't let your job take it out of you don't let situations that rise up take out this Revelation or or or the joy of your salvation don't let it Rob you don't let it distract you from the things that God has in store for you Hallelujah he said just look today in certain cities many cities they have big parties all right under the husband all right he tells about this story here in in the big cities they had this was a 65 and it's a whole lot worse now big cities they had parties what they called Society church members two church members they called civilization so-called worse morals than every hot and tot and that that never heard the name of Jesus Christ he said they have big parties called Society church members they set their hat on the floor they get drunk pit your keys into it that woman picks it out with which husband she's going to live with for the week why would he mention that in invisible Union of the bride of Christ well I'll tell you why he says he says the answer I'm not called to interpret and figure it out he says the church is just bad and that's the church world now committing adultery with everything she has no business going into she should stay with the word it's no different that somebody wants to dial up these internet preachers and see what uh oh Joel ost's preaching this week they'll bring it to the pull pit it's not the word of God it's a seed of a man and then the next week they'll bring out something from John haggy they'll bring out something from uh TD Jake come on they'll bring out something from some denominational ISM so some dead aaran that's been killed and died and rotten on the vine and they'll bring it out in their Sunday school literature they'll bring it out in some false devotional that contrary to the word of God and it's a it's a different man every week because Christ has left out picture because he's been kicked out of the layot to seean church age but not so for the bride she's married to him she listens to his word she honors his word above all other things friends oh my but that's how God you say that's that's an awful story you shouldn't say it well he said it and that's God's opinion of the church world today ungodly ungodly no virtue he saw him dancing to the beat of rock and roll undressed ungodly rock and roll so why would we bring rock and roll into the church to worship God you can't do it and be right with God she went down over the into the bottomless eternity watch what Spirits you're entertaining be virtuous to Christ don't entertain rock and roll Devils by the music I don't care what the lyrics are there's Spirits behind everything you go you want some good inspired Holy Ghost songs Look in the Book of Psalms David played on the M the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want evil spirits were cast out of Saul that was before the Holy Ghost was given all right the church has gotten into building programs Hospital building programs educational programs those things are all right out there we have to live R to read and right economies but what happened it's not for the church she's been given a sacred trust that she must not break Womanhood to have her character to raise her children to be honorable to her husband and so is it with the church today she is supposed to create a atmosphere where children word born children can be born amongst her Lord not entertainment programs not building programs and all these other things oh my not politics oh that's long gone a long time ago probably when Abraham Lincoln went out all right sacred trust what a responsibility to the woman see why she's a type of the church all right she has the same responsibility as a woman has a sacred responsibility to Motherhood to virtues to her husband the church has a sacred responsibility to prayer and to the word and to Christ just the same as the woman has each one of us as individuals has a respon sacred responsibility friends it just say it's not just a duty it's a sacred thing that has been entrusted to us for prayer don't leave off pray don't leave it off in your home don't leave it off wherever you're at at your job don't leave it off when you get home before you go to bed all pray without ceasing friends it's a sacred trust that's has been given to you to pray without ceasing to pray a sacred responsibility for prayer and believe what you ask for you know not too many churches have prayer meetings anymore I don't like to say that but it's true a lot of preachers will preach on prayer meetings but that you never have them in the church oh we used to have prayer meetings well what happened have a prayer meeting watch what God can do it was in the house of uh oh my we we don't read the book of Acts and see what prayer did okay to say that for time but it how did they get called to the mission field and how did the Holy Ghost speak it was during when the saints assembled themselves together and prayed separate me Paul and Barnabas for the work I have called unto them to do and so on and so forth God speaks in pray he uses prayer meetings in the church I've heard people scoff that why do I got to come to church I pray home well you do that that attitude will hinder the service anyway but God can move in that God can move in your home God can move in your car he can move that when you pray your prayers will shake hell your prayers can shake heaven God would bankrupt Heaven before he would fail to answer one prayer hallelujah oh friends he cannot fail at his word oh he loves you so much friend and he isn't he's given you the sacred trust the sacred charge to prayer he has given us a sacred charge to the word of God not to mix it up with my ideas or your ideas or anybody else's ideas amen oh not to mix it not to compromise one by one iota not to oh say this doesn't matter but this does we don't need this quote anymore it's too oldfashioned we don't need this cuz it's too strict oh that's legalism well they call that to brother brandom didn't they they said oh old Bill brandom he does more harm than he does good he's nothing better than old legalist he's always balling out the women yeah that's what they thought about him Pentecostal Church did but not the bride she not she she'll say what he said she doesn't have another message to preach but what was given to her that's right oh Esther was given a sacred trust to the king and she she put full confidence in her Messenger to only dress herself with what was given her by that messenger so with the bride of Christ only dress herself in the revelation of this hour of the word of God the wedding garment the baptism of the Holy Ghost she's not going to try to put on something else to to impress him like well I think he'll like this little extra thing that I do no sir get that junk out of your life you can't improve the message it's already perfect Christ is already perfect praise the Lord God hallelujah oh by oh you you can't make it better cuz it's already the best am responsibility to prayer to the word and to Christ he also says the Holy Ghost it's our responsibility as a body of Christ to keep the holy ghost moving in the church Hallelujah okay so that people can be birthed by the word of God the preaching of the word could cast out evil spirits you can receive your healing by the preaching of the word am true friends it's a sacred truth trust to to not to come to church all tired and beat down I know I know the evening service is harder our flesh gets quick I'm not condemning anybody okay I I'm but but we that's something we got to watch out for because this is our enemy this is our greatest enemy right here these 16 elements of My Flesh is mine and yours is yours we've got to watch those things we've got to be careful for that we must enter and realize what God has given us to the sacred trust to come with expectation that God is going to move amongst his people that we welcome W with the musicians as they play with the preaching of the word that that that he gets himself out of the way that God can speak that God can have the the Holy Ghost can have preeminence in the service we don't want to run out the move of the Holy Ghost friends we don't want to oh friends we we must not do that it's a sacred trust God doesn't want us to be cold and formal and he doesn't want us to be lukewarm that's the curse of the age is lukewarmness to to J jump and shout and live like the devil brother brandom said don't jump any higher than you live and then you got people on the other side that's cold formal and intellectual what do they do oh that's ner nothing to well friends yes the Holy Ghost brings emotion emotion's not the Holy Ghost amen if your experience doesn't take you back to the word the message of the day you leave that alone and get the real thing the heavens is full of the real don't settle for anything less than they received on the day of Pentecost oh my the church world has gone off an Institutional programs building programs in school he said they serve their purpose but Jesus didn't say that he said preach the word he didn't say go make schools he said that's where they neglect it they make these things it's not the church's Duty the I'm I'm paraphrasing a little bit here too to save time the church duty is to preach the gospel now we know teaching is word of the word that's that's part of the the thing but preaching the gospel is demonstration of the word it's through the demonstration of the word of God for example they hands on the sick and they shall recover you do it after you know anybody needs lay hand okay we do that the sick are healed devils are cast out so on so forth lives are changed okay demonstration of the word in action through vessels all right that's the duty of the churches to preach the gospel he we've done everything else but that and we drifted in just like Satan did to mix it up with some gospel something else something else tell it's a collaboration of nothing speaking of the church world now don't don't never do that Satan came into them and and it worked for them for the Pentecostal age just like it worked for vashy when she said I got my gifts I I got my my my church association with all the other women maybe they was women preachers or something I don't know but but they was type of the church women's type of the church and she had her women's Society no head around anywhere and she was retreated from the word the king and and what she said I I'm sufficient in myself just like the Catholic Church said uh uh you know the scripture there most of you do but what is it it's a type there she didn't have need of the word God put her away and chose Esther God put Pentecost away he chose the bride he did so Satan came in and said you don't really need all that word like that so Satan how he came in there at Pentecost the same Temptation the same tactic he's going to try but it won't be successful in this bride she won't take anything else but the word of God she's overcome this world she's overcome denominationalism amen and at some point in your life Satan will tempt you one way or the other you with with these things God will allow it because he has confidence in you that you will over overcome it all right the Temptation the decision where Pentecost said yes or no and she took that other thing in the same thing will come around the message the bride will not fall to that she won't let that in her life amen she can be tempted by it though all right prise God all right we cannot be married to these other things and to the word Christ at the same time or the Bible speaks of spiritual adultery we don't want to be guilty of that we've been given a sacred charge to hold the word of God true to our heart and to not even flirt with the things of the world I'm going have to skip a lot you can listen to brother brandom there invisible Union of the Bride if you want want to catch the rest of the story oh my the church world she wasn't true to him she she's still married to her first nature she's doing the works in herself without Christ because she put Christ outside of the church she's doing her own programs her own things her boasting her own accomplishments but not the bride she boasts on him alone she's bringing forth children because in her not the bride the the church world is bringing forth some sort of children she's pregnated with something she's bringing forth church members but why are they they're illegitimate why because she's living in adultery to the word of God he says illegitimate to what not to the church but to the word she's illegitimate it's a picture of Revelation three the last day they ought to see a church age a little what an illegitimate group denominational mixup work lukewarm carry on call themselves Christians and not the word of God having a form of godlin but denying the power thereof as the prophet said they would be okay she wants want to be married to her first husband and look at her nature she loves the world she says she's married to Christ but her her Works prove she's married to something else Satan it's strong but it's true the first husband our first Nature by our first birth must be dead to receive the Holy Ghost you must die out to your old first nature you cannot carry it on and say I'm going to patch me up I'm going to be a better me that's nonsense it won't work it'll fail every time all right amen we are commissioned to bring forth children word born children of God it can only come forth by this messag amen that's why brother Sean preaches the message of God it don't bring in other stuff it won't bring forth word birth might bring forth church members but it'll bring forth a lot of spirits but the word will bring forth the Holy Ghost every time thank you Jesus okay we can't hyb it brother brandom tells about women going into menopause at the age of 20 and 25 years old old why did he tell that he says that's what the church is also in its condition what did he say happened it was because of hybrid food was causing women not to be able to bring forth children hybrid food had done that in the natural so is it in the spiritual the Pentecostal hybrid the food if you try to hybrid this message you'll have dead church members you cannot bring forth a word birth with a hybrid seed you cannot bring forth a word birth with a watered down gospel you can't mix this message with Pentecostalism you can't Mi no I don't mean original Pentecostal mean denominationalism all right you can't mix it with Oneness ideas you can't mix it with Trinity ideas Tess whatever you can't mix it with Baptist you can't mix it with NE Methodist or Calvinism or Armenian ISM you got to you got to take a message for what it is it won't bring forth children you'll die if you do that don't hyb it oh the the church has given that trust to not H breed it to honor her words Lord above every man-made Creed to stay virtuous to her husband see they they got away from it but she's still responsible for it I'm responsible for it you're responsible for it is this okay to preach here okay he said look what the Hollywood has done robbed her of Her Sacred virtues that's what she done to the church she's I got to have these Hollywood preachers to come in and oh my that's the church World they have to have their teeth 15 shaders of white whiter than they need to be artificial the women we preachers will have their makeup on and the the men do too sometimes for their photo shoot for their book for they're going to sell millions of fake put on the gospel is genuine it glows with the humility of Christ the church world has been deceived by television magazine people and all these things else find things that that they've got going on out the the street so she call Modern girls they look at the magazines they look at the pictures pictures in the magazines nowadays they look at Instagram they look at Facebook Tik Tock and it's poisoning their minds get that junk away from your children they brought Disney and Hollywood into the house and you can watch a cartoon that's voiced over by some devils lesbians and you're letting that in your living room and the babysit your kids and you wonder why they come up with bangs down in their face perverted Spirits coming along yes sir don't you kick that junk out you ought to be P that oh that's why they have to wear their dress above their knees because they've been looking at the wrong thing they've been enticed by enticing spirits of the devil they're not honoring their sacred virtue now friends the prophet of God saw the bride Marching In the vision and that last little bit of group she was out of line she got her eyes on something else she got her eyes off of the message she got her she's still the bride but what did he say get back in line am what what does the fivefold ministry say now get back in line that's right if you're not in line get back in line the bride will she'll get back in line just because she was out of Step didn't mean she wasn't bride but if she is bride she'll get back in line and the and the and the ministry that's anointed of this day will say what the prophet of God said and get back in line will oh the we understand it's just a phase yeah it's called sin you need to be born again God understands why I have to look pornography and and lost after this and that and the other and and I got to take a social drink once while yeah he understands you need to be born again because you don't have the Holy Ghost repent ye okay oh he understands why I got to put a little bit of makeup on cuz you don't have the Holy Ghost you got to Jezebel spirit on you that's overtook you get back in line okay praise the lord we we could stay on that but uh you hear the message like I do okay oh my the devil was a subtle person that walked into the Garden of Eden and he walked into the church okay you are called to stand above these things you are called to be Overcomers of these things you are called to be victorious more than conquerors over every all these Spirits if you're struggling with something God has called you to be an overcomer he's called you to lay aside amen your life and present it to him for a Living Sacrifice put your life on the altar die out to yourself your ideas your ambition let Christ live in you he'll change your mind he'll change your appetite he'll change your desires hallelujah oh yes I no he did it for me he's done it for a lot of you oh oh he's the same yesterday today and forever I'm going to oh mercy okay he said the church world the women will practice birth control because they're worried about being deformed why did he say about that because the church she doesn't want to bring forth members Holy Ghost born members because it'll deform her standing with the organization it'll deform her culture classical ways it'll deform what she's made herself to be because she doesn't want to move of the Holy Ghost in the church woo she don't she won't look like she used to when a woman gives birth she won't look like she used to and when the church brings forth word born children of God they won't look like they used to either hallelujah oh I'm so glad I don't look like I used to and I know you're glad that you don't look like you used to oh my he's the same yesterday today and forever I'll skip I'm just going to hit some highlights and I'm going try harder than ever to quit but she still got a mother something friends she's got a nature that she wants to Mother something that's why she brings in the programs in the church that's why she want she's got to do something to keep her busy to keep her occupied that's why a woman would take a dog in oh my that's my baby that's my granddog where's this nonsense from Friends Prophet God called that Tommy right out B she despise having children you have how many kids oh how do you stand it that's the spirit of the devil and people this day of this world that's the thought of the world you had a holy ghost meeting oh my everybody shouted wo I don't want none of that yeah they'll get religious about hating on that cuz they're full of the devil woo oh my oh he said the old bear I've seen four Bears on the interstate brother amen I said God bless brother Amos they're dead all right two last two weeks all kinds of bears everywhere but if the old bear she doesn't have her cub what so there's an instinct in her she wants to Mother something she'll go back and hunt those ones up if their breeding didn't take okay she'll hunt them up all and then she it's her god-given instinct to Mother something okay then he says about the church here the the and the people the women of this Modern Age worldly women they don't want to have a baby for their husband but they'll take a cat or a dog they've got a mother something but to Bear a child for her husband to take it to the service of God is entirely out of line people shack up don't want to bring forth kids even people in church say well that's the too cruel of a world to bring for children nowadays that's the spirit of the devil friends God said be fruitful and multiply don't take that Tommy rod in the world's always been a horrible place ever since the Garden of Eden when the fall came and sin came in God's telling them to be fruit and multiply to bring forth replenish the Earth Noah he didn't say well it's just too bad we'll just hunker down and die until no that's nonsense that's of the devil all right that's free too because that wasn't really written down there in the notes okay but what it what happens to raise it to the surface of God is entirely out of line for these modern women so is it for the church today he says neither does a church want any of these hear screaming shouting tongue speaking Act 2 238 young around her she don't want any of them whooping or crying or Screaming amen hallelujah why it didn't immediately put her out of her denomination they had one like that in one of the churches they'd throw her out right quick why are you letting such stuff as this go along remember they said amen and and they all turned their necks like what was that oh well you see she's pregnated with something cuz she's bringing forth members all the time but she don't want none of them screaming hollering labin acts 238 miserable creatures that she thinks they are it would certainly embarrass her she's more concerned about her image to the public and how they can fly the rainbow Flags well they're going to burn with them if they're that's what Romans 1 says all those that tolerate with them that's not the exact words but those have pleasure in them that do them knowing the Judgment of God that they which commit such things are worthy of death not only to do the same but have pleasure in them that do them amen there's a church down here in blackburg they have rainbow Flags oh yeah it's ready for the burning it's the Church of Sodom might as well change her name and get Martin Luther's name off of there he didn't put up with that junk okay hey any of them welcome to come and get their heart right with God they can come as they are but they don't have to stay as they are they don't have to bring their perverted spirits and keep them and hang on to them and pervert your young kids and you watch who your kids hang out with there Spirits out there friends I don't care if they're religious they might be full of the devil they might be a Ricky or an Elvis or or uh an Oswald you watch who they hang out with watch what Spirits are packing I don't care what church they go from oh my Lord help me all right it would ruin her e ethical scientific Society they call evil good and they call good evil this world does their form of Ethics is tolerance for everybody except for Christians well and they couldn't have the Holy Ghost in there because it drive the Devils out the preachers would be fired the deacons would be fired the You' have an empty church there may be brother B said there be many blank sermons preaching up against the wall all right he said she don't want to be pregnated with the word because that's the only kind of the word that the word can bring forth all right not the scientific but the other you know he says you find what is the what you he said you don't find that in the word of God Church joining Creed going Bob Harry he says what you find is oldfashioned Sanctified Holy Ghost filled child born of the spirit of God screaming hollering shouting praising God we can't leave off sanctification but we can't stop there either friends the Holy Ghost is if if you you say you've got the Holy Ghost and you're still Walling in the things of the world and you think you can bypass sanctify ation you got you you you you missed the road stop friends oh my well that's too oldfashioned not for God cuz God's old fashioned oh the Holy Ghost filled stuff well it's for the children of God only the elect can be reborn only the seed of God can reborn because in the the non-elect there's nothing to Quicken all right what's what church World bring forth painted face short wear and Jezebel illegitimate cats all right watch her lover watch what she loves it show shows who she's in love with the bride who's she in love with she's in love with Jesus Christ that's her husband her fruits proves what she is her fruits proves what she is and their fruits prove what they are all right she claims to be born the second time to Christ but notice who her lover is Adam because she loves the world tell tell her it tells what their papa is whether it's first Adam or second Adam if the church brings forth the child of second Adam he asks the second Adam's way of acting like they did on the day of Pentecost their nature is like his and hers they told him that he said you say shut up on that so he had a rough way to go to preach that he had to preach lamb and the dove he said the message got through okay the denominational Creed Seekers Cain like were illegitimate to the word as Cain was yes now we we are getting ready to close almost all right the church across the nation following Jesus Christ the word to be in the bride you have to be remarried to the word of God which is a Christ as long as you're holding man's tradition of denominations you're called in God's word and adulterous now we've all come out from that he said come out over my people be not partakers of our sins all right I thank God that that he's called us out and that we walked out that's is what we've walked out from thank God why so we could re represent Jesus Christ to this dying world that's right the seed of God cannot be in him the same time the love of God and the love of the world is in there the seat of God is operating through you that's the word of God the love of the world can't be in there at the same time neither can you bear sons of God God's sons of his word to this illegitimate denominational group you cannot do it it's an incubator you canot bring forth a son word a word Son of God speaking to the church what they failed to keep the word they failed to have the Revelation he speaks of the adultery that happened there in the garden and he talks about the serpent seed and he says when the seals were open it declared it and proved it he says both trees are coming to the seed and pro proving thems elves so the church world is going to do what they're going to do as the musicians would come we're going to close a little faster than maybe you thought all right all right I give you time to get up here too I'll preach a little slow coming in for a landing hope we hit some Heavenly places tonight all right the Seven Seals opened and declared it improved it both trees are coming to the seed there's a True Vine and there's a false Vine the message of the hour was to the churches the message unto the church let me turn to it here since we got time here we'll be ready here brother well it was to the True Vine and the false Vine the True Vine would heard it the True Vine listened to it the True Vine obeyed it the false Vine put it out because they didn't want nothing to do with it and here we are right today Le oysa and the bride Le osia is all around us we've been called into the bright age we've been lifted into Heavenly places we are not creatures of time but we're creatures of Eternity okay time Le to see is part of time we've been translated into eternity here these are still in time they shall be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye friends the trees are going to prove who they are there's going to be a Rapture Showdown friends right here today Le osia and the Leota will serve the world Leota won't keep her sacred trust to the word to Christ no they won't do it but the bride will the bride will keep her Savor in trust prayer so if I can leave you with something tonight friends love one another pray without ceasing put God's word above your pride put God's word above your problems testify make things right with one another love one another friends oh we got to love one another preachers love one another preachers love the other preachers from the other churches work together as one unit one body of Christ you know brother brandom said in the brandham Tabernacle he said they sure have their differences but he said they're more in unity than anybody knew of and they he said they but they got their differences you can have differences and still be in unity okay and what they he's and what happened you listen to the message there he's preaching he said what happened the seven six dreams in the seventh Vision to confirm there right before the opening of the seals what it was going to be he said there were still differences among them but there was Unity among them we might have different ideas but we're all going to the same place that Unity to the stature of the fullness of stature of a perfect man if if we were already perfect we wouldn't be here I got things that still need to be taken off of me okay the word of God is a cutting word it's this is the age of the stone Mason we're not piling up church members and filling up pews it's the age of the honing of The Cutting to fit them into the body of Christ where they belong and it gets narrow as it gets to the top stay with your sacred trust stay with the word pray and read your Bible get deeper in the love of God stay true to his word stay true to prayer time don't give it up for anything else friends stay true to worshiping God in truth and Spirit to welcome his presence search your life every day and and see if there there' be anything in you that wouldn't be pleasing to the Lord we're to judge ourselves friends when we read the word of God keep the sacred trust that God has given you God bless you let's let's pray Lord we love you Lord Jesus we pray God that you bless your people father Lord if there any one that would have any sin
