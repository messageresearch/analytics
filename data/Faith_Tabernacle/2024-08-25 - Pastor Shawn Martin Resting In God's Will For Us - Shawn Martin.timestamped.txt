[54:33] ask it in Jesus Christ's name and the
[54:37] church
[54:38] says
[54:40] amen um Isaiah the 6th chapter we're
[54:42] going to start at the first
[54:45] verse says in the year that King Uzziah
[54:49] died I saw also the
[54:52] Lord um sitting upon a throne high and
[54:56] lifted up and his train filled the
[54:59] temple above it stood the
[55:01] seraphim each one had six wings with
[55:04] Twain he covered his face and with Twain
[55:06] he covered his feet and with Twain he
[55:08] did
[55:10] fly and one Cried unto another and said
[55:13] holy holy holy is the Lord of hosts the
[55:16] whole earth is full of his glory and the
[55:20] post of the door moved at the voice of
[55:22] him that cried and the house was filled
[55:25] with smoke
[55:27] then said I woe is me for I am undone
[55:30] because I am a man of unclean lips and I
[55:34] dwell in the midst of of a people of
[55:38] unclean lips for my eyes have seen the
[55:41] king of the king the Lord of hosts then
[55:45] flew one of the seraphim unto me having
[55:47] a live coal in his hand which he had
[55:50] taken with the tongues uh from off the
[55:54] Altar and he laid it upon my mouth and
[55:56] said Lo this hath touched thy lips and
[55:59] thine iniquity is taken away and thy sin
[56:02] is purged also I heard the voice of the
[56:05] Lord saying whom shall I send and who
[56:10] will go for us then said I here am I
[56:14] send me then if you'll turn to the Book
[56:17] of
[56:19] Job the 23rd chapter
[56:29] Job chapter
[56:31] 23 we're going to start at the first
[56:36] verse then job answered and said even
[56:40] today is my complaint
[56:43] bitter my stroke is heavier than my
[56:46] groaning oh that I knew where I might
[56:49] find him that I might come even to his
[56:53] seat I would order my call before him
[56:57] and fill my mouth with
[56:59] arguments I would know the words which
[57:02] he would answer me and understand what
[57:05] he would say unto me will he plead
[57:08] against me with his great power no but
[57:12] he would put strength in me there the
[57:16] righteous might dispute with him so
[57:20] should I be delivered forever from my
[57:25] judge behold I go forward but he is not
[57:29] there and backward but I cannot perceive
[57:32] him on the left hand where he doth work
[57:37] but I cannot Behold Him He hideth
[57:40] himself on the right hand so that I
[57:43] cannot see him but everybody say but he
[57:48] knoweth the way that I take when Heath
[57:52] tried me I shall come forth and as gold
[57:57] amen you can have your seats and we also
[58:00] want to keep brother Tim in our prayer
[58:03] he had to go to North Carolina this
[58:07] weekend and be traveling back today and
[58:11] so may God just give him safe traveling
[58:17] Mercy amen today I really don't have
[58:22] much to um say I don't
[58:27] guess
[58:29] um it's just going to be a simple
[58:31] thought and um I want to talk about God
[58:36] resting in God's will for
[58:39] us and I pray that'll be of some help uh
[58:45] to
[58:46] you uh God's will can be difficult at
[58:51] times and in doing it um can be a
[58:57] challenge um and so it's not always
[59:02] glamorous and it sometimes uh to be
[59:06] honest it leaves us scratching our heads
[59:09] as to what God is
[59:12] doing and um and you know and but but
[59:16] one thing that we must not ever do and
[59:20] we must not accuse God of being
[59:23] foolish uh in his will for our lives or
[59:27] for any other uh there uh God knows what
[59:32] he's doing and and the Bible would tell
[59:35] us that God's judgments are
[59:39] unsearchable and his ways pass finding
[59:43] out and so God is the we we'd call him
[59:47] the sculptor we'd call him the artist we
[59:50] would call him the Potter we would call
[59:54] him whatever but
[59:56] it it just shows that he is Sovereign in
[59:59] what he's doing he has a plan he has a
[1:00:03] will and when he's done we can look at
[1:00:06] the picture and know that it was God
[1:00:09] that done it and it' be
[1:00:12] perfect and so
[1:00:15] um I believe our opening scriptures are
[1:00:18] applicable for us in this day and uh we
[1:00:22] can relate to to both of the scriptures
[1:00:27] uh and and by these scriptures we see
[1:00:29] the uh two ends of the spectrum I I
[1:00:32] guess if we could call it that and one
[1:00:36] is being sent with the commission he
[1:00:38] just come from the presence of the Lord
[1:00:41] and um that must have been a significant
[1:00:44] time in in Isaiah's life and and to um
[1:00:50] uh what what I mean what what an
[1:00:52] encouragement you know uh to come from
[1:00:54] the presence of the Lord
[1:00:56] and to experience what he experienced
[1:00:59] and then now the Lord is sending him
[1:01:01] forth with a
[1:01:03] commission and uh uh you know that that
[1:01:07] that would have been been great and then
[1:01:09] then of course the the other uh one that
[1:01:13] we see is is uh being being tried as by
[1:01:18] fire and he he don't know where God is
[1:01:22] he's trying to find God and he like to
[1:01:25] talk with God and God talked back with
[1:01:28] him but it just seemed like God's
[1:01:31] disappeared and uh but we we understand
[1:01:35] why and that is because that job was
[1:01:39] going through something job was going
[1:01:42] through a trial and job would say that
[1:01:45] that he has tried me though he tries me
[1:01:47] I will come forth as gold but but one
[1:01:51] thing that job would tell us is that he
[1:01:54] never lost his faith he never lost his
[1:01:57] confidence and his his faith in God at
[1:02:01] that time was he knoweth the way that I
[1:02:04] have taken in other words I'm not being
[1:02:07] deserted even though I I can't he seems
[1:02:10] far from me it seems like you know that
[1:02:14] he he doesn't understand where I'm at
[1:02:16] and and all these things but he knoweth
[1:02:18] the way that I take uh of of course
[1:02:22] because God is the one that allowed that
[1:02:24] way God is allowed that direction for
[1:02:27] for his life and and so believe it or
[1:02:31] not both you know Believers uh uh in
[1:02:34] this day uh experience both ends of the
[1:02:38] spectrum uh for the Old Testament was
[1:02:41] types and shadows of the
[1:02:43] new and and and Isaiah is a type of the
[1:02:47] believer coming under the influence of
[1:02:50] God's presence and humbling himself and
[1:02:55] being changed changed and and and then
[1:02:57] being sent and and and see so so God
[1:03:02] sends us God sends a man to fulfill his
[1:03:07] will right he he sends a man to fulfill
[1:03:10] his will and so this is why every man
[1:03:14] woman boy girl that that uh uh is to
[1:03:18] fulfill the will of God then they first
[1:03:20] must come under the influence of God and
[1:03:24] and then hum
[1:03:26] themselves uh uh before uh their sin uh
[1:03:31] because to fulfill the commission that
[1:03:34] God gives us and and and and to be
[1:03:37] honest you know
[1:03:40] as we all as as Believers we understand
[1:03:44] that we're the bride of Christ and we
[1:03:46] understand that we are a word bride we
[1:03:49] understand that everything that that God
[1:03:51] does with us and and commissions us and
[1:03:54] and all that must be in the confines of
[1:03:57] of the word of God it it must be there
[1:04:00] but yet God God commissions us in a
[1:04:03] personal way and and and gives us
[1:04:06] certain tasks certain uh uh things that
[1:04:09] we do to to to to fulfill his will for
[1:04:14] our personal lives but in in all reality
[1:04:17] it's an edification to the whole body of
[1:04:20] of Jesus Christ and and so uh when we
[1:04:24] look at that then
[1:04:26] then
[1:04:27] then we we've got to first come under
[1:04:30] the influence of God and and when a man
[1:04:33] comes under that influence in the
[1:04:36] presence of God then then he
[1:04:38] automatically does exactly what Isaiah
[1:04:40] done for Isaiah is the type of the
[1:04:43] believer uh uh and and that is to Humble
[1:04:47] to Humble ourselves and not look at
[1:04:49] anything else that is great but but
[1:04:52] you're looking at the one that is great
[1:04:54] and that is God and and you come under
[1:04:57] that that presence you humble yourselves
[1:04:59] and and you become changed and then God
[1:05:02] sends us and and so uh uh for us to
[1:05:06] fulfill the commission that God gives us
[1:05:11] then we first have to accept the will of
[1:05:14] God we first have to come and and and
[1:05:17] this is why we must come into the
[1:05:18] presence of God to to realize that God
[1:05:21] is on the throne that that God knows
[1:05:24] exactly what he's doing and and that
[1:05:27] that there there is nothing that can
[1:05:29] Dethrone him and and so that when he
[1:05:32] makes a decision he makes it with an
[1:05:34] ultimate goal with an ultimate decision
[1:05:37] it it it's someone that is superior that
[1:05:40] no one is binding him no one is is
[1:05:42] making him it it's from his own
[1:05:47] sovereignty and and so we we find that
[1:05:50] job also is a type of the believer that
[1:05:53] is tested and tried and so
[1:05:56] and and and we find that God does both
[1:05:58] he he he commissions us he sends us out
[1:06:03] but he
[1:06:04] also uh uh tries us and he and he and he
[1:06:09] molds us and he shapes us can you say
[1:06:12] amen and and and so God has a purpose
[1:06:15] for all things I am amazed that God
[1:06:18] would choose and send people like us to
[1:06:21] fulfill his purpose on Earth I I really
[1:06:24] am uh of uh we we all of our hangups and
[1:06:27] discouragements our ups and downs and
[1:06:30] and you know and and so uh uh it it
[1:06:34] really is is amazing that God would take
[1:06:38] us and and and commission us and every
[1:06:41] every woman boy girl man that is a part
[1:06:44] of the body of Christ you have a
[1:06:46] commission God God sends you God places
[1:06:50] you in that body for a purpose and and
[1:06:53] so you're not just to to float around
[1:06:56] that's not exactly what God has called
[1:06:59] us to do if we're part of the body can
[1:07:02] you say amen he sends us out to fulfill
[1:07:05] the commission which is his will for our
[1:07:08] lives and and we've got to fulfill that
[1:07:11] now this this sounds really exciting to
[1:07:13] do something for God I think if I would
[1:07:16] ask uh you know for for a show of hands
[1:07:20] of who wants to do something for the
[1:07:21] Lord I think most of us would say yeah I
[1:07:24] I'd want to and and and and of course in
[1:07:27] thinking of this we think of Glamour we
[1:07:29] think of wow this is going to be really
[1:07:31] you know something to be used of God you
[1:07:33] know and and maybe we would think it as
[1:07:36] as the president you know or Trump
[1:07:39] calling you personally and saying hey
[1:07:41] would you help me in my campaign and and
[1:07:43] man now that would be a I'm sure we
[1:07:46] would all consider that to be an honor
[1:07:48] and and whether you choose that or not
[1:07:50] brother bill says no but but we we
[1:07:53] whether we choose that or not and we'd
[1:07:56] probably go to friends and we'd call
[1:07:57] them up and say Hey you know uh uh
[1:08:00] president Trump just called me asking
[1:08:02] for me to help you know and uh can you
[1:08:06] believe that you know I'm working at
[1:08:08] whatever McDonald's and all that but he
[1:08:10] wants my help I mean his whole career
[1:08:13] depends upon this and he's asking for me
[1:08:16] you know and and well you know whether
[1:08:18] you get excited about that or not but I
[1:08:21] think it would be an honor if God would
[1:08:24] choose us and God would call us and and
[1:08:28] say would you help me in my kingdom and
[1:08:32] I don't know but I think you know if you
[1:08:35] got that personal call that God somehow
[1:08:38] personally comes to you whether it's a
[1:08:39] pillar of fire an angel or or whatever
[1:08:43] and he comes down and says hey you know
[1:08:46] um
[1:08:47] uh I'd like for you to help me out you
[1:08:50] know and and and well you know what well
[1:08:54] but God has done that
[1:08:56] God God has he he he has us uh to help
[1:09:00] him in you know in in in his kingdom how
[1:09:04] many believes that and and so that that
[1:09:07] is something to be excited about that
[1:09:10] the god of Heaven which chuse us in our
[1:09:13] in our Humanity to help him further his
[1:09:17] kingdom and when when he could have
[1:09:19] called the son to preach the gospel and
[1:09:21] yet he chose men to do that he he he
[1:09:23] could have called all kinds of things to
[1:09:26] to further his kingdom but he chose us
[1:09:28] to do that and and and so so and and and
[1:09:32] and exciting it may be yet it is our
[1:09:36] responsibility because we're not waiting
[1:09:38] as though God you know needs to come in
[1:09:42] the form of a pillar of fire or in the
[1:09:44] form of a body uh uh to talk to us and
[1:09:47] personally ask us I I think he has done
[1:09:51] that when he saves us and when he uh uh
[1:09:54] uh redeemed us and he filled us with the
[1:09:56] Holy Ghost then then there's something
[1:09:59] that he put within us to want to do
[1:10:01] something for God he do you believe that
[1:10:05] and and and yet and and so it is our
[1:10:08] responsibility to fulfill this
[1:10:11] commission amen I I you know when I I
[1:10:15] felt you know uh when I really began to
[1:10:17] get serious about the Lord and and uh
[1:10:21] things I I began to feel this call uh to
[1:10:24] preach you know well you know I was you
[1:10:27] know nobody I I still am a nobody I but
[1:10:30] I didn't sing in church like Wendell and
[1:10:32] Lena did and of course Jonathan was too
[1:10:35] young and and at that time but um but
[1:10:38] they were the singers they were being
[1:10:40] used they were the ones that everybody
[1:10:42] adored and you know looked up as the
[1:10:44] icon of the church and for the young
[1:10:46] people I wasn't that that's for sure and
[1:10:50] and so you know but but I I remember
[1:10:53] just feeling that that that I you know
[1:10:56] God's called me to to preach you know
[1:10:58] and I was ashamed to even say it you
[1:11:00] know and and so I I finally told Dad and
[1:11:04] he well that's good you know we just
[1:11:06] pray about it and things but you know I
[1:11:08] never was called upon to do anything and
[1:11:10] but I told the Lord Lord I'll do it if
[1:11:12] you want me to do it you know and I
[1:11:14] don't even know where to begin don't
[1:11:16] even know how but here I am
[1:11:18] today with that being said um that that
[1:11:23] that sounded great to to do something
[1:11:25] for the Lord I really did want to do
[1:11:26] something for God uh but I had no idea
[1:11:30] what that would entail and probably if I
[1:11:34] knew what that entailed I probably
[1:11:36] wouldn't have I said uhuh no sir re Bob
[1:11:38] you know and I'd be skidding on the
[1:11:41] break you know putting on the brakes and
[1:11:43] and uh doing something else but uh uh
[1:11:49] regardless we find out it's a
[1:11:52] responsibility do you believe that amen
[1:11:55] it's a responsibility to do to to that
[1:11:58] we have to fulfill the commission so
[1:12:01] whether I want to do it or not I've got
[1:12:03] a obligation I've got a duty to
[1:12:06] fulfill uh uh the will of God and and
[1:12:10] and my obligation and my duty my
[1:12:14] responsibility is to God and him alone I
[1:12:17] I don't answer to no one I I've got to
[1:12:20] answer to God for for what he has called
[1:12:24] me to do
[1:12:25] do you believe that see and so Corinth 1
[1:12:28] Corinthians 6:19 what know ye not that
[1:12:32] your body is the Temple of the Holy
[1:12:33] Ghost which is in you which you have of
[1:12:35] God and you are not your own for you are
[1:12:37] bought with the price therefore glorify
[1:12:40] God in your body and in your spirit
[1:12:43] which are Gods ain't that right so we
[1:12:45] will answer only to God Amen not no one
[1:12:49] else and and and and it's the god that
[1:12:52] we will answer and it's the god that
[1:12:54] that
[1:12:55] uh we owe everything too ain't that
[1:12:58] right so when we think of that though
[1:13:00] when we think of of wow you know that
[1:13:02] I'm going to be responsible for
[1:13:05] everything that I do that God has called
[1:13:07] me you know then then that that really
[1:13:11] is a sobering thought that I can't be
[1:13:14] laxed in it I I can't just do my own
[1:13:17] thing I I am as what Paul would say a
[1:13:20] prisoner to Jesus Christ you know I I
[1:13:24] would love to to be able to you know uh
[1:13:27] uh take a year and and just go
[1:13:29] sightseeing and and just there's a lot
[1:13:32] of country I'd just love love you know
[1:13:35] I'd love just to be able to float around
[1:13:37] if if you want to say it that way and
[1:13:39] drift over here and have no
[1:13:40] responsibilities and and and just take
[1:13:43] my time and whatever you know just live
[1:13:46] a Carefree life but and and and but I've
[1:13:49] got a responsibility to God yes and and
[1:13:53] and and and so so so then therefore
[1:13:56] doing the will of God is Not Easy A lot
[1:14:00] of times it rubs us the wrong way a lot
[1:14:02] of times it goes against the grain uh of
[1:14:05] our flesh it it it just it just does and
[1:14:08] of course we are people that always
[1:14:10] looks uh uh you know uh as they would
[1:14:14] say the grass is greener on the other
[1:14:16] side right you know everybody's got it
[1:14:18] better than me and and everybody's doing
[1:14:20] it better than me and and and we're
[1:14:23] always looking on the other side of the
[1:14:24] fence at the other guy amen and and and
[1:14:27] so to to stay put or or to do the will
[1:14:31] of God and to do what God has called you
[1:14:33] to do is not an easy thing and and so
[1:14:37] now now God didn't choose people that
[1:14:39] are s super human he didn't choose
[1:14:42] people that were faultless and didn't
[1:14:45] have troubles and he didn't call A A
[1:14:49] Perfect people uh uh descend out into
[1:14:52] the world he he just didn't do that that
[1:14:56] uh I I have said before you know that
[1:14:58] God doesn't choose qualified people but
[1:15:01] he qualifies them whom he chooses and
[1:15:05] and why God would choose us I have no
[1:15:08] idea why God would choose me to preach
[1:15:10] the gospel I have no idea why God would
[1:15:12] put me right where I'm at I have no idea
[1:15:15] I I really don't uh uh but all I know is
[1:15:18] that I'm in God's hands and if I'm in
[1:15:21] God's hands then I've got a
[1:15:23] responsibility I've got a uh a uh uh um
[1:15:27] uh uh a fulfillment to uh uh to achieve
[1:15:31] ain't that right a commission to fulfill
[1:15:34] and and so the the commission itself is
[1:15:37] perfect you believe that the calling of
[1:15:41] god is perfect the choosing of god is
[1:15:46] perfect the voice of god is perfect the
[1:15:50] commission is perfect but the one who he
[1:15:54] sends
[1:15:56] isn't
[1:15:59] amen so when God sent us out when God
[1:16:04] gives us our commission and sends us out
[1:16:07] he doesn't do away with
[1:16:09] Humanity our
[1:16:11] Humanity he doesn't do away with this
[1:16:14] Human Side of us to
[1:16:16] where uh we we're Superman Superwoman
[1:16:20] you know and and and these
[1:16:23] things but
[1:16:25] our Humanity stays with us as long as
[1:16:29] we're in this body of Flesh in this in
[1:16:33] this dimension of
[1:16:34] time mortal and our humanity is what
[1:16:39] brother brandham called a carnal nature
[1:16:42] yes and he says as long as you're in
[1:16:45] this life you're going to be sticky and
[1:16:47] have a carnal nature that's going to
[1:16:49] bother you as long as you live but the
[1:16:52] inside of you you're born again amen
[1:16:55] ain't that right so so you've got a
[1:16:58] perfect commission that has been given
[1:17:01] you you you have been chosen which is a
[1:17:05] perfect choice no one can take your
[1:17:08] place amen ain't that right and yet
[1:17:12] while you're trying to fulfill the
[1:17:14] commission you got a sticky
[1:17:16] nature you got a carnal nature that's
[1:17:19] going to bother
[1:17:22] you well until you're changed have
[1:17:26] received your body changed time of
[1:17:28] rapture ain't that right and and so the
[1:17:31] choosing the commission is perfect that
[1:17:34] comes by
[1:17:36] predestination do you believe
[1:17:38] that and that's what we've got to rest
[1:17:42] in we've got to rest in the
[1:17:44] predestinated will of God for
[1:17:49] us can't rest in your flesh amen can't
[1:17:53] rest in your abilities can't rest in how
[1:17:56] good you think you are you can't rest in
[1:17:58] any of that you have to rest in the
[1:18:01] predestinated plan of God for your life
[1:18:04] sure amen do you believe that so
[1:18:07] fulfilling the commission is not an easy
[1:18:10] thing because of our sticky
[1:18:15] nature we build
[1:18:19] complexes this word
[1:18:23] complex in and Webster's thought of it
[1:18:27] uh one of one of these interpretations
[1:18:30] of it is a system of thoughts feelings
[1:18:34] memories that exist in one's mind but of
[1:18:39] which one is not
[1:18:41] aware and which
[1:18:43] influences one's
[1:18:45] Behavior so this complex a lot of people
[1:18:48] don't even know they've got a
[1:18:50] complex until things come up
[1:18:54] and
[1:18:55] then it it it it shows itself
[1:19:00] complex complexes are caused by things
[1:19:03] that we have experienced in
[1:19:05] life being rejected being laughed at
[1:19:09] made fun of being talked about being
[1:19:14] embarrassed we get complexes by
[1:19:18] comparing ourselves with
[1:19:21] others we can get complexes by being
[1:19:24] hurt by others and it causes us to build
[1:19:28] a complex
[1:19:30] misunderstandings can cause one to build
[1:19:33] a
[1:19:35] complex now now think of it God gives us
[1:19:39] a perfect
[1:19:41] commission and we're all excited about
[1:19:44] it and yet we're a people that can build
[1:19:48] complexes
[1:19:50] hello brother Ram talked about the twin
[1:19:52] girls that were Christians amen both
[1:19:55] were made uh fun of because of the way
[1:19:58] they lived the way they dressed the the
[1:20:00] their beliefs and and all these things
[1:20:02] they were Holiness girls and things and
[1:20:06] but but they were twin girls one of the
[1:20:09] twins uh was able just to override it
[1:20:12] and and ignore the comments and the
[1:20:15] ridicule and and the Jabs and all that
[1:20:18] and uh but but but the other twin sister
[1:20:23] she she she couldn't get past that and
[1:20:26] the prophet said she developed a
[1:20:29] complex now I want you to understand
[1:20:31] this now and she felt real bad about it
[1:20:34] see she felt bad about the way people
[1:20:36] were talking about her and laughing at
[1:20:38] her and and all these things and and it
[1:20:41] just kept you know just kept going away
[1:20:43] she kept going away drifting further
[1:20:47] back and just worrying about it
[1:20:49] constantly worrying about it what people
[1:20:52] say about her what people laugh at and
[1:20:55] and all of these things see she she
[1:20:57] couldn't get over it and finally she got
[1:21:00] a mental
[1:21:02] breakdown now she's in an insane award
[1:21:05] the prophet said her mother and father's
[1:21:07] just coming a little bit you know and
[1:21:10] says oh over there you know to this in
[1:21:12] institution and and they're trying to
[1:21:15] send her to Madison so anyway she and he
[1:21:17] and he says now there's no physical
[1:21:19] break in the girl there's nothing
[1:21:21] physically wrong she's perfectly healthy
[1:21:24] but it's hard to explain it see and it
[1:21:26] really cannot be explained but well he
[1:21:29] says what it is her spirit has
[1:21:32] wandered she had a
[1:21:35] complex and she dwelt on it and dwelt on
[1:21:38] it and dwelt on it and it caused her
[1:21:41] spirit to wander and it drove her
[1:21:45] insane the prophet in another place
[1:21:47] talking about the same girl she built a
[1:21:49] complex got nervous she went insane they
[1:21:53] had her in an in Institution for two
[1:21:55] years see they was trying to doctor her
[1:21:58] by give her all kinds of stuff and
[1:22:00] treatment everything and yet it didn't
[1:22:02] work
[1:22:03] right ain't that right now God by Grace
[1:22:07] helped her amen Lord but but we find it
[1:22:12] I I you you would think that God would
[1:22:14] send people that hadn't no problems like
[1:22:17] that that God would commission people to
[1:22:21] fulfill his purpose and had no worries
[1:22:24] true true but that's not true amen am we
[1:22:28] all
[1:22:32] worry we all get
[1:22:35] hurt we all feel
[1:22:38] pain we all experience things in our
[1:22:42] lives that shake us to the
[1:22:48] core brother random said it's so easy to
[1:22:51] build a
[1:22:53] complex it's so easy he said I guess if
[1:22:57] I'd asked tonight in this audience of
[1:22:59] people how many in here knows you have a
[1:23:01] complex he said practically every hand
[1:23:03] would go up a people that God sends to
[1:23:07] fulfill his will his commission and we
[1:23:10] all have
[1:23:11] complexes Satan
[1:23:13] Works Satan works on that human
[1:23:16] nature amen can you say man in the
[1:23:20] message standing in the Gap brother
[1:23:22] brandham even talked of the complexes
[1:23:24] that he himself built up a prophet of
[1:23:29] God that could take himself in the
[1:23:33] scriptures show us what his ministry is
[1:23:36] in the scriptures and yet he had complex
[1:23:40] yeah he said and here's here's what it
[1:23:43] was he said I built myself a complex
[1:23:46] because the people didn't hear my
[1:23:49] message I built myself a complex because
[1:23:52] the people didn't set my message now
[1:23:56] Moses built himself a complex too
[1:23:59] remember God sends Moses out of all
[1:24:02] people God sends Moses Moses we find out
[1:24:06] was not pctop perfect he was not he was
[1:24:08] not perfect in his human well had a
[1:24:10] temper for one but he had a
[1:24:15] complex
[1:24:16] right and and and so uh uh the prophet
[1:24:20] said see the people wouldn't listen to
[1:24:22] him when he come to deliver them so he
[1:24:24] just left them alone went into the
[1:24:26] Wilderness but God turned him around
[1:24:29] notice what this complex done he had for
[1:24:32] long forgot the suffering people yes he
[1:24:36] he actually walked away by this
[1:24:40] complex he walks away from his calling
[1:24:43] walks away from it
[1:24:46] all because the people wasn't ready to
[1:24:48] hear his message and you say amen amen
[1:24:52] but also on top of that Moses had a
[1:24:55] stuttering
[1:24:58] problem that he was embarrassed
[1:25:01] about you going to send me I get before
[1:25:04] that King make a fool of
[1:25:07] myself
[1:25:08] right and so there was complexes in his
[1:25:11] life that he had to overcome that's
[1:25:16] right brother brandham talks about his
[1:25:19] complex that he built up in himself it
[1:25:22] it actually
[1:25:24] made him he
[1:25:26] determined to go hide out in the
[1:25:29] wilderness shut himself away from the
[1:25:33] people right and only come out when the
[1:25:36] Lord told him to say something he' just
[1:25:39] he'd just drop in say it like like the
[1:25:42] prophets of the Old Testament and then
[1:25:44] just go back into the Wilderness because
[1:25:46] he had built up this
[1:25:48] complex so by that
[1:25:52] complex he he he was going to do
[1:25:54] something you know outside the will of
[1:25:58] God but God showed him what would happen
[1:26:01] to him if he did as he planned can you
[1:26:03] say Amen you see God doesn't forget the
[1:26:08] commission God doesn't forget what he's
[1:26:11] called you to
[1:26:12] do can you say amen amen we can forget
[1:26:16] many times because of our human nature
[1:26:21] we can forget and this is the trouble
[1:26:24] we've got to keep guard of everything
[1:26:28] around us because Satan's going to take
[1:26:30] that sticky nature and try to sway us
[1:26:33] this way sway us that way sway us all
[1:26:35] kinds of ways but we are obligated to
[1:26:38] God to stay in his
[1:26:41] will and you say Amen so God doesn't
[1:26:45] forget his commission and I say to you
[1:26:47] God doesn't forget you
[1:26:50] either of all the prophets of all the
[1:26:53] men of of
[1:26:56] old that had their complexes and wanted
[1:27:00] to quit wanted to give up wanted to do
[1:27:03] something else God never forgot them
[1:27:05] right God sent Jonah to go to Nineveh
[1:27:09] Jonah Jonah didn't want to go to Nineveh
[1:27:12] right but God didn't raise somebody else
[1:27:15] up God remembered his commission and God
[1:27:19] remembered his
[1:27:22] servant ain't that right
[1:27:25] see no one can take your place
[1:27:28] amen complexes opens the door to
[1:27:31] bitterness
[1:27:33] right and what that does it causes us to
[1:27:36] lose sight of our
[1:27:39] commission bitterness is something that
[1:27:42] and complexes it all goes together I
[1:27:46] believe but it makes people want to
[1:27:48] close theirself in so that they don't
[1:27:51] get hurt anymore that they don't be
[1:27:53] bothered anymore more that they don't
[1:27:55] have to uh deal with things anymore and
[1:28:00] if God has called you to do something
[1:28:01] you're going to have to deal with
[1:28:05] it
[1:28:07] hello Satan's there to back you know to
[1:28:10] combat you all the step every step of
[1:28:12] the
[1:28:14] way can you say Amen but it makes people
[1:28:18] hardened to the gospel brother brah said
[1:28:21] if you want to get anywhere with God
[1:28:23] never let an arrogance Spirit come
[1:28:24] around you don't let No Malice come in
[1:28:27] no matter what anybody does if they are
[1:28:29] wrong don't you never build up a complx
[1:28:32] against that person You' be sweet and
[1:28:34] kind and remember God loved you when you
[1:28:36] were in sin and if the spirit of God is
[1:28:38] in you then you love the other person
[1:28:40] when he's in the wrong and just pray for
[1:28:42] them and love one another can you say
[1:28:45] Amen now that's easier said than done I
[1:28:48] promise you
[1:28:49] that but nonetheless we've got a
[1:28:52] commission right yeah true ain't that
[1:28:56] right it's easy to to baby this old
[1:28:59] flesh it's easy to pet this thing it's
[1:29:02] easy to to to to to base the will of God
[1:29:06] upon us as to what we want to
[1:29:12] be ain't that
[1:29:15] right now God is depending on us can you
[1:29:19] say that with me God is depending on us
[1:29:23] God is depending on us he's not going to
[1:29:25] replace you he's depending upon
[1:29:29] you you can't
[1:29:31] hide you can't
[1:29:34] run you you you you you you got to stay
[1:29:38] in the perfect will of
[1:29:41] God and and I think of of uh brother
[1:29:44] Bram talked about U running that you
[1:29:47] preach that message running from the
[1:29:49] presence of the Lord and he talking
[1:29:51] about that our our responsibility to God
[1:29:54] God and to the will of God yes can you
[1:29:57] say Amen it may hurt it may cut it may
[1:30:00] it may go against our grain it might it
[1:30:02] may whatever but we're here to do the
[1:30:05] will of
[1:30:09] God you love the
[1:30:11] Lord if you look at even even
[1:30:16] Paul and Paul being the first church age
[1:30:20] messenger and he had a great
[1:30:22] experience what a tremendous uh
[1:30:25] experience introduction to Jesus Christ
[1:30:28] they saw him in the pillar of
[1:30:30] fire
[1:30:33] personally and and he saw him in a
[1:30:36] greater way than even the apostles or
[1:30:39] disciples saw him when he was in the
[1:30:41] flesh and and and these things and you
[1:30:44] know his story and how God changed him
[1:30:46] turned him
[1:30:48] around and interesting that in in in in
[1:30:54] his time of of conversion and being a
[1:30:57] new convert God told him that he must
[1:30:59] suffer many things that's
[1:31:03] right so God just let him know right off
[1:31:06] the bat so here he's the first church
[1:31:08] age messenger but then we find out that
[1:31:11] he struggled many things but he had an
[1:31:12] obstacle in his
[1:31:14] life and and in second Corinthians 12
[1:31:19] and8 Paul actually tells us that he
[1:31:22] sought the Lord three three times to
[1:31:24] take this obstacle away from him Paul
[1:31:28] wanted to fulfill the commission but uh
[1:31:32] this obstacle he felt was was hindering
[1:31:35] him from fulfilling the
[1:31:38] commission and and so but this was what
[1:31:41] God said to him he said my grace is
[1:31:44] sufficient for
[1:31:46] thee right my grace is sufficient for
[1:31:50] thee for my strength is made perfect in
[1:31:54] weakness can you say Amen my strength
[1:31:58] God God didn't agree with Paul see it's
[1:32:01] amazing how that a lot of times we think
[1:32:03] God will agree with us and God doesn't
[1:32:06] we think here what Paul was saying that
[1:32:08] you know basically this is this is
[1:32:10] really a pain th this is hindering me
[1:32:13] and and and if you just I just wish
[1:32:15] you'd take it away and yet Paul or God
[1:32:18] would tell him no I'm not not going to
[1:32:19] take it away my strength is made perfect
[1:32:23] in weakness
[1:32:26] can you say
[1:32:27] amen and and the weakness that Paul had
[1:32:30] brother Bram said was
[1:32:32] blindness Paul had been in prison for
[1:32:35] most of his
[1:32:37] ministry and he went blind he had to
[1:32:41] have someone else to write his letters
[1:32:42] or if he did write it he actually he
[1:32:44] would say it that I'm writing in large
[1:32:46] large print and all these
[1:32:49] things and so what Paul would consider a
[1:32:52] hindrance
[1:32:54] God considered a a way to his strength
[1:32:59] to be perfected can you say Amen so God
[1:33:02] doesn't take away things that maybe we
[1:33:05] would think he would take away things
[1:33:08] that we consider to be a hindrance to us
[1:33:11] from fulfilling the commission no God
[1:33:14] knows what he's
[1:33:17] doing amen
[1:33:22] true amen
[1:33:25] so we find that we cannot measure our
[1:33:28] ability to fulfill the commission by our
[1:33:32] weakness then then we see then it's all
[1:33:35] about
[1:33:37] surrendering it's surrendering to
[1:33:41] God because to to do his will you have
[1:33:45] to be totally
[1:33:46] surrendered
[1:33:48] hello you have to be totally surrendered
[1:33:53] and and because God has given us a
[1:33:56] commission we we all have this desire to
[1:33:58] fulfill it as I've said we we we want to
[1:34:02] to to do something for the Lord and
[1:34:05] these things but often times again we go
[1:34:08] back to the complexes that a person can
[1:34:10] build a complex by looking at what
[1:34:11] others are doing for God and he or she
[1:34:15] can minimize what God has called them to
[1:34:18] do by looking at what others are doing
[1:34:22] yes and ain't that right and and again
[1:34:25] this comes from this carnal nature that
[1:34:27] we have to deal with on a daily
[1:34:30] basis brother Bram talks about it just
[1:34:33] in his own personal life he said you
[1:34:37] know he said I was thinking yesterday in
[1:34:38] my talk to a neighbor boy and he said
[1:34:40] you know a certain little Pastor he said
[1:34:42] he's just such a wonderful fella said
[1:34:44] wife and I were sitting with our pajamas
[1:34:46] on and said about 11: at night he come
[1:34:48] by and knocked at the door and you know
[1:34:52] uh uh said come by to have have a cup of
[1:34:55] coffee with you you know and said he cut
[1:34:58] across the street to another neighbor
[1:35:00] and they were just about ready to go to
[1:35:01] bed and he eat a cookie over there with
[1:35:03] him and then he said you know he had a
[1:35:05] little bible school for the for the
[1:35:07] kitties and and he had so much so many
[1:35:10] little kitties there him and his wife
[1:35:12] until they had to put up tents on the
[1:35:14] outside to accommodate the children and
[1:35:16] I went back now now this affected
[1:35:18] brother brandham hearing hearing this
[1:35:21] man talk about this little other pastor
[1:35:23] it affected brother Bram and he and he
[1:35:26] says I I went back and I got to thinking
[1:35:29] you know that's right that's a wonderful
[1:35:31] little fella and I believe you know he
[1:35:33] said brother fleeman here I believe this
[1:35:35] boy goes there it's a Little Faith
[1:35:37] Lutheran Church up here just a wonderful
[1:35:39] little man and his wife they're doing a
[1:35:41] great work for the Lord and I thought I
[1:35:44] I got to Wasing my car and I become
[1:35:48] discouraged think of that I I I I become
[1:35:52] discouraged and I thought well why is it
[1:35:54] that I can't do that go around get all
[1:35:57] the kids the to follow me around he said
[1:36:00] I love kitties and and why can't I jump
[1:36:03] from house to house and from Pillar To
[1:36:05] Post like that and something just said
[1:36:07] to me you wasn't called for
[1:36:11] that you wasn't called for that that's
[1:36:14] can you say Amen what God called them
[1:36:17] that man to do that's fine but God
[1:36:20] didn't call Brother random to do that
[1:36:23] God called us to preach this message
[1:36:26] what other people are doing that's fine
[1:36:28] that God's called them to do that but
[1:36:30] we're called to preach
[1:36:32] this can you say Amen see and and and
[1:36:36] it's so easy to build
[1:36:39] complexes because every time we witness
[1:36:41] to people oh you're an ultt oh you're
[1:36:43] this and oh you're that well I wouldn't
[1:36:45] do that you know well then the next guy
[1:36:47] he's over there witnessing and
[1:36:48] everybody's running there you know and
[1:36:50] doing this and doing that he's got the
[1:36:51] programs he's got all that and buil
[1:36:54] complexes as though the message ain't
[1:36:56] got power enough and the people are just
[1:36:59] narrow-minded or or you know uh uh
[1:37:02] people in the message think they're
[1:37:03] better than everybody else that's
[1:37:07] nonsense but it comes from
[1:37:11] complexes people walk away from this
[1:37:13] message because they feel like it's lost
[1:37:15] its lost its Glory it hasn't lost its
[1:37:18] Glory it's sent for the
[1:37:21] bride that's right that's the truth you
[1:37:24] remember Deus built complexes toward
[1:37:27] Paul thought he was washed
[1:37:30] up thought he he just His Glory Days was
[1:37:33] over with and he walked away from
[1:37:37] Paul yet brother Ram said it was the
[1:37:39] crowning of his
[1:37:41] ministry where Paul was that was God
[1:37:43] crowning his
[1:37:45] ministry but see God's will is so
[1:37:48] different from our
[1:37:50] will that's it right there
[1:37:56] so if you're called to preach if you're
[1:38:00] called to sing if you're called to be a
[1:38:02] housewife if you're called to be a
[1:38:04] musician if you're called whatever God
[1:38:06] has called you in stay in that
[1:38:10] calling and we must not as though it is
[1:38:14] so easy to do is compare our own selves
[1:38:20] with everybody
[1:38:21] else not every housewife is going to
[1:38:23] have her house run the same way as the
[1:38:25] other
[1:38:28] person sure if you're not careful you'll
[1:38:31] beat yourself down and say well I'm just
[1:38:33] not a good housewife I'm just not good
[1:38:35] I'm not good at raising my children I'm
[1:38:36] not good at you know being this and I'm
[1:38:38] not good at
[1:38:39] that and you start building these
[1:38:43] complexes and you forget about what
[1:38:45] God's called you to do that's right if
[1:38:48] God wanted you to be sister so and so he
[1:38:51] would have made you that way
[1:38:54] amen but God has confidence in you amen
[1:38:58] he knows all about you he knows all
[1:39:00] about your makeup and your
[1:39:03] personality he knows all about your
[1:39:05] strengths and your
[1:39:09] weaknesses right that goes for for
[1:39:13] Ministry that goes for
[1:39:16] churches that goes for
[1:39:18] anyone
[1:39:20] musicians don't ever compare yourself
[1:39:22] with the next Church down the road right
[1:39:25] that's the problem with Internet
[1:39:26] everybody gets on the internet and look
[1:39:28] watch these other churches oh man
[1:39:30] they're doing this and they're doing
[1:39:31] this why can't we that's right you
[1:39:34] understand what I'm saying and it builds
[1:39:36] discontentment
[1:39:38] right I think every man should be the
[1:39:41] best preacher he ought to he can be amen
[1:39:44] but to be the best doesn't mean that you
[1:39:45] have to be like somebody
[1:39:48] else every musician ought to be the best
[1:39:51] if you're going to play in the church be
[1:39:52] your best
[1:39:55] but your best shouldn't be the standard
[1:39:57] of some other
[1:40:00] Church Lord every Minister ought to do
[1:40:03] their best every minister in this
[1:40:05] message ought to study this
[1:40:07] messagen give their all to it but not
[1:40:11] everybody is going to preach like
[1:40:12] brother Wayne Lawson or Andrew Glover or
[1:40:16] or
[1:40:19] whoever but you're best in what God has
[1:40:22] called you to be that's
[1:40:25] right
[1:40:28] amen if we're not careful we build these
[1:40:30] complexes and we forget about the goal
[1:40:32] we forget about the
[1:40:34] commission hello but God before when he
[1:40:38] called you and he chose you that was
[1:40:41] perfect in his calling do you believe
[1:40:43] that God is perfect in his calling you
[1:40:46] can't complain to God about his calling
[1:40:49] amen so often we can do yes
[1:40:56] I hope you
[1:40:58] understand I'm preaching to myself this
[1:41:00] morning so if it's not for you it's for
[1:41:04] me in another place brother
[1:41:10] brandom you know he says many times
[1:41:12] people go out and see an evangelist like
[1:41:15] for instance our brother Billy Graham
[1:41:17] now what good would it do for me to try
[1:41:19] to be like Billy Graham I couldn't do it
[1:41:22] if I had to
[1:41:24] now think of that see he said I've got a
[1:41:28] Min Ministry that I've got to take care
[1:41:30] of can you say that with me I've got a
[1:41:33] Ministry that I've got to take care of
[1:41:36] I've got a Ministry that I've got to
[1:41:39] take care
[1:41:40] of I I I ain't going to take care of
[1:41:42] brother amos's Ministry I can't he can't
[1:41:46] take care of my Ministry amen he's got a
[1:41:48] Ministry that he's got to take care of
[1:41:50] I've got a Ministry that I've got to
[1:41:52] take care of because we're all
[1:41:54] responsible to
[1:41:55] God ain't that right that's right every
[1:41:59] singer is going to be responsible to God
[1:42:02] every musician is going to be
[1:42:03] responsible to God how you played how
[1:42:05] your attitude how how you approached it
[1:42:08] you know you know everybody has got a
[1:42:12] Ministry that they're going to be
[1:42:14] responsible to God so they've got to
[1:42:16] take care of
[1:42:17] it ain't that right and yet and that's
[1:42:20] all in our human human I mean you're
[1:42:23] you're going to face hurts you're going
[1:42:24] to face rejection you're going to face
[1:42:26] ups and
[1:42:33] downs so he said I've got a Ministry
[1:42:35] that I've got to take care of and the
[1:42:37] next man's got his ministry and each one
[1:42:40] has got a Ministry even to the housewife
[1:42:43] has a Ministry of ministering the word
[1:42:45] of
[1:42:46] God ain't that right see so now if I try
[1:42:50] to impersonate Mr Graham I'd find s in
[1:42:53] trouble right quick cuz he's smart
[1:42:55] shrewd educated a real preacher well I'm
[1:42:57] not well see maybe if Mr Graham tried to
[1:43:00] find himself imp impersonating me he'd
[1:43:02] be in trouble too so there you are so we
[1:43:05] can't do that we've got to do what God
[1:43:07] has revealed to us to do see brother
[1:43:11] Graham is doing that God has revealed to
[1:43:13] him a worldwide Revival and he's making
[1:43:15] a good show of it too and I appreciate
[1:43:18] him and I'm trying my best by the
[1:43:20] Revelation that God has given me to
[1:43:22] minister to the sick people and to do
[1:43:24] what he told me to do can you say Amen
[1:43:27] now I pray that God helps us helps us
[1:43:29] all to understand and and uh uh and you
[1:43:34] know that that every every member in the
[1:43:37] body is important and if we're members
[1:43:40] of the body then we're important can you
[1:43:43] sayen the Bible says that God gave gifts
[1:43:46] unto men and and so not everybody's
[1:43:49] going to have the same gift one one
[1:43:51] individual is going to his gift is going
[1:43:54] to differ from another man's gift we all
[1:43:57] don't have the same gifts talents we all
[1:43:59] don't sing alike We Don't Preach alike
[1:44:01] and we all don't experience things alike
[1:44:06] true true ain't that right so then a a
[1:44:10] man cannot judge his current experience
[1:44:14] that he is going through with another
[1:44:15] man's
[1:44:17] experience you know you you you you you
[1:44:20] might be going through the valley you
[1:44:21] might be going as job does
[1:44:23] where you're sitting there thinking
[1:44:25] where is God the next man he might be on
[1:44:28] the Mountaintop I mean he's in the
[1:44:30] presence of God all the
[1:44:32] time and it would be so easy for the
[1:44:36] devil to convince us that God has
[1:44:38] forsaken us that God is not with us
[1:44:43] because we compare
[1:44:45] ourselves but if God has sent us and
[1:44:49] commissioned us then God will never
[1:44:51] leave us never for forsake us but he
[1:44:54] said he'd be with us all the
[1:44:56] way whether you feel him or not whether
[1:44:58] you see him or
[1:45:01] not therefore you have to remain
[1:45:03] faithful in what God has called you to
[1:45:04] do amen can you say amen that's right so
[1:45:08] so we all have our different paths to
[1:45:11] walk we all go through different seasons
[1:45:12] in our life in our ministry in our
[1:45:15] Christian walk we all go through
[1:45:18] different seasons some may be going
[1:45:20] through trials here in this building
[1:45:22] this morning others may be on the
[1:45:24] mountain top this morning but we all go
[1:45:27] through
[1:45:28] it one on the mountain top can't look
[1:45:30] down and say man you know you're a real
[1:45:33] basket case you know no and and the guy
[1:45:38] in in down in the valley can't look up
[1:45:39] the guy at the mountain say wow look at
[1:45:44] you you know you you just can't do
[1:45:49] that ain't that right now Ecclesiastes 3
[1:45:53] and one to everything there is a season
[1:45:55] and a time to every purpose under the
[1:45:57] heaven a time to be born a time to die a
[1:45:59] time to plant a time to pluck up that
[1:46:01] which is planted and this is all in the
[1:46:04] will of
[1:46:05] God A Time to Kill a time to heal a time
[1:46:08] to break down a time to build up a time
[1:46:10] to weep A Time To Laugh A Time to mourn
[1:46:12] a time to dance a time to Cast Away
[1:46:14] Stones a time to gather uh uh Stones
[1:46:17] together a time to embrace a time to
[1:46:20] refrain from embracing a time to get a
[1:46:22] time to lose lose a time to keep a time
[1:46:24] to Cast Away a time to render or to Rend
[1:46:27] a time to Soul a time to keep silence a
[1:46:30] time to speak a time to love a time to
[1:46:32] hate a time of War a time of Peace a
[1:46:35] time a time a time a time God sets times
[1:46:38] for it all
[1:46:40] seasons and a lot of time we just don't
[1:46:42] understand that in the seasons as to
[1:46:45] why but we know at the end of these
[1:46:49] these verses it says but he makes all
[1:46:52] things beautiful
[1:46:53] in his time true can you say Amen so God
[1:46:58] deals with us on a personal level it's
[1:47:00] not a group thing and we must understand
[1:47:03] that it's not a group
[1:47:05] thing so if it's it's it's an individual
[1:47:09] thing yes in a local body we are to come
[1:47:11] together we are to be in unity we are to
[1:47:14] work together for one goal for one
[1:47:16] achievement but when when it comes to
[1:47:19] the will of God for our personal life
[1:47:21] it's an individual thing and like I say
[1:47:24] but God always brings the edification to
[1:47:26] the whole body with it it's if you
[1:47:30] understand what I'm saying so but but
[1:47:32] but it's it's it's it's it's an
[1:47:34] individual thing and so so you know
[1:47:37] we're having our own experiences with
[1:47:40] God and you know brother brandham uh
[1:47:42] sung this song A lot uh there in Shady
[1:47:46] Green Pastor so rich and so sweet God
[1:47:49] leads his dear children alone where
[1:47:51] Waters cool flow bathes the weary one's
[1:47:55] feet God leads his dear children along
[1:47:58] some through the water some through the
[1:48:00] flood some through the fire but all
[1:48:03] through the blood some through great
[1:48:06] sorrow but God gives the song in the
[1:48:09] night season and all the day long some
[1:48:11] on the mount where the sun shines so
[1:48:13] bright God leads his dear children
[1:48:17] alone sometimes in the valley in the
[1:48:19] darkest of night yet God leads his dear
[1:48:23] children along through those sorrows
[1:48:26] befall us and Satan oppose God leads his
[1:48:30] dear children alone and through Grace we
[1:48:33] can conquer and defeat all our foes God
[1:48:38] leads his dear children alone that's
[1:48:42] true I'm so glad that he leads
[1:48:45] us I'm so glad that when he gave us the
[1:48:48] commission we don't have to compare
[1:48:50] ourselves to others right
[1:48:54] that we can do his will regardless of
[1:48:57] what others
[1:48:58] think what others say what others feel
[1:49:02] amen we have to do his will we have to
[1:49:05] do as he tells us
[1:49:08] amen can you say amen amen we all have
[1:49:12] our cross to
[1:49:14] bear but we must be satisfied in our
[1:49:18] calling and we must rest in it ain't
[1:49:21] that righten
[1:49:24] and we must drive to do our best within
[1:49:28] the bounds of our
[1:49:31] calling amen for God made us the way we
[1:49:34] are ain't that right now if we could
[1:49:37] realize that to be true there wouldn't
[1:49:38] be so much
[1:49:41] discontentment that so often hits
[1:49:45] us as I get ready to close I I think I
[1:49:49] think it comes by God revealing it to us
[1:49:54] we have to find that direct Revelation
[1:49:58] the prophet said of our life to fit in
[1:50:00] the program of Goden Moses had to have a
[1:50:04] direct contact with God to know how and
[1:50:07] when to do it and he said and that's
[1:50:09] where the Pentecostals have failed can
[1:50:11] you say
[1:50:12] Amen you see when we thinking of
[1:50:15] surrender we are all different members
[1:50:17] with different gifts but we belong to
[1:50:19] one body that is controlled by one
[1:50:23] spirit and in Colossians 1:18 Paul
[1:50:26] speaks of Christ saying he is the head
[1:50:28] of the body aren't you glad for that he
[1:50:31] is the head of the body the church who
[1:50:34] is the beginning the firstborn from the
[1:50:36] dead that in all things he might have
[1:50:39] preeminence now you think this is the
[1:50:41] place that we have come to in this day
[1:50:44] and age is that God is having complete
[1:50:48] preeminence in the body if we're that
[1:50:52] body then God is having compl complete
[1:50:55] preeminence in your personal walk in
[1:50:57] your personal commission it's God
[1:51:00] leading and we becoming fully
[1:51:02] surrendered to what God wants does it
[1:51:05] rub us wrong yes do do we always see it
[1:51:08] at you know see what God is doing no but
[1:51:11] there's something down inside of us that
[1:51:13] know that God's leading us to do this
[1:51:16] and God's leading us to do that and it
[1:51:19] paints and it works out for the best for
[1:51:22] for for the the you see the whole
[1:51:24] picture of it eventually can you say
[1:51:27] amen and and so the gifts that God has
[1:51:30] given us are to be under his control and
[1:51:33] this is how he uses us he he doesn't
[1:51:36] give it your ability he gives you a gift
[1:51:40] he gives you a gift so that he can work
[1:51:42] through You by that gift see but before
[1:51:45] he can send us then he has to have us
[1:51:48] under his control to where we're not
[1:51:50] trying to work the gift but he is
[1:51:52] actually working the gift this where so
[1:51:55] many people get in in trouble by
[1:51:57] prophecies and dreams and visions and
[1:51:59] all that and and because they say it's
[1:52:02] of God but God is not the one that is
[1:52:05] speaking but when God uses that gift and
[1:52:08] he speaks then watch it happen watch it
[1:52:12] come to pass it happens just exactly
[1:52:16] true God uses the gift amen so therefore
[1:52:20] he has to have us under control Ro to
[1:52:23] where it's not a competitive God
[1:52:25] competing against us God we using the
[1:52:28] gift when God's wanting to use the gift
[1:52:29] and we're making a a show of it and and
[1:52:32] making a failure of it anytime that a
[1:52:34] man uses his gift on his own ability he
[1:52:36] makes a failure
[1:52:39] amen now brother Bram said there's many
[1:52:41] people that will welcome Jesus in as
[1:52:44] Savior but he can but can he be your
[1:52:46] lord lord is ownership see the Lord has
[1:52:49] complete control you would plenti
[1:52:52] welcome him to keep you out of hell and
[1:52:54] torment you would welcome him as your
[1:52:57] savior but are you willing to welcome
[1:52:59] him as your lord to take over full
[1:53:02] control can you say Amen is this okay
[1:53:06] amen being that we are free moral agents
[1:53:10] then then it's up to us we're not robots
[1:53:13] we're not one that's God just computes
[1:53:15] it and then we just automatically do
[1:53:18] it again this is where the struggle
[1:53:21] comes because we have the stick nature
[1:53:23] but we are free moral
[1:53:25] agents therefore we have to make our
[1:53:28] choice Paul says I Die daily so it's
[1:53:31] something that is a daily Choice it's
[1:53:33] something that when we wake up Lord I'm
[1:53:36] here to do your
[1:53:38] will I'm I'm here to surrender myself to
[1:53:40] you yes I'm here not to walk on my own
[1:53:43] ways not to offer you my own ideas just
[1:53:46] God whatever you want for me that's what
[1:53:49] I want can you amen and and and so we
[1:53:53] must surrender ourselves to him so that
[1:53:55] he can use us in whatever capacity he so
[1:53:58] chooses we shouldn't go unless he says
[1:54:01] to
[1:54:02] go we shouldn't say stay unless he says
[1:54:06] to stay we shouldn't do something unless
[1:54:09] he tells us to do it and we shouldn't
[1:54:11] hold back unless he tells us to do it
[1:54:15] you see brother Ram says it's God's
[1:54:16] election and forn knowledge is what
[1:54:18] makes the thing so if we have a desire
[1:54:21] the Bible says it's not him that willth
[1:54:24] or him that runneth but it's God that
[1:54:26] showeth Mercy it's not whether you will
[1:54:29] or whether you want to or where your
[1:54:31] desires is it's whether it is God's will
[1:54:33] or not then we have to find out God's
[1:54:35] will and if it's that if it's that
[1:54:38] perfect we can just set our faith to
[1:54:41] that and say this is it and we run right
[1:54:44] on the way the will of God runs can you
[1:54:48] say Amen you see Jesus knew what the
[1:54:51] will of the father was
[1:54:53] brother brandham said we are so blessed
[1:54:55] because we have the privilege to know
[1:54:56] the father's will ain't that right and
[1:54:59] if we will seek God if we will seek God
[1:55:04] then he will make his will known to us
[1:55:08] ain't that right you love him
[1:55:11] Amen brother brandham says here you know
[1:55:16] uh he said I'd rather know that I was in
[1:55:20] the will of God if I never spoke spoke
[1:55:22] to another
[1:55:24] person than to preach to 10,000 people
[1:55:27] every night out of the will of God I'd
[1:55:30] rather know the will of God he said I
[1:55:33] believe it was David that said I'd
[1:55:34] rather be a doormat or something at the
[1:55:37] house of my Lord than to dwell in tents
[1:55:39] with the wicked see what a privilege
[1:55:43] everybody say what a privilege what a
[1:55:46] privilege to find our place and there
[1:55:49] abide no matter how the devil shakes
[1:55:52] what he says and how or how he scoffs
[1:55:56] stay right straight in the will of God
[1:56:00] and I think any child of God will
[1:56:03] respect leadership of
[1:56:05] God of others
[1:56:08] amen because he himself is under the
[1:56:12] leadership of God can you say Amen Lord
[1:56:16] and so this is why every man must be led
[1:56:19] by the spirit of God and he must follow
[1:56:21] the leader ship of the spirit whether
[1:56:23] people understand it or
[1:56:25] not you know and I as as I
[1:56:31] close I think it's important that we
[1:56:33] understand
[1:56:36] this leadership of the Holy Ghost is so
[1:56:42] important
[1:56:44] because as we grow in the Lord we we
[1:56:48] come more into the fullness of what God
[1:56:51] desires for us you believe that as we
[1:56:56] grow we come more into the
[1:56:59] fullness of what God desires God doesn't
[1:57:02] show us everything all at once
[1:57:08] true with the will of God comes
[1:57:13] changes
[1:57:16] Junctions
[1:57:20] Crossroads Cutting Loose
[1:57:26] yes and a lot of times it leaves us in
[1:57:30] tears it leaves us wandering true it
[1:57:34] leaves us
[1:57:37] broken but yet it's the will of God
[1:57:41] Amen it's just like as a child we've all
[1:57:45] developed when when we started out as a
[1:57:49] little infant child but that wasn't God
[1:57:52] 's plan for us to stay
[1:57:55] there then we start growing and with
[1:57:58] that comes
[1:57:59] changes
[1:58:01] right there's sometimes you might Mama
[1:58:05] might say man I wish I wish I wish my
[1:58:07] children wouldn't have growed up so fast
[1:58:10] I'd just love to cuddle them well you
[1:58:13] can't cuddle your 30-y
[1:58:15] old there's
[1:58:17] changes but then you develop you develop
[1:58:21] and and you then you come come into a
[1:58:22] toddler age and then we continue to grow
[1:58:26] until we come into adolescent years and
[1:58:29] that that's where you know the child
[1:58:31] starts developing into
[1:58:34] adulthood right and and they you know
[1:58:37] they say early ad adolescent years begin
[1:58:39] you know from age 10 to
[1:58:42] 13 and the voice begins to change and
[1:58:46] the child begins to change his ways of
[1:58:49] his thoughts and used to you know you
[1:58:52] used to goooo and gag G and used to this
[1:58:54] and then he develops into to walking and
[1:58:58] and and and he stumbles and he so easy
[1:59:00] to trip you know so easy to fall gets
[1:59:02] note head you know my grandpa always
[1:59:04] called me note head I begin to
[1:59:06] understand why maybe I fail so much you
[1:59:09] know and and but but you know then then
[1:59:12] you start you start developing and you
[1:59:15] watch your child and look where we're at
[1:59:17] today and yet we still haven't come to
[1:59:21] our full potential
[1:59:23] ual because in each stage of development
[1:59:26] we're doing something we're experiencing
[1:59:28] something we're achieving
[1:59:31] something
[1:59:34] right so through all of our lifetime as
[1:59:38] we develop we experience changes we
[1:59:41] experience challenges we turn Corners in
[1:59:44] our life we come to
[1:59:47] Crossroads we experience Growing Pains
[1:59:52] a lot of things become memories
[1:59:54] hopefully they're good memories but all
[1:59:57] of us have our memories that we don't
[1:59:59] like to think
[2:00:00] about
[2:00:02] right but this is what happens in our
[2:00:04] spiritual life we we have growing pains
[2:00:07] and brother brand says he may permit
[2:00:09] Crossroads he may permit Crossroads to
[2:00:12] try us to perfect us for his service he
[2:00:14] may permit that now church both here and
[2:00:17] on tape he may permit the crossroads for
[2:00:19] our service like he did Daniel he gave
[2:00:22] Daniel a little Crossroad one day you
[2:00:24] know when he was a great man down in
[2:00:26] Babylon he did he let the king turn
[2:00:28] against him and throw him and the Lions
[2:00:30] then it only perfected him sure did let
[2:00:33] the Hebrew children go into the fiery
[2:00:35] furnace they was determined to stand for
[2:00:37] his word he may permit Crossroads let
[2:00:40] them laugh at you for having long hair
[2:00:42] let them laugh at you for saying why you
[2:00:44] become a holy ruler whatever more see
[2:00:47] they may laugh at you for that and this
[2:00:51] and that and well that that's all right
[2:00:53] see that's a crossroad that's a little
[2:00:55] Junction that's to prove something see
[2:00:58] but you can't forget the commission now
[2:01:01] right see the only thing that the
[2:01:03] crossroad did to the Hebrew children
[2:01:06] that stood on the word it only loosed
[2:01:08] them from the bands that they had around
[2:01:10] their feet and the legs and sometimes it
[2:01:12] takes hard trials to break the bands of
[2:01:14] the world off of us sometimes God lets
[2:01:17] us have a little trial you know to see
[2:01:19] what we'll do to take the world out out
[2:01:22] of you or take you out of the world or
[2:01:24] other words let you have a little trial
[2:01:26] and knock you out of that organization
[2:01:28] and that idea that the Methodist is the
[2:01:30] only one or the Baptist or the Pentecost
[2:01:32] or that's you know that that's the only
[2:01:34] group they got and you know if you don't
[2:01:37] believe it like my church believes it
[2:01:39] then you don't believe at all and
[2:01:40] sometimes he lets little Trials happen
[2:01:42] and maybe you got a sick baby maybe
[2:01:45] something takes place right at the hour
[2:01:46] of death maybe someone taken from you
[2:01:49] see or or something what's to do to
[2:01:52] break you away to show you something to
[2:01:54] open your eyes maybe you have to you
[2:01:57] you've come to criticize you know and
[2:01:59] maybe you're listening to this tape just
[2:02:01] to criticize maybe God's doing that to
[2:02:03] break some of the worldly bands that has
[2:02:05] got around got you bound down see and so
[2:02:09] he permits Junctions and Crossroads to
[2:02:12] do those things stand on the Promises
[2:02:15] the word for they never fail the future
[2:02:18] that's in his hands stand like they did
[2:02:21] and don't give away can you say
[2:02:23] amen and in this time in our Christian
[2:02:26] walk we experience a development of
[2:02:29] character our ministry develops our
[2:02:32] Christian walk
[2:02:34] develops and I truly believe that
[2:02:36] development comes by the experiences we
[2:02:40] have don't get bitter don't build
[2:02:43] complexes can you say
[2:02:46] Amen Let It Be that we become more
[2:02:49] surrendered to God we become more broken
[2:02:52] to where God can use us more that we can
[2:02:55] become more sensitive to his leadership
[2:02:58] that we come to realize more and more
[2:03:00] that we're nothing without him can you
[2:03:03] say
[2:03:04] Amen it's it's then we become more
[2:03:07] compatible for the ministry that God has
[2:03:09] called us to we become more
[2:03:12] compassionate toward others I thought of
[2:03:15] Sharon Rose when brother brand talks
[2:03:19] about her she's dying and she was in
[2:03:22] such Agony that her eyes
[2:03:24] crossed brother brah said she looked at
[2:03:27] me and she was suffering so hard to one
[2:03:30] of those little baby eyes her little
[2:03:32] eyes was crossed like that and looked at
[2:03:34] her suffering soul and she was looked
[2:03:36] like she was trying to reach her little
[2:03:39] hands to me and it just tore my heart
[2:03:41] out of me and I thought oh God and he
[2:03:44] said and from that day said that's the
[2:03:46] reason crosy children I just can't stand
[2:03:48] to look at them you know God does those
[2:03:51] things some times he has to crush
[2:03:53] something to get the good out of it
[2:03:54] isn't that right he said there's never
[2:03:57] been one pass over the platform but
[2:03:59] what's been healed too he said I didn't
[2:04:01] know the crushing had to bring it forth
[2:04:04] can you
[2:04:05] sayen you see by the sufferings that we
[2:04:09] go through God is developing us more
[2:04:13] into his image that we could reflect him
[2:04:17] that we could come into a word image a
[2:04:20] word ministry
[2:04:22] can you say Amen you love the Lord amen
[2:04:25] I thinking of
[2:04:27] Michelangelo as I close if the musicians
[2:04:30] will
[2:04:34] come Michelangelo brother Bram talks
[2:04:37] about him you know and the Masterpiece
[2:04:39] and there he he was a famous sculptor
[2:04:42] but he said every block of stone has a
[2:04:45] statue inside
[2:04:47] it and it is the task of the sculptor to
[2:04:50] discover it
[2:04:52] the the idea is there locked inside all
[2:04:55] you have to do is remove the access
[2:04:57] Stone and every block of marble I see a
[2:05:01] statue as plain as though it stood
[2:05:03] before me Shaped and perfecting
[2:05:08] attitude and action I have only to heue
[2:05:12] away the rough walls that imprison the
[2:05:14] lovely Apparition to reveal it to the
[2:05:17] other eyes as mine see it I thought why
[2:05:21] what a powerful thing God would take
[2:05:26] us rejects
[2:05:31] nobody's but what he
[2:05:33] sees he sees a beautiful thing he sees
[2:05:36] his bride he sees in his Perfect
[2:05:40] Image now he's been shaping it he's been
[2:05:43] molding it so it can come become very
[2:05:48] clear of what he is seeing now made made
[2:05:51] known to the
[2:05:53] world can you say amen
[2:05:56] amen I love the
[2:05:59] Lord we could go on and
[2:06:01] [Music]
[2:06:03] on but I don't know what you go through
[2:06:06] I don't know the things you deal with
[2:06:09] but I do want to say don't forget the
[2:06:11] [Music]
[2:06:13] commission don't forget that God is with
[2:06:16] you don't don't forget that you got an
[2:06:19] obligation to God
[2:06:20] [Music]
[2:06:25] right things are going to
[2:06:27] [Music]
[2:06:29] change there's going to be times that
[2:06:31] you're going to be in your dry
[2:06:35] spots you remember you saw the change in
[2:06:38] Elijah's
[2:06:39] Ministry at one point he was up on the
[2:06:42] mountain calling fire down from heaven
[2:06:44] what a glorious time that
[2:06:47] was and then the next moment we find him
[2:06:49] in a cave
[2:06:53] hiding
[2:06:55] scared the anointing had left
[2:06:57] [Music]
[2:06:58] him he stands there as a
[2:07:02] man and a threat of a woman to kill him
[2:07:06] was hanging over his head
[2:07:11] right but he had to find the cave to
[2:07:14] hear the voice of the
[2:07:16] Lord and He waited till he heard the
[2:07:19] voice and then he could go out once
[2:07:23] again and fulfill another part of the
[2:07:27] commission under the anointing of God
[2:07:30] can you
[2:07:31] sayen but the changes come Jesus
[2:07:35] experienced
[2:07:37] change he started out in his ministry
[2:07:39] you you know what brother brand taught
[2:07:41] it he had the first second third pool
[2:07:42] every every even brother Brandon but
[2:07:44] every with every pool come a change in
[2:07:48] in the
[2:07:49] ministry and
[2:07:52] but but not only that he Jesus started
[2:07:54] Healing The Sick working miracles that
[2:07:56] was the beginning of his ministry he was
[2:07:57] a popular man by the time his ministry
[2:08:02] changed he began to reveal himself
[2:08:05] through his Doctrine as to who he was
[2:08:08] and people began to walk away walk away
[2:08:10] walk away he went from being popular to
[2:08:13] being rejected and
[2:08:15] crucified he went from showing us how
[2:08:18] the weakest Christian could take the
[2:08:20] word of God and defeat Satan anytime
[2:08:22] anywhere under any circumstance he went
[2:08:26] from
[2:08:27] that to being wounded for our
[2:08:30] transgression and Bruise for our
[2:08:33] iniquity to hang in on a cross saying my
[2:08:36] God my God why hast Thou forsaken me but
[2:08:40] that wasn't the end of
[2:08:42] it he rose
[2:08:45] again can you say
[2:08:47] man I thought of that what if Jesus had
[2:08:50] built the complex by feeling the
[2:08:52] rejection of the people what if he had
[2:08:54] built a complex by the things he
[2:08:57] suffered what if he had been built a
[2:08:59] complex by being
[2:09:02] misunderstood we know he had to fight
[2:09:04] these complexes because the Bible says
[2:09:07] that he was tempted in every Point such
[2:09:08] as we are so he had to fight them
[2:09:12] things but he stayed with the will of
[2:09:15] God he done exactly what the will of God
[2:09:18] told him to do men misunderstood him
[2:09:21] didn't didn't didn't didn't didn't
[2:09:23] understand the whole plan but he stayed
[2:09:26] with what the father
[2:09:28] said and it come to the point that he
[2:09:30] would ask father if it be your will let
[2:09:33] this cup pass from me but nevertheless
[2:09:37] thy will be done aren't you glad aren't
[2:09:40] you glad for that aren't you glad that
[2:09:43] he could surrender himself wholly to the
[2:09:46] father if he couldn't have done that you
[2:09:48] and I wouldn't be here today
[2:09:50] [Music]
[2:09:52] but he left us an
[2:09:54] example because as he done the will of
[2:09:56] the father so must
[2:09:58] we we have our Gethsemane
[2:10:00] too we have our
[2:10:03] crosses we have our rejections we have
[2:10:06] our sufferings and we have our
[2:10:09] victories amen and the final Victory is
[2:10:12] when we put death under our
[2:10:15] feet death will not be able to touch us
[2:10:17] again aren't you glad for that amen God
[2:10:21] bless you is our prayer what's
[2:10:24] up he's got it
[2:10:27] all he's got it
[2:10:30] all in
[2:10:35] control he's got it
[2:10:38] all in
[2:10:42] control he put that reassurance
[2:10:46] [Music]
[2:10:51] look
[2:10:53] [Music]
