[22:28] hand.
[22:30] And I
[22:32] know it's going to
[22:37] rain. In a time when it was
[22:41] dry, not a cloud up in the sky. Oh, the
[22:46] children of Israel began to reason
[22:51] why. So they went to God's man cuz they
[22:58] didn't
[22:59] understand. He said, "Go look. It's
[23:03] written in the
[23:06] sky." Oh yes. Now I see a cloud like a
[23:13] man's hand.
[23:16] Oh, I see a cloud like a man's hand. Oh,
[23:24] yes. I see a cloud like a man's
[23:30] hand. And I
[23:33] know it's going to
[23:38] rain. Now they opened up the door. A
[23:43] seventh time they looked once more. Oh,
[23:47] a tiny cloud was rising from the
[23:51] [Music]
[23:53] sea. They began to
[23:57] understand. The time for rain was at
[24:01] hand. Just like
[24:03] God said it would be.
[24:09] Oh, I see a cloud like a man's
[24:15] hand. Oh, I see a cloud like a man's
[24:23] hand. Oh, I see a cloud like a man's
[24:31] hand. And I
[24:34] know it's going to rain.
[24:38] I like this. So today we had no
[24:42] fear for a cloud did
[24:46] appear. Oh, the prophet scream, "My
[24:49] bride, go through that
[24:52] door. Oh, have faith and just believe.
[24:58] Oh, a new spirit you'll
[25:01] receive. The
[25:03] rain is just about to pour.
[25:07] Oh yes, I see a clap like a man's
[25:15] hand. Oh yes, I see a cloud like a man's
[25:23] hand. Oh, I see a cloud like a man's
[25:30] hand.
[25:32] And I
[25:34] know it's going to
[25:36] [Laughter]
[25:38] rain now. The brightest looking above.
[25:43] Oh, for the chain of love to fill their
[25:48] hearts with peace they have
[25:52] never known.
[25:54] And now she's become God's unfolded
[26:00] mystery. The promise word has already
[26:05] been
[26:07] sold. Oh, I see a cloud like a man's
[26:15] hand. Yes. I see a cloud like a man's
[26:21] hand.
[26:23] Oh, I see a cloud like a man's
[26:30] hand. And I
[26:33] know it's going to
[26:36] [Laughter]
[26:38] rain. Amen. Can you give the Lord
[26:40] another hand clap of praise this
[26:43] morning? Amen.

[43:58] good to have brother Doug's friend here
[44:01] with us. God bless you. Amen. And
[44:04] um these are exciting
[44:07] times. Amen. And uh just to serve the
[44:10] Lord and knowing that we're getting
[44:12] ready to to leave this place. Amen. And
[44:16] we certainly Amen. want to know that we
[44:21] are ready to meet the Lord. Amen.
[44:24] And um uh the musicians can be
[44:28] dismissed. And uh tell you what, you
[44:32] travel around you, you just makes you
[44:34] really glad to have good musicians. And
[44:37] and uh we certainly appreciate uh uh the
[44:42] talent that is here in the church and
[44:45] and they yielding themselves to the Lord
[44:48] and to bless the bride of Christ. Amen.
[44:52] And um it's good to hear that Sister
[44:55] Jane made it through the surgery. Okay.
[44:57] And doing good. Praise the Lord. We're
[45:02] thankful for that. And Amen. And u uh we
[45:07] certainly appreciate Sister Jane. Uh if
[45:10] you have your Bibles, we're going to
[45:12] turn to the book of Psalms
[45:15] uh
[45:15] 107.
[45:18] um familiar scripture to us. Amen. Uh
[45:23] Psalms
[45:26] 107 and
[45:29] um then we'll also turn to the book of
[45:34] Romans the 12th chapter. But here in the
[45:39] 13th verse and 14th says, "Then they
[45:43] cried unto the Lord in their trouble and
[45:46] he saved them out of their
[45:48] distresses. He brought them out of
[45:51] darkness and the shadow of uh
[45:56] death and break their bands in
[45:59] sunder." Amen. And uh we really want to
[46:03] go up. Let's go to the 19th verse. Then
[46:06] they cry unto the
[46:09] Lord, and he saveth them out of their
[46:13] distresses. He sent his
[46:15] word and healed them and delivered them
[46:19] from their
[46:20] destructions. Amen. He sent his word,
[46:23] healed them, and delivered them from
[46:26] their destructions.
[46:27] Then in the book of Romans the 12th
[46:32] chapter. Amen. And we'll read verses 1
[46:36] and two.
[46:44] and says, "I beseech you therefore,
[46:46] brethren, by the mercies of God, that
[46:49] you present your bodies a living
[46:52] sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God,
[46:54] which is your reasonable
[46:56] service. And be not conformed to this
[46:59] world, but be ye transformed by the
[47:01] renewing of your mind, that you may
[47:04] prove what is that good and acceptable
[47:08] and perfect will of God." Amen. Let's
[47:12] just bow our heads in a word of prayer.
[47:16] Father, as we approach your
[47:19] word, Father, you're the only one that
[47:21] can reveal it to us and give us the
[47:25] spiritual understanding that we
[47:27] need. And we pray, Father, that you
[47:30] would do it
[47:31] today. I'm just man, just mortal,
[47:34] Father, but just asking that you would
[47:37] take these mortal lips and you would
[47:39] speak through them.
[47:41] And father, may the spirit go forth in
[47:45] the audience, Father, and quicken the
[47:48] word
[47:49] uh to them, Father, for that's what we
[47:54] need today, Lord. We just ask that you
[47:57] would draw us closer to you is our
[48:00] prayer. In Jesus Christ's name we ask.
[48:05] Amen. You can have your seats this
[48:08] morning. And if I would use a title, it'
[48:13] be the word has the power to
[48:16] transform. Amen. And I'm certainly glad
[48:21] that there is a power of transformation.
[48:24] Amen. And um the scripture here in
[48:28] Psalms, he sent his word
[48:31] uh has been standing out to me here
[48:35] lately and um because I believe that's
[48:38] what he has done in this age. Um he has
[48:40] sent his
[48:41] word and as we know uh God gives the
[48:46] best um he gives the best things to his
[48:50] people. uh he can't anything that he
[48:53] gives you us, he can't give us anything
[48:56] better because that's just the way he
[48:59] is. He's perfect to begin with. So he he
[49:03] couldn't give us anything better outside
[49:06] his word. So he gave us his word and um
[49:10] God never has to repent about nothing.
[49:13] He never has to back up on anything
[49:16] um uh because his decision is perfect.
[49:20] And so uh uh well why would then God
[49:24] send us his word? Uh because it's it's
[49:28] our defense against the enemy. And when
[49:31] we speaking of enemy, we're not speaking
[49:33] of a a country or a nation or a certain
[49:37] people, but uh we're speaking of Satan.
[49:40] Satan is our enemy. And uh it's it's so
[49:45] the word of God is our defense, but it
[49:48] is also our weapon, amen, against the
[49:52] enemy. And so as as we know that God
[49:56] fortified man by his own word uh there
[50:03] and but it's not our intellectual
[50:06] understanding of the word that fortifies
[50:09] us against against Satan.
[50:12] Uh that's that's not what we're there.
[50:15] But uh we're fortified by the word of
[50:19] God. And and the prophet said by the
[50:22] spirit of God and by the power of God.
[50:26] So we're fortified by the word of God,
[50:29] by the spirit of God, and by the power
[50:32] of God. We don't want just the word. We
[50:35] want the spirit of God and the power of
[50:38] God uh with that word. Ain't that right?
[50:42] So, in the beginning, it's just like God
[50:44] spoke and and
[50:46] uh and and when he spoke his word, then
[50:50] the spirit of God came and
[50:53] moved behind that word. And and and so
[50:58] when the word was spoken, the spirit
[51:00] brought forth the
[51:02] manifestation of the word of God and the
[51:05] power of God. uh uh and so therefore uh
[51:11] uh now many know the word intellectually
[51:14] from uh just a a
[51:18] um maybe a schooling or from what
[51:21] they've heard um and yet they remain
[51:25] under the control of Satan. There's a
[51:28] lot of people know this Bible. There's a
[51:29] lot of people that have have read this
[51:32] Bible through and through and yet still
[51:35] under the control of the devil and and
[51:38] we know what the devil does. He's the
[51:41] one that destroys homes. He he wrecks
[51:44] lives and uh you know just just all
[51:49] kinds of things that Satan does. So God
[51:53] sends his word, but the word is no good
[51:58] unless we believe it. You've got to
[52:00] believe the word. You you we could sit
[52:03] in church all of our lives, hear the
[52:06] word, and the word will do us no good if
[52:10] we don't believe it. And Eve is a prime
[52:13] example of that because they they she
[52:17] and Adam was fortified by the word of
[52:19] God. Satan could not touch them. He
[52:23] could not do nothing to them until she
[52:26] disbelieved God's word. So then the word
[52:30] of God is important to us. I know I know
[52:33] that uh uh you know in Pentecost we we
[52:36] put more emphasis on the music than we
[52:38] did the word of God. We put more
[52:41] emphasis on on things. And so people put
[52:44] more emphasis on on their dress and
[52:46] dressing nice and and uh you know making
[52:50] sure everything matches and their hair
[52:52] is right and and it more than they do
[52:54] the word of God. Or they put more
[52:57] emphasis on playing the right song and
[52:59] and and and making sure everything just
[53:02] sounds real good and and that's fine,
[53:05] but but that can't supersede the word of
[53:08] God. Uh um so so we we can emphasize a
[53:12] lot of things and and put the word on
[53:15] the back burner, but the word of God, it
[53:18] was important to God. It was important
[53:20] enough for him to give it to us. And so
[53:22] it ought to be important for us to
[53:24] receive it. Ain't that right?
[53:27] See, if we didn't have the word of God,
[53:30] then then Satan would be able to do
[53:32] anything that he desired to do of us. If
[53:36] if we didn't have that word, see, and so
[53:39] then then and if we don't believe the
[53:43] word that God has sent to us, then we
[53:46] open the doors for Satan to do anything
[53:48] he wants with us. And so the word of God
[53:52] again is the standard. It's it's it's
[53:55] the thing that that uh uh keeps Satan at
[53:59] bay. Now, you know, we all go through
[54:02] trials and and tribulations and things
[54:05] and but that does not mean and I I know
[54:08] sometimes it seems it that way, but it
[54:11] does not mean that Satan is able to have
[54:13] his way with us. You say, "Well, I've
[54:16] been believing the word and I'm still
[54:17] going through trials and and hardships."
[54:20] But but that does not mean that does not
[54:23] mean that Satan is having his way with
[54:25] you. See, God promised that we would go
[54:27] through trials. You believe that? He
[54:30] promised it. So, so trials shouldn't be
[54:33] a a uh a surprise. Amen. But but trials
[54:38] does not always mean that that we're
[54:42] being punished or that God has forsaken
[54:45] us or that we've done something wrong or
[54:49] whatever. Uh if you look in Deuteronomy
[54:52] 8 and5, I'm going to just read some
[54:54] scriptures here. But the Lord said to
[54:56] Israel, "Thou shalt also consider in
[54:59] thine heart that as a man chastineth his
[55:02] son, so the Lord thy God chastineth
[55:06] thee." Ain't that right? He also said
[55:10] unto them, "Thou shalt remember all the
[55:13] way which the Lord thy God led thee
[55:16] these 40 years in the wilderness to
[55:18] humble thee, and to prove thee, and to
[55:22] know what was in thine heart, whether
[55:25] thou wouldest keep his commandments or
[55:28] no." Ain't that right? So then then we
[55:31] find that that God has reasons
[55:36] uh uh for the trials. Amen. Now, Hebrews
[55:40] 12 and6 uh through 111. Whom the Lord
[55:44] loveth, he chastineth and scourgeth
[55:47] every son whom he receiveth.
[55:50] If everybody say if. That's a big word.
[55:54] If you endure chastening, then God
[55:57] dealeth with you as sons. Ain't that
[56:00] right? But you got to go through the
[56:02] chastening. See? And and so for what son
[56:07] is he whom the father chasteneth not?
[56:10] But if you be without
[56:12] chastisement whereof all are partakers.
[56:16] All are partakers. Ain't that right? So
[56:18] there's not one Christian that does not
[56:21] go through trials.
[56:24] Amen. And tribulations and that is not
[56:26] chasened. But if you be without
[56:29] chastisement, in other words, you can't
[56:31] stand that correction and and and God
[56:34] can't have his way with you in what he's
[56:37] trying to do with you, then he says,
[56:40] then you are bastards and not sons. In
[56:43] other words, you're illegitimate. You're
[56:45] none of his. See, furthermore, we have
[56:48] had fathers of our flesh, which
[56:50] corrected us, and we gave them
[56:52] reverence. Shall we not much uh uh
[56:56] rather be in subjection unto the father
[56:59] of spirits and live? For they verilely
[57:02] for a few days chasened us after their
[57:05] own pleasure, but he God for our profit.
[57:11] Can you say amen? So, so the chastening
[57:14] that man does is totally different than
[57:17] the chastening that God does. man does
[57:20] it for a totally different reason than a
[57:23] lot of times. And and this is what he's
[57:25] saying. For they verilely uh uh uh for a
[57:28] few days chasened us after their own
[57:30] pleasure, but he our for our profit that
[57:34] we might be partakers of his
[57:37] holiness. Now, no chastening for the
[57:40] present uh seemth to be joyous but
[57:43] grievious. Ain't that right? It's in
[57:46] them times that Satan starts uh uh
[57:48] putting things in our mind and and
[57:50] causing us to think uh well, God doesn't
[57:52] love us. God is away from us. God ain't
[57:54] answering us. I've done this and I've
[57:56] done that or or somebody else has done
[57:59] this and some there and so so God's
[58:01] punishing us. And that's not always
[58:03] true.
[58:05] Ain't that right? See, so no chastening
[58:08] for the presence seems to be joyous but
[58:10] grievious nevertheless. Afterward, it
[58:13] yieldth the peaceable fruit of
[58:15] righteousness unto them which are
[58:18] exercised thereby. So, Brother Brham
[58:20] says, "Oh, everyone that's ever
[58:22] experienced the birth of an eagle
[58:25] yourself being one of Jehovah's
[58:27] eagllets, you know what I'm talking
[58:29] about. Trials and
[58:31] tribulations." Ain't that right? See,
[58:34] Almighty God taken his own son into the
[58:37] wilderness and turned the devil loose on
[58:40] him. See, and and and sure, every and
[58:44] every son that cometh to God is tried
[58:47] and chasened of God,
[58:51] ain't that right? Trials and
[58:53] tribulations, get bankrupt, everything
[58:56] go wrong, lose your business, lose your
[58:58] friends, your friends walk away from
[59:00] you. a sticker here and a sticker there.
[59:03] See, just remember God's testing you.
[59:08] God's going to do something for you.
[59:10] Don't lose that that that thought. Now,
[59:13] in your trial, keep in mind, God's going
[59:18] to do something for you.
[59:20] Ain't that right? See, so another place,
[59:24] God throws trials and tribulations on
[59:27] you. Every son that cometh to God must
[59:31] be tried and chasened of God. He don't
[59:35] want you to get adjusted to this world.
[59:37] Maybe he throws you on a bed of
[59:39] sickness. Maybe he let you have heart
[59:42] trouble. A sticker. Everywhere you turn,
[59:44] there's a sticker. Ain't that right?
[59:46] Now, now it's easy. It's easy for people
[59:49] to find fault when someone's going
[59:52] through the trial. It's easy when you're
[59:54] standing on the outside and you're
[59:57] looking at someone going through things
[59:59] and and and you're thinking, "Why can't
[1:00:01] they get their life together? What what
[1:00:03] what's going on here? And why can't
[1:00:05] Well, let me offer them some vice or
[1:00:06] we'll correct them. We'll rebuke them.
[1:00:08] We'll do everything we can because we
[1:00:11] feel like they need our our blessing.
[1:00:13] They need our help, our advice." See,
[1:00:15] and and it shows the lack of
[1:00:17] spirituality because they don't
[1:00:19] understand they're actually in God's
[1:00:21] hands. And God is doing something and
[1:00:25] he's sending them through these things
[1:00:27] for a reason. Can you say amen? See, and
[1:00:30] so it when you when you're looking at
[1:00:32] someone in the trial, it or when you're
[1:00:35] looking even at the church and they're
[1:00:37] going and it seem like they ain't going
[1:00:38] anywhere and all these things, it kind
[1:00:40] of makes uh people on the outside that
[1:00:43] uh uh kind of feel a little bit more
[1:00:45] spiritual and and really that's not it.
[1:00:49] It's just that they they they they're
[1:00:51] going through things and that's why you
[1:00:52] got to bear with them. Ain't that right?
[1:00:54] You bear with them. You bear with one
[1:00:56] another when they're going through the
[1:00:57] trials and the tribulations and all
[1:00:59] these things. And because we as as uh
[1:01:02] people of understanding and know the way
[1:01:04] of God, we know that God is putting them
[1:01:08] to the test. Whether it's an individual,
[1:01:11] whether it's a home, whether it's a
[1:01:12] church, whether it's a preacher, whether
[1:01:14] it's the deacon, whether it's mom and
[1:01:16] dad, child, or whatever, God's going to
[1:01:19] put us to the test.
[1:01:22] Ain't that right? See, and so now Job
[1:01:24] had to deal with the faultfinders and
[1:01:27] and these things and and uh the his
[1:01:30] accusers. See, and and and they couldn't
[1:01:33] help it. Amen. That they would
[1:01:34] criticize. It's just in their nature to
[1:01:36] do that. Amen. See, and so uh uh Job was
[1:01:40] criticized or accused of being a secret
[1:01:43] sinner. Prophet said by his own by by
[1:01:47] his own church members. And they accused
[1:01:50] Job of being a secret sinner like they
[1:01:53] might accuse this woman here in the
[1:01:55] wheelchair. He's saying, see, and the
[1:01:58] young man there on the bed, the little
[1:02:00] child and the father standing
[1:02:02] there maybe being a secret sinner. Oh,
[1:02:04] you've done something. But that's not
[1:02:06] always the case.
[1:02:08] Ain't that right? See, so people may be
[1:02:11] going through sickness. They may be
[1:02:12] going through uh losing everything that
[1:02:14] they've got. And you cannot just put
[1:02:17] that amen to well, God's punishing them
[1:02:20] and oh, they've done something horrible,
[1:02:23] you know, and all that because not every
[1:02:25] trial is a result of somebody sinning.
[1:02:29] That's right.
[1:02:32] So, you know, the Bible mentions that
[1:02:34] man that was blind from birth and and
[1:02:39] some thought that he or his parents had
[1:02:43] sinned that that caused this this
[1:02:46] blindness. But Jesus said neither of
[1:02:48] them had committed this sin. See, none
[1:02:51] of them. But he says this. Jesus says
[1:02:54] the man was born blind so that the works
[1:02:56] of God might be made manifest in him and
[1:03:00] at that time and at that season God uh
[1:03:05] gave that man his his eyesight. Ain't
[1:03:08] that right? Brother Bram tells of the
[1:03:11] story of of uh uh the the time he was
[1:03:15] called to pray for a a baby that had
[1:03:18] died and in in Germany and and uh the
[1:03:23] woman's husband was stationed there in
[1:03:26] the army and and things and so uh the
[1:03:29] baby was just born and I guess and it
[1:03:31] had died uh sometime during the night.
[1:03:34] So it was a a few hours uh passed dead
[1:03:40] uh before they knew it and and the
[1:03:42] mother had given the doctor of that that
[1:03:45] book a prophet visit South Africa
[1:03:48] beforehand and so he had been reading it
[1:03:51] and things and and so when they realized
[1:03:53] that the baby had died she she told that
[1:03:56] doctor she said God's going to raise my
[1:03:58] baby up. God's going to raise my baby up
[1:04:01] and and said, "I I I want to get a hold
[1:04:04] of uh uh brother Brandham, which he was
[1:04:07] in the States at that time, and and
[1:04:09] said, I I want to, you know, uh get a
[1:04:12] hold of him and have him to come and
[1:04:13] pray for the baby." And well, they tried
[1:04:16] to get a hold of Brother Brandham, I
[1:04:17] think five times or so, and and wasn't
[1:04:19] able to. And so, the doctor told her, he
[1:04:21] says, "You know what? I'll I'm going to
[1:04:23] put I'll put that baby on life support
[1:04:25] and I'll keep it on life support and
[1:04:27] until he comes and and so the baby uh uh
[1:04:32] was on on uh the machine for 2 days uh
[1:04:38] uh and while they were waiting and
[1:04:40] brother Brandham he says this he says I
[1:04:43] was over here praying uh they finally
[1:04:45] got a hold of him and so he said well
[1:04:47] let me pray about it and he said they
[1:04:50] they already had a jet and and
[1:04:52] everything ready. And he said, "I could
[1:04:54] leave here with an army jet and be back
[1:04:56] the same day to Germany." And he says,
[1:04:58] "And one morning about daylight, I got
[1:05:00] up and the wife went out of the room and
[1:05:03] and I just awakened and I laying there a
[1:05:06] little bit directly. I heard something
[1:05:08] coming into the room and I looked and
[1:05:09] there was something moving in the room.
[1:05:11] I jumped up and I said, "Lord, what
[1:05:13] would you have your servant to know?"
[1:05:15] And and uh he said, "Do not rebuke that.
[1:05:18] That's the hand of the Lord." Now, could
[1:05:21] you imagine that? Baby's dying or or has
[1:05:25] already passed. The mom's believing and
[1:05:28] and looking to be prayed and the angel
[1:05:31] of the Lord is uh saying, "Don't don't
[1:05:34] touch that. Don't rebuke that. Uh it's
[1:05:36] it's the Lord in this." And and so um he
[1:05:41] said, "I got got her on the phone." I
[1:05:43] said, "No, God has called your baby."
[1:05:46] So, you know, so he refused to go and of
[1:05:49] course they buried the baby and all
[1:05:51] these things and then she come back in
[1:05:53] the United States and got to talk with
[1:05:55] brother Brandham and and she asked him,
[1:05:57] she goes, "Well, what was it, Brother
[1:05:59] Brandham? Uh, did what was it my
[1:06:01] weakness of faith?" And and so Satan's
[1:06:04] already plaguing her, "Well, you didn't
[1:06:06] have faith and and this and that." And
[1:06:08] he says, "Oh, no." He said, "You have
[1:06:10] great faith. You prayed for your baby.
[1:06:13] You and your husband held on to that.
[1:06:15] God raised that baby. See, and he
[1:06:18] refused to do it because he knows what's
[1:06:21] best.
[1:06:23] Can you say amen? I I don't know why God
[1:06:26] puts us through things. I don't know why
[1:06:28] you're in the situation you're in, but
[1:06:30] God knows what's best. I don't know why
[1:06:33] the church is in its in the predicament
[1:06:35] and situations it goes through, but God
[1:06:38] knows what's best.
[1:06:40] Ain't that right? And so, uh, we he
[1:06:43] says, see, uh, and he he knows what's
[1:06:46] best and you still love him. That's real
[1:06:51] faith. Anybody when the mountains are
[1:06:54] moving and things can have faith, but
[1:06:56] let it go backwards one time and see how
[1:06:59] it works. That's when you prove whether
[1:07:01] you got faith or not. Can you say amen?
[1:07:05] You're going to give up when the
[1:07:06] troubles come. You're going to just go
[1:07:08] wacko when the troubles come. Oh, it's
[1:07:11] easy to worship. It's easy to be
[1:07:13] identified with the group. Amen. That
[1:07:16] that that everything is going great.
[1:07:18] It's easy to profess God then. It's easy
[1:07:21] to worship then. But when let it go
[1:07:24] backwards when everything is coming
[1:07:26] against us, then then that's where you
[1:07:28] prove if you've got faith or not. So
[1:07:31] every son that cometh to God must be
[1:07:33] chasened and tried of God. So remember,
[1:07:37] our trials work patience and patience
[1:07:40] works hope and so forth. So we just hold
[1:07:44] on to God whether he blesses us or not.
[1:07:48] We are right there to believe him anyhow
[1:07:52] because he's promised it. Can you say
[1:07:55] amen? So when Job went through his
[1:07:57] trial, we find even his wife turned
[1:08:00] against it. Uh him telling him to curse
[1:08:03] God and die. And then Job's three
[1:08:05] friends uh uh you know uh the ones that
[1:08:08] kind of felt more spiritual than Job uh
[1:08:11] uh uh they turned it they turned their
[1:08:13] backs on him for seven days talking
[1:08:16] about friends right and probably sending
[1:08:18] him texts and all that. Job you not had
[1:08:20] you boy you done it then you know you
[1:08:23] should be doing this and you should be
[1:08:24] doing that and you should be doing that.
[1:08:26] Just leave Job
[1:08:27] alone. You know what I'm saying? Just
[1:08:30] leave Job alone. God's got his hands on
[1:08:33] him. God knows exactly what he's doing.
[1:08:36] See, and so they turned Job's uh Job's
[1:08:39] friends turned their back on him and
[1:08:40] accused him and and all of these things
[1:08:43] and and and but then the prophet said
[1:08:45] God sent a young man by the name of
[1:08:49] Elahu to talk with Job. And God didn't
[1:08:52] send him to accuse Job. God knew that
[1:08:55] Job wasn't guilty. God knew that Job
[1:08:58] wasn't at fault. He's the one that
[1:09:00] allowed Satan to put Job in that
[1:09:02] situation. So he sent a young man by the
[1:09:05] name of Elahoo, a man not not to accuse
[1:09:09] him, but he told of told told him of
[1:09:12] someone who would come and stand in the
[1:09:15] breach in the last days to put his hands
[1:09:18] upon a sinful man and upon a holy God
[1:09:21] and bridge the way. And the prophet said
[1:09:24] when when Elohim Elohim revealed that to
[1:09:27] him, Job stood up and said, "Though
[1:09:29] these skinw worms eat my flesh, I shall
[1:09:32] see my redeemer." Amen. See, and and so
[1:09:36] it's it's not that that you're going
[1:09:39] through things that God's against you.
[1:09:41] You just got to hang in there. Keep your
[1:09:44] faith. Oh yeah. Job had faith. Job Job
[1:09:48] stayed true. For he said, "Though God
[1:09:49] slay me, yet God yet will I serve him. I
[1:09:53] came into this world with nothing, I'll
[1:09:54] leave this world with nothing." Amen.
[1:09:57] The Lord giveth, the Lord taketh away.
[1:09:59] Blessed be the name of the Lord in the
[1:10:01] trials. Can you say amen? Oh, God help
[1:10:05] us. So, first Peter 4:12, beloved, think
[1:10:10] it not strange concerning the fiery
[1:10:12] trial, which is to try you as though
[1:10:14] some strange thing happened to you.
[1:10:16] Amen. And don't think it as something
[1:10:19] strange. We expect these things to
[1:10:21] happen, but we hold on to God. Can you
[1:10:24] say amen? See, so so it the trials
[1:10:27] doesn't mean that Satan's able to have
[1:10:29] his way with you and destroy you and and
[1:10:32] to take you from the hands of God and
[1:10:34] and to separate you from the love of
[1:10:37] God. He's not able to do that. God is
[1:10:40] allowing it to bring you closer.
[1:10:45] So, so as though don't don't you know
[1:10:48] think it not strange concerning the
[1:10:50] fiery trial which is to try you as
[1:10:52] though some strange thing happened to
[1:10:54] you but rejoice in as much as you are
[1:10:58] partakers. Rejoice in as much as you are
[1:11:02] partakers of Christ's sufferings that
[1:11:04] when his glory shall be revealed you may
[1:11:06] be glad also with exceeding joy.
[1:11:11] James 1:2, "My brethren, count it all
[1:11:13] joy when you fall in diverse
[1:11:15] temptations." Amen. Different
[1:11:16] temptations, and knowing this, that the
[1:11:18] trying of your faith workketh patience.
[1:11:20] But let patience have her perfect work.
[1:11:24] See, that you may be perfect or complete
[1:11:28] and entire, lacking nothing.
[1:11:32] Ain't that right? John 16:33 Jesus says,
[1:11:35] "These things have I spoken to you that
[1:11:38] in that in me you might have peace. In
[1:11:41] the world you shall you shall have
[1:11:44] tribulation." Not in the world you might
[1:11:47] have tribulation. You know, keep your
[1:11:49] fingers crossed, rub the rabbit foot for
[1:11:51] good luck. No, you shall have
[1:11:54] tribulation, but be of good cheer. Can
[1:11:57] you say amen? Be of good cheer. I have
[1:12:00] overcome the world. In other words,
[1:12:03] Satan ain't going to get you. Satan
[1:12:04] ain't going to be able to destroy you.
[1:12:06] Amen. I'm just allowing these things for
[1:12:09] a reason. I've I've got my hand upon you
[1:12:12] and I've overcome the world. And Satan
[1:12:14] is nothing but a bluff. He's defeated.
[1:12:17] He can't do nothing but what I allow him
[1:12:19] to do.
[1:12:21] I've overcome the world. Can you say
[1:12:23] amen? Amen. Acts 14:21. And when they
[1:12:27] had preached the gospel to that city and
[1:12:30] had taught many, they returned again to
[1:12:32] Lististra and and the other one and the
[1:12:35] other or and and Antioch. I can I can
[1:12:37] pronounce that one. And and confirming
[1:12:39] the souls of the disciples, notice, and
[1:12:42] exhorting them to continue in the faith
[1:12:45] and that we must through much
[1:12:48] tribulation enter into the kingdom of
[1:12:50] God. So the prophet says, "We ask for
[1:12:53] comfort and peace. God gives us the best
[1:12:56] he could give us. Trials and
[1:12:58] tribulations. That's better than comfort
[1:13:01] and peace. Don't ask me how that's
[1:13:03] better. Just trust God that it's better.
[1:13:06] God knows what he's doing with your
[1:13:08] life. Can you say amen? So, we must not
[1:13:10] cry. We must not let that spirit of
[1:13:13] depression overwhelm us to where we just
[1:13:16] can't lift our head up anymore and
[1:13:18] rejoice. Remember, we must rejoice in
[1:13:21] the trials because it's not the devil
[1:13:24] that is having his way with us. It's God
[1:13:27] allowing him to do something or to us to
[1:13:31] go through these things. Amen. To make
[1:13:33] us more perfect in him. Can you say
[1:13:35] amen? Our comfort is just beyond the
[1:13:39] river. Can you say amen? The Bible also
[1:13:43] tells us to rejoice in hope, to be
[1:13:45] patient in tribulation, continuing
[1:13:48] instant in prayer. Can you say amen?
[1:13:52] Amen. So, we could go on about these
[1:13:54] these these things. Amen. I uh I I
[1:13:59] thought like Paul in Romans 5:1.
[1:14:02] Therefore, being justified by faith, we
[1:14:04] have peace with God through our Lord
[1:14:05] Jesus Christ, by whom also we have
[1:14:08] access by faith into this grace wherein
[1:14:10] we stand and rejoice in hope of the
[1:14:13] glory of God. And not only so, but we
[1:14:16] glory. Everybody say, we glory. We glory
[1:14:20] in tribulations. We glory in
[1:14:23] tribulations knowing knowing. Now, if
[1:14:27] you're entering your your your
[1:14:28] tribulation not knowing anything, not
[1:14:31] knowing that God is with you, not
[1:14:32] knowing that God is still faithful to
[1:14:34] you, can you say amen? You got to have
[1:14:37] confidence in the blood. You got to have
[1:14:39] confidence in the promises of God. You
[1:14:42] got to know who you are. Amen. But we
[1:14:45] glory in tribulations also knowing that
[1:14:49] tribulation workketh patience. It does
[1:14:52] not work destruction. It workketh uh uh
[1:14:56] patience and patience experience and
[1:14:59] experience hope. Can you say amen? If
[1:15:02] there's a people that ought to glory in
[1:15:04] their tribulation, it's you and I. We
[1:15:07] don't ask for tribulation. Believe me,
[1:15:09] God will send them to you. He'll send
[1:15:12] the trial, but knowing that God is Goded
[1:15:16] in control.
[1:15:19] Brother Brham said, "You have to have a
[1:15:21] crucifixion before you can have a
[1:15:22] resurrection." Right. Amen. He goes on
[1:15:25] to say, "And before the church will ever
[1:15:27] be able to see a resurrected power,
[1:15:30] before I can see a new ministry take
[1:15:32] place myself, before you can ever enter
[1:15:35] into a fellowship with God, there's got
[1:15:37] to be a self crucifixion so that there
[1:15:40] can come a resurrection." Can you say
[1:15:43] amen? Amen. And the trials are there for
[1:15:45] us to die out to oursel, humble oursel,
[1:15:49] humble ourselves to his word and say,
[1:15:51] "God, just have me." Amen. It's not my
[1:15:54] will. Amen. I thought I had it all taken
[1:15:56] care of, but it's beyond me now. I
[1:15:58] thought I I thought I had the steering
[1:16:00] wheel, but I realize I ain't got
[1:16:03] everything's going crazy for me. I just
[1:16:05] need you, God. Die out to yourself. Die
[1:16:08] out to your will. Die out to your
[1:16:10] thoughts. Die out the way you think it
[1:16:13] ought to be. and let God have his way.
[1:16:18] See, there's got to be a self-
[1:16:20] crucifixion so that there can come a
[1:16:22] resurrection. We got to die out to our
[1:16:24] own thoughts, die out to our own ways,
[1:16:26] die out to everything that's around us,
[1:16:28] go through trials and tribulations that
[1:16:30] we might see a new resurrection, a new
[1:16:33] life. Can you say amen? Now, we we
[1:16:37] understand the Bible tells us that there
[1:16:40] will be those that'll fall away through
[1:16:41] the trials because they have not been
[1:16:44] rooted. Matthew 13:20, Jesus said, "But
[1:16:48] he that receiveth the seed into stony
[1:16:51] places." There's four types of grounds,
[1:16:54] right? And one of those grounds is a
[1:16:56] stony place, a stony heart. See, they
[1:16:58] they got their heart hardened. See, he
[1:17:01] that receiveth the seed into stony
[1:17:03] places, the same as he that heareth the
[1:17:05] word, and anan with joy receiveth it. So
[1:17:09] they hear the word, and with joy they
[1:17:11] receive it. Oh, thank God. Thank God.
[1:17:13] Thank God. Right? And yet hath he no
[1:17:16] root in himself, but dareth for a while.
[1:17:20] For when tribulation or persecution
[1:17:22] aristh because of the word by and by, he
[1:17:26] is offended. Ain't that right? See, so
[1:17:29] we don't want to be that type of ground.
[1:17:31] So trials are to be expected. You will
[1:17:34] go through them. I can't preach it uh uh
[1:17:37] good enough for to keep you out of it.
[1:17:39] You can't be good enough to stay out of
[1:17:41] it. You're going through the trials.
[1:17:43] You're going through the tribulation.
[1:17:46] And as brother Josiah says, suck it up.
[1:17:53] We got to get tough, right?
[1:18:00] So trials are to be
[1:18:03] expected, but Satan is limited to what
[1:18:08] he can do because of the word of God.
[1:18:12] Ain't that right? God sent his
[1:18:15] word. He sent his word as a fortress.
[1:18:19] Could you imagine if you didn't have the
[1:18:20] word?
[1:18:22] Could you imagine what Satan would be
[1:18:24] able to do if you did not have the
[1:18:26] promises?
[1:18:29] We We think we got it bad now. We could
[1:18:32] be an insane asylum. We We could be
[1:18:35] overdosing. We We could Amen. be all
[1:18:38] wrecked up.
[1:18:43] Amen. Now, every every child of God is
[1:18:47] predestinated by God. The bride is
[1:18:50] predestinated. And this word
[1:18:53] predestinated means to for ordain by
[1:18:56] divine will or
[1:18:58] decree to determine beforehand.
[1:19:02] So So God predestinated that that's what
[1:19:06] the Bible says. Amen. We were
[1:19:10] predestinated before the foundation of
[1:19:12] the world. Now I'm getting to what kind
[1:19:13] of word he sent to us. We were
[1:19:16] predestinated before the foundation of
[1:19:18] the world. If if if we could put it to a
[1:19:22] time of some type of a time, it was
[1:19:25] millions and millions and millions and
[1:19:27] millions of years. Amen. Ago that we
[1:19:30] were
[1:19:31] predestinated. But but it was we were
[1:19:34] predestinated before time. Amen. So
[1:19:37] there was no time limit. See, we were in
[1:19:40] God. God is eternal. He's self-existent.
[1:19:42] He's always existed. And it's hard for
[1:19:45] us to to fathom in our carnal mind, our
[1:19:48] our human mind, how that was possible.
[1:19:51] But but God's always been and and with
[1:19:54] God has been his thoughts. Amen. His
[1:19:58] thoughts are eternal, never beginning,
[1:20:01] never having an ending. Can you say
[1:20:02] amen? See, and and so we were in God's
[1:20:06] thoughts, the the elect. See, so uh uh
[1:20:10] uh those who are of the royal seed are
[1:20:12] the elect of God. Ain't that right? Are
[1:20:15] the predestinated fornown of God and
[1:20:18] were in the mind of God and his
[1:20:20] thoughts. In very plain language, the
[1:20:23] true bride of Christ was in the mind of
[1:20:26] God
[1:20:27] eternally, though not expressed until
[1:20:30] each came forth in the designated decree
[1:20:33] season. Ain't that right? So, so we we
[1:20:37] we're a thought of God. That's the
[1:20:39] attribute of God. And as we know then
[1:20:43] then God spoke a word. A word is an
[1:20:47] expression of a thought. You can't speak
[1:20:49] it unless you think it first. And and
[1:20:52] your thoughts are so uh um uh can come
[1:20:56] unconsciously. Amen. That that but
[1:20:59] you're speaking it. Amen. And so you you
[1:21:02] you A word is a thought
[1:21:05] expressed. Ain't that right? See, so God
[1:21:09] thought it, then he spoke it, and now
[1:21:12] it's becoming material. So Jesus himself
[1:21:16] was a predestinated creature of time. He
[1:21:20] was the lamb slain before the foundation
[1:21:22] world. That's what the Bible says that
[1:21:24] the lamb was slain before time began,
[1:21:27] before the world began, before man had
[1:21:30] ever been created. The lamb was slain.
[1:21:34] How was he slain? In the thought of God.
[1:21:36] in the mind of God. It was all right
[1:21:38] there. Ain't that right? See, and so
[1:21:41] then we find out that that lamb Jesus
[1:21:44] being that predestinated creature of
[1:21:46] time, he was the prophet that Moses
[1:21:48] spoke of. He was the woman's seed that
[1:21:51] was promised to Eve. He was the holy one
[1:21:53] that David spoke of that would not see
[1:21:55] corruption. Amen. See, so the word the
[1:21:59] word declared what he would be, what he
[1:22:02] would do, and how he would act.
[1:22:06] It was already there. The before he ever
[1:22:09] became man, Jesus Christ become
[1:22:12] manifested in flesh. Amen. Before he
[1:22:15] ever, Amen. walked upon the earth, there
[1:22:18] was a word concerning him.
[1:22:23] Can you say amen? Amen. That's right.
[1:22:26] That's why the woman at the well when
[1:22:28] Jesus came to her and done the Messiah
[1:22:30] sign, she said, "Sir, we know that when
[1:22:32] the Messiah cometh, he will do those
[1:22:35] things." How did she know he would do
[1:22:37] these things? Because there was a word
[1:22:39] that foretold of him and what he would
[1:22:42] do. Therefore, when he did it, she
[1:22:45] recognized that this is the Messiah that
[1:22:48] was promised in the word.
[1:22:51] [Applause]
[1:22:53] See, so he was the predestinated word.
[1:22:57] Now, what is the word? It's a word of
[1:22:59] promise. This word is a word of promise.
[1:23:03] And and the word of promise goes back
[1:23:05] into the mind of God. Thoughts of God.
[1:23:08] Amen. And so he he he planned it in his
[1:23:12] mind. Can you say amen? That's right.
[1:23:15] See? Amen. Now, it's a word of promise
[1:23:18] because it's impossible. The Bible says
[1:23:20] it's impossible for God to lie. Ain't
[1:23:23] that right? Amen. Another place God
[1:23:25] says, "My word shall not return unto me
[1:23:27] void, but it shall accomplish that which
[1:23:30] I sent it to do." Therefore, his word is
[1:23:34] a word of promise. Amen. God thought it.
[1:23:38] He expressed it in the word and it
[1:23:40] became a promise.
[1:23:45] Well, what is a promise? It's a
[1:23:47] declaration that one will do something.
[1:23:50] It's it's a pledge to do it to bring it
[1:23:53] about or provide. So God promised it.
[1:23:57] Ain't that right? When he said there's
[1:23:59] going to be a bride without spot,
[1:24:01] wrinkle, or blemish, that wasn't just a
[1:24:03] wishbone. It was in the mind of God to
[1:24:05] have a bride without spot, wrinkle, or
[1:24:07] blemish. He spoke a bride and said it
[1:24:10] will be. And he because he spoke it, he
[1:24:13] promised to provide it.
[1:24:16] He promised it. Ain't that right? See, a
[1:24:19] promise is a legally binding declaration
[1:24:22] that gives the person to whom it is made
[1:24:25] a right to expect or to claim.
[1:24:29] That's what Webster says. A promise is a
[1:24:33] legal binding declaration that gives the
[1:24:35] person to whom it is made to a right to
[1:24:40] expect it or to claim it. claim the
[1:24:42] performance or the forbearance of a
[1:24:45] specified act. Can you say amen? Amen.
[1:24:49] You wasn't promised to be a sinner, but
[1:24:51] you was a promised to be a Christian.
[1:24:53] You wasn't promised to go to hell. You
[1:24:55] was promised a heaven. Can you say amen?
[1:24:59] You wasn't promised to live in defeat.
[1:25:01] You were promised to live in victory.
[1:25:04] And you have a right to declare it. You
[1:25:05] have a right to expect it. You have a
[1:25:07] right to claim it. It's the word of God.
[1:25:10] Hallelujah. It's a promise. Can you say
[1:25:12] amen? And the Bible says we are children
[1:25:15] of promise.
[1:25:18] We're children of promise. In other
[1:25:20] words, our beginning does goes beyond
[1:25:22] just the genes of my daddy. My beginning
[1:25:25] goes in the mind of God. Amen. Before
[1:25:28] the foundation of the world, he thought
[1:25:30] of me. He spoke his word about me. And
[1:25:33] I'm a child of promise.
[1:25:42] The Bible says there in Romans that they
[1:25:44] which are the children of fle of the
[1:25:46] flesh are not the children of God. It's
[1:25:48] the children of promise that is counted
[1:25:52] for seed.
[1:25:54] Now see the Bible tells us, Paul tells
[1:25:57] us in Ephesians that God chose us in
[1:26:01] Christ before the foundation of the
[1:26:03] world.
[1:26:05] Ain't that right?
[1:26:07] Why did he choose? He chose us. We were
[1:26:10] chosen to be holy and perfect.
[1:26:14] It's a promise that God made. He thought
[1:26:17] it. He spoke it. That became a promise.
[1:26:22] And God cannot lie. Ain't that right.
[1:26:26] Amen. That's That's right. So now we
[1:26:28] have a right to claim it. We have a
[1:26:30] right. Devil says, "Oh, you're going to
[1:26:32] go to hell. You're going to go to this."
[1:26:34] No, no, no. I' I've got a right to claim
[1:26:36] heaven. I've got a right to claim a
[1:26:38] rapture. I've got a right to claim my
[1:26:40] healing. I've got a right because it's a
[1:26:44] promise to me.
[1:26:47] Hallelujah. Praise the Lord. Brother
[1:26:50] Brham said, 'If God before the world
[1:26:52] ordained that we should be holy and
[1:26:54] without blame and perfect in the sight
[1:26:55] of God and we struggling and
[1:27:00] murmuring and don't you think God seen
[1:27:02] all those things and he forneew it and
[1:27:06] predestined ordained us to be so elected
[1:27:09] us before the world was ever formed. Can
[1:27:12] you say amen?
[1:27:14] You
[1:27:15] know, you may be
[1:27:17] struggling. You may be but remember
[1:27:20] there there's there it even takes a
[1:27:22] struggle. Remember the the the the egg
[1:27:26] the chicken in the egg. It you you can't
[1:27:30] you can't crack that egg and have a
[1:27:32] birth. It the the birth has to come from
[1:27:35] struggle inside the egg. Yeah. Yeah.
[1:27:39] He's promised to be a chicken. He's he's
[1:27:42] got all the potentials there.
[1:27:44] But now he's right there in an egg. But
[1:27:47] something in that life is calling to
[1:27:50] come forth and express itself to what
[1:27:52] it's supposed to be. It isn't supposed
[1:27:55] to be an egg yolk. It's not supposed to
[1:27:57] be. That's just the beginning of it. But
[1:28:00] then it takes a struggle and he has to
[1:28:01] peck and peck and peck his way through
[1:28:05] the struggles. Can you say amen?
[1:28:09] That's right.
[1:28:11] So we have a right to come under
[1:28:13] expectation for God to fulfill his word.
[1:28:16] We have a right to claim to lay claim to
[1:28:19] the promise. God gave Abraham a promise.
[1:28:23] And and notice uh the prophet said, "I
[1:28:26] don't care what comer to Abraham." He
[1:28:29] stayed right with that word of promise.
[1:28:32] He just stayed right with it. See, you
[1:28:35] see the word become Abraham's
[1:28:38] protector. Yes. Yes. Yes, I know he was
[1:28:41] getting weak. And I know he was getting
[1:28:43] older. And I know Sarah, Amen, her her
[1:28:46] womb was dead. And and and and all of
[1:28:48] these things and and everything spoke
[1:28:51] around him spoke contrary to the
[1:28:52] promise. But Abraham fortified himself
[1:28:55] to the promise. He didn't lose hope.
[1:28:59] He didn't live life like it was
[1:29:01] helpless. He didn't live life like
[1:29:04] everything was just hopeless and he's
[1:29:06] just doomed for destruction.
[1:29:10] He was fortified by that word. Satan
[1:29:14] couldn't get to his mind. Satan couldn't
[1:29:15] get to him whatsoever. There was a word
[1:29:18] and he clung to that word of promise.
[1:29:23] No matter how Sarah come, others come,
[1:29:25] different ones come, everything. He
[1:29:27] counted it as though it
[1:29:30] wasn't. He looked at every negative
[1:29:32] thing around as though it wasn't. Why?
[1:29:35] He had a promise. Can you say amen? God
[1:29:38] sent his word to Abraham for a promise.
[1:29:41] And Abraham drew strength off that
[1:29:43] promise. Abraham lived off that promise.
[1:29:46] Abraham's faith grew stronger by that
[1:29:49] promise.
[1:29:55] He looked, he believed that he could see
[1:29:58] the promise because God promised it to
[1:30:00] him and that was all there was to it. It
[1:30:02] was God's word and it stayed right in
[1:30:05] him.
[1:30:06] Now, we didn't come, as you all know, we
[1:30:09] didn't come the way God predestinated
[1:30:12] us. We come contrary to what God thought
[1:30:15] of
[1:30:17] us. We come born as sinners, wretched,
[1:30:20] miserable
[1:30:22] brats. No
[1:30:24] good, afflicted by the devil, whether it
[1:30:28] be in this body or whether it be in our
[1:30:30] soul or spirit.
[1:30:36] scarred, right?
[1:30:39] Having these habits that was sinful,
[1:30:44] ungodly, bound by the devil, couldn't
[1:30:47] quit. So many people try to quit their
[1:30:49] smoking. Just a little old little old
[1:30:51] stick. See these big old tough men that
[1:30:54] can just just do anything and they can't
[1:30:57] even give up that little old thing. It's
[1:31:01] a spirit that's got them bound. It's a
[1:31:03] spirit of nicotine. They can't get rid
[1:31:06] of the pornography. They can't get rid
[1:31:08] of the lust. They can't they can't get
[1:31:09] rid of that bottle.
[1:31:16] So now Satan's got them saying, "Well,
[1:31:17] God loves me just the way I am. I'm a
[1:31:20] Christian. Bless God." Blankety blank
[1:31:22] blank
[1:31:25] blank. They're bound by the devil.
[1:31:29] Can you say amen? Yes, you can live
[1:31:32] above these things. You can live above
[1:31:34] sin. You can live above the filth of
[1:31:37] this world. You can live amen in an age
[1:31:41] of leosia and not be partaker of
[1:31:43] leotysa.
[1:31:44] You can do it. See? Amen.
[1:31:49] But we didn't come the way God
[1:31:51] predestinated us to be. And God wanted
[1:31:54] it that way. Believe it or not, God
[1:31:56] wanted it to be that way.
[1:31:59] We were born sinners, right? But that's
[1:32:02] not the end of our story. And to be
[1:32:04] honest, that's not the beginning of our
[1:32:06] story.
[1:32:08] Ain't that right? See, our beginning
[1:32:10] started with us being an attribute of
[1:32:13] God. Amen. See, Jesus again started as
[1:32:16] an attribute of God. The prophet said
[1:32:18] Jesus was the son of God from before the
[1:32:21] foundation of the world. The attribute
[1:32:23] of God. See another place it was an an
[1:32:26] attribute first was in God that he
[1:32:29] thought of himself as being human and
[1:32:32] that transmitted him down to be
[1:32:35] Jesus. Ain't that right? Now, Brother
[1:32:39] Brandham shows the difference between us
[1:32:41] and and and and
[1:32:45] Jesus. He says the difference between
[1:32:47] him and you as a son. Jesus was the son
[1:32:50] of God. You're a son.
[1:32:54] But the difference between him and and
[1:32:57] us he was at the beginning the word an
[1:33:00] amorpha body came in and lived in that
[1:33:03] in the person of
[1:33:04] Melzdc and then later we never heard of
[1:33:07] no more of Melzdc because he became
[1:33:09] Jesus Christ.
[1:33:11] See, so he becomes he he came from being
[1:33:14] an attribute, a thought to word, body.
[1:33:18] That's what that's what stood before
[1:33:20] Abraham that
[1:33:22] day. And then later on became flesh.
[1:33:26] That word became flesh. See? So see his
[1:33:29] first being was spirit, God,
[1:33:31] supernatural. All right? The great
[1:33:33] eternal. Second, he began to form
[1:33:36] himself towards flesh in a theophony and
[1:33:39] it's called the word a body. Another
[1:33:43] place the attribute was first God the
[1:33:45] thought the attribute itself all in one
[1:33:48] without being expressed just God with
[1:33:51] his
[1:33:52] thoughts his his attributes
[1:33:56] wasn't expressed yet in the word then
[1:33:59] when he expressed secondarily he became
[1:34:03] them the
[1:34:04] word and then the word was made flesh
[1:34:07] and dwelt among us
[1:34:09] when Jesus died Bible says He went to
[1:34:12] hell and preached to the souls that were
[1:34:13] lost. Ain't that right? Well, how did he
[1:34:17] do
[1:34:18] that? He had turned back into a
[1:34:20] theophony.
[1:34:23] Ain't that right? The word body. Now,
[1:34:26] notice this body isn't the only body
[1:34:28] that we have. According to the Bible, 2
[1:34:33] Corinthians 5:1, for we know that if our
[1:34:36] earthly house, this whole body of this
[1:34:39] tabernacle were
[1:34:41] dissolved, if if today I die and and you
[1:34:45] you you're having a memorial service and
[1:34:48] my body's laying there in a casket.
[1:34:50] That's just the tabernacle. I'm not
[1:34:51] there.
[1:34:54] But what happens to me? I go to another
[1:34:56] body,
[1:34:58] right? So if this body was to turn back
[1:35:01] into dust and and and
[1:35:04] dissolve, we have another.
[1:35:07] We have a building of God and house not
[1:35:11] made with hands eternal in the heavens.
[1:35:14] This didn't come through through a sex
[1:35:16] act. It it didn't come from our parent.
[1:35:18] This is an eternal body, a theophony, a
[1:35:22] word body. So we have another body. It's
[1:35:25] it's a word body. But notice we bypassed
[1:35:28] that.
[1:35:32] Jesus came from attribute to theophony
[1:35:34] to
[1:35:35] flesh. We bypassed that. And we went
[1:35:39] from attribute to being attribute to
[1:35:42] flesh. We come straight from God. The
[1:35:46] attribute to be flesh to be tempted and
[1:35:50] tested by sin like Adam did. But notice,
[1:35:56] but when testing of his word is over,
[1:36:00] when the testings and the trials of life
[1:36:02] are over, then we are taken up to this
[1:36:06] body that was prepared for us before the
[1:36:09] foundation of the world. It is the word
[1:36:11] there that we skipped to come right
[1:36:13] around down here to be tempted and
[1:36:16] tested. Say, God's God knows what he's
[1:36:19] doing for us.
[1:36:22] Now, if we had come through that, there
[1:36:24] had been no temptation. We'd know all
[1:36:26] things. That's the reason Jesus knowed
[1:36:28] all things because he was word before he
[1:36:31] was flesh. Then then we become the word,
[1:36:34] right? So if we couldn't be tempted if
[1:36:37] if we knowed all things,
[1:36:44] but we didn't know all things. We don't
[1:36:45] know all things. So Satan can tempt us.
[1:36:50] He can try to get us to curse God. He
[1:36:52] can try to get us to curse our future.
[1:36:54] He could try to get us to doubt our
[1:36:57] future. He could try to get us to doubt
[1:36:59] that we are sons of God, daughters of
[1:37:02] God. But we have to take God at his
[1:37:04] word.
[1:37:07] Can you say amen? Here, here we are
[1:37:11] formed to the word image to be partaker
[1:37:14] of the word, feed on the word. Ain't
[1:37:17] that right? by pred being predestinated
[1:37:20] since the beginning. You see that little
[1:37:22] spark of life that you had in you from
[1:37:24] the beginning when you started your
[1:37:26] journey. He said see many of you can
[1:37:28] remember you joined this church and
[1:37:30] joined that church. You tried this and
[1:37:32] tried that but nothing satisfied but
[1:37:35] that one day but one day you just
[1:37:37] recognized it. See you you come like
[1:37:41] Adam another place you come like Adam
[1:37:43] like me you became from the attribute to
[1:37:46] the flesh to be tempted
[1:37:49] that's what we all go through
[1:37:50] temptations
[1:37:54] we have never become the word we've just
[1:37:57] become the flesh man not the word
[1:38:01] another place you see in order to stand
[1:38:04] temptation you had to bypass the
[1:38:06] theophony
[1:38:08] you had to come down here in flesh to be
[1:38:11] tempted by sin. It's an all It's all in
[1:38:16] God's plan.
[1:38:18] Hello. He allowed this to happen for you
[1:38:23] to be tempted of the devil to you to be
[1:38:25] afflicted and for to go through the
[1:38:28] trials and the tribulations and all
[1:38:30] that. But he never forgot his word
[1:38:34] concerning you.
[1:38:37] That's right.
[1:38:39] Praise the Lord. Here another place
[1:38:41] before the foundation of the world his
[1:38:43] name is put on the lamb's book of life.
[1:38:45] Then from that he become the word the
[1:38:47] theophony that could appear and
[1:38:48] disappear. And then he become flesh and
[1:38:51] returned back again resurrected that
[1:38:53] same body in a glorified condition. But
[1:38:56] you bypass the theophony and become
[1:38:58] flesh man to be tempted by sin.
[1:39:02] But notice the
[1:39:05] Christian, the
[1:39:07] Christian is God's thoughts or God's
[1:39:10] thoughts is the Christian of
[1:39:13] today because you are an attribute of
[1:39:16] God. Can you say amen? So, so God
[1:39:20] allowed you to go through these things.
[1:39:22] He allowed us to be born in sin, to be
[1:39:24] afflicted, and to be tempted and to be
[1:39:27] tested and to be tried. He allowed us to
[1:39:30] go through these to feel the agony and
[1:39:33] to feel the pain and and all these
[1:39:35] things. But notice, but Jesus
[1:39:38] came. The prophet said Jesus came to
[1:39:41] break the clouds back so that attribute
[1:39:44] could display itself.
[1:39:48] Can you say amen? To show to the devil
[1:39:50] that you can do whatever you want to
[1:39:52] with these people, but they're still
[1:39:54] mine. I've claimed them and I what I
[1:39:59] thought of them to be, that's what they
[1:40:01] are and that's what they'll manifest.
[1:40:04] Can you say amen? So, so he come to
[1:40:07] break those clouds of darkness so that
[1:40:11] you the attribute could manifest itself.
[1:40:15] That's it. He's he is God's expressed
[1:40:18] word. Now, nothing could be manifesting.
[1:40:20] Other characters had all fallen. Then
[1:40:22] you see what did uh what did Jesus come
[1:40:25] to bring back those characters. No, they
[1:40:27] were born in sin shape and iniquity. He
[1:40:30] came as a
[1:40:32] redeemer and to redeem anything is to
[1:40:34] bring it back. Ain't that right? Amen.
[1:40:38] See, in other words, he he didn't just
[1:40:40] go shopping. As I've said before, you
[1:40:43] know, you you well, all of us like to
[1:40:46] shop in one way or another. Uh you you
[1:40:49] ladies like Kmart and Walmart and us
[1:40:52] guys like the gun shops and stuff like
[1:40:55] that, but you go
[1:40:58] shopping and you buy something new.
[1:41:00] Well, you're you're not redeeming.
[1:41:03] You're just buying something new.
[1:41:06] You could break something in your
[1:41:09] home and let's say you could break a
[1:41:12] plate or a glass or whatever and you
[1:41:15] say, "Well, I'm going to go get another
[1:41:17] one." You could go go to the store and
[1:41:20] get one just like that one and that's
[1:41:24] still not redeeming because you're
[1:41:26] replacing it. It could be just exactly
[1:41:29] alike, the same print, the same
[1:41:30] everything, same shape, everything. And
[1:41:33] yet it's not redeeming it. You just
[1:41:36] replaced it.
[1:41:38] The only way you could redeem is to take
[1:41:41] that shattered glass that is scattered
[1:41:44] everywhere and take every little piece
[1:41:48] and put it all back together and make it
[1:41:51] look like it had never been broken.
[1:41:56] There's not one of us that knows how to
[1:41:57] redeem. We couldn't. But he came to
[1:42:01] redeem.
[1:42:02] Can you say amen?
[1:42:04] See, and and so it was God's thought.
[1:42:07] You think little you, little me. See, no
[1:42:11] one in the world could take my place.
[1:42:12] Nobody can take yours. You being a
[1:42:14] Christian filled with the spirit of God
[1:42:16] and before the foundation of the world,
[1:42:18] God saw you and know every feature that
[1:42:20] you got. And Jesus come to bring you
[1:42:23] back. Aren't you glad for that? That's
[1:42:26] what Jesus was here for. The redeemer,
[1:42:28] the human body was to bring you back.
[1:42:31] that that had to come to be a human as a
[1:42:34] redeemer to display the his attributes
[1:42:37] as savior come to redeem you and bring
[1:42:40] you back to where you came from.
[1:42:46] Now this is what brings us to our
[1:42:48] opening scripture in Romans and be not
[1:42:51] conformed to this world but be ye
[1:42:54] transformed by the renewing of your
[1:42:56] mind.
[1:42:58] Brother Brandham in the power of
[1:43:00] transformation. I was just listening to
[1:43:02] it couldn't sleep. So just listening to
[1:43:06] this and he said now that we have been
[1:43:08] saved as we are and that we have been
[1:43:12] filled with the Holy Spirit as we have
[1:43:16] now we want the mind that was in Christ
[1:43:20] to be in us. Amen. that we might be
[1:43:23] transformed from the natural things of
[1:43:26] life and be brought in to do the perfect
[1:43:29] will of God by transformation of God's
[1:43:33] spirit by his word.
[1:43:37] Can you say amen?
[1:43:39] Not not to be a Christian filled with
[1:43:41] the Holy Ghost and continuing in the
[1:43:44] same life.
[1:43:46] But now we're being transformed.
[1:43:50] Hello. from sinner to saint, from from
[1:43:54] from unholy to holy. Everything now what
[1:43:59] God had in his mind is now taking an
[1:44:03] effect in us and we're being transformed
[1:44:06] into that.
[1:44:09] Yes,
[1:44:10] sir. And the transformation takes place
[1:44:14] by the renewing of your mind. See the
[1:44:16] things that you once thought upon to be
[1:44:19] precious, lay that aside. Amen. Can you
[1:44:23] say amen? The things that you once
[1:44:25] thought to be precious out in this
[1:44:27] world, lay that aside.
[1:44:29] Amen. There there you got two different
[1:44:32] diets. There's a there's a diet that the
[1:44:34] world does. They feed off the filthy
[1:44:36] jokes. They feed off the carnal things
[1:44:38] of life. And that's all they feed on is
[1:44:41] just that that that you know what so and
[1:44:43] so did what so and so said and and
[1:44:45] they're negative and all these things
[1:44:47] and and the that that's all they feed
[1:44:49] upon. But a Christian now turns his mind
[1:44:53] his thoughts to something else.
[1:44:58] Turns his thoughts to the word which is
[1:45:01] an expression of God's thoughts.
[1:45:05] And now he begins to take the word which
[1:45:08] is God's thoughts expressed and he
[1:45:10] begins to meditate upon them. God said
[1:45:13] by his stripes I'm healed. Amen. Can you
[1:45:16] say amen? I am victorious. The God says
[1:45:20] there will be an overcomer and I am that
[1:45:24] overcomer. See what you're doing is
[1:45:26] you're putting yourself now in the mind
[1:45:28] of God. The thoughts that God had, God
[1:45:32] sent down to you in word form that you
[1:45:36] might take it into you and be
[1:45:38] transformed.
[1:45:42] That's good.
[1:45:47] The things that you once thought upon to
[1:45:49] be precious, lay that aside and be
[1:45:50] transformed to something else. What you
[1:45:53] was one time to what you are now. Can
[1:45:57] you say amen? Is this all right?
[1:45:59] So what is the word? Brother Brham said
[1:46:02] the very thing that God spoke before the
[1:46:04] foundation word give down to the
[1:46:07] prophets. That's all. See it's his
[1:46:09] spoken word that he spoke in the
[1:46:10] beginning. That's what the word is. It's
[1:46:13] God's word that he spoke in the
[1:46:14] beginning in now in word form written
[1:46:18] written word. The prophet said the Holy
[1:46:21] Spirit come down and just see uh uh uh
[1:46:24] spoke the word through the prophets as
[1:46:26] they wrote in on the book that God spoke
[1:46:29] before the foundation of the world. In
[1:46:31] the beginning was the word. Ain't that
[1:46:33] right? So So the word see God was
[1:46:35] declaring amen uh the end from the
[1:46:39] beginning. God God isn't there just
[1:46:41] through time waiting for things to
[1:46:43] transpire and then he speaks his word.
[1:46:45] He's already spoke it. He called you
[1:46:48] back then. He justified you back then.
[1:46:50] He already glorified you back then.
[1:46:53] That's what the Bible says. Whom he
[1:46:55] forno, he did predestinate. And whom he
[1:46:58] did predestinate, he did uh uh uh he
[1:47:02] called. And whom he called, he
[1:47:04] justified. And whom he justified, he
[1:47:06] glorified. God done that before the
[1:47:08] foundation of the world.
[1:47:13] Ain't that right?
[1:47:16] So, so the Bible is just the
[1:47:20] prophet to by the gift of
[1:47:24] knowledge to foresee what God spoke
[1:47:27] before the foundation of the world. So,
[1:47:30] this lets us know what God thought. This
[1:47:32] is all God's thoughts written down. Can
[1:47:35] you say amen? This is all God's
[1:47:38] thoughts. No wonder people don't like
[1:47:39] this Bible. Satan don't want you to read
[1:47:41] this Bible. You ought to read your Bible
[1:47:43] daily.
[1:47:45] Can you say amen? Amen. No excuses.
[1:47:50] You shouldn't get too busy to read this
[1:47:52] word.
[1:47:53] Ain't a Ain't that right now? Now Now
[1:47:56] that's for all of us. Amen. From the
[1:47:58] preacher all the way down. And Satan
[1:48:00] will try to get us busy. We're living in
[1:48:02] a busy age where we go go go go and
[1:48:04] hardly get nothing done. We have every
[1:48:07] excuse if if if if we you know I I just
[1:48:10] went, you know, got back from Alaska.
[1:48:12] Never got dark.
[1:48:15] Never got dark.
[1:48:17] So, we landed in in Alaska in Anchorage
[1:48:20] at 10 that night and then Faith and I
[1:48:25] got something to eat and we we got to
[1:48:27] the pastor's house close to 11:00 and as
[1:48:29] we were almost close there, we saw a guy
[1:48:32] out there watering his
[1:48:35] yard at 11:00 at night. Why not? It's
[1:48:39] daylight, right?
[1:48:43] We will always be
[1:48:45] busy if if we just had more time. I
[1:48:48] mean, it was strange going to bed in the
[1:48:50] daytime.
[1:48:53] But Satan will keep us busy, but and and
[1:48:56] you'll you'll be busy till you die. Take
[1:48:58] time to read the word of God.
[1:49:01] Take time to pray. Take time to meditate
[1:49:04] upon the word of God.
[1:49:07] Get off the phones. Get off the
[1:49:10] Facebook. Get out of the movies. Get out
[1:49:13] of your books. Get every down to the
[1:49:16] place to where you can. This book
[1:49:18] becomes the most important thing to you.
[1:49:21] Can you say amen? Spending time with God
[1:49:24] becomes more. And you women can do it
[1:49:26] too.
[1:49:28] Amen. If Suzanne Wesley can do it,
[1:49:30] having 17 children and pray two hours a
[1:49:33] day, we can do it as well.
[1:49:37] That's right.
[1:49:39] Can you say amen?
[1:49:41] See, so, so the Bible lets us foresee
[1:49:44] what God thought. Ain't that right? See,
[1:49:48] it's the very thoughts that God had
[1:49:50] before the foundation of the world,
[1:49:51] expressed them in word, dropped them
[1:49:54] down to the prophets, and they wrote
[1:49:56] them. That is the only thing it is. Now,
[1:49:58] it just has to unfold. And it is
[1:50:01] unfolding. See, ain't that right? Do you
[1:50:04] love him? Now see, so when God speaks a
[1:50:07] word, he could never go back on it. So
[1:50:09] as long as it remained in his thinking,
[1:50:12] in his mind as just a thought, well,
[1:50:15] nothing would have transpired. Nothing
[1:50:16] would have happened. See, but once he
[1:50:19] spoke,
[1:50:20] it changed
[1:50:23] everything. He could have thought, I
[1:50:25] want light. I want light. I see light. I
[1:50:29] know there's going to be light. I want
[1:50:31] light. And it would remain
[1:50:33] dark. until he spoke the word, let there
[1:50:36] be light. And when he spoke that word,
[1:50:40] the spirit of God channeled by that word
[1:50:44] and brought forth light. Ain't that
[1:50:46] right? Now, I'm going to close in just a
[1:50:49] minute, but you listen now. We only got
[1:50:50] one one service
[1:50:53] today. We are living in the age of the
[1:50:56] open book. Amen. Right.
[1:51:00] The mighty angel has come down with an
[1:51:02] open book according to Revelations 10
[1:51:06] and1 which is
[1:51:09] Christ only it could be and has given it
[1:51:13] to the seventh angel to reveal it to his
[1:51:18] people. Come down gave the book to that
[1:51:20] seventh angel so it could be revealed to
[1:51:22] the
[1:51:23] people. The Bible talks about seven
[1:51:26] thunders uttering their voice. The seven
[1:51:28] thunders have uttered their voice. The
[1:51:31] message of the hour. The seventh angel
[1:51:34] has sounded and the mysteries of God are
[1:51:36] revealed. You'll find it all in
[1:51:38] Revelations 10:1 all the whole chapter.
[1:51:42] The perfect will of God. The what was in
[1:51:45] God's mind as a thought has and and and
[1:51:48] written in the word in symbolic form has
[1:51:51] now been revealed to you and I.
[1:51:56] feed off this message. Feed off that
[1:51:59] word. Now notice now what is our part
[1:52:03] now. Oh my. So we come into the message
[1:52:07] and just still remain with habits and we
[1:52:09] come into the message still just you
[1:52:11] know acting like ought to living like
[1:52:14] everybody else and having all this
[1:52:16] unbelief hanging on us and and you know
[1:52:20] we just living below our privileges and
[1:52:23] you know and all these things. No, not
[1:52:26] not according to the prophecy.
[1:52:29] Revelations 10:8. And the voice which I
[1:52:31] heard from heaven spake unto me again
[1:52:34] and said, "Go take that go and take the
[1:52:36] little book which is open in the hand of
[1:52:38] the angel which standeth upon the sea
[1:52:41] and upon the earth." And I went unto the
[1:52:44] angel and said unto him, "Give me the
[1:52:45] little book." And he said, "Take it un"
[1:52:47] And he said unto me, "Take it and eat it
[1:52:49] up, and it shall make thy belly bitter,
[1:52:51] but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as
[1:52:53] honey." And I took the little book out
[1:52:55] of the angel's hands and ate it up. And
[1:52:58] it was in my mouth sweet as honey. And
[1:53:00] as soon as I had eaten it up or eaten
[1:53:02] it, my belly was bitter. And he said
[1:53:04] unto me, "Thou must prophesy again
[1:53:06] before many peoples, nations, tongues,
[1:53:08] and kings." Can you say amen? So John
[1:53:12] eating the book was symbolic of him
[1:53:14] believing every word of it. You're not
[1:53:18] here to eat this book. You know, uh uh
[1:53:20] you ain't want to do that. Uh uh but
[1:53:23] believe every word of it. Now John was
[1:53:26] represented us. He was a type of the
[1:53:28] bride of today. Ain't that right? You
[1:53:30] you we are not to sit here and just
[1:53:32] learn the quotes and oh that was nice
[1:53:35] and oh I wish he'd hurry up and I just
[1:53:37] wish you've got to have this word being
[1:53:39] effective in you. And the only way it
[1:53:41] can be effective in you is you believe
[1:53:43] the word. God sent his word to to heal
[1:53:47] the sick. Amen. and to and and and and
[1:53:50] to to deliver them from destruction. Can
[1:53:53] you say amen? He he sent his word, but
[1:53:56] now here we are in the response. We are
[1:53:59] to eat the book. Believe every word.
[1:54:05] Now Jesus said if we add to it, add one
[1:54:08] word to this or take one word from it,
[1:54:09] our part is taken out of the book of
[1:54:12] life. See, not one scripture. We must
[1:54:14] take it just the way it's written. Man
[1:54:17] is to live by every word that proceedth
[1:54:19] out of the mouth of God. That's what
[1:54:20] Jesus said. Ain't that right? Also,
[1:54:23] eating the book was symbolic of becoming
[1:54:25] the book. Ezekiel, Amen. 2:8 says, "But
[1:54:30] thou, son of man, hear what I say unto
[1:54:32] thee. Be not thou rebellious like that
[1:54:35] rebellious house." Can you say amen?
[1:54:37] Amen. and message people, don't you let
[1:54:40] your hearts be hardened and rebellious
[1:54:42] and and have a rebellious spirit like
[1:54:44] like the world out there. Hello, church.
[1:54:48] Amen. See, but he says, see, open thy
[1:54:50] mouth and eat that I give thee. And when
[1:54:53] I looked, behold, and hand was sent unto
[1:54:56] me, and lo, a roll of a book was
[1:54:59] therein, a scroll, and he spread it
[1:55:02] before me, and it was written within and
[1:55:04] without. Amen. And there was written
[1:55:07] therein lamentations and mournings and
[1:55:09] woe. And before and moreover he said
[1:55:11] unto me, son of man, eat that thou
[1:55:14] findest. Eat this roll and go speak unto
[1:55:18] the house of Israel. So I opened my
[1:55:20] mouth. And he did cause me to eat that
[1:55:22] roll. And he said unto me, son of man,
[1:55:24] cause thy belly to eat and fill thy
[1:55:26] boughels with this row that I give thee.
[1:55:29] Then did I eat and it was in my mouth as
[1:55:32] sweet for or as honey for sweetness.
[1:55:34] Ain't that right? Amen. So, so brother
[1:55:37] Brand tells us now what what the prophet
[1:55:39] was doing. Amen. When he ate the book,
[1:55:42] he and the scroll became one.
[1:55:45] Can you say amen? He and the word, he
[1:55:48] and the prophecy became one. Amen. And
[1:55:51] what are we doing? The prophet said, see
[1:55:53] that's the believer when he receives the
[1:55:55] Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit wrote the
[1:55:57] Bible and the spirit of God is the word
[1:56:00] of God. My words are spirit. In the
[1:56:02] beginning was the word. The word was
[1:56:04] with God. The word was God. And the word
[1:56:07] was made flesh and dwelt among us.
[1:56:09] Hebrews 13:8. He's the same yesterday,
[1:56:12] today, and forever. And when you are a
[1:56:14] part of that word, oh, then let
[1:56:17] something come up contrary to that word.
[1:56:19] Brother Bram snaps his fingers and said,
[1:56:21] "There's a little buzzard sets off right
[1:56:23] quick." It's to warn you that death is
[1:56:26] in the road. We should never do that. No
[1:56:28] matter what a church says or what a
[1:56:31] church would say, no matter what anybody
[1:56:32] else would say, if you're born of the
[1:56:34] spirit of God, you become part of the
[1:56:38] Bible. In other words, what God thought,
[1:56:41] Amen, in his mind and expressed it in
[1:56:43] the word and had it written down, now we
[1:56:46] are becoming the manifestation of it.
[1:56:49] We're becoming one with God's thoughts.
[1:56:52] Can you say amen? God sent his word to
[1:56:56] deliver from destruction.
[1:56:59] Well, do you love him?
[1:57:03] Now the word is now being made manifest.
[1:57:06] Yes, sir. You are the book. Amen. You
[1:57:09] are the attributes of God. You are the
[1:57:11] word. You are the You are well Paul
[1:57:14] would call it the living epistles.
[1:57:17] You are living epistles.
[1:57:19] Can you say amen? Written and known of
[1:57:22] all men. Amen. And what is it? The
[1:57:24] spirit follows the word like it did in
[1:57:26] the beginning. See, the word is the
[1:57:29] conductor of the
[1:57:30] spirit. Amen. The word conductor, it's
[1:57:33] it's a material or object that permits
[1:57:36] an electric current to flow easily. A
[1:57:40] material capable of transmitting another
[1:57:42] form of energy. Say that again. A
[1:57:45] conductor is a material or object that
[1:57:47] permits an electric current to flow
[1:57:50] easily. a material capable of
[1:57:53] transmitting another form of energy.
[1:57:56] See, so the word is the
[1:57:59] conductor. When you receive the word,
[1:58:02] the spirit of God comes in us. Amen. And
[1:58:05] starts flowing through that word. Amen.
[1:58:08] And goes to work for us and brings every
[1:58:11] promise of God to pass. Can you say
[1:58:13] amen? Claim that word. Don't you doubt
[1:58:16] this word one bit. Don't let Satan take
[1:58:19] that word and cause you to disbelieve
[1:58:21] your weapon. This weapon is the only
[1:58:23] thing you've got. It's the very thing
[1:58:25] that's going to transfer. The power of
[1:58:27] transformation lays in this word. Do you
[1:58:29] believe that?
[1:58:31] You see, the word of God is is is is
[1:58:34] God's thoughts in seed form. Ain't that
[1:58:37] right? Amen. See, and and
[1:58:40] so if if you look, Jesus told us to go
[1:58:44] preach the gospel. Go preach the gospel.
[1:58:47] You know, brother Bram said there's
[1:58:49] there's a difference in in
[1:58:51] in
[1:58:55] preaching or the word and then the
[1:58:59] gospel. He said, see, he said, if you
[1:59:02] were to ask me for an acorn tree and I
[1:59:04] give you an acorn, then potentially you
[1:59:07] have an acorn
[1:59:09] tree. Why? Because the acorn is the
[1:59:12] seed. So, I want to I want a tree. Well,
[1:59:15] go for the seed first. Get you a seed,
[1:59:18] plant it in the
[1:59:20] ground, and you'll have your tree,
[1:59:23] right? So, so, oh, so we say, "Oh, I
[1:59:27] want to be a Christian. Oh, I want to be
[1:59:28] an overcomer. Oh, I want to go in a
[1:59:29] rapture. Oh, I want to be healed. Oh, I
[1:59:31] I I I want to receive a body change. Oh,
[1:59:34] I I just want to live overcoming life.
[1:59:36] And oh, I just want this and I want that
[1:59:38] and I want this." Well, if it's in God's
[1:59:41] thoughts, well, God's thoughts are right
[1:59:44] here in word form. And you have to
[1:59:47] receive this, right? It's seed right
[1:59:50] here. This is the seed, right? So now,
[1:59:53] now notice we are commanded to preach
[1:59:55] the gospel. Brother Brian said,
[1:59:57] preaching the word is the
[1:59:59] acorn, but making it live is the gospel.
[2:00:05] Can you say amen?
[2:00:07] Preaching the word is the acorn. It's
[2:00:10] what we're doing today.
[2:00:14] But the gospel is when the word is
[2:00:16] starting to live. Amen. See,
[2:00:20] so the gospel is where the word is
[2:00:23] preached that comes to life in the
[2:00:25] people. So brother Brandham said if he
[2:00:27] promised the Holy Spirit, that's the
[2:00:29] word. Receiving the Holy Spirit is
[2:00:31] making it live, manifesting. If he
[2:00:34] promised these blessings by the word,
[2:00:36] then he's sending the word and producing
[2:00:38] what he said. That's the
[2:00:41] gospel. Well, aren't you glad for that?
[2:00:44] See, we believe in the gospel, not just
[2:00:47] preaching the word. We believe in the
[2:00:50] gospel to where the word is now taking
[2:00:53] effect upon our lives.
[2:00:56] Yes, sir. That's what the preachers are
[2:00:59] supposed to do. Preach. Sew the seeds.
[2:01:02] Sew the seeds, pass out the acorns.
[2:01:06] That's what we're doing. We're preaching
[2:01:07] promises.
[2:01:10] Amen. Not not bringing you under a legal
[2:01:14] legal thing. You can't produce promises
[2:01:16] that way. That's right. But you preach
[2:01:19] the promises handy you the acorn and
[2:01:22] watch the gospel
[2:01:24] take effect because the word see so but
[2:01:28] planting the seed will do no good if the
[2:01:30] ground wasn't prepared beforehand now we
[2:01:33] all know that right I ain't I ain't that
[2:01:35] smart but you know I I do know you you
[2:01:39] if you're going to plant a garden you
[2:01:41] just don't go out there and just start
[2:01:43] throwing seeds
[2:01:46] you have to prepare the ground,
[2:01:49] right? You have to till it up. That's
[2:01:52] the part I
[2:01:53] hate.
[2:01:56] Well, the only part I like is eating
[2:02:01] it. Pulling up them stupid
[2:02:04] weeds. Brother Jack, uh, I asked him one
[2:02:08] time, I said, "Brother Jack," you know,
[2:02:10] he was in,
[2:02:11] um, Pennsylvania and he's an older
[2:02:15] gentleman. And I said, "Brother Jack,
[2:02:16] why do you why do you pull all them
[2:02:18] weeds? Why do you take your time?" He
[2:02:19] said, "Because I never planted
[2:02:23] them. Anything I didn't plant don't
[2:02:26] belong." But you have to prepare the
[2:02:28] garden. You have to prepare it. Well,
[2:02:31] see, this is what Jesus did. Remember
[2:02:34] the seed fell on stony ground, thorny
[2:02:36] ground, the wayside, but then it also
[2:02:39] fell on good ground.
[2:02:41] Brother Brandham said, "The good ground
[2:02:42] is that heart that was pre-prepared
[2:02:46] before the foundation of the world.
[2:02:50] You was pre-prepared ground, brother
[2:02:52] Tim,
[2:02:54] for this day that when the seed would be
[2:02:57] sown, it would fall upon that good
[2:03:01] ground and it would produce exactly what
[2:03:05] God thought of you before the foundation
[2:03:08] of the world. Your faith ain't in vain.
[2:03:12] Your believing isn't in vain. Just stay
[2:03:14] right with the word. Oh, but I'm going
[2:03:17] through a hard time. But it does not
[2:03:19] mean that Satan's got his way with you.
[2:03:21] That's right. It's just the testings and
[2:03:23] the trials. But God's working something
[2:03:26] out. Be transformed by the renewing of
[2:03:30] your mind. I I know if the musicians
[2:03:31] will come, I know it gets hard. I know
[2:03:34] it gets discouraging. I know you just
[2:03:36] want to give up and throw your hands up
[2:03:38] and at that time you just want to say
[2:03:40] well what's the use of it all you know
[2:03:42] and and most usually people get
[2:03:44] discouraged and they start getting laxed
[2:03:47] you you with me now they start getting
[2:03:50] laxed don't start getting laxed
[2:03:55] I don't care if you're discouraged don't
[2:03:56] start bringing that stupid TV in your
[2:03:58] home
[2:04:03] right I'm just discouraged. So what's
[2:04:06] the use? So you spend more hours on the
[2:04:07] YouTube and all that junk and before you
[2:04:10] know it, you start wandering in things
[2:04:12] that you shouldn't. Filling your mind
[2:04:15] with all kinds of nonsense. Don't do
[2:04:17] that. Stay faithful. Amen. Stay
[2:04:21] faithful. Can you say amen? Amen.
[2:04:24] Because we know that it's just a season.
[2:04:29] It's just a season. You say, "Oh, it's a
[2:04:31] long season." I get that. But the
[2:04:34] promises are still true. The promises of
[2:04:38] God still remain the same. You tell me
[2:04:40] when God stopped fulfilling the word,
[2:04:42] then I I'll believe it. But you ain't
[2:04:44] going to prove it to me. He'll never
[2:04:46] show it to be able to show it to me
[2:04:47] because God remains faithful to his
[2:04:50] word. Can you say amen? God remains
[2:04:55] faithful. And so you press the battle
[2:04:58] regardless.
[2:05:00] All right. I trust it was a help to you.
[2:05:03] Be transformed, church. Be transformed.
[2:05:06] You say, "Well, I'm going through a
[2:05:07] trial. Is anything happening?" Oh, yeah.
[2:05:10] You're being
[2:05:11] transformed. Being transformed. You all
[2:05:14] know that story of a lady that was going
[2:05:17] by and she saw this
[2:05:19] cocoon and she saw that little little
[2:05:23] butterfly just a little little wing just
[2:05:27] a tad bit showing and it's struggling
[2:05:30] and struggling. and she thought, "Oh,
[2:05:32] poor
[2:05:33] thing." She got a something and she
[2:05:36] opened that cocoon out, uh, opened it up
[2:05:39] to where the butterfly could come
[2:05:41] out. And the butterfly just kept
[2:05:44] walking, but it never would
[2:05:48] fly. And she went whatever, talked to a
[2:05:51] specialist or whatever, said, "Why? Why
[2:05:53] won't it fly?" He said, "You've done the
[2:05:54] worst thing you could do for that thing.
[2:05:57] You've crippled
[2:05:58] it." What do you mean? I was trying to
[2:06:00] help it, but you didn't help it because
[2:06:03] see, it had to struggle. It had
[2:06:06] to. It had to come out on its own
[2:06:09] because the struggles is what
[2:06:12] strengthened its wings to fly. Now, it
[2:06:15] has no
[2:06:17] strength. And I'm going to tell you,
[2:06:19] church, it's time to
[2:06:20] fly. We're going
[2:06:23] home. And the struggles must be there
[2:06:26] for you to fly. You got it. It's God
[2:06:28] putting strength in you.
[2:06:32] Strength. Can you say amen? Teach us,
[2:06:35] Lord. Teach us to wait. Teach us to
[2:06:38] remain
[2:06:39] steady. Teach us to keep holding on. Can
[2:06:43] you say, "How many wants to fly? I want
[2:06:46] strength to fly. I I I I want to be more
[2:06:49] like him. I I I see what God's mind is
[2:06:53] now. I know what he got for me, and he
[2:06:56] wants me there. He'll never change his
[2:06:58] mind and I'll get there. But it's going
[2:07:00] to take some strength. I got to I got to
[2:07:03] go through them struggles. It takes the
[2:07:06] tears. It takes the groaning. It takes
[2:07:07] the the weeping. It takes the times of
[2:07:10] just being
[2:07:12] broken. But you're leaning upon him more
[2:07:14] and
[2:07:16] more. I love
[2:07:19] him. I love the
[2:07:23] Lord. He's so wonderful to me.
[2:07:27] Amen.
