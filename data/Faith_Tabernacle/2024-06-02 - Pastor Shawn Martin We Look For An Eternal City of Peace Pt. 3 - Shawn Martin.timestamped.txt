[43:02] the thought we look for a an eternal
[43:07] City uh of Peace amen I think that's all
[43:12] of our hearts as Christians
[43:14] Believers and uh you know we we Face
[43:18] many problems many trials in life and no
[43:22] doubt U uh you're facing challenges that
[43:26] you don't know
[43:27] what's going to happen and things like
[43:30] that but this morning if we could just
[43:32] get our eyes off of all of that and and
[43:36] just think of the promises that God has
[43:39] has given to
[43:41] us and we're so close to the coming of
[43:44] the Lord amen and brother brandham you
[43:47] know he said there's not another thing
[43:49] that I know to happen but the Rapture
[43:51] the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ it's
[43:54] already and he said that years ago go
[43:57] and and so we were looking that uh the
[44:03] the the Rapture is imminent it it can
[44:06] happen just any moment and that's what
[44:09] we want to keep on our hearts is that
[44:11] this world is not our home it's it's
[44:15] just it's not for us to to be uh
[44:19] comfortable in uh God didn't make it
[44:22] that way uh brother raham says we ask
[44:25] the Lord for give us comfort and peace
[44:27] and and he says that God sends us the
[44:30] best thing he can give us and that's
[44:31] trials and
[44:33] tribulations and he said our comfort is
[44:35] is on the other side of the river and uh
[44:39] so that that's what we're looking for
[44:42] and and so this eternal uh city of Peace
[44:46] uh it's it's um it's it's not a fairy
[44:50] tale it's we we're not just mixed up
[44:53] people that are believing this and
[44:55] looking for this to come it is real and
[44:58] it is eternal and it's it's the same
[45:02] city that Abraham looked for uh uh and
[45:07] and you know uh he was so passionate
[45:09] about it he so believed in it that he
[45:13] actually looked for that City and uh uh
[45:17] uh and and every believer has been
[45:19] looking forward to that time uh of that
[45:23] City and and so it it's here in in this
[45:27] world that every nation every Kingdom
[45:29] every Monarch every government every
[45:32] dictate um that has come on the scene
[45:36] has given away uh to another at some
[45:41] point in time it it doesn't matter how
[45:45] powerful that Nation would be if it
[45:47] would be the world leader of that of its
[45:50] time and but but it's it's given away
[45:53] it's it's it's no more because uh
[45:56] another Nation would rise and then that
[45:58] Nation would fall and another one would
[46:01] rise and and then that would fall and
[46:04] here we are uh uh we become a super
[46:07] world or a superpow and the leader of
[46:10] the world and and but look where we're
[46:13] at we're falling and uh people don't
[46:15] want to believe that but we're a
[46:17] laughing stock uh to the world and and
[46:20] it ain't going to get any better um and
[46:23] it's just it's it's it's got to fall
[46:25] just as any Other Nation and and so uh
[46:30] uh it's it's this has been a continuous
[46:33] cycle uh since the beginning of time uh
[46:38] mankind uh is has just it's eat eaten up
[46:43] with death civilization has death in it
[46:46] as as the civilization we know of uh
[46:50] science uh has death in it education
[46:53] produces death uh technology produces
[46:57] death and and we'd even say religion
[47:00] produces death and and it's it's just
[47:03] death it's it's all under the law of of
[47:07] death and and and so uh as as we know uh
[47:12] the law of death Works in man and what
[47:16] he produces uh is death and everything
[47:19] about man everything about his
[47:21] achievements it's death and and the more
[47:24] man uh get smarter and educated and the
[47:28] more inventions he makes he's only
[47:30] speeding up the process of death uh man
[47:33] is becoming weaker uh uh not just in his
[47:37] mind but in his body in his his
[47:39] spiritual life everything is is just
[47:43] it's it's because it's he's under that
[47:46] law of death and and so the reason why
[47:49] we're looking for a city that is eternal
[47:53] and and it's a city uh that that that uh
[47:57] of peace is because uh God has promised
[48:01] it to us this is a promise and I know
[48:04] what we are believing um is so contrary
[48:07] to the world of of today uh because it's
[48:11] not proven by science it's not proven by
[48:14] education it's it's not proven uh by by
[48:18] even religion uh uh but yet we still
[48:21] believe it we believe it more today than
[48:24] we've ever had before and and because
[48:27] we're closer to the time of of of uh of
[48:32] of this this event and and so uh but but
[48:36] uh so it's a real challenge for a man to
[48:38] really really not just say it but really
[48:41] believe it that that there is a city and
[48:44] and of course if he really believes it
[48:46] he's going to lay aside everything and
[48:48] and look for that City every day you go
[48:51] to work but you're looking for a city
[48:53] and and and the world's getting Wicked
[48:56] but you're you're you're you're looking
[48:57] for a city The Trials come but you're
[49:00] looking for a city amen uh nothing aases
[49:04] you because you know there's a city and
[49:08] and it's by promise God promised it and
[49:11] and we're looking for that to come and
[49:13] anything that God has promised will come
[49:15] to pass so in Genesis 20 or Revelations
[49:19] 21 and 2 uh John said that he saw this
[49:23] city and and he said it was a holy city
[49:26] uh there is not no uh uh holy city uh I
[49:30] I know they call Rome and and the world
[49:33] calls Rome a holy city and all that but
[49:35] but this is what God would call Holy
[49:37] City and that's that City that John saw
[49:40] and he called it New Jerusalem ain't
[49:43] that right and he saw this city coming
[49:45] down from heaven showing that it has no
[49:49] tithes to this earth and and and it it
[49:52] it it's not connected with the Earth for
[49:55] Paul with say about this city uh in
[49:58] Hebrews 11:10 that uh uh the Builder and
[50:02] maker of this city is God Amen it's not
[50:06] made by man it's not some group of men
[50:09] uh that would come together and uh uh uh
[50:12] but this is is is uh uh a product of
[50:16] God's making ain't that right and so so
[50:20] this this the city New Jerusalem it
[50:23] settles as as it it descends and it
[50:26] settles upon the Earth amen and and
[50:30] brother Brandon with liken it as as when
[50:33] that the the the holy spirit of God
[50:37] descended in the form of a dove from
[50:39] heaven and he come down and he settled
[50:42] Upon Jesus and and and uh you you
[50:45] remember where John said you know I I
[50:48] saw the heavens open up and the Spirit
[50:51] uh liken unto a dove uh descending upon
[50:54] him well you know Jesus was part of the
[50:57] earth and and the Holy Spirit uh
[51:01] descended and settled up on on the earth
[51:04] and and it remained upon him forever
[51:08] ain't that right it it didn't take its
[51:11] flight it remained there amen because he
[51:14] was a
[51:15] predestinated uh uh vessel he was that
[51:19] that piece of Earth was was
[51:21] predestinated and and so the prophet
[51:23] said it can never leave him it's all
[51:26] always there for he and God are one and
[51:30] so it always has to remain ain't that
[51:33] right so this holy city uh New Jerusalem
[51:37] it descends down uh uh uh uh there and
[51:42] it re settles uh upon an Earth but but
[51:47] not just the Earth but a redeemed Earth
[51:50] Amen brother Bram would say it it's the
[51:53] the entire Earth is redeemed
[51:57] and this city comes to claim every
[51:59] attribute that he made the Earth for
[52:03] amen see and so and it will never pass
[52:07] away it's there to stay this is one city
[52:10] this is one government this is one uh uh
[52:14] reain Kingdom that will never ever uh
[52:18] end now uh Jerusalem of course means
[52:21] city of Peace amen and so this Eternal
[52:25] City it's a it's a city of peace and
[52:28] that that that should mean something to
[52:30] us amen uh because uh as we've talked
[52:34] before but peace means freedom from
[52:36] disturbance it it's a a state of
[52:39] Tranquility a a period in which there is
[52:43] no War uh or a war has ended it means a
[52:48] a treaty agreeing to a ceasefire between
[52:51] Waring States uh it is freedom from
[52:55] civil disorder
[52:57] uh freedom from dispute or dissension
[53:00] between individuals or groups uh peace
[53:03] means calm restfulness freedom from
[53:07] interference it means Harmony
[53:10] agreement uh
[53:12] reconciliation so think of that now when
[53:15] there's when the city comes down a city
[53:17] appe peace amen this is what we're
[53:20] looking for there's going not going to
[53:22] be no hostility there there's not going
[53:24] to be no interference there you can
[53:27] actually worship God Amen you you can
[53:30] you can serve God you can enjoy your
[53:33] life without no interference without no
[53:37] disruption uh no fear no anxiety no
[53:41] condemnation no disorder no uh confusion
[53:46] no war no turmoil no no no mind battles
[53:50] no enemy there there's nothing there
[53:53] it's a it's a city of Peace it's
[53:56] actually real peace can you say amen
[54:00] amen and and so uh uh what what we're
[54:03] looking for is just beyond reasoning uh
[54:06] because there has to be a change that
[54:10] it's not a continuation of this life
[54:13] it's it's not a continuation of our
[54:16] policies in in government it's not a
[54:19] continuation of of politics and
[54:22] democracy and there has to be a change
[54:27] in order for that City to come can you
[54:30] say Amen now that change can only work
[54:34] through the uh or or come through the
[54:36] work of redemption and that word
[54:39] Redemption means to bring back uh to its
[54:43] original condition amen so so if if if
[54:48] Redemption has to take place then then
[54:51] uh uh and it's going to bring everything
[54:53] back to its original condition then then
[54:55] God's got a a a uh uh something that we
[55:00] can look to to see what this city and
[55:03] and the condition and all these things
[55:05] are going to be like and so uh the Book
[55:08] of Genesis as we know is the SE chapter
[55:11] and because everything started there but
[55:13] in Genesis you know is where God created
[55:16] the Garden of Eden and and placed man in
[55:19] there there was no evil uh The Lion and
[55:22] the Wolf laid down together they fed
[55:25] together the lamb would lay uh beside
[55:29] them uh it was perfect peace the prophet
[55:32] said Perfect Harmony God had it under
[55:36] his control amen God had it under his
[55:39] control ain't that right and and the
[55:41] prophet says over it all he placed his
[55:44] beloved children his son his daughter a
[55:47] husband and wife to control it so we
[55:50] know that Genesis 1: 126 God made man
[55:54] and then he gave them Dominion uh uh
[55:57] over the fish of the sea over the fowl
[55:59] of the air over the cattle of uh of the
[56:02] field and and and over all the Earth and
[56:06] over every creeping thing that creepeth
[56:09] up on the earth God gave man to be king
[56:13] of the earth ain't that right to rule to
[56:16] Reign it it was his domain see and and
[56:21] and so uh uh uh of course it would be uh
[56:25] uh uh uh a state of Peace a condition of
[56:29] Peace an atmosphere of Peace because the
[56:31] Bible says that God is the God of Peace
[56:35] amen he it's not just the peace of God
[56:37] that you have but he's the God of Peace
[56:41] amen so then God cannot create havoc and
[56:44] disorder he doesn't cause confusion amen
[56:49] uh uh anything that he does is results
[56:53] in peace can you say Amen it result
[56:56] results in peace and so it was only
[56:59] after man fell did chaos and confusion
[57:03] and disorder uh uh uh set in it's
[57:08] because man fell from his position and
[57:11] instead of ruling and reigning on the
[57:13] earth he he's now a victim of the devil
[57:18] amen and and so uh and and as we know
[57:21] there's
[57:23] absolutely no way that man could ever
[57:27] come back to that position uh on his own
[57:32] ain't that right amen Paul uh talks
[57:35] there in Hebrews and and he mentions he
[57:38] mentions a uh uh uses a phrase Eternal
[57:42] judgment Eternal judgment and and the
[57:45] prophet said see that that that tells us
[57:47] that everyone is condemned and and no
[57:51] matter what we ever do we're condemned
[57:55] that you you you can't be good enough
[57:57] Amen to to come out of this uh judgment
[58:01] it's an eternal judgment it's it's not
[58:04] just a judgment for a day it's it's not
[58:07] just a judgment for a week it's it's man
[58:10] is is forever under this eternal or
[58:13] under this judgment see we were born
[58:16] condemned our parents and not only just
[58:19] us our parents our ancestors all the way
[58:22] back to Adam uh uh and and and or Abel
[58:25] and Cain and see all condemned you know
[58:28] brother brand would tell it if you've
[58:30] never stolen a thing in your life if you
[58:32] never cheated if you never committed
[58:34] adultery if you never lied uh if you
[58:38] never done one bad thing you're still
[58:41] condemned amen you're under that
[58:43] judgment it it it there there's nothing
[58:45] you can do about it amen see because uh
[58:49] uh you know brother Brown would say that
[58:51] we're condemned before we breathed our
[58:52] first breath see uh uh see so he says we
[58:56] were judged by the sexual desire of our
[59:00] parents who through their act brought us
[59:03] here on the earth so here Psalms uh 51
[59:07] and5 it says behold I was shaken uh
[59:11] shapen and and and one writer says
[59:14] brought forth I was brought forth in
[59:17] iniquity and in sin did my mother
[59:21] conceive me ain't that right so so
[59:25] you're you're your very conception in
[59:28] the womb was uh through sin ain't that
[59:32] right see so we know uh uh this by the
[59:35] message of the hour and by the
[59:37] scriptures but Adam fail he fail by
[59:40] heeding to his wife and she fell by
[59:43] listening to Satan's reasonings and and
[59:46] and when that happened he uh Adam lost
[59:49] his right to life to eternal life for
[59:53] God said the day you eat thereof that
[59:55] day you die amen but he also lost his
[59:58] fellowship with God he lost that
[1:00:00] relationship with God and and and when
[1:00:03] he lost his life then he also lost his
[1:00:08] inheritance in life ain't that right
[1:00:11] because he had complete Supreme control
[1:00:14] of the earth amen and he was a god of
[1:00:17] the Earth the prophet said God is the
[1:00:19] god of the universe everywhere but his
[1:00:22] son had this Earth under his own control
[1:00:27] he could speak he could name he could
[1:00:29] say he could stop nature he could do
[1:00:32] anything he wanted to for he was God of
[1:00:36] this Earth amen and and it was peace
[1:00:39] there was no disturbance there was
[1:00:41] nothing there to hinder him uh uh
[1:00:45] because of his position but when he fell
[1:00:49] he lost his inheritance the Earth that's
[1:00:53] why the prophet said he lost his
[1:00:55] inheritance
[1:00:56] which was the earth and and now it was
[1:01:00] passed from his hands to the one that he
[1:01:04] solded out to and that was Satan right
[1:01:06] so Satan uh he's the he's the control of
[1:01:09] the earth he's the one that is is does
[1:01:12] and and and builds up things and and and
[1:01:16] controls the the winds and the you know
[1:01:19] uh all these tornadoes and all this
[1:01:21] hurricanes and all of these things
[1:01:24] that's that's Satan bringing all all
[1:01:26] that you see and and so um but but he uh
[1:01:30] man sold his faith in God to Satan's
[1:01:33] reasoning the prophet said therefore his
[1:01:35] eternal life his right to the Tree of
[1:01:38] Life his right to the Earth was passed
[1:01:41] from his hand to Satan see and so then
[1:01:45] ever since then Adam's seed has
[1:01:49] destroyed this Earth has destroyed the
[1:01:53] inheritance that Adam should have had
[1:01:56] and so uh as we know God promised to
[1:01:59] destroy them those that destroy the
[1:02:02] Earth look at this Revelations 11 and 18
[1:02:06] and the nations were angry and thy wrath
[1:02:09] is come and the time of the Dead that
[1:02:12] they should be judged and that thou
[1:02:15] should us give reward unto thy servants
[1:02:18] and the prophets and to the Saints and
[1:02:20] them that fear thy name small and great
[1:02:22] and should us destroy them which destroy
[1:02:26] the Earth so so the prophet said man has
[1:02:29] completely destroyed the Earth with his
[1:02:31] filth amen uh his his his uh uh murder
[1:02:37] amen he's polluted the Earth with murder
[1:02:40] and the blood of his fellow man and uh
[1:02:44] uh he's uh uh adulteries and the the the
[1:02:48] drinking and War and gambling and the
[1:02:52] whiskey and and every sin for thing look
[1:02:57] transgenders now and
[1:03:00] homosexualities and and such irreverence
[1:03:03] toward God and and all this it's
[1:03:05] polluted the Earth and not only that
[1:03:07] they've done all that look at the
[1:03:08] fracking and look at all this and look
[1:03:10] at this and I'm not into all that
[1:03:12] politics but ain't what God made that
[1:03:14] Earth for it's just the facts of it and
[1:03:17] and they're even the prophet said
[1:03:19] they're even getting into God's
[1:03:20] chemistry and and and they're making
[1:03:22] these bombs and they're making all these
[1:03:24] warheads and it's it's causing it's
[1:03:27] causing an upset in nature and all of
[1:03:29] these things they're polluting what God
[1:03:32] made this world for see this Earth
[1:03:35] wasn't made for sin do you believe that
[1:03:38] amen this Earth wasn't made for sin it
[1:03:40] was made amen for peace it was made for
[1:03:44] man to dwell together with God and and
[1:03:48] and and these things but see man thinks
[1:03:51] that he's making the earth a better
[1:03:53] place to live in brother Bram said even
[1:03:55] though the the World Council of churches
[1:03:58] uh say that they're making this earth
[1:04:00] the earth the world a better place to
[1:04:02] live in brother Bram says I say they're
[1:04:04] making it a better place to sin in and
[1:04:06] that's the truth sin it's becoming
[1:04:09] easier to sin it's becoming easier and I
[1:04:11] want to tell you young people amen you
[1:04:13] see the world doing the things that
[1:04:15] they're doing don't you uh fall in with
[1:04:17] that amen don't you fall in with that
[1:04:20] you say well it looks okay well I don't
[1:04:22] care amen you say well well uh uh the
[1:04:25] other young people people are are doing
[1:04:26] it and and and and they're getting by
[1:04:28] with it and it looks good it looks
[1:04:30] appealing amen but they could be
[1:04:31] unconverted amen and trying to tell you
[1:04:34] things that God is against you better
[1:04:36] listen now amen see because it's coming
[1:04:39] a time it's becoming more easier to sin
[1:04:42] it's becoming more relaxed Amen to where
[1:04:45] people ain't caring about what God
[1:04:46] thinks they're not caring about the ways
[1:04:48] of Holiness and the ways of of
[1:04:51] righteousness just because young people
[1:04:53] even in the message are them girls are
[1:04:55] allowing their skirts to get higher and
[1:04:57] higher that don't mean it's right can
[1:05:00] you say Amen it does not mean it's right
[1:05:03] amen and you'll be judged for it see
[1:05:05] amen you've got to stay with what the
[1:05:07] Bible says but it's becoming more easier
[1:05:09] to let down the bars it's and and and so
[1:05:12] so you understand they're defiling the
[1:05:15] very thing that God made this for uh uh
[1:05:19] uh for his his presence and his Spirit
[1:05:22] see amen and Sons and Daughters see amen
[1:05:25] but but peace taken away from the earth
[1:05:28] amen and now man has become hostile see
[1:05:32] and so now notice when Adam forfeited
[1:05:34] the title deed to the Earth and eternal
[1:05:37] life Satan could not get his well the
[1:05:40] prophet said his dirty hands his Filthy
[1:05:43] Hands on that title deed amen aren't you
[1:05:47] glad for that amen amen it went back to
[1:05:50] the to the the original owner amen that
[1:05:52] was God ain't that right see and and so
[1:05:56] uh uh we we find there in John in
[1:05:59] Revelations 5 tells us who has that
[1:06:01] title deed he says in the first verse
[1:06:04] and I saw in the right of him that sat
[1:06:06] on the throne a book written within and
[1:06:09] on the backside sealed with Seven Seals
[1:06:12] see so God is the one sitting on that
[1:06:15] throne and he has the title deed Satan
[1:06:18] has no right to that title deed
[1:06:21] therefore he has no right no claim over
[1:06:24] this Earth amen can you say Amen you
[1:06:27] think well look look like the
[1:06:28] Republicans are fighting over it and the
[1:06:30] Democrats are fighting for it and Russia
[1:06:33] is fighting for it and and China is
[1:06:35] fighting for it and us is fighting for
[1:06:37] it noain none of them have a right amen
[1:06:41] no sir the title deed to this earth goes
[1:06:44] to God Amen that's right can you say
[1:06:47] amen amen see and so uh uh therefore
[1:06:52] Satan cannot lay claim Amen to this
[1:06:55] earth and that's why he can't lay claim
[1:06:57] to you amen it's true now amen amen he
[1:07:01] can't lay claim see because it doesn't
[1:07:03] belong to him just like you don't belong
[1:07:05] to him ain't that right amen and if you
[1:07:08] really understood that you don't belong
[1:07:10] to him no wonder we look for a city Amen
[1:07:13] to come because we know the same God
[1:07:16] Amen that took us from Satan's grip is
[1:07:18] the same God that's going to take this
[1:07:20] Earth from Satan's grip Satan is just a
[1:07:24] squatter on God God's
[1:07:26] Property so we see in Revelations 5 that
[1:07:30] this this book the title deed Abstract
[1:07:32] title deed the prophet called it is in
[1:07:35] the hands of God waiting for Redemption
[1:07:38] claims that's what brother Brown said at
[1:07:41] the very opening of the seals it was in
[1:07:44] God's hands waiting for Redemption
[1:07:46] claims ain't that right but notice uh uh
[1:07:50] the second verse Revelations 5:2 and I
[1:07:54] saw a strong Ang proclaiming with a loud
[1:07:56] voice who is worthy to open the book and
[1:07:58] to loose the seals thereof no man
[1:08:01] everybody say no man no no man in heaven
[1:08:04] no man in earth no man neither under the
[1:08:07] Earth was able to open the book neither
[1:08:09] to look there on and I WP much because
[1:08:12] no man was found worthy to open and to
[1:08:15] read the book neither to look there on
[1:08:17] now now to think of that amen no one I
[1:08:20] mean he wept not because he was the one
[1:08:23] that he he couldn't open the book
[1:08:25] he wept because if no one was worthy
[1:08:28] then all creation was lost now you think
[1:08:31] of that here Abraham before the seals
[1:08:34] were ever opened before the blood of
[1:08:36] Christ was ever shed he was still
[1:08:38] looking for that City there was a
[1:08:40] revelation that struck his heart now
[1:08:43] here John is seeing the book Clos and
[1:08:45] there's no man now if there's no man
[1:08:48] that was able to open that book then
[1:08:50] everything that Abraham looked for
[1:08:52] everything that all of the Saints had
[1:08:55] had hope for they all died in vain they
[1:08:58] all lived in vain they everything was in
[1:09:00] vain and here was John because if no man
[1:09:02] could open that
[1:09:04] book amen uh uh then then if the book
[1:09:08] couldn't be open then all creation is
[1:09:09] lost right and and we know these things
[1:09:13] but just to go through it but God put
[1:09:15] God put a uh in place a law of
[1:09:18] redemption and this this law required an
[1:09:22] innocent substitute and it had to be a
[1:09:25] not only an innocent substitute but it
[1:09:27] had to be a kinsman redeemer can you say
[1:09:31] Amen therefore Adam couldn't not meet
[1:09:34] those
[1:09:35] requirements Adam he fell he went out
[1:09:37] after his wife but he could not bring
[1:09:39] her back he couldn't bring himself back
[1:09:42] because it made him a sinner ain't that
[1:09:44] right when he sined he become a sinner
[1:09:46] and he wasn't a sinner by just by his
[1:09:49] action you're not a sinner by your
[1:09:51] actions you're a sinner by Nature
[1:09:56] amen can you say amen that's right
[1:09:58] you're a sinner by Nature amen that's
[1:10:00] why when it comes to a sinner amen an
[1:10:03] unconverted man there's no black and
[1:10:05] white it's all black amen he can sit in
[1:10:08] church and and and and go through all
[1:10:10] the forms of religion but if he ain't
[1:10:12] converted he's still a sinner by Nature
[1:10:14] he's just as black as black can be amen
[1:10:18] that's right see and so uh uh uh the
[1:10:21] holy image of God left him and so
[1:10:24] mankind is just a fallen human being
[1:10:28] having a sinful nature now yes man can
[1:10:31] love and and and and we all have that
[1:10:34] part of love we love our children we
[1:10:36] love our wife we we well some love their
[1:10:39] boat and some love their house and some
[1:10:43] actually love school and some love their
[1:10:45] you know I mean it's we we have this
[1:10:47] expression of love in some way some love
[1:10:50] politics some love their their their
[1:10:52] denomination and some love this and love
[1:10:55] that but but see but but the highest
[1:10:57] form of love that man can ever obtain in
[1:11:01] his own self Fallen nature is human love
[1:11:04] that filio love can you say Amen now
[1:11:07] there's all kinds of loves under that
[1:11:09] there's lust love there's filthy love
[1:11:11] there brother brand called it loves
[1:11:12] loves loves loves it just condenscending
[1:11:14] down to just just just filth of Love
[1:11:19] ain't that right see amen man can have
[1:11:22] compassion but the highest form of
[1:11:24] compassion is human compassion you see
[1:11:27] he can know God but the only way he can
[1:11:29] know God uh in that Fallen state is by
[1:11:33] intellectual conception that's that's
[1:11:36] why you must be born
[1:11:38] again amen that's right see amen now he
[1:11:41] can still be as religious as can be as
[1:11:45] we SE it through the Bible amen Cain
[1:11:47] balum uh uh uh Judas and Esau and on and
[1:11:52] on we we could go here amen and they can
[1:11:56] be just as religious as can be and yet
[1:11:58] be a ranked sinner can you say Amen see
[1:12:01] it's impossible for man to ever surpass
[1:12:05] the human nature on his own Merit that's
[1:12:09] right and the human nature the prophet
[1:12:12] said takes man away from God it takes
[1:12:14] man away from the word of God it takes
[1:12:16] amen he could hear the word of God but
[1:12:18] all of a sudden intellectual thinking
[1:12:20] starts reasoning and and starts this and
[1:12:23] starts that oh yeah I can do this I can
[1:12:25] do that and I can do this and I can do
[1:12:27] that and yet not right in the will of
[1:12:29] God you can do God a service and not be
[1:12:31] his will can you say Amen see so so the
[1:12:35] human nature takes man away from God and
[1:12:38] God said to man uh I believe in Isaiah
[1:12:41] he said my ways are higher than your
[1:12:43] ways my thoughts are higher than your
[1:12:45] thoughts see so then man in the best of
[1:12:48] his ability in the best he has to offer
[1:12:51] he has a carnal mind he can he can do
[1:12:54] God a service with a carnal mind he he
[1:12:56] can he can he can he can read the Bible
[1:12:59] with a carnal mind he can even listen to
[1:13:01] The Prophet's messages with a carnal
[1:13:03] mind he he everything about it he's got
[1:13:06] a carnal mind but that carnal mind is
[1:13:09] enmity against God it Wars against God
[1:13:13] so how can you have peace when man is
[1:13:15] hostile toward God our own nature is
[1:13:18] hostile toward God ain't that right amen
[1:13:21] you see that that word uh enity uh uh uh
[1:13:25] is hostile hatred and enemy amen so the
[1:13:30] nature that man has is a is a carnal
[1:13:33] mind a carnal nature that's enity it's
[1:13:36] an enemy to God Amen God says we'll do
[1:13:39] this and we'll sit there and argue with
[1:13:40] him and we'll do this and well I'll do
[1:13:42] it my own way and I'm going to do it
[1:13:43] this way and and and and that's why
[1:13:45] people don't pray anymore that's why we
[1:13:48] don't seek God that's why you know the
[1:13:50] the politicians got their own ideas and
[1:13:53] and and here it's going that this nation
[1:13:55] is going to rotten and and it's going to
[1:13:57] whatever but they'll still refuse to
[1:13:59] pray amen here was a prophet that
[1:14:02] manifested the The Works of God and
[1:14:04] manifested the sign of Messiah and yet
[1:14:07] they would refuse because the Nature's
[1:14:10] hostile for God see so we find that the
[1:14:15] carnal mind has made man hostile an
[1:14:18] enemy towards God and all that God is it
[1:14:21] has put a hatred in man towards the word
[1:14:24] of God am amen and the will of God and
[1:14:28] I'm talking about perfect word perfect
[1:14:29] will not not uh uh our own
[1:14:32] interpretations of this but God's
[1:14:35] perfect will God's perfect way H we got
[1:14:39] our way well I can do it and I I'll read
[1:14:41] the Bible Well I think it needs to be
[1:14:43] this way and God would send us a prophet
[1:14:45] and tell us exactly I mean verbatim
[1:14:47] clear what we should do and what we
[1:14:49] shouldn't do oh but I think it ought to
[1:14:52] be this way see carnal mind ain't that
[1:14:55] right carnal mind see so now there's not
[1:14:58] a a a uh well Paul would tell us that
[1:15:01] the carnal mind is not subject to the
[1:15:03] law of God which is the word of God and
[1:15:05] neither can it be so then there there is
[1:15:08] not a sex born man that has that ability
[1:15:13] to redeem Mankind and all creation for
[1:15:16] the Bible says that all men everybody
[1:15:18] say all men that includes me have sinned
[1:15:23] and have come short the glory of God so
[1:15:26] this is why Jesus would tell us you must
[1:15:28] be born again amen that's right so so
[1:15:32] God's law uh of redemption required a
[1:15:35] kinsman redeemer but so that's why the
[1:15:38] Angels even though they're innocent of
[1:15:40] sin they could not redeem us ain't that
[1:15:44] right no animal could redeem nothing
[1:15:46] could redeem see but then John sees this
[1:15:49] bloody lamb step forward amen and take
[1:15:53] the book no is there he just takes the
[1:15:56] book loose the seals and John sees his
[1:16:01] name can you say Amen the Revelation
[1:16:04] starts strikes the heart amen that's
[1:16:07] right see well that lamb is Jesus for
[1:16:10] John there the Baptist John the Baptist
[1:16:13] identified him Behold the Lamb of God
[1:16:16] which taketh away the sins of the world
[1:16:19] ain't that right yeah he was a man but
[1:16:21] he wasn't sex born man he wasn't a just
[1:16:25] a common sex born he was born of a
[1:16:28] virgin you realize that people don't
[1:16:30] even know why he was born of a virgin
[1:16:32] why it had to be a virgin amen they
[1:16:35] don't even know it amen why well it's
[1:16:38] because our sex born uh uh being sex
[1:16:42] born caused us to be Sinners and if he
[1:16:45] was sex born he would have been a sinner
[1:16:48] amen but he had to be virgin born which
[1:16:51] no man could be that except God do it
[1:16:55] God created that blood cell God created
[1:16:59] that egg God created it all in the womb
[1:17:03] of a woman
[1:17:05] virgin ain't that right amen see now
[1:17:11] furthermore second Corinthians 5:19 Paul
[1:17:15] said it was God in Christ yeah
[1:17:17] reconciling the world for himself amen
[1:17:20] so we're no longer just seeing a man
[1:17:22] we're seeing a tabernacle of De
[1:17:25] that's
[1:17:27] right a human being kinsman redeemer but
[1:17:32] the only way he could be a kinsman
[1:17:33] redeemer was God would become man God
[1:17:37] would create his own body and with his
[1:17:40] own blood loose us from the grips of
[1:17:47] Satan praise the Lord Lord you see not
[1:17:50] only is God the God of Peace but he's
[1:17:53] also the author a peace prise the Lord
[1:17:57] he's the
[1:17:58] start the beginner amen ain't that right
[1:18:03] 1 Corinthians 14:33 for God is not the
[1:18:06] author of confusion but of Peace amen
[1:18:10] ain't that right so if you look back to
[1:18:14] Garden of Eden you will find that God's
[1:18:17] attitude is wrapped up in seven
[1:18:21] Redemptive names Hallelujah God showing
[1:18:24] himself
[1:18:25] through seven Redemptive names of
[1:18:28] Jehovah that's God's attitude when you
[1:18:31] look at the seven Redemptive names
[1:18:32] that's God's attitude toward people
[1:18:35] that's God's attitude toward the Earth
[1:18:37] that's God's attitude see and one of
[1:18:40] those names is Jehovah
[1:18:42] Shalom
[1:18:44] peace that's his attitude toward us he
[1:18:47] doesn't want to leave us in turmoil he
[1:18:49] doesn't want to leave us conflicted
[1:18:51] right he doesn't want to leave us as an
[1:18:53] enemy no he wants to be our
[1:18:56] friend and no one can do that except he
[1:18:59] he being the God of Peace amen amen and
[1:19:03] the attribute he's the author of Peace
[1:19:06] amen ain't that right so in speaking of
[1:19:10] Jesus uh Luke 1:76 and thou child shalt
[1:19:14] be called the prophet of the highest for
[1:19:16] Thou shalt go before the face of the
[1:19:17] Lord to prepare his ways to give
[1:19:20] knowledge of Salvation unto his people
[1:19:23] by the remission of their sins through
[1:19:26] the tender mercy of our God whereby the
[1:19:28] day spring from on high hath visited us
[1:19:32] to give light to them that sit in
[1:19:34] darkness and in the shadow of death to
[1:19:37] guide our feet in the way of Peace amen
[1:19:41] into the way of Peace ain't that right
[1:19:43] so then only through the work of
[1:19:46] redemption could peace come that's right
[1:19:49] ain't that right so he become the auth
[1:19:53] or the kinsman redeemer therefore the
[1:19:55] author of our peace now Isaiah 53:5 but
[1:20:00] he was wounded for our transgression he
[1:20:02] was bruised for our iniquity and the
[1:20:05] chastisement of our peace was upon him
[1:20:08] and with his stripes we are healed ain't
[1:20:10] that right brother Bram said we should
[1:20:11] have been the ones been chastised but
[1:20:14] now we have peace we should have been
[1:20:17] the one conflicted but we have peace we
[1:20:20] should be the one being judged but now
[1:20:23] we have peace he took our
[1:20:25] judgment he was the substitute he took
[1:20:29] our place he become me that I might
[1:20:32] become him can you say Amen yes sir see
[1:20:36] we have peace notice the peace he says
[1:20:39] John 14:27 Jesus said Peace I leave with
[1:20:42] you amen amen my peace I give unto you
[1:20:47] not as the world giveth give I unto you
[1:20:50] can you say Amen now the politicians
[1:20:52] promises is peace yeah the the the
[1:20:56] inventors of of these thing of the
[1:20:59] world promising us peace yes the church
[1:21:04] promises peace to us the pleasures of
[1:21:07] life promises peace no wonder people
[1:21:12] ain't looking to God no wonder the world
[1:21:14] ain't looking for the city of
[1:21:16] Peace amen they they they they're
[1:21:19] they're following a mirage that's
[1:21:22] true amen ain't that right
[1:21:25] cuz notice in in 1 Thessalonians 5:3
[1:21:28] Paul says when they shall say peace and
[1:21:31] safety oh my peace and safety sudden
[1:21:35] destruction cometh upon them as travail
[1:21:38] upon a woman with child and they shall
[1:21:40] not Escape can you say Amen look at this
[1:21:44] uh the Apostle Paul he's speaking of
[1:21:47] this day uh in that uh uh the 1
[1:21:51] Thessalonians 5:3 because look at the
[1:21:53] first and 2 ver verses there he says but
[1:21:56] of the times and the seasons Brethren
[1:21:58] you have no need that I write unto you
[1:22:00] for yourselves know perfectly that the
[1:22:03] day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in
[1:22:05] the night and when then when when they
[1:22:08] shall say peace and safety then sudden
[1:22:10] destruction cometh upon them now why why
[1:22:14] can't they have peace now notice now why
[1:22:16] can't they have peace why ain't they
[1:22:18] everything that they're doing to bring
[1:22:20] peace why ain't they getting it well
[1:22:23] Jeremiah 6 6 and 10 uh uh he says To
[1:22:27] Whom Shall I speak and give warning that
[1:22:29] they may hear behold their ear is
[1:22:33] uncircumcised see they ain't got the
[1:22:35] Holy Ghost to hear the spirit of Truth
[1:22:38] see the their ear is uncircumcised and
[1:22:41] they cannot hearken behold the word of
[1:22:44] the Lord is unto them a
[1:22:46] reproach see they have no Delight in it
[1:22:50] amen and that's the way people you you
[1:22:52] you you you get people and you start
[1:22:54] dealing with their liveses according to
[1:22:56] the word they they just get mad they

[1:23:31] houses shall be turned unto others with
[1:23:33] their fields and wives together for I
[1:23:36] will stretch out my hand upon the
[1:23:38] inhabitants of the land saith Lord for
[1:23:41] for from the least of them even unto the

[1:25:44] refused it in
[1:25:47] 1956 brother Ram said she'll either
[1:25:49] accept it or reject
[1:25:51] it this world has rejected it amen
[1:25:55] fulfilling the very scripture we will
[1:25:57] not walk therein also I set Watchmen
[1:26:00] over you I set preachers over you I I
[1:26:02] set ministers that'll preach the word
[1:26:05] saying hearken to the sound of the
[1:26:07] trumpet but they said we will not
[1:26:09] hearken
[1:26:11] Hello therefore he you Nations and know
[1:26:14] oh congregation what is among them here
[1:26:17] o Earth behold I will bring evil upon
[1:26:19] this people even the fruit of their
[1:26:21] thoughts because they have not hearkened
[1:26:23] unto my words nor to my law but rejected
[1:26:26] it see so so the world is fulfilling
[1:26:29] these scriptures now and yet they're
[1:26:32] crying for
[1:26:34] peace peace peace ain't that right but
[1:26:39] as they cry for peace they are
[1:26:40] committing abominable things sins they
[1:26:44] have become as the sodomites Amen in
[1:26:47] lot's day and and as the people in
[1:26:50] Noah's day ain't that right but this day
[1:26:53] is even worse in that day because both
[1:26:55] of them days are combined into this
[1:26:58] day sure is that's right and did you
[1:27:02] notice in lot day them the actions of
[1:27:04] them people brought the wrath of God
[1:27:06] upon that sure did and the actions of
[1:27:09] the people in Noah's day brought the
[1:27:12] wrath of God upon
[1:27:15] them yes sir see this is the worst day
[1:27:19] ever do you believe that amen every vile
[1:27:23] spirit every demon spirit is loosed upon
[1:27:27] this day and people are manifesting
[1:27:30] them that is true and you say Amen out
[1:27:34] of all the ages here we are amen the lid
[1:27:37] of hell has come off demons are pouring
[1:27:41] out everywhere it's upon the
[1:27:43] people it's the worst day and and you
[1:27:46] can't expect nothing but the wrath of
[1:27:48] God that's right amen that's right it's
[1:27:52] true see so they cannot bring peace no
[1:27:55] no matter what their inventions are you
[1:27:58] you you you say well you know I I just
[1:28:00] you know uh um you know people people
[1:28:03] get in so into movies these days just to
[1:28:06] just to relax their mind and just for
[1:28:08] the entertainment but there's no peace
[1:28:10] in that you you understand what I'm
[1:28:13] saying I I hope I'm really making it
[1:28:15] clear the best I can is that there's no
[1:28:18] peace on this Earth there can be no
[1:28:22] peace on this Earth
[1:28:24] without
[1:28:26] Redemption amen now if you look uh
[1:28:29] Romans 3:11 see he says there is none
[1:28:33] that understandeth there is none that
[1:28:35] that seeketh after God they're all gone
[1:28:37] out of the way they are together become
[1:28:39] unprofitable there is none that doeth
[1:28:41] good no not one their throat is an open
[1:28:44] seure their with their tongues they have
[1:28:46] used deceit the poison of asps is under
[1:28:50] their lips their whose mouth is full of
[1:28:52] cursing and bitterness their feet are
[1:28:55] Swift to shed blood destruction and
[1:28:57] misery are in their ways and the way of
[1:29:00] peace they have not known there is no
[1:29:03] fear of God Before Their Eyes ain't that
[1:29:05] right so then that would tell us that as
[1:29:08] long as there is sin there is going to
[1:29:10] be no peace amen as long as there's sin
[1:29:14] there will be no peace ain't that right
[1:29:16] see and and as we said the law and and
[1:29:19] of sin and death Works in every human
[1:29:21] being uh uh and and and that true and
[1:29:24] therefore Satan is able to control
[1:29:27] Humanity it doesn't matter if they're
[1:29:29] doctors of divinity it doesn't matter if
[1:29:31] he's the pope himself it doesn't matter
[1:29:33] if it's in the white house if they're
[1:29:35] rich if they're poor amen Satan is able
[1:29:38] to control because man is under the law
[1:29:42] of sin and death politics religion
[1:29:44] education science all these things ain't
[1:29:46] that right Satan is the inspiration
[1:29:49] behind
[1:29:50] science he's the inspiration behind
[1:29:53] education he's the inspiration behind
[1:29:55] these nations politics he's the one
[1:29:58] that's anointing the Democrats he's the
[1:30:00] one that's anointing the Republicans
[1:30:02] he's the one there there is no uh uh uh
[1:30:06] uh uh sides with him he's anointing them
[1:30:09] both politics is all
[1:30:12] corrupt he's behind
[1:30:15] technology yeah hello amen amen he's
[1:30:20] behind
[1:30:21] Hollywood he's behind religion
[1:30:24] he's the one that causes Wars among the
[1:30:26] Nations he's the one who breaks up
[1:30:28] marriages and families he's the one who
[1:30:31] causes the murders and adulteries and
[1:30:33] POS uh prostitutions he's the one that
[1:30:36] controls the politics we all know that
[1:30:39] politics is a political power and it's
[1:30:41] his power that's what brother ramam said
[1:30:45] can you say Amen he's the one that's
[1:30:47] inspiring amen these politicians to
[1:30:49] sanction uh uh abortion sanction
[1:30:52] homosexuality sanction transgenders yes
[1:30:55] he's the one that's causing these
[1:30:56] ministers in schools of of uh theology
[1:31:00] to to accept these things and and the
[1:31:03] prophet said in all of his corruption
[1:31:05] Satan is making ladies and men of all
[1:31:08] ages young and old drunk cursing
[1:31:11] swearing committing adultery wrapped up
[1:31:14] in the Fashions of the world why because
[1:31:17] it's Satan's domain yes sir they're
[1:31:19] under Satan's Dominion can you say Amen
[1:31:22] why do we have wars why do we have
[1:31:24] troubles why why why why why do we have
[1:31:27] Nation against Nation brother BR said
[1:31:29] because Jesus the prince of Life come
[1:31:32] and they killed
[1:31:34] him can you say amen amen that's right
[1:31:37] see so it's impossible to have peace as
[1:31:40] long as the God of Peace is
[1:31:43] rejected ain't that right so is World
[1:31:46] Peace going to come by politics
[1:31:48] absolutely not is the world going to uh
[1:31:51] is is World Peace going to uh uh uh uh
[1:31:54] come by by religion absolutely not is
[1:31:58] World Peace going to come by the union
[1:32:00] of Nations and the union of churches
[1:32:02] absolutely not that's what they're
[1:32:04] joining they join the the the the union
[1:32:08] of Nations the United Nations to bring
[1:32:11] World Peace it ain't working is it it
[1:32:14] ain't working well they're joining now
[1:32:16] the the union of churches together to
[1:32:19] bring a peace now watch her she's rising
[1:32:22] up you're going to take
[1:32:24] that's right brother Ram say she she
[1:32:26] going to do it they're they're joining
[1:32:28] together to fight
[1:32:29] communism and all these things it's it's
[1:32:32] it's it's happening right this
[1:32:34] election's just really becoming
[1:32:37] interesting it's in God's hands there's
[1:32:39] nothing out of control I can't tell you
[1:32:42] if Trump Biden or who's going to do it
[1:32:43] but whoever's in there it's it's it's
[1:32:45] only making way for something to happen
[1:32:49] can you say amen and it's all for the
[1:32:51] sake of Peace but there will be no
[1:32:54] peace can you say Amen cuz that kind of
[1:32:58] Union has always failed and brother Bram
[1:33:00] said it'll fail again see so there will
[1:33:02] only be peace on the earth When sin is
[1:33:05] gotten rid of can you say amen amen see
[1:33:09] sin ceases when Satan is bound how many
[1:33:13] believes that sin ceases when Satan is
[1:33:16] bound and it is destroyed when Satan is
[1:33:22] destroyed amen think of it during the
[1:33:25] Millennium the Bible says Satan's going
[1:33:28] to be bound ain't that right look uh
[1:33:32] Revelations 20 and 1 and I saw an angel
[1:33:35] come down from heaven having the key of
[1:33:37] the bottomless pit and a great chain in
[1:33:39] his hand and he laid hold on the dragon
[1:33:42] that old serpent which is the devil and
[1:33:44] Satan and bound him a thousand years
[1:33:48] amen and cast him into a bottomless pit
[1:33:51] shut him up see and set a seal upon him
[1:33:55] that he should deceive the Nations no
[1:33:57] more till the Thousand Years should be
[1:34:00] fulfilled right so what does that tell
[1:34:02] you and I that the Millennium is going
[1:34:05] to be a time of
[1:34:08] Peace ain't that right amen this happens
[1:34:11] after the marriage supper of the Lamb
[1:34:13] remember we're raptured out of here
[1:34:15] which is imminent at any time we're
[1:34:18] going to go in to the marriage supper of
[1:34:21] the Lamb amen the tribulation is going
[1:34:23] to set here upon this Earth for 3 and
[1:34:25] 1/2 years but then there is Promised a
[1:34:30] honeymoon Hallelujah for the bridegroom
[1:34:33] and the bride amen ain't that right and
[1:34:36] it's going to be a a a a a a time a
[1:34:40] peace and the city that we're looking
[1:34:42] for comes after the honeymoon amen ain't
[1:34:45] that right see and then the prophet says
[1:34:47] the bridegroom and and takes his bride
[1:34:51] home Glory see so but the the Millennium
[1:34:55] is going to be one Great Piece now now
[1:34:58] notice uh uh uh Revelations 20 and4 and
[1:35:02] I saw Thrones and they set upon them and
[1:35:06] judgment was given unto them and I saw
[1:35:07] the souls of them that were beheaded for
[1:35:09] the witness of Jesus and for the word of
[1:35:11] God which had not worshiped the Beast
[1:35:13] neither his image neither had received
[1:35:15] his Mark upon their foreheads or in
[1:35:17] their hands and they lived and reigned
[1:35:20] with Christ a thousand years but the
[1:35:22] rest of the Dead live not again until
[1:35:25] the thousand years were finished this is
[1:35:29] the first
[1:35:31] resurrection blessed and holy is he that
[1:35:34] have part in the First Resurrection on
[1:35:37] such the second death ha no power but
[1:35:41] they shall be Priests of God and of
[1:35:44] Christ and shall reign everybody say
[1:35:49] rain they shall reign with him a th000
[1:35:54] years now that's got to tell us
[1:35:56] something that Redemption has taken
[1:35:59] place amen ain't that right we're going
[1:36:02] to rain brother Brown called it the
[1:36:04] millennial rain see Malachi 4:3 and you
[1:36:08] shall tread down the wicked for they
[1:36:11] shall be ashes Under The Souls of your
[1:36:14] feet what the tribulation is already
[1:36:16] done with ain't that right they shall be
[1:36:19] ashes Under The Souls of your feet in
[1:36:21] the day that I shall do this sayith the
[1:36:24] Lord of host now notice the prophet says
[1:36:27] see at the return of the church and
[1:36:29] bride see the Bride In Christ shall walk
[1:36:32] out upon their ashes in the Millennium
[1:36:35] when the earth is purified by fire and
[1:36:37] there they shall
[1:36:40] rain aren't you glad for that it's going
[1:36:43] to be a reign of
[1:36:45] Peace amen ain't that right notice and
[1:36:48] the heathens that's never heard the
[1:36:51] gospel shall be raised in that time and
[1:36:55] the sons of God will be manifested if
[1:36:58] he's to rain he's got to have something
[1:37:00] to rain over he's got a domain and they
[1:37:03] ruled and reign with Christ and Christ
[1:37:06] ruled with a rod of iron the Nations
[1:37:09] then the gospel he says see then the
[1:37:11] Manifest manifested sons of God with the
[1:37:14] authority just like he had when he was
[1:37:16] here there will come the Millennium in
[1:37:19] that rain upon the ashes can you say
[1:37:22] amen amen
[1:37:24] but we're looking for a city
[1:37:27] amen the Millennium is not the new
[1:37:30] heaven it's not the new
[1:37:33] Earth brother Brown said see the
[1:37:35] Millennium is just a different Reign
[1:37:38] it's a time of
[1:37:40] rest ain't that right you're still in
[1:37:43] time because you're here for a thousand
[1:37:45] years see in that Millennium you're
[1:37:48] still in time but it's a time of rest
[1:37:51] see brother Brown said the millennium is
[1:37:53] is just a rest place a rest period not
[1:37:56] at all the new heavens and the new Earth
[1:37:59] for you see in the Millennium we have
[1:38:01] things that would not go into that see
[1:38:04] it's a type of the old seventh day out
[1:38:07] at Eden seventh day after he made the
[1:38:09] world seventh day God rested in Eden and
[1:38:12] now the Millennium ain't that right see
[1:38:16] so so we look the first six days God
[1:38:19] created the world but on the seventh day
[1:38:20] he rested ain't that right so so second
[1:38:24] Peter 3 and8 one day is with the Lord as
[1:38:27] a thousand years and A Thousand Years is
[1:38:29] as a day unto the Lord so we can say in
[1:38:32] six days he created or in 6,000 years
[1:38:36] God created and on that seventh he
[1:38:39] rested
[1:38:41] amen amen now the world has gone through
[1:38:45] 6,000 years ain't that right right time
[1:38:50] the time of 6,000 years and now we're
[1:38:54] getting ready to enter into that seventh
[1:38:57] day
[1:38:59] amen hello for the world ain't that
[1:39:02] right now brother Brandon talks and
[1:39:06] tells us how that the number six is the
[1:39:09] number of
[1:39:10] man so 6,000 years is man's day yes
[1:39:15] brother BR said see it's man's doing
[1:39:17] man's work man's religion man's Church
[1:39:22] man's ideas man's achievements
[1:39:25] everything about
[1:39:26] man ain't that right
[1:39:29] amen yes sir that's that's man's day but
[1:39:33] we we're finishing up that's right thank
[1:39:37] the Lord now the day of the
[1:39:39] Lord hello is coming the Lord remember
[1:39:44] John was caught up on the the Lord's day
[1:39:47] brother Braham said see John was over in
[1:39:49] the Lord's day and what did what what
[1:39:51] did John see nothing about man in his
[1:39:55] accomplishments he saw Christ as being
[1:39:59] Supreme judge he saw the Nations come to
[1:40:02] their end he saw the mighty Angel
[1:40:05] descend to Earth with an open book to
[1:40:06] claim what he had redeemed praise the
[1:40:08] Lord see he heard the mighty Angel
[1:40:10] declare that time shall be no more he
[1:40:13] saw the bride in the Millennium he saw
[1:40:16] the holy city coming down upon a new
[1:40:19] Earth yeah new Heaven and a new Earth
[1:40:23] hello Amen in the Lord's Day Lord can
[1:40:27] you say amen amen see it was a
[1:40:30] revelation that had been shut up in
[1:40:33] God's mind and John sees this didn't
[1:40:38] understand
[1:40:39] everything but he sees it can you say
[1:40:42] Amen now if you notice there will still
[1:40:45] be sin after the
[1:40:46] Millennium for the Bible says that Satan
[1:40:49] will be loose for a little season
[1:40:51] Revelations 20 and 7 s and when the
[1:40:54] thousand years are expired Satan shall
[1:40:57] be loosed out of his prison knows what
[1:40:59] he does he'll never be
[1:41:02] converted no matter what you do he'll
[1:41:04] never be
[1:41:05] converted and his demons will never be
[1:41:07] converted right his subjects will never
[1:41:10] be converted
[1:41:13] hello and he shall be loosed out of his
[1:41:16] prison and shall go out to deceive the
[1:41:18] Nations which are in the four quarters
[1:41:20] of the earth Gog and Magog together them
[1:41:23] together to battle uh the number of whom
[1:41:26] is as the sand of the sea ain't that
[1:41:28] right so then Satan is not destroyed
[1:41:32] during the Millennium he's only bound
[1:41:35] amen ain't that right and what what
[1:41:38] binds him the the Bible talks about that
[1:41:41] chain the angel with the chain that
[1:41:43] bound him brother Bram said it's it's
[1:41:45] it's a chain not a log chain but it's a
[1:41:48] chain of circumstance amen ain't that
[1:41:50] right see brother Brown said see he
[1:41:53] cannot come out and deceive the Nations
[1:41:55] no more all of his subjects was in hell
[1:41:59] and all that was resurrected on the
[1:42:01] Earth was redeemed and Jesus with them
[1:42:05] can you say Amen so he had nothing to
[1:42:08] work
[1:42:09] on he can't work on
[1:42:13] you you resisted the devil's lie in the
[1:42:17] beginning you proved on this Earth that
[1:42:20] you're not like Eve amen
[1:42:25] you're going through your testings and
[1:42:27] you're going through your
[1:42:29] trials am to prove to Satan that you're
[1:42:32] not like
[1:42:33] her hello amen he'll work on all kinds
[1:42:38] of people in this day doesn't matter who
[1:42:40] they are famous nonf famous poor Rich
[1:42:44] whoever he works on them but there's
[1:42:46] going to come a time that there will be
[1:42:48] nothing to work on because it'll only be
[1:42:50] the redeemed
[1:42:53] praise the Lord and he has nothing to
[1:42:55] work on brother Bri said at the end of
[1:42:57] the Millennium of of the Thousand Years
[1:43:00] comes the second Resurrection when
[1:43:03] they're all raised up and Satan is loose
[1:43:05] for a little season so the Millennium he
[1:43:08] says in another place is the Sabbath day
[1:43:11] when the church will no more labor
[1:43:14] against sin aren't you glad for that
[1:43:17] church am I hope this is all right for
[1:43:21] you this morning but am to think there's
[1:43:24] coming a time right we ain't going to
[1:43:27] labor against that Temptation amen we're
[1:43:29] not going to labor against them habits
[1:43:32] we're not going to labor against the the
[1:43:35] Waring that that that comes of with
[1:43:38] today see it's a time of rest Satan is
[1:43:42] Bound for a little season a thousand
[1:43:44] years because his subjects is is all in
[1:43:46] Hell the church that's on the earth is
[1:43:48] redeemed right in the presence of Christ
[1:43:51] so he has nothing can work on so it's
[1:43:54] not a chain a log chain it's a chain of
[1:43:58] circumstance he has nothing he can
[1:44:01] do
[1:44:03] amen he's helpless hopeless just waiting
[1:44:08] for the resurrection of his
[1:44:11] subjects then they're separated a sheep
[1:44:14] and goats from the goats can you say
[1:44:16] Amen so then sin will be carried on the
[1:44:20] other side and I get ready to close but
[1:44:22] sin will be carried over on the other
[1:44:25] side of the Millennium brother Bram
[1:44:27] typed it with Noah going into the ark
[1:44:30] and and ham in the ark and they were
[1:44:33] carried over see uh and and he he typed
[1:44:37] it as the type of Millenium see Enoch
[1:44:40] was translated Before the Flood ain't
[1:44:43] that right which was a type of the Bride
[1:44:45] being caught up raptured not the one
[1:44:48] that was carried over amen ain't that
[1:44:50] right so it's after the Millennium that
[1:44:55] sin is going to be dealt
[1:44:58] with
[1:45:01] destroyed
[1:45:03] hello it's showing the process of the
[1:45:05] city to come that's right
[1:45:08] amen sin has to be dealt
[1:45:12] with ain't that right
[1:45:15] amen then the prophet said there comes a
[1:45:20] renovation yes sir of Heaven and Earth
[1:45:23] amen ain't that right Isaiah 65:16 for
[1:45:27] behold I create new heavens and a new
[1:45:30] Earth and the former shall not be
[1:45:32] remembered nor come into mind amen
[1:45:37] Revelations 21:1 and I saw a new Heaven
[1:45:39] and a new Earth for the first Heaven and

[1:47:12] verse there and I John saw the holy city
[1:47:14] New Jerusalem coming down from God out
[1:47:16] of Heaven prepared as a bride adorned
[1:47:19] for her husband and I heard a great
[1:47:20] voice out of Heaven saying behold the
[1:47:22] tabern Le of God is with men and he will
[1:47:24] dwell with them and they shall be his
[1:47:26] people and God himself shall be with
[1:47:28] them and be their God and notice at this
[1:47:31] time and God shall wipe the tears from
[1:47:33] their eyes am amen yeah oh wipe away all
[1:47:38] tears from their eyes and there shall be
[1:47:40] no more death neither sorrow nor crying
[1:47:43] neither shall there be any more pain for
[1:47:45] the former things are passed away see he
[1:47:48] says there God will be with his true
[1:47:51] attributes son and daughters where he
[1:47:53] can fellowship with them in Holiness
[1:47:57] with their eyes blinded to any sin for
[1:48:00] there will never be no more Sin from
[1:48:03] there
[1:48:04] on aren't you glad for that yes sir see
[1:48:08] so that Holy City cannot come down until
[1:48:11] the Earth has been totally redeemed
[1:48:15] hallelujah amen and when it's redeemed
[1:48:17] then sin and the effects of it is
[1:48:20] totally annihilated right now
[1:48:24] church I I hope I hope you understand
[1:48:27] through my you know my chopped up ways
[1:48:29] of trying to tell you preach this
[1:48:32] morning but think of what Redemption
[1:48:34] means to your soul yeah right sin has
[1:48:38] been totally obliviated amen amen
[1:48:42] because you're not waiting for the
[1:48:43] Redemption of your soul your soul has
[1:48:46] been redeemed
[1:48:48] now then you can no longer be a sinner
[1:48:52] in his sight
[1:48:55] Lord can you say amen amen that's right
[1:48:57] brother Bram talks about you know what
[1:48:59] where Jesus said heavens and earth will
[1:49:00] pass away the heavens and earth passing
[1:49:03] away see the Bible speaks of that
[1:49:05] doesn't mean that it'll be annihilated
[1:49:07] but rather that it will pass from one
[1:49:09] form to another amen ain't that right
[1:49:12] see pass from one thing to another from
[1:49:14] one condition to another it's going to
[1:49:17] be changed that's what Redemption is all
[1:49:21] about Lord man can't even comprehend no
[1:49:24] wonder Paul would tell us you know eye
[1:49:26] ha Not Seen Nor Ear heard neither has it
[1:49:28] entered into the heart of man the things
[1:49:31] that God has prepared for them ain't
[1:49:33] that right why because it comes through
[1:49:38] Redemption amen comes through Redemption
[1:49:42] going to be changed see that's what
[1:49:44] Redemption does we we all know it
[1:49:46] brother Bram talks about it of how that
[1:49:48] it's going to be loosed loosed when he
[1:49:51] Jesus sitting there at at at standing
[1:49:54] there at Lazarus and he calls Lazarus to
[1:49:56] come forth and then he says loose him
[1:49:59] and let him go he said that's the same
[1:50:01] thing that happens to this
[1:50:05] earth it's loose from Satan's grip amen
[1:50:10] it's the same thing that happened to
[1:50:11] your
[1:50:12] soul when that Holy Spirit baptism fire
[1:50:16] of God come into you it loosed you from
[1:50:20] Satan's grip that's right right
[1:50:23] think of that a people on this Earth
[1:50:26] demons pouring out everywhere and he
[1:50:29] can't touch
[1:50:31] you praise the Lord praise the Lord
[1:50:34] because you've been loosed and the
[1:50:35] prophet said you've been perfectly
[1:50:37] loosed if it if you're loosed by a
[1:50:40] perfect blood which is the blood of God
[1:50:42] then it's a perfect loosening per it's
[1:50:44] not saved today and lost
[1:50:46] tomorrow no sir it's not saved when you
[1:50:50] feel good and lost when you feel like
[1:50:51] you're you're nothing no no no no you're
[1:50:55] sealed to the day of your
[1:50:57] Redemption sealed sealed sealed brother
[1:51:00] BR says what does that mean you're
[1:51:02] sealed in and Satan is sealed out he
[1:51:06] can't touch
[1:51:08] you I love it amen

[1:51:15] same man in stature that you was when
[1:51:18] God called you same woman but you see
[1:51:21] what it did it was a generation the old
[1:51:23] life passed away the old desire has
[1:51:26] passed away when you used to like to
[1:51:28] drink cuss fuss stew and run around and
[1:51:31] immoral things all that just died then
[1:51:36] you were Satan's instrument now you're
[1:51:40] redeemed yes can you say amen he said
[1:51:43] and that's what the world will be the
[1:51:45] same way redeemed a new Heaven and a new
