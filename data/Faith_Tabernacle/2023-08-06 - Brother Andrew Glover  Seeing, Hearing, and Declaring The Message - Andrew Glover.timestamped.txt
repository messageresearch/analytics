[43:10] it's because of the blood of Jesus
[43:12] Christ
[43:13] amen after that blood was shed then we
[43:16] received the command come boldly before
[43:19] the throne of grace
[43:21] don't come timid don't come doubting
[43:23] don't come worrying you come boldly why
[43:28] there's an atonement that blood speaking
[43:31] on our behalf
[43:32] every day that blood is there atoning
[43:35] for us you say well I've made mistakes
[43:38] don't matter the blood is there speaking
[43:40] on your behalf come boldly it doesn't
[43:42] change the command of God
[43:45] no matter how much a man has fallen a
[43:48] man he still comes to that throne of
[43:50] grace boldly
[43:52] because he knows there's a blood there
[43:54] atoning
[43:55] amen and I'm so glad for that and no
[43:58] matter how much this you know impossible
[44:01] the situation looks you never let your
[44:04] situation intimidate you
[44:06] you come boldly before the throne of
[44:08] grace because the blood is so much
[44:10] greater than your problems it's it's so
[44:13] much greater than your weakness it's so
[44:15] much greater than anything
[44:18] Amen in the blood of Jesus Christ and
[44:21] I'm so glad for that it's a perfect
[44:23] blood
[44:24] because it come from a perfect sacrifice
[44:27] God himself become man so he could bleed
[44:30] for you
[44:31] I think that's powerful God himself
[44:34] become flesh and blood
[44:36] bones so he could take his own blood and
[44:40] produce an atonement what other
[44:42] atonement do we need there is no other
[44:45] atonement that could make it happen
[44:47] but then the prophet would tell us a
[44:49] perfect blood brought forth a perfect
[44:51] loosening
[44:53] amen Amy's loosed
[44:56] it's a perfect loosening
[44:58] if he and and you know if he loosed you
[45:01] one day
[45:02] then you can never be bound the next
[45:04] it's a perfect loosening you say but I
[45:08] have gone through so much trouble since
[45:09] I gave my heart to the Lord that doesn't
[45:11] matter it's a perfect loosening
[45:14] yes in this life you're always going to
[45:16] go through your battles amen but there's
[45:18] an atonement and I'm so glad for that
[45:20] you love the Lord
[45:22] in the wonderful just to be a Christian

[55:11] believe you can still change
[55:12] circumstances so this morning dear God
[55:14] as we've sung the songs of Zion Lord
[55:17] your Prophet said that the singing went
[55:19] before the word he said then when the

[55:25] that that that's where the enemy battles
[55:27] us Lord is when it comes to this word
[55:29] but Lord we know you've never been

[55:38] you will get the victory out of this
[55:39] service but Lord you've already gotten
[55:41] it Lord and I know that you're going to

[56:22] Savior Jesus Christ we pray
[56:24] and all the believer says amen and amen
[56:28] just before we read this morning I do
[56:30] want to say happy anniversary to my wife
[56:32] on yesterday uh I sure sure love her and
[56:35] appreciate her and I think I thank God
[56:38] for a holy ghost wife amen that amen she
[56:41] told somebody I said actually we got
[56:42] married we went on our honeymoon come
[56:44] home for one day and hit the road and I
[56:47] think the first place we come after we
[56:48] got married was here and preached and
[56:50] she's just been a faithful support and
[56:52] help to us and we sure sure love and
[56:54] appreciate her this morning amen The
[56:56] Book of Job the 42nd chapter
[56:59] in the first verse
[57:01] the Bible says then job answered the
[57:04] Lord and said I know that thou cast do
[57:07] everything how many believes that
[57:09] and that no fault can be withholding
[57:12] from thee who is he that hideth counsel
[57:15] without knowledge therefore have I
[57:17] uttered that I understood not things too
[57:21] wonderful for me which I knew not here I
[57:24] beseech thee and I will speak and I will
[57:27] demand Of Thee I watch these words
[57:30] declare thou unto me so job is actually
[57:33] wanting God he's demanding God declare
[57:37] yourself to me in the fifth verse he
[57:39] says I have heard of thee by the hearing
[57:42] of the year but now mine I see a thee
[57:46] amen declare thou unto me I've heard of
[57:49] thee by the hearing of the year but now
[57:51] might I see a thee he says wherefore I
[57:54] abhor myself and repent in dust and
[57:57] Ashes now in the book of First John the
[58:00] first chapter
[58:01] I want to look at the first verse of
[58:04] First John
[58:05] 1. I know it's a very familiar reading
[58:08] to you in first John 1
[58:11] and verse 1 the Bible says here John is
[58:14] describing the person of Christ and he
[58:16] says that which was from the beginning
[58:18] which we have heard which we have seen
[58:21] with our eyes which we have looked upon
[58:24] and our hands have handled of the word
[58:26] of life for the life was manifested so
[58:29] this is not any kind of life this is
[58:31] absolute life for the life was
[58:34] manifested and we have seen it and bear
[58:36] witness and show unto you that eternal
[58:39] life which was with the father and was
[58:42] manifested unto us now look here in the
[58:44] third verse that which we have seen and
[58:47] heard declare we unto you that ye Also
[58:51] may have fellowship with us and truly
[58:54] our fellowship is with the father and
[58:56] with his son Jesus Christ and these
[58:59] things right we unto you
[59:01] that your joy may be full I love verse 5
[59:05] this then is the message which we have
[59:09] heard of him here's that word again and
[59:11] declare unto you that God is light and
[59:15] in him is no Darkness at all amen we ask
[59:19] Lord this one and to add the blessing to
[59:21] the reading of his word as you can have
[59:23] your seats here this morning amen how
[59:25] many can say thank you Lord for the
[59:27] reading of the word of God Amen I want
[59:30] you here by the help of the Lord for
[59:31] just a few moments I want to speak to
[59:33] here and if I will title this this
[59:34] morning I want to speak to you on a
[59:36] hearing seeing and declaring the message
[59:39] hearing seeing and declaring the message
[59:42] you know first John 1 5 he uses the word
[59:46] there message which we believe that we
[59:48] are followers of the end time message
[59:50] amen we're not ashamed of it that's who
[59:52] we are that's what we believe it's what
[59:54] we preach it's what we study amen we are
[59:57] uh Vindicated Believers of this end time
[1:00:00] word now when John uses this word word
[1:00:02] message the Greek definition is an
[1:00:04] announcement it is a promise it is the
[1:00:07] act of promising it is a promise given
[1:00:09] or to be given amen it's a promise good
[1:00:12] or a blessing so when John says this
[1:00:15] then is the message he's actually saying
[1:00:17] this then is the promise this then is
[1:00:20] the announcement this in this the the
[1:00:22] blessing that God is going to give to
[1:00:25] you amen and what he's showing you here
[1:00:27] amen is you've got to hear it you've got
[1:00:30] to see it but then you've got to declare
[1:00:31] it now brother Brandon preaches hearing
[1:00:33] recognizing and acting on the word of
[1:00:36] God and he said now first Faith cometh
[1:00:38] by hearing and hearing of the word of
[1:00:40] God he said then the believer hears it
[1:00:43] and recognizes it and then acts on it he
[1:00:46] said the carnal man will hear it the
[1:00:48] sound of it but never so the carnal man
[1:00:50] will hear it they will hear the sound of
[1:00:52] it but they will never act upon it
[1:00:54] because here means to understand it
[1:00:57] right now look at it it's looking at
[1:00:59] something but you see it is to
[1:01:01] understand it so so when you're looking
[1:01:02] at it you're actually looking at it
[1:01:04] physically but when you see it you
[1:01:07] actually understand it and Jesus said
[1:01:09] except a man be born again he cannot see
[1:01:11] the kingdom of God in other words he
[1:01:14] cannot understand the kingdom of God now
[1:01:15] amen I believe that we have seen the
[1:01:18] message how many will agree we've we've
[1:01:20] seen the message we've looked at it
[1:01:22] we've read it amen our physical natural
[1:01:24] eyes have seen it we've seen the
[1:01:26] pictures amen some of you all have been
[1:01:28] to the places where things happen you've
[1:01:29] been to the to Sabino Canyon to say
[1:01:32] you've been to all these places so
[1:01:33] you've seen him amen if you haven't been
[1:01:35] there to see it you've been in the
[1:01:37] church and you've heard it we've all
[1:01:38] seen the message we've all heard the
[1:01:40] message but I believe Amen brother Terry
[1:01:43] that the time has come to declare the
[1:01:45] message I I believe the time has come
[1:01:47] amen not just to say we've seen it not
[1:01:49] just to say we've heard it amen but the
[1:01:51] time has come to declare it I love what
[1:01:53] Isaiah 48 verse 6 says thou has heard
[1:01:56] amen see all things and will not ye
[1:01:59] declared thouest heard you have seen all
[1:02:02] these things but will you not declare it
[1:02:03] he said I have showed thee new things
[1:02:05] from this time even hidden things amen
[1:02:08] and thou didst not know them in Acts 20
[1:02:11] verse 27 I love what Paul says he says I
[1:02:14] have not shunned to declare unto you the
[1:02:17] all the counsel of God Amen I have not
[1:02:19] shunned to declare unto you all the
[1:02:22] counsel of God now look at this word
[1:02:24] shunned it means to draw back it means
[1:02:26] to let down it means to lower to
[1:02:28] withdraw he meant of a timid person to
[1:02:31] withdraw oneself Amen to hesitate amen
[1:02:34] of those who from Timothy hesitate to
[1:02:37] avow what they believe amen so you can
[1:02:40] actually see something you can hear it
[1:02:42] amen but if there's a spirit of
[1:02:44] timidness if there's a spirit amen of
[1:02:46] shyness upon you then you will actually
[1:02:48] draw back amen when that's actually the
[1:02:51] time to declare what you believe they've
[1:02:53] been seek to be unwilling to utter from
[1:02:55] Fear now how many knows that fear is not
[1:02:57] of God Amen it comes from the Devil the
[1:03:00] Bible says amen he is not given us the
[1:03:02] spirit of fear but of power and of love
[1:03:05] and of a sound mind the book of Romans
[1:03:07] he said the spirit of fear again no amen
[1:03:09] but the spirit of adoption whereby we
[1:03:12] cry by father so God Amen has not given
[1:03:15] us the spirit of fear amen that he's
[1:03:17] given us the spirit of anointing and the
[1:03:19] spirit of Revelation Amen to declare the
[1:03:22] things that we have seen and the things
[1:03:24] that we've heard I love what the prophet
[1:03:25] says here and looking unto Jesus he said
[1:03:28] now in the name of Jesus Christ I take
[1:03:31] every spirit in here amen under my
[1:03:34] control to declare the word of God Amen
[1:03:37] I take every spirit in the building
[1:03:38] under my control Amen to declare the
[1:03:42] word of God now he had seen the word he
[1:03:44] had heard the word but now the time had
[1:03:46] come to declare the word amen and there
[1:03:49] were spirits of opposition there was
[1:03:50] Demons of resistance there were Demons
[1:03:53] of doubt and demons of unbelief that was
[1:03:55] pushing against him amen but rather than
[1:03:58] drawing back and withdrawing himself he
[1:04:00] stood there today declare the word of
[1:04:02] God I say thank God Amen for a prophet
[1:04:05] who is not afraid to stand the hair in
[1:04:07] the face of whatever the case was and
[1:04:09] declare amen that Jesus Christ is God
[1:04:12] Amen he's a Healer he's a savior he's a
[1:04:15] deliverer come on church amen how easy
[1:04:18] would it have been for him to come
[1:04:20] before the boy down on all fours being
[1:04:22] led around by a chain amen and backed up
[1:04:24] and said well that's a little too hard
[1:04:26] amen but he stood there and he declared
[1:04:29] the same God that saved my soul amen can
[1:04:31] save the soul that's in that boy because
[1:04:33] he is a savior and he is a redeemer now
[1:04:36] I love how John writes here in first
[1:04:38] John 1 3 he said that which we have seen
[1:04:41] and heard amen declare we unto you that
[1:04:44] ye Also may have fellowship with us amen
[1:04:47] and truly our fellowship is with the
[1:04:49] father and with his son Jesus Christ can
[1:04:51] I can I just lay a few words in here
[1:04:53] amen look at this word scene the Bible
[1:04:55] says amen which we have seen that word
[1:04:57] means to see with the eye it means to
[1:05:00] see with the mind or to receive it means
[1:05:02] to know to become acquainted with by
[1:05:04] experience a minute it means this word
[1:05:07] gives prominence Amen to the Discerning
[1:05:10] mind when the physical side recedes amen
[1:05:13] this word that knows perception in
[1:05:15] general amen as resulting princely
[1:05:17] principally amen from Vision the
[1:05:20] prominence being in the mental element
[1:05:21] so when you see something amen it's
[1:05:24] actually coming from The Faculty of
[1:05:26] vision and you all know the Bible says
[1:05:28] where there is no vision amen the people
[1:05:30] will perish so if there's no vision then
[1:05:33] there's nothing to see and if there's
[1:05:35] nothing to see there's nothing to hear
[1:05:36] and if there's nothing to hear there's
[1:05:38] nothing to declare amen but I say to you
[1:05:41] this morning we have a vision amen and
[1:05:43] it's a real Vision it's a true Vision
[1:05:45] amen it's the word of God we have seen
[1:05:48] the vision of God's word he said we have
[1:05:50] seen and we have heard that word heard
[1:05:52] amen means not to be death amen it means
[1:05:55] to perceive by the ear amen what is
[1:05:57] announced in one's presence amen so when
[1:06:00] something is seen are announced by
[1:06:02] Vision amen you perceive it by the ear
[1:06:05] amen then you actually have the ability
[1:06:07] to speak what you have seen and what you
[1:06:10] have heard amen it means to learn to
[1:06:12] give ear to amen a teaching or a teacher
[1:06:15] so when you hear something amen you're
[1:06:17] giving your ear Amen to hear you're
[1:06:20] giving your ear to receive what is being
[1:06:22] given I love this one to declare it
[1:06:25] means to bring Tidings back from a
[1:06:27] person or a thing amen it means to bring
[1:06:29] a word to bring a report amen I love
[1:06:31] this one it means to Proclaim and to
[1:06:34] make known openly amen when you declare
[1:06:37] something there is no hesitation when
[1:06:39] you declare something there is no
[1:06:41] reservation you are declaring what I
[1:06:43] have seen and what I've heard amen is
[1:06:45] worthy to be told again it's worthy Amen
[1:06:48] to be repeated and I'll say this I
[1:06:50] believe that God Amen has sent us a
[1:06:52] message in this generation amen and it
[1:06:55] ought to be the faculty it ought to be
[1:06:57] the focus point it ought to be amen it
[1:06:59] ought to be more than just books on the
[1:07:00] shelf and I'm to be more than just tapes
[1:07:02] in the library or on your iPhone amen
[1:07:05] but this message ought to be the
[1:07:06] preeminence of every Church it ought to
[1:07:09] be the preeminence of her home it ought
[1:07:11] to be the preeminence of every Ministry
[1:07:13] listen friends we're not holding a
[1:07:15] Baptist idea we're not fellowshipping
[1:07:17] around a Pentecostal idea amen but this
[1:07:19] message is first John 1 it's the life of
[1:07:22] God that has come into this Hey listen
[1:07:24] they've seen it they heard it amen but
[1:07:27] nobody could declare it like this age
[1:07:29] amen but in this age the Revelation has
[1:07:31] come and we have seen the revelation we
[1:07:34] have heard the Revelation but now
[1:07:36] there's a voice upon the Earth Amen to
[1:07:38] declare that God is God and His word is
[1:07:41] true and his power is here listen we're
[1:07:43] not playing good church we're not
[1:07:45] playing with this message amen we've
[1:07:47] been anointed to declare it
[1:07:49] you say well I'm young declare it anyhow
[1:07:52] well I'm old declared anyhow well I'm
[1:07:54] not rich declare it anyhow well I've got
[1:07:56] money amen whatever position you're in
[1:07:59] in life forget that position and declare
[1:08:02] the word of God it's the life that is
[1:08:05] coming to this age amen now when you
[1:08:07] begin to declare this John goes on to
[1:08:09] say Amen we write these things unto you
[1:08:12] that's your joy may be full amen so
[1:08:15] we've just identified the source of joy
[1:08:17] in the church it is coming from what we
[1:08:20] have seen and what we've heard and what
[1:08:22] we are declaring then he said this then
[1:08:24] is the message somebody say the message
[1:08:26] this then is the message which we have
[1:08:29] heard of him and we declare unto you
[1:08:32] that God is light and in him is no
[1:08:35] Darkness at all Reverend said now he
[1:08:37] reveals these things by his
[1:08:39] foreknowledge to those who he has
[1:08:42] ordained to these things otherwise they
[1:08:45] don't see it see amen standing right
[1:08:47] there looking right at it and he cannot
[1:08:49] see it he said how many ever seen the
[1:08:51] picture of a cow in the bush that you
[1:08:54] just have to look and look did you ever
[1:08:56] see that or seen the picture of Christ
[1:08:57] in the bush or in the sky or clouds amen
[1:09:00] see that painter has got that fixed up
[1:09:02] so well to when you just have to look at
[1:09:05] it at a certain way amen so you you
[1:09:07] can't just glance at it and see it you
[1:09:09] can't just walk by it and look at it and
[1:09:11] see it but you've got to actually begin
[1:09:13] to study over it and then you got to
[1:09:15] begin to pour into it amen if you're
[1:09:17] going to find the picture you've got to
[1:09:19] look at it in a certain way y'all ever
[1:09:21] been out in Arizona and actually in the
[1:09:23] mountains amen is a profile of William
[1:09:26] Branham amen you stand there and
[1:09:28] somebody say over there it's a profile
[1:09:30] of a prophet's face amen when you can
[1:09:32] stand there and look at it amen and most
[1:09:34] people will never see it amen but
[1:09:36] somebody found it because they didn't
[1:09:38] just look at it amen but they begin to
[1:09:40] study it and when they studied it they
[1:09:42] seem there amen is a prophets facing the
[1:09:45] mountain listen friends if you look at
[1:09:47] this message the only thing you're going
[1:09:48] to see is about the quotes and
[1:09:50] scriptures and ideas but if you'll begin
[1:09:52] to study this message Amen in a certain
[1:09:55] way it'll begin to unlock an anointing
[1:09:57] in your life it'll begin to release a
[1:09:59] power among church I think it's high
[1:10:01] time Amen to get back to studying the
[1:10:03] message amen quick just well God have
[1:10:06] mercy I might as well preach amen these
[1:10:08] tapes are not just room noise amen these
[1:10:10] books are not just books to flip through
[1:10:12] before service amen but we ought to
[1:10:14] ponder over these things we ought to lay
[1:10:16] in these things we ought to give our
[1:10:18] lives Amen to we see what a prophet was
[1:10:21] saying listen if you don't look at it in
[1:10:23] a certain way you're never going to see
[1:10:24] the picture he said well then when you
[1:10:26] once see it amen you can't see nothing
[1:10:29] else amen so until you looked at it in a
[1:10:31] certain way you never seen it but
[1:10:33] brother Matt when you actually saw it
[1:10:35] amen then you can't see nothing else I
[1:10:38] remember one time Isaac Hatfield now
[1:10:39] amen we were taking a float trip down
[1:10:42] the New River we're just going down
[1:10:43] through there and this guy told us he
[1:10:45] said look at that rock he said in the
[1:10:47] 70s they said that rock looked like an
[1:10:49] elephant he said look at that rock in
[1:10:51] the in the 70s they said that rock
[1:10:53] looked like a lion amen now when you go
[1:10:55] by there look at them rocks amen before
[1:10:57] somebody told me I did not see what they
[1:11:00] were talking about amen but now when I
[1:11:02] go by them rocks I can see it because I
[1:11:05] saw it
[1:11:06] well I feel good I can see it because I
[1:11:10] saw it and now I can't see nothing else
[1:11:12] oh church are you hearing me when you
[1:11:15] see this message is Rapture and Faith
[1:11:17] you can't see nothing else when you see
[1:11:19] this message it's the power to make you
[1:11:21] an invincible Army you can't see nothing
[1:11:24] else when you see this is revelation 10
[1:11:26] and Malachi 4 and Luke 17 30 and John 3
[1:11:30] and John 4 when you see this message
[1:11:32] amen you can't see nothing else he said
[1:11:35] because there it is he said well that's
[1:11:37] the same way it is with Christ is
[1:11:39] himself amen the gospel the message is
[1:11:42] when you once see the message of the
[1:11:44] hour he said there's nothing else you
[1:11:46] can see amen but that that's all he said
[1:11:50] everything else is gone amen the rest of
[1:11:52] it is just a filler see when you once
[1:11:55] see the message that's why I don't study
[1:11:58] Dr Dobson that's why I don't pour into
[1:12:00] Matthew Henry that's why I don't lay in
[1:12:02] Charles person that's why I don't study
[1:12:04] all these reformers amen because cause
[1:12:06] yeah they had good points amen but I've
[1:12:09] seen the message amen and the rest of it
[1:12:11] is just feeling and I might as well
[1:12:13] preach that now amen I think it's time
[1:12:15] we load our sermons up amen with things
[1:12:18] that a prophet taught I'm not talking
[1:12:19] about surfing Google amen and finding a
[1:12:22] good few little fiery points I'm talking
[1:12:24] about laying them tapes and laying them
[1:12:26] books until you catch a revelation of
[1:12:29] what a prophet was trying to establish
[1:12:30] and then you can come to the puppy and
[1:12:32] you can face any devil any Spirit any
[1:12:35] pressure and you will not withdraw
[1:12:37] yourself you will not become timid you
[1:12:39] will not back away you will stand there
[1:12:41] in a vow and declare with everything
[1:12:43] that's within you I believe what I'm
[1:12:45] saying because it is a revelation to me
[1:12:49] say in the to the hour amen is a
[1:12:52] personal contact amen with the person of
[1:12:54] the message you say well who's the
[1:12:56] person of the message well don't get mad
[1:12:58] at me amen but brother branham's not the
[1:13:00] person of the message don't get mad at
[1:13:02] me Amen brother Sean brother brother Ron
[1:13:04] brother Tim amen any preacher I brother
[1:13:06] Wayne any preacher is not the person of
[1:13:09] the message amen the person of the
[1:13:12] message is Jesus Christ probably God
[1:13:15] said before you come out and confess the
[1:13:16] Holy Ghost he said confess you have the
[1:13:19] baptism he said there ought to be such a
[1:13:21] personal contact with God until all the
[1:13:23] intellectuals in the world Amen could
[1:13:26] not explain it away from you he said you
[1:13:28] know because you've been there you've
[1:13:30] had the witness and you know it's the
[1:13:32] truth he said another place we get so
[1:13:34] soured down on theology till we don't
[1:13:37] know nothing about the spirit he said I
[1:13:39] hope you love me after this amen I'm
[1:13:41] talking to Pentecost too amen just
[1:13:43] shouting and dancing around doesn't mean
[1:13:45] you know anything about the spirit he
[1:13:48] said it's a personal contact amen face
[1:13:51] to face that's what you need amen that's
[1:13:53] a kind amen of church God's fixing to
[1:13:56] raise up amen that's right when they
[1:13:58] come together in the unity and the power
[1:14:00] of the spirit amen God is not raising up
[1:14:03] a church that is looking at him from a
[1:14:05] distance he's not racing up a church
[1:14:07] that is looking at him and does not know
[1:14:09] him face to face amen but he's going to
[1:14:12] raise up a church amen that's going to
[1:14:14] know him Amen in the power of this
[1:14:17] Resurrection listen they're going to
[1:14:19] know what he looks like they're going to
[1:14:20] know his nature they're going to know
[1:14:22] his characteristics you know why because
[1:14:23] they've not just taken a glance brother
[1:14:25] will they have seen him in a certain way
[1:14:28] and they can't unseen somebody say face
[1:14:30] to face amen face to face Amen brother
[1:14:33] Matt would you come here for a second
[1:14:34] would you help me amen amen we're going
[1:14:37] to see God Amen face to face amen face

[1:14:58] around amen and I look at him amen I'm
[1:15:01] looking at him face to face I know what
[1:15:03] he looks like amen I can shake his hand
[1:15:06] I can have fellowship with him thank you

[1:15:10] face-to-face experience thank you buddy
[1:15:12] amen are you hearing me church this
[1:15:15] message was not you looking at God Amen
[1:15:17] from a distance through a denomination
[1:15:19] amen this message was the person of
[1:15:21] Jesus Christ they've been coming into
[1:15:23] the church and he was not facing the
[1:15:26] wall he was not facing the corner but
[1:15:28] he's looking at you come on church do
[1:15:30] you realize this message takes you back
[1:15:32] Amen to a river of Jordan experience
[1:15:34] when the Bible said John was baptized in
[1:15:37] Jesus in the river and he said the word
[1:15:39] came to the word he said the word stood
[1:15:42] face to face with a word and this
[1:15:44] message is the meeting amen of the face
[1:15:46] of the written word with the face of the
[1:15:49] predestinated word he meant to manifest
[1:15:51] the promise of the word in the age that
[1:15:53] you're living no matter how you know the
[1:15:55] word is true amen is going to contact
[1:15:57] you got to see it he's going to turn
[1:16:00] around you got to turn around you got to
[1:16:03] look at him you gotta shake his hand you
[1:16:05] got to feel his presence oh I say oh God
[1:16:07] this morning come in our church amen and
[1:16:10] look at us Lord let us fill your
[1:16:12] presence let us touch your hands let us
[1:16:15] feel your anointing we want to know you
[1:16:17] so we can hear you we can see you and we
[1:16:20] can declare you then you see all the
[1:16:22] things you've done amen when you know
[1:16:24] it's the truth then you're on the right
[1:16:26] road and it will always be scripture
[1:16:28] amen as long as brother Mass looking at
[1:16:30] the wall I cannot have Fellowship amen
[1:16:33] but when we come face to face when we
[1:16:35] come face to face we come in contact
[1:16:37] then we can have fellowship and John
[1:16:40] said this which we have seen heard
[1:16:42] declare we unto you amen that ye Also
[1:16:45] may have fellowship with us amen so they
[1:16:47] were declaring this to you so that you
[1:16:49] could come and to a Unity into a
[1:16:52] fellowship amen not just with him amen
[1:16:55] but truly our fellowship is with the
[1:16:57] father and with his son Jesus Christ
[1:16:59] look at this word Fellowship it is
[1:17:01] Association it is a communion it is a
[1:17:04] joint participation Amen to share which
[1:17:07] one has anything amen and intimacy it's
[1:17:10] the right hand as a sign and a pledge of
[1:17:12] Fellowship amen I love this one brother
[1:17:14] Sean it is exhibiting amen and
[1:17:16] embodiment when you are fellowshipping
[1:17:19] you are exhibiting an embodiment and
[1:17:22] proof of Fellowship oh I feel like
[1:17:24] shouting amen what were they writing to
[1:17:27] you so that the god they were writing
[1:17:29] about amen could look you face to face
[1:17:31] and he could come into your soul he
[1:17:34] could come into your life and you could
[1:17:36] see him not as he was but as he is I
[1:17:39] love what the prophet says rich and
[1:17:40] mercy he said many of you can fellowship
[1:17:42] with me on this thought when you was a
[1:17:45] little boy amen or a little girl you
[1:17:46] walk around there were certain things
[1:17:48] where it wouldn't bother other kids
[1:17:49] seemed like there was nothing in you or
[1:17:51] there was something in you rather that
[1:17:53] cried out he said that was God somewhere
[1:17:55] amen yet you were a sinner amen there
[1:17:59] was something in you oh god there was
[1:18:01] something in me wanting to talk to
[1:18:03] brother Matt there was something in me
[1:18:05] wanting to fellowship with him amen but
[1:18:06] I had not seen him he said now watch
[1:18:09] amen what was that that was the little
[1:18:11] form of life that was in you then then
[1:18:14] after a while you heard the gospel and
[1:18:16] maybe you went to church and picked this
[1:18:18] out and pick that out you went from
[1:18:20] denomination to the nomination but one
[1:18:22] day somebody shot one day amen but one
[1:18:25] day you being a part of God you had to
[1:18:28] be a part of the word and when you heard
[1:18:30] the word you knew where you come from
[1:18:32] and you know what was the truth see you
[1:18:35] are always the seed amen the seed was in
[1:18:38] you always listen amen amen when when
[1:18:41] the quickening power of the Holy Ghost
[1:18:44] came across that form of life on the
[1:18:46] inside of you sister Becky it was the
[1:18:48] Turning of God Amen from looking away
[1:18:51] from you Amen to looking at you Amen to
[1:18:54] a union a fellowship by the blood oh God
[1:18:57] he said the word sing the word that was
[1:19:00] in you that was before the foundation of
[1:19:03] the world Amen saw the word and you come
[1:19:06] to it and then the word in you saw the
[1:19:09] word and you come to it in other words
[1:19:11] the reason we can't leave amen as we
[1:19:13] were called by the word oh I feel like
[1:19:16] shouting on that point we were not
[1:19:18] called by a preacher we were not called
[1:19:20] by a denomination we were not called by
[1:19:23] an association we were called by the
[1:19:25] word
[1:19:27] if if we're going to get run off the
[1:19:30] work's gonna have to do it amen cause we
[1:19:32] didn't come in by handshake amen so
[1:19:34] somebody not shaking our hand can't run
[1:19:36] us off we didn't come in by recognition
[1:19:38] in the church so somebody not
[1:19:40] recognizing Us in the church will not
[1:19:41] run us off we came in by the voice of
[1:19:44] God Amen to the revelation of Jesus
[1:19:47] Christ calling our name positionally

[1:19:51] word yes sir amen the written word this
[1:19:54] written word right here amen was the
[1:19:56] word that was looking for the word you
[1:19:58] say well that Bible wasn't in me you're
[1:20:00] exactly right this physical Bible of
[1:20:03] pink of paper and ink and leather it was
[1:20:05] not in you but there was a gene seed of
[1:20:08] God that was in you which the prophet
[1:20:10] said was the predestinated word so this
[1:20:13] written word begin to be preached and
[1:20:15] when that word begin to be oh God when
[1:20:18] it began to be preached that
[1:20:20] predestinated word on the inside of you
[1:20:21] said Mama that's me he's talking about
[1:20:24] me he's fellowshipping with me come on
[1:20:27] what was it it was the eagle amen coming
[1:20:30] back to Eagle amen it was seed coming
[1:20:32] back to seed then I say this morning
[1:20:34] church the only thing that will reveal
[1:20:36] you as an eagle is the message the only
[1:20:38] thing that will reveal you as a part of
[1:20:40] the word is the message the only thing
[1:20:42] that will reveal to you that you have a
[1:20:45] future in the middle of laodicea is this
[1:20:47] message then why wouldn't we declare
[1:20:49] this message then why wouldn't we
[1:20:51] declare what a prophet said it's the
[1:20:53] only thing that has the power Amen to
[1:20:55] break away the clouds to break away the
[1:20:57] doubt and to bring that seed on the
[1:20:59] inside of you
[1:21:01] I'm telling you Church you didn't claim
[1:21:03] this message this message claims you
[1:21:05] amen you did not claim Malachi 4 Malachi
[1:21:09] 4 claims you and then what are you
[1:21:11] saying I'm saying this we were claimed
[1:21:13] by the message well that's enough to
[1:21:15] shout on for an hour brother Kevin we
[1:21:18] were claimed by the message that's why
[1:21:20] John said this then is the message amen
[1:21:23] the life of God claiming you
[1:21:26] this then is the message which we have
[1:21:29] heard of him and we declare unto you
[1:21:31] that God is light and in him is no
[1:21:34] Darkness at all amen listen to prophet
[1:21:36] he says the laodicean age is supposed to
[1:21:39] receive a message Malachi 4 said they
[1:21:42] would what house will you build me we as
[1:21:44] this group of people we have a message
[1:21:46] for this day
[1:21:48] and we Fellowship on that fault we're
[1:21:51] not looking for a message we have a
[1:21:53] message amen and we believe that God has
[1:21:56] given us a message so this message has
[1:21:59] not come from a man this message has
[1:22:01] come from God then if this message comes
[1:22:04] from God you know what it'll be it will
[1:22:06] be a scriptural message because the
[1:22:08] prophet of God said anyone knows
[1:22:09] everyone knows that God sends a sign if
[1:22:12] it's a supernatural sign he sends a
[1:22:15] message with that sign always does never
[1:22:17] fails we see things it's not signs of
[1:22:19] God he said well then it won't be
[1:22:21] nothing because God isn't in it but when
[1:22:23] God is in it a message is going to
[1:22:25] follow that amen and that message must
[1:22:28] be from the scripture amen it must be a
[1:22:30] scriptural message it must come thus
[1:22:33] saith the Lord amen when you see a sign
[1:22:36] amen if God is in that sign amen your
[1:22:39] reason your sin that sign is to get your
[1:22:41] attention because there's a message
[1:22:43] following the sign I'm only preached at
[1:22:46] the voice of the sign he said see this
[1:22:48] man but believe the voice I tell you why
[1:22:51] we had people ran off in left field amen
[1:22:53] and went from believing the sign to
[1:22:55] rejecting the sign it's because they did
[1:22:57] not obey what a prophet said he never
[1:22:59] put emphasis on just believing the sign
[1:23:01] he said you see the sign but you believe
[1:23:04] the voice and there's a bride here today
[1:23:06] amen that trouble cannot run her off
[1:23:09] amen failures cannot stop her situations
[1:23:12] cannot defeat her because she's not just
[1:23:14] following a sign amen but she's heard
[1:23:16] the voice and what the voice said amen
[1:23:19] she's seen the sign and she's declaring
[1:23:22] this is the Fulfillment of the life of
[1:23:24] God in this age to manifest
[1:23:27] rather Hallelujah then what are you
[1:23:29] talking about we have come to the saith
[1:23:32] the Lord we have come to Vindicated
[1:23:33] words he said we're living in a day
[1:23:35] where all kinds of things are strange
[1:23:37] isms that's unscriptural but you just
[1:23:39] remember as it was in the days of Noah
[1:23:42] he said you know people perhaps built
[1:23:44] boats in them days whether they were God
[1:23:46] constructed or not they didn't float
[1:23:47] when the time come for it to float he
[1:23:49] said so I like the message to be God
[1:23:52] constructed with the scriptures I like
[1:23:55] the message to be God constructed with
[1:23:58] the scriptures amen a scriptural message
[1:24:00] right there with it everything with the
[1:24:02] scripture amen then it's thus saith the
[1:24:06] Lord amen then and it's got to stand
[1:24:08] because it isn't my word that's in
[1:24:10] question it'll be his word that's in
[1:24:12] question amen bring it from the
[1:24:15] scripture amen don't bring it from an
[1:24:17] idea don't bring it from a tradition
[1:24:19] bring the message from the scripture
[1:24:21] it's okay this morning for a few moments
[1:24:24] I would like to tell you from the
[1:24:25] messenger the scriptural messenger sure
[1:24:28] amen what the message is I went through
[1:24:30] a study the other day amen in Israel in
[1:24:32] the church part five he said the message
[1:24:34] is ready so we now know the message is
[1:24:37] ready and he said the power of God is
[1:24:39] sufficient so the message is ready and
[1:24:42] the power of God is sufficient men and
[1:24:45] women are scared to break out yonder
[1:24:47] into those fears before God and there to
[1:24:49] trust him and take his word that's where
[1:24:52] you got to declare that the message is
[1:24:54] ready and the power is sufficient you've
[1:24:56] got to declare it before the people
[1:24:58] because there's a fear upon the church
[1:25:00] amen to break out in those Realms with
[1:25:02] God where all things are possible but
[1:25:04] listen friends the prophet has done been
[1:25:06] there and he's come back with a report
[1:25:08] that is real and we've got rights to go
[1:25:11] into it amen he said another place you
[1:25:13] don't come to church just to hear a
[1:25:15] message or to see a messenger you come
[1:25:17] to hear the message and the message is
[1:25:20] the holy spirit amen taking the word of
[1:25:23] God and giving it to you another place
[1:25:25] he said now if I understand the
[1:25:26] scripture right I believe that there's
[1:25:28] gifts that comes into the church that
[1:25:30] the Holy Spirit speaks and pronounces to
[1:25:32] his people the things he wants to do and
[1:25:35] therefore the people who spoke who's
[1:25:37] just in order after I got through

[1:34:56] declaring the trash and start declaring
[1:34:58] the righteousness let me tell you what
[1:35:00] the devil said you're not worthy but my
[1:35:02] Bible said he made you worthy the devil
[1:35:04] said he's not going to make it amen but
[1:35:06] my Bible said you've already made it the
[1:35:08] devil said I'm against you but my Bible
[1:35:10] said greater is he that is in you when
[1:35:12] he that is against you well the devil
[1:35:14] said I'm going to fall apart well my
[1:35:16] Bible said amen that he that has begun a

[1:39:05] Mount Transfiguration is the same one
[1:39:08] that is like the son of man in the Book
[1:39:10] of Revelation the first chapter then
[1:39:12] Church of the Living God if you are
[1:39:14] following the message of the hour you

[1:39:20] same voice that was upon Mount Sania you
[1:39:22] are following the same voice that was on
[1:39:25] Mount Transfiguration you're following
[1:39:27] the same voice that was on Mount Sunset
[1:39:29] you're following the same voice that was
[1:39:31] on Mount Calvary come on turn that same
[1:39:34] voice is in the church this morning and
[1:39:36] it's sounding Out and somebody's going
[1:39:38] to declare it oh I love what Revelation
[1:39:40] 3 8 says it says I Know Thy Works amen I
[1:39:43] love this part behold I have set before

[1:39:57] and it's kept my word and has not denied
[1:40:00] my name can I can I lay this in for a
[1:40:02] minute an open door he said what was it
[1:40:05] it was the revelation of the Supreme
[1:40:07] deity of Jesus Christ not being a second
[1:40:10] person of the Trinity but being God
[1:40:12] himself made flesh and dwelling Among Us
[1:40:14] he said no man can shut that door are
[1:40:17] you ready for this so there's nobody
[1:40:19] could ever stop that message
[1:40:23] nobody could shut the door so the door
[1:40:26] is connected to the message he said
[1:40:28] nobody could stop that message of
[1:40:30] supreme deity and the baptism of in the
[1:40:33] name of Jesus Christ he said the Gates
[1:40:35] of Hell will never Prevail against him

[1:54:51] the message I am not going to reduce
[1:54:53] this message down to a bunch of
[1:54:55] preachers sitting around trying to
[1:54:56] discern and decided ID in the direction
[1:54:58] I'm going to say what a prophet said and
[1:55:01] wherever God gives me the grace to hold
[1:55:02] a microphone I'm going to preach this

[1:55:09] message church I get to preach in I'm
[1:55:11] going to preach the message and I'm
[1:55:13] going to stand back and let the message
[1:55:15] fix situations fix divisions fix
[1:55:17] confusion come on church if the message
[1:55:20] can't fix a division it ain't going to
[1:55:22] change your body but if this message is
[1:55:24] going to change your body brother will
[1:55:26] you better believe this caught enough
[1:55:27] power Amen to bring every direction back
[1:55:29] to the center of the road the message of
[1:55:32] the hour and let the message become the
[1:55:34] god

[1:55:49] scripture correction he gets all angry
[1:55:51] and blows up it shows he's not right
[1:55:53] with God Amen but a genuine saint of God
[1:55:56] will be reconciled to God by the word

[1:56:11] to the gifts it'll bring a balance to it
[1:56:13] if you just preach the message it has
[1:56:16] the power to bring the balance but if
[1:56:19] you don't declare it then there's
[1:56:20] nothing else to fix it so it becomes a
[1:56:22] bunch of Babylonian confusion of
[1:56:25] dictators fussing and fine oh God I
[1:56:27] might as well preach amen and pulpits no

[1:57:51] wouldn't be so much confusion you say
[1:57:53] well what's going to fix it the message
[1:57:54] of the hour is going to fix it that's
[1:57:56] why you better play them tapes that's
[1:57:58] why you better turn on them books that's
[1:58:00] why you better get some prayer you
[1:58:02] better get some anointing because
[1:58:03] there's nothing going to fix it but for
[1:58:05] message

[1:58:08] and a Pulpit in my home but you got the
[1:58:10] tapes and you can gather your little
[1:58:12] family together and you can pour that
[1:58:14] message into him you can say we're not

[1:58:18] going to follow the trends of laodice
[1:58:19] come on you know what else you can say
[1:58:21] you can say we're not going to Bow our
[1:58:23] knee to the pressures around the message
[1:58:25] we are going to be a message believing
[1:58:27] family because our purpose only Earth is
[1:58:29] to declare this word now he genuine
[1:58:33] right now my people say well you can't
[1:58:34] you can't Strike Back well if you're
[1:58:35] amongst believer as you can
[1:58:39] and before you judge that statement I'll
[1:58:41] read you the quote he said the genuine
[1:58:43] saint of God will be reconciled to God
[1:58:44] by the word
[1:58:46] I'm I'm hurrying but I'm gonna finish
[1:58:49] this so what is the message the message
[1:58:51] is the correcting and a genuine saint of
[1:58:54] God can take the correction he says what
[1:58:56] is the message 1964 to bring back the
[1:58:59] word
[1:59:02] brother Maurice bring back the word
[1:59:04] watch this bring the people back to the
[1:59:07] word
[1:59:09] now don't get mad at me but the pulpit's
[1:59:12] not the place for personal convictions
[1:59:14] all right
[1:59:15] the pulpit is the place for the word
[1:59:18] but because I'm gonna get in trouble
[1:59:21] sure the world but because personal
[1:59:22] convictions invaded the pulpit
[1:59:26] guy's got too lazy to study
[1:59:30] so it's a lot easier just to get up and
[1:59:31] hold a microphone and just preach their
[1:59:33] personal convictions and that's why we
[1:59:35] had churches divided on open-toed shoes
[1:59:37] and Die in Your Hair what kind
[1:59:39] y'all know I'm telling you the truth
[1:59:42] it's in the message amen and so guys
[1:59:45] didn't say the message so they got up
[1:59:46] blasted hair dye and then when somebody
[1:59:48] brought in the cult where a prophet had
[1:59:50] rested they held onto their personal
[1:59:51] conviction because they thought they
[1:59:53] were more spiritual than the prophet and
[1:59:54] you've had divisions for years but just
[1:59:57] preach the message
[1:59:59] the message will fix it amen amen so
[2:00:03] much how are we going to get makeup out
[2:00:04] of the church Preach the message
[2:00:05] somebody say how are we going to get the
[2:00:07] skirts longer preach the message how are
[2:00:09] we going to get shorts off of boys
[2:00:11] preach them y'all know I'm telling you
[2:00:13] the truth amen legalistic Devils harder
[2:00:15] than been fired 10 years ago it's time
[2:00:17] to preach the message and it left a
[2:00:19] message fix the dress that's a Mexican
[2:00:21] that's a message fix the face come on
[2:00:24] sir have we got so powered down if the
[2:00:27] message can change our body but it can't
[2:00:28] change the clothes we're wearing have we
[2:00:30] got so late have we got so weak that we
[2:00:32] preach where the message can do anything
[2:00:34] but it cannot fix the situation listen
[2:00:36] I'll lay before this message and I'll
[2:00:38] preach with everything within me you
[2:00:40] know why because I know it'll fix it I
[2:00:42] am a witness that's a message every hour
[2:00:44] we'll fix the situation if you'll just
[2:00:47] preach it if you'll just preach it if
[2:00:49] you'll just preach it I'm gonna end this
[2:00:51] is if you'll just believe it
[2:00:53] if you'll just believe it it'll fix it
[2:00:56] well brother Andrew
[2:00:58] I don't know how I got here but I'm here
[2:01:00] should we have televisions or should we
[2:01:02] not so we had some guy that wanted to go
[2:01:05] so far in law and we had some guy want
[2:01:07] to go so far in Grace instead of just
[2:01:09] saying what a prophet said
[2:01:12] yeah
[2:01:13] so they went so far in grace to say well
[2:01:15] if you got a cell phone you can have a
[2:01:17] television
[2:01:18] and they went so far in law well if for
[2:01:20] television you got a computer and you
[2:01:22] got a computer where you're not even a
[2:01:23] ride member and you're going hey well
[2:01:25] just say what a prophet said you know
[2:01:27] what he said he said I wouldn't have one
[2:01:29] in my home sandals had enough for me
[2:01:36] I may be you may not want me to preach
[2:01:38] tonight
[2:01:39] are you hearing me just preach the
[2:01:41] message so now we're not arguing
[2:01:44] says okay now we're not arguing over the
[2:01:46] rest now we're arguing over emotion
[2:01:48] we'll just preach the message because if
[2:01:50] you'll say what the prophet said it'll
[2:01:52] bring about you so you got one guy over
[2:01:54] here well bless God we don't want no
[2:01:55] bubble dance or no moving to the Holy
[2:01:56] Ghost okay you got quotes for that but
[2:01:58] then you got other coaches says I'd
[2:02:00] rather have a wildfire than on fire at
[2:02:02] all so then you've got guys over here
[2:02:03] with host clubs and then you got Wars
[2:02:05] going on and you got people going to
[2:02:06] meetings and they don't know how to
[2:02:08] react because we're under so many
[2:02:10] but what if we would lay aside our
[2:02:12] personality and we would lay aside our
[2:02:14] ideas and we would humble ourselves and
[2:02:17] lift up the seventh Angels message again
[2:02:19] it had fixed the division it would fix
[2:02:21] the confusion they said I'm moving on
[2:02:23] from this point but I'm going to say
[2:02:24] this as for me and my house we're going
[2:02:26] to serve the word as for me and my
[2:02:28] family we're going to lay in these tapes
[2:02:30] we're going to preach this message I'm
[2:02:32] going to preach it somebody's going to
[2:02:34] believe it I refuse to get bowed down
[2:02:36] and countered down in a bunch of fussing
[2:02:38] and fighting listen we got young people
[2:02:40] on their way out the door while we're
[2:02:41] facing over this and fussing over that I
[2:02:43] say lay down the swords against each
[2:02:45] other and pick up the sword of the Lord
[2:02:47] and fight that devil down until we
[2:02:49] restore our young people until we
[2:02:51] restore our churches
[2:02:55] bring them back to the word you know why
[2:02:57] because the word corrects the error
[2:03:00] the word
[2:03:03] corrects the error
[2:03:06] hereby know we the spirit of truth and
[2:03:10] the spirit of error listen father God
[2:03:13] said Airway shows or definition error
[2:03:16] which shows yourself an action a wrong
[2:03:19] mode of acting error which leads in the
[2:03:22] air into further error this Seton fraud
[2:03:26] can I tell you this you're never going
[2:03:28] to fix error by studying error
[2:03:33] okay
[2:03:35] it's an error
[2:03:38] brother Shabbat if you're trying to get
[2:03:39] red paint off a wall you're not going to
[2:03:41] cover it up by putting more red paint on
[2:03:42] it
[2:03:44] it's directions
[2:03:47] probably God said there's a grocery
[2:03:49] today on the godhead but you know what
[2:03:50] corrected item didn't go steady and lay
[2:03:52] out there and all them denominations and
[2:03:54] study their errors and fellowship with
[2:03:55] them he preached the word and the word
[2:03:57] correct to the error you know why and
[2:03:59] I'm going to tie this together you know
[2:04:01] why because Jesus knew he was the word
[2:04:03] so when you know who you are you can
[2:04:06] boldly declare who you are and not be
[2:04:09] ashamed to do so Jesus himself when he
[2:04:11] came he knew he was the words he he was
[2:04:14] pause to that he would can I give you
[2:04:16] something here this morning
[2:04:18] can I give you something you say well
[2:04:19] preacher you're talking about laying
[2:04:21] down the source for the pulpit now let's
[2:04:22] lay him down in the pews
[2:04:24] oh yeah is that okay let's lay them down
[2:04:27] in our meetings see he was positive for
[2:04:30] that he was just 12 years old we found
[2:04:32] him in the temple debating with the
[2:04:33] Priestess his knowledge could surpass
[2:04:34] her traditions and he was teaching him
[2:04:36] and his own mother come to him and said
[2:04:39] a word that was wrong he said now watch
[2:04:41] the word correct the air the word always
[2:04:44] corrects the error and if the people can
[2:04:46] only see today the word corrects the air
[2:04:48] the whole thing and I watch a prophet
[2:04:49] the whole thing is becoming there but
[2:04:52] God's word is what is right see Heaven
[2:04:54] Earth will pass away but my word shall
[2:04:56] not and though are you ready for this
[2:04:58] the word that is prophesied for this day
[2:05:00] is what corrects the error of the day
[2:05:05] so not the word of Luther or the word of
[2:05:08] Wesley or the word of Pentecost or the
[2:05:10] word of Spurgeon or the word of pink or
[2:05:12] the word of hint the word prophesied of
[2:05:15] this day corrects the air see the word
[2:05:17] itself now watch and the word comes back
[2:05:19] and corrects that error are you ready by
[2:05:21] identifying itself the hour and the time
[2:05:24] of the hour this is bright time this is
[2:05:27] bright hour this is bright age see and
[2:05:30] now he said not dishonor you Catholic
[2:05:32] people they call Mary the Mother of God
[2:05:33] but let me just show you an error Jesus
[2:05:35] was told by Mary your father and I have
[2:05:37] been looking for you and you know what
[2:05:39] he's saying know ye not that I must be
[2:05:41] about my father's business watch the
[2:05:43] word correct the air he said now you
[2:05:45] know what 12 year old boy wouldn't do
[2:05:46] that he was the word he was the spoken
[2:05:49] word of that age so therefore the
[2:05:52] identified characteristic of God was in
[2:05:54] Christ and he corrected the Earth listen
[2:05:57] Church Christ was in a 12 year old boy
[2:06:00] and he corrected the heir and said I
[2:06:03] must be about my father's business
[2:06:04] listen everybody this is the word always
[2:06:07] corrects the air are you ready for this
[2:06:08] by identifying God among them so if
[2:06:12] you'll just preach the message the
[2:06:14] message will bring God in the midst and
[2:06:16] God will identify himself another place
[2:06:18] he said let's go back just a minute now
[2:06:19] and identify what Jesus was on Earth and
[2:06:22] we'll find out what he was then what
[2:06:24] he's been in the other ages he'll have
[2:06:26] to be the same thing in this age to make
[2:06:28] it right
[2:06:29] now what are you saying preacher I'm
[2:06:31] saying the message is right
[2:06:34] saying the message is the correcting
[2:06:36] and Jesus said this and I'll be done he
[2:06:38] said if you continue in my word
[2:06:41] then are ye my disciples indeed
[2:06:44] I love this one Sister Kim and you shall
[2:06:47] know the truth and the truth shall make
[2:06:51] you free
[2:06:55] the life
[2:06:56] was manifested
[2:06:59] we've seen it
[2:07:01] we heard it
[2:07:03] now all that God was
[2:07:06] he poured into Christ
[2:07:08] and all that Christ was
[2:07:11] he poured into the church
[2:07:13] whether you stand with Andrew I'm saying
[2:07:15] truth is the word
[2:07:17] says this is our musicians come he said
[2:07:20] now
[2:07:20] he said I don't come as a fanatic I do
[2:07:22] not believe in fanaticism I wouldn't
[2:07:23] stand for that I know you don't believe
[2:07:25] in phoneticism you believe in the truth
[2:07:28] are you ready for this and truth will
[2:07:31] always speak for itself
[2:07:37] Russia my truth got its own voice
[2:07:42] it can speak
[2:07:44] he said that's right are you ready for
[2:07:46] this you never have to strain the truth
[2:07:51] Oh Glory
[2:07:53] that's why you just preached the message
[2:07:54] you never have to strain it you just
[2:07:55] preach it
