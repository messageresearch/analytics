[40:24] having the fall festival.
[40:26] It's going to be on November 2nd, the
[40:28] original date.
[40:31] And um it's going to be at the Pilot
[40:34] Community Center.
[40:36] So just keep that in mind.
[40:39] um the pilot community center and uh um
[40:46] we have um we believe it it'll work for
[40:49] us and um they're only um they're I
[40:54] think well it's going to be 35 a day so
[40:58] $70 so this this is good this is an
[41:02] improvement
[41:04] of the others and so it may not the
[41:10] uh the Hampton Inn
[41:13] or Hilton, but it'll work, right? And
[41:16] so, uh, we just want to remember that.
[41:19] And we appreciate Brother John,
[41:23] uh, looking into that for us. And, um,
[41:27] he, um, um, actually he wanted to pay
[41:31] for it. And we thought it was actually
[41:33] going to be about $200 or so, but, it
[41:35] worked out that, um, it would be about
[41:39] $70. And so we really appreciate brother
[41:41] John to looking into that and helping us
[41:44] out and and uh so looking forward to a
[41:47] wonderful time. Amen. And um so then uh
[41:53] after the service this morning right
[41:56] after um we're going to have a baptism.
[41:59] Um uh Ruth
[42:02] uh she came the other day asking if she
[42:04] could be baptized and and um so uh you
[42:09] know we're thankful for that and and so
[42:12] uh the Lord willing we'll be uh having
[42:15] that right after service and then of
[42:17] course having fellowship after that
[42:21] there at the the frog pond uh just right
[42:23] down the road and uh so believe we'll
[42:27] have a good time today. Uh so let's read
[42:31] uh Deuteronomy the 7th chapter
[42:34] and um
[42:38] I'm going to start at the first verse
[42:40] again.
[42:41] And uh when the Lord thy God shall bring
[42:44] thee into the land, whether thou goest
[42:47] to possess it, and hath cast out many
[42:51] nations before thee, the Hittites,
[42:54] the the Geresites, and the Amorites, the
[42:58] Canaanites, Perizzites, Hivites,
[43:00] Jebusites,
[43:02] seven nations greater and mightier than
[43:04] thou.
[43:06] And when the Lord thy God shall deliver
[43:08] them before thee, thou shalt smite them,
[43:12] and utterly destroy them, thou shalt
[43:16] make no covenant with them, nor show
[43:18] mercy unto them. Neither shalt thou make
[43:22] marriages with them, thy daughter. Thou
[43:26] shalt not give unto his son, nor his
[43:28] daughter shalt thou take unto thy son.
[43:32] For they will turn away thy son from
[43:35] following me.
[43:37] That they may serve other gods, so will
[43:41] the anger of the Lord be kindled against
[43:44] you, and destroy thee suddenly. But thus
[43:48] you shall deal with them. Um, thus shall
[43:51] you deal with them. You shall break
[43:53] down, destroy their altars, break down
[43:56] their images, cut down their groves, and
[43:59] burn their graven images with fire. For
[44:02] thou art an holy people unto the Lord
[44:05] thy God. The Lord thy God hath chosen
[44:07] thee to be a special people unto himself
[44:10] above all people that are upon the face
[44:12] of the earth. The Lord did not set his
[44:15] love upon you, nor choose you, because
[44:17] you were more in number than any people.
[44:19] For you were the fewest of all people,
[44:22] but because the Lord loved you, and
[44:24] because he would keep the oath which he
[44:26] had sworn unto your fathers, that the
[44:29] Lord brought hath the Lord brought you
[44:31] out with a mighty hand, and redeemed you
[44:34] out of the house of bondman, from the
[44:36] hand of Pharaoh, king of Egypt. Know
[44:39] therefore that the Lord thy God, he is
[44:42] God the faithful God, which keepeth
[44:44] covenant and mercy with him that love
[44:46] him and keep his commandments to a
[44:48] thousand generations.
[44:51] Then let's go to the familiar scripture
[44:52] that we've been using and that's Isaiah
[44:55] 43.
[45:01] Isaiah 43 and1
[45:05] we will start. I love how the Lord just
[45:08] expresses the desires of his heart
[45:11] through his promises.
[45:14] But now, thus saith the Lord that
[45:16] created thee, oh Jacob, he that formed
[45:19] thee, oh Israel, fear not, for I have
[45:22] redeemed thee. I have called thee by thy
[45:24] name, thou art mine.
[45:26] When thou passest through the waters, I
[45:29] will be with thee, and through the
[45:30] rivers, they shall not overflow thee.
[45:34] When thou walst through the fire, thou
[45:36] shalt not be burned, neither shall the
[45:39] flame kindle upon thee. He's making it
[45:42] very known, whatever they go through.
[45:45] And we'll put it the way whatever we go
[45:48] through, it ain't going to hurt us for
[45:51] he's with us.
[45:52] &gt;&gt; For I am the holy I am the Lord thy God,
[45:55] the holy one of Israel, thy savior. I
[45:58] gave Egypt for thy ransom Ethiopia and
[46:00] Zeba for thee. Since thou was precious
[46:03] in my sight, thou hast been honorable,
[46:06] and I have loved thee. Therefore will I
[46:08] give men for thee, and people for thy
[46:10] life. Fear not, for I am with thee. I
[46:14] will bring thy seed from the east, and
[46:16] gather thee from the west. I will say to
[46:19] the north, give up, and to the south,
[46:21] keep not back. Bring my sons from afar
[46:26] and my daughters from the ends of the
[46:28] earth, even everyone that is called by
[46:32] my name. For I have created him for my
[46:35] glory. I have formed him. Yay, I have
[46:38] made him. Now, how is he going to
[46:40] gather? By his word. Ain't that right?
[46:44] He gathers by his word. And I was just
[46:47] reading a what the prophet said about
[46:51] the voice of God. He said, "It's the
[46:53] creative voice of God in this day, and
[46:56] it's it's the roll call. It's the roll
[46:59] call. Calling those names that were on
[47:02] the Lamb's Book of Life."
[47:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. Gathering them together. Can you
[47:06] say amen?
[47:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. And this voice has the power to
[47:10] call those out of the grave. It's going
[47:12] to change our bodies. But there's a
[47:15] gathering that's happening now. Ain't
[47:17] that right? And then Acts 1:8.
[47:21] Um,
[47:25] but you shall receive power
[47:28] after that the Holy Ghost has come upon
[47:30] you, and you shall be witnesses unto me,
[47:33] both in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and
[47:36] Samaria, unto the uttermost parts of the
[47:39] earth. Amen.
[47:42] Let's just bow our heads in a word of
[47:44] prayer. Lord Jesus,
[47:49] we believe that we have gathered here
[47:51] not on human strength or human will,
[47:55] but we believe it's divine order. It's
[47:59] an appointment,
[48:02] a divine appointment, Lord, that we're
[48:04] gathered here. There's something Lord
[48:07] within us that woke us up with a desire
[48:11] to come to the house of God,
[48:15] Father. And we believe that this isn't
[48:17] just a natural meeting. It's a an
[48:19] internal something. It's a spiritual
[48:22] thing.
[48:24] and Lord, that when we leave here, we'll
[48:27] be eternally
[48:29] uh better, more prepared, more ready for
[48:34] the event at hand. And Lord, just
[48:37] asking, Father, that you would just have
[48:40] your way, God, just take anything that's
[48:45] not like you, take it out of our lives.
[48:49] Father, may we humble ourselves more to
[48:53] the word of God and
[48:56] learn to be more submitted and surrender
[48:59] to you that you could have your way
[49:01] within us and create
[49:04] a an eternal work within us. Father, I
[49:08] pray that you would bless the people
[49:10] this morning, been faithful, diligent to
[49:13] come, maybe weary in their body, their
[49:17] minds, going through things spiritually
[49:19] or physically, and yet they've come to
[49:22] the house of God to worship you and to
[49:25] show their appreciation to you. And I
[49:28] pray, Father, that you would just anoint
[49:31] the word, anoint the ministering of your
[49:33] word as well as the hearing. We just
[49:36] commit it into your hands now in Jesus
[49:40] Christ's name. And the church says,
[49:43] "Amen." And amen. You can be seated.
[49:49] So going to use the title again,
[49:51] holiness, a people separated unto the
[49:54] Lord.
[49:56] And we've talked about what
[50:00] holiness would be. would be be set
[50:02] apart,
[50:04] sanctified, dedicated, consecrated
[50:08] unto God.
[50:10] And so as the bride of Christ, we are we
[50:14] are to uh be separated
[50:19] um a separated people from the world. a
[50:25] separated from the habits and fashions
[50:30] of the world. Um the Bible tells us you
[50:34] know not to be conformed to the world
[50:37] but be transformed.
[50:40] &gt;&gt; Now just in that scripture there and
[50:42] what the prophet tells us there's two
[50:44] powers at work in this age that we're
[50:48] living in. One power is bringing a
[50:52] deforming. It's a power of uh to deform.
[50:57] So when Paul is saying don't be
[51:00] conformed to the world,
[51:03] don't don't come under the that
[51:05] deforming power
[51:08] that would twist you up and and
[51:12] demoralize you and to make you something
[51:15] that God never intended.
[51:17] &gt;&gt; True. Don't come under that power
[51:20] because that power will conform you to
[51:23] the world but be transformed
[51:26] and and brother Brown said that's
[51:28] another power that's the power of
[51:30] transformation
[51:32] &gt;&gt; ain't that right
[51:33] &gt;&gt; so we are to be different which can only
[51:36] come by the power of transformation you
[51:40] you can't be good enough you can't be
[51:43] more loyal than than any other person to
[51:47] make you good enough. You that that's
[51:50] not you've got to be transformed.
[51:53] &gt;&gt; You got to be transformed. And and and
[51:56] and this transformation cannot come
[52:00] unless our mind is renewed. For that's
[52:04] what Paul said, be transformed by the
[52:07] renewing of your mind. So you can't the
[52:11] the the your mind must be renewed to be
[52:15] come under this power of transformation.
[52:18] Well, the only way to have our minds
[52:21] renewed is to take on the mind of
[52:24] Christ.
[52:25] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? And and brother
[52:28] Brandon would tell us now the things
[52:30] that you once thought upon, it's talking
[52:33] about taking the mind of Christ, being
[52:35] renewed, the things that you once
[52:38] thought upon to be precious, lay that
[52:40] aside
[52:41] &gt;&gt; and be transformed to something else.
[52:45] &gt;&gt; Take on a new thought, take on a new
[52:48] attribute, new mind, new new uh way of
[52:53] life. Be transformed to something else.
[52:56] what you was one time to what you are
[52:59] now. Ain't that right?
[53:02] &gt;&gt; So another place he says we want the
[53:04] mind of Christ or we want the mind that
[53:08] was in Christ to be in us
[53:11] &gt;&gt; that we might be transformed
[53:15] from the natural things of life
[53:18] and be brought in to do the perfect will
[53:21] of God. Amenise the Lord.
[53:23] &gt;&gt; By transformation
[53:25] of God's spirit by his word.
[53:29] &gt;&gt; So then the transformation
[53:32] isn't just mind over matter or just just
[53:37] um what would that word be? Um you know
[53:42] going from one thought to another
[53:44] thought. um uh one doctrine to another
[53:48] doctrine, one school to another school.
[53:52] Um you know, it's it's it's not that,
[53:54] but there's there's got to be this
[53:56] transformation, and the transformation
[53:59] can only come by his word.
[54:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:02] &gt;&gt; And so then the thought would come that
[54:07] uh brother Brown says, "I'm thoroughly
[54:09] convinced that my message comes from
[54:13] God." Amen.
[54:15] &gt;&gt; I'm thoroughly convinced it's not my own
[54:19] fleshly mind puffed up.
[54:22] &gt;&gt; It's the word of God.
[54:25] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[54:27] &gt;&gt; So then I I think we could all say
[54:31] that the power of transformation lays in
[54:34] this message.
[54:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:38] &gt;&gt; In the token he says we're not to come
[54:40] together to talk about the message.
[54:44] We are come together to get in the
[54:46] message and the message is Christ.
[54:50] &gt;&gt; He is the word. That's right. To get
[54:55] into it. Get beneath it.
[55:00] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. That's what we're supposed to
[55:02] do. Ain't that right?
[55:03] &gt;&gt; So, notice what he says. We're to get
[55:05] beneath it. Ain't that right? Get
[55:07] beneath the message. Get into the
[55:10] message. Later on down in that same uh
[55:13] sermon, he says, "You must come under
[55:16] this token,
[55:17] &gt;&gt; God's Holy Spirit."
[55:20] &gt;&gt; And it displays to you Jesus Christ
[55:24] because it comes and lives in you. Can
[55:28] you say amen?
[55:30] &gt;&gt; So he says, "Oh little people, my
[55:34] brother, sister, get under that token
[55:38] quickly.
[55:39] Don't take no substitute. Don't don't
[55:42] don't don't do that. Don't just imagine
[55:45] it. You stay there until you know that
[55:50] the token is applied.
[55:52] &gt;&gt; Until you're whole. He says the mind
[55:56] that was in Christ is in you. Stay there
[56:00] until the mind of Christ is in you.
[56:04] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? That's what happens
[56:06] when you about this message. When you
[56:09] take the message and you believe
[56:11] wholeheartedly,
[56:12] then the mind of Christ comes into you.
[56:17] &gt;&gt; He says, "And and uh the mind that was
[56:20] in Christ is in you until all the
[56:22] nonsense of the world is gone.
[56:26] &gt;&gt; Until the whole heart's desire is him,
[56:31] &gt;&gt; then you know something is happening."
[56:35] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[56:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. So I I I I truly believe that
[56:42] without this message our minds cannot be
[56:46] renewed.
[56:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:49] &gt;&gt; It's time that our minds because God
[56:53] would send the power of transformation.
[56:57] &gt;&gt; This transformation is not just happen
[57:00] when our bodies are changed from mortal
[57:03] to immortal.
[57:05] It's happening now.
[57:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. by the renewing of our mind. Can
[57:10] you say amen?
[57:13] &gt;&gt; So we we find that we're not to be
[57:16] conformed to the world. And and the word
[57:19] conformed again is to give the same
[57:21] shape,
[57:23] &gt;&gt; the same outline or contour
[57:26] &gt;&gt; to bring into harmony or accord to be
[57:31] similar or identical.
[57:34] &gt;&gt; So we're not to give the same shape as
[57:36] the world. not to give the same contour
[57:39] to or to come into harmony with the
[57:43] world or be identical or even similar
[57:48] &gt;&gt; to the world. Can you say amen?
[57:50] &gt;&gt; Now we know that the church and the
[57:52] world has drifted so far
[57:56] &gt;&gt; from from uh the word of God and is
[58:00] continuing to do so. And the prophet
[58:03] tells us why. Because there's a power of
[58:06] deformation.
[58:08] Satan's power is deforming them. Not
[58:12] just the sinners out there, but the
[58:14] churches.
[58:16] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[58:18] &gt;&gt; But we as the bride of Christ are
[58:22] conforming more into the image of God,
[58:26] into the image of Christ till there is a
[58:30] vast difference between the two.
[58:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:35] Ain't that right?
[58:37] &gt;&gt; There is a vast difference between the
[58:39] bride of Christ and the nominal church.
[58:42] &gt;&gt; There's a vast difference between the
[58:44] bride of Christ and the world. There has
[58:47] to be. But why is it? Because mind over
[58:50] matter? No. We're under the power of
[58:54] transformation.
[58:56] We're being transformed
[58:59] by the renewing of our mind. We ought to
[59:03] be thankful that God sent a message.
[59:06] &gt;&gt; We must never let this message become
[59:08] just uh something common to us.
[59:12] &gt;&gt; It's the only way that we can be
[59:14] transformed.
[59:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:17] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[59:19] &gt;&gt; Which makes us an odd people.
[59:23] And and the more we live, the more time
[59:27] uh continues, the more odd we're going
[59:30] to become.
[59:32] Not that we're making ourselves odd, not
[59:34] that we're trying to be different. It's
[59:37] just we believe the message
[59:39] &gt;&gt; and and and we are back to the original
[59:43] thoughts of God.
[59:45] &gt;&gt; The world is becoming more adverse or
[59:49] contrary to the thoughts of God.
[59:52] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? They're getting more
[59:54] ready for judgment.
[59:57] &gt;&gt; We're getting more ready for the
[59:59] rapture. Amen.
[1:00:01] &gt;&gt; We're getting more prepared to be a man
[1:00:04] for the wedding supper of the lamb.
[1:00:08] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[1:00:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:12] So the holiness holiness set apart
[1:00:16] separated.
[1:00:18] It's it's holiness is the way of the
[1:00:21] Christian life.
[1:00:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:23] &gt;&gt; Because it's a separated life. the
[1:00:26] center of doing things. He has his own
[1:00:30] way. The religious church has their own
[1:00:33] way, church members. But the bride has
[1:00:38] has a way of doing things. And the way
[1:00:41] of the bride, the Bible would call, is
[1:00:44] the way of holiness.
[1:00:46] Isaiah 35:8
[1:00:49] it says, "And an highway shall there be
[1:00:53] and a way, and it shall be called the
[1:00:56] way of holiness." Everybody say, "The
[1:00:59] way of holiness."
[1:01:01] &gt;&gt; The unclean shall not pass over it, but
[1:01:04] it shall be for those, the wayfaring
[1:01:08] men,
[1:01:09] though fools shall not heir therein.
[1:01:13] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? So if you notice,
[1:01:16] it'll be a highway. There's a highway
[1:01:20] and a way.
[1:01:22] &gt;&gt; Now, people would call that way the
[1:01:26] highway of holiness.
[1:01:27] &gt;&gt; The prophet said, "It's not the highway
[1:01:30] of holiness. It's the way of holiness."
[1:01:33] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? There's a certain way
[1:01:36] to walk holiness.
[1:01:37] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:01:38] &gt;&gt; It's a way of holiness. And so we think
[1:01:41] of a highway, you know, it's like we get
[1:01:44] down, you know, on the highway here and
[1:01:46] and car going this way and car going
[1:01:49] this way and and one brother, you know,
[1:01:51] he told brother Brandon says, "Man, you
[1:01:54] know, uh, it's dangerous then to get on
[1:01:56] that highway. You're going to get
[1:01:57] killed. You're going to get hit."
[1:01:59] Brother Brandon says, "No, it's not the
[1:02:00] highway that we thinking of. It's a
[1:02:02] oneway.
[1:02:04] Everybody going one way. If you're on
[1:02:06] that highway, you're going one way. Can
[1:02:10] you say amen? And there's a way of
[1:02:12] holiness.
[1:02:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's a one-way street. Now, notice
[1:02:18] the prophet said the way of holiness is
[1:02:20] in the middle of the road, balanced.
[1:02:24] Ain't that right? All the trash is
[1:02:27] washed to either side of the road.
[1:02:30] Brother Brown tells us that on the side
[1:02:32] on one side of the highway is the
[1:02:34] emotional and fanatical side.
[1:02:38] On the other side of the highway is the
[1:02:40] cold formal intellectual side. So he
[1:02:44] says the main thing is right in the
[1:02:47] middle of the road with enough spirit in
[1:02:50] you to keep you warm and moving
[1:02:54] &gt;&gt; and knowing enough to keep yourself
[1:02:56] under obedience to the spirit to move
[1:03:00] just as the spirit moves. Not till, not
[1:03:04] after, just as the spirit moves.
[1:03:09] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:03:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. He says each side of the each side
[1:03:14] is where the offs
[1:03:17] is found. All the heirs are not found in
[1:03:20] the in the middle of the road. The way
[1:03:22] of holiness. The heirs are found on the
[1:03:26] side of the road wrecked up somewhere.
[1:03:30] He said that's where each side is where
[1:03:32] the off falls is found. That's where you
[1:03:35] won this brethren. You went to one side
[1:03:38] and the trinitarian went off to the
[1:03:40] other side. But the true message lays in
[1:03:44] the center of the road.
[1:03:48] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Calvinist goes into
[1:03:51] one side and Arminium goes on the other
[1:03:54] side, but the message stays right in the
[1:03:56] middle of the road. And so when you're
[1:03:59] walking in this way of holiness, you're
[1:04:01] not getting so fanatical to this and
[1:04:04] some extreme to this. You're just
[1:04:06] staying right in the middle of the road
[1:04:09] moving to a rapture.
[1:04:13] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:04:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. So you walk in this way of
[1:04:17] holiness, it separates you because not
[1:04:20] everybody can walk this way of holiness.
[1:04:23] When they get into the extremes of
[1:04:25] things and they get fanatical to things
[1:04:27] and they get cold in formal things and
[1:04:31] all of that, it separates them. They
[1:04:34] they can't walk this way of holiness
[1:04:36] because you got to stay balanced.
[1:04:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:43] &gt;&gt; Now, the way of holiness was established
[1:04:45] at Calvary.
[1:04:47] Amen. And it was at Calvary that Satan
[1:04:51] broke the powers of Satan. Do you
[1:04:54] believe that?
[1:04:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:57] &gt;&gt; And and and the prophet says, "See, he
[1:05:00] opened Christ opened the prison doors of
[1:05:03] hell to every man that was shut up in
[1:05:06] this earth in the prisons, fearing what
[1:05:10] death would be to him when he died. But
[1:05:13] Christ opened those cell doors and let
[1:05:16] every captive free.
[1:05:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:19] &gt;&gt; You don't have to no longer yield your
[1:05:21] members to sin.
[1:05:24] &gt;&gt; And I say this, you don't have to wreck
[1:05:26] up in your Christian walk.
[1:05:29] &gt;&gt; You don't have to backslide. I know the
[1:05:31] prophet said we backslide every day and
[1:05:33] we have to repent every day. That's not
[1:05:35] what I'm talking about. You don't have
[1:05:37] to get so cold and dead and and backslid
[1:05:41] to where you don't know what the spirit
[1:05:42] of God is anymore.
[1:05:45] &gt;&gt; You don't have to do that. You don't
[1:05:46] have to get to drinking and smoking and
[1:05:49] telling lies and gambling and and all of
[1:05:53] these things. Why? Because God made a
[1:05:56] way that you can walk this highway or
[1:05:59] this way of holiness. Can you say amen?
[1:06:02] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:06:03] &gt;&gt; Come on. Before a man can enter that
[1:06:06] highway to start walking the way of
[1:06:09] holiness, amen, he first has to come to
[1:06:12] the fountain, amen, of blood.
[1:06:15] &gt;&gt; The fountain filled with blood and be
[1:06:17] cleansed. Can you say
[1:06:18] &gt;&gt; amen?
[1:06:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. So that's the beginning of of
[1:06:22] getting on the way of holiness and
[1:06:25] living a separated life. You know, the
[1:06:27] prophet tells us, you don't you don't
[1:06:29] have to be mean. You don't have to be
[1:06:31] snobby to people. You don't have to be
[1:06:34] arrogant and stuck up and and rude and
[1:06:38] act like we're better than somebody
[1:06:40] else.
[1:06:41] &gt;&gt; But here's what a prophet says. He says
[1:06:43] we're to live a life of genuine holiness
[1:06:49] that the fruits of the spirit might be
[1:06:51] seen in us.
[1:06:53] &gt;&gt; Can't be seen in just a regular church
[1:06:56] member.
[1:06:57] &gt;&gt; It ain't going to be found in the world
[1:06:59] of things. It's going to be found in
[1:07:02] somebody that's walking in that way of
[1:07:04] holiness.
[1:07:06] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? That the fruits of the
[1:07:09] spirit may be seen in us of meekness and
[1:07:13] gentleness and patience and
[1:07:15] longsuffering and faith. See, it's the
[1:07:19] fruits of the spirit.
[1:07:20] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? Amen. You can be kind
[1:07:23] to people and and friendly to people and
[1:07:26] yet keep your garments undefiled.
[1:07:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:32] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Not get confused when
[1:07:35] you're on the job or at school or at the
[1:07:38] grocery store and confused of who you
[1:07:41] are
[1:07:42] &gt;&gt; and ashamed of who you are. I am the
[1:07:46] bride of Christ
[1:07:49] &gt;&gt; and I ain't going to defile myself with
[1:07:51] this world.
[1:07:52] &gt;&gt; Let them do what they want to do and
[1:07:54] I'll be kind to them and I'll reach out
[1:07:57] to them and try to pull them in. But as
[1:08:00] far as for me in my house, I'm going to
[1:08:03] serve the Lord.
[1:08:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:08] Even though real holiness starts
[1:08:12] within the heart of man as it does,
[1:08:16] men we have found have tried to
[1:08:22] start with holiness on the outside.
[1:08:26] Just like brother Brandham talked about,
[1:08:28] you know, some women can have their long
[1:08:30] hair and steal a temper as as a buzzaw.
[1:08:33] you know, fighting.
[1:08:35] Well, see, they they trying to start it
[1:08:38] from the outside, but holiness actually
[1:08:41] is an inward work.
[1:08:43] &gt;&gt; It starts in the heart of man.
[1:08:46] &gt;&gt; It separates us. That's where the
[1:08:47] separation starts is in the in the heart
[1:08:50] of man.
[1:08:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. It takes the desires away. It
[1:08:54] takes the wantto's away. It takes all of
[1:08:57] the the carnal uh things that we're that
[1:09:00] that will come against the word. It
[1:09:02] takes it all away to where that we can
[1:09:05] come into agreement with that word.
[1:09:08] Ain't that right? But then
[1:09:11] it has an outward manifestation.
[1:09:15] &gt;&gt; You believe that
[1:09:16] &gt;&gt; holiness has an out man an outward
[1:09:19] manifestation. It does matter. And I
[1:09:22] want to say to you young people, it
[1:09:25] matters how we dress.
[1:09:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. And I say to us all, it matters
[1:09:30] how we conduct ourselves.
[1:09:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:33] &gt;&gt; It matters what we listen to and what we
[1:09:36] watch.
[1:09:38] &gt;&gt; It matters what we talk about.
[1:09:41] &gt;&gt; It matters uh the places we go.
[1:09:46] &gt;&gt; It matters. Can you say amen?
[1:09:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:49] &gt;&gt; See, and and it it matters to God
[1:09:53] and it should also matter to us as
[1:09:56] believers.
[1:09:58] Ain't that right?
[1:10:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. Matthew 5:16, Jesus says, "Let
[1:10:04] your light so shine before men that they
[1:10:08] may see your good works." They may not
[1:10:12] see what's in your heart, but they'll
[1:10:14] see, amen, your good works. By your good
[1:10:18] works, then they know, amen, that what
[1:10:21] is in your heart.
[1:10:23] &gt;&gt; That's right. So let your light so shine
[1:10:25] before men that they may see your good
[1:10:28] works and to glorify not you.
[1:10:33] &gt;&gt; We're not doing this for us to be seen.
[1:10:36] &gt;&gt; We're we're not manifesting works for
[1:10:38] for for the the sake of the church.
[1:10:42] &gt;&gt; We're doing it that our glorified
[1:10:47] &gt;&gt; by those that see our works.
[1:10:50] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? How many wants God to
[1:10:52] be glorified?
[1:10:54] &gt;&gt; I want God to be seen. Amen. And that
[1:10:58] men may glorify him.
[1:11:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:04] &gt;&gt; Now, we are not to be men pleasers
[1:11:08] or slaves to people's opinions and
[1:11:10] ideas.
[1:11:12] &gt;&gt; You know, people try to mold us into
[1:11:15] what they think we should be and what
[1:11:17] they think we should do.
[1:11:20] Most of the time it's out of out of line
[1:11:23] with biblical teaching.
[1:11:26] &gt;&gt; But God wants us to stay with his word.
[1:11:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:30] &gt;&gt; Which goes back to the message of the
[1:11:32] hour. Can you say amen?
[1:11:35] &gt;&gt; So then the light that we are to shine
[1:11:39] is to be scriptural light.
[1:11:43] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:11:44] That's the only light there is
[1:11:47] is scriptural light.
[1:11:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:51] &gt;&gt; Outside of light, there's darkness.
[1:11:54] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[1:11:56] &gt;&gt; So this is how the father is glorified.
[1:11:59] Not when I do a good deed. Not when I do
[1:12:02] something that the world thinks I should
[1:12:04] do,
[1:12:05] &gt;&gt; but when my light has become a
[1:12:08] scriptural light.
[1:12:10] and they see that I'm in obedience with
[1:12:13] the scriptures.
[1:12:15] They see that that that I'm walking
[1:12:18] according to what God has desired for
[1:12:20] this age.
[1:12:23] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:12:25] &gt;&gt; Now, the Bible shows us that what we do
[1:12:28] outwardly is important because it's the
[1:12:31] only way that the people can see what we
[1:12:34] are. You take take Abraham for an
[1:12:37] example. Paul tells us that Abraham, he
[1:12:41] was justified by faith.
[1:12:44] James tells us he was justified by
[1:12:46] works.
[1:12:48] &gt;&gt; And so it it it it looks like there's a
[1:12:51] contradiction between the two men and
[1:12:54] what they've written. And you know, I
[1:12:57] I've actually had, you know, um
[1:13:02] um a brother, you know, um back years
[1:13:06] ago uh preach on this and said there's a
[1:13:08] contradiction there, but there's not a
[1:13:11] contradiction.
[1:13:13] &gt;&gt; And I thank God for a prophet that would
[1:13:15] show us what it's all about.
[1:13:18] &gt;&gt; Take the contradictions away that we
[1:13:21] could understand these. Can you say
[1:13:22] amen? And so Paul when he's saying that
[1:13:26] Abraham was justifed by uh justified by
[1:13:30] his faith he was saying that's what God
[1:13:32] justified him by
[1:13:34] &gt;&gt; faith. Amen. Uh the faith of Abraham.
[1:13:38] When James is saying that Abraham was
[1:13:41] justified by his works, he's saying
[1:13:43] that's what man justified him by.
[1:13:47] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:13:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's one thing to say I have
[1:13:50] faith. I believe. Amen. And it's another
[1:13:53] thing to act upon that faith. It's one
[1:13:56] thing to love God and say, "I love God
[1:13:59] and Jesus is my Lord." It's another
[1:14:02] thing to show forth them works
[1:14:05] &gt;&gt; to prove it. Can you say amen? Now, the
[1:14:08] Bible says that God looks upon the
[1:14:10] heart. And of course, if you talk to
[1:14:12] anybody out, especially when you're look
[1:14:14] talking of of dress codes and things
[1:14:17] like that, this scripture is the most
[1:14:20] often used and in misinterpreted,
[1:14:24] &gt;&gt; you know, cuz it Well, God loves me just
[1:14:26] the way I am. He looks upon the heart,
[1:14:29] &gt;&gt; ain't that right?
[1:14:31] &gt;&gt; And that's true. He does look upon the
[1:14:33] heart, but man can't see your heart.
[1:14:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:39] Hello.
[1:14:41] &gt;&gt; He can't see what's in your heart, but
[1:14:44] he can see the manifestation
[1:14:48] &gt;&gt; of what's in your heart.
[1:14:51] &gt;&gt; You can't hold things in your heart and
[1:14:53] not it manifest.
[1:14:55] &gt;&gt; You hold bitterness in your heart, it's
[1:14:57] going to manifest somewhere.
[1:14:59] &gt;&gt; You'll start talking about somebody,
[1:15:01] you're going to start dealing with it.
[1:15:03] You'll you'll you'll skirt around them.
[1:15:04] you when his the name's mentioned, all
[1:15:07] of a sudden there's just something rises
[1:15:08] up and and you want to you you just want
[1:15:11] to spew it out
[1:15:13] &gt;&gt; because there's a bitterness there.
[1:15:15] Well, when when there's a love, you
[1:15:17] know, uh uh you you you love somebody
[1:15:20] and you know, you love your wife and you
[1:15:22] love your husband and and and you you
[1:15:25] you you can't just, you know, go go
[1:15:28] without showing some affection
[1:15:30] somewhere.
[1:15:32] &gt;&gt; You want to be with them.
[1:15:35] You you you want to let him know just
[1:15:37] how much you love her,
[1:15:40] &gt;&gt; how much you love him.
[1:15:42] Can you say amen? There there's a
[1:15:44] manifestation somewhere because it's
[1:15:47] what's in your heart.
[1:15:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:50] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[1:15:52] &gt;&gt; Well, if God's in our hearts, Amen. We
[1:15:54] can't wait for the church doors to open.
[1:15:57] God's in our hearts. We we just can't we
[1:16:00] we can't just sit there without some
[1:16:03] emotion or expression
[1:16:08] &gt;&gt; of what God has done for us.
[1:16:10] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:16:13] &gt;&gt; See, so God made it to where that
[1:16:15] whatever is in a man's heart, he will
[1:16:17] manifest it by his works. So then if we
[1:16:21] believe God's word then our works will
[1:16:24] declare that to be true.
[1:16:28] &gt;&gt; If if God is in our heart then our works
[1:16:31] will declare that to be true.
[1:16:35] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:16:36] &gt;&gt; If we love God then our works will
[1:16:40] declare that to be true
[1:16:43] &gt;&gt; because it's down in our hearts.
[1:16:46] &gt;&gt; Now God hates sin.
[1:16:51] And our works manifest that. If God is
[1:16:54] in our heart, that God hates sin.
[1:16:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:58] &gt;&gt; And so if he's in our hearts, then our
[1:17:02] works manifested by doing what Paul
[1:17:05] said, abstain from the appearance of
[1:17:07] sin.
[1:17:09] &gt;&gt; Right? So when we abstain from sin, when
[1:17:12] we abstain from things that are defiled
[1:17:15] and against God's word and and all of
[1:17:18] these things, then it's a it's a proof.
[1:17:22] It's something that is showing there's
[1:17:25] something holy down in our hearts.
[1:17:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:30] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:17:32] &gt;&gt; This allows the people to see the
[1:17:34] holiness of God through us.
[1:17:37] See, we're reflectors. How many believes
[1:17:39] that
[1:17:40] &gt;&gt; God is love and God in our heart we
[1:17:43] reflect love. We reflect his love to
[1:17:46] others. God is holy. We reflect his
[1:17:49] holiness to others. God is gentle. We
[1:17:53] reflect his gentleness to others. God is
[1:17:56] the God of peace. We reflect his peace
[1:17:58] to others.
[1:18:00] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that?
[1:18:02] See, and and and so this is why that God
[1:18:05] called us and separated us from the
[1:18:08] world that he could express himself.
[1:18:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. The purpose of Jesus coming to the
[1:18:15] earth was to show God.
[1:18:18] &gt;&gt; It's what the prophet said.
[1:18:19] &gt;&gt; That's why he come to this earth is to
[1:18:21] show God. Amen. And and for he was God.
[1:18:25] And he uh John 3:16, for God so loved
[1:18:28] the world that he gave his only begotten
[1:18:31] son that whosoever believes in him
[1:18:33] should not perish but have everlasting
[1:18:35] life. Ain't that right? So he come as
[1:18:38] the expression of God's love.
[1:18:41] &gt;&gt; God himself had to express his love
[1:18:46] &gt;&gt; and he expressed it through his son.
[1:18:49] &gt;&gt; Sent his son to express that love.
[1:18:52] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[1:18:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. See, so the Son was the body that
[1:18:56] God dwelt in. Uh uh John 14:10,
[1:19:01] "Believest thou not that I am in the
[1:19:03] Father, and the Father in me?" Jesus
[1:19:04] says, "The words that I speak unto you,
[1:19:07] I speak not of myself, but the Father
[1:19:09] that dwelleth in me, he doeth the
[1:19:11] works."
[1:19:12] &gt;&gt; Now, Jesus was very well aware of the
[1:19:16] role that he was to play upon the earth.
[1:19:20] &gt;&gt; He knew that he was sent for a purpose.
[1:19:23] He identified himself in the scriptures.
[1:19:27] He did not identify himself as Moses
[1:19:30] trying to take Moses' spot or rebuild
[1:19:32] Moses's ministry or whatever. He
[1:19:36] identified that Moses spoke of him
[1:19:40] &gt;&gt; and and and so he found his place and he
[1:19:43] knew that he was a witness of God.
[1:19:47] &gt;&gt; The prophet said that that Jesus was a
[1:19:50] witness of God. anybody. The church
[1:19:52] couldn't be a witness of God. They were
[1:19:54] being a witness of themselves
[1:19:57] &gt;&gt; and and man's ideas and man's creed.
[1:20:00] They had drifted so far off the beaten
[1:20:02] path that they no longer become a
[1:20:05] reflection of God.
[1:20:07] &gt;&gt; That God sent his son to the world.
[1:20:10] Amen. And and he would he would play a
[1:20:13] role to where God could be manifested
[1:20:18] through him. Amen.
[1:20:23] &gt;&gt; He was to do the will of God.
[1:20:26] He had to sub subject his own will to do
[1:20:30] that.
[1:20:31] He had to surrender himself to the
[1:20:33] father's will. How many believes that?
[1:20:38] &gt;&gt; We know that Satan tried to get him to
[1:20:40] do something outside of the will of God,
[1:20:43] outside of what was written of him in
[1:20:45] the word. tried to get him to do
[1:20:48] something outside, but Christ was
[1:20:50] disciplined
[1:20:52] &gt;&gt; to the father's will.
[1:20:55] &gt;&gt; Satan was able to get everybody else in
[1:20:57] that in that day, but he couldn't get
[1:20:59] him.
[1:21:02] &gt;&gt; He lived a separated life to where the
[1:21:06] influence of Satan couldn't get to him.
[1:21:10] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[1:21:12] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:21:15] How, you know, how how could the people
[1:21:18] know that God was among them if if Jesus
[1:21:21] went about doing his own will,
[1:21:24] &gt;&gt; doing about what he wanted to do, being
[1:21:27] just uh what we what would call
[1:21:29] freelancers,
[1:21:30] &gt;&gt; just just just doing anything that he
[1:21:33] wants to do and and h how could they
[1:21:35] know the power of God if the father
[1:21:37] couldn't work his will in him?
[1:21:41] See, the father wouldn't been able to
[1:21:43] vindicate him. The father wouldn't been
[1:21:45] able to set his approval on him if Jesus
[1:21:49] was constantly ignoring the word and and
[1:21:52] and ignoring his position and and and
[1:21:55] just wanting to do everything else. And
[1:21:58] we know he had to struggle with that.
[1:22:01] &gt;&gt; Yes, he did.
[1:22:01] &gt;&gt; For he was tempted in all points as we
[1:22:03] are. It was at Calvary at at Gold Gulf
[1:22:07] or or or the Garden of Gethsemane that
[1:22:10] he said, "Let uh let let this cut pass
[1:22:13] from me if it be thy will."
[1:22:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:17] &gt;&gt; Sure.
[1:22:17] &gt;&gt; That's what he did.
[1:22:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:21] &gt;&gt; If he was too busy trying to make
[1:22:23] friends with people or trying to please
[1:22:25] people,
[1:22:27] then he wouldn't have been able to show
[1:22:28] God to them.
[1:22:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:31] &gt;&gt; So, he loved people. He wanted to help
[1:22:34] people, but he realized he was there for
[1:22:37] a purpose.
[1:22:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:40] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:22:41] &gt;&gt; His his help to people was far greater
[1:22:46] than than than than the church
[1:22:48] organizations
[1:22:50] uh uh feeding the poor.
[1:22:53] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:22:53] &gt;&gt; His help. Can you say amen? We can feed
[1:22:56] the poor, but ain't going to set their
[1:22:58] soul free.
[1:22:59] We we can build hospitals, but it ain't
[1:23:02] going to do what we what needs to be
[1:23:04] done.
[1:23:06] &gt;&gt; So Jesus knew that he came to show God
[1:23:10] to the people.
[1:23:12] &gt;&gt; Yes, you did.
[1:23:16] &gt;&gt; Now, Brother Brandaman speaking to the
[1:23:18] people said, "You got so much world on
[1:23:20] you that God can't reflect himself
[1:23:23] through you."
[1:23:24] See, the church wanting to be more like
[1:23:26] the world. the church wanting to be more
[1:23:28] more uh immersed with the world things
[1:23:31] to blend in and they say to try to help.
[1:23:35] &gt;&gt; They say we're showing more compassion.
[1:23:38] They say we're doing a greater work.
[1:23:40] Amen. By blending in. We got pastors now
[1:23:43] that you know and and not in the
[1:23:45] message. I hope not. Amen. But but they
[1:23:48] they they come out in jeans and they'll
[1:23:50] have hoes and in their pants and the
[1:23:53] shirt out of their pants and and wacky
[1:23:56] hair do all in the name of trying to
[1:23:58] help people.
[1:24:00] &gt;&gt; Trying to blend in with the people. You
[1:24:03] understand what I'm saying?
[1:24:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. And and it's getting so
[1:24:06] far-fetched that they're blending in and
[1:24:09] they forget that holiness is a separated
[1:24:12] life. Christianity is a way of holiness,
[1:24:16] &gt;&gt; walking pleasing to God.
[1:24:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:21] &gt;&gt; You believe that?
[1:24:22] &gt;&gt; So he said you got so much world on you
[1:24:24] that God can't reflect himself through
[1:24:26] you.
[1:24:27] &gt;&gt; So see Jesus could not take on the
[1:24:30] habits of the world. Amen. And and and
[1:24:33] conform to the church organizations
[1:24:36] and and still reflect the father. He had
[1:24:39] to stay in his position.
[1:24:42] Yes, you do.
[1:24:43] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:24:44] &gt;&gt; He had to stay in his position.
[1:24:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:50] &gt;&gt; He was despised and rejected because of
[1:24:53] it.
[1:24:55] &gt;&gt; He was mocked and scorned, spat upon. He
[1:24:59] suffered pain and heartache.
[1:25:03] All these things. But did you notice we
[1:25:07] as the as the elect of God benefited
[1:25:10] from it,
[1:25:12] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:25:13] &gt;&gt; We benefited from it. He stayed in his
[1:25:15] position and we benefited.
[1:25:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:18] &gt;&gt; Do you understand that when you stay in
[1:25:20] your position, people benefit from it?
[1:25:23] &gt;&gt; True.
[1:25:24] &gt;&gt; When a man will stay in his position in
[1:25:27] in in in the role that he has to play
[1:25:29] within a marriage, within his family,
[1:25:32] &gt;&gt; his family benefits from that.
[1:25:33] Absolutely.
[1:25:35] &gt;&gt; When a wife will stay in her position
[1:25:38] and mother stays in her position, the
[1:25:41] family benefits from it.
[1:25:43] &gt;&gt; The husband benefits, the children
[1:25:44] benefit.
[1:25:46] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[1:25:48] &gt;&gt; See, when we stay in our position, Jesus
[1:25:51] stayed in his position.
[1:25:53] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:25:54] &gt;&gt; He did.
[1:25:55] &gt;&gt; He knew what God had called him to do,
[1:25:57] and he stayed right in the middle of the
[1:25:59] road with it.
[1:26:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:03] And because of it, look where we're
[1:26:05] headed.
[1:26:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:26:09] &gt;&gt; We benefited from it. Paul speaks of
[1:26:11] Christ saying, "Though he was rich, yet
[1:26:14] for your sakes he became poor that ye
[1:26:17] through his poverty might be rich."
[1:26:20] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[1:26:21] &gt;&gt; So he stayed true to what God called him
[1:26:23] to do for our sakes. He suffered because
[1:26:28] he didn't compromise. He was rejected
[1:26:31] because he wouldn't go with the popular
[1:26:33] trend.
[1:26:35] &gt;&gt; He felt the loneliness because he didn't
[1:26:37] forsake the call upon his life.
[1:26:41] &gt;&gt; But I benefited.
[1:26:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:26:44] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:26:47] &gt;&gt; According to Ephesians 1:23, the church
[1:26:50] is his body. How many believes that?
[1:26:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:53] &gt;&gt; We are the church, right? Yes,
[1:26:55] &gt;&gt; we become part of his church not because
[1:26:57] we go to Faith Tabernacle or some other
[1:26:59] church,
[1:27:00] &gt;&gt; but because we are born of the spirit.
[1:27:03] &gt;&gt; For by one spirit are we all baptized
[1:27:06] into one body.
[1:27:07] &gt;&gt; This church, Paul says, is the fullness
[1:27:10] of Christ.
[1:27:12] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? That fullness of him
[1:27:15] that filleth all in all. So notice what
[1:27:18] in John and I hope this all right this
[1:27:21] morning
[1:27:22] &gt;&gt; but John 15:5 Jesus speaks to the church
[1:27:25] saying I am the vine you are the
[1:27:27] branches. He that abideth in me and I in
[1:27:31] him the same bringeth forth much fruit
[1:27:34] for without me you can do nothing. Ain't
[1:27:36] that right?
[1:27:37] &gt;&gt; So then what is it? The vine produces
[1:27:40] the life the prophet said and the
[1:27:42] branches bear the fruit. Yeah.
[1:27:45] &gt;&gt; So notice what the prophet said. We are
[1:27:47] his hands on earth. How many believes
[1:27:49] that?
[1:27:50] &gt;&gt; We are his hands upon this earth. We are
[1:27:53] his feet upon this earth. We are his
[1:27:56] mouth upon this earth. We are his eyes.
[1:27:58] We are we are his body. We are his
[1:28:02] gospel on earth. And the gospel is not
[1:28:06] all together by word. The word made
[1:28:10] manifest. Everybody say the word made
[1:28:12] manifest
[1:28:14] &gt;&gt; is the gospel and we are his gospel.
[1:28:19] &gt;&gt; We are that word made manifest. Not
[1:28:23] manifesting the thoughts of what the
[1:28:24] world thinks.
[1:28:26] &gt;&gt; Let him ridicule us. Let him despise us.
[1:28:30] But let us maintain the purpose
[1:28:33] &gt;&gt; that we are called to. And that is to be
[1:28:36] his body, his gospel, the word made
[1:28:40] flesh.
[1:28:41] &gt;&gt; Somebody's going to benefit from it.
[1:28:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:48] &gt;&gt; So he's in order for this to happen,
[1:28:51] notice
[1:28:53] God, the prophet said God takes the
[1:28:55] person and begins to mold himself into
[1:28:57] that person. And a lot of times we
[1:29:00] think, oh, him molding himself into us,
[1:29:02] that's awesome.
[1:29:04] A lot of times that hurts.
[1:29:07] A lot of time there's a cutting away of
[1:29:09] our desires and our flesh and killing
[1:29:11] out and oh, a lot of times we're crying
[1:29:14] and we're boohooing and asking why do
[1:29:17] this have to happen and why do this have
[1:29:19] to happen and and oh my and it seemed
[1:29:22] like our world is turned upside down.
[1:29:24] But he's molding himself. Amen.
[1:29:31] &gt;&gt; See, make his hands do what God would
[1:29:34] have hands to do. Make his lips speak
[1:29:37] what God's lips would speak because
[1:29:40] they're not his. They're God's.
[1:29:43] &gt;&gt; God begins to build a character, begins
[1:29:46] to take this weakness, our weaknesses,
[1:29:49] and to make his own self.
[1:29:53] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:29:54] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:29:54] &gt;&gt; Yes. make his own self.
[1:29:58] &gt;&gt; I don't know.
[1:30:00] I don't know about you, but there's a
[1:30:01] lot of things I live with with regrets
[1:30:03] and I think, "Oh, God, why did it have
[1:30:05] to happen that way? Why couldn't I have
[1:30:07] done this and why couldn't I have done
[1:30:08] this?" But see, God takes our weaknesses
[1:30:12] &gt;&gt; and he begins to mold himself,
[1:30:15] molds his character. Can you say amen?
[1:30:19] &gt;&gt; Now, and I hope this is making a little
[1:30:21] sense to you today.
[1:30:23] At the time of the first Exodus in the
[1:30:25] Bible, God commanded that Israel put
[1:30:28] blood upon the door
[1:30:31] uh post of their house.
[1:30:34] Why? It was going to separate them.
[1:30:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:38] &gt;&gt; That blood would be the separation from
[1:30:40] all other homes,
[1:30:43] right?
[1:30:44] &gt;&gt; God looking for something to separate
[1:30:46] them.
[1:30:47] &gt;&gt; Yes. So he says the only way that this
[1:30:50] will separate you from all these others
[1:30:53] is the blood,
[1:30:55] &gt;&gt; the token.
[1:30:56] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[1:30:58] &gt;&gt; So he commanded them to take and kill a
[1:31:02] lamb and then put that blood
[1:31:05] amen uh uh on their home for it would be
[1:31:08] a token that the lamb had died in their
[1:31:12] place.
[1:31:14] That way when the death angel come, he
[1:31:17] would know that there was a difference
[1:31:19] between this home and that home
[1:31:23] &gt;&gt; cuz he was coming to strike death in a
[1:31:25] home.
[1:31:27] &gt;&gt; And there had to be a separation.
[1:31:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:30] &gt;&gt; If there wasn't a separation, he would
[1:31:32] strike every home. He would strike
[1:31:35] everything in the land. that God would
[1:31:38] tell his people now make sure there's a
[1:31:40] separation
[1:31:42] &gt;&gt; because it doesn't matter what church
[1:31:43] you go to. It doesn't matter if you're
[1:31:45] circumcised. It doesn't matter, you
[1:31:48] know, if if you are of the lineage of
[1:31:50] Reuben or of Joseph or of Abraham or
[1:31:53] whatever. There had to be a token for
[1:31:56] separation.
[1:31:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:02] &gt;&gt; And the token had to be on display.
[1:32:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. Right?
[1:32:07] &gt;&gt; The lamb was on inside the house.
[1:32:10] &gt;&gt; We got Jesus on the inside of our
[1:32:13] hearts,
[1:32:15] &gt;&gt; but there had to be a display.
[1:32:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:18] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? And so, uh, it had to
[1:32:22] be on display. And brother Bram said,
[1:32:24] "Christianity has to display its token
[1:32:27] publicly
[1:32:28] &gt;&gt; in public life
[1:32:30] &gt;&gt; at the office, on the streets."
[1:32:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:34] &gt;&gt; At the store. Amen.
[1:32:35] &gt;&gt; When trouble is around,
[1:32:38] &gt;&gt; when you're in the valley or when you're
[1:32:40] on the mountaintop,
[1:32:42] &gt;&gt; the token's got to be displayed.
[1:32:45] &gt;&gt; There's got to be a difference.
[1:32:47] &gt;&gt; We all go through trials,
[1:32:50] but let the token be the difference.
[1:32:52] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:32:54] &gt;&gt; We all go through our troubles. We all
[1:32:56] fight things. But the difference is
[1:32:58] there's a token displayed
[1:33:04] &gt;&gt; when trouble is around anything in the
[1:33:06] church or everywhere else. He said see a
[1:33:09] man or a woman uh who is filled with the
[1:33:12] Holy Ghost. He is sealed away and
[1:33:15] secured from all harm and danger. His
[1:33:18] whole life displays what he is. Wherever
[1:33:21] he walks, whatever business he does,
[1:33:25] whoever he talks with, when he comes in
[1:33:28] contact with women, when he comes in
[1:33:31] contact with associates, when he comes
[1:33:33] in contact with everything, that token
[1:33:36] is laying there.
[1:33:40] &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad for the token?
[1:33:42] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Because that's the only thing
[1:33:44] that's the difference
[1:33:46] &gt;&gt; is the token. Amen.
[1:33:49] The token doesn't show that you're a
[1:33:52] Baptist. It doesn't show that you're a
[1:33:54] good Pentecostal
[1:33:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:56] &gt;&gt; It doesn't even show you're a good
[1:33:58] message
[1:34:00] &gt;&gt; guy.
[1:34:02] It It doesn't show that you're a
[1:34:04] apostolic or whatever else. You know
[1:34:06] what the token does? It shows that
[1:34:08] you're redeemed.
[1:34:12] &gt;&gt; It shows you're going somewhere and it
[1:34:14] ain't the tribulation.
[1:34:17] It shows it's separating you. I know
[1:34:19] everybody's calling themselves
[1:34:21] Christians, but there's a token that's
[1:34:24] showing a difference.
[1:34:25] &gt;&gt; I know everybody's saying we're on our
[1:34:27] way to heaven. I don't care. They can
[1:34:29] sing rock and roll and country and and
[1:34:31] and and and blaspheme God and be a
[1:34:35] reverend in the churches and all that.
[1:34:37] But the token makes the difference.
[1:34:41] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:34:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. token makes the difference is
[1:34:44] who's going to set up that marriage
[1:34:46] supper.
[1:34:48] &gt;&gt; So God brought a separation in this day.
[1:34:52] &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad you've been separated?
[1:34:55] &gt;&gt; Not because I'm smarter, but a token God
[1:34:57] gave.
[1:34:58] &gt;&gt; Not because of my goodwill. I have
[1:35:01] fallen so many time. But there is a
[1:35:03] token
[1:35:05] &gt;&gt; that shows the difference.
[1:35:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:09] &gt;&gt; That's right. The token shows that
[1:35:11] you're in a place of safety.
[1:35:14] Death is striking the land and we know
[1:35:16] it. Spiritual death is striking.
[1:35:20] &gt;&gt; It's true.
[1:35:21] &gt;&gt; People are becoming more dead and cold
[1:35:24] and backslid and formal and indifferent
[1:35:27] to the things of God and yet sitting in
[1:35:29] the pews.
[1:35:30] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[1:35:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. But the token separates us from
[1:35:34] that. Yes, we may fall. Yes, we may get
[1:35:37] discouraged. Yes, we go through our
[1:35:39] trials. Yes, we go through things that
[1:35:41] it just looks like we ain't going to
[1:35:43] make it. But there's a token that makes
[1:35:44] the difference.
[1:35:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:49] &gt;&gt; It shows that I'm in a place of safety.
[1:35:51] Satan can't touch me.
[1:35:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:55] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[1:35:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:59] Now, by the token being on display,
[1:36:02] you're showing to the outside world, to
[1:36:04] the people, to the sinners, to the the
[1:36:06] unbelievers and make believers, to
[1:36:09] everybody that you're associated with.
[1:36:12] You're showing to them where the life
[1:36:15] truly is.
[1:36:19] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:36:21] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[1:36:22] &gt;&gt; yes, sir. See,
[1:36:24] I think we ought to care for one another
[1:36:28] enough to show them where the place of
[1:36:30] safety is.
[1:36:32] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[1:36:33] &gt;&gt; I think we ought to love the sitter so
[1:36:35] much
[1:36:37] to that we can show him where he can get
[1:36:41] under a token.
[1:36:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:44] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[1:36:46] &gt;&gt; Not to blend in
[1:36:48] for a token won't let you blend in.
[1:36:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. The token keeps you separated.
[1:36:54] &gt;&gt; But somebody needs to see the token.
[1:36:57] &gt;&gt; Somebody needs to see that there is
[1:36:59] something that separates.
[1:37:02] &gt;&gt; It can separate them from the judgment.
[1:37:05] It can separate them from their sins.
[1:37:09] You see, there are people who will not
[1:37:12] read the Bible.
[1:37:14] Therefore, we are the only Bible that
[1:37:16] people ever read. You know that. That's
[1:37:19] what a prophet said. People won't read
[1:37:21] the Bible. There's a lot of folks sad
[1:37:23] sadly won't read the Bible. There's a
[1:37:26] lot of people you come in contact that
[1:37:28] has never even opened that Bible up.
[1:37:30] Don't even know what the Bible means.
[1:37:31] But you are that Bible on display.
[1:37:35] &gt;&gt; That's right. People can't see heaven.
[1:37:39] Therefore, our life must reflect heaven
[1:37:42] to them.
[1:37:43] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? They can't see God.
[1:37:46] But our life must reflect God to them.
[1:37:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:55] &gt;&gt; It's not only important, and I won't
[1:37:57] keep you much longer, but it's not only
[1:37:59] important that we be holy as
[1:38:01] individuals,
[1:38:05] but our marriage should be holy.
[1:38:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:08] &gt;&gt; Our family should be holy.
[1:38:11] Our home should be holy.
[1:38:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:16] I wished I would have kept I had a quote
[1:38:18] and I didn't know whether to use it or
[1:38:20] not. But if you go back, brother
[1:38:22] Brandman said we should never talking
[1:38:24] about us men, we should never
[1:38:28] treat our wives in a filthy way.
[1:38:32] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:38:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:35] Even though they're our wives,
[1:38:38] we should never bring them under what
[1:38:40] the world is doing
[1:38:42] &gt;&gt; in filthy ways in our home.
[1:38:46] They are our sisters.
[1:38:48] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:38:48] &gt;&gt; Prophet said, "Your wife is your sister.
[1:38:50] She's a daughter of God."
[1:38:54] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[1:38:56] &gt;&gt; See, it it it's got to be holy. It it
[1:38:59] matters. I want to say this. It matters
[1:39:01] what we have in our homes.
[1:39:04] That's right.
[1:39:05] &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, it's just a natural
[1:39:07] house that we dwell in. It matters to
[1:39:09] God."
[1:39:11] &gt;&gt; Cuz here, you know, if you're going to
[1:39:14] if you're going to apply the token
[1:39:16] house, it's going to matter.
[1:39:20] &gt;&gt; Prophet, you know what? What do we do
[1:39:21] when we apply the token to our house?
[1:39:23] The prophet says, "Move all the trash
[1:39:25] out."
[1:39:25] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:39:26] &gt;&gt; Have a house cleaning party. Men and
[1:39:28] women, kick out the shorts. Throw away
[1:39:30] the cigarettes. Move out the short
[1:39:33] skirts, the cards, the television. This
[1:39:36] is what his words are. And whatever
[1:39:38] more. Get all this old stuff out of the
[1:39:42] system here that's called the world. If
[1:39:45] you love the world or the things of the
[1:39:47] world is because the love of God is not
[1:39:49] even in you. all the dances, parties,
[1:39:53] rock and roll, old vulgar newspapers,
[1:39:56] and that that and the stuff that's of
[1:39:59] the world, kick it out the door and say,
[1:40:02] "We're cleaning out this place around
[1:40:04] here."
[1:40:06] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:40:08] &gt;&gt; All these love stories and romance and
[1:40:11] all of these things, kick it out.
[1:40:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:16] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:40:18] &gt;&gt; Why? We're applying a token.
[1:40:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:22] &gt;&gt; It matters what we have in our home.
[1:40:27] Brother Bram says, "Today, we've walked
[1:40:30] and rode. We've took our children to
[1:40:32] televisions and uncensored programs.
[1:40:36] We've let our floors and our tables
[1:40:39] become full of old, dirty, sexy love
[1:40:41] stories instead of the word of God.
[1:40:45] There isn't a kid in this city. But what
[1:40:47] knows more about Author Godfrey or Elvis
[1:40:50] Presley or Pat Boon or Davy Crockett
[1:40:53] than they do know about Jesus Christ?
[1:40:56] That's straight. But oh, it's true. No
[1:40:59] wonder there's a falling away.
[1:41:04] &gt;&gt; So the falling away starts in the home.
[1:41:07] &gt;&gt; I say it starts in the house, in the
[1:41:10] heart,
[1:41:11] &gt;&gt; and then it manifests itself in the
[1:41:13] home. When people start getting backslid
[1:41:16] in their heart and they start getting
[1:41:18] indifferent in their heart, then it
[1:41:20] starts manifesting in the home. They let
[1:41:23] loose here and they get latched here and
[1:41:24] they get lax there. That's why you
[1:41:26] cannot entertain any devil. You cannot
[1:41:30] entertain spirits. I don't care how
[1:41:33] discouraged you get, maintain your
[1:41:36] position.
[1:41:37] [Music]
[1:41:39] &gt;&gt; You've got to maintain it. That's right.
[1:41:42] &gt;&gt; You might get weary. You might get
[1:41:44] battle scarred. It does not matter.
[1:41:49] &gt;&gt; Stay under the token.
[1:41:52] &gt;&gt; Keep separated.
[1:41:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:57] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:41:59] &gt;&gt; What we bring into the home affects us.
[1:42:06] &gt;&gt; And the things of the world will cause
[1:42:08] us to lose our first love.
[1:42:13] Brother Brandham, he's talking and he's
[1:42:17] he's dealing in the Ephesian age, church
[1:42:19] age, the Phil, you know, and where God
[1:42:21] says, "You've left your first love." But
[1:42:24] I like how he as he's talking, God
[1:42:27] speaking, he's also bringing it out in
[1:42:29] our age,
[1:42:31] &gt;&gt; cuz we know he didn't have they didn't
[1:42:33] have a lot of those things that we have
[1:42:34] today. But he says, he says, "See,
[1:42:37] you've left grace and faith and power to
[1:42:40] swap it for labor and works." Well, I
[1:42:43] tell you, Brother Brandham, I help every
[1:42:45] widow woman I can. Well, that's a good
[1:42:47] thing. I commend you for that. But
[1:42:49] where's that first love you once had?
[1:42:52] Uh-huh. Where's that joy you used to
[1:42:55] have? As David once cried, "Oh Lord,
[1:42:57] restore to me the joy of my salvation.
[1:43:00] Where's them all night prayer meetings
[1:43:02] and tears on your cheek? My goodness,
[1:43:05] the Bible's even dusty. Got cobwebs on
[1:43:07] it. You read old love stories and news
[1:43:11] and things that oughten to even be
[1:43:14] allowed to be published and put for a
[1:43:17] trash can and we Pentecostal people pick
[1:43:20] them up and just loft over them like a
[1:43:24] bunch of flies on a garbage can.
[1:43:27] He said, "That's right. Oh mercy, what
[1:43:29] we need is is get back to our first
[1:43:32] love. Amen.
[1:43:36] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:43:40] &gt;&gt; Hey,
[1:43:42] the more you serve God, the longer you
[1:43:43] serve God, the more hurt you're going to
[1:43:45] get.
[1:43:47] &gt;&gt; The more we get close to one another,
[1:43:49] the more we're going to see our hinder
[1:43:50] parts.
[1:43:53] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[1:43:56] &gt;&gt; If I if I stayed away from Brother Amos,
[1:44:00] I'd say, "Oh, Brother Amos is a good
[1:44:01] man. That guy's an angel
[1:44:04] now. But and he may he'll say that to
[1:44:07] me, but the more we fellowship,
[1:44:12] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:44:13] &gt;&gt; He might say, man, he is a little
[1:44:15] different.
[1:44:17] And I'm like, wow, I don't know why he
[1:44:19] would have said that or why he done
[1:44:20] that, you know?
[1:44:22] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:44:23] &gt;&gt; But see what's happening? We're getting
[1:44:24] to know one another.
[1:44:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:27] And the more we get to know one another,
[1:44:29] we're not just knowing our good side,
[1:44:31] we're knowing the bad sides.
[1:44:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:36] &gt;&gt; Are you with me now?
[1:44:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:38] &gt;&gt; So then the thing, what's the next thing
[1:44:40] Satan going to do? Get us to dwell on
[1:44:42] the bad side of brother Amos or the bad
[1:44:44] side of Shawn Martin
[1:44:46] &gt;&gt; and then we just walk away and not
[1:44:47] fellowship. I'd rather I'd rather love
[1:44:49] him from afar. Well, that's not what
[1:44:51] brother Brandham said. That's not what
[1:44:53] the Bible says.
[1:44:55] Amen.
[1:44:56] &gt;&gt; We're not to love each other from afar
[1:44:59] to where we don't have to put up with
[1:45:00] one another. Rab said we got to put up
[1:45:02] with one another.
[1:45:04] &gt;&gt; Put up with our mistakes. Put up with
[1:45:06] our failures.
[1:45:07] &gt;&gt; Put up with our stupidities.
[1:45:11] &gt;&gt; Why? There's a token.
[1:45:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:17] &gt;&gt; I hope you understand.
[1:45:19] &gt;&gt; I'd rather put up with one of us. I hope
[1:45:22] you'd rather put up with me than put up
[1:45:23] with the world.
[1:45:24] &gt;&gt; I'd rather put up with you than put up
[1:45:26] with the world.
[1:45:27] &gt;&gt; I don't want the world.
[1:45:29] &gt;&gt; But I know this. There's a blood.
[1:45:32] &gt;&gt; And as long as there's a blood, God is
[1:45:35] not only covering me, he's covering
[1:45:36] Brother Amos.
[1:45:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:40] &gt;&gt; And if God doesn't see my mistakes, he
[1:45:42] doesn't see Brother Amos' mistakes. So
[1:45:45] let me walk under the blood. Let me
[1:45:46] fellowship under the blood. Amen.
[1:45:51] &gt;&gt; Keeps us separated from the world.
[1:45:54] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:45:57] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:45:59] &gt;&gt; So, we go back. The presence of God.
[1:46:03] You realize the presence of God comes to
[1:46:05] a home that's clean and sanctified.
[1:46:08] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:46:10] &gt;&gt; Now, Brother Brandon tells us why it's
[1:46:12] important to have our homes clean.
[1:46:14] &gt;&gt; Our home should be separated. Right.
[1:46:18] &gt;&gt; See, this is what the message does. It
[1:46:20] this doesn't deals with us here at
[1:46:21] church. It deals with us as individuals.
[1:46:24] It deals with us as fathers, as mothers,
[1:46:27] as children.
[1:46:28] &gt;&gt; It deals with us in our homes. How we
[1:46:31] treat one another, even in our family.
[1:46:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:35] &gt;&gt; And what we have in the secret things.
[1:46:39] Our homes are the most secret things.
[1:46:42] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:46:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:44] &gt;&gt; But God knows them.
[1:46:45] &gt;&gt; Yes, he does. So the presence of God
[1:46:48] comes into a home that's clean and
[1:46:50] sanctified. Brother Bram talked of
[1:46:51] Elizabeth in the New Testament. For
[1:46:54] years, and I want you to notice that for
[1:46:56] years, she couldn't have a child.
[1:47:00] I think I I read where brother Brown
[1:47:02] said at one place that Zacharias,
[1:47:04] Elizabeth's husband, was 70 and he might
[1:47:08] have said she was either 69 or something
[1:47:10] like that. But but years, I mean, think
[1:47:13] of this now. For years, she couldn't
[1:47:16] have a a child.
[1:47:19] But her her and her husband Zachcharias,
[1:47:23] the prophet said, were righteous, holy
[1:47:25] people, keeping the commandments of God,
[1:47:28] walking in all the statutes and
[1:47:30] ordinances of God, blameless.
[1:47:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:33] &gt;&gt; And he's not saying that they were
[1:47:35] sinless and didn't have faults. Surely,
[1:47:37] you understand.
[1:47:38] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:47:39] &gt;&gt; Another place he says, Elizabeth was
[1:47:42] barren. She hadn't had any children. She
[1:47:44] was past the age of barren. But now she
[1:47:48] had lived righteous and holy and clean
[1:47:51] before God all them years.
[1:47:53] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:47:54] &gt;&gt; Zachcharias all them years he was a
[1:47:57] priest before God officiating in the in
[1:48:01] the temple. Ain't that right?
[1:48:03] &gt;&gt; And and all them years now she's come to
[1:48:05] pass bearing a children of the age of
[1:48:09] barren. But he lived. Zachcharias lived
[1:48:12] right before God and believed on God and
[1:48:16] all of his great dark long hours and I
[1:48:20] would say years
[1:48:24] of worry finally the angel come
[1:48:28] &gt;&gt; and said God has answered your prayer
[1:48:31] &gt;&gt; he stayed in his position
[1:48:35] &gt;&gt; he did
[1:48:35] &gt;&gt; he would not compromise
[1:48:40] &gt;&gt; even though it seemed My God would never
[1:48:42] hear their prayer.
[1:48:45] But he stayed true to God.
[1:48:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:49] &gt;&gt; And finally, the angel came and said,
[1:48:53] "God has heard your prayer."
[1:48:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:55] &gt;&gt; He said, "Now, if you want God to hear
[1:48:57] your prayers and send an angel to your
[1:48:59] home, live right,
[1:49:01] &gt;&gt; do right.
[1:49:03] &gt;&gt; Treat everybody right. Be right before
[1:49:06] God, and God will grant that to you."
[1:49:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes sir.
[1:49:12] &gt;&gt; Oh, stay separated.
[1:49:15] &gt;&gt; That's good.
[1:49:17] &gt;&gt; So the angel of the Lord comes to homes
[1:49:20] where the occupants of that home are
[1:49:22] living true parents, husband, wife.
[1:49:29] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:49:32] &gt;&gt; You say, "Oh, I've made mistakes, so it
[1:49:34] just can't be." No. No. You get it under
[1:49:36] the blood.
[1:49:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:38] &gt;&gt; You understand what I'm saying? It's one
[1:49:39] thing I loved about, you know, u I I so
[1:49:42] appreciate about my parents is they made
[1:49:45] the home such a different home. I'd been
[1:49:48] into homes of my friends and I'd been
[1:49:50] out and, you know, with with worldly uh
[1:49:53] associates and and these things when I
[1:49:55] got older and things, but when I always
[1:49:58] come home,
[1:50:00] I knew that God was there.
[1:50:04] &gt;&gt; And it would always convict my heart.
[1:50:07] I said, ' God, I don't want that
[1:50:09] atmosphere out there. I I I I want this
[1:50:12] atmosphere that I'm feeling. Yes, dad
[1:50:14] had mistakes. Yes, mom made mistakes.
[1:50:17] Yes, they had their squables.
[1:50:22] &gt;&gt; But they were always quick to make
[1:50:24] things right and repent of them.
[1:50:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:31] When you look at it, Sarah and Abraham,
[1:50:34] the prophet said they lived upright
[1:50:36] before the Lord and kept all the
[1:50:38] statutes and all the commandments of the
[1:50:41] Lord. They lived in perfect obedience to
[1:50:43] the word in the light that they had.
[1:50:46] Think of that one.
[1:50:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:50:48] &gt;&gt; And the angel of the Lord visited them.
[1:50:53] &gt;&gt; He said, "If you want the angel of the
[1:50:55] Lord to come to your home, be like
[1:50:58] them." Amen.
[1:51:00] &gt;&gt; If you want angels to appear to you,
[1:51:02] keep your mind on God and off the things
[1:51:04] of the world. Do you understand that?
[1:51:07] &gt;&gt; I I'm going to close. I promise you. But
[1:51:09] no wonder we battle with things.
[1:51:12] &gt;&gt; No wonder because Satan is trying to get
[1:51:14] us off track.
[1:51:15] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:51:17] &gt;&gt; He'll try to get us to thinking about
[1:51:18] something that happened years ago.
[1:51:22] &gt;&gt; Or yesterday.
[1:51:24] He'll even try to get us to think about
[1:51:26] something that never happened yet. True.
[1:51:29] &gt;&gt; But we dwelling on these things and
[1:51:31] before you know it, we end up in
[1:51:33] depression. Our hearts begin heavy and
[1:51:36] and then we just start moping or we just
[1:51:38] start going through things and we just
[1:51:41] start entertaining things. And here's
[1:51:43] what a prophet is telling us. If you
[1:51:45] want angels to appear to you, keep your
[1:51:48] mind on God. Don't keep your mind on
[1:51:50] your troubles.
[1:51:52] &gt;&gt; Hello. Amen.
[1:51:53] &gt;&gt; Don't keep your mind on the
[1:51:54] circumstances or what's going around you
[1:51:56] and the impossibilities and all the
[1:51:58] troubles.
[1:52:00] &gt;&gt; Keep your mind on God.
[1:52:02] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:52:04] &gt;&gt; Keep it off the things of the world. Go
[1:52:06] about your business. Go to your church.
[1:52:08] Go to your washing of dishes. Whatever
[1:52:11] wherever you are, keep your mind on him
[1:52:13] all day and all night. Then God will do
[1:52:15] something. You're drawing close to him.
[1:52:18] You got the world shut out and it's just
[1:52:20] you and he together.
[1:52:23] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:52:23] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:52:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:25] &gt;&gt; This is why I think
[1:52:29] we as husbands,
[1:52:32] we should fear.
[1:52:34] Everybody say fear.
[1:52:36] &gt;&gt; Now that's a really a different word for
[1:52:40] guys. Fear. I'm not Joe.
[1:52:44] But this is a different fear. But we
[1:52:46] should fear our wife, our children
[1:52:52] enough
[1:52:53] to make sure our home is clean
[1:52:56] &gt;&gt; before the Lord.
[1:52:58] Sisters, you should fear your husband
[1:53:02] and your children.
[1:53:04] You see, we are responsible for
[1:53:06] spreading the light
[1:53:09] to the world, to our children, to our
[1:53:12] spouse.
[1:53:14] Right? Amen.
[1:53:16] &gt;&gt; Remember
[1:53:17] the Bible says of this age men shall be
[1:53:19] lovers of pleasure more than lovers of
[1:53:22] God
[1:53:23] &gt;&gt; and lovers of their own selves.
[1:53:26] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:53:29] So with this in mind and as we see this
[1:53:33] increasing lovers of pleasure more than
[1:53:35] lovers of God, lovers of their own self
[1:53:37] and yet the prophet says there's a lack
[1:53:39] of love and there will only be love
[1:53:41] found in the in the bride in the elect.
[1:53:45] So that means this type of love doesn't
[1:53:47] make us love ourselves. It doesn't make
[1:53:49] us want to love the pleasures of the
[1:53:51] world, but it makes us love God and love
[1:53:54] one another
[1:53:57] today. People don't want to be
[1:53:59] accountable to anyone.
[1:54:01] &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right.
[1:54:03] &gt;&gt; Have you noticed that
[1:54:05] that no one wants to be committed to
[1:54:07] anything or anyone because they don't
[1:54:10] want the obligation or responsibility?
[1:54:12] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:54:15] It's more easier just to live loose or
[1:54:18] to live by yourself or live in in a
[1:54:22] bubble to where you don't have no
[1:54:24] contact with other people because you
[1:54:26] don't want to deal with other people.
[1:54:30] &gt;&gt; And you want to be free to live your
[1:54:32] life, live how you want it, live the way
[1:54:34] you want it and all that without no one
[1:54:37] telling you how to do it, when to do it,
[1:54:39] where to do it. We don't want none of
[1:54:41] that.
[1:54:43] So people get married but but they don't
[1:54:45] want they don't want to that
[1:54:48] responsibility and obligation that comes
[1:54:50] with marriage.
[1:54:52] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:54:53] &gt;&gt; Then they have a family without
[1:54:55] accepting the responsibility that comes
[1:54:59] with having children.
[1:55:03] You you
[1:55:05] brothers that have have businesses.
[1:55:09] You know people want they'll come to you
[1:55:11] and want a job but they don't want to be
[1:55:13] committed.
[1:55:16] They don't want to be committed to
[1:55:18] authority. They don't want to be
[1:55:19] committed to hours.
[1:55:22] &gt;&gt; They don't want to be committed to work.
[1:55:24] &gt;&gt; But they want a job.
[1:55:28] &gt;&gt; Somehow the job is separate in their
[1:55:32] mind. The job is separate from all this
[1:55:34] other stuff.
[1:55:35] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:55:37] Then then they come to church and and
[1:55:38] and then they don't want to be held
[1:55:41] accountable to anything.
[1:55:43] They just want to come to church. Leave
[1:55:45] me alone.
[1:55:47] Just, you know,
[1:55:50] and and I I want to just be what I want
[1:55:52] to be when I want to be, how I want to
[1:55:54] be.
[1:55:55] &gt;&gt; But it just doesn't work that way.
[1:55:58] &gt;&gt; If you're going to get married, you're
[1:55:59] accountable to that. You you there's a
[1:56:01] responsibility that comes with that. if
[1:56:03] if if you're going to have children
[1:56:05] there, you know, when when I I learned
[1:56:08] that, you know, uh my first child was on
[1:56:12] the way, I I just was so scared to
[1:56:14] death. At first, I was scared to get
[1:56:16] married. I wanted to get married, but I
[1:56:17] scared to get married. Uh and then then,
[1:56:21] you know, when I I thought, "Oh man, how
[1:56:23] am I going to handle this now?"
[1:56:26] Because I realized there was a
[1:56:27] responsibility.
[1:56:30] Man, I've told you before even when you
[1:56:32] know my wife passed away, I I had five
[1:56:35] children.
[1:56:37] Seth, I think I'm been 11 years old and
[1:56:40] on down to Judah being four months. And
[1:56:44] I I remember I my world was torn apart.
[1:56:46] I I didn't know what to do. Didn't I was
[1:56:49] numb. And I just remember giving all my
[1:56:52] you know dropping the children off to my
[1:56:54] mother-in-law. She was saved at that
[1:56:56] time. And mom and dad was in in Arizona.
[1:56:59] So, I just dropped them off and I just
[1:57:02] took off. I didn't know what I was going
[1:57:04] to do, but I wanted to run. I wanted to
[1:57:06] get away. I I I just wanted to get away
[1:57:08] from it all.
[1:57:10] And then my mother I woke up the next
[1:57:12] day and my I noticed that I had gotten a
[1:57:16] bunch of calls from my mother-in-law and
[1:57:19] missed them and but I called her and she
[1:57:21] says, "You know, Sean, your children
[1:57:23] want you so bad they're crying." And I
[1:57:26] thought, "Oh, God."
[1:57:28] I got so caught up in my own self
[1:57:32] that I forgot my responsibilities to my
[1:57:34] children.
[1:57:37] &gt;&gt; Buddy, I swear to God I'd never do that
[1:57:39] again.
[1:57:41] &gt;&gt; I went back and picked them little ones
[1:57:43] up and they've been dear to me.
[1:57:47] &gt;&gt; But I realized that I had
[1:57:48] responsibilities.
[1:57:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:57:51] &gt;&gt; Everything that we go through, anything
[1:57:53] that we do through life, we've got
[1:57:55] responsibilities that we've got to meet.
[1:57:57] Do you understand?
[1:57:59] &gt;&gt; People want to be Christians without any
[1:58:01] kind of commitment to God in his word.
[1:58:03] &gt;&gt; That's right,
[1:58:04] &gt;&gt; church. That's the way of the world.
[1:58:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:09] &gt;&gt; And that's because they lack divine
[1:58:11] love. Can you say amen? They want to
[1:58:15] profess Christ and yet want to conform
[1:58:17] to and take on the habits of the world.
[1:58:19] But brother Bram said, "A person who
[1:58:21] lives their life for their own selves
[1:58:23] lives a selfish life." We must live for
[1:58:27] others.
[1:58:30] &gt;&gt; Why? Someone's watching you.
[1:58:34] &gt;&gt; Someone's watching me.
[1:58:36] Someone's watching you.
[1:58:38] We can have our attitudes. We can we can
[1:58:41] we can we can justify things.
[1:58:46] Well, I I just need I need, you know,
[1:58:49] I'm under pressure, so it it doesn't
[1:58:52] hurt to do this. just let me get rid of
[1:58:55] my pressure. But if it's against God's
[1:58:57] word,
[1:58:59] someone's watching.
[1:59:01] &gt;&gt; It affects. You say, "Well, no one's
[1:59:04] around." But see, God's watching.
[1:59:06] &gt;&gt; And if he can't approve of my life, as
[1:59:09] long as there's something that I'm doing
[1:59:11] that is not right with God, he can't
[1:59:13] bless my life.
[1:59:15] &gt;&gt; And if my life can't be blessed by God,
[1:59:17] I can't be a blessing to somebody else.
[1:59:20] &gt;&gt; You understand?
[1:59:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:23] If the musicians will come, Ecclesiastes
[1:59:27] 12:13,
[1:59:29] it says, "Let us hear the conclusion of
[1:59:31] the whole matter. Fear God and keep his
[1:59:34] commandments, for this is the whole duty
[1:59:35] of man."
[1:59:36] &gt;&gt; That's good.
[1:59:37] &gt;&gt; Now, we know that fear
[1:59:41] in this sense does not mean that you're
[1:59:44] afraid
[1:59:45] and you're hiding. That's not it. We're
[1:59:48] not to fear God in that way.
[1:59:51] But brother Bram says it means that
[1:59:53] you're giving him respect and reverence.
[1:59:56] To fear God, you respect him. You
[1:59:59] reverence him.
[2:00:01] &gt;&gt; Our worship should be filled with fear
[2:00:03] of God.
[2:00:05] Our our duties that we do should be be
[2:00:09] motivated by the fear of God. And
[2:00:12] brother Bram said, you cannot have
[2:00:13] respect until you have fear. So when you
[2:00:17] respect God, you fear God. Notice what
[2:00:20] he says. You fear that you might
[2:00:22] displease him in some way.
[2:00:26] You fear
[2:00:27] lest you would do something wrong.
[2:00:31] Ain't that right?
[2:00:32] &gt;&gt; Then he goes on to say, I fear my
[2:00:35] mother. I fear my wife. I fear my
[2:00:39] church. I fear all God's servants unless
[2:00:43] I should put a stumbling block somewhere
[2:00:46] in their way.
[2:00:48] I fear the people. I fear the people of
[2:00:52] this city unless I should do something
[2:00:54] wrong that cause them to think I wasn't
[2:00:58] a Christian.
[2:00:59] Can you say amen?
[2:01:04] He says God demands respect for himself
[2:01:06] and for his servants. God demands
[2:01:08] respects for his servants. His servants.
[2:01:11] How we know that they're his servants is
[2:01:13] because he vindicates these servants by
[2:01:15] his word. He takes these servants and
[2:01:17] makes them servants of God and proves
[2:01:20] that they are servants by making his
[2:01:21] word work through them servants. Then as
[2:01:24] you respect that servant, you respect
[2:01:26] God. So when I respect you and you
[2:01:28] respect me and we respect each other,
[2:01:32] then we're respecting God.
[2:01:36] Ain't that right?
[2:01:38] &gt;&gt; Another place we must live for others.
[2:01:40] Bear ye one another's burdens. So
[2:01:42] fulfill the law of Christ. And we've got
[2:01:45] to have a feeling for one another. See,
[2:01:48] so walking this way of holiness should
[2:01:50] not make us exalted,
[2:01:53] make us better than somebody else and
[2:01:55] feeling like, "Yeah, I'm something. I
[2:01:57] don't know what down there is, you
[2:01:59] know." No, we ought to bear one another
[2:02:02] burden. We ought to have the feeling for
[2:02:04] one another. And therefore, when you do
[2:02:07] all you know how to do, then when you
[2:02:10] lay down at night, you you have the
[2:02:13] consolation knowing that you tried your
[2:02:15] best. He says, "I can't make everyone
[2:02:18] believe. That's impossible."
[2:02:21] Jesus couldn't do that when he was on
[2:02:22] the earth. And I know there will be just
[2:02:25] a few that believes. But if anything I
[2:02:28] can add to help to the gospel, help the
[2:02:31] gospel. That's my duty of being here is
[2:02:34] to try to help somebody
[2:02:36] along the way. Can you say amen?
[2:02:41] &gt;&gt; Oh, do you love him?
[2:02:43] [Music]
[2:02:45] &gt;&gt; God wants to use us.
[2:02:48] He separates us from the world
[2:02:53] that those that are looking at us can
[2:02:55] say, "There's God. There's something
[2:02:57] different about that individual."
[2:02:59] [Music]
[2:03:00] Oh God, at least you know
[2:03:04] you make God real to that individual.
[2:03:07] &gt;&gt; Whether they believe or not, that's not
[2:03:09] my business.
[2:03:11] But at least when I leave and I have
[2:03:14] left footprints on this earth,
[2:03:17] I'll know that if anyone follows after
[2:03:20] me, it'll lead them straight to Calvary.
[2:03:22] It'll lead them straight to God. It'll
[2:03:25] lead them to this rapture. Can you say
[2:03:27] amen? For as Paul says, you know, he
[2:03:30] separated me from my mother's womb.
[2:03:34] Then later on he says, "Follow me as I
[2:03:37] follow Christ." Follow me as I follow
[2:03:41] Christ. Can you say amen?
[2:03:43] &gt;&gt; May
[2:03:44] [Music]
[2:03:46] as we live separate lives and follow
[2:03:50] after Christ. You love him. Amen. Amen.
[2:03:54] Amen.
[2:03:55] [Music]
[2:04:01] I am.
[2:04:04] [Music]
[2:04:07] Oh, if anybody
[2:04:12] asks you
[2:04:15] just who
[2:04:16] I am,
[2:04:19] oh, just tell them
[2:04:22] I am redeemed.
[2:04:27] Sing it again. Oh,
[2:04:30] I am
[2:04:32] redeemed.
[2:04:34] I've been bought with
[2:04:37] a price.
[2:04:40] Jesus
[2:04:42] has changed my whole life.
[2:04:50] And if anybody
[2:04:53] asks you
[2:04:56] just who I am,
[2:05:00] oh, just tell them
[2:05:03] I am. Well, aren't you glad you're
[2:05:06] redeemed this morning? Oh,
[2:05:11] I am redeemed.
[2:05:15] I've been bought with a price.
[2:05:21] Jesus
[2:05:23] has changed my whole life.
[2:05:30] And if anybody
[2:05:34] ask you,
[2:05:35] [Music]
[2:05:38] bless the name of the Lord.
[2:05:41] Oh, tell them
[2:05:44] I am redeemed.
[2:05:50] Oh yes, I am
[2:05:54] redeemed.
[2:05:56] I've been bought with
[2:05:59] a price.
[2:06:02] Jesus
[2:06:04] has changed my whole life.
[2:06:11] And if anybody
[2:06:15] asks you
[2:06:18] just who I am,
[2:06:23] tell them
[2:06:25] I have redeemed. Sing the last lines.
[2:06:31] Oh, if anybody
[2:06:35] asks you
[2:06:38] just who
[2:06:40] I am,
[2:06:43] tell them
[2:06:46] I am redeemed.
[2:06:51] There's that song if uh going up yonder.
[2:06:57] [Music]
[2:07:00] Um, if you want to know
[2:07:06] where I'm going
[2:07:11] where I'm going
[2:07:15] someday soon,
[2:07:21] if you want to know
[2:07:24] [Music]
[2:07:25] where I'm going,
[2:07:30] where I'm going
[2:07:35] oh soon.
[2:07:39] Oh, I'm going up yonder.
[2:07:45] Going up yonder.
[2:07:50] Going up yonder
[2:07:53] to be with my Lord.
[2:07:58] Oh, I'm going up yonder.
[2:08:03] [Music]
[2:08:04] Going up yonder.
[2:08:08] Oh, going up yonder
[2:08:12] to be with my Lord.
[2:08:18] Now I can take the pain
[2:08:23] and the heartaches they bring.
[2:08:27] For there's a comfort in knowing
[2:08:31] I'll soon be gone.
[2:08:35] Glory.
[2:08:37] And as God gives me grace,
[2:08:41] I'm going to run this race. How am I
[2:08:45] going to run it until I see my Savior
[2:08:51] face to face?
[2:08:54] Oh yes, I'm going up beyond.
[2:09:01] I'm going up yonder.
[2:09:05] Oh, I'm going up yonder
[2:09:09] to be with my Lord.
[2:09:13] Yeah. Yes. I'm going up yonder.
[2:09:20] I'm going up yonder.
[2:09:24] I'm going up yonder
[2:09:28] to be with my Lord.
[2:09:33] Now if anybody ask you
[2:09:39] where I'm going,
[2:09:43] where I'm going.
[2:09:46] There's a lot of questions going around
[2:09:48] today.
[2:09:50] Want to know where we're going? What's
[2:09:52] our future? Well, if they ask you,
[2:09:56] oh, where I'm going,
[2:10:02] where I'm going, it ain't to the world
[2:10:05] council of churches.
[2:10:08] I'm going in a rapture. Oh, I'm going in
[2:10:12] a rapture.
[2:10:14] [Music]
[2:10:15] Oh, I'm going in a rapture.
[2:10:20] I'm going in the rapture
[2:10:24] to be with my Lord.
[2:10:28] Tell him for me I'm going in the
[2:10:31] rapture.
[2:10:34] Oh, I'm going in the rapture.
[2:10:39] I'm going in the rapture.
[2:10:43] Oh, just tell the devil this morning
[2:10:46] you're going. Oh, I'm going in the
[2:10:50] rapture.
[2:10:53] I'm going in the rapture.
[2:10:57] Oh, I'm going in the rapture.
[2:11:00] [Music]
[2:11:02] Shake off those bands of heaviness and
[2:11:05] just worship him. I'm going in the
[2:11:09] rapture.
[2:11:11] Oh, I'm going in the rapture. What a
[2:11:15] great thing to know it.
[2:11:17] What a great thing to be able to confess
[2:11:20] it.
[2:11:22] Hallelu.
[2:11:24] Well, now I can take the pain
[2:11:30] and all the heartache that it brings.
[2:11:35] But there's a comfort in knowing
[2:11:39] we're soon going to be gone.
[2:11:44] As God gives the grace,
[2:11:49] I'm going to run. Keep running the race
[2:11:54] until I see my savior
[2:11:57] face. Run with patience, church.
[2:12:02] Oh, I'm going in the right church.
[2:12:09] The world's falling apart.
[2:12:12] Rush is rising to the sea.
[2:12:15] But oh, I'm going in a rapture.
[2:12:19] Yes,
[2:12:21] I'm going in a rapture.
[2:12:27] I've heard the voice of resurrection.
[2:12:31] Halleluah.
[2:12:32] [Music]
[2:12:35] Can we sing it one more time?
[2:12:38] Oh yes, I am going in the rapture.
[2:12:43] [Music]
[2:12:44] Oh, going in the rapture.
[2:12:48] [Music]
[2:12:50] Going in the rapture
[2:12:53] to be with my Lord.
[2:12:58] Oh, I'm going in the rapture.
[2:13:04] Going in the rapture.
[2:13:07] Oh, going in the rapture
[2:13:11] to be with my Lord.
[2:13:19] Hallelujah.
[2:13:21] [Music]
[2:13:22] Bless the name of the Lord.
[2:13:27] Amen. Do you believe that, church?
[2:13:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yeah, we may have our struggles
[2:13:33] and may get burdened and weary and
[2:13:36] whatever else. May have to cry a tear or
[2:13:39] two or whatever, but one thing about it,
[2:13:42] we're going.
[2:13:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:13:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. We got that token. We've been
[2:13:47] separated
[2:13:49] &gt;&gt; for this purpose. Amen. God bless you is
[2:13:52] our prayer. We love you. And um after
[2:13:57] the service, if you'd like to want to u
[2:14:02] observe or watch the uh witness the uh
[2:14:06] baptism, we'd love to have you. Amen. Um
[2:14:11] but let's just bow our heads now in a
[2:14:14] word of prayer.
[2:14:16] Lord Jesus,
[2:14:18] Father, we thank you Lord that there is
