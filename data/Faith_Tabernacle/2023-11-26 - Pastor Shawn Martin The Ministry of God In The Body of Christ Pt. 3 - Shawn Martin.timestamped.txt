[33:26] his closer than a brother isn't
[33:37] he here last Sunday night but I do have
[33:40] a little bitty testimony the Lord just
[33:42] laid on my heart and um it happened a
[33:46] long time ago I was just a young mother
[33:50] and we had just had Dallas and found out
[33:54] he was about three years old that he was
[33:56] totally nonverbal
[33:57] uh he had not formed any words he
[34:00] couldn't he he made noises uh but no no
[34:04] language and I became so desperate and I
[34:09] was just praying to the Lord that he
[34:11] would help me at least to teach me how
[34:15] to have faith for my son and Terry was
[34:18] too we were just desperate and so I
[34:21] asked the Lord I said Lord Jesus uh just
[34:26] let Alice say something and I will know
[34:30] that he's all right that he's in your
[34:32] hands that you that you'll work it out
[34:35] this is the honest God's truth for a
[34:38] whole week that child went around the
[34:40] house just said M M M
[34:44] M he said it over and over and over
[34:47] again it lasted for a week he's never
[34:50] said it s but you know what that was my
[34:54] consolation that was my prayer that was
[34:57] my answer that was my faith and Heaven
[35:01] and Earth will pass away but that
[35:03] promise of whenever God chooses this
[35:07] side or the next side to let Dallas talk
[35:11] that's that's fine with me I just thank
[35:13] the Lord and I thought it would
[35:14] encourage you thank the
[35:21] Lord I think it's that's what I sing it
[35:25] last time
[35:27] [Music]
[35:29] let me just start it I don't know an
[35:33] unleavened
[35:35] word spoken by the voice of God for our
[35:45] day many have tried to add their own
[35:52] ideas and some take
[35:55] away
[35:57] [Music]

[43:06] sister Brook back with us and little
[43:08] Wyatt and amen just

[43:18] there for a while everyone was sick or
[43:21] different ones and uh but the Lord

[43:26] Lord for that and uh if you have your
[43:29] Bibles we're going to turn to the book
[43:31] of
[43:33] Ephesians amen the U first chapter I
[43:38] believe but uh we want to remember the
[43:42] church supper that we'll be having on
[43:44] the 9th of December at uh 5:00
[43:47] p.m. and it's going to be at the um
[43:51] pilot Fellowship
[43:53] Hall um where Daniel Britney got married
[43:58] um I guess where we had our birthday
[44:01] party um back in September I guess or
[44:07] August but um so we'll we'll send the
[44:11] address out uh to you uh there but we
[44:15] want to keep that in mind and also
[44:17] brother Andrew asked me to greet the
[44:20] church uh greet you all for him and uh
[44:24] so he's there in um somewhere in Georgia
[44:28] preaching for brother
[44:29] yansy and uh so we want to just keep him
[44:33] in prayer and the Lord just use him in a
[44:36] great way there and also um January our
[44:42] meeting coming up uh starting on the 8th
[44:44] through the
[44:45] 14th and uh so looking forward to that
[44:49] and um just be in prayer uh for that
[44:53] meeting and that God will just just move
[44:57] we need the Lord and and more than we
[44:59] have ever needed him we need him now and
[45:03] I I believe that the bride of
[45:06] Christ has um the privilege of of asking
[45:11] him to come and he coming and doing the
[45:15] work uh among the people of God and and
[45:20] um so many people are devoid of the
[45:22] spirit of God and that this the bride is
[45:25] in in relationship and whatever you have
[45:28] need of God will do it I I just believe
[45:32] that and um we're we're coming you know
[45:36] to the end of time and uh we we must not
[45:41] play around we we realize the needs that
[45:44] are there some's got children that need
[45:47] to be saved and maybe some here needing
[45:50] the holy ghost or whatever it would be
[45:53] and I just believe that God can move
[45:55] move in a special way and so we don't
[45:58] want this just to be a series of
[46:00] meetings we we want it to be a a
[46:03] something Supernatural that God does uh
[46:06] for us and so uh but before we go into
[46:10] the word may we just bow our heads and
[46:12] talk to our Lord
[46:15] father truly it is an honor to to be
[46:20] here gathered with
[46:22] Believers Lord and knowing that two or
[46:26] three are gathered in your name that you
[46:29] promised you would be here with us and
[46:33] Lord we're under great expectation and
[46:36] we're now coming to the most important
[46:39] part and that is the word for Lord it
[46:42] was by your word that you created Lord
[46:46] things that were not and you brought it
[46:49] into existence it's always been by Your
[46:52] Word father and Lord you have gathered
[46:55] us Lord Lord by Your Word of a prophet
[46:57] in this age and now we're just praying
[47:00] that you would just do something
[47:02] downside of us Lord that take that which
[47:05] is lacking father and create a work
[47:08] within us Lord you know what we have
[47:11] need of Lord may your word uh meet the
[47:15] need we ask it father and anoint both
[47:18] speaker and hearer in Jesus Christ's
[47:21] name and the church says am amen and
[47:25] amen and so we look at Ephesians and I
[47:32] um we we want to look at Ephesians 1 and
[47:39] um let let's start at the 15th
[47:42] verse wherefore I also after I heard of
[47:46] your faith in the Lord Jesus and love
[47:48] unto all the saints cease not to give
[47:51] thanks for you making mention of you in
[47:53] my prayers that the God of our Lord
[47:57] Jesus Christ the father of Glory may
[47:59] give unto you the spirit of wisdom and
[48:01] Revelation in the knowledge of him the
[48:04] eyes of your understanding being
[48:06] enlightened that you may know what is
[48:08] the hope of his calling and what the
[48:10] riches of the glory of his inheritance
[48:13] in the
[48:13] Saints and what is the exceeding
[48:16] greatness of his power to us word who
[48:18] believe according to the working of his
[48:21] mighty power which he wrought in Christ
[48:23] when he raised him from the dead and set
[48:26] him at his own right hand in the
[48:29] Heavenly places far above all
[48:32] principalities and power and might and
[48:34] dominion and every name that is named
[48:36] not only in this world but also in that
[48:39] which is to come and ha put all things
[48:42] under his feet and gave him to be the
[48:44] head over all things to the church which
[48:47] is his body the fullness of him that
[48:51] filth all in all amen you can have your
[48:56] seats this
[48:58] morning and um I want
[49:02] to
[49:04] continue uh on the the subject of the
[49:09] um the ministry of God in the body of
[49:12] Christ and here in Ephesians
[49:17] 4 and um one I'm going to read uh I did
[49:22] not give this to them uh for for the
[49:26] screen but if they can type it in they
[49:28] can Ephesians
[49:30] 4:1 uh through 4 but Paul says I
[49:33] therefore the prisoner of the Lord uh
[49:36] beseech you that you walk worthy of the
[49:39] vocation wherewith you are called with
[49:42] all loneliness and meekness with
[49:44] longsuffering forbearing one another in
[49:46] love endeavoring to keep the unity of
[49:48] the spirit in the bond of
[49:50] Peace there is one body everybody say
[49:53] there is one body one body and one
[49:56] Spirit even as you are called in one
[49:59] hope of your calling amen and so we we
[50:05] look that
[50:07] um that one body is the body of Jesus
[50:11] Christ and and the ministry that we
[50:15] we've been talking about is the the
[50:18] ministry that is in the body and it's
[50:22] the ministry of Christ and um um this
[50:28] ministry is the manifestation of Jesus
[50:32] Christ Resurrection the prophet said uh
[50:36] um so the ministry that is in the
[50:38] body is is is the ministry or the
[50:44] manifestation of Jesus Christ's
[50:48] Resurrection now in 1960 brother bradam
[50:51] said the same Ministry that the son went
[50:55] down in the same light that he went down
[50:58] in is coming again in the resurrection
[51:02] power now I believe that we're no longer
[51:06] saying that it is coming I believe that
[51:09] we can truly say it is here this this
[51:14] ministry that brother brandham said is
[51:17] is coming the ministry the same Ministry
[51:20] that the sun went down in is here in the
[51:24] resurrection power
[51:26] so uh uh and and you just I pray that we
[51:31] can make some sense uh to you today but
[51:35] we as we have said and and brother
[51:37] brandham talked about it that God made a
[51:39] covenant uh uh in the Old Testament and
[51:43] he also made a covenant in the New
[51:45] Testament with Jesus Christ and remember
[51:49] as we've told talked about it brother
[51:52] brandham talked about when the two when
[51:54] two part come together two men come
[51:57] together to make a covenant they would
[51:59] cut an animal or kill an animal they
[52:01] would cut it in two and then uh uh they
[52:06] would uh the two parties to make that
[52:09] Covenant they would stand in between uh
[52:12] the the the the two halves of this
[52:15] animal and uh uh then they would write a
[52:19] covenant on a piece of paper or whatever
[52:22] they had a parchment uh uh and they they
[52:26] would make this write this Covenant out
[52:28] both of what they agreed to do and then
[52:31] they'd both make a vow an oath that let
[52:34] us be as this dead animal uh if we
[52:37] failed to meet the the uh uh our part of
[52:41] the Covenant responsibilities and then
[52:45] they would tear that uh paper in two and
[52:49] one would keep uh one part the other
[52:52] keep the other part and then they wi
[52:55] that that Covenant was
[52:57] fulfilled uh then they would meet
[53:00] together at that that spot I guess and
[53:04] and um that Covenant uh uh had to
[53:07] dovetail both both halves had to
[53:10] dovetail uh to together and and and so
[53:15] in in other words this the the the the
[53:18] the the Covenant uh now has been brought
[53:21] into its fullness then they meet
[53:24] together and the Covenant has to Dov
[53:27] tail uh together in other words no one
[53:30] can impersonate this dovetail or this
[53:32] this Covenant uh uh brother brandham
[53:35] said to make this Covenant right these
[53:37] two pieces of paper had to dovetail
[53:39] straight together letter by letter for
[53:43] it would be the same piece of paper and
[53:46] he said both pieces had to come exactly
[53:49] the same letter by letter ain't that
[53:53] right so this covenant could not not be
[53:56] duplicated uh or impersonated and so
[54:00] then at at Calvary God makes the
[54:03] Covenant and he he tore Christ apart and
[54:07] he uh uh uh by separating his soul from
[54:10] his body and God raised the body of
[54:13] Jesus Christ on the third day took it up
[54:17] and uh into heaven and he uh set it uh
[54:21] set him on his right hand and then the
[54:24] prophet says on the day of Pentecost he
[54:27] sent down the spirit that was in Jesus
[54:30] Christ and the Covenant is now with the
[54:34] church ain't that right amen amen The
[54:37] Same Spirit that was in Christ is now in
[54:40] the church and so he says see when the
[54:43] church comes together in the
[54:45] Resurrection The Same Spirit that was in
[54:49] Jesus Christ that was tore out of him
[54:52] will have to be in the church you can't
[54:55] copy anything like it you cannot make
[54:58] nothing different from it it's got to be
[55:01] the same holy spirit that dwelt in
[55:04] Christ and when the Rapture comes when
[55:07] that body comes his bride that was tore
[55:11] from him or the Holy Ghost will bring
[55:14] that bride just exactly Dov tail right
[55:18] into the body of Jesus Christ ain't that
[55:21] right so what is the church what is the
[55:24] body it's life of his life bone of his
[55:27] bone flesh of his flesh word of his word
[55:30] power of his power she is him ain't that
[55:34] right so God in Christ fulfilled one
[55:38] part of the Covenant but now it's God in
[55:41] his church fulfilling the other part of
[55:44] the Covenant and when the Rapture comes
[55:47] there will not be one thing left
[55:50] unfulfilled concerning this Bride Can
[55:53] you say Amen she she will fulfill
[55:56] everything that God promised of her amen
[56:00] and so uh when this Covenant is brought
[56:03] into its full strength then this
[56:07] Covenant brother Bram said when a
[56:09] covenant is confirmed with God the
[56:12] church the people that goes in into the
[56:16] body to be his bride will be exactly the
[56:20] same spirit that was upon on Christ
[56:23] doing the same things the same Ministry
[56:26] the same power and it'll come together
[56:30] and be word by word the same confirming
[56:35] the Covenant can you say Amen it cannot
[56:38] be I I I say this now it cannot be
[56:41] impersonated nobody can impersonate this
[56:44] bride no one can make themselves bride
[56:48] she's got to be part of him which is
[56:51] part of the Covenant ain't that right
[56:54] now this is why Luke 17:30 means so much
[56:58] to us the revealing of the son of man
[57:02] for it is Jesus Christ the same
[57:05] yesterday today and forever we've had
[57:08] ministries of all Roberts and Billy
[57:10] Graham and and and Jack Cole and and a
[57:13] uh AA uh Allen and and on and on and on
[57:16] but this ministry was the revealing of
[57:20] the son of man amen same Ministry so
[57:23] brother brandham says see Christ his
[57:26] ministry is in his bride which is his
[57:31] body the superat Natural Body of his see
[57:35] his spirit is in there living his life
[57:39] right out until him and the church
[57:42] becomes one in the wedding can you say
[57:46] man now we are not going in the Rapture
[57:49] to a wedding we are already married and
[57:52] United with him uh uh here can you say
[57:55] Amen we're going to a merit supper of
[57:59] the lamb but the wedding has taken place
[58:02] here can you say amen amen see so they
[58:06] become one they become one when not when
[58:11] the Rapture takes place they have become
[58:13] one now amen because now it's the same
[58:17] ministry as he had is now in the bride
[58:21] of Christ he takes them just a little
[58:25] minority in the last days can you say
[58:28] Amen now um we know that there are
[58:31] really two Ministries two kinds of
[58:34] ministry in the world God operates one
[58:37] in his body Satan operates the other and
[58:42] and both are able to achieve their
[58:44] purpose by Ministry uh again God
[58:47] operates his ministry through his church
[58:50] which is his body Satan's Ministry
[58:53] operates through his church amen which
[58:56] is his intellectual bride amen now
[58:59] throughout the church uh ages seven
[59:02] Church ages there have been two churches
[59:05] and and uh there there is the church
[59:08] that is the true vine brother brandom
[59:10] calls it the True Vine and then there's
[59:12] the church uh which brother brandham
[59:14] calls the false Vine and and so uh uh
[59:19] then brother BR says see but the spirit
[59:21] speaks to both of them in each age as
[59:25] though they are one as though there's
[59:28] only one Church in in in the seven
[59:31] Church ages but we understand that he's
[59:35] actually speaking to two churches on one
[59:37] hand he's praising and on the other hand
[59:41] he's rebuking see and so uh uh
[59:44] Revelations
[59:46] 2:23 uh uh God says I will kill her
[59:50] children with death and all the churches
[59:53] everybody say all the churches
[59:55] all the churches see throughout each age
[59:58] see shall know that I am he which
[1:00:02] searcheth the Reigns and uh and hearts
[1:00:06] see and so uh uh now brother BR says see
[1:00:10] this m this scripture makes clear to us
[1:00:12] that there are
[1:00:13] churches uh uh and some of those
[1:00:16] churches most EV dently do not know that
[1:00:21] he is the one who searcheth the reins
[1:00:24] and the hearts so he's going to prove to
[1:00:27] them that is that that is so see and now
[1:00:32] then what churches will be those that do
[1:00:35] not know this truth of course it is the
[1:00:38] false Vine group because the True
[1:00:41] Believers certainly know that judgment
[1:00:43] begins at the house of God and they
[1:00:46] being God-fearing judge themselves that
[1:00:49] they be not judged so then he says why
[1:00:52] does God call these churches his
[1:00:55] churches even though they are the false
[1:00:58] Vine he says the truth of the matter is
[1:01:01] that they are
[1:01:03] Christians he said see but they're not
[1:01:06] Christians of the spirit they are
[1:01:08] Christians of the flesh they are bearing
[1:01:12] the name of Christ in vain for Mark 7:7
[1:01:18] Jesus says how be it in vain do they
[1:01:20] worship me see teaching for doctrines
[1:01:23] the Commandments of me ain't that right
[1:01:25] so he says indeed they are Christians
[1:01:28] for what else could they be see a
[1:01:31] Muhammad is a Muhammad see that is his
[1:01:34] religion no matter how he lives it uh
[1:01:38] see because he subscribes in theory to
[1:01:41] what the Quran teaches so he is Muhammad
[1:01:44] no matter uh uh no matter how he lives
[1:01:47] and no matter whatever but since he uh
[1:01:50] uh uh sub uh uh uh uh subscribes in
[1:01:54] theory to the Quran he is automatically
[1:01:57] Muhammad see well in the same way a
[1:02:00] Christian is a Christian as long as he
[1:02:03] subscribes to the fact that Jesus is the
[1:02:06] son of God born of a virgin was
[1:02:08] crucified and died and rose again that
[1:02:11] he is the savior of mankind Etc in fact
[1:02:15] in the Le oysan age there will be those
[1:02:17] who call themselves Christians because
[1:02:19] they because they subscribe to the Fine
[1:02:22] qualities of Jesus while reserving to
[1:02:25] themselves the the right to deny his
[1:02:28] deity see Christian Scientists have done
[1:02:31] that already as well as multitudes who
[1:02:34] preach a social gospel he is a nominal
[1:02:37] Christian and belongs to the church but
[1:02:41] he is not a true or spiritual believer
[1:02:45] for that kind of a Believer is one who
[1:02:48] has been baptized into the body of
[1:02:51] Christ and is a me M of him can you say
[1:02:56] Amen so so then we find this is where
[1:03:01] the tears and the wheat they're planted
[1:03:03] in the same field they grow up together
[1:03:06] they they they receive the same
[1:03:08] blessings of the Sun the rain and and
[1:03:11] and all of these things but by seed
[1:03:13] they're totally different and God says
[1:03:16] don't tear up the tears let them grow up
[1:03:19] together can you sayen see so we find
[1:03:22] this is a prophet IC of the false Vine
[1:03:26] being planted in the same as as the True
[1:03:30] Vine in the same time and and and and
[1:03:34] these things so now this false Vine
[1:03:36] started in the first church age amen and
[1:03:40] and Revelations 2 and 1 it says unto the
[1:03:43] angel of the Church of Ephesus write
[1:03:46] these things saith he that holdeth the
[1:03:48] Seven Stars in his right hand who
[1:03:51] walketh in the midst of the seven golden
[1:03:54] C
[1:03:54] candlesticks I Know Thy works and thy
[1:03:57] labor and thy patience and how thou
[1:04:00] canest not bear them which are evil and
[1:04:03] thou Hast tried them which say they are
[1:04:07] Apostles and are not and has found them
[1:04:12] Liars can you say Amen well this first
[1:04:15] church age it it it actually started uh
[1:04:19] 30 years or so after the day of
[1:04:23] Pentecost and amen and uh so it didn't
[1:04:26] start uh uh that long afterward and
[1:04:29] already the false Vine had been planted
[1:04:33] amen and and and this church amen and
[1:04:37] I'm just taking excerpts of the the the
[1:04:39] church age book but this church had
[1:04:42] already left its first love meaning that
[1:04:46] it had fallen from its origin which was
[1:04:50] Pentecost ain't that right but but no
[1:04:53] matter what it was amen and the church
[1:04:56] did fall but there was always an elect
[1:05:00] out of the each age amen that were true
[1:05:03] to what they believed and and knew to be
[1:05:06] the truth can you sayen but this church
[1:05:09] had falling amen this is where this V
[1:05:12] Vine come falling from their first love
[1:05:16] amen uh which was uh uh Pentecost uh
[1:05:20] fallen from its origin a Pentecost and
[1:05:23] and and so brother BR said this church
[1:05:26] was in danger of being taken away from
[1:05:29] the leading of the Holy Spirit the
[1:05:31] control of the spirit and it's the same
[1:05:34] thing that happened after Moses took the
[1:05:39] uh uh children of Israel out of Egypt
[1:05:41] amen see uh uh God had provided Israel
[1:05:47] amen a a a a pillar of fire amen a cloud
[1:05:52] a prophetic prophetic utterance Miracles
[1:05:55] and signs and god-given wonders to lead
[1:05:59] the people ain't that right amen that
[1:06:02] was God's perfect plan was was
[1:06:05] Vindication after Vindication
[1:06:07] Supernatural Vindication amen and and
[1:06:10] the prophet said this was to be done by
[1:06:13] God Select god ordained and God equipped
[1:06:18] and God sent men with the whole Camp
[1:06:22] being dominated by a holy ghost move
[1:06:26] ain't that right but the people rebelled
[1:06:30] amen and they asked amen for a set of
[1:06:34] rules and Creeds to go by amen they
[1:06:38] wanted something else than just to
[1:06:40] follow God's Vindicated prophet and
[1:06:43] message of the hour and he said see then
[1:06:46] they wanted to be exactly like the world
[1:06:49] and they went into complete apostasy and
[1:06:52] Oblivion ain't that right well this is
[1:06:55] how the first church age started see
[1:06:57] amen each and each age uh afterward just
[1:07:01] got worse and worse and worse until the
[1:07:04] holy spirit is completely rejected in
[1:07:07] this age and God Must Destroy amen the
[1:07:12] people the world can you say amen amen
[1:07:15] so we we find this false Vine it was
[1:07:17] planted in the first church age it
[1:07:20] started out as the Deeds of the nicians
[1:07:23] then it become a Doctrine then it become
[1:07:25] a standard then it become uh uh an
[1:07:28] unbending way that that you had to
[1:07:30] either believe this or you weren't part
[1:07:32] of us and and uh uh these things and so
[1:07:36] and and brother Braham says it finally
[1:07:38] took over and God was pushed aside now
[1:07:40] we're not talking about the body of
[1:07:42] Christ we're talking about the the what
[1:07:45] the vine that Satan had planted ain't
[1:07:47] that right and he says it started out
[1:07:50] small quietly and inoffensively it
[1:07:53] looked good it seemed very sound then it
[1:07:56] caught and like a python it it it
[1:07:59] squeezed out the very breath and killed
[1:08:02] all the spirituality there was in the
[1:08:05] church amen see and so this tells us
[1:08:09] that the false Vine Works in subtility
[1:08:12] in deception in it it it it comes in in
[1:08:16] in such an approach that people don't
[1:08:19] even understand amen what is coming
[1:08:22] their way or what they're getting
[1:08:24] involved in and and these things so look
[1:08:27] look at what Paul would say in in
[1:08:30] Colossians 2 and6 he says beware lest
[1:08:33] any man spoil you through philosophy and
[1:08:35] vain deceit after the traditions of men
[1:08:39] after the r rudiments of the world and
[1:08:42] not after Christ ain't that right beware
[1:08:46] why amen you you would think well if it
[1:08:49] was just one church then then you
[1:08:51] wouldn't have to worry about these
[1:08:53] things but here is trying to warn that
[1:08:55] elect be aware of what's coming be aware
[1:08:58] of what's happening in in Philippian uh
[1:09:02] uh I believe Philippians 3 And1 Paul
[1:09:05] writes finally my brethren rejoice in
[1:09:08] the Lord to write the same things to you
[1:09:11] to me indeed is not Grievious but for
[1:09:13] you it is safe Paul's writings were safe
[1:09:18] Paul's warnings were safe can you say
[1:09:21] amen amen see be be Ware of dogs beware
[1:09:25] of evil workers Beware of the concision
[1:09:29] see amen see so then Paul would write a
[1:09:32] false Brethren who were brought in
[1:09:35] unaware look at Jude uh 3 and 4 uh he
[1:09:40] warns the church saying beloved when I
[1:09:42] gave all diligence to write unto you of
[1:09:45] the common salvation it was needful for
[1:09:47] me to write unto you and to exhort you
[1:09:51] that you should earnestly contend for
[1:09:54] the faith now church if there's ever a
[1:09:57] time to earnestly contend for the faith
[1:10:00] that's been restored it is now it is not
[1:10:05] time to get laxed it's not time to say
[1:10:07] well I'm in a mess's church amen Satan's
[1:10:11] Satan he he his arms reach all the way
[1:10:14] in message churches too can you say Amen
[1:10:17] see so earnestly contend for the faith
[1:10:20] which was once delivered unto the Saints
[1:10:23] don't let anyone down this message to
[1:10:26] you can you say Amen don't let anyone
[1:10:30] degrade this message to you yes sir see
[1:10:34] this message is to bring you back to the
[1:10:37] faith that was once delivered he says
[1:10:40] for there are certain men crept in
[1:10:44] unawares who were before of old ordained
[1:10:47] to this condemnation ungodly men they
[1:10:50] can range from preachers they can
[1:10:52] arrange from deacons musicians uh uh
[1:10:56] people sitting in the audience and yet
[1:10:59] Paul would call them Brethren or men
[1:11:02] crept in awes uh ungodly men turning the
[1:11:06] grace of our God into lasciviousness and
[1:11:10] denying the only Lord God and our Lord
[1:11:13] Jesus Christ so then we find as we've
[1:11:16] talked before that the false Vine is an
[1:11:19] angel of Light until it gets a hold of
[1:11:22] you that's what the prophet said the
[1:11:24] false Vine is an angel of Light until it
[1:11:27] gets a hold of you now brother Brown
[1:11:29] says this I believe in leadership but it
[1:11:32] is not the leadership of men I believe
[1:11:34] in I believe in the leadership of the
[1:11:36] Holy Ghost coming through the word see I
[1:11:39] believe also that God has set men in the
[1:11:42] church men who are gifted by the spirit
[1:11:45] and they will keep the church in order I
[1:11:47] believe that I believe also that the
[1:11:50] church is ruled over by men that God
[1:11:53] sins to take charge but that rule is by
[1:11:56] the word so that it is not men really
[1:12:00] ruling but the spirit of God for the
[1:12:02] word and spirit are
[1:12:05] one can you say Amen see so then we find
[1:12:09] amen that Paul in in Hebrews 13 and7
[1:12:13] remember them which have the rule over
[1:12:16] you who have spoken unto you the word of
[1:12:19] God whose Faith follow considering the
[1:12:22] end of their
[1:12:25] conversation ain't that right see so the
[1:12:29] the the false Vine a man was getting a
[1:12:32] hold of a church see a hold in the
[1:12:36] church and was teaching that leadership
[1:12:38] by man was right see well and and and
[1:12:42] and and it's it's uh uh God uses men for
[1:12:46] leadership but when they get out of the
[1:12:48] word then they have no right to
[1:12:51] lead ain't that right amen see so so
[1:12:54] they were teaching leadership by man
[1:12:57] amen but see like like Moses Moses was
[1:13:00] called of God ordained of God to lead
[1:13:03] the people amen out of Egypt he was a
[1:13:06] Vindicated Prophet but then there arose
[1:13:09] dathan and Kora and balum amen they
[1:13:12] rosed up in their Ministries their gifts
[1:13:15] and whatever they would have amen none
[1:13:18] of them compared to what Moses had now
[1:13:21] you think of that none of them had the
[1:13:23] pill glorifier none of them was
[1:13:25] Vindicated like Moses was and yet in
[1:13:27] their Ministry they were able to deceive
[1:13:30] the people and draw them away from
[1:13:33] Moses see so the prophet says the these
[1:13:36] men amen took upon themselves to be the
[1:13:39] leader of the people God did not place
[1:13:42] them as Leaders they took it upon
[1:13:44] themselves to be leader of the people
[1:13:48] and what did they do they caus the
[1:13:49] people to to split from Moses Who was
[1:13:53] the Vindicated of God ain't that right
[1:13:55] see so their leadership was not inspired
[1:13:59] of the spirit it was not Vindicated of
[1:14:01] the spirit their leadership was
[1:14:04] intellectual reasoning and not God
[1:14:08] inspired ain't that right so instead of
[1:14:11] these men using their influence to bring
[1:14:14] the people in unity around the word of
[1:14:16] the hour to Rally them around God's
[1:14:19] Vindicated leadership they took it upon
[1:14:22] themselves to divide the people amen and
[1:14:25] brought in chaos and caused the people
[1:14:27] to disbelieve Moses to Grumble against
[1:14:30] Moses to murmur against God and and all
[1:14:33] of these things and we know that even
[1:14:36] God was going to kill them all amen uh
[1:14:39] uh just got tired of it you know which
[1:14:41] he did those god well God did draw the
[1:14:44] line in the sand and and and those that
[1:14:47] were with Moses had to come with Moses
[1:14:49] and those that were with Kora and all of
[1:14:51] these things and and the Earth swallowed
[1:14:54] those that were with Kora and and and
[1:14:57] them swallowed them up and so is it
[1:14:59] today the world is swallowing those up
[1:15:02] amen that turn against this message of
[1:15:04] the hour can you say Amen see so in in
[1:15:08] the church first church age men who were
[1:15:11] of that false Vine taught that the
[1:15:14] church had to be governed and I want to
[1:15:16] say this today that Satan is never
[1:15:19] against
[1:15:19] leadership he's only against the
[1:15:22] leadership that God has ordained amen
[1:15:25] but he's not against leadership at all
[1:15:28] no man who takes the people away from
[1:15:30] the message is against leadership as
[1:15:33] long as they're following them and not
[1:15:35] the Vindicated prophet of the hour no
[1:15:38] man who splits a church is against
[1:15:39] leadership they'll talk against the
[1:15:41] pastor they'll R you know get people
[1:15:43] away from the pastor but they want to be
[1:15:45] the pastor they want to be the leader
[1:15:47] they want to be the one that influences
[1:15:49] amen the people that they have gathered
[1:15:52] see so see that's what was happening in
[1:15:55] the in the first church age and it's
[1:15:57] always happened amen see they taught a
[1:16:00] control over the people but instead of
[1:16:03] doing it God's way they simply took
[1:16:06] Authority and vested all the spiritual
[1:16:09] power in their own hands and come out
[1:16:12] with the Holy priesthood standing
[1:16:14] between God and the people see they went
[1:16:17] right back to the old aonic uh system
[1:16:20] they became Antichrist everybody say
[1:16:23] they became Antichrist they became
[1:16:26] Antichrist for they disposed of his
[1:16:29] meteor uh meteor ship and imposed their
[1:16:32] own they done Away With Jesus Christ as
[1:16:35] being the mediator and they became the
[1:16:38] mediator oh my and God hated that the
[1:16:42] Ephesians hated that and any True
[1:16:44] Believer will hate it too see he says
[1:16:47] that separated the people God's people
[1:16:50] are supposed to be one by one one Spirit
[1:16:53] everybody say by one Spirit are they all
[1:16:56] baptized into one body and everyone
[1:17:00] everyone is to be moved upon by the Holy
[1:17:04] Ghost and everyone is to participate in
[1:17:08] the worship of God but men wanted the
[1:17:12] preeminent so they took over control and
[1:17:15] Bishops became archbishops and with
[1:17:17] imposing titles they bypassed the word
[1:17:20] of God and taught their own doctrines
[1:17:23] see they got the people to obey them
[1:17:25] until the time came that the way of
[1:17:28] worship did not in any way at all
[1:17:31] resemble the early days after Pentecost
[1:17:35] see these Deeds were the beginning of
[1:17:38] apostolic
[1:17:39] succession it took the people from the
[1:17:42] experience at Pentecost it took them
[1:17:45] from the book of Acts
[1:17:48] right can you say Amen see it was the
[1:17:52] false Vine so brother BR says see from
[1:17:54] Apostolic secession it was one easy and
[1:17:58] quick step to church
[1:18:01] membership you you got to belong to the
[1:18:03] church by membership see and as and and
[1:18:07] they take that as the means of Saving
[1:18:09] Grace so the word was reduced to a Creed
[1:18:13] Antichrist by his Spirit was
[1:18:16] predominating the church the false Vine
[1:18:20] can you say amen amen so the people are
[1:18:24] led by people brother Bram says this the
[1:18:27] people are led by people who presume to
[1:18:30] be what they are not see amen see they
[1:18:34] they say they're called they say they're
[1:18:36] Vindicated they say Amen but they're
[1:18:38] really not and the people follow that
[1:18:41] stuff you understand what I'm saying so
[1:18:43] the leadership of man takes the people
[1:18:47] away from the word of God God ordained
[1:18:50] men will never take amen the the people
[1:18:53] away from the word of God Amen but the
[1:18:56] false Vine does take the people away
[1:18:58] from the word of God the false Vine
[1:19:01] takes the people away amen from their
[1:19:03] faith in
[1:19:05] God to where the people's faith is in in
[1:19:08] in that
[1:19:11] individual can't have Revival unless the
[1:19:13] individual's there can't get my healing
[1:19:15] unless that individual prays for me you
[1:19:18] know you know I I don't know if I'm
[1:19:20] going to make it but if that individual
[1:19:22] can tell me that he saw something and
[1:19:24] and he can prophesy over me I'll I'll be
[1:19:26] doing
[1:19:28] better amen see leadership of men takes
[1:19:32] the people from the word of God brother
[1:19:34] Bram never took us from the word of God
[1:19:36] but he put our faith in the word of
[1:19:40] God can you say amen amen so they take
[1:19:44] people away from the word of God this is
[1:19:45] how the church went from Jesus name
[1:19:47] baptism to baptizing in titles this is
[1:19:51] how it went from believing in one God to
[1:19:53] believing in three persons of one God
[1:19:56] see there and there's no such thing in
[1:19:58] the Bible but now in this age it's
[1:20:01] accepted as the word and and and if you
[1:20:04] if you say that that you know and you
[1:20:06] quote what the prophet says that Devil's
[1:20:08] travel in the name of Father Son and
[1:20:10] Holy Ghost he travels in them titles
[1:20:12] amen that just blows most people's minds
[1:20:15] Amen to even come up against that and
[1:20:17] say that amen because now it is accepted
[1:20:21] as a way of life it is
[1:20:24] not it's a false
[1:20:27] Vine that was planted in the first
[1:20:29] church
[1:20:31] age about
[1:20:33] it so
[1:20:35] then you find for a man to belong to an
[1:20:39] organization any organization and preach
[1:20:41] the truth that organization will put him
[1:20:44] out cuz you cannot stay in there and
[1:20:47] still be led by God ain't that right see
[1:20:51] now the prophet said God never did
[1:20:53] associate Saint and Satan's church
[1:20:55] together God leads his church he does
[1:20:58] not expect political leaders to lead
[1:21:01] them and not even Church politics to
[1:21:04] lead them God leads his own people can
[1:21:07] you say
[1:21:08] Amen yes sir see so the Apostle Paul saw
[1:21:13] this happening in the first church age
[1:21:15] and notice what he said in Acts 20 and
[1:21:17] 27 for I have not shunn to declare unto
[1:21:20] you all the counsel of God take heed
[1:21:23] therefore unto yourselves and to all the
[1:21:25] flock over which the Holy Ghost hath
[1:21:27] made you overseers to feed the Church of
[1:21:30] God which he purchased with his own
[1:21:32] blood for I know this that after my
[1:21:34] departing shall Grievious wolves enter
[1:21:37] in among you not sparing the
[1:21:40] flock man can you imagine people
[1:21:43] claiming to be an ordained of God and
[1:21:47] they don't care about uh uh about the
[1:21:50] Sheep at all they're going to preach
[1:21:52] their own ideas their own ways they'll
[1:21:55] scatter the
[1:21:57] flock so he said see not sparing the
[1:22:00] flock also of your own selves amen right
[1:22:03] among you shall men arise speaking
[1:22:05] perverse things to draw away disciples
[1:22:08] after them so see Paul warned the elect
[1:22:13] he warns the elect about this subtle
[1:22:15] priesthood coming and taking over with
[1:22:18] its false doctrines and he knew that
[1:22:21] they would implement a new way of
[1:22:24] worship that would exclude the people
[1:22:27] from having any part in a holy spirit
[1:22:31] Ministry and and so now it was it was
[1:22:34] the only the priesthood that was
[1:22:36] spiritual it was only the the priesthood
[1:22:38] that was holy it was
[1:22:40] only certain ones you you you understand
[1:22:43] and the people became more deprived of
[1:22:46] the spirit of God they become more
[1:22:47] ignorant of the word of God they become
[1:22:49] more to where they didn't even have a
[1:22:51] clue of what the word of God speaks this
[1:22:53] is why God would have to send a prophet
[1:22:56] to to take us back to original
[1:22:59] word amen amen so brother brand says see
[1:23:04] even right today among those who claim
[1:23:07] to be free and full of the spirit
[1:23:08] there's not too much freedom in the
[1:23:10] leoty and the best we can see is a few
[1:23:14] preachers with inspired preaching while
[1:23:16] the flock just sits there and tries
[1:23:18] tries to absorb it see he said but here
[1:23:22] we we find where Paul would tell us and
[1:23:25] he taught that all when all come
[1:23:27] together and all all had the leading of
[1:23:30] the Holy Spirit and all participated in
[1:23:35] spiritual worship now this is what Paul
[1:23:37] would teach that New Testament Church
[1:23:40] that all would come together and when
[1:23:42] they did come together all participated
[1:23:45] in spiritual worship and the leading of
[1:23:48] the holy spirit amen can you say Amen
[1:23:52] that's right that's why the pastor
[1:23:54] doesn't do it
[1:23:56] all he God didn't ordain the pastor to
[1:24:00] be the trustee and the Deacon and the
[1:24:02] and and and the you know the sound guy
[1:24:06] and the one that's always the one
[1:24:08] prophesying and you know and and and um
[1:24:12] um speaking in tongues and and
[1:24:15] interpreting prophecy and and all that
[1:24:17] these are gifts to the
[1:24:19] church amen praise the Lord and can you
[1:24:22] say amen
[1:24:24] amen now Bible History teaches us that
[1:24:27] every time God gives a visitation of the
[1:24:30] Holy
[1:24:31] Spirit and the people get free it
[1:24:33] doesn't take long before they bind
[1:24:36] themselves back to what they came out
[1:24:39] of and and and we know and we're seeing
[1:24:43] it right before us that every
[1:24:44] denomination every
[1:24:46] organization is going back to to the
[1:24:50] mother
[1:24:51] Harlot the they're they're all going
[1:24:53] back and joining themselves with the
[1:24:55] Catholic Church ain't that right and
[1:24:57] brother you know the Bible calls her the
[1:25:00] mother of harlots and John spoke of her
[1:25:03] in Revelation 17 and5 as being mystery
[1:25:06] babblin the great the mother of harlots
[1:25:09] and Abominations of the earth see so now
[1:25:13] we know by the message that the harlots
[1:25:15] are these
[1:25:16] denominations they they didn't come what
[1:25:20] didn't receive that same experience as
[1:25:23] as Pentecost did baptized into the body
[1:25:26] can you say amen God started his church
[1:25:29] on the day of Pentecost a ain't that
[1:25:31] right amen see Satan bypassed Pentecost
[1:25:35] amen and started his church there see so
[1:25:39] he says see the harlots uh he saids see
[1:25:42] they set as the word aside deny the work
[1:25:45] of the spirit of God subjugate the leoty
[1:25:49] and make it impossible for the leoty to
[1:25:51] worship God unless they come through
[1:25:53] them or through their pattern which is
[1:25:56] nothing but a blueprint of unbelief from
[1:25:59] Satan himself can you say Amen so we we
[1:26:03] look of how far the church has wandered
[1:26:06] and I again I'm I'm I'm speaking of a
[1:26:09] false Vine of how that it is wandered uh
[1:26:12] so far from from uh the the the first
[1:26:16] church uh there at Pentecost and brother
[1:26:20] Braham say see Pentecost is nowhere View
[1:26:23] and the word cannot be found Trinity
[1:26:25] cannot be found in the word of God do
[1:26:29] you believe that see Apostolic
[1:26:32] succession is cannot be found in the
[1:26:34] word of God Amen shaking a preacher's
[1:26:37] hand or to be saved as a way of
[1:26:40] Salvation or joining uh writing your
[1:26:42] name on belonging to a church and and
[1:26:45] and putting your name on the roll
[1:26:48] there's nowhere in the word of God for
[1:26:51] that to be the means of us making it to
[1:26:54] Heaven Can you say Amen formalism is not
[1:26:58] in the word of God a dead lifeless
[1:27:00] religion is not found in the word of God
[1:27:05] a powerless religion is not found in the
[1:27:09] word of God accepting emotions as a way
[1:27:12] of spirituality is not found in the word
[1:27:16] of God when it uh uh because you know uh
[1:27:21] uh people have these emotions and things
[1:27:23] and yet they deny the very fact of
[1:27:26] having an experience of the baptism of
[1:27:29] the Holy Ghost and that's not found in
[1:27:31] the word of God can you say Amen so we
[1:27:35] find that that that formalism started in
[1:27:38] the first church age amen by the
[1:27:41] so-called apostles who had only a form
[1:27:44] of godliness and notice what the prophet
[1:27:46] said they began to break to kind of
[1:27:48] break down the people under the
[1:27:50] inspiration of the Holy Ghost
[1:27:52] and began to cause people to kind of
[1:27:54] make fun of them so their their whole
[1:27:57] motive was to turn the people against
[1:28:00] the true elect that really had a true
[1:28:04] baptism of the Holy Ghost a man that
[1:28:06] moved under the leadership of the Holy
[1:28:09] Ghost hello amen they they they believed
[1:28:12] in the gifts Paul says this in there
[1:28:14] they believed in in tongues they
[1:28:16] believed in interpretation of tongues
[1:28:18] and they done it under Paul's Ministry
[1:28:21] where he set the church in order amen
[1:28:23] and they they they were led by the
[1:28:26] spirit they moved under the spirit and
[1:28:28] this this false Vine moved the people
[1:28:32] away from that and to where they began
[1:28:34] to make fun of it it's happening
[1:28:39] again
[1:28:41] so these men who claim to be apostles
[1:28:44] were not and they were proven to be
[1:28:46] Liars can you say Amen now if you notice
[1:28:50] that happened in the first church age
[1:28:52] but look in the second Church age God
[1:28:55] exposes the blasphemy of those who say
[1:28:58] they are Jews and are not and God said
[1:29:01] they are the synagogue of Satan see so
[1:29:05] now now uh again just uh taking it from
[1:29:08] the church age uh Church ages here the
[1:29:11] word Jews does not describe the religion
[1:29:14] of the Jewish people it only refers to
[1:29:16] the Jewish people and has the same
[1:29:19] meaning as you know me being American
[1:29:21] born see so these people were saying
[1:29:24] that they were real true Jews by birth
[1:29:28] and and they were not and they were not
[1:29:30] Jews by religion either brother brand
[1:29:33] says what it is they were a deceit
[1:29:35] people who were already part of the
[1:29:38] church they belonged to the false Vine
[1:29:42] oh can you say Amen so they were not of
[1:29:44] the true church for God says they were
[1:29:46] the synagogue of Satan now notice now
[1:29:50] the the word synagogue
[1:29:52] it doesn't have the same meaning as the
[1:29:54] word church for the word church means
[1:29:57] called out ones summonsed ones ain't
[1:30:01] that right see this is where uh uh Psalm
[1:30:05] 654 it says blessed is the man whom thou
[1:30:09] choosest and causest to approach unto
[1:30:12] thee that he may dwell in thy courts
[1:30:15] that's the Church of the Living God
[1:30:18] that's the body of of of Christ ain't
[1:30:21] that right who makes up that body of
[1:30:23] Christ those that have been called out
[1:30:25] by God those that have been summonsed by
[1:30:28] God but this of a synagogue he says see
[1:30:32] it's a synagogue of Satan well synagogue
[1:30:35] is just a assembly or a gathering see
[1:30:39] not not a not a calling out not not a
[1:30:43] summons it's just they're gathered there
[1:30:46] they're they're assembled there which
[1:30:48] can be good and and it can be bad see uh
[1:30:52] uh but in this case uh uh the assembling
[1:30:55] of this people is bad for they are an
[1:30:59] assembly of Satan they are a gathering
[1:31:02] of their own selves can you say Amen
[1:31:05] this Gathering of them is not of God God
[1:31:08] didn't call them God didn't summons them
[1:31:12] they just came and gathered and were of
[1:31:15] the synagogue of Satan now this is
[1:31:18] exactly what Isaiah
[1:31:20] 54:15 uh uh uh said here behold they
[1:31:25] Shall Gather surely gather together but
[1:31:28] not by me can you say man they will
[1:31:32] gather together but not by me whosoever
[1:31:35] Shall Gather together against thee shall
[1:31:38] fall for thy sake so in the first church
[1:31:42] age and then now the second Church age
[1:31:44] this synagogue of Satan was the
[1:31:46] Gathering of the
[1:31:48] nicians ain't that right see so in the
[1:31:51] first church Church age there were those
[1:31:53] who were saying that they were Apostles
[1:31:55] but were proven to be lying in the
[1:31:58] second Church age there were those who
[1:32:00] were claiming to be Jews of in religion
[1:32:03] see and and these things but they were
[1:32:05] not so they were lying now now notice
[1:32:09] amen uh uh who who is the father of
[1:32:14] Lies isn't that what Jesus said the
[1:32:16] devil Satan is the father of Lies so
[1:32:20] then then it's not strange me that those
[1:32:23] who are part of his synagogue that
[1:32:25] Gathering are liars as well there's no
[1:32:30] truth in
[1:32:32] him you know I looked up the word Li it
[1:32:35] means to speak deliberate falsehoods to
[1:32:38] deceive one by a lie so brother Braham
[1:32:41] said see who who is it that shall
[1:32:43] attempt to deceive the very elect why
[1:32:46] the spirit of antichrist in the false
[1:32:48] anointed ones of this last day these
[1:32:50] false ones have already come in jesus'
[1:32:53] name claiming that they have been
[1:32:54] anointed of God for the last day they
[1:32:57] are false Messiahs anointed ones they
[1:33:00] claim that they are prophets but but are
[1:33:02] they one with the word never right have
[1:33:06] they added to or taken from it see see
[1:33:10] so no one denies that the spirit of God
[1:33:12] manifesting in gifts is upon them but
[1:33:16] like balam they have they they all have
[1:33:18] their programs make their appeal for
[1:33:21] money exercise gift but deny the word or
[1:33:25] bypass it for fear that a controversy
[1:33:28] might diminish their chances for greater
[1:33:30] gain yet they preach salvation and
[1:33:33] deliverance through the power of God
[1:33:35] just like Judas with the ministry
[1:33:37] imparted by Christ but because they are
[1:33:40] wrong seed consequently they have a
[1:33:43] wrong Spirit motivating them religious
[1:33:46] oh my they outshine the elect in effort
[1:33:48] and Zeal but it is leot ofan and not of
[1:33:53] Christ for it looks for big crowds big
[1:33:55] programs startling signs among them see
[1:33:58] they preach the second coming of Christ
[1:34:00] but deny the Advent of a prophet
[1:34:02] messenger though in power and signs and
[1:34:05] true Revelation he Eclipse them all see
[1:34:09] ah yes this false spirit that in the
[1:34:12] last days is so close to the real and
[1:34:15] can only be distinguished by its
[1:34:18] deviation from the word and when ever it
[1:34:22] is caught in being anti- word it falls
[1:34:24] back on the one argument we've already
[1:34:27] shown to be false we get results don't
[1:34:29] we so we have to be of God yeah that's
[1:34:32] what they
[1:34:33] say now second Timothy 3
[1:34:38] and3 Paul would write and say but evil
[1:34:42] men and seducers shall wax worse and
[1:34:45] worse deceiving and being
[1:34:47] deceiving being deceived but continue
[1:34:51] that th everybody say continue
[1:34:54] thou continue thou in the things which
[1:34:57] thou Hast learned and H has been assured
[1:35:00] of knowing amen of whom thou Hast
[1:35:04] learned them amen knowing of whom yes
[1:35:09] that makes a difference
[1:35:10] amen now God
[1:35:14] allows them to
[1:35:17] deceive
[1:35:19] and I'm
[1:35:21] reminded of the time that Ahab and
[1:35:24] Jehoshaphat made an alliance together
[1:35:27] and Jehoshaphat wanted to know if they
[1:35:29] should go to war or not and want to know
[1:35:32] what was going on he kind of felt a
[1:35:33] little uneasy so he asked Ahab you have
[1:35:37] someone you know to to tell us what we
[1:35:40] should do so Ahab
[1:35:42] got his 400 prophets right now God's
[1:35:47] looking upon this assembly God's looking
[1:35:50] on this Gathering
[1:35:54] and we we find that that they the the
[1:35:57] 400 Prophet said go up go up go up God's
[1:36:00] with you yes God's given us the
[1:36:02] land and and and Jehoshaphat been
[1:36:05] halfway spiritual says H that don't
[1:36:08] sound right you have any anyone else
[1:36:12] yeah any true prophet and he well I got
[1:36:15] one he's in prison he said but he he
[1:36:17] always speaks bad of me I don't like him
[1:36:22] well I I I I ain't going to move until
[1:36:24] you send him I want to hear what he has
[1:36:27] to say you know so Micaiah you know the
[1:36:30] the guard told him says now everybody's
[1:36:32] telling him to go up go up you say the
[1:36:34] same thing you know if if you want to
[1:36:37] live and you want to prosper in your
[1:36:38] ministry you know and so he uh he well I
[1:36:42] can only say what the Lord puts in my
[1:36:43] mouth and so uh Mah goes up there going
[1:36:47] up going up yay the Lord's with you
[1:36:49] going up you know and and King's like
[1:36:52] heab like all right come on man now we
[1:36:54] all both know you've never agreed with
[1:36:56] anything I do you know so I don't
[1:36:59] understand why you're doing this now
[1:37:00] what do you really got to say about it
[1:37:03] right and notice notice the in First
[1:37:06] Kings 22 and
[1:37:08] 19 the prophet Micaiah says Hear thou
[1:37:11] therefore the word of the Lord I Saw the
[1:37:13] Lord sitting on his throne and all the
[1:37:16] hosts of Heaven standing by him on his
[1:37:18] right hand and on his left and the Lord
[1:37:20] said who shall persuade Ahab that he may
[1:37:24] go up and fall at rth Gilead and one
[1:37:27] said on this manner and another said on
[1:37:29] that manner and there came forth the
[1:37:31] spirit and stood before the Lord and
[1:37:33] says I will persuade him and the Lord
[1:37:35] said unto him how how you going to do
[1:37:37] this and he said well I'll go forth and
[1:37:39] I'll be a lying spirit in the mouth of
[1:37:41] all of his prophets and he said Thou
[1:37:44] shalt persuade him and Prevail that's
[1:37:47] right go forth and do so ain't that
[1:37:50] right yeah so if you notice that lying
[1:37:53] Spirit could
[1:37:56] not get on that true Prophet amen for
[1:38:00] the word of the Lord only comes to a
[1:38:02] prophet amen amen but he says I'll get
[1:38:05] on all of his prophets ahab's
[1:38:08] prophets and so there there were
[1:38:11] prophets that were that were ahab's
[1:38:13] which were inspired of the devil that
[1:38:15] that aying Spirit came on him them to
[1:38:19] deceive Ahab right ain't that right see
[1:38:23] and so so here we find you know one
[1:38:26] might think that it'd be unfair that
[1:38:28] that God would send a lying Spirit to
[1:38:30] deceive
[1:38:32] Ahab but notice the true story God sent
[1:38:36] Ahab a true Prophet first yeah
[1:38:41] Elijah and Ahab wouldn't listen to that
[1:38:45] man right he he listened to his
[1:38:49] wife that was a The
[1:38:52] Jezebel yeah and and so you know uh
[1:38:58] uh the word of the Lord would come to
[1:39:01] Elijah and and and he would give it to
[1:39:04] Ahab and Ahab would do totally different
[1:39:06] he didn't care ain't that right see and
[1:39:10] and and so even it was in his heart uh
[1:39:13] as as I told you you know there in First
[1:39:15] Kings 22 and8 Ahab said of this Prophet
[1:39:19] mcka I hate him for he do not prophesy
[1:39:21] good concerning me but evil the truth
[1:39:24] was evil to
[1:39:26] him every time that true Prophet would
[1:39:29] speak the word of the Lord Ahab would
[1:39:31] see it as evil instead of saying you
[1:39:34] know that is the truth I Repent I humble
[1:39:36] myself I turn around my evil ways they
[1:39:39] looked he looked at it as he's always
[1:39:41] striking against me he's always
[1:39:43] preaching at me he's always trying to
[1:39:45] destroy him he hates me no it's the word
[1:39:48] of the
[1:39:49] Lord that's right
[1:39:52] right so then to keep from having to
[1:39:54] hear the voice of God he tries to
[1:39:57] silence him by throwing him in prison
[1:40:00] and so is it today God has sent a
[1:40:03] prophet in this age but the world has
[1:40:05] rejected the voice of the Lord therefore
[1:40:08] he has sent a lying
[1:40:10] Spirit to deceive the world can you say
[1:40:14] Amen you look at it 2 Thessalonians 2
[1:40:18] and7 for the mystery of iniquity doth
[1:40:20] already work only he who now lth will
[1:40:23] let until he speaking of the Bride be
[1:40:25] taken out of the way you say well that's
[1:40:27] a he there not a she well the prophet
[1:40:30] said she is
[1:40:31] him ain't that right identifying who she
[1:40:35] really is right then shall that Wicked
[1:40:39] be revealed whom the Lord shall consume
[1:40:41] with the spirit of his mouth and shall
[1:40:43] destroy with the brightness of his
[1:40:45] coming even him who's coming is after
[1:40:47] the working of Satan with all power
[1:40:49] signs and lines wonders and with all
[1:40:52] deceivableness of unrighteousness in
[1:40:55] them that perish because they receive
[1:40:57] not the love of the truth that they
[1:40:59] might be saved for this cause shall God
[1:41:02] send them strong delusion that they
[1:41:04] should believe a lie and that they all
[1:41:07] might be damned who believe not the
[1:41:08] truth but had pleasure in
[1:41:12] unrighteousness how awful would it be to
[1:41:14] attend church and yet be Anointed with
[1:41:17] the spirit of deception right amen or to
[1:41:21] read the Bible and the spirit of
[1:41:22] deception interpret it to you thank God
[1:41:25] for a
[1:41:27] prophet and thank God for a heart to
[1:41:29] believe what a prophet
[1:41:31] said Thank God to be able to Humble
[1:41:35] ourselves say God if you said it it's
[1:41:38] there then can you say Amen not that I
[1:41:42] would stand and the judge a prophet for
[1:41:45] the prophet said no man judged a prophet
[1:41:48] Isaiah never stood there to be judged by
[1:41:51] man right his word was to judge
[1:41:54] men can you say Amen so brother Bram
[1:41:58] said see so many people are listening to
[1:42:00] enticing Spirits instead of taking the
[1:42:02] word of God Spirits they're in the world
[1:42:04] they're demons and they go out into
[1:42:06] places and they get amongst men
[1:42:08] ministers they get amongst church
[1:42:10] members they get amongst good people and
[1:42:12] they cause them to come into an illusion
[1:42:14] and they say things and do things and
[1:42:16] teach things and practice things that's
[1:42:18] contrary to the word of of
[1:42:23] God I think everything that I've said
[1:42:26] here makes this bride shine so much
[1:42:30] greater am for there's only one people
[1:42:33] that cannot be deceived and that's the
[1:42:35] elect amen can you say amen
[1:42:39] amen now not to keep you much longer but
[1:42:43] having a Ministry is important
[1:42:46] amen
[1:42:48] but being a part of the body of Christ
[1:42:52] is even more important the Lord can you
[1:42:55] say amen amen being positionally placed
[1:42:58] in that body and we know that by one
[1:43:01] Spirit we're all baptized into one body
[1:43:04] but a man can have a Ministry and not be
[1:43:07] in that body yeah Judas had a Ministry
[1:43:11] did yes he did but he did not go to
[1:43:15] Pentecost and that's where he failed he
[1:43:18] showed his colors at p cost can you say
[1:43:21] amen amen so then we find that the body
[1:43:24] is the Church of the Living God it's not
[1:43:27] a group of people that is just
[1:43:30] assembling themselves but it's a people
[1:43:33] that have been called out and
[1:43:36] summonsed aren't you glad you've been
[1:43:38] called yes sir you've been summoned amen
[1:43:41] you're an elect of
[1:43:43] God see here at Faith
[1:43:46] Tabernacle anyone can
[1:43:49] come
[1:43:52] anyone can assemble themselves here the
[1:43:55] make believer the unbeliever the True
[1:43:56] Believer it's it's it's everyone sure
[1:44:00] that sits can sit here this morning or
[1:44:02] wherever can you say amen and anything
[1:44:06] can gather the make believer and the
[1:44:08] unbeliever brother BR said some come to
[1:44:11] criticize some come just to make fun
[1:44:14] some come out of curiosity some come uh
[1:44:19] you know because they they they they
[1:44:20] don't want to you know go to hell some
[1:44:24] they they they come for all reasons can
[1:44:27] you say Amen but notice but the church
[1:44:30] the bride is United by one God under one
[1:44:36] Spirit the spirit of God in whole one
[1:44:40] holy Union of God to be one holy bride
[1:44:44] to God that's right all together unify
[1:44:50] un of the
[1:44:52] bodyall the body waiting as a bride as

[1:44:59] bride for the uniting time of the Bride
[1:45:02] the church is so coming together it
[1:45:05] should create just a love Among Us that
[1:45:08] we could hardly be away from one another
[1:45:11] that's right see when you just see you
[1:45:13] don't have to beg people to pray you
[1:45:15] don't have to beg them amen to worship
[1:45:18] God you don't have to beg them to do
[1:45:20] what's right they're just so in love
[1:45:22] with him tell there's nothing else
[1:45:24] that's the body of
[1:45:28] Christ they're under a headship amen
[1:45:32] that's right it ain't gifts that we
[1:45:34] worry about it's not Ministry that we
[1:45:37] worry about the lord it's relationship
[1:45:41] with God that we worry about it's
[1:45:43] getting ourselves in such a contract
[1:45:46] condition to where we can be sensitive
[1:45:48] to his leadership amen that's the body
[1:45:51] of Christ cuz they're under headship
[1:45:53] he's the one that's going to take care
[1:45:55] of them he promised you know you see all
[1:45:58] these guys getting so caught up in these
[1:46:01] politics sad the same message people do
[1:46:05] it get caught up in politics as if the
[1:46:08] life will be better for them didn't your
[1:46:10] headship of the body that we claim to be
[1:46:13] part of already promised he'd supply all
[1:46:15] of our
[1:46:16] needs according to his riches and Glory
[1:46:19] not Trump's riches
[1:46:21] not Biden's riches under his
[1:46:25] riches can you say Amen remember when
[1:46:28] the king of the the kings of the earth
[1:46:30] wanted to bless Abraham and bestow
[1:46:33] riches upon him and he says no I don't
[1:46:35] want I don't want nothing of
[1:46:37] you he is my true
[1:46:40] reward he is my shield and
[1:46:43] buckler can you say Amen see so our
[1:46:47] headship is Christ he promises to supply
[1:46:52] all of our
[1:46:54] needs he's the one that said I am the
[1:46:57] god that Health
[1:47:00] thee can you say
[1:47:03] amen and if you notice what gathers that
[1:47:06] elect God is always in His prophets to
[1:47:10] gather the
[1:47:10] [Applause]
[1:47:12] elect amen look at Noah he gathered that
[1:47:17] little group yes amen from the rest of
[1:47:20] the
[1:47:21] world and he was willing to be called
[1:47:24] all kinds of names but it didn't matter
[1:47:27] amen God would send him to gather that
[1:47:31] people ain't that right Moses gathered
[1:47:34] them Paul
[1:47:37] gathered aren't you glad for that amen
[1:47:41] Church represents woman as we know and
[1:47:44] of course that Faline Satan Synagogue
[1:47:48] Church is at harlot
[1:47:51] system that ill
[1:47:55] famed what mother mother
[1:47:58] Harlot but the Bible calls the Church
[1:48:01] the true church the elect lady amen
[1:48:04] think of that that's right that that
[1:48:07] Gathering of her her she she's so
[1:48:11] gathered by a summons that that
[1:48:14] that the writer would recognize her not
[1:48:18] just the church but the elect
[1:48:21] lady the prophet called her missgrace
[1:48:25] yes sir praise the Lord that's right
[1:48:28] Amen brother BR said she is called the
[1:48:30] elected lady because among all the women
[1:48:33] she was chosen amen ain't that right
[1:48:37] like God chose Mary a virgin girl to
[1:48:40] bring forth the body of God upon the
[1:48:42] Earth so the church is the elected lady
[1:48:45] which is the bride of Christ to produce
[1:48:48] Christ can you say amen amen and so
[1:48:52] every individual that makes up this body
[1:48:54] is elected called
[1:48:57] Chosen and she been baptized by one
[1:49:00] Spirit into this one body and the new
[1:49:03] birth that has come to you is not by
[1:49:05] your your own works not what you have
[1:49:08] merited not what you have deserved but
[1:49:10] by God's
[1:49:12] election God foreordained to give you
[1:49:14] the Holy Ghost before you was ever born
[1:49:17] he he knew that can you say amen he
[1:49:20] ordained it so it wasn't that that that
[1:49:22] you just happened to stumble into this
[1:49:25] message God ordained you for this
[1:49:28] time God ordained you to be part of this
[1:49:32] body there's going to be somebody on
[1:49:34] this Earth that reflect the word of
[1:49:37] God can you say amen amen so being that
[1:49:42] the woman represents the church brother
[1:49:45] Braham says then we can watch the
[1:49:47] conditions and the conduct of women and
[1:49:49] you'll see where where the church is if
[1:49:51] you'll see the conduct of women in the
[1:49:53] world today watch the conduct of the
[1:49:55] worldly church today when you see women
[1:49:58] go just go on the Rampage just doing
[1:49:59] anything they want to do see uh watch
[1:50:03] the church is doing the same thing
[1:50:05] that's right it's rare for women to
[1:50:08] submit under headship today that's right
[1:50:10] amen they first of all they want to
[1:50:12] shack up together don't want to get
[1:50:13] married because of no com commitments
[1:50:16] amen hello true then when they do to get
[1:50:19] married they don't want no headship
[1:50:20] going to do my own thing husband does
[1:50:22] his own thing that is not the way God
[1:50:25] ordained a marriage to
[1:50:27] be can you say Amen but it's becoming
[1:50:31] more common among the women of the world
[1:50:32] today because there's a church just
[1:50:34] exactly like
[1:50:36] her yes headship has come and she's
[1:50:39] refused A headship amen that's true
[1:50:41] that's right see but watch brother Bram
[1:50:44] says see when the spiritual bride when
[1:50:46] she becomes to begins to have a Revival
[1:50:49] when she begins to come back and line
[1:50:51] herself up with the word of God watch
[1:50:53] that little
[1:50:54] bride watch that little lady that's what
[1:50:58] you sisters
[1:51:03] represent don't compete with the world
[1:51:08] ladies don't let that Spirit of the
[1:51:11] world get on you amen amen cuz remember
[1:51:14] what a prophet said they're representing
[1:51:16] a worldly Church you're representing
[1:51:18] God's Church that spiritual bride amen
[1:51:22] can you say amen he says then watch then
[1:51:25] again how you see that scripture how
[1:51:28] that the scriptures at that time there
[1:51:30] will be a message everybody say there
[1:51:31] will be a message sweep out to catch
[1:51:34] that bride to catch that woman elect and
[1:51:37] have we not received that
[1:51:39] message yes we have we've received it
[1:51:42] it's Gathering Gathering can you say
[1:51:45] amen amen do you love the Lord am amen
[1:51:48] you know the first woman
[1:51:50] there Eve she was a prefigure of the
[1:51:53] church today as to where she come from
[1:51:57] as to who she was and what Spirit was in
[1:51:59] her amen and Genesis 1:26 says and God
[1:52:05] said let us make man in our image after
[1:52:07] our
[1:52:07] likeness the 27th verse says so God
[1:52:11] created man in his own image and in the
[1:52:13] image of God created he him male and
[1:52:15] female created he them so man in his
[1:52:18] Spirit was both f fine and
[1:52:21] masculine Genesis 2:7 and the Lord God
[1:52:24] formed Man Out of the Dust of the Dust
[1:52:28] of the ground and breathe into his
[1:52:30] nostrils the breath of life and man
[1:52:31] become a living Soul 18th verse and the
[1:52:35] Lord God said it is not good that the
[1:52:37] man should be alone I will make him a
[1:52:40] help meat for him you realize that's
[1:52:43] that's that's what the church is to be
[1:52:45] is an help
[1:52:46] meate to the Lord Jesus the Lord his
[1:52:49] Ministry carrying on his ministry his
[1:52:52] work 21st verse and the Lord God cused
[1:52:55] the Deep Sleep to fall upon Adam and he
[1:52:57] slept and God took one of his ribs and
[1:53:00] closed up the flesh instead thereof and
[1:53:03] the rib which the Lord God had taken
[1:53:05] from man made he a woman and brought her
[1:53:07] unto the man and Adam said this is now
[1:53:10] bone of my bone Flesh of My Flesh and
[1:53:12] she shall be called woman because she
[1:53:14] was taken out of
[1:53:16] man right she was Adam right her name
[1:53:20] was Adam a that right amen now we know
[1:53:24] that the natural Eve fell but God
[1:53:27] purposed within himself to bring forth a
[1:53:30] spiritual Eve that would never fall
[1:53:33] never fall can you say amen amen amen
[1:53:35] but the only way he could get her and
[1:53:38] bring her into
[1:53:40] existence is he had to come himself as
[1:53:43] bridegroom
[1:53:45] Hallelujah and now we have come out of
[1:53:48] him left of Flesh word of his word power
[1:53:51] of his power Spirit of his Spirit see
[1:53:54] God when he made that woman he did not
[1:53:58] take anything outside of Adam he brought
[1:54:00] it into from Adam and he divided the
[1:54:03] spirit of Adam divided the masculine
[1:54:06] part and took the feminist part of Adam
[1:54:09] and put it in the woman ain't that
[1:54:12] right and this is why the body of Christ
[1:54:15] has to have the very same spirit
[1:54:20] as
[1:54:22] Christ amen because God promised in this
[1:54:25] age to take a people
[1:54:27] out of the Gentiles for his name prise
[1:54:30] the Lord you do you're not an accident
[1:54:33] when God promised to take a people out
[1:54:36] of the Gentiles for his name he had you
[1:54:38] in mind amen you're that elect lady yes
[1:54:42] sir I believe can you say Amen you're
[1:54:44] not just a person with
[1:54:47] gifts you're not just a person with the
[1:54:49] healing campaign working miracles
[1:54:52] prophesying speaking in tongues and all
[1:54:54] these
[1:54:55] things but you're one that is subject to
[1:54:58] all of these gifts in the body under
[1:55:01] headship
[1:55:03] amen and that body is the word body word
[1:55:06] body can you say Amen Lord you love the
[1:55:08] Lord amen amen so we have those that you
[1:55:13] know that yeah they're they're working
[1:55:15] things they're doing things it's around
[1:55:18] the world but they're without a headship
[1:55:21] because they've not been in the body if
[1:55:23] the musicians will come thank God for
[1:55:26] that headship
[1:55:28] amen the prophet said we've come through
[1:55:30] a day of churchianity we've come we've
[1:55:32] had just enough light to believe on him
[1:55:34] to accept Christ join Church build our
[1:55:39] organizations but Zechariah 14:7 says in
[1:55:42] the evening time it shall be
[1:55:46] light and brother Bram says what is it
[1:55:48] what what is that scripture talking
[1:55:50] about which we know that this scripture
[1:55:52] is is is for our day but he said it's
[1:55:55] god making up his bride
[1:55:58] Body by pouring out the same evidence on
[1:56:01] the western people that was poured out
[1:56:03] on the Eastern people
[1:56:05] yes the same power the same things that
[1:56:10] was poured out in the Eastern is now
[1:56:13] poured out upon the
[1:56:15] Western and God took the
[1:56:17] rib Prophet said under Adam from under
[1:56:20] Adam's side and he made Eve out of it so
[1:56:23] he did the same thing taken out of the
[1:56:25] sight of Christ the blood and water and
[1:56:28] Christ is the word and is taking the
[1:56:31] word and making up his church eeve
[1:56:34] aren't you glad for that I love the
[1:56:37] Lord and what has she been identified
[1:56:40] not just as a church
[1:56:42] anymore but she's been identified as
[1:56:44] Miss Jesus Christ
[1:56:46] amen bone of his bone flesh of his his
[1:56:50] flesh I hope that we can see the
[1:56:55] position that we are
[1:56:57] in by being part of the body of
[1:57:01] Christ being that word body see you
[1:57:04] don't have to come out from under the
[1:57:06] word to be
[1:57:08] something actually when you come out
[1:57:10] from under the word Satan's got you and
[1:57:12] then it's death then it doesn't matter
[1:57:15] if you prophesy speak in tongues see
[1:57:17] Visions see angels whatever if you come
[1:57:20] out from under the
[1:57:22] word then then it it is no effect at all
[1:57:26] amen true we would rather be under the
[1:57:29] headship of the word and be under the
[1:57:32] inspiration of the word be under the
[1:57:34] dictates of the word
[1:57:36] right everything lined up with the the
[1:57:39] word the church lined up with the word
[1:57:41] our homes Our lives our ministry
[1:57:44] everything our gifts everything that is
[1:57:47] done let it be lined up with the word of
[1:57:49] God want amen can you say am man
[1:57:52] amen you know when you think
[1:57:56] of the Pentecost and you think
[1:58:00] of the churches in the nominal and
[1:58:02] things it looks like maybe we're not
[1:58:04] just doing much at
[1:58:06] all God's bride just doesn't seem to be
[1:58:09] doing much which first of
[1:58:11] all the prophet of God says that this
[1:58:13] revival Brides Revival won't be a public
[1:58:15] show that's
[1:58:18] right
[1:58:20] but it seemed like maybe they're they're
[1:58:22] they're they're they're doing circles
[1:58:24] around this little bride that's
[1:58:26] okay but one thing about it is we're
[1:58:29] under a
[1:58:30] headship can you sayen I'd rather be
[1:58:33] under headship doing his will then to be
[1:58:36] one that goes up there and says Lord
[1:58:37] have I not prophesied in thy name have
[1:58:39] we not cast out devils in thy name have
[1:58:41] we not done this and have we not done
[1:58:42] that and then he turns around and says
[1:58:44] but depart from me you workers of
[1:58:45] iniquity I never knew you all right can
[1:58:48] you amen amen I'd rather be the one that
[1:58:52] whatever we do it really
[1:58:55] counts that God says that's my approval
[1:58:59] I approve
[1:59:00] that amen you love the Lord yes sir amen
[1:59:04] trust it was a help to you some way or
[1:59:07] another amen but what song are we

[2:08:28] as we're seeing the current of life that
[2:08:31] is sweeping the
[2:08:33] people like never before away from the
[2:08:36] word and it's not just that it's people
[2:08:40] becoming more hardened to the gospel yes
[2:08:44] where the the the the gospel can't
[2:08:47] penetrate people as it used to that's
[2:08:50] right but yet we stand here and we could
[2:08:54] listen to the
[2:08:58] message and be so touched by it God can
[2:09:02] deal with our hearts
[2:09:05] amen when we see that we're wrong God
[2:09:07] can correct us and we repent it's it's
[2:09:10] not just something we take lightly

[2:09:15] us I always just ask the Lord that God
[2:09:20] would never let me lose my
[2:09:21] convictions that God will never let me
[2:09:25] lose the value of his
[2:09:29] word let me always appreciate it let me
[2:09:31] always be able to humble myself to it
[2:09:34] never to seek my own ways seek my own
[2:09:38] Ministry my own
[2:09:39] ideas but let it be that I could
[2:09:41] surrender to God and I think that's the
[2:09:44] act of grace of God Upon Our Lives amen
[2:09:48] for or as Paul would say I am what I am
[2:09:50] by the grace of God he never exalted

[2:09:56] accomplishment amen It Was Always by the
