[15:34] Oh,
[15:36] he's got it all
[15:38] in control.
[15:49] Praise the Lord. Going to sing this
[15:51] song. I think it fits us all. It's an
[15:54] old song that um I don't know
[16:03] I've had many tears and sorrow.
[16:08] I've had questions for tomorrow.
[16:12] There's been times I didn't know right
[16:15] from wrong.
[16:20] But in every situation,
[16:24] God gave me blessed consolation
[16:28] that my trials would only make me
[16:32] strong.
[16:35] Oh, through it all,
[16:40] through it all,
[16:43] I've learned to trust in Jesus.
[16:48] I've learned to trust in God.
[16:52] Through it all,
[16:56] through it all,
[17:00] I've learned to depend upon my Lord.
[17:07] Now, I've been to a lot of places.
[17:12] I've seen lots of faces.
[17:16] But there were times I felt so all
[17:19] alone.
[17:23] But in my lonely hours,
[17:27] Jesus lonely hours, Jesus lets me know
[17:32] that I am his own.
[17:37] Oh, through it all.
[17:42] Through it all.
[17:45] Oh, I've learned to trust in Jesus.
[17:49] I've learned to trust in God.
[17:53] Through it all,
[17:57] through it all,
[18:01] I've learned to depend upon his word.
[18:08] Oh, I thank him for the mountains.
[18:13] I thank him for the valleys.
[18:16] I thank him for the storms he's brought
[18:20] me through.
[18:23] For if I'd never had a trial, I wouldn't
[18:28] know God could solve them. I wouldn't
[18:32] know what faith in God can do.
[18:37] I want to say that through it all,
[18:42] through it all,
[18:45] I've learned to trust in Jesus.
[18:49] I've learned to trust in God. Oh,
[18:53] through it all,
[18:57] through it all,
[19:00] I've learned to depend upon his word.
[19:05] Can you sing it with me? Oh, now I thank
[19:08] him for the mountains.
[19:12] I thank him for the valleys.
[19:15] I thank him for every storm he's brought
[19:19] me through.
[19:22] For if I'd never had a problem, I
[19:27] wouldn't know that God could solve them.
[19:30] I wouldn't know what faith in God can
[19:34] do.
[19:36] Oh, but through it all,
[19:41] through it all,
[19:44] I've learned to trust in Jesus.
[19:48] I've learned to trust in God.
[19:52] Through it all,
[19:55] oh through it all,
[19:59] I've learned to depend upon his word.
[20:05] Oh, I've learned to depend upon
[20:11] his word.
[20:24] Amen. Amen.
[20:27] Jesus,
[20:30] we're depending on you.
[20:34] Yes, Jesus,
[20:38] we're depending on you. Oh, Jesus,
[20:45] we're depending on you, Lord. depending
[20:49] on you
[20:52] to see us through.
[20:55] When they came to the waters,
[20:58] they didn't know what to do.
[21:02] There was no one to help them. They
[21:06] couldn't see their way through. Oh, but
[21:09] Lord, you move the waters
[21:12] and they walked right on through. Oh
[21:16] Jesus, we're depending on you.
[21:21] Oh yes, Jesus,
[21:26] we're depending on you.
[21:29] Oh Jesus,
[21:33] we're depending on you. Yes,
[21:37] Jesus,
[21:40] we're depending on you, Lord. We're
[21:44] depending on you, oh, to see us through.
[21:50] Now, when our faith tried by fire,
[21:53] we still know that it's true.
[21:57] Oh, the Satan is a liar,
[22:00] there isn't much that he can do.
[22:04] And though he's tried to stop us, we
[22:08] know you'll bring us through. Oh Jesus,
[22:12] we're depending on you. Can you stand
[22:15] and sing it now? Oh yes, Jesus.
[22:20] Oh, we're depending on you. Yes, Jesus.
[22:27] We're depending on you. Oh
[22:31] Jesus,
[22:34] we're depending on you, Lord. depending
[22:39] on you. Oh, to see us through. Yes,
[22:45] Jesus,
[22:48] we're depending on you. You depending on
[22:51] him, oh Jesus,
[22:54] we're depending on you. Oh Jesus,
[23:01] we're depending on you, Lord. We're
[23:05] depending on you, oh, to see us through.
[23:12] Can you give the Lord another hand clap
[23:14] of praise tonight?
[23:16] Are you glad that he's our way maker
[23:18] tonight?
[23:20] Amen. Amen. As we invite Brother Terry
[23:23] to come, can we sing that song? This is
[23:26] the evening time.
[23:29] Oh, this is the evening
[23:33] time.
[23:36] It's later than we think.
[23:42] Oh, the bride is preparing
[23:46] now
[23:47] for her Lord to meet.
[23:55] Oh, all things are ready now.
[24:01] The bridegroom I hear.
[24:08] Oh, ye the hath an ear to hear
[24:13] the evening time is here.
[24:19] Oh yes, this is the
[24:27] later than we think it is.
[24:34] I didn't prepare.
[24:46] All things
[24:49] he do.
[24:53] I grew my hair.
[24:59] He that hath an ear to hear.
[25:03] The evening time
[25:07] is near.
[25:10] Amen.
[25:11] &gt;&gt; Thank you so much. Thank the Lord. We're
[25:14] at the evening time and not only at the
[25:16] evening time, we are at the end of the
[25:19] evening time. All things are just about
[25:23] run out. It's good to be here. Thank you
[25:24] musicians. Let's we'll just get right
[25:26] into the word and it's good to see all
[25:29] of you out on this cold cold Wednesday
[25:31] night.
[25:33] Might as well enjoy the service tonight
[25:34] cuz we probably won't have one Sunday.
[25:36] Not being negative, but you know the
[25:38] weather forecasters, they said it's
[25:40] going to dump it. So that's yet to be
[25:43] seen. But we're glad that we're here.
[25:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[25:46] &gt;&gt; Glad that we are under the umbrella of a
[25:48] word message.
[25:49] &gt;&gt; Oh, praise the Lord. I guess I probably
[25:53] got brother Sean's uh blood pressure up
[25:55] just a little bit because I didn't get
[25:57] here to about 10 tail and I said you
[26:00] probably was down there praying
[26:03] &gt;&gt; cuz I hadn't.
[26:05] &gt;&gt; But we're here and
[26:06] &gt;&gt; I've got a a real blessful message for
[26:09] you tonight.
[26:10] &gt;&gt; I think it'd be wonderful. Let's turn to
[26:12] the book of Romans 8 and 15. Just going
[26:14] to read two scriptures. Romans 8:15 and
[26:17] 1 John 4.
[26:20] And we're going to look a lot into 1
[26:21] John chapter 4. Several verses there.
[26:24] And we'll read verse
[26:27] 15 of Romans chapter 8.
[26:32] The scriptures are not new, but some of
[26:34] the things that I want to bring to you
[26:37] are not new, but hopefully that we can
[26:39] time together in a way that would be uh
[26:42] beneficial for the hour that we're
[26:45] living in.
[26:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:48] &gt;&gt; Romans 8:15 says, "For ye have not
[26:51] received the spirit of bondage again to
[26:54] fear, that's like dread and terror. But
[26:58] you have received the spirit of adoption
[27:01] whereby we cry abba father. You say well
[27:04] a spirit of adoption what is what is
[27:06] adoption? Adoption really is being
[27:08] anointed with this god's spirit the
[27:10] token spirit to actually to come to
[27:12] maturity. That's adoption. Amen.
[27:14] &gt;&gt; And then if we read in 1 John 4:18,
[27:18] it says,
[27:20] "There is no fear in love, but perfect
[27:24] love casteth out fear, because fear hath
[27:29] what?
[27:30] &gt;&gt; Torment."
[27:31] &gt;&gt; Torment.
[27:32] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[27:33] &gt;&gt; He that fearth is not made perfect in
[27:37] love.
[27:38] &gt;&gt; And we're going to look a lot in St.
[27:40] John or 1 John 4. But let's just bow our
[27:43] heads and pray. Lord, we've read these
[27:45] two scriptures. And we already know uh
[27:48] perhaps what direction that we're going
[27:50] to go to when we talk about fear. Uh not
[27:54] given the spirit of of uh of of uh
[27:58] bondage, but Lord, we get that spirit of
[28:00] adoption. We're thankful, Lord, for the
[28:02] open book of this hour. So thankful that
[28:04] you sent us a messenger. Thank you,
[28:06] Lord, that Revelations 10:1 has been
[28:08] fulfilled. Revelation 10:7, uh, Malachi
[28:12] for all these wonderful scriptures that
[28:13] you've given that are pertinent to our
[28:15] day. We're so thankful for each one,
[28:18] Lord. Now, take this vessel, Lord, that
[28:20] hide me behind the cross. Lord, I've
[28:22] studied. I've prepared. I've prayed.
[28:25] Lord, I'm not a inspirational preacher.
[28:27] I'm a teacher. But Lord, let these words
[28:29] sink deep into our heart that we might
[28:32] better understand. As the prophet said
[28:33] in the first seal, I'm going to call you
[28:36] bride so that you may understand. and we
[28:38] want to understand and understanding
[28:41] actually is one form of revelation. So
[28:43] we ask that you would help us tonight
[28:45] God you get the glory. We ask for your
[28:49] help hide me behind the cross as I said
[28:51] Lord let me get out of the way and may
[28:52] you have preeminence in the service. We
[28:54] ask in Jesus name and everybody says
[28:57] amen you can be seated. I want to talk a
[29:00] little bit tonight
[29:01] if I were to give it a title on
[29:03] revelation
[29:05] removes fear or revelation takes away
[29:07] fear. Now give you just a a couple of
[29:11] little thoughts as we go on. Well, we
[29:14] cry abba father as we read in Romans
[29:15] 8:15.
[29:17] Uh receive the spirit of adoption
[29:19] whereby we cry abba father. Abba father.
[29:22] It's like daddy daddy father. You say
[29:25] why? Well, we actually have a new
[29:27] standing when we're born again. We have
[29:29] a new standing with God. He's our
[29:31] father. We have a father just like a
[29:34] natural father. But you just multiply
[29:35] that many, many more times. What the a
[29:38] true father that really has a really
[29:41] yearning and desire and an overseer for
[29:44] his children. We have a father and we
[29:46] are now sons of God. We're not slaves.
[29:50] We have to get away from that slave
[29:52] mentality. We're we're not servants.
[29:54] We're not slaves. The Jews are servants,
[29:56] but we are sons.
[29:58] &gt;&gt; And our estate has changed from
[30:00] condemned sinners to actual privileged
[30:03] sons of God.
[30:04] &gt;&gt; We're trying to, as brother said, we got
[30:06] to recognize who we are. Not that we are
[30:08] worthy of that, but we've got to, he's
[30:10] given it to us. We must accept it. And
[30:12] now, we have a legal right and a special
[30:14] privileges of divine sunship. Just a few
[30:17] little things as we run through here.
[30:18] And we are we are are invited into this
[30:22] relationship solely on Christ's merit.
[30:24] None of our own. Nothing we had to do
[30:26] with it solely because he chose his
[30:29] bride before the foundation of the
[30:30] world. Might as well, you know, just I
[30:33] mean I'm a firm believer is what what
[30:35] the Bible says. Ephesians chapter 1 2 3
[30:38] 4. We are predestinated. We're chosen in
[30:40] Christ. I had nothing to do with it.
[30:43] When God chose Paul, I mean, he's a
[30:46] chosen vessel for this and for this, for
[30:48] this. I mean, he had nothing to do. God
[30:49] chose him. That's just the way it is.
[30:51] God's sovereign. He does what he wants
[30:52] to. One vessel of honor, another. It
[30:55] makes a dishonor. Now, we we we we now
[30:59] meet God as father and not as judge.
[31:02] We're so thankful for that. In 1 John
[31:04] 4:16, it says this, "And we know and
[31:08] believe the love of God." And we know
[31:10] and believe the love that God hath to
[31:13] us. Now, this is only possible if you're
[31:16] born again, truly born again. And we
[31:18] know and believe the love that God had
[31:20] toward us. God is love, and he that
[31:22] dwelleth in love dwelleth in God and God
[31:25] in him. Now, this verse here, we're
[31:28] actually talking about salvation. And I
[31:30] want you to notice as we go through some
[31:31] of these verses here, as brother M said,
[31:33] in that day, you'll know that I am the
[31:35] father, the father in me, I and you, you
[31:37] and me. How many times even in St. John
[31:39] or 1 John 4 that we get this same
[31:42] thought as we head right we just read it
[31:44] in verse 16 it God is love and he that
[31:48] dwelleth in love dwelleth in God and God
[31:51] in him
[31:52] &gt;&gt; I in you you and me
[31:54] &gt;&gt; there again salvation amen how many time
[31:58] now notice as we go through verse 17
[32:00] herein okay herein is our love made
[32:04] perfect God's love is already perfect is
[32:06] our made love made perfect that we may
[32:10] have boldness in the day of judgment
[32:12] because as he is so are we in this
[32:15] world. We'll get to that just in a
[32:17] minute. Boldness in this scripture
[32:18] actually means confidence.
[32:20] &gt;&gt; We don't want to be like bold, you know,
[32:22] like the world is bold or brassy. But
[32:25] this boldness is actually confidence.
[32:27] &gt;&gt; Here is our love be perfect that we may
[32:29] have confidence in the day of judgment.
[32:31] Now we'll get to that in a minute. The
[32:33] day of judgment. What is our judgment?
[32:35] There's no fear in love, but perfect
[32:37] love casteth out fear because fear hath
[32:42] torment. That's either restraint or
[32:45] punishment. Restraint actually means
[32:47] only being able to mature so far. But
[32:50] that's not perfect love.
[32:53] &gt;&gt; Perfect love casteth out fear because
[32:55] fear have torment. And he that fearth is
[32:58] not made perfect in love.
[33:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now we must understand fear has
[33:06] torment.
[33:07] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[33:07] &gt;&gt; Fear has torment. God does not desire
[33:10] his children to fear.
[33:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:12] &gt;&gt; Now last Sunday, brother Shawn preached
[33:15] on protection. And there's natural and
[33:17] and spiritual protections. And there's
[33:19] all kinds of protections that he talked
[33:21] about and we're thankful for all of
[33:23] God's protections. So tonight I want to
[33:26] talk about another type of protection if
[33:29] you will and that's revelation. That's a
[33:31] real protection if you want to look at
[33:33] it that way. Now, we know that sons of
[33:36] God are led by the spirit of God. But
[33:38] Satan is a mimic. He's an imitator and
[33:40] he is a deceiver. There's so many
[33:43] spirits out there, so many voices in the
[33:45] world. We understand that. So many
[33:47] voices and they're all trying to lead
[33:49] you. They're all trying to lead you. So,
[33:52] who are we going to be led by? All kinds
[33:55] of voices.
[33:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:56] &gt;&gt; But all remember he's a he's a deceiver.
[33:59] He's a mimicker. He's a impersonator.
[34:01] But there is a true revelation. There is
[34:03] a true spirit of God and there is a true
[34:06] leadership of God.
[34:08] &gt;&gt; We want to try to better understand as
[34:11] as as 1 John 4:18 says, "Perfect love
[34:14] cast out fear." We want to try to better
[34:16] understand and actually blend
[34:19] that that uh there's no as as I said
[34:24] there, perfect love casteth out fear.
[34:27] Yeah. and revelation removes all fear
[34:30] fear. I want to try to blend these two
[34:31] thoughts together.
[34:33] &gt;&gt; Now, I don't know this quote I'm going
[34:35] to read. I think brother Shawn read it
[34:37] last weekend or something, but he said,
[34:38] "Now, you cannot do anything unless you
[34:41] know what you're doing."
[34:42] &gt;&gt; You must know that it is the will of
[34:45] God. You must know that it his plan and
[34:47] his desire and it's revealed to you.
[34:50] Revealed to you. Revealed to you.
[34:53] &gt;&gt; Revelation revealed to you. We're rarely
[34:56] going to emphasize revelation because
[34:58] revelation is our subject. Revelation
[35:00] removes fear.
[35:02] &gt;&gt; You must know that it is his plan, his
[35:04] desire, and it's revealed to you and
[35:06] there's nothing going to stop it.
[35:08] Another time, brother man says, you got
[35:10] to first know what you're doing before
[35:13] you can have faith to do it.
[35:16] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[35:17] &gt;&gt; You got to know what you're doing.
[35:22] &gt;&gt; Remember always, faith is a revelation.
[35:24] understood faith is a revelation.
[35:28] Now with this open book, faith has been
[35:30] restored by the seventh angel messenger.
[35:32] Also, brother Bam said the Holy Ghost
[35:34] was bound for 2,000 years, but was to be
[35:36] loosed by the seventh angel messenger.
[35:38] This day, this scripture is fulfilled.
[35:40] We know that. Now, I want to set the
[35:42] stage just a little bit uh for the last
[35:45] days of Leodysia. That's where we are
[35:47] today. This is Satan's Eden. This is
[35:49] Satan's paradise. This is Satan's
[35:51] kingdom. This is Satan's zed. You have
[35:53] to understand this is the last days of
[35:55] Leosa. This is his this is his great
[35:58] paradise and we're living right in the
[36:00] middle of it or at the end of it. Take
[36:02] it back. The end of it. Everything in
[36:04] the world order today is evil. It's
[36:07] perverted. It's anti-word. It's
[36:09] polluted. It's deceiving. It's corrupt.
[36:12] It's Sodom. It's Gomorrah. Fear
[36:14] everywhere. Everything is fear. Doom,
[36:16] glued, apocalypse, you name it. It's all
[36:19] fear.
[36:20] &gt;&gt; The lid's been taken off of hell. 200
[36:22] million demons been released since uh uh
[36:26] Hitler and Stalin in the 40s in World
[36:28] War II. And brother Bram even said his
[36:30] souls is now in prison. He said there I
[36:33] was in JC Penney store again. He said
[36:36] there I was in JC Penney back in hell
[36:39] again.
[36:41] &gt;&gt; Back in hell again. What was he trying
[36:43] to say? Hell is upon this earth. The lid
[36:45] of hell has actually been taken off. So
[36:48] all those demons now are focused on who?
[36:51] the closest thing to God which is his
[36:53] bride.
[36:54] &gt;&gt; But our kingdom that's Leoa that's the
[36:58] stage for the last days of Leosa. But
[37:01] our kingdom teaches different. Our king
[37:03] declares that revelation takes away fear
[37:06] and perfect love casts out fear. Now the
[37:09] natural always types of spirits. We know
[37:11] that. Let's brief briefly just look at a
[37:14] couple of different well there's all
[37:16] kinds of different types of of of u
[37:20] fears but just just a couple because I
[37:22] want to just cover maybe one or two or
[37:24] three or four just different types of
[37:26] fear. Now we know we got a winter storm
[37:28] coming. Okay, we all heard that. Now how
[37:29] do we know that? Social media uh radio
[37:32] on your phone, iPad, whatever like that.
[37:35] Because of modern radar they've been
[37:37] able to warn us that there's going to be
[37:39] a storm coming. How much we're going to
[37:40] get? We don't have a clue, but there's
[37:42] going to be some precipitation of some
[37:44] point. So, because of that, that
[37:47] actually when you believe, if they're
[37:49] accurate, if you believe what they're
[37:50] saying, that's a form of revelation.
[37:52] Now, that revelation is going to give
[37:54] you an understanding where you actually
[37:55] can prepare and be less caught off guard
[37:58] when that time comes. So, there is a
[38:01] benefit. There is one type of of fear
[38:03] that you don't have to worry as much as
[38:06] you if it just come 100 years ago. You
[38:08] don't have a clue. You know, you wake up
[38:09] the next morning, you got a foot of
[38:10] snow. You didn't know it was coming.
[38:12] &gt;&gt; So, we're thankful for that. Here's
[38:14] another time. Here's a simple little
[38:16] thing. What if you didn't have a gas
[38:17] gauge in your car?
[38:19] &gt;&gt; Okay, you're driving, you're going down
[38:21] Texas Highway and you know, and they
[38:23] just for miles and miles and miles and m
[38:25] you don't have a gas. Well, let's see
[38:26] now. I'm supposed to get out. Let's see.
[38:28] Now, wait. I've done 100 miles. If you
[38:30] didn't have a gas gauge in your car,
[38:31] guess what? You're going to be worried
[38:33] every 20 minutes. I'm going to run out
[38:35] of gas. I'm going to run out of gas. the
[38:37] one place you don't want to run on gas
[38:38] in Texas on a highway, you know, when
[38:40] there's no place to stop. Well, plenty
[38:42] place to stop. No gas stations.
[38:44] &gt;&gt; So, you know, you have a gas gauge in
[38:46] there. And now, even modern cars have a
[38:48] little light blinking and you know, when
[38:50] you get down, you got a gallon left. So,
[38:52] you know, it's a warning light. That's a
[38:53] warning light. That's that is to help
[38:55] you.
[38:56] &gt;&gt; That takes away fear. That's a simple
[38:58] illustration, but that takes away fear.
[39:00] When you get down to the end, it's time
[39:02] to get gas. I don't have to worry about
[39:03] it. Now, there's there's principles
[39:06] behind these little illustrations.
[39:08] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[39:08] &gt;&gt; Now, remember, as I just said, you've
[39:10] got to first know what you're doing
[39:12] before you can have faith to do it. And
[39:14] faith is a revelation.
[39:17] &gt;&gt; Now, uh, a couple other things I want to
[39:20] tell, and I'm going to try to abbreviate
[39:22] them. I remember several years ago, I
[39:25] think it was a 95, 94, 95, we took a
[39:28] hunting trip to Colorado. It was it was
[39:30] brother Mark Namos and and Sam and
[39:32] Johnny and his sons and um and myself
[39:35] and we kind of hunt and and and have a
[39:39] buddy system. So I was with brother
[39:41] Mark. We didn't hunt together, but we
[39:42] know where each of us is going to hunt.
[39:44] And I'm going to just try to condense
[39:46] this. So I was out on this canyon and
[39:48] had the four-wheeler and been hunting
[39:49] all day. So when it got down to the end,
[39:52] uh it's about 5:00 or something. It's
[39:54] time to go back to camp. So for and I
[39:57] know the reason when we get that but my
[39:59] four-wheeler wouldn't start. I did
[40:01] everything I could. So I'm 13 miles from
[40:04] the camp. It's already we had a not a
[40:06] blizzard but a storm coming. It's
[40:08] already starting to snow. A lot of my
[40:10] trick trek back was uphill. I had to
[40:12] carry my rifle and my pistol and I'm
[40:15] I've got to start walking back towards I
[40:17] can't stay there all night. I'll freeze
[40:18] to death out there. So I got one hope of
[40:20] getting out of there. Now Mark knew
[40:22] about where I was at but he didn't know.
[40:25] I mean, I should have been back, you
[40:26] know, at 5:30, 6:30, whatever. So, I
[40:29] started walking and I walked and I
[40:31] walked and I walked. Now, I want you to
[40:33] understand where I was at down that
[40:36] canyon. It was a a logging road and a
[40:39] four and a regular pickup could go down
[40:40] that logging road. Then it got within
[40:42] about four miles of where I was at that
[40:44] canyon. It reduced down to a little
[40:46] four-wheeler trail. A vehicle couldn't
[40:48] go down there, but just a four-wheeler.
[40:51] But this little trail went way out about
[40:54] a mile or two and then curved back in
[40:56] and then went back up there towards the
[40:59] the the road coming in. And it's dark.
[41:02] It's snowing and I've got to walk this
[41:05] thing back.
[41:06] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[41:06] &gt;&gt; Okay. I knew one thing now. I could have
[41:09] taken the shortcut and actually gone
[41:11] from that point where I was at and gone
[41:13] through the wilderness, through the
[41:14] woods to maybe cut off a mile or mile
[41:16] and a half. But then I'm just out in the
[41:18] woods. don't know, have a clue where I'm
[41:20] at and so forth like that. But I knew
[41:22] one thing. I had this one revelation. If
[41:24] I stay on that, I knew how I got in
[41:26] there. I had I come in on a logging
[41:28] trail. A logging little trail. I knew if
[41:31] I stayed on that logging trail, I'm
[41:33] eventually I'm going to get out of here.
[41:35] &gt;&gt; Don't deviate.
[41:37] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[41:37] &gt;&gt; Now, that's another Now, you say, "Well,
[41:39] Brother Terry, was you was you scared?"
[41:41] Not very much. cuz I knew if I stayed on
[41:44] that trail, if I didn't get hypothermia
[41:47] and just die from my body temperature,
[41:49] you know, getting down so low, I was
[41:51] going to make it out there even if I had
[41:52] to walk the 13 miles. So, actually, I
[41:55] walked about four miles and it was about
[41:57] three or four hours. And I'm just, you
[41:59] know, and there was another guy in a
[42:01] tent over there, but he the snow he done
[42:03] packed up and left. So, I thought I'm
[42:05] probably going to have to walk back to
[42:07] camp, but I was determined to do it. I
[42:09] was well on my way probably 4 miles and
[42:12] I saw a faint light way in the distance
[42:14] out there and got closer and closer and
[42:17] closer and it was a headlight of a
[42:19] pickup truck and finally came up there.
[42:21] Mark said, "Hey buddy, you want to
[42:22] ride?"
[42:24] I believe I could have kissed him. I
[42:27] believe I could have hugged him right
[42:28] there
[42:30] because I didn't I don't care. I don't
[42:32] care who it was. That light meant
[42:34] humanity and somebody is going to help
[42:36] me. But I knew my point is my revelation
[42:39] was if I stay on that trail,
[42:41] &gt;&gt; I'm going to make it back to safety. If
[42:43] you stay on God's trail, this word,
[42:45] you're going to make it to safety. But
[42:47] you got to have a revel. What is the
[42:49] trail? What is the path? I am the way.
[42:52] There's only one way. You got to stay
[42:54] with that.
[42:55] &gt;&gt; Now, here's a here's another type of of
[42:58] uh fear that I want to talk about. And
[43:00] this is a experience I had in the Air
[43:02] Force. And I was afraid. I love to fly
[43:07] and I was a crew chief on C130 and the
[43:10] the crew chief flew with the airplane
[43:11] especially overseas. We took care of all
[43:13] the maintenance and we flew all over
[43:15] Europe on a 4 engine big 4 engine cargo
[43:17] C130. Okay. We was flying from England
[43:20] down to uh Suda Bayrete aisle in Lrete.
[43:23] And when we got about even with Athens,
[43:26] Greece, loadmaster came up told us that
[43:28] look we are the the elevator boost pack
[43:30] is spurting out hydraulic fluid. The
[43:32] primary and the secondary we're just
[43:34] losing hydraulic fluid. It's the same
[43:36] thing as your power steering goes out on
[43:38] your car. When your power steering goes
[43:39] out, you can a little bit steer that.
[43:41] But on an airplane when it's power
[43:43] steering goes out, it's all cables. You
[43:45] cannot move them surfaces. It's almost
[43:47] impossible. So it was it was dee uh
[43:51] depleting the system very very fast. So
[43:53] we called Athens at Mayday Mayday. They
[43:56] they cleared us to land. We was about 10
[43:59] 15 minutes from Athens. So we made
[44:00] emergency land there. Okay. 3 days later
[44:03] I got a new elevator boost pack. I put
[44:04] the elevator boost pack in me and the
[44:06] other crew chief. So we we took it out,
[44:09] ran the engines and did through all the
[44:11] flight control services. Everything
[44:12] looked good. Now, of all the flying that
[44:16] I did when I was overseas, I got scared
[44:19] twice, and this was one of them. I was
[44:21] scared to death. Here's what happened.
[44:25] Okay, we get down. We only had uh a
[44:28] little bit of cargo, 3/4 fuel, you just
[44:31] make a small trip to Spain or wherever.
[44:34] So, the normal takeoff is run your
[44:37] engine up, take off, rotation about 150
[44:39] knots, whatever. pull the yolk back,
[44:41] have an angle of attack you climb out on
[44:44] and, you know, go up so much, bring your
[44:46] flaps in, etc., etc. We know the nor
[44:48] takeoff. Now, as a crew chief, I'm up in
[44:50] the flight deck with a pilot, co-pilot,
[44:52] flight engineer, navigator, and I'm I'm
[44:55] up there in the flight deck, and I'm on
[44:57] headset, and I know all the instructions
[44:59] for landing, takeoff all the time. But
[45:01] this time, for what I was busy doing
[45:03] something else, I did not get the
[45:06] takeoff instructions.
[45:08] very very critical to this situation in
[45:11] my illustration. This true story. So
[45:14] here we are. We're taking off. Normally
[45:16] like I said, you go have a certain angle
[45:18] attack. You go up. Everything's fine. So
[45:20] we go down the road, go down the runway
[45:22] rather. He pulls it back just a little
[45:25] bit. We just barely get off the ground.
[45:27] Now remember the elevator boost pack. I
[45:29] changed I helped change it. Me and the
[45:30] other crew chief. So if it don't work,
[45:32] guess whose fault it is?
[45:34] &gt;&gt; So this is in my mind, you know. So He
[45:38] gets up just above the trees. He
[45:41] retracts the landing gear, which is
[45:42] unusual because it usually gets higher
[45:44] than that. Retracts the landing gear.
[45:46] And I'm thinking, "This ain't good. This
[45:49] ain't good. We're just barely clearing
[45:50] the trees." And getting up more speed,
[45:52] more speed, more speed, and we're just
[45:54] barely clearing the trees. But he's
[45:56] getting up more air speed, more air
[45:57] speed. About that time, I didn't see the
[46:01] the yolk, but the airplane just went
[46:04] like that from to almost straight up.
[46:06] Then it almost straight up then he falls
[46:08] over to the side. I said that's it.
[46:10] We're finished. It's over. I mean, we're
[46:12] dead. Gone. I was scared to death. Why?
[46:15] Cuz I had put it in there. I had done a
[46:18] maintenance on it. Something was wrong
[46:20] cuz what he did was not normal. We've
[46:22] never done that before.
[46:24] Now, the problem is I was not on the
[46:28] headset. I did not get the the take off
[46:31] instructions. These symptoms that I just
[46:33] described to you
[46:36] were false symptoms because once he had
[46:40] pulled out and fell over like that and
[46:42] and and evened out, I heard the tower. I
[46:44] was on the headset there and the tower
[46:46] said, "Nice takeoff, guys. Enjoyed that
[46:49] Shaunell takeoff." That was kind of a
[46:52] little um exhibition takeoff they did
[46:54] for the tower.
[46:56] &gt;&gt; Now listen, okay? Had I been on the
[46:59] headset and had I known the takeoff
[47:01] instructions, I would have enjoyed every
[47:04] second of that takeoff.
[47:07] But because they were fault symptoms, if
[47:09] you will, I thought that the plane was
[47:12] not function correctly because something
[47:15] wrong with the boost pack. Because of
[47:17] that, I had fear. I was literally Sean
[47:20] afraid. It's over. It's finished.
[47:23] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[47:25] But had I had that revelation,
[47:27] &gt;&gt; right?
[47:28] &gt;&gt; Revelation takes away fear.
[47:30] &gt;&gt; True.
[47:32] &gt;&gt; Now that's in the natural. Let's we can
[47:34] type that in the spiritual. You can you
[47:37] can you can you can talk about and we no
[47:40] need to go through all the examples, but
[47:41] there's dozens in the Bible. Elijah when
[47:44] there was some dispute between uh you
[47:46] know Ahab and God and and Elijah was
[47:49] going to call fire down from heaven and
[47:51] Elijah says you know before he called
[47:53] down that fire he says all these things
[47:55] I have done at thy command
[47:57] &gt;&gt; command
[47:58] &gt;&gt; at thy command. Now what is what is he
[48:00] saying
[48:04] &gt;&gt; Elijah had seen a vision or God had
[48:07] spoke to him what was fixed to take
[48:09] place. Elijah was not afraid. None. Zero
[48:12] zilch. Because he knows what was going
[48:14] to happen. He had no fear, you know, and
[48:17] he even mocks them, you know, put water
[48:19] on it, bring more barrels in, not get
[48:20] what like that. He knows what was going
[48:22] to happen. So, he had no fear of what
[48:25] was going to take place.
[48:26] &gt;&gt; True, right?
[48:27] &gt;&gt; All these things I've done at thy
[48:29] command.
[48:31] &gt;&gt; Revelation takes away fear.
[48:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:36] Now, and we could talk about here's
[48:38] another another type of fear. Now, this
[48:41] of course, brother was a prophet of God.
[48:42] He saw visions. And we've spoke about it
[48:44] many times, but I just read the last
[48:46] part of it. Talking about the maniac in
[48:48] Portland. And in the book, probably some
[48:50] of you read that night when the maniac
[48:52] run to the platform there at Oregon was
[48:54] going to take my life. Somebody said,
[48:57] "Brother Brandom, was you scared?"
[49:01] &gt;&gt; Now, you have to put yourself in your
[49:03] place there. This guy, he says about 7
[49:05] foot tall. I mean, he was out of his
[49:07] mind. He said, "I'll break every bone in
[49:09] your body." And he well could do it,
[49:11] &gt;&gt; right?
[49:13] &gt;&gt; He said, "Brother Random, was you
[49:14] scared?" I said, "No, sir. Not a bit."
[49:17] Now, we either believe that or we don't.
[49:20] &gt;&gt; I believe it.
[49:22] &gt;&gt; He said, "As long as Jesus is there and
[49:24] as long as he told me to do this and I'm
[49:28] in his will, there's nothing to fear."
[49:31] See, as long as you're doing what he
[49:34] says do and you know you're directly
[49:38] led, I mean, there's there's some
[49:39] criteria in here now. You're directly
[49:41] led. Well, there's nothing to fear.
[49:44] Perfect. And then he, brother Bam,
[49:46] actually refers back to that scripture
[49:48] that we're reading. Verse 18, perfect
[49:51] love casts out all fear.
[49:54] &gt;&gt; There is no fear in God. Love takes away
[49:58] fear.
[50:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[50:01] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[50:02] &gt;&gt; Now, before we go any further, we got
[50:05] this idea about perfect love and what is
[50:09] perfect love and all about perfect love.
[50:14] Brother Bam said, the angel said, "Had
[50:17] this is what you preached was the Holy
[50:19] Ghost. This is perfect love." I don't
[50:20] want to get ahead of myself, but I want
[50:22] to bring this in right now. We only take
[50:25] with us what? Our character.
[50:27] &gt;&gt; Yeah. So, if we're going to have to have
[50:29] perfect love over there, cuz the only
[50:31] thing that'll enter here is perfect
[50:33] love. You know what that means? I'm not
[50:35] real smart, but I know that that means
[50:37] you got to have it here if you're going
[50:39] to take it with you to get in there. So,
[50:41] if we got to have it here before we
[50:43] leave, I want to ask you, when do we get
[50:46] it?
[50:47] &gt;&gt; When do we get perfect love?
[50:50] &gt;&gt; Oh, but perfect love, that's such a
[50:52] great big high thing. It is. It is. But
[50:55] we got to have it on this side. Amen.
[50:58] Right.
[50:58] &gt;&gt; Because it that's the only thing that'll
[51:00] enter.
[51:02] &gt;&gt; Now, I want to I I thought about this,
[51:06] you know, being in the the seed time and
[51:10] harvest time. And I thought about this
[51:11] right before I left. I uh printed out
[51:14] the quote. If I would ask you a
[51:16] question, we know we're supposed to have
[51:18] it before we leave. We know we're
[51:19] supposed to have it to get in there. Was
[51:21] there any another any other age ever had
[51:24] perfect love?
[51:26] Interesting. Yes, there was one age
[51:29] Ephesians age. You know, there was it
[51:31] really started about I think brother V
[51:32] said AD55 was the start of the Ephesians
[51:34] church age. Christ was ended at 33. So
[51:37] it's about 22 23 years between that time
[51:40] when the church was
[51:42] in its perfection if you will. Dan
[51:45] actually started the first church age
[51:46] and brother Bram actually talks about
[51:48] and I'll read the whole thing but the
[51:49] rebuke to the feast of Ephesus church
[51:52] age and he goes down and talks about
[51:53] different things like that but to save
[51:55] time and he says down at the end he said
[51:57] God rebuked their living leaving their
[52:00] first love for backsliding and for no
[52:04] longer bearing light. Ephesus was not a
[52:07] deceived church. It failed. Now listen,
[52:10] it failed. Why it failed? He said it
[52:13] failed. itself by not continuing in
[52:17] perfect love.
[52:20] &gt;&gt; Those first 20 years they had perfect
[52:22] love.
[52:23] &gt;&gt; This is harvest time. Somebody's going
[52:25] to have perfect love.
[52:27] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[52:28] &gt;&gt; Okay. Now,
[52:32] uh, and we read that about, listen, he
[52:35] says,
[52:36] uh, as long as you're doing what he
[52:38] says, then he said, I already read that
[52:41] part, but as long as you're doing what
[52:42] he says, do and you know that you're
[52:44] directly led. Well, then there's nothing
[52:46] to fear. Perfect love cast out fear.
[52:47] There's no fear in God. Love takes away
[52:50] all fear. Now, in 1 John 4:18, perfect
[52:54] love cast out fear. Now, this scripture
[52:57] usually, and I'm want to try to not
[52:59] preach a lot right now, but I want try
[53:01] to go through these things here so we
[53:02] can don't want to hold too long. Uh,
[53:05] this scripture really deals usually
[53:07] deals with people having love one for
[53:09] another. And that's true. And brother
[53:10] Ma'am also quoted, "Perfect love cast
[53:13] out fear." And that's true. And he
[53:14] quoted when he's talking about the
[53:15] killer bull, perfect love cast out fear.
[53:18] And that's all true, too. And with the
[53:20] hornets, and that's also true. And we
[53:22] know that. And also, brother Beam used
[53:24] this phrase dealing uh like if you're
[53:26] afraid that you wrong somebody or hurt
[53:28] somebody, that's true also. But if you
[53:31] notice these scriptures in and in and uh
[53:34] u first John 4 having to do with
[53:37] salvation and that's what we want to
[53:39] really focus on. It actually has to do
[53:42] with f salvation. That's what we want to
[53:44] look at. Fear. fear in verse verse uh 18
[53:49] actually comes from the this is really
[53:51] interesting comes from the Greek word
[53:53] and that word is phobus
[53:56] which means dread or terror and that's
[53:59] where we get our word phobia
[54:02] &gt;&gt; phobia
[54:04] you got which is phobia is irrational
[54:07] excessive or a persistent fear of
[54:10] something or situation you got
[54:12] claustrophobia
[54:13] uh that's enclosure small enclosure
[54:16] A acrophobia that's afraid of heights.
[54:19] Hydrophobia that's water and and John I
[54:22] think he's writing about Christophobia
[54:24] if you want to talk about that people
[54:26] having fear about salvation.
[54:30] Now fear almost every time a human came
[54:33] into the presence of the angel of the
[54:35] Lord or any angel what's the first words
[54:37] always come out of the angel's mouth
[54:39] first two words that comes out of all
[54:41] situations fear not.
[54:44] First thing they say, fear not. Go back
[54:46] and read all of them. Zachcharias, Mary,
[54:48] Joseph, Paul in the ship 14 days.
[54:50] Brother Ram 1946 when he got his
[54:52] commission. Fear not. I'm in come from
[54:55] the presence of almighty God. And on and
[54:56] on and on. Why? Because it's it's an
[54:59] awesome thing to be even in an angel's
[55:01] presence. What about when you're in
[55:03] God's presence?
[55:05] &gt;&gt; My such a awesome thing. So God doesn't
[55:08] want us to fear. That's the trick of
[55:10] Satan. God doesn't want us to to fear at
[55:12] all. So verse 18 again, there is no fear
[55:17] in love, but perfect love cast out fear
[55:20] because fear have torment. He that
[55:22] fearth is not made perfect in love. Now
[55:25] this scripture is written to believers.
[55:26] So I want to ask you a question. Can a
[55:29] believer
[55:31] have fear and torment at the same time?
[55:33] And I'm going to answer that. Well, yes
[55:35] and no. It depends.
[55:37] If a Christian can actually live in fear
[55:40] and torment concerning their destiny if
[55:44] they don't really have a new birth or
[55:47] they don't really have a revelation of
[55:49] their conversion or they don't
[55:50] understand this scripture but once they
[55:53] are truly born again truly have a
[55:55] revelation of of this scripture and the
[55:58] love of God in their heart and what
[56:00] God's love for them is and justification
[56:03] and all these ramifications there is no
[56:06] fear Perfect love cast out fear.
[56:09] &gt;&gt; God's love is perfect. And God's love
[56:12] toward us is perfect.
[56:15] &gt;&gt; So this uh mystic idea of what is
[56:17] perfect love? Yeah, it's somewhat
[56:19] mystic, but it's it's really a
[56:21] simplicity of we'll get to it in a
[56:23] minute.
[56:26] Brother says, "No man knows the things
[56:28] of God." Or the scripture says, "No man
[56:30] knows the things of God, say the spirit
[56:31] of God, and he to whom the spirit of God
[56:34] reveals them." Brother B says we need to
[56:36] call on God for revelation more than
[56:38] anything else in the world. We have
[56:40] accepted the Bible. We have accepted the
[56:42] great truths of it. But still it's not
[56:45] real to most people because the
[56:47] revelation by the spirit is not there.
[56:51] &gt;&gt; The word has not been quickened. Every
[56:53] word is seed and every every seed has
[56:55] got to be quickened at some point.
[56:58] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[56:59] &gt;&gt; As we well know uh Jesus asked
[57:01] disciples, who do you say I the son of
[57:03] man am? And Peter said, "The art of
[57:04] Christ, flesh and blood has not revealed
[57:06] the issue, but my father which is
[57:07] heaven, upon this rock, I'll build my
[57:09] church." We understand that it's the
[57:11] whole church is built on the spiritual
[57:12] revelation of who Jesus Christ is.
[57:14] Spiritual revelation all about
[57:17] revelation. Spiritual revelation.
[57:19] &gt;&gt; The whole church is built, it's the most
[57:21] fundamental doctrine. It's built on the
[57:23] spiritual revelation of who Christ is.
[57:25] Another time, brother says, "The
[57:27] importance of revelation by the spirit
[57:28] to a true believer can never be
[57:30] overemphasized.
[57:31] Revelation means more to you than
[57:33] perhaps you realize. And I'm not talking
[57:35] about this book of Revelation. I'm
[57:37] talking about all Revelation. It's
[57:39] tremendously tremendously important to
[57:42] the church. Not only tremendously
[57:44] important, it's actually paramount. It's
[57:46] critical. It's actually so critical. Uh
[57:50] it's it's s so high on the scale.
[57:52] There's nothing really surpassed because
[57:55] well, of course, we know that the only
[57:57] thing that might be higher if you want
[57:58] to look at it that way. Brother man
[57:59] said, "Lay aside everything until you
[58:02] get perfect love because perfect love is
[58:04] the only thing that's going to enter
[58:05] there."
[58:06] &gt;&gt; That's true.
[58:06] &gt;&gt; So then we want to blend what is perfect
[58:08] love and how does perfect love cast out
[58:10] fear?
[58:12] &gt;&gt; Let's look at that.
[58:15] And
[58:17] before we leave tonight, I want you to
[58:19] really better understand about
[58:22] revelation of perfect love. Okay? I want
[58:25] you to let's dig a little deeper.
[58:27] &gt;&gt; Let's look at love. Let's look at
[58:29] perfect love. Uh we're going to go
[58:31] through some the scriptures of St. John
[58:33] or 1 John 4 and let's start with verse
[58:36] 10.
[58:38] First John 4:10. Here in herein is love.
[58:41] Really herein is love. Okay. He said
[58:44] herein is love statement. Don't miss
[58:48] this. Not that we love God but that he
[58:51] loved us and sent his son to be a propit
[58:54] forit perpetuation for us. There again,
[58:58] salvation. Salvation. Salvation. Verse
[59:01] 11. Beloved, if God so loved us, we
[59:04] ought to love one another. Again, God's
[59:07] love for us was salvation. Our love for
[59:09] others that they would also possess
[59:11] salvation. Still has to do with
[59:12] salvation. Our love for others that they
[59:14] truly also will be saved. Verse 12,
[59:18] no man has seen God at any time. If we
[59:22] love one another, God dwelleth in us and
[59:25] his love is perfected in us. In us, in
[59:28] us. And what is his love? What is his
[59:31] love? His love is his life.
[59:33] &gt;&gt; We want his. We need his life in us. And
[59:35] what what is the token life? What is the
[59:37] token? The literal life of Christ in the
[59:39] believer. Verse 13.
[59:42] Hereby we know that here again. Hereby
[59:46] we know that we dwell in him and he in
[59:49] us. Salvation. We're talking about this.
[59:52] All these verses are 1 John 4 all the
[59:55] way down to verse 18. Salvation.
[59:57] Salvation. Salvation.
[1:00:00] Hereby we know that we dwell in him and
[1:00:02] he in us because he hath given us of his
[1:00:05] spirit. What did he give us of his
[1:00:08] spirit? The spirit of adoption that we
[1:00:10] might come to full maturity
[1:00:13] in this day. 14 And we have seen and do
[1:00:16] testify to that the father sent the son
[1:00:19] to be the savior of the world.
[1:00:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:24] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:00:24] &gt;&gt; Salvation. 15. Whosoever conf shall
[1:00:28] confess that Jesus is the son of God,
[1:00:30] God dwelleth in him, and he in God. I in
[1:00:34] you and you in me. There again,
[1:00:36] salvation. Now, that don't just mean,
[1:00:38] well, I believe Jesus Christ son of God.
[1:00:40] that that's it's got to be a a
[1:00:43] manifestation, a sincerity, a new birth.
[1:00:46] Words could be cheap. You know what I'm
[1:00:48] saying? It's got to be a real word
[1:00:49] birth.
[1:00:50] &gt;&gt; Verse 16. And we have known and believed
[1:00:54] the love of God hath to us. And we have
[1:00:55] known and believed the love that God
[1:00:57] hath to us.
[1:00:59] &gt;&gt; God is love.
[1:01:03] &gt;&gt; And he that dwelleth in love. Now
[1:01:05] dwelleth don't mean come and go in and
[1:01:08] out. Dwelleth means remains. dwelleth
[1:01:11] remain. He that dwelleth in love
[1:01:13] dwelleth in God and God in him. How how
[1:01:17] many times just in these verses I in
[1:01:19] you, you and me. I in you, you and me. I
[1:01:21] in you. In that day, what day? This day
[1:01:24] is this one of the scriptures for our
[1:01:26] day. I you and me. Again,
[1:01:30] verse 17.
[1:01:32] Herein is our love made perfect. Okay.
[1:01:37] Herein
[1:01:40] is our love. God's word, God's love is
[1:01:42] already perfect. Herein is our love made
[1:01:45] perfect that
[1:01:48] we may have boldness in the day of
[1:01:51] judgment. Now let's look at that again.
[1:01:54] Okay, again salvation.
[1:01:56] Okay, first thing you must understand,
[1:01:59] what is the day of judgment? What is the
[1:02:00] day of judgment for the bride? We don't
[1:02:03] have to face him in the judgment. We
[1:02:05] stand with him in the judgment. The
[1:02:08] bride takes her judgment now. The bride
[1:02:11] is judged or purged by the bleeding
[1:02:14] word, by the washing of the water, by
[1:02:16] the word. We take our judgment right
[1:02:19] now. We don't stand at the judgment.
[1:02:21] We're with him in the judgment. We don't
[1:02:23] stand before him to be judged. We have
[1:02:26] received our judgment now.
[1:02:29] &gt;&gt; We must have these revelations.
[1:02:32] &gt;&gt; Okay, here's what brother B said. We we
[1:02:34] believe this to be true. Say, "Well,
[1:02:36] brother Ram, don't we have to stand and
[1:02:38] the judgment is?" No, sir. We do not
[1:02:40] stand before the judgment. We are not we
[1:02:42] are now standing before the judgment.
[1:02:44] God put our sins upon Christ.
[1:02:47] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:02:48] &gt;&gt; He that hearth my words. St. John 5:24.
[1:02:51] How many hundred times did he quote
[1:02:52] that? He that believeth on him has sent
[1:02:54] me has eternal life and shall not come
[1:02:56] into the judgment, but has passed from
[1:02:58] death unto life. No more judgment for
[1:03:00] the church. He's talking about the
[1:03:02] bride. It's tuck up in the rapture and
[1:03:04] comes back to pass judgment on those
[1:03:06] people who did not receive the Holy
[1:03:08] Ghost. So, we understand that's why I
[1:03:10] said only the Holy Ghost is going to
[1:03:12] enter here. We're talking about bride.
[1:03:14] We're talking about rapture. We're
[1:03:15] talking about going living in the city.
[1:03:17] We're talking about the wedding supper.
[1:03:18] We're talking about living in the the
[1:03:19] the eternal kingdom of the new city must
[1:03:23] have the Holy Ghost. Now, there is a
[1:03:25] whosoever will group that don't have the
[1:03:27] Holy Ghost. There's people that are
[1:03:28] given eternal life, but we're talking
[1:03:30] about bride material that's
[1:03:31] predestinated, ordained, and has the
[1:03:33] very life of God, the token, the spirit
[1:03:35] of God in them. Before we leave that
[1:03:38] this before we leave this world
[1:03:41] and brother says in this uh
[1:03:45] well, let me just look at this right
[1:03:47] here
[1:03:48] as we go through the scriptures can
[1:03:50] still try to remember when the bride
[1:03:52] recognizes who she is and what she is,
[1:03:54] then the rapture will go. things that we
[1:03:56] need to remember in that day she used to
[1:03:58] know the eye and you and father so we
[1:03:59] talked about that the token is a literal
[1:04:02] life of Christ we understand the token
[1:04:05] &gt;&gt; do we believe that
[1:04:06] &gt;&gt; amen
[1:04:07] &gt;&gt; the token if you got the token that's
[1:04:08] the literal life of Jesus Christ
[1:04:11] dwelling in you
[1:04:12] &gt;&gt; that's really hard that's really now you
[1:04:14] know the literal life of Christ dwelling
[1:04:17] in my soul yes sir you've got to
[1:04:20] recognize are you worthy of it no
[1:04:23] &gt;&gt; but he gave it to you as a free gift you
[1:04:25] must accept it.
[1:04:27] &gt;&gt; You got to accept it.
[1:04:31] &gt;&gt; Only those with the token baptism of the
[1:04:33] Holy Ghost, a word birth go in the
[1:04:35] rapture. And as I said, only perfect
[1:04:38] love will enter into that place. Now, as
[1:04:42] I just I quoted it, but I'm going to
[1:04:43] read it what he said. And and when he
[1:04:46] had that translation at the end of the
[1:04:47] translation, that voice spoke to him and
[1:04:49] said, "And I heard a voice and spoke to
[1:04:51] me in that room and said, "This is what
[1:04:55] you preach was the Holy Ghost. This is
[1:04:58] perfect love." And nothing can enter
[1:05:00] here without it. I'm more determined
[1:05:03] than ever in my life that it takes
[1:05:04] perfect love to enter there. So it takes
[1:05:07] perfect love to enter there. We must
[1:05:09] have it here.
[1:05:10] &gt;&gt; Then when are we going to get it? the
[1:05:13] day before we leave, two hours before we
[1:05:15] get leave. I can't answer that
[1:05:17] specifically, but I know we got to have
[1:05:19] it before we leave.
[1:05:22] &gt;&gt; And he said, "This is what you preach
[1:05:23] was the Holy Ghost." This what that
[1:05:26] place of perfection. That place of
[1:05:28] perfection, only the Holy Ghost is going
[1:05:30] to with people with the Holy Ghost is
[1:05:31] going to enter that place of perfection.
[1:05:33] And brother Brand said one place he
[1:05:35] said, "You got to be perfect to get
[1:05:36] there in invisible union." and said,
[1:05:38] "How do you ever think to be perfect
[1:05:39] except by the perfect bleeding word that
[1:05:42] God has uh given to us in this day to to
[1:05:45] wash our sins by the washing of the
[1:05:47] water?" By the word, it takes a perfect
[1:05:49] bleach and a perfect son of God to make
[1:05:52] a perfect bride.
[1:05:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:54] &gt;&gt; True. You know, when you think about
[1:05:56] even the word bleach, I looked it up and
[1:05:58] I don't remember if I can remember the
[1:06:00] exact words, but brother M used the
[1:06:02] words bleach from I think 53 few times.
[1:06:06] But for the opening during the the the
[1:06:08] seven seals, he used the words he only
[1:06:11] said it like 47 times on recorded tape,
[1:06:14] but over 30 times he used it during the
[1:06:17] seals. Bleach, bleach, bleach. What is
[1:06:20] the opening of the word? What is the
[1:06:22] opening of the word telling us? You're
[1:06:24] now justified. It's an invisible union
[1:06:28] to the bride of Clyde. What does the
[1:06:29] bleach do? When a drop of ink is dropped
[1:06:32] into that tub of bleach, the ink
[1:06:34] actually becomes the bleach.
[1:06:38] &gt;&gt; Oh boy. What what age are we living in?
[1:06:42] What age are we really living in? That's
[1:06:44] right.
[1:06:45] &gt;&gt; That's why in verse 17 again, herein is
[1:06:48] our love made perfect that we may have
[1:06:51] boldness in that day of judgment. That
[1:06:54] day of judgment for the bride is now.
[1:06:56] Boldness means confidence. And when you
[1:06:59] have boldness, confidence, revelation,
[1:07:02] revelation, assurity that you are sealed
[1:07:05] away in Christ by a word birth of this
[1:07:08] message which is Christ. Then in verse
[1:07:11] 17 says, "As he is, so are we in this
[1:07:15] world." Do you believe that?
[1:07:18] &gt;&gt; I don't know if they they're not putting
[1:07:19] it up there, but he says there,
[1:07:22] "As he is, so are we in this world."
[1:07:26] &gt;&gt; As he is, if we're fulfilling the
[1:07:28] scripture, this scripture with perfect
[1:07:30] love. As he is, so are we in this world.
[1:07:32] I, you, you, and me.
[1:07:34] That really that really sheds a lot of
[1:07:36] light on the authority that God has
[1:07:40] given to his bride.
[1:07:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:42] &gt;&gt; To be the final voice.
[1:07:45] &gt;&gt; Oh mercy.
[1:07:47] &gt;&gt; This this is not just for whosoever
[1:07:49] will. This is not just for anybody. This
[1:07:50] is a chosen bride.
[1:07:52] &gt;&gt; This is a this is a privilege. This is a
[1:07:55] privilege to be chosen to be his bride.
[1:07:58] &gt;&gt; Then verse 17, as he is, so are we in
[1:08:01] this world. again in that day I and the
[1:08:04] father the father he and me and I and
[1:08:06] you and you and me. Now what is bride
[1:08:08] time, harvest time, seed time with the
[1:08:11] open book? The judge is here declaring
[1:08:13] you are absolutely justified as though
[1:08:16] you never did it in the first place. As
[1:08:19] though you never did it in the first
[1:08:20] place. Well, my question, you never did
[1:08:23] it in the first place. When was the
[1:08:24] first place? What was the first place?
[1:08:26] I'll tell you what the first place was.
[1:08:27] that was in the mind of God, in the
[1:08:29] thoughts of God as he saw you as a
[1:08:31] redeemed son of God. And you, we only
[1:08:33] bypass uh our theophony come to this
[1:08:35] earth to be tested and tried. But like
[1:08:37] Job said, where were you?
[1:08:40] &gt;&gt; Where were you?
[1:08:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:42] &gt;&gt; Where were you in the mind of God
[1:08:43] already redeemed, already already set in
[1:08:46] motion, if you will.
[1:08:48] &gt;&gt; We only come down there to be tested and
[1:08:50] tried.
[1:08:51] &gt;&gt; We're playing out the drama. We've got
[1:08:53] to have a revelation of these things.
[1:08:54] really who we are not worthy of it but
[1:08:57] he said it so I accept it
[1:08:59] &gt;&gt; is right
[1:09:00] &gt;&gt; as he is as he is how what you say or as
[1:09:04] he is what is he is pure holy loving
[1:09:09] then so are we in this world we we've
[1:09:11] got quite a challenge sir
[1:09:13] &gt;&gt; being saved from all sin all our sins
[1:09:17] and made like unto himself in righteous
[1:09:19] and true holiness remember what it said
[1:09:21] about the drop of ink it becomes the
[1:09:24] bleach That's right. Amen.
[1:09:26] &gt;&gt; Now, here's another
[1:09:28] challenge I want to make to you.
[1:09:31] You believe you become the righteousness
[1:09:33] of God, the very God, his righteous.
[1:09:36] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:09:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:37] &gt;&gt; Now, your flesh, forget it. Your spirit
[1:09:40] realm, forget it. We're talking about
[1:09:42] your soul.
[1:09:43] &gt;&gt; That's the only thing that's godly about
[1:09:44] us is our soul. The rest of it is just
[1:09:47] that's superfluous. Okay? But brother
[1:09:50] Bram says in in the revelation of Jesus
[1:09:51] Christ, a church age book, this is so
[1:09:53] outsetting and we must don't I wish we
[1:09:56] could put it all up on the screen. The
[1:09:58] Bible says in 2 Corinthians 5:21 that we
[1:10:01] have become the righteous of God by our
[1:10:03] union with Jesus Christ. Do you get it?
[1:10:05] He says that we are the very
[1:10:07] righteousness of God himself by being in
[1:10:10] Christ. It says that he Jesus became sin
[1:10:14] for us. It does not say he became
[1:10:15] sinful, but he became sin for us that by
[1:10:18] our union, invisible union with him, we
[1:10:21] might become the righteousness of God.
[1:10:25] Now listen to this. Now here's the
[1:10:26] challenge. If we accept the fact, and we
[1:10:29] must, that he literally became sin for
[1:10:32] us by his substitution for us, then we
[1:10:35] must also accept the fact that we by our
[1:10:37] union with him have become the very
[1:10:40] righteousness of God. He said to reject
[1:10:43] one is to reject the other. To accept
[1:10:46] one is to accept the other. Now we know
[1:10:49] the Bible says that it can't be nied.
[1:10:52] But brother I'm saying the revelation
[1:10:55] the revelation
[1:10:57] &gt;&gt; of it is missing. It's not real to the
[1:10:59] majority of even God's children.
[1:11:03] &gt;&gt; It's not real to the majority of God's
[1:11:05] children. God's children.
[1:11:08] But he does have elected elected group
[1:11:10] that will have that revelation because
[1:11:12] only perfect love is going to enter that
[1:11:14] place.
[1:11:16] &gt;&gt; But the revelation is missing. It's not
[1:11:18] only it's not real to the majority of
[1:11:20] God's children. It's just a good Bible
[1:11:22] verse. But we need to have it made
[1:11:24] alive. And that will take
[1:11:29] revelation.
[1:11:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:31] &gt;&gt; Revelation.
[1:11:32] &gt;&gt; That is true.
[1:11:32] &gt;&gt; Who gives revelation? There's only one
[1:11:34] gives revelation. I can't give it. Sean
[1:11:38] can't give it.
[1:11:39] &gt;&gt; Amos can't give it. Your wife, your
[1:11:40] husband can't give it. Nobody. Only God.
[1:11:44] &gt;&gt; They can teach you. There's a lot of
[1:11:46] there's a lot of difference between
[1:11:47] revelation and information.
[1:11:51] &gt;&gt; Even many of the the preachers who have
[1:11:53] left left the message, they have a they
[1:11:55] have a lot a lot a wealth a wealth of
[1:11:58] information.
[1:12:00] &gt;&gt; But if they had a revelation, they would
[1:12:02] never left the message.
[1:12:04] &gt;&gt; Yeah. information is wonderful. I love
[1:12:07] it. I love the mysteries, the seals,
[1:12:09] pools, thunders, whatever. But
[1:12:11] revelation, that's what seals us in.
[1:12:14] Brother B said, you're saved by
[1:12:15] revelation.
[1:12:17] Okay, back to the scripture. Verse 7.
[1:12:19] Herein is our love made perfect that we
[1:12:21] may have boldness in the day of judgment
[1:12:23] because as he is, so are we in this
[1:12:26] world. If we don't have a revelation of
[1:12:28] this scripture and this quote, our love
[1:12:31] is not made perfect yet. Remember,
[1:12:34] revelation takes away fear. We must have
[1:12:36] that revelation so that we won't have to
[1:12:40] fear. We won't have to have dread. That
[1:12:42] we won't have to have torment. Now,
[1:12:44] let's talk about just won't too much
[1:12:46] longer. One of the main things I want to
[1:12:48] get to verse 18, s first John 4:18.
[1:12:54] There's no fear in love, but perfect
[1:12:56] love casteth
[1:12:58] out fear. Because fearth have torment,
[1:13:01] he that fearth is not made perfect in
[1:13:04] love.
[1:13:05] &gt;&gt; Let's break down this fear issue just a
[1:13:07] little bit. There is no fear in love,
[1:13:10] but perfect love cast out fear. There's
[1:13:11] a difference between the fear of God
[1:13:15] &gt;&gt; and being afraid of God.
[1:13:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:18] The fear of God is a high regard for
[1:13:21] him, ultimate respect, soberness in his
[1:13:24] presence, absoluteness of his authority,
[1:13:27] extreme loyalty to his word, on and on
[1:13:31] and on. That's the fear. That's the
[1:13:33] right kind of fear. You must have that.
[1:13:35] That's the right kind of fear. But to be
[1:13:38] afraid of God,
[1:13:41] it comes from this.
[1:13:43] To be afraid of God, it comes by some
[1:13:47] measure of guilt.
[1:13:50] Comes by some measure of guilt.
[1:13:55] Now, where does that put things like
[1:13:59] see a forgiveness,
[1:14:01] true repentance,
[1:14:03] revelation, you've been forgiven.
[1:14:05] &gt;&gt; All of these things
[1:14:07] cannot be no guilt. That's why we're
[1:14:10] teaching on this tonight. Perfect love
[1:14:13] casteth out fear.
[1:14:16] &gt;&gt; Fear have torment.
[1:14:18] &gt;&gt; If you have fear and torment, you're not
[1:14:20] made perfect in love. It's gonna take
[1:14:22] perfect love to get there.
[1:14:24] &gt;&gt; So, this is very, very important
[1:14:25] tonight. To be afraid of God, it comes
[1:14:28] from some measure of guilt. Now, listen
[1:14:31] friends, I'm gonna tell you,
[1:14:34] &gt;&gt; this message is so tremendous.
[1:14:37] Uh when I was in the Air Force, I bought
[1:14:40] a couple of motorcycles, but I bought
[1:14:42] one motorcycle and uh Honda 350 Scramler
[1:14:47] uh gave me the the guy $450. I paid him
[1:14:50] $400. Said, "I I don't have the rest of
[1:14:52] it. I'll pay it to you soon as I get it
[1:14:55] in the next two or three weeks,
[1:14:56] whatever, like that." Guess what? The
[1:14:58] guy got transferred. He moved. Don't
[1:15:00] even know the guy's name. He's gone
[1:15:02] forever, right?
[1:15:03] &gt;&gt; I owe him $50. I wasn't saved at the
[1:15:06] time. I got saved. I owed him $50.
[1:15:11] Well, God forgive me. Yeah, God forgive
[1:15:13] me, but I couldn't forgive him. I owed
[1:15:15] him. And now, that's not the worst thing
[1:15:16] I've ever done. That's not the worst
[1:15:18] thing. But that this one haunted me.
[1:15:21] Even after I got saved going to the
[1:15:22] Pentecostal Holiness Church for 10
[1:15:24] years.
[1:15:25] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Yeah.
[1:15:27] &gt;&gt; I couldn't get a revelation that I
[1:15:29] couldn't get a revelation that I truly
[1:15:31] did not have
[1:15:34] freedom that I was remitted. My sins
[1:15:37] were remitted. When I came into this
[1:15:39] message and I got a revelation of true
[1:15:42] justification, it was over. Finished.
[1:15:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:15:45] &gt;&gt; None. Zero.
[1:15:47] But it took a revelation of what God's
[1:15:51] love for me that I could reciprocate
[1:15:53] back with my love towards God and accept
[1:15:55] the fact that he loved me enough.
[1:15:57] Forgive me. Been much worse things we've
[1:16:00] all done.
[1:16:01] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:16:02] &gt;&gt; But that's the one thing that haunted
[1:16:04] me. Why? I don't know.
[1:16:06] &gt;&gt; But it's under the blood. Hey, if I if I
[1:16:08] can meet the guy today, I'd pay him the
[1:16:10] money.
[1:16:11] &gt;&gt; I'd pay him the money.
[1:16:12] &gt;&gt; But if I never meet him on this side,
[1:16:14] it's under the blood. It's gone. It's
[1:16:16] finished. Amen.
[1:16:17] &gt;&gt; That's a revelation. That's a revelation
[1:16:19] of justification as though you never did
[1:16:22] it. God knew that before he chose me in
[1:16:24] from the foundation of the world.
[1:16:27] &gt;&gt; Okay. Lack of revelation. Lack of
[1:16:29] revelation of forgiveness.
[1:16:31] Misunderstanding. This is a bad kind of
[1:16:33] fear. Why are we afraid of God?
[1:16:35] Misunderstanding of grace versus works.
[1:16:38] Grace versus works.
[1:16:41] Yeah.
[1:16:42] &gt;&gt; Back in the Pentecostal holiness church,
[1:16:44] I mean it was works, works, works,
[1:16:46] works, works.
[1:16:47] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:16:48] &gt;&gt; No, this kind of fear is a dread for the
[1:16:51] day of judgment. Also comes from
[1:16:54] feelings and not faith.
[1:16:57] This kind of fear have torment. If you
[1:17:00] have these kinds of fears, your love has
[1:17:03] not been made perfect yet. Amen.
[1:17:05] &gt;&gt; A perfect love for God and with God
[1:17:08] casted out all fear and being lost or
[1:17:11] rejected. A perfect love for God will
[1:17:15] give you and it will cast out all your
[1:17:18] fears of being lost or ever being
[1:17:19] rejected. A perfect love for I'm talking
[1:17:21] about a perfect love for God. I mean,
[1:17:23] brother man said you can love God and be
[1:17:24] lost, but I'm talking about a perfect
[1:17:26] love for God. A perfect love for God
[1:17:28] will res will believe and receive what
[1:17:31] he has promised for you. He loved you so
[1:17:34] much say I forgive you of your sin. Then
[1:17:36] you if you don't accept it a pardon is
[1:17:39] not a pardon unless it be received as a
[1:17:40] pardon.
[1:17:42] In other words,
[1:17:45] a worshipper once purged has no more
[1:17:47] conscious of sin. In other words, he
[1:17:49] feels no more guilt for past sins and
[1:17:52] has no more desire for sin. Isn't that a
[1:17:54] beautiful scripture? A worshipper must a
[1:17:57] worshipper uh
[1:17:59] &gt;&gt; once purged has no more conscious of
[1:18:02] sin. No more desire for sin. No more
[1:18:04] guilt of sin. It's all under the blood.
[1:18:07] &gt;&gt; He feels no more guilt.
[1:18:10] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:18:10] &gt;&gt; Now, if when you feel no more guilt for
[1:18:13] what we've done, now we're coming into
[1:18:14] that perfect love realm because God
[1:18:17] desired that you'll have no dread, no
[1:18:20] fear.
[1:18:20] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:18:22] &gt;&gt; And no guilt.
[1:18:24] &gt;&gt; Now, we had better, now we have a better
[1:18:27] understanding. Let's put it that way.
[1:18:29] Why? The angel said, "This is what you
[1:18:31] preach with the Holy Ghost. This is
[1:18:34] perfect love." And it will take perfect
[1:18:36] love to enter that place. So now we
[1:18:38] understand perfect love castes out fear
[1:18:41] of that's of the soul. But what about of
[1:18:44] the body and the flesh?
[1:18:48] If the musicians will come, let's just
[1:18:51] suppose,
[1:18:53] let's don't suppose that the love of So
[1:18:56] let's don't suppose that the love of God
[1:18:58] or perfect love casts out all kinds of
[1:19:00] fear because it doesn't. We still have
[1:19:02] fears of dangers, storms, emergency,
[1:19:06] preservation of life, natural fears,
[1:19:09] fears of having an accident on the
[1:19:11] highway, fears the fears of failure,
[1:19:13] mind battles. But even with all these
[1:19:16] natural fears that everybody has with
[1:19:18] our flesh and our spirit, not salvation,
[1:19:20] not soul, flesh and spirit, we must
[1:19:23] remember this one scripture right here.
[1:19:25] Romans 8:35-39.
[1:19:28] Very, very, very, very familiar. But
[1:19:31] don't never forget these scriptures just
[1:19:34] for the natural fears that we have in
[1:19:37] this natural life. Not the soul, but
[1:19:40] spirit and flesh.
[1:19:42] Who shall separate us
[1:19:44] &gt;&gt; from the love of Christ? Tribulation,
[1:19:48] distress, persecution,
[1:19:51] famine, nakedness, peril, sword.
[1:19:57] As it is, as it is written, for thy sake
[1:19:59] we are killed all the day long. We are
[1:20:02] counted as sheep for the slaughter. Nay,
[1:20:06] in all these things we are more than
[1:20:09] conquerors through him that loved us. In
[1:20:13] all of these things we're more than
[1:20:14] conquer in all of these things.
[1:20:18] Doesn't the Bible teach us all things
[1:20:21] work together for it doesn't say good
[1:20:24] because all things are not good but it
[1:20:26] says all things work together for the
[1:20:28] good.
[1:20:29] Whole lot of difference between good and
[1:20:31] the good. All things work together for
[1:20:34] the good of that who love God, who are
[1:20:36] called according to his purpose. Nay, in
[1:20:40] all these things, we are more than
[1:20:41] conquerors through him that loved us.
[1:20:43] Brother Sean, come on up. For I am
[1:20:46] persuaded that neither death nor life
[1:20:51] nor angels nor principalities, all the
[1:20:54] things that we face in layout see
[1:20:57] &gt;&gt; nor powers nor things present nor things
[1:21:01] to come.
[1:21:03] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:21:04] &gt;&gt; Neither height nor depth. He covers
[1:21:07] everything. He covers it all.
[1:21:10] nor any other creature shall be able to
[1:21:12] separate us from the love of God which
[1:21:16] is in Christ Jesus. Nothing. Nothing.
[1:21:20] You're sealed in. Satan's sealed out.
[1:21:23] Are you going to have sickness? Yes. Are
[1:21:24] you going to have mind battles? Yes. Are
[1:21:26] you going to have troubles? Yes. But
[1:21:28] nothing can separate us from the love of
[1:21:30] God. But when we're truly born again,
[1:21:34] know that you pass from death to life,
[1:21:36] have a word birth, there's no
[1:21:37] condemnation, there's no dread, there is
[1:21:40] there's no fearfulness that I'm going to
[1:21:42] miss the rapture, I'm sealed in. If we
[1:21:46] want to say it in common language, I'm
[1:21:47] as good as there.
[1:21:50] That's just that's just the way God
[1:21:51] wrote it. That's just the way God's word
[1:21:53] is. That's why this message is so
[1:21:56] tremendous. There's nothing like it.
[1:22:00] So when a person truly truly is birthed
[1:22:03] into the kingdom of God by a word birth
[1:22:05] and truly has the genuine love of God,
[1:22:07] God's own life in their heart, the new
[1:22:10] birth is a revelation. And that
[1:22:12] revelation removes all dread, removes
[1:22:15] all fear, removes all torment. That's
[1:22:17] right.
[1:22:18] &gt;&gt; This is what you preached was the Holy
[1:22:21] Ghost.
[1:22:22] &gt;&gt; You love him. Let's stand. God bless
[1:22:25] you.
[1:22:34] Oh,
[1:22:40] like
[1:22:43] Jesus,
[1:22:45] make
[1:22:47] me more
[1:22:50] like thee.
[1:22:54] Oh, give me a heart
[1:23:00] that's filled
[1:23:02] with love
[1:23:05] and make
[1:23:07] me more
[1:23:10] like thee. Can you sing it as a prayer?
[1:23:15] Oh, make
[1:23:17] me more
[1:23:20] like thee.
[1:23:24] Jesus,
[1:23:26] make
[1:23:28] me more
[1:23:30] like thee.
[1:23:36] Oh, give me a heart
[1:23:41] that's filled
[1:23:43] with love
[1:23:46] and make
[1:23:48] me more
[1:23:51] like thee.
[1:23:54] Did you enjoy the service tonight?
[1:23:58] Amen.
[1:24:00] divine love.
[1:24:04] Thought of when brother Granham faced
[1:24:07] that bull, faced the the man, faced the
[1:24:10] hornets, them different things.
[1:24:14] It wasn't something that he could do
[1:24:16] himself.
[1:24:18] It was something that came to him. It
[1:24:21] was a love that only God could do.
[1:24:26] And because God is love, it's it's a
[1:24:30] supernatural thing. And I believe that's
[1:24:32] what's happening
[1:24:34] within us. It's it's God
[1:24:38] growing. And that revelation that
[1:24:41] Brother Terry was talking about, it's
[1:24:44] something that is taking place on a
[1:24:46] daily
[1:24:48] thing that we're coming more in
[1:24:51] connection with God. Amen. And uh such a
[1:24:54] revelation.
[1:24:56] Amen. And that's that's something that
[1:24:59] you know people want to say, well this
[1:25:01] message come from brother Brandham or
[1:25:04] it's it's man's idea or we're following
[1:25:07] a man. It's truly not. It's actually God
[1:25:12] revealing his mind to us and his life.
[1:25:16] It's we're it's an infusion, I guess, of
[1:25:19] of God coming into us and we becoming
[1:25:22] more godlike and the revelation of God
[1:25:25] is just becoming so real to us that it's
[1:25:29] imparting a divine love. I thought of,
[1:25:33] you know, just something simple like
[1:25:36] brother Brandham said. He goes, I am, he
[1:25:38] goes, he's a real God, isn't he? I'm so
[1:25:42] glad he can look over our mistakes.
[1:25:46] Aren't you? He said it makes us love him
[1:25:50] with all of our heart. It's just the
[1:25:53] things that God is doing and the things
[1:25:56] we're seeing God do and God making
[1:25:58] himself known to us. It's it's just all
[1:26:02] it's doing. It's creating such love
[1:26:04] within us. Amen. That we can love him,
[1:26:07] love one another. And I'm I'm so glad
[1:26:11] for that. I really appreciated that,
[1:26:13] Brother Terry. Amen. And um Amen. And I
[1:26:17] just pray that God just keeps revealing
[1:26:21] himself more and more. And I really like
[1:26:23] that uh what brother, you know, the
[1:26:25] example that brother Terry gave uh being
[1:26:29] lost or not lost but out broke down out
[1:26:32] in the the the Colorado and just stand
[1:26:36] straight with that word or that road.
[1:26:39] And I thought, you know what, that's
[1:26:41] true. Just stay with the message. It'll
[1:26:44] bring you through. You say, "Well, man,
[1:26:46] I'm sure lacking." Just stay with the
[1:26:48] message. Stay true. Don't go this way.
[1:26:53] Don't go that way. Everything else looks
[1:26:55] great. There might be an oasis for you
[1:26:58] somewhere's out there, and you might be
[1:26:59] going through some troubles and all
[1:27:01] that, but just stay right with the
[1:27:03] message. It'll bring you through. Can
[1:27:06] you say amen? And I love the Lord. Amen.
[1:27:10] And I certainly want uh amen to apply
[1:27:14] the word of God to my life. Amen. And um
[1:27:18] let's just sing this um uh song. Oh, how
[1:27:22] he loves you and me. Amen.
[1:27:27] Oh, how he loves you and me.
[1:27:37] Oh, how
[1:27:40] he loves you and me.
[1:27:48] He gave his life.
[1:27:53] What more
[1:27:55] could he give?
[1:27:59] Oh, how he loves you.
[1:28:04] Oh, how he loves me.
[1:28:09] Oh, how he loves you and me.
[1:28:16] Sing it again.
[1:28:19] Oh, how
[1:28:22] he loves you.
[1:28:25] It's what the Bible says herein is love
[1:28:29] that he first loved us.
[1:28:32] Hallelujah. It all begins with God.
[1:28:37] He is love. He revealed it to us by
[1:28:40] coming being made flesh. Oh, how it
[1:28:45] makes us love him.
[1:28:48] Oh,
[1:28:50] oh, how he loves you.
[1:28:56] Oh, how he loves me.
[1:29:01] Oh, how he loves you and me.
[1:29:10] May you
[1:29:11] keep these words in your heart. Amen.
[1:29:15] And just ponder over them. If there's
[1:29:18] any condemnation, anything in your
[1:29:20] heart, just say, "Oh, God, take that
[1:29:23] from me and help me truly understand
[1:29:27] your love."
[1:29:30] Amen. Is that what you want God to do?
[1:29:33] Amen. And you know, as um we may not be
[1:29:38] able to have um service uh Sunday, we
[1:29:42] just play it by ear. Hopefully we can,
[1:29:44] but uh looks like we're going to get a
[1:29:48] lot of snow, but they're they're brother
[1:29:51] Random called them weather prophets.
[1:29:53] Amen. and uh you know and we get
[1:29:57] prepared because of what they're saying
[1:29:59] but we've been given a a word prophet in
[1:30:03] this age and uh
[1:30:06] and it's right on too. whatever he says
[1:30:09] it's right on the forecast is right and
[1:30:13] so we don't know about this other but it
[1:30:16] does look like it's going to be a lot of
[1:30:18] snow but uh whatever the Lord gives then
[1:30:21] we'll take and I pray that God just
[1:30:24] protects you keeps you safe and uh may
[1:30:30] your power electricity not go out. Amen.
[1:30:34] and uh if but I hope you got uh wood and
[1:30:39] food and be prepared for whatever comes.
[1:30:42] But more than anything, may God be with
[1:30:44] you and keep you. And uh we'll let you
[1:30:47] know. Uh I guess we'll just keep an eye
[1:30:50] on the weather and uh but um if we don't
[1:30:53] get to meet Sunday, hopefully we'll get
[1:30:55] to meet uh Wednesday and um whenever we

[1:31:03] one another. Uh, good to have brother

[1:31:19] uh just everyone uh that been sick over
[1:31:22] the weekend and good to have you all uh
[1:31:26] back with us. We want to just keep those
[1:31:28] that are still sick in our prayer and
[1:31:30] that the Lord will uh just help them to
[1:31:34] recover and uh help us that's not been
[1:31:37] sick to keep sidest stepping this thing.

[1:32:23] count. We want to make sure beyond a
[1:32:27] shadow of a doubt that we're following
[1:32:30] the will of God in every part of our
[1:32:32] life. Amen. God bless you. And uh let's
[1:32:36] just bow our heads in a word of prayer.
[1:32:40] Father,
[1:32:42] we're so thankful that we've had a
[1:32:45] forecast in this age
[1:32:48] that would let us know the events
[1:32:51] that are transpiring today. And it may
[1:32:56] seem chaotic to the world and it may
[1:32:58] just seem
[1:33:00] a whole mess, but Father, we see it as
[1:33:03] prophecy being fulfilled.
[1:33:06] We see everything getting ready
[1:33:09] for a rapture to take place.
[1:33:12] And Father, we're so thankful that
[1:33:14] you've revealed your love to us,
[1:33:18] Lord, to let us know that we are secure
[1:33:21] in you. And there's no death, no
[1:33:26] trial, there's no nothing that could
[1:33:29] take us from that love, Lord.
