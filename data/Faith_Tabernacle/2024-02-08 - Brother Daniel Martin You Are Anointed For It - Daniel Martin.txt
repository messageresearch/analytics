thank you Lord for your anointing tonight in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen you can have your B Bibles amen thank you musicians if we could uh turn to uh 1 Samuel amen I'm not going to promise you anything but I'm going to try not to keep you long tonight I know it's a Wednesday night but 1 Samuel 17 1 Samuel 17:31 and it says and when the words were heard which David spake they rehearsed them before Saul and he sent for him and David said to Saul let no man's heart fail because of him thy servant will go and fight with this Philistine and Saul said to David thou are not able to go against this Phil to fight with him for thou are but a youth and a man uh and he a man of war from his Youth and David said unto Saul thy servant kept his father's sheep and there came a lion and a bear and took a lamb out of the flock and I went after him and smokee him and delivered it out of his mouth and when he arose against me I caught him by his beard and I smote him and slew him thy servant slew both The Lion and the Bear and this uncircumcised Philistine shall be as one of them seeing he hath defied the armies of the Living God David said moreover the Lord that delivered me out of the Paw of the lion and out of the Paw of the bear he will deliver me out of the hand of this Philistine amen you can be seated amen if I were to um give a title uh tonight I would like to maybe title it U you you were anointed for it and um so we see that David was a man after God's Own Heart and uh you know David uh was positionally he was POS positionally born by election and uh he was born elected as a servant of God Amen and when he was a little boy Israel had during that time had gotten away from God and uh they went out and chose them self a king uh they wanted to act brother brandham says they wanted to act like the rest of the Nations um they and U God was their King but they wanted to act like the rest of the people the hats when they got in trouble brother brandham said and they tried to be something they wasn't and whenever you're trying to impersonate someone else you can always expect trouble to be with there with you amen and if Israel had just stayed in that condition uh but they said well now looky here the rest of the Nations has got a king so why can't we have a king brother brandham says that's what the Pentecostal people thought well the rest of the churches they got all their show they go to the shows and their women they cut their hair and they wear their short dresses and they say they're Christians why can't we and uh brother brandham says an old Methodist preacher used to sing we let down the bars we compromised with sin we let down the bars and the Sheep got out but how did the goats get in because you let down the bars amen and now Israel wanted to impersonate uh other people and that's what the church wants to do is to impersonate uh um and become a b and become a uh backsliding condition they wanted to become something they wasn't and uh um and they got them um and and in this condition they they said what what do they do and and they got them a king and when they did they found the biggest most handsome man they could find great big seven-footer with black shaggy hair and dark sparkling eyes that would uh that would be attractive to the people and they thought well he would make a wonderful King and as God said to Samuel man lookth on the outward appearance but God lookth to the heart amen so when Israel selected their King they wanted a great big handsome strongl looking fellow with great big shoulders that could stand straight stand Head and Shoulders above all of his army and when God selected his King for them when God selected a king he was a little old Ruddy fellow he was a little sapling looking kind of fellow like uh look like he a little brother brandham said and that's what God's pick uh of it was and what a difference that is why while everyone was looking for someone that looked handsome and strong and big built and uh goodlooking good uh looking to the eye but God chose someone else God had a decision and his decision was something that just that that anyone would just throw away no one would want on them on his team you know when uh uh sometimes when we play sports or something or volleyball or something with the church we want to pick the best cuz we want to win so we want someone who knows how to just do it just right right and so when they chose their King they wanted someone who knew how to fight they wanted someone who knew uh their uh uh knew who was very skilled and they also wanted someone that had the looks amen and they see seen how tall he was and they said wow what a man well this guy would be good for a king and uh so uh you know and but God when he chose a king he didn't want someone that just looked pretty to the eyes but he looked at David's heart he said this is the man after my own heart amen man and the doctor will say you know well you're going to die with cancer you'll never recover well that's the doctor's opinion and he's looking it as from a medical standpoint but see God's standpoint is I'm the Lord that Health thee amen one looks at it from one way the other looks at it from another way and looks at it from wisdom sense and the other looks at it from a spiritual sense amen so it's just uh it's just whichever way you base your faith right amen if the doctor says it and it's finished and you believe that then that settles it that's all you're going to receive that's all you're going to get but if the doctor says it's finished and you don't believe it because God said something different Watch What Happens and see just depends on which way you Let Yourself Go amen who you yield your members to that's whose servants you are amen now Saul when he was chosen a great fellow fine looking strapping uh straight shoulder oh great Head and Shoulder above the his whole army they said that's our King and that uh and what did it lead them to it finally LED them to a backslid condition their King backslid my and now when God sees that their choice was no good God went to choose himself a king amen so he told Samuel he said fill up the horn with oil and go out to Jesse and call uh uh his sons up and I'll tell you who I have chosen to be king amen so uh Samuel went out there and Jesse thought too like Samuel rather the oldest one of them would would come out and this great big fine young fellow a big strapping looking fellow he said this is the one that will be king So when Samuel went out he asked Jesse said bring out your sons I'd like to see them all and one by one you know they all just just tall they just all just just handsome looking and and and and Jesse and and Samuel said well surely this is the one surely this is the one to be king and that's what happened to the world today they have turned down a real simple Gospel of Jesus Christ and went out for something great scholarly uh educated and smart and shrewd that studied psychology and got bachelor's degree and all them other things and it's gotten us to a place how we want big things oh man we want to we want to go to the biggest church there is in the city we want to uh we only say Amen to our favorite preacher you know and and we want the biggest church and and many times just exactly like Israel did when they chose Saul Head and Shoulders above everything else you know that's the way you get in trouble right amen when you start looking at the big things when you start looking at your at your wealth when you start looking at the fine things of the world that's when you're going to get in trouble amen but the very principle that he set for us to do we've let down and took secondarily my we have built great hospitals schools and great places and seminars and and educated our preachers to make them so they can speak with fine swell words and use psychology and what has it gotten us a great big bunch of backsliding people hey man nothing but a backsliding people my amen and uh so when uh sorry my uh my notes so when Saul went to Samuel went out to choose them a king you know uh he wanted the great big things he was looking at at the great uh uh at what uh of what he thought would be king I mean you know Saul Saul was great big and handsome you know so so he was like well you know surely this is what we're going to have to do you know we'll just take another big handsome fellow you know and uh um but see and it's but it's gotten us back to a bunch sliding people amen satisfied with just God sending a prophet people are just satisfied with just God sending a prophet they're just satisfied with going to church and being a bench warmer can you imagine people are just satisfied at just sitting in the on a bench and just coming in warming up the bench and then when service is over well you know they they they they they just kept the bench warm you know and and satisfied with just justification satisfied with just sanctification but never come into the baptism of the Holy Ghost my you know uh well God God God just don't do that them things no more amen let me tell you something he's the same yesterday as he was today and he will be the same forever amen if he can feel me with the Holy Ghost he can feel brother Amos and if he can feel brother Amos he can feel brother Bill he can do the same for sister Faith for brother shemiah amen our God is the same yesterday today and forever amen my God will never fail amen God told Samuel said get a cruise of oil and go out there and I'll tell you who to anoint well Jesse come out there and brought his eldest son out which is the great uh which is a great big six-footer or better said that's the one to be king and he passed by Samuel got the uh old cruise and said surely that's him and and when when he passed by God said no that's not him I've refused him he uh my he said well this fellow is nearly his size we'll bring him out he's a big handsome looking fellow he's he looks good with the crown he'll look good with the crown setting on his head and on his side of his head with a new suit on and how you uh uh how look to stand before the people and that's the way the people judges their pastors today brother brandham says what a shame you know and and so when he passed by Samuel got his Cruise of oil and run out to pour it on him and he said don't receive him I've refused him and he kept on bringing them out until he got down to the seventh one that was it and Samuel said well is this all you got is this all you got and Jesse said no I've got I've got one more we're not going to sit down till we go get them so they went back there and and I can see them brother Bram says now some of them with a great discouraged look on their face thinking well surely that wouldn't be the King David come running you know little old Shaggy little little boy come running down and then Jesse says well that's him right there he's he's my last one Samuel well surely he's not going to be the king surely not surely God hasn't chosen him why he's just he's puny he's little well he ain't worth but he can probably barely handle a sword you know notice uh brother BR says I can see David then here he comes running in with a Little Shepherd's coat on made out of sheep skin perhaps he runs in a a little old looking boy the Bible said he was ready and he wasn't nothing but just a little old spinley fellow kind of a little Fair Lookout little B old fellow running there and the Holy Ghost come upon the prophet and said pour the oil on his head I've chose him what a disappointment it was to them people standing there expecting these big men these big handsome strong looking fellows to be the king but he poured the oil on little old David's head and from that day the Holy Spirit was with David and God chose him and God was with David heyen see the world has chosen their soul to be king they chose their money amen but Rapture ain't going to get you or money ain't going to get you in the Rapture amen they they uh I seen this video the other day uh this this preacher got on there and he this was a legit video he gets on there before his people and he says the reason why the Rapture ain't happened yet is because you guys ain't given enough I just that blew my mind see they're just focused on their money that's all they're not worried about the people they just they just build the big churches so they can get more people in to pay more ties my the world chose their big churches they chose their fine speakers who spent years in a seminar they judge a a preacher by uh how many title he can you believe that well this preacher has PhD has his PhD and this one went to the Bible College and went to seminar and that one while he must be a real man of God Amen but when what has it done it's put the people in a backsliding condition they're trying to get the people to Christ by porting them to a social clubs trying to hold the young people by bringing in the uh the games in the church holding them to traditions and well uh it's been taught for many years why change it now amen Christ don't identify himself with Traditions God don't identify himself with video games God don't identify himself with show Social Clubs and formalities amen Christ is the word he identifies himself with the word amen do you believe that amen Christ is the word brother Bram says that the angel of the Lord accompanies this message Jo alwayss that is why we believe this message that is why we stand on this message amen preachers want to try and separate Christ with Christ in the message they want to try to separate the two well they say well we'll get them to a Baptist idea and then bring him to Christ it don't work oh it don't work you can't do it Christ in the message is one amen you want to start seeing God move in your life get under the message you want to see God move in your homes get under the message you want to see God move on your on your job site get under the message amen this message is life to us amen God accompanies this message always God Amen the people forsook God and forsook their King and chose a man to lead them and Saul LED them into a backsliding condition so God said I will choose a king I will do the choosing for this this time so what did he choose he chose a man after his own heart see what happens when God does the choosing it's different when God does the choosing amen he doesn't look for big muscles he doesn't look for H popularity he doesn't look for uh the prettiest or best lookest person but he chooses a person with character he chooses a person after his own heart oh my David wasn't big bad and buff David had god with him amen he was a scrawny little fellow but he was chosen for a purpose and if I can tell you tonight you're chosen for a purpose and it's the same today the world has made their decision and they've rejected God they've chosen the leadership of a man's idea instead of the word so God said I will do the choosing in the last days I will pour my spirit out on my my my people I will pour my anointing out on my people John 15:16 says you have not chosen me but I have chosen you and I have ordained you I have anointed you amen he's anointed you for a purpose he's anointed you for a purpose amen amen you may not look pretty in the world's eyes you may not be the richest or the most powerful worldl person in the world but he's chosen you for a purpose he's poured out his anointing on you for a reason amen don't question God just take God at his word amen amen believe it so this little boy David was born in the world for a purpose amen do you believe that amen he know God was with him brother Bram says he was a crackshot he was a Woodsman he had a little slingshot out there and and bear one day run in and grabbed a little sheep and started out with it and David took his sling and knocked the lion down and took the Sheep right out of its mouth and when the lion come to himself and Rose David caught by the beard and took his hunting knife to him and that ended it he killed the bear also and he knew God was with him if you're going to come after the enemy you must first know that God is with you amen and now the next thing he did he played and cast out Devils if that ain't a Spirit-filled man I never seen one he might be a little and ready but he was a Spirit-filled man God was with him and then the first thing you know there broke out a war and the Philistines come out and he said well we're just going to have war with Israel and Saul called up uh and Saul got all amen uh so he said we're going to uh get uh saw God all of his people his army together sent that little old Ruddy boy back over the hillside to watch Daddy's sheep and so uh then he sent the big Warriors out to fight the battle so that little old fellow can't fight said we put him back out there with the Sheep so we'll just send these great big men out there to do the job so he sent all those boys and out and give them the uh uh give them a sword and so forth and their Spears and they were trained Warriors they were out there with all their phds and everything to fight the battle the enemy's always there to challenge them and let me tell you something the enemy is always going to be there to challenge you so you must always know know the weapon to you or use amen and uh so there come big fellows out there Goliath 9 foot 3 in tall great big fellow walked out there said I'll make you a proposition why should all these men die said send me a man here and let me fight him and if he kills me we'll be your servants and if I kill him why you'll be our servants sure the enemy when he's got the edge on you he likes to boast and carry on like that oh he gives a big boast so every one of them all of them uh all them uh big degrees why they were shivering they were scared of the fellow cuz he was a big man so he boasted like that for 40 days Amen brother Bram says God's uh uh uh 40 is God's number of Temptation so he so he stood there for 40 days boasting and and claiming that he was going to destroy them and and just called them nasty names and and all kinds of things amen and then Jesse went out and got his little boy and said David go over there and some bread and parch corn and so forth and go up and find them uh and see how the boys are so David gets his little donkey and Saddles them up and throws uh parched corn and bread on it and uh away he went to the battle well about that time he got over there to the battle why that morning they was all standing out there both armies scared Goliath walked out there that morning with all of his great big pounds and after pounds of breast plate on and his big shin guards and everything walked out there and made this great big boast I defy the armies of the Israel and it happened to fall on the wrong ears that morning for them there was a little old fellow standing there out there and he knew where he was at amen he knew where where he was at and what we need tonight is somebody else who knows where they're at tonight what we need tonight is men and women uh that know their position in Christ and when the devil makes his big boast sure he makes his big boast but he's still making his boast today we still got Goliath today amen he made his big boast and it fell on the wrong years a little old fellow walking around there he had to look up and see uh he's a man man like that but he knew he was elected by God and that he had the anointing upon him he put God to a test and he knowed who was uh who God was he knowed where he was standing amen notice David was called and elected uh he was called and elected and anointed for for a purpose amen he was positionally placed amen how many Christians here how many Christians do we have here tonight amen see you're a Christian you're not a Christian by your desire you're a Christian by God's desire John 6:44 says no man can come to me except my father first draws him you see you was elected by God before the foundation of the world you didn't do anything to Merit salvation you didn't do anything good enough you didn't say enough prayers to Merit salvation you didn't do enough Deeds you didn't do enough to memorize you didn't have to memorize the whole entire Bible you didn't have to just quote quotes after quotes after quotes to be uh chosen by God but it was God who was rich in Mercy that came and gave you his anointing it's not a guessing game anymore we don't have to guess who we are amen once you know who you are and where you come from where you're going that settles it Amen brother Brenham says first thing you was elected called then when God elected you then he called you and you heeded to his call then he poured the anointing oil on you the Holy Ghost amen what does the oil represent in the Bible the holy spirit amen when he poured the oil upon David he baptized him with the Holy Spirit in a symol form he poured out the whole uh the oil upon him just when he went over uh whole horn full is not sparingly and that's the way God pours the holy ghost on a man not not sparingly just baptize him into it anointing him with the spirit and let me tell you something he didn't anoint you just just to get through Monday he didn't anoint you just to get through Tuesday he didn't anoint you to get you through Wednesday and then you're sitting duck for the rest of the week but he anointed you for the whole week amen he poured his anointing upon you that lasted through Monday through Tuesday through Wednesday amen his anointing is everlasting God doesn't anoint someone and just to leave them he didn't just pick us up to let us down he didn't teach us to swim to let us drown right amen amen he didn't pour pour enough just to get through one day but he poured through enough to get us through a month to get us through two months to get us through a year to get us through 5 years to get us through the rest of our lives till the Rapture comes amen and when the anointing stuck him he was positionally placed as king amen his mercies are new every morning you are placed positionally in Christ Jesus as Kings and Priests amen is that right amen the moment you receive the Holy Ghost God places you in the Kingdom as an heir that's true I know what the gospel does to a person when he really gets a hold of them I've seen it done when the gospel gets a hold of a person it just don't it don't make them still crave the things of the world but when the gospel truly gets a hold of someone when that anointing truly gets a hold of someone it changes the life forever this message changes lives amen it makes you look different it makes you act different it makes you dress different it makes you walk different you're different all the way around amen you didn't have to try to act different the message already Makes You Different amen and that's what happened with David they knew he was different than the rest of them yeah oh my them fellows up there couldn't understand it but David had the anointing oil on him he know where he was standing God uh old Goliath stood out there and he said now look let's reason why there's no need of God's Army arm is being uh defeated well look at that fellow standing out there with this with his big boast uh David said well we know God did it but the days of Miracle has passed but not for David amen he was anointed he know where he was stand in positionally amen David said you mean to tell me that that that you let that uncircumcised Philistines stand there and defy the armies of the Living God why he said I'll never stand for that and so his brother said I know you're naughty heart you come down to watch this battle and so forth and he said up to uh and he come up to Saul and Saul said bring the kid up here then words got up to uh David was was uh uh talking back and saying you let me do it you let me go fight him well the words reached the king and Saul says D I want David and David said uh and bring the kid up here let's see what he looks like he brought him up there little old bitty fell he said well you can't fight that man why why why he could perhaps pick you up in one hand and hold you out he said but listen Saul he says I trust in the Lord and I know even the uh way long ago I I took my slingshot and I K and and I killed a lion and I killed a bear and I took them things right out there and the and the and the lamb right out of their mouths and when he arose up I smoted him I killed him and he said how much more is that uncircumcised Philistine in my hand God will deliver him into my hand and he said maybe you have a great giant maybe you have a great giant here in your life tonight and Satan keeps telling you that this giant is too big that this giant is just too much for you to handle but amen let me remind you of who you are just say Satan I've been anointed by God I have the Lord's anointing you've been been boasting long enough man Satan gets a little loud sometimes man he likes to tell us that we don't we we are nothing yeah man he tells me every day that that God Don't Love You tells me every day that that God don't don't don't need you amen but those those are battles those are giants we've got to fight amen he says I took a lion and I took a bear and I smoked him heyen Satan you've been boasting long enough I've taken a line I've taken a bear I've taken that back pain I've taken them leg pains I've taken h cancer I've taken this and I've defeated him what is this giant to me I smoked that bear I smoked that lion what is this giant to me what is cancer to me what is cancer to God take God out his word amen cancer isn't too hard for God no brain tumor is too hard for God they're just another Giant and when you can take the unadulterated word of God and stand on it you can look at cancer in the eye and declare Victory you canot look tumor in the eye and declare Victory amen why because he's anointed you for it you are anointed for it amen Saul said well you're going to go then you need to put on my armor so he gave David his own thoughts he gave David his own reasoning he gave his own ideas of why brother Brandon missed it here why he missed it there come on now well that's just brother brandom's opinion well that's what Saul was telling David well you know here you take this and you know you know it didn't work for me so maybe it'll work for you you know and David trying to put this on the helmet was just blocking his view the armor made it look like he was just wearing a dress his sword and shield was just way too heavy to carry David said get these things off of me Saul knew right then that his that his Theology and his opinions didn't fit a true child of God Amen David said I trust this little old slingshot and I'm going to keep right with it I tell you it was the Holy Ghost that saved me I don't care what's taking what takes place that God has chosen me amen let me say this it's the baptism of the Holy Ghost that's brought me this far it's the Bap baptism of the Holy Ghost that's going to take me home amen Amen brother brandham says brother the other day said he had a dream he seen a little old bitty devil stand standing over there and the and the little Dev was devil was just jumping up and down and and he said boo and he jumped back and every time he he jumped back he'd get a little he'd get little and the devil would get bigger every time he'd say the devil would say boo and he would back up and he would get small the devil would get bigger and devil would say boo and and he would back down he just kept getting smaller and smaller and brother brownon says every time he holled boo he'd jump back and the devil would get bigger he knew he had to fight him and then in this brother's dream he knew he had to fight him he was just getting too small he was getting too weak but he knew he had to fight back so he thought I've got to find a chair I've got to find something I got to find something to beat the devil with so what did he do he looked around and he found his Bible he picked up the word of God and he looked at s the eye and he said boo back and that devil got smaller you said boo back and that devil got smaller church you've got to take the word of God and you got to say boo devil yes sir you got to say boo devil Hallelujah to God it ain't going to work with your own ideas it ain't going to work with uh what this brother said or what T Jake says you take the messenger of the hour you take the word and you defeat Satan with it acts 18 says you shall receive power after the Holy Ghost has come upon you heyen it was good enough for me back there it's good enough for me now if it's good enough for you back there it's good enough for you now it'll be good for you when you're dying it'll be good for you when you're going through your trials it'll be good for you in your lowest times it will keep you when you're feeling alone it will keep you when you're all down and and distraught and you don't know which way is up and which way is sideways and and you just seem like you're getting nowhere with God but the message will keep you this word the anointing will keep you amen when your back is against the wall and you don't know what to do it's the Lord that will keep you it's the Holy Ghost on Fire and it's keeping me alive amen take the word and boo that devil devil till you knock him down amen he has anointed us for it he's anointed you for it amen here we are David said sure I know how to trust this slingshot so he goes out there and he gets in and gets ready to go fight now imagine Saul saying I've trained men for years how to carry a sword how to carry a shield and how to fight I've trained them in my greatest seminars or my Bible colleges I've trained them the best I know how now that fell has refused I wonder what he's going to do I wonder what this kid is going to do I've offered him my armor I've offered him my own ideas I offered him this book and I've offered him that book and I've offered him these ideas and that ideas but he won't take them what is he going to do I tell you what he did amen the greatest seminars or Bible College I wonder what he's going to do so now David out there looking along picking up five some Stones David out there picking up some rocks would you imagine a country boy right picking up some rocks pulled out his little old slingshot and unwounded it like that he said well wonder what he's going to do with this and when David went to meet Goliath Goliath looked at him and laughed and he said why am I a dog you coming out here to meet me like that a little old Ruddy looking boy little old fellow probably shoulders stooped over and here he comes with this little sling but he know that God when that's the main thing and he was a believer he was elected he was called he was anointed and he was placed amen and you say well I wasn't called to be a preacher but you might be called to be a contractor you might be called to be this you might be called to be that come on now you might be called to be a housewife but as long as he's got you positioned in Christ Jesus by the Holy Ghost and has anointed you you're just much as a David as the rest of them you don't have to be some big famous preacher you don't have to be some well-known person over here or some well-known person over there but as long as you're positionally placed in Christ you're a David as the rest of them amen so the battle's on the Philistines are standing there Goliath made his charge and here goes David he reaches down he looks out there and he looked at Goliath up and down like that but Beyond Goliath he saw the victory because he trusted in God he thought how much more dangerous that line is than this Goliath that's a wild beast I trusted God to direct this shot of mine right straight to the head of that beast and I trust God to direct to direct the shot here for I killed the lion to save one sheep that's right God let me save the Sheep because I had faith that he would save the Sheep he know where he was and every David sitting here tonight you're positionally and placed in Christ God has confirmed it he's uh his election calling anointing placing he elected you and called you then he anointed you with the Holy Ghost and now he's placed you with the body of Christ one of these Davids amen where's the Goliath who's the Goliath brother Daniel who's the Goliath that cancer that's eating you up that's right come on that tumor that's hanging around on you that depression Spirit that's hanging around on you that pack pain that joint pain arthritis that's a giant them toothaches that's a giant the headaches the fevers that's right those are all Giants everything looks at it and says but it can't be done the pain says it can't be done the weariness says it can't be done the doctor says it can't be done the devil says you might as well just quit believing you might as well just settle down because you can't never get with well your doctor said so and all the rest of them said so you can't get well but the Christ that got you through that lion and that bear the god that let you defeat one spirit that one oh my that got you through this trial that healed you of this disease and that disease God will get you through whatever giant you're facing tonight I'm a witness of that amen he didn't bring you through one trial to let you die in another amen he didn't bring you through this to let you despair in another amen praise God brother Brenham says Goliath are bragging Goliath says you see you was here last night and didn't get healed you was here at other meetings and didn't get healed who is that uncircumcised devil who is that devil that has no relationship with God at all who is that devil stands in nothing but a defeated thing behind him his master Was Defeated
