uh so um but we are a blessed people tonight amen many people uh woke up this morning with hangovers many people uh woke up this morning to find that they lost everything and many people breathe their last breath last night amen but God who was rich in Mercy woke us up this morning in our right Minds amen he woke us up with a with a heart to serve him amen are you thankful for that tonight amen if we could just turn to our Bibles tonight I I would like to turn to Psalms 1118 amen Psalms 118 it's a little lengthy and we're going to start with verse one amen if you're there say Amen Psalms 118 verse1 it says oh give thanks unto the Lord for he is good because his mercy endureth forever let Israel now say that his mercy endureth forever let the house of Aaron now say that his mercy endureth forever let them now that fear the lord say that his mercy endureth forever I called upon the Lord in distress the Lord answered me and set me in a large place the Lord is on my side I will not fear what can man do unto me the lord taketh my part uh with them that help me therefore shall I see my desire upon them that hate me it is better to trust in the Lord than to put confidence in man it is better to trust in the Lord than to put confidence in princes All Nations compassed me about but in the name of the Lord will I destroy them they compassed me about yay they compassed me about but in the name of the Lord I will destroy them they compassed me about like bees they are quenched as the fire of thorns for in the name of the Lord I will destroy them they they thou Hast thrust sore at me that I might fall but the Lord help me the Lord is my strength and song and has become my salvation if we could go down to the 28th verse Thou Art my God and I will praise thee Thou Art my God I will exalt thee oh give thanks unto the Lord for he is good for his mercy endureth forever amen can we also turn to uh Psalms 20 amen his mercy endureth forever amen Psalms 20 Psalms 20:7 says some trust in chariots and some in horses but we will remember the name of the Lord Our God they are brought down and Fallen we are risen and stand upright but we will remember the name of the Lord Our God Amen as we ask the Lord to bless the reading of the word you can be seated amen if I were to have a title tonight I I would would like to maybe title it we will remember the name of the Lord I this not really a New Year's message but I uh it was on my heart and I pray that it can be a blessing to you tonight um I want to take a minute and and lay a foundation so you would have to bear with me for just a few moments and hopefully it'll make sense in the End Amen but brother brandham says here he says now we are a part of God you always was you don't remember it because you were only an attribute in God you were only in his thinking your very name if it was ever on the book of life it was put there before the foundation of the world he knew what you were I'm not saying this to mix up Doctrine but to straighten it out that we might get away from this fear and scare you don't know who you are you you are not going to be but you are now the sons of God see you always were the sons of God see for when God had you in his thinking at the beginning you have to be some part of you your life that's in you now had to be with God before there well when he uh when he before he even became material here on Earth before there was anything but a God but God you were one of his attributes he knowed your name would be he know what your name would be he know the color of hair you would have he knowed All About You amen because you were in his mind before the foundation of the world Amen and brother brandham says if you have eternal life in you tonight then you always were a part of God even before the foundation of the world you were a part of God oh my that just that just gets me excited to know that I was in God's thinking way before there was even a molecule before there was even a star in the sky I was in God's mine oh my we were born Sinners and and there's nothing good about us we was born trash we acted like the Sinners we talked like the Sinners and but underneath all that muck underneath all the all the mire and the clay and the mud underneath all of that junk there was a seed of God laying in there amen and then one day something had to take place Amen in order for that seed of God to be quickened a change had to take place amen we had to have an experience with God Amen like they did on Pentecost not a Pentecostal experience not not a denominational experience but a true Pentecostal experience oh my Paul says in Ephesians verse 2 he says but God who is rich in Mercy for his great love wherewith he loved us even when we were dead in sins hath quickened us together with Christ by Grace you are saved and hath raised us up together and made us sit together in Heavenly places with Christ Jesus am amen yes we all know the story of the of the uh Eagle in the barnyard but if we would just take him for a minute and you know he tried to walk like the chicken and he tried to talk like the chicken and clu and he tried to eat the chicken food but deep down inside that little that little eagal he knew there was something different about himself he knew he couldn't cluck right he knew he couldn't that food just didn't taste just right and he knew there was something different and and he inside him was in him to soar the blue skies and and to feel the wind beneath his wings then one day as they were in the yard pecking around and and clucking and doing what chickens do and maybe a little Eagle maybe the little Eagle not knowing how to pet this right maybe he didn't know quite understand what they were talking about and he didn't understand the clucking noises and and the chickens maybe began to make fun of him and found that he was a disappointment and that he was up to no good and and and that he was a mistake and yet there was something pulsating in his heart that something was different oh my and then one day as as they were out there in the yard one day he maybe he was meditating maybe he was just sitting there just Lord why why did you put me here Lord I don't understand I can't talk like them I I can't act like them and and I've tried it before and then one day he heard an eagle scream oh my one day he heard mommy eagle and that changed his life forever oh my oh my one day he heard that scream and it said come up a little higher come higher than the fence post come higher than the barn come higher than the Treetops oh my come out of her amen there was something in his heart that lined up with the words of what mama was screaming oh my and he began to stretch his wings amen he went from the fence post to the barn he went from the barn to the Treetops he went from the Treetops to store the sky oh my and just like that eagle just like that little Eagle we have heard a scream amen we have heard the scream of the message for our day and that scream that that eagle screamed and and there was something pulsating in our heart that are that we lined up with what the word was saying oh my it's called us to come up higher it's called us to come up higher than our Trials come up higher than than your disappointments fly higher than your than than your fears fly higher than your present circumstance oh my it's time to fly higher than your denominational ideas fly higher than your own ideas amen don't just go don't don't just come up to the fence post and be satisfied there don't just go to the Treetops and be satisfied there but you are born to SAR the sky oh my come on now that's right amen he's called us to fly to sit in Heavenly places with Christ Jesus amen now there was nothing in that little Eagle that ever wanted to return to that barnyard oh my once he had experienced what it was like to be free once he exper experienced the goodness of God he couldn't go back to what he was amen now we all know what it's like to experience something man we experience things every day amen and you know when forgive me if this is the wrong illustration but when you go to a restaurant and you you know you will walk out knowing whether or not you will go back again amen it depends on your experience amen you walk in and you like the food well guess what you're going back amen and if you didn't like the food well you hope they Clos down you know it depends on your experience with the place amen depends on how how how everyone acted how you was served and and how your drink was placed in front of you amen you know all you depends on your experience amen you know uh me and my wife we we love to go to that Mexican restaurant El Bronco there in Christiansburg I'm telling you you try their street tacos one time you're going to keep going back amen the experience it's just it's just out of this world Amen and and but there was something there that just kept calling us to come back and and and to come back and and forgive me but David says in Psalms 34 and8 says oh taste and see that the Lord is good blessed is the man that trusteth in him amen now now when David was a Shepherd boy brother Bram says David when he used to carry a little pouch on a little scrip bag on his side and he used to carry a little stuff in it and but he carried h in that bag amen and when when one of the sheep would get sick he would go out and put some of this honey on some lime Limestone rock that the Sheep would come up and they would go to licking the honey and when they did they lick the Limestone with it and the Limestone healed the sick Sheep amen and David is saying oh taste and see that the Lord is good amen come experience what I've experienced come experience the mercies of the Lord Lord amen and let me say this tonight we have a b full of Honey amen and we're going to place it on the Rock of Ages Jesus Christ and you all are welcome just to come and experience Oh my he will give you glory for your misery he will give you happiness for your Gloom he will give you health for your sickness he will give you the Holy Ghost for your theology oh my come and taste and see that the Lord is good amen for his mercies endureth forever amen that little little Eagle couldn't go back to pecking on the ground he couldn't go back to clucking like a chicken because once he experienced Mama's scream once he experienced the wind beneath his wings he knew who he was Oh my he knew that he was an eagle born for the sky born to be free and that's the same for each one of us tonight that's the same for every believer you weren't born eat chicken food you weren't born to cck like a chicken you were born to be free we were born to sit in Heavenly places with Christ Jesus amen we were we were born to dwell in the presence of God Amen night and day we was born to be in his presence amen taste and see that the Lord is good amen these words aren't from a theologian these words isn't from a Baptist idea these words isn't from my idea amen these words didn't come from a Pentecostal idea but it's life to the believer come and see come and taste the the mercies of the Lord amen amen that's right yes the world thinks they've tried it the world thinks they've tasted the mercies of the Lord they think they've had everything that that that the word says amen amen they think they've tried it and it's only gotten the people to a god of yesterday that's it oh my it's only gotten the people to a man's idea to a man's Creed oh my yeah they have a form of godliness oh yeah they dress like they dress like you and I sometimes and and they try to live a life according to the Bible or from what they understand amen but they are denying the power thereof amen but when a Believer begin to Feast off the unadulterated word for this hour oh my amen the red light is on Amen you got to believe for every promise of God Amen it won't matter what the doctor says then it won't matter what the Pope says then it won't matter what your friend says then you've tasted and you found that the Lord he is good and his mercies endureth forever oh my Psalms 103 says bless the Lord oh my soul and all that is within me bless His holy name bless the Lord oh my soul and forget not all of his benefits don't forget all of his benefits oh my who redeemeth thy life from Dru destruction who crowneth thee with loving kindness and Tender Mercies who satisfy thy mouth with good things so that thy youth is renewed like the eagles oh my forget not all of his benefits amen now when you experience something a lot of times it's hard to forget those things amen when you have a good experience a lot of times it's hard to forget those good experience amen let's just say you were to go on a hunting trip with a guide for a few days and and they offered a maybe a a package to go with this with this hunting trip this a a package that would be called a a benefits that comes with this p uh package and maybe they would give you lodging maybe they would cook your your meals three times a day and and with his package with his benefits they give you gear and and he and the guide himself knows exactly where those deer are amen and then you harvest the biggest buck of your life amen and it would be really hard to forget that experience amen you go out there with that guy and and he gives you lodging for with the meal I mean he does the whole nine yards for you and then you get your biggest buck on top of that oh my that's that that's that's benefits right there that's an experience you won't forget amen you would want to tell everybody how awesome it was amen you would then tell everyone about your guide and how amazing he was and and how you put him to the test and and he come try and you tried him and he came through for you amen that would be that would be awesome that would be an amazing experience and you would recommend him to anyone that was looking for a guide service amen can I get an amen amen and and here David is saying forget not all the Lord's benefits amen don't just because you get the Holy Ghost don't mean that God can't heal you amen when you get the Holy Ghost don't mean that God doesn't just leave you there and forget about you and now you got to do your own thing I've given you that my life and now now that's it no no no no no when you get the Holy Ghost when you accept Christ as your your savior it comes with all kinds of benefits amen taste and see that the Lord is good amen oh my a lot of times if we're not careful when troubles come our way we forget What the Lord Has Done For Us oh my a lot of times when when bad things happen to us we want to blame God for for for for those things and we want to ask him why when we can say Lord Lord thy will be D and and Lord yeah I know things are happening in my life and but Lord I remember what you did for me and Lord I know you're going to bring me through oh my sometimes we forget we forget his benefits amen the doctor May say well you're ate up with cancer and you don't have long to live but look at the benefits of God oh my I'm the god that Health all your diseases oh my you may not even have the money for groceries you may not have the money to pay your rent or or or put gas in your car but he says I am the god that provides all your needs oh my well you say I'm fighting battles and I don't know if I can win well look at the promises of God Amen he said in the Bible for the Lord your God it is he that goeth with you to fight you fight for you against your enemies to save you you shall not fear them for the Lord your God he shall fight for you amen trust in the Lord and forget not all of his benefits amen if we look at David and Goliath amen we all know the story very well amen but one time Israel was called out to war against the Philistines and the Philistines had gathered uh over on one side of the mountain and the Israelites on the other side and there was a valley laying in between them and Goliath and brother oh how we like to brag I'll I'll make you a proposition choose you one man and come over here and fight me and if I whip him then you all will serve us and if we whip him or if he whips me we'll serve you and that's how Satan is boasting that's that's what the devil does oh my that giant made his made his brag that at the wrong time amen little old David man he he looked over and he says do you mean to tell me that that that you'll let that uncircumcised Philistine stand up there and defy the armies of the Living God Amen Saul was the biggest man of them all he was best trained he he he had more uh he was more equipped uh he was more equipped man to fight Goliath amen but he was a coward amen and brother Brenham says he was a coward and that means it doesn't that means it doesn't lay in your training amen it doesn't lay in your training it lays in your experience with God it lays in the experience with God and David was brought up before Saul and Saul said why that man is a military man and he's been a Warrior from his Youth and you're nothing but a youth but he was talking to a man that had experience oh my oh my and that's the way Satan does he'll point out your weakness he'll try to get you to doubt but you have to remind him of your experience amenl he said sir when I was taking care of my daddy's sheep out behind the mountains one day there was a lion com in and he grabbed one of my sheep and and he run off with him I took my slingshot and I knocked him down and I went after my lamb and when I picked up picked the lamb out of his mouth he rose up against me and I slew him and he said a bear came in and got one and I knocked him down and he said and the god that delivered me out of the Paw of the lion and out of the mouth of the bear how much more will he deliver me out of this uncircumcised uncircumcised Philistine amen David didn't know any theology but he knew God he knew who God was he had an experience right amen he was talking to a man that was full of uh that was full of fighting theology but he had never put God to the test Saul was full with ideas and Saul was full with teachings but Saul had never put God to the test oh my and that's the way it is today it doesn't take education it doesn't take a lot of thinking it takes a humble heart who has been dedicated to the power of the resurrection of Christ and filled with the Holy Ghost that knows what they talking about amen it takes faith and an experience in the resurrected Jesus Christ Lord oh amen and I believe I believe I'm talking to Believers tonight I believe I'm talking to believers who can stand and say but I've testified I'm a witness of the mercies of the Lord I've experienced his goodness I've tried him I've tested him and I've never seen the righteous for Aken nor is she to begging for bread amen oh my experience amen the world is growing darker and darker amen we know this is Satan's Eden we know that we're living in Satan's Eden and but one day we know it's got to come to an end amen and the world knows that something is getting ready to take place amen they're preparing for World War II and and they're getting everything ready for Destruction and and there's just such a great oppression over over this Earth amen and the people are crying out to the president to save them amen they're crying out to entertainment to numb their minds to forget it all they're crying out to some Superman to save them but David said in my distress I called on the Lord and he heard me oh my in a world that's dark and full of Filth there are believers here tonight who remembers the name of the Lord oh my remember the name of the Lord some trust in chariots and some in horses but we will remember the name of the Lord our Goden oh my Proverbs 18 And1 the name of the Lord is a strong tower and the righteous run into it and is safe amen the name of the Lord is a strong tower oh man don't fear tomorrow Don't Fear the Future don't fear what 2025 has to bring just remember the name of the Lord for the name of the Lord is a strong tower amen and the righteous can run into it and is safe that's right amen when Shadrach mhach and abedo was thrown into the fiery furnace amen they didn't cry and give up in despair they didn't call for an army to come and save them but but what they did have was an experience with God and they remembered the name of the Lord and they said our God is more than able to deliver us out of this furnace amen and no matter how hard the battle gets no matter how hot the Fire gets no matter how hard life gets this New Year we will remember the name of the Lord amen this could be our last year this could be the final age or the final the final year amen but we've got to remember the name of the Lord amen they remember the name of the Lord forget not all of his benefits oh my amen the signs of the time they're everywhere amen this isn't time to live in fear this isn't the time to live in despair Luke 21 says and when these things begin to come to pass then look up and lift your heads for your Redemption draweth nigh amen God has a bride preserved for his name's sake amen death can't touch her despair can't touch her oppression can't touch her Fire Can't harm her Waters can destroy her amen God has a bride reserved for his name's sake 2 Corinthians 4 four says we are troubled on every side yet not distressed we are perplexed but not in despair persecuted but not forsaken we are cast down but we're not

tasted amen the power of his healing and we tasted his delivering power we tasted amen that that when when we go through things that God is present amen and we know what we're saying we know what we're singing about what we're preaching about because it's it's something that we've tasted we' tasted uh that Jesus as Christ is the same yesterday today and forever and uh I'm I'm so glad for that if uh you know it's God dwells in his word and the word came to us in this age amen and this why you know we believe that the message is Christ it's it's not just something we learning in church but it's something we're experiencing and that when we're taking him taking that word into our heart and we're believing it he is is he's coming on the scene for us and he's showing himself real and I'm I'm just so glad for that amen that we're not learning about a god of yesterday not just of a God that worked in brother branham's Ministry when he was here and but we're we're seeing that same God moving through his word and as we're eating the word as we're fellowshipping around that word amen Christ is becoming more known to us and I'm so glad for that I I think that's what the message is about it it brings us into a personal relationship with Jesus Christ that that we know him we really know him not not knowing him by our imagination of him of what we think he is not just fellowship with some spirit that we call God but we're we're actually seeing the Christ of this Bible made known to us and I'm I'm so glad for that and I think uh it just a wonderful message tonight and that we should take courage [Music] amen take courage church amen as we heard that we don't know the what the New Year holds but I truly believe that this could be the last year that we live as Mortals on this Earth amen I truly believe that I and you know um thinking that you know the world celebrating the new year and then wake up and hearing about the tragedy that happened in uh Louisiana and uh just uh fear gripping the people and um the thing that happened in in uh Las Vegas today and just just a lot of things going on church and so no matter how much the people are celebrating trying to bring in a a millennium or trying to bring in a golden age it ain't going to work the Lord is our refuge amen and something that we can face the future with great hope great faith great encouragement and I'm so glad for that do you love the Lord amen and um I uh I thought of you know brother brandom talking about if you and and I'm sure maybe all of us have you know uh where they have that you know a picture and but you have to stare at that picture uh uh to really when you're just looking at it just seems like a conglomeration of stuff but you have to just stare at it and Zone in on it and when you Zone hone in on it you can actually see things in in that picture and um it's funny then you take your eyes away and you look at it again and you that's all you can see because you finally caught the object of what that picture was saying and uh brother brandom he had talked about that and you know he said that's that's the way Christ is himself the gospel sees said that's the message is when you once see the message of the hour there's nothing else that you can see but that that's all everything else is gone the rest of it is just fer when you see the message can you sayen and I'm so glad we see the message and not just a man bringing a message I'm so glad we see Christ in this message and that's all we can see amen I love the Lord and uh before we you know go um maybe we could just stand to our feet and um this may may seem a little odd and uh tonight but I'd like to do it uh and that is maybe we could all uh join hands uh together and let's just pray um you know for one another and um maybe we could just stop the music and maybe we could just just come over here and just join hands with one another and I um I I believe it's a an important hour church and we certainly need the Lord and uh we've got uh you know uh different ones that are facing battles in in sickness and their uh finances and just struggles and you know uh God is our help church and uh so we just want to pray just believe God ask people know that ofar dri de away Church Father min you know we we've left the year and and over and over amen we've uh uh brother brandham would teach us that you know leave the past behind leave the mistakes of of last year behind leave all of that behind and press forward to a a a a a a greater year and the promises of God and I'm I'm just so glad for that that we can do that that his Mercy is new every morning can you say amen amen and I wanted just say Happy New Year to all of you and uh uh just believe in great things uh this year that God has for us and and uh I think we all should look forward to that I'm just looking for prayers to be answered I'm looking for loved ones uh uh to come in and to be saved and I think that's the way we ought to look at the New Year face this new year is just believing for miracles amen and uh I'm I'm just believing that and and um I just uh we want to continue praying for sister Martha and as she would go to uh get tests tomorrow done and and just keep her in your prayer church and uh brother Virgil and not doing good and uh so we want to keep him in our prayer and sister Shirley y has not given much time to live and um and so I know uh she would uh just appreciate the prayers and we just believe God to to work a miracle on on her behalf as well and uh just want to say it's good to have brother Josiah and sister Mindy and the children back amen and God kept their vehicle safe and uh back on the road amen home brother Terry amen good to have brother Terry back and missed him brother Amos Sister Lisa and we want to keep sister Alice in our prayer as well that God will just touch her amen and uh we we know he certainly will amen just we're Believers aren't we the Lord is so good amen and uh uh he he certainly uh looks to uh show himself strong on the behalf of his children amen and um just to say this before we close um it looks like um uh I'm going to be going to Africa if everything works right uh wed next Wednesday and got a call last night and asking if um we would go and U and so um it it looks like that may be happening and so if so we really covet your prayer and uh uh get nervous you know like home and uh but certainly don't want to go if I can't help the people but uh just been praying about it and and so uh uh really covet your prayers as well it's not the Lord's will that he would block it and um uh you know but if he does if it is his will just really want his anointing and his help amen so uh remember that and uh brother Daniel and sister Britney will be leaving as well Saturday uh to go to Oklahoma and um they wanted to uh Daniel wanted to spend some time with Dad there and and um you know you know we just praying for Dad but um uh you know we just uh anyway
