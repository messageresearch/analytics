[58:59] we uh sister Rebecca Adams man we're
[59:04] just going to hate to see you guys go
[59:06] and I know Ann is for sure and brother
[59:10] Michaela and sister Shekinah and I tell
[59:14] you
[59:16] we've just been truly blessed I for one
[59:19] I feel blessed to be part of a family
[59:22] that to see my nephews and nieces and
[59:27] just give theirselves to the Lord and
[59:31] give their talents to the Lord and I
[59:34] know it hasn't been easy for all you
[59:36] young people especially in this day that
[59:38] we're living in
[59:40] and a lot of temptations that are out
[59:42] there and but I say God bless you
[59:46] very much and may you just keep pressing
[59:49] the battle
[59:50] because you're part of this you're part
[59:53] of this and everything that God is doing
[59:55] in this age God has has set you in where
[59:59] you're at and uh for such a time as this
[1:00:03] and you just keep looking toward the
[1:00:08] prize because the Rapture the Rapture is
[1:00:10] for you as well and and this is why the
[1:00:14] Devil he's no respecter of persons he's
[1:00:16] going to attack in any way can but the
[1:00:19] Lord is no respecter of age either he's
[1:00:21] no respecter of persons and has called
[1:00:24] you just as much as he's called me for
[1:00:27] this age and so you just keep pressing
[1:00:31] on
[1:00:32] and
[1:00:33] all the home folks that have been gone
[1:00:36] it's good to have you here this morning
[1:00:39] and brother AJ and sister Kimberly
[1:00:43] we certainly love them appreciate them
[1:00:46] and good to have you all
[1:00:47] and as most of you might know I know
[1:00:50] some of you do especially you young
[1:00:52] people but brother shalom
[1:00:54] has has moved to North Carolina
[1:00:58] to be with his extended family I guess
[1:01:01] we could say that for a while and
[1:01:04] so it certainly breaks our heart to see
[1:01:08] him go
[1:01:09] uh there but he he just feels that the
[1:01:12] Lord is leading down that way we'll say
[1:01:16] for a while anyways but you know God
[1:01:20] sends people in our lives to be a
[1:01:22] positive impact
[1:01:24] and and brother shalom has been a
[1:01:27] positive impact to me and
[1:01:29] to to many of us here
[1:01:32] and so we we miss them people that are
[1:01:36] no longer with us or there you know but
[1:01:40] we certainly pray that the Lord will
[1:01:42] bless him
[1:01:43] and keep him wherever he goes and I tell
[1:01:48] you more than anything The Lord Is Our
[1:01:50] Shepherd
[1:01:51] and he knows he knows how to take care
[1:01:53] of us he knows how to delete us and to
[1:01:57] bring us where we need to be and so we
[1:02:01] certainly commit him into the hands of
[1:02:04] Our Lord amen
[1:02:06] and I want to say happy anniversary to
[1:02:09] my beloved wife
[1:02:11] uh 12 years now and so
[1:02:15] uh
[1:02:18] and uh I certainly appreciate her and
[1:02:22] she's sure been a an inspiration of
[1:02:25] strength to me in my life and I love her
[1:02:29] to Pieces so under death or whatever you
[1:02:31] want to call it but I certainly love her
[1:02:34] and appreciate her and uh but before we
[1:02:40] go into the word may we just bow our
[1:02:43] heads and
[1:02:44] talk to our lord for we realize without
[1:02:47] him we're nothing
[1:02:49] and we need him more today than we ever
[1:02:52] have
[1:02:53] so let's just pray to him father
[1:02:57] with humbled hearts Lord
[1:03:00] and knowing that we're your children
[1:03:03] Lord knowing that you've bid us to come
[1:03:06] today Lord together Lord to be with you
[1:03:10] to meet with you
[1:03:12] and father I

[1:03:17] words that have been said thus far have
[1:03:20] been pleasing to you father I know it

[1:03:26] back to us the Lord
[1:03:29] father that you would anoint me Lord and
[1:03:31] that you'd help me just get myself out
[1:03:34] of the way and anoint the gift that you
[1:03:37] placed within my life and
[1:03:39] Lord that you would take my mouth and
[1:03:42] that you would speak and you take the
[1:03:44] words that are said Lord and that you
[1:03:47] would just
[1:03:48] planted every heart this morning no
[1:03:51] matter how simple the subject may be
[1:03:53] and they're knowing the hearts and ears
[1:03:56] of your people Lord to to understand and
[1:03:59] to receive father
[1:04:01] Lord we ask these things and we just
[1:04:03] Commit This service now unto your hands
[1:04:06] in Jesus Christ's name
[1:04:08] amen
[1:04:10] the book of Isaiah the sixth chapter
[1:04:16] and
[1:04:21] we're going to start at the first verse
[1:04:24] but it says in the year that King Uzziah
[1:04:27] died I saw also the Lord sitting up on a
[1:04:29] throne
[1:04:30] high and lifted up and his train filled
[1:04:33] the temple
[1:04:34] above it stood the seraphims each one
[1:04:38] had six wings with Twain he covered his
[1:04:41] face
[1:04:42] and with Twain
[1:04:44] he did or end with Twain he covered his
[1:04:47] feet
[1:04:48] and with Twain he did fly
[1:04:51] and one Cried unto another and said holy
[1:04:54] holy holy is the Lord of hosts the whole
[1:04:56] earth is full of his glory
[1:05:00] and the post of the door moved at the
[1:05:03] voice of him that cried and the house
[1:05:05] was filled with smoke
[1:05:07] then said I woe was me for I am undone
[1:05:10] because I am a man of unclean lips and I
[1:05:13] dwell in the midst of a people of
[1:05:15] unclean lips for mine eyes have seen the
[1:05:18] king
[1:05:19] the Lord of hosts
[1:05:21] then flew one of the seraphims unto me
[1:05:23] having a life coal in his hand
[1:05:26] which he had taken with the tongs from
[1:05:29] off the Altar and he laid it upon my
[1:05:31] mouth and said Lo this has touched thy
[1:05:33] lips
[1:05:34] and thine iniquity is taken away and thy
[1:05:37] sin is purged also I heard the voice of
[1:05:41] the Lord saying whom shall I send and
[1:05:43] who will go for us then said I here am I
[1:05:48] send me
[1:05:49] amen you can have your seats this
[1:05:52] morning
[1:05:53] and
[1:05:57] I'm going to continue on the the thought
[1:06:00] that we have been speaking on and that
[1:06:03] is Ministry
[1:06:05] and
[1:06:07] um we've been on this subject for for a
[1:06:09] little bit and so uh but we we know that
[1:06:13] we're not just talking about any
[1:06:14] Ministry we're
[1:06:15] we're talking about the ministry
[1:06:18] of God God's Ministry
[1:06:22] and
[1:06:24] for those who are visiting Ministry
[1:06:27] it means it's an agent or an instrument
[1:06:32] a person or thing through which
[1:06:34] something is accomplished
[1:06:36] so the purpose of ministry is is to
[1:06:40] accomplish
[1:06:41] uh it's it's for accomplishing and and
[1:06:44] the word accomplished means to bring to
[1:06:46] completion to fulfill
[1:06:49] so that's that's what the ministry of
[1:06:51] God is for is to accomplish to to bring
[1:06:55] to completion to fulfill uh a purpose
[1:07:00] and so
[1:07:01] um we we understand then why so many
[1:07:05] will come up short and be left behind
[1:07:08] because not just any ministry will
[1:07:12] accomplish what God is after and so the
[1:07:16] ministry of God is an agent or agency by
[1:07:21] which something again is is accomplished
[1:07:24] and so this means that through the
[1:07:26] operation of the ministry power is
[1:07:30] exerted so the end is achieved amen uh
[1:07:35] through the the operation of the
[1:07:37] ministry
[1:07:39] so then we look of what purpose what
[1:07:42] what is to be accomplished in uh
[1:07:45] Jeremiah 29 11 says for God says for I
[1:07:48] know the thoughts that I think towards
[1:07:51] you saith the Lord thoughts of peace and
[1:07:53] not of evil to give you an expected in
[1:07:57] and and so this is why God would put his
[1:08:01] ministry is the direction of God's
[1:08:05] Ministry is that there is an expected
[1:08:07] end and it's not my expected end that I
[1:08:10] have that I'm trying to accomplish it's
[1:08:12] not yours it's it's God's ain't that
[1:08:15] right God's purpose and and so uh uh
[1:08:20] Ministry has a purpose behind it amen
[1:08:24] we're not none of us are wasting our
[1:08:26] time if you're part of the ministry
[1:08:28] whether you're singing whether you're
[1:08:30] preaching whether you're holding an
[1:08:32] office or whether you're testifying or
[1:08:34] whether your mother father whatever it
[1:08:38] is there is a purpose if you're part of
[1:08:41] God's Ministry amen so so we're not
[1:08:44] floating around and uh but so so then
[1:08:48] every Branch every branch of God's
[1:08:52] Ministry exists to serve his purpose
[1:08:55] we've talked about the ministry of
[1:08:57] Angels the ministry of the Holy Spirit
[1:08:59] the the the then there's the ministry of
[1:09:02] the prophets
[1:09:03] um uh uh that the Bible talks about the
[1:09:06] ministry of the Evangelist the
[1:09:08] missionary or Apostle uh Pastor uh uh uh
[1:09:12] uh teacher uh Prophet all these faithful
[1:09:16] Ministry and then the Bible speaks of
[1:09:19] the ministry of the Saints and within
[1:09:21] that Ministry uh there are singers
[1:09:24] musicians prophecy tongues
[1:09:27] interpretation of tongues Gifts of
[1:09:29] healings uh uh uh even down to the the
[1:09:33] janitor uh father and mother that that's
[1:09:37] a Ministry to be honest
[1:09:39] um uh their brother Branham even talked
[1:09:41] about mother being the Fifth Gospel uh
[1:09:44] uh there but uh there's Visions dreams
[1:09:47] and and and so many things and then the
[1:09:50] Apostle Paul talks about helps and
[1:09:52] governments and and uh but it's all for
[1:09:55] the ministry uh uh there and so all the
[1:09:59] these Ministries with or branches within
[1:10:03] his the ministry of God uh he has that
[1:10:07] so that his eternal purpose can be
[1:10:11] accomplished and and see as as we've
[1:10:14] been talking but just to go back over it
[1:10:17] God has wrote uh uh names in the Lamb's
[1:10:21] Book of Life before the foundation of
[1:10:23] the world and those names were in his
[1:10:27] thinking uh uh at the beginning the
[1:10:30] prophet said they are the Eternal
[1:10:32] thoughts of God and they are what makes
[1:10:35] up the bride of Christ and we fail from
[1:10:39] God's thoughts and so therefore we all
[1:10:43] have an adamic nature uh which is a
[1:10:47] fallen nature and and as we know that in
[1:10:51] in our first birth we come as sons of
[1:10:55] Adam uh rather than sons of God and and
[1:11:00] we we are sinners we we were uh uh we
[1:11:04] were enemies uh By Nature uh against God
[1:11:09] um uh you know we were slaves to our
[1:11:12] enemy we were just miserable wretch uh
[1:11:15] liars and and and such and so what but
[1:11:19] what we were in our first birth we did
[1:11:22] not reflect the thoughts of God uh it
[1:11:25] wasn't the Eternal thoughts of god of
[1:11:28] what God thought us to be and now we
[1:11:31] thought this was life we thought that we
[1:11:34] would forever be what we are and and and
[1:11:36] what's sad is is the devil tries his
[1:11:39] best to convince us that that that will
[1:11:42] still be whatever we are whether we're
[1:11:44] dealing with habits whether we're
[1:11:46] dealing with uh just issues in our
[1:11:48] personal life that that the devil will
[1:11:51] try to convince us that you'll always be
[1:11:53] that way so what's the use of trying but
[1:11:56] that's a lie that that's a lie and and
[1:11:59] so the ministry is not founded upon what
[1:12:03] you are as in your first birth the
[1:12:06] ministry is founded by God's purpose and
[1:12:09] upon what God thought you to be uh in
[1:12:12] the beginning ain't that right and so
[1:12:15] see God called us to be different than
[1:12:18] what we were or what we are according to
[1:12:21] our natural birth he's called us to be
[1:12:24] different his calling is higher than
[1:12:26] what we are his his intentions are
[1:12:29] greater than what we would ever think
[1:12:31] and and sometimes even in our carnal
[1:12:33] mind as you young people you you might
[1:12:35] think well I'm going to be this and I'm
[1:12:37] going to do this and I'm going to do
[1:12:38] that and a lot of times you think on
[1:12:40] them things and you make your plans
[1:12:42] based off of carnal understanding based
[1:12:45] off discouragement based off the devil
[1:12:47] telling you there ain't no use of trying
[1:12:49] to even try to be a Christian because of
[1:12:51] your failures and all that and you'll
[1:12:53] make plans based upon that and and and
[1:12:55] then God says I'm that that ain't going
[1:12:58] to be the plan that that my plan is
[1:13:00] greater than yours my you understand and
[1:13:02] this is where God says through Isaac the
[1:13:04] prophet Isaiah my thoughts are higher
[1:13:06] than your thoughts and and and so uh uh
[1:13:10] these things and so see God
[1:13:12] predestinated us to be different than
[1:13:14] what we are or what we were uh uh there
[1:13:18] and so uh uh anything that you are in
[1:13:22] your natural life your natural birth and
[1:13:24] your by your natural carnal thinking or
[1:13:27] whatever amen there's something God's
[1:13:30] predestination overrides that if if that
[1:13:33] would you understand and so so a lot of
[1:13:37] times even when a preacher is preaching
[1:13:39] it's just like the prophet amen he did
[1:13:41] not preach according to your present
[1:13:43] State he he preached from God's thoughts
[1:13:46] amen and he already called you Justified
[1:13:49] he already called it it's already done
[1:13:52] you understand what I'm saying and and
[1:13:54] so uh we we could not be what God called
[1:13:58] us to be me as long as Sin had dominion
[1:14:02] over us but see no matter what shape you
[1:14:05] were in or are present tense in amen
[1:14:10] because you know a lot of us look and
[1:14:12] say well I you know I'm not where I need
[1:14:15] to be when you hear the propheter you
[1:14:17] hear the Minister preach certain things
[1:14:19] and you're like man that's just not
[1:14:21] where I'm at I'm well that's fine that
[1:14:23] that's totally fine amen because God
[1:14:26] doesn't look at your present condition
[1:14:28] and no matter what you're you're in
[1:14:31] present tense you you you you're an
[1:14:34] eternal thought of God if you're part of
[1:14:37] God's plan and and and and and so he
[1:14:40] confirms that you are a part of his plan
[1:14:43] by giving you the baptism of the Holy
[1:14:45] Ghost ain't that right God doesn't waste
[1:14:48] his time giving people the holy ghost
[1:14:49] that ain't part of his plan but if
[1:14:52] you're part of his plan and he has
[1:14:53] filled you with the Holy Ghost that is
[1:14:55] your guarantee that no matter where
[1:14:57] you're at it puts you in an eternal
[1:14:59] arrest that I am an eternal thought of
[1:15:02] God now Satan get away from me ain't
[1:15:05] that right so the ministry is is the
[1:15:08] purpose of ministry is dealing with the
[1:15:10] thoughts of God and not your present
[1:15:13] condition and and sometimes God will
[1:15:16] rebuke God will correct God will shape
[1:15:18] you ain't that right but thank God for
[1:15:21] his correction thank God for him taking
[1:15:24] us and not allowing us to be there and
[1:15:26] it's not that God is preaching against
[1:15:28] you it's not that God is trying to
[1:15:30] correct in the sense of damn you he is
[1:15:33] trying to cut that devil away from you
[1:15:35] and when he when he when he deals with
[1:15:37] it he's dealing with that demon that is
[1:15:40] trying to pledge you and and and and and
[1:15:42] and and to try to cut you free from them
[1:15:45] things ain't that right amen well it's
[1:15:47] it's the truth a man because Satan wants
[1:15:50] to misguide you and the shepherd says
[1:15:52] absolutely not you ain't doing that to
[1:15:54] my son right and and so and then our
[1:15:57] hearts humble ourselves and we say say
[1:15:59] oh God take take me you know and and I
[1:16:02] thank God for his dealing with us but
[1:16:05] see within you is a gene seed of God and
[1:16:08] within that seed is everything that God
[1:16:11] thought you to be it's already in you
[1:16:13] ain't that right and so as we stated uh
[1:16:17] Wednesday night that is what's causing
[1:16:19] you to groan within and and uh you know
[1:16:23] I'll read it here Romans 8 18 Paul talks
[1:16:26] about that groaning he says I reckon
[1:16:28] that the sufferings of this present time
[1:16:30] are not worthy to be compared with the
[1:16:32] glory which shall be revealed in us for
[1:16:36] the earnest expectation of the creature
[1:16:38] Wade is for the manifestation of the
[1:16:40] sons of God for the creature was made
[1:16:43] subject to vanity not willingly but by
[1:16:46] reason of him who has subjected the same
[1:16:49] in Hope amen see so he has subjected you
[1:16:53] to this vanity of the world but he also
[1:16:55] subjected you to the hope of of his
[1:16:57] promises of what he thought want you to
[1:17:00] be because the creature itself shall
[1:17:03] shell everybody say shell also be
[1:17:06] delivered from the bondage of corruption
[1:17:08] into the Glorious Liberty of the
[1:17:10] children of God for we know that the
[1:17:13] whole creation growneth and travaileth
[1:17:16] in pain together into now it's either
[1:17:17] labor pains a man and not only they but
[1:17:21] also ourselves which have the first
[1:17:23] fruits of the spirit even we ourselves
[1:17:25] grown within ourselves waiting for the
[1:17:27] adoption to wit the Redemption or the
[1:17:30] changing of our body ain't that right so
[1:17:33] we're groaning and you may have had the
[1:17:35] Holy Ghost you may have you may have
[1:17:36] been in this for 50 years and and but
[1:17:39] you're still groaning we're groaning the
[1:17:41] groaning never stops until we come to
[1:17:44] the completion of what God thought us to
[1:17:46] be amen and that's there's a millennium
[1:17:48] waiting for us there's a Rapture waiting
[1:17:50] for us there's a new Heaven and Earth
[1:17:51] waiting for us and this is just a
[1:17:54] constant groaning a groaning amen you
[1:17:57] may not be what you used to be but
[1:17:58] there's still constant groaning a
[1:18:01] reaching Force ain't that right a
[1:18:03] Believer will never can never be settled
[1:18:06] in where they're at present tense God's
[1:18:09] always pushing us to go higher in him
[1:18:12] for you any or an eternal thought and
[1:18:14] God's plan is a Plan of Redemption ain't
[1:18:19] that right and in other words this Plan
[1:18:21] of Redemption is to bring you back bring
[1:18:25] all us back to what God originally
[1:18:28] thought us to be before the world began
[1:18:31] Romans 8 28 a popular scripture very
[1:18:34] well known but it's our scripture amen
[1:18:37] that we rest our soul upon for whom he
[1:18:40] did for no he also did predestinate to
[1:18:43] be conformed to the image of a son that
[1:18:46] he might be the firstborn among many
[1:18:48] Brethren moreover whom he did
[1:18:50] predestinate them he also called in whom
[1:18:53] he called then he also justified in whom
[1:18:56] he justified them he also glorified God
[1:18:59] so God foreknew them and wrote their
[1:19:03] names in the Lamb's Book of Life for
[1:19:06] they are the Eternal thoughts of God the
[1:19:08] Rapture is for them the changing of the
[1:19:10] body is for them Heaven is for them the
[1:19:13] marriage supper of the Lamb is for them
[1:19:15] the Millennium is for them the new city
[1:19:17] coming down from heaven is for them can
[1:19:21] you say Amen you realize that they will
[1:19:23] be the only ones living in that City
[1:19:26] amen that's what the prophet said now
[1:19:28] there's going to be other people living
[1:19:30] outside the city amen and and even
[1:19:33] Revelations talks about a 21 uh 23 and
[1:19:37] the city had no need of the sun neither
[1:19:39] of the moon to shine in it for the glory
[1:19:42] of God did lighten it and the lamb is
[1:19:45] the light thereof and the nations of
[1:19:48] them which are safe shall walk in the
[1:19:51] light of it and the kings of the earth
[1:19:53] do bring their Glory and Honor unto it
[1:19:56] and the gates of it shall not be shut At
[1:19:59] All by day for there shall not be no
[1:20:01] night there and they shall bring the
[1:20:04] glory and honor of the Nations into it
[1:20:07] ain't that right but they dwell on the
[1:20:09] outside of the city amen and they are
[1:20:12] given eternal life at the white Throne
[1:20:14] judgment and will populate the Earth
[1:20:17] outside the city ain't that right but
[1:20:19] the prophet said but they will not be
[1:20:21] the elected and called bride they are
[1:20:24] the ones that come up in the second
[1:20:26] Resurrection ain't that right the
[1:20:28] prophet said there will be dealers of
[1:20:30] the Soul like Adam was and so forth
[1:20:33] caretakers of the garden but the bride
[1:20:36] everybody say that's me see the bride as
[1:20:39] Queen will be live inside the kingdom
[1:20:43] with the King ain't that right so this
[1:20:47] message of redemption is for the bride
[1:20:50] because he's already got an eternal
[1:20:53] purpose for her amen and that is to live
[1:20:56] with him that is to reign with him in in
[1:20:59] that City a man for eternity ain't that
[1:21:03] right amen says so now how how God's
[1:21:07] already got a plan God already knows
[1:21:09] who's going to make up that bride ain't
[1:21:11] that right he's Justified he called her
[1:21:14] predestinated Justified and has already
[1:21:16] glorified amen and the position is
[1:21:20] already there amen and and as the
[1:21:23] prophet here in this life said and no
[1:21:25] one can take your place no one I don't
[1:21:28] care how insignificant you feel I don't
[1:21:30] care how unworthy you feel I don't care
[1:21:32] how many trials you go through and how
[1:21:34] dark it may be no one can take your
[1:21:37] place whether you're on the Mountaintop
[1:21:39] no one can take your place if you're in
[1:21:41] the valley no one can take your place if
[1:21:43] you fail if you come up short nobody can
[1:21:45] take your place it's already an eternal
[1:21:48] thought of God in his mind
[1:21:51] no one
[1:21:53] so therefore God is now in this life
[1:21:57] and in this age selecting it
[1:21:59] calling his thoughts calling can you say
[1:22:03] man for acts 15 14 uh Paul I believe
[1:22:07] talks about God taking out of the
[1:22:09] Gentiles uh a people for his name amen
[1:22:13] and and so in other words he's selecting
[1:22:15] a people out of the Gentiles and them
[1:22:17] people are his eternal thoughts them
[1:22:20] names that were written in the Lamb's
[1:22:21] Book of Life and he's calling them out
[1:22:24] of this Gentile dispensation to be his
[1:22:28] bride and notice the prophet said the
[1:22:30] whole of the church ages is God dealing
[1:22:33] with the Gentiles and calling a gentile
[1:22:37] bride to himself he said that makes the
[1:22:40] church ages and the fullness of the
[1:22:43] Gentiles amen uh yeah sure there's other
[1:22:46] people that will make it a man the
[1:22:48] friends of the Bride the foolish virgin
[1:22:50] or whatever amen but the message and
[1:22:53] what God is dealing with is for that
[1:22:55] Gentile bride and now we are come to the
[1:22:59] fullness of the Jim tiles we're coming
[1:23:01] to the end of it that means that the
[1:23:04] last one is about to come in or she may
[1:23:07] have already been in I don't know that's
[1:23:09] up to God that I do know this that not
[1:23:12] many people are going to receive what
[1:23:14] you have received because we're here at
[1:23:17] the fullness of the Gentile dispensation
[1:23:22] all right that's right that's right it's
[1:23:24] good
[1:23:26] the message of this age
[1:23:29] calls the bride together
[1:23:31] which is the shout
[1:23:33] so the message deals with the bride
[1:23:35] doesn't deal with the foolish virgin
[1:23:37] deals with the bride
[1:23:39] doesn't deal with everybody else it
[1:23:41] deals with the bride why because this is
[1:23:44] the only way that this bride can be
[1:23:45] called out I have to say it it's the
[1:23:48] only way that that that them Eternal
[1:23:50] thoughts can come back
[1:23:52] can you say Amen into what God
[1:23:55] originally thought to be is this message
[1:23:58] and by this message can it only happen
[1:24:00] by this message that that you you it's
[1:24:03] the only way the Rapture can happen in
[1:24:05] this age
[1:24:06] I have this message can you say Amen buy
[1:24:09] this message it's it's all to do with
[1:24:11] the message of the hour you say well
[1:24:13] you're just following a man well I all I
[1:24:15] know is as it was in the days of Noah so
[1:24:18] shall it be in the coming a revealing of
[1:24:20] the son of man thank you and and and we
[1:24:22] all know that that Prophet Noah and I
[1:24:25] might have said Moses I don't know but
[1:24:27] in as it was in the days of Noah but as
[1:24:29] we know that that Prophet Noah stood at
[1:24:31] the door of the Ark and everyone that
[1:24:33] went in that Ark had to come by way of a
[1:24:35] prophet can you say amen and as it was
[1:24:38] back then so is it today
[1:24:40] you ain't getting in that Arc by outside
[1:24:42] this Prophet you ain't getting in a
[1:24:44] Rapture outside this Prophet you want to
[1:24:46] try to be like that guy that comes
[1:24:48] through the window amen you you can try
[1:24:50] that that we already know it ain't going
[1:24:52] to happen and you say Amen you can be
[1:24:54] religious or whatever you want to be
[1:24:56] amen but but you'll go through the outer
[1:24:59] Darkness you'll go through the
[1:25:00] tribulation and and all these God knows
[1:25:02] all about that but I'm telling you a man
[1:25:04] to come into the marriage supper of the
[1:25:06] lamb for this age there is a prophet
[1:25:08] that's calling the people together for
[1:25:11] such a Time
[1:25:12] [Applause]
[1:25:17] now we as the elect of God didn't start
[1:25:20] out reflecting his thoughts but through
[1:25:23] the work of redemption we're being
[1:25:25] brought back to the original thoughts of
[1:25:26] God and it's being done through his
[1:25:29] agency
[1:25:31] amen the prophet said he's gone to
[1:25:33] prepare a place a perfect place
[1:25:36] aren't you glad for that
[1:25:38] what kind of a place a perfect place
[1:25:40] where no evil exists no sickness exists
[1:25:44] no old age exists no death exists Man On
[1:25:47] and On we can go no headaches no trials
[1:25:49] no Temptations exist you think of that

[1:25:54] the devil's got for yet no more no more
[1:25:57] no more no more you might have been here
[1:25:59] we we might have come in here worshiping
[1:26:01] god with a heavy load of things and and
[1:26:05] Satan worn on our mind but there's going
[1:26:07] to be a time that you'll worship god
[1:26:08] with nothing of that amen nothing
[1:26:11] nothing whatsoever can you say man why
[1:26:14] it's a perfect place and and the only
[1:26:16] way it can be a perfect place is no
[1:26:18] Devil's going to be there no death no
[1:26:20] suffering no sorrow no heartache he said
[1:26:23] and it's a perfect place calling you to
[1:26:27] that Perfection how many he's got the
[1:26:29] pull now amen we we fill the pool we
[1:26:32] felt the pool amen it was a pool that
[1:26:34] brought you to an altar it was a pool
[1:26:36] that brought you to this message but
[1:26:38] that pool is still there and it's
[1:26:40] causing the groaning within what is it
[1:26:43] it's a perfect place calling you at an
[1:26:46] imperfect individual but it's calling
[1:26:48] you to that perfection
[1:26:51] amen it's calling you and notice what he
[1:26:53] says and you have to be perfect to get
[1:26:55] there
[1:26:57] ah now that's where everybody gets
[1:27:00] down-hearted and their their jaws drop
[1:27:02] and how am I going to be there then

[1:27:12] Kingdom everybody say it's a perfect
[1:27:14] Kingdom now people get downhearted but

[1:28:07] perfect word wow there is truly a
[1:28:10] perfect place and by him sending a
[1:28:13] perfect word he has intended it shows
[1:28:16] his intent that he has called you to
[1:28:19] that place

[1:28:23] perfect place if he didn't have means
[1:28:25] for you to come to a Perfection so you

[1:29:57] whatever and and he's it was there
[1:29:59] before uh a board of Congress or senate
[1:30:03] or whatever it was and and and they
[1:30:05] asked him how do you know how do you
[1:30:07] know that that that these ain't Russians
[1:30:10] or this ain't this or China or whatever
[1:30:12] how do you know he said well sir he says
[1:30:14] there ain't nothing like that that we
[1:30:16] man could ever come up with to make such
[1:30:19] an object as as what we've been seeing
[1:30:22] he says there ain't nothing human
[1:30:23] possible uh uh that that we could come
[1:30:26] up with that could go through a a a
[1:30:28] category 4 hurricane and stay right
[1:30:31] there and never move one one bit and and
[1:30:34] going right in the middle of it and
[1:30:35] staying right in the air and then all of
[1:30:37] a sudden just disappear he says it it
[1:30:40] just can't be and and all these things
[1:30:42] better profit in this age told us what
[1:30:44] it is they're investigating angels and
[1:30:48] he said in one of these days they're
[1:30:49] gonna pick you up and take you home and
[1:30:52] brother that is exciting to me that God
[1:30:55] still has the ministry of angels and
[1:30:58] they are with us they never leave us
[1:31:00] they're for us even the Bible says he'll
[1:31:03] give his angels charge over you
[1:31:06] they're ministering angels
[1:31:09] but God didn't have angels to die for us
[1:31:12] Angels don't live within us
[1:31:14] amen there's the ministry of the Holy
[1:31:16] Spirit
[1:31:17] can you say amen amen it all goes into
[1:31:20] the same uh the work but then there's
[1:31:23] the agency of man human agency brother
[1:31:26] Brown said God does nothing without
[1:31:27] human agency he said see he has to use
[1:31:30] someone God only speaks through human
[1:31:32] lips he made men his agency it's God
[1:31:36] working his way back into man to worship
[1:31:40] and be worshiped through man God's
[1:31:43] agency God does nothing outside of a man
[1:31:46] being his agent his helper ain't that
[1:31:49] right amen we look at Matthew 9 37 amen
[1:31:54] through 38 Jesus said to his disciples
[1:31:56] the Harvest truly is plentiful and but
[1:31:59] the labors are few pray ye therefore the
[1:32:03] lord of the Harvest that he will send
[1:32:05] forth laborers into his Harvest well and
[1:32:09] and yet he was the lord of the Harvest
[1:32:11] ain't that right he's telling them now
[1:32:14] it's it's the the laborers are few pray
[1:32:17] pray to the Lord of the Harvest and yet
[1:32:19] he's the lord of the Harvest ain't that
[1:32:21] right but here's the prophet saying what
[1:32:23] he was saying to them is pray to me that
[1:32:26] I will send laborers into my Harvest
[1:32:29] which I'm just telling you it's such a
[1:32:31] needy thing but see part of it lays the
[1:32:34] inhuman beings he says see the kingdom
[1:32:37] of God lays within the human being so
[1:32:40] Jesus is telling them you ask me what I
[1:32:44] know that needs to be done he said but
[1:32:47] he couldn't do anything until they asked
[1:32:49] him
[1:32:50] can you say amen that's right God ain't
[1:32:53] going to bypass what he has already
[1:32:54] called to be part of his ministry
[1:32:58] people say well I don't need a preacher
[1:33:00] because I got the Holy Ghost
[1:33:02] the Holy Ghost will lead you to one
[1:33:07] James 4 2 says you have not because you
[1:33:10] ask not
[1:33:11] ain't that right now notice what the
[1:33:13] prophet said he says he God made himself
[1:33:15] so bound together with man that he works
[1:33:18] only through the agency of man he chose
[1:33:21] man and veils himself inside see he
[1:33:26] hides himself from the unbeliever and
[1:33:28] reveals himself to who he will why
[1:33:32] because he hides himself through men
[1:33:35] in men work through men and in every
[1:33:39] generation everybody say every
[1:33:40] generation God speaks to his people
[1:33:43] through human lips he always chooses
[1:33:46] someone or something that he can use
[1:33:49] ain't that right another place brother
[1:33:51] Brown said God keeps his word now you
[1:33:53] think of that God keeps his word by
[1:33:56] representing himself through human
[1:33:58] agency amen God keeps his word by
[1:34:01] representing himself through human
[1:34:03] agency so then as we see amen through
[1:34:07] our opening scripture that that God that
[1:34:09] man does not and cannot operate on his
[1:34:13] own amen uh it's it's not whatever God
[1:34:17] has given you to do you ain't on your
[1:34:19] own you you can't say well I'm going to
[1:34:21] do this and I'm going to do that go
[1:34:23] ahead make up your plans but if you're a
[1:34:25] part of the ministry of God you've got
[1:34:28] to be surrendered to God because it's
[1:34:31] his ministry
[1:34:32] ain't that right see man the prophet
[1:34:35] said it's a failure to begin with he's
[1:34:37] only an agent to which God works through
[1:34:40] and God works his own will
[1:34:45] God works his own purpose not your
[1:34:47] purpose not my purpose God works his own
[1:34:50] purpose
[1:34:53] so then man as we see in our opening
[1:34:56] scripture man gets his commission from
[1:34:58] God God tells him what to say God tells
[1:35:01] him what to do and where to go that's
[1:35:03] why it's so important Amen to find out
[1:35:05] what God would want you to do and stay
[1:35:08] with it
[1:35:09] amen I I find a lot of people are just
[1:35:11] so unsettled Unfaithful and you can't
[1:35:15] find hardly anybody faithful today and
[1:35:18] it's it's because they're doing their
[1:35:19] own thing they want to do what they want
[1:35:22] to do they want to go where they want to
[1:35:23] go they want to see what they want to
[1:35:25] see they want to hear what they want to
[1:35:26] hear and and and it's what they want to
[1:35:28] do
[1:35:31] and and so but but if you're in the if
[1:35:36] if you're in the the the the the uh the
[1:35:40] ministry of God angels receive their
[1:35:43] commission from God
[1:35:45] ain't that right now I'll say it this
[1:35:47] way the Holy Spirit too
[1:35:49] which is God himself but he's on a
[1:35:51] commission
[1:35:52] he ain't here just to tickle your fancy
[1:35:55] he ain't here to do something that he
[1:35:57] ain't sent to do
[1:35:59] and the Bible says that when the spirit
[1:36:01] of truth comes he will lead you and
[1:36:02] guide you into all truth
[1:36:05] well it's true and you say well I got
[1:36:07] the Holy Ghost and you still wear your
[1:36:09] britches you women and you still cut
[1:36:11] your hair and you still leaning on the
[1:36:12] trinitarian doctrine and you're still
[1:36:14] this and you're still that that ain't
[1:36:16] what the Holy Ghost was sent to do
[1:36:18] he is on a direct commission from God
[1:36:21] can you say Amen
[1:36:24] it's true amen the Holy Ghost ain't here
[1:36:28] to lead you into man-made ideas it ain't
[1:36:31] here to lead you to into bondage it
[1:36:34] ain't here to keep you as a sinner amen
[1:36:37] a religion all religious people are most
[1:36:39] the time or just religious sinners
[1:36:41] and brother Brown said a religious
[1:36:43] spirit is the worst Spirit there is
[1:36:45] can't tell them they need the Lord can't
[1:36:47] tell them they need to go Amen to get up
[1:36:49] higher you can't set them free from the
[1:36:51] sins they get mad at you
[1:36:54] can you say Amen well it's it's just the
[1:36:57] truth but see the holy spirit is under
[1:37:00] commission and and every every human
[1:37:03] that is part of this this ministry of
[1:37:06] God the human agency has a commission as
[1:37:09] well ain't that right amen and this word
[1:37:12] commission is a commandment or decree
[1:37:15] amen uh Webster talking of commission
[1:37:18] said it's a formal written warrant
[1:37:20] granting the power to perform various
[1:37:24] Acts or duties an authorization or
[1:37:27] command to act in a prescribed manner or
[1:37:30] to perfect to perform prescribed acts
[1:37:34] ain't that right yes sir see so now what
[1:37:38] what makes this human agency of God a
[1:37:41] man uh different from denominations and
[1:37:43] seminaries and theologians and Etc well
[1:37:46] can I say it this way God never sent a
[1:37:49] man in theologians
[1:37:51] he don't work through theologians God
[1:37:53] never sent denomination he doesn't work
[1:37:56] through denominations he never sent
[1:37:58] seminaries he doesn't work through
[1:38:00] seminaries well yeah that's that's true
[1:38:03] so they're here without a commission
[1:38:05] amen but but we find what makes the
[1:38:09] human agency of God that is a part of
[1:38:12] his ministry different is in the message
[1:38:14] Messiah Amen brother Branham talks about
[1:38:17] us a man being Messiah it's
[1:38:21] can you say that with me Messiahs I am
[1:38:25] I'm a messiah it and the word Messiah is
[1:38:28] the anointed one which Jesus was the
[1:38:31] Messiah and he was anointed
[1:38:35] ain't that right amen so we are Messiah
[1:38:39] it's well what was it that made him the
[1:38:42] Messiah what made the Messiah well just
[1:38:45] go through some scriptures here John 1
[1:38:47] 14 the word was made flesh and dwelt
[1:38:50] Among Us
[1:38:51] right the word everybody say the word
[1:38:53] was made flesh amen a second Corinthians
[1:38:57] 5 19 break it in God was in Christ
[1:39:00] everybody say God was in Christ amen uh
[1:39:03] Colossians 2 and 9 for in him everybody
[1:39:06] say in him dwelleth all the fullness of
[1:39:09] the godhead bodily
[1:39:11] ain't that right in him well John 1 4 in
[1:39:14] him everybody say in him Amen in him was
[1:39:18] life and the life was the light of men
[1:39:21] ain't that right now so that was that's
[1:39:23] what made Messiah not a churchgoer
[1:39:27] not knowing the Scrolls not men able to
[1:39:30] memorize scripture not because he had uh
[1:39:33] uh uh a bachelor degree or some kind of
[1:39:36] a degree that didn't make him Messiah
[1:39:38] God was in Christ that word was made
[1:39:41] flesh
[1:39:44] amen predestination what God
[1:39:46] predestinated him to be became flesh
[1:39:48] amen
[1:39:50] now notice the prophet says he wasn't
[1:39:52] only word but he was God himself the
[1:39:56] Dynamics
[1:39:57] can you say that with me the Dynamics
[1:40:00] amen go go listen to uh it is the rising
[1:40:03] of the sun brother Brown talks about
[1:40:05] them Dynamics
[1:40:06] amen and he puts them Dynamics not in in
[1:40:09] a man of 2000 years ago he puts them
[1:40:12] same Dynamics in the church today
[1:40:16] yes sir see he wasn't only the word but
[1:40:19] he was God himself the Dynamics in the
[1:40:22] word now this saint this is the same
[1:40:25] formula that makes Messiah X
[1:40:29] ain't that right all that God was he
[1:40:32] poured into Christ and all that Christ
[1:40:33] was he poured into the church
[1:40:36] amen so it isn't uh uh so so we're
[1:40:39] looking now amen that this is the day
[1:40:42] and age amen when this is being realized
[1:40:45] amen John 14 20 at that day this day the
[1:40:49] prophet declared it was this day amen
[1:40:52] you shall know that I am in my father
[1:40:54] you and me and I in you
[1:40:57] then you say man it's his ministry
[1:41:01] his agency this is the day of the
[1:41:04] manifestation of the sons of God Amen
[1:41:07] brother Brown said see what it is it's
[1:41:09] the spirit of God coming into these bins
[1:41:10] so perfectly until their ministry will
[1:41:13] be so close like Christ till it will
[1:41:15] join him and his church together now can
[1:41:18] I say this that this is the day that
[1:41:20] there is no other Ministry outside of
[1:41:22] Christ's Ministry
[1:41:25] amen that's it's Christ's Ministry
[1:41:29] we're coming by a prophet coming so
[1:41:32] close that is joining us with Christ
[1:41:37] that by a prophet God spoke through him
[1:41:40] and called us miss Jesus Christ
[1:41:43] it ain't no other Ministry outside of
[1:41:45] Christ's Ministry
[1:41:48] now and we know we're here because the
[1:41:50] message of the the hour is a clear sign
[1:41:53] to us that we're here we don't regard
[1:41:56] this message just another one that Come
[1:41:57] Through the Ages we regard this as
[1:42:00] something else it's a sign
[1:42:02] it's a sign
[1:42:04] that every scripture that is purported
[1:42:06] to the bride is now here to be finalized
[1:42:11] how many scriptures have laid dormant
[1:42:13] has been brought to life in this age
[1:42:17] how many people just just just
[1:42:19] even even those that did not believe the
[1:42:22] message but were around brother Branham
[1:42:24] and and and seeing the ministry and
[1:42:27] things and and uh so many of them
[1:42:30] ministers uh uh says it reminded us
[1:42:34] of the Bible days
[1:42:36] we talked about it we talked about it
[1:42:38] we've seen you all that but now we've
[1:42:40] seen them
[1:42:41] amen everything we'd read about what
[1:42:43] Jesus did we saw it in this day
[1:42:45] amen it's just the truth
[1:42:49] amen so brother Brown said see uh uh one
[1:42:53] time he traveled speaking of God over
[1:42:56] the children of Israel in a pillar of
[1:42:58] fire when he settled on the mountain
[1:42:59] even nothing could touch it it had to be
[1:43:02] killed see if they did then he came down
[1:43:05] and lived in his son and he lived there
[1:43:07] man could touch him but he was virgin
[1:43:09] born see he gave his life his blood that
[1:43:13] the sexual born people could come back
[1:43:16] into fellowship and have fellowship with
[1:43:18] him and be part of him so it's God not
[1:43:22] in the pillar fire not God in Christ
[1:43:24] it's in you
[1:43:28] the god in that pillar fires in you
[1:43:31] the God in Jesus Christ is in you
[1:43:36] [Applause]
[1:43:38] this ministry has brought us to this
[1:43:39] place
[1:43:44] and it's the same formula
[1:43:48] same ingredient producing the same
[1:43:50] results
[1:43:51] the word made flesh in your skin Christ
[1:43:53] in you the hope of glory
[1:43:55] and Jesus said the words that I speak
[1:43:57] unto you their spirit and they are life
[1:44:00] so the word being spirit and life is
[1:44:04] Christ
[1:44:06] and you say man I hope you're getting
[1:44:08] following me now this the word your
[1:44:12] spirit in life he says I I'm the word
[1:44:15] right the word made flesh that word in
[1:44:18] the bride is spirit and life that's what
[1:44:21] Christ is the word spirit and life can
[1:44:24] you say Amen so now the message of the
[1:44:27] hour is Christ revealed do you believe
[1:44:29] that amen it wasn't just some uh a
[1:44:32] theologian it wasn't just some formal uh
[1:44:35] uh uh uh train of thought or or whatever
[1:44:38] it was Christ revealed both spirit and
[1:44:42] life the word made spirit and life
[1:44:47] praise the Lord
[1:44:49] when Jesus walked the Earth he had the
[1:44:51] spirit of God without measure
[1:44:53] if your brother Brown said now is now is
[1:44:57] or God is in you if you have the Holy
[1:44:59] Spirit God is in you in a portion but it
[1:45:03] was in him without measure he had the
[1:45:07] fullness of God in him but now it's
[1:45:10] measured out to each one
[1:45:13] see so so it's it's not uh uh one man
[1:45:18] that's why we do not we do not hang get
[1:45:20] hung up on personalities
[1:45:23] as much as great Ministries that we have
[1:45:26] we do not get hung up on one minister
[1:45:30] and build our faith upon his ministry
[1:45:33] now God sent a prophet to us all
[1:45:36] ain't that right
[1:45:40] and yet we do not get hung up on the on
[1:45:42] the man
[1:45:44] we hang our very Soul upon the message
[1:45:47] he brought
[1:45:49] ain't that right
[1:45:51] but it ain't God in in the fullness of
[1:45:54] God in one man I believe the fullness of
[1:45:57] God is in the church body
[1:45:59] and each one of us that are part of that
[1:46:01] body has a measure of the spirit of God
[1:46:05] it does not give us less power it does
[1:46:08] not give us less Authority it does not
[1:46:10] give us whatever or less ability than
[1:46:13] than he had can you say man it ain't
[1:46:17] that at all brother actually brother
[1:46:19] Brown said he's had more success in my
[1:46:21] this my Ministry than he had in his own
[1:46:23] Ministry when he walked the Earth
[1:46:28] this is the son of man Ministry
[1:46:33] same power can you say that with me same
[1:46:36] power
[1:46:37] same Ministry
[1:46:38] same anointing same Authority
[1:46:41] same works
[1:46:43] do you believe that
[1:46:45] same an awning not in a word begotten
[1:46:48] body not in a created body that was
[1:46:50] created in the womb of Mary but now in a
[1:46:52] redeemed body
[1:46:54] same Ministry in a redeemed body same an
[1:46:57] awning in a redeemed body
[1:46:59] same Works in a redeemed body
[1:47:02] [Applause]
[1:47:04] he's been accomplishing
[1:47:07] what he's wanted all along
[1:47:10] and here you are to prove it
[1:47:13] you are his victory that's what the
[1:47:15] prophet said you're his victory he died
[1:47:18] for this purpose
[1:47:19] you realize that he died for this
[1:47:22] purpose
[1:47:25] so what we are is is is God Christ in
[1:47:29] you and it's making him the same
[1:47:31] yesterday today and forever
[1:47:33] because it's proving by by working in
[1:47:36] human flesh our flesh that he hasn't
[1:47:39] changed
[1:47:40] today it's not the fullness of God again
[1:47:42] in one man but it's the fullness of God
[1:47:45] in his church
[1:47:46] but by the word being fully restored
[1:47:49] Christ has fully returned to his church
[1:47:54] by the word being fully restored Christ
[1:47:57] has fully returned to his church now I'm
[1:48:02] going to try to hurry now but brother
[1:48:05] Brown said here is the secret the word
[1:48:07] is in the bride
[1:48:08] the word in the church nope the word in
[1:48:11] the bride
[1:48:12] the word in the denomination no the word
[1:48:14] is in the bride
[1:48:16] ain't that right and the mind of Christ
[1:48:18] to know what he wants done with the word
[1:48:20] she does it in his name she has thus
[1:48:23] saith the Lord
[1:48:25] then it is germanized so the Holy Spirit
[1:48:28] uh Waters it until it is grown and
[1:48:31] serves its purpose they do only his will
[1:48:35] why he's able to have preeminence in the
[1:48:38] church in his body in a group of
[1:48:43] sex-born uh corruptable flesh and yet
[1:48:47] he's able to have preeminence in that
[1:48:50] body can you say man what is the
[1:48:53] greatest victory over the devil
[1:48:55] that God could have besides taking your
[1:48:59] vessel and having total preeminence
[1:49:02] to where they do only his will no one
[1:49:05] can persuade them any different they
[1:49:07] have thus saith the Lord or they keep
[1:49:08] still then they will do the works of God
[1:49:10] for it is himself in them continuing his
[1:49:13] word to fulfill as he did complete in
[1:49:15] his day can you say amen he did not
[1:49:18] complete everything in his day in it I
[1:49:21] did spoken of the Messiah of first
[1:49:23] coming but there was another Ministry to
[1:49:26] come that spoke of the Bride ain't that
[1:49:28] right and here he is in this age we are
[1:49:31] flesh of his flesh born of his bone life
[1:49:34] of his life power of his power she is
[1:49:38] him
[1:49:39] she is him
[1:49:42] [Music]
[1:49:43] why would God make us Messiahs
[1:49:47] because he got a commission it's the
[1:49:49] commission
[1:49:50] it's the commission he gave us can you
[1:49:52] say man second Corinthians 5 20 says now
[1:49:55] then we are ambassadors for Christ
[1:49:59] and what is an ambassador acting or a
[1:50:01] it's an it's one acting for or a
[1:50:05] representative acting as or a
[1:50:07] representative so then we see that this
[1:50:10] Ambassador represents only one he
[1:50:13] doesn't represent another or speak for
[1:50:15] another he he doesn't promote something
[1:50:17] else he isn't a double agent or double
[1:50:19] tongue or whatever you want to call it
[1:50:22] Matthew 12 25 Jesus says every Kingdom
[1:50:26] divided against itself uh uh is brought
[1:50:29] to Desolation amen and every city or
[1:50:33] house divided against itself it shall
[1:50:36] not stand ain't that right now see so
[1:50:39] then the Church of God cannot be divided
[1:50:42] or worked contrary to the will of God
[1:50:45] can't do it not the ministry of God Amen
[1:50:48] because that would that would mean that
[1:50:50] his purpose would be annihilated
[1:50:54] ain't that right his purpose would come
[1:50:57] to not we look we look at just in the
[1:50:59] natural amen when when it's it's not the
[1:51:03] it's not the the the foreign countries
[1:51:06] that are killing America
[1:51:08] is the fighting with him
[1:51:10] it's the division within America
[1:51:13] can you say Amen
[1:51:15] that's right it's the it's the worm at
[1:51:17] the core of the Apple
[1:51:19] a man see so we we looked at an and
[1:51:23] every Ambassador in the natural that
[1:51:26] stands for uh uh their country they must
[1:51:28] be totally convinced of the one or uh of
[1:51:31] uh that he or she is representing a man
[1:51:36] an ambassador who goes into foreign
[1:51:38] countries they're representing their own
[1:51:40] country they speak for their own country
[1:51:42] and all the power of that country is
[1:51:46] behind them
[1:51:47] ain't that right so so I looked it up
[1:51:50] Ambassador it's the highest ranking
[1:51:52] think of that of the highest ranking
[1:51:55] person who represents his or her own
[1:51:57] government while living in another
[1:51:59] country amen see and and this government
[1:52:02] see they represent their own government
[1:52:04] and government is the continuous
[1:52:06] exercise of authority ain't that right
[1:52:09] they're the highest ranking person
[1:52:12] God doesn't beat someone that uh uh or
[1:52:15] or or or or or whatever the the the the
[1:52:18] the United States ain't gonna pick just
[1:52:20] some low bum or or some home whatever
[1:52:24] you understand what I'm saying amen but
[1:52:26] he's going to be they picked the the
[1:52:28] right one and put them in the highest
[1:52:31] ranking uh position to represent them in
[1:52:34] other foreign countries
[1:52:36] [Music]
[1:52:38] it's true
[1:52:41] and then they they have to stand by it
[1:52:44] amen
[1:52:46] the government has to stand by it
[1:52:49] well the government is a continuous
[1:52:51] exercise of authority amen so there's an
[1:52:54] authority behind the behind that
[1:52:56] Ambassador so the Ambassador is the
[1:52:59] mouthpiece or the voice of his own
[1:53:01] government he speaks in the name of his
[1:53:04] government ain't that right
[1:53:06] I I think it was uh Alaska that that uh
[1:53:10] was was to be bought was up for sale and
[1:53:13] and there there was a representative I
[1:53:16] think it was Steward Seward and and it's
[1:53:20] I believe it's known as Seward's folly
[1:53:23] but they came uh I believe it was the
[1:53:26] Russians that did not want Alaska but as
[1:53:29] as I've read the uh they they uh they
[1:53:33] didn't want it really it was to them or
[1:53:36] to anyone Alaska was just peace that
[1:53:39] they didn't no one wanted but they they
[1:53:41] offered a a fairly cheap price and so
[1:53:44] Seward uh it was in the meeting with him
[1:53:47] and he tried to call back home and he
[1:53:49] couldn't get a hold of anyone uh uh and
[1:53:52] and some reason couldn't get connected
[1:53:54] or whatever so he spoke as an ambassador
[1:53:58] and he told him we'll take it
[1:54:00] we want it
[1:54:02] and so they signed the papers and all
[1:54:04] that and when he got home
[1:54:06] they're like we don't want Alaska
[1:54:09] what are you doing well
[1:54:11] you can get a hold of you
[1:54:13] and the United States government had to
[1:54:16] back up that word
[1:54:18] because they sent him as a
[1:54:20] representative
[1:54:21] ain't that right now if they if they're
[1:54:23] going to do that in the natural now it's
[1:54:25] not that we can't get a hold of God all
[1:54:27] that because the prophet says that we
[1:54:30] have the mind of God
[1:54:33] and we do only his will you understand
[1:54:35] what I'm saying but so you're here
[1:54:38] in direct commission
[1:54:41] knowing the will of God and I want to
[1:54:44] say this and
[1:54:46] that's why it's so important for prayer
[1:54:53] we know a lot of times we know the will
[1:54:56] of God you hear the message and and the
[1:54:58] message and I know I'm gonna be honest
[1:55:00] and as I've told you before the message
[1:55:02] covers it all
[1:55:04] it covers everything if if you really
[1:55:06] just have an open heart the message
[1:55:09] covers it it'll cover your personal life
[1:55:11] it it covers how you should be a father
[1:55:13] how you should be a mother how how you
[1:55:15] should be deacons how you should be
[1:55:16] young people it it I mean it covers all
[1:55:19] aspects of everything how you should
[1:55:22] look for a a spouse uh uh how you should
[1:55:25] conduct yourself
[1:55:27] it conducts it how deacons should be how
[1:55:30] how how you know everything it just as
[1:55:34] pastors should be and ministers and da
[1:55:37] da you just everything so the will of
[1:55:40] God is made known and a lot of times
[1:55:43] even in our personal uh situations that
[1:55:46] we're we're dealing with like like where
[1:55:49] to move and what to do and and all these
[1:55:51] things amen there's there's you should
[1:55:55] never act on anything uh unless you have
[1:55:59] Direction I mean clear Direction now I
[1:56:03] know that it was you know the we throw
[1:56:05] these Saints well it's the will of God
[1:56:06] yeah the Lord told me the Lord told me
[1:56:08] and and you know good and well it's not
[1:56:10] the will of God it's it's just it's
[1:56:15] it's just really you know we've been
[1:56:17] taught never act out of discouragement
[1:56:19] never make decisions out of
[1:56:21] discouragement because most of the time
[1:56:22] you're going to make the decisions never
[1:56:24] never act when when you're going through
[1:56:26] turmoil in your life never make
[1:56:28] decisions because you're going to make
[1:56:30] the wrong ones half the time
[1:56:32] [Music]

[1:58:36] better just stay with what God you

[1:58:41] because the winds are going to change
[1:58:42] again
[1:58:43] winds are going to blow seas are going
[1:58:45] to change
[1:58:46] ain't that right
[1:58:48] then you're going to say then then

[1:58:52] something's changed for them they're all
[1:58:55] kind again

[1:58:58] really wants me to stay after all
[1:59:02] well give us some more time
[1:59:07] when's it gonna blow again
[1:59:10] but what's happened we understand that
[1:59:12] it's a will of God and we remain in the
[1:59:15] will of God regardless
[1:59:17] it's the same thing with marriage give
[1:59:19] it some time you butterflies when you
[1:59:21] first met her
[1:59:23] and you first met him it's all gooey
[1:59:26] get married just give it time
[1:59:33] you have to pick up a socks and you know
[1:59:35] how it is
[1:59:37] man he's sitting back home so mama can
[1:59:39] train him how to clean house
[1:59:42] foreign
[1:59:45] but when it's all said and done the
[1:59:47] wind's going to change again
[1:59:49] you're going to find out you love them
[1:59:51] better than you ever did
[1:59:53] ain't that right through all the ups and
[1:59:56] downs through all the nonsense or all
[1:59:58] the disappointments and all that and
[2:00:00] even the prophet tells you you're going
[2:00:02] to have disappointments
[2:00:04] that give it time can you say Amen we're
[2:00:09] not a people that just blows with the
[2:00:11] Wind
[2:00:12] we're a people that is set here to do
[2:00:15] the will of God and if it's God's will
[2:00:17] we'll do God's Will and only his will
[2:00:21] and we get to the place where Satan
[2:00:22] don't know what to do with this I send
[2:00:24] him a trial I send them through
[2:00:26] hurricanes I send them through tornadoes
[2:00:28] I sit everything their way and they
[2:00:30] still remain
[2:00:33] then we begin to understand the
[2:00:35] scripture he that endureth to the end
[2:00:37] the same shall be saved
[2:00:39] endure can you say Amen you endure and
[2:00:43] that's what makes pillars in a church
[2:00:44] that's what makes Faithful Men and
[2:00:46] that's what Paul told Timothy commit
[2:00:48] this into Faithful Men
[2:00:51] commit it
[2:00:52] and a prophet didn't just preach a
[2:00:54] message just for it to go when he died
[2:00:57] he committed to Faithful Men faithful
[2:01:01] women faithful young people that's going
[2:01:03] to remain in this message Stay True to
[2:01:06] this message
[2:01:08] regardless of what comes it's the
[2:01:11] message that must endure
[2:01:22] that was free
[2:01:26] so we speak
[2:01:29] the Ambassador
[2:01:31] the ambassador of the United States his
[2:01:35] word is the word of the United States
[2:01:37] notice he represents the mindset the
[2:01:39] position the attitude and the authority
[2:01:41] of the United States
[2:01:43] and you say man
[2:01:44] an ambassador of America would be a poor
[2:01:46] excuse for an ambassador if he didn't
[2:01:48] know who he represented
[2:01:50] and how to represent his Nation
[2:01:52] ain't that right if he didn't know what
[2:01:55] his his Nation stood for how could he be
[2:01:57] an ambassador see so then his Ambassador
[2:02:00] is the attitude of the USA or his
[2:02:03] attitude his authority his words his
[2:02:06] action his message comes from the USA
[2:02:11] he's an ambassador of America ain't that
[2:02:14] right to see him is to see the
[2:02:16] government of the United States to hear
[2:02:19] him is to hear the government of the
[2:02:21] United States to befriend him is to
[2:02:24] befriend the government of the United
[2:02:25] States see so if you want to get
[2:02:28] acquainted with the ways with the
[2:02:29] attitude with the The Authority the
[2:02:31] power of the United States government
[2:02:33] get to know the Ambassador
[2:02:35] he'll tell you what they are he'll
[2:02:37] represent them can you say Amen oh my
[2:02:41] brother Brown said if the president of
[2:02:42] the United States would make me an
[2:02:44] ambassador to Germany my words then in
[2:02:46] Germany would be exactly what the
[2:02:48] president told me to say and if I said
[2:02:50] them what he told me to say then
[2:02:52] everything that's in the United States
[2:02:53] is behind them words
[2:02:57] oh
[2:03:00] we're just talking
[2:03:01] and that government is rotten
[2:03:05] not governmental compromise
[2:03:07] that government will leave you out in
[2:03:09] the in the desert sometimes and just to
[2:03:10] cover their hide they'll act like they
[2:03:12] don't know you
[2:03:13] but now we're going to talk about God
[2:03:16] can you say Amen we're talking about a
[2:03:18] faithful God
[2:03:19] a faithful that will endure a faithful
[2:03:21] that'll see his word through and if you
[2:03:23] stand behind his word he'll see you
[2:03:25] through
[2:03:26] if you're standing upon his word and
[2:03:28] you're declaring him and you're
[2:03:29] representing him he will not let you
[2:03:31] down he has sent angels to stand by you
[2:03:33] to protect you to guard you
[2:03:38] I've thought about America brother
[2:03:40] Branham how to go and Beyond and out in
[2:03:42] other countries and he said there'd be
[2:03:44] snipers out there with her guns and
[2:03:45] right at him
[2:03:47] he talked about it
[2:03:49] the third sniper he's the devil's after
[2:03:51] me on every end remember them which
[2:03:53] doctors that got out there and stood
[2:03:55] outside that tent and started working up
[2:03:57] a storm remember he said likely to blow
[2:03:59] that storm but he didn't worry he was an
[2:04:02] ambassador
[2:04:03] and he began to pray and God drove that
[2:04:05] storm away the devil was defeated why he
[2:04:09] represented a government that was higher
[2:04:12] than any other government
[2:04:13] yeah
[2:04:15] now notice Colossians 3 17 is this okay
[2:04:18] amen Colossians 3 17 says whatsoever you
[2:04:21] do in word or deed do all in the name of
[2:04:24] the Lord Jesus brother Branham talking
[2:04:27] about that time he went to that
[2:04:29] um uh man I don't know what that that
[2:04:31] individual was called uh uh hypnosis or
[2:04:35] something and and but anyway there she
[2:04:38] that lady raised the table up in the air
[2:04:41] and then she challenged anyone to come
[2:04:43] and knock that table off in some big old
[2:04:45] bruisers man muscled up guys said we
[2:04:47] could do that and then went over there
[2:04:48] and they couldn't get it down they'd
[2:04:49] trying to get it down and brother
[2:04:51] Branham uh had went there to see what it
[2:04:54] was all about and and I know he was I
[2:04:56] know he was led of the Lord to go there
[2:04:58] and and as he's watching and he realized
[2:05:01] it was demon power that was at work and
[2:05:04] that demon power recognized him in the
[2:05:06] audience amen but said and challenged
[2:05:09] him and says I I heard you're a minister
[2:05:11] she says I challenge you to come and
[2:05:13] knock this off
[2:05:14] I put this table out of there and put it
[2:05:17] on the ground and he he says well and
[2:05:19] and something to the fact uh says they
[2:05:22] tell me you're a preacher and and she
[2:05:23] said what do you think this is and he
[2:05:26] said I said it's the devil and she said
[2:05:28] well if you got so much power then knock
[2:05:30] it down he says I do not have power he
[2:05:33] says but I represent one who does see
[2:05:35] that that's the difference ain't that
[2:05:37] right that's why you'd never have to
[2:05:39] back down to the devil I don't care what
[2:05:40] it is that the devil is messing with
[2:05:42] your family if the devil's messing with
[2:05:44] your children if the devil's messing
[2:05:45] with the church if the devil if the
[2:05:46] devil's messing with you something in
[2:05:48] your job and the devil's trying to get
[2:05:49] you fired and the devil's trying to amen
[2:05:51] and you recognize what that power is
[2:05:53] coming from you don't have to get mad at
[2:05:55] the boss you don't have to get mad at
[2:05:57] your wife you don't have to get mad at
[2:05:58] your husband you don't have to get mad
[2:06:00] at your children you don't have to get
[2:06:01] mad at the preacher you don't have to
[2:06:03] get mad at nobody except you recognize
[2:06:05] that it's the devil trying to come in
[2:06:07] and challenge you to see where you are
[2:06:10] be as a representative of Heaven you've
[2:06:12] got every Power
[2:06:15] and that's what that's what brother
[2:06:17] Brown see he says in the name of the
[2:06:19] father son of Holy Ghost I command you
[2:06:20] and that chair or that table never come
[2:06:22] down he said in the name of whatever
[2:06:24] William Branham you come down and it
[2:06:26] never happened and he says he says then
[2:06:28] I said and I command that table to fall
[2:06:31] in the name of Jesus Christ and he said
[2:06:33] he'll lock the broke off all four legs
[2:06:35] off that table as I slammed on the floor
[2:06:37] I'm telling you the devil recognizes the
[2:06:39] representatives of this message of the
[2:06:42] name of Jesus Christ can you say amen I
[2:06:45] believe that do you believe that yes sir
[2:06:48] he recognizes the name of Jesus
[2:06:50] [Music]
[2:06:52] he recognizes the name of Jesus
[2:06:55] I remember one man talking and and you
[2:06:57] you you young people never get involved
[2:06:59] in it don't ever try it but a man that
[2:07:02] had just become a Christian he had he
[2:07:04] had been involved in Witchcraft and and
[2:07:06] things like that and and there was an
[2:07:07] eight ball his friends brought over an
[2:07:09] eight ball and they were trying to get
[2:07:12] him to get back into it and he said no
[2:07:14] he said I'm I'm I'm I'm a Christian I'm
[2:07:17] a Believer and and he said well let me
[2:07:20] try something
[2:07:21] and so he he they were asking questions
[2:07:25] and it would it would answer back and he
[2:07:27] recognized he knew that there was a
[2:07:29] power of an of a demon and he put there
[2:07:32] and he says is Jesus Christ Lord of all
[2:07:35] and he says that thing shot across the
[2:07:37] room
[2:07:38] and he put it back on there and he
[2:07:41] started asking questions and it would
[2:07:42] answer and he says again I ask you is
[2:07:45] Jesus Christ Lord of all it fell went
[2:07:48] across the room see the devil knows
[2:07:50] exactly
[2:07:51] he knows who a Believer is he knows who
[2:07:53] Jesus Christ is and when brother Branham
[2:07:55] said you are Miss Jesus Christ he wasn't
[2:07:57] just throwing that out there every Power
[2:08:00] Of Heaven is behind you it represents
[2:08:03] you you don't have to walk if you don't
[2:08:04] have to be discouraged you don't have to
[2:08:06] question God you don't have to moan and
[2:08:08] groan stand in your position as the
[2:08:10] ministry of Christ can you say Amen why
[2:08:12] amen your children are yours
[2:08:15] [Music]
[2:08:16] you believe that now notice Jesus Christ
[2:08:19] was an ambassador of Heaven amen he was
[2:08:22] God's agent brother Brown said that for
[2:08:24] God so loved the world that He Sent His
[2:08:26] only begotten son he sent them ain't
[2:08:28] that right he come to save he come to
[2:08:31] set captives free he come to heal he
[2:08:32] come to redeem and God said God
[2:08:35] determined that every name written in
[2:08:37] the Lamb's Book of Life would be
[2:08:38] delivered you believe that I still hold
[2:08:41] to that do you
[2:08:43] yes sir I believe that I still hold to
[2:08:46] that and Jesus said all power both in
[2:08:48] Heaven and Earth has been given unto me
[2:08:49] see you can't get to God without the son
[2:08:51] you can't get to heaven without the son
[2:08:55] he's an ambassador you can't get saved
[2:08:58] without the son your sins cannot be put
[2:09:00] in God's sea of forgetfulness without
[2:09:02] the son you will not be in the first
[2:09:04] resurrection without the son that's why
[2:09:06] Psalms 2 12 says kiss the son
[2:09:09] lest he be angry and you perish from the
[2:09:12] way make him welcome entertain him
[2:09:15] ain't that right yes sir well then what
[2:09:18] about God's Ambassador today
[2:09:21] well in Luke 13 35 Jesus says behold
[2:09:24] your house is left unto you desolate and
[2:09:26] verily I say unto you you shall not see
[2:09:29] me until you until the time come when
[2:09:32] you shall say blessed is he that cometh
[2:09:35] in the name of the Lord
[2:09:36] now I believe this scripture is
[2:09:38] applicable to this age of laodicea for
[2:09:41] Malachi 4 5 says behold God says I will
[2:09:44] send you Elijah the prophet before the
[2:09:48] coming of the great and Dreadful day of
[2:09:49] the Lord ain't that right now now it'll
[2:09:52] be through the ministry of Elijah that
[2:09:55] the son of man would be revealed
[2:09:57] but the people will not see him
[2:10:00] see Christ until they can say blessed is
[2:10:03] he that cometh in the name of the Lord
[2:10:05] why God sent a representative in this
[2:10:08] age
[2:10:11] kiss the Sun
[2:10:14] lest he be angry
[2:10:16] you see I ain't worshiping a man hey we
[2:10:20] don't worship a man
[2:10:22] you say Amen
[2:10:24] that we recognized by saying blessed you
[2:10:28] see that cometh in the name of the Lord
[2:10:30] we recognize we can see Christ in the
[2:10:33] message can you say amen that's right
[2:10:36] and and and and what about each of us
[2:10:39] who are part of God's Ministry today see
[2:10:42] the ministry doesn't stop with brother
[2:10:43] Branham no sir I know there's people
[2:10:45] that's waiting for the return Ministry
[2:10:47] bless your hearts amen and and what what
[2:10:50] else do you do just sit around and wait
[2:10:52] for him to come
[2:10:53] everything that is that brother bran
[2:10:55] wants to do is it's done
[2:10:58] not lays on your hands
[2:10:59] it lays on us can you say amen that's
[2:11:03] exactly right see and so now we we find
[2:11:07] that John 20 21 says Jesus said as my
[2:11:11] father hath sent me so send I you
[2:11:15] oh God doesn't send anyone without a
[2:11:18] commission
[2:11:19] and he says as my father sent me now I'm
[2:11:22] going to send you in the same manner
[2:11:24] ain't that right brother Brown said how
[2:11:26] did the father send him he went with him
[2:11:28] and was in him
[2:11:31] ain't that right he was with him and
[2:11:35] went in it was in him
[2:11:37] that's how the father said to him and
[2:11:39] that's how Christ sends you ain't that
[2:11:41] right at that day you'll know that I'm
[2:11:43] in the father and you in me and I in you
[2:11:47] ain't that right see and there will be
[2:11:50] no guesswork there will be no wondering
[2:11:51] for you shall know
[2:11:57] what a revelation
[2:12:00] is this all right
[2:12:02] so here's give you some scriptures Mark
[2:12:05] 16 15 and he said unto them go ye into
[2:12:07] all the world and preach the gospel to
[2:12:09] Every Creature he that is baptized
[2:12:11] believeth and is baptized shall be saved
[2:12:13] but he that believeth not shall be
[2:12:15] damned do you realize that that that by
[2:12:17] your very words and I don't believe it's
[2:12:20] just the faithful Ministry I believe
[2:12:21] it's I believe it's it's everyone part
[2:12:23] of the ministry of God Amen that he that
[2:12:27] believeth and is baptized by your words
[2:12:29] amen uh uh uh I shall be saved and he
[2:12:34] that believeth not shall be damned and
[2:12:36] notice and these signs shall follow them
[2:12:38] that believe in my name they shall cast
[2:12:40] out Devils they shall speak with new
[2:12:42] tongues they shall take up serpents and
[2:12:43] if they drink any deadly thing it shall
[2:12:45] not hurt them they shall lay hands on
[2:12:47] the sick and they shall recover can you
[2:12:50] say Amen do you realize that you as a
[2:12:53] Believer how many believers do we have
[2:12:55] you can put yourself right in that
[2:12:56] scripture brother Brown was very adamant
[2:12:58] about this scripture belonging in this
[2:13:00] age to the Church of the Living God
[2:13:02] ain't that right John 14 12 verily
[2:13:06] verily Jesus said I say unto you he that
[2:13:08] believeth on me the works that I do
[2:13:10] shall he do also now is there some that
[2:13:12] apply that to brother just being to
[2:13:13] brother Branham that's a lie you go look
[2:13:16] brother Brown never taught it that way
[2:13:18] he said it's the believer
[2:13:20] Jesus was talking to them that believe
[2:13:23] can you say amen he that believeth on me
[2:13:26] the works that I do shall he do also and
[2:13:28] greater than these shall he do because I
[2:13:30] go unto my father and whatsoever you
[2:13:33] shall ask the father in my my name amen
[2:13:36] I will do that the father may be
[2:13:39] glorified in the son if you ask anything
[2:13:41] in my name I will do it and he come in
[2:13:45] his father's name Matthew 18 and 18
[2:13:48] verily verily I or verily I say unto you
[2:13:50] whatsoever you shall bind on Earth shall
[2:13:53] be bound in heaven and whatsoever you
[2:13:54] shall loose on Earth shall be loosed in
[2:13:56] heaven again I say unto you that if two
[2:13:59] of you shall agree on Earth as touching
[2:14:00] anything that they shall ask it shall be
[2:14:03] done for them of My Father which is in
[2:14:06] heaven ain't that right Matthew 21 21
[2:14:09] Jesus answered and said unto them verily
[2:14:11] I say unto you if you have faith and
[2:14:13] doubt not you shall not only do this
[2:14:16] which is done to the Fig Tree but also
[2:14:18] if you shall say to this mountain be
[2:14:19] thou removed and be thou cast into the
[2:14:22] sea it shall be done and all things
[2:14:23] everybody say all things whatever you
[2:14:26] shall ask in prayer believing you shall
[2:14:29] receive you know the heavenly father
[2:14:31] knows exactly what you have need of
[2:14:33] but he asked that you have to ask him
[2:14:35] for it that's where people amen you have
[2:14:38] not because you ask not that's why the
[2:14:41] devil gets us away from prayer so much
[2:14:43] we've groan about it we talk about it we
[2:14:46] complain about it that's not what God
[2:14:48] asked you to do he asked you to ask him
[2:14:50] and brother Brown said ask big
[2:14:54] ask for big things
[2:14:56] don't limit God
[2:14:57] can you say man Luke 10 17 behold I give
[2:15:01] unto you power to tread upon serpents
[2:15:04] and scorpions and over all the power of
[2:15:07] the enemy and nothing shall by any means
[2:15:09] hurt you do you believe that
[2:15:12] he's talking to every representative
[2:15:15] of his
[2:15:17] so God doesn't put you into his ministry
[2:15:19] and give you a commission only to leave
[2:15:21] you helpless
[2:15:22] and you say man and I say to you if
[2:15:24] you're part of the Church of the Living
[2:15:26] God you are part of his ministry
[2:15:29] you're part of his ministry he sent you
[2:15:31] for a work and if you are his agent then
[2:15:34] you have power over the enemy do you
[2:15:37] believe that oh my I'm closing now but
[2:15:41] brother Bram talks about the law of
[2:15:42] inheritance
[2:15:44] and and and it's in the Book of Ruth
[2:15:47] that if any man if a man lost his
[2:15:49] inheritance
[2:15:51] It could only be Redeemed by Kinsmen
[2:15:54] and no one else but a close Kinsman
[2:15:57] could redeem that inheritance and I I
[2:15:59] thought of that and of course he he's
[2:16:02] always applied that to Jesus Christ
[2:16:03] being our Kinsmen Redeemer and all that
[2:16:06] but then then he he he
[2:16:09] says this this this quote that I'm going
[2:16:12] to read you and I thought wow
[2:16:15] and we've read the quote many times
[2:16:18] but after he's saying this that no one
[2:16:21] else but a close Kinsman could redeem
[2:16:23] that inheritance he says now
[2:16:26] let me just drop a little token here
[2:16:29] that I touched on the other night to you
[2:16:31] mothers
[2:16:33] he said how many has prayed for your
[2:16:35] loved ones that are lost all right
[2:16:38] there you are again your
[2:16:41] inheritance
[2:16:44] and you say that with me my inheritance
[2:16:46] he's talking about Kinsmen
[2:16:50] a man that had lost his inheritance
[2:16:53] can you say man
[2:16:55] see now notice how he's putting that he
[2:16:57] says now Paul told the Roman believe on
[2:16:58] the Lord Jesus Christ and thou and thy
[2:17:02] house shall be saved
[2:17:07] man
[2:17:09] I think that's so powerful
[2:17:11] why would God send us put us in the
[2:17:13] message
[2:17:14] just to sit here and cry over Satan just
[2:17:17] mess with our families
[2:17:19] nope
[2:17:21] he's put you in a position of authority
[2:17:26] it's true
[2:17:28] notice believe on the Lord Jesus Christ
[2:17:30] and thou and thy house shall be saved if
[2:17:32] you've got faith enough for yourself to
[2:17:34] be saved have faith enough no matter how
[2:17:37] Wayward that boy is or that girl is
[2:17:39] they'll be saved anyhow
[2:17:41] Kinsmen
[2:17:43] can you say man God somehow if he has to
[2:17:46] lay them on their back laying there in a
[2:17:48] hospital dying they'll be saved I won't
[2:17:50] say to you young people you ought to
[2:17:52] thank God every day to have Christian
[2:17:53] parents that believe this message
[2:17:56] you ought to be thankful to God that
[2:17:58] you've got parents that believe this and
[2:18:00] hold this and will not compromise that
[2:18:02] they have enough faith for themselves in
[2:18:04] this message that they can have faith
[2:18:06] enough for you
[2:18:07] to keep praying for you to believe for
[2:18:09] you
[2:18:11] can you say Amen
[2:18:13] oh yes sir see says if he has to lay
[2:18:16] them on their back laying there in the
[2:18:18] hospital hospital dying they'll be saved
[2:18:20] God promised it it's the inheritance
[2:18:24] The Inheritance and they shall now he
[2:18:27] goes to scripture and they shall be
[2:18:29] there
[2:18:30] said Isaiah and all their offsprings
[2:18:33] with them they shall not hurt nor
[2:18:35] destroy and my Holy Mountain saith the
[2:18:37] Lord can you say man what is he he's
[2:18:41] talking about a mindset
[2:18:44] yeah he was an ambassador representing
[2:18:47] the mindset the attitude the thoughts of
[2:18:49] God
[2:18:51] God put this law of inheritance and now
[2:18:53] he's telling the prophet is telling you
[2:18:55] this is God's law for you this is God's
[2:18:58] law to you that no matter how Wayward
[2:19:00] and how badly they are
[2:19:03] you believe enough for yourself
[2:19:05] believe for them
[2:19:08] keep believing
[2:19:09] keep believing
[2:19:11] you say man it's looking impossible keep
[2:19:12] believing
[2:19:15] amen
[2:19:17] because we represent the power of our
[2:19:19] government now Isaiah 9 6 we all know he
[2:19:23] talks about it but in that one place he
[2:19:25] says the government everybody say the
[2:19:27] government shall be upon his shoulders
[2:19:30] the government
[2:19:33] shall be up on his shoulder
[2:19:35] you realize that's talking to you and I
[2:19:38] that's referring to us the church
[2:19:40] because notice the spoken word is the
[2:19:42] Original Seed 62. the government shall
[2:19:45] be upon his what
[2:19:46] shoulder that's part of his body that's
[2:19:51] his body his shoulders is his body and
[2:19:54] Paul tells us who his body is the church
[2:19:57] which is the fullness of him
[2:20:01] and what we've seen in this age was the
[2:20:04] head the headship
[2:20:06] up in the clouds
[2:20:08] brother Brown said that was the face of
[2:20:09] Jesus Christ that was the head
[2:20:11] coming to what
[2:20:13] his Earthly body
[2:20:17] where is the government on Earth at in
[2:20:19] his body
[2:20:21] Saints shall judge the Earth that right
[2:20:23] Paul said I dare you to go to court with
[2:20:25] one another and not take it before the
[2:20:27] church see Saints shall judge the Earth
[2:20:29] where is the government going to be upon
[2:20:32] he upon his shoulders his body the
[2:20:34] government up on his shoulders that's
[2:20:36] part of the body what is it his Earthly
[2:20:38] strength God's Earthly strength is his
[2:20:41] word made flesh in his body here on
[2:20:44] Earth bringing the past
[2:20:46] can you say Amen do you love him isn't
[2:20:50] he wonderful
[2:20:51] brother and Paul brother Brown said and
[2:20:53] that's where the real Church speaks in
[2:20:56] his power there's where the apostolic
[2:20:58] power returns to the church when the
[2:21:01] government shall be upon his shoulders
[2:21:04] judgment
[2:21:05] and I say we're here
[2:21:09] you have every right and the authority
[2:21:11] to serve notice on the devil
[2:21:14] oh yeah all right amen if the musicians
[2:21:19] will come
[2:21:24] we find that the natural church is
[2:21:26] devoid of the power and life of God
[2:21:30] and
[2:21:32] that's the condition that they're in
[2:21:34] today and brother Branham said the
[2:21:37] church has turned the people over to the
[2:21:39] doctors especially psychiatrists
[2:21:41] how can I prayed about being spiritually
[2:21:43] rich
[2:21:45] or Rich spiritually
[2:21:48] is more than I know
[2:21:50] they are bankrupt
[2:21:52] and don't know it
[2:21:54] but another place he said God sent
[2:21:56] Luther with the word the Lutheran spoke
[2:21:58] for God at that time but they organized
[2:22:00] and again the pure word was lost for
[2:22:02] organization tends toward Dogma Creeds
[2:22:04] and not simple word
[2:22:06] so therefore they can no longer speak
[2:22:07] for God
[2:22:09] sent Wesley and he was the voice with
[2:22:11] the word in his day
[2:22:13] the people who took his Revelation now
[2:22:15] notice took his Revelation from God
[2:22:19] became the living Epistles read and
[2:22:21] known of all men for their generation
[2:22:23] the method has failed God raised up
[2:22:25] others and so it's gone throughout the
[2:22:26] years until in this last day there is
[2:22:29] again another people that's you
[2:22:33] in the land who under their messenger
[2:22:36] now what's happening they're receiving
[2:22:39] the Revelation his Revelation they're
[2:22:41] receiving it
[2:22:42] and under their Messenger will be the
[2:22:44] final voice to the final age
[2:22:47] yes sir the church is no longer the
[2:22:49] mouthpiece of God it is it's it's its
[2:22:51] own mouthpiece so God is turning on her
[2:22:54] he will confound her through the prophet
[2:22:57] and the bride
[2:22:59] then you say man
[2:23:01] for the voice of God will be in her and
[2:23:04] I want to say this you're part of the
[2:23:06] ministry that the prophet brought
[2:23:09] because you have received his revelation
[2:23:11] you haven't received no nothing else you
[2:23:14] don't need the psychologists you don't
[2:23:16] need Dr Dobson and you don't need any of
[2:23:18] these other guys I appreciate him
[2:23:20] they're doing they're doing something
[2:23:22] you know and and doing great things but
[2:23:26] it's not for the bride
[2:23:28] never be ashamed of this message
[2:23:30] never never never never
[2:23:33] I don't I don't care how many people
[2:23:34] turn away
[2:23:37] you young people on the job School
[2:23:39] wherever you're going to be off
[2:23:41] but never never let your don't hide your
[2:23:44] light
[2:23:45] don't be afraid to tell someone God sent
[2:23:47] a prophet
[2:23:48] and tell them where that is I mean we
[2:23:50] ain't Joseph Smith and all that stuff we
[2:23:53] ain't we ain't believing all that
[2:23:54] nonsense we can tell you God told us he
[2:23:57] had sinned a prophet
[2:23:59] he told us and we believe that God sent
[2:24:01] him
[2:24:02] and it was so Vindicated to God this
[2:24:04] isn't just a a a something that's made
[2:24:07] up and it's not something that you just
[2:24:09] believed uh because you're raised in it
[2:24:11] this is something that's been proven to
[2:24:13] you
[2:24:13] God sent a prophet
[2:24:16] God sent a prophet you believe that and
[2:24:19] it's been Vindicated over and over and
[2:24:21] over and over don't be ashamed to tell
[2:24:23] people
[2:24:24] don't hide it
[2:24:27] amen I love the Lord
[2:24:30] greater is he that is in me than he that
[2:24:35] is
[2:24:39] he that is in me
[2:24:43] greater receive
[2:24:47] d
[2:24:48] see that is in me
[2:24:51] than he that is in first verse
[2:24:55] all Satan's like the roaring lion
[2:25:00] home until
[2:25:04] seeking whom he may devour the Bible

[2:33:22] Anne and I know she was certainly
[2:33:25] grateful too
[2:33:28] have everyone and
[2:33:30] even though it was hot
[2:33:32] it was fun and
[2:33:36] been out in that heat all day I was so
[2:33:38] tired that
[2:33:41] I went to bed and
[2:33:43] I actually thought everyone was going to
[2:33:46] bed and Heather went downstairs and
[2:33:47] everybody was in the living room
[2:33:48] enjoying themselves and like I'm going
[2:33:51] to bed
[2:33:52] and I slept great so but it must have
[2:33:56] been that sun that just uh
[2:33:59] tired but anyways we really enjoyed you
[2:34:03] coming and being part of it and having
[2:34:06] you at the house
[2:34:07] and again Jamie it's really good to have
[2:34:10] you and and
[2:34:14] several would be traveling home today
[2:34:16] and so we want to just keep them in our
[2:34:18] prayers they would be traveling and as
[2:34:21] we announced last week that we're only
[2:34:24] having one service today and for
[2:34:28] young people young couples and
[2:34:33] as well we'll be having a Bible study at
[2:34:37] the house about 7 30 tonight we'll be
[2:34:40] doing it around the campfire and so if
[2:34:43] you all want to do that question and
[2:34:45] answers if you've got any questions
[2:34:46] you'd like to ask but we'll try to to
[2:34:49] answer them the best we know how
[2:34:52] and uh we'll also be fixing some food
[2:34:57] for tonight and and just have a
[2:35:00] wonderful time of Fellowship
[2:35:02] and so really looking forward to that
[2:35:04] and got had many uh good reports about
[2:35:08] last Sunday night of of how we had the
[2:35:12] kind of changed up things in the service
[2:35:15] and I really enjoyed it and Lord willing
[2:35:19] we'll try to do that again here soon
[2:35:21] also we're going to be starting next
[2:35:24] Sunday night having more of it you're
[2:35:27] getting youth more involved so you'll
[2:35:30] have different musicians up here
[2:35:33] different song leader and uh
[2:35:37] it's going to be a good time
[2:35:39] and
[2:35:41] anyways looking forward to that as well
[2:35:45] I think our youth are special and to try
[2:35:48] to get them involved as much as we can
[2:35:50] and train them up now and
[2:35:55] as you know you may not be here all the
[2:35:57] time and the Lord could take us home any
[2:36:00] moment but I was listening to brother
[2:36:02] Branham and
[2:36:04] I think it's important that we all would
[2:36:06] go back and listen to that tape taking
[2:36:08] sides with Jesus in 62
[2:36:10] just before in time of evangelism
[2:36:14] and brother Branham really talks about
[2:36:16] our duties as as parents Elders
[2:36:20] everything and that making the way and
[2:36:23] reserving that for our youth and and I
[2:36:26] think that's so important and so uh
[2:36:29] anyways may God bless you and love you
[2:36:32] appreciate you very much and also we
[2:36:36] want to remember brother Joe Greene's
[2:36:39] meeting that is starting this Tuesday
[2:36:42] through Friday and so if you're able to
[2:36:46] I know you'd be blessed brother Andrew
[2:36:48] Glover and brother Ron Spencer will be
[2:36:51] ministering that and and so that meeting
[2:36:54] has snuck up on me and that I sometimes
[2:36:58] tell me that starts this Tuesday as a
[2:37:00] coal mine and so anyways if you're able
[2:37:03] to go I know you'd be blessed and you
[2:37:06] would be a blessing to the church there
[2:37:08] as well
[2:37:10] so we appreciate brother Joe and all
[2:37:13] that he's doing and
[2:37:15] so God bless you let's just bow our
[2:37:17] heads and word of prayer brother Makai
[2:37:20] you want to
[2:37:21] dismiss a prayer
[2:37:27] foreign
