faithful to his soul and I am so glad that we can have that opportunity to acknowledge his faithfulness I believe that God's faithful to The Sinner I believe God is faithful to every human being absolutely in the face of the Earth God is faithful a lot of people don't realize that God is faithful amen but I'm I'm I'm glad amen that we can rest in him knowing that he's got our lives in his hands amen and that he's taken care of us can you say Amen you love the Lord amen amen it's good to be back home we uh had U some good meetings uh there in uh Pennsylvania and uh the brothers uh brother Wayne and brother Andrew brother Ronnie just done an outstanding job in uh just exalting Christ by preaching the message and I think that's the only way you can exalt Christ is just declare the message of the hour and uh what he's brought through us to us in this age and heard you all had a good service here uh Sunday and the Lord just uh moved in Supernatural way and so we're we're thankful for that just her testimonies of God healing and so we we thank the Lord for that and uh it's really good to have the Shamo family sham family brother Dell and his family and I um uh I guess they're more acquainted with my older brother Wendell and uh I guess for a few years now and uh so we have uh seen them at different meetings and things and I didn't know you had a preacher among you and uh until here recently and uh heard brother Ben was preaching then I heard that you got other sons that are preaching the gospels so uh we're thankful for that God is raising up a Young Generation to declare the message of the hour and I believe that as long as God's got a bride on the earth and God's got a Ministry Amen to proclaim the message of the hour and uh it's uh good to have brother Andrew and uh Sister Mariah here with us as well and uh uh we U just looking though for what God has in store for us tonight and I've asked brother Ben to uh uh speak to us and uh we're just believing God to do great things this evening how many's come hungering amen I know uh I I think every believer uh always have something in his heart wanting more of God and I know I am just needing God to move and wanting him to move and uh yesterday was fine but I'm I'm want more of him amen amen and so we want to uh uh just invite brother Ben to come and uh there's a song um is Jesus I really want to see and I had that on my heart today and it's Jesus I really want to see is that your heart's desire to see him it's Jesus I really want to see oh the more I see of this whole world the less it means to me and it's Jesus I really want to see oh sing it now it's Jesus I really want to see oh yes yes yes amen want to take your [Music] of this whole world BL to me it's Jesus I really want to [Music] see and I believe that's uh desire of every believer it's Jesus that we really want to see amen that's why we've gathered ourselves together today I believe is it's him that we want to see we didn't gather together to see any man but we gathered together to see Jesus Christ so we just want to thank the musicians and the singing and the specials they were really good and in fact I'm going to take my keys out of my pocket apparently the car was going off downstairs and you know I I thought it was somebody else you know everybody's asking well whose horns going off and I kept pitchforking the gospel to somebody else and I well found out it was me so if you would we'll just try to enter in and uh read our scripture here real quick from Genesis 1 and one familiar scripture here and we just want to thank brother Shawn and the church here for being so gracious and bearing with us and giving us an opportunity to preach to you we've got some mighty preachers in your midst tonight and feel like I'm one of the smallest ones here so you'll just have to bear with with us and as long as the Lord shows up I think we'll be all right amen so if you will Genesis 1 and verse one familiar scripture here and it says and in the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth and the Earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep and the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters and said and God said let there be light and there was light and God saw the light that it was good and he divided the light from the darkness let's bow our heads dear gracious Heavenly Father Lord we're just coming before you yet once more Lord just asking for another move of God this evening Lord your scripture says that if there's two or three that are gathered together in your name that you will be in their midst and Lord there's more than two or three gathered here tonight Lord there's many needs amongst your Believers tonight and we just ask that you would just take complete control of this service Lord we believe you're the God Almighty Lord that you're in control of everything so Lord we just give you this service Lord I give you my uh body Lord we just ask that you would use it Lord that you would anoint also the hearers that they might be able to receive your word we ask in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen you may be seated again we just want to say how honored we are to be here with you tonight and we just preaching some meetings in July with our brother Andrew and boy he's been a good friend of ours and I've been listening to him and before I was preaching we were listening to him and What a Mighty preacher he is and brother Sean we've known the the Martin family for years and years and we're just very privileged to be here and I don't think my family really needs an introduction I think most of you all know them uh but certainly privileged to be here but if we could from those scriptures we'd like to take a thought on the power of the spoken word the power of a spoken word and what we see in this scripture here is the very first thing that God does when he begins to create things he says in verse three he says let there be light and there was light and I want you to notice something that when God said let there be light there was a power that went forth from God and it became a word brother brandom said that a word is a thought expressed so there was something inside of God that he wanted to express and the only way that God could express the thought that he had in his mind was to Make It Word and when he spoke the very word light light came into manifestation that word light whizzed through all of space it went through all of time it went through all of those things and it picked up Little atoms of light and it created light and that very first word that God uses in the scripture he says let there be light and there was light that one word light has confounded scientists throughout all of history light is something that that that that scientists cannot understand yet today they can't wrap their mind around it one word of God one one thought of God's that has become word created the most uh incredible Paradox if we could explain it in that way but light is something that you cannot see light is something that you can see the results of but you cannot actually see light light travels from one place to another place and it illuminates an object or a place so you can see it you have a receptor so you can uh interact with those things but you can't actually see the light and so many people come to us today and say oh well you can't see God you just got to look around and you can see God God is there he's been there the whole time but the scripture says that God is light we believe that this evening that God is light science can't understand it but we have the Revelation amen one word created the fund fundamental basis for life which is light light is the fundamental basis of light without light life could not exist the trees could not grow your tomato plants would not be able to ripen we would not be able to see all life would be impossible without light amen we believe that in the beginning God created the heavens and the Earth he said let there be light another instance When God Says forth a word is Matthew 14 and Matthew 14: 24-33 says but the ship was now in the midst of a a sea tossed with waves for the wind was contrary and in the Fourth Watch of the night Jesus said unto them walking on the sea went unto them walking on the sea and when the disciples saw him walking on the sea they were troubled saying it is a spirit and they cried out for fear but straight way Jesus spake unto them saying be of good cheer it is I be not afraid and Peter answered unto him Lord if it be thou bid me come unto the W unto you on the water and he said come now I want you to notice that it only took one word from Jesus it only took one word from Jesus a word to a Believer and there was something inside of Peter calling out for more of Jesus he said Jesus if that is you then bid me to come there was a deep calling to the deep inside of Peter and he said Lord if that is you then tell me to come Lord if this is you if this is your word then give me a revelation and when Jesus says that one word it only took one word from the lips of Jesus Christ and he said come it defied all of nature you see cuz Peter stepped out of that boat he stepped out of his comfort zone onto the onto the water am and Peter didn't realize this but when he was taking God at his at his word he was stepping out of the boat he was stepping out of the the laws of nature and into the supernatural he was working inside the supernatural working off of one word of Jesus Christ Hallelujah if we could do that tonight if we could only realize that we have a full manifested word of Jesus Christ here tonight then we can step out of our comfort zones and step onto faith and walk in the way of the supernatural one word of Jesus Christ and we've got a whole Bible full of promises to walk on but what is a word a word is a thought expressed you see a word is also a noun or a verb it can be a noun a person place or thing or it can be a verb which is an action and I want to kind of hone in on this a little bit tonight that we want this word of God it's a living word which a living word means a manifested word a living word means it's not a dead word you see so many people try to keep the word of God as a person place or thing they say this is the scriptures it's a Bible it's a it's it's a thing Jesus Christ is a person and it's all third party but you see we believe a manifested word today because God has come down in this last stage to reveal to us that he doesn't live up in heaven somewhere we don't worship a god that's way up somewhere out you know Untouchable but we worship a god that is living here with us even in us even this evening he is the same yesterday today and forever we can't put God's word on the shelf and call it just a noun but it must be a verb in our lives but I want you to realize something that words are just a Channel all right you see words are great but words on a page can do us no good it's when that thought is made manifest so God has a thought and then he has a word and then he has a manifestation you see so we know that the thought must be made manifest when we see the word amen right are you with me so far amen so when God said let there be light there was the word he had a thought it was always in him the thought of light was always in him but it didn't come to manifestation until after the word was expressed the word must be expressed the word word must be spoken before the manifestation but as soon as the word was spoken let there be light then that molecule of light could come to what it was supposed to be I want to show you how there are power in words words are very powerful things now this is a subject that I I didn't preach on for a long time because everybody's like oh you got to be careful what you say you know words are powerful I that's boring stuff you know I didn't want want to preach on it for a long time until God revealed to me the actual power that words carry and how it applied to me you see because it's so easy to put this out on somebody else to say this word is for somebody else that this message was for the prophet the third poll was for the prophet the spoken word is for somebody else the spoken word is for the preachers the spoken word is for the song leaders the spoken word is for the pastors and we Pitchfork it onto somebody else and we don't take on the responsibility of our position if I could just tell it to you like this you have a position in Jesus Christ why does Satan get so mad at you what have you ever done to the devil to make him mad but I want you to realize that you hold a position as the Bride of Jesus Christ now I'm talking about Holy Ghost filled Christians now you hold a position in Jesus Christ that the devil has been after for 6,000 years and be the devil has wanted to be made equal with God since heaven and he's been clawing fighting trying to gain a position where he would be equal with God or Jesus Christ and then here you come in in the 11th hour and you are brought in to be the bride you are made partakers with Jesus Christ through him we are now one with Jesus Christ he has spoken the word for a bride to come forth and here we are in the manifestation you now hold a position in Jesus Christ that Satan has wanted for thousands of years and yet you hold that position Hallelujah so if you hold a position then you are now higher than Satan's position it doesn't matter if you're the skin on the bottom of the body of Jesus Christ you're if you're the skin on the bottom of Jesus Christ's foot if you're the skin on the bottom of the foot then your job is to stomp on the head of the enemy the hand can't do the job but the foot has to do the job brother Andrew of stomping on the heads of the enemy praise the Lord he has a word for our hour and someone is going to manifest manifest that word and if someone is going to manifest that word then I believe it's going to be the message our Believers and I believe it's going to be the message believer that is here tonight we can manifest the very word of God that's been spoken about since the beginning that's right if we could catch it praise the Lord I think I ate the mic but I want to show you the power of words using negative words now this is this is science here telling us this I didn't just make this up using negative words such as I can't or I won't right it increases stress hormones such as cortisol which slows down metabolism increasing inflammation over over time science says that those phrases are so powerful they are toxic to your physical body this is not something I just made up this is science telling us this that's right that what we speak out of our own mouths is so powerful that it can have an impact on our physical body so many people want to say oh sticks and stones may break my bones but words will never hurt me no no no no that's not truth on that psychology that you're making up just to make yourself feel better but that's not the truth true but positive words such as I can I will I love I'm happy it increases energy in the frontal lobe of your brain increasing creativity purpose Etc so the words that we speak out of our mouths carry so much power that it can affect even our physical bodies believe and there's nothing new Under the Sun Proverbs 18 uh 21 says death and life are in the power of the tongue and they that love it shall eat the fruit thereof you see that truth had been laying there in the scriptures this entire time but scientist just now trying to figure out wow these words actually have some some power we've known the word has power because there was a word that went forth in the beginning that said let there be light and we are still seeing the manifestation you see God's thoughts of the Believers are Eternal thoughts and when God said let there be light that light is still shining to this day and his thoughts of you are no different he had a thought of you in the beginning and we've had a word come down in our age and it said he is calling out a bride and when that message comes forth and says Bride come up a little higher there is going to be a molecule somewhere there's going to be a molecule named Andrew that's going to rise up and say Lord that's me I'm going to respond to that word there's going to be a little molecule named Ben shaml out somewhere floating around that's going to respond to the word of Jesus Christ and say that word is me I am the word and he is me everything that God was he poured into Jesus Christ and everything that Jesus Christ is he poured into the church so God and His word are the same you and the word are the same you are the manifestation of what the word is talking about so when the message comes and says I will have Overcomers hello when the word says I will have Overcomers then there must be somebody to respond that will overcome but we're not going to overcome without a battle all right we know that amen so don't be surprised the next time you go through a battle but when you're going through a battle we have a promise there's a word that's already been spoken that must come to fulfillment amen but a word is a thought expressed scripture says as a man thinketh in his heart so is he sir second Corinthians 10:3 says for we walk though we walk in the flesh we do not war after the flesh for the weapons of our Warfare are not carnal But Mighty through God to the pulling down of strongholds you see what we've done as human beings is we've let Satan so influence us we hear it all the time people come and complain and say oh the the devil's been telling me this oh the devil's been telling me that well if you know it's the devil telling you something why are we listening to it but he comes and says oh this person across the Pew brother sister you know they just don't like you did you see how they looked at you the other day brother Andrew you were preaching your heart out and they just didn't raise their hand and say Amen oh my and we let him build complexes within us we're we're allowing him to build strongholds inside of us but we have a word amen verse 5 says casting down imaginations you see so many of those strongholds that are built up in a church you see a lot of them are just imaginations none of them are actual problems but it's what people think of a situation you say oh that person doesn't like me well you have you talked to him and asked him oh this person looked at me funny or this you know they they they they build up this situation so much in their minds that they build a rift or or or a wedge between you and another believer when it may or may not exist that way but casting down imaginations and every High thing that exalts itself against the knowledge of God and bringing into captivity every thought into The Obedience of Jesus Christ amen we see so many people build up complexes about themselves how they look or or or or what have you what other people think about you or and we see it drive people away from church all the time it's a stronghold that Satan is trying to build up to get you distracted brother Bram came and and told us the story of the eagle and the chicken he said that a farmer came and stole that chicken egg out of that nest and raised it by a hen and it grows up and they're like here peck on this a little while peck on this a little while peck on this a little while and just something didn't seem right to that little Eagle do you know why because he was an eagle from the beginning he never was a chicken he was eating on the chicken's food as much as he could but it wasn't doing him any good he said there was something higher for that eagle but you see those chickens will try to keep you a chicken you know why because eagles eat chickens so as long as you're dwelling with the chickens those chickens don't want you to know that you're an eagle because as soon as you notice hey you know what I'm built a little bit different I can stand up on that post and Mama Eagle says jump Mama Eagle says come up a little higher then you have the ability that the chickens don't have oh the devil's Devil's trying to beat up the message believer especially the young people man he's trying to tell them you don't you're not worth anything you don't amount to anything this message isn't for you this message is too hard the the youth group that I grew up with when I was young I don't know if there's hardly any aside from my family and and related family that's still in the message even because Satan is coming against the young people but my scripture says that God will not lose a one we have a word you see people have a hard time understanding predestination but there is something that holds you there is something that'll hold you through the hard times there's something that'll pick you up when you're down on the ground there's some there's there's an arm that is long enough that will pick you up out of the myy clay so we have weapons to our Warfare yes but the world is telling us to look at what we tell ourselves or or what other people think about us but brother brandom came and told us it doesn't matter what other people think about you it doesn't matter what you think of yourself you see that psychology what matters is what God has said about you if we could only catch that it it only matters it doesn't matter what your past is you've never gone too far there's only one unforgivable sin brother Bram said but it doesn't matter what you've done God's arm is long enough sir oh but you don't understand what I've been going through I can't receive my healing because of this or that you see that's a stronghold come on and this word has come forth tonight to free you from that stronghold you don't need screaming and shouting to be released from a stronghold you know there was a time where Paul and Silas were in prison one night and at midnight they started to sing songs they weren't screaming and they weren't shouting but they were just singing good old gospel songs at midnight it's a dark dungeon it's wet down there it's cold down there it's dark down there and they were bound with the enemy's chains you see I want you to notice they were not bound by chains of Paul and Silas but they were Bound by the Romans chains come on you see if those chains were Paul and silas's chains then it would be their responsibility to pick up those chains and carry them to work it would be their responsibility to pick up those chains and carry them to school it'd be their responsibility to pick up those chains and carry them to church but you see those chains were not Paul and silas's chains those chains belonged to the jail so when Satan's coming against you and saying you are bound by depression you are bound by this or that you know whatever your problem is and he's saying you're just Bound by this you're bound by a complex that complex is not your complex you can let go of it because Jesus Christ has come and he has shaken those he has shaken your shackles loose and those chains do not belong to you they are not yours they belong to the devil and you can leave them with him because we have a victory to win tonight something to be free from brother I liked what you said the other day about feeling the sound but we had a word go forth and when that word when you and the word become one I'm going to get ahead of myself but when you and the word become one sir what comes out of your mortal lips these ones right here everybody could reach up and touch the lips what comes out of these when you are a holy ghost filled believer what comes out of these lips are not your words but they are Jesus Christ's own words Hallelujah Lord man if my name was Andrew I'd be jumping all over the place man but when you're a holy ghost filled believer and your life lines up with the scripture and you claim that healing with these lips that is Jesus Christ brother ROM said speaking through your lips and that devil has no right to you in fact that devil is cast out by the name of Jesus Christ if he was standing here in the literal Corporal body he could do no more for you than when it comes across your lips and you can claim the same promises today it doesn't have to be brother brandom 60 you know 70 years ago it doesn't have to be Jesus 2,000 years ago but it can be you yourself standing here tonight and you claim the promise of Jesus Christ and when you speak the word that word goes all the way back to before the beginning it was a thought of God he wanted you free he wanted you to hear this message he wanted you to be free and when you speak those words it goes all the way back to a thought that Jesus Christ had before the beginning of the world that you are now responding to brother brandham said if he G if God Gave You ears it didn't matter if you were deaf God wanted you to hear amen he said claim the promise in the name of Jesus [Music] Christ but it is God's word living through flesh Woo You See Jesus had perfect Faith because he had a perfect revelation of who he was in the word Jesus knew who he was he could look at this Bible and say this is who I am if we could only catch that tonight when we can look in the Book of Revelation he starts talking about a bride of Jesus Christ yeah spotless sinless BL bride of Jesus Christ right and we can identify with that and say that is me amen that is me then what's going to stand in your way then all right brother brandham says in blind bmus he says has anybody ever seen this picture of the light the angel yes he says the angel of the Lord the pillar of fire see they've got it scientist is got it Washington's got it yeah but listen to what he says here he says now the church has got it in reality this church has that light not just in a picture on the wall not just up in in Jeffersonville not just up in Washington DC but we have the living reality of Jesus Christ Living inside our flesh when we are a son and daughter of God and many times miss it because it's hide behind a veil of Flesh which is which is the same type that God has used throughout all ages and we can't see that it's God because it looks like brother Shawn it looks like brother Andrew it looks like Ben sham looks like brother Dan it looks like and we can't see that it's Jesus Christ himself living in flesh in this last age and he already spoke the word let there be light and there was light and it is still manifesting itself here today oh I was listening to a tape on Revelations 4 today and you know one of the ministers in brother bram's church he had a hard time seeing is God on his throne and if he's not on his throne then where is he yeah and brother Bram says we're going to get to that here in a minute then maybe 30 minutes afterwards he goes see it's God in his people there you go brother there he is you see God's not up in heaven somewhere floating around on a cloud unreachable and when we pray you know it's just throwing hopes and dreams up to the air hoping something will happen you see so many people these days they pray like they're buying a lottery ticket you know put me down for five of these or however it works I don't know hoping that when their number is called it just happens to line up boom there's a miracle for me that's not how it works you see we believe in a living God it's not just hope or dreams but this is a living reality this is a Living Word you want to know what a living word it is look around the room this is the Living Word of God for this age we have a position that we have to come into I believe she's close we're about ready to take a a Rapture here pretty Qui quick you see it's the same light scripture says that God is light so when he said let there be light yes it was more than just creating the sun it was more than just creating the Stars you see those two things alone you know scientists can't even understand it they don't even know if if light dwells in time yet if you can't even understand that then our God is pretty good our our God is pretty big our God is pretty creative and you know what that little sickness that you got that's a little dot inside of your body but we're a little dot in Virginia and Virginia is a little dot on this globe and this globe's a little dot in the Galaxy you see we we serve a big God we serve a great big God and your problem is so small but our God is so loving that he's not out in some other galaxy somewhere but he is living inside of you and when you say to this mountain be thou removed then you better expect that mountain to be moving woo wow you see Lord there was two Believers one time went to go spy out the land of Canaan and they met a woman named Rahab and I always thought this this story was so incredible because they go to meet Rahab and they say you just hang the Scarlet thread from your window now I I want you to be put in the position of the two spies because so many times we're put in the we know the types of of Rahab but I want you to put yourself in the position of these two spies now but they say put this Scarlet thread out your window and you and your family will be saved what Authority did they they have to say that you know they didn't brother Andrew they didn't go buy a a steel demo saw and after they said that get to think about it and going you know what her house is actually in the gates of Jericho and they actually run chariot races on those on those walls those are pretty thick walls how are those walls going to collapse and her section of that wall is just going to be saved they didn't go buy a demo saw and go we better make you know we better do something ourselves go cut a a control joint around her house no that would have been putting it on their own works on but they were commissioned by God they were in the line of duty and when they said that you and your house will be saved when you display the token all of the authority of not only Israel was behind them but all of the authority of heaven was behind them and that was just a conversation that they were having hiding in their in this in a harlot's house yeah all right but when the when the words came off of their lips the two spies when it came off their lips it was as good as God saying it himself it doesn't matter I I mean it goes it begins to crack and it goes somehow some way her house was laid their standing because they were ambassadors from on high you see if our country sends ambassadors somewhere then they are given full authority to make decisions right they say you can negotiate this deal we've got a deal we we if you're in the line of duty you make the deal report back to us they don't have to go and start negotiating and call up the president hey the deal's changed a little bit are you okay with this yeah okay all all right go negotiate a little bit more hey something changed no but they are in the line of duty they have full Authority they are ambassadors of that country and if we could realize that we are ambassadors we are God sent ambassadors to this world today the true Holy Ghost Christians now all right you are an ambassador of Jesus Christ Living on the Earth today so all of the power that God poured into Jesus he poured into his church are we the Church of the Living God then you have the power you hold the authority to speak the word and it will happen for if you say unto this mountain that's right all right be thou removed and cast into the sea now it doesn't say If you think but you see if God never spoke the word then he would be dwelling with his thoughts alone yeah right but those thoughts had to come to manifestation and words were simply a conduit for the thought to become a manifestation so if we can look back and see ourselves in the scripture then to me that's 100% amen because it's a thought of God yes being in the written word the spoken word amen I must be the manifestation I have to now the devil can't talk me out of it because I've already seen it it's a revelation now Lord doesn't matter what Satan says now but you see there's victory in words Revelations 12:11 says and they overcame him by the blood of the lamb and the what and the word of their testimony you see it's important what you say it's important what you say to other people it's important that you tell your testimony so many people get ashamed of their testimony and won't tell it no it is important to tell your testimony I know demons that have been cast out by testimony but there's victory in words you know there's one time Joshua comes upon a battle and he wanted to destroy every enemy yeah we know the story real well and the sun became his enemy because the Sun starts to go down yeah and a son of God in the line of duty look looks up at the Sun and says son stand still son stands how silly is that yeah in the human eyes that just seems outrageous but when the Son of God looks up and says son stand still I'm in the line of duty there is something hindering me from doing my work I am an ambassador of Jesus Christ so I have a commission and I must fulfill it so I'm going to speak the word for my situation and it will happen even if that means the entire universe is going to pause if it's got to pause for me to do my work then it'll pause because I'm going to speak the word so you just got to take your situation tonight you Sons and Daughters of God it's time that we take responsibility for our position and start to speak the word because this position doesn't come without responsibility there will be those that are sick in the church there will be those that are bound with chains in the church and it is our responsibility as Believers to help them along the way it is our responsibility to pray for the sick it's our responsibility to preach the gospel it's our responsibility to help the needy but there's great victory in words you see so many people are trying to take the words for this age okay because we had a word for this age this word isn't for some other age but this word is for this age that there will be a bride and she will manifest herself and there will be a Rapture we're getting we're getting so close you see everything that's lining up there will be a bride in this last agage but they try to take the victory out of those words and just put it up in Jeffersonville and say oh it's it only lays on those tapes brother you see that Victory brother Andrew it's only for those tapes spoken word is only for them tapes over there on they're making the gospel of none effect that's right exactly they're taking all of the Victory and putting it back 70 years ago 60 70 years go when it has no place in the past but the victory of the word belongs in the church today the victory of the word belongs in your body tonight we're talking about True Believers here because my scripture say in Hebrews 138 it says God is the same yesterday today and forever God never changes so when he says let there be light there must be light until he says otherwise that light is going to keep on Shining he doesn't have to come back and and and say oh oh no this is an updated message Now That We Believe come on there's an eighth messenger now that we believe no you don't have to add anything to it once the word is spoken that's [Music] it but the TR Devil's trying to get you only to listen to tapes instead of preaching the word because the devil knows that your words carry power amen he's stripping you of the power out of your life now we believe in tapes we listen to tapes amen we believe that's the spoken revealed word amen praise the Lord amen but the world has been groaning waiting on the manifestation of the sons of God you see I don't believe that God came and sent his holy ghost for six and a half Church ages I don't believe God would Short Change us like that but I believe the Holy Spirit has been sent for a full seven Church ages until we get caught up in that Rapture boy I believe the holy spirit is here to heal it's here to save it's here to set free amen you know what and and and maybe I'll just bring it to a close here pretty quick but the holy spirit is here there's more than two or three Believers the holy spirit is here and maybe we can't see him in the physical like brother brandom saw him in the physical because he is like light he can be around us and we only see the effects of him right amen Pastor cumi was telling me a testimony of of a a sister over in Africa when we were preaching for him earlier this year he said the sister had an ulcer a cancer something and it was eating her up and um they were going to have to do surgery on her and after they did the surgery of course she couldn't have children and and all of those things but he said under the preaching of the word at those meetings you see I never met this woman I never saw her there's like 5 th000 people in this church huge churches over there but he said under the preaching of the word she went back to the doctor said I need to get this x-ray got it x-ray couldn't find the tumor anywhere couldn't find the ulcer anywhere he goes but I did find something it was a baby he found a baby inside of her when science said there's no way that's nothing I can do we can preach all we want but if God doesn't come down and show himself real then it's all for nothing but we believe that Jesus Christ is here because the same atmosphere that was over there that night is here tonight we believe the same God that was over there that night is here tonight all we need to do is reach up and say Lord let there be light in my life may I accept the word for my age may I come to manifestation because there's a deep calling out to the deep and there is a deep that will respond am whatever your situation is whatever the healing is that you need whatever those shackles are it's time that we let loose and we we we just continue right into freedom because Freedom Is Ours Victory Is Ours let those let those walls fall but our word will stay true because we're standing with the word of Jesus Christ if we could just stand and the the musicians come I'll try to wrap it up here now it's a Wednesday night I don't want to keep you along Jesus had a third pole Ministry brother brandom had a third pole Ministry and I believe we are a part of the third pole Ministry amen amen yes sir we are a part of the spoken word you know why because you're the manifestation you are the manifestation of the spoken word we're in the age of the spoken word we believe that first John 1:14 says and the Word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us am yes see so many times we're looking for some great big lightning bolt to strike us to receive our healing or to receive our need or except that it was the Lord's word for us when we don't need any of that it's just like light let let the manifestation come forth It's Faith just reach up and grab a hold of it don't ever let it go amen because it's just as real it's more real than us standing here tonight brother brandom says the sun would shine on some dirt and this the uh dirt would say oh this sun is too hot The Rock would say oh this old sun is so hot but that little seed said that's what I'm looking [Music] for and it began to Spring forth to life it quickened that part of the dirt because the sun was sent not to Quicken The Rock not to Quicken the dirt but it was quickened to give life to the [Music] seed the scripture says that to them that believe this word it will Quicken your mortal bodies and then we had a word come in our age and he said not will be quickened but is quickened right now you see you used to be an coholic you used to be a drug addict but you're not anymore what happened the word has quickened you you might be sick tonight you might be in shackles tonight I don't know what your need is but there's a quickening power that's here and he is here I believe that so all you have to do is reach up and say Lord I am ready to take on the manifestation there's a word that's already gone forth there's a a message that's gone forth for our age it's already been spoken so if the word has already been spoken then manifestation must follow there's no question about it let's just bow our heads dear gracious Heavenly Father Lord we just we just thank you for your presence that's here tonight Lord Lord we just ask that you would take this simple thought Lord and Quicken it to our hearts Lord may we be able to just reach up and say Lord this this is my word this is my position whatever the need is Lord that's amongst your people Lord we just ask that you would walk each every aisle Lord touch each and every heart Lord we believe that you're a big God you're a great God you can see each and every need Lord but yet you're so personable that you'll meet with every single one of us here tonight so Lord we just ask that you would come down and that you would just cradle us in your arms of mercy and Grace tonight look upon our needs father those that need healing Lord we just ask that you would give them healing because we believe that you're the same yesterday today and forever Lord if you've healed one time and we go according to your word you're obligated by your own word to do it again Lord your word has gone forth we just ask that you would just brood amongst your people if there's any backsliding Lord just bring them closer to you father each of us have needs father we just ask that you would be with them we thank you for it in the name of Jesus Christ [Music] amen I'll turn it back over to brother Sean is [Music] hereen he he is here holy holy I will bless his name again he is here listen closely hear him calling out he is here you can touch you will never oh can we just

made us in a way to where we can not reing in ourselves our own ideas our thoughts but when that word flows through us and we begin to speak it's begin it's it's just as though God is speaking Hallelujah and I'm so glad for that and Devil's tremble amen when this bride speaks the word of God do you believe that hallelujah hallelujah well I love the Lord let's just sing that little song Can't You See why I'm happy oh can't you see why I'm happy oh I've accepted the word word of the Lord the reveal work that was spoken by the prophet of aren't you glad for it oh sing it again oh can't

the word for this age and I'm thankful for that I'm glad that again that God is raising these young men amen that ain't questioning the message and trying to dilute it but just preach it the way it it was spoken amen for we know the angel of the Lord accompanies the message always it ain't for up to us to figure it all out and Who's Who and all that but we're just obligated to preach the light of the age that God has sent to us amen and I'm so glad for that and uh we want to just keep the shaml family in our prayer as they be traveling and uh here y'all going to be on vacation for a couple weeks or so so we want to keep them in our prayer that the Lord just keep them safe wherever they go amen and uh you can have your seats for just a moment um uh but just to let you know uh everyone's invited we've got uh some food there at uh the Holiday Inn Express there in blackburg right off of prices fork and um so if you want to uh to go there and have some fellowship and uh eat amen uh you're more than welcome to do that and uh look look for that and uh but I had announced a few days ago uh that uh brother Andrew and sister Mariah um are going to be moving to Arkansas and uh brother Andrew had come to me and um uh you know just told me his heart that the Lord had uh spoke directly to him and uh that it was time for a move in his life location and uh and so uh this is going to be their last service with us for for a little while not forever but for a little while and uh brother Andrew has got a a full schedule and uh and so uh but as soon as he gets freed up uh we we're going to have have him to come back and and speak to us and preach for us and and I I certainly love brother Andrew and sister Mariah very much and um uh he's been a well they've been a real friend uh real help and [Music] uh anyway I'm going to have brother Andrew come to speak to you praise the Lord Lord God bless you amen God bless you all amen enjoyed that word tonight by brother Ben amen uh sure appreciate the the message tonight and amen how many's thankful for the word of faith amen that's been given to us in this hour and from our hearts and amen we want to say God bless you all tonight and thank you brother Shawn for this opportunity tonight to share our heart concerning this transition and our journey of Faith um the Lord brought us here a little over four years ago uh to Faith Tabernacle and to put our shoulder to the will and to work under the burden and the vision here with brother Shawn and the the ministry here and it has been a a real honor brother sea to be here and to be a part of the church and thank you for your stand for this message and everything that you all stand for and we appreciate the vision here for the message of the hour and I just tonight I I know brother Sean has announced it and I just wanted to take this opportunity to share my heart with you all um we know in Romans 8:14 the Bible tells us as many as are led by the spirit of God they are the sons of God and we know that anytime that God would call a man to do something or lead a man somewhere or uh to follow his will for their life there can be a maybe some confusion or misunderstandings and I believe the only way that we can avoid those is just to sh our heart and I want to say that brother Sean ministered here a couple weeks ago on a Sunday morning I believe on resting in the will of God for our lives and I tell you if there ever was a sermon directly spoken to my heart that sermon was directly spoken to me brother Sean um because no matter how confident we are of the will of God the vision of God for our lives there's always that side of the humanity that struggles but I want to say I think of how that Abraham in the Bible uh the Lord would move him from time to time and think of Elijah how that God would move him from cherith to zarap paath and think of brother brandom our prophet in this day who was moved uh to follow the will of God for his life and we see that even those transitions have uh come into many of our Lives as we've had to follow the will of God in very difficult times but I just want to say that even I was just thinking today of how that uh maybe we think of our brother bcll there who had to leave everything and move to a different place to do what the lord lord had for him or you think of these men of God I know brother sha before has had these transitions I think of uh brother Donnie I know brother Terry brother Amos has heard this many times I've heard it as a kid often wondering how that God would show a man the will of God for his life to leave there in Kentucky and move to Tennessee and we know the Lord gives us Transitions and times but I just want to if it's okay to share a quote that God has just given to me during this time that's been a real strength to me it's in the power of transformation brother Bram says sometimes you have to separate from everything that's dear on Earth to you to take your position that God has called you to he said I'm sure you can read between the lines what I'm saying see sometimes the very dearest person on Earth you have to shake hands with them and take your position in Christ to where God is called you see but what is God doing transforming you from what you was maybe a daughter or a son whatever it is from a lovely family sometimes he places you somewhere else because it's his way of doing it see by the renewing of your mind to obey the word of God regardless of what the price is and so tonight I just want to share with you from my heart the Lord spoke to her heart there in February and showed us that he was moving us to Arkansas to be there with brother Matt Morris in the church there at Grace Tabernacle and as always as brother Shawn was even speaking the humanity side is very very hard sometimes when you don't quite understand everything but sometimes we have to forsake all to follow the lord and I want to say that that's uh what we're doing is to follow the will of the Lord amen there's no issues or no problems or situations just following the will of God and though we don't understand all the time that's what's on our heart to do is to serve him and I want to say that U brother Sean we thank you amen of course for this opportunity to say that I believe we're still one body I believe we'll still be a part of the body and as brother Sean said we'll be coming through to visit as the Lord and brother sea would allow us to and I think of how brother brandham says that we're all sheep of one pasture amen though we may be serving God different areas different locations we're all sheep of one pasture and I just want to take this moment maybe to just say this I want to thank you all for all the love and support I want to thank you for all the prayers the many times we've been gone and been gone for weeks and sometimes a month or two at a time and to have the consolation that this assembly was praying for us and amen to be able to listen to brother Shawn on the way to church and hear the song leaders say they were praying for us and amen to hear Brother Sean say he was praying for us that means the world to us amen all the support I want to also take this time and I pray y all just give me a moment I don't want to um get uh I want to say this I want to thank you for all the support you've given us in prayer as well as the financial support um I think of when the lord gave us our little son Malachi and brother Shawn uh so graciously in the church here um helped us during that time to be able to stay home and to be here and you know uh as brother Shawn said when he did that he wanted to be a blessing to us and I want to thank you brother Shawn for that and I want to thank this church for all their love to my wife the times I've been gone Amen to Malachi amen all the food that you brought to us when Malachi was born there's so many things I could start listing I just want to say this thank you from the bottom of our hearts I want to say thank you uh to every member here of the church I want to say I love you all with the love of the lord we appreciate you with all of our hearts and amen I just want to say this to brother Sean he's been a mentor to me he's been a friend he's been an influence to me in my life beyond just preaching Beyond just the ministry but just in his everyday life and things I've seen him do things I've the way I've seen him handle situations he's been an influence to me and as I was just speaking there Sunday um to the church in Pennsylvania of how that the Lord will raise up young people and how that instead of maybe pushing them aside during their immaturities we ought to cultivate the gifts and I want to say from the bottom of my heart that brother Shawn was one of those men that did that for me uh he believed in me when others did opened his door to me his pull pit to me allowed me to be a part of the meetings here for many years brother Sean I want to say thank you I love you with all my heart I appreciate your stand for this message I appreciate your family this family's been more than just a pastor and his wife and kids but they've been like family to us and we sure loving each and every one of them I want to say I believe that God has great things in store for all of us I want to say this from the bottom of my heart that we love you all and we appreciate you with all of our hearts and you all pray for us and we'll be praying for you and as brother Sean said this is not the last time you'll be seeing us we'll be coming back through Lord willing as God allows and I just want to take this time once again to say thank you if there's anything I could say from from my heart to Faith Tabernacle from Mariah malach we say thank you all and we love you the love of the Lord amen and I believe any day now we're going to step from this realm of time into eternity and there will be gathered together forever and there'll be no more separation but if I could say anything to you tonight I say this press the battle amen I pray this church will get behind and support brother sea like never before I pray that we'll just continue to fight the devils and win the victories together amen and if we can do anything to be a blessing to your help we want to say we're here but we sure love you all with all of our hearts and brother Sean
