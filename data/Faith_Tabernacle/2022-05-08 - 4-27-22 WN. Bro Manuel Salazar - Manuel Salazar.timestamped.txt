[7:11] and elijah the tishbite who was of the
[7:14] inhabitants of gilead said unto ahab
[7:17] as the lord god of israel liveth before
[7:21] whom i stand there shall not be dew nor
[7:24] rain these years but according to what
[7:29] to my word
[7:32] and the word of the lord came unto him
[7:34] saying
[7:35] get the hands and turn the eastward and
[7:37] hide thyself by the brook cherith that
[7:39] is before jordan and it shall be that
[7:42] thou shalt drink of the brook and i have
[7:44] commanded the ravens to feed thee there
[7:47] so he went and did according unto the
[7:49] word of the lord for he went and dwelt
[7:51] by the brook cherith that is before
[7:53] jordan
[7:54] and the ravens brought him bread and
[7:57] flesh in the morning and bread and flesh
[7:59] in the evening and he drank of the brook
[8:02] and it came to pass after a while that
[8:04] the brook dried up because there had
[8:06] been no rain in the land
[8:08] and the word of the lord came unto him
[8:12] saying arise get thee to zeropath which
[8:15] belongs to belongeth to zydon
[8:18] and and dwell there be behold i have
[8:21] commanded a widow woman there to sustain
[8:24] thee
[8:25] so he arose and went to zarepath and
[8:28] went and when he came to the gate of the
[8:30] city behold the widow woman was there
[8:33] gathering of sticks and he called her
[8:35] and said fetch me i pray thee a little
[8:37] water in a vessel that i may drink and
[8:40] she was going to fetch it
[8:42] he called to her and said bring me i
[8:44] pray thee a morsel of bread in thy hand
[8:47] and she said as the lord thy god liveth
[8:50] i have not a cake i have not a cake but
[8:52] a handful of meal in a barrel and a
[8:55] little oil in a cruise and behold i'm
[8:57] gathering two sticks that i may go in
[8:59] and dress it for me and my son that we
[9:02] may eat it and die
[9:04] and elijah said unto her fear not go and
[9:08] do as thou has said but make me thereof
[9:11] a little cake what
[9:14] what
[9:15] somebody say first
[9:18] hallelujah
[9:20] and bring it unto me and after make for
[9:23] thee and for thy son

[9:36] upon the earth

[11:44] chapter four
[11:49] brother sean said that we had not to

[11:53] time this evening
[11:58] the book of luke chapter 4 you love
[12:00] reading the word of god
[12:02] how many really love reading the word of
[12:04] god
[12:05] are you just saying harry hear me out
[12:06] brother and start preaching
[12:09] so we're going to read the word of god
[12:11] tonight
[12:12] luke chapter 4
[12:15] and let's start at verse 16.
[12:20] and the bible says and he came to
[12:22] nazareth where he had been brought up
[12:25] and as his custom was he went into the
[12:28] synagogue on the sabbath day
[12:30] and stood up for
[12:32] to read
[12:34] and there was delivered unto him the
[12:36] book of the prophet isaiah
[12:39] and when he had opened the book he found
[12:41] the place where it was written
[12:44] the spirit of the lord is upon me
[12:48] because he hath anointed me to preach
[12:51] the gospel to the poor
[12:54] he has sent me to heal the brokenhearted
[12:59] to preach deliverance to the captives
[13:03] and recovering of sight to the blind
[13:06] to set at liberty to them that are
[13:09] bruised
[13:11] to preach the acceptable year of the
[13:14] lord
[13:15] can somebody say acceptable
[13:19] and he closed the book and he gave it
[13:21] again to the minister and sat down and
[13:24] the eyes of them that were in the
[13:26] synagogue were fastened on him
[13:30] and he began to say unto them this day
[13:34] is this scripture fulfilled in your ears
[13:40] and all bear him witness
[13:43] and wandered at the gracious somebody
[13:46] said gracious and the gracious words
[13:49] which proceeded
[13:50] out of his mouth
[13:53] and just for my brother tonight i took
[13:55] the liberty
[13:57] to make the definition of gracious for
[13:59] you for brother reuben that word
[14:02] gracious means joy
[14:05] the word gracious means pleasure
[14:08] the word gracious means to delight
[14:12] it means charm it means loveliness good
[14:15] will and kindness no doubt when god
[14:17] speaks it's gracious words that go out
[14:21] [Applause]
[14:24] hallelujah
[14:26] and all that bear witness and wonder
[14:28] that the gracious words which proceeded
[14:31] out of his mouth
[14:34] and they said
[14:36] is not this joseph's son
[14:42] wait a minute those are good words
[14:43] that's good preaching
[14:48] isn't that joseph's son don't we we know
[14:50] him
[14:51] that's just a man
[14:56] [Music]
[14:57] isn't that a little bit like today
[15:00] they hear the gracious words
[15:04] they're good words
[15:08] and then they stand back and say isn't
[15:09] that just a man
[15:18] and he said unto them ye will surely say
[15:20] unto me
[15:22] this proverb physician heal thyself
[15:24] whatsoever we have heard done in
[15:26] capernaum do also here in thy country
[15:30] and he said verily i say unto you no
[15:34] prophet is accepted in his own country
[15:38] but i tell you of a truth
[15:41] many widows were in israel in the days
[15:44] of elias
[15:45] when the heaven was shut up three years
[15:47] and six months when the great famine
[15:50] somebody say famine was throughout all
[15:53] the land but unto none of them was
[15:56] elijah said
[15:58] save unto sarah pat
[16:01] a city of zion unto a woman that was a
[16:04] widow
[16:05] and many lepers were in israel in the
[16:08] time of elisha the prophet and none of
[16:11] them was cleansed saving naaman the
[16:13] syrian
[16:15] and all they that are in the synagogue
[16:16] when they heard these words they were
[16:19] filled with happiness
[16:25] they heard these words and they were
[16:27] filled with love
[16:30] they heard the gracious word and they
[16:32] were filled with joy
[16:38] [Music]
[16:40] and all they in the synagogue when they
[16:42] heard these things they were filled with
[16:44] wrath
[16:46] and rose up and thrust him out of the
[16:49] city and led him unto the brow of the
[16:51] hill where on their city was built but
[16:54] they might cast him down headlong but he
[16:57] passing through the midst of them went
[16:59] his way
[17:01] can we say amen to the reading of the
[17:03] word
[17:05] now i started off this evening by saying
[17:07] you know my my mom and my dad are here
[17:10] tonight and praise god for good parents
[17:13] how many have good parents here tonight
[17:23] you have good parents
[17:25] say hallelujah
[17:28] praise god for good parents and i had a
[17:30] good daddy and you know ever since
[17:32] before i could even walk my daddy always
[17:35] took me out and one of the things that
[17:37] we did together was go hunting
[17:40] how many are hunters here this evening
[17:42] then maybe you'll be able to relate a
[17:44] little bit this evening forgive me if
[17:46] i'm taking long but i want to build upon
[17:48] something
[17:51] and so when we were young he would take
[17:53] me out even before i could walk and as
[17:55] soon as i could walk i carried a bb gun
[17:58] out there and you know i carried a bb
[18:00] gun and then before you know it i was
[18:02] getting older and i was carrying a 22.
[18:06] and i was carrying a 22 and before you
[18:08] know it i started to carry a 30 out of
[18:10] 6.
[18:12] see the boys are happier about this than
[18:14] you guys
[18:19] and i was carrying a 30 out of six
[18:25] they're getting bigger right and then
[18:27] before you know it i put the 30 out of 6
[18:29] down and i got a 300 weather bee
[18:39] yes sir
[18:41] and i like the bow hunt and we started
[18:43] out with just a slingshot
[18:46] and then we got a little bit bigger and
[18:48] we got a recurve
[18:49] and then we got a we got a fred bear
[18:53] and then that bow had all kinds of
[18:55] wheels on it right and you could never
[18:58] tune it
[19:01] but you had a cow pound bow
[19:05] and then they got a martin bow
[19:08] and then we we got what else we got uh
[19:11] uh one of those uh ones that's real
[19:13] quiet like a matthews
[19:16] and then we upgraded
[19:20] i bought my wife ahoy
[19:34] and we hunted anything that that would
[19:37] want with rabbits and squirrels and
[19:39] whatever that it would be
[19:41] but one of the things that i really like
[19:43] to hunt was elk
[19:46] because when you hunt an elf there's a
[19:47] way that you could speak and it'll speak
[19:50] back to you it's called speaking the
[19:53] language
[19:54] and you learn and back in the day we
[19:56] didn't have youtube in all these videos
[19:59] but we had cassettes where you'd get
[20:01] this little thing made by carlton and
[20:03] you'd blow on it and they would make a
[20:05] cow call
[20:07] and you listen to the tape and you'd
[20:09] hear and you say well this is the way
[20:10] that it should sound
[20:12] and you try to imitate it right you say
[20:14] i can't do this
[20:16] and you try your best so
[20:18] back in that day i decided i'd been
[20:20] married for a while and my wife i said i
[20:23] kept asking her let's go hunting with me
[20:26] and she would say no i have no desire to
[20:29] hunt
[20:30] and i said let's go hunting with me and
[20:32] she says one of these days she said i
[20:34] will go hunting with you because maybe
[20:36] i'll help because you never bring home
[20:38] anything
[20:44] so i took her hunting out for the first
[20:46] time and we get up early one morning and
[20:49] we're walking down a ridge
[20:52] and as we're walking down the ridge it's
[20:54] a nice brisk morning it's real quiet you
[20:56] know how it gets and you can hear
[20:58] everything so as we're walking i'm
[21:00] turning around
[21:04] and she said what
[21:09] i said you got to be quiet you got to
[21:11] real just they'll hear you
[21:15] so she's there like
[21:17] so we're walking along the ridge and
[21:20] we're making this little thing a cow
[21:22] call
[21:23] and so you blow it and and it kind of
[21:25] goes
[21:28] and you stop and you listen
[21:32] and you don't hear nothing so you keep
[21:34] walking a few more steps and
[21:40] she's like what are you doing
[21:44] and you walk a little bit
[21:46] and one time
[21:48] and way out in the distance brother
[21:52] we heard
[21:57] and she said
[22:01] i said did you hear that she said
[22:06] so i said come on come on
[22:08] so we're walking no
[22:10] meow and way out in the distance
[22:18] i said okay
[22:19] well we kept doing it it kept getting
[22:21] closer
[22:22] and finally got mirror and it
[22:30] and i just stopped and stood up and said
[22:31] what's wrong
[22:34] i said oh man
[22:36] she said what's wrong
[22:38] and i said well can't you hear that
[22:40] she says what do you mean i said that's
[22:42] the worst imitation of an elk i've ever
[22:44] heard in my life
[22:48] she said what does that mean
[22:50] i said it's another hunter
[22:55] we're calling in another hunter
[22:57] [Applause]
[23:02] so i'm i'm just standing there she says
[23:04] are you sure you better be sure
[23:06] and i said all right so i said we we
[23:08] came we sat on a big rock and i'm just
[23:11] sitting there she says you you you might
[23:13] want to get ready
[23:15] i said babe i already told you
[23:18] it's another hunter
[23:20] so i'm just sitting there on the rock
[23:22] and she's sitting there and before you
[23:24] know it i'm looking down the the hill
[23:26] and all of a sudden here comes a big old
[23:28] rack
[23:30] and it's a big old elk big old bull
[23:33] coming up the hill so fast that i had no
[23:36] time to move
[23:38] and before you know it it's about from
[23:40] right where that brother is right there
[23:41] just stopped and he's looking right at
[23:43] me
[23:44] and i'm standing there with my
[23:46] bow tech

[23:54] looking at him

[24:07] looking and before you know it i said i
[24:10] gotta do something so he's kind of like
[24:15] so i try real quick to bring my bow over
[24:18] and by that time he's gone
[24:22] he had no time to move
[24:24] he's gonna have to look back to my wife

[37:04] he wasn't afraid of the message that god
[37:06] had given him amen
[37:10] that's right come on
[37:16] notice he said he knowed it would happen
[37:20] he knowed it was according to the word
[37:22] of the lord and he know he was god's
[37:24] prophet for the hour
[37:26] [Applause]
[37:29] [Music]
[37:31] therefore the king
[37:33] would cut his head off throw them in
[37:34] jail whatever they do it made no
[37:37] difference to him
[37:39] he had a commission amen
[37:43] he had a commission
[37:45] what was it the same lord
[37:48] that was the commission
[37:51] the son of the lord it ain't gonna rain
[37:54] till i call for it
[37:58] he said that's a mighty big statement
[38:00] isn't it yes it is
[38:02] that's why we can come back and say he
[38:03] wasn't afraid of his message
[38:06] because he know that god had given to
[38:08] him
[38:09] amen and when you finally realize that
[38:11] god gave you this message you'll stop
[38:14] being

[39:17] notice
[39:18] he had a commission was thus saith the
[39:20] lord right in the face of the king
[39:30] right in the face of the king
[39:33] that's why he said that was a rugged man
[39:37] he was a rugged one
[39:41] and notice
[39:42] when you go out west
[39:45] you got to bring your best optics
[39:49] don't be bringing those bushnell
[39:51] come on
[39:57] hey those are okay
[39:59] from here to there
[40:02] but you bring your good optics
[40:04] because you got to see a long way
[40:08] you got to know what you're going after
[40:13] so you go and you search out and you
[40:14] save a little bit and you ask your wife
[40:16] here let me save a little bit
[40:19] to save up for your best optics
[40:21] and then you start moving up to your
[40:23] vortex and you're like
[40:25] and all these things and you land up if
[40:27] you're if you're lucky you're blessed
[40:29] with a swarovski
[40:32] and even then you're still looking out
[40:33] there and wondering what what is that is
[40:35] is that a head block or is that a forker
[40:40] but you see we had a prophet of god
[40:44] and his optics be our best objects
[40:48] and he can go back and all the way in
[40:50] time and he can look back there
[40:53] and he can say hey i can tell you when
[40:56] it started
[40:58] and i can look that way and i can tell
[41:00] you how it's gonna end
[41:03] and we've heard it before that was our
[41:05] profit optics
[41:07] way better than what we got
[41:09] [Applause]
[41:15] so notice what he does
[41:18] he's able to come up a little bit higher
[41:20] and look back there watch what he tells
[41:23] us are you listening
[41:25] he says oh if we can go back and see
[41:28] israel
[41:29] somebody say israel
[41:32] the way they had taken palestine upon
[41:34] the same bases
[41:36] that we took this united states
[41:40] we come into the united states and drove
[41:43] back the occupants which was the
[41:46] indians and possessed the land
[41:50] you know how you possess this land the
[41:52] occupants before were pushed out
[41:58] somebody could say amen to that
[42:00] but notice he parallels it he goes on to
[42:03] say and so did israel yeah
[42:06] notice come into palestine under the
[42:08] leadership of joshua
[42:11] under god and drove back the opposite
[42:13] the occupants and took the land
[42:16] and their first kings were mighty men
[42:19] i'm going to ask you was david a mighty
[42:21] man
[42:22] he was a mighty man
[42:24] was solomon a mighty man he was a mighty
[42:27] man
[42:32] and a great man
[42:34] our first presidents were great man
[42:41] washington
[42:43] come on church he was a great man yes
[42:45] sir
[42:46] what about lincoln
[42:48] he's a great man
[42:52] notice he says and so forth then finally
[42:55] the presidents or kings become getting
[42:58] more rotten
[43:00] all the time
[43:02] [Applause]
[43:04] tell me you can't see it
[43:08] come on try to lie
[43:11] said oh brother no i don't see it i
[43:12] don't see you tell me you can't see it
[43:15] they have gotten worse and worse and
[43:17] worse and worse all the
[43:25] wait come on time okay reiner and reiner
[43:28] and rotten are you reiner
[43:32] to the one we got today
[43:39] and finally they ended up with ahab
[43:42] did you know brother baby said that ahab
[43:45] was the worst of them all
[43:48] he was the worst of all of them
[43:50] so i got back in thinking by the way and
[43:52] i said is he was he the worst did he
[43:54] kill the most did he torture the most
[43:57] did he mistreat the most
[43:59] but our prophet came with those optics
[44:01] to look down and he said he was the
[44:04] worst because he married an unbeliever
[44:09] [Music]
[44:09] [Laughter]
[44:15] [Applause]
[44:20] under no circumstances
[44:23] should you ever marry
[44:25] an unbeliever
[44:31] [Applause]
[44:37] under no
[44:40] you young men say no
[44:42] circumstances should you marry an
[44:45] unbeliever
[44:46] what you say about brother man she's
[44:47] pretty
[44:51] oh brother baby you should say the way
[44:53] she talks to me
[44:56] it's gonna be all right i'm gonna be
[44:57] that rugged man and i'm gonna tell her
[44:59] what to do
[45:03] come on man
[45:04] but then it comes time when little baby
[45:06] comes
[45:08] and now you start making those harder
[45:10] decisions and she comes and tells you
[45:12] well i think we gotta baptize him in the
[45:15] name of the father
[45:17] and in the son and the holy ghost
[45:20] and then what do you say
[45:25] he said oh i'm gonna be the man of this
[45:27] house
[45:29] and she says well i'm out of here then
[45:34] come on
[45:35] you say oh that doesn't happen brother
[45:37] manuel
[45:39] i have a phone number of a sister
[45:41] she said call her if you think it
[45:42] doesn't happen
[45:46] she said brother manny when you preach
[45:47] that have them to know to call me to
[45:49] never marry
[45:51] an unbeliever
[45:53] so ahab was the worst of all of him what
[45:56] did he do because inner wall the real
[45:59] word
[46:00] come on church you know
[46:05] your pastors have preached it to you
[46:09] and so here was ahab the worst of them
[46:11] all
[46:14] very
[46:14] typical of our day brother graham said
[46:17] and the people had gotten so modern
[46:22] somebody say preacher brother
[46:25] they've gotten so modern
[46:30] the people of that day had gotten so
[46:32] modern what do you mean brother
[46:34] wealthier

[47:39] they were wealthier and healthier come
[47:41] on church
[47:43] they were more informed
[47:46] they had more information in that day
[47:48] they were modern
[47:56] notice what brother batman said he said
[47:58] and the people had gotten so modern
[48:01] they didn't want to hear the true word
[48:05] of god
[48:06] did you know you can get so modern so
[48:09] smart
[48:11] so healthy
[48:13] so wealthy
[48:14] that you get to a point where the man of
[48:16] god comes and preaches the word you
[48:18] can't even move and say amen
[48:24] and maybe not you because you're hearing
[48:26] the word but what are the people out
[48:27] there
[48:30] and they want you to join him in that
[48:36] what do you mean it means when a crazy
[48:38] preacher comes
[48:42] he said i don't know that's a little too
[48:44] wild for me that's a little too rugged
[48:50] where'd they pull this guy out of

[48:55] preach it amen but that's what they said
[48:57] about elijah
[48:59] [Applause]
[49:06] what audacity does he have to come to
[49:08] the king
[49:16] notice
[49:18] brother man says can you imagine
[49:20] on a modern people like that
[49:23] so we set the foundation the modern
[49:25] people healthier wealthier and wiser and
[49:27] more informed
[49:30] that's right all right so he's saying to
[49:31] people like that he says can you imagine
[49:35] he says what a real servant of god would
[49:37] sound like
[49:47] notice he said could you what a real
[49:49] true servant of god would sound like why
[49:51] he was crazy
[49:53] out of his mind

[50:01] my pastor is so
[50:03] smart
[50:08] he's so educated
[50:24] wild yeah
[50:26] and they said we can't hear this

[51:29] the man is preaching hard and he's
[51:32] yelling and he's screaming and he's
[51:33] crying at the same time

[54:50] isaac paige numero uno
[54:56] you don't know what that means though
[54:59] page number one brother
[55:04] notice he's saying could you imagine a
[55:05] modern people like that
[55:08] coming a servant of god would come out
[55:09] of the wilderness they would think he's
[55:12] out of his mind
[55:14] notice brother man says they were
[55:15] religious very religious
[55:19] they had sincere men
[55:22] they sound familiar
[55:25] they had sincere men they had sincere
[55:28] people
[55:30] the people were sincere too but notice
[55:32] he says they was very
[55:34] religious
[55:37] so modern they couldn't hear the true
[55:40] word when it was right in front of them
[55:44] [Music]
[55:47] notice so
[55:49] here we have a prophet of god elijah on
[55:52] the scene
[55:54] and he knows what he's dealing with
[55:57] he knows the condition of the people he
[56:00] knows how they're modern he knows how
[56:02] they act he knows they're religious he
[56:04] knows they're sincere
[56:14] notice elijah knew
[56:17] brother bear said that it would take
[56:18] more
[56:19] than just ordinary theology
[56:25] hey you ought to be calling tonight for
[56:26] more than just theology
[56:28] [Applause]
[56:32] say brother we've already been through
[56:33] calvinism we've been through armenianism
[56:35] we want ephesus
[56:38] we want a book of ephesians
[56:44] notice he said
[56:47] it would take more than just ordinary
[56:49] theology
[56:51] it would take more than an ordinary
[56:54] message
[57:00] it wasn't that you were just gonna come
[57:01] and preach and say oh you know what i'm
[57:03] just gonna throw something together
[57:08] you know i'm busy i i don't have much
[57:10] time so i'll just take whatever all that
[57:12] it doesn't matter i'm just gonna put it
[57:14] together
[57:16] but you see that might be all right in
[57:18] some cases but not for a people like
[57:21] that's right
[57:28] he said it'd take more than an ordinary
[57:30] message for that people
[57:33] it would take more than just preaching
[57:35] the word right
[57:37] that's right
[57:39] come on come on
[57:40] yep
[57:43] wait a minute brother i'm saying that my
[57:45] brother sean has stopped me in my tracks
[57:48] i was reading i said what it's going to
[57:49] take more than just preaching
[57:52] more than just preaching the word
[57:56] well that people was religious they had
[57:58] been preached the word
[58:01] come on church ahab had prophets
[58:03] he had hundreds of prophets he had
[58:06] hundreds of smart men hundreds of
[58:08] theology
[58:10] so here comes elijah with the word of
[58:12] god he said it's gonna take more than an
[58:14] ordinary preaching
[58:17] it's gonna take more than an ordinary
[58:19] word
[58:20] [Applause]
[58:26] we love the word but it has to be for
[58:28] our day
[58:29] for our hour
[58:37] it would take more than just preaching
[58:39] the word to do what to crack their stony
[58:44] hearts
[58:46] yes
[58:47] that's right
[58:49] you know it's easy to say oh well they
[58:50] have stormy hearts so those people down
[58:52] the street have stony hearts or they're
[58:54] stonies but what about this boy when he
[58:57] had a stony heart
[59:01] the bible had to take me to ezekiel
[59:04] and say he'll give me a new spirit and
[59:07] he'll give me a new heart
[59:09] [Applause]
[59:11] what for just to be able to hear the
[59:14] word
[59:16] then he says when you receive that then
[59:19] he'll come and give you his spirit
[59:23] yes sir

[1:00:06] take thus saith the lord
[1:00:11] that's what it's going to take in this

[1:03:45] he said that wasn't no ordinary message
[1:03:49] in fact brother he said it was quite a
[1:03:51] load
[1:03:52] he said that was quite a load that he
[1:03:54] dropped on that king
[1:04:01] notice he said
[1:04:03] oh he said that's quite a messenger
[1:04:06] not no ordinary message
[1:04:08] and now he said we're going to type that
[1:04:10] with the spiritual drought today
[1:04:14] now we all know and we are very aware so
[1:04:16] you're very aware you know
[1:04:19] he said that there is a great spiritual
[1:04:21] drow in the land today spiritually
[1:04:24] speaking can we say amen to that amen
[1:04:27] and you know that was predicted by the
[1:04:29] prophets
[1:04:31] just before the second coming of christ
[1:04:33] would be
[1:04:35] said there will come a famine in the
[1:04:37] land and it won't be for bread alone
[1:04:40] but for the hearing of the word of god
[1:04:42] and that day is now
[1:04:45] [Applause]
[1:04:47] hearing the word of god he said now this
[1:04:50] types the natural with the spiritual
[1:04:52] sin somebody say sin
[1:04:56] and unbelief
[1:04:58] sin and unbelief by false teachers
[1:05:03] and modernists
[1:05:06] in the church
[1:05:08] [Applause]
[1:05:11] in the church had brought
[1:05:14] the place to this come this coming on
[1:05:18] coming judgment
[1:05:20] what brought the judgment of eliza down
[1:05:22] one brought god come on church eliza was
[1:05:25] happy he was being fed by the ravens he
[1:05:28] was there he wanted to drink some water
[1:05:30] by the brook
[1:05:33] in fact when god called him i said lord
[1:05:35] why are you drying up the water
[1:05:40] come on
[1:05:41] right because i got a job for you to do
[1:05:45] there's an oncoming judgment going on
[1:05:48] because of sin and unbelief
[1:05:51] where come on now
[1:05:57] [Music]
[1:05:58] we all got to say where was it coming
[1:06:00] from
[1:06:02] in the church
[1:06:05] aren't you glad you come out of it
[1:06:10] [Applause]
[1:06:19] notice
[1:06:20] i hope this is all right
[1:06:26] notice he said
[1:06:27] sin and unbelief by false teachers and
[1:06:30] modernists in the church
[1:06:32] had brought this place to a coming
[1:06:34] oncoming judgment then they had turned
[1:06:37] from god's word and his prophet to a
[1:06:39] modern theological
[1:06:41] terms of the word
[1:06:45] be careful you don't get too
[1:06:46] sophisticated
[1:06:50] don't get too civilized
[1:06:57] so elijah was put in a secret place
[1:06:59] didn't we read that in the scripture
[1:07:01] yeah who put him there
[1:07:03] the lord put him in this place
[1:07:06] and we have an understanding that god
[1:07:08] had ordained it god had ordained him and
[1:07:12] the place was provided for and elijah
[1:07:14] was getting fed day by day by day in
[1:07:18] this secret place
[1:07:22] now we all have an understanding ahab
[1:07:24] the king did not put elijah in his place
[1:07:31] the church did not put elijah in that
[1:07:33] place
[1:07:36] let me tell you elijah did not put
[1:07:38] elijah in that place
[1:07:43] [Applause]
[1:07:45] god said i have commanded the ravens to
[1:07:48] feed you
[1:07:49] now we have an understanding that that's
[1:07:51] a type of our secret place
[1:07:54] where in christ jesus
[1:07:57] we have a secret place too
[1:07:59] where is it it's in christ
[1:08:01] [Applause]
[1:08:04] now we have to understand during the
[1:08:06] time that he was sent
[1:08:07] judgment to the unbeliever but he was
[1:08:10] said to make a way
[1:08:12] for the believer
[1:08:17] amen for what to escape the wrath to
[1:08:19] come
[1:08:22] but they laughed at him
[1:08:25] they thought he was crazy
[1:08:30] now did you notice we've been taught
[1:08:33] that a denominational man somebody said
[1:08:35] denominational
[1:08:38] a denominational man with him and the
[1:08:40] support of his denomination

[1:09:20] theology
[1:09:21] and that theologian becomes one
[1:09:25] with his theology
[1:09:29] but notice you take a catholic with the
[1:09:31] support of his denomination and he
[1:09:33] becomes
[1:09:36] you take a baptist
[1:09:38] with the support of the baptist and he

[1:21:11] yes
[1:21:12] notice but elijah said give me that
[1:21:14] first
[1:21:16] for thus saith the lord
[1:21:18] the barrel will not go empty neither the
[1:21:20] crews run dry
[1:21:22] until the day the lord god sends the
[1:21:24] rain upon the earth
[1:21:28] brother takes that and he says putting
[1:21:30] god first
[1:21:34] how many realize that we've got to put
[1:21:36] who first
[1:21:37] we've got to put god first
[1:21:43] now when we preach that these brothers
[1:21:45] preach that we all say oh yeah
[1:21:49] but i can say well you guys you gotta
[1:21:50] put god first you say oh yeah
[1:21:56] and the minister brother ronnie comes
[1:21:58] and he preaches he says guys you gotta
[1:21:59] put god first you say yeah i do
[1:22:06] but let me tell you during a draw
[1:22:13] somebody say preach it
[1:22:15] brother mary i see you back there you
[1:22:16] say preach it brother
[1:22:23] but during a drought
[1:22:25] right now
[1:22:31] now let me tell you a famine
[1:22:34] can bring out the best in somebody
[1:22:44] a family can bring out the best or it
[1:22:48] can bring out the absolute worst
[1:22:52] and who your neighbor
[1:22:55] and who your pastor
[1:23:00] himself
[1:23:02] we can all say amen but when it comes
[1:23:05] and god puts us through the testing time
[1:23:07] and he will
[1:23:09] [Applause]
[1:23:10] it'll bring out really what you are
[1:23:14] really what you got if you've got the
[1:23:17] goods
[1:23:18] [Applause]
[1:23:22] can i give you a bible example tonight
[1:23:25] [Applause]
[1:23:27] one time during a great famine
[1:23:30] in the book of second kings
[1:23:33] they uh israel was surrounded
[1:23:37] and noticed the king was there walking
[1:23:39] around and he was seeing the worst in
[1:23:41] his people
[1:23:46] they had been cut off from supplies
[1:23:51] and he looked and there was a woman that
[1:23:53] cried o king
[1:23:58] and the king said what's the matter
[1:24:03] and she answered
[1:24:05] and she told the king
[1:24:08] she said
[1:24:09] well there was this woman
[1:24:14] and she said unto me
[1:24:17] give thy son that we may eat him
[1:24:22] today
[1:24:27] and we will eat my son
[1:24:30] tomorrow
[1:24:33] so we boiled
[1:24:35] my son
[1:24:41] a famine brings out the worst or the
[1:24:43] best
[1:24:47] yes sir yes
[1:24:49] there's a spiritual famine in the land
[1:24:51] today
[1:24:54] they're boiling their children
[1:25:10] and said unto her the next day give thy
[1:25:14] son that we may eat him
[1:25:16] and she hid her son
[1:25:21] so the point is the famine will bring
[1:25:23] out the best
[1:25:25] or it'll bring out the worst
[1:25:30] can we say amen tonight
[1:25:34] what a test
[1:25:37] you can go back it's all brother emanuel
[1:25:38] that was such a hard test for her
[1:25:41] when the prophet of god came and told
[1:25:43] her give me the little cake first
[1:25:47] that's right
[1:25:49] but notice we have the greatest prophet
[1:25:51] of them all
[1:25:52] [Applause]
[1:25:55] and in matthew 10 in red letters he said
[1:25:59] he that loveth father
[1:26:02] or mother
[1:26:03] more than me is not worthy of me
[1:26:10] and he that love his son or daughter
[1:26:13] more than me is not worthy than me of me
[1:26:17] can we say amen that's a test
[1:26:22] and in matthew
[1:26:24] chapter 6 31 jesus says therefore take
[1:26:28] no fa
[1:26:29] saying what shall we
[1:26:32] yes sir
[1:26:33] or what shall we drink
[1:26:35] or wherever all should we be clothed
[1:26:38] for after all these things do the
[1:26:40] gentiles seek
[1:26:42] for your heavenly father knoweth that
[1:26:44] you have need of these things
[1:26:47] but seek ye first
[1:26:53] no this is for you
[1:26:56] but seek ye first the kingdom of god and
[1:27:00] his righteousness and all these things
[1:27:02] shall be added unto you
[1:27:05] [Applause]
[1:27:08] there you go so elijah says bake me a
[1:27:11] little cake first
[1:27:14] and in other words we know that was
[1:27:15] saint put cries
[1:27:16] first why was he saying that he said
[1:27:19] because here he was coming delivering
[1:27:22] the care package
[1:27:24] [Applause]
[1:27:26] come on man just give it to me first
[1:27:29] i got some for you
[1:27:31] just give it to me first
[1:27:34] oh that's what we're saying tonight just
[1:27:36] give god preeminence tonight he's got so
[1:27:39] much waiting for you he wants to give it
[1:27:41] to you
[1:27:43] he wants to give it to you right now oh
[1:27:46] you just put him first
[1:27:48] put him before school put him before
[1:27:51] mama put him before daddy before brother
[1:27:53] before sister put him first
[1:27:56] he's got so much waiting for you
[1:28:01] that's the ultimate care package
[1:28:04] you know the word care
[1:28:06] it means health how many want health
[1:28:10] you know the word care means welfare how
[1:28:13] many god want god to take care of your
[1:28:15] welfare
[1:28:17] not the welfare system
[1:28:21] how many want god to be their
[1:28:22] maintenance man
[1:28:24] maintain me lord maintain my body this
[1:28:27] is part of the health care system of god
[1:28:32] care means protection how many want god
[1:28:34] to be your protection
[1:28:37] care means supervision how many want to
[1:28:40] be supervised by god
[1:28:42] care means health that means safe it
[1:28:44] means housekeeping
[1:28:50] so here was elijah all he was doing was
[1:28:52] bringing the care package
[1:28:59] what was he bringing
[1:29:01] [Applause]
[1:29:06] he was bringing the word the
[1:29:08] unadulterated word
[1:29:10] that men have messed with for years and
[1:29:13] he came and he tied up all the loose
[1:29:16] hands and he gave us the care package
[1:29:20] he said you want care you've got to care
[1:29:23] package this is the best package you'll
[1:29:26] ever see
[1:29:27] this is better than the massage practice
[1:29:29] in the vehicle the self-driving car
[1:29:33] this is the care package
[1:29:36] no wonder they thought he was crazy
[1:29:38] [Applause]
[1:29:40] no wonder they think your preachers are
[1:29:42] crazy
[1:29:51] you know that it was a test of trust
[1:29:56] and you've all been going through it
[1:30:00] did you know that she had to give
[1:30:04] up the very thing that she was certain
[1:30:07] of
[1:30:09] that's right
[1:30:12] she had it in her hands this was
[1:30:13] certainty
[1:30:15] she said we're going to eat this
[1:30:17] she was certain of it and she had to
[1:30:20] give up certainty
[1:30:23] and many of us had had to give up
[1:30:25] certainty right a position in the church
[1:30:31] friendship with a pastor
[1:30:35] this is the truth that's right we've had
[1:30:38] to give up so much that's right that was
[1:30:40] right there in front of us
[1:30:43] that was certain
[1:30:45] for what the supernatural
[1:30:50] she had to give up the certain for the
[1:30:52] supernatural
[1:31:00] she had to trust a promise
[1:31:03] she had to trust thus saith the lord
[1:31:09] if the musicians would come up
[1:31:11] let's have the song leader
[1:31:14] give me five more minutes as they come
[1:31:15] up
[1:31:23] remember when we opened up and we read
[1:31:27] jesus saying there were many widows in
[1:31:29] israel
[1:31:30] in the days
[1:31:32] of elijah
[1:31:36] but elijah was sent to
[1:31:43] are you still with me
[1:31:46] thank you
[1:31:47] elijah was sent to just
[1:31:50] one what
