you just help me to get myself out of the way Lord and father that you would bless your people tonight we ask it father and we just Commit This service into your hands now in Jesus Christ's name amen and amen we want to look at uh the book of Ephesians um the first chapter first verse we'll start there but it says Paul an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God to the Saints which are at Ephesus and to the faithful in Christ Jesus Grace be to you and peace from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ uh who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in Christ according as he has chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will amen then if you'll turn with me uh to the book of First Peter I believe uh the first chapter First Peter chapter 1 and while you're turning there um next Wednesday uh brother Ben shaml is going to be ministering for us he's a young young brother and um uh they were passing through uh the family and um many of you may know the the shamama family but um they they were coming through and so I asked if he would Minister uh next Wednesday and then also uh brother Andrew uh will be here Wednesday night as well and uh he he wanted to to come and talk to you all uh talk to all of us I guess um on a Sunday but uh it's just not working out at this time um uh he's he's trying to get trying to get um move his schedule around but uh um uh pastors aren't um well they they just holding him to the fire at this point and so um uh so he he asked if that would be all right I said well that that'll be fine and so um he's going to be here Wednesday night going to uh to talk to us and uh maybe you'll know more about his heart and where he's at and so I ask that all all of the home folk if you can come uh um I know Wednesday nights are a little bit um uh uh um well low low on the crowd but uh if if you can and maybe if someone's watching uh online but we'll uh talk with maybe sister Martha to uh send out a text but um so if if you can be here Wednesday that would be be great and um uh then at a later time um we we're going to try to get brother Andrew to come and Minister for us and so um anyways but U so first Peter I think that's where we're at First Peter 1:23 amen it says being born again not of corruptible seed but of Incorruptible by the word of God which liveth and abideth forever amen then 1 Peter 2 and two just write down a little bit it says wherefore uh we we'll start the first verse wherefore laying aside all malice and all Gile and hypocrisies and envies and all evil speakings as newborn babes desire the milk of the word that you may grow thereby amen you can have your seats praise the Lord the um and it's good to have brother Josiah and David amen and uh back from Ohio but um um now if if I could uh maybe H use a title it would be growing in the right atmosphere and um you know uh I'm glad that we have the ability to grow uh God wants us to grow we're we're not just here church members just what in our thumb waiting for the Rapture to happen uh we're growing into it we're growing into full statures of sons of God and uh we we know that God uh didn't start working on a plan uh uh for our lives when we got saved um um but God um being all knowing and uh having an infinite mind uh then he he had a plan before the foundation of the world so he didn't start working on a plan he's not currently working on a plan for your life for my life he's already got it uh uh taken care of and Isaiah 46 and9 it says remember the former things of old for I am God and there is none else I am God and there is none like me declaring the end from the beginning and from ancient times the things that are not yet done so then God already knows all about us do you believe that and um uh and and so uh we're we're he he's a he's a god of purpose he's a God that uh does things uh in his timing and and he's got things that he just doesn't do by accident he didn't save you by accident he didn't come to die by accident and he didn't come to do all these things uh just in general uh maybe to save you and then just leave you to what you decide what you want to do in life and I decide what I want to do in life and then we just all arrive at different places and then the Rapture comes but he's got a specific will he's got a specific destination he's got a he's got a specific outcome that he wants for all of our Lives you believe that so now we so we we e every every minute detail of his plan for our lives um I is well I I just personally believe that it's not revealed to us all at once I I think we could all um agree to that that there are times that we think God uh what what is your plan for my life what do I do next what do I do you know you know and and and so it kind of leaves us stumped sometimes it kind of leaves us as you know what you know what are we doing here you know and but but one thing that we do know is that God does have a plan for us and so he he doesn't just uh stop in Midstream and he he you know just because you and I feel like maybe we're wasting time or or that uh uh nothing is is really going on in our lives does not mean that God has aborted his plan concerning us it's just we we we we feel these things sometime because uh we don't know just every every plan or every uh minute detail that God has for us now I I believe that the the desired end of God's purpose has been revealed to us uh it has been uh like like the Bible even talks about being conformed uh to the image of his son now you didn't start out that way when you were born and you didn't start out that way when you were saved but that is the desired end that God has for all of us do you believe that not just one not just for the prophet but for all of us as the bride of Christ uh uh the Bible talks about the adoption of sons the manifestation of sons uh it it you know talks about fellowship with him and uh uh defeating the devil at every turn and and and the the prophet talked about you know uh uh living so so uh to a place that the devil don't know what to do with us well these are are I I believe that this is the desired end of what God is after that's that's the that's the goal that God is after for all of our Lives amen and and so it's the end result and so every promise of God and and and and this is what I love about it is that God even though we may not know God's will in in between uh times sometimes but it does leave us that there is an outcome to everything you you you may be in your trial right now but you can look at the book and know that there's an outcome to that trial and and and uh uh uh uh so there there's always the outcome and and that outcome is we are victorious that outcome is that God is with us that outcome is that we will be more like him that that outcome do you believe that amen and and so sometime we cry sometimes we we we we scratch our head and sometime we just feel all alone and sometime but but we can always no matter where you're at in life and and and and what Direction and and you might just feel like your life is upside down and and all this stuff you can always take it by the Bible and look that there's an outcome God is faithful to his word do you believe that and and so uh uh uh now so so th this is God uh that that is Desiring for us to come up uh uh to hire now we we are not trying to achieve these things uh to come up with the the uh um desired end that God has for our life we're we're not trying to accomplish that on our own amen and um um you know we're not trying to achieve something that is not already within us to to do it amen it's already within us to do these things do you believe that amen see we already we already have the potential uh uh with in us and brother brandham called this potential he called it God's potential amen so we have his potentials already within us now that word potential is existing in possibility capable of development into actuality amen so these potentials are already in you it's it's not God adding it to you giving it to you but it was already given to you for the foundation of the world so this word potential also means promise and that word promise in this uh instance is reason to expect something ground for expectation of success Improvement or Excellence can you say Amen so so we hold the his potential we we we hold the promise of of of of achieving of excelling of development amen and and so we don't have to sit there amen and and whether we feel capable or not it's already within us to achieve amen whether you you you cannot look at yourself and say well I just don't know how I'm going to do it it's already in you to do it amen it it's already uh uh put within you so so then then for us to say well I can never be anything different than what I already am that's wrong even to talk like that well well I've always been this way so I can never change amen that's wrong to even look at it that way the potential's already in you to be what God has called you to be amen do you believe that see and and so uh uh you know as I uh you know uh hear my children uh you know play instruments at home and and and and see you know I as I'm hearing it I I hear that they I I can hear the potential I I see that there's potential already in them of becoming great musicians it's it's already in them and and see the potential is there they they you know they can get on the piano and they start picking things out and and and that tells me that they've got a potential it's there amen they get on the drums they get on the bass they get on you know whatever and the guitar or whatever the potential is already there within them amen to to become something greater amen uh and and and so now uh uh they they they can live in an atmosphere you know uh where with with people that don't like music and that just Trash Talk musicians and don't have a desire and they think you know that music is just stupid and and and anyone that wants to play music is just crazy and well they can live among them people like that and and and you'll watch it will affect that potential that they have within them maybe you know they they they won't try as hard they won't they won't dedicate as as much they won't venture out into the music world because everybody's going to laugh at them see they they come into an atmosphere where where you know no one sees any need for music and they they think it's crazy or or whatever can you say man and and so they they will never fully develop but you get them in in uh uh someone that has that potential to become a great musician or whatever get them around good teachers get them around good uh musicians get get get them around that they feed from that and they they talk music and they live music and they breathe music and people's encouraging them people's giving them the opportunity to Excel and and and these things then then that potential that is already already in them all of a sudden will start blossoming and start developing and and and and but it was already in them to begin with they were just in the atmosphere that would allow them to express and allow them to to grow now so so that may be just a little bit of a a u uh an example that you think well that was kind of crazy but but it it's still what it's something that I think is uh fit uh uh in Matthew 13th chapter um uh Jesus talked to two different kinds of seeds uh being sown and that is the wheat and that is the tears ain't that right and so the seed was swn by two different sers uh uh uh God and Satan they're they're the sers and God solded his seed first uh and he sold the wheat amen and uh which Jesus called The Good Seed and then Satan came along afterward and sold his seed which was the tears ain't that right amen and and Jesus said that they they the seed that they sewed it into amen or what they sowed into was the the the world the field is the world that that both sers sowed seed in and so Jesus said that the good seed that that that God would swow is the children of the kingdom and and the seed that Satan s sold amen uh uh is the children of the wicked one amen see and so but but look at that seed that God that God sold amen it is not just a seed it's a predestinated seed do you believe that it's a predestinated seed and so now it may surprise you that that there are people that don't believe in predestination and uh you know um uh they they believe that if a man has any seed then it's it within him it's it's it's it's been sown here um uh while he's been here on the earth and all that uh uh by receiving the word of God into his heart but but but this Incorruptible seed was swn into a man before the world ever began uh and that comes by predestination and and you know uh uh so so uh by that predestination God has already determined your path God's already determined your outcome God's already put the potential already within you so this is not a guesswork to God this is not just something that is random amen but this is something that God purposed for your life amen as I said he doesn't explain all the mountains and The Valleys that we go through amen but he's already determined an out an outcome for our lives and then he put that potential within you ain't that right amen see amen it's the only way that you could have a new birth amen you you couldn't even have a new birth if there was not a predestinated seed within you amen for uh brother brandom said we did not become seed by the rebirth we were seed therefore were reborn for only the elect can be reborn because we were seed is the reason we could be quickened in nonseed there is nothing to Quicken can you say Amen so if there's a seed there there that means there's potential there and if the Holy Ghost would just come across amen and Quicken that seed amen there's that potential potential amen everybody say I've got his potential amen I've got his potential now we we look there in Mark 334 Jesus said the Seth the word so the word is the seed that is sown ain't that right so it's not flesh and blood that God sold out into the world Amen but the word was sold amen by the spoken word god determined your path God determined your outcome God determined to save you God determined to fill you with the Holy Ghost God determined that you're going to come to him amen and and reign with him God's determined that you're going to overcome every situation God determined it and then he puts that seed that little word seed down inside of you now that that that seed the prophet goes on in the latter part of his his ministry uh uh and really just within the last few messages of his ministry he starts talking about the gene seed of God a genan seed that's that's what that was it's a genan seed of God not this old flesh but what that word seed that's in you is a jean seed of God that's why you have his potentials you have his potentials because it's not just god making you a church member God made you a son just like him with the same power the same attributes the same Holiness The Same Spirit every everything that God is now you have been made partakers of Amen you have his potentials so brother brandom said you are a part of God's Gene which makes you part of his word another place you are you're a gene a spiritual Gene out of your heavenly father a part of God's word can you say Amen another place he says when the word of God let our soul we become sons and daughters of God with the attributes see the gene of God in us see to be Sons and Daughters of the father God in heaven crying Abba Father we have gone from Mortal being time beings to Eternal beings something happened when that seed that was in you amen it quickened it was quickened by the Holy Ghost then all of a sudden you become no more a time being amen a mortal being you become an eternal being amen how could else could you be an eternal being except God put it in you when he placed that word seed down inside of your soul can you say amen amen amen what what contradictory we got a word seed that is eternal that speaks of Eternal things that speaks of a bright future that that that is the potential of being Sons and Daughters of God and and having the authority and reigning and yet in this life as Immortal beings amen we we are subject to sickness we're subject to discouragement we're subject Amen to to mind battles we're subject to failure we're subject to all of these things but the potential is there to rise above it all the potential so the genan seed that word seed has been quickened by the quickening power of God ain't that right so as the elect of God we have a word seed and that seed must come to its full potential it must come to its reality form ain't that right it's got to now that's our hope that's our hope we have a greater hope I hope you understand that this ain't getting work this ain't something that I just I hope I hope I hope man if we have that kind of a hope we might as well just go to a football game look at all them people they pay all that money they buy all the the the colors and the logo all of that they I mean you know they're a football fan you know what maybe a baseball fan but you know what team they're on and they'll pay whatever money to go I mean they they'll stay in a hotel they'll stay and they have no idea they have no no assurance that their team's going to win they spend all of that money and and and may go home defeated or whatever but that's the hope they have then you got people that are just fighting and fussing and so involved in politics and they there's nothing there that's going to change them all the promises are in vain do you believe that because there's no potential in politics not not for a change not for a bright future and it's true there's no potentials there just Humanity trying to fix Humanity it ain't going to work but down inside of that elect God put his potentials his potentials God ain't defeated he's a coner and he put that potential in you as I have overcome so you shall over overcome can you say amen he put that look when he when he when he spoke the word and he created this world by his spoken word he put that very potential inside of you and he says if you say to this mountain and doubt not and believe what you say you shall have what you say it's the potentials that are there that's right that's the truth the peace of God that passees all understanding he said my peace I leave with you he put you he gave you that potentials can you say Amen so every seed that that seed must come to its full potential full development now brother Brown said the seed planted in the right ground will produce anything everybody say anything that the seed represents right say that again the seed that is planted in the right ground now I want to say this God did not make mistake when he put a jean seed inside of you he wasn't guessing he saw you as a Believer he knew that you would want to be saved he knew that you would want to get the Holy Ghost he knew that you would strive with all that's within you as that Lily coming out of that mud of that pond and and all of that he was born defeated brother BR said we're all born defeated but there's something down inside of us that reaches out for full development God saw that he didn't make a mistake when he placed that seed in you he put it in the right ground prepared ground and the seed planted in the right ground will produce anything that the seed represents can you say amen he didn't put that kind of seed in in Cain amen that seed wouldn't have grown in Cain that's just facts that's why he did not predestinate by well I like this one and I don't like that one and I like this one he he he didn't predestinate that way he predestinated knowing amen he by his for knowledge he knew you would want it he knew that if ever given a chance you would give everything to it amen but Cain he knew that Cain wouldn't want it he even gave Cain that opportunity can you say Amen now in in the beginning uh there was seeds laying in the earth just laying dormant and then God would say let the Earth bring forth grass let the fruit tree yield forth after its kind let the herb yield seed after its kind let of the seeds that were laying there yield after its kind bring forth ain't that right not just bring forth the the tree come forth but let the the fruit come forth from that tree why it was already in that seed a ain't that right you plant the seed in the ground amen and by the law of God it's got to come forth It's got to come through development it's got to come through its trials and the wind and the storms and all that but the potential is in the seed you know that there's a fruit that's going to come forth it's there that's right so God planted them seeds and he and and and he wanted each of them to come to their full development ain't that right but why couldn't they do it at first the seeds were laying there am man but but why couldn't he do it why couldn't they come into full development well according to Genesis 1:2 water covered the Earth Darkness was upon the face of the deep can you say amen God put the the potential was there in that seat it was laying in there but there was the wrong atmosphere it could not come forth so God by his grace and mercy and his power he he didn't give up on his plan he didn't look at the impossibility amen and say well there ain't no Hope i' they've been laying there for whatever I don't know how long them seeds were laying there but God knew they were laying there and God had a plan for them laying there ain't that right and God by his sovereignty started to change things around the Bible says he said God said let there be light and there was light and the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters and divided the waters so what was God doing he was changing the atmosphere so that the seed could grow and develop into its full potentials that God had had uh uh desired for it to do you see the atmosphere must be right do you believe that brother Bram said you can lay a seed out there in the ground and no matter how much that seed is gerti and layth there it's got to have an atmosphere everybody saying atmosphere to make it live do you believe that see the sun has to come to a certain power before bring it to a certain atmosphere see an egg has to have an atmosphere or it won't hatch no matter how fertile it is it's got to have an atmosphere amen yes sir I I I want to sit this way no matter how many youth camps you go to young people that's that's wonderful but you got stay under an atmosphere right you got to there's an atmosphere that we have to live inise the Lord that's right brother brah says any seed will bring forth of its kind if it's in the right condition the right atmosphere now we know that there are two atmospheres two kinds of atmospheres in the world that we can choose to live in right I want you to understand that we can choose to live in see we're fre free moral agents and everybody likes to likes that idea we're not like the robot that's that's got it computed within us NOP amen we have the choice amen and and to live in in to choose the atmospheres What atmosphere we want to live in but I can tell you this you cannot live in both atmospheres at the same time right you can't live in in the two atmosphere at same time why because the law of life and the law of death cannot work in the same atmosphere right there's either a an atmosphere for the law of of life and there's an atmosphere that works the law of death ain't that right in the Garden of Eden there were two atmospheres amen one was by God's word God spoke his word and man believed it and brother Bram said as long as he believed it he lived in the atmosphere of faith and he lived ain't that right the atmosphere of faith comes by the spoken word of God faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of God ain't that right so God would create the Atmosphere by speaking his word and as long as man believe believe that word he lived in an atmosphere of faith and he lived death could not come to him Satan come along and spoke his word of Deceit and when man believed that over God's word then he lived in an atmosphere of unbelief and he died the law of death took over in the atmosphere of unbelief can you say amen and if you know noticed every every Revival throughout the ages have died when unbelief set in because it it it it created an atmosphere and the word of God could not come forth in in in in in that in that church or or whatever every denomination church is dead can you say amen and it's it's not because they didn't hear the word it's not because whatever it's because they chose to disbelieve and to believe Satan's lie over the word of God and it killed it so when man come to live in the atmosphere of unbelief by believing Satan's lie aen he died and he never come to his full potential as a Son of God and we know that he forfeited the book he forfeited eternal life he forfeited his sunship he forfeited is right can you say amen that's right see now so uh uh he he he done this now now in order to believe Satan's word Satan's word which is none other than a lie Satan's word is a lie amen do you believe that can you say that with me Satan's word is a lie anything that's a lies coming from the devil for he's the father of Lies can you say Amen he's is the father of it meaning he's the author of Lies he inspires lies he inspires things that is not true it comes from him deception is a lie impersonation is a lie hypocrisy is a lie ain't that right see so God's word is the ultimate truth I know people get bothered when we say this message is the absolute it's the ultimate truth right amen on you got to have an absolute and Truth should be our absolute can you say amen amen see so then to believe anything contrary to God's word is to believe a lie to believe a lie now you have to turn God's word down first before you can believe Satan's lie ain't that right now so so man believed Satan's lie and it brought him into an atmosphere of death he had the potential that's right of creating Sons just like himself speaking Sons into existence just like himself but he bypassed that he forfeited it because he come into an atmosphere of death it brought him into this atmosphere of death can you say Amen now notice brother Brown said where faith is preached from the word the children live you see why it's important to preach Faith why it's important to preach the promises why it's important to preach the things that God says about us we we can't preach by what we see in us we we can't that that we don't want you to believe in the things that that you see about yourself ex can't believe in your failures can't believe in your faults can't believe in your own potentials but where the word of God is preached faith comes from that word of God and the children live can you say Amen see so if you want to come to your full potential in God believe the word of God create that atmosphere of Faith the word of God is so important to us amen Hall if you want to live then believe the word if this church is to live We must believe the word if you want your home to survive you must believe the word hey homes are marriages are being attacked left and right homes are being attacked churches are believers are being attacked amen the attack is on every front but if you want to come to your potential believe God's word do you realize that God cannot heal you if the atmosphere isn't right for your healing I really want us to focus on that atmosphere tonight the atmosphere is important when you come to church don't sit there like a KN on a log create an atmosphere can you say amen amen if if we can especially as as we that believe that we're mature amen if we could discern amen that that our job is to create an atmosphere amen someone else might be going through a trial someone else might be sick somebody else might be whatever but if we can create the right atmosphere for God to break through amen and and and do his work and you sayen create the atmosphere God got to have the atmosphere see so we must have the atmosphere of Faith amen and and and believing brother Bram said that we're going to be healed we must have the atmosphere of Faith how are we going to have that by believing that we're going to be healed not saying well if I come up and pray for we'll see what happens you know well if if so and so will pray for me well you know I know some people don't like the pastor to pray for them and and so if certain evangelist can come you know I know I'll be healed that's not the right atmosphere amen you've got to come into the atmosphere that you believe the word of God Amen and you know that whatever God says I know I'm going to be healed they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover I know I know I'm going to be healed that's an atmosphere of Faith amen can you say man come to church expecting God to do something you got you got things that are bothering you come on expect God to do something for you to where you don't have to leave like that again you don't have to leave with doubt you don't have to leave with troubles you don't have to leave tormented can you say Amen but it isn't because you come to church it's because you created an atmosphere you can come to church and if there's no atmosphere then nothing happens an atmosphere of Faith you see brother Brown said God cannot move everybody say God cannot move oh we say oh God if you just move oh God if you just do it God cannot move until Faith Comes can you say Amen now we Jesus already told us amen that that there's four types of ground and one of them grounds is every time that God SWS the seed amen Satan comes alone and snatches it away now notice brother Braham said this has been Satan's trick since he worked it worked it first on Eve is just to disbelieve a little bit of the word that's right can you say Amen so then what we want to do is say God clean out all the channels amen Purge us from this unbelief Purge us from doubt purges from all of these things to where we can live in an atmosphere of Faith Can you say Amen it's true now every one of us as I said are free moral agents then being that we are free moral agents you know God made us to be amateur creators and the prophet told us that did not change because man since since because man fell amen man is still an amateur creat it's in your power everybody say it's in my power I know we we want to lean on government but we we're in an age that man everybody wants to blame their problems on somebody else everybody wants handouts everybody wants this and everybody wants that and everybody wants this you understand what I'm saying but it will never you'll never stand before God and say God I just didn't have a chance you didn't bless me enough how many how many's been blessed of God I all I can say is if God never blesses us again from this day forward he never answer your pray prayer he never gives you what you desire he never gives you nothing else anymore you are the Most Blessed people on the face of the Earth and you would never be able to come to God and say God you just didn't love me you just didn't offer it to me you just didn't give it to me no God has given it to us and he still gives it to us he still pours His blessings out but we have we are amateur creat creators right we are can you say Amen so being that we're amateur creators what did the prophet say we the one that create the atmosphere we got to create the atmosphere and sometimes sometimes we got to do like David did and said you know where he said I just encouraged myself in the Lord that's right create an atmosphere no there there might not be everybody patting you on the back and everybody comforting you and and every you might be just like job that have his comforters and they you know they come to comfort him and they were blaming him what an atmosphere but job would not succumb to them to that type of atmosphere he knew he had done everything according to what God required of him can you say Amen Lord so now we will either live in an atmosphere of life or we'll live in an atmosphere of death we will live or die by the kind of atmosphere we create can you say amen I know and and maybe this is a little different but I hope it helps you amen you know uh uh you know we can say well I'm predestinated you know it's kind of like what brother brandham said you know so well you know if I'm predestinated then you know what's the use of trying or you know I I can just live any way you know he said well it just shows that you you ain't got it yet you understand what I'm saying there's something you know well it doesn't the Bible say it is God which worketh both in you to Will and to do according to his good pleasure it's God which worketh in you both to Will and to do according to his good pleasure can you say Amen so so then you know we we we have to be REM minded of these things because Satan comes on every front and and to be honest we're living in such an age of negativity everybody is complaining Everybody Talks negative everybody it it just seems everywhere you go somebody's complaining about something and that Spirit can get on us to where we just have this woe is me and and I just don't know and if we don't you understand what I'm saying and I understand a lot of times we can't see the outcome of things but we take God at his word and we refuse to come in the atmosphere of unbelief yes that's right you love the Lord amen now for us we have the power to create yes either atmosphere amen because the word has been restored to us yes we were born uh defeated yes we come speak into this world speaking lies carnal nature yada yada but you don't have to stay that way amen our future is bright Hallelujah because the word has been restored therefore the seed of God that is within us can fully develop in what God has ordained and you say amen I won't take much longer but I do want to say this be cautious of the atmosphere you create be cautious of the the atmosphere you create because it will not only affect you but it will affect all of those who come under your influence can you say amen amen now church if you know we talk about winning soap we talk about all that well first of all get the right atmosphere because when people come under your atmosphere you're either going to kill them destroy them uh uh uh uh well you you can stump the growth you can you can limit their faith into healing or you can bring in into an atmosphere where they blossom in God to where they become stronger in the promises of God believing the promises of God can you say Amen see so so now now notice brother Brown said you get an atmosphere where people are disbelieving fussing and stewing among one another arguing about whether they belong to this church or that you'll never hatch out Christians you'll hatch out church members but not Christians because a Christian is born under the right atmosphere a Christian develops under a right atmosphere can you say amen that's right we we got to have this right atmosphere true and that's what makes a church sterl that's what makes our own life sterl sometimes is if we're living in the wrong atmosphere we're we're radiating an atmosphere see so now our home our our home now church it's not only important to have an atmosphere in the church you you got to have an atmosphere in the home that's it's so important yes sir because Satan just does not fight us just in church he fights us on every front he fights us at home that's true can you say Amen so if we're not careful we have the Rome atmosphere in it in the home worrying come complaining yeah being nervous talking defeat entertaining things that we should not entertain watching things listening to things that we should not be uh uh doing see and so therefore we ought to really really really watch the atmosphere that we're creating amen that's right I pray that God helps me to be an at be a blessing to my wife you know I and my children amen why well how can you do that I mean you know yeah we're we're husband and wife so blessing her with what you know uh a kitchen set or a blessing her with this blessing her with that no them them are fine and I think we should show our love in in expressing and we all got different ways of expressing things but to be a blessing we're talking about spiritual here is to where I I want my wife to prosper in God I want my children to prosper in God I want you to prosper in God are you with me now I I I know that that that you know you husbands when you go out to work you you you you might be got your mind on the job and all that well Satan's over there entertaining your wife and entertaining things at at at the home and then we come home we're Gra we're just this we're just that and we're you understand what I'm saying or we're listening to things that we shouldn't be we're on on the internet constantly and and and Satan is is Ravishing maybe your children's mind your wife's mind or whatever and we might think well well what about me well sometimes if we're are the leader we've got to stand at the post of Duty and remember it's our job to create an atmosphere in that home we got to create the atmosphere you Mama's got to do that yourself with your children but it's creating an atmosphere can you say Amen now brother Ram talks about it he says sometimes when I'm in the home and the wife people in and out and just going all the time I'd go in and stand wife standing there wiping her eyes crying she said Bill children hasn't had a bite to eat today the house is packed in Jam there is Sarah my little 2-year-old sitting in there she's crying Rebecca's come in from school why my wife is all nervous has got that atmosphere there see that's what it is see that nervousness that come upon on her now is starting to create an atmosphere and the children are feeling it everybody's feeling it right so he says now I don't tell her and she's not here tonight so she don't know it so I go and I say well I tell you honey that's true I said oh I have come you know I have to come home once in a while you know and but I say sweetheart you you you know to kindly get her quietened then I in my heart I say now Lord I'm giving my love of God into my wife now Lord you help me now here and I want your spirit now Satan would get us all confused see but I want you to help me yeah right now now brother brandom could have encouraged that atmosphere that was already going you know and sometime hey I'm guilty I think I think we could all raise our hands at one point or another and say we know how to push buttons we know how to feed the atmosphere you know and and and and and so but but here brother brandom is showing us that that if we could recognize that it's not just it's not the wife just just going haywire it's it's not just the children need to shut up Satan is working and he's trying to create an atmosphere to bring confusion didn't you say Amen so here he is he's praying he says now Satan will get us all confused but I want you to help me and I say dear I'll help you wash the dishes I I get on there and I say now you just start with the children like say something there see other words you help the children I'm gonna do this see and and I'm standing there all the time praying now Lord send your Holy Spirit I I know it's quing them right now and I'm sending it into sending it in this home my home in the name of your son Jesus and the first thing you know the wife says you know I'll she should' be interested in talking about something the baby's got blocks of playing in there going on it's all over Satan was defeated because a child of God knew how to create another atmosphere Lord God help us amen see it's the atmosphere you got to get away from it from that Old confusion oh I'm going to be he said you're scared and scared will create an atmosphere that will destroy you fear destroy brings an atmosphere brings an atmosphere that Satan thrives in he said that's why what's the matter he said you'll be frying your meat of the morning for breakfast and the first thing you know you're filled with the Holy Spirit he said I'm going to shock you a little bit you don't mind do you he said all right for instance the meats are frying and all at once the grease pops out on your hand now he said if you'll just shake it off and go on frying meat it wouldn't bother you he said now I know you didn't get it just right see see now he's talking about the the power of an atmosphere and he says I know you didn't get it just right he said the first thing we say oh where's that you know that unine or whatever he said see grab your hand it scares you to death and that's what does it it's fear Peter walking on the water he was walking all right till he seen the waves contrary and he got scared and Jesus said why did you fear that's what's the matter with Holy Ghost filled people today they got a lot of afraid the devil is just trying to scare you out of something he'll tell you ain't got a bright future he's trying to scare you tells many people they cross the line of Mercy he's trying to scare you CU if he can get you to create an atmosphere to where he can Thrive can you say Amen in that atmosphere he'll torment you in that atmosphere he'll destroy you in that atmosphere he'll bind you to where you can't even cry out to God can't even lift your hands anymore because it's an atmosphere people have lived in such an atmosphere of of fighting and confessing and gossip and just their Spirits so tore up for so long they don't even know what victory is anymore it's because they lived in an [Music] atmosphere right you love the Lord amen so he said see he said the devil's just trying to scare you out of something he's trying to put something off somewhere else and say well some of these days you'll be this no you are now everybody say I am now now we are the sons of God now we're seated together in Heavenly places now we have all powers in heaven and earth now see we have it not in the Millennium we won't need it then we got it now right now we are the sons of God and it does not yet appear what we shall be but we know we'll be like him amen and what you are here is a reflection of what you are somewhere else and those who he called he justifies is that right those who he justified he is glorified already in the presence of God we have a glorified body let that be your atmosphere I don't know what time it is but if musicians will come brother Bram said was you ever around someone that you just love to be around said you've had those people what is it it's because of their atmosphere that they created around them you you've been around nice people but yet you couldn't stand to be around them it's their atmosphere other place do you realize that you're sons of God the atmosphere and the air that you live in you create a situation around you that either draws or pushes away we create that that situation around us can you say Amen another place I've seen people that you just couldn't get away from them you just loved them and there's something drawing about them it's because they live in that atmosphere they live under the power of the Holy Spirit praise the Lord oh my you love the Lord see we're we're called to be a people that when Satan tries to come in and create Havoc we can we can stand there and create the right kind of atmosphere till it breaks his power right it brother Brown say you just keep believing create that atmosphere say that again you just keep believing create the atmosphere ain't that right just keep believing Satan said well you just confession is all in vain well you just you know your prayers are all in vain you just keep believing just keep believing you're going You're creating an atmosphere just keep believing amen your your children are coming home create the atmosphere just keep believing that your spouse is going to get saved you create the atmosphere just keep believing you're going to get well create the atmosphere can you say Amen keep believing that you're going to go in Rapture that you are a son of God a daughter of God keep believing that God is for you regardless of what you feel create the atmosphere you're going to come to your full development do Hallelujah isn't that wonderful now church it's harvest time it's harvest time that means we're coming to full development as Sons and Daughters of God we're not just sitting here like vagabonds God doesn't look at you as a vagabond we shouldn't act like Vagabond we shouldn't we shouldn't talk like Vagabond we shouldn't talk like poppers amen your father owns everything and you are Heirs of it we must believe and create the atmosphere and we come into that full potential amen see brother Brown said it's the atmosphere that brings forth the product if you want your children say he create the [Music] atmosphere right and then he says it's the spirit of God that conditions the atmosphere and he said what we need is a holy ghost atmosphere an atmosphere where the power of God's a moving one Accord one place gathered together under that atmosphere of expecting God to move down and do signs and wonders let's move oursel up into that bracket Step Up in that faith believing [Music] expecting not saying well and I know I've been guilty just as much I just don't think things are going to change I just don't think you know whatever I just don't we're talking the devil's lie talking to the devil's lie well I I just don't know I I just I might fall apart and I I just don't know about tomorrow well he's already said he's taking care of tomorrow [Music] don't worry about tomorrow create an atmosphere of Faith you believe it yes sir now church we see what is taking place in the world today we got the driverless cars we've got woman rising in power Israel's fighting for her survival Russia is threatening World War II I don't know if you've been in the news here lately that they're threatening the United States that you better you better tell Afghanistan or whoever to back off says there is no limit to us we will we will start nuclear war and say you want World War III we'll bring it on ain't just threats either but we already know these things are going to happen we already know see the church we see it in its condition everything is happening falling all the Pu the the pieces of the puzzle is coming together and we know the Rapture can happen any moment any moment [Music] now can I ask you this what has brought it to this condition what's brought it the world and all of that to the end time what where are we at why well brother brandham lets us know why he says it's the atmosphere the people have created the right kind of Atmosphere for it he said see the atmosphere is charged up for an atomic bomb for judgment it's the atmosphere Russia would have couldn't have do it until the atmosphere was right right brother Terry but the atmosphere is right look at the world today look at the situation we're a Godless Nation it's a Godless world the atmosphere is right but he said the church is getting ready for a Rapture we're waiting anticipation waiting we ain't got our head wrapped up in politics ain't got our head wrapped up in materialistic things we're creating an atmosphere for him to come Hallelujah the church is waiting for the coming of the Lord he said we cannot have the last day until the people gets in the spirit of the last day he said just like we can't have a healing service until people gets in the spirit of healing service cannot have a feeling of the Holy Ghost until people gets in that kind of atmosphere see well the people was in the atmosphere in that day speaking of Noah and lot see in that day to bring judgment upon the Earth and they're in the same atmosphere today eating drinking marrying and given in marriage and all this thing kind of thing like that and the glory of God is being preached and demonstrated in the power of the Holy Ghost setting forth an example of the resurrection of Jesus Christ that's going to take the church into Glory just as sure as I'm just as certain as I'm standing here and men are ignoring it paying no attention to it and walking away from it because they're in the spirit of the last days but the world's got to get like this God would be unjust to pour His wrath out upon just people they've ignored him and walked away and Satan's captured them and there they're standing in that time and here we are today but church just as much as they're getting in an atmosphere they're creating an atmosphere now you know that's true you know it it's so hard to witness to people anymore to get them to believe the reality of this message because there's such an atmosphere of unbelief there's such an atmosphere of religion that's hard to penetrate the soul anymore and give them the truth of the message of this hour can you sayen it seemed like politicians it seems like doctors it seemed like the media it seems like all of this this this voices has more effect upon the people than the gospel of today why because they're in that kind of atmosphere but brothers and sisters we are living in an atmosphere where the word of God has more effect than the news media than a politician than than anything else we're in an atmosphere for the word of God to penetrate our soul do you believe that oh my can you lift your hands unto the Lord and worship him oh God we love you we love you father we love you Lord may we create that atmosphere Lord may we never disbelieve your word may we doubt our doubts oh God hallelujah help us father oh bless this people bless the church Lord we go through so many things father but Lord we know that you're with us we know Lord may we not give in to despair may we not give in to worry may we not give in to nervous and anxiety may we not give in to unbelief Lord hallelujah it may seem like things are getting worse out in the world and in our homes or whatever it may be but Lord may we create that atmosphere and just stand upon your word we thank you Father we love you Lord hallelujah hallelujah amen what's up song oh I'm no longer a slay to fear I am a child of God now you unravel me with the Melo you surround me with a song of deliverance from my enemies till all my
