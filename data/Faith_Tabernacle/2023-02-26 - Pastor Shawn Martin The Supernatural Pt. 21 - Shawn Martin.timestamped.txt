[43:36] perfect way uh and he wants pictures of
[43:40] it too so he said if that tin is sagging
[43:43] it's your fault not mine
[43:46] well that really puts pressure on us huh
[43:48] and uh so anyways but we're really
[43:51] excited about it and and looking forward
[43:54] to what God has in store
[43:56] amen but the uh the book of Ephesians
[43:59] the first chapter
[44:02] and before we go into the word may we
[44:04] just bow our heads and
[44:07] talk to the author of the word
[44:10] father
[44:12] as we come your children
[44:16] whom you have redeemed Lord
[44:19] you've expressed your love to us
[44:22] father and you've done that work of
[44:24] redemption and you've kept us
[44:27] all through our lives Lord even when we
[44:30] didn't even know it was you Lord
[44:34] and Father Here we are now a work of
[44:37] your hands and we're here to express our
[44:40] love back to you
[44:42] just to tell you thank you and how we
[44:45] love you and
[44:47] we make so many mistakes in this human
[44:50] body Lord we fight so many things Lord
[44:54] but down in our heart
[44:57] there's always something that has
[44:59] stabilized this Lord or something has
[45:02] drawn us even to this day today to come
[45:04] and worship
[45:06] it wasn't buyer wheel power it was it
[45:09] was a divine order of God
[45:12] we just say thank you
[45:14] and Lord we just asking that you would
[45:18] move Among Us this morning
[45:20] father if you've called us together then
[45:23] you've got an
[45:24] eternal purpose for it
[45:26] and Lord now that we yield ourselves to
[45:29] you
[45:29] we pray that you would use the Mortal
[45:31] lips Lord here and help me to get myself
[45:34] out of the way and
[45:36] God pray that you had helped the people
[45:39] just to get themselves out of the way
[45:42] and anoint their ears and hearts to hear
[45:44] and receive
[45:45] we ask these things in your gracious
[45:48] name Jesus Christ and the church says
[45:52] amen
[45:55] Ephesians the first chapter in the 22nd
[45:58] verse
[46:00] says then hath put all things under his
[46:02] feet and of course speaking of Christ
[46:05] and gave him Christ to be the head over
[46:09] all things to the church
[46:11] which is his body
[46:14] the fullness of him
[46:16] that filleth all in all
[46:19] a man you can have your seats this
[46:22] morning
[46:25] praise the Lord
[46:27] I want to just continue along the lines
[46:30] we've been talking about and
[46:33] and I believe that the the body of
[46:36] Christ is the most powerful thing on
[46:39] Earth today
[46:41] it is made up of people all around the
[46:44] world
[46:46] and it's a universal body
[46:50] and I thank the Lord that
[46:54] the blood has a way and it's so powerful
[46:57] that it could reach all kinds
[47:00] of humanity
[47:03] and
[47:04] John actually sees this there in the
[47:07] Book of Revelations he saw a great
[47:09] multitude which no man could number
[47:12] of all nations of All Peoples tongues
[47:16] kindreds amen and this is the body of
[47:21] Christ
[47:22] and this is the Fulfillment of the
[47:27] prophecy that God said to Abraham
[47:29] in Genesis 17 and 4.
[47:34] where God says as for me behold my
[47:37] Covenant is with thee and thou shalt be
[47:41] a father of many nations
[47:44] and later on or in another place God
[47:49] tells Abraham I will make thy seed
[47:52] as the sand of the sea which cannot be
[47:57] numbered for multitude
[47:59] and so here John
[48:02] in being caught up and he sees this he
[48:06] said I see this people there which no
[48:09] man can number
[48:10] from All Nations tongues kindreds
[48:13] peoples
[48:15] and so uh you see for Abraham to be a
[48:19] father he had to have a seed
[48:21] and God said that he would have a seed
[48:25] and that every promise of God that He
[48:30] gave Abraham
[48:31] he would give it to his seed as well
[48:34] it'd be to Abraham and his seed
[48:39] and so just to read some scriptures
[48:42] Genesis 13 and 14 and the Lord said to
[48:46] Abram after that lot was separated from
[48:49] him lift up now thine eyes and look from
[48:53] the place where thou art North northward
[48:56] Southward Eastward and Westward for all
[49:00] the land which thou seeest to thee will
[49:02] I give it
[49:03] and to thy seed forever
[49:07] and I will make thy seed as the dust of
[49:10] the earth so that if a man can number
[49:13] the dust of the earth then shall thy
[49:15] seed also be numbered
[49:17] occur arise walk through the land in the
[49:20] length of it and in the breath of it for
[49:23] I will give it unto thee
[49:25] Genesis 17 7 and I will establish my
[49:29] Covenant between me and thee and thy
[49:31] seed after thee in their generations for
[49:34] an Everlasting Covenant to be a god unto
[49:37] thee and to thy seed after thee and I
[49:41] will give unto thee and to thy seed
[49:43] after thee the land wherein thou art a
[49:47] stranger all the land of Canaan for an
[49:50] everlasting possession and I will be
[49:52] their God and God said unto Abram
[49:55] Abraham Thou shalt keep my Covenant
[49:58] therefore thou and thy seed after thee
[50:02] in their generations and this is my
[50:04] Covenant which you shall keep between me
[50:07] and you and thy seed after thee every
[50:10] man child among you shall be circumcised
[50:14] and then Genesis 22 and 16 by myself I
[50:19] have sworn saith the Lord for because
[50:21] thou has done this thing and has not
[50:23] withheld thy son thine only son that in
[50:26] blessing I'll bless thee and in
[50:28] multiplying all multiply thy seed as the
[50:31] stars of the heaven and as the sand
[50:33] which is upon the seashore and thy seed
[50:37] shall possess the Gate of his enemies
[50:40] and in thy seed shall all the nations of
[50:43] the earth be blessed because thou Hast
[50:46] obeyed my voice so we we understand that
[50:50] the seed it it's it the promises belong
[50:53] to Abraham and his seed after him which
[50:55] seed is The Offspring and so in the
[50:59] natural we we talked about it last
[51:01] Sunday but in the natural Abraham had uh
[51:04] uh several children he had the Ishmael
[51:07] he had Isaac and then he had several
[51:09] after Isaac and and yet there was only
[51:14] one uh uh that God would establish his
[51:19] Covenant with and that was with Isaac
[51:23] and and here in Genesis 17 19 and God
[51:27] said Sarah thy wife shall bear thee a
[51:30] son indeed and thou shalt call his name
[51:33] Isaac and I will establish uh with my
[51:38] Covenant with him for an Everlasting
[51:41] Covenant and with his seed after him
[51:44] amen so so Isaac was the Seed of Abraham
[51:49] potentially but he wasn't the real Seed
[51:54] of Abraham in what God was speaking of
[51:59] uh uh we find that Isaac was the natural
[52:02] seed that God had established his
[52:05] Covenant with and and brother Brown said
[52:08] see not in the rest of the Jews but in
[52:11] Isaac in Isaac and that that that that
[52:14] that matters now not not in all Seed of
[52:17] Abraham but in Isaac would would God
[52:20] establish a covenant with uh and in
[52:24] Romans 9 and 7 it says neither because
[52:27] they are the Seed of Abraham are they
[52:29] all children
[52:30] see uh uh but in Isaac everybody's
[52:33] saying Isaac shall thy seed be called
[52:36] not not in all the children of Abraham
[52:39] but in Isaac shalt and thy seed be
[52:42] called and so it was through Isaac that
[52:45] Christ uh came uh which was the true
[52:49] Seed of Abraham amen that that's right
[52:52] see and so I uh Christ uh he was the
[52:56] royal Seed of Abraham he was the the
[52:58] supernatural seed of of Abraham but but
[53:03] just looking at the natural for a moment
[53:05] we even see predestination uh in the
[53:08] natural seed that God established his
[53:10] Covenant with uh for example Jacob and
[53:14] Esau uh they were the Dirac sons of
[53:17] Jacob so they were the direct
[53:20] descendants of Jacob they were uh twins
[53:24] of the natural seed ain't that right but
[53:27] then we read there in Romans 9 and 11
[53:30] the children
[53:31] being not yet born neither having done
[53:35] any good or evil that the purpose of God
[53:38] according to election might stand not of
[53:41] works but of him that clawless
[53:44] it was said unto her the Elder Shall
[53:46] Serve the younger as it is written Jacob
[53:49] have I loved but Esau have I hated so if
[53:54] you notice Esau had the birthright for
[53:58] he was the firstborn the Bible tells us
[54:00] that there was actually between the two
[54:03] babies the two boys were wrestling in
[54:05] the mother's womb
[54:07] and and Esau came out of the womb first
[54:10] and Jacob
[54:12] was holding on to Esau's Hill
[54:16] and and he come out of the womb as well
[54:19] and so uh uh but the the firstborn had
[54:24] the birthright ain't that right and so
[54:27] the word Birthright I just looked it up
[54:29] and we could go more into that but I
[54:31] won't today but it's it's a right a
[54:35] Birthright is a right a privilege or
[54:38] possession to which a person is entitled
[54:42] by birth
[54:44] so the birthright always laid to the
[54:48] firstborn uh son the firstborn son and
[54:52] and so the eldest child received the
[54:55] inheritance now the others may have had
[54:58] a blessing but the inheritance belonged
[55:01] to that first child uh the first son and
[55:04] so the wrestling that was going on uh uh
[55:09] continued it was it went in the womb but
[55:12] it also continued outside the womb Jacob
[55:16] wanted that Birthright
[55:19] now he knew he couldn't get the
[55:21] birthright because he wasn't the eldest
[55:23] but he still wanted it
[55:25] and and now
[55:28] as the prophet tells us that that is the
[55:31] type well here it is brother Brown said
[55:33] it's the spiritual man today and
[55:35] spiritual woman that's elected
[55:38] predestinated of God to come to eternal
[55:41] life if they have to sell everything
[55:43] they got if they have to take their name
[55:45] off of every Church book in the nation
[55:48] they still want that Birthright
[55:51] see it's the only thing that matters to
[55:54] them
[55:54] I I I I I I I I I I think that's the way
[55:58] it is here this morning
[56:00] uh uh is is that's all that matters is
[56:03] the birthright it's the only thing that
[56:05] matters to them just get that Birthright
[56:08] that's all no matter how and what level
[56:11] they have to come on if they have to get
[56:14] down at the altar and cry and boo hoo if
[56:17] they have to run through the places and
[56:19] go back and make things right and sell
[56:21] what they've got or give away everything
[56:23] they have and become a pilgrim and a
[56:26] stranger it doesn't matter they want the
[56:30] birthright that's all they're interested
[56:33] in is the birthright and he says now
[56:35] don't blame them people you can't blame
[56:38] Jacob you you can't blame the people of
[56:41] today they cannot help it
[56:44] they were predestinated to that they
[56:47] were elected to it ain't that right so
[56:50] so now Jacob represents uh uh you and I
[56:54] today that really wants the birthright
[56:56] we you know what you you just we can't
[57:00] be happy with anything else amen we find
[57:04] that there's no Greater Joy than to walk
[57:06] with God we find that there's no Greater
[57:09] Joy than to know our savior we find that
[57:13] there's no other Joy than to to have the
[57:17] Seal of the Holy Ghost Upon Our Lives we
[57:20] find that there's no other Joy than to
[57:22] have the approval of God upon us can you
[57:25] say amen amen because that's all we were
[57:28] born for that's what we were
[57:30] predestinated for it's funny how we'll
[57:33] give up uh certain jobs and and good
[57:36] money just so we can be at church and
[57:38] and we'll give up things of the world so
[57:40] we can just have uh uh peace with God
[57:44] and and know that we're walking
[57:46] according to God's ways ain't that right
[57:48] amen and and the world don't understand
[57:50] that but you can't blame us because
[57:52] that's what we were predestinated for
[57:55] amen I've thought of many times brother
[57:57] Bram said I'd rather live under a bridge
[57:59] eating soda crackers or crackers and
[58:02] soda drinking soda water or Branch water
[58:04] or whatever than to have all of this
[58:06] other stuff in the world and know that
[58:08] I'm walking with God Amen well I believe
[58:11] that's every in elect of God because
[58:13] that's what we were predestinated for
[58:15] take my house take my cards take my take
[58:19] my money take whatever as long as I'm
[58:22] walking with God that's all that matters
[58:25] amen well now this is what Jacob he
[58:28] wanted that Birthright and he got it now
[58:31] now now not so not only did Jacob
[58:34] represent us a man by wanting the
[58:37] birthright but he also represented Us in
[58:40] that he got it and so will this bride
[58:44] get it the birthright belongs to you and
[58:48] you'll stop at nothing to get it you're
[58:50] going to go through your trials you're
[58:51] going to go through your headaches
[58:53] you're going to go through your your uh
[58:55] turmoils and you'll watch friends go
[58:57] you'll watch family go you'll watch
[58:59] everybody else go amen because they're
[59:02] interested in everything else amen but
[59:04] the birthright is what we want and we'll
[59:07] get it
[59:09] it's just that way Jacob got it and so
[59:11] will this bride and so and this bride's
[59:14] got it
[59:15] amen so we find he got it and and notice
[59:19] how I got it now Genesis 25 and 29 and
[59:23] Jacob Assad pottage
[59:25] and and what that was is he boiled some
[59:28] vegetables there uh or or it could have
[59:31] been mixed with meat and and and and
[59:33] things like that and made a soup and and
[59:36] so well then it says and Esau came from
[59:39] the field and he was faint he was
[59:42] starving I'd I don't know you know he
[59:44] was a hunter so you think he would have
[59:46] shot him a deer or something but uh uh
[59:49] to eat but but when he met Jacob he was
[59:52] starving and to the point he thought he
[59:55] was going to die
[59:56] you know if I miss a meal sometimes I
[59:58] think I'm gonna die too but I don't know
[1:00:01] how far he had to have gone uh uh you
[1:00:04] know five days a month I don't know it
[1:00:06] could have been an hour but anyway and
[1:00:09] Esau said to Jacob feed me I pray thee
[1:00:13] with that same red pottage for I am
[1:00:16] Thane therefore was his name called the
[1:00:20] Edom and notice how Jacob he's a he's a
[1:00:23] smart dude he's a conniver you we all
[1:00:25] know about Jacob but one thing he won
[1:00:27] that Birthright right so he didn't care
[1:00:29] what he was going to do he didn't care
[1:00:31] how he got it he just wanted the
[1:00:33] birthright so here's Jacob now he's just
[1:00:35] been a little tough on Esau and he says
[1:00:38] I tell you what I'll give you some if
[1:00:40] you give me your Birthright that's what
[1:00:42] I want sell me your Birthright right
[1:00:45] now you know Jacob I mean good night
[1:00:48] Esau was the Hunter he would have said
[1:00:51] well skip you I'll just go ask Mom for
[1:00:53] something
[1:00:54] he must have been you know miles away
[1:00:56] from home I don't know but uh uh but
[1:00:59] anyways he said Jacob said sell me this
[1:01:02] day thy Birthright and Esau noticed the
[1:01:06] attitude notice what he says he says
[1:01:09] behold I'm at the point to die
[1:01:14] what prophet
[1:01:16] good Lord
[1:01:18] what prophet shall this Birthright do to
[1:01:21] me
[1:01:23] now do you realize that Jacob or Esau
[1:01:26] having that Birthright it on only went
[1:01:28] to him it went to his family
[1:01:32] it went to his children
[1:01:35] what a selfish individual
[1:01:41] my opinion
[1:01:43] and Jacob said swear to me this day
[1:01:47] and he swear unto him and sowed his
[1:01:50] Birthright unto Jacob
[1:01:52] so then you notice now Isaac has no idea
[1:01:57] the father has no idea what just
[1:01:59] happened
[1:02:00] now Jacob comes for the birthright to
[1:02:02] get a blessing
[1:02:04] and his mom's in on this now
[1:02:06] right and she looked the Bible says that
[1:02:08] Isaac loved Esau Rebecca loved Jacob
[1:02:14] so Jacob was a mama's boy
[1:02:17] and so Rebecca got in on this to deceive
[1:02:22] Isaac
[1:02:23] so she told Jacob what to do you know
[1:02:27] because he saw was hairy he had a lot of
[1:02:29] hair so they went and killed some uh
[1:02:32] whatever they killed and put skin on
[1:02:35] Jacob's arms and whatever so he'd be
[1:02:38] Harry
[1:02:39] he saw must have really been hairy
[1:02:42] but this was the case and so we find
[1:02:46] that when Jacob appeared he says to eat
[1:02:50] Isaac he says I'm I'm Esau lying right
[1:02:53] there I'm Esau but he don't care he
[1:02:55] wants that Birthright that's all he
[1:02:57] wants
[1:02:57] so I'm I'm Esau and I want I've come for
[1:03:01] my blessing and Jacob you know Esau was
[1:03:04] well come here you know and let me feel
[1:03:06] you because he's blind Isaac is blind so
[1:03:09] he's fiddling around and he's rubbing
[1:03:11] all that hair you know and he says well
[1:03:14] he says this is you're the voice of
[1:03:15] Jacob but man that's the that's the arms
[1:03:18] of Esau you know so he's a little
[1:03:21] confused but but regardless he he took
[1:03:23] it as Esau right so here's the blessing
[1:03:26] Genesis 27 and 28 therefore God give
[1:03:30] thee God give thee of the Dew of Heaven
[1:03:33] and the fatness of the earth and plenty
[1:03:37] corn of corn and wine let people serve
[1:03:41] thee
[1:03:42] and Nations bowed down to thee be Lord
[1:03:47] over thy Brethren what a Birthright and
[1:03:50] let thy mother Sons bow down to thee
[1:03:53] curse be everyone that curseth thee and
[1:03:57] blessed be he that blesseth thee
[1:04:00] do you know that still stands today for
[1:04:03] the natural Seed of Abraham
[1:04:06] now Jacob's name actually went in from
[1:04:09] Jacob a conniver to Israel
[1:04:11] a prince with God and so that's why the
[1:04:14] Jews are called Israel is after their
[1:04:16] father Abraham
[1:04:18] and that still stands today that those
[1:04:21] that bless Israel will be blessed now
[1:04:25] that's just a natural Covenant that's
[1:04:26] just enough but see that belonged to
[1:04:28] Esau
[1:04:30] that belonged to Esau and he despised it
[1:04:34] good grief
[1:04:36] you know what he's Charles children
[1:04:38] became
[1:04:39] thieves
[1:04:40] and robbers
[1:04:43] that's the effect that Esau had on his
[1:04:47] family by turning this thing down
[1:04:51] he thought that he was going to die so
[1:04:53] what is it going to do me didn't even
[1:04:55] think about his children didn't even
[1:04:56] think about the grandchildren he didn't
[1:04:57] even think about his future gender the
[1:04:59] generations after him
[1:05:01] but thank God there's a Jacob
[1:05:04] and said if you ain't wanting it I'll
[1:05:05] take it I want it and because he he was
[1:05:09] able to stay for that Birthright and
[1:05:12] obtain that Birthright his seat after
[1:05:14] him was blessed
[1:05:16] I think that's pretty powerful did you
[1:05:19] know the prophet said nothing
[1:05:20] Supernatural happened in Esau's life
[1:05:22] nothing
[1:05:24] even though he was religious
[1:05:27] yet nothing happened in eso's life he
[1:05:31] didn't have a Birthright
[1:05:34] gave it up and God says I hate him for
[1:05:37] it but how many people give up their
[1:05:39] Birthright today
[1:05:42] that they'll take a better job they'll
[1:05:45] they they want better retirement they
[1:05:47] want every and they disregard the
[1:05:49] Supernatural and the spiritual part of
[1:05:51] of their lives
[1:05:54] and don't realize it'll affect their
[1:05:56] families down the road
[1:05:58] you may not have much in life but you
[1:06:01] stay with God
[1:06:04] ain't that right because it'll be a
[1:06:06] blessing to your children it'll be a
[1:06:08] blessing to your Offspring down the road
[1:06:12] sure will you say well I mean my
[1:06:15] children's gone Haywire it does not
[1:06:17] matter you walk with God you have to
[1:06:20] write over that devil you have right
[1:06:22] over sin you have more Authority amen
[1:06:25] over yours your your Offspring than the
[1:06:28] devil does
[1:06:31] and you say man
[1:06:33] amen now so so we we find that that Esau
[1:06:37] rejected the birthright and in Hebrews
[1:06:40] 11 and 8 Paul uh in speaking of Abraham
[1:06:44] said by faith he's sojourned in the land
[1:06:47] of promise as in a strange country
[1:06:49] dwelling in Tabernacles with Isaac and
[1:06:53] Jacob The Heirs with him of the same
[1:06:56] promise
[1:06:58] it was Jacob that's mentioned as the
[1:07:01] heir of the same promise not Esau
[1:07:04] ain't that right heir of the same
[1:07:07] promise and Esau is not even mentioned
[1:07:10] as being an heir of the same promise can
[1:07:12] you say man
[1:07:14] so this tells us that in Isaac the seed
[1:07:18] was not secure
[1:07:22] Esau come out of Isaac
[1:07:25] but he was not secure
[1:07:29] see only in Christ
[1:07:32] everybody say only in Christ The Royal
[1:07:35] seed are we secure
[1:07:39] um and you say man
[1:07:41] amen Isaac couldn't help what he's all
[1:07:44] done
[1:07:45] and yet coming out of that natural
[1:07:47] lineage God says I hate him
[1:07:50] ain't that right
[1:07:52] coming out of a natural lineage of Isaac
[1:07:55] that it showed that Isaac was not the
[1:07:58] real seed that God was talking about
[1:08:02] he was speaking of Christ
[1:08:06] can you say Amen we find out that of the
[1:08:09] two and a half million people that left
[1:08:11] Egypt they all died in the wilderness
[1:08:13] except for two Joshua and Caleb ain't
[1:08:16] that right and and yet they were they
[1:08:19] were Israelites amen they come out of
[1:08:22] Egypt they they they they they were
[1:08:24] walking to the promised land and and and
[1:08:26] yet the the uh uh Jesus said about the
[1:08:31] rest of all of them that come out says
[1:08:33] they're everyone dead ain't that right
[1:08:35] and we know what dead death represents
[1:08:38] it it represents separation and and
[1:08:40] brother Rams said see there they are
[1:08:43] eternally dead
[1:08:45] eternally separated ain't that right yet
[1:08:47] they a lot of them come out of the
[1:08:49] lineage of Isaac and yet only two made
[1:08:52] it of the original made it into the
[1:08:54] Promised Land
[1:08:55] ain't ain't that right yes sir see and
[1:08:59] and so be it they're eternally dead amen
[1:09:02] so the promise wasn't guaranteed in
[1:09:05] Isaac's ability to bring forth seed
[1:09:10] ain't that right you see it's never been
[1:09:12] in the natural as to what man can do God
[1:09:15] has never looked at the natural ability
[1:09:19] God don't care what you can produce God
[1:09:22] don't care what you can sum up God don't
[1:09:25] care about your ability God don't care
[1:09:27] about your willpower God don't care
[1:09:30] about your talents
[1:09:32] can you say Amen what talents can you
[1:09:35] give Amen to to bring to God Amen that
[1:09:38] would Elevate you up closer to him
[1:09:41] what is there anything to do with you a
[1:09:44] man that you can present to God that
[1:09:46] would cause him to love you even more
[1:09:51] can you say man so it's never been in
[1:09:54] the natural Amen brother Brown said the
[1:09:56] natural Siege failed because it accepted
[1:09:59] the law instead of the word of Grace
[1:10:01] aren't you glad for Grace
[1:10:04] we'll stay with Grace same ain't that
[1:10:06] right but they failed that natural seed
[1:10:09] failed amen because they accepted the
[1:10:12] law over the word of Grace a man see and
[1:10:15] and again the prophet says the promise
[1:10:18] was not only made to Abraham but he is
[1:10:20] seed not his seed Isaac for it failed
[1:10:25] and proved it did
[1:10:28] can you say man look at what happened
[1:10:30] when the net what what did the natural
[1:10:32] seed do when Christ The Royal Seed of
[1:10:35] Abraham came to the Earth They Crucified
[1:10:38] him
[1:10:39] the natural seed can you say man but yet
[1:10:42] the the natural seed boasted to Jesus
[1:10:45] they they boasted about being the Seed
[1:10:48] of Abraham and notice Jesus has replied
[1:10:51] to them in in John 8 35 says I know that
[1:10:55] you are Abraham's seed but you seek to
[1:10:57] kill me because my word my Covenant has
[1:11:00] no place in you
[1:11:03] ain't that right
[1:11:04] it has no place in you and in 40 the
[1:11:07] 44th verse he says you are of your
[1:11:10] father the devil and the lust of your
[1:11:12] father you will do ain't that right amen
[1:11:15] see and and so it showed amen that that
[1:11:18] that there was a a greater significance
[1:11:21] amen uh uh than just being I succeed
[1:11:26] amen see they they were part of the seed
[1:11:29] amen but Jesus identified their father
[1:11:31] as of the devil amen and we've got a
[1:11:34] greater father amen than Isaac was
[1:11:39] we've got a greater father
[1:11:41] amen that's right so Israel the the
[1:11:45] Jewish people are the natural seed of
[1:11:48] Isaac or natural Seed of Abraham and
[1:11:51] brother Brandon says in Israel in Isaac
[1:11:54] Israel in Isaac failed keep that in mind
[1:11:58] Israel in Isaac failed and denied the
[1:12:02] genuine seed when it come on ain't that
[1:12:05] right and so their works showed that
[1:12:08] they were really the children of the
[1:12:10] devil amen see you think of it now also
[1:12:14] just speaking in in the natural sense
[1:12:17] um uh uh in the Old Testament God uh
[1:12:20] told David that he would give him a son
[1:12:23] amen and and that he would not uh uh he
[1:12:28] would never leave him without a a seed
[1:12:31] and that that his son the son of David
[1:12:34] was to sit on the throne ain't that
[1:12:37] right and his and David's Throne would
[1:12:40] be established forever amen that's right
[1:12:43] see but but and it looked to be like it
[1:12:46] was Solomon it looked like Solomon was
[1:12:49] the promised one but we found out that
[1:12:52] Solomon wasn't the promised one it was
[1:12:54] actually Christ Christ was the true son
[1:12:58] of David ain't that right see the
[1:13:00] natural seed of David was Solomon and he
[1:13:03] looked to be the seed but the prophet
[1:13:05] said he backslid just like the Seed of
[1:13:08] Abraham did see so so when Christ was
[1:13:12] there he told them a greater than
[1:13:14] Solomon is here before you ain't that
[1:13:17] right he was there proven a greater than
[1:13:20] Solomon Christ was that greater than
[1:13:23] Solomon and he was proven to them that
[1:13:26] he was the real seed of David
[1:13:28] ain't that right so Not only was he the
[1:13:31] genuine Seed of Abraham he was the
[1:13:34] genuine seed of David that had the
[1:13:37] promise
[1:13:38] yes sir it's all in Christ he's the heir
[1:13:42] ain't that right
[1:13:43] amen so so Isaac was the Lesser son the
[1:13:47] prophet said of Abraham and so was
[1:13:49] Solomon the Lesser son of David amen see
[1:13:53] uh uh but God has never looked at the
[1:13:57] natural man is the one that looks at the
[1:14:00] natural oh God help us to get our eyes
[1:14:02] off the natural amen you can't find
[1:14:05] fulfillment in the natural amen and and
[1:14:08] even if it you say well I've got a good
[1:14:10] job I've got good pay I've got I've my
[1:14:13] family's done good don't you look at the
[1:14:15] natural and then because he can change
[1:14:17] in a moment you might be saying well all
[1:14:19] hell is broken loose and and and and and
[1:14:22] and and and and just just I I'm so
[1:14:24] devastated I don't know what to do I
[1:14:26] don't know how to uh which way to turn
[1:14:28] which way to go which way to look don't
[1:14:30] you look at the natural amen God never
[1:14:33] looked at the natural
[1:14:36] he never looked at inability and he
[1:14:38] never looked at the abilities
[1:14:40] he looked at his word
[1:14:42] can you say Amen
[1:14:44] yes sir he always looks to his word amen
[1:14:47] you can't save yourself you can't help
[1:14:50] yourself and I've just met it this way
[1:14:52] you can't get God to hate you and you
[1:14:54] can't get God to love you more
[1:14:57] it's all within himself
[1:15:01] then you say Amen if he ever loved you
[1:15:03] he's always loved you and there ain't
[1:15:05] nothing that you can do to deter that
[1:15:08] you know why he loves you because you're
[1:15:10] all the faults and all the failure you
[1:15:12] still want to Birthright
[1:15:14] you steal one God
[1:15:18] that's right
[1:15:21] didn't want my children the other day I
[1:15:22] don't care I don't care what it takes
[1:15:24] even if I go to hell I don't want this
[1:15:27] world
[1:15:28] I don't want nothing
[1:15:30] God never answers another prayer it
[1:15:32] don't matter to me I just want him
[1:15:35] I'm happy where I'm at
[1:15:37] I'm happy to know him I'm happy to know
[1:15:40] this message
[1:15:41] and I want to know it more
[1:15:46] can you say man
[1:15:48] so God it's man that looks at the
[1:15:50] natural but you know the natural is
[1:15:53] nothing but a product of man's labors
[1:15:55] man builds an altar man builds a
[1:15:58] denomination man establishes Creeds and
[1:16:00] dogmas man is the one that erects the
[1:16:03] temples and and Tabernacles and and and
[1:16:05] man comes to the place that he's really
[1:16:08] thinks he's a chief something
[1:16:12] is that right
[1:16:13] but if you notice when God ever used the
[1:16:17] natural
[1:16:19] it was always he used it to foretell of
[1:16:23] something greater
[1:16:24] when God uses the natural he always used
[1:16:27] testifies of something greater to come
[1:16:30] ain't that right
[1:16:31] yes sir so we we find that that's what
[1:16:35] happened God had them to build a natural
[1:16:37] altar but it testified of the greater
[1:16:40] altar to come
[1:16:41] he had them to build a natural Mercy
[1:16:44] Seat but it only testified of a greater
[1:16:47] mercy seat that was to come God had them
[1:16:49] to kill a natural lamb in the Old
[1:16:52] Testament but it only testified of a
[1:16:54] greater lamb to come can you say man God
[1:16:57] bless the natural seed but in that
[1:16:59] natural seed while blessing them it only
[1:17:01] testified of the greater seed to come
[1:17:04] amen they they the natural seed
[1:17:06] conquered amen but it only showed and
[1:17:09] testified of a greater conqueror to come
[1:17:12] of a greater people that would conquer
[1:17:14] greater things amen than them can you
[1:17:17] say amen amen that's right and I say to
[1:17:20] you a greater than that natural seed is
[1:17:22] here today a greater than Solomon a
[1:17:25] greater than Abraham now greater than
[1:17:27] David a greater amen than Ruth is here
[1:17:30] today a greater than Esther is here
[1:17:33] today
[1:17:36] the natural when God uses the natural it
[1:17:40] always brings them testifying of
[1:17:42] something to come
[1:17:43] can you say Amen now amen God told Moses
[1:17:46] to erect a natural Tabernacle amen but
[1:17:49] there was a Greater Tabernacle
[1:17:51] Hallelujah and Moses saw that Tabernacle
[1:17:55] so every time as I said Wednesday night
[1:17:57] every time he showed up at that natural
[1:17:59] Tabernacle he was thinking of a Heavenly
[1:18:01] Tabernacle amen why man can't get past
[1:18:04] the natural there are a people that
[1:18:06] could look past that natural and see the
[1:18:09] real I believe they saw a real bride to
[1:18:11] come
[1:18:12] God used a natural Boaz to tell us that
[1:18:15] there's a a real Boaz and church were
[1:18:18] not tied to a natural Boaz we are tied
[1:18:21] to the real greater than Boaz
[1:18:25] oh
[1:18:35] remember
[1:18:37] God had Abraham to kill a sacrifice
[1:18:41] and to cut it in half
[1:18:45] and he took
[1:18:47] he took these three animals
[1:18:49] the Bible speaks of and he cut them
[1:18:51] apart
[1:18:54] and he laid them piece by piece
[1:19:00] and we all know the story
[1:19:02] when they made a covenant
[1:19:04] they would take it and take an animal
[1:19:07] and they would kill it and then they
[1:19:08] would cut it in half
[1:19:12] in the Old Testament
[1:19:14] and then the two that was making that
[1:19:16] Covenant
[1:19:18] they would stand between that dead
[1:19:19] animal
[1:19:22] and they would make their agreement and
[1:19:24] then then they'd say
[1:19:26] let our body be as this dead sacrifice
[1:19:30] if we don't fulfill our end of the
[1:19:32] bargain
[1:19:36] the two had to come together
[1:19:39] if you read where God made that Covenant
[1:19:41] with Abraham
[1:19:43] he put Abraham to sleep
[1:19:47] and the Bible says that pillar fire
[1:19:48] walked between both of them both the
[1:19:51] sacrifice
[1:19:53] showing that he was not only going to
[1:19:55] fulfill his part but he was going to
[1:19:56] fulfill our part
[1:19:59] how more guaranteed can the Covenant be
[1:20:03] to you and I
[1:20:05] God's the one that promised he will
[1:20:06] fulfill it
[1:20:08] Abraham you have nothing to do with it
[1:20:09] your seed has nothing to do with it I'll
[1:20:11] tell you what Abraham I've already done
[1:20:13] it it's already been done you were
[1:20:15] chosen before the foundation of the
[1:20:17] world I elected you I called you you are
[1:20:20] already not just Justified you're
[1:20:22] glorified
[1:20:23] you've already got it at the office do
[1:20:25] you realize you already got a theophany
[1:20:26] waiting on you on the other side
[1:20:29] when the prophet went across the the the
[1:20:31] the curtain of time he said I saw every
[1:20:33] one of you there I don't believe he was
[1:20:34] just talking about that group of people
[1:20:36] there I believe he was talking about the
[1:20:37] Seed of Abraham and I just had just
[1:20:40] happened to believe I was part of that
[1:20:42] amen I can't explain everything I I
[1:20:44] don't understand everything but all I
[1:20:46] know is I am there I was there my
[1:20:49] theophany is calling me
[1:20:52] how can it be it's a finished work
[1:20:57] ain't that right but notice Abraham had
[1:21:00] cut he had cut them sacrifices now he
[1:21:03] was waiting for the next the next um uh
[1:21:07] commission if you want to say
[1:21:09] so God told him do that cut the
[1:21:12] sacrifices so he cut it he laid it out
[1:21:14] there
[1:21:15] and he waited and he waited and he
[1:21:17] waited and while he was waiting the
[1:21:19] buzzards were flying around
[1:21:22] and he would come tried to land on that
[1:21:25] sacrifice and Abraham would be over
[1:21:28] there shooing them off
[1:21:30] showing them off well it took a profit
[1:21:32] to get that spiritual significance of
[1:21:35] that amen he shoot him off and brother
[1:21:38] Brahm said it was a type everybody say
[1:21:40] it was a type of Abraham's seed not in
[1:21:44] in the Old Testament not in the new in
[1:21:46] the New Testament so to speak in the
[1:21:48] Bible days amen but in this last day
[1:21:52] natural Abraham doing a natural action
[1:21:56] shoeing the natural birds off was only
[1:21:59] testifying of a greater people to come
[1:22:01] and it would testify of his seed in the
[1:22:04] last day casting out Devils from the
[1:22:07] sacrifice casting them from away from
[1:22:10] the sacrifice can you say Amen so
[1:22:13] Abraham was not typing out his natural
[1:22:15] seed for his natural seed failed they
[1:22:19] failed to keep unbelief off of the word
[1:22:22] amen and when the pure word came in to
[1:22:25] them the real son of man they crucified
[1:22:28] him with their unbelief the buzzards of
[1:22:31] unbelief amen possessed them and they
[1:22:33] kept they didn't keep it away like their
[1:22:35] father Abraham did can you say Amen but
[1:22:38] he wasn't typing out that natural seed
[1:22:41] they accept the law overground over
[1:22:43] Grace over the word of Grace ain't that
[1:22:45] right and so is it that Abraham was not
[1:22:48] typing the natural Church of today
[1:22:51] because they're doing the same thing
[1:22:53] that the natural Seed of Abraham did
[1:22:55] they're letting all the buzzards of
[1:22:56] unbelief come upon the word to where
[1:22:58] they preached nothing but die a dogmas
[1:23:01] and Creed they've taken the supernatural
[1:23:03] out of the Bible amen they don't even
[1:23:05] believe in anything anymore
[1:23:09] so he wasn't typing out the natural seed
[1:23:11] he wasn't typing the natural church so
[1:23:14] natural If Abraham was typing out the
[1:23:16] rule seed of today a man who is standing
[1:23:19] true brother Brown said casting out
[1:23:21] Devils doing great signs and wonders
[1:23:24] getting all the unbelief from the word
[1:23:26] of God keeping the sacrifice clean
[1:23:29] keeping the word holy keeping it
[1:23:31] reverence not putting anything with it
[1:23:33] and adding anything to it just keeping
[1:23:35] it away standing on guard letting
[1:23:38] nothing touch it
[1:23:42] so natural Abraham by doing that was
[1:23:45] typing you
[1:23:47] and die today
[1:23:49] of keeping that word clean
[1:23:51] keep it all unbelief out
[1:23:53] can you say Amen
[1:23:55] Hallelujah that's right so the natural
[1:23:58] lamb was just a substitutionary until
[1:24:02] Christ came
[1:24:04] the natural altar was substitutionary
[1:24:06] till Christ came the high priest was
[1:24:10] substitutionary till Christ came Isaac
[1:24:13] brother Brown said Bing after the flesh
[1:24:15] was only substitutionary until Christ
[1:24:18] came
[1:24:20] Solomon being after the flesh it was
[1:24:23] only super uh uh substitutionary until
[1:24:26] Christ came ain't that right amen I hope
[1:24:29] this is okay Galatians 3 16 now to
[1:24:32] Abraham and his seed were the promises
[1:24:35] made
[1:24:36] oh my but we're not looking at it now as
[1:24:40] well God bless Israel God bless Israel
[1:24:43] we we're just going to try to make it
[1:24:45] God bless Israel no no look what Paul
[1:24:48] says and to see and he saith not to
[1:24:51] seeds as of many but as of one everybody
[1:24:55] say one
[1:24:56] which is Christ and divine seed which is
[1:25:02] Christ
[1:25:03] see the the natural seed Isaac the
[1:25:06] natural man Isaac yes he had a blessing
[1:25:09] and yes in in his lineage come Jacob and
[1:25:12] David and and and uh Moses and and
[1:25:16] whoever else down to that lineage and
[1:25:19] look what God done through them in a
[1:25:21] supernatural way amen but they were only
[1:25:24] testifying of what this seed would do of
[1:25:27] what you would do so you could look back
[1:25:29] no wonder brother random kept using
[1:25:31] these testimonies of the Hebrew boys and
[1:25:34] and Daniel and the Lion's Den he
[1:25:36] constantly referred to the the stories
[1:25:38] of the Old Testament amen that you could
[1:25:40] identify that if they could do it you're
[1:25:42] the greater it was only a testimony if
[1:25:45] God could spare and save and rescue and
[1:25:48] redeem a natural seed he can save you as
[1:25:52] well
[1:25:58] to thy seed
[1:26:00] so Christ was the spiritual seed
[1:26:05] that the promise was made through
[1:26:09] and he come through Abraham's Faith the
[1:26:11] faith of Abraham
[1:26:14] and the lineage of people would come
[1:26:16] through that seed
[1:26:21] think of your lineage
[1:26:28] a lineage of people would come to that
[1:26:30] seed roll seed
[1:26:33] which would make Abraham a father of
[1:26:37] Nations
[1:26:38] amen
[1:26:40] and it's that lineage of people
[1:26:43] that make up the body of Jesus Christ
[1:26:49] amen
[1:26:52] in this Gentile dispensation
[1:26:56] that's what is making up the body of
[1:26:58] Christ
[1:26:59] now Christ was the spiritual seed
[1:27:03] that would be the son of David
[1:27:06] that would establish David's Throne
[1:27:09] forever
[1:27:10] God establishes David's Throne by the
[1:27:15] son of David which is Jesus Christ
[1:27:20] and if I can say it this way you're part
[1:27:22] of that royalty
[1:27:26] not by being the natural seed Solomon's
[1:27:30] Dead and Gone
[1:27:31] he did not establish David's Throne
[1:27:34] forever
[1:27:36] so I'm glad I'm not part of that lineage
[1:27:40] but I am part of a lineage of a real
[1:27:42] seed
[1:27:43] which is the son of David
[1:27:45] and I will reign with him
[1:27:48] you're going to reign with him
[1:27:50] and not not only will you you are now
[1:27:53] how else could you defeat the devils how
[1:27:56] else could you defeat sin how else could
[1:27:59] you conquer it's through the ruling
[1:28:01] you're ruling over this body
[1:28:07] Christ is the seed of the woman that
[1:28:10] brews the Serpent's head
[1:28:12] Christ is the Seed of Abraham that
[1:28:14] possessed the Gate of his enemy
[1:28:16] and Christ is the seed of David that is
[1:28:19] to Reign on the throne
[1:28:21] but if you notice he was not a product
[1:28:24] of Abraham's labors
[1:28:27] he was not in according to the flesh
[1:28:29] he was not a product of David's labors
[1:28:32] after the flesh
[1:28:35] for he was not born after the flesh
[1:28:38] brother Brown said he was not born by
[1:28:40] natural birth but was born by a
[1:28:43] supernatural birth
[1:28:45] can you say man how how did this
[1:28:47] Supernatural seed come about
[1:28:49] through a supernatural birth
[1:28:52] yes Sarah see so and and that happened
[1:28:55] by the supernatural faith of Abraham
[1:28:58] Abraham believed Jacob believed David
[1:29:02] believed and you see Christ in David you
[1:29:05] see Christ in Abraham you see Christ in
[1:29:08] Isaac you see Christ all the way down
[1:29:10] through the linear until he became a a a
[1:29:13] a a human being the fullness of Christ
[1:29:16] the fullness of God in human flesh can
[1:29:19] you say Amen now we know brother Brown
[1:29:21] says faith is Supernatural everybody say
[1:29:23] faith is Supernatural faith is
[1:29:26] Supernatural and it does Supernatural
[1:29:28] things
[1:29:29] just think of that now the faith of
[1:29:31] Abraham produced Christ
[1:29:34] the supernatural faith of Abraham
[1:29:39] produced a supernatural God made flesh
[1:29:43] and you say man Romans 4 13 for the
[1:29:46] promise that he should be heir of the
[1:29:49] world was not to Abraham or to a seed
[1:29:52] through the law but through the
[1:29:55] righteousness of faith so the faith of
[1:29:59] Abraham produced Jesus Christ
[1:30:03] now notice his faith Abraham Paul says
[1:30:06] who against hope believed in hope that
[1:30:09] he might become the father of many
[1:30:11] nations
[1:30:13] all the tests that Abraham went through
[1:30:17] that the trials that Abraham went
[1:30:19] through but his faith stood
[1:30:21] and against all hope he believed in Hope
[1:30:24] do you see what your faith is doing and
[1:30:27] what he's going to produce you say well
[1:30:29] I ain't got nothing I've talked to my
[1:30:31] loved ones and and I might my daughter
[1:30:33] or my son my husband my wife and and I
[1:30:35] ain't get nowhere amen then don't depend
[1:30:38] upon your natural abilities your faith
[1:30:41] your faith can you say Amen it'll
[1:30:44] produce the supernatural every time
[1:30:51] now notice the faith Seed of Abraham
[1:30:55] that he believed God's word everybody
[1:30:57] say believe God's word
[1:30:59] regardless
[1:31:00] of what the circumstances was
[1:31:03] now I just gonna be honest now as I've
[1:31:05] been studying this my faith has been
[1:31:07] tried
[1:31:08] and and and you know this morning I just
[1:31:10] I just told the Lord Lord help my faith
[1:31:14] I helped my faith to be strong
[1:31:16] if there's anything else amen I I'm not
[1:31:19] asking for much of anything of you I
[1:31:21] just want my faith to be right
[1:31:23] can you say Amen foresee he believed
[1:31:26] God's word regardless of what the
[1:31:28] circumstances was there you are who he
[1:31:32] says see you know I feel like shouting
[1:31:34] look see look the faith Seed of Abraham
[1:31:37] what was it not Abraham's body but
[1:31:41] Abraham's faith
[1:31:42] your faith will produce the supernatural
[1:31:45] your faith will bring Christ upon the
[1:31:47] scene
[1:31:49] Abraham's faith in what the word of God
[1:31:52] no matter what come he called anything
[1:31:55] contrary to it as though it wasn't there
[1:31:59] his body was weak and it got weaker but
[1:32:01] he never considered it so Sarah's womb
[1:32:04] was dead and it was more dead than it
[1:32:06] ever had been before but he had never
[1:32:08] considered it he looked at the promise
[1:32:10] and considered God's faithful that gave
[1:32:13] the promise
[1:32:17] and you realize it's in Christ
[1:32:21] that all the promises are sure
[1:32:25] the promises in Christ are sure to all
[1:32:29] you believe that
[1:32:31] yes sir notice second Corinthians 1 20
[1:32:34] for all the promises of God everybody
[1:32:37] say all the promises of God
[1:32:40] in him
[1:32:42] are yea and in him amen unto the glory
[1:32:47] of God by us ain't that right all the
[1:32:50] promises not some promises but all the
[1:32:53] promises of God are are in him yea and
[1:32:57] in him amen in Christ ain't that right
[1:33:00] now notice now because this to me has
[1:33:03] something special amen Ephesians 1 3
[1:33:06] blessed be the God and father of our
[1:33:08] Lord Jesus Christ who hath blessed us
[1:33:10] with all spiritual blessings
[1:33:15] in Heavenly places in Isaac
[1:33:19] in Christ
[1:33:21] according as he hath chosen us in
[1:33:26] him who Christ before the foundation of
[1:33:30] the world not Isaac we were not chosen
[1:33:33] in Isaac
[1:33:34] we were chosen in Christ we were not
[1:33:39] predestinated to be part of that natural
[1:33:41] lineage we were predestinated to be part
[1:33:44] of the supernatural lineage
[1:33:46] and every blessing is is ours he has
[1:33:50] blessed us with all spiritual blessings
[1:33:53] in Christ
[1:33:56] that we should be holy and Without Blame
[1:33:59] before him in love
[1:34:05] having predestinated us unto the
[1:34:08] adoption of children
[1:34:10] by who Isaac
[1:34:14] Jesus Christ
[1:34:16] oh my
[1:34:19] so not by Isaac the natural
[1:34:23] but by Jesus Christ the supernatural
[1:34:27] the Royal seed
[1:34:28] now the Bible tells us that there's
[1:34:30] going to be a bride without spot wrinkle
[1:34:32] or blemish
[1:34:33] that promise could not be guaranteed in
[1:34:36] Isaac
[1:34:40] the promise of the manifestation of sons
[1:34:43] of God for this last day could not be
[1:34:47] guaranteed in Isaac
[1:34:49] the promise that Jesus gave the works
[1:34:52] that I do shall you do and greater than
[1:34:54] Works than these shall you do could not
[1:34:56] be guaranteed in Isaac
[1:35:01] is that right
[1:35:02] only in Christ
[1:35:04] now God told Abraham that his seed
[1:35:09] Bill Brown said would be coming from the
[1:35:12] dust of the Earth
[1:35:14] to the Stars
[1:35:16] in heaven
[1:35:18] he said see we humbly bow our heads down
[1:35:22] our thoughts and our thoughts
[1:35:24] and we looked at where we came from from
[1:35:26] the dust of the earth of sand
[1:35:29] and then we look up to heaven
[1:35:32] and see where we're going to be what
[1:35:33] we're going to be and what we are where
[1:35:36] we're going it's it's to be the shining
[1:35:38] stars in the heavens can you say man
[1:35:42] yes sir see see Genesis 22 17 Again
[1:35:46] breaking in in blessing I Will Bless
[1:35:48] thee and in multiplying I will multiply
[1:35:50] thy seed as the stars of the heaven and
[1:35:53] as the sand which is upon the seashore
[1:35:55] oh my look look at the the the the the
[1:35:58] when Rebecca got on the camel to go meet
[1:36:01] Isaac watch what listen to what her
[1:36:03] family says to her Genesis 24 60. I'll
[1:36:07] break it in and they blessed they
[1:36:08] blessed Rebecca and said unto her Thou
[1:36:11] Art our sister be thou the mother of
[1:36:13] thousands of Millions
[1:36:15] brother Brown said you know what that
[1:36:17] was that's bringing in the Gentiles
[1:36:21] they didn't even know what they were
[1:36:22] prophesying sister Martha but they were
[1:36:24] prophesying of us
[1:36:26] be thou the mother of Millions
[1:36:30] and let thy seed possess the Gate of
[1:36:32] those which hate them
[1:36:34] can you say amen and I'm going to be
[1:36:36] honest with you as long as there is a
[1:36:39] Seed of Abraham remaining there is going
[1:36:41] to be a people that is possessed in the
[1:36:43] gate of their enemy
[1:36:44] I understand we're living in a dark evil
[1:36:47] age and it's Satan is running running
[1:36:49] rampant around destroying homes
[1:36:52] destroying people's minds destroying
[1:36:54] Nations amen he's having his Heyday but
[1:36:57] there's one people that he is limited to
[1:36:59] and that is the Seed of Abraham for they
[1:37:02] will possess him and not him possessing
[1:37:06] them let the trouble come but we are the
[1:37:08] possessor Amen Let the depression come
[1:37:11] but we are the possessor let the
[1:37:13] sickness and Jesus diseases come but we
[1:37:16] are the possessor
[1:37:18] when it comes to the bride of Christ
[1:37:20] when it comes to that rule Seed of
[1:37:22] Abraham Satan is limited
[1:37:29] you realize the blessings are still even
[1:37:31] with natural seed
[1:37:35] we've been watching a series of
[1:37:37] documentary
[1:37:41] in the evening times
[1:37:43] well a couple nights we have about
[1:37:45] Israel
[1:37:47] and talking about the last day or The
[1:37:50] Six Day War
[1:37:52] and talking about all kinds of wars
[1:37:56] and the man
[1:37:57] that is in doing the interview he he
[1:37:59] tells at the beginning of this series
[1:38:01] I'm not a believer
[1:38:04] I don't believe in miracles
[1:38:06] and he gives his explanation as to why
[1:38:09] he don't believe in it and all that
[1:38:12] he said after talking to these people
[1:38:15] I've come to realize that there has to
[1:38:18] be something different more
[1:38:21] than this human
[1:38:23] coincidences or whatever just
[1:38:24] paraphrasing
[1:38:26] and so here is a natural seed and do you
[1:38:29] realize
[1:38:30] one man a Jew said
[1:38:33] most Israel are secular
[1:38:36] don't even believe in God
[1:38:41] do you realize Israel the Bible actually
[1:38:43] calls Jerusalem what the city of
[1:38:47] homosexuals or uh
[1:38:49] Egypt and Sodom
[1:38:52] they are the homosexual capital of the
[1:38:55] world
[1:38:57] is Jerusalem
[1:38:59] or Tel Aviv
[1:39:01] they have their hate you know their
[1:39:03] celebrations and all that for the homos
[1:39:08] right in Israel
[1:39:10] natural seed
[1:39:12] but see God's kept a covenant with
[1:39:13] Israel
[1:39:19] I wish you could all go watch the
[1:39:21] documentary
[1:39:23] and and the stories
[1:39:25] is is beyond
[1:39:27] it's it's incredible to where you have
[1:39:30] to realize there was something more
[1:39:32] Supernatural and even those that were
[1:39:34] agnostic and said hey I don't believe in
[1:39:36] God or I didn't some of them even said
[1:39:38] they were they're older now and and
[1:39:41] they're given the testimony says I
[1:39:43] didn't believe in God
[1:39:44] but now I've come to the conclusion
[1:39:46] there had to be something that was
[1:39:49] watching us
[1:39:52] you see that that Covenant Still Remains
[1:39:54] with natural Israel
[1:39:56] and you know why because he already
[1:39:59] promised in the Book of Revelation
[1:40:00] there's going to be 144 000 come out of
[1:40:02] there
[1:40:03] that he will seal but he can't seal them
[1:40:07] until he's finished with you and I
[1:40:10] hello now now we we know that the world
[1:40:13] Second World War II and Hitler and all
[1:40:16] of his demonology and possessions and
[1:40:19] all that amen and what they've done to
[1:40:21] Israel and all the nations turned
[1:40:23] against Israel
[1:40:24] Israel was seeking
[1:40:27] um what what what would be the word they
[1:40:29] were seeking refuge in other nations and
[1:40:31] even America turned her down
[1:40:33] there was one ship that had 200 and some
[1:40:36] Jews uh uh up on on the ship and they
[1:40:40] would not no Nation would let her dock
[1:40:43] they stayed there for days out in the
[1:40:45] ocean and they all they all finally
[1:40:46] drowned the ship just sunk but but no
[1:40:50] Nation everybody turned their back upon
[1:40:52] the Jews
[1:40:54] but the prophet now gave us an Insight
[1:40:57] it was the tender hand of Jehovah
[1:41:00] driving the people back to their
[1:41:02] Homeland they had to be in their
[1:41:04] Homeland because God doesn't deal with
[1:41:06] Jews as as individuals he deals with him
[1:41:09] as a nation
[1:41:10] and here it was impossible for them to
[1:41:13] be a nation there was Egypt there was
[1:41:14] Iraq there was uh the Palestinians and
[1:41:17] all them Nations around there if you
[1:41:19] look on the map and see how small Israel
[1:41:21] is compared to everything else and all
[1:41:23] these nations amen were were gunning
[1:41:26] them uh for them and told them you will
[1:41:29] never be a nation they said we didn't
[1:41:31] even have artillery we didn't have
[1:41:33] nothing
[1:41:35] and yet here we stand today and they
[1:41:37] begin to tell of accounts that is
[1:41:40] incredible amen here with some Jewish
[1:41:42] soldiers amen that that that that that
[1:41:43] was there and here come hundreds of
[1:41:46] Palestinians or or what did Jordan
[1:41:48] Jordanian uh coming up and they knew
[1:41:51] they knew that they were going to be
[1:41:53] killed they knew that and and uh uh so
[1:41:57] they were given their last wishes to
[1:41:58] each other and and all that and and he
[1:42:01] said when they got up there they
[1:42:02] actually the jordanians saw that group
[1:42:04] and they said there they are and they're
[1:42:06] getting rerun to them and all of a
[1:42:07] sudden they backed up and they started
[1:42:08] looking and and and and and looking up
[1:42:10] in the heavens and they took off running
[1:42:12] they all fled
[1:42:20] what just happened you know and and and
[1:42:23] and they they were able to capture one
[1:42:25] of them uh uh uh one of them boys got
[1:42:27] captured and they asked him why did you
[1:42:29] run they said you didn't see it there
[1:42:30] was Angels there we saw uh we we saw a
[1:42:33] God or uh Abraham father father of
[1:42:36] Abraham and the angels all around
[1:42:41] now if he is going to do that to a
[1:42:43] natural seed what will he do to a rise
[1:42:48] oh I hope you understand you cannot fail
[1:42:52] the natural seed fell but you cannot
[1:42:55] fail
[1:42:56] because you didn't come from Isaac you
[1:42:57] come from a Royal Sea you wasn't born of
[1:43:00] a natural lineage you was born by a
[1:43:02] supernatural lineage a supernatural
[1:43:04] birth the same birth
[1:43:06] the same word that begat Christ also
[1:43:08] begot you
[1:43:10] how can you fail
[1:43:16] you love him
[1:43:19] yep can't fail
[1:43:21] and as long as there's a seed
[1:43:27] the gates of the enemy going to be
[1:43:28] possessed
[1:43:30] you realize
[1:43:32] amen
[1:43:34] the guarantee
[1:43:36] comes by being in Christ
[1:43:39] and we are the promised
[1:43:41] everybody say we are the promise
[1:43:43] We Are The Promise Christ was the
[1:43:46] promise seed
[1:43:47] right
[1:43:49] now now you you know
[1:43:52] foreign
[1:43:53] you know that when you go plant a seed
[1:43:57] the seed abides alone
[1:43:59] unless it dies and rot in the ground
[1:44:02] but if it does die it bringeth forth
[1:44:04] much fruit
[1:44:05] right
[1:44:07] where do the apples come from from a
[1:44:08] seed
[1:44:11] Not seeds as of many
[1:44:13] but one seed
[1:44:15] right
[1:44:17] and so when God was looking for a a a a
[1:44:20] a super race
[1:44:23] he couldn't rely up on the natural seed
[1:44:26] so he brought his own seed
[1:44:29] ain't that right when he was looking for
[1:44:31] a body
[1:44:33] that would represent him on Earth
[1:44:37] he he couldn't rely upon a natural seed
[1:44:40] because every one of them failed
[1:44:42] but he could rely upon the seed that he
[1:44:45] would produce
[1:44:46] now you're the fruit of that seed
[1:44:49] which is Christ for he chose us as we
[1:44:52] read he chose us in him before the
[1:44:55] foundation of the world so how did you
[1:44:57] get here him
[1:44:59] go ask the Appleseed I had to go ask the
[1:45:02] Apple off the apple tree how did you get
[1:45:03] here he would point you down to the seed
[1:45:05] down in the and in the in the earth and
[1:45:07] say I came from it
[1:45:10] you got your Origins Church
[1:45:12] and your origin isn't a denomination
[1:45:14] your origin isn't just your good looks
[1:45:17] your origin isn't from anything natural
[1:45:20] your origin came from Christ
[1:45:24] can you say man oh that's all right now
[1:45:27] did you know that God testified of us
[1:45:30] Gentiles being the heir of Promise of
[1:45:33] Abraham in the Old Testament
[1:45:35] he promised it now it's amazing just how
[1:45:39] little significant things
[1:45:42] that happen testify
[1:45:45] of a greater
[1:45:47] now in Genesis
[1:45:49] 48
[1:45:51] this is dealing with when Joseph brought
[1:45:55] his two sons
[1:45:56] and I'm not going to keep you much
[1:45:58] longer but he brought his two sons
[1:46:00] Ephraim and manessa before his father
[1:46:03] Jacob
[1:46:04] Jacob was old he was going to die
[1:46:08] and so he brought his two sons Ephraim
[1:46:11] and manessa manessa being the oldest
[1:46:14] Ephraim being the younger son
[1:46:16] and he brought him to Isaac or did Jacob
[1:46:19] to be blessed ain't that right so
[1:46:23] Genesis 48 8 and Israel beheld Joseph's
[1:46:26] Sons Israel Jacob remember his name was
[1:46:29] changed from Jacob to Israel and Israel
[1:46:31] beheld Jacob's sons and said who are
[1:46:34] these and Joseph said unto his father
[1:46:36] they are my sons whom God hath given me
[1:46:38] in this place and he said bring them I
[1:46:41] pray thee unto me and I will bless them
[1:46:43] now the eyes of Israel Jacob were dimmed
[1:46:47] for age so that he could not see and he
[1:46:50] brought them near unto him and he kissed
[1:46:52] them and embraced them and Israel said
[1:46:55] unto Joseph had not I had not thought to
[1:46:58] see thy face and lo God has shown me
[1:47:01] also thy seed
[1:47:04] and Joseph brought them his two boys out
[1:47:08] from between his knees and he bowed
[1:47:11] himself with his face to the Earth
[1:47:14] notice the position that Joseph brings
[1:47:17] his boys places them and Joseph took
[1:47:20] them both Ephraim being the younger uh
[1:47:23] in his right hand uh toward Joseph
[1:47:27] Israel's left so in other words he
[1:47:30] brought the younger boy to Jacob's left
[1:47:32] hand so he could bless him like this and
[1:47:35] he brought manessa over here to Jacob's
[1:47:37] right on Jacob's right hand
[1:47:40] and so uh um we find that that uh it
[1:47:45] says in Israel stretched out his right
[1:47:47] hand and laid it on ephraim's head
[1:47:53] who was the younger and left and his
[1:47:56] left hand up on Vanessa's hand guiding
[1:47:59] his hands wittingly for manessa was the
[1:48:03] firstborn
[1:48:04] so Manasseh should have received the
[1:48:07] birthright
[1:48:10] and this was this is why Joseph the
[1:48:13] right hand always means something
[1:48:16] Jesus sitting at the right hand of God
[1:48:19] it's Authority power
[1:48:21] and so he puts the firstborn Joseph puts
[1:48:24] that firstborn manessa at the right hand
[1:48:26] of Joseph so that he could put his right
[1:48:29] hand and bless the firstborn
[1:48:31] and put Ephraim the younger on Jacob's
[1:48:35] left
[1:48:36] right
[1:48:37] but then we find that Jacob or Israel
[1:48:42] placed his hand on the younger
[1:48:45] and his left hand on the odor
[1:48:52] and he blessed Joseph and and said God
[1:48:56] before whom my father's Abraham and
[1:48:59] Isaac did walk the god which fed me all
[1:49:02] my life long unto this day the angel
[1:49:04] which redeemed me from all evil blessed
[1:49:07] The Lads and let my name be named on
[1:49:10] them and the name of my father's Abraham
[1:49:13] and Isaac and let them grow into a
[1:49:15] multitude in the midst of the earth
[1:49:16] words are important the blessings were
[1:49:19] important
[1:49:21] and when Joseph saw that his father laid
[1:49:23] his right hand on the head of Ephraim it
[1:49:26] displeased him see because it he led it
[1:49:28] he put it on the younger and it did
[1:49:31] please displeased him and he held up his
[1:49:33] father's hand to remove it from
[1:49:35] ephraim's head and to put it on
[1:49:37] manasseh's head and Joseph said unto his
[1:49:40] father not so my father for this is the
[1:49:44] firstborn put thy right hand upon his
[1:49:46] head and his father refused and said I
[1:49:50] know it my son I know it he also shall
[1:49:52] become a people and he also shall be
[1:49:55] great but truly his younger brother
[1:49:58] shall be greater than he and his seed
[1:50:01] shall become a multitude of Nations
[1:50:04] the younger received the birthright
[1:50:11] so God was showing that the blessing
[1:50:15] would not come upon Israel the firstborn
[1:50:18] it would come upon us gentiles
[1:50:25] wouldn't come upon the natural seed it
[1:50:27] would come up on the Royal seat
[1:50:32] you say man now notice what brother
[1:50:34] Brown said about it Jacob started to
[1:50:36] bless Ephraim and manessa and when he
[1:50:38] started to put his hands he put uh on he
[1:50:42] put Ephraim on the right and Vanessa on
[1:50:45] the left to get the right hand blessing
[1:50:47] the oldest and when he started to pray
[1:50:50] his hands crossed and he gave the
[1:50:52] youngest one the right hand blessing
[1:50:54] instead of the one that was on the right
[1:50:55] hand see and Joseph said not so father
[1:50:58] you have put the blessing on uh uh uh
[1:51:02] Manasseh which again manessa actually
[1:51:04] was the oldest instead of Ephraim uh so
[1:51:08] brother bran just there but anyway he
[1:51:10] said Joseph said God or Jacob God has
[1:51:13] crossed my hands brother Brown said what
[1:51:16] it went from the Jews the oldest the
[1:51:19] first chosen of God through the cross
[1:51:21] coming back to the Gentiles to get the
[1:51:24] pride blessings come through the cross
[1:51:27] from the Jew to the Gentile see the Jew
[1:51:30] rejected the cross there 4 he got a
[1:51:33] gentile bride
[1:51:37] just to find it a long time ago look at
[1:51:39] the natural
[1:51:41] and they didn't even know what they were
[1:51:42] doing but the natural would Testify the
[1:51:44] greater
[1:51:50] Jacob another place Jacob when he
[1:51:52] brought his grandchildren between his
[1:51:54] knees when he put He when he was an old
[1:51:57] man Ephraim and manessa blessed those
[1:51:59] children see and in part of this them
[1:52:02] spiritual blessings that lasted even to
[1:52:04] this day how he crossed his hands from
[1:52:06] one to the other taking the blessings
[1:52:08] from the Jews to the Gentile at the
[1:52:10] cross another place Jacob crossed his
[1:52:13] hands and give the younger child the
[1:52:14] blessing and the two kids was added unto
[1:52:17] the 12 tribes which was only 10 at that
[1:52:20] time and he blessed them in Jacob
[1:52:22] himself and Joseph his prophet's son
[1:52:24] standing there said father you've done
[1:52:26] wrong and said you put your right hand
[1:52:28] blessing on the on on the young child
[1:52:31] where it ought to have went to the old
[1:52:33] and Jacob said but I know my hands was
[1:52:35] crossed but God has crossed them why
[1:52:38] Israel having the rights to be a bride
[1:52:41] rejected and sold their Birthright and
[1:52:43] it went from the old son Israel to a new
[1:52:46] amen Gentile and the blessings went from
[1:52:49] there through the cross to the bride
[1:52:51] another place transfer the life from
[1:52:53] anything to another thing if you take
[1:52:55] the life out of a pumpkin and put in a
[1:52:58] watermelon vine it would bear pumpkins
[1:53:00] exactly see you take the life out of a
[1:53:03] peach and put it in a pear it'll bear
[1:53:05] peaches see because the life that's in
[1:53:08] the tree gives the evidence of it and
[1:53:11] there is how the roll seed through Isaac
[1:53:14] come the natural seed that rejected but
[1:53:17] in the cross from Ephraim to manessa it
[1:53:20] was transferred the blessings from the
[1:53:22] right hand to the left or the left hand
[1:53:24] belong to the uh the left hand belong to
[1:53:27] the left the youngest to the Odyssey
[1:53:30] through there turn the whole situation
[1:53:32] from the natural seed of Isaacs which
[1:53:35] rejected Christ and the natural church
[1:53:37] today still rejects him but the
[1:53:40] spiritual Royal seed of God that
[1:53:42] believes the roll Seed of Abraham which
[1:53:44] believes every word of God there is a
[1:53:47] confirmation of a living Resurrection
[1:53:49] what did Jesus Christ in them
[1:53:54] God knew
[1:53:56] we were coming
[1:54:01] oh that's so exciting
[1:54:03] we were chosen in Christ
[1:54:06] not Isaac
[1:54:08] and you say man
[1:54:10] and Paul in Galatians 3 29 if you be
[1:54:13] Christ
[1:54:15] then you are Abraham's seed and heirs
[1:54:18] everybody say heirs according to the
[1:54:21] promise
[1:54:22] what happened it was at the cross
[1:54:24] that it turned from Jew to Gentile
[1:54:29] they had every right to be the bride
[1:54:31] but here you are today
[1:54:33] you had no rights to be bribed but by
[1:54:35] his grace
[1:54:36] you have the birthright
[1:54:38] and oh my God is with this bride
[1:54:42] ever more than ever
[1:54:44] he's with this bride do you love him in
[1:54:47] the wonderful if the musicians will come
[1:54:52] Hallelujah
[1:54:54] Ephesians 2 10 for we are his
[1:54:57] workmanship created in Jesus Christ
[1:55:00] unto good works not in Isaac not in
[1:55:03] David not in man
[1:55:06] in Christ
[1:55:08] second Timothy 1 and 1. Paul an apostle
[1:55:12] of Jesus Christ by the will of God
[1:55:14] according to the promise of life which
[1:55:17] is in
[1:55:19] Christ Jesus
[1:55:21] the promise of life
[1:55:23] eternal life
[1:55:24] in Christ Jesus the true seed
[1:55:28] oh do you love him
[1:55:31] amen you realize that the natural seed
[1:55:33] of Isaac of Abraham could not produce a
[1:55:36] super race
[1:55:37] an invincible Army
[1:55:39] but the seed of Christ could
[1:55:42] the seed the rules he did and here we
[1:55:45] are today
[1:55:46] we are of that Royal seed
[1:55:48] and notice now it was given to us in
[1:55:52] Christ see in the ninth verse who has
[1:55:55] saved us and called us with an holy
[1:55:57] calling not according to our works but
[1:55:59] according to his own purpose and Grace
[1:56:01] which was given us in Christ Jesus
[1:56:04] before the world began
[1:56:06] see and if you notice John 6 37 Jesus
[1:56:10] said this is the Father's will which
[1:56:12] hath sent me that all everybody say all
[1:56:15] which the father hath given me I should
[1:56:18] lose nothing
[1:56:20] hmm everyone that was chosen in Christ
[1:56:23] will be there they are the ones that are
[1:56:26] part of the body this is not an Esau and
[1:56:29] Jacob coming out of the same womb or uh
[1:56:32] the same seed and then one uh rejecting
[1:56:35] the birthright now I understand we that
[1:56:37] brother Brown typed out I'm typing out
[1:56:38] another thing here but if you are in
[1:56:41] Christ if you was chosen in Christ
[1:56:43] there's no other race that is chosen in
[1:56:45] Christ but the Bride of Jesus Christ can
[1:56:48] you say Amen we were chosen in Christ
[1:56:50] before the foundation of the world and
[1:56:53] in Christ he will not lose a one we will
[1:56:57] be there we will make it we will
[1:57:00] overcome
[1:57:01] [Music]
[1:57:04] for only in Christ are we secure
[1:57:07] amen
[1:57:10] and did you know all who are in Christ
[1:57:12] are predestinated
[1:57:14] amen
[1:57:15] and if you're predestinated then there's
[1:57:18] no one that can take your place
[1:57:20] you just have to forgive me but I'm
[1:57:23] thinking of Jacob and Esau the
[1:57:26] birthright belonged to Jacob or the Esau
[1:57:29] but Jacob was the one that got it do you
[1:57:32] realize
[1:57:33] that if you're predestinated and chosen
[1:57:35] in Christ there's no one that can take
[1:57:37] it
[1:57:40] no one can take your place at the
[1:57:42] marriage supper of the Lamb no one can
[1:57:44] fit your theophany body
[1:57:48] no one can take your place at the at the
[1:57:50] rapture
[1:57:52] no one can take your place at the time
[1:57:54] of the changing of our bodies
[1:57:56] if you were chosen in Christ you're
[1:57:58] bound to be there you cannot fail can
[1:58:03] you say man all do you love him
[1:58:06] and see how do we get in it by one
[1:58:09] Spirit the Holy Spirit are we baptized
[1:58:11] into one body
[1:58:12] into Christ and it's a supernatural
[1:58:15] birth
[1:58:17] Hallelujah brother Graham said
[1:58:18] Supernatural born by Supernatural Birth
[1:58:21] by a supernatural power
[1:58:24] he said in this day there is to come a
[1:58:26] super roll Seed of Abraham that's
[1:58:29] exactly what it'd be would be a rule

[1:58:35] be a natural seed it'll be a spiritual
[1:58:37] seed there is to be a spiritual bride
[1:58:40] raise up which will be this Royal seed

[1:58:47] days and the time and the place is a
[1:58:50] promise that's been given that's given
