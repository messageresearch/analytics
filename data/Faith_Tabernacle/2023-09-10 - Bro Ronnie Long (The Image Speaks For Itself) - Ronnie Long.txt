safely amen and thank you for the songs and special that was sung amen and as we're standing if we just open our scripture tonight I promise I'll try not to keep you as long as I did this morning but everybody made it to lunch on time right we survived well we see some different faces and that we'll just have to start over okay Genesis the first chapter we'll just start at the first verse here in the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth and in and the Earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep and the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters 26 verse was saying God said let us make man in our image after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over the cattle and over all the Earth and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the Earth so God created man in his own image in the image of God created he him male and female created he them and God saw everything that he had made and behold he said it was very good somebody say very good he saw everything that he had made and he said it was very good amen for just a few moments tonight want to speak on the the image will speak for itself amen father we love you Lord tonight we thank you for another opportunity to come and to hear from your your word tonight father and Lord we just ask that we'd be able to check our our thoughts Lord we'd be able to just check our burdens at the door father Lord and we just lay aside these few minutes Lord as we dedicate Our Lives to you one more time father Lord we ask that you would just Lord be in our midst tonight father Lord come once more in our in our midst father tonight Lord we don't just come out of tradition Lord and many have drove miles and put aside other things and obligations to be here tonight Lord and we don't want it just to be a an occasion where we came but Lord we want it to be a moment with you father Lord I pray that you take this word and make it a revelation unto us Lord make life to cause to come into it father and Lord it would come out of the pages of of this word and become such a such a tangible reality to us father that we could see you in your glory tonight father and Lord I give you all my strength father the Lord circumcise our lips and circumcise our ears father that we could hear from you alone father we give you ourselves in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen you may be seated tonight so we know this portion of scripture is very familiar to us that God created man in His image and there it's a hard thing to Fathom it's a hard thing to put your mind there that in the beginning was God and to go back that far in your mind to before there was any trial or circumstance or there was an earth to stand on there was Waters or there was there was something before all that and even before this this is where this is where Moses would be hearing from God I want you to start writing right here and Moses would be hearing from the mouth of God this is what I want you to transcribe this is how my book of generations is going to start I want you to start writing it right here and in the beginning was God because God is an object of worship right God is an object that is worshiped so before this there was an existence of Elohim right before there was a god there was uh there was a being there was a power that we would call Elohim and it is God right and then he put himself in an object of worship and in the beginning was God but before there was a beginning there was a beginning before this beginning there was a something there was a reality there was a there was there was an existence that never did have a beginning right it never where did this where did this object of worship come from but he had to have come from somewhere out of out of Eternity and placed himself in an object of worship that would have a name on it and it would have a reality to it and it would have something that you could you could relate to it but before that there was an existence right there was an eternal there so as we're as we're as we're looking at this thing God is creating creating something in his own image right something to pattern after himself and I heard Ed biscals say it like this one time that science tells us it took it takes 50 million or 300 million years to make the Earth to have enough salt and enough calcium and enough iron in it that life could exist and where your bodies could exist and there'd be food sources and and science tells us it took this long and that's fine because I don't care how long it took God it might have taken him millions or billions of years he's not in time he's he's creating in his own realm and his own eternity and Adam and Eve were in this this capsule out of time and there was time going on around them but yet they were caught out of that time in the garden right and things were happening and cosmosis were coming together and and things were moving into position and God God has this so perfectly orchestrated in his mind that there would be a place there would be a little a little blue dot in the middle of this black base and he would spend 300 million years to to design this place with enough salt and enough enough calcium in the dirt and and all the layers of the earth and to have all of the right elements that if we were just a few degrees off we'd burn up but we were a few degrees that way we'd be too cold and you know but just have something right in the middle just right in Perfection and I heard brother Ed say it like this if God spent hundreds of millions of years designing a place that we're going to spend 75 years on how much time did he spend on you how much time did he spend designing you that would be the image of his creation this is just a place that we're going to spend a few minutes on and he put all that time into that how much time did he spend on you the apple of his eye the image of his creation and God created man in his own image and he looked at the man and he said it's very good I like what I've made I like what I see it's very good I like this here I I like that I've made something that looks like me and you think about yourself and you think well I'm nothing like God but God looked at you and he said what I have made it is very good now to think about the artist's expression of this now I'm not an artist by by any means I can barely draw just a stick figure or something like that it's just not how my I can't get this to transfer to this and I can maybe see something but I can't get the shadowing there and it comes out looking you know what is this but there's how many artists are in the building how many draws or paints or okay so you have an artistic mind right now now being an artist is kind of a vulnerable thing right because you're exposing what's on the inside of you you are portraying a thought now that artist will take a canvas and she'll take some paint and some brushes and there'll be an empty canvas there let's just say this acoustic board was an empty canvas and you're sitting there with painting that now you know if you give me paint you're going to end up with some stick figures and some crew drawings but if you give her paint and a paintbrush she's going to create a thought that she already sees within her mind she already sees that there's going to be a flower pot there and the flower is going to be yellow and it's going to have this red outline and it's going to have to be on this Terrace and there's going to be the ocean view out behind the you see there's this whole view of a picture in her mind that she's going to create on this canvas it's the thought of the artist right so if we can look at maybe the Mona Lisa picture right I think it was Da Vinci that painted that and that was something that was in the mind of Da Vinci that he would put onto canvas right he saw a lady and she would look just like that and she would she would have just this characteristic and she would have this This Magnificent stare and he wouldn't settle or he wouldn't stop until it got to to that what he saw in his mind God didn't just throw some paint on the wall and say good enough but he wouldn't settle until he got to the Perfection of what was in his mind the thought that was in the back part of his mind he would have to work in labor until that would come into a reality that he could see it and he could behold it he could stand back and say there's my creation I imagine Da Vinci did all that work and he took a step back from the Mona Lisa and he said there's my work there's my creation and you know what he did when he got finished with it he signed it he put his signature on the bottom of it and he said I'll put my name next to this this is the this is the reality of my thought now God is the great artist and he's not just throwing paint on a campus he's not just throwing life out there but he is a he's the great artist portraying what is in his mind right we went over that this morning at the prophet of God pulled the thoughts out of the heart of God and brought him into view and now we see them in plain view once we beheld them Darkly as shadows and figures but now we can see them in plain sight I'm looking at the expressed attributes of God the thoughts of God that were in the back part of his mind but now they've been cast into the Earth in this age for this time for a purpose and God had designed this and he looked at it and he takes a step back and he said what I've created it's very good I like that it's very good now if God has put a stamp on you that you're very good I just take what God says about you I would just take this word and say despite what I think or despite what I look like in the mirror this morning God has already said I am very good he has created me in his own image and I'll settle for that I'm not gonna just I'm not just gonna take it at face value but I'm going to recognize there's an eternal work in here now it would be something for the Mona Lisa to look back at Da Vinci and be upset with how he painted her well I wish you would have made me like this or I wish you would have made me just this color hair or that or this color eyes or I wish that I would have had a smaller nose or I wish that and can you imagine this this this piece of art speaking back to the artist upset with how the artist has drawn you but it was created in the mind of the artist I wonder what Mona Lisa would say if she could speak but she was trapped in the mind of Da Vinci until he got paint brother will and he began to go to work and she began to get released if she could speak what would she say to him you might not think that you're a great piece of clay to work with but God's the great artist and he's got a vision of what he wants to see in the end he's got a vision of of what's in the it's it's already a thought in his mind and he's not just gonna stop if we're good enough but he's going to work and he's going to labor and he's going to chip away until he gets the Perfection that he's looking for Hallelujah he's not going to stop short but he's going to go all the way until he gets that Perfection and John 1 would say this in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and the 12 verse would say but as many as received him to them he gave he power to become the sons of God even to them that believe on his name which were born not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man but of God they were born of God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory and the glory as of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth the word became flesh and he caused his word to come into a flesh body and he looked at that creation he said it is very good but they were not born of blood or of water or of man or of dad or a mom but they were born of God so you really didn't come from your Earthly parents or your parents might have been named David or Bob or Jim and it really doesn't matter but you didn't really come from him you came from another father and you came from another genealogy where this genealogy it does not have a right over that one because that one was there first does that make sense right you were a child of God before you were ever a child of Chris long or you were ever a child of of Matt McLaren you were you were already a child of God before you ever were that child so that trumps this genealogy is that right you were already the expression of that God didn't just watch over your your your your recent heritage to watch over your grandma and your grandpa and your great grandpa think about all the connections that came together to make you who you are and we want to look back at the artist the the that painted us and say well I wish you didn't make me that way I wish I didn't have this this year I wish I didn't have this but he knows what he's doing and he's put everything in our life for a purpose and he's causing us to come to this point where the image can speak what what he put inside of it the image will speak for itself the image has a voice right now I sent the brother some pictures here I don't want to take too long so we'll we'll try to go through this but I sent him a picture here if they can get it up and in in in in in in in uh in uh in reality since I look at this and I think that that just looks like work I mean I'm in construction right so I know that this shows up on the job site I've got to get it somewhere I've got to move it and it just looks like work I need some piano dollies I need some I need a crane I need something I need to get this from A to B and it just looks like work to me but if you put this in the hands of the right person it's it's it's a masterpiece if you put this this block of granite in the hands of the right person it's a masterpiece but you put it in the hands of me or anybody else that doesn't have a vision for it and they'll destroy it they'll just they'll ruin it it'll just become a coffee table somewhere that's really heavy it'll never have a purpose but if you put that in the hands of somebody that can use it then they can release the potential that's already in it right so give me the next slide there brother this came from that this came from that same Stone now I did not did you see that when you saw that block there I didn't see that I just saw work but if you put that block in the hands of the right person this is what will come out of it because it's in the hand of the master they know how to get the value of what's already in there that was in that block the whole time Michelangelo made this Moses over years of his life and he said his famous quote was this was Moses was in the block I just needed to release him I just had to let him out a a free child of God is already in your clay you've just gotta get in the right hands of the master that knows how to activate it that can open it up and say I see the value within you it doesn't matter what I see or what he sees or what he sees but God sees the value within you that nobody else can see and he knows how to get the value out of his creation he knows the the elements that it takes and the situations that drove you here and the heartaches that you had to go through and the questions that you battled in your mind and the defeats that you've had to go how else would you be in this room tonight but God Almighty has created a way for you to express the value that's on the inside of you he knows what you look like on the inside because you're the thought of his expression he knows what he has thought of in his mind and he's not going to stop until it comes into full expectation of the way he saw it he's not going to just settle for good enough and you think God I can't go through another trial he's not going to settle for good enough he's got to have have a perfect work that he could take a step back and he could say what I've done is very good I see it and it's very good now to think about this that Michelangelo would take this block and he would go to work with a hammer and a chisel he began to work away on that because he would see something in there and Moses is sitting like this and he's holding the the Commandments and he's looking just this way and he would take the time and you imagine all of the effort that would go into that years and years and years and years and years and years brother Kevin years to master an art but he saw it he saw what it could be and he knew the potential that was laying within that block and he wasn't just going to stop for good enough he wasn't going to have it turned into a coffee table somewhere but he knew the value that was already within there and he just had to go to work on it now what if Moses the statue could speak what if he could talk do you think he would have said ow I mean he's getting whacked with a chisel and a hammer for 20 years if he could talk I imagine you say ow ouch ouch ouch now think about how big that block was and what's left all that came out of one block so what's left out of that block not much all that's left is the perfect vision of what the artist saw he's not there's no fluff left in there there's no world left in there there's there's no Humanity left in there but all that's left is what the artist saw in his mind and that's what he's going to strive for that's what he's going for because he knows what you can hold he knows the value that's on the inside of you and you might not ever receive that value from anybody else your Daddy might have never said he loved you or he might have ever cared for you but there's a value within there that God Alone can see and he is going to refine you and refine you and refine you until that value comes out and it's in plain view that value will show itself God will not settle until his word comes full such attention to detail that's not just thrown you into this age of laodicea just hoping that you make it out but he's Pace if he can pay so much attention to detail that he could have an entire ecosystem for a place that you're going to spend a few years how much did he spend on you you're not just here by chance so if Michelangelo a man that we don't even know if he had a real relationship with the Lord but somehow he had a god-given gift as an artist to portray a masterpiece to put a masterpiece on display would take the time to take that much attention to detail that he's showing us something here that God is a god of detail God is a God that knows every end from the out he knows every thought that's in your mind he knows every direction you would have gone he knows every mistake you would have made he knows everything you've been through but yet even through all those mistakes he looks at his creation and he says it's very good he says I like what I've done it's very very good give me that next slide brother you see this picture here maybe some of you know this and have seen this but I thought this was pretty special so the arrow there is pointing at this tendon in in the in the statue's arm and this tendon is flexed because the pinky uh finger is moved in like that and when you do that your your tendon moves in your arm that tendon flexes when you move that finger so the artist's attention to detail was so great that when when he said it's got to look just that way and if you can see this without a blurry picture there maybe you could see in real life sometime and see the intricate work of the veins and and almost the real-like texture of the skin now he did this out of that block that I showed you the same block but had such attention to detail that he knew that when this pinky moves this tendon moves and it's got to be so lifelike it's got to be so real I'm not just gonna settle for an arm I've got to have a super detailed arm now look at the muscle shape in that arm now this was just a man with a chisel and think about if a man with a chisel can do that how much could God Almighty with every resource imaginable available could go to work on you to make sure that you come out the perfect work that he saw in his mind this is the expression of an artist right you're seeing Michelangelo's thought on display here and I am seeing God's thought on display here he's not just throwing you into this world with no hell but he's designed everything perfectly that you can come out with the maximum value which is within you and there's nothing higher than to be a child of God who has more Authority in heaven child of God there's no higher Authority in the land and to be the design thought of God cast into this age and thoughts begin to come out of that Elohim mind and thoughts begin to come into creation and and he would say I need thoughts for this for this age and I need thoughts for the martyrs age where they would be able to have an anointing so strong that they would be able to watch their children killed in front of them and they would walk into a lion's den and they would burn it at a stake and they would do all but but they would profess Christianity in the Lord Jesus Christ as their savior above all I need some thoughts there and he began to think of these individuals that would come out and they would spawn out of the the mind of Elohim before the beginning I have a I have a thought of a man who would come up in the systems of religion he will learn nine languages he will be such a such a walking Pharisee but yet I'll strike him off his horse and he'll come down into humility and he'll come the way of the beggar you know come the way of the of the mud dauber and he'll come under the religion that nobody thought was worth anything and he thought of Paul in his mind the thought of Paul began to come out from the ages great he had a thought for every age and he's had a thought for this age I need some people who will come into the darkest age that there's ever been in the darkest hour when it seems like there's no hope and there's no living God and everybody's forsaking him and everybody's walked away but there will be a people that will be in that time that will be the Fulfillment of what I've seen in my mind and we begin to come out of the mind of Elohim back in the eternities back in the mind of God that's why we don't feel like we had any beginning or we don't have any and we're not supposed to fit in here we're not supposed to fit in with the Walmarts we were made before before there ever was we've just got to come to a place of remembrance to remember who we really are it takes some trials to remember who you are it takes some struggles to remember who you really are we could turn to the Book of Job and read it all the way through and we see that it by that job remembered all right amen right it wasn't just for no purpose job was already a godly man have you considered my servant job have you considered job and he was Godly enough that God would Point him out by name and say look at job's life you can't touch it because there's a seed in there there's a gene seed in there and I know the value that's within job and he caused the devil to go to work on job and take the hammer in the Chisel and begin to carve away job and begin to Define job's life out but they he God knew the value that was in job and he said go to work on job do anything but take his life and he took he took children he took lands he took riches he took his health he took everything that he could touch except for his life but it was all to bring Perfection to job and what did it cause job to do where were you job where were you before the beginning before in the beginning was God where were you before that and job had an Amnesia check and he come back to reality that was within him and said I remember where I was I remember who I was I remember that I wasn't always this way I remember that I'd always walk and defeat and walk and woe with me I remember I was in Victory and I'm going back there hey job had a had a memory check and it was by the hand of the master that put him under the fire that took off everything but the image he's not going to stop short of the perfect image and when it came time for job to speak back to the artist he said I was there I was there when the morning star sang in the sons of God shouted for Glory I was there he had a he had a memory come back into him all things in remembrance to realize that we didn't just come here we're not just spending 70 or 80 or 90 years here but we came here to be the expressed image of God he saw the value in you when you didn't feel like there was any value in you he saw the reality in you when you you didn't feel like you didn't feel like it was you he says watch carefully now before there ever was a speck of Stardust before God was God and he was known only as an eternal spirit the bride was already somebody say already in his mind yes she was she was existing in his thoughts and what about those thoughts of God they're Eternal are they not that's what he's asking his church and then he asks them again the Eternal thoughts of God let me ask you are the thoughts of God Eternal remember I quoted this this morning if you can see this you will see many things God is unchangeable in both Essence and behavior we have studied that and proven that already God is infinite in his ability so therefore he as God must be omniscient he if he is omniscient he is not now learning nor is he taking counsel even within himself nor is it anytime adding knowledge if he can add knowledge then he's not omniscient he has never had a new thought about anything that's preaching material buddy he's never had a new thought you're not a new thought God you've always been a part of God you've always been an offspring of God you've always been in the mind of God you've always been in the heart of God even when you didn't realize it you were there he has always had and always will have and knows the end from the beginning because he is God thus the thoughts of God are Eternal and they are real not they are not simply like a man with a blueprint he has drawn up in which one day you'll be translated into substance form but they are already real already real you're unborn children already real there are already real thoughts before you ever stepped afoot on this Earth you were already real in the mind of God you already came from behind that David would pick this up and say for thou Hast possessed my Reigns thou has covered me in my mother's womb I will praise thee for I am fearfully and wonderfully made marvelous are thy works and that thy Soul knoweth right well my substance was not hid from thee when I was made in secret and curiously wrought in the lowest parts of the year if that eyes did see my substance yet being unperfect and in that book where all my members were written which in continuance were fashioned when as yet there was none of them how precious also are they thoughts unto me oh God how great is the sum of them if I should count them they are more in number than the sand when I awake I'm still with thee the Amplified would break this down and say in the depths of the earth your eyes have seen my unformed substance he already saw you before you ever came into this being you already were and if you can establish this brother Brown said if you can see this if you can see that you didn't just come into this body here for this moment in time but if you can see that you always were then you can see that you always will be if you can see that Revelation to know that I didn't just come in here but I've always been here we're just in the development stage of this how many knows what a dark room is right okay I don't I'm not an expert here but I think this is how it works Daniel so somebody takes this picture now we live in the age of instinct right where they can take a picture on the phone they can look at no I don't like that one take another one no I don't know but back in the day when they when they would first take the pictures you didn't know if you were smiling blinking you didn't know if you were staring at a bird you didn't know anything until that picture was developed it took time to develop the picture and the only one who knew what the picture looked like was the one who took it and they used to get underneath this big thing you know umbrella thing and they get in there and they boom and the light bulb would flash and it would take a picture and everybody would be stunned exactly Frozen in Time where they were and that image would strike the magnetic film and it would cast that light there right I believe that's how it works and then they would take that magnetic film into a dark room right they couldn't expose it to any light because all that light would just saturate the image that was already on there right and they would have to take it in there and they would have to bring it into a dark room now the way a dark room works is you can't have one of these lights in there but you can only have a red light and that red light will not over saturate the picture but it will bring it to its development so you can see what you're doing in there and the way I understand it is there's three different tubs of chemicals that the way this dark room works right and you put it in the first one and it brings it to resolution right and you put it in the second one and it it really brings the clarity what's on the on the image there and the third one seals the image there so then after that seal is dry you can turn on the light is that right I think that's how it works right it's close I know it's I know it's three elements I'm pretty sure that's how they work right so you take the first one and you put it into and you put it into justification and you and you work on it until it begins to express the image of what's on that paper and it begins to come out and take away all this and all that and it begins to take away all the outside and it begins to let that image come into fold you there and the only way that that artist can check what's on the picture is to hold it up to the red light and let the blood show it what's going on in the development process and it holds it up to the blood and it says yeah I like the way that's coming out but I need to wash it a little more sometimes just gotta get washed a little more because we're not going to settle for good enough but brother Branham told us that God took a perfect picture of you before the foundation of the world now I used to worry about this and think well when I'm 19 I've got to have abs and I've got to be in shape because that's going to be my Eternal Body but God didn't take a picture of you at 19 here on Earth because at 19 I already had scars on my hands I already had I was already balding I was already you know it didn't take a picture of you here at that age she took a picture of you in perfection in the back part of his mind and that's what he's carving away to achieve he sees the image he knows what it's supposed to look like he knows the value of it and he's not making you go through these trials in vain but he is not stopping until Perfection strikes Glory thank you that's why Peter said we're thankful for the trials we're thankful for this because it's through this he worketh Perfection he's working perfection in your life and he's dunking you in the tank and you think I don't want to go back yeah he's not gonna stop short of perfection and he holds that image up to the blood and says yeah it's coming along nicely and the Holy Ghost reports back and says yeah they're coming along nicely I think it'll come out to the perfect image that you saw in them ah maybe maybe not everybody saw it and the preacher didn't see it in the and the Evangelist didn't seen your mom didn't see it and your daddy didn't see it but God saw something within you [Music] he saw a value within you that that didn't just show up one day but he put it there because you were a thought of his before there ever was an earth to stand on before there ever was a a trial before there ever was a circumstance a sickness a cold a birth you were there if you can see this you'll see many things that's right I was there we've just got to remember where we came from and we're all in different stages of this development some in this first tank some in the second tank but they don't put you in the third tank until you're ready to be sealed you don't get put in that last tank until you're done in the first two and then when he puts you in the sealer that's the finished work that's the finished product and as that sealer begins to dry on there and he holds it up yeah everything's checking out nice all the imperfections are gone I've got all the all the fading out of there I've got all the shadowing out of there I've got everything at the resolution is perfect on this and he puts it in the sealer to sign off on it the last thing that the artist does is sign it it's wearing my name it's got my brand it's wearing my signature my reputation is in that picture an artist doesn't just sign any work but he's only signing that which he's proud of and he's come down in this age and he is signed off on this church to say this is the finishing Church these are the ones that will take what I've said and they will take it all the way and they will overcome by the blood of the lamb and the word of their testimony hey somebody say they they will overcome we've already overcome the mind of God we already are victorious in the mind of God we're just going through the development stage of this and we have a voice to this right the whole thing about Michelangelo made him famous is after he spent all that time on that he was so he thought there would be he thought there would be a life in there he spent so much of his lifetime creating that image he said this thing should be alive this should be Moses he should speak and he said speak speak and he got so welled up with him he struck it with his hammer speak if the image could speak what would Moses have said oh my I was once with no value I was once stuck in a block I was once just a granted piece in the middle of nowhere nothing to me no name no value I was just an Abram Idol worshiping somewhere I was just another somebody out there somewhere but when the master went to work on me when the master touched me everything became different my mentality became different my thinking became different my goals became different my vision became different everything about me changed why because I was touched by the master who knew the value that was Within Me he took something unlovable and loved it he took something ugly and made it beautiful he took something broken and restored it if you could see me where I was and see how the master came down to me he sees the value within you church he knows what's on the inside he knows what you're capable of anybody in here in management and work have you ever been any kind of boss or management position sometimes an individual comes to work for you and you know there's some something more than what they're giving you know that there's something more inside that person than what they're doing it frustrates you because you know it and they're just being lazy or they're not aware of how talented they are and so as they're as their manager or boss you try to force them then why are you being mean to me because potential I see the value on the inside if you would just get dedicated to this and if you would just give it your all you could be the greatest master of this craft because you see the value in there brother Kevin and be like somebody coming to you and how can you teach them how to play the guitar and instantly they're just shredding the chords you think man the potential in there but then they come and they haven't practiced once since the last time they came and visited you and it frustrates you you're like why aren't you practicing you've got the talent you've got the gift you've just got to work it so I as a preacher feel coming into the house of God and seeing potential potential potential potential potential potential potential and all we've got to do is apply all that we are and come into this fully and we will be underneath the hands of the master and he will take us from what we were into what he wants us to be the Perfection of that picture our whole goal in this is to get back to that picture of what he took of us before there ever was a sin or a scar or a wrinkle or an upset there's a picture of you but what's happened is you imagine if somebody broke into the to the Louvre or wherever they've got the Mona Lisa and spray painted over it [Music] and you walk in there and you've taken your life savings to go on vacation to Perry and you walk in there and there's there's the the art piece you wanted to see and it's got spray paint all over it well who would do that somebody that was trying to devalue what was there exactly you know the funny thing about spray paint is it washes off if you spray paint over an oil picture it'll just wipe right off but that oil base that perfect picture was was there before there was any graffiti written over this there was an original picture before graffiti was sprayed all over this there was an original message before men got a hold of it and began to spray paint their own Doctrine and their own ideas and their own Theology and they begin to take this rattle can and go to work on the message but underneath that there's an original message that is Untouched by man that has just been covered with some temporary writing and I think it's time we take the blood and we begin to wash off what somebody has painted over our life to say we're this or we're that or we're never going to be this or we're never going to be that I say it's time you duck the hot sip in the blood and begin to wash your picture clean and say I want to be restored back to where I was before there ever was an upset in this life I'm going back Beyond this not back to the beginning of my life here Way Beyond that back into the eternities I had a voice where were you when the sons of God shouted so we had a voice and her under her messenger will be the final voice to the final age he has struck the image speak speak why are you crying under me speak why are you lamenting under me speak he struck the image of your life and he's saying go on don't settle for what you've been given Church move Beyond this move Beyond this just this temporary world that we're in and see the way God sees you he says but remember the bride will be a called out separated different filled with the Holy Ghost born washed in the blood of the Lamb shall abstain from everything that's filthy around her she is the chase virgin pure by the word the word and her are the same somebody say same as a man as a man and his wife becomes one in Union so does the real genuine Church of God when he becomes in Christ the Bible is punctuated with an amen every promise don't make any difference what the denomination says the soul that's in The Believer will punctuate it because it is the word in him speaking out it's the word in you he sent his word into this age that is what's in you giving you the power to become sons of God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among them and that power gave them the ability to become the sons of God it's the it's the word living in you talk about untapped resources that's right well I don't feel like it I'm tired and I'm tired well I'm tired I preached this morning [Music] but it's not about how I feel it's not about how I I feel like well you should be preaching me happy and I'm just going to sit here and tell you excite me praise the Lord God's not an Entertainer God didn't come into this house tonight to entertain us to to to say I'm going to excite you with emotion God came into this house tonight to show us the value of what's on the inside of us that is greater than any temporary high it's greater than any temporary blessing the value that's on the inside of you cannot be reproduced it cannot be replaced it cannot be taken away but the value within you came from before I think we've got the point now right so we came from before so how long have you been a Christian where did you come from what's in you that's greater brother Branham says it's Christ the Anointed God that was in Christ is in you greater is he that's in you than he that's in the world then if he is in you it's not you anymore living it's him living in your thinking what you would think about this is what he said about this that if he is in you he absolutely would not deny what he said he couldn't do it but he would keep that what he has said and he is trying to find I I think this is powerful brother Terry God is trying to find he's seeking trying to find that person that he can vindicate himself through I say it's me friend I don't know about you but I say if God is looking for somebody to vindicate his word through here I am yeah I'm a man of unclean lips I don't deserve it I'm not worthy of it but Here I Am Lord vindicate yourself through me I'll give everything that I am to let your word be Vindicated in my life it doesn't matter what these 75 years hold here just be the Vindicated word of the hour it wasn't just for the prophet to be the Vindicated word there's a bride on the earth that will be the Vindicated word of the hour they will fulfill every line every promise every amen every Victory they are the value of the word the artist has seen what's on the inside of you and he's refining it get in the hands of the Potter he knows what your potential is he knows what you're capable of I think about that story where the man would tell about that violin there at the auction right you all know it and they would say they couldn't give the thing away what do I have for this whole violin a dollar two bits five cents what do you anybody anybody never just getting ready give that thing away shamaya oh my if we could see us the way that God sees us Brother Sam we're probably not worth anything to anybody on this Earth they'd probably gladly give us up because they don't know the potential that's within there they don't know the reality of the value that's on the inside of the heart of a of a son or daughter of God and they'll just throw it away they'll just let that relationship go they'll just go ahead and say what you weren't worth anything anyway just be be gone see you bye later right you've been there how many relationships you've gone through in your life where they never recognize the value they never realized they were entertaining a son or daughter of God in their presence and you were thrown out of houses you were through I've been thrown out of the same church twice in my life true story I can't help it that they don't see the value on here that's the story for another time it's too long I can't help it that they don't see this but I know that I've been in the hands of the master and whatever his potential is for me I want to live to that potential and this violin sat there Dusty and old and tarnished and you might have never been you might have never been used by the Lord in your life and you sat there wondering if there was anything in you that was of value and you thought what's the point of continuing on you thought what am I even doing here but if you could just get in the hands of the master for a few moments and that old man came from the back of the of the building and he took the violin in his hand he said give that thing to me let me play it and he began to say there is a fountain and he began to play the sweetest medley filled with blood drawn from Emmanuel's veins where Sinners plunge beneath the flood the same violin it didn't change it was the same violin but in the hands of the master it became innumerable in value and they didn't know what to give for and everybody in the room was crying and the auctioneer was crying and the man sets down the bow and he walks away and they say well I have five thousand ten thousand fifteen thousand and they begin to see the value increased when it got in the hands of the master so if you feel like you're not great in value or you don't have anything to give to this cause just get into the presence of the master and watch him go to work in your life you might not have much but what you do have put it in his hands and watch him multiply it what do we have to eat we better send these people away we can't feed them Jesus said what do you have well we've got a couple pieces of bread and a couple of fish brother will we might just have a little bit of Faith but put it in his hands and watch him go to work on it put what you do have in his hand and watch it multiply and multiply and multiply watch the value come out in that because he knows how to get the value out of his creation he looked at it and he said it's very good praise God I like what I see I like what I've created Hallelujah to finish this quote brother man would say he's trying to find someone he can vindicate himself through and that doesn't mean he has to do it to everybody in the time that Moses let the children of Israel there was one that was Moses the rest of them just followed the message some of them tried to raise up an impersonating God said separate yourself and just swallow them up see now but that's that he that's in you then he that's in the world is greater but God in you like he was in Jesus Christ because what all God was he poured into Christ somebody say all with me just we're on the same page all that God was he poured into Christ and all Christ was he poured into the church see that's God in you he that's in you no wonder winds and waves obey him obeyed his words obeyed obeyed him because it's God's word through him he was a man but he was the word made flesh and when he spoke it was God speaking through human lips no wonder the wind and waves the very creator that created the winds and the ways was in him now think of it think deep now he says for I come to this moment of closing no wonder demons paralyzed at his word it was God in him it was God in Christ the demons was paralyzed no wonder the dead that was that was turning back to the dust could not lay there at his word for he was the word [Music] get it it's the word in flesh we're not detailed in the way that that statue of Moses was detailed but yet even in that example the body moves on its own it moves for itself that you didn't have to you move your pinky she might move your pinky like this you didn't have to tell your tendon down there to move it moved on its own why because it's part of the body I take this step and my toes automatically go out why because it's balanced they're part of the body we don't have to tell you how to operate under the unction of the Holy Ghost you're part of the body we do what we do Under the inspiration of the spirit for We Are The Bride Church in this age and for somebody to come in here and tell me that I'm not I can't do that I can't have a prayer line I can't lay my hands on somebody I can't shout I can't dance I can't I can do whatever I feel to do you know why because I'm free and as long as it's in the order of the church I'm free to operate under the unction of the holy spirit for who is writing the last book of Acts [Applause] I can't speak for anybody else but I am writing a chapter in the last book of Acts so I would be the one to know how the bride of Christ acts she acts like I do she acts like you do she acts like you do she responds like you do she gets she gets a little emotional like I do why because we are the bride and we are the ones right in the last book we are the final voice to the final age and I don't care how many critics come into the house of God and say that you shouldn't do this and you shouldn't do that and you shouldn't act like this well you should go back and read your Bible [Applause] because every man operated under the unction of the Holy Ghost in that day and they did the ax of those that were filled with the spirit of God that's what we're doing in this age friends we're not bound we're not chained we're not defeated the chain that you think's holding you is an imaginary chain it's not real there's nothing real to it he's a bluff he's a liar he's a fake I don't know how to put it he's he's defeated he doesn't have the keys to his own house in it and to think that we would sit there in a in a jail cell when the door is wide open on Emancipation Proclamation day there was a slave who got the news before everybody else and he came to the other slaves he said we're free yeah I said hey you better be quiet man you know what to hear you oh you better not say that Devil's got a Punch coming buddy he's got a Punch coming but I've already made it on the other side Monday morning's coming but I've already made it on the other side he's got a blow coming to you but I've already defeated him I already know who wins I already know I'm the Victor in this I already know that he's defeated and I win so I'm not scared to attack him toe-to-toe I'm not scared to go right to his door because he doesn't even have the keys to it kick in the door and said I'm taking back what you have taken from me I think it's a time in this age where we've got to take back what the devil stole from us was there ever a time in your life where you had joy unspeakable and full of Glory why not now I think it's time to take it back go back to the devil's house kicking his door and say I want it back it's yours to have it's got your name on it it's your possession do you remember a time when you weren't always tired and fatigued and sick and Afraid come on take it back how about the night we first got the Holy Ghost you remember what it was like brother Amos I didn't care what anybody thought about me I didn't care who was looking what was happening I didn't care what song was being sung I didn't care the trouble in the offices in the church I didn't care that this was on tune or not on tune I didn't care about anything all I know is that something happened in me and when you first walk out of that cell and you're free for the first time in your life whoo [Applause] hallelujah oh my and everybody's your buddy everybody's your friend now you can shake hands you're hugging everybody's your pal everybody's your your homie everybody's just good to go what happened take it back take back the unity and fellowship take back a smile on your face take back being able to enjoy your salvation go back and take it say I'm not you've had it too long devil you've had my victory too long you've had my dance too long you've had my shout too long I'm going to your camp and I'm taking back what rightfully belongs to me it's my voice in the end and I'm going to take it back the authority of the position of the believer in this age there is nothing that we cannot claim in this word every promise is in fulfillment right now every promise the spoken word authority to be healed under while Peter yet spec these words I'm just gonna deal with this for a second okay Peter was not teaching some dry intellectual sermon go back and read acts 10 Peter was preaching the power of the Holy Ghost and while Peter preached these words the Holy Ghost fell upon them so you're not going to get away with just saying having a dry lecture and expecting the Holy Ghost to come in will you preach the word under an anointing where lies could be changed under the preaching of the word and I'll get behind you but don't try to use it as a crutch to say well we can just speak and it'll work no you've got to preach an anointing like Peter preached where the Holy Ghost can move in Liberty and change hearts and change lives and if it happens that way I'm under that Covenant if it happens through a prayer line and the laying of it on of hands I'm also under that Covenant I don't care how it happens just let it happen well you're going to get too fanatical they're going to call me a fanatic anyway I'm too far gone into this but the BAM said it like this they call me a Holy Roller he said well I guess if the Lord asked me to roll I would that's about how I feel right now if the Lord told me to roll I'd roll if the Lord told me to to run to the back and the friend I do it whatever the Lord tells me to do because he's seeking worshipers that will worship Him in spirit and in truth that will do only what he says do oh my God Jesus thank you Jesus we're not we're not guessing at this but we have word for this you have to try so hard to cut out the moving of God in the word to line up with a Doctrine you've got to really try because it's just everywhere in there and the spirit of God in the beginning the spirit of God what oh he moved well we're not for the moving of The Spirit Well God was let me say this the angel of the Lord is pleased with the moving of the spirit because one time there in Indiana brother random was preaching and a little dunker girl got so caught up under the anointing because a crippled baby began to run across the aisle there that she knew I think it was her niece or nephew or something and she was there playing the piano and the age of the Lord was so pleased by the moving of the spirit that when she got up to praise the Lord the angel continued playing the piano don't tell me that God's not in the moving of the spirit don't tell me that God's not an emotion he absolutely is an emotion he absolutely isn't is in is in is in Praise In Worship and the dance he's in all that amen but let me say what's happened is somebody has come and put a label over that you feel guilty for doing it oh my well I don't know about is this okay are we okay but Sean you come correct me if you need to but this is the way I see it somebody's put a label over the church and now we're afraid to enter into a greater a greater realm of worship because of what somebody might say about us or what we might think about us now I know how this works friends because I've been here and you do a victory dance at camp and then the next week you're feeling solo oh my maybe it was just emotion maybe nothing really happened that day and then the devil is with his label maker before you know it he's put label over label over label remember we were talking about earlier about the books how it only had we only had books and tapes and nobody had the table and the Terry you remember the red volume sets my dad had a red volume said and man he wore them things out right he had the front and back he had red duct tape on him and he had highlights and riding in there and every well one day his steelbook went missing he was devastated oh my and he had some printed out quotes and but those days not everybody had a computer and you had to go find somebody that had a computer search out the quote to print it out and you know and then he would just you know borrow some of these red book here and you know get this quote and then write it down and go on you know but he didn't have one well one day we find ourselves visiting with this brother and he's got a whole set on this shelf and my dad said oh yeah yeah and grabs up and grabs the seal book he said I was looking for this quote do you mind him no no go ahead flipping through it yeah there it is man that looks like my handwriting man I made that same note there that's incredible and it began I was just a little little it got weird it got really weird in the room and he flipped over to another and he flipped to the back of the book no no no sure enough it said the guy's name you know Reverend so and so he flips back and I was gonna look for this quote I made the same no I drew the drew the same little of the Statue of a perfect man next to that quote that you drew and it looks just like my handwriting weird they began to get really weird in there and he flips to the back of the book but he notices there's a little curl on the edge of that label he thought no surely not brother will he just rips off that label and his name is underneath that label and he said this is my volume this is my shield book oh I don't know how that happened I'm not sure how that label got over there well I think it's time that we the Church of the Living God recognize that we are the Church of the Living God and take the label off of whatever some enemy some some dried up old traditional preacher put over the church to say we can't we can't we can't I say I can I say I will I say I do believe rip the label off the church and let God be God in the building let God do as he willeth in your life let God activate something within you that you can release an atmosphere of worship and of joy and a praise that you've never known before rip the label off of that you'll not find anywhere in this word where it's not allowed for you to praise the Lord don't Worship the Lord you will not find it you will not find a scripture but to the contrary you will find David said let everything that half breath praise ye the lord it's our commission if the image were to speak it would say thank you it would say ah you Release Me From The Bondage that I was in it would have an expression of thanks to give I who was once trapped in sin am now free to worship been called and exalted on high a son and daughter of God I'll never have an end I'll never cease to exist for I am Eternal and the thoughts of God never will have an end I've got reason to praise him I've got reason to shout I've got reason to have joy unspeakable and full of Glory because I know where I come from Hallelujah I know why I'm here I know why I've been sent here in this age to become the Fulfillment of the prophecy of God himself the image and he looked at it and he said it's very good brother Branham says when you worship uninhibited I have the quote for you it pleases him wow oh my God it pleases the father when we worship without reserve it pleases the father when we're able to rip off every label every band every bondage Every Chain every shackle and we recognize that he's supreme authority in the land he can do anything all things are possible through him it doesn't matter how great the chain or the years that have gone by it doesn't matter the damage that's been done but all things are possible Glory why wouldn't we let our voice ring out who if our piano player could come why wouldn't we why would we use it to backbite somebody why we use our voice to talk negative about somebody or negative about ourselves or to say well I wish I could or maybe it's for me or maybe it's not for me why would we use our voice for so many other things than what our voice was intended to be used for it's an honest question why because we don't recognize the potential that's in true worship the band would say it's What God Says the bride is the word they're one when that word that's wrote in there becomes in you and make you the word becomes one that's exactly what he promised then interpret it God don't need an interpreter they say well we interpret it like this you've got no right to interpret nothing God does his own interpretation God said let there be light and there was light who interprets that you don't need an interpretation he said a virgin shall conceive and she did that don't need any interpreter it's already interpreted God said these things would happen in this day and it is it don't need no interpreter it interprets itself amen and God made man in his own image [Music] [Applause] interprets itself we're the people of a prophecy are we not [Music] we're not doing manufacturing it we're just walking in perfect step with the word no nothing you couldn't work up to a true worship if you wanted to a false label that the devil's put over the church without a bunch of work up and emotion sure there's Pentecostal churches that are working up but you could not come under true worship if you worked up with all your might and all that within you but it only comes by revelation true worship only comes by the revelation of what he is to you who you are in him the thankfulness that's within your heart to cry out and how dare some preacher try to say that you can't release a praise in the house of God I defy that spirit that would try to bind the children of God from worshiping him as he deserves to be worshiped that's our purpose here on this Earth to worship him and he's seeking somebody his own words the father seeketh looking searching is there anybody is there anybody that'll worship me in spirit and in truth is there anybody that'll take the reality of the word that I brought and see the truth of the matter and then give back Worship in the spirit is there anybody that will move within both Realms at the same time in the middle of the road to be perfectly balanced in spirit and in truth is there anybody in this age that recognizes why we're here why we've been given this word why we've been given this Revelation it does no good to be taught everything from Genesis to Revelation if you don't apply it to your life though I know all the Mysteries though I know I can speak with tongue of men and angels but I don't have the love for God's word which is shown by the way we worship [Music] hallelujah hallelujah keep it so he cleaned me up inside he thought I was too tired [Music] thank you [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] all right [Music] everybody [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] I worship you I'll give you glory forever because I am free because I am whole and I will tell everyone I know oh holy [Music] Hallelujah Glory to the God who changed my life and we'll praise you I'll worship you I'll give you glory forever because I am free because I am home and everyone I know Hallelujah you know that's just the way God operates [Music] how many remembers the story of how brother Branham got the baptism of the Holy Ghost we talk about how he came to the Lord behind the Coal Shed right but you know how he got the baptism the Holy Ghost he was on a date with a girl and he was walking in downtown and all of a sudden he realized he was walking in the middle of a vision that he'd been there before and he was walking by this old converted Saloon in the basement of this downtown building with a bunch of negroes worshiping the Lord and getting carried away in charismatics what we would call Azusa Street Pentecost and he was walking by that building and the Lord spoke to him and said you you need what they have now you go back and read this I got seven or eight quotes on this without money or without price you can go read it in your time and he says in the in the most unlikely place in the most illegitimate people the worst people the most illegitimate place you'd ever think of on the earth God came down and we don't know the brother's name we don't know what he preached we don't know what he was saying but he preached an atmosphere of an anointing so great when brother Branham had to turn into the building that little lady he was with said if you go in there Bill Branham you'll never have it never date with me again and he said bye foreign you might have to give up a few relationships you might have to give up a few things you might have to say bye to a few a few things holding you down but the prophet of God led by example and he said bye Felicia I got a mission in here I've got somewhere to be in here they have what I need and without money or without pricing brother Brandon said this they're on the floor I received the Holy Ghost if it was good enough for the prophet it's good enough for me you see a man won't read that quote when he's trying to keep you in a dry atmosphere but read the entire message and find out what the reality of the matter is they're on the floor the prophet of God received the Holy Ghost and he said they had what I needed [Music] it's good enough for him it's good enough for me I think we ought to praise him unreserved Mr maybe let's try a d chord [Music] to be in the presence of the Lord foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] families restored words because we stay Ed here in your presence [Music] no one had to say a word couldn't
