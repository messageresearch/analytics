[44:14] that you would comfort them help them
[44:16] Father during this time of loss Lord of
[44:20] grief we ask it Lord in Jesus Christ's
[44:24] name amen and amen
[44:27] amen Matthew the third chapter and
[44:33] um we're going to start at the 13th
[44:40] verse but it says then Jesus then cometh
[44:44] Jesus From Galilee to Jordan unto John
[44:48] to be baptized of him but John forbade
[44:52] him saying I have need to be baptized of
[44:54] thee and comest thou to to me and Jesus
[44:58] answering said unto him suffer it be to
[45:00] be so now for thus it becometh us to
[45:05] fulfill all
[45:06] righteousness than he suffered him amen
[45:11] then if you'll turn to the Book of John
[45:13] the 13th
[45:21] chapter John the 13th chapter
[45:26] and
[45:28] uh we'll read the third and fourth
[45:31] verses
[45:34] there but the third the third verse um
[45:39] is really what I want to get to um but
[45:44] Jesus knowing everybody say Jesus
[45:47] knowing that the father had given all
[45:49] things into his hands and that he was
[45:52] come from God and went to God he riseth
[45:54] from supper and laid aside his garments
[45:57] and took a towel and girded
[46:01] himself amen you can have your seats
[46:04] this evening and uh we we do want to
[46:07] remember communion this coming
[46:10] Sunday as well in the evening but
[46:14] um I if I have a title I I'm going to
[46:18] title it um understanding who we are and
[46:23] um we read where Jesus comes to John and
[46:29] um he didn't just happen to stumble onto
[46:33] John or just kind of wander that
[46:35] direction or whatever but he
[46:37] intentionally went to him and uh for
[46:42] Jesus recognized that John was a true
[46:46] Prophet on the earth and that the word
[46:50] had spoken of John and and of course the
[46:54] word comes to the prophets and so he
[46:57] knew that John was the prophet of the
[47:00] hour and John knew that Jesus was the
[47:03] Messiah of the hour and so the they had
[47:08] uh they both had a clear understanding
[47:12] of who each other was
[47:15] simply out of the word of God then you
[47:19] know the the scripture that we use often
[47:22] but Luke
[47:24] 17:28 Jesus says likewise also as it was
[47:29] in the days of lot they did eat they
[47:31] drank they bought they solded they
[47:33] planted they build it but the same day
[47:35] that lot went out of Sodom it rained
[47:37] fire and brimstone from heaven and
[47:39] destroyed them all even thus shall it be
[47:42] in the day when the son of man is
[47:45] revealed and we we believe and know that
[47:48] this is a scripture that is prophetic of
[47:50] our day and and so
[47:54] therefore it it as it did for John and
[47:58] Jesus it requires us to have a clear
[48:02] understanding uh you see as as the the
[48:07] the prophet said that the scriptures are
[48:09] written so that the wise of the world
[48:11] will not understand and Jesus here in in
[48:16] Matthew 11:25 says I thank thee oh
[48:20] Father Lord of Heaven and Earth because
[48:22] thou H has hid these things from the
[48:24] wise and prudent and has revealed them
[48:26] unto babes another scripture Paul there
[48:30] in in 1 Corinthians 2:9 it says but it
[48:34] as it is written I hath Not Seen Nor Ear
[48:37] heard neither have entered into the
[48:39] heart of man the things which God hath
[48:41] prepared for them that love him but God
[48:45] hath revealed them unto us by spirit for
[48:48] the spirit searcheth all things ye the
[48:50] Deep things of God for what man knoweth
[48:52] the things of a man save the spirit of
[48:54] man which is in him even so the things
[48:56] of God knoweth no man but the spirit of
[48:59] God now we have received not the spirit
[49:01] of the world but the spirit which is of
[49:03] god that we might know the things that
[49:05] are freely given to us of God so that
[49:10] that we uh that Paul is speaking of is a
[49:13] different class because brother brandham
[49:16] says that the world uh the worldly
[49:18] minded people will not understand but it
[49:21] is the spiritual minded people that
[49:24] understands amen and understanding is
[49:26] important because Daniel
[49:29] 12:10 it says that none of the wicked
[49:32] shall understand but the wise everybody
[49:36] say the wise the wise shall understand
[49:40] and and so the understanding that we
[49:42] were talking about is a spiritual
[49:45] understanding which the Bible speaks of
[49:48] and and and I want to just to put this
[49:51] uh here maybe for you young people and
[49:54] that is that it's it it it's being wise
[50:00] uh does not consist of being old um um
[50:06] of uh you know it doesn't consist of
[50:08] older people
[50:10] only um you know uh uh you you you you
[50:14] would think that men and women who are
[50:17] up in age uh would be the ones that were
[50:21] wise and then you know the younger in
[50:23] age would lack the wisdom but that's not
[50:26] true all the
[50:27] time uh for job 32:9 it tells us and and
[50:33] listen to this this scripture but it
[50:35] tells us that great men are not always
[50:38] wise and neither do the Aged understand
[50:42] judgment and and so we we would look at
[50:47] Jesus for an example that the Bible says
[50:49] he was filled with wisdom and yet he was
[50:52] only 12 years old the Bible says as a
[50:55] child child he was filled with wisdom
[50:58] and he increased in wisdom and stature
[51:01] and in favor with God and man so then
[51:05] wisdom doesn't automatically come with
[51:08] with
[51:08] age uh uh for Paul even told the Hebrew
[51:13] church that the for the time that you
[51:16] you ought to be teachers you have need
[51:17] to be taught again and and so they they
[51:21] they they had been at a place that Paul
[51:23] would tell them you you should be at at
[51:26] a place to teach but uh uh you you're
[51:29] not there and and so in in Ephesians uh
[51:34] uh
[51:35] 1:16 Paul prayed that God would give
[51:38] unto us the spirit of wisdom and and uh
[51:43] so this is not that you you have to be
[51:47] uh you know 60 70 80 years old for this
[51:51] wisdom to come uh but but he says that
[51:55] he he prayed that he would give us the
[51:57] spirit of wisdom and the spirit of
[51:59] wisdom is none other than the spirit of
[52:02] truth it's the spirit of truth that
[52:04] Jesus promised to send in this last day
[52:08] and so brother Bram he would say this he
[52:10] said the spirit of wisdom comes into the
[52:13] church to make known to the church by
[52:17] the revelation of the Holy Ghost
[52:19] bringing the church in and revealing
[52:21] what day that we're living in just just
[52:25] the same as Gabriel come to Daniel the
[52:27] Holy Spirit comes to the church in the
[52:30] last days to reveal these great deep
[52:33] secret things ain't that right and so uh
[52:37] according to First John 5 and 20 uh he
[52:41] says the Son of God hath given on us an
[52:46] understanding that we may know him that
[52:49] is true so it is important that we have
[52:51] an understanding just as it was for John
[52:54] to have an understanding Amen to know of
[52:57] who Jesus was and for Jesus to even have
[53:01] an understanding as to John amen because
[53:04] if the word come to the prophet then
[53:06] Jesus had to know who he was that he was
[53:09] the word and that the prophet was upon
[53:12] Earth ain't that right he couldn't break
[53:14] the scriptures and go to the pope or go
[53:17] to some Bishop he went to a prophet
[53:19] ain't that right and so then John had to
[53:22] have this understanding well here the
[53:25] Son of God have given us an
[53:27] understanding that we may know him that
[53:29] is true and what and we are in him that
[53:35] is true ain't that right so where does
[53:38] this wisdom and understanding uh come
[53:42] from uh uh Psalms 119 uh actually tells
[53:46] us and it's a a pretty good uh uh uh uh
[53:50] chapter that we ought to to uh uh uh
[53:53] look at and but but but it says oh how I
[53:58] I love thy law and and he says it is my
[54:02] meditation all the day notice thou
[54:07] through thy Commandments which is Thy
[54:09] word h made me wiser than mine enemies
[54:14] for they are forever with me ain't that
[54:17] right so he kept the word of God with
[54:21] him at all times then 99 uh verse he
[54:25] says I have more understanding than all
[54:27] my teachers for thy testimonies of Thy
[54:31] word are my
[54:33] meditation I understand more than the
[54:35] Ancients because I keep thy precepts uh
[54:40] of Thy word ain't that right I have
[54:42] refrained my feet from every evil way
[54:45] that I might keep thy word I have not
[54:48] departed from thy judgments for thou
[54:50] Hast taught me see how sweet are thy
[54:53] words unto my taste yay sweeter than
[54:56] honey to my mouth through thy precepts
[55:00] Thy word I get understanding therefore I
[55:05] hate every false word or false way Thy
[55:09] word is a lamp to my feet and a light
[55:11] unto my path ain't that right so then it
[55:15] it would tell us how we get
[55:18] understanding and how amen we become
[55:21] wise and and these things and so uh this
[55:25] this wisdom it it it it actually it it
[55:28] it can come to all ages amen but it's
[55:32] it's again this wisdom doesn't come amen
[55:35] by being in movies and being in in video
[55:39] games and being in this and that and
[55:42] occupying our time out into the world
[55:44] and things but the wisdom comes by
[55:47] keeping the precepts and staying
[55:50] meditating upon the word of God ain't
[55:52] that right and and and and so so if if
[55:56] there is ever a a people on the Earth
[56:00] that has come to an understanding and
[56:03] who are wise it is the elect uh of today
[56:07] ain't that right more wise than any
[56:10] other people on the face of the Earth
[56:13] and and I'm not talking about worldly
[56:14] wisdom uh because that's that's what the
[56:17] children of the world have is that's the
[56:20] kind of wisdom that they have but but
[56:23] because the seals have been loosed and
[56:26] and the word has been made more clear
[56:29] than ever before in this age then we are
[56:34] a people that have a greater
[56:37] understanding a greater wisdom a greater
[56:40] knowledge as to uh uh what God has been
[56:44] after ain't that right so as Jesus said
[56:47] there in Matthew 3 or 13 and 17 verily I
[56:51] say unto you that many prophets and
[56:54] righteous men have desired to see those
[56:57] things which you see and have not seen
[57:00] them and to hear those things which you
[57:02] hear and have not heard them ain't that
[57:05] right see so the word spoke of John the
[57:08] word spoke of Jesus and and and the word
[57:12] that same word speaks of us today now
[57:17] you know and and we know these things
[57:20] but I pray that the Lord just really uh
[57:23] uh uh gets it into our our soul our
[57:26] being but in in Ephesians 1:23 Paul
[57:30] speaks of the church being the body of
[57:33] Jesus Christ and and the fullness of him
[57:37] and we've talked about you know uh uh
[57:39] how that the church is the mystical body
[57:42] of Jesus Christ and and that word
[57:45] mystical is is having a spiritual
[57:48] meaning or reality that is neither
[57:51] apparent to the senses or nor obvious to
[57:54] the intelligence amen it's involving or
[57:58] having the nature of an individual's
[58:00] direct subjective communion with God or
[58:05] Ultimate Reality so so we are the
[58:08] mystical body of Jesus Christ and and
[58:13] and and the relationship that the church
[58:15] has is is is the greater than than any
[58:19] other age I just believe that amen and
[58:22] and the the awareness of God is greater
[58:26] than any age because we are the body of
[58:30] Jesus Christ the body and so the ones
[58:33] who make up the body of course are the
[58:35] ones who've been baptized into the body
[58:38] by one spirit and as the prophet said
[58:40] it's not a water baptism it's a spirit
[58:43] baptism amen that puts the man into the
[58:47] body of Christ ain't that right and I I
[58:50] I I say to you that the body is the only
[58:54] body that God works in and lives in and
[58:58] is a reality amen uh uh uh in amen see
[59:04] so therefore we don't need his physical
[59:07] body we don't need that physical being
[59:10] to be on the earth and and how how
[59:12] wonderful that would have been to to to
[59:16] to to rub shoulders with Christ in his
[59:19] physical body and to sit there and to be
[59:22] able to talk and to communicate and and
[59:25] and and to shake his hand and to hear
[59:28] that voice and and all of that but how
[59:30] much greater is it than then we have it
[59:34] today simply because we are not just
[59:38] hearing his voice We Are The Voice amen
[59:41] for his voice is in us as it was in
[59:45] Jesus so it is in us and and we don't
[59:48] need to touch his body we are his body
[59:52] so the same life the same power The Same
[59:55] Spirit is in in US amen that was in him
[1:00:00] so so we don't need that physical body
[1:00:03] for he is and I'm not doing away with
[1:00:05] the body a man of Christ for we'll meet
[1:00:08] him in the air as the Bible says amen
[1:00:11] but I'm talking about on Earth amen but
[1:00:14] but Christ is the same in every aspect
[1:00:18] today than uh uh except the Corporal
[1:00:21] body can you say amen amen and so the
[1:00:24] purpose of his death at Calvary the
[1:00:27] prophet said was to save a sinner and
[1:00:30] produce to the church the power or the
[1:00:33] authority and the faith to do the same
[1:00:36] things that he did or to open up a heart
[1:00:39] and make a channel that himself could
[1:00:42] dwell in so that's the purpose of
[1:00:43] Calvary and if you have felt the effects
[1:00:46] of Calvary he only he he he allowed you
[1:00:49] to come into this and be for one one
[1:00:53] purpose and that is to make make you
[1:00:55] part of his body Amen to where he could
[1:00:58] have the preeminence can you say Amen so
[1:01:01] the mystical body of Jesus Christ is his
[1:01:04] own body that he himself has redeemed
[1:01:09] and therefore that makes us the channel
[1:01:12] we are the channel for God to work
[1:01:14] through we are his hands we are his eyes
[1:01:17] we are his lips we are his feet we are
[1:01:21] everything that he is we are that
[1:01:23] channel and so the same power that was
[1:01:26] manifested in that physical body of of
[1:01:30] of Christ is to be manifested in his
[1:01:33] mystical body do you believe that amen
[1:01:36] the same works that was done in his
[1:01:38] physical body is to be done through amen
[1:01:42] carried out in the mystical body amen so
[1:01:45] that God the same God and I may be
[1:01:48] repeating myself but I want to get it to
[1:01:50] us that the same God that lived in that
[1:01:53] body lives in the body today his
[1:01:56] mystical body and the body does not
[1:01:59] change the person or the personality
[1:02:02] ain't that right death doesn't change
[1:02:04] you it only changes your Dwelling Places
[1:02:07] but what you are amen here in this life
[1:02:10] you will be in that other life and so
[1:02:14] then then the the the church the Church
[1:02:17] of the Living God being the mystical
[1:02:19] body cannot change amen what God is it
[1:02:23] cannot change this person ality his
[1:02:25] nature his his power his his Essence
[1:02:28] amen it only amen reflects amen the life
[1:02:33] that is in it amen and so the body is
[1:02:37] actually under complete control absolute
[1:02:40] control of the life that is uh dwelling
[1:02:44] in it amen and so what God Was Before
[1:02:47] Time began never changed when he was
[1:02:51] manifested in the human body of Jesus
[1:02:54] Christ Christ and and so then uh today
[1:02:57] when we're looking at the body of Christ
[1:03:00] it is the only body amen where God can
[1:03:04] have complete
[1:03:06] preeminence in and operate in full ain't
[1:03:10] that right so now this testifies to me
[1:03:13] of the power of redemption and what God
[1:03:17] really done at Calvary amen see that God
[1:03:21] could take men and women who have this V
[1:03:25] um adamic nature that that it's a carnal
[1:03:29] nature Paul even says that it is not
[1:03:32] subject to the laws of God or the word
[1:03:34] of God neither can it indeed be amen it
[1:03:38] cannot be subject to that and yet he
[1:03:41] could redeem that group of people to
[1:03:44] where he could gain access in them and
[1:03:48] have complete preeminence in them amen
[1:03:53] so the m iCal body is a paradox because
[1:03:57] it is it is made up of people who were
[1:04:00] Misfits and and as the prophet would say
[1:04:03] born defeated we were born defeated but
[1:04:06] the power of redemption a and I I I
[1:04:10] think that's powerful because the Paul
[1:04:13] says I believe in Romans that we were we
[1:04:15] were Servants of sin we we were servants
[1:04:19] and I I think we could all uh vouch for
[1:04:21] that that that we were under the control
[1:04:24] of Satan and and whatever he wanted us
[1:04:26] to do we done it whether it be lying
[1:04:29] whether it be just a simple sin a a a wh
[1:04:32] lie to versus to Bad to the Bone or
[1:04:35] whatever we were all Servants of sin but
[1:04:38] we have been loosed by God's own blood
[1:04:41] to where we are free to be Servants of
[1:04:45] righteousness can you say amen and as
[1:04:47] the prophet said you know if it's
[1:04:49] perfect blood that has loosed us then it
[1:04:52] is a perfect loosening so your pardon is
[1:04:55] perfect your Redemption is perfect amen
[1:04:59] uh uh the transformation of your soul is
[1:05:02] perfect the seal that God put upon your
[1:05:06] life is a perfect seal amen it it cannot
[1:05:10] be undone so what we are is is not it's
[1:05:15] not a put on it's not something that we
[1:05:18] work ourselves into it's not something
[1:05:21] that we're imagining a ain't that right
[1:05:24] but there is a true reality to the power
[1:05:27] the blood of Jesus Christ now notice
[1:05:31] where we are today as the Church of
[1:05:33] Jesus Christ brother brandham says we
[1:05:35] believe as the church that the gospel
[1:05:38] has been just uh has has been just about
[1:05:41] completed we believe that the great
[1:05:43] Messengers Through the Ages has in these
[1:05:46] last days last several hundred years has
[1:05:48] fought for these great things the
[1:05:50] justification by faith Luther
[1:05:52] sanctification by Wesley the the baptism
[1:05:54] of the Holy Ghost by the Pentecostals we
[1:05:57] believe that those elements goals to
[1:06:00] make up the complete
[1:06:04] body amen so the body of Christ today is
[1:06:08] a complete body do you believe that it
[1:06:10] it's it's not just another phase of the
[1:06:12] body that we're in it's a completion of
[1:06:16] the body amen and and and you know uh uh
[1:06:20] 1 John 5:7 John would tell us for there
[1:06:24] are three that bear record in heaven and
[1:06:27] it's the Father the word and the Holy
[1:06:28] Ghost and these trees are one and as the
[1:06:31] prophet would tell us you can't have the
[1:06:33] father without having the son you cannot
[1:06:35] have the son without having the Holy
[1:06:36] Ghost for they are one if you've got the
[1:06:39] Holy Ghost you've got the father you got
[1:06:41] the son and be because they are one and
[1:06:44] he says and there are three that bear
[1:06:47] witness in Earth the spirit and the
[1:06:49] water and the blood and these agree in
[1:06:52] one ain't that right so you can be
[1:06:54] justified without being Sanctified you
[1:06:56] can be Sanctified without having the
[1:06:58] Holy Ghost and the prophet says the Holy
[1:07:01] Ghost is the indwelling presence of
[1:07:03] Christ's power in the spirit amen see
[1:07:07] and it's dwelling in the body of Christ
[1:07:10] amen see so and another place he says
[1:07:13] the natural types the spiritual so the
[1:07:16] church everybody say the church is in
[1:07:19] its complete maturity now this is where
[1:07:23] we're at this is the understanding that
[1:07:25] we have been given the church is in its
[1:07:28] complete maturity now justification
[1:07:31] sanctification the baptism of the Holy
[1:07:34] Ghost another place he says you to see
[1:07:37] down through the age we started off from
[1:07:39] the foundation from the first church age
[1:07:41] when the seed went in the ground the
[1:07:42] complete seed then it come out through
[1:07:44] the feet Luther come out and then
[1:07:46] through Wesley then into Pentecost the
[1:07:48] tongues and the lips and and now it's in
[1:07:51] the eyes prophetic of Malachi 4 and so
[1:07:53] forth
[1:07:54] now there's nothing else left for it to
[1:07:56] come but him himself to step into that
[1:08:00] cuz that's the last thing there is ain't
[1:08:03] that right and he's the intelligence see
[1:08:06] so the next is the intelligence we have
[1:08:08] no intelligence of our own it's his
[1:08:12] intelligence this is where the body is
[1:08:15] this is where we're at see we're not in
[1:08:17] the foot we're not in the in in the
[1:08:19] building of the body we're in the
[1:08:21] completion of the body it's it's
[1:08:23] standing complete we have no sight of
[1:08:26] our own how can a man foresee those
[1:08:28] things he can't do it it it's God
[1:08:30] himself it's becoming to a place and
[1:08:32] he's governed the body all the way
[1:08:34] through then the complete body of Christ
[1:08:38] is revealed in the form of a
[1:08:41] bride it's revealed can you say Amen so
[1:08:46] God has built a complete church that is
[1:08:50] in His image and and as we've said that
[1:08:54] this body has been hewed it's been
[1:08:56] chopped out by the prophet of Malachi 4
[1:09:00] it is a separate separated body from any
[1:09:03] other Church body or or any other body
[1:09:07] amen and and it's it's a body that is
[1:09:09] not been made up of Creeds and dogmas
[1:09:12] but it is a word body ain't that right
[1:09:16] it's it's not a body that is traditional
[1:09:20] in thoughts and and actions amen but
[1:09:24] it's it's a word body and every
[1:09:26] scripture concerning the church
[1:09:29] concerning the bride will be fulfilled
[1:09:33] in her and by her and through
[1:09:37] her praise the Lord and and so as the
[1:09:41] prophet said because this word body has
[1:09:44] come to its completion no man dare not
[1:09:48] must not add or take away from the word
[1:09:53] for to do so would be take away from the
[1:09:55] body ain't that right now brother
[1:09:57] brandham uh he he says in using God's
[1:10:00] word there's three things that a man
[1:10:02] must not do and I I I I think these
[1:10:05] things are important to us but we must
[1:10:08] not misinterpret the word we must not
[1:10:10] misplace the word and we must not
[1:10:12] dislocate the word he says if we do any
[1:10:15] of these things it throws the whole body
[1:10:17] in our Bible in confusion and Chaos so
[1:10:21] another place he says see to
[1:10:22] misinterpret Jes Jesus in the form of
[1:10:24] God in a man you would make him uh uh
[1:10:28] one God out of three to misinterpret
[1:10:31] Jesus Christ being the word you would
[1:10:33] make him one God out of three or you
[1:10:35] would make him the second person in a
[1:10:37] godhead and to do that you would mess up
[1:10:40] the whole scripture see You' never get
[1:10:44] nowhere so it must not be Mis
[1:10:47] interpreted if you say that a certain
[1:10:50] thing see you put an interpretation on
[1:10:52] it and you apply it to another time or
[1:10:55] it's been applied to another time you
[1:10:58] also make an incorrect interpreting amen
[1:11:02] so so I I want to apply this to our
[1:11:04] lives that no matter how insignificant
[1:11:07] that you may feel or we may look at
[1:11:10] ourselves and and think well it can
[1:11:13] never be well if you're the body of
[1:11:15] Christ every promise must be fulfilled
[1:11:18] through you as as a body so you cannot
[1:11:22] put that off to something else you have
[1:11:25] to accept it for what you are can you
[1:11:28] say amen and and so um uh another place
[1:11:33] brother Bram says Jesus himself is the
[1:11:35] interpretation of the Bible when he's
[1:11:38] made manifest in the age that the part
[1:11:42] of his body is being made manifest so if
[1:11:45] it's a hand age it must be a hand if if
[1:11:49] it's a head age see then or it can't be
[1:11:52] a head age if it's a voice age well it
[1:11:54] can't be a foot age and now we're at the
[1:11:57] I age and the next him next is him
[1:12:00] himself to come seeing prophetic can you
[1:12:03] say Amen so so we're we're we're we have
[1:12:06] this understanding as where we are as
[1:12:10] the body of Jesus Christ amen and I I
[1:12:15] pray that that understanding becomes
[1:12:18] enlightened to us amen see so EV every
[1:12:22] scripture in the Bible has the same
[1:12:25] application so you have to set it in its
[1:12:27] place the prophet said so to misplace
[1:12:30] the word he says then you might make him
[1:12:33] God of yesterday you could take it and
[1:12:36] say well yes he was God in with Samson
[1:12:38] he was God with David he was God in
[1:12:40] Christ he was God with Paul but then if
[1:12:43] you dislocate it uh or misplace it then
[1:12:46] you can take that same God Amen and make
[1:12:49] him a god of History amen you could view
[1:12:52] him as God God of yesterday but when you
[1:12:55] talk about him in this age then you can
[1:12:58] make him a god of history and that's to
[1:13:01] misplace the scriptures can you say Amen
[1:13:05] see to make him God in Christ and then
[1:13:07] not make him God in the church is to
[1:13:10] misplace the word amen to make him what
[1:13:13] Christ was he was in Christ in that day
[1:13:17] but then somehow to make God as though
[1:13:20] he doesn't do the things that he did
[1:13:22] back then is to misplace the word for
[1:13:25] the age that we're living in for Hebrews
[1:13:28] 13:8 it says Jesus Christ the same
[1:13:31] yesterday today and forever amen see so
[1:13:35] then to dislocate the scriptures is to
[1:13:39] disfigure the body of Christ see you you
[1:13:42] would put his body together wrong ain't
[1:13:44] that right you'd have the foot where the
[1:13:46] head should be and the head where you
[1:13:48] know the knee should be or or whatever
[1:13:51] see cuz you're dislocating the body
[1:13:54] but you you we're we're not a dislocated
[1:13:57] body can you say Amen so in other words
[1:14:00] brother Bram said see you you might have
[1:14:03] Jesus teaching Moses's message or Moses
[1:14:05] teaching Noah's message but see we're
[1:14:08] living in the bright time do you believe
[1:14:11] that we're living in Bride time we're
[1:14:13] living in seed time we're we're living
[1:14:15] in adoption time we're living in a time
[1:14:18] where the bride is to speak and when she
[1:14:21] speaks it's it's God's
[1:14:24] speaking that's true the Lord you know
[1:14:28] we have we have lived in the day of the
[1:14:30] stock tsle and Shu yes and the prophet
[1:14:34] said but we're back at Sea time the Lord
[1:14:37] so it's it's not that God is planting
[1:14:39] its seed like he did on the day of
[1:14:42] Pentecost but we are the seed that has
[1:14:44] ripened or is ripening amen ain't that
[1:14:47] right so when we look at it the stock
[1:14:50] the tossle the shuck they're dead yeah
[1:14:53] amen and and that tells us that the
[1:14:55] Lutheran you know they had a Revival at
[1:14:57] one time and and now now but now they're
[1:15:01] dead and and all those that sprung from
[1:15:04] that Lutheran Revival that they sit dead
[1:15:07] today and and they the they were
[1:15:09] branches off that Revival but they're
[1:15:12] dead the wans once had a Revival but
[1:15:14] they're dead the Pentecostals once had a
[1:15:16] Revival but but they're dead and they're
[1:15:18] formal ain't that right brother brother
[1:15:21] brandham in speaking to the Pentecostal
[1:15:23] he said the Holy Spirit today is
[1:15:24] rejecting the Pentecostals and you're
[1:15:27] getting just as formal and cold as the
[1:15:29] rest of them and everybody can see that
[1:15:31] ain't that right but see where we're at
[1:15:34] today is the Revival is in the bride and
[1:15:39] it it's a bride's Revival I I don't
[1:15:42] think it's ever been called a bride's
[1:15:43] Revival except for this day but it is a
[1:15:46] bride's Revival and and and notice where
[1:15:49] the the Revival's coming from Luke 17:30
[1:15:53] Malachi 45 and Matthew 25 Luke or
[1:15:57] Revelations 10 and 1-7 1 Thessalonians
[1:16:01] 4:16 and and on and on and on uh that
[1:16:05] these scriptures are are are bringing
[1:16:08] has brought a Revival to this bride
[1:16:11] because this is the age for it this is
[1:16:14] the time for it this is this is the the
[1:16:17] the thing we're we're not out of season
[1:16:20] we're not out of scripture amen we're
[1:16:22] we're not presenting another age this is
[1:16:25] the time that the bride is to rise up
[1:16:29] she is the Revival she becomes the
[1:16:32] Revival and up up until this time up
[1:16:35] until this age brother Bram said there's
[1:16:37] been no manifestation of God to steer
[1:16:40] the bride and and we know now that it
[1:16:43] took those seven unknown Thunders back
[1:16:46] there to wake her up again amen and and
[1:16:49] so uh uh and the Thunders is the voices
[1:16:53] a voice of God Amen so brother Brown
[1:16:56] said if I taught you a Methodist message
[1:16:58] it would it would take no effect on you
[1:17:00] this is bright time and and so this is
[1:17:03] why we're studying the message this is
[1:17:05] why we're we're getting in and and and
[1:17:07] and we're not bringing Baptist thoughts
[1:17:09] and Pentecostal thoughts and traditions
[1:17:13] and all of these things because it will
[1:17:14] not affect the bride amen but but you
[1:17:18] see he says if if Moses taught the
[1:17:20] message of Noah it would take no effect
[1:17:22] if Jesus taught Moses message it would
[1:17:24] take no effect because the predestinated
[1:17:28] seed are laying there that will only be
[1:17:31] watered by that type of water that's GI
[1:17:33] for that seed can you sayen notice
[1:17:37] another place he said the supernatural
[1:17:39] being with Divine Healing and powers and
[1:17:42] workings and so forth by The Miracles of
[1:17:45] God has put the bride in a Revival
[1:17:49] that's got oil in her lamp so who is the
[1:17:52] bride the wise virgin that's got all in
[1:17:55] her lamp and the supernatural being the
[1:17:58] Divine with Divine Healing and powers
[1:18:01] and working so forth by The Miracles of
[1:18:03] God has put the bride in a Revival prise
[1:18:06] the Lord ain't that right that's good
[1:18:09] now if you notice you know uh Jesus said
[1:18:12] as it was in the days of lot and
[1:18:15] something that that I you know it it
[1:18:19] could become uh common to us that that
[1:18:22] are in the message but to to Really to
[1:18:25] to to see of the understanding that God
[1:18:28] has given us at the world has no
[1:18:31] understanding of and and and that is
[1:18:35] about you know brother Brown talks about
[1:18:36] the Three Angels that appeared two went
[1:18:39] down to Sodom and preached to the
[1:18:41] sodomites and blinded them but one State
[1:18:45] uh uh one of that third messenger stayed
[1:18:48] behind with Abraham the elected group
[1:18:52] and and there's one thing that that
[1:18:55] happened that the world fails to
[1:18:57] recognize I think most people you know
[1:18:59] religious in Evangelical can say that
[1:19:02] we're living in the days of Sodom and
[1:19:04] and Gomorrah and the days of lot but but
[1:19:08] you know the thing that they failed to
[1:19:10] recognize and that was the last sign
[1:19:12] given to Abraham where God manifested in
[1:19:16] human flesh and told what Sarah was
[1:19:18] thinking in the tent behind him ain't
[1:19:21] that right and that was the last sign
[1:19:23] that was given to Abraham and of course
[1:19:26] Abraham was the type of this last day
[1:19:29] people who would go in a Rapture amen
[1:19:32] and and brother briam said see it was
[1:19:34] not Jesus that was speaking to Abraham
[1:19:36] for he had not yet been born but it was
[1:19:38] a man in human flesh that Abraham called
[1:19:43] Elohim the almighty God the
[1:19:45] self-existent one ain't that right now
[1:19:48] we we we we know uh that he later on
[1:19:51] become Jesus uh in in flesh amen but
[1:19:55] what Abraham was uh uh talking to was
[1:19:58] God Almighty in a theophany ain't that
[1:20:01] right a word body amen as a man that's
[1:20:05] right almighty God and and Paul would
[1:20:08] even tell us there in Hebrews 7 And1 for
[1:20:10] this MDC king of Salem priest of the
[1:20:13] most high God who met Abraham returning
[1:20:16] from the slaughter of the Kings and
[1:20:18] blessed him to whom also Abraham gave a
[1:20:21] tenth part of all first being by
[1:20:23] interpretation king of righteousness and
[1:20:26] after that also king of Salem which is
[1:20:29] king of peace without father Jesus had a
[1:20:32] you know father without mother can you
[1:20:34] say man without descent having neither
[1:20:37] beginning of days Jesus had beginning of
[1:20:39] days without ending of life but made
[1:20:43] like unto the Son of God abideth a
[1:20:46] priest continually ain't that right see
[1:20:49] so so we look and and then when God came
[1:20:52] came into Christ for the Bible says God
[1:20:55] was in Christ reconciling the world he
[1:20:57] performed the very same sign that he did
[1:21:01] in the body of
[1:21:02] MDC amen uh in in a to Abraham but then
[1:21:07] he promised that that same thing would
[1:21:10] happen again in this day ain't that
[1:21:13] right and if you notice because now I
[1:21:16] think this is um you know uh significant
[1:21:19] to you and I as the bride but it this
[1:21:22] sign would be what Jesus would call a
[1:21:25] resurrection sign it would be a a
[1:21:28] resurrection sign that Jesus has not
[1:21:30] been replaced but he has risen from the
[1:21:35] dead ain't that right it's a sign that
[1:21:38] God is here the same Jesus Christ is
[1:21:41] here today amen and and and Jesus would
[1:21:45] tell us there in Matthew 12 and and you
[1:21:48] know uh uh 38 then then C certain of the
[1:21:53] scribes and of the Pharisees answered
[1:21:54] saying Master we would see a sign from
[1:21:57] thee but he answered and said unto them
[1:21:59] an evil and adulterous generation
[1:22:01] seeketh after a sign brother Braham said
[1:22:03] now he's speaking prophetic of this age
[1:22:06] and there shall no sign be given to it
[1:22:09] but the sign of the Prophet Jonas for uh
[1:22:12] for as Jonah was three days and three
[1:22:15] nights in the whale's belly so shall the
[1:22:17] son of man be three days and three
[1:22:19] nights in the heart of the earth ain't
[1:22:21] that right amen see and and so uh uh
[1:22:26] he's prophesying of this generation and
[1:22:28] and again it fits with Luke 17:30 as it
[1:22:32] was in the days of lot so shall it be
[1:22:35] when the son of man is revealed can you
[1:22:38] say amen and and what is it the sign of
[1:22:42] the Resurrection will be the same sign
[1:22:45] that was performed in the days of lot to
[1:22:50] that elect amen and brother said that
[1:22:53] same spirit that was represented in
[1:22:55] human flesh that Abraham called Elohim
[1:22:58] is to be revealed again in human flesh
[1:23:03] do you believe that Amen in human flesh
[1:23:06] another place Elohim will return back to
[1:23:09] the Roy Seed of Abraham and show that
[1:23:12] same thing that he showed in that day
[1:23:15] Elohim as it was why it will be the
[1:23:19] characteristics of God it will be it
[1:23:23] will be the characteristics so this is
[1:23:25] what brother bram's Ministry was was the
[1:23:28] characteristics of God manifested
[1:23:32] showing that God is able to get
[1:23:35] preeminence in a
[1:23:38] bride yes three Messengers have come in
[1:23:41] this day brother brandom identified him
[1:23:44] as old Roberts and Billy Graham going to
[1:23:47] the
[1:23:48] denominations sodomites Pentecostals and
[1:23:52] whatever
[1:23:53] they preached repentance they blinded
[1:23:55] the eyes of the people spiritually but
[1:23:58] the third messenger has stayed with the
[1:24:00] elect and if there wasn't a word for
[1:24:03] that to happen again for our day then we
[1:24:06] we would we would no have no reason to
[1:24:09] believe in it but we believe solemnly in
[1:24:12] in in in in God's messenger for this age
[1:24:15] amen because we believe it was more than
[1:24:17] just a man that came to us that Pillar
[1:24:20] of Fire was God so MDC right same Jesus
[1:24:25] Christ and so we have been given the
[1:24:27] same sign which has revealed amen the
[1:24:31] son of man and and notice now what is
[1:24:34] the revealing of the son of man to do
[1:24:36] notice what brother Brown said to join
[1:24:38] the church to the head to unite the
[1:24:42] marriage of the
[1:24:43] Bride you see where we're at see what's
[1:24:47] happening this message is uniting us
[1:24:50] with Jesus Christ amen it's a marriage
[1:24:54] it's not a Reformation it's a
[1:24:57] marriage can you say Amen am see and he
[1:25:00] says the bridegroom call will come
[1:25:03] through this what the message the
[1:25:06] message is the bridegroom call the
[1:25:09] revealing of the son of man is the
[1:25:11] bridegroom
[1:25:13] call can you say Amen the shout is the
[1:25:16] bridegroom
[1:25:18] call Revelations 10:1 the mighty Angels
[1:25:21] crying out with a loud voice with the
[1:25:23] book in his hand is the bridegroom
[1:25:26] call it it's a bridegroom call this
[1:25:29] message is the bridegroom calling his
[1:25:34] elect and how do we know it's him how do
[1:25:37] we know it's it's really the bridegroom
[1:25:39] because he performed the Messiah
[1:25:42] sign that's good ain't that right see
[1:25:46] and he's come down in human flesh or he
[1:25:48] says see the bridegroom call will come
[1:25:50] right through this when the son of man
[1:25:52] will come down and come in human flesh
[1:25:55] to unite the two
[1:25:57] together the church has to be the word
[1:26:00] can you say that the church has to be
[1:26:02] the word word let's make it personal I
[1:26:05] have to be the word I have to be the
[1:26:07] word see just as John was the word and
[1:26:09] just as Jesus was the word amen they
[1:26:12] they fulfilled the word for their day
[1:26:15] and they had an understanding of who
[1:26:16] they were they even asked John are you
[1:26:19] that one he says no but I am that voice
[1:26:21] of one crying in the
[1:26:23] wilderness he took him to the word and
[1:26:25] showed that his ministry was the word
[1:26:28] well cannot we do the same thing in this
[1:26:30] age you bet we can we're not believing
[1:26:34] this message and just not knowing what
[1:26:35] we're believing we know what we're
[1:26:37] believing we know what it's doing to
[1:26:40] us yes sir it's more than just an
[1:26:43] excitement it's more than just an
[1:26:45] emotion it's scriptures being fulfilled
[1:26:48] I know they lay this emotion and all
[1:26:50] that's getting excited and all that
[1:26:51] because we get excited amen we are
[1:26:54] totally different than what the
[1:26:55] Pentecostals were you realize our
[1:26:58] shouting and our screaming and our
[1:27:00] dancing and our I mean our joy is
[1:27:02] scripture being
[1:27:04] fulfilled had nothing to do with about
[1:27:06] working up emotions and all we don't

[1:28:31] he says fill your flesh see self of all
[1:28:34] the Flesh of Mighty Men call The
[1:28:36] Marriage of the Lamb has come but the
[1:28:38] Rapture is going to the wedding supper

[1:29:04] with the bride of Jesus
[1:29:06] Christ I believe didn't you say amen God
[1:29:10] so he says they two become one and then
[1:29:13] what does it do it manifests the son of
[1:29:15] man
[1:29:16] again not the church theologians God

[1:29:22] loan

[1:29:53] the church that's me does the same thing
[1:29:58] the
[1:29:58] church praise the Lord so what is this
[1:30:01] what what what is the understanding it's
[1:30:04] it's the mystery made known Christ in
[1:30:06] you the hope of
[1:30:09] glory now brother Brown says now the
[1:30:12] church has the church now has served the
[1:30:15] term through the church age in the
[1:30:17] baptism of the Holy Ghost but Jesus said
[1:30:19] here to make Malachi 4 and the rest of
[1:30:21] these scriptures real to you see that in
[1:30:23] the last days just before the coming the
[1:30:25] world setting will be like the Sodom and
[1:30:28] the son of man and is not or we not in
[1:30:30] the setting of Sodom and Gomorrah
[1:30:32] absolutely we're we're in that setting
[1:30:34] and it's getting worse and worse
[1:30:36] absolutely see and and just before the
[1:30:39] coming the world be setting like Sodom
[1:30:41] and the son of man will reveal himself
[1:30:43] as the son of man like he did in the
[1:30:45] days of Sodom he said blind pers
[1:30:48] prosecutor can't you see that his words
[1:30:50] are true not nail scars and prins and
[1:30:52] Thorns it's the Son of God impersonated
[1:30:56] in his church as son of man it has to
[1:30:59] fulfill Malachi for and the rest of the
[1:31:01] scriptures can you say amen and he says
[1:31:04] see so he says I called to the Court's
[1:31:06] attention look at that real good son of
[1:31:09] man like like God the Father God the son
[1:31:11] God the Holy Ghost the same God three
[1:31:13] different attributes of the same God now
[1:31:15] this is the son of David son of man
[1:31:17] revealed then as a prophet son of David
[1:31:19] the king and now the son of God to the
[1:31:22] church age as God isn't man God is a
[1:31:25] spirit and the spirit son is the Holy
[1:31:28] Ghost which is revealing the church age
[1:31:30] so God was son of man Son of God through
[1:31:32] the church ages as Spirit but promised
[1:31:35] here in the last days that the son of
[1:31:37] man would be
[1:31:40] revealed God would become
[1:31:43] flesh a God would become flesh aren't
[1:31:47] you glad for that never a day has anyone
[1:31:51] f fulfilled all scriptures of this bride
[1:31:54] but you sit here tonight because God
[1:31:57] called you and by the the the revealing
[1:32:01] of the son of man and the ministry of
[1:32:03] the son of man God has now been able to
[1:32:06] take preeminence in US headship ain't
[1:32:10] that right that's right and so he says
[1:32:12] see he said blind Pro prosecutor do you
[1:32:15] get that I want you to know blind
[1:32:17] prosecutor we see it we believe it these
[1:32:19] words fulfilled before us and we know
[1:32:22] that they are true amen so then we go to
[1:32:25] the scripture that we know use quite
[1:32:28] often John 1419 yet a little while the
[1:32:31] world seeth me no more they have no
[1:32:33] understanding of him but you see me amen
[1:32:35] because I live you shall live also at
[1:32:37] that day you shall know that I'm in the
[1:32:39] father and ye in me and I in you all
[1:32:43] right can you say amen amen amen I love
[1:32:47] the Lord amen John 14:12 verily verily I
[1:32:50] say unto you Jesus says
[1:32:52] he that believeth on me the works that I
[1:32:53] do shall he do also greater than the
[1:32:56] shall he do because I go to my father
[1:32:59] think of that the greater has been
[1:33:01] promised to
[1:33:03] you amen ain't that right now brother
[1:33:06] brandom here he says now God has
[1:33:09] identified the resurrection of his son
[1:33:11] from the dead he's identified this
[1:33:14] Resurrection by given the church the
[1:33:17] same characteristics that he
[1:33:19] had making Hebrews 138 exactly
[1:33:23] right no wonder they can't convince us
[1:33:26] that God is dead they'll never be able
[1:33:29] to convince us that Jesus Christ is just
[1:33:31] nothing but
[1:33:32] historic no no no he's given us the sign
[1:33:36] of Resurrection
[1:33:37] amen identified the resurrection by
[1:33:40] giving the church the same
[1:33:42] characteristics that he had oh do you
[1:33:45] love him Hebrews 1 and one and I'll wind
[1:33:48] it down but God who had SU by times and
[1:33:52] in diverse manner spake in times P unto
[1:33:55] the fathers by the prophets hath in
[1:33:57] these last days spoken to us by his son
[1:34:01] whom he hath appointed heir of All
[1:34:02] Things by whom also he made the worlds
[1:34:05] notice he here he is Among Us the
[1:34:10] prophet said after 2,000 years the same
[1:34:13] Jesus not one of the
[1:34:18] prophets this is the ministry that of of
[1:34:22] brother brandham that is to me so
[1:34:25] powerful because it's not just another
[1:34:28] Ministry of one of the
[1:34:31] prophets but it's actually the ministry
[1:34:33] of Jesus Christ raised from the
[1:34:37] dead can you say Amen Lord the same
[1:34:41] Ministry that Jesus had is the same
[1:34:43] Ministry that the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:34:45] has
[1:34:46] today and this is why Mark 11 is so
[1:34:50] personal to to us and it should be it's
[1:34:53] the only
[1:34:55] time that the scripture has been made
[1:34:59] known or or
[1:35:01] unfolded to really what Jesus was saying
[1:35:04] was in this day but I'm going to read it
[1:35:07] as we close but Mark 11:11 and Jesus
[1:35:10] entered into Jerusalem and into the
[1:35:12] temple when he had looked around about
[1:35:14] upon all things and now the evening tide
[1:35:17] was come and he went out unto Bethany
[1:35:20] with the 12
[1:35:22] and on the marrow when they were come
[1:35:23] from Bethany he was hungry and Jesus and
[1:35:27] seeing a fig tree a far off having
[1:35:29] leaves he came if happily he might find
[1:35:33] anything there on and when he came to it
[1:35:35] he found nothing but leaves for the time
[1:35:37] of figs was not yet and Jesus answered
[1:35:39] and said unto it no man eat fruit of
[1:35:42] thee uh Hereafter forever and his
[1:35:45] disciples heard it and they come to
[1:35:47] Jerusalem and Jesus went into the temple
[1:35:50] and began to cast them out
[1:35:52] that sold and bought in the temple and
[1:35:54] overthrew the tables of the money
[1:35:56] changers and the seats of them that
[1:35:58] sowed doves and I'm going to go on down
[1:36:01] to the 19th verse and when even was come
[1:36:04] he went out of the city and in the
[1:36:06] morning they passed by they saw the fig
[1:36:08] tree dried up from the roots and Peter
[1:36:11] calling to remembrance Sith unto him
[1:36:13] Master behold the Fig Tree which thou
[1:36:15] cursed is withered away and Jesus
[1:36:18] answering and said unto them have faith
[1:36:22] God I like that have faith of God he's
[1:36:27] talking to a
[1:36:28] body he's talking to a group of people
[1:36:31] that's going to be his body one day
[1:36:33] right and they would possess the very
[1:36:36] same faith that he had they would
[1:36:40] possess the same because it'd be the
[1:36:42] same God living in him that would live
[1:36:44] in them so have faith in God or have the
[1:36:48] faith of God for verily I say to you
[1:36:51] that whosoever shall say un this
[1:36:53] mountain be thou removed and be thou
[1:36:54] cast into the sea and shall not doubt in
[1:36:57] his heart but shall believe that those
[1:36:58] things which he says shall come to pass
[1:37:00] he shall have everybody say he shall
[1:37:02] have whatsoever he saith he shall have
[1:37:06] whatsoever he saith therefore I say unto
[1:37:09] you what what things soever you desire
[1:37:11] When you pray believe that you receive
[1:37:13] them and you shall have them ain't that
[1:37:16] right so what we are I I think this is
[1:37:20] uh we are the channel as his body we are
[1:37:23] the channel for the word to come we're
[1:37:26] the channel now brother brandom I'm
[1:37:29] going to read this uh but he says now if
[1:37:33] we could throw ourself completely to God
[1:37:38] and to his will and be lost to our own
[1:37:41] thoughts and just let the mind of Christ
[1:37:43] be in US them same operations of the
[1:37:46] spirit would work through us just as the
[1:37:48] Natural Things does just the same thing
[1:37:52] because we were first created for that
[1:37:54] purpose to control to rule and to praise
[1:37:58] God and to live for God that's what you
[1:38:00] were made for that's what the that's the
[1:38:02] reason you were created was to rule to
[1:38:05] control and to praise God and to serve
[1:38:09] God that's what we were made for now
[1:38:12] Jesus said if you abide in me and my
[1:38:14] words abide in you you can ask what you
[1:38:16] will and it shall be given to you if you
[1:38:20] abide in me and my word in
[1:38:22] you now the father and his word is
[1:38:25] inseparable because the word is his son
[1:38:27] in the beginning was the word the word
[1:38:29] was with God the Word was God and the
[1:38:31] Word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us
[1:38:33] and God and His word is inseparable you
[1:38:36] cannot have god without having his word
[1:38:38] and when you have his word you have God
[1:38:41] prise the Lord and if you notice we're
[1:38:43] coming back to word made flesh
[1:38:45] again if you want to go back a little
[1:38:48] further just as far as historical you
[1:38:50] could see the word in the beginning was
[1:38:52] the word but what is the word a word is
[1:38:55] a thought manifested a thought spoken
[1:38:57] forth God first he perceived the thought
[1:39:00] and spoke it and it and and it become a
[1:39:02] word and the word become material so
[1:39:05] everything that God has spoke in his
[1:39:07] word received into the right channel
[1:39:10] will materialize that word for whatever
[1:39:13] the promise behind it is God will do it
[1:39:16] he's obligated amen be the channel that
[1:39:21] the word can come through can you say
[1:39:23] Amen bless name so then if you abide in
[1:39:26] me and my word abide in you and other
[1:39:29] words you're that
[1:39:30] channel see then you have God the word
[1:39:35] in you yes and you believe the word just
[1:39:39] as you believe God because it is God and
[1:39:41] it's Inseparable then if you have God's
[1:39:44] word in you you have God's life in you
[1:39:47] you have God in you and whatever God's
[1:39:51] word speaks forth out of
[1:39:54] [Music]
[1:39:55] you it'll have to come to pass just like
[1:39:58] it was spoke from God think about it
[1:40:01] praise the Lord isn't that awesome yes
[1:40:02] it is true Jesus said whatsoever you ask
[1:40:06] the father in my name I'll do it did you
[1:40:08] ever realize what that means do you
[1:40:10] realize that if we go before God In The
[1:40:12] Name of Jesus it's just the same as
[1:40:14] Jesus himself
[1:40:16] praying it isn't me praying anymore if I
[1:40:19] come in his name he recognizes his name
[1:40:22] and Jesus said whatever you ask the
[1:40:25] father in my name that I
[1:40:27] do right is that a promise sure it is
[1:40:31] then I go to the father in jesus' name
[1:40:33] it isn't me praying anymore it's Jesus
[1:40:36] it's his Spirit praying through meise
[1:40:39] Lord that I've got to receive what I
[1:40:42] asked for because he said it and it's
[1:40:44] God's Own word it can't do nothing else
[1:40:47] but produce just what it said amen ain't
[1:40:50] that right right amen so then we believe
[1:40:53] see then this is the confidence that we
[1:40:55] have in God that we get what we ask for
[1:40:57] for he's God and cannot take back his
[1:40:59] word he's got to stay with his word if
[1:41:02] the musicians will come stay with his
[1:41:04] word so he says then if you abide in me
[1:41:06] and my words abide in you ask what you
[1:41:08] will and it'll be given unto you isn't
[1:41:10] that
[1:41:13] simple Faith
[1:41:15] created see we was made for that
[1:41:19] purpose
[1:41:21] I hope you understand tonight you were
[1:41:25] not made to be defeated amen you were
[1:41:27] not made to go down in defeat you were
[1:41:30] not made for
[1:41:33] hell you were not made for the
[1:41:35] tribulation you were not made you were
[1:41:37] made to rule to control to praise God
[1:41:40] and to live for God that's what you were
[1:41:43] made for amen I
[1:41:45] believe ain't that
[1:41:47] right and so this is what the message is
[1:41:50] doing is what God has done through the
[1:41:52] message of the hour is to bring you back
[1:41:54] to Sons and Daughters of God that's
[1:41:56] right it had to take the seven unnown
[1:41:59] Thunders to wake us up yes
[1:42:02] right to bring us back into our right
[1:42:06] position as Sons and Daughters of God
[1:42:08] the way we were created to so all the
[1:42:12] challenges that you face is not to bring
[1:42:14] you down it's for you to rule to control
[1:42:18] and to praise God in that's good
[1:42:21] ain't that right yes sir so see he says
[1:42:24] see isn't that simple Faith created we
[1:42:26] was made for that purpose then through
[1:42:27] the fall why we was taken away from that
[1:42:30] and then in Redemption we was brought
[1:42:33] back to it
[1:42:34] again we talk about the seals we talk
[1:42:37] about the Redemption claims remp
[1:42:41] claims what's it for to bring us
[1:42:45] back into Sons and Daughters of God
[1:42:49] again
[1:42:51] amen the only thing that hindered the
[1:42:53] human race today from being Superior and
[1:42:56] controlling like they did in the
[1:42:57] beginning is because that the power
[1:43:00] lines of the outlet of God made in the
[1:43:02] human being has been clogged up and he
[1:43:05] said sometimes the all Theology and
[1:43:07] church doctrines have clogged up your
[1:43:09] faith line clogged up your lines till
[1:43:12] you have been taught that those things
[1:43:15] can't be and that puts a block in the
[1:43:18] way
[1:43:19] see that's That's what Satan has done
[1:43:22] through doctrines of men and Theology
[1:43:24] and all that
[1:43:25] stuff but he said could you imagine this
[1:43:28] building here being energized tonight
[1:43:30] for light by the electricity the
[1:43:33] electricity is an unseen Force when it's
[1:43:35] harnessed and brought on when Benjamin
[1:43:37] FR Franklin first found it he screamed
[1:43:40] I've got it yet he didn't know what he
[1:43:41] had he had something but Along come
[1:43:44] Edison and put it to work and today we
[1:43:46] can send a wireless program from right
[1:43:49] this place here to anywhere around the
[1:43:51] world by Wireless telegram see and look
[1:43:54] everything else that we got today right
[1:43:56] see it's an unseen force that moves it
[1:43:59] through space that no man can catch it
[1:44:01] only Machinery can catch it because it's
[1:44:04] too fast for the eye but yet there's a
[1:44:06] force that there's telegrams coming
[1:44:08] right through this room right now he
[1:44:10] said now if the law natural laws of God
[1:44:13] which is electricity and things once
[1:44:14] handed in the right capacity can do
[1:44:16] those things how much more could the
[1:44:18] power of the Holy Ghost once passing
[1:44:20] through to the human heart by faith what
[1:44:22] it could
[1:44:25] do we're enjoying what man has been able
[1:44:28] to accomplish with the electricity but
[1:44:30] what can God accomplish through us the
[1:44:33] power of God flowing through us get all
[1:44:35] the clogs out of the way may we have an
[1:44:39] understanding today tonight of what God
[1:44:41] is really called us to do and where
[1:44:43] we're standing today can you say Amen
[1:44:47] might have been fine one day just to
[1:44:49] come to church and en join a church
[1:44:50] Church it might have been fine because
[1:44:52] that's all the light they had they had
[1:44:54] the only light they had was you know
[1:44:56] that Jesus was savior you know and I
[1:44:59] think that's the way brother brandham
[1:45:00] said it you know and and things like
[1:45:03] that but that's all the light they had
[1:45:04] but our understanding has been so
[1:45:06] increased in this age to know that the
[1:45:09] word will work for us if we'll just be
[1:45:11] the conductor for we are the body don't
[1:45:15] look to something else don't look for
[1:45:16] someone else look at yourself God has
[1:45:19] put you on this Earth and has brought
[1:45:21] you in to be part of this body for the
[1:45:24] word to flow through you take your lips
[1:45:26] take your eyes Take Your Vessel and let
[1:45:29] the word flow through can you say Amen
[1:45:32] oh do you love the
[1:45:34] Lord so he says see God has not promised
[1:45:37] us electricity only just might have set
[1:45:41] them free but look what the Holy Spirit
[1:45:44] has promised to the believer today then
[1:45:47] we look back and see that God put
[1:45:48] electricity here for a certain thing and
[1:45:51] science is moving into the field of
[1:45:53] science and bringing it out but we as
[1:45:55] Christians we become too clogged up we
[1:45:58] just can't understand we think about
[1:45:59] well the doctor said I can't get well
[1:46:02] and as long as you think that then
[1:46:03] you're not thinking God's thoughts see
[1:46:06] you can't do it see if you say well I'm
[1:46:09] going to die the doctor said I was going
[1:46:10] to die well all regards to the doctor
[1:46:12] that's the best of his knowledge if he
[1:46:14] said you're going to die see humanly
[1:46:17] speaking well I believe the same thing
[1:46:19] but by the word word I can't believe
[1:46:23] it he's right in what he's saying
[1:46:26] humanly speaking but there is a
[1:46:29] word that if that word can have
[1:46:32] preeminence and we become the channel of
[1:46:35] not what the doctor says better channel
[1:46:38] for what God says we won't believe what
[1:46:40] that doctor
[1:46:43] says ain't that
[1:46:45] right amen you love the Lord love the
[1:46:49] Lord so he said if you was going to die
[1:46:50] he say but by the word I can't believe
[1:46:52] it that's right because he promised me
[1:46:54] that whatever I asked the father in his
[1:46:55] name would be granted and I believe
[1:46:57] that's the truth now if God could just
[1:46:59] clear that little Channel out and run
[1:47:03] that energy out to that place then
[1:47:06] something going to happen then you don't
[1:47:08] have to fear cancer you don't have to
[1:47:11] fear arthritis you don't have to fear
[1:47:13] what the devil's trying to put on you
[1:47:15] and your family and and everything else
[1:47:18] just be the channel for God to flow

[1:56:00] those that are sick in our prayer and U
[1:56:04] sickness going
[1:56:05] around and uh so we want to keep
[1:56:08] everyone here
[1:56:11] um in our prayer remember brother Joe
[1:56:15] sister Bernardine and her
[1:56:17] family and um
[1:56:20] from what I've heard this was the the
[1:56:22] man that we had prayed for two years ago
[1:56:25] wasn't it I fell off the roof and broke
[1:56:29] most of I guess a lot of his
[1:56:31] bones and uh took him two years to
[1:56:34] recover
[1:56:36] just just started recovering to where he
[1:56:39] could get out but the Lord took
[1:56:43] him um
[1:56:46] home
[1:56:47] um yesterday last night I guess and so
[1:56:52] we certainly want to
[1:56:54] remember the family in our
[1:56:56] prayer and um remember his wife as well
[1:57:02] uh she was in the she was with in the
[1:57:05] wreck but um from what I heard that
[1:57:09] she's broken a couple fingers or
[1:57:11] something like that and her wrist and
[1:57:15] different things and so but they've let
[1:57:17] her go home but you could imagine in the
[1:57:19] grief that she's in and uh just
[1:57:23] devastated and I'm sure so we want to
[1:57:25] keep them in prayer keep Steve Brumfield
[1:57:29] in our prayer they had to totally
[1:57:31] reconstruct his foot and uh it was a 3H
[1:57:37] hour surgery I think maybe longer and so
[1:57:41] he is just in tremendous pain and um um
[1:57:48] supposed to uh I think they're going to
[1:57:51] try to put a cast on uh
[1:57:53] Monday and uh but he just in so much
[1:57:56] pain all he can do is lay around and
[1:57:59] that's what the doctor told him to do is
[1:58:01] lay around and so and Steve's not that
[1:58:04] kind of a person just to lay around so
[1:58:07] it's been a little rough on him and uh
[1:58:11] tried to tried to get up and he fa
[1:58:13] yesterday and and um and so caused him
[1:58:18] put pressure on that foot
[1:58:20] so he' been in a lot of pain so we want
[1:58:21] to keep him in our prayer keep Sister
[1:58:24] Kim in our prayer and that God will just
[1:58:27] help him and help her amen and so lot to
[1:58:32] pray about in there but we certainly
[1:58:34] know a God Amen that answers the prayers
[1:58:38] so God bless you keep your head up amen
