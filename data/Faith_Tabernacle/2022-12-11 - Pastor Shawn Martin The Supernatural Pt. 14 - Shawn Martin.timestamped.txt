[36:33] chapter
[36:35] um
[36:41] praise the Lord
[36:45] and
[36:47] just going to start at the 22nd verse
[36:51] and read the two verses there
[36:56] it says and hath put all things under
[36:58] his feet
[37:00] and gave him to be the head over all
[37:03] things to the church
[37:05] which is his body
[37:07] the fullness of him
[37:09] that filleth all in all
[37:13] amen let's just bow our heads and talk
[37:16] to our Lord father
[37:19] we're so thankful
[37:21] that you have given us the ability the
[37:25] desire the grace to come to your house
[37:29] Lord to worship you we're so thankful
[37:32] Lord for the health
[37:35] that you've blessed us with father
[37:38] thank you for the desire Lord and
[37:42] waking us up Lord in our right minds and
[37:46] just a heart to serve you today
[37:50] Lord we certainly don't want to take
[37:52] that for granted
[37:54] we just asked that you would just be
[37:56] with us today and anoint this part of
[38:00] the service Lord
[38:02] and ask that you would just speak
[38:04] through me father to your people
[38:07] and father May the hearts and ears of
[38:10] your people just be anointed to receive
[38:13] and if there be any unbelief in each
[38:18] spirit that would try to hinder I pray
[38:20] that you would drive it from this place
[38:23] Lord
[38:24] Lord we just love you and thank you in
[38:27] Jesus Christ's name amen
[38:31] you can have your seeds I do want to
[38:33] read this card it says in our Busy World
[38:37] each good thought word and act makes a
[38:41] difference
[38:42] and it says in more ways than you know
[38:45] that's the difference you make for me
[38:47] thanks
[38:48] thank you for all your prayers texts and
[38:52] cards from the Jones family
[38:56] and so we want to continue
[38:59] praying for brother Johnny and sister
[39:03] Carolyn and the family
[39:05] as they um
[39:07] you know it's not easy losing a loved
[39:10] one
[39:11] and
[39:12] um and I'm sure there'll be
[39:16] days you know where they're going to
[39:18] need our prayer
[39:20] and so we want to just keep them in
[39:22] prayer the Lord will just Comfort them
[39:25] be with them and help them throughout
[39:28] the days to come amen
[39:31] I want to again talk on the supernatural
[39:36] and um
[39:38] you know one thing about God is that God
[39:42] is perfect
[39:43] and his way is perfect
[39:46] and his actions are perfect
[39:49] his thoughts are perfect and I think
[39:52] it's in first Samuel or second Samuel 22
[39:57] 31
[39:58] but it says as for God his way is
[40:01] perfect
[40:02] and so with that then that tells us that
[40:06] what God done in the beginning what he
[40:09] started out with
[40:10] then he he'll continue to do that if he
[40:15] never changes his mind
[40:17] on anything and so if God was called on
[40:21] the scene to to save the first man then
[40:26] however he chose to save that man
[40:30] he's going to save everyone just the
[40:32] same
[40:33] if he healed the first man on the basis
[40:38] of faith
[40:39] then I promise you he'll heal everyone
[40:43] else on the basis of faith and he can't
[40:46] do any other way because that's his way
[40:50] and he doesn't learn as he goes uh he's
[40:55] perfect
[40:56] so then it's it's a perfect action it's
[41:00] a perfect thought it's it's not
[41:02] increasing in learning and increasing in
[41:05] techniques as man is doing today
[41:08] but it's it's it's it's it's always the
[41:12] perfect it's it's the best way ain't
[41:14] that rhyme so what God desired then as
[41:18] in a prayer as a perfect God perfect
[41:21] thought than what he desired in the
[41:24] beginning that desire is still the same
[41:27] it'll never change he can't change I
[41:30] don't care how many unbelievers there
[41:32] are I I don't care how many Skeptics
[41:34] you'll you'll never be able to change
[41:36] God
[41:37] now the Bible says that man changed him
[41:40] as uh uh they're in Romans the first
[41:44] chapter that that they they they changed
[41:47] him but not not in his nature not in his
[41:52] Essence not not in the way he is they
[41:55] just changed him in their own
[41:57] imagination
[41:59] and and and the church world is doing
[42:02] that today uh
[42:05] uh The Sinner the ungodly they're
[42:07] they're they're they're changing God but
[42:10] but we're people that that says that God
[42:12] can't change
[42:13] and I don't want to be in that in that
[42:15] in that in that uh stand in that
[42:18] position to try to change God
[42:20] not in my mind I don't want to change
[42:23] God in my mind I I don't want to change
[42:25] who he is in my heart uh because I'll be
[42:29] the only uh uh well I'll be the fool
[42:31] I'll be the one that's that believe in a
[42:34] lie because God can never change ain't
[42:37] that right and so uh Perfection cannot
[42:40] progress anymore because it's already
[42:43] perfect ain't that right so the prophet
[42:46] said so he don't have to say well this
[42:48] is a different age and we got a better
[42:51] thought now well if it is he can't be
[42:54] God see so if he is God what he spoke
[42:58] back there he has to stay with it
[43:00] because he was perfect there and he's
[43:04] perfect now do you believe that so so
[43:07] then we're going to look there at in the
[43:11] book of Acts amen uh God laid the
[43:15] foundation for his church in the book of
[43:17] Acts Amen on the day of Pentecost says
[43:20] is when the church was birthed a man
[43:22] inaugurated so however God started that
[43:25] church it's still today however God
[43:28] whatever God done in that church is
[43:30] still applicable for today that's the
[43:33] standard for the church today if if if
[43:37] if the works of God isn't isn't being
[43:40] done in the church today amen then then
[43:42] we're below the standards the church is
[43:45] below the standard ain't that right amen
[43:47] that's right because there ain't no
[43:49] there ain't no better way so so then in
[43:52] the days of Acts God laid an Apostolic
[43:55] Foundation a man there was an Apostolic
[43:59] Faith there was an Apostolic Doctrine
[44:03] there was an Apostolic baptism there was
[44:07] Apostolic gifts a man that was in that
[44:11] first church ain't that right which
[44:14] means that that the faith the doctrine
[44:17] the baptism uh uh of it was of the
[44:22] Apostles Apostolic is when we say
[44:25] Apostolic that's that's where it was it
[44:27] was of the Apostles it was the faith of
[44:29] the Apostles it was the doctrine of the
[44:31] Apostles it was it was the gifts that
[44:34] that was uh uh uh uh worked through the
[44:37] apostles and and so uh uh that that's so
[44:42] we would call that Apostolic gifts or
[44:44] whatever but that was the foundation of
[44:47] the church it was an Apostolic Church a
[44:50] Pentecostal Church ain't that right and
[44:53] and so uh uh what the apostles had what
[44:57] they taught what they did was Apostolic
[45:01] amen that's right a lot of the
[45:03] apostolics though we got named Apostolic
[45:05] like we've got name Pentecostal but but
[45:08] and and they're so far from Apostolic uh
[45:12] because what the apostles done amen that
[45:16] was the foundation of the uh for the
[45:18] church today ain't that right so so uh
[45:22] uh brother Branham says you know the
[45:24] doctrine of the Apostles what was that
[45:27] Doctrine it was authoritative word ain't
[45:31] that right amen so they weren't teaching
[45:34] their their own ideas they weren't
[45:36] teaching Doctrine from a rule book cold
[45:38] book a man it was authoritative word
[45:41] straight from God ain't that right so
[45:44] that's what Apostolic Doctrine is so
[45:47] you'll never find trinitarian in an
[45:49] Apostolic Doctrine you'll never find
[45:51] even even uh Jesus name the way they
[45:55] they they put themselves as as as such
[45:59] uh uh today uh Oneness you know
[46:02] um uh there's there's the rawness and
[46:05] then there's the trinitarian and then
[46:06] there's the bride right in the middle of
[46:08] all this you know and and yes we are
[46:10] Oneness but we we don't believe that the
[46:13] flesh was deity ain't that right amen
[46:15] God was all all man and he was all God
[46:18] that Jesus was right and so so we we
[46:21] find that there's that Apostolic
[46:23] Doctrine amen and so uh an authoritative
[46:28] word amen then is it would be contrary
[46:32] to the apostolic Doctrine the doctrine
[46:35] of the Apostles amen now we we find in
[46:40] the days of the Apostles the Bible says
[46:43] that God added to the church daily as
[46:48] such as should be saved ain't that right
[46:50] now that's Apostolic Doctrine right
[46:53] there and that's apostolic faith that
[46:55] God added to the church daily as such as
[46:59] should be saved see so that's Apostolic
[47:02] uh uh the Apostle the apostles didn't
[47:05] accept anyone and everyone as as
[47:08] Christians as they do today amen for God
[47:12] is the one that would add to the church
[47:15] such as should be saved and if God
[47:18] didn't add a person to the church church
[47:20] then they just weren't part of the
[47:22] church you understand what I'm saying
[47:24] amen you see there was a standard that
[47:27] was set for the for for for uh the
[47:31] Christians of that day amen it wasn't
[47:34] all these kinds of wacky doctrines that
[47:36] we have today there was one Doctrine
[47:38] there was one Faith there was one
[47:40] baptism ain't that right there was one
[47:43] belief amen and so uh uh someone trying
[47:47] to bring that in the church amen they
[47:49] would say well that's that's not the
[47:51] church that you're not part of the
[47:52] church it's it's it's not something
[47:55] there you know and and uh you know today
[47:58] uh uh so many people just don't want to
[48:01] hurt other people's feelings and so that
[48:04] they'll you know that we we accept uh
[48:07] septum as a brother or sister and then
[48:10] have to put up with all the junk that
[48:12] they bring in the church we put up with
[48:14] their division amen uh their disrespect
[48:16] we put up with the confusion that they
[48:18] bring into the church we put up up with
[48:21] all the bellyaching and the backbiting
[48:23] and and all these things but when it was
[48:25] in the beginning at the apostolic of the
[48:29] Apostles them things weren't to happen
[48:31] amen uh you you had people that that
[48:35] were liars and and trying to deceive and
[48:38] and and then you find out what happened
[48:40] the ananias and sapphires the Holy Ghost
[48:42] moved amen and and uh up on Peter and
[48:46] and God struck them dead ain't that
[48:48] right well see that was Apostolic see
[48:52] and and so there is an Apostolic
[48:55] standard a man even for today the
[48:59] Apostle Paul says mark them which caused
[49:01] division among you see so so you know
[49:05] the apostles didn't believe in being
[49:07] part saved and and part Center and and
[49:10] and like like people do today uh
[49:13] confessing oh I'm a Christian I'm a
[49:14] Christian and still drinking and still
[49:16] lying and still cussing and still
[49:18] dividing and still uh uh uh causing
[49:22] trouble Lynn and and and smoking and and
[49:26] women wearing their britches and cutting
[49:28] her hair and you you understand what I'm
[49:31] saying amen them things weren't now then
[49:33] things didn't happen back then amen
[49:36] because there was a standard and it was
[49:38] God the one that added to the church
[49:40] such as should be saved a man sold the
[49:43] apostles back then didn't believe in
[49:45] Heaven one foot in the world and one
[49:48] foot in the church them things just
[49:50] didn't happen amen see and so uh uh you
[49:54] know it's like the prophet said you know
[49:56] when it's night outside well then it's
[49:58] dark it's it's yeah yeah yeah you know
[50:01] you you don't uh you you don't say well
[50:04] how much of it is dark and and how much
[50:06] of it is light well it's it's all dark
[50:09] it's night outside ain't that right see
[50:11] and and so uh brother Brandon said well
[50:14] if you are a Believer then you are a
[50:16] Christian and if you're not a Believer
[50:19] then you're not a Christian gin ain't
[50:21] that right see that that's Apostolic
[50:24] that's that's what it was back in the
[50:25] first day of the first church age is is
[50:29] if you're Christian then we expect you
[50:31] to be a Christian we expect actions of a
[50:33] Christian we expect you to be on fire
[50:35] for God we expect you to be working for
[50:38] the kingdom of God we we expect you to
[50:40] support the kingdom of God we expect
[50:42] these things as a Christian can you say
[50:45] amen amen even the prophet got on to the
[50:48] people of of you know supporting radio
[50:51] stations that was totally against
[50:52] Pentecostal doctrines amen why would the
[50:55] Pentecostals amen support things that
[50:57] would condemn Miracles and we would
[51:00] condemn Holiness and would condemn
[51:02] whatever see and you support that stuff
[51:05] well the apostles wouldn't support that
[51:07] can you say amen that's exactly right so
[51:10] so we find uh uh that that if you notice
[51:14] you're not saved by Good Works amen
[51:17] you're not saved by shouting and they're
[51:20] talking and what Apostolic right you're
[51:22] not saved by speaking in tongues you're
[51:25] not saved by keeping the Sabbath you're
[51:27] not saved on the basis of eating meat or
[51:30] whether you eat or not eat meat you're
[51:33] not saved amen by joining a church
[51:36] you're not saved by water baptism you
[51:40] know uh uh uh them sayings are not
[51:43] Apostolic doctrine of what it used to be
[51:47] you understand what I'm saying say man
[51:49] so either either people are teaching
[51:52] these things and saying they're blessed
[51:54] of God they're highly favored of God and
[51:56] and if if that be the case then then
[51:59] let's admit it God had to change because
[52:01] he did not build the church in that way
[52:04] he did not build a Doctrine there and
[52:08] establish that church on such doctrines
[52:10] as such as these things can you say amen
[52:13] amen see they weren't legalists back
[52:15] then God would add to the church and
[52:18] there was a great grace upon them and
[52:20] amen and and these things a man in
[52:23] Ephesians 2 and 8 the Apostle Paul says
[52:26] by Grace everybody saved by grace are
[52:29] you saved through faith and that not of
[52:33] yourselves it is the gift of God can you
[52:36] say Amen so then uh uh we find that
[52:39] there is a true salvation there is a
[52:43] true salvation and that's when God gets
[52:45] a hold of a man God gets a hold of a a
[52:48] boy a girl woman a man and he and he
[52:51] brings them into his church after all
[52:54] it's his church ain't that right this is
[52:57] just a building right here amen and and
[52:59] this don't mean we're part of his church
[53:01] amen you've got to be baptized into his
[53:04] church by God's spirit ain't that right
[53:06] amen and then if you're truly saved now
[53:10] now think of this if you're truly saved
[53:12] you you well then then you speak with
[53:14] tongues you can shout you can praise God
[53:16] well that's Apostolic
[53:20] can you say amen that's Apostolic amen I
[53:24] uh people that don't believe in speaking
[53:25] in tongues I you know let's just put it
[53:28] let's just put it plain hey man you you
[53:31] can't tell me where brother random took
[53:32] it out of out of the church and he's the
[53:34] one that said I preach what Paul
[53:36] preached
[53:37] can you say amen that's exactly right he
[53:40] didn't take tongues out of the church he
[53:43] didn't take tongues out of the body he
[53:45] put order to it but he didn't take it
[53:47] out
[53:48] but we can look and say that that's
[53:50] Apostolic Doctrine because Paul put
[53:53] order to it as well
[53:55] ain't that right see so then another
[53:58] thing that's Apostolic is is what the
[54:02] Apostle Paul taught in First Corinthians
[54:04] 14 32. amen uh uh that the spirits of
[54:08] the prophets are subject to the prophets
[54:11] do you believe that amen the spirit of
[54:14] the prophets are subject to the prophets
[54:16] so that's Apostolic Doctrine amen for
[54:20] God is not the author of confusion but
[54:24] of Peace as in all churches of the
[54:27] Saints ain't that right so now brother
[54:30] Branham says this see when the pastor
[54:32] sees something wrong and he says look
[54:34] sister or brother that's wrong what
[54:36] you're submissive that's right you're
[54:37] submissive see the spirit of the
[54:40] prophets is subject to the prophet
[54:42] you're submissive you say God forgive me
[54:44] I didn't mean to do get out of out of
[54:46] order see to the church you know he said
[54:49] I'm ready oh to the church and move on
[54:50] and then you're going to see a church
[54:53] moving for the glory of God see the
[54:55] spirit of the Prophet is subject to the
[54:57] prophet everything's in order the church
[55:00] said in order but if you get your head
[55:02] stuck up and say well I don't believe
[55:04] that you know and I just tell you see
[55:07] that shows right then there's something
[55:09] wrong with you see that's wrong there's
[55:11] something wrong you can't stand
[55:13] correction you know what I mean he said
[55:15] see the scripture says Mark those two
[55:18] see uh that's right if you can't stand
[55:20] correction you can't stand in order you
[55:23] can't stand in the things of God then
[55:25] you pull off well then Paul says they
[55:27] went out from us because they wasn't of
[55:30] us ain't that right well church that's
[55:32] Apostolic Doctrine ain't that right so
[55:35] so when we're trying to when when we're
[55:38] trying to make sure to not hurt people's
[55:41] feelings and we're trying to keep
[55:43] friends with with everybody well you
[55:45] you've got to be a chameleon is that
[55:48] what they call that a chameleon where
[55:49] you change colors and wherever wherever
[55:52] you're at you just change colors or but
[55:54] but that's not Apostolic Doctrine the
[55:56] Apostle stood for what they believed
[55:58] ain't that right we had come or go Paul
[56:01] says all of Asia forsook me amen he
[56:04] didn't try to change colors he just
[56:06] stood on that on the principles of God's
[56:08] word amen and so is the church today
[56:12] standing upon the principles of God's
[56:15] word Ephesians 2 18 tells us Paul would
[56:18] tell us through him we both have access
[56:21] by one Spirit unto the father now
[56:24] therefore you are no more strangers and
[56:27] foreigners but fellow citizens with the
[56:30] Saints and of the household of God
[56:32] aren't you glad for that a man that your
[56:35] fellow citizens with with the Saints and
[56:37] household of God you're no more
[56:39] foreigners you're no more strangers and
[56:42] are built upon the foundation of the
[56:45] Apostles and Prophets Jesus Christ
[56:48] himself being the Chief Cornerstone a
[56:52] man so you are built upon the foundation
[56:54] of the Apostles and the prophets ain't
[56:57] that right amen see so we find a lot of
[57:01] things that are in the Pentecostal age
[57:02] amen that are not Apostolic it did not
[57:06] start with the first church a man and uh
[57:09] it's it's just it's just not there but
[57:12] the foundation of the church is
[57:15] Apostolic can you say amen and we go
[57:17] back to one doctor drink one face one
[57:21] baptism one Lord ain't that right and
[57:25] anything else we don't want to be a part
[57:27] of that that's exactly right so then if
[57:31] someone tells you that the apostolic
[57:33] Days Are Over don't you believe that if
[57:36] they're not over can you say amen amen
[57:39] maybe you could say it with me the
[57:40] apostolic days
[57:42] are not over that's right the apostolic
[57:45] days are not over brother Branham says
[57:48] that statement is wrong a man on two
[57:50] accounts when they tell you that the
[57:52] apostolic days are over he says that
[57:54] statement's wrong on two accounts he
[57:56] said number one it is wrong to suppose
[57:59] that there are no more Apostles just
[58:01] because the Twelve Apostles are dead he
[58:04] said the word Apostle means one that is
[58:07] sin and God is still sending men can you
[58:10] say Amen he's still sending men and they
[58:13] are called missionaries
[58:15] ain't that right he says number two the
[58:18] second reason that that statement of the
[58:21] Apostles days of the apostolic days are
[58:23] over he says see they're referring to an
[58:26] age of manifested holy ghost power being
[58:30] over since the Bible has been completed
[58:33] so so we know we don't add we don't take
[58:36] away from this and so people have gotten
[58:38] the idea that because this is completed
[58:40] that we don't need the apostolic days we
[58:43] don't need the Holy Ghost in
[58:44] manifestation anymore and sadly that's
[58:47] becoming in the church and our message
[58:49] ranks as well amen and we're getting
[58:51] more educated morons a man that are
[58:55] trying to get us to sit and educate us
[58:57] and and and and and and no wonder it's
[59:00] becoming more and more popular amen for
[59:03] this psychiatrist and psychology and all
[59:07] this to come into the church we don't
[59:08] need Psychology that was not the
[59:11] apostolic Doctrine we need the
[59:13] manifestation of the Holy Ghost in the
[59:16] church today amen the Holy Ghost can
[59:19] amen he can discern your heart it can
[59:21] tell you where you're wrong it can tell
[59:23] you where to repent it can tell you
[59:25] where you messed up and make it right
[59:26] can you say amen amen he can do things
[59:29] that psychology will never be able to do
[59:31] as the prophet said psychology is just a
[59:35] shot in the dark amen the Holy Spirit
[59:37] doesn't do things as a shot in the dark
[59:39] it can tell you exactly right on where
[59:42] you're at
[59:43] ain't that right amen but see they're
[59:46] telling us well we're in the fullness of
[59:47] the word amen so we don't need all that
[59:50] jumping and carrying on we don't need
[59:51] all that manifestation well what they
[59:54] don't realize is that crying is it can
[59:57] be tears flowing down a person's cheeks
[1:00:00] can be a manifestation of the Holy Ghost
[1:00:01] somebody shouting can be a manifestation
[1:00:04] of the Holy Ghost somebody speaking in
[1:00:06] tongues can be a manifestation of the
[1:00:08] Holy Ghost somebody interpreting can be
[1:00:11] a manifestation of the Holy Ghost can
[1:00:13] you say Amen someone running in a church
[1:00:15] and excited can be the manifestation of
[1:00:18] the Holy Ghost somebody jumping out of
[1:00:20] their Pew lifting up their hand and
[1:00:22] saying amen can be a manifestation of
[1:00:25] the Holy Ghost can you say Amen oh yes
[1:00:28] sir many times brother Brown said people
[1:00:30] raising their hand Defying Gravity amen
[1:00:33] is because the Holy Ghost is upon them
[1:00:35] amen calls on them to raise up their
[1:00:37] hands causing them to shout causing them
[1:00:40] to scream causing them can you say Amen
[1:00:43] you you go back and listen to that
[1:00:46] Garden Simplicity in Albuquerque brother
[1:00:49] Branham showing him how to receive the
[1:00:51] Holy Ghost he tells them lift your hands
[1:00:53] up and begin to praise the Lord and
[1:00:55] before you know it you start hearing
[1:00:57] people scream he said that's it that's
[1:00:59] it that's the holy ghost coming upon you
[1:01:00] can you say Amen oh when I we want to
[1:01:03] put all that out that the manifestation
[1:01:05] of the Holy Ghost in power is genuine
[1:01:08] can you say amen that's exactly right I
[1:01:11] know the rain falls on the just and the
[1:01:13] unjust but if it can fall on the
[1:01:15] unjustic and fall on the just as well
[1:01:17] can you say Amen it can fall on the
[1:01:20] genuine seed and the sin genuine seed
[1:01:23] can be a reality to it
[1:01:26] amen they can receive a real experience
[1:01:28] of the Holy Ghost
[1:01:31] now so brother Brown says see amen uh
[1:01:34] they're referring to an age of
[1:01:36] manifested holy ghost power being over
[1:01:38] since the Bible has been completed
[1:01:41] brother Brown said there is not one even
[1:01:43] one scripture that suggests that but
[1:01:47] many conclusively state otherwise ain't
[1:01:50] that right acts 1 8 is one of them amen
[1:01:53] but you shall receive power everybody
[1:01:55] say power after that the Holy Ghost has
[1:01:58] come upon you and you shall be Witnesses
[1:02:01] unto me both in Jerusalem and in all
[1:02:04] Judea and in Samaria and unto the other
[1:02:07] uttermost parts of the earth ain't that
[1:02:10] right amen then you go to Acts 2 39 for
[1:02:13] the promise Peter says for the promise
[1:02:15] is unto you Jews the prophet said and to
[1:02:19] your children Jews and to all that are
[1:02:22] far off Gentiles even as many as the
[1:02:26] Lord Our God shall call Jew and Gentile
[1:02:29] ain't that right amen seeds so the
[1:02:32] prophet never done away with these
[1:02:33] scriptures he tells us that the promise
[1:02:36] is still for us today but people want to
[1:02:39] look at the Pentecostal lady and say
[1:02:40] well brother Brown said they're just
[1:02:42] blowing smoke out of the out of the
[1:02:44] stack so that's not for us today well
[1:02:46] I'll tell you what Amen on the day of
[1:02:48] Pentecost they didn't blow smoke out of
[1:02:50] that stack they knew exactly what to do
[1:02:52] with that power Devils were cast out
[1:02:56] people were delivered ain't that right
[1:02:58] amen they knew what it was to walk in
[1:03:01] the right Doctrine they knew what it was
[1:03:02] Amen to walk in power and demonstration
[1:03:06] of the Holy Ghost
[1:03:09] amen so the promise is to as many as the
[1:03:13] Lord Our God shall call Brother Graham
[1:03:15] said until he stops calling the
[1:03:18] Pentecostal message and power will not
[1:03:21] cease
[1:03:23] can you say Amen
[1:03:24] now you say well I believe he's he's he
[1:03:26] stopped calling then I dare you to tell
[1:03:29] me when he did it
[1:03:33] if we want to go there go go listen to
[1:03:35] souls in prison
[1:03:36] and he's questioning then if if it
[1:03:39] stopped if it was over
[1:03:42] and he says if it is over what about my
[1:03:44] children
[1:03:45] can you say Amen
[1:03:47] so if we want to go there and say well
[1:03:48] the Lord stop calling well
[1:03:52] brother Brandon was if he only ever
[1:03:54] asking the questions even then so we can
[1:03:57] stop it there and if that be the case if
[1:03:59] you weren't born before that year you
[1:04:02] ain't got no chance yourself
[1:04:06] I mean we can go in in all kinds of
[1:04:08] arguments you understand what I'm saying
[1:04:10] amen but I believe the Lord is still
[1:04:12] calling
[1:04:13] I believe he's still doing a work in
[1:04:16] this age
[1:04:17] can you say man we may not be seeing a
[1:04:20] lot of them things in this age amen
[1:04:22] because we know that time is is wrapping
[1:04:25] up that we should never ever stop having
[1:04:28] a burden for Souls
[1:04:30] we should never ever stop amen trying to
[1:04:33] get somebody amen into the kingdom of
[1:04:36] God
[1:04:37] I believe it was even brother Brown and
[1:04:39] say that Abraham went to the end of the
[1:04:41] road after the Lost
[1:04:43] ain't that right and said we'll do the
[1:04:45] same so so I hope you understand amen
[1:04:49] that that that as long as as as until he
[1:04:53] stops calling the Pentecostal message
[1:04:56] and power will not cease now notice what
[1:05:00] brother Brown says what the church had
[1:05:02] at Pentecost is her inalienable right
[1:05:07] it's your right
[1:05:10] ain't that right
[1:05:11] see originally she had the pure word of
[1:05:14] God she had the power of the spirit
[1:05:16] manifested in diverse signs and wonders
[1:05:20] and Gifts of the Holy Ghost
[1:05:23] ain't that right so what happened to the
[1:05:26] people on the day of Pentecost amen uh
[1:05:30] they received power that's what Jesus
[1:05:32] had promised them you shall receive
[1:05:34] power well they receive power and Peter
[1:05:38] identified it as being the Fulfillment
[1:05:40] of Joel's prophecy there Acts 2 17 and
[1:05:44] it shall come to pass in the last day
[1:05:47] saith God I will pour out of my spirit
[1:05:49] upon All Flesh and your sons and your
[1:05:52] daughters shall prophesy and your young
[1:05:56] men shall see Visions in your old men
[1:05:59] shall dream dreams and all my servants
[1:06:01] and on my handmaids I will pour out uh
[1:06:04] in those days of my spirit and they
[1:06:08] shall prophesy now we were talking about
[1:06:11] that last Sunday of how it was word
[1:06:14] bread that fell it was the Manna word
[1:06:17] bread that that fell on the day of
[1:06:20] Pentecost Manna manifested word ain't
[1:06:23] that right that's what real man is to us
[1:06:26] is manifested word Jesus said I am the
[1:06:29] bread that came down from heaven amen so
[1:06:32] Peter was identifying this not as a
[1:06:36] sensation not as just some work up we're
[1:06:39] not following like uh like the people
[1:06:41] follow David koresh and Jim Jones and
[1:06:44] whatever amen we're not excitable people
[1:06:47] in that way we're not so
[1:06:51] um uh vulnerable that we just follow
[1:06:53] everything but he began to tell them
[1:06:55] this is scripture
[1:06:58] can you say man he was basing it all on
[1:07:02] scripture ain't that right amen and the
[1:07:05] Bible says they began to speak with
[1:07:07] other tongues
[1:07:11] ain't that right
[1:07:13] and notice brother Brown said they tried
[1:07:15] to talk and couldn't talk anymore in any
[1:07:18] more human languages they were so
[1:07:21] quickened up in the presence of God till
[1:07:24] they spoke in new tongue a Heavenly
[1:07:27] language
[1:07:28] ain't that right it quickened their body
[1:07:32] to speak in a language they never heard
[1:07:34] of before it quickened their body they
[1:07:38] spoke in new Heavenly language well what
[1:07:42] what what what happened they received
[1:07:45] their abstract
[1:07:48] a man indeed from God and the prophet
[1:07:51] said it glorified their souls
[1:07:57] they just didn't receive something was
[1:07:59] silly they received an abstract
[1:08:04] Hallelujah
[1:08:05] the same abstract that you receive
[1:08:08] when you received the Holy Ghost
[1:08:12] ain't that right
[1:08:13] and brother Brown said they screamed
[1:08:16] and cloven tongues of fire separated
[1:08:19] upon each of them
[1:08:20] it's so quickened their body
[1:08:23] what the power
[1:08:25] that they received so quickened their
[1:08:28] body till they couldn't even speak in an
[1:08:32] Earthly language anymore
[1:08:34] it quickened their body to a Heavenly
[1:08:37] language the place that they're going to
[1:08:40] ain't that right so the quickening power
[1:08:43] of God shook their mortal bodies he said
[1:08:46] tell their entire mortal language was
[1:08:49] transfigured transformed into an
[1:08:53] immortal language
[1:08:55] amen that's right now notice what Paul
[1:08:58] would tell us in Romans 8 and 11 but if
[1:09:01] the spirit of him that raised up Jesus
[1:09:04] from the dead dwell in you he that
[1:09:09] raised up Christ from the dead shall
[1:09:11] also Quicken your mortal Body by his
[1:09:14] spirit that dwelleth in you I tell you
[1:09:17] that's Apostolic Doctrine that's
[1:09:20] Apostolic teaching and that's Apostolic
[1:09:23] Faith Can you shame man if that spirit
[1:09:26] that is it was in Christ dwell in you
[1:09:30] you won't have one foot in the world and
[1:09:32] one foot in the church it just ain't
[1:09:34] gonna happen it'll take your whole being
[1:09:37] it'll Quicken your Immortal body it'll
[1:09:40] Quicken your mind it'll Quicken your
[1:09:42] heart it'll Quicken your spirit amen
[1:09:45] it'll make a Christian a Believer out of
[1:09:48] you
[1:09:51] that's right it's quickening
[1:09:54] and we are quickened then by the power
[1:09:57] of the Living God
[1:09:59] ain't that right notice brother Brown
[1:10:02] said tongues quickened to a new Heavenly
[1:10:06] language to speak them a rapturing up
[1:10:11] raising up into a different atmosphere
[1:10:14] than what they had ever lived in
[1:10:17] he's talking about that 120 now what
[1:10:20] happened that power that they received
[1:10:22] it raptured them it raised them up into
[1:10:26] a an atmosphere they had never been in
[1:10:30] that's what the power of God does
[1:10:33] see and so we find raising up into a
[1:10:37] different atmosphere than what they had
[1:10:39] ever had lived in also with the new
[1:10:42] quickening life to them that come in
[1:10:44] them equipping their language they spoke
[1:10:47] in new tongues
[1:10:50] now the apostolics and the Pentecostals
[1:10:53] today say well uh uh uh when you receive
[1:10:55] the Holy Ghost you've got to speak in
[1:10:57] tongues that's your evidence brother
[1:10:58] Brown plainly tells us that is not an
[1:11:00] Evidence can you say Amen but we can we
[1:11:04] can say it this way a man that you can
[1:11:07] speak in tongues ain't that right no
[1:11:10] matter what the what what what what what
[1:11:12] the power of God does it will stay
[1:11:15] within the apostolic realm of Doctrine
[1:11:18] the original Church
[1:11:25] laughs I might be going to against a lot
[1:11:28] of beliefs here but it's still true
[1:11:34] you've never you can never outgrow
[1:11:36] Pentecost
[1:11:39] you can never outgrow the apostolic
[1:11:41] Doctrine
[1:11:43] hello
[1:11:48] I know
[1:11:49] Satan would love for us to be formal
[1:11:52] he would love for us just to come to
[1:11:54] church
[1:11:57] if he had his way we wouldn't even
[1:11:59] wiggle a toll
[1:12:02] if he had his way you'd never hear an
[1:12:04] amen
[1:12:06] if he had his way our young people would
[1:12:08] never experience the power of God
[1:12:11] if he had his way we'd all be dead and
[1:12:13] dried
[1:12:14] just like any other normal Church
[1:12:17] but it ain't going to happen
[1:12:20] not as long as there's believers
[1:12:24] can you say man
[1:12:27] you know and and they say well you
[1:12:28] working it up no we're not now now
[1:12:30] anyone that's really been in the
[1:12:32] Pentecostal Rim era
[1:12:34] of the Pentecostal age you know what
[1:12:36] they do to work it up
[1:12:38] everybody jumps on the music and they
[1:12:41] Jam
[1:12:42] and and
[1:12:44] you know I I know how it is
[1:12:48] you know pastor's in the mood you know
[1:12:50] preachers in the mood for people to
[1:12:51] dance and Shout he's feeling good so he
[1:12:54] works it up buddy
[1:12:56] gets that music of cranking and you know
[1:12:59] and over and over over and over and over
[1:13:02] and over
[1:13:03] then he goes see hey hey you know God's
[1:13:07] here
[1:13:08] yes come on now you know finally someone
[1:13:10] starts with it that's it that's it
[1:13:12] that's it you know
[1:13:13] before you know what usually on the
[1:13:16] ladies start screaming glory to God
[1:13:19] that's it
[1:13:20] you know and it's a workup it's just
[1:13:23] work up
[1:13:25] but when you see a people that's excited
[1:13:27] about the word
[1:13:30] so many times you know we'd have we'd
[1:13:33] have powerful services and then
[1:13:35] everybody you know is done and you know
[1:13:38] and that may have lasted two hours or
[1:13:40] more
[1:13:41] and then past well the Lord's had his
[1:13:43] way here tonight so we we won't even go
[1:13:46] into preaching we just had a good
[1:13:48] service tonight thank the Lord for
[1:13:50] moving right well see that's not
[1:13:53] Apostolic Doctrine
[1:13:55] that's Apostolic or that's Pentecostal
[1:13:58] age
[1:13:59] that was not part of the apostolic
[1:14:01] Doctrine
[1:14:02] hello
[1:14:04] yes sir so we know that there's
[1:14:06] fanaticism and we're going to get more
[1:14:08] into it as we go there there is
[1:14:10] fanaticism but you know and and and and
[1:14:13] and and this tells me if someone's
[1:14:15] really listening to the message because
[1:14:17] the prophet already told us about the
[1:14:19] fanaticism that he told us there's
[1:14:22] always if you see the if you see the
[1:14:24] bogus there's a genuine
[1:14:27] look for the genuine
[1:14:29] ain't that right how you can tell the
[1:14:32] bogus to study the real
[1:14:36] that's right
[1:14:38] so we we find that after they receive
[1:14:40] the abstract this power was designed the
[1:14:44] prophet said to give them every promise
[1:14:46] that was on the grounds of God's word
[1:14:49] after they received this abstract on the
[1:14:52] day of Pentecost it was it was the
[1:14:55] grounds that that they could receive
[1:14:58] every promise of God that was in God's
[1:15:02] word can you say amen and so the power
[1:15:04] was to Quicken them to all that was
[1:15:07] promised in the word of God they laid
[1:15:10] hands on the sick and the sick was
[1:15:12] healed they spoke in new tongues they'd
[1:15:15] done signs and wonders and they did it
[1:15:17] because that was God's promise
[1:15:20] can you say man they did those things
[1:15:23] because it was a promise of God
[1:15:27] now notice what Paul would tell us in
[1:15:30] Hebrews 2 therefore we ought to give the
[1:15:34] more Earnest heed to the event to the
[1:15:37] things which we have heard lest at any
[1:15:40] time we should let them slip
[1:15:43] ain't that right
[1:15:45] for if the word spoken by Angels was
[1:15:48] steadfast in every transgression and
[1:15:50] Disobedience received a just recompense
[1:15:52] of reward how shall we escape if we
[1:15:55] neglect so great salvation
[1:15:58] which at the first began to be spoken by
[1:16:00] the Lord and was confirmed unto us by
[1:16:03] them that heard him God also bearing
[1:16:07] them witness both with signs and wonders
[1:16:09] and with divers Miracles and Gifts of
[1:16:12] the Holy Ghost according to his own will
[1:16:16] ain't that right
[1:16:18] so God cannot change
[1:16:24] you can't tell me the church starts
[1:16:26] off-powerful and then we just sit here
[1:16:28] not knowing having a clue of what the
[1:16:30] Supernatural is
[1:16:31] ah I ain't gonna accept that and when
[1:16:35] then we put all and then we just become
[1:16:37] message folks that we all just tell
[1:16:38] stories of what brother Branham done or
[1:16:40] what God done in brother branham's
[1:16:42] Ministry now don't get me wrong I love
[1:16:43] to hear the them stories and I I love to
[1:16:46] hear it all over again amen and I can
[1:16:48] hear it and hear it and hear it I love
[1:16:49] to hear what God done there but you know
[1:16:51] what that only excites my faith to know
[1:16:54] that he was the Forerunner amen and here
[1:16:57] I am he he prophesied I'm the prophecy
[1:17:00] can you say man he said there would be
[1:17:03] an invincible church I am that
[1:17:05] Invincible Army he said there will be a
[1:17:08] super race I am that super race
[1:17:13] ain't that right
[1:17:15] so so what God done then it just gives
[1:17:18] us encouragement
[1:17:20] because we know it's still here he's the
[1:17:23] god of today
[1:17:25] you believe that if God could work
[1:17:27] through them people being at a the
[1:17:29] beginning of his thoughts of what he
[1:17:32] wanted to go listen to the masterpiece
[1:17:34] brother Brown said God wanted a
[1:17:36] masterpiece and he started to build that
[1:17:38] man's Masterpiece on the day of
[1:17:40] Pentecost it was not the complete
[1:17:43] Masterpiece he just started it
[1:17:46] and look what they've done just in the
[1:17:48] beginning of that masterpiece
[1:17:50] and here we are
[1:17:57] we are the the Masterpiece today
[1:18:00] you believe it
[1:18:02] yes sir
[1:18:03] so now God cannot change
[1:18:06] we're not saying that the church cannot
[1:18:08] change we're not saying that the
[1:18:09] messengers cannot change
[1:18:13] but the church isn't God
[1:18:15] so she can change
[1:18:18] but because the unchanging God has
[1:18:20] unchanging ways the prophet said we can
[1:18:23] go back to the beginning and see the
[1:18:26] first and perfect ACT of God and then
[1:18:29] judged by that standard that is how it
[1:18:32] is done
[1:18:38] hello
[1:18:40] it's the Holy Ghost Inside you that
[1:18:42] you're claiming to have doesn't Quicken
[1:18:43] you
[1:18:46] you're judging it by the wrong standard
[1:18:50] there's a standard to this
[1:18:53] it will Quicken you
[1:18:58] hello
[1:19:00] I you know I know we're living an evil
[1:19:04] age
[1:19:05] most deceptive age most horrible age
[1:19:10] I feel sorry for you young people I've
[1:19:12] well just I guess everyone
[1:19:15] that ain't got the Holy Ghost
[1:19:18] and even if you got the Holy Ghost I
[1:19:20] know the Temptations are there
[1:19:23] never before has has pornography if
[1:19:27] they've been so available
[1:19:29] to human beings
[1:19:31] as it is today
[1:19:34] so much corruption has been so available
[1:19:37] to us today by phones internet
[1:19:41] etc etc
[1:19:43] so I understand that I understand you
[1:19:46] know you got your comedies on YouTubes
[1:19:49] and you got your now you got you can
[1:19:51] play video games on your phone and and
[1:19:53] you can you can just do all kinds of
[1:19:55] stuff
[1:19:57] so much stuff that people forgetting God
[1:20:01] voices are drowning out the voice of God
[1:20:06] that all I know to tell you this there
[1:20:08] is a bride that's going to make it in
[1:20:09] this rapture
[1:20:12] there's going to be somebody going to
[1:20:14] make it
[1:20:14] and and the only way they're going to
[1:20:16] make it is to quickening power
[1:20:20] I believe that the Holy Ghost is strong
[1:20:22] enough to Quicken our bodies
[1:20:24] to Quicken our minds
[1:20:27] to Quicken to where we turn our heads
[1:20:28] when we're supposed to turn our heads
[1:20:32] hello
[1:20:34] to walk away from the field when we're
[1:20:36] supposed to walk away
[1:20:40] I just believe that quickening power is
[1:20:43] still here
[1:20:44] because that is the standard
[1:20:47] I I just don't believe that we're going
[1:20:49] to make it and say well God I you know
[1:20:51] I'm so glad you you I'm just lucky to be
[1:20:53] part of your bride even though I
[1:20:55] couldn't I couldn't over time that ain't
[1:20:57] the way it's going to be there's going
[1:20:58] to be Overcomers make this thing
[1:21:01] and it steals the set standard if it can
[1:21:04] Quicken oh Peter that was a coward and
[1:21:06] denied the Lord Jesus three times and
[1:21:09] Quicken into where he could stand there
[1:21:10] and give his own life for this gospel so
[1:21:13] will it Quicken us
[1:21:16] I just believe that
[1:21:19] now brother Brown said the true church
[1:21:20] will always try to be like the original
[1:21:23] at Pentecost the true church of today
[1:21:25] will try to approximate that early first
[1:21:28] one and The Messengers to the churches
[1:21:31] having the same spirit of God in them
[1:21:33] will try to approximate the Apostle Paul
[1:21:35] they won't be exactly like him but the
[1:21:38] true Messengers will be the ones that
[1:21:40] come the closest to Paul who was free of
[1:21:42] all men sold out to God and gave forth
[1:21:45] the word of God only and manifested the
[1:21:47] Holy Ghost in power none else would do
[1:21:50] see none else you have to work from the
[1:21:52] original as like begets like the true
[1:21:55] church will always be the one that tries
[1:21:58] to follow in the steps of her Founders
[1:22:00] at Pentecost and her Messengers will
[1:22:02] follow the Apostle Paul the first
[1:22:04] Messenger to the first church age it is
[1:22:07] that simple and that wonderful can you
[1:22:10] say Amen so then we find if the Bible a
[1:22:13] man didn't teach the baptism of the Holy
[1:22:15] Ghost if the Bible didn't teach the
[1:22:18] baptism of the Holy Ghost and that it
[1:22:21] ceased way back Yonder then I teach the
[1:22:23] same amen but the Bible doesn't teach
[1:22:26] that the Bible says he's Jesus Christ
[1:22:28] the same yesterday today and forever if
[1:22:31] the Bible said that the days of Miracles
[1:22:33] cease with the apostles then I would
[1:22:35] believe that but God said these signs
[1:22:38] shall follow them that belief can you
[1:22:39] say man amen and I believe that amen if
[1:22:43] the Bible said only that only people
[1:22:45] back in the first church a man could
[1:22:48] speak in tongues and and and and that
[1:22:51] was the only age they could do it in
[1:22:52] then then we would believe that but
[1:22:54] Jesus said these signs shall follow the
[1:22:57] believer and speaking in tongues was
[1:22:59] part of that
[1:23:01] can you say man that's right if the
[1:23:04] Bible taught what a lot of these
[1:23:06] preachers are teaching a man today then
[1:23:09] we would believe that and what they were
[1:23:11] saying but but it doesn't see and and
[1:23:13] even brother Branham came against that
[1:23:15] unbelieving spirit amen when he was here
[1:23:18] listen to what brother Brown said how
[1:23:20] can you people say that the apostolic
[1:23:23] age has ceased where do you get it amen
[1:23:26] how can a Vine come out and bear an
[1:23:28] orange today and then this day bear a
[1:23:31] pumpkin it would have to change its life
[1:23:34] can you say Amen well then we find amen
[1:23:37] that the same life that life that was in
[1:23:40] the seed in the time of planting is
[1:23:43] still in the seed in the time of harvest
[1:23:48] it doesn't change life
[1:23:53] it's the life fully develops
[1:23:58] ain't that right
[1:24:01] brother Brandon speaking to the
[1:24:02] Pentecostal said you may be Pentecostal
[1:24:04] but you're uh he said but but by name
[1:24:10] he said you may be Pentecostal but
[1:24:12] you're not and say by name but you've
[1:24:14] got to be Pentecostal the Pentecostal
[1:24:17] under conditions
[1:24:18] that the Life of Christ everybody say
[1:24:20] the Life of Christ
[1:24:22] the word of God can flow through you and
[1:24:25] manifest itself and prove it's got to be
[1:24:28] uh it's to be God see and God working
[1:24:31] through you the Life of Christ in you
[1:24:33] ain't that right so let's say that again
[1:24:35] amen you've got to be Pentecostal under
[1:24:39] conditions
[1:24:40] you're not Pentecostal if you don't meet
[1:24:43] these conditions you'll only be
[1:24:45] Pentecostal by name
[1:24:47] well we don't want to be Pentecostal by
[1:24:49] name we want to be Pentecost by
[1:24:50] experience and this is the Pentecostal
[1:24:53] under condition that the Life of Christ
[1:24:55] the word of God can flow through you and
[1:24:59] manifest itself and prove it's to be God
[1:25:02] and God working through you that's the
[1:25:05] life of Christ in you that's the
[1:25:08] original Pentecost
[1:25:11] is that right
[1:25:14] that's right
[1:25:15] aren't you glad that Peter knew what the
[1:25:17] Bible says about it
[1:25:20] that when the scoffers were there and
[1:25:22] they were saying oh they were accusing
[1:25:23] them of being drunk
[1:25:25] and yet he knew the scriptures enough to
[1:25:28] say these men ain't drunk but this is
[1:25:30] that which the prophet Joel saith
[1:25:32] and we've been accused of a lot of
[1:25:34] things
[1:25:36] I tell you what this Bride is a word
[1:25:38] bride
[1:25:40] she knows what is expected of her in
[1:25:42] this day
[1:25:44] and we can look at him and say but this
[1:25:46] is not fanaticism as you suppose this is
[1:25:48] not just a sensational workup as you
[1:25:51] suppose but this is that
[1:25:54] but God has promised in this day
[1:25:57] ain't that right
[1:25:59] so the prophet said the church is a
[1:26:01] Pentecostal Church
[1:26:03] the life that's in the vine come back
[1:26:05] come up into one church and get a
[1:26:08] Pentecostal experience
[1:26:11] and behind it they have all kinds
[1:26:16] they have all kinds of the gifts of the
[1:26:19] Holy Ghost these signs of the the signs
[1:26:21] of Jesus Christ and today we have
[1:26:24] drafted into it every different kind of
[1:26:26] a denomination Methodist Baptist
[1:26:29] Presbyterian and even Pentecostal
[1:26:31] so-called grafted into it but they don't
[1:26:34] bear the original Fruit they don't have
[1:26:37] the original experience yet they are
[1:26:39] sucking or suckling off of the name of
[1:26:42] Christianity Hallelujah that's right
[1:26:45] that vine ever brings forth another
[1:26:48] Branch it'll be a Pentecostal Branch
[1:26:51] with signs following the believer right
[1:26:54] back to the original these hybrid things
[1:26:56] won't work
[1:26:58] and you say man these hybrid things
[1:27:01] won't work see uh uh he says uh uh uh I
[1:27:07] know they're sticking in there called
[1:27:08] Christianity but they're not
[1:27:10] Christianity by their fruits you shall
[1:27:12] know them and why can't they they'll
[1:27:15] never go back
[1:27:18] can you say man they'll never go back
[1:27:21] hybrid is will never go back
[1:27:25] they can never be an orange because
[1:27:27] they're hybrid yet they wanted the name
[1:27:29] of Christian but they're hybrid
[1:27:32] can you say man but he says in another
[1:27:35] place we are like the original because
[1:27:38] by Spirit life we are original
[1:27:43] we are like the original
[1:27:46] because by Spirit life we are the
[1:27:51] original
[1:27:52] aren't you glad for that
[1:27:56] that's why you don't have to teach
[1:28:00] someone wants to know what it was like
[1:28:02] on Pentecost
[1:28:03] look at the church today
[1:28:07] hello
[1:28:08] look at the church
[1:28:10] today because you're a Pentecostal
[1:28:12] Church
[1:28:18] hello
[1:28:21] so we find here brother Branham says and
[1:28:24] I've got a lot going I'm going to keep
[1:28:25] on going is that all right
[1:28:27] when a man stands and says he's a gospel
[1:28:30] preacher and says that the days of
[1:28:33] Miracles has passed that seed of
[1:28:35] discrepancy
[1:28:36] when a man stands and says that he's a
[1:28:39] minister a pastor of a church somewhere
[1:28:40] and he does not believe that Jesus
[1:28:42] Christ is the same in every detail
[1:28:45] except the physical body the same
[1:28:47] yesterday today and forever that seed of
[1:28:49] discrepancy when he says Miracles and
[1:28:52] Apostolic age passed that seed of
[1:28:55] discrepancy when they say there's no
[1:28:57] such thing as Divine Healing that seed
[1:29:00] of discrepancy and the world is full of
[1:29:03] it and it crowds out and chokes out the
[1:29:06] wheat
[1:29:08] that's either discrepancy is trying to
[1:29:10] choke out the wheat it's trying to choke
[1:29:13] out that Pentecostal experience
[1:29:15] don't you let it do it
[1:29:21] brother Brown says anything that sows
[1:29:23] discrepancy contrary to the written word
[1:29:25] of God or puts any private
[1:29:27] interpretation to it is the seed of
[1:29:29] discrepancy
[1:29:30] can you say man say that again now con
[1:29:33] anything contrary to the written word of
[1:29:36] God or puts any private interpretation
[1:29:40] to it is the seed of discrepancy God
[1:29:44] will not honor it he can't it won't mix
[1:29:48] it certainly will not it's like the
[1:29:51] Mustard Seed see it won't mix with
[1:29:53] anything else you can't hybrid it it's
[1:29:56] got to be the genuine thing
[1:30:01] now to be honest that's what the prophet
[1:30:04] brought us out of is all this
[1:30:05] hybridization
[1:30:07] to where we could be the genuine thing
[1:30:11] then there's nothing wrong with
[1:30:12] identifying what was at Pentecost
[1:30:15] because that was what was genuine
[1:30:21] there's a reason
[1:30:24] as to why Satan hates the Book of
[1:30:26] Revelations
[1:30:28] brother Brown said he knows
[1:30:31] that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday
[1:30:33] today and forever and he changes not
[1:30:36] I'll say that again Satan hates the Book
[1:30:39] of Revelations
[1:30:41] brother Brian said why
[1:30:43] because he knows that Jesus Christ is
[1:30:45] the same yesterday today and forever and
[1:30:47] he changes not Satan knows that
[1:30:52] and yet people of people that are having
[1:30:56] the name Christianity don't even know
[1:30:57] that
[1:30:59] and yet Satan knows that brother Brown
[1:31:02] said he knows that a lot more than than
[1:31:04] do 90 percent of the theologians and
[1:31:08] I'll be honest he knows more he knows
[1:31:10] that more of these so-called unconverted
[1:31:12] uh uh preachers within the message ranks
[1:31:17] and hanging around this message
[1:31:19] brother Brown said he knows that since
[1:31:21] God is immutable in his nature
[1:31:24] then he is just as immutable in his ways
[1:31:28] thus Satan knows that surely that the
[1:31:31] original church at Pentecost with the
[1:31:33] power of God Mark 16 in action is the
[1:31:36] true church that Jesus claims as his own
[1:31:40] all else is false
[1:31:44] can you say man now he's telling us what
[1:31:48] Satan knows
[1:31:50] what Satan knows
[1:31:52] he knows that God is immutable in his
[1:31:56] nature
[1:31:57] Satan knows that God is immutable in
[1:32:00] immutable in his ways
[1:32:03] Satan knows that whatever God started
[1:32:06] out doing it will forever be
[1:32:09] Satan knows that and he knows assuredly
[1:32:12] that the original church at Pentecost
[1:32:14] with the power of God Mark 16 in action
[1:32:17] he is the true church that Jesus himself
[1:32:20] claims as his own
[1:32:24] all else is false
[1:32:29] Mark 16 is not taught in the Methodist
[1:32:31] Church
[1:32:33] Mark 16 is not taught
[1:32:36] in the Baptist Church Catholic Church
[1:32:38] Pilgrim Holiness Nazarene Luther
[1:32:42] whatever else
[1:32:44] brother Rand says they deny it even
[1:32:46] though they know that it's the truth
[1:32:49] but they are so organized
[1:32:52] to where they can't preach it
[1:32:55] and there's good people in them
[1:32:56] organizations
[1:32:58] brother Brown says I'm not I'm not I'm
[1:33:01] not condemning the people in the
[1:33:03] organization I'm condemning that thing
[1:33:05] that's holding them people and he said
[1:33:07] it's the system that's damning them
[1:33:09] people to hell
[1:33:14] and you say Amen
[1:33:16] the the the the nun don't go to nun race
[1:33:19] whatever to be a nun the woman don't go
[1:33:21] to be a nun to be a bad woman she's
[1:33:23] doing it with all of her heart
[1:33:27] good people
[1:33:30] and you say Amen
[1:33:32] that's why if you're free
[1:33:34] if you come out of them systems
[1:33:37] you got to hold on to your freedom
[1:33:40] as Paul would say Stand Fast therefore
[1:33:42] in the Liberty
[1:33:44] with it where Christ has made us free
[1:33:47] can you say Amen
[1:33:49] so they're so organized to where they
[1:33:52] can't preach these things brother Brown
[1:33:53] said it's an antichrist Spirit that's
[1:33:55] got them organized
[1:33:57] now notice what brother Brown says in
[1:33:59] another place we're getting ripe for
[1:34:01] judgment you can preach the Bible and
[1:34:03] the power of the Holy Ghost and the
[1:34:05] resurrection of Christ and the signs and
[1:34:07] wonders will follow the believer and
[1:34:09] speak the gifts coming back into the
[1:34:11] church the restoration of all things and
[1:34:14] preachers will even laugh at you and say
[1:34:15] you've lost your mind
[1:34:18] brother Brown said they doing that
[1:34:20] because we're and it shows that we're
[1:34:21] right for judgment
[1:34:23] can you say Amen that's right see and so
[1:34:27] that same devil is doing his best to
[1:34:29] take it out of our churches they want to
[1:34:32] take the power out they want to take the
[1:34:34] shouting out they want to take the
[1:34:36] dancing out they want to take the joy
[1:34:38] out
[1:34:39] they want to take the power the
[1:34:41] quickening power out you know what they
[1:34:43] want to take out they want to take out
[1:34:45] the Dynamics of this thing
[1:34:49] and you say Amen but I'm telling you
[1:34:51] right now we're not organized this this
[1:34:53] little body is not is not organized and
[1:34:56] will never be organized that's right and
[1:34:59] I'm going to preach the truth about it
[1:35:01] and declare to you that it's still part
[1:35:03] of the church today
[1:35:05] can you say man brother Brown said the
[1:35:07] Church of the Living God is Freeborn of
[1:35:10] the spirit of God don't need any
[1:35:11] denomination they follow the king of the
[1:35:14] Masonic Messianic Kingdom they don't
[1:35:17] have to take the people's things they're
[1:35:19] Freeborn made free by the son who makes
[1:35:23] them free indeed these signs shall
[1:35:26] follow them
[1:35:28] can you say amen and I'm so glad I'm not
[1:35:30] the only preacher preaching these things
[1:35:32] amen we believe that a true message
[1:35:34] believer believes it and a true message
[1:35:36] believer can say Amen to these things
[1:35:39] because that's what the prophet taught
[1:35:42] we're free
[1:35:45] we're free we're free from hybrids
[1:35:49] this gospel shall be preached
[1:35:53] and you say Amen
[1:35:55] now notice
[1:35:58] God planted that seed
[1:36:01] on the day of Pentecost and as we've
[1:36:04] read brother Branham called it the
[1:36:05] original seed or the Pentecostal seat it
[1:36:08] was a Pentecostal seed
[1:36:10] it was the seed word
[1:36:13] he said the word manifested the promise
[1:36:17] that had been given
[1:36:18] so now we know what kind of seed it was
[1:36:20] it was not a hybrid seed it was a seed
[1:36:22] word
[1:36:23] because it could be taken all in the
[1:36:25] Bible
[1:36:27] every bit of what they've done every bit
[1:36:29] of it all their actions all through it
[1:36:31] it was Bible
[1:36:32] right
[1:36:34] but like any seed
[1:36:37] the seed had to die
[1:36:40] it had to rot
[1:36:43] right
[1:36:45] Jesus said in John 12 24 except a corn
[1:36:48] of wheat fall into the ground and die is
[1:36:51] abideth alone but if it die it bringeth
[1:36:53] forth much fruit
[1:36:55] so the prophet said any seed that abides
[1:36:57] alone never does anything
[1:36:59] it's got to fall into the ground to
[1:37:01] bring forth its production again
[1:37:04] ain't that right
[1:37:06] another place he said the seed that goes
[1:37:08] into the Earth it has to die every bit
[1:37:11] of the seed it has to die it has to rot
[1:37:14] every bit of the seed and every bit of
[1:37:16] the life that was in the seed has to
[1:37:18] come forth again
[1:37:20] not some part of the life every bit of
[1:37:23] the life that was in the seed ain't that
[1:37:25] right so it cannot be if it's going to
[1:37:28] come up again it cannot be a defective
[1:37:31] seed and I want you to listen now you
[1:37:33] cannot be a defective seed brother Brown
[1:37:36] said wheat is the bread of life it's not
[1:37:39] if if it's not a hybrid grain bury them
[1:37:43] and and it'll come out again I'll say
[1:37:47] that again wheat is the bread of life
[1:37:49] if it's not a hybrid grain bury it and
[1:37:54] it'll come up again it must be a good
[1:37:58] ripe grain
[1:38:00] defective grains won't rise you don't
[1:38:03] put defective grains into the soil to
[1:38:08] expect a crop out of it because the
[1:38:11] beetle or bacteria what is in the grain
[1:38:14] eats it up it eats the life out of it
[1:38:17] first
[1:38:18] ain't that right that brother Brahm is
[1:38:21] telling us that what God planted on the
[1:38:22] day of Pentecost was not a defective
[1:38:25] brain
[1:38:26] so the devil could not eat the life out
[1:38:28] of it first
[1:38:31] what we're looking at is the seed had to
[1:38:34] die and rot
[1:38:37] they had to be buried
[1:38:39] ain't that right
[1:38:40] so he said see this grain listen this
[1:38:43] grain must be a good grain everybody say
[1:38:45] it must be a good grain
[1:38:48] notice what he says next it must be free
[1:38:50] from fault
[1:38:52] failures
[1:38:54] and so forth in it
[1:38:57] so if we're looking back on the day of
[1:38:59] Pentecost and finding fault with it
[1:39:02] there's something wrong with you
[1:39:04] not God
[1:39:06] because whatever God does it's a perfect
[1:39:09] and whatever they did was perfect
[1:39:11] it was a perfect seed that was there
[1:39:15] ain't that right
[1:39:17] see it must be a thoroughbred green it
[1:39:21] can't be hybrid grain because when it
[1:39:23] comes up you plant it again and your
[1:39:26] wheat is done because a hybrid grain
[1:39:28] Won't Grow Again
[1:39:30] so if this if in other words if this
[1:39:33] seed died and was hybrid on the day of
[1:39:36] Pentecost and when it died then God
[1:39:39] would have had to plant another seed but
[1:39:40] he didn't plant another seed
[1:39:44] we're still part of that seed
[1:39:48] so he said see it can't grow again you
[1:39:51] take the life out of it
[1:39:53] when you hybrid it
[1:39:56] well God ain't going to take the life
[1:39:57] out of it
[1:39:59] by high breeding it can you say Amen
[1:40:02] so another place brother Brown said God
[1:40:04] had showed by that first church that he
[1:40:07] was God
[1:40:09] he had a church perfected
[1:40:14] amen
[1:40:15] he showed by that first church that he
[1:40:18] was God can he not do it again today
[1:40:20] that's exactly what he's doing today
[1:40:22] don't be mowing your troubles don't be
[1:40:25] moaning what you're going through God
[1:40:26] wants to show that he's God through you
[1:40:28] he wants to take your challenges he
[1:40:30] wants to take your mouth and he wants to
[1:40:32] take your struggles and show that he's
[1:40:35] God if he'd done it back then he can do
[1:40:37] it today
[1:40:43] and he had a church perfected
[1:40:46] so there was no fault in the seat
[1:40:50] ain't that right it was not a defective
[1:40:52] seed they were in Oneness the prophet
[1:40:56] said he says this before the Holy Ghost
[1:40:59] came the disciples had no Unity with the
[1:41:02] father they could not understand Jesus
[1:41:04] for God was not in them yet but on the
[1:41:07] day of Pentecost God made them one again
[1:41:14] amen
[1:41:15] acts 4 32 and the multitude of them that
[1:41:19] believed were of one heart
[1:41:22] and of one soul
[1:41:25] say that again the multitude of them
[1:41:27] that believed were of one heart and of
[1:41:30] one's soul
[1:41:31] ain't that right brother Brown said why
[1:41:33] they had been restored back to the
[1:41:36] original again
[1:41:37] the only thing that they had left to be
[1:41:40] disposed of was an old city or they
[1:41:43] lived in here an old body called a city
[1:41:46] or a temple that they lived in here they
[1:41:49] that had to rot because it has to die
[1:41:52] and corrupt but in spirit and in life
[1:41:55] and in purpose and in vision and
[1:41:58] everything they were one with God
[1:42:03] is that right
[1:42:05] brother Brown says another place now he
[1:42:07] says as the first Adam was given a bride
[1:42:10] fresh from the hand of God and was
[1:42:13] undefiled for a brief span
[1:42:17] so was Christ the last Adam given a pure
[1:42:20] bride and fresh at Pentecost
[1:42:23] and she remained separate and undefiled
[1:42:27] for some time
[1:42:32] now if you go to Acts we've read this
[1:42:36] Acts 2 47 or quoted it but it says and
[1:42:40] the Lord added to the church daily such
[1:42:42] as should be saved she remained
[1:42:44] undefiled
[1:42:45] God added to the church
[1:42:48] God at it right
[1:42:50] such as should be saved acts 5 13 and
[1:42:53] the re and of the rest there's no man
[1:42:56] join himself to them
[1:42:58] why she remained undefiled
[1:43:00] no man joined themselves himself to them
[1:43:03] it was God that would add to the church
[1:43:06] it was a man program it wasn't man this
[1:43:09] it wasn't man that it was a man just
[1:43:11] coming up and deciding whatever
[1:43:13] God added to the church and no other man
[1:43:16] nurse joined himself to them can you say
[1:43:19] amen and they remained undefiled but as
[1:43:22] Eve was tempted and seduced by Satan so
[1:43:25] the church was contaminated by the
[1:43:28] entrance of an antichrist spirit
[1:43:31] now I'm not going to keep you much
[1:43:34] longer but I am going to finish
[1:43:36] but first John 4 3 it says break it in
[1:43:39] and this is that Spirit of antichrist
[1:43:42] now notice John being a disciple of the
[1:43:46] Lord being up there on the day of
[1:43:47] Pentecost and now he himself is writing
[1:43:51] these things and this is that Spirit of
[1:43:53] antichrist whereof you have heard that
[1:43:56] it should come and even now already is
[1:44:00] it in the world
[1:44:03] ain't that right you go to Acts 20 and
[1:44:06] 28 take heed therefore unto yourselves
[1:44:08] and do all the flock over which the Holy
[1:44:12] Ghost hath made you overseers to feed
[1:44:14] the Church of God which he hath
[1:44:16] purchased with his own blood for I know
[1:44:18] this after my departing shall Grievous
[1:44:22] wolves enter in among you not sparing
[1:44:25] the flock also of your own selves shall
[1:44:29] men arise speaking perverse things to
[1:44:32] draw away disciples after them therefore
[1:44:35] watch and remember that by the space of
[1:44:38] three years I cease not to warn everyone
[1:44:42] night and day with tears
[1:44:46] and you say man so the church was
[1:44:49] changing your corner now something's
[1:44:51] happening even in Paul's day in John's
[1:44:54] day look at Jude even uh 33 years after
[1:44:58] the day of Pentecost
[1:45:00] Jude writes this to the church beloved
[1:45:04] when I gave all diligence to uh to write
[1:45:07] unto you of the common salvation it was
[1:45:10] needful for me to write unto you and
[1:45:12] exhort you that you should earnestly
[1:45:14] contend for the faith which was once
[1:45:17] delivered unto the Saints 33 years after
[1:45:20] and he's telling them already to contend
[1:45:24] can you say man for there are certain
[1:45:28] men crept in unawares who were before of
[1:45:31] old ordained to this condemnation
[1:45:35] ungodly men turning the grace of our God
[1:45:38] into lasciviousness and denying the only
[1:45:42] Lord God and our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:45:48] look what Paul writes in second
[1:45:50] Corinthians
[1:45:51] 11 and 26 he tells us that he's already
[1:45:56] in Pearls by false Brethren or among
[1:46:01] false brethren
[1:46:05] that's in second Corinthians 11 26.
[1:46:08] pearls endangered among false brethren
[1:46:13] something's happening in the church just
[1:46:17] shortly a short span after the day of
[1:46:20] Pentecost
[1:46:22] ain't that right
[1:46:23] look what happened in Galatians 2 and 2
[1:46:25] Paul writes of it false Brethren
[1:46:27] unawares brought in who came in
[1:46:30] privately privately to spy out our
[1:46:33] Liberty which we have in Christ Jesus
[1:46:36] that they might bring us into bondage
[1:46:42] so men that were not part of the day of
[1:46:45] Pentecost were not part of that that
[1:46:48] original experience have now come in to
[1:46:51] join them
[1:46:53] without having the experience
[1:46:57] and they want to bring them back into
[1:46:59] bondage
[1:47:02] hello
[1:47:04] now we read where Paul talks about his
[1:47:06] wolves the wolves
[1:47:09] after my departure shall Grievious
[1:47:11] wolves come among you you want brother
[1:47:13] Brown said Paul's wolves have become
[1:47:15] nicolaitan
[1:47:18] so they were already there in in in in
[1:47:20] in
[1:47:21] Paul's time
[1:47:24] working
[1:47:26] do you see it in indeceitful
[1:47:28] come in among you unaware
[1:47:32] right
[1:47:33] so notice what Jesus said concerning his
[1:47:36] bride in the first stage in that first
[1:47:38] church age notice what Jesus says
[1:47:41] Revelations 2 and 4 I have somewhat
[1:47:44] against thee because thou Hast left thy
[1:47:47] First Love
[1:47:49] remember therefore from whence Thou Art
[1:47:52] fallen and repent
[1:47:55] so the church the prophet said was
[1:47:58] already a fallen woman in the first
[1:48:02] stage
[1:48:05] right
[1:48:07] notice he says as Satan had gotten to
[1:48:10] Eve before Adam even now had Satan
[1:48:13] seduced the church the bride of Christ
[1:48:16] before the marriage supper of the Lamb
[1:48:22] so that first church had already turned
[1:48:25] away from following the pure word of God
[1:48:29] in such a a short time
[1:48:33] and brother Branham would ask what
[1:48:35] specific thing was in her mist
[1:48:40] that what cause her to fall
[1:48:43] and brother Brown said it was the Deeds
[1:48:46] of the Nicolaitans
[1:48:49] ain't that right
[1:48:51] so he says the seed that perfect Church
[1:48:57] fell to the ground at nicer Rome when
[1:49:01] she become a denomination
[1:49:05] another place the church died at night
[1:49:07] and I see a Rome when she took dogmas
[1:49:10] and Creeds instead of the original word
[1:49:13] ain't that right
[1:49:15] so the church died at nicaea
[1:49:18] when she took dogmas and Creeds instead
[1:49:22] of the original word that's why it's so
[1:49:26] important to stand guard upon the word
[1:49:28] of God
[1:49:32] so another place he said the Church of
[1:49:34] Pentecost dies through the early
[1:49:36] Catholic Church
[1:49:39] but I want you to notice this
[1:49:42] how of a paradox the seed in the ground
[1:49:45] is it is a paradox
[1:49:48] because when that little seed dies it
[1:49:51] rots
[1:49:52] it rots in such a way to where you could
[1:49:56] not find it you can take actually you
[1:49:58] can take the prophet said you can take a
[1:50:00] handful of dirt
[1:50:03] take it to the the laboratory
[1:50:06] and under all their technology try to
[1:50:10] find it the seed and you can't find it
[1:50:13] it's not fair
[1:50:15] yet the life remains there
[1:50:22] even though the seed dies the life
[1:50:24] remains
[1:50:26] and he said that's the paradox
[1:50:29] ain't that right
[1:50:31] he said let the sun shine let the Sun
[1:50:34] get in its right position and let it
[1:50:36] shine upon that dirt and here comes life
[1:50:41] the seed dies but the life stays
[1:50:45] it rocks
[1:50:47] can you say man
[1:50:49] he said it comes up from somewhere
[1:50:51] that's the paradox
[1:50:54] ain't that right everything he says in
[1:50:56] the seed dies except the life
[1:50:59] the life is unseen It's Supernatural
[1:51:02] ain't that right the natural body is
[1:51:05] completely gone but the Supernatural
[1:51:08] still lives
[1:51:10] and I'll say this wherever the pillar
[1:51:12] fire is there is life
[1:51:17] there's life
[1:51:19] and you say Amen
[1:51:21] John 1 and 4 says in him was life
[1:51:25] speaking of Jesus and the life was the
[1:51:28] light of men
[1:51:30] in him was life
[1:51:32] now brother Branham identified that
[1:51:34] Pillar of Fire as the life
[1:51:36] right there wherever the pillar fire is
[1:51:39] there's life
[1:51:40] can you say man
[1:51:42] and if you notice on the day of
[1:51:43] Pentecost the Bible says cloven tongues
[1:51:46] licks of fire fell upon every one of
[1:51:48] them
[1:51:49] showing that God had given his life to
[1:51:52] them
[1:51:54] ain't that right well then you find that
[1:51:57] that life remains in the in the ages in
[1:51:59] the church ages that life remains
[1:52:03] and I'm going to get to it and then I'll
[1:52:04] let you go but he says you know in in
[1:52:07] Revelations the first chapter John
[1:52:11] mentioned several things that he saw
[1:52:14] in that in the in that first chapter of
[1:52:16] Revelations he saw seven golden
[1:52:19] lampstands I don't know Daniel can you
[1:52:22] pull that up the lamp stands
[1:52:26] I don't know if everybody'd be able to
[1:52:27] see it
[1:52:28] but the King James version says
[1:52:31] candlesticks
[1:52:34] which leads us to think of a candle but
[1:52:37] the prophet said John didn't see a
[1:52:39] candle
[1:52:40] ain't that right
[1:52:41] because how many's got a candle you
[1:52:43] never had a dealt with candle you had a
[1:52:45] candle and you light it and I get get
[1:52:47] one you got one in my office you know
[1:52:49] that are a sweet aroma
[1:52:52] but let it go out to burn and burn and
[1:52:54] burn and burn and the candle's going out
[1:52:56] down down down down finally I have to go
[1:52:57] get me another candle so that that would
[1:53:01] not represent what God is trying to say
[1:53:03] here so brother Brown said that's not
[1:53:05] candles
[1:53:06] lamp stands which is totally different
[1:53:09] ain't that right see a candle will burn
[1:53:12] for a while and then it won't burn
[1:53:14] anymore it's finished it's over but John
[1:53:16] didn't see that he saw seven lamp stems
[1:53:19] and each lamp had a wick that was
[1:53:22] connected to one great Wick that went
[1:53:26] into the bowl of oil
[1:53:28] now I've tried to look it up and and I
[1:53:30] really couldn't find it but uh you'll
[1:53:33] find that that lampstand but so there's
[1:53:35] that lamp stand seven lamp stand and
[1:53:38] then each one has a a wick and it all
[1:53:40] goes down to one great Wick and then
[1:53:42] that great Wick goes into a a bowl of
[1:53:45] oil and that wit pulls up that oil and
[1:53:49] keeps pulling that oil to keep the fire
[1:53:51] burning
[1:53:52] ain't that right that's right see so the
[1:53:56] prophet said see the lamp with the wick
[1:53:58] hanking down this pipe kept burning day
[1:54:01] and night day and night you never had to
[1:54:04] light it
[1:54:05] everybody say you never had a lighted
[1:54:07] it never went out
[1:54:10] that that lamp stand never went out see
[1:54:13] you never had to light it see he said it
[1:54:16] kept they just kept pouring oil in the
[1:54:18] main pipe and these lamb stands that
[1:54:21] come out like this had the lamps setting
[1:54:24] on top of them the wick from the lamp
[1:54:27] run down into here and got its life out
[1:54:30] out of here see so one great uh if you
[1:54:34] can get the idea of it their pictures
[1:54:36] are wrong that way brother Brown's
[1:54:38] describing as there's a wick that comes
[1:54:40] out and it feeds to every one of these
[1:54:42] lamps of these lamp stands and that
[1:54:45] great Wick goes into a bowl of oil ain't
[1:54:48] that right so he said see uh uh the wick
[1:54:51] from the lamp runs down into hearing and
[1:54:54] got its life out of there see out of
[1:54:56] that bowl and and what difference it is
[1:54:59] from a candle how different it's a
[1:55:01] lampstand it's pulling oil ain't that
[1:55:04] right and he says the seven lampstands
[1:55:06] represents the seven Church ages ain't
[1:55:09] that right so we see that there's fire
[1:55:12] in every Church age showing there's life
[1:55:15] in every Church age ain't that right the
[1:55:19] seed may have been gone and it died and
[1:55:22] it rotted but the life remains
[1:55:25] that's right so see and notice the same
[1:55:29] source that kept the fire burning in the
[1:55:31] church first church age keep it up there
[1:55:33] if you can in the first church age I
[1:55:36] also kept the other Church ages burning
[1:55:39] the same source that kept that first
[1:55:43] church age burning kept all them other
[1:55:45] ages burning
[1:55:47] kept all that other fire going ain't
[1:55:50] that right Same Spirit same all same
[1:55:53] life same fire that's right see and so
[1:55:56] now the the priest in the Old Testament
[1:55:59] was required to do it and it was a type
[1:56:01] of this the church ages and and so how
[1:56:05] he had to do it he had to like the first
[1:56:07] lamp first
[1:56:09] so it's not like uh
[1:56:12] you know it's not like he he gets his
[1:56:14] little stick like we'd get a match or a
[1:56:17] one of them modern day lighters alike
[1:56:20] and he didn't go around Enlighten it and
[1:56:23] lighten it like that you know he didn't
[1:56:26] do that
[1:56:28] but the prophet said he would take and
[1:56:29] light that first one then he would take
[1:56:32] take the fire from that first one and
[1:56:35] like the second one
[1:56:37] and then he wouldn't take that the fire
[1:56:40] from the first one and like the third
[1:56:41] one he would take the fire from the
[1:56:44] second one in like the first or the
[1:56:45] third one and then from the third one to
[1:56:48] the fourth one and the fourth one to the
[1:56:50] fifth one and the fifth one to the sixth
[1:56:51] one to the seventh
[1:56:53] can you say man so the fire that Lit the
[1:56:56] first stage lit the second age and the
[1:56:59] fire that Lit the second age lit the
[1:57:01] third age and the fire that Lit the
[1:57:03] third age left the fourth age and the
[1:57:06] fire that that Lit the fourth age lit
[1:57:08] the fifth age can you say Amen not a
[1:57:11] different fire of the same fire
[1:57:13] and the fire that Lit the sixth stage
[1:57:15] lift the seventh age
[1:57:19] and you say man
[1:57:21] see so we we find it's it's the same
[1:57:25] fire what is showing the prophet said
[1:57:27] that it was the same holy ghost in all
[1:57:29] the ages
[1:57:31] thank you
[1:57:32] oh
[1:57:33] life
[1:57:35] life remained
[1:57:37] even though the seed was buried and
[1:57:39] rotted life remained
[1:57:41] but the lamp was lit how did that priest
[1:57:43] get that first lit light
[1:57:45] where do you get the fire to light that
[1:57:47] first stage
[1:57:49] brother Brown said he did it off the
[1:57:51] altar
[1:57:52] there was fire on the altar
[1:57:55] and he and who lit the altar God lit
[1:57:58] that altar
[1:57:59] God let that altar and he would get that
[1:58:03] Holy Fire
[1:58:04] that God himself lit and he would like
[1:58:07] that first stage with the fire that God
[1:58:09] brought down God provided the fire can
[1:58:12] you say man that's right see yes sir and
[1:58:16] notice brother Brown said see the pre
[1:58:18] the priest took took fire from the
[1:58:20] sacred altar which was originally
[1:58:22] lighted by the fire of God he lit first
[1:58:25] of all the lamp that was sitting on top
[1:58:27] of the bowl then he lit the second lamp
[1:58:29] from the flame of the first lamp and the
[1:58:31] third lamp received its fire from the
[1:58:33] second lamp and as did the fourth
[1:58:35] received from the third and so on till
[1:58:37] all seven lamps were burning this Holy
[1:58:40] Fire from the altar being passed from
[1:58:42] lamp to lamp is a wonderful type of the
[1:58:45] holy spirit in the seven Church ages
[1:58:48] can you say man now where did the fire
[1:58:51] come from in that first church age where
[1:58:54] did it come from Brother Brown said the
[1:58:57] fire that fell on Pentecost has lit the
[1:58:59] candle the church through every age
[1:59:02] right on down
[1:59:05] didn't you say amen and God provided the
[1:59:08] fire on that Pentecost day that day of
[1:59:11] Pentecost and that fire still being lit
[1:59:15] do you believe it
[1:59:16] Hallelujah I love him if the musicians
[1:59:20] will come
[1:59:21] the original outpouring of Pentecost
[1:59:24] which outpouring came direct from Jesus
[1:59:27] on the mercy seat is in doing his church
[1:59:29] through all seven ages
[1:59:31] and showing forth perfectly that Jesus
[1:59:34] Christ is the same yesterday today and
[1:59:36] forever the never-changing god in his
[1:59:39] Essence and his ways he says the trouble
[1:59:42] of it is today we tried to paint a fire
[1:59:44] and say you know way back in the days of
[1:59:47] Pentecost they did this now what good
[1:59:50] does it do to show a freedom man that's
[1:59:52] freezing to death a painted fire it
[1:59:55] ain't going to help him one bit nope
[1:59:58] he's got to have the fire himself and if
[2:00:01] there's a power of God that made the
[2:00:03] Pentecostals work for the Lord and do
[2:00:05] the works and signs that they did if
[2:00:08] you'll just not paint that picture paint
[2:00:10] the picture but bring the picture in
[2:00:12] reality to them they'll get the same
[2:00:15] experience the same salvation and seal
[2:00:18] their own testimony the way they did but
[2:00:20] you got to get it to them can you say
[2:00:22] Amen you gotta bring the fire to them
[2:00:26] in other words you've got to be lit
[2:00:27] yourself
[2:00:31] you got to get it to them you got you
[2:00:34] you got to not place it back there in
[2:00:36] some other generation but bring it up
[2:00:38] here into this day and age can you say
[2:00:41] man I want to just tell you about what
[2:00:44] God done I'm not satisfied with what God
[2:00:46] does I want to tell you what he's doing
[2:00:47] right now and I believe he's doing a
[2:00:49] whole lot
[2:00:52] and there's a lot that can tell you
[2:00:53] about it sister you Jane you can tell
[2:00:56] what God's doing in your life how he's
[2:00:58] healed your body and he's touched your
[2:01:00] soul Hallelujah brother Matthew you can
[2:01:03] tell that God's calling still in this
[2:01:04] age look what he's done for you
[2:01:10] is he done it or is he not
[2:01:13] do y'all have a testimony
[2:01:17] brother brother Tim you know what God's
[2:01:19] done for you sister Martha you know what
[2:01:21] God's done for you
[2:01:22] he's done a lot brother Mark you know
[2:01:25] what God's doing for you
[2:01:26] Hallelujah you young people know you
[2:01:29] know what God's doing for you
[2:01:31] hallelujah it's something we're not just
[2:01:33] talking about it's something that is a
[2:01:36] reality to us
[2:01:38] we know
[2:01:39] we know can you say man
[2:01:42] yes sir so brother Brown said I believe
[2:01:45] that that same God that fell on the day
[2:01:46] of Pentecost upon his church as a pillar
[2:01:49] of fire and divided himself with cloven
[2:01:51] tongues among his people is here tonight
[2:01:53] it's the same God he was then he is
[2:01:57] today with the same Holy Ghost he said I
[2:02:00] know it's a paradox is it a paradox yes
[2:02:04] sir it is because even though the seed
[2:02:06] died and rotted
[2:02:08] the life remained
[2:02:10] and here we are in Harvest Time back to
[2:02:12] seed again
[2:02:13] that's a paradox
[2:02:15] amen he said I know it's a paradox it
[2:02:18] cannot be explained emotions screaming
[2:02:20] trying and so forth cannot be explained
[2:02:22] but it's a paradox how God does it it's
[2:02:26] the Unseen God dwelling in the human
[2:02:28] heart making himself visible by
[2:02:31] vindicating his word that he is the same
[2:02:33] yesterday today and forever
[2:02:36] and did you know what brother Bram
[2:02:37] called that fire
[2:02:39] and fell on Pentecost
[2:02:41] Pentecostal fire
[2:02:43] so you know what kind of fire that Lit
[2:02:44] the ages
[2:02:45] it was Pentecostal fire
[2:02:48] and you say man oh do you love him
[2:02:52] it'll be wonderful and you know the
[2:02:54] difference between the two virgins
[2:02:58] the wise and the foolish of today
[2:03:01] was fire
[2:03:03] one didn't keep all in their lamp
[2:03:07] and their fire went out
[2:03:09] but there's a bride that still got that
[2:03:11] Pentecostal fire
[2:03:12] that's burn and enter
[2:03:14] Hallelujah
[2:03:16] and I trust you're one of them
[2:03:19] that's still just that's just still
[2:03:21] preaching it can you say man
[2:03:23] he says go God raise up some preachers
[2:03:25] that'll go to trimming lamps
[2:03:27] I'm telling you what we need today
[2:03:29] is something that'll trim our limb to
[2:03:32] show the true Pentecostal fire
[2:03:35] it'll be fire he says in another place
[2:03:38] that will take the church up into Glory
[2:03:40] the Pentecostal fire will ratchet it up
[2:03:45] oh aren't you glad for that
[2:03:47] Hallelujah the fire
[2:03:49] and we know where the fire was
[2:03:51] throughout the Mages
[2:03:55] and they were with the messengers of the
[2:03:56] age
[2:03:58] because Paul or John called him them
[2:04:01] seven Messengers he called them Stars
[2:04:05] fire
[2:04:07] lighting up the night
[2:04:09] can you say man
[2:04:11] and Pentecostal fire was within men
[2:04:14] right there to every age lighting the
[2:04:16] age
[2:04:17] lighting the age
[2:04:19] oh my I love the Lord
