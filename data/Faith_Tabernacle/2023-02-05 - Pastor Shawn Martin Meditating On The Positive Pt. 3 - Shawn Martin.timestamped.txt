[46:51] Humanity amen and know that we love the

[47:02] together and
[47:04] such a great anticipation for that amen
[47:08] if uh we just want to just bow our heads
[47:12] to our Lord before we go into the word
[47:15] and just asking to help us tonight
[47:18] Lord Jesus
[47:21] we're thankful to be part of your
[47:24] children
[47:26] and Lord we've come through many
[47:30] many things in our lives Lord each one
[47:34] of us have a past and
[47:37] we look back over and wonder how we got
[47:39] here
[47:41] the Lord has been by your grace and your
[47:44] mercy
[47:45] Lord we just want to reverence you into
[47:51] just give you honor
[47:54] and Lord I pray that you would just be
[47:57] with us this evening and speak to every
[47:59] Heart Lord
[48:01] just speak through my lips Lord
[48:05] and I pray father that when we leave
[48:07] this place we'd be bitter
[48:10] Christians Lord more equipped to face
[48:14] the enemy Lord
[48:16] father I ask you just a special prayer
[48:19] for sister retief Lord
[48:23] in the church there
[48:25] I know they're suffering they're all in
[48:27] shock
[48:28] that I pray Lord that you would just
[48:30] Comfort their hearts and be with them
[48:33] fathers our prayer during this time of
[48:36] loss
[48:37] we ask it Lord in Jesus Christ's name
[48:41] amen
[48:43] I'd just gotten word that sister retief
[48:46] you know they were in a array he had the
[48:49] heart attack and uh
[48:53] so she's doing good wasn't hurt sounds
[48:55] like
[48:56] and uh just just in shock he had just
[49:02] got through preaching
[49:04] there and they were apparently on their
[49:06] way home or they were I guess going from
[49:09] church when he had the the heart attack
[49:12] but we know he's with our Lord and so
[49:17] and glad for that amen
[49:20] Hebrews the 11th chapter we read this
[49:23] last Sunday evening and I want to read
[49:26] it again the sixth verse but without
[49:28] faith it is impossible to please him
[49:32] for he that cometh to God must believe
[49:34] that he is and that he is a rewarder of
[49:38] them that diligently seek him
[49:41] amen you can have your seeds
[49:44] and I want to continue on the subject of
[49:46] last Sunday evening
[49:48] and um I believe I've titled that
[49:51] meditating on the positive
[49:54] and so I want to maybe just uh continue
[49:59] along them lines
[50:01] there
[50:02] but I believe that God wants us to be
[50:04] positive
[50:07] and another scripture that we've read
[50:11] and I'm going to read it again
[50:14] uh Philippians 4 and 8 says finally my
[50:17] brethren whatsoever things are true
[50:20] whatsoever things are honest whatsoever
[50:23] things are just whatsoever things are
[50:25] pure whatsoever things are lovely
[50:27] whatsoever things are of good report if
[50:31] there be any virtue if there be any
[50:34] praise and that virtue is strength if
[50:37] there be any strength if there be any
[50:38] praise if then think on these things
[50:42] and so there as a Christian there's a
[50:46] way of life that that that
[50:48] uh we must live and and it's it's not
[50:53] you know uh it's not rules it's it's
[50:57] nothing like that it's it's just it's
[50:59] for our benefit
[51:01] it it is a way to defeat the Devil
[51:04] and so I looked up this word and
[51:09] according to Webster the word positive
[51:12] is to be fully assured
[51:15] to be certain
[51:18] it means that you have come to a
[51:20] conclusion
[51:22] where there is no doubt or uncertainty
[51:27] so that's what positive is
[51:29] so when we're thinking of uh
[51:34] meditating on the positive then we're
[51:37] looking at that that something that that
[51:40] has been settled
[51:43] no questions to it
[51:46] we we've come to a place of absolutely a
[51:50] surety we're certain ain't that right
[51:54] so we're not we're not talking of
[51:56] positive thinking as what the world is
[51:59] because
[52:00] what is there positive that can be so an
[52:05] absolute there's nothing
[52:07] and and so we're not going that
[52:10] direction but there is a positive
[52:12] and there there is something that is an
[52:15] absolute and that's the word of God
[52:17] ain't that right so you can only be
[52:21] positive
[52:22] uh or certain
[52:25] and and uh Webster use this word
[52:32] indubitable
[52:34] so you can only be positive or certain
[52:37] on indubitable
[52:40] evidence you know I wouldn't use that
[52:43] word because I didn't know what it was
[52:45] could barely say it in do indubitable so
[52:49] I looked up that word and that means
[52:52] unquestionable
[52:53] so you can only be positive or certain
[52:58] on unquestionable evidence
[53:02] so the evidence has been provided
[53:05] and it is unquestionable
[53:08] ain't that right it's unquestionable now
[53:12] God's been gracious
[53:14] to give us a picture of the pillar fire
[53:18] that brother Branham talked about he
[53:20] would tell us about it did he not I see
[53:22] a light I see this
[53:24] but that's unquestionable
[53:26] because the camera doesn't take
[53:29] psychology
[53:31] it it it takes the actual fact it has to
[53:35] be there in order for the camera to pick
[53:37] it up
[53:38] ain't that right so then we can be
[53:41] positive so we we so our our thinking
[53:45] God has provided positive
[53:48] uh uh uh unquestionable evidence that
[53:53] would allow you to think positive
[53:56] to be positive ain't that right see your
[54:00] your your future is positive
[54:03] because of the evidence the overwhelming
[54:06] evidence that God has provided and it's
[54:09] unquestionable so therefore our future
[54:12] is bright it's positive
[54:14] ain't that right amen so so then there's
[54:18] no reason to question that's what being
[54:21] positive is you can you you can only be
[54:24] positive when there's no reason to
[54:27] question it that's why I'm positive
[54:29] about the message that's why I'm
[54:31] positive about the prophet being Malachi
[54:33] 4. that that's why I'm positive that the
[54:36] angel of of of Revelations 10 1 has come
[54:40] down I'm positive
[54:42] because I have seen evidence that is
[54:45] unquestionable hey ain't that right
[54:48] there's no reason for me to question so
[54:51] so this is what being positive is now
[54:56] then a person would have to have faith
[54:58] in in order to be positive for faith is
[55:03] is positive ain't that right now we've
[55:06] read without faith it is impossible to
[55:10] please God so so any anything if you're
[55:14] going to please God it has to be through
[55:17] positivity
[55:18] it ain't that right now if God wouldn't
[55:21] have provided enough evidence then then
[55:24] he couldn't expect you to be positive he
[55:27] couldn't expect you to meditate on the
[55:28] positive he couldn't expect you to speak
[55:31] positive but he's already provided the
[55:33] evidence
[55:34] ain't that right so therefore it it if
[55:37] to the believer it would produce a
[55:41] positive attitude a positive confession
[55:44] a positive thinking ain't that right
[55:47] everything about Christianity is
[55:50] positive brother random said there's
[55:52] nothing negative about Christianity
[55:55] nothing because there's overwhelming
[55:58] evidence and the evidence is
[56:00] unquestionable
[56:02] ain't that right so so then without
[56:05] faith it is impossible to please God now
[56:10] now we are human and so we all have to
[56:14] deal with uh our carnal side and and the
[56:18] prophet told us that we are the
[56:21] Battleground amen now there's a war
[56:23] that's been going on in heaven and that
[56:26] that that battle between Satan and God
[56:29] uh uh went from Heaven to Earth for God
[56:33] kicked Satan out of the Earth or Out of
[56:35] Heaven ain't that right and and so it
[56:38] was in the garden that we see that God
[56:40] raised a uh uh created him a family Adam
[56:43] and Eve and and he fellowshipped with
[56:46] him he communed with him but then that
[56:49] Old Slew Foot the devil was lurking
[56:51] around and he was present when God told
[56:54] him told them not to eat of the tree he
[56:57] knew what God said he was lurking around
[56:59] in the garden just kind of wandering
[57:01] around and and when God would visit with
[57:03] them no doubt he was right there
[57:05] listening all that time so then when he
[57:08] got Eve by herself away from Adam and
[57:12] and and it didn't happen just that one
[57:14] time but but I I believe it's actually
[57:17] brother Brown told us it was just bit by
[57:19] bit bit by bit just planting Little
[57:21] Seeds here little thoughts there little
[57:23] things here and he finally and she began
[57:26] to finally listen to him she began to
[57:29] ponder over what he was saying he began
[57:32] to ponder she began to reason it out and
[57:35] finally he got her into a place that he
[57:39] got her alone and began to able to speak
[57:41] to her directly and say did not you know
[57:44] uh uh didn't you know and and well she
[57:47] said well the Lord said that we ain't
[57:49] supposed to eat of this tree right and
[57:51] did you know that the serpent quoted God
[57:54] verbatim
[57:56] ain't that right he quoted verbatim What
[58:00] what what God told Eve but he just
[58:03] Twisted it just a little bit ain't that
[58:06] right so so we find that that uh uh uh
[58:11] so so that we find from there the
[58:14] Battleground is is we are the
[58:17] Battleground and it's in our minds ain't
[58:19] that right God chose the heart Satan
[58:22] chose our intellect chose the Mind amen
[58:25] and so now the the approach that Satan
[58:29] has is always negative everybody say
[58:31] Satan is always negative
[58:33] Satan is always negative and you know
[58:36] what negativity is it's a sign of
[58:39] unbelief
[58:41] negativity is a sign of unbelief and
[58:44] unbelief comes from Satan and and
[58:46] brother Brown said that's the sin is
[58:48] unbelief ain't that right so then as
[58:52] Christians in this age we must know how
[58:57] to discern between what is is the devil
[59:01] and what is God we must be able to
[59:04] discern what is evil and what is is
[59:07] righteous ain't that right yet you have
[59:10] to discern uh uh these things and and
[59:14] now notice uh Malachi 3 16 then they
[59:19] that feared the Lord spake often one to
[59:22] another and the Lord hearkened and heard
[59:25] it and a book of remembrance was written
[59:28] before him for them that feared the Lord
[59:31] and that thought upon his name now his
[59:36] name is called the word of God ain't
[59:38] that right that's what we read in Revel
[59:41] Nations it's called the word of God for
[59:43] he is the word ain't that right now uh
[59:48] he goes on in the 17th verse and they
[59:50] shall be mine the saith the Lord of
[59:54] hosts in that day when I make up my Joel
[59:58] Jewels I will spare them as a man's
[1:00:01] speareth his own son that serveth him
[1:00:04] then shall ye return and discern between
[1:00:08] right the righteous and the wicked
[1:00:11] between him that serveth God and him
[1:00:15] that serveth him not ain't that right so
[1:00:17] we're living in a day of discernment
[1:00:20] that that the discernment must be there
[1:00:23] and it must be clear now we've had that
[1:00:26] discernment that spirit of discernment
[1:00:28] uh uh uh come up here uh in this age and
[1:00:33] to discern rightfully discern this word
[1:00:36] ain't that right to let us know what
[1:00:39] truly is Antichrist what is truly The
[1:00:42] Works of the devil what is truly of the
[1:00:45] devil versus what is truly The Works of
[1:00:48] God what is God how God works and and
[1:00:52] and these things things like that ain't
[1:00:53] that right so so therefore uh by
[1:00:57] listening to The Prophet by believing
[1:00:59] the prophet we we are our senses have
[1:01:03] been sharpened amen should be any ways
[1:01:07] to be able to discern every tactic that
[1:01:10] the devil has uh uh that comes our way
[1:01:14] ain't that right now we are here to
[1:01:16] serve God how many believes that we're
[1:01:19] not here to be on the on the fence post
[1:01:21] we we are here to serve God that that is
[1:01:24] our purpose and and and I think that's
[1:01:26] that's every one of us has got to come
[1:01:28] to this even you young people you've got
[1:01:31] to come to the the fact I am here to
[1:01:33] serve God I am a Christian before
[1:01:35] anything else every decision should be
[1:01:38] based that I am a Christian first ain't
[1:01:40] that right everything I don't care if
[1:01:43] it's the marriage I don't care if it's
[1:01:44] job I don't care where I if it's where I
[1:01:47] live it's it's you know uh there there's
[1:01:49] might have been places that I'd love to
[1:01:51] go I'd love to move to Alaska door
[1:01:53] Montana out you know all these things
[1:01:54] but I'm a Christian first and I'm here
[1:01:57] not to serve Sean Martin I'm here to
[1:01:59] serve God's purpose ain't that Brian
[1:02:01] well that's all of us we are here to
[1:02:04] serve God's purpose and I I I personally
[1:02:06] believe that if if God has brought you
[1:02:09] to this church you're here to serve a
[1:02:10] purpose in the house of God ain't that
[1:02:13] right everything is is for purpose and
[1:02:17] so then as we said to this morning that
[1:02:20] anyone that is truly filled with the
[1:02:23] Holy Ghost is part of the body of Christ
[1:02:26] which means that his own life is flowing
[1:02:31] in you I mean that that is not a
[1:02:34] make-believe that is not just something
[1:02:36] that we're just saying for positive
[1:02:37] thinking that is reality that is the
[1:02:40] truth God's own life flows through your
[1:02:43] veins
[1:02:44] all right ain't that right so you know
[1:02:47] what that means then then the creative
[1:02:49] word is in you right now
[1:02:52] do you believe that his creative power
[1:02:54] is in you right now do you realize that
[1:02:57] omnipotence is in you
[1:03:00] for if God is in you omnipotence uh is
[1:03:03] in you the prophet said deity is not in
[1:03:06] heaven it's in you
[1:03:10] ain't that right you know Jesus was full
[1:03:13] of God he was God all the fullness of
[1:03:15] the God he had what bodily in him but
[1:03:16] you know he had to pray
[1:03:18] for the Bible says All Flesh must cry
[1:03:20] out so he prayed you know what he prayed
[1:03:23] to not the God in heaven he prayed to
[1:03:26] the god in him
[1:03:29] that's what the prophet said he prayed
[1:03:32] to the God that was in him God wasn't
[1:03:34] some far out there way off on some
[1:03:36] Planet God was in him and the god that
[1:03:39] you're praying to is in you
[1:03:43] ain't that right it's it's true it's in
[1:03:46] you and and and and and Paul said it's
[1:03:49] Christ in you remember that's the
[1:03:51] mystery that's been hid before the
[1:03:53] foundation of the world Christ in you
[1:03:55] the hope of glory ain't that right now
[1:03:59] we read this uh this morning but
[1:04:01] omnipotence is a force of unlimited
[1:04:04] power that power is in you the
[1:04:07] omnipotent of God is in you do you
[1:04:10] realize what that is saying the force of
[1:04:13] unlimited power is right in you right
[1:04:16] now
[1:04:17] ah it's bottled up in you
[1:04:20] It's contained in you
[1:04:23] it's Paul Satan and you brush your mind
[1:04:25] right now
[1:04:26] that force of unlimited power
[1:04:29] is in every believer right now
[1:04:32] you're not a victim the omnipotent God
[1:04:35] is in you
[1:04:36] you're you're not limited to
[1:04:39] circumstance that uh that that force of
[1:04:42] unlimited power is in your veins right
[1:04:45] now
[1:04:47] do you believe that so God is the only
[1:04:49] one that is omnipotent but he dwells in
[1:04:53] his church which is his body
[1:04:57] brother Branham said when we have God's
[1:05:00] spirit in us we think like God
[1:05:05] say man we actually take on his nature
[1:05:09] so now as God thinks we think as God
[1:05:11] acts we act as God spoke we speak
[1:05:15] because it's God in us don't tell me
[1:05:18] that God takes your body and then lays
[1:05:19] dormant
[1:05:21] and then all it is is Humanity you're
[1:05:23] just poor beggarly weak and just
[1:05:25] defeated that God didn't God didn't
[1:05:28] redeem you and take your body to live in
[1:05:31] just for that
[1:05:33] ain't that right the Bible the prophet
[1:05:35] said we are his victory he died for this
[1:05:38] purpose
[1:05:40] that we might show his victory
[1:05:43] now Church Calvary means nothing if we
[1:05:47] ain't going to show the world what
[1:05:48] Calvary was
[1:05:50] it was at Calvary that Satan Was
[1:05:52] Defeated it was out Calvary that that
[1:05:55] Satan lost his power it was at Calvary
[1:05:59] that Satan could no longer accuse the
[1:06:02] Believers it was out Calvary because of
[1:06:05] Calvary and today we are proof of that
[1:06:10] you believe it so when we have God's
[1:06:13] spirit in us we think like God now
[1:06:15] Philippians 2 and 5 Paul said lift this
[1:06:18] mind everybody say let this mind be in
[1:06:21] you how can that be in you in us because
[1:06:24] there's something else besides you
[1:06:27] that's living in that body let this mind
[1:06:30] be in you which was also in Christ Jesus
[1:06:34] you realize that Jesus God is a
[1:06:37] personality all to himself he he is
[1:06:41] being all to himself we don't add to God
[1:06:44] we can't take away from God the only
[1:06:47] thing that God does is take your body
[1:06:51] but you didn't add to him and you didn't
[1:06:53] take away from him
[1:06:55] take away from him ain't that right so
[1:06:58] when he comes in he doesn't borrow your
[1:07:00] personality he's his own personality
[1:07:05] ain't that right so then he takes
[1:07:08] control of you and you literally take on
[1:07:11] his mind
[1:07:15] ain't that right see a human being
[1:07:17] cannot think like God
[1:07:21] ain't that right just as a bird cannot
[1:07:23] think like a human being
[1:07:25] or the ladybug
[1:07:27] now brother Branham talks of the canary
[1:07:31] that thought he had knowed all the
[1:07:33] knowledge that needed to be known
[1:07:36] he knowed so much that he could tell all
[1:07:39] the rest of the canaries about the human
[1:07:40] beings so he flies up on his cage and he
[1:07:43] begins to speak about the human being
[1:07:45] and how he knows all about them and all
[1:07:48] of a sudden the professor from Purdue
[1:07:50] walked up and began to speak some high
[1:07:53] polished words to him and the little
[1:07:55] fell about it his eyes and turned his
[1:07:57] head now he had eyes he could see the
[1:08:00] professor he had ears he could hear him
[1:08:03] but of course he didn't know what he was
[1:08:05] talking about why he's got a canary
[1:08:07] brain he's just a bird brain that's all
[1:08:11] he's got he hasn't got a human brain so
[1:08:13] he can't think like human beings
[1:08:17] how in the world could you think like
[1:08:19] God just with your human understanding
[1:08:22] can you say man so this is what's
[1:08:25] happened to the Natural Church they've
[1:08:27] learned all about God in what their
[1:08:29] little peanut human brain can learn
[1:08:34] ain't that right and they sing they know
[1:08:36] all there is because they went to
[1:08:38] Seminary or because they've read books
[1:08:40] or because they can quote quotes or or
[1:08:43] whatever see and they could read the
[1:08:45] Bible backward and forward and quote all
[1:08:47] the scriptures and all that that they
[1:08:48] think they have some knowledge of God
[1:08:50] ain't that right but when God actually
[1:08:53] came and revealed his word promise and
[1:08:57] Vindicated in this age they set their
[1:08:59] dumbfounded
[1:09:02] ain't that right because they're not
[1:09:04] acquainted with his ways they're not
[1:09:06] acquainted with his actions they're not
[1:09:09] acquainted with his supernatural being
[1:09:13] ain't that right now notice see Romans 8
[1:09:17] and 6 I hope that's all right but he he
[1:09:19] says for to be carnally minded is death
[1:09:21] but to be spiritually minded
[1:09:25] everybody say spiritually minded
[1:09:27] think of that spiritually my how did you
[1:09:30] get spiritually minded
[1:09:31] see to be spiritually minded is life and
[1:09:34] peace
[1:09:35] because the carnal mind is enmity
[1:09:38] against God
[1:09:40] ain't that right for it is not subject
[1:09:43] to the law of God neither indeed can be
[1:09:46] so then they that are in the flesh
[1:09:49] cannot please God
[1:09:52] but you are not in the flesh
[1:09:54] [Music]
[1:09:55] see but in the spirit ain't that right
[1:09:59] so something has happened because you
[1:10:02] had a carnal birth you've got a carnal
[1:10:04] nature you've got a carnal everything
[1:10:06] about you is carnal and you should be
[1:10:08] walking after the carnal mind after the
[1:10:11] carnal process or thinking a thought
[1:10:14] process but something must have happened
[1:10:18] ain't that right what was it omnipotent
[1:10:21] God come in
[1:10:23] and he took your vessel he took your
[1:10:26] body he borrows it for his purpose
[1:10:29] remember he died to have preeminence he
[1:10:32] once preeminence he wants first place of
[1:10:34] your life
[1:10:36] he don't want you thinking like the
[1:10:37] human being he don't want you handing
[1:10:39] your problems like a human being he
[1:10:41] don't want you you know uh uh uh just
[1:10:44] living life just like a human being
[1:10:45] there is a higher thought there is a
[1:10:48] higher power there is a higher life
[1:10:51] there is a higher nature a higher way
[1:10:57] do you believe that so then they that
[1:10:59] are in the flesh cannot please God but
[1:11:02] you're not in the flesh but in the
[1:11:04] spirit if so be that the spirit of God
[1:11:07] dwelleth in you
[1:11:13] I I want to put this scripture in here
[1:11:16] as well
[1:11:17] Galatians 5 16.
[1:11:20] Paul says this I say then walk in the
[1:11:23] spirit everybody say walk in the spirit
[1:11:25] what's the results you shall not fulfill
[1:11:29] the lust of the flesh
[1:11:31] walk in the spirit and you shall not
[1:11:34] fulfill the lust of the flesh
[1:11:35] ain't that right for the flesh what the
[1:11:39] flesh lusteth
[1:11:41] against the spirit the flesh warths
[1:11:44] against the spirit now Satan comes to
[1:11:46] you on the carnal side
[1:11:49] ain't that right
[1:11:50] God deals with you on the spiritual side
[1:11:55] so the flesh lusteth against the spirit
[1:11:58] and the spirit against the flesh for
[1:12:00] these are contrary the one to the other
[1:12:03] so that you cannot do the things that
[1:12:06] you would ain't that right now notice
[1:12:08] what brother Brown said if you haven't
[1:12:10] received it talking about the Holy Ghost
[1:12:12] then how can you believe in miracles
[1:12:16] see there there's an element of Faith
[1:12:18] there's an element that that we've got
[1:12:20] to rise to and that's what the Holy
[1:12:21] Ghost is to you and I that's what it
[1:12:23] means being the body of Jesus Christ
[1:12:26] is it actually lifts us up from the
[1:12:28] carnal realm into a spiritual realm it
[1:12:32] lifts our faith to just just the the
[1:12:34] materialistic things Amen to the
[1:12:36] spiritual things you realize there's a
[1:12:39] whole world of the spiritual things that
[1:12:41] we can have uh promises that we can have
[1:12:46] it's true now see he says so if you
[1:12:50] haven't received the Holy Ghost how do
[1:12:51] you believe in miracles how can you
[1:12:54] see that takes God in you to believe you
[1:12:57] act like God you know like God you think
[1:13:02] like God the Bible says that your
[1:13:04] amateur little Gods Jesus said so for
[1:13:07] you are a part of God
[1:13:10] [Music]
[1:13:11] you with me
[1:13:13] just the same as I'm a little Branham
[1:13:15] and you're a little whoever you are
[1:13:17] because your parents is that name the
[1:13:20] nature that you are is because your
[1:13:22] parents is that way because you were
[1:13:24] born of them and the reason that you
[1:13:27] believe God and Believe In Miracles and
[1:13:29] signs and wonders is because your sons
[1:13:32] and daughters of God you receive life
[1:13:36] amen so this natural life has natural
[1:13:40] characteristics and it all deals in the
[1:13:42] material it all deals in the carnal it
[1:13:45] all deals with what we see and what we
[1:13:47] hear the five senses
[1:13:49] and and even even our are the five
[1:13:51] senses of the spirit is affected uh
[1:13:54] memory reasoning conscience and
[1:13:56] affection or all of these things it's
[1:14:00] affected by that but then there's
[1:14:02] something that takes over
[1:14:05] it's another life
[1:14:07] yeah
[1:14:09] brother Brown said when the blood of the
[1:14:11] Lord Jesus was offered the Life of
[1:14:13] Christ which was God comes on the
[1:14:16] believer
[1:14:19] then what does it make you God's
[1:14:25] God's
[1:14:27] can you say that with me we are gods
[1:14:30] where gods don't think the way the world
[1:14:32] thinks it now
[1:14:34] this isn't the world putting you on a
[1:14:37] pedestal making you a god
[1:14:39] this is God's life making you a god
[1:14:42] you can't be a God I mean yeah you can
[1:14:45] be worshiped that's that's what I guess
[1:14:47] that's what the word god means but this
[1:14:49] there's a more greater meaning to this
[1:14:52] right there
[1:14:53] that means that you're not the victim
[1:14:55] anymore
[1:14:56] you're not a slave to sin anymore
[1:14:58] you actually you actually as a mortal
[1:15:02] being can have a higher process of
[1:15:04] thought
[1:15:07] as a as a mortal being you can actually
[1:15:10] come up into another level of living
[1:15:13] now they're trying to make it that way
[1:15:15] through through psychologists and
[1:15:18] through positive thinking and positive
[1:15:20] this and positive that but we're not
[1:15:22] talking about the world
[1:15:24] you you can't be anything that I'm
[1:15:26] talking about without the Holy Ghost
[1:15:29] ain't that right we're talking about
[1:15:32] adoption
[1:15:34] ain't that right so now notice uh the
[1:15:38] prophet said speaking of Adam he had
[1:15:40] full domain over the Dominion of the
[1:15:43] world he give him dominion over all
[1:15:46] things
[1:15:48] he lost his godship he lost his sonship
[1:15:51] he lost his domain and Satan took it
[1:15:53] over
[1:15:54] but everybody say but and aren't you
[1:15:56] glad for that but brother we are waiting
[1:15:59] for the manifestations of the sons of
[1:16:01] God who will come back and take it over
[1:16:05] again
[1:16:09] coming back
[1:16:10] to take it over again
[1:16:12] see waiting for the fullness of time
[1:16:15] when the pyramid gets up to the top when
[1:16:17] the full sons of God will be manifested
[1:16:20] when the power of God will walk out
[1:16:22] Hallelujah and will take every Power
[1:16:25] that Satan's got away from him
[1:16:29] hmm
[1:16:32] God in you
[1:16:34] omnipotence in you
[1:16:37] stripping Satan of all of his power
[1:16:40] who little old me little old you
[1:16:44] insignificant to the world
[1:16:47] but significant to God
[1:16:49] can you say Amen because it's through
[1:16:52] you that he defeats his own enemy
[1:16:55] that's right amen ain't that right
[1:16:59] so brother Brown said he made man of God
[1:17:02] a God in his domain
[1:17:05] and his domain goes from sea to Sea from
[1:17:07] Shore to Shore he has the control of it
[1:17:11] so we find that the prophets were called
[1:17:15] Gods why
[1:17:18] because the word of the Lord came to
[1:17:21] them
[1:17:23] the word of the Lord
[1:17:25] and Jesus was God
[1:17:28] for he was the word made flesh
[1:17:31] ain't that right
[1:17:33] now notice
[1:17:35] look look at the power that that look
[1:17:37] look at the supernatural that Moses
[1:17:39] exhibited look look at the supernatural
[1:17:42] that uh that that that that that that
[1:17:44] Samson then that that down down Through
[1:17:47] the Ages look at the prophets and and
[1:17:50] and what they've done and exhibited what
[1:17:53] was it it was it was a supernatural
[1:17:56] beyond their natural
[1:17:57] strengths ain't that right then Here
[1:18:00] Comes Jesus the fullness of the word
[1:18:04] and here in Mark 11 12 on the moral when
[1:18:08] they
[1:18:11] now he was hungry as a man
[1:18:14] starving as a man
[1:18:17] I don't know about you when you get
[1:18:19] hungry I get cranky when I get hungry I
[1:18:21] get a little cranky
[1:18:22] I know oh my but that's just the way it
[1:18:25] is
[1:18:28] takes a lot of Grace
[1:18:32] so here Jesus as a man he's hungry
[1:18:37] and sing a fig tree afar off having
[1:18:41] leaves
[1:18:42] he came if happily
[1:18:44] hoping that he could find some fruit
[1:18:49] and when he came to it he found nothing
[1:18:51] but leaves for the time of figs was not
[1:18:54] yet
[1:18:55] so here's a man
[1:18:57] that is hungry
[1:18:59] he's hoping to get some food from that
[1:19:02] tree
[1:19:03] and Jesus answered and said unto this
[1:19:07] tree
[1:19:08] no man eat from you from this day
[1:19:10] forward
[1:19:15] Michael's heard it
[1:19:17] so
[1:19:18] the Bible says that Jesus just went on
[1:19:22] now they they just see this man that's
[1:19:24] hungry
[1:19:25] he wants something to eat
[1:19:28] there's no food
[1:19:30] so now he's speaking something
[1:19:33] no man eat from you from here on
[1:19:36] cursed it right
[1:19:38] he just walks away
[1:19:40] you don't just sit around and say okay
[1:19:42] let's just build a tent right here and
[1:19:44] see if this thing happens
[1:19:46] not he goes on to Jerusalem and the
[1:19:49] Bible says that in the morning as they
[1:19:51] pass by they saw the fig tree dried up
[1:19:55] from its roots
[1:19:58] a man that was hungering looking for
[1:20:01] food but yet would speak a word that
[1:20:05] that tree had to obey
[1:20:07] that word affected that tree
[1:20:12] did it not it was dried up from the
[1:20:16] roots and Peter calling to remembrance
[1:20:19] said unto him Master behold the Fig Tree
[1:20:22] which thou curds is withered away
[1:20:26] and Jesus didn't say yeah you got to be
[1:20:28] kidding me
[1:20:30] no
[1:20:31] what he knew his word would affect
[1:20:38] ain't that right
[1:20:40] and Jesus so Jesus didn't act old like
[1:20:44] wow you know sometimes when miracles
[1:20:46] happen we just like whoa it happened
[1:20:48] it shouldn't be that way
[1:20:52] when you ask something in faith positive
[1:20:56] you've got to know it's going to happen
[1:21:01] if you said it if you prayed it then
[1:21:06] don't worry about it
[1:21:10] hello
[1:21:12] so now Jesus is saying he answers and
[1:21:15] says have faith in God now we know all
[1:21:18] we know what that really means
[1:21:19] interpreting have the faith of God right
[1:21:23] not just will I believe in God no
[1:21:25] possess the very faith
[1:21:28] and remember omnipotence dwells in you
[1:21:32] right so the the the attributes of God
[1:21:35] is now within the in you you're an
[1:21:38] attribute of God anyways right so verily
[1:21:41] I say unto you that whosoever shall say
[1:21:44] unto this mountain be thou removed and
[1:21:46] be thou cast into the sea and shall not
[1:21:48] doubt in his heart but shall believe
[1:21:50] that those things which I saith did he
[1:21:53] say it that way no not if I say but if
[1:21:56] you say
[1:21:58] ain't that right see that that those
[1:22:02] that whosoever shall say unto this
[1:22:04] mountain be thou removed and be thou
[1:22:05] cast in the sea shall not doubt in his
[1:22:09] heart but shall believe that those
[1:22:11] things which he saith
[1:22:13] shall come to pass he shall have
[1:22:17] whatsoever he saith
[1:22:21] so then the man that is speaking is
[1:22:23] positive
[1:22:25] he's so positive that what he says is
[1:22:28] going to come to pass
[1:22:31] right
[1:22:32] yes sir
[1:22:33] that he has whatever he says therefore I
[1:22:36] say unto you whatsoever things you
[1:22:38] desire When you pray believe that you
[1:22:40] receive him and you shall have them
[1:22:44] so prayer must be based off of positive
[1:22:48] words must be positive the request must
[1:22:51] be positive
[1:22:54] ain't that right so you shall say
[1:22:58] you shall say this could not happen
[1:23:01] without the word coming to us
[1:23:06] if the word coming to the prophets made
[1:23:08] them God that same word coming to us
[1:23:11] makes us what
[1:23:12] gods
[1:23:15] ain't that right now the prophet said
[1:23:18] the word is in the bride
[1:23:21] amen
[1:23:23] oh I hope you're you're understanding I
[1:23:26] I know it's simple so but but it's
[1:23:28] Sunday night
[1:23:29] the work is in the bride
[1:23:33] where's it at in the bride
[1:23:39] there's a lot in that statement
[1:23:41] and the mind of Christ into what he once
[1:23:44] done with the word
[1:23:46] can I ask you to know what he wants done
[1:23:47] with the word
[1:23:49] oh I'm so grateful for the promises yeah
[1:23:51] I just wish you remember
[1:23:54] is like that little old lady that had
[1:23:57] all that and she was she was just broke
[1:23:59] poor as poor could be
[1:24:02] she got a son over India you know I
[1:24:04] think it was India
[1:24:05] and one of the investigators came into
[1:24:07] the home
[1:24:09] and and started talking to her and he
[1:24:11] said man why are you living like this
[1:24:13] you know well I got a son he's a just
[1:24:14] beautiful you know love him to pieces
[1:24:17] and and all that and he says oh well and
[1:24:20] he sends me postcards you know and he
[1:24:22] says really yeah so she shows him the
[1:24:24] postcards and he's really looking at
[1:24:26] that and
[1:24:28] and he said ma'am

[1:24:33] says ma'am these ain't postcards

[1:24:46] living living poor
[1:24:49] and yet right under her nose
[1:24:52] is the means
[1:24:55] to live wealthy
[1:24:59] now Church
[1:25:02] I can understand the church living poor
[1:25:06] we talk about the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:25:08] all the blood of Jesus and yet we just
[1:25:10] live like just barely making it
[1:25:13] I can understand through them Church
[1:25:14] ages but today
[1:25:19] I I just have a problem

[1:26:07] if it took you'll never get spiritual
[1:26:09] without Christ
[1:26:10] and if it took you getting spiritual
[1:26:12] then God wouldn't have come into you in
[1:26:14] the first place
[1:26:15] he saved you when you was a nobody he
[1:26:18] called you when you was unworthy and
[1:26:20] you're still unworthy had not had been
[1:26:22] forgot to save you and to come and fill
[1:26:26] you with his life
[1:26:28] what else could we expect
[1:26:36] now notice the words in the bride
[1:26:38] and the mind of Christ
[1:26:41] to know what he wants done with the word
[1:26:44] so now we're not just sitting here you

[1:28:19] word he has to bow to it
[1:28:23] he has to now in Revelations 1 or 10 8
[1:28:26] John is told to take the book from the
[1:28:29] angel and eat it
[1:28:31] and after he takes the book
[1:28:33] he eats that right and then what does

[1:31:16] Mortal human being and said that's an
[1:31:18] easy guy I'll take out he took all my
[1:31:21] weaknesses and said I'll destroy him but
[1:31:23] the word is in the bride
[1:31:26] therefore nothing can harm me not even
[1:31:29] death if he takes me by the way of the
[1:31:31] Grave one these days I'm coming up
[1:31:36] can you say man there's something
[1:31:38] positive about this the secret is the
[1:31:41] word is already in you
[1:31:50] this is all right
[1:31:52] [Applause]
[1:31:53] then he says the bride has the mind of
[1:31:55] Christ
[1:31:57] not carnal mind
[1:31:59] carnal mind there's no way out
[1:32:01] but we have the mind of Christ
[1:32:03] the wall is there
[1:32:05] there's nothing impossible with God
[1:32:11] for she knows what he once done with the
[1:32:13] word and notice she performs everybody
[1:32:16] say she performs
[1:32:18] oh I wish I'd get it to you
[1:32:21] God just give it to us
[1:32:23] the word is in the bride she knows what
[1:32:27] she wants done he wants done with it
[1:32:29] she performs
[1:32:32] now brother Terry I don't know what
[1:32:33] perform means but it has to be some
[1:32:35] action to that
[1:32:37] it has to be a an action word that that
[1:32:41] speaks of the Bride
[1:32:42] she receives it in his name she re he
[1:32:45] shows her his Word of Life she receives
[1:32:48] it she never doubts it she has the mind
[1:32:50] of Christ
[1:32:52] she knows what he wants done with that
[1:32:54] word and she performs
[1:32:57] she's just not sitting there will I need
[1:32:58] to listen to another tape
[1:33:02] all of them are so good but I just don't
[1:33:04] know
[1:33:05] no she performs the command of the word
[1:33:09] in his name for she has thus saith the
[1:33:12] Lord
[1:33:13] I don't know you
[1:33:15] can I ask you how else you're going to
[1:33:17] make it in a rapture
[1:33:18] how is she going to receive body change
[1:33:21] come on Church
[1:33:23] how else are you coming into all these
[1:33:25] things
[1:33:28] by the word of the Lord
[1:33:30] by the word of the Lord the word coming
[1:33:33] from these mortal lips the word coming
[1:33:35] from your lips
[1:33:36] can you say Amen now amen yes sir it's
[1:33:40] good to have a preacher yeah that you've
[1:33:42] got to have a preacher amen but but what
[1:33:44] good is the preacher if the word can't
[1:33:45] come into your life and the word can't
[1:33:48] be spoken through your mortal lips what
[1:33:50] about the preacher being gone what what
[1:33:52] about all these things you don't need
[1:33:53] the preacher coming and pet you all the
[1:33:55] time what you need is to take the word
[1:33:57] of God that you've received in your
[1:34:00] heart and let it perform you act upon
[1:34:02] that word and say devil get out of my
[1:34:04] house devil get out of my husband devil
[1:34:06] get out of my wife devil you leave my
[1:34:09] children alone in the name of the Lord
[1:34:12] and you little insignificant little uh
[1:34:15] house a dishwasher or whatever amen
[1:34:19] you've got the very word of omnipotence
[1:34:21] speaking from your mortal lips
[1:34:27] no wonder he makes us feel unworthy he
[1:34:30] makes us feel like we're just a little
[1:34:31] ant
[1:34:33] but I'm telling you you are significant
[1:34:35] when it comes to God you are valuable
[1:34:38] when it comes to God
[1:34:40] so much valuable that God yet said
[1:34:42] brother Brown said no one can take your
[1:34:44] place now you listen here now when it
[1:34:47] comes to God looking at you nobody can
[1:34:49] take your place you make somebody can
[1:34:51] take your place on the job somebody can
[1:34:53] take my place behind this Pulpit
[1:34:55] somebody can take our place anywhere
[1:34:57] else but when it comes to God nobody
[1:34:59] could take your place
[1:35:02] you're part of his body
[1:35:05] and omnipotent
[1:35:07] is in you
[1:35:09] for the word is in you
[1:35:14] people think that they have to wait for
[1:35:17] some sensation
[1:35:19] to come upon them
[1:35:21] before they begin to feel good and speak
[1:35:23] something
[1:35:27] but that ain't true
[1:35:29] you could be surrounded by an enemy him
[1:35:34] not feeling the chill bumps
[1:35:37] not being a mega meeting where the
[1:35:40] spirit of God is bouncing from wall to
[1:35:42] wall
[1:35:43] you could be right in the lowest of Hell
[1:35:45] in your life
[1:35:47] and began to speak the word of God
[1:35:51] [Music]
[1:35:53] can you say Amen
[1:35:55] you have the word
[1:35:58] for the word is in the bride
[1:36:00] the word is in the bride why I received
[1:36:04] it
[1:36:05] can you say Amen it went beyond My Five
[1:36:08] Senses it went beyond the senses of my
[1:36:11] spirit and it's got down into my soul
[1:36:13] I've received it as mine the word is now
[1:36:18] in me
[1:36:19] [Applause]
[1:36:22] amen
[1:36:24] you have the word
[1:36:27] now just meditate on it
[1:36:30] meditate meditate upon it
[1:36:34] and you will speak it
[1:36:36] ain't that right
[1:36:38] see you don't receive the word just by
[1:36:40] knowing it
[1:36:41] we got a lot of intellectuals
[1:36:44] man that can quote the Bible can quote
[1:36:46] quotes that can tell you verbatim What
[1:36:49] the quote is and where it's at on the
[1:36:50] page and what message and wow
[1:36:54] but you that's not how you receive the
[1:36:56] word
[1:36:57] is by knowing it
[1:37:00] so how do you receive the word brother
[1:37:02] Branham said by the Holy Ghost Quicken
[1:37:04] it to you
[1:37:05] ain't that right the letter kill us but
[1:37:07] the spirit giveth life then he says You
[1:37:10] must be born again and then the Holy
[1:37:13] Spirit quickens the word to you
[1:37:16] can you say man
[1:37:18] amen every time you hear the word
[1:37:20] receive it how do I receive it by
[1:37:21] believing it that's mine that's mine oh
[1:37:24] the devil's right there tell you oh it's
[1:37:26] not yours you know good and well you
[1:37:27] you're lost you know good and well you
[1:37:29] realize that sometimes this preacher
[1:37:31] deals with that just personally as well
[1:37:34] no hope there's no this there's no that
[1:37:36] you've crossed the line you've done this
[1:37:38] you've done that you knew better you
[1:37:40] know I've you know we've dealt with that
[1:37:42] as just as a child growing up
[1:37:45] Satan constantly telling you you're
[1:37:47] going to miss it you're this you're that
[1:37:48] and I didn't know how to battle with
[1:37:50] that and it sent me through depressions
[1:37:55] but because of the message of the hour
[1:37:58] I've learned to how to battle that thing
[1:38:00] devil get out of here
[1:38:02] devil you're a liar I ain't gonna listen
[1:38:05] to you I've been able to discern him
[1:38:07] between him and what is God
[1:38:10] everything negative is of the devil
[1:38:14] can you say amen and everything positive
[1:38:16] is of God for there's nothing negative
[1:38:19] in this message there's nothing negative
[1:38:21] about the word of God
[1:38:23] [Applause]
[1:38:25] amen amen
[1:38:28] I want to read what the Bible said when
[1:38:31] the angel appeared to Mary
[1:38:34] Luke 1 27
[1:38:36] we'll start there to a virgin espoused
[1:38:39] to a man
[1:38:40] whose name was Joseph
[1:38:42] of the House of David and the virgin's
[1:38:44] name was Mary
[1:38:46] and the angel came in unto her
[1:38:49] and said hell thou uh that are highly
[1:38:52] favored
[1:38:54] the Lord is with thee
[1:38:56] blessed art thou among women
[1:38:59] and when she saw him she was troubled at
[1:39:02] his saying and cast in her mind what
[1:39:04] manner of salutation this should be
[1:39:07] and the angel said unto her fear not
[1:39:10] Mary
[1:39:11] for thou Hast found favor with God
[1:39:14] oh God we found favor with him
[1:39:19] and behold Thou shalt conceive him thy
[1:39:22] womb and bring forth the son and thou
[1:39:24] shalt call his name Jesus
[1:39:26] now this is basically all that the Bible
[1:39:29] tells us of this event right
[1:39:33] is that one day Mary just coming walking
[1:39:36] along and some Angel just
[1:39:40] pops out
[1:39:42] and tells her
[1:39:43] you know
[1:39:45] but brother Branham gives us more
[1:39:47] insight
[1:39:49] and lets us in on the details
[1:39:52] and I love to read the stories of of how
[1:39:56] how brother Brown tells he tells it in
[1:39:57] several places but but how he he tells
[1:40:01] it and and Mary
[1:40:04] you know they go to church
[1:40:07] the day before
[1:40:10] and the priest is talking about what God
[1:40:12] done back then rode the Red Sea back the
[1:40:14] road back the Red Sea and this and that
[1:40:16] and and you know the prophet could tell
[1:40:19] stories you know and they get you
[1:40:21] involved
[1:40:23] and said boy how her heart how how her
[1:40:26] heart must have just leaked oh yeah
[1:40:28] oh yeah that's just that's wonderful yes
[1:40:31] sir
[1:40:32] and and they're coming home you know and
[1:40:34] and Marion is talking to Joseph and
[1:40:37] they're talking about what the the the
[1:40:38] the Pastor said
[1:40:40] said oh man yeah that was just wonderful
[1:40:42] he's talking about God how he does all
[1:40:44] them things I'm just like wow yes
[1:40:47] and
[1:40:48] Mr says but
[1:40:51] he really spoiled his sermon
[1:40:54] when he said God doesn't do these things
[1:40:56] today
[1:41:00] and she said Joseph do you believe God
[1:41:02] does them things oh yeah he still does
[1:41:06] so they're they're you know maybe kind
[1:41:08] of later on and and the prophets you
[1:41:11] know as she's going maybe going through
[1:41:13] her day but at the end of the day
[1:41:15] she she takes out the Scrolls or she
[1:41:18] says Joseph could you read read the read
[1:41:20] the scroll
[1:41:21] and he said well Mary you you yeah you
[1:41:24] you get whatever you want me to read now
[1:41:26] and so and and he tells it in a
[1:41:27] different place Joseph reading or Mary's
[1:41:29] reading or whatever but the point is
[1:41:32] is that when the Bible is open to her
[1:41:36] the Scrolls is read it's the very
[1:41:39] scripture
[1:41:42] the very scripture for unto us a child
[1:41:45] is born
[1:41:47] the whole virgin shall conceive
[1:41:51] and the prophet says it just done
[1:41:53] something to her
[1:41:55] um
[1:41:56] she'd had no idea who it was
[1:41:59] she had no idea about anything it just
[1:42:02] something quick into her heart
[1:42:05] right
[1:42:06] and and so it had burned in her and and
[1:42:10] the prophet says God put that scripture
[1:42:12] on her heart
[1:42:14] see that's what he's doing for us right
[1:42:16] now is he's laying the scriptures
[1:42:19] in our hearts
[1:42:21] [Music]
[1:42:24] now brother Brown said when God put
[1:42:26] something upon a person's heart he's
[1:42:28] ready to do something
[1:42:30] see when he puts these end-time
[1:42:32] scriptures on your heart as the prophet
[1:42:34] has done we wouldn't have even known
[1:42:36] them scriptures we wouldn't even know
[1:42:38] how to put the Bible together we didn't
[1:42:39] even know what the Rapture meant we
[1:42:42] didn't even know the order of rapture or
[1:42:44] anything but God would come and open the
[1:42:47] word to us and that lay in our hearts
[1:42:50] why because God's wanting to do
[1:42:52] something oh he wants to take you out of
[1:42:55] here but he had to put the word in your
[1:42:57] heart
[1:42:58] y'all believe that
[1:43:00] so so then the next day the prophet said
[1:43:02] she wakes up in that morning and the
[1:43:04] scripture's still there and she's
[1:43:05] meditating
[1:43:07] she's pondering over the scripture see
[1:43:10] as she's walking now see the Bible
[1:43:12] doesn't tell this but now the prophet is
[1:43:14] opening up to what Mary the condition
[1:43:16] that Mary is in she's not worried about
[1:43:19] some movie she watched she she is not
[1:43:21] worrying uh thinking about the YouTube
[1:43:23] channel she's not thinking about some
[1:43:25] jokes she's heard she's not thinking
[1:43:27] about whatever God had laid that
[1:43:30] scripture on her heart she had no idea
[1:43:32] she was the one she had no idea what was
[1:43:35] getting ready to take place but she was
[1:43:37] meditating on that scripture
[1:43:41] God Was preparing her
[1:43:48] oh
[1:43:50] that the scriptures would burn
[1:43:53] in our hearts today
[1:43:59] so she's meditating and the prophet said
[1:44:01] she was thinking on this as she went
[1:44:03] along the side of the street real early
[1:44:05] as the sun was Rising she was going up
[1:44:08] to the public well to get her daily
[1:44:10] supply of water usually the women come
[1:44:13] just a little later to get the water but
[1:44:15] Mary
[1:44:17] somehow she was led
[1:44:21] ah you know can I say it this way God
[1:44:24] his leadership does causes us to do
[1:44:27] unusual things
[1:44:29] but I want to say if you feel an unction
[1:44:32] down in your spirit to do something do
[1:44:35] it
[1:44:37] learn to be led of the Holy Ghost
[1:44:40] if you feel to pray pray
[1:44:43] don't wait don't put it off
[1:44:47] can you say Amen learn to be led if you
[1:44:51] if you watch the brother branham's life
[1:44:53] and and the story he knew how to be led
[1:44:57] he could be led down at the will look at
[1:44:59] angel mama look at the story of there he
[1:45:01] was supposed to fly out but the Lord
[1:45:03] told him keep on walking
[1:45:05] what if he didn't know that voice what
[1:45:07] if he couldn't obey that voice and I'm
[1:45:09] telling you God's leading us to a
[1:45:11] Rapture God's leading us we are his body
[1:45:14] not we're not here to serve our own
[1:45:17] purpose we're here to serve his purpose
[1:45:19] and we must be led by his spirit and if
[1:45:23] that leading as long as that leading
[1:45:25] doesn't come out of the Bible amen and
[1:45:27] be contrary to this Bible you understand
[1:45:29] what I'm saying
[1:45:31] learn to be led
[1:45:37] so she was led to go early that morning
[1:45:40] broke the routine but God had a reason
[1:45:42] for it
[1:45:43] and as she walked along thinking on
[1:45:45] these things she felt a strange feeling
[1:45:47] around her you know it's usually when
[1:45:49] you're thinking about God and keeping
[1:45:51] our minds on God that God comes close to
[1:45:53] us I think that's one of the great
[1:45:55] Troubles of the people of this day we
[1:45:57] have too many other things on our mind
[1:45:59] even when we come to a healing service
[1:46:01] we seem to think well I didn't get a
[1:46:04] prayer card or perhaps I'll not be
[1:46:07] prayed for we will never ever say we
[1:46:10] will never be able to accomplish much as
[1:46:13] long as we keep thinking those kinds of
[1:46:15] thoughts quit feeling sorry for yourself
[1:46:17] maybe something didn't happen the way
[1:46:19] you thought it would happen but still
[1:46:21] keep your mind upon God God is infinite
[1:46:24] God knows he's all-powerful he can move
[1:46:27] Heaven and Hell just for you
[1:46:32] you believe it
[1:46:35] so then the angel of the Lord came to
[1:46:38] Mary because it was time
[1:46:40] it was time
[1:46:42] for Isaiah's prophecy to be fulfilled
[1:46:46] can you say man and God had prepared her
[1:46:50] by putting to to receive it by putting
[1:46:53] the scripture down inside her and she
[1:46:55] began to meditate she began to think
[1:46:57] upon it she began to dwell upon it amen
[1:47:00] see and yet she didn't know it until the
[1:47:04] angel of the Lord spoke to her that she
[1:47:07] was that virgin girl that she was
[1:47:09] meditating about
[1:47:11] can you say amen and in church I just
[1:47:14] want to tell you the angel of the Lord
[1:47:15] is here he has shown himself night after
[1:47:18] night after night he didn't leave with
[1:47:21] the prophet that angel of the Lord is
[1:47:23] still here with his people do you
[1:47:26] believe that I just believe that and
[1:47:28] what's he doing he's preparing our
[1:47:30] hearts
[1:47:32] and he's letting us know you're the one
[1:47:34] that these prophecies speak of you're
[1:47:37] the people that is ready for a Rapture
[1:47:39] you are the people that the adoption is
[1:47:42] for you're that people and what do we
[1:47:44] say be it unto me according to Thy Word
[1:47:48] we're meditating on it
[1:47:54] see she didn't know it
[1:47:57] she's just meditating
[1:47:59] until the angel of the Lord opened the
[1:48:02] mystery to her
[1:48:04] then she saw herself
[1:48:06] in the prophecy
[1:48:08] can you say Amen
[1:48:10] and she only had one visitation
[1:48:13] and that was enough for her
[1:48:16] and we've seen the visitation of the
[1:48:18] Angel night after night
[1:48:20] foreign
[1:48:21] us
[1:48:25] getting your same man
[1:48:26] and notice
[1:48:28] she caught the word
[1:48:30] that came to her
[1:48:32] ain't that right
[1:48:34] yes sir she caught it see so now the
[1:48:37] angel of the Lord that is here Among Us
[1:48:38] is open the mystery that has been hidden
[1:48:41] in the mind of God since the foundation
[1:48:43] of the world
[1:48:44] and what's he doing it's this day that
[1:48:47] he is showing his elect that they are
[1:48:49] the prophecy
[1:48:51] they are do you believe you're the
[1:48:52] prophecy you're the prophecy yes sir we
[1:48:56] are to do the Greater Works we are to
[1:48:58] speak and our words come to pass do you
[1:49:00] realize that that scripture that we just
[1:49:02] read about Jesus speaking to that fig
[1:49:04] tree and he turned around and said but
[1:49:06] if you shall say you realize that
[1:49:07] scripture is laid dormant until this age
[1:49:10] and the Lord showed brother Branham
[1:49:12] exactly what he meant by that scripture
[1:49:14] and he spoke squirrels into existence
[1:49:17] ain't that right brother random put that
[1:49:19] scripture with that event he said I
[1:49:22] never knew exactly what that scripture
[1:49:24] meant right and there he was needing
[1:49:26] squirrel
[1:49:28] I hadn't seen the squirrel at all
[1:49:31] and then the Whirlwind dropped down and
[1:49:33] the presence of the Lord come into the
[1:49:35] woods and he said how many squirrel do
[1:49:37] you want ain't that right
[1:49:39] and remember it was the power of brother
[1:49:42] branham's words
[1:49:44] and it wasn't brother Branham it was
[1:49:45] omnipotent speaking through their mortal
[1:49:48] lips
[1:49:49] and yet yet God attributed to the
[1:49:51] brother random speaking for remember he
[1:49:53] he he got that ones girl
[1:49:56] and he was so excited he was going to go
[1:49:59] home
[1:50:00] I would want to go home too show my wife
[1:50:02] look at this I spoke this into creation
[1:50:07] I mean that would have been excited
[1:50:09] right
[1:50:11] but God held him to it
[1:50:12] but you said
[1:50:15] three
[1:50:18] why it came out of mortal lips but it
[1:50:21] could not be defeated
[1:50:24] because Jesus said my word Heaven and
[1:50:26] Earth will pass away but my word will
[1:50:28] not pass away
[1:50:30] you say yeah but that was God speaking
[1:50:32] that was Jesus speaking but what about
[1:50:34] you
[1:50:36] deity is in you omnipotence is in you
[1:50:40] don't take your words lightly don't take
[1:50:43] this message lightly don't take the
[1:50:45] promises of God lightly how else are you
[1:50:47] going to defeat the Devil
[1:50:52] I'm not crazy it's the word if the word
[1:50:57] that was spoken by God is in you
[1:51:04] you shall say
[1:51:06] you shall speak
[1:51:09] and whatever you say
[1:51:11] it'll be done
[1:51:15] is this all right
[1:51:18] see we are to speak and our own words
[1:51:21] come to pass
[1:51:23] in this day
[1:51:24] we are the bride of Christ we are what
[1:51:27] did the prophet say we are if I say we
[1:51:30] are
[1:51:30] the final voice
[1:51:34] to the final age
[1:51:37] the last word of God that the devil will
[1:51:39] hear is coming out of your mouth my
[1:51:42] mouth the mouth of this bride we are the
[1:51:45] final voice to the final age
[1:51:51] prophets didn't go
[1:51:56] yeah okay played the tapes I mean play
[1:51:58] the tapes you need to play the tapes at
[1:52:00] your home play the tapes
[1:52:05] and I'm going to say this respectfully
[1:52:09] but when your child needs healed
[1:52:14] you're going to play a tape
[1:52:16] or are you going to take what is in them
[1:52:18] tapes and you've received and you're
[1:52:20] going to speak that word yourself
[1:52:25] I believe in playing tapes I play it all
[1:52:29] the time my wife plays at my home plays
[1:52:31] it we want tapes in our home
[1:52:36] I don't think it's a sin to play tapes
[1:52:38] in the church if people want to play
[1:52:40] tapes in the church I don't have no
[1:52:42] problem
[1:52:43] but I am telling you there is a
[1:52:45] five-fold Ministry but beyond that
[1:52:47] faithful Ministry there is a people that
[1:52:49] have received the word for this age
[1:52:52] [Applause]
[1:52:59] I know I've kept you
[1:53:01] and I'm sorry
[1:53:03] kinda
[1:53:06] I'm having fun
[1:53:07] so I hope you're enjoying it I will
[1:53:11] close though I promise you but I do want
[1:53:13] to read this one
[1:53:15] brother Brandon said Mary's womb the
[1:53:17] physical mind
[1:53:18] was womb virgin womb
[1:53:21] why she believed God's word
[1:53:25] no matter how much anybody criticized
[1:53:28] how many things somebody else said that
[1:53:31] didn't have one thing to do with it she
[1:53:33] believed God's word regardless
[1:53:36] now you could feel the passion in the
[1:53:38] prophet when he says oh I wished I could
[1:53:41] get this over
[1:53:45] are you getting it he says
[1:53:48] first was her mind
[1:53:51] before the act ever taken place in her
[1:53:54] literal womb the ACT had to take place
[1:53:57] in here to let the Spirit come in to do
[1:54:01] the rest of the work
[1:54:03] Glory before the actual spiritual birth
[1:54:06] can take place the word has to find
[1:54:09] itself through your mind and believe it
[1:54:13] he that heareth my words and believeth
[1:54:16] on him that sent me hath every eternal
[1:54:19] life and shall never come to judgment
[1:54:21] see or through the tribulation period
[1:54:24] but has passed from Death unto life
[1:54:26] that's it oh my see now notice virgin
[1:54:28] womb her mind a virgin mind to believe
[1:54:31] God's word you say now look here oh say
[1:54:34] brother Brian I mean it couldn't be that
[1:54:35] way it's impossible John Wesley would
[1:54:38] have saw it and so and so would have saw
[1:54:39] it uh-huh see sure the devil could have
[1:54:42] said the same thing to Mary who are you
[1:54:46] you know why you're the poorest of the
[1:54:48] city you ain't nothing but a youngin 16
[1:54:50] years old 18. how down here packing
[1:54:53] water out of this pump father dead your
[1:54:56] mother old blind woman down there how in
[1:54:58] the world you ever you know how see Anne
[1:55:01] was her mother we're told how in the
[1:55:03] world are you ever going to do that see
[1:55:05] listen to my old mother she is a blind
[1:55:08] woman but she is a Godly woman
[1:55:10] now listen what brother Brown's now
[1:55:12] speaking and saying what Mary is saying
[1:55:14] see listen my old mother is a blind
[1:55:17] woman but she's a Godly woman now he's
[1:55:20] she's putting it back in his face
[1:55:23] she ain't gonna listen to that she ain't
[1:55:25] gonna set still and let them things come
[1:55:28] in her mind
[1:55:30] she's already heard the voice of the
[1:55:31] Angel she's received that word she ain't
[1:55:33] going to receive any other word
[1:55:36] you with me so now she's going to Bath
[1:55:39] see but she's a Godly woman and through
[1:55:41] her lips she's planted a seed in my
[1:55:43] heart I've read it out of God's word
[1:55:45] that God said in Isaiah 9 6 a virgin
[1:55:49] shall conceive so now she is comparing
[1:55:52] the experience that she had with that
[1:55:53] angel to what the Bible says
[1:55:56] amen amen
[1:55:58] hallelujah can you see the word takes
[1:56:01] flesh
[1:56:03] there you are God is going to have a
[1:56:05] church it's going to be born of the word
[1:56:07] of God because it is the Living Word of
[1:56:10] God he said do you see it how you know
[1:56:13] why see you know what you're going to be
[1:56:16] called from this from this on see he
[1:56:19] said you know what you're going to be
[1:56:20] called from this on you're going to be
[1:56:21] called see I don't care what I'm called
[1:56:24] that has nothing about it be it unto me
[1:56:27] according to the word of the Lord
[1:56:30] oh could everybody say that today oh if
[1:56:34] people could really from your heart all
[1:56:35] of us could say that be it unto me
[1:56:37] according to Thy word Lord see my really
[1:56:40] mean it one or two or somewhere out in
[1:56:42] there it's gonna pick up some
[1:56:44] predestinated that really means that
[1:56:48] can you say man it's going to pick you
[1:56:50] up one of these days
[1:56:52] you hear saying be it unto me according
[1:56:55] to Thy word you keep saying that you
[1:56:57] really receive that it's going to pick
[1:56:59] you up one of these days
[1:57:02] brother you're going to see sparks
[1:57:04] flying right then see when you really
[1:57:06] get got that there to meet what with
[1:57:08] that what's coming that irrigation
[1:57:10] begins to fall on that heart now what
[1:57:12] was it a virgin mind womb virgin womb
[1:57:16] for the baby results
[1:57:18] eternal life
[1:57:19] amen see Eve a good woman as she was
[1:57:22] virgin as she was but first she let the
[1:57:25] doubt come in by the word a devil's lie
[1:57:28] and what did he do he brought her in
[1:57:31] contact in the wrong way and what was
[1:57:33] her child death but Mary's Child was
[1:57:36] life
[1:57:37] if the musicians will come
[1:57:41] brother Brian even gives us a insight
[1:57:45] on the woman at the well because all we
[1:57:48] see is the woman coming to the well
[1:57:50] and the Messiah Jesus coming to her
[1:57:56] brother rounds to that little lady knew
[1:58:00] in her heart she had done wrong
[1:58:03] she knew that she was an ill-famed woman
[1:58:07] and he says and as she was going to the
[1:58:10] well
[1:58:12] no doubt she was thinking of how she had
[1:58:16] ruined her life and how sorry she was
[1:58:20] but then she thought
[1:58:22] someday
[1:58:25] some Glorious Day the great Messiah will
[1:58:28] come
[1:58:29] and when he comes
[1:58:32] he will straighten us out
[1:58:35] here's Satan no doubt was beating your
[1:58:37] mind you little unworthy you
[1:58:39] little old insignificant thing I'll
[1:58:41] destroy your life look at you you're a
[1:58:44] mess you ain't even accepted in society
[1:58:46] and there it was but then there was a
[1:58:49] meditation oh some Glorious Day Messiah
[1:58:53] will come
[1:58:54] and will straighten us out
[1:58:58] and then brother Brown said that's why
[1:59:00] we miss God so much we're thinking about
[1:59:01] other things instead of him think
[1:59:05] on him
[1:59:08] can you say Amen
[1:59:10] thank on what he has promised
[1:59:14] for this day
[1:59:16] think on what he is doing in this day
[1:59:19] think on what he said about your future
[1:59:23] in the word of God don't let Satan lie
[1:59:27] to you and build your future before you
[1:59:30] of Doom and Gloom
[1:59:32] foreign
[1:59:35] God is already predestinated your future
[1:59:38] he's already declared your future
[1:59:39] meditate upon it let your thoughts be
[1:59:42] this what God Said can you say Amen the
[1:59:45] word is in the bride
[1:59:47] [Music]
[1:59:55] why would Jesus promise that we would do
[1:59:57] the Greater Works if we won't do them
[2:00:00] why would Jesus promise and give us the
[2:00:03] last commission to the church and you
[2:00:05] know what that last commission is
[2:00:07] though you therefore and preach the
[2:00:09] gospel to Every Creature Every Nation
[2:00:14] he that believeth shall be saved he that
[2:00:16] believeth not shall be damned
[2:00:18] these signs shall follow them that
[2:00:20] believe in my name they'll cast out
[2:00:22] Devils they'll heal the sick lay their
[2:00:24] hands on the sick they shall recover
[2:00:26] they'll drink any deadly thing and it
[2:00:28] shall not hurt them they'll pick up
[2:00:31] serpents and it shall not harm them
[2:00:33] right
[2:00:35] that's the last Commission
[2:00:37] and brother Brown said remember he said
[2:00:39] that he said that so it has to be
[2:00:44] and he wouldn't have said that unless
[2:00:47] there's somebody there's going to be
[2:00:49] somebody that can catch that word
[2:00:51] just like the loom of Mary could catch
[2:00:53] the germ a virgin shall conceive she
[2:00:56] caught it a virgin shall conceive
[2:00:59] she had that to catch that word
[2:01:03] before it come to pass she caught it
[2:01:05] right
[2:01:09] every word
[2:01:10] before the Rapture takes place you got
[2:01:12] to catch it in your womb
[2:01:14] all these promises you got to catch it
[2:01:17] in your womb
[2:01:18] foreign
[2:01:21] [Music]
[2:01:27] could catch the germ a virgin shall
[2:01:29] conceive like a palm tree could be
[2:01:31] created an old kill an oak tree on a
[2:01:34] hill his word didn't can you say Amen
[2:01:38] hey I'm going to read a series of quotes
[2:01:41] till you're just right fast because I
[2:01:43] don't want to quit until then but he
[2:01:46] said let's be positive in our thinking
[2:01:48] let's believe and he's talking to a a
[2:01:51] certain church but he said let's believe
[2:01:53] that this night now the Revival will
[2:01:56] break in an angless Temple tonight let's
[2:01:59] believe that this is the night that God
[2:02:01] will do the exceeding abundantly above
[2:02:04] all that we could do or thing he will do
[2:02:06] it tonight don't take no for an answer
[2:02:12] amen it's when you think those things
[2:02:14] you create an atmosphere around you
[2:02:17] another place it's a strange thing that
[2:02:19] this is so much thought of people they
[2:02:21] say well I'm weak my faith is not very
[2:02:24] much I'm not a very good Christian
[2:02:26] that's just what the devil wants you to
[2:02:30] say and you're talking his language then
[2:02:32] that's what he says you're talking his
[2:02:35] language right then
[2:02:36] well I'm not worthy I just don't know if
[2:02:38] I'll get healed I just don't know if I'm
[2:02:40] going to make it quit talking his
[2:02:42] language you're talking that ain't the
[2:02:43] word
[2:02:45] and you say man so this is telling us
[2:02:48] that the devil's language is a language
[2:02:50] of defeat
[2:02:52] hopelessness
[2:02:53] unbelief
[2:02:55] negativity worry y'all with me brother
[2:03:00] Brown said never permit a negative
[2:03:02] thought to come into your mind if you
[2:03:03] can help it when it starts when it
[2:03:07] starts that don't entertain it well you
[2:03:10] say I can't help the thoughts from
[2:03:11] coming well that'll be like the farmer
[2:03:14] that said he couldn't stop the the birds
[2:03:16] from flying over his place but he could
[2:03:19] sure stop them from building a roost see
[2:03:21] from from from roosting see that's a
[2:03:24] good thing you see you can't help the
[2:03:26] thoughts when they come but don't
[2:03:28] entertain them just pass it on
[2:03:31] [Music]
[2:03:33] every thought that comes in your mind
[2:03:35] don't mean that you
[2:03:37] don't mean that that's you
[2:03:39] you're not that person
[2:03:41] can you say man it's just thoughts that
[2:03:44] are floating through
[2:03:46] but discern what thought to hold on to
[2:03:49] and what thought to let go
[2:03:51] pass on
[2:03:53] when you get to thinking about Divine
[2:03:55] Healing get to thinking about Christ
[2:03:56] keep your mind on him if there be any
[2:03:58] praise if there be any virtue the Bible
[2:04:00] says think on these things if any
[2:04:02] thought comes by well maybe it just
[2:04:05] couldn't be sold get off that get up get
[2:04:08] it off your mind right quick think on
[2:04:10] things that's positive never let a
[2:04:14] negative thought pass through don't let
[2:04:16] it stop anyhow if it starts to keep your
[2:04:20] thoughts positive
[2:04:24] that speaks to all of us don't it keep
[2:04:27] your thoughts pops
[2:04:30] don't think sitting there in the
[2:04:31] wheelchair that you're hopeless and
[2:04:33] helpless you're not
[2:04:34] [Music]
[2:04:35] brother I'm speaking that to a to a
[2:04:38] person in the wheelchair that he ain't
[2:04:40] asking them how long have you will not
[2:04:41] walk but you're born like this but he
[2:04:43] ain't asking psychology questions
[2:04:46] [Music]
[2:04:47] he's basing in a formal word of God
[2:04:51] any of you that are crippled sitting in
[2:04:53] a wheelchair
[2:04:55] don't let that thought well
[2:04:58] I'll just always be this way I'm
[2:05:00] helpless he says you're not don't let
[2:05:03] that negative thought ever pass through
[2:05:04] don't let it anchor
[2:05:07] you can't help it going from going
[2:05:10] through your mind but you but don't let
[2:05:12] it stop
[2:05:13] can you say Amen

[2:15:26] you do
[2:15:28] fight your enemy
[2:15:31] when
[2:15:32] [Music]
[2:15:34] you can't do it in yourself
[2:15:36] that you sure God have indicated word
[2:15:40] that you can be positive
[2:15:42] be positive in your testimony be
[2:15:44] positive in your thinking
[2:15:46] be positive in your actions
[2:15:49] I am a son of God
[2:15:52] can you say man so God bless you is our
[2:15:55] prayer
[2:15:57] uh I I'm wanting to have prayer service
[2:16:02] Tuesday at seven so if if any of you
[2:16:05] would want to come
[2:16:07] and just to pray with us we would love
[2:16:09] to have you we've got our meeting coming
[2:16:11] up and
[2:16:13] no this could be the last meeting
[2:16:16] but I I just pray God just comes down in
[2:16:20] a supernatural way that's that's my goal
[2:16:22] however he wants to do it it don't
[2:16:25] matter to me
[2:16:26] I just want God to come I want him to be
[2:16:30] there I want I want the people that that
[2:16:33] needs healing
[2:16:35] there is no disease
[2:16:38] too big for our God
[2:16:40] now I'm only honest in the Pentecostal
[2:16:43] age I saw the crippled walk I saw the
[2:16:45] blind sea I saw legs grow out
[2:16:49] That Was Then I believe it can happen
[2:16:53] if we are the body of Christ if we have
[2:16:56] the omnipotent God living in us there is
[2:16:58] nothing impossible with our God we
[2:17:01] should set the standard High we should
[2:17:05] set the bar up and say God you promised
[2:17:09] now just do it and you say man but we
[2:17:13] realize all things are possible to them
[2:17:15] that believe
[2:17:16] and I I just believe that the blind
[2:17:18] Dives can be open in our meeting we've
[2:17:21] seen it we've seen God deliver
[2:17:23] cigarette smokers just what last year
[2:17:25] two years ago the man that had cigarette
[2:17:28] problem could not quit tried to quit and
[2:17:30] God delivered him never touched a
[2:17:32] cigarette again
[2:17:33] during our meetings many has gotten the
[2:17:35] Holy Ghost my own mother was was healed
[2:17:38] in the meeting uh three I think three
[2:17:41] years ago just through the prayer
[2:17:42] brother Daryl Ward just praying and as
[2:17:45] he was praying he called out that
[2:17:48] disease that mom had didn't even know
[2:17:50] that she had it called it out and told
[2:17:51] it to leave Martin just still prays in
[2:17:53] the Lord didn't know she was healed
[2:17:55] until the next morning
[2:17:57] I'm Healed and it just never went up for
[2:18:01] prayer it was just a prayer of a servant
[2:18:04] of God and rebuked that spirit
[2:18:07] can it not happen again it can happen so
[2:18:11] God bless you is our prayer brother will
[2:18:14] would you or never mind I didn't see you
[2:18:17] walking out
[2:18:18] brother Matthew you want to pray
[2:18:22] [Music]
