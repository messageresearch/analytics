And uh so looking forward to that time uh in the Lord and um um so just keep that in in mind. And then as we've announced uh uh this week uh we're moving our midweek service from Wednesday to Tuesday.

And we uh really appreciate brother Daniel Cross uh taking the time to come up and I think it took him about four hours or so to uh get the AC running and he ordered the parts for us and and wouldn't let us pay for any of it. And uh so we really appreciate uh and brother Daniel and ask the Lord just really bless him and his labor of love that he has shown toward us here in Blackburg. &gt;&gt; Amen. And um you can stand if you don't mind and we'll uh just go into the reading of the word. And uh first of all, we're going to start in Deuteronomy the 7th chapter and uh then Isaiah 43 and um Deuteronomy chapter 7 and going to start at the I I let's let's start at the first verse. When the Lord thy God shall bring thee into the land whether thou goest to possess it, and hath cast out many nations before thee, the Hittites, the Je uh gerites, the Amorites, Canaanites, Perizzites, Hivites, Jebusites, seven nations greater and mightier than thou. And when the Lord thy God shall deliver them before thee, thou shalt smite them, and utterly destroy them, thou shalt make no covenant with them, nor show mercy unto them, neither shalt thou make marriages with them. Thy daughter thou shalt not give unto his son, nor his daughter shalt thou take unto thy son. For they will turn away thy son from following me, that they may serve other gods. So will the anger of the Lord be kindled against you and destroy thee suddenly. But thus shall ye deal with them. You shall destroy their altars, break down their images, and cut down their groves, and burn their graven images with fire. For thou art an holy people. Everybody say, "Thou art and holy people unto the Lord thy God." The Lord thy God hath chosen thee to be a special people unto himself above all people that are upon the face of the earth. The Lord did not set his love upon you, nor choose you, because you were more in number than any people, for you were the fewest of all people. But because the Lord loved you, and because he would keep the oath which he had sworn unto your fathers, hath the Lord brought you out with a mighty hand, and redeemed you out of the house of bondman, from the hand of Pharaoh, king of Egypt. Know therefore that the Lord thy God, he is God, the faithful God, which keepeth covenant and mercy with him that love him and keep his commandments to a thousand generations. Now, if you'll go Isaiah 43 and we'll start at the first verse, Isaiah 43 and1. But now thus saith the Lord that created thee, oh Jacob, and he that formed thee, O Israel, fear not, for I have redeemed thee. I have called thee by thy name. Thou art mine. When thou passest through the waters, I will be with thee, and through the rivers. They shall not overflow thee. When thou walkest through the fire, thou shalt not be burned, neither shall the flame kindle upon thee. For I am the hol the Lord thy God, the holy one of Israel thy savior. I gave Egypt for thy ransom Ethiopia and Siba for thee. Since thou was precious in my sight. Thou hast been honorable and I love thee. Therefore will I give men for thee and people for thy life. Fear not, for I am with thee. I will bring thy seed from the east and gather thee from the west. I will say to the north, give up, and to the south, keep not back. Bring my sons from far, and my daughters from the ends of the earth, even everyone that is called by my name, for I have created him for my glory. I have formed him. Yay, I have made him. And then the 21st verse, this people have I formed for myself. They shall show forth my praise. &gt;&gt; Now, one more scripture. Romans 6. Romans 6 and the 11th verse. It says, "Likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin, but alive unto God. Therefore, or through Jesus Christ our Lord. Let not sin reign, therefore reign in your mortal body, that you should obey it in the lust thereof, neither yield ye your members as instruments of unrighteousness unto sin, but yield yourselves unto God, as though as those that are alive from the dead, and your members as instruments of righteousness unto God. For sin shall not have dominion over you. For you are not under the law, but under grace. What then shall we sin? Because we are not under the law, but under grace God forbid. Know ye not that to whom you yield yourselves servants to obey, his servants you are to whom you obey, whether of sin unto death, or of obedience unto righteousness. But God be thank that you were the servants of sin. But you have obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine which was delivered you. Being then made free from sin. You became the servants of righteousness. I speak after the manner of men because of the infirmity of your flesh. For as you have yielded your members servants to uncleanness and to iniquity unto iniquity, even so now yield your members servants to righteousness unto holiness. For when you were servants of sin, you were free from righteousness. What fruit had you then? In those things whereof you are now ashamed. See, for in the end of these things is death. But now being made free from sin. How many is free from sin? &gt;&gt; And become servants to God, you have your fruit unto holiness and the end everlasting life. For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. Let's just bow our heads as we talk to the author of the word. Father, as we have read your scriptures, Father, we realize the meaning, Lord, that it holds. And yet, Father, we know that the carnal mind can read it and yet not understand it. And so, we're asking, Lord, that you would come and that you would open the scriptures up to us, Father. And Lord, that you'd reveal what you would have for us, Lord, today. You see the the heart, my heart, Lord, and uh the things that I would like to convey to your people. And I pray Lord that you would just give us a freedom to do so. And Lord uh not only me freedom to speak, but the people freedom to hear and to receive. Father, may your presence just be among us today. Work a supernatural work within us. Father, we ask it. We're your children in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. You can have your seats this morning. And so I want to I have um talked on this um subject uh holiness a people separated unto the Lord and um been I guess more talking about it um and we've been off uh offline um but I I u want to speak some more about it today and Uh we know the word holy means separated, dedicated, consecrated, appointed. And so uh God called Israel to be a people unto him. And that was a natural people. And that was a people that was typing out us as the spiritual people. They were the natural seed of Abraham. We are the spiritual royal seed of Abraham through Christ. Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; As as a separated people, God separated them for himself. And they were the only people that had the braen serpent. They were the only people that had the smitten rock, the only ones that would have the pillar of fire, the angel of the covenant, uh uh the atonement. uh they they were the only people that had the supernatural among them. The children of Israel had their faults and mistakes and you know uh but but they were God's people and they were special in the eyes of God &gt;&gt; and that's what matters. They're special in the eyes of God. And so, but if God had not given them the angel of the covenant, if he had not given them the pillar of fire, the atonement, the brazen serpent, the the uh uh smitten rock, and if he hadn't given them all these things, there would have been no way that they could have come and entered into the promised land. True. &gt;&gt; They would have been just like any other nation. uh any other people that was weak and uh failures and faults and all these things and uh but yet God loved them and God provided these things to preserve them as they were on their journey. &gt;&gt; Now God commanded them not to intermar with any other nation. uh they were not to mix and uh not toake of any of the rituals of the heathen nations were to keep themselves separated and undefiled. Amen. Because they were a holy people. Well, God as as God has turned from the Israel as a natural people to a spiritual people, the Gentiles, and he's taking out, he promised that he would take out of the Gentiles a people for his name. In other words, it would be a people that would make up the bride of Christ and that would actually become Miss Jesus Christ. they would bear that name. As we know that we have come to that place in this age where we're no longer called just church. We are called Miss Jesus Christ. Uh and and the reason why we're called that is because there has been an invisible union take place. The wedding is or the marriage wedding is not going to take uh place up in the skies or somewhere else. the marriage actually taking place now. &gt;&gt; Amen. And there are a people today that are married to the word of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. They're married. They're dedicated to that. And and so um uh uh God wants his church, his elect, his bride, separated from all other churches as as the prophet said. In other words, we are to separate from from denominations. all denominations, their false teachings, their the traditions of man, the the their creeds and dogmas and their worldly ways. And and the Bible tells us that we are not to uh fashion ourselves after the age that we live in, this leysosian age. Ain't that right? Now, as we have said, the the carnal church, they want mixers. As the prophet told us, they they want mixers. And this this is how Balum in the Old Testament caused Israel to fall. Uh uh Balam was a prophet of Moab. And Moab was a religious nation. Uh they had their own king, and that was Bailac. Uh uh he was the king of Moab. And uh the prophet said that Moab represented the nickelatans of today. And um and so uh Israel represented the true church. Amen. So you had the nickel uh a type of the nickelans and the type of the true church. And so, uh, the Moabites were descendants of Lot. Um, and and, uh, they were a product of incest. And, and there Genesis 19:36, it says, "Thus were both the daughters of Lot with child by their father, and the firstborn bear a son, and called his name Moab, the same is the father of the Moabites unto this day." So years later, uh the the seed of Abraham, uh true seed, uh they they come and and they were on their way, uh to the promised land. And uh they were going to pass through Moab, uh the country of Moab. And so they sent word to the king, um let us drink of your water. Let us uh you know let our cattle uh eat your grass and and things like that and then we will pay you uh for everything that we have taken and uh we have eaten. Well uh we we find amen that uh brother brother Ram says now you know the the king bail he got all excited because he didn't want such a meeting as that in his church or his land. he, you know, uh, he didn't want the true seed in in his coming through and and all these things. And so, uh, and and and doesn't want a genuine full gospel Pentecostal church. Amen. With signs and wonders working in it. He doesn't want that type in in in the land today. That's that's just what he doesn't he he doesn't want a church that has the true experience of Pentecost. Amen. And so uh we find that Balac he went and got uh uh the prophet of Moab uh the Moabites which was Balum. He was the prophet of the Moabites. And and he wanted him to go down and curse Israel and of course offered him some uh money. And so, uh, Ba, Balam was a hirling prophet, and he decides to go. And the Lord told him, "Don't you go. Don't you do it." But he went anyway. And so, when he opened his mouth to curse him, all he done was bless them. &gt;&gt; Amen. He couldn't curse them. He just he just every just might as well just shut up, you know, cuz every word he said was a blessing. It was prophecy. And that's still coming to pass today. &gt;&gt; Amen. the prophecies of Balum. And so uh so he couldn't curse them. So he come up with this idea. Brother Bram said he told Bailac to invite Israel to the the festival of the God. And they had a festival up there where they were going to have see uh and the festival was called the feast of Balpure. Uh, Bel Pure. Um, it was a feast to worship. And Balam said, "Now, I'll tell you, Bailo, I'll give you a good idea. Uh, uh, see, God won't cursed them. That's all there is to it. So, I'll tell you what we'll do. We can't get rid of them. But if you'll just invite them over, you'll swing the whole thing your way." So they invited all the Israelites up to this big feast and the big blowout and uh that they had and some big party shindig of a thing up there they had. And when they got up there, these Israelite people began to see these pretty sexy dressed Moabitete women. Yes. Wasn't like their common girls down there. Oh, they look so pretty. My he said and and how they were made and how they could show themselves and they fell for it and began to commit adultery. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; See, and Balam knowed if God wouldn't curse them, he'd take them over on this denominational side and cause the anger of God to kill them anyhow. Let God kill them himself. if he could ever get them out of the way of the truth. Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; See, and so the prophet says, as soon as you walk out and join a church instead of receiving the baptism of the Holy Ghost, you're dead. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? Just plain and simple, you're dead. &gt;&gt; Amen. Spiritually speaking, the life is is killed off. It's it's it's there because there's no life in a denomination. No spiritual life in denominations. Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; So, Israel began to intermar something that God told them not to do. &gt;&gt; They were supposed to keep themselves separate and to to be a holy people and they began to intermar and God never did forgive them for that. Right. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, as we know, the prophet through the in the church ages told us that that Constantine done the same thing that Balum did. And and it's mentioned in in the revelations that the the doctrine of Balum. Well, Constantine did that. The true church started on the day of Pentecost. That church had the fire of God in it. It had the signs and wonders uh following it and and following the believer and you can read uh of the things that God did through them uh uh in the book of Acts and and things. But it it started at Naia Council uh is where the first organization started which was the the Catholic Church. And and most most people think that Constantine is a Christian was a Christian. Brother Bram said he was not a Christian. He was a politician. &gt;&gt; Amen. And and so he joined up not with the true church. He joined up with the nickelans. And nickelans were lukewarm. They were formal. They they bypassed the baptism of the Holy Ghost. and they're the ones that started the troubles in the church and persecuting the true church and and on and on and on and so brother Bram said see nickelans were so-called professing Christians without the Holy Spirit he said they were Christian by name they were Christian by their gathering together they taken communion they kept the orders but rejected the leadership of the Holy Spirit they had uh no signs and wonders among them. They claimed those things were in the past and that they had to set up a church for a reign. Amen. A kingdom, a dominion. See, and so uh Constantine joined up with the Nickelans for the sole purpose uh to strengthen uh his empire, his his his kingdom. Amen. And so, Brother Brandon said he was not interested in Christianity. Amen. He had selfish motives. He had other uh motives behind his actions. And so, uh uh he just wanted to bring his pagan ancestors and his pagan church, the prophet said, to strengthen his empire as Rome always did to hold the keys to the world. Ain't that right? Amen. to conquer, divide and conquer and and and to strengthen themselves. Amen. To where they hold the keys to the world. Constantine had to bring his pagan ideas and take the Christian ideas. He took the pagan ideas, took the Christian ideas, and then put them together, consolidated them to weld this together and make himself an empire that would be second to none. In another place, he brought in pagan ceremonies over into the Nickelan Christian church. I'll call it, he says, the formal denominational church that was forming. He brought pagan ceremonies over into this nickelan church. And that was the birth of Catholicism. And we know uh uh all of that. So now now Satan is going to do it again. He's doing it again uh through the World Council of Churches. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now we know that brother Brown said it's going to happen. the same thing going to happen where the churches all get together and it's going to be uh they make an image unto the beast and it'll it'll be the world council of churches. And so the prophet said now in order to get this thing to working Constantine set up a lot of worldly entertainments uh to attract the attention of both pagan and Christians into the church. He said, "Are you spiritually minded? Are you thinking, isn't that the message of the hour? The church has bunko games, parties, giveaway cars. See, just to get them mixed together, welding that power back un together till they can get a striking place." Just right here, he said, "Now that's history. Someone has no axe to grind. They're just quoting what happened." And he's talking reading history. See, but he did it welded the church together by having worldly entertainments to bring together the nickelan church. He said, now remember, he could not touch. Everybody say he could not touch that born again church. &gt;&gt; No, he was welding not the bornagain church. He was welding the nickelan church together to strengthen his empire. See, but uh and he says he says he couldn't touch any of the the the born again, but the formal nickelan church fell for it. He says, "And what do we have in our Pentecostal churches? Soup suppers, entertainment, skating, and rag sales, and everything else." See? Amen. See, so as as we have been taught and by the message of the hour, Amen. is that there is a a worldly church, a carnal church, all the same worldly and carnal church and there is a true holy ghostfilled church. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. And and if you notice both are made up of different material. Now the prophet says that the bride has got to be clothed and and you know we may not be getting a lot of sews in. I I don't know. I think we should do our best in every way to bring souls in. Uh uh so we we do not bring that to a minute thing or deminimize this. Amen. But we know that very few people are going to make it. And it's getting narrower and narrower and narrower to where the prophet said the righteous seed's going to run out and and and and God's going to have to take this bride home. But but what we are doing is the message of the hour is clothing us. Amen. Because Amen. You say, "Well, I've been in the message for for whatever. Why are we still here?" Well, it may not be so much as getting thousands of people in, but it it may be that God is clothing us. And I say he is clothing us with the message of the hour. This bride will not be found naked. This bride will not be found unclothed, but she will be clothed with the righteousness. Can you say amen? Of the word. The word is what is doing the the clothing. And and the that's the purpose I believe with all my heart of the five-fold ministry. You ministers, we are responsible to get into this message, preach this message, study this message, listen to this message, feed off this message. Our ministry should be feeding off the message of the hour. &gt;&gt; Amen. We are responsible to preach this message. Amen. But if you notice both churches, the Holy Ghost fil church and that carnal uh church u uh they're they're they're they're both made up of different material. Amen. The prophet says, see, it takes a cypress a cypress material to make a cypress boat, cypress tree, right? Cypress material to make a cypress boat. It takes a popular material to make a popular boat. And worldly material makes a worldly church, right? And Holy Ghost material makes a Holy Ghost church. Ain't that right? Amen. We're not making the Holy Ghost church. It's just we're preaching the Holy Ghost word. Amen. And and the Holy Ghost is making a Holy Ghost church. Word on top of word, word on top of word, line by line, precept upon precept. Can you say amen? And the material cannot get mixed. Amen. You brother Brandon so hit against hybridization, hybrid. It cannot be mixed. That true Holy Ghost church cannot have just a little bit of the worldly material. Amen. Just as much as that worldly church will not have an ounce of Holy Ghost material in it. Amen. Worldly material is making a worldly church. Holy Ghost material is making a Holy Ghost church. Can you say amen? So they it's got to stay separated. Amen. In 1958 and and I've got a lot here so you bear with me. But in 1958 in his prayer speaks of the church in general saying it's lost its sweetness. It's lost its love. It's lost its influence to bring sinners to you. Just taking in a bunch of members and baptizing them and let them live in the world and their influence has corrupted the church. Can you say amen? See? Amen. And and we find the church is they're more out um uh uh they they don't see the separation anymore. And and what's sad, you know, the Bible talks about woe unto them that call evil good and good evil. It's sad that that type of spirit has come into the churches, amen, to the worldly church, amen, to where they they they have no standards. They they don't preach against anything. and and and to where they're allowing homosexuals and and uh transgenders and all of these things. Uh in now in in so he's speaking of the worldly church if if you say it that way in 1963 he speaks of the recent event where the moon was blacked out. Remember in shalom if you haven't listened to it you ought to go listen to it the message shalom. and and he uh uh he speaks of the recent event there in uh where the moon was blacked out by the earth and the earth had gotten between the sun and the moon and and you remember the moon is a reflection of the sun. It has no light of its own. It's just a reflection. And the earth in between the sun of of the light of the sun and and to where it caused the moon to become darkened. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? And brother Brand tells us there was a spiritual significance about this. A amen. And and uh the blackout of the moon, he says, represented this le oys church. if you wouldn't mind putting up that picture that I asked you about. Amen. Uh the blackout of the moon represented this lays in church. Brother Brandham also said the moon represents the church. The shadow of the world crosses the moon and the shadow of worldlyism. I say this again now. The moon represents the church. The shadow of the world crosses the moon. And the shadow of worldlyism, the shadow of worldliness, a worldly church has swept across to black out the entire light of the Bible. A ain't that amazing? The entire light. It wasn't partial light. It was in the entire light because the word had become opened. Ain't that right? And as the word became open to reveal Jesus Christ, amen. Then then we find, Amen. that God showed, amen, in the skies that that wordlyism, amen, had blacked out the entire light of the Bible, amen, to the church. He said the world got in the light of the reflection. Do you understand? The world crossed in the light of the moon and blinded out the sun. speaking of naturally. But remember, it was a type of it blocking out the light of the sun man. S O N light. Ain't that right? Remember it is the rising of the sun. Brother Brandham preached the sun has come up. It is light. It's a dual rising. And what a what a resurrection that was. What a resurrection this is. The light was shining in its full strength. And worldlyism blocked out the light. Ain't that right? Now the world crossed the in the light of the moon and blinded out the sun and the reflection of the moon that's supposed to be light to the earth. It was blacked out. Now there were six pictures, brother Brandham talks about six pictures in the newspaper of of the natural event. Amen. uh uh uh in at that time and and it went into national news and it showed six different stages of of the earth crossing the moon and each stage the moon was getting darker darker darker till it become a complete blackout. Now, before this time, before that happened in nature, brother Brandham had been teaching the the church ages. And he drawled that right there. That's what he draw. Uh uh and he was showing the phases of the moon, the church in every stage. Uh uh that middle was the dark ages. Amen. And and then you you find there uh so he was he drawled the seven phases of the church seven amen uh uh uh phases. Now he says I didn't know that one year and 6 months later God was going to vindicate it in the skies and slip it across the national papers. I didn't know. Now this is a prophet now. He was under inspiration as he's drawing that right. and and he he talks about it that when he drawled that uh uh he's got he's got it drawn out on the on the here. He said the the spirit of God went to the back wall and it began to show everyone that he just drawed on the wall right there. While he's talking here, he said the Holy Spirit went back and draw it right there on the wall and everybody's was watching it and looking at it. a year and 6 months or so later, God does it in the skies, in the heavens. And and so now a prophet is on earth. The world just looks at it as an eclipse or whatever, but a prophet now is showing the spiritual significance as to what was just happened. Ain't that right? And he's tying what happened out there in in the skies. Amen. was tied to to what he draw right there showing the people. Right? So he says now he says now on the papers you only get six ages. &gt;&gt; Six ages is because the leotan age was completely blacked out. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; God showed that the Leoysian age was completely blacked out. Amen. He said, "Now, if you'll notice the spiritual application as God said it in the heaven, when I sat here on earth, I left see a little teeny a little teeny bitty space uh as uh just a little teeny bit of light." See, that was just before the very elect was to be called from the earth. The reason I place it on there for the seventh age when God, he said, that's the reason I put it there. When God put it in the heavens, it was totally blacked out. Means maybe the last one is called from that Leodysian age. We don't know. So, he wasn't saying it was the last one called from that Leodysian age. He said, "We don't know." It could be. Ain't that right? But the significance of this is that the worldliness has got in the way of the s light in this leotan age till Leoan age sits in darkness. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? Now, if you notice in the masterpiece, the prophet says, uh, he, meaning God, is going to bring this little bride, that smitten, right back to the side of the original word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And there he is. There is the masterpiece, the family, back again in the Garden of Eden. How is this bride going to do this? How is this wheat going to do this? Malachi 4 said in the last days it would be restored back. What? Restored back like the beginning. Take it back. &gt;&gt; Not sitting in darkness &gt;&gt; but taking it back. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Leodysa is left without the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Leoa is left in darkness. Total blackout. But God is making a bride. Amen. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? See, restored back like it at the beginning. Take it back. I will restore, sayeth the Lord, all the years the palmer worm and the canker worm and all these other things has eaten. I will restore again. Notice he says, "And Malachi 4 is to bring back to the original." &gt;&gt; Without Malachi 4, you'd be sitting in darkness. Without my California, you'd be part of the Leoysian age. Amen. Don't take this message for for granted now. Amen. Don't take the messenger for granted. God gave us a messenger with a message. He and the his message are one. How many believes that? Amen. And so now notice Mal 4 is to bring back to the original. She, the bride, is smitten from the church, from the church body, smitten with her master for the same purpose. She is the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Just the same as Joseph was smitten from his brethren because he was the word. Jesus was smitten from his brethren because he was the word. The church or the bride is smitten from the church because she is the word. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? Amen. Another place, the word living and in action. The Bible bride. &gt;&gt; Not just any old bride. Not churches, churches, brides, brides. The Bible bride. The word bride. A ain't that right. They say, "Well, brother Brandon was out of scriptures and all that. You can't even, you know, and and all these things." That's a lie. &gt;&gt; He preached from these scriptures. It's just the problem is people are blinded. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? Amen. They don't know their Bible like they think they do. But a prophet would give us the true interpretation of this word to where we could become a Bible bride. Not some man-made bride, but the Bible bride, smitten and afflicted of God. No beauty we should desire her. But yet we did esteem her smitten and afflicted of God. That's right. She stands alone. She is smitten from all the denominations according to Revelations 3. She is smitten out of the Leoysa church age that she was raised up in. &gt;&gt; So we're not part of this leotan age. &gt;&gt; We have no dealings with this Leoysan age. In other words, the spirit of this leodysian age has no effect upon us because we've been smitten from that. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Amen. No. No. uh the teachings of Leoa does not affect us. &gt;&gt; The the the spirits of Leoa has no hold on us. &gt;&gt; It's the word and the word only. &gt;&gt; Amen. Aren't you glad for that? &gt;&gt; See, she stands alone like the bridegroom, rejected of man, despised and rejected of the churches. Amen. The bride stands that way. What is it? It's his masterpiece. It's the word that he can work through and make manifest. Another place, the stalk, the tossel and husk never become seed. No, but all the time. Amen. Uh become more like seed. See the stock, the tossel and hos never become seed. No, but all the time becoming more like the seed. Amen. Each phase, each stage is coming more and more until it got around the shuck and it looked like the seed. The prophet said the Pentecostals actually looked like the real thing, but it wasn't the real thing. Pentecostal age thought looked like the real moving of the spirit and all that, but it wasn't the real thing. Amen. Sure, they had a little spirit there and and all these things, but it wasn't what God was after. It wasn't bringing this church up to a ripening place. See, so now at the harvest time, the har, how many believes we're in the harvest time? We are in the harvest time. And he says the seed is back to its original life, back to the Bible, Bible life, Bible inspiration. Amen. See, Malachi 4 said it would be brought that way. Oh, must have all to be this way, it must have all of the word. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now notice this is not a Pentecostal age. He said this is the latter day age. This is the bright age. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? This is the evening light. We're another place. We're not living in a Pentecostal age. We're living in another age. We're not living in the messedith age. And and we're living in another age. We're living on up here to the bride age. He's showing that this bride has been smitten. Smitten from the churches. Smitten from that church age. Denominationational age. That's what the church ages were. Denominational ages. Ain't that right? Living up there were living on up here to the bride age. The calling out of the church and getting it together for the rapture. &gt;&gt; Another place you look at the calendar and find out what day of the year you're living in. And you look at God's Bible and see what age we're living in. We're not living in the Methodist age. the Baptist age. We're living in the bride age. The calling, bringing back to God through a channel that he promised to bring it back in. Well, what's the channel? Malachi 4, Revelations 10, Luke 17:30, Zechariah 4. Amen. The channels, there's promises that God left in this word to tell us how he would bring this bride back. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Come on now. Now the bride church, she's a holy se she's a separated unto the Lord. A holy people separated. &gt;&gt; This bride church is living in a total different atmosphere &gt;&gt; than what the leota church is living in. &gt;&gt; I'm I'm I'm thankful for the message of the hour. &gt;&gt; Amen. because I see that it's had an influence on me. I see that it's had an influence on you and and many around the world. But this is not to say that we don't have our struggles. Um and that we are without warfare. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; We have warfare. We have even more of a warfare being that we've got the message given to us. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; The warfare, this message is what's bringing a bride. And as we keep coming fighting, &gt;&gt; and Satan is trying his best to exert his influence over us. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? Amen. &gt;&gt; I I'll ask you, how many believe you're free? &gt;&gt; Believe you're free. &gt;&gt; Well, Satan again, he's even though we're free, even though he's still trying to bring exert an influence over us. So, the prophet taught us that we have to be careful. We have to be careful as to uh what influence we come under or hang around. &gt;&gt; One place he says don't follow the wrong influence. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? He ain't talking to the world. He's talking to the bride, talking to the church. And as we know the prophet taught us that every mortal human being is influenced uh you you're going to be influenced either by the wrong influence or the right. &gt;&gt; He says see the wrong gives an influence and the right gives an influence. &gt;&gt; And the devil by demonic spirits influences men on the earth. So, Satan is not without influence. &gt;&gt; Satan by demonic spirits influences men on the earth and the Holy Ghost influences his church. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; Notice how he says it. The devil by demonic spirits influences men on the earth, but the Holy Ghost influences his church. &gt;&gt; Be part of the church. That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He says, "Now, the the the sinner is influenced by a spirit because he has a spirit." And that's how we're all influences because we're spirit &gt;&gt; beings. &gt;&gt; The the the sinner is influenced by a spirit because he has a spirit. And those who are dominated uh uh with blackness and separation are dominated from the underworld of devils. All right. &gt;&gt; Now, we we know that, you know, like they say Billy Sunday when he would come to town, he'd shut up. He'd close the bars. I mean, he had such a ministry and and things and he would preach such conviction that it would actually close the bars and things in town. When brother Brandham come, he didn't really point out the spirits that are out there, but he pointed out that spirit that was in the church. &gt;&gt; That was a religious spirit. &gt;&gt; That's right. So when we think that he says, you know, those that are dominated with blackness and separation are dominated from the underworld of devils, we're thinking of people that got baseball bats that are hitting other people in the head and murdering and running from the law and drinking and drugs and sex and all these things. But there is a religious spirit too &gt;&gt; that comes from the underworld. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? Now, brother Brandham talking about the Pentecost, the saints at Pentecost, he said they were influenced by the word to the word. &gt;&gt; That 120 at Pentecost, they were influenced to the word. &gt;&gt; They weren't influenced to emotions. But when Peter stood up and they were asking, "What is this?" Peter took it right to the word and said this is that which was promised by the prophet Joel. Can you say amen? See their influence. Amen. Took him to the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. To fulfill the word &gt;&gt; for today. Amen. And he says and we should be under the same influence. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; We've got to be under the same influence. &gt;&gt; Amen. This message has got an influence. That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You can't be bride without influence. &gt;&gt; Can't come from sinner to saint without influence. &gt;&gt; Can't leave the things of the world and and and cleave to the things of God without the right influence. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; Amen. See, and so we find that it's an influence. Now, brother Brown talked about the pillar of fire that come down in Germany. He said the German church come to him and says you know we agree with your theology. We agree with everything that you're saying and all these things and and he said but they they said but that supernatural part &gt;&gt; we don't we don't understand. &gt;&gt; Amen. That that pillar of fire we just don't understand that. He says all of a sudden the pillar of fire dropped &gt;&gt; in that congregation and it dropped. And he says as soon as it come into that place the atmosphere changed. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? The atmosphere. And he says it's atmosphere. Men and women should live under that atmosphere. Don't get under some normal world existing influence but stay under the atmosphere of the Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? It's got to be an atmosphere that we live in in order for a rapture. [Music] &gt;&gt; You can't live in the atmosphere of honky tones. &gt;&gt; You live in the in the in under the influence of whiskey and tobacco. Amen. And lying and cursing and adultery and going in a rapture. &gt;&gt; There is an influence we've got to stay under. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? That's right. &gt;&gt; Now, Brother Bram says, "Now listen, anything." Any, everybody say anything. &gt;&gt; That means anything, right? &gt;&gt; Anything means all, right? &gt;&gt; All means all. Anything. All. All. Anything. Anything. Right? He says, "Anything that would keep the word from going forth with great power and influence today on our lives, take it away, Lord." &gt;&gt; How many wants that? Anything that would take the influence of the word from our lives taken away. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Any hindrance that we might have full access. Everybody say full access. &gt;&gt; Full access to the blessings promised to us through thy word. &gt;&gt; Amen. So we see that there are things that can keep the word from having an influence on us. &gt;&gt; We are to be word bride. We are to be clothed with that word. We are to come up rising higher and higher as the the prophet talked to that eagllet. Amen. There in the chicken pin. But he did the story didn't leave him in that chicken pin. Amen. The the the the story was he was trapped there. Amen. Not by his own will. It was somebody put him there. Ain't that right? He was trapped. He he he had no identity of who he was. He just knew he couldn't clock like the chicken. He couldn't eat the diet like the chicken. He couldn't pick at at at the others like a chicken and and do everything the chicken was doing. But when mama screamed up the voice from the heavens, amen, there was nothing there to block the the voice, the impact of the voice, amen, and the and the eagle, amen, be to hop and it hopped up on the fence and it hopped up on the barnyard and fin before you know it, it was up there soaring with mama. Can you say amen? Well, that's what this message is. It's the call of the eagle. We were trapped in the barnyard, but we couldn't fit. We took the drink, but we couldn't fit in with the world. We fought, but we just couldn't. We were so miserable. We might have taken the drugs and the prostitution and the adultery and all of that, but something just wasn't right. Amen. We might have sit in a church all of our life as I was in a Pentecostal church. Amen. I still wasn't happy. Amen. But I Oh, when I heard the eagle scream, Amen. There was something that been having an influence over me that nothing else could influence me like this message. &gt;&gt; It influenced. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; There are things that can keep the word from having an influence over us. Now, I'm going to get into what I got into last Sunday or the last time I spoke on this subject. One of the greatest influences in the world today is television. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; Amen. Television. Now, here's what Brother Brandon said. He said, "We rent from a woman that has the television in her house." I never intend to have one in my house. &gt;&gt; No, sir. I don't want that thing in my house. I would blow it out with my shotgun. I don't want nothing to do with that evil thing. &gt;&gt; Let me tell you about you Arizonans here. You seen that analysis the other day of schools, didn't you? 80% of the children in Arizona schools are suffering with mental deficiency by looking was by looking at television. &gt;&gt; Now we it's it's becoming prominent uh in this age this time everybody's talking about mental mental mental breakdown mental deficiencies. Everybody's mental. Not everybody, but most you think everybody was right. Amen. Mental. Mental. But brother Brown, here's a prophet now describing or telling it was by television. &gt;&gt; He said, "See, how about that? You better use your shotgun." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, some message people don't have shotguns. They need to go buy them one. Now, don't let the devil don't let the devil spray you with that. &gt;&gt; Another place, we don't have television. There won't be one in my home. Never. &gt;&gt; He said, "You want them? That's up to you." But God told me not to do it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Now, Psalms 101 and two, David says, "I will behave myself wisely in a perfect way. Oh, when will thou come unto me? I will walk within my house with a perfect heart. &gt;&gt; I will set no wicked thing before my eyes. I hate the work of them that turn aside. It shall not cleave to me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, I want to list maybe some of the things that we, you know, if you're watching movies, if you're television, all that, there's there's so many things. Do you realize first of all, our children would not be introduced to murder. &gt;&gt; That's right. sex, adultery, &gt;&gt; cussing, &gt;&gt; blasphemies, &gt;&gt; drinking, smoking, um what they they wouldn't be introduced to that if we put didn't have a television, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Most most young people are introduced to it at a young age and they would have never seen any most of that in their life. Rapes Amen. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, so most of these things you'll see in a movie programs or whatever in most movies, the breaking of God's commandments, &gt;&gt; that's right. &gt;&gt; Flaunted immorality. &gt;&gt; Casual drinking. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Did you know even the prophet says you don't have he didn't even he didn't preach all all about alcoholism or being an alcoholic. He preached about taking social drinks. &gt;&gt; Sure. casual drinking, the drug usage, &gt;&gt; drunkenness portrayed as humorous. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Sexual alluring fashions, &gt;&gt; sexually enticing dancing, &gt;&gt; violence and and may mockery things of God, &gt;&gt; mockery of God's people. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Pagan religions depicted as the truth. Yeah. Amen. &gt;&gt; You're not see hearing this taught in church. You're hearing it taught in movies. &gt;&gt; Sure. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Sensual situational ethics, occultism, paganism, humanism, evolution and new age era and and error or uh era or whatever. But uh uh and that's even in the cartoons and Disney movies and and all of that. And and somehow these young adults, young couples thinks that cartoons are okay. &gt;&gt; Come on. Come on. &gt;&gt; I don't get it. &gt;&gt; Now, I read some of the following the last Sunday and I'm going to speak uh when I spoke on this subject and I'm going to go ahead and read it because some of you wasn't present and some probably listening online. Well, you didn't get to hear it because we were read doing it at the library. &gt;&gt; And so I want to read it again, but this is what the secular world is saying. &gt;&gt; It says, one writer said, "Time and time again, cinema is mindlessly dismissed as escapism. While films are predominantly created for entertainment purposes, it would be a mistake to reject their world changing potential." Yeah, &gt;&gt; movies can have an impact far greater than first imagined. They can influence culture, politics, laws, and more importantly, they can change the course of history. As Saudi Arabia's first female producer perfectly stated, art, meaning movies, can touch people and make them open up. So, it's making people open up to what? Devils. &gt;&gt; That's exactly what it is. making their minds just go uh lame or or or uh limber or relaxed. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; One writer said movies can shape social trends and influence public behavior. For example, fashion in movies often sparks real world trends. 1961, one movie made Audrey Hepern's little black dress a fashion staple. Movies can influence language, popularizing slang or catchphrases that enter everyday conversations. &gt;&gt; Uh beyond cultural and social impact, movies have a direct influence on individual behaviors, attitudes, and decision making. &gt;&gt; Yes, &gt;&gt; movies can inspire. I say they do inspire. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. can inspire people affect can inspire people affect their emotional state or alter their views on certain issues. Political movies can sway public opinion on controversial topics. Research has shown that movies can influence behavior by normalizing certain actions. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Is that not where we're at? It started with television, with movies, &gt;&gt; and and they they normalized the actions. They normalized revenge. They normalized hate. They normalized broken homes. &gt;&gt; That's right. That's right. &gt;&gt; They normalize women taking the role of men. &gt;&gt; They normalized it. They normalized it to where if the wife is the is the homemaker and she stays home taking care of her husband and children, she's outdated and she's in bondage and she's just being abused and misused. They normalize this stuff. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; So he says, you know, for example, movies that glamorize smoking, drinking, drugs, or violence can unintentionally promote these behaviors. I say intentionally, at least if they don't realize it, the devil knows exactly what he's doing. Because you remember what the prophet said, "It used to be wrong to go to the movie shows, but Satan snuck a good one on us and put it in our house." &gt;&gt; Can an unintentionally promote these behaviors among impressionable viewers. One writer says movies can have a negative influence on society by exposing young people to harmful behaviors and attitudes. For example, movies may encourage the adoption of clothing styles, dietary habits. You know, used to it used to be just common meals, &gt;&gt; common things. Now, we've got to have what what I I wished I had words that I could use the koviar or whatever that would be. &gt;&gt; And you know the special things. I was telling someone the other day, pig slop now we call that casserose out. I like casserose. I just thought it was funny. You can laugh. It was an intentional hurt. I love your casseros. There you go. I'm running for office. So, we we see that that it's influenced and and they say the influence comes from television. &gt;&gt; People aren't happy with just regular meals. That's right. &gt;&gt; We got to hire the now, you know. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; So, so it goes on. Movies may encourage the adoption of closed dietary habits, &gt;&gt; cultural elements that deviate from societal norms, potentially leading to a loss of cultural integrity. Movies featuring dangerous stunts or violent content can inspire reckless behavior among youth, &gt;&gt; endangering their lives. &gt;&gt; The portrayal of substance abuse in movies can also lead teenagers to experiment with drugs, alcohol, tobacco, believing it enhances their social image. &gt;&gt; Movies can challenge faith and guide impressional mind. impressionable minds down morally ambiguous paths, disrupting their ethical comp compass. Exposure to violence and bloodshed in movies can desensitize young minds. I say young minds of all ages. Fostering an inclination towards extremism and antisocial behavior. Are we not seeing that? Yeah. &gt;&gt; Oh wow. So this influence goes on extends to lifestyle choices where the emulation of actors who indulge in substance abuse on screen can lead to teenagers to experiment with drugs, alcohol, tobacco. It also leads them to experiment in premarital sex when they see the actors doing insex acts. The psych psychological impact of movies is significant in that people are exposed to a wide range of emotions in a short span. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Which can have serious repercussions on their attitude in life. &gt;&gt; Movies can make you laugh, cry, hurt, &gt;&gt; anguish, sorrowful. It has control over your emotions. &gt;&gt; And you could have do all that within two hours of a movie. &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; Children and youth become desensitized to crimes leading to ins insensitivity towards criminal activity. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Movies also create unrealistic expectations about life and relationships. &gt;&gt; Affecting viewers perceptions of how life should unfold. &gt;&gt; Another writer says, "Whether it is that slick action thriller or the cheesy romantic comedy, chances are the movies you watch influence you." &gt;&gt; That's right. Movies play a salient part in our lives. When we want to escape the stress and and constraints of daily life, we turn to this art form. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Now, people turn to their phones. Right. &gt;&gt; Sure. &gt;&gt; And the combine the combined use of stunning visuals and captivating sound helps transport us to another realm and creates an immersive experience. Despite the role it plays, we often reduce it to be a mere source of entertainment. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; They call this, as we said last time, the mirroring rule, which refers to our tendency to imitate the emotions of another individual. &gt;&gt; Mirroring others emotions explains how we experience desired emotions throughout the movie. The mirroring rule is illustrated by the fact that when we see a smiling face on the screen, our natural tendency is to also smile, which results in feelings of happiness. Similarly, when a sad situation arises in a movie, we not only mirror the character's emotions, but this mirroring also causes us to to feel the uh emotion that is associated with it. See, another says, "Studies have shown that when it comes to feelings, movies have the exceptional ability to elicit any desired emotion from the audience, &gt;&gt; especially when they use a captivating and compelling story line. &gt;&gt; Movies we watch, the movies we watch influence our behavior in various aspects. When we observe a character who resonates with us acting in a particular way, we as viewers might model that behavior in an effort to replicate the actor's characteristics. &gt;&gt; Is that right? Yeah. &gt;&gt; Says, for example, 2000 and a 2018 study showed that children who watched a Disney clip featuring Lightning McQueen from the movie Cars, adding another character on the screen exhibited similar helping behaviors toward their peers afterwards. Another movie encouraged audiences to change their eating and shopping habits such as increasing their consumption of healthy foods and and purchase of organic produce. &gt;&gt; So they know what they're doing, right? So studies over time over time have highlighted that watching violent movies can result in aggressive behaviors. Regardless of whether the viewer is a 5-year-old child or a full-g grown adult, we imitate the content we see. &gt;&gt; Movies show that reckless driving causes the viewer to imitate this. &gt;&gt; Think about it. &gt;&gt; Yes. Yes. Another this effect can occurs because we either identify with the characters or hold them in high regard as our role models. &gt;&gt; By identification, we mean the ability to put oneself in the character shoes or to empathize with them. In both of these situations, we begin to closely observe their behaviors and attempt to reproduce them in our own lives. We do this because we want to emulate the characteristics or traits of the character that we find alluring. Now, this is the problem is because we we find that they put a romance to things even about a marriage that that is not it's it's all it's fake. &gt;&gt; It's it's fantasy, &gt;&gt; right? Right. &gt;&gt; And then we want our wives to to emulate these things or we want our husbands to be like this. Well, you know, Gilbert was that way, you know, on Anna Green Gables. Well, ain't you like that? Well, you're not an movies that promote homosexuality tend to make people more acceptable towards this lifestyle. So, you understand even preachers that are preaching against homosexuals &gt;&gt; and that spirit of what they have to deal with in the congregation &gt;&gt; to where even the the preachers cave in. because they're being there's an influence coming in the church and it certainly ain't the gospel. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; And I'm not saying here I'm just saying churches darkly ought to see it. &gt;&gt; One writer says a sad movie will leave its viewers with feelings of sadness and heaviness. &gt;&gt; A horror movie leaves its viewers fearful and afraid. Now, they wouldn't have been that way &gt;&gt; if they would have just sat in their living room and talked with their wife or their children and drank coffee or &gt;&gt; diet coke. &gt;&gt; But because they opened their mind up, let an influence through in their home &gt;&gt; might have had a good day at work, good day shopping, good day whatever, and now they're filled with fear. because an influence came in that had no business being there. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Product placements in movies affect audienc's behavior. Whether it be the presence of a swanky car, delicious chocolate, &gt;&gt; or alcohol, &gt;&gt; a character may name drop name drop some big big name brand throughout the course of the movie. This not only helps draw attention and increase brand awareness but ultimately impacts consumer behavior towards purging products. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? So Satan has been able through movies Hollywood been able to bring all kinds of influences into the home to where he can both he can control both parent and child. He also does it to control the family &gt;&gt; structure and the marriage. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; One writer said, "Seldom do we reflect on the power that movies have in shaping how we feel, think and act." [Music] &gt;&gt; One writer says, "Mov exert a trend a tremendous effect on people's psychology. People are exposed to all kinds of emotions within a short span of two or three hours. Love, hatred, vengeance, rape, savage violence, adultery, and many other undesirable activi activities are shown within such a short period of time. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? So, as I said, if it wasn't for Hollywood, people would not have had occasions to experience real this these things in real life, but movies have brought it in to where they can experience and feel and feel, not just sitting there watching something. But remember, brother Brown said, "The eye is the gate to the soul." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It it it works up the emotion. It works up the it it steers maybe shouldn't have been there or wouldn't have been there if you hadn't have seen &gt;&gt; such atrocities. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? Amen. &gt;&gt; So, so here we we find that one one writer said such scenes as rape, murder, vengeance, yada yada, are shown to everyone without any hesitation or restriction in the name of what people call the people of Hollywood calls entertainment. Entertainment, right? Keep that in mind. Entertainment. It's becomes entertainment to us. Never mind the fact of all the things that we just saw, everything, all the emotions we just felt. &gt;&gt; And the things that leave us or or stay with us after the movie is over. &gt;&gt; Now, we find that the people of this age are exhibiting the same behavior patterns and characteristics as the maniac at Geria. This man was so perfectly under the influence of the devil, he cut himself. Are we not in an age where young people are cutting themselves? &gt;&gt; They are. &gt;&gt; I never saw that in my age. Did Did you elders? Did y'all see that in your age? &gt;&gt; Did y'all see that in your age? Y'all didn't see cutting yourselves and all of that. I never saw that in my age. It hurt. But in this age, we've got children cutting themselves. Now, a prophet was in the 50s screaming out these things against television. Now, we're in an age and and they're they're they're they're actually exhibiting the same characteristics as the man at Gadie. He cut himself. When they bound him with chains, he would break the power of those chains. He attacked everybody that come along. &gt;&gt; He lived out in the graveyard and the devil stripped him naked. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham in a prayer he said this. He said, "I can remember back in the early days of my boyhood how that night I was hungering and I felt you knock at my door. I'm so glad I let you in. Now I'm a middle-aged man. I just love you more than I ever loved you in my life. Oh God, never let nothing happen. If I can't serve you, take me now. Let me go now. What a joy it is and a privilege uh to serve God. Give it to these young people, Lord. They got an awful battle. Look at them. Look at what they got. Look at their television. Rotten and polluted. So here's a prophet. He he he knows what's h he could see down the road what's going to take place &gt;&gt; and he knows that these children are going to grow up to be next generation and he's praying for them. God give it to these young people. Let them have a joy and a privilege of serving God. &gt;&gt; They got an awful battle. Look at them. Look what they got. Look at their television. Rotten and polluted. Look at the nation. They're coming up in here. See, politics rotten to the core. The antichrist arising and seating power. The world, American people don't know what a struggle is. They don't know uh how to do without. They never had to miss a meal. Oh god, just look. Glamour and Hollywood. And it's eventually got into assemblyline religion in the churches and streamlined Hollywood. No more old-fashioned all night prayer meetings and agonizing and praying and having fellowship around the things of God. No more praying through God. These children need that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm going to continue on for just a few more moments. Brother Brandman place says there's one there's only 1% of Russia that's communism. 1% but they're the controlling percent. And he says in 1% of Russia rather they control. And the same thing Hollywood's only one place but they're in control. Another place he says the world through television, through radio, through picture shows and those outlets there has corrupted this nation with the Tommy rod of Hollywood. &gt;&gt; And I'll tell you what what a prophet told the young people. He said, "Listen, young man, young lady, just as soon as you get out from under the Christian influence, you're in bad hands. You're on your road right then. Your road back right then." Remember that. Just as soon as you get uh from under the influence of the Holy Spirit, I don't care who the boy is or the or who the girl is, if they're not saved, keep away from them. &gt;&gt; Why? It's influence. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I ain't going to keep you much longer. But notice now what a writer said. and and he says, "Now, television has profoundly impacted American society and culture since its widespread adoption in the 1950s, influencing politics, consumer behavior, social norms, and family life. By the 1950s, most American households owned a television, fundamentally altering how people spent their free time and how businesses marketed products. The rise of TV advertising played a crucial role in promoting consumerism with studies showing that television access during the post-war era led to increased retail sales particularly in durable goods like automobiles aligning with the theories of cons uh conspicuous consumption. This shift helped embed a na national ethus uh of consumption into the American dream which was further popularized by sitcoms depicting idealized idolized suburban family life. &gt;&gt; Television also transformed the political landscape. The 1960 presidential debates between John F. Kennedy and Richardson were the first to be televised, highlighting the medium's power in shaping public perception. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; We go on down. Major historical events were brought into the living rooms through live broadcast, uniting the nation during moments of triumph and tragedy. Americans watched Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s years. I have a dream speech in 1963, the assassination of President Kennedy, Neil Armstrong's moon landing in 1969, creating shared national experiences. So, socially, television both reflected and shaped attitudes on race, gender, and class. Initially, programming under uh represented uh uh minorities and reinforced stereotypes, but civil rights movement coverage helped shift public opinion toward equality. So one writer says TV is a constant presence in most Americans life with its fastm moving visually interesting highly entertaining style. It compa it commands many people's attention for several hours each day. Studies have shown that television competes with other sources of human interaction such as family, friends, church, and school in helping young people develop values and form ideas about the world around them. It also influences uh a viewers attitudes and beliefs about themselves as well as about people from other social, ethnic and and cultural uh backgrounds. So it says between the 1940s and 2000 commercial television had a profound and wide-ranging impact on American society and culture. It influenced the way the people thought about such important social issues as race, gender, and class. Right? &gt;&gt; It played an important role in the political process particularly in shaping national election campaigns. On and on and on. So we we see. But the other day I did a a a comparison of what home life was like back in the 50s to what it is today. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. &gt;&gt; And I'd like to read some of these things to you and I promise you I'll let you go. But it says women in the 1950s and and this will probably be a little bit um uh controversial uh to maybe to someone watching or some of you youngans or whatever. Hopefully not you elders, but uh you youngans, but we we'll we'll read it. uh and and this is just from what people have said about the change and the studies and all that. &gt;&gt; Women in the 1950s were often defined by so societal expectations that centered on the role of the homemaker and mother with most married women staying at home and to raise children and manage the household while men were considered the primary bread winners and heads of the family. Right. Another writer says, "In the in the 1950s, the do the the dominant societal expectation for women in the United States was to be a homemaker mother with her primary primary role centered on the domestic sphere. This ideal was heavily promoted through media, advertising, government propaganda, which portrayed the nuclear family as the cornerstone of American society and a symbol of superiority over communism. Women were often expected to marry young, have large families, and prioritize their husbands and children's needs above their own. Right. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Gender, another gender roles in the United States have undergone significant transformation from the 1950s to today, shifting from rigid traditional expectations to a more fluid and diverse range of roles. In the 1950s, the ideal family structure was the nuclear family, consisting of a white middleclass working father, a stay-at-home mother with their children, with women expected to prioritize uh domestic duties and motherhood. Women were often pressured to leave the workforce after World War II despite having filled critical roles during and were largely uh confined to jobs like secretaries, nurses, uh teachers, often learning less than men or earning less than men. The societal expectation was for women to marry young, remain virgins until married. the focus on being and focus on being a homemaker while men were seen as the primary breadwinners and protectors. Today these roles have evolved considerably considerably. Women now make up nearly half of the US workforce a significant increase from less than onethird in 1950 and are more likely to hold advanced degrees than men. Women have gained greater control over their lives, including reproductive choices through the use of contraception, which began to grow in the 1950s and was later FDA approved. This autonomy uh was has allowed women to pursue careers, personal goals beyond traditional domestic roles. Men, meanwhile, are increasingly involved in child care, household responsibilities, with some choosing to be stay-at-home parents, reflecting a more shared approach to family life. What a change, eh? &gt;&gt; Women have come a long ways. One writer says, "Women have come a long ways in the last 50 years. Today women are getting married later, giving birth later in life and they make up 50% of the workforce and also have tremendously shifted the roles in family. There have been dramatic changes in how men and women look at their lives and what they're doing. Uh Barnett's lecture women's journal journey uh toward equality where we are and the path ahead discussed how traditional gender roles have changed. sub uh sub uh subsequently uh freeing women to engage in life outside the home. Women's lives are today are dramatically different from those of their mothers and grandmothers. Women are making choices that will prepare them for longer lives. A a significant labor force participation with marriage and children knowing that they are contributing to their own economic well-being. getting more education and proving themselves in well-paying employment. On the same note, men's roles have also changed. She said men having more responsibilities in the home and in caring for the children and the majority of men now rank having free time with family as one of the most important factors choosing their employment. Now, there was a TV show in the 1950s that had a great impact upon the home life in America. How many knows what that was? &gt;&gt; I love Susy. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Now, someone just told me uh I was in a or not Africa uh uh Alaska and someone said that they were talking I think to to one of the children Brandham children and they asked him why did brother Brandham always call it I love Susy or I love whatever. He never would call it I love Lucy and said did he really not remember that? He goes all he knew it. He said he refused to say it. So he would say, "I love Susy. I love this." But here's what they say. The show I Love Lucy significantly impacted perceptions of home life &gt;&gt; by challenging the idealized image of the 1950s housewife. Unlike the happy homemakers portrayed on other shows, Lucy Ricardo was depicted as a restless, ambitious woman who frequently rebelled against the confines of domestic life, seeking fulfillment beyond cooking and house work. Her attempts to enter the public sphere through jobs, performances, or schemes highlighted the absurd restrictions placed on women. Notice absurd restrictions placed on women in a male dominated society, &gt;&gt; making her character a symbol of the era's shifting social dynamics. The show's portrayal of Lucy's pregnancy and the birth of her son, Little Ricky, was a groundbreaking moment that blurred the lines between her onscreen persona and Lucille Ball's real life experience. this event uh broadcast the her ha actually her having a child was broadcast live uh and so I'm sure they didn't show everything but they did but this event broadcast live to an estimated 44 million viewers 44 million uh was a occasion that resonated deeply with audiences, transforming their private act of childbirth into a public celebration. The episode Lucy Goes to the Hospital became a cultural milestone reflecting changing attitudes toward motherhood and family life. Furthermore, the show's depiction of the Ricardo's evolving family life from living in New York City to eventually moving to a country home in Connecticut mirrored the suburban migration of many f American families during the post-war era. By showcasing a dynamic where the wife's ambition often clashed with her domestic role, I Love Lucy offered a nuisent nuisanced if ultimately conservative narrative about home life where Lucy's rebellions were usually thwarted and she returned to her domestic duties by the next episode. One writer said, "On the surface, Lucy Ricardo didn't fit the societal norms of the day." As Betty Freriedman wrote in her 1963 classic, The Feminine Mystic, "The American Housewife was healthy, beautiful, educated, concerned only about her husband, her children, her home. Happy homemakers could be found on every network from the patient mom uh Margaret Anderson of Father Knows Best to the profoundly agreeable June Clever of Leave it to Beaver. Instead, on I Love Lucy, Lucy was a hot mess. There was something comforting and even liberating about her inability to control her urges. She and Ricky became America's favorite TV husband and wife. Starting from the first season, Lucy performed a wide range of routines that effortlessly balanced comedy with sentiment and questioned the roles of men and women. &gt;&gt; "There is no doubt that Lucille Ball created a whole new audience for watching television," said actress Carol Bernett. "She took you on some kind of wild journey over those 22 minutes, and you could not wait to see what else she was cooking up." Americans turned in droves. Within 6 months, the audience reached 11 million with I Love Lucy attracting 67 of every hundred 9:00 movie night viewers. &gt;&gt; That year, I Love Lucy was nominated for an Emmy award for the best comedy show. And on May 26, 1952, Lucy graced the cover of Time with the headline, Lucille Ball, RX for TV, a clown with glamour. So we see brother Brandham in 1959, brother Brandham said there just seems to be something wrong somewhere and people are reaching for something and can't find it. That's a pitiful condition to be in. &gt;&gt; They've looked everywhere to find something to make themselves an example. They're wanting an example to make. &gt;&gt; They've looked everywhere. We take the women of our days. They'll watch television until they see a certain movie star or she'll come out dressed in a certain way and all the women will want to dress like her or act like her, make her the example. &gt;&gt; Some pretty girls just in the bloom of life will try to pattern themselves and try to make some movie star an example that they should go by and finally they find themselves wound up in a cage of sin that they can't get out of. What a pity seeing them coming into the meeting, tears running down their cheeks, but they're hunting for something as the musicians come. Give you a little hope. Another article it says on Monday, October 15, 1951, Love Lucy made its debut on the CBS television network, which then consisted of a few big stations and 74 local affiliates. There was a consolid There was a solid competition on NBC in the same 900 PM time slot from Lights On a top 10 television version of the original radio classic Lucy. So the critics predicted it didn't stand a chance. The first episode to air preceded by the many uh Philip's cigarette commercials was tilted. The girls want to go to a nightclub. He said it's the it's the Mert's 18th wedding wedding wedding anniversary and Ethel wants to celebrate by to the cup going somewhere while Fred itches to attend the fights. An argument ensues, culminating with Ethal, Ethel, and Lucy informing Fred and Ricky they'll go clubbing. They'll go nightclubing without them with dates. Admitting to themselves that perhaps they were too hasty, the men decide to sneak into the Copa with dates of their own just to keep an eye on their wives. Ricky calls his friend Jenny Jones, a singer at the Starlight Roof, and ask her to arrange dates for Fred and himself. and Lucy ah very soon thereafter calls her uh to arrange dates for her and Ethel. When Jenny spills the boy's plans to Lucy, Lucy decides that she and Ethel will impersonate their husband's blind dates. Dressed as country bumpkins, Lucille and Ethel arrive at the Ricardo apartment after Ricky sings a course of uh Guada Jara, whatever, some funny hillbilly uh uh uh stick unfolds until Lucy gives herself away by reaching for some cigarettes hidden in a desk drawer. All is forgiven and the two couples kiss and makeup in the tag. men prevail and it's night at the fights for the anniversary celebration. So we find and I've got lot more here but I I don't want to waste spend most your time but we find that there had to be a a root something so funny. It's funny if you watch it, it seems so simple, but look where it's brought us to. &gt;&gt; Look where it's brought the nation. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; So, what I'm saying there's influences and church. We're going home. [Music] We got to stay separated from the influences of the world. Cuz remember the prophet tells us again Leosa is blacked out. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Her influence does not come from the sen. &gt;&gt; Hello. &gt;&gt; It ain't coming from the sen light. &gt;&gt; It's coming from the pits of hell. The powers of darkness &gt;&gt; that our influence must come from the sen &gt;&gt; light. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; No wonder brother Brandham cried out, get back to Pentecost. And he said that several times. He says the Virgin Mary was under the influence of the Holy Ghost staggering like somebody drunk. She she wasn't under all this other influence. Are you with me? She she kept herself and and and she come under the influence of the Holy Ghost. And what did the Holy Ghost do? It made her so drunk and and to where she just lost her her mind with the world and every brother Brown said, "You get drunk on the Holy Ghost, you you won't be bitter and and you won't be mad and and and and and you won't carry the grudges and you won't desire the world. You're just so lost in the presence of God." Brother Brandham says, "Once in the presence of God, you'll feel so little and no account." Paul realized that he was wrong and he fell to the ground under the influence and power. When he looked up and seen the God that he had been preaching against and thought he knowed and and seen that he was wrong, he fell from his feet to the ground because he was in the presence of God. Can you say amen? In the presence of God. Amen. See, he said that's the same way in another place. That's the same way that an unbeliever sinner is everlaid in the presence of almighty God under the influence of the Holy Ghost. He becomes a new creature. Right? Then his life becomes fruitful, fresh. Life comes in and he yields what he was supposed to be a son of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. [Music] &gt;&gt; One last quote. He says, "Let us let's let's let's let let's let let's let let's let let's let let's let let's let let's let let's let let's let let's let the Holy Spirit influence us to the word of God. &gt;&gt; Let's let God do the influence in our heart and not be influenced by others." &gt;&gt; Is that the way you want to be? &gt;&gt; That's certainly what I want to be. Amen. Church message has the fluence. &gt;&gt; It It'll influence your faith. It'll influence your love. It'll influence your joy. It it it it brings marriages together. It it brings families together. It it it it it'll bring the lost loved ones back. I believe that. &gt;&gt; I believe that. &gt;&gt; Hey, bless the Lord. Surround me, oh Lord. [Applause] Oh, surround me, oh Lord. Oh, surround me, oh Lord. And let your spirit fill this place. Sing it again. Oh surround. I want him to surround our whole. I want his presence to dwell in his home. I I want angels to come and feel welcome in my home. Influence my heart. Influence my thoughts. Oh, that's what we want. You husbands, when you're out at work and you're dealing with things and these spirits, come into that home. [Music] It's a sanctuary. The God dwells there cuz you made your home a sanct. You're not letting all these other influences come in. And while you're at work and the wife's on the television, children watching all this stuff, Satan raping their minds and taking the the power of the word away from them and destroying it. Oh, it's a sanctuary. Is that what you want, church? Oh, surround [Music] me. Bless the name of the Lord surround.
