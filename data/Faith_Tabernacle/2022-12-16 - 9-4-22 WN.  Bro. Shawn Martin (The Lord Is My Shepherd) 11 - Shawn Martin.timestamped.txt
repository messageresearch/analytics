[1:20] group of people that
[1:22] is being led by him
[1:24] and is is just giving their lives over
[1:29] to him
[1:30] and letting him have the preeminence and
[1:33] I'm so glad for that

[2:33] overlooked you
[2:34] everybody back there pointing and I'm
[2:37] like
[2:38] good to have you
[2:41] amen praise the Lord and
[2:45] also just to remind you about about our
[2:48] fall festival we're going to be having
[2:51] that on November the 6th and um we're
[2:55] going to be having it at Camp Christie
[2:58] and I'm thinking about even having
[3:00] service there cam Christie um having
[3:03] service that Sunday morning and then um
[3:06] just making a day out of it different
[3:10] ones
[3:11] from out of town have expressed their
[3:15] desire to to come and so uh but we're
[3:19] looking forward to a wonderful time I've
[3:22] asked brother Diego
[3:25] um
[3:26] I don't know his last name but uh he's
[3:28] from a pastor from Indiana
[3:31] to minister that day and so Lord willing
[3:35] brother Diego will be with us at that
[3:39] time to minister and so he's just a
[3:41] wonderful brother you all I know y'all
[3:44] would remember him because he's been
[3:46] coming the past couple times to our
[3:49] meetings and as sung I think both both
[3:52] times but uh just a good brother and got
[3:57] a good report among the uh
[4:00] the Believers and so we appreciate that
[4:04] also brother Andrew had just texted me
[4:07] down there asking me to greet the church
[4:09] and so I thought I guess we'll pass that
[4:12] along a man he's ministering there in
[4:16] Claremore Oklahoma at brother Bryce's
[4:19] this evening and so I'm just praying for
[4:23] him that they have a wonderful time
[4:25] in the Lord if you have your Bibles
[4:28] we're going to turn to the Book of
[4:30] Psalms the 23rd chapter
[4:32] and um
[4:36] we've been
[4:37] studying from this uh speaking on this
[4:40] chapter for a while
[4:42] and
[4:44] I pray that it's been a blessing to you
[4:48] and it's certainly I've enjoyed studying
[4:52] it
[4:53] but uh
[4:56] we can look at
[4:58] Psalms 23 and we'll start at the the
[5:02] first verse
[5:04] it says the Lord is my shepherd
[5:07] I shall not want
[5:10] he maketh me to lie down in Green
[5:13] Pastures he leadeth me beside the Still
[5:16] Waters
[5:18] he everybody say he restoreth my soul
[5:24] amen let's just bow our heads and talk
[5:28] to our Lord father
[5:31] truly it's our heart's desire
[5:35] that you would come and lead us
[5:38] and take us Lord
[5:41] we're no man can can take us
[5:44] that even a preacher can't take us
[5:46] there's no one Lord like you that could
[5:49] lead us and
[5:51] father we know that your leading is
[5:53] right it's truth it's
[5:55] and Lord ultimately you're leading us
[5:59] back to home
[6:01] or be no sin no sorrow
[6:04] and oh God I pray that you would just
[6:07] help us Lord
[6:09] anoint us tonight father give us your
[6:13] spirit let there be a liberty
[6:16] God not only for me to be able to speak
[6:19] but Lord that you would anoint your
[6:21] people
[6:22] Lord their hearts their ears to hear to
[6:26] understand
[6:28] Lord may you have the preeminence in
[6:30] this service father is our prayer
[6:33] father we realize that time is so short
[6:36] and we want to make it every second of
[6:39] Our Lives count
[6:41] we want to do it for you Lord we want to
[6:44] live for you we want to Lord whatever
[6:46] you would want us to do we want to do it
[6:49] Lord
[6:50] father we love you in Jesus Christ's
[6:53] name
[6:54] and the church says
[6:56] amen you can have your seeds
[7:02] tonight I want to to deal with the first
[7:06] part
[7:07] of this third verse he restoreth my soul
[7:12] and I believe that God is in the
[7:15] restoring business you believe that
[7:18] Amen in the restoring business and
[7:20] uh acts 321
[7:24] tells us that there is to be a time of
[7:27] refreshing
[7:29] and a a time of restoration of all
[7:33] things
[7:35] and both of these are to happen at the
[7:38] same time
[7:40] and Paul I believe he's the one that
[7:43] wrote it in Acts but says that both of
[7:47] these
[7:48] happens when he sends Jesus Christ
[7:52] uh and and we know that Jesus Christ has
[7:57] come
[7:58] not according to what the world
[8:01] the the main tradition the traditional
[8:05] thought uh but we believe that Christ
[8:08] has made his dissension according to
[8:12] Revelations
[8:14] um uh ten and one and first
[8:17] Thessalonians 4 16. we believe that he
[8:21] has come descended with the shout a
[8:24] voice of trump and and so uh I believe
[8:29] that we're in this time of refreshing
[8:32] a time of restoration a restitution of
[8:36] all things and this word I just looked
[8:39] up this word refreshing it's actually
[8:42] means a recovery of breath
[8:44] and uh the the Webster would put it a
[8:49] Reviving or stimulation amen and I
[8:53] thought that was fitting uh for the day
[8:56] that we're living in and uh but we we
[9:00] find that the prophet said the mystery
[9:03] that is made known to us
[9:06] in this day the mystery being made known
[9:10] to us
[9:11] um is we're going back home how many
[9:14] believes we're going back home
[9:16] we're going back home I I'm so looking
[9:19] forward to it a man and
[9:22] um uh he says we're going back home to
[9:25] to be restored back to the original Eden
[9:30] free from Death sickness sorrow shame
[9:34] going back with eternal life
[9:37] he said it's the kingdom being restored
[9:40] amen being restored and so we looked at
[9:44] this word restore it means to turn back
[9:48] to return to repair to bring back and
[9:52] brother Branham in speaking of the new
[9:55] Heaven and the new Earth he says uh uh
[9:59] there it'll never be blackened again
[10:02] when this new Earth is to come the devil
[10:06] will be bound Satan is still loose now
[10:09] he is the accuser but in the new Earth
[10:12] he will be bound and cast into the Lake
[10:15] of Fire in this Holy Fire and in this
[10:19] new Earth the skies will never be black
[10:21] again no that's from the curse he never
[10:24] be black again with angry clouds the
[10:28] winds will never blow across her again
[10:30] like that no she'll never tear up the
[10:34] trees and tear up the houses and turn
[10:36] over the things lightning him the Wrath
[10:39] will never Belch from Satan across there
[10:42] and kill a man walking down the road or
[10:46] burn up a building no no more see there
[10:49] will be no more typhoon sweep down or
[10:51] storms or tornadoes and tear up houses
[10:55] and kill little children and things uh
[10:58] see won't be there no more see trying to
[11:01] destroy it it won't be there for Satan
[11:03] is cast out
[11:05] what what a restoration that is and and
[11:09] remember this is the age that we're not
[11:12] just beginning of restoration not not
[11:15] Luther Wesley or Pentecost restoring
[11:18] gifts or restoring a little Doctrine but
[11:20] this is the restitution of all things
[11:23] amen and this is where we're standing uh
[11:27] uh uh tonight in this age amen and
[11:30] brother Branham says what it is it's a
[11:32] restored Eden has begun amen a restored
[11:37] Eden and and so then just thinking on
[11:40] this restoration David would say the
[11:43] Lord is my shepherd and and he goes on
[11:46] down and as we've just talked about
[11:48] through uh through the first and second
[11:51] verses but then he comes that third
[11:52] verse which I believe it all ties
[11:55] together and and says he restoreth my
[11:58] soul amen and I've just been looking at
[12:02] this and realizing what a statement that
[12:06] really is according to to what's to
[12:09] restore is to bring back to the former
[12:12] owner or to bring back to a former state
[12:16] of condition that once was and and and
[12:20] now isn't but yet it's going to be
[12:23] because he restores there's a
[12:25] restoration and if a claim is made on
[12:28] something to make that restoration you
[12:31] can enforce it to make it come back to
[12:34] its right place can you say man so this
[12:38] is the work of redemption restoration
[12:40] and Redemption goes hand in hand a man
[12:44] because to redeem something amen means
[12:48] that that subject of redemption has been
[12:51] removed it's it's gotten out of its
[12:54] place and uh uh from its original
[12:57] condition its original state its
[13:00] original place a man but redeeming is to
[13:03] bring it back ain't that right and man
[13:06] so so brother Branham says it means that
[13:09] it was taken from its real place ain't
[13:12] that right now I know I know we think
[13:14] this is real and and Life to us seems to
[13:18] be real but there's another life that is
[13:20] more real than this and our condition
[13:23] right now may seem to be real but
[13:26] actually there's a better condition that
[13:28] is more real than this do you believe
[13:31] that amen and and so God is restoring us
[13:35] back to the real place our real
[13:38] condition our our our our place now now
[13:41] notice uh because God knows where you
[13:44] belong do you believe that if he's going
[13:47] to redeem you he's he then he's the one
[13:49] that's got to know where you belong he's
[13:52] got to know a man where where your
[13:55] original condition should be ain't that
[13:58] rhyme amen see and you must everybody
[14:00] say I must I must be in that place
[14:03] that's right amen in not only does he
[14:07] know amen your original place and your
[14:10] original condition but in God's mind you
[14:14] must be in that place and I I just love
[14:17] that ain't that right amen now notice
[14:20] Jeremiah 10 and 12 he that he hath made
[14:24] the Earth by his power he hath establish
[14:27] the World by his wisdom and have
[14:31] stretched out the heavens by his
[14:34] discretion or by his understanding see
[14:38] so so God didn't just sling out the
[14:41] stars and the Stars just happen to stop
[14:44] you know where they stopped and maybe
[14:47] because there wasn't enough power behind
[14:49] it to thrust it out more whatever but I
[14:53] believe that God stopped every Star
[14:55] where they belong do you believe that
[14:57] amen and and so uh uh I I believe that
[15:01] God put a great thought in in each star
[15:05] him and and billions of stars just in
[15:09] our galaxy and and yet millions of light
[15:13] years apart and and yet the Bible says
[15:16] he calls every one of them by name and
[15:18] that he can measure them he can measure
[15:21] them with his hand amen and and so if
[15:24] God knows every Star by name amen
[15:27] because he purposefully put Pluto where
[15:31] it should be and he uh I guess that's a
[15:33] star if not it's a planet and my wife
[15:35] will correct me afterward but uh
[15:38] whatever them stars are and wherever
[15:40] them planets ought to be and and all
[15:43] these things God knew exactly where they
[15:46] should go ain't that right now uh uh
[15:50] Psalms 147 and 4 he telleth the number
[15:54] of stars so we can't count the stars but
[15:58] God can tell the number if you were to
[16:00] ask God and God would give you the
[16:02] answer he would tell you exactly not
[16:05] guesswork exactly how many stars there
[16:09] are and he calls them all by their names
[16:12] see so great is our Lord and of great
[16:16] power notice his understanding is
[16:19] infinite right that's what the Bible
[16:21] says his understanding is infinite and
[16:24] the prophet gives us just a little
[16:26] glimpse of what infinite is he says
[16:28] words can't describe what infinite is
[16:31] but he says if we could just go amen and
[16:34] and get a little understanding of what
[16:36] infinite is it would be God a billion
[16:39] billion billion years before time ever
[16:41] began he knew how many mosquitoes would
[16:45] be there how many gnats would be on the
[16:48] face of this Earth he would know the
[16:50] breath and the size of depth of breath
[16:52] and he would know every little heartbeat
[16:55] and every nap would make and he says and
[16:57] that doesn't even begin to describe what
[16:59] infinite is ain't that right and yet his
[17:03] understanding is infinite now so so so
[17:06] think of how god holds the Earth if one
[17:11] star would get out of its place amen
[17:14] then it would affect the entire Earth
[17:16] amen uh the whole solar system has to
[17:21] stay in its place ain't that right now
[17:24] uh Jeremiah 5 22 fear ye not me saith
[17:29] the Lord will you not tremble at my
[17:32] presence which have placed the sand for
[17:35] the bound of the sea uh by a Perpetual
[17:39] decree that it cannot pass
[17:42] amen though the waves thereof toss
[17:45] themselves now notice amen have you been
[17:47] to the beach and and you see the waves
[17:50] crashing against that ocean and or the
[17:52] beach and crashing in and even at night
[17:55] time you know how that the water may be
[17:58] you know way back over there but at
[18:00] night time it creeps up and it creeps up
[18:02] and everything that was Beach is now
[18:04] covered with water a amen but yet it's
[18:07] by a decree that it can't go any further
[18:10] ain't that right it's by a decree now I
[18:14] want you to understand that because if
[18:16] God would decree the Stars to stay in
[18:18] its place God would decree the moon and
[18:21] the sun to stay in its place and he
[18:24] would decree even the waves of the water
[18:27] Amen to stay in its place can you say
[18:30] amen and he says now he's placed the uh
[18:33] the sand for the bound of the Sea by
[18:35] Perpetual decree that it cannot pass and
[18:39] though the waves thereof toss themselves
[18:41] yet can they not Prevail nor though they
[18:47] Roar yet can they not pass over it ain't
[18:50] that right so so now let's look at it
[18:53] but what keeps the what keeps them from
[18:56] prevailing well we say well the word of
[18:58] God but look at the Moon amen the moon
[19:01] as we know controls the tides ain't that
[19:04] right if the Moon would get out of its
[19:07] place
[19:08] ain't that right if it just get out of
[19:11] its place just a little bit see the
[19:14] prophet said the Earth would be covered
[19:16] in water within a a few minutes ain't
[19:19] that right but they stay in their
[19:22] position because God decreed them to
[19:26] stay exactly where they are they're just
[19:28] hanging in space at the word of God oh
[19:33] my ain't that right now we're the ones
[19:36] that's been taken out of our position
[19:39] ain't that right amen we're the ones
[19:42] that's been taken out of our position
[19:44] now brother Branham says see if God when
[19:47] I was an alien from him so loved me till
[19:50] he stooped down to get me and pick me up
[19:54] then that gives me confidence that he
[19:57] wants to use me
[19:58] ain't that right amen if God would so
[20:02] love you that he would involve his time
[20:05] with you then that means he must want to
[20:07] do something with you
[20:09] amen God just ain't wasting time he he
[20:12] ain't just playing you know uh little uh
[20:15] patty cake with us ain't that right amen
[20:17] sometimes we become insincere about life
[20:20] and we become insincere about our
[20:22] salvation but I'm telling you God ain't
[20:24] insincere if God saved you he's got a
[20:27] reason for saving you ain't that right
[20:29] amen he knew your condition before you
[20:32] ever knew your condition he saw where
[20:34] you belong way before you ever amen we
[20:37] wouldn't even know where we belong had
[20:39] it not been for the mercy of God Amen
[20:42] for all of it we can know is that our
[20:44] life is just meant for here and we live
[20:46] we die amen and who knows where we end
[20:49] up amen but God will see to it amen that
[20:53] before we die there's a restoration that
[20:56] has taken place can you say amen amen
[20:59] see so uh uh he said he's got a purpose
[21:02] in doing it he's seen something in me
[21:05] he's seen something in you and he had a
[21:09] reason to save you ain't that right look
[21:12] at the people that's unsafe today look
[21:15] at the millions he could have took
[21:16] besides you but he took you my see no
[21:20] one everybody say no one no one can take
[21:24] your place
[21:25] no one can take your place ain't that
[21:27] right he's got that Moon hanging right
[21:30] there amen and we hear that there's
[21:32] other moons there's other Suns there's
[21:33] other stars there's all these in other
[21:35] planets but that Moon that you see every
[21:38] night there is not another Moon can take
[21:40] its place there ain't nothing else that
[21:43] can take its place can you say amen God
[21:46] ordained for that Moon that sun then
[21:49] Stars Amen to hang in our galaxy Amen to
[21:52] keep this world in order ain't that
[21:54] right well that's the same way God ain't
[21:57] replacing Sons and Daughters amen of his
[22:00] Emmanuel you've fallen and you've messed
[22:02] up and you're mad and and so I've got to
[22:05] go find something else that ain't
[22:06] Redemption can you say amen amen God
[22:09] angel redeeming this Earth amen or or
[22:12] replacing this Earth he's going to
[22:14] redeem this Earth he's not replacing
[22:16] anything it's all about Redemption ain't
[22:20] that right amen so he could have taken
[22:23] you or uh he could have took took beside
[22:26] you but he took you no one can take your
[22:29] place you're in God's economy
[22:33] aren't you glad you're in God's economy
[22:35] you're in God's economy and no one can
[22:39] do it that's his love to you
[22:42] now we we shouldn't take these things
[22:44] for granted we are in the economy of God
[22:50] that's right see so you have to be
[22:52] brought back to your original place your
[22:55] original condition because nobody can
[22:57] take your place
[22:59] so this is redemption redeemed Romans 8
[23:04] 19 for the earnest expectation of the
[23:08] creature Wade is for the manifestation
[23:09] of the sons of God for the creature was
[23:13] made subject to vanity amen not
[23:16] willingly but by reason of him who hath
[23:20] subjected the same and hope think of
[23:23] that he made you subject to vanity but
[23:26] before he'd done that he made you
[23:28] subject to a hope he had already
[23:31] provided a remedy for you
[23:33] amen say so because the creature itself
[23:37] shall also be delivered from the bondage
[23:40] of corruption into the Glorious Liberty
[23:44] of the children of God for we know that
[23:47] the whole creation growneth and
[23:50] travaileth in pain together until now
[23:53] and not only they but ourselves also
[23:56] which have the first fruits of the
[23:59] spirit even we ourselves groan amen have
[24:03] you just had that groaning in you we
[24:06] ourselves groan within ourselves waiting
[24:09] for the adoption to wit the Redemption
[24:12] of our body so there's a groaning and
[24:15] there's a travailing remember brother
[24:17] Branham he tells us he said it's just
[24:19] like a man that has fallen in a pit and
[24:22] he can't get out he's trying to get back
[24:25] to its original condition amen see and
[24:29] and so he says see uh uh they're
[24:32] struggling climbing appalling they must
[24:35] by some means get out of this pit
[24:37] they're not in their original state and
[24:39] frantically they're screaming they're
[24:41] clawing the walls and making a noise or
[24:44] doing some way they're groaning because
[24:46] that they want to get back to their
[24:49] original state have you just wondered
[24:51] what that desire is in you that hunger
[24:53] that is in you a man that is longing for
[24:56] a better world that's longing a man for
[24:59] a world where there's no death there's
[25:01] no trouble there's no sorrow and and
[25:04] maybe you don't understand or we didn't
[25:06] understand it but now we're beginning to
[25:08] understand what this is We Came From
[25:12] Another Place
[25:13] that's right scene and so he says
[25:16] they're groaning because they want to
[25:18] get back to their original state as when
[25:21] a person is struck with disease aches
[25:23] and pain one time they wasn't that way
[25:26] but they're groaning why they're not
[25:28] right there's something wrong amen
[25:31] they're groaning a man trying to get
[25:33] back to where they was when they had
[25:35] health and when Nature and people as the
[25:38] Bible says are groaning it shows there's
[25:41] something that they're not in their
[25:44] ought to be conditioned they have fallen
[25:47] from somewhere now we know that it's
[25:51] eternal life that we fell from ain't
[25:53] that right and we've lost our claims on
[25:56] eternal life by the fall of Adam and Eve
[25:59] they fell from eternal life in the
[26:02] Garden of Eden and by doing so they
[26:05] brought all nature amen down uh under
[26:09] them to death amen as the prophet would
[26:11] tell us a tree never died before Adam
[26:13] fell amen
[26:16] a child never died you know it it or an
[26:20] animal never died before Adam see amen
[26:23] and and there's only one thing that
[26:25] cannot die and that's God himself for he
[26:30] is eternal ain't that right amen and
[26:33] having eternal life is the only way that
[26:37] will keep us from dying amen and so then
[26:41] we must have eternal life within us to
[26:45] be Sons and Daughters of God can you say
[26:47] Amen that that's what God is looking for
[26:50] is Sons and Daughters amen not not Sons
[26:53] and Daughters of Duran Martin but Sons
[26:55] and Daughters of God Amen that that's
[26:58] right he wasn't looking for William
[27:00] Branham of Charles and ellebranum he was
[27:02] looking for a Son of God and so is it
[27:04] with you amen God is anticipating the
[27:08] sons of God Amen to come back to what
[27:11] their place is in his mind do you
[27:15] believe that that's right see amen so he
[27:19] says when we died to sin we sold out our
[27:21] Birthright and crossed this Chasm and
[27:24] we're beyond the reach of God on this
[27:26] other side of CAD the chasm now of
[27:28] course when Adam fell to death he
[27:30] brought death upon all creation that's
[27:32] right see amen so God had to come to us
[27:36] ain't that right as and and I know this
[27:40] was basic but I'm getting somewhere on
[27:42] this restoration of the Soul God had to
[27:45] come to us we didn't ask God to come to
[27:48] us how do we know that we need it we
[27:51] were born in sin shape and iniquity we
[27:53] thought this was all there was that God
[27:56] out of the out of the rims of of time
[27:59] and and having an infinite mind he he
[28:03] already had our lives figured out and it
[28:05] wasn't this to be Sinners and to be
[28:07] burdened down in sin and sickness and
[28:10] diseases and and all of that ain't that
[28:13] right so even we weren't asking for his
[28:16] pardon we weren't asking for his
[28:18] Redemption but he came to us the desire
[28:23] began on his part ain't that right so
[28:27] John 3 16 for God so loved the world
[28:31] that he gave his only begotten son that
[28:35] whosoever believeth in him should not
[28:37] perish but have everlasting life and
[28:41] notice for God's sin not his son into
[28:44] the world to condemn the world but that
[28:47] the world through him might be saved
[28:50] ain't that right and again as we said
[28:53] before Jesus did not come to this Earth
[28:56] come to this world hey shopping amen
[29:00] looking for something new he didn't come
[29:02] grocery shopping like or what we would
[29:04] call grocery shopping he didn't go like
[29:07] we would go to Walmart or Amen to uh uh
[29:10] uh Kmart or or the food Supply or
[29:14] whatever amen that's he came Amen to be
[29:18] a redeemer he didn't come to replace
[29:20] that which was Fallen can you say man
[29:23] amen he came to bring back that which
[29:27] was Fallen amen and and I'm glad that
[29:30] he's a Healer aren't you glad he's a
[29:32] Healer amen not only of our body but of
[29:34] our soul he come to fix the problem amen
[29:39] and restore us back Amen to where we
[29:43] belong amen Psalms 103 2 says bless the
[29:47] Lord O my soul and forget not his
[29:51] benefits not all his benefits and the
[29:55] fourth verse who redeemeth thy life from
[29:59] destruction
[30:00] amen aren't you glad for that redeemeth
[30:04] thy life from destruction I think of how
[30:08] that God spoke through the mouth of the
[30:10] Prophet Hosea saying I will ran handsome
[30:14] them amen with the from the power of the
[30:17] grave and I will redeem them from Death
[30:21] this is what God's speaking through a
[30:23] prophet Hosea and and not only is he
[30:25] talking about Israel he's talking about
[30:27] he had spiritual seed amen them Sons and
[30:30] Daughters of God the grave is held to
[30:33] him that I'm going to redeem them from
[30:35] the grave death strikes every one of
[30:37] them all good men down Through the Ages
[30:40] uh uh they've been good men but when
[30:42] death comes they have to give it up they
[30:45] give in and there they are it's in the
[30:46] grave but he says I'm going to redeem
[30:49] them from the grave or from Death can
[30:52] you say amen and I believe that that
[30:54] scripture is going to be fulfilled in
[30:56] this hour I believe there are people
[30:58] living on this Earth that'll never taste
[31:01] death
[31:03] I just believe that amen I believe
[31:05] there's some in this building that is
[31:07] never going to taste death amen never go
[31:10] by the way of the grave and that
[31:11] scripture is going to be fulfilled can
[31:13] you say amen amen that's right Galatians
[31:16] 3 13 Christ Christ has redeemed us from
[31:21] the curse of the law being made a curse
[31:24] for us Titus 2 14 Christ gave himself
[31:28] for us that he might redeem us from all
[31:32] iniquity think of that church all
[31:36] iniquity and purify unto himself a
[31:39] peculiar people zealous of Good Works
[31:43] amen now you think of the work of
[31:45] redemption not only redeeming you from
[31:48] the grave redeeming you from death he's
[31:50] redeeming you from all iniquity my Where
[31:55] Do We Stand now I want you to notice
[31:58] that Jesus is not constantly redeeming
[32:01] you come on he's not constantly
[32:04] redeeming me every day I wake up he's
[32:06] he's constantly redeeming that's not
[32:08] true can you say amen amen in other
[32:11] words we're not one day in the pawn shop
[32:13] and then another day we're out of the
[32:16] pawn shop and then the next day we're
[32:18] back in the pawn shop and then the other
[32:20] day we're out of the pawn shop it's not
[32:22] He Loves Me He Loves Me Not He Loves Me
[32:24] He Loves Me Not he loves me you
[32:26] understand what I'm saying that's not it
[32:28] see it's not a constant work of
[32:31] redemption no sir amen and I want you to
[32:35] understand that now it's not a constant
[32:37] work of redeeming amen Hebrews 9 12 by
[32:42] his own blood he entered in once into
[32:46] the holy Place having obtained Eternal
[32:50] Redemption for us
[32:53] God have mercy so he's not having to die
[32:56] for you every time you make a mistake
[32:58] he's not having to die for you every
[33:00] time a bad thought comes through your
[33:02] mind he's not having to die for you
[33:04] every time you stumble and and and you
[33:07] say something or you blow up and you
[33:09] lose your temper or or you lied or
[33:12] you've done this or you've done that no
[33:14] it's an eternal Redemption
[33:16] God have mercy it's a security can you
[33:19] say amen that's right see Hebrews 10 14
[33:23] for by one offering not many offerings
[33:27] but by one offering he hath perfected
[33:31] forever them that are Sanctified amen do
[33:35] you think of that now two thousand years
[33:37] ago by that offering he perfected you
[33:40] before you ever breathe your first
[33:42] breath in a world that is filthy in a
[33:46] world that's a turmoil in the darkest
[33:48] age the most evil age there is a people
[33:51] that stands perfected not by their own
[33:55] works but by the works of Calvary I'm
[33:57] telling you this Redemption is is
[34:00] settled
[34:01] it's an eternal Redemption
[34:06] can you say Amen you may have fallen
[34:08] today but you're redeemed you may have
[34:11] complexes that you're dealing with but
[34:13] you're redeemed can you say man you may
[34:16] have some growing up to do but you're
[34:19] redeemed you may have to repent but
[34:21] you're redeemed can you say amen and to
[34:25] think of it it wasn't redeemed when I
[34:27] come to the altar I was redeemed when he
[34:30] said it is finished
[34:33] he's the one said it's finished it's
[34:35] over and he put a period to my
[34:38] Redemption
[34:41] he's the only one that could put a
[34:42] period to our Redemption
[34:45] can you say Amen why it's a perfect
[34:48] blood
[34:51] bringing forth a perfect loosening
[34:55] can you say amen that's right see so
[34:58] David is saying he restoreths my soul
[35:01] it's an eternal restoration
[35:04] foreign
[35:05] [Applause]
[35:09] to rest in Green Pastures and we know
[35:12] what that is that's that open book
[35:14] he's eating from the open book can you
[35:18] say amen amen and to think of it that is
[35:21] the book of redemption that's what's
[35:23] been restored to us in this day it's not
[35:26] coming from a clergy not coming from a d
[35:29] a a headquarter somewhere it's coming
[35:32] from the straight Mind Of God Amen it's
[35:35] the original thought that God thought of
[35:37] you and he's speaking it unto you and
[35:40] we're feeding and we're resting
[35:45] it's a place of rest
[35:48] how can a man enter and duress knowing
[35:54] that it could be restored today and lost
[35:55] tomorrow
[35:57] can't rest
[35:59] but David's saying he makes me lay down
[36:01] in Green Pastures
[36:03] he leads me by Still Waters it's a
[36:05] Waters of rest
[36:07] it's it's rest time
[36:09] oh I hope you understand that church
[36:11] notice Hebrews 4 and 3 for we which have
[36:15] believed do enter into rest as he said
[36:19] now don't create your own rest he's
[36:22] already provided the rest and those that
[36:25] believe in that rest will enter into
[36:28] that rest ain't that right amen so we
[36:31] which uh uh have believed to enter into
[36:34] rest as he said as I have sworn in my
[36:37] wrath if they shall enter into my rest
[36:40] although the works were finished from
[36:42] the foundation of the world for he spake
[36:44] in a certain place of the seventh day on
[36:47] this wise and God did rest everybody say
[36:50] God did rest the seventh day from all of
[36:54] his works
[36:55] oh my
[36:58] God where are we at
[37:00] where are we at in time where are we at
[37:02] in the church ages the church ages are
[37:03] finished
[37:04] we've entered into an arrest
[37:07] can you say Amen
[37:09] so look when the prophet said when God
[37:11] made the world in six days he rested on
[37:14] the seventh day
[37:15] never worked anymore
[37:18] blessed be the name of the Lord he built
[37:21] the world put the creation on it and
[37:24] went to rest and never everybody say
[37:26] never that's important he never came
[37:30] back again to build any more world he
[37:33] finished the works and went to rest
[37:36] can you say Amen but now he's not only
[37:40] got his arrest but he's providing his
[37:42] own people a rest
[37:44] to where they ain't going to have to
[37:46] labor anymore
[37:48] ninth verse there there remaineth
[37:51] therefore a rest to the people of God
[37:54] for he that is entered into his rest he
[37:58] also have ceased from his own works
[38:03] oh if we can get that now see as God did
[38:07] from his he ceased from his own works as
[38:11] God did from his
[38:13] my goodness amen isn't that amazing now
[38:17] the prophet said what that rest is you
[38:19] don't want it you you no more want the
[38:21] things of the world the world is dead to
[38:24] you
[38:25] can you say man the world is dead to you
[38:28] amen that's right now that ain't saying
[38:30] you ain't gonna make a mistake that your
[38:32] Prophet said you're subject to to fall
[38:35] you're subject to mistakes but he said
[38:37] the moment you realize that you're wrong
[38:39] you you'll repent of it and you get back
[38:41] up that's not held against you
[38:45] can you say Amen it's not held against
[38:48] you
[38:49] now Matthew 11 28 come unto me this is
[38:53] Jesus speaking to all his his Believers
[38:56] his children come unto me all ye that
[38:59] labor and are heavy laden and I will
[39:02] give you what rest now church this is
[39:06] God's so desire is that you come to rest
[39:09] come to rest in your salvation come to
[39:11] rest in your joy come to rest in your
[39:14] peace come to rest in all that you are
[39:16] you come to rest because God himself
[39:19] provided the rest you couldn't save
[39:22] yourself but God did you couldn't help
[39:25] yourself but God did amen you couldn't
[39:27] make deliver yourself but God did and
[39:30] it's an eternal Redemption
[39:33] ain't that right give your rest take my
[39:36] yoke upon you and learn of me for I am
[39:40] meek and lowly in heart and you shall
[39:43] find rest for what
[39:45] your souls
[39:48] this body gonna labor this body gets
[39:51] tired this body gets weary this body
[39:54] gets broken down but we're talking about
[39:56] he restoreth my soul
[39:59] you find rest for your soul can you say
[40:02] man and what is the rest the Holy Ghost
[40:05] you'll not find rest until you get the
[40:08] Holy Ghost
[40:10] can you say Amen Prophet said when did
[40:13] the rest come he said when people spoke
[40:16] with other tongues and had stammering
[40:18] lips stammering lips they didn't speak
[40:20] nothing they stammered see when when did
[40:23] that happen on the day of Pentecost when
[40:26] the Holy Ghost come that is the rest the
[40:28] Holy Ghost Jesus said come unto me all
[40:31] you that are weary and heavy laden and I
[40:33] will give you rest I'll give you life
[40:38] eternal life isn't that where we fell
[40:40] from but he says I'm going to impart it
[40:42] to you see Zoe God's own life God will
[40:46] come unto you and be a part of you
[40:49] he will give you a birth and make you a
[40:52] son and daughter ain't that right then
[40:56] you look at Ephesians 4 30. Paul says
[40:59] and grieved not the Holy Spirit whereby
[41:02] you're sealed to the day of your
[41:05] Redemption
[41:07] ain't that right what what in it you're
[41:10] sealed everybody say I'm sealed you got
[41:13] the baptism of God's spirit you're
[41:15] sealed not until the next Revival but
[41:18] until the day of redemption it's
[41:21] finished it's over you've come into rest
[41:25] and brother Brown said the greatest
[41:28] curse that is upon is on the church
[41:30] today is they don't know who they are
[41:37] it's true
[41:39] I I think it behooves us to see just how
[41:43] secure the restoration of our souls is
[41:49] for there's a rest for the people of God
[41:54] we cannot be at rest if we don't know
[41:56] the plan of God for our lives
[41:59] we cannot be at risk if we don't
[42:01] understand the Plan of Redemption
[42:04] Jesus said he that heareth my word
[42:07] and believeth on him that sent me half
[42:10] everlasting life
[42:12] and what what what are them other words
[42:16] and shall not
[42:18] everybody say shall not
[42:20] come into condemnation
[42:24] but his past from death into life
[42:26] now do you realize you're living in a
[42:28] world of condemnation
[42:30] this world all around you is being
[42:32] condemned
[42:33] look look at the look at the craziness
[42:36] that's out there is God's judgments
[42:37] beginning to pour out upon America upon
[42:40] the world
[42:41] and yet Jesus says he that believeth on
[42:44] me and heareth my words amen has already
[42:47] has that eternal life and shall not come
[42:50] in the condemnation now that God does
[42:54] not want his people coming to the house
[42:57] of God loaded with condemnation
[43:02] come on now you say well I just don't
[43:05] know if I'm going to make it but blessed
[43:06] God that ain't true worship
[43:08] that that ain't that ain't coming from a
[43:10] a Heart of Worship
[43:14] well it's true amen see now notice the
[43:18] prophet said if God Saves you knowing
[43:20] he's going to lose you he defeats his
[43:22] purpose
[43:26] if God saved you knowing he's going to
[43:28] lose you he defeats his purpose now do
[43:31] you think anything catches God by
[43:33] surprise
[43:34] absolutely not
[43:36] it's interesting I was reading last
[43:38] night in the Bible and and uh
[43:41] foreign
[43:44] of Syria
[43:46] that was sick
[43:48] so he had this man
[43:51] to go to the prophet Elisha I believe it
[43:53] was Elisha
[43:56] and he says
[43:59] the king wants to know Assyria is he
[44:01] going to die
[44:05] he said you go tell him he's going to
[44:06] live
[44:09] he said but he will die
[44:12] and the Bible says that the prophet also
[44:16] just started weeping
[44:18] he just got loaded and started weeping
[44:20] and just just travailing
[44:22] just sobbing
[44:24] and the Man Standing before him asked
[44:28] him said
[44:32] what's going on basically
[44:34] why are you weeping what's troubling you
[44:38] and the prophet looked at him says
[44:40] because I see
[44:42] I see what you're going to do
[44:45] the children of Israel
[44:48] I see that you're going to kill the
[44:50] children
[44:51] I see that you're going to rip the
[44:52] mother's babies out of their bellies
[44:55] I see what you're gonna and on and on as
[44:57] he's given this prophecy and the man the
[45:01] man even says what
[45:04] you think I'm a dog that would do this
[45:06] thing
[45:08] but you go read on down he done exactly
[45:10] what the prophet saw
[45:13] now you know I I got excited though
[45:16] because I thought see that's infinite
[45:19] knowledge
[45:21] and if God ever saved you
[45:24] he already saw you
[45:28] on the other side
[45:30] you understand what I'm saying
[45:32] and and what's amazing is there is a
[45:35] people that that God doesn't look at
[45:39] their sins
[45:43] can you say Amen
[45:44] now now notice if God Saves you knowing
[45:47] he's going to lose you he defeats his
[45:49] purpose he don't do that when he saves
[45:51] you you're saved
[45:54] when he saves you you're saved so there
[45:56] is nothing that is hindering the
[45:59] knowledge of God in the future and so he
[46:01] saves you today and then uh five years
[46:04] from now he goes oh my goodness I didn't
[46:05] see that coming that's not at all at all
[46:08] he saw you there and he showed even the
[46:12] prophet as he showed the prophet of this
[46:14] man of what he would do in the future he
[46:16] showed our Prophet that we were already
[46:19] there and the prophet said I saw you
[46:22] there
[46:23] yeah
[46:25] thank you it all hinges on
[46:27] predestination
[46:29] and that word predestinate means to
[46:31] happen now that have knowledge
[46:32] beforehand to foreknown to predetermined
[46:36] to decide beforehand to decree from
[46:39] eternity
[46:40] to foreordain ain't that right
[46:44] and the prophets that God could
[46:46] predestinate by foreknowledge he
[46:48] foreknew what would be not willing that
[46:50] any should perish that that all would
[46:53] come to repentance but being infinite
[46:55] and God he could predestinate and
[46:58] foretell by foreknowledge ain't that
[47:01] right now God acted upon that
[47:03] foreknowledge he knew you he saw you
[47:06] amen and before he ever created a man
[47:09] that first devil before he ever created
[47:12] uh anything that could fall amen he
[47:16] predestinated you he acted upon that
[47:19] infinite knowledge you understand amen
[47:21] so in Romans 8 29 for whom he did for no
[47:25] infinite knowledge he also did
[47:28] predestinate to be conformed to the
[47:30] image of his dear son that he might be
[47:33] the firstborn among many Brethren more
[47:36] over whom he did predestinate them he
[47:40] also called and whom he called them he
[47:43] also just unified and whom he justified
[47:46] then me also glorified can you imagine
[47:50] it's already done it's settled it's
[47:52] finished it is now we're entering into
[47:55] his rest do you think God's concerned
[47:58] about you do you think God has just
[48:00] taken nerve pills about you you're going
[48:02] through your trial you don't know what
[48:03] to do and you think God's panicking
[48:06] absolutely not he's already decreed and
[48:09] in for your life
[48:11] amen
[48:16] I hope this all right
[48:18] in Revelations 13 8.
[48:21] there is a book mentioned
[48:24] called the Lamb's Book of Life
[48:27] or The Book of Life of the Lamb
[48:30] and this verse tells us
[48:33] that there are names
[48:35] written
[48:36] in this book
[48:38] and those names represent people
[48:42] right
[48:43] and then people who does not have their
[48:47] names written in this book are going to
[48:50] worship the Beast yeah now that's
[48:53] already prophesied it's already done
[48:55] it's settled because the infinite god
[48:58] with infinite knowledge decreed it
[49:00] [Music]
[49:02] ain't that right
[49:04] but he wrote names down in that book for
[49:07] a reason
[49:09] you had a purpose for it
[49:11] because he's going to use them
[49:13] now when Jesus was on Earth
[49:16] that God same God that wrote your name
[49:19] in the Lamb's Book of Life dwelt in that
[49:22] body on Earth
[49:23] and he said Upon This Rock and that was
[49:26] the Revelation that Peter had and Upon
[49:28] This Rock I will build my church
[49:32] and we find out that that is the purpose
[49:34] of them names
[49:37] or we could say one of the purposes
[49:40] them names in that book
[49:42] and they realize Satan can't take them
[49:44] out of that book
[49:49] because see it was already declared
[49:51] there would be a church
[49:54] and it would be the Church of the Living
[49:55] God and that church would be a bunch of
[49:58] people who would be a tabernacle for the
[50:00] Living God
[50:01] can you say amen and while they're on
[50:04] Earth they would be the Tabernacle of a
[50:07] living God just as Jesus Christ was and
[50:10] would be it would produce the same
[50:12] ministry as Jesus Christ
[50:15] in my name you shall cast out Devils you
[50:17] shall lay on that your hands upon the
[50:19] sick and they shall recover you'll drink
[50:21] any deadly thing and it shall not harm
[50:24] you what's he talking about damn names
[50:26] that are in that book
[50:28] oh thank you Jesus
[50:33] Revelations 21 27 talks about the same
[50:36] book and calls it the Lamb's Book of
[50:38] Life
[50:39] it says and there shall in the wise
[50:41] enter into it speaking of that new city
[50:44] anything that defile us neither
[50:46] whatsoever worketh Abomination or maketh
[50:49] a lie
[50:50] but they everybody say they which are
[50:53] written in the Lamb's Book of Life
[50:56] think of that he's already got a place
[50:59] for you in the city
[51:01] ain't that right
[51:03] and nobody can take your place
[51:06] so he didn't come to replace you he come
[51:09] to redeem you
[51:11] because there's a city that's coming
[51:13] and he had a certain group of people
[51:15] them names written in the book that was
[51:17] going to be there
[51:18] it was worth every Agony that he did he
[51:21] went through it was worth every gasping
[51:24] breath he went through it was worth
[51:26] every beating he got and if there was
[51:28] only one name written in that book he
[51:31] would do it all over again amen because
[51:33] you cannot be replaced he come to redeem
[51:36] you to restore
[51:40] yes
[51:42] so there are people who have their names
[51:44] written in the Lamb's Book of Life and
[51:45] there's people that don't
[51:48] and as we go I'm going to get more into
[51:50] that
[51:51] but brother Brown says before the
[51:53] foundation of the world God wrote your
[51:55] name in the Lamb's Book of Life
[51:59] by his pen
[52:01] no
[52:02] by a spoken word
[52:05] now think of it because Jesus would tell
[52:07] us later on Heaven and Earth will pass
[52:09] away but my words will never
[52:11] that's right
[52:13] my word will never pass away
[52:16] and he's sent Christ the sacrifice
[52:19] to buy to redeem that same group that he
[52:24] had wrote their names in the Lamb's Book
[52:26] of Life before the foundation of the
[52:28] world can you say Amen so them names
[52:31] that were written before the foundation
[52:33] of the world that's what Christ came to
[52:36] redeem
[52:36] [Applause]
[52:38] amen do you realize there's not a name
[52:40] that can be added to the book out
[52:43] and there's not a name that can be taken
[52:45] from the book
[52:47] it's settled
[52:50] can you say man
[52:52] no matter how many revivals we have
[52:54] no matter how many movings of the spirit
[52:57] we have
[52:58] no matter how much good preaching we
[53:00] have it will not produce any more names
[53:04] than what was written before the
[53:06] foundation of the world
[53:09] brother Brandon said we wonder why the
[53:11] Revival is not going on right now why we
[53:14] don't see the enthusiasm with the people
[53:16] I don't know why but let's just think of
[53:19] it of it like this maybe there's a
[53:22] little boy in here tonight or a little
[53:24] girl was born over in Seattle Washington
[53:27] now that book holds her name ain't that
[53:32] right and he come to redeem whose name
[53:34] was written on that book and redeemed
[53:37] means to bring back where it fell from
[53:40] and in the human race that little girl
[53:43] was falling see and she can't accept it
[53:46] now because she's too young so the
[53:50] church will just slug right along just
[53:52] play along we'll have meetings and so
[53:55] forth till that last person is brought
[53:58] in then that book is closed there's no
[54:01] more added it's all over then can you
[54:04] say amen amen now I just happen to
[54:07] believe that there's a name on that book
[54:09] book that hadn't come in yet and and and
[54:12] the prophet said we'll go to the end of
[54:14] the road for the laws amen I don't
[54:16] believe that this bride will come in
[54:18] this age amen and as long as she lives
[54:20] on this in this earth that she will live
[54:23] without a burden for so somehow someway
[54:26] somewhere can you say man amen but now
[54:29] that's up to God why who comes in who
[54:31] doesn't but the church is just slugging
[54:33] right along and you might just say well
[54:35] why is it that we're just hanging out
[54:37] here and and you know there ain't
[54:38] nothing really happening we're waiting
[54:40] on a soul there must be a soul somewhere
[54:42] amen that's why I'm going to look at it
[54:44] can you say amen amen and that Soul amen
[54:47] God knew amen well to think of it now
[54:50] you just think of it my way for just a
[54:52] moment I thought well hear the prophet
[54:55] preaching souls in prison and all that
[54:57] he preached that what 65 63 I was born
[55:01] in 73 10 years later
[55:03] now I just happened you know because you
[55:06] know I I just I just like to believe
[55:09] that even though I I wasn't there in the
[55:13] meetings God would wait
[55:16] and wait and wait now I'm born in 73.
[55:20] but but you know I I was an honorable
[55:23] little rascal
[55:24] but he would wait on me
[55:28] you understand what I'm saying
[55:30] I I I well I had a desire for God I love
[55:34] God and God patiently waited
[55:37] and then when the right time came he
[55:41] sent a voice Boosh and grab my heart
[55:46] can you say amen amen and he'd been
[55:49] waiting on me
[55:50] now I don't know about sorry about you
[55:52] guys that are already perfected but he's
[55:53] been waiting on me you understand what
[55:55] I'm saying amen and and maybe there's
[55:58] some so out here in Blacksburg or
[56:00] Christiansburg and it may just be one so
[56:02] but I'll tell you it's worth the wait
[56:05] if it's worth the wait for God for that
[56:07] soul to come in it's worth the wait for
[56:09] us we're going to keep preaching we're
[56:11] going to keep seeing we're going to keep
[56:13] living we're going to keep testifying
[56:15] we're going to keep doing everything
[56:16] that we're doing for that one last soul
[56:19] [Applause]
[56:21] yes sir now notice God predestinated by
[56:25] foreknowledge and if God did that
[56:28] predestinated us before the foundation
[56:30] of the world and knew every one of us by
[56:33] name oh goodness he didn't just know the
[56:35] Stars by name that he knew you
[56:38] Knew You by name before the foundation
[56:40] of the world and he elected us to
[56:42] eternal life and sent Jesus Christ to
[56:45] redeem us that six thousand years ago he
[56:48] saw us that we might appear to his
[56:51] Praises in glory now notice the question
[56:55] he asked how can you ever be lost
[56:59] good Lord
[57:01] now if you're saved you're saved if God
[57:04] Saves you tonight knowing you're going
[57:06] to lose you 10 years from today he's
[57:07] defeating his own purpose the infinite
[57:09] Almighty Eternal Everlasting wisdom God
[57:12] doesn't know enough then to know whether
[57:14] you will hold out or whether you won't
[57:16] then when he saves you you say well I'll
[57:19] give him a try I'll see what he he'll do
[57:22] see then he does not know the end from
[57:25] the beginning can you say Amen I'll put
[57:28] it this way God ain't going to save
[57:30] people that's going to live half-hearted
[57:32] oh
[57:34] no this Church of the Living God ain't
[57:36] Half Half Baked Christians they ain't
[57:39] got one foot in the world and one foot
[57:41] in church no no no no no that that that
[57:44] wouldn't that be terrible if God Amen
[57:46] would call a people like that
[57:51] can you say Amen but he knew you'd be
[57:54] willing for to forsake the world
[57:57] amen that's right see so he says see he
[58:01] saves you and said well I'm going to
[58:02] give him a try say well see I'll see
[58:05] what he'll do then then he doesn't know
[58:06] the end from the beginning God knows
[58:09] what he's doing
[58:11] yeah
[58:12] hey amen amen have you ever just asked
[58:16] God why did you save me
[58:18] and I'll probably give you the answer he
[58:20] knows what he's doing
[58:24] don't you never worry about that
[58:28] it's you and I stumbling along but God
[58:30] knows what he's doing
[58:32] and he knew whether we would hold out or
[58:35] what we would do ain't that right I'm
[58:37] reading a lot of quotes but I hope
[58:39] that's all right remember he says the
[58:41] Bible said the Lamb's Book of Life was
[58:43] written before the foundation of the
[58:44] world and your name was put in that book
[58:47] when the lamb was slain before the
[58:48] foundation of the world to redeem every
[58:51] name that was put or written in that
[58:54] book
[58:55] another place that church is a
[58:57] predestinated church every name that was
[59:00] every put on that book Jesus came to
[59:02] redeem and when the last name is
[59:04] redeemed the book is closed he didn't
[59:08] intend that no one would be lost but by
[59:10] his foreknowledge let him know who would
[59:12] be lost therefore he could predestinate
[59:15] and then their names were put on the
[59:18] book
[59:19] John 15 16 Jesus said you've not chosen
[59:22] me but I have chosen you and ordained
[59:26] you that you should go and bring forth
[59:29] fruit and that your fruit should remain
[59:35] now whatsoever you shall ask of my
[59:38] father
[59:39] in my name he may give it to you so when
[59:42] was you chosen
[59:44] before the foundation of the world
[59:46] predestinated ain't that right
[59:49] so now listen to redeem anything
[59:52] is to bring back to its original place
[59:56] so it's only the predestinated that will
[1:00:00] be brought back
[1:00:01] he says because the others didn't come
[1:00:04] from there
[1:00:07] so so I want you to think of it when
[1:00:10] David is saying He restored my soul it
[1:00:12] isn't a lucky charm right
[1:00:15] it isn't because he rubbing the rabbit's
[1:00:18] foot
[1:00:19] or maybe luck was with him that day
[1:00:22] but he's saying I was in God's mind
[1:00:25] before the foundation of the world
[1:00:27] now that that means a lot
[1:00:31] ain't that right
[1:00:32] now there are those that that teach that
[1:00:35] the names that are written on the Lamb's
[1:00:37] Book of Life can be taken off that
[1:00:39] Lamb's Book but that's not true
[1:00:42] now you just look at David's life for
[1:00:45] just a moment look at David's life look
[1:00:47] at the sins he had he committed murder
[1:00:51] did he not committed adultery
[1:00:54] he numbered the people
[1:00:57] which calls 70
[1:01:00] 000 people to die
[1:01:03] because of his own actions
[1:01:06] and yet David said
[1:01:09] he restoreth my soul
[1:01:14] [Music]
[1:01:18] Psalms 32 2 it says blessed is the man
[1:01:21] unto whom the Lord imputeth not iniquity
[1:01:23] and remember this is David
[1:01:25] this is David that is saying he
[1:01:27] restoreth my soul
[1:01:30] now to the legalists how can his soul be
[1:01:32] restored when he done this and he done
[1:01:34] that and we saw him do this and we know
[1:01:36] he done this
[1:01:37] and yet David has said he restoreth my
[1:01:39] soul
[1:01:41] well David will answer you blessed are
[1:01:44] they whose iniquities are forgiven
[1:01:47] and whose sins are covered
[1:01:50] blessed is the man to whom the Lord will
[1:01:53] not imbue sin
[1:01:58] and instead of imputing sin he restoreth
[1:02:01] my soul
[1:02:04] praise the Lord and God
[1:02:07] so why did God ever allow sin in the
[1:02:10] first place
[1:02:12] as we know the prophet taught us because
[1:02:15] in God our attributes that had to be
[1:02:17] expressed
[1:02:19] sin never came to destroy you
[1:02:23] you with me
[1:02:24] God never did allow sin to come to
[1:02:26] destroy you
[1:02:28] or to eternally separate you from God
[1:02:33] do you realize that sin
[1:02:37] if your name putting on the Lamb's Book
[1:02:39] of Life no matter how low down you are
[1:02:44] sin isn't great enough to keep you
[1:02:47] from the love of God
[1:02:52] so therefore don't look at your sin
[1:02:56] look at the grace of God
[1:03:00] hello
[1:03:03] come on Amen don't look at your sin
[1:03:06] now God knew when he created Lucifer
[1:03:09] that he was going to be the one to
[1:03:10] corrupt the world
[1:03:12] but he created him with a purpose in
[1:03:16] mind
[1:03:17] for God is a savior
[1:03:19] God Is A Healer God is a deliverer God
[1:03:23] is a Waymaker God is a provider God is
[1:03:26] all in all
[1:03:28] right ain't that right
[1:03:30] yet he could not make not one of those
[1:03:33] attributes known
[1:03:36] unless there was a need for it
[1:03:40] ain't that right
[1:03:42] now there's a need
[1:03:45] because of sin
[1:03:48] ain't that right
[1:03:51] but God would never allow sin
[1:03:54] your sin or anyone else's sin to wipe
[1:03:58] away the memory
[1:04:00] from his mind
[1:04:02] your memory the memory of you
[1:04:05] hello
[1:04:07] he would never let your defiled nature
[1:04:11] and condition ever wipe away what he
[1:04:14] originally had of you
[1:04:17] there ain't no sin powerful enough
[1:04:22] is that right
[1:04:26] remember the prophet told us that God's
[1:04:28] thoughts are Eternal and they are real
[1:04:32] is that right
[1:04:34] so Satan has power
[1:04:36] but he will never be able to take you so
[1:04:39] low to where God wipes your name from
[1:04:41] this Lamb's Book of Life
[1:04:43] ain't gonna do it Satan's power is only
[1:04:47] made to be broken
[1:04:50] you believe that
[1:04:52] Satan's power over your life now God
[1:04:55] would allow Satan to dominate your life
[1:04:58] only to prove his own power
[1:05:02] he needed somebody to deliver so he says
[1:05:06] Satan take him to the lowest of hell and
[1:05:09] I will come back and I'll redeem them
[1:05:11] I'll bring them back
[1:05:14] you can put him on the deathbed but I'll
[1:05:16] restore their soul I restore their
[1:05:19] health foreign
[1:05:23] 's Powers the power of sickness it's the
[1:05:26] power of sin it's the power of
[1:05:29] depression it's the power of anxiety
[1:05:31] it's the power of complexes can you say
[1:05:34] Amen but the prophet would ask the
[1:05:37] question which is most powerful the
[1:05:39] Healer or your sickness
[1:05:42] can you say Amen what is most powerful
[1:05:45] your bondage or the the deliverer
[1:05:50] what is more powerful your sin or the
[1:05:52] savior
[1:05:54] can you say man
[1:05:56] and remember the prophet but Paul tells
[1:05:58] us there's none greater than God
[1:06:01] everybody say there's none greater
[1:06:03] there's none greater than God
[1:06:06] that's right there is not one creation
[1:06:08] that God would make that would become
[1:06:10] greater than he is the creator that's
[1:06:12] right and he's the only self-existent
[1:06:14] one he's the one everything else the
[1:06:17] Bible says was created from by him and
[1:06:20] for him and God ain't lost anything
[1:06:22] there's nothing out of control with God
[1:06:25] God knows your number he knows where you
[1:06:27] live he knows how to deal with you he
[1:06:30] knows the time clock that he's ordained
[1:06:32] for you amen he knows when you're going
[1:06:34] to come to Deliverance he knows when
[1:06:36] you're going to come through of
[1:06:38] everything that he's ordained for you he
[1:06:41] knows
[1:06:43] and you know what he knows what to do
[1:06:46] with your sin
[1:06:48] you think God's standing there baffled
[1:06:50] looking at you
[1:06:51] you think when he's a sinner painting
[1:06:53] the town red and just drugs and alcohol
[1:06:55] and whatever use them in or or probably
[1:06:58] even worse religion actually brother
[1:07:00] Brown said the word Spirit there is is a
[1:07:02] religious spirit
[1:07:03] [Applause]
[1:07:04] you can't even deal with them anymore he
[1:07:06] ain't got an ounce of repentance in and
[1:07:08] they're too religious
[1:07:09] you understand what I'm saying so that's
[1:07:11] the word spirit and then yet you were in
[1:07:13] that in that nonsense having a religious
[1:07:16] spirit Bound by that religion
[1:07:18] and you think God would stand in there
[1:07:20] saying oh my goodness I put his name in
[1:07:23] the book now what am I going to do with
[1:07:25] this guy no God knew what to do with you
[1:07:29] can you say Amen you deserved hell you
[1:07:32] deserve condemnation you deserved him to
[1:07:34] have lightning strike you many times but
[1:07:37] he knew what to do with you he saved you
[1:07:40] He restored your soul
[1:07:46] he knows what to do with the sickness
[1:07:49] that comes upon you he knows what to do
[1:07:51] with your sin sick soul can you say man
[1:07:54] that's why his blood is here
[1:07:57] [Music]
[1:08:00] you know what
[1:08:02] healer just takes the sickness away and
[1:08:04] destroys it
[1:08:06] the Savior just takes your sins away
[1:08:09] and just cast them into the sea of
[1:08:11] forgetfulness
[1:08:14] to think of that he created a sea of
[1:08:17] forgetfulness
[1:08:19] for who himself
[1:08:24] a god that is infinite
[1:08:26] that knows I every time
[1:08:29] that each flea bats its eye
[1:08:33] and counts the numbers of them
[1:08:35] nothing can escape his notice but he
[1:08:39] would create a seed just for your sins
[1:08:41] and he would cast him in the sea of
[1:08:43] forgetfulness and he himself cannot
[1:08:45] remember
[1:08:53] all I know it's the grace of God
[1:08:58] you love him
[1:08:59] amen so notice the lamb was slain before
[1:09:03] the foundation of the world
[1:09:05] brother Bram said God In His Infinite
[1:09:07] mind looking down through the streams of
[1:09:09] time and he saw what would take place
[1:09:11] and how he would have to create and drop
[1:09:13] down into the time of space to pull out
[1:09:16] what he really was
[1:09:20] now notice the prophet said put a man to
[1:09:22] the test and you'll see what he is
[1:09:24] really made out of
[1:09:27] put a woman to the test and you'll see
[1:09:29] what she's made of
[1:09:31] put a whiskey bottle
[1:09:34] under the nose of an alcoholic
[1:09:37] and see what he's made out of
[1:09:40] you'll see the prophet says whether he
[1:09:43] got delivered or not
[1:09:45] strip a woman down and let her go by a
[1:09:47] man that's been a rascal
[1:09:49] and is known to break other men's homes
[1:09:52] and you'll be able to tell whether or
[1:09:54] not that man's been delivered
[1:09:57] ain't that right
[1:09:59] let something happen in the church
[1:10:01] and see if that old gossiper
[1:10:04] has been delivered or not
[1:10:06] from that Spirit of gossip
[1:10:10] see
[1:10:13] you got to put them
[1:10:14] put it to the test
[1:10:17] now there's not one person
[1:10:20] whose name
[1:10:22] written in the Lamb's Book of Life that
[1:10:24] wants to sin and make mistakes
[1:10:32] Tommy wants to sin
[1:10:34] no
[1:10:36] how many likes making mistakes
[1:10:38] no
[1:10:43] yet David now I want you to notice this
[1:10:46] is David because again we're all like
[1:10:49] him
[1:10:52] David and all of his faults and all of
[1:10:54] his mistakes he would write my soul
[1:10:57] followeth hard after thee
[1:11:02] my soul
[1:11:05] and God would say of David I have found
[1:11:08] a man after mine own heart
[1:11:13] which shall fulfill all my word
[1:11:17] can you say Amen
[1:11:19] David didn't want to sin he didn't want
[1:11:21] to fail God
[1:11:24] and notice David had a repentant heart
[1:11:30] and if you'll notice the Zeal of the age
[1:11:32] is repent
[1:11:36] repent
[1:11:38] that's the Zeal of the age
[1:11:42] now it put God to the test
[1:11:46] what would God do with David's sin
[1:11:51] would he cast him out of his economy
[1:11:56] would he change his mind concerning
[1:11:59] David
[1:12:02] would he change what he said about David
[1:12:05] a man being after my own heart
[1:12:07] when he saw David commit the adultery
[1:12:10] and he saw David to have that had to
[1:12:12] bestowed one of his best soldiers
[1:12:13] murdered
[1:12:17] notice it's putting God to the test
[1:12:21] hello yes sir
[1:12:24] but David would say no he didn't cast me
[1:12:27] out of his economy He restored my soul
[1:12:32] so God passed the test
[1:12:38] hello
[1:12:39] he stood the test
[1:12:42] well what about David's sins
[1:12:46] God just provides an atonement for him
[1:12:48] [Music]
[1:12:50] then you say Amen
[1:12:52] the prophet said David after he did
[1:12:54] wrong and taken Uriah the hittite's wife
[1:12:58] the lovely Bathsheba and was going to be
[1:13:00] the father of her child and had caused
[1:13:03] her Gallant husband to be killed in
[1:13:05] battle when the prophet Nathan come in
[1:13:08] and revealed his sins to him then David
[1:13:10] thought on his ways and turned himself
[1:13:13] to repentance and sackcloth and Ashes
[1:13:15] that's the way to turn
[1:13:18] and God heard him
[1:13:20] and God will always hear a man or woman
[1:13:24] that'll turn their feet to his testimony
[1:13:28] and I say to you God will always stand
[1:13:31] the test
[1:13:33] can you say Amen
[1:13:35] he cannot forsake you
[1:13:39] he stood the test when he stood before
[1:13:41] Abraham as a man remember in Genesis 18
[1:13:46] and 10 God said to Abraham I will
[1:13:49] certainly Return To Thee according to
[1:13:51] the time of life and lo Sarah thy wife
[1:13:54] shall have a son and Sarah heard it in
[1:13:57] the tent door which was behind him now
[1:14:00] Abraham and Sarah were old and well
[1:14:02] stricken in age and it ceased to be with
[1:14:05] Sarah after the manner of women in other
[1:14:07] words she couldn't have children in
[1:14:08] these things see therefore Sarah laughed
[1:14:11] with inner self saying after I am waxed
[1:14:14] owed shall I have pleasure with my Lord
[1:14:16] being old also and and the Lord said
[1:14:19] unto Abraham wherefore did Sarah laugh
[1:14:23] saying shall I of a surety bear a child
[1:14:26] which am old is anything too hard for
[1:14:30] the Lord at the time appointed I will
[1:14:33] return to thee according to the time of
[1:14:36] life and Sarah shall have a son Uncle
[1:14:39] notice then Sarah denied saying I
[1:14:44] laughed not for she was afraid and God
[1:14:47] would tell her neighbor thou did us
[1:14:50] laugh
[1:14:51] can you say Amen now notice what danger
[1:14:54] she put herself in the prophet said God
[1:14:57] would have killed her right then
[1:15:01] right there on the spot can you say Amen
[1:15:04] but he couldn't do it the grace of God
[1:15:07] intervenes
[1:15:09] hey wow if he killed Sarah he would have
[1:15:12] killed Abraham
[1:15:15] can you say amen for the promise was she
[1:15:19] was part of the promise
[1:15:21] the Abraham God could not replace her
[1:15:23] with Hagar
[1:15:25] God not could not replace her with
[1:15:27] anyone else
[1:15:29] I hope you understand tonight amen and
[1:15:32] even though she deserved death and that
[1:15:34] righteous holy God being called a liar
[1:15:37] and should have struck her death he
[1:15:39] couldn't strike her he stood the test
[1:15:43] yay
[1:15:46] s our God
[1:15:48] in the lovely
[1:15:50] brother Brown said see our stupidity
[1:15:52] he'd kill every one of us but he can't
[1:15:55] take the church and destroy it he can't
[1:15:57] do it
[1:15:58] because it's part of himself Christ part
[1:16:00] of himself the word being made man flesh
[1:16:03] Oh Amazing Grace How Sweet the Sound see
[1:16:06] he couldn't do it he couldn't kill her
[1:16:08] he couldn't take her life because she
[1:16:10] was part of Abraham she was flesh of his
[1:16:12] flesh and bone of his bone ain't that
[1:16:14] right in another place he says in our
[1:16:17] mistake don't say well I made a failure
[1:16:19] no see that that don't make them Abraham
[1:16:23] had failures too I want you to
[1:16:25] understand that your failures don't rely
[1:16:27] and make excuses by your own failures
[1:16:32] yeah
[1:16:32] [Music]
[1:16:34] ain't that right
[1:16:36] God did not choose qualified people
[1:16:40] but he qualifies Those whom he chooses
[1:16:44] he didn't choose people that were Worthy
[1:16:48] but them that he choose he made Worthy
[1:16:53] he didn't choose a a sinless people but
[1:16:57] he took that people and made them
[1:16:59] sinless
[1:17:00] [Music]
[1:17:01] yet they still got their faults yet they
[1:17:03] still got their mistakes
[1:17:06] in their heart they don't want to make
[1:17:08] their mistakes
[1:17:10] can you say man in in their heart into
[1:17:13] doing everything they can to avoid their
[1:17:15] mistakes
[1:17:16] that brother Bradham said I have to
[1:17:18] repent every day
[1:17:20] can you say man
[1:17:22] but in all of that I stand sinless
[1:17:24] before God because there's an atonement
[1:17:29] so he said see couldn't take the church
[1:17:33] he can't kill the elected he can't take
[1:17:35] your life because you're a part of
[1:17:36] himself
[1:17:38] you're the word the word is in you it's
[1:17:42] manifest itself proving itself love joy
[1:17:44] peace long suffering all the words of
[1:17:47] God you believe every one of them work
[1:17:49] see and God working through you you're
[1:17:51] part of the word which is Christ we are
[1:17:54] taught that he is the word and we are
[1:17:56] flesh of his flesh bone of his bone
[1:17:58] there you are can you say Amen look at
[1:18:01] Christ he stood the test for the woman
[1:18:04] at the well
[1:18:07] she was a low down scum according to the
[1:18:10] to uh to society she was an outcast
[1:18:15] can you say Amen a prostitute and he
[1:18:18] knew who she was
[1:18:21] he knew and yet he said I must needs be
[1:18:24] go by the way of Samara he went out of
[1:18:26] his way for that little lady
[1:18:28] going out of his way for a prostitute a
[1:18:31] a person of ill thing but he stood the
[1:18:34] test
[1:18:36] because he knew down inside of her was
[1:18:39] the seed of life
[1:18:41] her name was written on the Lamb's Book
[1:18:44] of Life
[1:18:45] his love was greater than her sin
[1:18:48] can you say amen and he showed the sign
[1:18:51] of the Messiah and it redeemed her
[1:18:55] that's what the prophet said it redeemed
[1:18:57] her
[1:18:57] [Music]
[1:18:59] what about our sins
[1:19:02] as we close
[1:19:04] Psalms 103 10.
[1:19:06] he hath not dealt with us after our sins
[1:19:10] nor rewarded us according to our
[1:19:12] iniquities
[1:19:14] for as the heaven is high above the
[1:19:16] Earth so great is his Mercy toward them
[1:19:18] that fearing
[1:19:19] as far as the East is from the West so
[1:19:22] far hath he removed our transgressions
[1:19:25] from us
[1:19:26] stood the test
[1:19:28] he knew what to do with your sins
[1:19:33] yeah he came to redeem a basket case
[1:19:39] he put the names
[1:19:41] a veal
[1:19:43] famed people
[1:19:44] he put the names of people that weren't
[1:19:46] Worthy
[1:19:48] and he wrote him in a book
[1:19:50] because he knew what to do with you
[1:19:54] Micah 7 19 he will turn again
[1:19:58] he will have compassion upon us
[1:20:01] he will subdue our iniquities
[1:20:03] and that will cast all their sins into
[1:20:06] the depths of the sea
[1:20:09] amen
[1:20:11] you love him
[1:20:14] you say brother Branham I'm an awful
[1:20:16] woman I've lived illegally I've even
[1:20:18] broke my marriage vows I've done this
[1:20:21] brother Brian I tell you I've been a
[1:20:23] drunkard I've done this no matter what
[1:20:25] you've done God never looks at you
[1:20:27] he looks at the lamb
[1:20:30] and he's already accepted the lamb so
[1:20:33] you're free
[1:20:34] God can't see you he sees the lamb
[1:20:40] dies in your place in your stead can you
[1:20:43] say man
[1:20:45] if the musicians will come I thinking of
[1:20:48] and most of you I'm sure have heard of
[1:20:51] the testimony interview with sister
[1:20:53] Bruce
[1:20:55] but as she was dying brother Brown said
[1:20:57] I'm I'm fixing to pray for you she's on
[1:21:00] her death bed and brother Branham comes
[1:21:02] to pray for her and he says I'm not
[1:21:04] worthy of that I think well what if what
[1:21:06] would I do if Jesus Christ was sitting
[1:21:08] here now
[1:21:09] and what would he do if he was sitting
[1:21:12] here he'd lay his hands upon you and
[1:21:14] with his great faith say you'd get well
[1:21:17] well I think well I'm a sinner I'm not
[1:21:20] him but I come to represent him but
[1:21:23] remember me being a sinner and before
[1:21:25] God I'm not a sinner
[1:21:27] neither are you
[1:21:30] before God think of that before God
[1:21:33] we're not a sinner
[1:21:35] we got a blood sacrifice laying there
[1:21:37] God don't even see us he hears our voice
[1:21:40] but he sees the blood of Christ that's
[1:21:42] it see he sees the blood of his own son
[1:21:45] it's our voice Christ's blood then it's
[1:21:49] Christ that's talking through us to God
[1:21:51] so therefore we're not Sinners no more
[1:21:53] we are Christian
[1:21:55] I believe you he's talking to Sister
[1:21:57] Bruce to be a genuine Christian woman
[1:22:00] and I remember saying and notice what
[1:22:02] sister Bruce is doing
[1:22:04] she says but I make so many mistakes and
[1:22:07] I feel so many times
[1:22:10] notice the prophet that's why Christ had
[1:22:13] to die
[1:22:14] so that you with your mistakes wouldn't
[1:22:16] be lauded to you he took your mistakes
[1:22:19] your desire and your heart is deserve
[1:22:22] him
[1:22:23] sister Bruce says yes
[1:22:25] all right that's what he died for so you
[1:22:28] could serve him your mistakes are not
[1:22:30] looked are not allotted to you he's your
[1:22:34] propitiation he's your sin offering your
[1:22:38] sins are not known you're not a sinner
[1:22:40] before God Christ took your sins and
[1:22:44] became you because your desire is to
[1:22:47] serve him
[1:22:49] see he was always Jehovah Jireh our
[1:22:53] provider
[1:22:55] he was always Jehovah's Shalom our peace
[1:23:01] he was always Jehovah Nissi our Banner
[1:23:04] y'all can just play something
[1:23:06] he was always Jehovah rawhi
[1:23:09] our righteousness
[1:23:11] he was always Jehovah Shama
[1:23:15] the present one
[1:23:17] but it took a need
[1:23:21] for him to manifest what he was
[1:23:26] can you say man
[1:23:28] see so it wasn't to cast you out of his
[1:23:32] economy
[1:23:33] because no one can take your place
[1:23:36] that he could allow the things in your
[1:23:39] life he allowed them
[1:23:42] he didn't predestinate them he allowed
[1:23:45] them
[1:23:46] but you were predestinated
[1:23:48] to be conformed to the image of his son
[1:23:51] predestinated
[1:23:52] [Music]
[1:23:54] for a rapture
[1:23:57] predestinated
[1:24:00] and Calvary
[1:24:03] has stood the test
[1:24:05] do you believe it
[1:24:07] aren't you glad for Calvary
[1:24:09] Calvary
[1:24:11] has stood the test
[1:24:13] brother Brown said every born-again
[1:24:15] believer True Believer is perfectly
[1:24:17] absolutely sinless before God
[1:24:21] all we could go on and on and on
[1:24:24] but I love the Lord

[1:24:29] he restoreth
