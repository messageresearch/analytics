And um Amen. knowing that he will [music] hear our prayer and grant our request. Amen. And it's u good to be in the house of [music] the Lord once again and uh good to have said brother Tyler [music] with us. Amen. And we certainly appreciate him and his family. Praise the Lord. And um the uh [music] musicians can be dismissed. And so it's good to be back uh home. And um we [music] had a good time there in um Arkansas. And um trust um I heard y'all had a good service here uh Sunday and appreciate Daniel for um taking the service. Praise the Lord. And um on our way down, we kind of broke down there in Gayl or not Gayax but um um Withville and uh brother Matthew um Farmer, he saw us and so he stopped and we got to talk a little bit. So, but he asked me to greet you all. Amen. uh this evening. And so um brother Matthew said tell y'all hi. Praise the Lord. Uh if you have your Bibles, we're going to first of all go to the book of Genesis, the first chapter. And also just a reminder that um uh time goes back one hour um this uh weekend. And so, um, and also we'll be starting our Sunday service at 10:00 this Sunday. So, just remember that it be at 10:00 instead of at 11. Give us a little extra time. Amen. For fellowship. Praise the Lord. And uh but here we look Genesis 1 and3 but it says and God said let there be light and there was light. Amen. Then if you'll go to Isaiah chapter 55, a very familiar scripture to us. Isaiah 55. And uh we'll start at the 8th verse or at the ninth verse. It says, "For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways, and my thoughts your thoughts than your thoughts. For as the rain cometh down, and the snow from heaven, and returnneeth not thither, but waterth the earth, and maketh it bring forth and bud, that it may give seed to the swer, and bread to the eater. So shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth. It shall not return unto me void, but it shall accomplish that which I please, and it shall prosper in the thing whereto I sent it. Amen. One more scripture and that's in Matthew the 8th chapter uh Matthew chapter 8 and um [clears throat] fifth verse. And when Jesus was entered into compernum, there came unto him a centurion beseeching him and saying, Lord, my servant lith home at home sick of the Pauly grievously tormented. And Jesus saith unto him, I will come and heal him. The centurion answered and said,"Lord, I am not worthy that thou should us come under my roof, but speak the word only, and my servant shall be healed. For I am a man under authority, having soldiers unto me, and I say to this man, go," and he goeth. To another, "Come," and he cometh. And to my servant, do this. And he doeth it. And if you go down the 13th verse says, "And Jesus said unto the centurion, go thy way, and as thou hast believed, so be it done unto thee." And his servant was healed in the selfsame hour. Amen. Let's just bow our heads in a word of prayer. Father, as we have gathered this evening, no doubt there are needs that are present. And Father, you're the only one that can meet the need, Father. And we're just asking that you would do so tonight. And Lord, I pray that you would take what simple words we would have, just a simple thought, and that you would just uh reveal it in a greater light, Lord, to us, Father. And when we leave this place, Lord, we know that we had been with you. May you work in a supernatural way this evening. anoint both speaker and hearer is our prayer in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. And amen. So you can have your seats this evening and if I were to take a title it would be the supreme authority of the word. And um as you know um thinking of words a word uh whether it is a a spoken word or whether it's a word that is written down on a piece of paper it it it has to come from someone. Uh words are not just self-existent or whatever. it uh they they derive from from someone. We know that words are vital to us uh because this is how we communicate. Uh it's it's one of the main sources of communication uh is is through words. And I think I've uh said it before, but uh there was a study that was done uh on how many words a person speaks. And they say the average person speaks up to 16,000 words a day. &gt;&gt; That's a lot of words, which they did say that women speak a little bit more than men. I I've uh you know, just thought I'd throw that in there. But uh the average words that are spoken per hour is 941. That's the average. Now I don't know who does these studies but they uh they do them and and so um but we find that words are important uh on an everyday basis. Um and uh uh words reveal what is in a person's heart. Uh this is how we express things. Um words uh uh you know will express complexes that a person may have. Uh express uh inferiorities. Um words are used to convey hate, malice, um uh pride. Um the words words will do that but also words are used to express love &gt;&gt; um kindness, humility and and these things. Uh they they can also be used to deceive uh uh others or they can be used to reveal the truth. &gt;&gt; Uh words can be used to build up or to air down. Uh so uh words are important. Uh there's been many times that people's lives have been saved just because uh of the words because we use words to beg, to plead for mercy. Um we also use words to command and to express authority. If a person is plagued by fear and anxiety, well then uh the words he or she speak will express this uh uh they express the fear, they express anxiety, they express worry. Uh we we do these through through words that that we would speak. uh if a person is confident then he will uh express this confidence through the words that that he speaks. &gt;&gt; A person who possesses faith will speak words of faith. &gt;&gt; A person who speaks doubt will speak words of doubt. Um a person that's negative will just he will always his words will be negative. it it will uh and a person that's positive will speak uh words that are are positive. It's just that way. &gt;&gt; In the Old Testament, we find that Caleb uh uh was a man of faith &gt;&gt; and and his words expressed it. Uh for he he said, "Let us go up at once and possess the land. &gt;&gt; We are more than able to take it." and and his words was expressing uh what Moses the prophet had been telling them and and he had believed what the prophet said and and so when when the showdown came uh he was one that would express his faith in in words we're more than able you you don't find a person with faith uh saying well I don't think we can do this and I don't think God will heal and I just don't think but but we do find that uh the 10 spies uh being unbelievers well then they expressed it through through through through words and they they said we we be not able to go up against the people for they are stronger than we &gt;&gt; if you take numbers 13:32 and it tells us that these 10 spies brought an evil report by their words. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, so we can by our words have bring forth a good report. By our words we can bring forth an evil report. And they said the the land through which we have gone to search it is a land that eateth up the inhabitants thereof. And all the people that we saw in it are men of great stature. And there we saw the giants, the sons of Anch. And uh which come of the giants. And we were in our own sight as grasshoppers and so we were in their sight. Ain't that right? So, so their words as they expressed uh their unbelief and their doubt. Amen. And then the the effect that these words had upon the rest of the the the people, the 2 and 1/2 million people. Amen. uh uh numbers 14 and1 it says and all the congregation lifted up their voice and cried and the people wept that night and and all the children of Israel murmured against Moses. So notice this this the words that these 10 spies had brought words of unbelief now started uh to affect the it affected the the two and a half million and then they began to speak words of murmuring against the prophet and and and so they murmured against Moses and against Aaron and the whole congregation said unto them would God that we had died in the land of Egypt or What God we had died in this wilderness. Now think of that. That's the words that they were saying. And and wherefore hath God brought us unto this land to fall by the sword that our wives and our children should be a prey. He says uh they say were it not better for us to return into Egypt. And and they said one to another, let us make a captain and let us return into Egypt. So, so that tells us that when words are spoken in in a negative way, there's something down inside of the heart that that is causing these words to come. &gt;&gt; Amen. But you'll never get Caleb to talk in a negative way, not toward the message, not toward the prophet, not not toward the promises that God had had given because he was a man of faith. And and he would express these in in words. Now, I find that that spirits um uh they they work through words. They they uh um uh work through words that are spoken or and even work through words that are written down and and and also they anoint people to speak words. Amen. Just like Satan, he he he in the beginning he moved uh uh was able to get in and work through that serpent. Amen. To Eve, God had said spoke his word, his law, and Satan was able to work through that serpent and began to speak. again. But he spoke words of deception to where it would cause Eve to to be deceived and and to to break God's laws. We also find in First Kings um 22 and 20 uh uh it it tells us that God sent a lying spirit, a man, to deceive Ahab. And and notice now, and the Lord said, who shall persuade Ahab that he may go up and fall at Ramothth Gilead? And one said, on this matter, and another said on that matter, and there came forth a spirit, and stood before the Lord, and said, I will persuade him. And the Lord said, well, how are you going to do that? In other words, wherewith and he said, I will go forth and I will be a lying spirit in the mouth of all of his prophets. and and he said, "Thou shalt persuade him, and prevail also. Go forth and do so." Now, therefore, the behold, the Lord hath put a lying spirit in the mouth of all these thy prophets, uh uh Micaiah speak unto uh Ahab, and the Lord has spoken evil concerning thee. Ain't that right? See, so so words can be anointed uh of of uh people can be anointed of the devil of Satan just to speak words and and and uh uh these things. And so therefore it it it behooves us to guard our mouth. It behooves us to guard our heart. It behooves us not just to say words. Amen. but to watch what is motivating us uh uh uh the words that are spoken. Now you know uh brother Brandham in in speaking to people uh who just gave their heart to the Lord and he said this. He says come into the church of wherever church you prefer. But remember make it a church that believes in divine healing and the full gospel because some of them others will pump poison into you and you'll lose your experience after all. So think of it. Amen. Uh uh through through false words, through words that would be against God, uh uh words that would try to get us to doubt the word of God. Amen. Is nothing but poison to us. Amen. And that's what Satan does. Satan by words can put poison into us. Amen. And to where we actually lose the victory. we we lose the victory. Can you say amen? Now, uh a question was asked, brother Brandham said, "Brother Beal, can can the Lord do effective work through me in a congregation where they do not believe in the spiritual gifts?" Now, notice, he says, "I doubt it very much. I'm I'm very much in doubt, dear friend, that the Lord could efficiently work through you because you are linked up among unbelievers." And the Bible said, "Yoke yourself not up with unbelievers, but come out from among them, and be ye separated, said the Lord, and then I will receive you." See, now I I believe if you live in a city where there is a church that does believe in signs and spiritual gifts, and you have them things working on you, I would go to that church where they believed it. Ain't that right? Because people that just they if if they don't believe in something, they're going to express it in words. People that do believe in things in something, they're going to express it in in words because they're going to communicate what what they believe. They're going to communicate with what they don't believe in and and and these things. Can you say amen? So, Brother Bram said, "Unbelievers will actually hurt you." Amen. because they speak words that are anointed with the spirit of unbelief. &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Bram says, "Don't yoke up your yourself up unequally." Amen. He says, "I've seen people come to the platform and be healed, walk away, and mix up with unbelievers and their sickness come right back to them again." Ain't that right? So words have a a an authority. Words have power. Words, amen, can can be positive or or negative and and and and and what what we what what words do is expressing a spirit that that is or the nature of of an individual. Amen. See, and so the the kind of words that are spoken and the kind of words that that we hear matter to us and it matters to God. A ain't that right? See, Jesus said, "The words that I speak, they are spirit and they are life." Ain't that right? So the words that I speak, they're spirit and then life. So then the words that Satan would speak, Amen, would be words of destruction and words of death, u uh words that would um uh destroy our experience in God. Ain't that right? See, and so now thinking of the words, the way the words uh uh are spoken depend upon who is the who is speaking them. The way a words are used, the way the words are are are voiced or written, it depends on who is speaking them. See, not all words and now uh uh not all words have authority in them. And and um uh you you see the person that speaks a word must be in a position of authority before his or her word has authority. Ain't that right? See, a a word of a king is far different than the word of a beggar. A ain't that right? Amen. When a king speaks, he speaks with authority. When a beggar speaks, he speaks with with uh uh just a common word. Uh maybe asking for for shelter, asking for food, asking for help. Amen. See, he's using words to to uh uh uh express his need. where as a king, he's using words to express his authority and his position of power. The word of a judge is far different than the word of a convicting failing. See, and and and so see the word that that a king or a judge would speak, Amen. It it's the word of authority because they are in authority. Can you say amen? They're they're in authority. So whether they speak words or write words on a piece of paper, see they are words of authority. Ecclesiastes 8 and4 it says where the word of a king is, there is power. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? Not just where the word uh of of somebody or anybody is, there's power. the word of a king, because that king is in a position of authority. And where that word of a king is, then there is power. And who may say unto him, "What doest thou?" Why? He's in a he's a he's in a position of sovereignty. He's sovereign. He can use his word in and no matter what. Uh he can use words to condemn. He can use words to uh to pardon. He can use words uh uh whatever because he's in this position of authority. Ain't that right? Within the government uh uh uh the United States, you know, uh authority is exercised by men who are in authority. And and the greater the position uh power a man has uh the the greater authority his words will have. A ain't that right? Amen. There's different levels of of uh positions and things in in in the government. Now, now government uh it's it means the continuous exercise of authority over and the performance of functions for a political unit. The the body of persons that constitutes the governing authority of a political unit or organization or uh or whatever. So men govern with authoritative direction or control. Amen. Men that are in government and in position of authority. It's they don't ask us what we want. They don't ask us what they should do. They they're in a position of authority. So they they use words uh uh to command. They they use words to establish laws and to enact laws and and and these things because it's it's a a word of authority within the government. There are different roles and positions and ranks. Uh there you you have uh uh a policeman that that is a a uh authoritative figure. You you have the mayor, he's an authoritative figure. You you have the governor that's an authoritative uh figure. You you have the congressman and the senators and and and the president and and all of these are are different levels of of government and and and each one of these have a different level of authority. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? and and and so they have this this this uh uh level of authority and their authority uh operates within their jurisdiction. Now I've thought of this word jurisdiction. It's the limit or territory within which authority may be exercised. So so the policeman has his jurisdiction of authority. Amen. and within his jurisdiction when he's operating and well then he's got an authority, a man, to command and and and and these things. Well, then the mayor, he has his jurisdiction of of authority to what where he operates and his words mean something. A ain't that right? Amen. If he's a mayor of this of this city, well, his words mean something here. But but now it wouldn't matter if it it wouldn't mean anything if he went down to Pawne Oklahoma and and started uh that's not his jurisdiction. Amen. His jurisdiction is here right in this city. Uh the governor has his own jurisdiction and and his jurisdiction or his authority uh is greater than the authority of the mayor or uh uh or maybe even that of the policeman. Uh and his jurisdiction is is spread out not just to a city, but it's to the state of Virginia. Ain't that right? Amen. And then there's the president that has jurisdiction. Amen. wherein he can exercise his authority and and and and uh over the nation and and these things. But but in their office, in their jurisdiction, each man can can speak words uh of authority. Now, thinking of this, Psalms 103:19, "The Lord hath prepared his throne, in the heavens, not not in a a state or not in a country, not in a city, but in the heavens." Amen. And his kingdom, everybody say, his kingdom ruleth over all. Amen. See, so it's a kingdom that is greater than any other kingdom on this earth. Amen. It it his kingdom ruleth over all. Amen. Whether it's Satan's kingdom and and and uh in invisible kingdom and and a ruler. Satan is the ruler of darkness and and and he's got his kingdom. He's got his domain. And yet the Bible says that God reignth over all, visible, invisible. Well, ain't that right? Amen. Psalms uh 47 and8, God reignth over the heathen. God siteth upon the throne of his holiness. Amen. See, so God's kingdom uh if if we could say it, God's rule isn't something that he's ruling somewhere and and and all men is ruling and they've got their jurisdiction. God is got his own jurisdiction, but God's jurisdiction is over heaven and earth. Amen. He rules over everything. Do you believe that? Amen. See, so his power is not limited. His his authority is not limited. His his word is not limited to anything. Amen. Uh uh Proverbs 21 and1 it says the king's heart is in the hand of the Lord. as the rivers of water, he turneth it whethersoever he will. Now, we can we we we can read a lot of scriptures concerning the the power and the authority and the sovereignty of God. God doesn't have to ask for permission. God doesn't have to uh uh seek our guidance and our will and and and and these things. He he just does exactly what he wants to do. And he tells us that my word will not return unto me void. Amen. That when I speak my word, it's going to accomplish. It's it's going to perform, Amen. that which I have sent it to do. So when we look at God's kingdom and God's authority, well, God's kingdom is is greater than man's. It's it's greater than any authority that man may have. &gt;&gt; We think of God, we think of supreme. Amen. The prophet said, "God is supreme." How many believes that? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God is supreme. We must not forget that church. Amen. That God is supreme. His kingdom is supreme. His government is supreme. His reign is supreme. His word is supreme. Amen. You know, within the United States, we have uh uh different types of courts. Uh we have federal court and we have the state courts and uh a lot of lot of courts and things and and within the federal courts uh there there's the district courts um which serve as trial courts of general jurisdiction. But then there's also the the courts of appeals. Amen. But then the highest federal court in the land is what? The Supreme Court. Ain't that right? The Supreme Court. Now I I I brother Bram had talked on this. I think the Supreme uh in uh courts and and and uh the uh in the absolute and things, but but I looked up the word supreme. It's highest in rank or authority. True. &gt;&gt; A position of unquestioned authority. This is what supreme means. Now, it's the highest in rank or authority. A position of unquestioned authority, dominance or influence, paramount, sovereign, chief. Ain't that right? So, so when the word supreme is connected to something, amen, then that something becomes the ultimate or the the the final say, the final authority. Amen. All the other courts, it it's just courts. It's it's it's it's this. But then there's a supreme court. Amen. which which tells us that you know uh uh uh a a lower court can a judge of that has the authority and and and maybe he'll decide a case and he'll say well this is the way it's going to be. Amen. Well, that person could say, "Well, hold it. I I I think I'm going to appeal that." And and he appeals it and it goes to a higher court and and and then it can go all the way up to the Supreme Court. Amen. And so when it gets to the Supreme Court, then once a decision is made in that court, then that is the final say so. &gt;&gt; Amen. Can you say amen? And they can speak even contrary to the lower courts. Amen. The lower courts could decide something. But if the Supreme Court decides contrary, Amen. Then we'll go by what the Supreme Court says and not by what this says. Can you say amen? Amen. See, so so we find amen that the supreme it it shows that you have come to the absolute. Amen. In in in when when supreme has come. Amen. See, and and and so we we find that uh uh there's no more argument. There's no more chance to appeal because the case has come to its ultimate. The word ultimate means the end, the maximum, the last, the amen. Can you say amen? Amen. It's come to its end. Can't keep dragging it out. Can't question it. Amen. You've got to abide by what that Supreme Court has has said. Ain't that right? See? Well, now, Brother Brandham talks about the judges in England and and they probably might still do it today, but but when they're preciding over cases, amen, the judges will wear a white wig. Amen. And uh but there's a reason why they wear that wig. And brother Brandon says, see, they wear that white wig to show that there's no other authority in that kingdom that's above their word. They are ruling as the absolute. &gt;&gt; They are ruling as the final. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. They are the final word in that kingdom. And there's no other word above their word. See, it's the ultimate of the kingdom. Well, we could say it this way. God's word is the ultimate. And man, it's the ultimate. It's the It's the final say. Aren't you glad for that? It's the final say. And in his word is mercy. And in his word is grace. And in his word is the power to deliver. The power to pardon. Amen. The power. Amen. To set free. Amen. Now the word is the ultimate. And the word always comes to a &gt;&gt; prophet. Can you say amen? Amen. See, so it is not just a word that comes to a prophet. It's the supreme word of God that comes to a a vindicated prophet. Now, brother Brandham tells us that any gift uh a prophecy has to be judged. Amen. If if I come and I say, you know, thus sayith the Lord, yada yada yada yada, you know, and and I give a a prophecy, well, it cannot the church cannot receive that until there's been two or three judges that sit there and judge that prophecy to see if it's of the Lord or not. Now, Brother Brown said, "The reason why is because Satan can slip in there, Amen, and start speaking something." Amen. I've seen prophecies break up churches. I've seen prophecies break up marriages. I've seen prophecies break up homes and families. Amen. Because they weren't of God, Satan slipped in there and and and brought a a word of division in the name of the Lord. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. See, but with a prophet now, see a a prophet, a vindicated prophet has to stand before no man. Amen. No. No man. Amen. A prophet uh uh doesn't have to be judged. Why? The supreme word. &gt;&gt; The supreme word has come to him. &gt;&gt; Amen. And and Satan can't slip in there in in a vindicated prophet. &gt;&gt; I know people in this message, you know, uh that claim to be in this message, they they're acting like we've got to judge the brother Brandham by the word of God. Amen. And instead of instead of judging the prophet judging us, Amen. Uh uh we they're saying we ought to judge him. Amen. And and trying to tell us where he missed it and he he did this and he did that. Well, church, they don't know what a prophet is then. Amen. For a word that comes to a prophet, and I'm talking about a vindicated prophet, is the absolute. It's the supreme word. It's the final say. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; His word is supreme because it's the word of the Lord that has come to him. So therefore, the word that he speaks is the absolute. &gt;&gt; I know people have a hard time with that. That the message being the absolute. This message is the absolute to the believer and it is the absolute to the world. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And they will be judged by the message. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? So now, brother Brandon says, "Whoever stood to judge Isaiah to see whether his prophecy was right or not, they know from his time through through that he was a prophet who stood to say to Jeremiah when God told him he had made him a prophet before his born from his mother's womb." See all and all those who lived right, they know he was a prophet. And I say this, every believer in this age knows that brother Brandham was a prophet. That's just that's just way we believe it. We know it to be so, right? Believers know. See, another place he said there's nine spiritual gifts in the church. They might be like on this man tonight and one over here uh and so forth, you know. Uh, but prophecy of that type has to have two or three witnesses to look it over, judge it, and see if it's right or not. But you never saw them stand before Isaiah or Jeremiah or any of them to judge them. For they had thus sayith the Lord from their birth. &gt;&gt; Amen. Not not hitting and missing. Not not saying something in the name of the Lord and it not be and then saying something in the name of the Lord and that be true and and all these things. No, they had thus said the Lord from the beginning. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? So he says another place, you never did you see anybody stand before Isaiah to judge it. He was born a prophet. And them prophets, they had thus said the Lord right up through their life. Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; I I thought of the words uh you know the word of the prophets was Jesus's absolute. Yeah, &gt;&gt; they were his absolute. &gt;&gt; He fulfilled every word that they said, spoke concerning him. &gt;&gt; He quoted their words, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Sure he did. See, he he lived by their words. He received the revelation of who he was by their words. Ain't that right? And he told them, he told his critics, "Search the scriptures." &gt;&gt; For in them you think you have eternal life, but they testify of me. &gt;&gt; What was he doing? He wasn't taking them to some wild blue yonder. He wasn't writing some new Bible. &gt;&gt; He was telling them, "Go back to the prophet's words. That's the absolute. And if you can see it, you'll find who I am." Amen. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; So Jesus recognized the authority of their word. See, then we find that the word became flesh. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That supreme word became flesh and dwelt among us. And a man in human flesh exercised supreme authority. &gt;&gt; [snorts] &gt;&gt; The same word that said, "Let there be light." And there was light now [screaming] was in a man being spoken in human &gt;&gt; flesh. &gt;&gt; Jesus had supreme authority over the winds and waves, did he not? &gt;&gt; He showed he had supreme authority. &gt;&gt; He showed that he had supreme authority over the water by turning it to wine. Amen. And he showed that he had supreme authority by causing the blind to see and the lame to walk. He showed that he had supreme authority when he stood at the grave of Lazarus who had been dead four days and and and called Lazarus come forth. Amen. And and Lazarus came forth. Amen. It was not just a word of of the Pharisees. It wasn't just the word of a church. It was the word of God which was supreme authority. &gt;&gt; Amen. Mark 1:21. And they went into compernum. And straightway on the Sabbath day he entered into the synagogue and taught. Now notice he went into the church and he taught. And they were astonished at his doctrine. For he taught them as one that had authority &gt;&gt; and not as the scribes. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Now the the scribes, they taught the word. Amen. And and no doubt that they exercised what authority they had in their church. The Pharisees taught the word and and all that. and and and and no doubt they exercise the authority that they were given within their church, their denomination or whatever. But the Bible says that that Jesus taught as one with authority, not as the scribes. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? So he just didn't teach with authority. Amen. But he taught with supreme authority. Now, there's a difference there, right? Amen. He taught with supreme authority. Amen. There's people maybe that takes that word and they have the authority from their church or from their seminary and and maybe they've got degrees of of in scripture and they're theologians and they've got this an authority that the church has given them to stand behind the pulpit and to teach the word. But Jesus was one who taught the word with supreme authority &gt;&gt; for he was the word. Right? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Then then what does that mean then? Then his teaching was the final say. Yeah. &gt;&gt; You you you you you ain't going to take his teaching and just use it for a reference and and and and then use the Pharisees and the scribes teaching as a reference and then come up with your own idea. Jesus taught with supreme authority. &gt;&gt; So whatever he taught was the final say over it all. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? His teaching was the absolute and was the amen. So therefore, if their teaching, if the teaching of the scribes and the Pharisees and the Sadducees didn't line up with his teaching, then the people had every right not to listen to them because now [screaming] there was a teaching that had supreme authority. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; See, his teaching had greater authority in it. Yeah. &gt;&gt; A man may have authority in his home as as being the head of the home. A pastor may have authority in the local church as being the head of that local assembly. Men might hold different uh uh positions uh in the church and and they have this authority whether it may be you know deacons or uh uh song leaders or uh trustees or whatever. Amen. Would would uh be there and maybe even part of the five-fold ministry uh uh of of these things. Women even might have a level of authority. Uh I I believe a woman does have have a a level of authority in the home. Amen. To teach their children the ways of God and and and to teach them how to love and to respect and and and raise them in the fear of the Lord. Can you say amen? that no matter what authority a man has and and has the right to exercise, that authority must come under subjection to supreme authority. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? It must come under sub subjection to supreme authority. Sir, &gt;&gt; amen. I don't believe this message was just for the church to teach us seals and teach us whatever. I think it was there for our homes. It was there for us men. It was there for our families, our marriages. I I don't believe you need to go outside and get psychology. Amen. To fix your marriage. I I just think you ought to just subject to the word of God. No matter what position you have, there has been a supreme authority. That's right. Amen. Can &gt;&gt; can you say amen? &gt;&gt; See, and so therefore, the authority of men has to come subject to supreme authority. &gt;&gt; Now, in the book of Revelations, John saw one likened to the son of man walking in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks, uh, which is the seven churches. And notice this one walking in the midst likened to the son of man. He had in his right hand seven stars. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; In his right hand. And in Revelations 1:20 it says, "The mystery of the seven stars which thou sawest in mine right hand and the seven golden candlesticks." The seven stars are the angels of the seven churches. and the seven candlesticks which thou sawest are the seven churches. So, so we we know as message believers uh that the seven angels messengers were in the right hand of the one like the son of man. And notice there is an elect right there. Brother taught us in each age there is an elect. But but John did not tell us that that elect was in the right hand. &gt;&gt; Hello. &gt;&gt; We don't see the elect in the right hand of God. &gt;&gt; But we see seven angels. &gt;&gt; Seven messengers. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; See, and these seven messengers in the right hand of God were sent one to each age. Seven ages. Seven messengers with seven messages. a message per age. Ain't that right? And they were sent to pull the elect out of that age, out of the organizational system. &gt;&gt; Brother Ram said, "It's the Holy Spirit that's built that bride, the elect that's pulled out of all the organization systems down through the ages." See, and and if you notice in each of the church ages, God addresses uh uh the angel of that age unto the angel of the church of Ephesus, unto the angel of the church of Sernrra, unto the angel of the church of Thatara, all the way down to the Leoa. Ain't that right? And brother Brown said, "Why?" Because that angel that that's in the hand of the the right hand of him, he's the leader of that church age. ain't bunch of leaders. God doesn't recognize a bunch of leaders. Amen. He recognizes one leader to each age with an authority. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? And the message is addressed to him. &gt;&gt; Now, Brother Bram says, "God help that guy that'll pull away from that message." But it was given to an angel and the angel was in his hand. Notice under his own control. See the angel in his hand, under God's control, &gt;&gt; giving it thriving power from him, from his right hand. See, they're in his right hand. That is, they're in supreme power while they're here on the earth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. supreme power while they're here on the earth giving their message because they are the lights from him giving the light to that church age. &gt;&gt; It's just like Noah's message, a one-man message given to that whole world in that day. Amen. And his message was supreme authority for that age. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? couldn't get around it. Amen. No matter how many other messengers rose up and no matter how many others, Brother Graham said, "No doubt other other boats were being built." But God had one man on the earth at that time with the supreme authority. He had the authority to build an ark. He had the authority, amen, to preach that there's a flood coming. He had the authority. It was the supreme authority &gt;&gt; over all other messages in that day. Amen. &gt;&gt; Over other builders in that day. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? And if you notice these messengers were connected to Christ held in his right hand. Brother Brand says right hand, the right hand or arm signifies the power and authority of God. &gt;&gt; Think of that now. They came with the authority of God for that age. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To pull out an elect. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; See, signifies the power and authority of God. Psalms 44:3. For they got not the land in possession by their own sword, neither did their own arm save them, but thy right hand and thine arm. See, that's how they got saved &gt;&gt; is by his right arm and thy his right hand and the light of thy countenance because thou hastest a favor unto them. &gt;&gt; So the seven stars, these messengers with the message to each age are in his right hand. Amen. Which signifies, brother Brown says that the very power and authority of God are behind his messengers to every age. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Isn't that wonderful? &gt;&gt; I believe. &gt;&gt; Amen. Think of it. We could be sitting under another message. We could be caught up in some other doctrine without no authority from God. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Maybe authority from a church. Maybe the church backs it up. But let let God [screaming] back something up. &gt;&gt; And here we are tied to the thing that God places his approval on and his authority. &gt;&gt; John wrote about the seven spirits of God sent forth throughout the aven spirits. They're the seven messengers. Seven messengers. Colombia, Ireina, St. Martin Wesley, you know, Martin Luther and and and I say, "Brother Brandham, &gt;&gt; Amen. We we don't have to wonder and guess who's the messenger is of this seventh age." Can you say, "Amen." Brother Brham said, "These seven messengers are making God known to the people." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. Come on now. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They're making God known to the people. It ain't It ain't these TV evangelists. &gt;&gt; It ain't these radio preachers. It ain't the psychologist, Christian psychologist. It ain't. There's one man in the age today that has made God known to us. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And God has had one man to each age to make himself known through that man, through that message. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Jesus said in John 13:20, "Verily, verily, I say unto you, he that receiveth whomsoever I send receiveth me, and he that receiveth me receiveth him that sent me." &gt;&gt; So then the prophet said, "These messengers speak and act upon his authority. He stands behind them with all the power of the godhead." &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Another place he says they go forth in the power, fire, and power of the Holy Ghost with the word. They are stars because they reflect light. The light they reflect is his light. They have no light of their own. They kindle not their own fires that men may walk in the light of their sparks. Ain't that right? So here another place it says see see him him walking through the the these church ages the Christ making himself known to his people down through these dark ages and down through every age. &gt;&gt; See while the church got formal and pulled out and some went one way some another but that little minority of the church still held on and Christ worked with them confirming his word. Why? Because that God would send a messenger to that age with the divine authority &gt;&gt; and the elect grew or or gravitated to that message. &gt;&gt; That messenger &gt;&gt; and God was with them. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says each time that the star came on the scene, the Holy Spirit came down and anointed that star and kept it just exactly like the first one was. We know the first one was Paul, right? &gt;&gt; Amen. See, and so the the elect of each age recognized the the word of of authority that the messenger of their day had just as the centurion did in Jesus's day. Amen. When he said, "My servant my servant is is is sick. He's dying." Amen. And and and I I need you. Amen. What Jesus said, "Well, I'll just come over and and I I'll lay my hands on him." No. No, no. That centurion recognized an authority. [screaming] &gt;&gt; Recognized the authority. &gt;&gt; I'm under authority. &gt;&gt; Amen. But notice, he recognized that the authority Jesus had was above his authority. &gt;&gt; He recognized that Jesus had supreme authority. Can you say amen? He didn't have the authority. Amen. This this man realized he didn't have the authority over sickness and over death and and diseases and and all of these things. But here was a man that had a supreme authority. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The authority that could command demons to leave. Just speak the word. Can you say amenise the Lord? Mark 1:23 says, "And there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit, and he cried, saying, Let us alone, for what have we to do with thee, thou, Jesus of Nazareth? Art thou come to destroy us? I know thee who thou who thou art, the Holy One of God?" And Jesus rebuked him, saying, Hold thy peace, and come out of him. &gt;&gt; Amen. And when the unclean spirit had torn him and cried with a loud voice, he came out of him. And they were all amazed in so much that they questioned among themselves, saying, "What thing is this? What new doctrine is this? For with authority commandeth he even the unclean spirits, and they do obey him." &gt;&gt; Oh my. with supreme authority. He commanded spirits to leave the people. Why? His word was the final say. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; Doctors can say one thing but let God speak. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And that becomes the final. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; See, and so we find that God being the word, God's the word and the word made manifest. Now, Matthew 2:6, "And thou Bethlehem in the land of Judah? Art not the least among the princes of Judah, for out of thee shall come a governor that shall rule my people Israel." &gt;&gt; Well, [snorts] aren't you glad for that? &gt;&gt; Amen. A governor that will rule my people, Israel. Amen. Not Satan the ruler. Amen. I'm so glad for that. Amen. See, and that prophet reading this scripture, he says, "The Holy Spirit today rules over the people." And the Holy Spirit is the word. Somebody say, "The Holy Spirit is the word." &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit ruling over the people. Amen. A sovereign rule, a supreme rule by the supreme word. Now notice and I I hope this all right but brother Brandham says in the days of the seventh messenger in the days of Leoian age its messenger will reveal the mysteries of God as revealed to Paul he will speak out and those who receive that prophet in his own name will receive the benefit effect of that prophet's ministry. And they that hear him will be blessed and become part of that bride of the last days who are mentioned in Revelations 22:17. Well, what does it say in Revelations 22:17? The spirit and the bride say come. &gt;&gt; The spirit and the bride say come. &gt;&gt; I I think that means something to us. Those that receive that prophet of this last day, a prophet of Malachi 4, that seventh angel messenger, Amen. Those who receive his message, Amen. and receive that prophet in his own name will receive the benefit effect of that prophet's ministry. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; It It's no longer It's not just us saying, "Well, brother Brandham done it. Brother Brandham did it. Brother Brandham did it." But there is a people that's received him. receive what he had to say and they become part of that ministry. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? And they that hear him will be blessed and become part of that bride of the last day mentioned in 22:17 Revelations. See, so what that tells us is is is we've had a prophet come with with a a a a voice of authority, but now the bride is going to speak. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? And brother Brown says, "The word is in the bride." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? Can you say that with me? The word is in the bride. Well, what word is in this bride? A supreme word. The word that come to a prophet, she has received it. And that word now [screaming] is in her. &gt;&gt; Isn't that what Paul says? The word of faith is nigh thee, even in thy mouth and in thine heart. That is the word of faith which we preach. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; So, it's a word of authority that's in the bride. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; You may not have much in life. You may not have no position of authority in life. You may not be the governor, the mayor, or some politician. We don't have to strive for that. We've got an authority, &gt;&gt; a supreme authority. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What is it? It's showing that the sons and daughters are coming into adoption, &gt;&gt; a position of authority. Can you say amen?

And and and and then her words are being changed in a higher court, but whatever she says. Amen. The supreme God backs it up because it is the supreme word of [screaming] God that she is speaking. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's true.

He says, "I took the little book." Amen. Revelations there uh uh 10 and 10. I took the little book out of the angel's hand and ate it up. It was in my mouth sweeted as was sweet as honey.

Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; He said it was in in my belly bitter. And he said unto me, "Thou must prophesy again before many peoples, nations, tongues, and kings." If you go to 2 Corinthians 3:2, Paul would say, "You are our epistle written in our heart, known and read of all men." &gt;&gt; For as much as you are manifestly declared to be the epistle of Christ, &gt;&gt; ministered by us, written not with ink, but with the spirit of the living God, not in tables of stone, but in fleshly tables of the heart. Well, aren't you glad for that? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; And then the prophet says, listen to this.
