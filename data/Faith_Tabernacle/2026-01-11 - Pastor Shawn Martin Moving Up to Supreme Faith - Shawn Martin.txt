Amidst a hustling, clamoring world, it's sometimes hard to hear. The voice of God speaking to my soul. But in my quiet time alone, when I approach his holy throne, his tender words fall gently on my ear. He still speaks. I know his voice. voice. Sweeter sounds never heard by mortal ear. And to think that God by his own choice would speak to me. It makes me rejoice. He still speaks. I know his voice. There are so many who still doubt that God can speak today. They laugh and mock when we say we've heard from God. Yet the still small voice of God is heard above the doubters of this world. His timeless words ring out with hope today. He still speaks. I know his voice. Sweeter sounds never heard by mortal ear. And to think that God by his own choice would speak to me. It makes me rejoice. He still speaks. I know his voice. Now in this world of confusion, there are voices everywhere. Yet to the bride only one voice speaks. A message brought with purity. Calling the elect with assurityity. That voice is still ringing loud and clear. He still speaks. I know his voice. Sweeter sounds never heard by mortal ear. And to think that God by his own choice would speak to me. It makes me rejoice. He still speaks. I know his voice. And to think that God by his own choice would speak to me. It makes me rejoice. He still speaks. I know his voice. Ah, let's see. I have heard a voice calling me out of Babylon to a higher place. There's a mountain I can live upon and I have made my choice. Jesus is my joy and liberty. Oh, Babylon will never never have its hold on me. Oh, sing it again as the brothers come for the offering. I have heard a voice calling me out of Babylon. Oh, to a higher place. There's a mountain I can live upon. I have made a choice. Jesus is my joy and liberty. Oh, Babylon will never ever have its hold on me. Amen. Brother Josiah, &gt;&gt; gracious heavenly father, Lord, how thankful we are to be in your presence once again. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh, I have made my choice or heard a voice calling me out of Babylon. Oh, to a higher place. There's a mountain I can live upon. Oh, yeah. Made my choice. Jesus is my joy and liberty. And Babylon will never never have its hold on me. Sing it as brother Doug comes. Oh, I have heard a voice calling me out of Babylon to a higher place. There's a mountain I can live upon. Oh, I have made my choice. Jesus is my joy and liberty. And Babylon will never never have its hold on me. Praise the Lord. I like to say I like everybody remember guy come here to church with me one time. He came one time with me and now he's he's down in Florida and he can't get out of the bed. He's got bone cancer and they said just just a matter of few weeks or something he can't make it, you know, and he's down in Florida. So maybe y'all could remember him in prayer. I'm not a home in this world from another place. I'm a just a passion through down here. And it's only by God's grace. I'd rather be with God's family and all my earthly friends. For the bride speaks a language the world can't understand. Yes, the bride speaks a language that the world can't understand. She speaks of a masterpiece and a predestinated plan. She talks about her theotony and the word body of the lamb. Yes, the bride speaks a language the world can't understand. The world looks on in confusion when we mention serpent seas and the kinsman redeemer. They just can't believe invisible union of the bride. They don't comprehend. For the bride speaks a language the world can't understand. Yes, the bride speaks a language that the world can't understand. She speaks of a masterpiece and a pestinated plan. She talks about her theophony and the word body of the lamb. Yes, the bride speaks a language the world can't understand. If I'm on off. There we go. Amen. Praise the Lord. If you'd like to just uh stand with me, we can go right in to the word this morning. Amen. Um certainly um enjoyed the specials today, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. and um appreciate the musicians and &gt;&gt; their dedication to um to the church to the Lord. Amen. To play for him. Amen. And we're certainly blessed by it. Amen. If you'd like to turn the book of Revelations, the 18th chapter and um before we go into the word, may we just uh bow our heads and and talk to the Lord, ask for his help. Father, we uh just come to you today in need of you, Lord, today more than we ever have before. As we see the times that we're living in and that our hearts are yearning, Lord, just for more of you to to have a greater revelation of you, Father, and a greater fellowship with you. And Father, I just pray that it would uh happen today that Lord that we would just be lifted up into higher places. And Father, with you and we just ask that your anointing will be here today as we endeavor to minister your word. I pray that you'd help me to get myself out of the way. And Father, bless your people today. And maybe those that are listening online, may may you go into their homes as well. And may they feel your presence, Father, and whatever the need would be here in the assembly this morning or out in the home, we pray, Father, that you would meet the need. We ask it in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. And amen. So we want to look at the 18th chapter and um uh going to read the first four verses says and after these things I saw another angel come down from heaven having great power and the earth was lightened with his glory and he cried mightily with a strong voice saying Babylon the great is fallen En is fallen and has become the habitation of devils and the hold of every foul clean or out every foul spirit and a cage of every unclean and hateful bird. For all nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her fornication, and the kings of the earth have committed fornication with her. The emergence of the earth are waxed rich through her, the abundance of her delicacies. And I heard another voice from heaven saying, "Come out of her, my people, that you be not partakers of her sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues." Amen. So, you can have your seats this morning. And um uh if if I have a title, it would be moving up to a supreme faith. And um I'd like to read a quote that stood out to me uh the other day. And brother Bram talks about this uh faith. Um he said the one thing that we have to move up to now is a supreme faith to what we have had. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; So I say that again. The one thing that we have have to move up to now is a supreme faith to what we had. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; You cannot have that faith until you know perfectly what you're doing. Right? &gt;&gt; He says, "When you understand like you walk and you just say,"Well, I'm going home. I'm going out and start the car." How many's ever said that, you know, um you know, I'm I'm going to uh see you at work tomorrow. you know, we got church, so we make ready, you know, uh my wife irons the clothes and things on Saturday night cuz we're going to church Sunday morning, you know, and and so it says, see, it's it's all an act of faith. Tomorrow, I'll meet you at a certain place. That's all an act of faith because you've just done it so much &gt;&gt; because it's a regular routine with you. &gt;&gt; He said, "Well, that's the way the things of God are after you have trusted him and watched him do so many things &gt;&gt; till it just becomes like a regular routine." And that's the condition I think the church will be in just before the coming of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Nothing's going, In other words, it ain't going to be caught off guard. &gt;&gt; It ain't going to be a surprise. I'm not surprised I came to church today. &gt;&gt; It's Sunday. We always go to church on Sunday. I wasn't surprised that, you know, the the the the family got up and started getting ready for church. not surprised that uh uh we all just got in in the vehicle at a at the certain time and we all come. It it's it's a thing to I'd be surprised if they didn't, you know, I and and and I know my family and you all would be surprised if I didn't show up, right? And where where's where's the pastor at? He's home. You know, he didn't want to get up this morning and I really didn't. But uh I'm here. Uh, and I woke up at 4 this morning. So, uh, uh, it's just one of those long days, you know. But, uh, uh, but it's a regular routine. &gt;&gt; And so, so, Brother Brandham is saying that's the way the things of God are after you've trusted him and watched him do so many things till it becomes just a regular routine. That's the condition I think the church will be in just before the coming of the Lord. Listen. So, the rapture will just go right on that way. It'll be just a regular routine of following scriptures and the plans of God. &gt;&gt; I think that's powerful. So, the rapture isn't going to be a surprise to us. &gt;&gt; It's not going to be just some like, "Wow, I made it." No, it's just another event. &gt;&gt; It's just another prophecy that I'm fulfilling. &gt;&gt; We're fulfilling prophecies all the time. &gt;&gt; We're living with the word all the time, right? So, it's it's just a routine. See, it would be it would be odd uh uh to to Well, it would be a shock to see you sisters out cutting your hair. But, see, it's a routine that you just keep yourself clean. It'd be a shock if if if uh one of you brothers out uh sleeping with another woman, it it would just be a surprise because the routine at we're we're following the word of God. Now, if you was a sinner and you went and done all that stuff, that's one thing. But we're in a routine of things. We're in a routine of serving God. It's a routine of worshiping. It's a routine. Can you say amen? You see, it ain't going to be a surprise on that day when we all get around the throne and we're all worshiping because that's just part of the routine that we're doing here on this earth. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; So to me, this statement is is profound. Uh because that's how he says the rapture is going to happen. It ain't going to be a surprise not to the not to the church, not to the bride, but to the world. It'll be a total surprise because they're not in the routine of following the promises of God, the word of God, THE THE PLAN OF GOD. Ain't that right? So, so now again, he says this, it isn't going to be a surprise the rapture to those who are who are in a routine of following the scriptures and the plans of God. Now, we we can only do this by the prophet's message. &gt;&gt; I think that is that's the the powerful the beauty of having a prophet in this age more than just a prophet. Amen. This was a word prophet restoring the word to us. Can you say amen? Amen. See, uh uh the word of the Lord only comes to a prophet. Ain't that right? And the prophet says, "We do have today by God's help the perfect interpretation." Everybody say, "The perfect interpretation of the word with divine vindication." So I I say this, this message is the perfect interpretation of God's word. It's been divinely vindicated. Amen. So we're not looking for a perfect interpretation. I say to you, no other man, no other ministry has the perfect interpretation outside this message of the hour. Amen. See, now every true believer in this age, Amen, has the ability and is now moving up to a supreme faith to what we have had. Say that again. Every true believer in this age has the ability. Hasn't been in the other ages, but it is today. We have the ability. And I believe we are moving up to that supreme faith than than what we've had. Ain't that right? Now notice, brother Brandham says, "You cannot have that faith until you know perfectly what you are doing." &gt;&gt; Not stumbling in the dark. &gt;&gt; Not wondering about it, not guessing at it, presuming. Can you say amen? Uh uh no question in your mind. You know perfectly what you are doing. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; I'm not questioning this message. &gt;&gt; I'm not questioning why I'm here. &gt;&gt; I'm not questioning all the things that that that we're believing. Well, we're just not questioning. We know exactly what we're doing. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? I trust that's the way you are. Amen. You trust that you sisters aren't Well, I don't know why I've got to have long hair. I wished I could cut it. I just wish this. I don't know why I've got I can't wear makeup. And I I you young people I I just don't know why we just can't go out there and just have fun and and and all these things. You know exactly you know perfectly what you're doing. You know that that that the that in the world there's trouble. &gt;&gt; The world is death. &gt;&gt; But there is a RAPTURE THAT'S ABOUT TO TAKE PLACE. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. See, so so we've heard the voice. I I uh uh thinking of that. Come out of her, my people, saith the Lord. Ain't that right? Amen. Come out of her. Amen. Babylon is fallen. Amen. I and and and I I'll be honest, Babylon has had a hold all the way down through the ages. It's uh uh uh it started and we know you you listen to the church ages and the seals and and and the uh uh uh you know how much of a strangle hold that Babylon has had upon the people and the world and all of that. But there was a mighty angel that come. There was a message that came. Can you say amen? And has declared that Babylon has fallen. A ain't that right? SO SO COME OUT OF HER, MY PEOPLE. Her power has been broken over the the bride of JESUS CHRIST. FOR GOD had determined to call a people out in this age of the Gentiles for his name. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, now, so the message has called us out of her for a rapture. &gt;&gt; Because we must know perfectly what we are doing. &gt;&gt; That's true. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; Amen. We must know perfectly. Now, we know that Babylon is is uh the Bible calls a woman. Uh uh so it's a church. church uh woman represents church in the Bible. And so it is a woman that we are uh called out of. Come out of her, my people. Ain't that right? And and in Revelation 17:5, uh this woman is called mystery Babylon. Amen. Mystery. A mystery is something not understood beyond understanding. a religious truth that no one can know only by revelation and cannot fully understand. Can you say amen? That's that's from Webster. A mystery is something that uh is not understood and and beyond understanding a religious truth that no one can know only by revelation and cannot fully understand. So this revelation, you might know uh uh God may give you a revelation about a scripture or about something and yet that can still keep on unfolding and unfolding and unfolding. A ain't that right? In other words, you'll never arrive, Amen. to where you just know everything. Amen. As long as you keep walking with God, it'll just constantly be unfolding to you and unfolding. You can listen to uh uh uh you know invisible union of the bride a thousand times and it'll still uh be unfolding and unfolding. Uh uh the message of the hour is just constantly a revelation unfolding. Ain't that right? But here is this mystery Babylon. It's not just Babylon. Amen. If if it was just Bablin, maybe uh uh the historians could understand it and and and and the archaeologist and they could dig up things and and piece everything together. But this is mystery Babylon. Amen. It cannot be understood except it be revealed to us. Ain't that right? And and this church called mystery Babylon. And we know Babylon represents confusion. that that's what it is. So So when we were called out of of of Babylon, we were called out of confusion that we might know perfectly &gt;&gt; perfectly what we're doing. Ain't that right? Amen. Sad to say, a lot of people going to church and they don't know what they're going for. Amen. They're they're claiming Christianity and have no idea the God that they're serving and have no idea what the Bible is really about. and and and and these things. See, man. But uh so this woman church, this mystery Babylon, she's a and she's a mother of harlots, a mother of churches and and and so that that whole system, religious system is is is is of whoredom and and abomination. And she's the mother of harlots uh uh of all denominations and abominations of the earth. Ain't that right? The abominations of the earth come from her. Amen. And and we know it's the Catholic Church and and and the harlots are the denominations and and all of these things. But she is also, the Bible says, we read it, the habitation of devils and the hold of every foul spirit and a cage of every unclean and hateful bird. Ain't that right? So, so in her is confusion. In this is confusion. Amen. And and confusion comes from her, out of her. Amen. And so confusion is caused by a mixture of things. things being mixed up. It's nothing pure. It's nothing uh one thing. It's it's it's it's all mixed up in a confusion. Ain't that right? So, she claims to be the church of Christ and yet her doctrines and traditions are antirist. Confusion. Ain't that right? Amen. You'd think someone Amen. claiming to be a Christian. Amen. They they'd be hot on fire for God all the way. See, but but this is a confusion cuz she's a church. She claims to be religious. She claims to be the the mother church and yet she's anti in everything she does. Antichrist. See? And and so she claiming to be the true church, but she's not. So this Catholic Church is an impersonator. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? This mystery Babylon is a a uh uh impersonator and every denomination is an impersonation of the real church. And brother Brandham says imitation only causes confusion. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? See, and so we know that harlot and is the same thing. See, and so uh a prophet would say both mother and daughters are committing adultery, spiritual adultery, committing fornications, accepting false things because of the mind and intellectuals of men. So many doctrines that people are holding today that are not scripture-based, but they are uh influenced of mankind of way way back in in Na I guess uh uh uh Rome and they started infiltrating doctrines of men and creeds and and things. And today people are living by that. FOR THE BIBLE SAYS THE WHOLE WORLD IS DRUNK BY THE WINE of her fornications. Ain't that right? Amen. See, you've got holiness people that are uh baptizing in Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. You've got, you know, you've got uh uh just your nominal people baptizing in Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. And and and most of the world baptizes that way. AND THEY'LL FIGHT you over that. Amen. And they get mad at you when you're saying that's of the devil. Well, brother Brandham said devils travel in father, son, and holy ghost. They travel in trinity. Ain't that right? See, so the prophet says the old mother and her daughters mystery Babylon. It's all mystery Babylon. It looks pretty. It looks great on the outside. Even John said he marveled when he saw this woman sitting on a a scarlet colored beast and and things. He marveled at her. And yet she was drunk with the blood of the saints. Yet she was an evil woman. But he looked at her with admiration. Ain't that right? Amen. See, so so it's not some evil thing that you're looking at. It's it's some maybe majestic thing, some uh great grand thing and uh SEEM LIKE IT IT'S ALL PUT together and seem like pleasing unto God. And yet it's mystery Babylon. And within her is nothing but confusion. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? See, and and so the prophet said, see the old mother uh and her daughter's mystery babbling. See, the Bible said here that that uh uh would be one of them mysteries that would be unfolded. Protestant protest pro prostitutes committing spiritual fornications leading people by denominations with their cup of iniquity of man-made doctrine. And notice what they're doing. Pulling them pulling the people away from the fountain filled with blood where the power of almighty God flows freely to manifest Jesus Christ. Can you say amen? We've got we, you know, the churches have become professionalism, professional preachers, professional singers, professional musicians, professional everything's professional. Amen. BUT CHRIST IS NOT THERE. IT'S not manifesting Christ. Formality to A TEA, BUT IT'S NOT manifesting Christ. Why? They have pulled the PEOPLE AWAY FROM THE FOUNTAIN FILLED WITH BLOOD that would make way for Christ to be manifested. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Sir, &gt;&gt; we know that God is not the author of confusion. Satan is the author of confusion. &gt;&gt; Amen. See, he's the one that caused Eve to be confused in the beginning. Amen. See, and and this what the prophet said, Adam's bride believed every bit of the word all but confused on one promise. Now think of that become confused ON ONE PROMISE. HOW DID SHE GET CONFUSED? She stopped to listen to that serpent. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; Amen. Satan incarnated. Amen. Himself in that serpent. and she become confused on one promise that he's the same yesterday, today and forever. Failed on one promise under the temptation of the enemy face to face. Can you say amen? So that spirit of confusion is still working today very very strong. Uh uh so much that Jesus said that the elect uh it would deceive the elect if it were possible. And the prophet said that we're living in the greatest age of deception. It is very great of deception. Amen. And the Bible talks about false brethren uh brought in unawares, false prophets, false Christs, which is false anointed ones, false apostles. Ain't that right? And and the prophet even says it'd be so close. See, he says now uh uh you go to a denomination Baptist or uh Presbyterian, that that ain't close. That ain't the deception. Amen. THEY THEY ARE SO far away removed from the spirit of God in in these days. EVEN EVEN PENTECOSTALS ARE SO FAR removed that their women are are wearing miniskirts and and and they've got preacher women preachers and and and all kinds OF THINGS. SO FAR REMOVED that that that's not the deceiving type. Amen. It's moved on up so close the prophet said the devil associates himself with the real thing. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Amen. So it's no wonder we can't just look and say, "Well, I message their Pentecostal. Oo, that's deceiving." No. No. It's so close to the real thing. Brother Brandham, I I believe typed that the Pharisees and the Sadducees as the Pentecostals and and and they hated Christ and they hated that. But then here come that that one of Judas that sat among them. Amen. So much so that when Jesus says, "One of you shall betray me." They all didn't look at Judas AND SAY, "YOU LITTLE TURKEY, I KNEW IT WAS YOU." THEY all looked and said, "Yeah, is it I? Is it me?" And there was the deceiver all that time. And the only one that knew who he was WAS JESUS. FOR THE BIBLE says he knew FROM THE BEGINNING. He was the son of predition. He was the son of the devil. Can you say amen? And yet he worked miracles. He he he uh UH SLEPT WITH THEM, ATE with them, PARTTOOK OF THE THINGS WITH THEM, WENT OUT AMONG uh wi with THOSE THAT JESUS SENT OUT to do works and all that. And yet all along he was of the devil. Can you say amen? Amen. See? Amen. So, so we find that there is that deceiving type. Amen. And and and I'm going to just be honest. I they're part of mystery Babylon. &gt;&gt; Not Not everyone that comes into this message has come out of Babylon. &gt;&gt; It's just the truth. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? For only the bride has come out of Babylon. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; See, and so we got false prophets and false teachers out in the world today and and brethren coming in unawares. Amen. Uh uh as as deceivers and and and and Paul would talk about it all and and talking about, you know, coming in in sheep wolves, coming in sheep's clothing and AND ALL THAT'S a mystery Babylon. See, and they're teaching for doctrine the commandments of men. Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; Teaching for doctrine the commandments of men, NOT STAYING WITH WHAT A PROPHET TAUGHT. &gt;&gt; That's right. and they make the word of God of no effect to the people. So, brother Ram said, "So many prophets today telling so many different things and it's getting it gets the people confused." &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Well, see, this is what causes people not to know where they stand is the confusion. &gt;&gt; When we come into the message, we, you know, I realize right quick there's a lot of confusion. Amen. &gt;&gt; Lot of confusion. You got men taking and preaching Peruia doctrine. &gt;&gt; They'll take the thing that's right and then they'll make it a total mess &gt;&gt; to where if you would stand up and preach perusia today, people would get THEIR HACKLES UP SAY YOU'RE OFF THE DOCTRINE. You're off. But if you'll teach it right, it's right there. &gt;&gt; THEY DON'T WANT TO PREACH BRIDEAGE. THEY DON'T WANT TO PREACH UH uh you know THESE THINGS. AND YOU KNOW, YOU GOT SOME THAT IF YOU EVER MENTION bride age and all, oh, you're part of this one and you're part of that one. SEE, SO IT'S GOT TO THE PLACE THAT IF YOU EVEN READ QUOTES OUT ON THE FIELD, YOU HAVE TO DEFEND IT. &gt;&gt; YOU HAVE TO GO THROUGH THE WHOLE SHEBANG OF EXPLAINING THAT YOU'RE NOT PART OF THAT. &gt;&gt; YOU'RE JUST SAYING WHAT A PROPHET SAID. &gt;&gt; YOU'RE TEACHING IT THE WAY A PROPHET TAUGHT IT. JUST BECAUSE SOMEONE GOES OFF THE off the wall awall, you know, uh on on bride age and and bride time and and all of that, that doesn't mean that we CAN'T PREACH IT. &gt;&gt; WE WOULDN'T even know ABOUT A BRIDE AGE IF A PROPHET HADN'T TAUGHT IT. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; But see, now notice this is what causes people not to know where to stand. Now listen, you know, uh uh and I I'm not I'm not meaning about any certain people. I'm just saying it's getting out there so much that even our young people are becoming fewu confused on things whether whether it is right to speak in tongues and and you know, right to do this and right to do that and and and and they just don't know where to stand. Amen. But listen, YOU'VE GOT TO KNOW perfectly what you're doing if you're going to make it in A RAPTURE. &gt;&gt; WE AIN'T GOT TIME TO TO BE DISSECTING EVERYTHING AND TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT'S TRUE. GOD SENT US A message &gt;&gt; and it's vindicated &gt;&gt; now. Brother Brandaman, speaking of the American people, he said poor the poor American people is so scrupled up in their mind, &gt;&gt; they don't know what to believe. One says this, one says that, one says this. See, isn't that the truth? Well, the poor people. He said, 'N no wonder I'm going to preach in a few nights on something like that when I get my opportunity to use the preaching service or maybe Sunday afternoon or on on these things. And the American people is the worst confused people I know of in the world, religiously speaking. Can you say amen? I wonder why that is. I wonder why that that that the people by the time the message got here that people were so messed up in their minds, so confused at what is the truth. It it I just believe it had to been the devil know that the message would be coming out of America. Amen. And he was doing everything he can. Amen. To get the people so mentally whacked, Amen. TO WHERE THEY GET THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT TO BELIEVE. WELL, we don't need to be in that condition today. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; CAN YOU SAY AMEN? WE HAVE NO EXCUSE to be in that condition. I DON'T CARE WHAT THIS SAYS AND I DON'T CARE WHAT THAT SAYS. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; SO, he says now, you know, he he brother Brand talked of of of the results he get got when he went overseas uh when they saw the discernment at work. And he says, "The first thing you know, they pile up the wheelchairs, cotss, clubs, and everything else. And they've walked on happy, rejoicing, shaking hands, and hugging one another. What's the matter? Jesus Christ has manifested himself in their midst. And they believe it." &gt;&gt; Talking about overseas. See, they believe it. No doubt in their heart. They just believe it. &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? They just believe it. And how many arguments? How many PEOPLE STILL ARGUING ABOUT the message &gt;&gt; today? &gt;&gt; So much going on. Well, it's got to be this AND GOT TO SO MUCH THAT THEY fight over the music. They fight over the songs. &gt;&gt; THEY THEY THEY FIGHT they just want to pick and tear and just shred everything. And and what they want to do is take the liberty away from the people to where they don't know what to do. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And it just all depends what church you go to on what you can believe and what you can't believe. I think if you go to a message church, you ought to just be able to believe what a prophet said. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; I I I I mean that that's the one we're following. If I go to a message church, if you come here or whether you go somewhere else, you ought to be able to worship. You ought to BE ABLE TO SHOUT. YOU OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO SAY AMEN TO EVERY QUOTE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; So he says, see, he says, see, so he said, what's the matter? Jesus Christ manifested himself in their midst and they believe it. They believe it. No doubt in their heart. They just believe it. But we, speaking of Americans, we say, "Well, now let's see. Dr. So and so said that might be mental telepathy." Well, another fellow said that might be the devil. Another one says it's fanaticism. This one says it's wildfire. I don't know what to believe. That's just where the devil's got you. &gt;&gt; Just where he has got you. Just where he wants you. See, turn loose. Everybody say, "Turn loose." &gt;&gt; Turn loose. Read the Bible. God's word be true. And every other man's word a lie. &gt;&gt; So, Americans have been taught so much theology. And he says, you know, one says, "Oh, well, it's this." The other one says it's this. And you've got that you you've got so indocated till you hardly know what to believe. So, see, he's pointing out a major problem in the church among the people. And it's the preacher's fault. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; Because they're all looking for a hierarchy. They're all looking to themselves. They're all looking to be the absolute. They're all looking for the people to come unto them. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? So they've all got their petty doctrines and their petty this and their petty that till when a real true MANIFESTATION OF OF CHRIST COMES IN IN in in the age. Amen. THAT'S OF THE DEVIL. THAT'S OF THE DE WHAT THEY were lo they they were fearful of losing their congregation. They were fearful amen of losing their MEAL TICKET. THEY THEY COULDN'T FOLLOW THAT. THEY COULDN'T FOLLOW THE TRUTH AND STILL LIVE IN A FINE house and have good retirement and and all of these things. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; So they began to attack it. See, so he says now he said, "You've got so documented till you hardly know what to believe." Brother, listen. And my sister, listen tonight. Jesus Christ was always truth. &gt;&gt; Can you say that with me? Jesus Christ is always truth. This message is Christ. That's what your prophet said. This message is Christ. So this message is the truth. And Jesus says, "I'm the way. I am the truth. I'm the life. This message is the way. This message is the truth. THIS MESSAGE IS THE LIFE." &gt;&gt; So he said, "See, Jesus Christ was always truth. his manifestation, his resurrection, HIS POWER HAS ALWAYS been the same. So don't don't LET SOMEONE TALK YOU OUT OF THE POWER OF GOD TILL YOU SIT THERE SO DEAD AND YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO TO WHERE THE WORLD HAS MORE INFLUENCE on you THAN THE CHURCH has influence to that WHERE THE SPIRIT OF GOD CAN'T EVEN have influence. See, we sit so so dried up and so dead and so Amen. because we we we've we've let ourselves become confused. Brother Brandham in speaking to the Germans in Germany he says now you people one of the smartest nations in the world surely you can believe you know why our education hinders us lots of times we've been taught everything one teaches this one this it's contrary one to the other and the poor white people and the people who lives in civilization has uh uh GOT SO MIXED UP TILL they just don't know what to believe. Yeah, &gt;&gt; that's what civilization does, right? &gt;&gt; Amen. Education and all these things. Now, Amos 8 and 11, it says, "Behold, the days come, sayeth the Lord God, that I will send a famine in the land, not a famine of bread, nor a thirst for water, but of hearing the words of the Lord." Hearing, understanding the words of the Lord. And they shall wander from sea to sea and from the north even to the east. They shall run to and fro to seek the word of the Lord and shall not find it. Now we know this is prophetic of this day. How many believes that this is prophetic of this day. Amen. See, brother Brad said we don't need bread. We got plenty of it. We got plenty to eat, plenty clothes to wear, nice homes to live in and everything. But there's a famine. There is a famine for the hearing of the word of God. A man won't know what to believe. &gt;&gt; He's in a famine. &gt;&gt; He said, "You're all confused. ONE SAYS THIS, ONE SAYS THAT, ONE SAYS THIS, ONE SAYS SOMETHING ELSE." BASE YOUR THOUGHTS ON THUS SAYETH THE LORD, AND GOD WILL CONFIRM IT. Another place he said, "We have been drugged through this and drugged through that and drugged through everything until honest the poor little people can't understand what to believe." &gt;&gt; And that's sad because it's happening in the message. &gt;&gt; You'd think every message preacher would just point you to the message and say, "Just believe the message." Right? &gt;&gt; But that ain't the case. &gt;&gt; They want to steer you away from certain quotes. &gt;&gt; They want to steer you away from certain years. Well, it's only 63 on that you need to really listen to. Everything else was just Brother Brandham's opinion. Where's that at? &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; You know, God, that picture was taken in what? 56 &gt;&gt; 50 &gt;&gt; 50. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; It's earlier than that. That was not in 63, &gt;&gt; in 50 to let the people know this is what I sent to you. &gt;&gt; THIS IS THE MESSAGE I SENT TO YOU. &gt;&gt; AND and it's not to be UH UH DISSECTED. I you know, and you just have to forgive me. It's just kind of a burden on my heart today. Um but you know, I remember when I first come into the message, and I I believe I've told you before, we went and heard a certain brother give his testimony. He was with brother Brandham and stuff but in in in one he made a statement about the church age book that brother Brandham told him personally now we didn't understand everything at that time but brother Bram told him personally that the church age ought to be burned and so he said well brother Bram you want me go get them and burn them no you know well what that done is it planted a seed in my mind &gt;&gt; right And so I'll be honest, I had a hard time for ye for years really getting into the church age book &gt;&gt; because that was always in my mind. Brother Bram said it needed to be burned. Brother Bram said it needed to be burned. So when I was actually up in Erie, Pennsylvania pastoring up there, uh brother had been in a church for years and they him and his family left and started coming here uh to our church and after a little bit he said you know he and I never told the people anything. I always promoted the book, but I'm just telling you it was always in my mind. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And and so, uh, he came to me. He said, you know, brother Johnny, he says, you know, our way we've been taught for years is that the the church age book a ain't inspired. It's Lee Vale's book. Like, well, really? So, that's that's odd, you know. So, I kind of told him my story and um I said, you know, I've always struggled with it, you know, uh not even when I'd read it, you know, it was always there in my mind, it ought to be burned. It ought to be burned. And uh so we were uh that weekend we were having Brother Wayne Lawson up to to preach and I said, "I tell you what, brother." I said, uh, you know, Brother Wayne's will be coming and, uh, let's not say a word to no one. I'm not going to say a word to anyone. And, um, we'll see what God has to say about it, you know, cuz I said, I want to be right. And he said, well, I do, too. So, I said, "All right." So, I said, "I won't mention nothing." And uh so one one of them services, Brother Wayne's up there preaching and he just just flipped, man. You know, totally out of his context of his sermon. And he said, you know, he says, "Some people say that this church age book is Lev's book or that it ought to be burned and that it ain't nothing." He says, "That is a lie of the devil." Right. &gt;&gt; And buddy, he starts, you know, he's got a mind on him and he starts quoting quotes, you know, and right then that spirit left. &gt;&gt; That thing left and it did that other bro. I've never had a problem since. Never had that even in my mind that this thing ought to be burned or whatever. and and it was a spirit, but it it was a spirit by somebody putting just saying words and it put it on me. You understand what I'm saying? See, and and then I realized, no wonder brother Brown say what I say on tapes. Say what I say on tape. I don't want to hear anyone else's uh version of what brother Brandham told them. IF HE TOLD THEM SOMETHING AND IF IT'S NOT WHAT he lived and NOT WHAT HE SAID, I I ain't listening to it. You understand what I'm saying? It's got to be. Why? There's too many confusion out here. And the only way we're going to get in a RAPTURE IS MOVE UP TO SUPREME FAITH. And that's the only way we can do it is we know perfectly what we ARE DOING. WE AIN'T GOT TIME to listen to voices. WE AIN'T GOT TIME TO LISTEN TO WHAT THIS has to say and this HAS TO SAY AND THEN REASON IT ALL TOGETHER. JUST GIVE ME WHAT BROTHER BAM SAID, WHAT HE TAUGHT and let it stay there. You know, one man said, "Well, HE CONTRADICTS HIMSELF." YOU KNOW WHAT? THERE THE BIBLE CONTRADICTS. If you really want to look at it, Peter uh uh the four gospels, IF YOU GO JUST READ THE FOUR GOSPELS, THEY GOT DIFFERENT ACCOUNTS on on it all. &gt;&gt; THEY GOT FOUR DIFFERENT ACCOUNTS OF WHAT WHAT Jesus did. And in some places, it's a totally different story. They're talking of the same story and totally two different stories. &gt;&gt; Does that make the Bible the word of God of none effect? ABSOLUTELY NOT. THERE'S A MESSAGE THERE. &gt;&gt; And and and that's what I want to bring to you today IS THE MESSAGE. AMEN. You can look at brother Brand's words and he'll say this and he may say that and he may say that. But the message, &gt;&gt; there is a message from beginning to end. Amen. That's clicked together. It all comes together. &gt;&gt; Even God seems to contradict himself. Thank you. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; HE TELLS ISRAEL NOT to have any image &gt;&gt; and then he tells Moses to raise up an image, &gt;&gt; a brazen serpent. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; I mean, THERE'S THERE'S ALL KINDS OF THINGS. BUT IF YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND, THE CARNAL MIND WILL JUST MAKE IT AND SAY, "THIS IS A CONFUSING BOOK." &gt;&gt; BUT WHEN IT'S REVEALED, BROTHER BRAND SAID, YOU'LL SEE CHRIST IN EVERY BIT OF IT. AMEN. &gt;&gt; It's not to be read LIKE A NEWSPAPER. IT'S NOT TO BE UNDERSTOOD BY THE CARNAL MIND. AND THIS MESSAGE IS NOT TO BE CAR UH IT WASN'T A CARNAL MIND THAT CAME AND SAID COME OUT OF HER MY PEOPLE. IT WAS A revelated word that came to us. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Come on now. Understand. That's right. You know how many people have lived in that that have well you it's manifested now there's been people that preached this message guys that preached this message for years and now walking away from it cuz they never understood in the first place. &gt;&gt; They tried to follow it by a carnal mind. &gt;&gt; You can't do that. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; How many people have walked away Amen. uh and and they totally walk away from it because of the carnal mind. They tried to look at this thing through a carnal mind, through a carnal understanding. There ain't no way you're going to look at the Bible or this message by a carnal understanding. Jesus wasn't worried about an intellectual message or he would have had an intellectual man preach. BUT HE HAD A SEVENTH GRADE educated Kuckian &gt;&gt; bring this MESSAGE THAT COULDN'T GIVE ALL THE INTELLECTUAL WORDS THAT ALL THESE OTHER INTELLECTUAL PREACHERS COULD GIVE. &gt;&gt; BUT IT WASN'T ABOUT INTELLECTUAL. IT WAS ABOUT A REVELATION. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Come out of her my people. See, so a man can't come higher into that supreme faith if he doesn't know perfectly where he stands. &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I believe it was brother Brandham. I'm pretty sure I read it, but he said confusion just paralyzes faith. &gt;&gt; It just paralyzes faith because if you're if you're in a state of confusion, you don't know what to believe. You don't know who to believe. You don't know. You know where you're going. &gt;&gt; Well, see, uh, the rapture is is it's going to it's going to take the greatest faith, more faith ever &gt;&gt; to get in a rapture. &gt;&gt; Do you believe that &gt;&gt; more faith ever, more faith, perfect faith? He says in one place, I know one brother and I I'm I'm sure he meant well, but he's told convin, you know, a few months ago told me that brother Bram did not have perfect faith. I'm like, oh my word. Now, I never heard that one before, but I thought, my God, if he didn't have perfect faith, where do I stand? &gt;&gt; But he believed this message so much. &gt;&gt; Hello. &gt;&gt; He had that perfect faith. &gt;&gt; He stood on this message regardless of what everybody else said. &gt;&gt; He believed it come from an angel. He believed THAT HE WAS HE WASN'T OUT OF HIS MIND. HE BELIEVED THAT THAT WAS THE PILLAR OF FIRE, THAT HE WASN'T JUST SEEING THINGS. He believed it. CAN YOU SAY AMEN? EVERY PROMISE HE BELIEVED IT AND HE EXPECTS US TO BELIEVE IT. GOD EXPECTS US TO BELIEVE THIS MESSAGE THE WAY THE PROPHET believed this message. &gt;&gt; A perfect faith. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Now when God sends a message messenger with a message, see he thoroughly thoroughly vindicates his man and his message. &gt;&gt; Why? Why would God vindicate it? Now this message has this message is the most thoroughly vindicated message. &gt;&gt; More vindicated than any other message that's come to this earth. &gt;&gt; You believe that? &gt;&gt; Bible never talks about how Moses Noah was vindicated. Never talks about him. You know, he didn't have sign of Messiah. &gt;&gt; He didn't have discernment. He it didn't tell doesn't even say him working any kind of miracles. &gt;&gt; But the people would perish if they didn't believe him. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; He's the one with the message. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But in this age, it's been so thoroughly vindicated. Even science took a picture of it. &gt;&gt; It's been scientifically vindicated. Right. &gt;&gt; Scripturally vindicated, &gt;&gt; supernaturally vindicated. &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; VINDICATED IN SO MANY WAYS. &gt;&gt; Because he doesn't want his people to be confused. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; And notice, he's going to judge the world. God's going to judge the world by his what? His word. &gt;&gt; That's what a prophet said. His word. But it'll be the word that he sent by his prophets. &gt;&gt; The people in Noah's day will be judged by the word of that prophet. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; The people in Moses day will be judged by the word that Moses the prophet brought. &gt;&gt; The people in Elijah's day will be judged by his message &gt;&gt; which was the word of God sent to them. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? That's right. &gt;&gt; So anytime that God sends a prophet thoroughly vindicates them to where the people who refuse to listen to him, they perish for rejecting the prophet's message &gt;&gt; and they will be judged by that message and their actions to it. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Now, God didn't just send another prophet on the scene to us in this day. H &gt;&gt; he sent to us the prophet of Malachi 4 &gt;&gt; scripturally &gt;&gt; spoken of this day and he never promised to send another prophet after that. &gt;&gt; How many people wanted to be a prophet after brother Brandham? &gt;&gt; So many people want to be another prophet, another minister, another messenger. &gt;&gt; God never vindicated it and God never promised it. Can you say amen? God didn't promise to send another earthly messenger to the earth after the seventh angel messenger came with his message. &gt;&gt; According to the scriptures, THERE'S ONLY SEVEN EARTHLY messengers sent to THE GENTILE DISPENSATION. CAN YOU SAY AMEN? &gt;&gt; AND THAT SEVENTH ANGEL IS THE PROPHET OF MALACHI 4. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? How many believes that? &gt;&gt; Cuz there's just now going around that brother just said and y'all know him. Brother just just said that the Holy Spirit led him and told him that that that brother Brandham is not the seventh angel messenger. &gt;&gt; Well, you know, uh someone someone asked brother Brandham this question. Is the seventh angel as spoken of of Revelations 10 the same person as Elijah of Malachi 4? Now there they specifically ask him this question. He says yes it's the same person. &gt;&gt; Revelations 10 is the se angel's message uh which the seventh angel messenger of the seventh an uh ch seventh church age is Malachi 4. &gt;&gt; So when a man is telling you that brother Brandham is not the seventh angel, he's also telling you brother Brandham is not the prophet of Malachi 4. NOW, YOU GOT TO COME OUT OF THE CONFUSION. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he says, "I guarantee you your p," you know, he's talking to visitors in his church. He says, "I guarantee you your pastor would never teach you this." He said, "But if you understand what I'm telling you, it's the Holy Ghost that have led you this or spoke this to you. I'd say it's a spirit of confusion." &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. You know, we wouldn't even know what the seventh angel was outside this message. &gt;&gt; It's the message, brother Brandham's message telling us who he was. &gt;&gt; He he, you know, and that's what his critics criticized him of. Oh, they they loved his ministry. They they said he was anointed. He was meek. He was all humble and all these things. Nothing no ministry like him. But he kind of just felt like he was that Malachi 4 prophet. Well, of course he did. You know who told him? An angel. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And with perfect faith, HE WOULD TELL THE PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD THAT THIS IS MALACHI 4. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; I believe. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Do you believe it? &gt;&gt; When they asked him that question, he didn't have to say, "Well, I don't know. &gt;&gt; I don't know. I I I'll give you, you know, I I don't know." &gt;&gt; No. He had perfect faith. because an angel put them scriptures together for him. &gt;&gt; The angel of God put Revelations 10 and Malachi 4 and connected it for him. &gt;&gt; It wasn't just a carnal mind putting scriptures together. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hope this all right. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; So now, Brother Bram said, "The seventh angel is a man." &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And he is to bring a message from God. And his message and ministry is going to finish the mystery of God as declared to his servant, the prophets. God is going to treat this last messenger as a prophet because he is a prophet. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. You know, brother Brandham goes to show us and he he goes to Jezebel. Now, Jezebel, who prophesied uh uh Jezebel's doom? Elijah. &gt;&gt; And he says, Elijah said, "In the portion of Jezrael shall the dogs eat Jezebel, the prophet Elijah did, the first Elijah." And that's exactly what happened when Elijah went off the scene. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; You can read about it in 2 Kings 9, chapter 9, and talks talks about it. And and so uh there in the 35th verses, and and they went to bury her, but they found no more of her than the skull, the feet, and the palms of her hands. Wherefore they came again and told him, and he said, "This is the word of the Lord, which he spake by his servant Elijah the Tishbite, saying, In the portion of Jezrael shall the dogs eat the flesh of Jezebel, &gt;&gt; and the carcass of Jezebel shall be as dung upon the face of the field in the portion of Jezrael, so that they shall not say, "This is Jezebel." &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; So then you go in Revelations 2 and 20. God likens the harlot church system, the her harlots, uh, uh, her daughters, all that to that of Jezebel. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? And, and the same time, you can read about it. Revelations 2:18 through 23 there. See, and and so this Jezebel spirit now is in the church. Same same thing. It was it was in the natural Jezebel in the days of Elijah the Tishbite. But now this Jezebel spirit is in the church in a spiritual form. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And Revelations 19:17, notice, "And I saw uh an angel standing in the sun, and he cried with a loud voice, saying to all the fowls that fly in the midst of heaven, come and gather yourselves together unto the supper of the great God, that you may eat the flesh of kings, and the flesh of captains, and the flesh of mighty men, the flesh of horses, and of them that sit on them, and the flesh of all men, both free and bond, both small and great. I saw the beast and the kings of the earth and their armies gathered together to make war against him that sat on the horse and against his army. And the beast was taken and with him the false prophet and wrought miracles before or that wrought miracles before him with which he deceived them that had the mark received the mark of the beast and them that worshiped the image his image. These both were cast alive into a lake of fire burning with brimstone. And the remnant were slain with the sword of him that sat upon the horse, which sword proceeded out of his mouth, and all the fowls were filled with their flesh. &gt;&gt; In other words, devoured them. &gt;&gt; See? So, so now Brother Brian's saying this is exactly the same Jezebel spirit upon these people. It's that that's going to be the end of them just like it was the that that that first Jezebel. &gt;&gt; For he says to those who do not believe that this last messenger to the church age is Elijah the prophet, a man anointed in that line. Watch after death of this last church age. You notice what happens after death their dead bodies are destroyed by wild beasts. You know that that's true. like theirs had the type of Jezebel. He feeds them to the beast and birds. He said watch over here see of uh in in book of revelations kill with the sword and death and beast of the earth. The Jezebel church her actually body is to be eaten by fowls and beasts of the earth. Just exactly like Ahab and Jezebel was in the natural. So are they to be in the spiritual form of a church. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? See, and it comes after the last messenger, which is Elijah the prophet. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; See, and so, Brother Brandon would tell us this last messenger, the seventh angel, uh, the prophet of Malachi 4 is the messenger of truth. Everybody say the messenger of truth. &gt;&gt; To the elect &gt;&gt; and wordbornne brideorn &gt;&gt; may not be the MESSENGER OF TRUTH TO THE WORLD but it IS THE MESSENGER OF TRUTH TO THE elect and the wordborn bride. &gt;&gt; No other man will or has ever had a ministry like brother Brandhams. &gt;&gt; That's true. &gt;&gt; And he'll never be vindicated like brother Brandhams. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Now notice, and I won't keep you too much longer, but those who are going in the rapture, the us we're going in a rapture are getting in the routine. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Of following the scriptures and the plans of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We've come out of confusion. &gt;&gt; Babylon no longer has a hold on us. That's right. &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad for that? &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; AND NOW WE'RE FOLLOWING IN step routine following the scriptures and the plans of God. &gt;&gt; It reminds me of of what Elijah told his servant there in 2 Kings 4:29. He said, "Go gird up thy loins and take my staff in thy hand and go thy way." talking about, you know, when that woman came up and had that dead son. If thou meet any man, salute him not. If any man salute thee, answer him not again and lay my staff on the face of that child. Now, Brother Brandham, in several different in places, he's he's reading after reading this scripture or talking about it, he said, "That's the trouble with the church today with this message. They're stopping, chatting along the road, little gatherings, social parties, card parties, picnics, want to, you know, what? Just want to love everybody. &gt;&gt; Sewing circles, just just rub shoulders with everybody. I mean, after all, &gt;&gt; go ahead. &gt;&gt; God is love and we must be the people of love. &gt;&gt; What about standing against the persecution? Yeah. &gt;&gt; What about standing for what's right &gt;&gt; and not being a jellyfish &gt;&gt; or not being one of those uh uh ch one of those things that you get it on the grass, it turns green. You get it on a rock, it turns the color of the rock, &gt;&gt; a chameleon. &gt;&gt; We're not to be chameleons. &gt;&gt; We're to run the race. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? See, he says, "Too much of the world has entered in." He said, 'We haven't got no time to fool around. The message is urgent. PEOPLE ARE DYING. &gt;&gt; LET'S GO FORWARD. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Another place it says, if anybody speaks, you don't even speak to them. If the devil says, "Hey, you know what you're feeling?" DON'T EVEN SPEAK to him. Just keep going. The devil, you know, the devil says, "Well, but you know what? You know, so and so when they got the Holy Ghost, you remember they almost LOST THEIR MIND. DON'T EVEN SPEAK TO HIM. Don't that devil, RIGHT? JUST KEEP GOING. YOU DON'T KNOW ABOUT SO AND SO. IT'S YOU AND GOD. &gt;&gt; JUST keep going. &gt;&gt; I'll be honest. When I first come in the message, you know, I had I had ministers even tell me now, you don't want to get too deep &gt;&gt; because, you know, everybody seems to go off the deep end when you start really studying the message. So, again, there become a fear. &gt;&gt; All right. like, "Oh no." &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; You know, I'm I'm kind of scared. You know what, brother Brandham? And and this is all paraphrased here because I I wished I had the quote before me, but Brother Terry, you would know what I'm talking about. But you know, Brother Brandham says, "You don't have to worry about going off the deep end. If you've got a hunger to know more about God, God will show it to you." &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; I heard one brother say uh actually I was listening to his sermon this morning and it was just really good. But he he uh he said, "If you don't study this message and you don't stay in this message, you're going to be left behind." &gt;&gt; Think about it. &gt;&gt; And and that don't mean more of the rapture. It just means God's progressing. &gt;&gt; We're progressing. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And and as we've said before and and and brother Terry, you would know more than I would. Uh you you and and you elders have been in in the mess way more than I have, longer than I have. But but you know, I heard you know that when right when brother Brandham left the scene, everybody was just happy that God sent a prophet. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And they would just tell the stories, you know, God sent a prophet. God sent a prophet. They didn't even have a clue of what really that he taught. &gt;&gt; That's true. And then one brother started really getting into the medicine. Then he got into the thunders and he got into all this stuff. And so so one elder brother uh Ed uh um Ed Hunter he told me he says you know he says we just we he was there and he said we just didn't really know what the message was about. He said but when they started teaching the thunders and all that we knew that just couldn't be all right. So it got us to really start searching the message for ourselves. And and now we're looking at it. We've come a long ways from what they were. And and I pray to God that my children will if God would terry that they'll come along more. BRING THIS MESSAGE on further. And it ain't going to be BY INTELLECTS. IT'S GOING TO BE BY A REVELATION OF WHAT A PROPHET TAUGHT. &gt;&gt; YOU don't have TO GO OFF OUT IN THE DEEP END. JUST STAY WITH THE MESSAGE. GOD WILL TAKE YOU FURTHER THAN YOU'LL EVER DREAMED. Can you say amen? I have found that, you know, there there's time, you know, I I have studied the message. I've read the books and I've read that and then I'll pick up a book or I'll turn on a tape and and I'll hear BROTHER RAM SAY SOMETHING. I NEVER HEARD HIM SAY THAT BEFORE. &gt;&gt; BUT WHAT HAPPENED? IT JUST STICKS OUT IN MY MIND. &gt;&gt; GOD'S TAKING ME FURTHER down the road. Right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; See, so we're not JUST FOLLOWING A MAN. WE'RE NOT IN CONFUSION. &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. &gt;&gt; We're advancing NOT BY INTELLECT. WE'RE ADVANCING BY REVELATION. &gt;&gt; And it's becoming a routine. You know what the Bible says? They that are led by the spirit of God are the sons of God. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? Led by the spirit. Led by the spirit. Amen. When you're playing them, let God Amen. LET THE SPIRIT OF GOD START leading you. Start bringing you into greener pastures. Can you say amen? Amen. And not he can lead you to se someone to talk to someone. If you get so sensitive to God, get out of the carnal. I I've just been praying for myself. God, get me get out of my stupid carnal ways. &gt;&gt; I want to just be so godlike, so Christlike. I want to be so close to God. &gt;&gt; You know what I mean? that that when God wants me to do something, I'll be just right there to hear it &gt;&gt; and I can do it. &gt;&gt; You know what I mean? &gt;&gt; When he when you can't go to sleep, have you ever been there? &gt;&gt; I'm there a lot. You can't, you know, you wake up, you only get four hours sleep or whatever, but but you know, like the other day, I I just I I I woke up, I don't know, 3, 4 in the morning, and I really was trying to go back to sleep, but something just come on my heart and people just started coming on my heart, and I I just got out of bed and went down in the living room and just started praying for these, well, for the church here and for different ones And you know, I thought, well, God, if that's why you woke me up for, I'll be glad to stay awake. &gt;&gt; You understand what I'm saying? &gt;&gt; God God can lead us. God God can direct us. &gt;&gt; And and God, you know, we're so close to the the coming of the Lord that that that we want to make every minute of our time count. &gt;&gt; We want everything that we do count for the kingdom of God. And if we'd be so sensitive to his spirit, God God could put us on the path. You know, you hear what brother Bram says, you know, when he in the message being led by the spirit, you know, talking about how that God would lead him and and he's at a restaurant, you know, and they're there at a certain time and someone comes up says, "Oh, brother Brandham, I was told God told me to come to this restaurant. I thought I was going to miss you." and and and here you are, you know, and and they're I think they're eating and brother Brandham just gets up and he just takes off and one of the ladies that was there asked me where's he going just be he knows what he's doing you know he goes out to a certain street corner and as he's there some ladies or some man brother Brandham you know so nice to meet you know says well I've got this problem I got that problem and God just told me to start walking well God what was it brother Brandham said it's people being led by the spirit and before you know it, they had a policeman out there holding back traffic because they're having a prayer line in the middle of a street because people are led by the spirit. And we ought to be led by the spirit. &gt;&gt; Led by the spirit. WHEN YOU'RE LISTENING TO TAPES, LET THAT SPIRIT OF GOD LEAD YOU INTO GREATER UNDERSTANDING, GREATER REVELATION. CAN YOU SAY AMEN? BECAUSE IT'S A ROUTINELY OF FOLLOWING GOD'S REVEALED WORD, GOD'S SCRIPTURES AND AND HIS PLAN. &gt;&gt; That's how the raptures are going to be. It's just a well Enoch walked with God till he was not for God took him. &gt;&gt; 500 years walking with God. Walking with God. AND THAT DAY WAS NO DIFFERENT. &gt;&gt; PRAISE the Lord. &gt;&gt; Just walking with God. Yeah. &gt;&gt; And that's the way the rapture is going to be. Ain't going to be anything different. &gt;&gt; You ain't going to go from one carnal nutad all of a sudden spiritual and and I'm ready. &gt;&gt; No. Routine day following scriptures. Following the plan of God. Getting more godlike. Getting more God in your thought thinking. CAN YOU SAY AMEN? CASTING DOWN REASONINGS. CASTING DOWN THOUGHTS THAT DON'T AGREE WITH THIS WORD. ARE YOU with me? &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; So we see see now people are listening to too much negativity, listening to too many other voices, listening to voice of discouragement, voice of pleasure, voice of deception. Now you know what prophet said. The voices are drowning out the voice of God. Can you say amen? So there's only one voice. Everybody say one voice. There's only one voice that we are to listen to. And Jesus said, "My sheep know my voice, and a stranger they will not follow." &gt;&gt; If you notice, the spirit speaks to each age, saying that he that hath an ear, let him hear what the spirit saith to the church. Now, I'm going to hurry up here, but well, I'm just going to move on because I know you know these things, but I do want to get into a point. Brother Brand talked about the symphony. And if you've ever been to a symphony, it's u I've only been once and uh there in Tulsa and uh we had gotten we had just before we moved up here actually uh we had gotten Faith um in touch with a violinist and this lady played in the Philarmonic uh symphony and so she gave us we got free pass to go to the symphony. never been to one. And so when you're there, you know, and you get there early, everybody's practicing and it's it's it hurts your ears if you're if you you know, I this is rough, you know, and I told uh my wife said, "Man, this is horrible, you know, cuz they're all playing their own part and it's it's all whack." And uh well then you see the director, he opens the door and here he comes and and just everybody hushes and they all put their, you know, they all line up, you know, whatever, getting posture and he stands on that podium and he looks at him and they're all looking at him and then he has his little stick and he starts doing this and before you know it, you starting hearing the sweetest sound. Well, Brother Bram describes this symphony that in the symphony they're telling a story. It's a it's a story that they're telling and he talks about Peter and whatever uh Peter and the wolf &gt;&gt; and he describes that as all being told in a story when you know like when the uh when the wolf is growling they've got some instrument there to kind of depict that and when you know the wood pecker maybe uh or whatever then the drummer you know he's got little thing to make it sound like a woodpecker or whatever, but they're all telling the story. And and and now, Brother Brandham would tell us and and he says, "Now, anyone who knows the story that's reading it off of a paper can hear that symphony and how it's acting out that out, the drama playing it out. They know every change. &gt;&gt; They can look at it here and see the change." came down. See, now he says, "And those though WHO DOESN'T KNOW THE STORY LINE, THEY JUST SHOW UP and and and they just got there and and they don't know. They just hearing this, they just think it's all racket. See, it's racket to them. See?" Well, Jesus's ministry was nothing but a bunch of racket to the Pharisees and Sadducees. But those that had known what was going TO HAPPEN, THEY KNEW THEY THEY COULD LOOK AT THE SCRIPT AND LOOK AND SEE THAT SOMETHING'S CHANGED &gt;&gt; in the symphony. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Nathaniel knew what the music sheet was saying for he said, "Thou art the king of Israel." See, I know it. I know who you are. REBRAHAM SAID, "HOW DID HE KNOW IT?" He was elected. The Alexi knows it always through every age. They know it. The woman at the well recognized the change in the music FOR SHE SAID, "COME AND SEE A MAN WHO'S TOLD ME EVERYTHING I'VE EVER DID. ISN'T THIS THE MESSIAH?" &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. &gt;&gt; SO, Brother Brown said, "You've got to understand what it is. It's all done by signs and motions, but it's it acts out a drama in this symphony." He said, "We notice the the only one that understands a symphony is the composer. And those who are interested in knowing it, knows it changes, knows what takes place. The composer knows every move from the end to the beginning, from the beginning to the end." He said, "Did you know that the one who wrote it up, he composes this? He knows every little junction. He knows every junction. So does the director have to do. He he because he directs it. Ain't that right? So he says the director and the composer has to be in the same spirit. &gt;&gt; If the director isn't in the same spirit of the composer, he cannot act it out because it's all done by signs. And if the SIGN DOESN'T VINDICATE IT, HOW IS THE MUSICIANS GOING TO PLAY IT? &gt;&gt; He said that's why the minister in the word of God, God's great symphony, he said he has been playing since the dawn of time. The minister at the word has to not look over here and say, "Well, I believe this ought to be and and you ought to make it this way." SEE, HE'S GOT TO go the way the sheet music says it. &gt;&gt; THAT'S THE WAY THE GOSPEL HAS GOT TO BE PREACHED, THE WAY THE WORD says it. &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; So, we can see that that you know that the bride, this is where the bride is coming to. She's getting in symphony. She's She's starting to play her part. This is where we're at. We know what we're doing. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; So, here 1963, Brother Bram said, "If we would only know what day we're living in, there wouldn't be so much confusion about this message and about the scriptures that we're trying to bring to the people. If the people only understand that we are at the end time, &gt;&gt; LOOK AT THE WORD AND SEE WHERE WE'RE LIVING. THEN YOU SEE then you can see pennies what they do but you can see those who are glistening watching and knows the word and watching for these signs to happen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; So you get you get you become part of that symphony. Amen. Through the baptism of the Holy Ghost. How many believes that? &gt;&gt; You receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost. You're not going to become against the word. You're going to fall in line with that word. See, it becomes a routine to you. Every day is a routine of following the scriptures and the plans of God. You believe that? &gt;&gt; Now, brother Brandham in this and I thought it was important that I do want to bring and I'm skipping a lot, but he says, "Stay in the symphony. Stay in God's word no matter how hard it is." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's true, &gt;&gt; brothers and sisters. Life is hard. &gt;&gt; And the way we have taken is a hard way. &gt;&gt; Isn't that what he said to to to brother Brandon? Because thou hast chosen the hard path. &gt;&gt; The harder way. &gt;&gt; This is the harder way that we've chosen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I don't think we ought to be miserable. I That's If you're miserable, you've not caught the revelation of the message. See, but it is a hard time, a hard way. &gt;&gt; But he says, NO MATTER HOW HARD IT IS, STAY right with it. Wherever God is beating. &gt;&gt; Sometimes he causes trouble to break the bands to set you free. He does that. You say, "Well, I don't know what what what I do." He does. &gt;&gt; What difference? See, you're just playing the part. He is the one that's got you in his hand. He directs you. Right. Another place he says many people ask me why must these things happen and and maybe you're in this situation in the you know I know you know different ones struggling in your physical body others are struggling maybe in discouragement and maybe in just in life trying to you younger couples maybe trying to find your way and and and you're working hard and just seems like it just you you know you're beating not getting anywhere. &gt;&gt; Go ahead. &gt;&gt; Brother Bram says you know many people ask me why must these things happen? Why did this happened to me? Why did I start and this happened? I had this trouble and this upset me here and I lost this here. He says sometimes I've asked why. Why? When I was just a young minister, first started out, why did God take my wife right out from under me and take my baby right from beneath me, right beneath my heart, &gt;&gt; why did he do that? Well, I didn't know then, but I do now. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I just held my hand in his and kept trusting. &gt;&gt; That's what you've got to do. Every one of you. &gt;&gt; This preacher's got to do this. &gt;&gt; Sometime we don't know tomorrow. I I don't know. I wished I had answers for you. &gt;&gt; I wished I had answers for my own complications. &gt;&gt; I wished I did. I you know, and I I know we got answers in the message and all that, but you understand. I in other words, I WISHED I COULD SAY be done with it and you're all okay and and we're all, you know, troublefree and trial free. AND &gt;&gt; I I WISH I COULD &gt;&gt; I wish they could just go by the hand physically and grab your children and bring them in to the message &gt;&gt; and say, "Stay there." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Start living for God. &gt;&gt; I can't. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I I wished I had the answers or the capability of of of these things. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Making life easier. &gt;&gt; Yeah. But brother Brandham says, "See, I just held my hand in his and kept trusting." And that's what you got to do. &gt;&gt; That's what you GOT TO DO. &gt;&gt; HE KNOWS EVERY JUNCTION. &gt;&gt; HE KNOWS THE rhythm and when it must take place. &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. &gt;&gt; HE KNOWS WHAT IT TAKES TO MOLD YOU. &gt;&gt; He knows what kind of material he's going to use. &gt;&gt; Amen. See the backside of the desert sometimes where God molds righteous men into sages and prophets. That's where men are beat out. Men are beat out in the word when they got all kind of creed and stuff in them. Let them come to THE WORD AND GOD BEATS IT RIGHT OUT OF THEM and molds it right into this into the great symphony of his word. Then they see the word moving on. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; God knows when the rhythm of it has to change. HE KNOWS HOW THE RHYTHM GOES. I DON'T KNOW HOW IT GOES, BUT HE KNOWS. &gt;&gt; HE KNOWS HOW IT GOES. I DON'T. But I look at it here and I say, "Well, it's just coming." &gt;&gt; And I got to tell you, the rhythm's going to change for you. &gt;&gt; You just got to stay steady. That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He says, "Many are the afflictions of the righteous, but God deliverth them out him out of them all." &gt;&gt; See, God has moved through history with the rhythm of the promise of his word in each age. In the same rhythm, making his word and that's how God moved through the h THROUGH HISTORY FROM ALL THE way from Genesis to Revelation. He has moved through history with his word. That's right. WITH THE RHYTHM OF THE POWER OF THE HOLY SPIRIT, vindicating his word to the elected. Remember, he's never been able to touch the outside church. It's only the elected. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, he says, remember, it's all done by a sign. We see the time we're living in by the by the sign we're living in. So, we know what si the symphony does today. It's separating time. Everybody say it's separating time. &gt;&gt; TAKING THE LIGHT FROM THE DARKNESS. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; He says, let's say it together so you won't forget. It's taking the light from the darkness. &gt;&gt; He says, let's say it again. It's taking the light from the darkness. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; If the musicians will come, &gt;&gt; praise the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham, I wish I thought I had the quote here, but apparently I don't. But he said it's like in the symphony, if you notice and you're hearing that symphony, sometimes it comes loud and then it drops back slow, soft, he said, but it's all part of the story, &gt;&gt; he said. And that's the way it is with your life. Your life has its ups and its downs. It has its high moments and it has its low moments. But it's God working something out in your life through this for the symphony. It's your life beating with the rhythm. Not everything is high high volume. &gt;&gt; NOT EVERYTHING OF YOUR LIFE IS JUST A FORCEFUL THING. Sometimes you're laidback and you don't know what to do. And maybe you're not getting much in life. And maybe it to you it may seem like you're not being much of an influence to others and God's got you kind of hit back and you don't know. You just you kind of question about your ministry. You're wondering about your life and you're wondering about if God's but no, it's it's part of the symphony. It's God just just doing something. But remember, the rhythm's going to change. Every the THE MUSIC'S GOT TO CHANGE in your life as it has the church through all these years. You just got to hold his hand. Hold his hand and trust him. Keep following the scriptures. Let your life be routine. FOLLOWING THE SCRIPTURES, FOLLOWING HIS PLAN. He knows what he's doing with your life. He knows what to do. I don't, but he does. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? And I know Satan would love for us to get discouraged and just throw up our hands and say, "Why?" He can't. You just got to keep pressing on. I'm part of the symphony. &gt;&gt; I'm part of the symphony. &gt;&gt; And I may be used just a little part, but that's okay. It's got to go. It's got to be part of it. They can't do it without me. And and the prophet said, you know, Paul would even say it and the prophet used it for our age. They without us cannot be made perfect. &gt;&gt; Just let your life be part of the symphony routinely yielding to God. Don't listen to the devil. Don't listen to all the confusion. Just be meek and be humble before the Lord. Say, "Father, I love you. I know you got it all worked out. I trust you. I may not see beyond the end of my nose, but I trust you. You're faithful. I will not allow myself to get into a whirlwind of confusion." Hallelujah. Oh, I have heard a voice calling me out of Babylon. Oh, to a higher place. There's a mountain I can live upon. Oh, I have made my choice. Jesus is my joy and liberty. And my blood will never never have its hold on me. Oh, sing it now. I have heard a voice. Have you heard it? Come out of her, my people. Hallelujah. Oh, there's a higher place, a mountain that I can live upon. Oh, and I have made my choice. And Jesus is my joy and liberty. Oh, Babylon will never never have its hope. Hallelujah. Aren't you glad for that? Sing it again. Cuz I have heard a voice. It's called me out of Babylon. Hallelujah. To a higher place. There's a mountain I can live upon. Oh, I have made my choice. I am the Rebecca of this age. I will go. Hallelujah. I will go meet my Isaac. Oh, and Babylon will never never have a hold on me. Oh, I have heard a voice calling me out of Babylon. all to a higher place to a mountain that I can live upon. Glory, glory, glory. Oh, I have made my choice and Jesus is my joy and liberty. And Babylon will never ever have its hold on me. Sing the last lines. And Babylon will never never have its hold on me. Can you lift your hands unto the Lord? of people worshiping who come out of confusion. They know where they stand. We know who we're worshiping. Lord, we've identified with the voice. We've come out, Father. We're following in routine with the scriptures, with your plan for this age. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Never looking back to where we come from, but looking forward. Bless the name of the Lord. I have heard a voice. It's called me out of Babylon. Oh, to a higher place. For there's a mountain I can stand upon. Oh yeah. And I have made my choice. Though hard it was. Jesus is my joy and liberty. Oh, and Babylon will never never have a hold on me. Oh, Babylon will never never have its hold on me. Holy, holy, holy are you Lord. Hol, holy, holy, holy are you Lord. Oh, holy, holy, holy are you Lord. The angels and angels bow. The redeemed worship you now. Holy, holy, holy. Holy, holy, holy are you Lord. Holy, holy, holy are you Lord. The elders and angels bow. The redeemed worship you now. Holy, holy, holy are you Lord. Sing it unto him. Hol, holy. Just worship him. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Oh, holy, holy, holy are you Lord. The angels and elders bow. The redeemed worship you now. Holy, holy, holy are you Lord. One more time. Yes. Holy, holy, holy. It's a routine of worship. Yes. Holy, holy, holy are you Lord. The elders and angels bow. The redeemed they worship you now. Holy, holy, holy are you, Lord. The elders and angels bow. All the elders and angels bow. We the redeemed we worship you now. Holy, holy, holy are you Lord. Can we just bow our heads? Father, we just can't say enough how wonderful you are. How your word just comes and sets us free. We see ourselves in the book, Lord. You've given us that liberty, Lord, just to fall in routine, obedience of your scriptures, and following your plan. And oh, the world is so blind to see what you have done in this day. And we certainly don't want to take it for granted. It's just your grace to us. And thank you. Thank you, Lord, for bringing us to the message and opening our eyes of understanding. Thank you for helping us through our ups and downs. We know it's just grace that's going to lead us through. It's grace. It's all grace. And we thank you for it. And I pray that you just bless the this church. Bless your people, Lord, in all their struggles, things they're going through physically, mentally, spiritually, Father, that they're steadfast, routinely following the scriptures and your plan. Father, the rapture isn't going to be nothing for us. It's just going to be something that we just do and we're so thankful and we're looking forward to that. I pray that you would grant the heart desire of every heart here today in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. Amen. God bless you saints. You're dismissed. The fear of the Lord. Oh yes. Holy, holy, holy are you Lord.
