[35:10] privilege to be here and speak to you
[35:13] tonight but um if we could turn to our
[35:16] Bibles to uh Proverbs verse 31 or
[35:20] chapter 31
[35:39] amen proverbs
[35:44] 31 verse
[35:49] 10 I'm actually in the wrong
[35:56] one uh let see
[36:01] here
[36:08] Proverbs thought I was there
[36:11] sorry all
[36:14] right proverbs 31 and
[36:18] 10 it says who can find a virtuous woman
[36:23] for her price is far above rubies amen
[36:26] amen if we could also turn turn to John
[36:33] 15 you man her price is far above
[36:36] rubies John
[36:40] 15 verse
[36:45] 16 says you have not chosen me but I
[36:49] have chosen you and ordained you that
[36:52] you should go for uh bring forth fruit
[36:56] that your fruit should remain
[36:58] that's where that whatsoever you shall
[37:01] ask the father in my
[37:03] name he may give it to you amen you have
[37:06] not chosen me but I have chosen you and
[37:09] ordained you there's a terrible ring up
[37:11] here amen can we just bow our heads for
[37:14] a moment dear heavenly father Lord we
[37:17] love you and we thank you Father Lord
[37:19] for just such a beautiful day today Lord
[37:22] and Lord allowing us to come once again
[37:25] in your presence Lord to to serve you
[37:27] once more father and Lord we ask that
[37:30] you would just have your way tonight
[37:32] father I pray that you would just bless
[37:35] the the hearer and the receiver father
[37:37] Lord I pray that you would just help me
[37:39] to get myself out of the way and speak
[37:41] through me tonight Lord is our prayer
[37:44] Lord we love you we thank you in the
[37:46] name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray
[37:49] amen you can be
[37:51] seated um it's very simple tonight I'm
[37:56] I'm definitely not a a um a deep speaker
[38:02] so so you've all heard it before um but
[38:05] I pray that it can be a a blessing to
[38:07] you and um but I got to thinking of that
[38:10] scripture um who can find a virtuous
[38:13] woman for her price is far above rubies
[38:17] and um I'm not going to speak on
[38:19] marriage and divorce or anything like
[38:22] that tonight um but I would like to
[38:25] maybe speak tonight about how valuable
[38:27] you are how valuable what kind of value
[38:30] you have tonight and I know it you know
[38:33] might be a strange topic but I'd like to
[38:36] maybe title it
[38:38] Priceless and um but hopefully you know
[38:42] it would make sense tonight um but I am
[38:45] going to uh go slow so if you would just
[38:49] bear with me tonight um hopefully I
[38:53] won't keep you too long but um you know
[38:56] as I was thinking um virtuous woman her
[38:59] price is far above rubies and it's very
[39:03] important that when a man goes to choose
[39:05] a wife would he uh that he would choose
[39:08] a wife that the Lord had picked out for
[39:11] him and one with Godly character one he
[39:15] can love
[39:17] unconditionally and her with him and uh
[39:20] a woman can be the best thing that he's
[39:22] ever had outside of Salvation or she can
[39:25] be like water in his blood um and I got
[39:28] to thinking about that in a spiritual
[39:31] standpoint that God has a bride picked
[39:34] out for
[39:36] himself and he's not going to choose a
[39:38] bride that might be untrue to his word
[39:41] he's not choosing a bride that's going
[39:43] to think about doing her own thing and
[39:45] while he does his own thing but he's
[39:48] choosing a bride that has the same
[39:50] character car characteristics as himself
[39:55] a bride that's flesh of his flesh a
[39:57] bride that's bone of his bone amen a
[40:00] bride he is molding and shaping out with
[40:03] his word amen and and we may ask well
[40:07] who is his bride who is this bride going
[40:09] to be well I believe it's you and I
[40:11] tonight I believe his bride is going to
[40:13] be you and I and Ephesians 1 verse4 says
[40:17] according as he ha chosen Us in him
[40:21] before the foundation of the world that
[40:23] we should be holy and Without Blame
[40:26] before him and love
[40:28] amen now we are the attributes of what
[40:30] God had in his thoughts before the
[40:33] foundation of the world Amen do you
[40:35] believe that and uh you know I want to
[40:37] pause there for a minute and uh maybe uh
[40:40] take a take a painter or an artist here
[40:43] for a moment um I'd like to you know use
[40:47] an example of someone that um that could
[40:49] draw beautiful pictures if we take an
[40:51] artist or a painter someone that can
[40:54] just draw magnificent pictures and and
[40:57] now before they begin their work they
[40:59] first have to get an inspiration they
[41:02] first have to be inspired to draw
[41:05] something to to to make it art and um a
[41:08] genuine artist is inspired like a real
[41:11] poet or a singer or a musician whatever
[41:14] it might be it all has to come by an
[41:17] inspiration they first have to have an
[41:19] image in their mind before they can make
[41:22] it display on a canvas and um you know I
[41:25] I love art myself I um when we go to
[41:29] Pigeon Forge I I love going to those
[41:31] little art galleries there and and just
[41:34] going in and and honestly I can't go in
[41:36] without without tearing up a little bit
[41:38] the their art the the the beauty of them
[41:42] artists of what they can do just blows
[41:44] my mind every time and um and I love
[41:47] just seeing the art galleries and just
[41:49] the inspiration I love seeing the
[41:51] inspiration these people have and that
[41:55] that they had to think that in the their
[41:57] mind before they can make it display you
[41:59] know they can draw up the battles of of
[42:02] of that happened years ago or they can
[42:04] draw a mountain scenery or something and
[42:06] they can make it look so real uh and it
[42:09] just it amazes me and um and the detail
[42:13] that's there it just it just a painter
[42:16] can if he's a good painter he can turn
[42:19] it into a real Masterpiece and I just I
[42:22] just love going in there and and looking
[42:24] at that and I want to look at an artist
[42:27] we all know um for a few minutes uh uh
[42:31] we all know the Great Masterpiece of
[42:33] Michelangelo yeah with uh created of
[42:36] Moses now Michelangelo created tons of
[42:39] Art and um but I wanted to take
[42:42] Michelangelo brother Brandon used them
[42:44] so I'd like to use them tonight if
[42:46] that's okay um now before uh he could
[42:49] start carving he first had to have a
[42:51] mental picture of what he thought Moses
[42:54] ought to be and Michelangelo you know he
[42:57] was a great man it took him three years
[43:00] to finish this masterpiece he he would
[43:02] just take a rock of marble and he would
[43:05] just carve it day after day year after
[43:08] year just hacking away at that at that
[43:11] Granite there and and uh see only the
[43:13] man only the sculpture himself has it
[43:17] has in his mind of what he's trying to
[43:19] do and uh you know we may walk up to him
[43:22] and say well why why are you why are you
[43:24] breaking away this piece or or why are
[43:26] you working on that rock for and to The
[43:29] Outsider it doesn't uh who doesn't know
[43:32] what's in his heart it becomes nonsense
[43:34] to us we don't know the vision that he
[43:37] has and and we know we're just you know
[43:39] why is he just he's wasting his time
[43:41] breaking at something and and wasting
[43:43] his energy at just beating on something
[43:46] and uh but but we look at as nonsense
[43:49] whereas him he's got a mental picture in
[43:51] his mind of what that rock is going to
[43:52] be and um uh but to the sculpture
[43:56] himself he got a vision in his mind of
[43:58] what he's trying to make and trying to
[44:01] reproduce what he has on his mind in the
[44:03] form of a monument and that's the reason
[44:06] he can spend years digging out the Rocks
[44:08] he's he's got an image in his mind he's
[44:11] trying to make manifest
[44:13] amen now in doing so you have to start
[44:16] off right brother brandham says at the
[44:17] beginning you have to follow the pattern
[44:20] uh you can't get a little piece to start
[44:22] off here well we'll make it this way no
[44:25] he's got to have an exact p pattern and
[44:28] in his mind it's got that in his mind
[44:30] it's got to be that pattern amen he
[44:32] cannot vary from that pattern now in
[44:34] order to do this he has to draw it in
[44:37] his mind because we have no real
[44:39] pictures of Moses but we but uh he had
[44:42] to get a mental picture of what he
[44:45] thought Moses looked like and you know
[44:47] and then when he got it all perfect year
[44:51] after a year Michelangelo worked on this
[44:53] piece of art and he beat after it and
[44:55] and then he got it uh ah he got it so
[44:59] perfect every corner off and the eyes
[45:01] were just right and the hair was just
[45:03] right and the beard was just right and
[45:06] and he stood off and he looked at his
[45:09] Masterpiece and uh for the for for three
[45:12] years of hard labor and and how he had
[45:15] to hold that same vision all that time
[45:17] in his mind of what he was going to do
[45:21] and just think of that Vision on his
[45:22] mind for so many years he didn't lose
[45:25] that vision for three years years he had
[45:27] that Vision in his mind the whole time
[45:30] and not once did he ever lose that
[45:32] Vision to make it look just exactly what
[45:34] it was before him and he caught the
[45:37] first vision and how he had to work to
[45:39] that Vision cutting it off making it
[45:41] down and when he got to where he
[45:43] perfected it till it really got perfect
[45:46] that he stood and he looked at it and
[45:49] and finished up that morning with a
[45:51] hammer in his hand right and he was so
[45:54] inspired when he looked at it because
[45:57] the vision of his mind was standing
[46:00] before him in reality the the the the
[46:03] the the picture that that was in his
[46:05] mind was now looking right back at him
[46:08] and and it become a Great Masterpiece to
[46:11] Michelangelo what he had seen in his
[46:14] conception of what Moses was there it
[46:16] was figured before him what he had held
[46:19] in his heart all these years and the
[46:22] tools and the hours of sorrow and
[46:24] distress and the critics and everything
[46:26] else but he stayed right with the vision
[46:29] until it was completed and then when it
[46:32] was completed he stood back uh with a
[46:35] hammer uh in his hand and he looked at
[46:38] the
[46:39] monument and he was so inspired by uh by
[46:43] till he thought his own Masterpiece
[46:45] should speak back it was so perfect it
[46:49] was so beautiful it it was amazing that
[46:53] that he could uh stand there for 3 years
[46:56] with that image in his mind that when he
[46:59] finished it he looked at it and he
[47:01] thought that the image should speak so
[47:04] he smok the image with his hammer and
[47:06] yell speak cuz it was so perfect my come
[47:11] on now and it made a flaw it put a flaw
[47:15] in the image yes the image that he had
[47:17] spent years after
[47:20] years now how a flaw in the image
[47:25] right and I believe that that's what
[47:27] made it the
[47:28] Masterpiece but B says that he believes
[47:30] that's what made it the Masterpiece that
[47:33] he thought it was so perfect that he
[47:36] smoked the image and put a big gash in
[47:38] his
[47:39] knee thinking it should speak yeah
[47:44] amen hallelujah and and here if we were
[47:46] to look to God the great sculpture
[47:49] tonight amen who before the world was
[47:52] formed and before the foundations were
[47:54] laid he had in his mind what he wanted
[47:58] right and he wanted to make man in his
[48:01] own image he wanted to make something in
[48:04] reality of what H what was in a what was
[48:08] in a vision to him he wanted to make he
[48:11] wanted to turn uh uh what was in his
[48:14] mind into
[48:16] reality amen God Almighty who in the
[48:19] beginning before there was a day or a
[48:22] dawn uh before there was an Autumn or or
[48:26] a m
[48:27] God in his mind had man what man should
[48:30] look like what he should be and what he
[48:32] should act like amen are you thankful
[48:34] for that
[48:35] tonight and as he began to work upon the
[48:38] creeping things like upon the little
[48:40] animals upon the Earth and then he began
[48:43] to bring it from that into something
[48:45] else something higher then he finally
[48:48] brought in the larger animals such as
[48:50] the lion such as the tiger or the bear
[48:54] and he brought it into Li uh into the of
[48:57] maybe the monkeys and the Apes and and
[48:59] so forth uh now not Evolution because
[49:02] God we don't believe in evolution but he
[49:05] started with the lowest he started with
[49:07] the the the least and he begin to work
[49:11] up and he begin to to form his what was
[49:14] in his mind and as he worked because he
[49:16] had a pattern in his mind and he had to
[49:18] stay with that pattern
[49:21] amen and uh and as he worked and and uh
[49:26] but then uh finally there Came Upon the
[49:29] earth a Perfection and that was man man
[49:33] become the Perfection man become what
[49:37] God had in his mind amen and then he
[49:40] could see that man that uh that it
[49:43] looked like him so now when he looked
[49:46] upon him he was a reflection of what the
[49:49] Creator was amen and God hadn't now been
[49:54] able to achieve the thing that he wanted
[49:56] a man in his own image yes sir and his
[50:00] Masterpiece was almost perfect it was
[50:03] almost perfect God seen that his
[50:05] Masterpiece Adam was alone so what did
[50:08] he do he struck Adam in the side and he
[50:12] made with that he created a bride for
[50:15] Adam amen his Masterpiece was almost
[50:18] perfect it was looking right at God and
[50:20] then God smoted Adam in the side he
[50:23] smote him and then with that he brought
[50:25] forth a bride
[50:27] my and now to make the two one he put
[50:30] them brother Bram says he put them like
[50:32] any great sculpture in a place that's
[50:34] beautiful a sculpture wouldn't make a
[50:36] Great Masterpiece and then take it and
[50:39] set it aside in the alley somewhere or
[50:40] hide it behind the buildings but he
[50:43] placed it here upon the Earth and put it
[50:45] in the most beautiful place there was in
[50:47] the Garden of Eden he placed his
[50:49] Masterpiece the two being one in the
[50:51] Garden of Eden and how it must have
[50:54] pleased him that he saw the m
[50:56] Masterpiece was well after he rested
[51:01] uh he he he thought his Masterpiece was
[51:04] so perfect he thought it was so well it
[51:07] was so beautiful it was a perfect image
[51:10] that The Great Masterpiece had created
[51:13] that he himself rested and he placed his
[51:17] uh he was so pleased with his work the
[51:20] Lord and then we all know the story it's
[51:22] a sad story but then Satan had to come
[51:26] in and Mar God's creation God's
[51:30] Masterpiece Satan got jealous of God's
[51:33] Great Masterpiece so he come in and he
[51:36] marred uh God's Masterpiece with sin and
[51:41] God made a covenant with Adam and he
[51:43] placed him behind his word as a refuge
[51:46] to protect him but when they got out
[51:49] from behind his word it left the door
[51:52] open and Satan seeing the door open he
[51:54] come in uh and destroyed God's creation
[51:59] amen with sin the Masterpiece was broken
[52:03] and if I could say this tonight we we uh
[52:06] must stay with God's word no matter what
[52:09] no matter what the cost may be we have
[52:11] to stay with that word because if we
[52:13] don't stay with that word then we leave
[52:16] a door open for Satan to come in amen we
[52:20] must separate ourselves from the world
[52:22] we must stay with the word amen in the
[52:25] beginning was the word word and the Word
[52:27] was with God and the Word was God Amen
[52:31] and the word remains God and always will
[52:33] be God because God is in his word we
[52:36] must stay with the word amen now we find
[52:41] out that after he had found this great
[52:44] Maring God had found his this great
[52:46] marring and it had to be maybe it was me
[52:49] and you that maybe had found it and we
[52:51] had it maybe we had put all of our time
[52:54] we had put all of our effort into it and
[52:57] we would have just kicked the thing out
[52:59] we would have said just forget about it
[53:01] all that time I spent years after years
[53:04] God uh 6,000 years created this
[53:07] masterpiece and now it was broken before
[53:10] him if it was you and I who if it was me
[53:12] who created that and I had spent years
[53:15] after years after year creating a
[53:19] masterpiece and then someone come in and
[53:21] destroyed it I I would have just walked
[53:23] away I would have just threw all the
[53:26] pieces away and then then I would have
[53:27] just forgot about it but this great
[53:30] sculpture when he seen that the fall of
[53:32] his family the Masterpiece he wasn't
[53:35] willing just to leave it lay there face
[53:37] down and run he went to work immediately
[53:40] to rebuild it up again he wasn't willing
[53:42] that any should perish and lay there
[53:45] like that all the time because uh he is
[53:47] God and he will not be defeated so he
[53:50] went to work immediately and began to
[53:52] build man unto his own image again amen
[53:56] and he came down and he started all over
[53:58] again he was going to redeem man back to
[54:01] God he was going to redeem you and I
[54:04] back to God he wasn't going to leave us
[54:06] in the mud he wasn't going to leave his
[54:09] leave us so what did he do he he began
[54:11] to pick up the broken pieces and he was
[54:13] going to work again at his image he was
[54:16] going to work again at this masterpiece
[54:19] amen that way our child of God could
[54:21] stand perfect that way we could stand
[54:23] free we could stand virtess that we
[54:26] could stand free from sin my the Bible
[54:29] says that the Lord is not willing that
[54:31] any should perish so he needed someone
[54:34] who was worthy to redeem man back to God
[54:37] we needed someone worthy to redeem us
[54:40] back amen and he needed to create
[54:43] another Masterpiece his first one fell
[54:46] through sin so he began creating another
[54:48] one that couldn't fail amen he started
[54:52] creating another Masterpiece that
[54:54] wouldn't fail
[54:57] my amen but first in order to begin this
[55:01] Great Masterpiece again he first had to
[55:04] create another Covenant with man amen he
[55:08] put Adam on a covenant before do this
[55:11] and not this do this and and not that
[55:13] touch not handle not taste not but we
[55:16] find out when he started again he
[55:18] started with Abraham and in Abraham he
[55:21] started with him an unconditional
[55:23] covenant not if you will but I have I've
[55:26] already done it it's finished I've
[55:28] blessed you you and your seed and so
[55:30] forth after you it was an unconditional
[55:33] Covenant now amen it was God standing in
[55:36] the Gap this time amen he knew that it
[55:39] wasn't man he couldn't depend man on man
[55:41] no more he tried he gave it to man and
[55:44] he rested it and then man fell and and
[55:48] and broke that Covenant so what did he
[55:50] had to do he couldn't trust man he
[55:52] couldn't trust any of his creation
[55:54] because they were lower than the man so
[55:56] then he had to create another one that
[55:58] was that was uh better than man and the
[56:01] only one that was better and better and
[56:03] bigger and better was God himself he had
[56:06] to create the Covenant with himself oh
[56:09] my what a
[56:11] masterpiece oh he started with Abraham
[56:14] and now we have Abraham um or he started
[56:19] with Abraham his workmanship again and
[56:21] now with his unconditional Covenant then
[56:24] we find out he based on Abraham and gave
[56:26] him the Covenant unconditional with the
[56:29] promise now we have Abraham we have
[56:31] Isaac we have Jacob we have Joseph uh
[56:34] the four Patriarchs here displayed uh
[56:38] here he displayed the foundation of his
[56:40] work right he displayed the foundation
[56:44] through these four Patriarchs of his
[56:46] work and Abraham represented Faith he
[56:49] had great faith because he staggered not
[56:51] at the promises of God through unbelief
[56:53] then when he'd say the chips is down and
[56:55] everything he against him he still held
[56:57] on to God Amen then we have Isaac which
[57:02] which was beloved Son which represented
[57:04] love so we have faith we have love
[57:07] because Abraham being a type of God as
[57:09] Isaac was
[57:11] offered we find out that he carried the
[57:13] wood upon the hill and everything
[57:15] portrayed Christ foreshadowed him and
[57:18] then the ram came and was now uh offered
[57:21] in his stead now that was love H so we
[57:24] have uh Faith love and and we realized
[57:27] that Jacob's life really represented
[57:29] Grace so we have faith because it was
[57:31] gra it was the grace of God all the time
[57:34] with Jacob and so we have faith love um
[57:39] Grace and then come Joseph now there was
[57:42] nothing against Joseph he was the
[57:44] perfected one and God's Prophet that
[57:47] came forth among his Brethren and hated
[57:50] without a cause and was sold and in
[57:53] every way his life foreshadowed the life
[57:55] of Jesus Christ and came to his own and
[57:59] his own received him not amen we all
[58:01] know the story of Joseph and as Joseph
[58:03] was hated by his Brethren thrown into a
[58:05] ditch supposedly be dead took out
[58:08] exalted the right hand of pharaoh and
[58:10] when he left the throne they bow the
[58:12] they blowed the trumpet and now every
[58:15] knee had to Bow and to Joseph amen
[58:18] that's right and we find out that Jesus
[58:20] was almost sold for the same price
[58:22] Joseph was took him up from the pit and
[58:25] ascended into heaven sets aside the
[58:27] right hand of God and when he come from
[58:29] that place the trumpet will sound and
[58:31] every knee will bow and every tongue
[58:33] will confess to him Perfection amen so
[58:37] we that was faith we have faith we have
[58:40] love we have Grace and now we have
[58:43] Perfection amen then with the body work
[58:47] came on of this grape sculpture he made
[58:50] the bodyw work by the prophets amen he
[58:52] used these prophets to build this
[58:55] masterpiece then finally came the head
[58:57] of this great body which was Christ
[59:00] himself so he created a body but now we
[59:02] needed a head so then Christ himself
[59:05] come and and all the prophets had
[59:07] foretold of him all the foundation work
[59:11] had foretold of him all the way from the
[59:13] Garden of Eden from every time that he
[59:15] started I'll put enity between your seed
[59:18] and the serpent seed so ever since from
[59:19] the beginning uh was a was a type of
[59:23] Christ the natural types the spiritual
[59:25] and everything that happened with
[59:26] Abraham with with uh uh Jacob and Isaac
[59:30] and Joseph all them was a portrait of
[59:32] what Christ what it was supposed to be
[59:34] like in this day amen and once again he
[59:38] seen his own reflection with one man was
[59:42] born on the Earth from the womb of a
[59:43] woman that was God's Masterpiece it was
[59:46] the son of God Jesus Christ the reason
[59:49] he was because he was perfectly the word
[59:52] amen in the beginning was the word and
[59:54] the Word was with God and the Word was
[59:55] God and the Word was made flesh and
[59:58] dwelt Among Us amen now we see he
[1:00:02] reflected him in a perfect
[1:00:04] Masterpiece he was so perfect like God
[1:00:07] until he said in John
[1:00:08] 10:37 if I do not the works of my father
[1:00:11] believe me not but if I do though you
[1:00:13] believe not me believe the works that
[1:00:15] you that you may know and believe that
[1:00:17] the father is in me and I in him and if
[1:00:21] I do not the works of my father don't
[1:00:23] believe me amen amen so it's so it was
[1:00:26] so perfect he he reflected God so much
[1:00:29] well he was God in flesh amen and and
[1:00:32] Christ was a perfect reflection of what
[1:00:34] God had in his mind amen and ever since
[1:00:38] the fall of Man God was building up
[1:00:40] another Masterpiece that would reflect
[1:00:42] him and redeem him of which was fallen
[1:00:44] in the beginning amen and year after
[1:00:47] year and generation after generation the
[1:00:50] prophets foretelling his appearance and
[1:00:52] then one day one day after everyone
[1:00:56] waiting after everyone waiting the all
[1:00:58] the prophets for telling of of the
[1:01:00] messiah's coming and and then everybody
[1:01:03] waiting an anticipation of of when would
[1:01:06] it could be who is it and and then one
[1:01:09] day John the Baptist looked over and
[1:01:10] says Behold the Lamb of God which taketh
[1:01:13] away the sin of the world Amen this
[1:01:16] great sculpture of God made flesh
[1:01:18] through Jesus Christ who become the
[1:01:20] Priceless Son of God here to redeem man
[1:01:24] back to God amen just like Michelangelo
[1:01:27] when he created his Masterpiece it
[1:01:30] becomes so perfect that he smoke the
[1:01:32] image and brother Brenham says that
[1:01:34] God's Masterpiece was so perfect that he
[1:01:37] smoted him on Calvary amen he smoted him
[1:01:40] on Calvary for you and I my why so that
[1:01:44] through his blood he will redeem all

[1:10:37] sky amen you know when I was a teenager
[1:10:41] it was rough in a sense that as
[1:10:44] teenagers you feel like you don't belong
[1:10:47] anywhere you're not a kid no more in a
[1:10:50] sense but yet you're not an adult and
[1:10:53] sometimes it's it's kind of hard to find
[1:10:55] where you
[1:10:56] belong and and you know and Satan uses
[1:11:00] that opportunity to work on young people
[1:11:03] he he gets the people where they you
[1:11:05] know they're they're stuck of well we
[1:11:07] just got out of childhood but we're not
[1:11:09] adults yet and and no one the young
[1:11:11] people are the the little people don't
[1:11:12] want to accept them and the older adults
[1:11:14] don't want to accept them yet so they're
[1:11:15] caught in the middle and then Satan will
[1:11:18] come in and use that opportunity to play
[1:11:19] with her mind amen I was
[1:11:23] there and you know and and and and he
[1:11:28] did he did that on me at least he he
[1:11:30] played with my mind and sometimes I
[1:11:32] would feel worthless sometimes I I felt
[1:11:35] like no one cared and and sometimes I I
[1:11:38] felt like God just wouldn't hear my
[1:11:40] prayers and that they were just getting
[1:11:42] hit in the ceiling and falling back down
[1:11:44] and and you know I'm so thankful that I
[1:11:47] have Godly Parents and that would pray
[1:11:49] for me and and and dad would always tell
[1:11:52] me he would say Daniel God's got
[1:11:54] something for you you he would tell me
[1:11:56] that son you're you're special and Son
[1:11:59] God's going to use you one of these days
[1:12:01] and constantly reminding me constantly
[1:12:03] saying that that God's going to use you
[1:12:06] you you you mean something to God don't
[1:12:08] give up yet keep pressing on and I
[1:12:10] remember as a young person sister Jane

[1:12:14] tell me Daniel I don't know what it is
[1:12:16] but you're special God's got something
[1:12:18] for you and it encouraged me as a young
[1:12:20] person and gave me strength that God
[1:12:23] still cared for me oh my and as a
[1:12:27] teenager I that would always encourage
[1:12:30] me to keep pressing on that I knew that
[1:12:33] one day I was going to make it I knew
[1:12:35] that one day everything had to give way
[1:12:37] and I was going to make it amen I
[1:12:40] believe it was David that said in Psalms
[1:12:43] 37 I have been young and now I'm old yet
[1:12:47] I have not seen the righteous forsaken
[1:12:50] nor his seed of begging for bread and I
[1:12:52] want to tell you here tonight whether
[1:12:54] you're young or you're old then I know
[1:12:56] sometimes we just want to give up and
[1:12:59] sometimes we want to just throw in the
[1:13:00] towel and sometimes we don't feel loved
[1:13:03] and sometimes we feel like we aren't
[1:13:05] worth anything and sometimes we may feel
[1:13:08] like a failure but let me say this you
[1:13:11] don't you don't lose your column when
[1:13:14] you make a mistake you don't lose your

[1:13:22] what God called you to be because you
[1:13:23] make a mistake oh my God can use you
[1:13:27] again though you've messed up oh my God
[1:13:30] can bless you again though you failed
[1:13:32] don't let the devil tell you that God is
[1:13:34] finished with you cuz he's not finished
[1:13:36] with you amen don't let the devil tell
[1:13:40] you
[1:13:42] ah that that you're not worth anything
[1:13:45] amen you have a destiny you have a a
[1:13:48] work to
[1:13:49] accomplish right before the devil ever
[1:13:52] showed up before there was ever a devil
[1:13:54] God had you and his mind before the
[1:13:57] devil ever showed up God seen that blood
[1:13:59] over you amen your destiny is not up to
[1:14:03] any
[1:14:04] devil you haven't chosen me but I have
[1:14:07] chosen you amen and that's the same
[1:14:10] thing and if he's the one that's doing
[1:14:12] the choosing and he's chosen you then
[1:14:14] nothing can stop you nothing can
[1:14:17] separate you nothing can harm you no
[1:14:21] weapon formed against you will
[1:14:23] prosper amen you were sealed until the
[1:14:26] day of your
[1:14:27] Redemption my aren't you thankful for
[1:14:30] that tonight could I get a little bit
[1:14:33] more monitors I know they're ringing a
[1:14:34] little bit but my voice is about to
[1:14:38] go amen now I love my wife and and I
[1:14:41] love my baby girl and uh I feel like I I
[1:14:45] say something about them every time I
[1:14:46] get it behind the pull pit but I live
[1:14:48] with them all the time so uh and I and I
[1:14:52] got to thinking I I just I love them I
[1:14:55] love them so much and and I got to
[1:14:57] thinking the other day of how valuable
[1:15:00] my family is to me and and I can't tell
[1:15:03] you right
[1:15:05] now I I wouldn't I can tell you right
[1:15:08] now that I wouldn't give them up for
[1:15:11] anything in the world I wouldn't they're
[1:15:15] Priceless to me they they have a value
[1:15:17] to me they're part of me that's that's
[1:15:20] who I am and and I wouldn't get I
[1:15:23] wouldn't take I would trade them for all
[1:15:25] the money in the world ah they're
[1:15:28] Priceless to me a nice truck couldn't
[1:15:30] buy them from me a nice house couldn't
[1:15:33] buy them from me oh my free gas for the
[1:15:37] rest of my life couldn't buy them from
[1:15:40] me it just couldn't why because I love
[1:15:43] them and there's value in my family that
[1:15:46] maybe no one else will see but me maybe
[1:15:48] you could trade them for free gas for a
[1:15:50] year but I couldn't because they're part
[1:15:53] of me amen
[1:15:56] and I got to thinking that if I a man
[1:15:59] would care that much for my family that
[1:16:02] I a man a failure one who who makes uh
[1:16:06] mistakes one who can make my family
[1:16:09] upset with me or or maybe I couldn't be
[1:16:12] the leader that I want to be sometimes
[1:16:14] and a man that would just uh make
[1:16:19] disappointments and and things like that
[1:16:21] if I a man would care that much for a
[1:16:24] family what about God and his
[1:16:27] family turn the floors down amen she's
[1:16:31] going to ring uh but what about God God
[1:16:35] himself caring that much uh just turn
[1:16:38] the floors down please yeah thank you uh
[1:16:42] and but I got to thinking about his
[1:16:44] bride how much does he care for his
[1:16:46] bride amen the ma Matthew in the 4th
[1:16:50] chapter tells us that Jesus went into
[1:16:52] the Wilderness to be tempted of the
[1:16:54] devil
[1:16:56] and you know I just got to thinking one
[1:16:58] day I just got to thinking about this
[1:16:59] that if I was offered everything if if I
[1:17:03] was taken if someone had take me to a
[1:17:06] place and they own the world if they
[1:17:08] owned they own businesses after
[1:17:11] businesses if they were popular if they
[1:17:13] had money if they had all the fashion
[1:17:15] and everyone looked to them they were on
[1:17:16] TV three times a day and they come to me
[1:17:19] and they offered me and said for your
[1:17:21] family you can have all of this you
[1:17:23] could be worry free you could be
[1:17:25] stressfree you wouldn't have to worry
[1:17:27] about a thing everything would be handed
[1:17:29] to you on a silver platter everything
[1:17:32] you could wake up with breakfast and bed
[1:17:34] if you wanted to you know I wouldn't do
[1:17:37] it I couldn't do it I couldn't do it
[1:17:39] because I love them and as much as I
[1:17:43] want my wife to be happy and as much as
[1:17:45] I want my family to be happy I
[1:17:49] could amen and here they have taken
[1:17:52] Jesus uh Satan has uh take it uh Jesus
[1:17:56] went into the Wilderness to be Temple uh
[1:17:58] tempted and and by the devil and Satan
[1:18:00] would begin to tempt Jesus and he said
[1:18:03] command these stones to be made into
[1:18:05] bread and and though the if thou be the
[1:18:09] Son of God cast thyself down and but
[1:18:12] Jesus would always come back with the
[1:18:14] word but it is written he would always
[1:18:16] remind Satan of his word but it is
[1:18:18] written man man shall not live by bread
[1:18:21] alone amen and then and then Satan takes
[1:18:24] the up on a mountain and he shows him
[1:18:26] the kingdoms and the pleasures of the
[1:18:29] world and and said all of this can be
[1:18:31] yours if you would just bow down to me
[1:18:34] showed them all the kingdoms all the all
[1:18:37] the filth he showed them all the
[1:18:39] darkness of the world and said all of
[1:18:42] this can be yours if you would just bow
[1:18:44] down to me and maybe Jesus been weak and
[1:18:48] hunger as Satan would begin to plague
[1:18:50] his mind and as Satan was showing him
[1:18:54] the sin the filth the pleasures of the
[1:18:57] world that as he looked into the
[1:18:59] darkness of the world maybe you and
[1:19:02] maybe you and I flash before his mind
[1:19:06] and he knew that if he would accept the
[1:19:09] world all of humanity would be lost that
[1:19:12] you and I would be lost that his
[1:19:14] Masterpiece would be lost
[1:19:17] forever amen but he couldn't accept that
[1:19:21] amen the
[1:19:23] P he would allow himself to be suffered
[1:19:26] why would he allow himself to be beaten
[1:19:29] for you and I why would he allow himself
[1:19:32] to let his flesh be ripped up from from
[1:19:35] his bones and why would he allow himself
[1:19:38] to be rejected and despised why would he
[1:19:41] do that why because of love because he
[1:19:45] loved you because he seen you before the
[1:19:48] foundation of the world he wanted you to
[1:19:50] be with him he wanted you to reign with
[1:19:53] him right oh my he saw value in you amen
[1:19:57] he saw worth in you amen he saw a bride
[1:20:03] uh that would be that would want to be
[1:20:05] redeemed amen he thought you were saving
[1:20:08] so what did he do he came and he changed
[1:20:10] your life as the song
[1:20:12] says he thought you worth keeping so he

[1:22:47] that happened years ago and I I was
[1:22:51] thinking of this earlier and there's a
[1:22:53] song of it and I just have the song on
[1:22:55] repeat and just constantly playing but
[1:22:58] an auction that I believe the story was
[1:23:01] in a poem but you know maybe there was a
[1:23:05] hundred hundreds of people hundreds of
[1:23:08] people have come to this auction and
[1:23:10] from all over this auction because there
[1:23:12] was some great valuable items that was
[1:23:14] going to be auctioned off
[1:23:16] there and as each item was being
[1:23:20] sold for thousands of dollars beautiful
[1:23:23] items priceless items or or just just
[1:23:26] just things that people have created
[1:23:28] artifacts and everything people have
[1:23:30] found or whatever but people had heard
[1:23:33] of what was going to be there so they
[1:23:34] all came from all over the place and
[1:23:37] they wanted to to to spend their money
[1:23:39] on something that was
[1:23:41] valuable amen and as each item was being
[1:23:44] sold for thousands of
[1:23:46] dollars here comes the auctioner with an
[1:23:49] Old
[1:23:51] Violin am man it was Dusty It Was Out Of
[1:23:54] Tune
[1:23:55] a little bed and to the human eye this
[1:23:57] Old Violin had no value to
[1:24:00] it and maybe the crowd was a little
[1:24:03] disgruntled about it and here they had
[1:24:06] traveled for Miles all around to spend
[1:24:08] their money on something that had value
[1:24:10] in it and as the auction began and the
[1:24:15] auctioneer would
[1:24:16] say who would give me $1 for it who
[1:24:19] would give me
[1:24:20] two and it maybe it took a little bit
[1:24:23] for someone to well let's just get this
[1:24:26] out of the way sure I'll take $1 for it
[1:24:28] well I guess I'll take $2 for it and I
[1:24:32] was and as it was being auctioned off
[1:24:35] cheap a little old great haired man
[1:24:38] stood up in the back and and he walked
[1:24:40] up to the front and and he walked up to
[1:24:43] that Old Violin and he picked it up and
[1:24:45] well he wiped the dust off the strings
[1:24:49] and and he walked
[1:24:51] uh and he tightened up the bow he would
[1:24:54] begin to play there
[1:24:56] is a fountain
[1:25:00] filled with blood drawn from Emmanuel's
[1:25:05] veins and as he begin to play the crowd
[1:25:09] began to get moved and and they were all
[1:25:12] wiping their tears
[1:25:16] and and and and he set the bow when he
[1:25:19] finished he laid the Old Violin back
[1:25:21] down and walked back to his seed and the
[1:25:24] AU picked up the Old Violin and said who
[1:25:26] would give me $11,000 for it who would
[1:25:30] give me five who would give me 10 who's
[1:25:32] going to give me
[1:25:33] $100,000 it become Priceless it become
[1:25:37] valuable the crowd didn't understand why
[1:25:40] because it was the touch of the Master's
[1:25:44] Hand the touch of the Master's Hand made
[1:25:47] it from nobody to a nothing to to
[1:25:50] something that become the most valuable
[1:25:52] thing in there my
[1:25:55] what changed the value of the Old Violin
[1:25:58] the touch of the Master's Hand and
[1:26:01] something that had less value anything
