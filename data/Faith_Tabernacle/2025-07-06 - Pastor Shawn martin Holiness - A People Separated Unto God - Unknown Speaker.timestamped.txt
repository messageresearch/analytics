[28:50] all we thank you for the word of God how
[28:52] you open up our heart to the message of
[28:54] the hour Lord I was even thinking about
[28:57] the book of redemption the little book
[28:59] as it were that it wasn't really your
[29:01] desire Lord to hold that book because
[29:04] you gave it to Adam in the beginning
[29:05] before he fell
[29:07] And then of course when he fell he
[29:09] forfeited the rights to the title deed
[29:11] had to went back couldn't go to Satan's
[29:12] filthy hands went back to you original
[29:15] owner and it was held for 6,000 years
[29:17] but Lord in this last end time when the
[29:20] time was fulfilled that Lord that that
[29:23] worthy lamb rose and took that little
[29:25] book and open the seals thereof and sent
[29:28] it down to the seventh angel messenger.
[29:29] We know that we are those names in that
[29:32] little book. And Lord, now that little
[29:34] book, which we are, those names, we hold

[29:40] redeemed in that book. And how we thank
[29:43] you, Lord, in this last day when the
[29:45] world is looking for answers. God put
[29:48] within mankind a desire, a thirst after
[29:51] him. And they try everything in the
[29:53] world to satisfy that thirst. But
[29:55] nothing will satisfy that thirst outside
[29:58] of Jesus Christ the word and he is the
[30:00] word. Thankful Lord you open up our

[40:43] him and I believe that he is faithful to
[40:47] his word. And he said where two or three
[40:50] are gathered in his name, he'd be here.
[40:52] And and so we're really under
[40:55] expectation because when God is here,
[40:58] the supernatural takes place and there's
[41:01] no need to uh be despondent. Amen. And
[41:06] we can just cast all our cares upon the
[41:08] Lord knowing that he will take care of
[41:11] it. Amen. Well, it's good to be here in
[41:13] the house of the Lord and

[41:53] and um
[41:56] um we're uh just thankful for the Lord
[41:58] and and also just as it was said,
[42:01] thankful that God spared brother John
[42:04] and um
[42:06] doctor said he had a light heart attack
[42:09] the other day and and Um, I know we were
[42:13] a little bit, you know, even with
[42:15] praying and trusting the Lord and all
[42:18] that good stuff and but they kept him
[42:20] downstairs, you know, in the where he
[42:23] was supposed to be going to get checked
[42:25] out for six, seven hours and they said
[42:29] it would only be two hours and uh
[42:33] wouldn't call, didn't call. So, uh, poor
[42:36] sister Kim, she was, uh, trying to hold
[42:38] it together and, um, so when they
[42:41] brought him back, she just, uh,
[42:44] unleashed a river of tears. Amen. But,
[42:46] uh, so she was glad to have her hubby
[42:49] back in the room and safe and sound. And
[42:51] we're glad to have brother John back
[42:53] with us. And, Amen. We we certainly
[42:55] don't take things for granted. Um, life
[42:59] is so fragile,
[43:01] but I tell you, it's just the grace of
[43:02] God. Amen. That we're all here today.
[43:05] Amen. And good to have brother Enoch
[43:08] with us. Praise the Lord. I didn't know
[43:10] if you went back to Africa or uh got
[43:13] lost somewhere, but anyway, good to have
[43:15] you back. And um we love the Lord. Uh
[43:20] Brother Andrew Schuler, uh Andy, I was
[43:23] corrected. Andy Schuler
[43:26] um will be with us next Sunday and the
[43:29] Lord willing. So uh looking forward to
[43:32] uh hearing him and uh what the Lord
[43:36] would have upon his heart. Uh communion

[44:01] that. Um and then prayer service
[44:04] tomorrow night at 7. Amen. So, those
[44:07] that can come tomorrow evening, we'd
[44:10] love to have you. If you have your
[44:12] Bibles, we're going to turn to the book
[44:13] of Jeremiah, the
[44:15] 31st chapter.
[44:20] Amen. And um had a wonderful time
[44:22] yesterday uh fellowship and um um I just
[44:28] felt like the Lord blessed us with a
[44:30] wonderful evening and beautiful um well
[44:34] nice weather. It wasn't too hot and uh
[44:37] so uh nice and just a good time of
[44:40] fellowship. Amen. Uh before we go into
[44:44] the word, may we just bow our heads and
[44:47] talk to our Lord. Amen. We certainly
[44:51] need him. Amen. Father,
[44:56] we your children humbly bow our heads,
[45:00] Lord. And
[45:02] asking for your help,
[45:05] Lord. We're just mere mortals. And we we
[45:10] can read the book.
[45:12] We can talk about it, but Lord, it would
[45:14] take you to reveal it and give us
[45:17] understanding.
[45:19] And Father, as we see the time that
[45:21] we're living in, we realize we need you
[45:24] more than ever. We need a greater
[45:27] revelation,
[45:29] not not a new message, Lord, just a more
[45:33] revelation of what the message is
[45:36] speaking to us. And I pray that you
[45:39] would give it today, Lord. And Lord, I
[45:42] pray that you would just anoint both
[45:44] speaker and hearer. Help me to get
[45:46] myself out of the way, Father. And may
[45:49] you be able to speak through me. I ask
[45:52] it in Jesus Christ's name. And the
[45:54] church says, "Amen." Amen. And amen. So,
[45:59] we'll start in
[46:01] uh Jeremiah 31
[46:05] and we'll read the first three verses.
[46:09] But it says, "At the same time, sayeth
[46:13] the Lord, will I be the God of all the
[46:16] families of Israel, and they shall be my
[46:19] people."
[46:21] Thus said the Lord, the people which
[46:24] were left of the sword found grace in
[46:27] the wilderness, even Israel, when I went
[46:31] to cause him to rest.
[46:34] The Lord hath appeared of old unto me,
[46:37] saying, "Yay, I have loved thee with an
[46:40] everlasting love. Therefore, with loving
[46:43] kindness
[46:45] have I drawn thee." Amen. Then if you'll
[46:51] turn to the book of Isaiah,
[46:54] um Isaiah uh chapter 43.
[47:03] Amen.
[47:06] And we'll start at the first verse.
[47:09] Isaiah 43 and 1.
[47:14] But now, thus saith the Lord that
[47:17] created thee, oh Jacob, and he that
[47:19] formed thee, O Israel, fear not, for I
[47:22] have redeemed thee. I have called thee
[47:25] by thy name. Thou art mine.
[47:29] When thou passest through the waters, I
[47:32] will be with thee, and through the
[47:34] rivers, they shall not um overflow thee.
[47:39] When thou walst through the fire, thou
[47:41] shalt not be burned, neither shall the
[47:43] flame kindle upon thee. For I am the
[47:47] Lord thy God, the Holy One of Israel,
[47:50] thy Savior. I gave Egypt for thy ransom,
[47:54] Ethiopia and Sa for thee. Since thou was
[47:58] precious in my sight, thou hast been
[48:01] honorable, and I love thee. Therefore
[48:04] will I give men for thee, and people for
[48:07] thy life. Fear not, for I am with thee.
[48:11] I will bring thy seed from the east, and
[48:13] gather thee from the west. I will say to
[48:16] the north, give up, and to the south,
[48:19] keep not back. Bring my sons from far,
[48:23] and my daughters from the ends of the
[48:25] earth. Even everyone that is called by
[48:28] my name. For I have created him for my
[48:31] glory. I have formed him. Yay, I have
[48:36] made him. Then the 21st verse,
[48:40] this people have I formed for myself.
[48:45] They shall show forth my praise. Amen.
[48:50] You can have your seats
[48:53] this evening or morning. And um my title
[48:57] would be um holiness,
[49:01] a people separated unto God. Amen. And
[49:06] um
[49:09] you know um
[49:12] holiness is a um
[49:15] it's a word that
[49:19] um maybe is not often mentioned and and
[49:23] maybe when it is mentioned it's been
[49:25] used in reference to moral standards
[49:31] and uh a code of ethics And
[49:35] I guess some have maybe have limited um
[49:40] holiness to
[49:43] uh uh certain dress code, you know. Um a
[49:47] woman that um wears long skirts and um
[49:54] long hair and no makeup and no earrings.
[49:59] these things. We would call her a
[50:01] holiness lady. She's she's a she's a
[50:04] holiness lady. And a man that has long
[50:09] sleeves and short hair and uh clean
[50:13] shaven and uh no rings and things like
[50:18] that. Uh we would call him a holiness
[50:20] man. He's their holiness. And so we
[50:24] would identify them uh with a certain
[50:27] group, a holiness group or or whatever.
[50:31] And morals and ethics and and dress code
[50:36] and and these things, you know, they're
[50:39] they
[50:41] are associated with holiness. And when I
[50:44] say dress code, biblical dress code uh
[50:47] is is associated with with holiness.
[50:51] But holiness means more than than those
[50:55] things.
[50:57] Um,
[50:58] and that's what I want to talk about uh
[51:01] this morning. And and and
[51:04] I won't get to my whole thought this
[51:07] morning, but we'll just start out. But
[51:11] uh uh the word the word holy and I want
[51:15] you young people to uh listen to what I
[51:21] say because this will be applicable to
[51:24] you as well because I I believe that
[51:29] the Christianity the message
[51:32] salvation it's it don't only pertain to
[51:36] parents adults preachers
[51:39] it it it it pertains to you young people
[51:42] and I pray that God will help you to
[51:45] understand
[51:46] and it really burns something within you
[51:50] to want to get closer to the Lord. Um
[51:55] but the word holy first of all it means
[51:59] having a divine quality
[52:02] and so then then we would know that God
[52:06] is holy outside of God there is no
[52:10] divine quality there is no divine nature
[52:14] there there's there is no holiness so so
[52:19] brother Bram said God only has one
[52:21] nature and that's holy ess. And so this
[52:26] is why holiness is considered godliness.
[52:30] Holiness and godliness uh is the same
[52:33] thing. It's it's cleanliness. It's
[52:36] purity. Uh because it's God. God. Yeah.
[52:41] There there's nothing there's no
[52:42] impurity outside of God. Um um or or in
[52:47] God has no impurities. God is all pure.
[52:51] God is all holy. God is clean. He's
[52:55] just. He's that's that's God, right? And
[52:59] so, uh, the word holy or holiness, we
[53:03] know, would not exist without God.
[53:08] Uh, we we wouldn't even know the word.
[53:11] We wouldn't know the meaning of that
[53:13] word. We wouldn't know the experience of
[53:17] that without God. And so holiness cannot
[53:22] exist anywhere apart from God. Without
[53:26] God there is no holiness.
[53:29] And as you see that when God departs
[53:31] from something,
[53:33] watch what takes place.
[53:36] Uh because God is holiness. He's holy.
[53:40] Ain't that right? And so he is so holy
[53:44] that we find in in Isaiah the the first
[53:50] uh or the first part of the book uh that
[53:54] Isaiah uh he was in the temple and God
[53:58] showed himself. He said he saw him
[54:02] sitting upon the throne and and the the
[54:05] earth or the temple shook at the
[54:08] presence of God and and uh he saw the
[54:13] angels having to cover their their head,
[54:16] their eyes. They covering their feet and
[54:19] and um uh and and and they they were
[54:24] doing this in the presence of God. These
[54:26] were seraraphims that that never left
[54:29] the presence of God. They they they they
[54:32] were created for the presence of God.
[54:35] Not one time did they have they ever
[54:37] left the presence of God. They have no
[54:40] sin. They know no sin. They have no
[54:43] sinful nature. Nothing like that. And
[54:45] yet God is so holy that they have to
[54:48] keep themselves covered at all times.
[54:52] And so uh uh we find you know that um
[54:56] brother Brandham said these these uh
[54:58] serapims they just burned the sacrifice
[55:01] making a way for the worshipper the
[55:04] saint. See and yet they cover their
[55:07] faces in the his presence with reverence
[55:09] and humility. Ain't that right? God is
[55:13] so holy that he cannot stand sin. Right?
[55:17] He there is no sin in God. He cannot
[55:21] stand sin. And sin as as the prophet has
[55:24] taught us is unbelief.
[55:27] The he can't stand uh this this sin. And
[55:31] he cannot stand the works of sin. See,
[55:34] and so um when you think of it, unholy
[55:38] things, the unholy works of man is just
[55:42] an abomination to God.
[55:45] Uh it's and and this is why he destroyed
[55:49] the the the world in Noah's day. This is
[55:52] why he destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah in
[55:56] in the days of Lot. It was so filthy to
[55:59] God. It was so much sin and and
[56:02] corruption. It just become a putrid to
[56:05] God and and he couldn't stand it any
[56:08] longer to where he destroyed uh the
[56:10] people of that day. Amen. Now another
[56:15] definition for the word uh holy or
[56:19] holiness it means set apart for the
[56:23] service of God. Amen. Set apart for the
[56:26] service of God. So in other words there
[56:29] there's a holiness that that brings a
[56:32] separation.
[56:33] Amen. And it means devoted entirely to
[56:38] the deity or the work of the deity. So
[56:42] set apart for the service of God.
[56:45] Devoted entirely to deity. And and we'll
[56:49] say it this way, devoted entirely to God
[56:53] or for the work of God. Can you say
[56:55] amen? See, and so then then holiness
[56:59] having a divine quality and and set
[57:03] apart for the service of God, devoted
[57:06] entirely to God or the works of God.
[57:10] See? And so then then we we find this is
[57:13] where the separation when we talk about
[57:16] separation
[57:18] uh this word set apart means separated.
[57:21] Dedicated
[57:23] everybody say dedicated. Dedicated. Now
[57:26] when we think of dedicated I um you know
[57:29] being uh work having worked in uh some
[57:32] in the electrical field um you know
[57:36] there's some parts of the house that or
[57:38] appliances or whatever that that well
[57:42] you you you can you can run a circuit
[57:44] and have one circuit and you can have
[57:47] lights um uh not just in one room but
[57:51] you you can put lights in in the kitchen
[57:54] and and and and and then put lights in
[57:57] the living room and you can put them all
[58:00] on one circuit. You can put um uh three
[58:04] bedrooms of recepts um and you can you
[58:07] can put three or four bedrooms and tie
[58:09] them all together to one circuit where
[58:12] one breaker of uh uh turns on or turns
[58:16] off uh uh all the recepts in in three or
[58:19] four rooms at the same time. One
[58:21] circuit. But when it comes to like a
[58:24] refrigerator or uh uh a washer or
[58:28] whatever you you it's a we call it a
[58:31] dedicated circuit. There's nothing else
[58:34] that that will feed off that line uh
[58:36] that circuit except that one thing. It's
[58:40] it's dedicated for that purpose that
[58:44] that object right. And so when we think
[58:48] of dedicated, set apart, dedicated to
[58:52] keep for an intended purpose, then then
[58:56] when God established his church, and
[58:59] this is what he was telling the people,
[59:01] you are you are you are mine. You are
[59:05] mine. I have set you apart and I've
[59:08] dedicated you for one purpose and that's
[59:11] my purpose. A ain't that right? See, so
[59:15] then set apart. It's not to be mixed
[59:18] with, it's not to intermingle with other
[59:20] things. It's not to be used for other
[59:23] things than what God intended for it to
[59:28] be. So, so holy. So when we think of the
[59:31] word holiness, it it God would set apart
[59:36] a a people for for himself and they are
[59:41] dedicated. God would dedicate them for
[59:45] that particular purpose. They're not to
[59:48] be used for the devil. They're not to be
[59:50] used for worldly things. They're not to
[59:52] be used for any other thing than what
[59:55] God intended for them to be used for.
[59:59] Ain't that right? See, the Bible in the
[1:00:01] Old Testament talks about a man and a a
[1:00:04] woman uh who would have uh they they
[1:00:08] would make a vow which would be a
[1:00:11] Nazerite vow. And and and the prophet or
[1:00:14] the Bible says that what what they do
[1:00:18] when they make this Nazerite vow is they
[1:00:21] separate themselves
[1:00:23] unto the Lord. So that's what a Nazerite
[1:00:26] vow is. They are separated unto the
[1:00:29] Lord. They're they're and and so uh uh
[1:00:32] brother Brandham says that we all every
[1:00:34] Christian makes that Nazerite vow. Every
[1:00:37] every believer you make that Nazerite
[1:00:40] vow that we are separated. It's this is
[1:00:43] holiness. See uh uh because and again we
[1:00:47] we'll get into to to a lot of the other
[1:00:50] things about holiness but but but see
[1:00:53] I've seen holiness people when I say
[1:00:55] holiness people long skirts long hair
[1:00:58] and all that and yet they they're
[1:01:00] watching all kinds of things. They're
[1:01:02] talking filth. They're they're they're
[1:01:04] smoking. They're drinking. They you know
[1:01:07] and and but yet they call them they're
[1:01:09] called holiness because of their dress
[1:01:12] codes and and these things. Well, but
[1:01:14] but but there's got to be a a greater
[1:01:17] holiness, a greater meaning to holiness
[1:01:19] than than just dress code. You you've
[1:01:22] got to be separated un unto the Lord.
[1:01:25] And so because of their separation, when
[1:01:28] they make this Nazerite vow, because of
[1:01:31] their separation uh unto the Lord, God
[1:01:35] requires them to separate from things of
[1:01:38] the world. He required them to separate
[1:01:41] from wine and and and and o other things
[1:01:44] because this vow uh God God showing that
[1:01:48] you just don't make a vow and and and
[1:01:51] just continue on. There has to be things
[1:01:53] that you separate from. Uh can you say
[1:01:57] amen? So then uh uh we find now um in
[1:02:02] this God speaking of this Nazerite vow
[1:02:04] number six and three
[1:02:07] um it says God says he shall separate
[1:02:10] himself from wine and strong drink and
[1:02:13] shall drink no vinegar of wine or
[1:02:15] vinegar of strong drink neither shall he
[1:02:18] drink any liquor of grapes nor eat moist
[1:02:21] grapes or dried all the days of his
[1:02:25] separation he shall eat Nothing that is
[1:02:28] made of the vine tree from the kernels
[1:02:31] even to the husks. All the days of the
[1:02:34] vow of his separation. There shall no
[1:02:37] razor come upon his head until the days
[1:02:40] be fulfilled in which he separateth
[1:02:42] himself unto the Lord. He shall be holy.
[1:02:47] Can you say amen? See, his separation
[1:02:50] made him holy. See, he shall be holy and
[1:02:54] shall let the locks of the hair of his
[1:02:56] head grow all the days that he
[1:03:00] separateth himself unto the Lord. He
[1:03:02] shall come at no dead body. He shall not
[1:03:05] make himself unclean for his father or
[1:03:09] for his mother or his for his brother or
[1:03:12] for his sister when they die because the
[1:03:15] consecration of his God is upon his head
[1:03:20] all the days of his separation. He is
[1:03:24] holy unto the Lord. Can you say amen? In
[1:03:27] other words, he's dedicated unto the
[1:03:30] Lord. He cannot for nothing else. He
[1:03:32] can't do it for his mother's sake, his
[1:03:34] his mama or his daddy, brother, sister,
[1:03:37] whatever. He he in the days of his
[1:03:40] separation, he is holy unto the Lord.
[1:03:43] Ain't that right? So to be holy is to be
[1:03:48] separated un unto the Lord. Amen. And
[1:03:53] and and so it it's like Aaron uh uh his
[1:03:57] his um had garments. He was the high
[1:04:00] priest in the Old Testament and he had
[1:04:02] garments that God himself called holy.
[1:04:06] They were holy garments. See, and in
[1:04:10] Exodus 28:2,
[1:04:12] I didn't give them the scriptures, uh,
[1:04:14] but hopefully they can type that in.
[1:04:16] Exodus 28:2, it says, "And thou shalt
[1:04:19] make holy garments for Aaron thy
[1:04:22] brother, for glory and for beauty." See,
[1:04:25] and thou shalt speak unto all that are
[1:04:28] wise-hearted, whom I have filled with
[1:04:30] the spirit of wisdom, that they may make
[1:04:33] Aaron's garments to consecrate him, that
[1:04:36] he may minister unto me in the priest's
[1:04:41] office. See, so, so Aaron could not even
[1:04:44] uh officiate as a priest without these
[1:04:47] garments. So, these garments were not to
[1:04:49] be worn just any average day. Uh uh they
[1:04:53] were holy garments. They were dedicated
[1:04:57] for a specific thing. Amen. And Aaron
[1:05:01] could only put them on when he was
[1:05:04] officiating uh uh as a high priest. And
[1:05:07] and and and he could not officiate
[1:05:10] without these garments. See? And so the
[1:05:12] fourth uh verse breaking in, they shall
[1:05:15] make holy garments for Aaron thy
[1:05:18] brethren or thy brother and his sons
[1:05:20] that he may minister unto me in the
[1:05:24] priest's office. See, so then these
[1:05:27] garments were made different from all
[1:05:29] other garments to show that the
[1:05:31] separation. Ain't that right? Amen. So
[1:05:35] you you this this wasn't assembly line
[1:05:37] garment. Amen. This was a specialm made
[1:05:41] uh uh uh uh by divine order of God. God
[1:05:45] gave the instructions on how this
[1:05:48] garment was made. Amen. And and and it
[1:05:51] was it was a a particular garment to
[1:05:54] show the separation. So he couldn't just
[1:05:56] wear common everyday uh uh things of the
[1:06:00] world. He had to have something that was
[1:06:04] separated for this purpose. A ain't that
[1:06:07] right? So then we find the tabernacle
[1:06:09] that Moses made by the commandment of
[1:06:12] God had a holy place. Amen. It was a
[1:06:15] room that was separated from the outer
[1:06:17] courts and only the priests could enter
[1:06:20] in. Then there was the holiest of
[1:06:23] holies. A room that was separated uh uh
[1:06:28] um uh from not only the outer court but
[1:06:31] the holy place. It it was a separated
[1:06:34] room. A they they weren't combined
[1:06:37] together but but God would separate that
[1:06:41] room from all other rooms uh the outer
[1:06:44] court and the inner court and separate
[1:06:46] them. It was the holiest of holies. See
[1:06:50] and and and this room was separated for
[1:06:53] God alone. God would come into this
[1:06:56] room. He wouldn't go in the outer court.
[1:06:57] Wouldn't come into the the holy place.
[1:07:00] It would be in the in the holiest of
[1:07:03] holy that a a room dedicated for him to
[1:07:07] come and dwell. Ain't that right? And in
[1:07:10] this room was the mercy seat and God
[1:07:12] would come between the cherubams. See,
[1:07:14] and the high priest would come and make
[1:07:16] an atonement and there would be blood
[1:07:18] upon that mercy seat. Ain't that right?
[1:07:21] See, in this room, a separate room was
[1:07:24] the mercy seat. In in that room was the
[1:07:26] ark of the covenant, the word. Amen. And
[1:07:30] here is where the blood was. Now, now to
[1:07:33] think of this, we are a three-fold
[1:07:35] being. Amen. We're body, spirit, and
[1:07:38] soul. Ain't that right? And and and and
[1:07:40] we actually type out that the outer,
[1:07:43] inner, and the outer court, inner court,
[1:07:45] and the holiest of holy. Our flesh uh uh
[1:07:49] uh is is our is the outer court. Amen.
[1:07:52] And brother Bram talks about these
[1:07:54] things uh in in in the earlier part of
[1:07:57] his message uh uh ministry. But the
[1:08:00] outer court is your flesh. The inner
[1:08:03] court is your spirit. Amen. But the the
[1:08:07] your soul your soul is the most holy
[1:08:10] place. That that soul is where God
[1:08:13] dwells. That that soul is where the word
[1:08:17] must dwell. Thus the soul is where the
[1:08:20] mercy seat is. See, it's it uh Brother
[1:08:23] Brham said in one place, the mercy seats
[1:08:24] in your heart. Amen. The blood would be
[1:08:27] applied and and that's where God would
[1:08:30] dwell himself, but it has to be
[1:08:32] something dedicated for his dwelling
[1:08:35] place. Can you say amen? It there's a
[1:08:39] holiness there that God is is after.
[1:08:42] It's it's a people that are dedicated.
[1:08:45] And when he when he calls you for
[1:08:47] himself, it's not just a um h a dress
[1:08:51] cold or things like that, he wants your
[1:08:54] soul, amen, to where he could dwell in.
[1:08:57] See, your your your outer flesh is going
[1:08:59] to have your ups and downs. Your your
[1:09:01] spirit is is is going to be affected by
[1:09:04] things and as as as was with with the
[1:09:07] the outer court and the inner court in
[1:09:10] the in the New Old Testament. But that
[1:09:12] that soul is is where God would dwell in
[1:09:17] in in the in the uh between the
[1:09:19] cherubams. Can you say amen? Amen. It's
[1:09:22] in that holiest of holy is where God
[1:09:25] would make his vindication known. A
[1:09:29] ain't that right? See, and and so the
[1:09:32] soul then must be separated unto the
[1:09:35] Lord for God alone. See, anything that
[1:09:39] was used for God's service was
[1:09:43] considered holy. There was the vessels
[1:09:46] that they were holy vessels. There was
[1:09:48] the oil that God uh called holy oil.
[1:09:53] There was the holy altar. There was holy
[1:09:56] perfume. See, and and none of these
[1:09:58] things were to be used outside of what
[1:10:02] God intended for them to be used. Ain't
[1:10:05] that right, God? God is is uh he's
[1:10:09] particular if if he's going to make
[1:10:11] something and and and if you notice all
[1:10:14] all of these things uh uh God required
[1:10:17] them to make and he gave them the
[1:10:19] instructions on how to make them because
[1:10:21] he didn't want just old blowjo down the
[1:10:24] road making something and then and then
[1:10:26] be brought in. He designs it. God
[1:10:29] designed it. God had it made. Amen. And
[1:10:32] when God made it, Amen. It was to be
[1:10:34] used only for his purpose.
[1:10:38] Now, so so they were set apart. The lit
[1:10:42] levitical priesthood was set apart for
[1:10:45] the service of God. Therefore, they were
[1:10:48] called holy. The the the prophets, the
[1:10:51] Bible called the prophets, even holy men
[1:10:54] of God because they they they
[1:10:58] spoke God's word. God would uh uh uh
[1:11:01] raise them up. Amen. They were dedicated
[1:11:04] for his purpose and his purpose alone.
[1:11:08] And I'm talking about true prophets, not
[1:11:09] false prophets, not not Balum, you know,
[1:11:12] that that could be hierlings and and all
[1:11:14] of these things, but these were prophets
[1:11:17] that that were dedicated to speak the
[1:11:19] word of God to the people. And they were
[1:11:22] called holy,
[1:11:24] holy men of God.
[1:11:27] Now, notice what God said to Israel in
[1:11:30] Deuteronomy 7 and6. Thou art an holy
[1:11:33] people. That's right. Unto the Lord thy
[1:11:36] God. For the Lord thy God hath chosen
[1:11:38] thee to be a special people unto
[1:11:40] himself.
[1:11:42] How many believes you're special?
[1:11:44] You're a special people. Young people,
[1:11:47] you're special.
[1:11:50] I don't care what the world thinks about
[1:11:52] you. You're special. I I wish you could
[1:11:55] really I wish you young people could
[1:11:57] really understand how special you are to
[1:11:59] God.
[1:12:03] The Lord thy God hath chosen thee to be
[1:12:05] a special people unto himself above all
[1:12:08] people
[1:12:11] that are upon the face of the earth. The
[1:12:13] Lord did not set his love upon you, nor
[1:12:16] choose you because you were more in
[1:12:18] number than any people. For you were the
[1:12:20] fewest of all people, but because the
[1:12:23] Lord loved you. That's right. And
[1:12:25] because he would keep the oath which he
[1:12:27] had sworn unto your fathers, hath the
[1:12:29] Lord brought you out with a mighty hand,
[1:12:31] and redeemed you out of the ha house of
[1:12:34] bondman, and from the hand of Pharaoh,
[1:12:36] king of Egypt. Ain't that right? So then
[1:12:39] he had chosen them to be a special
[1:12:41] people above all people. Think of that.
[1:12:45] It wasn't that they were trying to be
[1:12:47] better. God made it. God chose them to
[1:12:50] be a special people. They were the
[1:12:53] people that God made the covenant to.
[1:12:56] They were the people that God redeemed.
[1:12:59] They were the people that God made an
[1:13:01] atonement for. They were the people that
[1:13:04] had the promise. They were the people
[1:13:07] that had an inheritance that God himself
[1:13:09] gave them. God made them special. Yes,
[1:13:14] sir. He separated them. Notice he
[1:13:17] separated them by redeeming them.
[1:13:21] Just like he separates all of us.
[1:13:24] Not not by our standard of clothes,
[1:13:28] but by redeeming us. There were people
[1:13:32] whose names was in that book. That's
[1:13:34] right. Right. Amen. And God redeemed
[1:13:39] those names and separated them.
[1:13:45] Amen. So separated were they that God
[1:13:48] told Israel not to make any covenant
[1:13:50] with the nations. Amen. That he cast out
[1:13:53] before them. Remember he said, "I'll
[1:13:55] drive the nations away from y'all. The
[1:13:58] Hittites, the Hivites, the Jebusites,
[1:14:01] and all the itites.
[1:14:04] And God told them, "Don't make a
[1:14:06] covenant with them. Don't do it. That's
[1:14:08] that's the enemy. That's my enemy. Your
[1:14:10] enemy is my enemy, right?
[1:14:14] And my enemy is your enemy. Don't make a
[1:14:16] covenant with them." But he told Israel
[1:14:18] to smite those nations and utterly
[1:14:20] destroy them and show no mercy to them.
[1:14:23] Are you with me? That still stands
[1:14:26] today. That was that was to a natural
[1:14:29] nation, a natural people. Today is
[1:14:31] spiritual.
[1:14:33] Ain't that right? He told Israel to
[1:14:36] smite those nations and utterly destroy
[1:14:38] them. Show no mercy. And they were not
[1:14:41] to make marriages with them.
[1:14:44] No intermingling in marriage with them.
[1:14:47] I don't care how beautiful that girl is.
[1:14:49] Don't touch her.
[1:14:52] Hello. I don't care how well handsome
[1:14:54] that that young man is. Don't you touch
[1:14:57] it. Don't you mix yourself with him.
[1:15:01] Ain't that right? Notice why would God
[1:15:04] say these things? Because he says this,
[1:15:07] "For they will turn away thy son from
[1:15:10] following me that they may serve other
[1:15:13] gods." Hello. I've called you to be
[1:15:16] dedicated for me. And the moment you
[1:15:19] start mixing with them guys and you
[1:15:22] start mixing with the enemy and and all
[1:15:24] these things, they have no covenant.
[1:15:26] They have no promise. They have no
[1:15:28] inheritance. I am not their God. Yes.
[1:15:32] And the moment you start mingling with
[1:15:34] them, Amen. they will turn your sons and
[1:15:37] daughters away from me to serve other
[1:15:39] gods.
[1:15:43] So will the anger of the Lord be kindled
[1:15:46] against you and destroy thee suddenly.
[1:15:48] That's what he says. See, so what would
[1:15:51] God command them to do? They were to
[1:15:54] they were to destroy
[1:15:56] their altars, the enemy, the heathens,
[1:16:01] altars that were designed and built for
[1:16:04] other gods. God told Israel, you destroy
[1:16:07] them, right? See, so God does I mean,
[1:16:11] we're we're God requires his people to
[1:16:14] do something. If you're separated unto
[1:16:16] me, you believe you're separated unto
[1:16:18] me, I'm going to ask you to do
[1:16:20] something. I'll drive them from be from
[1:16:23] before you. I'll I'll drive them out of
[1:16:25] the land. But what is remaining, you
[1:16:28] destroy. You take every altar that they
[1:16:31] have built up, destroy. Don't you try to
[1:16:34] offer unto me a sacrifice by that altar
[1:16:37] that they have made. I've got an altar
[1:16:39] that is holy. Can you say amen? I'll
[1:16:42] raise up an altar that is dedicated unto
[1:16:45] me. Them have been dedicated unto their
[1:16:47] idols. Destroy it. Amen. Break down
[1:16:51] their images, cut down their groves, and
[1:16:55] burn their images with fire.
[1:16:58] Why? Because they were a holy people,
[1:17:02] separated unto God. That's right. That's
[1:17:06] right. Don't tolerate with all that.
[1:17:11] Can you say amen? Amen.
[1:17:15] When you know we we you you read about
[1:17:18] it the handwriting on the wall. When did
[1:17:20] that happen?
[1:17:22] Why did it happen? The Bible tells us
[1:17:25] that the wicked king remember Israel
[1:17:28] uh by Nebuchadnezzar and it was by the
[1:17:31] hand of the Lord because of their sin
[1:17:33] disobedience that they went into
[1:17:35] captivity into Babylon.
[1:17:38] Then it was the next king. I think maybe
[1:17:41] the son of Nebuchadnezzar. I don't I I I
[1:17:44] don't know that right away. But it was
[1:17:47] King Belshazzar.
[1:17:49] Later on
[1:17:51] uh was having a feast. He was an ungodly
[1:17:53] king
[1:17:55] uh wicked and and so he uh wanted to
[1:18:00] have a feast. And so instead of using
[1:18:03] his his cups and his things that were
[1:18:07] dedicated for their gods, he he
[1:18:11] commanded that they bring Jehovah's
[1:18:15] things.
[1:18:16] See, because when Nebuchadnezzar uh took
[1:18:19] Israel captive, he took all the holy
[1:18:21] things back to their land.
[1:18:24] And so the things that were used to
[1:18:27] drink uh unto God and and to make
[1:18:30] sacrifice unto God and and all these
[1:18:32] things, he brought the holy things and
[1:18:35] stored them away. Now, here's this
[1:18:37] wicked king. And he commanded the
[1:18:40] vessels of the Lord to be brought up so
[1:18:42] that he and his princes and his wives
[1:18:45] and his concubines might drink from
[1:18:48] them. Hello. Now Daniel 5 and4 it says
[1:18:53] they drank wine and praised the gods of
[1:18:58] gold
[1:19:00] of silver of brass of iron of wood and
[1:19:05] of stone took things that were dedicated
[1:19:09] to God. took holy things that God had
[1:19:12] dedicated for himself and that wicked
[1:19:15] people began to use them things for
[1:19:18] their gods and God was displeased.
[1:19:23] In the same hour came forth fingers of a
[1:19:26] man's hand and wrote over against the
[1:19:29] candlestick upon the plaster of the wall
[1:19:31] of the king's palace. And the king saw
[1:19:34] the part of the hand that wrote.
[1:19:37] Now they he was troubled and and and uh
[1:19:41] it it was so it was so bad that every
[1:19:45] well the Bible says that actually the
[1:19:48] king wet himself.
[1:19:51] He when he saw this it it was a
[1:19:53] handwriting on the wall and he was
[1:19:55] troubled. So, so the the the
[1:20:00] uh they they brought in Daniel the
[1:20:02] prophet to interpret the handwriting.
[1:20:06] And this is what he said. God hath
[1:20:09] numbered thy days. He's interpreting the
[1:20:11] the the handwriting on the wall. God
[1:20:14] hath numbered thy kingdom and finished
[1:20:16] it. Yeah. Thou art weighed in the
[1:20:19] balances and are found wanting. Thy
[1:20:22] kingdom is divided and given to the Mes
[1:20:25] and the Persians. No long no sooner had
[1:20:29] he stopped there that the enemy had come
[1:20:31] in. Amen. And and and captured uh uh uh
[1:20:36] the king and and the the the kingdom.
[1:20:40] See, but it's it's see you people got to
[1:20:44] be careful because now notice what's
[1:20:46] happening. The prophet in this age told
[1:20:49] us there is a handwriting on the wall.
[1:20:52] And I believe that handwriting on the
[1:20:54] wall has come by the very same actions
[1:20:58] that this king did. They're using
[1:21:00] dedicated things, things that are
[1:21:02] dedicated to the Lord. Amen. This is why
[1:21:05] brother Brandon would talk and he was so
[1:21:07] against these guys that would sing
[1:21:08] country music out there and then come
[1:21:11] into the church and sing holy songs.
[1:21:14] Songs that are dedicated for Christians.
[1:21:16] dedicated, amen, for Christians to sing
[1:21:19] unto God. And you got these filthy unc
[1:21:22] unconverted men, women that will sing
[1:21:25] out there in the bars, play for the
[1:21:27] devil, and then come into the house of
[1:21:29] God singing holy songs. There's a
[1:21:32] handwriting on the wall.
[1:21:34] preachers that forsake the word of God,
[1:21:37] taking this word that is holy and
[1:21:39] consecrated and they're they're mixing
[1:21:42] it with their own ideas of their own
[1:21:44] opinions, their own ways, their
[1:21:46] traditions. The handwriting is on the
[1:21:49] wall. Amen. See, there's things you
[1:21:53] cannot mix God. You cannot mix things of
[1:21:56] God, holy things with the world. Right.
[1:22:00] See, so God didn't like the fact that
[1:22:02] something that was to be used for his
[1:22:04] own glory was used to praise on other
[1:22:07] other gods.
[1:22:09] Ain't that right? Now,
[1:22:13] one thing that our opening scriptures
[1:22:14] have in common is that God claims a
[1:22:19] people for himself. This is a people
[1:22:22] that he has chosen to work through. This
[1:22:24] is the people that he has called to show
[1:22:26] forth his glorious works. This is a
[1:22:30] people that he has called to manifest
[1:22:31] his presence and power. Ain't that
[1:22:34] right? So God, this is a people that has
[1:22:37] separated unto the Lord. See, now notice
[1:22:40] uh in Leviticus 20 and 24, God said to
[1:22:44] the children of Israel, I am the Lord
[1:22:46] your God.
[1:22:48] Well, aren't you glad for that? What a
[1:22:51] comfort that would be. other gods.
[1:22:53] Heathens had other gods. Gods of wood,
[1:22:56] gods of gold, gods of silver, gods of
[1:22:58] stone, gods of whatever. But God looks
[1:23:00] at that group of people and says, "But I
[1:23:03] am the Lord your God." Can you say,
[1:23:05] "Amen." Now, think of it. There's a lot
[1:23:07] of people out there worshiping idols and
[1:23:10] they have no protection. They have no
[1:23:13] they they they have no uh uh uh uh
[1:23:17] relationship with. But yet here's the
[1:23:20] living God, the only God that that says,
[1:23:23] "I am the Lord your God." Ain't that
[1:23:26] right? Which have separated you from
[1:23:30] other people. Oh my. God separated them
[1:23:34] that he could be their God.
[1:23:37] Ain't that right? Now the 25th verse uh
[1:23:41] Leviticus 20:25
[1:23:43] says, "And you shall ye shall therefore
[1:23:46] put difference between clean beasts and
[1:23:49] unclean between unclean fowls and clean.
[1:23:53] And you shall not make your souls
[1:23:55] abominable by beast, or by foul, or by
[1:23:58] any manner of living thing that creepeth
[1:24:00] upon the earth, which I have separated
[1:24:04] from you as unclean. Amen. And you shall
[1:24:10] be holy unto me, for I am the Lord. I
[1:24:14] the Lord am holy, and have severed you
[1:24:17] from other people that you should be
[1:24:21] mine. Amen. Can you say amen? Think of
[1:24:24] that now. God himself severed this
[1:24:27] people that they should be his. So he
[1:24:31] wanted their way of living to be
[1:24:34] different from all the others. He wanted
[1:24:37] their way of worship to be different
[1:24:39] from the others. He wanted their
[1:24:41] sacrifice to be different from the
[1:24:43] others. He wanted their teaching to be
[1:24:46] different from the others.
[1:24:49] Can you say amen? They were to know the
[1:24:53] difference between clean and unclean.
[1:24:56] They were to know. God separated them.
[1:25:00] He severed them from all the other
[1:25:02] people for himself. Now he commanded
[1:25:05] them, "You shall know, know the
[1:25:07] difference between what I call clean and
[1:25:10] what I call unclean."
[1:25:13] Ain't that right?
[1:25:15] See? And so if he separated something
[1:25:18] from them as unclean, he did not want
[1:25:22] them bringing it back into their
[1:25:24] sacrifices, into their worship, into
[1:25:28] their camp.
[1:25:30] Amen.
[1:25:33] Can you say amen? Yeah,
[1:25:36] it saddens me today that most a lot of
[1:25:40] people talk about the Lord, but they
[1:25:41] don't know the difference between what
[1:25:42] God has called clean and unclean
[1:25:45] and what God has taken out from the camp
[1:25:48] by a way of a prophet in this age. The
[1:25:52] churches are bringing it in. Yeah.
[1:25:57] So, God didn't, now notice, if if you'll
[1:26:00] understand this, God didn't just
[1:26:02] separate the parents of Israel
[1:26:06] and only consider them to be holy,
[1:26:10] but the children were to be separated.
[1:26:15] The children were to be holy.
[1:26:19] Can you say amen? Amen. And God put that
[1:26:22] responsibility on the parents. Amen.
[1:26:27] To keep their children and teach them
[1:26:31] the way of the Lord. Amen.
[1:26:35] Can you say amen? That's right. You see,
[1:26:39] this is where we're coming to now. This
[1:26:41] is where the the the world is today
[1:26:45] is we've got a generation that ain't
[1:26:47] been taught God.
[1:26:50] Because parents ain't doing their job.
[1:26:54] Brother Bram said, "It's not juvenile
[1:26:56] delinquency, it's parent delinquency."
[1:26:59] We want to talk about God. We want to
[1:27:01] talk about the things of God, but what
[1:27:03] about our children coming up?
[1:27:06] Can you say amen? We don't teach them to
[1:27:09] be faithful in the house of God.
[1:27:13] Work is too important. You're just like
[1:27:16] a layout of sin. you you're not coming
[1:27:19] in as a holy unto God, holiness unto the
[1:27:22] Lord. And you're teaching your children
[1:27:24] to do the same thing that whatever God
[1:27:26] says, don't you worry about it. Money is
[1:27:28] more than what God says. Work is more
[1:27:30] than what God says. Can you say amen?
[1:27:32] Have you not understood that God has
[1:27:34] promised to a people that he has
[1:27:36] separated that I will be the Lord your
[1:27:38] God. I will be your provider. I will be
[1:27:41] your protector. I will be the one when
[1:27:44] you have the need. Don't you look to
[1:27:45] your boss. Don't you look to other
[1:27:47] things. Look unto me, saith the Lord,
[1:27:50] and I will bring forth. I'm the God of
[1:27:53] miracles.
[1:27:56] See, God has separated a people that he
[1:27:58] could be a God of miracles to.
[1:28:02] Yes. Do we Are we lazy? Absolutely not.
[1:28:05] God tells us to work. But when you put
[1:28:07] work, Brother Bram says it's okay. Amen.
[1:28:10] He says it's okay to miss work now and
[1:28:12] again. He said, "But don't you miss
[1:28:14] Sunday school? Don't you miss church?
[1:28:18] Can you say amen? Why? You're holy unto
[1:28:21] the Lord. Holy unto the Lord. Leoa has
[1:28:24] put God aside.
[1:28:26] But there is a people living in Leosa
[1:28:29] that has been called and separated and
[1:28:32] severed from the other people that they
[1:28:34] would be holy unto God.
[1:28:39] Can you say amen? That's exactly right.
[1:28:42] Now listen church. It's impossible to be
[1:28:45] a Christian without there being
[1:28:48] holiness.
[1:28:49] If if there's no holiness, there is no
[1:28:51] Christianity.
[1:28:54] We We've mixed Christianity so much with
[1:28:56] the world that everybody's a Christian.
[1:28:59] Anybody that talks about God is a
[1:29:01] Christian. Oh, they must love the Lord.
[1:29:03] If bobbed w if they're still cutting
[1:29:05] their hair, it's not holiness unto the
[1:29:08] Lord. If they're wearing their makeup,
[1:29:10] it's not holiness unto the Lord. If
[1:29:12] they're wearing earrings, the Bible says
[1:29:15] or the prophet said that's devil
[1:29:16] stirrups.
[1:29:19] See, there's got to be a holiness unto
[1:29:22] the Lord. Amen. That's true. Can you say
[1:29:26] amen?
[1:29:27] Now, the Bible says that without
[1:29:29] holiness, no man shall see God. That's
[1:29:32] the word of God. Ain't that right? See,
[1:29:36] so therefore, God would have to separate
[1:29:38] us
[1:29:40] if we're going to see God. Amen.
[1:29:43] Ain't that right? See, now now if you
[1:29:46] look also there in Isaiah 35:6, it says,
[1:29:50] "And in highway there there there shall
[1:29:54] there be and a way, and it shall be
[1:29:58] called the way of holiness, the way of
[1:30:02] holiness." Right. So say that again. and
[1:30:05] and in highway shall there be and a way
[1:30:08] and it shall be called the way of
[1:30:11] holiness.
[1:30:12] Notice the unclean shall not pass over
[1:30:15] it.
[1:30:17] But it shall be for those the wayfairing
[1:30:20] men, though fools shall not heir
[1:30:24] therein. Amen. Can you say amen? Now the
[1:30:28] prophet says it's not called the highway
[1:30:30] of holiness. Yeah.
[1:30:33] Yet a highway goes back and forth.
[1:30:37] But a way of holiness, one way, one way,
[1:30:41] right? It's a way of holiness. And the
[1:30:45] way of holiness, notice, is in the
[1:30:48] middle of the road. It's what brother
[1:30:50] Bram said. It's in the middle of the
[1:30:52] road.
[1:30:55] Amen. See, he says on one side of the
[1:30:57] road, you have knowledge and wisdom.
[1:31:00] cold, starchy formalism.
[1:31:03] On the other side of the road, you have
[1:31:05] wildfire and and fanaticism.
[1:31:10] Ain't that right? But the middle of the
[1:31:12] road, we all know a middle of the road
[1:31:15] is built in such a way to as to wash
[1:31:19] trash,
[1:31:21] keep the road clean.
[1:31:24] All the trash ends up on this side or
[1:31:26] that side. Brother Brown says that the
[1:31:29] road is built the middle of the road to
[1:31:31] where there's no mud puddles. There
[1:31:33] ain't no water puddles in the middle of
[1:31:35] the road.
[1:31:38] In other words, God's going to make sure
[1:31:39] you don't hydroplane and wreck up
[1:31:42] somewherees.
[1:31:44] It's a way of holiness.
[1:31:48] That's right. Can you say amen?
[1:31:52] Now, the middle of the road, Brother
[1:31:54] Bram said, "The most important thing of
[1:31:56] the day is a God sent preacher
[1:31:59] who knows how to rightly divide the word
[1:32:03] of God.
[1:32:04] He's not going to put you on this side
[1:32:07] and he ain't going to put you on that
[1:32:08] side. He going to keep you right in the
[1:32:10] middle of the road." Ain't that right?
[1:32:13] who knows how to rightly divide the word
[1:32:16] of God. Their gift is far beyond
[1:32:19] anything that could be done in anything
[1:32:22] else. Now, I want to say this, this
[1:32:25] message is a balanced message.
[1:32:29] Yes, it is. I know people people you
[1:32:32] know when I first come into the message
[1:32:33] you know I uh uh uh I I saw so much so
[1:32:37] much stuff and nonsense
[1:32:40] uh uh that I I was personally scared to
[1:32:44] to get into the message to dig into the
[1:32:46] message and and and others were too that
[1:32:49] I had talked with oh you don't need to
[1:32:51] know get all that because you'll go w
[1:32:52] you'll go wacko you'll lose your mind
[1:32:54] you'll do all that but then I found out
[1:32:57] it's the message that keeps me balanced
[1:32:59] Amen.
[1:33:01] It ain't putting my ideas to it. It
[1:33:03] ain't me interpreting it. It's just
[1:33:05] following the message. Say what a
[1:33:07] prophet said. It will keep you balanced.
[1:33:12] Ain't that right? See, and no person can
[1:33:16] walk this way of holiness without it.
[1:33:20] Amen. Are you with me? Now, remember,
[1:33:23] Brother Brham's mother had a had a
[1:33:25] dream. That's right. Of brother Brandham
[1:33:27] standing by three steps. He was
[1:33:29] preaching, telling everyone that they
[1:33:32] had to walk these three steps before
[1:33:33] they hit that highway. That way of
[1:33:36] holiness.
[1:33:37] And on the highway, he says, was was
[1:33:40] pearly was a pearly white line that led
[1:33:42] to the doors of heaven. That way of
[1:33:45] holiness. It led to the is the only way
[1:33:48] that led to the doors of heaven. And
[1:33:51] those three steps that brother Bram was
[1:33:52] standing by, brother Bram said was
[1:33:54] justification, sanctification, the
[1:33:56] baptism of the Holy Ghost. You had to
[1:33:58] climb those three steps to get on the
[1:34:00] way of holiness. Ain't that right? He
[1:34:03] says, "And then there come here here
[1:34:05] come a lady with high heeled shoes on."
[1:34:07] And brother Brandham tells her, the
[1:34:09] messenger, the prophet of this day told
[1:34:11] her in this dream, "Wait a minute,
[1:34:14] sister. You can't walk that way with
[1:34:16] that. You You can't do it." And she
[1:34:19] looked around at the rest of those women
[1:34:22] and said, he said, "Don't you believe
[1:34:24] him? He's a mad man."
[1:34:27] We could sit this that's just his
[1:34:29] opinion,
[1:34:31] right? And she says, "I'll show you that
[1:34:34] I can be justified, sanctified, and
[1:34:36] filled with the baptism of the Holy
[1:34:38] Ghost and walk the highway." And brother
[1:34:41] Brown said, "I just let her go. I
[1:34:43] couldn't do no more about it. Couldn't
[1:34:46] stop her." Ain't that right? See? And so
[1:34:48] the woman got on this amen highway and
[1:34:51] she looked back at the others and said,
[1:34:54] "See, I told you I can do it." Now
[1:34:56] notice, Brother Be said she fulfilled
[1:34:59] exactly what God said in Isaiah 3:16.
[1:35:03] The daughters of Zion are hottaughty and
[1:35:06] walk with stretched forth necks and
[1:35:09] wanting eyes, walking and mincing as
[1:35:12] they go, making a tinkling with their
[1:35:14] feet. That's right. And as she went down
[1:35:18] this way, it got narrower and narrower
[1:35:22] and narrower.
[1:35:24] And then she starts she starts uh uh
[1:35:28] teetering.
[1:35:32] Ain't that right? Yeah. And in this
[1:35:35] dream uh that Brother Bram's mother had,
[1:35:39] she she said, "The horriblest dreams
[1:35:41] that I've ever heard in my life was that
[1:35:43] woman falling in those flames and smoke
[1:35:45] going down and down like that." See? And
[1:35:49] then in the dream, Brother Brandham
[1:35:51] turned around to the others and said,
[1:35:53] "She just obeyed everything but one
[1:35:56] word."
[1:35:58] She obeyed the message but one word.
[1:36:01] everything but one word. Sure.
[1:36:03] Pentecostal women can be saved,
[1:36:05] sanctified, filled with the Holy Ghost,
[1:36:07] and then fall.
[1:36:10] Cuz we know it comes upon the the the
[1:36:13] flesh, the spirit realm and not into
[1:36:15] that soul.
[1:36:18] Amen. Ain't that right? See, everything
[1:36:21] but one word. See, but notice now God
[1:36:25] promised. Amen. as he promised Eve that
[1:36:28] the word would be restored unto her and
[1:36:31] it was through Mary.
[1:36:34] So he promised this spiritual Eve, amen,
[1:36:37] the same thing that the word would be
[1:36:40] restored to her and in the last days he
[1:36:44] would restored to the church to the
[1:36:47] original word again.
[1:36:50] Amen. Can you say amen? Dedicated,
[1:36:53] holy unto the Lord. Amen. Why do we
[1:36:56] believe the message and everybody else
[1:36:58] thinks it's crazy? We're separated.
[1:37:03] We're dedicated.
[1:37:04] Can you say amen? This word's going to
[1:37:07] have an effect. This message is going to
[1:37:10] work. It works. But it's working in
[1:37:13] people that God has separated unto him.
[1:37:17] Amen. That's right.
[1:37:20] You see, when people don't listen to a
[1:37:22] vindicated prophet, they're going to
[1:37:23] perish. That's right.
[1:37:28] Can you say amen?
[1:37:31] This message is the only thing that'll
[1:37:33] keep a person from destruction.
[1:37:37] This message is the only thing that's
[1:37:39] going to bring a people in a rapture to
[1:37:41] escape the tribulation that's at hand.
[1:37:44] Ain't that right?
[1:37:48] So
[1:37:50] the Bible tells us through stories of
[1:37:54] what happens when people don't listen to
[1:37:56] the message. Noah, for example, God sent
[1:37:59] a prophet with the message and those who
[1:38:02] didn't listen to it were destroyed. They
[1:38:05] perished. Those who didn't listen to
[1:38:07] Moses message perished.
[1:38:10] And brother Brown, speaking of the
[1:38:12] people that didn't listen to Moses'
[1:38:14] message, says every one of them rotted
[1:38:16] in the wilderness and perished. Their
[1:38:18] souls are dead and gone. And they were
[1:38:21] right in the path of duty going to
[1:38:24] church and the very things that God
[1:38:26] ordained them to do, but accepted a
[1:38:28] false teacher who wasn't vindicated by
[1:38:30] the word to be proven to be right. Yet
[1:38:33] he was the doctor of divinity and
[1:38:35] whatever more you want to call about a
[1:38:37] real prophet, but wasn't proved
[1:38:39] spiritually by the word uh uh and by the
[1:38:43] signs of God and they perished in the
[1:38:46] wilderness. Righteous, honorable,
[1:38:48] religious people died and will never be
[1:38:51] in heaven. That's right. Can you say
[1:38:53] amen? See, and and and so this is what
[1:38:56] real holiness means to us. I hope this
[1:38:59] all right this morning. So
[1:39:02] again when when holiness is mentioned we
[1:39:05] we always consider it maybe to be a
[1:39:07] physical physical things of dos and
[1:39:10] don'ts and and yes we should be careful
[1:39:13] as to where we go. We we should be
[1:39:16] careful as to what we listen to and what
[1:39:18] we watch and we we we we should be
[1:39:22] careful as to who we hang around.
[1:39:25] We should be careful as to who our
[1:39:27] children hang around. That's right. It's
[1:39:30] just the truth. We should be careful
[1:39:33] about the things we do. But our physical
[1:39:36] actions or our physical appearance
[1:39:39] doesn't mean that a complete separation
[1:39:40] has taken place. For the Bible says that
[1:39:44] he that loves the world or the things of
[1:39:47] the world, that's right, hath not the
[1:39:49] love of God. So then it goes more than
[1:39:52] just the outward. It goes down into that
[1:39:55] soul. What things do you love? Amen.
[1:40:00] Birds of a feather flock together,
[1:40:02] right? So, so it's like James 3:11 says,
[1:40:06] "Doth a fountain send forth at the same
[1:40:09] place sweet water and bitter? Can the
[1:40:12] fig tree, my brethren, bear olive
[1:40:14] berries, either of vine figs? So can no
[1:40:18] fountain yield both yield salt water and
[1:40:21] fresh."
[1:40:23] Matthew 12:33. Either make the tree good
[1:40:26] and his fruit good, fruit good, or else
[1:40:29] make the tree corrupt and his fruit
[1:40:31] corrupt. For the tree is known by his
[1:40:33] fruit. Oh generation of vipers, how can
[1:40:36] ye being evil speak good things? For out
[1:40:39] of the abundance of the heart the mouth
[1:40:41] speaketh.
[1:40:42] A good man out of the good treasure of
[1:40:44] the heart bringeth forth good things,
[1:40:46] and an evil man out of the evil treasure
[1:40:49] bringeth forth evil things. Can you say
[1:40:52] amen? Amen.
[1:40:57] So true holiness begins when a man, a
[1:41:00] woman, boy, girl is truly truly
[1:41:04] separated. Amen.
[1:41:07] In his heart. Amen. Can you say amen?
[1:41:11] Amen. Now, God requires,
[1:41:16] and I I wanted to say maybe to you young
[1:41:18] people, you know, you might be around
[1:41:20] people that are good good denominational
[1:41:25] people. They believe in God. And maybe
[1:41:27] they tell you, "Well, see, I love God. I
[1:41:30] don't have to wear dresses, and we don't
[1:41:34] have to do this." And God knows our
[1:41:35] heart and and so, you know, we we we do
[1:41:41] this. We can listen to country music and
[1:41:43] it doesn't bother us. Oh, we have great
[1:41:46] services. We're thriving. Oh, we're good
[1:41:49] Christians. And they may be in what they
[1:41:53] know in their good Baptists, good
[1:41:56] Pentecostals, good apostolic, good
[1:41:59] Jehovah's Witness or whatever. And
[1:42:02] that's fine.
[1:42:04] But see, there has to be a total
[1:42:06] separation. Amen. It's not what I think
[1:42:10] is good. It's what God considers to be
[1:42:13] good. And therefore, see, I I can't
[1:42:16] consider all things good. Actually, when
[1:42:19] we look and and uh uh or we we have
[1:42:22] nothing in us to be able to discern
[1:42:25] between good and evil just on our own
[1:42:28] because we're in an age where the Bible
[1:42:31] says, "Woe unto them that call evil good
[1:42:33] and good evil." There's no discernment
[1:42:36] be because it's a sinful nature. It's
[1:42:39] it's such a deception that we wouldn't
[1:42:42] even know. So, you've got people that
[1:42:45] are singing in the choir, honest, good
[1:42:46] people, and yet the women are cutting
[1:42:48] their hair, smoking cigarettes.
[1:42:53] But God looks at our heart,
[1:42:56] see, but there's no separation.
[1:43:00] So, there has to be a separation first
[1:43:02] down in the soul, in that heart. All
[1:43:05] right. Amen.
[1:43:07] Amen.
[1:43:11] In the Old Testament, God told Abraham
[1:43:13] to separate himself from where he was
[1:43:15] living and go to another land. He was to
[1:43:17] separate from all he knew. He was to
[1:43:19] separate from all that he he he loved.
[1:43:23] He was to separate from everything, all
[1:43:26] of his worship, from the things he
[1:43:28] worshiped, from the He was to separate,
[1:43:31] Amen. from his kindred. Separate from
[1:43:33] that land. Come out of that. Ain't that
[1:43:36] right? But we know that Abraham brought
[1:43:38] his dad along and he brought his nephew
[1:43:40] Lot along. And the Bible says that God
[1:43:43] never did visit with Abraham until he
[1:43:46] completely separated from them. He never
[1:43:49] come and revealed himself. He never come
[1:43:51] and made himself more known to Abraham
[1:43:54] until there was a complete separation.
[1:43:57] And I say this, this message will mean
[1:43:59] nothing to you until there is a complete
[1:44:02] separation.
[1:44:04] Amen. That is true. You can believe that
[1:44:07] God sent a prophet. Okay. You can
[1:44:09] believe that that that oh yes, the the
[1:44:12] seals have been open. Oh yes. And all of
[1:44:14] these things. But that the true
[1:44:16] revelation of this message will not
[1:44:18] strike that heart until there is a
[1:44:21] complete separation.
[1:44:25] Can you say amen? You see, God's people
[1:44:27] are always a separated people. God
[1:44:29] separated Abraham. God separated Noah.
[1:44:31] God separated Moses. God separated the
[1:44:34] nation of Israel and today he has
[1:44:37] separated a people out of the Gentiles
[1:44:40] for his name.
[1:44:43] It's a separation.
[1:44:45] Brother Bram even preached the message
[1:44:47] God's word calls for a total separation
[1:44:50] from unbelief.
[1:44:52] Now church this leotan there is never
[1:44:56] been more unbelief than what there is in
[1:44:58] this age. Can't trust God for anything
[1:45:01] anymore. can't believe God for anything
[1:45:04] anymore.
[1:45:05] So weak in faith. So so to where brother
[1:45:08] Bram said in this age faith would be
[1:45:11] slow. But God has got a people that is
[1:45:15] separated unto himself.
[1:45:20] Yes sir. And this is what makes the us
[1:45:23] the church of the living God. For the
[1:45:25] word church means the called out
[1:45:27] separated.
[1:45:28] John 15:16 Jesus said you have not
[1:45:31] chosen me. I've chosen you and ordained
[1:45:34] you that you should go forth and go and
[1:45:36] bring forth fruit and that your fruit
[1:45:38] should remain. Whose fruit's going to
[1:45:40] remain? Those that God has chosen.
[1:45:44] Amen.
[1:45:46] First Corinthians 6:19. What? Know ye
[1:45:50] not that your body is the temple of the
[1:45:52] Holy Ghost which is in you? How many's
[1:45:55] got the Holy Ghost?
[1:45:57] Well, your body is the temple of the
[1:45:59] Holy Ghost which is in you
[1:46:02] which you have of God. You are not your
[1:46:05] own. Can you say amen? Therefore, he
[1:46:09] calls us a holy people.
[1:46:13] Amen. For you are bought with the price.
[1:46:16] Therefore, glorify God in your body and
[1:46:20] in your spirit which are God's. Amen.
[1:46:25] Don't just glorify him in your spirit.
[1:46:27] Rejoice. Oh, I love the Lord. I love the
[1:46:29] Lord. But and your body. Amen. Reflect
[1:46:31] in the things of the world. You've got
[1:46:33] to glorify God in your body as much as
[1:46:35] you are in your spirit.
[1:46:39] Amen.
[1:46:41] Can you say amen?
[1:46:43] 2 Corinthians 6:14, "Be ye not unequally
[1:46:48] yolked together with unbelievers.
[1:46:50] For what fellowship hath righteousness
[1:46:52] with unrighteousness?
[1:46:55] Hello.
[1:46:56] We allow our children to hang out with
[1:46:58] everybody and under the sun and all
[1:47:00] that. Then we wonder why they go astray.
[1:47:03] Then we wonder what's going on, what's
[1:47:05] happening. They catch the spirit of
[1:47:08] things. There's a spirit behind sports.
[1:47:12] There is there's a spirit behind things
[1:47:16] there. There's nothing wrong with good
[1:47:18] just good fellowship of of of playing
[1:47:21] and and playing games and all that. But
[1:47:23] then there's becomes a spirit behind it
[1:47:25] and that's what's behind the world out
[1:47:27] there.
[1:47:30] Whether you like it or not, it's just
[1:47:32] true.
[1:47:34] I've told you before about, you know, a
[1:47:36] minister here from the States went over
[1:47:38] to another church overseas and and and
[1:47:42] the man, the pastor had two daughters
[1:47:46] and brother Wayne was talking to him,
[1:47:48] the pastor and all that. Here come the
[1:47:50] two daughters. And when he saw them,
[1:47:55] he detected lesbian
[1:47:57] spirit in both of them.
[1:48:02] And and
[1:48:04] you know, they went on and as they were
[1:48:08] he got to know the pastor and things and
[1:48:12] he brought it up.
[1:48:14] He said, "You know, brother, something
[1:48:18] wrong with your daughters.
[1:48:21] What's going on with them?" And the
[1:48:23] pastor just broke down and cried,
[1:48:25] started crying. He says, "I let them
[1:48:26] into sports playing soccer." Yeah. He
[1:48:29] said, "The thing is, I didn't know is
[1:48:31] that their coach is lesbian
[1:48:34] and she got with my girls. That spirit's
[1:48:37] got on my girls. There's a spirit behind
[1:48:40] things." Can you say amen? We must not
[1:48:43] go through this world, this life, naive.
[1:48:47] What God calls unclean, we ought to call
[1:48:50] unclean. Brother Bram said we should
[1:48:52] never go into bowling alleyies. I
[1:48:54] believe that still stands.
[1:48:57] Hello. There's some reason why you say,
[1:49:00] "Well, I don't see nothing wrong." Hey,
[1:49:02] you're not a prophet either.
[1:49:06] But there's some reason God showed that
[1:49:08] prophet about bowling alleys to stay out
[1:49:10] of. That's right. Amen.
[1:49:14] True. Amen.
[1:49:16] I even go as far as to say golf. Prophet
[1:49:20] said they go guys that play golf or
[1:49:22] sissies.
[1:49:23] And he said talked about women being all
[1:49:25] out there on that golf range too. Have
[1:49:28] we not seen more women today doing them
[1:49:31] doing that thing and they're dressing up
[1:49:32] as sex queens? Sexy. Putting themselves
[1:49:36] up on the internet.
[1:49:39] It's true. Brother A Bram knew exactly
[1:49:41] what he was talking about.
[1:49:44] And we ought to abide by that. We ought
[1:49:46] to live that. If God sent us a prophet,
[1:49:49] he called God sent a prophet to separate
[1:49:52] us from the things of the world that God
[1:49:54] would call unclean that we could live
[1:49:57] holy unto God.
[1:50:02] So be be ye not unequally yolked
[1:50:05] together with unbelievers. You say,
[1:50:07] "Well, I'm just giving my kids something
[1:50:09] to do." so they can have something
[1:50:11] because I don't, you know, I don't want
[1:50:12] to be too strict.
[1:50:16] You're messing around with spirits is
[1:50:18] what you're doing. That's right. There's
[1:50:20] demons out there that has got a lot of
[1:50:22] these young people.
[1:50:24] They know more know more about God than
[1:50:26] anything. It's because of of of their
[1:50:30] parents. It's it's a spirit that has
[1:50:33] taken over.
[1:50:35] Hello. Amen. Just true.
[1:50:40] Amen. Be ye not unequally yolked
[1:50:42] together with unbelievers. For what
[1:50:45] fellowship hath righteous with
[1:50:47] unrighteousness? What communion hath
[1:50:49] light with darkness? What concord hath
[1:50:51] Christ with balile? What part hath he
[1:50:54] that believeth with an infidel? What
[1:50:57] agreement hath the temple of God with
[1:50:59] idols? For ye are the temple, everybody
[1:51:02] say, I am the temple of the living God.
[1:51:06] As God hath said, I will dwell in them
[1:51:10] and walk in them and they I will be
[1:51:12] their God and they shall be my people.
[1:51:15] You are a dedicated people unto God. And
[1:51:19] God has dedicated himself to you. He
[1:51:22] will be no God to any other people but
[1:51:24] the people that he has called out to be
[1:51:28] his people.
[1:51:30] Can you say amen? Amen. Wherefore come
[1:51:33] out from among them, and be ye separate,
[1:51:37] sayeth the Lord, and touch not the
[1:51:39] unclean thing, and I will receive you.
[1:51:43] And brother Bram says, see, sports have
[1:51:45] become a god.
[1:51:48] Hello. That's right. He said their god
[1:51:50] is a bag of air.
[1:51:54] And that's the truth.
[1:51:56] Why? because they put more energy, more
[1:51:59] emphasis on that than they do the house
[1:52:01] of God. They can shout out there, scream
[1:52:04] out there, act like act like well, just
[1:52:08] act like a believer out there. Amen. In
[1:52:10] their God. And then when they come into
[1:52:12] the house of God, it's just all quiet.
[1:52:16] And then when someone says, "Hey, man."
[1:52:19] The whole church looks at them like,
[1:52:21] "Who are you?"
[1:52:23] Go ahead. And they'll spend hundreds of
[1:52:26] dollars to go because their their god
[1:52:29] requires it.
[1:52:33] It's true.
[1:52:35] Education has been a god. Women have
[1:52:37] become gods.
[1:52:40] There's so many gods out there. But God
[1:52:42] says, "But I will be their God."
[1:52:45] You're separated. Don't you have any
[1:52:47] other gods before me?
[1:52:51] Praise the Lord.
[1:52:52] Ain't that right?
[1:52:55] So wherefore come out from among them
[1:52:57] and be ye separate, sayith the Lord, and
[1:52:59] touch not the unclean thing, and I will
[1:53:01] receive you and will be a father unto
[1:53:04] you. You talking about a father, he'll
[1:53:06] be a father to us. He'll protect us.
[1:53:09] He'll He'll provide for us. He'll watch
[1:53:12] over us. He a father. Amen. You know, a
[1:53:16] natural father. Amen. Isn't Isn't the
[1:53:18] Bible says, you know, that if a father a
[1:53:20] natural father would love to give good
[1:53:22] things unto his children, how much more
[1:53:24] do your heavenly father want to give
[1:53:26] heavenly things and good things unto
[1:53:28] you? He'll he'll dispatch the angels of
[1:53:31] heaven just for you. Amen. When it looks
[1:53:33] like there's a trouble, amen, he'll keep
[1:53:36] you from a wreck. He'll keep you from tr
[1:53:38] Amen. When it seem like you're going
[1:53:40] down for the last time, he'll send the
[1:53:42] angels of God, amen, to protect you. And
[1:53:45] the devil has no power over you. He has
[1:53:49] no power over me. You may go through
[1:53:51] trials. You may go be through troubles,
[1:53:53] but it's only your heavenly father
[1:53:55] trying to work something good to trying
[1:53:57] to separate you from the things of the
[1:53:59] world that maybe you're holding on to to
[1:54:02] get your eyes upon him. It ain't to
[1:54:04] destroy you. He'll never let the devil
[1:54:07] and some sleeves demon
[1:54:12] destroy you.
[1:54:15] Amen. He says, "I'll be a father to
[1:54:17] you." That's right.
[1:54:20] And you shall be my sons and daughters,
[1:54:22] sayith the Lord Almighty. Can you say
[1:54:24] amen?
[1:54:25] Oh, do you love him? Wonderful. Amen.
[1:54:29] Amen. Amen. And I've got I've got a lot
[1:54:31] more, but we we'll get ready to close.
[1:54:35] But I will say this. When did he
[1:54:37] separate us?
[1:54:39] When did God separated us to be a a a
[1:54:43] people to himself?
[1:54:45] He did it by predestination. Amen.
[1:54:49] Aren't you glad for that? Amen.
[1:54:51] Ephesians 1:4, according as he hath
[1:54:53] chosen us in him before the foundation
[1:54:55] of the world, that we should be holy and
[1:54:59] without blame before him in love.
[1:55:04] We were chosen to be the his bride in
[1:55:07] this age. We were predestinated to be to
[1:55:09] the adoption of sons. As Paul would say,
[1:55:12] we were predestinated to be conformed to
[1:55:14] the image of his son.
[1:55:17] He separated us then. Amen. Romans 8:30.
[1:55:22] Moreover, whom he did predestinate them,
[1:55:24] he also called, and whom he called, them
[1:55:26] he also justified. And whom he justified
[1:55:28] them, he also glorified.
[1:55:31] I want to say this, this isn't a rat
[1:55:33] race.
[1:55:35] Christianity isn't a competitive thing.
[1:55:39] God already separated you from the
[1:55:41] foundation of the world for your place.
[1:55:43] Amen. Can you say amen? Amen. Romans
[1:55:47] 9:13 says, "As it is written, Jacob I
[1:55:49] have I loved, but Esau have I hated.
[1:55:52] What shall we say then? Is there any
[1:55:54] unrighteousness with God? God forbid.
[1:55:56] For he saith to Moses, I will have mercy
[1:55:59] on whom I will have mercy. I will have
[1:56:01] compassion on whom I will have
[1:56:02] compassion." Listen. So then it is not
[1:56:05] of him that welleleth, nor him that
[1:56:06] runth, but of God that showeth mercy.
[1:56:10] John 6:44 Jesus says, "No man can come
[1:56:12] to the to me except the father which
[1:56:14] hath sent him. Draw him." You may
[1:56:18] prophesy, but that may that has nothing
[1:56:20] to do with it. You may speak in tongues,
[1:56:22] that has nothing to do with it,
[1:56:25] right? You may dance, shout, play music,
[1:56:29] preach, whatever. That has nothing to do
[1:56:30] with it. Brother Brandham says, "Unless
[1:56:33] that was God's seed, his gene from the
[1:56:36] beginning predestinated, you're
[1:56:39] finished." Another place he said, "God
[1:56:42] in his mercy before the foundation of
[1:56:43] the world saw me and placed a little
[1:56:45] seed in there that my faith would fly
[1:56:48] above these things of the world." God
[1:56:51] put that little seed in you, in each of
[1:56:53] us that our faith might fly above these
[1:56:56] things of the world. Church, we are not
[1:56:59] victims in this leodysseyan age. God put
[1:57:02] us in this leotanian age. But before he
[1:57:04] put us in this leotanian age, he chose
[1:57:07] us. He called us to be a special people
[1:57:09] unto himself. Amen. And he already
[1:57:12] determined there ain't no devil in hell
[1:57:14] going to separate us from the love of
[1:57:16] God. There ain't no trial. There ain't
[1:57:18] no no hell. There ain't no flame. There
[1:57:20] ain't no tribulation. There ain't no
[1:57:22] nothing. Famine can't separate us from
[1:57:25] the love of God. We are a people that
[1:57:28] has been separated. That God may be our
[1:57:30] God and we may be his people. That he
[1:57:33] may be a God of miracles to us. That he
[1:57:35] may be a God of protection. He may be a
[1:57:38] God that will provide for you and I.
[1:57:41] That's the people that he has called out
[1:57:42] for his name. Can you say amen? That's
[1:57:46] right.
[1:57:47] That's good. That's what I believe. The
[1:57:50] Bible says we are the work of his hands.
[1:57:53] So no denomination made us,
[1:57:57] no preacher made us, no creed. We're not
[1:57:59] a product of a creed. We're not a
[1:58:01] product of traditions. We are the work
[1:58:04] of his hands. Ain't that right? Another
[1:58:07] place the Bible says, "It is he that
[1:58:09] made us and not we ourselves."
[1:58:12] Paul would tell us in in there he says,
[1:58:14] "We are his workmanship." Yes, sir. If
[1:58:18] the musicians will come, brother Bram
[1:58:21] says this, remember if he has called you
[1:58:23] for this, there is nothing that can keep
[1:58:27] it from happening. There's not enough
[1:58:30] devils in torment, but what God's word
[1:58:32] will be made manifest. You're born for a
[1:58:35] purpose, and nobody can take your place.
[1:58:37] You might have impersonators and
[1:58:39] everything else, but they'll never take
[1:58:42] your place. Right? God's word will
[1:58:46] triumph.
[1:58:48] It cannot fail. There is where every
[1:58:52] Christian ought to stand knowing that.
[1:58:56] And trials will come and seem every way
[1:58:59] to you. But remember, God has a purpose
[1:59:03] and it will all work right.
[1:59:07] Can you say amen? God has a purpose
[1:59:11] and it'll all work out right.
[1:59:15] You love him. Yes, sir. Oh, God. Think
[1:59:19] of it. If he called us to be holy,
[1:59:23] separating us, then how can we be damned
[1:59:26] with the world, right? He promised to be
[1:59:29] our God. H how how how can how how can
[1:59:33] we be in the muck and the and you know
[1:59:36] live unto him true and then he destroys
[1:59:38] us in the end with the world. He's
[1:59:41] called us to be separated.
[1:59:44] Oh, aren't you glad? That's why he could
[1:59:47] say, "I've got an expected end for you.
[1:59:50] I've separated you to myself and I've
[1:59:52] got an expected end." And that ain't
[1:59:54] tribulation. That's a rapture.
[1:59:57] That ain't losing your mind
[2:00:00] like the world is. That ain't going
[2:00:02] insane like the world is. That ain't
[2:00:05] That ain't being demonpossessed like the
[2:00:07] world is today. No, no, no. He's our
[2:00:11] God. You love him? Can you lift your
[2:00:14] hands unto the Lord and just worship
[2:00:18] him?
[2:00:20] Father, we're so thankful
[2:00:22] that you've called us to be a holy
[2:00:24] people.
[2:00:27] We're so thankful, Father, that you've
[2:00:30] separated us. It wasn't us that
[2:00:32] separated ourselves.
[2:00:35] That Lord, you separated us from the
[2:00:37] foundation of the world.
[2:00:40] That you could be our God. That we could
[2:00:42] be your people, your sons and your
[2:00:44] daughters.
[2:00:46] Father,
[2:00:48] I pray that that revelation just strikes
[2:00:51] us so
[2:00:54] so deep in our hearts, Lord, that we can
[2:00:57] truly see and believe that we're part of
[2:01:00] that separated group
[2:01:03] to be holy unto the Lord.
[2:01:07] Oh, Father, make us more pliable to you.
[2:01:11] [Music]
[2:01:12] Make us more willing to do your will in
[2:01:16] your will alone.
[2:01:18] When fear is striking the world, you've
[2:01:20] called us to be separate to where Satan
[2:01:23] cannot bring fear and allow that fear to
[2:01:27] stay. He may try, but we're separated.
[2:01:31] Oh, Father, we're so thankful for it,
[2:01:33] Lord.
[2:01:35] We give you honor. We give you glory.
[2:01:39] Amen. Amen.
[2:01:41] What song?
[2:01:44] I will praise the Lord.
[2:01:48] I
[2:01:50] was made to praise
[2:01:53] you.
[2:01:55] I
[2:01:58] was made to glorify
[2:02:02] your name
[2:02:06] in every circumstance
[2:02:10] to find
[2:02:12] a
[2:02:14] chance to thank you. I
[2:02:20] was made to love
[2:02:23] you.
[2:02:25] I
[2:02:28] was made to worship
[2:02:31] at your feet
[2:02:35] and to obey
[2:02:38] you, Lord.
[2:02:40] I was made for you. Sing it unto him
[2:02:45] now. Oh, I
[2:02:50] was made to praise
[2:02:53] you.
[2:02:55] I
[2:02:58] was made to glorify
[2:03:02] your name
[2:03:05] in every circumstance
[2:03:09] to find
[2:03:12] a
[2:03:14] chance to thank you. I
[2:03:20] was made to love
[2:03:23] you.
[2:03:24] Oh, I
[2:03:27] was made to worship
[2:03:30] at your feet
[2:03:34] into obey
[2:03:37] you, Lord.
[2:03:39] I was made for you. as they just place
[2:03:46] softly. Now,
[2:03:49] I hope the word has helped you today.
[2:03:51] And
[2:03:53] I want to say this, you know that
[2:03:58] not every
[2:04:00] every time our children go astray or
[2:04:02] whatever is because we've allowed the
[2:04:05] world or we've allowed this. There
[2:04:08] sometimes
[2:04:10] parents can do everything that they
[2:04:12] know, live true to that word and live
[2:04:16] live faithful to God
[2:04:20] and their children will go out just
[2:04:25] brother Brandham even his boys Billy
[2:04:28] Paul and Joseph even
[2:04:33] and so it's not every every situation is
[2:04:37] the name.
[2:04:39] And I know sometimes Satan will beat our
[2:04:43] mind up and to thinking, "Oh, we failed
[2:04:46] here. We failed here. We failed here."
[2:04:49] Every parent fails.
[2:04:52] Uh, and whatever.
[2:04:55] And I I know there's parents that are
[2:04:57] doing their best to be faithful to God,
[2:05:00] be faithful to that word, be faithful.
[2:05:02] You know, some parents just don't care
[2:05:04] and they just allow it everything.
[2:05:07] But and if you know if you're one of
[2:05:10] those parents that have just lived true
[2:05:12] to God and and Satan over working your
[2:05:15] mind and saying see you just you blew
[2:05:17] it. You this, you that. Don't you listen
[2:05:19] to that devil. That's just a lie from
[2:05:22] the devil.
[2:05:24] And you always remember I don't care
[2:05:26] what it is. I even even if you did make
[2:05:30] mistakes and man I've lived a little
[2:05:33] loose over here. I shouldn't have all
[2:05:34] that. I believe you make them things
[2:05:37] right and you you stand on that token
[2:05:40] that God's given you, you can lay claim
[2:05:43] to your children. So I you know I I
[2:05:46] really want that clarified to you today
[2:05:51] that there is you you as as a child of
[2:05:54] God, a daughter of God, son of God, you
[2:05:58] have that right to lay claim to your
[2:06:00] children. Can you say amen? Amen. And
[2:06:04] every situation's different, but on all
[2:06:07] in all, we we have the word of God that
[2:06:11] we can lay claim to.
[2:06:14] Amen. You love the Lord. Amen. Let's
[2:06:17] sing it again. Oh, I
[2:06:22] was made to praise
[2:06:25] you.
[2:06:27] I
[2:06:29] was made to glorify
[2:06:33] your name
[2:06:36] in every circumstance
[2:06:41] to find
[2:06:43] a
[2:06:44] chance to thank you. I
[2:06:50] was made to love
[2:06:53] you. Oh, I
[2:06:58] was made to worship
[2:07:01] at your feet
[2:07:05] and to obey
[2:07:08] you, Lord.
[2:07:10] I was made. Can we just stand to our
[2:07:14] feet and sang, "Oh, I
[2:07:19] I was made to praise you."
[2:07:24] Oh, I
[2:07:26] was made to glorify
[2:07:30] your name
[2:07:34] in every circumstance
[2:07:38] to find
[2:07:40] a
[2:07:42] chance to praise you. I
[2:07:48] was made to love you.
[2:07:53] I
[2:07:55] was made to worship
[2:07:58] at your feet
[2:08:02] and to obey
[2:08:05] you, Lord.
[2:08:07] I was made for you.
[2:08:15] Sing one more song. I love
[2:08:20] you, Lord.
[2:08:24] And I lift
[2:08:28] my voice,
[2:08:32] oh, to worship
[2:08:37] you,
[2:08:40] oh my soul, do you love him?
[2:08:46] In an age where men are becoming lovers
[2:08:48] of pleasure
[2:08:50] more than lovers of God, lovers of their
[2:08:53] own selves,
[2:08:55] we've been called
[2:08:57] to love him.
[2:09:00] Oh, I love the Lord.
[2:09:03] Let it be a sweet,
[2:09:06] sweet
[2:09:08] sound
[2:09:10] in your ear. One more time, shall we?
[2:09:14] before we close.
[2:09:17] Oh,
[2:09:19] I love
[2:09:21] you, Lord.
[2:09:25] And I lift my voice
[2:09:33] oh to worship
[2:09:36] [Music]
[2:09:38] you
[2:09:40] oh my soul.
[2:09:47] Oh take joy.
[2:09:52] I know he does
[2:09:55] in
[2:09:57] what you hear.
[2:10:03] Let it be a sweet,
[2:10:06] sweet
[2:10:08] sound. Oh, let it be a sweet,
[2:10:14] sweet sound
[2:10:18] in your ears.
[2:10:22] God bless you is our prayer.
[2:10:25] Remember communion this evening at 4:30.
[2:10:29] Amen. And we want to remember those that
[2:10:32] are out of town be coming back today or
[2:10:35] tomorrow. And so God will keep them.
[2:10:39] Keep Brother Bob in prayer as he's not
[2:10:41] feeling good today. And um
[2:10:46] Amen. I don't think there's any more
[2:10:48] announcements or anything. So, God bless
[2:10:52] you. Love you. Amen. Remember, uh,
[2:10:55] prayer meeting tomorrow, 2 at 7. Amen.
[2:10:59] Brother Will, do you want to dismiss us
[2:11:01] in prayer? Amen.
