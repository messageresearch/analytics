[2:21] tell you why.
[2:24] Because my shins are gone.
[2:29] And when I meet the scoffers who ask me
[2:33] where they are, I
[2:36] say my sins are
[2:40] gone.
[2:42] There of blood on the cross of
[2:46] Calvary as far removed as darkishes from
[2:50] dawn.
[2:53] in the sea of God's forgetfulness.
[2:56] That's good enough for me. Praise

[3:56] and he tries to make me doubt, I say,
[4:01] "Oh, my sins are
[4:04] gone. Oh, you got me into trouble, but
[4:09] Jesus got me out. I'm
[4:12] glad my sins are gone.
[4:17] Oh, they're underneath the blood on the

[4:56] With all my heart I say I
[5:00] know my sins are
[5:03] gone. Oh, they're underneath the blood
[5:08] on the cross of Calvary.
[5:11] or as far removed as darkness is from
[5:14] [Music]
[5:16] dawn in the sea of God's forgiveness.
[5:20] That's good enough for me. Praise
[5:24] God. My sins are

[31:02] long ago about Shadrach, Meack, and old
[31:06] Abindigo and how the wicked king command
[31:09] they be thrown into the flame because
[31:12] they would not bow and then deny their
[31:14] father's name. Mama said the king stood
[31:17] high up on the balcony so tall. When he
[31:21] looked in, he was shot by all the things
[31:23] he saw because they thought that he
[31:25] wouldn't find it. Lying dead upon the
[31:28] ground. But instead of three, he counted
[31:30] for up walking all around. Then I said,
[31:34] "Mama, wait a minute. There's one thing
[31:36] that I must know." And three went in and
[31:39] three came out. Then where' that fourth
[31:41] man go? And I never will forget it. Mama
[31:44] danced across the floor. She thought
[31:46] probably God's work had never been
[31:49] before. She said he's still in the fire
[31:53] and he's walking in the flame and he'll
[31:56] be there to help you. When you call upon
[31:58] his name, not one flame or fire will
[32:00] touch. You'll come through it and you'll
[32:02] tell. Yesterday, today, forever, God is
[32:05] still alive and well. I said he's still
[32:09] in the fire and he's walking in the
[32:12] flame and he'll be there to help you
[32:14] when you call upon his name. Not one
[32:17] flame of fire will judge you. You'll
[32:19] come through it and you'll tell.
[32:20] Yesterday, today, forever, God is still
[32:23] alive and
[32:25] will. Oh, my friend may be destined to
[32:28] face life's hottest flame. But I'm glad
[32:30] that I can tell you through the power of
[32:33] his name. Not one flame of fire will
[32:35] touch it. You'll come through it and
[32:37] you'll tell. Yesterday, today, forever,
[32:40] God is still alive and well. I said he's
[32:44] still in the fire and he's walking in
[32:47] the flame and he'll be there to help you
[32:50] when you call upon his name. Not one
[32:52] flame or fire will touch. You'll come
[32:54] through it and you'll tell. Yesterday,
[32:57] today, forever, God is still alive and
[32:59] well. I said he's still in the fire and
[33:03] he's walking in the flame and he'll be
[33:06] there to help you when you call upon his
[33:09] name. Not one flavor of fire will touch
[33:11] you. You'll come through it and you'll
[33:13] go yesterday, today, forever. God is
[33:16] still alive and
[33:20] [Applause]
[33:23] well. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen.
[33:31] Amen. Do you still believe he's in the
[33:32] fire this morning? Amen. Whatever you
[33:35] have need of, he's there to meet that
[33:37] need. Amen. As we invite our pastor to

[34:31] why. So they went to God's man cuz they

[35:16] time they looked once more. A tiny cloud
[35:20] was rising from the
[35:24] sea. They began to
[35:27] understand. The time for rain was at
[35:31] hand. Just like God said it would be.
[35:38] Oh, I see a cloud like a man's
[35:44] hand. Oh, I see a clown like a man's
[35:50] hand. Oh, I see a cloud like a man's
[35:56] hand. And I
[35:59] know it's going to rain.
[36:04] Go. Today we have no fear for a cloud
[36:08] did
[36:09] appear. The prophet scream, "My bride,
[36:13] go through that
[36:15] door." Oh, have faith and just believe.
[36:20] A new spirit you'll
[36:22] receive. The rain is just about to pour.

[44:30] best musicians in the message of the
[44:34] hour. And I thank God for raising up
[44:37] young men to lend their talents. They're
[44:39] want not wanting big name. They're not
[44:42] wanting big highlight. They just want to
[44:44] be a blessing to the bride of Jesus
[44:46] Christ. And I'm so glad for that. Do you

[45:02] um uh brother Andrew is no stranger uh
[45:06] to us and we certainly love him. Uh
[45:09] sister Mariah and and uh brother
[45:12] Andrew's ministry. God has just really
[45:15] uh blessed him uh with the gift and um
[45:20] he's started preaching just at a very
[45:22] young age and um you know just uh he he
[45:27] was raised by his mother and
[45:30] grandmother, a broken home, but he had a
[45:34] desire to serve the Lord and um and he
[45:38] would say it, you know, every
[45:40] opportunity that he uh could come to
[45:42] church if if some way that you know uh
[45:46] his mom grandmother wasn't able to make
[45:49] it, he'd call on the phone just a young
[45:50] age just to um call someone to pick him
[45:54] up sitting on the front row always
[45:57] taking notice of of what the the
[46:00] ministry was saying and and these things
[46:02] and God has blessed him for that and uh
[46:06] you know I think he's a been a great
[46:08] example to the young people to you young
[46:10] people and Um uh you know uh he's he's
[46:15] been challenged in so many ways um uh
[46:19] through his ministry and uh people
[46:22] trying to sway him this way or sway him
[46:24] that way to their ideas. But he has
[46:27] stayed true to the message of the hour.
[46:29] I say God bless him for that and and um
[46:34] we need more young men like
[46:37] that. Amen.
[46:41] He was told he ought to go to college
[46:43] before he started preaching. Just go to
[46:45] college and get a degree. And it kind of
[46:48] tore him up. He didn't know what to do,
[46:50] you know. And uh received the advice
[46:53] that if God is opening doors, you follow
[46:55] that. And that young man has been
[46:57] whirled around preaching the gospel
[47:00] everywhere. God has blessed him and
[47:03] taken care of him. And and I know you're
[47:05] going to be blessed today. but he's
[47:07] asked us to um uh sing a song. It's an
[47:10] old song. Uh um and I'm sure you y'all

[53:37] know it's the final service of these

[53:41] in bodies, but there's one thing we know
[53:43] that our Lord never fails. Amen. And
[53:45] let's just bow our hearts this morning
[53:47] and speak to him. Heavenly Father, Lord,
[53:49] as your believers have gathered here
[53:51] this morning on this resurrection
[53:53] Sunday, Father, as we gather here this
[53:55] morning, our hearts are rejoicing, Lord,
[53:57] to know that we're not under the bondage
[53:59] of religion or tradition, oh God. But
[54:02] Lord, we're under the liberty of your
[54:04] word and the anointing of this message,
[54:06] Father. Lord, we're so thankful this
[54:08] morning for what you've done among us
[54:10] this weekend, Lord. And Lord, how we
[54:12] stand back and see the enemy fighting on
[54:14] every hand, Lord, doing everything that
[54:16] he can to hinder these meetings, to
[54:18] hinder these people, Lord. But Father,
[54:21] we stand here this morning with
[54:22] thanksgiving in our heart to say once
[54:24] again, our Lord triumphed over the
[54:27] devil's plans. Lord, we know that
[54:29] sicknesses were healed, diseases were
[54:31] healed. Lord, we know empty vessels were
[54:34] filled here this weekend. And Lord, for
[54:36] that, we give you thanksgiving. We give
[54:38] you praise. Now Lord, as we come this
[54:40] morning to the final service here, Lord,
[54:42] looking into your word, I pray this
[54:44] morning you send the spirit of wisdom
[54:46] and revelation into the building. Lord,
[54:48] may you drive out every spirit to try to
[54:50] hinder your word this morning. Father,
[54:53] may you move among us in the preaching
[54:55] of your word. For as your prophet told
[54:56] us, Lord, it's the highest office is the
[54:59] preaching of the word. Now, Lord, I pray
[55:01] you help me get myself out of the way
[55:03] this morning. Lord, may you remove me as
[55:05] the speaker. Remove them as the hearer.
[55:07] Father, Lord, may you speak through me.
[55:10] May you hear through them, oh God. And
[55:12] Lord, when we would leave this meeting,
[55:13] when the believers would get in their
[55:15] cars or get back on the planes or
[55:17] however they get home, Lord, as they
[55:19] travel home, Lord, may they be able to
[55:21] say, "Did not our hearts burn within us
[55:23] this weekend?" Lord, not as a man came
[55:25] and talk to us, but as you came, Lord,
[55:28] we thank you for your mercy and grace.
[55:30] Now, Father, have your way among us this
[55:32] morning. In the name of the Lord Jesus
[55:34] Christ, we pray. and all the believers
[55:36] says amen and amen. If you have your
[55:39] Bibles this morning, we want to turn to
[55:41] the book of Job, the 19th chapter. And

[57:05] here with us this morning. And Amen.
[57:07] Brother Matt McGary uh came all the way
[57:10] uh to give me a birthday present again.
[57:12] Brother Matt, thank you for coming.
[57:13] Amen. We sure love and appreciate him.
[57:15] Long story. I'll tell you another time.
[57:17] Amen. But it was Matt McGary that got
[57:19] kicked out of Louisiana camp, not Matt
[57:21] Morris.
[57:26] Amen. Love you, brother Matt.
[57:30] Job chapter 19 and verse number 23. You
[57:34] love the Lord this morning. Job 19 and
[57:36] verse 23. Job here writing, "Oh that my
[57:41] words were now written. Oh that they
[57:43] were printed in a book that they were
[57:46] graven with an iron pen and led in the
[57:49] rock forever." Now listen what Job says.
[57:52] For I hope that my redeemer liveth. I
[57:56] guess my redeemer liveth.
[57:58] For I know that my redeemer liveth, and
[58:01] that he shall stand at the latter day
[58:03] upon the earth. And though after my skin
[58:06] worms destroy this body, how many knows,
[58:09] brother Ram said, skin worms are already
[58:11] in you. But he said also is quickening
[58:14] power. Yet in my flesh shall I see God
[58:18] whom I shall see for myself, and mine
[58:22] eyes shall behold and not another. He is
[58:24] our Lord. Amen. though my reigns be
[58:27] consumed within me. In the book of
[58:29] Proverbs chapter 29, Proverbs chapter
[58:32] 29, it's a very very familiar reading.
[58:35] Proverbs 29 and verse number 18. And
[58:39] then we want to look in one other place
[58:41] in in first uh Peter uh Proverbs 29 and
[58:46] verse number 18. You love the Lord this
[58:48] morning. Amen.
[58:50] Solomon here writing he says where there
[58:53] is no vision the people perish but he
[58:57] that keepeth the law happy is he where
[59:01] there is no vision the people perish but
[59:05] he that keepeth the law happy is he and
[59:07] then first Peter chapter 1 Peter chapter
[59:11] 1 and verse number eight I I'm going to
[59:14] borrow this scripture from brother
[59:15] Jonathan this morning also brother
[59:17] Wendle speaking last night on the grace
[59:19] 1 Peter chapter 1 and verse number 8.
[59:23] Peter here writing says, "Whom you have
[59:25] not whom having not seen ye love."
[59:29] Notice that Job had not even seen him
[59:31] yet, but he already loved him. Whom
[59:34] having not seen ye love, in whom though
[59:37] now you see him not, yet believing ye
[59:39] rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of
[59:43] glory, receiving the end of your faith,
[59:46] even the salvation of your souls. Now
[59:48] listen, of which the salvation the
[59:50] prophets have inquired and searched
[59:53] diligently, who prophesied of the grace
[59:56] that should come unto you. So this is
[59:58] not church grace. This is prophetic
[1:00:00] grace, which prophesied of the grace
[1:00:03] that should come unto you, which is
[1:00:05] because a prophet said, "You're a
[1:00:06] prophetic class of people." searching
[1:00:08] what or what manner of time the spirit
[1:00:10] of Christ which was in them did signify
[1:00:14] when it testified beforehand the
[1:00:16] sufferings of Christ and the glory that
[1:00:18] should follow unto whom it was revealed
[1:00:20] that not unto themselves but unto us
[1:00:23] they did minister the things which are
[1:00:25] now reported unto you by them that have
[1:00:28] preached the gospel unto you with the
[1:00:30] Holy Ghost sent down from heaven with
[1:00:33] things the angels desire to look into
[1:00:36] wherefore gird up the loins of your
[1:00:38] mind. Be sober and hope to the end for
[1:00:41] the grace that is to be brought unto you
[1:00:43] at the revelation of Jesus Christ. Amen.
[1:00:47] We ask the Lord this morning to bless
[1:00:49] the reading of his word. As you can have
[1:00:50] your seats here today, I want to by the
[1:00:52] help of the Lord for just a few moments
[1:00:54] this morning, if I would take a title, I
[1:00:57] want to speak to you on this. It is time
[1:01:00] to check the spiritual forecast. It is
[1:01:03] time to check the spiritual forecast. I
[1:01:05] want to read a quote here. It's a little
[1:01:07] lengthy, but I just want you to hear it
[1:01:08] this morning. I I believe Brother
[1:01:10] Brandham says it beautiful here and I
[1:01:12] know my redeemer liveth. 1955. He says,
[1:01:14] "I think of Job, the one we're reading
[1:01:16] of a few moments ago. He looked forward
[1:01:19] to this morning when he was old. He was
[1:01:21] stricken in age. His flesh was simply
[1:01:24] falling from his body from sores. His
[1:01:26] heart was broken in grief. Every mortal
[1:01:29] part of his being was withering away.
[1:01:31] And a great man like that who made a
[1:01:33] great impression to the world of his
[1:01:35] day. All that he was, the greatness, he
[1:01:37] would go to the cities of the east and
[1:01:39] the princes would bow before him on
[1:01:41] account of wisdom. But here he was at
[1:01:44] wits end. Isn't that something? Here he
[1:01:46] was at his wit's end. Everything was
[1:01:48] gone. Seemingly his body was gone. His
[1:01:51] property was gone. His children was
[1:01:53] gone. All that he had was gone. But then
[1:01:55] God in his mercy come down to Job and
[1:01:59] give him another sense. Amen. God in his
[1:02:02] mercy came down to Job and give him
[1:02:05] another sense that he could open his
[1:02:07] eyes and see the day that when there
[1:02:10] would be a body he would receive. He
[1:02:13] knew there was one coming, a just one
[1:02:15] who would stand in his place, who would
[1:02:17] raise up the body of the dead. And he
[1:02:19] screamed out, "I know my redeemer
[1:02:21] liveth." I like those positive words.
[1:02:24] Amen. Not a hope. So I have a feeling
[1:02:26] there will be. He said that's the
[1:02:28] attitude of many today. I have a hope
[1:02:29] that someday. But Job had more than
[1:02:32] that. See? Amen. He said I know my
[1:02:35] redeemer liveth. That's a positive side.
[1:02:37] It's no more negative. It's all
[1:02:39] positive. And if today if we only have a
[1:02:42] cross on top of the church to show which
[1:02:45] is all right that we believe in Christ's
[1:02:46] death, burial, and resurrection. If we
[1:02:48] only have a few dead bodies of dust
[1:02:51] laying under the church that some of the
[1:02:53] saintly people were buried in. We only
[1:02:55] have that as a hope, then we're among
[1:02:57] all men most miserable. But today, how
[1:03:00] thankful that we are that we don't have
[1:03:02] the dead bodies, but we have the
[1:03:04] resurrected spirit of the Lord Jesus
[1:03:06] Christ, that he rose from the dead.
[1:03:09] Amen. Triumphant overall. It's not no
[1:03:12] more, I guess. So, you could look at a
[1:03:14] cross and guess so. You could look at a
[1:03:16] body laying on the ground and say, "I
[1:03:18] guess so and I hope so." But when the
[1:03:20] vision that struck Joel become a
[1:03:22] reality, then the resurrection of the
[1:03:25] Lord Jesus by the Holy Spirit in the
[1:03:27] heart, then you got it. He said, "I know
[1:03:29] my redeemer liveth." All the shadows had
[1:03:32] faded away. All the old darkness of hope
[1:03:34] so and maybe so. And we trust it'll be
[1:03:37] that way. It all faded away to everybody
[1:03:40] that ever made their heart a suppler,
[1:03:43] amen, of the Lord Jesus Christ. When
[1:03:45] Christ, the resurrected one, came to our
[1:03:47] sinful condition we were in. The old
[1:03:50] things died out in the crucifixion with
[1:03:52] him at the altar and we rose again a new
[1:03:54] with him and we live with him and we
[1:03:57] reign with him and we are seated now in
[1:04:00] heavenly places in Christ Jesus. Listen,
[1:04:03] we're already raised with him. The
[1:04:05] resurrection's already passed as far as
[1:04:08] we're concerned because we're now risen
[1:04:10] with Christ. Amen. Seated in heavenly
[1:04:13] places. There is no more guessing. There
[1:04:17] is no more wishing. It's over. We are
[1:04:20] now risen with him. Seated in heavenly
[1:04:22] places. You say, "Then brother Brandham,
[1:04:24] what does it mean that we should preach
[1:04:26] the gospel?" Amen. That's our next hope.
[1:04:29] Amen. Amen. The resurrection is our
[1:04:31] hope. But the next hope is the preaching
[1:04:34] of the gospel that produced the
[1:04:36] resurrection. After we have risen with
[1:04:38] him, then we have the great commission
[1:04:40] to go into all the world and bring these
[1:04:42] tidings to others. Listen folks, Job
[1:04:45] 4,000 years, amen, before the coming of
[1:04:49] the son of God. Amen. Job by a vision
[1:04:52] saw the resurrection and he received
[1:04:55] assurance. Amen. By the vision that he
[1:04:57] was going to be there. Amen. Job saw an
[1:05:00] Easter vision. Can I say it like this?
[1:05:03] Job received a forecast. He received a
[1:05:06] picture. He received a vision of the
[1:05:08] future. And you say this morning, what
[1:05:10] are you talking about? That's what these
[1:05:12] meetings have been. They have been a
[1:05:14] vision. Amen. Or a future of your life.
[1:05:18] But listen, it's not going to remain in
[1:05:20] vision form. It's not going to remain in
[1:05:23] future form. But there is the God of
[1:05:25] Abraham and Isaac and Jacob that is here
[1:05:28] this morning. Amen. To transport you by
[1:05:31] the preaching of the assurance of the
[1:05:33] vision into the fulfillment of it. When
[1:05:36] you look there at that word forecast, it
[1:05:38] is a prophecy. It is an estimate. It is
[1:05:40] a prediction. Amen. Of future happenings
[1:05:43] or the condition. Amen. I love that,
[1:05:45] brother Mark. It don't just predict the
[1:05:47] future, but it tells the conditions that
[1:05:50] will be there when that thing takes
[1:05:52] place. Amen. It is to predict or
[1:05:54] estimate a future event or trend. It is
[1:05:57] to indicate as likely to occur. It is to
[1:06:00] calculate the future. How many can thank
[1:06:03] God for the message of the hour? Amen.
[1:06:05] This morning, we don't just have the
[1:06:07] promise of the rapture, but we have an
[1:06:09] entire sermon called the rapture that
[1:06:11] tells us the background or the condition
[1:06:13] or the setting, amen, in which the
[1:06:16] rapture will take place. When I look
[1:06:18] there at that word forecast, another
[1:06:20] word for forecast is vision. Brother
[1:06:22] said, "What is a vision? It is a
[1:06:24] forecast of future events. It foretells
[1:06:27] the thing before it happens." Amen. See,
[1:06:30] when a prophet is born, Amen. He's not
[1:06:32] born and becomes a prophet. Amen. But
[1:06:34] before he was born, he was already given
[1:06:37] a gift to be a prophet. He said, "Then a
[1:06:40] vision is what? It's the word of God or
[1:06:43] something foretold or a forecast of an
[1:06:46] event." He said, "A vision that the
[1:06:48] prophets had and Jesus had and Paul had
[1:06:50] all of them." Amen. And they tell of
[1:06:53] this day. Amen. Was a forecast of what
[1:06:56] would happen. And here we see the
[1:06:58] forecast being made manifest. Amen. And
[1:07:01] people don't even recognize it. Listen.
[1:07:03] The church age book is more than just a
[1:07:05] book to argue about. Amen. It's a
[1:07:07] forecast. The prophet of God said the
[1:07:10] preaching of the seven church ages.
[1:07:11] Amen. Which is the pattern. Amen. Or the
[1:07:14] forecast of all. Amen. That God was
[1:07:17] going to do for the churches. Amen. and
[1:07:19] through the churches. Amen. And
[1:07:21] positioningly setting them up. Listen,
[1:07:24] in the Old Testament, when you read the
[1:07:26] Bible, in the Old Testament, over 2,000
[1:07:28] times, you will read the words, "Thus
[1:07:31] saith the Lord." He said, "Now, if a man
[1:07:34] says, "Thus sayaith the Lord," Amen.
[1:07:36] It's not the man talking. He wouldn't be
[1:07:38] a prophet. Amen. He said, "If he would,
[1:07:40] he wouldn't be a prophet. He would be a
[1:07:41] hypocrite." Amen. Cuz it would never
[1:07:44] come to pass. Amen. There's one chance
[1:07:46] out of 10,000 that he might guess at it.
[1:07:48] Amen. But if it's thus sayaith the Lord,
[1:07:51] Amen. the Lord God has said it. Amen. So
[1:07:54] the Bible is thus sayaith the Lord.
[1:07:57] Amen. By the prophets. This Bible didn't
[1:08:00] come from reformers. This Bible didn't
[1:08:02] come from theologians. This Bible didn't
[1:08:04] come from critics. This Bible came from
[1:08:06] the Lord. Amen. That spake, amen,
[1:08:09] through the channel of prophets.
[1:08:11] Everyone said that's why they took
[1:08:12] Christ's spirit upon themselves and they
[1:08:15] forecast the events, amen, that would
[1:08:17] come to pass. Amen. Talk about forecast.
[1:08:20] Amen. When the readers would read it,
[1:08:22] they actually thought, amen, that they
[1:08:24] were talking about themselves. When they
[1:08:26] read Job's writings, Brother Wendle,
[1:08:28] they thought Job was talking about
[1:08:30] himself. When they read Zechariah and
[1:08:32] Ezekiel and Daniel and all the prophets,
[1:08:35] when they read those writings, they
[1:08:36] thought they're talking about
[1:08:37] themselves, but in reality, they were
[1:08:40] talking about you. Come on, church.
[1:08:42] People's been reading Paul's writings
[1:08:43] for years. They've been reading that we
[1:08:45] shall not all die, but we shall be alive
[1:08:47] and remain. Do you realize this morning
[1:08:50] there's not one Thessalonian alive?
[1:08:52] There's not one Corinthian alive. Amen.
[1:08:54] But here you are this morning, and you
[1:08:56] are alive by the baptism of the Holy
[1:08:59] Ghost. Listen, what Paul wrote about,
[1:09:02] what Peter prophesied, what Jesus said
[1:09:04] would come to pass, you are living in
[1:09:06] the hour of the fulfillment of the
[1:09:09] vision of almighty God. Yes, sir. He was
[1:09:12] actually speaking about you, brother.
[1:09:14] Said like this, they were moved, amen,
[1:09:16] by the Holy Ghost. That's why Peter said
[1:09:19] the prophecy, it came not in old time by
[1:09:21] the will of man, but holy men of God
[1:09:24] spake. Amen. They spake as they were
[1:09:26] moved. Amen. by the Holy Ghost. I love
[1:09:30] what the prophet says in prophecy. If
[1:09:32] it's the true word of God, then it
[1:09:34] cannot fail. If it's a true prophecy
[1:09:37] from the word of God, it can not fail.
[1:09:41] Listen, when you think of this word
[1:09:42] forecast, Amen. What you automatically
[1:09:45] think about, Amen, is the weather
[1:09:46] forecast, right? Amen. Now, do you
[1:09:48] realize there's a natural forecast,
[1:09:51] amen, but there's also a spiritual
[1:09:53] forecast. When we think of that word
[1:09:55] forecast, as I said, Amen. we think of a
[1:09:57] weather forecast which in the in the
[1:09:59] book of Matthew the 16th chapter in the
[1:10:01] book of Luke the 12th chapter the Bible
[1:10:03] itself actually speaks amen of a weather
[1:10:06] forecast but when it speaks of that
[1:10:08] brother Kenny amen it's saying they have
[1:10:11] the ability amen to discern the face of
[1:10:13] the skies but they don't have the
[1:10:15] ability to discern amen the signs of the
[1:10:18] time when you look at that what he's
[1:10:20] saying is amen they're lacking spiritual
[1:10:23] discernment I'll say this as the elected
[1:10:26] overcomers of this age. Amen. We can do
[1:10:29] without a bunch of things, right? Amen.
[1:10:30] We don't have to have a bunch of fancy
[1:10:32] things and a bunch of polished things.
[1:10:34] But there's one thing that a believer,
[1:10:36] amen, must have in this age if he's
[1:10:38] going to overcome this age, and that is
[1:10:41] spiritual
[1:10:42] discernment. Amen. Spiritual
[1:10:44] discernment. Paul said that the natural
[1:10:47] man receiveth not the things of the
[1:10:48] spirit of God, for they are foolishness
[1:10:50] unto him, neither can he know them.
[1:10:53] Amen. because they are spiritually
[1:10:55] discerned. When you look there at that
[1:10:57] word spiritually discerned, it is by the
[1:10:59] aid of the Holy Ghost. Brother Ram comes
[1:11:02] along and says, "I think it's good for
[1:11:04] us as ministers, amen, to follow our
[1:11:06] order." See, amen. We have an order from
[1:11:09] God and that is for the discerning of
[1:11:11] spirits. Listen, we don't follow every
[1:11:13] spirit, church. We don't believe every
[1:11:16] spirit, but the Bible said, "Try the
[1:11:18] spirit." Amen. Because there's many
[1:11:20] false prophets that are gone out into
[1:11:22] the world. Listen, there's many false
[1:11:24] prophets forecasting things today that
[1:11:27] don't have a bit more truth to them than
[1:11:29] the man in the moon. Hey, but we don't
[1:11:31] have to follow that confusion. We don't
[1:11:33] have to follow that nonsense. We have
[1:11:35] received a vindicated forecast. And the
[1:11:38] Bible said, "Amen, we will we will know
[1:11:41] our God and we will be strong and we
[1:11:43] will do great exploits." Amen. The Bible
[1:11:46] had a forecast. It said in the last days
[1:11:48] they're going to have a form of
[1:11:49] godliness, but they're going to deny the
[1:11:52] power thereof. Brother M said that's a
[1:11:54] promise. He said there will be millions
[1:11:56] of church members fall away. There will
[1:11:58] be despisers of those that are good.
[1:12:00] Brother said, "What is that not the
[1:12:02] right discernment?" Brother David,
[1:12:04] they'll not have the right discernment.
[1:12:06] He said, "Well, you think that's
[1:12:07] communists?" No. He said, "That's
[1:12:09] so-called Christians." Amen. Having a
[1:12:11] form of godliness. Amen. But denying the
[1:12:14] power thereof. Amen. No spiritual
[1:12:17] discernment. When you got spiritual
[1:12:19] discernment and the Holy Ghost is upon
[1:12:21] you, you have spiritual discernment. And
[1:12:24] it says amen to every promise of God.
[1:12:28] Amen. Said Paul said, "Look at the days
[1:12:30] with thee." He said, "We've got it. It's
[1:12:32] here. It's on us. We look and we see it.
[1:12:35] We hear it from everywhere. And what do
[1:12:37] we do? It ought to draw us together."
[1:12:40] Amen. I say this. It's time, church.
[1:12:42] Amen. To forget man-made theology. It's
[1:12:45] time to forget who's doing what and
[1:12:47] who's going where and who's preaching
[1:12:49] what. It's time to cry out to God. Amen.
[1:12:52] For spiritual power and spiritual
[1:12:54] discernment. Listen. Amen. We're not
[1:12:56] going to follow YouTube out of here.
[1:12:58] We're not going to follow some fancy
[1:13:00] church out of here. We're not going to
[1:13:02] follow some program out of here. But we
[1:13:04] have been given a message and it's going
[1:13:06] to lead us out of this dimension into
[1:13:08] another one. Amen. It's more than just a
[1:13:10] sermon. It's more than just a book. It's
[1:13:12] a vision, church. It's a forecast. It's
[1:13:15] Luke 17:30. In the day when the son of
[1:13:19] man will be revealed. Look here. The
[1:13:21] Bible said that Jesus prophesied and
[1:13:23] then the day the son of man will be
[1:13:24] revealed. And then the conditions of
[1:13:27] Sodom and Gomorrah would return. But Rem
[1:13:30] said, "Look, the police and homicides
[1:13:32] just go on all the time breaking up boys
[1:13:34] living together as husband and wife,
[1:13:36] women living the same way." Amen.
[1:13:38] Perverted. See, their minds are filthy
[1:13:40] minds because they don't have spiritual
[1:13:43] discernment. It's just a lust and a
[1:13:46] filth, and they can't satisfy themselves
[1:13:48] even with one another. They don't even
[1:13:50] marry no more. They just take up and go
[1:13:52] one until they're perverted. But Jesus
[1:13:54] said that it would be in the last days.
[1:13:57] But it took a prophet to say, "Here it
[1:14:00] is." Amen. It took a prophet to stand on
[1:14:03] a platform and say, "Here it is." Amen.
[1:14:06] The days of Sodom and Gomorrah are not
[1:14:09] on their way. The days of Sodom and
[1:14:11] Gomar are here. Now, I can prove it to
[1:14:14] you by the message. Y'all remember a few
[1:14:16] years ago, Amen. They they went and
[1:14:18] legalized samesex marriage. I know it's
[1:14:20] a tent meeting, but I'm going to preach
[1:14:22] a minute. They legalized same-sex
[1:14:24] marriage. And a few days after that,
[1:14:26] they went down to the courthouse, two
[1:14:27] homosexuals, and they walked in there
[1:14:29] and they wanted a license. Well, there
[1:14:31] was little woman down there named Kim
[1:14:32] Davis. Some of you probably heard of
[1:14:34] her. I say, "God bless that woman. I
[1:14:36] don't care about her background. I thank
[1:14:37] God for what she stood for." She said,
[1:14:39] "I will not give you a license." Amen.
[1:14:41] To marry in this county. They called the
[1:14:44] police, put her in jail. Brother Joe,
[1:14:46] the day they put her in jail, I was
[1:14:47] listening to a tape and brother said
[1:14:49] this. He said, "Someday there will come
[1:14:51] a solemn law and they will be protected
[1:14:54] by that solemn law." I thought, "Here I
[1:14:56] am living in the fulfillment of what a
[1:14:59] prophet said. 50 years ago, they would
[1:15:01] have run the boys out of the county and
[1:15:03] put them in the jail. But 50 years
[1:15:05] later, amen, they put the woman in the
[1:15:07] jail for standing for the principles of
[1:15:09] God. Well, if you think it's going to
[1:15:11] get better, it's only going to get
[1:15:13] worse. But I heard another scripture in
[1:15:15] these times begin to come to pass. Lift
[1:15:18] up your head. Your redemption is drawing
[1:15:21] nigh. When you see Sodom and Gomorrah,
[1:15:23] when you see homosexuality, when you see
[1:15:25] perversion, when you see lawlessness,
[1:15:28] when you see crime filling our streets
[1:15:30] and fill in our lives, it's time to go
[1:15:32] home. We have received another forecast.
[1:15:35] It's called the message of the
[1:15:38] hour. And this spiritual discernment is
[1:15:40] not guessing something is right. It's
[1:15:43] knowing something is right. Jesus said,
[1:15:45] "You shall know the truth, and the truth
[1:15:47] shall make you free." Rebra come along
[1:15:49] said a man could read a newspaper if
[1:15:51] he's got any spiritual discernment about
[1:15:53] him at all and he can see that we are at
[1:15:56] the end.
[1:15:58] The hour is here. There is nothing left
[1:16:01] for us but the coming of the Lord. Some
[1:16:04] people go out and say, "Oh, that might
[1:16:06] be a thousand years from today." I don't
[1:16:08] believe that. He says, "I believe this
[1:16:11] generation will see the coming of the
[1:16:14] Lord Jesus. And if this generation
[1:16:16] doesn't do it, and I love this quote, I
[1:16:19] want to preach to the young people. One
[1:16:21] of the greatest honors of my life has
[1:16:24] not been making a football goal, not
[1:16:26] been making a basketball goal. One of
[1:16:28] the greatest honors of my life is having
[1:16:30] the privilege, amen, to stand on
[1:16:32] platforms around this world and say what
[1:16:34] a prophet said to our young people.
[1:16:36] Amen. Because I know, amen, somebody's
[1:16:39] going to see this rapture. Somebody's
[1:16:41] going to taste the power of translation.
[1:16:44] Somebody's going to experience what it's
[1:16:46] like to walk with God like Enoch. And
[1:16:49] one minute he'll be and the next minute
[1:16:51] he'll not. I want to preach to the young
[1:16:54] people. See, what he's saying is, I want
[1:16:56] to build up a spiritual expectation.
[1:16:59] When the world has taken every reason
[1:17:01] away from them to expect anything but
[1:17:04] gloom and doom and tribulation and
[1:17:07] destruction, I want to preach a message
[1:17:10] that'll cause them to shout, "Amen."
[1:17:12] I want to preach a message that'll cause
[1:17:14] them to go across the country to youth
[1:17:17] camps. I want to tell them something
[1:17:19] that'll cause them, amen, to turn from
[1:17:21] the things of Leodysia and to embrace
[1:17:23] the things of God. I want to tell them
[1:17:25] they got a future home. I want to tell
[1:17:27] them they got a body. I want to tell
[1:17:29] them they got a theophony. I want to
[1:17:31] tell them there is streets of gold and
[1:17:33] there's a crystal river and there's a
[1:17:34] tree of life. I want to tell them that
[1:17:37] one of these mornings between 6:00 and
[1:17:39] 9, there's going to be a cold sweep
[1:17:41] that's going to come across their bodies
[1:17:43] and in the moment, in the twinkling of
[1:17:44] an eye, they're going to be changed. I
[1:17:46] want to tell them a good
[1:17:49] report. Hallelujah. I don't want their
[1:17:51] expectations to die and become stale.
[1:17:55] Come on. I don't want their
[1:17:56] anticipations to become stagnated.
[1:17:59] Listen, Re said, until he comes, we want
[1:18:01] to live each day that he might come the
[1:18:03] next minute.
[1:18:05] because it might be the end of your
[1:18:06] life. Listen, it might be the end of
[1:18:09] your life at that
[1:18:12] minute. Are you hearing me? Remember
[1:18:15] said, you don't know when you're going.
[1:18:16] This may be your last breath. We have it
[1:18:19] in us now. So, what do you want to use
[1:18:21] it for? Oh, God. I could preach right
[1:18:24] there for about 20 minutes. Amen. This
[1:18:26] could be your last breath in church.
[1:18:30] What do you want to use it for? Has that
[1:18:32] ever crossed your mind? When you're
[1:18:33] sitting there on Wednesday night, it's
[1:18:35] the evangelist coming out. When you're
[1:18:36] sitting there on Wednesday night all wed
[1:18:38] up cuz this happened and that happened
[1:18:40] and instead of praising God with your
[1:18:41] breath, you're criticizing the preacher,
[1:18:44] criticizing the singer, criticizing the
[1:18:46] young people. I tell you what you ought
[1:18:47] to do. You ought to take your breath and
[1:18:50] say, "I refuse." Amen. To give it to the
[1:18:52] devil. I'm going to use my breath
[1:18:54] because my Bible said, "Let everything
[1:18:57] that hath breath, let it praise ye the
[1:19:00] Lord." If I'm going to use my breath,
[1:19:02] let me use it to put it behind this
[1:19:04] message and say, "The world is falling
[1:19:07] apart." But little bride, lift up your
[1:19:09] head. You got a
[1:19:11] future. God promised a prophet in the
[1:19:14] last days. Listen, we're not looking for
[1:19:16] a prophet. We have a prophet. He said,
[1:19:18] "I will send you a prophet, and he will
[1:19:20] bring thee into the place which I have
[1:19:22] prepared." I love what Malachi said. He
[1:19:24] said, "Behold, I will send unto you
[1:19:27] Elijah the prophet before the coming of
[1:19:29] the great and the dreadful day of the
[1:19:31] Lord." Now listen, watch the forecast.
[1:19:33] "And he shall turn the heart."
[1:19:36] He shall turn the heart of the fathers
[1:19:39] to the children, and the heart of the
[1:19:41] children to their fathers, lest I come
[1:19:43] and smite the earth with a curse." Now,
[1:19:46] let me say this. We're a Joshua
[1:19:48] generation. We come out under a Moses,
[1:19:51] right? We go into the land under a
[1:19:53] Joshua. Do you realize our Moses and
[1:19:56] Joshua was in the same ministry of the
[1:19:58] seventh angel? He said, "I am a Moses
[1:20:01] calling you out of Egypt, calling you
[1:20:03] out of Leosa, but I'm going to take you
[1:20:06] somewhere. I'm going to positionally
[1:20:08] place you in the land of your
[1:20:10] inheritance." Look here, what Joshua,
[1:20:13] the new leader, did was he positionally,
[1:20:16] Amen, set them up in the tribes of
[1:20:18] Israel, and he divided the land of
[1:20:20] inheritance. But you know how he done
[1:20:22] it? He didn't do it by his ability to
[1:20:24] preach. He didn't do it by his
[1:20:26] education. He did it by spiritual
[1:20:28] discernment. And Reverend said this. He
[1:20:31] said there they remained in their place
[1:20:33] and they became the cream of the crop.
[1:20:37] I'll say this. Spiritual discernment,
[1:20:39] amen, is spiritual revelation of God.
[1:20:42] Watch what Jesus said. He said, "Flesh
[1:20:44] and blood has not revealed this to you."
[1:20:46] Amen. But my father which is in heaven.
[1:20:49] Re said, "You never learned it through
[1:20:50] education or denominational lines." He
[1:20:53] said, "Now watch and see where the gates
[1:20:56] of hell is against. It ain't against the
[1:20:58] denomination. It ain't against the
[1:21:00] government. The world recognizes them.
[1:21:03] Where is it against? It's against the
[1:21:05] spiritual revelation of Christ being
[1:21:09] here now, the same yesterday, today, and
[1:21:12] forever." He said, "Watch. That's where
[1:21:14] the church is missing it today." Amen.
[1:21:16] is that spiritual discernment to see
[1:21:20] what God is doing. Amen. They look way
[1:21:22] over the top for something here that's
[1:21:24] going on right here and it'll be past
[1:21:27] you. Amen. Before you know it. Can I say
[1:21:29] it to you? Don't miss it.
[1:21:32] [Applause]
[1:21:33] Can I say it to you? Don't miss it.
[1:21:36] Don't miss it, folks. These moments are
[1:21:38] the precious moments of your life. These
[1:21:40] are some of the most valuable times.
[1:21:43] Don't miss it.
[1:21:45] Well, the devil don't like that. But I'm
[1:21:47] going to say it again. Don't miss
[1:21:48] Wednesday night services.
[1:21:51] [Applause]
[1:21:53] Don't miss them prayer
[1:21:55] meetings. Don't miss them revivals at
[1:21:57] your church. Don't miss the power of God
[1:22:00] moving in the lives of your church.
[1:22:02] Don't miss it. It's a valuable time.
[1:22:04] Listen, they're always looking for what
[1:22:06] God's going to do, looking back to what
[1:22:08] God did, and they're missing what God is
[1:22:11] doing right now. Can I say this this
[1:22:13] morning? We're not looking for a vision.
[1:22:15] We're looking at a vision. We have a
[1:22:19] vision. Proverbs said, "Where there is
[1:22:21] no vision, the people will perish." I
[1:22:23] love that word vision. One of my
[1:22:24] favorite words in the entire Bible.
[1:22:26] Amen. That means oracle or prophecy,
[1:22:29] which is divine communication. Brother
[1:22:32] says, "What is a vision? It's another
[1:22:34] dimension." See, he said it's outside of
[1:22:37] the five. It's a six sense. What is a
[1:22:40] vision? Someone has asked me many times,
[1:22:42] "Brother Brandon, are you impressed to
[1:22:44] say certain things? Do you just think it
[1:22:46] in your mind?" No, sir. I see it.
[1:22:50] Exactly like I'm looking at you like
[1:22:52] you're standing here yet maybe 40 years
[1:22:55] back in somebody's life. Amen. He says
[1:22:57] this. Amen. A vision is God. So a vision
[1:23:01] is God by a word of knowledge dropping
[1:23:03] to the person to foresee or foresee
[1:23:06] something. It tells something that has
[1:23:09] been or something that will be. A vision
[1:23:13] tells what has been or it tells
[1:23:16] something that will be. I love what the
[1:23:18] prophet said in Job's darkest hour when
[1:23:21] he's sitting on the ash heap. Amen. God
[1:23:24] in his mercy came down to Job and you
[1:23:27] know what he done? He gave him another
[1:23:30] sense.
[1:23:32] I'm feeling good. He gave him another
[1:23:35] sense. In the darkest hour of Job's
[1:23:38] life, he comes down to him sitting on an
[1:23:41] ash heap with soores on his body with
[1:23:44] his flesh fallen off. He's at his wits
[1:23:47] end. Everything is gone. Everything is
[1:23:50] lost. But in the darkest of hours,
[1:23:52] hallelujah. In the darkest of hours,
[1:23:54] mercy come walking to Job and give him
[1:23:57] another sense. You know what the Bible
[1:23:59] says? The Bible says faith is the
[1:24:02] substance of things hoped for. It's the
[1:24:04] evidence of things not seen. You know
[1:24:06] what Paul said in Galatians 2 verse 19?
[1:24:09] He said, "I through the law am dead to
[1:24:11] the law that I might live unto God. I am
[1:24:14] crucified with Christ. Nevertheless, I
[1:24:17] live yet not I but Christ liveth in me.
[1:24:21] And the life which I now live, I live in
[1:24:24] the flesh." Glory to God. The life I now
[1:24:28] live, I live in the flesh by the faith
[1:24:31] of the son of God who loved me and gave
[1:24:34] himself for me. Well, Job, I got a
[1:24:37] message for you this morning. You might
[1:24:39] have come to these meetings in one
[1:24:41] sense, but you're leaving in another.
[1:24:43] You might have come to these services
[1:24:45] under the dictation of one sense, but
[1:24:47] bless God, you're going to leave here
[1:24:49] under the leadership of another sense.
[1:24:51] You say, "What are you talking about?"
[1:24:53] How many's ever heard the phrase in one
[1:24:56] sense but in
[1:24:57] another? You ever heard that? You know
[1:24:59] what it means? It means to refer to the
[1:25:02] different ways we perceive the world.
[1:25:05] Different ways we perceive the world.
[1:25:08] Brother Tim through our five senses.
[1:25:10] Look here. Amen. The best example I know
[1:25:12] of brother gives us in the bio from the
[1:25:14] message. He said there was a man came
[1:25:16] and handed a woman a box of
[1:25:17] rattlesnakes. He said listen. He said
[1:25:20] these are yours. Got your name on it. I
[1:25:21] love what brother says, brother Joel. He
[1:25:23] said, "In one sense, they
[1:25:26] were, but in another sense they were
[1:25:28] not." In one sense, they belong to her,
[1:25:32] but in another sense they didn't belong
[1:25:34] to her. You say, "How can you say that?"
[1:25:36] He said, "Because it had her name on
[1:25:38] it." Can I say this? But it didn't
[1:25:40] become hers until she claimed it. Amen.
[1:25:43] Even though it had her name on it, it
[1:25:45] did not become hers until she claimed
[1:25:48] it. Can I say this to you? I am in Leosa
[1:25:51] but I am not of Leosa. In one sense I'm
[1:25:55] in the world but in another sense I'm
[1:25:58] not of this world. In one
[1:26:00] sense in one sense I'm the son of my
[1:26:03] earthly father and my earthly mother but
[1:26:05] in another sense I got a gene seed of
[1:26:08] God on the inside of my soul. Listen, it
[1:26:11] didn't come from the devil so the devil
[1:26:12] can't take it away. It didn't come from
[1:26:14] my family so my family can't take it
[1:26:16] away. It didn't come from a church so my
[1:26:19] church can't take it away. It came from
[1:26:22] the mind of God through the voice of the
[1:26:24] seventh angel and it claimed
[1:26:27] me. Brother said he was a man speaking
[1:26:30] of Jesus in one sense but he was God in
[1:26:33] another sense. He was a man in one sense
[1:26:36] but in the spirit he was God. I love
[1:26:38] this. He said we are carnal and that
[1:26:40] part must perish but then the inside we
[1:26:43] are a spirit man. We have a soul on the
[1:26:46] inside and that's faith in God's word.
[1:26:49] Then we bring our outside body under
[1:26:52] subjection to the word by faith by
[1:26:55] accepting what God has said. Look at
[1:26:59] this word sense. It means the ability to
[1:27:01] understand, to recognize, to value, to
[1:27:04] react to something. Can I say something
[1:27:06] to you? We have five outer senses,
[1:27:08] right? See, taste, feel, smell, hear.
[1:27:13] We have five inner senses. Imagine,
[1:27:15] conscience, memory, reason, and
[1:27:17] affection. Right? But the prophet of God
[1:27:19] said, "Amen." But then we have another
[1:27:21] sense. Brother Daryl, he said, "It's a
[1:27:23] six sense." He said, "It's a direct
[1:27:25] sense, and it's the only positive
[1:27:27] sense." Come on, folks. When God came
[1:27:30] down in mercy to Job on the ash heap and
[1:27:33] he gave him another sense, watch what
[1:27:36] changed. His language changed from
[1:27:38] negative to positive because the faith
[1:27:40] of the God of the resurrected Lord I'm
[1:27:43] trying to behave myself is the six sense
[1:27:46] and it's the only thing that is
[1:27:48] positive. Come on church. Your seeing is
[1:27:51] not positive. Your feeling is not
[1:27:53] positive. Your memory is not positive.
[1:27:55] Your imagination is not positive. But
[1:27:58] God who is rich in mercy has compound in
[1:28:01] this age and he give you another sense
[1:28:03] and it's superior to every inner sense.
[1:28:06] It's superior to every outer sense. What
[1:28:09] sense is it, church? I'm talking about
[1:28:11] the faith of God has returned to the
[1:28:14] church in the last
[1:28:16] days. If you're possessed with faith,
[1:28:19] then it's just as real and as much
[1:28:21] reality to you as God is. In a man, he
[1:28:23] is one sense a miniature creator if he's
[1:28:25] a child of God. But the spirit of God is
[1:28:28] in him who controls him and who operates
[1:28:31] him. Amen. I didn't get time to put in
[1:28:33] my notes, but I'll give it to you right
[1:28:35] now. Y'all remember the Bible said, I
[1:28:37] think it's uh Amen. Can you give me uh 1
[1:28:39] Corinthians 4:8 or 2 Corinthians 4:8?
[1:28:41] Amen. The Bible, it talks about being
[1:28:43] perplexed. What is it? Y'all
[1:28:46] remember it's the end of
[1:28:48] meat. Y'all remember that scripture? 1
[1:28:51] Corinthians 4, something like that.
[1:28:52] Anyhow, they'll put it up there.
[1:28:54] Perplexed.
[1:28:56] There it is. We are troubled on every
[1:28:58] Thank you. We are troubled on every They
[1:29:00] do a lot of work. Give them folks a big
[1:29:02] hand. God bless you all.
[1:29:07] We are tr and sometimes we don't even
[1:29:10] know they're back there till the
[1:29:10] microphone cracks. God bless you all. We
[1:29:13] are troubled on every side yet not
[1:29:16] distressed. In one sense, brother
[1:29:18] Windle, we're troubled on every side,
[1:29:19] but in another sense we're not
[1:29:21] distressed. We are perplexed in one
[1:29:23] sense, but brother Caleb, in another
[1:29:25] sense, we're not in despair. Give me the
[1:29:27] next verse. Amen. There it is. Amen.
[1:29:30] Amen. We are persecuted in one sense,
[1:29:32] but in another sense, we're not
[1:29:34] forsaken. We are cast down in one sense,
[1:29:37] but in another sense, we're not
[1:29:39] destroyed. Are y'all hearing me? I'm
[1:29:42] talking about the people who have
[1:29:43] received a vision in the darkest hour of
[1:29:46] seven church ages, and another sense has
[1:29:49] returned to the church, and it has
[1:29:51] positionally placed you as an overcomer
[1:29:54] in
[1:29:55] Leosa. Well, somebody shot that devil
[1:29:58] out of this building. I got another
[1:30:00] sense and the world didn't give it and
[1:30:02] the world can't take it
[1:30:05] away. Yes, sir. That six sense has come
[1:30:09] and it only belongs to Christians. It
[1:30:12] only belongs to Christians. It only
[1:30:15] belongs to believers.
[1:30:21] Whip that devil back to Georgia.
[1:30:24] Brother Matt, whip that devil back to
[1:30:26] Arkansas. Brother Daryl, whip him back
[1:30:28] down to Tennessee. Brother Wendle, whip
[1:30:31] him back to Oklahoma. Brother Diego,
[1:30:33] whip him back to to Kentucky or Indiana,
[1:30:36] wherever. Amen. Amen. Brother Joe, whip
[1:30:38] him back to Tennessee. Brother Sean,
[1:30:41] whip him back to Riner. Brother Tim,
[1:30:43] whip him back to North Carolina. Ronnie,
[1:30:45] whip him back to Ohio. I may be defeated
[1:30:48] in one sense. I may look distressed in
[1:30:51] one sense, but in another sense, I am a
[1:30:54] son of God. in another sense. I have
[1:30:56] come from God and I'm going back to God
[1:30:59] and there ain't nothing the devil can do
[1:31:01] in time to reverse what God has
[1:31:05] done in
[1:31:08] eternity. I'm talking about we've
[1:31:11] received another
[1:31:14] sense, brother Sean. We got another
[1:31:17] sense. It's not sin. It's not taste.
[1:31:21] Brother Jonathan, it's not imagination.
[1:31:23] It's faith.
[1:31:25] I got so many quotes here I got to skip
[1:31:26] over them. But I'll say this. The super
[1:31:28] sense is the Holy Spirit. And it's the
[1:31:32] faith of God that dwells in you. It
[1:31:38] don't visit you. It dwells in you. Bram
[1:31:42] said that six sense, it controls the
[1:31:44] five senses. He said what it'll do is it
[1:31:47] will deliver that word to you and then
[1:31:50] make you walk contrary to any other
[1:31:52] thing there is. But God's word, you say,
[1:31:55] "Brother Andrew, nobody preaches a new
[1:31:57] birth." Well, I don't know what grock
[1:31:58] you're under. But brother said this. He
[1:32:01] said, "The new birth activates or it
[1:32:03] quickens that super sense." He said,
[1:32:05] "The six sense come for this reason
[1:32:07] only. That was to make the five senses
[1:32:09] in you deny anything that is contrary to
[1:32:13] God's word. That is what the six sense
[1:32:16] is for." The scripture speaks of casting
[1:32:18] down reasonings. He said, "You walk by
[1:32:21] the six sense. You talk by the six
[1:32:23] sense. You you live by the six sense.
[1:32:25] You die by the six sense. You rise by
[1:32:28] the six sense. You super sense something
[1:32:30] that's in you, but it's different from
[1:32:33] what the natural man is. See, so the
[1:32:35] natural man's senses are all right. But
[1:32:38] they've got to be brought into
[1:32:39] submission to the six sense. I'm going
[1:32:41] somewhere. If the natural mind says and
[1:32:44] reads the word of God and says that is
[1:32:46] the word of God, it's speaking the
[1:32:48] truth. But if it reads it and says it's
[1:32:50] not all the word of God or it was or
[1:32:53] it's something it was one time but it
[1:32:56] isn't now. He said then the six comes
[1:32:59] in. Then the six sense comes in and says
[1:33:02] he's the same yesterday, today and
[1:33:06] forever. He says see the six senses come
[1:33:08] upon the human being to make them deny
[1:33:11] anything that is contrary to the word of
[1:33:14] God. Well glory to God. The sixth sense
[1:33:18] has come upon the human being to cause
[1:33:21] them to deny anything that is contrary
[1:33:24] to the word of God. Amen. Why are we
[1:33:26] having amen so many issues and problems
[1:33:29] is because we're not laying down and
[1:33:32] accepting the box of rattlesnakes. We're
[1:33:34] not laying down and accepting, well,
[1:33:36] this is the way it'll be and and this is
[1:33:38] my future and this is my life. No, we
[1:33:40] have received another sense and it rises
[1:33:43] up on the inside of us and the devil
[1:33:45] says you're not going to make it. But
[1:33:47] the six sense raises up and says you've
[1:33:49] already made it. The devil says you're
[1:33:51] sick but the six sense raises up and
[1:33:54] says but by my stripes you are healed.
[1:33:57] The devil says you're not going to get
[1:33:58] out of these. Amen. But the six sense
[1:34:01] raises up and says I've already heard
[1:34:03] the eagle scream. I've already left that
[1:34:06] old church age. I've come over into the
[1:34:08] presence of the soom. What is it? Amen.
[1:34:11] The sixth sense feeds only on the word
[1:34:13] of
[1:34:15] God. It's a greater sense. I'm laying
[1:34:18] these in here for a purpose. It's a
[1:34:20] faith. It's a power that stirs and
[1:34:23] drives. What is it? Now, now, can I say
[1:34:25] this to you? Y'all ever been in a
[1:34:27] service and you really didn't feel like
[1:34:28] saying amen?
[1:34:30] Four of you.
[1:34:33] Y'all ever been in a service and you
[1:34:34] didn't feel like saying amen?
[1:34:38] You weren't backslid.
[1:34:41] You were just troubled on every side.
[1:34:48] Wasn't on your way to hell. You were
[1:34:50] just persecuted but not cast down.
[1:34:54] You were not defeated. You were just
[1:34:55] afflicted.
[1:34:58] Hallelujah. But then the word of God
[1:35:00] began to come forth and something rose
[1:35:02] up in you and said, "Amen."
[1:35:05] Amen. That's the truth. Preach it,
[1:35:08] preacher. Hallelujah. It's the truth.
[1:35:10] You know what that was? The prophet of
[1:35:12] God said the six sense was catching it.
[1:35:15] The six sense was catching it. He said,
[1:35:17] "And the Holy Spirit," Thank you, buddy,
[1:35:18] was standing side by side and the Holy
[1:35:21] Spirit was speaking and the six sense
[1:35:24] was saying,
[1:35:25] "Amen." Woo! Glory. So, it wasn't even
[1:35:29] you doing it in the first place. It was
[1:35:31] the sixth sense on the inside of you
[1:35:34] that was hearing the word of God. He
[1:35:36] said, "See, the spirit was speaking and
[1:35:38] the six sense was saying, "Amen. There
[1:35:40] it is." He said, "Something has to
[1:35:43] happen." Well, somebody ring the bells
[1:35:46] in the house of God on Sunday morning.
[1:35:48] This is not a see, taste, feel, smell,
[1:35:50] hearing. This is not a memory, reason,
[1:35:53] affection, conscience, imagination
[1:35:55] meeting. This is another sense meeting
[1:35:57] where the faith of God has returned into
[1:36:00] the church of the living God. We're not
[1:36:02] dictated by what we see. We don't praise
[1:36:05] because of the way we feel. We don't
[1:36:07] sing because of what we remember. We do
[1:36:09] it because there's something on the
[1:36:11] inside of us that's got to let
[1:36:14] loose. Come on, church. It was not
[1:36:17] rapturing feelings. It was not rapturing
[1:36:19] signs. It was not rapturing imagination.
[1:36:22] It was rapturing faith.
[1:36:24] Because this rapture will only be taken
[1:36:27] by something greater than you was born
[1:36:29] in.
[1:36:32] Remember, something has to happen.
[1:36:38] Well, I don't feel like going to the
[1:36:39] rapture. Six says too bad.
[1:36:45] Well, I can't see myself in the rapture.
[1:36:48] Six says too bad. The word already put
[1:36:50] you there. Woo.
[1:36:55] outer senses said it's hopeless. We're
[1:36:58] got no future. But the six sense comes
[1:37:01] down and says, "But I
[1:37:03] know I know, brother. I know my redeemer
[1:37:07] liveth. I know at the last days he will
[1:37:10] stand upon the
[1:37:11] earth. I know there's 4,000 years
[1:37:14] between me and that fulfillment. But I
[1:37:16] have a revelation and it's pulsating in
[1:37:19] my soul that God is more than able these
[1:37:21] stones to rise children unto Abraham.
[1:37:25] Yes sir. Remember what a vision is. It's
[1:37:27] a six sense. Look what Peter says. He
[1:37:29] says, "If any man speak, let him speak
[1:37:31] as the oracles of God. If any man
[1:37:34] minister, let him do it as of the
[1:37:36] ability which God giveth that God in all
[1:37:39] things." things. Somebody say all things
[1:37:40] may be glorified through Jesus Christ to
[1:37:43] whom be praise and dominion forever. See
[1:37:47] what's happening is we are partaking of
[1:37:50] the holy oracles of
[1:37:52] God. But Ram said this. He said Joshua
[1:37:55] took the oracles of God and he marched
[1:37:59] over into the promised land. He said now
[1:38:02] I want you to get built up now in this
[1:38:04] holy oracles of God in the faith of this
[1:38:06] hour. the faith. It's going to take more
[1:38:09] faith than ever was any age for this has
[1:38:13] to be rapturing faith to be taken up.
[1:38:17] Can I say this? Our vision is the
[1:38:19] oracles of God. It's the spiritual
[1:38:22] forecast. Can I say this very plainly?
[1:38:25] It's the message of the
[1:38:31] hour. It's the message of
[1:38:38] I got a really simple brother Daryl's
[1:38:40] known me since I was a fuzzy heady kid
[1:38:42] on the front row. He used to rub my
[1:38:44] hair.
[1:38:50] That's a story for another day,
[1:38:54] too. It's a real simple question. Okay.
[1:38:57] How do you have a weather forecast
[1:38:59] without a weather man?
[1:39:03] Simple question. How do you get a
[1:39:06] message without a messenger?
[1:39:09] [Applause]
[1:39:10] I'm a dumb Tennessee boy. Then how do
[1:39:15] you get a prophecy
[1:39:18] without a prophet?
[1:39:21] You don't get a weather forecast without
[1:39:22] a weatherman. And you don't get a
[1:39:24] message without a messenger. And you
[1:39:26] don't get a prophecy without a prophet.
[1:39:29] The Bible said the Lord God will do
[1:39:31] nothing but he revealth his secrets unto
[1:39:33] his servants the prophets. Brother Ram
[1:39:35] come along and said see what they had
[1:39:37] the people then they had understanding
[1:39:39] through the word of the Lord by the
[1:39:42] prophets. He said see the prophet is a
[1:39:44] special man. What he's doing is he
[1:39:46] climbs way
[1:39:48] up. He climbs way up and he starts
[1:39:51] looking at what he's seeing. And while
[1:39:53] he's seeing it, he starts saying it.
[1:39:57] Can I just say what he says? He's saying
[1:40:01] what he's looking at.
[1:40:03] It ain't here yet, but it sure will be.
[1:40:09] He climbs up in that realm and he looks
[1:40:12] way out into the future and he says,
[1:40:14] "Listen, I see a redeemer."
[1:40:18] And he comes back and he records it. And
[1:40:21] there's 4,000 years between the time he
[1:40:24] sees it and the time it arrives. But it
[1:40:27] don't change the fact it's going to
[1:40:28] happen. Brother said the prophet's only
[1:40:30] looking off and seeing something and
[1:40:32] he's talking about what he's looking at.
[1:40:34] He ain't thinking about it here. What
[1:40:36] you look like now. He's looking at
[1:40:38] what's going to be. And when he speaks
[1:40:40] that, if it's in the word of the Lord,
[1:40:43] it's already been spoken. And there's
[1:40:46] nothing in the world can stop it. You
[1:40:50] see that's right. Only God
[1:40:53] himself. Now that's a powerful point,
[1:40:56] church. Only God can stop this bride
[1:40:58] from taking a
[1:41:01] rapture. Only God can stop you from
[1:41:03] overcoming. But come on, church. If
[1:41:06] you're underneath the sick sense, not
[1:41:07] even God can stop
[1:41:11] you. I know what you're saying. You're
[1:41:13] saying, "Preacher, you're getting way
[1:41:14] out there." Remember the woman that
[1:41:16] Brother said, "Come to Jesus." And she
[1:41:18] said, "Would you heal my child?" And he
[1:41:20] said, "Listen, it ain't meat for me to
[1:41:21] give the bread to the
[1:41:23] dogs. Get on out of here, dogs. Get on
[1:41:26] out of here. It ain't custom for me to
[1:41:28] give bread to the dogs." You know what
[1:41:30] she did? She got down under the table
[1:41:33] and she said, "But even the
[1:41:37] dogs." But Daryl, even the dogs eat the
[1:41:40] crumbs that fall from the master's
[1:41:42] table. You know why? Because she had
[1:41:45] another sense.
[1:41:47] She had another sense and another sense
[1:41:49] is a revelation. And the revelation was,
[1:41:52] I've seen mama make bread before. And
[1:41:55] when she made a loaf of bread, she put
[1:41:57] flour, she put wheat, she put salt, she
[1:41:59] put sugar in there, and whatever is in
[1:42:02] the
[1:42:03] loaf is also in the
[1:42:06] crumb. If there's healing in the loaf,
[1:42:08] then there's healing in the crumb. If
[1:42:10] there's deliverance in the loaf, then
[1:42:12] there's deliverance in the crumb. I'm
[1:42:14] talking about a people who have received
[1:42:16] another sense through the preaching of
[1:42:19] the message of the
[1:42:20] hour. When you look at this word
[1:42:22] broadcast, brother said this message, he
[1:42:24] said it's going to be broadcast. Now, I
[1:42:26] find it very amazing. Amen. That
[1:42:28] forecast are usually broadcast in paper
[1:42:32] form as well as radio form. Yeah. Do you
[1:42:36] realize we got a spiritual forecast and
[1:42:38] it's come to us in book form
[1:42:43] and tape form? And brother said it's
[1:42:45] going to be broadcast to all. He said
[1:42:47] look at this word broadcast. I'm going
[1:42:49] to read a definition. It means transmit.
[1:42:51] I love this one, brother Matt. It means
[1:42:54] to scatter seeds. You already preached
[1:42:56] so I ain't going to preach it. It means
[1:42:58] to scatter seeds. It means to tell many.
[1:43:02] Now I love this part. though only a few
[1:43:04] will catch it.
[1:43:08] Another word for broadcast is so Matt
[1:43:11] read it Thursday night. He will plant
[1:43:14] the seed of the entire Bible. He said,
[1:43:17] "See, so the seed is just so." Now, let
[1:43:19] me say this. That's the reason I don't
[1:43:21] study Billy Graham.
[1:43:24] God bless Billy Graham. God bless Lord
[1:43:26] Roberts. But I don't study them guys cuz
[1:43:28] I don't have time
[1:43:29] to. I I felt that devil pushed back at
[1:43:33] me. It's a bad spot. I got a sword. I
[1:43:35] don't have time to study them men
[1:43:37] because that's not whose seed I'm under.
[1:43:40] I'm not under a denominational seed. I'm
[1:43:42] not under a Pentecostal seed. I'm under
[1:43:45] a word seed. If you want to stay in
[1:43:47] Leosa, if you want to keep living by the
[1:43:50] five senses, then keep bearing your head
[1:43:52] in Billy Graham's library and bearing
[1:43:54] your head in Oral Roberts and burying
[1:43:55] your head in J. But if you want to lift
[1:43:57] up your head, Amen. Get under the rain
[1:44:00] of the Holy Ghost that has the power,
[1:44:02] amen, to bring a life to that seed. Can
[1:44:05] I say this to you? This message is the
[1:44:07] calling out of the bride. Rebraham said,
[1:44:11] "See in my heart." Amen. Can I Can I
[1:44:13] just show you something here? Amen. Can
[1:44:14] I show you something? There's a way to
[1:44:16] differentiate between the three souls.
[1:44:18] Three sers and the three seeds. Not
[1:44:19] three souls. God, that'll be all over
[1:44:20] the world by morning. Three sers and
[1:44:24] three seeds.
[1:44:28] Don't leave this tent,
[1:44:31] Kenny. I love Brother Kitty. Billy
[1:44:34] Graham stood there and he said, "I know
[1:44:37] God is moving. I feel God is moving.
[1:44:41] He's moving all over the world." And God
[1:44:43] bless brother Billy. But let's bring it
[1:44:45] to Oral Roberts. He stood there and
[1:44:48] said, "I feel God is moving in this
[1:44:49] building. He's in here somewhere right
[1:44:51] now. He's moving in that the Pentecost
[1:44:53] anointing. He's moving in here somewhere
[1:44:55] right now." Hallelujah. Glory to God.
[1:44:56] Sh.
[1:44:57] a shout. Glory to God. He's moving. But
[1:45:00] now let's come to a prophet who stood
[1:45:02] there and he didn't say I feel he's
[1:45:03] moving all over the world and I feel
[1:45:06] he's moving in this building. But he
[1:45:08] stood there under the six sense and said
[1:45:10] I know he's not 3 ft from where I'm
[1:45:13] standing. Do you see what the difference
[1:45:15] was? It was the turning of a corner. It
[1:45:18] was the changing of the rhetoric. It was
[1:45:21] the change of the preaching. It was
[1:45:23] changing from there's something coming.
[1:45:25] There's something coming to saying
[1:45:27] there's something here. What you're
[1:45:29] looking for is not on its way. Praise
[1:45:31] God, brother Sean. Put your shouting
[1:45:33] shoes on. It is arrived. What you're
[1:45:36] looking for is
[1:45:41] here. He stood right there and said,
[1:45:43] "This is my ministry." To declare him,
[1:45:45] he's here.
[1:45:47] He stood right there and he cares. Do
[1:45:48] you care? 63. He said, "Now he's here. I
[1:45:51] know he's here." Listen what he says. My
[1:45:54] faith,
[1:45:56] not my feelings, not my sight, not my
[1:45:59] memory, not my education. My faith, my
[1:46:03] faith says he is here.
[1:46:08] See, there was a difference happening.
[1:46:10] We were moving from seeking
[1:46:13] signs. We were moving from seeking signs
[1:46:16] to recognizing signs.
[1:46:19] We were moving from a wicked and an
[1:46:22] adulterous generation. You want to be
[1:46:24] strong? Anybody want to be strong?
[1:46:27] Anybody want to be strong? I'm going
[1:46:29] tell you how you be strong. Okay. As
[1:46:31] much as you can. Amen. What a prophet
[1:46:33] said.
[1:46:37] You're only as strong as your adherence
[1:46:39] to the word of God.
[1:46:42] Now, the Bible said, "A wicked and
[1:46:44] adulterous generation." I'm feeling good
[1:46:46] this morning. It's Sunday morning and
[1:46:49] The Bible says, "A wicked and adulterous
[1:46:52] generation
[1:46:54] seeketh after a sign." Brother Brown
[1:46:56] preached it one time. He said, "A wicked
[1:46:57] is a weak and adulterous generation." It
[1:47:00] seeketh after a sign, but watch, "But
[1:47:02] there'll be no sign except that of the
[1:47:05] prophet Jonas." Do you realize Jeremiah
[1:47:07] said, "Be not dismayed at the signs of
[1:47:10] the heaven or the signs of the earth, at
[1:47:12] the signs of heaven. For the heathen are
[1:47:14] dismayed at them." Reb said, "Listen,
[1:47:16] the unbeliever is discouraged." He said,
[1:47:18] "The heathen is the unbeliever and
[1:47:20] dismayed means discouraged." Are you
[1:47:22] with me? He said, "The signs of heaven,
[1:47:25] it just makes an unbeliever pout and
[1:47:28] angry." When they see the signs of the
[1:47:31] heaven, it makes them pout and angry. Do
[1:47:34] you see the difference in the bride in
[1:47:36] the Pentecostal age? We don't use the
[1:47:38] rapture to scare you.
[1:47:40] [Applause]
[1:47:41] Ain't no message preacher running around
[1:47:43] preaching God's going to burn your
[1:47:44] barley fields. Aa All and all them guys
[1:47:46] done preached it till you couldn't
[1:47:47] preach it no more because they were
[1:47:50] trying to move you by fear into your
[1:47:52] position. But Joshua was not moving you
[1:47:54] by fear. He was moving you by
[1:47:56] revelation. He knew if fear put you in
[1:47:59] something else could scare you out. But
[1:48:01] if the revelation of Jesus Christ, which
[1:48:04] was prophesied from the book of
[1:48:06] Zechariah and fulfilled in First Peter,
[1:48:08] ever struck your heart, it would move
[1:48:10] you from a fearful condition into a
[1:48:12] position of faith and authority and
[1:48:15] sunship over every
[1:48:16] [Applause]
[1:48:17] devil. But to the believer, it's a
[1:48:20] vindication. The truth of God's word,
[1:48:22] it's coming signs. He said, "See, it's
[1:48:25] honey in the rock." Oh, glory to the
[1:48:29] believers. It's honey in the rock.
[1:48:34] I can't sing, but I wish I could right
[1:48:35] now. There's honey in the rock, my
[1:48:37] brother.
[1:48:42] I'm feeling good this morning. And a
[1:48:44] rock is a
[1:48:46] revelation. So for every repbate that
[1:48:49] says this message is dead and is cooling
[1:48:51] off, there's still honey in the rock.
[1:48:55] for every backsliding preacher that
[1:48:57] ain't got the guts to stand on a
[1:48:58] platform and say what a prophet said.
[1:49:03] But Darl, I got to feeling bad the other
[1:49:05] day and I got to thinking maybe my
[1:49:07] brother Elijah's spirit's coming out too
[1:49:09] much in me when I say things. And then I
[1:49:11] heard my big brother Elijah on tape. He
[1:49:13] said, "If you ain't going to tell the
[1:49:14] truth, then shut up and do something
[1:49:15] else." I said, "My God, there's my
[1:49:18] brother." Listen, if you ain't going to
[1:49:20] preach this message, then shut up and
[1:49:22] let God's people go, cuz there's a
[1:49:24] rapture to take. There's a body change
[1:49:26] to experience. There's devils to
[1:49:28] overcome. Listen, there's still honey in
[1:49:30] the
[1:49:31] rock. There's still power in this
[1:49:33] message, Brother Ronnie. Go preach it in
[1:49:35] Mexico. It'll still heal cancer. Go
[1:49:38] preach it, Brother Matt. It'll still
[1:49:39] deliver young people. Go preach in
[1:49:41] Africa, Brother Jonathan. And while
[1:49:43] you're preaching it, cancers will
[1:49:45] disappear because there's still honey in
[1:49:47] the sign of the coming of the
[1:49:51] Lord. The message of the hour is a sign.
[1:49:54] That's why we're not just looking for a
[1:49:55] first pull. We're not just looking for a
[1:49:57] second pull. We're not just looking for
[1:49:59] a good time. We're looking for a third
[1:50:01] pull.
[1:50:05] But Rem said when you see something
[1:50:06] happening on earth, he said then there
[1:50:08] is a true representation in the I'm
[1:50:12] sorry I just got relaxed this
[1:50:14] morning in the true representation in
[1:50:17] the spiritual realms of the other
[1:50:20] dimension.
[1:50:23] Now when did somebody go to Billy Graham
[1:50:25] or Roberts and say, "My child died. I'm
[1:50:27] not sure where they're at." Yeah.
[1:50:31] And him go search the regions of the
[1:50:33] lost.
[1:50:36] And come back and say they're not there.
[1:50:40] Well, brother Sean, if they weren't
[1:50:41] there, there's only one other place they
[1:50:42] could be.
[1:50:45] Oh, glory to God. What is it? We've gone
[1:50:48] beyond the horse and buggy. We've gone
[1:50:50] beyond the automobile. We've gone beyond
[1:50:53] the airplane. We've climbed up into the
[1:50:55] astronaut age, which is the message of
[1:50:57] the hour. Somebody say, "Why are you all
[1:50:59] preaching the message?" Because we see
[1:51:01] it.
[1:51:03] And if anybody sees anything, they want
[1:51:05] to talk about it. And if anywhere we
[1:51:07] ought to be able to talk about this
[1:51:09] message, ought to be in message
[1:51:10] [Applause]
[1:51:13] churches. I met that devil when I was a
[1:51:16] 16-year-old boy. Don't quote brother Ram
[1:51:18] in my pull pit. Well, I'm still here
[1:51:20] almost 30 years old and I'm still
[1:51:22] quoting Brother Brandham because there's
[1:51:24] honey in the rock. Hey, there's honey in
[1:51:27] this message. There's another sense in
[1:51:29] this message. I don't go by the way I
[1:51:31] feel. I don't go by the way preachers
[1:51:32] think this message ought to be preached.
[1:51:34] I have received another sense. And I
[1:51:37] say, God forgive us. And God forbid the
[1:51:39] day ever come that we reduce this
[1:51:41] message down to just some little idea on
[1:51:44] the shelf somewhere.
[1:51:45] [Applause]
[1:51:47] It's the Bible being fulfilled. It's the
[1:51:49] prophecy of Isaiah. Reson. It's here.
[1:51:52] It's happening right before you in the
[1:51:54] name of the Lord. Don't miss it.
[1:51:58] Don't miss it.
[1:52:05] The evening time message is here.
[1:52:10] Brother Daryl, what was in God's mind is
[1:52:13] now in God's church. How did it get in
[1:52:17] there? They have not all believed the
[1:52:19] gospel, but whom they were sent preached
[1:52:22] the report or they forecasted.
[1:52:26] Now I'm just going I'm just going to
[1:52:28] read this to you. Everybody okay?
[1:52:31] We're getting ready to experience some
[1:52:32] turbulence and rough air.
[1:52:34] So we are only transmitters that
[1:52:38] transmits the voice of God through our
[1:52:39] agency of men to the hearer. So listen,
[1:52:41] a vision is the same way. I know nothing
[1:52:44] to say to the church at this time
[1:52:46] concerning a vision. But if the Holy
[1:52:48] Spirit would show first me a vision,
[1:52:50] then I transmit that vision to the one
[1:52:52] that it's directed to.
[1:52:55] It's not a general vision, church. It's
[1:52:58] to It's Brother Ronnie. It's laser
[1:53:00] guided. See, it was not me. The vision
[1:53:04] was not me. I It was God gave the
[1:53:08] vision. And I acted as a transmitter.
[1:53:11] Listen, to bring forth the message of
[1:53:14] the vision to the people. So, we don't
[1:53:16] just have a vision, but there's a
[1:53:19] message behind the vision. I love what
[1:53:21] brother says. He said, "See, how can
[1:53:24] you, a drunkard a few weeks ago and a
[1:53:25] few months ago, be a gentleman today, a
[1:53:27] harlot a few weeks ago, and a lady this
[1:53:29] afternoon? By the transforming power of
[1:53:31] God being transmitted by the Holy Ghost
[1:53:34] into your heart, it changed your nature,
[1:53:37] it changed your making, it made you
[1:53:40] another person."
[1:53:42] I love this. But God is thankful and
[1:53:45] loyal anyhow
[1:53:47] to keep his people posted.
[1:53:52] God is thankful and he's loyal to keep
[1:53:56] his people posted.
[1:54:00] Can I say it? We ain't a bunch of
[1:54:02] dummies.
[1:54:07] It's Elijah coming out.
[1:54:09] So, let's quit burying our head in the
[1:54:11] sand
[1:54:14] and saying, "Well, we'll just go on as
[1:54:16] if nothing's happening." Are you crazy?
[1:54:20] Do you not see what's happening?
[1:54:23] Well, nothing's happening. Well, I'm
[1:54:25] sorry. I am what's happening.
[1:54:28] But Robson, you are what's happening.
[1:54:31] This bride is what's happening. We're
[1:54:33] looking for something to happen. Listen,
[1:54:35] the message of the hour has opened our
[1:54:37] eyes to what is happening. Listen, God
[1:54:39] keeps his people posted by the six
[1:54:41] sense. Can I say something to you? We're
[1:54:44] not dummies when it comes to the
[1:54:45] rapture.
[1:54:47] We're not looking for driverless cars on
[1:54:49] Interstate 85 and bodies floating
[1:54:51] through the airways and and buildings.
[1:54:53] No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[1:54:56] We have received a vision. But there was
[1:54:58] a message behind that vision. And he
[1:55:00] said, I want you to be posted to know
[1:55:02] what's to take place for the age we live
[1:55:05] in. See, can I ask you this question?
[1:55:07] How near are we?
[1:55:10] Come on, brother Daryl. Amen. How closer
[1:55:13] do we are today than the day you first
[1:55:15] preached your first sermon? Come on,
[1:55:18] church. Amen. Brother Jonah, you're just
[1:55:20] a young man, but how closer are we today
[1:55:22] than just a few years ago when you was
[1:55:24] born?
[1:55:26] I've not lost my subject, folks. How
[1:55:28] near are we? Reb said, "You don't know
[1:55:31] how near you are to home. I trust you'll
[1:55:33] put purpose in your heart and wrestle
[1:55:35] with the angel and not let him go till
[1:55:36] you're blessed. Brother, sister, I'm
[1:55:38] just a lump of clay. Don't you pay any
[1:55:41] attention to me, but you listen to what
[1:55:43] I'm saying. The coming of the Lord is
[1:55:46] drawing near.
[1:55:49] I don't know how near. No one knows. But
[1:55:52] I believe it's real close at hand. I see
[1:55:54] everything just to happening. I want to
[1:55:56] be ready. How near are we? Can I ask you
[1:56:00] another question? Then where are we at?
[1:56:03] If you're going from Oklahoma to
[1:56:05] Virginia, you got to pass through
[1:56:06] Missouri and you got to pass through uh
[1:56:08] through Tennessee for a long time and
[1:56:10] then you finally make it to Virginia.
[1:56:12] Listen, you don't just get in the
[1:56:14] Oklahoma and and get in the car by the
[1:56:15] window and guess your way out here.
[1:56:17] There's
[1:56:19] milepost. Can I have a little liberty
[1:56:21] here? There's milepost. Amen. And
[1:56:24] they're telling you 500 more miles, 300
[1:56:26] more miles. What they're doing is
[1:56:28] they're showing you you're getting
[1:56:29] closer. They're answering questions. If
[1:56:32] you'll just open your eyes, but if you
[1:56:34] sleep in the time you get in the car,
[1:56:35] you're going to miss all the signpost.
[1:56:37] But if you want to catch it, you got to
[1:56:39] let that six sense. Amen. Begin to
[1:56:41] declare to you things that are showing.
[1:56:43] The coming of the Lord is at
[1:56:46] hand. Said, "Where we at? We're at the
[1:56:48] end time. The world has fallen apart.
[1:56:51] The rapture is upon us." Amen. Can I
[1:56:53] Amen. Amen. I can't I can't I cannot let
[1:56:55] this I cannot let this opportunity pass
[1:56:57] me to preach this this morning. Let's
[1:56:59] look at our spiritual forecast. 1954, I
[1:57:03] believe, one of these glorious days when
[1:57:05] this United Confederation of Churches
[1:57:07] goes together and the new pope is
[1:57:10] brought out of the United States and put
[1:57:12] over
[1:57:14] there according to
[1:57:17] feelings, according to
[1:57:19] education, according to standing in the
[1:57:22] Catholic church, according to prophecy.
[1:57:26] Brother Steve, I wish I had the I wish I
[1:57:28] had the guy that wears address his phone
[1:57:30] number right now that's going to be the
[1:57:31] next pope. I'd call him up and say,
[1:57:33] "Buddy, you ain't going because of how
[1:57:35] good you've been."
[1:57:37] If he's the one, he's going according to
[1:57:41] prophecy. They'll form an image like
[1:57:43] unto the beast. And I tell you, church
[1:57:45] of God will be drove together. Listen
[1:57:48] what he said. He said there's a there's
[1:57:50] a book of Revelation. It's a prophetic
[1:57:51] book, right? Amen. There's symbols in
[1:57:53] that book. Amen. He said, "Look at
[1:57:55] Revelation 13:11 and 17." He said, "In
[1:57:58] there, there's things called beast." He
[1:57:59] said, "Now, there's a Greek word theion,
[1:58:01] which means a wild untamed beast." He
[1:58:04] said, "It's not like," Amen. the zoo or
[1:58:06] the living creature. He said, "It's a
[1:58:08] Theion." He said, "In other words, if
[1:58:10] you'll watch the 11th chapter, are you
[1:58:12] is this okay?"
[1:58:14] If you'll watch the 11th chapter, the
[1:58:16] beast of Rome, the 13th chapter, the
[1:58:19] United States, and the 17th chapter,
[1:58:22] both United States and
[1:58:24] Rome of the
[1:58:36] denominational churches,
[1:58:38] then why in God's name are we inviting
[1:58:41] that mess into our churches?
[1:58:46] I may not ever have another pull pit to
[1:58:48] preach in this morning, but you're going
[1:58:49] to hear the truth. That is a wicked
[1:58:51] beast. It is a wicked system. It has
[1:58:54] come up out of the pits of hell. And we
[1:58:56] ought to put our foot on the head of
[1:58:58] that beast. It don't belong in our
[1:59:00] churches. It don't belong around our
[1:59:01] young
[1:59:03] people. Well, we're just trying to
[1:59:06] fellowship. Brother Matt sung that song
[1:59:08] tonight. Amen. Amen.
[1:59:11] Can I borrow it? It's a small world
[1:59:13] after all. Y'all heard that? Heard him
[1:59:16] say that. It's a small road after all.
[1:59:18] Well, well, Matt, I didn't beat my head
[1:59:19] on the back of the bunks going through
[1:59:21] that. Me and Joe Adams was out in
[1:59:23] California and we took our families to
[1:59:24] Disney and we rode through that and and
[1:59:26] then Brother Ronnie, we went to sleep.
[1:59:28] So, I don't know what they sung, but I
[1:59:30] know when we got out, everybody's
[1:59:31] saying, "It's a small world after all."
[1:59:33] And he and he got to singing that about
[1:59:35] how they say they they so designed the
[1:59:36] world to make it small. And you know
[1:59:38] what a lot of preachers have done is
[1:59:39] they've so designed this message to make
[1:59:41] it just another denomination or just
[1:59:43] another little idea or just something
[1:59:44] that come along out of Kentucky or was
[1:59:46] hashed out of Arizona. And now they're
[1:59:48] all singing this song. We're all one
[1:59:50] after all. I mean, we're all one after
[1:59:53] all.
[1:59:55] Can I preach? Amen. I'll say this. I'm
[1:59:57] not one of them.
[1:59:59] I refuse to lay down this message and
[2:00:02] become one of them. God who is rich in
[2:00:05] mercy. When the world was falling apart,
[2:00:07] he came to this old job and he gave me
[2:00:10] another sense. And it was a super sense.
[2:00:12] It was a powerful sense. It was a
[2:00:14] positive sense. It was a
[2:00:18] revelation. Revelation 13:4. And they
[2:00:20] worship the dragon, which gave power in
[2:00:22] the beast. Let me let me back up. I'm I
[2:00:24] know it's getting late, but I'm going to
[2:00:25] preach. The denominational churches will
[2:00:28] consolidate with Catholicism and make
[2:00:31] them an unconverted
[2:00:36] Can I preach?
[2:00:40] When in God's name do we start taking
[2:00:41] our young people to denominational
[2:00:43] churches
[2:00:46] and blessing that mess and then coming
[2:00:48] to a pull pit
[2:00:51] and saying we're just all one. We don't
[2:00:53] want to preach no doctrine. I say get
[2:00:55] out of the pull pit pansy and get you a
[2:00:57] backbone. But doctrine of this message
[2:00:59] is the only thing that's keeping us from
[2:01:02] falling away in the great falling
[2:01:04] away. We don't need doctrine. Where did
[2:01:07] that lie come from? I'll tell you where
[2:01:09] it come from. It come from the pits of
[2:01:10] hell. But I'll put my foot on that lie
[2:01:12] this morning. If there's anything our
[2:01:14] young people need, it's the sound Holy
[2:01:17] Ghost teaching of the message of the
[2:01:19] hour. We need to preach it in our
[2:01:20] meetings. We need to preach it in our
[2:01:22] churches. We need to preach it in our
[2:01:23] homes. Let everywhere hear. God has sent
[2:01:26] a message and it's a revelation. And no,
[2:01:30] we're not one after all. We've been
[2:01:32] called out. We have been separated from
[2:01:36] [Applause]
[2:01:38] unbelief. Yeah. Go ahead and play with
[2:01:40] that system. Amen. Think, young people.
[2:01:42] Oh,
[2:01:43] God. Who you after this morning? I'm
[2:01:46] after the devil cuz I'm a little sick of
[2:01:48] the devil trying to water down my
[2:01:51] inheritance down there bobbed hair faces
[2:01:54] and married four and five times deacons
[2:01:56] and women wearing shorts and men wearing
[2:01:58] short and then go back to your pull pit
[2:01:59] and wonder why makeup's coming back in.
[2:02:02] You ain't got no standard to correct it
[2:02:04] [Applause]
[2:02:05] by when you lay this message down. I can
[2:02:09] show you
[2:02:10] one Elijah's coming out too strong right
[2:02:13] now. hold it
[2:02:14] back. I can tell you one of them big
[2:02:16] boys about 2 hours down the road and
[2:02:18] said he can make it without this message
[2:02:20] and look where he's at today. Amen.
[2:02:22] Ain't God but a handful of people. You
[2:02:23] know why? Because the message is
[2:02:25] different. This is not a Pentecostal
[2:02:27] message. This is not a return of 1906.
[2:02:30] This is a revelation of authority coming
[2:02:33] to sunships to position you as a Joshua
[2:02:36] generation living under another
[2:02:40] sense. And the day I get too big to say
[2:02:43] what a prophet said in the pullpit is
[2:02:44] the day I'll quit
[2:02:47] preaching cuz I do not believe I can say
[2:02:50] oh god it's the last day of the meeting.
[2:02:52] Why am I preaching like this? People say
[2:02:54] we don't quote quotes. I know why they
[2:02:55] don't want to quote quotes. It's cuz
[2:02:57] they think they can say it better than
[2:02:58] brother Brandham. Well sorry buddy you
[2:03:00] can't say it no better than he said. He
[2:03:02] can say more in a prayer than some guys
[2:03:04] can say in three
[2:03:06] hours because it was the oracles of God.
[2:03:09] It was grace. It was prophetic grace
[2:03:12] appearing to a prophetic class of
[2:03:15] [Applause]
[2:03:17] people and they worshiped the dragon
[2:03:20] which gave power in the beast and they
[2:03:22] worshiped the beast.
[2:03:24] Come on.
[2:03:26] This beast rose up and they started
[2:03:28] worshiping him and they started saying
[2:03:30] this. Who is like unto the beast?
[2:03:35] Brother Jonathan,
[2:03:37] who is able to make war with him?
[2:03:40] Brother B said, right now Rome's calling
[2:03:42] the tune. Yeah, that's right. That's why
[2:03:45] you're down there fellowship them little
[2:03:46] Baptists and Pentecostals and
[2:03:47] denominationals and
[2:03:49] we're all one. Well, Rome's singing your
[2:03:51] song.
[2:03:56] The pope is in the driver's seat, folks.
[2:03:59] Direct quote. And the power is only
[2:04:02] going to increase. Look what he said
[2:04:05] here. He said it's now somebody say,
[2:04:07] "Well, brother Andrew, you got to be
[2:04:08] real careful cuz you you'll get to
[2:04:10] beating on them people." Let me let me
[2:04:12] make this very plain and put it out
[2:04:14] there. I am not beating on people.
[2:04:18] I am beating a fire out of a spirit.
[2:04:23] But preach, why we're not a denomination
[2:04:26] and why I'm against organized religion.
[2:04:28] And you know what he said? He preached
[2:04:29] about six hours in both sermons put
[2:04:31] together. I can put those two sermons
[2:04:33] about 6 hours in one sense for you. Are
[2:04:35] you ready? It's not the people, it's the
[2:04:39] system. That's why there was a voice to
[2:04:41] call you out of it. Brother said they
[2:04:44] were baptizing in my name. He said they
[2:04:46] were worshiping me. He said I'm going to
[2:04:47] walk off the field. He said, "I'm not
[2:04:49] going to preach no more." And then he
[2:04:51] said something, brother Ronnie, that's
[2:04:52] brought me through so many dark trials
[2:04:54] and so many hurts and so many troubles.
[2:04:56] Here's what he said. He said, "It's a
[2:04:58] spirit on precious people.
[2:05:03] It's not the person, it's a spirit on
[2:05:06] precious people." Now, now I'll say this
[2:05:09] and I I don't have time to read it when
[2:05:10] you get home. Amen. Amen. I'm going to
[2:05:13] answer a question. We're going to go
[2:05:15] eat. God, we got to lighten it up here.
[2:05:18] Somebody drop the oxygen mask out and
[2:05:19] put the seat belts on.
[2:05:22] And flight attendant deacons, take your
[2:05:27] seat. No one can make war with this
[2:05:30] beast. No one could overcome him. Amen.
[2:05:33] Can I Can I show you where we're at? Can
[2:05:35] you give me that first picture? I've
[2:05:37] been looking for this picture for years.
[2:05:39] I was a I was a probably nineyear-old
[2:05:42] boy when I seen brother Ed Bisl preach
[2:05:44] down at brother Donny's one time. And
[2:05:45] some of y'all probably remember he put
[2:05:47] this picture up 2005. I've been looking
[2:05:49] for this picture for years and I finally
[2:05:51] found it the other day. And that right
[2:05:53] there is John Paul II's funeral in April
[2:05:55] of 2005. Okay. Do you see who's who's
[2:05:59] not standing there
[2:06:02] paying respects?
[2:06:04] George W. Bush, George H. Bush, Bill
[2:06:08] Clinton, world leaders are bowed down
[2:06:12] next to this beast.
[2:06:16] Is this okay, brother Sean? They're
[2:06:18] bowed down next to it. You know what
[2:06:20] they're saying? They're saying it's
[2:06:22] wonderful. I don't have time to read all
[2:06:23] the articles, but they're there. They're
[2:06:25] saying it's wonderful. This is, you know
[2:06:27] what they called it? They called it a
[2:06:28] real spiritual move when all these
[2:06:30] presidents and all these religious
[2:06:32] leaders, you know what Billy, you know
[2:06:33] what Billy Graham called this? Bless his
[2:06:35] heart, he called it glorious and
[2:06:37] wonderful that our presidents, Amen,
[2:06:39] could step there or bow beside that
[2:06:41] image. Can I say something to you?
[2:06:44] Catholicism, the beast of revelation.
[2:06:48] Can you give me that next
[2:06:50] picture? That's that's in
[2:06:53] 2023 when Pope Benedict the 16th died.
[2:06:56] Amen. Right there. Amen. Probably
[2:06:58] somebody was trying to take his place.
[2:07:00] Now, am I seeing that right, Brother
[2:07:02] Kenny? Kissing that man's ring.
[2:07:06] Well, Brother Andrew, you wouldn't hear
[2:07:07] this in a Baptist church. You're right.
[2:07:09] Cuz we're not Baptist. We're original
[2:07:10] seed.
[2:07:12] [Applause]
[2:07:14] kissing a dead corpse's ring. Can you
[2:07:18] give me the next
[2:07:20] picture? Just a few days ago, Pope
[2:07:23] Francis dies and there's all the I'm
[2:07:26] sorry. There's all the rest of them
[2:07:29] bowing. They're not walking by and just
[2:07:31] looking at him. They're bowing down and
[2:07:33] worshiping. Can you give me the next
[2:07:35] picture? Even big bad Trump standing
[2:07:38] there.
[2:07:42] because it's a power that you cannot
[2:07:44] resist unless God sends a message. It's
[2:07:48] a force that'll take over everything.
[2:07:50] Unless God sends a
[2:07:53] message. What are you saying? I'm saying
[2:07:55] right there. Amen. Right there. Just a
[2:07:57] few days ago, they interviewed Trump on
[2:07:59] an airplane. He said, "I'm a busy man
[2:08:01] running the world, making negotiations
[2:08:03] and doing all kind of deals." He said,
[2:08:05] "But I've got to go." He said, "I just
[2:08:07] got to go over there." When Pope John
[2:08:09] Paul II died, there was a man standing
[2:08:12] and he said in who's in position in the
[2:08:13] airport, he would stand there and he
[2:08:15] said these words, "When I heard the Pope
[2:08:17] died, some of these worshippers that
[2:08:19] come out of this mess are shouting with
[2:08:21] me while some of them critical religious
[2:08:22] spirits are sitting on me. It's a bad
[2:08:24] spot to sit." He said, "I had to drop
[2:08:27] everything I was doing and I had to go."
[2:08:29] You know why? Because mama's calling.
[2:08:33] Mama's calling. She's wanting them all
[2:08:35] to come home. She's wanting them all to
[2:08:37] come home. But can I tell you how near
[2:08:39] we are? Can I tell you where we're at?
[2:08:42] Give me that next
[2:08:44] picture. Just the other day, the
[2:08:47] cardinal could be the first superpower
[2:08:49] pope
[2:08:52] from the
[2:08:54] US. Now, I couldn't preach this in a
[2:08:56] denominational church cuz it's
[2:08:58] discouraged them. But I can preach it to
[2:09:00] you all and you all shout
[2:09:03] hallelujah. You know why? Because while
[2:09:05] mama's calling her babies home, while
[2:09:09] mama's calling her daughters home, while
[2:09:11] mama's swallowed up politics and
[2:09:14] swallowing up the economy and swallowed
[2:09:16] up nations and swallowed up religion, I
[2:09:19] heard a voice from the seventh angel.
[2:09:21] And he said, "If I lift up
[2:09:24] Christ," Hallelujah. My mama ain't My
[2:09:28] mama ain't in Rome. My daddy Who's your
[2:09:31] daddy, Matt? Who's your daddy? Preached
[2:09:33] it years ago. Who's your daddy? My daddy
[2:09:35] is the word. My daddy is the word. And
[2:09:38] you know what he's doing? He's drawing
[2:09:40] me home while they're dropping things
[2:09:42] and they got to go to Rome to worship a
[2:09:47] corpse. Can I knock one more devil
[2:09:50] out? Can I knock one more devil out?
[2:09:53] Mom's calling and they got to go. The
[2:09:55] forecast said they got to go. the
[2:09:57] forecast said I got to drop what I'm
[2:09:59] doing and I got to go pay respects
[2:10:06] now. Now people that's in that horrid
[2:10:09] Rick wicked
[2:10:11] system. Can you can you go back and go
[2:10:13] through them pictures for me? The one
[2:10:15] before that. You see that? Ain't nobody
[2:10:19] got a problem with that. Give me the
[2:10:21] next one. Ain't nobody got a problem
[2:10:23] with that. Give me the next one.
[2:10:26] It's wonderful, brother Sean. Ain't
[2:10:28] nobody got a problem with that. Can you
[2:10:31] give me that last one?
[2:10:38] [Applause]
[2:10:39] But everybody got a problem with that
[2:10:42] one. You know why? You know why? Because
[2:10:46] I got the quote right here. He said,
[2:10:48] "They're worshiping a corpse." He said,
[2:10:50] "But we're not here, Amen, worshiping a
[2:10:52] corpse. We're not here honoring a
[2:10:54] corpse. We're hailing a
[2:10:56] conqueror. Woo! Glory. Somebody give me
[2:11:00] some shout room in the house of God. I
[2:11:02] ain't bound by the pope. I ain't kissing
[2:11:05] his ring. I ain't worshiping him. I
[2:11:07] ain't going to call him holy and
[2:11:08] spiritual. But I have seen the
[2:11:11] resurrection of the God of Abraham
[2:11:13] return in my
[2:11:15] generation. That's not a corpse above
[2:11:17] his head. It's a conqueror. He's already
[2:11:20] whipped cancer. He's already whipped
[2:11:22] homosexuality. He's already whipped
[2:11:24] denomination. He's whipped politics.
[2:11:26] He's whipped education. He's whipped
[2:11:28] depression. He's whipped nervousness.
[2:11:30] And he's right here. And he's going to
[2:11:32] whip that devil out of your way. And
[2:11:34] that bit of fire is going to put you in
[2:11:37] the changing of your
[2:11:40] [Applause]
[2:11:41] body. Hallelujah. Somebody shout aloud
[2:11:45] in the house of
[2:11:46] God. We got a
[2:11:49] message. We got a message.
[2:11:52] [Applause]
[2:11:54] Josh, we didn't miss it. We didn't miss
[2:11:58] it.
[2:12:02] [Applause]
[2:12:08] Brother Wendle, come stand right there
[2:12:10] where you about where you were standing
[2:12:11] last night. There by that right there.
[2:12:12] That's
[2:12:14] good. Brother Jonah, come here and stand
[2:12:18] right in front of brother window like
[2:12:20] you're going through a prayer line.
[2:12:23] Y'all forgive me. Last night if I and I
[2:12:26] checked out for a minute in prayer line,
[2:12:27] I was praising
[2:12:29] God. I'm just grip my heart, brother
[2:12:31] Diego. This man of God's just labored
[2:12:35] for an hour and a half piling scripture
[2:12:38] upon quote about the grace of God and
[2:12:41] what God can do and how there's a
[2:12:44] destroying angel in the land and how
[2:12:46] it's destroying everything. that there's
[2:12:48] a mighty angel and it's descended and
[2:12:51] beautiful masterpiece.
[2:12:53] Poured his heart out to preach it and a
[2:12:55] young man come up for prayer and I don't
[2:12:58] know what he wanted. Brother Windle, he
[2:13:00] was praying for him and talking to him
[2:13:02] and he was just standing there looking
[2:13:03] ahead and then brother Windle said these
[2:13:06] words. He said, "He don't understand me.
[2:13:09] He don't understand me."
[2:13:12] And it dawned on me there was a language
[2:13:14] barrier. Brother Wendle, you were
[2:13:17] pouring your heart out,
[2:13:19] but he didn't understand
[2:13:21] you. It was a moment, Brother Diego. It
[2:13:24] was a moment and something spoke to my
[2:13:27] heart. And I grabbed Brother Diego and I
[2:13:29] said, "I
[2:13:30] interpret." And he walked right up there
[2:13:32] and he got in front of him and he
[2:13:34] started saying what was happening. And
[2:13:35] all of a sudden, Brother Jonathan, I
[2:13:37] watched the effect of understanding come
[2:13:40] upon him. You say, "Preacher, why did
[2:13:42] that move you so much?" because I was
[2:13:45] that boy
[2:13:47] and window was my Bible. No, you know
[2:13:49] what I'm saying? And I was reading it
[2:13:51] and I was reading about these beasts and
[2:13:53] I was reading about all these things. I
[2:13:55] was reading about the seals and I was
[2:13:57] reading about baptism and serpency. I
[2:13:59] was reading all these things, brother
[2:14:00] Sean, and nothing was moving me. Not
[2:14:03] because I didn't believe it. I couldn't
[2:14:05] understand it. But God, who is rich in
[2:14:08] mercy, went and got me an interpreter.
[2:14:12] He went and got me a prophet. He went
[2:14:14] and got me a prophet and he led him to
[2:14:16] where I was and I be to read my Bible
[2:14:19] and he be to break it down. Thank you.
[2:14:21] He be to tell me you was in the mind of
[2:14:23] God from before the foundation of the
[2:14:25] world. He be to tell me that he loved
[2:14:27] me. He began to tell me that he was for
[2:14:30] me. He be to reveal to me that I had a
[2:14:32] future. And he went over in the book of
[2:14:34] Revelation and he said, "You're not just
[2:14:35] a piece of Tennessee country boy dirt.
[2:14:38] You're a prophetic young man." But then
[2:14:40] he led me to the book of Peter and he
[2:14:41] said there's a prophetic grace and here
[2:14:43] I am today. You know why I'm shouting?
[2:14:46] You know why I'll die?
[2:14:48] Probably I will not lay down. I'll die
[2:14:50] for this message. You know why? Because
[2:14:53] I didn't understand
[2:14:55] it. But God rich in mercy, give me a
[2:14:58] prophet who introduced me to another
[2:15:06] sense. And I can shout today cuz I ain't
[2:15:09] going to Rome. I'm going to the meeting
[2:15:12] in the
[2:15:14] air. I can shout today cuz I ain't going
[2:15:17] to go kiss a dead man's ring. I'm going
[2:15:19] to go kiss my Lord who's alive and he's
[2:15:22] well. I'm not
[2:15:25] [Applause]
[2:15:27] I'm not shout I'm not crying and pouting
[2:15:30] today because the world's falling apart.
[2:15:32] I'm shouting because I seen a new
[2:15:35] [Applause]
[2:15:38] Jerusalem coming down from God out of
[2:15:43] heaven. You say, "Preacher, you're
[2:15:46] pretty bold on this." I am very bolder.
[2:15:49] I stand by that picture. I've taken
[2:15:52] beatings for that picture. I've been
[2:15:54] criticized for that picture, but I'll
[2:15:56] never quit preaching it
[2:16:01] because Billy Graham bowed bowed right
[2:16:03] down there. Whether he went physically
[2:16:05] or not, he said that w that that beast
[2:16:08] system was wonderful.
[2:16:11] Pentecostal leaders stood there.
[2:16:13] Pentecostal leaders stood there.
[2:16:16] Pentecostal leaders, yes, sir, stood
[2:16:18] there and said, "This is spiritual. It's
[2:16:22] glory. It's uniting. Yes, sir.
[2:16:26] You know why the devil hates that
[2:16:27] picture? Cuz there was one guy he
[2:16:29] couldn't get over there.
[2:16:31] [Applause]
[2:16:35] He got the rest of them, brother Daryl.
[2:16:36] But there was one he couldn't get. You
[2:16:39] know why? Because he had a
[2:16:41] forecast. He had a vision. You know why?
[2:16:44] I was a part of it. I will never bow and
[2:16:48] worship that. You know what he said? He
[2:16:50] said, "I was on my way down there. I had
[2:16:52] an interview with the pope. He said, "I
[2:16:54] was going to go in there." They said,
[2:16:55] "Take your hat off, whatever." He said,
[2:16:56] "But then they said to me, Brother Tim,"
[2:16:58] they said, "When you walk in there,"
[2:17:00] they said, "bow down and kiss his ring."
[2:17:03] He said, "Oh, deals off. Oh, deals off."
[2:17:07] He said, "No, I won't do that." He said,
[2:17:09] "Because that's worship." And he said,
[2:17:11] "The only one that deserves worship is
[2:17:13] the Lord Jesus Christ." He said, "I'll
[2:17:16] give him respect, but I'll not give him
[2:17:18] worship." You know why?
[2:17:21] Because the Bible said they're dead
[2:17:22] while yet
[2:17:23] living. He was not going in there
[2:17:26] underneath a living conqueror and
[2:17:28] kissing a dead corpse's
[2:17:31] ring. I'm going to say this and I'm
[2:17:33] done. He said deals off the table and he
[2:17:36] come there in 1963 and he opened the
[2:17:39] second seal and he read the mark of the
[2:17:41] beast and he talked about the seal of
[2:17:43] God and he said here's what the devil
[2:17:45] hates is the whole world will bow and
[2:17:48] will worship that man. We'll follow that
[2:17:50] beast.
[2:17:56] Except Woo.
[2:17:59] Except Except those who've got another
[2:18:02] sense. Except those who's heard from
[2:18:05] their theophony. Except those that have
[2:18:08] changed and mentions by the preaching of
[2:18:10] the gospel. Can I say this? Come on,
[2:18:12] musicians. Except those whose names are
[2:18:15] recorded in the Lamb's Book of Life,
[2:18:18] they will never fall down to the beast.
[2:18:20] They'll worship the lamb of God. And the
[2:18:22] lamb of God is not William Brandham.
[2:18:24] It's the Lord Jesus Christ. Stand on
[2:18:27] your feet and hail a
[2:18:29] conqueror. Praise the living God. Praise
[2:18:33] the power of God. Thank him for the
[2:18:35] grace of
[2:18:38] God. The whole world wondered
[2:18:44] The whole world wondered after this
[2:18:46] beast.
[2:18:48] They all bowed
[2:18:51] down and they all
[2:18:54] said, "This is
[2:18:56] wonderful. This is
[2:19:00] spiritual. I ain't got time to preach
[2:19:02] another sermon, but I sure want to.
[2:19:05] I really do." Sister Faith,
[2:19:08] I want to stop right now, Brother Joe,
[2:19:09] and preach a sermon on little David.
[2:19:13] You know why? Cuz little David was
[2:19:15] between the Catholic Church and the
[2:19:16] Protestant church.
[2:19:19] He was between Saul's army and the
[2:19:21] Philistines and they were encroaching on
[2:19:23] him and they were trying to destroy him.
[2:19:24] Brother said he was a man without a
[2:19:26] nation. Kind of like us. He was a man
[2:19:30] without a nation. Who said y'all could
[2:19:31] have that tent meeting?
[2:19:33] [Music]
[2:19:36] God did.
[2:19:41] Brother Ronnie, God
[2:19:43] did man without a nation. Now, you know
[2:19:46] what they said? They said, "You're a
[2:19:48] rebellious child." You know what brother
[2:19:50] said? He said, "Problem was the
[2:19:52] anointing was already on David."
[2:19:56] Oh, that's why the devil hates you,
[2:19:57] brothers. You men of God preaching this
[2:20:00] message.
[2:20:03] Yeah. Cuz he wouldn't bow.
[2:20:07] He said, "The sword's in your hand."
[2:20:13] Amen.
[2:20:16] I realize it. I realize I realize that
[2:20:19] people, precious people, precious
[2:20:23] people,
[2:20:25] bound by denominational feelings and
[2:20:28] religions and
[2:20:32] traditions. But can I leave you with
[2:20:33] this?
[2:20:37] The word
[2:20:39] interpretation means
[2:20:42] loosening. You know that when something
[2:20:45] is
[2:20:46] interpreted, it's
[2:20:49] loosed. Y'all Y'all remember them days
[2:20:51] you was tied up? Remember those days you
[2:20:54] was tied up? Now, I I'll say this. I've
[2:20:58] got the quoted scriptures on all those
[2:21:00] pictures. If you want them, I can give
[2:21:01] them to you. I didn't have time to read
[2:21:02] them. I just want to clarify that I'm
[2:21:04] not just making these things up. They're
[2:21:07] in the
[2:21:08] message. But can I say something to
[2:21:11] you? You were like that little donkey
[2:21:14] tied up. I think uh Brother Daniel
[2:21:16] Landes, I think you told that years ago,
[2:21:18] that little donkey tied up. One day they
[2:21:21] untied him and he rode into town. And
[2:21:24] when he rode into town, they were
[2:21:25] screaming,
[2:21:26] "Hosana! Hosanna! Hallelujah! Hosanna!"
[2:21:31] He said, "Then the next day that little
[2:21:33] donkey was over there and he was kind of
[2:21:35] discouraged." And they asked him, they
[2:21:37] said, "Why are you so
[2:21:39] discouraged?" He said, "Well,
[2:21:40] yesterday," he said, "I was riding
[2:21:42] through town. Everybody was saying,
[2:21:43] "Hosana, hosana, hosana." He said,
[2:21:47] "Today." And they're just looking at me.
[2:21:49] It's like I don't even exist. And that
[2:21:52] other donkey spoke up. You know what he
[2:21:53] said? He said, "Oh, it's cuz yesterday
[2:21:56] the anointed word was on you.
[2:21:59] [Music]
[2:22:03] Yesterday prophecy fulfilled was on you.
[2:22:06] Yesterday manifested word was upon
[2:22:14] you. When you lay this message aside,
[2:22:17] it's over,
[2:22:18] [Music]
[2:22:19] folks. It's over. You have no standards
[2:22:22] to judge anything by. You have no vision
[2:22:25] to preach to the people. You have no
[2:22:26] ability to withstand spirits. But I
[2:22:29] wonder on the final service, brother
[2:22:31] Sean, I thank you for this opportunity
[2:22:32] to stand here and preach this today. And
[2:22:35] in my heart told the Lord in prayer, if
[2:22:38] I don't do anything, I'm going to do
[2:22:39] this. I'm going to put a strong plug in
[2:22:41] for this
[2:22:44] message. Get behind
[2:22:47] it. Get out of this wicked
[2:22:50] system. Witness to him. You really want
[2:22:53] to witness to him, hand them a book.
[2:22:58] Well, I'm trying to help him. You ain't
[2:23:00] helping them by eating at the same table
[2:23:01] of omit with them. Hand them some truth.
[2:23:04] Tell them God sent a prophet. Tell them
[2:23:06] God has revealed the book of Revelation
[2:23:08] and
[2:23:09] [Music]
[2:23:10] symbols. Young men, you want to do
[2:23:12] something for God? Go tell somebody God
[2:23:14] sent a message. Be the greatest thing
[2:23:17] you ever told
[2:23:18] them. How many can raise your hands
[2:23:20] today and say, "Lord, thank you.
[2:23:25] Thank you for this
[2:23:26] vision. Thank you for this
[2:23:29] forecast. If it wasn't for this vision,
[2:23:32] if it wasn't for this
[2:23:37] forecast, I want you right
[2:23:40] now, I'm going to prove something by the
[2:23:42] power of the Holy Spirit. Right now, not
[2:23:44] me, the word. I want everybody to put
[2:23:46] your hands down.
[2:23:48] Every person in here that's been
[2:23:49] delivered from that Roman Catholicism
[2:23:51] spirit, I want you to raise your hands
[2:23:52] very high that come out of the Roman
[2:23:55] Catholic Church. You come out of the
[2:23:56] Roman Catholic Church. Can you raise
[2:23:58] your hands high for me? You come out of
[2:24:00] the Roman Catholic Church. There's God
[2:24:02] bless you, sis. Our brother there,
[2:24:04] brother Diego, his dad, his brother.
[2:24:07] Brother Diego is what I said the truth
[2:24:09] about
[2:24:10] that. You experienced that spirit. No
[2:24:13] power to withstand it. And you'll tell
[2:24:16] everybody, too. If it wasn't for this
[2:24:17] message, you'd be right
[2:24:20] there. Brother, you couldn't
[2:24:23] dance. You say, "Ain't nobody shouting."
[2:24:25] I ain't trying to get you to shout right
[2:24:26] now. I'm trying to get you to see God
[2:24:27] sent a message. You wouldn't be dancing
[2:24:30] like you were all weekend under that
[2:24:31] nonsense. But under that living power
[2:24:33] right there, under the pillar of fire,
[2:24:35] he can heal your foot and you can dance
[2:24:37] all over that
[2:24:40] thing. Now, how many was delivered from
[2:24:42] denominations?
[2:24:44] Same
[2:24:46] thing. Same thing. Different title. Same
[2:24:51] thing. Now, how many is going to see
[2:24:57] daddy? Almighty God, we bow our hearts
[2:25:00] in your presence this
[2:25:01] morning. Father, we don't know if this
[2:25:04] will be the next pope of America or not.
[2:25:06] We're not standing here saying it is.
[2:25:08] But Lord, I have read enough books and
[2:25:10] listened to enough tapes to know your
[2:25:13] prophet has told us they're milepost.
[2:25:15] And Lord, when things take place, it's
[2:25:18] not time to act ignorant. It's not time
[2:25:20] to back up on our convictions to preach
[2:25:22] these things. Now, Father, I realize the
[2:25:24] world we're living in is swallowed up by
[2:25:26] this beast. Lord, time would fail every
[2:25:28] one of us, men of God, to stand here and
[2:25:30] each one of us take a sermon breaking
[2:25:32] these things down. Lord, we can never
[2:25:35] cover it all. It's a wicked. It's a It's
[2:25:37] a beast. It's a spirit. It's a It's a
[2:25:40] bondage. It's a It's a
[2:25:42] prison. But Lord, I'm so thankful.
[2:25:45] Hallelujah. I'm so thankful to be called
[2:25:48] out under this message. Lord, I'm so
[2:25:50] thankful for prophetic communication.
[2:25:53] Lord, I'm so thankful for oracles of God
[2:25:55] that I can feed upon. Lord, I'm so
[2:25:57] thankful I can stand here this morning
[2:26:00] by the grace of God and tell these
[2:26:02] people good news. Lord, not bad news.
[2:26:06] Lord, good news. Father, the world's
[2:26:09] falling apart, but the bride's going up.
[2:26:13] Now, Lord, I pray this morning, Father,
[2:26:15] from the very first night you spoke
[2:26:17] through our men of your man of God, our
[2:26:19] brother Daryl, through waring and
[2:26:21] following it up, Lord, through the
[2:26:22] healer and the believer, the Pharisee,
[2:26:24] follow it up through the power of God.
[2:26:26] the next morning on the on the word of
[2:26:28] his power and last night on the capstone
[2:26:30] in grace. Father, to stand here this
[2:26:32] morning and to say to these people, you
[2:26:34] got a future and it's not in a Roman
[2:26:37] Catholic system. It's not in a
[2:26:39] confederation of churches, stay
[2:26:41] underneath the voice of the seventh
[2:26:43] angel. Study what a prophet said to
[2:26:46] admonish the men of God to preach it
[2:26:48] like never before. Father to encourage
[2:26:51] the families and homes to make a stand.
[2:26:53] Lord, the whole world is bowing and
[2:26:57] giving into it. But Lord, I thank you
[2:26:59] for my prophet. Lord, I don't worship
[2:27:02] him, but I thank you for him. I thank
[2:27:04] you for the grace and the strength of
[2:27:05] the headstone that you prophesied would
[2:27:08] flow through the body. It flew it. It
[2:27:10] flowed through him one day and he said,
[2:27:12] "I'm not going over there and kissing
[2:27:13] his ring. I'm not going over there and
[2:27:15] bowing down. I've got to stand against
[2:27:17] that because I got to tell people
[2:27:19] they're not going to do it either, Lord.
[2:27:21] Now, Father, I pray a blessing upon this
[2:27:23] people. Lord, if there's been a
[2:27:25] denominational spirit influence creep in
[2:27:27] a home or life here, God, you know my
[2:27:29] heart. I'm not after anyone. I'm after a
[2:27:32] spirit this morning that will try to
[2:27:34] dilute this word in this message and
[2:27:36] reduce it down to just Brother
[2:27:37] Brandham's quotes or just a bunch of
[2:27:39] preachers. Father, it's the sword of the
[2:27:43] spirit to withstand the most powerful
[2:27:45] force of wickedness on the earth.
[2:27:48] Father, strengthen your children.
[2:27:50] Strengthen them this morning. Strengthen
[2:27:53] our young people, Lord. Father, if the
[2:27:55] convictions are fallen, Lord, may the
[2:27:58] may the may the scream of the eagle come
[2:28:00] in their heart this morning and shock
[2:28:02] them, Lord, to realize it's not just a
[2:28:05] sermon, it's prophecy, and they're in
[2:28:08] it. May the standard be raised that when
[2:28:12] the enemy comes in like a flood, God
[2:28:14] will raise up a standard against you.
[2:28:16] Lord, I thank you for this meeting. I
[2:28:18] thank you for Brother Sean. I thank you
[2:28:20] for this assembly. Lord, I thank you for
[2:28:22] every man of God that stood here in
[2:28:23] labor this week. Father, I pray that
[2:28:26] every believer that gets in their cars
[2:28:27] today and makes their journey home, I
[2:28:30] pray, Lord, they come under one sense,
[2:28:32] but Lord, I pray they leave here under
[2:28:34] another sense. I pray they leave here so
[2:28:37] in love with this message. I pray Lord
[2:28:39] these men of God have so so wet their
[2:28:41] appetite by these quotes and scriptures
[2:28:43] that they can't wait to get home and
[2:28:45] feed on the holy oracles of God to feed
[2:28:48] that super sense they're leaving under
[2:28:50] Lord. Father I pray for the assembly
[2:28:53] here that's poured out and poured out
[2:28:54] and poured out and poured out for these
[2:28:56] meetings. Father I pray today Lord you
[2:28:58] open the windows of heaven and pour a
[2:29:00] blessing out upon them. Now Lord you
[2:29:02] know my heart. I didn't deliver these
[2:29:04] things to be prejudice or to be hard.
[2:29:07] But Lord, your prophet said, "Deliver
[2:29:09] the holy oracles of God, not
[2:29:11] overbearing, but in wisdom." Lord,
[2:29:14] manifest yourself. Bless your children.
[2:29:18] And Father, may they lift this these
[2:29:21] this picture of your pillar of fire back
[2:29:22] up. Lord, if the enemy's come in and put
[2:29:25] a damper in their heart about it and
[2:29:27] they've removed it from their homes or
[2:29:29] maybe questioning it because someone's
[2:29:31] told them it's idolatry. Lord, when I
[2:29:33] look at those pictures of men bound by a
[2:29:35] corpse, I could care less what they got
[2:29:37] to say about me looking at the living
[2:29:38] pillar of fire that was photographed in
[2:29:40] my
[2:29:42] generation. I thank you, Father, and I
[2:29:45] love you with all my heart. And I love
[2:29:47] your people. Now, may God you bless them
[2:29:50] richly in Jesus name I pray. May
[2:29:53] revelation come upon revelation in Jesus
[2:29:56] name I pray. Amen and amen. Brother
[2:30:01] Sean, would you come? I love you this
[2:30:04] morning with the love of the Lord. God
[2:30:06] bless you. God bless
[2:30:09] you. This message is the
[2:30:12] truth. It's the
[2:30:14] truth. And I'll see you at the house.
[2:30:17] It's the truth. We're going home on it.
[2:30:21] We're going to ride out of here. here.
[2:30:22] One of these mornings, if I never see
[2:30:24] you down here again, we'll see you over
[2:30:27] there, brother. The window will shout
[2:30:29] down the streets of gold. We'll talk
[2:30:31] about the battles we fought together and
[2:30:33] we
[2:30:35] overcome. Going home, Brother Tim.
[2:30:38] Hallelujah. Brother Ronnie, I'll see you
[2:30:40] at the house. We're going to go home one
[2:30:42] day, buddy. And we're going to shout and
[2:30:43] we're going to enjoy these
[2:30:45] things. It's real and it's the truth.
[2:30:49] God bless you.
[2:30:51] [Music]
[2:30:57] We bow
[2:30:58] down and lay our
[2:31:01] crowns at the
[2:31:04] feet of
[2:31:07] Jesus. The greatness
[2:31:10] of his mercy and
[2:31:13] love at the
[2:31:16] feet of
[2:31:18] Jesus. You cry holy holy holy. Can you
[2:31:24] lift your hands and just worship him?

[2:32:05] change is through my body. And we'll cry
[2:32:11] holy,
[2:32:12] holy,
[2:32:14] holy. We'll cry holy,

[2:32:41] this age. And men of God uh proclaiming

[2:48:26] love and your mercy that you've shown
[2:48:28] unto us this weekend and this week,
[2:48:31] Lord, time and time again, just speaking
[2:48:33] to our hearts, Lord. And Lord, we just
[2:48:36] want to tell you thank you. Thank you
[2:48:39] for the faith deposit into our hearts
[2:48:41] that we could believe the word that
[2:48:42] we've heard. And Lord, you wrote our
[2:48:45] name on the lamb's book of life before
[2:48:46] the foundation of the world. that Lord,
[2:48:49] no matter what the trials and situations
[2:48:51] we go through and maybe the
[2:48:53] discouragement comes, Lord, but we've
[2:48:54] we've heard a word, Lord, that we know
[2:48:56] we can't miss it, Lord, that one of
[2:48:58] these glorious mornings, Lord, we're
[2:49:00] going to be transformed in a twinkling
[2:49:01] of an eye to be together with you for
[2:49:04] eternity. And Lord, until that time, may
[2:49:07] you go with each one of these believers
[2:49:09] that have gathered together back to
[2:49:11] their homes and their churches. Lord,
[2:49:12] may they just continue to feed on this
[2:49:15] word and continue to grow day by day
[2:49:17] until that catching away. Lord, we just
[2:49:20] ask that you would just restore back
[2:49:22] abundantly to these men of God who
[2:49:24] poured out their hearts over this week,
[2:49:26] Lord, who labored for your kingdom and
[2:49:28] and Lord, uh people don't know the
[2:49:30] sacrifice and and and and how they labor
[2:49:34] just to find your mind and even, Lord,
[2:49:36] how you bring them through trials and
[2:49:39] situations, Lord, throughout lives and
[2:49:41] years just to bring one sermon that
[2:49:43] could be a blessing to somebody, Lord.
[2:49:45] So, we pray that you just be their
[2:49:46] portion, Lord. Lord, we ask your
[2:49:48] blessings upon the food and Lord, our
[2:49:50] time of fellowship. Go with each one
[2:49:52] now. We pray, Father. Also, we just ask
[2:49:54] a special blessing upon Brother Shawn
[2:49:56] and his family and Faith Tabernacle for
[2:49:58] all that they've done. Lord, we know
[2:50:00] that their reward is in heaven. We thank
[2:50:03] you for him and ask these blessings in
[2:50:05] Jesus Christ's name.
[2:50:09] Amen. God bless you,
[2:50:11] saints. Amen. Then you go and live here.
[2:50:14] Our
[2:50:16] blessed
[2:50:18] Savior will live and reign
[2:50:23] forever. I'll see you in the
[2:50:28] rapture some sweet
