[36:55] this end that men ought always to pray
[36:58] and and and not and not to faint saying
[37:02] there was in a city a judge which feared
[37:04] not God neither regarded man and there
[37:07] was a widow in that City and she came
[37:08] unto him saying avenge me of mine
[37:10] adversary and he would not and he would
[37:13] not for a while but afterwards he said
[37:16] he he said within himself though I fear
[37:18] not God nor nor nor regard men yet
[37:23] because this Widow troubleth me I will
[37:25] avenge her Les lest by her continual
[37:27] coming she worry
[37:30] me um and and the Lord said hear what
[37:33] the unjust judge saith and a and shall
[37:37] not God avenge his own his own elect
[37:39] which CED day and night un unto him
[37:41] though he bear long with them and I tell

[38:20] amen amen y'all can have your seats I uh
[38:25] um wanted to speak just just for just a
[38:27] a little bit on the subject of
[38:30] perseverance um um when I looked up the
[38:33] word and the Very word perseverance
[38:35] means a continued effort to do or
[38:37] achieve something despite difficulties
[38:40] failures or opposition persisting
[38:42] steadfastly without without giving up
[38:45] continuing in spite of difficulties or
[38:48] setbacks amen
[38:50] persevering hey um but uh um um um we we
[38:55] we and we can look in the Bible and
[38:58] brother BR has preached on this subject
[38:59] many many times actually um but but we
[39:03] can we can look in the Bible of of many
[39:05] examples of men and women in the Bible
[39:08] who have persevered though though Satan
[39:10] came came against them in in many
[39:12] different ways but yet but yet these but
[39:14] yet these these these men and women of
[39:16] God they stood fast on God's word and
[39:19] and and they pressed through whatever
[39:20] trial of whatever trial came their way
[39:23] amen and and and if you can you can
[39:27] you can look at Moses when for when when
[39:30] when when when when um when be before
[39:35] before he he he he he went to the
[39:37] backside of the desert he he ran away
[39:40] away from from the opposition because he
[39:41] was scared but yet after he had that

[43:01] him amen amen um brother random says it
[43:04] say say says says it says that a winner
[43:07] never quits and a quitter never wins
[43:09] just think of it a winner never quits
[43:10] and a quitter never wins you must hold
[43:12] on and before you even start be dead
[43:15] sure you're right and then and then be
[43:18] and then be persistent let nothing let

[43:51] realize that that that that even though
[43:53] the world around us can't see
[43:55] it can't see it and yet when all hell is
[43:57] breaking against us we can stand
[43:59] confident in our calling and confident
[44:01] in who we are as the bride of Christ
[44:03] Christ and we can stand stand firm in
[44:05] faith faith and even though our natural
[44:07] lie can't see it

[44:14] can see it because because because
[44:16] because it's it's who we are it's in our
[44:18] DNA but but but but but and brother
[44:22] brand said the first thing you have to
[44:24] do if you're going to find Christ you've
[44:26] got to know that you've got a need of
[44:27] him and when you think that you just
[44:29] don't then you just don't need him then
[44:31] you'll never find him cuz you won't
[44:33] search him out diligently he he he said
[44:35] he he said he you notice the scripture
[44:37] where seek and he shall find knock and
[44:39] it shall be open he said actually that's

[45:25] and and every person that starts out to
[45:26] beat Christ will find you have got a lot
[45:29] of of of hindrances but your faith won't

[45:34] hindrances faith has got hairs on its
[45:37] chest and great big muscles reasons will
[45:39] raise up and said and said you know it's
[45:41] reasonable and Faith pulls his muscles
[45:43] back and sticks his big chest out and
[45:44] says shut up and sit down and reads and
[45:47] jumps over in the corner and takes a
[45:48] stool right faith has got muscles and he
[45:51] means what he says and that's what what
[45:53] we need what we need what we need need

[46:15] perseverance but but but but but but

[47:04] has already has already promised it
[47:06] brother random said said said that that
[47:09] that that he can do nothing else than
[47:11] what he has already done and what he has

[47:16] stand there knowing that God will
[47:18] fulfill what he what what with what with
[47:21] whatsoever he he has promised why you

[47:30] you can be you can be per per persistent
[47:33] at it at and shemi Beth is a perfect is
[47:37] a perfect example of that after 20 years
[47:39] of being persistent since I moved here
[47:41] I'll get I I I I I I'll say this when I
[47:45] used when I used to work with shamay and
[47:47] them a lot he would tell me every day
[47:48] God has not given me my baby yet he said
[47:51] but it is in the making and that man has
[47:53] stood there in confidence and knowing in
[47:55] the promises of what God has has
[47:56] promised him he has stood there in
[47:58] confidence knowing that God will fulfill
[48:00] it why and I and and I personally I've
[48:04] been promised to me the healing of my
[48:06] stuttering and I know for sure God one
[48:08] day soon will will completely will he he
[48:10] he he he will completely heal me of it
[48:13] why because I can stand here in
[48:14] confidence and all Assurance knowing
[48:16] that that whatsoever God has promised he
[48:19] will fulfill it why because we know that
[48:21] Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today
[48:24] a and and forever why if he's the same
[48:26] then if if he done it in the past he has
[48:28] to do it again today Satan is fighting
[48:31] us with everything that that that that
[48:33] that with everything that that that with
[48:36] everything that he's got got right now
[48:38] he's hitting us with with sickness with
[48:40] vehicle problems with with with with
[48:42] with with bills and with with mind
[48:44] battles and depressions and all this
[48:46] stuff but yet we as the bride of Christ
[48:48] we can stand confident in what God has
[48:51] has has called us not not wavering left
[48:54] or right we can stand persistent in what
[48:56] God has has given us which is which is
[48:58] the the the word of God in the message
[49:00] of the hour we've had people come in
[49:02] this message and we've had them leave
[49:03] they've they they've showed up and and
[49:05] they made a great name a great name a
[49:06] great name name name name name a great
[49:10] name for themselves but we notice as
[49:11] soon as they as as they go off as they
[49:13] got off the word they fell they fell by
[49:14] the
[49:15] wayside it is it is and it is it is in
[49:18] inevitable as the bride of Christ we
[49:20] will come across discouragements we'll
[49:22] come across obstacles we we will come
[49:25] across Boulders in the road will come
[49:27] across our trials and and and and and
[49:30] and our our our tribulations but but but
[49:33] but but but yet but yet we can we we can
[49:35] March forward and stand on the word of
[49:37] God and be persistent at it at it we
[49:39] will see that thing that we've been
[49:40] praying for come to pass when when we're
[49:43] on the mountain top it's easy to stay
[49:45] strong but but but but it it's when
[49:48] you're in the valley is is is when the
[49:50] Trials
[49:52] come if you look at the law contrast
[49:54] that that and brother random has taught
[49:56] has taught it many times but but but you
[49:58] would never know how to appreciate the
[49:59] daytime if you never had a night and and
[50:01] you never know how how to appreciate the
[50:03] sunshine if if you didn't have a cloudy
[50:04] day you would never know H H how how how
[50:08] how how how to to to to appreciate the
[50:11] righteousness unless you had unless you
[50:13] had had had some
[50:17] unrighteousness you you would never know
[50:19] no no no how how to to appreciate Health
[50:25] unless un unless you you've you've
[50:28] you've had some sicknesses you've had
[50:30] got your good health and you got your
[50:31] bad Health you you got your good days
[50:33] and you got your bad days and and and
[50:35] you look at um just drinking good water
[50:38] versus bad water I've been hun hunting
[50:40] hun hunting in the mountains out before
[50:42] and I ran out of water and I found a mud
[50:44] hole and I was so thirsty I drank it I
[50:46] didn't die but it was so nasty but to me
[50:49] then I I I was so appreciative of that
[50:51] water cuz I thought I was going to die
[50:53] out there but when I got back when I got
[50:54] back to the car I had gallons of fresh
[50:56] FR water in the back of my truck and I
[50:58] have never been more appreciative of of
[51:01] of of Walmart water in all my life as as
[51:03] to when I got back to that truck why
[51:05] because because I seen the law the law
[51:06] of contrast before it was just it's just
[51:08] water but but but yet when I got
[51:10] desperate when I no longer had had had
[51:12] that thing that I took common it became
[51:15] it became lifegiving to me it became it
[51:17] became precious precious to
[51:21] me but but but that's why that's why we
[51:24] as the bride we we can appreciate the
[51:26] whole holy spirit so much tonight is
[51:28] because is because we can step back and
[51:30] we can look at all the denominational
[51:32] churches churches and they're up and
[51:34] they're down and they're and they're
[51:35] this and they're that and and all they
[51:38] do is they live off of motions or if
[51:39] you're a Baptist you you live off of off
[51:41] of the letter of the law and most of
[51:43] them are are off that but but but yet
[51:45] but yet we as the bride we can stand we
[51:47] can look back at it and we can be so
[51:49] appreciative of the Holy Ghost living
[51:51] and indwelling in our lives we can be so
[51:53] appreciative of the message of the hour
[51:54] tonight why because we have seen what
[51:57] what the what the world what the world
[51:58] will will will will will will or what
[52:01] the world has has has has produced but
[52:05] we can stand and be and be and be
[52:06] thankful for for what God has has H has
[52:10] has has produced has produced in the
[52:13] message of the
[52:14] hour why because it's the law of
[52:17] contrast job if you look at job you can
[52:20] see he he he was a he was a perfect man
[52:22] in every way he he he he he was upright
[52:26] and he was right righteous but but but
[52:27] yet but yet but yet but yet God said or
[52:32] but God said Satan have you considered
[52:33] my servant job and and and and and he
[52:37] said and he said I can't because because
[52:39] because because because because you have
[52:41] a hedge around but so God let that that
[52:43] let that let that let that head hedge
[52:45] down next thing you know his children
[52:47] have died his servants have died his
[52:49] wealth was gone his his flocks his
[52:52] flocks of the sheep and herds and his
[52:54] herds and his cattle were gone his
[52:56] friends were mocking him his wife his
[52:58] wife finally looked at him and said just
[52:59] curse God and die but but but he looked
[53:02] at her and he stood there and all
[53:04] confidence knowing knowing knowing who
[53:06] he was and and that and that he was a
[53:10] Son of God and he said the lord giveth
[53:12] and the lord taketh blessed be the name
[53:14] of the Lord why he was persistent in his
[53:16] calling and he knew that that that that
[53:19] that he had not transgress the Lord and
[53:21] he knew that there was no reason why why
[53:24] why why why why he he he was going he
[53:29] that know the reason why he was going
[53:31] through those battles so he could stand
[53:33] confident in his calling knowing that
[53:35] that God was
[53:37] faithful and and and and just cuz why
[53:40] it's blessed be the name of the Lord so
[53:43] so so when we are on our mountain top
[53:45] and everything is going well and our our
[53:46] health is good and our bills are paid
[53:48] and and and and and the kids are getting
[53:51] along great and spiritually it seems
[53:53] like the Devils can't seem to touch us
[53:56] but but but but but but yet we no we
[53:57] don't have to fight as easy it's much
[54:00] easier to to um to to to to stay to to
[54:04] to to to stay stay strong because
[54:09] because because because we have we
[54:10] haven't gone through the trials and the
[54:11] tribulations we're coasting on the
[54:13] mountain top but in Luke chapter 16 and
[54:16] and the 16th verse it says the law and
[54:18] the prophets were until John and since
[54:20] that time the kingdom of God is preached
[54:22] and every man presses in into it every
[54:25] man presses
[54:28] into it not we don't just simply walk
[54:30] into it easily but it's got to be
[54:33] pressed into it you see so the Bible
[54:36] says when you seek me with all your
[54:38] heart then then then then you shall find
[54:42] so so when we are in the valley that's
[54:44] when our character is molded that's
[54:46] that's that that's when that's when
[54:49] that's when we're shaped and that's when
[54:50] and that's when we're like that diamond
[54:52] who through all that all that pressure
[54:54] and that heat and everything else it it
[54:56] it it it it it comes forth as a
[54:58] diamond if that diamond was was to give
[55:01] away at any time it would be nothing but
[55:03] a worthless chunk of cold cold but yet
[55:05] be yet that diamond has endured it it's
[55:09] it's come through the trials and the
[55:11] tribulation and it has come forth as as
[55:13] one of the most rare substance on on the
[55:15] face of the Earth and if you look at if
[55:18] you look at gold that gold is it has in
[55:21] order in in order for for it to be
[55:23] purified it has to be beat and beat and
[55:25] beat until all that dross and all the
[55:28] all the bad stuff is is is drawn out of
[55:30] it to where nothing but you reflect the
[55:32] character of him or or you reflect the
[55:34] image of him of him of him that that
[55:37] that is beating on you brother brother
[55:41] Bram said unless we suffer with him we
[55:43] cannot Reign we cannot Reign reign with
[55:46] him you have to suffer to rain the
[55:48] reason for it is this is the character
[55:50] simply is never made without suffering
[55:52] character is a victory not a gift a man
[55:55] cannot without character cannot Reign
[55:57] because power apart from character is
[55:59] satanic but Power with character is fit
[56:01] to rule and since he wants us to share
[56:04] even his throne on the same basis that
[56:05] he overcame and has sat down in his
[56:07] father's Throne then we have to overcome
[56:10] and sit with him and all the little
[56:12] temporary temporary suffering that we go
[56:14] through now is not worthy is not worthy
[56:18] to to be compared to be compared to the
[56:21] tremendous Glory that will be revealed
[56:22] in us when he comes oh what Treasures
[56:25] are laid up for those who are willing to
[56:26] enter into his kingdom through much
[56:29] tribulation
[56:31] so so so so now we we we can see that
[56:35] that that that that that that that it's
[56:37] in The Valleys is when our has when our
[56:39] character is formed and through that
[56:41] trial and those tribulations where where
[56:45] that's that's what's molding us and
[56:46] shaping us and it's it's turning us into
[56:49] his image and in his likeness and in his
[56:51] glory this is where God's Warriors are
[56:53] separated from the make Believers this
[56:55] is this is this is where this is where
[56:57] God has called us has called us to to to
[57:00] take up that that Armor of God and to
[57:02] stand strong and fight and fight and and
[57:04] fight for what we've got to to to to
[57:07] fight for our children to to to to to to
[57:09] fight for our God GI given given given
[57:12] given in in in
[57:14] inheritance if you have need of healing
[57:16] tonight you can stand strong on God's
[57:20] word and you can fight for it why you
[57:22] you you can be persevering perseverant
[57:24] Tonight Tonight T not not to give up if
[57:28] it doesn't happen with the first couple
[57:29] minutes not to give up if if it doesn't
[57:31] happen with the first hour but yet you
[57:33] can stand there and if it takes years
[57:34] and years and years you can stand there

[1:02:45] to see for a man that he could put
[1:02:48] confidence in that he would that he
[1:02:50] would believe him regardless of
[1:02:51] circumstances he found he he found
[1:02:54] Abraham and called Abraham by elction
[1:02:56] and and it said and God called Abraham
[1:02:58] just because he was a man that that that
[1:03:01] God called Abraham just because he was a
[1:03:03] man that he could trust and he believed
[1:03:05] him and he put confidence in him and he
[1:03:07] told him that at the age of 75 he was
[1:03:09] married to his Half Sister Sarah and she
[1:03:11] was 65 he said there's 10 years of
[1:03:13] difference but God told Abraham that he
[1:03:15] was going to make him a father of

[1:03:46] that he's putting in it is time tested
[1:03:49] material you might come to to to the
[1:03:52] Altar and make a confession but when he
[1:03:54] finds blow holes and everything else
[1:03:57] into where the world's where the world's
[1:03:59] blown the maggots in you and so forth
[1:04:01] you cannot stand he just pitches you you
[1:04:04] you to one side God wants a times tested
[1:04:06] church not somebody who's a Christian

[1:04:38] you he's looking for time
[1:04:43] tested materials and and he say another
[1:04:47] spot I'm sorry if these are too many

[1:05:03] man Elisha watched him watched him there
[1:05:06] there there there in the field where he
[1:05:08] was pling and God said that's the man
[1:05:10] that's the man that can wear that that

[1:05:43] are to put on the robe of Christ the
[1:05:45] whole armor of Christ the whole Shield
[1:05:47] the Buckler and the armor that we might
[1:05:49] stand blameless at that day he's looking
[1:05:51] for some time tested memorials as he can
[1:05:53] say there's my servant I've tested him
[1:05:55] I've tried him I put him through like I
[1:05:58] did job and he still proves 100% God be
[1:06:01] merciful to us that we can take God at
[1:06:02] his word and be time tested memorials

[1:16:38] eyes we
[1:16:40] find the
[1:16:43] strength to press
[1:16:46] on as they just play softly I you know
[1:16:50] Israel is a type of us in so many ways
[1:16:54] and the Bible and I see that little Old
[1:16:58] Nation today that is fighting for its
[1:17:03] life fighting for its
[1:17:06] existence and all the nations around are
[1:17:10] turning against her and telling them to
[1:17:13] stop and cease fire and you know work a
[1:17:19] deal but there's something down inside
[1:17:21] them that says no we're not going to do
[1:17:23] that it's our rights it's it's we you
[1:17:28] know and um I thought you know if a
[1:17:32] natural Nation can have that resolve and
[1:17:35] we truly know that their resolve comes
[1:17:39] from God
[1:17:40] Almighty because there's there's that
[1:17:44] 144,000 that has to be
[1:17:47] sealed and they're falling right in line
[1:17:50] it's there she's in position she's she's
[1:17:54] wakening up everything just exactly the
[1:17:56] way God had prophesied and here we see
[1:18:00] them and yet they don't know what who
[1:18:02] they are like we would know who we are
[1:18:05] but yet they're they're following right
[1:18:07] in line and God's behind them God's
[1:18:10] giving them that that motivation that
[1:18:13] whatever you would want to call it and
[1:18:16] um I thought oh God if if a little Old
[1:18:18] Nation can do that what about this
[1:18:21] bride we're the apple of his eye we are
[1:18:24] we are his heartbeat we are his we're
[1:18:27] not just servants we're
[1:18:30] bride we're the ones that he's called to
[1:18:34] reign with
[1:18:36] him you realize that it's already been
[1:18:39] said that we're going to be
[1:18:40] Overcomers already been said that that
[1:18:44] uh we're going to we're going to reign
[1:18:46] with him and I I believe I'm going to be
[1:18:50] that one that's going to reign with him
[1:18:53] and
[1:18:54] we're we're building character now
[1:18:57] because uh Power without character is
[1:19:00] satanic and this this this power
[1:19:05] that been given to us this reain that
[1:19:09] we're going to reign with him it isn't
[1:19:12] going to be inspired of the devil it's
[1:19:14] it's not nothing satanic about it it's

[1:19:19] shaped and molded amen and and coming
[1:19:22] into that image of Christ
[1:19:25] amen and so this bride will have that
[1:19:28] determination to press on no matter what

[1:19:39] to every everybody else she is just a
[1:19:40] little old almost a little spec in on
[1:19:43] the map and yet God chose that Nation
[1:19:47] God chose that people amen and uh the
[1:19:51] promises are there well think of how
[1:19:54] Authority we are as the bride of Christ
[1:19:57] compared to the world of billions and
[1:19:59] billions of people on the face of the
[1:20:01] Earth and there's that small little
