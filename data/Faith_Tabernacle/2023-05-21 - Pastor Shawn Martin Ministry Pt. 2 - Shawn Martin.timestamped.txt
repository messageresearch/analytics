[38:05] fourth chapter and I'm just going to
[38:07] read the first verse but it says let a
[38:09] man sow account of us
[38:11] as of the Ministers of Christ and
[38:14] stewards
[38:16] of the mysteries of God Amen you can
[38:19] have your seeds
[38:23] and this may be just a little odd um
[38:26] scripture reading for but I
[38:31] I hope to
[38:33] um
[38:36] make sense of it but the what I want to
[38:40] say but I'm wanting to continue
[38:42] on the uh subject of last Sunday
[38:48] um there uh and so I'm going to title
[38:52] the the subject of ministry
[38:57] and uh I'm not going to be able to
[38:59] finish it all
[39:01] this morning so I'm going to just take
[39:04] my time for a few minutes and and build
[39:07] on this thought but the the word
[39:10] ministry
[39:13] um is an agent or instrument a person or
[39:17] thing through which something is
[39:19] accomplished
[39:21] an agent or an instrument a person or
[39:25] thing through which something is
[39:28] accomplished so that's the idea of
[39:30] ministry
[39:32] and uh as I said last Sunday that every
[39:37] nation has a purpose
[39:39] it has an agenda
[39:42] and and so each nation has offices or we
[39:47] will call it Ministries
[39:49] where men
[39:52] carry out that purpose the purpose of
[39:55] that Nation
[39:57] and uh our nation you know we have all
[40:02] kinds of Ministries uh we have
[40:05] ambassadors
[40:07] um
[40:08] and who have a specific task we we have
[40:13] the military and within that in the
[40:15] military there are different branches
[40:17] yet the Air Force the Navy the military
[40:19] or the uh uh Marines and uh the the
[40:24] seals and but but they are they are
[40:28] Ministries in in that they are agents to
[40:33] to help
[40:35] um we we have different branches of
[40:38] government such as congressmen Senators
[40:41] Governors mayors
[40:43] and the list goes on and on and on of of
[40:48] how this nation
[40:51] uh is able to do what it does it's it's
[40:55] it's it's
[40:56] because of the branches it's the offices
[40:59] it's the Ministries that are within the
[41:03] nation that carry things out and and so
[41:07] but each each office has a purpose
[41:11] and they're used to accomplish a a
[41:15] purpose and so now what makes it we we
[41:19] see a lot of chaos within the nation and
[41:23] what makes it uh chaotic uh is when you
[41:26] have people filling these positions that
[41:29] refuse to unify around the goal or
[41:33] purpose and
[41:36] um it's it's you know it's it's bad
[41:38] enough when you have uh Republican and
[41:41] Democrat in office you know and
[41:44] um and they're fighting one another you
[41:46] know they they just can't seem to get on
[41:48] the same page
[41:49] uh uh but then it's it's really bad when
[41:55] you have the Republicans fighting
[41:57] Republicans and Democrats fighting
[41:59] Democrats it it brings the chaos to a
[42:03] different level
[42:04] and so uh we see that the party that is
[42:08] Unified most
[42:10] is the strongest it's it's the uh and is
[42:14] able to accomplish more and so uh uh
[42:19] then you you we find that everybody's
[42:22] got their agendas and and so the leaders
[42:25] of each party are trying to unify their
[42:28] party uh to get things accomplished but
[42:32] it just doesn't seem to be able to do it
[42:36] and uh and and the reason why is because
[42:40] it's the Bible has already predicted
[42:43] that it wouldn't it it just won't happen
[42:46] it just can't uh because the nation has
[42:49] got to fall uh and and so it's it's not
[42:54] the outside that's killing our nation
[42:56] it's it's actually within
[42:58] uh the the nation because people just
[43:01] won't unify around a common goal and and
[43:05] you know
[43:07] um but there is a people and I'll put it
[43:10] this way there is a people that are
[43:12] unifying in the government and uh
[43:16] because they got to fulfill scripture I
[43:18] mean it's they are coming together it's
[43:20] it's behind the scenes and and they are
[43:23] determined to get their agenda uh uh out
[43:28] and so uh but but I'm not here to talk
[43:33] about America or the world politics and
[43:36] all these things
[43:37] I am just saying that there are
[43:39] Ministries you you have to have a you
[43:43] have to have Ministries whatever you
[43:45] want to call it governments branches uh
[43:47] whatever uh in in order for the purpose
[43:51] to be fulfilled and and so but as we
[43:56] want to look at it even higher today uh
[44:00] uh that God has a purpose God has a will
[44:03] and it's a Divine will it's an eternal
[44:06] purpose that's what Paul said
[44:09] and and so God
[44:12] um
[44:13] God has uh
[44:17] there has to be a Ministry in order for
[44:20] this will this purpose to be
[44:23] accomplished there there has to be now
[44:25] Colossians 1 16 says for by him were all
[44:29] things created that are in heaven that
[44:33] are in Earth visible invisible whether
[44:35] they be Thrones or dominions or
[44:37] principalities or Powers all things were
[44:41] created by Him and for him ain't that
[44:44] right
[44:44] so then we we find that he is the one
[44:49] that has created these things for his
[44:51] purpose for his will and and for this to
[44:55] be carried out so God has established a
[45:00] Ministry now I I think the idea of
[45:03] ministry comes from God he's the first
[45:05] one and and so uh you you look at it
[45:10] Isaiah 55 10 we know it as the rain
[45:14] cometh down and the snow from heaven and
[45:16] returneth not leather but whatareth the
[45:18] Earth and make it for us and it make us
[45:21] it bring forth and Bud that it may give
[45:23] seed to the sower and bread to the eater
[45:25] so shall my word be that goeth forth out
[45:28] of my mouth it shall not return unto me
[45:30] void but it shall accomplish everybody
[45:32] say shall accomplish that which I please
[45:35] and it shall prosper right in the thing
[45:39] whereto I sent it now when we when when
[45:44] you have uh the nation first was
[45:47] established the men that founded the
[45:49] nation or established it and and uh they
[45:53] they formed a declaration of
[45:56] independence and things but they
[45:58] realized that they they had to have
[46:00] something to to carry these things out
[46:03] they had to have people they had to have
[46:05] agents they had to have branches they
[46:07] had to have offices in order to carry
[46:11] their dream and what they wanted and and
[46:14] these things I think that all come from
[46:17] God man being made in the image of God
[46:20] it it it it it it it it it it come it's
[46:24] it come the original thought came from
[46:27] God now God said my word will be
[46:32] accomplished it will accomplish it it it
[46:35] will prosper in the thing that I sinned
[46:38] to do and I say to you that the word
[46:41] will be accomplished through the
[46:43] ministry by Ministry and so everything
[46:48] that is part of this ministry serves to
[46:53] fulfill God's word do you believe that
[46:56] now uh I know maybe what some of you are
[46:59] quiet for is you're thinking Ministry
[47:01] five-fold Ministry uh I'm going broader
[47:06] than just fifo Ministries so you can
[47:08] relax and take it easy
[47:11] uh uh everything that is a part of this
[47:16] ministry serves to fulfill God's word uh
[47:19] Psalms 34 7
[47:21] uh uh the angel of the Lord and brother
[47:25] Branham uses the plural the angels of
[47:30] the Lord in campus round about them that
[47:33] fear Him and what
[47:36] delivereth them so we'll start right
[47:39] there for just a brief moment but then
[47:42] because the Angels were created a man
[47:46] before Man was created and and and that
[47:49] they were created for a purpose
[47:51] but they are God's ministers they are
[47:54] part of this ministry do you believe
[47:56] that angels are part of the ministry of
[47:59] God
[48:00] uh they have a Ministry brother Brian
[48:02] said they are with us angels are with us
[48:06] to minister spiritual blessings to us
[48:09] and to help us along the road and
[48:12] encourage us as we see the hill of Zion
[48:16] Yonder inside ain't that right so they
[48:19] they have a Ministry and and they do not
[48:22] work apart from God's will God's purpose
[48:25] but it all comes together to fulfill
[48:28] God's word I'm glad that there's Angels
[48:31] I'm glad that God would put Angels by us
[48:35] a man there they help us when we're
[48:37] discouraged they're there to give us
[48:39] encouragement when we we we we find that
[48:43] even when we are trapped by the enemy or
[48:47] in even in the natural when when the
[48:50] apostles there in the book of Acts was
[48:53] was thrown into prison the Bible says
[48:55] that the angel of the Lord came not a
[48:59] man it was an angel of the Lord that
[49:02] came and opened the prison door and set
[49:05] them free
[49:06] now it was a supernatural happening
[49:09] because the next day well first the
[49:12] angel of the Lord told them after he had
[49:15] set him free there in Acts 5 and 20 go
[49:18] stand and speak in the temple to the
[49:20] people all the words of this life so the
[49:23] angel of the lord gave them a command on
[49:26] what to do so the next morning uh uh
[49:30] they they they uh the governor mayor
[49:33] whoever the judge whatever they sent for
[49:37] these men to put him into trial and so
[49:41] when the men came the prison doors were
[49:44] locked the men that were guarding were
[49:47] there
[49:49] the only people that was missing was the
[49:52] ones the angel of the Lord delivered
[49:55] and that was the apostles ain't that
[49:57] right and they found them in the temple
[50:00] preaching the gospel
[50:02] see so God would send his Angel as a
[50:05] minister for to fulfill his will ain't
[50:09] that rhyme brother Branham in one prayer
[50:12] of his ask God to send the angels to
[50:15] stand near the sick so to minister to
[50:18] them the blessings of the Covenant that
[50:21] Jesus Christ made with the sick have you
[50:24] ever just thought of that of of of of of
[50:27] when you're in sickness and there's an
[50:29] encouragement there that that that that
[50:32] comes maybe you were feeling a little
[50:34] low maybe you were feeling a little down
[50:36] and and there's something that strikes
[50:38] your faith and and builds you up and and
[50:41] you just get an energy of yes Lord your
[50:44] word is real
[50:46] I have no doubt that there were angels
[50:49] that are encamped around you that the
[50:52] Lord would send to minister to you see
[50:56] they're ministers and and so don't don't
[50:59] think you're walking this life alone
[51:01] don't think you're fulfilling the
[51:02] Christian walk by yourself there's
[51:05] angels of God that are in kin to all
[51:08] around you and God would create them for
[51:11] his purpose ain't that right amen so we
[51:14] believe in the ministry of the Angels
[51:17] they are there to encourage you they are
[51:20] there to help you they are there to help
[51:22] you believe in in in several instances
[51:25] you'll hear Brother Branham say Lord May
[51:28] the angels of God just stand at their
[51:30] post of Duty stand by every Pew every
[51:34] chair or every person and help them to
[51:37] believe amen why we need the ministers
[51:40] can you say amen and God would have them
[51:43] they are there to inspire you to you
[51:46] Inspire faith in you to give you
[51:48] strength and encouragement and all of
[51:51] these things and and so uh uh but then
[51:54] you know and we we could go on we could
[51:56] talk about the universe and we we talked
[51:59] a little bit about it uh last Sunday but
[52:02] but every every Star is in its place and
[52:05] there's billions and billions of them
[52:07] you can't count them amen and and even
[52:10] if you could count the ones that you see
[52:12] there's stars that you can't even see
[52:14] and there's there's solar systems and
[52:17] and all of that that is that that man
[52:19] hadn't even discovered yet and but yet
[52:22] therefore a purpose do you believe that
[52:26] therefore purpose and the prophet says
[52:28] that if one star it would get out of out
[52:32] of its place it would affect the entire
[52:34] Earth if the moon would get out of its
[52:37] place it would affect the entire Earth
[52:39] everything is for the ministry of God's
[52:43] purpose amen see and so every person and
[52:47] and and now look at it our way uh for a
[52:51] moment at us but every person that is
[52:54] part of the body of Christ is a minister
[52:57] do you believe that you cannot be part
[53:00] of the Menace uh the body of Christ and
[53:02] not be part of of ministry amen uh
[53:06] because you are a man you are in the
[53:08] ministry in whatever role God places you
[53:12] in the body a man First Corinthians 12
[53:15] and 18 but now hath God set the members
[53:19] of every one of them in the body as it
[53:22] pleased him ain't that right not not as
[53:26] it pleased you but as it hath pleased
[53:28] him because God has a purpose and and
[53:31] for you God's not just called you and
[53:34] saved you and then let you twiddle your
[53:36] thumbs until the Rapture a man but you
[53:38] got a Ministry and if one of the
[53:42] Heavenly hosts get out of place what
[53:43] about the Earthly host how it affects
[53:46] ain't that right and so we we see now
[53:49] when when talking about Ministry
[53:52] Ministry is about serving and and I want
[53:56] to get more into that uh uh later but
[53:59] Ministry is about serving and as I've
[54:01] said Ministry is is I believe it was
[54:05] God's idea and he is the first one to
[54:08] implement uh Ministry tree amen and so I
[54:13] want to look at it as God's Ministry not
[54:17] my Ministry not your ministry not the
[54:19] ministry of the Stars not the ministry
[54:22] of angels but God's Ministry for he's
[54:25] the one that created it all for his
[54:27] purpose ain't that right he saved you
[54:30] because he had a purpose in Saving you
[54:32] he didn't just he didn't just save you
[54:35] brother AJ a man he could have saved
[54:37] everybody else around you but he saved
[54:39] you because he got a purpose in that and
[54:42] and and what we are doing as the prophet
[54:45] said now we come to God asking him what
[54:47] was your purpose in Saving me amen I'm
[54:50] glad you saved me but what's the purpose
[54:52] can you say man amen that's right he
[54:55] didn't save you and then you just go do
[54:57] your own thing and and what you think
[54:59] would be best for God's kingdom but God
[55:02] would save you for his will and his
[55:05] purpose and so every one of us uh uh uh
[55:10] are part of God's Ministry if we're part
[55:14] of the body of Christ now today we have
[55:17] been given the privilege uh to know the
[55:20] desire of God before the foundation of
[55:23] the world and and this is the blessings
[55:25] I believe one of the the great blessings
[55:28] of being able to stand in this age after
[55:32] the seals and and and to know God's mind
[55:36] uh many people have lived through the
[55:40] ages not understanding God's mind even
[55:43] though a revelation would come to them
[55:45] and they may write it down in the
[55:47] scripture but maybe not fully understood
[55:50] but in this age it's not only just
[55:54] revealed but there is a people that is
[55:57] understanding and we're not
[55:59] understanding portion of Prophecy we're
[56:01] understanding all prophecy amen see
[56:05] we're not understanding a man say so uh
[56:09] uh we we've been given this prayer
[56:10] privilege
[56:12] to know he has always existed for he is
[56:17] eternal he was lonely and wanted
[56:19] Fellowship right amen he had attributes
[56:23] within him and wanted to express them
[56:25] speaking of God he wanted uh to become a
[56:30] family he wanted to express who he is
[56:33] and what he is to his family and through
[56:36] his family he loved his family and he
[56:40] wanted to receive love from them he
[56:43] wanted to have relationship with his
[56:46] family can you say amen amen and and and
[56:49] and these things have now been made
[56:52] known to us and opened up up a a a whole
[56:56] new
[56:57] uh way of Christian life amen uh more
[57:03] than just coming to church and and and
[57:05] and and fulfilling a a duty at the
[57:09] church or doing what is required or
[57:12] whatever amen but we're understanding
[57:14] why we're here why amen we come to the
[57:19] house of God what drives us is because
[57:22] God desired something from us he desired
[57:25] Fellowship he desired expression he
[57:28] wanted to express himself not just to
[57:30] you brother shalom but through you a man
[57:34] say he he wanted this and and so we we
[57:37] find that God was Elohim a man before
[57:41] anything else amen even before oxygen
[57:45] was was there and and uh uh there was
[57:50] Elohim God existed he was the
[57:53] self-existent one ain't that right amen
[57:56] and so he was lonely in this
[57:59] self-existence he knew who he was he
[58:01] knew what he was capable of he knew what
[58:03] was in him but he he he
[58:06] uh was lonely because there was nothing
[58:10] there her Amen to Fellowship a man sees
[58:14] so then he became God after created the
[58:17] angels for God is an object of worship
[58:20] ain't that right amen he didn't need man
[58:24] in the say in the sense to make him God
[58:27] Amen he was already worshiped by the
[58:31] creation that he had created cherubims
[58:34] and seraphims and all kinds of Angels
[58:36] were there around the Throne of God Amen
[58:40] constantly continually worshiping him
[58:43] ain't that right amen but it didn't
[58:46] fulfill God's longing a man for
[58:49] Fellowship
[58:52] and then we find God became father
[58:57] not when he created the draft
[59:00] not when he created angels not when he
[59:03] created the monkey
[59:05] amen but when he created Adam
[59:08] and we know what father is it's a parent
[59:11] he became a parent
[59:14] amen because now he created something
[59:18] that was from him
[59:20] for he said let us make man in our own
[59:23] image ain't that right so not one Angel
[59:26] was made like Adam not one animal was
[59:29] made like Adam there was Adam there was
[59:32] nothing in God's creation that was made
[59:35] like Adam hey ain't that right Adam was
[59:38] made in God's Own image which made him
[59:42] God's son a man an offspring of God
[59:46] ain't that right so what makes us long
[59:49] for Fellowship amen with God what makes
[59:52] us one his approval what makes us want
[59:55] to know him more what makes us want to
[59:58] please him is because we are his
[1:00:01] children
[1:00:04] you believe that we are his children you
[1:00:07] realize that God never made uh uh you
[1:00:10] for the Angels but he made angels for
[1:00:12] you
[1:00:14] he never made you to ministered Angels
[1:00:17] but he made angels to minister to you
[1:00:20] that's right see so many times we are
[1:00:23] guilty of of thinking uh that our desire
[1:00:27] for him is greater than his desire for
[1:00:30] us amen but but that's not true sometime
[1:00:35] we we might think that that we want the
[1:00:38] Holy Ghost more than God wants to give
[1:00:39] it to us that's not true
[1:00:42] ain't that right amen said the prophet
[1:00:45] said he's closer to you than his door
[1:00:48] and his door is your heart
[1:00:52] now you think of that where's your heart
[1:00:53] somewhere dropping here right and yet
[1:00:56] he's closer to you brother Tim than he
[1:00:58] is your heart
[1:01:00] that's right he's so close tonight he's
[1:01:02] closer to you than your right arm is
[1:01:04] he's part of you
[1:01:07] ain't that right and if we could only
[1:01:09] realize that he's here and how he wants
[1:01:12] to have fellowship with us his heart is
[1:01:14] greater for Fellowship than ours is
[1:01:18] he wants to fellowship with you more
[1:01:21] than you'll ever want to fellowship with
[1:01:23] him it wasn't you that bargained with
[1:01:25] God it wasn't you that came to God and
[1:01:27] said I want to have some fellowship God
[1:01:29] he put the desire in you and he began to
[1:01:32] woo you for Fellowship he longed to have
[1:01:35] Fellowship can you say man he's the one
[1:01:37] that promised I'll never leave you nor
[1:01:39] forsake you I'll be with you to the end
[1:01:41] of the world when you forget about God
[1:01:44] he doesn't forget when you're in your
[1:01:46] complaints he's not complaining can you
[1:01:49] say man amen when you want to turn your
[1:01:52] back and walk away from it all God will
[1:01:54] never turn his back
[1:01:57] very true very true amen
[1:02:02] what makes a mother
[1:02:04] dashed through a burning fire
[1:02:07] not thinking about her own self
[1:02:11] the prophesied her hair on fire clothes
[1:02:13] on fire
[1:02:15] The Edge she'll go there and grab that
[1:02:16] baby
[1:02:18] and run out with that baby and do
[1:02:19] everything she can to protect that baby
[1:02:22] what makes a man give his own life for
[1:02:24] his wife
[1:02:27] not caring
[1:02:30] about danger anything he's there to
[1:02:34] protect her protect his children protect
[1:02:37] his family
[1:02:38] what is it you know what the prophet
[1:02:40] said it's a strain in you that comes
[1:02:43] from God
[1:02:45] see You're Made In His Image
[1:02:48] and it's the same strain that he has for
[1:02:51] you
[1:02:54] and you say man
[1:02:55] so when we look at a true genuine father
[1:02:58] or mother we begin to get and just a
[1:03:02] partial idea and I'm I'm talking about
[1:03:05] just a little idea
[1:03:07] of God's heart toward his children
[1:03:11] his own children
[1:03:13] he's Papa God
[1:03:15] he's father can you say Amen
[1:03:18] that's right see so the love of a father
[1:03:20] or mother can never compare with that of
[1:03:24] the love of God
[1:03:28] Matthew 7 11 if you then being evil know
[1:03:32] how to give good gifts unto your
[1:03:35] children how much more shall your father
[1:03:38] which is in heaven give good things to
[1:03:40] them that ask him
[1:03:42] ain't that right
[1:03:43] how much more so he's trying to
[1:03:45] establish himself by the natural parent
[1:03:48] and the father and mother
[1:03:50] and and he's wanting you to get just a
[1:03:53] little bit of of what he feels towards
[1:03:55] you but he says it's greater than the
[1:03:58] love of a of a father or a mother ain't
[1:04:01] that right
[1:04:02] Isaiah 49 15 God asks can a woman forget
[1:04:06] her sucking child that she should not
[1:04:09] have compassion on the son of her womb
[1:04:11] yay they may forgive yet will I not
[1:04:14] everybody say will I not forget thee
[1:04:18] he won't forget you
[1:04:21] now is that his word or not he won't
[1:04:23] forget you
[1:04:25] behold behold I have gravened thee
[1:04:31] on the palm of my hands
[1:04:35] ain't that right
[1:04:36] there's there you can't be erased
[1:04:39] you're engraving in his hands so for for
[1:04:43] Satan to take you from God Amen went to
[1:04:46] be take part of God and for Satan to
[1:04:49] hurt you is to hurt God
[1:04:53] for Satan to destroy you is to destroy
[1:04:55] God
[1:04:56] is wanting to show us that you're not
[1:04:59] just a an object over there and he's
[1:05:02] looking after you you're right here not
[1:05:05] just being held by him but you're
[1:05:07] engraving in his hands
[1:05:11] and I have to I just say it it has to be
[1:05:14] the right hand in his right hand
[1:05:18] where his power is
[1:05:22] Behold thy Graven thee upon the palm of
[1:05:25] my hands thy walls are continually
[1:05:28] before me
[1:05:30] come on
[1:05:34] Ministry
[1:05:37] Ministry actually started
[1:05:40] from what I can see so you just have to
[1:05:43] excuse me
[1:05:44] but I I believe that Ministry started
[1:05:48] before the foundation of the world
[1:05:52] and as I say Ministry is about serving
[1:05:55] it's
[1:05:58] it's an agent
[1:06:02] where where my personal thing
[1:06:07] an agent is a person or thing
[1:06:10] by which something is accomplished
[1:06:12] Ministry
[1:06:15] God
[1:06:16] God himself implemented Ministry
[1:06:20] Before Time
[1:06:22] and he put
[1:06:24] every one of his children's names
[1:06:27] on the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:06:34] now
[1:06:38] standing in this age
[1:06:40] that means so much
[1:06:44] that God would do that back then
[1:06:48] and what he was doing was securing you
[1:06:53] ain't that right
[1:06:55] he he
[1:06:57] through Ministry
[1:07:00] he put your name in the Lamb's Book of
[1:07:02] Life to secure you
[1:07:04] [Music]
[1:07:06] but also a lamb was slain before the
[1:07:08] foundation of the world
[1:07:12] ain't that right
[1:07:15] Romans 8 30 tells us that there are a
[1:07:17] people that God predestinated before the
[1:07:21] foundation of the world
[1:07:23] Ministry
[1:07:27] he also called them
[1:07:29] Justified them and glorified them
[1:07:34] ain't that right
[1:07:36] we see God's Ministry not just in his
[1:07:39] mind
[1:07:42] as a pre-thought
[1:07:45] but we see God's Ministry in his
[1:07:48] creation
[1:07:50] God knew that his children would arrive
[1:07:52] on the Earth
[1:07:54] amen
[1:07:55] he didn't make the Earth for himself
[1:07:58] he made it all for you
[1:08:02] right
[1:08:04] so he knew that his children would come
[1:08:06] to the Earth so he prepared for our
[1:08:09] arrival
[1:08:12] and when when we arrived
[1:08:18] God had already finished it
[1:08:22] there were the mountains
[1:08:24] there was the Lakes the rivers
[1:08:27] there was The Valleys that in the
[1:08:30] deserts
[1:08:31] there it all was laying there
[1:08:36] ain't that right well Brown said they
[1:08:38] were here first because of the kindness
[1:08:40] of our heavenly father placed them
[1:08:45] and he did it because he knew that there
[1:08:47] would be some that would like the
[1:08:49] mountains
[1:08:51] there would be some that would like the
[1:08:53] rivers
[1:08:55] there would be some that would like the
[1:08:57] deserts
[1:09:00] ain't that right
[1:09:03] there would be some that would like you
[1:09:06] know the planes
[1:09:07] brother Rand said he knew your nature
[1:09:11] so aren't you glad that God had an
[1:09:13] infinite mind to know
[1:09:15] he knew
[1:09:18] so he wasn't making things just well
[1:09:22] I think I think I think they'll want
[1:09:24] this I think they'll like it but he knew
[1:09:27] your nature
[1:09:30] and thus he created it
[1:09:33] by that
[1:09:35] he knew your nature and what you would
[1:09:37] be so he made it just the way that you
[1:09:40] could enjoy it
[1:09:42] [Music]
[1:09:44] he prepared everything before we got
[1:09:47] here
[1:09:50] and then we find that just before Jesus
[1:09:53] ascended into heaven there in John 14
[1:09:57] and 2 he said in my father's house or
[1:09:59] many mansions if it were not so I would
[1:10:01] have told you I go to prepare a place
[1:10:04] for you
[1:10:06] and if I go and prepare a place for you
[1:10:09] I will come again
[1:10:11] ain't that right and receive you unto
[1:10:14] myself that where I am there you may be
[1:10:18] also
[1:10:20] do you believe it's already prepared
[1:10:24] it's there it's prepared
[1:10:27] God in his ministry
[1:10:30] seeking of you
[1:10:33] that when you would get there
[1:10:35] it wouldn't be all chaotic
[1:10:38] but it would be just according to your
[1:10:40] liking
[1:10:45] he's prepared for our our arrival
[1:10:51] in his creation he made made it in such
[1:10:54] a way that his children could see him
[1:10:57] reflected in it
[1:10:59] you can see God in the grass you can see
[1:11:01] God in the trees
[1:11:03] you can see God's majesty and how great
[1:11:05] he is in the mountains
[1:11:10] you can see God's faithfulness
[1:11:13] when you look in the desert and you see
[1:11:15] out of all that bleakness or something
[1:11:16] living
[1:11:19] God faithful to that little flower he's
[1:11:21] faithful to us
[1:11:25] you can see God everywhere
[1:11:28] you can see God in the Stars
[1:11:33] foreign
[1:11:35] that we could understand his ways
[1:11:38] he made Creation in a way that his
[1:11:41] children could be aware of his presence
[1:11:43] by beholding his creation
[1:11:46] amen
[1:11:48] I think it was brother Brown talking
[1:11:50] about that man that went went uh
[1:11:54] he went hunting with and you know or
[1:11:57] maybe he was hunting with the preacher
[1:11:59] and
[1:12:00] he told the preacher I gave my heart to
[1:12:03] the Lord and he said well what was it
[1:12:04] was it the sermon I preached was it this
[1:12:06] was it that he goes no he's standing out
[1:12:08] here and
[1:12:09] sing God's creation
[1:12:12] maybe seeing the setting of The Sun I
[1:12:14] can't remember what it was that inspired
[1:12:17] him but see he saw God in nature
[1:12:21] ain't that right
[1:12:24] so we we find that God has never done
[1:12:26] anything without having a purpose for
[1:12:29] doing it
[1:12:31] I'm again just wanting to establish that
[1:12:34] thought of ministry
[1:12:36] God has never done anything without
[1:12:38] having a purpose he has never done
[1:12:40] anything for the purpose of just showing
[1:12:42] off he has never done anything for
[1:12:44] vainglory
[1:12:46] he's never done anything that would
[1:12:48] destroy his own family
[1:12:52] everything has been set for his children
[1:12:54] his own family
[1:12:57] amen
[1:13:00] so then we find that the foundation for
[1:13:03] Ministry is love
[1:13:06] Divine love
[1:13:08] and this ministry Ministry exists
[1:13:11] because of the love of God
[1:13:14] we see this exemplified
[1:13:17] uh after God's children sinned
[1:13:22] they did what God told them not to do
[1:13:27] and God told them the day you do it
[1:13:30] it'll be in that day you'll die
[1:13:35] well they did it
[1:13:37] not understanding or realizing the real
[1:13:40] consequence of it
[1:13:44] and when they sinned it separated them
[1:13:46] from God
[1:13:49] ain't that right
[1:13:51] they failed from that Holy image
[1:13:55] so now man has a fallen nature
[1:13:58] that's carnal and enmity against God
[1:14:03] I want you to think of that
[1:14:06] no man seeks after God
[1:14:10] Jesus said no man can come to me except
[1:14:12] the father draws him
[1:14:15] ain't that right
[1:14:17] no man knoweth the father no man knoweth
[1:14:20] the son
[1:14:21] no one knoweth the father but by the son
[1:14:24] no one knoweth the son except the father
[1:14:26] first reveals him
[1:14:28] I have not seen nor Earth heard
[1:14:32] neither has it entered into the heart of
[1:14:34] man the things that God's prepared
[1:14:36] see when he fell he fell
[1:14:40] so separated him that as of today there
[1:14:45] are people that aren't even conscience
[1:14:46] of God
[1:14:49] there may have even been some of God's
[1:14:52] children that didn't even believe that
[1:14:53] he existed
[1:14:56] have you ever thought of that
[1:15:00] maybe cursed him
[1:15:06] but God's love toward his children his
[1:15:09] family has never wavered
[1:15:14] brother Branham
[1:15:17] talks about when
[1:15:19] God
[1:15:20] talked with Adam and Eve he said Yonder
[1:15:24] I see Adam and Eve
[1:15:26] first little sweethearts there in the
[1:15:27] Garden of Eden
[1:15:29] I see Adam back there when he put his
[1:15:31] arms around his little sweetheart to
[1:15:33] walk out with her for God had condemned
[1:15:35] them
[1:15:36] and he started out with his arms around
[1:15:38] his darling
[1:15:40] Adam was not deceived he did have to
[1:15:42] walk out but he walked out because he
[1:15:45] loved his wife
[1:15:46] he walked out with both eyes wide open
[1:15:49] no matter if he had she had to go to
[1:15:51] torment he'd go with her
[1:15:53] when God looked down and seen that love
[1:15:57] of a human being it was so great that he
[1:16:00] couldn't stand it himself
[1:16:03] and he said I will come and go too
[1:16:07] and said I'll put enmity between her
[1:16:10] seed and the serpent seed
[1:16:13] we find four thousand years later or so
[1:16:17] that God come down manifested in the
[1:16:19] flesh and went to the very Flames the
[1:16:22] prophet said the hottest of suffering
[1:16:24] that he might bring us into fellowship
[1:16:27] with him taking no thought of his own
[1:16:29] not my will but fine be done
[1:16:33] and you say man ever since the false man
[1:16:37] has been under Satan's control Satan has
[1:16:41] been able to flick man with the uh uh
[1:16:44] sickness and disease he has been able to
[1:16:46] enslave Mankind and used man for his own
[1:16:50] evil devices
[1:16:52] he's been able to put that to wedge
[1:16:54] between God and man
[1:16:59] ain't that right
[1:17:01] and that wedge is stronger today than
[1:17:04] ever
[1:17:06] mankind has never been the same since
[1:17:09] the fall
[1:17:11] but God determined
[1:17:14] to redeem his children
[1:17:19] I'm so glad there was Ministry
[1:17:23] God determined
[1:17:26] to redeem his children
[1:17:29] and he came up with the plan the Plan of
[1:17:31] Redemption
[1:17:33] right
[1:17:34] wide to bring healing to both soul and
[1:17:37] body
[1:17:39] to bring Deliverance to bring Salvation
[1:17:42] to bring restoration
[1:17:44] God would provide a way Escape through
[1:17:48] his ministry
[1:17:49] he would provide a way of Escape so that
[1:17:52] man could be reconciled back to God and
[1:17:55] they could both be one again
[1:17:58] can you say Amen
[1:18:01] see so then if in order to do that a
[1:18:04] substitute had to be provided yes being
[1:18:06] a little simple this morning but I want
[1:18:08] to get it across
[1:18:10] a substitute had to be provided and this
[1:18:13] word substitute is to put or use in
[1:18:16] another play in place of another
[1:18:19] a person or thing that takes the place
[1:18:21] of another
[1:18:23] can you say amen and that was the only
[1:18:25] way for God to bring restoration that's
[1:18:27] the only way that God could restore man
[1:18:30] and bring his desires is that he would
[1:18:34] provide the substitute
[1:18:36] ain't that right man could not provide
[1:18:39] the substitute he was the head of all
[1:18:41] creation but he failed and when he fell
[1:18:44] everything under him fell
[1:18:47] and he could not create for only God can
[1:18:50] create
[1:18:51] ain't that right so therefore God in his
[1:18:56] ministry would provide a substitute
[1:19:01] amen ain't that right
[1:19:04] he didn't just do it for the fact of of
[1:19:06] creating he did it for you and I
[1:19:10] in the Book of Genesis he showed what
[1:19:12] kind of substitute he would provide
[1:19:15] after Adam and Eve realized that they
[1:19:18] had sinned
[1:19:20] they had no covering
[1:19:24] they stood naked and and so
[1:19:27] Adam the Bible says got his own covering
[1:19:32] by sowing live fig leaves together
[1:19:37] thinking that God would not see their
[1:19:39] nakedness
[1:19:41] but we find that when the presence of
[1:19:43] God come in the garden looking to meet
[1:19:46] with Adam and Eve
[1:19:48] it becomes so apparent
[1:19:52] that they could not stand
[1:19:55] in the presence of God in their own
[1:19:57] covering
[1:20:00] so they ran and hid
[1:20:03] the Bible says God began to search for
[1:20:05] Adam Adam Where Art Thou
[1:20:12] he knew that something was wrong
[1:20:16] because the place where he met them they
[1:20:18] weren't there
[1:20:23] I think the atmosphere had changed
[1:20:27] I I think all creation changed
[1:20:31] death loomed on everything
[1:20:40] Genesis 3 and 9 says in the Lord God
[1:20:42] called unto Adam and said unto him where
[1:20:44] art thou
[1:20:46] and he said I heard thy voice in the
[1:20:49] garden and I was afraid because I was
[1:20:51] naked and I hid myself
[1:20:54] and he said but who told thee
[1:20:57] the thou was naked
[1:21:01] thou Eaton of the tree
[1:21:04] whereof I have commanded thee that thou
[1:21:06] shouldest not eat
[1:21:09] now you see
[1:21:11] if you can think of it this way that
[1:21:14] he didn't need anyone to tell him he was
[1:21:16] naked
[1:21:18] his own heart condemned him
[1:21:22] when he's coming to the presence of God
[1:21:24] there was something that condemned him
[1:21:29] he didn't feel that before
[1:21:32] his eyes was open
[1:21:35] ain't that right
[1:21:37] so in God's Eden as the prophet would
[1:21:40] tell us they were both naked without a
[1:21:42] stitch of clothes on them and they knew
[1:21:44] it you know and and they knew it not
[1:21:48] they they they they're in that garden
[1:21:51] and there's no clothes and and no
[1:21:53] covering and they knew it not brother
[1:21:55] Brandon says why didn't they know it for
[1:21:58] they were veiled to their senses of
[1:22:00] nakedness by the holy veil of the Holy
[1:22:03] Spirit
[1:22:05] they could look right at each other and
[1:22:07] didn't know
[1:22:09] that they were naked they were veiled
[1:22:12] with the Holy Spirit of holiness
[1:22:16] the spirit of Holiness veiled their eyes
[1:22:21] they were veiled they were saved in
[1:22:25] God's Pavilion
[1:22:28] ain't that right so the Holy Spirit was
[1:22:31] over their eyes and they saw nothing but
[1:22:33] their brother and sister
[1:22:36] that's what the prophet said
[1:22:39] ain't that right
[1:22:41] I say it to you today it takes God's
[1:22:43] Veil
[1:22:44] today
[1:22:46] it still takes that veil of Holiness to
[1:22:50] look and not lust
[1:22:52] can you say Amen
[1:22:54] and then that's that's the only way that
[1:22:57] a man will go in this evil rotten
[1:23:00] adulterous age without lusting is you've
[1:23:03] got to have the veil of holiness
[1:23:06] that covers your eyes
[1:23:08] can you say man it'll make you turn your
[1:23:10] head
[1:23:13] ain't that right
[1:23:14] so I won't say it this way don't despise
[1:23:16] holiness
[1:23:19] people have made Holiness all about the
[1:23:22] outward apparel
[1:23:24] made it a Doctrine or a form of legalism
[1:23:27] but Holiness is the spirit of God for
[1:23:30] God is Holy
[1:23:32] do you believe that
[1:23:33] a man living clean on the outside is
[1:23:36] just part of it
[1:23:38] amen but there's a lot of people that
[1:23:40] live clean and have a Holiness standards
[1:23:43] that ain't wholly inside
[1:23:45] ain't that right
[1:23:48] well it's true
[1:23:52] too many times we work on the outside
[1:23:54] instead of working on the end God
[1:23:56] letting God work on the inside
[1:23:58] if God can work on that inside he'll
[1:24:00] work on that outside he'll fix that
[1:24:02] outside
[1:24:03] can you say man amen see we need the
[1:24:06] spirit of Holiness in this day so they
[1:24:09] did not know that they were naked
[1:24:11] because the Holiness of God kept their
[1:24:14] eyes veiled God hid their conscience
[1:24:17] from sin by the holy Veil
[1:24:22] so you see what God needed to do for you
[1:24:26] and I he needed to provide a holy Veil
[1:24:35] there's going to be a bride without spot
[1:24:36] wrinkle or blemish in this age
[1:24:39] [Music]
[1:24:40] do you believe it
[1:24:42] now the book of Hebrews says the
[1:24:44] worshiper once purged has no more
[1:24:45] conscience of sin do you believe what
[1:24:48] you understand what we're saying that if
[1:24:51] you are thoroughly purged I'm not
[1:24:54] talking about Temptation I'm not talking
[1:24:55] about these things but there is a veil
[1:24:58] that covers your eyes to where you'll
[1:25:01] walk away
[1:25:04] can you say Amen no more conscience the
[1:25:08] prophet said sin has passed from him
[1:25:11] see we're in Satan's Eden are we not
[1:25:15] and the people are returning back to
[1:25:18] nakedness
[1:25:19] I'd say they have
[1:25:21] [Music]
[1:25:25] and the prophet said they are veiled by
[1:25:28] an Unholy Veil
[1:25:30] the spirit of unholiness uncleanliness
[1:25:33] and lust has veiled them education
[1:25:37] science why it's scientific scientific
[1:25:40] they say wear shorts it's cooler
[1:25:43] scientific science
[1:25:47] he said the Indians teach you better
[1:25:49] than that they wrap up in a blanket to
[1:25:51] be air-conditioned and and and put on
[1:25:54] them see and and so education has
[1:25:57] absolutely come back to a Time the very
[1:26:00] thing that they seek has brought them to
[1:26:02] culture and civilization has put them
[1:26:05] back in ignorance again worse than they
[1:26:09] was in the first place
[1:26:14] is that right
[1:26:15] look at the age that we're in notice
[1:26:17] What God Says to the laodicean age there
[1:26:19] in Revelations 3 17 because thou says
[1:26:22] I'm rich and increased with Goods
[1:26:24] and have need of nothing and no it's not
[1:26:26] everybody say no it's not you can go
[1:26:29] look listen to the message and and what
[1:26:31] is that Noah know it not
[1:26:34] that not
[1:26:36] no it's not that thou art wretched and
[1:26:39] miserable poor blind and naked ain't
[1:26:42] that right what is it it's the veil of
[1:26:44] unholiness over their eyes
[1:26:48] that's right see and and so then you
[1:26:51] look here's second Corinthians 4 and 4
[1:26:53] in whom the God of this world hath
[1:26:55] blinded the minds of them that which
[1:26:59] believe not lest the light of the
[1:27:01] Glorious gospel of Christ who is the
[1:27:03] image of God should shine unto them
[1:27:05] ain't that right so it's it's a
[1:27:07] blindness it's it's this unholiness the
[1:27:10] veil of unholiness is a blindness to
[1:27:13] where the people can't see the light of
[1:27:16] the Glorious gospel First Timothy 4 and
[1:27:19] 2 says have they have their conscience
[1:27:22] seared with the hot iron that brother
[1:27:25] Bradham said their heart has become
[1:27:28] seared
[1:27:30] amen now something about Adam is that
[1:27:33] when he did Sin there was something in
[1:27:35] them to convict him there was something
[1:27:37] in him to recognize that hold it this
[1:27:39] ain't right
[1:27:40] I ain't the way I used to be things
[1:27:43] ain't the way they used to be
[1:27:45] see he tried to go into the presence of
[1:27:47] God with his own ideas his own covering
[1:27:50] his own his own thoughts his own works
[1:27:53] his own this and it didn't work he had
[1:27:55] to run
[1:27:57] so he wasn't like the people of today
[1:28:01] that have their hearts seared they're
[1:28:03] blinded by this veil of unholiness
[1:28:06] the heart doesn't condemn them
[1:28:09] so when Adam and Eve sin their heart
[1:28:11] condemned them they ran and hid from the
[1:28:13] presence of God
[1:28:14] ain't that right people will broadly
[1:28:17] walk into the presence of God and it
[1:28:18] doesn't face them
[1:28:22] in this age
[1:28:26] but now
[1:28:28] after the fall watch the ministry of God
[1:28:31] go to work
[1:28:34] God
[1:28:36] provided a substitute for them
[1:28:41] ain't that right
[1:28:42] Genesis 3 8 unto Adam also and to his
[1:28:46] wife did the Lord God make coats of skin
[1:28:49] and clothe them
[1:28:51] who did it God
[1:28:54] so loved his children
[1:28:57] that he would provide a way
[1:28:59] for them to come into His presence again
[1:29:03] hello
[1:29:05] it's true
[1:29:06] and I say to you that God in his
[1:29:09] ministry is still clothing his people
[1:29:17] if you'll notice
[1:29:19] God used a specific thing to clothe them
[1:29:24] you something that Adam and his carnal
[1:29:26] Fallen condition
[1:29:28] didn't think of using
[1:29:31] God took a lamb and slew it
[1:29:33] that right
[1:29:37] something that
[1:29:39] the world may not think about
[1:29:41] is the blood of that animal was shed by
[1:29:44] God killing it
[1:29:46] and taking the skin off see it it took
[1:29:49] something it it it it it took something
[1:29:52] with blood
[1:29:54] you with me
[1:29:58] I know this is simple but
[1:30:00] it took something with blood
[1:30:03] God's ministry will always have blood
[1:30:09] as long as his children is here
[1:30:14] on this Earth his ministry will have
[1:30:18] blood
[1:30:21] and you say Amen
[1:30:25] for it's the only way that man can be
[1:30:27] reconciled back to God
[1:30:30] there's power in the blood
[1:30:33] there's healing in the blood
[1:30:35] there's Deliverance in the blood
[1:30:38] you believe it forgiveness in the blood
[1:30:40] reconciliation is in the blood
[1:30:43] the ministry of God has never been
[1:30:46] without blood
[1:30:49] So Adam tried to cover himself with
[1:30:52] something that had no blood but it
[1:30:54] didn't work it was a self-made religion
[1:30:57] it was a Ministry that God was not a
[1:31:00] part of
[1:31:03] right
[1:31:05] it had no power in it
[1:31:10] unless the prophet tells us Adams
[1:31:14] Adam's work what Adam did represents all
[1:31:18] religions of the world today
[1:31:21] self-made self-serving carnal-inspired
[1:31:25] carnal mind
[1:31:27] today the religions relied denominations
[1:31:30] rely on their Creeds and dogmas they
[1:31:33] light rely on their own inspiration they
[1:31:36] rely on their forms of worship
[1:31:40] they have a form of godliness but denied
[1:31:42] the very power of the earth brother
[1:31:44] Graham said fundamental in Doctrine but
[1:31:46] powerless in power
[1:31:51] Creed's dogmas forms of worship are
[1:31:53] powerless theology is powerless brother
[1:31:57] Brian said we have built great hospitals
[1:31:59] and schools in great places and
[1:32:02] seminaries and educated our preachers to
[1:32:04] make them so they can speak with fine
[1:32:05] very fine swelled words and use the
[1:32:09] psychology and stand stiff and say Amen
[1:32:11] just as plight as it can be and all of
[1:32:14] that and what has it got us a big bunch
[1:32:19] of backslidden people
[1:32:21] nothing but a bunch of cold formal in
[1:32:25] different churches as cold as zero
[1:32:27] weather spiritually speaking
[1:32:30] that's not the ministry of God
[1:32:40] brother Brown said I challenge any man
[1:32:42] to show me any organization on fire for
[1:32:44] God filled with the Holy Ghost with
[1:32:47] signs following them rise and tell me
[1:32:49] one any organization there's no such a
[1:32:51] thing it's not on the pages that's right
[1:32:53] they're all powerless and dead get it
[1:32:57] see he says but he also prophesied there
[1:33:00] would be a real Church
[1:33:02] in that day a little flock a Remnant he
[1:33:06] said there would be and there will be
[1:33:08] there will be a people who know their
[1:33:11] God said the prophet and will do great
[1:33:13] exploits in the last days
[1:33:16] so notice the difference in Ministry
[1:33:22] God's Ministry has power in it
[1:33:27] man's Ministry has no power in it
[1:33:32] can you say Amen brother bran said God
[1:33:35] hates a powerless religion
[1:33:37] and any religion today that hasn't got
[1:33:39] Christ in it is powerless
[1:33:41] and what is Christ he's our lamb
[1:33:44] he's where the blood flows from
[1:33:48] you believe that
[1:33:50] amen see it ain't got Christ in it but
[1:33:52] any religion that's that Christ is in
[1:33:55] under his own blood it's got power in it
[1:34:03] thinking of Ministries in the blood
[1:34:08] the Bible tells us that when Moses
[1:34:12] built the Tabernacle
[1:34:14] and he was putting all the instruments
[1:34:17] for Ministry in the Tabernacle
[1:34:21] that he sprinkled both Tabernacle and
[1:34:24] the vessels and and the Bible calls it
[1:34:27] vessels of ministry
[1:34:29] with blood
[1:34:32] every vessel that would be used in the
[1:34:35] ministry had to have blood
[1:34:39] the temple the Tabernacle had to have
[1:34:41] blood
[1:34:43] because it would be God's Ministry
[1:34:47] and you say man
[1:34:49] Hebrews 9 21 moreover he sprinkled the
[1:34:52] blood with blood both the Tabernacle and
[1:34:53] all the vessels of the ministry
[1:34:55] and almost all things
[1:34:58] are by the law purged with blood
[1:35:01] and without the shedding of blood is no
[1:35:04] remission
[1:35:06] ain't that right so everything that was
[1:35:09] to be used we see God in his ministry
[1:35:12] going to provide something
[1:35:14] now to bring reconciliation to him
[1:35:17] God in his ministry
[1:35:19] I want to provide something
[1:35:21] that would break the Fetters of the
[1:35:23] devil over his children
[1:35:27] and he starts with blood
[1:35:33] we read in Genesis
[1:35:36] where the two brothers Cain and Abel
[1:35:39] made an offering to the Lord
[1:35:41] Abel killed a lamb and offered it
[1:35:44] to God and God respected it
[1:35:47] why blood was shed
[1:35:50] came he took of what he had grown
[1:35:56] his own works
[1:35:58] oh it was alive but there wasn't no
[1:36:01] blood in it
[1:36:03] and he offered it to God and God refused
[1:36:06] it
[1:36:07] wrong Ministry
[1:36:09] ain't that right
[1:36:13] and how did Abel know to offer a bloody
[1:36:16] sacrifice well Hebrews 11 4 says by
[1:36:19] faith Abel offered unto God a more
[1:36:21] excellent sacrifice than Cain
[1:36:24] you see there's a Ministry but then
[1:36:26] there's a more excellent Ministry
[1:36:29] there's an offering but then there's a
[1:36:31] more excellent offering
[1:36:33] there's a way but then there's a more
[1:36:35] excellent way
[1:36:38] ain't that right so by faith Abel
[1:36:41] offered unto God a more excellent
[1:36:43] sacrifice than it came by which he
[1:36:47] obtained that he was righteous
[1:36:53] well what is faith faith is a revelation
[1:36:56] that comes from God
[1:36:58] ain't that right gang didn't do it by
[1:37:00] faith because he had no revelation
[1:37:03] well he was inspired but it was a carnal
[1:37:07] inspiration
[1:37:09] man ain't that right but Abel was in the
[1:37:13] line of God
[1:37:15] for he had received the revelation
[1:37:20] a Ministry
[1:37:22] so by Revelation Abel offered a bloody
[1:37:25] lamb
[1:37:26] and it was more excellent
[1:37:28] than Cain's sacrifice
[1:37:31] Abel's sacrifice was a mess
[1:37:34] it was bloody
[1:37:36] ain't that right but it was more
[1:37:38] excellent
[1:37:40] and I want to tell you today it doesn't
[1:37:41] take a ministry that's polished up
[1:37:45] we don't need Paul stunt Ministries
[1:37:50] I think God's Ministry is a mess
[1:37:59] there's blood in it
[1:38:01] it's a mess
[1:38:04] people want to be so dignified when they
[1:38:06] give their heart to the Lord
[1:38:07] it's a mess
[1:38:13] it's it's it's a mess slobbering crying
[1:38:16] it's not slinging it's a mess
[1:38:20] brother Brown was against these dry-eyed
[1:38:22] confessions
[1:38:24] no convictions
[1:38:28] ain't that right
[1:38:30] yes sir and this is what more and more
[1:38:32] we get is is is is dried out confessions
[1:38:39] but God's Ministry is a mess
[1:38:42] it's got blood
[1:38:44] it's not here to be polished up
[1:38:47] it's not here God doesn't need a big
[1:38:50] fine fancy building
[1:38:51] to preach in
[1:38:54] he doesn't require some polished up
[1:38:56] family
[1:38:58] to have a Ministry in that family
[1:39:02] and you say man
[1:39:04] it just takes a Ministry with blood in
[1:39:06] it
[1:39:09] amen it might be a mess but that's the
[1:39:11] thing God will vindicate
[1:39:14] you believe it
[1:39:16] so therefore right after Adam first
[1:39:18] sinned God had a way of redemption
[1:39:21] for him right quick the prophet said
[1:39:24] and see before Adam could ever approach
[1:39:27] back to fellowship with the father God
[1:39:29] had to slay an innocent lamb
[1:39:33] he says the very first sin was committed
[1:39:35] uh uh God would rock her off her place
[1:39:40] because he's holy talk about the world
[1:39:43] and his words are right before he could
[1:39:46] even talk to Adam and Eve he had to make
[1:39:49] a sin offering there with a lamb
[1:39:53] ain't that right
[1:39:55] I'm I'm I hope this is all right
[1:39:59] God's Ministry knows the way of approach
[1:40:03] God's Ministry knows the right way of
[1:40:05] approach
[1:40:06] so much Ministry today that is savior of
[1:40:09] God but they don't know the right way of
[1:40:11] approach
[1:40:12] they don't know how to bring the people
[1:40:13] into an approach
[1:40:16] and the approach that God has provided
[1:40:19] for us today the world rejects it
[1:40:22] they've got their own approach to God
[1:40:26] that God in his ministry provided an
[1:40:29] approach that man could come and talk
[1:40:33] with him
[1:40:37] amen
[1:40:39] God doesn't talk
[1:40:42] to people just because they got to find
[1:40:44] choirs in the professional music
[1:40:48] and you say man
[1:40:51] brother Brown said see
[1:40:53] he wrapped that bloody skin around Adam
[1:40:56] and throughout the welcome carpet for
[1:40:58] him to walk back on the carpet of
[1:41:00] redemption
[1:41:02] he said God's God always had a Plan of
[1:41:05] Redemption and that's been through the
[1:41:06] blood ever since the very beginning and
[1:41:09] Dawn Of Time perceived in the mind of
[1:41:11] God before the world ever come into
[1:41:13] existence
[1:41:15] another place he said when Jesus died he
[1:41:17] cleansed all the world of sin by his
[1:41:20] blood
[1:41:22] so the ministry has blood can you say
[1:41:26] amen he said that's the reason they can
[1:41:28] have Rock and rolls and all kinds of
[1:41:31] vulgar in the world tonight and God
[1:41:33] doesn't take their life or skip the
[1:41:35] world of all is because that blood is a
[1:41:38] laying on The Mercy Seat but one of
[1:41:41] these days that blood's coming off The
[1:41:43] Mercy Seat then it's judgment
[1:41:48] he said I don't know it may be off
[1:41:50] before that clock hits and it gets 9 30.
[1:41:52] I don't know but she'll be dark then and
[1:41:56] there'll be nothing but judgment you've
[1:41:58] passed your own judgment with the
[1:42:00] attitude you've taken toward his son and
[1:42:03] the atonement
[1:42:06] that's right that's good
[1:42:11] Prophet goes on to talking about it and
[1:42:13] I'll get red clothes
[1:42:15] but when Adam and Eve started walking
[1:42:17] out of the garden there was a cloud over
[1:42:19] them
[1:42:21] sin hung over their brow
[1:42:24] s of Darkness hung all around them after
[1:42:27] they had received word of the Eternal
[1:42:29] destination
[1:42:32] they walked out of the garden with those
[1:42:34] bloody sheepskins around them
[1:42:38] here they were having the cloud of
[1:42:40] Darkness
[1:42:42] here they were feeling so wretched and
[1:42:45] miserable
[1:42:46] any any true Christian
[1:42:49] when they sinned there's just something
[1:42:50] there that they feel that's just
[1:42:53] something not right
[1:42:55] it's just something wrong
[1:42:58] you can imagine that weighed upon them
[1:43:01] as a walking out
[1:43:04] but then the prophet said as they're
[1:43:05] walking with that cloud of Darkness over
[1:43:08] them
[1:43:09] they had a ray of Hope
[1:43:12] that there was coming a redeemer
[1:43:15] God wouldn't finish his ministry yet
[1:43:19] but he would tell them okay
[1:43:22] I'm going to send you out now the
[1:43:23] prophet would tell us and he describes
[1:43:25] it he says I can see Adam and Eve
[1:43:27] walking through the garden with her head
[1:43:29] hanging down he's got his arms around
[1:43:32] her and are sobbing as they're walking
[1:43:34] in the the bloody sheepskin is flapping
[1:43:37] on their thighs blood running down their
[1:43:40] legs as they walk in house sobbing and
[1:43:44] God as they're going this way God's
[1:43:46] going that way and he's walking and he
[1:43:49] says all of a sudden God turns around
[1:43:51] and says stop
[1:43:53] wait
[1:43:54] wait
[1:43:56] he said I know you got to go
[1:43:59] he said I want you to know I'm going to
[1:44:01] provide a redeemer for you
[1:44:03] I'll provide something for you and he
[1:44:05] said what stop God l o v e
[1:44:10] can you say Amen
[1:44:12] see God's everlasting love God's eternal
[1:44:15] love that could not stop because of
[1:44:18] their fallen condition it provided a
[1:44:21] Ministry for them can you say amen and
[1:44:24] in that Ministry would come a redeemer
[1:44:26] in through that Ministry would come
[1:44:29] salvation through that Ministry was a
[1:44:32] ray of Hope For The Sinner can you say
[1:44:34] amen and I tell you tonight there's a
[1:44:36] Ministry on the earth that is still
[1:44:38] providing a ray of Hope for every
[1:44:41] backslider for every person that is in
[1:44:44] their Valley for every lost son and
[1:44:47] daughter husband and wife there is a
[1:44:49] Ministry that is provided for blood can
[1:44:54] you say Amen the prophet said to the
[1:44:56] preaching of the Gospel provides a blood
[1:44:58] Veil
[1:45:01] do you believe it
[1:45:05] God provided
[1:45:07] a redeemer
[1:45:10] it would take the ministry of God
[1:45:13] to provide such a thing
[1:45:16] you love him
[1:45:19] let's just sing this song as the
[1:45:21] musicians come
[1:45:23] Oh How
[1:45:25] He Loves You and Me me
[1:45:33] oh how
