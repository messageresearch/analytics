[34:42] It's good to be back in service. Good to
[34:44] have air conditioned. I think everybody
[34:46] can say amen to that. You know, there's
[34:49] so many wonderful things about
[34:51] Revelation, but there's many, many
[34:53] wonderful things about Revelation, but
[34:56] one thing I really like about
[34:57] Revelation, Revelation takes away fear.
[35:01] Revelation takes away fear. In this
[35:04] society today, Leodysy, the end of all
[35:06] things, Israel, the wars, all going on,
[35:09] we're so close. Revelation takes away
[35:12] fear. Remember the first time you ever
[35:16] heard future home? That was such a
[35:18] blessing to me uh key.
[35:24] Now the Lord has come in spirit form to
[35:27] open up the word. He took the book. He
[35:30] loosen seals the thunders that we have
[35:32] heard. The stimulation by the word to
[35:36] know that I am sealed. It makes me shout
[35:40] and move about the joy that I now feel.
[35:43] Well, the prophet preached a paradox.
[35:46] And standing in the gap, he told us in
[35:50] the time the sword did loose the cap,
[35:53] the written word beneath the rock. He
[35:56] told us what it said. A little squeeze
[36:00] to try our faith, but glory lays ahead.
[36:03] Oh yes, the Holy Ghost will set your
[36:06] feet a dancing.
[36:08] Oh, the Holy Ghost will through you
[36:10] through and through.
[36:13] I said the Holy Ghost will set your feet
[36:16] a dancing.
[36:18] He'll set your heart a dancing too.
[36:23] Well, now the joy we know, the end is
[36:25] here. The thunders they did say, the
[36:28] rapture call, the Lord's descent, the
[36:31] shout that day was made. That body
[36:34] waiting over there. I heard it calling
[36:37] me. The prophet said, "This day we've
[36:40] heard from our theophony."
[36:43] Oh, the Holy Ghost will set your feet a
[36:46] dancing.
[36:48] Oh, the Holy Ghost will thrill you
[36:50] through and through.
[36:52] I said the Holy Ghost will set your feet
[36:55] a dancing.
[36:57] Yes, he'll set your heart a dancing,
[37:00] too. Now, listen to this. Well, we're
[37:03] going to a place prepared, he said in
[37:06] future home. Let not your hearts be
[37:09] troubled now for never more to Rome. The
[37:13] joy bells are ringing loud. We're
[37:15] singing round the throne. The king and
[37:18] queen has closed the book now in our
[37:21] future home. Oh, the Holy Ghost will set

[40:50] Amen. Aren't you glad that you have the
[40:52] opportunity to serve him? Amen. To love
[40:56] him and to give him honor. And we could
[41:00] be in other places giving our time, our
[41:05] heart to other things.
[41:07] but so glad that he's called us. Amen.
[41:12] Well, good morning. It's good to be here
[41:14] in the house of the Lord. And uh the
[41:18] musicians can
[41:20] uh be dismissed and
[41:23] um tell you what, it's um when you uh
[41:27] aren't able to meet um
[41:31] you having to go from building to
[41:32] building, it's kind of nice when you get
[41:34] back home. Amen.
[41:37] As we say, there's nothing like home.
[41:39] Amen. And uh so uh but we really
[41:44] appreciate um uh brother Mark and
[41:47] brother Bill for their labors and they
[41:50] got up I think well they got here at
[41:52] 5:30 in the morning Friday and Saturday
[41:57] and uh uh to try to get it to work. And
[42:01] so, um, we really, really appreciate
[42:05] their efforts and labor and, um, and I
[42:09] know, uh, believe the Lord will bless
[42:11] them for that as well. Lord, and, um,
[42:16] um, it's just, uh, good to be among the
[42:19] bride of Christ. Um, before I forget,
[42:23] we're going to have communion, the Lord
[42:25] willing, next Sunday. And, uh, so we
[42:28] want to remember that. And um also we're
[42:32] going to u have a baptism after service
[42:36] this morning. And so uh uh Levi had uh
[42:41] asked me the other day. He said, "Dad,
[42:43] can I get baptized?" And so uh we sat
[42:47] down and explained it to him and and uh
[42:50] so Lord willing um we're going to be uh
[42:54] baptizing him. Amen. And so, um, glad
[42:58] the Lord still deals with our youth.
[43:02] Amen. And, and I know they're they're
[43:04] part of this this gospel and this
[43:07] rapture and, uh, as well. Amen. And so,
[43:12] uh, we just thank the Lord for that. Um,
[43:16] if you have your Bibles, we're going to
[43:17] turn to the book of John,
[43:21] the first chapter.
[43:23] really enjoyed the songs and the
[43:25] specials. Um, and um like hearing uh
[43:31] both songs. Uh my wife sung and and
[43:34] brother Terry uh sung. Did you write
[43:37] them verses, brother Terry? Man, you're
[43:39] a you're a songwriter. Amen. I enjoyed
[43:42] that very much. And so, um I wished I
[43:47] was a songwriter. Both my brothers are
[43:49] songwriters. and
[43:52] the only song I wrote kind of a rap song
[43:56] and about me and my brother and so um um
[44:01] anyway that's as far as I gotten in
[44:03] writing songs
[44:05] it was a carnal moment you know and so u
[44:11] uh but we I ain't got the gift so amen
[44:16] but uh we can just bow our heads in a
[44:19] word a prayer and ask the Lord to be
[44:22] with us. Father,
[44:25] we just thank you for making a way that
[44:28] we could come
[44:30] back and gather in to our church
[44:34] building here, Father, that you blessed
[44:36] us with. And Lord, um thinking of just
[44:41] many people um here in America and
[44:46] gatherings and and around the world that
[44:49] don't have a place to call their own.
[44:53] And uh we just thank you, Lord. And just
[44:56] ask a special blessing on brother Mark
[44:58] and brother Bill as they worked so hard
[45:01] to get this running for us. And and
[45:04] Lord, now we're just asking that you
[45:07] would be with us this morning in this
[45:09] part of the service, Father, we realize
[45:12] that your word is the most important
[45:14] thing to us. And Father, but we can't
[45:18] understand it on our own. It takes you
[45:20] to open the words and explain it to us
[45:24] and reveal it to us. And we pray that
[45:27] you would do it today, Father. Father,
[45:30] forgive us of all of our sins, our
[45:32] failures, and Lord, cover us with your
[45:35] blood today is our prayer. In Jesus
[45:39] Christ's name we ask it. And the church
[45:41] says, "Amen." And amen. Uh
[45:47] John, St. John 1 and um 11 and 12
[45:55] it says he came unto his own and his own
[45:59] received him not
[46:02] but as many as received him to them gave
[46:06] he power to become the sons of God even
[46:11] to them that believe on his name. Amen.
[46:17] Then if you'll turn first Thessalonians
[46:22] um the 2 chapter
[46:25] 1 Thessalonians chapter 2
[46:34] and
[46:36] the 13th verse
[46:40] it says for this cause
[46:42] also thank we God without ceasing
[46:45] because when ye receive received the
[46:47] word of God,
[46:49] which you've heard of us. You received
[46:53] it not as the word of men, but as it is
[46:57] in truth, the word of God, which
[47:01] effectively, everybody say, effectively
[47:05] workketh also in you that believe. Amen.
[47:12] You can be seated this morning. And um
[47:17] um if I have a title, it would be
[47:22] receiving the word for our day. And I
[47:26] spoke on this uh thought um Wednesday
[47:29] night.
[47:31] And uh so I want to just continue with
[47:34] it. Um,
[47:37] we we know the word of God is important
[47:40] and the message teaches us that the word
[47:44] of God is life. It's the Bible teaches
[47:47] us that, but it's it's none other than
[47:51] God himself.
[47:53] And um, no person can fully benefit from
[47:59] the word of God
[48:02] um, as God intended.
[48:05] uh without receiving it. So uh
[48:10] a person's got to receive it in order to
[48:15] uh find the full benefits of the word of
[48:20] God.
[48:22] And uh the word of God is is a promise
[48:26] to us. Ain't that right?
[48:29] uh uh God, he doesn't just speak things
[48:33] just off the top of his head and then
[48:36] regrets it later or uh speaks it and
[48:39] then takes it back and speaks it without
[48:42] having any intentions to fulfill it. But
[48:46] God is determined to fulfill his word.
[48:48] He's determined. So when he speaks his
[48:51] word, he can speak it not as though in
[48:55] past tense but speaks it in future tense
[48:59] knowing that it will be fulfilled.
[49:02] So God promised to heal. He promised to
[49:05] save. He promised to deliver. He
[49:08] promised to protect and to provide. And
[49:12] being that this is his word, we can find
[49:15] it all uh his promises in the in the
[49:18] Bible. And and so these are promises. We
[49:22] don't we don't have to wonder if God
[49:25] will heal us. We don't we don't don't
[49:27] have to question God's intentions to
[49:29] save or to deliver or whatever. This is
[49:32] his promise to us. Uh that that he will
[49:36] do these things. Uh eternal life is a
[49:40] promise.
[49:41] uh that way we we can't look at it and
[49:45] God doesn't want us looking at it as
[49:47] well you know I have eternal life today
[49:49] but I don't know about tomorrow you know
[49:51] no God was determined to give you
[49:54] eternal life and and so that that's a
[49:57] promise it he never changes his mind
[50:00] being changed from corruption to
[50:02] incorruption that that is a promise it's
[50:05] it's the word of God living with him
[50:07] eternally living in in a new city um uh
[50:12] and and uh reigning with him. That's a
[50:15] promise. There's so many promises in in
[50:18] this Bible that God made. And so when we
[50:21] look at the word of God, it we we must
[50:24] see it as a promise. Amen. It's it's
[50:27] it's no other book like it. Um uh
[50:31] because this holds the promises of God.
[50:34] Ain't that right? And it's not mixed
[50:37] with man's ideas or man's opinion. This
[50:40] is solemnly the word of God and every
[50:43] word of God is is a promise and and so
[50:47] we can take it for that. So when God
[50:50] makes a promise, he leaves no room for
[50:53] error. Uh it's it's a promise and and
[50:58] that's there there's no error in that.
[51:00] God can't change. God can't take it
[51:02] back. The Bible says God cannot lie.
[51:05] Ain't that right? So you don't have to
[51:07] question whether it will happen or not.
[51:10] It's it's just a promise. God's going to
[51:13] do it. God meant what he said. How many
[51:16] believes that? Amen. So the word of God
[51:20] is a declaration of his will. If you
[51:24] want to know the will of God, then then
[51:27] you can read it in the word of God. And
[51:30] and his promise is his will uh today.
[51:34] Ain't that right? that is is made known
[51:36] and it reveals what God has predestined
[51:40] to be. Amen. And so I'm glad for that.
[51:44] He didn't just say, "Well, I'm going to
[51:46] to uh uh save Branson," but uh and and
[51:51] and but he's already got it his his path
[51:54] already lined out. Amen. And he he says,
[51:58] well, the Bible says whom he called, he
[52:01] uh uh justified, and whom he justified,
[52:04] he already uh uh glorified. And so,
[52:08] y'all know the scripture, but uh God
[52:11] already done that all the way through.
[52:14] Amen. And that's a promise, ain't that
[52:17] right. So we we find Ephesians 1:11,
[52:21] Paul says that he workketh all things
[52:24] after the council of his own will.
[52:28] Everything that is going on today, you
[52:31] can actually find it in in the Bible
[52:34] because this is his will to us and he's
[52:38] working all things after the counsel of
[52:41] his will. Ain't that right? Amen. the
[52:44] specific trial that you're going
[52:45] through. It may not be in in uh spelled
[52:49] out in the Bible for you uh per se, but
[52:52] you can look in here and know that
[52:54] that's working according to his will in
[52:58] in the Bible. Ain't that right? Amen.
[53:00] See, so nothing works apart from uh from
[53:05] his his will. Amen. So then if God's
[53:09] word is a promise, Amen. Then we have to
[53:13] receive it as a promise. We we have to
[53:16] receive it. Um uh um you know you you
[53:20] can't you can't accept this as an
[53:22] opinion. We we we don't receive the word
[53:26] as just uh just a common thought as
[53:29] though man spoke it. We have to receive
[53:32] it as God spoke it. And it's God's
[53:35] promise to us. Ain't that right? So
[53:38] that's what the word of God must mean to
[53:40] us. It's a promise and it cannot fail.
[53:42] It's going to happen. Amen. So then when
[53:46] God uh reveals to you that his word
[53:50] speaks of you, then then you have to
[53:53] receive it in that way. If if God's if
[53:57] if this Bible is is speaks of you and
[54:00] and uh uh well, you say, "Well, my
[54:02] name's not in it." But see, when God
[54:04] reveals it, Amen. It's a personal
[54:07] revelation that these promises are for
[54:09] you. Then you have to receive it not as
[54:13] though it is in general, but you receive
[54:16] it as a personal promise. Amen. To me,
[54:20] ain't that right? To you. Amen. That's
[54:23] the way God wants us to know the word.
[54:25] He wants us to know it personally. not
[54:29] not in memorization that you've read the
[54:31] Bible and you can you can know verse uh
[54:34] chapter and verse and know where it's
[54:36] defined it and all that. But he wants
[54:38] you to know it as a personal promise to
[54:43] you that that if he's not speaking to
[54:46] anybody else, he spoke to me. It's my
[54:49] promise. It's it's it's what I'm
[54:51] claiming. And that's the way Jesus knew
[54:54] the word. Amen. See, the prophet says he
[54:57] knew that he was predestinated.
[55:01] He was the lamb slain before the
[55:04] foundation of the world. He knowed he
[55:07] was that person. Ain't that right? He
[55:10] knowed it. Amen. See, and so he says,
[55:14] "Oh, brother, he that hath an ear, let
[55:16] him hear." He knowed that he was
[55:19] predestinated for that. And that's the
[55:22] way he knew the word. That's the way he
[55:25] received the promise is not looking for
[55:27] somebody else to fulfill it. He knew he
[55:30] was the one to fulfill it. And that's
[55:33] the way we receive the word. Amen. That
[55:36] if uh uh uh if he died for no one but
[55:39] me, then it's for me. Amen. What he died
[55:43] for, I was part of that. Amen. See? And
[55:47] so, uh, God expects us, the prophet
[55:50] said, God expects us to receive his word
[55:54] when he sends it, when God anoints. See,
[55:57] and so the way to receive the word is to
[56:01] believe the word. Ain't that right?
[56:03] Don't argue with it. Don't question it.
[56:05] Don't don't wonder about it. Just just
[56:08] believe the word. You may not understand
[56:10] it. Believe the word. You may not see it
[56:13] all. You may not see the whole picture.
[56:15] Just believe the word. And as you
[56:17] believe the word, you receive the word.
[56:20] Can you say amen? You don't receive it
[56:22] by wisdom. Now, you're not receiving the
[56:24] word by man's wisdom, by your own
[56:26] understanding, and and your own thoughts
[56:29] about it. Brother Brham said, when you
[56:31] try to figure it out and try to find God
[56:34] by wisdom, you're going further from him
[56:37] all the time. See, you're trying to
[56:39] understand it. Well, there's no way of
[56:41] doing it. Just accept it. Somebody say
[56:43] just accept it. See, just accept it.
[56:46] Just believe it. Don't try to understand
[56:49] it. He said, "I can't understand." Uh,
[56:51] you know, a lot of things. There's not
[56:53] many things that I do understand or
[56:55] can't understand. I can't understand how
[56:58] this young fella, he says, sitting here
[57:01] eats the same food I can. Here he is.
[57:04] Got a full head of hair. He says, "I
[57:06] ain't got any. I don't understand it.
[57:08] They tell me calcium makes it. I can't
[57:10] keep my fingernails cut off enough and
[57:12] and no hair at all to cut off. See, he
[57:15] said, "I don't understand that." See,
[57:17] but he said, "As the old saying goes, he
[57:20] says uh uh uh he says, you know, how
[57:24] that a black cow can eat green grass and
[57:26] give white milk and turn yellow butter."
[57:29] He said, "I can't understand that. I
[57:31] can't explain it." See, he said,
[57:33] "Because each uh you see, each one is a
[57:36] product of of the other one." He says,
[57:39] "But how does it do it? Can't explain
[57:41] it. Can't explain how two liies stand or
[57:44] two flowers of the same breed, one red
[57:47] and the other one yellow, one brown, one
[57:49] blue. I don't understand it. The same
[57:52] sun shines upon them." Well, where does
[57:54] the color come from? Well, I can't
[57:56] explain it. But yet, you have to accept
[57:59] it. Ain't that right? Well, that's the
[58:01] way the Bible is. this Bible, it it
[58:04] would seem such contradictory at times
[58:06] and and it seemed just uh uh uh the the
[58:10] greatest minds have tried to understand
[58:13] every part of this Bible, but you just
[58:16] have to accept it for what it is. Ain't
[58:19] that right? So now we know as the
[58:22] prophet taught us in the beginning a uh
[58:24] that God allotted his word to each age,
[58:27] a portion of his word to each age. And
[58:30] he says there is a portion of word laid
[58:32] for every age and there is some
[58:35] anointing comes down and projects that
[58:38] portion of word for that age. Ain't that
[58:41] right? So so God makes that word known
[58:45] through his servants, his prophets.
[58:48] Amen. And the prophet said the way a
[58:51] prophet is known is that when he
[58:53] prophesies, Amen. when he prophesies a
[58:56] thing, that thing comes to pass. Then
[58:59] you know, amen that is the a a a
[59:03] prophet. Ain't that right? Amen. See,
[59:06] now we needed a prophet to bring the
[59:08] word of God to us in this age as as we
[59:12] know. Amen. Why? So that we could live.
[59:15] Amen. And and uh uh uh because only the
[59:21] word for our day and I want to say that
[59:23] again. Only the word for our day is
[59:26] effective. Amen. to to us. Amen. It it's
[59:31] it's it's it's the only way. It's the
[59:33] only thing that can be effective. Ain't
[59:35] that right? This is why the word of God
[59:38] is so important. The message of the hour
[59:40] is so important today. Amen. And just
[59:44] kind of going through some things here.
[59:46] But uh the the prophet would would uh uh
[59:49] taught us is that you know if Moses
[59:52] would have come preaching uh uh uh
[59:54] Noah's message, well then it wouldn't
[59:56] have worked. Ain't that right? If Moses,
[59:59] now think of it. If he, now Noah had the
[1:00:02] word, but if Moses years later would
[1:00:05] have come preaching the same word that
[1:00:07] Noah preached, well then it wouldn't
[1:00:09] have worked. If John the Baptist came
[1:00:11] preaching Moses's message, it wouldn't
[1:00:14] have had any effect. Ain't that right?
[1:00:16] If Jesus would have come preaching uh uh
[1:00:19] Noah's message and Moses's message and
[1:00:22] and uh Elijah's message and and all well
[1:00:26] it it wouldn't have worked. See? Amen.
[1:00:29] Well, so so brother Brown says we
[1:00:31] haven't got Sanki's message. We haven't
[1:00:35] got Moody's message. We've got the
[1:00:38] message of the hour. Can you say amen?
[1:00:42] We've got the message of the hour. We
[1:00:44] haven't got Luther's message or Wesley's
[1:00:47] message. They had a message. They had
[1:00:50] part of the word, but we've got
[1:00:52] something different. We've got something
[1:00:54] greater. Something something that would
[1:00:56] be effective to us in this age. Yes.
[1:00:59] Luther's message affected the elect in
[1:01:02] his age. Wesley's message affected the
[1:01:05] the elect in in his age. And so is it
[1:01:09] the same for this day. Amen. See, so
[1:01:13] they were all right, he says. But this
[1:01:16] is another day. This is another promise.
[1:01:18] This is another church age. Jesus Christ
[1:01:22] the same yesterday, today, and forever.
[1:01:25] Ain't that right? See, so if you needed
[1:01:28] to hear another message, amen, a a
[1:01:32] previous message outside of this age,
[1:01:34] God by wisdom, knowing this, he would
[1:01:38] have set you in the time of Noah or me
[1:01:41] uh Moses or in the time of Paul or or
[1:01:46] whatever. Ain't that right? Amen. But
[1:01:48] God ordained you to live in this age.
[1:01:52] And he ordained a word for this age to
[1:01:56] be effective to you and I. Ain't that
[1:02:00] right? I find it interesting, you know,
[1:02:02] to hear uh uh people say, well, you
[1:02:06] know, they believe the Bible and yet
[1:02:08] they refuse to believe the word for the
[1:02:11] day that we live in. Amen. And they
[1:02:14] readily accept the fact that Noah's
[1:02:17] message was right. Amen. Uh most most uh
[1:02:21] most people amen uh accept today that
[1:02:25] Noah's message was right. Amen. Well,
[1:02:28] what was his message? God was going to
[1:02:30] flood the world. God was going to send
[1:02:32] judgment upon the earth. Amen. And that
[1:02:36] God had provided an ark of safety. Well,
[1:02:40] the people in that day didn't didn't
[1:02:43] believe the message that Noah brought.
[1:02:45] Amen. And they laughed at it. They
[1:02:47] sculpted at it. They they they treated
[1:02:50] it lightly and they perished. Ain't that
[1:02:52] right? But people today look back and
[1:02:55] say, "Oh, that message is right. We'll
[1:02:57] accept that." Amen. But but see, that
[1:03:00] message does you no good today. It it it
[1:03:03] to receive that message, yes, we believe
[1:03:06] it. But but for that message to be
[1:03:08] effective to us, well, it it's not going
[1:03:11] to be effective. Amen. Because God isn't
[1:03:15] going to send the a flood. Uh he's not
[1:03:18] going to flood the world today. Amen.
[1:03:20] He's not going to uh send water upon the
[1:03:23] earth by uh through his judgments and
[1:03:26] things. He's not providing a a natural
[1:03:29] ark as as it was in Moses or Noah's day.
[1:03:34] Ain't that right? See, people today
[1:03:37] would uh readily accept uh uh Moses's
[1:03:41] message. Amen. Uh as being the truth.
[1:03:45] Amen. See, but the problem is God God
[1:03:49] isn't bringing his people out of a
[1:03:51] natural land. He He's He's not providing
[1:03:55] a natural token, a natural blood. Amen.
[1:03:59] Uh he's not taking them, Amen. out of a
[1:04:02] natural land into a into a natural land
[1:04:06] as he did under Moses's message. Can you
[1:04:09] say amen? So then that message wouldn't
[1:04:12] work for us today. Amen. See, many
[1:04:16] people today gladly receive Jesus's
[1:04:19] message as being the truth. They see him
[1:04:22] as being the lamb of God. They see him
[1:04:25] as the redeemer. They see him as the the
[1:04:28] Messiah coming to take the away the sins
[1:04:31] of the world. And and they accept the
[1:04:34] fact that he fulfilled all the types of
[1:04:37] the Old Testament that that spoke of uh
[1:04:41] that spoke of him. They see him as uh uh
[1:04:46] God being in a man, a man. See, and uh
[1:04:50] but but he isn't he isn't coming to take
[1:04:54] away the sins of the world today. He he
[1:04:57] isn't going and being a sacrifice and
[1:05:00] and uh being our sacrifice and walking
[1:05:03] up Calvary to atone for the sins of the
[1:05:06] world today. Can you say amen? Amen.
[1:05:09] See? So, so then that word wouldn't work
[1:05:13] for today. Amen. See, and and uh uh uh
[1:05:18] then we we find that the scriptures have
[1:05:21] never promised, as the prophet would
[1:05:23] tell us, the scriptures never promised
[1:05:25] that Jesus would come uh to earth again
[1:05:29] in his physical body before the rapture
[1:05:32] takes place. Ain't that right? So then,
[1:05:35] he isn't coming as the lamb of God. He
[1:05:38] isn't going to die again. The first time
[1:05:40] the prophet said, the first time Jesus
[1:05:42] come, he come to redeem his bride. Amen.
[1:05:46] And that was the message. See? Amen. But
[1:05:49] today, the second time he comes, he's
[1:05:51] coming to catch his bride, to come to
[1:05:55] get his bride. Can you say amen? See, so
[1:05:58] uh uh we can preach about him uh coming
[1:06:01] to redeem, and we can preach about him
[1:06:04] coming to die, but that's not the word
[1:06:06] for us today. That's not the message,
[1:06:09] amen, that we have today. Ain't that
[1:06:11] right? For John 14:16, Jesus says, "And
[1:06:15] I will pray the Father, and he shall
[1:06:17] give you another comforter that he may
[1:06:20] abide with you forever, even the Spirit
[1:06:23] of truth, whom the world cannot receive,
[1:06:25] because it receiveth him not." Can you
[1:06:28] say, "Amen? It seeth him not. It neither
[1:06:31] knows him, but you know him." Amen.
[1:06:34] Aren't you glad for that? you know him
[1:06:38] for he dwelleth with you and shall be in
[1:06:41] you. Can you say amen? So we're not
[1:06:44] preaching a a God in a corporal body
[1:06:47] today in the physical body of 2,000
[1:06:49] years ago. Even though we believe all of
[1:06:52] that, we believe we will see him. But
[1:06:54] that's not the message for today. Amen.
[1:06:57] He's on earth today. And you can't find
[1:06:59] him in that physical body of 2,000 years
[1:07:03] ago. But he promised I shall be in you.
[1:07:07] Can you say amen? I will not leave you
[1:07:09] comfortless. I will come to you. Yet a
[1:07:12] little while while and the world seeth
[1:07:14] me no more. But you see me because I
[1:07:17] live you shall live also. At that day
[1:07:20] you shall know that I'm in my father and
[1:07:22] you in me and I in you. Can you say
[1:07:27] amen? That's right. See Matthew 23:39.
[1:07:31] For I say unto you, Jesus says, you
[1:07:34] shall not see me henceforth, till you
[1:07:37] shall say, blessed is he that cometh in
[1:07:41] the name of the Lord. Can you say amen?
[1:07:44] Blessed is he that cometh in the name of
[1:07:47] the Lord. Amen. John 8:24, Jesus says,
[1:07:50] "If you believe not that I am he, you
[1:07:53] shall die in your sins." Ain't that
[1:07:57] right? See, so now the prophet would
[1:08:00] tell us Jesus Christ provided a church.
[1:08:04] Aren't you glad for that? Amen. In this
[1:08:08] age, he's not providing a literal ark.
[1:08:11] In this age, he's not providing a
[1:08:14] literal uh blood of a natural lamb.
[1:08:18] Amen. See? Amen. But he's provided a
[1:08:21] church for the unbelievers that they
[1:08:24] could come in and see the manifestation
[1:08:28] of his resurrection and know beyond a
[1:08:31] shadow of a doubt that he has rose from
[1:08:33] the dead. Can you say amen? So it's in
[1:08:36] this age God is not providing a physical
[1:08:40] literal body. Amen. That was of 2,000
[1:08:43] years ago that he lived in. Amen. to
[1:08:46] walk the earth and to show see I'm risen
[1:08:49] from the dead. No, the message is it's
[1:08:51] Christ in you, the hope of glory. You
[1:08:54] are the one that the world will see that
[1:08:57] he has risen from the dead. God provided
[1:09:00] a church in this age. Amen. To show that
[1:09:04] he has risen. Can you say amen? If the
[1:09:07] world wants to see it, if the world and
[1:09:10] and I say to you, the world is without
[1:09:12] excuse. Amen. Because he's got people.
[1:09:15] He's got children. He's got uh uh
[1:09:17] grandpas and grandmas and uh preachers
[1:09:21] and co-workers and bosses and employees
[1:09:24] and and all this thing. He's got them
[1:09:27] scattered throughout the world and that
[1:09:29] is a part of his church that they can
[1:09:32] see that Jesus Christ is the same
[1:09:36] yesterday, today, and forever. He's not
[1:09:38] a God of history. He's a God that is
[1:09:41] present today. See? So he says Jesus
[1:09:45] rose from the dead making a provided way
[1:09:49] for whosoever will might look and live.
[1:09:53] But if you refuse to look, how can you
[1:09:56] do anything but die? Jesus said, "If you
[1:09:58] don't believe that I am he, you will die
[1:10:01] in your sin." Can you say amen? Amen.
[1:10:04] You say, "Well, I believe that he is. I
[1:10:06] I believe that's him of 2,000 years ago.
[1:10:09] But what about him today? He provided a
[1:10:13] body for today. That's the message of
[1:10:15] the hour. Can you say amen? Is God's got
[1:10:19] a body. Amen. Today,
[1:10:23] in every age, when God sent his word by
[1:10:27] way of a prophet, the critics rose up
[1:10:30] and tried to prove him wrong. Moses had
[1:10:34] his critics. Elijah had his critics.
[1:10:36] Jeremiah,
[1:10:38] Noah, Moses,
[1:10:41] John the Baptist, Jesus,
[1:10:43] you know, and and yet they they claim to
[1:10:46] believe uh the message of another day.
[1:10:51] And Jesus critics claim to believe
[1:10:54] Moses, the message of another day. and
[1:10:58] and they are the ones, it was the
[1:11:01] critics, the ones that killed the
[1:11:03] prophets that God sent to them in their
[1:11:06] day. And in Matthew 23:29,
[1:11:11] Jesus said to his critics, "Woe unto you
[1:11:13] scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites,
[1:11:16] because you build the tombs of the
[1:11:18] prophets and garnish the scepters of the
[1:11:21] righteous." See, of another day, right?
[1:11:25] not not the day they're living in, but
[1:11:27] of another day. They they're going to
[1:11:29] shine them tombs up. They're going to
[1:11:31] make them look pretty. Amen. They're
[1:11:33] going to Amen. Uh you know, uh uh uh uh
[1:11:37] make sure that lawn is just nice and and
[1:11:39] all of these things. Amen. Of the
[1:11:41] righteous and of the prophets and and
[1:11:43] these things. But they were of another
[1:11:45] day. And and and they say, "Well, if and
[1:11:49] and you say, if if we had been in the
[1:11:51] days of our fathers, we would not have
[1:11:54] been partakers with him in the blood of
[1:11:56] the prophets." See, in other words, we
[1:11:58] wouldn't have killed them. We we
[1:11:59] wouldn't have done that. We would have
[1:12:01] accepted that word that they brought.
[1:12:03] See, but he says, "Wherefore ye be
[1:12:06] witnesses unto yourselves that you are
[1:12:08] the children of them which killed the
[1:12:10] prophets." Amen. In other words, you're
[1:12:13] of the same lineage. You you you you you
[1:12:15] have the same character. You have the
[1:12:17] same attitude. You and and they prove
[1:12:20] what Jesus said to them by cruing the
[1:12:22] very word of their day.
[1:12:26] Can you say amen? Crucifying the word.
[1:12:28] See, so this message has its own critics
[1:12:31] too.
[1:12:32] They have their websites, their books
[1:12:34] and their videos and arguments and their
[1:12:38] churches and these things and and they
[1:12:41] they they say that the message is wrong.
[1:12:44] Amen. Because there is no proof of what
[1:12:46] brother Brandham said is true. Brother
[1:12:49] Bram talks about the 16 men falling off
[1:12:52] the bridge. Well, they ain't got no
[1:12:53] proof. They've tried to look for that
[1:12:55] proof. They ain't got no proof, so they
[1:12:56] say it's wrong. Amen. And brother Ram
[1:12:59] tells the stories and historical events
[1:13:01] that have happened in his own ministry
[1:13:03] and and or or by visions that he saw and
[1:13:07] and things like that. See, and and so uh
[1:13:10] because they have no proof that what he
[1:13:12] said is right, then they've come to the
[1:13:14] conclusion that he is a liar and that
[1:13:17] the message is false and and that he was
[1:13:19] only a deceiver. Ain't that right? See,
[1:13:22] and and and so uh uh they they invest
[1:13:25] their time and their energy pointing out
[1:13:28] all, you know, uh uh what they see as
[1:13:32] brother Brandham's opinions. Amen. and
[1:13:35] and so then they they they want to make
[1:13:37] sure that the the people are balanced or
[1:13:40] congregations are balanced and uh uh by
[1:13:43] by by pointing out the the the opinions
[1:13:46] of brother Brandham and and this may be
[1:13:48] right and you you you understand it it's
[1:13:51] there and and then they use their time
[1:13:54] uh uh uh spend their time pointing out
[1:13:56] to the people that brother Brandham was
[1:13:59] only a man and and and you know uh
[1:14:02] really wants to make sure that everybody
[1:14:04] understands understands that. See that
[1:14:06] brother Brandon was just a man. Yet
[1:14:08] these same people say, Amen, that they
[1:14:10] believe that God created Adam and Eve
[1:14:13] and and that Eve was taken out of of
[1:14:16] Adam's side, but they have no proof that
[1:14:20] that happened. Amen. They say they
[1:14:22] believe that Jesus walked upon the
[1:14:24] water. They have no proof that that
[1:14:26] happened. See, they say that they
[1:14:29] believe that the axe head swam that the
[1:14:31] Old Testament spoke of. And and yet they
[1:14:34] have no proof that that actually
[1:14:37] happened. They say that the three Hebrew
[1:14:39] boys went into the fiery furnace and
[1:14:41] that they believe that that they they
[1:14:43] went in there and they came out
[1:14:45] unscathed, unharmed. And yet they have
[1:14:47] no proof. They have no proof. Amen. And
[1:14:51] and there's no eyewitnesses living today
[1:14:54] that saw them things happen. Amen.
[1:14:57] There's no proof of it and they seek no
[1:15:00] proof. Ain't that amazing? a word of
[1:15:03] another day. They require no proof of
[1:15:05] it. They just say, "We believe it. We
[1:15:07] accept it." It's it's, you know, it's
[1:15:09] it's the obvious thing that we would not
[1:15:12] be like like them in that day that
[1:15:14] rejected the word. Amen. Uh for their
[1:15:17] age, you understand? See? Amen. And and
[1:15:21] so uh how how do they really know that
[1:15:23] the the Red Sea opened up? Amen. And two
[1:15:27] and a half million people, Amen. did not
[1:15:30] have to wait for the sun to come out and
[1:15:32] dry the place up. Amen. But the they w
[1:15:35] started walking immediately. Amen. On
[1:15:38] dry ground. Amen. After the water had to
[1:15:42] had had parted. Amen. And yet they say
[1:15:45] they believe that and require no proof
[1:15:47] that it happened. Amen. Well, the first
[1:15:50] five books of the Bible was written by
[1:15:53] Moses. Ain't that right? Amen. Moses had
[1:15:56] a temper. He was a murderer. Amen.
[1:15:58] murdered a man. He disobeyed God and was
[1:16:01] not permitted to go into the promised
[1:16:03] land because of his disobedience. Amen.
[1:16:06] And uh uh and and yet the people who
[1:16:10] make fun of the word of this day look
[1:16:13] back at that day and ready accept amen
[1:16:17] this Moses's writings as being the
[1:16:20] infallible truth. Can you say amen? And
[1:16:23] yet they don't know that Moses existed.
[1:16:25] They have no proof that Moses Amen. was
[1:16:28] actually vindicated by the supernatural.
[1:16:31] Amen. They just they say, "Well, we just
[1:16:33] believe it." You know, and and and they
[1:16:35] say, "We accept it. It's got to be
[1:16:37] true." See, and and you know, they never
[1:16:40] spend time looking at this Bible trying
[1:16:42] to convince us that Moses was just a
[1:16:44] man. They they never spend their time
[1:16:47] telling us that Moses's writings were
[1:16:50] mixed with his own opinions and and all
[1:16:53] that. And yet we know that Moses was a
[1:16:56] man with faults and and ups and downs,
[1:16:58] discouragements, running away from from
[1:17:01] his calling and and and all of these
[1:17:03] things. And yet they're not here trying
[1:17:05] to tell us. Amen. Now, y'all got to be
[1:17:08] careful and believe in what Moses's
[1:17:09] Moses wrote because some of that could
[1:17:12] be wrong and some of that could be his
[1:17:14] own opinions and and all of these
[1:17:16] things. Can you say amen? Amen. But see,
[1:17:18] we have eyewitnesses
[1:17:21] of what God has done in this day. Aren't
[1:17:24] you glad for those eyewitnesses? I love
[1:17:26] to hear the stories and of of of the men
[1:17:29] and the women that were around the
[1:17:31] prophet of God in this age. And I know
[1:17:34] people, you know, I've heard some
[1:17:36] preachers say, "I get tired of listening
[1:17:37] to all that." Well, I don't get tired of
[1:17:39] listening to that. Amen. because it
[1:17:41] tells me, amen, that God actually done
[1:17:44] something in this day and they were the
[1:17:46] eyewitnesses of it. We're not just
[1:17:48] reading a Bible of history. We are now
[1:17:52] hearing firthand accounts of what God
[1:17:55] has done in this day. Amen. See, we have
[1:17:59] scientific proof that bears witness that
[1:18:02] this message is the truth today. That's
[1:18:06] scientific proof. Can you say amen? God
[1:18:08] wasn't just wanting us to hear
[1:18:10] eyewitnesses and given get an eyewitness
[1:18:13] account of what God done. God wanted
[1:18:15] science to bear proof. Amen. That uh uh
[1:18:19] that he approves of this message. Amen.
[1:18:22] Can you say amen? And yet the people of
[1:18:25] today refuse to receive it. Amen. That's
[1:18:29] right. Why would a minister downplay the
[1:18:31] ministry of brother Brandham and then
[1:18:33] turn around and promote himself? Why
[1:18:36] would a minister tell his followers that
[1:18:38] Brother Brandham's teaching uh upon
[1:18:40] interracial marriage was just his
[1:18:42] opinion? Amen. You don't have to listen
[1:18:44] to that. Just stay with what the Bible
[1:18:46] says. Amen. Why would a minister tell
[1:18:48] his congregation that the message is
[1:18:51] like a tool? It's good when you need it.
[1:18:53] Uh but otherwise, you can just leave it
[1:18:55] up on the shelf. Amen. Why why would
[1:18:58] they do these things? is because there
[1:19:01] is unbelief that is there that they
[1:19:04] can't just accept the word for the way
[1:19:07] it says it. Can you say amen? That's
[1:19:10] right. It empowers them. See, it
[1:19:13] empowers them. If if they start bringing
[1:19:16] doubt in the message to the people,
[1:19:18] Amen. And the people all of a sudden
[1:19:20] start getting confused. Well, was this
[1:19:22] brother Brandham's opinion? Well, was
[1:19:24] this right or was this right? I don't
[1:19:27] know what to do now. Amen. Well, it
[1:19:29] empowers them to stand behind the pulpit
[1:19:32] and be the interpreter of the message.
[1:19:36] Can you say amen? Well, God doesn't need
[1:19:38] no one to interpret this message. He
[1:19:41] interpreted himself. Amen. By
[1:19:44] vindicating it. And that is enough
[1:19:47] interpretation for the believer. Can you
[1:19:50] say amen? Amen. See, see, so when the
[1:19:54] people's faith are weakened, Amen. then
[1:19:56] they cannot receive the word. Hello.
[1:20:01] That's right. Amen. Amen. See, I I like
[1:20:04] how brother Brandham now, he used a lot
[1:20:06] of the stories of the Bible. I mean,
[1:20:08] Brother Brandham used the stories of the
[1:20:10] Bible a lot. But what he was doing, he
[1:20:13] was showing that that same God that done
[1:20:16] it back then is still the God of today.
[1:20:18] Can you say amen? He wanted us to
[1:20:20] receive the same God that they had.
[1:20:23] Amen. And that way we can see God in the
[1:20:26] message
[1:20:29] and receive the message. Can you say
[1:20:31] amen? See, so now, Brother Brham says
[1:20:34] the word of God is like a prescription
[1:20:37] the doctor gives you. Any doctor must be
[1:20:41] very careful when he gives out the
[1:20:44] medication
[1:20:46] because if he don't
[1:20:49] well he could be given he could be
[1:20:51] giving you sulfuric acid thinking it's
[1:20:55] the thing that it's the right medicine.
[1:20:58] He could be giving you something and we
[1:21:00] we've heard reports of it. You know
[1:21:03] nurse give give the wrong kind of thing
[1:21:06] that she thought was the right thing.
[1:21:08] give it to the patient and and they die,
[1:21:11] right? We we've seen it. We've heard of
[1:21:14] these stories. See? Amen. So, he he
[1:21:17] could give you something that will kill
[1:21:18] you and not know it. See, and any
[1:21:22] minister giving out something that's
[1:21:24] contrary to the word of God is just like
[1:21:27] that doctor that gives out the wrong
[1:21:30] thing and kills his patient.
[1:21:34] Hello. See, then then then it's going to
[1:21:37] kill the congregation. It's going to
[1:21:38] kill the individual. A ain't that right.
[1:21:41] See, so then but if if a doctor that is
[1:21:44] making up the prescription, if if if he
[1:21:47] doesn't, you know, uh uh if he doesn't
[1:21:49] know what he's doing, he could put he
[1:21:52] could put uh uh uh too much poison in
[1:21:55] that prescription and it would kill you.
[1:21:58] Ain't that right? See, as the prophet
[1:22:00] tells us and and and uh the medical
[1:22:03] field, uh uh uh there's so much uh uh
[1:22:07] poison in the prescription to kill the
[1:22:10] germs. Amen. It's it's they're they're
[1:22:13] trying to attack that that sickness in
[1:22:17] your body. And so they've got to put
[1:22:20] just enough there uh poison not to kill
[1:22:23] you but to kill that thing out that is
[1:22:27] is to stop that thing. Ain't that right?
[1:22:30] That is is affecting you in in and
[1:22:33] making you sick or or whatever. So So
[1:22:36] but if the doctor doesn't know what he's
[1:22:37] doing and he puts too much poison in it,
[1:22:40] well then it's going to kill you. or if
[1:22:43] if if he doesn't put enough poison in it
[1:22:46] or whatever, then you can take it and
[1:22:49] keep taking it and it ain't going to do
[1:22:50] you any good. Ain't that right? It it
[1:22:53] ain't going to do you any good. So then
[1:22:55] the prophet says, "A good doctor knows
[1:22:57] just how much your body can take." Ain't
[1:23:01] that right? And he will do what it takes
[1:23:04] to get you to feeling better to where
[1:23:06] you're feeling back normal again. Ain't
[1:23:09] that right? He said, "Now that's the way
[1:23:11] the prescription of God is. No matter
[1:23:13] how much somebody else says it must be
[1:23:15] done this way or that way, don't you
[1:23:18] believe it. When you follow the word
[1:23:20] exactly to the letter, that's it." Hold
[1:23:23] on to it. See, we've got those who say,
[1:23:26] "Well, you must be sprinkled." Well,
[1:23:28] see, they got those. See, you must use
[1:23:31] the titles of Father, Son, and Holy
[1:23:33] Ghost. There's no such things in the
[1:23:35] Bible. No such place anybody was ever
[1:23:38] baptized in the Bible. Amen. Any other
[1:23:40] way besides the name of Jesus Christ. So
[1:23:43] that's a dogma that was added in the
[1:23:46] Roman Catholic Church that's carried
[1:23:48] down through traditions. Ain't that
[1:23:50] right? But in the midst of all of that,
[1:23:52] the prescription still remains. And
[1:23:56] that's why we got so many sick children
[1:23:59] because they're not listening to what
[1:24:01] the doctor said. Can you say amen? There
[1:24:05] there's so many sick church members.
[1:24:07] Amen. Not just physically, but but but
[1:24:09] in their soul, in in their Christian
[1:24:12] walk, amen, is because they're not
[1:24:14] listening, amen, to what the doctor
[1:24:17] says. Ain't that right? Well, see,
[1:24:19] here's what God does. The prophet said,
[1:24:21] God doesn't send his ministers to preach
[1:24:24] the gospel only to have it return unto
[1:24:28] him void. Amen. See, the word of God
[1:24:31] correctly balanced, amen, is the right
[1:24:35] prescription to to heal anything. It it
[1:24:39] it can heal your body. It can heal your
[1:24:42] soul. It it can touch your mental
[1:24:44] capacity. It can restore marriages. It
[1:24:47] can restore Amen. Love. It can res It
[1:24:51] can break down the the the walls of
[1:24:54] partition. It it it can destroy
[1:24:56] anything, amen, that the devil is trying
[1:24:59] to bring in your life.
[1:25:03] So why would God send a message, a
[1:25:06] prophet with the message if it was going
[1:25:07] to kill us?
[1:25:10] I think preachers need to quit worrying
[1:25:12] about the message killing you
[1:25:16] and just preach the message.
[1:25:19] It's the only prescription that you
[1:25:21] need. Amen. to bring a revival. Can you
[1:25:25] say amen? But so, so if if we're so
[1:25:28] worried about it that the people getting
[1:25:31] too much of the message and you know
[1:25:32] that comes from the devil, but they get
[1:25:35] too worried about the the people so
[1:25:37] worried about the people getting too
[1:25:39] much of the message that it's going to
[1:25:40] kill them. It's going to make them
[1:25:42] awall. It's going to make them this.
[1:25:43] It's going to make them that. No, it's
[1:25:45] the opinions of man mixed with the
[1:25:48] message. Amen. That kills the church.
[1:25:51] Amen. Amen.
[1:25:55] See, the prophet's message has the right
[1:25:57] balance. Can you say amen? The word
[1:26:01] comes to a prophet.
[1:26:03] See, this message won't make you a
[1:26:05] legalist
[1:26:07] and spiritually kill you.
[1:26:09] This message won't make you too much
[1:26:11] Calvinist to where you make grace a
[1:26:14] disgrace. That's right. Can you say
[1:26:17] amen? See, there's nothing wrong with
[1:26:20] the message.
[1:26:25] But instead of taking the word of God
[1:26:27] for the day, people take man's ideas and
[1:26:29] it kills them.
[1:26:33] Brother Brandham said that's the way of
[1:26:35] death. It's that that's the way. See,
[1:26:37] you're taking the way of death. Now,
[1:26:40] brother Brandham in indictment says they
[1:26:42] are guilty of crucifixion or trying to
[1:26:45] crucify the spirit. They call for a
[1:26:47] revival everywhere. Well, how are you
[1:26:49] going to have a revival? Now, notice the
[1:26:51] question. I think it's a powerful thing.
[1:26:54] How are you going to have a revival when
[1:26:56] the word itself can't work through the
[1:26:58] people?
[1:27:01] Ain't that right? Now, they're crying
[1:27:03] for revival everywhere. People are
[1:27:05] crying for revival. Churches are crying
[1:27:07] for revival. But brother Brandham just
[1:27:09] asked the simple question and and
[1:27:11] actually gives them the answer. How are
[1:27:13] you going to have revival when the word
[1:27:15] can't work
[1:27:17] through the people?
[1:27:19] Can you say amen? See, they they they
[1:27:21] want revival in the churches, but they
[1:27:24] deny the thing that brings the revival.
[1:27:27] They deny the revival itself. Brother
[1:27:30] Brandham said, see, they have their own
[1:27:31] forms of godliness and deny the word of
[1:27:34] life. The thing that can bring a
[1:27:37] revival,
[1:27:38] it'll bring revival in the home. It'll
[1:27:41] bring revival in a person's soul. It'll
[1:27:43] bring revival in a church. It'll bring
[1:27:46] revival. Can you say amen? See, now you
[1:27:49] cannot crucify the prophet said you
[1:27:51] cannot crucify God himself for he is
[1:27:53] eternal. You you can't crucify the word
[1:27:56] for the word is eternal. Ain't that
[1:27:58] right? So then what what they're doing
[1:28:01] then is they're crucifying the effects
[1:28:04] of the word.
[1:28:06] They're crucifying the effects. See, he
[1:28:08] says they're crucifying the effects of
[1:28:11] the gospel upon the people by their
[1:28:13] creeds. And that's the crucifixion
[1:28:17] that where the public set in these big
[1:28:19] morgs and called churches and
[1:28:20] denominations and draw a line of creed.
[1:28:24] See, well, the word of God can't have an
[1:28:26] effect upon them because they condemn
[1:28:28] the very things that Christ said would
[1:28:30] take place.
[1:28:33] It just doesn't come according to the
[1:28:35] creed. Ain't that right? So how do they
[1:28:37] crucify the word? Well, brother Brown
[1:28:40] says, well, when Jesus said he's the
[1:28:42] same yesterday, today, and forever, they
[1:28:44] say, well,
[1:28:46] in in a way, he is.
[1:28:48] You crucified the effects of the word to
[1:28:51] the people. The last commandment that
[1:28:54] Jesus gave to the church there in Mark
[1:28:57] was go out and and preach the gospel.
[1:29:00] That was the commission. Preach the
[1:29:01] gospel. Ain't that right? Amen. And
[1:29:04] these signs shall follow them that
[1:29:06] believe and and and and and these things
[1:29:09] and they say, "Well, that was for a
[1:29:12] gener that that generation and they make
[1:29:14] the commandment of God of none effect to
[1:29:17] this." See, they crucify the effect of
[1:29:20] the word to the people. Hello, church.
[1:29:24] See, so uh all of these denominations,
[1:29:27] the prophet said, have set a the word
[1:29:29] aside, deny the work of the spirit of
[1:29:33] God, uh subjugate the the leoty and make
[1:29:37] it impossible for the leoty to worship
[1:29:40] God unless they come through them or
[1:29:43] their pattern, which is nothing but a
[1:29:46] blueprint of unbelief from Satan
[1:29:50] himself.
[1:29:52] Can you say amen? Now, by the message of
[1:29:54] the hour, by the time that we're looking
[1:29:56] in, we're seeing things are all around.
[1:30:00] We know that the man of sin is fixing to
[1:30:03] be revealed.
[1:30:06] Paul called him the son of predition.
[1:30:08] The man of sin, the son of predition.
[1:30:11] Well, we know what sin is. It's
[1:30:13] unbelief.
[1:30:14] Ain't that right?
[1:30:16] Brother Brandon said, "What is it?"
[1:30:18] Unbelief in the Holy Ghost. Unbelief in
[1:30:20] the word of God. unbelief in the power
[1:30:23] of God. It's just unbelief. Anything
[1:30:26] that God does, unbelief. Now, they'll
[1:30:29] accept it back then, but but unbelief
[1:30:32] for today. And so, this this man of sin
[1:30:36] is the son of predition. Predition is
[1:30:39] means hell. So, he's he's the son of
[1:30:42] hell. Amen. See, his origin came from
[1:30:45] hell. He going to go back to hell. Ain't
[1:30:48] that right? But we see that unbelief has
[1:30:50] been working down through the ages uh uh
[1:30:54] uh uh through the ages. But it's
[1:30:56] becoming more positive all the time,
[1:30:59] more pronounced, more of a reality, more
[1:31:02] more so in this age than ever before is
[1:31:06] unbelief that is striking the people.
[1:31:10] Ain't that right? Unbelief is becoming
[1:31:12] more prominent in the people. Amen. to
[1:31:15] where you can't hardly find anyone
[1:31:17] that'll just take God at his word,
[1:31:20] receive that word without questioning
[1:31:22] and just believe it.
[1:31:26] In 1961, Brother Brown said, "The lids
[1:31:29] come off of hell." So, that's right. And
[1:31:32] streams of demon powers pouring from
[1:31:34] everywhere. It's conquered the nations.
[1:31:37] It's conquered politics till it's rotten
[1:31:39] to the core. It's conquered the churches
[1:31:41] until they know nothing but
[1:31:42] denomination. Can you say amen? And I
[1:31:46] say this, why is people in the message
[1:31:47] getting confused about the message? Is
[1:31:50] because unbelief, Amen. Unbelief is is
[1:31:54] prevailing in in people to where they
[1:31:57] they just can't accept the message. They
[1:32:00] they have seen this go off. They've seen
[1:32:02] this guy go off. They have seen this
[1:32:04] false doctrine and that false doctrine.
[1:32:06] And they get their eyes upon all of that
[1:32:08] instead of just looking at the message
[1:32:10] and say, "I just accept the message."
[1:32:13] Can can you say amen? I may not
[1:32:15] understand everything, but I just accept
[1:32:17] the message.
[1:32:19] Well, then they say, "Well, you know, we
[1:32:21] I've been called deity, you know, uh you
[1:32:24] just a deity guy, you know." No, I'm not
[1:32:26] a deity guy, but I just believe you
[1:32:28] accept the message and the message is
[1:32:30] the absolute. Now, now I understand
[1:32:32] Brother Brandon mistook, you know, the
[1:32:34] 700 for 7,000 for 700. And and he, you
[1:32:38] know, he he made he called Elijah one
[1:32:41] time. He uh he was talking about Elisha
[1:32:43] and called him Elijah and all that. I
[1:32:46] understand you know that that we you
[1:32:49] know them things uh them things are
[1:32:52] there but the message itself
[1:32:56] there's a message behind it. Can you say
[1:32:59] amen? It's it's not for us to get into
[1:33:02] the all this debates of well you know he
[1:33:05] said it here and then he says something
[1:33:07] different over here. He can't even get
[1:33:09] his facts right. Amen. But the message
[1:33:11] is right.
[1:33:13] That's right.
[1:33:16] That's right.
[1:33:20] So we we see that the lid of hell and
[1:33:24] and is is come off. Demons are pouring
[1:33:26] in and it's been building up, building
[1:33:30] up, building up till it's that spirit of
[1:33:32] unbelief is becoming more prominent in
[1:33:35] people today.
[1:33:37] It and it's like the shadow. Amen. You
[1:33:40] know, it it a as as it's far away from
[1:33:44] from the wall, you know, you may just
[1:33:47] see a little bit of a of a difference of
[1:33:50] a shade, but as that hand gets closer
[1:33:53] and closer and closer and closer to the
[1:33:55] wall, to the thing that it's reflecting,
[1:33:58] Amen. See, then then you find, amen,
[1:34:01] that now you're starting to see not just
[1:34:03] a black thing, not just a little shade.
[1:34:05] You're actually seeing a hand form in
[1:34:08] that shadow because the hand and the
[1:34:11] shadow are becoming together.
[1:34:14] It's it's it's getting closer to the
[1:34:16] real thing. Ain't that right? Brother
[1:34:18] Brandon said, "If I had my hand up a man
[1:34:21] uh uh uh from there, the shadow way, it
[1:34:25] looks dismal. as it gets closer, it
[1:34:27] becomes more positive until it becomes a
[1:34:30] real hand. Ain't that right? It's just
[1:34:32] like uh the revealing of the son of man
[1:34:35] today. Amen. Brother Brandon says for
[1:34:37] years after years after years as the
[1:34:39] church has come down, the power of God
[1:34:42] just growing closer and closer till now,
[1:34:45] it's just about to take on the image of
[1:34:47] Jesus Christ. Ain't that right? We've
[1:34:50] had the power through the church ages.
[1:34:52] Amen. And it's just been a reflection.
[1:34:55] Amen. of something that is coming. But
[1:34:58] we're here now to the very image of
[1:35:01] Jesus Christ in the church.
[1:35:04] Well, that spirit of unbelief has taken
[1:35:06] on an image.
[1:35:08] Can you say amen? Amen. See, brother
[1:35:11] Brandon said, "See, God is here. He has
[1:35:13] proved himself present. You'll never be
[1:35:15] any closer to him until you see him uh
[1:35:19] uh face to face." Now, think of that.
[1:35:22] You'll never be any more closer to God.
[1:35:27] Why? Because he has so impersonated
[1:35:30] himself in his church.
[1:35:33] Praise the Lord.
[1:35:36] Praise the Lord.
[1:35:38] Abraham said, "The son of God
[1:35:39] impersonated himself in his church as
[1:35:42] son of man." Ain't that right? Now, the
[1:35:45] son of man is to be or the not the son
[1:35:47] of man but the man of sin,
[1:35:50] son of predition.
[1:35:52] is to be revealed. That man of sin,
[1:35:56] ain't that right? It's an incarnation
[1:36:00] of Satan himself
[1:36:02] coming as a man coming in in flesh. Can
[1:36:05] you say amen? That spirit that's been
[1:36:07] working in them in the unbelievers
[1:36:11] has come to a place
[1:36:14] that he's incarnated in a man. Ain't
[1:36:17] that right? But notice, notice the word
[1:36:20] for our hour.
[1:36:23] Come out of her,
[1:36:26] my people.
[1:36:28] That's the word for the age. Amen. Come
[1:36:30] out of her, my people, that you be not
[1:36:33] partakers of her sins and receive that
[1:36:35] you receive not of her plagues. Other
[1:36:38] words, don't be identified with her. Can
[1:36:40] you say amen? It's fine to to believe
[1:36:43] what Moses said and Noah said, but but
[1:36:46] better receive the word for this age.
[1:36:49] Ain't that right? And that is come out
[1:36:51] of her. Forsake her doctrines. Forsake
[1:36:54] her tradition. Forsake it all. Come to
[1:36:58] full belief in the word of God. Amen.
[1:37:01] Second uh Corinthians 6:17,
[1:37:04] "Wherefore come out from among them, and
[1:37:06] be ye separate, sayith the Lord, and
[1:37:08] touch not the unclean thing, and I will
[1:37:11] receive you, and will be a father unto
[1:37:13] you." Ain't that right? And you shall be
[1:37:15] my sons and daughters, sayeth the Lord
[1:37:18] Almighty. Who's he going to be a father
[1:37:20] to? Those that come out. Who's going to
[1:37:23] be the sons and daughters to him? is
[1:37:26] those that have come out, those that
[1:37:28] have taken this message and received
[1:37:31] that word in their heart. Don't waste
[1:37:34] your time building an ark. That's right.
[1:37:37] That ain't going to help you in this
[1:37:38] age. Amen.
[1:37:43] That's right. You don't have to leave
[1:37:44] one one town to go to another, one state
[1:37:47] to go to another. That ain't going to
[1:37:50] help you.
[1:37:52] Right.
[1:37:53] So, brother Bram said Jesus Christ was
[1:37:56] the person man God. Hallelujah. He was
[1:37:59] the manifestation of God. He was God in
[1:38:02] a body form to reflect the word of God
[1:38:05] for that age to make that age see God's
[1:38:08] promise for that age.
[1:38:11] And the Holy Ghost is the same thing
[1:38:14] today. It's the spirit of God upon the
[1:38:17] written word trying to find somebody to
[1:38:20] reflect itself to this age to prove that
[1:38:23] he's the same yesterday, today, and
[1:38:26] forever. The works that I do shall you
[1:38:28] do also. Jesus Christ the same yesterday
[1:38:30] to ever. See, constantly, constantly
[1:38:33] trying to find its way to reflect
[1:38:36] itself.
[1:38:37] Can you say amen?
[1:38:39] Now, we know he's the word. So the word
[1:38:42] is constantly trying to find a way, find
[1:38:46] somebody that he can reflect itself
[1:38:48] through. That word can be reflected
[1:38:51] through the promise of the age.
[1:38:55] I hope this is all right to you.
[1:38:58] You see, the word of God is meant to be
[1:39:00] effective.
[1:39:03] I want you to understand that now
[1:39:04] church, you young people, the word of
[1:39:07] God is to be effective.
[1:39:09] It's one thing just to come to church
[1:39:11] and just um hear brother Sean preach
[1:39:14] again and go through the motions of the
[1:39:18] singing and whatever we do.
[1:39:23] But see, there's a reason why we're
[1:39:24] preaching the gospel. There's a reason
[1:39:26] why Brother Terry preaches. There's a
[1:39:28] reason why Brother Amos and and and
[1:39:30] these brothers preach. And there's a
[1:39:32] reason that God does these things. The
[1:39:34] word is to be effective.
[1:39:37] There's a reason that God sent a prophet
[1:39:39] to us. The word is to be effective.
[1:39:43] It's one thing to desire God. There's
[1:39:46] one thing to desire to be more like him
[1:39:48] and to reflect him. But without the
[1:39:50] word, you can't. The only way you can
[1:39:53] become more like him is by the word of
[1:39:56] God.
[1:39:58] Can you say amen? The only way you can
[1:40:00] live in a revival is by the word of God.
[1:40:03] Amen. The only way you can come out of
[1:40:05] her is by the word of God.
[1:40:08] Amen. Ain't that right? How could
[1:40:12] Lazarus? It it it didn't matter how dead
[1:40:14] Lazarus was. It didn't matter how long
[1:40:17] he had been in that grave. That didn't
[1:40:20] matter. But he wouldn't have come out
[1:40:22] even if it was the first day, second
[1:40:24] day, a thousand days without the word of
[1:40:26] God. It took the word. Amen. And no
[1:40:32] matter how much of the how awful the
[1:40:35] condition, how impossible the situation,
[1:40:37] the word commanded it. The word changed
[1:40:41] it. Amen. We can moan. We can groan. We
[1:40:44] can belly ache about our problem. But
[1:40:46] the word of God is what's going to
[1:40:48] change the problem. Change that
[1:40:51] situation. The word is to be effective.
[1:40:56] That's right.
[1:40:59] Ain't that right? In the beginning, God
[1:41:03] spoke his word and the spirit of God
[1:41:05] followed the word
[1:41:08] and made the word come to pass. Praise
[1:41:09] the Lord. It wouldn't have happened if
[1:41:11] God didn't speak the word. But God spoke
[1:41:14] it. He sent his word and the spirit come
[1:41:18] by. Now notice, I read this quote last
[1:41:21] Wednesday that Brother Brandham said,
[1:41:23] "Immediately after that prophet's
[1:41:25] message, God goes to work."
[1:41:27] This is where we're at.
[1:41:30] The carnal person wants another prophet.
[1:41:32] We need another messenger. We need
[1:41:34] another person.
[1:41:36] No.
[1:41:38] After God sends the prophet with the
[1:41:40] word,
[1:41:41] then the spirit of God, God work. That's
[1:41:45] right.
[1:41:47] Hello. That's right.
[1:41:50] After the prophet gives the word, then
[1:41:52] God goes to work on the word.
[1:41:56] Aren't you glad you got the word
[1:41:57] concerning you?
[1:41:59] Now, remember, God moves behind the
[1:42:02] prophet if the prophet's got the word of
[1:42:04] God. For my word shall not return unto
[1:42:05] me void, but it'll accomplish that from
[1:42:08] which I it was sent for and the purpose
[1:42:10] it was sent for, it'll have to come.
[1:42:13] There will be a group that'll be just
[1:42:15] like throwing water on a duck's back.
[1:42:18] Preach the word and they just
[1:42:22] doesn't mean that the word ain't
[1:42:23] powerful. Doesn't mean that the word
[1:42:25] can't work. It's just they're not in a
[1:42:28] condition to receive the word. That's
[1:42:29] right. Y'all with me? And and I can say
[1:42:33] this, you know, and and and church,
[1:42:36] Satan has thrown all kinds of
[1:42:38] entertainment for us. Got us so busy
[1:42:40] that when we come to the church, we're
[1:42:41] so tired.
[1:42:43] We got our minds so preoccupied on
[1:42:46] everything else
[1:42:50] that if we're not careful, we aren't in
[1:42:53] tune to receive the word.
[1:42:58] So he says there will be somebody there.
[1:43:00] He said, but there will be somebody
[1:43:02] there to get it because God is sending
[1:43:04] it.
[1:43:06] The word will not return void. It will
[1:43:08] accomplish what it's been purposed for.
[1:43:11] So, I'd say it this way. The word of God
[1:43:14] came. Now, the rapture is at hand. Why?
[1:43:18] The rapture follows the word. Couldn't
[1:43:20] have a rapture without the word. The
[1:43:23] word had to come in its pure form to
[1:43:26] bring on a rapture.
[1:43:28] The changing of the body of the body is
[1:43:32] only the effect of the word that came.
[1:43:37] Revival is the effect of the word. Why?
[1:43:40] It's a word revival.
[1:43:42] It's the word that brought revival. The
[1:43:45] word had to come and then all of a
[1:43:47] sudden the spirit followed that word and
[1:43:50] God began to work on that word and all
[1:43:53] of a sudden revival comes alive in our
[1:43:55] hearts. Can you say amen? That's exactly
[1:43:58] right. See, well, why did the lamb open
[1:44:01] the book in this age?
[1:44:04] Why did he give it to the seventh angel,
[1:44:06] a prophet of Malachi 4? Why did he send
[1:44:09] to us the prophet of Malachi 4? See why?
[1:44:13] He's looking for a certain effect.
[1:44:18] Amen.
[1:44:20] If he brought Moses message, there would
[1:44:22] be no effect.
[1:44:25] If we're living in a Pentecostal
[1:44:27] message, it would be no effect.
[1:44:30] But God says it's time for a rapture.
[1:44:32] It's time for a body change. It's time
[1:44:35] for adoption.
[1:44:38] Brother Ram said there out there was no
[1:44:40] other age. There's no other time outside
[1:44:42] of this time for the manifestation of
[1:44:44] sons of God. So then God brought a
[1:44:47] prophet with a word for this age and
[1:44:50] that word is affecting us and bringing
[1:44:53] us into manifestation of sons.
[1:45:01] Why did why did he send his word today
[1:45:05] in this age? What's the purpose of it?
[1:45:10] For redemption claims.
[1:45:14] That's right.
[1:45:16] Can you say amen?
[1:45:18] He's already paid the price of
[1:45:20] redemption already. It's fine to point
[1:45:23] the people back to what he was
[1:45:24] yesterday,
[1:45:28] but what good is it going to do,
[1:45:31] when they reject the word for today?
[1:45:36] That's true. See, you're finding out
[1:45:43] that everybody believe in Christ of
[1:45:44] yesterday, what he did back then ain't
[1:45:46] going in a rapture. That's right. That's
[1:45:49] right. So, believing in what Moses done
[1:45:51] ain't going to put them in a rapture.
[1:45:53] Believing what happened in Noah's day
[1:45:55] ain't going to put him in a rapture.
[1:45:57] Believing what Jesus did ain't going to
[1:45:59] believe it put him in a rapture. I hope
[1:46:02] you understand. Can you say amen? If
[1:46:04] that was the only thing putting us in
[1:46:06] the rapture, I'd stay as as a
[1:46:07] Pentecostal.
[1:46:09] If if that was the only thing going to
[1:46:10] put us in the rapture, Amen. You could
[1:46:12] stay a Baptist. You could stay whatever.
[1:46:14] You need the message to put you in that
[1:46:17] rapture.
[1:46:20] Amen. That's right.
[1:46:24] So, so the word, see it, he sent his
[1:46:28] word because it's time for redemption
[1:46:30] claims. Amen. We were healed 2,000 years
[1:46:35] ago. How many believes that?
[1:46:37] We were saved. We were delivered. We
[1:46:39] were justified as he rose. We we were
[1:46:44] loose, forgiven. All of them things.
[1:46:47] When Jesus said it was it it is finished
[1:46:49] there hanging on the cross, it finished
[1:46:52] it.
[1:46:54] Ain't that right?
[1:46:56] So then back then, see, God sent his
[1:47:00] word to do that. That word became a man.
[1:47:06] Ain't that right?
[1:47:08] Word took on flesh.
[1:47:12] And that word died for us.
[1:47:15] Ain't that right? It was the word that
[1:47:18] created a blood cell in the womb of
[1:47:20] Mary.
[1:47:22] And the prophet said, "God wrapped
[1:47:24] himself in that blood cell and became
[1:47:27] flesh." And in the beginning was the
[1:47:30] word. The word was with God. The word
[1:47:32] was God. And the word became flesh. God
[1:47:35] manifested in flesh. Can you say amen?
[1:47:40] The word that came to the prophets by
[1:47:42] inspiration became flesh to fulfill what
[1:47:46] the prophet spoke of. The word that
[1:47:49] spoke of a redeemer took on flesh and
[1:47:51] became redeemer. The word that spoke of
[1:47:54] Messiah became flesh and became promised
[1:47:57] Messiah. The word that spoke of the
[1:47:59] prophet likened unto Moses that was to
[1:48:02] come became flesh and became the great
[1:48:06] prophet that was spoken. The word that
[1:48:09] spoke of the lamb became flesh and
[1:48:12] became the lamb.
[1:48:14] Can you say amen? And Christ, the living
[1:48:17] word, made way for our redemption
[1:48:22] 2,000 years ago. Ain't that right? It
[1:48:25] was the word that was crucified.
[1:48:28] It was the word that took our place. How
[1:48:30] many believes that it was the word, the
[1:48:32] prophet said, "The word bled for you.
[1:48:35] The word bled for me." Can you say,
[1:48:36] "Amen." That word, Amen. All of that.
[1:48:40] See, he says, "The word become blood."
[1:48:42] The word bled for you and you are washed
[1:48:45] in bleeding word. The word bleeding the
[1:48:49] life of God in the word and the word was
[1:48:51] blood for you that you might be washed
[1:48:53] from these filth the filth of these
[1:48:55] prostitutes and be cleaned and
[1:48:57] sanctified by the washing of water of
[1:49:00] the word and make your mind and heart
[1:49:02] stayed on God and on his word. Can you
[1:49:04] say amen? That's right. See, so the
[1:49:07] prophet says he redeemed us from our
[1:49:10] sins by the washing of his blood by his
[1:49:14] word. How many's thankful for that? I'm
[1:49:18] thankful for that. And we've accepted
[1:49:21] what he's done. How many's accepted what
[1:49:22] he's done 2,000 years ago? We've
[1:49:25] accepted it. We're not preaching Messiah
[1:49:28] coming, Messiah going to redeem. We've
[1:49:30] accepted it. We believe that.
[1:49:36] But he sent a word
[1:49:38] in this age to claim what he has
[1:49:40] redeemed. Can you say amen? Oh my. And
[1:49:45] he's able to claim you because he
[1:49:48] redeemed you. He's able to claim you
[1:49:51] because he loosed you. He's able to
[1:49:53] claim you because there's a blood there
[1:49:56] that is speaking for you.
[1:49:59] There's nothing against you. How many
[1:50:02] believes that there's nothing against
[1:50:04] you? That's the word for the age.
[1:50:06] There's nothing against you. You are the
[1:50:09] pure, spotless, virtuous bride of Jesus
[1:50:12] Christ.
[1:50:15] He redeemed the book.
[1:50:18] Ain't that right?
[1:50:20] Now he come and that lamb took that book
[1:50:25] and loosed the seals. Brother Brandham
[1:50:28] said, "What is this book of redemption?
[1:50:29] This title deed, abstract title deed.
[1:50:32] You say abstract. What does an abstract
[1:50:34] mean? It means searched. It searched all
[1:50:37] the way back to its beginning. Amen.
[1:50:39] Like that drop of little drop of ink
[1:50:42] this morning. When it struck that
[1:50:43] bleach, it went all the way back. And
[1:50:45] when sin has been confessed and fallen
[1:50:47] into the blood of Christ, it gives it it
[1:50:50] gives an abstract right straight back to
[1:50:52] the creator again. And you become a son
[1:50:54] of God. How many believes that? Say you
[1:50:57] become a son of God. abstract title deed
[1:50:59] is held in the hand of the Almighty. Its
[1:51:02] redemption, its redemption means all
[1:51:04] legal possession to all that was lost by
[1:51:07] Adam and Eve. Oh my, what it ought to do
[1:51:10] to that born again Christian. It's legal
[1:51:12] possession to the abstract deed, the
[1:51:14] title deed of eternal life means that
[1:51:16] you possess everything that Adam and Eve
[1:51:20] lost. Can you say amen? You possess it.
[1:51:24] That's the redemption claims. It's time
[1:51:26] to go back. Amen. That's right, sons of
[1:51:30] God.
[1:51:32] I won't keep you too much longer now,
[1:51:35] but according to Jesus, we spoke on it
[1:51:37] uh Wednesday night, but according to
[1:51:40] what Jesus said, there are four types of
[1:51:44] grounds that the seed falls upon. Stony
[1:51:47] ground, the wayside,
[1:51:49] thorns and thistles, and the good
[1:51:51] ground. Right?
[1:51:54] These four grounds represent the peoples
[1:51:56] of the world. The seed that is sown is
[1:51:59] the word of God. Brother Brandham called
[1:52:01] it the seed of life.
[1:52:04] But what Jesus tells us is the first
[1:52:07] three grounds doesn't produce nothing.
[1:52:09] Even though the seed fell upon them,
[1:52:12] it it produces nothing. There are those
[1:52:16] that are by the wayside. They hear the
[1:52:18] word. Then the devil comes and takes the
[1:52:20] word out of their hearts lest they
[1:52:22] should believe and be saved. So even
[1:52:24] though the word came to them,
[1:52:27] it doesn't produce anything because
[1:52:30] Satan was able to take their take that
[1:52:33] word and snatch it out of them
[1:52:36] probably through creeds and dogmas and I
[1:52:39] don't know anyway takes that word out of
[1:52:43] their hearts lest they should be believe
[1:52:45] and be saved. Those on the rock receive
[1:52:49] the word with joy
[1:52:54] when they hear it, but yet they have no
[1:52:57] root. Yeah. So you see people get
[1:52:59] excited about the word, but the word
[1:53:02] doesn't affect them
[1:53:05] because they have no root.
[1:53:09] Those among the thorns hear the word and
[1:53:11] go forth, but are choked with cares and
[1:53:13] riches and pleasures of this life. Yeah.
[1:53:16] And notice, and bring no fruit to
[1:53:19] perfection.
[1:53:22] But those on good ground have heard the
[1:53:25] word, Jesus said,
[1:53:28] in an honest and good heart and keep it.
[1:53:32] Amen.
[1:53:34] Note it, keep it. They they keep that
[1:53:37] word.
[1:53:39] And bring forth fruit a hundfold with
[1:53:43] patience.
[1:53:45] Amen.
[1:53:48] So the others receive it, but it's
[1:53:51] somehow taken from them. They they they
[1:53:54] just they have no root. They they they
[1:53:57] just the the pleasures and the things of
[1:54:00] life
[1:54:02] uh means more to them than the word of
[1:54:04] God. And but to that good ground, they
[1:54:08] receive it and they keep it. Now church,
[1:54:11] to keep the word, you got to guard it,
[1:54:13] right? Because Satan going to t try you
[1:54:16] to see what kind of ground you are,
[1:54:18] right? But that that good ground,
[1:54:22] they're they're going to keep it. Rains
[1:54:24] and storms and all these birds come
[1:54:26] trying to grab it and all these things,
[1:54:29] spirits of unbelief and all these
[1:54:31] things, but they guard it, man. Amen.
[1:54:36] And with patience,
[1:54:38] they bring forth a hundfold.
[1:54:41] Now, Brother Brham said, "If the good
[1:54:43] word falls on poor ground, it'll bring a
[1:54:46] poor crop.
[1:54:48] You take good grains and put it in good
[1:54:50] ground on the right condition, it'll
[1:54:52] bring forth a hundfold." So is the word
[1:54:54] of God. When it's brought into the human
[1:54:57] heart with a faith, undying faith in the
[1:55:01] Lord Jesus Christ with the Holy Spirit
[1:55:03] and the power of God there to water it,
[1:55:05] it'll germatize and bring forth
[1:55:07] everything it said it would. Can you say
[1:55:11] amen? Now, Brother Brham teaches us that
[1:55:14] the good ground is what? Prepared
[1:55:18] ground.
[1:55:20] God prepared you before the foundation
[1:55:23] of the world. So, so this this ground is
[1:55:26] this good ground is is those who were
[1:55:29] predestinated,
[1:55:31] right? And and they are the ones to let
[1:55:35] the word have preeminence. They are the
[1:55:38] ones that see the value of the word for
[1:55:40] their age. They receive it now.
[1:55:43] They receive it and they protect it.
[1:55:47] They guard against all the fouls of uh
[1:55:51] evil spirits that are trying to take
[1:55:53] that seed out of him. Ain't that right?
[1:55:57] See, they let the word come to its
[1:56:00] fullness.
[1:56:02] Hello, its full potential. So they
[1:56:05] receive the word and it brings a
[1:56:07] hundfold
[1:56:09] in them.
[1:56:13] Now you are an attribute of God, a
[1:56:15] genancy seed to God, right? Yes sir.
[1:56:17] That's how God you were prepared. See in
[1:56:20] God's mind were eternal thoughts which
[1:56:23] makes you an eternal attribute of God if
[1:56:25] you were in his thinking. See and then
[1:56:28] that eternal thought was expressed in
[1:56:30] the word. See, so this word has to do
[1:56:33] with you. You believe that? This word
[1:56:36] has to do with you just as it had to do
[1:56:38] with Jesus. That's right. See, Jesus was
[1:56:41] predestinated to be what he was. He
[1:56:44] didn't just be born on this earth and
[1:56:46] just say, "Guys, I think I'm the lamb of
[1:56:48] God. I think I'm going to be." No. God
[1:56:50] said he was the lamb of God. When God
[1:56:54] had the lamb slain, amen, before the
[1:56:56] foundation of the world, Jesus Christ's
[1:56:59] name was attached to that.
[1:57:03] You believe it? See, so not just anybody
[1:57:06] could be the lamb. Not just anybody
[1:57:08] could be the redeemer. Amen. See, so
[1:57:11] now, now notice the Bible says that the
[1:57:13] sons of God shouted for joy before the
[1:57:17] foundation of the world.
[1:57:20] Brother Bram lets us in on it. Why? They
[1:57:22] shouted for joy. Several a couple places
[1:57:26] here they shouted when they saw the plan
[1:57:28] of salvation. God putting their name on
[1:57:31] the lamb's book of life. Another place
[1:57:34] they shouted for joy when they seen that
[1:57:37] someday they would tabernacle here on
[1:57:39] earth and the king Melzdc would come in
[1:57:43] the righteousness of God, give his life
[1:57:45] to redeem us uh to God back again and
[1:57:48] outshine the stars forever and ever. Can
[1:57:51] you say amen? Now church, not everybody
[1:57:54] can shout for that reason. They shout
[1:57:57] because of the baseball. They shout
[1:57:58] because of their their sports team that
[1:58:00] is winning. They shout and they holler
[1:58:02] at a party. They shout over music. They
[1:58:05] shout because they won the lottery. But
[1:58:08] the sons of God are shouting because
[1:58:11] they saw the lamb come and redeem them,
[1:58:14] secure their place, and they know where
[1:58:17] they're going. Amen.
[1:58:20] Can you say amen?
[1:58:22] Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Now, people don't
[1:58:25] want us to stop shouting or they they
[1:58:27] they don't they don't like us shouting
[1:58:31] and rejoicing and they of course always
[1:58:35] name us Pentecostals and we bore that
[1:58:37] name ever since we come into the
[1:58:39] message. But listen church, God saw us
[1:58:42] doing it,
[1:58:46] right?
[1:58:47] They they want a church that is so quiet
[1:58:49] and intellectual and just, you know,
[1:58:53] just everybody calm, cool, and
[1:58:54] collective.
[1:58:56] But God saw us shouting
[1:59:01] right.
[1:59:06] God saw us excited about the word
[1:59:11] now. I don't know about you, but I
[1:59:12] receive it. I receive that word.
[1:59:17] Can you say amen?
[1:59:19] See, he says God in his great thinking
[1:59:22] seen us shouting and rejoicing in our
[1:59:24] salvation through Jesus. See, so he says
[1:59:27] the prophet says we were identified in
[1:59:31] the immortal realms with God 10 million
[1:59:34] years before the world was ever formed.
[1:59:37] I was back there with him.
[1:59:40] And I say this, my name was attached to
[1:59:44] every promise that God gave concerning
[1:59:47] this bride for this age.
[1:59:50] You believe it?
[1:59:52] My name is attached to the rapture.
[1:59:57] Nobody can take my place because God saw
[2:00:01] it. God predestinated it. God ordained
[2:00:04] it. And he sent the word
[2:00:07] that I may go into it.
[2:00:10] My name is attached to the changing of
[2:00:12] the body. My name is attached to
[2:00:15] adoption of sons. My name is attached.
[2:00:19] How about yours? My name is attached to
[2:00:23] ruling and reigning with Christ. My name
[2:00:26] is attached sitting on the throne with
[2:00:28] him. When God gave the promise, he had
[2:00:32] my name attached to it.
[2:00:35] and then he sent a word in this day for
[2:00:38] me to be affected by it.
[2:00:42] Can you say amen?
[2:00:44] Those who were believed in stood in
[2:00:46] Moses Noah's day and believed it were
[2:00:49] affected by it and they sailed through
[2:00:52] the flood
[2:00:53] in that old ark. Right? Those who
[2:00:56] believe the the message of Moses's day,
[2:00:59] they went all the way through into the
[2:01:01] promised land.
[2:01:03] Why? They were affected by it. The word
[2:01:06] in their day took them there and
[2:01:09] positionally placed them in there. And
[2:01:12] so is the word in this age. Oh, do you
[2:01:15] love him? If the musicians will come
[2:01:20] true, the word which effectively
[2:01:24] effectively work in you, it's working in
[2:01:27] us.
[2:01:29] Hallelujah.
[2:01:32] That's why I'm here today. That's why
[2:01:34] you are here today.
[2:01:36] No other age could do it. We're that
[2:01:39] age.
[2:01:41] God didn't send the word for our age to
[2:01:44] any other age but this age.
[2:01:48] Can you say amen?
[2:01:50] Why? Because he knew when that word
[2:01:53] come, it would bring forth an effect.
[2:01:57] Rapturing grace.
[2:02:00] take a church and catch them away just
[2:02:02] before the great tribulation sets in.
[2:02:05] Can you say amen? I receive it. I
[2:02:09] receive that word. And Satan does his
[2:02:13] best to stop us. He does his best to
[2:02:15] take that word from us. He'll never be
[2:02:17] able to do it because I'm prepared. I'm
[2:02:21] pre-prepared. I'm good ground. I'll hold
[2:02:24] to it. No matter what I feel, no matter
[2:02:26] what I think, no matter what any what
[2:02:28] everybody else says,
[2:02:31] I'll hold to that word.
[2:02:34] It'll bring forth. You love him.
[2:02:37] See why
[2:02:41] I'm happy.
[2:02:43] [Music]
[2:02:45] Oh, I've accepted
[2:02:49] the word
[2:02:52] of the Lord.
[2:02:54] [Music]
[2:02:57] The revealed
[2:03:00] [Applause]
[2:03:01] word.
[2:03:03] [Music]
[2:03:05] Bless his holy name
[2:03:08] by the prophet
[2:03:11] of Malachia.
[2:03:15] Oh, sing it again.
[2:03:18] Oh, can't you see
[2:03:23] why
[2:03:25] I'm happy?
[2:03:27] [Music]
[2:03:29] Oh, I've accepted.
[2:03:33] Aren't you glad you've accepted it?
[2:03:36] Oh, yes. Good ground here this morning.
[2:03:45] Hallelujah. When unbelief is so
[2:03:48] prevalent in the age,
[2:03:51] there's good ground,
[2:03:53] receiving seed, guarding it, keeping it,
[2:03:58] and with patience bringing forth. Oh,
[2:04:02] can't you see
[2:04:06] why
[2:04:08] I'm so happy?
[2:04:11] [Music]
[2:04:12] Oh, I've accepted
[2:04:16] the word
[2:04:19] of the Lord,
[2:04:24] the revealed
[2:04:27] word
[2:04:29] that was spoken
[2:04:35] by the prophet
[2:04:38] of Mal.
[2:04:41] There's that little song. If Jesus said
[2:04:43] it, I believe it.
[2:04:46] [Music]
[2:04:48] If Jesus said it, I believe it. His word
[2:04:53] cannot lie. It is written in the Bible.
[2:04:58] I believe it till I die. Let the
[2:05:02] mountains be removed
[2:05:05] and cast into the sea.
[2:05:08] God's word will live forever
[2:05:12] throughout eternity. Oh, Jesus said it.
[2:05:16] I believe it. His word cannot lie. It is
[2:05:21] written in the Bible. I believe it till
[2:05:26] I die. Though the mountains be removed
[2:05:31] and cast into the sea, God's word will
[2:05:35] live forever
[2:05:37] throughout. Oh, sing it again. Yet Jesus
[2:05:40] said it. I believe it cuz his word
[2:05:44] cannot lie. It is written in this Bible.
[2:05:49] I'm going to believe it till I die. Let
[2:05:53] the mountains be removed and cast into
[2:05:57] the sea. God's word will live forever
[2:06:02] throughout. Sing it again. Oh, Jesus
[2:06:06] said it. Do you believe it?
[2:06:11] See, it is written in the Bible.
[2:06:15] I believe it.
[2:06:17] Though the mountains be removed and cast
[2:06:22] into the sea, God's word will live
[2:06:26] forever throughout eternity.
[2:06:32] Give me the word.
[2:06:37] Make it plain and clear to me.
[2:06:41] Give me the word.
[2:06:46] It's a light that I might see. Give me
[2:06:50] the word.
[2:06:53] [Music]
[2:06:54] It's my total victory
[2:06:58] over every situation.
[2:07:02] Give me the word.
[2:07:06] Give me the word.
[2:07:11] Make it plain and clear to me. Give me
[2:07:15] the word.
[2:07:19] It's a light that I might see. Give me
[2:07:23] the word.
[2:07:26] [Music]
[2:07:27] It's my total victory
[2:07:31] over every situation.
[2:07:35] First verse.
[2:07:39] Now it's been tested. It's been tried.
[2:07:44] Search and minds are satisfied.
[2:07:48] Though the stories old, the message
[2:07:51] still is true.
[2:07:56] Oh, it's been ridiculed.
[2:07:58] It's been chained. Still its power never
[2:08:02] changed.
[2:08:04] It will stand the test forever. Just
[2:08:08] give me the word. Can we stand to our
[2:08:10] feet and sing? Give me the word.
[2:08:16] Make it plain and clear to me. Give me
[2:08:20] the word.
[2:08:24] It's the light that I might see. Give me
[2:08:28] the word.
[2:08:30] [Music]
[2:08:32] It's my total victory
[2:08:36] over every situation.
[2:08:41] Sing that again. Over every situation,
[2:08:48] give me the word.
[2:08:51] Over every situation,
[2:08:56] give me the word.
[2:09:00] God bless you is our prayer.
[2:09:04] Oh, keep that word in your heart,
[2:09:06] church.
[2:09:08] Let it be the most precious thing to
[2:09:10] you.
[2:09:11] As brother Terry was saying today about
[2:09:14] revelation. Revelation is the greatest
[2:09:16] thing. God give it to us.
[2:09:20] Hallelujah.
[2:09:22] God bless you. Uh we're going to be
[2:09:25] having baptism
[2:09:28] right after the service. So if you'd
[2:09:30] like to be a witness to this, uh we'll
[2:09:35] have it in the back there, of course.
[2:09:37] But um God bless you. Love you.
[2:09:40] Appreciate you. May you have a wonderful
[2:09:42] week in the Lord. And uh we want to
[2:09:45] remember service uh 7:00
[2:09:49] Wednesday. And um also, Lord willing,
[2:09:53] we'll be having prayer service tomorrow
[2:09:55] night for those that would like to come
[2:09:58] and be a part of that. Amen. And I think
[2:10:02] prayer is is essential in our Christian
[2:10:06] walk. Amen. So, prayer service 7:00
[2:10:10] tomorrow night. So, God bless you. Let's
[2:10:14] just bow our heads in a word of prayer.
[2:10:18] Precious Father,

[2:10:24] the
