[0:05] and enjoyed the songs that were sung and
[0:08] the worship and appreciate our musicians
[0:12] amen and their labor amen and good to
[0:17] have brother Berkeley with us amen and
[0:19] uh
[0:20] God bless you I didn't even know you
[0:22] could sing amen you got a good voice
[0:24] praise the Lord and enjoyed that and
[0:28] amen and again it's a good to have
[0:33] Suzanne with us my mother-in-law and
[0:36] we've really enjoyed and having her with
[0:40] us and been able to fellowship with her
[0:43] and so she'll be heading home Friday
[0:46] morning the Lord willing and so we want
[0:49] to keep her in prayer that she have a
[0:51] safe flight back home and and
[0:54] that the Lord is good to us if you have
[0:57] your Bibles we're going to
[0:59] turn to Psalms the 23rd chapter
[1:05] amen
[1:09] read a few verses there
[1:12] amen I trust everyone had a good day
[1:15] today in the Lord and
[1:21] but before we go into the word may we
[1:24] just bow our heads and talk to our Lord
[1:27] father
[1:30] we truly thank you for all that you've
[1:33] done for us and
[1:35] we can never thank you enough
[1:38] Lord and just to be able to come to your
[1:42] house and to worship you
[1:44] to magnify you Lord and to
[1:48] Lord just to wash ourselves with your
[1:51] word
[1:52] father for the prophet said it's the
[1:55] bloody bleeding word
[1:57] Lord and knowing father that As we judge
[2:03] ourselves here by your word we won't
[2:07] stand on that day of judgment
[2:10] Lord without any blood without any Mercy
[2:15] father and help us all Lord just to draw
[2:18] closer to you for that's our desire Lord
[2:22] and as you draw us Lord may we respond
[2:25] promptly Lord
[2:27] and I pray Lord that you would move
[2:29] among us this evening anoint me Lord I I
[2:34] need you
[2:35] father it's your gift it's it has
[2:39] nothing to do with me Lord and may we
[2:43] just come into a higher place with you
[2:46] father and anoint your people Lord to
[2:50] hear to receive is our prayer Lord that
[2:54] when we leave this place we had known
[2:56] that it did we had met with you we ask
[3:01] it in Jesus Christ's name and the church
[3:04] says amen
[3:06] Psalms 23
[3:09] um
[3:11] first verse the Lord is my shepherd
[3:16] I shall not want.
[3:19] he maketh me to lie down in Green
[3:21] Pastures he leadeth me beside the Still
[3:25] Waters
[3:26] he restoreth my soul
[3:30] amen you can have your seeds
[3:34] this evening
[3:36] we've been talking uh for a little bit
[3:40] now on this The Lord Is Our Shepherd
[3:44] and so this evening I want to continue
[3:47] dealing with it um
[3:50] the third verse
[3:52] he restoreth my soul but last last
[3:56] Wednesday we talked on restoring but
[4:00] tonight I want to just talk about the
[4:02] soul
[4:03] and um
[4:06] you know there are three stages of
[4:09] everything and and most of us we know
[4:11] these things and it's good to have
[4:13] Sister Lisa brother Andrew's Mom with us
[4:16] praise the Lord and
[4:19] um but it's uh um
[4:22] they're they're this it may be a simple
[4:25] subject to to many but yet I I think
[4:28] it's good just to go over these things
[4:31] and and to talk about them
[4:33] but there are three stages of everything
[4:36] as the prophet would tell us for such
[4:39] there's the the the the Mortal body then
[4:42] there is the theophany body and then
[4:45] there's the glorified body
[4:47] then we look at even in the coming of
[4:50] Christ is is in a trinity
[4:53] brother Branham says you know first he
[4:55] came to redeem his bride second he comes
[4:59] to receive his bride and then third he
[5:02] comes with his bride to reign as king
[5:05] and queen in the millennium
[5:08] and so brother Branham tells us that
[5:12] that three is perfection
[5:14] that God is perfected in three
[5:18] um father son and and Holy Ghost
[5:22] and man is also perfected in three uh
[5:26] and that is uh Body Spirit and soul
[5:30] so we are a a Triune being
[5:35] and so brother Branham says you live in
[5:37] a three-room house Body Spirit and soul
[5:42] and so God lived in Christ
[5:45] upon the Earth and Body Spirit and soul
[5:50] and and so God in a Trinity is One
[5:55] and without the Trinity then he's not
[5:58] God ain't that right
[6:00] that's what the prophet said and so none
[6:03] of us can be manifested
[6:06] uh without being a trinity
[6:09] amen you you you can't be a body and be
[6:13] manifested as a as a person uh by just
[6:17] being a body because without any of
[6:19] these three things together then we are
[6:23] uh uh we're not complete so if you if
[6:28] the prophet said if you didn't have a
[6:29] body then you'd just be a spirit and if
[6:33] you didn't have a spirit then you'd be
[6:34] nothing and if you didn't have a soul
[6:36] you'd be nothing
[6:39] so he says see God also is complete in
[6:42] the triunity of a being not triunity of
[6:47] beings but the one being in a triunity
[6:51] father Son and Holy Ghost manifests the
[6:56] one true and living God ain't that right
[6:59] now first Thessalonians 5 23 Paul tells
[7:05] us he says and the Very God of Peace
[7:08] sanctify you holy and I pray God your
[7:12] whole spirit
[7:13] and sow and body be preserved blameless
[7:18] unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ
[7:21] now so our our whole Triune being must
[7:27] be preserved blameless ain't that right
[7:31] and and so but David here is talking
[7:34] about the restoration of the Soul now
[7:37] man uh is a mammal he's a warm-blooded
[7:41] uh animal and so uh and that's what we
[7:45] are by our Earthly creation the body and
[7:49] so when when God made man he made man in
[7:52] his own image and and man being a spirit
[7:55] being but then God formed a body Out of
[8:00] the Dust of the earth ain't that right
[8:02] and he put man in that in that body and
[8:07] that body was made in the image of an
[8:09] animal so God as the prophet would say
[8:13] he gave man a uh uh feat like a bear and
[8:17] he gave him hands like the monkey and
[8:20] and all of these things but when God put
[8:23] the spirit of man in that body then the
[8:28] Bible says that he gave him a soul
[8:31] for God breathed the breath of life and
[8:35] Man became a living Soul ain't that
[8:38] right now there's a lot to this and so
[8:41] I'm going to try to get through it
[8:43] hopefully to make some sense to you but
[8:45] I want to continue on later on but
[8:48] brother Brown said that's the difference
[8:50] between man and and animal the animal is
[8:54] the soul that that's the difference and
[8:57] and so
[8:59] um uh again Genesis 2 7 and the Lord God
[9:02] formed a Man Out of the Dust of the
[9:04] ground formed his body and breathed into
[9:08] his nostrils the breath of life and Man
[9:10] became a living soul and so being that
[9:15] the the animal doesn't have a soul then
[9:19] he doesn't realize that he's naked he
[9:22] doesn't realize what sin is he he he
[9:26] doesn't know sin amen because he is a
[9:30] living being no not a living Soul ain't
[9:34] that right and so also the prophet would
[9:37] tell us that the animal does not know
[9:40] what life is Hereafter amen and he can't
[9:45] know because he doesn't have a soul and
[9:48] he says the reason that we long as
[9:50] humans we long for Life Hereafter it's
[9:54] it's because we've been given a a soul
[9:59] where the animal can't long for it a man
[10:02] and and God gave you a soul to make a
[10:06] decision amen that's that's where the
[10:09] intelligence comes from is the soul and
[10:13] and so the animal cannot make that
[10:16] decision because it has nothing in it to
[10:19] make ain't that right another thing
[10:21] about the soul the prophet says that the
[10:23] soul is the nature of the spirit and and
[10:27] so he says you are what you are are in
[10:32] your soul not in your mind not in your
[10:35] spirit not even in your body but in your
[10:38] soul see not in your mind and not in
[10:41] your reasoning and so brother Branham
[10:43] said you meet God with your soul ain't
[10:47] that right you're going to meet God with
[10:49] your soul and the way that soul is it
[10:54] produced what kind of life you are and
[10:57] if that life in you denies this word
[11:00] then get rid of it
[11:03] and get a life that will stay with that
[11:07] word and and God and make God live in
[11:11] you ain't that right so you you will
[11:14] meet God with your soul and that's
[11:16] important I I believe and and so even
[11:20] though even though that we are a Triune
[11:22] being bodies spirit and soul it's the
[11:27] soul that counts it's the soul that
[11:30] counts now we know that the outside man
[11:33] which is the body it has five senses
[11:35] stays filled hear smell in in sight and
[11:39] and and that is the the this body but
[11:43] then there's that Inside Man which is
[11:45] the spirit man and it's controlled by
[11:48] five senses you've got imagination
[11:50] reasoning uh conscience uh uh memory and
[11:56] and and the other one and and so uh but
[11:59] five senses all together but in on the
[12:03] inside of that Spirit brother Brandon
[12:05] would call it the inside of the inside
[12:07] and he says inside of that spirit is the
[12:12] soul and it is controlled by one thing
[12:15] and that's free will ain't that right so
[12:18] uh uh he he in another place he said the
[12:22] two Spirits he said now one of them
[12:24] there's only two spirits in the earth a
[12:27] man two powers and and so such two
[12:29] influences and and he says one of them
[12:32] is God's Holy Spirit and the other one
[12:35] is the devil Spirit working in deception
[12:39] ain't that right it's working in
[12:42] deception and the people of the Earth
[12:45] are now making their choice right now
[12:50] see and and remember you were given a
[12:52] soul a man to make that choice with to
[12:56] make decisions amen with and and so uh
[13:00] he said now the holy spirit is here
[13:02] today calling out a bride for Christ and
[13:07] he's doing it by vindicating his word
[13:09] now I you know people question and again
[13:12] this this Vindication then and all of
[13:15] this and it just blows my mind you know
[13:16] they're they're seeking Vindication
[13:18] about the cloud that that that was in
[13:21] Tucson and and uh uh one one uh minister
[13:25] is Consulting with Scientists to get a
[13:29] scientific statement a truth or fact
[13:33] from the scientist that this really
[13:35] happened that and I I just if that blows
[13:38] my mind amen because uh here the prophet
[13:41] would tell us that the Holy Spirit here
[13:44] is calling out a bride and he's doing it
[13:47] not by because the scientist agrees with
[13:49] it but he's doing it by vindicating his
[13:53] word a promise to her for this age
[13:57] showing that it is what Christ and
[14:01] brother Branham already told us that
[14:03] that them were seven angels and and in
[14:06] there it was Christ he said that's
[14:08] Christ can you say man and he pointed
[14:11] out the face of Jesus Christ amen but
[14:14] see it's by the Vindication of this word
[14:17] for this day that God is calling out a
[14:20] bride and Satan is working through
[14:23] deception and the people in this age are
[14:27] making their choice now I'll be honest
[14:29] with you as we go here I I don't think
[14:32] you've got too much long to make your
[14:34] choice you better be convinced uh you'll
[14:38] you'll either be convinced or you're not
[14:40] amen look at the politics look at what
[14:42] Russia is doing right now uh uh Russia
[14:45] they you know they they've been reading
[14:47] that Bible and and they've been reading
[14:49] Revelations and and one uh high up uh uh
[14:53] red uh uh scriptures uh concerning
[14:55] America and and they said we're ready to
[14:58] fulfill it we know our place in
[15:00] scripture and and so you know uh they're
[15:04] they're there and and I Know It looks
[15:06] like they got beaten in Ukraine amen but
[15:08] we already know what the prophet already
[15:10] said about Russia and if they're
[15:12] recognizing their place then there's a
[15:14] bride that's recognizing her position in
[15:16] in in in this life amen so playing games
[15:19] it's over we can't play games ain't that
[15:22] right amen so now now we're talking
[15:25] about that soul to to give and to make
[15:28] decisions aware he said you can accept
[15:31] what the devil says or you can accept
[15:34] what God Said What God Says and that'll
[15:37] determine what spirit is in there see if
[15:42] it's the spirit of God it'll feed on the
[15:44] things of God it won't feed on anything
[15:47] of the world can you say man now the
[15:51] soul is important the prophet tells us
[15:54] that that one soul is worth ten thousand
[15:59] worlds now you think of that one Soul
[16:02] Your Soul here tonight amen uh there may
[16:06] be 30 or so of us and and and every one
[16:09] of us has that soul and every soul is
[16:13] worth ten thousand worlds and the
[16:15] prophet said your soul means more than
[16:19] your body now you think of that your
[16:22] soul means more than your body brother
[16:24] Branham actually gave us a price tag on
[16:26] our body and he said it's only worth 84
[16:28] cents which inflation you know so you
[16:31] might might get up to a dollar fifty or
[16:33] something I don't know but but he's he's
[16:35] showing us how how cheap this whole body
[16:38] really is ain't that right amen and so
[16:42] when it comes to our body we aren't
[16:44] worth much but it's the soul everybody
[16:47] say it's the soul that God is working on
[16:50] it's the soul that matters to God Amen
[16:54] and why is that it's it's because in the
[16:58] Garden of Eden amen God and the devil
[17:01] chose what part of man that they would
[17:04] use and and and remember there's that
[17:07] war that began in heaven a man Satan
[17:10] started a revel uh Revolution or a
[17:13] rebellion uh against God then he was
[17:16] kicked out of heaven and then that
[17:18] battle uh uh continued here on on the
[17:22] earth and and and and and and man
[17:25] becomes the Battleground every one of us
[17:27] is the Battleground and so Satan chose
[17:31] man's head and and uh to use and and and
[17:35] uh uh uh his intellect and and God chose
[17:39] the man's heart the soul ain't that
[17:42] right for the soul doesn't live in your
[17:45] head the soul lives in your heart amen
[17:48] that's right and and so the prophet says
[17:51] the devil you know uh uh uh tries to
[17:55] show man uh with his mental Powers some
[18:00] great thing that he can do amen and so
[18:03] that that's what man uh with his
[18:05] intellect his intellectual Powers uh uh
[18:09] shows him what he can do and man only
[18:11] wants to see with his eyes ain't that
[18:14] right uh what he can see around him but
[18:17] notice the prophet said see God Amen
[18:20] chose man's heart for himself to live in
[18:23] amen God God wants to live in your heart
[18:27] and that's where the soul is he he wants
[18:29] your soul as his domain ain't that right
[18:32] amen see and so man God comes into man's
[18:36] heart and makes him believe for things
[18:39] that he cannot see now you think of that
[18:42] amen and only only God when he comes
[18:45] into that Soul can can man actually see
[18:48] things that he cannot see a man but he
[18:52] sees it by faith ain't that right he
[18:54] sees it by faith and II Corinthians 4
[18:57] 18. Paul would tell us we look knock at
[19:01] the things which are seen But at the
[19:03] things which are not seen that that's
[19:05] why we don't go by feelings we don't go
[19:07] by what we see what we you know what we
[19:10] feel what we hear what symptoms we have
[19:13] what it looks like we don't we don't
[19:15] look at the situation we look at the
[19:18] thing that is not seen ain't that right
[19:21] for the things notice the things which
[19:24] are seen are temporal amen now you you
[19:27] we look at the trees that's temporal we
[19:29] look at we look at the the the the
[19:31] houses that's temporal we look at the
[19:34] cars that's temporal but what what about
[19:36] what you see inside of you amen you see
[19:40] yourself as just a nobody that's
[19:42] temporal can you say man you might see
[19:44] yourself as a failure but that's
[19:46] temporal look at the things that are not
[19:49] seen ain't that right amen see so we we
[19:53] uh the things that can be seen are
[19:57] temporal but the things which are not
[19:59] seen are are Eternal ain't that right
[20:02] amen and that settles it so the prophet
[20:06] would tell us say we don't question it
[20:08] amen we just believe it because God said
[20:11] so God said it we believe it without any
[20:15] question ain't that right that's why we
[20:17] do not allow room for questions about
[20:19] this about the the this message and
[20:22] about the cloud and about the the the
[20:24] picture and and the promises that God
[20:27] made ain't that right amen no believer
[20:30] has questions about this message it's
[20:33] the unbeliever that has questions about
[20:35] this message can you say amen amen
[20:38] because the when God gets in your soul
[20:40] it'll make you a Believer it it just
[20:43] automatically does you are a Believer
[20:45] not by your intellect but you are a
[20:48] Believer from your soul ain't that right
[20:51] see so we we find a man that uh uh when
[20:56] when God gets into a man's heart that
[20:59] soul he doesn't have to see anything
[21:01] amen he doesn't have to have the doctor
[21:04] to give him a good report to for him to
[21:07] believe that he's healed he don't have
[21:10] to see anything positive a man for him
[21:13] to actually believe that he's going to
[21:15] walk again or or or or or that that that
[21:18] that the tumor is going to leave or or
[21:20] whatever he just already anchored in his
[21:24] soul
[21:25] ain't that right and so none of the five
[21:28] senses of the body must declare it to be
[21:31] so in order for him to believe it amen
[21:34] brother Branham says he just believes it
[21:37] in his soul where God lives amen see God
[21:42] wants to lead man to the path of worship
[21:46] ain't that right so so the devil took
[21:50] man's head and makes him smart a man to
[21:54] where he figures out his own religion he
[21:57] he
[21:58] um he figures it all out himself and
[22:02] makes his own way of Escape amen and
[22:05] we've read this before but brother
[22:07] Branham says you search the Bible and
[22:09] you show me where God ever dealt with
[22:12] intellectual people hunt for it and see
[22:15] if it isn't always the intellectuals
[22:17] that are devil possessed ain't that
[22:20] right because Satan uses the
[22:23] intellectual mind amen
[22:26] and God uses the soul now it was the
[22:30] soul of man that was marred a man by sin
[22:35] maybe if you were there
[22:38] um uh the day that Adam if you could
[22:40] have been there the day they they sinned
[22:42] amen you wouldn't have seen anything in
[22:45] the outward expression or in that in the
[22:48] body outwardly but but down inside of
[22:52] him that Soul become marred amen seek
[22:57] Blackness and darkness came into it
[23:00] brother Brown said that little cloud in
[23:02] there became marred and and black and
[23:05] and and see before sin came Adam and Eve
[23:10] oh my they they would you know wait just
[23:14] for uh the cool of the evening a man for
[23:18] God to come and fellowship with him and
[23:21] and God was anticipating the fellowship
[23:24] with this children in and oh my I don't
[23:28] know how long it was uh well I was a bit
[23:31] in a bit night after night after night
[23:33] oh they just looked for Fellowship one
[23:37] with another a man and and and these
[23:40] things and brother Brown said see what
[23:42] what it was is their soul was it marred
[23:45] a man so they could have fellowship and
[23:48] and and communion with God and so their
[23:52] soul wasn't marred they could hear the
[23:54] roar see that beautiful light shining
[23:57] through the bushes Yonder now you think
[24:00] of that amen because their soul was in
[24:03] contact with the supernatural their soul
[24:07] was in contact with the Unseen World
[24:10] ain't that right amen and you realize
[24:13] that God would meet with him just like
[24:15] that in the pillar of fire Amen in that
[24:18] Pillar of Fire amen would come roaring
[24:21] and you hear what brother Brandon would
[24:22] say it would be
[24:25] and what was it it was a wind it was a
[24:28] roar amen as that light would come down
[24:31] and settle and Adam and Eve because
[24:33] their soul was admired they could see it
[24:37] amen hang in there and and oh what a
[24:40] fellowship they would have ain't that
[24:43] right amen but see when the soul was
[24:46] marred amen it changed everything from
[24:48] man he he fell from his estate he he
[24:52] lost that consciousness of a
[24:54] supernatural Unseen World and he just
[24:57] lost consciousness of God and and what
[25:00] he was made for and and and before you
[25:03] know it he was trying his own religion
[25:05] he was trying his own way God would try
[25:08] to show up and he would take off running
[25:10] and hiding amen man's all the time
[25:13] hiding from the presence of the Lord
[25:15] amen see and so it's the soul that has
[25:20] to be changed back it it's the soul that
[25:24] has to be trans formed
[25:27] can you say amen and and I'll tell you
[25:30] this if the soul has no change there
[25:33] will be no body change
[25:35] can you say Amen just as much as the
[25:38] world today they they can't see much of
[25:41] a change in us today amen uh on the
[25:44] outward expression amen but what they
[25:47] can't see is there's a soul that's been
[25:49] transformed it's been changed back can
[25:52] you say Amen but but if the soul ain't
[25:55] changed there ain't going to be a change
[25:56] of a body the soul must be restored
[26:00] ain't that right now we put all of our
[26:03] time in making this body look good
[26:07] all right
[26:08] and and handsome men and Purdy and we
[26:13] put the best of clothes on we put you
[26:16] know the the we we we get the best of
[26:20] foods and put it down our body you know
[26:23] and and we we we we pet this old flesh
[26:27] and pet this old body and people will
[26:29] put two hundred dollar three hundred
[26:32] dollar hat on their head and and uh it's
[26:35] a uh you know and and the prophet says
[26:38] they might be clean uh through taking
[26:40] baths every four hours they they might
[26:43] be Paula Scholars and and all that on
[26:46] the outside and yet be as filthy and
[26:48] dirty as the smutty walls in hell in
[26:52] their soul can you say man amen so we're
[26:56] not looking a man took this whole body
[26:59] now you know uh I like good old steaks
[27:01] and I like all these things and and and
[27:04] uh uh we you know I'm I'm guilty just as
[27:07] much as petting this whole body amen but
[27:09] but this the soul that counts can you
[27:13] say Amen it's the soul people gauge your
[27:16] Christianity on whether you're poor
[27:18] whether you're rich or whether this or
[27:20] whether that and they disregard the soul
[27:23] of man now you know uh people will drag
[27:27] uh anything their soul through anything
[27:29] amen these days uh the prophet said the
[27:33] church has pulled their soul through too
[27:36] many old love story magazines instead of
[27:39] the word of God Amen he said people can
[27:42] tell you more about what movie star is
[27:45] popular then they can about the moving
[27:48] of the Holy Spirit they can tell you
[27:51] more about the news Amen in the politics
[27:54] more than they can the Holy Spirit they
[27:57] got more experience out amen with the
[27:59] world than they do the Holy Spirit can
[28:02] you say Amen uh uh and brother Brandon
[28:05] would say now if we would put more time
[28:07] to stay on Tuesday night and Wednesday
[28:10] night and going to church to prayer
[28:13] meeting instead of staying home and
[28:15] watching television on who loves Lucy or
[28:17] something like that and staying away
[28:19] from church we didn't know more about
[28:22] our Bible and what we're supposed to
[28:25] have in this day can you say Amen so so
[28:29] seed them things doesn't help your soul
[28:31] at all you're dragging your soul amen
[28:34] through the smuts of hell and and all of
[28:38] these things but yet we'll we make sure
[28:40] our bodies all petted you know we we
[28:42] tired and and so we want to go to bed
[28:45] early and and and make sure nobody you
[28:48] know does this there's no you know we we
[28:50] want everything just perfect
[28:51] everything's got to be just right amen
[28:54] but then that Soul amen we'll drag it
[28:57] through anything we don't care amen now
[28:59] brother Branham was talking to the uh uh
[29:02] uh the nominal church amen uh but but
[29:05] we're finding more and more is creeping
[29:08] in the message trains because of the
[29:10] mixed multitude that has followed and we
[29:13] we know what brother Branham says for
[29:15] every Supernatural display manifestation
[29:17] there's always a mixed multitude that
[29:20] follows it's the mixed multitude that
[29:23] causes the division is the mixed
[29:25] multitude that disbelieves the word of
[29:27] God is the mixed multitude a man that
[29:30] can't do that just can't accept every
[29:32] word that God has written in this Bible
[29:34] it's always the mixed multitude ain't
[29:36] that right and then he goes and
[29:38] continues on but we've got away God has
[29:42] given us churches and find pastors and
[29:45] Spirit-filled people amen that we're so
[29:48] grossed in our soul and fattened and fed
[29:51] till we just don't care for it anymore
[29:54] can you say Amen we just don't care for
[29:57] it amen now I thought of this because
[30:00] brother Branham at the end of a service
[30:03] and he was he was given an altar caller
[30:05] asking people to raise their hands and
[30:08] if they needed the Lord and and the 12
[30:11] year old a child raised his hand to
[30:15] accept Christ in his heart and brother
[30:18] Brown said God bless you sonny he said
[30:20] the Bible says a child shall lead them
[30:22] and see and he tells the people see he
[30:25] hasn't pulled his little soul through
[30:28] old true story magazines and things and
[30:32] and what's called true stories he said
[30:34] there's only one true story that I know
[30:37] and that's the Bible
[30:40] can you say amen he said little kids
[30:43] today know more about Davy Crockett they
[30:46] do about Jesus Christ and every 10 cent
[30:49] store has all kinds of cowboy stuff and
[30:52] he says and there's what the Little
[30:54] Children of America swallow up ain't
[30:57] that right but there was a little child
[30:58] a little boy a man that could raise his
[31:01] hands to accept Christ and the prophet
[31:03] would attribute it because his soul
[31:05] hadn't been drugged through all the
[31:08] nonsense can you say amen and and I I
[31:12] tell you Satan's got all kinds of
[31:13] enticing things in this day to drag your
[31:17] soul in amen that that's right to drag
[31:20] your soul through and and and and to be
[31:23] honest it makes a difference amen it
[31:26] makes a difference amen because people
[31:30] are becoming more indifferent to the
[31:33] word of God and to his word it makes
[31:36] them more calloused and irreverent to
[31:38] God I've never seen a generation so
[31:41] we're reverent to the things of God to
[31:43] the men of God Amen to the people of God
[31:45] that they'll they'll uh they'll smart
[31:48] they'll they'll act all kinds of ways
[31:50] and it doesn't even concern them we've
[31:53] had them walk in uh uh with mud in on
[31:55] their boots and when the deacons asked
[31:57] them not to do it they don't care amen
[32:00] it's just a it's a hardness it's a it's
[32:03] an irreverent Spirit you understand what
[32:06] I'm saying it makes it harder for God to
[32:08] reach them it makes it more harder for
[32:11] them to come into to relationship with
[32:13] God it makes it harder for them to pray
[32:16] it makes it harder for people to be
[32:19] attentive to the word of God as it's
[32:21] being preached and it's because they
[32:24] dragged their soul through all kinds of
[32:27] ungodliness and and all kinds of feel of
[32:31] the world even the prophet said they
[32:33] dragged their soul through religious
[32:35] junk
[32:37] can you say Amen you're all that
[32:39] religious doctrines and and man-made
[32:42] traditions and see they're dragging
[32:45] their soul through it amen to where
[32:47] America you can't even reach America
[32:50] anymore you can't reach people to Christ
[32:53] anymore because their soul has been
[32:56] drugged through so much
[33:02] brother Brown said take care of that
[33:04] soul
[33:05] and let that 84 cents go
[33:08] amen
[33:10] all right
[33:11] watch that soul
[33:13] for her to live forever
[33:16] your soul is more valuable than your
[33:19] wealth
[33:22] it's more valuable
[33:25] than the materialistic things that we
[33:27] hoard
[33:30] Mark 8 36 for what shall it profit a man
[33:35] if he shall gain the whole world and
[33:38] lose his own soul
[33:40] or what shall a man give in exchange for
[33:45] his soul ain't that right so what you
[33:49] are in your soul is what you will be
[33:53] when you leave here
[33:56] so I I hope I'm helping you
[33:58] amen I hope we're making some sense a
[34:00] little bit
[34:01] [Applause]
[34:02] all your money that you hoard up
[34:05] it's going to be at the bank when you
[34:07] die
[34:09] and all this materialistic things that
[34:11] you think you've got to have
[34:13] to enjoy life is going to just be a
[34:16] waste when you die
[34:18] but the thing that you disregard and
[34:22] most American laodicea is is pushing
[34:25] aside is the very Soul that's going to
[34:28] have to meet God one of these days
[34:31] ain't that right
[34:33] amen now the prophet says God is
[34:36] interested in the soul of man
[34:40] Leviticus 17 11 for the life of the
[34:44] flesh is in the blood then I have given
[34:47] it to you upon the altar to make an
[34:50] atonement for your soul for it is the
[34:55] blood that maketh an atonement for the
[34:57] soul
[34:58] yeah ain't that right Matthew 11 28 come
[35:02] unto me Jesus says all ye that labor and
[35:05] are heavy laden and I will give you rest
[35:08] amen see I will give you rest
[35:11] everybody's so tired these days and and
[35:13] all that you know what I I really think
[35:16] it's because it's the spirit world that
[35:19] is Laden on the people amen they know
[35:22] judgments coming and people ain't ready
[35:25] for it you understand what I'm saying
[35:26] and they get weary they get wither weary
[35:30] of the oppression they get weary of of
[35:33] all these things that and and and and
[35:35] and and here Jesus is saying to learn of
[35:39] me take my yoke upon you and for I am
[35:42] meek and lowly in heart and you shall
[35:45] find rest for what your soul amen you
[35:50] can sleep 24 hours a day amen but what
[35:53] you really need is rest for your soul
[35:57] can you say amen amen that that's what
[36:00] people need the world needs is rest unto
[36:03] their soul now Jesus here he was after
[36:06] that soul and and he was the expression
[36:10] of God's love ain't that right amen and
[36:13] and so if he's that expression then you
[36:16] you know that in his heart it was for
[36:19] souls in his heart he was burdened I got
[36:22] to get a soul I I you of course he said
[36:24] I'm at my father's business ain't that
[36:26] right so of course Souls was his
[36:28] business amen and and so we we looked
[36:32] amen uh uh where in the Bible that he
[36:35] got into a little ship and and he was
[36:38] crossing the sea and and and the winds
[36:41] picked up and you know you know who
[36:43] started them wins it was old Satan
[36:45] himself Satan knew why Satan knew what
[36:48] was happening but Jesus endured it Jesus
[36:51] wouldn't go back amen he just kept on
[36:54] pressing and pressing and and and and
[36:56] for of course we we know that he he
[36:59] spoke to the winds and this and the
[37:01] waves and all of that peace be still but
[37:03] he was willing to go to the other side
[37:06] because of one Soul was calling him can
[37:12] you say Amen One Soul was calling for
[37:14] him amen and the prophet said he had to
[37:17] go so to save that one's soul to heal
[37:21] one person and brother Brown said he
[37:24] would come from glory to Shreveport amen
[37:26] he would come to Blacksburg tonight from
[37:29] glory for one so can you say man that
[37:33] was ready to receive him sometimes we
[37:36] think it's God that we're waiting on God
[37:38] that's a lie don't let the devil lie to
[37:40] you amen every time a man a real true
[37:43] repented heart comes through that altar
[37:45] God is already there before he gets to
[37:47] that altar
[37:49] you understand what I'm saying we ain't
[37:52] waiting God to feel people with the Holy
[37:54] Ghost God's wanting to fill you with the
[37:56] Holy Ghost before the foundation of the
[37:58] world
[38:02] brother says I preached to hundreds of
[38:04] thousands I preached at just four or
[38:06] five people but I wouldn't be any more
[38:09] sincere with 500 000 than I would be
[38:11] with five people because one soul is
[38:15] valued to God as ten thousand worlds
[38:17] ain't that right and he said wherever
[38:19] the Lord sins the church never gets too
[38:21] little whatever it is it doesn't get too
[38:24] little right amen but whatever wherever
[38:28] there's a needy Soul he says I want to
[38:32] lead it if it's just one soul to the
[38:35] Lord Jesus and you may not be the
[38:37] preacher of of of
[38:38] Omega Church you may not be a a
[38:40] well-known individual but one Soul One
[38:44] Soul matters to God one soul that soul
[38:48] may be on your job that means that's
[38:50] cool that soul may be a uh uh at your
[38:53] school that soul may be at the at the
[38:55] grocery store that soul may be at the at
[38:58] the barber shop wherever it is one soul
[39:02] God's interested in Souls
[39:05] don't forget it
[39:11] I remember reading the story of Smith
[39:14] Wigglesworth his biography and
[39:18] he was at someone's house he was
[39:20] ministering in that in the town I
[39:22] believe and so he was staying at an
[39:24] individuals home families home
[39:26] but one morning woke up and felt like
[39:28] the Lord wanted him to walk to town so
[39:30] he walked
[39:32] and he kept walking and and he felt led
[39:35] to stop and there was a bench so he sat
[39:37] on that bench and it was by the busty
[39:40] Pole or or yeah I think it was that
[39:42] they're trained or whatever and
[39:44] but he waited there waited there for
[39:46] hours
[39:48] maybe four hours
[39:50] and he thought well maybe I've missed
[39:51] the Lord
[39:52] and it's getting ready to leave
[39:55] but he just felt something certain that
[39:58] that God wanted him to witness to
[40:00] somebody
[40:01] [Music]
[40:03] and as he looked there's an individual
[40:05] got off that train and the Lord led him
[40:07] to that individual
[40:10] and Smith Wigglesworth went over there
[40:12] and introduced himself to that
[40:14] individual and began to talk to him
[40:16] about the Lord and let that soul
[40:19] to the Lord
[40:21] [Music]
[40:22] and you say Amen you hear that many
[40:25] times of brother Branham
[40:27] you hear it of even Jesus where Jesus
[40:29] went out of his way to Samaria
[40:33] I don't know how many hours he had to
[40:35] wait
[40:37] but maybe he waited a little while
[40:40] maybe there were other women that came
[40:42] but he knew there was one soul
[40:45] that was crying out for help
[40:48] One Soul
[40:50] and here this woman was a harlot but it
[40:52] never decreased the value of her soul
[40:56] can you say Amen
[40:58] the prophet tells us that salvation is
[41:00] much greater
[41:02] salvation of the soul is much greater
[41:05] than the healing of the body
[41:08] ain't that right a man can be healed in
[41:10] his physical body only for a limited
[41:12] time
[41:13] but when God Saves the soul
[41:17] it's for eternity
[41:19] ain't that right
[41:21] so we could go on about value of a soul
[41:25] you know the the value I thought of the
[41:29] money
[41:30] now money our money is just going up and
[41:33] down up and down and it's you know it's
[41:36] it's really just decreasing in value
[41:39] you look at your vehicles you look at
[41:41] the houses that you buy and and they
[41:44] lose its value
[41:46] if there's only one thing that doesn't
[41:47] lose value and that's a soul
[41:51] can you say man
[41:53] and I pray to God that we can get so
[41:57] burdened for Souls
[42:01] hello
[42:02] get so burdened for Souls
[42:05] Amen brother Brandon says one soul is is
[42:08] saved is worth it whether it is a little
[42:11] black boy in Africa or a prostitute in
[42:14] New York in
[42:16] eternity when that star is shining
[42:18] Yonder our name will be attached to it
[42:22] can you say man that's where the value
[42:24] is is in the soul it isn't how much you
[42:28] got or how much you desire it's how much
[42:30] you can do towards saving souls for
[42:34] Christ
[42:35] ain't that right he said if I get a soul
[42:37] safe for Christ brother as long as
[42:39] there's an eternity the glory of God
[42:42] will rest on that Soul amen that's right
[42:45] see so so they ought to see it is put
[42:48] into everything before that should not
[42:50] be hey they're putting value on things
[42:53] that are corrupt amen where God wants us
[42:56] to put the value and I believe if the
[42:58] spirit of God is within us amen it will
[43:01] put the value where it belongs can you
[43:05] say man and that's on Souls
[43:07] you hear Brother Brad I'm talking about
[43:09] you know uh uh souls in prison and at
[43:12] the end he said Is it true yeah it can
[43:14] it be so that that that that that we're
[43:16] at that time where where where that no
[43:20] more can be saved and he said well if it
[43:21] is what about Sarah what about my
[43:23] children what about that but did you
[43:25] know as he's asking him questions he
[43:28] ain't planning on stopping his campaigns
[43:30] he ain't planning on stopping preaching
[43:32] he ain't planning on stopping everything
[43:35] amen saying well I feel in my soul that
[43:38] this may be it no no no he kept on
[43:40] pressing the battle he kept on preaching
[43:43] he kept on singing and he kept on doing
[43:46] what he needed to do for one Soul can
[43:49] you say amen and I don't know where
[43:51] we're at it well you know we we may be
[43:53] at the place that you can't get another
[43:55] soul in that God has never showed me
[43:57] that God has never showed you back don't
[44:00] you let some mind amen convert you into
[44:03] that amen get after a soul and witness
[44:05] amen God's placed you on the job for
[44:08] some reason God's placed you somewhere
[44:10] for some reason whether it's in the
[44:12] school whether it's in a hospital
[44:13] whether it's in I don't know where you
[44:16] where we're at but God places his people
[44:18] there for a soul
[44:26] brother Brown said remember Eternal
[44:28] things is what is what lasts forever and
[44:30] that's getting so saved
[44:32] let that be the first thing of all your
[44:34] work all your ideas and all your motives
[44:37] hello
[44:39] he said I'd rather have one soul and
[44:41] Glory that I won to Christ and to know
[44:42] and see that the light of God circles
[44:45] around that Soul through all eternity my
[44:47] name to be associated with that than to
[44:49] have every penny of money in the whole
[44:51] world because I could lose all of it and
[44:53] you know good and well there's been
[44:55] millionaires billionaires amen that is
[44:57] reveled in in all their money in the
[45:00] lottery and they've been broken amen
[45:02] within one night's time amen and and
[45:05] they despair they don't know what to do
[45:07] amen they lost it oh
[45:13] man
[45:14] brother Brown said it used to be that if
[45:17] someone come to the altar give their
[45:18] heart to the Lord or to rededicate their
[45:21] life
[45:22] the whole church
[45:23] will come together around that soul
[45:27] and pray him through
[45:31] he said it's because they were thankful
[45:33] to God that a soul had come
[45:37] they said you don't see that anymore
[45:40] he said because we've lost all the Zeal
[45:42] that we've ever had
[45:44] can you say Amen
[45:47] now I'm going to continue on for a few
[45:49] more moments
[45:52] but brother Branham says the soul
[45:53] controls the spirit
[45:56] and the spirit controls the body
[46:01] and the soul is the nature of the spirit
[46:06] can you say Amen
[46:07] so he said you take two brothers for
[46:09] example you know one of them be John Doe
[46:13] and the other is Jack Doe
[46:15] we'll say and and and their their
[46:19] brothers John is a body Spirit Soul Jack
[46:22] is a body spirit and soul
[46:25] but John you know he's just mean he's
[46:28] evil he's he has everything about him is
[46:31] is just evil
[46:33] and and so he cheats steals lies commits
[46:37] adultery and and does just any evil
[46:40] thing that he can do
[46:42] amen but but Jack doe is is full of Joys
[46:46] full of love he's full of Happiness he's
[46:48] full of peace and and all these things
[46:51] and yet both of them have a body Soul
[46:53] and Spirit both of them are that way
[46:56] ain't that right and and and so what is
[46:59] the difference between the two well
[47:01] brother Brown says see the the nature
[47:03] that John has is evil and the nature
[47:07] that that Jack would have is is good can
[47:10] you say Amen talking about the soul
[47:12] ain't that right amen and and so God
[47:16] must get into the soul
[47:18] I want you to get this for a moment now
[47:20] and as as we get ready to close but God
[47:23] gets into the soul Matthew 5 4 5 45
[47:28] Jesus said he maketh his Reign or his
[47:31] son to rise talking of God to rise on
[47:35] the evil and on the good and sendeth
[47:38] Reign on the just and on the unjust
[47:42] ain't that right now brother Branham
[47:45] would teach us that a man's spirit is
[47:48] between the soul and the body a man and
[47:52] can be absolutely truly Anointed with
[47:57] the Holy Ghost
[47:58] brother Rand says they can anoint this
[48:01] Spirit to make the outside body come
[48:04] into subjection to the spirit
[48:07] ain't that right now remember it's the
[48:10] spirit that controls the body the soul
[48:12] controls the spirit the spirit controls
[48:15] the body see he says but the soul that
[48:19] rejects in unbelief the word of God
[48:23] shall die
[48:24] now you think of that a a man that is
[48:28] dancing Anointed with the spirit of God
[48:31] true spirit of God in his spirit amen
[48:35] that is religious amen and even his body
[48:39] is is is has the outward appearance of
[48:43] religion
[48:44] yeah
[48:45] and and his spirit is Anointed in and
[48:49] having a good feeling and dancing and
[48:52] shouting and just having a good time and
[48:55] yet he says that outside Spirit can be
[48:58] Anointed with the Holy Ghost and the
[49:00] Soul be as dark as pitch
[49:05] and you say Amen
[49:08] now listen now
[49:09] because I I want you to understand He
[49:13] restored my soul
[49:17] David David's not talking about a lot of
[49:20] these Pentecostals
[49:21] that is Anointed in his spirit
[49:24] having good thoughts a good time in
[49:26] church and yet that Soul on the outside
[49:30] when they get outside of churches is
[49:32] smutty and black and controlling that
[49:34] Spirit around
[49:40] you know brother rounds that sin is
[49:42] hypocrisy
[49:44] hypocritical right
[49:47] now I think of this Rich Young Ruler who
[49:50] was very religious
[49:52] brother Ram said his church his
[49:54] intelligence his education and all had
[49:57] led him to a success
[50:00] and all the Jews loved him he gave him
[50:03] gave to them he helped them he might
[50:06] have done this that or the other
[50:07] but see he came face to face with the
[50:10] Vindicated word of the hour
[50:13] ain't that right and he had the
[50:15] opportunity to follow Jesus he had the
[50:18] opportunity to gain eternal life
[50:22] amen but he went his own way refusing
[50:26] the leadership of Vindicated word
[50:30] that's what the prophet said
[50:32] ain't that right the leadership of Jesus
[50:34] Christ now now we'll find him in Luke 12
[50:38] and 16. Jesus said that this rich young
[50:41] man brought forth plentifully naturally
[50:45] plentifully and he thought within
[50:47] himself saying what shall I do because I
[50:49] have no room where to bestow my fruits
[50:52] and he said this will I do I will pull
[50:55] down my Barns and build greater and
[50:57] there will I bestow all my fruits and my
[51:00] goods and I will say to my soul so thou
[51:04] Hast much Goods laid up for many years
[51:06] take thine ease eat drink and be merry
[51:10] in that laodicea today
[51:12] but God would say unto him thou full
[51:16] this night thy Soul shall be required of
[51:20] Thee
[51:22] then who shall those things be which
[51:25] thou has provided
[51:29] then you say Amen while the world
[51:31] laodicea is taking rest
[51:34] got their yachts
[51:36] they got their nice cards
[51:38] they got their air-conditioned homes
[51:40] they got it all anything they want they
[51:43] got it and if they ain't got the money
[51:45] for it they got the credit card for it
[51:48] that's right and it's a credit card
[51:51] ain't doing it welfare we'll do it
[51:54] we are so at ease in Zion
[51:59] can you say amen and while they're
[52:01] taking it easy
[52:03] there's a bomb waiting for us
[52:06] written with America's USA can you say
[52:09] man better here God would say notice not
[52:13] not requiring what you stored up I ain't
[52:15] God ain't requiring that God ain't
[52:17] requiring your boats and your fancy
[52:19] houses and your fancy clothes and your
[52:22] fancy hats and and your fancy hairdos he
[52:26] ain't he ain't gonna require that he's
[52:28] going to require of your soul
[52:30] I gave you a soul what did you do with
[52:33] it I gave you a soul what did you invest
[52:36] with it
[52:39] can you say Amen
[52:40] listen now this man was very religious
[52:43] he kept the Commandments from his you
[52:45] but his soul had never been transformed
[52:53] so what he done is he whitewashed
[52:54] everything
[52:56] ain't that right
[52:58] he whitewashed everything else but his
[53:00] soul was black
[53:01] he couldn't whitewash the soul
[53:04] now notice brother Brown would tell us
[53:06] now because we just read about the rain
[53:08] and falling on the just and the unjust
[53:11] he said the same water that puts life
[53:13] into the wheat also puts life into the
[53:16] cockover
[53:18] but at the bottom of the cockover it's a
[53:20] of her life
[53:22] right
[53:23] so the rain you you plant your garden
[53:26] amen and and you're waiting for that
[53:29] rain to fall on that Garden because you
[53:31] sowed your seeds but that rain is not
[53:34] only benefiting amen your your vegetable
[53:38] your tomatoes and your potatoes and your
[53:40] your your all your eight is or whatever
[53:43] see he it's not only benefiting that but
[53:46] the grass is growing the Thorns are
[53:47] growing and and everything else is
[53:50] growing can you say Amen everything is
[53:52] benefiting but the rain doesn't turn
[53:55] your grass into cucumber
[53:58] that's great
[53:59] ain't that right the rain doesn't turn
[54:03] the weeds into broccoli
[54:09] so here he says see it's just Caulk of
[54:11] our life it's rejoicing and blooming and
[54:14] got life and doing everything that the
[54:16] wheat does but the soul of it is Cocker
[54:20] Burr
[54:22] [Music]
[54:23] and here that's where we're at now false
[54:26] teachers false prophets false christs
[54:30] for us anointed ones
[54:33] can you say amen he said see teaching
[54:36] all kinds of trinitarianism and
[54:38] everything else and be Anointed with the
[54:40] Holy Ghost
[54:43] and can even manifest the fruits of the
[54:45] spirit
[54:46] [Music]
[54:49] can you say amen and everything else and
[54:52] be Anointed with the Holy Ghost and
[54:54] perform just as many miracles as the
[54:56] true gospel can but by the word here
[54:59] that's what does it
[55:01] how do they respond to the Vindicated
[55:04] word of the hour
[55:09] they have all the emotion that the real
[55:11] Revival has
[55:14] they shout they scream they dance and
[55:16] the prophet said they really get
[55:18] something out of that anointing
[55:24] hope that's all right
[55:26] brother Brown said I was out there in
[55:28] Africa one day
[55:30] some of the kids was talking about these
[55:32] rock and roll songs that Elvis Presley
[55:34] and them was singing
[55:36] Pat Boone and whatever more Ricky Nelson
[55:38] and all them others
[55:40] he said I told him they're a bunch of
[55:41] Renegades
[55:43] I'll tell you what it still stands today
[55:48] there are a bunch of Renegades
[55:50] these people that can go out there and
[55:52] sing country songs and come back and
[55:54] sing gospel songs they're Renegades
[55:57] Randy Travis a renegade
[55:59] [Applause]
[56:01] and I know we got young people that
[56:03] likes that guy he's a renegade
[56:07] he's nothing but Elvis Presley again
[56:12] can you say Amen
[56:15] and and we can go into even in the in
[56:17] these southern gospel groups too The
[56:19] Isaacs are even starting to sing uh
[56:21] ungodly songs Renegades
[56:26] I've just I've just been truthful with
[56:29] you now
[56:31] there's there's so many grooves that are
[56:33] turning in because they're they're
[56:35] losing they're losing popularity in the
[56:38] Christian world and now they got to go
[56:40] out and get this secular World their
[56:43] Renegades all right
[56:47] so they're talking about Elvis Presley
[56:49] all these guys and some little girl said
[56:51] but why he's very religious and I said
[56:53] so was Judas and I said Judas got only
[56:56] 30 got only got 30 pieces of silver
[56:59] Elvis Presley got several million
[57:01] dollars they both sold out their
[57:03] birthrights
[57:05] he said and that's the very worst
[57:07] indentment this nation's got still just
[57:09] as deceiving as the filter of the
[57:12] cigarette these denominations let those
[57:14] members come in they ought to even be
[57:17] says there ought to be a law there ought
[57:20] to be a law that they couldn't sing
[57:22] religious songs
[57:24] ought to be against the law for them to
[57:25] do it can you say Amen but listen he
[57:28] says the whole thing has become one
[57:31] great big pile of hypocrisy there's
[57:33] where they stay today
[57:36] ain't that right the Bible says if you
[57:38] love the world the things of the world
[57:40] the love of God is not even in you he
[57:43] said you cannot say that rock and roll
[57:45] is of god rock and roll is of the world
[57:48] in any of those dances and nasty filthy
[57:52] things is of the world it's all of the
[57:54] world you can't say that bobbed hair uh
[57:57] uh for a woman is of God the Bible says
[58:00] it's not so it's the filth of the world
[58:03] and if you love one Speck of the world
[58:05] the love of God is Not In You Now
[58:07] where's that at it's in the soul can you
[58:11] say Amen but you'll see them bobbed hair
[58:13] preaching you'll see them bob hair
[58:15] dancing and saying the Lord spoke to me
[58:17] and they're speaking in tongues but
[58:19] we're talking about the soul of man
[58:21] really changed
[58:23] the soul the soul
[58:27] it's that Soul can you say man
[58:30] now David's not a hypocrite
[58:32] for he said he restoreth my soul
[58:37] I hope this is all right
[58:42] the love of God is not even in you he
[58:44] said what's that well what's drawing it
[58:47] see it's something down inside drawing
[58:50] the soul is drawing your resource
[58:52] through the outside down through the
[58:54] spirit into the soul and if the soul
[58:57] loves the world it's dead
[59:00] I don't care how annoying how it's
[59:02] anointed it is out here in your spirit
[59:05] realm and how righteous is out here in
[59:09] that Spirit realm down in your soul it's
[59:12] dead
[59:15] and they're like these saw was
[59:19] outwardly he was okay outwardly he was
[59:21] religious I would say he was the guy you
[59:23] would pick
[59:26] Kane was religious on the outside Balaam
[59:28] was religious on the outside Judas
[59:31] religious on the outside
[59:33] and when it came to religion Esau seemed
[59:35] to be more religious than Jacob was
[59:37] he seemed to be the better man than
[59:39] Jacob
[59:40] can you say Amen
[59:42] but now get to the soul
[59:45] that's what made the difference
[59:48] can you say Amen
[59:50] now brother Bradham would tell us he was
[59:52] outwardly religious talking to these so
[59:54] I'll bet his thinking was not filtered
[59:57] he didn't think right of the birthright
[59:59] he didn't think that the birthright
[1:00:01] meant as much as God said it did and so
[1:00:05] many people just don't think God really
[1:00:07] means what he says he does
[1:00:09] and they'll they'll pervert it they'll
[1:00:11] twist it around they'll let some guy
[1:00:12] talk him out of it and convince him that
[1:00:14] it's not right it's not true and and and
[1:00:16] and and all it's just nonsense
[1:00:20] you understand what I'm saying amen but
[1:00:22] see he says there he was and he said I'm
[1:00:25] hungry what difference does it make
[1:00:26] about the old Birthright you can have it
[1:00:28] if you want it oh my I go to church I'm
[1:00:31] just as good as you are my denomination
[1:00:33] is just as well yes one of the greatest
[1:00:34] in the world my mother belongs to it my
[1:00:36] father belonged to it all this that and
[1:00:38] the other my pastor was educated he got
[1:00:40] so so you know so and so that puts him
[1:00:43] much farther from God
[1:00:46] ain't that right
[1:00:48] amen notice
[1:00:50] is this okay
[1:00:52] Balaam the prophet said Nate and Balaam
[1:00:55] was anointed with the same holy spirit
[1:00:58] that Moses was
[1:01:01] now listen to that
[1:01:03] but Moses was a man sent from God with
[1:01:07] the word of God
[1:01:10] amen now let's look brother Brandon says
[1:01:12] what is the difference what was the
[1:01:14] difference between
[1:01:15] Moses and Bala
[1:01:18] the teaching of Moses was perfect
[1:01:27] I know we got a lot of anointing men
[1:01:29] around here
[1:01:31] got their tooting their little horns
[1:01:36] and they want to tell us that brother
[1:01:37] Brown's Ministry wasn't perfect
[1:01:42] in that just like Balaam
[1:01:44] they failed to see the smitten Rock
[1:01:47] he failed to see the pillar of Fire
[1:01:50] he failed to see the atonement
[1:01:53] and he started pulling all the pointing
[1:01:56] out all the faults and nitpicking the
[1:01:58] church
[1:02:00] can you say Amen
[1:02:02] but here a prophet is saying but the
[1:02:04] teaching of Moses was perfect
[1:02:07] and I say the teaching of William
[1:02:08] Branham is perfect
[1:02:11] these others may be anointed just as
[1:02:13] much but the teaching is perfect
[1:02:17] can you say Amen the Bible said here in
[1:02:21] second Peter that it was the teaching of
[1:02:23] Balaam that Israel received that God
[1:02:26] never did forgive
[1:02:28] unpardonable sin
[1:02:30] see not a one of them got saved out of
[1:02:33] all that preaching neither one of them
[1:02:34] oh they come to the altar they shave
[1:02:36] their tear they've done it all they
[1:02:38] wrote on the floor and not on one of
[1:02:39] them getting saved
[1:02:43] amen you're with me oh they're having
[1:02:46] their revivals what they call revivals
[1:02:51] not one of them getting saved
[1:02:55] though they had come out under out under
[1:02:57] the blessings of God and seen the hand
[1:03:00] of God moving by this Mighty prophet and
[1:03:03] seen it exactly Vindicated by god notice
[1:03:07] it's the same thing today
[1:03:10] ain't that right
[1:03:11] and because another Prophet come in with
[1:03:14] a teaching contrary and disputed with
[1:03:18] Moses and tried to prove to the people
[1:03:20] that Moses was wrong it aren't they
[1:03:23] doing that today
[1:03:26] and Nathan Cora and many of them agreed
[1:03:29] with him and taught the children of
[1:03:31] Israel to commit fornication to go after
[1:03:34] his organization that we're all the same
[1:03:37] we're all the same let's all just love
[1:03:40] let's not offend people we're all the
[1:03:42] same hogwash
[1:03:44] that's a teaching of Balaam that's the
[1:03:48] teaching that the people went after and
[1:03:50] God never did forgive them
[1:03:54] then you say Amen well whether we're
[1:03:57] methodists Baptist Presbyterian
[1:03:58] Pentecostals want more we're all the
[1:04:00] same we are not the same you are a
[1:04:03] separated people holy unto the Lord
[1:04:06] dedicated to the word and the spirit of
[1:04:09] God to bear fruit of his promise of this
[1:04:12] day
[1:04:13] how many is dedicated for that
[1:04:15] that's what you were predestinated to
[1:04:18] that's what you were born for
[1:04:21] not to mingle your seed with the world
[1:04:28] you said you're not one of them
[1:04:30] I know that's awful strong but that's
[1:04:32] the truth just the same
[1:04:33] dedicated to a service in these last
[1:04:36] days come out from amongst it
[1:04:40] he said now the teaching of Balaam not
[1:04:42] the prophecy of Balaam remember that
[1:04:45] thank God for a prophet he's going to
[1:04:47] show you something now here Balaam was
[1:04:50] wrong in his teaching and yet he gave a
[1:04:52] prophecy and God blessed it God honored
[1:04:54] that prophecy because it was the
[1:04:57] teaching of Balaam that was wrong not
[1:04:58] the prophecy
[1:05:01] he said that was all right that was God
[1:05:06] he said the prophecy of Balaam was
[1:05:08] exactly right because he couldn't speak
[1:05:09] nothing else
[1:05:12] the anointing of God wouldn't speak
[1:05:14] nothing else
[1:05:15] the anointing God doesn't curse his
[1:05:17] people
[1:05:19] their world may want to curse you the
[1:05:22] world may want to call you a non-fit for
[1:05:24] heaven but the blessings are the
[1:05:26] anointing of God will never curse you
[1:05:30] not the bride not the people of God no
[1:05:32] no no no
[1:05:36] amen
[1:05:38] so the anointing of God wouldn't speak
[1:05:40] nothing else and God Vindicated it by
[1:05:42] proving it was the truth but it was the
[1:05:45] teaching of Balaam now compare that with
[1:05:47] Matthew 24 24 anointed ones but their
[1:05:51] teaching is false
[1:05:52] the trinities and all these things like
[1:05:55] that it's the wrong it's wrong it's
[1:05:57] Antichrist
[1:06:00] I know you know some of them don't think
[1:06:02] we ought to be singing songs that you
[1:06:04] know that the the worldly people write
[1:06:06] amen but they don't understand the
[1:06:08] anointing is there
[1:06:11] and that anointing is real using them
[1:06:13] gifts
[1:06:14] and they can write songs like like I
[1:06:17] pledge allegiance to the blood what's
[1:06:18] wrong with that song
[1:06:20] come on Church
[1:06:22] what's wrong with them songs that we
[1:06:24] sing about God and and worshiping God
[1:06:27] their teaching is wrong yes
[1:06:31] but if God can use Balaam God can still
[1:06:33] use people today
[1:06:35] we get so sophisticated in our minds
[1:06:38] that we just put a God in a box
[1:06:40] but the prophet are he told his false
[1:06:43] anointed ones
[1:06:45] they confuse us
[1:06:47] [Music]
[1:06:52] brother random said the true filter will
[1:06:55] set all those things out
[1:06:57] and bring nothing but the trueness of
[1:06:59] God the word into the real true soul
[1:07:04] amen
[1:07:05] so now he goes on to say I hope I'm born
[1:07:09] you I'm enjoying myself
[1:07:12] people can live in this spirit and they
[1:07:14] dance in the spirit
[1:07:16] they shout in the spirit they go to
[1:07:18] church in the spirit and they can
[1:07:19] absolutely have the real spirit of God
[1:07:22] anointed on that Spirit but still be
[1:07:24] lost just as devil possessed as they can
[1:07:28] be with that spirit
[1:07:31] because watch that's the reason you
[1:07:34] couldn't tell that woman she was wearing
[1:07:36] shorts and was wrong you couldn't tell
[1:07:39] her bobbing her hair was wrong you can't

[1:08:16] I gotta quit and but I gotta read this
[1:08:18] verse Adam said looky here
[1:08:20] here's a little lady twisting herself
[1:08:22] down the street here's a young fella his
[1:08:25] eyes catch it
[1:08:27] he's a member of the church he's a
[1:08:28] Pentecostal he's whatever he is
[1:08:31] but the first thing you know there's no
[1:08:33] hope Post in there
[1:08:37] she'll say
[1:08:38] hello
[1:08:40] and he's got curly hair
[1:08:42] kind of nice looking straight and
[1:08:44] shouldered young man
[1:08:46] maybe tried to live right
[1:08:49] and she start walking up to him
[1:08:51] and he's even a preacher
[1:08:54] the first thing you know
[1:08:56] now what is it this out here the flesh
[1:08:59] desire
[1:09:01] but the spirit down here yet anointed
[1:09:03] saying don't do it don't do it
[1:09:07] but what will it do
[1:09:10] it'll move right around there hold
[1:09:15] there it goes the first thing you know
[1:09:17] he's trying to make a date with her he's
[1:09:19] guilty of committing adultery whether he
[1:09:22] touches her or not
[1:09:25] now listen now he's anointed where
[1:09:28] his spirit
[1:09:31] but a genuine born-again Son of God Amen
[1:09:34] you can't do it yourself now
[1:09:36] he said it's totally impossible for a
[1:09:39] red-blooded male to walk before a female
[1:09:41] like that without something taking place
[1:09:45] but when there is something on the
[1:09:48] inside not the spirit but the inside of
[1:09:51] the inside
[1:09:53] that little born against something here
[1:09:57] see the soul
[1:09:59] he said see though that man might have
[1:10:01] shouted spoke in tongues jump dance and
[1:10:04] everything else Anointed with the spirit
[1:10:05] done all the signs and wonders that God
[1:10:07] said in there by his Spirit Jesus said
[1:10:10] many will come to me in that day and say
[1:10:12] Lord have I not prophesied in your name
[1:10:13] cast out devils in your name have not
[1:10:16] this and he said depart for me ye that
[1:10:18] work iniquity what is Iniquity something
[1:10:20] that you know to do and don't do it
[1:10:23] depart for me ye that worked iniquity I
[1:10:25] didn't even know you
[1:10:27] but down on the inside of that man if
[1:10:31] that little Thai post is in there that
[1:10:35] seed of God that was predestinated
[1:10:37] before the foundation of the world I
[1:10:39] don't care what takes place it holds him
[1:10:44] it's there to stay
[1:10:48] can you say Amen
[1:10:50] oh do you love him
[1:10:54] if the musicians will come I gotta close
[1:11:00] so uh a person can be Anointed with the
[1:11:04] same spirit that a True Believer is
[1:11:06] Anointed with
[1:11:08] but listen
[1:11:09] brother Brown says but down on the
[1:11:12] inside of that next rim
[1:11:15] say Body Spirit down into the next realm
[1:11:18] the soul the third Rim is the soul and
[1:11:22] that's predestinated by God
[1:11:26] there is where the real sea germ Lays
[1:11:30] is in there
[1:11:33] can you say man
[1:11:35] now listen and remember if I take a
[1:11:38] of Burr and cut it open draft it draft
[1:11:41] into it the heart of a wheat and put it
[1:11:43] in there bury it it would bring forth
[1:11:45] the wheat out of the Cocker burn
[1:11:47] no matter what the outside is what the
[1:11:51] emotions see
[1:11:53] how he's getting down to it your body
[1:11:55] could be corrupt your body could be old
[1:11:56] your body could be still full of you
[1:11:59] know as as as see it's it's still
[1:12:01] subject to things
[1:12:04] but if that Soul down inside of you was
[1:12:07] changed
[1:12:09] no matter what this body is doing
[1:12:13] it's producing a son of God
[1:12:17] hello
[1:12:18] see the spirit can be anointed and never
[1:12:20] produce the Son of God it can produce
[1:12:22] emotions
[1:12:23] [Music]
[1:12:25] ain't that right so he says today so
[1:12:28] many confused about the evidence of the
[1:12:30] Holy Ghost and so forth Satan can
[1:12:31] impersonate any kind of a gift that
[1:12:33] God's got but it cannot bring that word
[1:12:35] word by word
[1:12:38] there's where he felt in the Garden of
[1:12:40] Eden that's where he always failed
[1:12:42] that's where them see on the tape false
[1:12:45] anointed ones anointed ones they can be
[1:12:47] Anointed with the spirit speak in
[1:12:49] tongues Dan shout preach the gospel and
[1:12:51] steal a devil
[1:12:52] it's the inside everybody say it's the
[1:12:55] inside
[1:12:56] can you say Amen
[1:12:58] now I I know I wish this is long and
[1:13:01] I've got a lot but that's okay I hope I
[1:13:03] made a little bit of sense to you today
[1:13:06] but I I will say this
[1:13:08] God restores the soul
[1:13:13] why
[1:13:14] to make a word bride
[1:13:18] it's not after a church he's after a
[1:13:20] bride
[1:13:22] he's not after what Pentecost thought
[1:13:25] was it and that's the restoration of
[1:13:27] gifts speaking in tongues and shouting
[1:13:29] and running all over the place and
[1:13:31] rolling on the floor and then still
[1:13:32] living like a devil outside
[1:13:34] I didn't make bright
[1:13:36] [Music]
[1:13:38] didn't bring maturity
[1:13:41] brought the restoration of the Soul
[1:13:48] that keeps that bride intact
[1:13:51] that's why there's going to be real
[1:13:53] young people in this age middle age
[1:13:56] whatever and and the devil's going to do
[1:13:58] everything he can to sway you
[1:14:02] but God has got to your soul
[1:14:05] and has restored your soul
[1:14:09] oh do you love him
[1:14:10] isn't he wonderful
