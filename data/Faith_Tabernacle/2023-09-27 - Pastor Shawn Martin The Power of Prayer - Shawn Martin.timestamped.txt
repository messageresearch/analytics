[42:28] amen and amen
[42:30] praise the Lord
[42:32] uh James the fifth chapter

[42:43] is any sick among you let him call for

[42:48] pray over him anointing him with oil in
[42:51] the name of the Lord
[42:53] and the prayer of faith everybody say
[42:55] the prayer of faith
[42:57] shall save the sick and the Lord shall
[43:00] raise him up and if he have committed
[43:02] sins they shall be
[43:05] forgiven him amen you can
[43:09] have your seats this evening and
[43:12] um
[43:13] I'm just going to I guess use the title
[43:18] uh the prayer of faith
[43:21] uh been speaking on prayer
[43:24] past a couple Wednesday nights and why
[43:28] we should pray but
[43:31] um
[43:33] just thinking of on the prayer of faith
[43:36] and I understand that the scripture that
[43:39] we've read is talking of laying on hands
[43:42] hands on the sick
[43:44] but my my main focus is the the prayer
[43:49] of faith
[43:50] uh I I believe it is important that we
[43:54] as Believers pray
[43:56] it is it is something and and I think
[43:58] maybe all of us are battled in that area
[44:02] where Satan tries to keep us from
[44:04] praying
[44:05] so much easier to do the other things to
[44:08] voice our thoughts divorce our opinions
[44:10] to avoids try to change things uh in our
[44:14] own selves and it's so hard to pray
[44:18] but we should pray in times of testing
[44:20] and trials we we should pray when things
[44:23] go wrong
[44:25] we should pray when it seems as though
[44:28] God has forsaken us
[44:30] we should pray when it our back is
[44:32] against the wall not only in the good
[44:35] times should we pray but when all hell
[44:38] is against us
[44:40] we we should pray
[44:42] because God moves on the scene when we
[44:44] pray as the prophet taught us prayer
[44:47] changes things it's the greatest weapon
[44:50] that is known to man given into our
[44:52] hands and and and
[44:55] we know that for for whatever question
[44:59] or whatever need that we have Christ is
[45:02] the answer and the prophet said Faith
[45:05] brings Christ to us Faith does a man and
[45:10] therefore we must have faith when we
[45:13] pray
[45:14] and so the the the the prayer of faith
[45:17] isn't just uh when we lay hands on the
[45:20] sick but uh that that should be the the
[45:23] prayer that anyone would pray every
[45:26] believer prays anytime you pray is the
[45:29] prayer of faith but we are to live by
[45:32] faith we are to walk by faith we are to
[45:34] speak by faith we are to Pray by faith
[45:38] everything it is is by faith brother
[45:41] Brandon would tell us Faith knows no
[45:43] defeat faith is perfect Faith brings
[45:47] things when there is no things to be
[45:50] brought for Faith creates uh Faith takes
[45:54] doubt away takes negative away and makes
[45:57] positive
[45:59] in another place he says and this was to
[46:02] me profound but he says we lose our
[46:04] Glory if we lose faith
[46:08] we lose our Glory if we lose Faith you
[46:12] see God has called us for his name and
[46:16] when we become powerless and defeated
[46:20] then we lose our identity as to what his
[46:25] purpose was for calling us a man he
[46:29] called us for a reason he called us for
[46:31] a purpose and when when we become
[46:34] defeated when we become weak and when we
[46:37] become powerless then we're we totally
[46:41] lose the identity amen because we want
[46:45] to identify with his purpose and our
[46:47] lives we want to identify with why he
[46:50] called us we we want to identify with
[46:53] with his mind and and these things and
[46:57] God has not called us to be weak God did
[46:59] not call us to be powerless God did not
[47:02] call us to be estranged from his his
[47:05] everything that belongs to us and all
[47:08] that he years and so when we look at
[47:11] Faith Abraham showed that he had Faith
[47:14] by calling those things that were not as
[47:17] though they were and and that was the
[47:19] sign of Faith a man and and that was
[47:23] actually the works of Abraham he called
[47:25] those things that were not as though
[47:28] they already were they did not exist but
[47:32] he acted and talked as though they
[47:34] existed he hadn't as of yet received the
[47:38] promise and yet he talked and acted as
[47:41] though he had already
[47:43] received the promise and he never
[47:46] wavered ain't that right that that was
[47:49] his faith he never wavered and and so
[47:52] his faith brought every promise that God
[47:56] had made to him into existence amen
[48:01] because that is the power of Faith a man
[48:04] uh power and authority is manifested
[48:08] winter ever faith is because that that's
[48:12] what faith is and brother Branham said
[48:15] all this power of God that we're talking
[48:18] about is accessible To Us by faith amen
[48:22] there's not one element of God that you
[48:25] cannot have uh if you have faith a man
[48:28] all the powers of God Amen is at our
[48:33] disposal by faith amen uh brother
[48:37] Branham says in another place Faith
[48:39] leads you to the power amen says so
[48:43] we're not to be victims we're not to be
[48:45] powerless we're not to be defeated we're
[48:47] not to be Beggars we are to have faith
[48:51] and Faith puts us in contact with the
[48:55] power of God a man thinking of the woman
[48:58] with the issue of blood you know by her
[49:01] having brother Branham said a a her
[49:04] having a personal faith in Jesus being
[49:06] the Son of God Paul hold the power of
[49:09] God through him to her amen now you
[49:12] think of that he had all the power
[49:15] invested in him for he said all power in
[49:17] Heaven and Earth is given unto me but
[49:19] she knew how to pull that power through
[49:22] him to her and that was by her faith she
[49:26] may she may have not been recognized
[49:28] among the the names of men she may have
[49:31] not had a great uh uh uh whatever uh uh
[49:35] uh uh in among the society but she had
[49:40] Faith to pull the power of God through
[49:43] him to her and so is it today ain't that
[49:47] right a man sees so brother Branham
[49:50] would actually say in this great room
[49:52] here where the power of God has bottled
[49:54] down Satan can no more stand where faith
[49:59] is than a person could exist where tear
[50:02] gas is falling it'll have to go out and
[50:06] you say Amen you see Satan cannot no
[50:09] more stand when a person is there with
[50:12] faith a man a man says so uh that means
[50:17] them that that your prayer if it's a
[50:19] prayer of faith then your prayer has
[50:22] more power than the Angels it has more
[50:26] power than the laws of the land it has
[50:28] more Powers than the devil could ever
[50:31] ever ever even think to obtain is when
[50:35] you begin to pray the prayer of faith
[50:39] now First Peter 1 and 3 blessed be the
[50:42] God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ
[50:45] which according to His abundant Mercy
[50:48] hath begotten us again unto a lively
[50:50] Hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ
[50:53] from the dead to an inheritance
[50:56] Incorruptible and undefiled that fate is
[51:00] not away reserved in heaven for you who
[51:04] are kept by the power of God through
[51:07] faith unto salvation Nation a man ready
[51:10] to be revealed in the last time amen so
[51:14] so not only is the inheritance kept by
[51:17] the power of God but I believe that
[51:19] every one of us the the elect of God are
[51:22] kept by the power of God through faith a
[51:27] man unto salvation ain't that right
[51:29] faith is talked about a lot but faith is
[51:32] so essential to our lives amen not just
[51:36] to get uh ask God to save you but it's
[51:39] so essential is is the main part of us
[51:42] going in a Rapture is coming to a
[51:45] perfect Faith a man so if brother Brown
[51:48] said if the church would put more faith
[51:51] to work you would see more things taking
[51:53] place in the church see it's it's not
[51:56] God that needing to do something it's
[51:59] God waiting for us to exercise the faith
[52:03] ain't that right it's an exercise the
[52:05] faith amen there there is no other
[52:08] prayer can you say that with me there is
[52:10] no other prayer more effective than than
[52:14] the prayer of faith amen you can whine
[52:17] about your prayer you can pray and whine
[52:19] you you can pray and beg you can pray
[52:22] and want your your prayer could be full
[52:24] of wishing and that do you no good if
[52:28] it's not the prayer of faith amen it has
[52:31] to be the prayer of faith amen because
[52:33] it's that prayer that has the authority
[52:37] and the power amen behind it the prayer
[52:41] of faith Works amen John 15 7 says if
[52:45] you abide in me and my words abide in
[52:47] you you shall ask what you will and it
[52:51] shall be done unto you look at the
[52:53] prayer amen when when when the word is
[52:57] abiding in you and you are abiding in
[53:00] Christ amen watch the prayer go to work
[53:03] then whatever you shall ask it shall be
[53:07] given unto you Mark 11 24 therefore I
[53:10] say unto you what so what things so ever
[53:13] you desire When you pray believe that
[53:16] you receive them and you shall have them
[53:19] do you believe that is that not a
[53:21] promise a man believe that you receive
[53:24] them and you shall have them see so that
[53:27] is a Divine promise of God Amen we
[53:30] should never go around woe is me woe is
[53:32] me if you just only knew if if you know
[53:35] and looking for sympathy and looking for
[53:38] someone just to Pat us on the back and
[53:40] and I'm not sending words of
[53:42] encouragement are great and and it it
[53:44] does help it itifies and and we should
[53:47] edify one another in all of these things
[53:49] but you're not weak if you have faith in
[53:54] your prayer ain't that right to pray the
[53:58] prayer of faith now now notice what
[54:01] brother Branham says we are bringing our
[54:04] faith to test it against the power of
[54:08] the devil right
[54:11] isn't that amazing don't don't dare to
[54:14] test anything against the power of the
[54:16] devil but if you'll take Faith amen
[54:19] don't take your abilities don't take
[54:20] your mind don't take your intellect
[54:22] don't take your talents don't take
[54:24] nothing but it will bring our faith Amen
[54:28] to to test it against the power of the
[54:31] devil every time you pray the prayer of
[54:33] faith you're bringing it to a test
[54:35] against the power of the enemy amen no
[54:38] matter how dark it is put your faith to
[54:40] the test against the power of the devil
[54:44] ain't that right now Hebrews 11 and 6
[54:47] but without faith it is impossible to
[54:50] please him for he that cometh or God
[54:53] must believe that he is and that he is a
[54:55] rewarder of them that diligently seek
[54:58] him now we talked about this before but
[55:01] now think of it he that comes to God
[55:03] must believe that he is ain't that right
[55:07] not just believing that he exists but
[55:11] believing that he is believe that he is
[55:14] everything that he says he is a man
[55:18] believed that he is able to do exceeding
[55:21] abundantly above all that we ask or
[55:24] think according to the power that
[55:26] worketh in us not worketh in heaven not
[55:29] worketh in angels not work as a man in
[55:31] in himself amen but the power that now
[55:35] works in you and I can you say amen amen
[55:40] is God able to do it amen do you know
[55:42] what power that you have in you amen you
[55:45] have the power of deity living in you
[55:47] amen uh if you've got the Holy Ghost you
[55:50] do a man deity is not in heaven deity is
[55:53] in you ain't that right so according to
[55:55] the power that worketh in us he is able
[55:59] to do it far exceedingly abundantly that
[56:01] you could ever ask or even think
[56:04] amen say so faith is the power that
[56:08] worketh in US Amen brother Branham said
[56:11] faith is the purchasing power amen
[56:14] another place he said you have to have a
[56:16] willing heart and God sends his faith
[56:18] down sends his power for faith is power
[56:23] can you say amen amen you you say well I
[56:26] just want more power no you need more
[56:28] faith a man for faith is the power faith
[56:32] is the access Amen to anything of God
[56:35] Amen you've got all the promises right
[56:37] here all you need to do is have the
[56:40] faith can you say amen amen so don't
[56:42] make your prayer a beg a prayer a
[56:44] begging don't make your a prayer a big a
[56:48] a prayer of a uh of a uh Vagabond amen
[56:53] you're a child of the king a man with a
[56:56] faith a man for whatever you ask so
[57:00] you've got to come to him believing that
[57:03] he is your God you must not not come to
[57:05] him wondering if he is but you you see
[57:08] we must believe what the Bible says he
[57:11] is ain't that right everything you you
[57:13] say well I've got if I've got to come to
[57:16] him believing that he is and how do I
[57:18] know what he is well the Bible tells you
[57:20] what he is he is Jehovah Jireh he is the
[57:23] Shalom he is your peace he is your
[57:25] provider he is everything that you have
[57:28] now he's the wheel in the middle of the
[57:30] wheel ain't that right amen he's
[57:32] everything he's the Fourth Man In The
[57:34] Fire he's the one he's the one that
[57:36] would show up in the Daniel and the
[57:38] Lion's Den ain't that right amen he's
[57:41] the one he's the one in the burning bush
[57:43] and and and so we must come to him
[57:46] believing he is what we have already
[57:51] experienced him to beat now I want to
[57:53] ask you how many has ever experienced
[57:55] him to be a Healer
[57:56] have you experienced him to be a savior
[57:59] have you experienced him to be a way man
[58:00] well most of you have amen I believe
[58:03] just a show of hands God looks at them
[58:05] things amen amen and if God has ever
[58:08] done anything for you amen we ought to
[58:10] just lift up our hand and say yes I'm
[58:12] one of them I've experienced God I I
[58:15] know what it is see so then you come to
[58:18] God not only what the Bible says but
[58:21] what you have experienced him to be in
[58:24] your life amen don't you let the devil
[58:26] don't you let your trial take your
[58:28] experiences away to where you come to
[58:31] the your prayer amen and you don't even
[58:33] know how to thank God for what he's done
[58:36] for you in the past amen we get so
[58:38] gloomy and we get so uh in the dumb so
[58:41] we get so looking at the present that we
[58:44] forget that God done something for us in
[58:46] the back in the years past yesterday
[58:49] even and if he'd done something for us
[58:51] yesterday why can't he do it today
[58:54] so we may come to him believing that he
[58:57] is
[58:59] didn't you say man
[59:02] in order to believe that he is
[59:05] we must become acquainted with him
[59:08] I think we must become acquainted in the
[59:10] best way for a man to get acquainted
[59:11] with God Is by a new birth
[59:14] for the Jean seed of God is then
[59:16] quickened In You by a new birth
[59:20] and then what happens you become a part
[59:22] of God the life of God is now in you
[59:26] ain't that right then what did the
[59:28] prophet say then you can believe for the
[59:29] impossible amen that's right you can
[59:32] believe in the Supernatural brother Bram
[59:34] said receiving the baptism of the Holy
[59:36] Ghost makes you Abraham's seed and gives
[59:39] you the same faith
[59:41] the same faith that Abraham had that
[59:44] calls those things that are not as
[59:46] though they were no matter how you look
[59:48] what you feel like it's what God said
[59:51] about it so that's the faith that's the
[59:54] prayer faith is an Abraham faith ain't
[59:57] that right yes sir
[1:00:01] knowing that it's already going to be
[1:00:03] done before you even pray
[1:00:05] ain't that right why because you're
[1:00:07] coming to him and believing that he is
[1:00:11] not limiting God he's unlimited he's
[1:00:14] Supreme
[1:00:16] ain't that right he's omnipotent
[1:00:19] he's undefeated
[1:00:21] ain't that right so so to to to get
[1:00:24] acquainted with him in in such a way is
[1:00:27] is receiving the baptism of the Holy
[1:00:30] Ghost and and then see it you're not
[1:00:33] learning about God then in a a in a
[1:00:37] history lesson but you are experiencing
[1:00:40] the realities of God by partaking with
[1:00:43] him partaking of him
[1:00:50] second Peter 1 4 says whereby are given
[1:00:53] unto us great exceeding great and
[1:00:56] precious promises that by these you
[1:00:58] might be partakers of the divine nature
[1:01:00] having escaped the corruption that is in
[1:01:03] the world through last
[1:01:04] and man I I trust that we've all escaped
[1:01:07] the world the corruption
[1:01:10] I always escape the corruption
[1:01:12] you've escaped the corruption so then
[1:01:14] you already know something about what he
[1:01:17] is
[1:01:18] he is faithful to his word he is
[1:01:21] faithful Amen to answer prayers has he
[1:01:24] not answered your prayers before amen so
[1:01:27] then you have this concept of really
[1:01:29] what he is because you've experienced
[1:01:31] him I was in the gutter but I'm not now
[1:01:33] what happened God came on the scene and
[1:01:36] delivered me I know enough of that to
[1:01:39] know that he is
[1:01:41] ain't that Ryan brother Brown said if
[1:01:43] you really come to God and got a taste
[1:01:45] of the Heavenly gifts so God partaker of
[1:01:48] his divine nature while you could no
[1:01:50] more become a sinner again what an
[1:01:52] experience with God to where that you
[1:01:55] could never One Touch One Touch is an
[1:01:58] eternal touch and that you could never
[1:02:00] be a sinner again now you have come up
[1:02:04] into a place to write you really know
[1:02:06] who he is
[1:02:08] amen that's true see so you could never
[1:02:12] become a sinner again an unbeliever then
[1:02:15] a stalk of corn could become a cocklebur
[1:02:17] see why you have escaped the corruption
[1:02:20] in this world uh that is in the world
[1:02:22] through lust brother Brown said see
[1:02:25] you've escaped it see who that's to it's
[1:02:27] to the church them who are in Christ has
[1:02:31] been exalted above these things not he
[1:02:34] exalted himself but Christ has brought
[1:02:37] him up you you've you come into an
[1:02:40] experience with him
[1:02:45] remember the colored sister that
[1:02:46] testified and
[1:02:48] she said I ain't what I ought to be
[1:02:50] ain't what I want to be but one thing
[1:02:53] sure I ain't what I used to be
[1:02:55] brother Brown said she had come up from
[1:02:56] somewhere she had been brought up and he
[1:02:59] said that's how we know we've passed
[1:03:00] from Death unto life we look back to the
[1:03:03] pit where we was hewed from and we're
[1:03:04] not what we want to be we're not even
[1:03:07] what we ought to be but one thing we're
[1:03:09] thankful for we're not what we used to
[1:03:11] be we're on the road ain't that right
[1:03:13] seats so that we're coming to God
[1:03:16] believing that he is the word says that
[1:03:20] and my experience it has matched it
[1:03:24] amen praise God then the second thing we
[1:03:27] come to God we must believe that he is a
[1:03:29] rewarder
[1:03:30] everybody say he's a rewarder
[1:03:33] he's a rewarder when you when you come
[1:03:35] to God this is how you approach him in
[1:03:37] prayer he is a rewarder amen talking
[1:03:41] about a prayer of faith believing that
[1:03:43] God is and believing that he is a
[1:03:45] rewarder of those who diligently seek
[1:03:47] him so when I come on my knees and get
[1:03:49] on my knees and begin to utter words I
[1:03:51] know my prayer is not in vain for he
[1:03:53] hears my prayer and he is a rewarder of
[1:03:57] them that diligently seek him can you
[1:03:59] say man you see Church you cannot come
[1:04:02] to him any other way
[1:04:04] I cannot come to him in in in any other
[1:04:07] way I pray knowing that he is going to
[1:04:09] answer my petition and I'll say to you
[1:04:12] today he is a rewarder of those your
[1:04:15] prayer is not in vain
[1:04:18] God answers prayers do you believe that
[1:04:20] now I have to tell you God doesn't
[1:04:22] always answer quickly
[1:04:24] that God does answer prayers some of you
[1:04:27] might have been praying for years but
[1:04:28] don't you quit your praying God answers
[1:04:31] prayer
[1:04:33] yes sir Amen brother Brown said
[1:04:36] sometimes he makes us wait for the
[1:04:38] answer but that doesn't change who and
[1:04:40] what he is ain't that right amen see and
[1:04:44] so he says and just because everything's
[1:04:46] going wrong that's no sign that we
[1:04:48] should quit praying just pray on any how
[1:04:52] why because you're coming to him knowing
[1:04:55] that he is a rewarder of those who
[1:04:59] diligently seek Him don't give up
[1:05:01] praying for your loved ones don't give
[1:05:03] up praying for your health don't give up
[1:05:05] praying for the church don't give up
[1:05:07] praying for whatever you're having to
[1:05:09] eat of God is a rewarder if you don't
[1:05:12] believe that then you shouldn't pray at
[1:05:14] all that if you can really believe that
[1:05:16] he is a rewarder get down on your knees
[1:05:18] and start uttering them words of Faith
[1:05:21] because you know it's going to bring
[1:05:22] Christ to you
[1:05:26] why do I lay hands on the sick because I
[1:05:29] believe God answers prayer
[1:05:31] why do I kneel and pray because I
[1:05:33] believe that God answers prayer can you
[1:05:36] say Amen brother Brown said see I have
[1:05:38] no special prayer I just believe that
[1:05:40] God is and that he rewards those who
[1:05:43] seek after him amen see no special power
[1:05:46] amen no special words that we can utter
[1:05:49] amen we just got a Heart full of faith
[1:05:52] knowing that he is
[1:05:54] and that he rewards those who seek after
[1:05:58] him
[1:05:59] ain't that Brian
[1:06:00] so he answers in his time the way it's
[1:06:04] best makes it work just right for us
[1:06:06] ain't that right now there's only one
[1:06:09] thing that keeps God from hearing our
[1:06:11] prayer and that's when sin is in a man's
[1:06:13] life
[1:06:14] ain't that right because if our heart
[1:06:16] condemn us then God will not hear us
[1:06:18] ain't that right amen see but when the
[1:06:21] prophet said when there is no sin in
[1:06:22] your life then you know where you're
[1:06:25] standing with God
[1:06:27] and I think every day it behooves us to
[1:06:30] know where we're standing with God
[1:06:31] can you say amen and the only way that
[1:06:34] can take that and cause that doubt is
[1:06:36] When sin is there and we don't know
[1:06:38] where we're standing with him we don't
[1:06:40] know amen now a lot of times you don't
[1:06:42] have to feel him to know where you stand
[1:06:44] with God Amen but when you know that the
[1:06:46] blood has been applied you know that you
[1:06:49] have done everything that God has
[1:06:50] required and I'm standing here by faith
[1:06:53] amen look at job now amen job didn't
[1:06:55] have amen see a lot of things and
[1:06:57] glittery but he knew this he had already
[1:07:00] applied the blood amen his prayer had
[1:07:03] been be called by the blood of Jesus
[1:07:05] Christ and he knew where he stood with
[1:07:08] God
[1:07:09] he knew can you say amen he knew see so
[1:07:12] when there's no sin in your life the
[1:07:14] prophet said then you know where you're
[1:07:15] standing with God why there's no
[1:07:18] condemnation
[1:07:20] there's no condemnation
[1:07:23] ain't that right what then faith can
[1:07:25] come if there's condemnation you can't
[1:07:27] have faith try it you can't ain't that
[1:07:31] right when their sin is there when
[1:07:32] there's something that is there amen and
[1:07:34] we made right and we're hiding or
[1:07:36] whatever you cannot have that correct
[1:07:39] Faith you can Bluff yourself and Satan
[1:07:41] cannot be bluffed he knows whether
[1:07:43] you've got the goods or not ain't that
[1:07:45] right amen that when there's no
[1:07:47] condemnation then he says only then can
[1:07:50] you come to God believing that he is and
[1:07:53] that he is a rewarder because there's
[1:07:55] nothing there condemning your prayer
[1:07:59] amen the prayer of faith
[1:08:02] brother Brown said see if our heart
[1:08:04] doesn't condemn us then we have this
[1:08:06] assurance that God answers prayer
[1:08:09] ain't that right
[1:08:11] so notice the prayer of faith must be
[1:08:14] prayed
[1:08:15] Romans 10 and 17 it says so then Faith
[1:08:20] cometh by hearing and hearing by the
[1:08:23] word of God now I'm going to get
[1:08:24] somewhere and it'll be simple I'm sure
[1:08:26] but but and you probably already know
[1:08:28] all these things but we're going to
[1:08:29] bring it to uh your remembrance
[1:08:32] amen Faith cometh by hearing we're
[1:08:35] talking about the the prayer of faith
[1:08:37] that's the only prayer that's going to
[1:08:38] work it's the prayer of faith amen see
[1:08:41] so then Faith cometh by hearing and
[1:08:44] hearing by the word of God and now the
[1:08:46] prophet tells us to hear means to
[1:08:49] understand
[1:08:51] Amen to hear means to understand so
[1:08:54] we'll we'll set this way Faith cometh by
[1:08:57] understanding and understanding by the
[1:08:59] word
[1:09:00] amen that's right see amen now so many
[1:09:04] lives are powerless because people are
[1:09:06] simple when it comes to the power of God
[1:09:09] they don't understand it their prayers
[1:09:11] are powerless amen their Christian Life
[1:09:14] is powerless amen because they have no
[1:09:17] understanding of of the power of God
[1:09:20] Amen see so brother Graham talk of spoke
[1:09:23] of the school of prophets in in Elijah's
[1:09:26] day saying that there was a lot of
[1:09:27] carnal impersonations how that the
[1:09:30] school of the prophets were up there
[1:09:31] training to be prophets and how simple
[1:09:34] everybody say how simple they were how
[1:09:37] simple they were till they even they
[1:09:39] couldn't understand the power of God
[1:09:42] Amen see so when you to pray the prayer
[1:09:45] of faith our understanding has got to be
[1:09:47] enlightened to understand that I'm not
[1:09:49] praying to a goddess Stone I'm not
[1:09:51] praying to a god of wood I'm not praying
[1:09:54] to a god at the same way that a that a
[1:09:57] Hindu would pray to their God and
[1:10:00] Muhammad would pray to their God that
[1:10:02] this one would pray to their God I'm
[1:10:04] praying to a god that I have an
[1:10:06] understanding of he is all-powerful he
[1:10:09] is all Supreme we have this
[1:10:11] understanding of that the power of God
[1:10:14] now he says they thought the power had
[1:10:16] lifted Elijah up and thrown him out on
[1:10:19] the mountain somewhere they had sent a
[1:10:21] search party to hunt for him when Elisha
[1:10:24] knew good and well that God had taken
[1:10:26] him to glory amen see that they didn't
[1:10:29] have the understanding of the power of
[1:10:31] God but Elisha had those understanding
[1:10:34] he understood that it was the power of
[1:10:37] God that lifted him a translated Elijah
[1:10:41] amen see God had taken him and he
[1:10:45] escaped death by going home to God on a
[1:10:48] chariot of fire and Horses of fire can
[1:10:50] you say Amen
[1:10:52] so people don't understand the power of
[1:10:54] God today they don't understand that the
[1:10:57] power of God is here Amen to change
[1:10:59] lives they don't understand that it's
[1:11:01] the power of God that fixes marriages
[1:11:03] they don't understand that it's the
[1:11:05] power of God that sets the captive free
[1:11:07] they don't understand that it's the
[1:11:09] power of God that breaks the Fetters off
[1:11:12] of people's lives it doesn't matter how
[1:11:14] drunk a person is it doesn't matter how
[1:11:16] addicted a person is to drugs it doesn't
[1:11:18] matter how how much and shamble a
[1:11:21] person's life is it's the power of God
[1:11:23] that can break it if the power of God
[1:11:25] changed you that same power will change
[1:11:28] somebody else amen but the people are
[1:11:31] powerless in their religion in their
[1:11:33] prayer is because they have no
[1:11:35] understanding of the power of God that
[1:11:38] they pray to
[1:11:40] they don't understand that it's the
[1:11:42] power of God that is going to pick us up
[1:11:44] and catch us away
[1:11:46] but brother Brown said Elijah was
[1:11:48] elected to it Elisha was elected to it
[1:11:51] amen you understand what I'm saying the
[1:11:54] others were trying to tap into it
[1:11:56] through their schooling and their
[1:11:57] conferences and their seminars and and
[1:12:00] their training and all of that I don't
[1:12:02] care how much trains you are you've got
[1:12:04] to come to an understanding of the power
[1:12:07] of God it's the power of God that's
[1:12:09] going to change your life it's the power
[1:12:11] of God that's going to change your body
[1:12:13] it's the power of God can you say amen
[1:12:16] and if you notice Elijah didn't have to
[1:12:18] be schooled
[1:12:20] Elisha didn't have to be schooled can
[1:12:23] you say man their faith didn't need to
[1:12:24] rest there or their faith did not rest
[1:12:27] in some 10-step program Amen on how to
[1:12:31] be better and how to be closer with God
[1:12:33] and how to walk with God and how to be a
[1:12:35] better this and a better that and a
[1:12:37] better this they didn't read all these
[1:12:39] books and all of these things that are
[1:12:41] out there today they are Faith rested in
[1:12:44] the understanding of the power of
[1:12:46] almighty God can you say amen and I'll
[1:12:50] tell you I don't care how weak of a
[1:12:51] Christian you are I don't care how
[1:12:53] impossible you are I don't care how
[1:12:55] hopeless your situation is if you can
[1:12:58] have the understanding of what the power
[1:13:00] of God is to you amen then you can come
[1:13:03] and pray the prayer of faith amen and
[1:13:06] that faith will tap you in to the power
[1:13:10] of God
[1:13:16] brother random says I want you to listen
[1:13:18] and give the time in
[1:13:20] and be just as reverent as possible
[1:13:23] especially while we're speaking because
[1:13:25] if you don't get the words that we have
[1:13:27] to place in each night then you come to
[1:13:29] the platform not knowing what you're
[1:13:31] coming for
[1:13:32] you understand that God does not want us
[1:13:35] we're upset this way we're past we're
[1:13:38] past the stage of not coming to God
[1:13:41] and not knowing what we're coming for
[1:13:45] you must understand everybody say I must
[1:13:47] understand
[1:13:48] brother Brown said see you must
[1:13:50] understand you must come with an
[1:13:52] understanding and that's the way Christ
[1:13:55] wants us to come you have to have faith
[1:13:57] in what you're doing if you don't you
[1:13:59] just going to kind of come in half
[1:14:02] Hazard well I hope so it'll never happen
[1:14:05] I can't happen see amen see well you
[1:14:08] can't have faith if you're going to come
[1:14:09] like that you must thoroughly everybody
[1:14:11] say You must thoroughly you must
[1:14:14] thoroughly know beyond the shadow of a
[1:14:16] doubt you must thoroughly know what
[1:14:18] you're going or doing and know it's
[1:14:21] going to happen
[1:14:23] amen
[1:14:25] hello
[1:14:27] we do not pray because it's just our
[1:14:29] duty
[1:14:31] we do not pray because it's just a
[1:14:33] ritual
[1:14:36] no not the bride not the elect
[1:14:39] we've entered to an understanding
[1:14:41] because we have relationship with him
[1:14:44] amen
[1:14:45] amen you know what you're doing you know
[1:14:48] it's going to happen then you're
[1:14:50] positive then then that it's going to
[1:14:53] happen
[1:14:54] now Faith
[1:14:57] we'll move on here there are two kinds
[1:15:00] of faith
[1:15:01] which means there's two kinds of
[1:15:03] understanding
[1:15:05] if Faith cometh by hearing understanding
[1:15:09] and understanding comes by the word
[1:15:11] there's two kinds of Faith the prophet
[1:15:13] told us two types whatever you say that
[1:15:16] one type is the intellectual faith
[1:15:20] in other words intellectual
[1:15:21] understanding
[1:15:23] and the other is heart faith
[1:15:26] which is an understanding that comes by
[1:15:28] revelation
[1:15:30] that comes not to the mind but to the
[1:15:32] heart
[1:15:34] and and Romans 10 10 it says for with
[1:15:38] the heart everybody say with the heart
[1:15:40] man believeth under righteousness it
[1:15:43] never said with the Mind man believeth
[1:15:46] under righteousness so then that type of
[1:15:49] Faith the intellectual faith gets you
[1:15:51] nowhere with God
[1:15:53] but but God would write it down that
[1:15:55] from the heart man believeth unto
[1:15:58] righteousness
[1:16:00] so so now now the Bible tells us that in
[1:16:04] the in in the last days perilous times
[1:16:07] shall come and brother Branham after
[1:16:09] reading that scripture quoting it he
[1:16:12] says faith will be pretty slow then so
[1:16:15] so now not talking about just Faith but
[1:16:18] but that the certain type of faith faith
[1:16:22] will be slow then which we know he's
[1:16:24] referring to Heart faith
[1:16:26] faith that comes by Revelation faith
[1:16:29] that is dropped down from here down into
[1:16:31] the heart ain't that right so he says
[1:16:34] there are two things that we have to
[1:16:36] watch closely and they are intellectual
[1:16:39] religion and intellectual faith
[1:16:43] can you say amen that's what he says two
[1:16:46] things that we have to watch closely and
[1:16:48] they are intellectual religion and
[1:16:50] intellectual Faith so now Faith cometh
[1:16:53] by hearing so we say it this way heart
[1:16:56] faith and intellectual Faith both come
[1:16:59] by hearing the word of God Amen see now
[1:17:03] you know brother Bram says people come
[1:17:05] to church and they hear the word but
[1:17:07] they go out with an intellectual faith
[1:17:11] amen they hear the word they come to
[1:17:13] church they hear the word but they go
[1:17:15] out with an intellectual faith and he
[1:17:17] says that's the reason you can't believe
[1:17:19] that's the reason you go back out and
[1:17:22] sin the way you do the reason you cannot
[1:17:24] hold up from one Revival to another is
[1:17:27] because it's intellectual faith
[1:17:31] and you say man and it says that most
[1:17:34] everyone has intellectual Faith most of
[1:17:37] uh churchgoers haven't even your Sinners
[1:17:40] of America today especially in America
[1:17:41] it's a religious Nation it's all
[1:17:44] intellectual Faith intellectual religion
[1:17:47] intellectual Faith amen throughout the
[1:17:50] years men have taught the word of God
[1:17:52] mixing it with their own ideas we've had
[1:17:55] Bible schools and seminars we've had
[1:17:58] Bible conferences to learn about the
[1:18:00] Bible and and so on and learn about God
[1:18:03] and what it is it's men taking the Bible
[1:18:05] and teaching it by their own wisdom
[1:18:08] brother Brown says we uh School our
[1:18:11] Seminary students in all kinds of Bible
[1:18:13] theology and things like that man-made
[1:18:16] Theology and got a bunch of church it
[1:18:19] just exactly a laodicea like God said it
[1:18:22] would be and he says oh my when I look
[1:18:25] at that it makes me shiver pregnated
[1:18:28] with intellectual conception
[1:18:32] so there's a phase but it's an by an
[1:18:36] intellectual conception of the word of
[1:18:38] God can you say Amen now that that's the
[1:18:41] problem with this is because the
[1:18:42] intellectual men are getting behind the
[1:18:44] pulpit giving an intellectual speech and
[1:18:47] by doing so they give the people an
[1:18:49] intellectual Faith who have never
[1:18:51] received a birth
[1:18:54] people don't believe they need a birth
[1:18:56] people don't need to believe that they
[1:18:58] need to die out
[1:19:00] can you say Amen because they've got an
[1:19:03] intellectual Faith but yet their faith
[1:19:06] has brought them no power their faith
[1:19:08] has not brought Christ to them can you
[1:19:11] say amen amen he says see when they got
[1:19:13] off in seminaries and got boys and men's
[1:19:16] who men who were brilliant and
[1:19:18] intellectual and taught out the old
[1:19:21] baptism of the Holy Spirit they cut the
[1:19:24] lifeline off
[1:19:26] and you say Amen so see there is no
[1:19:29] other way for the people to get any
[1:19:33] other kind of Faith outside of
[1:19:35] intellectual faith
[1:19:37] when when you've got intellectual men
[1:19:40] teaching by their wisdom and by their
[1:19:42] understanding and oh yeah brother Brown
[1:19:44] so they can make the Bible look and
[1:19:46] paint such a picture but it's all
[1:19:48] intellectual
[1:19:50] right now there's no way the other way
[1:19:52] to get other any other faith
[1:19:55] and you say Amen no wonder people set
[1:19:57] dead in the church
[1:19:59] they sit there without an experience
[1:20:01] with God
[1:20:03] no wonder prayer means nothing to them
[1:20:06] to where they're teaching the people
[1:20:07] it's just a prayer for everybody to say
[1:20:10] one prayer and you've been to churches
[1:20:12] Amen to where they've got a they've got
[1:20:14] a pamphlet that everybody the whole
[1:20:16] congregation reads the prayer off that
[1:20:18] pamphlet that's no good
[1:20:20] [Music]
[1:20:22] it's got to be a prayer of faith
[1:20:26] and you say amen and when it's a prayer
[1:20:29] of faith you can be out in the woods you
[1:20:30] can be out in the desert you can be
[1:20:31] outward nothing else you you can be
[1:20:33] there and you're needing your washing
[1:20:35] machine to work and man you ain't got
[1:20:36] the money to fix it pray the prayer of
[1:20:38] faith and watch that thing go to work
[1:20:41] seen it
[1:20:45] see the prayer of faith
[1:20:47] now brother Branham
[1:20:49] notice what he says now I could preach
[1:20:52] the word he says
[1:20:53] and you could accept it and say that's
[1:20:55] all right yeah I believe that well now
[1:20:58] if that's all the farther it goes
[1:21:01] then you'll never get far with God
[1:21:03] because it's intellectual faith
[1:21:07] hello
[1:21:08] that's the reason people doesn't get
[1:21:10] healed is because they only have an
[1:21:13] intellectual view of it
[1:21:16] what their mind conceives
[1:21:19] now now even we we could say it and
[1:21:22] maybe getting a little Dangerous Ground
[1:21:24] but you we can say it even with message
[1:21:26] folks they hear the quotes over and over
[1:21:29] and over they hear about healing they
[1:21:30] hear about the power of God they hear
[1:21:32] about Rapture they hear about this they
[1:21:33] hear about that I've heard that before
[1:21:35] I've heard that before I've heard that
[1:21:36] for years but if it's not bringing power
[1:21:39] to you
[1:21:42] can you say man these quotes and these
[1:21:45] things that brother Brown taught us is
[1:21:46] not just to make us intellectual
[1:21:49] is to bring power into our lives
[1:21:53] is to bring us up out of laodicea it's
[1:21:56] supposed to bring us up out of
[1:21:57] lukewarmness it's supposed to bring us
[1:21:59] up to where we're walking with God as
[1:22:02] Enoch did
[1:22:03] and you say man
[1:22:05] now now you know the quote that don't
[1:22:08] don't let this quote you know torment
[1:22:10] your mind by telling you that you must
[1:22:13] have intellectual Faith because you
[1:22:14] haven't received your healing yet and
[1:22:16] Satan can work that quote uh a lot on a
[1:22:20] person that's been praying and praying
[1:22:21] and praying and hadn't got the re their
[1:22:23] healing and things like that genuine
[1:22:25] Faith knows that God works according to
[1:22:28] his own time clock and never doubts it
[1:22:33] and you say man we'll go on here and and
[1:22:37] you'll understand because intellectual
[1:22:39] faith will fail everybody say it will
[1:22:41] fail
[1:22:42] it will fail under the tests
[1:22:44] intellectual Faith fails under the test
[1:22:48] brother Brown said the mind will reason
[1:22:50] the mind will say it cannot be I I'm no
[1:22:53] better I my sense of sight says that my
[1:22:56] arm is no straighter than it was
[1:22:57] yesterday well you prayed for it see you
[1:23:00] said oh yeah God is my healer but all of
[1:23:02] a sudden it's not happening
[1:23:04] I I I prayed yesterday I prayed a month
[1:23:07] I I've been praying all this time and
[1:23:09] it's getting worse
[1:23:13] see my sense of feeling says I don't
[1:23:15] feel any better uh any different than I
[1:23:18] did yesterday see reasoning mental
[1:23:20] theology will reason and out you say
[1:23:22] well now wait a minute I believe that's
[1:23:24] foolishness see your reasoning that
[1:23:27] intellectual faith will do that
[1:23:29] amen and you say Amen look at the two
[1:23:33] and a half million people that left
[1:23:34] Egypt
[1:23:37] two and a half million
[1:23:41] you think of it
[1:23:42] they left Egypt they left Egypt for the
[1:23:45] promised land but it proved that they
[1:23:47] all only had intellectual faith
[1:23:51] only two entered into the land of the
[1:23:53] original
[1:23:54] they were the predestinated of God and
[1:23:56] and we've talked about brother Brown's
[1:23:59] talked about it you know and taught us
[1:24:01] that there were two parts of redemption
[1:24:02] coming out and entering into they all
[1:24:05] come out they were all baptized in in
[1:24:07] the Red Sea they all were under the
[1:24:09] pillar of fire they all experienced the
[1:24:11] Miracles they all done that but out when
[1:24:13] it's all said and done only two went
[1:24:15] into the second part of redemption can
[1:24:18] you say man the others took part of the
[1:24:20] first part amen they they were included
[1:24:22] in the first part they come out see but
[1:24:25] they did not go into the completion of
[1:24:27] redemption can you say amen that's right
[1:24:30] you know why they come out of Egypt but
[1:24:32] the prophet said God could not get Egypt
[1:24:34] out of them
[1:24:36] ain't that right God could not get Egypt
[1:24:38] out of them and I'm going to be honest
[1:24:40] with you will you take a man that has
[1:24:42] totally come out of the world totally
[1:24:43] come out of the system of denomination
[1:24:45] watch his prayer and how different it'll
[1:24:48] be than the rest of them yeah
[1:24:51] hey man come on now yes brother Brown
[1:24:55] said see first you have to come out some
[1:24:57] people wants to bring the world in with
[1:24:58] them but you've got to come out of the
[1:25:00] world to enter into Christ you have to
[1:25:02] come out of unbelief to enter into Faith
[1:25:04] there cannot be one thing in your way to
[1:25:07] really have genuine Faith you must
[1:25:09] absolutely leave everything that's
[1:25:11] contrary to the word of God behind to
[1:25:14] enter into Faith so you see the
[1:25:16] prophet's Ministry is to help us leave
[1:25:19] everything behind no questions to it
[1:25:22] just say Amen to it and walk into
[1:25:25] genuine faith
[1:25:27] leaving everything behind
[1:25:31] praise God
[1:25:33] the prophet has told us things that are
[1:25:35] even our own body doesn't tell us
[1:25:37] even our own mind won't tell us
[1:25:40] how would you even stand up and say I'm
[1:25:42] Justified as though I've never done it
[1:25:46] but you have to believe it
[1:25:48] you have to leave all that doubt behind
[1:25:50] to enter into the faith
[1:25:52] can you say man and watch your prayer
[1:25:55] change
[1:25:58] brother Brian said you always were a son
[1:26:00] of God it
[1:26:01] say it right you never were saved on any
[1:26:05] given day you were always worth saved
[1:26:08] you have to leave all doubt behind and
[1:26:12] enter into that
[1:26:13] and what your prayer change
[1:26:15] see your prayer then it becomes a prayer
[1:26:17] faith that we're talking about not
[1:26:19] intellectual Faith but revelated faith
[1:26:21] and notice what brother Branham said God
[1:26:24] has been preparing the people to believe
[1:26:26] all things
[1:26:27] aren't you glad you're one of them God
[1:26:30] preparing us to believe for all things
[1:26:32] I'm not going to I'm not limiting God
[1:26:34] I'm not going to dissect everything and
[1:26:36] say God you can work this out but I'm
[1:26:38] going to leave that for I got to work
[1:26:39] this out myself because I I don't I I
[1:26:41] don't know amen no leave it all to God
[1:26:44] Leave It All To God can you say man we
[1:26:47] come to a place to where our faith is so
[1:26:49] great that we say God you're able to do
[1:26:51] the small things you're able to do the
[1:26:53] big things you're able to do the the
[1:26:54] things that seem silly you're able to do
[1:26:56] the things that so seem impossible God
[1:26:59] you're able to do it all I believe that
[1:27:01] you are
[1:27:03] it's a faith
[1:27:05] this bride is actually entering in into
[1:27:09] this bride
[1:27:12] amen
[1:27:14] we're entering into
[1:27:17] the second phase
[1:27:19] and and I'm going to be honest I believe
[1:27:22] we're entered in
[1:27:24] I believe we're entered in you say well
[1:27:26] that's the Rapture no no no
[1:27:28] there's promises here that's attainable
[1:27:31] what about adoption of sons
[1:27:33] what about the placing of sons
[1:27:36] what about the power of God coming back
[1:27:39] up into the church
[1:27:40] can you say man
[1:27:42] amen that's right you can't tell me that
[1:27:45] you're going to sit here powerless and
[1:27:46] nothing and no experience with God and
[1:27:48] that I'm just a church goer and all that
[1:27:50] and the most the main thing that we
[1:27:52] could focus on is legalism and the do's
[1:27:54] and the don'ts and this and that and
[1:27:56] that's all we know about spirituality
[1:28:00] there's more to that than
[1:28:02] there's such a power of God that we
[1:28:05] could have
[1:28:06] and if we're not tapped into that here
[1:28:09] how we going over there
[1:28:11] brother Ram said you gotta have perfect
[1:28:13] Faith here not perfect Faith doesn't go
[1:28:15] over there we don't get perfect fake
[1:28:17] there we get perfect Faith here that's
[1:28:19] what the message is all about is to
[1:28:22] bring us into a perfect faith that when
[1:28:24] we pray we have power with God when we
[1:28:27] speak God backs our words up
[1:28:30] amen amen that's right so we're actually
[1:28:34] entering into this by this Joshua
[1:28:37] Ministry in this last day which is the
[1:28:39] message of the hour I'm sure you believe
[1:28:42] that Joshua in Hebrew brother Brown said
[1:28:45] Joshua in Hebrew means Savior and
[1:28:46] represents the promised end time leader
[1:28:49] to take the church over Caleb represents
[1:28:51] the True Believer who stayed with Joshua
[1:28:53] can you say man now we have people
[1:28:56] trying to be saved we have people trying
[1:28:58] to be healed we have people trying to be
[1:28:59] delivered we have people try try try
[1:29:02] there is no such thing as try in
[1:29:05] Christianity there's no such thing as
[1:29:07] try with faith
[1:29:10] but they're trying because it's an
[1:29:13] intellectual Faith they have faith in
[1:29:15] the mind but brother Branham says your
[1:29:18] mind will reason on it and say well now
[1:29:20] let's see it said this the doctor said
[1:29:23] this mother said this Dad said this the
[1:29:25] Pastor said this well see now that's
[1:29:27] what intellectual faith is oh I believe
[1:29:29] the Bible yes sir I think it's right but
[1:29:31] you know you know see you're trying to
[1:29:33] reason that's intellectual faith
[1:29:40] you notice what kind of Faith the
[1:29:42] disciples had before they received the
[1:29:44] Holy Ghost they walked with Jesus talked
[1:29:46] with him Peter was a bosom friend
[1:29:48] of of Jesus but he got so discouraged
[1:29:52] after Jesus died and was buried and and
[1:29:55] the Bible tells us that Peter just said
[1:29:57] well I'm going fish it
[1:29:58] skip all this
[1:30:00] I'm I'm going fishing and the other says
[1:30:03] well if you're going fishing we're going
[1:30:04] to
[1:30:07] ain't that right so being discouraged
[1:30:10] they they picked up their Nets and they
[1:30:12] went fishing and and all that brother
[1:30:13] Brian said they were believer ones
[1:30:15] mental theology
[1:30:19] but but their faith was dashed
[1:30:22] we thought this was the one apparently
[1:30:24] not let's go fishing
[1:30:26] let's continue what we were before he
[1:30:28] called us
[1:30:29] ain't that right
[1:30:30] but he said it was mental it was mental
[1:30:33] faith
[1:30:34] it was mental theology see he said they
[1:30:36] once believed they believed once in the
[1:30:39] natural see but when a little trial come
[1:30:41] up it went all to pieces their faith
[1:30:43] went to pieces
[1:30:46] are you with me yeah we kind of making
[1:30:48] some sense their faith went to Pieces it
[1:30:52] all went to pieces
[1:30:56] so this he says this only shows that
[1:30:59] when a man has only intellectual Faith
[1:31:01] by saying yes that's the word of God yes
[1:31:03] I believe that God Rose Jesus up from
[1:31:05] the dead but if that's all you've got
[1:31:07] then the first little discouragement
[1:31:08] that comes up in your church away you go
[1:31:10] and going out
[1:31:12] see he says you might be a friend to him
[1:31:14] but you don't know him in the power of
[1:31:18] his resurrection
[1:31:20] he says never one time after Pentecost
[1:31:22] did that preacher Peter ever say such a
[1:31:24] thing as that again
[1:31:26] see when they got ready to kill him they
[1:31:28] was going to hang him on a cross and he
[1:31:31] said I'm not even worthy to die like
[1:31:33] that turn my feet up my head down
[1:31:35] because my Lord died in that position
[1:31:37] with his head up yes never never see he
[1:31:39] was with Christ then but then Christ was
[1:31:42] in Peter Peter was doing the leading
[1:31:45] then and after the Holy Spirit come then
[1:31:47] the Holy Spirit was doing the leading
[1:31:48] Peter was in the backgrounds and the
[1:31:51] Holy Spirit Led on he said see if you've
[1:31:54] just got good reasoning you'll sit down
[1:31:56] and try to reason out the Bible reason
[1:31:57] well how could he raise from the dead
[1:31:59] how could these Miracles and things take
[1:32:01] place today in this great realm of
[1:32:03] civilization science that we live in see
[1:32:06] you try to reason that out and you're
[1:32:08] just getting further and further away
[1:32:09] from God all the time don't reason how
[1:32:11] the miracle is going to come just
[1:32:13] believe it don't reason how how God is
[1:32:16] going to save your child don't even try
[1:32:17] to think of how they're going to come in
[1:32:19] and how he's going to do it and and
[1:32:21] which way amen is it possible to figure
[1:32:23] it out
[1:32:24] you're dealing you're praying for
[1:32:26] something that is totally impossible but
[1:32:28] With God all things are possible
[1:32:33] so he said you try to reason that out
[1:32:35] and you get further away from God all
[1:32:37] the time you'll never know him by reason
[1:32:39] and God's not known by reason God's
[1:32:41] known by faith you accept it you believe
[1:32:45] it you can't do it until something
[1:32:47] happens in you and then the Holy Spirit
[1:32:49] comes in and you have the mind of Christ
[1:32:54] and you say amen he said notice they had
[1:32:57] all they all fished they fished and they
[1:33:00] caught no fish very discouraging
[1:33:04] the next morning early at the Sunrise
[1:33:06] Service they looked across the bank and
[1:33:08] there stood Jesus but they didn't know
[1:33:11] him
[1:33:11] and he says that's the sad part they
[1:33:13] didn't know him
[1:33:15] then you say Amen so see uh uh
[1:33:19] intellectual faith will not work because
[1:33:21] it will not bring you into fellowship
[1:33:23] with God and brother Brown said most
[1:33:25] most of the church stops at intellectual
[1:33:28] Faith they know about God but they're
[1:33:30] dead they're dry they're they're formal
[1:33:32] they they they they're without an
[1:33:34] experience and when you get that type of
[1:33:36] a man behind behind the pulpit he'll
[1:33:38] make this he'll heal me I'll just be
[1:33:40] honest he'll make a church service say a
[1:33:42] a a a a classroom
[1:33:45] foreign
[1:33:46] no anointing no Spirit no inspiration
[1:33:49] you get a man just with just
[1:33:50] intellectual Faith leading song service
[1:33:52] he'll quench the spirit every time
[1:33:53] because he doesn't know anything about
[1:33:56] the moving of the spirit of God
[1:33:58] it'll be the same way with musicians
[1:34:01] it's the same way with choirs it's to
[1:34:04] say there weren't more worried about the
[1:34:05] robes
[1:34:06] than the art the spirit of God
[1:34:10] you understand what I'm saying
[1:34:12] see you've got to have the spirit of God
[1:34:15] so intellectual Faith affects the prayer
[1:34:18] way the prayer is is prayed brother
[1:34:20] Brown said you you have intellectual
[1:34:22] faith and you'll argue every scripture
[1:34:24] do everything you can backwards and
[1:34:26] everything else see you say there's no
[1:34:28] such thing as Divine Healing there's no
[1:34:30] such thing as heartfelt religion no such
[1:34:32] thing as the Holy Ghost you'll fuss and
[1:34:34] stew all the time and know not what
[1:34:35] you're talking about see he says how can
[1:34:38] you believe when there's nothing in
[1:34:40] there to believe with certainly see how
[1:34:42] can you get blood from a turnip when
[1:34:43] there's no blood in the turnip see
[1:34:45] you've got to be born again of the
[1:34:47] spirit of God or you'll never be able to
[1:34:49] come on Fellowship grounds with the God
[1:34:51] Almighty himself see for it's only upon
[1:34:54] the basis of the shed blood does he
[1:34:56] receive any believer and how can you
[1:34:58] believe when there's nothing there to
[1:35:00] believe with just a carnal Mind through
[1:35:02] mental conception
[1:35:04] he said you can't do it that's the
[1:35:06] reason people don't believe in Divine
[1:35:07] Healing because they've never walked
[1:35:09] into that bloodstream to The Fellowship
[1:35:11] of the Lord Jesus Christ he said you got
[1:35:13] an intellectual Faith oh you believe the
[1:35:15] word and you mix it and make it suit
[1:35:17] your theology but once you come into the
[1:35:20] kingdom of God through the blood of the
[1:35:22] Lord Jesus meeting upon the shed blood
[1:35:24] uh bought through the testimony the
[1:35:28] public testimony of the Crimson blood of
[1:35:30] the Lord you are here you are in here in
[1:35:34] Fellowship where God can bless you you
[1:35:36] can shout praise the Lord and the powers
[1:35:38] of God working why it's God himself his
[1:35:42] own body the mystical body of the Lord
[1:35:45] Jesus Christ here on Earth operating
[1:35:47] upon the basis of the shed blood
[1:35:50] and you say man
[1:35:51] so then a man cannot accurately pray a
[1:35:55] prayer of faith
[1:35:56] with just intellectual faith
[1:36:01] that brother Graham said when your faith
[1:36:02] comes out comes from out of the
[1:36:05] intellectual realm and the Holy Spirit
[1:36:07] puts it in the soul and the heart you
[1:36:09] won't even think about these things all
[1:36:11] right you won't think about well how can
[1:36:13] it be done
[1:36:15] well how how when is going to happen
[1:36:18] well I don't know you won't think about
[1:36:20] it because it's dropped from the
[1:36:22] intellectual and to the heart now
[1:36:24] can you say Amen so then it becomes the
[1:36:27] the the the prayer of faith that that
[1:36:29] we're talking about see he said see you
[1:36:32] won't try it see to see nothing only
[1:36:34] thing you know that it's going to happen
[1:36:36] regardless of who says it's not that's
[1:36:39] it it's in the heart God puts it in
[1:36:41] there there it is when God puts it in
[1:36:44] there all the Devils out of Torment Will
[1:36:46] Never Move it if you if you were laying
[1:36:48] down now notice what he says if you were
[1:36:50] laying down
[1:36:51] grasping gasping your breath and and
[1:36:55] death rattles in your throat 50 doctors
[1:36:57] standing around saying he's going out to
[1:36:59] God in the next five minutes he's
[1:37:01] leaving now and down in your heart you
[1:37:03] believe Jesus Christ that healed you
[1:37:05] that won't bother you a bit
[1:37:10] why it's faith in the heart
[1:37:15] just as sure as there's a God in heaven
[1:37:17] you'd come out of it yes sir because
[1:37:19] God's Duty bound everybody say God's
[1:37:21] Duty bound he's got to keep his word and
[1:37:24] you'll never know what Christ is or what
[1:37:26] the is the word until first the Holy
[1:37:29] Spirit has personally revealed it to you
[1:37:30] in your heart then you know that Jesus
[1:37:32] is Lord when your heart says so not when
[1:37:35] your knowledge says so but when your
[1:37:37] heart said so that's when you know it
[1:37:42] another place brother Brown said if we
[1:37:44] only need need the intellectual
[1:37:45] conception of man we don't need the Holy
[1:37:47] Spirit if the church is to be run and
[1:37:49] governed upon the intellectuals and the
[1:37:51] educational program upon the
[1:37:53] intellectuals of mankind we do not need
[1:37:55] the Holy Spirit if it's to be run by the
[1:37:58] Holy Spirit we do not need the
[1:38:00] intellectuals it's either one or the
[1:38:02] other can you say Amen one or the other
[1:38:04] now as as we move on for just a few more
[1:38:08] moments faith faith must have a
[1:38:11] foundation to be built upon to to rest
[1:38:13] upon to to to to and there's no other
[1:38:17] foundation for Faith to rest upon
[1:38:19] outside the word of God and why why why
[1:38:22] is it that it's the word of God because
[1:38:24] scripture Jesus said the scriptures
[1:38:27] cannot be broken
[1:38:28] amen it it's it's it's just that way and
[1:38:32] he said another place all scriptures
[1:38:34] must be fulfilled so brother Brown would
[1:38:36] tell us then he says how much more
[1:38:38] Foundation could you place your faith on
[1:38:40] any level than the word of God what more
[1:38:43] could you put your faith in ain't that
[1:38:46] right we find there in Mark 13 31 Jesus
[1:38:49] said Heaven and Earth shall pass away
[1:38:51] but my word shall never pass
[1:38:56] talking about faith now
[1:38:59] prayer of faith my word will never pass
[1:39:02] away so then that means his word is
[1:39:05] eternal
[1:39:06] ain't that right but not only is it any
[1:39:08] is it Eternal it's a promise to us
[1:39:13] and you say that with me the word of God
[1:39:15] is a promise to me
[1:39:19] the word of God is a promise see brother
[1:39:22] brannerman speaking of Abraham said that
[1:39:25] he had to lay his faith upon God's
[1:39:27] promised word
[1:39:29] yet look at it just the word but now he
[1:39:32] looked up on it as a promise God's
[1:39:35] promised word Abraham's Faith laid upon
[1:39:38] God's promised word look at what God
[1:39:40] told Simeon that he would not see death
[1:39:42] until he seen the Christ child and that
[1:39:45] old man 80 years old or so have a Gray
[1:39:48] beard gray hair and and and and all that
[1:39:51] but he went around telling everybody I
[1:39:52] will not die I will not die till I see
[1:39:54] the Lord's Christ I will not die a man
[1:39:57] why he had a confession his faith amen
[1:40:00] was so strong amen may have become a
[1:40:02] personal revelation upon the promise of
[1:40:05] God
[1:40:06] upon the promise ain't that right
[1:40:08] brother Brown said that old man had a
[1:40:10] basis for his faith the promises of God
[1:40:13] in another place he said your faith has
[1:40:16] got a foundation and that is because God
[1:40:19] promised it can you say it with me God
[1:40:22] promised it so I now I have an
[1:40:24] understanding my faith is now come to me
[1:40:27] because I have an understanding of what
[1:40:30] God has promised
[1:40:33] yeah
[1:40:34] praise the Lord
[1:40:36] not just someone reading the Bible to me
[1:40:39] it's not just me reading the Bible and
[1:40:41] once a year all the way through and say
[1:40:43] wow I've done that it's not me learning
[1:40:45] scriptures and learning how to quote
[1:40:47] them and quote quote quote amen all that
[1:40:49] but now I have an understanding that
[1:40:51] this word has promises for me
[1:40:54] [Music]
[1:40:55] oh what a prayer faith
[1:41:01] Amen brother Branham says he said the
[1:41:04] very world you're sitting on top of
[1:41:07] tonight is nothing more than the word of
[1:41:09] God materialized he spoke the word and
[1:41:12] said let there be and the world came
[1:41:14] into existence all things that you see
[1:41:16] was made by faith in the spoken word of
[1:41:18] God God said let there be and he
[1:41:21] believed his own word man he believed
[1:41:25] his own word well after Redemption
[1:41:27] notice now after Redemption and the
[1:41:30] taste of God in our souls and harm how
[1:41:33] much more we to base our faith on what
[1:41:36] God has given us the promise for and
[1:41:40] sent Jesus to die to redeem us through
[1:41:42] that promise he came to redeem us back
[1:41:46] to the promises
[1:41:51] you understand
[1:41:52] promises don't belong to me because I've
[1:41:55] got intellectual Faith about what God
[1:41:56] Said
[1:41:57] but now I have the understanding of
[1:41:59] redemption
[1:42:02] it's one thing to say well I'm going to
[1:42:03] heaven that's that's wonderful we're
[1:42:05] going to heaven but what about right now
[1:42:07] what about the promises he redeemed you
[1:42:09] too
[1:42:10] oh I'm going to heaven but I sure don't
[1:42:12] know if I could ever reach adoption what
[1:42:14] he would redeem you to eternal life and
[1:42:17] cannot put you into an adoption
[1:42:23] it shouldn't be strange to us that a man
[1:42:26] could stand in this day and speak
[1:42:27] squirrels into existence
[1:42:29] it ought to give us more faith that if
[1:42:31] he can do it something can God that same
[1:42:33] God can get a hold of my lips
[1:42:35] that same God can unction me to do
[1:42:37] something
[1:42:38] is he redeemed that Prophet to do death
[1:42:40] amen and to go back to what Adam was and
[1:42:43] call squirrels
[1:42:45] that was no squirrels into existence
[1:42:47] what can he do about my situation
[1:42:52] why he redeemed you to it he redeemed
[1:42:55] you to these promises
[1:42:58] and you say Amen so then then it's not
[1:43:02] just Faith cometh by hearing but now
[1:43:04] we're having the understanding of
[1:43:06] promises this Bible is full of promises
[1:43:09] for me
[1:43:11] can you say Amen
[1:43:14] amen we base our faith on the promise
[1:43:17] that God has redeemed us to you see we
[1:43:20] do not pray then by what we see we do
[1:43:22] not Pray by what we feel we pray by what
[1:43:25] we believe
[1:43:26] we do not pray according to our reason
[1:43:28] we pray according to what God has
[1:43:30] promised
[1:43:32] then you say Amen we pray to what God
[1:43:34] has promises I hope I hope that when you
[1:43:37] play taste I hope you do play tapes I
[1:43:39] hope you play them in your home don't
[1:43:40] ever get too busy you can't play tapes
[1:43:42] we ought to be matured enough to be able
[1:43:45] to play tapes in our home
[1:43:48] don't take your message I don't just
[1:43:51] think you're a message believer if you
[1:43:52] don't play tapes in your hole
[1:43:54] that Prophet shouldn't even be his voice
[1:43:56] shouldn't be strange to you in your home
[1:43:58] in your car wherever you are you ought
[1:44:00] to be playing them tape why they're
[1:44:02] promises
[1:44:04] these are promises that God has redeemed
[1:44:07] us to
[1:44:12] find out what God has promised for this
[1:44:14] hour
[1:44:15] God promised that in this hour the sons
[1:44:18] of God would be manifested
[1:44:20] we wouldn't even know that except the
[1:44:22] Prophet come and told us that God
[1:44:24] promised in this hour to sound the
[1:44:26] trumpet of Jubilee and those that heard
[1:44:27] the sound and believed in it and acted
[1:44:30] upon it could go free that's a promise
[1:44:32] for this hour do you believe it you
[1:44:35] don't have to be bound you can be free
[1:44:38] yes sir God promised in this hour to
[1:44:40] change our vile body from Mortal to
[1:44:43] immortality from corruption to
[1:44:44] incorruption that's the promise that God
[1:44:47] has redeemed us doing this hour
[1:44:50] God promised in this hour that if we'd
[1:44:52] speak to the mountain and doubt not what
[1:44:54] we say we shall have what we say
[1:44:57] that's a promise for this hour do you
[1:44:59] believe that
[1:45:01] well some of us do anyways
[1:45:03] do you believe that church
[1:45:05] I've redeemed you to these things
[1:45:12] you realize this is the hour of
[1:45:14] restoration of all things
[1:45:18] you love the Lord
[1:45:20] I get passionate about what I preach so
[1:45:22] you just have to bear with me I just get
[1:45:24] passionate I'm thinking if God so loved
[1:45:26] me that he would redeem that he said
[1:45:28] these promises to me and me to these
[1:45:30] promises why can I act upon them
[1:45:34] I don't know about you but the devil
[1:45:35] whips me all the time he's he's all this
[1:45:37] time trying to get in my brain he's all
[1:45:39] the time trying to bring discouragement
[1:45:41] he's all the tribe but somewhere amen
[1:45:43] I'm just going to say you know what
[1:45:44] devil I'm going to tell you a thing or
[1:45:46] two
[1:45:48] you understand what I'm saying what's
[1:45:49] wrong with me about getting excited I'm
[1:45:51] the one that's got the promises he don't
[1:45:54] he ain't got no right over my life God
[1:45:57] redeemed me to these promises
[1:45:59] so I'm not going to let him affect my
[1:46:01] prayer I'm not going to let him know
[1:46:03] affect the way I speak to God
[1:46:09] pray oh woe is me Lord
[1:46:12] I don't know
[1:46:14] have you ever found yourself doing that
[1:46:18] well I am
[1:46:20] Lord where are you
[1:46:23] I don't know
[1:46:26] that's the devil's language
[1:46:30] I'm telling off of myself brother Bill
[1:46:36] why can't I Take God at his word
[1:46:38] amen what's wrong with quoting the word
[1:46:41] what's wrong with quoting what a prophet
[1:46:43] said to the devil
[1:46:45] the devil hates this message just as
[1:46:47] much he hates that Bible
[1:46:49] but more than anything he hates it when
[1:46:51] it comes from the heart of a believer
[1:46:53] when it comes from a mouth of a Believer
[1:46:55] he hates it
[1:46:57] because the man the woman the boy girl
[1:46:59] actually believes it
[1:47:04] ain't that right
[1:47:06] so the foundation of our faith
[1:47:11] is the promises for this hour
[1:47:15] the promises come from this world
[1:47:18] so our understanding comes
[1:47:20] from this word and we understand the
[1:47:22] promises that are given to us now
[1:47:25] brother Brian said Faith holds that
[1:47:27] faith that holds the word of God yields
[1:47:29] the power of God
[1:47:30] can you say that with me faith that
[1:47:32] holds the word of God
[1:47:34] yields the power of God
[1:47:37] the power of God should not be strange
[1:47:39] to us
[1:47:40] faith that holds the word of God yields
[1:47:43] the power of God the person has the
[1:47:46] faith to hold the word of God has also
[1:47:48] the power to is the one that yields the
[1:47:51] power of God
[1:47:54] ain't that right then brother Brown said
[1:47:56] then you're persistent then you're
[1:47:59] persistent you're not going to back down
[1:48:01] off the devil you're not going to say
[1:48:03] well I don't know if I can do it I don't
[1:48:04] know if I'm doing this in vain I don't
[1:48:05] know I just you know it just seems like
[1:48:07] I'm spinning my wheels I just don't know
[1:48:09] I don't know don't know what's the use
[1:48:10] of praying what's he used to believe in
[1:48:11] what's the use of listen to Faith what's
[1:48:13] the use of going to church what's the
[1:48:14] use of that it's only in the
[1:48:16] intellectual Faith but if you could get
[1:48:19] the right Faith the hard Faith Amen to
[1:48:21] know that that God that will keep his
[1:48:24] word that God honors his word that this
[1:48:27] is the promises for me on this day you
[1:48:30] the one that will yield the power of God
[1:48:34] well I don't have any sensation I don't
[1:48:36] feel nothing it doesn't matter do you
[1:48:38] realize that it does not matter
[1:48:40] it's not Sensation that yields the power
[1:48:43] of God
[1:48:44] it's faith
[1:48:46] faith is what yields the power the man
[1:48:50] that has faith in the word of God for
[1:48:53] this hour can you say Amen brother Brown
[1:48:56] said it's the faith for this hour
[1:48:58] [Music]
[1:48:59] is the one that yields the power of God
[1:49:03] you say well I've trained speaking
[1:49:05] squirrels into existence that may not be
[1:49:06] what God's called you to do but you
[1:49:08] still have that power
[1:49:12] amen well I don't see anything happening
[1:49:14] to my child
[1:49:16] well brother Bram didn't see no
[1:49:17] squirrels either
[1:49:20] he said he sat there all day and there
[1:49:22] was no squirrels but all of a sudden
[1:49:24] something said how many squirrels do you
[1:49:26] want
[1:49:29] you understand what I'm saying Speak
[1:49:33] that same God
[1:49:34] can move upon us
[1:49:36] move upon you
[1:49:40] so what do you want
[1:49:42] look at Hattie
[1:49:44] brother Bram didn't tell her what she
[1:49:45] needed
[1:49:46] she spoke it
[1:49:49] yes sir she spoke it
[1:49:52] you love the Lord
[1:49:55] so according to the scriptures our faith
[1:49:58] isn't to stand in an intellectual
[1:49:59] explanation of the word
[1:50:03] and the Apostle Paul made sure that it
[1:50:05] didn't come that way the prophet of this
[1:50:08] hour and every Minister ought to be that
[1:50:10] way and and not only just ministers but
[1:50:12] you mothers fathers
[1:50:13] anyone that's handling the word speaking
[1:50:15] the word
[1:50:18] it should not no man's face should be
[1:50:20] built upon intellectual explanation
[1:50:25] for the Bible says the letter killeth
[1:50:27] but the spirit giveth life
[1:50:30] First Corinthians 2 and 1 and I Brethren
[1:50:33] when I came to you came not with
[1:50:35] Excellency of speech or of wisdom
[1:50:38] declaring unto you the testimony of God
[1:50:40] for I determined not to know anything
[1:50:42] among you saved Jesus Christ and him
[1:50:44] crucified and I was with you in much
[1:50:47] weakness and in fear and in much
[1:50:49] trembling in my speech and my preaching
[1:50:51] was not with enticing words of man's
[1:50:53] Wisdom
[1:50:55] but in demonstration of the spirit and
[1:50:57] the power that your faith should not
[1:51:00] stand in the wisdom of men but in the
[1:51:02] power of God
[1:51:04] so the the genuine true gospel is the
[1:51:07] word made Power
[1:51:09] and Paul came in dense demonstration of
[1:51:15] spirit and Power
[1:51:18] why so that their faith could rest in
[1:51:21] the promised word
[1:51:24] hello
[1:51:26] now brother bear I'm talking about Paul
[1:51:27] said the greatest Theologian that ever
[1:51:29] lived said he had to forget everything
[1:51:30] that he ever knowed in order to find
[1:51:33] Christ and said I don't preach the
[1:51:35] intellectual things I preach the
[1:51:37] simpleness of the leading of the Holy
[1:51:38] Spirit
[1:51:39] see so he preached the word by
[1:51:41] demonstrating the power of the
[1:51:43] resurrection of Jesus Christ
[1:51:45] and so the the promised word everybody
[1:51:48] say the promised word I think that's
[1:51:50] that's that's so important to understand
[1:51:52] the promised word was demonstrated to
[1:51:55] the People by the power of God so to
[1:51:58] direct the faith of the people away from
[1:52:00] man
[1:52:01] brother Branham says in this here he
[1:52:04] says when the Holy Ghost comes and
[1:52:05] reveals the word and makes it live just
[1:52:08] exact then it's a revelation to you you
[1:52:11] see it it's unfolded it's promised for
[1:52:14] the hour
[1:52:16] aren't you glad for that
[1:52:18] God didn't send us a theologian God
[1:52:21] didn't send us an intellectual to
[1:52:23] preacher just give us an intellectual
[1:52:25] speech God sent someone that can make
[1:52:28] Christ live among us and make this word
[1:52:32] live among us to where we could see the
[1:52:34] word manifest every promise and when we
[1:52:37] see the word here and then we see it
[1:52:39] before our lives it gives us a faith
[1:52:43] it gives us a faith it's unfolded so our
[1:52:47] faith is in the promised word of the
[1:52:49] hour
[1:52:50] and and so when we as the elect
[1:52:53] recognize the word is being fulfilled
[1:52:56] then we know that God is on the scene
[1:52:58] can you say Amen how many times people
[1:53:01] thought well God's on the scene
[1:53:02] Pentecostals you know go back to that
[1:53:04] now that's where I came from and that
[1:53:06] was the most visible things if God was
[1:53:09] on the scene someone danced someone done
[1:53:10] cartwheels oh God's on the scene amen so
[1:53:13] many times it didn't have preaching
[1:53:15] because we had a we had a powerful
[1:53:17] service and everybody tuckered out by
[1:53:19] running around and dancing and shouting
[1:53:21] and all that and you know good and well
[1:53:22] I'm I'm all for all that amen but the
[1:53:25] word did not have the preeminence at all
[1:53:27] and and everybody was up and down every
[1:53:30] uh because we all went my feelings
[1:53:32] can you say man and so we thought God
[1:53:34] was among us because amen sung the fast
[1:53:36] songs and and beat the you know the
[1:53:38] piano and the drums and da da da da got
[1:53:40] that foot going you know and our pastor
[1:53:42] knew how to do that when he wanted a
[1:53:43] good service you know he knew how to do
[1:53:45] it see and then before you know it
[1:53:47] someone starts clapping and someone
[1:53:48] starts doing the doing a little dance he
[1:53:50] says Ah you got it you got it you got it
[1:53:52] you know and before you know it
[1:53:53] everything starts breaking out right
[1:53:56] well God had his way tonight he says
[1:54:03] well that's all we knew
[1:54:05] can you say man
[1:54:07] but then we realized that we recognize
[1:54:09] the word being fulfilled
[1:54:13] then we know God's Among Us
[1:54:15] God is on the scene can you say amen and
[1:54:18] notice what the Bible calls it the faith
[1:54:20] of God's elect
[1:54:22] the faith of God's elect Jesus was the
[1:54:25] light of the hour because he was the
[1:54:27] promised word of the hour and tried to
[1:54:29] tell them so but they were too much in
[1:54:31] darkness to understand it and he brother
[1:54:34] Brown said so is it today now he said
[1:54:36] you know there's something about being
[1:54:38] with Jesus that gives you an experience
[1:54:40] being around where he's at watching his
[1:54:43] work and then that gives you faith when
[1:54:46] you have experience it gives you faith
[1:54:48] faith goes by your experience now I've
[1:54:51] had experiences of of of of seeing
[1:54:54] people jump up and down and getting
[1:54:55] emotional and I've had it I've had
[1:54:57] experiences prophesying and speaking in
[1:54:59] tongues and and all these things I've
[1:55:01] had them experiences but then I found a
[1:55:03] greater experiences and that was when
[1:55:05] Christ was married made visible Among Us
[1:55:09] by the word being made known fulfilled
[1:55:12] can you say Amen no other man outside of
[1:55:15] Christ could stand up and say this day
[1:55:16] this scripture is being fulfilled as it
[1:55:19] has been in this day and no other people
[1:55:21] could look at the scripture from the Old
[1:55:23] Testament to the New Testament and stand
[1:55:25] here and say this day these scriptures
[1:55:27] are being fulfilled by us
[1:55:31] then you say Amen what does it do
[1:55:34] it gives us an understanding
[1:55:37] he gives us a faith to know that God is
[1:55:39] here
[1:55:41] brother Brown said why does God do
[1:55:42] miracles
[1:55:43] to give us an understanding
[1:55:46] the reason that God performed miracles
[1:55:48] in Egypt he was trying to get them to
[1:55:50] understand that he was God in their
[1:55:51] midst
[1:55:52] ain't that right
[1:55:54] so in closing but notice the Bible that
[1:55:57] was promised to be demonstrated to us in
[1:55:59] this last day
[1:56:01] Luke 21 25 and there shall be signs in
[1:56:04] the Sun
[1:56:06] and in the moon and in the stars and
[1:56:08] upon the Earth and distress of nations
[1:56:09] with perplexity the Sea and the ways
[1:56:12] roaring
[1:56:12] men's Hearts failing them for fear
[1:56:16] for looking after those things which are
[1:56:18] coming on the earth for the powers of
[1:56:19] Heaven shall be shaken and then they
[1:56:22] shall see the son of man coming in a
[1:56:24] cloud with power and great Glory
[1:56:27] and when these things begin to come to
[1:56:29] pass and look up and lift up your heads
[1:56:31] for your Redemption draweth nigh
[1:56:34] can you say man
[1:56:36] what is it we shall see the son of man I
[1:56:39] mean what a promise and this that's been
[1:56:41] laying there dormant all these time
[1:56:43] through these years
[1:56:44] until this age
[1:56:47] but what is it it's the show to us that
[1:56:50] Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today
[1:56:52] and forever
[1:56:53] our faith is not in a god of History our
[1:56:56] faith is not in a God that once was and
[1:56:58] once did and wants this and that but now
[1:57:00] our faith is in a present tense God that
[1:57:03] what he was back then he is the same
[1:57:05] today can you say man why because it's
[1:57:08] the son of man being revealed but Brian
[1:57:10] said it's the same power it's the same
[1:57:12] spirit it's the same works it's the same
[1:57:14] it's it's it's Jesus Christ the same in
[1:57:17] every aspect except the Corporal body
[1:57:21] ain't that right in every detail it's
[1:57:24] the same Messiah sign in demonstration
[1:57:27] can we say that is that not what it was
[1:57:30] in this age is that not what we saw was
[1:57:33] the Messiah sign done in this age the
[1:57:36] same sign that God used to to to to
[1:57:39] Abraham as God in flesh amen was the
[1:57:42] same sign that Jesus did God in Christ
[1:57:45] in Jesus done to the Jews and to the
[1:57:47] Samaritan woman and that same sign has
[1:57:50] been done in this today to show us that
[1:57:52] it wasn't a theologian it wasn't just a
[1:57:54] man it was God himself revealed to us
[1:57:57] and every promise is here to be
[1:57:59] fulfilled by us he's here to fulfill
[1:58:03] them
[1:58:04] he's redeemed us to these
[1:58:07] can you say Amen
[1:58:09] so what it is is giving us an
[1:58:11] understanding that God is among us so
[1:58:13] that our faith would not stand in the
[1:58:15] wisdom of men that our faith would not
[1:58:18] stand in our own feelings and our own
[1:58:21] selves in our own abilities he's here
[1:58:25] he's here
[1:58:27] can you say man
[1:58:29] you love him
[1:58:31] what we have seen in this age is the
[1:58:33] greatest demonstration that could ever
[1:58:35] be given to man
[1:58:37] why it's the sign of the resurrection of
[1:58:42] Jesus Christ
[1:58:43] it has given us a greater understanding
[1:58:46] of God than all the books that could be
[1:58:47] written
[1:58:49] it has given us some greater
[1:58:51] understanding of God than all the
[1:58:53] literary literary and all the Theology
[1:58:56] and all the seminaries and schools that
[1:58:59] could ever be
[1:59:00] this sign that has been given to us
[1:59:03] today
[1:59:04] that has shown Christ visible and showed
[1:59:08] his presence here Among Us can you say
[1:59:11] Amen Forest Jesus Christ himself being
[1:59:14] demonstrated Among Us
[1:59:15] brother Branham as we get ready to close
[1:59:18] but brother Brown said other ministers
[1:59:20] who who preached healing by the word it
[1:59:23] takes a long time to build in faith like
[1:59:25] that sometimes sometimes they say stay
[1:59:28] six eight ten weeks maybe three months
[1:59:30] because it's necessary for them to do
[1:59:31] that but up here on usual just to
[1:59:35] demonstrate to show what God has done in
[1:59:37] this way of this phenomenon it doesn't
[1:59:40] take long till the people first 15 or 20
[1:59:43] minutes if they're spiritual minded
[1:59:45] they'll catch it right away and then
[1:59:46] things begin to happen water Ministry
[1:59:49] Amen to build our faith up he said I'm
[1:59:52] convinced that it's the gospel and the
[1:59:54] power and demonstration of the
[1:59:56] resurrection of the peering of the Lord
[1:59:57] Jesus in this last day making the church
[1:59:59] ready to be caught away in The Bride Can
[2:00:02] you say Amen so then our faith is not
[2:00:04] standing
[2:00:06] a man in in the wisdom of men's
[2:00:09] uninspired teaching
[2:00:11] uninspired ways that our faith is
[2:00:14] standing in the power of the resurrected
[2:00:16] of Christ
[2:00:18] do you believe that
[2:00:19] we have seen Christ Jesus Christ made
[2:00:23] visible here today
[2:00:26] I love the Lord do you love him
[2:00:29] I love him with all my heart
[2:00:32] amen
[2:00:34] brother Branham
[2:00:36] said this Messiah sign was greater
[2:00:41] was greater a greater challenge
[2:00:44] than walking up to a crippled woman
[2:00:46] that's in a wheelchair
[2:00:48] and telling her to rise up and walk now
[2:00:51] you think of that for a moment
[2:00:54] when we hear Brother brannerman in
[2:00:55] prayer lines begin to read them tell
[2:00:57] them
[2:00:58] what they're doing what they've done
[2:01:00] what's wrong with him and all that he
[2:01:01] said it is a greater sign to you it's a
[2:01:04] greater challenge
[2:01:06] than it would be to go to a crippled
[2:01:08] woman
[2:01:09] has been in that wheelchair and say rise
[2:01:12] and walk
[2:01:14] he said because she could actually do
[2:01:16] that through psychic power that's right
[2:01:19] mental she could do it in Christian
[2:01:22] Science Faith it's been done but when
[2:01:25] you see Christ coming to the people and
[2:01:28] do the same manifestation of the sign of
[2:01:31] Heaven giving back in fulfilling of the
[2:01:34] word what a miracle what a power
[2:01:40] can you say man
[2:01:43] if the musicians will come
[2:01:48] we have been given the greatest sign
[2:01:50] that could be given
[2:01:52] so that we could understand Christ
[2:01:55] in the power of his resurrection
[2:02:00] if our faith was to stand in the wisdom
[2:02:03] of intellectual Giants then God would
[2:02:05] have sent us an intellectual
[2:02:09] the God sent a prophet
[2:02:13] and not only that
[2:02:16] he sent a prophet that would manifest
[2:02:18] the very same sign
[2:02:21] as Jesus did amen as Melchizedek did
[2:02:24] Melchizedek did it's the greatest sign
[2:02:27] that it could ever be
[2:02:30] think of that
[2:02:33] do you love him amen
[2:02:39] if you notice brother Brown said in his
[2:02:41] ministry was a Ministry of faith to get
[2:02:44] the people to just believe just believe
[2:02:46] just believe
[2:02:48] he tells when the angel of the Lord came
[2:02:50] to him and gave him his commission he
[2:02:52] said do not fear said I'm sent from the
[2:02:55] presence of God to tell you that you
[2:02:56] were born A peculiar birth and your
[2:02:58] peculiar life has been to indicate that
[2:03:01] you're to take a gift of Divine Healing
[2:03:03] to the people of the world I said sir
[2:03:05] I'm uneducated I couldn't go he said if
[2:03:07] you just get them to believe you and if
[2:03:10] you're sincere when you pray nothing
[2:03:11] shall stand before your prayer if you'll
[2:03:13] get them to believe you and I said but I
[2:03:15] bet they wouldn't even believe me sir he
[2:03:18] said you'll be given two signs as the
[2:03:19] prophet Moses was given to signs to get
[2:03:21] the people to believe you is is the
[2:03:24] really the issue he said one of them was
[2:03:27] detecting diseases just by holding the
[2:03:29] person's right hand and your left he
[2:03:31] said then if you'll be sincere and
[2:03:33] she'll come to pass that you'll tell the
[2:03:34] very secrets of the hearts and the
[2:03:37] things that they are doing wrong to
[2:03:39] build the faith in the people to be in
[2:03:42] faith and to vindicate you that God will
[2:03:45] send it to you
[2:03:46] another place he said God knows I know
[2:03:49] not what's wrong with you not not a one
[2:03:52] but under the anointing there's no one
[2:03:54] could come to this platform but what
[2:03:55] would be told just what is wrong with
[2:03:57] them and what they were and done in
[2:04:00] their life and maybe the cause of the
[2:04:01] sickness he said now what that is for is
[2:04:05] to build the faith of the patient
[2:04:07] another place brother Branham says in
[2:04:09] the prayer line he says he told the lady
[2:04:12] said I'm trying to build your faith to a
[2:04:14] place to get the anointing on you sister
[2:04:17] see when when the faith comes when our
[2:04:19] faith comes the anointing comes upon us
[2:04:22] so that's why he said I'm trying to
[2:04:23] build faith upon you I'm trying to get
[2:04:25] you you get and build your face so the
[2:04:27] anointing will come upon you see he said
[2:04:30] I feel that I've tried to project a
[2:04:32] Divine prophetic gift to build the faith
[2:04:34] of the people instead of using What's
[2:04:36] called the gift of healing by laying
[2:04:38] hands on people now a gift of healing is
[2:04:41] to be admired by laying your hands but
[2:04:43] now a prophetic gift he says see he told
[2:04:46] me that was given me and that that would
[2:04:48] make the people believe in other words
[2:04:50] here that's him speaking back saying
[2:04:52] that I've told the truth can you say
[2:04:54] Amen so so if I could say it this way
[2:04:56] has this message built to faith in you
[2:04:59] [Music]
[2:05:01] that's a bill faith in you
[2:05:04] that's what it was all for
[2:05:07] now notice what he says you believe what
[2:05:09] I said about God is true what I said
[2:05:11] about Christ is true what about uh about
[2:05:14] the Holy Spirit is true then the angel
[2:05:16] that has come down that God has sent
[2:05:17] down in this last days to bless his
[2:05:19] people after the preaching of his word
[2:05:21] see and that those things that faith has
[2:05:24] been built by ministers through the age
[2:05:26] and then to thank his loving kindness to
[2:05:28] come down in the last days and do
[2:05:30] something else for us to send a
[2:05:32] prophetic gift that would Magnify Him
[2:05:35] before the people to get the people to
[2:05:37] see that he's just the same today as he
[2:05:40] was back then
[2:05:42] oh my I say we have an understanding
[2:05:46] faith has been built
[2:05:48] one more quote he says the only thing
[2:05:50] that condemns you is your unbelief
[2:05:53] and if we can't have faith enough to
[2:05:55] believe God for little things that we
[2:05:56] are seek that we see taking place here
[2:06:00] and then try to muddle it up all up and
[2:06:03] say it's psychology it's mental
[2:06:04] telepathy or something like that how in
[2:06:06] the world are you going in the
[2:06:07] resurrection figure that out
[2:06:10] when your body will probably be not over
[2:06:13] Spoonful Of Ashes but God will raise it
[2:06:16] up can you say man
[2:06:18] so what he's done is to get our faith in
[2:06:21] the right direction get our faith in the
[2:06:23] right things ain't that right amen not
[2:06:25] faith in doctors not faith in in in in
[2:06:28] in intellectuals not faith and what Dr
[2:06:31] so-and-so says and this one says and
[2:06:33] that one says and this says that get
[2:06:35] Faith in the right direction and that's
[2:06:37] what God Among Us in this age and that
[2:06:42] power that is here that we're believing
[2:06:44] in that we believe did create the
[2:06:47] squirrels we do believe that that it did
[2:06:50] stop that snowstorm we believe that it
[2:06:53] did give Hattie right her children that
[2:06:56] same power that we believe in is going
[2:06:58] to raise up our bodies one of these days
[2:07:01] I believe it
[2:07:03] I believe it amen
[2:07:09] praise the Lord do you love him
[2:07:12] amen what song are we singing
