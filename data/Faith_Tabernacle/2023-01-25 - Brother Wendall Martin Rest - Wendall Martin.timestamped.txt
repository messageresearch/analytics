[18:17] trusted me okay just to share this here
[18:21] in the prayer request tonight I heard
[18:22] many things mentioned about cancer
[18:24] and just today I saw a clip someone had
[18:26] sent me of a Pentecostal preacher and he
[18:28] was in a meeting and he said the demon
[18:30] of cancer come in the building and
[18:33] laughed at him and he said what I'm
[18:34] going to do is go down there and laugh
[18:35] at it and dance on its head he was just
[18:38] carrying on I won't say carrying on but
[18:41] he was just acting on a lot of things
[18:42] and I just watched that and I thought
[18:44] how thankful we are to be trained under
[18:46] a prophet that the angel said if you
[18:49] just get the people to believe that not
[18:51] even cancer
[18:52] will stand in your way amen aren't you
[18:55] thankful for this message tonight let's
[18:57] approach him Heavenly Father

[19:01] here tonight with Believers Lord of
[19:03] Light precious faith
[19:04] Lord we're not gathered here tonight

[19:08] things are going but father there's a
[19:10] house full of Believers here tonight
[19:12] that are gathered here up on one promise
[19:14] and one principle and that's that Jesus
[19:17] Christ is the same yesterday today and
[19:19] forever and Lord what you've done in the
[19:21] past you're here doing in the present

[50:08] God bless you you may be seated
[50:12] amen I I've
[50:14] been dealing
[50:17] along the Oneness of of God and man for
[50:21] just a for a little while now and I'm
[50:24] not really um a teacher like brother
[50:27] Sean and um uh not near the preacher is
[50:32] he and and brother Andrew but
[50:36] um my my thoughts here
[50:39] uh I want to deal a little bit tonight
[50:42] on rest I I think 2023 I want it to be
[50:47] the year of rest for God's people amen
[50:51] arrest arresting of the soul the amen
[50:54] that that rest of the soul that
[50:56] regulates the thoughts and the emotions
[51:00] of the flesh
[51:01] now the Old Testament amen a type of the
[51:06] believer's position in Christ was the
[51:10] Sabbath amen it was it was a day of rest
[51:13] there was six days of Labor amen now six
[51:18] days of Labor six means a man it's a
[51:20] man's number amen it's man laboring and
[51:24] striving to to Really to no avail the uh
[51:29] their the the the wisest man or that
[51:32] that ever lived Solomon he said amen all
[51:36] is Vanity he all comes and all all goes
[51:40] to an end so anything that man has a man
[51:44] ends in vanity and death and sorrow so
[51:48] so six days of Labor that's that's man's
[51:52] number
[51:53] but the seventh day man was to rest from
[51:58] all his labor so they they he had that
[52:02] one day that seventh day amen it was the
[52:06] completion of the week it was the it was
[52:09] the ending of the six days of Labor and
[52:13] it was a resting from all the labors
[52:17] where you could rest and be in the
[52:20] presence of God Amen there was a there
[52:23] was a Sabbath for the land for the land
[52:26] to rest there was uh amen so so the
[52:30] Sabbath was was important because it was
[52:34] dealing with the rest that God was going
[52:38] to give his people now we know that that
[52:40] is just a type of you and me because we
[52:44] are in that sixth day amen we are man
[52:48] and everything about man is laborious
[52:50] amen we we labor we have to struggle
[52:53] where we strive to breathe we strive to
[52:57] to continue to live everything about man
[53:01] is is a striving where we can't live
[53:04] forever you have to you have to keep
[53:06] painting your house you have to keep uh
[53:08] your your car up you have to keep
[53:11] everything up everything is is is a
[53:14] constant labor Amen in order to keep
[53:18] things up
[53:19] can you say man so but when it comes to
[53:23] your soul Christ wanted to give you a
[53:27] rest amen arrest a seventh day Amen
[53:32] brother brother Brandon would say this
[53:34] entering in is not only an entering in
[53:36] but a remaining in amen the Bible
[53:39] teaches us about the Sabbath wrath rest
[53:42] for he that is entered into his rest
[53:44] amen it's not so it's not only an
[53:47] entering end but a remaining in the rest
[53:49] it's an eternal rest of which the
[53:52] seventh day is but a type seven is
[53:54] completion eight is the first day again
[53:57] and Jesus resurrection was on the first
[53:59] day of the week giving us eternal life
[54:02] and eternal Sabbath thus we see why God
[54:06] could not give us any one certain day of
[54:09] the week as the Sabbath rests amen we've
[54:12] entered into and do remain in our rest
[54:16] which Israel could not do having only a
[54:19] shadow of the true substance which we
[54:21] enjoy why go back to a shadow which we
[54:25] have a reality now how can we receive
[54:28] the rest or the continuing Sabbath is an
[54:30] invitation of Jesus Amen there in in
[54:33] Matthew 11 and 28 come unto me all ye
[54:36] that labor and are heavy laden and I
[54:39] will give you rest take my yoke upon you
[54:43] and learn of Me Jesus says and you shall
[54:47] find rest or the keeping of the Sabbath
[54:50] not a day but eternal life the Sabbath
[54:54] unto your souls
[54:57] Amen brother Adam says don't matter how
[54:59] long you have been laboring under the
[55:01] load of sin whether it is 10 years 30
[55:03] years or 50 years or longer amen would
[55:06] you come with your tired weary life and
[55:10] you will find his rest the true Sabbath
[55:15] Jesus will give you rest I want to tell
[55:18] you something tonight the world is
[55:20] looking for a rest but there's only one
[55:22] rest and that's in Jesus Christ
[55:24] amen we're not coming to church looking
[55:28] for a rest we come to church because we
[55:31] have found that rest in Christ we have
[55:35] found him to be the satisfier of the
[55:38] soul we'll praise the Lord amen there
[55:41] they're in Isaiah it talked about amen
[55:44] this coming rest that was coming and
[55:46] brother Brandon would say it would come
[55:47] to pass about 700 years later at
[55:50] Pentecost when they were all filled with
[55:52] the Holy Ghost exactly as it was said
[55:55] they would be that is the true Sabbath
[55:58] that was promised thus when they were
[56:00] filled with the Holy Ghost they ceased
[56:02] from the worldly works the worldly
[56:05] doings their evil ways and the Holy
[56:08] Ghost took charge of their lives and
[56:11] they entered into rest there is your
[56:14] rest that is your Sabbath it's not a day
[56:17] nor a year but the eternity of being
[56:21] feel and blessed in the Holy Spirit oh
[56:25] he says it is you ceasing and God doing
[56:28] amen it is God in you willing and doing
[56:32] of his good pleasure I see tonight there
[56:35] is a rest for the people of God oh God
[56:39] don't want us anxious in her heart
[56:40] anxious in her soul God wants us living
[56:44] in a rest that only he can be Amen
[56:47] brother radam talks about being in
[56:50] Christ believing I I I love this quote
[56:53] here that I'm fixing to read you amen he
[56:55] says now he says Jesus going to the lady
[56:58] the grave of Lazarus he said I am I am
[57:01] the resurrection and life he that
[57:03] believeth in me though he be dead yet
[57:07] shall he live whosoever liveth and
[57:09] believeth in me shall never die
[57:11] believeth in me not on me but in me
[57:15] being in him be leaving if you abide in
[57:19] me and my words in you in him believing
[57:24] he says oh my I hope the Holy Spirit
[57:26] gets that right down to you can you say
[57:29] Amen so we're not believing on Christ
[57:32] but we have been baptized into this
[57:37] sabbath we have been baptized into the
[57:41] life-giver when you've been baptized
[57:43] with the Holy Ghost you have been
[57:45] baptized into rest when you've been
[57:48] baptized into the Holy Ghost the Eternal
[57:51] powers of God are all around you
[57:56] well glory to God that should make you
[57:58] want to shout
[58:00] hey man he's just believing in him you
[58:02] cannot believe in him until you come in
[58:05] him or he comes in you and then you're
[58:08] believing in him then you have eternal
[58:11] life you're believing on him until you
[58:13] receive eternal life and then eternal
[58:15] life is God's life in you you are
[58:19] believing in him
[58:23] well glory to God Amen the Apostle Paul
[58:26] says Aaron First Corinthians 12 and 13
[58:28] by one Spirit are we all baptized into
[58:33] one body Jesus Christ can you say Amen
[58:36] what is what does baptize me it means
[58:39] submers it doesn't mean sprinkle it
[58:42] doesn't mean poor but it means to bury
[58:46] yourself well glory to God
[58:49] you realize that when you are baptized
[58:51] by the power of the Holy Spirit you are
[58:54] now engulfed in everything that God is
[58:58] you are now engulfed in every Hall of
[59:03] God's Eternal Powers you have
[59:05] surrounding you
[59:07] abiding
[59:09] now
[59:10] it's not work related some people say
[59:12] well in order to be in him you have got
[59:15] to pray every day that's abiding in him
[59:18] some people would say reading the Bible
[59:21] is abiding in him
[59:23] man good deeds
[59:25] is abiding in him
[59:27] but these are all simply these are
[59:29] simply tokens of your love to him that
[59:33] doesn't that doesn't make you anything
[59:35] to do with Christ
[59:36] can you say man use the things you do
[59:38] because you love him amen but you have
[59:41] to be baptized into him because God's
[59:44] looking for a Oneness
[59:46] amen God's desire for Redemption is to
[59:50] bring you back to your original position
[59:53] of being God again amen you are the
[59:58] miniature gods that he created to put
[1:00:00] here on the earth he didn't call you
[1:00:02] amen he said in a Pew and amen and you
[1:00:05] know and go through the motions but God
[1:00:07] called you to be at one with him and the
[1:00:10] only way you're going to be at one of
[1:00:12] them the only way you're going to find
[1:00:14] rest is to come into him
[1:00:19] can you see man
[1:00:22] in him
[1:00:23] oh I want to be lost in him
[1:00:27] hey Faith I want
[1:00:29] I want Stephen and swear I can't find my
[1:00:31] way back out
[1:00:33] hallelujah amen some you know when you
[1:00:36] go snorkeling sometimes you can get
[1:00:37] things can get a little bit scary even
[1:00:39] you go under the water and you think oh
[1:00:41] what if I go under a rock or what if I
[1:00:43] go under this and I never come back out
[1:00:45] hey remember when you when you dive into
[1:00:47] God when you dive into Christ I want to
[1:00:50] get lost in it I don't ever want to come
[1:00:52] back out again I I don't want to see
[1:00:54] things the way I used to see things I
[1:00:57] don't want to understand things the way
[1:00:58] that I used to understand things I want
[1:01:01] to be lost in his love
[1:01:04] church if we were ever getting lost in
[1:01:06] his love and we find that presence of
[1:01:09] God and we are so surrounded we would
[1:01:12] never see life again the way this world
[1:01:15] sees it
[1:01:18] I think we should
[1:01:20] pray like Jonah
[1:01:22] prayed amen
[1:01:23] he says that was cast me in the Deep
[1:01:26] in the midst of the Seas and the floods
[1:01:28] come past me about and all thy Billows
[1:01:31] and thy waves passed over me I say God
[1:01:34] let me be that let the holy spirit so
[1:01:37] take me in let me be so overwhelmed so
[1:01:41] submersed into the presence of God into
[1:01:44] that Eternal Fountain so swallowed up
[1:01:47] into Christ until he is my every thought
[1:01:51] until he's my ever pattern unto my every
[1:01:54] desire is him until everything that I I
[1:01:58] in my in him I move and I live and I
[1:02:01] have my being in him is where my desires
[1:02:03] and in him is where it is where I find
[1:02:07] my joy at can you see man amen listen
[1:02:10] who can surpass the depths of that great
[1:02:14] Fountain when you come to that Fountain
[1:02:17] you will never thirst again when you
[1:02:20] come to that Fountain oh come on church
[1:02:23] it's the very source of Grace it's the
[1:02:27] very source of love it's the very source
[1:02:30] of power it's the very source of eternal
[1:02:33] life when you come to that Fountain get
[1:02:36] lost in it
[1:02:39] hey
[1:02:41] it's not quotes
[1:02:43] in Bible verses
[1:02:46] I believe it was the Apostle Paul says
[1:02:49] who shall separate us from the love of
[1:02:51] Christ
[1:02:52] shall tribulation or distress or
[1:02:54] persecution or famine or any man
[1:02:57] nakedness or Pearl or sword
[1:03:00] I am persuaded somebody say I am I am
[1:03:03] persuaded that neither death nor life
[1:03:06] nor principalities nor angels nor
[1:03:09] anything present anything to come shall
[1:03:13] ever separate me from the love of God
[1:03:20] I don't care whether it's the Heights or
[1:03:22] the depths
[1:03:23] he says nothing shall separate us from

[1:04:02] heart oh come on Church
[1:04:05] Hallelujah
[1:04:06] but do you realize
[1:04:08] that when the Dove came down and landed
[1:04:12] upon Christ it was once again Heaven and
[1:04:16] Earth kissing one another
[1:04:19] it was God's holy spirit the devil's
[1:04:23] always symbol peace and rest it was the
[1:04:27] Holy Spirit resting Upon A man
[1:04:32] oh can you say man there's never been a
[1:04:36] time since Adam's fall that the dove
[1:04:39] could settle down upon a man
[1:04:43] and continue There
[1:04:45] oh come on now there's been doves that's
[1:04:48] come there's been Birds that's come and
[1:04:50] gone but this one the scripture made it
[1:04:52] very clear amen God told the prophet he
[1:04:56] says the one that you see the dove
[1:04:59] descending upon and remaining
[1:05:04] he's the one that's going to baptize
[1:05:08] into my rest
[1:05:10] he's the one that is going to baptize
[1:05:13] with the Holy Spirit oh come on Church
[1:05:16] oh we struggle too much amen we struggle
[1:05:20] and we win and we push and we scribe and
[1:05:23] we struggle amen when God is looking for
[1:05:26] you to take your position as Sons and
[1:05:30] Daughters of God
[1:05:34] can you say Amen
[1:05:36] the day the dove come
[1:05:38] brother Branham said Heaven and Earth
[1:05:41] kissed
[1:05:46] not mean much to you but
[1:05:48] knows that they're asked was coming to
[1:05:53] all of God's seed
[1:05:56] oh ye that are weary and you're heavy
[1:05:59] laden
[1:06:00] come unto me
[1:06:02] I'm the Sabbath
[1:06:04] I'm the baptizer I'm the one I'm God's
[1:06:08] gift to humanity to bring them back back
[1:06:13] into that rightful place free of
[1:06:15] condemnation free of distress free sin
[1:06:19] free free
[1:06:24] I'm Bracken to a rust
[1:06:29] oh

[1:06:34] me come into me there's no tiredness of
[1:06:37] your soul in me coming to me Satan can't

[1:06:44] hey hey man
[1:06:46] or do you love him
[1:06:48] amen yes
[1:06:51] now
[1:06:52] brother Branham would say he said now
[1:06:55] many bypassed that scripture
[1:06:58] but to me it's one of the most
[1:06:59] outstanding scriptures of the Bible
[1:07:00] That's when Heaven and Earth embraced
[1:07:03] when God came down in the form of a dove
[1:07:06] and went upon his son in the form of a
[1:07:08] lamb
[1:07:10] why did he choose the lamb and the dove
[1:07:12] because the dove could not abide with
[1:07:14] anything else but the lamb their Natures
[1:07:16] are the same and that's the reason the
[1:07:19] two could get along together their
[1:07:22] Natures were meek and humble and lowly
[1:07:26] and that's why they could dwell together
[1:07:30] when God and Christ became one when the
[1:07:34] Dove came and down on the lamb Heaven
[1:07:37] and Earth kissed each other God and
[1:07:41] Adam was reconciled
[1:07:45] together
[1:07:51] when you're baptized into him is the
[1:07:53] only time
[1:07:55] that you can ever become a lamb
[1:07:59] until then
[1:08:01] you're striving
[1:08:03] you're stickery
[1:08:05] yeah
[1:08:07] can't get along with anybody
[1:08:09] Hallelujah come on
[1:08:11] come on you can't you couldn't even get
[1:08:13] along with yourself
[1:08:15] before you got the Holy Ghost
[1:08:18] but Jesus was the first of the new
[1:08:21] creation
[1:08:23] Jesus didn't need to be born again he
[1:08:26] came that germ word seed right from the
[1:08:28] world oh
[1:08:30] but you are born again you're born of
[1:08:34] not the sexual seed but The
[1:08:36] Incorruptible seed of the word of God
[1:08:38] can you say man now your nature is a
[1:08:42] nature that doesn't just get along with
[1:08:45] God but you get along with yourself and
[1:08:48] you get along with your husband
[1:08:50] and you get along with your wife and you

[1:11:37] in our spirit
[1:11:40] come on
[1:11:42] the Christ has come
[1:11:44] to give us rest
[1:11:46] and you realize
[1:11:48] when that little baby comes up and I
[1:11:51] love it when they come to Poppy and
[1:11:53] they'll come up
[1:11:54] and I'll just lay I sit there and I'll
[1:11:56] hold them
[1:11:57] and I said you know what
[1:12:00] poppy loves you
[1:12:04] I said you know what mommy loves you
[1:12:09] you know what and they just all and then
[1:12:11] all of a sudden
[1:12:16] they're snoring
[1:12:18] they're sleeping
[1:12:20] they're resting
[1:12:22] God says come
[1:12:25] I want to give you and if God gave it to
[1:12:28] the to them the man Adam and told him
[1:12:31] you're going to labor for six days old
[1:12:35] Church of the Living God if we could
[1:12:37] just look at that type we have been on
[1:12:39] Earth for six days six thousand years
[1:12:42] and we're fixing to go into that
[1:12:45] Millennium we're fixing to have a day of
[1:12:48] rest no more labor no more worry no more
[1:12:53] heartache No More Death no more sorrow
[1:12:56] no more sickness we will be with him
[1:13:02] amen Hallelujah
[1:13:05] can you say man
[1:13:07] now
[1:13:08] so the new birth
[1:13:11] takes
[1:13:12] the old Stony heart
[1:13:14] and gives us the heart
[1:13:16] of a lamb
[1:13:19] you know he says now the reason they
[1:13:20] could dwell together
[1:13:22] the Bible says he saw the spirit of God
[1:13:24] like a dove and he said the Lamb of God
[1:13:28] Behold the Lamb of God the Dove came on
[1:13:30] the lamb and abode
[1:13:32] I like that abiding
[1:13:34] now if it was a lamb
[1:13:36] if the lamb would have snorted like a
[1:13:38] wolf or the dove wouldn't would have
[1:13:41] gone been gone and you know sometimes I
[1:13:43] wonder if that's the reasons that
[1:13:44] there's so much trouble in the church
[1:13:46] if we are the Lambs of God we should
[1:13:49] have the nature of lambs if we expect
[1:13:52] the dove to abide do you believe it
[1:13:55] amen he's asking the congregation do you
[1:13:56] believe it I'm asking you do you believe
[1:13:58] it and then brother Branham says I do
[1:14:01] if we'll watch that Dove the reason it
[1:14:05] stayed on the lamb because their Natures
[1:14:08] was the same and the reason that the
[1:14:11] dove stays on Christian Old Church of
[1:14:14] the Living God the reason the doves
[1:14:18] oh
[1:14:25] amen
[1:14:27] somebody say in him
[1:14:30] resting
[1:14:32] in him
[1:14:34] rest is the settleness of heart rest has
[1:14:37] the confidence that everything is okay
[1:14:39] rest is I am his creation rest is
[1:14:43] Philippians 1 and 6 being confident of
[1:14:45] this very thing that he which had begun
[1:14:47] a good work and you will perform it
[1:14:49] until the day of Jesus Christ resting is
[1:14:53] Psalms 40 and 2. he brought me out of a
[1:14:55] horrible pit out of the my reclaim and
[1:14:58] has sent me my feet upon a rock and
[1:15:01] established my goings rest
[1:15:06] yeah
[1:15:07] and he put a new song in my mouth
[1:15:09] he even prays into our God
[1:15:12] many shall see it in fear and Trust can
[1:15:14] you say Amen
[1:15:16] it's no wonder when you come into him
[1:15:18] the scripture says the fruit of the
[1:15:20] spirit now he gives us the fruit of the
[1:15:22] flesh
[1:15:23] and then and and then the Apostle gives
[1:15:26] us the fruit of the spirit now this is
[1:15:28] both happening in the same in a body the
[1:15:32] fruit of the flesh
[1:15:35] he's enmity and strife
[1:15:37] jealousy murder and can you say man
[1:15:41] but with the dove coming Upon Us whole
[1:15:44] church now he says there's another fruit
[1:15:48] coming out naked and it says but the
[1:15:50] fruit they're in Galatians 5 and 22 but
[1:15:52] the fruit of the spirit is love joy
[1:15:55] peace long-suffering gentleness goodness
[1:15:59] Faith meekness Temperance against such
[1:16:01] there is no law it's no wonder that
[1:16:03] Jesus is there in John 15 and 7. if you
[1:16:06] abide in me and my words abide in you
[1:16:10] you shall ask what you will and it shall
[1:16:15] be done why because God and man have
[1:16:19] come together once again
[1:16:24] hey man
[1:16:25] hey man all right it's God
[1:16:31] to himself
[1:16:33] oh Church
[1:16:35] throw your Labor's behind
[1:16:37] throw your trucks down and run to Daddy
[1:16:41] through all of your nonsense away and
[1:16:44] come into him who gives and baptizes us
[1:16:48] into rest
[1:16:50] [Music]
[1:16:52] young man young woman
[1:16:55] I know
[1:16:57] the pressure's on us
[1:17:00] I know you young men
[1:17:02] and you young women
[1:17:03] the pressure is on you
[1:17:05] to conform to this world
[1:17:07] but it's all vanity
[1:17:10] it's all vanity
[1:17:12] and you find yourself fighting
[1:17:15] so when the when the pressure and the
[1:17:17] peer pressure is pulling on you to come
[1:17:19] one way
[1:17:20] Hallelujah
[1:17:21] and you happen to fight against the will
[1:17:23] of God and you're fighting over here oh
[1:17:26] it's a struggle to be torn in between
[1:17:29] two opinions
[1:17:30] it's a struggle when Satan's pulling on
[1:17:33] over you here and God's over here and
[1:17:36] you're here in the middle
[1:17:37] and you know you belong over here and
[1:17:39] you know the door is wide open but at
[1:17:41] the same time your will is wanting to
[1:17:45] come this way
[1:17:46] but I say denying oh God surrender that
[1:17:50] what Jesus had to come to that
[1:17:52] he said not not my will but thy will be
[1:17:57] done
[1:17:59] I want to please you I want that rest in
[1:18:02] you can you say man and Church of the
[1:18:05] Living God there remains a rest there
[1:18:10] remains a rest in 2023 there remains a
[1:18:16] rest for your soul
[1:18:19] [Applause]
[1:18:24] amen
[1:18:27] now
[1:18:28] Jesus says
[1:18:31] I'm come a light
[1:18:33] into the world
[1:18:35] that whosoever
[1:18:37] believeth on me
[1:18:40] should not abide
[1:18:42] in darkness
[1:18:44] that word abide is
[1:18:46] to continue without fading
[1:18:49] to continue without being lost
[1:18:52] that what abide means to live in
[1:18:54] to dwell to endure to remain permanent
[1:18:59] steadfast
[1:19:01] to abide is opposite of fade
[1:19:04] disappear
[1:19:05] short-lived
[1:19:08] to abide is the opposite of here today
[1:19:11] and going tomorrow to abide is the
[1:19:14] opposite of having Joy today and upset
[1:19:18] tomorrow Amen to abide is is is is
[1:19:22] opposite of starting
[1:19:24] in Christ and then over here and having
[1:19:28] the prophet say who hath Bewitched you
[1:19:31] foolish Galatians
[1:19:42] permanent place
[1:19:45] it's not a tent
[1:19:49] it's not here today and going tomorrow

[1:20:04] no turmoil around me there is nothing
[1:20:07] that is going to take me from that
[1:20:09] gentleness that sweetness that
[1:20:11] preciousness of the Holy Spirit I want
[1:20:14] to love I want to give I want to be
[1:20:18] everything that he is amen everything

[1:20:26] right to love I have a right to Joy I
[1:20:28] have a right to these things I'm living
[1:20:31] in it hey man come on can you see man
[1:20:37] it's no wonder
[1:20:40] that the command of God
[1:20:42] is to be ye steadfast
[1:20:48] how how
[1:20:50] could God expect that faith
[1:20:53] of us humans
[1:20:55] who are up and down and up and down and
[1:20:58] up how could God say
[1:21:00] Dee
[1:21:02] steadfast
[1:21:05] right because the labor is over
[1:21:09] you've been baptized into the logos
[1:21:13] himself do you realize that when you
[1:21:15] receive the logos or when you receive
[1:21:17] the Holy Ghost it is the very same
[1:21:19] spirit that was in Christ Jesus
[1:21:24] it's the life of the word in you Jesus
[1:21:27] the Apollo brother random said it he
[1:21:29] said you are baptized into that Lucas

[1:21:54] Divine Life In Need
[1:21:59] pulling his power through me
[1:22:01] conquering this flesh through me
[1:22:07] brother Branham says
[1:22:09] if I could get the world to see that
[1:22:12] why there you are
[1:22:14] it's the body of Christ Living standing
[1:22:18] redeemed
[1:22:19] redeemed whom I justified in the sight
[1:22:22] why are we Justified we are his victory
[1:22:26] the church is his victory we come forth
[1:22:29] in these last days with this glorious
[1:22:30] gospel showing his victory he died for
[1:22:35] it and we are the proof of his victory
[1:22:45] well that should make you want a shot

[1:23:09] in Chains of bitterness but he has come
[1:23:12] to give you the victory the lamb and the
[1:23:18] dove has come in one again
[1:23:24] brother Benham gives himself a big amen
[1:23:26] amen when we see him coming down and
[1:23:30] living among the church that's his
[1:23:31] victory it shows that he couldn't keep
[1:23:34] him in the grave and neither can they
[1:23:37] keep us
[1:23:39] we're already potentially raised because
[1:23:41] we've been raised from the dead unbelief
[1:23:43] in in in his word from denomination and
[1:23:47] Cree to the Eternal Word of the Eternal
[1:23:49] God which is himself working through US
[1:23:53] manifesting himself that he is the same
[1:23:56] yesterday today and forever can I hear
[1:24:00] an amen
[1:24:03] man they're stressed
[1:24:07] he said that's God's purpose
[1:24:10] his purpose has
[1:24:12] father Supreme
[1:24:13] was to be one with his family his
[1:24:15] Earthly family Adam and Eve
[1:24:17] and the only way they could be one
[1:24:19] with the family
[1:24:21] or with God was because God's nature was
[1:24:24] in him
[1:24:25] so that made them with God's nature in
[1:24:27] them and then with each other and God
[1:24:29] they'll become a one isn't it a
[1:24:32] beautiful picture God in his family
[1:24:34] father over all Supreme no death no
[1:24:36] sorrow no heartache no nothing just joy
[1:24:39] unspeakable never sick never have a
[1:24:41] heartache just one God what a picture
[1:24:44] because the very nature of God was in
[1:24:47] these people
[1:24:49] now he's given us the clear he's given
[1:24:51] us what made the difference now watch he
[1:24:53] says now
[1:24:55] and Jesus prayed in John 17 chapter 11
[1:24:59] verse
[1:25:00] you want to put the verse down for
[1:25:01] Sunday school's text I have many of them
[1:25:03] this morning but Saint John 17 11. Jesus
[1:25:06] prayed that the church and he would be
[1:25:10] one like he and the father were one
[1:25:13] that church that the church we as the
[1:25:17] members of his body of Christ would be
[1:25:19] one together just like he and the father
[1:25:22] are one at that day they will know that
[1:25:24] he was in the father or the father in
[1:25:26] him and he in us and that together we
[1:25:30] were one shout yes
[1:25:33] amen what a union a Oneness that would
[1:25:37] be uh to see God in his church till
[1:25:40] every member is just perfectly in
[1:25:43] harmony with each other and with God
[1:25:45] that's the church that Jesus is coming
[1:25:49] for
[1:25:53] oh yeah
[1:25:55] one
[1:25:57] not me here and God here
[1:26:01] and baptized into him
[1:26:04] we're one
[1:26:06] now he says now it's not that you're one
[1:26:09] as my finger
[1:26:11] Hallelujah and Jesus was not as one as
[1:26:14] your finger Jesus and God
[1:26:17] hallelujah praise the Lord
[1:26:20] I mean now the trinitarians have got
[1:26:24] God the Father
[1:26:27] God the son got the Holy Ghost
[1:26:29] Hallelujah
[1:26:31] claiming that the father was the father
[1:26:33] of Jesus that's how he got his name
[1:26:34] father
[1:26:35] but then of course when you read there
[1:26:37] in Matthew the first chapter the Bible
[1:26:39] says in two different places in that
[1:26:41] first chapter that he was that she that
[1:26:44] he was born of the Holy Ghost
[1:26:47] so now we've got two guys flirting with
[1:26:49] the same girl
[1:26:51] amen so we've got God the Father
[1:26:53] claiming to be the father and we got God
[1:26:56] the Holy Ghost claiming to be
[1:26:58] the father
[1:27:01] does that make sense to y'all
[1:27:04] so let's just go and get the third
[1:27:05] person out Hallelujah so now we've got
[1:27:08] God the Father
[1:27:10] amen the father God and we've got the
[1:27:13] son
[1:27:14] Jesus Christ
[1:27:16] and my scripture and my own scripture
[1:27:18] here
[1:27:19] father God and the son Jesus Christ
[1:27:23] that says that that's the way we believe
[1:27:24] it
[1:27:26] on that day on the on the Jordan River
[1:27:30] when God came down
[1:27:33] he is now living in the body
[1:27:38] he's now living in the body
[1:27:41] of Jesus
[1:27:45] one
[1:27:48] not one in a way that
[1:27:52] God died on Calvary
[1:27:56] God can't die
[1:27:59] Jesus says my father why hast Thou
[1:28:02] forsaken me
[1:28:04] the God had to leave that body so he
[1:28:07] could die a sinner's death for you
[1:28:14] come on now
[1:28:16] then he raised him up
[1:28:19] we'll praise the Lord
[1:28:21] the Apostle Paul says he is the image of
[1:28:24] the invisible God
[1:28:26] you'll never see God
[1:28:28] but you'll find his body
[1:28:31] come on now
[1:28:33] it pleased the father that in him should
[1:28:35] all the fullness dwell God created a
[1:28:40] body and he poured all of his glory in
[1:28:46] that body
[1:28:48] come on church he poured all of his
[1:28:51] glory in that body Oh Glory to God
[1:28:55] you'll never seek any other God than the
[1:28:59] God Jesus Christ
[1:29:02] hey
[1:29:03] because Christ
[1:29:05] Jesus and his body are now synonymous
[1:29:08] with God
[1:29:09] God will never leave that buddy
[1:29:15] but in this last day
[1:29:18] he's built himself a bride
[1:29:21] Hallelujah
[1:29:22] I wish I had me another cup Hallelujah
[1:29:26] and now here's his bride
[1:29:29] and he says I'm going to pour all of my
[1:29:33] glory
[1:29:34] inside that bride
[1:29:36] everything Christ is
[1:29:39] you will be
[1:29:41] in fact this is the bride coming of
[1:29:46] Jesus
[1:29:47] you don't see him you don't see him he's
[1:29:50] there he's there in the heavens that
[1:29:52] body is still there but that same Spirit
[1:29:55] Well glory to God
[1:30:07] Hallelujah
[1:30:09] now I'm just a member
[1:30:11] and you're just a member and you're just
[1:30:14] a member but together we all this is the
[1:30:17] reason why you have got to be baptized
[1:30:19] into him because you won't get along
[1:30:22] with each other without
[1:30:25] come on that's the reason why every
[1:30:28] family that's the reason why you married
[1:30:30] couples or are you you teenagers you
[1:30:33] better pick somebody with the Holy Ghost
[1:30:37] can you say man
[1:30:39] they'll never they'll never understand
[1:30:41] you
[1:30:44] but there's coming a reunion
[1:30:49] where that physical body
[1:30:52] is going to come
[1:30:54] and this body is going to meet him in
[1:30:56] the air
[1:31:00] come on
[1:31:07] oh come on all of that Glory all of his
[1:31:12] presence in you God is looking for a
[1:31:17] Oneness
[1:31:19] between you and him it must be his
[1:31:22] prayer was that you would be just as
[1:31:25] same in Oneness as he and God were the
[1:31:30] same in Oneness
[1:31:35] Jesus said it's my will it's not it's
[1:31:37] it's my meat to do the will of the
[1:31:40] father
[1:31:41] I do nothing except he foreshow me can
[1:31:44] you say Amen
[1:31:45] now brother Branham says the only
[1:31:47] grounds of Fellowship that God has ever
[1:31:50] laid down for himself in his church is
[1:31:51] the Oneness of himself and the people
[1:31:53] that's the only grounds of fellowship
[1:31:55] and the only way that you can ever come
[1:31:57] on you can have those grounds is by a
[1:31:58] union to be United with him forever and
[1:32:01] just like when you Unite with your
[1:32:02] husband the woman to unite with their
[1:32:04] husband it's a valentil death and now
[1:32:06] then when you Unite with God it's the
[1:32:08] same thing that the church United with
[1:32:10] Christ until death we part somebody
[1:32:13] shout hallelujah and then if you never
[1:32:16] sin or do anything wrong you're
[1:32:18] eternally United and he's talking about
[1:32:19] the willfully sinning there he goes on
[1:32:21] to share that we're going to have our
[1:32:22] ups and our Downs we're going to we're
[1:32:24] going to fail we're going to make a
[1:32:25] mistake but that's what the blood was
[1:32:26] for and only death can take you away
[1:32:30] from God not physical death but this the
[1:32:32] sin of death sin is death and that takes
[1:32:35] you away from God so to be United with
[1:32:37] him in the spirit of his power is
[1:32:40] eternal life
[1:32:42] you're eternally United with god oh I
[1:32:44] want that to I want to get to that after
[1:32:46] a while United eternally with eternal
[1:32:48] God and perfectly in harmony with him
[1:32:50] perfectly United together a church that
[1:32:52] all both God and his church is one
[1:32:54] United together
[1:32:59] we'll praise the Lord
[1:33:02] no he's going to share with us can I
[1:33:04] have a little more time
[1:33:05] he's going to share with us
[1:33:07] this was all a part of predestination
[1:33:12] he said just as Adam had both masculine
[1:33:17] and feminist spirit I know this is
[1:33:19] Elementary but I'm it but it's but it
[1:33:21] but it's good for what I'm saying here
[1:33:24] just as Adam and Eve
[1:33:27] were in Adam's spirit
[1:33:31] he was female and male
[1:33:33] can you say Amen
[1:33:36] Hallelujah not in body but in fact in in
[1:33:39] spirit
[1:33:42] then God separated it and put it in that
[1:33:45] body now brother Brandon would put it
[1:33:46] this way
[1:33:47] he says now notice Eve United with Adam
[1:33:49] Genesis 1 27 he created the male male
[1:33:52] and female the man male and female
[1:33:54] created them amen both male and female
[1:33:56] when it come to being Spirit the man was
[1:33:59] uh uh both male and female when it came
[1:34:02] to being in spirit a finished masculine
[1:34:04] then God took from the side a rib did
[1:34:07] you notice the body part was a byproduct
[1:34:08] but not the spirit the body part of the
[1:34:11] woman was a byproduct after the creation
[1:34:13] had been finished God took from the side
[1:34:15] of Adam a ribbon made the woman but not
[1:34:18] the spirit the spirit was part of the
[1:34:20] original well pray I I just want to
[1:34:22] shout right now the spirit was a part of
[1:34:25] Adam for he was both man and woman
[1:34:27] spiritually speaking but masculine and
[1:34:29] feminine don't you see the great picture
[1:34:32] we in flesh are different we're a
[1:34:35] byproduct we're created being by holy
[1:34:37] wedlock but in the spirit we are Sons
[1:34:39] and Daughters of God not some other
[1:34:41] Spirit but the spirit of the Living God
[1:34:43] we are in his likeness we are in his
[1:34:45] unity in the perfect image of the Living
[1:34:48] God because we become Sons and Daughters
[1:34:50] not separated but the Same Spirit the
[1:34:54] same God the same person joined in
[1:34:57] wedlock to the eternal
[1:35:00] see how God planned it to be
[1:35:03] not different
[1:35:06] not different
[1:35:11] some of you are wondering how
[1:35:13] can God pour all of him and then God
[1:35:16] then Christ pours himself
[1:35:18] in the air now we've got an empty body
[1:35:20] in the godhead and you were part of him
[1:35:23] the feminist side was taken from God and
[1:35:26] placed in a body same
[1:35:32] foreign
[1:35:36] thoughts come into you when you're
[1:35:39] baptized into that rest
[1:35:42] can you say Amen
[1:35:44] now

[1:35:48] a woman outside of the headship of her
[1:35:51] husband is in labor
[1:35:54] it's a struggle
[1:35:56] it's a struggle
[1:35:58] that sisters you're not supposed to
[1:35:59] struggle

[1:36:12] direction that he is leading you as a
[1:36:14] family

[1:36:21] girls don't get more or you you
[1:36:23] unmarried girls don't get married
[1:36:27] until you know a guy that you can love
[1:36:29] that you can respect
[1:36:32] because you're not supposed to labor
[1:36:34] he does all the laboring for you
[1:36:38] you say well around our house I can die

[1:36:43] stove and I have to label oh but listen

[1:36:48] taking care of all of the hard stuff and
[1:36:49] you're just taking care of making him

[1:36:55] giving him rest
[1:36:57] his responsibility
[1:36:59] take care of you
[1:37:01] that's his responsibility
[1:37:04] come on
[1:37:05] and you men should never be looking at
[1:37:07] you why I live in all this
[1:37:10] all this you fat thing
[1:37:14] you
[1:37:15] you have called you have chosen her to

[1:37:23] together masculine and feminine
[1:37:27] and together
[1:37:28] you're walking and conquering
[1:37:31] can you say that
[1:37:34] ain't no fat girls in the church amen so
[1:37:36] y'all quit looking at you waiting amen
[1:37:38] somebody's saying who was he talking to
[1:37:40] right
[1:37:43] I will go on preaching Hallelujah
[1:37:46] now he said see how God planned it that
[1:37:51] we should be not a different but him not
[1:37:56] some other being of some other tribe but
[1:38:00] a real Union an offspring of the
[1:38:02] almighty done by a holy Union and the
[1:38:04] body comes from father and mother but
[1:38:06] the spirit come from God God separating
[1:38:09] himself as Adam was created somebody
[1:38:13] shout hallelujah
[1:38:15] yes
[1:38:17] there's no more labor
[1:38:21] he's provided it
[1:38:25] then he goes on and tells us how it came
[1:38:27] from here to here he says on the day of
[1:38:30] Pentecost we find the Holy Spirit the
[1:38:33] pillar of fire separating itself and
[1:38:35] setting upon each of them remember
[1:38:36] remember the great Pillar of Fire came
[1:38:39] down upon him
[1:38:41] in him dwelt the fullness of all the
[1:38:44] godhead masculine and feminine
[1:38:49] in him was the fullness of the godhead
[1:38:53] masculine and feminine demon did not did
[1:38:56] did not Jesus say is it not written in
[1:38:59] your laws where I said ye are gods
[1:39:02] he was talking about there in in Psalms
[1:39:06] your Gods but you die like men
[1:39:09] can you say Amen
[1:39:10] separating itself and setting up with
[1:39:13] each of the member of the church God
[1:39:14] here we go somebody punch your neighbor
[1:39:17] and tell them this is going to get good
[1:39:18] right here
[1:39:19] God putting himself together
[1:39:24] then when that group of people together
[1:39:26] what does it do it brings back the
[1:39:28] unified body of the Lord Jesus
[1:39:32] joined in Heavenly wedlock
[1:39:35] to the Eternal God
[1:39:37] well if you ain't going to shout I am

[1:40:02] believe God regardless
[1:40:06] let this be the year of rest
[1:40:12] amen
[1:40:14] brother random says no there's one thing
[1:40:15] the Tabernacle needs up there at our
[1:40:18] church
[1:40:18] at the Tabernacle of Jeff is a
[1:40:20] rededication and refilling of the Holy
[1:40:22] Ghost that's right everyone to get down
[1:40:24] to the Altar and pray until we get a
[1:40:27] renewing of the Holy Ghost the holy the
[1:40:29] whole church be filled with the power of
[1:40:31] God that's what we need not only the
[1:40:34] Tabernacle there but the body of Christ
[1:40:35] Universal it needs a refilling David
[1:40:38] said one day restore to be the joy of my
[1:40:41] salvation now he had not lost his
[1:40:44] salvation but the joy of it and when it
[1:40:47] come to a place that when I can't enjoy
[1:40:49] my religion my salvation there's
[1:40:51] something wrong somewhere because it is
[1:40:53] joy unspeakable and full of Glory one of
[1:40:56] them said taste and see that the Lord is
[1:40:58] good it tastes like Honey in the Rock oh
[1:41:02] I'm so glad that I've tasted that the
[1:41:05] Lord is good I love honey but I've never
[1:41:08] tasted any like that that's the best
[1:41:11] that I know
[1:41:14] Hallelujah
[1:41:16] hallelujah oh glory to God aren't you
[1:41:19] glad that you're living in this world of
[1:41:21] perversion you're living in this world

[1:41:27] alone
[1:41:28] with you and God
[1:41:30] amen
[1:41:32] amen
[1:41:33] another place brother random says the
[1:41:34] holy spirit is here if you've Fallen
[1:41:36] weak and lukewarm in your experience and
[1:41:39] you'd like to be renewed Again David
[1:41:41] said restore to me the joy of my
[1:41:44] salvation he had not lost to Salvation
[1:41:46] but he lost the joy
[1:41:49] and I think that goes to about 95
[1:41:52] percent of the church today
[1:41:55] another place he says in order to stay
[1:41:57] with God
[1:41:59] stay gentle
[1:42:01] God is gentle in order to stay with God
[1:42:05] stay with love
[1:42:07] God is love
[1:42:09] stay meek
[1:42:11] never be self-sufficient always rely
[1:42:14] upon him never use your own mind take
[1:42:16] his thoughts let his thoughts be your
[1:42:20] thoughts hey
[1:42:24] man are you seeing where rest comes
[1:42:28] from Oneness
[1:42:31] rest
[1:42:32] Jesus could give rest because he was at
[1:42:36] one with the father
[1:42:38] you can fulfill your purpose here on
[1:42:42] this Earth
[1:42:43] and when the world doesn't understand it

[1:48:08] sins will not Prosper covers his sins
[1:48:11] but he that will confess his sins
[1:48:13] there's where you get the freedom and
[1:48:15] the justification is when you're willing
[1:48:18] to say I've sinned I'm wrong and that's
[1:48:21] what you've just said here I've fallen
[1:48:24] I've sinned I'm dead wrong is there a
[1:48:27] chance for me to be whole again and
[1:48:28] brother random said absolutely the

[1:49:02] right yes laying on of hands is a great
[1:49:05] thing I believe in it I believe in the
[1:49:08] laying on of hands I sure do but that
[1:49:09] isn't what does it I could lay hands on
[1:49:11] people week in and week out and still it
[1:49:14] would do no but until you accept it
[1:49:18] what Christ did
[1:49:20] for you
[1:49:22] can you say man
[1:49:25] if my words
[1:49:26] if you abide in me
[1:49:30] and my words
[1:49:31] abide in you
[1:49:33] how are those words going to abide in
[1:49:35] you that's when the logos himself comes
[1:49:38] down and lives in you

[1:49:55] brother Branham says if there's ever
[1:49:57] been an age that should be zealous to
[1:49:59] repent repent it's this age
[1:50:02] he says if there's ever an age
[1:50:04] that you'd expect the supernatural
[1:50:07] it should be this age
[1:50:09] you know why oh because in the evening
[1:50:12] time it shall be light
[1:50:15] rest
[1:50:17] is come to the elect of God
[1:50:21] we've been shown who we are who he is
[1:50:25] and we're standing upon it
[1:50:29] it's when we can come
[1:50:32] how long have I been amen
[1:50:36] boy I've gotten long-winded
[1:50:39] amen
[1:50:43] it's when we can come to the reality
[1:50:48] and look in the mirror of that word
[1:50:50] and as we're walking up as that boy
[1:50:52] walking up to that mirror never seen
[1:50:54] that mirror before never seen never seen
[1:50:57] nothing like this any waves and it waves
[1:50:59] back and he gets closer and Mama she's
[1:51:02] back behind in there watching
[1:51:04] and he's he's given enough and then he
[1:51:07] goes up and he touches it
[1:51:10] and he turns around to his mom and he
[1:51:12] says
[1:51:12] that's me
[1:51:15] that's me
[1:51:19] and we blunt oh we've always looked
[1:51:21] we've always we've looked Hallelujah
[1:51:25] stay
[1:51:27] and we've looked and we thought oh oh
[1:51:29] man there's something about that word
[1:51:34] could it be
[1:51:36] there's something oh wow oh it's just
[1:51:40] attracting me it's
[1:51:42] huh
[1:51:44] hey papa
[1:51:45] that's me
[1:51:47] [Applause]
[1:51:51] I'm part of the eternals
[1:51:53] that's who I am
[1:51:55] and if you are at one with God then you
[1:51:59] can ask what you will and it shall be
[1:52:03] done for it's not you and then him it is
[1:52:07] you in him
[1:52:09] [Applause]
[1:52:12] he says ye and me and I in you that they
[1:52:15] may be one father even as you and I are
[1:52:17] one God in Christ Christ in the church
[1:52:19] just as we are one so so they be one
[1:52:23] then how can you be one if you abide in
[1:52:26] me and my words abide in you my words in
[1:52:29] you then ask what you will it isn't you
[1:52:32] no more it's the word that's in you and
[1:52:35] the word is God can I hear an amen
[1:52:41] good it's a rest yes
[1:52:43] he says the word of God is a sword
[1:52:46] Hebrews the fourth chapter says
[1:52:48] amen
[1:52:50] for 12 he's known as a sword sword is
[1:52:53] perfectly dormant if it is yielded by if
[1:52:55] it isn't yielded by a hand or power but
[1:52:57] it takes a hand to hold the Sword and
[1:52:59] the hand that holds this sword is the
[1:53:01] hand of faith
[1:53:02] you can't have faith in condemnation
[1:53:04] you can't be you can't you can't be
[1:53:06] resting
[1:53:08] and laboring at the same time
[1:53:10] you've got to come into this rest
[1:53:12] and the Hand of faith it depends on how
[1:53:14] strong it is the hand of Faith might be
[1:53:17] just strong enough to cut a little hole
[1:53:18] through the darkness and save by faith
[1:53:20] I'm saved that's a great cut but then if
[1:53:22] that's all the stronger the hand is to
[1:53:23] yield that sword that's all it can cut
[1:53:25] but if it's a strong man it'll cut
[1:53:28] through everything the devil can put out
[1:53:31] there and make every promise of God
[1:53:33] shine forth in the power of his
[1:53:35] resurrection if it's a strong hand of
[1:53:37] Faith the days of Miracles Jesus Christ
[1:53:39] the same yesterday today and forever
[1:53:40] it'll cut its way through it depends on
[1:53:43] the power of the hand behind the sword
[1:53:46] amen
[1:53:48] now I'm talking to you
[1:53:50] we know what this world will do
[1:53:54] we know this is right can I hear an amen
[1:53:57] but now he's saying
[1:53:58] if it ain't working
[1:54:04] it's the hand
[1:54:07] and the Hand can't have faith
[1:54:10] it's not walking with God
[1:54:14] you gotta walk with him on the job in
[1:54:17] the home
[1:54:18] in school
[1:54:20] can you say man
[1:54:22] are you hearing me
[1:54:24] when you watch
[1:54:26] he says now the sword is plenty Sharp

[1:54:34] just love it I just love it if you've
[1:54:36] got

[1:54:49] the the chosen seed of God

[1:54:55] coming up saying I can do this

[1:55:00] but I'm not talking about
[1:55:02] I'm not talking about the ox gold of

[1:55:34] sword and he said well maybe maybe I'm
[1:55:36] supposed to Knight preachers or

[1:58:20] rest
[1:58:23] he says the Christian faith is based
[1:58:25] Softly
[1:58:30] a Christian is not tossed about
[1:58:33] a Christian doesn't run from place to
[1:58:35] place
[1:58:36] a Christian doesn't fuss and few
[1:58:39] Christian doesn't worry
[1:58:42] about things a Christian rest it's all
[1:58:45] over it's all finished for the believer
[1:58:47] at Calvary
[1:58:49] that's right
[1:58:51] sickness May comes and disappointments
[1:58:54] but the Christian at but the Christians
[1:58:57] at rest knowing this that God is able to
[1:58:59] keep that which he has performed
[1:59:03] knowing that no matter what the thing is
[1:59:06] how it looks there's neither sickness
[1:59:09] sorrow death there's neither starvation
[1:59:11] or anything can separate us from the
[1:59:13] love of God that's in Christ Jesus
[1:59:16] we're at rest
[1:59:18] Just Let The Old Ship tossed any way he
[1:59:21] wants she wants
[1:59:23] her holds
[1:59:32] Let It Go however it wants the anchor
[1:59:35] hosts
[1:59:37] let the enemy do what he wants
[1:59:40] The Anchor Holds
[1:59:42] oh come on church I just want to tell
[1:59:45] you we have an anchor of the Soul here
[1:59:47] tonight I'm talking about a genuine rest
[1:59:52] hallelujah it's a rest it's a rest
[1:59:56] hey man
[1:59:58] amen
[2:00:00] you talked about that he says it's seen
[2:00:03] I came to an arbor one time the big old
[2:00:05] ship was there and
[2:00:06] he said the sales had been let down you
[2:00:09] know and the storm on the sea mine she
[2:00:11] was a toss and I sing that Old Ship
[2:00:13] there rocking back and forth waves would
[2:00:15] go in some ways would go under and
[2:00:18] everything and I said wonder why that is
[2:00:20] the fella standing there said it's got a
[2:00:22] sea anchor on it
[2:00:24] therefore the ship can't sink
[2:00:27] it can go through the waves but it can't
[2:00:28] sink because it's anchored and I said oh
[2:00:31] praise be to God we got an anchor
[2:00:34] some ways can go over some we can go
[2:00:37] under
[2:00:38] but regardless if the anchor holds it
[2:00:41] isn't the ship doing the holding it's
[2:00:42] the anchor doing the holding
[2:00:44] it isn't what I am or what I will be or
[2:00:47] what I was it's what he is right now and
[2:00:50] what he did for me and you it can't it
[2:00:53] ain't what I can do it's what he has
[2:00:55] done
[2:00:56] Faith doesn't anchor in what's coming
[2:00:59] meetings my faith doesn't rest and in
[2:01:02] the ability that I would have or upon
[2:01:04] the church that I should join or what
[2:01:06] people I should associate my faith
[2:01:08] anchors and rest entirely from the
[2:01:10] finished work of the Lord Jesus Christ
[2:01:12] can you say Amen do you love him
[2:01:16] rest
[2:01:18] oh let this year be the year of rest
[2:01:24] and in resting
[2:01:26] then you do a greater work for God
[2:01:29] because you're ceasing from your own
[2:01:31] laborers
[2:01:33] and now your mind is entered into him
[2:01:36] now
[2:01:37] you can sort of see how the devil's
[2:01:39] trying
[2:01:41] the devil's trying to pull you off of
[2:01:43] your
[2:01:45] your throne Queen Esther
[2:01:47] trying to pull you away from
[2:01:51] it's your time dress yourself in
[2:01:53] humility
[2:01:55] clothe yourself in royalty
[2:01:58] flow with yourself in peace
[2:02:00] come before God
[2:02:03] and being the gentle Little Queen in
[2:02:06] humbleness before the key
[2:02:09] you'll find that all of Heaven
[2:02:12] is at your disposal
[2:02:15] you're going to save a great big nation
[2:02:19] because you've come to the kingdom for
[2:02:23] such a time as this can you say man
[2:02:26] not my will not my my but let my let thy
[2:02:30] will be done in me
[2:02:32] Use Me Lord
[2:02:34] Let Your Presence flow through me
[2:02:38] how about it
[2:02:40] I know you've probably already
[2:02:41] rededicated your life
[2:02:44] and maybe some of you it's already been
[2:02:46] like a New Year's resolution it's
[2:02:48] already went out the door
[2:02:50] I'm here to tell you
[2:02:52] there's a place
[2:02:54] if there's someone here that doesn't
[2:02:55] have the Holy Ghost
[2:02:58] and you're wanting to cease from your
[2:02:59] own labors
[2:03:01] oh why don't you come into Jesus tonight
[2:03:04] if there's some of you
[2:03:06] that have the Holy Ghost
[2:03:08] but you've let the devil wander you away
[2:03:11] from that rest
[2:03:13] once you come back to him tonight
[2:03:18] he loves you tonight
[2:03:20] can you say man
[2:03:21] oh we're going home

[2:03:34] three seconds to midnight
[2:03:35] [Music]
[2:03:36] foreign
[2:03:39] reporters and everyone all making fun of
[2:03:41] that
[2:03:46] there's nothing science about that clock

[2:03:50] people
[2:03:51] fearful
[2:03:52] I believe the clock
[2:03:56] I believe we're three seconds to
[2:03:57] midnight
[2:03:59] I believe that there is a bomb that
[2:04:02] Russia has for the United States
[2:04:06] I believe that the United States is
[2:04:08] going to be in craters
[2:04:12] I also believe
[2:04:14] in the promise that says before one bomb
[2:04:17] drops
[2:04:18] you'll be in glory
[2:04:21] I'm resting upon that
[2:04:24] I'm resting upon that
[2:04:26] make sure you're in Christ I don't care
[2:04:29] I don't care I I was I was I was at a at
[2:04:33] a meeting here a while back preaching
[2:04:35] the spirit of the Lord was moving strong
