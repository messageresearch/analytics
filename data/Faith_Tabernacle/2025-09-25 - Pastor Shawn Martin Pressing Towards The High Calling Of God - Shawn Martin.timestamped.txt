[20:42] see me through.
[20:46] [Music]
[20:47] For he is the way, the truth, and life.
[20:56] And when I'm faced with storms of life
[21:03] and I don't know what to do,
[21:08] [Music]
[21:10] I whisper Jesus
[21:14] and he'll always see me through.
[21:19] [Music]
[21:21] And I know
[21:24] how it feels
[21:27] to be alone.
[21:29] [Music]
[21:32] And I've gone
[21:35] many days
[21:37] without a song.
[21:43] When all hope seemed gone
[21:48] and I could not carry on, I whispered,
[21:54] "Jesus,
[21:56] and you'll always see me through.
[22:02] He'll see me through
[22:07] my darkest days and lonely nights. He'll
[22:13] see me through.
[22:18] For he is the way, the truth, and life.
[22:26] And when I'm faced with storms of life
[22:32] and I don't know what to do,
[22:38] [Music]

[22:43] and you'll always see me through.
[22:49] [Music]
[23:01] And he made
[23:04] a way where there was no way.
[23:11] He's my light
[23:14] and he shines
[23:17] all the day.
[23:22] I'll not fear the valleys
[23:27] for I know he'll make a way. He's always
[23:33] there
[23:35] and he'll always see me through.
[23:40] [Music]
[23:41] He'll see me through
[23:47] my darkest days and lonely nights. He'll
[23:53] see me through.
[23:57] For he is the way, the truth, and life.
[24:05] And when I'm faced with storms of life
[24:11] and I don't know what to do,
[24:16] [Music]
[24:18] I whisper Jesus
[24:21] and you'll always see me through.
[24:28] And when I'm faced with storms of life
[24:34] and I don't know what to do,
[24:41] I'll whisper Jesus
[24:44] and he'll always see me through.
[24:52] [Music]
[25:00] Amen. Can we stand to our feet as we
[25:02] invite our pastor to come?

[26:47] Amen. Are you going all the way?
[26:50] Amen. There's an old song
[26:53] uh if we can maybe pull it up. Just a
[26:56] little while. Do you know that song?
[26:58] Just a little while to labor. Just a
[27:01] little while to

[27:19] [Music]
[27:24] We're straight.
[27:27] Oh, just a little more of trouble
[27:33] in this low and simple stay.
[27:38] In the inner heavens
[27:41] for most
[27:45] early days,
[27:49] soon this life will all be over
[27:54] and all pilgrimage will end.
[28:00] Soon we'll take our heavenly journey.
[28:05] Be at home again with friends.
[28:10] Oh, heaven's gates were standing open,
[28:16] waiting for our entrance there.

[28:42] Just a little while to labor
[28:48] in the path that's always straight.
[28:53] Just a little more of trouble
[28:57] [Music]
[28:58] in this and sinful state.
[29:04] Then we'll enter heaven's portals
[29:09] sweeping through the pearly gates.
[29:13] Now soon'll see the light of morning.
[29:19] Then the new day will begin.

[29:51] and we'll live with heaven. Well, won't
[29:54] there be a time? Well, a little while to
[29:59] stay here. Just a little while to wait.
[30:07] Just a little while to labor
[30:12] in the path that's always straight.
[30:17] Just a little while of trouble
[30:22] in this low and sinful stain.

[30:33] sweeping through.
[30:35] [Music]
[30:36] Amen. Now soon we'll meet again our
[30:41] loved ones. Then we'll take them by the
[30:46] hand.

[30:54] over in the promised land.
[30:59] Then we'll be at home forever
[31:04] throughout all eternity.

[31:35] in the path that's always straight.
[31:40] Just a little more of trouble
[31:45] in this low and sinful state.
[31:51] Then we'll enter heaven's portals
[31:56] sweeping through the pearly gates. Last
[31:59] lines. All them will enter heaven's
[32:04] mortals

[32:14] praise?
[32:16] Hallelujah.
[32:19] Blessed be the name of the Lord.

[32:24] time?
[32:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. I trust you are. Amen. Uh it it
[32:29] ain't going to be too much longer.
[32:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. The musicians can be
[32:34] dismissed. Amen. If you have your
[32:36] Bibles, we're going to turn to
[32:38] Philippians 3:8. If you can turn these
[32:40] monitors up, that'd be great. And then
[32:44] it's good to have uh brother Josiah and
[32:47] sister Mindy, amen, with us. Amen. And
[32:51] the children. Praise the Lord. And um
[32:55] trust they had a wonderful time.
[32:58] Amen. Um in in their services and they
[33:03] went on to Ohio and spent time with his
[33:06] family. And so um glad they made it
[33:10] back. Praise the Lord. Uh before we go
[33:13] into the word, may we just bow our heads
[33:16] and talk to our Lord. Father,
[33:21] we are sure longing for home
[33:25] and we realize by the signs of time
[33:29] that it ain't going to be too much
[33:30] longer.
[33:32] And Lord, we want to do all that we can
[33:36] on this side, Father. And we want to
[33:39] labor. We want to give everything that
[33:42] we've got, Father, to your kingdom.
[33:47] And Lord, as we are gathered here
[33:49] tonight, I just pray that you would come
[33:52] and just strengthen your people. Father,
[33:55] you know, every need that is present,
[33:57] whether it be sickness, discouragement,
[34:00] or if it's just needing to come up
[34:02] higher, needing more understanding of
[34:05] your word, whatever it would be, you
[34:08] hold the key to it all.
[34:10] And Father, as we humble our hearts,
[34:12] Lord, to you tonight and just welcome
[34:15] you and ask that you would just go walk
[34:18] the aisles, walk every pew, and Father,
[34:22] touch every heart, anoint both speaker
[34:25] and hearer. And I pray that you would
[34:28] just anoint these lips of clay. And
[34:31] Father, that you would just speak what
[34:32] words you would have to say. We ask it
[34:35] in Jesus Christ's name.
[34:37] &gt;&gt; Jesus.
[34:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. And amen.
[34:41] So, we want to turn to Philippians 3:8
[34:45] and we'll start there.
[34:48] Actually, we'll go uh the seventh verse.
[34:52] But what things were gained to me, those
[34:54] I counted loss for Christ.
[34:57] Yay, doubtless I count all things but
[35:00] loss, for the excellency of the
[35:01] knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord, for
[35:04] whom I have suffered the loss of all
[35:06] things, and do count them but dung, that
[35:08] I may win Christ,
[35:11] and be found in him, not having my own
[35:13] righteousness, which is of the law, but
[35:15] that which is through the faith of
[35:17] Christ, the righteousness which is of
[35:19] God by faith,
[35:21] that I may know him and the power of his
[35:24] resurrection, and the fellowship of his
[35:27] sufferings. ings being made conformable
[35:29] unto his death, if by any means I might
[35:33] attain unto the resurrection of the
[35:34] dead, not as though I'd already
[35:37] attained, either were already perfect,
[35:39] but I follow after.
[35:42] I want you to notice that I I follow
[35:44] after if that I may apprehend that for
[35:47] which also I am apprehended of Christ
[35:50] Jesus.
[35:52] Brethren, I count not myself to have
[35:54] apprehended, but this one thing I do,
[35:57] and this is where I want to go to uh
[35:59] talk about is forgetting those things
[36:02] which are behind and reaching forth unto
[36:05] those things which are before.
[36:08] &gt;&gt; I press toward the mark for the prize of
[36:11] the high calling of God in Christ Jesus.
[36:15] &gt;&gt; You can have your seats this evening.
[36:18] And if I were to title it, it would be
[36:22] pressing towards the high calling of
[36:24] God.
[36:26] And um you know, the the Christian life
[36:29] is the best life there is
[36:34] u outside of any life. You you could you
[36:37] could choose uh a rich life or um um a
[36:42] life of whatever, but uh the Christian
[36:44] life is the best to live. But but it's
[36:48] not an easy life to live. It's the best
[36:50] life to live, but it's not an easy life.
[36:54] &gt;&gt; And the prophet tells us, he says, "Now
[36:57] I'm I'm telling you, when as soon as you
[37:00] say you got the Holy Ghost, Satan's got
[37:03] every gun right on you shooting you."
[37:07] &gt;&gt; Another place he says, "Every man and
[37:09] woman, as soon as you're baptized with
[37:11] the Holy Ghost, immediately the devil
[37:14] sets in from every side. And if he
[37:16] didn't, then you better go back. So, so
[37:20] and and there's a lot more things that
[37:22] Brother Brandham talks about of how that
[37:26] uh uh really we're we're in a warfare.
[37:29] And so, this is why we are told in the
[37:32] scriptures to put on the whole armor of
[37:35] God.
[37:36] &gt;&gt; And and you must put on we are to take
[37:38] the shield of faith. We are to take the
[37:41] sword of the spirit. We are to put on
[37:44] the the breastplate of righteousness.
[37:46] And brother Bram said, then you pull up
[37:48] the kinch on it and tighten yourself up
[37:51] a little bit and get ready for it cuz
[37:53] it's a coming.
[37:55] &gt;&gt; Don't you worry. You're going to have
[37:57] plenty of trouble.
[37:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, don't worry about that. You're
[38:01] going to have it, right?
[38:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. But then he goes on to say, "But
[38:05] we're not to worry uh about it because
[38:08] greater is he that is in us than he that
[38:12] is in the world." Ain't that right?
[38:14] &gt;&gt; So then we're not a stranger to
[38:16] afflictions. We're not a stranger to
[38:18] things that uh that come our way. It's
[38:20] just it's if if you've chose to be a
[38:23] Christian for the good things, uh there
[38:26] there are promises and there are these
[38:29] things, but don't think you to yourself
[38:31] to be deceived. uh uh in thinking that
[38:34] there's not any trouble because there is
[38:37] trouble. Now I want to deal with the two
[38:40] things uh statements that Paul makes uh
[38:43] in our opening scripture. First of all,
[38:46] forgetting those things that are behind
[38:49] and then pressing towards the high
[38:51] calling of God. Forgetting those things
[38:54] that are behind and pressing towards the
[38:56] high calling of God. So if you have
[39:00] served God at any length of time, you
[39:04] know that what he is saying is not easy.
[39:07] It's not easy to forget those things
[39:09] that are behind and it's not easy to
[39:13] reach forward those things that are
[39:15] before.
[39:16] &gt;&gt; True.
[39:16] &gt;&gt; And yet Paul is saying this is what I'm
[39:19] doing. And it wasn't just a statement
[39:22] for himself, but he was showing that
[39:24] every believer uh uh uh must come to
[39:28] this forgetting those things that are
[39:30] behind and pressing towards the high
[39:33] calling of God.
[39:35] &gt;&gt; And so the reason is is as long the
[39:38] prophet said, as long as you're in this
[39:41] life, this is why it's not easy. He
[39:44] said, "As long as you're in this life,
[39:45] you're going to be sticky and have a
[39:48] carnal nature that's going to bother you
[39:50] as long as you live.
[39:53] &gt;&gt; But the inside of you, you're born
[39:55] again." Ain't that right?
[39:56] &gt;&gt; So, just because we're we're filled with
[39:58] the Holy Ghost doesn't mean that it
[40:00] takes away the troubles. It and and and
[40:02] the issues. And our troubles come not
[40:05] from the soul, but our troubles come by
[40:08] our flesh. This old sticky nature. Ain't
[40:11] that right, the Holy Ghost? Um, our soul
[40:14] has already been sealed. If you've got
[40:15] the baptism of the Holy Ghost, your soul
[40:18] is sealed. And until the day of your
[40:20] redemption, Amen. But your sticky
[40:23] nature, that that carnal nature is
[40:25] what's going to bother you as long as
[40:27] you live. Amen. And so, Brother Brandham
[40:30] made that statement as he was trying to
[40:33] explain or as he was explaining uh what
[40:37] Paul said in in uh uh uh the seventh
[40:40] chapter of Romans. and and uh I'm not
[40:44] going to read it uh to save time, but
[40:46] you ought to go back and read it and and
[40:48] compare with what brother Brandham said
[40:50] about it. And and Paul wasn't talking
[40:52] about sinners uh uh uh as some would
[40:56] have you to believe, but Paul was
[40:58] actually talking about Holy Ghost
[41:00] fililled people that struggle that that
[41:04] have things that they deal with. And so,
[41:08] uh, again, even though we have the Holy
[41:10] Ghost, we're going to struggle with our
[41:12] fleshly nature.
[41:14] &gt;&gt; But, but the prophet said we are to
[41:17] bring our our, uh, body under subjection
[41:22] to the word of God by faith in the word
[41:25] of God. So, so it's it's it's not that
[41:29] we just allow these struggles to
[41:31] overcome us, but but we are by the
[41:35] authority of God. Amen. Able to take uh
[41:39] and bring this flesh and and subdue it.
[41:43] Amen. Overcome. Can you say amen? See,
[41:47] bring our feelings under subjection.
[41:50] Bring our emotions under subjection.
[41:54] bring our uh symptoms and the the
[41:57] fleshly desires under subjection to the
[42:01] word of God by faith in the word of God.
[42:04] In other words, if if if we cannot
[42:07] believe the word of God, if we have not
[42:09] faith in the word of God, if we're
[42:11] questioning the word of God, there's
[42:13] absolutely no way that we can bring
[42:15] these things uh under subjection to the
[42:18] word of God because the prophet said we
[42:20] bring this our body under subjection to
[42:23] the word by faith in the word.
[42:26] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? And so, uh all of
[42:28] these things are to be brought under
[42:31] subjection to the word of God. Now here
[42:34] Paul would say leaving the past behind.
[42:38] And and so uh the way to leave the past,
[42:41] how many wants to leave the past behind?
[42:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's what the duty of a
[42:45] Christian, that's what a believer is, is
[42:48] to leave the past behind. Amen. And and
[42:51] to do that, Amen. is to forget the past.
[42:56] Ain't that right? To leave the past is
[42:58] to forget the past. Amen. And and the
[43:02] word forget, it means to lose the
[43:05] remembrance of, be unable to think of or
[43:09] recall, to disregard intentionally,
[43:14] to overlook, to cease remembering or
[43:17] noticing. Ain't that right?
[43:18] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[43:19] &gt;&gt; So, this is what Paul was was saying to
[43:22] the church.
[43:25] I'm going to forget the past.
[43:27] &gt;&gt; I'm going to leave those the past
[43:29] behind.
[43:31] And I'm I'm going to forget it. I'm I'm
[43:33] I'm going to intentionally disregard
[43:36] everything that was. Now, as as the year
[43:40] of 1961 was approaching, brother
[43:43] Brandham said, there's just one thing
[43:45] that I would like to say, and that is
[43:47] like the Apostle Paul said, forgetting
[43:50] those things that are in the past, all
[43:52] my mistakes and all the things that I
[43:55] have done, I press toward the mark of
[43:58] the high calling in Christ. That's the
[44:01] only regrets that I have is my heirs for
[44:03] the past and and the past part of my
[44:06] life. And I can only humbly ask him for
[44:09] grace to press on towards the mark of
[44:12] the high calling. Can you say amen?
[44:14] &gt;&gt; So, so these are things that he tells us
[44:16] that we need to forget. Amen. A year
[44:18] later, as 1963 was approaching, he said,
[44:22] "Forgetting those things that are in the
[44:24] past, all of our mistakes of last year,
[44:26] I press towards the mark of the high
[44:29] calling. All my mistakes that I've made
[44:32] in all these years, forgive me for them.
[44:34] God, forgive me. Church, forgive me the
[44:37] the ministry I failed with. I I feel
[44:40] God, forgive me for it. See, church,
[44:43] forgive me of my mistakes. I and I'll
[44:46] press towards the mark of the high
[44:48] calling in Christ Jesus. As 1964 was
[44:53] approaching, Brother Brandham said,
[44:54] "Today, as we face new years, I want to
[44:57] think not uh of not like the past, but I
[45:01] want to look to the future."
[45:04] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? So when when we're
[45:06] we're forgetting the things behind you,
[45:09] you you you can't keep dwelling on the
[45:11] past. You've got to look to the future.
[45:14] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? How many believes
[45:16] there's a future?
[45:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. Believers. Amen. We We ain't just
[45:20] got a past. We've got a future.
[45:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. And and and dwelling on the past
[45:25] and looking to the future. You can't do
[45:27] that. You've got to leave the past
[45:29] behind. Forget the past and look to the
[45:33] future. A ain't that right? So he says,
[45:36] "Now I want to look think of not not
[45:38] like the past, but I want to look to the
[45:41] future." We are looking what we have
[45:43] past when we're looking in the rearview
[45:46] mirror. See, so we're not Christians
[45:48] that look in the rearview mirror. Amen.
[45:51] Looking at the past, he said, "See,
[45:53] we're we're not trying to place the
[45:56] message today as looking through a
[45:58] rearview mirror. Don't Don't take the
[46:00] message while you're looking through a
[46:02] rear view mirror. Can you say amen? This
[46:05] message isn't just speaking of our past.
[46:07] It's it's actually wiping our past
[46:09] clean. It's it's it's telling us of our
[46:12] future. And and the message doesn't help
[46:15] us as long as we're constantly looking
[46:18] in the rearview mirror at our past. So
[46:21] he says when we're, you know, uh we're
[46:23] not trying to place the message today as
[46:25] looking through a rearview mirror. It
[46:27] would take too long. The things that the
[46:29] Lord has did and you are all acquainted
[46:32] with the great things that the Lord has
[46:33] been doing is some of the mightiest
[46:35] things that I've ever seen in my life.
[46:37] He's just passing in the last few
[46:38] months. But now we are thankful for what
[46:41] we what has been. But now we're looking
[46:44] forward. We're looking forward where
[46:48] we're headed.
[46:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[46:51] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[46:53] &gt;&gt; We we're we're going somewhere. How many
[46:55] believes that? we're we're going
[46:58] somewhere.
[46:59] &gt;&gt; See, and so the the prophet would tell
[47:02] us that that uh uh to never look back to
[47:06] what was or what has happened in the
[47:09] past.
[47:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. Don't don't look in the rearview
[47:12] mirror cuz when you do that, you're
[47:15] looking at what was and and we're to
[47:17] never do that. Never look back to the
[47:20] old life.
[47:22] &gt;&gt; Never look back to old ways. Never look
[47:25] back to past experiences.
[47:28] Can you say amen? The prophet said,
[47:30] "Leaving the world behind, leaving
[47:33] theology behind. I see Christ in him
[47:37] only." Well, where is Christ? Not behind
[47:40] you. Christ is before you.
[47:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:44] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? See? And so therefore,
[47:47] forgetting for everybody say,
[47:49] "Forgetting
[47:51] means not letting things bother you."
[47:55] &gt;&gt; Forgetting
[47:57] means not letting things bother you.
[47:59] Billy Brand said, "They may say, "Hey,
[48:01] you know, Billy Brandham's a holy
[48:02] roller. I don't even hear it. I just
[48:06] keep on tramping on." That's right. I'm
[48:08] pressing towards the mark of the high
[48:11] calling yonder. say, "You know, I
[48:13] believe that guy's a medium." Well, that
[48:16] don't bother me a bit. See, I just keep
[48:19] moving on. He's telling us how we move
[48:21] on.
[48:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. There's things that people say in
[48:24] the back, in the past. There's there's
[48:27] past hurts. There's past experiences.
[48:29] There's there's past things. And and and
[48:32] but if you're moving on, you cannot let
[48:35] that bother you.
[48:36] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? You can't let the
[48:39] situations around you bother you. You're
[48:42] pressing on.
[48:44] &gt;&gt; Pressing on.
[48:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:46] &gt;&gt; See, so leave the past behind until
[48:49] men's words don't bother you. Leave the
[48:52] past behind and press on until men's
[48:56] actions don't bother you. Situations
[48:59] arise in the church or at home or on the
[49:02] job. It doesn't affect you when you're
[49:05] looking forward and you're pressing
[49:07] towards the mark of the high calling.
[49:10] Can you say amen?
[49:12] &gt;&gt; Now I will tell you, we will always
[49:14] carry the past with us if we cannot
[49:16] forget.
[49:18] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? Things that were done
[49:21] 10 years ago, we have to forget it.
[49:24] &gt;&gt; Things that were done uh uh three years
[49:27] ago, we've got to forget it.
[49:29] &gt;&gt; Things that were done 10 minutes ago,
[49:32] we've got to forget it. Amen. What was
[49:35] is history. We're still looking. Amen.
[49:38] and pressing on to those things that are
[49:41] before.
[49:42] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? And I'm going to tell
[49:44] you something. There will never be a
[49:46] time here on this earth that you arrive.
[49:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:51] &gt;&gt; Hello. As long as you're breathing in
[49:53] this natural body and as long as you
[49:55] feeling the aches and pains and you're
[49:57] in this mortal life, you've always got
[50:00] something to get beyond to press forward
[50:03] to.
[50:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:05] &gt;&gt; That's right. If someone done you wrong
[50:07] or said something hateful to you or
[50:10] acted difference towards you or
[50:11] indifferent, leave it behind.
[50:14] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen, church?
[50:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. You got to leave it behind. And
[50:18] and and and this is why it's not easy.
[50:20] Amen. To leave the past behind and press
[50:23] toward the things that are before
[50:26] &gt;&gt; because we got this old flesh.
[50:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:29] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[50:30] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? So the prophet says,
[50:32] "Forgetting our differences, forgetting
[50:35] our weaknesses,
[50:37] we press on."
[50:39] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[50:40] &gt;&gt; So leaving the past behind means burning
[50:44] every bridge. Amen. That you you have uh
[50:48] crossed over. Ain't that right?
[50:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. You may not be able to burn the
[50:52] bridges before you. Amen. As a lot of
[50:54] people try to do, they're in so deep
[50:56] thought that they're already thinking
[50:58] about the future and trying to burn the
[50:59] bridges. Amen. Before they get there.
[51:02] Amen. You can't do that. Amen. But look,
[51:05] the things that you've gone through,
[51:06] burn them bridges behind.
[51:09] You've got to make up your mind. I'm
[51:11] going to serve God.
[51:14] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[51:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Brandham said, "Daniel had
[51:18] burned all the bridges behind. He wasn't
[51:22] planning going back anymore. He wasn't
[51:25] watching his back trail. He was looking,
[51:28] forsaking those things which were in the
[51:30] past. He pressed on to the mark of the
[51:33] prize of the high calling. And that's
[51:35] what we should be doing. That's what the
[51:38] church should be doing.
[51:41] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[51:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:43] &gt;&gt; He says you must always look where
[51:45] you're going, not where you've been.
[51:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:50] &gt;&gt; Don't look where you where you been.
[51:52] Look where you're going.
[51:54] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? See, the word of God
[51:57] isn't isn't to guide you, Amen, into
[52:00] your past. It's to guide you into your
[52:02] future.
[52:04] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[52:06] &gt;&gt; So, he says, if now I want you to listen
[52:08] now, cuz this is a warning to everyone
[52:10] of us, if you watch the rearview mirror,
[52:13] you will soon wreck up. That's
[52:17] &gt;&gt; what he said. Amen.
[52:18] &gt;&gt; You'll lose your anointing. You'll lose
[52:20] your zeal.
[52:23] &gt;&gt; You You'll lose your passion.
[52:26] You'll lose everything and you'll be a
[52:29] trash heap on a church bench even if you
[52:33] it may even take you out the doors
[52:36] &gt;&gt; out into the world.
[52:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. A wreck. Can you say amen? Now we
[52:42] find, amen, that the prophet speaking of
[52:45] the Lutheran and and the church ages and
[52:47] the the revivals, he said the the
[52:50] Lutheran wrecked up when Wesley's light
[52:54] came on. Amen. And they refused to move
[52:57] on.
[52:58] &gt;&gt; Wesley wrecked up and and and and we can
[53:02] we can actually see this the results of
[53:05] this wreck. They are a disaster. Their
[53:08] churches are a disaster.
[53:10] &gt;&gt; That's right. that no anointing.
[53:12] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[53:12] &gt;&gt; No, no uh freedom, no vision for the
[53:16] future.
[53:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:18] &gt;&gt; They ain't going anywhere but backwards.
[53:20] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[53:21] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? They've degraded from
[53:23] what their their their uh uh founding
[53:26] fathers were.
[53:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, the Lutheran wrecked up when
[53:31] Wesley's light came on. The Wesleyans
[53:33] wrecked up when the Pentecostal light
[53:35] came on. And the Pentecostals came
[53:38] wrecked up when the evening light came
[53:40] on.
[53:41] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? See, they should have
[53:44] looked, the prophet said, in the future
[53:46] instead of looking in the past.
[53:49] &gt;&gt; God was doing something before them and
[53:52] they should have followed into that, but
[53:54] they looked into the past.
[53:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:58] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[54:00] So a man will wreck up. Not only a
[54:03] church, but a man, a home, a marriage
[54:07] will wreck up if you keep looking in the
[54:10] past.
[54:11] &gt;&gt; So therefore, you cannot press on until
[54:14] you forget the past. Amen. Paul didn't
[54:18] just just tell us, you know, I'm
[54:19] pressing on, but he said, I'm leaving
[54:21] those things behind.
[54:23] &gt;&gt; I'm forgetting those things and I'm
[54:26] pressing on.
[54:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. Ain't that right?
[54:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:31] &gt;&gt; Now, the prophet says, you know, in in a
[54:35] prayer, he says, "May the Holy Ghost
[54:36] just reign in our hearts supremely that
[54:40] we will walk
[54:42] forgetting the things that are in the
[54:44] past,
[54:46] &gt;&gt; the mock admire that we once lived in."
[54:50] Can you say amen?
[54:52] &gt;&gt; Now, so this tells us then that if we
[54:55] are to walk, Amen. forgetting where we
[54:58] were and the muck and the mire that we
[55:00] once lived in.
[55:04] Then in order for the sinner to forget
[55:09] the past, he's got to be changed,
[55:13] he's got to actually come out of the
[55:15] past.
[55:16] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[55:16] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[55:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. And and and brother Brandon would
[55:20] tell us, he said, you say, "Well, I
[55:22] confess mine every night." Well, we got
[55:25] a prayer book and we when we go to
[55:27] church, we confess all of our sins and
[55:29] then turn back around and do them again.
[55:32] See, turn right back the next day. God,
[55:34] forgive me for drinking. Forgive me for
[55:36] committing adultery. Forgive me for
[55:37] lying. Forgive me for stealing. Turn
[55:39] right back and do the same thing.
[55:41] Forgive me for getting drunk last night
[55:43] or last week. I didn't mean to to drink
[55:45] that much. And then turn back around and
[55:48] drink it again. That shows something
[55:50] hasn't changed inside.
[55:52] You're trying to paint the outside, kind
[55:55] of uh whitewash it, but what it needs to
[55:58] be done is put in the blood of Jesus
[56:00] Christ and washed white instead of
[56:03] whitewashed.
[56:06] &gt;&gt; See, so it isn't the past until we come
[56:08] out of it.
[56:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:10] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[56:11] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. That's why uh Paul would tell
[56:14] us in 2 Corinthians 5:17, "Therefore, if
[56:18] any man be in Christ, he is a new
[56:20] creation or a new creature creation. Old
[56:25] things are passed away and behold, all
[56:27] things," everybody say, "All things."
[56:29] All things are become new. Now, we may
[56:33] not have reached everything that's new,
[56:35] but we're pressing for it.
[56:38] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[56:39] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Amen.
[56:40] &gt;&gt; We're press.
[56:42] So, as the prophet said, we don't look
[56:44] back.
[56:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:46] &gt;&gt; We look forward.
[56:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:48] &gt;&gt; We're not looking back.
[56:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:50] &gt;&gt; Yesterday was yesterday.
[56:54] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[56:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:57] &gt;&gt; To the Christian, the new year
[57:01] that comes, it brings new hope.
[57:04] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[57:05] &gt;&gt; Each new day, think of that. Each new
[57:08] day,
[57:08] &gt;&gt; yes, it's true. We might live today out,
[57:11] but there's a tomorrow.
[57:14] &gt;&gt; And that tomorrow
[57:16] brings new hope.
[57:20] &gt;&gt; We started at 7:00 tonight
[57:24] and it's whatever time
[57:28] &gt;&gt; and yet all of that has been passed.
[57:32] &gt;&gt; Every hour, that's right,
[57:34] &gt;&gt; is bringing new hope. Amen.
[57:36] &gt;&gt; Every minute
[57:37] &gt;&gt; is bringing new hope to a Christian.
[57:40] &gt;&gt; How many believes that?
[57:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. Every rising of the sun, there's a
[57:44] new hope.
[57:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. Why? Amen. See, because we we know
[57:49] that it's bringing us closer. It's
[57:52] taking us closer. Amen. To what we are
[57:56] pressing forward.
[58:01] &gt;&gt; It takes the grace of God to press on.
[58:04] It takes the grace of God to be able to
[58:06] forget the past.
[58:10] Now to forget those things,
[58:13] it has to come by forgiveness.
[58:16] &gt;&gt; Forgetting those things left behind
[58:18] comes by forgiveness.
[58:21] What is forgiveness? It's a release from
[58:23] guilt or penalty of an offense.
[58:27] Forgiveness, the prophet would tell us,
[58:29] is a pardon. Can you say amen? When God
[58:32] gave forgave you, he pardoned you.
[58:36] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[58:37] &gt;&gt; Which released you from your past.
[58:42] &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad you've been released
[58:43] from your past?
[58:45] &gt;&gt; Paul is telling us because we've been
[58:47] pardoned, we can forget about the past.
[58:50] &gt;&gt; If we hadn't been pardoned, we couldn't
[58:52] walk away from the past.
[58:56] &gt;&gt; Cain couldn't walk from the away from
[58:58] the past. Condemnation held over him as
[59:02] long as he lived.
[59:03] &gt;&gt; Yeah,
[59:04] &gt;&gt; for sure.
[59:05] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[59:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:06] &gt;&gt; But see, God released us. Now there's no
[59:11] more guilt.
[59:12] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[59:13] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[59:13] &gt;&gt; How many's glad for that?
[59:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:16] &gt;&gt; So for us to keep walking in the past
[59:19] would be an insult to to God's pardoning
[59:22] grace. Yeah.
[59:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:27] &gt;&gt; Hebrews 10:14, for by one offering he
[59:30] hath perfected forever them that are
[59:32] sanctified.
[59:34] Whereof the Holy Ghost also is a witness
[59:36] to us. For after that he had said
[59:38] before, this is the covenant that I will
[59:40] make with them after those days, sayith
[59:42] the Lord, I will put my laws into their
[59:45] hearts, and in their minds will I write
[59:48] them, and their sins and iniquities will
[59:51] I remember no more.
[59:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:54] &gt;&gt; So God created a sea of forgetfulness,
[59:57] which was his own blood.
[1:00:00] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:00:02] &gt;&gt; And he done that for his purpose.
[1:00:06] an infinite God
[1:00:08] &gt;&gt; that knows all things.
[1:00:11] &gt;&gt; But yet once your sins and iniquities
[1:00:15] are put in that blood that bleachs that
[1:00:18] seeth forgetfulness, he cannot remember
[1:00:22] them.
[1:00:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:00:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:26] &gt;&gt; That's how you can walk away from your
[1:00:28] past.
[1:00:30] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? See, we we were He
[1:00:33] redeemed us,
[1:00:35] &gt;&gt; justified us.
[1:00:37] &gt;&gt; Then Paul is is setting that example to
[1:00:40] us and setting it to us. Now walk away
[1:00:43] from it.
[1:00:44] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:00:45] &gt;&gt; Forget it.
[1:00:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:50] &gt;&gt; Not just your past when you gave your
[1:00:51] heart to the Lord, when you was out
[1:00:53] there drinking and sleitting around and
[1:00:55] whatever you was doing, but what about
[1:00:57] yesterday?
[1:00:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:59] &gt;&gt; What about this morning?
[1:01:01] What about at noon?
[1:01:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:03] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:01:05] &gt;&gt; We're walking. We're continuing walking.
[1:01:11] &gt;&gt; God used Israel to show
[1:01:14] us that his mercy
[1:01:18] allows us to walk away
[1:01:23] from our past. In Jeremiah 42:12,
[1:01:28] God says, "And I will show mercies unto
[1:01:30] you that you that he may have mercy upon
[1:01:33] you and cause you to return to your own
[1:01:37] land."
[1:01:38] &gt;&gt; Can you say, "Amen."
[1:01:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. You you you were there at one time
[1:01:42] and and you were sold into slavery. And
[1:01:46] now he says, "But I'm going to show
[1:01:47] mercy unto you, not for you to stay
[1:01:50] there, but to walk away
[1:01:53] &gt;&gt; and go back to what belongs to you."
[1:01:57] &gt;&gt; As the prophet said in uh Lamentation
[1:02:00] 3:22, "It is of the Lord's mercy that we
[1:02:03] are not consumed because his compassions
[1:02:06] fail not. They are new every morning.
[1:02:09] Great is thy faithfulness.
[1:02:12] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[1:02:13] &gt;&gt; So I believe it was said one time, the
[1:02:15] grace of God means that I get what I
[1:02:18] don't deserve.
[1:02:21] &gt;&gt; Right? The grace of God means that I get
[1:02:24] what I don't deserve. I don't deserve
[1:02:27] his love and his faithfulness.
[1:02:30] &gt;&gt; I don't forget deserve his forgiveness,
[1:02:33] but I get it.
[1:02:35] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? I don't deserve to
[1:02:38] rule and to reign with him in the
[1:02:40] millennium, but I'm going to.
[1:02:43] &gt;&gt; I I I don't deserve to live in the new
[1:02:46] city, a new Jerusalem, but I'm going to.
[1:02:49] &gt;&gt; I don't deserve eternal life, but I have
[1:02:52] it.
[1:02:53] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:02:55] &gt;&gt; It's because the grace of God has given
[1:02:58] me these things.
[1:03:00] &gt;&gt; The mercy of God means that I do not get
[1:03:03] what I deserve.
[1:03:05] Can you say amen?
[1:03:07] &gt;&gt; I deserve hell, but I'm not going there.
[1:03:11] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:03:12] &gt;&gt; I I deserve to be wretched and
[1:03:14] miserable, but I'm not.
[1:03:16] &gt;&gt; I I deserve tribulation, but I'm not
[1:03:19] going there.
[1:03:20] &gt;&gt; I I deserve death and destruction and
[1:03:23] eternal annihilation, but I'm not going
[1:03:26] to happen that way. That's not my story.
[1:03:30] &gt;&gt; It's the mercy of God.
[1:03:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:34] And it's all because of the blood.
[1:03:36] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:03:38] &gt;&gt; Paul said, "We have redemption through
[1:03:40] the blood of Christ and forgiveness of
[1:03:43] sins according to the riches of his
[1:03:46] grace." I say that again. We have
[1:03:48] redemption through the blood of Christ
[1:03:50] and forgiveness of sins.
[1:03:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:53] &gt;&gt; According to the riches of his grace.
[1:03:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:57] &gt;&gt; You'll you'll never exhaust the grace of
[1:03:59] God. You'll never bankrupt God with his
[1:04:02] grace. Can you say amen?
[1:04:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:05] &gt;&gt; So then God pardons us by forgiving
[1:04:08] our sins and trespasses and releasing us
[1:04:12] from all guilt and and shame.
[1:04:16] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:04:17] &gt;&gt; Therefore, we can walk away from the
[1:04:19] past.
[1:04:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. Right.
[1:04:23] &gt;&gt; I'm so glad for that, brother Tim.
[1:04:26] &gt;&gt; The things I was, I'm not now.
[1:04:29] &gt;&gt; Because I'm walking. Yeah.
[1:04:32] &gt;&gt; I'm pressing toward those things.
[1:04:36] &gt;&gt; I'm keeping Christ before me.
[1:04:38] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:04:39] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:04:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, so we got to forget it. Forget
[1:04:45] the past. Forget forget the hurts.
[1:04:48] Forget the mistakes.
[1:04:50] &gt;&gt; Forget the failures.
[1:04:54] Brother Brandham said, "If I can forget
[1:04:56] what I was and remember what he is,
[1:04:58] that's
[1:04:59] &gt;&gt; if I can remember Jesus, if I can
[1:05:01] remember him at the cross, if I can
[1:05:03] remember what he done for me and I can
[1:05:06] rem and and I can remember the hour that
[1:05:08] he washed my sins away
[1:05:11] and give me the Holy Ghost to guide me."
[1:05:14] Notice that I'm lifted up above
[1:05:17] everything that holds this earth. I'm
[1:05:20] lifted above every earthly thing in the
[1:05:23] heavenly places in Christ Jesus where I
[1:05:26] can fellowship with him there in his
[1:05:30] presence forgetting what I ever was
[1:05:34] &gt;&gt; forgetting all my sins and everything
[1:05:37] where in his presence
[1:05:41] &gt;&gt; because they're in the sea of
[1:05:42] forgetfulness forgetting all my past
[1:05:45] forgetting everything and remember that
[1:05:47] he made me his own By his own death, he
[1:05:50] took my place.
[1:05:52] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord.
[1:05:55] &gt;&gt; Now, if you could think of the
[1:05:57] forgiveness, how many believes you've
[1:05:58] been forgiven of God?
[1:06:00] &gt;&gt; I believe.
[1:06:04] &gt;&gt; Well, most of us.
[1:06:07] I hope the rest of you find out that
[1:06:09] forgiveness.
[1:06:13] It's a wonderful thing to know you've
[1:06:15] been forgiven.
[1:06:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:17] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Because then your soul
[1:06:19] becomes light.
[1:06:21] Amen.
[1:06:22] &gt;&gt; You're not carrying the weight of
[1:06:23] condemnation, the guilt.
[1:06:26] Right.
[1:06:26] &gt;&gt; That's right. That's right.
[1:06:28] &gt;&gt; But now notice what Paul said in
[1:06:30] Ephesians 4:31,
[1:06:33] what he tells us now. Let all
[1:06:34] bitterness, everybody say, let all
[1:06:36] bitterness
[1:06:38] &gt;&gt; and wrath and anger, Come on, say it
[1:06:41] with me. And anger
[1:06:44] &gt;&gt; and clamor
[1:06:45] &gt;&gt; and evil speaking. be put away from you
[1:06:49] with all malice.
[1:06:51] &gt;&gt; Okay, say it with me on this one. 32nd
[1:06:53] verse. And be ye kind
[1:06:56] &gt;&gt; one to another, tenderhearted,
[1:06:59] forgiving one another.
[1:07:02] Uh forgiving one another.
[1:07:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:04] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:07:05] &gt;&gt; Forgiving one another even as God for
[1:07:09] Christ's sake hath forgiven you.
[1:07:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:14] &gt;&gt; Absolutely.
[1:07:15] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? Amen.
[1:07:18] &gt;&gt; Colossians 3:13, forbearing one another,
[1:07:22] forgiving one another. If any man have a
[1:07:25] quarrel against any, even as Christ
[1:07:28] forgave you, so also do ye.
[1:07:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:32] &gt;&gt; So then the forgiveness of Christ is to
[1:07:36] continue in us,
[1:07:40] &gt;&gt; with us.
[1:07:42] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:07:44] It's the only way you're going to forget
[1:07:45] the past.
[1:07:47] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:07:48] &gt;&gt; It's the only way you can walk away from
[1:07:50] it.
[1:07:51] &gt;&gt; It's the only way that the bitterness
[1:07:53] won't come into your heart.
[1:07:55] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:07:57] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:07:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:59] &gt;&gt; Now,
[1:08:03] Brother Brham said, "If you're a sinner,
[1:08:05] raise up your eyes and look." Now, if
[1:08:07] you've been indifferent, if you've had
[1:08:09] little squables and little things, what
[1:08:11] difference does it make? You're gonna
[1:08:13] die one of these days. How many believes
[1:08:16] that?
[1:08:18] &gt;&gt; You're gonna die one of these days. What
[1:08:20] day? Maybe today.
[1:08:24] &gt;&gt; You don't know. An hour from now, you
[1:08:27] may be in hell or you may be in heaven.
[1:08:30] &gt;&gt; But you've got to choose now. If there's
[1:08:33] anything in your life that isn't right,
[1:08:34] you choose now by faith. You say, "Well,
[1:08:39] if I can just get even with her, if I
[1:08:42] can just get even with him, no matter
[1:08:44] what they've done, choose life."
[1:08:48] &gt;&gt; Choose life.
[1:08:50] &gt;&gt; For Jesus said, "If from your heart you
[1:08:52] don't forgive every person their
[1:08:53] trespasses or transgressions, neither
[1:08:56] does your heavenly father forgive you."
[1:08:59] &gt;&gt; So, just get that close. If there's one
[1:09:03] ought in your heart against any person,
[1:09:06] sinner or saint, you're in danger of
[1:09:08] hellfire.
[1:09:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:10] &gt;&gt; Now, lift up your eyes. What do you see?
[1:09:12] Your enemy.
[1:09:15] &gt;&gt; I'll put it this way. Your enemy. Not
[1:09:17] pointing to the prophet or the picture
[1:09:20] that's behind you.
[1:09:22] &gt;&gt; Or do you see Christ
[1:09:25] &gt;&gt; before you?
[1:09:27] &gt;&gt; Are you looking in the rearview mirror
[1:09:28] of what actions people had done?
[1:09:31] Or are you looking to Christ and
[1:09:33] forgetting those things that are behind?
[1:09:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:40] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:09:42] &gt;&gt; Now the Bible tells us
[1:09:47] that forgiveness is given to us
[1:09:51] as we forgive others.
[1:09:55] &gt;&gt; We can be released from our guilt
[1:09:58] as we release others. You sure can
[1:10:01] &gt;&gt; from guilt.
[1:10:06] &gt;&gt; In Matthew 6:12, Jesus told us to pray
[1:10:09] this and forgive us our debts
[1:10:12] as we forgive our debtors.
[1:10:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:15] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:10:17] &gt;&gt; Matthew 6:14, "For if ye forgive men
[1:10:21] their trespasses, your heavenly father
[1:10:23] will also forgive you." Let me ask you,
[1:10:25] how many needs forgiveness?
[1:10:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:29] I need it
[1:10:31] &gt;&gt; every day.
[1:10:33] &gt;&gt; And not only will I need it now or to
[1:10:36] yesterday, I'll need it tomorrow.
[1:10:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:39] &gt;&gt; You understand?
[1:10:41] &gt;&gt; See?
[1:10:44] So, but if you forgive not in their
[1:10:47] trespasses, neither will your father
[1:10:49] forgive your trespasses.
[1:10:52] &gt;&gt; That's right. Yes.
[1:10:54] &gt;&gt; He ain't measuring what hurt you got.
[1:10:58] He ain't measuring the cuts you have.
[1:11:02] &gt;&gt; He ain't measuring how emotionally upset
[1:11:04] you are.
[1:11:06] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[1:11:08] &gt;&gt; As believers, we cannot dwell in the
[1:11:11] past.
[1:11:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:13] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:11:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:20] &gt;&gt; Satan's job to keep us in the past.
[1:11:23] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:11:24] things that happened in childhood.
[1:11:27] &gt;&gt; People grow up to be adults, married
[1:11:29] with children, and still hanging on to
[1:11:30] past.
[1:11:36] &gt;&gt; And that's why it takes the grace of God
[1:11:38] to forget.
[1:11:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:41] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:11:43] &gt;&gt; And it doesn't mean that we're not Holy
[1:11:45] Ghost filled. It just means there's that
[1:11:48] sticky nature.
[1:11:49] &gt;&gt; That's right. That's That's right. that
[1:11:51] we got to deal with.
[1:11:53] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:11:54] &gt;&gt; And bring it in subjection
[1:11:58] &gt;&gt; by faith.
[1:11:59] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord
[1:11:59] &gt;&gt; to the word.
[1:12:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:04] &gt;&gt; You believe it?
[1:12:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:07] &gt;&gt; So then again, if if we won't release
[1:12:09] others of their past, we can't be
[1:12:11] released from our past.
[1:12:12] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:12:15] &gt;&gt; You might say, well, what if they're
[1:12:16] doing it present tense?
[1:12:19] You remember this? While the people were
[1:12:22] mocking Jesus,
[1:12:24] while they were wagging their tongue at
[1:12:27] him, while he's hanging on the cross,
[1:12:31] &gt;&gt; and while they're criticizing him,
[1:12:33] scorning him, making fun of him, he
[1:12:37] looks at them and says, "Father, forgive
[1:12:40] them."
[1:12:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:44] &gt;&gt; Forgive them. Why? For they know not
[1:12:48] what they do.
[1:12:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. I want to tell you something. Why
[1:12:51] didn't they know? Because they were
[1:12:52] blinded.
[1:12:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:56] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[1:12:57] &gt;&gt; They were blinded.
[1:13:00] God had blinded their eyes.
[1:13:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:05] &gt;&gt; And people today are blinded.
[1:13:08] &gt;&gt; True.
[1:13:09] &gt;&gt; True.
[1:13:10] &gt;&gt; True.
[1:13:12] &gt;&gt; Many people are just anointed by an evil
[1:13:14] spirit.
[1:13:15] &gt;&gt; That's right. They'll do things so
[1:13:18] ungodly to other people.
[1:13:20] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:13:22] &gt;&gt; That in their right mind, they wouldn't
[1:13:24] have done them things.
[1:13:26] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:13:26] &gt;&gt; But they've given themselves over to
[1:13:28] spirits.
[1:13:30] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:13:31] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:13:35] &gt;&gt; Paul would say that the god of this
[1:13:37] world have blinded the minds of them
[1:13:39] that believe not.
[1:13:41] &gt;&gt; Blinded their eyes. But there are times
[1:13:43] that people do things that are good
[1:13:46] meaning people, righteous people, and
[1:13:47] they don't even know what they've done
[1:13:49] to you.
[1:13:51] &gt;&gt; They're ignorant of these things.
[1:13:54] And then what does Satan do? He builds a
[1:13:57] complex.
[1:13:59] &gt;&gt; He builds things in our minds.
[1:14:01] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:14:02] &gt;&gt; To where it affects our worship. It
[1:14:05] affects our prayer life. It affects our
[1:14:08] dedication, our consecration.
[1:14:11] Yeah.
[1:14:11] &gt;&gt; It it it affects the fellowship.
[1:14:16] &gt;&gt; It even affects where we're able not
[1:14:18] able to say amen to the word of God.
[1:14:21] &gt;&gt; And yet it's Satan building these walls.
[1:14:24] &gt;&gt; That maybe some the other person don't
[1:14:26] even know what they've done.
[1:14:29] &gt;&gt; Maybe they just had a bad day. Maybe
[1:14:31] they were in a hurry.
[1:14:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:37] &gt;&gt; And and and didn't mean to ignore you.
[1:14:41] We got to forget
[1:14:43] the past.
[1:14:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:46] &gt;&gt; Walk away from the past.
[1:14:49] Hello.
[1:14:49] &gt;&gt; Yes. God.
[1:14:52] &gt;&gt; And press forward.
[1:14:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:58] &gt;&gt; You love him.
[1:14:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. And see, it's by the same blood
[1:15:02] that we were forgiven of by with
[1:15:07] that same blood we forgive others.
[1:15:12] &gt;&gt; By that same blood.
[1:15:14] &gt;&gt; I want to say this. Unforgiveness binds
[1:15:16] us to the past.
[1:15:20] It binds us to our own past. When we
[1:15:23] can't forgive ourselves,
[1:15:25] we constantly looking at what we've done
[1:15:27] and our mistakes and our failures and
[1:15:33] when you pray and you're constantly
[1:15:35] bring it up to the Lord.
[1:15:36] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:15:37] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[1:15:40] &gt;&gt; Constantly asking forgiveness for the
[1:15:42] same old thing, past mistakes.
[1:15:46] &gt;&gt; It shows that we've not walked away from
[1:15:48] the past.
[1:15:49] &gt;&gt; That's right. That's right, brother. Go
[1:15:51] ahead.
[1:15:52] So we we unforgiveness binds us to our
[1:15:55] own past but it also will bind us to the
[1:15:58] other's past.
[1:16:05] &gt;&gt; So you got to forgive yourself.
[1:16:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:08] &gt;&gt; You got to see yourself what what God
[1:16:10] sees about you.
[1:16:11] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:16:12] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[1:16:13] &gt;&gt; If God's forgiven you, then you're
[1:16:15] forgiven. Accept your pardon.
[1:16:17] &gt;&gt; True.
[1:16:18] &gt;&gt; Walk away from the past.
[1:16:21] Hello, sir.
[1:16:23] &gt;&gt; Can't keep dwelling on it. Can't keep
[1:16:25] living in it. We've got a place to go.
[1:16:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:30] &gt;&gt; We got somewhere to press to.
[1:16:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:36] &gt;&gt; So, it's impossible to move on while
[1:16:39] keeping the past before us. You see, God
[1:16:42] couldn't move on in a relationship and
[1:16:44] fellowship with us if he kept
[1:16:46] remembering our past.
[1:16:48] So God in in desiring a relationship
[1:16:51] with us and fellowship with us, he had
[1:16:54] to have a remedy to where he would no
[1:16:57] longer see you as a sinner. He would no
[1:17:00] longer see you in all your faults and
[1:17:02] your failures and your miseries
[1:17:07] &gt;&gt; cuz he couldn't fellowship with you.
[1:17:10] &gt;&gt; So he had to find a remedy to wipe it
[1:17:12] all clean. Amen.
[1:17:14] &gt;&gt; Now you've come into his presence and he
[1:17:16] can't see you. The problem said he
[1:17:19] doesn't see you. He sees the blood.
[1:17:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:23] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[1:17:24] &gt;&gt; So you're no longer a sinner in his
[1:17:26] sight.
[1:17:28] &gt;&gt; Now if we can have that blood before us
[1:17:31] for one another.
[1:17:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:34] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:17:36] See? And so we find that there there
[1:17:39] there is no limit to the amount of
[1:17:43] forgiveness we are to give.
[1:17:46] Everybody say there's no limit.
[1:17:48] &gt;&gt; No limit.
[1:17:51] &gt;&gt; No limit. Matthew 18:21. Then came Peter
[1:17:54] to him and said, Lord, how oft shall my
[1:17:57] brother sin against me? And I forgive
[1:17:59] him till seven times. Jesus saith unto
[1:18:02] him, I say not unto thee until seven
[1:18:04] times, but until 70 * 7.
[1:18:07] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:18:09] &gt;&gt; Luke 17:3, "Take heed to yourselves, if
[1:18:11] thy brother trespass against thee,
[1:18:14] rebuke him. And if he repent, forgive
[1:18:16] him. And if he trespass against thee
[1:18:18] seven times in a day, and seven times in
[1:18:21] a day turn again to thee, saying, I
[1:18:24] repent, thou shalt forgive him."
[1:18:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now notice what the prophet said.
[1:18:29] When we get to that brotherly kindness,
[1:18:31] put yourself in his place on the matter.
[1:18:35] My brother sinned against me, said
[1:18:36] Peter. Shall I forgive him seven times a
[1:18:40] day? Brother Brown said, Jesus said,
[1:18:43] seven * 7. Can you say amen?
[1:18:47] &gt;&gt; 70* 7. Brotherly kindness. See, if you
[1:18:51] see a brother that is all out of tune,
[1:18:53] don't be impatient with him. No. Be kind
[1:18:57] to him.
[1:18:58] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:19:01] &gt;&gt; Have faith. Everybody say, "Have faith
[1:19:04] &gt;&gt; that God will bring him in."
[1:19:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:09] &gt;&gt; Now, we know that a pardon is not a
[1:19:11] pardon unless received as a pardon.
[1:19:15] &gt;&gt; So, the pardon's got to be accepted.
[1:19:18] Pardon has no effect upon a man until he
[1:19:21] accepts it.
[1:19:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. We accept our pardon by believing
[1:19:26] it and then asking for forgiveness.
[1:19:29] For a man to ask for forgiveness shows
[1:19:32] that he believes in the pardon.
[1:19:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:19:37] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[1:19:39] If I'm going to get down to the altar,
[1:19:41] I'm going to say, "God, I I I'm asking
[1:19:43] you to forgive me. If I didn't believe
[1:19:46] in that pardoning grace,
[1:19:49] then why would I ask for him to forgive
[1:19:51] me?" That's right.
[1:19:53] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[1:19:53] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:19:54] &gt;&gt; But I believe in that.
[1:19:56] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:19:57] &gt;&gt; Now, as as we wind down here, but
[1:20:02] we are to leave the past behind and at
[1:20:05] the same time,
[1:20:07] we are to press forward.
[1:20:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:11] &gt;&gt; Press towards the mark of the high
[1:20:13] calling of God.
[1:20:16] That word press is to act upon through
[1:20:18] steady pushing
[1:20:20] or thrusting force exerted in contact.
[1:20:24] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:20:26] &gt;&gt; Steady pushing.
[1:20:29] &gt;&gt; Pressing a force exerting.
[1:20:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:34] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:20:34] &gt;&gt; Hello.
[1:20:36] &gt;&gt; I'm too tired. You ain't tired enough.
[1:20:39] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:20:40] &gt;&gt; Just quit exerting. Amen.
[1:20:43] &gt;&gt; You may have not felt to come to church
[1:20:45] tonight, but you got up and you exerted.
[1:20:49] &gt;&gt; You exerted your energy.
[1:20:51] &gt;&gt; You may not feel like praying, but
[1:20:53] you're pressing.
[1:20:55] &gt;&gt; You may not feel like forgiving, but
[1:20:57] you're pressing.
[1:20:59] &gt;&gt; You may not feel like just giving
[1:21:01] everything over to God, but you're
[1:21:03] pressing.
[1:21:05] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:21:08] &gt;&gt; The Bible says, "Many are the
[1:21:09] afflictions of the righteous.
[1:21:13] Ain't that right?
[1:21:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:15] &gt;&gt; Now, Brother Ram said, "These
[1:21:16] afflictions are testings
[1:21:20] that God sends our way." So, don't think
[1:21:24] Don't think for a moment that the devil
[1:21:27] can bother you without God knowing it or
[1:21:31] without God's permission.
[1:21:33] Many are the afflictions or testings of
[1:21:36] the righteous that God sends their way.
[1:21:42] &gt;&gt; God going to send it your way.
[1:21:48] &gt;&gt; Bible says footsteps of the Lord are
[1:21:50] ordered. The footsteps of the righteous
[1:21:52] are ordered by the Lord.
[1:21:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:54] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:21:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:56] &gt;&gt; If I had my way, I'd keep it all from
[1:21:58] you. That's not God's way.
[1:21:59] &gt;&gt; That's right. If I had my way, I'd keep
[1:22:02] it all for me. But that ain't God's way.
[1:22:05] Hello.
[1:22:06] &gt;&gt; And I and I shouldn't I shouldn't wake
[1:22:09] up dreading the day.
[1:22:11] &gt;&gt; What next?
[1:22:12] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:22:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:16] &gt;&gt; Preach.
[1:22:18] &gt;&gt; Oh goodness.
[1:22:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:20] &gt;&gt; Now, Brother Brandham, now notice how
[1:22:22] brother Brandham approaches this. He
[1:22:25] said, "How we appreciate that trials and
[1:22:28] tribulations." Have you ever just
[1:22:30] prayed, "Lord, I appreciate it."
[1:22:35] &gt;&gt; But here is the prophet
[1:22:38] and he's saying how we appreciate it.
[1:22:41] Trials and tribulations and tests all
[1:22:45] working for the good.
[1:22:47] &gt;&gt; After a while, God can see them and he
[1:22:51] can put his trust in you.
[1:22:54] &gt;&gt; Praise our God.
[1:22:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. when he sees you keep pressing on.
[1:23:00] &gt;&gt; When he sees that you're not just
[1:23:02] sitting around crying about things
[1:23:06] and you're not dwelling on the past, but
[1:23:09] you're pressing,
[1:23:11] &gt;&gt; God sees it and says, "I can put trust
[1:23:13] in him.
[1:23:16] &gt;&gt; Trust in her."
[1:23:18] &gt;&gt; And then he will do great things for
[1:23:19] you.
[1:23:20] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:23:21] &gt;&gt; Say that again. And after a while, God
[1:23:23] can see in that he can put his trust in
[1:23:26] you and then he will do great things for
[1:23:29] you.
[1:23:30] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[1:23:30] &gt;&gt; can you say amen?
[1:23:32] &gt;&gt; So when bitterness is trying to overtake
[1:23:34] you, press towards the mark of the high
[1:23:36] calling of God.
[1:23:38] &gt;&gt; When the spirit of unbelief is trying to
[1:23:40] overtake you, press to for the mark or
[1:23:43] the prize of the high calling of God.
[1:23:45] When fear is trying to overtake you,
[1:23:47] when discouragement is trying to do you
[1:23:50] under and and confusion is trying to set
[1:23:52] in, press toward the markise
[1:23:56] &gt;&gt; of the high calling of God. Can you say
[1:23:58] amen?
[1:24:00] &gt;&gt; Because when you're pressing towards,
[1:24:02] you're going forward.
[1:24:04] &gt;&gt; When you're pressing, you're going
[1:24:06] forward. You're pressing, Brother Bill,
[1:24:08] is not in vain.
[1:24:12] &gt;&gt; Very true.
[1:24:13] &gt;&gt; You love the Lord. Amen.
[1:24:15] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:24:16] &gt;&gt; Your pressing's not in vain.
[1:24:19] &gt;&gt; He didn't promise us a flower flowery
[1:24:22] bed of ease.
[1:24:23] &gt;&gt; But he promised we're going to make it.
[1:24:26] &gt;&gt; He did promise that there's a sunshine
[1:24:29] there. There's there's eternal things at
[1:24:32] the end of this thing.
[1:24:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:24:35] &gt;&gt; Keep pressing.
[1:24:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:39] &gt;&gt; You see, Christians don't give up and
[1:24:40] quit.
[1:24:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. If you have given your heart to
[1:24:44] Jesus Christ and haven't been baptized,
[1:24:47] then I'd encourage you to do so. Keep
[1:24:49] pressing. You press into that. Don't
[1:24:53] just sit around and be dirty and just be
[1:24:56] halfhazard about it. If God saved you,
[1:24:59] we ought that ought to make us the
[1:25:01] happiest people on the face of the
[1:25:03] earth.
[1:25:04] &gt;&gt; Press on to be baptized. Brother Bram
[1:25:07] said, "Baptism is essentual to
[1:25:09] salvation." If you've been baptized and
[1:25:12] you haven't received the Holy Ghost,
[1:25:14] don't you stop there. Amen. But you
[1:25:17] press.
[1:25:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:21] &gt;&gt; Press.
[1:25:23] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:25:24] &gt;&gt; To receive it. If you believe that God
[1:25:26] sent a prophet and this message came
[1:25:28] from the prophet of Malachi 4, then
[1:25:30] press on to believe all that he taught.
[1:25:33] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:25:35] &gt;&gt; Press on till your flesh becomes the
[1:25:37] word. Yeah.
[1:25:39] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:25:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:42] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham, he says each new year,
[1:25:45] you know,
[1:25:47] people approach the new year
[1:25:51] and they try to press into it by turning
[1:25:53] a new page.
[1:25:55] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:25:56] &gt;&gt; But he said that's not how you press
[1:25:57] into the new year, turning a new leaf,
[1:26:01] you know, saying a New Year's resolution
[1:26:04] or whatever. But that's not what we how
[1:26:06] we press on. Brother Ram said we press
[1:26:09] into the future by turning to the word.
[1:26:12] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:26:13] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? We're not entering
[1:26:15] into the future. I don't want to face
[1:26:17] tomorrow. Amen. Just open-minded with
[1:26:20] well happy golucky. Whatever come my
[1:26:22] way, that's what I'll get. No, I want to
[1:26:25] look at that word and see what's
[1:26:27] promised.
[1:26:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:31] &gt;&gt; He said, see what the word promises for
[1:26:33] today. see what the light of the day is
[1:26:36] supposed to be. What we ought to do this
[1:26:38] year is not go back to creeds and
[1:26:40] things. Go back to our old
[1:26:41] denominations, not go back to old
[1:26:43] denominations, but turn to the word. See
[1:26:47] what kind of light is supposed to shine
[1:26:49] today.
[1:26:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:52] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? See what a born again
[1:26:54] believer is to be of today.
[1:26:58] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:27:00] &gt;&gt; See, oh church, turn to the word. Get
[1:27:02] back to the word. Flip the right switch.
[1:27:05] Quit punching around on electric lights
[1:27:07] and artificial man-made light. See, turn
[1:27:10] to his word and see the promise of
[1:27:12] today.
[1:27:14] &gt;&gt; Then see what the promise is and watch
[1:27:15] for its identification. When it's
[1:27:17] vindicated, then you know whether you're
[1:27:19] in the light or not. See what the
[1:27:21] promise is. Can you say amen?
[1:27:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:24] &gt;&gt; And as we look to the word, we see what
[1:27:26] age we're living in.
[1:27:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:29] &gt;&gt; We see that we're living in the grandest
[1:27:31] age of all ages.
[1:27:33] Why? Because it's the it's the ending of
[1:27:36] time and the blending of eternity.
[1:27:39] &gt;&gt; We're here, church. We're living in the
[1:27:42] rapture age.
[1:27:43] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that the mighty angel has
[1:27:46] descended and has declared time shall be
[1:27:49] no more,
[1:27:51] &gt;&gt; church? There is going to be a last time
[1:27:55] for everything.
[1:27:56] &gt;&gt; There's going to be a last time that you
[1:27:58] come to this church. There's going to be
[1:28:00] a last time that you hear a message
[1:28:02] preached. There's going to be a last
[1:28:04] time, amen, that you say, "Amen," in
[1:28:07] this mortal body. There's going to be a
[1:28:10] last time that you hug your brother and
[1:28:12] shake your sister's hand. There's going
[1:28:15] to be a last trial that you go through.
[1:28:19] &gt;&gt; For sure,
[1:28:21] &gt;&gt; the works of men will cease. Politics
[1:28:24] will cease. Religions will cease. Hate
[1:28:26] and bitterness will cease. civilization
[1:28:28] as we know it's going to cease.
[1:28:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:31] &gt;&gt; And these things these things aren't the
[1:28:33] high calling that we're pressing to.
[1:28:35] We're not pressing to be a politician.
[1:28:37] We're not pressing, Amen, to to to reach
[1:28:40] some great status in the church. We're
[1:28:42] not pressing for these things. And one
[1:28:45] place, Brother Brandham tells us that
[1:28:46] the high calling is the complete
[1:28:49] identification. the complete
[1:28:52] identification when all time will fade
[1:28:55] out into eternity when Jesus comes.
[1:28:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:59] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:29:01] &gt;&gt; It's then we'll be changed from mortal
[1:29:04] to immortality.
[1:29:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:06] &gt;&gt; Sin will be gone and there will be a new
[1:29:08] heaven and a new earth.
[1:29:10] &gt;&gt; There will be a millennium. We will be
[1:29:12] living in the new city, new Jerusalem.
[1:29:14] Revelations 22:5. And there shall be no
[1:29:17] night there. They they need no candle,
[1:29:20] neither light of the sun, for the Lord
[1:29:22] God giveth them light, and they shall
[1:29:24] reign forever and forever. Can you say,
[1:29:28] "Amen." These are the things that were
[1:29:29] pressing to. Amen. Jesus said in John
[1:29:32] 14:1, "Let not your heart be troubled.
[1:29:34] Ye believe in God, believe also in me."
[1:29:37] Amen. In my father's house are many
[1:29:39] mansions. If it were not so, I would
[1:29:40] have told you. I go to prepare a place
[1:29:43] for you. If I go and prepare a place for
[1:29:47] you, I will come again and receive you
[1:29:49] unto myself, that where I am, there you
[1:29:52] may be also.
[1:29:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:55] &gt;&gt; How do we know we're going to that
[1:29:57] place?
[1:29:58] How do we know? How do I know? How do
[1:30:00] you know? David said, "It's the deep
[1:30:02] calling to the deep."
[1:30:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:05] &gt;&gt; And it's the deep in us that is
[1:30:06] responding to the call.
[1:30:08] &gt;&gt; It's what's causing us to keep pressing
[1:30:10] towards.
[1:30:12] &gt;&gt; It won't let us get slack. It won't let
[1:30:14] us get when our hands start getting
[1:30:16] weary
[1:30:17] &gt;&gt; and we want to just sit down and give
[1:30:19] up. There's something in us that just
[1:30:22] keeps causing us.
[1:30:23] &gt;&gt; It's pulsating. It's that bubbly spring
[1:30:26] that Brother Brandham talked about.
[1:30:28] There's just something there. See, we're
[1:30:30] not just sitting around waiting and
[1:30:33] dillydallying with the world and and all
[1:30:35] of these things, but we're pressing. You
[1:30:38] see what we're doing in here tonight and
[1:30:40] and tomorrow and every minute of the day
[1:30:43] is we're giving witness to the place
[1:30:45] that we're going. We're giving witness
[1:30:48] that there is something beyond this
[1:30:50] mortal realm. Can you say amen? Amen. I
[1:30:55] thought of when Joseph was yet in Egypt,
[1:31:00] he told him, he said, "Now," he died,
[1:31:04] &gt;&gt; but he told him, he said, "Now,
[1:31:07] when you leave this place,
[1:31:09] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:31:10] &gt;&gt; you take my bones with you.
[1:31:11] &gt;&gt; Take them with you.
[1:31:12] &gt;&gt; Take them with you."
[1:31:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:14] &gt;&gt; I don't want to be here. I don't want to
[1:31:15] be left here.
[1:31:16] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:31:17] &gt;&gt; Now, think of that.
[1:31:20] Brother Bram said he believed that there
[1:31:21] would be a resurrection in the promised
[1:31:23] land.
[1:31:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. And he was looking for it.
[1:31:25] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[1:31:26] &gt;&gt; He was looking for it. So he said,
[1:31:28] "Don't you bury me here. Don't don't
[1:31:29] don't just leave me here. You You pick
[1:31:31] up my bones and you carry them with
[1:31:33] you."
[1:31:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:34] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:31:35] &gt;&gt; That's right. See, and brother Brandon
[1:31:36] said he wanted to make every testimony
[1:31:38] against the devil that he could.
[1:31:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:42] &gt;&gt; Yeah. He could have just sat there and
[1:31:43] said, "All right, just bury me and good
[1:31:45] luck, guys, and so long." But he wanted
[1:31:48] to make a testimony done to Satan
[1:31:50] against the devil. You take me with you
[1:31:53] because there's going to be a
[1:31:54] resurrection come in that promised land
[1:31:57] and the devil ain't going to be able to
[1:31:59] stop it.
[1:32:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:01] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:32:03] &gt;&gt; Now, brother Brandon made a statement
[1:32:04] and I really never thought of it, but he
[1:32:06] said there was a lot of others that died
[1:32:08] in Egypt. He wasn't the only one that
[1:32:10] died.
[1:32:11] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:32:12] &gt;&gt; There been 400 years in slavery.
[1:32:15] &gt;&gt; So, there was others that died, but he
[1:32:17] said, "You never hear one of them.
[1:32:22] saying, "Take my bones with you."
[1:32:24] &gt;&gt; Sure.
[1:32:26] &gt;&gt; There's going to be a resurrection. He
[1:32:28] said, "You never heard them. They just
[1:32:30] fell anywhere.
[1:32:32] &gt;&gt; They were buried there. They just
[1:32:34] buried. If they were buried over there,
[1:32:35] they were just buried."
[1:32:37] &gt;&gt; Ain't that right?
[1:32:39] &gt;&gt; He said anywhere was all right with
[1:32:41] them. They just fall anywhere. But not
[1:32:43] Joseph.
[1:32:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:45] &gt;&gt; He said there was something in him,
[1:32:47] something that had the same vision that
[1:32:49] Job had. the same vision the rest of
[1:32:52] them had. No matter what the rest of the
[1:32:54] world thought, what they' done, that had
[1:32:56] nothing to do with Joseph, that had
[1:32:58] nothing to do with Abraham, with Isaac,
[1:33:00] with Jacob, with all the rest of them.
[1:33:02] Something pressed to that promised land.
[1:33:06] &gt;&gt; Something fanatically, but they wanted
[1:33:08] it because there was something in them.
[1:33:11] And I have to tell you, church, there's
[1:33:13] something within every believer.
[1:33:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:15] &gt;&gt; There's something within every believer
[1:33:17] today that presses them to it. Prophet
[1:33:20] says, "No matter. You can try this,
[1:33:22] that, or the other, but there's
[1:33:23] something that presses. You know beyond
[1:33:25] a shadow of a doubt that there's a city
[1:33:27] whose builder and maker is God. You know
[1:33:29] that there's something there. So, you
[1:33:32] press,
[1:33:34] &gt;&gt; you press to it."
[1:33:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:37] &gt;&gt; The prophet said, "See, we believe it by
[1:33:40] faith and we feel." I want you to notice
[1:33:43] how he says this. We believe it by
[1:33:45] faith. We can't see it, but we just
[1:33:48] believe it by faith. And we feel from
[1:33:51] the other world the echoes of glory
[1:33:55] moving back into our souls, indicating
[1:33:58] it's true. It's true. Press on to the
[1:34:03] mark
[1:34:04] &gt;&gt; of the high calling.
[1:34:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:07] &gt;&gt; Do you feel that in your soul tonight?
[1:34:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:09] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:34:10] &gt;&gt; You may not see it.
[1:34:12] &gt;&gt; You may not see that new city. You may
[1:34:14] not see that new body. and all you look
[1:34:15] at is this old body.
[1:34:23] You may not see the things that we talk
[1:34:25] about,
[1:34:26] &gt;&gt; but there's something down in your soul
[1:34:28] that's testifying it's true.
[1:34:31] &gt;&gt; It's true. Press on
[1:34:34] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:34:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:36] &gt;&gt; Press on.
[1:34:38] &gt;&gt; I've got just a little bit of time. If
[1:34:41] Judith, if you'll play that tape. Last
[1:34:43] Sunday morning I was waking up early
[1:34:46] that was on Saturday this vision
[1:34:50] on always wearied
[1:34:54] I've always thought of dying at
[1:34:57] me being 50 it's my time is not didn't
[1:35:00] think was too long and I wonder why I
[1:35:04] would be in this theophony
[1:35:06] celestial body
[1:35:09] would it be that I'd see my precious
[1:35:11] friends and say a whites fog going by
[1:35:14] and say there goes brother Neville or he
[1:35:17] couldn't say hello brother Brandham and
[1:35:19] when Jesus come then I'd be man again
[1:35:23] I often thought that I was dreaming that
[1:35:26] I was out west and I coming down through
[1:35:29] a little sage brush place and my wife
[1:35:33] was with me and we'd been trout fishing
[1:35:35] and I stopped and and opened up the gate
[1:35:39] and the skies were so pretty. They
[1:35:42] didn't look like they do over the valley
[1:35:44] here. They were blue in the pretty white
[1:35:46] clouds.
[1:35:48] And I said to wife,
[1:35:51] I said, "We ought to have been out here
[1:35:52] a long time ago, honey." She said, "For
[1:35:55] the children's sake, we should have
[1:35:56] been, Billy."
[1:35:58] I said, "That's" and I woke up.
[1:36:01] I don't know, I'm screaming so much. I
[1:36:03] wonder why.
[1:36:05] And I looked down and she was laying by
[1:36:07] me. And I raised up on my pillow as many
[1:36:11] you people have done, put my head up on
[1:36:14] the the headboard of the bed and put my
[1:36:17] hands behind me. I was laying there like
[1:36:21] this and I said, "Well,
[1:36:25] I just wonder what it will be the other
[1:36:27] side.
[1:36:30] I am already 50 and I haven't done
[1:36:34] nothing yet.
[1:36:36] If I could only do something to help the
[1:36:38] Lord.
[1:36:40] For I know I won't be mortal.
[1:36:43] Half of my time is gone. At least or
[1:36:45] more than half. If I live to be as old
[1:36:48] as my people,
[1:36:50] still half my time is gone.
[1:36:53] And I looked around and I was laying
[1:36:56] there fixing to get up. It's about 7:00.
[1:36:58] I said, I believe I'll go down church
[1:37:01] this morning. If I am horse, I'd like to
[1:37:03] hear brother Neville preach.
[1:37:06] So I I said, "Are you awake, honey?" And
[1:37:09] she was sleeping very soundly.
[1:37:12] And
[1:37:15] I don't want you to miss this.
[1:37:19] It has changed me.
[1:37:22] I can't be the same brother of Brandon
[1:37:24] that I was.
[1:37:29] And I looked
[1:37:31] and I heard something kept saying,
[1:37:35] "You're just starting. Press the
[1:37:37] battle."
[1:37:40] &gt;&gt; Just keep pressing.
[1:37:41] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:37:43] &gt;&gt; I shook my head a minute. I thought,
[1:37:45] well, I probably just thinking like
[1:37:48] this, you know, your persons can get
[1:37:49] some imaginations. And I said, I just
[1:37:53] probably imagine that. It said, "Press
[1:37:56] the battle. Keep going. Keep going.
[1:38:02] &gt;&gt; I said maybe I said it.
[1:38:04] And I put my lips within my teeth and
[1:38:07] put my hand over my mouth.
[1:38:10] And there it come again. Said just keep
[1:38:13] pressing. If you only knew what was at
[1:38:17] the end of the road.
[1:38:22] And it seemed like I could hear Grim
[1:38:24] Snelling or somebody that sang that song
[1:38:27] like this. He sings at your anime and
[1:38:30] all of you all.
[1:38:33] I'm home sick and blue
[1:38:37] and I want to see Jesus.
[1:38:40] I would like to hear those sweet harbor
[1:38:43] bells chime.
[1:38:46] It would brighten my path and would
[1:38:48] vanish all fears.
[1:38:51] Lord, let me look past the curtain of
[1:38:54] time.
[1:38:56] &gt;&gt; You've heard it saying here at the
[1:38:58] church.
[1:39:00] &gt;&gt; And I heard something say, "Would you
[1:39:02] like to see just beyond the curtain?"
[1:39:06] I said, "It would help me so much."
[1:39:10] And I looked in just a moment. I one
[1:39:13] breath I'd come into a little place that
[1:39:16] slanted. I looked back and there I was
[1:39:19] laying on the bed.
[1:39:22] And I said, "This is a strange thing."
[1:39:26] Now, I would not want you to repeat
[1:39:28] this. This is before my church
[1:39:32] or my sheep that I am pastoring.
[1:39:36] Whether it was I was in this body or
[1:39:38] out, whether it was a translation,
[1:39:41] it wasn't like any vision I ever had.
[1:39:45] I could look there and I could look
[1:39:46] here. And when I hit that little place,
[1:39:50] I'd never seen so many people
[1:39:54] come running, screaming,
[1:39:57] "Oh, our precious brother."
[1:40:01] And I looked and young women
[1:40:05] maybe in their early 20s, 18 to 20. They
[1:40:09] were throwing their arms around me and
[1:40:13] screaming our precious brother. Here
[1:40:16] come young man
[1:40:18] in the brilliance of young manhood.
[1:40:22] And their eyes glistening and looking
[1:40:25] like stars on a darkened night. their
[1:40:29] teeth as white as pearl.
[1:40:32] And they were screaming and grabbing me
[1:40:34] and screaming, "Oh, our precious
[1:40:38] brother."
[1:40:41] And I stopped and I looked and I was
[1:40:44] young.
[1:40:46] I looked back at my old body laying
[1:40:48] there with my hands behind my head
[1:40:52] and I said, "I don't understand this."
[1:40:56] and these young women throwing their
[1:40:57] arms around me.
[1:41:00] Now I do realize this is a mixed
[1:41:02] audience and I say this with the
[1:41:05] sweetness and with the mellaness of the
[1:41:07] spirit.
[1:41:10] Man cannot put your arm around women
[1:41:12] without uh a human sensation
[1:41:16] but it wasn't there.
[1:41:21] &gt;&gt; There was no yesterday or tomorrow.
[1:41:25] They didn't get tired. They were I never
[1:41:28] seen such pretty women in all my life.
[1:41:32] They had hair way down to their
[1:41:34] waistline,
[1:41:35] long skirts to their feet. And they were
[1:41:39] just a hugging me. It wasn't a hug like
[1:41:41] even my own sister sitting there would
[1:41:43] have hugged me. They were not kissing me
[1:41:46] and I was not kissing them.
[1:41:48] It was something that I I have not got
[1:41:52] the the vocabulary. I haven't got the
[1:41:55] words to say. Perfection wouldn't touch
[1:41:58] it. Suburb wouldn't even touch it
[1:42:01] nowhere. It was something that I never
[1:42:04] You just have to be there.
[1:42:07] And I looked this way and that way and
[1:42:09] they weren't coming by the thousands.
[1:42:13] And I said, "I
[1:42:15] don't understand this.
[1:42:18] I said, "Well, they and here come hope."
[1:42:22] That was my first wife.
[1:42:25] She run and never said, "My husband."
[1:42:29] She said, "My precious brother."
[1:42:32] &gt;&gt; And when she hugged me,
[1:42:35] there was another woman standing there
[1:42:37] that hugged me. And then Hope hugged
[1:42:39] this woman
[1:42:42] and each one and I thought, "Oh, this
[1:42:45] has to be something different." It it
[1:42:47] can't be. There's something. I thought,
[1:42:50] "Oh, would I ever want to go back to
[1:42:52] that old carcass again?"
[1:42:55] I looked around there and I thought,
[1:42:56] "What is this?"
[1:42:59] And I looked real good and I
[1:43:02] I said, "I I can't understand this, but
[1:43:05] hope seemed to be like
[1:43:07] uh oh, a guest of honor."
[1:43:12] She was no different, but just like a
[1:43:13] guest of honor.
[1:43:16] And I heard a voice there that spoke to
[1:43:18] me that was in the room said, "This is
[1:43:21] what you preach was the Holy Ghost.
[1:43:24] This is perfect love
[1:43:29] &gt;&gt; and nothing can enter here without it.
[1:43:34] I am more determined than ever in my
[1:43:36] life
[1:43:38] that it takes perfect love to enter
[1:43:41] there.
[1:43:43] &gt;&gt; There was no jealousy. There was no
[1:43:46] tiredness. There was no death. Sickness
[1:43:49] could never end there. Mortality could
[1:43:51] could never make you old. And they could
[1:43:55] not cry. It was just one joy. Oh, my
[1:43:58] precious brother. And they took me up
[1:44:01] and set me up on a great big high place.
[1:44:05] &gt;&gt; And I thought, I am not dreaming. I'm
[1:44:07] looking back at my my body laying down
[1:44:09] on the bed.
[1:44:12] And it set me up there. And I said, "Oh,
[1:44:14] I shouldn't sit up here." And here come
[1:44:17] women and man from both sides just in
[1:44:19] the bloom of youth screaming.
[1:44:22] And one woman was standing there and she
[1:44:25] screamed, "Oh, my precious brother.
[1:44:30] Oh, we are so happy to see you here."
[1:44:36] I said, I don't understand this. And
[1:44:38] then that voice that was speaking from
[1:44:40] above me said you know it is written in
[1:44:43] the Bible that the prophets were
[1:44:45] gathered with their people.
[1:44:49] &gt;&gt; And I said yes I remember that in the
[1:44:52] scriptures said but this is when you
[1:44:55] will gather with your people.
[1:44:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:58] &gt;&gt; I said then they'll be real and I can
[1:45:01] feel them. Oh yes.
[1:45:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:04] &gt;&gt; I said but I there's a millions. there's
[1:45:07] not that many Brandhams. And that voice
[1:45:10] said, "They're not Brandoms.
[1:45:12] Them's your converts."
[1:45:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:16] &gt;&gt; That's the ones that you've led to the
[1:45:17] Lord.
[1:45:19] &gt;&gt; And said some of them women there that
[1:45:20] you think is so beautiful were better
[1:45:22] than 90 years old when you led them to
[1:45:25] the Lord. No wonder they're screaming
[1:45:28] our precious brother. And they screamed
[1:45:31] all at once that if you hadn't have
[1:45:32] went, we wouldn't be here. Amen.
[1:45:36] &gt;&gt; I looked around. I thought, "Well, I
[1:45:38] don't get it." I said, "Oh, where is
[1:45:41] Jesus? I want to see him so bad." They
[1:45:45] said, "Now, he's just a little higher
[1:45:48] right up that way." Said, "Someday he
[1:45:52] will come to you." She said, "You were
[1:45:54] sent for a leader
[1:45:56] &gt;&gt; and God will come and when he does,
[1:45:58] he'll judge you according to what you
[1:46:01] taught them
[1:46:03] &gt;&gt; first. whether they go in or not,
[1:46:07] &gt;&gt; we'll go in according to your teaching.
[1:46:10] &gt;&gt; I said, "Oh, I'm so glad.
[1:46:14] If Paul, does he have to stand like
[1:46:16] this? Does Peter have to stand like
[1:46:18] this?" Yes. I said, "Then I preached
[1:46:22] every word that they preached. I never
[1:46:25] did it from it one side to the other."
[1:46:29] &gt;&gt; Were they baptized in the name of Jesus
[1:46:31] Christ? I did, too. where they taught
[1:46:33] the baptism of the Holy Ghost. I did
[1:46:35] too. Whatever they taught, I did too.
[1:46:38] &gt;&gt; And then people screamed and said, "We
[1:46:40] know that and we know we're going with
[1:46:42] you someday back to earth."
[1:46:45] &gt;&gt; Said, "Jesus will come and you'll be
[1:46:48] judged according to the word that you
[1:46:50] preached us." And then if you are
[1:46:54] accepted at that time which you will be
[1:46:56] and said then you will present us to him
[1:47:00] as your trophies of your ministry.
[1:47:03] &gt;&gt; Said you will guide us to him and all
[1:47:07] together we'll go back to the earth to
[1:47:10] live forever.
[1:47:14] &gt;&gt; I said do I have to return back now?
[1:47:17] &gt;&gt; Yes. But keep pressing on.
[1:47:21] Amen.
[1:47:22] &gt;&gt; I looked and I could see the people just
[1:47:24] as far as I could see still coming
[1:47:27] wanting to hug me, screaming, our
[1:47:29] precious brother, just a voice said,
[1:47:32] "All
[1:47:33] that you ever loved.
[1:47:36] And all that ever loved you,
[1:47:40] God has given you here."
[1:47:43] &gt;&gt; And I looked and here come old dog come
[1:47:46] walking up. Here come my horse and laid
[1:47:49] his head up over my shoulder. knickered
[1:47:52] said, "All that you ever loved and all
[1:47:56] that ever loved you, God has given them
[1:48:00] into your hands
[1:48:03] &gt;&gt; through your ministry
[1:48:06] and I felt myself move from that
[1:48:09] beautiful place
[1:48:11] [Music]
[1:48:12] and I looked around.
[1:48:14] &gt;&gt; I said, "Are you awake, honey?" She's
[1:48:17] still asleep. And I thought, "Oh God,
[1:48:21] oh help me. Oh God, never let me
[1:48:25] compromise with one word. Let me stay
[1:48:28] right straight on that word and preach
[1:48:30] it. I don't care what comes or goes,
[1:48:32] what anybody does, how many Sauls of
[1:48:36] sons of Kish rise, how many this that or
[1:48:38] the other. Let me Lord press to that
[1:48:42] place.
[1:48:46] all fear of death.
[1:48:48] I say this with my Bible before me this
[1:48:51] morning. I've got a little boy there at
[1:48:53] four years old to be raised. I got a
[1:48:55] nineyear-old girl and a teenager
[1:48:58] that I'm thankful for that's turned the
[1:49:01] way of the Lord.
[1:49:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:04] &gt;&gt; God, let me live to
[1:49:07] bring them up in the admonition of God.
[1:49:11] And above that, the whole world seems to
[1:49:14] scream to me.
[1:49:17] 90 year old women and men and all kinds.
[1:49:21] If you hadn't have went, we wouldn't
[1:49:23] been here.
[1:49:25] &gt;&gt; God, let me press the battle.
[1:49:28] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:49:29] &gt;&gt; But if it comes to dying, I am no more.
[1:49:32] Uh it would be a joy. It would be a
[1:49:36] pleasure
[1:49:38] &gt;&gt; to enter from this corruption and
[1:49:41] disgrace.
[1:49:43] If I could make up yonder 100 billion
[1:49:47] miles high,
[1:49:49] a square block, and that's perfect love.
[1:49:52] Each step this way, it narrows
[1:49:55] until we get down to where we are now.
[1:49:59] It would be just merely a shadow of
[1:50:02] corruption.
[1:50:03] That little something that we can sense
[1:50:06] and feel that there's something
[1:50:08] somewhere. We don't know what it is. Oh
[1:50:12] my precious friend.
[1:50:15] &gt;&gt; Hey,
[1:50:17] &gt;&gt; my beloved, my darlings of the gospel,
[1:50:22] my begotten children unto God. Listen to
[1:50:26] me, your pastor.
[1:50:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. you. I wish there was some way I
[1:50:31] could explain it to you.
[1:50:34] There's no words. I couldn't find it.
[1:50:37] It's not found anywhere. But just beyond
[1:50:40] this last breath is the most glorious
[1:50:43] thing that you ever There is no way to
[1:50:47] explain it. There's no way. I just can't
[1:50:50] do it.
[1:50:52] But whatever you do, friend, lay aside
[1:50:55] everything else till you get perfect
[1:50:58] love.
[1:51:00] &gt;&gt; Get to a spot that you can love
[1:51:02] everybody, every enemy, everything else.
[1:51:07] &gt;&gt; That one visit there to me has made me a
[1:51:10] different man.
[1:51:11] I can never never never be the same
[1:51:14] brother Brandham that I was.
[1:51:18] &gt;&gt; Whether the planes are rocking, whether
[1:51:20] the lightnings are flashing,
[1:51:23] whether the spies has a gun on me,
[1:51:25] whatever it is, it doesn't matter. I'm
[1:51:28] going to press the battle by the grace
[1:51:30] of God.
[1:51:31] &gt;&gt; Well, I preach the gospel to every
[1:51:33] creature and every person that I can,
[1:51:36] persuading them
[1:51:38] &gt;&gt; to that beautiful land on earth.
[1:51:43] Amen.
