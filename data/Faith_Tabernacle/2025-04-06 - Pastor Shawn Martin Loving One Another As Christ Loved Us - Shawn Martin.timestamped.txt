[18:47] prayers uh with her knees that the Lord
[18:50] would just go and and touch her. Also,
[18:53] we want to keep Brother Tim in our

[18:57] let's remember him this morning. And um
[19:00] Amen. How many has an unspoken request
[19:02] by lift your hands? Amen. Maybe we could
[19:05] ask brother Amos if he would come and
[19:06] lead us this morning. Let's remember our
[19:09] pastor that the Lord would just use him
[19:11] in a special way.
[19:18] Amen. There's many needs among us that
[19:21] sometimes go
[19:23] unmentioned. Let's pray for one another
[19:25] as well. Heavenly Father God, we want to
[19:30] thank you God for this morning, Father
[19:32] God. And we thank you that it is morning
[19:35] as your prophet said, "Good morning,
[19:38] friends." Oh God, truly it is the
[19:40] morning, the dawning of a new day for
[19:42] the bride of Jesus Christ. Lord, it's a
[19:45] constant going forward and rising of the
[19:48] sun, dear God. Oh dear Lord, while the
[19:51] rest of the world is groping in darkness
[19:54] all around them, Father God, Lord, and
[19:56] they don't have no light, there's more
[19:59] than just a light and go. There is the
[20:02] full light of the hour, Father God, to
[20:04] lead us and guide us, Lord. We're not
[20:07] working with working under the light of
[20:09] a candle. We're not working under the
[20:11] light of an artificial light, but we're
[20:14] working by the light of the pillar of
[20:16] fire. God, thank you, Father God, for
[20:18] being within us, oh God, Lord, in this
[20:21] hour, Lord. We know, Lord, God, we thank
[20:25] you for so much that you've done for us,
[20:27] Lord, and hearing and answering prayers,
[20:30] dear God. Though Satan has fought us on
[20:33] the left and on the right, yet we've
[20:36] come out victorious, dear Lord. Many
[20:39] have overcome illness. They've overcome
[20:42] this. They've overcome sin of various
[20:45] types of unbelief. Oh God, come into the
[20:48] fullness of the word of the hour, Lord.
[20:51] And no doubt there's some here this
[20:52] morning, Lord, as was mentioned, dear
[20:55] God, some requests, oh God, you know all
[20:58] about each and every upraised hand.
[21:00] Lord, we pray for one another, dear God.
[21:03] We we're not standing alone, but we
[21:06] stand united as a body of Christ. We're
[21:09] pleading the blood over our hearts and
[21:12] lives, our bodies, our spirits. Oh God,
[21:15] we ask it God that you would have your
[21:17] way. Each and every one of these
[21:19] requests, Lord, some are in dire
[21:21] straits. Lord, in their bodies, oh God,
[21:24] they're fighting in battle and pain and
[21:27] suffering, dear God, and much
[21:30] discomfort, Lord, you understand all
[21:33] that, Lord. Father God, though that be
[21:36] going on, faith is not diminished. God,
[21:38] we've cast all of our care upon you this
[21:41] morning. May you bless the word as it
[21:43] comes forth. We pray in Jesus' name.
[21:47] Amen.
[21:50] I've known you as my
[21:52] friend and I have lived in the goodness
[21:58] of
[21:59] God.
[22:01] Oh, and all my life you can you just
[22:05] worship him this
[22:07] morning. Yeah. And all my life you have
[22:12] been so so
[22:16] good with every breath that I am
[22:21] able. Oh, I will sing of the goodness of
[22:26] God. One more time as brother Doug
[22:28] comes.
[22:30] Oh, and all my life you have been
[22:36] faithful, Lord. All my life you have
[22:40] been so so
[22:44] good with every breath that I am
[22:49] able. For I will sing of the goodness of
[22:55] God.
[22:58] I will sing of the goodness of
[23:03] God. Amen. You can be seated.

[32:03] with the people of God. And
[32:08] um the musicians can be dismissed and
[32:12] and um if you would like to turn with me
[32:15] to the book of Ephesians, the fifth
[32:17] chapter.
[32:20] And
[32:21] um praise the Lord. It's
[32:25] um good to have brother Shine, sister
[32:29] Bethany back. Amen. With us together and
[32:33] a little guy. He's uh he just dressed
[32:36] cute there.
[32:39] And u um
[32:42] uh but also the Lord willing uh we will
[32:46] be setting up the tent next Sunday
[32:48] afternoon after the morning service and
[32:53] um um so any of you brothers and sisters
[32:59] whoever would want to help um more than
[33:02] welcome to and um looking forward to
[33:07] what God's got in store for us uh this
[33:11] meeting. It's uh the year's gone by so
[33:13] fast and as it always does and but uh
[33:18] just looking for great things in the
[33:20] Lord. And but may we just bow our heads
[33:23] in a word of prayer and just talk to our
[33:27] father.
[33:29] Precious Lord,
[33:31] it's what an honor it is to be able to
[33:34] call you our
[33:36] father, Lord, and to know you in that
[33:41] way. Not only just savior and redeemer,
[33:44] but to know you as kin, Lord, that we're
[33:48] part of you. We're all your
[33:51] offsprings. We have your life within us,
[33:54] your blood flowing in our veins.
[33:57] And Lord, the what you are is what we
[34:02] are. And we're so thankful, Lord, for
[34:05] that. And it's just a paradox, Lord.
[34:08] Then the world don't understand. And
[34:12] sometimes maybe we have a hard time
[34:15] understanding just really who we are.
[34:17] But Father, that's your desire is for
[34:20] you, for us to know what we are in you.
[34:25] We just ask that you would minister to
[34:27] us now. Lord, help me to get myself out
[34:30] of the way to yield to you. And Father,
[34:34] bless your people today. Father, speak
[34:37] to them, Lord. And may we just be drawn
[34:41] closer to you, Father. That's our
[34:45] prayer. I believe that's the desire of
[34:48] everyone here this morning is just to
[34:51] have a closer walk with you to reflect
[34:54] you even more than we ever have. And I
[34:58] know Lord that you will grant it to us.
[35:01] We ask in Jesus Christ's name. And the
[35:04] church says
[35:06] amen and amen. the um the book of
[35:10] Ephesians, the fifth chapter. And we're
[35:12] going to read the the first two verses
[35:16] here, but it says, "Be ye therefore
[35:19] followers of God as dear
[35:24] children, and walk in love as Christ
[35:27] also hath loved us, and hath given
[35:29] himself for us, an offering, and a
[35:32] sacrifice to God for a sweet
[35:36] smelling Savior." Amen.
[35:40] You can have your seats this morning.
[35:44] And um I guess if I would use a title,
[35:48] it would be loving one another as Christ
[35:51] loved
[35:52] us. And um of course we've spoken on
[35:55] love. Maybe same topic, different title
[36:00] uh there, but um
[36:03] um we were reading there. We read from
[36:06] the book of
[36:07] Ephesians and the the book of Ephesians
[36:11] means a lot to us uh those who are
[36:14] believers in the message. Um because uh
[36:19] brother Brham um uh put the book as a
[36:24] personal
[36:25] um book for the believer and uh
[36:29] enlightened us that um uh it the the
[36:33] book of Ephesians is actually for our
[36:36] day and our time. And u of course when
[36:40] you look in the the the first part of
[36:43] the the book it Paul writes it to the
[36:48] not only to the saints in Ephesus but he
[36:50] says but also to the faithful in Christ
[36:53] Jesus. So then this isn't written to
[36:57] sinners or make believers. Um
[37:00] uh it it it's it's written to those who
[37:04] are in Christ. Brother Brandham tells us
[37:07] that the book of Ephesians parallels the
[37:10] book of Joshua and it deals with uh uh
[37:14] the second part of redemption uh which
[37:18] that's where we're at today. Uh is is
[37:22] the second part and that's uh the first
[37:25] part of redemption was coming out of
[37:27] Egypt. Second part of redemption was
[37:29] going into the promised land. And and so
[37:33] uh uh but why why would God take uh
[37:37] Israel out of Egypt? Why? Just to wander
[37:41] around uh and and you know uh those that
[37:46] did not, you know, out of out of the two
[37:48] and a half million that that left the
[37:50] the the Egypt, only two, the prophet
[37:53] said, knew what it was all about. the
[37:56] others just they didn't have a purpose.
[37:59] They they thought, well, maybe we're
[38:02] just to live out here, you know, and and
[38:04] they really couldn't see what God was
[38:07] trying to do, but Joshua and Caleb did.
[38:10] So, so God takes Israel out of Egypt to
[38:15] positionally place them in the promised
[38:18] land. They had to journey uh through the
[38:22] the the wilderness and they had to pass
[38:25] uh through uh the land of the Moabites
[38:29] and u uh you know Esau's land and and
[38:33] different things, you know, but that
[38:35] wasn't their
[38:37] inheritance. God had to bring them into
[38:40] the place of their inheritance,
[38:43] a place that rightfully belonged to
[38:45] them. and it was given to them by
[38:48] promise. Can you say amen? Now, so this
[38:51] is what the book of Joshua deals with
[38:54] them going into the promised land and
[38:57] Joshua positionally placing them. And so
[39:01] u uh we find that God took us out of the
[39:05] world. He took us out of denominations.
[39:08] He He's all done this. But but why would
[39:11] he do that? just for us to be religious
[39:15] and church members and all these things.
[39:18] No, but it's to positionally place us in
[39:22] our inheritance. Do you believe that?
[39:25] And so uh uh to bring us what uh into
[39:28] the place of what rightfully belongs to
[39:30] us by promise. And so um so the book of
[39:35] Ephesians deals with the church being
[39:38] positionally placed in the the land of
[39:41] inheritance and it's setting the church
[39:44] in her place. Amen. And this is what is
[39:47] taking place today is we're being
[39:50] positionally placed in the land. No
[39:53] wandering, not not not going through
[39:56] somebody else's land and and and not
[39:59] conquering. that this is the time to
[40:01] conquer because we are in our land. And
[40:05] and if we could understand that that we
[40:08] are not victims, we are overcomers.
[40:11] Amen. When they got into that promised
[40:13] land, Amen. they they changed from
[40:16] wandering to overcoming. Amen. And so uh
[40:21] we we see that the message has
[40:24] positionally placed uh each each each
[40:28] age in the word for their day. And by
[40:32] the message then we also see that we are
[40:35] in the capstone age. We are in the
[40:39] finishing age. We are in the age of
[40:42] completion. It's the finale of it all.
[40:46] There's no more other ages. There's no
[40:48] more other uh time except the eternal
[40:51] age, brother Bram talked about. And so
[40:54] uh uh we're we're positionally placed in
[40:57] the word in the word for our day. How
[41:00] many believes that? Amen. And so uh
[41:03] through the ages, the church has
[41:05] developed from the feet and and and has
[41:09] been developing God developing the
[41:11] church all the way to the head. And and
[41:14] we're we're in the head age. It's the
[41:17] head age that we're living in. Not the
[41:19] feet age, not the leg age. Uh uh all
[41:22] these things. And Christ, everybody say
[41:25] Christ. Christ Christ is the head. Amen.
[41:29] And remember, brother Bram talked about
[41:31] how that you can actually mix u uh and I
[41:34] can't remember the deer or the the type
[41:36] of deers and or sheep or but he says
[41:39] there's two animals that if you look at
[41:41] their hindsight uh behinds or whatever
[41:45] uh you get them mixed up. But he says to
[41:47] to get them what they are, uh he said
[41:51] you let them turn around and you see the
[41:54] difference by their head, uh their
[41:57] characteristics and things like that.
[41:59] Well, that's the deception has been
[42:02] great and and all of these things, but
[42:04] the the the bride is actually being
[42:08] identified by her headship. Amen. Her
[42:11] head. Do you believe that? And so, uh,
[42:14] Brother Brham said, "The little church
[42:16] that's come along also, Christ word
[42:19] bride down through the age is coming to
[42:21] a head cuz she's going to be united back
[42:24] to its mate." Amen. See, always, just
[42:28] like the church and everything else,
[42:30] it's got to unite. How many believes
[42:32] that? Got to unite. Christ and his
[42:35] brides got to unite. And Christ is the
[42:38] word. See, so always just like the
[42:40] church and everything else, it's got to
[42:42] unite. The wheat, everything else comes
[42:45] right back to its head where it started
[42:47] from like Cain and Abel, word bride,
[42:50] heading up in the person of the word of
[42:52] God made manifest in this evil age that
[42:55] we're living in. So, the promise that
[42:57] had been laying there in the book of
[42:59] Psalms thousands of years ago, uh, but a
[43:03] promise was laying there, and we've read
[43:06] it before, but Psalms
[43:08] 102:16, it says, "When the Lord shall
[43:10] build up Zion, the bride, the church,
[43:14] his bride." Amen. He shall appear in his
[43:19] glory. And and so brother Brandham says
[43:22] now as we grow from the Lutheran age and
[43:24] Baptist age, Methodist age, Pentecostal
[43:27] age, we're right up to the capping stone
[43:30] now, waiting and longing for that
[43:33] capping stone to set down. The buildings
[43:36] complete. Can you say amen? See, so
[43:39] we're in that capstone age. Amen. And
[43:43] not having to go back and redo Luther's
[43:45] work and Wesley's and and all that.
[43:48] That's that has nothing to do with us.
[43:50] That was part of the the body, but we're
[43:53] in a in a capstone age where it's Christ
[43:57] himself. Luther didn't have what it took
[43:59] to bring a rapture and to perfect the
[44:01] church. And Wesley in the Pentecostal
[44:04] age didn't have what it took, amen, to
[44:07] uh uh to to bring on a rapture and to
[44:10] perfect the church. Do you believe that?
[44:13] So, brother Brandham in another place
[44:15] says, "Now down through the age, we
[44:16] started off from the foundation from the
[44:19] first church age. When the seed went in
[44:21] the ground, the complete seed, then it
[44:23] come out through the feet, Luther out uh
[44:26] come back out then through Wesley and
[44:29] then into Pentecostals, tongues and the
[44:31] lips, and now it's in the eyes prophetic
[44:33] of Malachi 4 and so forth. And now
[44:36] there's nothing else left for it to come
[44:39] but him himself to step into that cuz
[44:43] that's the last thing there is. Well,
[44:45] that's the token that brother Brand
[44:46] tells us that we must have. Can you say
[44:49] amen? Not an emotion, not an excitement,
[44:52] not not a feeling, but the life Christ
[44:56] himself, the person of Jesus Christ. And
[44:59] and and so in the latter part of brother
[45:01] Bram's ministry, you know, he's hitting
[45:03] that token, the token, the life. Amen.
[45:06] And and these things. I'm coming to
[45:09] something here in a minute. But we we
[45:12] find that there are more scriptures that
[45:14] talk about this second coming of Christ
[45:17] than it does the first coming of Christ.
[45:20] Amen. Brother Brandham says that. See?
[45:22] And so uh uh if if you notice that
[45:26] Israel, as Israel had to have a
[45:28] vindicated leader, prophet, amen, to
[45:32] take them over into the promised land,
[45:35] so does the church of this day have to
[45:38] have a
[45:39] vindicated prophet to lead us into our
[45:44] spiritual land of promise. And brother
[45:47] Brandham said Joshua in Hebrews means
[45:49] savior and represents the promised
[45:52] endtime leader to take the church over.
[45:55] Can you say amen? So there should be no
[45:57] question what this message means to us.
[46:00] You cannot get into that promised land
[46:03] without the message. You cannot be
[46:05] positionally placed in the word without
[46:07] the message. Can you say amen? Amen.
[46:10] That's right. See, it's the message that
[46:13] God has given us and it's grace. It's a
[46:16] sign of grace to us that God would place
[46:20] us in in in in in a uh in strategically
[46:24] to be able to hear a prophet. Amen. And
[46:26] and to believe the prophet's words and
[46:29] and and let it affect us. Can you say
[46:32] amen? So, Brother Brandham's ministry is
[46:35] likened to that Joshua ministry for
[46:37] today. And and brother Brandham talked
[46:40] about the three pools, first, second,
[46:42] and third. And the third pool is where
[46:46] all the promises of God lay. The third
[46:50] pool is where all the promises lay. Now,
[46:54] uh uh in
[46:57] 1961, Brother Brandon told of the vision
[46:59] that he had. He said it was about 3:00
[47:02] in the morning. He said, "I suppose."
[47:04] And I'd gotten up and I looked where in
[47:06] front of me I was coming down to the
[47:09] Jordan. looked like I was um standing on
[47:13] the map of Palestine and I was coming
[47:15] down to the Jordan. It seemed like I
[47:17] could hear the song. I'm going down to
[47:20] the Jordan. Someone was singing it. And
[47:22] as I drew near the river, I looked back
[47:25] and seen which way I had come. And I was
[47:28] 2third of the way there to this Jordan.
[47:32] So, he's already come first, second
[47:36] pull. He's up now to the River Jordan.
[47:39] Amen. Just just like Joshua when they
[47:42] come up to that river Jordan and over
[47:44] there, Amen. was the promised land was
[47:47] the promises. Amen. So they had to cross
[47:49] over. Ain't that right? Which Jordan
[47:52] means death, dying out to self. Ain't
[47:55] that right? And he says, I looked across
[47:58] Jordan. I said, oh, praise God. Just on
[48:01] the other side is where all the promises
[48:04] lay. Every promise lays in the promised
[48:08] land. Can you say amen? Not in the first
[48:11] pool. Not in the second pool. Amen.
[48:14] Brother Bram tells us the first and
[48:16] second pool was only just to catch the
[48:18] people's attention trying to catch the
[48:20] and it only was catching the little fish
[48:22] only drawing the little fish was chasing
[48:25] at. Amen. It was the the if I would say
[48:28] it this way, it was the rainbow trout,
[48:29] you know, or whatever that was after
[48:31] that third pull. Amen. That's what was
[48:34] catching the brides. Got the the bride
[48:37] hooked. Ain't that right? So, he he had
[48:40] already come twothirds of the way. And
[48:42] and and uh uh but it's in that third
[48:45] pool is where all the promises lay. And
[48:49] notice brother Brandham identified that
[48:51] third pool as being the opening of the
[48:54] word. Amen. Not not a creed being taught
[48:57] us, not a doctrine just being taught us,
[49:00] not traditions being taught us, and not
[49:03] the old old ways of life being taught
[49:05] us. A new way of life, the promises. Can
[49:10] you say amen? When they got into the
[49:12] promised land, remember the old mana
[49:14] ceased and they ate off the new corn of
[49:17] the land. They all ate off of a new
[49:20] diet. Can you say amen? Well, that's
[49:22] what this message is. It's a new diet
[49:25] for us. We we can't live off Pentecostal
[49:28] food and and and Baptist message and and
[49:32] Lutheran message. This is a totally new
[49:34] diet for those that come into the
[49:37] promised land. This is why we love the
[49:40] message of the hour. We don't want
[49:42] nothing else but this message. Can you
[49:45] say amen? It's and and it's revelation
[49:48] to us. Amen. Brother Brham said it
[49:50] become a new book and and it's be it's a
[49:53] this is a new book to every one of us
[49:56] that has come into the opening of the
[49:58] word. But see so so uh uh we know by the
[50:02] message of the hour that the third pool
[50:04] is only for the elect. Amen. It's it's
[50:07] only for the elect. And and and the the
[50:11] first and second pool that wasn't for
[50:13] us. That was the prophet's ministry.
[50:15] Jesus had the first and second pull not
[50:17] the disciples. It it was it was it was
[50:20] Jesus. But it it's and we're we weren't
[50:23] part of that. And if and that's just my
[50:26] understanding of it. But it's that third
[50:29] pool that we're part of. It's that third
[50:31] pool that identifies us as the bride of
[50:34] Jesus Christ. See? So, so um not
[50:38] emotions, not gifts, not sensation, but
[50:42] the revealed word of God. That's where
[50:45] the promises lay in the revealed word of
[50:48] God. And Christ is the word. Do you
[50:52] believe that? And the Bible says that
[50:54] every promise in him is yay and amen.
[50:59] Not in the church, in him. Not even in a
[51:03] prophet. In
[51:05] him, Christ. Can you say amen? Amen. The
[51:09] message. Amen. And they cannot fail. So,
[51:13] how do we get into him? Amen. By one
[51:16] spirit are we all baptized into one
[51:19] body. We're baptized into Christ. It's
[51:23] not a water baptism. It's a spiritual
[51:26] baptism. Ain't that right? Spirit
[51:29] baptism. And this baptism isn't the
[51:33] spirit just falling on your flesh. Amen.
[51:36] To where you have a religious thought
[51:38] every now and again. Amen. This this
[51:42] isn't this spirit baptism isn't the
[51:45] spirit just anointing your spirit to
[51:48] where you have some sensation or feeling
[51:51] or to where you have a nice dream or you
[51:54] speak in tongues and you prophesy and
[51:57] and and you you're in that realm and and
[52:00] that anything in that realm has to be
[52:02] tested. It has to be proven. Amen.
[52:05] Because Satan can get on your spirit and
[52:07] Satan can get on your flesh and he he
[52:10] well you you know what brother Bram
[52:11] taught about these things. See and and
[52:14] so but this spirit baptism isn't just
[52:16] resting on your flesh or anointing your
[52:18] spirit but this baptism is the spirit
[52:22] coming into your soul and quickening the
[52:26] word and giving you a word birth. Can
[52:29] you say amen? It quickens that word gene
[52:33] seed inside of you. Now, that's the real
[52:36] you. Amen. If if the if the spirit comes
[52:39] and anoints your flesh, amen, you're
[52:42] still dead. You're you're still in in
[52:44] trespasses and sins and you're still in
[52:47] that way. And if the if the if the
[52:50] spirit comes and anoints your spirit to
[52:52] where you prophesy and you speak in
[52:54] tongues and all that. Well, there I've
[52:56] seen it in in in the Pentecostal times
[52:59] where where people do that and still go
[53:01] out and drink and smoke and I mean that
[53:04] that's uh that's so much in the
[53:06] Pentecostals and all that uh uh because
[53:09] that doesn't give you a word birth. It
[53:11] has to come down into your soul to
[53:14] change you. Can you say amen? And that's
[53:17] the real you. That's the real you is
[53:20] when that the the spirit can come in and
[53:23] quicken that word seed. Can you say
[53:25] amen? You see, uh uh the real you, you
[53:29] know, you you may have been born a
[53:30] sinner and shaped in sin and all these
[53:33] things and we all were, but that wasn't
[53:35] the real us. Amen. See? Amen. That's
[53:38] right. See, the real you, the real you
[53:41] never did it in the first place. The
[53:43] real you. Amen. All sin is never
[53:46] attributed to you. Amen. That's what
[53:48] even the psalmist says. Blessed is the
[53:50] man to whom the Lord does not impute
[53:53] iniquity. Why? Because he's looking at
[53:56] the real you, a predestinated seed that
[53:59] God put in before the foundation of the
[54:02] world inside of you. Amen. So, yes, by
[54:05] your first birth, you were a sinner by
[54:07] nature, but the prophet said you were
[54:09] trapped into it. You you were trapped
[54:11] into sin. You were trapped. Amen. by
[54:14] your first birth, but the real you comes
[54:17] to life not by sexual birth. Amen. By
[54:20] but by a word birth, the second birth.
[54:23] Can you say amen? That's why Jesus said
[54:25] a man must be born again. And that's why
[54:28] Satan fights the new birth. Amen. He
[54:31] fights it with all that he's got. He's
[54:32] got people. He anoints them in their
[54:35] spirit and they and and they get to
[54:36] thinking that they've got something and
[54:39] and but yet the word has never come
[54:41] alive to them. Amen. But the the when
[54:44] you get that word birth, that second
[54:47] birth. Amen. See, and so it's by your
[54:50] second birth that Christ is able to have
[54:53] preeminence in your life. Amen. The word
[54:57] is now being able to have preeminence
[54:59] over you. Do you believe that? Amen.
[55:02] Faith becomes alive. Joy, peace,
[55:06] happiness. Something takes place in you
[55:09] that could not come to you by your
[55:12] natural birth. Oh yes, natural birth.
[55:14] You get excited. But what makes you
[55:16] excited? Sure. It ain't coming to church
[55:18] to hear the word of God. Amen. Maybe if
[55:20] they have a Christmas pageant or
[55:22] professional musicians and a
[55:24] professional preacher or movies movie
[55:27] night or or there there's so many out,
[55:30] you know, get the million dollars and
[55:32] and all that. You get excited over that.
[55:34] People cry and boo and and who and jump
[55:36] up and down over over natural things.
[55:39] But but that that doesn't mean nothing.
[55:42] But when you get a word birth, when that
[55:44] second birth comes, you get excited
[55:47] about the things of God. You get excited
[55:49] about the promises of God. Amen. When
[55:51] the promises are read from the book, you
[55:53] say, "That's mine. That's that's me."
[55:56] Amen. Why? Something has come alive in
[55:58] you. Amen. that that couldn't do that by
[56:01] your natural birth. Amen. The prophet
[56:03] even proh preached on it in the
[56:05] personation of Christianity. You can
[56:07] pretend to be a Christian. You can
[56:09] pretend to be right and all of these
[56:11] things, but there will be something that
[56:13] that that will never get you to that
[56:15] place. Amen. Until you get a real that
[56:19] second birth quickens that that real you
[56:24] inside of you. Amen. So by your second
[56:27] birth, Christ is able to have the
[56:29] preeminence.
[56:30] What is it? The word is now born inside
[56:34] of you, quickened in you, and now it's
[56:37] gaining control over you.
[56:40] You believe it? Watch. It's controlling
[56:43] your emotions. I know you know, you
[56:46] know, there's some that that just think,
[56:48] you know, that most message people are
[56:50] dead. Their churches are dead. That that
[56:53] ain't it. We get excited. I and I know
[56:56] there's that former side that they don't
[56:58] believe in nothing. And that's fine. I
[57:01] mean, that's between them and the Lord,
[57:02] but I I just know what brother Brown
[57:05] said. If you're, you know, if your
[57:06] religion isn't alive and kicking, then
[57:09] it's dead, you know. And we do get
[57:12] excited. But the word controls our
[57:14] emotions. The word controls your habits.
[57:18] The word is the word controls your
[57:21] lifestyle. Amen. Amen. The word controls
[57:24] your desires. Amen. There may be things
[57:26] in your life, but let the word of God
[57:28] hit it. It may hurt, but you say, "Man,
[57:31] that's right. I Oh, God, help me." Oh,
[57:34] it makes you desperate to to to get rid
[57:37] of them things because you want the word
[57:40] to have the preeminence in you. Now,
[57:42] what is it? That's the real you crying
[57:45] out for heavenly things. Can you say
[57:48] amen? Amen. the the the by your second
[57:51] birth, you wouldn't be interested in the
[57:53] promises of God. You wouldn't be
[57:55] interested in the things of God. Amen.
[57:58] But you get a second birth and you get
[58:00] that word birth in you. That's all you
[58:02] live for is to manifest Christ. Amen.
[58:06] That's your passion. Can you say amen?
[58:09] Now, we we find it's controlling. Now,
[58:12] the eagllet, brother Bram talks about
[58:14] that eagllet for a reason, you know, but
[58:16] but the eagllet was born in the chicken
[58:19] yard, right? He he wasn't born hatched
[58:23] where he originally came from. He was
[58:26] born in the chicken
[58:28] yard. He yet he didn't fit with the
[58:30] chickens.
[58:32] He he he didn't know who he was, but he
[58:35] didn't fit with the chickens, you know,
[58:37] and and you know, he might have tried to
[58:40] do it, but he didn't come from there. He
[58:44] didn't know he didn't come from there.
[58:47] He just thought something was different.
[58:49] He didn't understand why. He thought he
[58:52] was born. He thought he come from the
[58:54] from from the same the yard, a chicken
[58:57] pin and all that. He didn't have no idea
[59:01] that he came from another place. And and
[59:04] all he knew was just where he was. Ain't
[59:07] that right? See, so he could not tell
[59:09] you where he came from because he didn't
[59:11] know. All he could remember is being
[59:13] born in the chicken yard. All he was
[59:15] told is you were born in the chicken
[59:17] yard. Now straighten up and act like a
[59:19] chicken, you know. Well, he didn't know
[59:21] any other life than than chicken life.
[59:25] pecking and and and and eating chicken
[59:29] food and and all that. See, he didn't
[59:31] know the potentials that really laid in
[59:34] him. There was potentials in him that
[59:36] the chicken didn't have. He had real
[59:39] potentials. It wasn't impersonation. It
[59:42] wasn't in and trying to make up these
[59:44] potentials. They laid in him because of
[59:47] the place he came from.
[59:51] Amen. And yet he didn't fly out of the
[59:54] barnyard. He could have, but he didn't
[59:56] cuz he didn't know he could. That's
[59:58] right. He didn't know the potentials
[1:00:00] that was within him. Can you say amen?
[1:00:03] And and and yet the the the chickens
[1:00:06] couldn't help uh identify who he was.
[1:00:09] Amen. They were trying to make him fit,
[1:00:11] but he just didn't fit in with them.
[1:00:14] Amen. And yet he himself couldn't even
[1:00:17] find his own identity. He tried and and
[1:00:20] we've all done the same thing trying to
[1:00:22] fit in with this crowd and that crowd
[1:00:24] and this crowd and yet we couldn't find
[1:00:26] our own identity. But it took Mama
[1:00:28] Eagle, amen, to soar over and she began
[1:00:32] to cry. She began to scream. She began
[1:00:35] to proclaim the word. Can you say amen?
[1:00:38] Amen. She knew she was the one. She knew
[1:00:42] that that chicken or that that eagle
[1:00:45] Amen. wasn't uh uh uh uh uh uh
[1:00:49] uh didn't belong in the chicken yard.
[1:00:52] See, she knew him. She knew that eagllet
[1:00:56] way before he become into that chicken
[1:00:58] yard. Can you say amen? So she knew and
[1:01:01] she came searching for what she knew
[1:01:06] belonged to her.
[1:01:08] Do you believe that? Amen. See, and and
[1:01:11] so her voice was calling him, "Come up
[1:01:14] higher. come up higher. Amen. See, it
[1:01:18] wasn't an earthly voice, if you could
[1:01:19] say it that way. It was coming from the
[1:01:22] heavens. And and it's just like
[1:01:24] Revelations 4:1. Amen. John says, "After
[1:01:28] this, I looked and and brother Brown
[1:01:30] said, "After this meant after the church
[1:01:32] ages were done, after this the church
[1:01:35] ages were finished." He said, John
[1:01:38] representing us now, he says, I looked
[1:01:41] and behold a door was open in heaven and
[1:01:44] and the first voice which I heard was as
[1:01:47] it were of a trumpet talking with me,
[1:01:49] saying, "Come up hither." Can you say
[1:01:52] amen? What was it? We didn't know who we
[1:01:55] belonged to. We didn't know where we
[1:01:57] came from. But it took God took that
[1:02:01] voice to began to speak to us. You don't
[1:02:04] belong here. Come out of her, my people.
[1:02:07] Come out of the world. Can you say amen?
[1:02:10] It was the deep calling unto the deep.
[1:02:13] So it was the voice, her voice that
[1:02:16] revealed to him, Amen. what he was and
[1:02:20] revealed to him the potentials that laid
[1:02:23] within him. It was her voice that began
[1:02:26] to awaken the potentials to where he
[1:02:30] began to realize, I can fly. I don't
[1:02:33] have to be here anymore. And he began to
[1:02:35] stretch them wings and he began to flap
[1:02:38] and and maybe got to the fence post and
[1:02:40] and then he got up to a little higher
[1:02:42] and higher until finally he was there
[1:02:44] soaring. Amen. With mama. Can you say
[1:02:47] amen? Today the word has been opened to
[1:02:51] us and we are being positionally placed
[1:02:54] not in the world, not in politics, not
[1:02:57] in religion, not in some cult, not in
[1:03:01] some uh uh uh denominational church or
[1:03:05] even undenominational church. Will
[1:03:07] Abraham said some of them are worse than
[1:03:09] the denominations and and all of these
[1:03:11] things. See, but we are being
[1:03:13] positionally placed in the word of God.
[1:03:17] Do you believe that? Amen. And brother
[1:03:19] Brandham said, "Every word here is the
[1:03:22] thoughts of God." Amen. In word form.
[1:03:25] This is the thoughts of God in word
[1:03:27] form. Amen. See, and so now we're
[1:03:30] looking by the opening of the word, the
[1:03:33] third pool, opening up and revealing the
[1:03:36] word, a promise to us. Amen. The the
[1:03:39] eternal thoughts of God are no longer a
[1:03:41] mystery to us. Oh my. I hope it's not a
[1:03:45] mystery to you. guessing. We don't have
[1:03:47] to guess who we are. We don't have to
[1:03:49] guess where we're going. We don't have
[1:03:51] to guess who our papa is. We don't have
[1:03:53] to guess what our ancestry is. We don't
[1:03:56] have to guess our lineage. We can tell
[1:03:58] you from the book. Amen. It's all
[1:04:00] written right here of who I am. Amen.
[1:04:04] See, and so God's uh uh the Bible is
[1:04:08] God's thoughts and seed form. Now we are
[1:04:11] becoming we are becoming the
[1:04:15] manifestation of God's thoughts. Do you
[1:04:18] believe that? God thought of his church
[1:04:21] and what he wanted it to be. Well, we
[1:04:23] are the manifestation of that. In God's
[1:04:26] thoughts, he had sons and daughters. So
[1:04:29] to have fellowship with him them. Amen.
[1:04:31] Well, we are the manifestation of that.
[1:04:34] God thought of himself having a family
[1:04:36] that would bear his nature and have his
[1:04:38] very own attributes. And we are the
[1:04:41] manifestation of that. Why? We've come
[1:04:44] into the promised land where every
[1:04:46] promise, every thought of God that he
[1:04:49] thought of us before the foundation of
[1:04:50] the world is now becoming a reality.
[1:04:53] Amen. We're eating off of a new the new
[1:04:56] land. Amen. Not what man thought of us,
[1:04:59] not what the world thought of us, but
[1:05:01] what God thought of us. That's right.
[1:05:06] That's right.
[1:05:09] By the opening of the book, we have
[1:05:11] discovered we've been saved all along.
[1:05:14] That's right. We weren't saved just on
[1:05:16] any given day. We were always saved.
[1:05:21] What? That come from an open book.
[1:05:28] We have been sons and daughters of God
[1:05:30] all along. Not going to be. We are now
[1:05:33] sons of God. Always been sons. God never
[1:05:37] saw us as sinners. He saw us as sons. We
[1:05:40] didn't know it. But when we come into
[1:05:42] that promised land, we begin to see what
[1:05:44] we really are.
[1:05:47] It's our inheritance. It's our
[1:05:48] possession. This word is our
[1:05:50] inheritance.
[1:05:52] You believe it?
[1:05:54] The woman at the well, although she was
[1:05:56] a prostitute, yet she was a daughter of
[1:05:58] God all along. Oh, miserable, wretched,
[1:06:02] outcast individual. Yet, she was a
[1:06:05] daughter of God because in her late gene
[1:06:08] seed, which showed that she was part of
[1:06:10] God's thinking in the beginning, she
[1:06:13] didn't know it. She didn't know who she
[1:06:15] was, but God knew.
[1:06:18] She was under the load of sin, of guilt
[1:06:20] and shame, and living under that weight
[1:06:23] of condemnation, all that. But Jesus
[1:06:26] came to her and performed the Messa
[1:06:29] sign. only done it one time to her.
[1:06:31] Amen. And brother Brandham says, "And
[1:06:32] when that light flashed across that
[1:06:34] predestinated seed, quickly." Amen. Uh
[1:06:38] uh not like them educated scholars
[1:06:41] standing over there criticizing. They
[1:06:43] thought they were in that group, but
[1:06:45] they wasn't. See, they called him the
[1:06:48] ely bub. And but as soon as he hit that
[1:06:51] predestinated seat, that light flashed
[1:06:53] across it. She said, "Sir." See, it come
[1:06:56] to life. It quickened the seed. Sir, I
[1:07:00] perceive that thou art a prophet. We
[1:07:02] know Messiah when he comes, he will do
[1:07:05] this kind of a work. And he said, I am
[1:07:08] speak I am he that speaks with you. Oh
[1:07:10] my, that settled it. Can you say amen?
[1:07:12] He said, see it in another place. He
[1:07:14] says when you become subject to that
[1:07:17] spirit, it throws your whole being
[1:07:20] subject to that spirit.
[1:07:22] And the only way you can become subject
[1:07:24] to that spirit is down in the soul. It
[1:07:27] quickens that word and now he takes
[1:07:31] control of your desires, of your
[1:07:34] emotions, of your feelings, of your He
[1:07:38] takes control of your spirit, of your
[1:07:41] flesh. He takes control, amen, to where
[1:07:45] Satan now can't lie to you and you
[1:07:47] believe it. Satan can Oh, yeah. He can
[1:07:49] come to that old flesh and bother that
[1:07:51] flesh and even bother your spirit and
[1:07:53] and all these things. But now there's
[1:07:55] something that says, "No, no, no, no,
[1:07:57] no. I ain't sick. I'm well.
[1:08:01] I ain't defeated. I've got the victory.
[1:08:03] I'm not a sinner. I'm a saint."
[1:08:06] Can you say amen? And it's throwing your
[1:08:08] body under subjection to your
[1:08:10] confession.
[1:08:12] Amen.
[1:08:14] Yes, sir.
[1:08:15] So the predestinated will of God is
[1:08:18] becoming more clearer to
[1:08:20] us who are in the land of promise in
[1:08:24] Christ. Amen. Now, brother Brandham
[1:08:26] says, and like I say, I'm just laying
[1:08:28] something here, but brother Brandham
[1:08:30] said, "From a little group of the true
[1:08:33] seed of the word, God will present
[1:08:35] Christ a lovely bride, a virgin, a
[1:08:37] virgin of his word." Do you believe
[1:08:39] that? And through them, everybody say
[1:08:41] through them. them and by them
[1:08:46] will be fulfilled all. Everybody say
[1:08:48] all. All. So let's say that again.
[1:08:50] Through them through them and by them
[1:08:53] will be fulfilled all
[1:08:56] that has been promised for his word in
[1:08:58] the virgin who knows no man knows no
[1:09:02] man-made creeds or dogmas. They will
[1:09:05] love him.
[1:09:07] They love his and will have his
[1:09:11] potentials. Amen. For he is their head
[1:09:15] and they are his subjects subject to his
[1:09:18] head. The members of the bride virgin
[1:09:21] bride will love him and they will have
[1:09:23] his potentials for he is their head and
[1:09:25] all power belongs to him. They are
[1:09:28] subject to him as the members of our
[1:09:30] bodies are subject to our heads. Can you
[1:09:32] say amen? Amen. Can you say it with me?
[1:09:35] I have his potentials. I have his I have
[1:09:40] his potentials. The voice has come in
[1:09:43] this day to let me know who I am. Where
[1:09:46] I came from, who I'm a part of. I have
[1:09:49] his potentials for I am his son.
[1:09:53] Can you say amen? Now that word
[1:09:55] potential means capable of development
[1:09:57] into actuality.
[1:10:00] So it's all been laying down inside of
[1:10:02] you. The potentials to be whatever God's
[1:10:05] promised you to be. It's all been lay
[1:10:07] side, ain't that right? And capable of
[1:10:10] developing into actuality, something
[1:10:13] that can develop or become actual.
[1:10:19] This isn't just a mirage or or some
[1:10:22] little word that we say we're sons and
[1:10:24] daughter. That's actual, Sister Martha.
[1:10:26] That's actual
[1:10:29] literally sons and daughters of God.
[1:10:31] Amen.
[1:10:35] Now notice
[1:10:39] potentials. Peter second Peter 1:4 says,
[1:10:42] "Whereby are given unto us great
[1:10:44] exceeding great and precious promises
[1:10:46] that by these you might be partakers of
[1:10:50] the divine nature."
[1:10:52] Right? You got his potentials.
[1:10:56] Having escaped the corruption that is in
[1:10:58] the world through lust. See, so we we we
[1:11:01] are not we are not like the other ages
[1:11:05] just reflecting an attribute of God,
[1:11:09] right? Remember, see in in 2 Peter 15-7,
[1:11:13] Peter tells the church, "Besides this,
[1:11:15] giving all diligence, add to your faith
[1:11:17] virtue, and to virtue knowledge, and to
[1:11:19] knowledge temperance, and to temperance
[1:11:21] patience, and to patience godliness, and
[1:11:23] to godliness brotherly kindness." Can
[1:11:25] you say amen? Brother Brandon said,
[1:11:27] "See, seven virtues, seven ages, seven
[1:11:31] virtues, seven church ages." And he done
[1:11:34] that pyramid and every each
[1:11:37] age as it was building up up up had had
[1:11:42] one virtue started with faith and then
[1:11:45] virtue and then knowledge and then
[1:11:47] temperance. Each age reflecting. Can you
[1:11:50] say amen? Amen. See first age reflected
[1:11:53] faith and the second age virtues. The
[1:11:55] third church age uh reflected knowledge
[1:11:58] and and then temperance and then
[1:12:00] patience and godliness. Seventh church
[1:12:02] brotherly kindness on but but see the
[1:12:05] prophet said the church ages are
[1:12:07] finished.
[1:12:10] Amen.
[1:12:11] The church ages are finished. How many
[1:12:13] believes that denominational ages are
[1:12:16] finished?
[1:12:17] I know they want to argue and say,
[1:12:18] "Well, we're still in the Leoian age."
[1:12:20] But but God's done with it. God's done
[1:12:23] with the Leoysian age. He's finished
[1:12:25] with that Pentecostal age.
[1:12:29] Can you say amen? That's right. So then
[1:12:32] where are we living at? We're living in
[1:12:34] the capstone age. Charity.
[1:12:40] Amen. Which is God himself.
[1:12:45] Can you say amen? The fullness of God.
[1:12:49] Not that we're don't have faith, virtue,
[1:12:51] knowledge, temperance. No, that all
[1:12:53] comes with it. When he's himself comes
[1:12:58] down,
[1:13:00] it's him. It's the fullness of himself
[1:13:03] bodily in the church.
[1:13:06] Can you say amen? Amen. But God is love.
[1:13:09] Everybody say God is love. Love is the
[1:13:12] capstone. Charity is love. Ain't that
[1:13:16] right? So, brother Brandham, in speaking
[1:13:19] of the Messiah sign that was being shown
[1:13:21] to the people night after
[1:13:23] night, he said this. This is the Lord
[1:13:27] Jesus Christ in the form of the Holy
[1:13:29] Spirit moving among his people doing the
[1:13:32] same thing that he did when he was here
[1:13:34] on the earth identifying himself with
[1:13:38] his bride, not the church.
[1:13:43] another place now and and this I as I
[1:13:47] keep going here I want you to really
[1:13:49] listen to what I'm saying but he says
[1:13:52] when Christ is identified in you
[1:13:55] identifying
[1:13:57] himself now that's what the token is
[1:14:00] that's what this capstone age is is
[1:14:02] where Christ identifies himself in the
[1:14:06] individual
[1:14:08] identifying himself in the individual
[1:14:10] that make up the church part of the
[1:14:13] church that's part of the church can you
[1:14:16] say amen so he says identifying himself
[1:14:20] so when Christ is identified in you
[1:14:23] identifying himself then you are
[1:14:26] Christlike
[1:14:28] which the word Christian means to be
[1:14:30] Christlike there's your identification
[1:14:35] not well I go to church I believe in a
[1:14:37] prophet I I follow the message of the
[1:14:39] hour that's not your
[1:14:40] identification But when Christ
[1:14:42] identifies himself in you, you are
[1:14:45] Christlike.
[1:14:49] Amen. So see, it's positionally placing
[1:14:52] us in the word for our day. Do you
[1:14:55] believe that? So this is why Paul would
[1:14:58] say in in the opening scripture that we
[1:15:00] read, "Be ye therefore followers of God
[1:15:04] as dear children." Amen. Amen.
[1:15:10] All right. Be ye therefore followers of
[1:15:12] God, as dear children. He's identifying
[1:15:16] us not as sinners,
[1:15:20] not as poppers,
[1:15:22] not as some vagabond rebellious brats,
[1:15:26] but as dear children,
[1:15:29] sons and daughters of God.
[1:15:35] Can you say amen?
[1:15:37] So then uh one translation says be
[1:15:41] imitators of God. Everybody say be
[1:15:43] imitators of God. Copy him.
[1:15:49] Follow his example. Amen. As
[1:15:53] wellbehaved children. Amen. Imitate
[1:15:57] their father.
[1:15:59] Be imitators of God. copy him and follow
[1:16:02] his example as well behaved children
[1:16:05] imitate their father. Is that not the
[1:16:08] son that gets adopted?
[1:16:14] Well behaved.
[1:16:17] Got the right character.
[1:16:20] Following after the tutor. Amen.
[1:16:25] Now in this we're talking of capstone
[1:16:29] the
[1:16:29] charity coming down upon the church God
[1:16:34] himself and telling us to to act as well
[1:16:37] behaved children.
[1:16:40] Paul tells us charity does not behave
[1:16:43] itself unseemly
[1:16:47] which means inappropriate
[1:16:50] unbecoming
[1:16:52] improper.
[1:16:55] Can you say amen? Amen.
[1:16:58] So now 1 John 2 and5 it says whoso who
[1:17:02] so keepeth his word in him verily is the
[1:17:05] love of God perfected hereby know that
[1:17:08] we are in him. He that saith he abideth
[1:17:11] in him in him right in the promise. He's
[1:17:16] the promised land. He's the
[1:17:19] word. Whosoever abideth in him ought
[1:17:23] himself also to walk even as he walked.
[1:17:27] I ain't gonna copy after this religion
[1:17:29] and this organization and somebody over
[1:17:32] here and somebody I've got my I'm I'm
[1:17:36] copying after him.
[1:17:39] Can you say amen? Why? I realized I'm
[1:17:41] bride. I realized I came out of him and
[1:17:45] what he is. I am
[1:17:48] the prophet. God gave us our own
[1:17:49] identifi our identification. She is him.
[1:17:54] Amen. Can you say amen? So now we've got
[1:17:57] a people that are able. Luther, he
[1:18:00] revealed the just that shall live by
[1:18:01] faith and yet smoking a pipe, drinking.
[1:18:08] Yes. All the imperfections down through
[1:18:10] the ages.
[1:18:13] But here now is a people.
[1:18:17] Hello. Amen. Amen. Amen. That is able.
[1:18:22] And I want to say able
[1:18:25] to walk
[1:18:27] even as he walked.
[1:18:30] Can you say amen? Amen.
[1:18:34] Now back to our opening scripture. Paul
[1:18:37] says, "And walk in love as Christ also
[1:18:40] hath loved us and hath given himself for
[1:18:43] us an offering and a sacrifice to God
[1:18:46] for a sweet smelling savor." Ain't that
[1:18:49] right? See, God so loved John 3:16, God
[1:18:53] so loved the world that he gave his only
[1:18:56] begotten son. Ain't that right? God so
[1:18:59] loved. That's the reason why Christ came
[1:19:01] is because the love of God. That's the
[1:19:04] only reason why Christ came is the love
[1:19:06] of God. Ain't that right? And God wanted
[1:19:09] to make us wanted to make sure we
[1:19:11] understand that that it was because he
[1:19:13] so loved us that he sent his son. And
[1:19:16] the prophet says that Christ is God's
[1:19:19] love gift to us.
[1:19:22] He couldn't give you any other greater
[1:19:24] love or a greater gift. He could have
[1:19:27] given you money. Yes, he could have done
[1:19:29] that. He could have even made you live a
[1:19:31] million years, a billion years if he
[1:19:33] wanted to. It still wouldn't have helped
[1:19:35] you, right? That's right. Cuz what if
[1:19:37] you're what if this is your last day to
[1:19:40] live your billion years out?
[1:19:45] And you lived your billion years without
[1:19:47] fellowship with God and without knowing
[1:19:49] God and without reflecting God, what
[1:19:53] good would it have done? He could have
[1:19:55] given you anything you wanted and and
[1:19:57] all these things, but he gave you the
[1:19:59] best because he loved you. And out of
[1:20:03] his love came Jesus Christ. His love
[1:20:06] produced.
[1:20:09] Grace was projected. Can you say amen?
[1:20:13] And then notice God God was in the sun.
[1:20:18] God sent his son, but God went with his
[1:20:20] son by being in his son.
[1:20:23] Ain't that right? Brother Brown said,
[1:20:25] "See, the great Jehovah came down and
[1:20:28] was made tangible by living in the body
[1:20:31] of his own son, declaring and re
[1:20:33] reconciling the world to himself."
[1:20:36] See, so Jesus was the tabernacle that
[1:20:40] God lived in. God, as as Paul says, God
[1:20:43] was manifested in the flesh. Great is
[1:20:46] the mystery of godliness. God was
[1:20:48] manifested in the flesh. What a great is
[1:20:50] that mystery, huh? Yes sir. So the
[1:20:53] prophet said Christ was nothing short of
[1:20:55] God and God was nothing short of Christ
[1:20:58] and the two together made the godhead
[1:21:01] bodily.
[1:21:03] Ain't that right? Another place Brother
[1:21:05] Bram says when Christ and I want you to
[1:21:07] get it now when Christ the son of God
[1:21:09] was put to the
[1:21:11] test it showed what he was.
[1:21:16] Amen. Amen. Can you say amen? It showed
[1:21:20] that he was God. It showed that he was a
[1:21:22] love gift from God.
[1:21:25] Amen. Ain't that right? When he was sped
[1:21:28] upon, he didn't revile back. When he was
[1:21:31] hit and, you know, smoked and all these
[1:21:34] things, he didn't fight back. That's
[1:21:36] right. That's right. See, so, so Christ
[1:21:41] when he was put to the test, it showed
[1:21:44] what he was. And then brother Bram says,
[1:21:46] "Your behavior of life tells what you
[1:21:48] are." That's right. Not that you go to
[1:21:51] church, you know, 365 days a year and
[1:21:54] you pray 10 hours a day and and and you
[1:21:57] you give you feed the poor and you go
[1:21:59] visit everybody under the sun and and
[1:22:01] all these things. That ain't it. When
[1:22:04] you're put to the test, that shows what
[1:22:06] you are.
[1:22:10] He says your behavior of life tells you
[1:22:12] what you are. When you're put to the
[1:22:14] test, it'll prove what you are. Your
[1:22:17] life always reflects what's on the
[1:22:19] inside of you. By and by, be sure your
[1:22:21] sins don't find you out. Can you say
[1:22:24] amen? So here, God sent Amen. God sent
[1:22:28] his only son, begotten son, because of
[1:22:31] his love. See, God had to come up with
[1:22:35] some way. Man couldn't die for us. No
[1:22:37] other man could die for us. No other
[1:22:39] being, no angel, no animal, no nothing
[1:22:42] could die for us. See, yet God so loved
[1:22:44] that he had to have a remedy. He He
[1:22:46] sought for something that that he he
[1:22:50] only he could take our place.
[1:22:54] The prophet said God never died as God
[1:22:56] because he couldn't. He became man. He
[1:23:01] became a man. He became Jesus Christ.
[1:23:05] That's right. Can you say amen? He took
[1:23:08] on flesh. And notice Paul says he made
[1:23:12] himself a little lower than the angels.
[1:23:16] Why? Because angels couldn't die for us.
[1:23:19] So he had to go even lower than them.
[1:23:24] Amen. Can you say amen? So the prophet
[1:23:28] said, "God, Emmanuel, came down from
[1:23:30] glory and formed himself in a body of
[1:23:33] flesh called the son of God. God uh
[1:23:36] walked on earth among men. He lived like
[1:23:38] a man, but he made himself a little
[1:23:41] lower than the angels in order to take
[1:23:43] death upon himself that he might die the
[1:23:46] death of a sinner for all men. That all
[1:23:49] men who would believe would come to him
[1:23:52] and be saved. So let's say that again.
[1:23:55] Why did he die? So that those who
[1:23:58] believed upon him could be saved. He so
[1:24:01] loved that he wanted amen mankind to
[1:24:05] come back to him. Amen. He come God in
[1:24:08] Christ reconciling the world unto
[1:24:11] himself. He had lost attributes, fallen
[1:24:14] attributes, and he so loved them that he
[1:24:16] had to die. He had to make a way that
[1:24:19] man could come back
[1:24:22] to what he thought of them for
[1:24:24] fellowship. So see God in the
[1:24:33] sun, God in the sun projected the same
[1:24:36] love that was projected in the beginning
[1:24:38] before the foundation of the world. The
[1:24:41] love that caused the lamb to be slain
[1:24:44] before the foundation of the world now
[1:24:47] was being projected in a body of flesh.
[1:24:51] Hello. Amen. It wasn't man that took
[1:24:54] Christ's life from him. It was love.
[1:24:59] He didn't die of his bruises. He didn't
[1:25:01] die of loss of blood. He didn't die from
[1:25:05] all these things. Brother Brown said he
[1:25:06] died of a broken heart.
[1:25:13] Can you say amen? See, so the love that
[1:25:17] was manifested in the heavens that wrote
[1:25:19] our names in the lamb's book of life and
[1:25:22] produced the lamb for us and atonement
[1:25:25] for
[1:25:26] reconciliation. Ain't that right? That
[1:25:29] love was now in a human
[1:25:32] being projected and it was so great that
[1:25:35] Christ gave himself for us as an
[1:25:39] offering.
[1:25:41] Thank you
[1:25:42] Lord. love caused him to give himself as
[1:25:46] a
[1:25:47] sacrifice. The prophet said he had to
[1:25:50] become a man so that the stinger of
[1:25:52] death could penetrate him. Can you say
[1:25:55] amen?
[1:25:56] He said, see, if he had been an immortal
[1:25:59] person, if he had been in the theophony
[1:26:01] like Melzdc or been in the spirit like
[1:26:04] he was, Amen. all all this time, God is
[1:26:08] spirit. See, death has no control of
[1:26:10] that. Death couldn't kill that theophony
[1:26:13] in Melzdc. When when Melzdc God appeared
[1:26:15] in a theophony to Melzdc, death couldn't
[1:26:18] touch him. Amen. God being a spirit,
[1:26:21] death couldn't touch him. Amen. God had
[1:26:24] to become something in order for death
[1:26:26] to be able to touch him.
[1:26:31] See, it had to become flesh that he
[1:26:33] could take the stinger of death. When a
[1:26:35] bee or an instinct or an instinct insect
[1:26:38] uh who stings once stings deep, he'll
[1:26:41] never sting again. He leaves his stinger
[1:26:43] in the flesh. That's what God became.
[1:26:46] Christ dwelt in the flesh that he might
[1:26:48] anchor his own flesh, the stinger of
[1:26:50] death. See, or anchor in his own flesh,
[1:26:53] the stinger of death. And when death
[1:26:55] pulled away from him at the cross, it
[1:26:58] left its stinger. It could not sting a
[1:27:01] believer anymore. It can make a humming
[1:27:03] noise. It can make a buzz and a threat,
[1:27:05] but it can not sting. It has no stinger.
[1:27:10] And God's going to prove that by a
[1:27:12] people on the earth, I believe, that's
[1:27:14] living now, that'll never taste death.
[1:27:17] And those that have went by the way of
[1:27:19] the grave are going to rise up again any
[1:27:22] moment now because the stinger of death
[1:27:25] is no longer death has lost its stinger.
[1:27:31] Lord, I love it.
[1:27:33] So this is what love done. The love, God
[1:27:36] dwelt bodily. God is love. He dwelt
[1:27:40] bodily in Christ. And that love was
[1:27:43] projected. And Christ's whole goal was
[1:27:47] to bring and to reconcile man to make an
[1:27:49] atonement for man to break the walls of
[1:27:53] Satan that has been built up around man.
[1:27:57] Praise the Lord. Hello. Amen. Now notice
[1:28:00] what John says in 1 John 3:18. My little
[1:28:03] children, let us love. Everybody say,
[1:28:06] "Let us love in uh let us not love in
[1:28:10] word, neither in tongue, but in deed and
[1:28:14] in truth."
[1:28:16] Don't just love in theory and speech.
[1:28:20] God didn't.
[1:28:22] God didn't just say, "I love them. Oh, I
[1:28:24] love them." But he proved that love by
[1:28:27] action. Amen.
[1:28:30] Love indeed, love in practice, action,
[1:28:34] sincerity. Ain't that right? Now, 1 John
[1:28:38] 3:16, hereby perceive we the love of God
[1:28:42] because he laid down his life for us,
[1:28:45] and we ought to lay down our lives for
[1:28:49] the brethren.
[1:28:51] Can we do it? Yes, sir, we can. It's
[1:28:54] capstone age.
[1:28:56] The same God that dwelt in that body of
[1:28:59] Christ is now in the church.
[1:29:03] Amen. Praise the Lord.
[1:29:07] In another place, the Bible tells us,
[1:29:08] Paul writes that Jesus thought it not
[1:29:10] robbery to be equal with God, but made
[1:29:13] but took upon himself the form of a
[1:29:15] servant. Again, because he was God's
[1:29:17] love gift to us, he come to show us what
[1:29:19] God is. And he did just that. How many
[1:29:22] believes that? Amen. Amen. The
[1:29:24] unbeliever saw a devil. The unbeliever
[1:29:26] saw a witch. The unbeliever saw
[1:29:28] whatever. But the believer saw God in
[1:29:30] that man. Amen. That's right. And and
[1:29:33] even those that didn't even understand
[1:29:35] his life. Amen. Like Philillip that
[1:29:37] says, "Oh, it it it sufficeth us that
[1:29:40] you show us the father." And Jesus
[1:29:42] turned around said, "Have I not been so
[1:29:43] long with you and you still don't know
[1:29:45] who I am? He that seeth me hath seen the
[1:29:47] father. I'm the one. It's not me that's
[1:29:49] doing the works. It's the father that
[1:29:50] dwelleth in me that's doing the works."
[1:29:52] Amen. Even his critic says, "No, we
[1:29:54] understand you came from God because no
[1:29:56] man can do the things that you do." What
[1:29:58] was it? He showed what God is. Not just
[1:30:02] in miracles, not just in his preaching,
[1:30:05] but as he walked to that Calvary,
[1:30:07] bearing that cross and the times that he
[1:30:10] fell and he got back up, he was showing
[1:30:13] the heart of God.
[1:30:16] Praise the Lord.
[1:30:22] John 1:18 says, "No man hath seen God at
[1:30:24] any time. The only begotten son which is
[1:30:28] in the bosom of the father, he hath
[1:30:29] declared him." God is power and he
[1:30:34] declared that to us by dis de
[1:30:36] demonstrating it. God is holy and he
[1:30:40] declared it to us by demonstrating it to
[1:30:43] us. Can you say amen? God is
[1:30:45] supernatural and he declared it. Christ
[1:30:49] declared it by demonstrating it to us.
[1:30:53] God is love and he declared it by
[1:30:57] demonstrating it to us.
[1:30:59] Romans 5:6 says, "For when we were yet
[1:31:03] without
[1:31:04] strength, in due time Christ died for
[1:31:07] the ungodly. For scarcely a righteous
[1:31:10] man for for scarcely for a righteous man
[1:31:12] will one die. Yet per adventure, for a
[1:31:15] good man, some would dare even dare to
[1:31:19] die. But God commendeth or demonstrated
[1:31:22] his love. His own love. His love. Can
[1:31:26] you say amen? See, demonstrated his own
[1:31:30] love toward us in that while we were yet
[1:31:33] sinners, Christ died for us. Oh, aren't
[1:31:36] you glad for that? Much more than now
[1:31:39] being now justified by his blood, we
[1:31:41] shall be saved from the wrath through
[1:31:43] from wrath through him. For if when we
[1:31:46] were enemies, we were reconciled to God
[1:31:49] by the death of his son, much more being
[1:31:52] reconciled, we shall be saved by his
[1:31:56] life.
[1:31:58] So because he loved us, he sought to
[1:32:00] save us. Amen. His whole desire was to
[1:32:03] bring us to reconciliation
[1:32:06] to save us. Can you say amen? Amen. Now,
[1:32:09] notice what a prophet says. His church
[1:32:12] is supposed to manifest God to show what
[1:32:15] God is. Amen.
[1:32:19] Christ was sent to earth to show to man
[1:32:22] what God is. Now, the church that has
[1:32:26] been reconciled, that has been redeemed,
[1:32:28] that has come into and being
[1:32:31] positionally placed in the word to find
[1:32:34] her position. Amen.
[1:32:37] Now we're understanding we're not
[1:32:39] sinners. We're not helpless people.
[1:32:41] We're not in the chicken yard just
[1:32:44] Amen.
[1:32:46] We're eagles. That's right. Amen. We're
[1:32:50] sons and daughters. Amen. And we are now
[1:32:55] to reflect to the world what God is.
[1:32:58] That's right. To show. Ain't that right?
[1:33:01] Now, the only way that we can do that is
[1:33:04] all that God was, he poured into Christ.
[1:33:07] Or the prophet says in one place, all
[1:33:08] that God is, he poured into Christ. And
[1:33:12] all that Christ is, he poured into the
[1:33:16] church. That's the only way we could
[1:33:18] show what God is, is that he would pour
[1:33:20] himself into us. And so has he done it
[1:33:24] in this day. So then walk walk in love
[1:33:28] as Christ also loved the church and gave
[1:33:30] himself for it. You see when a person
[1:33:35] walks in love as Christ loved he or she
[1:33:39] wants people to be saved. That's the
[1:33:41] goal. That's the desire. Yeah. We want
[1:33:44] to go in a rapture, but we don't want to
[1:33:46] go alone.
[1:33:50] Hello. Amen.
[1:33:58] When a person walks in
[1:34:00] love, you see, we we don't want people
[1:34:03] to miss the rapture, do we?
[1:34:07] We certainly don't want to miss the
[1:34:08] rapture, but we we don't want people to
[1:34:10] miss it. We we don't want people to have
[1:34:13] to go through the tribulation.
[1:34:16] We don't want people
[1:34:17] to go to hell.
[1:34:21] We don't want people to be tormented of
[1:34:23] the devil. Jesus didn't.
[1:34:26] Amen. Jesus didn't want the Pharisees to
[1:34:29] be what they were. He didn't want them
[1:34:31] to be lost. That's right. He preached
[1:34:34] among them. He knew they wouldn't listen
[1:34:35] to him, but he preached anyways. He gave
[1:34:37] them a chance. Anyway, God gave Cain a
[1:34:40] chance.
[1:34:43] You see, it's it's it's because of
[1:34:46] divine love. That's right. Can you say
[1:34:49] amen? Amen. So, he's so loved that he
[1:34:52] sanctified himself for our sake. You
[1:34:55] know, I I honestly believe that that he
[1:34:58] was careful as to what he listened
[1:35:00] to. He was careful as to the places he
[1:35:04] went.
[1:35:05] He was careful as to what he looked at.
[1:35:08] He kept himself in a
[1:35:10] way so that people would not mistake him
[1:35:14] to be something other than the Messiah.
[1:35:18] because he's so loved.
[1:35:21] Hello.
[1:35:24] He He couldn't help the people if they
[1:35:26] doubted him of who he was. Can you say
[1:35:29] amen?
[1:35:33] If someone doubts
[1:35:36] him and they doubted him, then then how
[1:35:39] could he help them? We find that he went
[1:35:42] to his own town, his own city I believe
[1:35:44] it was, and did not one miracle because
[1:35:47] of their unbelief. Yes. So he come to
[1:35:51] help. He come to show the way of life.
[1:35:54] He come to redeem.
[1:35:57] He didn't come to fight with people.
[1:35:59] That's right. He get didn't come to show
[1:36:02] off. Amen. He took upon himself the form
[1:36:05] of a servant. Amen. That people could be
[1:36:08] helped in some way. Amen.
[1:36:12] That's right. Ain't that right?
[1:36:15] So, see, he he didn't
[1:36:18] come he didn't come to give the people
[1:36:20] new clothes.
[1:36:22] He didn't come to give the people a new
[1:36:24] car, a new house. He He He didn't come
[1:36:28] to to deliver the Jews from the Roman
[1:36:32] government. He didn't come for any of
[1:36:34] that.
[1:36:36] Ain't that right? So, what did he come
[1:36:38] for? to give them eternal life. That's
[1:36:41] right. He wasn't there just to be
[1:36:43] friends with people and shake hands with
[1:36:45] them, rub shoulders with them. He come
[1:36:47] to give people eternal life.
[1:36:51] That's right. Amen.
[1:36:54] He's the only one that could have done
[1:36:55] it.
[1:36:57] The preachers couldn't give the people
[1:36:59] eternal life.
[1:37:01] Ain't that right?
[1:37:04] Mom and dad couldn't give it to them.
[1:37:06] The deacons could. No one could. He was
[1:37:09] the one to give them eternal life. Amen.
[1:37:16] Notice John 6:39. And this is the
[1:37:19] Father's will which hath sent me, that
[1:37:22] of all which he hath given me, I should
[1:37:24] lose nothing, but should raise it up
[1:37:26] again at the last day. But notice the
[1:37:29] catch. They had to believe. Can you say
[1:37:32] that with me? They had to believe him.
[1:37:35] They had to believe on him. They had to
[1:37:36] believe him. So they had to trust him.
[1:37:39] They had to be sure that he was God.
[1:37:41] They had to be sure that he was sent to
[1:37:43] be the Messiah. They had to be sure that
[1:37:46] he was that prophet that Moses spoke of.
[1:37:48] He They had to be sure. So therefore, he
[1:37:53] had to live in a way
[1:37:56] that they could believe him.
[1:38:02] You believe it? Amen.
[1:38:05] See, John 3:16, "For God so loved the
[1:38:07] world that he gave his only begotten son
[1:38:08] that whosoever believeth in him should
[1:38:12] not perish, but have everlasting life."
[1:38:15] Ain't that right? Who was going to get
[1:38:17] the everlasting life? Those that
[1:38:19] believed in him. For God sent not his
[1:38:22] son into the world to condemn the world,
[1:38:24] but that the world through him might be
[1:38:26] saved. He that believeth on him is not
[1:38:29] condemned. You see how it was important
[1:38:31] that the people believed? Amen.
[1:38:35] Amen. But he that believeth not is
[1:38:38] condemned already because he hath not
[1:38:40] believed in the name of the only
[1:38:42] begotten son of
[1:38:43] God. Jesus said in John 8:24, "If you
[1:38:47] believe not that I am he, you shall die
[1:38:50] in your sins."
[1:38:53] John 6:40, "And this is the will of him
[1:38:55] that sent me, that everyone that seeth
[1:38:56] the son and believeth on him may have
[1:38:59] everlasting life, and I will raise him
[1:39:01] up at the last day.
[1:39:03] John 1:12, "As many as received him, to
[1:39:06] them gave he power to become the sons of
[1:39:08] God, even to them that believe on his
[1:39:11] name."
[1:39:13] 2 Corinthians 8:9, "For you know the
[1:39:15] grace of God, the grace of our Lord
[1:39:17] Jesus Christ, that though he was rich,
[1:39:20] yet for your sakes he became poor, that
[1:39:24] through his poverty you might be rich."
[1:39:27] And we're talking about rich in eternal
[1:39:29] things. Can you say amen? He became
[1:39:33] something that we could recognize.
[1:39:36] Amen.
[1:39:37] He became common to us that we could be
[1:39:40] easily recognize him.
[1:39:43] Lord, he didn't become so superior that
[1:39:45] we didn't know and understand him. He
[1:39:47] come to the lowest speaking a common
[1:39:50] language, not trying to show his
[1:39:51] intellectuals and not trying to show
[1:39:53] himself. He so loved people
[1:39:57] that he wanted them to believe. Amen.
[1:40:02] That's good. Praise the Lord.
[1:40:05] He did it all for our
[1:40:07] sakes. Now, I ain't got much longer, but
[1:40:10] I'm going to
[1:40:11] finish 2 Corinthians
[1:40:14] 5:20. Now
[1:40:16] then, we are ambassadors for Christ.
[1:40:22] As though God did beseech you by us, we
[1:40:25] pray you in who's dead. Christ. Oh,
[1:40:29] who's dead?
[1:40:31] We pray you in thestead of the one that
[1:40:33] made himself a servant.
[1:40:37] We're taking his place.
[1:40:41] All right.
[1:40:42] The one that became
[1:40:44] poor that through his poverty we could
[1:40:48] be rich.
[1:40:50] We're taking his place. Praise the Lord.
[1:40:53] We're ambassadors.
[1:40:56] Can you say amen? Amen.
[1:41:00] We are ambassadors as though God did
[1:41:01] beseech you by us. We pray you in
[1:41:04] Christstead be reconciled to God.
[1:41:08] We pray you in Christstead that you join
[1:41:11] a church.
[1:41:13] No, that don't sound right, does it? We
[1:41:15] pray, Amen, in Christstead that you make
[1:41:18] me rich.
[1:41:20] Bring in all your tithing and your
[1:41:22] offerings and sow your seeds.
[1:41:28] We pray you in Christstead be reconciled
[1:41:31] to God. Amen. Can you say amen? Amen.
[1:41:34] What is it? The same passion, the same
[1:41:36] love, the same love that was exhibited
[1:41:39] up in the heavens that wrote the names
[1:41:40] on the lamb's book of life. The same
[1:41:42] love that was exhibited in a man called
[1:41:44] Christ in that body of flesh that went
[1:41:46] to Calvary. Now that same love is within
[1:41:49] a redeemed.
[1:41:53] Amen.
[1:41:55] Why? Because it's God in you. That's
[1:41:57] right.
[1:41:59] All that God is, he poured into Christ.
[1:42:01] And all that Christ is, he poured into
[1:42:03] us.
[1:42:07] For he hath made him to be sin for us.
[1:42:10] Notice our message. He hath made him to
[1:42:12] be sin for us, who knew no sin, that we
[1:42:15] might be made the righteousness of God
[1:42:17] in him. You don't have to be a sinner.
[1:42:21] You don't have to live
[1:42:23] defeated. Amen.
[1:42:25] Amen. You don't have to go to hell.
[1:42:31] You see, that word ambassador means to
[1:42:34] act as a representative for. So, we're
[1:42:36] acting in his place. Amen. In thestead
[1:42:39] of Christ, we're acting in his place.
[1:42:44] Now, think of it. God sends us out to
[1:42:45] the world because there's still an
[1:42:46] undying love that's still beaten for
[1:42:48] souls.
[1:42:51] It ain't about talent. It ain't about
[1:42:54] how good we can preach and
[1:42:59] how good we can sing and play music and
[1:43:02] it's not
[1:43:04] about what we make it to be sometimes.
[1:43:08] Amen. Prophet said he's at the right
[1:43:10] hand of God acting in your place this
[1:43:12] morning. Aren't you glad for that?
[1:43:15] He's acting in your place this morning
[1:43:17] as you're acting in his place down here
[1:43:19] as a witness.
[1:43:20] A witness is to act instead of somebody
[1:43:23] stand for you as a witness. So as your
[1:43:27] life reflects here what your testimony
[1:43:29] is in Christ, it reflects there and it
[1:43:32] reflects here. And he is up there and
[1:43:35] what he is for you reflects both there
[1:43:38] and here. Oh, isn't that wonderful?
[1:43:42] Now, 2 Corinthians 5:18, it says, "All
[1:43:45] things are of God, who hath reconciled
[1:43:48] us to himself by Jesus Christ." Amen.
[1:43:51] And hath given to us, everybody say to
[1:43:55] us, he's given to us
[1:43:59] because his love is undying. Yeah. The
[1:44:02] ministry of reconciliation
[1:44:05] to it that God was in Christ reconciling
[1:44:07] the world unto himself, not imputing
[1:44:10] their trespasses unto them, and hath
[1:44:12] committed unto us the word of
[1:44:16] reconciliation. I hope this is all
[1:44:18] right. Today
[1:44:20] prophet said he was made flesh and dwelt
[1:44:22] among us in order that he could come
[1:44:24] back again to man and live in man and
[1:44:26] restore a man to a state of communion
[1:44:28] with him again and give him back his
[1:44:31] god-given right. And that's what he did.
[1:44:35] That's the purpose of the Holy Ghost.
[1:44:36] It's the father again. God the father
[1:44:39] dwelling in you, working out his plans.
[1:44:42] see to finish his plan of redemption.
[1:44:44] Working through you, making you a
[1:44:46] coworker with him, giving you a place,
[1:44:49] giving you a part for your fallen, lost
[1:44:52] brother and sister, giving you his
[1:44:55] spirit and his love to go hunt the lost.
[1:44:58] And he as he did in the Garden of Eden
[1:45:01] when he cried, "Adam, Adam, where art
[1:45:04] thou?"
[1:45:06] That's what the Holy Spirit does to a
[1:45:07] man or woman. when it strikes into their
[1:45:10] heart, it takes its abode and there's a
[1:45:12] thirst and a hungering for lost souls.
[1:45:16] That's what's the matter with the
[1:45:17] meetings today. There's not enough
[1:45:18] spirit touch in it to go for the souls
[1:45:21] of the lost and the dying. Can you say
[1:45:23] amen? So, you see, God given us talents.
[1:45:26] God's given us ministry. God's given us
[1:45:28] things in our lives. And every one of
[1:45:31] us, if you're part of this body of
[1:45:33] Christ, you have it within you. Don't
[1:45:35] let the devil tell you you're just a
[1:45:37] nobody and you're just nothing. That is
[1:45:39] a that's just such a a lie of the devil.
[1:45:43] Prophet said you're so important that
[1:45:45] nobody can take your place. That means
[1:45:48] you're important in this body. And
[1:45:50] whatever God has given you to do, let
[1:45:52] love control it. Let love control the
[1:45:55] gifts. Let love control the talents. Let
[1:45:57] love control the ministry.
[1:46:01] Let love control.
[1:46:03] Can you say amen? You see, ministry has
[1:46:06] been given to us for the sake of others
[1:46:09] that they might believe on the Lord
[1:46:10] Jesus Christ too and be saved. Jesus
[1:46:14] says, "If I be lifted up, I will draw
[1:46:16] all men unto me." Ain't that right? I
[1:46:19] will draw the black man. I will draw the
[1:46:21] red man, the yellow man, the white man,
[1:46:24] the brown man. I will draw the Germans.
[1:46:28] I will draw, you know, men that that are
[1:46:32] Russian. And and you know, I I will draw
[1:46:35] those from China. I will draw I'll draw
[1:46:37] all men of all places unto me
[1:46:41] if I just be lifted
[1:46:43] up. If I could just be lifted up, I'll
[1:46:46] do the
[1:46:47] drawing. Ain't that right?
[1:46:52] This why Paul would say in 2 Corinthians
[1:46:54] 4:4, "We preach not
[1:46:57] ourselves, but Christ the Lord Jesus,
[1:46:59] and ourselves your servants for Jesus'
[1:47:01] sake." Can you say amen? So we we become
[1:47:05] servants to the people for Jesus'
[1:47:07] sake. We can't lift him up if we're
[1:47:10] trying to be somebody.
[1:47:13] We can't we we can't lift him up if
[1:47:16] we're so bound by our complexes.
[1:47:19] If if we're so looking for approval from
[1:47:21] men, we can't lift him up.
[1:47:26] Hello. Yeah. Can't lift him up to the
[1:47:29] people if we're trying to build our own
[1:47:33] kingdom. And we become servants to the
[1:47:36] people when we sanctify ourselves.
[1:47:40] Ain't that right?
[1:47:42] We become servants to the people when we
[1:47:44] do the will of God. Not when we do the
[1:47:47] people's bidding, but when we do the
[1:47:50] will of God. We become servants to the
[1:47:53] people when we become yielded to the
[1:47:55] father. Can you say amen? That's when we
[1:48:00] love as Christ loved us
[1:48:05] because we're becoming so one with the
[1:48:07] father that he now has the preeminence
[1:48:10] in our lives that he can show what he is
[1:48:13] through us and that people don't see a
[1:48:15] personality. They're not drawn to some
[1:48:17] personality or some individual per se.
[1:48:20] They're not drawn to some fleshly idea.
[1:48:22] They're drawn to the spirit of God that
[1:48:24] is reflecting and radiating from an
[1:48:27] individual
[1:48:29] to say, "I know that man is a real
[1:48:31] Christian." He's got the goods. That
[1:48:33] woman's got the goods. That boy, that
[1:48:35] girl, I want what they've got. That's
[1:48:38] right. Can you say amen? Amen. You would
[1:48:42] think that everybody would want it, but
[1:48:44] that's not the case. Jesus was God
[1:48:47] himself, the fullness of God made flesh,
[1:48:49] and yet the people despised him. But he
[1:48:51] there was an elect.
[1:48:55] You believe it? Amen.
[1:48:58] Now
[1:48:59] notice as we wind it down now, but it
[1:49:02] was the Apostle Paul that said, "All
[1:49:04] things are for your sakes." Think of
[1:49:06] that. All things are for your sakes.
[1:49:11] He's talking to a people, right?
[1:49:17] So here, 2 Corinthians 4:8, it it it
[1:49:22] tells us what he means by all things are
[1:49:25] for your sakes. We are troubled on every
[1:49:27] side yet not distressed. We are
[1:49:30] perplexed but not in despair. Right?
[1:49:35] Persecuted but not forsaken. Amen. Cast
[1:49:39] down but not destroyed.
[1:49:42] always bearing about in the body the
[1:49:45] dying of the Lord Jesus, that the life
[1:49:47] also of Jesus might be made manifest in
[1:49:50] our body. Amen. For we which live are
[1:49:53] always delivered unto death for Jesus'
[1:49:56] sake. Think of that. For Jesus' sake,
[1:49:58] that the life also of Jesus might be
[1:50:01] made manifest in our mortal flesh.
[1:50:04] So then death workketh in us, but life
[1:50:06] in you. Amen.
[1:50:09] Yeah. See, so Paul knew that his
[1:50:11] ministry was for the people.
[1:50:14] He was cast down, but it didn't shake
[1:50:16] him. That's right. He He He was in
[1:50:19] despair or uh uh shipwrecked. He was all
[1:50:22] of these things, persecuted and cast
[1:50:24] down and in distressed and perplexed and
[1:50:28] trouble on every side. But he knew it
[1:50:30] had to be. He wasn't trying to prophesy
[1:50:33] himself out of the trouble. He wasn't
[1:50:35] whining and complaining about everybody
[1:50:38] his actions against him
[1:50:41] cuz he knew that if just Christ could be
[1:50:44] reflected. Amen. If Christ could be
[1:50:47] reflected, then it'd be worth dying in
[1:50:50] my body, bearing the suffering in my
[1:50:53] body, death working in me that life
[1:50:56] could work in them. Amen.
[1:51:01] So then as love caused Christ to live a
[1:51:04] sacrificial life, love caused Paul to
[1:51:07] live a sacrificial life for the sake of
[1:51:09] others. Can you say amen? And I want to
[1:51:12] say this, a sacrificial life is it isn't
[1:51:16] meaning that you got to become a monk.
[1:51:20] Doesn't mean that you ladies have to
[1:51:22] live as a nun.
[1:51:24] all these things. You see, Satan has so
[1:51:26] perverted the the meaning of sacrificial
[1:51:29] living and he's taken it to such
[1:51:32] [Music]
[1:51:34] extremes. But the life of a nun isn't a
[1:51:37] display of God's love. The sacrificial
[1:51:40] life of a monk that he lives isn't a
[1:51:43] display of God's love. Can you say amen?
[1:51:46] Most people who live a sacrificial life
[1:51:48] live in misery. That's it. That Paul
[1:51:51] wasn't living in misery.
[1:51:53] Jesus wasn't living in misery. When he
[1:51:56] said, "I sanctify myself for their
[1:51:58] sakes, Father." He wasn't living in
[1:51:59] misery. Amen. But most people that live
[1:52:03] sacrificial lives, it's it's it's it's a
[1:52:05] misery thing. And and most sacrificial
[1:52:08] lives is is for to get God's attention
[1:52:11] and and somehow that they win and merit
[1:52:14] their way into life. That's what
[1:52:16] sacrificial life is to a lot of folks.
[1:52:18] But that's not to a Christian.
[1:52:20] Sacrificial life is not that I merit my
[1:52:23] way to heaven. Sacrificial life is for
[1:52:25] the sake of others that are watching me.
[1:52:28] Amen.
[1:52:30] Help us God.
[1:52:33] Amen. Can you say amen? Amen. Jesus
[1:52:37] said, "I do always that which pleases
[1:52:39] the father." Another place said, "My
[1:52:40] meat is to do the will of him that sent
[1:52:42] me." So then doing the will of the
[1:52:44] father is a sacrificial
[1:52:46] life. Can you say amen? We don't live
[1:52:49] the Christian life grumbling and
[1:52:50] complaining and wishing we could do
[1:52:52] something different.
[1:52:54] If if if you're in that place, then
[1:52:56] you're not you ain't got the love of
[1:52:57] God.
[1:53:00] It's truth.
[1:53:01] But notice in in in Ephesians 4:1, Paul
[1:53:04] put it in a nutshell when he said, "I
[1:53:06] therefore the prisoner of the Lord." Can
[1:53:09] you say amen? And the prophet said,
[1:53:11] "See, God had a man that was subject to
[1:53:14] him, harnessed to him, and could not
[1:53:16] move until the word of God moved him. He
[1:53:19] was yolked up in the bond of love to
[1:53:23] God." And he said, "And that's what
[1:53:25] every true believer is, is a prisoner of
[1:53:28] Christ." Amen. A prisoner of love. What
[1:53:31] pre pleased Christ pleased
[1:53:34] Paul. What Christ wanted, Paul wanted.
[1:53:37] What Christ was after, Paul was after.
[1:53:40] Can you say amen? And as Christ
[1:53:42] sanctified himself for the sake of
[1:53:44] others that would believe on him, so did
[1:53:46] Paul sanctify himself for the same
[1:53:48] reason. Why? Christ wanted the people to
[1:53:52] believe on him. Paul wanted the people
[1:53:55] to believe on Christ.
[1:53:58] But listen, he was the ambassador.
[1:54:02] He was standing in
[1:54:05] Christstead. Amen. Amen. So the prophet
[1:54:09] said Christians that that that say we're
[1:54:11] Christians and then they live so far
[1:54:13] from a Christian life, they're the
[1:54:16] biggest stumbling block.
[1:54:20] Can you say amen? Most people are turned
[1:54:23] off from Christ the way people act and
[1:54:26] live.
[1:54:28] Very true.
[1:54:30] No wonder the prophet said that's why he
[1:54:32] he said we're lacking love. Lacking
[1:54:34] love. Amen. You can't live a sacrifice
[1:54:37] without the love of God. Amen. God left
[1:54:40] heaven. God left his throne to become
[1:54:42] man because of love. Amen. Yes, sir.
[1:54:47] Praise his name. What it do to us,
[1:54:50] right?
[1:54:52] Jesus said this in John 6:35. I am the
[1:54:55] bread of life. He that cometh to me
[1:54:56] shall never hunger, and he that
[1:54:58] believeth on me shall never thirst. So
[1:55:01] this is what Christ was to the people.
[1:55:03] if they could get to him and believe on
[1:55:05] him, they would never hunger. They would
[1:55:06] never thirst again. See, and Paul
[1:55:09] understood that as the ambassador for
[1:55:10] Christ, then it was his his his goal,
[1:55:14] his desire, his purpose for whole
[1:55:16] ministry, for his whole life after his
[1:55:18] conversion was to get people to Christ.
[1:55:21] Get people to Christ. Amen.
[1:55:24] You believe it? Amen. And he knew that
[1:55:27] he was standing in his day as an
[1:55:30] ambassador in thestead of Christ. His
[1:55:33] ministry was given to him so that the
[1:55:35] people could be reconciled to God.
[1:55:37] Therefore, therefore, he behaved himself
[1:55:40] in a way that people could believe.
[1:55:45] True.
[1:55:47] Amen.
[1:55:49] He wanted the people to have that
[1:55:51] opportunity to
[1:55:53] believe. If they didn't believe that was
[1:55:55] not Paul's fault, it it was the people's
[1:55:57] fault.
[1:55:59] But when it come to Paul, he lived in
[1:56:01] such a way. He behaved himself in such a
[1:56:04] way that when he got behind the pulpit,
[1:56:06] people didn't say, "Well, that old
[1:56:07] hypocrite right there, buddy, he's a
[1:56:09] thief. He's a liar. He's a no scum." The
[1:56:12] guy, he talks it, but he can't walk it.
[1:56:15] No, no, no, no, no. Paul's purpose, his
[1:56:19] goal, his vision, his drive. I got to
[1:56:22] get him to Christ. Can you say amen?
[1:56:26] Hallelujah.
[1:56:28] So we find here in 1 Thessalonians 1:5,
[1:56:32] "For our gospel came not unto you in
[1:56:34] word only." Now notice this is Paul
[1:56:36] talking to the group of people. Our
[1:56:38] gospel came not unto you in word only.
[1:56:40] This wasn't just me speaking to you, a
[1:56:43] little flowery sermon, but it came also
[1:56:46] in power and in the Holy Ghost and in
[1:56:49] much assurance. And notice as you know
[1:56:52] what manner of men we were among you for
[1:56:56] your sake. Amen. That's good. Ain't that
[1:56:59] right? 2 Thessalonians 3:6, we command
[1:57:02] you, brethren, in the name of our Lord
[1:57:04] Jesus Christ, that you withdraw
[1:57:06] yourselves from every brother that
[1:57:07] walketh disorderly, and not after the
[1:57:09] tradition which he received of us. For
[1:57:12] yourselves know how you ought to follow
[1:57:14] us. Notice now he's putting himself, he
[1:57:16] knows he's the ambassador,
[1:57:19] and he's not a Jim Jones, he's not a
[1:57:21] David Caresh, he's not some other that's
[1:57:23] leading him out to a death trap. Amen.
[1:57:26] There's too many of them that's out
[1:57:28] there leading people into slaughter.
[1:57:32] But he had to stand there and say,
[1:57:33] "Follow me."
[1:57:38] Yourselves know how you ought to follow
[1:57:40] us. For we behaved not ourselves
[1:57:43] disorderly among you. That's right.
[1:57:45] That's the truth. Neither did we eat any
[1:57:47] man's bread for not, but wrought with
[1:57:49] labor and travail night and day that we
[1:57:51] might not be chargeable to any of you.
[1:57:54] Not because we have not power, but to
[1:57:57] make ourselves an example unto you to
[1:58:00] follow us. So, was Paul trying to build
[1:58:03] himself up before the people? Absolutely
[1:58:06] not. Hello.
[1:58:09] But but see, he knew that someone
[1:58:12] someone was going to follow him whether
[1:58:15] he wanted them to or not. You know,
[1:58:17] Brother Brown said someone's going to
[1:58:18] follow your life whether you want them
[1:58:20] or not. Every one of you are going to
[1:58:22] influence somebody. I don't care what
[1:58:24] you do, where you go, how whether you
[1:58:26] like it or not, somebody is going to be
[1:58:29] influenced by your life. And Paul knew
[1:58:32] that.
[1:58:33] You sit and grumble and you gripe and
[1:58:35] you and you're in and out of church and
[1:58:37] you just live in lukewarm. Remember,
[1:58:39] somebody's following that. They're going
[1:58:42] to follow you into that. Yeah. Whether
[1:58:45] it be your children pick up your spirit
[1:58:47] and and act like you and and and just
[1:58:49] live uh half lukewarm and and don't
[1:58:52] really care about God and just as long
[1:58:55] as I'm a Christian, just as long as I'm
[1:58:56] a message believer, somebody's got to
[1:58:58] get love within them.
[1:59:08] See, he wanted someone to follow.
[1:59:12] Brother Brham said, "Somebody's going to
[1:59:13] follow your footsteps." People are going
[1:59:15] to follow something. So Paul puts
[1:59:18] himself out as the
[1:59:20] follower of Christ and says, "Follow
[1:59:22] me." Notice 1 Corinthians 11:1, "Be ye
[1:59:25] followers of me, even as I also am
[1:59:28] Christ." In other words, the prophet
[1:59:30] said, "Just as I follow Christ, you
[1:59:32] follow me." Right? Just as I follow
[1:59:35] Christ, you follow me. But I promise
[1:59:37] you, Paul would tell him if if you could
[1:59:40] read between the lines, I'm not going to
[1:59:41] mislead you.
[1:59:44] I'm too worried about your soul. I love
[1:59:46] you too much.
[1:59:49] Amen. Amen.
[1:59:53] God has put us in this world to
[1:59:54] influence people. It could be your
[1:59:56] spouse that you influence. It could be
[1:59:57] your children. It could be your boss,
[2:00:00] employee. It could be somebody sitting
[2:00:01] in the pew. True. Could be someone in
[2:00:04] the church. Could be one of these
[2:00:09] boys. Whether you realize it or not,
[2:00:11] maybe they're watching
[2:00:13] you, watching how you conduct yourself
[2:00:15] outside of
[2:00:17] church. Watch how you conduct yourself
[2:00:19] in the
[2:00:21] trials. I was raised in church. I sat on
[2:00:24] the front
[2:00:25] pew. But I knew I knew when one man was
[2:00:29] going through the trials. I just knew it
[2:00:31] cuz he was mad at everybody when he was
[2:00:34] going through the trials. Yeah.
[2:00:37] mean. Then we got done with the trial.
[2:00:39] He was so kind, so nice. Oh yeah. And as
[2:00:43] a little boy, I said, "Father, God,
[2:00:44] please don't let me be like that man. I
[2:00:47] don't want what he
[2:00:48] got." And I'm a little boy. I remember
[2:00:52] another family. Every time they went to
[2:00:54] the draw, they left over Oklahoma and
[2:00:55] went to
[2:00:56] Missouri. I just figured that's where it
[2:00:58] was misery,
[2:01:00] the state of misery.
[2:01:03] They just all go to Missouri. And then
[2:01:04] when the trial was over, give it a
[2:01:06] couple years, they're back prophesying,
[2:01:08] dancing, shouting as a boy sitting on
[2:01:10] the front
[2:01:11] row, I saw them
[2:01:14] things. I said, "Oh, God, if I ever give
[2:01:17] my heart to you, I don't want to be
[2:01:19] that." Amen. I want something real.
[2:01:24] You understand what I'm saying? And
[2:01:26] there were people that I could idolize.
[2:01:28] said when I say idolized that I could
[2:01:29] follow because they had the goods
[2:01:33] in the trials they were still faithful
[2:01:36] in the ups and downs they still remained
[2:01:40] they never got in the clicks never got
[2:01:42] involved in the in the things that were
[2:01:44] going in on in the church and never got
[2:01:46] involved in worldly you never knew when
[2:01:49] they were going through a trial they
[2:01:51] were just so sweet they were so kind
[2:01:54] oh
[2:01:55] God if there's Anyway, you just allow me
[2:01:59] to be that. Amen. And them people are
[2:02:03] still idols to me. And when I say idols,
[2:02:05] I know some of you say, "Well,
[2:02:07] idol." What I mean is I still follow
[2:02:10] them. I want to follow them. Lord,
[2:02:12] they're still before me to say, "Oh,
[2:02:14] God, let me be that." Because I see that
[2:02:17] they follow you.
[2:02:20] Can you say amen?
[2:02:23] You see, Brother Brandham said, "Many
[2:02:24] people won't go to church." Well,
[2:02:27] they've got a wrong impression of church
[2:02:29] and that's getting more and more right.
[2:02:32] They think it's the women down there are
[2:02:34] witches and men are black robed demons
[2:02:37] and they just got the wrong idea about
[2:02:39] it. But I tell you what they do do. They
[2:02:42] will watch your life to see what you do.
[2:02:45] I believe it was Paul that said, "We are
[2:02:46] written epistles of God read of all
[2:02:48] men." Amen. And when you're on the
[2:02:50] street, when you're at work, wherever
[2:02:52] you are, somebody is watching you.
[2:02:56] And especially after you have said and
[2:02:58] made your confession that you are a
[2:02:59] Christian, they'll watch you that much
[2:03:01] closer then. And that gives you an
[2:03:03] influence to the people that's around
[2:03:05] about you. Well, why? Because they want
[2:03:08] real. They want reality. They want
[2:03:10] something that's true.
[2:03:12] They've seen so much fake out there.
[2:03:15] Yeah.
[2:03:17] And he says, "And we should watch what
[2:03:18] we do because if we produce the wrong
[2:03:21] influence, then we bring reproach not
[2:03:23] upon ourselves or not so much upon
[2:03:25] ourselves but upon what we claim to be
[2:03:28] Christians. We bring it upon Christ. And
[2:03:31] no one see if we would think you you
[2:03:34] would never want to bring a reproach
[2:03:35] upon Christ. But the wrong
[2:03:38] act will certainly cause a wrong
[2:03:41] reflection towards the person that's
[2:03:43] watching you." And everybody is watched
[2:03:46] when you profess to be a Christian.
[2:03:48] That's right. So then we realize that as
[2:03:50] Christians, we're not living for
[2:03:52] ourselves. We're living for those that
[2:03:54] are watching us.
[2:03:57] Can you say amen? You don't even have to
[2:04:00] say you're a Christian. There's people
[2:04:02] that watch you anyways. Yes. I
[2:04:07] um at a restaurant and we we go there
[2:04:10] quite a bit. Uh, I mean, when we do,
[2:04:12] we'd go there
[2:04:14] and never even talked to the waitress
[2:04:16] about the Lord or nothing. But I
[2:04:19] remember, you know, and and they looked
[2:04:21] that both of them looked really hard in
[2:04:23] life, just had they really had a hard
[2:04:26] time through life. And but I remember
[2:04:28] one time one of the waitresses come and
[2:04:31] she just cried and she says, "Would you
[2:04:33] please pray for me?" Amen.
[2:04:36] Well,
[2:04:37] sure. She said, "Me and my husband's
[2:04:39] going through divorce and it's just so
[2:04:43] hard." And I said, "Yes, ma'am." I said,
[2:04:45] "We'll pray." But who would have ever
[2:04:48] thought that she would come to us for
[2:04:51] prayer? We never talked about the Lord.
[2:04:54] We never talked about anything. I hope
[2:04:56] you understand.
[2:04:59] If the musicians will come, I know we
[2:05:01] got a lot, but it's okay because you've
[2:05:05] only got one service today.
[2:05:08] That's right.
[2:05:10] But 1 Corinthians 8:6 says, "But to us
[2:05:13] there is but one God, the Father of whom
[2:05:16] are all things, and we in him, and one
[2:05:20] Lord Jesus Christ, by whom are all
[2:05:22] things, and we by
[2:05:24] him." How be there is not in every man
[2:05:27] that knowledge. Now notice this is Paul
[2:05:30] talking. How be it there is not in every
[2:05:33] man that knowledge. For some with
[2:05:36] conscience of the idol unto this hour,
[2:05:39] eat it eat
[2:05:42] things eat it as a thing offered unto an
[2:05:47] idol. And their conscience being weak is
[2:05:50] defiled. But meat commendeth us not to
[2:05:54] God. For neither if we eat are we the
[2:05:56] better, neither if we eat not are are we
[2:06:00] the worse.
[2:06:02] But take heed lest by any man means this
[2:06:06] liberty of yours. See it. So so let's
[2:06:09] say you're eating some kind of uh food.
[2:06:12] But but it's it's a food that others
[2:06:15] have offered it to their idols.
[2:06:18] And so maybe this young Christian or
[2:06:21] whatever, you know, but maybe someone's
[2:06:24] sitting there watching you do this and
[2:06:25] they all of a sudden get defend offended
[2:06:27] by this because they used to use it for
[2:06:30] bad things.
[2:06:32] [Music]
[2:06:34] And yet, you know, it ain't going to
[2:06:36] hurt you. You know, I
[2:06:38] mean, you
[2:06:42] understand? And so, but Paul is saying,
[2:06:44] "But now take take heed, lest by any
[2:06:47] means this liberty of yours become a
[2:06:49] stumbling block to them that are weak.
[2:06:52] For if any man see the which hath
[2:06:55] knowledge sit at meat in the idol's
[2:06:58] temple, shall not the conscience of him
[2:07:01] which is weak be emboldened to eat those
[2:07:03] things which are offered to idols? And
[2:07:06] through thy knowledge shall the weak
[2:07:08] brother perish for whom Christ
[2:07:11] died. I'll say that again. Through thy
[2:07:13] knowledge, everybody say through thy
[2:07:15] knowledge shall the weak brother perish
[2:07:17] for whom Christ died. But when you sin
[2:07:20] so against the brethren and wound their
[2:07:22] weak conscience, you sin against Christ.
[2:07:25] Wherefore if meat make my brother to
[2:07:28] offend, I will eat no flesh, while the
[2:07:31] world standeth, lest I make my brother
[2:07:33] to offend. So the whole point of
[2:07:37] this that I wanted to bring out is Paul
[2:07:40] was careful and and was teaching us to
[2:07:43] be careful not to use our
[2:07:45] liberties or to be careful how we use
[2:07:48] our
[2:07:51] liberties, right?
[2:07:54] Because if if our liberties is going to
[2:07:59] be a stumbling block to
[2:08:03] somebody, then we can't we we've got to
[2:08:06] be careful to say, "Well, that brother
[2:08:08] needs to grow up." But maybe maybe he's
[2:08:11] not as matured as you. Maybe he's not
[2:08:14] come to that knowledge that you have.
[2:08:17] And so, as the the Bible says, bear with
[2:08:20] those that are weak, right?
[2:08:23] [Music]
[2:08:25] So then we find
[2:08:27] that Paul because he had such a love for
[2:08:31] the people, he had a real respect.
[2:08:34] Everybody say respect. He had a respect
[2:08:37] for the people. Now brother Brown says
[2:08:40] what we need is a love and respect for
[2:08:42] God and for his people.
[2:08:45] See, your ministry, if I just, you know,
[2:08:48] to you young ministers or whatever, your
[2:08:51] ministry will not be effective if there
[2:08:54] isn't a respect for the person you're
[2:08:56] trying to influence. And that goes for
[2:08:58] all of us. If if if we're trying to win
[2:09:02] souls, there has to be a respect for
[2:09:05] that
[2:09:06] individual. And you cannot have respect
[2:09:09] until you have fear. Can you say amen?
[2:09:13] So, as a solid Christian, it may not
[2:09:15] hurt for you to miss
[2:09:18] church. But what about those that are
[2:09:21] watching you? What about the weak ones
[2:09:23] that don't
[2:09:27] understand that really need church? I
[2:09:30] think everybody needs church.
[2:09:33] But see, and and and so what what are we
[2:09:36] putting before them? Then if we're not
[2:09:38] careful, we're using our liberties to be
[2:09:40] a stumbling
[2:09:43] block. You with
[2:09:45] [Music]
[2:09:47] me? It may not hurt you to walk into a
[2:09:50] bar and say hi to an individual or
[2:09:53] whatever, but what would the sinner
[2:09:56] think when they're sitting there
[2:09:58] watching you go into it? It may not hurt
[2:10:01] you to do certain things or whatever. It
[2:10:03] may not hurt. You know, someone might
[2:10:06] say, "Well, I I you know, I can get out
[2:10:08] on the beach. I'm a matured Christian. I
[2:10:10] can get out on the beach and with all
[2:10:11] these half- naked women. It ain't going
[2:10:13] to hurt me." But what about that
[2:10:14] individual that's watching
[2:10:17] you? How's that affecting? So, see, we
[2:10:20] need the love of
[2:10:21] God to constrain
[2:10:23] [Music]
[2:10:27] us. Hope you understand. This is what
[2:10:31] brother Brandham said.
[2:10:36] He quotes Ecclesiastes. He said, "Let us
[2:10:39] hear the conclusion of the whole matter.
[2:10:41] Fear God and keep his commandments, for
[2:10:42] this is the full duty of
[2:10:44] man." The conclusion of the whole matter
[2:10:47] is to fear God. And when you cannot have
[2:10:50] respects, he said, "And you cannot have
[2:10:53] respects until you have fear." You've
[2:10:55] got to have fear of God. Solomon said
[2:10:58] also in Proverbs that the fear of God is
[2:11:00] the beginning of wisdom. The fear of God
[2:11:02] is the beginning of
[2:11:04] wisdom. He said, "Now, that doesn't mean
[2:11:06] that you're afraid of him, but that
[2:11:10] means that you're given respects and
[2:11:12] reverence. And when you respect God, you
[2:11:14] fear God. You fear that you might
[2:11:16] displease him in some way. You fear lest
[2:11:18] you would do something wrong." See, he
[2:11:21] said, "I fear my mother. I fear my wife.
[2:11:24] I fear my church. I fear all of God's
[2:11:26] servants unless I should put some a
[2:11:28] stumbling block somewhere in their way.
[2:11:31] I fear the people. I fear the people of
[2:11:33] this city unless I should do something
[2:11:35] wrong that would cause them to think
[2:11:37] that I wasn't a Christian. See you. He
[2:11:41] said before you could have respects, you
[2:11:42] got to have fear. God demands it. He
[2:11:44] demands respects. God does. He demands
[2:11:48] it and fear brings it. And we know that
[2:11:50] fear brings respects.
[2:11:53] I'm going to go one more quote
[2:11:55] [Music]
[2:11:57] tonight. He said, "Many times I'd go to
[2:11:59] houses and there are women standing out
[2:12:02] there." He says, "And I go to the house,
[2:12:04] knock on the door, and a sister would
[2:12:06] come to the
[2:12:08] door and say, "Come in, Brother
[2:12:10] Brandham." Well, if her husband is not
[2:12:12] there, unless it's a case of sickness or
[2:12:15] somebody with me, I don't go. I don't go
[2:12:17] in. And then they call me to a hospital
[2:12:20] or to a room and say, "Brother Brandon,
[2:12:22] come over here. I'm Sister so and so
[2:12:24] from so and so. I'm here at the hotel. I
[2:12:28] brought my mother along. She's sick. I
[2:12:30] Well, I take my wife. If I don't, I take
[2:12:32] some other
[2:12:33] brother. He said, "Now, see, I I think
[2:12:36] it would be all right for me to go in
[2:12:38] there." So, now he's saying, "I've got a
[2:12:40] liberty to do this. I think it'd be okay
[2:12:43] for me to to go in there, but what if
[2:12:46] some somebody seen me go in there? Well,
[2:12:49] what if what if somebody seen me do it?
[2:12:51] Then the first thing, you know, they
[2:12:52] would say, "He went in there where that
[2:12:54] woman was. He's chasing after women."
[2:12:57] Well, see, then what happens? He runs
[2:12:59] his his effect upon that
[2:13:03] individual, and he's saying, "I I don't
[2:13:06] want to use my liberty in that way. I
[2:13:08] want to win people to
[2:13:10] Christ." Right?
[2:13:12] [Music]
[2:13:14] So he says, you know, uh uh he went in
[2:13:16] there where that womb was. He's chasing
[2:13:18] after women. That would be a thing I
[2:13:20] shouldn't do. You should never do
[2:13:23] anything like that because you put a
[2:13:25] stumbling block or a stumbling in
[2:13:27] somebody else's way. I don't believe
[2:13:29] that I would do anything wrong in there.
