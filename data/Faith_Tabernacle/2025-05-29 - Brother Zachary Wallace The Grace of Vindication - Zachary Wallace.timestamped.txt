[29:22] promised to be. But I asked you where is
[29:25] here. Does it mean the building? Does it
[29:28] mean the state? No. It means right here.
[29:34] He promised that he would be with you
[29:35] even in you to the end of the
[29:39] age. Let's just go to the Lord in a word
[29:42] of
[29:42] prayer. Lord Jesus, we just we want to
[29:46] make you welcome, Lord.
[29:49] Lord, you promised that you would be
[29:50] here in the midst of two or three
[29:52] gathered together. And Lord, we want to
[29:54] make you welcome as you promised you
[29:56] would come. Father, may we not just take
[29:59] it for granted or just look at it as
[30:01] another day, Lord, but may we entertain
[30:04] your presence here tonight, Lord. And
[30:06] may we recognize the opportunity we have
[30:09] to receive from you in divine presence.
[30:11] We just pray, Lord, that you would bless
[30:13] your word to our hearts, Lord. May it be
[30:16] something that would be helpful to us in
[30:19] our daily life, Lord. And I pray you
[30:21] would increase our fa faith tonight in
[30:24] Jesus Christ's name.
[30:26] Amen. God bless you. I bring you
[30:29] greetings from our home church there in
[30:31] in Ohio at True Word Tabernacle with
[30:35] brother Wayne Lawson. It's a been a
[30:38] recent change for us to be there, but
[30:40] it's been good. been enjoying the uh the
[30:43] fellowship of the saints and and you
[30:45] know we we have a lot of different
[30:46] gatherings but there's only one church
[30:49] and we're all a part of that same church
[30:51] and it's the body of the Lord Jesus
[30:53] Christ. If you could turn to Malachi the
[30:56] 4th chapter we'll take a text from there
[30:59] and uh reading a
[31:01] scripture but we back on uh on Sunday we
[31:05] were in Arizona. My brother got married
[31:07] on Saturday and we were up in there on
[31:10] Sunday and then we jumped in the car
[31:12] Monday and we drove all the way out
[31:13] here. So, we've seen quite a few miles
[31:15] in the last couple of days. But, uh,
[31:18] we're glad to be here and I guess
[31:21] brother Shawn flew over flew over us as
[31:24] we were driving out here. So, kind of
[31:26] people coming and going, but uh we know
[31:30] that it really doesn't matter a whole
[31:32] lot who's standing up here as long as
[31:34] the Lord's able to speak to the heart.
[31:36] And so, we just trust that he'll do that
[31:39] this evening for us. Amen. If we look in
[31:41] Malachi the 4th chapter, very familiar
[31:43] scripture verse four and five uh the
[31:46] whole chapter gives us context, but
[31:48] verses uh five and six, behold, I will
[31:51] send you Elijah the prophet before the
[31:52] coming of the great and dreadful day of
[31:54] the Lord. And he shall turn the heart of
[31:56] the fathers to the children, and the
[31:58] heart of the children to the fathers,
[32:00] lest I come and smite the earth with a
[32:03] curse. You can be seated. Uh it says
[32:07] here, I will before that great and
[32:09] dreadful day. So, we know there's a
[32:11] great and a dreadful day coming. And a
[32:14] great and a dreadful day is a bad day,
[32:17] brother Levi. A great and dreadful day
[32:19] is a bad day. You don't want to be here
[32:21] for a great and a dreadful day. But we
[32:23] know it's coming. And we see signs, we
[32:25] see evidences, we things pointing in
[32:27] that direction, showing us that there's
[32:29] a great and a dreadful day coming. We we
[32:31] call it the last days. We call it the
[32:33] end of time. And uh my my cousin in
[32:36] Arizona, he was getting me up to date on
[32:38] a lot of things because I don't uh I'm
[32:40] not real good on current events or
[32:42] what's going on in technology, but he
[32:44] was he was explaining to me and
[32:46] expressing where things are at right now
[32:47] in technology and especially with uh uh
[32:50] Elon Musk and he was telling me how
[32:52] these driverless cars are actually
[32:54] they've got the technology. They're in
[32:55] operation. They they've they've
[32:57] completed they've passed the tests and
[32:59] they're now functioning. and they're
[33:00] driving around driverless cars, uh,
[33:02] driverless taxis, and they're picking up
[33:04] people, dropping them off. It's in
[33:06] operation. And, and then he showed me
[33:07] something that I I had no idea about.
[33:10] And it's it's something called Optimus.
[33:12] It's a it's a robot that looks like a
[33:14] human that they have created. And it
[33:17] acts like a human. It has functionality,
[33:19] arms, legs, everything. It can jump up,
[33:21] dance a jig, spin around in a circle
[33:23] just like a human would. It can grab an
[33:25] egg, crack an egg, make an omelette.
[33:28] They've made it to be a a a working
[33:31] robot. So for 25 $30,000, you can buy a
[33:35] worker and he can work on any task you
[33:38] need. So Josiah, you've got workers
[33:40] coming up in the near future, you know,
[33:42] you can you can buy this and you don't
[33:43] it's a one-time cost, you know, and then
[33:45] a little bit of maintenance. But it's
[33:47] and this isn't something that there's
[33:49] theoretical. They're expecting to have
[33:51] thousands of them completed by the end
[33:52] of the year. Blew me away. I had no idea
[33:56] that technology was there. So, I started
[33:58] looking into it and I started seeing
[33:59] some of the videos of of what this this
[34:01] new robotic technology is capable of.
[34:04] And and I just realized the the
[34:06] potential for changes in this day. If
[34:10] you got a driverless car, you know, you
[34:12] could upload that technology to a lot of
[34:14] places and you look at your uh your your
[34:16] your truck drivers, you look at your a
[34:18] lot of your machinery, your operators,
[34:20] your taxi drivers. all these different
[34:21] jobs could be replaced by these
[34:23] driverless cars. And then you look at
[34:25] this uh this Optimus robot that can that
[34:28] can make you breakfast and do your
[34:30] laundry and it's like, man, this is this
[34:32] is quite incredible. And and and you
[34:33] know, construction workers or mining
[34:35] operations or dangerous tasks that
[34:37] normally would be would be dangerous
[34:38] because people forget a little detail.
[34:40] Well, these guys don't forget little
[34:41] details, so that's helpful. And and just
[34:43] the the potential for change and
[34:45] upheaval within the world as we know it.
[34:50] And then they were th this this the same
[34:52] guy uh Musk, he was he's working on a
[34:55] whole program for Mars colonization.
[34:58] They he's actively working. It's not
[35:00] just a maybe someday we should do this.
[35:01] He has millions upon millions of dollars
[35:03] poured into a a a a space base where
[35:07] they're planning on how to get to Mars
[35:08] to set up a colonization there and get
[35:10] away from this Earth because they think
[35:12] that this Earth is in trouble.
[35:15] And somebody was t uh touring the the
[35:17] the space base that they have set up
[35:20] that they're they're planning operations
[35:22] and and they were asking him, you know,
[35:24] Mr. Mr. Musk, uh some people have
[35:27] compared you to Noah who built an ark to
[35:30] save the save the earth and they've
[35:32] compared you to that. They said, "What
[35:34] do you think about that?" And he just
[35:36] stood there for a while and he says,
[35:37] "Well, I really don't know."
[35:41] And it just kind of struck me hearing
[35:43] these things and hearing where
[35:46] technology is at and where the earth is
[35:48] at right now and recognizing that people
[35:51] know the hour they're in. I mean, this
[35:53] guy has recognized that we need to get
[35:55] off this earth and we need to go
[35:56] somewhere else and start over again
[35:58] because it's we're in trouble here. We
[36:00] need to rapture. We need to get away
[36:01] from here. They recognize this, but
[36:03] they're trying to achieve it by human
[36:05] ability. They're trying to achieve a
[36:07] utopia here on earth without overcoming
[36:10] sin. They're trying to have a utopia
[36:11] without the blood of Jesus Christ.
[36:13] They're looking for a perfect place.
[36:16] And they're trying. And man was created
[36:18] in the image of God. And and before the
[36:20] Tower of Babel, God said, "We better
[36:22] stop them because anything they imagine
[36:23] in their hearts, they'll do." And that's
[36:25] where they're getting back to. And it
[36:28] just kind of indicates, it gives a
[36:30] little pointer at the hour that we're
[36:32] living in as the last days. Amen. And uh
[36:35] you look in here in the book of Luke
[36:38] 21:2 and says, "There shall be signs in
[36:41] the sun and in the moon and in the stars
[36:42] and upon the earth, distress of nations
[36:45] with perplexity, the sea and the waves
[36:48] roaring, men's hearts failing them for
[36:50] fear, and for looking after those things
[36:52] which are coming on the earth. For the
[36:53] powers of heaven shall be shaken, and
[36:56] they shall see the Son of Man coming in
[36:59] a cloud with power and great glory." And
[37:03] when these things begin to come to pass,
[37:06] then look up and lift up your heads for
[37:08] your redemption drawth nigh. So friends,
[37:12] what time is it? It's time to lift up
[37:14] your heads. It's times not to look at
[37:16] the things of this earth and everything
[37:17] that's going around us. We we recognize
[37:19] that we're in this hour, but we need to
[37:21] look up, lift up our heads and realize
[37:22] that our redemption is drawing nigh. Our
[37:25] redemption, our full restoration is
[37:28] right here.
[37:29] Now, brother Brandham here in the sermon
[37:32] spiritual food in due season, he says,
[37:34] "I want you to get built up now this in
[37:36] the holy oracles of God in the faith,
[37:38] the faith of this hour, the faith. It's
[37:42] going to take more faith than ever was
[37:44] in any age for this has to be rapturing
[37:47] faith be taken up." And so we want you
[37:50] to believe tonight in all that you have
[37:52] seen heard the word that you have heard
[37:55] preached, the signs and wonders that you
[37:57] have seen. We want you to accumulate all
[38:00] that together in your heart and consider
[38:03] it whether if that be God or not. A and
[38:08] so I want to to to take that as my
[38:11] inspiration right there that we want to
[38:13] I'm not I'm not trying to express
[38:14] anything that's new to you. you you're
[38:15] familiar with these things, but I want
[38:17] to accumulate it all together tonight. I
[38:19] just want to look at what we've seen,
[38:20] the word we've heard, accumulate that
[38:23] all together in our heart because it's
[38:24] going to take a special kind of faith.
[38:26] It's going to take a special kind of
[38:28] confidence to take this rapture, a
[38:30] rapturing faith, a rapturing confidence.
[38:32] It's going and and if we look and we
[38:34] accumulate all these things together of
[38:36] what God's been doing, it'll affect your
[38:39] faith. And I want to look at uh for a
[38:42] sermon title tonight. I want to speak on
[38:44] the grace of vindication. The grace of
[38:48] vindication. Now uh if we if we see here
[38:51] in uh Revelations chapter 1:14, we see
[38:54] that that John he seen that angel
[38:56] standing there and he seen he he looked
[38:58] and it was one walking among the
[39:01] candlesticks and he realized that this
[39:02] was the the son of man and and he was
[39:05] clothed with with a white wig, a white
[39:08] wig of authority. and and and you know,
[39:12] brother Brandham, I was I was reading
[39:14] here and in the in the sermon of the of
[39:18] uh spiritual food in due season, and he
[39:19] was talking about how he didn't know
[39:21] what that was, and he just really wasn't
[39:23] sure. And you know what? He didn't just
[39:25] make something up.
[39:27] You see, the prophet had a special
[39:29] school that he went to, very special
[39:31] kind of a school that went to where he
[39:33] learned these things. And and uh I uh if
[39:37] you have that first slide there, I have
[39:39] the quote here. I'm going to try and get
[39:41] a few of these up tonight. But brother
[39:43] says here, uh, so you see, I had no way
[39:45] of learning from any school, but I, oh,
[39:47] I love that school I went to. Oh, back
[39:50] out yonder in a little cave somewhere,
[39:52] my hands up to God day in and day out
[39:55] like that when the Holy Spirit come down
[39:57] in his sweetness and began to reveal
[39:59] himself and saying, "Thus is thus, and
[40:02] thus is thus." Amen.
[40:05] It's quite a school to go to. Amen. You
[40:08] see, the prophet of God didn't preach
[40:09] these things just by his intellect. He
[40:11] didn't just preach them because, well, I
[40:13] don't know, maybe I'll preach this or
[40:14] this will be my best guess or this is
[40:16] what Jack Moore said. No, he didn't
[40:18] preach it that way. He went down and he
[40:20] waited until the Lord began to reveal
[40:22] it. And he said he in this spiritual
[40:24] food and due season he was talking
[40:25] about, he says, "Oh Lord, I've got a
[40:27] responsibility before the people. What
[40:29] is this w white white one that's
[40:31] standing there when how do I express
[40:33] this?" And he was trying to understand
[40:34] it. And as he was praying about it, then
[40:37] he said, "I looked up and standing
[40:39] before me there stood a man and he was a
[40:41] judge and he had a white wig on and and
[40:44] the Lord begins to give him a visitation
[40:47] by a vision to show him what this is."
[40:50] And so then he stands up and he tells
[40:52] the people, "I know what it is. I know
[40:54] what it's about." And he tells them it
[40:56] was it was a white wig of authority.
[41:00] Now, he didn't know that until the Lord
[41:02] revealed it to him. But you see the
[41:04] sincerity he had. He said, "Lord, I've
[41:06] got a responsibility to the people." Oh,
[41:10] and he was faithful to that
[41:12] responsibility. He didn't just tell us
[41:14] something because somebody else said so.
[41:16] He told us when the Lord revealed it to
[41:19] him. And you can f look at this in many
[41:21] different places. Uh he talked about how
[41:23] for years he didn't even preach about
[41:24] hell because he wasn't sure how it fit
[41:26] in. Amen.
[41:28] Waited until the Lord revealed it to
[41:29] him. But as the Lord would reveal it to
[41:31] him, then he could preach it. And so I'm
[41:34] showing you this to show you that we
[41:35] have a courage. We have a confidence. We
[41:37] have a trust. We can have a faith in the
[41:40] word we've received because it's been
[41:42] vindicated by supreme authority. The
[41:44] word that we have, it's not just the
[41:47] words of a man, but it's the word of
[41:49] God. And and now we can see thoroughly
[41:52] the vindication of this message of the
[41:55] hour that we have. Now the word
[41:57] vindication, it's used in a court case.
[42:00] And let's say that uh Levi and Hudson
[42:03] here, come here. So, we have a court
[42:05] case and and we're over here and and the
[42:09] the the the the defendant comes up and
[42:11] and he says, "Now, you're the defendant
[42:14] today." Okay? You are guilty of uh
[42:16] punching Tarsa. All right? And you were
[42:20] the one who did it. You're the one who
[42:21] punched her. And we're going to We know
[42:23] that it was a Wednesday night about uh
[42:25] 7:45 and and you were over there hitting
[42:27] Tiraza. And so that's the accusation.
[42:30] But then somebody will come up and be
[42:32] like, "Wait a minute. Wait a minute. I
[42:34] was there at 7:45 on a Wednesday night
[42:37] and Tears was in the back of the
[42:39] building. Levi was in the front of the
[42:40] building. He didn't do it. He's not
[42:42] guilty." And so when it's cleared and
[42:45] and maybe they pull up the live stream
[42:47] and they're like, "Okay, watch 7:45. You
[42:48] see this right here? See? See? He never
[42:50] did it. She was back there." Ah, okay.
[42:52] Well, he's been vindicated to have been
[42:56] innocent. Amen. he's been vindicated
[42:58] that he didn't do it. Or he could he
[43:00] could make a statement. He could make a
[43:01] claim and say, "Hey, listen. I was not
[43:03] the one who did that." And he makes his
[43:05] claim, but then when when when the case
[43:07] comes together and it's proved out that
[43:09] he didn't do it, now his word's been
[43:12] vindicated or proved to be right. And
[43:16] your word was able to be a witness to
[43:18] testify that he wasn't guilty. And now
[43:21] he's been vindicated that he didn't do
[43:23] it, which is a good thing in this case.
[43:26] and thanks. So vindication is used in a
[43:29] court case many times to show somebody's
[43:32] what they did or didn't do and and that
[43:34] they were vindicated to be in the right.
[43:37] And it's also word used in the in the
[43:39] context of of just showing that
[43:42] something is is reasonable or something
[43:44] is justified. Uh you know they were
[43:46] vindicated in their action that that was
[43:48] the right decision to make. So it's
[43:50] showing that something is right. Now
[43:54] what what is right and wrong? What is
[43:56] truth? What what is that? Well, it comes
[44:00] from supreme authority or the sovereign
[44:02] God. And and and I want to look at how
[44:06] God has ma given us evidences. He's
[44:09] given us proofs that his word is true.
[44:12] He's given us vindications. But God
[44:14] doesn't have to do anything. God God is
[44:18] not required to do anything. He is a
[44:20] sovereign God. And there's nobody that
[44:22] has can tell him how to do something or
[44:25] what to do or that he needs to do a
[44:27] certain thing. No, nobody can do that.
[44:29] And I'm just going to go through a
[44:30] string of quotes here showing the
[44:31] sovereignty of God. And so we're just
[44:33] going to go right through them here.
[44:34] Here in Jehovah Gyra, he says God
[44:36] doesn't have to explain nothing. He is
[44:39] God. He says God don't have to take back
[44:42] his word for nobody. God said how he
[44:44] would come and that's the way it'll
[44:46] come. See, God don't have to tell you
[44:48] everything. So, he don't even tell his
[44:50] prophets everything. He just does what
[44:52] he wants to do. He's God. But God don't
[44:55] have to do things the way you've been
[44:57] taught. He does it the way he says he
[44:59] will in the Bible. God has to keep his
[45:03] word. God doesn't have to heal to prove
[45:05] his power, but he has to heal to keep
[45:08] his word. That's right. God don't have
[45:10] to prove nothing. He's God. God was able
[45:14] to of these stones to raise children to
[45:15] Abraham. God don't have to come through
[45:17] your group or no other group. He is God.
[45:20] He does what he wants to and he will.
[45:23] Amen. Again, Lord God, let them know
[45:26] that the message of God don't have to
[45:27] come out of their organization or ranks.
[45:30] You raise what you want to do. You're
[45:33] God. Amen. Again, he said, uh, you who
[45:36] prophesies, tell us who hits you. The
[45:38] devil is the same one that said, come
[45:40] down off the cross and we'll believe
[45:41] you. God doesn't have to do anything to
[45:44] appease man. God doesn't clown for
[45:47] anybody. He's God and he doesn't have
[45:50] to.
[45:52] God is sovereign. Amen. Nobody can tell
[45:54] him what to do. Nobody can say, "Hey, I
[45:57] want you to prove it to me." Uh-uh.
[45:59] Wrong person. You're talking to the
[46:00] wrong person. God is sovereign. And
[46:03] sovereign means it can do whatever it
[46:05] wants to. And nobody can tell him that
[46:07] he can't do it. And therefore, by God's
[46:09] sovereignty, he has a grace. He has a
[46:12] sovereign grace for mankind. He can save
[46:14] whoever he wants to, no matter how
[46:16] sinful, no matter how terrible that
[46:18] person is. The sovereign God can come
[46:20] down with sovereign grace and say, "I'm
[46:22] choosing that one to be my child."
[46:26] Sovereign grace is from a sovereign ones
[46:28] and it can do anything it wants to
[46:30] because it's sovereign.
[46:33] So when God speaks, it is the truth.
[46:36] Does anybody want to argue that point?
[46:39] When God speaks, it's the truth. When he
[46:41] says, "Let there be light," there's
[46:43] going to be light. When he says, "Let
[46:44] there be sun, moon, and stars," they're
[46:46] going to be there. When he says, "My
[46:48] word was sent to heal your diseases,"
[46:51] well, that's what it's going to do. When
[46:53] God says something, it stands true.
[46:56] There is no question about that. It is
[46:59] the truth. And he doesn't have to prove
[47:01] it to anybody. God now, God could just
[47:04] speak it and let it stand. believe it or
[47:07] not, take it or not, like it or not,
[47:09] it's still the truth.
[47:12] But but that's not how God does it. He
[47:16] speaks it. And you know, I I tend to be
[47:19] a little bit this way with uh you know,
[47:22] with my children because I'm like, you
[47:24] know, you got to learn sometime or
[47:26] other. And so I'll tell them, hey,
[47:27] listen, you know, the the stove's hot.
[47:30] And they can either believe me or not.
[47:33] And you know what happens if they don't
[47:34] believe me? They find out I was right,
[47:37] but they find out the hard way. And I
[47:39] can lean a little bit into that because
[47:41] I'm like, "Hey, you know, at some point
[47:43] you got to learn to believe what I'm
[47:44] telling you." And God could just let it
[47:46] be that way. Tell you, "Hey, hell's hot
[47:49] and don't go there." And then just leave
[47:51] it to you to figure out. But you know
[47:53] what? He doesn't do it that way. God
[47:56] could send a messenger without
[47:58] vindicating him, without proving him.
[48:00] Just send the messenger. the messenger
[48:02] would speak the word of God and it would
[48:03] be the truth and that would be it. Just
[48:06] take it or leave it. But God doesn't do
[48:08] it that way. Why? Why? Why is it that
[48:10] God would spend all this time to
[48:12] vindicate or prove that this was a
[48:14] messenger from him? It's called grace.
[48:17] It's the goodness of God, the kindness
[48:19] of God that vindicates his word and
[48:21] proves it to be the truth so that you
[48:23] can have faith to believe it. You look
[48:26] in uh Exodus chapter 4 and 21, the Lord
[48:30] comes to Moses and and he he said,
[48:32] "Listen, uh go into Egypt and Pharaoh's
[48:34] not going to listen to you. He's going
[48:35] to harden your heart and and you're
[48:37] going to say these things to to Pharaoh.
[48:38] Let my people go and even my firstborn."
[48:41] In Exodus 4:23, "And I said unto them,
[48:43] let my son go that he may serve me. And
[48:46] if thou refuse to let him go, behold, I
[48:48] will slay thy son, even thy firstborn."
[48:51] This is before anything's happened. This
[48:53] is just right at the beginning. listen.
[48:54] You're going to go in there. He's going
[48:56] to harden his heart. He's not going to
[48:57] listen. Tell him if he doesn't listen,
[48:58] he's going to lose his firstborn. All
[49:00] right? And so we God already knew the
[49:03] end of the story. God already knew what
[49:05] was going to get his attention. God knew
[49:07] what was going to be the final plague
[49:08] that would get a hold of him and and he
[49:10] would believe it. So why didn't God just
[49:12] start out with the 10th plague? Just get
[49:14] it over with. Well, for one thing, if
[49:18] Moses had walked out of the wilderness
[49:20] and he'd just come out of there, he say,
[49:22] "Listen, kill a lamb and put blood all
[49:24] over your house." Like, what? What
[49:28] happened to that guy? You know, Levi,
[49:31] you got to do this. You got to go and
[49:32] kill a kill a lamb and put blood all
[49:34] over your door. And you're like, "My
[49:35] dad's going to kill me. What about the
[49:36] death angel? I don't know. Like, I can't
[49:38] do this. Like, this is a terrible idea."
[49:40] But after God had began to vindicate, I
[49:43] think it was the first three or four
[49:44] plagues also were in Gan. And the
[49:47] children of Israel began to see when
[49:48] that man speaks, something happens. When
[49:51] that man speaks, there's frogs. When
[49:52] that man speaks, there's blood. When
[49:54] that man speaks, there's there's there's
[49:56] all these plagues are happening. And
[49:57] then God put a separation between Goan
[50:00] and Pharaoh. And they began to witness
[50:02] the power of God. They began to witness
[50:04] that when Moses said something, come on,
[50:07] there's a reality behind it. And so when
[50:09] Moses walks up and says, "Listen, you
[50:11] either put blood on your door or you
[50:12] die." He says, "I'm putting blood on the
[50:14] door." Because the prophet had been
[50:16] vindicated.
[50:18] Oh, the grace of God that vindicates his
[50:21] word so that the people will believe it
[50:23] because to refuse it is death. And so
[50:26] God by his grace vindicates it to them
[50:28] so that they will recognize that word.
[50:32] That's right. You know, everybody
[50:34] believed Noah's message after the rain
[50:37] started. Yeah, that's right. The
[50:40] vindication of Noah's message was rain
[50:43] falling down and flood waters rising.
[50:45] But at that hour, when they recognized
[50:47] it, it was too late to receive it. Amen.
[50:51] The door had already been closed. It's
[50:54] the grace of God that vindicates his
[50:56] word to you so that you can receive it
[50:59] in the hour that you're living in. the
[51:01] Lord. Look at the let's look at the
[51:03] story of Gideon here. Uh it's one of the
[51:05] more compelling stories I can see of
[51:08] vindication. And God comes to Gideon and
[51:11] he says, you know, thou mighty man of
[51:13] valor. He says, uh me. He's like, yes,
[51:16] you. And and uh they begin to have this
[51:18] discussion and he says, well, Lord, if
[51:20] you're really with us, you know, if if
[51:22] you're really here, then then give me a
[51:24] a sign. Give me some vindication. He
[51:27] said, "All right." Uh, and he goes and
[51:29] he gets some food together and he makes
[51:31] a sacrifice and he sets it all in order
[51:33] and he and fire comes down and consumes
[51:35] it and the angel disappears which was
[51:37] the angel of the Lord. It was the Lord
[51:39] himself standing there talking to Gideon
[51:40] and and Gideon's saying, you know, if
[51:42] the Lord be with us, then where are the
[51:44] miracles? He's talking to him face to
[51:45] face and and he says, "Show me a sign
[51:48] that thou talkest to me." And and God
[51:49] answers him. God gives him a vindication
[51:54] that it's really him that's speaking to
[51:55] him.
[51:56] And so the and it says the Lord there
[51:59] there rose fire out of the rock and
[52:00] consume the flesh and the cakes and then
[52:02] the angel of the Lord departed out of
[52:03] his side. Now God told Gideon what to
[52:07] do. God told him you're going to go
[52:09] you're going to defeat the Midionites.
[52:10] You're going to overcome. Gave him all
[52:12] of these things. But now look here in
[52:15] Gideon or in Judges chapter 6 and 36.
[52:19] And I see something that's so uh typical
[52:21] of human nature. says in Judges 6:36,
[52:24] "And Gideon said unto God, if thou wilt
[52:27] save Israel by mine hand, as thou hast
[52:31] said, this is after he's got a bunch of
[52:33] people gathered around him. He's got all
[52:35] these people gathering together for war.
[52:36] He says, "Are you going to do what you
[52:39] said you would
[52:41] do?" Now, he know he's talking to God.
[52:44] He's having a conversation with God and
[52:46] he's saying, "Are you going to do what
[52:49] you said you would do?" That's a
[52:51] self-answering question. God, are you
[52:54] going to do what you said you would do?
[52:55] Well, you're talking to God. So, the
[52:56] answer is
[52:58] yes. God does what he says. But Gideon
[53:02] says, "If you will do what you said you
[53:04] will do," verse 37, "Behold, I will put
[53:07] a fleece of wool on the floor. And if
[53:09] the dew be on the fleece only, and it be
[53:10] dry upon all the earth, besides, then
[53:13] shall I know."
[53:15] Oh, if you know, I know you said it, but
[53:18] if you let the wool be wet, then I'll
[53:21] believe.
[53:23] Why? Why would he have to do that? What
[53:26] an insult back to God. I know you said
[53:29] it, but I want to see a piece of cloth
[53:31] get wet. Then I shall know that thou
[53:34] shalt save Israel by mine hand, as thou
[53:36] hast said. What an insult back to God.
[53:41] And you know what? God did it.
[53:45] Why grace? The grace of God vindicated
[53:49] his word back to his servant again so
[53:52] that he would encourage his faith to
[53:55] believe. And you know what happened? He
[53:58] said, "Uh, Lord, can you do it
[54:01] again?" If you were talking to me, you
[54:03] know, if if I was talking to to to
[54:06] Josiah back there and I said, "Joseiah,
[54:08] I've got my schedule. I got my tickets.
[54:10] I'm going to be flying up to to Virginia
[54:11] here and I'm going to be coming on the
[54:13] first of the month and I'm going to be
[54:14] headed up there. He's like, "All right,
[54:15] good. Good. We'll plan on having you
[54:17] there." So then a little bit later, you
[54:18] know, a few days go by, he calls me up.
[54:20] Hey, uh, are you coming like you said
[54:22] you were going to come? Like, yeah, I'm
[54:24] coming. Okay, just checking. Hang up
[54:26] again. You know, a couple days go by and
[54:29] he he calls me up. Hey, uh, remember you
[54:30] said you were coming, then you said you
[54:31] were going to come. Um, could you send
[54:34] me a plane ticket to prove it?
[54:39] I would be getting very annoyed. I be
[54:42] like,
[54:45] "Um, okay, sure. Here you go." You know,
[54:49] and then the day comes that I'm I'm
[54:50] driving to the airport and I get to the
[54:52] airport and I'm I'm fixing to board my
[54:53] plane. He's like calls, "Hey, uh, I know
[54:55] you said you're going to come. You sent
[54:56] that itinerary. You sent all that stuff,
[54:57] but could you maybe send a picture that
[54:59] you're getting on the plane or something
[55:00] so I really know you're going to do it
[55:02] and you're not
[55:03] lying?" I wouldn't send the picture.
[55:07] I wouldn't do it. I'd be like, if you're
[55:09] not going to believe me, then like,
[55:10] what's the point of all of this?
[55:14] That's right. But God has a grace
[55:19] to confirm again and again and again his
[55:23] word. And he'll show it by proof after
[55:25] proof by proof after proof by
[55:27] vindication after vindication so that
[55:29] you have not the tiniest shadow of a
[55:31] doubt. And you know, now I would be
[55:33] frustrated. You could exhaust my grace
[55:35] very easily, but the grace of God is so
[55:37] incredible that it comes and it
[55:39] vindicates the word again and again and
[55:41] again to you so that you can believe
[55:43] what he said. And and we would look at
[55:46] Gideon, we just say, "This is
[55:47] ridiculous. How could the man think this
[55:49] way?" Can you imagine saying such a
[55:51] thing to God when he said, "With his
[55:55] stripes, you are healed." Then you say,
[55:58] "Now I know you said that, but if you're
[56:00] going to do that, then I
[56:03] want such and such to come up to me and
[56:05] say a certain thing."
[56:07] Well, isn't that true how we do it?
[56:09] Don't we to go ahead and make it like
[56:10] Gideon? We say, "God, I know you said
[56:13] this and I know you said in Hebrews the
[56:15] in Isaiah 53, with your stripes we are
[56:17] healed. But if you really mean it, then
[56:21] have such and such happen." You know,
[56:24] God don't have to do nothing. But you
[56:26] know how many times he's answered a
[56:28] prayer like that and in his kindness, in
[56:31] his grace, vindicated his word and shown
[56:34] to you a promise. A and we we know in
[56:36] the word, we know by God's promise, he
[56:38] says, "I wish above all things that thou
[56:40] mayest prosper and be in health even as
[56:41] thy soul prosperth." Praise the Lord.
[56:44] And yet after knowing the word, knowing
[56:46] what he said, we oftenimes look for
[56:49] another vindication, another proof that
[56:52] God actually meant what he said. Amen.
[56:54] Well, friends, we don't have to look for
[56:56] that. If God said it, it stands true. We
[57:00] don't have to look for that. But if God
[57:02] in his grace comes down and gives you
[57:04] another little vindication in your heart
[57:06] or in your life, you should be so
[57:08] thankful for his grace that would do
[57:10] that. We know he was wounded for our
[57:12] transgressions. He was bruised for our
[57:14] iniquities. We know that there is
[57:16] therefore now no condemnation to them
[57:18] which are in Christ Jesus. And so
[57:19] therefore, I say to you, don't stand
[57:21] there and say, "God, if you've really
[57:23] forgiven me, would you let such and such
[57:25] happen? If you've really forgiven me,
[57:27] would you let a certain thing happen?"
[57:28] You know what? He doesn't have to do it.
[57:32] His word stands true. But in his grace,
[57:35] how many times has he answered a prayer
[57:37] like that and given you a vindication
[57:40] that he really meant what he said? The
[57:43] scripture says, "The chastisement of our
[57:45] peace was laid upon him." And it says,
[57:47] "The peace of God which passes all
[57:49] understanding shall keep your hearts and
[57:51] your minds through Christ." We have
[57:52] these promises. We don't have to wonder,
[57:55] "Is he actually going to give you peace?
[57:57] Is he actually going to give you a peace
[57:59] that passes all understanding? Will he
[58:02] really do what he said he will do?" The
[58:04] answer is yes. He will do what he said
[58:07] he will do. But yet in his grace,
[58:09] somebody will come through the prayer
[58:10] line and they're wondering, "Will you
[58:12] really give me peace?" And God in his
[58:14] grace will speak into that life a word
[58:17] of peace because of his love, because of
[58:19] his kindness, because of his grace.
[58:23] Amen. You know what grace comes from?
[58:25] Love.
[58:27] Praise the Lord. Oh, we know that he
[58:30] said, "The works that I do shall ye do
[58:32] also." He We know that he said, "If you
[58:34] ask the father anything in my name, I it
[58:37] shall be given to you." We know he said,
[58:38] "If you shall speak to this mountain and
[58:41] don't doubt in your heart, it would be
[58:42] moved." We know that's the word of God.
[58:44] Yet many times we just want a little bit
[58:47] extra to encourage our faith. It should
[58:50] not have to be that way. But you know
[58:53] what? In God's grace, time and again, he
[58:56] comes down and he gives us just a little
[58:58] bit more encouragement, just a little
[59:00] bit more to bolster our faith. It's the
[59:02] grace of God that does that. Praise the
[59:06] Lord. Oh, so Gideon, he finally gets
[59:09] enough courage together that God's
[59:11] really going to do what he said that he
[59:13] would do. And and God was gracious to
[59:15] Gideon in doing that. He didn't have to
[59:17] vindicate his word to Gideon, but he
[59:18] did, not once, but twice. And then he
[59:21] tells him, "If you're still afraid, if
[59:23] you're still a little bit nervous, then
[59:25] go down and listen at the enemy camp."
[59:27] And you know what? He said, "Okay, I'll
[59:29] go do that cuz yeah, I'm actually still
[59:31] a little bit afraid that maybe it's not
[59:34] going to work out." So, he goes down
[59:36] there. He gets down right into the enemy
[59:37] camp, sneaks down there with his
[59:39] servant. He's listening in what's going
[59:41] on. And he hears one of them have a
[59:43] nightmare of a dream of a of a barley
[59:46] loaf rolling down the hill and
[59:47] destruction coming. And the other one
[59:48] gets up and by spiritual interpretation
[59:51] begins to say, "That's nothing less than
[59:53] Gideon. Gideon's coming to destroy
[59:55] everybody."
[59:56] And finally he gets enough courage up.
[59:59] He runs back and he grabs his sword and
[1:00:00] he says, "Come on you 300. We're going
[1:00:02] to go and defeat the enemy because God
[1:00:04] said so."
[1:00:06] Finally he had enough courage. That was
[1:00:08] the grace of God to do that to Gideon.
[1:00:10] And friends, if we could just recognize
[1:00:13] sometimes where the enemy's at, if we
[1:00:15] could recognize the position he's in, it
[1:00:18] would actually really encourage us
[1:00:19] because we know God promised these
[1:00:21] things. And you know who else knows it?
[1:00:23] The devil. And the devil is absolutely
[1:00:25] terrified. Put up that next quote there.
[1:00:28] He says, "That little lady sitting right
[1:00:30] here." Second one on the right back
[1:00:31] there. She's bothered with nervousness,
[1:00:32] too. Isn't that right, lady? See what I
[1:00:35] mean? This demon knows if that woman
[1:00:38] will halfway believe that Jesus Christ,
[1:00:40] the son of God, and I'm his prophet,
[1:00:42] that'll have to leave her. And that
[1:00:44] demon was calling to that one for help.
[1:00:47] For help to accumulate unbelief. But
[1:00:49] he's lost the battle. Sure he has. faith
[1:00:52] is gathering. Oh, that gathering of
[1:00:56] faith. And when that faith began to
[1:00:57] gather, the demons began to scream out
[1:01:00] because they were losing their grip.
[1:01:01] They were losing their hold on the
[1:01:03] people. Now, I'm not a prophet. I can't
[1:01:05] see into that dimension. I can't hear
[1:01:07] into that dimension. But I have a
[1:01:08] prophet who's standing there telling us
[1:01:10] the devil was screaming out because that
[1:01:12] woman was beginning to halfway believe.
[1:01:17] Oh friends, if that doesn't give you
[1:01:18] enough courage, you say, "I don't know
[1:01:19] if I've got enough faith." Well, just
[1:01:21] how about get some halfway faith and the
[1:01:23] devil will be screaming for mercy. Here
[1:01:25] again, another place he says, uh,
[1:01:27] nervousness is nothing for God to heal,
[1:01:29] lady. He says, you believe he will heal
[1:01:31] nervous condition. There's just a whole
[1:01:33] group of this people suffering with that
[1:01:35] same thing. How many out there suffering
[1:01:37] with nervous condition? Hold your hand.
[1:01:38] See what I mean? There's too many to
[1:01:40] call, but them demons are calling one to
[1:01:43] another. Black streaks running
[1:01:45] everywhere. The devil knows he's
[1:01:47] defeated. Amen. Demons crying out in
[1:01:51] terror, in fear, knowing they're
[1:01:52] defeated, knowing they're powerless,
[1:01:54] knowing they're nothing but a bluff.
[1:01:56] Hearing that preaching of the word,
[1:01:57] they're scared to death. Friends, that
[1:02:00] ought to give us the courage that Gideon
[1:02:01] had to grab his sword and say, "There
[1:02:03] might be 100,000 of them, but God said
[1:02:06] we're going to win. Let's go forth the
[1:02:08] battle."
[1:02:10] God is gracious to vindicate his word to
[1:02:13] our hearts to give us that faith to
[1:02:16] believe what he said. Amen. And you look
[1:02:19] at the story of of Jonah. Jonah could
[1:02:21] have just been there one day and said,
[1:02:23] "Lord, what was that?" Oh, yes. I'll
[1:02:26] I'll send a message to Nineveh. Write it
[1:02:28] down. All right. Repent, perish. Done.
[1:02:31] I'll send it in the mail. And you know,
[1:02:34] they can either believe it or not. King
[1:02:36] of Nineveh opens a letter. Repent or
[1:02:38] perish. It'll be destroyed. Throw it in
[1:02:40] the trash can and they all perish. God
[1:02:43] could have done that. He would have sent
[1:02:45] the warning. He would have sent the
[1:02:46] warning. They refused the warning. They
[1:02:48] received the judgment. End of story. God
[1:02:50] could have done it that way. But you
[1:02:52] know what he did instead? He came down
[1:02:54] and he got a man and he put him inside
[1:02:57] the fish which was their god. And that
[1:02:59] fish came rolling up to the dock, licked
[1:03:00] out his tongue. The prophet walked out
[1:03:02] and he says, "You repent or you perish."
[1:03:04] And the entire city repented.
[1:03:07] Why? Because it was coming by a
[1:03:10] vindication to them that God was
[1:03:12] speaking.
[1:03:14] If God would do that for a bunch of
[1:03:16] heathens in Nineveh,
[1:03:18] oh, you talk about grace. God is not
[1:03:21] willing that any should perish.
[1:03:24] Now, the devil, he tries to paint this
[1:03:26] picture that that God is is sitting on a
[1:03:28] throne of judgment and he's just
[1:03:30] watching your life and he's like, "Oh,
[1:03:32] if brother Amos could just make a
[1:03:33] mistake, I'll I'll X him off and and
[1:03:35] just waiting, just watching." That's not
[1:03:37] how God is. Amen. God's not just sitting
[1:03:39] there. Oh, hey. Oh, yep. Yep. Yep.
[1:03:42] They're getting that. They're getting
[1:03:42] that and twisted up. They missed it.
[1:03:44] They missed the inspiration. I can cross
[1:03:46] them off the list. They're missing the
[1:03:47] the inspiration of the word. God's not
[1:03:50] trying to trick you up. God's not trying
[1:03:52] to mess you up. Not just looking for a
[1:03:54] chance to cross you off the list. No.
[1:03:56] The Bible says he is sitting on a throne
[1:03:58] of grace. And he's just waiting for
[1:04:02] somebody to ask for mercy and grace.
[1:04:04] He's just waiting for somebody to ask
[1:04:06] for help. And he'll help them. And he's
[1:04:09] not going he's not looking for a a
[1:04:11] chance to cross their name off of a
[1:04:13] list. He's actually written a list. And
[1:04:15] it's the list called the Lamb's Book of
[1:04:16] Life. And he wrote that list so nobody
[1:04:19] could be taken off of it so that he knew
[1:04:21] that they were safe and secure.
[1:04:23] Hallelujah. Heavens and earth will pass
[1:04:25] away, but not one name that's on that
[1:04:28] book will ever pass away. Amen. You look
[1:04:32] at the the story of Elijah and how he
[1:04:34] comes up and he says, "Listen, it's not
[1:04:36] going to rain until I call for it." They
[1:04:38] probably just laughed at him. He walked
[1:04:40] back out. Nobody really paid him much
[1:04:43] mind. Sure. But you know what? First
[1:04:45] week came, there's no rain. Second week,
[1:04:48] third week, second month, second year,
[1:04:51] sec like they started to recognize what
[1:04:53] happened. What changed? Well, there was
[1:04:55] that man called Elijah. He said it
[1:04:57] wasn't going to rain. It hasn't rained
[1:04:59] since he said. There hasn't even been a
[1:05:00] drop of dew on the grass since he spoke
[1:05:02] it. Wow. And they began to recognize
[1:05:04] there's something about that man. And so
[1:05:06] after I think it was three and a half
[1:05:08] years of no rain, they began to say,
[1:05:11] "Hey, who was that man? Let's find that
[1:05:13] man. There's a power in his words.
[1:05:16] There's something about it." And he
[1:05:17] meets up with the king and he says, "You
[1:05:19] get the entire people of Israel together
[1:05:21] and you get all the prophets together
[1:05:22] and you meet me on Mount Carmel." And
[1:05:24] you know what the king did? He said,
[1:05:26] "We'll be there." Why? They began to
[1:05:29] recognize there was a vindicated voice
[1:05:31] in the land and he gathered them
[1:05:33] together and and they had their showdown
[1:05:35] on Mount Carmel and God vindicated his
[1:05:37] prophet by fire coming down and
[1:05:39] consuming the sacrifice. He vindicated
[1:05:42] it after it was soaking wet so that it
[1:05:43] was not no trick of man. It was in such
[1:05:45] a way that they would know it was
[1:05:47] supernatural. Amen. That is the grace of
[1:05:51] God to vindicate it so that the people
[1:05:53] would recognize and that grace that
[1:05:56] vindication turned the hearts of the
[1:05:58] people back to the faith.
[1:06:02] Now that's the same thing we see
[1:06:04] happening in this hour. God vindicating
[1:06:07] a word to turn the hearts of the people.
[1:06:09] Amen.
[1:06:12] Brother R talks about what's the
[1:06:13] attraction on the mountain. He says
[1:06:15] they're all looking over there and he
[1:06:17] says, "Not even dew will fall until I
[1:06:19] call for it." And they're like, "Oh,
[1:06:20] that's bunch of fanaticism." And they
[1:06:22] say, "What's taking the He's taking the
[1:06:23] place of God with such things as halos
[1:06:25] and shadows and all they talk about and
[1:06:27] and hear all that old fanatic standing
[1:06:29] there up on the hill bringing all these
[1:06:31] people out there." What was that
[1:06:33] attraction? It was God fixing to
[1:06:36] vindicate his prophet to be right. It
[1:06:39] was God fulfilling prophecy. God also
[1:06:41] making history, fulfilling the word.
[1:06:44] Amen. The vindicated word came to that
[1:06:48] prophet and he began to speak and it was
[1:06:50] so. And you know what? It hadn't rained
[1:06:52] for three and a half years. And and
[1:06:54] after all that, they'd seen it. They'd
[1:06:55] recognize it. He says, "Listen, it's
[1:06:57] going to rain." And he goes over and he
[1:07:00] begins to pray. He cast himself. He has
[1:07:02] pray. Tells the servant, "Go look." The
[1:07:03] servant went and looked. I don't see
[1:07:05] anything. He go look again. Go look
[1:07:07] again. Go look again. He's sitting
[1:07:09] there. He's calling out for rain. And he
[1:07:11] tells him, "Go look. there's gonna be a
[1:07:13] cloud. You keep looking. You keep
[1:07:15] looking. And then he sees a cloud just
[1:07:17] the size of a man in his hand. He jumps
[1:07:19] up and he tells Elisha or he tells Ahab,
[1:07:21] he says, "You take off. You head for
[1:07:23] that city as fast as you can go." He
[1:07:25] says, "I hear the sound of an abundance
[1:07:26] of rain. The rain's going to pour down.
[1:07:28] You better get ahead of it." And he
[1:07:30] takes off running all off of just the
[1:07:32] sign of one little cloud.
[1:07:34] You see, that cloud was the vindication
[1:07:37] that what that man had said. He says,
[1:07:39] "It won't rain until I call for it." And
[1:07:41] here is a vindication that what he said
[1:07:44] was true. And in this hour, the prophet
[1:07:46] of God had a cloud that came down on
[1:07:48] Sunset Mountain, which was the Lord
[1:07:49] himself, Jesus Christ, clothed in
[1:07:52] angel's uh wings. And he tells him,
[1:07:54] listen, what my word says is truth. And
[1:07:57] it was vindication by a cloud that the
[1:07:59] prophet's word was true.
[1:08:02] Oh, and then rising of the sun, the
[1:08:05] prophet says, "And they didn't know what
[1:08:06] that was up there, but we know, just
[1:08:08] look this away. It's our Lord up there."
[1:08:10] You see, he's the one who opened those
[1:08:12] seals. Just turn the picture from this
[1:08:14] away, the way they had it, to this away.
[1:08:16] That's the way it's supposed to be. Can
[1:08:17] you see it? He is supreme judge. That's
[1:08:20] that whitewig one. And there is no un
[1:08:22] other but him. And that is a perfect
[1:08:26] identification again, a vindication.
[1:08:29] This me that this message is the truth.
[1:08:33] This is the truth. It's true. and making
[1:08:35] him not a third person but the only
[1:08:38] person. That cloud that people don't
[1:08:41] like, that people criticize, that people
[1:08:42] mock, it is the vindication of this
[1:08:46] message. Why? Because it's Christ
[1:08:49] himself coming in a cloud declaring and
[1:08:52] it was he that gave us this word. This
[1:08:54] word was coming from Christ himself,
[1:08:57] which is vindication. It's proof. Now,
[1:08:58] God didn't have to send a cloud to to
[1:09:01] vindicate. He didn't have to send a
[1:09:03] cloud to prove he did because he
[1:09:05] promised he would. But he didn't have to
[1:09:06] do these things to to try and convince
[1:09:09] people
[1:09:10] his grace.
[1:09:12] You know, they didn't have to take the
[1:09:15] picture of it. They didn't have to take
[1:09:17] the picture in the the coliseum, Sam
[1:09:20] Houston Coliseum. They didn't have to
[1:09:21] take the picture in the Sunset Mountain.
[1:09:23] But God was so gracious to allow that
[1:09:25] picture to be taken so that we could see
[1:09:27] it. so that we could see the vindication
[1:09:30] and have just that much more courage,
[1:09:32] that much more faith to believe that
[1:09:34] what God said he would do, he would do.
[1:09:37] That's good. John the Baptist comes out
[1:09:40] and he's telling them the hour has
[1:09:42] arrived and and this is the hour that
[1:09:44] the Messiah is here and the lamb of God
[1:09:46] and all these different things and and
[1:09:48] nobody Why would they believe him? They
[1:09:50] didn't understand what was going on. And
[1:09:52] and there he was standing there saying,
[1:09:53] "Listen, it's in the scripture. There's
[1:09:56] prophecies speaking of one crying in the
[1:09:58] wilderness. Listen, there's scriptures
[1:09:59] that Malachi said he would send a
[1:10:01] messenger and he would be crying out,
[1:10:03] remember the voice in the desert crying
[1:10:05] out, prepare the way of the Lord. He
[1:10:06] says, that's who it is. And he says, do
[1:10:09] you know this fulfills prophecy?
[1:10:11] Prophecy was being fulfilled. And
[1:10:12] Abraham says here, "And about that same
[1:10:14] time, the prophet turned and said,
[1:10:16] behold, there comes the lamb of God that
[1:10:18] takes away the sin of the world." Now,
[1:10:20] what's the attraction? It changed from
[1:10:23] the prophet to his prophecy. Amen. That
[1:10:27] transition, that change that went from
[1:10:29] the prophet to his prophecy. Now, there
[1:10:31] was people that continued to follow
[1:10:32] John, but there was a certain people
[1:10:35] that recognized the cha transition from
[1:10:37] the prophet to his prophecy being
[1:10:40] manifested. And the same thing happens
[1:10:43] all over the world. There's there's
[1:10:45] those that, you know, Christ was there
[1:10:47] on the cross being crucified and they're
[1:10:49] there still they're quoting Moses.
[1:10:51] They're quoting the prophecies and
[1:10:53] there's the one dying on the cross and
[1:10:55] and and they they didn't understand how
[1:10:56] it could be that that that naked man out
[1:10:59] there beaten beyond recognition,
[1:11:00] bleeding that that was the one that was
[1:11:02] the answer to all the prophet's
[1:11:04] prophecies.
[1:11:06] They didn't understand that that was the
[1:11:08] fulfillment of every sacrifice. They
[1:11:10] failed to recognize the vindicated word
[1:11:12] in their midst. Christ was vindicated.
[1:11:15] Oh, Christ was vindicated so clearly, so
[1:11:18] perfectly according to the word. But
[1:11:20] because it didn't fit their
[1:11:23] program, they crucified and
[1:11:26] rejected the very fulfillment of
[1:11:29] prophecy.
[1:11:31] Abraham talks about he said he was the
[1:11:34] high priest. The Bible said that's the
[1:11:35] reason he prophesied not knowing what he
[1:11:37] was saying. But did he he realized the
[1:11:40] real truth of it that he was sacrificing
[1:11:42] the very god that he claimed to be the
[1:11:44] high priest of? Amen.
[1:11:48] how they didn't recognize the
[1:11:51] vindication. They didn't recognize that
[1:11:54] word that was being fulfilled. They
[1:11:56] didn't recognize their day and its
[1:11:59] message. You must recognize the
[1:12:02] manifestation of the word, the prophecy
[1:12:04] becoming reality. If you fail to
[1:12:07] recognize that, you you you've missed
[1:12:10] the whole thing. Amen.
[1:12:12] You see there? And Jesus, he he opens up
[1:12:15] that book and he opens to the scripture
[1:12:17] and he says, "The spirit of God is upon
[1:12:19] me. The spirit of the Lord has anointed
[1:12:22] me." He opened the book, found the place
[1:12:23] that was written of him. And he began to
[1:12:25] preach that acceptable year of the Lord
[1:12:27] that this is what's going on. I am the
[1:12:30] fulfillment of this word. And they
[1:12:33] didn't accept it. They didn't believe
[1:12:35] it. They they tried to stone him. Why?
[1:12:38] because they'd made the commandments of
[1:12:40] God of non effect by their traditions.
[1:12:42] They said, "No, it's going to be this
[1:12:43] way. It's got to be this way. If if this
[1:12:45] is going to happen, if I'm going to
[1:12:46] accept this, then it's going to have to
[1:12:48] come this way." No. God's going to come
[1:12:50] the way he said he would come. He'll
[1:12:53] come according to prophecy. He'll come
[1:12:54] according to his word, not your opinion.
[1:12:57] Amen.
[1:12:59] Scripture says, "The people drew nigh
[1:13:01] unto God with their lips, but their
[1:13:03] heart was far from him." Amen. See, they
[1:13:06] they honor the memory of of what God did
[1:13:10] and yet dishonor the person that's there
[1:13:13] in their midst. And that's the nature of
[1:13:16] man. He remembers what God did. He's
[1:13:18] looking forward to what God's going to
[1:13:20] do and totally ignores what God's doing
[1:13:22] right now. And and and and I say that
[1:13:26] that, you know, that's the nature of
[1:13:27] man. And I believe that we need to be
[1:13:29] careful not to stand and look back to
[1:13:32] what God did in brother Brandham's day
[1:13:34] and say, "Oh, look at the vindication.
[1:13:36] Look what God did. Look at all these
[1:13:37] things." And fail to recognize the
[1:13:40] reality of that message right now
[1:13:42] amongst our lives.
[1:13:45] You see how we say, "Oh, but we're
[1:13:47] honoring the prophet and that's good.
[1:13:49] That's wonderful. But how much more of
[1:13:51] an honor would it be just to actually
[1:13:52] believe what he said?"
[1:13:56] Amen.
[1:13:58] If we were to go to the to the grave in
[1:14:00] in Jerusalem and stand there at the
[1:14:02] grave and and honor where Jesus was and
[1:14:05] go to the Sea of Galilee and honor where
[1:14:07] he was and and go to Nazareth and say
[1:14:09] this is where he was. That's good. I'd
[1:14:11] love to do that. Never had the chance.
[1:14:13] But we could go there and we could say
[1:14:14] this is where he was. And that's nice.
[1:14:16] Yeah. And yet, how many of the millions
[1:14:19] of people that go to honor where he was
[1:14:22] fail to recognize where he is? Amen. Oh,
[1:14:26] how much more of is it, you know, to to
[1:14:28] recognize where he is, to know that that
[1:14:31] beyond that that grave is empty by
[1:14:33] infallible proofs of the resurrection to
[1:14:35] say he's here, not somewhere else, not
[1:14:37] back in history, but he's the God of
[1:14:39] right now. He's the God of reality. You
[1:14:42] say, "Well, where is Christ?" Well,
[1:14:44] Brother Ram says in the token message
[1:14:46] there, uh, he said, uh, we're not to
[1:14:49] come together to talk about the message.
[1:14:50] We're to come together to get in the
[1:14:52] message. And the message is Christ. He
[1:14:55] is the word. That's right. And we're to
[1:14:57] get into it. Get beneath it. So where is
[1:15:00] Christ? Well, you say, "Well, he was in
[1:15:02] Galilee. Yes, he was in Nazareth. Yes,
[1:15:05] he was in Isaiah the prophet. Yes, he
[1:15:07] was in Bethlehem. Yes, he was in John
[1:15:09] the Baptist. Yes. But where is he right
[1:15:11] now? He is in the word for this hour.
[1:15:14] The message is Christ." And when you get
[1:15:17] this message inside of you, then you
[1:15:19] become deity incarnate.
[1:15:22] You say, "Whoa, whoa, wait, wait. You
[1:15:24] know, I thought you were talking like if
[1:15:25] I'm going to become a Christian, if I'm
[1:15:27] going to be Well, how can you serve God
[1:15:29] outside of the word that's revealed in
[1:15:31] your hour?" You say, "Oh, I'm going to
[1:15:33] be a Christian and I'm going to be like
[1:15:34] Martin Luther won't work. Christ is not
[1:15:37] there right now."
[1:15:39] You got to come under that bloody
[1:15:41] bleeding word of the message of your
[1:15:43] hour and serve God according to the word
[1:15:46] for your day. Amen. That's good. hearing
[1:15:50] token message or know trying to do God's
[1:15:52] service without being his will. He says,
[1:15:54] "And before they went into this land,
[1:15:56] before they entered, Moses said, "Now
[1:15:58] the words that I have spoken to you, I
[1:15:59] call heaven and earth to witness against
[1:16:01] you. If you add one thing to it or take
[1:16:03] one word from it, you'll not stay in the
[1:16:05] land where the Lord God gives you. So
[1:16:08] say I, in the name of Jesus Christ,
[1:16:10] don't you add one thing, don't take put
[1:16:12] your own ideas to it. You just say what
[1:16:15] is said on those tapes. You just do
[1:16:17] exactly what the Lord God has commanded
[1:16:19] you to do. Don't add to it. That's
[1:16:22] right. Now, I want you to notice the
[1:16:24] pattern. You say what is on those tapes.
[1:16:26] And then he says, you do exactly what
[1:16:28] the Lord told you to do.
[1:16:31] Say and then do. Now, a lot of people
[1:16:33] just want to apply that to preachers,
[1:16:34] that quote. And and you know, it's a
[1:16:35] good quote for preachers. But did you
[1:16:37] know every mother is a preacher?
[1:16:41] You say, "Oh, well that's for
[1:16:42] preachers." Yes, but it's for you. When
[1:16:45] you're at work, when you're out rubbing
[1:16:47] shoulders with the world, your life is
[1:16:49] preaching a message. Your life is
[1:16:51] preaching a sermon that the people are
[1:16:53] watching. You are a living epistle
[1:16:55] that's being read of all men. And I say
[1:16:57] you should never preach anything but
[1:16:59] what that prophet has said. You should
[1:17:01] not say, "Well, you know, I know the
[1:17:02] message is it says this, but here's how
[1:17:04] I'm going to live." Now, you're
[1:17:05] preaching something that he didn't
[1:17:06] preach. You say, "Well, I know the
[1:17:08] prophet said this, but I'm going to do
[1:17:10] No, he said you say and you do. Don't
[1:17:14] change it. Don't rearrange it." And and
[1:17:16] don't just put that off to somebody
[1:17:17] else. Your life, your testimony needs to
[1:17:20] be preaching what the prophet preached.
[1:17:23] Needs to be saying what the prophet
[1:17:24] said. A and by and by that I don't just
[1:17:27] mean like when you're having a
[1:17:28] conversation around the kitchen dinner
[1:17:30] table or something and talking about the
[1:17:32] message. No, no, that's not what I'm
[1:17:33] talking about. I'm talking about your
[1:17:35] life. I'm talking about when you come up
[1:17:36] against something, when your when your
[1:17:38] children are struggling with the world
[1:17:40] and and you've got lost loved ones and
[1:17:42] you've got these problems, what are your
[1:17:45] confession? What are you going to say?
[1:17:47] The scripture says in Isaiah 65, they
[1:17:49] shall build houses, speaking of the
[1:17:51] millennium, they shall build houses and
[1:17:52] inhabit them, and they shall plant
[1:17:54] vineyards and eat the fruit of them.
[1:17:56] Who's that talking about? Well, in the
[1:17:59] millennium, they're going to do these
[1:18:00] things. Well, who's going to be in the
[1:18:02] millennium? Well, the bride of Jesus
[1:18:04] Christ is. So, I can look at Isaiah
[1:18:07] 65:21 and say, "That's me. That's my
[1:18:11] promise. That's my reality. I'm going to
[1:18:14] build houses and inhabit them. And I'm
[1:18:15] going to plant vineyards and eat the
[1:18:16] fruit of them. They shall not build in
[1:18:18] another inhabit. They shall not plant in
[1:18:20] another eat. For as the days of a tree
[1:18:22] are the days of my people, and mine
[1:18:24] elect shall long enjoy the work of their
[1:18:26] hands." Who is this that's going to
[1:18:27] enjoy the work of their hands? Well,
[1:18:29] that's me. That millennium is for me.
[1:18:32] Isaiah 65:23, "They shall not labor in
[1:18:34] vain, nor bring forth for trouble, for
[1:18:36] they are the seed of the blessed of the
[1:18:38] Lord and their offspring with them."
[1:18:43] Amen.
[1:18:44] Millennium, the bride, me and my
[1:18:48] children there, too.
[1:18:50] That is directly a promise from the word
[1:18:52] of God, and I believe it with all my
[1:18:55] heart. The prophet of God says, he says
[1:18:57] about that scripture verse, he says,
[1:18:59] "The Lord will save your children." He
[1:19:01] says, "If you've got," he says, uh,
[1:19:03] "Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and
[1:19:05] thou and thy household shall be saved.
[1:19:07] If you've got faith enough for your own
[1:19:09] self to be saved, have faith enough, no
[1:19:11] matter how weward that boy or that girl
[1:19:13] is, they'll be saved anyhow." And then
[1:19:16] he goes on to say that they they'll be
[1:19:18] in that land and their offspring shall
[1:19:20] be with them. Do you believe that? Is
[1:19:22] that what a prophet said? Yes, it is.
[1:19:25] Then don't you ever confess anything
[1:19:27] else, but that my children are going to
[1:19:28] be there with me. Amen. What does the
[1:19:31] message say about you? Does it say
[1:19:33] you're a miserable failure? Or does it
[1:19:35] say you are the pure, virtuous, sinless
[1:19:37] bride of the son of the living God? What
[1:19:39] does the message say about your life?
[1:19:42] What does it say about your situation?
[1:19:44] And don't you ever confess anything
[1:19:46] else. Don't you ever confess that I'm
[1:19:47] worthless, that I'm no good? That I'm a
[1:19:49] failure. You confess what the word says.
[1:19:52] You speak what this says over your life.
[1:19:54] Don't you ever say anything else. You
[1:19:56] are the pure, virtuous, sinless bride of
[1:19:58] the son of the living God. He by his
[1:20:01] grace and his love has looked at you and
[1:20:03] said, "She is virtuous. She is pure. She
[1:20:07] has come under that blood sacrifice.
[1:20:09] She's standing under that word." And I
[1:20:11] look at her and I say, "She's justified.
[1:20:13] She never did it in the first place."
[1:20:15] That's the grace of God. That's the
[1:20:17] message of the hour. Don't you ever
[1:20:19] speak anything contrary to that. I
[1:20:21] believe that same power that spoke the
[1:20:24] world into existence is in those people
[1:20:26] that's got the Holy Ghost. That's right.
[1:20:28] Men and women, it's time we found out
[1:20:29] who we are. The devil's trying to hold
[1:20:31] you back and tell you you're some little
[1:20:33] cow down something. You're not. You're
[1:20:35] sons and daughters of God. The deity is
[1:20:39] not in heaven. It is in you. Amen. Amen.
[1:20:44] Now, what are you gonna say to that? You
[1:20:46] gonna say, "But Lord, if it really is,
[1:20:48] I've got a fleece." If it Well, You
[1:20:51] know, if you really need it, God might
[1:20:52] be that gracious to you. But friends, if
[1:20:55] this message said that the deity isn't
[1:20:57] in heaven, it's in you. Then you need to
[1:20:58] wake up in the morning looking in the
[1:21:00] mirror and say, "Deity is tabernacled
[1:21:02] inside that clay. I might not see it. I
[1:21:04] might not recognize it, but the word of
[1:21:06] God declares it." And that's what I'm
[1:21:08] going to speak. I don't care how sickly
[1:21:10] I feel. I don't care how miserable or
[1:21:12] downtrodden I'm feeling right now. Deity
[1:21:14] is dwelling within me. It's not up in
[1:21:16] heaven. For all that was in God, he
[1:21:18] poured into Christ. All that was in
[1:21:19] Christ, he poured into the church and
[1:21:22] I'm a part of that body.
[1:21:25] Oh, he said in his word that she is
[1:21:27] flesh of his flesh, bone of his bone,
[1:21:29] life of his life, spirit of his spirit,
[1:21:31] power of his power. That's what the
[1:21:33] message speaks of you. That's the
[1:21:35] description it gives of you. So, what
[1:21:37] are you going to call yourself? Well,
[1:21:40] you're going to say what he said. Are
[1:21:42] you going to say, well, you know, I'm
[1:21:43] I'm such a terrible person. I'm a
[1:21:45] failure. I'm all these things. When he
[1:21:47] says, "I'm not going to call you a
[1:21:48] church anymore. I'm going to call you
[1:21:50] bride." Are you going to make that
[1:21:52] confession? I ask you, "What's your
[1:21:54] name? What's your identification?" You
[1:21:56] can say with a confidence by a message
[1:21:58] of the hour that you have received, I'm
[1:22:00] bride. That message was sent to me. That
[1:22:03] was my word. That was the message of the
[1:22:05] hour for me. And that's what I'm
[1:22:07] identified under. Amen. Oh, John. He
[1:22:10] told him to take the little book and eat
[1:22:12] it up. Well, who's going to do that?
[1:22:14] Well, that's me. Amen. I'm going to
[1:22:16] receive the word for this hour. I'm
[1:22:17] going to eat it up. I'm going to become
[1:22:19] one with this message. Who is it that's
[1:22:21] going to fulfill these pro these
[1:22:23] promises speaking of this last day
[1:22:25] bride? Well, I look at that and I say,
[1:22:27] "That's for me because I've received
[1:22:28] this last day message." He said he
[1:22:30] promised us a full square meal of the
[1:22:32] full seven course menu of all seven for
[1:22:35] all seven seals are opened and
[1:22:37] everything's ready for the word of God
[1:22:39] to those who can receive. When I see
[1:22:41] that, I don't just say to those who can
[1:22:43] receive. I say to me because I've
[1:22:45] received it. There's a full seven course
[1:22:47] menu of the word of God that has
[1:22:49] vitamins in it that'll transform this
[1:22:51] mortal body and take me into a body
[1:22:53] change. There is a full seven course
[1:22:55] meal and it's got things inside of it
[1:22:57] that will take care of lukewarm
[1:22:59] leodysian backsliden conditions. It'll
[1:23:02] take care of sickness in your body.
[1:23:04] It'll take care of everything that you
[1:23:06] have because it's Christ. It's Christ
[1:23:08] the word being expressed in this hour.
[1:23:11] That's right.
[1:23:13] He said
[1:23:16] recognizing your day in its message, he
[1:23:17] was seeing that preview of the bride.
[1:23:19] And as he watched it, he looked out and
[1:23:22] he seen the fallenness. He seen the
[1:23:23] destruction. He seen the the sin running
[1:23:26] rampant through the churches. And he was
[1:23:28] so discouraged. He says, "And then I
[1:23:31] heard something say, the bride will come
[1:23:33] into preview again." And hear the bride
[1:23:36] come behind her, the very same looking
[1:23:38] bride that passed at the beginning. Then
[1:23:40] my heart jumped for joy to know that
[1:23:43] there will be a bride. I don't care how
[1:23:46] dark it looks. I don't care how much sin
[1:23:48] is running through the churches. I don't
[1:23:50] care what I see. I have a prophet who
[1:23:53] told me there will be a bride. He's seen
[1:23:56] the vision. He's seen her. And there's
[1:23:58] nothing that can stop a vision from
[1:23:59] coming to pass. And I know by prophecy
[1:24:02] there will be a bride. Therefore, I
[1:24:04] don't confess my feelings. I don't
[1:24:05] confess what I would see with my natural
[1:24:07] eye. I confess the word of God. There
[1:24:10] will be a bride and she won't just be
[1:24:12] coming by the skin of her teeth. She
[1:24:14] will be an invincible army. She will be
[1:24:16] pure and spotless. A glorious church for
[1:24:18] my Lord Jesus Christ and I'm a part of
[1:24:22] it.
[1:24:24] Oh, what do you say when you feel
[1:24:26] sickness in your body? What do you say
[1:24:28] when you feel all of these things? Do
[1:24:30] you say, "Well, Lord, you know, I'd
[1:24:32] believe your word if such and such."
[1:24:34] Well, friends, we have received a
[1:24:36] message that's been thoroughly
[1:24:37] vindicated. We have so many vindications
[1:24:40] of this word. We have uh hh uh how many
[1:24:42] times do we look at when uh the the the
[1:24:45] sign of the Messiah, the discerning of
[1:24:47] the hearts. Not one time like he did to
[1:24:49] Nathaniel and told him your name is
[1:24:50] Nathaniel and and Philip called you
[1:24:52] under the tree. Not just one time, but
[1:24:54] hundreds upon hundreds of times. We have
[1:24:56] recorded on tape the vindication of God
[1:24:59] through the sign of the Messiah showing
[1:25:02] that this message is true. Amen. So what
[1:25:05] more do you need to believe what a
[1:25:06] prophet said?
[1:25:08] And a prophet said, "Jesus died to heal
[1:25:11] us." Every one of you is healed. Every
[1:25:13] one of you is healed right now.
[1:25:18] Jesus has healed you. You just have to
[1:25:20] confess it and believe it. That's right.
[1:25:22] By his stripes, you were past tense
[1:25:24] healed. That's what he did at Calvary.
[1:25:28] Amen.
[1:25:30] So, what about it? Are you sick or are
[1:25:33] you healed? by the word of God, you are
[1:25:37] healed. And don't you ever confess
[1:25:40] anything contrary to that. I don't care
[1:25:42] how miserable you might be feeling in
[1:25:44] your body. And you can, somebody could
[1:25:45] ask you, "Hey, how you feeling?" Well,
[1:25:47] you know, I might not feel good, but he
[1:25:50] said, "I'm healed." And that's a reality
[1:25:53] that's beyond any reality of my personal
[1:25:55] experience.
[1:25:57] Amen. You know, I last year at at the
[1:26:00] tent meetings you guys put together
[1:26:01] here, I got to step into a confession
[1:26:04] I'd been confessing for months that God
[1:26:06] had healed me of migraines. But as I
[1:26:08] walked into that meeting that night,
[1:26:10] came up to that prayer line just to help
[1:26:12] out, not to be prayed for, God
[1:26:14] completely healed me of those migraine
[1:26:16] headaches. And it was something that I
[1:26:18] walked into confessing the word. I was
[1:26:20] in the service that night with a
[1:26:22] pounding migraine, but believing God's
[1:26:24] word said, "By my stripes, you're
[1:26:26] healed." And I knew I felt miserable. I
[1:26:28] recognized I felt miserable. And I I I
[1:26:31] wasn't saying I didn't feel like that.
[1:26:33] Sure, I felt like that. But I said,
[1:26:34] "There's a reality that's greater than
[1:26:37] my feelings. There's a reality that's
[1:26:39] greater than my circumstances." And
[1:26:40] that's a promise of God that said, "By
[1:26:42] my stripes, you are healed." It might
[1:26:46] not have been easy, but that reality
[1:26:48] became personal to me. Amen. And I'm
[1:26:51] enjoying that reality. Amen. Praise the
[1:26:54] Lord. Prophet of God says in the
[1:26:55] countdown message, what are they doing?
[1:26:58] They are wrapped in Christ in rapturing
[1:27:01] works. No, no rapturing
[1:27:05] grace. Nothing they did themselves.
[1:27:08] You'll never put yourself in a rapture.
[1:27:11] But when you can have a faith in the
[1:27:12] grace of God, when you can believe that
[1:27:14] he actually chose you, rapturing grace,
[1:27:17] nothing they did in themselves. Christ
[1:27:19] took the uneducated, the foolish things
[1:27:21] of the world, wrapped his astronauts in
[1:27:23] it, and empowered them with the Holy
[1:27:26] Ghost to take off. So friends, I have
[1:27:29] received that message. I have received
[1:27:32] that word. I am wrapped in
[1:27:38] astronomy by a vindicated message, by a
[1:27:41] vindicated prophet, and I believe it.
[1:27:44] Amen. So I don't care what's going on in
[1:27:47] the world. I don't care how much chaos
[1:27:49] and destruction and confusion. I don't
[1:27:51] care how many things are pointing at the
[1:27:53] ends of times. I'm not worried about the
[1:27:55] end of times. I'm excited about the end
[1:27:57] of times. I'm not worried about wars and
[1:27:59] rumors of wars. I'm excited. I'm looking
[1:28:02] up cuz I know my redemption is drawing
[1:28:04] nigh. I recognize the hour I'm in. I
[1:28:07] recognize the message and it's told me
[1:28:09] that I'm empowered and that I'm wrapped
[1:28:11] in astronaut material and I'm ready to
[1:28:13] take off in that rapture because I've
[1:28:16] received that word.
[1:28:19] It's a good word. It's a good message
[1:28:21] and it's been vindicated. It's been
[1:28:23] proved beyond a shadow of a doubt time
[1:28:26] after time. Pillars of fire, pillars of
[1:28:28] cloud, we got prophecies. We got a pope
[1:28:31] over there from America. We got things
[1:28:33] we could go through for hours to
[1:28:34] vindicate that this word is the truth.
[1:28:38] Now, there's just one question like
[1:28:40] Gideon. Do you now believe? Do you
[1:28:43] believe the word? Do you believe the
[1:28:45] message? If you do, then Gideon, pick up
[1:28:47] your sword and go to battle. Gideon, if
[1:28:49] you actually believe that I said I would
[1:28:51] do what I said, then there's a time for
[1:28:53] action on your part. It's a time for you
[1:28:55] to go and possess the land that God
[1:28:58] promised you you could have. Amen. Amen.
[1:29:01] Just stand up tonight. Praise the Lord.
[1:29:03] How many here believe? I believe. Well,
[1:29:06] you know how you can believe? If you're
[1:29:09] a believer,
[1:29:10] if you're not a believer, you could
[1:29:12] never muster up no belief. But if
[1:29:14] there's something on the inside of you
[1:29:16] that God placed there from before the
[1:29:18] foundation of the world to believe the
[1:29:20] word of God, then it doesn't matter the
[1:29:23] circumstance. It doesn't matter if
[1:29:24] you're buried in the in a well's belly
[1:29:26] at the bottom of the sea. You can say,
[1:29:28] "Lord, I remember what your word said,
[1:29:31] and I'm going to look towards your holy
[1:29:32] temple." It doesn't matter the
[1:29:34] circumstance. If you're a believer, then
[1:29:36] there's something inside of you that
[1:29:38] just there's a deep call into the deep,
[1:29:40] and it won't let go. It stands and
[1:29:43] believes the word of God. Amen. And the
[1:29:46] beautiful thing is it meets the word of
[1:29:50] God meets the end time condition. The
[1:29:53] last day message meets the last day
[1:29:55] condition. And there's a lot of things
[1:29:57] going on. There's a lot of situations.
[1:29:58] There's a lot of circumstances in our
[1:30:00] life. And you know what? The word has
[1:30:03] the answer. It has the answer for our
[1:30:06] situation. And and and and it has a a a
[1:30:09] a ministry to minister to us for every
[1:30:13] circumstance, every situation. And so we
[1:30:15] can go to it when we have sickness and
[1:30:18] we can say, "Lord, what did you say?"
[1:30:21] And if you're a believer, you believe
[1:30:24] it. Amen. Oh, you might struggle. It
[1:30:27] might take you a little while. You know,
[1:30:28] Gideon was a believer. He struggled, but
[1:30:31] he was a believer. And you know what?
[1:30:34] That one little man once he finally got
[1:30:36] it, once he finally knew that God was
[1:30:39] talking to him personally, once he knew
[1:30:41] that it was Gideon, Gideon was going to
[1:30:43] go and defeat a 100,000 enemies. Gideon
[1:30:46] was the one called to do this. Once he
[1:30:48] finally caught the revelation, he was
[1:30:51] unstoppable. He was a part of that
[1:30:54] invincible army.
[1:30:57] [Music]
[1:31:00] I ask you, what else you waiting
[1:31:05] for? What are you waiting for to see the
[1:31:08] promises of God made reality in your
[1:31:10] life, in your situation, in your
[1:31:12] circumstance? God's done it. God's
[1:31:15] vindicated it. God's proved it. And I
[1:31:17] just pray tonight that the Holy Spirit
[1:31:19] would come down and with that quickening
[1:31:21] power, quicken that word in your heart
[1:31:23] and make it come into a reality. Make it
[1:31:25] come into a faith to believe that you
[1:31:28] are the one he's been talking
[1:31:31] to. What is
[1:31:33] this? Oh, wonderful. I
[1:31:37] am
[1:31:38] redeemed. Well, I'm bought
[1:31:42] with a
[1:31:44] price for
[1:31:48] Jesus. He's changed my whole life.
[1:31:53] [Music]
[1:31:56] And if
[1:31:59] anybody asks
[1:32:01] you just
[1:32:04] who I
[1:32:06] am, you can tell them that I
[1:32:12] am redeemed.
[1:32:19] I
[1:32:20] am
[1:32:22] redeemed. I've been bought
[1:32:25] with a
[1:32:27] price. Oh
[1:32:30] Jesus has saved my whole life.
[1:32:36] [Music]
[1:32:39] And if
[1:32:41] anybody asks
[1:32:44] you just
[1:32:46] who I
[1:32:48] am, you tell
[1:32:51] them, "I am redeemed."
[1:32:57] You all remember the story of the the
[1:32:59] man who was to be executed
[1:33:02] and he received a little notice on a
[1:33:05] scrap piece of paper that said, "Pardon
[1:33:08] Abraham
[1:33:10] Lincoln." You
[1:33:12] know, he looked at the piece of paper.
[1:33:14] He looked at the circumstance. He says,
[1:33:16] "I don't believe it." But if he could
[1:33:19] have only recognized the vindication
[1:33:21] that was on that little scrap of paper,
[1:33:24] if he could have recognized that
[1:33:25] signature of supreme authority, that it
[1:33:28] was vindicated to be true. That one
[1:33:30] little word, pardoned, had been
[1:33:32] vindicated by the highest authority in
[1:33:34] the land. He'd have been saved. But you
[1:33:38] see, if you don't recognize the
[1:33:40] vindication, you miss the blessing
[1:33:42] that's available in that message.
[1:33:47] Receive it
[1:33:48] tonight. Receive the vindication of the
[1:33:51] word of God that's been given. It It
[1:33:54] came in kind of a funny way with the
[1:33:56] Kentucky Hillbilly, but friends, it had
[1:33:58] a
[1:33:59] signature. Had a signature of supreme
[1:34:03] authority. Let's just bow our heads
[1:34:06] tonight. Lord, how thankful we are just
[1:34:10] to your kindness and your patience with
[1:34:12] us humanity, Lord.
[1:34:14] Lord, how we struggle so often to
[1:34:16] believe, Lord. We struggle to to accept
[1:34:18] it, Lord. But you've been so gracious to
[1:34:21] vindicate your word beyond a shadow of a
[1:34:24] doubt, Lord. Lord, so there would not be
[1:34:26] any question left, Lord, that we could
[1:34:28] believe and we could accept it. And
[1:34:30] Father, I pray, Lord, that as your word
[1:34:32] was sent to heal, Lord, Lord, it was
[1:34:35] sent to heal marriages. It was sent to
[1:34:37] heal circumstances and situations in
[1:34:39] people's lives that are so broken and so
[1:34:41] messed up. Lord, you sent your word to
[1:34:44] heal sickness in the body. Lord, you
[1:34:46] sent your word to meet these endtime
[1:34:48] conditions. And Father, I pray that you
[1:34:50] would just help us tonight to accept and
[1:34:53] recognize this word, Lord, for our daily
[1:34:56] life situations, Lord, for those
[1:34:58] circumstances that we're dealing with,
[1:35:00] Lord. I'm asking that that word that was
[1:35:02] sent to heal would be received tonight,
[1:35:04] Lord. And I pray, Father, that we would
[1:35:06] recognize the vindication, Lord, the
[1:35:10] proof, the evidence that you really did
[1:35:12] say these things, Lord, and it's we can
[1:35:15] base our heart. We can rest our soul
[1:35:17] upon it, Lord, for it is the truth.
[1:35:20] Lord, I ask that this congregation
[1:35:22] tonight would just be blessed by your
[1:35:24] divine presence here among us in the
[1:35:27] name of Jesus Christ. May you grant it.
[1:35:31] Amen.
[1:35:36] Oh,
[1:35:39] heaven. I am
[1:35:46] redeemed. Oh, I am
[1:35:51] redeemed. I've been bought
[1:35:54] with a price.
[1:35:57] Oh my
[1:35:59] Jesus has saved my whole
[1:36:07] life. And if
[1:36:10] anybody ask
[1:36:13] you just
[1:36:15] who I
[1:36:18] am, just tell
[1:36:20] them that I
[1:36:23] am redeemed. Sing it
[1:36:26] again. Oh yes, I am
[1:36:33] redeemed. I've been bought
[1:36:36] with the
[1:36:39] price.
[1:36:41] Jesus has changed my whole life.
[1:36:49] Oh, if
[1:36:52] anybody ask
[1:36:54] you just
[1:36:56] who I
[1:36:59] am or tell
[1:37:02] them I
[1:37:04] am
[1:37:06] redeemed. One more time now. Oh yes, I
[1:37:12] am redeemed. Are you thankful for that
[1:37:15] tonight?
[1:37:17] But
[1:37:17] with the
[1:37:20] price for
[1:37:22] Jesus, he changed my whole life.
[1:37:30] Oh, if
[1:37:33] anybody ask
[1:37:36] you just
[1:37:38] who I
[1:37:40] am, Lord, tell
[1:37:43] them that I
[1:37:46] am
[1:37:49] redeemed. Amen. Did you enjoy that
[1:37:51] message
[1:37:53] tonight? Amen. You got to recognize your
[1:37:57] position. Amen. While he was there uh
[1:38:01] talking this quote come to me, brother
[1:38:03] Brandham says, he goes, "If you are the
[1:38:06] bride, the bride is part of the
[1:38:08] husband." The only place that you'll
[1:38:11] ever recognize it is recognize what part
[1:38:14] that husband that word you are. Or you
[1:38:17] can't recognize being the bride. How
[1:38:19] many sees that? You have to recognize
[1:38:23] your position. And I believe there's a
[1:38:25] people here tonight that can say, "I
[1:38:27] have recognized my position." Amen. Are
[1:38:31] you thankful for that tonight? Amen.
[1:38:33] It's really, really good, Brother
[1:38:35] Zachary. We really appreciate that.
[1:38:37] Amen. Can we sing that song? He'll do it
[1:38:40] again for you.
[1:38:43] Amen. He'll do it
[1:38:47] again for you. He'll do it
[1:38:55] again. Oh, just take take a look at
[1:38:59] where you are now and where he's
[1:39:06] been. Hasn't he always come
[1:39:10] through for you? He's the same God as
[1:39:15] them.
[1:39:17] [Music]
[1:39:19] Oh, you may not know how. Oh, you may
[1:39:23] not know when, but he'll do it again.
[1:39:27] Sing that again
[1:39:29] now. Oh, he'll do it
[1:39:33] again for you. He'll do it again.
[1:39:42] Oh, just take a look at where you are
[1:39:47] now and where he's
[1:39:52] been. Hasn't he always come
[1:39:55] through for you? He's the same God as
[1:40:01] men.
[1:40:02] [Music]
[1:40:04] Oh, you may not know
[1:40:07] how, you may not know when, but he'll do
[1:40:11] it again.
[1:40:16] Now you may feel
[1:40:18] down, feel like God has somehow
[1:40:26] forgotten. That you are faced with
[1:40:31] circumstances that you can't get
[1:40:37] through. Oh, and right now it seems
[1:40:42] there's no way out. and you're going
[1:40:48] under. But God's proven time and time
[1:40:53] again, he'll take care of
[1:40:58] you. Oh, he'll do it
[1:41:02] again for you. He'll do it
[1:41:09] again. Oh, just take a look.
[1:41:14] at where you are now and where you've
[1:41:21] been. Hasn't he always come through for
[1:41:26] you? He's the same now as the
[1:41:31] end. Oh, you may not know how, you may
[1:41:36] not know when, but he'll do it again.
[1:41:44] Can you give the Lord a hand clap of
[1:41:47] praise?
[1:41:49] Amen. We want to keep Brother Zachary
[1:41:51] and the family in our prayers. Amen.

[1:41:56] exhausted. They've had a long trip.

[1:42:01] just bless them. Brother Zachary is
[1:42:03] actually going to be with us this Sunday
[1:42:04] as well. So, let's just keep uh that in
[1:42:07] our prayers. Amen. We want to come
