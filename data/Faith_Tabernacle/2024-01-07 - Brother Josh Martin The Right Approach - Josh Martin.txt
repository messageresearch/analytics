this age amen [Music] good [Music] you told me in your word how you are working all things for the good of those who will only believe every good and perfect gift comes straight from your hand so

and forever we know he's alive that it takes a people to say yes to where he can work him his way through his will through amen and I believe he's got a people on the Earth that'll do that amen and uh certainly good to be in the house of the Lord trust that you're glad to be here and uh uh believe it or not I was glad that this didn't snow I U you know we got our meeting starting tomorrow night and uh so uh uh we're really looking forward to uh what God has in store and uh believing God to do great things and after our meeting then it can snow snow snow amen but uh uh but we're today we're um uh we're here and uh so we want the Lord just to have his way this morning and uh brother Josh had uh uh text me the other day saiding they're going to be here for the meeting and so they they actually come in Thursday uh afternoon I guess and so I said well I'm going to put you to work and uh so he's going to be ministering and so we're looking forward to What the Lord Has store and um as it's been said we want to keep brother Bob in our prayer and um also uh Steve uh Brumfield keep him in our prayer he had uh you can actually be seated for just a moment but he had um uh gone to the doctor the other day and uh doctor said he's 80% healed uh the the foot is 80% but gave him another month that he can't walk on it and uh the doctor was hoping it would be uh 100% healed by now and uh so it's been a a a a long process for him uh so uh that we want to just keep him in our prayer that the Lord will just uh touch him and um not just physically but spiritually as well and um I know the Lord uh will do that I believe the lord loves him and and uh has a lot for him and certainly good to uh uh have sister Hannah back amen and she's doing well and uh recovering and uh you know just had a a real bout of uh sickness of uh one way or another uh covid once and then something else and uh so she's had a rough time at it and and different ones sister Martha doing good and uh so uh we just thank thank the Lord for Watching Over Us amen and he's certainly good to do that ain't that right and um you know I um communicating with a pastor from another country yesterday and and I don't want to tell where he's at I don't know if it'd be okay to do that but uh uh uh but anyway he uh listens into our services here but um but he had ask for for us to pray for him and and his congregation and and so we want to we want to do that uh you know God's got a bride around the world uh and that believes this message and I you know just told him I saluted him for just standing true to the to the message of the hour and uh people need it no matter what language no matter what country and and uh we we still have our liberties to to Proclaim CL the gospel and uh without fear and uh but other countries don't have that privilege and U that we uh certainly uh want to keep him in our prayer and his church but uh before I called brother Josh uh out I I this quote was sent on a chat uh I think this morning and I I I thought it uh just I enjoyed it I thought I'd read it to you today but he said uh brother Brown said the reason re that you was saved so easier sometimes than you are healed he said is because you was elected before the foundation of the world and your name was put in the Lamb's Book of Life and that strain as a son and daughter of God still holds on you amen aren't you glad for that amen and and and so I I thought that was pretty just thank God for a prophet to to let us know these things and uh you may be struggling in your health but I'm so glad that we're not struggling in our soul amen that God drawed us to him and we're so thankful for that amen let's just stand to our feet and there's a song it's an old song I guess was y'all able to get it on the screen and um I thought maybe just a sing it had it on my mind um I don't know trif maybe the holy he of Heaven call me to manions Bright across the sea where loved ones way and crowns are given the heels of home keep calling me I'll take my flight like a might how many Eagles do we have when the hills of home home start calling me I'll take my flight like a mighty eagle when the hills of Home can we go down a [Music] key this house of flesh is but what a prison bars of Bones they hold my soul but the doors of [Applause] clay are going to burst wide open when the Angels sets my spirit free then I'll take my flight like a mighty eagle when the hills of Home start calling me one more time and I'll take my flight like a mighty E when the hills of Hope start calling me can you lift your hands and just Worship the Lord hallelujah it won't be too much longer Church hallelujah hallelujah it won't be long till we'll be leave here it won't be [Music] [Applause] long won't be long [Music] long has weeks the weeks has days we'll be going home can we sing that again now count the years amen count the mons as we oh count the weeks as days any Daye now we'll be going home amen you looking forward to that day when all the trials are over with all the heartaches we'll step on the other side what a day that will be amen amen if you have your Bibles I got two portions of scripture Isaiah 53 And1 and Matthew 11 and 25 like to say it's an honor to be here this morning um I wasn't planning on preaching or wanting to preach I was hoping to hear Uncle Sean but here we are I pray something can be said to be a blessing amen do you love the Lord this morning morning amen Isaiah 53 And1 who hath believed our report and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed and Matthew 11:25 Jesus would say at that time Jesus answered and said I thank thee oh Father Lord of Heaven and Earth because thou has hid these things from the wise and prudent and has revealed them unto babes even so father for so it seem good in thy sight amen you're thankful for that can we bow our heads this morning dear gracious Heavenly Father Lord what an honor and a privilege it is to come Lord before your throne and into your to your house Lord to worship your name father Lord as we've sang songs of worship father we've we've did our best Lord to create the atmosphere for you to feel welcome in Lord God we ask that you would walk the aisles this morning Lord only you can meet the needs and touch the hearts father Lord As I Lay myself aside I ask that you would speak through these lips of clay Lord God we lay their service into your hands in Jesus name amen you may be seated and if I had a a subject this morning it would be the right approach and um a lot of what I'm going to be ministering on is coming out of the the message God hiding himself in Simplicity and revealing himself the same he preached it twice once before the seals and once after the seals so those are powerful messages but brother brandham would say catch those two scriptures who hath believed our report and to whom is the army of the Lord revealed and even then Jesus thanked God that he hid the mysteries from the wise and The Prudent and would reveal them reveal it to babes such as would learn and so God hid the mysteries from one group but is going to reveal it to somebody that is willing to learn but brother Brandon would also say after he reads the Isaiah 53 And1 he would say if you believe the report then the arm of the Lord is revealed so the strength of the Lord or the power of the Lord is always operating by believing the report so by having faith in the report is going to open up the supernatural where we can see the impossibility but first we got to be willing to be taught we got to be willing to be to lay aside what we know and be willing to learn you see if somebody knows it all they're never going to be taught you know I'm an electrician and you have stages growing as you learn electricity uh you have an apprentice than a journalen than a than a contractor but you don't become a contractor right away without being first an apprentice and you can't become a gernan without being an apprentice so you start at the bottom level and you work your way up you got to be taught you got to come to a journ and say hey I don't know everything teach me the ways and as you're willing to be taught you're learning the power of electricity and I think that's the way it is with the word of God we don't know it all but we got to be willing to be taught and once we're taught by the word of God then the supernatural starts to open up or we can see the possibilities but brother Brandon would say then when we come sanely sound to God when we come without malice any Prejudice with an open heart willing to learn God's able to teach when we're willing to learn but we first must lay aside tradition lay aside ideas what we've been taught now I know mother taught you these things that was very good and so forth but sometimes mothers has things wrong and I think my sometimes parents might have things wrong the pastor sometimes might have things wrong but there's one thing that's never going to be wrong that is the word of God that is something we can anchor our life upon our belief system what we go on is the word of God you know I was listening to brother Brandon preached the message the voice of God in the last days and he goes through many voices he goes through Hollywood he goes through politics he goes through a wife he said Eve or Adam listen to the voice of Eve instead of the voice of God and he's going through those voices and then he says don't pattern your yourself after those voices listen to what the voice of God says and I thought my even though there's other opinions other influences we still got a voice that is the absolute we still got a voice that we can line our life up in every situation and every in everything we go through we still got a voice we can obey you see we're living in a day of information we have Google we have Siri we have YouTube we have everything if you want to learn something we have something that at our disposal where we can learn but Isaiah is telling us in order to see the results in order to see the supernatural you have to be taught by one thing Google's not going to teach you about it the YouTube ain't going to teach you about it but the report of the Lord will teach you the supernatural he will show you the Supernatural and Luke 1: 152 would say he put down the mighty from their seats and exalted them of low degree and I just love that scripture because I I'm not too very smart I'm not too very intelligent but this gives a promise you don't got to be smart to be exalted but if a man is trying to exalt himself he's going to be brought down by them of low degree it's not that God won't exalt smart people he won't exalt arrogant people he's looking for somebody that's humble because even dumb people can be arrogant you know they they they can be so dumb that they become arrogant but somebody that's humble enough to say Lord exalt me by your word that I can see the results I want to see the message come off the tapes and in my life I want to see the message in my church I want to see the message performing the signs in my life you see I I think too many times you know as I've grown up in the message I put things back in the past it was just for brother Brandon I remember being a teenager thinking if I got sick if I could just get in front of brother Brandon he could discern my life he he could proclaim a promise over my life but the same God the same superal natural is walking the AIS just like he did whenever he was with brother Brandon back in the 60s and 50s and 40s it's the same God today the same Supernatural if we're willing to Humble oursel to it you see Jesus would talk about the two that would go to pray one was a Pharisee and the other was a Publican and in Luke 18 and11 the Pharisees stood and prayed thus with himself God I thank thee that I'm not as other men exorts unjust adulterers even as this Publican I fast twice a week I give tithe on all that I possess and then the and the 13th verse he says and the Publican standing of far off would not lift up his head would not lift up so much as his eyes unto heaven but smoted his breath saying God be merciful to me a sinner and I tell you this this man went down to his house Justified rather than the other for everyone that exalteth himself shall be abased but he that humble himself shall be exalted so God wouldn't even hear the man's prayer that was prideful but the man that had nothing to offer the man that had nothing to give the man that had had nothing to his name but he was willing to Humble himself and then God would hear his prayer God will exalt him and I say you don't have to know everything you don't got to know all the message if you're willing to humble yourself to it and say whatever this report says I believe whatever it says concerning my family my marriage my life I'm going to humble myself to it and watch God exalt a family watch God exalt a marriage watch God exalt a church like never before you see God is wanting a body on Earth that's exalted not in smarts not in education but exalted by the supernatural oh Hallelujah brother Brandon would say you know people want power and really don't know what power is they really don't know what goes with it the way up is always down if you want Power see how humble you can get just get away from all your worldly thinking and humble yourself before God and I think this is that that's what this message come to do is humble ourself so we can see what the word really is about you remember brother brandom tells the story of John spro he was a preacher and he was overseas and he seen he was walking through a garden I believe and he seen a statue of Christ he was on the cross and he was criticizing ing the statue because it showed no suffering it showed no pain it showed no Authority and there was a guide that was behind him and he says sir I'm assuming you're criticizing the statue he says yes sir I am I see no power I see no I see no suffering and the man says you're looking at up the wrong way you got to look at up the right way and what did that guy do it leted him to humility you see that guide wasn't there to talk about what he at for breakfast or talk about what he had achieved the guide had one responsibility and that was to lead them to humility and what happens that brother brandom says he led them to an altar it says if you kneel down and look up to it you will see the power of it and John spr knelt down at the altar and looked up to that statue and he seen so much suffering that he started to cry his heart started to break what was it he looked through humility and then seen the power of it oh Hallelujah this the message ain't ain't a dead letter it has a power behind it it has a supernatural behind it if you can just humble yourself to it oh Hallelujah and watch it exalt itself or watch it exalt yourself you see brother Brandon would say it's not you exalting yourself it's God himself exalting you oh Hallelujah brother brandom talks about Jesus he says God so so Elevate him till he he become the highest of the heights he says look at Jesus nothing but one bundle of Love see he was God manifested God expressing himself through him and catch this part no wonder Miracles and things happen his humble life and consecrated life to come from being God to be a man here on Earth to express God through himself he says no wonder miracles happen no wonder these things happen cuz he humbled himself so much to express God you know brother wend my pastor said a statement the other day he says God becomes so much a human that the humans didn't recognize him as God and I thought my that's a profound statement God becomes so humble becomes so low that nobody recognized him as God why he wanted to exalt a people that can sit in Heavenly places if they could humble themselves just like he has humbled himself you see brother Brandon would say show me a church that's humble real humble not arrogancy a church just sweet a humble church I'll show you a church that has the favor and power of God in it that's right that's the thing it takes humility humbling yourself before God and letting God just work through us oh my so like I said a few minutes earlier seeing the arm of the Lord comes down to believing the report and so the the approach of it has to be the right way you know brother brandom says you can't read the Bible like a newspaper he says it won't be learned like a newspaper brother brandom says you need to get down look up saying Lord Give Me Faith to believe your word and so brother brandom he would say this here uh but and I've seen great things that the Lord has done but I always notice that it takes people that will humble themselves lay aside their own thoughts of it and just take God's thought of it and work according to his plan which is Faith in what he said and so faith and humility work hand in hand so once you get down in humility then you're able to believe what God says you see if you're smarter than the word of God you're never going to believe it if you know more than the word of God you're never going to believe it that's where many people stand with the message of the hour they have their own Revelations they have their own ideas and since they have that they can't submit themselves to it but somebody that is willing to submit themselves to it humility and faith will work hand in hand because it's only through faith that we can see the power of God brother Brandon would say we are becoming a scientific age everything must be proven scientifically we're living in the age of science as was predicted by the Bible weaker and wiser are wiser and weaker as was predicted we're living in that age we're more probed to science the further we get away from God you'll never be able to scientifically prove God and the whole Christian armor is absolutely Supernatural there's nothing natural if you can prove God there's no more need of Faith but he that cometh to God must believe it's by faith the whole Christian armor is Faith and so that's the approach I'm want to talk about is faith in the word of God but you say why was you talking about humbling yourself because humb humility brings on a faith in the word of God you see the Bible would tell us that whenever Lazarus had died and and Jesus was coming to the house Martha ran out and said Lord if you would have been here my brother surely would not have died she her spirit was in an uproar but then something changed she said but even now if you speak the word my brother would live you see her spirit was in an uproar doubt was rising up she did not want to Humble herself at the time but something took place but even now I know I might not understand the situation I might not understand why my brother had to die I might not understand what's going to happen but I know if you will speak the word if you will speak the word my brother will live and oh my that's the confidence of a humble believer I might not know what's going to happen tomorrow I might not know how I'm going to make it through this circumstance but I'm humble enough to know whatever you say is going to happen whatever the promises in your word concerning my life is is going to happen oh my and John 11:25 and Jesus said unto her I am the resurrection and the life he that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die and then he says this believest thou this he's letting her know I am the word made flesh I'm standing in front of you I am the resurrection and the life but you have to believe it you got to approach it the right way you see brother BR remember brother brandom talks about the man who told him I don't care if you can show me 10,000 Miracles I still want to believe in Divine Healing and brother brandom says sure it's not for unbelievers it's for them that believe oh my it's them that believe brother Brandon would tell us here and who has believed or report I believe his mercies are unlimited I believe tonight his mercies to you is unlimited but it's your faith that limits God and now he says see now God may come and give his great work tonight to you all he says his mercies or the Bible tells us his mercies are new Every Morning the same God that woke you up yesterday is the same God that's going to wake you up today he don't run out of mercies he don't run out of power he don't run out of authority but brother brandom says it's our faith it's our approach that limits the mercies of God oh but I say this morning morning let's take the limits off of god let's take the limits off of god let's take the breaks off of God hey we got a meeting starting tomorrow I believe we can see the supernatural we can see God Mighty in battle we can see it today God can heal today but if we're expecting something tomorrow let's take the breaks off of God and say Lord I'm coming into this meeting with the right approach saying Lord if you promise to meet me there I'm going to meet you there if you promise to heal the sick I'm going to be healed if you promised to fill with the Holy Ghost I'm going to be filled if I need Deliverance I'm going to be delivered I'm going to approach the supernatural the right way so I can see the strength of the Lord oh my I'm sure that's all of our desires is the see the strength of the Lord not just read the report but I want to see the god of the report oh my you see brother Brandon would tell us and you only get things from God that you're expecting you only get from God the things that you're EXP in from God in the way you approach God he says you approach him with reverence with faith every word is true he's saying you only get from God what you expect and you only expect in the way you approach hope this is okay this morning you can only expect God to heal if you're approaching him in faith it all goes right back to the approach you can't expect God to meet us next week if you don't got faith in us word you're not going to you can't expect to make a Rapture if you don't got faith that there is a Rapture you can't expect to be in the Millennium if you don't got faith that there is a millennium but if there's an expectation or if your approach is the right way that creates an expectation that I am going to see the promises of God in my life fulfilled oh Hallelujah cuz brother Brandon would tell us he says now usually you get what you're expecting and then you come to a meeting tonight to criticize or to make fun or to stir up the devil will give you something to criticize oh my that I'm sure all of us has read this and heard this but that just stood out to me as I read that the other day the devil will give you something to criticized it ain't God giving you a criticizing Spirit come on now if you're critical of this one critical of that one critical of this one it's not God bringing that it's the devil giving it to you come on now that means our expectation is wrong oh my you see what happens when we come to church and they sing the wrong song and so now I'm going to cross my arms it's not you're not hindering this person you're hindering yourself too many people gets in their mind where a preacher stepped on my toes so I'm going to let him know I don't approve of it you're not hindering anybody but yourself well I'm preaching now our approach has to be the right way if we get so critical we're never going to see the supernatural if you become so critical you're never going to see God in your family you're never going to see God in your marriage you're never going to see God in your life but once we approach God the right way not with the critical spirit but Lord I'm coming today a Sunday morning a Wednesday night a Sunday night with the right attitude oh brother brandom says the right mental attitude towards any promise of God will bring it to pass oh when you say my attitude don't matter it does matter I'm preaching now it does matter if you come to church not wanting to be here you're never going to see the promises of God but I say let's take the limits of God and say Lord I'm coming with an expectation to see the supernatural oh Hallelujah I'm going to see the supernatural what what do the Bible tell us the report of the Lord brings the strength of the Lord so it don't matter who's preaching it don't matter for a convention it don't matter if we at a youth camp If the message is being preached the strength of the Lord is is being preached oh my you see I I I I'll just be honest tonight or this morning I remember after a youth youth camp this past year we had a powerful move of God in the Wednesday night service I remember thinking man I wish the same the same Supernatural that was there could be in Wednesday night service honestly thinking that and I was thinking that God can only move at a youth camp God can only move at a convention God can only move if a certain a certain preacher is preaching but that's not the way it works it don't matter who's preaching it don't matter what what what church you're at if it's a convention if it's the tent meeting if it's the super if it's the the message of God being preached the Supernatural is going to follow it oh my now as I was pondering on these things we we've sort of been in a little Revival back home it was uh the Sunday before Christmas and dad had a had a burden to do a pray pray line Sunday night and Sunday morning he got up and was teaching on faith teaching on faith teaching on faith and you know if you if you was looking through critical eyes you can say man nothing's happening all that's in vain nobody's crying no nobody come up for prayer nobody done this nobody done that but then Sunday night come around Sunday night come around we had a prayer line there was people getting healed there was some getting delivered they they were weeping out the altar you may say well the supernatural moved Sunday night but the supernatural wasn't there Sunday morning come on now that's a critical eye looking at it and saying well it takes the emotion for the supernatural to be in the church but it took Sunday morning for Sunday night to happen come on now it takes this it takes the teaching for there to be a breakthrough and you know Wednesday night come along it was the Wednesday before Christmas Dad was preaching a a Christmas message and was teaching on the son of man and the same Supernatural that was their son Sunday night was there Wednesday night was there people dancing no was there people coming to the altar no was there people crying no but that didn't matter the message was being preached and that was bringing the Supernatural and oh my you may come on a Wednesday night and it may feel dry it may feel dead but if the message is coming across you can say Lord let my expectation be different let my expectation be different if the message is coming forth the report is coming forth I'm going to receive it so I can see the results oh Hallelujah I want to see the results you see it's pressure that comes against your mind comes against your faith saying if my experiencing like this one I remember as a teenager I never went out into the world I never drank I never smoked I never got into the drugs and I remember thinking as a teenager God never did anything for me I I I me literally thinking that that this one was delivered from this that one was delivered from that this one over here that one over there and God's never did anything for me and brother Tim SCH was preaching at our church I think of Wednesday night and he was preaching and he says you know many young people think that since they never went out into the world they never drank they never smoked they never did these things that God never did anything for them and I'm sitting there on the front row thinking my goodness I was just thinking this and you know what he says he says not to take away from their testimony but you have a greater testimony than the ones that are out in the world because you're in the middle of Satan's Eden and yet you're not defiled it was a voice it was pressure coming and whispering in my ear since I'm not acting like this one God ain't doing nothing for me it was the devil trying to keep me from seeing the supernatural in my life oh my I'm preaching now when it's voices of the enemy that comes and Whispers in your ear that you're not doing acting like this one you're not acting like that one and you miss the supernatural that is in your life oh we can miss the supernatural that is in the church if we're expecting oh my we can be looking everywhere else and we can miss the supernatural that is happening right in front of us I'm challenging you this morning get our approach the right way we're not approaching the pastor we're not approaching the Evangelist we're approaching God we're approaching the supernatural we're approaching the god mighty in battle oh hallelujah oh we were approaching the god that can heal oh Hallelujah and so the Bible would tell us in Hebrews 11:6 but without faith it is impossible to please him for he that cometh to God must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him so he that cometh to God or approaches God must believe so faith is more than just saying I believe God and when the doubt comes or the circumstances come I don't believe God no more but faith is an anchor faith is something that goes beyond the five senses and into the soul oh my the Bible would tell us in Matthew 15:8 this people drove up nigh unto me with their mouth and honth me with their lips but their heart is far from me so faith is more than just saying I believe and our heart is somewhere else but it's our heart saying I believe God no no matter the circumstance no matter the the situation there's an anchor on the inside the Bible would tell us in Hebrews 11 and one now Faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of Things Not Seen so faith has a reality faith has substance you might not see with your natural lie but the supernatural sense called Faith sees it before it ever takes place oh Hallelujah you see brother Brandon would say see meaning people have hope in their mental thinking and I'm sorry to say that that's the position of many Christians professing today is mental thinking they have a conception brother brandom says many people replace Faith with hope but there's no reality with hope or hope is I'm hoping that God is going to meet us today I'm hoping that God is going to be in our Revival next week I'm hoping that God will heal my body but there's no reality to Hope but faith says I know that God is going to be there tomorrow I know that God is going to be there Tuesday and once I show up with the right mental attitude I will see the results that I'm looking for oh brother brandom says you can't accept it by intellectual thought that's intellectual your mind will reason it but Faith does not reason if you got intellectual Faith then it's just a reasoning Faith oh my it's just a reasoning Faith but brother Brandon say in another place and they said it's the occupant of the Soul after all then a man does believe from his heart you think from your mind but you believe from your heart oh my your mind is never saved your body is never saved it's the Holy Ghost keeping it in the subjection but you still have other desires that you got to put into check your mind still wonders through doubt and unbelief but the heart that's been reborned oh the heart that's been sealed with the Holy Ghost there's a faith there's an anchor on the inside oh my you know another phrase from my from my pastor brother window he says the reason why I'm against psychology is because if your your psychology is in the mind you can believe God in the mind you can pray from the mind but once you're dying your your mind's dying with you once you go into the grave your mind is dead in the grave but the soul oh the soul that's been regenerated by the baptism of the Holy Ghost GH HD Ain dead it's still living there's an anchor oh Hallelujah and that's what the bride is believing from not the mind not with an intellectual conception but they're believing from the soul no matter what I go through there's an anchor no matter what tomorrow holds there's an anchor no matter what I go through this coming year there's an anchor on the inside oh Hallelujah God is sealed in and the devil is sealed out there's an anchor that is on the side of the Soul yes sir oh my and that's what we're believing from you see Faith unlocks the key to the supernatural it unlocks the supernatural so that we can see it you may stay with the Josh how does that work we can have the message opened up to us the hills can be open but if there's no faith to believe we're never going to see it hey I was raised on a message Pew I'm sure there's many in here that was too and I remember sitting there and didn't have a clue of what their what my dad was talking about I remember listening to the tapes and not having a clue made no sense but once I started to get a revelation for myself I started to get Faith for myself then it started to open up wow this is what he's talking about this is for me this ain't just a message this is my message you see it's a personal revelation you know brother brandom says that we can we can believe but once it comes to ourself we have a hard time believing it you know brother Brandon he talks about the the preacher that he was in front of his congregation and he picked up a log and he says do y'all think I can carry this log and they said yes sir you can carry it and he carried it then he got a wbel and he says do you think I can push this W barrel and they all said yes sir you can push the wheelbarrow and he started to push it and then he stopped and he says do you think I can push a person in this wheelbarrow and they all said yes sir we believe you can do it and he says okay get in and they all stop and they said well I don't know about that and he says we can say Amen to it but once it comes to us personally we have a hard time oh my that's what faith does it makes it a personal revelation it's my message this is my inheritance it's my authority this report is for me personally if there's only one person right here in Faith Tabernacle that's going to make a Rapture it's me if there's only one person in blackburg it's me if there's only one person in Virginia hits me it's Faith making it a personal revelation oh my a secondhand experience is never going to do it for you a secondhand Revelation is never going to do it for you but once it becomes your Revelation and anchors in the soul then it is your personal revindication your personal revelation you see I I've been to some new places and Sean can can vouch for it I'm sure as you travel around you come into new new churches and you don't have a clue where the office is where the bathrooms are and you you're sort of stumbling around you're looking around and you just wait for somebody to come out and say hey the office is this way and so as you approach the office you're just assuming but you're you're presuming that there's a desk in there you're presuming that there's a chair for you to sit in you know brother brandom says the word presume is the Venture without Authority and so I I have no authority to believe that there's a chair in behind that door even though there's one there but I haven't seen it yet for myself and so I'm just presuming that there's a chair there's a there's a there there's a desk back there but once the door comes open all the presuming is out the door cuz now I see it for myself oh Hallelujah and once we get a revelation of who we really are all the puming is out the door and then an actual Authority an actual Authority see the supernatural the arm of the Lord starts to manifest itself in your life oh Hallelujah this is the season for miracles this is the season for the supernatural to come in young people to come in young marriages to come in adults and manifest itself oh my it's God hiding himself in Simplicity and revealing himself the same but the brandom says he comes so humble that all the other ones rejected him they looked at him but the says whenever Christ was in the manger he says there was people from all over the place that was coming together to sacrifice and brother brandom says it was a stench in the no in the nostrils of God but then there come some Shepherds oh there come some Shepherds they wasn't smart they W wasn't intellectual but they were humble enough to follow the Angel's report and I said Lord I'm humble enough to follow the Angel's report to the supernatural you know I always thought I always had it in my mind that it was a bunch of angels that appeared to the Shepherds but if you go and read it the Bible says it was the angel of the Lord that appeared to the Shepherds and started to give them a message saying go over here and wrapping swaddling clothes here in a Manger is laying the promised Messiah and I think my we got an angel in this generation that come with the message saying the Lord is on earth now the Messiah ain't coming he's here now now the Supernatural is walking the Earth you know what brother brandham says brother brandham says the highest of Heavens come to the lowest of the Earth the Shepherds to let them know that the Messiah is on earth now oh that they didn't have to wait for something all they had to do was follow the report and they could see the promised Messiah and I say Lord we're here today looking for the supernatural if we can just follow the report we will see it oh Hallelujah hope this is okay this evening or this morning you see brother brandom says faith finds a source that other people don't know nothing about when a man has got faith in God he's got a hold of something he can't explain oh but something that he's got a hold of he can't push it shove it or pull it it takes him and that's the way faith is when a man really got faith in God it finds a source that others don't see oh it finds a source that others don't see that's why you're still here this morning that's why you haven't committed suicide or lost your mind or you're not in depression somewhere is because you found a source oh you found something that was an anchor in every circumstance you remember brother Brandon whenever he lost his wife and his daughter the man come up to him and was criticizing him and said Billy I've seen you work all day and come to the street corners and preach and then you preach all night then you go back to work and you do this over and over and over and he says now the Lord has taken your wife and your baby yeah he says why do you think of your God now he says I still think of him the same he is still worthy he and he says oh you kept your religion huh he says no My Religion kept me my religion kept me it wasn't an intellectual conception it was an anchor in the soul oh and this message has kept us through every situation this message has released an authority that we can't explain it's just a source that is carrying me this far oh Hallelujah brother Brandon would say now we found salvation we found salvation that will save us from sin that will take the viess women or man drunker or prostitute and make them a child of God he says well that same Faith the same power that will lift up a fallen man or a woman it'll work in many different ways it will heal our bodies if we can just find the right approach you got to find how to do it oh so it ain't God changing his approaches it ain't God saying okay in order for you to be saved you got to have faith but for for me to heal your body you got to do this in order for me to deliver you you got to do this but the same faith that saved our soul is the same faith that we used in every aspect of our life oh my every aspect of our life it's Faith it's Faith you see because because the five senses will always look at the negative but the but Faith looks at the positive you believe that this you believe that this morning the Bible would say in James 1:9 let the brother of low degree rejoice in that he is exalted and I think my that's what the devil is afraid of is God exalting somebody in Heavenly places where the devil can't do nothing with him brother brandom says that that a man can live so close to God that the devil don't know what to do with him that's exactly what the devil's afraid of but it's simple faith in Simplicity hope this is making sense this morning brother brandham tells a story of Mr dorsy he says he was an old man about 85 years old he was in the Civil War and he says there was a little girl that was heading to Sunday school and he says this man come up to her and says Miss where you going and she says well I'm going to Sunday school and he says why you going to Sunday school don't you know that that is an old fogy religion and she says no it ain't and he says how can you believe that and she said she stopped and she picked up a flower and he says sir where did this flower come from and brother brandom says he would say Well it come from the earth well who put the seed in the earth well well well well who who made the Earth brother brandom says it was through that Simplicity that Mr dorsy gave his life to Christ it was so simple that a little girl could believe it it was so simple that a little girl could understand God in my that's the way this message is it's so simple that even young people can understand it it's so simple that even children can understand it oh my brother Brandon will refer back to the scripture in Isaiah 3035 and8 and the highway shall there be and the way and it shall be called the way of Holiness and the unclean shall not pass over it but it shall be for those the way fearing men though fools should not air from it brother brandom says it's so simple that even fools can see it he says the unlearned can't see it but the ones with no education can't see it Oh my he talks about Moses and he says God took a simple family he says you don't even know where his mother came from you don't even know who where his father came from he says but God chose a simple family to reveal the strength and he says just to show that God works through Simplicity he allowed Moses to get exalted he went into education and but the random says he was a mighty conqueror he was conquering Nations around Egypt but God allowed him to Tumble so that he would prove that he only works through Simplicity and what happened through his education through his knowledge he got one dead Egyption but then once he humbled himself to the pillar of fire he didn't just get one dead Egyptian but Simplicity brought Li into existence Simplicity turned water into blood it was Simplicity the flip the Red Sea oh my but you notice that Moses had to approach the burning bush in humility the Bible would tell us in Exodus 3 and 4 and when the Lord saw that he turned aside to see God called unto him out of the midst of the Bush and so Moses Moses and he said here am I and he said draw not nigh hither but put off thy shoes from off thy feet for the place whereon thou standest is Holy Ground moreover he said I am the god of thy father you notice he wasn't going to reveal the message to him until he humbled himself he called him there was an attraction there was a pool he called unto Moses but before he could see the report understand it he had to Humble himself oh Hallelujah so before we the the message can call out to us there can be an attraction but before we can see it before we can understand it there has to be humility oh my you I can look you can think of the wise man and and I was listening to brother bradam and he just I love how he how he preaches that message we have seen a star and I've come to worship him he says the W the wise men were sitting around the fire and they seen a star and he says one of them looked to the other and says see what the Scrolls say about the star and as they went into the Scrolls they went to numbers and the numbers says the The Book of Numbers says out of Jacob shall arise a star and brother brandom says they left the fire they left the fire and follow the star and that D struck me they were around a man light they needed a fire to guide them but once they seen a scriptural star they didn't need that any longer they had a star leading them to the Supernatural and you notice brother brinham says that uh and he says here and they said we have seen his star in the east and have come to worship Him in other words we have seen his sign for this age that we're living in it was prophesied so they seem prophecy standing in front of them and they says this is the sign for this age I'm going to follow it and you notice what they did when they come to the city I just love they come to the city demanding where is he the king of the Jews for we have seen his star they wasn't coming in uh when saying can you please show us the king can you can you show us the king of the Jews they were coming demanding we've recognized the supernatural we've recognized his star this ain't just some star this is his star that was promised for this generation show us the king and oh my what's the Bible saying Revelations that there were seven stars in the right hand of God those stars were Messengers or Messengers those Messengers had messages and I say Lord we have seen your star in this generation we're following the star it's led us to the supernatural show us the King show us God Mighty in battle show us the supernatural show us the god that can still heal show us the god that can revive show us the god that keeps marriages together show us a God that can keep young people in the time of peer pressure if you follow the star you will find the king if you follow the star you will find the supernatural oh Hallelujah he's here walking the ows he's here walking the pews you just got to recognize the Supernatural is in your midst oh Hallelujah the Supernatural is in the midst if you're willing to follow the star Matthew 2:10 when they saw the star they rejoiced with exceedingly great joy oh could you just imagine they weren't the only stargazers there were stargazers everywhere how come they Rejoice brother Josh because there was something attracted where the carcass is there the Eagles will be gathered be gathered before the Eagles can be gathered to it there has to be an attraction to it oh the crows they don't care about it they're happy with this over here the buzzards or happy with that over there but the Eagles have an attraction and oh my they looked up and seen the star and there was an scriptural expectation and they said my she see what scripture says about this see what the Scrolls says about this there's something attracting me to this star oh there's something attracting me to this star but I'm not just happy with the attraction I want to see a scripture for it and oh my we're not just happy with the with the attraction but we want a scriptural star and I believe we got a scriptural star in this generation oh we can't help but rejoice and that's why as message Believers we have a right to be happy because out of all of the people in the world God chose you to be attracted to the super natural God chose you to produce the Life of Christ God chose you to reveal himself through oh Hallelujah God chose you to reveal himself through but the random says you're God's advertising agent he says you're his billboard he says he was driving down the road one day and he seen a billboard that said hungry just one word hungry and on the bottom of the billboard in small letters says up 5 miles up the road a certain restaurant and brother brandom said says that billboard wasn't to attract the ones that was looking for a car it wasn't to attract the ones that was looking for a hotel it was to attract the ones that were hungry oh my and that billboard was to attract the ones and say hey what's you're looking for is here oh my and that's the way our life is to be you you're needy wanting a savior you're wanting help you need help in your marriage let me show you a supernatural God let me come and see a man that has show me all the things that I have ever done come show come come see a man oh my but you notice in Matthew 2 And1 now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea the days of Herod the king behold there come wise men in the East to Jerusalem saying where is he that is born King of the Jews for we have seen a star in the east and have come to worship him but you notice how the Bible calls them wise men but if you go back to my opening scripture the Bible says it's hid from the wise and the prudent so what's the difference this one's being rejected because they're wise but these other ones are being accepted because of wisdom it's two different wisdoms here the brother Brandon would tell us and then when the wise men saw the star or saw the word of God said a star would rise out of Jacob they follow that little god-given token to the source of eternal life so will the wise men today here he's calling you wise he says who was not blinded by Creeds will follow the god-given spoken word until they see the fullness of the power of God blooming forth in this hour they see it and they know it's here in the scripture oh Hallelujah they know it's here in the scripture God promised it for today oh my so will the wise men today who is not blind by the wisdom of the world but their eyes have been opened by another wisdom you see the Bible that brother Brandon would tell us or sorry the Bible would tell us in James 3:14 but if you have bitter envying and strife in your hearts Glory not lie not against the truth this wisdom descendeth not from above but as Earthly Central devilish for where Envy is and striving is there is confusion in every evil work but the wisdom that is from above is first pure so he's letting you know there is two wisdoms what wisdom are you going to partake of oh hallelujah what wisdom are you going to partake of brother Brandman say so the wisdom that I want to get straightened out of before we start there was a wisdom of God a wisdom of God is to stay with his word but Satan in his wisdom tries to twist the word so that's the wisdom we're speaking of so anything that's contrary to the word of God is the wisdom of the world but you notice how the serpent come how Satan came to eeve and says God knows you'll be wise like him you'll be as Gods if you partake of this wisdom and but you notice they was already in a position as Gods brother brand would tell us that it Adam could speak to the storms and the storm would listen he would speak to the tree be plucked up and planted over here and it would happen he would speak with the already in a position as God brother bam called him a minor God under god Jehovah but what happened worldly wisdom pulled him from his authority oh my worldly wisdom pulled him from his authority what is that in the in the message God the voice of God on the last days he goes through voices and speaks as them as speaks to them as influences he says Hollywood is one place over there in California or wherever it's had but but he says now that influence the voice has come into all the homes and he says now it's set the pattern he says you look at Matt Dylan he says Matt Dylan he was a he was a coward he says he was a sheriff in Kansas and he would wait outside of dolge city and he would shoot me in the back he was a coward but he says now Hollywood has made him a hero he says and now all of the kitties have the H the cowboy hats they've got the six shooters and he says they can tell everything about dealing but can't say anything about Christ what it it's worldly wisdom that is bringing a generation from the wisdom of God oh Hallelujah and then he talk he continues on about Hollywood he says now they've set the pattern for the dress he says the way they do their hair and the way they dress Hollywood has set the pattern what it's worldly wisdom trying to get the bride out of her position but we don't got to be influenced by the voice of Hollywood by the voice of politics by the voice of The World God has given us a wisdom in this generation that is exalting us it's exalting us to be a Powerhouse in this generation oh Hallelujah you see brother brand would say in order to believe the devil's lie you have to ignore and deny God's truth see he says first before you can believe the devil's lie you ever think of that now you ever you ever think of that you have to deny the truth first before you can believe a lie right you have to deny it oh my you have to deny it and it's reasoning that comes in and as the Devil comes in and says well the supernatural's not going to move tonight there there's a reasoning spirit and now you're believing worldly wisdom hope this is okay tonight as we come to a church Sunday night or Wednesday night or Sunday morning and those voices whispering and so well you it's going to be no different we're going to hear the same message we're going to see the same things it's wisdom trying to pull you from the supernatural but I say let's keep our eyes upon the Heavenly wisdom oh Hallelujah let's keep our eyes on the Heavenly wisdom you see look at Genesis 2:1 17 but of the tree of knowledge of good and of evil thou shall not eat of it for on the day Thou shalt e eat us thereof Thou shalt surely die and we see today the world is getting smarter the Bible will tell us it's second Timothy 3:7 he learning and never able to come to the knowledge of truth brother brandom says they're building Rockets they're sending Rockets up but still can't explain how a blade of grass is there they said instead of trying to find how the grass is there they're building Rockets up they're getting so smart but the smarter they get the further they get away from the supernatural oh my but God has given us something in this generation that is not driving us away from him but it's pulling us to him the Bible says in Ephesians 1:8 wherein he hath abounded toward us in all wisdom and Prudence having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he has purposed in himself oh Hallelujah and so once the mystery of God was revealed the revelation of who Christ was once we seen that we seen us we seen all the wisdom and uh SEC 1 Corinthians 2 for and my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man's Wisdom but in demonstration of the spirit and of power that your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men but in the power of God that's right oh Hallelujah the seventh verse 1 Corinthians 2: 7 for we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery even the hidden wisdom which God ordained before the world unto our Glory oh oh my but it's not a hidden wisdom anymore it's revealed it's an understanding that us bride that the bride has in this generation amen you believe that let's let the musicians come this evening Lord It's a wisdom brother brandom says worldly wisdom is destroying the Earth he says all the gases all the cars everything is destroying the Earth but the Heavenly wisdom is going to restore the Earth that's right oh hallelujah oh my it's Heavenly Wis wisdom that is restoring us it was Earthly wisdom that brought us from our position but it's Heavenly wisdom that has restored us back to our positions we're minor gods in this generation we can speak the word the third poll is in action in The Bride you believe that this evening amen let's bow our heads this morning dear gracious Heavenly Father Lord thank you for this word that you've given us father Lord we might not understand it all but God we're humbling ourselves to to it and say Lord we want to see the supernatural so I'm going to humble myself I'm going to believe I'm put my faith into action Lord God as we go into this meeting this upcoming week Lord God may we lay aside all of the attitudes father Lord may we lay aside the critical spirit father Lord may we lay aside all of our ideas and agendas and come with one mindset that's I'm going to see the supernatural I'm coming with

need the Lord more today than we ever have before or real humility acknowledging him as the Bible says acknowledge in all in all thy ways acknowledge Him and He Shall direct thy paths and it's one thing that the Lord is is leading us through the prophet is to the supernatural where we can believe for all all things all things as the prophet said he said Lord You're preparing the people to believe all things and I just I just believe that if there's ever a people that is experiencing Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever it's it's the bride of Christ we're in a time where demon powers are being manifested displayed more in this age than ever before it's the darkest age most evil age but there is a people that is Conquering and they're seeing God as the mighty conqueror simply because they're not following their own paths they're not they're not leaning to their own wisdom to their own understanding but they're holy holy following the Lord amen and I thought of brother Josh as he was talking about you know not knowing where the office would be and not knowing what would be in the office per se but someone would say hey let me show you where the office is and I thought that's what God would do in this age would send us a prophet to say let me show you let let me show you all about it they where you don't have to presume anymore and he's taken all of our pursuing away and the more we follow this message the more God has made open and real to us to where we don't have to presume what he is but we know by experience and I'm so glad for that amen oh do you love him I so love him really enjoyed the the service today and thought it just a wonderful kickoff for tomorrow night and the the rest of the meeting and we want to be under great expectation don't look at your problems don't look at the the same situations don't look at anything but look to God and say God I I I want to I just want that Supernatural touch I want what you promised in your

God see how humble you can be the more humble your man can be but before the Lord the more power he can have with God can you say amen I have seen God do it many many time in our lives and just got to share a little bit with this pastor just what God has done in in our life you know as in our families growing up and with our children with uh just personal experiences uh God feeling the gas up with uh uh the truck up with gas times we didn't have food on the table pray and God would send somebody didn't even know them lived an hour away uh one time lived an hour away when Dad got through praying thanking God for supplying the needs knocked come on the door and there's this man said are you Mr Martin that says I am and he said well I don't know the whole you know what you're going through anything but says I just felt impressed to to buy groceries and I feel the Lord has led me here to this address and told me to give it to Mr Martin and just loads or sacks of groceries that happened time and time again times when we needed things times When Faith broke her ankle there in when was in Pennsylvania she her ankle snaap the bone was you know you know how it is and didn't have a car me and the boys were gone and to town we only had one car at the time and and uh didn't have a cell phone where she could call but my wife wife just laid hands on faith that ankle and begin to pray and that ankle popped back and Faith began to play around again times when Daniel uh just preaching at brother Roy got out of church and he had had his hand in our sliding door of the van and someone slammed the door shut and his hands in there and he's just crying and yelling and we open the door and you could just see it began to swell and there's black and blue and and we just began to pray and instantly quit crying the the color turned back to normal the only thing that there was was a line to show that it was done and what had happened time and time and time again it was just incredible and even just here just the other day just was in a in a situation that we needed the Lord needed the Lord in a in a worse way and didn't know how things were going to happen and just began to pray Lord I don't know what to do and God came through on the scene and met met the need that's just the god that we serve God is real he's alive and so I know that whatever you have need of God will meet the need I promise you that just believe acknowledge the Lord in all your ways amen you love him his ways are higher than our ways his thoughts are higher than our thoughts may not be able to figure God out but if we just humble ourselves and just say God you know how it is Lord just lead me just take care of it Lord we put our family we put our church we put our own lives we put our finances we put our marriage we put our children we put everything into your hands and we just rest in you and watch him take care of it amen God bless you as our prayer let's sing it once again Lord I [Music]
