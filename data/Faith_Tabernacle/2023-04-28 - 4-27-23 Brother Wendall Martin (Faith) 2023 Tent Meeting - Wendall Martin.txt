God provided a seven course meal in this day amen the church had been starving through all the ages amen but in this age he's provided the table he's provided to where we can take this book and don't have to debone it it's already been deboned God sent a prophet to restore the word to us and if you leave hunger and it's your fault can you say Amen but I believe we're like that that calf that brother Timothy was talking about we've been given the right vitamins amen and there's us Worship in our heart there's a dance in our soul and there's just something that's alive and that's burning within us amen and I can feel it here tonight amen when the people of God come together to Worship the Lord amen it's a wonderful thing amen amen you can have your seeds for just a moment amen I I want to just welcome everyone Amen to uh our our meeting and we always counted an honor to to have you a man and we make the preparation with just anticipation burning within our hearts amen for you to come and that we could draw strength from you and and that you could get strengthened as well you know we're living in a take your time we're living in a time that you know to be honest this may be the last meeting that we'll ever have a man you just never know uh things are happening rapidly around the world but there's one thing about it we uh we know where we're going and we want to take advantage here amen this week and give it all that's we we've got and so we welcome all of our visitors if this is your first time uh here uh at our meetings we pray that you just really get blessed and and get something from the Lord and I believe that we still serve a living God Amen he still delivers he still sets free he still saves Souls fills with the Holy Ghost and I'm I'm just going to preach that and I believe we've got preachers that'll preach that we heard it last night and I believe you're going to hear it more amen that God is Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever he's the same yesterday today and forever and I uh you know it's my desire and been my desire is that the message you know um that the people of God could come together and and not not to hear someone building their own kingdom not someone drawing for themselves but just to preach the message and I I believe we've got men of God here that uh this week that's going to just preach the message and we want you just to feel free to worship amen we're going to take the limits off of it all and if you want to worship God worshiping you want to run the aisle run the aisle whatever God leads you to do you do it can you say amen that's right amen I don't I don't believe this message called us to be deadheads I just don't believe that I I think we've already come out of that I think he's called us that's what God's called a message for is to call us out of of all the Dead traditions and ideologies and all of that back to the power of the Living God amen and we're not here working the people now amen I I believe this is the age you know brother Branham said that God allotted his word to every age and if you look in the age that we're living in it's time for it it's the word it's time the prophet said King lamb worship it's time for King lamb worship and you see John was the type of our day amen he saw he saw that book open the lamb had come and opened the book how many believes the book is open the Lambs opened the book in this age a man and John says after the lamb opened the book he said everything in heaven and earth under the Earth everywhere all the creature heard I John and brother Bram said he must have had a wonderful time and he said he must have saw his name in the book now brothers and sisters that's the age that we're living in that's our word and so there's nothing wrong with getting excited this ain't some Pentecostal organization getting you worked up this is a people that know they are redeemed we are a people that know we're headed to heaven brothers and sisters the tribulation is coming on but we ain't worried about that we've already got the ticket in our hand we've heard the call and it's any moment we're leaving here are you leaving well we've got something to shout about we've got something to Rejoice about amen don't don't ask me to sit down and be quiet amen when the word is coming forth that's calling my name that is me amen that's what I am I am born to be an eagle I am born to fly I was born for this age I was born for a Rapture any moment I'm going to receive a body change I'm excited Hallelujah amen well I ain't gonna preach I just want to say this you can be seated but brother Brandon said the Holy Spirit has been bound for nearly 2 000 years by these denominational Rivers that he said to be loosed in the evening time by this evening time message can you say Amen and notice what he says in another place he said how can we have a holy ghost Revival when you're so bound and starchy form of godliness the Bible said they'd have form of godliness but denied the power thereof he said the power of what the power of organization now the power of the world no the power of the church no the power of the Holy Ghost that's the secret place in the church and when the church adopts educated preachers and big buildings and finery in the state of the old-fashioned Holy Ghost they'd be better in a mission again can you say amen he said how are you going to have a Revival of the Holy Ghost and people quench it and bound it and are afraid of it he said that's where the trouble lies but you don't have to be afraid of the outpouring of the Holy Ghost can you say amen I think we're a people in this age that can discern because the word is in the bride the word is a discerner and we can discern what's bad and what's wrong that we can also discern what is true can you say Amen do you love him let's stand to our feet as we invite brother Wendell Martin to preach uh today we certainly appreciate brother Wendell and uh for coming all the way from Oklahoma and we want him just to take his time his Liberty and preach whatever the Lord lays on his heart to sing and uh uh we're just here for a good his

laborers here Lord to make this such a wonderful meeting Lord we just thank you right now for causing that rain to go away we're just believing you father to help us we're asking God that you would come in a very special way Satan there's nothing you can do to deter Sons and Daughters of God we're here with a purpose we love you Lord in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ can the Church Say Amen and a man you may be seated praise the Lord I want to speak a little bit tonight on faith then it's going to be a very simple subject man but I believe Faith's confession is very important and footsteps lead to possession can you say man when we look here at the faith of of the shooter Mike woman in action this was her promise that was given to her by God's prophet amount in this last verse that we had read she did not even think that it was possible to have this child amen the prophet had told her that all things were possible and she believed what the prophet had said and it was because she believed the words of the prophet and it was because she received the words of the prophet amen that God gave her this this a child but now the child is dead the promise is the man is about 12 years old he's got a headache he comes and lays in his mama's lap Penny man he dies right there and but the scripture says but she went up and she laid him on the bed of the man of God and she shut the door on him and she went out now I I I'll tell you right now she wasn't going out to make funeral arrangements she wasn't going out to mourn and and and to curse God she was out to find the prophet of God the one who gave the promise in the first place now can you say Amen I say tonight the church is built upon divine revelation the man told Brother Branham one time he says amen that he could not accept Revelation and brother Branham says then you cannot accept Jesus Christ for Jesus Christ is the revelation of God in flesh can you say man amen I want to deal here tonight a little bit on faith amen faith is the very Foundation that God pleases that he himself places as the foundation of the pyramid in your life can you say man amen I want to say that Victory is the direct consequence of Faith's Revelation amen now I want you to think about it Victory is the direct consequence of Faith's Revelation in your life amen Faith literally confesses or it literally expresses what it sees therefore Revelation is how you know what faith is thinking about or what faith is seeing so when we talk about divine revelation it is it is Faith expressing what it is seeing it is expressing what it knows to be a fact amen we got to have faith in our lives amen now that's not it's not it's not in it in your learning it's not in amen how many books you have it's not in how much uh amen how many You Know Places you've got your names put on the roll what matters is Faith having its foundation in your life can you say man amen so Revelation is a privilege previously hidden but now made known unto you Revelation is the taking the cover off and the revealing of what is behind the cover amen Revelation is the unmasking of God's plan for your life unmasking God's plan for the age God Amen unmasking God revealing God God turning the light on well praise the Lord [Applause] glory to God the light on so that the public can see it Hallelujah I want to say when Faith walks into the room man he turns the light on and you can see what is there and faith is right there amen with an assurance standing right there saying here is your promise here is what God has for you here is what God wants to do for you here is what God's going to bring about in your life can you say Amen now you can walk by your side if you want to you can walk by emotion if you want to but the child of God has been given a faith and this faith is to take us into another realm where all things are possible where the Supernatural is their present Hallelujah I believe this morning on this evening we need to get out of this Physical Realm and get into a room where all things are possible all we've Gotta Have is a faith to believe it can you say amen amen that's exactly right amen there's no hypocrisy to faith faith is not something that is an imagination faith is not an imaginary Faith sees the product [Applause] faith is not hope so faith is not guesswork faith is a revelation of what God sees well praise the Lord so faith takes you into the place where God lives Faith takes you into that place and Faith reveals what God sees and escorts you into that rim to where you can experience and possess it well praise the Lord so when you're walking with God by Revelation it is a literal experience with the supernatural in your life they said that brother Branham Hallelujah you mind my my voice is pretty weak so I I'm but I'm going to preach to you tonight Hallelujah they said brother Brandon if you were sitting there with the old timer said when they were set with brother Branham occasionally he would stop and just touch the salt shaker amen and so finally someone asked him one time why do you always touch the salt shaker he says because sometimes I don't know whether I'm in that room or in this room I I I I walk in that Rim so much that sometimes are y'all hearing me tonight amen you see I believe that that Prophet walked in a rim alone with God but the prophet also said that every believer walks in a world alone with God alone with God you're walking with God you're experiencing what God sees you're understanding the way God understands it faith is not a PIN to tell on the donkey experience you're not blindfolded you're not trying to make it happen you know that God's will is for you and you can stand assured on that promise then you say Amen we're gonna throw in the dark you know darks in the blind amen blindfolded but Faith illuminates what God has Faith knows where God's at Faith knows how to take you there I believe it's for Corinthians 9 and 26 says I therefore shall run not as uncertainly so fight I not as one that is beating the air I know in whom I believe I'm standing upon that promise can you say Amen so the mystery of redemption that was once hidden in the mind of God the prophet of God says those Redemption thoughts was way back in his mind Hallelujah he knew the fall was coming he knew it was going to be there he's come on now now nothing ever comes to God Amen without God knowing it no the fall was coming God knew amen the serpent was there but in the back of God's mind he had a plan [Applause] oh can you say man amen so when the hey when the when the Adam and Eve had fallen and they had fallen short of the glory of God and now they're going to die they're walking out of the garden there they are the world is turned upside down but God says I've got a plan I've got a plan I'm not going to make it known right now amen because faith is being shut up until the time comes but the time will come the time will come where they will know who they are they will see Redemption foreign now right now your mind just shut up right now you're falling right now you're you're in Gloom right now the soul has been shut up but I want to give you a little bit of a secret as the son and daughter is walking out walking out the gates God's heart was a beating and he said oh I've got to let a little bit of my secret out [Music] [Applause] Garden without giving you a promise it's not the season yet it's not the time yet your generation is going to go generation after generation after generation of death and misery and sorrow but I'm going to give you a promise that I'm going to redeem you and the Bible says that he slays a lamb and as he slays that lamb he takes The Cult and he wraps it around them well are y'all hearing me and he's saying now listen Satan got a good one on me Satan knows I don't have a body right now and in order to redeem you I'm going to have to have a body he was here when I gave the promise to Adam in the first place he was here when I gave adam Dominion and Authority and he come in and he worked his way into the serpent and now he's claiming control of the human race but I just want to give you a promise I want to give you a promise that I'm going to build myself a body someday and it'll come to the womb of a woman and I will defeat the enemy foreign can you say Amen amen his thoughts of you were from the beginning his thoughts of redemption the golden scepter had already been extended to us before the world began the scripture says you were chosen in him before the foundation of the world can you say Amen now what is revelation it is to now bring into public view it is now to manifestly declare Faith turns the light on to let you know what God has done and what he is doing in your life when you see Jesus Christ you use the Wrath [Applause] now when you see Jesus is the mystery of God revealed then you will also see that you are a part of that revelation of God [Applause] when you catch a revelation of who Jesus is then you catch a revelation of Who You Are when you catch a revelation of what he came for then you catch a revelation well praise the Lord

against her you can charm in her but she's got a divine revelation she's built with eyesight she knows who she is can you say Amen Hallelujah when you see Jesus Christ through the Faith's eye you're not seeing amount the second person of the godhead you're seeing the realities of the love of God expressing Redemption amen what praises the Lord now when Christ gave his blood he bought you can I hear an amen and he gave you a right to every Redemptive blessing second Timothy 1 and 9 it says who hath saved us someone say hallelujah and called us with an holy calling someone say thank you Jesus not according to our works someone say hallelujah but according to his own purpose and Grace which was given us in Christ Jesus before the world began [Music] but he's saying that it's now made manifest that word manifest as brought into the public view by the appearing of Our Savior Jesus Christ if you're going down to the 12th verse and it says for which calls I suffer these things nevertheless I am not ashamed for I know whom I have believed I am persuaded that he is able to keep that which I've committed unto him against that day can you say amen amen listen to me friends whatever happened on that Damascus Road some kind of a faith some kind of an understanding some kind of a light switch was turned on and the Apostle Paul amen he left the old Judaism behind and he turned around to follow after that which he had seen he was Head and Shoulders above a bow he was the highest of his religion but what he saw When Faith flipped the light on it changed his life forever [Applause] I am persuaded we get too many people setting in message pews and they've not met Christ we get too many people sitting in churches everywhere and they don't know Jesus [Applause] you say not in the message churches not message churches [Applause] well praise the Lord they say you got the Holy Ghost when you speak in tongues you say you got the Holy Ghost just because a prophet came what's the difference [Applause] [Music] but the new birth gives a faith the new birth turns the light oh come on Church what we needed here tonight is for the Holy Spirit to turn the light switch on where you can walk into the room and you can find the glory of God Hallelujah Amen in this room with God there's blessings in this room with God there's tongues in this room with God there's

of his prayers he and man he said the man he said what we need is as many of those were Spirit-filled Christians no doubt bigger number were and they're sick and they're needy oh great God Jehovah God Supply their every need and that would be faith to believe the finished work has been accomplished can you say Amen well the sister asked me to pray with her one time and um Man by the time she got through with her prey and I was quite certain that God was depressed everything was wrong with her I mean she had been done so wrong and everything was so bad and everything was so I praise the Lord by the time she got through exalting her problems I looked over at her amen I said Dear God amen I don't even know of God if God's got enough Faith over this Hallelujah I told the sister I said why don't you quit praying your problems and start praying God's word won't you stop praying your what praise the Lord can you say Amen you don't pray your problems you pray your word you say well amen

with faith believing [Music] brother Branham says according to the scriptures you said that by the stripes we were healed it isn't necessary to pray them only to confess our sins for by your stripes we were past tense healed oh what a day of salvation What A Promise by Emmanuel that is certainly the truth can you say man now hey man I hope it's all right here tonight faith is the Revelation now the Apostle Paul they're in in Hebrews the 11th chapter he says by faith Noah by faith Abel now that word amen is simply means faith is the persuasion of God by the persuasion of God Abel by the persuasion of God in Abraham by the persuasion of God it was God persuading there was no guesswork about it there was no turning around one way or the other it was God that gave the promise it was God that turned the light on it was faith that revealed God's mind and it didn't matter how long it took nor was willing to to to to go for 120 years all right and I love it when we look there at Romans 4 and 8 19. talking about Abraham and being not weak in faith he considered not his own body now dead when he was about a hundred years old neither yet the deadness of Sarah's womb he staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief but was strong in faith giving glory to God [Applause] and being fully persuaded that what he had promised he was able also to perform and therefore it was imputed to him for righteousness brother Branham would say a man ought to get on that sacred ground with God I'm preaching here tonight I believe that this is going to be a meeting why not just expect this meeting to be the meeting of all meetings why not expect this meeting to be Supernatural come on church I know that rain is out there and I know Satan would like to try to hinder but I'm here to tell you we're not going to be hindered because we are fully persuaded we are fully persuaded we are fully persuaded that what he has promised he will perform well the Brenham says a man ought to get get to first get on the sacred ground with God where all the theologians all the doctors of divinity all the reasoning all the atheists nothing else can ever explain that away from him he was there when God come he knows what took place you can't reason it out of him he was there when it happened can I hear a great big amen [Applause] now Jesus was praying and in his prayer he said father I pray that they would be one even as you and I are one I want this Revelation to so let there be such a fellowship between them and me and me and you and you and them let there be such a union such divine revelation that they would know who they are that they would know who I am that they would be able to stand and act as your agents here on this Earth I must go but I'm going to send the comforter and I'm asking you to make them one like we're one but praise the Lord now the Son and the father were not one as in one finger it was the Eternal God who emptied himself in the virgin-born son of God that way when Jesus says it is it is my meat to do the will unto me can you say Amen Jesus is saying I'm leaving I've got to go in his prayer he says I pray that there would be a Oneness and Those whom you have redeemed a one that's not not not not not don't raise up good preachers necessarily don't just raise up prophets like you did in the Old Testament Saints necessarily but I pray that you them one from the youngest to the oldest from the least to the greatest where the anointing will be upon them where the glory Glory God would rest here on the Earth oh can you say Amen Hallelujah amen praise the Lord now Jesus says I and my father are one and we become one it's no longer God of there Jesus is the revelation of God here on there it was no longer God now it was God in flesh Jesus says I'm going and but when I leave I'm going to send that same comforter that made me one with God I'm going to bring him back Upon A group of people and they will reflect [Applause] a Oneness that governments have never been able to done a Oneness that denominations have never been able to do a Oneness that no one else has ever been able to do foreign [Applause] when that Holy Spirit comes down there will be a Oneness but praise the Lord Jesus become one with God he was the revelation of God what he saw he done Jesus wasn't guessing and trying he was the revelation of the invisible God the Bride of Jesus Christ is the revelation of God in this last day [Applause] but praise the Lord all that God was reported to Christ all that Christ was all I'm trying to do is turn the light switch on here tonight all I'm trying to do is tell you guys y'all aren't just a bunch of Amen just you know Misfits here in this world turn the light on you are the sons and daughters you are the Bride of Jesus Christ live in it enjoy it reflect it that's your call [Applause] brother random says if you'll notice how that Eve was United with Adam she become part of him did you notice in Genesis 1 27 he created man both male and female created he them and the man both male and female when it comes to being in the spirit of feminist and masculine then God took from his side a rib do you notice the body part was a byproduct but not the spirit the body part of the woman was a byproduct after the creation had been finished God took from the sight of Adam a rib and made a woman but not the spirit the spirit was part of Adam for he was both man and woman spiritually speaking masculine and feminine don't you see light switch the big picture we in flesh are different we're like a byproduct a created being by holy wedlock but in spirit punch your neighbor and say this is getting good but in spirit we are sons and daughters not some other Spirit but the spirit of the Living God we are in his likeness in his unity in the perfect image of the Living God because we become Sons and Daughters not separated but the Same Spirit the same God the same person joined and headlock to the wedlock to the Eternal see how God planned it not that we should be different but to be him [Applause] let's turn the light switch on that's your chance to do a jig [Applause] in your flesh you have a mom and a daddy in your flesh some of you are ugly some of you are good looking I wasn't looking at you girls when I said that amen looking over here at these guys hey man ugly and cute this isn't something that is way beyond our reach by predestination Eve was can you see me they meant the three creations of Adam spirit body and woman the three manifestations of God Pillar of Fire Jesus Christ and now the bride can you say Amen Eve was part of Adam Adam was at was Adam and Eve he was both feminine and non-masculine can you say man God had a part of him that he wanted to have expressed he had a part of him that he was longing to get out it's been in the back of his mind for a long time come on Church Amendment all on the day of Calvary when he put him to sleep out of Christ came a pride you're no longer in the back of God's mind you're no longer a thought you're an expression you're deity you're the manifestation you're who God wanted all along turn the light on and see who you are foreign [Applause] it's God taking it from here the world still don't see it because they're not bright but the brat came from him yes for him everything about her is him [Applause] and you're sitting there wondering if God can heal a toothache you're sitting there wondering if God can save your sons and daughters you're sitting there wondering if God can fill you with the Holy Ghost I'm here to tell you Faith sees the promise it's reality the manifestation of God is here in a bride glory to God can you say man first manifestation with spirit second manifestation was Adam but out of Adam out of Christ come this lovely bride now brother Branham would say we're not separated with the same spirit same God same person see how God planted that we should be not different but him not some other being of another tribe but a real Union an offspring of the almighty done by a holy Union the body comes from father and mother but the spirit come from God God separating himself as Adam was separated did you realize that when you received the Holy Ghost the feminine side of God has settled right down upon a bride well praise the Lord the feminine side of God praise the Lord oh he poured into Christ all praise the Lord you don't want to understand that sometimes you can't understand that but I'm here to tell you it's the truth anyway [Applause] brother Adam says on the day of Pentecost we find the Holy Ghost the pillar of fire separating itself setting upon each member of that church God putting himself together then when that group of people uh when that group of people together what does it do it brings back the unified body of the Lord Jesus [Applause] amen why was it in this last day and I'm going to start to descend here in this last day a man when that when that book when the mighty angel came down and gave the book it was a faith now now remember he told Daniels seal it up he told John seal it up but when the faith comes there's going to be somebody who's going to stand up in this cloak of a message would identify herself with what God has been thinking all along and when he says go and take the little book which is open he knew that there was going to be somebody that was going to be willing to stand up and go to that angel and say give me the book [Applause] there would be a faith for someone to say yeah that's me everybody there would be a faith on Earth that would say yes I believe that yes I see that yes I'll do that yes I'm going to the angel and I'm demanding the book the book is mine I believe what has been said God said I'm his bride and I believe it go take the book yes sir give me the book [Applause] you're his bride yes sir I'm his bride by my stripes I heal yes sir by your stripes I heal I still feel with the Holy Ghost yes sir give me the Holy Ghost [Applause] When Faith Comes you accept it because you see it the way God sees it and you just act upon what you're seeing for the Sean it's not you twisting your Church's arm it's not that
