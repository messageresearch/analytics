just good weather next week so this is this is good this is good a man and uh so before we go into the word may we just bow our heads and talk to the Lord father we stand here today with Humble Hearts so thankful that you brought us through another year Lord through all the the struggles through all the things Lord that we we faced in our personal lives in the church and as a nation father and yet we're still standing strong fervent Lord than ever before determined Lord to make Heaven our home and oh God we're asking for your grace as we face this year Lord and Lord was we know that it's it's a Dark Age a dark hour that father we thank you for the light that you've shined Upon Us Lord pray Lord that you would keep your people bless them abundantly father with all the desires of their heart as your Prophet would say physically spiritually financially Lord every part of their lives we pray that you would bless them and give us Grace Lord more grace is our prayer we ask that you would just bless the ministering of your word this morning we leave this service into your hands now in Jesus Christ's name and the church says amen if you'd like to turn again Revelations the 21st chapter and um I'm going to start at the first verse but it says and I saw a new Heaven and the new Earth for the first Heaven and the first Earth were passed away and there was no more sea and I John saw the holy city New Jerusalem coming down from God out of Heaven prepared as a bride adorned for her husband and I heard a great voice out of Heaven saying behold the Tabernacle of God is with men and he will dwell with them and they shall be his people God himself shall be with them and be their God and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes there should be no more death no more neither sorrow nor crying neither shall there be any more pain for the former things that passed away and he that set upon the throne said behold I make all things new and he said unto me right for these words are true and faithful amen you can have your seats this morning it's hard to believe that we're here in the year of 2023 and never thought that we would be this far in the year 2000 there but here we are and it seems like the years are just going by so quickly the man just uh just just everything going and but here I thought of this quote brother Branham he said we we faced this year just like we do all years there is a regret of our mistakes in the past and are looking forward for a future of the Glorious Light of Christ no doubt if we live through this year we'll find many mistakes that we have made and we just expect that because it goes along with the pro and con that's the law of average that we live by here in this life but we're so glad we have a mediator who sits at the right hand of God to make intercessions aren't you glad for that he says when we are willing to admit our mistakes that we've done wrong then he forgives them he is full of grace and mercy to forgive us for those mistakes now I've just thought of this this new year and and I'm just be simple this morning but the new year to some may just be another year um you know the doing away with the old calendar and and putting up a new one and whatever and and then there's a lot of people today that's entering the New Year wandering about the future of our country wondering you know what the future holds for them and or for the world for that matter because everything is so uncertain right now and so you know there may be some that are wondering about the future of their job wondering about the future of the economy wondering about the future of retirement will there be anything left in retirement time it's all said and done and and so uh but one thing that that every year new year seems to do uh to people and that is to cause them to want change everybody wants change um and of course it's it's for the better and and I guess that's because the new year uh is is a new beginning and it's a new beginning and so everybody wants to uh foreign be identified with that beginning that's new and um you know uh as the prophet would describe it he said the old year has died and another year has been born and so we we want what we were in that past year to die with it and we want to be new and start Things New afresh in in the new year that is is here upon us with the New Year comes new expectations new hopes and dreams are born and uh because people again want to be identified uh uh with the new and uh it it you know it's it's uh uh New Year's resolutions are made uh always made during this time um vows promises to be better um you know I uh uh I I've made them type of uh things too you know mine was to lose weight you know beginning of year you know and and well why didn't you do it you know a month in December oh we'll wait New Year's coming and uh so we we are going to start off fresh new year but it's uh you know as I uh anyway you could tell that failed a lot and so uh turning over a new Leaf um uh uh a new page as the prophet would call it but people want to be different than they were last year they they they they want to have a better life they they want to be a better person people promises every year I'm going to quit lying I'm I'm going to quit stealing I'm I'm going to quit cheating on my spouse I'm I'm I'm going to be better I I'm going to quit the smoking I'm going to quit drinking I'm you know it's it's these things and and even we find ourselves I'm gonna do more for God and and and and these things and so uh it seems like many many people enter the the new year with good intentions and then you hear the prophet say but hell is paved with good intentions and and and so uh uh change change doesn't come by making a New Year's resolution uh because I'm a witness you go back to being what you were uh it it can never change you in that way uh and so this is why uh we don't we don't believe in making New Year's resolutions we we we don't believe in turning over a new Leaf or or whatever you would call it uh because they don't work uh it's it's basically uh the old person entering into another year and the year begins and the person uh uh that that we're entering uh there's nothing new that happens with them and and so they go back to the you know it's about this time of the year that the gym even gets uh full I mean packed and and so you kind of wait until about a month or two and and uh then you get your spot back you know but uh because it it just don't last it resolutions and things like that and and so uh in order for Change and and uh I guess this is this is just I'm dealing with change uh being it is the new year but in order for that to happen a man must meet God face to face uh that's just and and and and have eternal life and be filled with the spirit and and of course I'm talking of a a greater change than than just uh going on a diet or a greater change than just uh getting more money or a better job or or whatever uh because the the change that I would say most most people in the world uh has to do with the spiritual side of it uh uh and and of wanting to be changed they they want to be a better individual a better citizen a better a better husband a better wife a better child everything there and so it this this type of change is the only way that that that change can come is is by meeting God and and brother the Branham even talks about the man that just couldn't make up his mind you know uh he he wanted but he wanted to go but he just the devil just kept beating him up uh just constantly beating him out of it and and so the the prophet said that one day he just got out in the field and knelt down to pray and he said while he was praying he just drove down a he called it a stop and and said let this be a memorial Satan if you ever come to me again I'm going to point you to this stop and I'll tell you that right here I met God and he said and it was settled from there on now that's the change that's the change that we that that that a person needs is when he meets God face to face and we've got a Bible full of stories of men and women that met God face to face and they they were never the same again never the same ain't that right and so uh you're changed when you meet God and brother Brown said it's not it's not turn a new page but actually die and be born again if if a man wants change if you young people want change You Gotta Die and be born again he said you got to feel so guilty when you stand in his presence and and to be honest that's where people are lacking is they they don't feel the guilt amen they want change but they don't feel the guilt uh uh they make excuses and and these things as to why they do what they do instead of just coming into the presence of God and humbling themselves and and just filling the guilt ain't that right amen and and so he says you you got to feel so guilty when you stand in his presence whether you go to the Methodist Way Baptist way whatever way you go you've got to be so guilty and feel so guilty till it'll kill you that's right it'll kill you your worldly life will die right there you've got to reckon yourself so guilty in the presence of God until your worldly life dies right there I mean so tired of it so and and and you you you you come and and that's how you approach it when you meet God can you say man and and so uh uh uh the sin questions over for you when you're standing ending in his presence when you look like that you're sure to live see because you die and the only way you can live again is to die first so you can live again ain't that right but but you know today these days the world is looking for change as a whole the world is looking for change in in to be honest the change is Shifting we we see it we see in it more and more now the prophet talked about it how they're passing laws and all these things but today we're actually seeing the shift in the the change now you had one uh man a president uh that was America America and we found that didn't last long amen because laws and everything the regime's already set in place amen they don't want America they they want a One World Government they don't want identity the individual identity they want everything to come together and and so they they the world is is looking for change they want change in politics and it's happening they they want change in society it's happening they want change in the government it's happening and they want change in their churches and it's happening change like never before is happening but why do they want change is because they are dissatisfied amen if you were satisfied you wouldn't want change but uh uh because people are dissatisfied then they they want change they'll they'll change churches they'll change schools they'll change you know some of them even have changed citizenship they're tired of America and believe it or not they go somewhere else and live and identify as as another uh citizen of another country and and then you've got people that is flocking over into America because they don't like where they're at today or or where they're from and so they're coming and but everybody wants chains there's such an unrest of change uh uh and they're calling for it a man and and I thought of this um of why why are people so dissatisfied and and in Romans 8 and 19. Paul says the earnest expectation weighteth of the creature waited for the manifestation of the sons of God so this is giving us an answer for the creature was made subject to vanity not willingly but by reason of him who has subjected the same in Hope because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the Glorious Liberty of the children of God for we know that the whole creation grownness and travaileth in pain together until now think of that so the the the nature the Earth uh all creation is groaning you there there cannot be a man woman boy or girl uh there cannot be any type of a living thing that exists up on the earth uh uh without some type of a groaning amen because that's what the Bible says that the whole creation groans and travaleth together until now ain't that right amen they're groaning now the prophet goes more into this and says why why he says something's lost and it's groaning ain't that right it's trying to get back to be to its original condition trees want to go back to its original condition the world wants to go back to its original Crea condition the Stars the moon the the Sun at everything is groaning that Little Flower wants to go back to its its original condition you understand what I'm saying a man and man even though they don't understand why they want the change it's just something that is calling out a man to go back ain't that right and and they're putting their interest they're putting all their stuff in the wrong places they want to save America but that's not the original condition they they they want to save the Democracy let us listen to brother Branham today he said democracy has come to its end it's it's served its purpose but it wasn't the answer kingdoms have served its purpose but look where they're at today and so is it with democracy ain't that right so he says see is trying to get back to its original condition would you imagine uh someone fear falling from the earth down into a deep pit somewhere and was struggling climbing pulling they must by some means get out of this pit why they're not in their original state and frantically they're screaming they're they're clawing the walls making a noise or doing some way see they're groaning because that they want to get back to their original state as when a person is struck with disease aches and pains and one time they wasn't that way but they're groaning why they're not right see something's wrong and they're groaning and trying to get back to where they was when they had health and when Nature and people as the Bible says are groaning it shows there's something that they're not in there ought to be conditioned they've fallen from some Wares ain't that right a man sold the world and and and I'm I'm glad that the prophet would uh or that God opened our eyes to to this message that we can understand why people want change why why they're so miserable and now church WIll you know well the poor man you know the poor man looks at the rich man says oh if I could just be that but you get there and look at the rich man's life and he's just as miserable as anybody else because money can't satisfy the car uh uh can't satisfy the the thousand dollar suits can't satisfy amen the the million dollar jobs can't satisfy you understand where we're at see Fame Fortune can't satisfy because we're not in the right condition amen our rightful place and so we know what the prophet said that it was eternal life that man fell from a man and and so we lost our claims on eternal life by the fall of Adam and Eve and uh who fell the prophet said from eternal life to death in the Garden of Eden and brought all nature all nature amen not just humans but the trees the flowers the the animals it brought all nature under death with them ain't that right so uh a tree never died before Adam a flower never died before Adam a bird never never died uh uh no nothing ever died before Adam amen but but now all we see is death everything is death man's inventions death uh man's success it just only dies a man rises in Fame only to die everything about him just dies ain't that right amen but there's only one thing that can never die it will never die and that's God for he is eternal ain't that right he he is eternal and and the prophet said that's the only way that we we can ever keep from dying now I I like that here because then that means we can face this year amen and never have to worry about being what we were last year you understand that church a man see the only way that we can ever keep from dying we have to have eternal life in us to be Sons and Daughters of God so you know what that means to be Sons and Daughters of God it's not big because you go to a message church it's not because you you know you think different than than somebody else it's it's it's not because of whatever it's it's because uh uh you have that eternal life that's that's the only way that can make you a son and daughter of God ain't that right and if you've got eternal life that shows that you eat we're Eternal in his thoughts in the first place so so it goes to show that you never was saved on any given day you always were saved amen and God put that Eternal seed in you before the foundation of the world Amen and when you receive leave the holy ghost that Eternal seed become a quicken in this old body ain't that right so we find that lawmakers you know are passing laws that will help make the change that they think is needed uh the churches are are are joining together so to bring on the change that they think is needed and and and uh uh laws are being passed in denominational rims and and and these things and and and and the leaders you know uh uh as as you see I think it was the Methodist Church that people you know are breaking away from it and and because somebody's wanting to change and and and so they're they're they're enforcing these things a man and in most churches we we win uh Heather and I went uh last year I think up up uh Massachusetts way and and up there and and uh I so disgusted you know um we didn't know it we come right at the time of the celebration of homosexuals and oh wow I saw Ray come home I was so sick I just the ungodliness and but you go drive around and every church had a rainbow flag and I thought God have mercy where are we at you know I'm gonna go home but but you know it's because they're looking for change as as they think it will make things better ain't that right and so but the unregenerate man is always trying to bring change without going God's provided way amen God's got to change God God's got a promise a change but but they don't want God's way of change and so they're going to try to bring change on their self but here's the problem Romans 8 and 7 it says the carnal mind is enmity against God so the the what they're working for for change is actually contrary to what God's idea of change should be for it is not subject to the law of God the word of God neither indeed can be I I think that's why it's so important not to try to bring change on your own a man that wait upon the Lord to bring the change ain't that right let the Lord because if it's if it's in his will the change will come but the moment you try to put your hands upon it the moment you try to make it happen in your own will in your own carnal thinking and your own you say but it it seems good and you've got it all figured out but if it's against God's way if it's against God's will that change will come to not you you'll just be working against the laws of God Amen and brother Brown even speaking of Florida you all know what he said about Florida and he said you know when I crossed and went in Florida the first time and come back to Georgia Line there I stood there and I've said as American citizen I give my part back of it to the Seminoles where it belongs you know and he says why they take care of their yards uh better than I do my hair you know and everything feather edged and the palm trees has got lights all over it and big Swanky yachts and everything but notice what he says they're trying to bring a millennium without repentance thing there's that change again they're they're looking for chains there's that groaning a man but they're trying to bring a millennium without God's provided way amen but there is going to be a millennium we don't have to worry about that can you say man for those that have taken God's provided way so so we find this is why the scripture says there in Romans to be carnally minded is death and and to be spiritually minded is life and peace amen we don't want to go through this year carnally minded serving God with our carnal mind trying to bring change with our carnal mind it ain't gonna work it'll just produce death amen but to be spiritually minded is life and peace can you say man so now they're they're looking for change but yet the people of this world has no guarantee a man in all they're changing that they're doing has no guarantee a man that will bring peace upon the Earth they'll have no guarantee that'll make us better uh uh people they they have no guarantee that it's going to do away with the evil and you know good and well they're trying to do away with the evil amen any anything that goes against what their their agenda is and what they're doing again and uh and it's getting worse and you know that amen they're uh uh and we don't I'm not getting into the politics of it but anyone that knows the uh the politics and all these things you know what's happening they're putting people into jail and and all that because they didn't go along with the chains that they're wanting and and it's just a bunch of nonsense but we we find that in this change they're putting their energy into it they're they're spending billions and billions of dollars in the in into uh uh uh uh what what would that word be tests um uh trying things out you know inventions and things amen because they want change that's what they're after they the the they want chains they they want to take away the gas trucks and and and bring in the electric and everything what is they call that green green something you know and uh uh but but it's because they want change they want to you know they want the climate to be better the atmosphere global warming and all of these things they're worried about all these things right and and so we we got to change it before we we we lose uh uh the world right and so you've got all these think tanks and men that are pouring money and and their time their energy and scientists under the pressure of trying to fix all of these things just for a better change but it'll never be right it'll never be it'll never happen it ain't going to happen now now I know we're dumb people I've never been to college and all that but I can tell you this it ain't going to happen I can tell the brightest individual the most wealthiest individual in their think tanks and and all these things up on the earth it ain't going to happen can you say amen I don't either go to college I don't need to know the math about it I don't even know that a prophet said it'll never never happen America is doomed the world is doomed ain't that right and so this ain't the change that that we're looking for as long as we are Mortals there will always be corruption there will always be sin and death there will always be wars and rumors of wars there there will always be sickness pain and headache and heartache and and and and you know the more they try to change things the worse it gets and you know good and well that's that's what it is they've messed with their foods and man becomes weaker amen man becomes sicker man becomes more uh uh uh um that he just becomes more vulnerable to diseases and more vulnerable to to all of the the nonsense that's out here you understand what I'm saying amen because they got better ways they got better ways to raise your child you know I thought it was kind of funny you know someone had put up a a thing of way children were raised in in in um you know uh in the 70s of when when I was raised and I just I thought man I felt at home you know uh you know uh Mama back then if you got your face dirty like that and wipe it off not not these days no no no no you you germs you know you got to get the right Kleenex and and and baby wipe you know wipe that off you know we used to eat dirt you know I was telling my children I used to eat roly-polies y'all y'all know what roly-polies are oh yeah I had a stomach full of them and uh you know they've you know some people say well you're full of baloney no roly-poly yeah roly-polies for me you know but but I I ate them man that was that was a thing oh today you know if your kid done a roly-poly take him to the hospital get that thing his stomach pumped out and and all of these things man you know they want and change but look where it's putting us weaker ain't that right it's true and and and you get someone with the coat no one wants to go to church because that person probably got a code and and we all get it right you know it's just that's just the way it is but you know when we were sick we never missed church it was just you go to church you know and and that's just the way it was and and I I know you know even even as a baby I was a sickly child and and what was what was interesting is my dad's in there getting ready for church shaving my mom screams during during come and he comes running through there and here I am on the bed eyes rolled back blue whatever not breathing and and you know we didn't have cell phones and all that they just got together and they laid hands on me and started started I started breathing and mom didn't say well Darren I'm going to stay home just in case no they they took me to church you know and and they're worshiping the Lord just glorifying God and it's sister Taps mom on the shoulder and looks down and there I am again just as limp as a dish Rag and and and blue eyes rolled back not breathing and my mom you know she doesn't say I just knew it I should have stayed home you know no she she grabbed me up and there I am just as limp as limp can be and and she ran up to the front said pray pray for my baby and the church got together and God brought life back into this body and and and but then were the days right we we just today if we just have to blow the nose you know everybody stays home and you know there's a there was a kid you know there's that song excuses excuses and and you hear them every day and I heard that when I was a kid and I I thought it was funny now I find it's true you know uh uh everybody just stays home because that little old baby or whatever see but but it's because they're looking for change amen the world is changing our our thought pattern they're changing our ideology their changing sad to say they're changing convictions they're changing Faith they're changing everything of how we view this Bible can you say man they put science they put education they put they put everything before us to where we the the the the the the the nominal believer a man lose the sight of the promises of God and they accept change that only makes it worse can you say man I'm not against medication and all that jazz you know I'm just telling you amen and brother Brown just plainly tells us that Faith would be slow in this this day ain't that right so we we find that the the the more they they try to to change things for the better the more evil the more wicked the more sickly amen the world becomes and and and so we're we're living and and you know uh uh you you have if you listen to the prophet yeah at any time you know that we're living in the age of Isaiah's prophecy where Darkness would fill the Earth and gross Darkness the people Darkness covering the Earth and and we're living in that fulfillment right Darkness covering the Earth amen gross Darkness the people go listen to Shalom and brother Branham will explain the attitude of the people and why why he explains everything to us of why the people are acting the way they're acting doing what they're doing and and and you can talk to them and and there's nothing there nothing it's like no one's home and and and these things and he says what it is good people nice people amen but he said it's the gross Darkness they want to do it but gross Darkness keeps them from it you understand so this is where we're at and brother Brown says these great big things coming up is bringing them right into more darkness and more darkness and and I have to say I I think technology is playing a big deal in this I I think everything that they're coming up in science and they're coming up with all these things it's numbing to people's hearts it's numbing them that you know they watch in the movies they're watching the all these killings and the death saying the the nonsense the foolishness and and and anybody can get popularity by just making a dumb stupid video these days and everybody gets a he gets a big hole following amen because he does something stupid and and and you just like good Lord why don't the guy get him a good job amen you know we got McDonald's out there at least you can make some money and and and and do it you know uh uh be a good citizen be good productive you understand what I'm saying but it's gross Darkness it's it's just there and it's in and these things this technology this all these inventions and and and I appreciate them all they've been a great help amen uh but at the same time amen you you have to understand it's sucking people in and and as the prophet said these great big things coming up is bringing them right into more darkness and more Darkness people don't think about God anymore because they're on their dumb phone amen and looking at the YouTubes looking at the videos looking at this Quirk and that comedy and this and that and and and no one's got any time for God before you know it you've spent all them hours on the phone you spend all them hours on the internet you spend all of them hours you ain't got time for family you ain't got time for reading the Bible you ain't got time for prayer you ain't got time now and and I'm just going to be honest with you it's bringing more and more Darkness over the people's minds amen that's right and then they come to church and they can't see the word because the word doesn't affect them they're more affected amen by what they saw on that dumb phone and what they saw on the videos and what they saw on all of that no wonder they're they're getting so soft in their faith amen when someone looks at them wrong they're mad ready to change and everybody's looking for change these days and it doesn't take much to offend people these days to where they go somewhere else to look for change you understand what I'm saying now the prophet's saying it real close and real real strong it's these things coming up now he's saying that in 63 and here we are amen now entering in 23. oh my amen say 63 and we're here in 22 2023. amen and so it's bringing them things right into more darkness and more darkness and God declaring it in his word by signs and wonders and things in the heavens showing foretelling the things that happens just exactly to the hour and to the minute what would take place and then they continually walk right on the same way looks like he says it looks like they just can't help it good people yes sir doing the same thing now as they done back then in Jesus's day can you say amen amen so so here we are they're wanting change but they're in grossed darkness that they can't see what God is doing he they can't see the change that God is bringing on you understand what I'm saying amen there is a bride that is standing on her feet something happened something changed amen and they miss it the world looking for chains and they don't realize amen something changed within this bride amen she's not an infant child church anymore she's standing on her feet amen with the glory of God with the Dynamics of God within her can you say man it's a change that God has done and the world can't see it and they're crying out for Revival because they want change and yet God brought a prophet Amen to bring change to his church we find that what the world actually calls change is nothing but a repeat of what has been in history for the Bible tells us Ecclesiastes 1 9. the thing that has been it is that which shall be and that which is done is that which shall be done and there is no new thing under the sun is there anything aware of it may be said see this is new it has been already of old time which was before us so that's why the prophet would tell us or the Bible a man as it was in the days of Noah so shall it be as it was in the days of lot so shall it be everything is is just a repeat history repeat ain't that right that's that's right see now you know uh just think of the the way people wear clothes and and the style of clothes there's always a repeat of it right and always a repeat you know and and uh I I remember you know uh my grandpa he wore them fat ties and real real wide ties and I remember when the skinny ties came out you know it was a new fad you know but before long here come the big white ties again you know and and it went from the shoes then it come to cleats in your in or uh I think it's what is that cleats in in your in your uh pants you know what is it pleats yeah cleats are for shoes right okay you don't yeah creases but it was funny because yeah uh I guess if you got ran over by cleats you'd see it in your pants but I I like cleats cleats but you know I remember before them pleats come out when I was a kid it was straight then the plates come out and I really like them that's my style then here they come again with straight now my Judah 12 was talking about last night he says I hate pleats I hate them and I'm like what I like them well you give it another time generational come out and the pleats will be back out and his son will go man I hate great pants you know and it's just it's just there's nothing new it's just a repeat of what was so we we find that that it's it's like reading the newspaper you remember the prophet talking about the man reading that newspaper and as he's reading his wife and cooking breakfast and she says hey John anything new he said now now nothing new just different people you know same old murders same old this same old cheating same old this you know it's just different people but there's nothing new ain't that right now we're living in the worst stage ever yeah we're living in the most sinful age ever the most deceitful age ain't that right everything that that was is now conglomerated in this in this age uh uh uh the days of Noah was was an age to itself uh the Sodom and Gomorrah was an age to itself but in this age we depict both ages the sin of of all ages have gathered in this age can you say amen and so we're living in the worst age ever and and and and yet the prophet would tell us it's the most glorious age ever to be and he explains that he said it's because we're living on the brink of Eternity amen where time is fading out and Eternity is coming in and we're right there on the brink oh my aren't you glad for that I I remember uh uh when we went to New Zealand we you know that that we got to a place we actually got to the place in the air where you could see daylight and dark at the same time pitch dark on on one part and and totally lie on another part and I as as I was thinking of this I've taken oh my God that's exactly where the believer is standing amen we are right there to where we can see light and darkness at the same time amen that we are in amen pressing into something church it's a change that that we've been looking for can you say man amen that's right and so that the world gropes in darkness out without any understanding see and you cannot make them understand because of the darkness that is upon them amen and and so they're good people yes and but but would talk to them about the Lord and they just look at you like huh you know if there's nothing there Amen to to make them feel guilty in the presence of God to where they want a better amen to go God's way ain't that right oh they want a better life but they're going to do it on their own no understanding so so when the politicians you know talk about change don't listen to it when when we you know you hear them talk about change on the news amen don't don't be caught up in that amen when the pope even himself is talking about change don't listen to it can you say amen amen when the denominational preachers talk about change don't you listen to that either can you say man because the chains that they're looking for amen is going to take them to the pits of hell yeah you understand what I'm saying it's motivated by the power of Darkness it's making a man way for the Incarnation of Satan himself to be fully completely incarnated in a human being to where he will govern the world as a whole can you say amen and they don't know what change they're looking for they don't realize oh they're crying for messiah and they're trying to make change for that Messiah but it's nothing but the devil incarnated in flesh can you say Amen oh yes sir see anything that is inspired and controlled by Satan all only makes room for him to manifest himself more anything that's why we we don't want our lives to be governed by the devil and we don't want our thoughts to be governed by the devil we don't want our habits to be governed by the devil we don't want this church to be governed this family our families to be governed by the devil can you say amen amen and that's why the Warfare is so great upon you amen is because you're the one that won't let him have his way in your life in your mind in this church can you say amen he can have his way anywhere but don't you have your way in my life in my family in my church in my situation you won't have your way can you say Amen that's right now the prophet says the Bible is the Fountain of all wisdom and holds all hopes everybody say all hopes for the future the Bible is the Fountain of all wisdom and holds all the hopes of the future in it your hope of Futures right here this little book can you say man now you can't have a change for the better without God now in our opening scripture God promised that there will be a change hold I make all things new throughout the Bible you find God speaking of change coming I thought of First Corinthians 15 51. behold I show you a mystery we shall not all sleep but we shall all everybody say all be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye at the last Trump for the trumpet shall sound and the dead shall be raised Incorruptible and we shall be changed oh look at the change and man cannot bring this change on say for this corruptable must put on incorruption and this Mortal must put on immortality so when this corruptable shall have put on incorruption and this Mortal shall have put on immortality then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written death is swallowed up in Victory you go back in the Old Testament and you find how that God changed Abraham and Sarah ain't that right a man not only did he change them back to their youth again but he changed the whole situation he changed their condition for when they were young to begin with they couldn't have children and so the prophet said he'd done more than just changed them back to the youth because they'd still be in the same boat not been able to have children but God changed them amen from old to Young and he changed the situation can you say amen that's exactly right now you you you're so so and brother Brown says now he changed Abraham and Sarah back to their youth again and back to everything changed them to show what he would do with you and I oh aren't you glad for that we are in the day that that was speaking of you are the people that God had in his mind when he changed them back so you could look back and see a change and realize that's the changes I'm looking for that's the change I'm not looking for a politician change I'm not looking for a governmental change I'm not looking for a presidential change I'm not looking for any change like that the change I'm looking for is God Amen changing me back you look at job and he said all the days of my appointed time will I wait till my change come oh he's looking for change amen I'm gonna wait ain't that right wait till my change come and notice this is the important thing because in the next verse he tells how the change will come he says that will call I will answer oh amen that's the change that's how the change comes thou will call and I will answer ain't that right so this change ain't coming by way of a politician the change ain't coming by way of Technology neither is it coming by some way of a seminary Seminary chicken preacher amen is not coming amen by some other way amen but job says Thou will call and I will answer can you say amen hallelujah if you're dependent upon a republican Amen to get you a better life amen you better look somewhere else if you're looking for a Democrat independent or whatever you are Amen to bring you a better life you better look somewheres else honey amen before job that gives us the answer when you call I'll answer ain't that right when you call then it's important we better hear his voice then we better take heed to what the prophet said there's other voices out there drowning out the voice of God and you say Amen so this change ain't coming by way of anything else but God now this fits this fits with what Paul said in first Thessalonians 4 16. for the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of an archangel of the Archangel and with feet Trump of God can you say amen and what's going to happen then when this happens and I I just brothers and sisters there we are in this age right there amen now when this happens the dead in Christ is going to rise first ain't that right so the change is going to start with the dead in Christ the rest of the Dead live not for another Thousand Years there's going to be people just laying the grave and they're going to sit there amen but there's going to be something amen the voice of God is going to bring a change to every believer that has already gone into the grave yes sir then when we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds now we know what the prophet says amen about this in all these events amen is that that the dead will rise and they'll come and visit us those that are are founded in the word those that are believers those that are anchored those that are Rapture Ready amen they're going to be visited by these Saints amen that have gone on whether it be a loved one whether it be Paul that comes and knocks on your door whether it be Daddy whether it be Mama whether it be wife husband child it doesn't matter when they rise they're going to come and begin to knock on your door brother Walker amen and you're going to know Roxanne it's time to go can you say man you're going to know amen the change is here I don't know about you but I can face two 20 and 23 with such a promise as that for I know the change is coming [Applause] the change the change then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air you know some people believe that caught up is just Revelation getting caught up in Revelation they do away with the rapture well I got good news for you right now that's exactly against what the prophets taught and the Bible teaches I believe in getting caught up in Revelation but that's not what that scripture is saying because the dead in Christ hasn't risen so we're going to just sit here looking like dumb you ignorant people amen until the dead in Christ rise and then we get caught up in Revelation or what that's not the way the Bible reads that's not the way it is can you say Amen the Revelation is happening right now amen why it's building rapturing faith right now you're not waiting for rapturing faith rapturing faith is already being applied to you ain't that right so notice amen that will call and I will answer first the shout the voice of the Archangel the Trump of God ain't that right and then the dead in Christ and then the change happens oh my and what happens when that change comes death and Corruption will give way and the dead in Christ will rise those who are alive and remain are going to be caught up to meet the Lord and Corruption death old uh uh age or whatever is going to leave them tonight and and and you you know good and well the prophet taught us that it'll leave you corruption is going to leave you before you're caught up ain't that right didn't he talk about you you one of these days you'll be combing that old gray hair in the mirror and all of a sudden it changes Lord have mercy what a change what a change Hallelujah don't don't don't be looking for fads to change you don't look for better fashion to change you I don't care if you look old and and fuddy duddy I don't care what you look like to the world it doesn't matter you just keep before you A change is coming A Change Is Coming it'll be a better change than what the the the the the fashion designers can make it'll be a a better change than what the dressmakers can make and the makeovers and all that with their makeup and all their nonsense and their hair dies and all you know you know how they are trying to make everything up and all their operations and everything looking for a better change amen but it ain't it's going to be a better change than that can you say man why it'll be your very Creator that'll change you it'll change you back to what he thought of you in the beginning and it'll be a perfect body it'll be a perfect design it'll be a perfect fashion change gravity will lose its hold talking about change gravity gonna lose its hold you know these these guys that go up Beyond gravity to the Moon they got to come back down but when this change happens there will never be a gravity Force It'll be such a different atmosphere It'll be such a different way death will then be defeated ain't that right why you're changed from corruptable to incorruptable Philippians 3 21 tells us that God is going to change our vile body that it may be fashioned likened to his own glorious body now no fashion designer can fashion that right there this is a fashion that God will do oh my and I'm look so looking forward to it then your groaning will be over can you say man see you know they they they could they could they the fashion designers and the makeovers brother Walker Sister Walker sister Jane you Elders brother Bill they they could do the fashion for you but it'll never change it'll never take the aches and pains he'll never take that oldness away when you get up and you just uh it'll never take the stiff joints away they they just making it look over you know you're just an old man old woman looking over made made different but they can never take the reality of the old way but oh God's gonna take it away you're gonna take away the sorrow can you say man now notice Isaiah 65 17 for behold I create new heavens and a new Earth and the former shall not be remembered nor come into mind but be glad and rejoice forever in that which I create for behold I create Jerusalem a rejoicing and her people a joy ain't that right notice what the promise so am I and I will rejoice in Jerusalem and joy in my people there will be nothing but joy happiness gladness and the voice of weeping shall be heard no more in her nor the voice of crying aren't you glad for that what a change that's going to be no more weeping no more crying no more sorrow no more heartaches no more loneliness hey you know how it is when you begin you worship God in church or at home and yet that'll arthritis is still bothering you and you're praising God and your eyes are still bothering you and you're praising God you're trying to sing songs you're you're loving the Lord but there's always that that's something there that's reminding you you ain't home yet amen but what we find is there's going to be a place a man to where you can worship God and there will not be a broken heart with it amen you can worship God and there will not be a pain mixed with it you can worship God and there will not be a doubt there with it amen you can worship God and you're not have to push aside amen evil spirits and condemnation spirits and and everything else trying to stop you from worshiping God there's going to be a change and that change amen when the change comes the devil's going to be gone what a change that'll be can you say amen amen as long as as long as we're in this life no matter what change there is the devil's always there ain't that rhyme amen no matter how old you get the devil is always there Amen to remind you of what you are and what you've done and what this and try to prevent you from pressing on that I say to you press on he knows his time is short he knows amen he ain't gonna bother you anymore he knows that it'll never be able to bring tears to your eyes again he knows all that he'll never be able to break your heart again he knows what a change that's coming what a change when Jesus came as the Prince of Peace brother Branham asked the question why wasn't there peace then he answers is because all the word wasn't fulfilled in his day so he couldn't bring peace like the world is looking for but look he says when every promise everybody say every promise when every promise is fulfilled death is swallowed up in Victory Jesus Will Come and the last one is Vindicated then there will come an eternal peace upon the Earth and an eternal shalom and eternal Shalom peace will rest upon the Earth oh my when every promise is fulfilled brothers and sisters I hope I'm making sense to you I'm preaching to myself that all I can say is be diligent with the word get your eyes off of every stinking thing that is trying to hold you back get your eyes off of every unbelief every skepticism everything amen quit listen to all the voices that are out there listen to that word stay intently do the word why because you're the people to fulfill the word you're the last people to fulfill the last promises that pertain to this Bride Can you say amen and when every promise Last Promise is fulfilled then there will be Eternal peace can you say amen I I don't know about you but the Millennium amen I don't expect to live this year out I just don't I I just you know uh um you know I I I know we got to plant the potatoes and we got to do whatever we got to do but I tell you why we're doing that brother Branham said live every day as though Jesus is coming that minute can you say man and I believe he's coming I just believe it and it just can't be long amen and notice what brother Branham says he's here fulfilling his word today every promise that he has made listen you're the last generation you're the last age you're the last people amen you're the finale God has waited for you to come don't you understand that brother Brown said if I was given the choice of any age to live in I'd pick it right now amen you are the greatest age ever to be you're the greatest people ever to be amen we're not putting no one previous down that's not the point amen but you're the climax of God's thoughts you are the climax amen and why is the pressure on you than it has been in any other age think of that you're under the greatest pressure you're under the greatest battles that has ever been fives right now amen because you are the one that's going to finish this thing and they without us cannot be made perfect your every 10 their testimony amen is waiting on you amen their lies are depending upon you have been very courage is dependent upon you if we don't make it they died in vain if you don't make it they went to the uh burned to the stake in vain can you say Mahana for even though they're up there in their theophany they cannot come back into that body Amen to where death can be defeated until you make it only when you make it then death will be defeated and they will be able to come back into their bodies so you think of it they're in heaven waiting on you we look to be there oh if I could just die if I could just go if I could just be whatever I'd be in a better place okay I'll give you that but you know what they're actually there it's been holding this ain't done yet we got to have you to finish the race so we can be made perfect can you say Amen we got to have you to finish this race so that we can fulfill scriptures too and that is the dead would raise and that body though it's been scattered by the Four Winds of the Earth it's going to come back and you say man it's going to come back what a change you love him so this new year doesn't cause us to have the same expectations as the world has second Peter 3 13. says we according to his promise we everybody say we according to his promise that's how we enter this year we according to his promise look for new heavens and a new Earth wherein dwelleth righteousness see he made you righteous now and there's a place he's made for you to inhabit and you say man wherein dwelleth righteousness not unrighteousness so you just stay true to the word you just stay true to what God's called you to do just keep keep plugging on you say well I'm not getting anywhere keep plugging ain't that right yes sir so he's the one that promised it so this is how we look into the new year this is how we Face the year is we according to his promise we're looking for a new Heaven and a new Earth Allelujah then we reckon ourselves soldiers pilgrims and sojourners so he promised it and our expectation comes from the Lord now I'm gonna try to hurry but see the change has already begun God started this change with us as individuals ain't that right in second Corinthians 5 17 Paul said If any man be in Christ he is a new creature or a new creation old things everybody say old things are passed away have you experienced that old things are passed away behold all things everybody say all things are become new see the change has already come the old years died the new has begun the old man has died the new man has begun can you say man yes sir see so he is a new creation his desires are changed from old to new his life is changed from old to new his nature is changed from old to to new ain't that right so the old has died out and has given birth to the new for he is a new creation but that doesn't stop amen the believer that doesn't stop us a man from wanting change crying out for change brother Brandon said when you receive the Holy Ghost people think that's that's that's all there is to it we've arrived he said no you're just beginning ain't that right but as long as you're in this Mortal life there is still a groaning to change now I understand brother Branham said your groaning is over amen uh uh and and yes that you're at a risk or you should be in a rest to where you can take God's word and and rest in that word but but that doesn't mean that we're just content with life here but we're always looking forward to change we're always looking forward Amen to something amen see uh uh now now see we we know a man that we can't be lost amen uh because we have been sealed to the day of our Redemption I'm talking about Holy Ghost Field Believers we can never be a sinner again right we can never go back to the old life that we once lived so so our time of groaning is over Amen in in that way we we we it's it's a done deal I'm going in the Rapture I'm I'm going because there's his witness beareth witness with my spirit that I am a Son of God don't don't don't get me wrong yes thoughts of Doubt always tries to Prevail and tell me that I'm not a son of God Amen and I as as the Bible says the just shall live by faith the just shall walk by faith everything it's a faith walk it's a faith talk it's a it's a faith confession you you understand what I'm saying amen so the times that you just don't feel like amen you're fit for it I'm going anyway you know the times that I just don't think I can make it I'm gonna make it anyway amen he's the high priest of My Confession can you say amen and I don't know about you you can either sit there I can sit there and just Waller and self-pity and let the devil fight us until we're beat down to where we ain't got nothing or we can take God at his word and say come live hell or high water I'm going to serve the Lord job we can never go back because the old life is dead that nature is gone but yet the believer still desires to change for in second Corinthians 3 17 talk Paul talks about beholding as in a glass we beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord uh probably 16. the glory of the Lord are changed into the same image from glory to glory so you you changing did not just happen or let's set this way your complete change and and I say that reverently but but hopefully you you to understand that your complete change did not just happen overnight when you received the Holy Ghost I I guess it's like a baby uh developing it's boring it's had a birth but now it develops into adulthood and and with that change see as he develops he changes ain't that right and just got her license the other day blessed my heart and I told her I said you need to let your brothers know so they can stay off the sidewalks but she she got her license the other day she's so excited and well and so we're excited with her in a different way but yeah you're right but you know as I I I've really done a lot of pondering about just cried to see my daughter uh getting old enough to drive not because it raises my insurance and all that I mean that's a lot to cry about but but just to see the change to see when she first began to walk there in Pennsylvania she uh we were sitting there with brother Jim Shoemake he was him and his sister D was over at her house and where we were staying we were eating and out of the clear blue no one taught her nothing she just comes out of the bedroom and starts walking through the hall walk in the living room and we all dropped our Forks and Road Jim reminds me they have that occasionally and and now she's driving I remember you know you heard three years old and Rebecca was teaching the children school at home and and so she's asked them the question all right who's the first president in the United States who's the first president and three years old in the living room George Washington she passed the test and now she here she is driving but with that development come change weakness changes into strength immaturity changes into maturity ignorance changes into knowledge inability changes into ability irresponsibility changes into responsibility right the way we see things change the way we hear things change they way we act upon things change the way we understand things changes ain't that right because even though there's a birth there's always a change and within that child you know there if if the child is normal with normal behavior then he's always pressing for change change and and you know uh uh Daniel and Brittany's which you know all you you all of you this got children it's the same thing but uh it just reminds me a little Titus and and them uh uh Autumn but Autumn you know just you're I don't know how old is she a month three months four months oh it's gonna say oh time's changing here but yeah uh so three months and you know it wasn't I mean just wouldn't seemed like when she just got home she's already trying to raise her head you know and and she's very you know wants the she wants to be independent she wants to set up she tried to it's telling me last night you know that she's trying to set up but why is because there's something there that's calling out for change I don't want to be held all my life I I I I I don't want to just lay around all my life you understand what I'm saying and as we're talking we're thinking it won't be long she's going to be crawling it ain't gonna be long she's gonna be walking ain't gonna be long she's gonna be driving you know it just it's constant change reaching out for chain well if that's in the natural so is it in the spiritual can you say man you don't want to just stay in your walleye for too long there's something in you calling for change amen and and that's why I believe there's Mercy for that believer I just believe that when you fall down God doesn't hold that to you because there's a desire for change God I'm gonna get back up and I'm I I oh I made I was telling the a preacher the other day you know asking for some advice just I want Pastor advice sometime and and I said I've made so many mistakes and I've made just uh you know all these things and I just wish I could go back and do better and and and and these things of of certain things and and and and and and you know uh uh as it just come to me but there he is his mercies are are from endurance forever they're new Every Morning amen and I believe that's the way with every individual if you're truly a Believer there's a desire for change amen there's a desire Amen to get closer there and that's what I pray for amen me there for this new year as We Gather the family around last night Amen to pray I want to change I want to be a better father I want to be a better husband I want to be a better Pastor I want to be a better Christian I I want to please my Lord better I I want to draw closer to him I I just want to you understand what I'm saying not that I have to but it's something in me amen it's not that word you know that that you you demand your baby to start walking you just know it's going to come because there's a desire that's already there amen and you just give it some time and it's going to grow change change so as it is in the natural so as it is in the spiritual brother Brown talks about us laying in the presence of the Sun to ripen to ripen you'll never change in denomination there's nothing there to change you you'll you'll never change under Seminary nothing changed you ain't that right the message is the revealing of the son of man and under in that presence you ripen there's a change developing can you say man you'll never change you'll never change by New Year's resolutions you'll never change by discussing problems in your home about the church about your husband wife children you'll never change that way except for the worse we see it all the time but if you want to change for the better it's the message ripening Under the Sun in the presence of the Sun ain't that right so every believer has that desire in brother branham's prayer he said May the old man sin and unbelief die out in her heart and the New Birth come in with the 1963 like a rushing Mighty Wind that might fill our beings that make us new creatures in Christ that's in 1963 at a new year he's praying this type of a prayer you see the new year for the believer brings new hope why we're one year closer we're one day now closer every hour it comes we're one hour closer and it brings new expectations and you say man see we're not going back to what has been but we are getting closer to what God has promised us in the future brother Branham in his prayer or as he's preaching there in the message Shalom he says I want to see what's promised for the day I want to know what the light of the hour is so I can know how to walk in it I want to know where I'm living what age I'm in how far up the road I am or how far up the road am I right now we look and and I think this is beautiful and I pray that it it really sinks into our hearts mind but brother Brown he's talking there he says a word is a thought expressed God in his thinking thought it and expressed it through His prophets and now it has to be fulfilled so now we know what word has to be fulfilled it is the things that have to be fulfilled is what was spoken by the prophets and when he foretold us of these things you see he's foretold us of these things so we wouldn't make a mistake and blunder in darkness then when we see it being fulfilled so so he showed us rich in mercy God being merciful we could enter into this year with our eyes open the light shining to where we can see what needs or what has to be and what is being fulfilled so we don't make a mistake and walk and blunder in darkness you understand what I'm saying millions billions of people walking entering into this year in darkness groping for change groping about trying to change and they don't know what it's all about the world has to change America has to change the economy has to change everything has to change it's all falling rotten place to give way to another kingdom are you with me yes sir so we're not entering this year groping in darkness just stumbling around God by his Mercy had shed the light to let us know what is to be now notice Philippians 3 13 Paul says forgetting those things which are behind and reaching forth unto those things which are before brother Brown said it this way to the complete identification when all time will fade out into eternity when Jesus comes that's what we're pressing for that's what we're reaching out for is to the complete identification when all time will fade out into eternity when Jesus comes oh my there will be a millennium there will be a time where the old will become new young can you say man the sickness will fade away death will be no more and as Isaiah prophesied they shall build houses and they will inhabit them they'll plant Vineyards and we'll eat the fruit thereof they will not plant in another inhabit in other words brother Brown said his son taking it see after him his son will be living by him the prophet said amen see the wolf and the lamb shall eat together the lion shall eat straw like the Bullock a child shall lead them around showing that there's going to be nothing but innocence there ain't that rack No One's Gonna Be there to hurt or to destroy man the wild nature of our of the Beast will no longer be there and all I can say is we're at the end time The Junction is here I got more and more to go but I'm gonna close if the musicians will come the end time is here oh do you love him can you lift your hands and just worship Him hallelujah hallelujah I love the Lord I love the Lord he's so wonderful to us oh God help us God help us to keep pressing on help us Lord to keep enduring I wonder if we could just stand to our feet for a moment maybe we could join hands with one another [Music] this this year's for some reason has been more I've taken this year coming year to be more sober than I have in other years just for my life for the church here and I wonder if we could just dedicate ourselves to the Lord as as we face this year you know what you've maybe lacking and as the prophet would do as we enter this year is look back and see the mistakes that we've made and ask God to forgive us of them is a lord take our hand Lord and walk with the sin can you just pray in your own way but father our hearts are longing for home [Music] we're yearning for that place Lord of change we're all the Mind battles and The Temptations will be done with but Lord we're just dependent upon your grace and your mercy that you would forgive us of all of our sins of the past years oh God we don't want to do them Lord [Music] and we're asking that you would hold our hand as we walk in this Dark Age this year to come we don't know the future of this year you could take us all home or you could just take call someone home here but Lord may we be ready may we press the battle Lord [Music] we just drop everything that just seems so important in this world and we can just grab hold of the word [Music] I know we can get tired and discouraged Satan has a way of of trying to paint a picture of hopelessness Lord and help us not to entertain them thoughts help us not to believe them lies may we hold the word dear to us Lord I pray you'd help this Church Father we've gone through many battles many things Lord but may your people be encouraged today may we press on as a body of Believers here help us in our homes help us men to be more consecrated and dedicated to be better Godly husbands and fathers help the women Lord to be better mothers and better Godly examples not that we're not Lord not that they're not but that's just our desire Lord give us the grace oh more grace is what we ask for we thank you Lord we love you foreign [Music] bless your holy name isn't the Lord just wonderful oh he's so wonderful to us [Music] oh God [Music] can we sing my faith looks up to you is that old song I don't know uh triath

in a wonderful time shalom peace to you you have the word down in your heart chose before the foundation of the world to hear the word for this day if you don't it's about four year for you ahead but if you are it's a great world for you ahead or a great day great year coming now the new year I'm glad we have the word in our heart it's our hope it's our life [Music] may God bless you May Grant you the grace to keep pressing on this year may we never lose sight of the goal may we never lose sight of the us I wished I could go on but if you could listen to the shalom priesthood twice I believe it'll be a real help to you amen so God bless you for those that would like to meet for lunch we reserved their conference room there at the Holiday Inn Express hotel in Blacksburg so [Music] um so they're in Blacksburg so he had hit 460 like you're going to [Music] Princeton that way and get off on Priceless Fork Road not the first exit but go under the bridge and it'll Loop you around and then the first stop light the whole is right there so if you want to get you something to eat and would like to come and visit we would love to have you and remember communion at 4 30 tonight 4 30 be communion is going to be having song and then go right into communion and we was going to start at 4 30 to keep the time I guess everybody's here though I I think it was put out at four announced at four if everybody would want to have it at four since it is just songs and communion we can do that where you will allow so how many would want it at four [Music] raise your hand who would want it at 4 30. so well it's outvoted so we'll do it at four but from one now on we will have services at 4 30. every Sunday evening and for this you know uh this year coming we're not going to be doing every other Sunday night or evening like we've been doing we'll be having Services every Sunday night maybe once a month we can get together for Fellowship we'll try to get that out uh worked out but I know we try to get Camp Christie booked several months back for this year and they're already blew up they had nothing that we could do until September so I really thank the Lord that we had our tent our meeting reserved but they wouldn't they said we couldn't use the camp Christie for our fellowship and until September and that's how busy they are but uh so from now on we will be having evening services and uh I I would like to once at least once a month take an evening service and have Fellowship eating like we did but also take that time after that and talk to the young couples and young people and have a Bible study or something and question and answers things like that and uh I think that would be good too so anyways God bless you and if you have any questions concerning that just just talk to me if I haven't made that clear if I've said something that maybe you didn't understand on that but so remember tonight four o'clock be communion and then tomorrow night on will be at seven o'clock and then Saturday be five and then Sunday at 11. so God bless you love you appreciate you may you have a good afternoon amen let's just bow our heads precious Lord as we depart from this place may your presence always linger with us father
