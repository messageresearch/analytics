amen and we certainly want to give him that honor amen praise the Lord amen if you have your Bibles we will just go into the word um Genesis 22 and we'll start at the first verse but uh enjoyed the songs the specials Sister Lisa enjoyed that and um amen it's just good to come together with the people of God and Worship the Lord praise the Lord I don't know of any other place I'd want to be um than to be around Believers amen and um you know there's more of a kindred among Believers than there is even kin folk and um because we you know the Bible calls us the household of faith and there's just something about it amen that we just have something in common and that's just God and we've all been eternally touched by him amen and we know this world isn't our home and we're just passing through and so our we're citizens of another country the Bible says and um God is our King and um so we've um got something to look forward to we want to remember that we're going to have communion uh this Sunday evening and coming up and so we want to remember that we had a a good time there at the uh uh last Sunday in the fellowship fall festival and uh thought the service was just really good and seemed like the presence of the Lord come Among Us and uh brother Ben done a good job there ministering and uh appreciate all the the the hard work uh the cooking and um appreciate Sister Kim uh for getting it all together and organizing it and I seemed like everybody just had a good time of just relaxation and fellowshipping amen with one another and so uh we're thankful for that uh before we uh read let's go in to prayer and invite uh the presence of the Lord and and as Daniel had mentioned uh sister berer um brother Thomas berer uh Pastor there in in uh Kentucky she uh had uh was kind of feeling not feeling good or whatever and went to the doctor and found out she's ate up with cancer and so I know that's got to be devastating news uh to to them but uh they're asking for prayer so we want to continue to pray and I'd implore you to do that and and um uh take this upon your heart CU you know no matter how bad it seems we know that God works in the impossible amen he is our only hope amen and so we'll just pray father truly you are worthy of our praise our worship and so often we're guilty Lord of not giving you what you deserve but Lord I pray that you would help us to become more conscience of your presence and when we become conscience of your presence we know that we're in the presence of someone greater than a president president or a king or whatever it would be Lord for you are the supreme god you rule and Reign Over All and father Lord you are our savior you are merciful god and we wouldn't be here today without you and help us Lord to be more sincere than ever before and to walk with you and Lord to desire to please you wholly if there's anything in our lives that's not pleasing to you I pray that you would take it out father Lord I'm asking now that you would just minister to your people uh help me to get myself out of the way and that You' speak through these mortal lips father for Lord you alone know the needs and know how to meet them and I pray that you would do so tonight in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen we'll turn uh the the Book of Genesis um very familiar scripture um here but we'll start at the first verse and it came to pass after these things that God did him to Abraham and said unto him Abraham and he said behold here am I he said to take now thy son thine only son Isaac whom thou lovest and get thee into the land of Moriah and offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee of and Abraham rose up early in the morning and saddled his ass and took uh two of his young men with him and Isaac his son and clave the wood for the burnt offering and Rose up and went unto the place which God had told him then on the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes and saw the place a far off and Abraham said unto his young men abide ye here with the ass and I and the lad will go Yonder and worship and come again to you now that's a statement of faith ain't it and Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering and laid it upon Isaac his son and he took the fire in his hand and a knife and they went both of them together and Isaac spake unto Abraham his father and said father or my father and he said here am I my son and he said behold the fire and the wood but where is the Lamb for the burnt offering and Abraham said my son God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering so they went both of them together and they came to the place which God had told him of and Abraham built an altar there and laid the wood in order and bound Isaac his son and laid him on the altar upon the wood and Abraham stretched forth his hand and took the knife to slay his son and the angel of the Lord called unto him out of heaven and said Abraham Abraham and he said here am I and he said late not thine hand upon the lad neither do thou uh anything unto him for now I know that thou fearest God seeing that thou Hast not withheld thy son thine only son from me and Abraham lifted up his eyes and looked and behold uh behind him a ram caught in in a Thicket by his horns and Abraham went and took the RAM and offered him up for a burnt offering in the stad of his son and Abraham called the name of that place Jehovah Gyra as it is said to this day in the Mount of the Lord it shall be seen then if you'll turn to the book of Hebrews the 12th chapter and just go to read part of the second verse the the first part of it Hebrews chap 12 and uh two but it says looking un Jesus the author and finisher of our faith amen you can be seated this evening if I have a title to use I guess I would use looking unto Jesus I I was actually going to speak on something totally different tonight and on the way to church just felt to go this direction so I hope uh something will be said to help you and uh but we're very familiar with Abraham's life and and the story we're familiar with the story um and and I guess a lot of us or most of us could could uh say that we're familiar with his life in in a personal way uh in in some way or another because Abraham's life is a type of our life he it uh very similar his journey very similar to ours um and and um he was a type of of us the elect of God the Chosen and of course we we the first time we hear of uh Abraham his name was Abram and he's an idolator he's in the land of ER I believe um um a part of the Babylonian Kingdom uh the prophet would tell us and so he knows nothing about about God who God is he's a heathen his family's Heathen uh doing all the Heathen ways but then God appeared to him and it must have been some real reality to Abraham for Abraham to uh it caught his attention but it Arrested his heart it it God was able to Captivate um Abraham's heart he didn't need to study it out he didn't need to go find all the books to learn about this God who is speaking to him it it was a supernatural connection and and of course we know what that would be and that is the predestinated seat of God that was laying there Abraham was predestinated and God knew Abraham before the foundation of the world and so God had a purpose for Abraham and and and and this plan just as he has a purpose for us and so God wouldn't have wasted his time calling Abraham or even introducing himself to Abraham in in a personal way if if he knew that Abraham wasn't going to respond but Abraham uh responded and but God not only just introduced himself to Abraham but he told Abraham uh get get thee out of Thy Thy country get get away from your Kindred get away from all these idols and just just get away from everything I've got a land for you and Abraham without questioning and I think that is the Marvel of it Abraham without questioning God asking proof of God just followed now we we know that he took his dad with him and he took lot and and these things but the and and and Abraham that that was to be a separation that would come but uh regardless Abraham did leave that land and he began to search for a land he he he uh uh started out on a journey that would change his life and and that is all of us here we're not just here as church members uh if if it was just about joining a church we could join any church it's not just about us believing in something different than maybe what other religions believe in and all of these things that's not that's not it we we can there's other people that believe in a prophet and there's other people that that different religions that believe in Malachi for is to come of course we believe that brother brandham uh uh fit that description and fulfilled that scripture but but there's other people that that that have ideas and and things like that so why are we different well it's it's the same thing that made Abraham different is that God came to us in a personal way I I I would trust that that's happened to all of us here this evening not only to uh you older ones but to you young people whether you were raised in the message or not it's it's got to come to you and God to where that God some at some point reveals himself to you in a personal way you can know all about brother brandom you can know all about the quotes and and be taught in the message and that's good and and you're you're better off to be be that way but it it takes God to give you that personal relationship and I I think that's that's what we we need is a personal relationship with God I I think so often that people just forget about that they learn about God through head knowledge but they lack that personal relationship and and it's not the head knowledge that's going to to keep you through the times of trouble it's the personal relationship that you have with God and and so we we understand that this is what Abraham had was he started out with that his walk was actually a personal relationship it was a walk with Christ it was a walk that he would begin to learn about this God that had come to him and and the whole life of of Abraham is God showing Abraham to Abraham revealing himself to Abraham and I and and and church if if if we go through life no matter how old we are in God as far as when we say old Christian I'm I've been a Christian you know we say well I've been a Christian for 50 years or I've been a Christian for 10 years or whatever if if if in your journey that God is not revealing himself to you more and more in a personal way something's wrong with that relationship something's wrong with that that that profession because this is what God done to Abraham he he he he he started Abraham out on a journey for the sole purpose leave all of them Gods behind Abraham you you know all about them you and and no doubt he did maybe there was go rain gods and and and certain types of Gods uh a god of fertility a God of this and a god of that and and he knew all about these gods of course none of them would answer but but but he was trained in them things it it it it was an idol worship it was an i a place of idolatry and and none of them uh none of his his priest or whatever uh could tell him about this this this God here uh uh that uh this unknown God if you want to call it that way but but God had come to Abraham so so that he could reveal himself uh uh uh to to Abraham in a personal way get him away from all these other gods get him away from all this other worship get him away from all this uh uh uh this teaching that would draw him to other things to where Abraham was totally dependent upon God himself and it would be through this relationship that that Abraham would know the one true God he would know that that this God was was a God that would answer this this is the god that would keep his promises this is a God that would never leave him or never fail him this was a God that that that could could could do the impossible can you say Amen but well before Abraham could understand that God could do the impossible God had to do something that that that would be impossible so he you know through through the life of of Abraham we know that God uh uh promised that that uh uh Abraham would be a father of Nations and Abraham never had a child and he said that it would be through Sarah that he would have a son and and and and in this son he would be blessed and and and and you know the story and and and what what what is is is amazing is is is God would promise Abraham something that Abraham could not do in himself sarak could not do in herself ain't that right so so see uh uh and and and that's the way uh uh uh uh God does us he's called us out of the World Church we we we know through the life of Abraham that God does not want us looking at all of the things that we're used to and and these other gods and making Idols out of things uh the world's made so many Idols out of things amen for their comfort for for their supplier of needs and we know that none of these gods have been able to help the world's in a worse condition than ever before do you believe that and and so whether it's a a a politician or whether it's in the medical field or whether it's in the sports or whether it's in whatever we can make Gods out of anything we we can make God out of our house and we can make God out of our cars and we can make a God out of ourselves or you you know uh brother Bram even talks about women being being uh uh uh worshiped in this age and and there but there's so many well the prophet said there's so many Vo voes in this age that is drowning out the voice of God I want everyone to listen to me and so we we find that that through through all of these things uh uh God has called us to come out of the world he's called us Church to be separated how many believes that to be separated see see so so that that we Abraham God didn't want Abraham going back there there's no place where where God calls somebody to come out that he allows them to go back he did not want Israel when he called them out of Egypt to turn back even though Egypt now listen Egypt amen or or Israel because they they God brought them out of Egypt but he couldn't get out Egypt out of them when the hard times come they always look back oh we had it better there we had it better there we had it better and and they forgot about the slavery they forgot about they were in a helpless condition they forgot amen that God could actually help them so they go back well that was with s lot and his wife and and all that God told them don't you look back come out but don't you look back and and we find out that that that a uh Lot's wife looked back see amen so so God God didn't God called Abraham out not to ever return back back again not to go back to that thing and God has called us out for the same reason do you believe that so we we find that that we have been C out of the world to walk with God and and he he too has given us promises that it is totally absolutely impossible for us to fulfill on ourselves it is totally impossible amen for the church to fulfill it it's it's totally impossible for any any politician government uh uh uh doctor or whatever to fulfill God gives us promises that that that uh uh we we have to stand upon his word and and just simply believe God the problem is is we tried to make things happen we tried to bring things uh uh to pass and this is exactly what Sarah did she didn't have that Faith like like Abraham did as as we all know she got discouraged amen with it and and she was in her time of of trial and and she uh uh convinced Abraham to to take Hagar for for a a uh uh wife or a maid or or whatever and a concubine and and have have a child and and of course we know he had a child ain't that right they they he uh uh Hagar had a child ishmail and and but ishma was not part of the promise amen Israel was not part of God's promise it never changed God's mind and and ishmail has been a a thorn in in the side of of the promised seed for all these years ain't that right see it's it's still been in and and and I'll be honest with you our doubt sometimes can cause things to come up in our life that becomes a problem to us ain't that right it it becomes a problem to us it becomes a hindrance to us it becomes a sticker or Thorn in our flesh see and and and so but but we find that that even though uh uh uh uh uh uh Sarah tried had uh uh to to make this thing happen amen uh uh through Hagar it never changed God's mind whatsoever and that never did see and and so then then we find that it takes patience everybody say it takes patience it takes patience to walk with God Amen a lot of times we want things in a hurry sometimes we don't understand God's ways of of doing things we we don't understand why God allows things to happen in our lives we wonder why he terries uh uh uh in in delivering the promise in fulfilling the promise but sometimes we have to wait and be patient upon God that's the part of Walking with God can you say Amen if you're going to walk with God if you you say well I'm a Christian I'm I'm going to serve God then then you're going to have to serve him with patience you're going to have to serve him waiting sometimes upon the promise amen ain't that right why because God moves in his own time God's not man he doesn't work like man God God works in his own way God's ways are higher than our ways his thoughts are higher than our thoughts amen and and so he moves in his own time he fulfills his word not when we want him to do it but he does it in his own time and it's in these times that we must not get discouraged while we're waiting upon the promise we can't get discouraged we can't just just Cast Away our confidence can you say amen he moves in his own time now Romans 8 and 24 I I didn't even give y all these scriptures so uh for we are saved by hope but hope that is seen is not hope so we're not saved by things that we see amen but but uh uh for what a man seeth then why does he yet hope for it would be easy to to have everything at our our our fingertips it would be easy to understand everything of why we're going through things and and we wouldn't have to wait for it and and it just everything just coming but if if that did then You' never have to wait for it you'd never have to hope for it it would be there ain't that right but he says but if we hope for that we see not then do we with patience wait for it can you say Amen how many's hoping in things that you cannot see amen well you have to if you're going to walk with God you're going to have to wait for things that you cannot see because the promises are uh uh are beyond your ability the promises are Beyond amen your understanding so many times Amen to where you just have to wait for it God says he going to deliver you well you you say well I've been having issues and I just don't know and I just don't know you've got to wait for it what about healing well there's times that well God does heal amen sometimes instantly but a lot of times he doesn't do it that way and you have to sit there and wait for it but you can't give up but see in in all of this God is trying to show us that he's God he's not a God that just a fix and quick fix quick quick fix you know that that's not what God is amen it's not that God wants to answer our every wh God wants us to have a relationship with him to where we can understand that it doesn't matter how difficult it is he's still God it doesn't matter how how long it takes he's still God it doesn't matter if corruption takes it over and is sitting there spoonful of dust he's still God he's still God that's right that's good if God gave us everything we wanted on a whim you'd never know God for what he is you'd never understand that how many times have you've gone through things that you think you just bubbled you know I I remember when I was I don't know how old I was but I couldn't swim and me and Dad went down a a big water slide and of course I always been short and it was deep and I didn't have a life jacket and Dad just was walking off and I'm sitting there bubble up and down you know and I'd go under Ando you know and actually it happened at the lake one time everybody mom and them was on the shore and I got out too far and I was going up and down but I thought this is my last time I was I was trying to scream I couldn't scream I getting water down in my you know and it was just the grace of God that dad turned around and looked and saw me for going down the last time you know but sometimes in life that's the way we feel and and you know it's amazing that God isn't like our parents that or or us that we would forget or or maybe we got busy talking and we we forget where our child was amen and and uh God's not that way he he's he's been there all this time he's watching you understand what I'm saying he knows what you're saying he knows your tears that you're crying he he knows the agony he knows the the your your your heart is tore up he he knows the depths of your heart and you're crying out for him and it seems like he's not helping it seems like he's just sitting there but what he's trying to get us to do is to rely on him and understand that he's God and and so we have to be patient we have to be patient and waiting upon God as we walk with him now Hebrews 10:35 it says cast not away therefore your confidence cast not away your confidence when did you get that confidence when God saved you I believe that's when Abraham's confidence was is when God saved him it it's not that again it's not that you you go through the schooling before you decide say well I think he'll he'll make a he he's the best candidate for me I can put my TR trust in him no it's not that it's not that God has to campaign it's not that God has to sway you in one way or the other I I just believe that there's a predestinated seed there's a g Gene seed of God that when he passes over us and there's just something that responds I I don't know if that's the way it was with you but that's the way it was with me I didn't even know him but all I knew is I fell in love with him amen I I I didn't even know just how capable he was brother Bill I but but I knew that that I I just I I wanted to follow him we sing that song I Feel the pool well that's what it was when we come to him that's why brother Bram was against altar calls in in in the way that they used to do it you know that persuade them and they would say well you're you know your mama have been praying for you and you know and all all these things it once you come on up you know I've seen that so many times you know and then then they'd call them up and but it wasn't nothing see but but when we came to God God swept over us and he began to introduce himself to us and and we came to him willfully ain't that right and I I think that's when the confidence came but it doesn't stop us from the troubles and the trials and the agonies and and all of these things that we go through I think people do them and themselves an injustice when they don't build a relationship with God because the trials are going to come amen issues are going to come you cannot stop that I may go tomorrow and my children my wife will be left here alone and if they have not built their confidence in God if something has as arrested them despair is going to fall you understand what I'm saying it's easy to blame God it's easy to all of these things when you don't know him when you haven't built have that personal relationship with God it's easy to fall apart when we ain't got a a relationship with him I hope this makes sense to you amen see it it it it's got to come to a relationship so so Abraham began to walk with God not in knowledge not some preacher just constantly telling him about God and and what he should do and what he shouldn't do and all this this was God leading him and you can always tell a difference when someone's really got the Lord has really personally come to them in a special way and someone is just doing it through the motions and and the PR just constantly have to correct and someone's constantly having to remind them now you need to do this and you need to do that and you need to do this you know and and and but there's something there that brings them a conviction when you have a real walk with God there there's that just that personal thing keep coming follow me follow me come on I've got a place for you can you say man have you ever had that before I know you have there's just something there you start to settle down you you know maybe some enticements of the world and and and but there's something out in your heart said there's more there's more what is it that's God calling you personally come to me now you can't Cast Away your confidence a Christian walk has got a person to walk with God's got to have confidence in God true so cast not away therefore your confidence which hath great recompense of reward for you have need of patience that after you have done the will of God you might receive the promise you have need of patience that after you've done the will of God you've done everything that is required of you just like job did ain't that right he he he had offered the sacrifice what God had commanded what God had required he offered that atonement not only for himself but for his family right right and there was he went into the biggest trial of his life but he stood there with the patience never casting his away his confidence that's right Lord so he says for yet a little while he that will come uh for he that shall come will come and will not t now the just shall live by faith what are we to live by faith and if any man draw back my soul shall have no pleasure in him amen but we are not of them that draw back under predition but of them that believe to the saving of the Soul we live by faith can you say Amen faith in what faith in God's promised word yes sir amen God's word is the only thing that will never fail ain't that right so here in Romans 5:1 therefore being justified by faith we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ by whom also we have access by faith say that again being justified by faith justified by faith amen you've got to have that faith and you're believing on him ain't that right we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ by whom also we have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand and rejoice in Hope of theor glory of God not and not only so but we Glory everybody say we Glory we glory in tribulations also amen we are people that glory in Tribulation why because we we we're walking with him we've not Cast Away our confidence we know that he's going to take care of us we know that he's going to provide for us we know that he's going to answer and fulfill his word to us can you say Amen am see we we're we're we're not looking at all we've left the idols behind and now we're walking with God and we're looking only unto him who is our help amen glory and tribulations also knowing that tribulation worketh patience and patience experience Lord yes sir can I ask you have you waited long enough to have experience with God the lord it's in the tribulations that it's so easy to deny God it's so easy just to sit down and quit it's so easy just to give up it's so easy to start looking around at other things but when you with patience you're waiting and and and and and you're in that tribulation the tribulation Now is working patience and patience experience and experience hope why why would god promise something that we cannot do on our own I you know I was listening to the the message today I know and brother brandham he says now why do these wh why do we come to the these troubles why what makes these things come why should a Christian ever be perplexed and I want to say that to all of us why should we be perplexed why would not everything just run perfect for a Christian but it doesn't and we know it very true and you say Amen so God is not someone that just gives us full of promises just uh just to make us feel good nope he's there giving us promises but he also sends us through experiences that we have to wait sometimes we have to pray sometimes you understand what I'm saying we got to confess it sometimes and we don't see it we don't know when it's going to happen but we know it's going to happen because we have confidence in God Amen now he says see why doesn't everything just run perfect why would not everything just run perfect for a Christian but it does it and we know it sometimes we have more troubles everybody say we have more troubles sometimes we have more more troubles than a uh uh when we become a Christian than we did when we were sinners now think of that that's what a prophet is saying and he backs it up he says of course it is written many are the afflictions of the righteous not many are the afflictions of The Sinner many are the afflictions of the righteous ain't that right how many go through your afflictions we all go through our AFF afflictions trust you me we go through afflictions and and and and yet God deliver him from them all you've gone through your afflictions but God has delivered you through them all is that your testimony God has delivered us we could stand like David if it had not been for the Lord upon on our on our side the waters would have swallowed us up if it hadn't not been for the Lord on our side the enemy would have come in and devoured us if it had not been but even though God sends us through these things he Deliver us out of them all that's so he says now notice what he says God promised many afflictions strange feelings strange things that would be beyond our understanding but it's always done everybody say it's always done it's always done for our good ain't that right it's always done for your good see you're walking with God how me ever gone through a trial and when you got through the end of the trial you've come out of the trial you've known God better than what you did before you come in into it what is it you're walking with God come on it's always done for our good just can't understand it because if we did then it would not be Faith to us we would go with an understanding in other words we'd go through our trials with an understanding but sometimes we're going through our trials and not understanding why we're going through our trials but there's something in us that has a confidence in God the Lord amen see so he says but we do it and we have it and we believe by faith his word that it's going to work some good thing for us if we could just grasp that today see if we could grasp that uh all of our troubles and and there is none of us immune from them and if we could realize that those things are for our good now God gave that Abraham that promise in time didn't matter to Abraham the Bible says that he believed God and he counted God Faithful that promised and we know that God gave Abraham the son that he had promised him God fulfilled his word 25 years of waiting Abraham's body grew weaker amen but his faith grew stronger the Bible says he was strong in faith can you say Amen so it was just the B body that that was growing weaker but not the faith amen and I I I I think that's that's the difference you know if between someone that is is serving God by H knowledge and and just going through the going through the ritual of things and just going through religion and someone really having a personal walk with God that your faith gets stronger and stronger and stronger can you say Amen come on Church God doesn't keep us from our trials so that our faith stays strong you can go through the trials and your faith still gets stronger because you're learning about God you you're experiencing God every day should be an experience with God every trial should be an experience with God a personal relationship but we know that when that child got up Isaac got up to the age of 12 or whatever he was just a child as we read God told Abraham to take that child and offer him up and if you notice Abraham didn't question God he didn't sit there and say God why you see it was a test it was the final test for Abraham he had learned all that time of Walking with God through all of the things that he went through yes he had failed yes he had done that but in through everything God was faithful to him God never failed him and and so when it come to this final test amen and God requiring him to to to offer his son Abraham was so confident so full of trust God never told him that that oh this is just going to be I'm just kidding you just go ahead and go through the act and you know it ain't going to really be no as far as Abraham con was concerned he was going to offer for that son to God but he knew that God could raise him up that's just the confidence that Abraham had he didn't go to to some he he didn't say sir it's about time we go back I'm just tired of all this no he his faith was strong in God so much so that when he got to the the bottom of the mountain and they left the servants there he says me and the lad will return amen me and the lad will return I like is that your faith is that your confidence we're going to go through this thing God's going to provide can you say amen and I think that's as as Abraham as Abraham was and God had revealed that part to him so is it God revealing to us and I understand that God has already provided a sacrifice for us but you see in every aspect of Our Lives there's an element of of Supernatural that is required for these promises to come to pass do you believe that it's it's it's even it it's even not just just simply hearing the message preached it's simply not just going through the actions of going to church and day in and day out and hearing the preacher preach there has to be a supernatural element to this that God provides himself he quickens it to us he he's the one that gives us the faith he's the one that that quickens the word to us and and and as as we're walking with him trust me there's a change that is taking place and and it comes from God providing do you believe it amen amen if we didn't have the spirit of God in our lives whatsoever and we just relied upon head knowledge we would learn more about God more about the message more about the Bible and the and these things we could even get it to where we could put quotes and all these things together and yet it would all be a carnal understanding and there would be nothing quickened to us now Church why does God send the message to us why does God do these things why has has he done it to build us up church as the prophet said there's going to it's going to take more faith than ever before in this age do you believe that amen it's going to take more faith and church we we can't look at the natural things for our substance yeah I get it we got to work we got to do these things we got to live it takes money it takes these things but when Trouble Comes our way way when our back is against the wall when when the money ain't coming in or maybe laid off of the job or maybe the child is sick or maybe we've gotten received bad news uh uh uh and and we just don't know what to do and and naturally we would just cave in we would fall apart but God by Grace he has been working something in our lives that's been building a faith Within us that has caused us to turn from the world turn from the idols turn from the things that the world looks to for help and we're walking with God keeping our eyes upon God Amen and God requires things from us that we just don't understand and and and and and he puts things in our lives or he brings us in the path that we just don't understand but we wait upon God I think that's where we've got to pray church I think people lack prayer in their lives so much amen can you say Amen we go through our day and I'm I'm I'm guilty just as much but we can go through our day without praying but I'm telling you church God wants a relationship with us amen hello amen amen you know God doesn't want us to come 15 20 25 years into the gospel and then we're still being blowed by our trials and we're just Teeter tottering and we're just so disappointed and so let down and so whiny and so this and so that we should be at a place that we just have this confidence in God he's going to work it out out because we could look back and we've gone through experiences not just experiencing trials but we've experienced God in that trial we we have actually experienced a a personal relationship with God to where we have seen God in every trial work things out we've seen God meet the need we've seen God answer the prayer we've seen God heal the sick we've seen God Deliver us so many times that our faith should be strong in God can you say Amen will again amen you love him amen amen if the musicians will come walk with God looking unto Jesus amen not just knowing about his word but knowing the author of the word that's the point yes sir I think it interesting that the man that was criticizing brother brandham you know he's trying to belittle brother brandham yeah you don't know your Bible they criticized him for his grammar that he doesn't say things right doesn't present his message right doesn't present things right you just don't know the Bible but brother Brown says but I know the author and I promise you none of them guys hardly ever did yes sir I'm sure they know a little bit maybe some but a lot of them depended upon their knowledge of this Bible But Here Come A man that had an understanding of who God was he knew the author he kept in relationship and it wasn't just a prophet you know you don't have to have an angel visit you you don't have to have Jesus Christ to stand in front of you you don't have to have these Supernatural visitations all the time just walk with God trust God pray seek him can you say amen amen read his Bible read the Bible listen to the message but remember when you're doing this God's going to bring you through things so that you can understand what he's talking about here if he says I'm the god that Health thee then you know good and well he's going to bring you through a a time to where you're going to need a Healer but don't fall apart you know he's not going to leave you he ain't going to forsake you don't Cast Away your confidence when troubles come and everything just goes Haywire just stand there in confidence and that's where the relationship with God comes in can you say amen amen what on they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their string they shall Mount [Music] up and not be weary they shall walk [Music] and not faint teach me Lord teach me Lord can we go up a key all they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength they shall Mount up with wings as the eagle oh they shall run and not be weary Oh They'll walk and not faint teach me Lord teach me Lord hallelujah sing it again oh they that way [Music]

what you want to do is wait upon the Lord wait patiently not complain not cry not but just with joy waiting on the promise with confidence waiting knowing that God's got this he's brought you through this trial to to reveal himself to you oh that we could get our eyes off the other Idols of this world hallelujah hallelujah I I truly believe the more that Abraham knew God and and understood God all them other Idols just faded out of the way Hallelujah we should never compare God to any other things oh so many people are guilty of that when God doesn't move they they turn around and look into other things for convenience and for satisfaction for Joy for help for for all kinds of things it just shows that the relationship just ain't there oh May that relationship come to us may we have him and know him I tell you what there's no God liking there there's no provider like him there's no joy that can be given like he gives there's no peace there's no Comfort there's no nothing at any any any anything that this world has to offer they can't give it like God hallelujah teach me Lord teach me Lord to sing it now oh they that way remember Abraham when he had the choice they had to separate from lot Abra Abraham actually gave lot first choice because he was so in comfort and so trusting God to take care of [Music] him it was Lot he didn't have a walk with God he he didn't have that personal relationship he began to look at the plains of Sodom and Gomorrah everything that he felt that that that could Supply his needs was there but Abraham he could sat out in that tent and Sarah being a law to her husband sitting out in that old dried desert and all these things and nothing really going for him in life if you could say it that way but oh he had a promise and it was at that time that mzc showed up amen amen amen oh teach me Lord Teach Me Lord to PR there's that little song God can do it again and again and again he's the same God today as he all always has been
