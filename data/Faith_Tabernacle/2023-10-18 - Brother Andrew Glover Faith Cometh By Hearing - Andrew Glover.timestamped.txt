[42:26] name of the Lord Jesus and my isn't it
[42:28] good to be a Christian Amen to be saved
[42:30] and to be following the word of the hour
[42:32] I was just thinking today if we didn't
[42:34] have this message where would we be what
[42:36] hope would we have amen but with this
[42:39] message we have hope and we have a
[42:40] direction and we do want to just thank

[42:50] sure been listening in and staying
[42:52] connected and my I sure appreciate our
[42:54] pastor and the word he's been bringing
[42:55] in the ministry here and amen just
[42:58] feeding us the message of the hour amen
[43:00] and I believe that's what it's going to
[43:01] take sister Jane to get us out of here
[43:03] one of these mornings amen is the word
[43:05] that we're hearing and as those of you
[43:07] know we were actually supposed to be
[43:08] leaving yesterday for New Zealand and
[43:10] Australia for about two weeks and we
[43:12] actually was on our way to the airport
[43:14] when we got the word that sister Eric
[43:16] had passed and just didn't feel in our
[43:18] heart to leave the country at this time
[43:20] to be able to be there for the funeral
[43:22] this weekend and so I know the church
[43:24] there and brother Donnie desires your
[43:25] prayers and amen I I was just reading
[43:28] today the prophet of God talking about
[43:29] in the spoken words Original Seed he
[43:31] said we're going to go out of this orbit
[43:33] someday and he said we're going to go
[43:34] over in that land where there's no
[43:36] Sorrows or sin or sickness or death and
[43:38] I thought Lord even so come Lord Jesus
[43:41] amen there's a place we can go and so
[43:43] tonight if you have your Bibles we want
[43:44] to go to the word of the Lord to the
[43:46] Book of Romans the 10th chapter The Book
[43:49] of Romans the 10th chapter then we're
[43:51] also going to read from the book of
[43:52] Revelation the 10th chapter but just a
[43:55] few things here tonight to speak to you
[43:57] from our heart and some things on our
[43:58] heart that we've been studying and um
[44:01] just some inspiration I picked up I just
[44:02] share a few things with you from it and
[44:04] pray it'll be a a blessing to you it's
[44:06] nothing you haven't heard but just some
[44:08] things that's becoming real to me and I
[44:11] believe if there's ever been an hour
[44:12] that we need faith I believe now is the
[44:14] hour amen amen The Book of Romans the
[44:16] 10th chapter and the 11th verse um and
[44:20] just before we read the word let's just
[44:22] ask the Lord to come and and bless the
[44:24] word tonight Heavenly Father Lord As We
[44:26] Gather here on this Wednesday evening
[44:28] father I know Lord there may just be a
[44:30] few of us here tonight Lord but that
[44:32] doesn't change your power Lord that
[44:35] doesn't change the atmosphere Lord as I
[44:37] step behind this pull pit tonight father
[44:39] I feel a an atmosphere of electricity
[44:42] Lord of Believers father of Faith oh God
[44:45] lord to know that they're going through
[44:47] things and situations and and problems
[44:49] but Lord there's something in our heart
[44:51] to push our way past all of those things
[44:53] to be in your presence and Lord I pray
[44:56] tonight as we Endeavor to look into your
[44:58] word I ask that you would send the
[44:59] spirit of Revelation into the building
[45:02] tonight God that inspiration could come
[45:04] up on your word father your word is
[45:06] already anointed so tonight Lord we're
[45:08] asking you to anoint our faith in your
[45:10] anointed word that we could receive
[45:12] something Lord that would Lord encourage
[45:14] us that would edify us Lord if it would
[45:16] correct us that we would be able to be
[45:18] corrected father whatever Lord that you
[45:21] have on your heart to give your children
[45:22] tonight we surrender our vessel to you
[45:25] and Lord I pray that as we surrender to
[45:27] speak your word May the Believers father
[45:29] surrender to hear your word and to
[45:31] receive your word and Lord when we would
[45:33] leave this place may we be able to say
[45:35] did not our hearts burn within us as you
[45:37] came and talk to us along the way and
[45:40] we'll be sure to give you all the praise
[45:42] all the honor and all the glory in the
[45:44] wonderful name of our Lord and Savior
[45:46] Jesus Christ we pray and all the
[45:49] Believers
[45:50] says amen and amen Romans the 10th
[45:54] chapter and then the 11th verse Paul
[45:57] here says for the scripture saith
[45:59] whosoever believeth on him shall not be
[46:03] ashamed for there is no difference
[46:05] between the Jew and the Greek for the
[46:07] same Lord over all is Rich unto all that
[46:10] call upon him for whosoever shall call
[46:13] upon the name of the Lord shall be saved
[46:16] I love that promise don't you how then
[46:19] shall they call on him in whom they've
[46:21] not believed and how shall they believe
[46:23] in him of whom they've not heard heard
[46:26] and how shall they hear without a
[46:28] preacher now watch this and how shall
[46:30] they preach except they be sent as it is
[46:33] written how beautiful are the feet of
[46:36] them that preach the gospel of peace and
[46:38] bring Glad Tidings of good things but
[46:41] they have not all obeyed the gospel for
[46:44] Isaiah saith Lord who hath believed I
[46:47] report now you know he's actually
[46:49] referring to Isaiah 53 where he says who
[46:51] hath believed our report and brother
[46:53] Bram answers that question with a
[46:55] question and says and to whom is the arm
[46:57] of the Lord revealed so in other words
[46:59] if you believe the report of the Lord
[47:01] then the arm of the Lord has been
[47:02] revealed to you which is his power so
[47:05] who has believed our report and can we
[47:07] say it like this to whom is the arm of
[47:09] the Lord revealed so now watch this so
[47:12] then Faith cometh by hearing and hearing
[47:15] by the word of God Amen Faith cometh by
[47:19] hearing and hearing by the word of God
[47:21] now in the Book of Revelation the 10th
[47:24] chapter I know that we could uh read
[47:26] this verse by heart but amen it's just a
[47:29] it's a special verse to the Believers in
[47:30] Revelation 10 and verse 7 uh the Bible
[47:34] here
[47:35] says speaking of this uh Faith cometh by
[47:39] hearing Revelation 10:7 he says but in
[47:41] the days of the voice of the seventh
[47:44] angel when he shall begin to sound so
[47:47] he's going to begin to sound the mystery
[47:49] of God should be finished as Heath
[47:52] declared to his servants the prophets I
[47:54] believe if he's is going to sound
[47:56] somebody is going to hear that sound
[47:59] amen you believe that this evening we
[48:00] ask the Lord this evening to bless his
[48:02] word as you can have your seats here
[48:04] this afternoon I want to by the help of
[48:06] the Lord for just a few moments to speak
[48:08] to you tonight and if I would title this
[48:10] I want to speak to you on faith cometh
[48:12] by hearing amen Faith cometh by hearing
[48:15] 1954 brother BR preaches an entire
[48:17] sermon and he calls it amen Faith cometh
[48:20] by hearing so I'm actually just
[48:21] borrowing his title amen that Faith
[48:24] cometh by hearing brother BR said there
[48:26] just to read a few quotes here from that
[48:27] sermon he said paragraph 25 he said I'd
[48:30] like to speak just a moment to you on
[48:32] faith cometh by hearing he said and I
[48:34] love this word and the word of faith
[48:37] another place he said in paragraph 30 he
[48:39] said now how do we get Faith amen Faith
[48:41] cometh by hearing hearing what the word
[48:44] of God now that's right you cannot base
[48:46] it on nothing else but the word of God
[48:48] now you just cannot have faith and just
[48:51] say oh well if you go over here and
[48:52] touch that it'll make you well or if you
[48:54] touch the radio or touch this that the
[48:56] other he said no I can't go for that
[48:58] I've got to have something that's strong
[49:00] amen and the strongest thing I know of
[49:03] is the word of God Amen the strongest
[49:07] thing that I know of is the word of God
[49:09] in another place you said Faith first
[49:11] has to be based Amen on the word and the
[49:13] word of God produces Faith so faith
[49:16] based on the word and the word of God
[49:18] produces Faith now if God said so he
[49:21] said then I would believe it and I would
[49:23] believe it with all of my heart
[49:25] paragraph 39 he said Faith cometh by
[49:27] what then now the he's been preaching
[49:29] this for a while so now the
[49:30] congregation's catching on and the
[49:32] congregation says hearing he says
[49:34] hearing the what amen the word of the
[49:37] Lord see the word of God settles and
[49:39] Abraham believed God by faith amen
[49:41] because God's word said so he never
[49:43] reasoned he never questioned he just
[49:46] believed God's word is that right he
[49:48] said well that's the same way that we
[49:50] get Faith tonight is believing God's
[49:53] word so the same way that Abraham got
[49:55] got faith brother bah is the same way
[49:57] that we get Faith and that's by
[49:59] believing God's word amen and I believe
[50:02] that we're believing God's word which is
[50:04] the word of faith I believe we're also
[50:06] preaching God's word that is the word of
[50:08] faith now Romans 10:8 says what saith it
[50:11] amen the word is nigh thee even in thy
[50:14] mouth and in thy heart amen that is the
[50:17] word of faith that we preach so it's not
[50:20] something you're hearing just on the on
[50:22] a billboard or reading on a book but
[50:24] it's actually something amen that God
[50:26] has commissioned the ministry of this
[50:28] age to preach amen is the word of faith
[50:31] Brother's first sermon recorded on tap
[50:32] faith is a substance he said I wish to
[50:34] speak to you tonight and just take a
[50:36] little bit of time and teach the word of
[50:38] faith amen that you might know how to
[50:40] approach God because there's many of
[50:42] these great deep subjects that people
[50:44] claim they know much about but when it
[50:46] comes down to the final showdown amen
[50:49] they know very little of it so here a
[50:51] prophet is basing the entire message
[50:53] Amen on teaching the word of faith
[50:55] that's going to bring an understanding
[50:57] Amen to the people to approach God I
[50:59] believe amen that our prayer should be
[51:01] like the apostles in Luke 17 when they
[51:04] said Lord increase our faith they were
[51:06] actually asking God Amen not to increase
[51:09] their Ministries or to increase their
[51:10] capacity amen but they were asking God
[51:13] to increase their faith amen because our
[51:15] motive and objective amen is to get the
[51:18] faith of God in the heart of God's
[51:20] people because the prophet said like
[51:23] this he said so he said I ask thee kind
[51:25] father if you'll move back every Shadow
[51:26] of Doubt amen move back all the spirits
[51:29] of opposition so that the Holy Spirit
[51:31] can take the heart of the person tonight
[51:34] and let them see the resurrection of our
[51:36] Lord Jesus Christ so you're not going to
[51:38] see amen his resurrection just by your
[51:41] eyes or see it amen just by or hear it
[51:43] by your ears but you're going to see it
[51:45] amen by the faith of God in your heart
[51:48] now when you start talking about faith
[51:49] you all know that faith is a very vast
[51:51] subject it's a very broad subject amen
[51:54] and there's no way that in one service
[51:56] you could even begin to cover amen what
[51:58] faith is there's so many angles amen
[52:00] that we can approach Faith from and I'll
[52:02] say the reason why it's such a vast
[52:04] subject amen is because the prophet said
[52:06] that God is known by faith so your
[52:08] introduction to God Amen is by faith he
[52:11] said God is not known by theology he's
[52:13] not known by education God is known by
[52:16] faith amen knowledge takes a man away
[52:19] from God Amen but Faith brings him to
[52:22] God faith brings a man to God he said
[52:25] that's what was separated man from God
[52:26] In the Garden of Eden amen is he went to
[52:29] the tree of knowledge so there were two
[52:30] trees there was a tree of life amen then
[52:33] there was the tree of knowledge of Good
[52:34] and Evil amen and as long as man was
[52:37] feeding from the Tree of Life he was
[52:38] close to God Amen but the minute he left
[52:41] the tree of life and went to the tree of
[52:43] knowledge amen he separated himself from
[52:46] God Amen so knowledge moves you from God
[52:48] Amen but Faith moves you to God Amen I
[52:51] believe that faith has a power behind it
[52:53] I believe amen that faith fath has the
[52:55] power to bring forth do you believe that
[52:58] brother said I like to read the word
[52:59] it's an inspiration because the Bible
[53:02] said that Faith cometh by hearing and
[53:03] hearing of the word of God he said
[53:05] that's true amen then when we hear the
[53:08] word of God then Faith brings forth so
[53:10] when you hear the word amen that's
[53:12] bringing faith into your heart and as
[53:14] you're hearing that word it's bringing a
[53:16] strength to bring forth the promise of
[53:18] the word that you're hearing another
[53:20] place he said thanks be to our Lord
[53:22] Jesus Christ who brought again the
[53:24] spirit of God and the resurrected Christ
[53:26] who is present tonight to heal all that
[53:29] is in need amen he is here friends he
[53:32] said I have no way of bringing him to
[53:34] you amen only your faith brings him
[53:38] present amen your faith brings him
[53:42] present now amen I know tonight is a
[53:44] Wednesday night service but I just
[53:45] happen to be one that does not believe
[53:48] amen that there's Wednesday expectations
[53:50] and Sunday expectations or or meeting
[53:52] expectation I believe as believers amen
[53:55] every service we ought to have the same
[53:57] expectation amen because every service
[54:00] the same God the same message the same
[54:02] anointing the same power is being
[54:05] preached amen from the word of faith
[54:07] brother B says it very beautiful he said
[54:09] if you come expecting to get help from
[54:11] God Amen then God will meet your
[54:13] expectancy he always does whenever you
[54:16] go whatever you do whatever you expect
[54:18] amen brings your faith if you come
[54:20] saying well there's nothing to it that's
[54:22] just the way you're going to back go
[54:24] back home with nothing to it if you come
[54:26] tonight saying well if I don't get
[54:27] prayed for I'll go home and I won't be
[54:29] healed that's just the way you'll go
[54:31] amen but if you come here tonight saying
[54:34] I come for one sole purpose and that is
[54:36] to contact Christ for my body or my soul
[54:39] amen you'll go home just as happy as you
[54:42] can be amen for you will contact him no
[54:45] matter what the opposition looks like
[54:47] Christ is the answer amen no matter what
[54:50] kind of day you've had Christ is the
[54:52] answer no matter what this week is held
[54:55] or tomorrow holds amen or the next month
[54:57] holds Christ is the answer amen I love
[55:00] what the prophet says faith brings
[55:02] Christ how many agree amen that Faith
[55:05] brings Christ he said notice could you
[55:07] imagine 80y old Simeon white beard white
[55:09] hair amen yet the old man went around
[55:12] telling people that he was not going to
[55:14] die until he had seen the Lord's Christ
[55:16] he said what a beautiful picture of
[55:18] Faith now can I give you some things on
[55:20] faith amen one place he said here amen
[55:23] that Faith knows no defeat
[55:25] amen Faith knows no defeat he said faith
[55:28] is perfect amen Faith brings things when
[55:31] there's no things to be brought amen
[55:33] Faith creates amen Faith takes away the
[55:36] doubt takes away the negative amen and
[55:39] makes it positive so faith has the power
[55:41] to create it has the power to defeat it
[55:44] has the power to call things that are
[55:46] not as though they are and things that
[55:48] are as though they are not amen see how
[55:51] beautiful faith is amen and Simeon had a
[55:53] basis for faith listen what a prophet
[55:56] said faith is not mythical amen
[55:58] something mentally worked up amen it's
[56:00] an absolutely fundamental result amen
[56:03] that happens in a person's heart amen
[56:06] then what did the prophet say he said
[56:08] move away all the shadows of Doubt amen
[56:10] and all the opposition so that the
[56:13] people amen can see God and the power of
[56:15] his resurrection listen friends I don't
[56:17] believe that our faith is something amen
[56:19] that gets right when the music gets
[56:21] right amen I don't believe our faith is
[56:23] something that gets right amen when the
[56:25] service gets right amen I believe as
[56:27] Sons and Daughters of God we come here
[56:29] tonight amen with faith in our hearts
[56:32] amen it's not mythical it's not
[56:34] imaginary it's not something that's got
[56:36] to be worked up amen the only thing
[56:38] faith has got to be done is be released
[56:40] and when faith is released it can create
[56:43] When Faith is released it can take the
[56:45] negative and turn it positive When Faith
[56:47] is released amen it can call things that
[56:49] are not as though they are amen When
[56:51] Faith drops in a person's heart and it
[56:53] is appropriated it is something in the
[56:56] person's heart amen but it cannot be
[56:58] based upon well go touch a tree and
[57:00] you'll get welled or go touch this or
[57:02] pray the PO amen it's got to have a
[57:06] foundation faith has got to have a
[57:10] foundation amen another place I said
[57:12] like a prophet said amen faith has no
[57:14] hindrances he said men of all ages that
[57:17] has faith in what they're trying to
[57:18] achieve has been persistent amen now you
[57:21] have to be persistent you cannot just
[57:23] sit back and say well I see what Joe
[57:25] does about it you cannot do that amen
[57:28] before you can be persistent you have to
[57:30] have faith in what you're trying to
[57:32] achieve and if you haven't got the faith
[57:34] then you'll not be persistent Amen to be
[57:37] persistent first is to have faith and
[57:39] then you've got to know what source
[57:41] you're drawing your faith from amen
[57:44] that's why the prophet took time Amen to
[57:46] separate amen a point of contact from a
[57:50] stimulation of Faith amen and Faith
[57:52] itself amen they were touching post
[57:54] brother Heaven they were touching trees
[57:56] and that's why or Roberts had them
[57:57] touching radios amen and brother B said
[58:00] the faith is not coming from the radio
[58:02] the faith is not coming from the
[58:03] television the faith is coming from the
[58:06] word the only thing that is is a point
[58:08] of contact Amen to stimulate the faith
[58:11] that's in you listen friends if you're
[58:13] going to have faith you've got to know
[58:16] what source you are drawing your faith
[58:18] from let me say this what you're wanting
[58:21] amen has got to be in what you're
[58:23] drawing from amen what you're Desiring
[58:26] has first got to be in what you're
[58:28] trying to get it out of Amen let me say
[58:30] like the prophet said amen you cannot
[58:32] get blood from a turnip amen because it
[58:34] hasn't got any blood in it amen so
[58:36] that's the way it is you cannot get
[58:39] Faith from something amen that there's
[58:41] nothing to get Faith out of that's why
[58:43] the ministry is screaming if you're
[58:45] going to hear anything hear this message
[58:48] if you're going to see anything see this
[58:50] message if you're going to believe
[58:51] anything or preachers if you're going to
[58:53] preach anything preach preach this
[58:55] message amen it's the only thing that's
[58:57] got God's faith in it because it didn't
[58:59] come from a school and it didn't come
[59:01] from a seminary but it came from the
[59:03] pages of the Bible amen and it's more
[59:06] than just a sermon it's more than just a
[59:08] song it is an anointing of faith that is
[59:11] dropped down upon the church to manifest
[59:13] every promise that God's word is spoken
[59:15] of amen that's exactly right amen so it
[59:18] has to be God in here first to make
[59:21] Faith amen if you're going to get Faith
[59:24] God got to be in there to make the faith
[59:26] you're Desiring to
[59:28] get that's a powerful thing if you're
[59:30] thirsty amen sister sister Jane if
[59:32] you're thirsty you don't go to a rock
[59:34] unless you're Israel amen if you're
[59:36] hungry you don't go to the Wilderness
[59:38] unless you're Israel amen and the reason
[59:40] they got water out of the Rock Amen is
[59:42] there was a God in there to create the
[59:44] water and the reason they got Mana out
[59:45] of the Wilderness is because there was a
[59:47] God to rain it down and the reason
[59:49] there's a people here receiving faith
[59:51] for a Rapture is because God has sent
[59:54] them message and in that message is full
[59:56] of rapturing Faith that's why we're not
[59:59] drawing from TD Jakes we're not drawing
[1:00:01] from Billy Graham there's nothing in
[1:00:03] there to draw faith for a Rapture out of
[1:00:06] Amen but in the days of the voice of the
[1:00:08] seventh angel when he shall begin to
[1:00:11] sound amen faith will come by hearing
[1:00:14] and hearing by the voice of the seventh
[1:00:16] Angel's message listen I'll say this God
[1:00:18] is in this message and God was in his
[1:00:21] messenger amen how many agree God was in
[1:00:23] his messenger if God was in his
[1:00:25] messenger he's in his message amen and
[1:00:27] I'll tell you what this message is to
[1:00:29] the believer it's the word of God and
[1:00:31] John said in the beginning was the word
[1:00:33] and the Word was with God and the Word
[1:00:35] was God and the same was in the
[1:00:37] beginning with God and all things were
[1:00:39] made by him and without him was not
[1:00:42] anything made that was made listen here
[1:00:44] in John 1:14 and the Word was made flesh
[1:00:48] amen so in the beginning was the
[1:00:51] word and the source of faith is the word
[1:00:55] Faith Cometh From hearing the word so in
[1:00:59] the beginning was the word amen and The
[1:01:01] Well of Faith was invisible it was God
[1:01:04] the spirit but there was faith in him
[1:01:07] but watch in John 1:14 and the Word was
[1:01:10] made flesh and dwelt Among Us amen so
[1:01:12] the Fountain of Faith amen moved from
[1:01:15] the invisible to the visible amen all
[1:01:18] that was in God he poured into Christ
[1:01:21] and all that was in Christ he poured
[1:01:23] into the church amen then the Fountain
[1:01:25] of Faith amen moved from God in spirit
[1:01:28] form into flesh form Amen in Jesus
[1:01:32] Christ and dwelt among us and we beheld
[1:01:34] his glory amen the glory as of the only
[1:01:37] begotten full of the father amen full of
[1:01:39] grace and truth amen now listen what a
[1:01:41] prophet said then when this Greek woman
[1:01:43] heard of Jesus Faith cometh by hearing
[1:01:46] amen she was a Greek a heathen amen so
[1:01:48] she heard and she come you know what
[1:01:51] faith finds a source amen that others do
[1:01:53] not see
[1:01:54] amen Faith finds a source that others
[1:01:57] cannot see amen that's why the prophet
[1:01:59] of God As I said was separating amen a
[1:02:02] point of contact for Faith amen from the
[1:02:05] source of Faith amen that radio was not
[1:02:08] the word that television was not the
[1:02:10] word that pole was not the word amen but
[1:02:13] the god of heavens and earth is the word
[1:02:16] and he is the source of faith and the
[1:02:18] prophet said like this he said not touch
[1:02:20] a pole touch something else or a totem
[1:02:22] pole or some man or some woman I believe
[1:02:25] Amen in Touching God through believing
[1:02:27] his word through faith then when you do
[1:02:30] that amen that word becomes in you a
[1:02:33] life amen a germatize word and every one
[1:02:36] of God's words is gerti then the only
[1:02:38] thing you take a handful of Wheat and
[1:02:41] hold it here on the platform it'll never
[1:02:43] make anything there it's got to be in
[1:02:45] the ground not only grounded but in the
[1:02:47] right kind of ground to support it and
[1:02:49] if the good word of God Falls in poor
[1:02:51] ground it'll bring a poor crop you take
[1:02:54] take a good grain put it in good ground
[1:02:56] in the right condition to bring forth a
[1:02:57] h hundredfold so is the word of God when
[1:03:00] it's brought into the human heart amen
[1:03:03] with a faith undying faith in the Lord
[1:03:06] Jesus Christ with the Holy Spirit and
[1:03:08] the power of God is there to water it
[1:03:10] it'll germatize and bring forth
[1:03:13] everything it said it would do amen it's
[1:03:15] a word it's the word of God listen
[1:03:17] friends this word amen falling in that
[1:03:19] Pew is not going to produce a body
[1:03:21] change this word falling in that chair
[1:03:24] is not going to produce a root CH come
[1:03:26] on church I'm preaching the word of
[1:03:28] faith through this microphone amen but
[1:03:30] this microphone is not going to take a
[1:03:32] change amen but the one holding this
[1:03:34] microphone is going to take a change
[1:03:37] amen because there's an undying faith in
[1:03:39] my heart amen and this message is
[1:03:42] anointing my faith to believe that God
[1:03:44] is able to take an old body and make it
[1:03:47] young again this word is anointing my
[1:03:49] faith to believe that the dead are going
[1:03:51] to raise Incorruptible this word is
[1:03:53] anointing in my faith to believe that
[1:03:56] some morning our loved ones are going to
[1:03:58] appear behind this church amen what is
[1:04:00] it amen the word falling into a heart
[1:04:03] that's ordained to bring forth the
[1:04:05] promise of the word that's falling into
[1:04:08] it amen the word is falling in those
[1:04:10] pews but those pews ain't going to take
[1:04:12] a change amen those pews are not going
[1:04:14] to bring forth a body change but there's
[1:04:16] some people on them pews well come on
[1:04:19] Church there's some people on them pews
[1:04:21] that's been taking this word in for
[1:04:23] years and some morning their body is
[1:04:26] going to obey the word they're hearing
[1:04:28] amen when you think of this spiritual
[1:04:29] hearing the Bible speaks of it the Bible
[1:04:32] actually speaks of the spiritual hearing
[1:04:34] of Believers in Proverbs 8:34 the Bible
[1:04:37] said blessed is the man that heareth me
[1:04:39] amen watching daily at my Gates amen
[1:04:42] waiting at the post of my doors Proverbs
[1:04:45] 15:31 the ear that heareth the reproof
[1:04:48] of life amen abideth among the wise in
[1:04:51] Ecclesiastes 5:1 amen keep thy foot when
[1:04:55] thou goest to the house of God and be
[1:04:57] more ready to hear than to give
[1:05:00] sacrifice of fools for they consider not
[1:05:03] that they do evil in James 1:19 he said
[1:05:06] wherefore my beloved Brethren let every
[1:05:08] man be swift to hear he me and slow to
[1:05:11] speak and slow to wrath brother Amos I
[1:05:13] can't read that verse without thinking
[1:05:15] about my old high school teacher she
[1:05:17] used to say it like this at the
[1:05:18] Christian School she'd say the Bible
[1:05:20] says be swift to hear and slow to speak
[1:05:22] she said you know why cuz you got two
[1:05:24] ears and one mouth you're supposed to do
[1:05:26] more hearing than you are talking good
[1:05:28] free of charge amen let every man be
[1:05:31] swift to hear and slow to speak amen now
[1:05:34] you all realize tonight the Bible says
[1:05:36] amen that the word would be spoken by
[1:05:38] the prophets in Amos three the Bible
[1:05:40] says the word of the Lord amen comes to
[1:05:43] the prophet now listen what a prophet
[1:05:45] says in the spoken word is the Original
[1:05:46] Seed he said my mission I believe to the
[1:05:49] Earth is what amen is to forerun the
[1:05:52] coming word amen my mission to the Earth
[1:05:55] is to forun the coming word see the
[1:05:58] coming word which is Christ amen and
[1:06:01] Christ in him has the Millennium and has
[1:06:04] everything right there amen because he
[1:06:07] is the word amen who is this speaking
[1:06:10] who is this this is the messenger of
[1:06:12] Revelation 10:7 in the days of the voice
[1:06:15] of the seventh angel when he shall begin
[1:06:17] to sound and here he is saying my
[1:06:20] mission to the Earth amen is to forun
[1:06:23] the coming word
[1:06:24] amen and that word is Christ and in him
[1:06:27] is the Millennium and in him is
[1:06:29] everything we have need of Amen because
[1:06:31] he is the word then Paul said Faith
[1:06:34] cometh by hearing amen and hearing by
[1:06:36] the word then can I say this to you amen
[1:06:39] your rapture is going to come by the
[1:06:40] word your body change is going to come
[1:06:43] by the word your healing is going to
[1:06:45] come by the word your Victory is going
[1:06:47] to come by the word your deliverance is
[1:06:49] going to come by the word joy and peace
[1:06:52] and happiness amen and satisfaction is
[1:06:55] going to come by the word because the
[1:06:57] word is a word of faith and it's the
[1:06:59] Christ of the Bible speaking to the
[1:07:02] church amen now I love this when a
[1:07:04] prophet says this he's in front of
[1:07:05] something and there's something coming
[1:07:07] behind him amen there's something that
[1:07:10] he's forerunning there's something he's
[1:07:11] announcing and whatever he's announcing
[1:07:14] he's going to turn the attention of the
[1:07:16] church to what he is sent to forrun and
[1:07:19] what he sent to forrun is the
[1:07:22] Bible the word which is the source of
[1:07:25] Faith which is Christ remember said
[1:07:27] there and spoke the words Original Seed
[1:07:29] he said there's been three seeds sown
[1:07:31] there's been a denominational seed
[1:07:32] there's been a Pentecostal seed he said
[1:07:35] then there'll be the word seed he said
[1:07:37] and the word seed will be sown amen by
[1:07:40] the messenger of Malachi 4 Listen
[1:07:42] brother Shi he says he will seow the
[1:07:44] entire word seed Bible in the church
[1:07:48] amen then whatever he was forerunning
[1:07:50] was not a partial word it was not a
[1:07:52] partial restoration it was the entire
[1:07:55] word seed of the Bible was going to be
[1:07:58] swn into the church now in that message
[1:08:00] he says he goes to the book of Luke's
[1:08:02] 8th chapter let's just read that Luke's
[1:08:04] 8th chapter and the fourth verse amen
[1:08:06] it's a very powerful reading in Luke 8
[1:08:08] verse4 the Bible said that when much
[1:08:11] people gathered together amen they were
[1:08:13] come out of every city amen and he spake
[1:08:16] by a parable now you all know what a
[1:08:17] parable is it's a Earthly story with a
[1:08:19] Heavenly meaning amen he spake by a
[1:08:22] parable and he said a soul went out to
[1:08:24] seow his seed somebody say his seed a
[1:08:27] swer went out to seow his seed and as he
[1:08:30] sowed amen some fell by the wayside I
[1:08:33] want you to notice something here amen
[1:08:35] there's four different types of ground
[1:08:38] amen the first one is amen the Wayside
[1:08:40] ground and it was trotten down and the
[1:08:43] fouls of the air devoured it in verse
[1:08:45] number six amen some brother amus fell
[1:08:48] Upon A Rock Amen and as soon as it was
[1:08:50] sprung up it withered away because it
[1:08:54] lack moisture stops and says moisture
[1:08:57] Baptist Presbyterian Lutheran without
[1:08:58] water and when he's first converted he
[1:09:01] looks right straight to Christ and he
[1:09:03] believes but then the first thing you
[1:09:05] know that denomination binds him up into
[1:09:07] a place and the moisture of the spirit
[1:09:10] is gone from him he becomes
[1:09:12] denominational and he's dead now watch
[1:09:15] this some fell among the rocks and some
[1:09:17] fell among the Thorns amen and the
[1:09:19] Thorns sprang up with it and choked it
[1:09:22] out now watch this just what I thank the
[1:09:24] Christian businessmen and the rest of
[1:09:26] them Pentecostal organizations these
[1:09:28] people that's building all these big
[1:09:29] millions of dollars of things he said
[1:09:31] the riches of the world Amen has choked
[1:09:34] out the glory and the spirit of God Amen
[1:09:37] and they are dying because it's choked
[1:09:39] amen so not only are they lacking
[1:09:41] moisture but now brother Bill the very
[1:09:43] life of the word is being choked out
[1:09:45] amen because the things that are coming
[1:09:47] in the church are choking the life out
[1:09:50] it's the world the cares of the world
[1:09:52] Amen it's choked them out he said the
[1:09:54] women wants to be active and Bob off
[1:09:55] their hair and have Waterhead haircuts
[1:09:58] and wear shorts and look like the rest
[1:09:59] of the world Amen the preacher stands up
[1:10:01] in the pull pit amen and they practice
[1:10:03] their amens and Afraid of the word of
[1:10:05] God Amen because of a meal ticket if
[1:10:08] they cannot ride a Cadillac they're not
[1:10:10] even considered spiritual anymore that's
[1:10:12] right if they can't dress in the best of
[1:10:14] clothes do everything else they're
[1:10:15] considered amen backslid they're not so
[1:10:18] and so amen that's that that fell upon
[1:10:20] Thorns but watch in verse eight amen but
[1:10:23] other fell on good
[1:10:25] ground so there's Wayside there's rocks
[1:10:28] there's Thorns but then there's good
[1:10:30] ground Watch what it done and it sprang
[1:10:32] up amen and bear fruit a h hundredfold
[1:10:35] and when he had said these things he
[1:10:37] cried and said he that hath ears to hear
[1:10:40] Amen Let Him hear now watch this he that
[1:10:43] hath ears to hear Amen Let Him hear what
[1:10:46] is he hearing he is hearing the word of
[1:10:48] God that is being forerun because the
[1:10:50] word always has a forerunner amen and
[1:10:53] the one that's forerunning that word is
[1:10:55] announcing what's in that word and he
[1:10:57] said Christ is in that word then
[1:11:00] everything the church has need of is in
[1:11:02] that word I love how the prophet brings
[1:11:04] this testimony into this scripture amen
[1:11:07] y'all remember over in Finland when the
[1:11:08] boy died the prophet of God said watch
[1:11:11] he said remember little boy being raised
[1:11:12] from the dead in Finland how many here
[1:11:14] wrote that in their Bible before it come
[1:11:16] to pass you heard me speak of it in the
[1:11:18] auditorium raise your hand he said about
[1:11:20] the little boy being raised from the
[1:11:22] dead in Finland he said see your hands
[1:11:24] go up all over the building everywhere
[1:11:25] look at it amen see that was long before
[1:11:28] it took place so years before it took
[1:11:31] place there were people that was hearing
[1:11:34] that word and they were writing it down
[1:11:35] in their Bibles and the prophet said see
[1:11:38] amen it always speaks that way and you
[1:11:40] just write it down it's perfect for it's
[1:11:42] not man that's speaking it's God Amen
[1:11:45] this is God's voice to the people every
[1:11:48] word of God is a seed and will produce
[1:11:51] exactly like it's spoken the Bible amen
[1:11:53] if it's received in good ground he said
[1:11:56] now that's God's voice to his church
[1:11:59] listen friend somewhere sometime amen
[1:12:01] the word had been a commission to be
[1:12:03] forerun by prophets and he was in
[1:12:06] position in Finland over at dead boy no
[1:12:09] life in him amen but he spoke the word
[1:12:11] of Christ that had Resurrection in him
[1:12:13] and he said if this boy's not off the
[1:12:15] ground in five minutes I'm a false
[1:12:17] prophet and in five minutes time a boy
[1:12:20] that was crushed to death under a car
[1:12:22] got up and lived again because the word
[1:12:25] was a good word and there was good
[1:12:27] ground to receive the good word amen
[1:12:29] come on church I believe that same word
[1:12:32] is in this building tonight and the
[1:12:33] devil's done everything he can to kill
[1:12:36] our expectations to kill our faith to
[1:12:38] kill our vision to stomp out our joy to
[1:12:41] choke out our praise amen but I speak
[1:12:43] the name of Jesus which is the word of
[1:12:46] Resurrection over this church and I say
[1:12:48] Satan you are defeated the word has been
[1:12:50] forun it is fallen into good ground and
[1:12:53] there's a good ground to produce the
[1:12:55] good word and they're going to raise up
[1:12:57] again and they're going to live
[1:12:59] underneath that word because this word
[1:13:01] is God's voice to his church the word is
[1:13:06] God's
[1:13:07] voice to his church I just thought this
[1:13:11] kind of interesting today brother God
[1:13:12] said lady come up here if all that long
[1:13:14] message in time amen if all that long
[1:13:16] message in the time if it just fell by
[1:13:18] the wayside then the birds of the air
[1:13:21] will gather it he said some will Paul in
[1:13:23] pretty good ground somebody say pretty
[1:13:25] good ground you know that sounds pretty
[1:13:27] good don't it brother Joe pretty good
[1:13:29] ground but listen what a prophet says
[1:13:31] they may believe for a few days so
[1:13:33] brother Terry there's a difference in
[1:13:35] pretty good ground and good ground after
[1:13:38] a while by and by the hot weather and
[1:13:39] the scorching people said did you ever
[1:13:41] go there that meeting well there wasn't
[1:13:43] nothing to it Scorch away others will
[1:13:45] come up amen and they will think it's a
[1:13:47] little more and they'll fall away but
[1:13:49] some will fall in good ground amen the
[1:13:52] same word that fall falls upon pretty
[1:13:54] good ground we've all seen pretty good
[1:13:55] ground amen pretty good for a few days
[1:13:58] but then they're gone amen but watch
[1:14:00] we're all responsible as sewing and God
[1:14:03] has to direct the seed because he knows
[1:14:05] who's his from the beginning God knows
[1:14:08] who's his from the beginning amen so God
[1:14:11] sends out a good word to a good seed to
[1:14:14] produce a good result in Psalms 80 ver8
[1:14:17] the Bible said thou has brought a vine
[1:14:19] out of Egypt thou has cast out the
[1:14:21] Heathen and planted it thou has prepared
[1:14:23] this room before it and did his cause it
[1:14:25] to take deep fruit and it filled the
[1:14:27] land remember said you picked up the
[1:14:29] vine out of Egypt and you brought it out
[1:14:30] and planted in a good place he said that
[1:14:33] was Israel God's people that was in
[1:14:35] Egypt they were a good Vine they were
[1:14:37] God's chosen amen but if a good Vine
[1:14:39] isn't set in good ground it'll not bring
[1:14:42] forth good fruits it depends on where
[1:14:44] the vine is planted will determine the
[1:14:47] results of the crop so God picked up
[1:14:49] Israel out of a Barren land he said
[1:14:52] something like today we got a land many
[1:14:54] great and fine Believers they're all
[1:14:55] mixed in denominational churches they
[1:14:57] come from different denominations
[1:14:59] different walks of life that's why in my
[1:15:00] Ministry I have never tried to at any
[1:15:02] time to run down any certain person or
[1:15:05] any denomination because in them is all
[1:15:07] good people they're all God's called and
[1:15:10] chosen people could you have condemned
[1:15:12] Israel amen while it was in Egypt they
[1:15:14] just got off on the wrong foot and their
[1:15:16] sins had separated them from God they
[1:15:18] were planted in Egypt that's the way
[1:15:20] many people are in churches today
[1:15:22] they're good people people just planted
[1:15:24] in the wrong place amen they're good
[1:15:26] people just planted in the wrong place
[1:15:29] if a real believer is brought to Christ
[1:15:31] he is planted in some great denomination
[1:15:34] that doesn't believe in miracles signs
[1:15:36] and wonders of the Lord the person may
[1:15:37] be a genuine Christian a Catholic
[1:15:39] Baptist Presbyterian over witness
[1:15:41] something else in that church a genuine
[1:15:43] Vine of God Amen but the denominational
[1:15:45] Creeds will cut off the life of the vine
[1:15:48] it cannot bear its fruit and usually
[1:15:50] what fruit you get off the vine that's
[1:15:52] stuned amen or not in good ground is bad
[1:15:54] fruits it'll come forth like apples but
[1:15:57] it'll be naughty and worm eaten it
[1:15:59] becomes a subject for all insects amen
[1:16:01] and good healthy Vine doesn't even have
[1:16:03] to be sprayed amen it's healthy enough

[1:17:05] world they're living off of the true
[1:17:09] nourishment now we know what a seed when
[1:17:12] it falls in the right kind of ground not
[1:17:13] upon rocks with no root or in thorns and
[1:17:16] thistles that would choking out but in
[1:17:18] good Rich fertile faith I like that good
[1:17:21] Rich fertile Faith every seed will bring
[1:17:24] forth of its kind I'm just going to and
[1:17:27] just let the evangels come out for a
[1:17:28] minute we all know that every seed or
[1:17:30] promise of God will bring forth of its
[1:17:32] kind what it's promised if it strikes
[1:17:35] the right ground the ground that's
[1:17:36] prepared ready all the Rocks has been
[1:17:39] thrown out and The Roots and the
[1:17:42] bitterness come on church and the
[1:17:44] selfishness and the indifference and the
[1:17:46] jealousy has all been grubbed out that
[1:17:49] root of bitterness that Springs up that
[1:17:52] sometimes so spook the thing amen that
[1:17:54] God is trying to do amen listen a
[1:17:56] prophet emphasized Amen on a root of
[1:17:59] bitterness that'll spring up amen and'll
[1:18:01] try to Rob amen and stop and spool the
[1:18:04] thing that God is trying to do can I
[1:18:07] tell you what Paul said he said that a
[1:18:09] root of bitterness would spring up amen
[1:18:11] unexpectedly amen and here the prophet
[1:18:13] says that bitterness amen is something
[1:18:15] that tries to spool the thing that God
[1:18:18] is trying to do he said we pray there
[1:18:19] wouldn't be none of that among us but
[1:18:21] for good word well find good ground amen
[1:18:24] four different types of ground I want
[1:18:26] you to catch this the disciples in verse
[1:18:28] 9 the disciples ask him saying what
[1:18:31] might this Parable be and he said unto
[1:18:33] them it is given to know the mysteries
[1:18:35] of the kingdom of God but to others in
[1:18:37] Parables that see and they may not see
[1:18:40] and hearing they may not understand look
[1:18:42] here in Luke 8:1 now the parable is this
[1:18:45] that the seed is the word of God so his
[1:18:48] seed is the word of God that falls
[1:18:51] brother Kevin on four different types of
[1:18:53] ground I want you to catch something
[1:18:55] here amen all hear the seed
[1:18:58] word the Wayside ground heard the seed
[1:19:01] word the rocky ground heard the seed
[1:19:03] word the the the the the the the thorn
[1:19:06] ground the Wayside heard the seed word
[1:19:09] and the good ground heard the seed word
[1:19:11] because there's four different types of
[1:19:12] ground but in verse 12 he begins to show
[1:19:15] us the four different types of hears he
[1:19:18] said those by the wayside are they that
[1:19:20] hear then cometh the devil and taketh
[1:19:22] away the the word out of their heart
[1:19:24] amen lest they should believe and be
[1:19:25] saved can I tell you what kind of
[1:19:27] hearers they those are they are
[1:19:29] indifferent hearers in verse 13 they on
[1:19:32] the Rock are they which when they hear
[1:19:33] receive the word with joy and these have
[1:19:35] no root which for a while believe but in
[1:19:38] the time of Temptation Fall Away sister
[1:19:41] Jame those are emotional hears Amen in
[1:19:44] verse 14 that which fell among Thorns
[1:19:46] are they which when they have heard go
[1:19:48] forth and are choked with cares and
[1:19:50] riches and pleasures of this life and
[1:19:52] bring forth no fruit to Perfection can I
[1:19:54] tell you what they are amen they are
[1:19:56] worldly hears but I love verse 15
[1:19:59] because that on good ground are they
[1:20:02] which in an honest and good heart having
[1:20:03] heard the word amen they keep it and
[1:20:06] bring forth fruit with patience you know
[1:20:08] what kind of hearers those are they are
[1:20:10] receptive hearers amen so they're not
[1:20:12] just hearing emotionally they're not
[1:20:14] just hearing iny they're not just
[1:20:16] hearing worldly but they're receptive
[1:20:18] hears and look at what this word heard
[1:20:20] means it means to be endued with The
[1:20:23] Faculty of hearing not death to consider
[1:20:26] what is or has been said amen listen
[1:20:28] this to give ear to a teaching or a
[1:20:30] teacher to comprehend or to understand

[1:20:53] there's a bride in the last days that's
[1:20:55] not just hearing this message through a
[1:20:57] worldly filter she's not just hearing it
[1:20:59] through an indifferent filter she's not
[1:21:01] even just hearing it through an
[1:21:02] emotional filter but there is a fing
[1:21:04] man's filter and it's called the word of
[1:21:07] God and it is falling upon her life and
[1:21:09] when she hears the word she believes the
[1:21:12] word she receives the word amen and she
[1:21:15] gives an ear she gives her spiritual ear
[1:21:17] to the teaching of the word of God that
[1:21:19] she's hearing because she knows that
[1:21:22] this is going to change her future come
[1:21:24] on church she knows that this is going
[1:21:26] to change her body she knows if I don't
[1:21:29] pay attention to this I'm going to find
[1:21:31] myself in a tribulation period but if I
[1:21:33] can hear the word then faith is going to
[1:21:35] come in my heart and that heart faith is
[1:21:38] going to be rapturing faith and the
[1:21:40] Millennium is going to be behind that
[1:21:42] word and I'm going to find myself in the
[1:21:44] glories of God and the eternities of God
[1:21:47] because I heard I believed I
[1:21:51] received I don't know about you I want
[1:21:53] to be a receptive hearer I want to be a
[1:21:56] come on Amen I know we listen to tapes
[1:21:58] amen but let me just say this amen don't
[1:22:00] just listen driving down the road come
[1:22:02] on I driving down the road you got to
[1:22:05] pay attention this car and look at this
[1:22:07] sign and watch for that exit come on but
[1:22:09] when you hear I'm not telling you not to
[1:22:11] listen in your car but sometimes you
[1:22:13] just got to shut off everything you got
[1:22:15] to shut off the phone you got to shut
[1:22:17] off the world you got to shut off a job
[1:22:20] and you got to get yourself in a place
[1:22:22] that you can be more than just an
[1:22:23] emotional hearer you can be more than
[1:22:25] just a worldly hearer you can be more
[1:22:27] than just an indifferent hear but you
[1:22:29] can be a receptive he you can give your
[1:22:32] ear to the teaching of the word of God I
[1:22:34] love what the prophet said he said as we
[1:22:36] read the words tonight and teach from
[1:22:38] Thy word may it give Faith to The
[1:22:40] Listener and may the seeds fall in good
[1:22:43] ground and bring forth a h hundredfold
[1:22:46] amen I tell you this the Bible speaks of
[1:22:48] it in Ezra 8: 211 the Bible says then I
[1:22:51] proclaimed a fast there at the river of
[1:22:54] ahava that we might afflict ourselves
[1:22:56] before our God watch what he says to
[1:22:58] seek of him a right way for us sometimes
[1:23:02] you got to humble yourself to seek a
[1:23:05] right way from God for your family
[1:23:07] listen church and for our little ones
[1:23:10] and for all of our substance in Jeremiah
[1:23:13] 42:3 the Bible says that the Lord thy
[1:23:16] God I'm sorry guys I didn't give them to
[1:23:17] you for church y'all forgive me the Lord
[1:23:20] thy God Amen may show us the way wherein
[1:23:22] we may walk and the thing that we may do
[1:23:25] I love Psalms 143:10 David says teach me
[1:23:29] to do thy will for thou art my God thy
[1:23:32] spirit is good amen lead me into the
[1:23:34] land of uprightness now watch what
[1:23:36] David's saying you're not going to find
[1:23:38] the land of uprightness unless somebody
[1:23:40] leads you into it so David humbled
[1:23:43] himself and said God I know I'm a man
[1:23:45] after your own heart brother Daniel he
[1:23:47] knew how to sling a slingshot he knew
[1:23:49] how to play a har he knew how to bless
[1:23:51] the name of Jehovah but here David
[1:23:53] humbles himself and says God I need you
[1:23:55] to be my teacher I need you to teach me
[1:23:58] how to do thy will I need you to teach
[1:24:00] me how to find the land of the
[1:24:02] uprightness come on there's going to be
[1:24:04] times Church well let's just go ahead
[1:24:05] and preach it's Wednesday night we might
[1:24:06] as well you don't know that all that
[1:24:08] neither do I so sometimes we got to
[1:24:11] Humble ourselves and say God will you
[1:24:13] teach me your word will you teach me
[1:24:15] your will come on church amen I tell you
[1:24:17] what God did not give us a pastor in
[1:24:18] this church amen just to make sure
[1:24:20] there's somebody to feel the pull pit
[1:24:22] three times a week amen but a pastor is
[1:24:25] a Shepherd a pastor is a leader a pastor
[1:24:28] is a voice of God to the Church of God
[1:24:30] listen friends and he's more than just a
[1:24:32] preacher he's a counselor he's a
[1:24:34] comforter he's a guide and whatever he's
[1:24:36] teaching ought to be more than just a
[1:24:38] good Sunday morning sermon it ought to
[1:24:40] be more than well just brother Sean done
[1:24:42] a good job we ought to Humble ourselves
[1:24:44] and say God use my pastor to teach me
[1:24:47] the word to Lead Me In the Land of the
[1:24:49] uprightness because Faith cometh by
[1:24:52] hearing hear
[1:24:53] in now I know I know people don't like
[1:24:56] to be taught it's an age where everybody
[1:24:57] knows everything but guess what I don't
[1:24:59] know
[1:25:00] everything and neither do
[1:25:03] you but God sent us a message that does
[1:25:06] brother B said what rather watch your in
[1:25:08] Proverbs 9:9 give instruction to a wise
[1:25:10] man and he will yet be wiser woo brother
[1:25:15] give instruction to a w well brother
[1:25:17] Terry a wise man's already wise but here
[1:25:19] the Bible says if you give instruction
[1:25:21] to a wise man he will be yet wiser he
[1:25:24] says teach a just man and he will
[1:25:27] increase in learning teach a wise man
[1:25:30] something and he'll be wiser amen you
[1:25:32] want to know the difference between a
[1:25:33] wise man and a fool amen a wise man will
[1:25:35] be wiser and a fool will be more
[1:25:38] arrogant well else glory to God somebody
[1:25:40] shout amen ouch oh me my or something
[1:25:43] are you hearing me amen a fool will say
[1:25:45] well I know that and I know how to do
[1:25:47] that amen but a wise man will say I'm
[1:25:48] wrong and whoever is right is right and
[1:25:51] I want to be wise Wier so I'm going to
[1:25:53] humble myself I'm going to give myself
[1:25:55] to the teaching and a just man will say
[1:25:57] Lord I want to increase in learning now
[1:25:59] you all know what the prophet said he
[1:26:01] said preaching the word catches The
[1:26:03] Sinner he said but teaching the word
[1:26:06] amen positionally places the believer
[1:26:08] and you can never have faith until
[1:26:11] positionally we know what we are can I
[1:26:13] say this to you from my heart it is
[1:26:16] essential somebody say essential it is
[1:26:19] essential to have a teachable spirit
[1:26:23] it is essential to have a teachable
[1:26:26] spirit in the unpardonable sin the
[1:26:28] prophet said then when we come sanely
[1:26:30] sound to God when we come without any
[1:26:32] malice any Prejudice with an open heart
[1:26:35] amen willing to learn amen God is able
[1:26:38] to teach when we are willing to learn so
[1:26:41] there's no question of God's ability to
[1:26:43] teach us the question of ability is are
[1:26:46] we able to Humble ourselves and learn
[1:26:49] but we must first lay aside tradition I
[1:26:52] may get tied here for a second amen but
[1:26:54] the teaching of the message will have no
[1:26:56] influence upon a traditional heart amen
[1:26:58] the teaching of the message will have no
[1:27:00] influence Upon A Heart amen that's full
[1:27:02] of things and ideas and preconceived
[1:27:05] notions listen friends either this
[1:27:07] message is a filter or it's another idea
[1:27:10] but I believe it's a filter and I
[1:27:12] believe it's coming this generation to
[1:27:13] filter out every tradition to filter out
[1:27:16] every previous idea that we might come
[1:27:18] back to good ground and receive the word
[1:27:21] with a heart to hear and a faith to
[1:27:23] believe and a mouth to confess and a
[1:27:26] spirit to be
[1:27:27] taught lay aside tradition lay aside
[1:27:31] ideas that we've been taught he said now
[1:27:33] I know mother taught you things that was
[1:27:35] very good and so forth but sometimes
[1:27:37] amen mothers had things wrong now come
[1:27:40] on Church brother BR backs that up and
[1:27:41] things are to be in 1965 and says the
[1:27:44] church has grown from what our mama
[1:27:46] taught us about heaven and said it's not
[1:27:48] somewhere brother Shi that we go play a
[1:27:50] harp and we float around on the the
[1:27:52] clouds he said that's what our mothers
[1:27:54] taught us amen before the word come into
[1:27:57] existence the opening of The Seven Seals
[1:28:00] and brought a revelation in the church
[1:28:02] amen that heaven is a real place well if
[1:28:04] you want to hold on to what mama taught
[1:28:06] then you're still looking for a harp and
[1:28:08] you're still looking for a cloud and
[1:28:10] you're still looking for bodies to go
[1:28:11] floating through the air amen but if you
[1:28:13] want to lay aside what mama taught and
[1:28:16] believe what the prophet of God T you
[1:28:18] will believe that the Rapture is already
[1:28:20] started you will believe that you're in
[1:28:21] the rapsure progress right now by the
[1:28:24] preaching of the message of the hour
[1:28:26] something is moved in you that you've
[1:28:28] laid aside tradition come on church
[1:28:31] sometimes you got to lay aside tradition
[1:28:32] to move
[1:28:34] further you cannot stay where life was
[1:28:38] you got to get to where life is come on
[1:28:40] church and one time life was in just I
[1:28:43] live by faith and it was in
[1:28:45] sanctification and it was in the baptism
[1:28:47] of the Holy Ghost amen but life has
[1:28:49] moved from the stalk it's moved from the
[1:28:51] tassel it's moved from the husk and the
[1:28:53] seed has gathered in the seed then every
[1:28:56] ounce of life that was in justification
[1:28:59] is in this bride every ounce of life
[1:29:01] that was in sanctification is in this
[1:29:03] bride and every ounce of life that was
[1:29:06] in the baptism of the Holy Ghost age is
[1:29:08] in this bride are you hearing me you got
[1:29:12] to have a teachable spirit it's
[1:29:14] essential you know what teachable is
[1:29:16] it's essential Amen to enter into God's
[1:29:18] Kingdom in Matthew 18:3 the Bible said
[1:29:22] verily I say unto you except you be
[1:29:24] converted and become as little children
[1:29:27] ye shall not enter into the Kingdom of
[1:29:29] Heaven I just St there something struck
[1:29:30] me amen he did not say in Behavior he
[1:29:33] meant in humility of
[1:29:36] Spirit come on now because Paul said
[1:29:40] when I was a child I spake as a child
[1:29:43] but there come a time I laid
[1:29:45] aside childish things and become a
[1:29:49] man teachableness is exhibited by by the
[1:29:52] disciples in the Book of Luke 11:1 it
[1:29:55] came to pass that as he was praying in a
[1:29:56] certain place when he ceased one of his
[1:29:59] disciples said unto him Lord teach us to
[1:30:01] pray as John also taught his disciples I
[1:30:04] want you to catch this word teach it
[1:30:06] means to impart instruction it means to
[1:30:09] instill Doctrine into one it is the
[1:30:11] thing taught to explain or expand a
[1:30:14] thing to teach one something you know
[1:30:16] what teachable this was it was manifest
[1:30:18] in the blind man of John N in John 9:36
[1:30:21] he answered and said who is he Lord that
[1:30:23] I might believe on him you know what
[1:30:25] teachable this also was manifested in it
[1:30:28] was manifested on the day of Pentecost
[1:30:30] when the Bible said in Acts 2:37 when
[1:30:32] they heard this they were pricked in
[1:30:34] their heart and said un Peter to the
[1:30:36] rest of the Apostles men and Brethren
[1:30:38] what shall we do so they're humbling
[1:30:40] themselves that they don't know what to
[1:30:42] do but there's somebody here that does
[1:30:44] know what to do come on church amen
[1:30:46] teachableness is seen in the Ethiopian
[1:30:49] unic in Acts 8:31 he said how can I
[1:30:53] except some man should guide me and he
[1:30:55] desired that he would Philip that philli
[1:30:57] would come up and sit with him you know
[1:30:59] what teachable this is also it was the
[1:31:01] secret of Paul's success in Acts chapter
[1:31:04] 9:6 and he trembled and astonished said
[1:31:07] Lord what will thou have me to do and
[1:31:09] the Lord said unto him arise and go into
[1:31:12] the City and it shall be told thee what
[1:31:14] thou must do are you hearing me amen
[1:31:16] here's a man that's got the intelligence
[1:31:19] of Gia he's met the pillar of Fire he
[1:31:22] been changed from Saul to Paul but in
[1:31:24] all those Supernatural experiences he
[1:31:27] never lost the ability to be taught by
[1:31:29] the spirit of God you know what teach of
[1:31:31] us is it is a result and we see the
[1:31:34] result in the Philippian jailers
[1:31:36] conversion in Acts 16 verse 29 then he
[1:31:39] called for a light and sprang in and
[1:31:41] came trembling and fell down before Paul
[1:31:43] and Silas and brought them out and said
[1:31:45] sir what must I do to be saved remember
[1:31:49] what that word here means it means to
[1:31:51] give an ear to a teaching or a teacher
[1:31:53] can I ask you a question who is the
[1:31:57] teacher who is the teacher not a trick
[1:32:00] question the holy spirit in John 14:26
[1:32:03] he said the comforter which is the Holy
[1:32:05] Ghost amen the Holy Ghost whom the
[1:32:07] father will send Amen in my name he
[1:32:10] shall teach you all things and he bring
[1:32:14] all things to your remembrance
[1:32:15] whatsoever I have said unto you in John

[1:34:42] wrong with getting happy when we see the
[1:34:44] church get back in order what's wrong
[1:34:46] with getting happy when we see the Holy

[1:34:50] carrying Beyond his human education and
[1:34:52] begin to teach things that has
[1:34:54] confounded religious leaders for years
[1:34:56] there ought to be a shout in the house

[1:35:33] ground I know some people don't get

[1:35:48] the house of God one more time under the
[1:35:51] spout where the Revelation is coming out
[1:35:54] where there's an anointing falling and
[1:35:56] there's a teaching taking place come on
[1:35:58] Church y'all know I believe in teaching
[1:36:00] I believe in good Bible Holy Ghost
[1:36:02] teaching I tell you what I do not
[1:36:03] believe and it's a bunch of educated men
[1:36:05] getting behind the pull pit and teaching
[1:36:07] the holy ghost out of the church and I
[1:36:09] tell you what we've defined teaching as
[1:36:11] we've defined teaching as anybody that
[1:36:13] can't preach well let me just say this
[1:36:15] amen I believe in good Bible teaching
[1:36:17] but good Bible teaching is going to
[1:36:19] teach the word of God and not be the
[1:36:21] people out of the power of God it's
[1:36:23] going to bring an emotion come on Church
[1:36:26] am I probably had to preach a whole
[1:36:28] sermon let you know I believe in
[1:36:29] teachers I believe in Bible teaching but
[1:36:32] I do not believe in dead letters killing
[1:36:34] the church I believe if a man's called
[1:36:37] brother Terry there's an anointing upon
[1:36:39] him there's a blessing upon him there's
[1:36:41] an inspiration come on church amen I've
[1:36:43] seen preachers never move behind the
[1:36:45] pull pit and I was about ready to
[1:36:46] explode and I've seen guys never move
[1:36:48] behind the pull pit well come on Church
[1:36:51] I'm I'm this far into I might as well
[1:36:52] preach amen I literally set sister Jane
[1:36:54] in services and never seen the man move
[1:36:57] from behind the pull pit but something
[1:36:58] inside of me was welling up because
[1:37:01] there was a certain sound I was hearing
[1:37:03] and I've seen guys run all across the
[1:37:05] platform and I was checking my watch to
[1:37:07] see when they'd be done cuz there wasn't
[1:37:09] nothing said amen to move me from
[1:37:11] confusion into order if this message is
[1:37:14] preached there's going to be a
[1:37:15] demonstration of the power of God come
[1:37:18] behind the word and set the church in
[1:37:20] order and teach the church the will of
[1:37:22] God and guide the church into the land
[1:37:25] of uprightness what a wonderful time oh
[1:37:28] my when the Holy Ghost breaks out on the
[1:37:31] church now I don't know about this I'll
[1:37:34] just say thank God for our men of God
[1:37:35] that preach this
[1:37:38] message thank God for our teachers that
[1:37:40] stand there and labor in the word thank
[1:37:42] God for our vanss that come in like a
[1:37:43] house on fire and then they get out of
[1:37:45] the way thank God for our pastors who
[1:37:47] who who who Bear Down Under the load and
[1:37:50] they carry the load when it's
[1:37:52] TR come on church amen but there's an
[1:37:54] anointing behind
[1:37:58] them now the tutor always pointed that
[1:38:01] I'm I'm GNA get through that the tutor
[1:38:03] always pointed the child of the father
[1:38:04] and to have him to be the have him to
[1:38:06] believe the father and when the tutor
[1:38:08] was a trainer this morning as I was
[1:38:09] looking at my dear little companion and
[1:38:11] I seen my little son think about this I
[1:38:13] seen my little son when he throw his
[1:38:14] little tan temp tantrum at the table
[1:38:16] with his little dish with his eggs and
[1:38:17] things the mother had worked so
[1:38:18] Faithfully to fix for his breakfast and
[1:38:20] she was trying to teach teach him to eat
[1:38:21] with a spoon and he wanted to take the
[1:38:23] wrong hand brother am he wanted to take
[1:38:25] the wrong hand he said well to me I said
[1:38:27] let him have that hand but the mother no
[1:38:29] different she knew if she let him keep
[1:38:30] on that way he'd be either ambidextrous
[1:38:33] or he'd be left-handed I was on the
[1:38:34] phone with Josh Martin I read that quote
[1:38:36] I said I just found out you're
[1:38:37] abnormal you're
[1:38:39] left-handed and then I got thinking they
[1:38:41] put me in a class to prove I was
[1:38:43] ambidexter so
[1:38:45] I'm I always heard it brother amamos I
[1:38:47] didn't know it was actually they
[1:38:48] actually considered it wrong but the
[1:38:50] prophet of God said why watch he said if
[1:38:51] she let him keep that way it'd be either
[1:38:53] ambidexter or he'd be left-handed and
[1:38:54] that's not normal so a real trainer as a
[1:38:56] real trainer she made him change hands
[1:38:59] though he didn't like it but the mother
[1:39:00] knowed it was the best and many times
[1:39:02] our train of the Holy Spirit we try to
[1:39:04] do the wrong way but sometimes it hurts
[1:39:06] us woo brother sometimes it hurts us
[1:39:09] listen sometimes we may lay on a bed of
[1:39:11] Affliction sometimes the doctor May say
[1:39:13] all Hope's gone but it's the Holy Spirit
[1:39:16] teaching us to use the right
[1:39:19] hand now come on let's let's move out of
[1:39:21] left hand right hand let's move into the
[1:39:23] word of God the Bible says to whom has
[1:39:26] believed our report and to whom is the
[1:39:29] arm of the Lord revealed then what a
[1:39:31] prophet was showing you I don't have
[1:39:33] time to get to it I'm out of time but he
[1:39:34] says this he said see it's the power of
[1:39:37] God that will change the man Christ the
[1:39:39] mystery the power of God will change the
[1:39:41] man and Paul said when I come to you I
[1:39:44] did not come to you in enticing words of
[1:39:46] man's Wisdom can I say it like this
[1:39:48] brother Sean left hand I did not come to
[1:39:50] you you with the left hand of man's
[1:39:52] Wisdom but I come to you in the power
[1:39:55] and the demonstration of the Holy Ghost
[1:39:57] y'all forgive me this is going out the
[1:39:58] internet and I got a bunch of
[1:39:59] left-handed friends you're not abnormal
[1:40:01] are you are you hearing me a amen he was
[1:40:03] showing you amen change hands move from
[1:40:06] wisdom into faith and church Living God
[1:40:08] some of y'all right here tonight need to
[1:40:10] let the Holy Spirit move you out of
[1:40:12] wisdom into Faith because wisdom's
[1:40:14] taking your shout and it's taking your
[1:40:16] vision and it's taking your praise but
[1:40:18] if you can move from the wisdom of man
[1:40:20] into to the power of the faith of God
[1:40:22] it'll open up a whole new dimension to
[1:40:24] you you'll see beyond your problems
[1:40:26] you'll see beyond the report you know
[1:40:28] why amen because the teacher the holy
[1:40:31] spirit is not on the outside he's come
[1:40:33] on the inside oh my are you hearing me
[1:40:36] then brother Terry all these years that
[1:40:38] you've been giving your ear to this
[1:40:40] message you've been lending your ear to
[1:40:42] the teaching of this message the teacher
[1:40:45] has now moved from the outside to the
[1:40:47] inside I'd have paid a hundred bucks for
[1:40:49] the teacher to take my my test in school
[1:40:52] she had a passed him unlike me I are you
[1:40:55] hearing me you wanted the teacher to
[1:40:57] always be there but there come a time
[1:40:59] that the teacher couldn't be there but
[1:41:01] it's not so with this
[1:41:03] teacher Oh Glory it's not so with this
[1:41:07] teacher he said when God is silent we
[1:41:09] had better be silent but where he has
[1:41:11] spoken we had better speak too and say
[1:41:13] what is already said he told us the
[1:41:15] evidence what would happen after being
[1:41:17] baptized with the Holy Ghost watch this
[1:41:19] the teacher would come and teach all
[1:41:21] truth but that teacher was an inside
[1:41:23] teacher not an outside teacher if the
[1:41:26] spirit wasn't inside then you wouldn't
[1:41:28] hear the truth and receive it by
[1:41:30] Revelation if you heard it every moment
[1:41:33] of the day woo brother if the spirit
[1:41:37] wasn't inside you wouldn't hear the
[1:41:40] truth and receive it by Revelation if
[1:41:44] you heard it every moment of the day
[1:41:46] that was the sign of the indwelling
[1:41:48] indwelling spirit in the days of Paul
[1:41:50] those who were filled with the Holy
[1:41:51] Ghost heard the word they received it
[1:41:53] and they lived by it and those who did
[1:41:56] not have the spirit heard it as only
[1:41:57] carnal men put a wrong interpretation on
[1:42:00] it and went into sin but in every age is
[1:42:04] the age of the Holy Ghost for the True
[1:42:06] Believer I say in every age the evidence
[1:42:09] was the same those who had the spirit
[1:42:11] the teacher they heard the word and that
[1:42:15] spirit in them took the word and taught
[1:42:17] it revealed it to them and they were of
[1:42:20] the group that heard heard the message
[1:42:22] and the messenger and took it and lived
[1:42:26] it our musicians are coming tonight
[1:42:29] brother said this in the resume of the
[1:42:30] church ages l a c age he said this is
[1:42:32] the age that turned to the 20th century
[1:42:34] as it was to be the age in which the
[1:42:36] true church would be return to be the
[1:42:37] bride she was at Pentecost we know that
[1:42:40] there must of necessity be a return of
[1:42:43] dynamic power brother Amos there must be
[1:42:47] a necessity think about that brother
[1:42:49] Amos there must be of a necessity a
[1:42:52] return of dynamic power Amen Brother
[1:42:55] Bill a return of dynamic power
[1:42:58] necessity what's that word brother amus
[1:43:01] necessity it's got to be here so it
[1:43:04] cannot just be in letter letter letter
[1:43:06] but the dynamic power has got to return
[1:43:09] and the Believers sensed it in their
[1:43:11] spirits and begin crying to God for new
[1:43:13] outpouring such as was in the first
[1:43:14] century now watch this what seemed to be
[1:43:16] the answer came as many begin to speak
[1:43:17] in tongues manifest the gifts of the
[1:43:19] Spirit it was believe that this was
[1:43:21] indeed the long awaited restoration it
[1:43:24] was not for the latter rign can only
[1:43:27] come after the former Reign which is the
[1:43:28] spirit or teaching rain so the latter
[1:43:30] rain then is the Harvest rain and how
[1:43:33] could this be the real thing when the
[1:43:34] teaching rain had not come the prophet
[1:43:36] messenger who was to be sent to teach
[1:43:38] the people and to turn their hearts back
[1:43:41] to the Pentecostal fathers had not yet
[1:43:43] come thus what was thought to be the
[1:43:44] restoration the final quickening of the
[1:43:46] Rapture had not come in it was a mixture
[1:43:49] of the unrighteous partaking spiritual
[1:43:51] blessing and manifest manifesting in the
[1:43:53] Holy Ghost as we have kept poined out to
[1:43:55] you it is also oh my it is also devil
[1:43:58] power as men was under the control of
[1:44:00] devils yet no one seemed to realize it
[1:44:02] then to prove that it was not real these
[1:44:04] people even before his second generation
[1:44:06] had appeared organized wrote their
[1:44:09] unscriptural doctrines built their own
[1:44:11] fences as every other group ahead of
[1:44:13] them
[1:44:14] did but a it's that necessity of dynamic
[1:44:18] power can I tell you what that Dynamic
[1:44:21] power was it was the voice of a seventh
[1:44:22] angel yes that stood in the pull pit and
[1:44:26] screamed to these people come out of her
[1:44:28] that's right come out of her my
[1:44:30] people and be not partakers of her sins
[1:44:35] you love him tonight I believe he's real
[1:44:38] don't you listen I believe the sound has
[1:44:40] gone out into the land and I believe
[1:44:42] there's some receptive
[1:44:44] hearers that have given their ear to
[1:44:46] this message and the teacher not on the
[1:44:49] outside but now he's on the
[1:44:53] inside isn't it a beautiful thing
[1:44:55] brother Bill when you come to church and
[1:44:57] you hear the preacher preaching and
[1:44:59] you're sitting there and what he's
[1:45:00] saying you're already agreeing with and
[1:45:02] brother Amos things are connecting in
[1:45:04] your mind and the words just coming
[1:45:06] together brother Sean things are just
[1:45:07] connected left and right and you're
[1:45:09] literally sitting there thinking well I
[1:45:10] just read that and I just read that you
[1:45:12] know why because the spirit teacher on
[1:45:14] the pastor is the Same Spirit teacher in
[1:45:17] you and what he's preaching the spirit's
[1:45:20] preaching through him the spirit in you
[1:45:23] is bearing
[1:45:24] witness because the one Speaking is the
[1:45:27] one that done the
[1:45:29] writing are you hearing me and the
[1:45:31] spirit that's receiving is the one
[1:45:33] that's speaking that done
[1:45:35] [Music]
[1:45:37] the faith cometh by hearing and hearing
[1:45:41] by the word that's why Eagles don't
[1:45:43] respond to the sound of
[1:45:45] buzzards I told somebody other day I
[1:45:47] come out of a service and brother Bill
[1:45:49] they looked at me they said but Andrew
[1:45:51] you you're a pretty emotional person you
[1:45:52] was pretty quiet I said yeah I said I'm
[1:45:54] sorry I didn't have a clue what the
[1:45:55] guy's talking
[1:45:56] about he kind of looked at me said what
[1:45:58] do you mean I said well I study brother
[1:45:59] Brown I don't have a clue who he
[1:46:01] studies we're Eagles so we we we can't
[1:46:05] even we can't even brother SE we can't
[1:46:07] even we can't even manufactur us out cuz
[1:46:10] it's just an uncertain sound that's
[1:46:12] right but when Eagle food begins to come
[1:46:15] out and Eagles begin to hear it and
[1:46:18] receive it then something inside of you
[1:46:20] says amen glory to God that's right I'm
[1:46:24] wrong the message is
[1:46:26] right you got a teachable spirit and
[1:46:29] it's opening a door into another
[1:46:32] dimension oh man I love him tonight I
[1:46:34] wanton you to stand to your feet with us

[1:47:09] Choice ground good ground you know I I I
[1:47:13] think I preached it to you one time they
[1:47:15] they said they didn't want Bethlehem
[1:47:17] they wanted to put Beth Bethlehem out of
[1:47:18] the way the reason they did not want
[1:47:21] Bethlehem was because for years people
[1:47:23] drove by Bethlehem and they looked at
[1:47:25] the ground and said there's nothing good
[1:47:27] come out of it and it was the very
[1:47:30] ground that God chose to raise up the
[1:47:32] seed of the Messiah out of the mystery
[1:47:35] of
[1:47:36] Bethlehem you know tonight friends the
[1:47:39] world looks at you and all they see
[1:47:41] sister ran is just a young girl long
[1:47:43] hair wearing a skirt going to school
[1:47:45] brother Bob all they see is just you
[1:47:47] just going to church and not doing the
[1:47:49] things of the world
[1:47:51] what they don't see is your good ground
