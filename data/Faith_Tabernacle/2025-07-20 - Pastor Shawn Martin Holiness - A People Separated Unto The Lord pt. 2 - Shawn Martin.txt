[Music] Lord, my battle scars are many. My medals must be few. For in the midst of conflicts raging so often I've failed you. But somehow you've kept me standing. You pick me up each time I'd fall. You don't cast out wounded soldiers. You just love them through it all. And one day all the soldiers will come home. We'll cease fighting for the battle will be won. And as the captain says, "Well done. You fought the fight. The race is run. Wounded soldier. The war is over. Never welcome a home. In my heart I am a victor. Many times the flesh is weak. So often I have begged your grace lest I go down in defeat. But Lord, I recall that battle that was fought by you alone. As your blood flowed from that rugged cross, our victory was won. And one day all the soldiers will come home. They'll cease fighting for the battle will be won. And as the captain says, "Well done. You fought the fight. The race is run, wounded soldier. The war is over. Welcome home. In my heart I am a victor. Though many times this flesh is weak, so often I have begged your grace, lest I go down in defeat. But then I recall that battle that was fought by you alone. As your blood ran from that rugging cross, my victory was won. And one day all the soldiers will come home. Oh, they'll cease fighting for the battle will be won. And as the captain says, "Well done. You fought the fight. The race is run. Wounded soldier. The war is over. Welcome home. And as the captain says, "Well done. You fought the fight. The race is run, wounded soldier. Your war is over. Welcome home. [Music] &gt;&gt; When I'm in need, I call on the Lord. Oh, he hears me. Yes, he helps me for he is faithful and true. He won't forget his own. You see, he's my companion, my best friend, the only true God. There's no one greater, a wonderful savior.

Knowing that I can trust him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Trust him with my life. Trust him with my future. Trust him with my past. And trust the Lord in everything of our lives. Amen. &gt;&gt; And if you haven't gotten to that point, I pray you do. Amen. Uh because um uh there's no one like our Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. And it's good to be here uh this morning and um trust that you are glad to be here and the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. And maybe we could just sing this song uh I love him. I love him. &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh, I love him. Yes, I love him. Because he first loved me [Music] and purchase my salvation [Music] on Calary [Music] Sing it again. Oh, I love him. I love him. Do you love him? Oh yes. me first. Love me and purchase my salvation on Calary tree. [Music] Amen. Praise the Lord. If you have your Bibles, we'll just go right on into the word. Isaiah the 43rd chapter. We read these um scriptures a couple weeks ago, I guess. And going to read it again. Um and uh the musicians can be dismissed. Amen. And then um wanted to say brother Andrew Glover will be with us uh next Sunday and ministering for us. So we're looking forward to that. And um also many of you might have heard uh Ann and Branson having a baby and um might have seen a little change in Ann and um not that she's getting grumpy or anything like she said, you know, the uh but uh she's having a they're both having a boy and um so she's having it and he's happy for it. Amen. And uh but we're uh uh glad for them. And um um it's hard to believe my little girl is um well, it's hard to believe she's married and it's really hard to believe she's having a baby, but uh we're we're excited about it. And I guess that'll make um uh our sixth grandchild and uh brother Kevin and Sister Melissa's first. And so we congratulate them. And I know they're excited, that's for sure. And uh we really happy for uh Branson and Anne and pray the Lord just blesses them dearly. Amen. But uh so Isaiah the um 43rd chapter and we're going to start at the first verse. But now thus said the Lord that created thee, oh Jacob, and he that formed thee, O Israel, fear not, for I have redeemed thee. I have called thee by thy name. Thou art mine. When thou passest through the waters, I will be with thee. And through the rivers, uh, they shall not overflow thee. When thou walkest through the fire, thou shalt not be burned, neither shall the flame kindle upon thee. For I am the Lord thy God, the Holy One of Israel, thy Savior. I gave Egypt for thy ransom, Ethiopia and Sabba uh for thee. Uh since thou was precious in my sight, thou hast been honorable, and I have loved thee. Therefore will I give men for thee, and people for thy life. Fear not, for I am with thee. I will bring thy seed from the east, and gather thee from the west. I will say to the north, give up, and to the south, keep not back. Bring my sons from afar, or from far, and my daughters from the ends of the earth. Even everyone that is called by my name. For I have created him for my glory. I have formed him. Yay, I have made him. Then the 21st verse, this people have I formed myself. They shall show forth my praise. Amen. Then if you'll go uh uh the book over, next book over, Jeremiah uh 31. Jeremiah chapter 31 and we'll start at the first verse. At the same time, sayeth the Lord, will I be the God of all the families of Israel, and they shall be my people. Thus sayeth the Lord, the people which were left of the sword found grace in the wilderness, even Israel, when I went to cause him to rest. The Lord hath appeared of old unto me, saying, "Yeah, yeah, I have loved thee with an everlasting love. Therefore, with loving kindness have I drawn thee." Amen. Let's just bow our heads in a word of prayer. Father, we're just truly grateful for your words of life, Father, that we can find comfort, Lord, in our times of here on earth as we live and we face many things of the enemy. But Lord, thy word, thy promise is a comfort to us. And Father, I pray Lord that you would just bless the reading of your word, the ministering of your word, as well as the hearing. Father, may the anointing of your spirit just fall upon us, Lord, and help me to yield myself to you is our prayer. I pray you'd forgive us of our sins and our shortcomings. And Father, may we learn more of how to better conduct ourselves and handle ourselves in this mortal life. Father, for the world sees us and they look and as your prophet said, we're the only Bible that many will ever read. Lord, may we be the right interpretation of it. We ask in Jesus Christ's name. And the church says, &gt;&gt; "Amen." And amen. You can have your seats this morning. Um, so I I'm going to use the title again, holiness, a people separated unto the Lord. And um, we preach the doctrine of holiness. uh because we believe in it &gt;&gt; and we don't preach on it a lot. uh uh well and because I I believe that we we've have gone further as far as in in knowledge of the word revelation but uh to where we know that what is required of us like Paul would say leaving the uh the principles of the doctrine let us go on to perfection not laying again the uh the the the the works of repentance and and these things, but sometimes it's good to go back and look at these things, especially for young people and and and uh things. And so, um, the Lord willing, want to just take some time, um, the next few services, uh, as far as Sundays that I do preach, um, and and deal with this subject of of holiness. &gt;&gt; Uh, we we believe in it and, um, we believe that, uh, holiness is a must. It it's it's it's certainly a a must. Um uh for the Bible says that no man can see God without it. So we've got to have holiness. And um um uh Paul would tell us in Ephesians, God chose us in Christ uh that we should be holy uh and without blame before him in love. So um uh Christianity has holiness in it. &gt;&gt; Um uh the Bible also tells us that we are to follow peace and holiness. Um uh it also there in the book of Psalms I believe it says we are to worship the Lord in the beauty of holiness. So holiness has beauty to it and uh uh it's clean and and pure. Uh it's it's definitely not the beauty that that the world seeks and the women of the world. They seek beauty in a totally different way than what God would call beauty. But uh beauty that God would look at is in holiness. Holiness has beauty. And so, um, the prophet said, "God doesn't dwell in beauty made by hands, but the beauty of holiness is where God dwells." &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; Oadiah 11:17, breaking in, it says, "Upon mount Zion shall be deliverance, and there shall be holiness." Amen. So, so if you're going to see holiness, it'll be with the bride of Christ. Amen. And, uh, there will be deliverance and holiness. Now, you know, u holiness um, uh, looking it up, it's a sacred place or thing. Holiness again is a sacred place or thing, consecrated, dedicated, hallowed. So the the uh the word consecrate means to make or declare sacred to set apart. &gt;&gt; So this is what the beginning of holiness would be is set apart, consecrated uh declared sacred. uh the word dedicate uh uh looking up these three words cuz holiness is a sacred place or thing. Consecrated, dedicated, hallowed. Uh but the word dedicate is to again set apart for a definite use &gt;&gt; to devote to the worship of a divine being. Amen. So, so um dedicated. It's not to be used for nothing else, but for its intended purpose. I I mentioned that last uh week is, you know, when you're wiring a house, we would uh uh there's some some circuits that are dedicated circuits. &gt;&gt; You you can't mix it and have lights on it or or uh uh recepts on it. You can't it can't be used uh refrigerator has got to be a dedicated circuit. uh a stove has got to be a dedicated circuit. In other words, it's just for that and that's it. And uh um and so uh when when we're thinking of holiness, it's not mixed up. It's it's dedicated for one specific thing. Ain't that right? And so uh also the word sacred again, it means to set apart. All three of these consecrate, dedicate, sacred is has that to set apart. To set apart, not not blending in, not mixed in, but taken out from and set apart. It means holy. So, uh um uh uh devote, dedicate, consecrate, hallow. It means to set apart for a special and often higher end. Amen. So it's it's not left in something that is degraded or something that is just common things but is taken out to be set apart for something greater than what it was in. Amen. So uh if if there is to be holiness then there has to be a separation. Can't have holiness and not separation. uh uh and separation has always as we know it's always been God's way. In the beginning of creation, he separated light from darkness. Ain't that right? Uh uh so God from the very get-go, he had to separate. And brother Ram said the reason why he had to separate is the the darkness from light is so that the light could shine upon the seed and bring a bring the seed uh to what it is was supposed to be. So there had to be a separation to make room for the seed to grow. Ain't that right? So then we find that even though Abel and Cain they were twins, they were both worshippers of God. Uh there was no other god at that time that man had made. Uh so they both believed in the same God. Uh uh they worshiped and and built an altar and all of these things and and and all that and and and a sacrifice unto God, but God separated their worship. God separated their sacrifice. God separated this. Amen. By giving Abel a revelation of what sacrifice would be accepted. Amen. Uh uh and so their their sacrifice was different, their worship was different and one was accepted, one was rejected because the revelation made the difference. Revelation separated it. Amen. And so uh when God first came to Abraham, he commanded him to separate himself. And the prophet said, "See, God called for total separation. Separate yourself from your kinsmen. Separate from your father's house. Separate from all your associates. Completely annihilate yourself from all these things and walk with me." Ain't that right? So God is bringing holiness uh to Abraham by separating him, amen, from everything that he has known, amen, because God wanted him to walk with him. Ain't that right? Abraham was to walk with God. And in order to do that, God required a separation. And and brother Brandham says, "What a privilege it is when a man is being called like that." Amen. So, we're not The word holiness is is dear to us because it's it's a separation to walk with God. Amen. Without holiness, you ain't going to walk with God. Without holiness, you will not see God. Ain't that right? See, so we we find amen that God wouldn't bless Abraham fully until he um made a complete separation. Amen. We also read where God separated Israel uh the people that we had just read about in our opening scripture which I believe that that uh as the prophet taught us scripture is a two-fold. So I believe that he was not just talking to a natural people but he's talking to a spiritual people but here is the natural people. God separated them from Egypt and the way that he separated them was by requiring a token of them. Amen. and said, "When I see the blood, I will pass over you." Ain't that right? So, there had to be a separation. And that was by the blood of the lamb. That was by a token. Amen. So, God also commanded the children of Israel to separate themselves from all the heathen nations. Amen. They were to live separate. They they separate lives, separate ways. uh uh they were not to partake in in their heathen practices. They were not to uh uh partake in their worship of other gods. They they were not to um uh even their diet was to be different. Amen. Why? Because they were a holy people. God called them to be a holy people to be separated for a dedicated purpose. Amen. They were to be dedicated unto the Lord, consecrated unto God. Amen. As we've talked about the vessels of the the temple and and uh uh the high priest and everything involving in the temple, God would would make uh uh consecrate they it would be uh uh consecrated for that specific purpose and that alone. Amen. And so uh uh therefore even their diet as I said and we see this when Israel was taken into captivity uh the king like Daniel and Nebuchadnezzar and and uh they they were going to be tested just like a lot of others uh uh but but he wanted them to eat their his his diet, his way, his food and and Daniel and and said no, we can't do that. um uh let us eat the way we're supposed to be eating and then uh try us and and and for a few days and see if there ain't a difference. Right? And there was a difference. Amen. There was a difference in the way they ate. And so uh they kept themselves separated and undefiled even though they were in captivity. Even though they they lived in the palace and uh uh uh were were under the king and serving the king, they kept themselves holy, dedicated, undefiled, consecrated. They had to kept themselves separated. Ain't that right? Well, God has called us to be separated as we've read the scripture 2 Corinthians 6:17. Wherefore, come out from among them. &gt;&gt; Amen. come out from among them. Have you young people, have you wondered why you're so different and why this message is so different? Why people don't understand you and they call you a cult? And it's it's good that they would think us strange. Amen. It's a sign that we've come out. We're we're not mingling. We're not that they don't see us as one of them. We're not trying to be different. I think if anything, they see more of God. They see something in you that they don't see in other Christians and they don't see in other church members of of of different denominations or or whatever. Amen. And and and so this is what God has called us to do. Come out from among them and be separate, sayith the Lord. We shouldn't be afraid to tell what we believe. We shouldn't be afraid. Amen. and and and afraid of criticism and to be rejected and well if I say you know tell them that I believe in a prophet they're going to make fun of me. Well, you should you you well Paul tells us to glory in in persecution when when when they criticize you for the way you believe and and the life you live and and these things. It's not that you're trying to be uh stand out like a sore thrum. Amen. But you're separated. Amen. If they can talk about their ideas and they can talk about their ways, why can't we talk about our ways? Amen. But see, yes, it is strange, but that's fine because God, this message makes us different. Amen. And it's just true. If you're in a message church or you're you say you believe in a prophet and you're scared to talk about a prophet and and you're afraid, well, you've not really sold out to this message. A. Amen. It's just the truth. Amen. Uh uh but we find that it says, "Wherefore come out from among them, and be ye separate, sayeth the Lord. And touch not touch not the unclean thing, and I will receive you and will be a father unto you, and you shall be my sons and daughters, saith the Lord Almighty." Ain't that right? So, so uh uh we we talk about adoption. We talk about the manifestation of sons and and and and and these things, but it cannot happen until there's holiness. Until there is a separation, until we are fully consecrated, dedicated for that purpose. Can you say amen? We're we're not to be used for the devil. My my my body is not for the devil. Amen. To give vent to him, to allow him to express himself. You understand what I'm saying? Amen. And I know he puts negative thoughts in our mind to get us to talk negative. And you talk negative, then you believe negative, then you act negative, and then your worship's negative, and and then your testimony is negative, and then your actions are negative. Well, you're just letting the devil express himself right through you because everything about Christianity is positive. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? That's right. See, every promise of God is positive, not negative. So then we've got to consecrate ourselves, amen, for this purpose, that God could work himself through us. Uh first Peter uh uh 11:15-16 says, "But as he which hath called you is holy, so be ye holy in all manner of conversation." Amen. &gt;&gt; In other words, in all manner of lifestyle, your your life should be holy. Our life should be holy here at the church. Our life should be holy at home. Our life should be holy when we're by ourselves. Our our life should be holy wherever we are. Amen. It we should be holy in everything. When we talk, when we when we act, when we think, when we uh worship, when we sing, when we uh Everything about us should be uh uh our word should be consecrated unto God. You understand what I'm saying? Surely. Amen. Yes. You can't stop things from coming into your mind, but you can sure stop it from uh uh uh Satan from building a nest in your mind and and allow dwelling on these thoughts. Yes, it's easy to dwell on negativity, but as as as Christians, as believers, we understand that we are to be holy. Therefore, we must cast down all reasonings, all imaginations, everything. Brother Brand says, basically, cast down all unbelief. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? So, so your behavior should be holy. Amen. And and because it is written, be ye holy, for I am holy. So be set apart, be dedicated, be consecrated. See, be set apart to the word and that alone. Ain't that right? Amen. Don't hear the word. Rejoice of the word and say, I believe that word. And then when someone else comes in a negative, oh, really? Well, now I don't know what to do. No. Dedicate yourself to that word. I don't care what they say. I don't care how good it looks. I don't care uh uh what it seems like. I'm dedicated to this. I believe this. I'll say this. I confess this. Can you say amen? Dedicated. God wants the word which is his promises to have preeminence in us. Do you believe that? Brother Ram said when a man has the kind of promise given to him like Abraham had, he's asked to separate himself from unbelievers. How many's got the promise that Abraham had? Same kind of promise. Amen. Because we're Abraham's seed. So, we have been given. Amen. We are a people that's been given the same kind of promise that Abraham had. Amen. And therefore, we're asked to separate ourselves from unbelievers. That's what makes so many people fail with healing. come down and the Lord perform a miracle on them and they get off among uh the amongst unbelievers uh that say, "Well, now you're just worked up, dear." You know, uh now you know there's nothing to that. Now, that's just mental emotion. That's the devil. See, and the first thing you know, there's the devil coming right back. And you say, "Well, maybe I I you know, I I don't know." Well, there you are. right back in the same condition where you were. So, you've got to separate yourself. Can you say amen? How many believes in the healing power of God? How many believes in the salvation of God, deliverance of God, everything about the word, God's promises are to us. Amen. But to remain there, to to have them promises effective, Amen. is to separate separate yourself, Amen. from these things. Don't don't think for a minute that you can be a Christian and and live for God without there being a separation. Amen. God has requires you to separate. Amen. See, we're not to be like the world. We're not to talk like the world. We're not to think like the world. We're not to act like the world or behave like the world or uh uh have the mannerisms of the world. Ain't that right? There's a literal separation. Amen. When I'm on the job, I'm separated. When I'm at school, I'm separated. Amen. When I'm among uh uh uh the world, at restaurant, at a restaurant, or or or grocery store or wherever we're at. Amen. Separated. When I'm talking to the center, I'm separated. Can you say amen? Amen. There there's a separation. Now, notice our worship is to be different and what we feed off of is to be different. God help us all. Ain't that right? So, Brother Brham says how happy a real Christian is to separate himself. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. We're happy when we're separating ourselves. This is this isn't doom and gloom. I just don't know. Hey, do I really have to do that? Everybody's going to make fun of me. Everybody's going to look at me different. I'm just the oddball at work. I'm just the oddball at school. I just don't know. I'm even the oddball at church, you know. Well, separate yourself. Amen. believers are happy. Amen. They consider themselves blessed because God has required of them to separate themselves because he's given them the same promise that he gave Abraham. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The word holiness used to have a meaning amongst the church. Uh and with that there was a life portrayed u a certain lifestyle that portrayed holiness. &gt;&gt; The women didn't wear makeup. They didn't wear things that pertained to a man. Right. &gt;&gt; Didn't put on earrings. Didn't put on all kinds of jewelry. Um didn't didn't cut their hair. Men didn't have long hair. didn't smoke, drink, cuss, uh person that that smoked and drank and cussed, they were just automatically considered sinners. And because there was a holiness about the church. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That that uh uh you know that uh sinners felt looked down upon uh a lot of times simply because they felt condemned for what they were doing. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Uh but it was a holiness in the church. &gt;&gt; Uh holiness had meaning amongst Christians. They they didn't go to the movie theater. They didn't hang out at the beach with all the nudity. &gt;&gt; I am so glad my dad kept me from that stuff. Dad wouldn't let us go to the public uh public pools &gt;&gt; because of of the nudity. Uh, dad just didn't let us hang around places that had cigarette smoke and and uh drinking and we we just didn't go to the beach when everybody was out there and the naked ladies and all that. I thank God for a dad that believed in holiness. &gt;&gt; Uh they didn't hang out with sinners. Uh Christians that believed in holiness. Christians just didn't hang out with sinners and unbelievers. Uh they they weren't rude. They they weren't um uh they they weren't snobby. They didn't have a Now some have you know and they still do today have a holier than thou attitude when you you know when they amongst people but but believers true believers just they didn't have that attitude but they didn't hang out with them because there was a holiness there. They they they didn't they didn't have the same lifestyles. They they didn't have the same type of conversations. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hello. &gt;&gt; Usually now Christians uh so-called Christians hang out with everybody and and they'll the the sinners will drink and and and they'll talk about their rock and roll and they'll talk about this and the movies they've watched and all that. And the good little old Christian just stands real silent, not saying a word, just looking around maybe just, oh goodness. But back then there was a holiness. &gt;&gt; Christians actually dominated the atmosphere. &gt;&gt; True. That's true. &gt;&gt; They they dominated it because they believed in something. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; They didn't condone sin, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; See, holiness brought about a separation there. there was holiness and men and women were dedicated and consecrated to the Lord &gt;&gt; throughout the years. Uh the devil has made holiness to be about the works of man and and um where men base destination of their soul uh on their works which is legalism &gt;&gt; and we know that to be facts &gt;&gt; and uh John Wesley is the one that brought in uh uh sanctification the message of holiness &gt;&gt; and uh they they didn't wear rings, they didn't wear necklaces, they didn't, you know, I mean, they had strict strict rules uh uh in what they would consider uh holiness to be. Now, uh which brought forth uh uh legalism. And the word legalism is strict literal or excessive conformity to the law or to a religious or moral code. See, and so it's it's basically the same thing that they did under Moses's law. &gt;&gt; The law of Moses, they serve God by merit of what they did uh what they did or didn't do. And and and so brother Bram says, "See, in the world today, uh uh where all these ism, this is rises up, watch on all the cults, cults of nonmeat eating and illegalist that I've got to do so and so. And if I don't speak with tongues, if I don't do this, if I don't shout, if I don't dance, then there's something wrong with me." That's legalism. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? So they serve God by merit and and so but but we we understand that that uh legalistic disposation uh uh ended when when Christ who was the true real royal seed of Abraham he he come to the earth and the prophet said he took all the legalism upon himself and paid the price of redemption and God's church is back in grace again. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad for that? &gt;&gt; See, so then uh we as the uh uh the true seed of Abraham, we're we're under grace. Christ put us back under grace and not under the law to where I don't have to gain God's favor. I don't have to try to appease an angry God. His anger has already been been appeased &gt;&gt; through Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; So the prophet said he taken the law upon himself and the law nailed him to the cross of what we must do and must not do and must do and must not do. So our salvation is not everybody say is not based on our works. &gt;&gt; Our salvation is not based upon our works. And that's exactly what Satan calls holiness to be as is it it became a law. It became a works. It become it become trying to sanctify people, get people safe and by what they did and what they didn't do and and before you know it, it's it's like the uh uh the strict religions of the Muslims and all that long garments and you know and and pious and and and uh uh uh you know, you've got the uh monks that they they they dedicate themselves to to a certain religion and and and they stay to themselves and they stay, you know, and they they penalize themselves and and they punish themselves and the nuns punish themselves and everybody's punishing themselves trying to be holier, trying to gain God's freedom, a favor and and all of these things. Well, that's not what holiness is about. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hello. Right? &gt;&gt; So we find that there is nothing that a man can do to save himself. You're already saved by grace. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; The prophet said, "You can't stop eating meat. You can't stop doing this or that. You cannot stop. Christ saves you and that alone." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? According to the Bible, you can't even come to him unless he first chooses you to come. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; So God elected and called Abraham before he done one good thing. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Before he done anything to gain God's favor or what we would call that would gain God's favor, if there was anything that he could do, he didn't do that. And yet he still had God's favor. &gt;&gt; God called him and chose him. Elected him. Ain't that right? The prophet said God called him and said that through him he was going to make him a father of nations. No matter what you do, Abraham, you don't have to do one thing. I've done it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So that tells us that the promise is a sure thing. &gt;&gt; Amen. Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; Did God blindly choose Abraham? No. &gt;&gt; No. What if What if God said, "Well, I'm going to choose Abraham and give him my promise." And then he goes down there and tells Abraham to separate himself and from his kindred and to leave that land that he and everything that he's known and go to a a place he's never known before, never seen before and all that. And then Abraham says, "No, I don't think I'm going to do it. I'm going to live right here in the land of her. If you've got anything to say or do for me, uh uh you just got to do it here. What What if God would have done that? What if Abraham would have responded to God in that way? Ain't that right? See? Amen. Then what what would have God done? See what what would God do then? If Abraham just bucked and balked and says, "I'm not interested. Uh you just go do your thing." And and uh yeah, cuz I ain't going to separate. Well, you see, God would have never done such a thing like that. Ain't that right? See, God knows all things. Everybody say, "God knows all things." &gt;&gt; Acts 15:18, "Known unto God are all his works from the beginning of the world." Notice Romans 8:29. For whom he did forno. Everybody say forno. who he did forno. When did he forneew them? Before the foundation of the world, he also did predestinate. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? In Romans 11 and two, Paul speaks of Israel declaring that God hath not cast away his people which he forneew. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? So then he already forneew Abraham. He knew all about Abraham. very acquainted with the the least uh details of Abraham. Amen. And the prophet said, "God by election chose Abraham for he knew what Abraham would do." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? Another place God didn't call Abraham because he was a good man, but God knew what Abraham would do. So this this uh uh uh you know we were again raised in Pentecost among the apostolics and and um now you know no long no no short sleeve men couldn't wear short sleeves couldn't wear beards mustaches you know uh their their sideburns had to be a certain length couldn't wear their hair in the middle guys couldn't do that to wear couldn't wear certain colors Um, no, no. Uh, some of them didn't wear wedding rings. Uh, um, you know, um, you know, then the ladies had to have a a certain style of of dress and all this. But I remember I remember men and women both going around the outside of church when no one's looking and they're sneaking televisions in and and there women are slightly trimming their hair just to see what they can get away with. Or if they couldn't trim the hair, they would burn the hair. They they would do whatever it took. And then if they ever got caught, well, I didn't cut my hair. See, I I I uh you know, and I remember even even the girls, you know, when they're going out uh uh uh out away from home and and doing they're slipping pants on and and putting a little makeup on when they're away from mom and dad and and oh, it was a lot of stuff. What did it do? It was a holiness trying to keep people together. Amen. It became a legalism and yet it done nothing but cause people to rebel. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Is that not what the law of Moses done? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, come on, church. &gt;&gt; That's true. &gt;&gt; You Bible readers ought to know what it exactly done. It caused rebellion. They became rebels. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen. &gt;&gt; They're the one that wanted the law. They're the one that says, "Hey, we can live it. You just bring it on, puppy. We'll we'll live it. I don't care how holy it is. I don't care how strict it is. We got it together and they became rebels. &gt;&gt; Because they couldn't live it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hello. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They couldn't. &gt;&gt; Amen. They couldn't live it. See, and so God knew, see, that Abraham would would would separate from his kindred. God knew that Abraham would leave his home. God knew, Amen. that he would turn his back on idolatry and all of these things. Brother Brham said God knew that Abraham would raise his children to fear the Lord. &gt;&gt; So God wasn't gambling a man upon Abraham. He knew Abraham. He knew more about Abraham than Abraham knew about himself. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yeah. God knew that if Abraham had the chance, a man, to follow after God, he would. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said, "Oh, there's so much of this legalism today. Touch not, taste not. You don't do things legally. I didn't come to this church tonight legally. I feel tired. I've been nervous. I'm upset. I'm wondering about something that's out before me. My heart's burning even as such as much till my heart's a fluttering. I got a cramp pain right at this minute. Just shooting back and forth up and down through here. Weak, nervous, trembly. Amen. Catch a hold here and squeeze. Got my toe squeezed up in my shoes. I felt anything but coming down here. Why did I come then? Because I love God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Can you say &gt;&gt; amen? &gt;&gt; Live or die, I must stand here for him. It's not because I have to. He wouldn't care about whether I did or not. If I die, I'd go to heaven anyhow. But I'm coming because I love him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You serve God because you love him, not because you just got to do it. I I think sometimes people focus more on things that God's not really concerned about. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And we make it a thing of salvation, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Hello. &gt;&gt; And you know, men and women or or ministers have and and and well, men, women, both, they they have injected their own ideas of what holiness ought to be. And then when they see people not living up to their own standards, well, they can't be a Christian. They can't be this. They're wrong. And and then we say, just like what law would do, law demands justice. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes. &gt;&gt; Now in Colossians 1:9 through10, Paul says that he says, "We do not cease to pray for you and to desire that you be filled with the knowledge of his will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding, that you walk that ye might walk worthy of the Lord unto all pleasing." &gt;&gt; Amen. being fruitful in every good work and increasing not in my knowledge, &gt;&gt; not in your knowledge, &gt;&gt; but in the knowledge of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; Now, first John 3:21, beloved, if our &gt;&gt; heart condemnth not, if our heart condemnth not, then we have confidence toward God. &gt;&gt; Hello. Amen. &gt;&gt; I I think that's important because every son and daughter of God will have a condemnation in their own heart if they're wrong. &gt;&gt; It don't take someone down the street to condemn you. &gt;&gt; God will condemn you in your own heart. Your own heart condemns you &gt;&gt; when when you're not living right. and and the the the the preacher walks on down your avenue or you hear the prophet talk about something that you're struggling with, there's something down inside of you that just pricks your soul. &gt;&gt; I'm not right. &gt;&gt; Most people, they get mad. &gt;&gt; Yeah. when uh they get their what we call their toes stepped on. Well, he's preaching against me. He knows all about me. So, I Yeah, I get it. No, maybe it's just God trying to talk with you. &gt;&gt; And if there's something there, &gt;&gt; help us, God. &gt;&gt; We ought to just thank God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Bram says, if you've got a heart to serve God, you ought to cherish that. Amen. &gt;&gt; Every day of your life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Cuz not everybody has that. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Not everybody's able to hear something of God and be pricked in their soul. Most people are hearing that they're okay. &gt;&gt; Right. So if there's something that's pricking your heart, then you ought to just humble yourself and say, "God, whatever it is, I just want to be right." &gt;&gt; So if our heart condemnth, not though, then we have confidence toward God, and whatsoever we ask, we receive of him. Why? because we keep his commandments and do those things that are pleasing in his sight. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God has called us to a life of separation and a full obedience. And one of these scriptures, and I'm going to get more into it uh later, the Lord willing, but Deuteronomy 22:5, the woman, everybody say the woman, &gt;&gt; shall not wear that which pertainth unto a man. &gt;&gt; Neither shall a man, everybody say a man, &gt;&gt; put on a woman's garment. &gt;&gt; For all that do so are abomination unto the Lord thy God. &gt;&gt; That's right. So, do you do you know, young people, it is an abomination. It is not just a choice. It's an abomination to God. &gt;&gt; When a woman puts on pants, &gt;&gt; I don't care where church they go to. I don't care if they sing in the choir. I don't care if they talk about God every day of their life. &gt;&gt; If that woman puts on pants, it's an abomination to the very God that she claims to serve. So, don't be disillusioned when you seeing all these women up there in their little pants, cute little pants or whatever they got and they're worshiping God and they're leading the the choir or they're in the musicians or they're dancing and they're shouting and they're woo and they're talking about God and they love God and and all that. Remember what the Bible says. &gt;&gt; It's an abomination for a woman to wear pants. Amen. &gt;&gt; You say that's being judgmental. Well, God help us by the Bible to be that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We're not condemning nobody, but there has to be a separation. &gt;&gt; Hello. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They're truth. &gt;&gt; So, we're not judging people in the in the s that's between us them and God. But what we're saying is that I don't want my daughters wearing pants. And I don't want them getting confused by somebody else wearing their pants and claiming to love God and claiming to have an anointing and claiming all of that and now they're just sat here confused. I want them to understand it's still an abomination. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's true. It's an abomination for a man to to put on a pair of shorts. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know that &gt;&gt; it's an abomination. &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; Why? Because you'll only find it at a prophet. Hearing a prophet. He said that's women's undergarments. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I don't care how they do them up. Right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I don't care how they have made him to look manly. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; A prophet says it's wrong &gt;&gt; for a man to wear shorts. &gt;&gt; Whether you're doing it at the beach or whether you're doing it in the pool, where wherever, it's wrong to put on a woman's undergarment. &gt;&gt; It's just as much as abomination as it is for a woman to put on pants. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Now the the common argument that people use today is well that both men back in the in the Bible days they wore robes. Men and women wore robes and they were all the same. You will never get me to believe that nonsense. if God would require a people that he called out and made for himself to be a holy people and he told them a woman should not wear that which pertainth to a man and a man shouldn't wear that that pertainth to a woman and here they all wear the same kind of material or the same kind of garments. That's nonsense. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. &gt;&gt; I don't know much of the history but I promise you this. There was a difference. There was a difference. Amen. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So we we find that it is a spirit of unbelief that explains the word through reasoning. Another one first Corinthians 11:3. But I would have you know that the head of every man is Christ and the head of the woman is the man and the head of Christ is God. Try to tell that to the women in society today. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It also goes on to tell us that a woman is not to cut her hair. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And that a man is not to have long hair. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; Amen. And and I I'll you know, we've talked about it years ago, but we'll go into it as we go along as to why this uh uh is to be. But parents, we've got to teach our children the way of holiness. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; We're we're living in a dark age. I get it. We're living in the most evil age and we're living in the most deceptive age. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And spirits are flo every one of us are spirit beings as the prophet taught us. We can catch spirits. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; We can catch one another's spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? Yeah. &gt;&gt; See, so then we've got to we've got to make sure that we teach our children the way of holiness. And the only way of holiness is a Bible holiness. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; It's not what I think to be holiness. It's not what you think to be holiness. It's not what the neighbor down the street thinks to be holiness. It's what God considers to be holiness. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, 2 Corinthians 6:14, "Be ye not," everybody say, "Be ye not." &gt;&gt; Be not &gt;&gt; unequally yolked together with unbelievers. &gt;&gt; For what fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness? And what communion hath light with darkness? And what concord hath Christ with? And or what part hath he uh uh that believeth with an infidel? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; See, what agreement hath the temple of God with idols? &gt;&gt; For you are the temple of the living God &gt;&gt; as God has said. Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; You are a temple made for deity. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's why people raise up temples. Go to India. Go, go all these other places. There's temples that is erected to put their gods in. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? Well, you're the temple that should be consecrated to one God, and that's the living God. &gt;&gt; You're the temple that should be dedicated only to the living God, the one true living God. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? So we we find he says, "For you are the temple of the living God, as God hath said, I will dwell in them and walk in them, and I will be their God, and they shall be my people. Wherefore, as we've read, come out from among them, and be ye separate, sayith the Lord. Touch not the unclean thing, and I will receive you, and will be a father unto you, and you shall be my sons and daughters, sayeth the Lord Almighty." Amen. &gt;&gt; So, do not do not Everybody say, "Do not &gt;&gt; yoke up yourself with unbelievers." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What is an unbeliever? One that denies the word. &gt;&gt; They can go to church and still deny the word. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; Remember Jehoshaphat, he did that. He made an alliance with Ahab. Uh, and they went out to war without consulting the Lord. The prophet said Jehoshaphat knew better than to do that. He knew better than to go out with Ahab. He knew better than to go out to war without consulting God first. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? But why did he not do that? Why didn't he come consult the Lord? Because he come under the influence of unbelievers. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; That's what a prophet said. He said, "And that's the way you do when you get mixed up with unbelievers. You claim your healing here and go outside and somebody say, "Oh, it's nonsense. There's nothing to it. Don't believe that. That's psychology." Well, they're saying that in the message now. That's psychology. You're just mentally worked up. Look out. Right there is the biggest danger line you've ever hit. &gt;&gt; You separate yourself from that person right then. have nothing else to do with them at all. Nothing. But how do you do? &gt;&gt; Yeah, &gt;&gt; you can be kind. &gt;&gt; Don't be snobby and a jerk. &gt;&gt; Father. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hello. &gt;&gt; See, but but he says if they want to be led to the Lord, then you do so. Lead them to the Lord. But keep yourself away from unbelief. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen, brother. &gt;&gt; You listening? &gt;&gt; There's got to be holiness unto the Lord. He said, "You go into a church and watch the way that minister behaves himself. His congregation will do the same thing." It's exactly right. You just watch it. Go into a church and watch the way the pastor teaches and what he does. It's that spirit, the kindred spirit. So, let's stay among believers. Let's stay where we belong and don't get on Satan's ground. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? Amen. &gt;&gt; You see, today the problem is the world wants mixers and and it's sad to say the church is okay with it. Church wants to be mixers. We don't want to stand out. We want don't want to be too odd. So, let's just mingle, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham would say it this way. &gt;&gt; He said, "It ain't how close you can walk to sin without sinning." &gt;&gt; That's right. It's how far you can stay away from it. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; That's it right there. &gt;&gt; People usually that hang around together, he says why they have fellowship with each other when they got things in common. I think it's strange when a person claims to be a Christian and they'd rather hang out with sinners than they would the church folks. &gt;&gt; I just think that's weird. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Because the company you hang out with. &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; Is the ones you've got fellowship with, &gt;&gt; the ones you've got more in common with. &gt;&gt; Hello. &gt;&gt; Well, sure. See, so if you've got things in common, like little children, they play with each other. Why? They've have things in common. But another place, after you once join yourself up with an unbeliever, you kindly take on his ways if you don't watch. &gt;&gt; And I want you to I want you to listen, young people, those of you that are going to these public schools, &gt;&gt; you may not have that opportunity to go to homeschool. I wish you did. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; But sometime mom has to work or or uh or whatever. And so, you know, she ain't got that time that she would want to to invest in in your schooling and things like that. Number thing that we keep our children and and and I I I want you you young people going to the public schools is the there are spirits out there. &gt;&gt; There are spirits that are trying to take you and dominate you and take you to hell. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Yeah. Amen. &gt;&gt; You're you're around that all the time. Girls wearing shorts. &gt;&gt; Maybe you're seeing the girls and the guys kissing one another. &gt;&gt; Maybe they're hugging one another &gt;&gt; and you're seeing this constantly on a daily basis. &gt;&gt; And and and you're seeing them act unseemingly. If you don't know what the Bible says about it, you'll think that's okay. &gt;&gt; Preach. &gt;&gt; Hello. And a lot of times they're claiming to believe the same Bible you believe. They're believing to be a Christian. Everybody just about believes to be a Christian. &gt;&gt; Everybody says they're okay. Everybody says they're going to heaven these days. Why? Because there's no holiness. &gt;&gt; Come on, brother. &gt;&gt; There's no separation. &gt;&gt; And the church has long lost that holiness &gt;&gt; to where we just look and say, "Well, everybody's okay. What's right? What's wrong? &gt;&gt; And then the preacher looks bad when he's But what about mom and dad should be teaching this to their children? &gt;&gt; Don't you kiss a boy unless you're married. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; That still stands today. But we put the TVs. We put movies up. Amen. And our children are watching them. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. Preach. &gt;&gt; Slopping and kissing. Committing adultery. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm sure you've heard it. It's become big news of the CEO uh that got caught on the camera. They were at a concert and a kissing camera, you know, shown right upon him and he had his arms around her and they saw that they were discovered and he he ducked down. Man, he he's hiding. She was over there, you know, and the guy that was doing the concerts. Oh, what's what do we have here? They're either committing adultery &gt;&gt; or they're very shy people. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Found out that, you know, that was his secretary and &gt;&gt; Oh, &gt;&gt; he's married, got a wife somewhere else with two boys. &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; And he's over there with another woman, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And the world is just beating them up. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Both got fired. Oh, &gt;&gt; from their jobs over it. &gt;&gt; Now, you know, here's my deal, though. I'm thinking, why is the world making such a fight? &gt;&gt; That's true. That's true. &gt;&gt; People are doing this every day. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; They're hypocrites. &gt;&gt; They're doing it every day. Their boys and girls are doing it every day. The prophet said, "The moment a boy kisses a girl and they're not married, that is potential adultery." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; They're committing adultery. I know that's not popular, but it's true. &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; Go ahead. &gt;&gt; Boys aren't to put their hands on girls. Girls ain't to to be be hugged by boys and and and and vice versa and all that without being married. &gt;&gt; It's wrong. &gt;&gt; But it's happening everywhere. So why pick on them? &gt;&gt; Yes, what they done was wrong. Yes, he's a he's a scumbag &gt;&gt; cheating on his wife. &gt;&gt; Right. Right. &gt;&gt; But if you really want to put it, Brother Bram talking about marriage and divorce. He says, "If I sent that tape everywhere else, it'd break up this nation." &gt;&gt; Everybody's doing it. &gt;&gt; But what's sad is when the church begins to do it. And so I want to tell you young people and you mothers and your dads ought to teach your young children that it's wrong to do them. &gt;&gt; Well, that might make them judgmental. I would rather them to stand there and know what's right and what's wrong &gt;&gt; than to be part of the scripture that says woe unto them that call evil good and good evil. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There's good people. &gt;&gt; No doubt they're good people. &gt;&gt; Hello. &gt;&gt; Amen, brother. &gt;&gt; But good people go to hell just as fast as the evil person does. &gt;&gt; Yeah, they do. &gt;&gt; So he says, see, after you once join yourself up with unbelievers, you kindly take on his ways if you don't watch. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Brandham says, "A man was talking to me the other day and he says, 'I don't know what I'm going to do. I had a good, honest boy, and that boy is getting, so he takes what he puts his hands on." I said, "Why?" The father says he's associating with a thief. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; See, you hang around with somebody that's a thief, you'll be a thief yourself. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Old Kentucky mammy used to say, "If you lay down with a dog that's got fleas, you'll get up with fleas, too." &gt;&gt; You take a woman that's no good and let a girl see a a good decent boy and the first thing you know, he's as honorary as a pup. Turn it right vice versa. You know, you are known by your company. So, separate yourself. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; I I understand that that that church has problems too. Every family here has got problems. &gt;&gt; All of our young people are not angels. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All of our you parents are not angels. &gt;&gt; And I get it. You know, we can look and it's so easy for for young parents that's got children to look at the other parents say, "Well, they ain't doing this and they ain't doing that." And what you don't realize every other young couple is looking at you and saying, "Well, I don't know why they let their children do this and I don't know why they're doing this and I don't know why they're doing that." See, we we can all find fault just amongst ourselves. But I would rather be amongst you than I would be amongst out there. Amen. With people that are a godless and don't know this message and don't believe this message. &gt;&gt; Hello. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. See, and and and and so if we're not careful, we become as Balum did when he looked at Israel and he looked at all the hinder parts and and and thought, "How in the world could a holy God put up with such a people like this?" &gt;&gt; But what he didn't realize is God had called these people holy unto himself. He had separated them not because they were perfect, not because they were sinless, &gt;&gt; because he loved them. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That's the truth. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; I hope this all right. &gt;&gt; So, Jehoshaphat being yolked up with believers, the prophet said he took the unbelievers away. And that's the way many spiritfilled Christians after revival falls because they yoke themselves up amongst people that said, "Well, I go to church. We're as good as the rest of them." Now, I want you to you young people, you probably got family that same way. I I go to church. Doesn't bother me to watch movies. We're okay. I love God. God just looks at the heart. That's the common thing that everybody says. Yeah. &gt;&gt; God looks at the heart. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; But we also know from the abundance of the heart, the mouth speaketh. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; See, and and and so uh um we we look at all these things, but he said, see, uh uh uh they yoke themselves up amongst people that said, "Well, I go to church. We're as good as the rest of them." And you lose your experience. I hope it's all right. &gt;&gt; This way I feel, so I'm fine with it. &gt;&gt; You might have got an experience at our tent meeting to where you cried and you just felt God. But you can lose that experience. And don't you forget that. &gt;&gt; You can lose that experience by hanging around with unbelievers. That's right. &gt;&gt; You You can get an experience today where you just feel God and you feel broken and and God just moves and you just cry and and you you're under that presence. Amen. And God is actually doing something for you. But you can lose that when you're going out there and letting your friends, amen, be unbelievers and that's all you're hanging out with and they don't know about miracles of God. They ain't looking for a rapture. They ain't looking for. They're interested in sports. They're interested in the movie. They're interested in some gal or girl. Amen. That that has no convictions whatsoever of God. Amen. And if you're hanging around that, you'll lose your experience. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So he says, stay right in the word road. Stay right in the road. No matter what the rest of them does, you know where you belong. You know who you belong to. Stay right under the power of prayer all the time. Don't let them call you off to something else in amusements and so forth, saying, "Well, there's no harm in this, and if there's a question, don't do it. Stay away from it." &gt;&gt; Hello. Amen. &gt;&gt; And and and and parents, if our children are not able to stand up for themselves, then don't allow them. &gt;&gt; Sure. &gt;&gt; Stand for them. [Music] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I thank God for a dead that would do such a thing. Now, the prophet said in another place, "Don't mix Mary." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hello. &gt;&gt; Oh, yeah. We're talking about holiness. a separated people unto the Lord. Don't mix Mary. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; Marry a boy that believes just exactly like you do. For after all, God is the main important thing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That we are here in the earth to do is to serve him. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; That's right. See, and if you do marry or anything contrary to that, you'll pay for it in the days that lays ahead of you. You must always remember it's by faith and not by sight. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? And and I know I I I know boys and girls, they get all giddy around one another and and they think they fall in love and they think this and they think that and and uh you know, a boy can swoo a girl uh big time and and and girls can dress in such a way that that they sexy and they appeal to you and you think you're in love and and all of these things and and all this, but remember, God is the main thing in your life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hello. You can be all giddy and and and and all these goosebumps when you're around a boy or around a girl and and all that, but remember when marriage when you marry that person, all that leaves. &gt;&gt; Hello. &gt;&gt; That's exactly right. And then you're set there and then you got to think now. What am I going to do about my family? What am I going to do about my children? &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. See, so so think now &gt;&gt; plan. &gt;&gt; I've always, you know, told my children, you know, think, pray now. What do you want in a girl? What do you want in a boy? &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; What do you want that special person in your life to be? &gt;&gt; Right? while you're sober, while you're not intoxicated with feelings and and and goosebumps and and uh your hormones going wacko. Just think, &gt;&gt; what is it that I want? &gt;&gt; What is it kind of a home do I want my home to be? What what what do I want my children to be raised in? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And then stay with that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Pray for that right one. &gt;&gt; Amen. Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; Stay with it. And then when all the the the goosebumps and he makes me feel good and and and she just Oh, she's the perfect one. Think about what you've been asking God. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's the truth. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And then be sober. &gt;&gt; And pray. Brother said, "Pray, pray, pray." &gt;&gt; That's right. Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; It's &gt;&gt; like brother George Smith says, there's a lot worse things than being single. &gt;&gt; There's a lot worse things to be in &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; than being single. Cuz once you get married, that's it, buddy. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, Brother Brandham, another place, watch how you make your alliance. Watch what you're doing. how you yoke yourself up with unbelievers. Keep Everybody say keep &gt;&gt; yourself &gt;&gt; clean. &gt;&gt; Especially in the day that we're living. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; Keep yourself clean, especially in the day that we're living. And I will tell you, social media has opened the door to all kinds of evil things. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; You love the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, we find as I get ready to close, the majority of people today have this idea that separation isn't a part of Christianity and they think that if the promise is unconditional, which it is, then they don't have to do anything. But, but what they failed to see is the promise is to those who God knew would want it. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Hello. &gt;&gt; See, like brother Brandham says, before there was a world, you were in God's thoughts to give you the Holy Ghost because he knew you'd be wanting it. &gt;&gt; Now, we didn't know right now, but God knew. &gt;&gt; We might have been content with the world. We might have been doing whatever. We're searching for things and we just didn't know. But God knew you. &gt;&gt; Amen. And God knew that if ever given a chance, &gt;&gt; you would take it. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hello. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; So God knew you would want it before you even knew you wanted it. &gt;&gt; Yeah, &gt;&gt; that's true. &gt;&gt; So he said, see, he knew you'd be wanting it. And he chose you himself because you desired. See, he chose you in Christ before you or Jesus any of you was on the earth. And he sent Jesus to die to prepare the way to send the Holy Ghost to bring you to himself. &gt;&gt; So God when he called Abraham, he was not trying to do get Abraham to do something against his will. &gt;&gt; True, brother. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Abraham was willing to go to another land. Abraham was willing to forsake his idolatry. Abraham was willing. See, he readily accept God's will for his life. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, there are people who just refuse to repent and admit that they're wrong. They justify their actions and their words and thoughts and and before you know it, it just becomes a battle. It becomes just a uh you know, against God's word. and and and because they're not they're not wanting to just surrender. &gt;&gt; They're not wanting to give up. And and so that's where you become people become rebels in the church. And and if you're not careful, it becomes then it becomes legalism. I want to tell you the promises of God are to those who want them promises. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? And the promises and and and holiness is for those who want holiness. &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; When God calls a people to separate, there ain't this, well, I'm I I don't I just go down to the next church. &gt;&gt; Oh, &gt;&gt; it ain't that way. &gt;&gt; It's people that really are ready to surrender. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I'll tell you, church, we'll be surrendering all of our lives. Paul says, "I die daily." &gt;&gt; That's right. That's right. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; See, so so if it's against God's word, we must repent of it and separate ourselves from it. Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; Now, did did Abraham make mistakes? Yes. Did Did Abraham uh failed to obey at times? Yes. The prophet said he even backslid. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; But I want to ask you, was God disappointed in Abraham? No. &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; Right. See, Abraham wasn't perfect in as as as in sinless, right? &gt;&gt; He was under grace, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And God had made an unconditional covenant. And that's the only way God could keep his promise to Abraham. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? The children of Israel wasn't perfect either. We saw their ups and downs. We saw their backslidings. And we saw the things like that. Uh uh but notice what God said in Numbers 23:21. He hath not beheld iniquity in Jacob. Neither hath he seen p uh perverseness in Israel. The Lord his God is with him and the shout of a king is among them. Can you say amen? Well, how can that be? a people that is was was sinful, a people that had their ups and downs. Uh uh Abraham backslid, lied, and and all of these things. Well, the prophet said there was a brazen serpent going before them. There was a pillar of fire. There was an atonement to take away that sin that was on Israel. It was election. God was going to take them through. Yes or no? God's give the uh covenant unconditional. I'll save Abraham and his seed. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Oh, do you love him? &gt;&gt; So, we find that the color red is a sign of danger to us. But yet, the color red is a sign of redemption. Redemption, red is redemption color to God. &gt;&gt; It means redemption. And and redemption comes through red through the shedding of the blood. The Bible says without the shedding of blood, there is no remission of sins. Ain't that right? In the Old Testament, God required a heer. That heer had to be red, a red heer, solid red, no spots in it or or whatever. And and and brother said, perfectly red because God looks through red. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? God looks through red. He chose red to look through blood. Amen. And and so Isaiah 1:18, God says, "Come now and let us reason together, sayeth the Lord. Though your sins be as scarlet, they'll be white as snow. Though they be red like crimson, they'll be as shall be as wool." Ain't that right? So the prophet tells us, and you go look it up and try it. When you when you look at red through red, it's white. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? So when God looks at us a a uh uh that is red uh scarlet red from our sins and and all of that when he looks through the blood of Christ and looks at us. Amen. All he sees is white. &gt;&gt; God God provided something that would separate us from our sins. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. It's not a people that is rebellious. I'm going to live in old way. And so God says, "Okay, yeah, you go ahead. I still love you. You're my you're my babies and and you know, all these things." No. God would choose a people that that is full of mistakes that that that you know that that that fail many times, but the heart is saying, "God, I want to serve you. I I Yeah. Oh, I hope you understand. You see, how could we separate ourselves from sin? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How could we separate? &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right. &gt;&gt; You know, the prophet said, God looking through the blood, he doesn't see you no more as a sinner. He sees you redeemed. &gt;&gt; You're redeemed because he always sees you through Christ. That's the reason we can be perfect. Not perfect in the sense of sinless. We're perfect in the eyes of God when we're in Christ. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Oh, do you love him? Amen. God tried to get make a covenant, a a a conditional covenant with man and man broke it. And the prophet says man just can't keep his promise to God because his adversary is too great. &gt;&gt; And I want to tell you something. Our adversary is too great &gt;&gt; to try to do it on our own. We can't do it. &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; Why? We were all born with a sinful nature, a carnal nature. We all know these things. Amen. And and because we have this sinful nature, we have sinful desires. Our desires are lustful. Our our desires are evil. Our desires are sinful. You understand what I'm saying? Amen. And because we have that sinful nature, we're under the devil's control. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; So, we have no holiness. We can try to act holy and try to obtain holiness, but it only makes us hypocrites. &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right. &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; The Apostle Peter taught us to add faith, virtue, knowledge, temperance, patience, brotherly kindness, charity. Taught us to do this. Brother Brandham talked about it in the message, Stature of a Perfect Man. And he said, "There's some people that have a portion of this that don't even pretend to be Christians, but that won't do it. It's like a black bird trying to put on peacock feathers in his wings. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To make him a peacock. He only disgraces himself. Be better to stay a black bird. And when he tries to exercise these things without being a Christian, he's just simply all out of place. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Brown says another place, the devil is religious and he can put on a very much pious and holiness actions, &gt;&gt; but God looks on the heart. &gt;&gt; Amen. Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, we find that God had to do the separation because as Paul said, they that are of the flesh do mind the things of the flesh and and and all of these things. If if you're a duck, you like water, right? &gt;&gt; If you're a pig, you like you like to wallow in the mud. If you're a buzzard, you you like to eat dead things. It's it's your nature. And brother Brandham said, if you're a devil, you'll like the things of the world. If you're a Christian, you'll like Christ. &gt;&gt; So, where are you at today? You claiming to be up here eating the things of the Lord and then going down and rooting with the devil. There's something wrong with that. Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; See, so so God had to do the separation. God had to do the calling out. He couldn't say, "Brother Bill, I've I've I require you to separate yourself, but if you've got that sinful nature, you ain't going to be able to do it. you'll start being able to live and tow the line as far as on the outward amen side. But down inside, there's still something there that's craving these things. So, there's not been a true separation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; A minister, Brother Brand was talking to a certain minister uh or about a Yeah. talking to a certain minister and he was telling him about another pastor that asked his congregation to sign a pledge that uh they would at least attend Sunday school for 6 months out of the year. &gt;&gt; And he sent out 500 cards to his congregation and he said only two cards come back two committed. And they're at a restaurant and Brother Brown's talking while their waitress was excited about this dance that she was going to go to when she got off work. And I think there was on the radio. They were advertising it and uh this about this dance that was to take place tonight and the DJ said they would be there and and all that and playing songs and all that. And so she was excited. And brother Brown said this little girl started, you know, across the floor hollering, "Todoodle deod." And said they was going to have some kind of an old barn swing dance or something or another. And she got down there to that radio and she throwed a kiss to the guy through the radio. So excited she didn't know I was at the door. And she said, "You know, to honey, I'll see you there tonight." And I thought, "Yeah, it's true. You'll be there. No doubt at all. You'll be there." And she walked over and she kept going around the floor hollering, you know, and like she was dancing. And she said, "Oh, excuse me." She said, "I I just love to dance." So, well, Brother Ram said, "I noticed that." And she said, "Oh, I just love it." He said, "Well, I believe that." So, he looked at that minister after this minister was, you know, or about his congregation. And he said, "You think that girl, you think that girl would have to be made to sign a card to go out to that old barn tonight for that dance?" &gt;&gt; Now, you wouldn't have to get her to sign a card to agree &gt;&gt; cuz it's down inside of her. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham said, "See, it's it's because in her heart is a spirit that feeds on that." &gt;&gt; Ain't that right? &gt;&gt; That's right. And he said, "See, if a man's born of God, when the church bell rings, you can't stay away from it. There's something on the inside that calls you that out, the deep calling to the deep." See, you've got to go. You've got to get right here, brother. If that spirit in there is still worshiping the world, the love of God's not even in you. Can you say amen? So in other words, in order for there to be true holiness, God has to do the separation &gt;&gt; from the soul. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Inside out. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I pray that this helped you today. But I I I do pray that you young people, all of us, but you young people really see the need for God to separate you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Down into your heart to where you say, "God, circumcise my heart." &gt;&gt; Yes. Yes. &gt;&gt; Cuz that's the only way you're going to survive. That's right. &gt;&gt; Just to be honest. And you &gt;&gt; I pray that God does that to my children. I've prayed that through all for all of my children. But I pray that for you children, you parents that got children. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because the world is so strong, the pull of the world is so real. &gt;&gt; Oh yes. &gt;&gt; That there could be holiness. &gt;&gt; God make us holy. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's not that you again, it's not a sinless perfection. It's that the blood covers you. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; You're walking doing his will. You've got that desire. The desire is gone from the world. &gt;&gt; The the girls can't attract you no more. The worldly boys can't attract you no more. The worldly things can't attract you. &gt;&gt; The the attraction just ain't there. You used to love movies. You used to love television. It's just not there no more. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You used to love just spending your time with with in things that just was ungodly, not right. But it's just not there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What is it? God has separated you. &gt;&gt; He's brought a holiness to you. &gt;&gt; Why? Because he's going to use you &gt;&gt; for his glory. &gt;&gt; His glory. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? You love him? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If the musicians will come. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. We love &gt;&gt; a true separation. And this is what the people of God have come to is a separation. It's not that we got the tape measure out. It's not that we're over here checking everybody, making sure they're doing good, and putting our nose in everybody's business. That's Now, I'm going to tell you, that's just that's just the way it is with legalism. Everybody's got their eye on everybody. But we find out it takes God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And that shows the true election. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Is that when God comes knocking on the heart, there's something that responds, God, that's what I want. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I want to be that. &gt;&gt; And if you're having struggles with things, that's just where you lay your life at the altar and say, "God, &gt;&gt; I want more of you." &gt;&gt; Amen. I I just want more of you. I I I I want I want the old things to die. I want the world just to lose its hold. And I want to come more into you and what your plan is for my life. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let the world do what they want to do. &gt;&gt; But I'm separated. You've separated me. you you've caused me to come for this this purpose. The world ain't going to listen to the message. They don't want the message, but that's okay. It's for you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. to [Music] you. With all I have within me, I give you praise. [Music] And all that I adore [Music] is in you.

And I tell you what, I I think that's honorable when parents would come and just asking for God's wisdom. we realize just how sacred these things are and you know the words that we say our children need that and um and so they're just asking for all of our prayer here today is that we could just bind together that the spirit of wisdom would come upon them and just touch I know they've been praying for uh their son and as a parent I I know they're they're burdened for him and and things and and so we just want God to be there and not only to be here with them but to be on the other end dealing with that situation and the spirit of God just working. And so let let's just pray together. Father, &gt;&gt; oh God, &gt;&gt; here's an elderly &gt;&gt; couple. father, minister of the gospel and his wife and still give us grace &gt;&gt; just humble in their heart to ask for your guidance in this. &gt;&gt; Father, I pray that you would direct this their words and that their words would be inspired of you. May your presence just be in that place and let it be over there where where Brad is, God. Father, I pray Lord that you would just work a work God. That you would just move in this situation, Lord, and turn things around. Father, I pray that the desire would be there, Lord. And he would follow that desire to serve you and to consecrate himself to you, Father, as we see the time is drawing near, Lord. And oh father, we know that you're I just believe you're bringing the children in. Parents have been praying and seeking you and holding on. Father, oh God, let it be this time.

I want to reflect him to the sinner. I want God to so separate me from the world. That he could so use me. Amen. That's that's certainly my desire. And I know that's your desire for yourself as well. May God bless you. Keep one another in your uh prayers. Amen. remember uh prayer service tomorrow at 7:00 and u for those of you who can make it and um we want to keep sister Martha in our prayer and u Satan is really fighting her in her body and u doctors have not been able to find out at this point what's going on but we know we know ultimately it's the devil, but something's really happening and I know there she's a private person. She doesn't like a lot of attention to her, but she needs our prayers and so when you pray, pray for her that God will just help her. And I've heard that Sister Christa will be having u some kind of surgery tomorrow and so we want to keep her in our prayer as well. God will bring her through and give her a speedy recovery. Amen. And so I think that is it at this point. Uh brother Josiah and Judah will be coming home I think today or tomorrow. So we want to keep them in our prayers. they would be traveling. Amen. And so, um, also, uh, Brother Diego, I don't have my phone, but he's going to be having a meeting August, uh, 21st. I think it's 21st, 2nd, and 3rd, 23rd, somewhere's in there. And, uh, I'll try to get more information, but he would just be excited if any of us could go. they come here to ours. He helps him and his brother has helped us with the translation and brother Wayne uh will be ministering, brother Andrew Glover, uh brother uh Samuel Browning and then another his Hispanic brother. So, they'll all be ministering. So, uh I know you'll hear great word, hear the message, and um uh you'll you'll be blessed. And so if you're able to go, it's about 7 hours away. So um might be a little drive, but uh it'll be worth it if if you can go. So uh God bless you and let's just bow our heads in prayer. Levi, do you want to dismiss us in prayer? [Music]
