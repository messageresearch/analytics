[52:24] but thank you for your service and and
[52:27] and um uh raising your children amen and
[52:32] um uh Hebrews the 11th
[52:35] chapter and I'm just going to read
[52:41] the 23d verse by faith Moses when he was
[52:47] born was hid three months of his
[52:50] parents because they saw he was a proper
[52:54] child and they were not afraid
[52:57] of the king's commandment amen amen
[53:00] let's just bow our heads in a word of
[53:03] prayer Lord
[53:06] Jesus father we're so glad that we could
[53:09] come in your presence Lord this
[53:13] morning
[53:15] Father and we could call you our father
[53:20] knowing that we're your
[53:22] children and Lord we're just asking that
[53:25] you would just speak now now father help
[53:28] me to get myself out of the way pray
[53:31] Lord that um if there's any Sins not
[53:34] under the blood we'd ask that you'd
[53:35] forgive us all of our sins Lord and
[53:40] father May the word have its way here
[53:44] this morning and be able to draw us
[53:47] closer bless every mother this morning
[53:50] Father just with a special
[53:53] blessing we ask it in Jesus Christ's
[53:56] name
[53:58] amen you can be seated this
[54:03] morning and uh just to speak to your
[54:07] mothers for a few moments but um I guess
[54:12] if I would have a title it would be
[54:14] raising our children by
[54:17] faith and
[54:19] um I uh I believe that you mothers are
[54:23] are very
[54:25] special um you are
[54:28] Priceless even as you become more
[54:31] invaluable Priceless As Time
[54:35] continues uh the world is getting darker
[54:39] and it'll just continue to get more
[54:41] darker and you become more of a a
[54:47] jewel um in my in my
[54:51] estimation and um it is sad that
[54:55] Mother's Day has become
[54:58] commercialized um and uh it's kind of
[55:02] lost its
[55:03] meaning uh just just as anything uh
[55:07] Christmas and Easter it's you know it
[55:10] doesn't hold the value that it should
[55:12] have and it's all just become
[55:14] commercialized and things but I I I
[55:18] thank God uh for you
[55:20] mothers and and not just because you you
[55:25] raising your children children or you
[55:27] have raised but I appreciate the fact
[55:32] thatth you are raising them or have
[55:35] raised them to serve the Lord
[55:39] amen and but I go even further than just
[55:43] that because maybe many many mothers uh
[55:47] today have introduced uh what they uh
[55:52] would believe Christ to be and they've
[55:54] introduced their children to church or
[55:57] religion or whatever but I think what
[56:01] separates you and sets you apart is that
[56:03] you're not just telling your children of
[56:08] Christ of 2,000 years ago amen of what
[56:11] he done and how he lived and and things
[56:15] like that but uh and you're you're not
[56:18] just taking them uh to a history lesson
[56:22] in the Bible and and uh and that that's
[56:26] fine but uh uh to me you have recognized
[56:31] the day in which you have are living in
[56:35] amen and I think that's
[56:37] important amen um that uh uh that our
[56:42] children can be raised right not just by
[56:46] pointing them to scriptures and and
[56:48] telling them a history but to to
[56:52] recognize that that something is
[56:54] happening today amen but also not only
[56:59] have you recognized the day in which
[57:01] you're living in but you have also
[57:04] recognized uh the importance of your
[57:07] child being here in this age at this
[57:11] time amen and I I I think that's what
[57:15] separates you from any other other
[57:18] mother uh
[57:20] around uh and this is exactly what
[57:23] Moses's mother was able to do
[57:26] um uh she recognized uh the time that
[57:30] she was living in and she recognized the
[57:34] importance of her
[57:36] child uh uh for as as we we read that
[57:41] that both uh moses' parents saw that he
[57:44] was a proper child the prophet said they
[57:48] saw that their child was
[57:51] predestinated
[57:52] foreordained and was elected by God amen
[57:57] and and so this a lot of mothers that
[58:00] day uh in that age and and and having
[58:03] children and but this this couple this
[58:07] mother uh uh she she recognized value in
[58:13] in her child and and could place him
[58:18] strategically for the the age that they
[58:21] were living in and and that he wasn't
[58:24] just a a normal child just any child and
[58:28] and so she recognized that her her
[58:32] responsibility was greater amen because
[58:36] of the child that she had borne and and
[58:39] so uh uh you see both parents had been
[58:42] praying to God uh to send a deliverer
[58:46] and so the prophet said if you'll notice
[58:49] that their prayers was exactly with
[58:53] scriptures exactly with script R they
[58:56] had an understanding of scripture amen
[59:00] and and so their prayers was according
[59:03] to this the scriptures and I think if
[59:05] there's ever a a people that have an
[59:09] understanding of scripture it is us
[59:11] today amen far beyond any other age
[59:15] because the book has been open and our
[59:20] understanding has been made clearer it's
[59:23] it's it's it's it's it's it's a it's
[59:26] just Grace that we can take the
[59:28] scriptures and not look at it as as it
[59:31] has been looked at Through the Ages and
[59:33] so many millions are looking at this
[59:36] Bible in the same light that the other
[59:40] ages but the lamb has come forth and has
[59:43] opened the book to us and and so
[59:46] therefore our understanding is made
[59:49] clearer it requires a different action
[59:52] it requires a different way of life it
[59:55] requ re Ires a different prayer it
[59:58] requires different message it requires
[1:00:01] different action because now we have an
[1:00:04] understanding of the age we're living in
[1:00:06] we we have an understanding of what God
[1:00:09] is after we have an understanding of
[1:00:12] these not only for us not only for our
[1:00:14] church but for our children amen right
[1:00:19] amen so their prayers the prophet said
[1:00:22] were with the promised
[1:00:24] word see they weren't praying for God
[1:00:27] and if IID said in in our uh term today
[1:00:31] they weren't praying for God to send
[1:00:33] them you know an NBA star a NFL you know
[1:00:38] football player they they they weren't
[1:00:41] asking God to send them a genius they
[1:00:44] they weren't asking God to to make their
[1:00:47] child wealthy they were just praying
[1:00:51] according to what God had promised and
[1:00:54] and in that day God promised to send a
[1:00:57] deliverer ain't that right they they
[1:00:59] they they were looking for a deliverer
[1:01:01] and that was with what God had promised
[1:01:03] God had promise to deliver he didn't
[1:01:06] promise you know that that uh he would
[1:01:08] send a genius to them he didn't promise
[1:01:11] amen that he had send some uh uh
[1:01:13] Financial guide to them he promised them
[1:01:17] a
[1:01:18] deliverer and when they began to pray
[1:01:21] for a deliverer God answered their
[1:01:24] prayer and she become the mother of a
[1:01:27] deliverer Lord that's right she
[1:01:30] recognize and so you know we don't want
[1:01:34] to be like so many parents today who are
[1:01:37] praying against what God has promised
[1:01:39] for this day amen look we know by the
[1:01:43] message of the hour and again we're so
[1:01:46] blessed to have a prophet and to be
[1:01:48] setting under the message and to be able
[1:01:50] to believe it but we're living in a day
[1:01:53] where the world is falling apart how
[1:01:54] many believes that amen we're living in
[1:01:57] a day where God promised to shake not
[1:01:59] only the heavens or the Earth but the
[1:02:02] the heavens also is that right we're
[1:02:05] living in a day where that all all that
[1:02:08] can be shaken will be shaken and that
[1:02:12] which remains will remain we're living
[1:02:15] in that dayen th this has been promise
[1:02:19] after promise after promise now we're
[1:02:22] living here we can say this day these
[1:02:24] scriptures are being fulfilled
[1:02:26] right before our eyes we're living in a
[1:02:29] day where we we and I I'm saying we as
[1:02:33] the elect of God are receiving a kingdom
[1:02:37] that cannot be
[1:02:39] shaken do you believe that we're we're
[1:02:42] no longer looking at these scriptures
[1:02:43] and saying it's going to come it's going
[1:02:45] to come it's going to come it's
[1:02:47] happening and by the grace of God we can
[1:02:51] recognize what is taking place before
[1:02:54] our eyes this isn't something to play
[1:02:57] with this is something that is real it's
[1:02:58] it's happening it's it's scriptures that
[1:03:01] have been laying dormant for years and
[1:03:03] people have fussed about and argued
[1:03:05] about and tried to figure it out and
[1:03:07] it's happening right before us that's
[1:03:10] that's right we shouldn't pray for God
[1:03:14] to make our children something great in
[1:03:16] this world Amen we shouldn't even spend
[1:03:20] the efforts and time to try to make our
[1:03:23] children uh uh you to where they have a
[1:03:26] great name in this life so many people
[1:03:30] spending their time and investing their
[1:03:32] children into sports investing their
[1:03:35] children into schools investing their
[1:03:38] children into to to Hollywood investing
[1:03:41] their children and so many
[1:03:44] things you understand what I'm saying
[1:03:47] but we shouldn't pray for God to make
[1:03:50] our children something great I in in
[1:03:53] this world and and I'm not saying that
[1:03:55] they should be dumb and ignorant I ain't
[1:03:57] saying that at all but there's a
[1:04:01] promise there is a promise what good is
[1:04:04] it to have them to have
[1:04:07] wealth when we know that this world is
[1:04:09] falling apart the economy is
[1:04:13] sinking and there ain't no president
[1:04:15] that's going to help it there ain't
[1:04:17] nothing that's going to help this thing
[1:04:20] this ship is
[1:04:23] sinking amen Millions of people don't
[1:04:26] even know that but by God's grace we've
[1:04:28] been given a prophet to let us know the
[1:04:31] time the age that we're living in Amen
[1:04:35] in Matthew 24:12 Jesus speaks of this
[1:04:38] day and how do we know he speaks of this
[1:04:40] day because a prophet said it was for
[1:04:42] this day and and and and he speaks of
[1:04:45] this day saying because iniquity shall
[1:04:49] abound the love of many shall wax cold
[1:04:53] can you say amen and brother ad would
[1:04:56] say he says in this last age selflove
[1:04:59] selflove that's why you can't correct
[1:05:02] people anymore that's that's why you
[1:05:03] can't you you you you you can't get
[1:05:06] people to to involve themselves in the
[1:05:09] things of God because it's self-love if
[1:05:11] it's too hard for them they don't want
[1:05:12] to do it if it's too strous they don't
[1:05:14] want to do it they don't want to put any
[1:05:16] effort to the kingdom of God anymore a
[1:05:18] lot of people don't want to put effort
[1:05:20] to keep their marriage together a lot of
[1:05:21] people don't even want to put effort in
[1:05:23] in raising their children
[1:05:26] it's
[1:05:27] selflove ain't that right and love for
[1:05:30] material things will take the place of
[1:05:34] the true love of God so many excuses of
[1:05:37] why people can't come to church you know
[1:05:39] what people used to not do that then in
[1:05:41] in the days of to come but it happens in
[1:05:43] this day and it's actually to be
[1:05:46] accepted as the truth like we're
[1:05:48] supposed to believe this and to say
[1:05:51] anything contrary to it that everybody
[1:05:53] gets offended to it
[1:05:56] amen so many so so many things see but
[1:05:59] the love for material things will take
[1:06:01] the place of the true love of God we
[1:06:04] need to guard against the power of sin
[1:06:07] in these last days can you say Amen not
[1:06:10] only the preachers but fathers and
[1:06:13] mothers and and and lay members and and
[1:06:16] whoever you are we need to guard against
[1:06:19] this this this power of sin in these
[1:06:22] last days brother Bram goes on to say so
[1:06:25] many are getting so hard because they
[1:06:28] haven't realized the effect of this last
[1:06:30] day Spirit hello that's right so many
[1:06:34] are are getting so hard because they
[1:06:37] haven't realized the effect of this last
[1:06:39] day Spirit it is time to draw n to God
[1:06:42] everybody say it is time we we're not
[1:06:45] looking for another generation it's now
[1:06:47] it is time to draw near to
[1:06:52] God can you say Amen it ain't nothing to
[1:06:55] us to pass it on to another
[1:06:58] generation hello we got to recognize our
[1:07:01] day we're standing here recognizing the
[1:07:04] day that we're living in a prophet is
[1:07:07] telling us the day that we're living
[1:07:10] in amen it is time to draw nigh to God
[1:07:14] and let him fill our lives with his love
[1:07:16] or we will feel the coldness of the last
[1:07:18] day church and reject the truth of God
[1:07:21] which alone is able to help us can you
[1:07:24] say Amen brother brandham talked on the
[1:07:27] invasion of the United States and and
[1:07:30] our schools it's changed a the
[1:07:33] environment has so changed to where it's
[1:07:35] more easier to sin it's more easier to
[1:07:38] think corrupt it's more easier to deny
[1:07:41] the word of God it's because the
[1:07:43] environment has
[1:07:45] changed can you say amen amen see and
[1:07:48] and so uh uh you you see when an evil
[1:07:51] spirit comes in it creates its own
[1:07:54] environment yes it that's why people
[1:07:57] don't don't they don't recognize the
[1:07:59] spirit thereof they they can't humble
[1:08:01] themselves to the word there's something
[1:08:03] wrong that has created that type of an
[1:08:06] environment Christians always humble
[1:08:08] themselves to the word of God Amen do
[1:08:11] you believe that yes
[1:08:14] sir brother Braham says you take a man

[1:10:16] I can get the movies here until the
[1:10:18] television comes on then I'll get them
[1:10:20] and he sat down there and the people
[1:10:22] instead of shutting down the shows and
[1:10:24] not letting setting their children go
[1:10:26] they give them 10 cents on a Sunday
[1:10:28] afternoon and send them down there so
[1:10:30] they can have a little social party and
[1:10:33] be out to their C and ride around oh

[1:10:58] used to they got to have a job you
[1:11:00] understand what I'm saying and and and
[1:11:02] and to me it's a flat shame that girls
[1:11:04] have become in the message have become
[1:11:06] so career-minded amen more than just
[1:11:09] stand with what the prophet taught
[1:11:11] they're they're more career-minded
[1:11:12] they're worried about careers they're
[1:11:14] worried about and they always have this
[1:11:15] excuse well what if my husband amen uh
[1:11:18] uh uh what if he becomes ill amen and
[1:11:20] what about this why are you looking at
[1:11:22] all them things
[1:11:23] for didn't god promise to provide the
[1:11:27] needs amen see we're no longer living by
[1:11:30] faith anymore we're living by
[1:11:32] intellect
[1:11:34] amen it's a shame you know to see the
[1:11:37] young mothers pating their children off
[1:11:39] on someone else so that they can you
[1:11:42] know fulfill their their their career
[1:11:45] and and all these things brother Bram
[1:11:47] says it's such an hour of prostitution
[1:11:50] at hand the devil's done told them that
[1:11:52] they're the boss of the house talking
[1:11:54] about women they'll make their own way
[1:11:56] they'll do what they wish to and you get
[1:11:59] it out of them if you can he said
[1:12:02] there's only one thing you can uh that
[1:12:04] can get it out of them and that's the
[1:12:06] altar before Jesus Christ an
[1:12:08] oldfashioned tear streaming religion
[1:12:11] that'll break their hearts and tear them
[1:12:13] to pieces and make them what they ought
[1:12:16] to be the problem is people's hearts
[1:12:18] don't get hard uh soft anymore they
[1:12:20] don't cry they don't they they ain't
[1:12:22] broken up anymore and it's just the
[1:12:24] truth why the environment's
[1:12:27] changed can you say Amen it's just truth
[1:12:30] no wonder it's hard to be a real mother
[1:12:33] and and uh uh in this age to really
[1:12:36] teach your children the way of the
[1:12:38] message and the way that God wants them
[1:12:40] to be raised it is so hard and that's
[1:12:43] why I say you're more invaluable than
[1:12:44] you
[1:12:45] realize you're worth more than anything
[1:12:48] amen amen that's right and if you
[1:12:51] husband you got a mother like wife like
[1:12:54] that teaches your children you ought to
[1:12:56] respect them to the
[1:12:58] highest if you have a mother like that
[1:13:00] you ought to respect them amen but so
[1:13:03] many are living under the environment of
[1:13:05] this leodys and
[1:13:07] age but see Malachi 4 is the reason that
[1:13:12] we're not part of this
[1:13:14] amen see that God would set us
[1:13:18] apart go God would would he he he would
[1:13:22] put a distinguishing line between the
[1:13:26] world and his elect and that could only
[1:13:29] be by Malachi
[1:13:32] 4
[1:13:33] hello for Malachi 4:5 I'm going to read
[1:13:36] it we know it but behold I will send you
[1:13:39] Elijah the prophet for the coming of the

[1:13:45] hearts of the fathers to the children
[1:13:46] and the children of the uh the heart of
[1:13:49] the children to their fathers lest I
[1:13:50] come and smite the Earth with a curse
[1:13:53] now we know we know that this sixth
[1:13:54] verse was isn't fulfilled all at once uh
[1:13:57] uh it's got a two-fold uh uh purpose
[1:14:00] there John the Baptist was sent to turn
[1:14:02] the heart of the fathers to the children
[1:14:04] ain't that right Luke 1:13 but the angel
[1:14:08] said unto him fear not Zacharias for thy
[1:14:11] prayer is heard and thy wife Elizabeth
[1:14:13] shall bear thee a son and thou shalt
[1:14:15] call his name John 16th verse and many
[1:14:18] of the children of Israel shall he turn
[1:14:21] to the Lord God his message would turn
[1:14:24] them to the Lord Our God their God and
[1:14:28] he shall go before him in the spirit and
[1:14:31] power of Elias to turn the hearts of the
[1:14:34] fathers to the
[1:14:35] children hello so Malachi 4:6 is
[1:14:39] speaking of the two comings of Elijah

[1:20:13] will'll be the one everybody say we'll
[1:20:16] be the one not we'll be one of those but
[1:20:19] we'll be the one that'll take the church
[1:20:22] to the
[1:20:23] Rapture that's right are you with me
[1:20:28] now yes he will this is the age of
[1:20:31] rapture may we recognize our day now the
[1:20:35] world is preparing for
[1:20:37] tribulation that's
[1:20:40] right and the prophet says now they they
[1:20:42] have no hope they're going in
[1:20:45] Tribulation so what are they doing to to
[1:20:49] stoke to to stifle their fears comedy
[1:20:54] entertainment
[1:20:55] that's right the world putting her nose

[1:21:08] yourself in that you don't have to
[1:21:09] invest your time and all of
[1:21:13] that because that's not your
[1:21:16] lot God placed you under a message that
[1:21:19] if you had believe this message it'll
[1:21:21] take you
[1:21:22] home it'll take you it'll rra you out of
[1:21:25] here now if this is the age of rapture
[1:21:28] and we recognize the day that we're
[1:21:29] living in why would we as parents invest
[1:21:32] our children's time in
[1:21:34] politics why would we invest our
[1:21:36] children's time in television Hollywood
[1:21:40] why would we invest let let them be
[1:21:43] invest their time into video games and
[1:21:46] entertainment and we all know that them
[1:21:48] are voices that are drowning out the
[1:21:50] voice of God am there's so many voices
[1:21:52] out in the in the land today that is
[1:21:54] literally the prophet said that is
[1:21:56] drowning out the voice of God you don't
[1:22:00] want your child sitting in a message
[1:22:02] church and really can't be moved by a
[1:22:05] message I I see adults that way they
[1:22:08] can't even be moved anymore because
[1:22:10] they've given into voices of Gossip
[1:22:12] voices of this voices of that voices of
[1:22:15] that and they can sit in a message
[1:22:17] church and it doesn't even move them
[1:22:20] then they become just Topsy Turvy and
[1:22:22] and all of these things you don't want
[1:22:25] your children that
[1:22:28] way that's right Hallelujah
[1:22:31] hello you see if the prophet of Malachi
[1:22:34] for's message doesn't affect you or
[1:22:36] doesn't affect the people then you know
[1:22:39] what happens they won't return to the
[1:22:42] faith cuz there's nothing else that's
[1:22:45] going to do it you you you know it's
[1:22:47] it's sometimes we'll call it for Comfort
[1:22:51] Comfort everybody wants Comfort these
[1:22:53] days comfort
[1:22:55] comfort you know I I uh I we've been you
[1:23:00] know since we've been putting up that
[1:23:01] tent and working last month or so I've
[1:23:03] gained a little weight hate to say it
[1:23:06] now my dear Mother though she she really
[1:23:08] gave me lifted me up today she said it
[1:23:11] looks like you're still losing but I had
[1:23:13] to confess I said no but but that I

[1:23:41] and uh and and I I think this is what is
[1:23:44] is happening is is we're being comforted
[1:23:46] by so many things today and we think
[1:23:49] that that our children needs to be
[1:23:50] comforted now listen I I know it's an
[1:23:53] onslaught that we're we're coming into
[1:23:55] today it the lid of hell has been P
[1:23:57] lifted lifted off demons are pouring in
[1:24:00] they're streaming in the prophets
[1:24:01] already said this years ago and we're
[1:24:03] feeling them effects are we not and and
[1:24:06] and and but but here's the thing is we
[1:24:08] try to comfort our ourselves and not
[1:24:11] only ourselves but our children in in
[1:24:14] the things of the world and Satan's got
[1:24:16] so many things out there to offer some
[1:24:19] type of comfort but it's not good for
[1:24:21] your
[1:24:23] health hello
[1:24:24] it's literally uh you're decreasing in
[1:24:28] faith you're decreasing in godliness
[1:24:30] you're and you're becoming more people
[1:24:32] are becoming more Earthbound than they
[1:24:34] are Heavenly
[1:24:37] bound true true brother and it's
[1:24:39] slipping into the churches
[1:24:41] today now we all know that that God
[1:24:44] promised we preached what a few
[1:24:47] Wednesdays ago that God promised us
[1:24:50] comfort and there's only one comfort
[1:24:52] that is good for us and sents it himself
[1:24:56] he said I'll send the Comfort it'll be
[1:24:57] the spirit of Truth can you say amen and
[1:25:01] and the fact that God would send the
[1:25:03] spirit of Truth in this day with the
[1:25:05] Voice of Truth open the word to us and
[1:25:08] let us know that you don't belong in
[1:25:10] this world you belong up there you are
[1:25:12] always with me before the foundation of
[1:25:14] the world that ought to be our comfort
[1:25:16] that's the best Comfort we can have Amen
[1:25:19] brother
[1:25:21] amen that's the truth
[1:25:26] now if the prophet's message does not
[1:25:31] affect nothing will no nothing will
[1:25:35] bring us closer to God than the message
[1:25:37] of the hour am and not just saying I
[1:25:40] will go to a message church but actually
[1:25:42] this message is
[1:25:44] headship it leaves no room for nothing
[1:25:47] else it's head chip amen you could take
[1:25:50] you know used to we could take
[1:25:52] commentators and we could read what they
[1:25:53] have to say and we would add that to our
[1:25:56] sermon and and we would take this
[1:25:58] commentator add it to the sermon and
[1:25:59] we'd take this and add it oh they were
[1:26:02] all nice and then we piece our thought
[1:26:03] you know and come up with a good old
[1:26:05] thought you know but that's not the way
[1:26:07] with the message amen we we don't just
[1:26:09] cut listen to the message to get a good
[1:26:11] thought to preach on we listen to this
[1:26:14] message to submit Our Lives to it's
[1:26:17] going to change
[1:26:20] us see well but if it doesn't affect
[1:26:24] and if it doesn't affect people then
[1:26:26] they will fulfill the prophecy given for
[1:26:29] this lotsy and age they will become
[1:26:31] lovers of pleasure and lovers of self
[1:26:33] more than lovers of God that's a promise
[1:26:36] for this age for the world they will
[1:26:38] become truth Breakers and false accusers
[1:26:40] and incontinent that's a promise for the
[1:26:42] world for this day they will become
[1:26:44] lukewarm being neither cold nor hot
[1:26:47] they'll come into a condition their
[1:26:49] churchgoers their religion they even
[1:26:51] confess God and all that but they live
[1:26:52] in such a rotten condition that God
[1:26:55] wants to spew them and says I will spew
[1:26:57] them from my mouth in other words
[1:26:59] they'll not speak for me they'll not be
[1:27:01] my part of my word they'll not be part
[1:27:02] of anything amen see and and and and and
[1:27:05] so that's the condition that's the
[1:27:07] promise for the world today can you
[1:27:10] sayen now we recognize then as people

[1:34:12] mother is first with the child and she's
[1:34:14] a great responsibility of what that
[1:34:16] child will be will be based upon the way
[1:34:19] that mother starts that child on the on
[1:34:21] the path that it must travel mother has
[1:34:24] the responsibility from God to place
[1:34:26] that child on the right Road and I think
[1:34:28] that's why mothers has a special little
[1:34:30] touch that right another place children
[1:34:33] are Little Treasures that God has given
[1:34:35] you the responsibility of raising and
[1:34:38] I've always said and made this kind of a
[1:34:41] saying to mothers we know written a four
[1:34:43] gospels Matthew Mark Luke and John but
[1:34:45] there's a Fifth Gospel Unwritten that's
[1:34:47] mother she gets them before Matthew Mark
[1:34:50] Luke and John's teaching gets them see
[1:34:53] so the responsibility is placed upon you
[1:34:55] mothers and you fathers to raise these
[1:34:57] children to the afford the kingdom of
[1:35:00] God can you say Amen am amen now
[1:35:02] thinking of of Moses's mother and what
[1:35:06] Moses was and she recognized that he was
[1:35:09] a prophet recognize that he was to be a
[1:35:12] deliverer but our children you know our
[1:35:17] children may not be born to be a
[1:35:20] prophet may not be born to be a
[1:35:22] deliverer like Moses was do but they
[1:35:24] don't have to be a
[1:35:25] prophet they don't have to be a
[1:35:28] deliverer they don't even have to
[1:35:30] sing they don't have to be
[1:35:34] musicians hello
[1:35:36] amen the entire body of Christ isn't
[1:35:39] made up of just
[1:35:42] prophets or the fful ministry it isn't
[1:35:45] just made up of of of singers and
[1:35:48] musicians or whatever the Bible teaches
[1:35:52] us that there's one body in many members
[1:35:55] of that body amen ain't that right uh
[1:35:58] Corinthians 12: 15 if the word if the
[1:36:01] foot shall say because I'm not of the
[1:36:03] hand uh uh I am not of the body is it
[1:36:06] therefore not of the body and if the ear
[1:36:09] shall say because I am not the eye I am
[1:36:12] not of the body is it therefore not of
[1:36:14] the body if the whole body were an eye
[1:36:17] then where were the hearing if the whole
[1:36:18] were the body was the hearing where were
[1:36:21] the smelling see but now God has Set uh
[1:36:26] uh the members every one of them in the
[1:36:28] body as it has pleased him amen I want
[1:36:32] to tell you young people you're
[1:36:34] important yes sir
[1:36:37] amely you're important amen you're
[1:36:40] important to God you're important to the
[1:36:43] body of Christ you're important to this
[1:36:46] local
[1:36:48] assembly amen
[1:36:51] amen I consider her children to be a
[1:36:56] crop a
[1:36:58] harvest that has been
[1:37:03] planted Genesis
[1:37:07] 1:26 and God said let us make man in our
[1:37:10] image after our likeness and let them
[1:37:12] have dominion over the fish of the sea
[1:37:15] and over the fowl of the air and over
[1:37:16] the cattle and over all the Earth and
[1:37:19] over every creeping thing that creepeth
[1:37:21] upon the Earth so God created man in his
[1:37:24] own image and in the image of God
[1:37:26] created he him male and female created
[1:37:28] he them and God blessed them and God
[1:37:32] said unto them be fruitful and multiply
[1:37:35] and replenish the Earth and subdue it
[1:37:38] and have dominion over the fish of the
[1:37:39] sea and over the FL fou of the air and
[1:37:41] over every living thing that moveth upon
[1:37:43] the Earth is that right now they were
[1:37:46] not just to have children
[1:37:50] on but they were to have children like
[1:37:52] unto themselves
[1:37:55] Adam came by the spoken word and he was
[1:37:58] to bring children by the same way by the
[1:38:01] spoken word ain't that right amen see
[1:38:06] see when God plants the seed it should
[1:38:08] always bring forth of what he planted
[1:38:12] bring forth of its kind when God planted
[1:38:16] the Pentecostal seed on the day of
[1:38:18] Pentecost that's exactly what he
[1:38:21] intended it to be
[1:38:23] amen every
[1:38:25] generation every age should be a
[1:38:28] Pentecostal church just like the day he
[1:38:31] planted amen that's
[1:38:34] right if it brings forth anything else
[1:38:38] then we know that it's been tampered
[1:38:40] with ain't that right Eve Eve brought
[1:38:44] forth a hybrid crop she brought forth
[1:38:47] something different from the word of God
[1:38:50] and we know every denomination is is a
[1:38:53] product of
[1:38:55] hybridization it it it did not come from
[1:38:57] the original it it shows that something
[1:39:01] was hybrid and that is the result of it
[1:39:04] and hybriding always brings forth death
[1:39:07] ain't that right see and so Eve got away
[1:39:10] from the word and the natural church has
[1:39:13] gotten away from the word of God and
[1:39:16] it's brought forth nothing but
[1:39:18] illegitimate
[1:39:20] children illegitimate to the word
[1:39:24] I believe the prophet would say it that
[1:39:25] way illegitimate to the word in other
[1:39:27] words they don't know what the word is
[1:39:28] they don't know who their their their
[1:39:31] their father and mother is
[1:39:34] spiritually can you say amen Amen
[1:39:37] brother Braham said a hybrid crop is a
[1:39:39] dead crop yes it
[1:39:42] is I pray the Lord just plant that into
[1:39:45] our hearts a hybrid crop is a dead
[1:39:50] crop talking to a man the other day you
[1:39:52] know he's ons to a certain denomination
[1:39:54] he telling me so our our our church is
[1:39:56] dying our young people that we ain't got
[1:39:59] any we we don't know what we're going to
[1:40:01] do why you hybrid the word you kill it
[1:40:05] you bring forth hybridization you cannot
[1:40:07] bring forth another
[1:40:09] generation somewhere it's got to die
[1:40:12] sure
[1:40:15] amen so he said see a hybrid crop is a
[1:40:19] dead a dead crop far as rebreeding it
[1:40:23] won't rebreed itself it can't cuz God
[1:40:27] said so it has to bring forth of its
[1:40:29] kind and you've mixed it and you can see
[1:40:32] the church right there we're going to
[1:40:34] wind up he says it died there for it
[1:40:36] cannot bring forth of its kind why it's
[1:40:41] mixed you can't do nothing with it it's
[1:40:43] dead it's
[1:40:44] finished are you with
[1:40:47] me come on the moment we hybrid
[1:40:51] experiences all right
[1:40:56] the moment we substitute the Holy Ghost
[1:40:58] for something
[1:40:59] else you
[1:41:01] died and what does it do it not only
[1:41:04] affects your life it affects your
[1:41:06] children's
[1:41:08] life
[1:41:10] hello true right now the Luther Revival
[1:41:15] finished it's dead because it brought
[1:41:18] forth a hybrid crop Wesley Pentecostal
[1:41:22] revivals they f because they brought
[1:41:24] forth hybrid
[1:41:25] crop and they will never the prophet
[1:41:28] said they will never have a Revival
[1:41:29] again right they might have a gathering
[1:41:32] but never a Revival again of the true
[1:41:35] move of God can you say Amen but look by
[1:41:41] the message of the hour the perfect word
[1:41:44] has been restored to us
[1:41:46] again the perfect
[1:41:49] word that we don't have to put our own
[1:41:52] interpretation we don't have to guess at
[1:41:54] it we just simply believe it it's
[1:41:58] brought us back to being Sons and
[1:42:00] Daughters of God again spoken Sons
[1:42:04] spoken word daughters amen back to
[1:42:09] sunship
[1:42:12] again but not only is the word for us
[1:42:15] it's for our
[1:42:17] children do you believe it amen that's
[1:42:22] right God forbid that this Revival
[1:42:23] Brides Revival die with us we must not
[1:42:26] be at ease in
[1:42:28] Zion notice and I'm going to close here
[1:42:31] shortly but I do want to get it to you
[1:42:34] but notice the danger that we
[1:42:37] Face according to history looking at the
[1:42:40] history of Israel we see that Revival
[1:42:44] would come in one generation then the
[1:42:46] prophet shows us that that when the next
[1:42:49] Generation come the Revival started
[1:42:52] dying
[1:42:54] the fire started uh fading and in the
[1:42:58] third generation Embers may be glowing
[1:43:01] slightly but in the fourth there may be
[1:43:03] no Trace no Trace whatsoever of the
[1:43:06] original
[1:43:09] flame then after a time God would light
[1:43:12] that fire again and the same process is
[1:43:14] repeated yes
[1:43:17] Amen brother Ram says it is simply the
[1:43:20] manifestation of the truth that God has
[1:43:21] no grandchildren right can you say that
[1:43:24] with me God has no grandchildren God has
[1:43:26] no grandchildren right right the same
[1:43:30] experience that you it took for you it
[1:43:32] takes for your
[1:43:34] children amen are you with me amen
[1:43:38] people think that we got a better age
[1:43:40] today because you know our children are
[1:43:42] just got it so much better we didn't
[1:43:45] have television you know and so so you
[1:43:48] know we all had to go outside and play
[1:43:49] with sticks and all that but now bless
[1:43:51] the God blessed us you know we can now
[1:43:53] give them the television where they
[1:43:55] don't have to go out in the Heat and
[1:43:56] they got video games so they don't have
[1:43:58] to go out and use their imagination with
[1:44:00] the sticks and and all of these things
[1:44:03] no that's a curse amen
[1:44:06] amen all together I think so
[1:44:10] anyway true great so he said see God has
[1:44:15] no grandchildren salvation is not passed
[1:44:18] on by natural birth anymore than is
[1:44:21] there any truth to Apostolic succession
[1:44:24] it isn't in the word you start out with
[1:44:27] truly Born Again Believers and when the
[1:44:29] next Generation comes along they are no
[1:44:31] longer just plain Christians but they
[1:44:33] have taken a denominational name and are
[1:44:36] now are Baptist Methodist Etc that is
[1:44:39] exactly what they are too they are not
[1:44:41] Christians you have to be born of the
[1:44:42] will of God not the will of man to be
[1:44:46] saved so this is exactly what happened
[1:44:48] in the first church age I believe it
[1:44:50] what the first church age started 30
[1:44:52] some years 50 some years after the day
[1:44:55] of Pentecost and already at that at just
[1:44:58] at that little short time God is
[1:44:59] rebuking that age saying you've left
[1:45:01] your first
[1:45:03] love why the fire started dying Amen
[1:45:07] brother Braham said see the original
[1:45:08] fire had died down and they weren't the
[1:45:11] same anymore the fervent desire to
[1:45:13] please God the passion to know his word
[1:45:16] the cry for reaching out in the spirit
[1:45:18] all began to fade and instead of that
[1:45:21] church being on fire with the fire of
[1:45:23] God it had cooled off and became a bit
[1:45:26] formal and he said the abandonment to
[1:45:29] God had died out and the people weren't
[1:45:31] too careful about what God thought of
[1:45:32] them as they began to be careful about
[1:45:34] what the world thought of
[1:45:36] them ain't that right brother Brown says
[1:45:39] when the church thinks more of
[1:45:41] conforming to the world instead of
[1:45:42] conforming to God it isn't long until
[1:45:44] you see them stop doing the things they
[1:45:46] used to do and start doing things they
[1:45:48] wouldn't do initially they changed their
[1:45:50] manner of dress their attitudes their
[1:45:52] behavior
[1:45:53] and they get
[1:45:54] lacks yes amen he says that cycle of
[1:45:58] Revival and death has never failed all
[1:46:00] you have to do is recall this last move
[1:46:02] of God in the spirit when men and women
[1:46:04] dressed like Christians went to church
[1:46:06] prayed all night took to street corners
[1:46:09] and weren't ashamed of the
[1:46:10] manifestations of the spirit he said see
[1:46:13] the church at Ephesus Ephesus they left
[1:46:15] their old dead churches and worshiped in
[1:46:19] homes or old store buildings they had
[1:46:22] reality but it wasn't too long a time
[1:46:25] until they began to get enough money to
[1:46:26] build new fine churches see and they put
[1:46:29] in a choir instead of singing unto God
[1:46:32] for themselves they put gowns on the
[1:46:34] choir and they organized a movement and
[1:46:36] ran it by man and they soon began to
[1:46:39] read books that weren't fit to read and
[1:46:41] they let down bars the bars and goat the
[1:46:43] goats came in and took over the Cry Of
[1:46:46] Joy was gone the freedom of the spirit
[1:46:48] was gone oh they kept on with the form
[1:46:51] but the fire had died down and the
[1:46:53] Blackness of Ashes is about all that is
[1:46:57] left that's true that was the first
[1:46:59] church age and in each age it has
[1:47:01] happened the the cycle of Revival and
[1:47:04] death has
[1:47:05] happened and now we're here in the worst
[1:47:08] stage of them all the Le oysan age where
[1:47:11] Jesus says it's the only age that God
[1:47:13] would tell them you're blind wretched
[1:47:16] miserable naked and don't know it amen
[1:47:20] but as we've said Revelations 18:4 and I
[1:47:23] heard another voice from Heaven saying
[1:47:24] come out of her my people that you be
[1:47:26] not partakers of her sins and that you
[1:47:29] receive not of her plagues that's right
[1:47:31] how many's come
[1:47:33] out I've come out Hallelujah now you
[1:47:35] know why you come out it's death out
[1:47:39] there you come out of death into
[1:47:43] life don't look back and look for that
[1:47:46] for your
[1:47:47] children your children cannot be
[1:47:50] comforted by them things don't teach
[1:47:54] them that they can be don't put an
[1:47:56] impression that they can be they're
[1:47:59] going to go through discouragement but
[1:48:01] teach them the way of the
[1:48:05] Lord amen amen see we haven't been
[1:48:09] grandfathered in we had to receive an
[1:48:12] experience yeah but what about our
[1:48:14] children I do not believe that God has
[1:48:16] called us to bring forth a hybrid
[1:48:19] crop God forbid that we do that's right
[1:48:22] brother amen God gave us our children
[1:48:25] amen Psalms 1273 low children are in
[1:48:29] Heritage of the Lord and the fruit of
[1:48:31] the womb is his reward you realize that
[1:48:35] by the message of the hour and I know
[1:48:36] we've brought it before and you could go
[1:48:39] listen to the the the series of adoption
[1:48:42] and and so many other
[1:48:44] sermons uh uh but but we we have been
[1:48:48] brought over into the land of adoption
[1:48:52] this is not just a saying this is
[1:48:54] absolute truth this is facts this is
[1:48:56] reality amen we've been brought over
[1:48:59] into the land of adoption what is that
[1:49:03] it was the promised land we are living
[1:49:06] in the Ephesus again I I think it's
[1:49:08] Paradox in 64 that or 62 62 or 64 he
[1:49:12] preached it three or four times but but
[1:49:14] brother Brown talks about that that we
[1:49:16] are living in the Ephesus Age Again an
[1:49:19] Ephesians age and he Compares that with
[1:49:22] the age of Joshua when Joshua by his
[1:49:25] message brought Israel over into the
[1:49:27] promised land and not just let him run
[1:49:29] wild he placed them strategically
[1:49:32] positionally in their
[1:49:35] inheritance that's right amen it was
[1:49:38] then they could possess the land it was
[1:49:40] then they could defeat their Giants it
[1:49:41] was then that they could say this land
[1:49:43] belongs to us it's then that God they
[1:49:46] could see the reality of every promise
[1:49:48] that God had made
[1:49:50] them that's right yes sir can you say
[1:49:53] Amen so we have been brought over by the
[1:49:56] message of the hour into the promised
[1:49:58] land this age of adoption and are being
[1:50:01] positionally placed in our
[1:50:03] inheritance now see the land was their
[1:50:06] inheritance and I want you to I want to
[1:50:08] read this brother Brown said see it was
[1:50:10] such a great thing that the
[1:50:14] inheritance how it was that in and
[1:50:17] inheritance in the land notice that no
[1:50:20] one else but a close
[1:50:23] Kinsman could redeem that
[1:50:26] inheritance no
[1:50:28] one but a close Kinsman could redeem
[1:50:32] that inheritance now after he says that
[1:50:35] notice what he says right after oh now
[1:50:39] just let me drop a little token here
[1:50:41] that I touched on the other night to you
[1:50:43] mothers how many here has prayed for
[1:50:45] your loved ones lost all right there you
[1:50:48] go are again your inheritance
[1:50:52] amen what's your inheritance your
[1:50:55] children that's right that's your
[1:50:58] inheritance amen
[1:51:01] hallelujah Paul told the Roman said
[1:51:04] believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and
[1:51:06] thou and thy house shall be saved if
[1:51:08] you've got enough faith for your own
[1:51:10] self to be saved have faith enough no
[1:51:13] matter how Wayward that boy is or that
[1:51:15] girl is they'll be saved
[1:51:19] anyhow God somehow if he has to lay them
[1:51:22] on their back laying there in the
[1:51:23] hospital dying they'll be saved God
[1:51:27] promised it that's the
[1:51:32] inheritance hall now notice here's the
[1:51:36] promise now
[1:51:38] remember Moses's mother recognized the
[1:51:41] promise over her
[1:51:43] child she connected her child with the
[1:51:46] promise
[1:51:48] yes and she acted on by faith yes
[1:51:53] now notice the promise for
[1:51:55] you Isaiah 65:17 for behold I create new
[1:51:59] heavens and a new Earth and the former
[1:52:01] shall not be remembered nor come into
[1:52:03] mine but be ye glad and rejoice forever
[1:52:06] in that which I create for behold I
[1:52:08] create Jerusalem a rejoicing in her
[1:52:10] people a joy and I will rejoice in
[1:52:13] Jerusalem and joy in my people and the
[1:52:15] voice of weeping shall no more be heard
[1:52:17] in her for the voice nor the voice of
[1:52:20] crying there shall no more
[1:52:23] then an infant uh there shall be no more
[1:52:26] then an infant of days nor an old man
[1:52:29] that hath not filled his days for the
[1:52:31] child shall die 100 years old but the
[1:52:34] sinner being 100 years old shall be ACC
[1:52:36] cursed and they shall build houses and
[1:52:39] inhabit and they shall plant Vineyards
[1:52:42] and eat the fruit of them they shall not
[1:52:44] build in another inhabited inhabit they
[1:52:46] shall not plant and another eat for as
[1:52:49] the days of a tree are the days of my
[1:52:51] people and my elect shall long enjoy the
[1:52:54] work of their hands they shall not labor
[1:52:57] in vain nor bring forth for trouble they
[1:53:00] for they are the seed of the Blessed of
[1:53:03] the Lord and their
[1:53:06] offspring with
[1:53:09] them how many is the seed of the Lord
[1:53:13] amen praise God and your
[1:53:18] Offspring with you
[1:53:21] amen if if you notice Moses was born in
[1:53:24] a dangerous
[1:53:26] time it was a time when Pharaoh was
[1:53:30] putting all the children to death
[1:53:32] brother Braham said it was the devil in
[1:53:33] the form of Ramsay and he had purposed
[1:53:36] to get rid of the children with the
[1:53:37] natural death they stabbed the little
[1:53:39] ones and threw them over into the rivers
[1:53:43] for the crocodiles to eat and the
[1:53:44] crocodiles got all fattened up with them
[1:53:46] and the Hebrew children and all these
[1:53:49] things and but why why why why did he
[1:53:52] want want to kill the children is if you
[1:53:54] read it in the Bible is because the
[1:53:56] Hebrews were increasing in number
[1:53:59] increasing they they weren't diminishing
[1:54:01] they were increasing because they kept
[1:54:03] bringing on generation after generation
[1:54:05] so finally he said let's just kill the
[1:54:07] children let's kill them all off see and
[1:54:11] and so then we find that the the king
[1:54:14] set taskmasters over them to afflict
[1:54:16] them with their burdens and they built
[1:54:18] for Pharaoh treasure cities and all
[1:54:21] these things and they ined them more and
[1:54:23] the more they inflicted them the more
[1:54:25] the children of Israel
[1:54:27] multiplied and so they the Bible says
[1:54:30] they were grieved because of the
[1:54:31] children of Israel and then we find that
[1:54:33] Pharaoh uh uh called forth the two
[1:54:37] Hebrew midwives and told him that every
[1:54:39] male child that you deliver kill it and
[1:54:43] and the Bible says that but the the
[1:54:45] women feared God and and they would not
[1:54:47] do it and God blessed them for that so
[1:54:50] then Pharaoh Exodus 1 122 he charged all
[1:54:54] his people saying every son that is born
[1:54:57] ye cast shall cast into the river and
[1:54:59] every daughter you shall save a life so
[1:55:01] there went a a a great great Slaughter
[1:55:03] throughout Egypt and it was in the time
[1:55:06] that that Moses Moses was
[1:55:09] born
[1:55:10] and but but Moses's parents as we read
[1:55:14] did not fear the Commandment of the king
[1:55:17] because they knew that their child was
[1:55:19] in the hands of God and they believe
[1:55:21] that so she built this this this little
[1:55:24] basket it was well brother BR said it
[1:55:25] was the ark it was an ark and and and by
[1:55:29] faith she done all this by Faith by
[1:55:33] faith she knew that her child was a
[1:55:35] proper Child by faith she knew that he
[1:55:37] was the deliverer by faith she she knew
[1:55:40] that he was the one that God had
[1:55:42] promised and uh she could tie it to the
[1:55:44] scriptures and it was by Faith by faith
[1:55:47] she built this basket by faith she put
[1:55:50] her baby in this this Ark and by face
[1:55:52] she she put that little Ark with the
[1:55:55] baby in it in that uh crocodile infested
[1:55:59] waters
[1:56:01] true the prophet said she built that Ark
[1:56:04] not by her own knowledge but by she was
[1:56:06] directed on how to build it and she
[1:56:09] directed it in such a way that when she
[1:56:11] put it out there them old fat alligators
[1:56:14] they were looking say m what's that
[1:56:15] smell you know and and and and smelt
[1:56:18] that boy and and and here they come to
[1:56:20] to attack it like they would any other
[1:56:22] but there was something there was a
[1:56:24] stench about it that that that pitch uh
[1:56:28] uh brother Brown said it was something
[1:56:30] about that that caused them them them
[1:56:32] alligators to stay away from that baby
[1:56:35] and it was floating that mother did it
[1:56:36] all by Faith by faith she didn't want to
[1:56:40] part from that baby she didn't want to
[1:56:41] place that baby in in that danger but by
[1:56:45] faith that's right brother that's right
[1:56:49] Lord I thinking of you mothers that have
[1:56:52] raise your children in this old
[1:56:55] dangerous
[1:56:56] World demons all around that is set
[1:56:59] there to devour you devour your children
[1:57:03] it's the most dangerous age ever in my
[1:57:07] opinion but we do not
[1:57:10] fear we don't bring fear upon our
[1:57:13] children we don't bring fear upon our
[1:57:17] household as though the devil is going
[1:57:19] to gift
[1:57:20] him but we place them in God's hands by
[1:57:24] faith we teach them by faith don't you
[1:57:28] worry about tomorrow you worry about
[1:57:30] today amen amen can you say Amen we
[1:57:34] can't protect them in Every Which Way
[1:57:36] but by
[1:57:37] faith that's true we're doing it by
[1:57:40] faith
[1:57:41] amen that's right sir they're going to
[1:57:44] make mistakes but by
[1:57:47] faith the Lord they may not show any
[1:57:50] signs of positivity toward God but by
[1:57:54] faith amen can you say
[1:57:59] amen amen I'm so glad I had parents that
[1:58:02] lived by faith that's right not only to
[1:58:05] believe God for miracles
[1:58:08] and I could go tell you story after
[1:58:10] story about how God provided things for
[1:58:14] our
[1:58:15] families through Dad mom's
[1:58:18] Faith praise the Lord filled gas dad's
[1:58:21] gas t pank up one time time had no
[1:58:26] groceries and God would provide it send
[1:58:28] someone at the door with
[1:58:31] groceries it was just constant by Faith
[1:58:34] by Faith by faith the Lord but I'm so
[1:58:37] glad I had parents that could use that
[1:58:38] same faith on me I was an honor guy
[1:58:42] prise the Lord but they would never tell
[1:58:45] me I'm honor they would never tell me
[1:58:47] just how a brat I
[1:58:49] was oh I got my share of whooping
[1:58:53] I got I got wooden paddles broke over my
[1:58:56] rum couple
[1:58:59] times that my mom and dad by faith loved
[1:59:03] me they never told me how a sorry they
[1:59:06] were that they had me they never let me
[1:59:09] you know taught me that it was the devil
[1:59:11] that would teach me I was
[1:59:12] demon-possessed that's right it was the
[1:59:14] devil that would try to tell me I was a
[1:59:16] hopeless case my parents never told me
[1:59:18] them things that's right can you say
[1:59:20] Amen they do it by faith they may have
[1:59:23] not saw any positive sign about me but
[1:59:26] by faith right right amen it was by
[1:59:31] faith can you say
[1:59:33] amen and that's the same thing with you
[1:59:35] I I remember my mom you know I had uh
[1:59:39] she says I had dry dry scalp I I'm sure
[1:59:41] I did but you know it was real pretty
[1:59:44] flaky but my mom took advantage of that
[1:59:46] you know and she may not even remember
[1:59:48] but I remember getting the olive oil out
[1:59:51] and putting me on the a chair and on the
[1:59:53] porch and uh she putting that olive oil
[1:59:56] on my head and just rubbing in my scalp
[1:59:59] and my mom and while she's doing is
[2:00:01] praying God touch Shawn God save Shawn
[2:00:06] God move upon him you know and I'm just
[2:00:09] sitting there listening to my mom
[2:00:10] praying over me and you know I found
[2:00:12] comfort in that and I you know I think
[2:00:14] Lord please do that Lord you know thank
[2:00:16] God for Mama answer her prayer I need it
[2:00:20] but but by faith
[2:00:23] everything was by faith can you say Amen
[2:00:25] do you love him see and so the prophet
[2:00:28] says they wasn't scared because they
[2:00:30] seen something in this baby to begin
[2:00:32] with they saw it that this was the
[2:00:34] answer of
[2:00:35] prayer and by faith she saw him with the
[2:00:38] children of Israel placing them over in
[2:00:41] the promised land so it was by faith can
[2:00:44] you say amen amen by Faith by the eyes
[2:00:47] of Faith the prophet said she seen what
[2:00:49] God was going to do she took him right
[2:00:52] down to the river in this little Ark no
[2:00:53] doubt we couldn't think that that was a
[2:00:55] natural act friends it's got to be a
[2:00:57] supernatural act there she was standing
[2:00:59] there with the crystal tears in her eyes
[2:01:02] as she placed her little baby as it were
[2:01:05] in the casket of death that was going to
[2:01:07] be uh to pitch it out in on the water
[2:01:10] there and of course she knew that by
[2:01:12] faith she believed that behind all the
[2:01:14] Clouds Of Darkness there was a living
[2:01:16] God who would take that baby to its
[2:01:18] destination for she seen it was a a
[2:01:22] proper child she did not let fear
[2:01:25] dictate her life dictate her actions and
[2:01:28] dictate that
[2:01:30] child it was by
[2:01:33] faith you love him we could go on and on
[2:01:37] and
[2:01:38] on but by
[2:01:41] faith if the musicians will
[2:01:45] come How Great Is Our
[2:01:48] God if I could say don't ever lose
[2:01:51] vision for your children amen don't ever
[2:01:54] if they're growned up or if they're
[2:01:56] young that's right they may be having
[2:01:59] little habits and they may have hangups
[2:02:02] don't you ever think that you got a
[2:02:04] perfect
[2:02:05] family and that your little old child is
[2:02:07] free from whatever Satan is on doing
[2:02:10] everything he can to distract that child
[2:02:13] at a young
[2:02:15] age don't think that when they get
[2:02:17] teenagers is when you start teaching
[2:02:19] them the ways of God and teaching them
[2:02:20] how to be faithful and teaching them how
[2:02:22] to you teach them right
[2:02:24] now at the very youngest
[2:02:27] age that's true when I see these little
[2:02:30] ones little Wyatt and little Autumn and
[2:02:33] these others and they're lifting their
[2:02:34] hands don't even know what they're doing
[2:02:36] I say but that's right that's the way to
[2:02:39] teach them that's what we're
[2:02:42] doing got Josiah's children there what
[2:02:46] is it it's it's teaching them the ways
[2:02:49] they may not understand what they're
[2:02:50] doing
[2:02:52] but it's teaching them the way amen I
[2:02:56] thought of this brother brah said now
[2:02:58] the reason I thought about saying this
[2:03:00] is because you people here most of you
[2:03:01] your children are saved they're
[2:03:04] Christians he said I have admired
[2:03:06] brother evans's family these young men
[2:03:08] here
[2:03:10] usually who would you get a teenager to
[2:03:12] sit around and listen to some a preacher
[2:03:15] talk why they'd be out and gone
[2:03:17] somewhere little girls like that and I
[2:03:20] said to brother Fred his kids they they
[2:03:23] can just hear me say one thing that's
[2:03:26] wrong and they're they're ready to stop
[2:03:28] it right now and set with highest
[2:03:31] respect instead of being out hot roding
[2:03:33] and rambling around see when they hear
[2:03:36] you speak about the gospel they're ready
[2:03:38] to sit right there and listen now I want
[2:03:41] I know we we all and I want you to
[2:03:44] listen he said I know we all want to
[2:03:46] think our kids is Renegades and things
[2:03:49] like that but we must stop that
[2:03:52] I believe that we must remember that
[2:03:54] these kids are the best kids in the
[2:03:56] world because they're our children and
[2:03:59] we claim them for God right amen can you
[2:04:03] say amen amen now your salvation will
[2:04:06] not save that child but now Paul said
[2:04:10] believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thy
[2:04:13] and thy house shall be saved now what
[2:04:15] did he mean by that he didn't mean that
[2:04:17] because they were saved that their house
[2:04:19] would be saved with it he meant this
[2:04:22] that because they if he had enough Faith
[2:04:25] to be saved himself his same amount of
[2:04:27] faith that he had for himself would work
[2:04:29] for his children see what I mean he said
[2:04:32] now I've got my children there's my
[2:04:34] little son Joseph and Billy and Sarah
[2:04:37] and Rebecca well now I want to see each
[2:04:40] one of them a worker in the gospel doing
[2:04:42] something I want to see them saved and
[2:04:44] filled with the Holy Ghost now I've
[2:04:46] committed them to God and say I'm
[2:04:49] holding on to God for them and I believe
[2:04:52] they're going to be saved every one of
[2:04:54] them I believe they're going to be saved
[2:04:56] and I'll have them on the other side and
[2:04:59] I don't believe my salvation will save
[2:05:01] them no but my faith in God will do it
[2:05:05] notice that my faith in God will do it
[2:05:08] can you say amen amen see you see my
[2:05:12] faith believ in God will do it and will
[2:05:14] cause them to come to Christ and I
[2:05:17] believe that's where you people praying
[2:05:19] for your children that's the reason your
[2:05:21] children has the manners and the real
[2:05:23] lady and gentlemen in this wild age that
[2:05:25] we're living in yet that part about them
