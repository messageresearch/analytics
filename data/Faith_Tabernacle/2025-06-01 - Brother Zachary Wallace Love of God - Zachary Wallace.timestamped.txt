[44:45] Every breath that I

[44:53] awake, Lord, have your way in
[44:59] me. Oh, this
[45:03] is it's my

[46:27] Amen. I bless you this morning, saints.
[46:32] It's good to be in the house of the Lord
[46:35] and so much more.
[46:39] to be the house of the Lord to be the
[46:42] dwelling place. What house will you
[46:44] build him? What where is the place of
[46:46] his rest? Where will be his tabernacle?
[46:49] It's not a house made by hands, but it's
[46:51] a
[46:53] body. Just go to the Lord in prayer this
[46:56] [Music]
[46:57] morning. Lord, we we love you. We thank
[47:01] you, Lord, that your presence is here
[47:03] among us, Father. Lord, not only do we
[47:06] know that by divine presence, Lord, but
[47:09] divine promise, Lord, but we feel your
[47:11] presence among us, Lord. And we just
[47:13] want to entertain you here this morning.
[47:15] We want to make you welcome, Lord. And I
[47:18] just ask, Father, that you would take
[47:20] this vessel of clay and use it, Father,
[47:22] to speak your word. And I pray, Lord,
[47:24] that it would be directly to the
[47:26] situation and the needs that's in our
[47:28] hearts and lives, Father. And I just
[47:30] pray that you would have freedom, Lord.
[47:33] And and I ask, Father, if there's
[47:35] anything that would hinder this service,
[47:37] Lord, if there's any sin in my heart,
[47:38] Lord, if there's anything in this
[47:40] congregation, Lord, I'm asking that the
[47:42] allsufficient blood of the Lord Jesus
[47:44] Christ would just come and cleanse and
[47:46] wash away every stain. Father, that we
[47:48] might enter into your presence this
[47:50] morning, Lord, with just freedom and
[47:52] joy. I ask, we ask your blessing upon
[47:55] each one here this morning and your
[47:57] blessing upon the word of God in the
[47:59] name of Jesus Christ. Amen.
[48:03] Amen. God bless you. It's good to be
[48:06] here again with you. Uh most of you were
[48:09] here on Wednesday night, but uh uh
[48:12] looking forward to what the Lord has for
[48:14] us this morning. If we could turn to
[48:17] Revelations the 19th chapter. Just uh
[48:19] we'll take a a scripture there. And you
[48:22] know, on on Wednesday night, I was
[48:25] preaching about the the grace of
[48:27] vindication and how how it's the grace
[48:30] of God that would show his word to us
[48:33] and make it real to us and how this
[48:35] message was vindicated to us. And I
[48:37] forgot, you know, you always think about
[48:39] a sermon and you're like, why didn't I
[48:41] say that or why didn't I read this? And
[48:43] I after the service I remembered that
[48:45] quote in the church age book where
[48:46] brother Brandham says uh speaking about
[48:49] this last day messenger and he says he
[48:51] will be more thoroughly vindicated than
[48:54] any messenger since the days of Enoch
[48:56] any prophet since Enoch and uh you know
[49:00] you think about these things after you
[49:01] say them but but you know we have
[49:04] received a message that's been
[49:05] vindicated so clearly that you know it
[49:08] it'd be a sin not to believe in
[49:12] Revelation Ians chapter 19 and verse 7.
[49:16] We'll read a a scripture here. Says,
[49:18] "Let us be glad and rejoice and give
[49:21] honor to him for the marriage of the
[49:24] lamb is come and his wife hath made
[49:27] herself ready." Can be seated this
[49:31] morning.
[49:33] Uh, you
[49:35] know, I had a I had a sermon. I was all
[49:38] ready to preach here this morning and
[49:40] for about two weeks I was like, "Yep,
[49:42] this is where we're going. This is what
[49:43] we're doing." And then yesterday
[49:45] afternoon, the Lord just kind of took it
[49:47] a different direction. So, uh, you'll
[49:50] just bear with me this morning, but I do
[49:52] believe it's it's something the Lord
[49:53] wants to express. But, but I I I've been
[49:56] looking a lot lately at this thought of
[49:58] of rapturing grace and how that God has
[50:02] has sent us a message. He has sent us a
[50:05] word and it was to bring us into a
[50:08] rapture condition because we know we're
[50:10] in that rapturing age. And and brother
[50:13] Brandham when he was preaching the the
[50:14] seals, he tells the people that he says,
[50:17] you know, there really hasn't been a
[50:18] revival for the bride yet. He says,
[50:19] "We're waiting for it and it'll take the
[50:21] seven thunders to wake up this bride to
[50:25] get her to get her into position." And
[50:27] and then he goes on to tell us later in
[50:29] questions and answers. He says the seven
[50:31] thunders was what the seven seals was
[50:34] what the seven thunders was revealing.
[50:36] That's what the thunders was about. And
[50:38] so this great awakening for the bride
[50:41] was happening right there when he's
[50:43] saying we're looking for it to happen.
[50:45] And and I believe that describes so many
[50:47] times the way people are. They're
[50:49] looking for a rapture. They're looking
[50:52] for a a something to happen. They're
[50:54] looking for something to get them ready.
[50:56] And it's already here. It's already
[50:58] taking place. It's already uh happening.
[51:00] And and kind of how the the people they
[51:02] were looking in that day saying, "Fast
[51:04] and pray. Fast and pray. There'll be a
[51:06] great awakening of the day sometime."
[51:07] And brother Brand says, "Why are they
[51:08] doing that?" Because they haven't
[51:10] recognized what's going on right now.
[51:12] They haven't recognized that awakening
[51:13] of the bride. And he says, "It's already
[51:15] happened right here. They didn't notice
[51:17] it. They didn't recognize it." And and
[51:20] so to to put it very very simply and
[51:23] very plainly, the the opening of the
[51:25] word, the opening of those seals, it is
[51:28] the it is the bride's revival. It's the
[51:30] awakening of the bride out of a dark
[51:33] denominationalism. And so when I read
[51:35] this quote here from 1959, you have to
[51:38] recognize it in its context. He's in the
[51:40] lo the angelist temple temple preaching
[51:42] to the Pentecostal peoples uh largely
[51:45] and he says we've got to have awakening
[51:48] right quick or you're going to miss the
[51:50] rapture friends it could happen at any
[51:53] time. So he's telling them this this
[51:55] Pentecostal group wake up wake up or
[51:58] you're going to miss the rapture. And
[52:00] now I I want to to uh make that um I I
[52:05] want to make that present tense to us
[52:07] right now. We know because of the
[52:09] opening of the word. We know because of
[52:10] the seals that the awakening of the
[52:12] bride has already been declared. It's
[52:15] already taken place. And so, how could
[52:17] the
[52:18] bride who is awake miss the rapture?
[52:24] Friends, it can't happen. You can't miss
[52:28] it. If you have received that opening of
[52:31] the word, if you have recognized your
[52:34] day and its message, how could you miss
[52:37] it? And to make that a little more
[52:39] clear, you know, I I was just at my my
[52:41] brother's wedding. I was able to
[52:43] officiate, which is really weird telling
[52:45] your brother he can kiss a girl, but but
[52:48] I was there officiating the wedding and
[52:50] and doing all these things, getting it
[52:51] all ready. And and and after the
[52:54] wedding, we had the we had the uh the
[52:57] the what do you call that? reception,
[52:59] everybody's eating and everything and
[53:00] and I was preaching the next morning.
[53:02] So, I ran off and and I left and I
[53:04] didn't get to see the bridal sendoff
[53:06] where they, you know, they send the
[53:07] bride off and they hold the sparklers or
[53:08] blow the bubbles or whatever they do. I
[53:10] don't know what they did. I wasn't
[53:11] there. I left early. And so, I didn't
[53:13] get to see the bride caught up. I didn't
[53:17] get to see the bride taken away. But,
[53:20] you know
[53:22] what? You could you could be wondering,
[53:24] "Hey, will I be a part of this? Will I
[53:26] be a part of this? Will will will I see
[53:28] this happen? Will I be there? But you
[53:30] know, there's one person at that wedding
[53:32] who wasn't worried about missing the
[53:34] sendoff. And that was Alyssa because she
[53:38] was the bride. And you know what?
[53:41] There's no husband that's ever left for
[53:42] the honeymoon and forgot his wife
[53:44] behind. It doesn't happen. If there's
[53:46] going if he's going to the honeymoon,
[53:48] he's going to take his bride with him.
[53:49] And we are not going to a marriage. We
[53:51] are going to the wedding supper. And
[53:54] after the wedding supper to the
[53:55] millennium, which is the honeymoon for
[53:56] the bride, he's not going to forget his
[53:58] bride behind. And if you have been
[54:01] identified by elective love, if he's
[54:03] come down and placed his choosing on
[54:05] your life and he said, "You are my
[54:07] bride. I love you. I have chosen you."
[54:09] Are you going to sit there after you've
[54:11] been united to him in an invisible union
[54:13] and say, "Well, I hope I don't miss it."
[54:16] Friends, oh my. You can't miss it when
[54:20] you're the bride of Jesus Christ.
[54:23] It's not going to happen.
[54:26] If you have accepted or received that
[54:29] rapturing grace that his favor is on
[54:32] your life, that his choosing is on you,
[54:35] then you're not fearful about it. You're
[54:37] not worried about it. You're in a
[54:39] relationship.
[54:41] Now, another example would be, you know,
[54:43] uh uh when you go to get travel
[54:45] someplace, you catch a flight and people
[54:48] that they'll warn you, don't miss your
[54:49] flight. And that's good advice. Anybody
[54:52] here ever missed a flight? Yeah. It's
[54:54] not a lot of fun and it's usually rather
[54:56] expensive and you're just like
[54:58] especially if you're on your way home
[54:59] after a trip, you're just like, I just
[55:00] want to get home and then you miss that
[55:02] flight. It's just a bad deal. So, you
[55:04] know, you really prepare. You make sure
[55:06] you try to get there early. You try to
[55:07] be there on time. You you you make sure
[55:09] you're going to be there. You're
[55:10] watching your your phone for any
[55:11] updates. Is my what's going on with my
[55:13] flight? What gates it going to be at?
[55:15] All these different things. So, there's
[55:16] a time there's a season when you're
[55:18] worried about missing it. But, you know
[55:20] what? When you've got your ticket in
[55:22] your hand and you've already made it on
[55:24] board that plane and you're in your
[55:26] designated position sitting on that
[55:28] plane with that token in your hand
[55:29] telling you that that's your place. You
[55:31] know what? I'm not worried about am I
[55:33] going to make it. I feel the power in
[55:35] that plane resonating through the wings.
[55:37] I feel the engines roaring up. I'm not
[55:40] worried about missing my flight. I'm
[55:41] already a part of this. I'm already on
[55:44] board. I'm in my position. I'm just
[55:45] waiting cuz any moment from now it's
[55:47] going to take off from off that earth
[55:49] and I'm going to take into the skies.
[55:51] I'm not worried about it. I'm resting in
[55:53] it. Oh friends, when you can recognize
[55:57] the grace of God, he's choosing. Now, if
[55:59] you're not a part of this bride and
[56:01] you're not a part of this and you
[56:02] haven't got into that relationship with
[56:04] him, well then there's a there's a
[56:06] certainly a lot of concern. Well, what
[56:07] about missing it? What about it? What
[56:09] about it? But when you have come into
[56:11] that relationship of an invisible union
[56:14] and you've come under that uniting and
[56:16] you've come under that headship of
[56:17] Christ which is all through this message
[56:19] of the hour when you have come under
[56:21] that there's not a fearful wonder if
[56:24] I'll miss it. Oh no you're a part of it.
[56:27] It couldn't go without you. My brother
[56:30] Justice did not leave that wedding
[56:32] without his bride. And she wasn't
[56:34] worried. I better keep an eye on him so
[56:36] he doesn't slip out the door without me.
[56:38] No. No. She was trusting that he
[56:41] actually meant what he said when he said
[56:43] he loved her when they made those vows
[56:46] to be united together.
[56:49] Now, we we we we somehow we've kind of
[56:53] got this this idea built up in our
[56:55] minds. And in a lot of ways, I would
[56:56] call it a complex. And and we know that
[56:59] the bride is perfect. And so we think
[57:01] that if we could just be good enough and
[57:04] and never make another mistake and and
[57:06] work really hard to be a perfect human
[57:08] that then we'll be good enough to make
[57:11] it in the bride. Well friends, that's a
[57:14] lie.
[57:16] That is not how God's economy works. And
[57:20] and and back I I'll share this testimony
[57:22] with you. Uh Hudson or brother Daniel,
[57:26] where's brother Daniel?
[57:28] Well, all right. Uh, Junior, can you
[57:31] grab my measuring stick? It's back here.
[57:33] Thank you, sir. Um, back about uh 10
[57:35] years ago, I had went to a church
[57:37] meeting and asked if the Lord would heal
[57:40] me of migraine headaches. I said, "Lord,
[57:42] will you heal me?" Because I thought
[57:43] maybe the Lord put this here for some
[57:45] reason. And after and I went to that
[57:47] meeting. I says, "Lord, I've got one
[57:48] question. Can I be healed?" And the Lord
[57:51] told me, "Yes." He gave me a very clear
[57:53] answer. Yes, you can be healed. And I
[57:55] went home. I was really excited. I says,
[57:56] "Praise God, I can be healed." And for
[57:58] 10 years, I left it at can be
[58:02] healed. And you know what I was actually
[58:04] waiting for? I didn't realize it, but I
[58:06] started to notice later. I was actually
[58:09] waiting to be good enough that God would
[58:12] decide to heal
[58:15] me. You guys have low clearances here.
[58:18] You can just set it right here up front.
[58:20] And I was waiting until I was so good
[58:23] that or I did something so wonderful
[58:26] that the Lord says, "You know what? I'm
[58:27] gonna reward you by healing you. That
[58:30] was what I was actually doing in my
[58:31] mind. I was waiting to be good enough.
[58:34] And and and I I mean I don't know I
[58:36] don't know what I how I got that in my
[58:38] mind, but that is not what the word of
[58:40] God teaches. The word of God does not
[58:41] teach when you get good enough. I'll
[58:43] heal you. He says when you believe my
[58:45] word, when I said by my stripes you're
[58:47] healed, then you can be healed. That's
[58:49] what it's based on. Not on how good you
[58:51] are or how many good works you do, but
[58:53] believing the promise of God. And so I
[58:56] about about uh after about 10 years I
[58:59] was in a service and brother Andrew
[59:00] Glover was preaching on overcoming fear
[59:02] and I'm like I'm not afraid am I? And
[59:03] and the Lord's like you're afraid to
[59:05] claim your
[59:06] healing. I said well I'm not going to
[59:08] let that go one more day. And so I stood
[59:11] on that promise and I said Lord I'm
[59:13] standing on a promise. You said I could
[59:15] be healed and I'm claiming it this
[59:17] night. I receive and accept my healing.
[59:20] And that started a battle that night. I
[59:22] began to battle. I began to war with the
[59:25] enemy and I' I'd be sitting there, you
[59:26] know, vomiting with a migraine headache
[59:28] saying, "But Lord, you said I'm healed
[59:30] and I believe that over this pain. I
[59:32] believe that over this vomiting. I
[59:34] believe that over my circumstance." And
[59:36] and that went on for about four months
[59:38] until we came up here to the to the camp
[59:40] meeting here. And when I came back from
[59:42] that camp meeting a year ago, was
[59:44] completely healed of migraines.
[59:47] And it wasn't based off of how good I
[59:49] was. It was based off of me receiving a
[59:53] promise. But I I want to show you
[59:56] something here and and kind of I guess
[59:58] how we we build these things up in our
[1:00:00] minds. And and so we have down here we
[1:00:02] have this this measuring stick of of
[1:00:04] righteousness. And down here on the
[1:00:06] lower category, we have the filthy
[1:00:08] category. And then you get a little bit
[1:00:10] higher up and and you're not just
[1:00:12] filthy, you're dirty now. You're you're
[1:00:13] getting somewhere. And then finally, you
[1:00:15] get up to the top and you're righteous.
[1:00:18] And uh so let let's let's measure up
[1:00:20] here. Let's see. Brother David, let's
[1:00:22] see where you're at. Let's measure you
[1:00:23] on this stick here. All right. Let's
[1:00:29] see. This is supposed to be up higher,
[1:00:32] but we'll put it up here. There we go.
[1:00:34] So, there you are. You're right here.
[1:00:36] Look at this. This is where you're at.
[1:00:38] Turn
[1:00:39] around. See that? That means you're a
[1:00:42] part of that down there. You know what
[1:00:43] that's called? Filthy. You don't measure
[1:00:46] up today, buddy. Sorry. Go have a seat.
[1:00:49] Let's see. Uh, how are you doing? Let's
[1:00:52] measure you
[1:00:53] up. You know, we do this so many times.
[1:00:56] We say, "Oh, well, you know, I I came to
[1:00:58] the Lord. I I quit my lying. I quit my
[1:01:01] stealing. I I'm doing a little bit
[1:01:02] better. I don't smoke anymore. If I can
[1:01:04] just get rid of that drinking, then I'll
[1:01:06] finally be a better person." And so, we
[1:01:09] get on
[1:01:10] there. All right. Look at here, son.
[1:01:12] This is where you're at.
[1:01:16] You haven't quite made it to dirty yet.
[1:01:18] You're still
[1:01:19] filthy. All right. So, now, uh, Brother
[1:01:21] Branson, come on up here. Let's get you
[1:01:24] to measure
[1:01:25] up. All right. So, I mean, this guy, I
[1:01:28] mean, look at him. He's looking really
[1:01:29] good. He's He's giving his life to the
[1:01:31] Lord. He's I mean, he's wearing a tie.
[1:01:33] He's got some nice shoes on. There's a
[1:01:34] little speck on that one shoe, buddy. I
[1:01:36] don't know about this, but you know, he
[1:01:38] we're he's getting better. He's starting
[1:01:39] to measure up. We put him on the c on
[1:01:41] the on the on the measuring stick. And
[1:01:44] hey, you're right here, Branson. Look at
[1:01:45] this. You're right there. There we go.
[1:01:48] You know
[1:01:49] what? You're still down there in the
[1:01:51] filthy category. I don't care how much
[1:01:53] you think you've climbed up this, you'll
[1:01:56] always be down there because the best of
[1:01:58] your works, the best of your
[1:01:59] righteousness is filthy rags in the
[1:02:02] sight of God. The prophet of God said
[1:02:04] that God is so holy and so righteous
[1:02:07] that the angels look dirty in his sight.
[1:02:11] and you want to try and earn something
[1:02:13] by your filthy rags.
[1:02:15] No, it's not going to happen. You by
[1:02:18] your efforts, your ability will never
[1:02:20] make it out of filthiness. And you know
[1:02:22] what? There's only one thing that can
[1:02:24] ever put you up here in the
[1:02:25] righteousness of God. And that's not
[1:02:27] your efforts. That's not your ability.
[1:02:29] That is the blood of Jesus Christ and
[1:02:30] his grace that comes and he takes you
[1:02:33] and he takes your sins and he becomes
[1:02:35] sin. And that you might become the very
[1:02:37] righteousness of God. So that when you
[1:02:40] are clothed in his righteousness, the
[1:02:42] when God compares you, a sinner saved by
[1:02:44] grace that have come beneath that blood,
[1:02:46] the righteousness of God on you and an
[1:02:48] angel standing next to you, the angel
[1:02:50] would look dirty compared to the
[1:02:52] righteousness of God that you're clothe.
[1:02:55] That is grace. You didn't earn it.
[1:02:59] Now you lean that up against the wall
[1:03:02] right there.
[1:03:04] the grace of God. You'll never get
[1:03:06] anything from God by trying to measure
[1:03:09] up in your works. You'll never get
[1:03:12] anything from God by trying to be good
[1:03:14] enough and trying to do all, you know,
[1:03:17] all the Pharisee laws right. No, that's
[1:03:20] not what you're going to get. You need
[1:03:22] to get your eyes off of works. This
[1:03:24] bride is pure and she is virtuous. She's
[1:03:26] the sinless bride of the son of the
[1:03:28] living God. But that's not based on
[1:03:30] being a good Pharisee. that is based on
[1:03:34] not your ability or your works. Good
[1:03:36] works do not produce righteousness. All
[1:03:39] right? Good works produce filthy rags.
[1:03:46] Good works does not produce
[1:03:47] righteousness. Good works produce filthy
[1:03:50] rags. Righteousness, the righteousness
[1:03:52] of God produces good works.
[1:03:56] But your good works will never produce
[1:03:59] righteousness. That's right. Oh friends,
[1:04:01] we have this so messed up in our mind.
[1:04:04] We think if I'm just good enough, then
[1:04:05] I'll be righteous. No, you receive the
[1:04:08] righteousness of God and then he begins
[1:04:10] to work through you the good works. He
[1:04:12] begins to work through you the the the
[1:04:14] love and the kindness and the the
[1:04:15] goodness to his fellow man. And you know
[1:04:17] what an old saying Martin Luther made
[1:04:19] which is pretty good. He says, "God
[1:04:21] don't need your good works, but your
[1:04:22] neighbor does." You know, go you don't
[1:04:24] need to show God how good you are, but
[1:04:26] your neighbor could use a little bit of
[1:04:27] kindness sometimes. God is so far beyond
[1:04:30] man and his holiness and his
[1:04:32] righteousness. The scripture says in in
[1:04:34] in first in 2 Corinthians uh five it
[1:04:37] says that he was made sin for us. So
[1:04:40] that holy one without spot that holy one
[1:04:42] in such purity he became filthy in sin
[1:04:46] that you might be made the very
[1:04:48] righteousness of God. So I say to you,
[1:04:51] forget your works, forget your ability,
[1:04:53] forget your strength, and trust only in
[1:04:56] his righteousness and his grace on your
[1:04:59] life. His blood was enough. When he said
[1:05:02] it is finished, it doesn't mean you need
[1:05:04] to add one little bit of your own human
[1:05:06] ability to the equation. When he said it
[1:05:08] was done, it was finished.
[1:05:11] It's by God's grace that you have been
[1:05:13] washed as white as snow and been made
[1:05:15] the very righteousness of God. But
[1:05:18] humanly you will never feel good enough.
[1:05:23] You see, because your human feelings, if
[1:05:25] you really are honest with yourself,
[1:05:27] your human feelings will always leave
[1:05:29] you down in that filthy category because
[1:05:31] the best you could ever produce compared
[1:05:33] to God. That's right. Filthy rags. Amen.
[1:05:37] So, how can I be in that pure and
[1:05:40] perfect bride? Well, you're simply
[1:05:43] resting in his election on your life.
[1:05:46] The question has never been, "Are you
[1:05:48] good enough?" The question is, "Is he
[1:05:52] good enough?"
[1:05:54] There was a man, I love the little
[1:05:56] story, it his name was Papa Cox, and
[1:05:58] Brother Brandham talked to him. He says,
[1:05:59] "Papa, why don't you become a
[1:06:01] Christian?" He says, "Oh, well, Brother
[1:06:02] Brandham, I smoke these cigarettes. I
[1:06:04] don't know." And he says, "But Papa, why
[1:06:06] why don't you become a Christian?" He
[1:06:08] says, "I tell you what." He said,
[1:06:10] "Brother Brandham, I would become a
[1:06:12] Christian when I can get good enough."
[1:06:16] Go ahead. You know what brother Brandham
[1:06:19] said? I'll tell you what, Papa. You look
[1:06:21] around till you find where you can get
[1:06:23] good enough. Then tell me where that
[1:06:25] place is I want to go to.
[1:06:28] He says, "You'll never get to it that
[1:06:30] way." And he says, "Oh, I" He says, "Do
[1:06:32] you believe there is a God?" He says,
[1:06:33] "Yes, I believe as much as you do." He
[1:06:35] says, "Good." He says, ' Do you believe
[1:06:36] that that God came down and was made a
[1:06:38] man that he might pay the price for
[1:06:40] sins? He says, 'Well, yes I do.' He
[1:06:42] says, ' Then why don't you receive
[1:06:43] that?' He says, 'Oh, well, but these
[1:06:44] cigarettes, and brother Ram says, these
[1:06:47] cigarettes will take care of themselves.
[1:06:49] I'm not I'm asking you. I'm not a
[1:06:50] legalist. I believe in grace and all the
[1:06:53] father has come to me, the father has
[1:06:55] will give me. He says, if you believe
[1:06:57] that with all your heart, he said, with
[1:06:58] all my heart, I believe it. I said,
[1:07:00] 'Then will you accept it on those
[1:07:02] basises that you're not worthy of it?
[1:07:05] This is the way to receive every promise
[1:07:07] of God. Receive it on the basis that
[1:07:09] you're not worthy of it, but he's the
[1:07:12] one that's worthy. Don't look at
[1:07:14] yourself. Look at him. Cuz you ain't
[1:07:16] can't do nothing for yourself. Look at
[1:07:18] the one that did something for you. What
[1:07:21] about him? Oh, he said he's worthy. I
[1:07:25] said, that's it. Then accept what he
[1:07:27] gives you.
[1:07:28] took him to the water, baptized him in
[1:07:30] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. He
[1:07:31] got out of the water and he smoked
[1:07:33] another cigarette. But you know what? A
[1:07:34] little bit of time went by and there
[1:07:36] came a day where he never wanted to
[1:07:38] touch the things again. You see, he
[1:07:40] started out by accepting the grace of
[1:07:42] God in his life. And that grace and that
[1:07:44] mercy began to work out a good work in
[1:07:47] him. And if he'd ever tried to get there
[1:07:49] on his abilities, you know what? He'd
[1:07:52] still be working on it.
[1:07:55] Amen. So if it's if it's the grace of
[1:07:58] God, if it's the love of God that's been
[1:08:00] expressed, then we we get this question
[1:08:04] like, well, what makes me any different
[1:08:06] than anybody else? If it's not my
[1:08:08] abilities. Well, you're right. It's
[1:08:11] called grace. It's called his love. It's
[1:08:14] called his choosing on your life.
[1:08:17] prophet of God talks about the the bride
[1:08:20] being like a piece of fabric that a
[1:08:21] woman would lay a pattern over top and
[1:08:23] she'd lay that pattern on there and then
[1:08:25] she he says it's of her own choosing
[1:08:27] where she chooses to place that. She
[1:08:29] says I'm going to cut it out here and
[1:08:30] then she cuts it out. He says it's the
[1:08:32] same material. It's the same fabric.
[1:08:34] You're just as much human as anybody
[1:08:36] else. You're just as much of a a mortal
[1:08:38] as anybody else. But there's been an
[1:08:40] election. There's been a grace put on
[1:08:42] your life. And he said, "I choose this
[1:08:44] one. This is the one my elective love is
[1:08:47] placed upon. It's nothing you did to
[1:08:49] earn it. It's nothing you did to deserve
[1:08:51] it. It's called grace.
[1:08:54] Oh, what makes you different than anyone
[1:08:56] else? What makes you different from a
[1:08:58] vessel of mercy and a vessel of wrath
[1:09:00] fitted for destruction? What makes you
[1:09:02] different? The elective grace of God.
[1:09:07] Oh, if you think you have anything to do
[1:09:09] with it, then go back to Pharisee
[1:09:11] school. You haven't learned anything
[1:09:12] yet. Amen.
[1:09:14] Now, we're not here by an accident.
[1:09:16] We're not here by coincidence. It is the
[1:09:19] choosing of God, the love of God, the
[1:09:21] grace of God upon your life. And this
[1:09:24] grace doesn't just happen when you were
[1:09:27] here on earth and God just decided, you
[1:09:28] know what? I guess I'll take that one.
[1:09:30] No, this elective grace goes back before
[1:09:33] the foundation of the world. When the
[1:09:35] sons of God were shouting for joy, when
[1:09:37] they seen your name put on the lamb's
[1:09:39] book of life before the foundation of
[1:09:41] the world, it put a joy and a song in
[1:09:43] our heart then and it'll put a joy and a
[1:09:45] song in your heart now when you
[1:09:47] recognize that you've been a part of
[1:09:49] this from eternity. Prophet of God says
[1:09:52] an invisible union, he says your new
[1:09:54] life is in the lamb's book of life, your
[1:09:57] marriage certificate.
[1:10:00] You were where your true eternal germ
[1:10:02] from the beginning takes hold. You're
[1:10:04] not only forgiven, but you're justified.
[1:10:07] Justified. Your marriage certificate.
[1:10:09] So, your marriage certificate. What What
[1:10:11] is a marriage certificate? Well, we just
[1:10:12] signed one last weekend. Uh they put on
[1:10:15] there Justice Wallace. Alyssa. Alyssa
[1:10:18] McGary Wallace. And then there's some
[1:10:20] witnesses written down witnessing that
[1:10:22] this marriage took place, that the vows
[1:10:23] were made, and that there was a promise
[1:10:25] between them, that they would love one
[1:10:27] another. And you know what is very
[1:10:30] special about that marriage
[1:10:32] certificate for because they come they
[1:10:34] start out blank but by the time it's
[1:10:37] done there's names on that marriage
[1:10:38] certificate and that marriage
[1:10:41] certificate identifies a very specific
[1:10:44] person. Now you know to to to to you
[1:10:47] sister Ruth that marriage certificate
[1:10:49] might not mean a lot because you know
[1:10:50] what it don't have your name on it. If
[1:10:53] that marriage certificate don't have
[1:10:54] your name on it, it really doesn't mean
[1:10:56] a lot to you.
[1:10:59] But when you see that lamb's book of
[1:11:02] life and it opens up, that opening of
[1:11:04] the word began to reveal identities that
[1:11:07] were a part of this from the foundation
[1:11:08] of the world and you can look in there
[1:11:11] and you can read that marriage
[1:11:13] certificate. Who is the lamb's wife? Who
[1:11:15] is this bride? And you look in there and
[1:11:18] you read your name there on that
[1:11:19] marriage certificate. Oh, brother,
[1:11:21] sister, it takes all the worry, all the
[1:11:23] fear, all the nervousness. You're
[1:11:25] resting in his grace. You're resting in
[1:11:27] his elective love on your life that was
[1:11:30] placed there before the foundation of
[1:11:32] the world. So, how could you miss it?
[1:11:36] Impossible. Not one name that was on
[1:11:38] that book will ever miss being a part of
[1:11:42] this bride of Jesus Christ. It's your
[1:11:44] marriage certificate. Amen. So, you
[1:11:47] begin to understand why. Because that
[1:11:49] marriage certificate, that lamb's book
[1:11:50] of life, it was sealed up. But this
[1:11:52] message God sent in this last hour. He
[1:11:54] sent that seven sealed book open down to
[1:11:57] man so that that prophet could reveal it
[1:11:59] to the people. That's why it's so
[1:12:02] important. That's why us preachers are
[1:12:03] always talking about the seals coming
[1:12:05] open and what's going on. It's because
[1:12:07] it gives you a position and it gives you
[1:12:09] a rapturing faith. You look at how many
[1:12:11] times brother Bam talks about that
[1:12:12] opening of the word, that third pole,
[1:12:14] that that that those thunders being what
[1:12:16] gives the rapturing faith. And and I
[1:12:18] want to read here uh in the first first
[1:12:21] uh seal he says uh but when it started
[1:12:24] to write those other seven thunders he
[1:12:26] said don't write it. He'd been
[1:12:28] commissioned to write everything he
[1:12:29] seen. But when he seen seven thunders
[1:12:31] over in Revelations 10 uttered he said
[1:12:34] don't write them at all. They're
[1:12:35] mysteries. We don't know what they are
[1:12:38] yet. This is the first seal. We don't
[1:12:40] know what they are yet but my opinion
[1:12:42] they'll be revealed right away. And when
[1:12:44] it do, it'll give faith for that
[1:12:47] rapturing grace for that church to move
[1:12:50] out. Faith for rapturing grace. Brother
[1:12:53] Brandt talks about rapturing faith about
[1:12:55] 30 times, rapturing grace about 15
[1:12:57] times. And a and I want you just to look
[1:12:59] at this faith for grace.
[1:13:02] Now, if if uh if if if somebody uh let's
[1:13:07] see, let's see. You're not married back
[1:13:10] there, right? What are you?
[1:13:13] What's uh is it Rose?
[1:13:16] Mariah. Anyway, so Mariah, if somebody
[1:13:20] comes up to you, some fine-looking young
[1:13:22] man, and he comes up to you and he says,
[1:13:24] "You know what? You're the most
[1:13:26] beautiful girl in the whole world to
[1:13:28] me." He says, "Mariah, I I just love you
[1:13:31] so much. I want to spend more time with
[1:13:33] you." Now, there's a question. Do you
[1:13:36] believe
[1:13:37] him? If you don't believe him, if you
[1:13:40] don't have faith in what he's saying,
[1:13:42] then you're not going to believe or
[1:13:43] receive the grace or the favor that he's
[1:13:46] expressing to
[1:13:48] you. And how many times have we heard
[1:13:51] God's love letter expressed in this
[1:13:53] hour? And we're like, but do I really
[1:13:57] believe he's talking about me?
[1:13:59] You have to have a faith for this grace.
[1:14:02] You have to have a faith to receive this
[1:14:05] favor. And it's such an incredible
[1:14:07] favor. You know, we're here in our
[1:14:08] filthy rags. We're here in our sin. And
[1:14:11] he comes to us and he begins to express
[1:14:13] love to us. Not when we were cleaned up,
[1:14:15] but while we were in sin and while we
[1:14:17] were in darkness and and all of the
[1:14:20] filth of the world. That's when God so
[1:14:22] loved us that he gave his only begotten
[1:14:24] son. God's love for us was not when we
[1:14:26] were brought up and made up into the
[1:14:28] righteousness of God. He loved us while
[1:14:30] we were a sinner.
[1:14:33] Oh, and we have such a hard time
[1:14:35] receiving that kind of love. We just
[1:14:38] say, "I just can't believe that he means
[1:14:40] that about me." But you see this this
[1:14:43] opening of the word, this opening of the
[1:14:46] seals, it began to open up to us a faith
[1:14:50] for this grace. We began to have a
[1:14:52] confidence. Hey, I've been a part of
[1:14:54] this. God, God chose me before the
[1:14:57] foundation of the world. I read my name
[1:14:59] right there written in the book. John
[1:15:01] looked in and he seen his name. That's
[1:15:03] the bride. Says, "I'm a part of this."
[1:15:05] Brother Mary says another place. He
[1:15:06] looked beyond the curtain of time and he
[1:15:08] said, "Why there's John?" You see, when
[1:15:10] you realize that you're a part of this
[1:15:12] and it gives you such a faith to receive
[1:15:15] that grace, faith for that rapturing
[1:15:19] grace for that church to move out.
[1:15:23] This message of the hour has identified
[1:15:25] you. It has placed you and it has told
[1:15:27] you what belongs to you. The prophet
[1:15:30] says here in visible union he says just
[1:15:32] like I said that little eagle when he
[1:15:34] heard the bridegroom's voice that's what
[1:15:37] this message of the hour is when he
[1:15:39] heard that bridegroom's voice he went to
[1:15:41] it the anointed vindicated word of God
[1:15:45] for the last day
[1:15:47] speak brother man speaks over here in uh
[1:15:50] Christ mystery of God revealed and he's
[1:15:51] talking about how it's the love secret
[1:15:53] of God being expressed to his bride and
[1:15:57] how he's just he's sharing he's this
[1:15:59] this love secret with her. He says,
[1:16:00] "What what was once in God's mind is now
[1:16:04] in the body of Christ, Jesus making love
[1:16:07] to the church, his bride, whispering
[1:16:09] secrets to her." Amen. Praise the Lord.
[1:16:13] Oh friends, when we recognize the love
[1:16:15] of God that has been expressed to us and
[1:16:18] he says you know he says I mean I mean
[1:16:20] to his wife and and you know by having
[1:16:22] the revelation of his secret made known
[1:16:25] to them by his grace. Oh how the grace
[1:16:28] of God revealing these love secrets to
[1:16:32] her beginning to express these things to
[1:16:33] her. And so I I all of this here I'm
[1:16:37] kind of setting as as the background as
[1:16:39] the premise of of where I want to move
[1:16:42] into. When we realize the love of God,
[1:16:44] when we realize his grace for us, how
[1:16:47] incredible it is, then it ought to
[1:16:49] respond back. There ought to be
[1:16:52] something move on the inside of us
[1:16:54] because God sent us a message to
[1:16:56] declare. It's a love letter. He sent us
[1:16:58] a bridegroom's voice. That's what this
[1:17:00] message of the hour is. It's the
[1:17:02] bridegroom's voice. It's expressing his
[1:17:04] love to us and yet I feel so many times
[1:17:06] we sit there and we just don't really
[1:17:09] pay it any attention. We don't give it
[1:17:11] the love and the response back that it's
[1:17:14] worthy of. But if you can catch a vision
[1:17:17] of the love of God, that that love of
[1:17:19] God, how rich and pure, that love of God
[1:17:21] that's measurless and strong, and how if
[1:17:25] we could if we were to write the love of
[1:17:26] God, it would it would drain the ocean
[1:17:28] dry. and the sky could not hold the tale
[1:17:31] of the love of God. We could speak all
[1:17:33] of the this this service just about that
[1:17:35] love of God. But I I pray that the Lord
[1:17:37] has been able to quicken to you about
[1:17:39] that love. But I want to talk now. We've
[1:17:42] been talking about his love for us. Now
[1:17:44] I want to talk about our love back to
[1:17:47] him.
[1:17:50] Abraham says here
[1:17:52] now some of you haven't loved him like
[1:17:55] you should. Some of you are real,
[1:17:58] honorable Christians and you haven't
[1:18:01] loved him like you ought to. You know,
[1:18:04] you're guilty and you don't pray enough.
[1:18:06] I'm going to put my hand up now. I don't
[1:18:08] pray enough and I'm ashamed of myself,
[1:18:11] of my life. I I asked him to come to
[1:18:13] this meeting and I'm ashamed of my life
[1:18:15] before him. I'm ashamed of my life
[1:18:18] before Jesus. Bless his heart. He came
[1:18:20] from heaven this morning to visit us,
[1:18:23] come to us, talk to us, to speak to us.
[1:18:25] He is speaking us right now that still
[1:18:28] small voice down in our
[1:18:30] heart. And I friends, I don't want to I
[1:18:33] don't want you to get a negative idea,
[1:18:35] but I want to express it like this. And
[1:18:38] how I believe you love the Lord, and
[1:18:40] that's good, but I believe you ought to
[1:18:42] love him a little more. I believe you
[1:18:45] love the Lord. I believe you have a
[1:18:46] relationship with him. But if if I could
[1:18:49] put it in this context of of my personal
[1:18:52] experience, you know, I love my wife and
[1:18:54] and I I really appreciate her and I love
[1:18:56] her, but every once in a while she sits
[1:18:59] down with me and she reminds me, listen,
[1:19:02] you know, if you love me, you need to
[1:19:04] talk to me. Anybody ever had that
[1:19:07] conversation? You know, and I do love my
[1:19:10] wife, but I get busy and I get busy
[1:19:12] about all my my business and my work and
[1:19:15] my traveling and whatever's going on.
[1:19:17] and and I don't maybe spend the time
[1:19:20] with her that I ought to. It's not
[1:19:22] because I don't love her, but I it just
[1:19:25] something just needs a little bit of a a
[1:19:27] refocusing.
[1:19:29] And that's how I want to approach the
[1:19:30] church this morning. I'm not saying you
[1:19:32] don't love the Lord. But are you
[1:19:35] spending the time with him like you
[1:19:36] ought to? Are you spending the time to
[1:19:39] talk it over with
[1:19:40] him? Oh, the prophet of God, he says,
[1:19:43] "I'm ashamed of myself cuz I don't pray
[1:19:45] enough." And friends, I I know that's a
[1:19:48] a true testimony of my life. I don't
[1:19:51] spend the time talking to him like I
[1:19:53] ought to in that real love relationship
[1:19:55] of just a fellowship with him. I love
[1:19:58] him. I really do in my
[1:20:00] heart, but I need to spend more time
[1:20:02] with him.
[1:20:05] The unwelcomed Christ, Bill Ram says,
[1:20:07] she came up and she said, "I want the
[1:20:09] best alabaster box you got in the store.
[1:20:12] I want the best you got." And she clinks
[1:20:14] the money down. Oh, when he's seen the
[1:20:16] money, it's different now. I want the
[1:20:19] best you got. He is worthy of the best.
[1:20:23] What do you do for him? Give him the
[1:20:25] leftover. Oh, yes. You run around all
[1:20:27] day and you give him three minutes at
[1:20:29] night before you go to bed. Jesus
[1:20:32] deserves your best friend. He deserves
[1:20:34] everything you got. But what do you do
[1:20:37] about it? You give him just anything. He
[1:20:40] takes it. He takes it anyhow. He takes
[1:20:42] it. But but she said, "I want the best."
[1:20:45] And it cost her everything she had to
[1:20:48] give the best. But that's what you want
[1:20:50] to do. Give your best to give him your
[1:20:53] best. Give him the best of your life.
[1:20:56] Give him the best of your songs. Give
[1:20:58] him all your talent. Give him everything
[1:21:00] you got. Give him your feet. Give him
[1:21:03] your hands. Give him your eyes. Give him
[1:21:05] your mouth. Give him your ears. Give him
[1:21:07] your soul. Give him your heart. Give him
[1:21:10] your praise. Give him everything you
[1:21:12] got. Hallelujah. He deserving of the
[1:21:16] best.
[1:21:18] I ask you again like you asked Papa Cox,
[1:21:21] what about him? Is he worthy? He's
[1:21:25] worthy. He's worthy of our praise. He's
[1:21:27] worthy of our service. He's worthy of
[1:21:29] our time. prophet of God said in in I
[1:21:33] think it was enticing spirits. He says,
[1:21:34] "You show me a man, a a housewife, a a
[1:21:38] farmer, a a mechanic, a preacher that
[1:21:40] will put God first." He said, "I'll show
[1:21:44] you a man that'll be successful in spite
[1:21:46] of everything the devil tries to do to
[1:21:47] him. You want the equation for success?"
[1:21:50] That's right. Give God your best.
[1:21:54] Place him first.
[1:21:57] Hearing
[1:22:01] Abraham says here in testimony, he says,
[1:22:04] "The world's at the end of the age." And
[1:22:06] he breaks right into this. He was going
[1:22:07] a different direction. He breaks into
[1:22:09] this. He says, "The world's at the end
[1:22:10] of the age. Only in Christ are you
[1:22:12] saved." And I'm not saying that to scare
[1:22:14] you. I'm saying that just as sainely as
[1:22:17] I know how to stand here in this
[1:22:18] platform and say it. But my heart's been
[1:22:20] stirred for a time. And I know that
[1:22:22] we're ready for something now. Come in.
[1:22:25] And you Christians don't stay in that
[1:22:27] lukewarm condition anymore. You lay
[1:22:30] aside everything. Just get as close to
[1:22:33] God as you can. Walk with him. Talk with
[1:22:35] him. Let everything else be secondary
[1:22:39] but your prayer life.
[1:22:42] Stay right with him all the time. Now, I
[1:22:45] don't know why I stopped in my speech to
[1:22:46] say that, but I could prove that. I'd be
[1:22:48] willing to say that that's the spirit of
[1:22:50] God that's speaking right now. A warning
[1:22:51] to you. That's right. Remember, I'm
[1:22:54] saying that under the anointing of the
[1:22:56] spirit of God,
[1:22:58] let everything else be secondary, but
[1:23:01] your prayer life. You see, your prayer
[1:23:04] life is putting God first. It's your
[1:23:08] relationship with him. It's your
[1:23:09] fellowship with him. Let everything else
[1:23:12] be
[1:23:14] secondary but your prayer life. But
[1:23:19] friends, how many times does that end up
[1:23:21] fourth, fifth, sixth place way back down
[1:23:23] on the back burner because well, we can
[1:23:27] get by with it. We can He He's not going
[1:23:31] to strike us
[1:23:36] dead, but he wants fellowship.
[1:23:42] He's not angry at you. He's lonely.
[1:23:48] He wants to have a relationship with
[1:23:50] you. He wants to have a friendship and a
[1:23:53] fellowship with you. And he's just
[1:23:55] waiting to hear your voice. Come to him
[1:23:57] and and speak to him and commune to him.
[1:24:00] He's longing for that fellowship.
[1:24:02] Amenise. But we're too busy chasing
[1:24:05] after money or whatever other nonsense
[1:24:07] we have in this lukewarm leodyian age of
[1:24:10] riches and increased with goods that we
[1:24:12] don't got time for the lovely Lord
[1:24:14] Jesus.
[1:24:17] Everything else secondary but your
[1:24:20] prayer life.
[1:24:23] Oh, how we should have such a sincere
[1:24:26] love for him and just a desire to be in
[1:24:29] fellowship with him.
[1:24:32] But I I want to bring that down a little
[1:24:34] more personal. In John
[1:24:38] 13:34, he said, "A new commandment I
[1:24:40] give you, that you love one another as I
[1:24:43] have loved you, and that you also love
[1:24:46] one another. By this shall all men know
[1:24:49] that you are my disciples, if you have
[1:24:52] love one to another." Amen.
[1:24:56] Let's get our Bibles and let's turn over
[1:24:58] to the book of First John. I want to
[1:25:01] read a portion of scripture here. And I
[1:25:04] know this might not be maybe standard
[1:25:06] preaching, but I believe it's what the
[1:25:08] Lord put on my heart this
[1:25:10] morning. First John the 4th
[1:25:16] chapter
[1:25:17] verse verse 7 here. He says,
[1:25:21] "Beloved," 1 John 4:7, "Beloved, let us
[1:25:24] love one another, for love is of God,
[1:25:28] and everyone that loveth is born of God
[1:25:30] and knoweth God. He that loveth not
[1:25:33] knoweth not God, for God is love." In
[1:25:36] this was manifested the love of God
[1:25:39] toward us, because that God sent his
[1:25:41] only begotten son into the world, that
[1:25:43] we might live through him. Do you see
[1:25:47] that the manifestation of love is the
[1:25:50] sacrifice? If you love, there will be a
[1:25:53] sacrifice. Here in his love, not that we
[1:25:56] loved God, but that he loved us and sent
[1:25:59] his son to be the propitiation for our
[1:26:01] sins. Beloved, if God so loved us, we
[1:26:05] ought also to love one another. Amen. No
[1:26:08] man hath seen God at any time. If we
[1:26:11] love one another, God dwelleth in us,
[1:26:12] and his love is perfected in us. Hereby
[1:26:15] know we that we dwell in him and he in
[1:26:18] us because he hath given his us of his
[1:26:21] spirit. And we have seen and do testify
[1:26:24] that the father sent the son to be the
[1:26:26] savior of the world. Whosoever shall
[1:26:28] confess that Jesus is the son of God,
[1:26:31] God dwelleth in him, and he in God. And
[1:26:34] we have known and believed the love that
[1:26:37] God hath to us. God is love, and he that
[1:26:42] dwelleth in love dwelleth in God, and
[1:26:45] God in him. Amen. Herein is our love
[1:26:48] made perfect, that we may have boldness
[1:26:50] in the day of judgment, because as he
[1:26:52] is, so are we in this world. There is no
[1:26:57] fear in love, but perfect love casteth
[1:27:00] out fear. Because fear hath torment, and
[1:27:03] he that fearth is not made perfect in
[1:27:06] love. We love him because he first love
[1:27:10] us. And if a man say, "I love God," and
[1:27:13] hateth his brother, he is a liar. For he
[1:27:16] that loveth not his brother whom he hath
[1:27:18] seen, how can he love God whom he hath
[1:27:21] not seen? And this commandment have we
[1:27:24] from him, that he who loveth God love
[1:27:28] his brother also. Amen. Now, we we
[1:27:32] received a great revelation in this hour
[1:27:34] through the through the message of the
[1:27:36] hour that's declared to us that the body
[1:27:38] of Christ is on this earth right now.
[1:27:40] This bride is the incarnate body of
[1:27:45] Christ. And if you say you love God,
[1:27:49] but you don't love your brother,
[1:27:52] you're
[1:27:53] lying. You say, "Oh, I believe this
[1:27:55] great revelation of the hour, this great
[1:27:58] message of the hour. It's told us that
[1:27:59] the deity is not in heaven, it's in
[1:28:01] earth, it's in us. But then if it's in
[1:28:05] us, us is not just me. Us includes
[1:28:09] brother Amos. It's in us. And now if I'm
[1:28:12] wanting to do something for God, if I'm
[1:28:15] wanting to express my love to God,
[1:28:20] but I don't love my
[1:28:21] brother, I'm lying.
[1:28:26] You
[1:28:27] cannot truly have a love relationship
[1:28:30] with God and hate your brother.
[1:28:33] Amen. You see, you can have a religion
[1:28:36] and hate your brother. You can have a
[1:28:38] religion and crucify the Lord of glory.
[1:28:40] But if you really love the Lord, you'll
[1:28:43] love your brother. Amen. Amen. I I feel
[1:28:46] like so many times we get into this this
[1:28:50] this this uh approach of of the
[1:28:53] Pharisees and and how we begin to
[1:28:57] measure each other. We begin to measure
[1:28:59] Go ahead. We begin to measure one
[1:29:00] another. We begin to look at at Brother
[1:29:02] Amos and and what's your name,
[1:29:04] brother? Brother Bill. We begin to look
[1:29:07] at Brother Amos and Brother Bill and we
[1:29:08] begin to put little marks on the chart
[1:29:10] on where how they're doing. Well, you
[1:29:12] know, Brother Amos, he's over here and
[1:29:13] Brother Bill's over there and and we
[1:29:15] begin to measure each other and and we
[1:29:17] begin to judge one another and see how
[1:29:19] they're doing and and we begin to think,
[1:29:21] well, you know, he's getting up here and
[1:29:22] that one's down there. Well, you know
[1:29:24] what that is? That's a bunch of pigs
[1:29:26] laying in the mud calling each other
[1:29:28] filthy.
[1:29:30] They're all filthy. There's not one of
[1:29:32] you that are righteous. There's not one
[1:29:34] of you that have any merit. And you want
[1:29:36] to look over at your brother and condemn
[1:29:38] him because he's a failure and he's a
[1:29:40] sinner. Well, brother, sister, you are
[1:29:42] no better than them. There is not one
[1:29:44] good thing about you. What is good about
[1:29:47] you is the grace of God that has come to
[1:29:49] you and that was not your merit. That's
[1:29:51] not what you deserve. So why do we stand
[1:29:54] here judging our brother and condemning
[1:29:55] our brother? Hey, I recognize they made
[1:29:57] mistakes, but you know what? I made
[1:29:59] them, too. I recognize that they have
[1:30:01] failures, but I have them, too. There's
[1:30:03] not one good thing about me, but I've
[1:30:05] accepted the blood of Jesus Christ, and
[1:30:07] I'm pleading that same blood over my
[1:30:10] brother that the grace of God would come
[1:30:12] upon him.
[1:30:14] Condemnation will never bring a brother
[1:30:16] out of the mud. Friends, that's not
[1:30:19] what's going to do it. And if you ever
[1:30:21] actually get into the presence of God,
[1:30:25] very true. Let me let me read this quote
[1:30:27] here. It's lengthy and I know you've
[1:30:29] already heard it probably a dozen times,
[1:30:32] but I'm here to stir up your memory.
[1:30:35] Brother man says, "If the devil can keep
[1:30:37] us separated and he's got us shooting at
[1:30:39] one another, why? He's got an open
[1:30:41] target anywhere he wants to shoot. And
[1:30:43] what's the use of shooting? We're
[1:30:44] shooting one another. So, he can just
[1:30:46] sit back and relax."
[1:30:50] He says, "You're doing the devil's job."
[1:30:52] He says, "But let me give you if I found
[1:30:54] grace in your sight through God," has
[1:30:57] the prophet found grace in your sight
[1:30:58] through God, have you recognized that
[1:31:01] he's a special voice to you? He says,
[1:31:03] "If I found grace in your sight through
[1:31:05] God, he says, then you if you want to be
[1:31:10] a blessing and get a blessing when a man
[1:31:12] has done you wrong and he's absolutely
[1:31:15] justly, I mean, he has done you wrong
[1:31:17] and you know that he's done you wrong.
[1:31:19] He's done you evil. Don't mention that.
[1:31:24] You take him to prayer before God. And
[1:31:27] don't take it in a way of just a selfish
[1:31:29] and say, "Well, I'm supposed to do
[1:31:31] this." You know, that's like my kids
[1:31:33] when I tell them, you know, say sorry
[1:31:35] and give each other a hug.
[1:31:37] Sorry. That's not what he's talking
[1:31:39] about. Don't take it selfishly. He says,
[1:31:42] "Not just I have to do this."
[1:31:46] He says, "But you stand there with your
[1:31:47] shoulder to his shoulder and stand in
[1:31:50] the presence of God our father." Way a
[1:31:53] prayer should be made in the presence of
[1:31:54] God and say, "Father, here's my brother
[1:31:58] and he justly he deserves punishment
[1:32:00] because he's he's done me evil and I
[1:32:02] don't see why he did it." Then let God
[1:32:05] go to talking to you. See, we're talking
[1:32:06] about real prayer right now. Prayer is a
[1:32:09] two-way conversation. Then let God go to
[1:32:11] talking to you and you'll see maybe what
[1:32:13] that man's been through. and the devil
[1:32:15] has twisted him up somewhere and caused
[1:32:17] him to do that. And though he's
[1:32:19] absolutely wrong before you leave the
[1:32:21] throne of God, you'll be feeling sorry
[1:32:23] for that man. You'll be sympathizing
[1:32:25] with that brother. And when you get back
[1:32:28] down here to
[1:32:30] earth, you'll go over to that brother
[1:32:33] and shake his hand because you know what
[1:32:35] he's been through. You cannot stand with
[1:32:38] a mortal in the presence of God and
[1:32:40] condemn anybody. I don't believe so. No
[1:32:44] sir. Even if he is a rank sinner. And
[1:32:47] what about a brother that's made a
[1:32:49] mistake. Though I say he's wrong,
[1:32:51] sometimes he's accused wrong when he's
[1:32:52] not wrong. But if he's wrong, well, if
[1:32:55] we'll take him to the throne of God,
[1:32:57] stand there shoulder-to-shoulder with
[1:32:59] our brother, knowing that he's immortal,
[1:33:02] and maybe his destination rests upon our
[1:33:05] attitude towards him. I'll pick up on
[1:33:08] that later. He says, "When we come back
[1:33:10] from the throne of God, we'll realize
[1:33:12] that we're everyone guilty. And we all
[1:33:15] need help one from another. And the best
[1:33:18] way to do is prayer."
[1:33:22] Well, friends, you can't artificially
[1:33:24] manufacture that kind of love. You can't
[1:33:27] do it. You know, I I try to encourage my
[1:33:30] kids to to be kind to one another and
[1:33:32] and to give each other a hug, but you
[1:33:34] know what? That's that's put on because
[1:33:37] it's not in the heart. But I'm just
[1:33:39] like, "Well, at least your actions are
[1:33:40] going to be what I want." You know, even
[1:33:41] if your heart's not there. And and you
[1:33:43] know, we do what we can. But you, you
[1:33:45] know, and I feel like so many times when
[1:33:47] we come to church and we begin to rub
[1:33:49] shoulders with a brother that rubs us
[1:33:50] the wrong way. You know what? That's
[1:33:53] exactly what God wanted. Because there's
[1:33:55] nothing that'll cut a diamond like a
[1:33:57] diamond.
[1:33:59] It takes the same material. There's
[1:34:02] nothing that can cut you to the heart
[1:34:03] like a brother.
[1:34:05] And God values that more than gold.
[1:34:11] God don't value things the way we do. He
[1:34:13] values character. There's nothing
[1:34:15] that'll cause you to develop character
[1:34:17] like a brother that just cuts you very
[1:34:19] deeply. But God's beginning to cut and
[1:34:21] he's beginning to cut that diamond until
[1:34:23] that light will begin to reflect all
[1:34:26] seven colors of the deity of Jesus
[1:34:27] Christ.
[1:34:30] Amen.
[1:34:32] Brother Bram says here in what does it
[1:34:34] take to make a Christian
[1:34:36] life? He says the Holy Spirit will make
[1:34:39] every movement like Christ. It'll make
[1:34:42] you Christlike. The fruits of the spirit
[1:34:44] is love, joy, peace, longsuffering,
[1:34:47] goodness, meekness, gentleness,
[1:34:48] patience, faith. Those things are what
[1:34:51] the Holy Spirit controls. Our emotions.
[1:34:55] Our emotions is not just so much as
[1:34:57] jumping up and down. You could do that
[1:34:58] at a shindig. We'll we'll bring that to
[1:35:00] you. But the Holy Spirit brings you into
[1:35:03] operation or in control of God that you
[1:35:06] walk in peace and in love and in joy
[1:35:11] with longsuffering, goodness, meekness,
[1:35:13] gentleness, patience. You see, it isn't
[1:35:16] something that you
[1:35:19] do. Wait,
[1:35:21] what? It's not something you do.
[1:35:25] No, it's not something that you do. It's
[1:35:28] something the Holy Spirit does in you.
[1:35:32] You see, it's no longer an intellectual
[1:35:34] thought of your own. It's a subconscious
[1:35:38] moving of the Holy Spirit.
[1:35:40] Oh friends, it's not you trying to
[1:35:42] manufacture up some righteousness. It's
[1:35:44] the righteousness coming down on the
[1:35:46] inside of you and now it's
[1:35:48] subconsciously expressing itself and
[1:35:50] you've got a love and you're expressing
[1:35:51] it to others without having to try to
[1:35:54] manufacture it or to bring it up. It's
[1:35:56] something God by the Holy Spirit's doing
[1:35:58] through you.
[1:36:00] Oh, you try to manufacture it. And and
[1:36:02] you know, I really do think you should
[1:36:04] try to be nice. Don't get me wrong. It
[1:36:06] would make your pastor's job a whole lot
[1:36:07] easier if you at least tried to be nice.
[1:36:09] But you know, I'm telling you that
[1:36:11] that's not enough. That's not what God's
[1:36:13] looking for is just you trying to be
[1:36:15] nice. He wants the Holy Spirit to come
[1:36:17] down on the inside of you and make it a
[1:36:19] life express. Make it something that's
[1:36:21] just not an effort, not a I'm trying to
[1:36:23] produce some wool. No, no. You just got
[1:36:25] a sheep's nature inside of you and wool
[1:36:27] just becomes to grow out of every pore.
[1:36:32] Brother Bram
[1:36:34] says, "Well, yeah." He says, "Well,
[1:36:38] Brother Brandham, I can't live for this
[1:36:40] brother. I I can live for this brother
[1:36:42] because he's sure a nice man." Talking
[1:36:45] about loving your brother. Says, "I can
[1:36:47] live for this brother because he's sure
[1:36:49] a nice man." That's not it. You live for
[1:36:52] that man who hates you.
[1:36:54] live for that person who would kill you
[1:36:56] if they could. That's what they done to
[1:36:59] him. They killed him and he died that he
[1:37:02] might save them. That's eternal life.
[1:37:05] When you have that in your bosom, you're
[1:37:07] facing heaven then.
[1:37:11] Now, it's easy to be nice to nice
[1:37:13] people, but you know, there's people
[1:37:16] that aren't so nice. True. And God likes
[1:37:18] to have those people there so that he
[1:37:19] can rub you the wrong way. Sorry, you
[1:37:22] might be married to one. I don't know.
[1:37:24] But God did that for a very good reason.
[1:37:26] Somebody that can just rub you the wrong
[1:37:27] way so that you can find out that
[1:37:29] there's a few rough areas that the Holy
[1:37:31] Spirit don't have control of yet. And
[1:37:33] you can die out and you can surrender
[1:37:35] and say, "God, I want you to begin to
[1:37:37] work this out of me. I want you to begin
[1:37:38] to change this in me. I know I can't do
[1:37:41] this at my own ability. If I were to try
[1:37:43] and manufacture it, it would be nothing
[1:37:45] but filthy rags. But I'm asking that
[1:37:47] your Holy Spirit would come down on the
[1:37:49] inside of me and begin to express your
[1:37:51] nature." That's right. Oh, you know the
[1:37:54] brother Bham talks about somebody in
[1:37:56] question and answers and they say, you
[1:37:57] know, brother Brandham, you know, when
[1:37:58] somebody steps on my toes, my temper
[1:38:00] just gets to going and I want to
[1:38:02] overcome this. You know what he told
[1:38:05] him? Sweeten your temper with prayer.
[1:38:10] You get in the presence of God, you
[1:38:12] begin to die out. You begin to yield
[1:38:14] yourself. Then something comes down and
[1:38:16] begins to flow through you and you have
[1:38:19] a different nature.
[1:38:22] Now, I I want you to recognize that I'm
[1:38:25] not saying you don't have the Holy
[1:38:27] Spirit. But you know what? Many times
[1:38:29] the Holy Spirit isn't in control. We We
[1:38:32] take over the wheel again. And you know,
[1:38:34] when we do that, he just steps aside. He
[1:38:37] lets us. But if we'll just yield
[1:38:39] ourselves down, Paul called it dying
[1:38:42] daily. He says, "I die daily. I want him
[1:38:45] to have control. I don't want this old
[1:38:47] nature, this old flesh to raise up and
[1:38:49] take take control of my actions. I want
[1:38:51] to die out every single day. I want to
[1:38:54] be crucified with Christ. I'm dying
[1:38:57] daily that he might express himself and
[1:39:00] live through me.
[1:39:03] Amen.
[1:39:09] You know, when you begin to recognize
[1:39:12] the love of God for you, then there's a
[1:39:15] love that comes back from your heart
[1:39:16] towards God. And when that happens,
[1:39:19] you'll begin to love your fellow man.
[1:39:21] And not just the good man, not just the
[1:39:24] people that are at church. You'll have a
[1:39:26] burden for the sinner.
[1:39:29] Go back some years ago. I was doing some
[1:39:32] work at and and I I I went to light a
[1:39:36] little fire in the stove because it was
[1:39:37] kind of cold in the basement and it was
[1:39:39] in the fall. Hadn't had really any fires
[1:39:42] that year and I just was a little
[1:39:43] chilly. So I wanted to warm it up. So, I
[1:39:45] I put a little bit of wood in there and
[1:39:47] a little bit of paper and I lit it up
[1:39:49] and and there was a little sparrow that
[1:39:51] had gotten to the chimney and that bird
[1:39:54] came down and he crashed down into that
[1:39:56] fire and he was just flying every which
[1:39:58] way trying to get out and I opened the
[1:40:01] door. I was trying to figure out how to
[1:40:02] get him out of that fire and and I
[1:40:04] couldn't I couldn't figure out how to
[1:40:05] get it. So, I I tried to grab a stick
[1:40:07] and maybe just, you know, just hit him
[1:40:08] real hard. just just put him out of it,
[1:40:10] you know, cuz he was just right there in
[1:40:12] all them
[1:40:13] flames. And I couldn't I couldn't I
[1:40:15] couldn't stop him. I couldn't, you know,
[1:40:17] give him a merciful death. I couldn't
[1:40:18] kill him. I I just had to leave the
[1:40:20] room. I couldn't take it. Seeing that
[1:40:22] little bird all in the
[1:40:25] fire, it just bothered me. It burdened
[1:40:28] me. But friend, when you can realize the
[1:40:32] condition of your fellow man, when you
[1:40:35] can realize that they're they're hanging
[1:40:37] over a devil's hell and they're that
[1:40:39] they there's a people that has a need of
[1:40:41] you to express the grace and mercy of
[1:40:44] God to hit them and perhaps their
[1:40:46] eternal destination rests on your
[1:40:48] attitude toward them.
[1:40:51] True. When you realize that there's a
[1:40:54] there's a people, you know, Abraham was
[1:40:56] a part of God's economy. He was that
[1:40:58] elected body, but he had somebody that
[1:41:00] he cared about, which was a Lot. You
[1:41:03] never see where God really paid much
[1:41:05] attention to Lot, but Abraham cared
[1:41:07] about him. And so, he went out to battle
[1:41:08] against those kings and he brought him
[1:41:10] back. And it says in the scriptures that
[1:41:12] when God went to destroy Sodom that
[1:41:15] because of Abraham,
[1:41:18] he went and got Lot.
[1:41:20] And I believe that we are in that same
[1:41:22] position, we can have such a love for
[1:41:24] our fellow man. We can have such a
[1:41:26] burden for them that we can put our arm
[1:41:28] around them and and God will say, "Well,
[1:41:31] because of Zachary, I'm going to bring
[1:41:32] that one, too."
[1:41:36] Oh, if we could just recognize our
[1:41:38] position as sons of God to express mercy
[1:41:42] and grace to those around us and perhaps
[1:41:44] their eternal destination rests on your
[1:41:47] attitude toward them.
[1:41:49] Oh, it would put such a burden in our
[1:41:51] heart for the
[1:41:54] lost. prophet said and when love is
[1:41:57] projected he says until the burden gets
[1:41:59] on the Christian church for lost souls
[1:42:02] we're fighting the air let us stop
[1:42:04] speaking I believe in gifts and signs
[1:42:07] and wonders why certainly that goes with
[1:42:09] the body but let's not put that ahead of
[1:42:12] love and lost souls let's get into a
[1:42:15] burden on our hearts
[1:42:20] when the prophet of God went beyond the
[1:42:22] curtain of time and he got into that
[1:42:24] dimension And he was there and he
[1:42:26] realized what it was. He said, "Oh God,
[1:42:29] if I could go back to the earth, I'd
[1:42:30] compel them to come. I I' I'd search the
[1:42:33] lands. I' I'd bring everybody I possibly
[1:42:37] could." And he had that opportunity. You
[1:42:40] know, there was a rich young ruler one
[1:42:42] time. He went down and he went down to
[1:42:44] the pits of hell and he began to look
[1:42:46] around and he realized what condition he
[1:42:48] was in. And he began to have a burden
[1:42:50] for souls and he was like, "God, oh, if
[1:42:52] you let me go back, I would tell my
[1:42:54] brethren. Would you raise up somebody?
[1:42:56] Send somebody to tell my brethren not to
[1:42:58] go this
[1:43:00] way." But he'd passed that
[1:43:03] opportunity. He had an eternal
[1:43:05] perspective then of what really
[1:43:07] mattered.
[1:43:08] prophet of God after coming back from
[1:43:10] beyond the curtain of time. He says,
[1:43:11] "I'm more convinced than ever in my life
[1:43:13] that it will take perfect love to enter
[1:43:15] that place." There was no jealousy, no
[1:43:18] tiredness, no sickness, no old age, no
[1:43:20] death, only supreme beauty and joy. And
[1:43:23] whatever you do, lay aside everything
[1:43:26] else until you get perfect love. Get to
[1:43:29] where you can love everybody, every
[1:43:32] enemy. No matter in the if the plane is
[1:43:34] a rocking or the lightning is a flashing
[1:43:36] or or the gun of the enemy are upon you,
[1:43:39] those things do not matter. Get perfect
[1:43:43] love. Amen.
[1:43:48] Oh,
[1:43:51] friends, I I I'm so thankful for this
[1:43:54] message that expressed God's love to us.
[1:43:56] Amen. But what about our love to him?
[1:43:59] And what about our love to our brother?
[1:44:00] Because that's where the rubber meets
[1:44:02] the road. We say we love God, but how
[1:44:04] you treat your brother is the reality of
[1:44:08] what you're saying.
[1:44:10] You love God, and you ought to love one
[1:44:12] another.
[1:44:15] We've got to forsake everything, take up
[1:44:18] our cross, follow the Lord
[1:44:20] Jesus. And here in the sermon, where has
[1:44:23] thy strength gone, Samson?
[1:44:27] prophets talking about how the spirit of
[1:44:28] God would like to move in the church and
[1:44:30] bring great revival and and these
[1:44:32] things. And he says if they would there
[1:44:34] would be no cripples or afflictions
[1:44:35] around us if we would confess our sins.
[1:44:37] And you say our sins? Well, I don't do
[1:44:40] anything wrong. I don't drink. I that's
[1:44:43] not it. It's neglection sometimes. It's
[1:44:46] not moving up with God. It's not doing
[1:44:49] in the Holy Spirit. It's not it's it's
[1:44:51] not watering what that God has given
[1:44:54] you, you're grieving it away.
[1:44:58] He said, if it to to see a a greater
[1:45:01] manifestation of God, then stop
[1:45:04] neglecting what God's doing in your
[1:45:07] midst. Stop neglecting the Holy Spirit
[1:45:09] calling you to come up higher. The Holy
[1:45:11] Spirit has has done things for you, and
[1:45:12] you're supposed to be watering that and
[1:45:14] growing that and just and just growing
[1:45:17] greater in the grace of God. And yet
[1:45:19] we're neglecting it because we got so
[1:45:21] many other cares of life that we're
[1:45:23] paying our attention to. He says in
[1:45:24] doing that, you're grieving it
[1:45:27] away over here and make the valley full
[1:45:30] of ditches. He says the other night when
[1:45:31] I was coming over here, the Lord met me
[1:45:34] in the room and just a vision the same
[1:45:36] as you see here at the platform and he
[1:45:38] said, "Here's what's the matter with the
[1:45:40] church. They've got so much selfishness
[1:45:43] everywhere." He didn't just say this.
[1:45:45] The church of the living God has got so
[1:45:48] much differences and so much this and
[1:45:50] that till they grieve the Holy Spirit
[1:45:52] away from them. That's just exactly what
[1:45:54] it is. And brother and sisters, until we
[1:45:57] humble ourselves and become the lamb so
[1:46:01] the dove can light on us again and bring
[1:46:04] joy and peace and satisfaction and a
[1:46:07] burning desire in our hearts to see
[1:46:09] others saved and come to God, we're
[1:46:12] simply fighting the winds.
[1:46:15] Do you realize he didn't say so that the
[1:46:17] Holy Spirit can come the first time? He
[1:46:19] says you come down. You humble yourself.
[1:46:21] You become a lamb again and he'll come
[1:46:24] back again. You see, because there's a
[1:46:26] there's a lamb and a dove. There's a
[1:46:28] wolf nature. That's the that the human
[1:46:31] animal nature of you as a fallen
[1:46:34] creature is a wolf nature. And that wolf
[1:46:36] nature will drive away the Holy Spirit.
[1:46:39] But there is a power of the spirit of
[1:46:40] God to come and change you so that you
[1:46:43] can be a lamb nature. expressed. But if
[1:46:45] you grieve that Holy Spirit and you
[1:46:47] begin to go, "No, I've got my rights.
[1:46:49] I'm going to do my thing." Now, you're
[1:46:51] beginning to growl like a wolf. And that
[1:46:53] Holy Spirit is pushed away from you. He
[1:46:55] says, "But if you'll just come and
[1:46:57] humble yourself back again." Amen.
[1:47:01] It's dying daily. Amen. He says, "Come
[1:47:04] back to being a lamb again. Come back to
[1:47:07] be gentle. Come back to knowing nothing.
[1:47:10] Coming back just to submit yourself to
[1:47:12] Christ. Don't try to know to to know
[1:47:15] nothing. Just walk meekly, quietly,
[1:47:17] humbly, gently, and the dove will lead
[1:47:20] you. But when you see go to listening to
[1:47:22] that gossip, whatever you got to getting
[1:47:25] that temper up, whenever you get to
[1:47:27] thinking that you got a right to do this
[1:47:28] and that, the dove just takes her flight
[1:47:31] and goes on away. Then you don't have it
[1:47:34] anymore.
[1:47:36] I'm afraid we get used to that.
[1:47:40] We say, "Oh, well, that was just when I
[1:47:42] was enthused back as a young person."
[1:47:45] No. He says, "Now, she's not very far
[1:47:48] from you this morning, church. She's
[1:47:51] sitting right out there on the limb of
[1:47:53] peace, waiting for your nature to be
[1:47:56] changed.
[1:48:05] Do we love him?
[1:48:07] We say we do and I believe it. I really
[1:48:10] do. But do we spend that time with him
[1:48:14] talking to him like we ought to.
[1:48:16] Friends, I'm I'm I'm here as a checkup
[1:48:18] this morning. We love him, then we ought
[1:48:21] to talk to him. We ought to spend time
[1:48:23] with him. We love him, then we ought to
[1:48:25] love our brother. If we say we love our
[1:48:28] God and we don't love our brother,
[1:48:31] you're a liar. If you say you want to
[1:48:33] have fellowship with God and you don't
[1:48:34] want to have fellowship with your
[1:48:36] brother, you're a liar. That doesn't
[1:48:39] just mean people in your
[1:48:41] church. You see, God is expressing
[1:48:45] himself in a people. And if you really
[1:48:48] want to serve God, do something for your
[1:48:50] brother. If you really want to love God,
[1:48:52] then there ought to be a love in your
[1:48:53] heart for your brother. You really want
[1:48:55] to have fellowship with God, then you
[1:48:56] ought to have a desire for fellowship
[1:48:59] with your brother.
[1:49:01] You see, God's not off a million miles
[1:49:03] away somewhere. He's in a body. He's in
[1:49:06] a people, the bride of Jesus Christ.
[1:49:11] And instead of us looking at one another
[1:49:13] and and and seeing all the the mud on
[1:49:16] one another and oh well, this one's
[1:49:18] guilty or that one's guilty, you're
[1:49:20] right. You know, a critical spirit
[1:49:22] really is usually correct, but it's
[1:49:25] still a critical spirit from hell.
[1:49:26] Right?
[1:49:29] You see, they brought a woman to Jesus
[1:49:30] one
[1:49:31] time. They said, "She's wrong." She was.
[1:49:36] But you know what Jesus
[1:49:38] did? He says, "Whoever doesn't have sin
[1:49:40] in their life, let him be the one that
[1:49:42] condemns
[1:49:44] her." And every one of them turned
[1:49:46] around and walked away when they
[1:49:48] realized that they were fallen and
[1:49:50] broken just like she was. That's right.
[1:49:55] But you know there was one there that
[1:49:56] could have condemned her and he said go
[1:50:00] and sin no more.
[1:50:04] You see he is nature his nature
[1:50:08] expresses grace. His nature expresses
[1:50:10] mercy. In this hour we received a
[1:50:13] message that came down from heavens with
[1:50:14] shoutings crying grace grace.
[1:50:19] But we can look at one another through
[1:50:21] our human eyes and we can see the
[1:50:22] faults. We can see the failures. Brother
[1:50:24] Brandham tells that story about how he
[1:50:26] went to that to that restaurant one time
[1:50:28] and he walked in the door and seen the
[1:50:31] police officer with his arm around a
[1:50:32] woman playing a slot machine. So here's
[1:50:35] here's the the middle-aged man breaking
[1:50:37] the law and just degraded. And he looks
[1:50:39] over and there's a table of of young men
[1:50:41] with a girl just behaving so immorally.
[1:50:43] And he says, "There's the young people.
[1:50:45] They're gone." And he looks over and
[1:50:47] here's an old grandma sitting there with
[1:50:49] little bitty shorts on and and painted
[1:50:51] blue lips and blue blue toenails and
[1:50:54] black ey brows and just all painted up
[1:50:56] and the sweat was running down her face
[1:50:58] and the pain was all running down just a
[1:50:59] a horrible look inside. And he looks at
[1:51:02] her and he says, "God, why don't you
[1:51:04] just blast the whole thing off the
[1:51:05] earth?" Just sitting there drinking and
[1:51:06] he says, "Why don't you just rake the
[1:51:08] whole thing
[1:51:10] off?" He says, "And I heard something
[1:51:12] say come behind the door." He says, 'Th
[1:51:14] that was my boss
[1:51:15] speaking. So I stepped behind the door
[1:51:19] and he began to see a world turning and
[1:51:23] he began to see around that world was a
[1:51:25] was a bumper, a shroud of the blood of
[1:51:27] Jesus Christ. And he would see himself
[1:51:30] doing things that weren't right and as
[1:51:31] those sins would go up towards the
[1:51:33] throne of God, if that ever came before
[1:51:36] the throne of God, he would be
[1:51:38] destroyed. But Jesus Christ with that
[1:51:40] bumper of blood would reach out and
[1:51:41] catch it. And he said, and he would jerk
[1:51:43] and the blood would fly off his face and
[1:51:44] he'd he'd cry. He'd say, "Father,
[1:51:47] forgive him." He don't know what he's
[1:51:48] doing. He said, "And I'd see another
[1:51:51] thing coming up before and there would
[1:51:52] go and strike the Lord Jesus and he'd
[1:51:55] wse and he'd he'd cry out and he'd say,
[1:51:56] "Father, forgive him." Yes. He says, "I
[1:52:01] seen that and I've seen a book written
[1:52:03] and it had all my deeds written out, all
[1:52:05] of the sin I'd done, everything I was
[1:52:08] guilty of written there." And he was
[1:52:09] looking at that. He says, "Oh," he says,
[1:52:11] "Oh, Lord Jesus, is that my sin that's
[1:52:13] causing you to be hurt like that?" He
[1:52:16] said, "Yes." He says, "Oh, I'm sorry,
[1:52:19] Lord, that I made you suffer like that.
[1:52:21] I'm sorry for my sins. Lord, would you
[1:52:23] forgive me?" He said, "And I seen him
[1:52:24] take his finger and dip it in his side
[1:52:26] and right across that book pardon." And
[1:52:29] he threw it behind him in that sea of
[1:52:31] forgetfulness and brought out a clean
[1:52:33] page, Lord. And then he looked at him
[1:52:37] and he said, "I freely forgave you
[1:52:42] freely. You didn't earn it. I freely
[1:52:44] forgave you and now you want to condemn
[1:52:47] her. You want to destroy her." He says,
[1:52:51] "And I failed about that little." Amen.
[1:52:54] And he walked over to her. And you know
[1:52:56] what the prophet says in one place? He
[1:52:58] says after that, it changed my attitude.
[1:53:01] It changed his attitude towards her. And
[1:53:04] now instead of being condemning and
[1:53:06] critical and wondering why God didn't
[1:53:08] destroy him, which she deserved it, she
[1:53:10] was worthy of it. She was dressed in
[1:53:12] filthy rags, friends, she deserved it.
[1:53:14] But instead of bringing condemnation,
[1:53:16] when his attitude changed towards her,
[1:53:19] he walked over to her and imparted
[1:53:21] eternal life to that sister by bringing
[1:53:23] her back to the Lord Jesus Christ. And
[1:53:25] he began to talk and he said, you know,
[1:53:27] will you forgive me?
[1:53:30] Yes. Forgive you? Well, what? He said,
[1:53:32] "Well, I was condemning
[1:53:34] you." He says, "But the Lord showed me
[1:53:38] that, you know, this condition." And she
[1:53:40] says, "Well, you know, I used to be
[1:53:41] married to a preacher. My daughters are
[1:53:44] Sunday school teachers. My husband died
[1:53:45] and all these different things she'd
[1:53:47] went through." She says, "But I'm too
[1:53:48] far gone, and I don't think he'd have me
[1:53:51] back." He said, "He wouldn't have told
[1:53:53] me, talked to me if you would couldn't
[1:53:55] have a way back." Amen. And they got
[1:53:58] down on the floor in the middle of that
[1:53:59] room and they began to pray and the slot
[1:54:02] machine kept stopped to play. The police
[1:54:04] officer took off his hat and those
[1:54:06] people began respectful and crying and
[1:54:08] the he led her back to the Lord. What
[1:54:10] happened? His attitude towards her
[1:54:13] changed
[1:54:15] and she's in heaven now because of that.
[1:54:18] Praise God. Oh friends, when we can
[1:54:20] recognize that God freely forgave us,
[1:54:24] then what about her? Amen. Oh, that's
[1:54:28] the story that Jesus tells in Matthew 18
[1:54:31] when he talks about these debtors who
[1:54:33] came and this man says, you know, pay
[1:54:35] what you owe. He says, I can't do it. I
[1:54:38] owe millions of dollars. I can't pay
[1:54:40] that debt. And the king says, well, then
[1:54:43] you deserve judgment. Which he did. And
[1:54:45] the man begged for mercy. And he says,
[1:54:48] 'I forgive you the debt. And then that
[1:54:50] man went out. It was just forgave
[1:54:52] millions of dollars. He goes out on the
[1:54:54] street and he finds a man that owes him
[1:54:55] 20 bucks and he says, "You pay me that
[1:54:57] money right now." He says, "I can't do
[1:54:58] it. Maybe next week." And he says, "No."
[1:55:00] And he throws him in jail for it.
[1:55:01] Condemns his brother because he couldn't
[1:55:03] pay him the 20 bucks when he owed
[1:55:04] millions and he was just forgiven. And
[1:55:07] you know what? When the king heard about
[1:55:11] that, he took that man and he threw him
[1:55:14] into the prison house with tormentors
[1:55:17] until he could pay everything he owed.
[1:55:20] Yes.
[1:55:22] And he told that man, he
[1:55:25] said, he says, "So likewise," Jesus
[1:55:28] says, "So likewise shall my heavenly
[1:55:30] father do also unto you, if you from
[1:55:34] your hearts forgive not everyone, his
[1:55:37] brother that trespasses."
[1:55:40] See, G Jesus was answering Peter a
[1:55:42] question. He says, "How many times do I
[1:55:45] have to forgive my brother? This lousy
[1:55:47] guy sinned against me seven times
[1:55:49] today." Jesus said,
[1:55:51] 'Well, 70 times
[1:55:53] seven, which uh Brother Wayne was
[1:55:56] preaching a little while ago. He says,
[1:55:57] 'Th that's about every two
[1:55:59] minutes. So he says, obviously there's
[1:56:02] going to be some people who are really
[1:56:03] offensive, but there's also these people
[1:56:05] that need to forgive a whole lot. So
[1:56:07] after about every two minutes, you got
[1:56:08] to let it go if you're going to keep up
[1:56:10] with the 70*
[1:56:12] 7. Peter was asking this question, and
[1:56:15] this is the story he told. He says, "If
[1:56:17] you want to be
[1:56:18] forgiven, if you want to be forgiven for
[1:56:20] your great debt, then what about the
[1:56:23] little little debt your brother owes
[1:56:25] you?" Amen. Let's stand to our feet this
[1:56:30] morning. Abraham says in the sermon,
[1:56:32] Lamb and the dove, if if you want to
[1:56:34] listen to a sermon that'll take you off
[1:56:36] your high horse, that's a good one. He
[1:56:38] says, "You remember that sweet peace
[1:56:40] that you used to have when you'd get
[1:56:43] alone with God, but that's all been
[1:56:45] taken away from you now. And why?
[1:56:48] Because you did something to grieve that
[1:56:50] dove away. You'll just come back to be a
[1:56:52] lamb and he will come
[1:56:55] back." You know, I is your bitterness
[1:56:58] such a great treasure that you'd rather
[1:56:59] keep that than the sweetness of the
[1:57:01] spirit of God? you know, is your is your
[1:57:04] critical spirits of so much worth to you
[1:57:06] that you'd rather have that than the
[1:57:07] Holy Spirit? You know, is our is our
[1:57:10] jobs and our ambition and our muddy of
[1:57:12] so much more worth and and our all of
[1:57:14] our earthly things of so much more value
[1:57:16] than to spend that time with our
[1:57:18] precious Lord Jesus? Well, no. No, it's
[1:57:22] not. I believe we should need to have a
[1:57:24] heart checkup this morning, friends. If
[1:57:26] I had a doctor, I'd get out that
[1:57:27] stethoscope and and I believe we just
[1:57:29] need to check up on our hearts this
[1:57:30] morning. Do we love him like we ought
[1:57:32] to? Do we love our brother like we say
[1:57:35] we love
[1:57:37] God? I believe we love him. I believe
[1:57:40] you have the Holy Spirit. But friends,
[1:57:42] don't let him sit on a branch
[1:57:45] somewhere. Make him welcome in your
[1:57:47] heart.
[1:57:49] Entertain his presence. I want you to
[1:57:51] think about if the Lord Jesus were
[1:57:53] sitting in your room when you woke up
[1:57:55] tomorrow morning and you seen him
[1:57:56] sitting over there in the chair. Would
[1:57:58] you just say, "Good morning. I got to go
[1:58:00] to work." work or would you spend a
[1:58:01] little bit of time to worship him? Would
[1:58:04] you spend a little bit of time to
[1:58:05] entertain his presence and thank him for
[1:58:07] his goodness to you? I believe if we
[1:58:10] were conscious that he's there, we'd
[1:58:13] take a moment to worship
[1:58:17] him. He's worthy of it. Amen. He's
[1:58:20] worthy of our love. When you realize his
[1:58:23] love to us, oh, it just there because he
[1:58:25] first loved us, there's a love that
[1:58:27] begins to pour out back to him.
[1:58:30] And that doesn't just stop at the Lord
[1:58:32] Jesus. It it overflows in your heart and
[1:58:34] it goes to your brother. It goes to your
[1:58:36] sister. It goes to your
[1:58:38] [Music]
[1:58:39] enemy. It goes to that sinner on the
[1:58:42] street that needs the love of God
[1:58:44] expressed into their
[1:58:46] [Music]
[1:58:55] life. Let's sing this song this morning.
[1:59:02] I love him.
[1:59:09] I love
[1:59:12] him
[1:59:14] because he
[1:59:17] first loved
[1:59:23] me and
[1:59:26] purchased
[1:59:28] my
[1:59:31] [Music]
[1:59:34] salvation on Cal.
[1:59:37] [Music]
[1:59:40] Calories
[1:59:44] tree. Oh,
[1:59:48] I love him.
[1:59:55] I love
[1:59:58] him
[2:00:01] because he
[2:00:03] first loved
[2:00:07] [Music]
[2:00:09] me and
[2:00:12] purchased
[2:00:14] my
[2:00:20] salvation on Christ.
[2:00:26] Calories
[2:00:28] trees. Let's just bow our heads this
[2:00:33] morning. If you notice in your heart
[2:00:35] that maybe there's a little coldness
[2:00:38] there. You don't want it to be that way.
[2:00:40] You just want the Holy Spirit to come in
[2:00:42] and and renew a love
[2:00:45] [Music]
[2:00:47] relationship. If you recognize that
[2:00:49] you've allowed a little bit of
[2:00:50] bitterness to slip in and and you're not
[2:00:53] loving your brother like you really
[2:00:55] ought to, friends, you can't manufacture
[2:00:57] it. But there's a Holy Spirit here this
[2:00:59] morning that's desiring to come into
[2:01:02] your vessel. There's a Holy Spirit
[2:01:04] that's desiring to come in a burning
[2:01:06] fire into your life and just consume you
[2:01:09] with his goodness and his
[2:01:11] grace. Heavenly Father, Lord, I ask for
[2:01:14] this congregation this morning. Lord, I
[2:01:17] don't know the life, but Father, you
[2:01:19] totally changed my message that I might
[2:01:21] express this this morning. So Lord, I
[2:01:24] pray that whoever it was for, Lord,
[2:01:25] they'd recognize it. Lord, Lord, they
[2:01:28] wouldn't pass it by, but they'd
[2:01:30] recognize that you're calling to them
[2:01:32] and you're desiring a fellowship with
[2:01:34] them, Lord. You're desiring a love
[2:01:36] relationship, Lord. Not just a cold
[2:01:38] formal church religion, but Lord, a a
[2:01:42] burning fiery love between man and God.
[2:01:45] Lord, a a bride and a groom together.
[2:01:48] Father, I'm asking that there wouldn't
[2:01:50] be one little particle of of just church
[2:01:53] tradition left in them, Lord, but they
[2:01:55] would have such a love for you, Lord,
[2:01:58] that it would just be expressed to their
[2:02:00] fellow man.
[2:02:02] Father, I pray that there'd be such a
[2:02:05] genuine love in our hearts, Lord, that
[2:02:08] we couldn't but help love our brother.
[2:02:10] Lord, not because they're deserving, but
[2:02:12] like you who said, "Father, forgive them
[2:02:15] as they nailed you to the cross." And
[2:02:18] Lord, I'm asking this morning, Lord,
[2:02:21] that our heart would would just respond
[2:02:24] in love to you, Lord. Lord, those of us,
[2:02:28] Lord, me included, that have let our our
[2:02:30] prayer life become secondary, Lord.
[2:02:33] Father, forgive me, Lord. And and let
[2:02:36] that take first place, Lord. Let my
[2:02:38] relationship with you be more important
[2:02:40] than anything else in this life, Lord.
[2:02:43] Lord, if I don't eat, then let it be.
[2:02:45] But, Father, let me have a relationship
[2:02:47] with you.
[2:02:50] Father, I just ask that our hearts would
[2:02:53] show us a an opportunity, Lord, to be a
[2:02:56] witness to those around us, Lord. Lord,
[2:02:59] not to be expressing condemnation or
[2:03:01] guilt or judgment to our fellow man, but
[2:03:04] Lord, to be expressing the love of God.
[2:03:07] Lord, to bring in souls for your kingdom
[2:03:10] by your love expressed through us. This
[2:03:13] world is dying for love. Lord, let us be
[2:03:16] a channel for that to flow through.
[2:03:20] We thank you for your grace, Lord. We
[2:03:23] thank you for your love that was
[2:03:25] expressed to us. I thank you, Father,
[2:03:27] that when I was a sinner, Lord, when
[2:03:29] there was nothing good about me, Lord,
[2:03:31] you came and you gave your life that you
[2:03:33] might redeem me. I thank you for that,
[2:03:36] Lord. And I desire just to give my life
[2:03:39] of and service back to you, Lord. Just
[2:03:42] appreciation and thanksgiving for all
[2:03:45] you have done for me.
[2:03:47] We love you, Lord. May your sweet Holy
[2:03:51] Spirit find a resting place in every
[2:03:53] heart here this
[2:03:55] morning. Grant it, Father, in Jesus
[2:03:59] Christ's
[2:04:00] name.
[2:04:04] Amen. Love of God, how rich and pure.
[2:04:08] Let's sing that this morning.
[2:04:18] The love of
[2:04:22] God is
[2:04:24] greater
[2:04:28] fall than tongue or
[2:04:32] [Music]
[2:04:35] pen can ever
[2:04:43] It goes
[2:04:48] beyond the
[2:04:51] high
[2:04:55] star and reaches
[2:05:01] to the lowest stand.
[2:05:06] [Music]
[2:05:09] The guilt sheepy
[2:05:14] hair bow down with
[2:05:19] [Music]
[2:05:21] care. God gave his

[2:06:37] reure the saints and
[2:06:44] angels

[2:06:54] [Music]
[2:06:56] within the
[2:06:58] ocean filled?
[2:07:04] And were the
[2:07:07] [Music]

[2:10:03] Where would
[2:10:07] I
[2:10:10] be? You only
[2:10:14] know. I'm glad you
[2:10:16] [Laughter]
[2:10:18] see through eyes of
[2:10:23] love. A hopeless
[2:10:27] case, an empty place.
[2:10:32] If not for grace, where would I be?
[2:10:36] Where would I
[2:10:39] be? You only
[2:10:42] [Music]
[2:10:44] know. I'm glad you
[2:10:48] see through eyes of
[2:10:52] love. A hopeless
[2:10:57] case, an empty place.
[2:11:01] If not for grace. Amazing
[2:11:04] grace. Amazing
[2:11:08] grace. How sweet the
[2:11:12] sound. I once was
[2:11:16] lost, but now I'm found.
[2:11:21] Oh, a hopeless
[2:11:25] case, an empty
[2:11:28] place, if not for grace. Amazing
[2:11:33] grace, amazing
[2:11:37] grace, how sweet the
[2:11:40] sound. I once was
[2:11:45] lost, but now I'm found.
[2:11:50] A hopeless
[2:11:53] case, an empty
[2:11:57] place if not for
[2:12:00] grace. Oh precious
[2:12:04] Lord, please take my
[2:12:08] hand. Oh, lead me
[2:12:12] on. Lord, let me stand.
[2:12:17] A hopeless
[2:12:21] case, an empty
[2:12:24] place. If not for grace, singing that
[2:12:28] again. Oh precious
[2:12:32] Lord, please take my
[2:12:36] hand. Lord, lead me
[2:12:40] on and let me
[2:12:43] stand. A hopeless
[2:12:47] case, an empty
[2:12:51] place if not for
[2:12:55] grace as they would just play softly.
[2:12:58] Did you enjoy that this
[2:13:01] morning?
[2:13:04] Amen. So thankful for the love of God.
[2:13:08] Amen. And as again as brother Zachary
[2:13:10] was there ministering, I was kind of
[2:13:14] just thinking of some of the things that
[2:13:16] I was have went through not too awful
[2:13:19] long ago. I I um I had some uh some
[2:13:26] things that I was dealing with towards
[2:13:28] somebody and and I'm just so thankful
[2:13:32] for our pastor, my father, you know,
[2:13:34] that could just lead me in the take the
[2:13:37] right steps. and you know this I was
[2:13:41] building a bitterness just just kept
[2:13:45] getting hard and my heart just kept
[2:13:48] getting hardened and and and I was
[2:13:51] needing advice. I was just I just didn't
[2:13:54] know what to do. I was just just was
[2:13:58] just going to shun him, be done with him
[2:14:00] and just tired of it.
[2:14:03] But then he would just set me
[2:14:07] down and he would tell me about the man
[2:14:11] that spat on
[2:14:14] David. And he
[2:14:17] said he spat on on David and David's
[2:14:22] guard there drew his
[2:14:25] sword and said, "How dare you spit on my
[2:14:28] king? I'm gonna slay you right
[2:14:32] now. And David said, "Hold your
[2:14:36] peace." The Lord told him to do that.
[2:14:41] The Lord told him to spit on me. And
[2:14:45] sometimes God allows things to see what
[2:14:47] we're going to do. He allows trials to
[2:14:51] come. He'll allow somebody to do a
[2:14:53] certain thing, somebody to say something
[2:14:55] about you just to see how you're going
[2:14:58] to react.
[2:15:00] And dad would set me down. And he says,
[2:15:03] "Hey, what if that person is here to
[2:15:06] build your character? What if that
[2:15:09] person is here for God to mold you to to
[2:15:12] to make you move a step higher? What if
[2:15:15] he wasn't here and and you weren't going
[2:15:18] through these things and and you would
[2:15:21] never know how to handle a situation
[2:15:23] when something else came up down the
[2:15:25] road?" And I just I had to melt down and
[2:15:28] I just said, "Lord, yeah, you know,
[2:15:31] you're right, Dad. You're right. I
[2:15:33] You're so true." And and and he would
[2:15:35] say, "Well, also what if he's causing
[2:15:39] you to do this, and maybe the Lord's
[2:15:42] allowing this person to do this so you
[2:15:44] could look up so you could say, "Lord, I
[2:15:48] I need you. Lord, I want to draw closer
[2:15:50] to you. Lord, I I I'm desperate for
[2:15:52] you." and and and you know you you never
[2:15:56] know. So instead of getting bitter,
[2:15:57] instead of allowing hatred and instead
[2:15:59] of allowing malice to come over your
[2:16:02] heart, you can say, "Lord, I want to let
[2:16:05] love prevail. Lord, I say I confess that
[2:16:08] I love you. I I tell everybody that I
[2:16:10] love you and I get behind this pullpit
[2:16:13] and I confess that I love you. I want to
[2:16:16] show a love. I I I I want to say that I
[2:16:19] love you, but I want people to know,
[2:16:21] Lord, that I do love you." and and I
[2:16:23] want to love this brother. I want to
[2:16:25] love this sister with all of my heart,
[2:16:28] no matter what they've done to me. Amen.
[2:16:31] I'm just so thankful for that message
[2:16:32] this morning, Brother Zachary. That was
[2:16:35] that was very good. Amen. But we want to
[2:16:38] let love prevail. We say we love God,
[2:16:41] but but do we love our brother? Do we
[2:16:43] love our sister? Amen. I believe that
[2:16:45] you do this morning. Amen. We want to
[2:16:48] draw closer. Oh, that is that is just my
[2:16:50] desire. That is my desire. Say, Lord, I
[2:16:54] do whatever it takes. Lord, I I just
[2:16:56] need you, Lord. I want more of you every
[2:16:59] day, Lord. I know I don't read and pray
[2:17:02] like I should, but Lord, I want you,
[2:17:04] Lord. There's a desire in my heart to
[2:17:06] say, Lord, I want more of
[2:17:09] you. Oh my. Can you give the Lord a hand
[2:17:12] clap of praise this
[2:17:14] morning? Amen.
[2:17:19] hopeless
[2:17:22] case, an empty
[2:17:26] place. If not for
[2:17:29] grace, where would I
[2:17:32] [Laughter]
[2:17:33] be? You only
[2:17:37] know. I'm glad you
[2:17:41] see through eyes of
[2:17:45] love. A hopeless
[2:17:49] case, an empty place. Thank you, Lord,
[2:17:53] for
[2:17:55] grace. Oh, amazing
[2:18:00] grace. How sweet the
[2:18:04] sound. I once was
[2:18:08] lost, but now I'm
[2:18:12] found. A hopeless
[2:18:16] case, an empty
[2:18:20] place if not for
[2:18:27] grace. Amen. Do you love the Lord this
[2:18:30] morning? Amen. Can we sing that song?
[2:18:33] You You're my brother. You're my sister.
[2:18:36] Take me by the
[2:18:39] hand. You're my brother. You're my
[2:18:44] sister. Oh, take me by the
[2:18:48] hand. Together we will work until he
[2:18:56] comes. There's no foe that can defeat
[2:19:01] us. When we're walking side by
[2:19:05] side, as long as there is love, we will
[2:19:10] stay.

[2:19:29] comes. And there's no foe that can

[2:19:43] stand one more time. Oh, you're my
[2:19:48] brother, you're my sister. Oh, take me
[2:19:52] by the
[2:19:54] hand. Together we will work until he

[2:20:02] There's no foe that can defeat us when
[2:20:07] we're walking side by
[2:20:10] side. As long as there is love, we will
[2:20:19] stand. Amen. We want to keep Brother
[2:20:23] Zachary in our prayers. Um, I failed to

[2:20:34] let's just keep them in our prayers. Um,

[2:20:44] wouldn't mind just keeping her in your
[2:20:46] prayers that the Lord would just go and
[2:20:48] touch her. Amen. Um again, brother
