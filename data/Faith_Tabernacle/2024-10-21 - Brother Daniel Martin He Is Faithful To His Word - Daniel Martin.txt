to be faithful this morning amen the musicians can be dismissed amen if you would like to turn to your Bibles this morning to uh Joshua amen dad asked me to greet the church for you this morning he um he was planning on coming home and uh the pastor there uh was really really pulling at him to uh to stay and uh he just didn't know what to do so he took a day and just uh started praying about it and the pastor uh had told um Dad that U brother Anthony brother Christian's dad was his right-hand man and um they was just all devastated over the loss there of it being all of a sudden so Dad felt led to stay behind but um he wished he could be here this morning so um if you want to just keep him in your prayers uh this morning but Joshua um ver uh chapter 1 his brother Branson announced the financial report there is in the back and we will only be having one service today um so um and also the Fall Festival is uh November 3rd so we want to keep that in our our hearts this morning um the sign up sheet I believe is still in the back for those that are still wanting to sign up for that so let's keep that in our prayers also um uh Sister Crystal is putting together a um a life for celebration of life for sister py um November 9th um but she's asking that you would RSVP by October 25th um just everyone getting together and um sharing thoughts of U sister py there over food and things like that so let's uh remember that in our prayers as well amen uh Joshua the first chapter and the first verse it says now after the death of Moses the servant of the Lord it came to pass that the Lord spake unto Joshua the son of nun Moses Minister saying Moses my servant is dead now therefore arise go over this Jordan that thou and all this people unto the land which I G do give to them even to the children of Israel and every place that th that the soul of your feet shall tread upon that have I given unto you as I said unto Moses amen if we could turn also to Matthew uh chapter 24 amen let's keep in mind that the Lord spoke unto Joshua jhua and he gave him a promise as he did unto Moses in chapter 20 or Matthew 24 just a single verse here chapter 24 verse 35 it says in Heaven and Earth shall pass away but my words shall not pass away amen can we just bow our hearts for a moment now dear heavenly father Lord Lord we just count it an honor and a privilege Lord to Lord to be here and Minister your word father and Lord we feel your presence here this morning already Lord and Lord we ask that you would just come down lord and just continue to move in just a in a special way this morning Father Lord I pray Lord that whatever may be said today Lord that Lord that your people would just find Comfort Lord and and and knowing that your word is always faithful Lord father Lord we just ask that you would have your way this morning we ask it all in your name Jesus Christ we pray amen amen you can be seated amen we uh I'll um I'll have brother Josiah put this flyer there in the back um so y'all can um see it there um but if I um uh if I were to give a title this morning I would like to um maybe uh title it he is faithful to his word amen so we seen that um God gave Moses or Joshua a promise for them to go and possess the promise and um so God keeps his word he's got to keep his word amen in order to be God Amen in order to be God he has to stand behind everything he said in his word amen and that's exactly where our faith should rest this morning is is upon the spoken word of God Amen do you believe that so if we look back when the children of Israel were in bondage and and and in Egypt and God promised them a deliverer God sent his word and he promised a deliverer now God uh made a covenant with Moses that he would lead them he made a promise with Moses that he would Le them and take them to the land flowing with milk and honey amen and no matter how long it took God was faithful to his word and was able to perform exactly what he had promised amen and and no matter how long it took no matter what he did or had to do to get the job done he he had to call the Flies down he had to create the frogs he had to turn water into the blood and he had to allow death to come in but he was faithful to his word and after they had uh done seen the glory of God down in in Egypt and how God kept his word of of delivering out of Egypt with signs and wonders they had seen the signs and wonders of what God had done and when they seen the the pressing time come and when they when the Red Sea had cut them off the desert had had cut them off and Pharaoh's Army was just behind them and and brother Brown says oh what an hour but God seems to take pleasure in getting his children in such a position it's strange how God leads his children amen as a poet used to say some through the waters some through the flood some through deep trials but all through the blood God has a way of leading his children so odd and pec uh peculiar uh amen do you believe that but God's uh path happened to lead through the Red Sea amen and if God provides a way he or if God has a provided way he has to make a way amen if you come to a Red Sea in your life it's up to God to part that Red Sea it's up to God to make a way amen and and how beautiful to notice just in that crucial hour God waits to the very God always waits to that very crucial moment but he can speak and things Heap up according to his word amen he had promised uh them to take them to the promised land and he's obligated to keep his word amen that great dark crucial moment how easy it was God to figure it out amen when they come up to the Red Sea and they were confused they didn't know what to do they seen that what God did for them in Egypt and now they come up to another trial and and they just become confused and they were asking Moses why would God lead us here but it was brother brand says it was so easy for God to make a way amen and God didn't get all confused he he had the whole situation under control amen he just took the pillar of fire and he moved it over in between the Egyptians coming and it was light to Israel and it was dark to the Egyptians oh the Red Sea got scared and just walled itself up because God's path LED through the middle of it that's the way God does things amen God loves to prove himself to his people amen sometimes as humans we we don't understand why we go through things and we don't understand why we why certain things happen to us and and why God does certain things and and sometimes we we just want to get confused and and sometimes we just want to ask God why but we must remember who holds tomorrow in his hands amen he promised you will see brighter days and he's obligated to keep his word Amen brother brandom says because these people was keeping his word and walking in the light and moving on following God's Commandments everything just opened up for them and if you want things to open up for you you take God out his word and start moving forward walk in the light of his word as he is in the light amen walk in the light for he is the light amen now we understand that they came to the place called Kadesh Baria and that was the Judgment seat for the testing time for or for a testing time for all of Israel and God always test his children by his word amen and did you uh did you hear that God test his children by his word if you believe his word God test you by the word amen now if you notice they come a time to go over and spy out the land amen they they sent out spies and and they sent out 12 Spies and when they went over to spy out the land they came back the 12 and 10 of them said we can't take it we just can't take it they're they're they're much bigger than we are and the cities are walled and we look like grasshoppers beside those great Giants and it just looks impossible amen how many times have we come to a situation it looks impossible for us amen the giants look too big the walls look too big the walls look too strong and and we just don't know what to do but Caleb and Joshua they had uh they had another uh promise they they held on to amen numbers 13:30 says and Caleb stealed the people before Moses and said let us go up at once and possess it for we are more than able to overcome it amen Caleb and Joshua were looking at one thing and the 10 was looking at something else oh my the 10 was looking at circumstances the 10 was looking at things that was impossible and and the 10 was just looking at their own ideas and how they seen things but Caleb and Joshua was looking at one thing and that was God's word amen you got to look at God's word this morning amen I don't know how it's going to be done amen if we could just look past those circumstances this morning and focus on what God's word says it'll be okay amen I don't know how it's going to be done but God said that he would have a church without a spot without wrinkle without blemish and I believe he's going to have it oh my he's going to have it just believe it amen it's not up to us to know how God is going to do with the world is getting darker and darker and it just looks bleak and Bleak but as long as there's light amen Darkness can't Prevail amen just believe in and he will do it amen he'll do whatever it takes amen he'll part the waters if he has to amen just know that he is faithful to his word amen he is obligated to keep his word this morning he said I will never leave thee nor forsake thee that's a promise to hold on to Oh my he has proven his word over and over again and it's never failed not one time amen his word has withstood the test of time for over 2,000 years he's proven his word over and over again and never once has it returned void amen he was faithful to Moses he was faithful to Abraham he was faithful to Noah he was faithful to Paul and Martin he was faithful to Luther and Wesley he was faithful to William brandom and he is faithful still today to you his bride amen he will be faithful over his word concerning you amen it's Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever amen God is true to his promise no matter what he has to do amen he will Bank bankrupt Heaven before he will let his word go defeated oh my amen that's a promise to hold on to he will bankrupt Heaven just to meet your need whatever he has to do he's going to meet your need this morning amen he won't let his word go defeated amen he never made a promise that he can't keep I am the Lord that heals all thy diseases and if they lay hands on the sick they shall recover if thou can't believe all things are possible to them that believe amen that's the God we serve this morning amen this world is uh amen we got to rest upon the spoken word this morning amen amen they they didn't know what to do the cities were just too high the walls were just too high but don't look at your circumstance this morning focus on what God says amen the world is trying to find a God in an Easter Bunny they're trying to find God in in rituals and they're trying to find God in Santa Claus and they're trying to find God in their Creeds and their Traditions amen they're trying to introduce the people to a god through rituals and good works and it's only blinding the people from the true word of God Amen but let me say this this message came and int introduced us to Jesus Christ amen amen my God doesn't need an introduction this morning we all know who Jesus Christ is this morning we've all experienced his power amen but I serve a God who Reigns Victorious this morning a God who has never lost a battle amen a God that has done the impossible Time After Time amen he has now he has had the power he has the power to break every chain he has the power to to set the captive free this morning amen he has the power to men the broken heart amen I serve a God who always was and forever will be amen he will never leave me nor forsake me though I walk through the valley of shadow of death I will fear no evil why because he's faithful to his word oh my that's the God we serve this morning amen and I believe there's a people here this morning that know him and that recognize who he is and people this morning that know they God Amen they've tested him they've tried him and found that he will be faithful to the end amen you got to put God to the test amen and you will always find he is faithful to his word amen I've never seen the righteous forsaken or a seed a begging for bread here this morning amen amen do you believe he's here this morning he's in our midst this morning ready to meet your every needl amen people put them off as a god of History they put them off as a God that once was and and other people are crying out where is the god that on the Red Sea where's the god that walked on the water where's the god that that that that that raised that little girl from the dead where's the god that spoke through a man and said little fishy I give you back your life they are looking for a god this morning but we know he is here in our midst performing through his people amen where is he today he is here he is here the world can't see it but God has an elected little group group here in Blacksburg Virginia who has recognized that Jesus Christ made flesh again in these last days performing signs and wonders amen that's right now remember God gave them the land down in Egypt and said the land is yours every bit of it is yours wherever The Souls of your feet tread upon I've given it to you now you just got to go get it oh my now the people today are expecting God to reach down and get them by the neck and say you bring me out clean me up heal me and I'll believe you God doesn't do his business that way he gives you the promise but you have to go fight for every inch of ground that you possess why didn't God go over there and just run the run out all the amorites and the Hittites and the perizzites all of them why didn't he just run them out no Israel had to do something Israel had something to do and you've got something to do God said that land is yours go possess it amen they had to fight for every inch of it every inch of the way they had to go fight for it but they had that assurance that it would be given to them no matter what the results were or no matter what the circumstances looked like it belonged to them oh my God gave it to them and they looked at the promise instead of the circumstance amise Lord amen healing is yours salvation is yours this morning you don't have to wait till tomorrow you don't have to wait till years from now it's yours today just possess it amen the holy spirit is yours Peter said on the day of Pentecost repent every one of you and be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost for the promises unto you and to your children and to them that are far off as many as the Lord Our God shall call The Promise is just as real today as was then and it's your pro it's your possession it's your promise if you'll just go take it it's given to you amen if God calls you he intends for you to have it but you'll have to fight every inch of it to get it amen sometimes we got a lot of lazy Christians today we don't want to fight for nothing but God if you're going to want promises if you want if you want to see things happen in your life you got to possess it oh my don't give in to the lies of the devil amen now now there remained among the children of Israel seven tribes which had not received their inheritance man and Joshua said unto them children of Israel how long are you slack to go possess the land which the Lord your God of your fathers hath given you amen we could say that that same thing today you've been on that mountain long enough it's time you get up and you go possess that land amen you've come out of Egypt he's brought you this far now it's time you go possess your promise amen his path will lead you through the fire his path will lead you through the flood through hard times through through sickening times through bad times but he's promised that you would come out on the other side why because he's faithful to perform all that he has promised you amen just as God gave Israel a pillar of fire of cloud by day and a pillar of cloud Pillar of Fire by night to lead them to the promised land so has he in in this day giving us a confirmation that his word Still Remains the Same today amen that cloud appeared there on Sunset Mountain there and he had his picture taken with the prophet through the form of a pillar of fire amen my God is still the same yesterday today and forever amen this message is getting us ready to meet him in the air amen it's getting us ready for that new land that that land flowing with milk and honey this morning amen we have that assurance that if God made the promise he will be faithful to fulfill his promise amen Jesus said Heaven and Earth will pass away but my words will never fail amen I would rather be standing on his word this morning than Heaven I'd rather be standing on his word this morning than Earth because it will pass away but his word will remain true amen you've been sitting on this mountain for too long you've been sitting on that pain for too too long come on now you've been sitting on that depression for too long oh you've been sitting on that heartbreak for too long it's time you possess that mountain amen It's Time For That Mountain to come down it's time for that depression to come down it's time for that heartbreak to come down oh my it's time for your complexes to come down you've been fighting them too long it's time you do something about it oh Hallelujah Jesus said I will be with you even in you till the end of the world Amen God has given you the power and the authority to overcome amen he didn't just put you in this world and says you you just have to do it on your own but now he knew you would need his power and his authority to overcome the devil amen it would be easy for us for God just to wave the little wand and watch our troubles disappear amen just watch our watch our uh lives just become a fairy tale it would just be so easy for God to do that amen but that's our God's provided way amen you've been given the same Authority as Christ has our our pastor has been preaching on the same Authority as Christ and he is trying to tell you that you have that authority to defeat the Devil oh my get off that mountain oh my he's called you out of Egypt it's time you move forward don't be
