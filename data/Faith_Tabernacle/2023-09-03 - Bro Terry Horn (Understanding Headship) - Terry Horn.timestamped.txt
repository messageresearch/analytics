[34:56] well praise the Lord good to be in the
[34:59] house of the Lord this morning
[35:01] beautiful beautiful as we call Sunday
[35:04] morning the Lord's day and we're
[35:06] thankful Lord to be Christians in this
[35:09] day
[35:11] so we are going to have good morning
[35:13] class
[35:15] as you always sees me so I'm teases me
[35:18] saying I'm going to have my pencil and
[35:19] paper because I'm going to be ready for
[35:20] class when you teach so
[35:23] um
[35:24] a lot of times when a musician can be
[35:26] dismissed if somebody bring me a Hanks
[35:28] if I actually forgot mine a lot of times
[35:31] when you
[35:33] you we preach and you you teach we we
[35:35] spend a lot of time on foundation so I'm
[35:39] going to kind of uh bypass a lot of
[35:42] Foundation get right into the message so
[35:45] if I if I'm short this morning
[35:48] so be it
[35:51] that's what my wife said but amen
[35:56] all right
[35:58] so but uh but I just said if
[36:02] if I if so yeah if all right so let's um
[36:08] before while we're turning to First
[36:10] Corinthians 11 I want to read a short
[36:13] quote that brother ever said he said but
[36:15] it never
[36:16] it has never been at any age God's
[36:19] intention for his people to act like the
[36:21] people of the world or to be governed or
[36:24] controlled like the people of the world
[36:26] God's people is always been a peculiar
[36:30] people a different people called out a
[36:34] separated and all together different in
[36:37] their actions in their ways in their
[36:40] manner of living
[36:41] that's what the peoples then the peoples
[36:44] of the world has their appetized for
[36:47] things that all their makeup is is
[36:49] always contrary to the things of the
[36:52] people of the world and their desires it
[36:55] started with Israel Israel as always to
[36:57] be separated a called out a separate
[36:59] nation not reckoned with the Nations
[37:00] Israel was to be different act different
[37:03] dress different observe different
[37:05] artists gods and they were God's chosen
[37:08] and you know with the Israel course is
[37:10] the type of the bride and we are to be
[37:12] the same way we're separated people a
[37:14] royal priesthood a chosen Nation so
[37:17] uh let's turn to First Corinthians 11
[37:19] and I have a a message this morning now
[37:21] brother Sean asked me about two months
[37:24] so I've had a long time repair so I've
[37:26] prepared about three sermons
[37:29] so my biggest struggle in the last week
[37:31] was now which one to go with which
[37:33] direction to go and I ask everybody to
[37:35] to listen to Christ the mystery which
[37:37] brother Sean's been talking about
[37:39] headship and we've been talking a lot
[37:40] about headship and such a wonderful
[37:42] subject and we're going to talk about
[37:43] some of that but we're going to talk
[37:45] about a particular thing this morning
[37:47] and actually I've I priest around it but
[37:51] I've never never really took it and
[37:52] actually broke it down in detail and
[37:54] explained it and we're going to do that
[37:56] this morning in First Corinthians 11
[37:58] let's just start
[38:00] 11 1.
[38:04] Paul says be ye followers of me
[38:07] even as I also am of Christ
[38:13] follow me now as
[38:16] as I follow Christ Now Praise You
[38:19] Brethren that you remember me in all
[38:20] things to keep the ordinances as I
[38:22] delivered unto you
[38:24] now verse 3
[38:26] but I would have you to know that the
[38:28] head of every man is Christ and the head
[38:30] of the woman is the man and the head of
[38:33] Christ is God
[38:36] now if we stop right there we got all
[38:39] the text we need for uh preaching on a
[38:42] headship but never aspect of headship
[38:45] but now what would happen if we read the
[38:47] next verse
[38:49] verse 4.
[38:51] every man now he's talking about man
[38:53] praying or prophesying having his head
[38:57] covered he's talking about his own part
[38:58] of his body his Cranium his head
[39:01] Dishonored his head which is Christ we
[39:03] just said in verse three his head is
[39:05] Christ now in verse 5 now what if we
[39:08] read verse 5. but every woman now the
[39:12] woman now that prayeth or prophesied
[39:14] with her head her physical head her
[39:17] Cranium uncovered
[39:19] Dishonored her head and we found out her
[39:22] head is her husband
[39:25] for even that is all one as if she were
[39:29] shaving now we're talking about hair
[39:33] so now wait a minute in verse 1 Paul
[39:36] says follow me I'm your leader and then
[39:38] as I follow Christ he's my head he's my
[39:41] leader now verse 3 we find out the head
[39:44] of the woman is the man and then verse 5
[39:47] he's something he's talking about hair
[39:52] so now wait a minute now somebody just
[39:55] what in the world
[39:57] his hair got to do with headship
[40:04] how many would like to know the answer
[40:07] amen well I'm going to do it I'm going
[40:10] to we only got about four or five hands
[40:11] but that's not majority but we're going
[40:13] to do it anyway
[40:16] uh you you'll enjoy it's very very good
[40:18] very good let's pray Lord Jesus thank
[40:21] you for the reading of the word thank
[40:22] you Lord for the the letter that Paul
[40:25] wrote to the Corinthians thank you for
[40:26] the correction and Lord most of all
[40:28] thank you for the understanding thank
[40:30] you that you sent your message during
[40:32] this day that we might have
[40:33] understanding and his brother Sean is
[40:36] doing such a good job on the services of
[40:38] prayer uh pray with understanding and
[40:40] then last week praying in truth it must
[40:42] be revealed truth we're thankful for
[40:45] those things and Lord I pray that you
[40:46] would speak to our hearts we've already
[40:48] invited your presence and help us Lord
[40:50] that we might understand a little deeper
[40:52] into this subject and why we ask your
[40:55] help Lord in the name of Jesus Christ
[40:57] and everybody says
[40:59] amen
[41:01] now I want to talk about you could be
[41:03] seated we want to talk about
[41:04] understanding headship and I like to
[41:07] give it kind of a that's kind of the
[41:09] general thought that we want to go but I
[41:12] want to be more specific and talk about
[41:14] understanding the Veil
[41:18] so I'm just going to go jump right into
[41:20] the middle okay
[41:22] uh Marco I want to go to Genesis 2 right
[41:25] now Genesis 2 18 a couple of scriptures
[41:28] in Genesis
[41:29] Genesis 2 18
[41:32] let's look at the order of headship
[41:33] between husband and wife
[41:35] now one thing if let me just kind of
[41:38] preface this if you ask uh obviously
[41:41] we're going to talk about why a woman
[41:43] shouldn't cut her hair
[41:44] I know that you none of you do that and
[41:46] hopefully none of you ever trim it but
[41:48] here's the thing I want you to
[41:50] understand why if I ask a denominational
[41:52] person of course first of all they don't
[41:54] even believe it's wrong to cut their
[41:55] hair but if they did believe it why it's
[41:58] it's you it's you should not cut your
[42:00] hair she said well the Bible says so
[42:02] that's true but why
[42:04] you know there's got to be a reason why
[42:06] you know and it's
[42:08] so we want and another thing even for
[42:11] our sisters uh to teach your children
[42:14] teach if you've got daughters teacher or
[42:16] daughters you know why you know you
[42:18] should have long hair and this will
[42:20] really help all of us and this also has
[42:22] to do with headship
[42:25] uh Genesis 2 18 and the Lord God said it
[42:28] is not good that man should be alone I
[42:32] will make a help meet for him
[42:34] now first notice it's not recorded that
[42:37] Adam ever complained about being alone
[42:39] uh because you know Adam had God but
[42:42] it's interesting what brother Brown said
[42:44] about this statement but God said it's
[42:47] not good so God certainly had a reason
[42:49] to make a help meet for Adam and brother
[42:53] Brown says now and question answers he
[42:55] said now there went the male and female
[42:57] in the cow and there went the horse and
[42:58] there went the ox and there went
[43:00] everything in pairs see there was but
[43:03] there was something lacking that crave
[43:05] showed that there was a mate waiting for
[43:08] him you get it and the Very thoughts
[43:10] that we have to die here that we're
[43:12] troubled and perplexed here we long for
[43:15] a life that has no death it shows we're
[43:17] waiting for so there's a thirst there's
[43:19] a craving there and he said and Adam was
[43:22] lonesome and God to show that they could
[43:25] not be separated to show that they
[43:27] cannot be separated after he made Eve
[43:29] now I'm going to go back and do the same
[43:31] thing just a second look he never went
[43:33] and got dirt and made Eve notice where
[43:36] Eve came from
[43:38] but he made from the original dirt Adam
[43:42] a rib which you know understand he took
[43:45] a rib from his side and made him a help
[43:47] me and that was Eve she was made for the
[43:51] man and part of the man she was part of
[43:54] him in the beginning in the creation in
[43:56] the theophany she was part of him down
[43:59] here in this creation she could not be
[44:02] divided in any other creations she had
[44:05] to be made of the same creation talking
[44:07] about the original dirt atoms made from
[44:09] what he was created from
[44:11] and brother I said that's exactly why
[44:13] Christ and God had to be the very same
[44:15] person it could not be anything
[44:16] different couldn't be divided Christ and
[44:19] God are one
[44:20] now and let's look at verse 20 Genesis 2
[44:24] and 20.
[44:25] and Adam gave names to the cattle into
[44:29] the fowl of the air and to every beast
[44:30] of the field but for Adam there was not
[44:33] a help me for him
[44:36] now in verse 17 God tells Adam not to
[44:38] eat of the tree of the knowledge of Good
[44:39] and Evil and that was before Eve was was
[44:41] actually formed but it's not recorded
[44:45] that Adam actually that God told Eve not
[44:48] that but you know whether he told him or
[44:50] Adam I actually relayed the message
[44:51] doesn't matter she knew that she was not
[44:54] to partake of that tree that fruit now
[44:57] in verse 20 but for Adam there was not
[44:59] found to help me for him now what is a
[45:02] help me
[45:03] we call it a help mate the Bible calls
[45:05] it'll help me what is a help me it's
[45:07] interesting what the definition helped
[45:09] me is what what a real help me is
[45:12] help me it means don't miss it help me
[45:15] means a helper suitable for him
[45:19] a counterpart of himself
[45:22] a helper cards corresponding to him
[45:26] now I'm going to go through the thing if
[45:27] y'all want to you know take notes that's
[45:29] fine with me a helper correspond to him
[45:31] now a helper corresponding
[45:34] a helper corresponding now that term is
[45:37] not a demeaning term remember now before
[45:40] the fall before the fall and this is
[45:42] really interesting because before the
[45:43] fall Eve was co-equal with Adam before
[45:46] the fall
[45:49] they had this they had the same nature
[45:51] now remember only the flesh was a
[45:53] byproduct from Adam her spirit came from
[45:56] Adam uh Adam had both the Mastin and a
[46:00] feminist Spirit uh that before Eve was
[46:03] ever formed so her spirit came from from
[46:05] Adam because he had both those spirits
[46:07] but her flesh of course was the
[46:09] byproduct so here we have a very
[46:12] interesting observation before the fall
[46:14] there was no need for headship because
[46:16] they were both equal right
[46:19] right that's true right she was
[46:21] co-equaled with Adam but now after the
[46:24] fall that changed everything
[46:27] changed everything
[46:28] now in verse 23
[46:32] and Genesis 2 23 and Adam said this is
[46:35] now remember God had put Adam to a deep
[46:37] sleep took a rib from his side closed up
[46:41] the gash and he wakes up now and Adam
[46:43] said this is now bone of my bone flesh
[46:46] in my flesh she shall be called woman
[46:49] because she was taken out of man God
[46:52] obviously had to give him a revelation
[46:54] because he was in a deep sleep when this
[46:56] surgery took place but he says now she's
[46:59] boning my bones because now as we said
[47:01] Adam took one of God took one of them
[47:03] Adam's Rib which is bone now he's bone
[47:05] rebound flesh of his flesh she should be
[47:08] called woman because she was taken out
[47:11] of man now she shall be called woman
[47:14] what does the word woman mean
[47:17] very interesting I had a brother I had a
[47:20] brother one time said I can tell you how
[47:22] you spell woman now we spell it
[47:24] w-o-m-a-n but he said because he didn't
[47:27] have a very good marriage but he said
[47:28] the way I spell won't but
[47:31] w-o-e-m-a-n woman
[47:34] but what does what does the woman mean
[47:37] actually woman means the word the root
[47:41] word of because well man the root word
[47:43] is man
[47:44] so that's a clue right there Whoa man
[47:47] woman the Hebrew word is m-a-n-n-i-n
[47:51] which is rendered a female man
[47:55] remember his Spirit came from Adam he
[47:57] had both Baptist and feminists
[48:00] took a rib made a byproduct form flesh
[48:02] so actually in short term actually a
[48:06] woman actually they say the word woman
[48:08] actually is short for the word womb man
[48:11] w-o-m-b womb man she carries the so she
[48:14] can have receive seed and have a child
[48:16] so that's where that come from now of
[48:18] course in Genesis 3 Genesis 3 Here Comes
[48:22] Satan in the picture and of course he
[48:24] defiles everything and we know Satan
[48:26] uses a serpent to communicate with he
[48:28] with Eve now in Genesis 3 2 and I'm I'm
[48:32] just hurting along so we don't want to
[48:35] take a lot of time Genesis 3 2 now and
[48:38] the woman said it to the serpent now
[48:40] here's the serpent speaking uh the woman
[48:44] speaking back to the serpent the woman
[48:46] said to the serpent we may eat of the
[48:48] fruit of the Trees of the garden now Eve
[48:50] knew not to partake of it
[48:53] we may eat at the fruit of the Trees of
[48:55] the garden verse 3 but the fruit of the
[48:57] tree which is in the midst of the garden
[48:58] God has said ye shall not eat of it
[49:01] neither shall you touch it lest ye die
[49:03] and the serpent said unto woman ye shall
[49:06] not surely die but she did die
[49:10] so first of all we know that was a lie
[49:12] to begin with that was Lie number one
[49:16] it's very very interesting and then
[49:20] for in verse Genesis 3 and 5.
[49:24] for God does not now suffer speaking
[49:27] here now again in serpent as a woman you
[49:29] should not surely die for God does know
[49:32] that in the day that ye thereof then
[49:36] your eyes shall be open and ye shall be
[49:39] as Gods knowing Good and Evil
[49:42] now according to brother random that's
[49:44] lie number two
[49:46] I'm going to read you the quote I didn't
[49:48] know this until just a few months back
[49:52] now if you read Genesis 3 22 this is
[49:55] where the serpent got that from remember
[49:56] he always tries to quote the scripture
[49:58] but he'll take the scripture and he'll
[50:00] misplace it misconstrue it or misapply
[50:03] it Genesis 3 22 and the Lord God said
[50:07] behold the man the behold the man has
[50:10] become one of us to know good and evil
[50:12] and now lest he put forth his hand and
[50:15] take also of the tree of life and eat
[50:17] and live forever live forever
[50:20] now listen what brother Madam says about
[50:22] this scripture
[50:24] brother man said in Revelations chapter
[50:26] 4 said let's turn to Genesis 3 24 just
[50:28] for a minute Genesis the third chapter
[50:30] 24 verse you love it Congress amen now
[50:32] let's begin about 22nd verse uh this is
[50:36] something I just want to put in here
[50:37] just a little extra but it may do a
[50:39] whole lot it may do a whole lot of good
[50:42] someday
[50:44] yeah I believe it did now this is what
[50:46] brother remember says and the Lord said
[50:49] and the Lord said behold the man has
[50:52] become one of us
[50:55] and he stops now my loving and precious
[50:58] darling sisters let me place it like
[50:59] that do not think that I am throwing a
[51:02] reflect upon the loyalty and the
[51:04] gracious precious Jewel of Womanhood I'm
[51:06] trying to show here that a woman dot dot
[51:08] dot please and you on tape you women are
[51:11] listening to this tape I'm not trying to
[51:12] scorn you I'm only a servant of the Lord
[51:15] to bring light he and of course he talks
[51:17] about this in marriage and divorce the
[51:18] lowest in the lowest and most immoralist
[51:21] and most filthy thing on earth is a
[51:23] woman when she is bad
[51:25] and the most precious Jewel that there
[51:28] is to a man besides his salvation is a
[51:30] good woman
[51:32] right
[51:34] and I'm speaking to that he's talking
[51:37] about speaking of that low immoral
[51:39] degraded now I'm going to show you right
[51:41] here while we're at it just might as
[51:43] well show you why that I the Bible
[51:46] teaches for a woman not to be preachers
[51:47] pastors teachers or anything else in the
[51:49] church now listen to this then he goes
[51:51] back to that scripture and the Lord said
[51:53] behold the man has become one of us
[51:56] and brother man says now he never said
[51:59] that
[52:00] the woman has become one of us the man
[52:04] has become one of us and knows good and
[52:07] evil the man says she the woman didn't
[52:10] she was deceived do you see it
[52:14] she was deceived so Satan is telling her
[52:17] you're going to know good and evil and
[52:19] you're and you're going to be as God
[52:20] you're going to know the difference so
[52:21] far but that was a lie because
[52:23] God already knew that the woman was
[52:25] going to be deceived because he made her
[52:27] thus he made her that she could be
[52:29] deceived like Paul talks about the for
[52:33] Adam was first
[52:35] conceived you know and I forget how the
[52:37] scripture goes but Adam was not in the
[52:40] transgression but Eve being deceived was
[52:42] in the transgression she was the one
[52:44] that's being deceived she didn't think
[52:45] she was wrong but she was actually
[52:46] deceived
[52:49] and so she and Paul said I suffer not a
[52:53] woman to teach or a serpent Authority
[52:54] that's continued on the same quote but
[52:56] for Adam was first form and Eve and Adam
[52:59] was not deceived but the woman was
[53:01] deceived so she didn't become one of God
[53:04] she didn't know no different she was
[53:07] deceived do you get it I guess she says
[53:09] amen and the Lord said behold the man
[53:11] has become one of us to know good and
[53:13] evil and to know and now lest he put
[53:15] forth his hand and take also of the tree
[53:17] of life and live forever it's really
[53:19] interesting you take that scripture I
[53:21] don't have the quote in front of me but
[53:22] brother man just said the same thing if
[53:23] you take that that scripture said that
[53:26] and Earth is groaning waiting for the
[53:28] manifestations of the sons of God
[53:30] brother man said the same thing so you
[53:31] notice he never said about the women
[53:33] it's all it's always about the sons of
[53:36] God because see laodicea and laodice
[53:39] said everything in laodicea is backwards
[53:42] and perverted backwards and perverted I
[53:45] mean anything that I that I am going to
[53:47] say today none of laodicea believes it
[53:50] they don't want it they would hear it
[53:51] they'd throw me out on my ear because
[53:53] they don't because this is people's
[53:55] rights women's rights laodicea Satan's
[53:58] Eden Satan's Paradise they don't want
[54:00] anything to do with the rightful divided
[54:03] word we understand that that's it's so
[54:06] sad but it's still the truth see so you
[54:09] can't teach this like I said to the
[54:10] Pentecostal Church you know uh because
[54:12] people's rights and women's rights and
[54:14] women's equality and actually today it's
[54:16] it's women's superiority
[54:18] uh
[54:21] uh you you could thank God we don't have
[54:24] television but even for last 20 25 years
[54:27] uh I have heard and I heard saw a lot of
[54:30] years ago we had every commercial the
[54:33] man's a dummy and the woman's the smart
[54:34] one it's all the way through I mean it's
[54:36] just all the way through in the last 15
[54:39] 20 30 years it's just got worse and
[54:41] worse I don't care what they're
[54:42] advertising the woman's the smart one
[54:45] the man's a dummy
[54:46] it's all for a purpose because this is
[54:49] Satan's Paradise Satan's eaten this is
[54:51] Satan's kingdom and God's going to have
[54:54] a perfect bride out of Satan's Paradise
[54:56] A Perfect Bride she don't this Perfect
[54:59] Bride doesn't doesn't believe the lies
[55:01] of Satan none of it so in God's Eden Eve
[55:06] was co-equal with Adam then after the
[55:08] fall she lost her co-equanus so here is
[55:11] a here's the result
[55:13] in Genesis 3 16 here's the result unto
[55:16] the woman he said I will greatly
[55:18] multiply thy sorrow and thy conception
[55:21] and saw Thou shalt bring four children
[55:23] and their desire and thy desire shall be
[55:26] to thy husband and he shall rule over
[55:29] thee I didn't write it I'm just reading
[55:32] it
[55:34] now
[55:36] see what Eve did she throws the whole
[55:38] world into death
[55:40] she so she Eve she lost her
[55:43] co-equiveness and in Genesis 3 16 is
[55:46] where the headship began for the woman
[55:49] she she didn't need headship before the
[55:52] fall so now ever since the fall God
[55:54] required headship for both men and women
[55:58] now I want to kind of deviate just a
[56:02] little bit and I want to talk just a
[56:03] little bit about false history false
[56:05] headship just for uh just for a couple
[56:08] of minutes to show why God had said
[56:11] Malachi 4.
[56:13] and even after the fall God remained
[56:15] ahead over all things at least that's
[56:17] what was God is was intent one his
[56:19] desire but mankind of course failed and
[56:22] always they just failed and failed
[56:25] miserably and and because they couldn't
[56:27] fully obey that you see now and Satan
[56:30] Satan because of the fall and he was
[56:33] able to interject death into the human
[56:35] race Satan wanted to be the head over
[56:37] the world the Nations and all so we find
[56:40] Satan desire in Isaiah 14. we won't read
[56:42] it but you read that he said I will I'll
[56:44] be exalted above the stars of heaven and
[56:47] I'll be like the most high and I will I
[56:49] will I will
[56:51] so Satan had his headship all the way
[56:54] down from the beginning until finally
[56:56] for finally in this day in this day
[56:58] Isaiah 14 is fully matured manifested
[57:02] and accomplished eyes uh Satan it become
[57:06] the god of this world
[57:08] this is his paradise his kingdom his
[57:11] world he has the Nations he has
[57:13] everything
[57:14] amen Satan is a God of this evil age but
[57:17] he comes on down his his headship came
[57:19] down with Nimrod because that was
[57:21] Satan's headship at one time that made
[57:24] everybody pay tribute to head to uh
[57:26] Nimrod and then it came down to pergamus
[57:28] Satan's seat for a while and then
[57:30] Babylon and comes on down to the
[57:32] Pharisees and then the Catholic church
[57:34] and made the Catholic Church of Pope
[57:36] over all of it which still is the
[57:38] headship of all denominations of
[57:40] Catholic church and Through the Dark
[57:42] Ages they killed 68 million Christians
[57:44] during that time and as I said the
[57:47] Catholic church is still the head over
[57:48] every Church denominational system
[57:50] Independence all of them
[57:52] and finally down to the end Satan will
[57:55] be the head his has become the headship
[57:57] of all Nations but now it's not babbling
[58:00] like it was in the beginning but now
[58:02] it's mystery Babylon Revelation 17 not
[58:05] just Babylon but his headship now is
[58:07] Mystery babbling of course sits on Seven
[58:09] Hills room and we know that Catholic
[58:11] Church
[58:12] now
[58:13] and how many worships Satan this is one
[58:17] good reason that we so thankful for
[58:19] Malachi for how many are worshiping
[58:22] Satan so well I don't know anybody where
[58:24] to say worship Satan really
[58:27] brother man said Thank you in the worst
[58:29] been god brother man said and God of
[58:30] this evil age now listen
[58:33] for Satan is not spoke of as a god of
[58:36] any other age but this age he wasn't
[58:39] spoke of the god of the age of Noah he
[58:41] wasn't spoke of the god of the age of
[58:43] Moses the god of the age of Elijah but
[58:46] this evil age oh don't miss it he is a
[58:50] God of this evil age worshiped by
[58:53] millions and billions of people and they
[58:56] don't know it
[58:58] [Music]
[58:59] that is so so sad
[59:04] what was the rebuke to laodicea wretched
[59:06] miserable blind and don't even know it
[59:10] worshiped by millions and billions of
[59:13] people they don't know it but their
[59:15] worshiping him through a Creed a
[59:17] man-made denomination increase that's
[59:18] brought the people right down to the
[59:21] greatest deception the world has ever
[59:22] known of
[59:25] thank God he sent Malachi 4.
[59:28] amen that's why in this last evil age
[59:31] God had to send Malachi for he had to
[59:33] send Malachi he said if I don't I'll
[59:35] even Smite the Earth with a curse if it
[59:37] had become so corrupt in the mind of God
[59:39] he had to send Malachi 4 to straighten
[59:41] this mess out and get a people ready for
[59:44] the Rapture there had to be something
[59:47] come and bring us out of the of the
[59:50] filthiness of spiritual wickedness in
[59:53] high places and denominations to get a
[59:55] bride ready for a rapture
[59:59] I mean thank God he sent us a prophet
[1:00:01] Messenger to forerun the coming headship
[1:00:04] that's why Revelations 10 1 Christ The
[1:00:07] Covenant Angel he has come down he is
[1:00:09] here he is our head he is our headship
[1:00:12] as even in 1933 on the Ohio River that
[1:00:16] was that famous quote as John the
[1:00:17] Baptist will sit the forerun the first
[1:00:19] coming of the Lord you'll have a message
[1:00:21] that will forerun the first the second
[1:00:22] coming of the Lord there had to be a
[1:00:24] forerunner to forerun the coming word
[1:00:27] we're thankful that he sent us a message
[1:00:29] or the forerun the coming word and we
[1:00:33] realize that first Thessalonians 4 16 to
[1:00:36] shout the voice and the trumpet so forth
[1:00:37] you know and uh our ship our headship is
[1:00:40] there and I had a whole another whole
[1:00:42] message on that brother man talks about
[1:00:44] and I had you listen to Christ the
[1:00:45] mystery you know the headship in the
[1:00:47] body has become one unit and all about
[1:00:49] that that's that's not something to be
[1:00:51] taken lightly that is actually a uh a
[1:00:54] paradox because it's not even true in
[1:00:57] the denomination because their headship
[1:00:58] is not the word to reveal word present
[1:01:01] day truth but it is for the bride
[1:01:04] now I had a I had a a DVD I wanted to
[1:01:07] show you a clip was only about five
[1:01:09] minutes but the new computer doesn't
[1:01:11] have a a DVD uh a tray in it so I can't
[1:01:15] I can't play that but what it actually
[1:01:18] it really what it actually showed was
[1:01:20] and actually taught was probably the
[1:01:23] best expose that I've ever heard of what
[1:01:26] is real salvation I mean true salvation
[1:01:29] your dedication to the Lord your your he
[1:01:32] is he is the control of your life
[1:01:33] everything you do you say you you think
[1:01:36] your passions uh uh it's it's not so
[1:01:38] much that Christ died to uh crucified
[1:01:41] you know to keep us uh out of hell but
[1:01:44] that God could that that God could come
[1:01:47] out of heaven and be actually put into
[1:01:49] mankind what God always desired from the
[1:01:52] beginning God above us God With Us now
[1:01:54] God innocent God wanted to indwell in
[1:01:56] human beings and finally after six
[1:01:59] thousand years he's finally has
[1:02:00] accomplished that with the headship and
[1:02:02] the body has become one unit never has
[1:02:05] been that way in the fullness like we
[1:02:07] see it today never has they had partial
[1:02:09] word in Luther partial Wesley partial
[1:02:12] Pentecost but never the the full word
[1:02:14] born into manifestation where the
[1:02:17] Prophet God could say she's bone on my
[1:02:19] bone flesh of the flesh Life Is Life
[1:02:21] pirate fire she is him
[1:02:24] absolutely she is him
[1:02:27] and her headship is Christ
[1:02:30] all together
[1:02:32] that's why in the token message a
[1:02:34] Monumental statement brother man says
[1:02:36] full obedience to every word of God what
[1:02:40] entitles you to the Token what is a
[1:02:43] token the token is a literal life of
[1:02:46] Jesus Christ that life his life is now
[1:02:49] manifested in you
[1:02:53] amen now listen only and only in this
[1:02:56] age could a prophet give the answer to
[1:02:59] the devil's question
[1:03:00] and we have the answer to the devil's
[1:03:03] question now I brought I want to bring
[1:03:05] all that out in this other sermon what
[1:03:07] is the answer to the devil's question
[1:03:08] the headship is here the head Christ
[1:03:12] the headship Christ our head and the
[1:03:14] body has become one unit just beautiful
[1:03:18] amen not only is is he here he is the
[1:03:21] headship of the body and has become one
[1:03:23] unit as I said I just want to read this
[1:03:25] quote out of classroom Ministry and then
[1:03:27] we'll go on to more specific brother man
[1:03:30] says now now notice the anointed man the
[1:03:33] Christ himself here oh God is made known
[1:03:36] but now look but now why he has the
[1:03:40] preeminists god fully manifested in
[1:03:43] Jesus Christ God's Great secret of his
[1:03:46] Revelation now the threefold purpose you
[1:03:48] know to reveal God have Primitives in
[1:03:50] his bride and restore the kingdom never
[1:03:52] was as I said before it never was ever
[1:03:54] that God had complete preeminence in his
[1:03:58] bride they had part word even from
[1:04:00] Pentecost as much as they knew but they
[1:04:03] didn't have the full word only in his
[1:04:05] age beautiful
[1:04:07] he said but God's Great secret see this
[1:04:11] God had him back part of his mind this
[1:04:14] great secret that he never even revealed
[1:04:16] until the prophet of this age come
[1:04:19] Christ is the mystery of God revealed as
[1:04:22] I told you before every time you read
[1:04:24] mystery in the Bible the word at the
[1:04:27] original Greek it's word secret Christ
[1:04:29] is the secret of God revealed it's
[1:04:31] always secret King James just says
[1:04:33] mystery but it means the same thing but
[1:04:35] Christ is the secret of God revealed the
[1:04:37] devil don't even know that
[1:04:40] now when I read this quote I thought
[1:04:42] thank you Lord thank you Lord that great
[1:04:45] light of Revelation is always blinded
[1:04:47] the wisdom of the world in the days of
[1:04:49] Jesus Christ when he was here on Earth
[1:04:50] they had blinded them too said why you
[1:04:54] even make yourself God you make yourself
[1:04:55] equal with God he was not only equal
[1:04:58] with God he was God himself see and they
[1:05:01] don't get it
[1:05:04] God don't tell his secrets to the devil
[1:05:09] listen but he goes on to say in this
[1:05:11] short quote God's Great secret has
[1:05:15] always blinded the wisdom of the world
[1:05:17] they can't get it they just don't
[1:05:19] understand and he says and Satan don't
[1:05:22] understand it either
[1:05:24] if Satan understood that Jesus Christ
[1:05:27] was a messiah why would Satan kill Jesus
[1:05:30] Christ to redeem all mankind he said you
[1:05:33] may you're a man making yourself God he
[1:05:36] didn't believe that Jesus was God he
[1:05:38] didn't believe he was a messiah he
[1:05:39] didn't believe he's a redeemer Satan he
[1:05:42] did not understand that at Calvary had
[1:05:45] he understood he would have never he'd
[1:05:47] had Band-Aids all over him
[1:05:50] no no he didn't understand Satan did not
[1:05:53] understand that the prophet God said
[1:05:55] that Satan don't even understand and he
[1:05:57] don't understand it yet today that
[1:05:59] Christ and his bride can have complete
[1:06:01] Unity together he don't understand that
[1:06:04] today
[1:06:07] none of the rest of them I understand
[1:06:08] none of the rest of them understands it
[1:06:10] but just those who are predestinated to
[1:06:13] understand it how that God and Christ
[1:06:15] are one and how the Christ and the bride
[1:06:18] are one
[1:06:19] oh praise the Lord now I'm going to read
[1:06:23] let's get into First Corinthians 11 and
[1:06:28] I wanted some time to do that but I'm
[1:06:30] not going to do it today but I'm just
[1:06:31] going to cover some really really
[1:06:33] interesting background of why
[1:06:36] Paul wrote the letter of First
[1:06:39] Corinthians
[1:06:40] and he brought in about women cutting
[1:06:43] their hair and you're going to see some
[1:06:45] very interesting wonderful things but
[1:06:47] I'm going to read Verses 4 through 16
[1:06:50] out of the emphatic dialogue I got in
[1:06:52] front of me you don't have but you can
[1:06:53] follow if you will follow in your Bibles
[1:06:55] it's almost word for word but in the
[1:06:57] dialogue now let me just say about the
[1:06:58] dialogue the dog lot is not a version
[1:07:01] like the King James version We believe I
[1:07:04] have a king we all go by the King James
[1:07:05] we believe it it's it's perfect but
[1:07:08] there are certain words in there that
[1:07:10] are not rendered exactly in the Greek
[1:07:12] but the dog law is exactly the Greek
[1:07:15] word by word just just print it out just
[1:07:18] like the Apostle spoke it just like
[1:07:21] Jesus said and actually the dialogue is
[1:07:23] is actually clearer so that's the reason
[1:07:25] and brother man said brother man said
[1:07:27] ever clergyman ought to have a copy of
[1:07:29] the dialogue and read out of the
[1:07:31] diaglock called the emphatic diaglock
[1:07:33] let's read in verse four starting four
[1:07:36] and I'm just going to read this quickly
[1:07:37] I'd like to I could take each one of
[1:07:38] these verses and break it down it's a
[1:07:40] beautiful beautiful understanding of
[1:07:42] headship but we'll just touch on a
[1:07:44] couple of things in a minute verse 4 11
[1:07:46] 4 every man praying or prophesying
[1:07:49] having his head covered disgraces his
[1:07:52] head now it's just a little bit
[1:07:53] different word exact same meaning verse
[1:07:56] five but every woman praying or
[1:07:58] prophesying with her head uncovered
[1:08:00] disgraces her head for it is just the
[1:08:04] same as if it were shaven
[1:08:07] verse 6 for if a woman be unveiled
[1:08:12] let her hair also be cut off or shaven
[1:08:15] now I mean that's crystal clear I mean
[1:08:18] any denominational person could read in
[1:08:20] diaglock could see right there for if a
[1:08:22] woman be unveiled let her hair also be
[1:08:24] cut off or shaven but if it be
[1:08:27] disgraceful to a woman to have her hair
[1:08:30] cut off or to be shaven let her be
[1:08:33] veiled
[1:08:34] that's pretty clear to me if you go if
[1:08:38] you go in back to Deuteronomy a place in
[1:08:40] the Old Testament we're actually the uh
[1:08:43] the the law under the Jewish law about
[1:08:46] the uh a woman who thinks he's who
[1:08:50] actually her husband thinks he has
[1:08:52] cheated
[1:08:53] dishonorable like that if she's found to
[1:08:56] be like that they actually shave her
[1:08:57] head and it's a disgrace to her and
[1:08:59] she's a public you know prostitute and
[1:09:01] so forth like that so it actually has a
[1:09:03] Jewish background that's why he refers
[1:09:05] back to it you know just if you're gonna
[1:09:07] cut it at all then just shave it off be
[1:09:09] slick because that's a disgrace to a
[1:09:11] woman to have her head being shaved
[1:09:13] that's the reason he put that in there
[1:09:14] verse seven now amen indeed ought not to
[1:09:17] cover
[1:09:18] the head he being God's glorious
[1:09:21] likeness but the woman is man's Glory
[1:09:24] see the difference
[1:09:26] man's head is is Christ the woman's head
[1:09:29] is a man
[1:09:30] for a man is not from woman but woman
[1:09:33] from man for man also was not created
[1:09:37] for the woman but woman for the man you
[1:09:40] can't tell that to laodicea I mean
[1:09:42] brother man talks about obey they took
[1:09:44] that out of the scripture and a woman
[1:09:45] obeyed today no she obeys him that's
[1:09:48] what the prophet of God said but the
[1:09:50] woman was made for the man Eve was made
[1:09:52] for Adam
[1:09:54] Adam was not made for evil is made for
[1:09:57] Adam
[1:09:59] and he says therefore because and he
[1:10:01] said now the woman was made for the man
[1:10:03] therefore or as a result of the woman
[1:10:06] ought to have Authority or power on the
[1:10:09] head on account of the angels and
[1:10:11] brothers said well as far as the Angels
[1:10:13] their messenger said every Prophet God
[1:10:14] would just blast out about women cutting
[1:10:16] her hair a lot in that but we we won't
[1:10:18] take time for that however neither is a
[1:10:20] woman without the man or The Man Without
[1:10:21] The Woman in the work in the Lord for as
[1:10:24] the woman is from the man so also the
[1:10:26] man is by the woman but all things are
[1:10:29] from God we're going to touch on that in
[1:10:30] just a minute judge yourselves it is is
[1:10:34] it becoming for a woman to pray to God
[1:10:36] unveiled we know what unveiled is he's
[1:10:39] removed recovery to remove your covering
[1:10:41] you cut your hair so is it a is it
[1:10:44] becoming for a woman to pray to God with
[1:10:46] cut hair unveiled does not even nature
[1:10:49] herself teach you that if a man indeed
[1:10:51] should have wear long hair it is a
[1:10:54] disgrace to him but if a woman should
[1:10:57] wear long hair it is a glory to her
[1:10:59] because now here's the most interesting
[1:11:01] part of this whole verse you've got to
[1:11:02] understand how it's actually house verse
[1:11:05] 15 actually written into King James
[1:11:09] uh but if a woman have long hair it's a
[1:11:11] glory to her for her hair is given her
[1:11:13] for a covering and the dialogue it says
[1:11:16] verse 15 but if a woman should wear long
[1:11:18] hair it is a glory to her because her
[1:11:21] hair has been given to her instead of a
[1:11:24] veil
[1:11:26] her hair is given to her instead of a
[1:11:28] veil
[1:11:30] now
[1:11:32] that's why my sub topic subject is
[1:11:35] understanding the Veil
[1:11:38] let's learn a little bit about why Paul
[1:11:40] wrote this to the Corinthians now
[1:11:46] Paul wrote 14 books of the Bible we know
[1:11:48] that in his letter he wrote to the ones
[1:11:50] to Colossians thessalonica and Ephesus
[1:11:52] and so forth there were letters for
[1:11:53] edification encouragement and correction
[1:11:55] and to straighten out a lot of false
[1:11:57] teaching like for example in first
[1:11:59] Thessalonians the first Thessalonians
[1:12:01] Paul writes about the day of the Lord
[1:12:03] and so what happened was they come into
[1:12:05] a lot of judaizers and false teachers
[1:12:07] and they began to propagate the idea
[1:12:09] that the day of the Lord that uh you
[1:12:11] know the day of the Lord is upon us
[1:12:13] right now and so what happened was that
[1:12:16] uh seeds of false Doctrine come in and
[1:12:19] many overreacted by they gave up their
[1:12:21] job they became idle they began to live
[1:12:24] off of others and assuming that the the
[1:12:26] coming of the Lord is so imminent and
[1:12:27] they just become Idol and then that got
[1:12:29] them into other problems because they
[1:12:31] misinterpreted the scripture then Paul
[1:12:33] comes around about several months later
[1:12:35] and and and and writes a letter in
[1:12:37] second Thessalonians and he's and he
[1:12:39] straightens out that false Doctrine and
[1:12:41] said before they come to the Lord
[1:12:43] there's got to be a falling away first
[1:12:44] and he explains the man of sin has got
[1:12:47] to come on the scene before there's a
[1:12:48] falling it's got to be a fallen away
[1:12:49] before the the coming of the Lord so he
[1:12:52] has to straighten out that issue that
[1:12:54] cropped up in the church at thessalonica
[1:12:56] same thing with the in the Corinthian
[1:12:58] Church there was the issue there were
[1:13:00] some issues in that church you think we
[1:13:02] got issues in the church today you say
[1:13:04] well there's early church they didn't
[1:13:05] have no problem they had problems
[1:13:07] they had problems
[1:13:09] and one of the reasons they had problems
[1:13:11] because they were Gentile most of them
[1:13:13] were Gentile converts in colossae and
[1:13:15] thessful knocking these places like that
[1:13:16] they were not Jews they were Gentile
[1:13:18] Converse they know nothing about the
[1:13:20] Jewish law very little about the Jewish
[1:13:22] law so to tell that you know you've got
[1:13:24] to do this don't do that or whatever
[1:13:25] they they didn't understand that I mean
[1:13:27] they all they knew was idolatry and
[1:13:29] fornication and illicit sex and and you
[1:13:31] name it they had they had brothels and
[1:13:33] all kinds of stuff in idolatry worship
[1:13:38] so Paul had to straighten this issue out
[1:13:41] if he needed if he strained it out then
[1:13:43] he really needs to straighten it out
[1:13:44] today doesn't he
[1:13:46] so he he did now you must understand the
[1:13:49] early church they had some serious
[1:13:50] problem now the church at Corinth it had
[1:13:52] some problems too
[1:13:55] like for example in First Corinthians
[1:13:57] First Corinthians 5 1 just reading the
[1:13:59] Scripture it is reported commonly that
[1:14:02] there is fornication among you and such
[1:14:04] fornication has not so much as named
[1:14:06] among the Gentiles that one should have
[1:14:08] his father's wife now Paul said look
[1:14:10] it's reported that this thing is this is
[1:14:12] taking place in the Corinthian Church so
[1:14:15] he had to address that they had some
[1:14:17] problems
[1:14:20] for most Christians they were Gentile
[1:14:22] like I said that they knew very little
[1:14:24] about the law of Moses and Paul in the
[1:14:27] Crimson church he had to feed them a lot
[1:14:28] on milk a lot of Correction so now the
[1:14:31] church at Corinth it had another issue
[1:14:33] and this is the issue that's kind of
[1:14:35] plagued all the way down and this is a
[1:14:37] good example of mislo or misinterpreting
[1:14:40] a scripture
[1:14:42] uh
[1:14:43] Paul needed to straighten out the
[1:14:45] headship issue there
[1:14:47] and this has ship issues were called
[1:14:49] about a scripture they were going to
[1:14:50] read and this scripture is Galatians 3
[1:14:54] 26 27 28 I want you to bring that up
[1:14:56] Galatians 3
[1:14:58] 26 27 28. and this actually was
[1:15:02] the scripture that calls most of the
[1:15:05] confusion back at that early church and
[1:15:09] still today
[1:15:10] Galatians 3 26 for you all for all of
[1:15:15] the children of God by faith in Christ
[1:15:16] Jesus 27 for as many as of you as have
[1:15:20] been baptized into Christ have put on
[1:15:22] Christ here it is verse 28 there is
[1:15:25] neither Jew nor Greek there is neither
[1:15:27] Bond of free there is neither male nor
[1:15:29] female for you are all one in Christ
[1:15:33] Jesus is that the scripture
[1:15:35] how do you rightly divide that scripture
[1:15:42] listen it see it seemed some seem to
[1:15:46] think a couple of things that brother
[1:15:47] Brahm calls confusion saying he says now
[1:15:50] this this scripture here along with
[1:15:52] Paul's teaching about headship one that
[1:15:55] the man is the head of the woman that
[1:15:56] caused a lot of confusion in the early
[1:15:59] Corinthian Church now one place Paul
[1:16:03] said the head of the woman is a man and
[1:16:05] another place he says there's no there's
[1:16:07] neither male nor female in Christ so
[1:16:09] what the result was
[1:16:11] the women began to claim that they could
[1:16:13] do just what the men could do this early
[1:16:16] Corinthian Church the women between
[1:16:18] begin to think that they could do what
[1:16:19] the men could do because Paul said this
[1:16:21] neither male nor female in Christ Jesus
[1:16:25] they could preach they could teach they
[1:16:27] could appear in public unveiled
[1:16:30] women begin to pray women actually begin
[1:16:33] to pray in the public which was unveiled
[1:16:35] which was absolute disgrace
[1:16:37] for a woman to be in public unveiled
[1:16:41] actually cloth Veil over a head I think
[1:16:44] the Arabs still you know they steal the
[1:16:45] burqa whatever it is they still bail
[1:16:47] themselves which was an insult to both
[1:16:50] the Jews and the Gentiles for a woman to
[1:16:52] pray in public unveiled it was a
[1:16:54] universal custom for women to always
[1:16:56] appear in public with their head covered
[1:16:58] or her veil her veil was her veil was a
[1:17:02] token sign of in public of her loyalty
[1:17:05] to her husband as her headship it was a
[1:17:09] sign that was her token sign in public
[1:17:11] if she was out in public she she must
[1:17:13] wear that Bell showing that her loyalty
[1:17:15] is to her husband and she was not a
[1:17:18] public woman
[1:17:21] if she took the veil off in public she
[1:17:23] was considered to be a public person and
[1:17:26] not a loyal wife at home privately
[1:17:28] actually the absence of the veil was a
[1:17:31] stamp of harlotry
[1:17:34] actually it was a stamp when she wore
[1:17:36] when she was unveiled took the veil off
[1:17:38] in public it was a stamp of harlotry
[1:17:41] pretty serious isn't it very serious
[1:17:45] it was the man's place to serve in
[1:17:47] public it was a wife's place to serve at
[1:17:50] home
[1:17:51] now along with that scripture uh we know
[1:17:56] he whom the son of man has made free is
[1:17:58] free indeed it also it gave the women a
[1:18:01] license for women to begin to think they
[1:18:03] could do whatever men could do
[1:18:05] I mean we could we could preach a
[1:18:07] message on freedom you know when he whom
[1:18:09] the son of man is set free is free
[1:18:10] indeed listen freedom and I'm not going
[1:18:13] to preach on this Freedom will finally
[1:18:14] Destroy This Nation
[1:18:16] freedom
[1:18:17] because if you don't have controlled
[1:18:19] people that's got at least some common
[1:18:22] sense and some Authority for for the
[1:18:25] authority and some understanding of
[1:18:28] headship right and wrong and so forth
[1:18:29] Freedom will just take you Plumb down to
[1:18:32] the gutter which is on that way down
[1:18:35] and besides that what was the
[1:18:38] you remember what the three sins I think
[1:18:40] there's five sins of Sodom but there's
[1:18:41] three of the five three three is at
[1:18:43] least the three sins of Sodom is
[1:18:45] certainly in America in full force today
[1:18:47] Pride fullness of bread idle time
[1:18:52] sends us autumn that's right idle time
[1:18:54] fullness of bread Pride hello America
[1:18:58] history tells us that it seems that the
[1:19:00] Corinthian slogan was everything is
[1:19:03] permissible for the women and the
[1:19:06] Corinthian women expressed that
[1:19:08] principle by throwing off their Veil
[1:19:11] also they seem to reject the concept of
[1:19:14] subordination
[1:19:16] the husband being their head
[1:19:18] uh subordination according to Paul for a
[1:19:21] woman to throw off her veil was a was
[1:19:23] degrading to her as she might as well
[1:19:26] shave her head which was a sign of
[1:19:28] disgrace if you're going to take your
[1:19:29] Veil off just shave your head slick
[1:19:31] which was disgraceful in the Old
[1:19:33] Testament according to Jewish law anyway
[1:19:35] so
[1:19:37] hold on everybody I got a purpose for
[1:19:39] all this now remember a misinterpreted
[1:19:41] scripture neither male or female
[1:19:44] calls this confusion now I'm going to
[1:19:46] read you a short paragraph taken from
[1:19:48] history and this is what kind of a
[1:19:50] overview of what it was back then in the
[1:19:53] Corinthian Church
[1:19:54] and I quote here it began to Dawn on
[1:19:57] women that she was neither man's toy nor
[1:20:01] slave but that she had a life to frame
[1:20:04] for herself she was not dependent upon
[1:20:08] man for her Christian privileges
[1:20:10] ought she not to show this by laying
[1:20:12] inside the veil which was an
[1:20:15] acknowledged Badge of dependence
[1:20:19] so she said well sure you know since
[1:20:21] there's neither male or female I mean I
[1:20:23] could just throw off my veil I can be
[1:20:24] like man I can do what the man can do
[1:20:26] and we can preach we can do this we can
[1:20:28] do that
[1:20:29] not so according to the scripture we
[1:20:32] understand that now
[1:20:34] First Corinthians 11 15 but if a woman
[1:20:37] have long hair is the glory to her for
[1:20:39] her hair here's a here's the whole Crux
[1:20:42] of the whole thing her covering her veil
[1:20:45] they had to have a cloth Veil back then
[1:20:47] they had to wear a veil in public
[1:20:49] anytime that they went out in the public
[1:20:51] the woman must be veiled otherwise she
[1:20:54] was tagged
[1:20:57] but now Paul in the New Testament and
[1:21:00] under grace not under the law under
[1:21:01] grace it says it's a glory to her for
[1:21:04] her hair is given to her for a covering
[1:21:07] her hair has been given to her instead
[1:21:10] of a veil so God now has declared now
[1:21:13] you women you don't have to wear a cloth
[1:21:15] Veil anymore your hair is your Veil
[1:21:20] that's your Veil and that's why the
[1:21:23] prophet God told us when she cuts her
[1:21:24] hair she takes her veil off she
[1:21:27] disgraces her head which the husband
[1:21:29] she's she is the glory of the husband
[1:21:31] she disgraces her husband that's why I
[1:21:33] brought them and we'll get to that in
[1:21:34] just a minute how many times
[1:21:37] how many times did brother Ben talk
[1:21:39] about Bob's hair cut hair women won't
[1:21:42] let your hair grow long cut your hair
[1:21:44] off whatever all this almost 400 times
[1:21:48] brother man talks about that how
[1:21:50] important that was not just because well
[1:21:53] they shorten the hair it's a sign it
[1:21:55] says it's it's a it's a symbol it's a
[1:21:58] meaning behind it God declared that that
[1:22:01] be a sign and she hold true to that sign
[1:22:06] as I said reading from the Greek but if
[1:22:09] a woman should wear long hair it is a
[1:22:11] glory to her because her hair has been
[1:22:13] given to her instead of the Veil
[1:22:16] her hair is given instead of a veil now
[1:22:19] we have a little better understanding of
[1:22:21] why the prophet hammered so much against
[1:22:24] women with bobbed hair or cut hair short
[1:22:27] hair cut their hair off or any other
[1:22:29] phrase like I said almost 400 times I
[1:22:32] mean why it's it's it's not to be hard
[1:22:34] on women but but it's to save them from
[1:22:37] a disgraceful life in a disgraceful
[1:22:39] destiny so this it's it's God appointed
[1:22:42] declaration
[1:22:47] now let me show you something here
[1:22:50] you say well it's it's it's not the it's
[1:22:53] not the physical hair follicle
[1:22:57] that is is a sin but it's the that he
[1:22:59] could which you can't do it not for me
[1:23:01] to do it but it's it's a sign look let
[1:23:04] me show you something in the Old
[1:23:05] Testament God had a covenant with Israel
[1:23:07] and that Covenant with circumcision now
[1:23:09] the physical circumcision was not the
[1:23:12] Covenant itself but it was a sign of the
[1:23:14] Covenant it was required but the
[1:23:16] circumcision was a sign of the Covenant
[1:23:18] God made a covenant with the Jewish
[1:23:21] people with the Jews of Israel and that
[1:23:23] was circumcision but that was the actual
[1:23:26] uh physical thing was a sign of that
[1:23:29] Covenant that God made with Israel just
[1:23:31] like water baptism I mean does water
[1:23:34] save a person water don't save you but
[1:23:37] you but now the Church of Christ
[1:23:38] believed that it does because I I was
[1:23:40] researching right because the Bible says
[1:23:42] even does water now save you not to put
[1:23:44] away the filth of the flesh but the
[1:23:45] answer of a good conscience called God
[1:23:47] but we have water baptism what is water
[1:23:49] baptism water baptism is a requirement
[1:23:52] but it's a sign it's it's an outward
[1:23:54] sign of an inward work that's what but
[1:23:57] you must be baptized now we know the
[1:23:59] thief on the cross he didn't have
[1:24:00] opportunity to be baptized he was saved
[1:24:02] also but is it is an outward sign of an
[1:24:06] inward work
[1:24:07] I mean you could talk about a wedding
[1:24:10] band you could talk about a lot of
[1:24:11] things that are actually signed for the
[1:24:13] minutes of the woman should wear a
[1:24:14] wedding band to show that she is married
[1:24:16] you know and then we you know they
[1:24:18] exchange wedding bands you know they
[1:24:20] come but the Covenant brother man said
[1:24:21] marriage divorce when the man asked the
[1:24:23] woman then that their their in God's eye
[1:24:26] they're legally married right there so
[1:24:27] to speak you know because they made that
[1:24:29] Covenant they made the agreement
[1:24:31] but the wedding band is a sign of it and
[1:24:33] it's the same thing with the veil her
[1:24:36] hair has been given to her instead of a
[1:24:38] covering but it's a sign that she's
[1:24:40] under subjection and headship of her
[1:24:42] husband now you tell that to a layout
[1:24:45] sin woman
[1:24:46] wife and I was talking about this the
[1:24:47] other day if you take just and brother
[1:24:49] Graham said in in future home he said I
[1:24:52] can guarantee you one thing there will
[1:24:53] be no bobbed-haired women in that City
[1:24:56] quote unquote
[1:24:58] now if you just now we know the Rapture
[1:25:01] is the brightest for the bride they go
[1:25:02] to the wedding supper they're in the
[1:25:04] Millennium with Christ you know we don't
[1:25:06] have to go the white Throne we live in
[1:25:07] the new city the other people live on
[1:25:10] the outside of the city but let me ask
[1:25:11] you if if in laodicea today if cutting
[1:25:15] your hair was the was just the only
[1:25:17] criteria that keep a woman out of the
[1:25:20] Rapture how many women in La Odyssey
[1:25:22] would go
[1:25:24] how many you know as well as the very
[1:25:27] very very few
[1:25:31] then if you take the Deuteronomy 22 4
[1:25:33] woman putting on a garment pertaining to
[1:25:34] a man if you had if that was the only
[1:25:36] criteria how many it would go into
[1:25:38] Rapture very very very few
[1:25:43] that's why that's why I read that that
[1:25:46] quote at the very beginning where
[1:25:48] brother Memphis said God's intention for
[1:25:51] his people in any age it's never been in
[1:25:53] any age God's intention for his people
[1:25:55] to act like the people of the world
[1:25:57] never she's always been a separate
[1:26:00] people look different act different talk
[1:26:03] different dress different everything's
[1:26:05] different their action their ways that
[1:26:07] men are living everything their
[1:26:08] appetizers thing and all that they're
[1:26:10] making everything in this world is
[1:26:12] contrary that's why she is to be
[1:26:15] different
[1:26:17] oh my and
[1:26:19] now the veil I said the veil is not the
[1:26:22] headship it is a sign and a public
[1:26:24] Declaration of her loyal to her headship
[1:26:26] which are which is her husband and the
[1:26:30] Bible says in the New Testament that God
[1:26:32] declared a woman's hair to be instead of
[1:26:34] the veil that's why her hair is her veil
[1:26:37] and that's why if she cuts her hair at
[1:26:39] all she's removing that Veil
[1:26:44] scissors are not for women period at all
[1:26:48] none zero
[1:26:50] and train up your children I mean people
[1:26:53] I listen I I you know they asked brother
[1:26:56] Ben a question about you know trimming
[1:26:58] uh Rebeccas and Sarah's hair and stuff
[1:26:59] like that I said well I you know I can't
[1:27:01] say maybe if she's four or five years
[1:27:03] old you know be okay to trim her bangs
[1:27:05] or whatever like that he said I know you
[1:27:06] talk the Bible's talking about women but
[1:27:09] the Bible does say train up your
[1:27:10] children the way they should go
[1:27:13] so we just leave that there
[1:27:16] so there you are there you are that's
[1:27:18] the reamer Theresa com women are
[1:27:20] commanded not to cut their hair trim it
[1:27:22] burn it or do anything to the length of
[1:27:25] the hair leave it alone that's your
[1:27:26] that's not only is your glory that is
[1:27:29] your Covenant
[1:27:30] that you are submissive to your husband
[1:27:32] your head that's why brother man said
[1:27:34] it's just a common common thing for a
[1:27:37] woman if she cuts her hair even to pray
[1:27:39] and in fact in fact they can't receive
[1:27:42] this God I mean if a woman's got cut
[1:27:45] here God will hear a prayer of
[1:27:47] repentance
[1:27:48] he will hear a prayer to repentance but
[1:27:51] just just a general prayer that's why
[1:27:52] brother man said that so many times just
[1:27:54] a common old thing for a woman to pray
[1:27:56] with her haircut because God don't hear
[1:27:57] a prayer I mean uh he said but it's just
[1:28:00] that's just the way it is I mean it's a
[1:28:02] that's that that's why this bride is
[1:28:04] different
[1:28:05] she's not like the world
[1:28:07] just all together now
[1:28:10] I got here
[1:28:13] a beautiful little quote just for you
[1:28:15] sisters
[1:28:18] just for you sisters and I'm actually
[1:28:20] I'm finished
[1:28:21] I'm closing
[1:28:23] and Al said don't you never say you're
[1:28:25] closing unless you're closing
[1:28:29] but I told you I was just going to get
[1:28:31] right to the point leave it just to tell
[1:28:33] you why just a video okay now listen
[1:28:35] sisters I know I know that Satan has
[1:28:38] been said marriage divorce you know that
[1:28:40] uh he has chose the woman and he's her
[1:28:43] designer and and uh the beauty of women
[1:28:46] in the last days and on and on and on
[1:28:48] and boy he targets the women I mean she
[1:28:51] is the Bull's Eye she is targeted in
[1:28:53] this day we know that
[1:28:55] but I found this and I held on to it and
[1:28:58] I want you you sisters you can rejoice
[1:29:01] in this
[1:29:02] okay
[1:29:04] I shall read
[1:29:08] she was not in the original creation
[1:29:11] all other females in the original
[1:29:12] creation bird male and female animals
[1:29:15] male and female but in human life God
[1:29:18] only made a man and he took from him and
[1:29:22] a woman is a byproduct of a man because
[1:29:24] God did not Institute such a thing
[1:29:26] search the scriptures exactly right God
[1:29:28] no sir in his original creation she was
[1:29:32] put out there but
[1:29:36] you want me to read the rest of it now
[1:29:39] would you would you save it for next
[1:29:40] time I preach
[1:29:41] no
[1:29:42] you want me to read it how many more
[1:29:44] wants me to read it
[1:29:46] it's not human unanimous how many wants
[1:29:48] me to read it everybody okay
[1:29:51] all right sister
[1:29:53] no sir in his original creation but she
[1:29:56] was put out there but
[1:29:59] this is choosing of a bride
[1:30:01] 1965. but if she can hold herself right
[1:30:06] what a greater reward she has than the
[1:30:10] man
[1:30:12] wow yeah well Hallelujah
[1:30:17] it's amazing
[1:30:19] I didn't write it I just read it
[1:30:24] I shall read it again
[1:30:27] but if she can hold herself right you're
[1:30:31] targeted God knows you're targeting this
[1:30:33] day
[1:30:34] if she can hold herself right what a
[1:30:37] greater reward she has than man
[1:30:42] she's put on a testing ground
[1:30:44] through her come death she's guilty of
[1:30:48] all death but then God turned right
[1:30:50] around and used one thing to bring life
[1:30:53] back again brought his son through the
[1:30:55] woman and obedient one
[1:31:01] musicians would you call
[1:31:05] but if she can hold herself right what a
[1:31:08] greater reward she has than man
[1:31:14] to me that was worth the whole sermon
[1:31:20] praise the Lord
[1:31:22] amen I told you I wasn't going to hold
[1:31:25] you long today but I was going to get
[1:31:27] right to the point
[1:31:30] I said I know you sister don't cut your
[1:31:32] hair teach your children why why teach
[1:31:35] them why especially you got daughters
[1:31:37] why it's not just the way the Bible said
[1:31:40] don't cut it but why it's a sign of your
[1:31:43] subjection and headship to your husband
[1:31:47] uh let me just read that it was just a
[1:31:49] little footnote
[1:31:52] and I wanted to read out here out of the
[1:31:54] indigo
[1:32:02] which I've already said it but it's just
[1:32:04] real short
[1:32:08] it said
[1:32:12] the word uh Ray did which they're
[1:32:15] talking about she shall have power over
[1:32:16] head is the word raid Edge signifies a
[1:32:20] veil the Apostle used the word
[1:32:23] excrucia authority to none of it to
[1:32:26] denote Avail because the Hebrew women
[1:32:29] Veil themselves in presence of men in
[1:32:32] token of their being under their power
[1:32:34] or authority
[1:32:36] their subjection to their head
[1:32:40] their husband
[1:32:42] s aren't you aren't you so glad that God
[1:32:44] restored proper headship in this day I
[1:32:47] mean for the for for the husbands I mean
[1:32:48] our headship is Christ I mean we we have
[1:32:53] we're we're targeted but the women are
[1:32:56] targeted because
[1:32:57] he never said like you know the Bible
[1:32:59] does talk about it if a man look on a
[1:33:02] woman to lust ever you know it's a he's
[1:33:04] already committed adultery with her he
[1:33:05] never said that about a woman because
[1:33:06] it's it's just it's it's not a
[1:33:09] necessarily a reversible thing which we
[1:33:11] have bad women that lust and so people
[1:33:13] like that but because the woman she she
[1:33:15] has that vessel she is that vessel and
[1:33:18] so it's just it's just the way the
[1:33:20] creation went
[1:33:22] so she's got to hold herself she's got
[1:33:24] her dress right she can't expose herself
[1:33:26] she can't give any indication she's
[1:33:28] she's not even supposed to be to be
[1:33:30] flirty and all these things like that
[1:33:31] she's supposed to hold herself right
[1:33:33] [Music]
[1:33:35] because she's not a public woman
[1:33:37] she's a private woman she gives herself
[1:33:40] and brother man said very simply women
[1:33:42] you serve God by serving your husband
[1:33:44] it's very simple
[1:33:46] you serve God by serving your husband
[1:33:49] amen where is he at sing us a song
