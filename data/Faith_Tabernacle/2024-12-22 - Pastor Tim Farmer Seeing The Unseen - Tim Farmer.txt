you have your Bibles uh with you if you'll turn with me to the Book of Exodus chapter 33 and we do sure appreciate you today church and all that you do you and the blessing that you've been to me and your pastor we sure appreciate brother Shawn and having confidence in us today to come and speak to you and uh we sure do appreciate his ministry and this uh his uh Ministry has been a great blessing to my heart also and all these men uh brother Amy here brother Terry brother Daniel brother Josiah all the ministers and just been just been blessing to him man and uh you know getting a little on up the road now you know I ain't a younger no more and uh you know I I need someone to help me and uh I see that my wife tells me all the time said you need to get someone to help you and I'm kind of one of those that's done everything myself and it's kind of hard and it's hard to it's it's hard to so you you you pray that you cuz that's very hard you say well brother Tim what is it why is it hard it's hard because they can't do it the way you can do it that's what you think that's what it really comes down to but and so you you pray for me and that's that's part of getting out of the way ain't it that's God help us uh but you do you need you need help and uh we all do and uh and and it's good to have a Helping Hands some was and uh so so we than so uh just thinking to day he asked us to come and brother Brenham said uh you had to use old SP terar sometimes and uh good SP ter of course when brother Bram was here he was upset because they had tubless tires coming out then now we got donut tires and spare tires so remember the first time ever seen one of them I said you going to put that on now we're going to go down the road little donut I said oh boy I don't know but it worked said oh I I said that what that is Bless but it don't so I was thinking you know it's something so we just a spare tire and uh you need one of those every once in a while so uh and so uh so this past the old country and that's all those things like that and a little heart I thought on my heart this morning to preach to you and uh if uh as brother Brown said if we could give it the way God give it to us as it see as he said in the woods it'd be it'd be something else but but may it be a blessing to you and to us as the Bride of Jesus Christ Exodus chapter 33 we want to read with uh verse uh nine and then we won't skip down we won't read this whole portion but just get a little thought here and it came to pass as Moses entered into the Tabernacle the Cloudy pillar descended and stood at the door of the Tabernacle and the Lord talked with Moses and all the people saw the Cloudy pillar stand at the Tabernacle door and all the people rose up and worshiped every man in his tent door and the Lord spake unto Moses face to face as a man speaketh unto his friend and he turned again into the camp but his servant Joshua the son of nun a young man departed not out of the Tabernacle and Moes Moses said unto the Lord see thou saith unto me bring up this people and thou has not let me know whom thou will send with me yet thou has said I Know Thee by name and thou has also found Grace in my sight now therefore I pray thee if I found Grace in thy sight show me now thy way that I may Know Thee that I may find Grace in thy sight and consider that this nation is thy people and he said my presence shall go with thee and I will give thee rest ain't that wonderful and he said unto him If thy presence go not with me Carri us not up hence what a humility for whn shall it be known that I and thy people have found Grace in thy sight is it not in that thou goest with us so shall we be separated and I love this I am thy people from all the people that upon the face of the earth and the Lord said unto Moses I will do this thing also that thou H has spoken for thou has found Grace in my sight and I Know Thee by name and then I like the words of Moses and he said I beseech you show me thy Glory let me read that again and he said I beseech you Show Me Your Glory yes and brother brandham said what was he asking God I want to see you yes sir H hell I want to see you I hear you speaking to me I saw Visions I've seen manifestations but his horse desire every Christian every believer Let Your Presence go with me but don't just let it be a presence I want to see who's talking to me and God granted it to him and I skip down verse uh 21 and the Lord said behold there is a place by me how many believes this too is a place by that's this lovely there is a place by me and thou shall stand upon a rock and it shall come to pass that while my glory passes by that I will put thee in the Cliff of The Rock and I will cover thee with my hand while I pass by and I will take away mine hand and thou shall see my back Parts but my face I shall not see so he looked and brother Brenham said when he looked and he saw he said it looked like a man and it was a man as he went by and he said when he looked at the back now Moses doesn't tell it here but we had a Vindicated Prophet that said when he saw his back it was a stripe back it was a bloody B now Moses doesn't share it and I don't know if brother brandham shares it if Moses understood that at that time I don't know he's a prophet but he saw him and God let him see him and may we pray this morning God I want to see and I want to bring something to you this morning and I've asked our brothers I don't know if they got the picture up here and uh you may be seated and while you're being seated let's go to the 11th chapter of the book of Hebrews and I want to read what the book of Hebrews says about this experience that Moses had if they can put that up there how many how many's familiar with this picture this is the love ofely the picture amen verse 27 in the book of Hebrews chapter 11 it says by faith he forsook Egypt Moses not fearing the Wrath of the king for he endured as seeing him who is invisible am and I want to take for a little subject this morning sin the Unseen and you know people people think you know the world you know when it messes believers they think we're crazy I mean even a little title like that seeing the Unseen brother Tim you just said it couldn't be seen and you telling me you you going to look at the Unseen Lally to be able to see the Unseen what is invisible brother brandham said we worship the invisible God Amen I can't see him in this building but I can look at you and I see the purchase of his blood I've heard the songs this morning and the hymn sung and I heard him in those songs M I've heard the prayer request we've heard the prayer and if you'll listen to uh always love to listen to especially message believer when they pray I like to listen to brother branham's prayers you ever noticed that he'll he'll give you Revelation in the prayers he's prayed and you'll see what he's talking He he'll just begin to talk and and you'll hear him say certain things that really stands out to you really helps you and encourages you what is that that's him that's the Unseen that's something that is unseen to the naked eye or the five senses and it can't literally be picked up by these eyes or naturally unless God makes a visible show and he can do that but there's something that a Christian as brother Bram said when mchis DEC came in to Abraham and he seen them coming he said you can't hide nothing from a Christian a Believer they know something's going on he might not could have put his finger on it at that time or explained it but you know something's going on here and when we come together and gather together in the lord's name and we come to this house of worship that we've D dedicated and committed to the place where we gathered together to hear the word of the Lord is something special about that's why we should go to church and that's why and I I always say this and I tell my church God has designed so you can go to church every day so what are you talking about you can put a CD in you can have church you can go down the road you can have church church you can gather in Fellowship around the word I like that God has done so much for me and you that this bride why just so she assured to get home it's a sure thing it ain't a maybe so we might get there this is a sure thing and what God done in this hour he has you know done different things in times past but what he done in this hour is not something that's goes on all the time it ain't something that is done you know it's actually according to the message of the hour this is the third time say third time huh this is the third time third time of what first time was with Moses second time was with Paul and the third time is this day you say what you talking about brother Tim something given to the people of God not a theologian not just a teacher not just coming in and gathering together but under the literal Pillar of Fire himself bringing forth uh message of redemption and what the need of the hour is verse special need amen and actually brother brandham refers to it as Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever and then he explains it gives us a little bit more illumination yesterday Moses today Paul amen forever today Glory here here present now doing this under a pillar of fire that the same Pillar of Fire and I quote this quote the same Pillar of Fire that gave uh that was with Moses and with Paul is the same Pillar of Fire here interpreting the word in this day Hallelujah not a different one the same one everybody say same one the same manifestation I just read to you they saw it the sin yeah they saw the pillar of fire descend come to the Tabernacle and saw it descend and talk to Moses yes sir amen mm as a friend talks to a friend that's pretty good relationship H and he comes down and he talks fath face to face with him so someone said well brother Tim you literally believe that that God will come down a certain type of caliber of a man yes that had to qualify with God see we can never be the prophet and I love what he said here I can never take Billy Graham's place people were down Billy Graham I could do what Billy Graham brother Bram said you couldn't I could never take Billy Graham's Place neither can Billy Graham take my place and neither can anybody take your place true a that wonderful so whatever God has ordained to walk with him be happy in how God has designed you and built you and made you because you are unique yes sir and he made you a part of this I'm just happy to be a part of this Hallelujah glory to God they saw the pillar of fir they saw the Cloudy pillar the sin talk to Moses Moses saw all of that manifestation it was there a cloud by day and it showed them from the sun and it kept them protected and no Army could approach them ain't that wonderful praise God and it it moved and when it moved they moved true and then it was a fire by night don't you think it gets cold on the desert oh yeah but there was a great big Pillar of Fire hanging there that was shining in the darkness and it was hanging wouldn't you just love to look up our looked at it Hallelujah they going to make pictures of it and all those things but it it doesn't it doesn't take give it the full F of what it is but God was there he was in there he was in that Pillar of Fire he was in that manifestation and he was talking to Moses as a friend personally coming down telling him and getting him and then brother Brenham says this is how it was actually only two people wrote the entire Bible said brother Bram said that yes he said actually only two people really wrote the scriptures the other ones wrote off of what they said Okay okay so that kind of checks people back but brother brandham said that he said that it was only two and that was Moses and Paul and they probably say disagree with me well let me explain it this way here it is Moses was given the five first five books of the Bible and he wrote some of the Psalms is that right Moses was a song writer and he wrote those things under the inspiration of God he even sung after they got across the Red Sea and let them in sng song of Moes and one day when they get over to Israel they'll sing the song of Moses again that's what the scripture says Moses was the greatest Prophet to Israel because he was the lawgiver and God talked to him face to face yes sir and God talk so you can't be wrong when the one that's given the word comes down literally and uh face to face and tell how you going to be off so that man don't know what he's talking about this one did I'm just laying a groundwork cuz I want to get to something here cuz I want to tell you hit greater today than it was then glory amen because he does something in this day Moses sewing him his back Parts yes yes it is oh I love it that's right Paul saw a pillar of fire hanging there literally burn his eyes out wow brighter and greater than the Noonday sun say that's what he say yeah he said I saw him it put my eyes out L but from that day he never changed his story even before the king and Festus and Agrippa at the end he said I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision and he said I've been through this I've been in the sea I've been rejected and everything but I was told by him yes to go to the Gentiles and to preach and to Clare and what things I was suffer for his name's sake is that right he would suffer for his name sight so Pillar of Fire Pillar of Fire special Moses wrote the books he goes back and gives us what Adam and Eve were doing the the beginning the first five books under a pillar of fire brother bham said writing was allowed to write scripture amen uhhuh and what is this oh they neglect oh they sell it every year it's Christmas time I'm sure it's they've been sold out and this is the best seller every year all the great best sellers all the books all the authors they can never out sell this why because brother Brenham said it's God in letter form praise God good believe that that's a form of him right there say Where's God that you know when you really looked at this message you know God is everywhere he's more places than you think he is I can look down this morning read that there he is I can hear the songs this morning there he is I can look at you there's the purchase of rill there he is I see people worshiping in here and saying hey man this morning what is that that's him in the Pew saying hey man back to his word mhm it's a truth what he is it seeing the Unseen they saw the one that was unseeable that's right they heard the one that was unhearable and Moses literally looked up on his form wow that's good think about it this wasn't some kind of play by night it wasn't something that somebody made up of some kind of superstition brother this was God literally coming down and doing a special work of redemption in that time what was it brother Brenham said it was God coming to fulfill his word and the promise that he had made to Abraham you're going down there but one day I'm coming to get you ain't that wonderful and I love when he appears to Moses on the back side of the desert I love this I'm sending you down Moses but I'm going down yes sir I'm going down I've heard the cries that's right they're crying and brother Bram said how does a a child get something that he needs from his parent or whatever God has provided a way might not like it when it's scream their thing their breath out and you go and you pick them up and they s them back down they scream again that's the provided way for them to communicate I need something and brother bham said God's way for his children always has been and always will be as you get between you and God and begin to cry to him begin to cry out to him and ask him you know what he'll come on the scene cuz if my children come to to me with tears in their eyes and pleaded I want to tell you I bankrupt myself is that right if you love them the right way if it's your children you'd bankrupt everything God would bankrupt heaven for you because you're his how much he love you how much he love them he said I'm going down amen and I'm going to take my paper it's going to be me mhm they saw a man and brother Bram said it was God they didn't understand it in a form of a man that was Moses so God was in a form am and he can take on any form mhm and to reveal himself because it's him and so when you look at these scriptures Moses endured because he saw the invisible God would it wouldn't it help you it's wonderful ain't it wouldn't it help you so he saw it and so they wrote the scripture is that right Moses wrote the scripture he wrote the law and he go to show you how much God loved him and how much God thought of him it's called to this day in your Bible Moses law so I thought that was God God didn't even put his name there he put Moses name now see we say he's the same yesterday today and forever and sometimes we don't literally understand what what he's really saying but the message explains it yesterday today yeah we know God still heals we know God still does those things but it goes beyond that there's no question that God's not not a Healer he's a Healer he's a he's a redeemer and he does all these things but God does it he never changes his plan when he does something he's going to do he never changes it or goes out of it that's how you know it's him Hallelujah ain't that wonderful prise God so when you look at that Moses pinned the word and all the other prophets wrote off of what he originally the inspiration the other the prophets cuz they always refer back to Moses and then they want to get on to us cuz we say we brother brandham said brother brandham said brother BR what you say brother brandham said well didn't they say brother Moses said sir and that seemed to be all right with God because he put it in the literal scripture Moses law not God's law God didn't even put his name in there now think about this yeah they say I've had people say bro Tim F this mess has messed you up you you you you crazy it's run you crazy well as brother bham said leave me alone I'm better off this way than I was the other way amen they going to call us this and that and anyway no matter what you anyway so he might as well just DP up her and everything yeah that's right looking at me amen I'm not ashamed of what I believe I'm not ashamed of this message I'm not ashamed that God came the same way and done more in this hour than he ever done cuz this time all the saints are going to rise this time the graveyard is going to be empty this time we're going to gather together here and I want to tell you something you might think I'm crazy but they ain't no old people Ain going to be in there because we talk about youth Gatherings and and we have youth meetings and everything well I'm going to be a part of the greatest youth meeting one of these days it's ever been when we all gather together one morning and then we're going to let walk off the face of this Earth so I know you was crazy Tim for me you're talking crazy stuff now on one morning my Daddy's going to come back to my door cuz I have a Vindicated prophet and he's going to say hello son and he's going to be younger than I I am he's going to be 18 years old again is that right I won't see Bill farmer the way he was the last time when I looked at that decrepit body and that sickness and the heart attack that cook him out of here he'll be Bill farmer I got a picture of him sitting there on on my man there where at my house in my picture album that's what he's going to look like when he comes back and it's going to say son I'm back it's just about time it's about home time and we're getting ready to get out of here why brother Tim it's going to be by the grace of almighty God because he lets you know that you were a part of this that you were his seed and that all that you ever loved that's what brother Bram said all that ever loved you and all that you ever love you'll be there don't you never give up on your children don't you you be like Moses Pharaoh say well you can take some of it and you know go out there and sacrifice to the Lord a little religious ceremony oh that Just Tires me up when people just want oh oh so formal and so this and that and it's so dry oh I want to tell you no we ain't going everything down to the hoof of a calf we're going to take it we're going to take our children we're going to take our cows we're going to take everything that is our possession and that's what you going to do you're going to let them go amen nobody ever talked the Pharaoh like that cuz you got to understand Pharaoh is a god he's their son God but so actually that's two Gods there which when a one of my two Gods organ Moses god that's what brother Brenham said said come here Aaron I'm going to make Moses God he can't talk that good so I'm going to help him how I'm going to bring you I'm going to make Moses god to you and you're going to be his Prophet what people look at say well Tim F you are off your roer now you mean to tell me God makes a man God now listen to me don't you do what other people's run off and say brother brenham's virgin born he said he wasn't said but Tim or you de no [Music] I ain't this that and everything I'm just telling you that's how special it was yeah that God could put Moses's name in there because Moses represented God to the people and what he said was not Moses words it was the literal words of God being spoke through human lips you say that's farfetched then what do you celebrate this time of year the world are they worshiping a baby come on they're worshiping a baby they're worshiping this and all these things of this festive season and I know what brother Brenham said about it and you stay right down the middle of the road with it mm you know people want to argue over little fine points of Doctrine and brother B say if there any questions or something they want to keep a question going all the time he said don't you get involved with that because I'm going to tell you something here this morning before my time's away that we don't have to doubt anything this is the most important thing what this message was about was not final points of Doctrine and what this message was about was not to argue over this and over that what this message was about was somebody come down in this hour and he said he's here it's always been this coming together this morning that it's in vain if we're not here because of a person Hallelujah this message is not a Doctrine this message is not some kind of theological seminar that we're going to go to this message is God coming down in person you believe that y'all crazy and I am it's good to be a part of the group ain't if bird of feather flock together so you tell me and you think God is you you think God is literally here oh yes brother renham says this my Ministry is to declare yes sir that he's here I believe so where him I thought he's coming one day let me go further brother around you hear him on the tapes over and over and 30 years ago when to come in the message didn't understand what he's talking about but doday amen he said God is here in the form of the Holy Ghost how many's ever heard him say amen God is here in the form of the Holy Ghost that light that you see on the picture that light he says many times it's standing just a few feet from me that's right yes sir and he said when he was young and he would talk about it they' look at him funny like you know well okay you saw something and he describe what he saw and and then the pictures started being taken he said now they can't no I'm told I've told that's what sayen and for a man to come into a service and get up and say this he said and you know I'm waiting on someone and I love this and I'm just as helpless as you are I like an honest Prophet is that right I'm just inadequate and this as helpless as you are and I'm waiting for someone to come and then he'd say he's here and when he said he's here he'd say now now I take authority uhoh he said well where's God at see brother Brenham said you know God can do all things some me raise your hand praise the Lord I have my church praise the Lord but I don't get real big H praise the Lord when I say this come on brother Ram said that God believed his own word in beginning and created the whole world Amen said God can do anything brother Brenham turns around and said God turns around on you in this day and said if you believe there's nothing impossible with you either Hallelujah I he believes there's nothing impossible With God all things are possible but then he then the prophet turns it around on us and puts it back God he said God put it back in your lap that's right turns it back around and puts it back in your lap what do you say about it there's nothing impossible with God and if you'll believe and say it he said there won't be nothing impossible with you amen amen that's right the Lord this how you do God put it back in John Ryan comes through the line brother Brenham sees he tells him that uh you know God's healed him he's he's he's blind he's a Catholic he goes all the way back around where his his eyes is not open he's still blind yeah brother brandham has talked to him brother Bram has prayed for him yeah true so he goes back and gets back in the LIE he comes back through brother BR said I've already prayed for you but he said I'm still blind and I said this one time and the little lady after your church I at my church come and talk to him said brother Tim I don't understand something I want to ask you something said what brother Brenham told that little woman little man I said what was it sister said when he got back in line he come back through he said why' you come back through here and be prayed for again he said because I'm still blind and this is what brother Brenham said to him what's that got to do with it and this little sister bless her little heart make me back out she's sincere she said brother Tim cuz he's blind it don't have nothing to do with iten brother Bram said uh I seen in a vision I seen you got your eyesight he said see God puts it back in your lap yes all these things it's put back in your La Lord God's done everything that he can do all right turns it back and puts it back in your lab and John Ryan said well what am I supposed to do I'm still blind you said you so the vision I'm going to get my eyes say what am I supposed to do I'm blind I love this he said well go thank God for heing you amen cuz he's already healed you we already said saved we are healed brother bham said you come to a time in your life you realize you always were saved and then you come time in your life in this message you you realize you Eternal is God is eternal not your being here but where you come from that's right that's exactly right uhoh that's all right PR on brother brother Tim I don't know what you've been looking at what you listening you you talking weird stuff he said you're just as atonal as God and and I said this one Sunday morning morning in my church and I said oh my goodness I said they can't kill me I've had people threat my life you know why I've had up where I'm my eara just cause I baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and and they come they used to come right down by my house and go shoot me scar my wife and she scar my wife and and course I I said you can't kill me I said well we'll show you you can't kill me if it's my my time to go I'll go I believe that 100% how about you amen you can't kill me no more you can kill God that's right oh I feel good don't you brother brother Brotherman said that's why Paul they didn't have to drag him to The Chopping Block he run true true and why did he run because he run because he said he knew that he was a possessor of eternal life and in this hour what we know we come from God and we're going back to God Amen is that right amen we come from there and I'm going back to there and ain't nothing can change in that right am so that's the things we should be talking aboutall that takes it all way don't it that helps us don't it oh my to be able to see what we've seen in our day that's right to be able to know what God done in this hour he let you in on it because you come from him that's right that's right brother name now W you listen don't let my time get away give me about 20 more minutes here listen listen to this brother brandham said God is here in the form of the Holy Ghost and the same message under a pillar of fire that Moses had and that Paul had is the same God that's here doing these things that you see done Amen on that it's more than a man that it's more than a Ministry that it's more than just some preacher and some group or some Gathering that it is God himself literally coming down and perform form in and doing the same things that he always done Plus in this hour we can put that there plus because nobody know what laid under those seals matter of fact the whole Bible was soed up with him huh that's right the first church age Messengers seen through her glass Darkly but he said out there face to face it's going to be a face to face it's going to be somebody come it's something going to go in up there that ain't going on back here here is he's here and all of these things Paul said that the things that I do has Christ in me it's Christ doing it he said even to the point that they baptized in Paul's name help yourself po boy he raped them for that is that right same thing in this hour they were baptizing brother bram's name and he went off the field for a little while he said they made me an antichrist so as what the prophet had to say about it that right said they made me Antichrist they asked him a question brother brandham or you the angel or you the pillar of fire what is all of that he said that's not him huh he said but he's here in spirit form he said he's here said well we see the picture it's taken in 195 now that's a colored picture that's but it was original black and white that right literally black and white all the other pictures literally black and white and I just love this God wanted you to see something in this hour and he wanted you to see him in color come on you say brother brandom said that yeah now I don't know if they got the VD the the now it's about two minutes so I'm going to let the prophet tell you okay I just I always tell people this I always tell the Miss and everything I said I'm just trying to be a good repeater yeah amen CU this is a perfect message and to repeat it and say what was said is that's what we need to do and stay with that but ain't nobody can say it like he can say it is that right do do you have that audio so so now he's going to talk about this picture and he talks about this the only one in color all the one's black and white and I thought and and I went back yesterday and I'll tell you after you get through talking here cuz I looked up what he said there what it was how they developed that picture and why because how many ever seen the old black and white photographs that's all people had then wasn't it it's all black and white but I was thinking about this and what what I was going to preach to you this morning and God come and full color to us and at that time up to that time probably 20 years before this they had developed color film and there's just a few films and few things that was in color and then later on how many members Kodak and the instant they got an instant well remember remember when you had to take it and you had to send it off remember and come back and you know and it was it was it was a a a really technolog that they' never had before and I thought ain't that wonderful God wanted me to see what Ezekiel Saw what John saw oh yes and what brother BR was talking about that he wasn't far far away this God that we love and worship oh amen but he always accompanies this message amen yes this message so if you have the audio gave her a moment there cuz I wasn't sure if the audio go ahead now listen to The Prophet I said Do you believe it and now to the secret to my church as you know my min is changing and oh what a glorious change Hallelujah all of you remembers the words that's been ringing and every time it happens something happens when I go into to speak on that come come to me say to this mountain why has it been it's been Faith anything is by faith faith is not something that you work up Faith is something that you have and I thought if I always been ashamed of my faith but people as good as the Lord has been he has showed things told Visions everything has been perfect you people know that it's not an individual it's not a man it's God that does it and this picture here how one over the world the ones in Germany and here a few weeks ago maybe the strangers you're never s they caught another one I got it at home it's a profile of the Lord Jesus standing right behind where I was standing and his hands are out and tongues are fire flying all from his hand while I was speaking on the subject say to this mountain be moved and don't doubt in your heart but believe and we've got it it's in Technic caom colors and they got it at the home now and they're making it's been examined but now by science and so forth in Laboratories and it'll be out pretty soon another which makes about six of them now in different places that's been took this is the most outstanding of all of them never seen there's his his beard his face his profile his arms hanging out now standing right in like this and where he's got his arms you can't even see a place of it like at my head then my feet down to the floor just head and feet that's all was left see and he and he's standing with his arms right like this and I got my hands out like this of preaching saying say to this mountain and about that time something took place and snap the picture of it like that and there it was behind all In Colors the big so as God does arrange a big basket of cow L sitting close he's a lily of the valley and where do you get opium out of Lies that's right what ain't that wonderful Moses saw his backp Paul saw pillar fire saw him in Vision there he is and I never noticed I've had this picture for 30 years more you ever notice this there's the Capstone Lord and his face if you got one at [Music] home is right in that Capstone looking right at us literally brother B said God is here literally in person pise and we have the privilege there's no other privilege and I'm going to close no other people right Moses saw his back Parts brother Brown said that Moses put a veil over his his face because the word was in his head and his mouth but on in Matthew 17 when Jesus God performed the great adoption with his son his whole being glistened because he was all of it amen and when brother brandham talked about this and and if you listen to him go back and listen to him he said this is the most outstanding of all of them that's right I've had people tell me this year different ones it's up to them tuck this picture down took this picture down H away writing newspaper article and all these things and his poor journalism ain't brother going to quote him quote it all amen is that that's the right way uhhuh and I told someone the other day I said well they're they're reading the message more now and quot quoting it more now than when they was claimed to be a part of him amen I ain't mad nobody that's right you know what the more it goes on more go on I see how much the grace of God has opened my eyes amen who am I thank you Lord who am I where did I come from why do I see the things I see why do I know the things that I know why do I live the way I live why do I say the things I say preach the things that I preach stand for the things we stand when everything's against you and and it looks like it ain't the right thing or all of those things everybody's telling you that but what you see oh that's what I've been looking for brother brandom said when this message is revealed to you you'll never see anything else right because when we come down to it folks what this message was about is him we can get him to a church as brother Bram said get him to church get them to this get them to a Doctrine get them to a gathering but how means getting them to Christ God help us brother Braham said God is here form and we have the privilege to look at the form God coming literally in form and showing himself that which was before the beginning amen amen we see him the Lord John 17 and and we'll close with this Jesus said glorify me with the glory I had with you before the world was that's it I think it's answered how about you there you there you have we seen the Unseen am do we know someone standing there and he ain't way way far way across the Milky wave and you had to come to a temple or anywhere else they standing in the S brother hamers and he's the same yesterday today and for him he's present here this morning and if we believe him be healed how did John Ryan get his healing brother Braham said thank God for it and he stopped the meeting every night get ready to start the meeting he get up from the balcony everybody sit down and be quiet John Ryan would do that they thought who's this nut quiet and down thank God for healing me amen amen that's all he say sit down and start the service next night qu down thank God for healing me brother BR said went through the whole meeting never happened went home sold papers for a living Come On Come and Get It Come and read about it praise God for healing me in between saying that praise God so he had to get a haircut one day God knows what put you know sitting in a barber's chair bar begin to talk to him said John you know you making a literal fool out of yourself come on come on you've been up Earth them Holy Rollers don't call us that no more but been up Earth them holy R and I don't know what's going on but people are talking about you you just a blind you ever was and in the midst of that that guy talking he said be quiet yeah thank God for healing me and this time what happened happen manifestation yes yes God's no Li yes sir God said so it can never fail is that right how about you today as we close I think I can believe a god like that there he is and not only the him but he's in full color yeah yeah that's good brother that's good good point and as we close Koda Chrome technology was developed by Kodak as a breakthrough in production of making films or 35 MIM cameras at that time think about it that time it was devel just in time that's kind of strange but I well all the other ones are black and whes but the last two praise God because there he is and then the last one was in 1963 on the mountain yeah and the head of Christ it went to look magazine and Life Magazine there years D years in bodily form brother Bram seen that picture and he said you ain't looking at it right the Holy Spirit did he said what you mean he say he right way taking in thing turn it to the right and when he turned it to the right there's Jesus there's the head there's his face there's his eyes there's his nose now here it is as we close me and you have got to see what none of the other Saints I down Through the Ages got to see that's true Lord it should make us a different people amen it should not be when we come in here churches usual it should not be oh I wonder if God's going to ever do this no I'm looking for him to do it amen don't know when don't know how don't know how it's going to develop but some hores how many's got lost children in here look it look at the three I mean he's got needs that haven't been mad things you're praying about ain't come on to seen you but the one that is with us and stands he can made every bit of it tonight this morning is that right would you stand with me and get the musicians to [Music] come now I don't know what you need is but as they come then I give you this quote [Music] [Music] brother Brenham says this he said how many knows there's a difference between between the appearing of Christ and the coming of Christ he says two different words and he says it's too different the appearing and the coming will will be and he says we see today and he used the word appearing in his church doing the same works and doing the same things he always done I like it don't [Music] you and who is this mckade he says this God has never left the Earth that he has always been here in some form amen I love that don't you and brother Brenham said I'm glad that is cu
