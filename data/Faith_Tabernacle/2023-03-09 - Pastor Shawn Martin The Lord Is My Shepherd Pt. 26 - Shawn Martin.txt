invite our pastor to come doesn't matter what we see good times or bad times he's still God and he's on the throne you are not a God created by human hands you are not a god dependent on any mortal man you are not a god [Music] that's just the way it is you are from Before Time on your throne you are God in the good times you are on your throne you are God you're the only God whose power none

alone times amen throne Throne to our God unstoppable that's what you are changeable I'm unshakable unstoppable that's what you are [Music] tall you are gone well aren't you glad he's God and that we're not amen I'm so glad that I'm not and um I'm glad that he is amenities he's Eternal self-existent amen and he's on the throne in need of no one amen and can work outside the rim of our ability our thoughts amen and I'm so glad for that amen and I tell you what if we'd understand that God is God we we probably wouldn't worry as much try to fix things on our own and tried to you know try to make things happen but just God's God and I think the bride is coming to that place more and more that he's God he's God Alone and we don't need to worry about anything just trusting and let him work it all out amen and I think the more we surrender to him and just let him have his way the musicians can be dismissed if you have your Bibles we're going to turn to Psalms the 23rd chapter and it's could have brother Shaman sister Bethany back with us amen and brother Andrew's mom amen God bless you good to have you as always amen and um we just love the Lord but Psalms the 23rd chapter we're going to start at the first verse it says the Lord is my shepherd I shall not one he maketh me to lie down in Green Pastures eliteeth me beside the Still Waters he restoreth my soul he leadeths me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake praise the Lord let's just bow our heads and talk to our father Lord Jesus we're so glad that you are on your throne Lord and that you alone are God father and that you reign in your kingdom your throne is for eternity father and time doesn't stop it Lord situations that come up doesn't stop it critics don't stop it the enemy can't stop it Lord there is no devil of in hell that can stop or Dethrone you father and Lord we rejoice in the fact that we're your people Lord and that we're in your hands and I pray father that you would come in a supreme way this evening and move Lord and every devil of hell that would try to hinder this service I pray that you had binded in the name of Jesus Christ and father May the Liberty flow among your people oh God any doubt any unbelief any skepticism father that would arise Lord we pray that you would subdue it any sickness father any discouragement father I pray that you would subdue it here tonight and may your word Reign Among Us in Jesus Christ's name we pray and the church says amen and amen you can have your seats this evening and I'm going to continue along the subject and just failed to go this direction some more and that is he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness and um we know that God in every age has allotted his word from the beginning he's not trying to draw out a plan uh today but he's already drawn that plan out it's it's from the beginning and we've read this scripture there the prophet Isaiah 46 and 9. it says God says remember the former things of old for I am God and there is none else I am God and there is none like me declaring the end from the beginning and from ancient times to things that are not yet done saying my counsel shall stand and I will do all my pleasure calling a ravenous bird from the East the man that executeth my counsel from a far country yeah I have spoken it I will also bring it to pass I have purposed it I will also do it amen so we we find as as we've uh just uh been looking at this that brother Branham said righteousness is the word of God Amen so he leads us in the paths of righteousness in the paths of the word of God the Bible talking of Noah said he was a preacher of righteousness he was in other words he he preached the word for his day amen and so it was he was considered a preacher of righteousness and and you know I would say that as preachers that are preaching this message are we're preachers of righteousness amen and uh I I that's an honor to be uh hold that title amen and I believe that for a man to walk the paths of righteousness is to fulfill the word of God for this day or for his day and and so we we know that the word of God that God has allotted for this day it must be fulfilled it's it there there's no if ands or buts about it it must be fulfilled and and so Jesus said there uh uh I believe uh dwelled to John maybe in Matthew but he said it becometh us to fulfill all righteousness as it is it becometh a doctor to work in medicine and it becomes an electrician to work with electricity it becomes the painter to work with paint amen then it becomes the Believers to fulfill all righteousness it's it's just something that we do and so Jesus knew that when he had come uh that that he was to fulfill the word uh uh uh for his day there was a portion of word allotted a man for for him and so he knew uh uh and I think this is important that he knew that he was the sacrificial lamb he he knew that and so he had to fulfill every type of of a natural lamb uh that the natural lamb spoke of he was born at the same time uh Lambs were born he was born in the same environment that Lambs were born in as a sacrificial lamb he had to be washed before presented uh he had to be killed in the evening time and it had to be done before the high priest for he was the lamb and and so he had to fulfill uh all righteousness and he he also knew that he was the high priest and and so he he had to fulfill every type of the high priest in the in the Old Testament he had to be washed with water water before he could be anointed and he had to be anointed before he could offer the the sacrifice in the presence of God Amen and he knew these things and I think that's important he was aware of this he knew that he was to preach the gospel to the poor and to preach the acceptable year of the Lord he knew that he was sent to heal the brokenhearted and to preach Deliverance to the captives and the recovering of sight to the blind he knew that he was to sit at Liberty them that are bruised the prophet said he knew that he he was sent for a Divine Purpose and he was determined to fulfill it for he knew what the Lord had said so he could place himself in the scriptures and knew that his life was to fulfill the prophecy he did not stumble along trying to figure it out trying to to figure out his purpose and wondering amen what the will of God was for his life he didn't walk around you know walk blindly and ignorantly not knowing the will of God for his day a man at the prophet said he believed what God Said was truth and he believes what God Said is the truth amen he believed a man what God Said was the truth and the words must be fulfilled and he knew what his life was to fulfill them see he was anointed and and so he was there for a Divine Purpose a man and so John even bore record of that saw the spirit of God like in the uh unto a dove descending down upon him and he heard a voice saying this is my uh beloved Son in whom I am pleased to dwell in a man and the prophet Prophet said it was God and man becoming one uniting together for Redemption so so as as Jesus was fulfilling the purpose of God for his life yet he knew that it was for a greater purpose a man and so there it was God and man God and human uh uh flesh uh uniting as one for Redemption a man and Redemption of who it would be his elect he come to redeem his elect do you believe that a man and so we we find that the the god of SP of all that covers space in time he he bottled himself into a human being amen and so that he could taste death amen for for the human race and and so it was as the prophet said it was the creator dying for his creation and and that was the purpose everything that Jesus done was to uh to open up the way and uh for Humanity for God to reconcile with man a man and so the prophet said God and man became one so that he could dwell in man and fellowship and it was God condescending trying to get uh to get to his man ain't that right so Jesus he had a direct purpose he knew he was the lamb he knew that he was the offering and the sacrifice the substitute and everything he'd done was for that purpose us a man to reconcile to show God unto human unto man and so he knew what his life was to fulfill now as we look at that day and we look at this day because we say that he's the same yesterday today and forever amen then then we find that he still knows the purpose amen he's still for this day amen and and I believe the bride understand and in his uh through the message of the hour uh the redeemed of the Lord is understanding their purpose and has the same understanding that Jesus did back then and has the the uh uh and and has that purpose a man for the prophet said she is flesh of his flesh he is bone of his bone she is life of his life she is him power of his power amen so as as he understood good and and his purpose so does the bride today understand their purpose amen now the churches don't understand their purpose because they're not part of him a man but every individual that makes up that bride they understand their purpose and their calling a man and and they they have this understanding and I'm so glad that God sent us a message to to to give us that understanding now the prophet said notice the harmony of the father and the son Jesus never did anything until it was first showed him by the father a man he said now this harmony is now to exist between the groom and the bride and his bride he shows her his Word of Life she receives it she never doubts it so think of that now and he reveals to her his Word of Life this this word that is for today and she receives it and never doubts it therefore nothing can harm her not even death for if the seed be planted the water will raise it up again and notice what he says here is the secret the word is in the bride the word is in the bride see as it was in Mary a man see it was revealed to Mary a man what her purpose was and what was happening and she said that be it unto me according to Thy word and so as it was in Mary so is the word in us the bride has the mind of Christ ain't that rhyme and she knows what he once done with the word and notice she performs the command of the word in his name for she has thus saith the Lord amen so how blessed we are to live in the this day a man not a people uh without understanding not a people that is groping in the darkness a man but a people that has understanding for he has shown us his word of life amen and she performs it in his name amen I truly believe that what Paul had prayed a man has now been made uh fulfilled a man for our eyes the eyes of our understanding has been enlightened Amen to know what is the hope of his calling we're too late in the game to be wondering what God has amen for the church what God has for this bride amen we're too too late in the game to be playing games and and and and all of these things amen but you see the entire Church of the Living God not in entire fake Tabernacle not in time entire evening like Tabernacle but the entire Church of the Living God is built upon the revelation of Jesus Christ ain't that right for we know that all the word for our day must be fulfilled we know that it's it's not guesswork we know amen that this word is going to be fulfilled in our day but what's the most beautiful thing is is we have an understanding that we're part of this age amen and we're part amen of the word for this hour amen just as Jesus knew the word he knew what was to be fulfilled in his day he ain't that right amen that's why he didn't go and stagger over you know uh uh to the the Pharisee trying to get his purpose amen from the Pharisee amen the father had showed him amen it was revealed to him in the Bible ain't that right amen see the Pharisee didn't understand his uh Jesus's purpose and and many mom the multitude didn't understand the purpose that Jesus had but it was divinely revealed to him of what his life was to fulfill and so do we know what is to be fulfilled in our day that's why we're not listening to uh to the traditions of man we're not listening to the doctors and of divinity that's why we don't we're not finding our purpose in the colleges and seminaries and the theologians and all the books that they're writing that's that we're not finding our purpose in there can you say man amen and Jesus knew I I thought of that he so knew how that that his purpose for the day that he knew how to place the scriptures now notice Isaiah 61 speaks of Christ the spirit of the Lord is upon me because the Lord has just anointed me to preach the Good Tidings unto the meek he has sent me to bind up the Brokenhearted to Proclaim Liberty to the captives and the opening of the prison to them that are bound to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord and the day of Vengeance of our God to comfort all that mourn so this scripture this this passage of scripture speaks of Christ ain't that right but notice when Jesus quotes this scripture there I believe it's in Luke amen he stops he say he he pre he says to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord and then he stops he did not go any further a man because he understood a man that the rest of that scripture did not apply to him at that time ain't that right amen so here was a prophecy a man here was a scripture that was speaking of two events it was speaking of the same person Christ but it was speaking of two events but God or Jesus and knowing their wisdom and understanding amen how to place the scriptures ain't that right a man see so uh because when he come the day of Vengeance wasn't for that day the prophet said that's for his second coming ain't that right so here Jesus I could stop and and place the scriptures exactly where they belong a man and and so he knew what scriptures to apply for his date and he knew what scriptures to apply for another time a man see and so we we find uh how could he do this it's because they're Isaiah prophesied in Isaiah 11 and 2 saying the spirit of the Lord shall rest upon Him speaking of Christ a man and the spirit of wisdom and understanding the Spirit of counsel and might the spirit of knowledge and of the fear of the Lord and shall make him of quick understanding in the fear of the Lord ain't that right so when Jesus come he had wisdom he had understanding he had that that ability you see that anointing but look at Ephesians there in in one in 16 Paul wrote saying about the church he says I ceased not to give thanks for you making mention of you in my prayer that the god of our Lord Jesus Christ the father of Glory may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and Revelation in the knowledge of him ain't that right amen so so the Same Spirit of wisdom The Same Spirit of Revelation and understanding that was upon Christ is upon the church today amancy and and and and to give us he says see that the spirit of wisdom and Revelation in the knowledge of him and he is the word ain't they right amen so so there is a people that could look at that word today amen and place the scriptures exactly where it belongs amen that's right Amen to think of it that we used to be confused we didn't understand where to place the scriptures amen and no wonder the devil could work on us and beat us up and and and and have us convinced that we're going in a tribulation and have us Convent amen that we could actually cross the line of uh to where uh commit the unpardonable sin but through the wisdom and revelation of understanding the word of God for this day we realize that a Believer cannot cross that line uh a Believer will never go into the tribulation a Believer amen will never amen see uh so but but we're understanding that the scriptures there are scriptures that belong to us that must be fulfilled can you say Amen could you imagine how can you have rapturing faith if you don't know if you're really going in a Rapture amen if the scripture ain't made known to you amen and you don't know you read about the Rapture you read about the tribulation you read about Hell Fire and Damnation you read about heaven you read about the white Throne judgment and if there's no quick understanding and Revelation in you amen how can you build faith upon if you don't know what's what can you say amen and Satan was good at working on our feelings when you don't feeling them scriptures of of damnation come alive to us when you're on the real on the Mountaintop and in Revival then these scriptures of Heaven Come Alive to us and it's just a topsy-turvy amen but this bride today has got a quick understanding the spirit of Revelation and the spirit of wisdom and understanding is upon her now in Proverbs 2 and 10 when wisdom entereth into thine heart and knowledge is Pleasant unto thy Soul discretion shall preserve thee ain't that right now that's what that's what we need ain't that right understanding shall keep thee amen think of that now amen see when you're in the trials and when you're going through things and and and your your flesh is and your feelings and your senses are backsliding on your hand and and and and and you once felt God now you don't feel him he's on the Mountaintop now you don't know where you felt is love now you don't know and all of these things it's just topsy-turvy topsy-turvy that notice when wisdom enters into thine heart and knowledge is Pleasant unto thy Soul discretion shall preserve thee can you say man whether you're on the Mountaintop or whether you're not discretion shall preserve thee and knowledge or under standing shall keep thee ain't that right so this is why Jesus when he didn't always feel I don't believe he always felt God I don't believe that he always felt like he was uh uh uh called I mean because he was he was tempted just like all of us he went through the trials just like you and I he knows what a preacher feels like he knows what a daddy feels like he knows what a mama feels like he he knows amen what the laity feels like he knows what the weakest Christian feels like amen there he was he had his headaches he had his trials he had his Temptations He had all of that ain't that right that one thing that never left him is he knew who he was he knew that he was to fulfill the word amen even in golgoth or at at the Garden of Gethsemane he would say father if it be thy will let this cup pass for me he didn't want to go that way the flesh was crying out amen but he knew enough to know that nevertheless thy will be done he knew he was called for it amen now you think of it the scriptures are like a jigsaw puzzle a man and if a man doesn't uh uh get the the the the pieces placed in the right position see then he will get the scene all mixed up ain't that right brother Brown says what if you had a picture of a great beautiful countryside and a cow picking grass up in the top of the tree he's now see that wouldn't be right would it because she don't pick grass in the top of a tree well he says in another place the holy spirit is the only one who can reveal reveal it ain't that right amen see we're talking about the paths of righteousness now the Holy Ghost is the only one that can reveal it to us for it is hid from the eyes of the wise and prudent it's revealed to babes such as with learn so if you don't watch you you don't if you don't use the mind of the Holy Spirit to put it together you'll have your scene all mixed up can you say man you'll have the bride going into tribulation instead of uh on a Rapture you you'll just have everything just topsy-turvy it'll all just be messed up ain't that right amen so thank God Amen that that we have the spirit of wisdom and Revelation amen see we got to know what Paths of righteousness a man that is leading us on amen that's right see and so Jesus was the word made flesh so he he was anointed a man to make the scriptures come together so to make the picture come out right ain't that right amen he was anointed a man to fulfill every scripture pertaining him and he made the picture turn out right amen see and so it is it today the Bride is a word word bride do you believe that amen see Jesus think of it now he knew he was amen now the priest they just kept on offering sacrifices like normal but Jesus didn't go that way did he because he knew he was the lamb he knew that he had a scripture to fulfill amen that's right see so he didn't get it mixed up he didn't get everything all just uh uh uh uh uh confused there and so you being a word bride you are anointed for this age to fulfill every scripture to make the picture turn out right can you say amen amen you know that this is the church has had the cow eaten on the top of the tree too long amen that the church amen is has got everything confused amen for too long but there is a bride that is not confused she's not confused in this age for she knows she's been given the spirit of Revelation and of understanding so so as Jesus fulfilled his part of the word so you're here to fulfill your part of the word in this age ain't that right now notice the word being fulfilled Abel we talked about I believe last uh a couple weeks ago but uh uh Abel fulfilled the word that was revealed to him and and showing that he was righteous Noah fulfilled the word that was revealed to him showing that he was righteous Abraham fulfilled the word that was revealed to him showing that he was righteous a man all the way down they they fulfilled the word that was revealed to them ain't that right but then in Jesus's day all the word that had been revealed to the prophets a man had spoke of him here he come fulfilling it all ain't that right amen he fulfilled it all amen that's right see amen see so it it showed see what had been revealed to Abel what had been revealed to Ezekiel a man what had been revealed to Isaiah what had been revealed to Moses to David to Noah to to all the prophets amen Jesus came to full feel because he was the Revelation a man that came to them ain't that right he was the Revelation no or Abel he he had the Revelation that it was a lamb amen but what it was that lamb was speaking of Jesus Christ and so when Jesus come he fulfilled amen what Abel had Saul amen see so he was the Revelation in the lamb he was the Revelation in the building of the Ark he was the Revelation in the in The Mercy Seat he was the Revelation in the high priest he was the Revelation in the altar he was the Revelation in the moment he was the Revelation in the in the Passover he was the Revelation in it of it all ain't that right amen and here he comes to fulfill all righteousness oh there was a lot for him to fulfill ah my he he there and he did not skip one of them he fulfilled everyone to the letter ain't that right amen but to think of that it didn't just speak of his day this Bible speaks of us as well do you believe that now a man sees so so Jesus was the Revelation in Isaac being offered up amen he was the Revelation in David being rejected as as king and coming back into Power he was the Revelation in Joseph's life he was the Revelation in boaz's life he was the he was the Revelation amen and sold the time now had come for the Revelation to be made manifest and fulfilled ain't that right hey man all that they lived out in in their lives amen they were speaking of one to come amen and here he was now amen not talking of something to come but he was saying I am the one I am the one Abraham saw my day and rejoice I am he ain't that right everything down amen they saw him he was the will in the middle of the wheel that Ezekiel Saul ain't that right amen that's right see so he knew Jesus knew that he was the Revelation amen that they of of what they had amen Saul he knew that every type and Shadow amen uh uh of Messiah of the Lamb of the altar all these things spoke of him he knew that and so he was there to fulfill all righteousness think of that now how perfect a word was the Revelation that came to the prophets was so perfect amen and yet a man would come and so perfect was his life amen that he fulfilled every one of them hey man that's awesome ain't that right what was it no man could do that it was God in Christ a man that was living the word out amen and so is it today there cannot be one scripture that pertains this bride go undone it cannot be messed up and it won't be messed up can you say amen for the same God that was in Christ is in this bride amen how is it going to do it I don't know but this word will be fulfilled in human flesh it will be now the prophet said when with Jesus when he came he said he'd come to fulfill the word of God what the prophets had said he come to fulfill the prophecy of the Old Testament now the holy spirit is here to fulfill the prophecy of the New Testament ain't that right amen think of that now amen now now this is why you are the Revival if you're part of the Bride you're you're of the Revival you're the thing that's going on can you say man no one can take your place amen I don't care how low you feel how insignificant you feel amen uh if you're part of this bride you're here to fulfill it and you will fulfill it amen you're not too insignificant for God ain't that right yes sir amen so John 14 and 16. Jesus says that I will pray the father and he shall give you another comforter that he may abide with you forever even the spirit of Truth whom the world cannot receive because it seeth him not neither knoweth him but you know him for he dwells with you and shall be in you I will not leave you comfortless I will come to you yet a little while and the world seeth me no more but you see me because I live you shall live all soul and at that day and we always say it but the prophets had put it to our day this day ain't that right aren't you glad that we can place that word now amen not for some far off not some past event but it's for this day right now thank God for Spirit of wisdom and Revelation amen at that day you shall know that I am in my father you in me and I in you my you know the prophet talking about people prostrating themselves before Idols they prostrate themselves before a god of stone marble wood or whatever it would be and and they they do that because they believe that God is in there and and and and and in that in that title but the prophet says and we all know it by experience that God is not an idol he is a spirit and the spirit don't come into some Idol as some so-called Christians would have us to believe but the spirit comes into you you are God's house living walking around manifesting the Living God for God dwells not in temples made with hands but a body hast thou prepared me ain't that right you are God's letter you are God's letter think of that all the prophecies that was written in the Scrolls Jesus now become that Living Word ain't that right now he's looking at you and saying you are God's letter God's letter see oh my God's not needing to write a new Bible he has taken his spirit amen and coming into you and making this word amen live through your flesh see God is in you see you're a written epistle God is in you manifesting himself through if you could prostrate yourself before God and say God I'm a sinner come into me and then the Holy Spirit comes in then you're a living Idol of God living representative of God walking around with God speaking through your lips to others think of it your hands are his hands your feet are his feet your eyes your ears are his eyes and ears amen everything see God long for amen Christ fulfilled it amen through his Redemptive work amen to show that he was that true sacrificial lamb now God has that that made a way for God to come into you and I as mortal beings and fulfill an eternal perfect Divine word amen through our mortal bodies First Corinthians 6 19 what Paul says no you not that your body is the Temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you which you have of God and you are not your own for you are bought with the price therefore glorify God you'll either glorify God or you'll glorify the devil amen that's exactly right you'll be a slave to the enemy to the devil or you're going to be a slave to God you'll be a prisoner to hold a negative and everything that the world has or you'll be a prisoner to God in his word and his promises that he says therefore glorify God in your body and in your spirit which are gods ain't that right but notice the world knoweth him not they don't see him they don't understand him they don't know the purpose that God has a man for them as far as they're concerned God is just a god of History amen he's not moving anymore he's not you know and so they have presented to the people a god of yesterday because they don't know him of today can you say amen and and they're looking they are now they're looking for a messiah they're they're looking for the promised one as the Jews did back then but what are they doing they're looking for him not in the word but in their Creeds and their traditions and their interpretations and their own understanding can you say Amen but when Jesus come that day it was just like it is today but he didn't come to fulfill their Creeds he didn't come to fulfill their traditions and their ideology he come to fulfill all righteousness which is the word of God can you say Amen now look in Romans 10 and 1 Paul wrote of Israel saying Brethren my heart's desire and prayer to God for Israel is that they might be saved for I bear them record that they have a Zeal of God but not according to knowledge now now that that's the same picture that the Gentile church is today the carnal Church the natural churches they have a Zeal for God Amen but not according to knowledge a man that got a zealed to save Souls but they passing out the donuts and and they're sending their preachers to to the seminaries and to get better educated and and and they they they've got to uh go to win souls and to fill the church up amen but they're leaning to psychology and they're leaning to technology and they're leaning to personality and all of these things amen see they have a Zeal of God but not according to knowledge for they being ignorant of God's righteousness see going about to establish their own righteousness have not submitted themselves unto the righteousness of God ain't that right so again they are ignorant a man of God's righteousness and hath not submitted to the the the righteousness of God now I you look up that word ignorant it means without understanding to to not know to not perceive or understand see that so so they've got a Zeal of God but they don't know how to fulfill it they they don't know the right path they don't know what God really expects of them can you say Amen well the prophet talked about it you know they're their their goal was back then a million more and 44 and I think that was the Baptist slogan and Pentecostals got their own slogan and this slogan and that slogan Azeal a man but not for but but ignorant of the righteousness of God see so the righteousness of God is not known to them so therefore they are without understanding now Jesus said except a man be born again he cannot see or understand the kingdom of God ain't that right amen now we're still talking about the paths of righteousness now he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness see we're we're not following our own way we're not stumbling in the dark we're we're we're we're we're not groping and trying and and all of these things ain't that right there is an understanding to the word of God Amen that the the bride that did not say it the bride does have a man it's here the understanding the spirit of Revelation the spirit of understanding is here can you say Amen it's here and so a man that walks blind blindly in the world today he does it well brother Brown said they're willfully ignorant that that that's just all you can say God has showed himself in such a way in this hour ain't that right now remember if if you look at it it took a prophet to introduce Christ to the world John the Baptist was that Prophet that may the introduction and he presented the church to Christ amen and and and he took a prophet and it took John a man to reveal Christ uh uh to to present Christ to the world it it just had that's just God's way amen see and and and a lot of people didn't understand it but nevertheless it was God's way but just as John was introduced the Messiah of the first coming of the Messiah so is it a man that that there there has been a prophet to introduce Christ again to this age ain't that right there has been we're not looking uh uh uh uh we're not looking for something uh uh but but we we're looking at it we we know that that God has sent a prophet in this age and what his ministry was Amen brother Brown said as John was sent to wind up the Old Testament and to bring forth the introduction of Christ a message will wind up the Loose Ends and will introduce the Messiah just before his coming the message of the last days ain't that right now I know people say well you know we need to get people to Christ price Christ if you don't see Christ in the message you're missing it amen for that's what the message was is to introduce Christ amen it was a personal and and and brother Branham uh understood that that he was to introduce Christ to the world today he realized that his message amen was was just as important as John the Baptist was back then and and and not only does brother Branham understand that we understand that or at least I hope you do amen now brother Brown said the Holy Spirit has been bound by these denominational Rivers for almost 2 000 years but is to be loosed in the evening time amen by the evening time message the Holy Spirit back in the church again ain't that right twice himself revealed in human flesh in the evening time amen another place he says the seventh seal brings him back to Earth again ain't that right amen now this is important because we find that when we see him amen what was he revealed as amen the son of man amen that's what Luke 17 30 told us that he when we see him he would be revealed as the son of man a man and he comes why does he come he comes to claim what he has redeemed aren't you glad for that he comes to receive what he has redeemed and we know what redeemed means it means to bring back to its original condition bring back amen what is it back to the word back to the original thoughts of God back to being the attribute of God back to the power of God back to being the manifestation of the sons of God that shouted and rejoiced before the foundation of the world can you say amen amen that's what he's come to do to redeem us back amen and oh I hope we get this really down into our soul a man of what this message is all about is to take us back to the word ain't that right you hear Brother Branham crying out back to the word back to the word back to the word what was he saying amen go back to the very Mind Of God Amen the way God thought of you before the foundation of the world Amen that's what he's come to redeem we were slave to the enemy we were slaved Amen to whatever trapped in sin trapped in denomination trapped in everything else amen but in this day it becometh us to fulfill all righteousness can you say amen amen not the order of the church not the not not not the order of some Bishop not some order of whatever but to come back and fulfill all righteousness well we didn't know what was in the was in the word the word was closed up to us amen we didn't understand what it was but it's in this day under that third pool Ministry that the word has been opened up to us and we begin to understand what the paths of righteousness really is it didn't have a beginning in a church our origin is in the mind of God can you say Amen your life ain't amen didn't start with God Amen at an altar you was always with God the prophet said you wasn't saved on any a given day you was always saved get back to that word get back not living not we're not trying to serve God as some slaves and and vagabonds and and all that there's been a Redemptive price made for us can you say amen amen we come into this world not even recognizing not even acting like sons of God we were acting like sons of the devil you understand what I'm saying we were Liars drunks and miserable creatures and all of these things having a carnal nature that was enmity against God but think of what David said he restoreth my soul he restores my soul he gave the something back to me amen where the devil can no longer claim me the devil can no longer boss me around and Lead me around God come to redeem my soul and he said he is South he is thrown in the soul of my heart can you say Amen why he gonna lead us in the paths of righteousness he's going to lead us back to where he re where we came from the uh uh in the first place back to where we fell from ain't that right so it took now it took now he's not in that now now you you all know that that the Bible never says that Jesus will come to the Earth amen and and put his feet upon the Earth Amen in a physical body before the rapture right see we're not off the wall we know what we're talking about and this is what brother Branham said so when he says he's coming back to bring him back to Earth amen now we know that the the seventh seal has a has a threefold purpose and and that seven seal involves the Millennium and it involves the new new Earth and it involves all that but I'm talking about right now amen that it brings Christ back to Earth again amen and where is it in a church in a in your body brother Bill in your body Faith that's in your body it brought Christ back into the church again Amen to fulfill amen the rest of his ministry he leads us in the paths of righteousness now notice as the first Forerunner came from the Wilderness and cried the Holy Lamb of God the second Forerunner will probably do the same by pointing the people to a word born bride right where's Christ in a word born bride where's messiah in a word born bride ain't that right go go go listen to the message brother Brandon preaching on Messiahs you're that anointed one The Works that I do shall you do even greater than thee shall you do ain't that right as the father has sent me so send I you brother Brown said how did the father send him he went with him that's right see so he sent us a man into this Earth by being in us a man see so he says now the second Forerunner will probably do the same thing and do the same by pointing the people to a word born bride the bride of Christ will be pointed to the skies at the peering of Jesus scream and Behold the Lamb of God will come forth from his lips ain't that riding so now how will the people know how will the people that's believing him know that it's the Messiah the prophet said unless they are constantly in the word to know what he is ain't that right amen we're not got our nose in the Creeds we're not God our knowledge all mixed up in all these uh the the the the the traditions of men and and all the Babbling and the backblatting and the fussing and the griping and all of that you'll never know him by that way you got to know him by having your your your your your your eyes upon the word of God Amen constantly in the word to know what he is amen and notice Daniel 11 and 2 32 it break it in it says the people that do know their God shall be strong and do exploits or great exploits who is it who's gonna do that the people that know their God and how will they know him except they're constantly in the word to know what he is ain't that right amen and how will they know him when they can't accept the prophet of this age they can't accept his ministry so how are they going to know him but there's a people that do know him and that have the understanding Daniel 12 and 10 breaking in none of the wicked shall understand but the wise shall understand ain't that right now I'm not going to keep you much longer but he says now how how shall he appear in these last days is to bring the people back to the word so that the bride will know her husband know her mate the revealed word ain't that right remember when he come to the Earth he said my meat is to do the will of the father the will of him that sent me and so is the is the heart of the Bride to do the will of him that sent sent her amen why she's flesh of his flesh bone of his bone so that there there is more relation between the the the the people of God the elect of God and and God in Christ than there is of just Flesh and Blood there's more relation can you say man you've got a greater relation a a greater lineage with Christ amen than you do which is just natural a family that's right see and so he appear in this last day to bring the people back to the word so that the bride will know her husband know her mate the revealed word that's why this has to happen ain't that right that's why this message had to be so that we would know who he is amen see it wasn't in the reformers was it in Luther Wesley in the Pentecostals and then scribcy and then the scripture says it wasn't but it will come and come that that is his promise for this age we're living in the age that his coming will be in she the bride must be identified in him any woman must be identified with her husband for the two are one and Christ's bride has to be identified with him for the two are one he is the word can you say that now he is the word not a denomination he is the word and we are to be the children of light and the light is the word which is made light for this age how do we know light except it comes from the word of God can you say man so we're not following traditions and saying we're walking in the paths of righteousness because there is no path that there is no righteousness in Traditions amen there is no righteousness increase there is no no righteousness in theology amen but we know that we're walking in the paths of righteousness because we see him as being the word can you say amen that's right the word made flesh is the light of the age he says when you see it and the Bible said so Hallelujah so he the spirit of Truth has come has loosed the seals the spirit of Truth is going to lead you and guide you so he ain't gonna lead you to some you know some Daddy and if you're you're in a dead end you've LED yourself there and God amen God leads us right in the paths of righteousness ain't that right the spirit of Truth come he's loose the seals and and and the and has revealed the Mysteries to us that we may know him now notice what first John 5 20 it says we know that the Son of God has come and hath given us an understanding that we may know him amen the word we may know him I'm gonna put it this way the revealed word why why because that's where we're at today David had a portion of him through the revelation all the way down the prophets but then he became the word made flesh every prophecy that was spoke was made flesh right then and church we ain't got no more other age we are at the climax of this Gentile dispensation amen there is no other bride to come you're that bride there is no other woman to take on his name but you can you say amen amen everything that he has longed for in his heart from the foundation of the world this is it amen I know it doesn't look like much I understand that you may not feel like much but honey you are the you are the apple of his eye you you are you are everything that he died for you are everything that he lived for amen you are everything that he fulfilled amen the word for it's for you can you say man God came down and joined one with man to bring a Redemption that he could come into you and have Fellowship amen so here we are no even though you feel insignificant and even though you may be going to the greatest battles of your life and you don't feel like you're ever going to make it there is a word concerning you that must be fulfilled and he is going to fulfill it through you it's the same God it's the same Divine Purpose it's the Eternal purpose of God that cannot fail I don't care oh I hope you understand that your trial can annul it your doubt can't annull it your discouragement can and all it if God has ordained you for this age to fulfill the word you're going to fulfill it it becomes us so we're not just sitting around here twiddling our thumbs notice what he says we know that the Son of God has come and hath given us an understanding that we may know him that is true aren't you glad you're not you don't you're not sitting in a church that that you have just a figment of imagination of who he is think of that he's come and given us an understanding that we may know him that is true you believe he's true if you go read the church age book brother Brown talks about the true and the uh the realities [Music] of God which is the true bread what they had back then partial did he call that partial partial realization all the Old Testament had partial realization why because they were speaking of something to come that natural lamb that Abel offered up was just partial realization but he was the true he Jesus said I'm the true bread what was he saying well there was the bread that come down from heaven and manna that was the partial realization but it was only talking of him and when he come he says I am that true bread so we could look at he was the true lamb he was the true bread he was the true high priest he was the true Mercy Seat he was the true altar everything was realized in him and so is it today we ain't got just partial we ain't serving God through a partial realization we are that realization we are the realization Ruth was the the partial realization we are that realization we are the true amen can you say Amen he's given us an understanding that we may know him that is true and we are in him that is true even in his son Jesus Christ and this is the true God and eternal life amen so he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness every person every person that is a part of this bride has this same testimony that God has led them to this message God has now you say well I was raised in it so I was always been no no that's not true how many people have been raised in this message and don't believe it or that just sit in a church and it just never Dawns on them the light bulb don't come on for them God has to lead you to this message whether you're born born in a message Church raised in a message church or just come off Skid Row God had to lead you to the message ain't that right and so we can say and and I can say I know you can I am what I am by the grace of God ain't that right and so in our natural birth we did not start out the way God intended us to be we were liars cheaters and had a carnal nature that defied the very word of God we all had dreams and Ambitions that came from the carnal nature and yet we may have even had a desire to serve God but it would come from a carnal nature a carnal mind hey like brother Brown said the nuns don't go to none read to be bad there's something in them wanting to be right but they're serving it they're doing it through carnal nature carnal understanding carnal things talking to an individual today and saying oh my says I've I've been everywhere and people just kind of kind of may be questioning me uh uh but said you know says I I went to a Baptist for a little bit I went to this denomination for a little bit and I gave my all for it you know I was teaching Sunday school I was this I was that I I was doing everything I got discontent with that so I went to this other denomination and I put them all into it and and I I I I left that one and something still and so I went somewhere else and put my all into it you know and then says I come to the message and I'm satisfied and and says you know it seemed like I was so Rocky and so unstable and that maybe people just saying well we'll just see how this goes you know and and but I was telling them you know but but the the the thing the difference is that you couldn't be satisfied in that because that was just that that was man-made that God was leading you and and we all can uh well most of us I guess all of us can can say that God's been leading us God God has led us to the message I come out of the Pentecostal uh uh uh back background and and all that and and and to think where I am today from what I used to be I have to say God led me you understand what I'm saying and and so why because we have a purpose and we couldn't find our purpose outside this message hello we couldn't find the purpose outside this message we didn't know that we were part of the body of Christ not not in the way no traditionally we could say that but not in the way that the Bible says it and you say man and and so therefore you know uh um we're here today A man walking in the paths of righteousness because he has led us and he is continuing to lead now now notice Proverbs 16 and 9 a man's heart deviseth his way but the Lord directeth his steps now have you have you been there and God God so arrested you God's got so apprehended us to where he could lead us in in this in the paths of righteousness that this isn't our determined will that we have nothing to do with it except yielding to him can you say man and and then even Paul said this he he declared himself to be the prisoner of Christ and is this not what we are prisoners of Christ because he's leading us contrary to our own will he's he's leading us contrary to our own ambitions he's actually changed his 360 degrees why because the Lord directeth his steps Psalms 37 23 the steps of a good man or a righteous man or ordered of the Lord and he delighteth in his way and and and I looked at that word ordered it means established so that the steps of righteous man are established by the Lord ain't that right now when were the steps of the righteous established before the foundation of the world look at this judge God said to Jeremiah and Jeremiah 1 5 before I formed thee in the belly I knew thee and before thou camest forth out of the womb I Sanctified thee and I ordained thee a prophet unto the Nations when did he do that before uh uh before uh Jeremiah was even formed in the womb before the foundation of the world so these paths that were walking has been ordained before the foundation of the world our steps are ordered by the Lord look at this Romans 8 30 it says Lord over whom he did predestinate them he also called whom he called them he also Justified whom he justified them he also glorified Ephesians 1 3 according as he hath chosen Us in him before the foundational world that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love how in the world could we walk these paths without him leading us Jeremiah 10 23 says oh Lord I know the way of man is not in himself it is not in man that walketh to direct his steps it's not in men it's not in him to choose his own ways it's God's if we could understand that this evening before we close but to understand that that our steps were ordered by God these Paths of righteousness was it come from the heart of God [Music] 's purpose God's Divine will and then he would choose us to walk these paths how can you fail how can you lose Philippians 2 and 13 says for it is God which worketh in you both too will and to do according of his good pleasure James 1 18 it says of his own will beget he us with the word of Truth he begat us with the revealed word that we should be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures creation so notice that of his own will everybody say of his own will he begat us of his own will he began us there is no other reason that he begot you outside of his own will nothing his dealings with you is purely divine it's it it purely comes from his heart his love for you is not is not influenced from anything outside of him it's all coming from from him to you right so so he chose you he beget you of his own will and there was no external influence to cause him to do it his will determine the matter therefore you're saved therefore you're secure therefore these Paths of righteousness that you're walking on was divinely ordered for you and you say man I thought of this this phrase he began us which means bring forth he brings us he to bring forth just like James 1 and 15 it says sin bringeth forth death sin is the beginning the start the calls and death comes from it he of his own will beget us by the word of Truth didn't you say Amen so see the word of Truth didn't just bring us as a creation see he didn't just bring us forth as a creation but the word of Truth is the seed or germ of life that brought us forth you understand it's not just that God says okay I'm going to create sister Bethany push and there you are then you're left to your own devices and you're just like well okay I'm a creation of God by his spoken word but you were begat by the word of Truth showing that the word of Truth was the seed it was your origin and that word of Truth goes all the way back to the mind of God it's an eternal word an eternal purpose and we didn't come expressing that at all but he redeemed us that he could bring us back to what he began us from back to our origin can you say man and this is the Prophet this was the whole purpose of the prophet of this day it's not just to take us like Moses all the way to the beginning but he took us beyond the beginning he took us not just to Creation in the Garden of Eden but he took us all the way in the mind of God and said you were there in the beginning and you never did it in the first place he's showing our origin and it was all by the Divine will of God now here we are in in in our mortal beings here we are with all the the human element and yet we we have to look at it that we're walking in Paths of righteousness that is impossible to walk by man himself because we would have never chose these paths but he chose them he ordered our steps and he's the one that leads us we have such a hope such a hope can you say Amen if the musicians will come Psalms 40 and 2 he brought me up also out of an horrible pit out of the Myra clay and set my feet up on a rock and established my Goings speaking in the sense of going someplace going forward moving taking steps he's established my steps in other words and I like here Psalms 119 133 it says order or establish my steps in thy can you say man so God has his word set in all ages and the prophet said his foreknowledge has caused him to set in the church and in the people certain things that he did from the beginning and then the gospel that's being preached to that age is only revealed to that certain people and the rest of them don't see it that's predestination and that's what Jesus said he said father I thank thee that thou has hid these things from the wise and the Prudence but has revealed them unto babes as would learn ain't that right and so we we know what the prophet said about it he didn't choose his predestination didn't didn't well I'm going to choose this one and not choose this one amen but he already knew he had an infinite mind and and so him being infinite he knew every flee that would be on the earth he knew how many times each flea would back their eye he knew how much Tallow or fat that each flea would have he knew every blade of grass that each flea would set upon that's the infinite mind and the Bible talks about Christ being slain before the foundation of the world ain't that right and then the prophet asked when was he slain before the foundation of the world when was this and he says way back in the beginning when he first thought of this redeemed body see you were already thought of in the mind of God now here you are walking in the very steps and the Very paths that God ordered for you Hallelujah young people you can't lose you can't go down steps have already been ordered by God amen that's why you didn't stumble getting the Holy Ghost you didn't stumble into this message you didn't stumble at the altar you just didn't stumble into these things he had been leading you all along leading you all along can you say man how many times has the devil tried to stop it I thought of Jesus's life here he's made that declaration it becometh us to feel all righteousness and yet as he's on his way to fulfill all righteousness on that boat the devil stares up a storm stares up the winds trying to get them waves to sink that boat trying to stop the purpose of God Jesus having God within him he was God could stand up on the bow of that ship speak to the storms peace be still and the winds and the waves obeyed their master but then we see that same God in a redeemed body there on the mountain where Colorado or New York or wherever that was when the snowstorm was coming the blizzard was there amen and the same God spoke to that storm and it caused it stopped it ain't that right now church I just believe that if you're ordered of God if you've got a path that you've got to walk I don't care how many Devils try to sink your ship you have every right to stand on that bow of that ship and say peace be still peace be still Satan you can't take me down Satan you can't destroy Satan you have no hold on me I'm here to fulfill the righteousness of God I'm here he's leading me in these Paths of righteousness I have an understanding of what I am to do you love him amen God bless you what song [Music]
