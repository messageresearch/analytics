[49:07] Lord Of Our Lives meaning that we have
[49:12] surrendered ourselves Lord we don't
[49:15] invite you just to come to just in us
[49:18] for one part but we have opened all of
[49:21] our doors of the Heart Lord and asked
[49:24] you to make your yourself at home and

[49:29] just come and move among us today Lord

[49:38] now more than ever and father I pray

[49:46] and may we just be acceptant to your

[50:12] forgive us Lord may we be better
[50:15] Christians Lord more like you we ask it
[50:19] father in Jesus Christ's name and the
[50:21] church says amen amen and amen
[50:26] uh the book of Ephesians the fourth
[50:30] chapter and we'll start at the the first
[50:35] verse I therefore the prisoner of the
[50:38] Lord beseech you that you walk worthy of
[50:42] the vocation wherewith you are
[50:44] called with all loneliness and meekness
[50:48] with longsuffering forbearing one
[50:50] another in love endeavoring to keep the
[50:52] unity of the spirit in the bond of peace
[50:56] there is one body and one Spirit even as
[51:00] you are called in one hope of your
[51:03] calling amen then if you'll turn to 1
[51:07] Corinthians the 12th
[51:10] chapter amen 1 Corinthians chapter
[51:19] 12 and going to start at the 12th
[51:24] verse
[51:27] but it says uh for as the body is one
[51:31] and hath many members and all the
[51:33] members of that one body being many are
[51:37] one body so also is Christ for by one
[51:41] Spirit we are all baptized into one body
[51:43] whether we be Jews or Gentiles whether
[51:45] we be Bond or
[51:47] free and have been all made to drink
[51:50] into one spirit for the body is not one
[51:53] member but many
[51:55] yet the foot shall say because I am not
[51:57] the
[51:59] hand uh I am not of the body is it
[52:03] therefore not of the body if the ear
[52:06] shall say well because I am not the eye
[52:09] I am not of the body is it therefore not
[52:11] of the body if the whole body were an
[52:14] eye where would the hearing if the whole
[52:18] were hearing where were the
[52:22] smelling but now hath God said the
[52:25] members
[52:27] everyone of them in the body as it hath
[52:32] pleased him amen aren't you glad for
[52:35] that then uh if you go the 23rd verse
[52:40] and those members of the body which we
[52:42] think to be less honorable upon these we
[52:45] bestow more abundant honor and our
[52:48] uncomely parts have more abundant cless
[52:52] for our comely Parts have no need but
[52:55] God hath tempered the body together
[52:58] having given more abundant honor to that
[53:00] part which is which lacked that there
[53:03] should be no Schism in the body but that
[53:06] the members should have the same care
[53:08] one for another and whether one member
[53:12] suffer all the members suffer with it or
[53:15] one member be honored all members
[53:18] Rejoice with it now you are the body of
[53:21] Christ and members in particular amen
[53:26] you can uh have your seats this
[53:30] morning again I want
[53:33] to speak on the ministry of God in the
[53:36] body of Christ and um of course as we've
[53:41] said it is the
[53:43] um um God's Ministry working through the
[53:47] members of his own body to fulfill his
[53:51] will yeah and this this plan
[53:56] purpose God's will was formulated before
[53:59] the foundation of the world but it's in
[54:02] this age that he is finishing it
[54:05] up uh bringing it to pass sir we are not
[54:10] in the beginning
[54:11] stages of of God's will we are rather in
[54:17] the completion amen and the prophet said
[54:21] that God is taking the elect out of that
[54:23] Pentecostal church that high hybrid
[54:26] pulling it out and finishing up the
[54:29] word and it's got to be so close until
[54:32] the word itself will blend with this
[54:34] word see there there Comes The Headstone
[54:38] crying Grace Grace Amazing Grace The
[54:41] Headstone now as we all I'm sure have
[54:45] heard the sermon Christ is the mystery
[54:47] of God revealed and if you haven't you
[54:49] ought to go listen to it but brother
[54:51] brandham tells us that there is a a
[54:53] three-fold minut mystery that God had uh
[54:57] uh before the world began and uh that
[55:02] first part of the three-fold is to
[55:06] express himself completely in Jesus
[55:09] Christ God in Christ reconciling the
[55:13] world to
[55:14] himself secondly is to have the
[55:17] preeminence by this by God being in
[55:21] Christ the work that he had
[55:23] done that was the purpose purpose and
[55:25] and and he couldn't move on into the
[55:27] second phase of that until he had
[55:30] finished the first but by that then God
[55:34] is to have the preeminence in his church
[55:38] which is his body the bride see till he
[55:41] could have the preeminence to express
[55:44] himself through them Satan has tried to
[55:48] express himself and every other thing uh
[55:52] in the church but God had
[55:55] uh uh desired to express himself in the
[56:00] church and in order for him and it's his
[56:03] church and he in order for him to do
[56:05] that he's got to have the preeminence
[56:08] the third part is to restore the kingdom
[56:10] to its rightly position that failed by
[56:12] sin by the first adom back to where he
[56:15] walked in the cool of the evened E
[56:18] evening with his people talk with them
[56:20] fellowship with them amen so brother
[56:23] randam he he go in another place he said
[56:26] see first to manifest himself in Jesus
[56:29] Christ secondly to come into the body by
[56:34] Jesus Christ to have the
[56:36] preeminence thirdly to what restore back
[56:39] Eden bring back that which was lost
[56:44] ain't that right so the first fold
[56:47] Myster of of the mystery has been
[56:49] fulfilled and and and and we can all
[56:52] agree to that the the the world talks
[56:55] about it uh uh this is the season that
[56:59] that uh the world uh uh recreates the
[57:04] the baby in a manger scene talks about
[57:07] the God of History 2,000 years ago we
[57:11] have our Easter and and and they redo
[57:14] the you know they have their Easter
[57:16] pageants plays and things like that and
[57:19] so so we can all say that that part of
[57:22] that mystery has been fulfilled
[57:25] God in Christ reconciling the world
[57:28] Jesus said my meat is to do the will of
[57:30] the father and and and another place he
[57:33] said it is the father in me that doeth
[57:36] the works amen uh uh they they it was
[57:40] Philip that said it would it would
[57:41] suffice us if you would show us who the
[57:43] father is show us the Father and Jesus
[57:46] said have I not been have I been so long
[57:48] with you and you still don't know who I
[57:50] am he that has seen me has seen the
[57:52] father and so God in Christ expressed
[57:56] himself in fullness amen uh uh through
[58:00] throughout the the prophets and things
[58:03] he was able to express himself in part
[58:06] but in when it come to Christ he was
[58:08] able to express himself in fullness so
[58:11] then think of the day that we are living
[58:13] in brother B said we're living in one of
[58:16] the grandest ages that that ever uh man
[58:20] has been permitted to live Amen to think
[58:23] of that you've been permitted to live in
[58:25] the greatest age ever he said and that's
[58:28] because it's the closing out of time and
[58:31] the blending in of Eternity so this it
[58:35] tells you exactly where we're at and
[58:38] where God is in his plan and three-fold
[58:42] purpose uh because see if this is true
[58:45] if we are truly living in the the
[58:49] grandest age of of the ending of time
[58:52] the blending of Eternity which we
[58:54] believe it is true uh then that means
[58:57] that God has been able to call a people
[59:00] amen out of the Gentiles for his name
[59:04] amen and and now he's been able to have
[59:07] the preeminence over them and in them
[59:10] God able to achieve that second fold uh
[59:15] uh part of his mystery and that was to
[59:18] have the preeminence in his people amen
[59:21] and because of that now we're entering
[59:24] into that other phase of of of of time
[59:28] stopping and we're going into eternity I
[59:31] think that is powerful to to be able to
[59:34] be a part of that amen that God didn't
[59:37] choose us in Luther and and and and that
[59:40] wasn't the grandest age he didn't he
[59:42] didn't choose us to be part of Wesley or
[59:44] the Pentecostal age that was not the
[59:46] blending but we're now in that time of
[59:51] time
[59:52] ending eternity blending ain't that
[59:55] right so so uh uh this again is a sign
[59:59] that God has been able to have the
[1:00:01] preeminence in his church he has been
[1:00:04] able now think of it God has been able
[1:00:07] by you and by me has been able to prove
[1:00:11] to the devil that there are a people
[1:00:14] that will not bow there are a people
[1:00:17] that will not give in there are a people
[1:00:20] on this Earth that that will not be
[1:00:22] deceived um and and and uh uh he was
[1:00:26] able to deceive Eve in the infant stage
[1:00:29] of deception but we're living in the
[1:00:32] greatest the the the best deception that
[1:00:35] could ever be known to man uh uh we're
[1:00:38] living here we're living in the age but
[1:00:41] and the whole world will be deceived
[1:00:43] everyone will wander after the beast
[1:00:46] that's what the prophet said that's what
[1:00:47] the Bible says and and the prophet says
[1:00:50] the only ones that will not wander after
[1:00:52] that Beast will be those that were
[1:00:55] predestinated uh before the foundation
[1:00:57] of the world that'll be part of the
[1:00:58] bride of Christ amen see so so there
[1:01:03] there is a people that Satan just will
[1:01:05] not be able to influence because God has
[1:01:09] able to have preeminence in that group
[1:01:12] of people well this people is makes up
[1:01:15] his church his body they have been
[1:01:18] baptized into that one body by one
[1:01:20] Spirit God's church is not Faith
[1:01:23] Tabernacle it is not evening Life
[1:01:26] Tabernacle uh or light Tabernacle it's
[1:01:29] not true word Tabernacle it's not Full
[1:01:31] Gospel Light House it's not spoken word
[1:01:34] Tabernacle amen as good of titles and
[1:01:37] good of names and and good churches and
[1:01:40] and all of that but that's not the body
[1:01:42] of Christ that's not the Church of
[1:01:43] Christ and and and so no doubt that God
[1:01:47] has people in every in in these churches
[1:01:50] uh uh you know uh who are part of his
[1:01:53] church which is his body and and it's
[1:01:57] them people that God is able to have the
[1:02:00] preeminence over and in and through amen
[1:02:04] and so uh uh therefore you know see God
[1:02:08] is the word Amen brother brandham has
[1:02:10] has established that over and over and
[1:02:13] over the Bible tells us that God is the
[1:02:16] word so there for that revealed word and
[1:02:21] and brother bran really makes that known
[1:02:23] that when it's the word made manifest
[1:02:25] that's God that's Christ and and so
[1:02:28] therefore the revealed word is what has
[1:02:32] the preeminence over that elect people
[1:02:35] and the word comes to the prophets amen
[1:02:40] I am so glad for that Revelation to know
[1:02:42] that it does not come to psychologists
[1:02:45] it does not come to to to theologians it
[1:02:48] does not come just to the you know to
[1:02:51] the pope it doesn't come to the bishop
[1:02:53] Cardinal uh denomination it came to a
[1:02:56] prophet ain't that right so then we we
[1:02:59] know by God's grace and it is God's
[1:03:02] grace that we can truly believe that we
[1:03:04] have had a Vindicated prophet in this
[1:03:08] age which is not just a prophet gu
[1:03:11] saying I'm a prophet I'm there's a lot
[1:03:13] of people that's claiming to be prophets
[1:03:15] uh well in and outside the message ranks
[1:03:18] you know and and and they claim but we
[1:03:21] this Prophet is is a Malachi 4 Prophet
[1:03:24] it's a word Prophet amen and and and so
[1:03:28] uh you know uh uh as the Gentile bride
[1:03:31] of Christ we are not looking for another
[1:03:35] Prophet amen we don't need another
[1:03:39] Prophet to come we're not looking for
[1:03:41] another Prophet God has never promised
[1:03:45] to send us another Prophet outside of
[1:03:48] Malachi 4 amen so how many satisfied
[1:03:51] with the prophet of Malachi 4 well I'm
[1:03:53] satisfied
[1:03:54] see amen we're so we're not looking amen
[1:03:57] so that that takes the gullibleness out
[1:04:00] that takes the vulnerability or whatever
[1:04:02] you would want to call it when people
[1:04:04] say well I'm a prophet and this is a
[1:04:05] prophet and this is the Eighth Day and
[1:04:07] or eighth messenger and all that who
[1:04:09] cares I don't I don't I don't care you
[1:04:11] know uh uh let them let them whatever
[1:04:14] you know and and uh uh but I I I don't
[1:04:18] understand why people feel the need to
[1:04:20] keep in introducing another Prophet we
[1:04:22] don't need another prophet amen amen we
[1:04:25] we just don't need it and and and I'll
[1:04:27] be the first you know I'll be uh bold
[1:04:29] enough to declare that I don't need
[1:04:31] Brother Joseph brandham to be my Prophet
[1:04:34] uh I I just don't he don't need to tell
[1:04:36] me how to run my life and run the church
[1:04:38] and what I need to do amen God sent a
[1:04:41] prophet of Malachi 4 and that's good
[1:04:44] enough for me he he never promised now
[1:04:47] after I send you the prophet of Malachi
[1:04:49] 4 then I'm going to send you another
[1:04:51] Prophet it it never was that way and so
[1:04:54] uh uh and not to say that God doesn't
[1:04:56] have prophets on the earth and and and
[1:04:59] and I don't dispute that and if God has
[1:05:01] that then that's fine but God sent me a
[1:05:04] prophet of Malachi 4 and we understand
[1:05:07] his ministry brother Brandon plainly
[1:05:10] tied prophet of Malachi 4 with uh
[1:05:13] Revelations uh uh uh 10:7 the seventh
[1:05:16] angel amen so there is no other Prophet
[1:05:18] that's going to reveal the Mysteries no
[1:05:21] other Prophet going to reveal Mysteries
[1:05:22] ain't that right and and so uh uh but
[1:05:26] but they they they want to keep
[1:05:27] introducing and so they just don't seem
[1:05:30] to be satisfied with the prophet God
[1:05:32] sent to this generation and and they're
[1:05:35] not satisfied with what God Vindicated
[1:05:38] over and over and over to be the truth
[1:05:40] ain't that right so but but but if this
[1:05:43] word if the word is actually able to
[1:05:46] have the preeminence over you then you
[1:05:49] will not look for anything else outside
[1:05:52] of the will of God outside of the the
[1:05:54] word of God and outside of what God has
[1:05:57] promised in this age we know that the
[1:06:00] leodys of messenger is the last
[1:06:04] messenger it's the last messenger and
[1:06:07] notice what brother Brown said the last
[1:06:09] day Messenger will appear in God's
[1:06:12] appointed time it is the end time now as
[1:06:15] all know for Israel is in the Homeland
[1:06:18] any time now uh he will come according
[1:06:22] to Malachi see when we see him he will
[1:06:25] be dedicated to the word aren't you glad
[1:06:28] we had a prophet dedicated to the word
[1:06:30] amen he will be indicated pointed out in
[1:06:33] the word revelation 10:7 and God will
[1:06:36] vindicate his ministry he will preach
[1:06:39] the truth as did Elijah and be ready for
[1:06:43] the Mount Zion
[1:06:44] Showdown many will misunderstand him not
[1:06:49] because of him but because they have
[1:06:53] been taught
[1:06:54] scripture in a certain way which they
[1:06:58] consider true so when he comes against
[1:07:01] that they will not believe see even some
[1:07:05] true ministers will misunderstand the
[1:07:08] messenger because so much has been
[1:07:10] called God's truth by
[1:07:13] deceivers amen see but this Prophet will
[1:07:17] come and as the uh Forerunner of the
[1:07:20] first coming cried Behold the Lamb of
[1:07:22] God that taketh away the sin of the
[1:07:23] world
[1:07:24] even so he will no doubt cry out Behold
[1:07:27] the Lamb of God coming in glory he will
[1:07:29] do this for even as John was the
[1:07:32] messenger of Truth to the elect so is
[1:07:36] this one the last Messenger to the elect
[1:07:39] and word born bride amen see so so uh uh
[1:07:45] uh we we thank God for a messenger we
[1:07:48] thank God that we're able to believe and
[1:07:50] see it now then brother brandham says
[1:07:53] and notice
[1:07:54] listen to the authenticated prophet of
[1:07:58] God who appears in this last age what he
[1:08:03] says from God the bride will
[1:08:06] say can you say Amen what he says from
[1:08:10] God the bride will say the spirit and
[1:08:13] the prophet and the bride will be saying
[1:08:17] the same thing oh that's that people
[1:08:21] that God has been able to have
[1:08:23] preeminence over the spirit the prophet
[1:08:26] and the bride will be saying the same
[1:08:29] thing and what they say will have
[1:08:32] already been said in the word but the
[1:08:35] people won't know it they won't believe
[1:08:38] it because they've been taught
[1:08:39] scripturally wrong Doctrine see they've
[1:08:42] been taught this and have accepted it as
[1:08:45] the truth but there is a people that God
[1:08:48] has opened their eyes and been able to
[1:08:50] have the preeminence that they are so
[1:08:52] sold out on what that Prophet said ain't
[1:08:55] that right amen you know why people need
[1:08:58] another Prophet is cuz they can't
[1:08:59] believe the prophet God sent so they
[1:09:02] need something else to Amen to try to
[1:09:04] fix it but every answer that you need
[1:09:07] the prophet brought it's in this message
[1:09:11] if you can just believe it amen that's
[1:09:14] right so notice now the prophet said
[1:09:17] notice what Harmony Jesus never did
[1:09:19] anything until seing of the father or
[1:09:22] the father first showed him Harmony
[1:09:25] Harmony between God and Christ see
[1:09:27] Harmony see John 5:19 says that see so
[1:09:32] so will the bride so will the bride amen
[1:09:35] see it was God in Christ and and there
[1:09:38] was such Harmony that Jesus never done
[1:09:40] nothing except the father first showed
[1:09:42] him so will the bride see uh uh he says
[1:09:47] and he shows her his word has he not
[1:09:51] done that did he not show us his word by
[1:09:53] a prophet in this age he shows her his
[1:09:57] word of life he shows her and she
[1:10:02] receives it see she never everybody say
[1:10:05] she never she never doubts it amen you
[1:10:09] going through trial but she'll never
[1:10:11] doubt it she goes through ups and downs
[1:10:13] but she never doubts it she's tempted
[1:10:16] but she never doubts it she may fall but
[1:10:18] she gets up and she never doubts it amen
[1:10:22] there's something about this ride that
[1:10:24] God is able to have such preeminence she
[1:10:27] never doubts it notice nothing can harm
[1:10:30] her you go through hell or high water
[1:10:33] but nothing will harm you amen you go
[1:10:36] through the deepest of Trials but
[1:10:38] nothing will harm you amen let Satan do
[1:10:41] whatever he wants to and God will allow
[1:10:44] it sometimes but nothing nothing will
[1:10:48] take that Faith away from her nothing
[1:10:50] will get her to deny God and curse God
[1:10:53] nothing will amen see nothing she never
[1:10:57] doubts it nothing can harm her not even
[1:10:59] death for if the seed be planted the
[1:11:02] water will raise it up again he said I
[1:11:04] got a great big Hallelujah here is the
[1:11:07] secret here's the secret the word
[1:11:09] everybody say the word is in the bride
[1:11:13] the word is in the bride there's a
[1:11:16] people here this morning that the word
[1:11:17] is already found root in the word is in
[1:11:21] the bride see and the mind of Christ see
[1:11:25] to know what he wants done with that
[1:11:28] word now we're they're talking about
[1:11:30] Ministry in the bride see amen see the
[1:11:33] word is in the bride and the mind of
[1:11:37] Christ to know what he wants done with
[1:11:39] the word she does it in his name she has
[1:11:43] thus sayith the
[1:11:45] Lord she has thus sayith the Lord each
[1:11:48] member of the body has thus sayith the
[1:11:50] Lord do you believe that each member of
[1:11:53] the body body has thus sayth the Lord
[1:11:55] each member of the body knows what he
[1:11:57] wants done uh uh with the word and they
[1:12:00] do it each member in the body they do
[1:12:02] only his will and they do it in his name
[1:12:05] ain't that right see so then the this
[1:12:08] bride body is so different from what
[1:12:12] Jesus talked about uh uh uh uh
[1:12:17] uh that group of people that Jesus spoke
[1:12:19] of in Matthew 7:21 uh through 23 uh uh
[1:12:24] see not not everyone that saith unto me
[1:12:26] Lord Lord shall enter into the kingdom
[1:12:28] of heaven but he that doeth the will of
[1:12:29] My Father which is in heaven many will
[1:12:32] say to me in that day Lord Lord have we
[1:12:34] not prophesied in thy name and in thy
[1:12:37] name cast out devils and in thy name
[1:12:40] done many wonderful Works see then I
[1:12:42] will profess unto them I never knew you
[1:12:44] depart from me ye that work iniquity
[1:12:47] ain't that right see they did things in
[1:12:49] his name but they did not do his will
[1:12:52] they did things things in his name but
[1:12:54] he did not have the preeminence over
[1:12:56] them so how different from the bride
[1:12:59] from these these people amen the bride
[1:13:02] has he's been able to accomplish that
[1:13:05] that that second fold of his purpose and
[1:13:08] that was to have complete preeminence
[1:13:10] over them and what they do in his name
[1:13:13] will count because they're doing it
[1:13:15] according to his will
[1:13:18] amen it's a Ministry that fulfills the
[1:13:21] will of
[1:13:22] God that's all right so the this group
[1:13:25] of people that Jesus talks about doing
[1:13:28] it in his name and then in the end he
[1:13:30] says depart for me you workers of
[1:13:32] iniquity I never knew you see well they
[1:13:35] did things in his name but they didn't
[1:13:36] do the will of the father go go listen
[1:13:39] to that uh sermon uh brother Brandon
[1:13:42] doing God a service without being his
[1:13:44] will they did God a
[1:13:47] service but it wasn't his
[1:13:50] will ain't that right so then that tells
[1:13:53] us that the ministry that this bride has
[1:13:56] will be according to the will of God it
[1:13:58] it's in line with the will of God it
[1:14:00] isn't just out preaching it isn't just
[1:14:02] out singing it isn't just out
[1:14:04] prophesying speaking in tongues and all
[1:14:05] that it's all right into the will of God
[1:14:08] God has preeminence over the music God
[1:14:11] has preeminence over the preaching God
[1:14:12] has preeminence over the the husband God
[1:14:14] has preeminence over that housewife God
[1:14:17] has preeminence over the marriage God
[1:14:18] has preeminence over the local body God
[1:14:21] has the preeminence over every aspect he
[1:14:23] has the preeminence over the tongues he
[1:14:25] has the preeminence over the prophecy he
[1:14:27] has the preeminence over the Visions he
[1:14:29] has preeminence over the teaching he has
[1:14:31] preeminence over it
[1:14:33] all it isn't just a group of people
[1:14:35] doing something that they want to do for
[1:14:37] God God has the
[1:14:41] prance amen amen praise the
[1:14:44] Lord they did a service unto him without
[1:14:46] it being his will but notice again what
[1:14:49] the prophet said the word everybody say
[1:14:50] the word is where in the bride and the
[1:14:55] mind of Christ to know what he wants
[1:14:57] done with the word everybody's got a
[1:14:59] Ministry but there's only one group that
[1:15:01] knows what he wants done with the
[1:15:04] word and she does it in his name she's
[1:15:06] the one that has thus sayith the Lord
[1:15:09] amen praise the Lord so now we're coming
[1:15:12] to the reality of what Jesus said in
[1:15:14] Mark
[1:15:15] 11:23 verily verily I say unto you that
[1:15:19] whosoever shall say unto this mountain
[1:15:21] well now we know who that one is the one
[1:15:23] that's going to say it the bride she has
[1:15:27] thus sayith the Lord ain't that right
[1:15:30] that's right see that whosoever shall
[1:15:32] say unto this mountain be thou removed
[1:15:34] and be thou cast into the sea and shall
[1:15:36] not doubt in his heart but shall believe
[1:15:39] that those things which he say shall
[1:15:40] come to pass he shall have everybody say
[1:15:42] he shall have shall now let's let's make
[1:15:44] that personal I shall have I shall I
[1:15:46] shall have what soever things I say Amen
[1:15:50] why because you're part of the body you
[1:15:53] you have thus sayth the Lord you have
[1:15:55] the mind of Christ you know what he
[1:15:57] wants done with the
[1:15:59] word ain't that right see so he's
[1:16:02] speaking to no one else but the bride of
[1:16:04] Christ the Lord she can say it because
[1:16:08] the word is in her right she has the
[1:16:11] mind of Christ she know knows what he
[1:16:13] wants done with the word she has thus
[1:16:14] sayth the Lord see and and what gives
[1:16:17] her this Authority we go back she the
[1:16:22] prophet and the spirit are saying the
[1:16:25] same
[1:16:28] thing ain't that right so this shows
[1:16:32] that not only God was able to have
[1:16:34] preeminence in that Prophet he's now
[1:16:37] able to have preeminence over
[1:16:39] you the same spirit that spoke through
[1:16:42] the lips of that Prophet now has the
[1:16:43] preeminence to speak through you and
[1:16:45] what you say will be not in contrary to
[1:16:47] what a prophet says and what that
[1:16:49] Prophet taught was nothing contrary to
[1:16:52] this a that right people don't
[1:16:54] understand this at all they they look at
[1:16:57] it as literal they they take everything
[1:16:59] literally well it says it right here
[1:17:01] black and white right right here and
[1:17:03] that that's true it says it but then the
[1:17:05] prophet tells us to read between the
[1:17:07] lines get under an
[1:17:10] inspiration carnal people can't
[1:17:12] understand this even though they can
[1:17:14] read it with their own natural eyes they
[1:17:16] cannot understand
[1:17:19] this it's
[1:17:21] true so
[1:17:24] we find now now notice God has showed
[1:17:27] his word to her by way of a prophet and
[1:17:31] she has received it and never doubts it
[1:17:36] this is exactly what happened and this
[1:17:38] is our part in Revelations in the Book
[1:17:41] of Revelations in the fifth chapter we
[1:17:44] we know we're very familiar with it that
[1:17:47] John saw the lamb come forth and take
[1:17:50] the book lord it was a seven sealed book
[1:17:53] it was the book of redemption it's not
[1:17:56] just any book it's not tgj
[1:17:59] book it's it's it's not Dobson's
[1:18:03] book it's it's and and I I'll even say
[1:18:06] it it's not brother bram's book it's
[1:18:09] it's no no man's book this is God's
[1:18:14] book prise The Lord ain't that right and
[1:18:18] so John sees that the lamb come forth
[1:18:21] and loose the seals and open the look in
[1:18:23] the 10th chapter the first verse we see
[1:18:26] the mighty Angel which Christ it it it
[1:18:29] could only be right that's what a
[1:18:30] prophet said as the rainbow Covenant
[1:18:33] right uh uh he's the Covenant one the
[1:18:35] mighty Angel comes down with an open
[1:18:38] book he did not come without a book he
[1:18:42] had a book it was opened ain't that
[1:18:45] right see and and and then the prophet
[1:18:49] says see it's all connected that the
[1:18:51] seventh angel would be on the earth at
[1:18:53] the same time of this coming ain't that
[1:18:56] right because the word did not come to a
[1:18:58] pope it did not come to a bishop it did
[1:19:01] not come to to Shawn Martin I didn't
[1:19:03] need to be here at that event you didn't
[1:19:05] need to be here at event but one person
[1:19:08] that needed to be here was the seventh
[1:19:10] angel ain't that right Pope didn't the
[1:19:13] president all them people didn't need to
[1:19:14] be here but a prophet needed to be here
[1:19:17] so that seventh angel was on the earth
[1:19:19] at the same time of this coming if he
[1:19:22] wasn't here that a mighty Angel wouldn't
[1:19:23] have come
[1:19:25] down but but so so the mighty Angel
[1:19:28] comes down and gives the book right the
[1:19:32] Lord uh uh uh uh to the seventh angel uh
[1:19:36] uh so so then then we find that the
[1:19:38] seventh angel which is the prophet of
[1:19:41] Malachi 4 reveals the revelation of the
[1:19:45] book that's been given to him it's not a
[1:19:47] literal book that was given to him it
[1:19:51] was the revelation of of the book that
[1:19:54] was given to him the word came to a
[1:19:58] prophet ain't that right now notice art
[1:20:01] do we now now you know it's it's one
[1:20:03] thing to talk about the stories of
[1:20:04] brother brandham I love to hear about
[1:20:06] the stories of brother brandham uh uh
[1:20:09] actually uh I received a letter the
[1:20:11] other day of uh someone writing uh uh
[1:20:14] their eyewitness account of brother
[1:20:16] brandom praying for King George and and
[1:20:20] and uh explain going through all that
[1:20:23] that was phenomenal to me I I enjoyed
[1:20:25] reading that and and and so so you you
[1:20:28] have these things but but we God did not
[1:20:31] call us just to to think about the past
[1:20:33] and to dwell upon the past and and and
[1:20:35] talk about you know it it'd be just as
[1:20:37] bad as as as the denominations uh uh
[1:20:40] talking about Bible stories you know and
[1:20:42] well you can't get warmed by a painted
[1:20:44] fire you know and and so God never
[1:20:46] called us as message Believers to paint
[1:20:49] painted Fires for our young people and
[1:20:51] and and for our own lives and all that
[1:20:53] so God would give us something to do and
[1:20:55] it's all in Revelations 10 as well see
[1:20:59] so so here it is in in Revelations 10:8
[1:21:03] John said that the voice which I heard
[1:21:06] uh uh from Heaven spake unto me again
[1:21:09] and said go get up get into action go
[1:21:13] take that little book which is open in
[1:21:17] the hand of the Angel which standeth
[1:21:19] upon the sea and up on the earth ain't
[1:21:22] that right
[1:21:23] so now this tells us that every man has
[1:21:26] to have the same inspiration that the
[1:21:29] prophet had in order to get the true
[1:21:31] revelation of what the prophet brought
[1:21:34] ain't that right see the prophet
[1:21:36] received this book or Revelation by
[1:21:39] inspiration of God ain't that right he
[1:21:42] was not under the inspiration of
[1:21:44] Television he was not under the
[1:21:45] inspiration of Technology he was not in
[1:21:48] the under the inspiration of whatever
[1:21:50] else is that goes on in these days
[1:21:53] he received the Revelation because he
[1:21:55] was under inspiration of almighty God
[1:21:59] ain't that right now if you're going to
[1:22:02] understand the book if you're going to
[1:22:04] understand this message you've got to
[1:22:06] come to that same place of un
[1:22:08] inspiration to receive the same
[1:22:11] Revelation that the prophet gave it can
[1:22:13] you say Amen now brother brandom says I
[1:22:16] pray that the same inspiration that was
[1:22:18] given to me to speak it to you that you
[1:22:21] received it in the same inspiration that
[1:22:24] it was sent in come on Church the angel
[1:22:29] of the Lord told Brother Bram you must
[1:22:30] be more sincere than ever before well I
[1:22:33] believe that applies to you and I as
[1:22:36] well amen all right now brother Braham
[1:22:40] said if the true spirit of God is there
[1:22:42] it'll direct it into the word not just
[1:22:44] one place in the word but the entire
[1:22:47] word for the entire age see so the
[1:22:51] spirit of God a amen now coming upon the
[1:22:53] people he's he's going to have
[1:22:55] preeminence in a body amen and what that
[1:22:58] is is the Revelation that God would give
[1:23:00] to a bride amen through a prophet now
[1:23:03] that spirit is taking that same word and
[1:23:06] directing it right into our hearts amen
[1:23:09] not just one portion of the word but the
[1:23:11] whole entire thing God able to have the
[1:23:15] preeminence in his body Hallelujah now
[1:23:20] see that's the spirit of God that's what
[1:23:21] happened on the day of Pentecost amen is
[1:23:24] is the prophet said the spirit directed
[1:23:27] it right into that word amen right into
[1:23:30] the word they just didn't receive an
[1:23:32] experience amen but that experience was
[1:23:34] right from the word amen and the spirit
[1:23:37] of God that came to them opened their
[1:23:38] eyes and their understanding to to to to
[1:23:41] what amen was going on see and so Peter
[1:23:44] said this is that which was spoken by
[1:23:47] the prophet Joel a ain't that right see
[1:23:50] now everyone else was looking at at the
[1:23:52] the the the phenomenon and they were
[1:23:54] calling it well these men are drunk they
[1:23:55] were calling it natural wine they were
[1:23:57] calling it a natural thing and and and
[1:23:59] and all of these things but Peter having
[1:24:02] an understanding of what was taking
[1:24:05] place why he had the spirit upon him the
[1:24:08] same spirit amen that was upon that
[1:24:11] Prophet Joel that would prophesy of this
[1:24:14] event now that same Spirit was upon
[1:24:17] Peter Amen to recognize that amen that
[1:24:20] prophecy was being fulfilled right
[1:24:22] before them and in
[1:24:26] them in Luther's day the spirit directed
[1:24:29] it into the word the just shall live by
[1:24:31] faith in Wesley's day the spirit
[1:24:33] directed it into the word in the
[1:24:35] Pentecostal movement the prophet said
[1:24:37] the spirit directed it into that word
[1:24:41] and the spirit is doing it again in our
[1:24:44] day amen now notice the prophet said
[1:24:47] this is the calling out of the Bride not
[1:24:49] 2,000 years ago at Pentecost or the the
[1:24:52] repeat or the return now is the bride
[1:24:55] calling everybody say this is the bride
[1:24:58] calling amen why because now the spirit
[1:25:01] of God now notice the spirit of God in
[1:25:03] that Prophet is directing him right into
[1:25:06] the word for this age no one could
[1:25:08] understand these things you ain't
[1:25:09] hearing you ain't seeing these
[1:25:11] denominations and these these uh
[1:25:13] Independence and all that talking about
[1:25:15] a bride coming of Christ and and a bride
[1:25:17] coming out of the out of the churches
[1:25:20] and all of that they're trying to get us
[1:25:21] into the church churches they're trying
[1:25:23] to join us together but there was a man
[1:25:25] who was inspired by God that received
[1:25:29] the book receive the Revelation and
[1:25:31] began to declare it's a bride coming it
[1:25:34] it's a calling out of this Bride Can you
[1:25:36] say amen and now we by the same
[1:25:39] inspiration receive it for us he said
[1:25:42] now this is the bride calling now is
[1:25:46] when the Seven Seals has been opened now
[1:25:49] when the complete things that the
[1:25:50] reformers have left has to be opened and
[1:25:53] only Malachi 4 can do that because it
[1:25:56] takes the Revelation straight from God
[1:25:58] to an individual see to do so that's
[1:26:02] right it can't come to a group never did
[1:26:05] one man and that's what God promised in
[1:26:07] the shadows of the coming for his bride
[1:26:10] uh and elaser so elaser was a type of
[1:26:13] this last day
[1:26:15] messenger ain't that right remember
[1:26:17] that's what brother brandom he was
[1:26:19] asking God could you show me what part
[1:26:20] of I am in the word amen and and his
[1:26:23] Bible opened up to El eer getting a
[1:26:26] bride for Isaac right and he said and
[1:26:27] that's what I'm here for is to get a
[1:26:30] bride for Christ Hallelujah yes sir but
[1:26:34] you know what before eler got there
[1:26:36] brother Bram said 30 minutes before eler

[1:28:45] things like that that that comes with
[1:28:48] with bitterness see see it's it's a joy

[1:29:18] Bram talks about it they've been
[1:29:19] Unleashed against the bride it's it's to
[1:29:22] the bride can you say Amen but they'll
[1:29:24] never be able to take her out you
[1:29:25] understand that but notice he's eating
[1:29:27] the book he's feeling this odd uh he's
[1:29:30] feeling the good about it he's feeling
[1:29:31] the bitterness of it and and these
[1:29:33] things but notice now what he's
[1:29:35] commanded to do thou must prophesy again
[1:29:39] Lord see now he's putting John in a in a
[1:29:41] Ministry he could not God would not have
[1:29:43] given him Ministry amen without him
[1:29:45] first eating the book ain't that right
[1:29:49] yeah Dr Dobson does not give you the
[1:29:51] ministry guar
[1:29:55] hello you you got a ministry as a father
[1:29:57] you got a ministry as a mother you got a
[1:30:00] ministry as as preachers you got a
[1:30:02] ministry as music you got a Ministry of
[1:30:04] of whatever but there is no man that can
[1:30:06] put you in the
[1:30:08] ministry you eat the
[1:30:10] book that's what this bride is to do is
[1:30:13] eat the book not interested in what they
[1:30:15] all have to say that's not the book I'm
[1:30:18] to
[1:30:20] eat and you
[1:30:22] amen thou must prophesy again before
[1:30:25] many peoples Nations tongues and Kings
[1:30:28] see so notice thou must prophesy again
[1:30:32] this isn't a gift of Prophecy that that
[1:30:35] that is is mentioned in in as as one of
[1:30:39] the nine spiritual gifts that God placed
[1:30:41] in the body as one of the you know as
[1:30:43] nine spiritual gifts this prophesying is
[1:30:46] a
[1:30:47] confession and and the word confession
[1:30:50] means to say the same thing at has a
[1:30:52] ain't that right so remember the spirit
[1:30:55] the prophet and the bride will be saying
[1:30:58] the same thing you got to eat the
[1:31:03] book get under the same inspiration to
[1:31:06] receive the same
[1:31:09] Revelation praise the
[1:31:11] Lord then you'll be saying the same
[1:31:13] thing brother Bram said see God still
[1:31:16] has a voice do you believe that God
[1:31:18] still has a voice for the people of the
[1:31:21] world
[1:31:22] even as he has given a voice to the
[1:31:24] bride that voice is in the
[1:31:30] bride see she's the one that has thus
[1:31:32] sayi the Lord Brother Bram said they
[1:31:35] know that it's his voice because it's
[1:31:37] the promised word of the
[1:31:40] day ain't that right don't tell me that
[1:31:43] the voice of God is in you and you're
[1:31:45] still preaching a foolish virgin
[1:31:48] message come on come on now hello or
[1:31:52] some denominational
[1:31:54] Doctrine it it it it see it is
[1:31:56] impossible to say the same thing as make
[1:32:00] that confession unless you have received
[1:32:03] it under the same inspiration that it
[1:32:04] was taught or given Lord ain't that
[1:32:08] right so this prophesying this
[1:32:12] prophesying is about the word becoming
[1:32:16] flesh thou must prophesy
[1:32:19] again this is to every bride remember
[1:32:22] that eats the
[1:32:23] book thou must prophesy again now notice
[1:32:27] how we need in Jeffersonville thousands
[1:32:30] of
[1:32:31] lived everybody say lived
[1:32:35] voices so this prophesying is not just
[1:32:38] some just the talking or speaking in
[1:32:41] tongues and interpretation of tongues
[1:32:43] and all of that it's actually the word
[1:32:45] that you have eaten now becomes
[1:32:48] reflected through you word made flesh
[1:32:51] you become written Epistles read and
[1:32:54] known of all men how we need in
[1:32:56] Jeffersonville thousands of live voices
[1:32:59] the Thunder of of God thundering out in
[1:33:01] sweetness and Holiness Purity undefiled
[1:33:04] lives walking around in the Earth today
[1:33:07] without a blemish yes sir real
[1:33:09] Christians that's the Thunder against
[1:33:11] the enemy the devil don't care how loud
[1:33:14] you can holler the devil don't care how
[1:33:16] much you can jump or how much you can do
[1:33:18] this or shout but What Hurts The Devil
[1:33:21] is to see that Sanctified holy life
[1:33:23] consecrated to God say anything to him
[1:33:26] call any him anything just as sweet as
[1:33:28] it can be and move right on oh my that
[1:33:31] throws him away that's the Thunder that
[1:33:34] shakes the
[1:33:35] devil well you say well if if if he
[1:33:38] could just preach just like Billy Graham
[1:33:40] or an or Roberts or something a great in
[1:33:42] influential speaker oh no sometimes the
[1:33:46] devil just laughs at that he don't pay
[1:33:48] no more attention to that than nothing
[1:33:50] see you get all the theology he wanted
[1:33:52] to and all the Seminary training and the
[1:33:55] devil just sits back and laughs at that
[1:33:57] but when he sees that
[1:34:01] life when he sees the life so John now
[1:34:05] eats the book and the book becomes him
[1:34:08] he becomes the
[1:34:10] book ain't that right that's right
[1:34:13] that's the Thunder of God that is
[1:34:15] shaking the
[1:34:18] enemy
[1:34:19] that now you're coming into not just
[1:34:22] your ministry but now you're coming into
[1:34:24] the will of God prise the Lord anyone
[1:34:27] can speak in tongues and live like a
[1:34:29] devil that's right anyone can prophesy
[1:34:31] brother Brown taught us that he showed
[1:34:33] us that two men were prophesying one was
[1:34:36] genuine both of them was accurate true
[1:34:38] one was genuine the other one was living
[1:34:40] with a woman it wasn't even his wife had
[1:34:42] children by
[1:34:44] her have I ever saw a devil there was
[1:34:46] one
[1:34:48] there this is a bride amen
[1:34:52] on see a person can't eat the book and
[1:34:54] live contrary to what the prophet taught
[1:34:57] and lived
[1:34:59] himself amen see so what life is it what
[1:35:02] life are we talking about that that what
[1:35:04] is the thunder it's word
[1:35:06] life word life so John didn't represent
[1:35:10] the carnal man and the carnal mind and
[1:35:13] he represented the individual who has
[1:35:15] been born again from above praise the
[1:35:17] Lord that's what the prophet called it
[1:35:19] you're been born again from above
[1:35:22] ain't that right and God's life in US
[1:35:24] causes us to be active he says in the
[1:35:27] things amen from above amen see his life
[1:35:32] is his word in US vindicating the word
[1:35:35] itself see his life is now in us his
[1:35:41] life is his word in US vindicating this
[1:35:44] written word
[1:35:48] amen now notice brother Brown said see
[1:35:50] the spirit that's in you is the word
[1:35:52] made flesh in you the spirit Minds the
[1:35:56] word and is active in vindicating the
[1:36:00] word praise the Lord that's right A lot
[1:36:03] of people saying I got the Holy Ghost
[1:36:05] yeah but notice what the brother said
[1:36:07] now the spirit that's in you is the word
[1:36:09] made flesh in you the spirit Minds the
[1:36:12] word and is active in vindicating the
[1:36:15] word amen where in you in me in the
[1:36:19] bride now see the spirit is not active
[1:36:23] in any denomination it's not interested
[1:36:25] in making organization because the
[1:36:28] spirit itself is contrary to the
[1:36:30] organization the organization are
[1:36:32] looking for worldly things mind of the
[1:36:35] world see they they they make big
[1:36:37] temples polished things and great
[1:36:39] polished organizations polished
[1:36:40] ministers preachers and so forth like
[1:36:43] that and has the best class in the city
[1:36:45] where the spirit see that's what
[1:36:47] denomination is trying to do where the
[1:36:50] spirit is trying to find Honest Hearts
[1:36:52] where the spirit is anxious to manifest
[1:36:55] and prove that every word of God is
[1:36:58] true I hope you understand the
[1:37:00] difference between being outside the
[1:37:02] body and inside the body the difference
[1:37:05] in Ministry outside the body and in the
[1:37:10] body praise the Lord he said how can you
[1:37:14] he said how can the spirit working an
[1:37:15] organization when it's denying taking
[1:37:18] Creeds when that organization is taking
[1:37:20] Creeds instead of the word of God yeah
[1:37:22] you can't do it see it's dead God don't
[1:37:24] go to them kinds of places to find his a
[1:37:27] group of men to work for him cuz they
[1:37:29] already dead they're unbelievers in the
[1:37:31] word or or they wouldn't be in there see
[1:37:35] we are active in the things from above
[1:37:37] see the spirit Minds the word now that's
[1:37:39] right because the spirit gives the word
[1:37:43] life ain't that right praise the Lord
[1:37:46] now as we continue on for a few minutes
[1:37:50] but as I said you know Sunday night man
[1:37:52] was made or last morning uh Sunday
[1:37:56] morning made to to achieve things for
[1:37:59] God and and but he could only achieve as
[1:38:03] long as he stayed within the premises of
[1:38:05] God's
[1:38:06] will uh and and he was successful in
[1:38:09] what he done as long as he worked
[1:38:12] according to God's will but then the
[1:38:14] fall came and and man because man wanted
[1:38:19] to achieve something
[1:38:21] uh outside of God's help and he become
[1:38:25] his own unit and so now he leaves he
[1:38:28] left God out of the picture and and and
[1:38:31] so and this is where we're at today
[1:38:33] throughout time man has achieved many
[1:38:35] things uh for you know great Great
[1:38:39] accomplishments but has done so outside
[1:38:41] the will of God all the accomplishments
[1:38:44] that man has done has been outside the
[1:38:46] will of God so therefore he is achieving
[1:38:49] for himself and not for God brother Bri
[1:38:51] said he has selfish Mo motives he he's a
[1:38:54] selfish individual man is he's he's
[1:38:57] selfish in his motives he's got selfish
[1:39:00] agenda he is
[1:39:01] self-centered uh uh and and you know you
[1:39:04] think of it that we're living in a day
[1:39:06] where where most well we we are
[1:39:10] considered to be uh a Christian Nation
[1:39:13] by most I don't know about Obama but uh
[1:39:16] most of us you know consider ourselves a
[1:39:19] great Christian Nation and most people
[1:39:22] consider themselves to be Christians
[1:39:24] anymore and and the world is maybe
[1:39:26] coming to that uh as well but but yet in
[1:39:31] this age where everything has become
[1:39:34] christianized and and all of that uh
[1:39:36] we're we're we're living where the Bible
[1:39:39] prophesied that men would be lovers of
[1:39:41] their own selves more than lovers of God
[1:39:43] now you think of that the the Christian
[1:39:46] Nation Christian everybody I'm a
[1:39:49] Christian oh yes you know hardly ever
[1:39:51] goes to church but I'm Christian
[1:39:53] drinking smok I'm Christian you know uh
[1:39:56] uh I mean it's it's even coming to
[1:39:58] transgender being Christians and all
[1:40:00] that everything is being accepted today
[1:40:04] and and yet the problem is is they
[1:40:06] lovers of pleasure lovers of themselves
[1:40:09] more than they are lovers of God yet
[1:40:11] these people are preaching singing
[1:40:13] playing music they're deacons holding
[1:40:15] offices in the church and even having
[1:40:19] religious rallies worldwide and and and
[1:40:23] they give to others in various ways oh
[1:40:26] you're talking about programs and
[1:40:28] pouring money into people feeding the
[1:40:30] poor and helping in this and helping in
[1:40:33] that and it sounds good but but the core
[1:40:36] of it is they're lovers of their own
[1:40:38] selves than they are lovers of God
[1:40:40] they're lovers of pleasure more than
[1:40:41] they are lovers of of God and and so
[1:40:45] they can do all of this and yet be
[1:40:47] self-centered and self uh indulged and
[1:40:51] and have selfish motives and all of this
[1:40:54] thing and you say well how can they how
[1:40:56] can that be uh uh how can they give so
[1:40:59] much and how can they do of their time
[1:41:00] and how can they pour their energy and
[1:41:03] all of these things and still be selfish
[1:41:05] in all this amen you know why because
[1:41:07] they're doing it their own way they're
[1:41:09] not doing it according to God's way
[1:41:11] they're not doing it according to God's
[1:41:12] will they'll never become subject uh
[1:41:15] come under subject to God's Will and
[1:41:17] purpose it's why they want to do what
[1:41:20] they want to give what they want their
[1:41:24] Ministry and before you know it it's the
[1:41:26] individual that's recognized and really
[1:41:28] not God oh we can't do without that
[1:41:30] individual no you can do without the
[1:41:32] individual you can't do without
[1:41:37] godl what's the need to pray if you got
[1:41:40] you if if if if you know for food or
[1:41:44] money or whatever when when you got
[1:41:46] programs out there that you can go what
[1:41:49] the need to pray and really get down
[1:41:51] serious with God when you got all this
[1:41:53] scientific medication and and all these
[1:41:57] things amen and in the middle of all
[1:42:01] this brother Bram said faith will be
[1:42:02] slow why because man has done their own
[1:42:07] thing accomplish great things but not
[1:42:09] according to the will of
[1:42:11] God so so what good does it do to preach
[1:42:14] when the revealed word is not being
[1:42:16] brought forth to help the people what
[1:42:18] good is it to sing gospel songs when the
[1:42:20] one sing is living a life contrary to
[1:42:22] the revealed word of God what good is it
[1:42:25] to prophesy if it isn't done according
[1:42:26] to the word of God what good is it to
[1:42:28] help feed the people and and care for
[1:42:30] them in the Natural Things of life if
[1:42:32] we're not in line with the word of God
[1:42:34] see so so so so people people people can
[1:42:38] do things in great achievements and
[1:42:40] things but but when they're not in the
[1:42:42] will of God they're drawing attention to
[1:42:44] themselves instead of
[1:42:47] God ain't that right and all of these
[1:42:50] things may be a a display of compassion
[1:42:53] we thank God for compassion thank God
[1:42:55] for people that still has compassion
[1:42:56] that's right but you know what there's
[1:42:58] only one real compassion that really
[1:43:00] works and that's Godly compassion and
[1:43:03] brother Bram said Godly compassion is is
[1:43:06] doing God's will Godly compassion is
[1:43:09] doing God's will that's what he a lot of
[1:43:12] compassion people doing everything that
[1:43:14] they want to do I mean there there's
[1:43:16] people that give millions of dollars to
[1:43:19] help the poor and all that and don't
[1:43:20] even claim to be Christian or they may
[1:43:23] claim to be Christian but they're
[1:43:24] dressed like and harlots and
[1:43:26] everything against
[1:43:31] God ain't that right but Godly
[1:43:34] compassion is doing the will of God so
[1:43:36] the unregenerated man he has a carnal
[1:43:38] mind a carnal nature that his enity
[1:43:40] against God is Not subject to the law of
[1:43:43] God and indeed cannot be so science
[1:43:45] works against God's plan Education Works
[1:43:48] against God's plan and we will'll even
[1:43:50] goes to say that religion works against
[1:43:52] God's
[1:43:54] plan can you say Amen because it's it's
[1:43:58] the work of a carnal it's the
[1:43:59] achievement of the carnal man who is
[1:44:02] against God and God you know go God
[1:44:06] can't fulfill his purpose God cannot
[1:44:08] have preeminence in them types of
[1:44:10] Ministries as great Ministries as they
[1:44:13] may be God can't have preeminence in
[1:44:15] them
[1:44:16] Ministries on but God says I'll have a
[1:44:19] people that I can have preeminence in
[1:44:23] and it won't be human compassion that
[1:44:24] they display it'll be my
[1:44:26] compassion it won't be just be a
[1:44:28] Ministry it'll be my
[1:44:31] Ministry because I can work through them
[1:44:33] ain't that right see and God will get
[1:44:36] glory for it yes prise the Lord so God
[1:44:39] will not be defeated and his purpose
[1:44:41] will not be and go
[1:44:44] unfulfilled man is the agency whereby
[1:44:47] God's purpose and will is fulfilled
[1:44:51] and we read this last Sunday morning
[1:44:53] that God wants to fulfill his word and
[1:44:55] he don't have any hands but mine and
[1:44:57] yours he don't have any eyes but mine
[1:44:59] and yours he has no tongue but mine and
[1:45:01] yours I'm the vine you're the branches
[1:45:03] he said see see the branches bear the
[1:45:05] fruit the vine energizes the branch he
[1:45:09] energizes us and we bring forth his life
[1:45:11] as he brings it through us whether it's
[1:45:14] preaching the gospel by lip or saying
[1:45:16] Vision by eye whether it's whatever it
[1:45:18] is laying hands on the sick whatever it
[1:45:20] is is it's Christ working through the
[1:45:22] branches of his church every office
[1:45:24] literally electrified by his presence
[1:45:28] see so the people who are ordained to
[1:45:30] fulfill his purpose are baptized into
[1:45:33] one body by one Spirit ain't that right
[1:45:37] and so as members of this body we have
[1:45:40] been given a Ministry some are called to
[1:45:43] preach some are called to
[1:45:45] sing uh you know as I've said you know
[1:45:48] some fathers musici Ians mothers
[1:45:52] Housewives we all have a Ministry and
[1:45:55] and every member has a place in the body
[1:45:59] of Christ and has that Ministry then
[1:46:02] then if if that be the case and it is
[1:46:05] then every member of the body is
[1:46:07] important do you believe that and and
[1:46:09] not because of what we are to bring to
[1:46:12] the table yeah not because we've got all
[1:46:16] this to offer see whether you you say
[1:46:19] well I got a good singing voice I can
[1:46:20] for that one that'd be really good well
[1:46:22] that's not why you're important
[1:46:26] amen you're important in the
[1:46:29] body and I I'll say this because I
[1:46:32] believe it is because your Nature has
[1:46:34] been
[1:46:35] changed your Nature has been changed
[1:46:38] what good is it to have a
[1:46:40] Ministry if your nature hasn't been
[1:46:43] changed so so there your Nature has been
[1:46:46] changed now every member of that body
[1:46:51] their objective their motive is now to
[1:46:55] do the will of God their energy is now
[1:46:58] to do the will of God they're able now
[1:47:00] to put God first of over everything of
[1:47:03] their life God first God first God first
[1:47:06] the Lord that's why you're important in
[1:47:08] the body it's not because you preach to
[1:47:10] thousands or you preach to one there's
[1:47:12] that does not make you less
[1:47:14] important it's it's not because you know
[1:47:17] whether whether or not you you can play
[1:47:19] in a band or or you just play in a small
[1:47:21] little old church that that's that's not
[1:47:23] the importance the importance what makes
[1:47:26] you important and invaluable is your
[1:47:28] Nature has been changed now you're not
[1:47:31] doing things through sish motives now
[1:47:33] you can be submissive now you can come
[1:47:35] under subjection to the word of God and
[1:47:37] the will and the plan of God see because
[1:47:40] Ministry is only successful when it is
[1:47:42] working in accordance to the will of God
[1:47:45] a ain't that right cuz even when Moses
[1:47:48] for example was ordained we know he was
[1:47:50] ordained he knew he was called to
[1:47:52] deliver the people he was taught that
[1:47:53] from his from from uh uh from a child
[1:47:56] amen you you're taught God God has
[1:47:58] called you you've been called to deliver
[1:48:00] the people you are a deliverer you are
[1:48:02] to be the leader so he understood that
[1:48:05] but it was all intellectually amen so
[1:48:07] the day day come he decides he's going
[1:48:09] to take care of things and what does he
[1:48:11] do he miserably
[1:48:14] failed true that's right ain't that
[1:48:17] right amen see because he tried to do it
[1:48:20] outside of God's
[1:48:23] will but the prophet said when he found
[1:48:25] the direct will of God and the time of
[1:48:27] God and received the revelation of what
[1:48:30] to do how to do
[1:48:33] it on he was
[1:48:36] successful ain't that right nothing
[1:48:38] could stand in his way see God never
[1:48:40] called Moses to deliver the people his
[1:48:42] people by his own wisdom his own ability
[1:48:45] his own his own power amen see but when
[1:48:49] he was a able to get Moses from looking
[1:48:52] at himself his abilities his talents and
[1:48:55] what did he had to do he had to strip
[1:48:58] Moses to where the only thing that Moses
[1:49:00] saw was his
[1:49:02] weakness amen I
[1:49:06] stutter if God would have come to Moses
[1:49:08] when he was a younger
[1:49:10] man man you picked the right guy
[1:49:13] buddy we'll do it you just sit back and
[1:49:16] let old Moses take care of
[1:49:18] things but he tried to and he fail but
[1:49:22] when God got him so surrendered God
[1:49:24] stripped him of everything
[1:49:26] thing and God knows how to strip his
[1:49:30] bride every member is going to go
[1:49:32] through it every
[1:49:34] member praise the Lord I know some
[1:49:36] people rebel against the dealings with
[1:49:38] god brother brown or the Bible says a
[1:49:41] man a person that cannot cannot humble
[1:49:44] themselves and cannot when God chastises
[1:49:47] them and they cannot take that
[1:49:49] chastisement they're same as the bastard
[1:49:52] childen every man every woman boy or
[1:49:55] girl that comes to God must be chastened
[1:49:57] of the
[1:49:57] Lord that's true you say oh but man I I
[1:50:01] got things I could do I could do don't
[1:50:05] matter God's going to strip you
[1:50:07] down to where you become dependent upon
[1:50:12] him Lord ain't that right see so when
[1:50:16] God finally got Moses from looking at
[1:50:18] his own self and his own abilities then
[1:50:20] the prophet said he could reveal his
[1:50:22] plan to Moses praise the Lord that's
[1:50:25] right and Moses could accept it and it
[1:50:27] was totally different from what Moses
[1:50:30] thought now the prophet said Moses
[1:50:33] wasn't looking at himself he was looking
[1:50:35] to the
[1:50:36] word he was looking to the word first
[1:50:38] and foremost see he what was the word
[1:50:41] the word that God had
[1:50:44] promised my now Moses knew the time was
[1:50:48] right ain't that right the prophet said
[1:50:50] he had Direct contact with God to know
[1:50:52] how and when to do it see so God has a
[1:50:55] time for his word to be fulfilled he has
[1:50:58] a way for his word to be fulfilled he
[1:51:00] has the person for his word to be
[1:51:02] fulfilled but it ain't going to be to
[1:51:04] what you
[1:51:05] thought come
[1:51:10] on you love him amen I hope this all
[1:51:15] right so each of us another thing each
[1:51:19] of us must be in the position that God
[1:51:21] has ordained for us in order to fulfill
[1:51:24] his
[1:51:25] will if God has called me to be a
[1:51:27] businessman then that's where I am to
[1:51:30] fulfill his
[1:51:31] will if God has called me to be a
[1:51:34] teacher school teacher then that's where
[1:51:36] I'm
[1:51:37] ordained that's where I'm going to
[1:51:39] fulfill his
[1:51:41] will if God's called me to be the
[1:51:43] electrician that's where I'm to do his
[1:51:44] will if God's called me to be a preacher
[1:51:46] that's where I'm going to do his
[1:51:48] will whatever God has called us in no
[1:51:51] matter what that's where you are going
[1:51:54] to fulfill his will outside of that you
[1:51:56] can do whatever you want to and you'll
[1:51:58] be a failure
[1:52:00] amen amen so see I I I if if if God is
[1:52:05] called me to be something then see I
[1:52:08] can't take brother Tim's place he can't
[1:52:10] take my place
[1:52:12] amen but is it anyone less important
[1:52:16] nope it's the body
[1:52:18] amen ain't that right see so then if if
[1:52:24] God has called you ladies to be a
[1:52:27] housewife do you realize you'll not
[1:52:29] fulfill God's purpose outside of
[1:52:33] that he's called you ordained you to be
[1:52:35] a mother then be a
[1:52:38] mother don't don't try to take your
[1:52:40] husband's place don't tell your husband
[1:52:43] how to do his
[1:52:44] job
[1:52:47] amen so many of the leoes sometimes and
[1:52:50] churches try to tell the pastor how to
[1:52:51] do it oh my and it's so funny because
[1:52:54] you think they were the pastor makes you
[1:52:56] want to just get up and say here once
[1:52:57] you have a seat right here and I'll sit
[1:52:58] over there so you can Pastor me a little
[1:53:02] bit it's totally out of position that's
[1:53:06] right totally out of
[1:53:08] line see
[1:53:11] so brother brandom says this there is
[1:53:13] one bride everybody say there's one
[1:53:15] bride not a
[1:53:17] dozen denominations
[1:53:20] but one bride that's elected out of the
[1:53:23] earth that's been predestinated to this
[1:53:27] now notice now this is important the
[1:53:29] ones who can recognize their place in
[1:53:32] the Kingdom amen Who belongs in the
[1:53:35] bride who's going to be part of that
[1:53:36] bride the ones who can recognize their
[1:53:39] place in the Kingdom well how am I going
[1:53:42] to recognize my place by being submitted
[1:53:44] to
[1:53:45] God letting him have that preeminence
[1:53:48] over your life
[1:53:51] see the bride is part of her husband
[1:53:53] ain't that right the Book of Genesis we
[1:53:55] know that that God took her out of her
[1:53:57] husband took the woman out of her
[1:53:59] husband and in Genesis 2:23 Adam said
[1:54:01] this is now bone of my bone Flesh of My
[1:54:03] Flesh she shall be called woman because
[1:54:05] she it was taken out of man so if you're
[1:54:08] the bride of Christ you've been taken
[1:54:10] out of Christ he's the word you're the
[1:54:12] word you're part of that your husband is
[1:54:14] the word you United with him are are the
[1:54:18] word of God amen notice brother brand

[1:54:22] recognize it the only place you'll ever
[1:54:24] recognize it is recognize what part of
[1:54:27] that husband that word you
[1:54:30] are how do I know beyond a sh of a doubt
[1:54:33] that I'm United I've been that my
[1:54:36] husband is the word quit disobeying the
[1:54:38] word you'll never recognize it by by
[1:54:41] disobeying the
[1:54:42] word but you'll recognize it when you
[1:54:45] fall into your
[1:54:47] position amen hello amen what he says
[1:54:50] see you recognize what part of that
[1:54:53] husband you are see you can't recognize
[1:54:56] being the bride or or you cannot
[1:54:58] recognize being the bride you have to
[1:55:00] recognize your
[1:55:02] position you cannot recognize somebody

[1:55:11] your place your
[1:55:15] position and what does it do it fits in
[1:55:17] the
[1:55:18] body now look where we're at as a bride
[1:55:21] how God has so blessed us with a prophet
[1:55:25] amen and what has happened brother
[1:55:27] Brandman the Feast of trumpet said
[1:55:28] National Force will will put Israel in
[1:55:30] her Homeland and we see that it's done
[1:55:33] it through the Holocaust Amen brother
[1:55:35] Bram says it's the tender hand of
[1:55:37] Jehovah we would have never understood
[1:55:39] that
[1:55:40] one without a prophet telling us what
[1:55:43] happened and what it was all about and
[1:55:46] we just believe it right amen National
[1:55:48] Force put is back in her position yeah
[1:55:51] National Force is going to put the
[1:55:53] church in the world Council of churches
[1:55:55] that's right but the power of God is
[1:55:58] putting the bride in her
[1:56:02] place stay with the
[1:56:06] message listen to that message you say
[1:56:09] well I've already heard that tape listen
[1:56:10] to it
[1:56:13] again absolutely till it becomes part of
[1:56:16] you am that's right ain't that right the
[1:56:19] power of God is putting the bride see
[1:56:21] the spirit of God which is the word of
[1:56:24] God will put her in her position she
[1:56:27] will recognize her position then she's
[1:56:31] in Christ can you say Amen do you love
[1:56:35] the Lord amen I love him if the
[1:56:37] musicians will come praise His name
[1:56:40] we're living in a day of total confusion
[1:56:43] total because and and and and I'll be
[1:56:46] honest it's because the people you
[1:56:50] know no one likes the position that God
[1:56:52] has called them to oh wow and it's
[1:56:55] becoming more of a confusion the name Le
[1:56:59] oysa means people's rights
[1:57:02] amen so the world is has been working
[1:57:06] this is just the motive of Satan has
[1:57:07] been trying his best from the beginning
[1:57:11] is to get get Humanity not to recognize
[1:57:16] their place their position just like the
[1:57:18] woman the first woman was to be help
[1:57:20] meat to the man right that's what God
[1:57:22] Said She be help meat but what did she
[1:57:24] end up doing she had become more of a
[1:57:26] help meat to Satan through the serpent
[1:57:29] than she was to Adam
[1:57:33] hello see and and and so it's it's just
[1:57:36] Satan trying to get us everyone out of
[1:57:38] their position to be something else and
[1:57:40] all that but you know what when you're
[1:57:41] out of your position Satan's able to use
[1:57:43] you sure so so he's the world is is been
[1:57:49] working and working and now it's coming
[1:57:52] to a full thing of Satan's Eden to where
[1:57:55] there's no distinction between anything
[1:57:58] anybody can be whatever they want to
[1:58:00] [Music]
[1:58:02] be so I say to you if God ordained you
[1:58:04] to be a
[1:58:05] woman be
[1:58:08] content if God ordained you to be a man
[1:58:11] then be content if God ordained you to

[1:58:32] content ain't that right if there's ever
[1:58:35] time that people God's called a people
[1:58:37] to be content it's it's it's the bride
[1:58:39] the bride's going to be content with
[1:58:41] where God puts her cuz she's eating the
[1:58:44] book and God has come to a place that
[1:58:46] he's able to have have preeminence in in
[1:58:48] that bride
[1:58:50] and every member in that body is going
[1:58:51] to be

[1:59:48] God has called you and what God has
[1:59:50] allotted you that's

[2:00:02] me no just be content with what God's

[2:01:25] [Music]
[2:01:27] amen there's one thing about it there'll
[2:01:29] be a peace and contentment there will be
[2:01:31] an anointing on your life and everybody
[2:01:33] will recognize it God God will be there
[2:01:35] with you it's I don't know how to
[2:01:38] explain it but it'll be there the Lord
[2:01:41] but I'm not going to read it cuz it is
[2:01:43] lengthy but Matthew 25 and 14-30 you
[2:01:46] ought to go and read that Jesus talking
[2:01:48] about about the the the different three
[2:01:50] different men that he
[2:01:52] gave different talents
[2:01:55] to and the one that had the least
[2:01:59] Talent he didn't do nothing with it
[2:02:02] honestly I maybe he just felt like well
[2:02:05] he's only given me one Talent so surely
[2:02:07] he doesn't think much of
[2:02:09] me I don't I don't know what to do you
[2:02:12] know I mean so he just half-heartedly he
[2:02:15] wasn't content with it he he could have
[2:02:17] worked it he wasn't content with it so
[2:02:20] he buries
[2:02:23] it instead of doing something with it
[2:02:27] then when the lord of the house come
[2:02:29] back he found that the the one with five
[2:02:32] talents he
[2:02:34] doubled he done something with it the
[2:02:37] one with the two Talent he done
[2:02:38] something with
[2:02:39] it but that one
[2:02:41] man he had to hold his head down low and
[2:02:44] you got to remember the only ones we
[2:02:46] answer to Is God that's
[2:02:50] true you love the
[2:02:54] Lord Brother BR said
[2:02:57] see no matter how little of a
[2:02:59] congregation he gives you to
[2:03:01] Pastor how small the work seems to be
[2:03:04] just speak to the MU man or to the new
[2:03:08] news
[2:03:09] boy he will see
[2:03:13] [Music]
[2:03:14] it I hope you
[2:03:17] understand see so God gives you a
[2:03:19] capacity to work in but do you realize
[2:03:22] you reach more people than I would ever
[2:03:24] reach you'll you'll you'll reach people
[2:03:26] that I'll never even get to talk to I'll
[2:03:28] ever get to
[2:03:29] meet so it's not that he wants you to be
[2:03:32] in your business or in your ability to
[2:03:35] become
[2:03:36] successful man if I can just become boss
[2:03:38] if I can just become boss and you work
[2:03:40] work work work work work work work work
[2:03:42] to be that that what you want to be but
[2:03:45] maybe God has just called you to speak
[2:03:47] to people and maybe through your whole
[2:03:49] career it could just be one
[2:03:52] person so instead of being so
[2:03:54] business-minded or so materialistic
[2:03:58] minded or or whatever let's be godm
[2:04:02] minded that when we wake up say God what
[2:04:04] do you want me to do today who do you
[2:04:06] want me to speak to today who you going
[2:04:08] to lead in my life God may have not
[2:04:11] called you to speak to everybody in your
[2:04:12] life there may be that one individual
[2:04:15] that he does
[2:04:16] talk lead you to speak to amen and if
[2:04:20] you could be under an unction of God and
[2:04:22] be that channel that God could flow
[2:04:24] through and have preeminence over
[2:04:27] you that's that's that's what
[2:04:33] matters the r said you can't do nothing
[2:04:35] for Jesus unless he knows it you must
[2:04:39] remember he knows every little thing you
[2:04:41] do and he will give you all credit for
[2:04:45] that's what you've been detailed to do
[2:04:49] no matter how small it is do it
[2:04:55] anyhow give your all to it put your
[2:04:58] energy into it you may not be the
[2:05:02] preacher you may not be the
[2:05:07] musician but do something for
[2:05:09] God if you're going to be part of a
[2:05:11] church whether it's this church or some
[2:05:13] other Church be part of it then and do
[2:05:16] everything you can for it if if it's to
[2:05:19] sweep the the carpet if it's to if it's
[2:05:21] to sweep you know what whatever it is if
[2:05:23] it's to fix something if it's if it's
[2:05:26] just
[2:05:28] whatever do
[2:05:30] it cuz what you're doing is you're
[2:05:32] furthering the kingdom you you're being
[2:05:34] part of
[2:05:37] something you said well but I'm not
[2:05:39] recognized I'm I'm not well we could all
[2:05:41] be in that if really all looked at it if
[2:05:43] we're really doing this for a selfish
[2:05:46] thing man we have a lot to gripe
[2:05:50] about but you know what we're part of
[2:05:52] the body of Christ we're not doing it
[2:05:55] for selfish
[2:05:57] reasons the whole point is that his
[2:05:59] kingdom can be
[2:06:00] established that we can lead people to
[2:06:03] God that people can see God in
[2:06:05] us yeah but I'm My Own man nobody going
[2:06:07] to tell me what to do well God's going
[2:06:09] to tell you what to do if you're in his
[2:06:10] if he's got preeminence over
[2:06:13] [Music]
[2:06:15] you you
[2:06:17] loving
[2:06:19] Ram talks about that little lady that
[2:06:20] really just wanted to do something for
[2:06:22] God so bad God laid it upon her heart
[2:06:25] she was just a wash
[2:06:27] woman wasn't called to preach wasn't
[2:06:29] called to do anything but she just you
[2:06:31] know she just want to do something for
[2:06:33] God way back in the days you know 100
[2:06:37] two 200 300 years ago now I
[2:06:41] guess so she rented a livery stable for
[2:06:45] a dollar I think it was for a month or
[2:06:50] started cleaning it
[2:06:53] out just asking God to bless
[2:06:56] it then she started passing out tracks
[2:06:59] to the town people didn't want it to
[2:07:00] throw it away just laughed at her
[2:07:03] ridiculed her they weren't interested
[2:07:05] but she just kept on God but God had put
[2:07:08] it on her
[2:07:09] heart and that little boy she passed the
[2:07:12] little track said here you are little
[2:07:13] Sunny he said well what you doing well
[2:07:15] we're going to have a meeting tonight
[2:07:17] you're welcome to come
[2:07:19] all right I'll be
[2:07:21] there the preacher came began to preach
[2:07:24] just to that woman and that
[2:07:26] boy gave the altar calling that boy come
[2:07:29] gave his heart to the Lord probably that
[2:07:31] was DL
[2:07:32] Moody and look at what he done he won
[2:07:34] millions of
[2:07:36] souls is because someone wasn't looking
[2:07:39] for big things they just want to do
[2:07:41] something for
[2:07:42] God they just wanted to do what God had
[2:07:45] called them to do she wasn't trying to
[2:07:46] preach she wasn't trying to be whatever
[2:07:48] she just doing what God had laid on her
[2:07:52] heart that's what really matters isn't
