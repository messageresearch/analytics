to be here to I guess uh celebrate an early 50th birthday for brother Sean and uh and I I tell you what uh you know we were just going to wait and see if uh we we were able to pull it off if everyone was able to do it and uh uh to look the look on brother Sean's face was priceless and uh he was shocked and uh so uh that I tell you that was wonderful and but we sure love and appreciate uh your pastor very much and just a great man of God a man of integrity and character and and uh we just uh appreciate uh how that he has just emptied himself out for Christ's sake and um uh I tell you we uh we need men of God in this hour that will preach the truth and and preach it with conviction and believe that Jesus Christ is alive today and he's the same in in every way yesterday today and forever and uh I believe that you find that uh that those characteristics in uh brother Sean and we love him and uh love sister Heather and the family and I love you as a church and uh if you have your Bibles we'll uh turn to Matthew the 14th chapter we appreciate to all of the songs and uh it's just tremendous uh to be with my uh just my all of my family and uh uh We've we've got to leave uh uh get the get the kids and they start a school this past week and so we've got to get them back for school and so or you'd be hearing brother brother Wendell this morning and uh I I would definitely be definitely would rather be sitting out there listening to brother Wendell and uh but you'll you'll have a masterpiece tonight and uh wish we were here to pull on the word but Matthew the 14th chapter the 25th verse and then we'll also uh turn over to Romans the fourth chapter and the 19th verse and in the fourth watch of the night Jesus went unto them and when you look at that Fourth Watch there was the the time is broke up into different watches and um some believe that this could have or this is the the time is between three to six in the morning and uh this could be maybe the time of the dawning of of the new day and I thought that was striking because it's very parallel uh with our day and how brother Branham says it is the rising of the Sun so in the Fourth Watch of the night Jesus went unto them walking on the sea and when the disciples saw him walking on the sea they were troubled saying it is a spirit and they cried out for fear but straightway Jesus spake unto them saying be of goods here it is I Be not Afraid and Peter answered him and said Lord if it be thou bid me come unto thee on the water and he said come and when Peter was come down out of the ship he walked on the water to go to Jesus but when he saw the wind boisterous he was afraid and beginning to sink he cried saying Lord save me and immediately Jesus stretched forth his hand and caught him and said unto him oh thou of little faith wherefore did thou doubt now Romans the fourth chapter 19th verse reading to verse 21 and being not weak in faith he considered not his own body now dead when he was about 100 years old neither yet the deadness of Sarah's womb he staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief but was strong in faith giving glory to God and being fully persuaded that what he had promised he was able also to perform you don't have to turn to it but I'd like to just read John Saint John 11 and verse 40 and this is at the tomb of Lazarus Jesus said unto her Martha said I nod unto thee that if thou wouldest believe thou should see the glory of God now let's just bow our hearts and maybe you have something on your heart this morning and if you'd like to just raise a hand I know God sees us God knows us father with surrendered hearts and great love and great respects for you and your word and your promises father we ask that you would just bless your children minister to them Father Lord the songs have been sung the atmosphere has been created now God may your word just go right to the heart and speak to his father take us out of the way and hide us beneath the blood of Jesus Lord we'll be careful to give you all the glory and all the honor in the name of Jesus Christ amen and amen God bless you as you can have your seats I'd like to just for a text something that I've been pondering over and and uh just thinking about and uh that is Faith to hold on to God's promises and a very very simple thought but yet a very needful and a very powerful word I believe and and that is just simply that without faith it is impossible to please God and we as the Bride of Jesus Christ uh our desire is to please him and when we look at the walk that we have been predestinated to which is likened unto Enoch and uh Enoch had this testimony that he pleased God and he pleased God because it was a faith walk it was uh and Faith of course is a revelation and uh so he he walked with God according to Revelation the Divine uh wheel and the Divine Purpose of God was made known to him and he walked in that and that was uh Faith to him to Enoch and so it is that he he achieved a testimony that he pleased God through that Faith through that Revelation and that is the way that the bride finds satisfaction finds uh a way to fulfill the desire of her heart which any any bride has a desire to please her husband and and therefore the bride's desire to please him is only found in believing the word and follow fall of walking in that revealed wheel for this day which is actually the revealed will for her life and uh the scripture there in Revelations the 12th chapter says that we overcome by the blood of the lamb and the word of Our Testimony money and so I I can't think of any greater testimony than actually coming from our lips in knowing that we believe the word and and and knowing having this confidence that we please God and and we please him through our faith and and and therefore we we have this testimony that we believe the blood of the lamb and we believe the word and this is the age of the Overcomer the prophet would say that this is the age of the Overcomer the dispensation of overcoming and again the prophet would say and anything that wins a victory it's an overcoming something it overcomes their object that they're fighting against therefore if this is the dispensation of overcoming thing then we we are looking for victory and and we're contending for the faith and and that is to to get victory over over Satan and over all hell that has been released in this hour and and so it's it's our objective uh we want to see our family say we want to see uh the sick made a whole we we want to see individuals sealed under the kingdom of God by the Holy Ghost and and the the and uh John said that this is the victory that overcomes the world even our faith and so there's only one way in this in this dispensation of overcoming and there's only one way to get victory over our objective and that is Faith outside of Faith you can't get anything from God outside of Faith the word just lays dormant it's a seed but it but that word seed must have a fertile heart of faith and and and then the greatest thing is the power of commitment commit that word into a heart of faith and just let it go and it will bring forth of its kind it's a Word of Promise therefore faith is a revelation of the will of God the purpose of God for our lives and and it's the will of God to believe his word I I know that sounds very strange and even so Elementary uh to to say that it's very simple but yet in a world that we live in uh it's the will of God for you to believe his word amen I I you see denomination sin and many just the masses of people they fell on that one Revelation that the word of God is to be believed amen the word of God is the infallible Vindicated voice of God in this day and hour is not to be disputed it's not to be debated it's not to you know try to be figured out it is simply the will of God to believe the word amen if he said it believe it if he said you're healed then believe it if he said you're going to make the Rapture then believe it if he said you're more than an overcomer then just believe it just simply believe the word it is the will desire the very revealed revelation of God's thoughts for you to just take him at his word you see believe for the impossible don't don't limit God believe for the impossible amen and and and they would come to Jesus and they would ask you know the lepers would come will you heal us the blind would come will you heal us the dumb and the death would come will you believe will you heal us and he says if thou can'tst believe all things say that with me all things are possible to him that believeth Jesus never put a limitation on faith he never said well you can go so far in your faith and then you're gonna you're gonna top out amen all things all things the Supernatural is only limited to your faith amen but if you can take God at his word then all things are possible with God and all things are possible with you also because God's a believer and you're a Believer you are you are an eyeing of the very Faith Of God May manifest amen we find the wind when Sarah was having problems with her faith and she was laughing you know I was kind of snickering at a inner her heart amen because Elohim was there saying I've come to visit you I I remember my promise and Sarah was having a a hard time a man just simply believing the word amen she she failed to recognize the presence of God in her midst she she just thought that this was just another man a man and this man was speaking foolish things because she couldn't fulfill the promise she was an old woman a man she was she was going on her 90th birthday amen but you see when Elohim the word or the power of discernment through the word that can go to the very high Earth and divide between Soul and Spirit and go to what you're thinking amen what you're going through what Satan is trying to afflict you with the disease of unbelief and confusion and Amnesia amen but the word Elohim the son of man begin to say is there anything too hard for the Lord I say Elohim the son of man has come in this hour the word has divided between Soul and Spirit and he's here this morning and he's speaking the same word is there anything too hard for the Lord I don't care how long you've been going through the trial I don't care how much confusion and how much spiritual Amnesia we go through I don't care how much hardships but is there anything too hard for the Lord doesn't God know where the shot is if he's on The Honky Tonk Bar or whatever wherever three years is there anything too hard for the Lord can he reach down to the very mile of sin and lift him up and fill with the power of the Holy Ghost is there anything too hard for the Lord when Jesus said your name is engraved in the palm of my hand and I will not lose one he has swore by an old that he will keep you preserve you make sure you're in the Rapture is there anything to heart for the Lord can't you hear the words of Elohim speaking it can't you hear the son of man being revealed the son of man the word being opened and revealed is there anything too hard for the Lord you see God wants the church separated from all unbelief and and and there's many many quotes and you're taught on these things and so I'm not going to go through these quotes and scriptures because you're very much versed in them but God wants a separated he wants us purified that's the purpose of the word it's not just a letter it's not just an intellectual the word is the blood and the word became flesh and it was the blood of God the Creator blood cell that brought forth that word body and it was that body that died for your high breeding it was that word that flesh that died for your unbelief it was Thy word that was made manifest that declared it is finished that you can once and for all just simply say I believe when the devil says you're not a Believer but you're free to say I believe when all of everything else is gone against you the doctor's reports are against you the symptoms are against you the Mind battles are against you the devil's trying to get you to quit but yet you are free to Simply stand and say I believe not try to work it up not try to make it happen not try to produce something not try to manufacture something you have been liberated to just simply stand upon the word and say I am a believer no condemnation against your life How can there be condemnation to someone that has been made perfect by the blood of Jesus Christ you are loosed you are loose to believe you are free to just simply be a believer you are free to just simply say I am healed I am Holy Ghost I am going in the Rapture you are free it's a perfect loosing the blood that was made for us to die for your hybriding that died for your unbelief it's a perfect loosing once you're loose there's no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus that body was already judged on Calvary and the body of Christ you and I were in him and we have been judged in that body because we are only the physical manifestation of his thoughts before the foundation of the world that we were in Christ judged in that one sacrifice therefore it's a perfect loosing from all unbelief your mind wants to understand things but you're loosed you're loose from your mind your mind looks at symptoms and says how can it be but you're loosed you're free when you make a mistake and in your spirit you know there's memory and the devil's beating you up and trying to stir up those memories of your failures and your mistakes but you're loose I I hope you're understanding where I'm at you're loose from your thinking you're loose from your memories you're loose you're purged from the very conscience of sin the very desire of sin we're now dealing with your soul and your soul never doubted from the beginning but my mind but from the beginning it was not sure but but all of these things in my spirit I remember I know what I did the devil's reminding me but from the beginning it was the show he said but Jonathan what was in the beginning the words [Applause] [Music] Hallelujah you see it's God's will for you to be free loosed the Jubilee to loose us from everything that would hinder faith to bring us to an absolute a tight post of the Soul and that is the word a Thy Word nevertheless yes I've toiled I've done this I've done this I've done this I've been working I've been working I've tried I've tried I've tried but nevertheless on a Sunday morning after trying service after service after service after service after service after service nevertheless at Thy Word I've tried I've not got anything I've not received anything but nevertheless at that word I believe that changes everything you see Jesus left the church with a Great Commission I say that's a glorious thing a Great Commission to be his Representatives upon this Earth amen and these signs shall follow them that believe you see it's the scriptural identification of a believer these signs shall follow them that belief we don't need any scarecrows around it we don't need anyone to put this or that to it just simply say Lord I'm a Believer I just that's just that's a simple as we can get it Lord I believe these signs shall follow them that believe you see the prophet would say that he he Sanctified a church with his spirit and blood a church that he might make every promise in this last day be revealed now see he could go back and pick up what these other fellows has left off here in the last days and by his holy spirit reveal all the mystery of the Seven Seals he is expressing himself that's his purpose that's why he died that's the second fault of his threefold manifestation first to express himself in Christ and express himself through the church and the same thing Christ was the word now I want you to get this part now Christ was the word and the church becomes the word when it lets the word go through them you see again now let's go back to the beginning he Sanctified Sanctified is to be set apart for service he Sanctified he sent his church apart from all the world all unbelief and he Sanctified that a church that he might make every promise in this last day be revealed where is it being revealed to the believer through the believer you see he's expressing himself that's his purpose that's that's why he died and Jesus would say my word is spirit the prophet would pick that up my word is spirit see Anointed with the word when the but when the current is Flowing freely now the prophet would say Amen if the current is Flowing freely and it and it hits resistance or it hits something that it's gonna it's gonna blow a fuse if it grounds out and he says you know what what's happening is the word cannot flow freely through these denominationals amen and and they're teaching and their Creeds and and all of their all of their teachings is because they are teaching the people that God cannot do it they're teaching the people that we can only take so much of the word and so many parts of the word and therefore the current the power The Authority the anointing cannot fall freely but you see the church has been Sanctified the church has been set apart we are not a denomination he bet it's because God wants to flow his power freely through our lives amen come on come out of her my people come away from the lukewarmness come away from the denominational thinking come away from the theology amen but when the current is Flowing freely the word of God expresses itself The Works that I do shall ye be also and in the last days it shall come to pass behold I send you a lie to the prophet and he shall turn the hearts of the children back to the faith of the fathers and in there there would be a Time come forth when he could express himself in fullness of his godhead deity through his church have the preeminances in this church or my what the anointed man now the anointed people oh I love that amen what God did in Christ Christ is now doing through his church because it was God poured into Christ and now it's Christ poured into his bride to do what to express himself the anointed man now the anointed people to bring back the anointed bride in the bridegroom and he said brother Jonathan how do I how do I become anointed well the prophet answers that anointed by accepting what Eve turned down in Adam coming back with the anointing of the word because he said my word is spirit Anointed with the word oh it's a total different meaning then to hearing the word because you're not you're you're not just listening to a theory you're listening to God you're listening to an anointed word my words are spirit so we're Anointed with the word it's anointing our faith to believe you see the prophet would say like this they're crying for a messiah they're fasting they're praying they're they're doing all these things looking for a messiah he says we've got the Messiah it's the anointed word he's just looking for someone to anoint the word and make it live again how many believes he's the same yesterday today and forever you see the message has restored the faith the message has taught us to believe for all things [Music] you see the prophet would say like this as much as your faith will be released that's how much power you can have my in that mind-blowing as much as your faith will be released in other words as much as you can push beyond that unbelief barrier and just simply take God at his word as much as you can say I believe it and you begin to confess that promise and commit that word to a heart of faith and commit that promise to God and say Lord you promised it you promised it and you water that with praise and you water that with faith you you are releasing power created the world that created the universe that created the Sun that created Joy upon this Earth You Believe and release that Faith you're bringing a power of dominion and Authority supreme authority into your life [Applause] this ain't just the words of a Preacher this is supreme authority you see because in you dwells the power to make heavens and earth God dwells in you and your sons and daughters of God there you are but it's your faith Jesus said according to your faith be it unto you if thou can't believe all things are possible verily I say unto you if you say unto this mountain be moved and don't doubt but believe that what you have said it'll create squirrels it'll bring forth it'll bring forth Revival amongst lukewarmness it'll bring forth sons and daughters that are Wayward and lost and will bring them back as the family of God hallelujah amen but what believe what you have said then what kind of people on WE to be having faith in this great redeeming Christ that lives in us this smitten rock that never leaves the church I Am With You Always even to the end of the world the ever presence of the great gusher of Salvation and power that poured forth from Calvary into the church the ever presence of the Living God the great flowing spit and rock that goes with us in our journey now the prophet of God would say it like this the next thing he would say Israel lost her faith said they got off the path they began to Lust For The Flesh pots if they had stayed with faith and believing that God was taking going to take them to the land there would have been nothing hinder them they had already opened up Seas they had smoked planks upon their enemies they had crucified their enemies behind them and had walked over into the land and still couldn't have faith to go on to the promise Joshua and Caleb had that Faith they said we are more than able to conquer anything that would come before us do we have some joshuas and calebs amen we are more than able to conquer anything that would come before us and the prophet of God would say that's the trouble with the church we can conquer every disease we've got the power in us we are Sons and Daughters of God nothing can stand before us only thing he wants to find somebody who will believe it who will believe what God has already done for you did you hear the prophet believe what God has already done for you if he standing behind this desk this morning he couldn't heal you you're already healed he couldn't place a Rapture in you you're already raptured material amen he can't it's already finished not we will be we are now and the ever-living presence of the spirit is with us there you are I say he'll never leave us I say I say he will never forsake us I say nothing can separate us from the love of God nothing famine death Peril nakedness no trial no situation no symptoms no devil in hell can shake that Faith within our hearts we have the spirit of Christ we have the spirit of Faith therefore we speak it thine mouth where does your mouth speak from your heart where the Throne of God is and God by the Holy Ghost is sitting on the throne his throne you're his Dominion [Applause] a part of his domain and you are only carrying your orders carrying out the orders from the king king spirit King Holy Ghost King anointing supreme authority we therefore have the same faith and we speak it and we don't doubt it no devil in hell can shake us from it [Music] you see it's a it's got a it's got to be a hand of faith is this all right that hand of faith that depends on how strong it is this hand of Faith might just be strong enough to cut a little hole for the darkness and say by faith I'm saved that's a great cut but then if that's all the stronger that handy is to yield that sword that's all it can cut but if it's a strong hand that's what we want we want we we don't want to just settle for salvation we've got a Promised Land a geese worked a question look North look South but don't just sit there looking get up how do you get up Faith how do you get out of bed in the morning by faith how do you get dressed in the morning to come to church by faith how do you take the word and begin to walk through every Promise by faith that's mine that's mine that's mine that's mine that's mine and you take the that that hand of faith and you begin to cut it loose my inheritance oh yes sir it's a strong hand of Faith it'll come Plum through everything the devil can put out there make every promise of God shine forth in the power of his resurrection if it's a strong hand of Faith the days of Miracles Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever cut its way through it depends on the power of the hand behind the sword and again the prophet would say how can that uncircumcised enemy ever stand in the presence of the Eternal God that should be the seed of David amen that should be those anointed ones that know you're anointed to take down every Giant in this age what is that uncircumcised Philistine that uncircumcised demon amen that's trying to stand before me amen what is that in the presence of the Eternal God you take the sword of the word and every promise belongs to you pick it up in a strong head of Faith walk forward if you eat healing cut it out with the word Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever if you need salvation every promise in the Bible is yours it's laying back the back in there and Satan's trying to hide it but take the sword and push through the darkness until the light of God shines upon your soul and you have the promise he'll do it you see the prophet would say like this it says you've got to open every door the prophet of God would take take us through the door inside the door and he would say that there's a door called faith and there's people that are trying to bar that door put a padlock and say well you know it's for others but it's not for you in the days of Miracles has passed and God don't do those things any longer but you see the prophet of God says that you you you've just got to open that door and say Lord take over my faith tonight watch what will take place sure he will take over he will rule the thing when I read that I thought I'll praise the name of the Lord God rule my faith rule my faith so possess the reins of my heart that if there's anything that stands in the way of my faith you rule it you take my faith you control my faith and push it out there and let me be a rugged Christian let me be a real soldier of the cross let me not be spineless and and weak need but let me be courageous oh God take over my heart take over my faith rule my faith whenever a spirit tries to say well you can't believe that God ruled my faith when the devil tries to come and say well you've sent away your day of Grace oh God rule my faith when I have fallen for the umpteenth time but rule my faith to get me back up are you hearing me it's not you ruling your faith it's not you that is believing these things it's an eternal Gene of God that God has taken come supreme authority over your life and he's believing for thee for things that is not even humanly intelligently reasonable right man all right you see since the Holy Ghost has come Who is the dissolver of all doubts we have been released to believe things that Through the Ages people couldn't believe for these things that we are preaching about testifying of and we believe it you see we are not lukewarm layout of sins [Music] to be categorized as a lukewarm I may be the most the most prone to make mistakes and failures while walking out this Promised Land I may be the one amen that the devil I I I'm the least of all of you but I refuse to give in to a devil that's trying to weaken my faith and say that I can't possess it when he it's Christ that I'm reflecting it's Christ that I'm standing for it's Christ that I am expressing is Christ that I am a tabernacle of he's the dissolver of all doubts he's the one that taught me to believe he's the one that's pushing me out there and saying preach it preach it preach it there it is in the word there it is Vindicated there it is proven preach it I stand like the prophet said I don't know how when you got so many that isn't believing but all I know is it's gonna happen because God by his foreign knowledge predestinated because he saw believers you saw believers yes sir you see the prophet of God was saved the dissolver of doubts now the blood of Christ takes away each stain the stain of doubt [Music] no more stains nothing for the devil I'm not talking about your spirit I'm not talking about your mind I'm talking about a faith I'm talking about a conqueror I'm talking about a king I'm talking about supreme authority I'm talking about dominion over death hell and the grave I'm talking about when the devil tries to come up in your spirit there is a king that is rolling over your spirit and says Satan shut up there's no more stain it's putting the sea of forgetfulness in the mind of God you never ever did Sin in the mind of God there's not even a stench of sin in the mind of God you never fail you never made a mistake you are The Virtuous sinless Bride of the Lord Jesus Christ let that Faith rule over your life submit to the word speak the word live for the word live for this message [Music] ever since Christ has come to dissolve all doubts we're living in a different atmosphere it's an atmosphere of believing it's an atmosphere of expectation it's an atmosphere of worship through revelation you see it's a different atmosphere we're soaring higher in this astronaut age than any other time in the history of the world because it's a true atmosphere of faith and we are under the anointing of the Holy Ghost which is the latter the former and the latter rain falling together it is the teaching Lane and it is the the quickening power of the Holy Ghost that is falling upon your life to make this Word Flesh in you [Music] you see I love living in an atmosphere that Satan just can't stay in and come on we gotta live let's just put our let's just put what happened yesterday put it aside what happened what you're going through and the devil's trying to enter into your thoughts right now and say preacher what gives you the right to preach those kind of things why what gives you the right to say that I am living in an at that kind of an atmosphere right now I'm not talking about church I'm talking about Sons and Daughters of God who are now sitting in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus you say what gives you the right to say those things a Vindicated Prophet that preached this message and God himself the dissolver of doubts backed it up [Music] let me just get real simple even more simple you're saved when you don't feel like you're saved and if the and the prophet of God said that if the devil can get you to doubt that you're saved that very moment is when you're lost what do you mean yes that's what you see now what you hear not what you feel now your symptoms not want you what's going on here but it's by praise the Lord that's why I believe it was Peter maybe maybe it was John that said let's not be a forgetful hearer but let us heed to the words that we have been taught don't walk out the doors and just be a forgetful hearer but take it meditate ponder it believe it digest it all right am I taking too much time you see I I believe what I said in an age in the in the in the changing of dispensations the prophet of God it is the changing of the beat it's the changing of the Rhythm it's it's the changing of of dispensations and it's at that change oh hell is turn loose Hallelujah oh brother Jonathan oh yeah that's what you're facing all hell sometimes you feel like you can't even just get up in the morning all hell's against you sometimes it feels like you're just going to go through and you're going through Insanity all hell's against you true sometimes you're facing we're not just talking about one demon we're talking about demons upon demons on top of demons and they're all coming against you you say brother brother Jonathan it's pretty bleak well if you look at it that way it is Bleak but the prophet of God said when all hell is released Oh Heaven comes down that's why we've not left the scripture for greater is he that is in me into this world friends that's that's not something just say oh praise God no that's something to live by that's something when you get up in the morning and the devil's been tormenting your mind through dreams and and trying to trying to drag you down through circumstances you remind the devil you have the you have the faith to speak it Greater is he that is in me than he that is in the world how heaven is on what's happened we are living in Heavenly atmospheres oh an atmosphere where the devil can't stay spirits just start falling off let me repeat that again because I I want to Anchor That Into You because I'm talking about faith to hold on to God's promises living in an atmosphere the spirits that just fall off habits just start falling off pains just start breaking off amen mind your mind depression spirits that are trying to hold you captive but in this atmosphere the devil says I can't stay it's too hot we're not talking about hell hot we're talking about Holy Ghost Heart Holy Ghost Fire Holy Ghost baptism the heat of the atmosphere of the Holy Ghost that the devil says I don't have a chance to stay in that church service I don't have a chance to stay in that home I don't have a chance to stay in that car I've got to get out of here I've got to flee the place I've got to go somewhere welcome to God the atmosphere has changed the faith is restored the faith of the apostolic fathers is restored the faith of God to speak into this mountain be cast into the sea is restored you see by the mountain my brother-in-law send me a little a little video clip the other day and they say that they said there's just a little documentary and they say that the only thing that'll attack an eagle is a crow and that Crow will as that eagle is flying that Crow will get just just harass him starts flying on top of his back and starts pecking at him but they say the eagle never even worries about him never Frets never get scared doesn't get weary sorry oh my how am I going to get this Spirit off of me how am I going to live in overcoming Victorious Life that eagle knows who he is and that eagle by God's foreknowledge knows exactly who that Crow is that eagle knows that he has got something within him that take that can that can take him into those heavenly atmospheres there's something in intelligence it's a gene within him that gives him a perfect knowledge of his circumstance or did you hear me Church it is by the gene the sea Gene has given him a perfect knowledge of his circumstance [Music] I've got to go into that atmosphere that only I can live in and as he gets into those heavenly atmospheres the crow runs out of oxygen and the crow goes tumbling back down to the Earth he's an Earthbound bird but we are a Heavenly people higher higher the revealed wheel of God breaking over our lives and we're going higher higher higher how do we know it's because God placed an intelligence by the seed that we are born for those places foreign for those he's Earthbound hell is created for half for Satan and his angels [Music] are you tired of being tired then sore [Applause] [Music] are you tired of those mind battles getting you discouraged then soar into those heavenly places of the revealed word faith upon Faith hear a little very little it's the Holy Ghost bring a refreshing upon the children of the Lord and it's just a Revival the devil saying it's not now but it is now I know the devil's trying to point you to your circumstances and say how is this revival it is now it's not a natural man-made Revival it's a supernatural Eagle anointing Revival that only the message of the hour by the Holy Ghost will bring you into these atmospheres oh praise the name of the Lord you see you can have a canary oh vitamins but the prophet of God said what good is it what good is it to feed him all these vitamins if you're not going to let him fly what good is it to have a message oh you know I'm preaching what good is it to put these Full Gospel fall revealed word vitamins which the Full Gospel is nothing less than Jesus Christ and you're putting Christ in your life by a spirit-spoken word and it's the life of God by stimulation of Revelation that's pushing out in your life and then say now you got to be careful you don't want to be a fanatic you got to be careful we don't want to have we don't want anyone we don't want wildfire [Music] what good is the message of the hour if we can't step out in faith what good is the message of the hour if all we are looking at if all we are being treated as well they're babies they're babies they're babies we gotta watch out no we are mature Sons and Daughters of God we have been ripening in the presence of the Vindicated word of the hour it has placed a faith in my life I'll dare anyone let alone the laity but I'm part of you how dare anyone try to clip my wings and say you've got to be careful yeah well I'll just saying like this the prophet never did that the prophet of God actually did the opposite he said he said if I don't have the faith to go into places that others can he said I'm not going to hinder their faith if they can believe things in the word that I can't believe let them alone amen you see it's an eagle anointing I'm trying to wind it up anointing there's been there's this this is Revelations four stepping from laodicea Revelations 3 14 over into an Open Door an Open Door of lose the door Christ what is the seventh seal Christ what is the ministry of William Branham it was Christ coming in that Ministry opening the door the revelation of the word that we can go from this dispensation into Divine dispensation from an Earthbound creature of time to an Earthbound Eagle anointed son and daughter of God believing for all things out of this way out of Siege nothing but lukewarm make-believers I'm not anointed unbeliever I'm not an I'm not anointed to be a make-believer I'm not anointed to be lukewarm I'm anointed to be a red hot red hot desire of the Holy Ghost to do the will of God to do that which pleases him [Music] I'm a Believer you see brother Brethren would say we're looking into the Unseen rim by promise we're breaking through the unbelief barriers in the natural the Jed if it breaks through that sound barrier brother random says they say there's no limits to a speed and brother Brian says we've got to break through the unbelief barrier where there's no limit to our faith no limit to this astronaut age brother Jonathan I I'm I'm bumping into I'm I'm bumping into a barrier you got to break through it can I believe it can I break through it it's those are demonic Powers that's a real devil that's trying to keep you from your promises you've got to break through it you gotta stand on one thing and that is a believer of the word I believe it I believe it I believe it after a while you notice you're starting to bump into something else it's something that makes you excited it's something that begins to bring forth a happiness and a joy within your soul it's something that makes you want to lift your hands it's something that puts a dance in your step it's something that one said yeah hey hey that's the word I believe it that's what he's speaking over my life what are you doing you're breaking through the unbelief barrier and now you're bumping into another world another dimensioner you're bumping into the anointed presence of angels that I bring in the message from the Throne of God and he's saying come you gotta come you gotta you gotta walk over your circumstance you've got to do things that no one else has ever done you gotta be an overcomer foreign ER this is the age of the overcomer walk on it footsteps is possession walk over it amen walk on your sickness walk on your discouragement walk on your depression walk and live foreign [Applause] barrier walk on that despair that Spirit of depression that Spirit of depression is not to control you you're to control it one for the land once I don't see yeah it is under the under the feet of this bride has found the body we are putting everything under our feet [Applause] let me just say like this what what Christ did in symbol for him we are doing in reality for him did you hear me whatever he put in the Book of Revelations to the 10th chapter as a symbol form we are doing it in reality form because we have heard seven Thunders no longer in simple form but it's the voice of God saying come [Music] come possess this land put your feet on this thing put your feet on these symptoms in Heavenly places all right I'm trying my best it takes faith takes Faith to receive anything from God as your pastor is preaching these promises and I know how your pastor preaches and he's laying these promises in there it's going to take Faith it takes Faith to receive it it takes Faith through a minute because your mind is going how can that be how can that be but you see you are a different race of people [Music] this can't be preached out there they've already crucified it the only place this word will have effects is in faith and the prophet of God said we are free he predestinated Believers in this age to believe the word of the hour see you you gotta have faith will you make us whole if thou can't believe you see under that anointing all of a sudden a church service where the presence of the Lord is just sweeping you come up for prayers oh maybe maybe even just right where you're sitting said Lord I receive it I believe it and the devil says I I can't even withstand him I can't even stay here the presence of the Lord the atmosphere but you see you've got to have faith now are y'all still with me now I'm going to wind it down you you you've got to have faith to hold on [Music] you see let let's just go let's just break it down for just a minute I I've only got just a few minutes so stay with me I'm going to go fast Satan is a thief Satan is a scavenger he's looking to steal your victory oh praise the name of the Lord I dance in that church service the anointing of the Lord but the devil's a thief oh my that thing that had been haunting me and hounding me all of a sudden under the presence of the Lord oh my I haven't felt like that such Liberty and I he I know he went out those doors as whether Andrew would say open those back doors the devil's fleeing let's get him out of here but he knows your address yeah he knows where you live he's been studying you for a long time oh Satan's a thief he's going to try to steal your victory he's going to try to steal your healing I know I was healed Satan's gonna try to steal it he's going to try to steal your joy he's going to try to steal your peace he's going to try to steal your Revival he's going to try to take your contentment away from you he's going to try to steal your purpose for a living the purpose for believing this message the purpose why God called you in the first place you see he's a thief we could just keep going through things but he's also a liar he'll say you don't have the Holy Ghost when you knew you testified you stood there and you said I know God filled me with the Holy Ghost but the devil will come right back around and say now you know all you had was just a little bit of an emotional workup he'll try to tell you you don't have the Holy Ghost you know what the devil do he'll try to take your symptoms you'll stand there and say I buy his stripes I am healed and then he'll make those symptoms flare up and their those symptoms will be greater worse than ever before that's why the prophet of God said symptoms are lying vanities you say Where's that in the scripture Jonah running from the presence of the Lord Jonah trying to get away from the will of God Jonah yet in right there in the will of God and all he could see was Wells belly Wells belly Wells belly seaweed vomit stench and yet he looked at that and says it's lying vanities and he looked to the promise and he prayed and he knew that God heard his prayer [Music] right Satan's a murderer the very moment the Revelation strikes your heart there's going to be there's going to be serpent a serpent seed there's going to be there's going to be the devil trying to take that kill that revelation sure he'll try to kill Revival he'll try to kill expectation he'll try to kill the move of God he'll try to kill conviction kill Joy kill the thrill of serving God he'll afflict you with mistakes he'll afflict you at complexes he'll try to put scars in your life for one purpose and that is to try to defeat the purpose of God in your life he'll try to reason us out of the promises of God but the prophet says you have to fight to possess what you know is your own [Music] that's the way God's got to set up you have to fight to possess what you know is your own you see Satan's going to constantly punch at you until you're finished here on Earth this is quote Satan will constantly punch at you until you're finished here on Earth just remember that amen you see the prophet would take us to Elijah and I I'm trying to close but I I I I want you to just to hear this I'm gonna I want to close on this I want this I want this to show just ingraining your heart here because remember Elijah by the voice of God by the will of God he went to Mount Carmel for a showdown to prove that God is God and that great anointing that great move of God Amen Baal was destroyed amen I think it was 400 450 amen and false prophets amen were destroyed and then we find that Elijah when the anointing has left him is running for his life because of the threat of one woman the prophet of God says that we find that Elijah is under a juniper tree wishing that he would just die the day before the day before he was shouting dancing the Living God made manifest and it was all real and it was all true and it was all Victory there was nothing fake about it there was no emotional workup about it it was nothing but the truth and it was the will of God for Elijah to do what he did and now the next day he's come down from the anointing I want to tell you nothing's changed the word didn't change there were seven thousand elect that still believed the word still believed the message that we're still holding to Elijah's message but Elijah himself was saying now that the anointing has left him I'm alone just take my life I'm a failure the prophet of God was saying pastor here knows and other ministers watch after your Mount carmels you're going to have a juniper tree whenever a man has a blessing and the power of God Pours Down and does something for you look out Satan is on the track just remember the next day that Monday after a good day on Sunday it's going to be a hard thing because he's going to do everything he can to knock that confidence out of you that the Holy Spirit instilled in you the day before can we say Amen ministers but the prophet of God didn't just leave it for ministers the prophet went on to say and we each one of us have our juniper trees you see when God does something you can't start looking around at the water you can't start looking around at the waves you can't start you can't start questioning how did I get here why did I step out in faith I I was obeying the word but now look there's 30 foot waves there's there's there I I'm gonna sing you cannot get place you have got to guard your heart with the anointing you don't feel anointed anymore you don't feel like dancing anymore you don't feel like you even receive the promise you've got to hold to the word you gotta stand there and you gotta walk it whether you feel it you are doing it by faith if it Be You Lord if you have stepped into this age if this is the dispensation of the Overcomer bid me come come you got here by the word you got here by the promise and you're going to have to get to the Finish by the same I'm going through a lot of things because the prophet of God said when Peter said Jesus said come come on he says that in perfect Faith he says now come on now that's just the same as James 5 14 the same as Mark 16. the same God said it come on Lord I need healing and God says come on I need the Holy Ghost come on I want to make the Rapture come on I want to be an overcomer in this age come on but we're the ones Jesus stays the same he stays constant his word is unchanging we're the ones that get to looking around us the words not changed you're gonna when you accept that word you're going to have to fight harder than you have ever fought in your life hello all right you see the prophet says it like this I'm going to just read a few things and then I'm closing thank you see the prophet says to get the difference between what is the spirit of God and what is the spirit of the devil are y'all are y'all still with me and then by the atonement in Calvary that devil is cast out and I'll assure you if the believer will come and believe right here presently no matter what's wrong with it it'll take place right here that's right you've never seen it fail and it won't but now if you go out of here in disbelief or just with a little weak Faith it'll come right back on you even worse than what it was in the first place for the unclean Spirit goes out of a man he walks in dry places is that right then he returns back and if the good man of the house isn't there to keep him away you must take God at his word not your feelings take God at his word your faith keeps him away [Applause] your faith keeps him away just refuse it here it is I want you to listen to this he will torment and pack at your door and hot at your windows let me read it again he will torment get your door hot at your windows but just turn your head and keep looking forward towards Christ and going on [Music] oh brother brother Sean I I was shouting the victory I was rejoicing I knew that God did it I I stood upon it yeah yeah that that's right and nothing's changed but now I don't feel it now I can't even I can't even barely lift my hands I feel so condemned I feel like the joy is taken out of my heart I feel like I could barely even make it to church it's because the devil's the theme the devil's trying to steal what God did for you at cap what God did for you in the Revival what God did for you on Sunday what he did for you on Wednesday what he did for you in your car or at your house or at your prayer meeting oh brother Jonathan oh I felt the anointing and all of a sudden I was just released yep you were that's not the time to go on vacation that's the time to fill up with the word that's the time to say to the Lord just fill me with your presence fill me with faith muscles because I know he's going to come back I know he's going to try to enter in again I know he's going to try to say I don't have the Holy Ghost I know he's going to try to take my peace away from me I know that Spirit of depression is going to try to take over my mind again you've got to stand there and say Satan no more this is not your house this is the house of faith this is the strong man standing at the door grabbing that old spineless demon and kicking him back away from you and say get away from me I am free from you is this all right the prophet of God says you hear me sure you do you hear me now I told you you were healed sister don't doubt me you are healed aren't you see you can hear all right your female troubles gone too your nervousness has left you hadn't heard for years say praise the Lord the lady says praise the Lord go off the platform shouting foreign don't doubt if you doubt it'll come back on you again don't do that believe have faith in God again the prophet of God says when that enemy leaves you and then you go away and let somebody talk you out of it a little pain hit you and say well maybe it wasn't so brother are worse things coming you stand like the Rock of Ages and claim the power of the Lord Jesus Christ be healed and you shall receive what you've asked for again the prophet of God would say it like this he says under that anointing he says it's left you said but I can't keep it away from you it's your faith it's your faith you see the prophet would say like this as the musicians come it says you he says the greatest power is a committal he said you the farmer takes that seed and puts it in the ground and then he doesn't come back day after day after day digging it up seeing if there's any process seeing if there's anything happening he just commits it to the ground and leaves it alone and he goes forth just believing and praising the Lord because he knows the seed there's a law within the seed it will bring forth said he says that's the way we do we just committed to God and he says and when the seed has fallen into your heart and you'll water that seed by faith believing it'll bring forth just after it's kind brother random again he says we just have to take God's word for it and start rejoicing have you noticed in the prayer line I looked it up the other day in just hundreds of times each time brother Brandon would say go shouting go rejoicing go praising God just tape after tape brother Branham would say discernment and say you're healed then he would turn to the audience and say let's say praise the Lord then he would turn to another one and say elk you're healed and he would turn again to the audience and say let's let's just say thank you Jesus and then he would turn around and he would say okay you're healed you got this premature healed it turned right back around to the audience and let's say and let's just say hallelujah what was he doing this is what I believe he was teaching us to praise the Lord the water the word with faith he was teaching the audience how to receive what God is doing in the people's lives don't just be a spectator give him praise let's say hallelujah let's Rejoice let us give honor to him who is doing everything to end according to his word and his will [Music] but then he would give instruction that wasn't just a preacher giving instruction that was a prophet that was saying go rejoicing [Music] and then he would turn to the audience when people were getting really excited he would turn around to the audience and say now that might bother some he said but the reason they're getting excited is because God just did something in their lives and they're shouting and screaming and rejoicing and you can hear you can barely even hear Brother Branham but it didn't even bother him a bit it's because he's teaching us if you're going to reach it's to receive it when you're under that anointing that's only part of it but maintaining that when you don't feel the anointing and you're not with the church people and the church service and the musicians and everything came together so perfect and then all of a sudden God spoke that's just you just received it now you gotta keep it no hell is going to try to steal it away from you and you may have this fortified but what about this and this and this and this and this and this because the devil's a sore loser I'm sorry but we're going to have to rest in on the other side this is the not the time to rest I wish it was this is the time it's just we're fighting all hell [Music] brother Brandon say like this if you can receive God's word in your heart and water it with praises and thanks to God for giving it to you it'll grow you love him Hallelujah [Music] Elijah had his juniper tree but God never came along and rebuked him for it what God did said my tired servant he needs some food and I'm so glad that God fed him and put him into a cave the whole time was just giving him rest [Music] the fire came this came the lightning the thunder came but it never moved Elijah he said there's only one thing that I want and that is to hear the word of the Lord and when God spoke Elijah stepped forth and said here I am friends God has given us food he's given us rest but oh when God comes and just speaks to our hearts how many believe that God still speaks how many believes that God takes this same word this same Revelation this same Vindicated word and just gives fresh anointing and fresh Revelation and fresh inspiration and she speaks and speaks that speaks and it's as if we heard it for the first time and it just encourages our faith Elijah you're not alone Elijah you gotta keep fighting I'm thankful for what God did for and you know some of you young people were there at camp I've heard great testimonies brother brother Wendell's camp I mean I I I Rejoice I I mean wonderful y'all's tent meeting just your your
