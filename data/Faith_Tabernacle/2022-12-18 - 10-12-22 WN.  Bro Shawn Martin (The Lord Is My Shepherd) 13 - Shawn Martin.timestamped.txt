[0:20] Lord which

[1:21] bow our heads and ask our lord for his
[1:24] help Father
[1:28] we know that you've redeemed us you've
[1:30] called us Lord and
[1:33] we're so privileged Lord to be called

[1:50] Lord just to feed off your word
[1:53] Lord we know that you desire to meet
[1:56] with us

[2:04] that you could speak through them to

[2:08] and father I just pray Lord that you

[2:16] of the way and that you would just speak

[2:25] ear to hear and receive of you
[2:28] father for we we want to be better
[2:31] Christians we we want to know more about

[2:37] quickened within us
[2:39] father if there's anything that we have
[2:41] done wrong any sins in our life we ask
[2:44] that you would forgive us for them
[2:46] father may your blood just cover us Lord
[2:49] and may you just feel free to to move
[2:53] Among Us and Lord in a supernatural way
[2:57] we ask these things in your lovely name
[3:00] Jesus Christ and the church says amen
[3:04] amen
[3:07] Psalms the 23rd chapter
[3:10] it says the Lord is my shepherd
[3:14] I shall not want.
[3:16] he maketh me to lie down in Green
[3:19] Pastures he leadeth me beside the Still
[3:22] Waters
[3:23] he restoreth my soul
[3:27] you can have your seats I'm just going
[3:29] to stop there we
[3:31] 've been on this chapter for
[3:34] for a while
[3:36] now and
[3:38] um I'd like to just continue on it and
[3:42] speaking
[3:43] of this third verse he restoreth my soul
[3:48] and
[3:50] um you know as we've said if if the Lord
[3:53] if the Lord is my shepherd then I am a
[3:56] sheep
[3:58] and and David lets us know that it's the
[4:01] Lord that is doing the leading
[4:04] and that we are doing the following he's
[4:09] the shepherd we're the sheep and David
[4:12] said he leadeth me and so this is a sign
[4:17] that we are his sheep
[4:19] is because we follow the shepherd
[4:22] and he's the leader we're the follower
[4:25] and Jesus said my sheep hear my voice or
[4:30] or know my voice and so the shepherd
[4:34] leads by his voice in any man's voice is
[4:38] his word
[4:39] so then the voice of God is the word of
[4:42] God
[4:43] that's that's the that's how he leads
[4:46] his people and and the the voice of God
[4:50] the prophet said the voice of God will
[4:52] only vindicate the word of God
[4:56] so the voice of God is is not something
[4:59] that's so far-fetched out there that you
[5:03] can't find it in the word but it
[5:05] actually vindicates the word of God
[5:08] and and so when when Moses for example
[5:12] met the pillar fire at the burning bush
[5:15] it had a voice in it and that voice came
[5:18] came from that fire from that bush and
[5:21] and it began to uh vindicate the word it
[5:26] it that that had been prophesied and
[5:29] brother Branham said see that pillar
[5:31] fire spoke the word and Vindicated it to
[5:35] make it show that he's quoted the
[5:38] scriptures see so so uh uh it began to
[5:43] remind Moses of the prophecy that was
[5:46] given to Abraham uh uh many years back
[5:51] and and so it it it it it began to relay
[5:55] this to to Moses and and Moses received
[6:00] the Revelation when he heard God's voice
[6:03] any sheep will hear uh receive
[6:06] Revelation when they hear the voice of
[6:08] God God Amen and and the Revelation that
[6:13] that Moses got was prophecy for his
[6:16] present day
[6:18] if you notice God wasn't just God didn't
[6:20] just the voice didn't just start
[6:22] speaking of Noah it didn't just start
[6:25] speaking of Adam and Eve it it it it
[6:28] began to take the prophecy that was
[6:31] spoken amen and and relay it to his day
[6:35] that he was living in ain't that right
[6:39] and and so uh we we find that the voice
[6:43] of God brought the spoken word to life
[6:46] and it's the same voice that is leading
[6:49] us today it it brings to light the
[6:53] prophecy that speaks of the Bride
[6:56] um uh uh throughout the scriptures for
[7:00] our day and age that we live in and and
[7:04] I I have to say we've heard the voice of
[7:06] God in this day do you believe that we
[7:10] we've heard the voice of God and and
[7:12] this voice of God that we've heard has
[7:15] Vindicated everything that has been
[7:18] prophesied for this day amen and we
[7:22] received the Revelation as Moses has a
[7:27] man at Moses received that Revelation
[7:29] and that Revelation let him know that he
[7:33] was part of the prophecy amen he was
[7:37] part of the prophecy ain't that right
[7:39] Moses didn't just hear the voice out of
[7:41] the Bush amen and then just leave amen
[7:45] wondering what was happening and what
[7:47] was going on in his day and what was he
[7:49] supposed to do amen but the voice of God
[7:52] made it clear that he was part of the
[7:55] prophecy that was given ain't that right
[7:58] amen and so we've received that
[8:01] Revelation that all the scriptures that
[8:04] speak of our day now we would have never
[8:07] known amen what our day was we would
[8:09] have never known that the prophecies
[8:11] were spoken of this day had we not heard
[8:14] the voice of God Amen and and as Moses
[8:18] was you know as far as Moses was
[8:21] concerned he had no purpose he had no he
[8:23] hadn't he had nothing there he was out
[8:25] in the wilderness right hiding from
[8:27] pharaoh and and and trying to start a
[8:29] new life and all of that but God knew
[8:32] God knew that the day had come for the
[8:36] prophecy to be fulfilled and Moses was
[8:39] part of it ain't that right amen and so
[8:42] we've received that Revelation you know
[8:44] Revelations 4 1 has been laying there
[8:47] for years and years as a prophecy but
[8:51] we've heard the voice of God that would
[8:54] tell us that that scripture is for us
[8:57] today it it is it is it is for today a
[9:01] man and the Revelation that we have
[9:03] received is that we're part of that uh
[9:06] prophecy first Thessalonians 4 16-17
[9:10] Romans the eighth chapter and even
[9:13] Matthew 25 speaking there of the voice
[9:17] of the bridegroom room and and and so
[9:20] many more scriptures that that that were
[9:23] because of the voice of God Amen that
[9:27] has spoken we have received a revelation
[9:30] that we're not just the the average call
[9:34] in in the age that we're living in and
[9:36] we're not just wandering living life uh
[9:40] uh you know uh just just uh
[9:43] half-heartedly or whatever and doing
[9:45] what we want to do and and and then we
[9:48] just die but we found that we have a
[9:51] purpose in life can you say amen amen so
[9:55] these Pro scriptures and and prophecies
[9:58] are uh that are being fulfilled today
[10:01] amen the story of Ruth the story of
[10:04] Esther where prophecies for this day the
[10:07] creation of Adam and Eve was prophecy
[10:10] for this day the story of the shunamite
[10:14] woman a man was prophecy for this day
[10:16] ain't that right and and the voice of
[10:19] God has has made these things known to
[10:23] us that it's more than just the story
[10:25] amen it's more than just a history but
[10:29] God was prophesying through their lives
[10:32] speaking of a day to come amen and we
[10:35] find out that the voice a man the
[10:38] Revelation that we have received is for
[10:40] this day ain't that right amen so so we
[10:44] can look and and and uh uh we are in the
[10:49] word for our day amen that's right
[10:52] that's the script written for us a man
[10:55] in Green Pastures ain't that right a man
[10:58] in Green Pastures we know our place in
[11:01] the word and and if you notice the voice
[11:04] of God commissioned Moses to Gold a man
[11:08] so when he left that that bush and he
[11:11] after he had heard the voice of God he
[11:13] knew his commission he knew what he was
[11:17] to do he he knew can you say amen he
[11:20] knew that the word was going to be
[11:22] fulfilled through him he knew that God
[11:25] was with him he knew these things ain't
[11:29] that right amen and that same voice has
[11:32] commissioned this end time bride amen
[11:35] and she is following the voice of God
[11:39] Amen she's following the shepherd ain't
[11:42] that right amen you see God a man wants
[11:46] to lead man he wants to lead man that
[11:48] that's that's that's the thing he he uh
[11:51] that's what he desires colossian uh 1 18
[11:55] it says he Christ is the head of the
[11:59] body the church who is the beginning the
[12:03] firstborn from the dead that in all
[12:06] things everybody's saying all things he
[12:09] might have the preeminence and so if you
[12:13] are part of the body of Christ amen the
[12:16] Church of the Living God then God is
[12:19] going to have the preeminence in you
[12:21] amen he's going to have the preeminence
[12:23] in all things now we find that the vast
[12:27] majority of people today amen they
[12:29] follow after things that suit them best
[12:31] amen depict the church that suits them
[12:34] best they picked a religion that suits
[12:36] them best amen they they pick a job that
[12:39] suits them best they they they it's it's
[12:42] it's it's people's right People's Choice
[12:44] and and the thing is they don't give the
[12:48] word of God any consideration at all
[12:52] they they've not listened to the voice
[12:54] of God which shows a man that the Lord
[12:58] is not their Shepherd amen because the
[13:02] voice comes from the word of God Amen it
[13:05] it vindicates the word of God only ain't
[13:08] that right amen and and but yet uh uh uh
[13:13] uh uh so so we find that the the Lord is
[13:17] not their Shepherd word amen and
[13:19] therefore the word of God is dead to
[13:22] them amen think of that the word of God
[13:25] is dead to them the word of God was dead
[13:27] Amen to Moses until he heard the voice
[13:31] of God Amen uh uh uh maybe he he
[13:35] understood the quote or the prophecies
[13:38] and things that and heard about it and
[13:40] yes his mom had probably told him amen
[13:43] that you're the one Moses you're you're
[13:45] the one but after he tried it and he
[13:48] failed amen he he you know he's in the
[13:51] backside of the desert he ain't got no
[13:53] desire to fulfill prophecy he ain't got
[13:55] no desire Amen to deliver the children
[13:58] of Israel amen he ain't got no desire
[14:01] whatsoever amen he failed the first time
[14:03] ain't that right but once he heard the
[14:06] voice of God though promise became
[14:09] quickened unto him amen that's right see
[14:13] and if if uh uh uh the world would just
[14:17] hear the voice of God if they would have
[14:19] heard it amen but they didn't hear it
[14:22] they didn't want to hear it a man so
[14:24] they're doing exactly what the Bible
[14:27] said they would do walking after their
[14:29] own lust a man heaping unto themselves
[14:31] teachers having itching ears giving heed
[14:35] to seducing spirits and and doctrines of
[14:39] devils you realize that's all uh what
[14:42] what uh the prophecy was for this day of
[14:44] the world Amen see that they would do
[14:47] these things but the Sheep amen sheep
[14:50] are born under the tudorship of their
[14:53] Shepherd hey ain't that right amen he
[14:56] learns that sheep learns the voice of
[15:00] its Shepherd a man to wear that it it it
[15:04] will not follow any other voice amen it
[15:08] doesn't go after any other uh uh uh
[15:10] strange well Jesus in speaking of his
[15:14] sheep said a stranger they will not
[15:17] follow oh ain't that right a stranger
[15:20] they will not follow and you see a
[15:23] strange voice is one who speaks outside
[15:27] the word of God Amen that's right see
[15:30] and so there are many strange voices
[15:33] today oh yes they they'll get the word
[15:36] and they open the Bible up at how many
[15:39] interpretations do we have out of this
[15:41] Bible that has never been Vindicated by
[15:44] God whatsoever amen see and so many
[15:47] ideas and and traditions and
[15:50] interpretations and and all of these
[15:53] things and it's led the people away amen
[15:56] into foodless pastures amen that's right
[15:59] and the people are spiritually dead
[16:01] there is no Supernatural moving in their
[16:04] lives they don't even know what the
[16:05] Supernatural is all they know is their
[16:07] Church Dogma all they know is their
[16:09] Church programs all they know is their
[16:11] Church up uh uh ideologies or whatever
[16:14] see but but we fine now if you notice
[16:18] David said he maketh me to lie down in
[16:22] Green Pastures now that we know as we
[16:25] talked about it the Green Pastures is
[16:27] where the abundance of food is a man and
[16:31] food sustains life ain't that right a
[16:34] man and the pastures are green which
[16:37] shows that there is life ain't that
[16:40] right so the green pastors ain't
[16:42] denominations amen the prophet called
[16:44] him foodless pastors amen
[16:47] the people are dead can you say Amen the
[16:50] church is dead the denominations are
[16:53] dead amen go study your history amen if
[16:56] you really want to know you know people
[16:57] get criticized or get critical amen
[17:00] because we talk about denominations amen
[17:02] but let me tell you something if you'll
[17:04] study your history amen the Methodist
[17:06] used to be on fire for God they used to
[17:09] have the supernatural power of God they
[17:12] used to have the anointing of God Amen
[17:14] the lutherans had the power of God Amen
[17:17] to you to have the anointing of God they
[17:20] used to have the words for their age but
[17:22] but when they began to organize and
[17:25] teach darkness and traditions and and
[17:28] would not go any further they're sitting
[17:31] dead today allowing homosexuals behind
[17:33] their pulpits and and married uh uh
[17:36] deacons married two or three four times
[17:38] you know and and all of these things
[17:40] they've thrown away the Bible amen and
[17:43] accepted denominational ideas which all
[17:47] stems from the Catholic church and so
[17:50] the people even though religious they
[17:52] got baseball on their minds more than
[17:55] they do God Amen they got Sports on
[17:57] their mind more than they do God they
[18:00] got movies on their mind more than they
[18:02] do God instead of listen the good
[18:04] wholesome Godly music now they're
[18:06] bringing in the rock and roll and
[18:07] they're bringing in the country and and
[18:09] nobody you know I I've I've I've I've uh
[18:13] worked out with pastors and gyms amen
[18:16] and they're talking about rated our moon
[18:17] movies and and and uh that they've
[18:20] watched and going to rock concerts
[18:22] pastors that would feed their people the
[18:25] word of God Amen gone to rock and roll
[18:28] concerts amen oh my how degraded can you
[18:32] say amen amen it's foodless pastors amen
[18:35] but here we find that the psalmist said
[18:38] he he maketh me to lie down in Green
[18:41] Pastures he leads me beside the Still
[18:45] Waters water speaks of life as well
[18:48] eternal life can you say man amen so the
[18:51] Lord my shepherd the Lord Our Shepherd
[18:55] leads us to life and not death ain't
[18:59] that right he'll never lead his Sheep
[19:01] amen to the place where they're
[19:03] spiritually dead
[19:06] it's true amen that's right our Shepherd
[19:09] never leads us to the place to where we
[19:11] are spiritually starving and spiritually
[19:14] famished and parched you know the Bible
[19:17] says there in Romans 6 23 at the wages
[19:20] of sin is death ain't that right I just
[19:24] tell you he doesn't lead us to the barn
[19:26] room
[19:27] Our Shepherd doesn't lead us Amen to
[19:30] ungodly places
[19:31] he doesn't lead us to the movie houses
[19:33] he doesn't lead us to the places you
[19:36] know amen he doesn't lead us the
[19:38] denominations again foodless pastors
[19:41] that's what the prophet called them
[19:43] Vindicated right he never leads me to a
[19:46] place where I'll sit there and deny his
[19:49] word
[19:50] he he ain't going to lead us to them
[19:52] places because the wages of sin is death
[19:56] can you say Amen so we find that that
[19:59] David you know uh is saying the Lord is
[20:03] Our Shepherd and and he tells us that he
[20:06] is following the shepherd for he said he
[20:08] leadeth me he leads me we're not Cowboys
[20:12] and Rodeo here amen that that's not the
[20:14] way of Christianity he leadeth me can
[20:18] you say Amen don't have to have a rope
[20:20] on him and pulling him and dragging him
[20:22] and and the Sheep just pulling away no
[20:25] he just leads by his voice and we follow
[20:29] now now church not everybody can follow
[20:32] the lord
[20:34] not everyone can accept his leadership
[20:36] because he only leads by his word that's
[20:40] his voice can you say man now Peter said
[20:43] they would deny the Lord that bought
[20:45] them
[20:47] deny him the right to lead them to to
[20:50] leadership can you say amen amen see so
[20:54] they see the word of God Vindicated for
[20:57] this day and they walk away from it you
[21:00] know what the Bible identifies them as
[21:01] being children of disobedience
[21:05] children of Disobedience ain't that
[21:07] right now notice as as we go on now amen
[21:11] David gives the answer as to why he is
[21:14] different from the millions of people in
[21:17] the world and why we are different amen
[21:20] and I say we not just fake Tabernacle
[21:23] amen but and and not just everybody in
[21:26] the message either amen amen there's a
[21:29] lot of people in the messes that that
[21:30] the Lord ain't their Shepherd can you
[21:33] say amen amen but but I will say all the
[21:36] Sheep will be in the message amen amen
[21:39] that's just Vindicated word of the hour
[21:40] ain't that right amen but but we find
[21:43] amen the reason that makes us different
[21:46] is he restoreth my soul
[21:50] my soul is restored ain't that right
[21:54] amen now now we find a man David
[21:59] um this shows that David is a Believer
[22:01] amen his soul is restored now now we
[22:05] find in Ezekiel uh uh 18 and 20. it says
[22:09] the soul that sinneth it shall die
[22:13] ain't that right the soul that's sinneth
[22:16] it shall die amen ain't speaking of
[22:19] restoration it's speaking of death
[22:22] but David is saying he restoreth my soul
[22:26] ain't that right now we find by the
[22:29] message of the hour that the only sin
[22:32] there is
[22:33] unbelief
[22:35] ain't that right adultery is not sin
[22:38] it's the attribute
[22:41] of sin
[22:43] it's the attribute of unbelief smoking
[22:46] cigarettes it's an attribute
[22:49] of unbelief
[22:50] ain't that right amen hate is an
[22:54] attribute of unbelief you could go on
[22:57] and on and on but there's really one sin
[22:59] and that's unbelief so the soul that
[23:03] disbelieth
[23:05] shall die
[23:07] ain't that right the soul that
[23:10] disbelieves shall die so we we find that
[23:14] every believer then experiences what
[23:17] David is talking about he restoreth my
[23:20] soul as we talked the last time we spoke
[23:23] on this that a soul is worth ten
[23:26] thousand worlds
[23:28] amen a soul is priceless the soul of a
[23:32] man and but we put all the emphasis on
[23:35] the flesh
[23:36] and and yet it's it's what you are in
[23:40] your soul that really counts
[23:43] amen see we we get the the the ox cart
[23:46] and the horse backwards you know we put
[23:49] the the cart before the horse but see
[23:52] it's the soul the soul is the place
[23:55] where you live
[23:56] now I know most of us know this but I'm
[23:59] going to go through it again amen man is
[24:02] a Triune being
[24:03] he is body
[24:05] spirit and soul ain't that right amen
[24:10] see the number three amen the prophet
[24:13] tells us is the number of perfection it
[24:16] takes three elements to bring a birth
[24:17] water blood spirit ain't that right
[24:21] there's three works of Grace
[24:24] justification sanctification the baptism
[24:27] of the Holy Ghost and according to first
[24:31] Thessalonians 4 16 there are three
[24:34] things that involve the coming of the
[24:37] Lord ain't that right amen he says Paul
[24:40] said the Lord himself shall descend with
[24:43] the shout a voice the voice of the
[24:46] Archangel and with the Trump of God
[24:48] three things ain't that right amen that
[24:51] make up a Rapture amen see so we find
[24:55] also that God is perfected in three he
[24:59] is a trinity or he in a trinity is one
[25:03] ain't that right father their Son and
[25:07] Holy Ghost makes one God not three Gods
[25:11] one God ain't that right and the prophet
[25:14] said he cannot be manifested any other
[25:16] way see they say that the star that that
[25:19] led the wise men to Jesus you know they
[25:22] they say that it was three stars made
[25:25] into one star a man formed came together
[25:28] and made one star you know and the
[25:31] prophet said it showed that the Trinity
[25:35] of God was made manifest in one man
[25:38] Jesus Christ the fullness of the godhead
[25:43] came in Jesus Christ ain't that right we
[25:46] also find in the wilderness in Moses's
[25:49] Tabernacle there was only one Tabernacle
[25:52] but there were three courts there was
[25:54] the outer Court the inner court and the
[25:57] holy place or the holiest of holy ain't
[26:00] that right and all three made up one
[26:03] Tabernacle so then we look at man body
[26:07] spirit and soul makes one man you cannot
[26:11] be manifested without being the Trinity
[26:14] person that you are
[26:17] can you say Amen you can't be manifested
[26:20] just as a body can be manifested just as
[26:23] a spirit can't be manifested just as a
[26:26] soul yeah it takes all three
[26:30] ain't that right so we we find that that
[26:34] the body of course is the outer layer it
[26:37] this is the old flesh
[26:39] and it has five inlets Stacy smell here
[26:43] and and uh a touch I I believe and and
[26:47] so uh without these senses you cannot
[26:50] touch the body amen you you can't get in
[26:54] uh in other words it's the only way to
[26:56] the body and the prophet would tell us
[26:59] this old outside is the evil one ain't
[27:02] that right then then you've got in
[27:05] inside of the body you've got the spirit
[27:07] that's the next thing amen and it has
[27:11] five inlets it has imagination it has
[27:14] conscience um memory uh reasoning again
[27:18] affection I believe it is amen and and
[27:22] and so that is the spirit amen but
[27:24] inside of the inside the the the core of
[27:29] it all is the soul that now that's
[27:32] that's you a man the soul and and uh
[27:36] that's the inside of the inside and the
[27:39] problem outfit tells us there's only one
[27:41] gate to that one and that's free moral
[27:44] agency ain't that right you you uh uh
[27:48] you know you can refuse or you can
[27:51] receive and it's either controlled by
[27:53] faith or doubt
[27:55] ain't that right so you've got five
[27:58] inlets to the body five inlets to the
[28:01] spirit but one Inlet free moral agency
[28:04] whether you where you have the right to
[28:07] choose or to reject Faith or doubt ain't
[28:11] that right and that is in your soul now
[28:14] you know I I want to say this a
[28:17] Christian is not a Christian in the
[28:19] flesh
[28:20] a Christian is not a Christian in his
[28:23] spirit
[28:25] a Christian is a believer in his soul
[28:31] ain't that right
[28:33] see it's the soul is what is
[28:35] predestinated
[28:37] now just bear with me as we go on but we
[28:41] we find that the difference between the
[28:43] animal and man is that the animal has no
[28:46] soul
[28:47] some things we've we've already talked
[28:49] about but I'm just reiterating it uh
[28:51] there but the the the animal has no soul
[28:55] uh it it has life in its body but it has
[28:59] no soul in the life ain't that right you
[29:03] know it it has not the intelligence the
[29:06] prophet tells us uh uh that man has see
[29:09] it doesn't know that he's naked it
[29:11] doesn't realize a man that uh what sin
[29:15] is because it has no soul a man see but
[29:19] man has life and he has a soul in that
[29:25] life
[29:27] amen now Genesis 2 and 7 and the Lord
[29:32] God formed Man Out of the Dust of the
[29:35] ground and breathe into his nostrils the
[29:39] breath of life and Man became a living
[29:43] soul
[29:44] did you know the soul is the nature of
[29:47] the life
[29:49] amen that's what the prophet said in
[29:51] others are several places he also says
[29:54] that the soul is the nature of the
[29:56] spirit
[29:57] he said it's the soul that controls the
[30:01] spirit and the spirit controls the body
[30:06] now I I thank God for a prophet because
[30:08] we would never know these things
[30:11] amen say we would never know and
[30:13] understand in that spiritual realm amen
[30:16] what's really going on but the soul
[30:18] controls the spirit and the spirit
[30:21] controls the body ain't that right so
[30:24] when man sinned he became degenerate in
[30:28] his soul
[30:30] ain't that right and that word
[30:33] degenerate a man is to decline or
[30:36] falling from a higher to a lower level
[30:39] in quality character or Vitality to pass
[30:43] from a higher to a lower type of
[30:46] condition
[30:47] now notice when man's Soul became
[30:50] degenerate it caused him to act
[30:53] different it caused him to think
[30:55] different it caused him to see things
[30:58] differently it changed his spirit and
[31:02] affected his body
[31:05] ain't that right
[31:07] we look at it and it wasn't just too far
[31:10] after this the fall but Genesis 6 and 2
[31:14] it tells us that the sons of God says
[31:18] children
[31:19] that that set was the atomist son right
[31:22] or son of Adam descendant of Adam the
[31:26] sons of God saw the daughters of men
[31:29] that they were fair and they took them
[31:31] wives of all which they chose now the
[31:36] prophet said they lost it for them women
[31:40] ain't that right they saw that they were
[31:42] beautiful and they lost it for them and
[31:45] went for them
[31:46] also there in the fifth verse of the
[31:50] Genesis 6 tells us that every
[31:53] imagination of the thoughts of man's
[31:57] heart was only evil continually
[32:02] continually
[32:03] now God wiped the the earth clean of man
[32:06] only Noah and his family were saved
[32:09] ain't that right but then as they began
[32:12] to to produce more offspring and feel
[32:15] the Earth again man man
[32:18] just feel the Earth with sin look where
[32:20] we're at today
[32:22] ain't that right it's the most evil age
[32:25] ever
[32:29] that's right
[32:30] see so Man became degenerate when you
[32:33] were born in this Natural Life the
[32:35] breath of life was breathed in you and
[32:38] that's your spirit
[32:39] see and and that spirit is of a worldly
[32:43] nature
[32:45] because it was not given from God the
[32:48] prophet said it was given or permitted
[32:51] by God
[32:53] didn't come from God it was permitted by
[32:56] God
[32:58] ain't that right so every child that's
[33:01] born in the world is born in sin shaped
[33:04] in iniquity come into this world
[33:06] speaking lies
[33:08] every child that way you don't have to
[33:10] teach a child to to get mad he just does
[33:13] it you don't have to teach a child to
[33:14] bite he just does it amen seed the
[33:17] person inside there is a sinner to begin
[33:22] with
[33:23] and by Nature by Nature you were of this
[33:28] world and alienated as Paul would tell
[33:31] us from the life of God
[33:35] ain't that right
[33:38] Paul in Ephesians 2 and 1 tells us that
[33:41] we were dead in trespasses and sins
[33:45] the soul was dead
[33:48] hello
[33:50] the soul was dead
[33:52] alienated couldn't understand
[33:54] Supernatural things
[33:56] couldn't understand the things of God
[33:59] the Bible even says that the carnal mind
[34:01] is enmity against God can't even come
[34:04] become subject to the law of God
[34:07] ain't that right
[34:09] so now many religions today or have
[34:13] always
[34:14] focused upon the body
[34:17] this whole flesh
[34:19] people get baptized and think that that
[34:22] saves them even the UPC denomination
[34:25] thinks that baptism washes the sins away
[34:28] but that doesn't save you at all
[34:31] right can you say man baptizing baptism
[34:34] does not wash away your sins it's only
[34:36] an act outward Act
[34:38] it's an outward act to show a man that
[34:42] you have died uh uh to yourself and that
[34:45] you have surrendered your heart to God
[34:47] ain't that right
[34:49] so but but they they go through the
[34:52] outward emotions and and then you have
[34:54] the legalists
[34:55] amen that lived by the law touch not
[34:59] taste not smell not handle not
[35:03] see not
[35:05] all of these things
[35:07] and and they make Christianity all about
[35:10] rules of do's and don'ts
[35:13] legalism produces the most meanest
[35:16] people on the face of the earth I think
[35:22] now the prophet said we're not supposed
[35:24] to make Converse to Christianity by a
[35:27] government
[35:28] but by the revelation
[35:32] the Christ in you as God was in Christ
[35:37] can you say Amen
[35:39] so the prophet said all that does all
[35:42] legalism does is make religious Fanatics
[35:46] out of people
[35:48] that's right
[35:49] it's true
[35:53] we was raised around them apostolics
[36:01] the focus was on you know
[36:03] and all the questions
[36:05] can I trim my hair can I not
[36:08] well just study the Bible
[36:11] you know how how how high is long you
[36:14] know when you're coming to the heels
[36:17] how how long do I have to be with my
[36:19] skirts
[36:20] how long do I have to do this and how
[36:22] much do I have to do this and that's all
[36:24] that the people focused on
[36:26] because they were looking at the outside
[36:29] and it never dealt with the insight
[36:34] then you say Amen now if you really want
[36:37] to go by the flesh Muslims have it
[36:39] better than us
[36:43] for the most part right
[36:45] they're so rigid in everything that they
[36:48] do
[36:49] praying five times a day I believe it is
[36:51] they shut down everything just to go
[36:52] depressed
[36:55] it's it's a it's a it's it's it's on the
[36:58] outside but you'll never be able to tame
[37:02] the flesh through legalistic teaching
[37:06] Prophet said many of you think because
[37:08] you got long hair that means you're
[37:10] going to heaven that doesn't mean that
[37:12] many of them thinks because you're a
[37:14] good moral woman you're going to heaven
[37:17] that don't mean that many of them think
[37:19] because their church is well belonged I
[37:21] belong to this and and this great group
[37:23] and great doctors of divinity that don't
[37:25] mean that he said you could have your
[37:27] hair long your dress is long and have a
[37:30] temper enough to fight a buzz saw hate
[37:32] your neighbor and everything else
[37:34] and gossip
[37:37] tear Church apart
[37:41] can you say Amen
[37:43] and yet because we focus so much on the
[37:47] outward appearance this old flesh
[37:50] we think we've really done something
[37:54] can you say Amen
[37:56] so then we find then there's people that
[37:59] go beyond that
[38:00] and and they don't worry about flesh
[38:03] and some people do but then they go into
[38:06] the spirit Realm
[38:08] the spirit
[38:10] so you know uh
[38:13] the prophet said your spirit can be
[38:15] Anointed with the genuine
[38:18] Holy Spirit
[38:21] right
[38:22] but that doesn't mean you're saved
[38:25] now this is where the Deception comes
[38:28] in ain't that right now I want you to
[38:30] listen now Matthew 5 44 Jesus and
[38:33] speaking of the father said he maketh
[38:36] his son to rise on the evil and on the
[38:39] good
[38:40] same Sun that rises
[38:42] Rises and Shines on the good and on the
[38:45] evil he sendeth his Reign upon the just
[38:49] and the unjust
[38:51] can you say Amen now listen as as the
[38:55] rain falls upon your pretty little
[38:56] flowers
[38:58] that same rain is falling on the weeds
[39:00] out there that you hate
[39:01] or that you have to keep mold
[39:06] it'd be nice if rain and fall on
[39:08] portions of things that we want
[39:10] follow my garden but don't fall on my
[39:13] grass cause I don't want to mow
[39:16] but the rain falls on the wheat and the
[39:18] weeds
[39:20] ain't that right
[39:22] see they benefit from the same rain they
[39:24] both Prosper they grow into maturity
[39:26] they both are planted in the same dirt
[39:29] the same field now listen Matthew 13 24
[39:33] it says another Parable putting you
[39:36] forth unto them saying the Kingdom of
[39:38] Heaven is likened unto a man with sow
[39:41] good seed in his field
[39:43] but while men slept his enemy came and
[39:47] soaked tares among the wheat and went
[39:49] his way
[39:50] but when the blade was sprung up and
[39:53] brought forth fruit then appeared the
[39:56] tears all Soul so the Servants of the
[39:59] householder came and said unto him sir
[40:01] did us not thou so good seed in thy
[40:03] field from whence then hath it tears and
[40:06] he said unto them the enemy hath done
[40:08] this the servant said unto him well thou
[40:11] them that we go and gather them up and
[40:12] he said no nay that's why we gather up
[40:15] the tears he root up also the wheat with
[40:18] them let both grow together until the
[40:22] Harvest
[40:23] today's the Harvest right it's harvest
[40:26] time and and the Gathering has taken
[40:28] place
[40:29] and in the time of harvest I will say to
[40:32] the Reapers Gather ye together first the
[40:35] tears and bind them into bundles to burn
[40:37] them amen and and and gather the we are
[40:40] but gather the wheat into my barn so we
[40:43] find two different seeds sowed by two
[40:47] different Sowers but planted in the same
[40:50] field receiving the same rain
[40:54] can you say Amen now we know who the
[40:57] Sowers are that was God and Satan
[41:00] ain't that right
[41:01] amen and they're receiving the same
[41:03] benefits now this would explain why
[41:06] Matthew 24 and 24 Jesus said there shall
[41:09] rise false christs
[41:13] right
[41:14] and false prophets
[41:16] and they shall show great signs and
[41:19] wonders in so much that if it were
[41:21] possible they should deceive the very
[41:24] elect now it's not possible aren't you
[41:26] glad for that
[41:27] amen but if it weren't possible it would
[41:30] be so close that it would deceive the
[41:32] very elect this deception now the word
[41:35] Christ means anointed ones
[41:37] ain't that right not false jesuses
[41:40] there's many jesuses but there's only
[41:43] one Christ one true Christ
[41:47] one true anointed
[41:49] ain't that right amen see and so there
[41:53] would be false teachers in other words
[41:54] as the prophet would let us know these
[41:57] men would be a Anointed with the true
[42:00] thing and yet false teachers of the word
[42:05] ain't that right
[42:07] now uh and I hope this all right but if
[42:11] you'll notice Jesus had to be anointed
[42:14] uh Luke 4 and 18 it says the spirit of
[42:17] the Lord is upon me because he hath
[42:20] anointed me to preach the gospel to the
[42:22] poor he hath sent me to heal the
[42:24] brokenhearted to preach Deliverance to
[42:26] the captives and recovering of sight to
[42:29] the blind to set at Liberty them that
[42:31] are bruised to preach the acceptable
[42:34] year of the Lord and he closed the book
[42:37] and he gave it again to the minister and
[42:40] sat down and the eyes of all of them
[42:42] that were in the synagogue were fastened
[42:45] on him and he began to say unto them
[42:49] this day this scripture is fulfilled in
[42:54] your ears
[42:55] now is listen to brother Wayne Uh
[42:57] preached down at the the meeting in
[42:59] Louisiana I really like what he said the
[43:01] other night he said he is not just the
[43:03] Son of God but he is the anointed Son of
[43:07] God he is not just the word but he is
[43:10] the anointed word he's not just the
[43:13] letter that he is the Dynamics of the
[43:16] letter he is not just the word he is the
[43:19] word and the flesh together
[43:23] can you say Amen
[43:26] amen see so you are nothing without the
[43:29] anointing
[43:32] you'll never leave the Bible without the
[43:34] anointing
[43:35] can you say Amen but notice the
[43:38] anointing can fall on your spirit and
[43:41] anoint you to do a certain thing and you
[43:44] do it
[43:45] and still be lost
[43:48] ain't that right K Ephesus prophesied
[43:53] and yet he consented
[43:56] to Jesus's crucifixion
[43:59] Judas cast out devils and yet the Bible
[44:03] said he was the son of perdition son of
[44:06] the devil
[44:07] Balaam prophesied yet he was a false
[44:11] prophet that calls God's people to
[44:13] commit fornication
[44:15] see they were anointed and yes they did
[44:18] prophesy and yes they did cast out
[44:21] devils
[44:22] but it never changed who they were
[44:26] ain't that right they they the spirit
[44:28] had anointed them to prophesy and to do
[44:31] these things but the difference was
[44:34] Jesus was the anointed word
[44:38] ain't that right look the Bible says he
[44:42] picked up the book and found the place
[44:43] where it was written of him
[44:46] think of that he knew his place in the
[44:48] Bible
[44:50] he knew it he knew what day it was and
[44:53] he knew that he was commissioned to
[44:55] fulfill the prophecy for his day
[44:59] ain't that right see the prophet had
[45:02] already spoken over his life
[45:07] well it's true anyhow
[45:10] the prophet had already spoken
[45:13] the prophet Moses the prophet Isaiah the
[45:17] prophet Isa Ezekiel amen all the
[45:19] prophets spoke of the Messiah
[45:22] the prophet David
[45:26] ain't that right
[45:28] Hallelujah
[45:30] you know
[45:31] these blind Pharisees of this they call
[45:34] us Pentecostals
[45:35] because we dance and we shout and we
[45:38] Haul her
[45:39] we get excited at the word
[45:42] they say oh that's Pentecostal
[45:45] we preach under the inspiration
[45:48] and they have no clue as to what they're
[45:51] talking about
[45:52] you see you look I I was raised in a
[45:55] Pentecostal movement
[45:57] and and uh uh oh yeah they shouted they
[46:01] screamed and they hollered and they were
[46:03] anointed but for what
[46:07] come on don't be Baptist on me tonight
[46:10] for what
[46:13] nothing
[46:15] there was no word there
[46:19] can you say Amen
[46:21] see if there's no word over their life
[46:23] then what good is the anointing
[46:30] and so they try to compare us they try
[46:33] to compare us with the Pentecostal
[46:34] movement oh they're just excited oh they
[46:37] just you know they just they they just
[46:38] we don't have to have music to get
[46:40] excited like Pentecostals do
[46:43] a real believer just to gets excited
[46:46] about the word of God
[46:48] and if you notice now listen now if you
[46:53] notice we are fulfilling Revelations the
[46:57] fifth chapter
[47:01] and we don't have to just do it say well
[47:03] I'm going to try to do it no it's in our
[47:06] heart
[47:07] there's something that just moves us
[47:10] and when the book was open there came
[47:14] shouting and screaming and John said I
[47:17] was one of them
[47:19] ain't that right and John was a
[47:23] representation of the of the Bride
[47:26] now the rain falls on the just and the
[47:29] unjust and the weeds Rejoice with the
[47:31] wheat but it's what lays at the core
[47:35] does does the rain does the rain make
[47:38] the weeds wheat
[47:41] nope it doesn't
[47:43] oh the the rain falls upon them both but
[47:46] it doesn't change what they are
[47:49] it just helps them to mature
[47:52] then you say Amen so we find brother
[47:55] Brown says you see it in yet they're
[47:58] anointed in the spirit but they got
[48:00] backbitings talking about the
[48:02] Pentecostals backbitings fightings and
[48:05] everything else amongst the Christian
[48:07] church
[48:08] anointed in the spirit
[48:12] perfecting the flesh
[48:15] as far as morals
[48:21] Bill Brown said the same holy spirit
[48:23] that anoints the church that gives them
[48:25] the desire to save Souls that gives them
[48:27] the desire the power to perform Miracles
[48:29] it also falls on the unjust just the
[48:32] same as it does the just
[48:34] but they are not anointed to the word
[48:39] can you say Amen they're not anointed to
[48:41] the word he said the outside I think we
[48:44] read this last time but the outside
[48:45] Spirit can be Anointed with the Holy
[48:47] Ghost and the Soul be as pit the darkest
[48:51] pitch
[48:52] see the Cocker bear grows on the same
[48:55] water puts life that puts life into the
[48:58] wheat puts life into the Kookaburra and
[49:01] at the bottom of the Kookaburra it's a
[49:03] Cocker bear life it's rejoicing and
[49:06] blooming and got life and doing
[49:08] everything that the wheat does but the
[49:11] soul of it is Cocker bear
[49:15] false teachers can rise teaching all
[49:19] kinds of trinitarianism and everything
[49:21] else and be Anointed with the Holy Ghost
[49:24] and perform just as many miracles as the
[49:27] true gospel can but it's by the word
[49:31] that does it
[49:33] give it the word test can you say Amen
[49:36] I know I'm reading a lot of quotes but I
[49:39] hope that's all right
[49:40] Holy Spirit the Holy Spirit can fall
[49:43] upon a man in his spirit
[49:45] but his soul is his germ
[49:50] and that germ is the word
[49:55] he said I don't care how much you can
[49:57] preach how will you do this and how much
[49:59] you love that's one of the inlets of the
[50:01] spirit you can't love with your body you
[50:03] love with your spirit that's one of the
[50:06] inlets you can love and even love God
[50:08] and still not be right
[50:13] you with me
[50:14] you can love
[50:19] and you should love
[50:24] but the problem is people misuse love
[50:27] and he ain't got no bears with it
[50:30] and they take Holy Love and make it
[50:32] filthy love
[50:36] ungodly love
[50:39] hello
[50:41] let's just love everybody and not have
[50:42] any standards or convictions at all
[50:48] well see that love comes from the spirit
[50:51] and you can even love God and still not
[50:53] be right you can cast out devils and
[50:56] preach and do these things and still not
[50:58] be right Jesus said so many would come
[51:02] in that day but the word settles it
[51:05] in the beginning was the word and the
[51:07] Word was with God and the Word was God
[51:10] and the word became flesh and dwelt
[51:14] Among Us
[51:16] you realize that's where we're at today
[51:17] the word to become flesh every prophecy
[51:21] speaking of this bride must become flesh
[51:26] yes sir
[51:29] now the anointing has come upon the
[51:31] church to Manifest this portion of the
[51:34] word of God for this age
[51:36] so the prophet said if that soul
[51:39] didn't come from God then it wasn't a
[51:41] germ of God to begin with
[51:44] just like the priest he heard Jesus
[51:46] teach he saw them the supernatural works
[51:50] of God done by Jesus
[51:54] he saw the sign of the Messiah
[51:58] and then called her the devil
[52:00] because there was nothing to Quicken his
[52:03] soul
[52:05] hello
[52:06] you couldn't you couldn't the Bible said
[52:08] you couldn't blame you they they were
[52:11] these were righteous men holy men
[52:13] as far as the flesh
[52:16] nobody can put a finger upon them on
[52:19] their lives
[52:21] but Jesus said they were of their father
[52:23] of the devil
[52:24] ain't that right
[52:27] but then you find he'd done many signs
[52:29] and wonders among the priests
[52:32] and they call it a devil but he done one
[52:34] time performed the Messiah sign to the
[52:36] woman at the well
[52:38] ain't that right and immediately she saw
[52:41] that he was the Messiah
[52:44] and what did it do it changed her from
[52:47] what person she was
[52:50] totally transformed her to another
[52:53] person
[52:55] what the prophet said she had fallen
[52:58] from God's thoughts
[52:59] she could be redeemed she was a subject
[53:03] and she had representation in heaven and
[53:06] she turned around
[53:08] he said if she didn't have
[53:10] representation from predestination it
[53:12] would have never taken hold
[53:15] so now
[53:17] I know this is simple for most of us but
[53:19] now this is why a man must be born again
[53:24] it goes beyond the flesh it goes beyond
[53:28] the spirit
[53:30] and it takes place in the soul
[53:35] ain't that right
[53:37] see that that's when that old nature
[53:40] dies and rots
[53:42] and God comes in and establishes his
[53:47] throne
[53:48] can you say Amen
[53:50] that's right see brother Brown said when
[53:53] when God comes into the heart that Soul
[53:56] see partnership with us by taking this
[53:59] Earthly man and his eternal spirit and
[54:02] joining them together
[54:05] ain't that right and it's the only way
[54:09] that God could establish his throne into
[54:12] the heart of man
[54:15] ain't ain't that right
[54:16] you perfect the flesh through all the
[54:18] do's and don'ts and yet you're still
[54:21] your own man
[54:22] and let God just anoint that spirit and
[54:26] you may prophesy speaking tongues roll
[54:28] on the floor you you may preach you may
[54:30] see a vision you may whatever and still
[54:33] act like a devil
[54:38] that's right
[54:41] now see the prophet tells us that the
[54:44] outside man can reason
[54:46] and so outside man
[54:49] a man man may look at a woman
[54:52] beautiful sexy dressed
[54:56] and she might he might say well I you
[54:58] know
[54:59] I'm not supposed to be doing that
[55:02] I'm not supposed to commit adultery
[55:06] well see it's the spirit of a man that's
[55:08] telling that man he shouldn't do it
[55:12] hello
[55:14] but way down in the soul the prophet
[55:17] said that thing is still there
[55:20] oh my God come on hello
[55:23] and that's what will govern that man
[55:27] that's what will control him and if
[55:31] there's nothing to control him to the
[55:33] word
[55:37] he'll go for it
[55:41] and say man
[55:45] now I'm closing
[55:48] but the prophet said when it's directed
[55:50] from the inside
[55:53] it throws all the rest of it together
[55:58] and that's the guidepost
[56:00] that's the control tower the inside of
[56:05] the inside
[56:08] see the real gift he says is your soul
[56:12] down there
[56:14] that was born of God that controls your
[56:19] spirit and your body to the word of God
[56:24] and the will of God
[56:27] can you say Amen
[56:30] now this is where David says he restores
[56:32] my soul
[56:36] the Lord is my shepherd
[56:38] he's the one that's leading
[56:42] he wasn't just one that would perfect
[56:44] his flesh
[56:46] and then God tried to lead him
[56:48] I ain't going that way
[56:53] try to tell him God sent a prophet and
[56:55] show them
[56:57] that God promised to send a prophet in
[57:00] this day
[57:01] Malachi 4 and 5.
[57:04] but they've been taught against it there
[57:07] ain't no such thing or they've seen all
[57:09] these other false prophets
[57:12] Joseph Smith the Mormons they follow and
[57:14] they got some weird doctrines they had
[57:16] to even write another book
[57:19] you know that's a scarecrow to keep
[57:20] people away from the real thing
[57:24] but it doesn't do away with the fact
[57:26] that God promised to send a prophet
[57:30] amen can you say Amen
[57:34] now church we know that Jesus is the
[57:36] coming king of this Earth
[57:39] but that doesn't mean that he's not King
[57:41] now
[57:43] ain't that right
[57:46] he is our King he is the king of saints
[57:49] the Bible calls him
[57:51] and his kingdom today is a spiritual
[57:54] Kingdom
[57:56] it's not of this world's system and
[57:59] neither are we of this world
[58:02] there's nothing about this world that we
[58:04] are part of
[58:06] is that right
[58:09] and because he is our King and
[58:12] establishes his throne in the soul or
[58:16] the heart of man
[58:19] we act different
[58:21] from the world
[58:23] our citizenship is in heaven
[58:27] we reflect the spirit
[58:31] of another world
[58:33] of our rebirth
[58:35] then you say Amen
[58:37] where Jesus is the king that's why our
[58:40] women do not dress in men's clothing or
[58:43] cut their hair
[58:44] or use all the cosmetics and other
[58:47] things that the world likes so much
[58:49] that is why our men don't drink and
[58:52] smoke and listen to the rock and roll
[58:55] and the country and the filth
[58:58] and carry on in the Sin
[59:02] it's not because we live by a law
[59:06] of do's and don'ts
[59:08] it's because the king
[59:11] has Abode or taken established his
[59:14] throne in our hearts
[59:17] and he's not dragging us
[59:22] he's our Shepherd
[59:25] and he leads us
[59:27] into Green Pastures into the word
[59:31] and you say Amen
[59:33] and our Dominion
[59:35] the prophesied is a dominion over sin
[59:40] and it is enforced through the power
[59:42] that is in the spirit of Christ that
[59:45] indwells us
[59:47] and every Kingdom on Earth is going to
[59:49] be torn down
[59:50] but ours will remain
[59:53] can you say Amen
[59:55] if the musicians will come
[59:58] ours will remain
[1:00:01] ours will remain
[1:00:03] and think of it those that have listened
[1:00:05] to the voice
[1:00:07] you see we're in a in a time because as
[1:00:10] in Revelations 4 1.
[1:00:15] The Voice
[1:00:16] John heard the voice of God
[1:00:20] say come up hither
[1:00:23] you see it's the voice
[1:00:26] of God that's bringing on this rapture
[1:00:29] we're hearing the voice
[1:00:31] hearing the voice hearing the voice
[1:00:35] that's why
[1:00:37] we've shunned all strange voices
[1:00:42] you know the Bible says make your
[1:00:43] calling in election sure
[1:00:46] don't don't take things for granted
[1:00:50] but make sure that word is having effect
[1:00:52] in your life
[1:00:54] can you say man
[1:00:56] make sure that the Lord is your Shepherd
[1:00:59] don't don't be led by your feelings
[1:01:01] don't be led by your emotions
[1:01:03] don't be led by your own thinking
[1:01:07] let the Lord be your Shepherd
[1:01:10] and the only way it can happen is he
[1:01:12] restores the soul
[1:01:14] Hallelujah do you love him
[1:01:17] amen amen what song
[1:01:21] give me the word
