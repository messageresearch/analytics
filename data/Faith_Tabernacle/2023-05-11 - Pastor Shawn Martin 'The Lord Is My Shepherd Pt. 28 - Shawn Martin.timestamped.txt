[29:05] turn to the Book of Psalms the
[29:08] 23rd chapter
[29:11] and we want to
[29:15] remember brother Mark Spencer is going
[29:18] to be having his meeting
[29:20] on Memorial Day weekend which would be
[29:23] May 26th I think it's just Friday and
[29:27] Saturday I it may be Sunday too but I
[29:30] believe brother Ron and brother Barry
[29:34] will be speaking
[29:37] and those nights
[29:39] I think brother Ron Friday and brother
[29:42] Berry Saturday I think that's how it
[29:44] went
[29:45] but so if you're able to go I'm sure you
[29:49] will be blessed and will be a blessing
[29:51] to them
[29:52] praise the Lord
[29:54] let's just bow our heads before we read
[29:57] the word and just ask the Lord to help
[29:59] us tonight
[30:01] precious Lord we
[30:03] thank you that you are our refuge
[30:06] in times of trouble
[30:09] and Lord we see trouble all throughout
[30:11] the land
[30:13] and Lord we're just thankful father that
[30:16] we're hit in you
[30:18] have that token applied
[30:21] and Lord just asking now that you would
[30:23] come
[30:25] and you administer to every need tonight
[30:27] father
[30:29] a novel speaker and hearer prayed Lord
[30:32] that you would cover us with your blood
[30:34] father if there's anything that
[30:37] we have done said Lord we pray that you
[30:40] would forgive us of it father
[30:42] Lord I pray that you would just draw us
[30:45] all closer to thee we ask it in Jesus
[30:49] Christ's name amen
[30:52] praise the Lord let's say it's good to
[30:54] have Mom with us amen always good to
[30:57] have them we've just enjoyed having her
[31:00] dad dad is feeling pretty weak today and
[31:04] so if you want to just keep him in
[31:07] prayer I know he would appreciate that
[31:10] but the book of Psalms the 23rd chapter
[31:14] it says the Lord is my shepherd
[31:17] I shall not want.
[31:20] he maketh me to lie down in Green
[31:22] Pastures he leadeth me beside the Still
[31:25] Waters
[31:26] he restoreth my soul
[31:29] he leadeth me in the paths of
[31:31] righteousness for his name's sake
[31:33] yea though I walk through the valley of
[31:36] the shadow of death
[31:38] I will fear no evil
[31:41] for thou art with me amen you can have
[31:45] your seats this evening
[31:49] beautiful day to serve the Lord
[31:51] and
[31:53] trust everyone just had a good day amen
[31:56] but we've been looking at this chapter
[32:00] in verses for for a while now
[32:03] and of course David says the Lord is my
[32:07] shepherd and and we know him to be our
[32:10] guide
[32:11] and I I think that is the true uh well
[32:15] the Bible says they that are the sons of
[32:18] God are led by the spirit of God
[32:21] and so it's it's important that he be
[32:24] our guide and that we be his sheep
[32:29] and he considers us as sheep because
[32:31] sheep are lead
[32:33] sheep can't find their way and we know
[32:37] that we are led by his voice which is
[32:41] the word of God
[32:43] and I'm so glad that we have had the
[32:45] word of God the word of God not being a
[32:48] theology it's not some Seminary teaching
[32:52] but the word of God come to a prophet in
[32:54] this age to restore us back to the word
[32:58] and so I'm glad that we can accept the
[33:02] the message of the hour uh as our
[33:05] headship amen it's more than just a
[33:08] teaching it's it's the headship that has
[33:11] come to lead and guide us and then David
[33:15] would tell us that he maketh me to lie
[33:17] down in Green Pastures and we talked
[33:19] about these things but you know uh uh uh
[33:23] lying down it's he maketh me to rest in
[33:27] Green Pastures and Green Pastures is
[33:30] where the food is it's it's it's Green
[33:33] Pastures which speaks of life amen it's
[33:36] fresh it's life and and so that's that's
[33:40] where amen Our Shepherd leads us to in
[33:44] this age and he leadeth me beside the
[33:47] Steel Waters and of course Waters also
[33:50] speaks of life and and it's a place of
[33:55] of rest a quiet place for their Still
[33:58] Waters and and if there's ever a time
[34:01] that the people of God needed to stay
[34:05] quiet it's it's in this age a lot of
[34:09] turmoil a lot of upheaval a lot of
[34:11] things that are going on a lot of voices
[34:13] in the land and and but yet the shepherd
[34:17] uh by his voice and I say by the message
[34:21] of the hour leads us to a quiet place
[34:24] it's and that's where the life is a man
[34:28] and and of course first uh chapter of
[34:32] Psalms David talks about the rivers of
[34:35] water and and how that there's a the man
[34:38] that is is planted we're planted by the
[34:42] rivers of water and and the prophets
[34:46] that planted means predestinated you're
[34:49] you didn't come there by chance you're
[34:51] not just stuck out and transplanted but
[34:55] you were predestinated to be there amen
[34:58] that's your position in Christ Is by The
[35:01] Still Waters in in Green Pastures and
[35:04] and I'm so glad that we have a a we're
[35:09] finding our purpose we're not just
[35:12] accidentally come to this message but
[35:14] this is what we were predestinated for
[35:17] it it it it it fits us ain't that right
[35:20] and so then then in that third verse is
[35:24] what we've been talking for about for
[35:26] for a few services and that is he
[35:29] leadeth me in the paths of righteousness
[35:32] and and and of course this is the same
[35:36] path that proverbs 4 18 speaks of where
[35:40] it says the path of the just is as a
[35:43] Shining Light that shineth more and more
[35:48] unto a a perfect day it and so it's uh
[35:54] uh getting brighter in other words and
[35:56] this is the path of the righteous and
[35:58] and church if there's any time ever a
[36:02] time that the the the revelation of the
[36:06] Bible is more clear it's now amen the
[36:09] mysteries of God being made known is now
[36:13] and it wasn't just made known by a
[36:15] prophet but it's now being made known by
[36:18] You and I by Our Lives because we have
[36:22] become a living voice amen the word of
[36:25] God taking uh having the preeminence in
[36:29] our lives and and so it's the path of
[36:32] righteousness and this word
[36:34] righteousness of course brother Branham
[36:36] said is his word a man so he's leading
[36:40] Us in the paths of his word and and and
[36:44] we we've used that scripture uh where
[36:46] Jesus said it becometh us to fulfill all
[36:50] righteousness to fulfill all word we are
[36:53] to fulfill all the word that was spoken
[36:56] of the bride of Christ do you believe
[36:58] that it could not be fulfilled until
[37:01] this time others have talked about it
[37:04] they've lived for it they've they've
[37:06] sung about it they preached about it and
[37:09] and wrote about it but here we are in
[37:12] this day we are the the the finale we
[37:16] are the the people where God is able to
[37:20] fulfill his word in us and and and what
[37:24] a great responsibility that is for you
[37:27] and I that it's not it's more than just
[37:29] going to church it's more than just
[37:31] claiming a religion it's more than even
[37:34] just believing in a prophet because we
[37:36] there there's others that believe in
[37:38] prophets and and and these things and
[37:40] others have claimed to be prophets and
[37:42] they still claim to be prophets and and
[37:44] all of that but but we find that God
[37:47] would send us a prophet and we saw it
[37:49] Vindicated of God and and and his
[37:52] message is actually taking form in our
[37:56] lives amen and so brother Branham said
[37:59] we are called to walk straight down that
[38:02] line of scripture to fulfill all God's
[38:06] righteousness of today amen so that's
[38:09] what we're here for amen and we couldn't
[38:12] fulfill all righteousness if this word
[38:15] hadn't been opened up to us but this
[38:17] word now is is is is is opened up to us
[38:21] it's no longer a mystery it's not us
[38:24] just proven and and trying to figure it
[38:27] all out but actually it's become a
[38:29] mirror to us can you say man we're
[38:32] finding ourselves more and more that
[38:34] that God was writing about us all
[38:37] throughout the Bible he was writing
[38:39] about us and and you say well the the
[38:42] theme is Jesus Christ Cincinnati is true
[38:44] but it's Christ in you amen it's Christ
[38:48] in you so you're part of the book you're
[38:50] you're part of the mystery for that's
[38:53] what the Bible says the mystery is
[38:55] Christ in you the hope of glory amen and
[38:59] and so we we're finding a man that we're
[39:02] walking this is what we're called to do
[39:04] he leadeth Us in the paths of his word
[39:08] in the paths of righteousness and and
[39:11] and in other words we have been
[39:13] commissioned do you believe that we have
[39:17] been commissioned we're not just here
[39:19] floating around we're we're not just
[39:21] here by abiding our time of these things
[39:24] but we have been commissioned to this
[39:27] word amen right right here and and the
[39:30] word commission is an authorization or
[39:33] command to act in a prescribed manner or
[39:38] to perform a prescribed acts amen it's a
[39:42] charge unto us the church has been given
[39:46] a charge the church has been given a a
[39:50] commission amen the authority to act in
[39:54] a subscribed way the churches have tried
[39:57] to do it denominations have tried to
[39:59] reform the people into doing uh uh to
[40:03] live in this word and to making this
[40:05] word live legalists have come and tried
[40:08] to make the people uh live this word and
[40:11] they have all failed but God would open
[40:14] the word to us in this age and by his
[40:18] voice he would lead us in the very Paths
[40:22] of righteousness that people have tried
[40:24] to do for years and years and years so
[40:28] we find that that we as the bride of
[40:31] Christ are commissioned and the
[40:34] commission is the predestinated will of
[40:37] God Amen it's the predestinated will of
[40:41] God you're not here by accident amen but
[40:44] you're here and and we we know we read
[40:47] about it uh talked about it uh uh last
[40:50] time uh but Jesus was predestinated to
[40:53] be what he was ain't that right he was
[40:57] predestinated every part of the
[40:59] scripture was predestinated that spoke
[41:02] of the Messiah amen was predestinated
[41:05] for him and he was predestinated for
[41:08] that scriptures for he he told them he
[41:11] said search the scriptures for in them
[41:14] you think you have eternal life but they
[41:16] testify of who I am and so is it that
[41:19] the scriptures testify of who this bride
[41:22] is because it's a predestinated plan of
[41:26] God God it's it's a predestinated will
[41:29] of God and so Jesus knew his position in
[41:33] the word and we've read this but brother
[41:35] Branham said Jesus Christ no matter if
[41:38] he was in a storm and The gales knocking
[41:40] the boat from one side to the other or
[41:43] he was standing in the face of demons if
[41:45] he was hanging anywhere it never moved
[41:49] him he walked right along just as calm
[41:52] and quiet as he could be why he was
[41:55] simply unconscious of fear or anything
[41:58] around him that's right whether it was
[42:00] going to happen or whether it wasn't
[42:02] going to happen he knowed it was going
[42:05] to happen because God said so he didn't
[42:08] say well I wonder if I prayed through
[42:09] wonder if I fasted long enough wonder if
[42:11] I did this he just walked right on
[42:14] unconscious that's right he believed
[42:16] what God Said was truth the words must
[42:19] be fulfilled he knew what his life was
[42:23] to fulfill them so he knew that his life
[42:25] was to to fulfill the very words amen he
[42:29] said and you're here to fulfill it too
[42:31] so just walk unconscious of fear walk
[42:34] unconscious of criticism walk
[42:36] unconscious of the world walk as you
[42:39] walk in Christ walk with him not paying
[42:42] any attention to the right to the left
[42:44] hand just keep moving on something comes
[42:47] up in the church walk with God
[42:48] hallelujah sickness strikes you walk
[42:51] with God if the neighbor don't like you
[42:53] walk with God just keep on Walking with
[42:56] God can you say amen amen why because we
[43:00] were predestinated for a certain thing
[43:02] and it must be fulfilled and he's
[43:05] leading us amen he's leading us uh uh
[43:08] God ain't gonna Lead You amen uh uh in
[43:12] in a trash sheep somewhere amen that's
[43:14] not God leading amen God's God's going
[43:17] to lead you in his word ain't that right
[43:19] there ain't no such thing as burnt out
[43:21] amen not when you're walking with God
[43:24] not when you're you're in the past of
[43:27] God Amen uh uh sure you get discouraged
[43:31] sure yet all of these things as we
[43:33] talked about Sunday their seasons in our
[43:36] life but but regardless of of what takes
[43:39] place we're called it never changes
[43:42] God's predestinated will for us you
[43:45] believe that it just doesn't change amen
[43:48] and so now Noah amen the prophet said
[43:51] Noah and all the prophets they they that
[43:54] the Saints of old they knew their
[43:56] position
[43:57] amen for their day and was willing to
[44:00] stand criticism or anything else that
[44:03] the word of God might be fulfilled amen
[44:07] uh God never gave me Noah a man an e a
[44:11] bed of ease he didn't give them a life
[44:13] of these amen he didn't give it amen the
[44:16] promise when Noah wanted that promise he
[44:19] gave Noah the promise and told him to
[44:21] preach that promise amen and act upon
[44:24] that promise live upon that promise
[44:26] promise and and know it was so persuaded
[44:28] of that promise a man he didn't care how
[44:31] long it would take he knew it was common
[44:33] to Reign and he would prepare for it and
[44:36] the Bible says that he prayed for the
[44:38] prepared for the saving of his household
[44:40] amen he didn't care who would stand with
[44:43] him he knew that he was doing it amen
[44:45] for his household can you say amen and
[44:48] we're doing it for our household amen
[44:51] saved you may not be popular in this
[44:53] world but it doesn't matter amen you may
[44:55] not be whatever it doesn't matter you've
[44:57] got to be persuaded of your position in
[45:00] the word of God to where you can stand
[45:03] amen Against All Odds amen so that the
[45:07] word of God might be fulfilled brother
[45:10] random said you cannot do anything
[45:11] unless you know what you're doing amen
[45:14] so so don't try to serve God if you
[45:17] don't know what you're doing you got to
[45:18] know what you're doing amen I just don't
[45:21] believe that God doesn't bear witness
[45:22] where the Bible says his Spirit bearth
[45:25] witness with our spirit that we are sons
[45:28] of God Amen that ain't going to be when
[45:30] we get into heaven that ain't going to
[45:32] be when we receive a body change I
[45:34] believe that spirit is with us I believe
[45:36] that spirit is confirming to us that we
[45:39] are the sons of God whether we feel God
[45:42] or not we are the sons of God whether it
[45:45] looks like the sun is shining or it's
[45:46] just stormy all over we are the sons of
[45:49] God Amen and we're willing to stand
[45:52] though that the word can be fulfilled
[45:54] and he said you must know that it is the
[45:57] will of God Amen you must know amen
[46:00] don't don't just you know don't we're
[46:02] not playing the Patty Cake don't try to
[46:04] play patty cake with the devil amen
[46:06] don't try to venture without Authority
[46:08] in pursuing you've got to know that it's
[46:11] the will of God for your life you got to
[46:13] know that the Rapture is the will of God
[46:15] you got to know amen that salvation is
[46:17] the will of God for you you got to know
[46:19] that this message is the will of God for
[46:22] you you got to know that every promise
[46:24] in this Bible is the will of God God for
[46:27] you can you say amen that's the only way
[46:29] you're going to stand that's the only
[46:30] way that you're gonna amen with stand
[46:33] the devil in this hour amen is to know
[46:35] the will of God see he said you must
[46:38] know that it is his plan and his desire
[46:42] and it's revealed to you then there's
[46:45] nothing going to stop it so see Noah
[46:48] built the ark not on presuming not upon
[46:51] a good idea not because he ate a bowl of
[46:53] cereal and felt good from him and
[46:55] decides to build an ark that it was
[46:57] revealed to him that he was the one to
[47:00] build the ark amen and he acted upon
[47:03] that revelation
[47:06] now if he'd done that and he waited for
[47:08] 120 years so withstood the criticism and
[47:11] the making fun and and all that unbelief
[47:14] amen then we can't expect anything less
[47:16] Amen in this age can you say amen amen
[47:20] that's right so now the prophet said
[47:23] after Noah had met God and had no God's
[47:27] plan for the day it was becoming to him
[47:30] that he fulfilled all that he was
[47:33] commissioned to do amen it was becoming
[47:36] Noah to Noah amen he it had been
[47:39] revealed to him God had called him God
[47:42] had bore witness to him amen that it was
[47:45] going to rain amen and that he was the
[47:47] one to build the ark amen and so is it
[47:50] in in this age amen if you get nothing
[47:53] out of the message of the hour but a
[47:55] confirmation that you're the one amen
[47:58] now that that's what the message of the
[47:59] hour is you understand amen is that when
[48:02] you hear the message there's something
[48:04] that strikes your heart and say is
[48:06] that's me that's right that's the one
[48:08] I'm the one I'm the one for a Rapture
[48:10] I'm the one for a body change I am what
[48:13] John lived out I am the one amen that
[48:16] all the tell Testament prophets and and
[48:18] sages talked about I'm that one it's a
[48:21] confirmation you're not always going to
[48:23] feel that confirmation you're not always
[48:25] going to feel amen like they're running
[48:27] through a man you're not always going to
[48:29] feel like you're in Revival but the
[48:31] Revelation must stay and you must stay
[48:34] true to the revelation
[48:37] you got to stay true
[48:39] he leads me in the paths of
[48:41] righteousness ain't that right
[48:43] so so after Moses even a man had met
[48:47] with God at the burning bush
[48:49] amen see he then knew his position
[48:52] and he was willing to face all criticism
[48:55] he was willing to face All Odds amen
[48:58] because he had received a revelation
[49:00] from God that he was the one he'd
[49:03] received the revelation of his day ain't
[49:06] that right more than just intellect amen
[49:10] it was a divine revelation
[49:13] now David tells us that it's not going
[49:16] to be easy walking the paths of
[49:18] righteousness
[49:19] amen oh it sounds glorious he leadeth me
[49:21] in these Paths of righteousness amen but
[49:24] but it's not going to be easy amen and
[49:27] and uh uh even though we we know that we
[49:32] have been commissioned to fulfill the
[49:33] word of God and we know our position in
[49:36] the word yet it's not going to be easy
[49:39] we talked about it Sunday amen don't
[49:41] expect it to be easy the Bible says the
[49:44] just shall live by faith do you believe
[49:46] that the just shall live by faith you
[49:48] know what that means then faith will
[49:50] deny every sense amen it'll deny all
[49:54] your five senses when when you can't see
[49:56] it faith says it's there when you can't
[49:58] feel it faith says it's real can you say
[50:01] Amen so you cannot live by what you see
[50:03] you can't live by what you feel you
[50:05] can't live by any other sins you've got
[50:08] to live by faith
[50:11] and faith is a revelation faith comes by
[50:14] Revelation that's right same God reveals
[50:17] it to us so it doesn't take Faith when
[50:20] everything is going easy it doesn't take
[50:22] endurance amen when there's no troubles
[50:26] ain't that right amen when when you're
[50:29] going down the hill it doesn't take
[50:31] endurance
[50:32] hey Vance when you going up that
[50:34] mountain
[50:35] and you're breathing hard
[50:37] and you're barely making it your legs
[50:39] are burning
[50:40] yeah I have that old time
[50:42] and and and you you know yeah you know
[50:45] you just don't know if you can make it
[50:48] and and and and your mind is already
[50:50] back in the vehicle but but you got to
[50:53] make it right well that's the Christian
[50:55] way
[50:58] ain't that right it's the Christian way
[51:00] amen that's why Jesus said he that
[51:03] endureth to the end the same shall be
[51:04] saved amen he didn't tell you how life
[51:08] it was going to be he didn't give us all
[51:10] the answers to the questions amen that
[51:12] come our way but he said just endure to
[51:15] the End Amen and you'll never be able to
[51:18] endure it without faith
[51:21] ain't that right amen yes sir see so you
[51:25] don't have to make a stand if there is
[51:27] an opposition
[51:28] but it's in the opposition time of
[51:31] opposition that you have to make a stand
[51:32] ain't that right so it's not going to be
[51:35] easy walking amen uh uh uh uh these
[51:39] Paths of righteousness for the next
[51:41] thing David says is for though I walk
[51:45] through the valley of the shadow of
[51:47] death now you know see while God is
[51:50] leading Us in the paths of righteousness
[51:52] we're walking through the valley of the
[51:55] shadow of death
[51:57] now the prophet said that people say
[51:59] well it's a dark Valley he said no it
[52:01] cannot be dark it can't be a dark Valley
[52:04] yeah uh if there's a shadow ain't that
[52:07] right he said it takes so much light and
[52:09] we know it it takes so much light and so
[52:11] much Darkness to make a Shadow Amen in
[52:14] other words there has to be truth
[52:17] and there
[52:18] ain't that right sickness and healing
[52:21] faith and unbelief love and hate God and
[52:24] Satan see light and darkness causes a
[52:28] shadow in the valley ain't that right
[52:31] amen so in other words he's not leading
[52:34] Us in the paths of righteousness when we
[52:36] get to heaven amen he's leading Us in
[52:40] the paths of righteousness in the Valley
[52:42] of the shadow of death now Paul you know
[52:47] in speaking of the Old Testament said
[52:49] that it was a shadow of good things to
[52:52] come the law was the shadow of good
[52:55] things to come in other words it wasn't
[52:57] all dark there amen but there was some
[53:00] light that was there ain't that right
[53:02] light in the Old Testament yes we see
[53:05] the fall of Adam and Eve but then we see
[53:08] Redemption amen the act of redemption
[53:11] The Plan of Redemption there was sin but
[53:14] yet there was an atonement there was the
[53:16] law of condemnation but there was the
[53:18] grace of God Amen that abounded see it
[53:21] it brought forth a shadow
[53:25] ain't that right now if you want to look
[53:28] at it look at us amen see we are both
[53:31] natural and Supernatural this body is
[53:34] subject to death amen we come born of a
[53:38] home and see amen We Are The Offspring
[53:40] of Adam and Eve amen so that makes our
[53:44] body born in sin shaping and iniquity
[53:47] come into this world speaking lies see
[53:50] and every one of us the prophet said are
[53:53] damned and condemned at the beginning of
[53:56] our life without a chance ain't that
[53:59] right see he says see because the spirit
[54:02] that you have uh come to you by nature
[54:05] and by Nature coming from sexual
[54:07] intercourse by Desire by man and woman
[54:11] produces an Earthly child let that child
[54:14] alone and don't teach him nothing right
[54:15] he'll go wrong don't teach him neither
[54:18] right or wrong he'll take wrong because
[54:20] it's his nature to do such ain't that
[54:23] right amen watch a little infant child
[54:25] out get mad and kick and hold its breath
[54:28] and turn red you know and and uh throw
[54:31] that temper tantrum well he got it he
[54:33] had that child either got it from mama
[54:35] or daddy or or yeah Mama or daddy and
[54:38] the prophet said if he didn't get it
[54:39] from them he got it from the
[54:40] grandparents but somewhere in that
[54:43] nature that family tree comes to Nature
[54:45] ain't that right see amen so so he said
[54:48] you come by a nature and your whole body
[54:51] or your whole being is black and smutty
[54:56] and Damned and cursed and going to hell
[54:59] ain't that right amen see that's the
[55:02] Dark Side of us amen but then the
[55:05] prophet says but when a man is Born
[55:07] Again seek them the light of God shines
[55:10] down into that soul and it's no more a
[55:14] dark Valley but it's a valley with a
[55:16] shadow in it
[55:18] ain't that right see it's it's a shadow
[55:22] see amen there's both light and darkness
[55:25] amen reflected see amen we we've got
[55:28] corruption yet we're we're we're full of
[55:31] interruption amen we got death amen
[55:34] within us yet we've got life within us
[55:37] ain't that right we're dying individuals
[55:40] but we know there's a life that's in us
[55:42] and we're Eternal beings that we cannot
[55:45] die amen see it's a shadow we are the
[55:49] Shadows so it's no more a dark Valley
[55:52] but it's a valley with a shadow in him
[55:55] he said you may be veiled here with the
[55:57] Flesh and with things known by faith but
[56:00] there's enough light that's in there
[56:02] ain't that right amen see so one of
[56:05] these days and this is what we're
[56:06] looking for amen that light and darkness
[56:09] won't be mixed together amen but they
[56:11] will actually separate oh I'm so looking
[56:14] forward to that amen the spirit of
[56:17] Darkness won't be there anymore or amen
[56:20] sickness won't be there anymore crying
[56:23] and the tears and the broken heart and
[56:25] the loneliness and the despair won't be
[56:27] there anymore the suffering and the pain
[56:30] and the agony won't be any there we'll
[56:32] be in light forever and the Darkness
[56:35] will flee but until then amen were in a
[56:39] shadow where there's light and darkness
[56:42] ain't that right amen that's why you can
[56:44] have the Holy Ghost to still go through
[56:46] your trials amen that's why you can have
[56:48] and be sealed with the Holy Ghost and
[56:51] Satan will put in your mind that you're
[56:52] lost and you're not going to make it and
[56:54] all of these things it's a shadow
[57:01] amen here
[57:04] we're walking in a shadow where there's
[57:06] light and darkness
[57:07] now notice Isaiah 60 and 1 rise Shine
[57:11] for thy lightest come and the glory of
[57:13] the Lord is risen upon thee that sounds
[57:16] wonderful ain't that right but that's
[57:19] not done in heaven that's not done it's
[57:21] done right here in Earth where there's
[57:24] Darkness because watch for Behold The
[57:26] Darkness shall cover the Earth and gross
[57:29] Darkness to people but the Lord shall
[57:31] rise upon thee and His glory shall be
[57:34] seen upon thee can you say amen amen but
[57:37] it doesn't take away the Mind battles it
[57:39] doesn't take away the pressure it
[57:41] doesn't take away that our sub bodies
[57:43] will get sick it doesn't take away the
[57:46] fact that you got to persevere it
[57:48] doesn't take away the fact that you got
[57:49] to keep a pressing on and you got to
[57:52] look to Christ amen and don't look to
[57:54] left to right you're in a valley a
[57:57] shadow of death
[57:58] yes sir that's right seeing the prophet
[58:01] said see if we're coping with the light
[58:03] of the day right the light of the day if
[58:08] you're walking in them lights Amen in in
[58:11] the paths of righteousness he said then
[58:13] we are shadows of light
[58:16] we're Shadows of light aren't you glad
[58:18] for that in a dark World we're Shadows
[58:21] amen and and I want to sit this way
[58:23] we're the what's making the shadow
[58:25] amen if it hadn't been for the people of
[58:28] God the children of line this world
[58:30] would be dark but there are shadows or
[58:33] there's lights Amen in this world that's
[58:36] making the shadow can you say man amen
[58:39] so now the prophet says you can look out
[58:41] and say well I I see the sun you know
[58:43] you see well you're not looking at the
[58:45] summit you're seeing the daylight amen
[58:47] you say well I see the sun well no in
[58:50] all reality you're seeing a reflection
[58:52] of the Sun
[58:55] ain't that right he said you see the
[58:58] shadow of the sun it's a reflection of
[58:59] the sun it isn't the sun itself but it
[59:02] proves that there is a sun it proves
[59:05] there is a son ain't that right well
[59:08] tonight we're moving tonight we you
[59:09] saying amen tonight we are clapping our
[59:12] hands raising our hands tonight all of
[59:14] these things which tells us that we're
[59:17] living ain't that right we're not dead
[59:19] we're not corpse we're living ain't that
[59:22] right seed but does the prophet said it
[59:25] can't be real life because it's got
[59:27] death in it
[59:29] we're living but it can't be real life
[59:32] because it's got death in it but notice
[59:36] what he says you're reflecting a lie
[59:39] from somewheres
[59:42] if you are a Christian this being a
[59:45] shadow it only proves that there is a
[59:47] life where you cannot die because this
[59:51] life has death in it but it's a shadow
[59:53] because you're living moving creature
[59:56] with abilities to see think move talk
[59:59] with the five senses of the body but yet
[1:00:01] you know they're dying
[1:00:03] ain't that right we're alive but our our
[1:00:07] hair is turning gray amen we're getting
[1:00:09] more wrinkled we're getting more feeble
[1:00:12] amen we're not as young brother Tim as
[1:00:14] we used to be amen see what is it we're
[1:00:17] alive but it's not the real life because
[1:00:21] there's death that is setting in so
[1:00:24] we're just a reflection see you know
[1:00:26] they're dying there's so much trouble
[1:00:28] you know see it's a reflection amen
[1:00:31] there's life and death that is mixed
[1:00:34] together
[1:00:35] he says in another place the physical
[1:00:37] has to die but if you are reflecting by
[1:00:41] your mortal life the light of heaven
[1:00:43] then you reflect in eternal life God
[1:00:46] ain't that right then when you die you
[1:00:49] can no more go to that line because
[1:00:51] that's what you've reflected if you're
[1:00:54] of the Dark World you reflect that and
[1:00:56] you and you can do or go no other way
[1:00:59] but to Darkness so we are in a
[1:01:02] reflection
[1:01:05] so we're walking through the valley of
[1:01:07] the shadow of death
[1:01:09] we're in a reflection see amen uh uh uh
[1:01:13] he said we so we see that and sure is
[1:01:16] the holy spirit Spirit reflects light
[1:01:19] and life so does death reflect Darkness
[1:01:25] ain't that right
[1:01:27] see so so he says see if I see a man
[1:01:30] walking fine looking young man in a few
[1:01:33] years watch his hair turn gray and slip
[1:01:36] out his shoulders droop down a beautiful
[1:01:38] young girl standing with a sainted Godly
[1:01:41] face on her and standing praising God I
[1:01:44] come back in a few years and find her
[1:01:46] Stoops shouldered packing two or three
[1:01:48] children well my see there it shows that
[1:01:52] in that body there is death
[1:01:57] he said no matter how well it is and how
[1:01:59] lovely it looks it's still got death in
[1:02:01] it he said now I watch which way that
[1:02:04] spirit in their leans if it's always
[1:02:07] representing the light speaking of the
[1:02:10] light talking of the light it'll go with
[1:02:12] the light
[1:02:13] oh Shadows
[1:02:15] ain't that right but if it's always on
[1:02:18] the other side of the world the things
[1:02:20] of the world influenced by the world
[1:02:21] there's nothing but it to turn into
[1:02:24] darkness when it dies into outer
[1:02:26] Darkness ain't that right so we are
[1:02:29] reflecting we are in a shadow here and
[1:02:33] and whatever you're reflecting amen uh
[1:02:36] or what your your your reflection of
[1:02:38] either light or Darkness see amen this
[1:02:41] why amen I look at the Christians and I
[1:02:43] see Death setting in I see the sickness
[1:02:45] and I see what the doctor says amen
[1:02:48] there's no hope and there's no this and
[1:02:50] there's no that and and and mortally uh
[1:02:53] uh humanly speaking there is no hope
[1:02:55] amen but they don't reflect that oh yeah
[1:02:58] their body speaks of it amen you see
[1:03:00] signs of of uh deterioration you see
[1:03:03] signs of whatever amen but then down
[1:03:06] inside they're reflecting an eternity
[1:03:11] and that's what every one of us is doing
[1:03:17] I hope I'm making sense to you I know
[1:03:20] it's simple but but hopefully it'll
[1:03:22] encourage you
[1:03:23] we are reflecting something
[1:03:30] that's right it'd be wonderful to stay
[1:03:32] in the atmosphere of Revival
[1:03:35] and when I say that I mean the meetings
[1:03:37] that we just had and and and everybody
[1:03:40] going to join together and and and and
[1:03:42] and such an atmosphere and all these
[1:03:45] things but but we know good and well
[1:03:46] that that that that's only temporary
[1:03:50] then we all go home and we all face our
[1:03:52] battles we all go back to the same
[1:03:54] humdrum of life
[1:03:56] ain't that right
[1:03:58] amen we Face the oppositions we Face the
[1:04:01] uh uh the daily tasks of life and in all
[1:04:04] of these things amen but still we are a
[1:04:08] reflection
[1:04:11] we are reflection
[1:04:13] now see so now if you're looking at
[1:04:16] nothing but a shadow
[1:04:18] and you've never seen the object but you
[1:04:21] just see the shadow
[1:04:23] then but yet we see that the object is
[1:04:26] making the shadow
[1:04:28] then you can still get the idea of what
[1:04:31] the object is
[1:04:34] and what it will be in reality by
[1:04:37] looking at the shadow
[1:04:39] for the shadow is only reflecting the
[1:04:43] object
[1:04:44] do you believe that
[1:04:45] I can look at you and see that there's a
[1:04:48] heaven
[1:04:52] I can look at you and see that there's a
[1:04:54] God
[1:04:56] I can look at you and see in your
[1:04:58] troubles and in your trials and know
[1:05:00] that there is a living reality to the
[1:05:03] things that we preach about
[1:05:07] and you say Amen
[1:05:08] amen he says now we know what Christ was
[1:05:11] as a shadow the way he manifested
[1:05:14] himself
[1:05:15] so isn't that something he's putting
[1:05:17] Christ as a shadow
[1:05:19] Christ being the Shadow and we're
[1:05:21] looking at Christ as the Shadow the way
[1:05:23] he manifested himself as a shadow he
[1:05:27] says now we know back there what he done
[1:05:29] now it must be reflected in US
[1:05:33] you understand what I'm saying he said
[1:05:35] it becometh us to fulfill all
[1:05:37] righteousness and we can look at that
[1:05:40] and then see a man that we are to do the
[1:05:43] same thing
[1:05:45] the gospel Christ the way he reflected
[1:05:48] it there the way he reflects it today
[1:05:51] ain't that right the way you reflected
[1:05:54] the gospel back then is the same way he
[1:05:56] reflects the gospel today not defeated
[1:05:59] not powerless but this gospel is nothing
[1:06:02] but Power
[1:06:05] this gospel is Victorious this gospel is
[1:06:08] an overcoming
[1:06:10] this gospel Reigns this gospel saves
[1:06:14] this Gospel Hill this gospel delivers
[1:06:18] there's power in the gospel he proved it
[1:06:21] and he's still proven it in US
[1:06:25] you believe it
[1:06:27] that makes him the same yesterday today
[1:06:29] and forever
[1:06:30] so God has commissioned us to fulfill
[1:06:33] all the word
[1:06:34] everybody say all the word
[1:06:36] eliteth me in the paths of righteousness
[1:06:39] no don't pick what path you take you're
[1:06:42] a sheep
[1:06:45] he's the shepherd
[1:06:47] he's doing the leading
[1:06:51] and sometimes we may look at it and say
[1:06:53] there's no way I can do it but if your
[1:06:54] sheep you'll follow
[1:06:58] and notice he leads us he's commissioned
[1:07:01] us to fulfill all the word for this day
[1:07:04] while we walk through this Valley of
[1:07:07] shadow of death
[1:07:12] but if you notice David said I will fear
[1:07:14] no evil
[1:07:16] for thou art with me
[1:07:18] I'll fear no evil
[1:07:20] are you with me walking through the
[1:07:23] valley of the shadow of death
[1:07:25] being led to these Paths of
[1:07:26] righteousness
[1:07:28] yet it tells us that there's going to be
[1:07:30] evil that tries to come upon you
[1:07:32] Satan gonna try to take you out he tried
[1:07:35] to take Jesus out every day
[1:07:39] ain't that right
[1:07:41] see but you know what when you're
[1:07:43] walking in the in the paths of
[1:07:44] righteousness do you realize you're in
[1:07:46] the line of duty
[1:07:48] you're in the line of duty fulfilling
[1:07:50] God's word is the line of duty for the
[1:07:53] believer
[1:07:55] right
[1:07:57] fulfilling see we we put all the
[1:08:00] sometime we put all of our energy and
[1:08:02] other things
[1:08:04] that you weren't called for other things
[1:08:07] yes you got to work but that's not what
[1:08:09] you're called for
[1:08:10] God didn't put you on on this Earth to
[1:08:12] be the electrician
[1:08:14] hello God didn't put you on this Earth
[1:08:17] to be the the world's billionaire
[1:08:21] God didn't put you on this Earth to do
[1:08:23] whatever he put you on this Earth if
[1:08:26] you're part of this bride you are
[1:08:28] predestinated to fulfill all the word
[1:08:33] ain't that right
[1:08:35] and he'll take you through whatever he
[1:08:37] wants to take you through to fulfill it
[1:08:40] that's his prerogative
[1:08:44] he took Jesus led him up on the mountain
[1:08:46] to be tempted that was part of the the
[1:08:48] plan
[1:08:50] ain't that right let him to the temple
[1:08:53] where Jesus could take the scriptures
[1:08:55] and say this day this scripture is
[1:08:57] fulfilled and leave all the priests
[1:08:59] perplexed but that was part of the plan
[1:09:02] he was led to Samara the Samaria amen
[1:09:05] for that little woman at the well but
[1:09:07] that was part of the plan
[1:09:09] he had a thousands of the five thousand
[1:09:12] not encounting children and and women
[1:09:14] and and and and he multiplied amen the
[1:09:17] fishes and Loaves that was part of the
[1:09:19] plan
[1:09:20] but he did not forsake the plan
[1:09:26] he wasn't looking for popularity
[1:09:28] that's why I was willing to leave them
[1:09:30] five thousand and go down or the fifteen
[1:09:32] thousand or whatever the thousands it
[1:09:34] was Amen to go down to that little woman
[1:09:36] at the well
[1:09:38] that's why he was willing Amen to go
[1:09:40] down to to Simon's house amen no one
[1:09:43] amen they didn't believe in him no and
[1:09:45] they were going to ridicule him but
[1:09:47] there was a lady there that was going to
[1:09:49] come to him
[1:09:51] it was part of the plan
[1:09:54] right
[1:09:55] part of the plan Golgotha was part of
[1:09:57] the plan Gethsemane was part of the plan
[1:10:01] being rejected was part of the plan
[1:10:06] and all that time
[1:10:09] he was in the line of duty
[1:10:11] you believe it
[1:10:13] you're in the line of duty when you're
[1:10:14] in Revival you're in the line of duty
[1:10:16] when you're not in Revival when you're
[1:10:18] fulfilling this word you're in the line
[1:10:20] of duty
[1:10:23] sometimes we think God changes his mind
[1:10:25] on things
[1:10:27] and we begin to think that when
[1:10:29] everything is not going as well
[1:10:34] I don't know if you've ever had problems
[1:10:37] with
[1:10:39] things going well Money in the Bank
[1:10:42] driving the nice new car
[1:10:46] and everything just hunky-dory
[1:10:49] ever you're receiving the applauds of
[1:10:52] men
[1:10:53] your boss is just you know giving you a
[1:10:55] raise
[1:10:56] giving you a new position
[1:10:59] and I don't know if you've ever had that
[1:11:01] problem when all that's going on to say
[1:11:03] I wonder
[1:11:04] I just don't know if this is the will of
[1:11:06] God
[1:11:07] usually we always attach these things to
[1:11:10] God blessing
[1:11:12] God approving
[1:11:14] God God uh God's with us
[1:11:18] God's sign of love
[1:11:22] and it's usually when we're struggling
[1:11:25] when the money dwindles when the boss
[1:11:27] ain't just so favorable
[1:11:30] when everybody's not packing us on the
[1:11:33] back
[1:11:35] and we're struggling in life
[1:11:37] it's usually then that we start
[1:11:39] questioning
[1:11:42] can you say Amen
[1:11:44] but see if he's the shepherd and you're
[1:11:46] the Sheep
[1:11:47] he's going to lead you wherever he wants
[1:11:50] to
[1:11:51] because it's the paths of right this
[1:11:54] word must be fulfilled
[1:11:57] the word must be fulfilled it takes the
[1:12:00] struggles it takes the battles for
[1:12:02] victories
[1:12:05] ain't that right
[1:12:09] so as long as as Moses was fulfilling
[1:12:13] the commission that God gave him then he
[1:12:16] was in the line of duty
[1:12:17] the prophet said see he was in the line
[1:12:19] of duty because he was trying to achieve
[1:12:21] something for the glory of God
[1:12:26] now remember he tried to do it he tried
[1:12:28] to achieve something without the will of
[1:12:29] God
[1:12:30] without a revelation but he had gotten
[1:12:33] the revelation
[1:12:34] he had received his Commission
[1:12:37] now I put him in the line of duty
[1:12:41] is that right
[1:12:43] brother Brown said no matter how bad it
[1:12:45] was how evil it looked and how much it
[1:12:47] was talked about the spirit in Moses
[1:12:49] directed him straight to the line of
[1:12:52] duty
[1:12:53] it was the spirit in Moses that directed
[1:12:56] him straight to that line of duty
[1:13:00] that's true and the Holy Spirit Will
[1:13:02] direct you
[1:13:05] got the Holy Ghost it'll direct you
[1:13:08] do the line of duty
[1:13:10] ain't that right
[1:13:12] yes sir
[1:13:14] brother Brown said if you see a person
[1:13:16] with a great gift trying to do something
[1:13:17] to glorify themselves
[1:13:19] your own discernment of the spirit tells
[1:13:21] you that's wrong
[1:13:23] and see and that that's how you discern
[1:13:25] spirits
[1:13:27] you don't judge the man you judge the
[1:13:28] spirit that's in that man
[1:13:30] no matter what gift they've got no
[1:13:32] matter how anointed they are no matter
[1:13:34] what if they're trying to glorify
[1:13:36] themselves with that gift that's the
[1:13:38] wrong thing for the spirit of God will
[1:13:40] lead you straight in the line of duty
[1:13:42] Amen to walk the paths of righteousness
[1:13:45] to fulfill the word of God can you say
[1:13:48] Amen
[1:13:49] and remember when Moses received his
[1:13:51] commission it didn't take the enemy away
[1:13:52] from him
[1:13:54] it didn't take away the fact that there
[1:13:56] was a threat on Moses's life you didn't
[1:13:58] take away the obstacles from Moses
[1:14:02] can you say Amen
[1:14:04] and so is it today Church you're called
[1:14:07] to reflect Jesus Christ on this on this
[1:14:11] Earth
[1:14:15] not in heaven
[1:14:19] not when the devil's chained up by a
[1:14:22] chains of circumstance
[1:14:26] but while you're walking in this Valley
[1:14:28] of shadow of death
[1:14:32] can you say Amen you're called to
[1:14:34] reflect so it doesn't take away the
[1:14:37] obstacles we Face your faith is going to
[1:14:39] be challenged
[1:14:42] your your jaw is going to be challenged
[1:14:45] your your stand is going to be
[1:14:47] challenged
[1:14:50] you want me tested and try it
[1:14:52] let's look at it Exodus 14 and 1. is
[1:14:55] this all right
[1:14:57] and the Lord spake unto Moses saying
[1:14:59] Speak unto the children of Israel that
[1:15:01] they turn and encamped before
[1:15:04] uh that word
[1:15:07] it's a certain place between mcdole and
[1:15:10] the Sea over against Bale zephon before
[1:15:14] it you shall shall you encamp by the sea
[1:15:18] for Pharaoh now notice for Pharaoh will
[1:15:21] save the children of Israel they are
[1:15:22] entangled in the land
[1:15:24] the Wilderness hath shut them in
[1:15:27] now God's leading them on the paths of
[1:15:29] righteousness
[1:15:30] Moses was commissioned he received the
[1:15:32] revelation of god of what he was going
[1:15:34] to do but God was still in charge
[1:15:38] ain't that right God doesn't give you a
[1:15:41] commission and then he just leaves you
[1:15:42] up to figure it out he's still in charge
[1:15:45] and he's leading that notice where he's
[1:15:47] leading them and he already knows that
[1:15:50] when they get there Pharaoh is going to
[1:15:53] respond to this
[1:15:57] and he'll say of the children of Israel
[1:15:59] they're entangled in the land the
[1:16:00] Wilderness has shut them in and I will
[1:16:04] harden Pharaoh's heart
[1:16:07] that he shall follow after them and I
[1:16:09] will be honored upon pharaoh and upon
[1:16:12] all his hosts that the Egyptians may
[1:16:14] know that I am the Lord and they did so
[1:16:18] and it was told the king of Egypt that
[1:16:20] the people fled and the Heart of pharaoh
[1:16:22] and of his servants was turned against
[1:16:24] the people and they said why have we
[1:16:26] done this that we have let Israel go
[1:16:29] from serving us God Harden the heart
[1:16:32] and he made ready his Chariot and took
[1:16:35] his people with him and he took 600
[1:16:37] chosen chariots and all the Chariots of
[1:16:39] Egypt and captains over every one of
[1:16:42] them and the Lord hardened the heart of
[1:16:44] pharaoh king of Egypt and he pursued
[1:16:47] after the children of Israel and the
[1:16:49] children of Israel went out with an high
[1:16:51] hand
[1:16:52] but the Egyptians pursued after them all
[1:16:55] the horses and Chariots of pharaoh and
[1:16:57] the horsemen and his army overtook them
[1:17:00] in camping by the Sea besides uh beside
[1:17:04] that place before belzephon
[1:17:07] so see when a Believer is in the line of
[1:17:10] duty
[1:17:11] mark it down all hell
[1:17:14] comes after him
[1:17:16] all hell is against him
[1:17:18] take your stand upon the mess of the
[1:17:21] hour and you watch all hell will come
[1:17:24] against you start for what start not
[1:17:26] just Amen in the message of the hour but
[1:17:29] start applying it to your life
[1:17:32] start confessing what God says about it
[1:17:34] today start believing in it start acting
[1:17:37] upon it and watch all hell come against
[1:17:39] you
[1:17:42] see we then become a target for the
[1:17:44] enemy
[1:17:46] for you young sisters
[1:17:50] any of you ladies but brother Brian said
[1:17:53] young ladies
[1:17:55] he said these little girls here
[1:17:57] beautiful little things
[1:17:59] see you brought up you're brought up to
[1:18:01] here to have long hair and dress right
[1:18:04] but you will be a target for Satan
[1:18:10] is that right
[1:18:12] just just teaching our children
[1:18:15] the the right way makes them a Target
[1:18:19] for the devil
[1:18:21] sure does
[1:18:24] then he tells you keep the power of God
[1:18:27] over you all the time
[1:18:30] don't never let it leave
[1:18:33] this great precious Jewel that God has
[1:18:36] come into your hearts by the baptism of
[1:18:38] the Holy Ghost given this happy enjoying
[1:18:42] another place brother Brown says he
[1:18:44] talks about brother Carlson he says he
[1:18:46] just made a statement that these
[1:18:48] ministers Ministries what they've had to
[1:18:50] go through to make them Ministries
[1:18:52] and how true Brother Joseph standing by
[1:18:55] me he said well he said if you're not a
[1:18:58] soldier then you're not shot at
[1:19:02] if you're just playing Church you're not
[1:19:04] shot at
[1:19:06] if you're just going along with the
[1:19:09] popular vote and opinions you're not
[1:19:12] shot at
[1:19:13] you're just going the way that everybody
[1:19:16] goes you're not shot at
[1:19:20] and you say Amen
[1:19:22] he said I thought that was pretty well
[1:19:24] placed for that's right and as the
[1:19:28] battles rage why you become a real
[1:19:31] Target
[1:19:33] see As Time and
[1:19:36] Eternity come together you're becoming
[1:19:39] the target brother Bill
[1:19:43] hope you understand
[1:19:46] because Satan is doing his best to
[1:19:47] defeat God's purpose
[1:19:50] now we already know that he ain't going
[1:19:52] to be able to do it
[1:19:57] but what did the prophet say he'll get
[1:19:59] you to doubt your weapon
[1:20:01] which is the word of God
[1:20:03] he'll get you to doubt these promises
[1:20:05] and you know how good and well he does
[1:20:06] it he gets you to doubt the fact that
[1:20:10] them belong to you
[1:20:13] I know God is real
[1:20:15] I know God Saves I know God's going to
[1:20:17] have a bride
[1:20:18] but where he comes down to is you
[1:20:23] to where you begin to question but is it
[1:20:25] for me
[1:20:30] how many's ever had that happen
[1:20:33] you've had it happen
[1:20:36] what is it you become a Target
[1:20:41] he says see there's only one thing to do
[1:20:45] only one thing to do
[1:20:47] put on the whole armor of faith
[1:20:50] stand true to God
[1:20:52] and March forward
[1:20:56] ain't that right that's all God's Army
[1:21:00] does not retreat
[1:21:04] it goes on
[1:21:06] many of them drop off to the side and
[1:21:08] start this that or the other but the
[1:21:10] army of God marches forward we're going
[1:21:13] right on and on
[1:21:16] how many is going on
[1:21:18] by the grace of God we're going on
[1:21:24] see you're walking you're walking
[1:21:26] through this Valley of shadow of death
[1:21:28] but yet he's leading you in these Paths
[1:21:31] of righteousness
[1:21:33] you realize the bride
[1:21:36] you're a people
[1:21:39] on the Earth the only ones on the earth
[1:21:41] and when I say you I'm talking about
[1:21:43] worldwide bride of Christ the only
[1:21:46] people and very few they are
[1:21:49] that has actually been able to fulfill
[1:21:51] the word
[1:21:52] for this age
[1:21:54] you're the completion of the book
[1:21:57] you're the completion of God's mind
[1:22:01] you're the finale you're the Final Touch
[1:22:08] they try to do it that churches have
[1:22:10] tried to try to manufacture it it
[1:22:13] couldn't happen
[1:22:17] but Satan can't take you and that's what
[1:22:19] makes you the biggest target
[1:22:24] someone asked brother Brown said is it
[1:22:26] possible for a holy ghost-filled person
[1:22:27] to be driven by or to do minor things
[1:22:31] influenced to do minor things that he
[1:22:33] doesn't want to do oh yes
[1:22:35] everybody say oh yes
[1:22:37] oh yes
[1:22:39] you mean a holy ghost-filled person
[1:22:41] sealed up
[1:22:43] can can do minor things that he he
[1:22:46] doesn't want to do oh yeah yes sir y'all
[1:22:49] Holy Ghost filled person you're right in
[1:22:52] the place to be droved by these things
[1:22:55] you just put yourself up a Target
[1:22:59] right
[1:23:00] when you were when you're down there
[1:23:02] serving the devil he just lets you
[1:23:05] slouch around any old way you want to
[1:23:07] if you're looking to slouch around if
[1:23:09] you're looking for an easy life if
[1:23:11] you're looking for a way of just to
[1:23:13] relax everybody wants to go Bahamas
[1:23:15] everybody wants to go somewhere is to
[1:23:17] relax you ain't going to relax if you're
[1:23:19] a Christian
[1:23:20] our peace is on the other side
[1:23:26] our rest is in that Millennium God
[1:23:28] promised a millennium that this world
[1:23:30] knows nothing of
[1:23:32] the prophet said they're trying to make
[1:23:34] a millennium without repentance they'll
[1:23:35] never make it
[1:23:37] they're trying to come up with World
[1:23:39] Peace it'll never happen
[1:23:41] they're trying to bring a piece that
[1:23:42] they're searching for something it'll
[1:23:44] never be it belongs to you but it's not
[1:23:47] until we get on that other side right
[1:23:50] now you're in the valley of shadow of
[1:23:52] death
[1:23:58] when you're down there serving the deli
[1:24:00] just let you slouch any old way you want
[1:24:01] to but once you take a stand for Christ
[1:24:04] you've got on the other side then and he
[1:24:07] trains every gun right around on you
[1:24:11] every Temptation everything that could
[1:24:13] be thrown to you then you got it
[1:24:16] but what have you got
[1:24:19] greater is he that is in you
[1:24:23] I will fear no evil for thou art with me

[1:27:46] gonna fight face the enemy but don't
[1:27:48] despair
[1:27:50] keep walking the paths of righteousness
[1:27:53] ain't that right
[1:27:58] it's true
[1:28:00] you know it's kind of funny
[1:28:03] there's times you know there's Seasons
[1:28:05] that we you know you can have seasons of
[1:28:07] prayer how many just has seasons of
[1:28:09] Prayer
[1:28:10] and when you pray you just feel the
[1:28:12] spirit of God there
[1:28:15] it's awesome
[1:28:18] it's in the times then you have them
[1:28:20] Seasons that prayer becomes a challenge
[1:28:26] becomes difficult
[1:28:29] you don't feel God there
[1:28:32] it's almost as if the prayers yours the
[1:28:34] words you're saying just hit in the
[1:28:36] ceiling if it even hits the ceiling
[1:28:40] but it's in them times that you start
[1:28:42] questioning now what did I do wrong
[1:28:45] what do I need to do
[1:28:49] has the Lord left me
[1:28:51] you know
[1:28:52] am I getting anywhere you are getting
[1:28:54] somewheres
[1:28:58] right
[1:29:00] yeah but what is it it's Satan coming to
[1:29:04] attack
[1:29:07] that you pray as a soldier
[1:29:09] you read your Bible as a soldier you
[1:29:12] come and you worship as a soldier
[1:29:16] you come and sing songs as a soldier you
[1:29:20] come and even a man the word as a
[1:29:22] soldier
[1:29:24] I didn't feel like coming tonight but I
[1:29:26] came as a soldier
[1:29:28] I didn't want to stand here tonight but
[1:29:29] I stand in here as a soldier I didn't
[1:29:32] know what to preach but here I am
[1:29:34] preaching as a soldier
[1:29:37] didn't you say Amen we get discouraged a
[1:29:40] lot
[1:29:41] many times because the devil is on our
[1:29:44] tail
[1:29:46] but that shows that there's something
[1:29:48] you know isn't it I don't know if the
[1:29:51] prophet said or someone said it the
[1:29:52] devil ain't bad news because he's
[1:29:54] already got you
[1:29:55] if he's fighting you it shows He Ain't
[1:29:57] Got You Yet
[1:30:01] ain't that right
[1:30:02] so you go back to Exodus the 14th
[1:30:05] chapter the 10th verse and when Pharaoh
[1:30:08] drew nighth the children of Israel
[1:30:09] lifted up their eyes and behold the
[1:30:12] Egyptians marched after them and they
[1:30:14] were sore afraid see and the children of
[1:30:17] Israel Cried Out unto the Lord and they
[1:30:19] said unto Moses because there were no
[1:30:21] graves in Egypt has thou taken his way
[1:30:23] to die in the wilderness
[1:30:25] wherefore hast thou dealt with us uh uh
[1:30:28] thus with us to carry us forth out of
[1:30:30] Egypt is not this the word that we did
[1:30:33] tell thee in Egypt saying let us alone
[1:30:36] that we may serve the Egyptians see
[1:30:38] people fall apart in the trials
[1:30:41] they were all rejoicing when they when
[1:30:44] the enemy wasn't chasing them
[1:30:47] people get discomforted they get dis you
[1:30:50] know they get uh disoriented
[1:30:53] you can't get disoriented when the
[1:30:55] battle's hot
[1:31:00] so he says is this not is not this the
[1:31:02] word that we did tell thee in Egypt
[1:31:04] saying let us alone that we may serve
[1:31:06] the Egyptians it had been better for us
[1:31:08] to serve the Egyptian than the way we sh
[1:31:11] then then that we should die in the
[1:31:13] wilderness and how many people look back
[1:31:15] and say it would have been better for us
[1:31:16] to stay out in the world than to be what
[1:31:18] we are us miserable riches
[1:31:21] if you consider being a miserable wretch
[1:31:24] and doing the will of God something's
[1:31:25] wrong
[1:31:27] but we get so used to the battle and
[1:31:29] we're looking at the Battle we're
[1:31:31] looking at the enemy and we begin to
[1:31:33] look back and say that's better than
[1:31:34] where we're at today you'll never be
[1:31:37] better back there
[1:31:45] people look back and say well you know I
[1:31:47] I never had trouble in denominations I
[1:31:49] never had this much
[1:31:51] but here I am I'm miserable I've lost
[1:31:54] everything I'm going through this battle
[1:31:55] in this battle in that battle in that
[1:31:57] battle you know it would have been
[1:31:59] better would it
[1:32:01] and here they are looking at the message
[1:32:05] of the hours and it had been better for
[1:32:07] us to stay back there but you brought us
[1:32:08] here
[1:32:12] but notice what the prophet said about
[1:32:14] Moses he was exactly in the line of duty
[1:32:16] leading the children across to the Red
[1:32:18] Sea and was taken them to the promised
[1:32:20] land as God had promised
[1:32:22] he heard from God the Holy Spirit was
[1:32:25] upon him he led them out done Miracles
[1:32:27] and signs of God and here they was right
[1:32:30] in the line of duty and there was every
[1:32:33] that could be
[1:32:34] shove it off it seemed as nature would
[1:32:37] even itself cry out all Moses and Israel
[1:32:40] I feel sorry for you because Doom just
[1:32:44] Waits you
[1:32:46] they were an awful fix
[1:32:49] but notice
[1:32:50] as I close
[1:32:53] 13th verse and Moses said unto the
[1:32:55] people fear ye not
[1:32:58] can you say that with me fear ye not
[1:33:01] stand still
[1:33:03] and see the salvation of the Lord
[1:33:06] which he will show you today
[1:33:09] for the Egyptians whom you have seen
[1:33:11] today you shall see them again no more
[1:33:13] forever the Lord shall fight for you and
[1:33:17] you shall hold your peace and the Lord
[1:33:20] said unto Moses wherefore Christ thou
[1:33:22] unto me speak unto the children of
[1:33:24] Israel that they go forward
[1:33:28] can you say Amen and the prophet said
[1:33:31] when the children of Israel was
[1:33:32] following their commission going
[1:33:34] straight in the line of duty that red
[1:33:36] the Red Sea got in the way of the line
[1:33:38] of duty of the children of Israel going
[1:33:40] to a promised land and God looked down
[1:33:42] through the pillar of fire and the Sea
[1:33:44] got scared and opened up away and they
[1:33:47] crossed over as on dry land
[1:33:51] church do you believe God's still with
[1:33:52] us he's still the same God he is with
[1:33:56] those who are following in the line of
[1:33:59] duty
[1:34:00] God is with you God Is With Us God's
[1:34:03] with this church
[1:34:07] if the musicians will come
[1:34:11] why does the supernatural stay with the
[1:34:13] people of God
[1:34:15] because they're in the line of duty
[1:34:18] and again the line of duty ain't there
[1:34:20] ain't fulfilling the lust of their flesh
[1:34:22] they ain't fulfilling what they want to
[1:34:23] do
[1:34:25] they're fulfilling the predestinated
[1:34:27] word of God for their lives
[1:34:29] and Satan hates it
[1:34:34] you think of all the people you think of
[1:34:35] all the churches you think of all all
[1:34:37] through history
[1:34:38] Satan's been able to get get every one
[1:34:41] of them
[1:34:42] I thought like you sisters you know
[1:34:44] brother Brown said the sisters a woman
[1:34:47] has been the main target
[1:34:50] since History of Time
[1:34:54] he got eve and he's been getting them in
[1:34:56] every age brother Brown said he's been
[1:34:58] getting every woman getting the women in
[1:35:00] every age but you know what in this age
[1:35:02] there's a group of sisters that ain't
[1:35:04] going to bow
[1:35:06] there's a group of sisters that the
[1:35:08] devil can't touch
[1:35:09] there's a group of sisters that is is
[1:35:12] coming to the completion of God's
[1:35:14] thoughts
[1:35:16] and Satan hates it
[1:35:19] well that's with the people of God
[1:35:22] you realize he's been able to pervert
[1:35:24] every Revival
[1:35:26] and he ain't able to pervert this one
[1:35:30] the bride Revival it's a word Revival
[1:35:33] and he hates it and Satan hates it
[1:35:36] and he's doing everything I mean believe
[1:35:39] me this if I may not be able to word it
[1:35:43] right but brother Brown said this is the
[1:35:45] age
[1:35:46] we're all hell
[1:35:48] all hell is emptied out it's here
[1:35:52] every demon of hell is here on Earth
[1:35:55] this is the age
[1:35:57] and you're fighting them you're you're
[1:35:59] the target
[1:36:01] but it's already been written
[1:36:03] you will overcome
[1:36:05] you will complete it you will finish
[1:36:07] this race and Satan ain't got no say so
