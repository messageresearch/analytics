[31:18] when we all
[31:20] see Jesus
[31:23] [music and singing] will sing and shout
[31:25] the victory.
[31:28] Oh, when we all

[31:52] [singing]
[31:53] get to heaven. [music]
[31:56] What a day of rejoicing [singing]
[31:58] that will be
[32:01] when we all
[32:04] see Jesus. [singing]
[32:06] We'll sing and [music] shout victory.
[32:11] Amen. Praise the Lord. Happy to be here
[32:14] today. You know, my wife came to me last
[32:16] night and she showed me your
[32:17] announcement and it right down at the
[32:19] bottom it said casual dress for the
[32:22] service. That is one of the hardest
[32:24] things for me to do. [laughter]
[32:26] Ever since I was a little boy, I had to
[32:28] wear a coat and tie to church. Then I
[32:30] got in sales and I had to wear a coat
[32:32] and tie. So, I feel undressed. But I'm
[32:35] happy to be here casual and all. Amen.
[32:38] I'm gonna I'm gonna sing that little
[32:40] song. Glory. Glory. Hallelujah. First,
[32:42] is it all right if I give a little
[32:43] testimony?
[32:46] You know, uh, I've been studying over
[32:47] the last year or so. The prophet of God
[32:50] said, "The way for a for the Gentile to
[32:54] receive from God is to receive it as the
[32:57] word's going forth." And I've thought
[33:00] about that and I've thought about that,
[33:02] but it seems like we very seldom see
[33:04] that. Although we may be, we just don't
[33:06] see it. It may happen. But um earlier
[33:09] this year for a couple months I had a
[33:13] problem with my leg. Couldn't walk in
[33:16] pain. Just really a lot of pain. I
[33:18] thought well going to have to go get a
[33:20] hip replacement or something. But you
[33:22] know I've been thinking about that that
[33:24] quote. And so I started going to church
[33:27] and every service I'd come I'd come out
[33:31] of that service expecting to be healed
[33:32] because I heard the word go forth.
[33:34] That's what he said. And I mean 8 weeks,
[33:36] 10 weeks, 12 weeks.
[33:39] And I had to get I I had to get relief
[33:42] because I had to travel to Spain to
[33:44] preach a convention and then we were
[33:45] going from there to Portugal to preach
[33:47] and uh I just needed to be able to walk.
[33:51] So about I think it was 10 days before I
[33:53] was to leave for Europe, I was in uh the
[33:56] Hardy meetings with brother Benuit.
[33:59] They had a prayer line and brother uh
[34:02] Daryl Ward and brother my pastor,
[34:03] brother Josh Bennett was there and as I
[34:05] went through that prayer line, they laid
[34:07] hands on me and I just felt like I was
[34:09] healed all of a sudden.
[34:10] &gt;&gt; The Lord.
[34:11] &gt;&gt; Well, I didn't really know for sure. I
[34:13] didn't have any pain anymore. But I went
[34:15] home and they was having a graduation
[34:17] party for one of the boys in the church.
[34:19] They was in a gym. They said, "Come on,
[34:21] brother Kenny. Play basketball with us."
[34:23] And you know, I didn't give it a second
[34:24] thought. I said, "Sure, I'll come." You
[34:26] know what? I had no pain. Have no pain
[34:28] since then. But I I thank God and I
[34:31] thank God for the words of a prophet.
[34:33] Know sometimes if WE WOULD JUST APPLY
[34:35] those words, we'd be no telling what we
[34:38] could receive.
[34:39] &gt;&gt; So I'm thank God for that. Just help me
[34:40] sing this if you know it. Well, glory,
[34:43] glory.
[34:44] Hallelujah.
[34:47] Since I laid
[34:49] my burdens down.
[34:52] Well, glory, glory. [music] Well,
[34:54] hallelujah. [singing]
[34:57] Since I laid
[34:59] my burdens down. [singing and music]
[35:02] Well, I am feeling
[35:04] so much better.

[35:29] my burdens down, [music]
[35:31] well, glory, glory. [singing]
[35:34] Hallelujah.

[35:39] my burdens [music and singing] down,
[35:41] well, I am feeling
[35:44] so much better.

[35:49] [music] my burdens down.
[35:51] Well, I'm feeling [music]

[36:12] glory. [singing]
[36:14] Hallelujah.
[36:16] Since I laid [music]
[36:19] burdens down,
[36:21] well, I'm thankful [music]
[36:24] for the message. [singing]
[36:26] Since I laid [music] those burdens down,
[36:31] well, I'm so thankful
[36:34] for the message. [singing]
[36:36] [music] Since I laid
[36:38] my burdens down.
[36:41] Oh, glory, [music and singing] glory.

[36:48] [music] my burdens down,
[36:51] well, go. [singing]
[36:54] Hallelujah.
[36:56] Since I laid
[36:58] those burdens down. [singing and music]
[37:01] Hallelujah. God bless you. [applause]
[37:12] It ain't nothing. [music] It ain't
[37:14] nothing for you. [singing]
[37:17] I may stumble, [music]
[37:19] stumble in everything I do. Oh,
[37:23] [singing] I may worry, hold my [music]
[37:26] breath till my face turns blue. But it
[37:29] ain't nothing. [music] It ain't nothing
[37:32] for you.
[37:34] Now [singing]
[37:35] the children [music]
[37:37] had their backs to that Red Sea.
[37:40] And oh Pharaoh, [singing]
[37:42] it looked like he [music] had the
[37:44] victory, but the waters rolled on
[37:48] [music] back with the [singing] breath
[37:50] you blew. And it ain't nothing. It ain't
[37:54] nothing for you. [singing]
[37:56] Oh Joshua, he took a [music] walk around
[38:01] Jero. [singing]
[38:03] And Lord, you told him, [music] you told
[38:05] him that the wall would go. Oh, and it
[38:09] crumbled [music]
[38:11] at the shout when the trumpets blew. And
[38:14] [singing] it ain't nothing. It ain't
[38:17] nothing [music] for you.
[38:19] Oh, [singing]
[38:20] it ain't nothing. It ain't nothing for
[38:23] [music] you.

[38:29] I do. [music]
[38:30] [singing] Oh, I may worry, hold my
[38:34] breath till my face [singing] turns
[38:35] blue. But it [music] ain't nothing. It
[38:39] ain't nothing for you. [singing]
[38:42] Now I was lonely. Sin [music] had broken
[38:46] my heart in two. Oh, all the pieces
[38:49] [singing]
[38:50] I couldn't [music] mend with the
[38:52] strongest glue. But Lord Jesus, you took
[38:56] the pieces [singing] and made me new.
[38:59] Oh, it ain't nothing. Can we sing that
[39:02] [music] fifth verse now?
[39:04] Now this body, it's slowly dying without

[39:20] [music and singing] in. Oh, it ain't
[39:23] nothing. It ain't nothing for you. Oh,
[39:27] [singing]
[39:27] it ain't nothing. [music] It ain't
[39:30] nothing for you.
[39:32] Oh, [singing] I may falter, [music]
[39:35] stumble in everything I do. Oh, I may
[39:39] worry and [singing] hold my [music]
[39:41] breath till my face turns blue. But it
[39:44] ain't nothing. It ain't. Can we sing it
[39:47] again now? Oh, [singing and music]
[39:50] it ain't nothing. It ain't nothing for
[39:53] you. Can you stand? Oh, I may falter,

[40:25] hold my breath till my face turns blue.
[40:28] But it ain't nothing. [singing]
[40:30] [music] It ain't nothing for you.
[40:33] Now this body, it's slowly dying without
[40:38] him. But I [music] ain't worried though.
[40:42] The skin worms eat my skin. Oh, cuz
[40:45] you'll open [music] heaven's [singing]
[40:47] doors and I'll walk right in. Oh, it
[40:50] ain't nothing. It ain't [music] one more
[40:53] time as our pastor comes. [singing]
[40:55] Oh, it ain't nothing. It ain't nothing
[40:59] for you.
[41:01] I may fall [music] st
[41:10] my face turns blue but it ain't nothing.
[41:14] Well, aren't you glad for that? Can we
[41:16] sing [music] it once again? Oh,
[41:17] [singing] it ain't nothing.
[41:20] It ain't nothing for you.
[41:23] Oh, I may falter, [music and singing]
[41:25] stumble in everything I do. And I may
[41:29] worry, hold my breath till my face
[41:32] [music] turns blue. But it [singing]
[41:34] ain't nothing. It ain't nothing for you.
[41:39] Well, can you give the Lord a hand clap
[41:41] of praise?
[41:43] [applause and music]
[41:44] Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[41:48] I tell you what, there is nothing that
[41:51] God cannot do.
[41:53] &gt;&gt; He's just God. Amen. I tell you, I I
[41:57] know, you know, fear is striking the
[41:59] land and and the spirit of fear tries to
[42:01] get on the people of God, but you know,
[42:03] we ain't got nothing to be afraid about.
[42:06] &gt;&gt; We got a bright future and there ain't
[42:08] nothing that the devil can do to stop
[42:10] us. And I tell you, I I appreciate you
[42:13] giving that testimony, Brother Kenny.
[42:15] Amen. And I believe that's just how we
[42:16] receive things from God is just simply
[42:20] believe. If God said it, I think
[42:23] sometimes we we look if we think, well,
[42:25] the word, you know, we look for someone
[42:27] to give a word in prophecy, you know, or
[42:31] someone to speak something, you know, in
[42:33] a vision or or in a dream, and we look
[42:36] that to be the word. But the word has
[42:37] been preached every service. Every time
[42:40] you're listening to them tapes, the word
[42:42] is being preached. Every time a man of
[42:44] God stands behind the pulpit, the word
[42:46] is being preached. Why not expect it
[42:49] what you need?
[42:50] &gt;&gt; Get what you need. The word is that
[42:53] powerful. Can you say amen?
[42:56] &gt;&gt; Well, do you love the Lord?
[42:58] &gt;&gt; You can be seated for just a moment. I
[43:00] just want to say um uh we just uh
[43:04] appreciate all the you visitors for
[43:06] coming. Amen. and being part of our
[43:10] service and our day and looking forward
[43:12] to a a wonderful time of fellowship uh
[43:16] today and um um and looking forward to a
[43:21] wonderful time today as as uh the man of
[43:24] God getting ready to to preach the word
[43:26] of the Lord to us. And you know, it it
[43:29] don't matter how simple or how deep or
[43:32] whatever. The word of God is powerful.
[43:35] &gt;&gt; And we we know that it's it's it's not a
[43:39] man that just just decides to have a
[43:42] gift. It's God that puts that gift in
[43:45] that man. And because God wants to speak
[43:49] through him to the people. And um I I
[43:54] don't believe that this service is by
[43:55] accident. And um um I don't believe that
[44:00] um that Josh is here today uh to preach
[44:04] to us by accident. I just believe that
[44:06] God wants to speak to us. And um and so
[44:10] what we are been taught by the prophet
[44:13] is just pull on the gift. Amen. And and
[44:17] look beyond the veil of flesh and just
[44:20] say, "God, you know my needs. You know
[44:23] exactly where I'm at. would you just
[44:25] minister to me today? And I've had God
[44:28] do that many times. And uh that's just
[44:31] where God is. He He knows exactly where
[44:34] we're at. And we may say, "Well, I I'm
[44:37] just so dark in a in a dark situation
[44:39] that God just doesn't know." He knows
[44:41] exactly where you're at,
[44:43] &gt;&gt; and he knows how to meet that need. And
[44:46] and so we want Brother Josh just to um
[44:50] uh take his liberty. uh brother uh be my
[44:53] nephew Josh Martin and want him to take
[44:56] his liberty. But I do want to say I
[44:58] appreciate those of you that have driven
[45:01] uh a ways uh to come and uh make this uh
[45:05] a good day for us. And we just always
[45:08] love company and uh we we'll try to
[45:11] treat you u well we'll we'll we'll try
[45:15] to treat you in a way you don't want to
[45:16] leave. Amen. and uh maybe you'll take
[45:19] some fire with you and and share it to
[45:22] your church and wherever you're at and
[45:25] uh but we can just stand to our feet.
[45:27] Let's just sing this that little song.
[45:29] Blessed be the name of the Lord. You are
[45:31] worthy to be praised and adored.
[45:34] Amen.
[45:37] Oh, blessed be the name of the Lord.
[45:45] [music] You are worthy [singing] to be
[45:48] praised
[45:49] and adored. [music]
[45:53] So we lift up. Aren't you glad you can
[45:56] lift up holy [music] hands
[45:59] who made you holy? It's a holy God
[46:02] that's living in you. [music]
[46:05] Oh, blessed be the [singing] name.
[46:09] Blessed [music]
[46:10] be the name
[46:12] of the Lord. Sing it unto him. Oh,
[46:16] [singing] blessed [music]
[46:19] be the name of the Lord.
[46:23] You are [singing] worthy to be [music]
[46:26] praised and adored.
[46:31] So we lift [music and singing] up holy
[46:34] hands.
[46:36] Yes. [singing and music]
[46:38] Singing blessing.
[46:47] So be [music and singing] the name of
[46:50] the Lord. Can we sing that one more time
[46:52] now?
[46:55] Be [music and singing] the name.
[47:02] It's worthy to be praised [music]
[47:06] and [singing] adored.
[47:10] Lift up holy hands [singing]
[47:13] [music] one accord.
[47:17] Blessed [singing] be the name. [music]
[47:21] Blessed be the name.
[47:24] Blessed be [singing] the name of [music]
[47:28] the Lord.
[47:31] Amen. I trust you have a praise upon
[47:33] your lips this morning. [music]
[47:35] Amen. I believe God's been good to us.
[47:38] blessed us with unsearchable riches.
[47:41] [music]
[47:41] And I believe that as brother Brandon
[47:43] would say, if he never did one more
[47:45] thing for me, he's already done enough
[47:47] for me. And I believe that that's our
[47:50] confession as well. He saved our souls,
[47:52] filled us with the Holy Ghost, given us
[47:54] a message that has placed us in our
[47:56] inheritance. And I believe if anybody
[47:59] has a right to praise the Lord, it's the
[48:01] bride [music] of Christ. Amen. Well, God
[48:03] bless you this morning. It's it's good
[48:05] to be with y'all today. appreciate the
[48:07] opportunity [music] and invitation to be
[48:09] ministering this morning. I pray
[48:11] something can be said to be a blessing.
[48:13] But if you would have your scriptures,
[48:15] let's open our Bibles to 1 Peter 1:1
[48:19] and we'll read that down to the second
[48:21] verse in Galatians 3 and28.
[48:24] It's good to have my traveling
[48:26] companions with me, Brother Aaron and
[48:28] Brother Devin. Uh, we have a me and my
[48:31] wife, we have a two-week old baby back
[48:33] home. And so she's not traveling with me
[48:36] at this time, but I got my nephew Aaron
[48:38] and a young man from our church, Brother
[48:40] Devon's traveling with me. And so
[48:43] they're they're definitely making the
[48:44] trip exciting. And so it's good to have
[48:47] them with me. And I do bring greetings
[48:49] from our home church, the saints there,
[48:51] New Life Outreach, and our pastor, Bill
[48:52] Wendle, sends their greetings as well.
[48:55] Amen. You love the Lord this morning.
[48:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. 1 Peter 1 and1 Peter an apostle of
[49:01] Jesus Christ to the strangers scattered
[49:04] throughout Punctus Galatia Capidosia
[49:08] Asia and Bethyleneia elect according to
[49:11] the fornowledge of God the father
[49:14] through the sanctification of the spirit
[49:16] unto obedience and sprinkling of the
[49:18] blood of Jesus Christ grace unto you and
[49:21] peace be multiplied in Galatians 3 and28
[49:26] and there is neither Jew nor Greek
[49:28] Greek, there is neither bond nor free.
[49:30] There is neither male nor female. For ye
[49:33] are all one in Christ Jesus. And if you
[49:36] be Christ, then you're Abraham's seed
[49:39] and heir according to the promise. Amen.
[49:42] Can we bow our heads this morning? Dear
[49:44] gracious heavenly father, Lord, how
[49:46] humbled we are by your presence that we
[49:48] feel this morning, Lord. God, we ask
[49:50] that you would just feel welcome here
[49:52] among us, Lord, and everything that is
[49:54] said and done, Father. Lord, you know
[49:56] the needs and the desires of your people
[49:58] that are gathered together here. Lord, I
[50:01] ask, Father, as I lay myself aside,
[50:03] Lord, may you anoint your servant.
[50:05] Father, as the word would come forth,
[50:07] Father, may there be a heart to receive
[50:09] it today, Lord. We ask that you would
[50:11] just be pleased in everything that is
[50:13] said and done. Lord, we commit the
[50:15] service into your hands in Jesus' name.
[50:18] Amen. You may be seated this morning and
[50:21] I just have a simple thought but it
[50:24] would be elected strangers and uh and
[50:28] Peter is addressing this to the
[50:29] strangers that is scattered throughout
[50:32] these places and whenever you will look
[50:34] up the word stranger it's always
[50:36] connected with the words pilgrim or
[50:39] souljourner and you can look the
[50:41] children of Israel was always likened
[50:43] unto pilgrims you can look at Leviticus
[50:46] 25 and 23 the land shall will not be
[50:49] sold forever, for the land is mine. For
[50:51] ye are strangers and sojourers with me.
[50:54] Even in the New Testament, Hebrews
[50:55] 11:13, these all died in faith, not
[50:58] having received the promises, but having
[51:01] seen them a far off and were persuaded
[51:03] of them and embraced them and confessed
[51:06] that they were strangers and pilgrims on
[51:08] the earth. And so, I believe that that
[51:11] so were we. I believe we are we've been
[51:13] called to not fit in with Leo. We're
[51:16] we're walking in it, but we're not a
[51:18] part of it. And I believe God has called
[51:20] us to be a pilgrim. And brother Brandon
[51:23] would say this here, a little something
[51:25] you might look at in the scripture.
[51:27] Those who sought this new city acted
[51:29] different. They professed that they were
[51:31] pilgrims and strangers, but on the side
[51:33] of Cain, they become fugitives and
[51:35] renegades. But Christians were pilgrims
[51:38] and strangers. A fugitive has no home. A
[51:41] renegade is a horrible person. But a
[51:44] pilgrim is something real from a real
[51:46] land in another nation trying to find
[51:49] his way home, professing by his living
[51:52] that he has something that is from
[51:54] another country. And I like how brother
[51:56] Brandham is describing that that a
[51:58] pilgrim has something from another land.
[52:01] He might not be in that land, but he's
[52:03] professing by his living or his actions
[52:06] that he has something from another land.
[52:09] And I believe that's the difference
[52:11] between serpent seed and the bride of
[52:13] Christ. Cuz brother Brandon would tell
[52:15] us and the Bible would tell us that that
[52:17] Cain would be called a renegade and a
[52:19] fugitive, which that would be the the
[52:21] line of the serpent seed. But we're not
[52:23] renegades and fugitives. We're pilgrims
[52:26] and we're strangers because we have
[52:28] something that has claimed our life. And
[52:30] and it's incredible because you can look
[52:32] at serpents. See, they they have no
[52:34] direction. They have no future. And they
[52:37] would like to think they have a future,
[52:39] but once they go by the way of the
[52:40] grave, what's their future then? But I
[52:43] believe that we have a faith walk like
[52:45] Abraham. You can talk to an unbeliever
[52:47] and if the stock market goes down,
[52:49] they're depressed. Or if a family member
[52:51] goes to by the way of the grave, now
[52:53] we're never going to see him again. But
[52:55] you see, I believe there's a certainty
[52:57] that the bride of Christ has that
[53:00] separates us from the serpent seed. And
[53:02] that's why I love Jeremiah 29 and 11 so
[53:05] much. For I know the thoughts that are
[53:08] think towards you, sayaeth the Lord,
[53:10] thoughts of peace and not of evil, to
[53:12] give you and expected in. So we have an
[53:15] expectation that we are striving for. We
[53:19] might not have much we can point to
[53:20] here, but we have a vision over our
[53:23] lives that we are striving to obtain. So
[53:27] there's an expectation that this word
[53:29] has given us in. We have a direction.
[53:31] You can look at 1 Thessalonians 4:17.
[53:34] For then with which we which are alive
[53:36] and remain shall be caught up together
[53:38] with him in the clouds to meet the Lord
[53:40] in the air, and so shall we be ever be
[53:43] with the Lord. Wherefore, comfort one
[53:45] another with these words. In other
[53:48] words, when this word comes, you can
[53:50] comfort yourself with it. Whenever the
[53:52] other that the the world might be
[53:54] falling apart, there's a certainty in
[53:57] the words of life that we can point back
[54:00] to. Even if I go by the way of the grave
[54:03] or if a family member goes by the way of
[54:05] the grave, there's a comfort in knowing
[54:08] our OUR FUTURE IS IN CONCRETE. And I
[54:11] believe that no matter what we go
[54:13] through, our future is still in
[54:16] concrete. AND THAT'S WHAT WE ARE
[54:18] STRIVING TO obtain is a future that God
[54:22] has given us. And I believe that once we
[54:24] know our future, it gives us an
[54:26] ambition. It gives us something that
[54:29] we're striving for. BECAUSE MANY times
[54:31] whenever you look at a you look at a
[54:33] pilgrim or somebody that that is st a
[54:36] souljourner, you think of somebody that
[54:38] has no direction. You think of somebody
[54:40] that is just roaming to and fro, you
[54:42] know, trying to find a place called
[54:44] home. But in reality, a souljourer
[54:47] normally has more of a direction than
[54:49] that of the locals. Cuz you can look at
[54:51] the children of Israel. They had a
[54:53] direction. But once they got into the
[54:55] promised land, what would they say? GIVE
[54:57] US A KING that we can fit in like the
[54:59] other ones. They were no longer
[55:01] sojourers, BUT NOW THEY WERE BECOMING
[55:03] COMFORTABLE. And too many times we
[55:05] become comfortable with where we are at
[55:08] and we lose our ambition. But I believe
[55:11] that this message has given us an
[55:13] ambition that our direction is clear and
[55:16] we cannot become lazy with it. You know,
[55:19] Brother Brandham would tell us that if
[55:21] you don't have a purpose, you're just
[55:23] going to float around. He would talk
[55:25] about the homeless man that would come
[55:27] and knock on his door and ask for
[55:28] something to eat. Y'all remember the
[55:30] story? And Brother Brandham would bring
[55:32] him in, give him a sandwich, and say,
[55:33] "Where you going?" The man would say,
[55:35] "Oh, nowhere." He says, "Well, WHERE'D
[55:37] YOU COME FROM?" "OH, NOWHERE." Brother
[55:39] Brandham says, "How long have you been
[55:40] doing this?" He said, "About about 20
[55:42] years." And wherever my I lay my hat is,
[55:45] that's where I caught home. Brother
[55:47] Brandham says he had no ambition. He had
[55:49] no NOTHING TO STRIVE TO STRIVE FOR. AND
[55:52] BROTHER BRANDHAM then would TELL US TOO
[55:54] MANY TIMES Christians get that way and
[55:57] we become driftwood. He says we're just
[55:59] we're we're just being pushed by this
[56:01] trash pile, pushed by that. He says
[56:03] we're going by the the stream of life
[56:06] and too many times we become driftwood.
[56:08] But then he says you can look at a boat
[56:10] that's coming down the same stream of
[56:12] life and it's something is powering it.
[56:15] He says, "WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE between
[56:17] driftwood and that boat? They're made
[56:19] out of the same kind OF MATERIAL, BUT
[56:21] THAT THAT THAT BOAT HAS A MOTOR BEHIND
[56:24] IT THAT IS PUSHING IT." AND YOU'RE IN
[56:26] FLESH JUST LIKE THE SERPENT SEAT IS. BUT
[56:29] WHAT IS PUSHING YOU AND GIVING YOU
[56:31] COMFORT IN THE TIME OF OF STRUGGLE,
[56:34] GIVING YOU A A DIRECTION IN THE TIME OF
[56:37] CONFUSION? YOU'VE GOT AN AMBITION BEHIND
[56:40] YOU THAT IS PUSHING YOU DOWN THE STREAM
[56:43] OF LIFE. EVEN WHEN YOU GET HUNG UP MAYBE
[56:45] BY SOME DRIFTWOOD, THERE'S A POWER
[56:47] BEHIND YOU THAT KEEPS PUSHING YOU ON.
[56:50] YOU MIGHT SLOW DOWN A LITTLE BIT, BUT
[56:52] THAT POWER IS STILL PUSHING ON. AND I
[56:55] BELIEVE THAT'S WHAT AN AMBITION IS. EVEN
[56:57] WHEN you get wore out, YOU GET TIRED,
[56:59] THAT AUTHORITY BEHIND YOU IS ALWAYS
[57:02] pushing you on. Hallelujah. And we can
[57:05] look how the natural always types the
[57:07] spiritual. So if A NATURAL PILGRIM HAS
[57:10] TO HAVE AN AMBITION, WHAT ABOUT A
[57:12] SPIRITUAL PILGRIM? And brother Brandham
[57:14] was saying, she said, "Well, then we're
[57:16] not Americans. What are we?" I said,
[57:18] "Our kingdom is is of above." You see,
[57:21] we are free. We're born again. The
[57:23] kingdom of God is within you. See, ACT
[57:26] LIKE UP THERE. You're delegates from
[57:29] there. I said, "We're citizens here,
[57:31] living here in flesh, but our spirits,
[57:34] WE ARE PILGRIMS AND STRANGERS. WE ARE
[57:37] FOREIGN to the world now, even our own
[57:39] nation. FOR WE HAVE ACCEPTED THE
[57:41] INVITATION WHEN IT KNOCKED out our heart
[57:44] TO BECOME A PART of him and his word and
[57:48] the word fixes us and makes us live and
[57:51] makes us ACT LIKE CHRISTIANS. I THINK
[57:53] THAT'S A POWERFUL THING THAT IN
[57:55] [screaming] FLESH WE'RE CITIZENS HERE
[57:57] BUT OUR SPIRIT MAN HAS ACCEPTED THE
[58:00] INVITATION WHEN THE WORD HAS KNOCKED
[58:02] UPON OUR HEARTS WHICH MAKES US A
[58:05] SOULJOURNER AND A PILGRIM. YOU SEE,
[58:07] THAT'S WHAT SEPARATES US FROM serpentry
[58:10] is they can confess with their lips, BUT
[58:12] THEIR HEART IS FAR FROM THEM. BUT THE
[58:15] BRIDE DON'T JUST HAVE A CONFESSION, BUT
[58:17] THEY HAVE ACTIONS BEHIND IT THAT I'M NOT
[58:20] JUST PROFESSING SOMETHING, BUT I'm
[58:21] acting at it. I'M ACTING OUT THE VISION
[58:24] THAT GOD HAS GIVEN US. And Jesus would
[58:27] say this here in Matthew 15:8, "This
[58:29] people draweth nigh unto me with their
[58:32] mouth and honorth me with their lips,
[58:34] BUT THEIR HEART is far from me. and in
[58:37] vain they do worship me, teaching for
[58:39] doctrines the commandments of men. And
[58:42] so accepting the invitation of the word
[58:45] is more than a sinner's prayer. IT'S
[58:47] OPENING UP EVERY AVENUE OF THE HEART AND
[58:49] SAYING THIS WORD IS MY ABSOLUTE. And
[58:52] it's incredible CUZ BROTHER BRANDON
[58:54] WOULD TELL US that and he would read
[58:57] Revelations 3 and we say behold I stand
[58:59] at the door and knock. If any man hear
[59:01] my voice and and open the door I will
[59:03] come in and suck with him. HE WOULD TELL
[59:05] US THAT'S THE CONDITION OF THE CHURCH.
[59:08] The church is on the out or Christ IS ON
[59:10] THE OUTSIDE OF THE CHURCH KNOCKING. AND
[59:12] IT'S INCREDIBLE BECAUSE HE'S giving an
[59:15] opportunity. BROTHER BRANDON WOULD TELL
[59:17] US THAT GOD don't send judgment without
[59:19] warning. SO HERE CHRIST IS KNOCKING ON
[59:22] THE DOOR, BUT THERE'S NO CLAIMING. IT'S
[59:24] A WHOSOEVER WILL. IF ANY MAN WILL HEAR
[59:28] MY VOICE, LET HIM OPEN the door. And so
[59:30] HERE HE'S GIVING A CHURCH THE CHURCH A
[59:33] CHANCE. BUT THEY'RE BEING CONDITIONED BY
[59:36] REFUSING THE INVITATION WHEN IT'S
[59:39] KNOCKING ON THEIR DOOR. OPEN UP THE
[59:41] BRIDE OF CHRIST. THE BRIDE IS BEING
[59:43] CONDITIONED BY ACCEPTING THE INVITATION
[59:46] WHEN A KNOCKS UPON THEIR HEART.
[59:48] HALLELUJAH. Brother Brandon WOULD TELL
[59:50] US CHURCH MEMBERS want a denominational
[59:52] filter so they can have their own desire
[59:55] AND STILL BE CLASSIFIED RELIGIOUS
[59:58] PEOPLE. SO THEY'RE CONFESSING HIM, BUT
[1:00:00] THEY WANT TO HAVE THEIR OWN DESIRE,
[1:00:02] THEIR THEIR OWN FILTER. BUT THE BRIDE OF
[1:00:04] CHRIST HAS ONE AMBITION THAT IS HEAVENS
[1:00:07] AND EARTH MAY PASS AWAY. BUT THIS WORD
[1:00:10] WILL NEVER FAIL. WHERE WOULD WE GO? FOR
[1:00:13] THOU HAST THE WORDS OF ETERNAL LIFE.
[1:00:15] THAT IS OUR AMBITION. THAT IS OUR
[1:00:18] FUTURE. THAT IS OUR DIRECTION. THAT IS
[1:00:20] WHAT WE ARE STRIVING FOR. AND IT'S
[1:00:23] INCREDIBLE BECAUSE BROTHER BRANDON WOULD
[1:00:24] TELL US IF you want to see the condition
[1:00:26] of the church, look at the women, right?
[1:00:29] He would say it's a a women's world and
[1:00:31] they have the rights. And and it's
[1:00:33] incredible how brother Brandon would see
[1:00:35] these things. He would SAY THAT THE
[1:00:37] FEMALES DON'T want to have a they don't
[1:00:39] want to have children no more. They want
[1:00:40] to have cats and they want to have dogs
[1:00:42] because if they have a child, it's going
[1:00:44] to deform their body, make their bodies
[1:00:46] ugly. They can't go to the clubs with a
[1:00:48] a NURSING BABY. IT'S INCREDIBLE CUZ
[1:00:51] RIGHT BEFORE THAT HE'S TALKING ABOUT THE
[1:00:53] church and he says the church is
[1:00:55] pregnantated with something. He says
[1:00:57] because they're BRINGING FORTH MEMBERS
[1:00:59] ALL OF THE TIME BUT THEY DON'T WANT
[1:01:01] THESE ACTS 238 BABBLING HOLLERING
[1:01:04] SCREAMING CHILDREN. BUT HE SAYS THAT'S
[1:01:06] THE ONLY KIND THAT THE CHURCH WILL
[1:01:09] PRODUCE. SO WHAT IS IT? THEY'RE BEING
[1:01:11] CONDITIONED BY SOMETHING BUT SO IS THE
[1:01:14] BRIDE. WHAT IS SHE BEING CONDITIONED
[1:01:16] FOR? IT'S TIME FOR TRANSLATION. IT'S
[1:01:19] TIME FOR A RAPTURE. AND THE ONLY WAY WE
[1:01:21] CAN STEP INTO THE RAPTURE IS TO BE
[1:01:24] CONDITIONED. AND HOW DO WE BECOME
[1:01:26] CONDITIONED? BY ACCEPTING THE WORD WHEN
[1:01:29] IT KNOCKS UPON THEIR HEART. BROTHER
[1:01:31] BRANDON would say this. He talks about
[1:01:33] the church how that she's a how she
[1:01:36] don't want these the uh the these tongue
[1:01:38] talkers in Acts 2:38 kind of children.
[1:01:41] BUT THEN HE SAYS THIS, NOTICE THIS
[1:01:42] CHARACTER. WHEN YOU SEE A WOMAN JUST GO
[1:01:45] ON THE RAMPAGE, JUST DO anything they
[1:01:47] want to do. WATCH THE CHURCH is doing
[1:01:50] the same thing. NOTICE, BUT WATCH WHEN
[1:01:52] THE SPIRITUAL BRIDE WHEN SHE BEGINS TO
[1:01:55] HAVE A REVIVAL. WHEN SHE BEGINS TO COME
[1:01:57] BACK AND LINE HERSELF UP WITH THE WORD,
[1:02:00] WATCH THEN. AND YOU'LL SEE HOW THE
[1:02:02] SCRIPTURE AT THIS TIME THERE'LL BE A
[1:02:04] MESSAGE SWEEP OUT TO CATCH THE BRIDE TO
[1:02:07] CATCH THAT WOMAN ELECT. AND SO THAT'S
[1:02:10] WHY WE'RE A STRANGER, BUT WE'RE AN
[1:02:12] ELECTED STRANGER. WE MIGHT NOT FIT IN
[1:02:15] WITH THE WORLD, BUT THERE'S AN ELECTED
[1:02:17] SEED ON THE INSIDE OF YOUR [screaming]
[1:02:19] HEART THAT WHEN THE WORD COMES ACROSS,
[1:02:21] YOU SAY YES AND AMEN. THAT IS WHERE I
[1:02:25] CAME FROM. I COME FROM GOD AND I'M GOING
[1:02:27] BACK TO GOD. IT'S A DEEP CALLING TO A
[1:02:30] DEEP. BUT THEN YOU CAN READ THERE IN
[1:02:32] JOHN 10:27. MY SHEEP HEAR MY VOICE AND I
[1:02:37] KNOW THEM AND THEY FOLLOW ME. IT'S
[1:02:39] INCREDIBLE BECAUSE THERE'S THREE THINGS
[1:02:41] IN THIS VERSE THAT REALLY STRIKES MY
[1:02:43] HEART. THIS AIN'T A WHOSOEVER WILL. MY
[1:02:45] SHEEP HEAR MY VOICE. IN OTHER WORDS,
[1:02:48] IT'S A CLAIMING. IT'S NOT A WHOSOEVER
[1:02:50] WILL, LET HIM COME. OR I'M KNOCKING ON
[1:02:53] THE DOOR. IF ANY MAN HEAR MY VOICE AND
[1:02:55] OPEN THE DOOR, I WILL COME IN AND S WITH
[1:02:57] HIM. THIS IS A CLAIMING. THERE'S MANY
[1:03:00] VOICES OUT THERE. THERE'S MANY
[1:03:02] ATTRACTIONS OUT THERE. BUT MY SHEEP IS
[1:03:04] GOING TO HEAR [screaming] MY VOICE.
[1:03:07] HALLELUJAH. HOW COME? BECAUSE HE SAYS
[1:03:10] AND I KNOW THEM. SO THE VERY REASON THE
[1:03:13] VOICE HAS COME IN THE FIRST PLACE
[1:03:15] BECAUSE THERE WAS A A SEED TO RECEIVE
[1:03:18] IT. SO THAT'S THE REASON HE CAN BE SO
[1:03:21] CONFIDENT MY VOICE OR MY SHEEP WILL HEAR
[1:03:23] MY VOICE IS BECAUSE I KNOW THEM AND I
[1:03:27] PREDESTINATED HIM TO RECEIVE THE WORD
[1:03:30] WHEN IT COMES ACROSS THEIR PATH.
[1:03:32] HALLELUJAH. THE CHURCH WORLD HAS KICKED
[1:03:34] ME OUT OF THE CHURCHES. KICKED ME out of
[1:03:36] the PULL PITS. KICK ME OUT OF THE HOMES,
[1:03:39] BUT MY SHEEP IS GOING TO HEAR MY VOICE.
[1:03:41] HALLELUJAH. BROTHER BRAND, I'M GOING TO
[1:03:43] SAY THIS HERE. THE BRIDE IS ELECTED of
[1:03:45] God. The church goes through, that's the
[1:03:48] ones that says, "WHOSOEVER WILL, LET HIM
[1:03:50] COME." BUT THE BRIDE IS THE ELECTED OF
[1:03:54] GOD. SO, YOU'RE NOT A WHOSOEVER WILL
[1:03:56] JUST HOPING THAT YOU'RE GOING TO RECEIVE
[1:03:58] THE HOLY GHOST. JUST HOPING THAT YOU'RE
[1:04:00] GOING TO RECEIVE THE WORD. BUT YOU ARE
[1:04:02] ELECTED of God. HALLELUJAH. JOHN JOHN
[1:04:06] 8:47. He that IS OF GOD HEARETH GOD'S
[1:04:09] WORDS. YE THEREFORE HEAR THEM NOT
[1:04:12] BECAUSE YE ARE NOT OF GOD. AND SO IT'S
[1:04:15] SIMPLE. YOU YOU REALLY CAN'T MISTAKE
[1:04:17] THEM FOR NOT FOR FOR FOR OUR FAULT THEM
[1:04:20] FOR NOT ACCEPTING THE truth because
[1:04:22] THERE'S NO TRUTH IN THEM. You know even
[1:04:25] Judas not excarat would say you how come
[1:04:27] you you showeth yourself to us and not
[1:04:30] to the world or manifest yourself unto
[1:04:32] us and not unto the world. And Jesus
[1:04:35] answers the question, if a MAN LOVED ME,
[1:04:37] HE'LL KEEP MY COMMANDMENTS. IN OTHER
[1:04:39] WORDS, IF THERE'S A DESIRE THERE, I'M
[1:04:41] GOING TO MANIFEST MYSELF TO HIM BECAUSE
[1:04:44] THERE'S AN ATTRACTION to me. The rest OF
[1:04:46] THE WORLD DON'T HAVE THAT ATTRACTION,
[1:04:48] BUT YOU ARE AN ELECTED SON AND DAUGHTER
[1:04:51] OF GOD. AND SO, BROTHER BRANDHAM would
[1:04:53] say, "See, Jesus said, "My sheep know my
[1:04:56] voice. They know my word. They see it
[1:04:58] when it's vindicated for that age." And
[1:05:01] brother Branowwood would would talk
[1:05:03] about the parable that Jesus would give
[1:05:06] on how that how that the the kingdom of
[1:05:08] heaven is like a fisherman with the net,
[1:05:10] right? He throws THEM OUT AND HE CATCHES
[1:05:13] MANY, but he's only after the sheep,
[1:05:15] right? OR ONLY AFTER THE FISH. BUT THE
[1:05:17] BRANDON WOULD SAY he would dramatize it
[1:05:19] and would say that he YOU CAN THROW OUT
[1:05:21] THAT NET AND IT CATCHES ALL KINDS. He
[1:05:24] says he catches the water spider, it
[1:05:26] catches the snake, it catches the fish,
[1:05:28] and he says the water spider stays in
[1:05:30] there for about a week. BUT BEN SAYS,
[1:05:32] "WELL, I have to give up my pants." And
[1:05:34] he says, "Blop, IT GOES BACK INTO THE
[1:05:37] WATER." THE SERPENT SAYS, "YEP, THIS IS
[1:05:39] GREAT. IT'S IN THERE FOR ABOUT a week."
[1:05:41] And then it says, "I have to give up my
[1:05:43] clubs." And he says, "RIGHT AWAY, IT
[1:05:44] GOES RIGHT BACK INTO THE WATER." HE
[1:05:46] SAYS, "THE NET had nothing TO DO WITH
[1:05:49] IT. The net didn't make that A WATER
[1:05:51] SPIDER. IT DIDN'T MAKE THAT A SERPENT.
[1:05:53] THE NET DIDN'T EVEN MAKE A FISH A FISH,
[1:05:56] BUT IT WAS THROWN OUT THERE. IT
[1:05:58] ATTRACTED MANY, BUT IT ONLY CLAIMED THE
[1:06:01] FISH. HALLELUJAH. AND THIS MESSAGE HAS
[1:06:04] ATTRACTED MANY, BUT IT HAS ONLY CLAIMED
[1:06:07] THE BRIDE OF JESUS CHRIST. THAT'S WHAT
[1:06:10] MY SHEEP WILL HEAR MY VOICE MEANS. IT'S
[1:06:13] A CLAIMING OVER YOUR [screaming] LIFE.
[1:06:15] YOU MIGHT HAVE MANY OTHER VOICES. YOU
[1:06:17] MIGHT HAVE MANY THINGS YOU'RE GOING
[1:06:19] THROUGH, BUT I'M GOING TO CLAIM YOU BY
[1:06:21] MY VOICE BECAUSE I KNOW YOU. HALLELUJAH.
[1:06:25] I PREDESTINATED YOU FROM BEFORE THE
[1:06:28] FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD, AND I'M GOING
[1:06:30] TO CLAIM YOU WITH MY MESSAGE.
[1:06:33] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. IT'S A CLAIM OVER OUR LIFE.
[1:06:36] BROTHER BRANDHAM must say, Lord, by your
[1:06:38] grace, your help, I CLAIM EVERY ONE OF
[1:06:40] THEM THAT hears this message. I claim
[1:06:43] them for God. I pray thee, Lord, both
[1:06:45] here this morning and those that were
[1:06:47] here on tape. And if there be a seed
[1:06:50] anywhere that's predestinated, Lord, to
[1:06:52] hear the word of this last day, MAY THEY
[1:06:55] COME IN NOW sweetly and humbly and lay
[1:06:59] the trophies down up the cross or the
[1:07:01] selves as a trophy of the grace of God
[1:07:04] that is CALLED THEM. AIN'T THAT
[1:07:06] POWERFUL? HE SAYS, "I CLAIM THEM." And
[1:07:08] and he says it in many different places.
[1:07:11] He would say, "Lord, I claim them for
[1:07:13] your glory." AND THEN HE WOULD STOP and
[1:07:15] would say, "Thim them that are here AND
[1:07:17] ALSO THEM THAT WILL HEAR THE TAPE." IN
[1:07:20] OTHER WORDS, THIS CALLING OR OR this
[1:07:22] claiming ain't just for those that were
[1:07:25] sitting IN THE MEETING, BUT IT'S FOR
[1:07:27] THOSE THAT WILL HEAR MY VOICE. I'M GOING
[1:07:29] TO CLAIM THEM. HE WOULD SAY IN ONE
[1:07:31] PLACE, I CLAIM THEM FOR YOUR PERSONAL
[1:07:33] TREASURE. HE SAYS, I CLAIM THEM IN ONE
[1:07:36] PLACE, THE TROPHIES OF YOUR WORD. In
[1:07:38] other words, he may have attracted MANY,
[1:07:41] BUT THEY'RE not trophies. Hallelujah.
[1:07:43] Remember the three pools? The first
[1:07:45] pull, IT ATTRACTED SOME. THE SECOND POOL
[1:07:47] ATTRACTED SOME, BUT THE THIRD PULL WAS
[1:07:50] ONLY FOR THE RAINBOW TROUT. IT WAS A
[1:07:52] CLAIMING. IT'S NOT FOR WHOSOEVER WILL.
[1:07:55] IT IS FOR THE VIRTUOUS BLOODB BRIDE OF
[1:07:59] JESUS CHRIST. HALLELUJAH. AND IT'S A
[1:08:01] CLAIMING that we become trophies of the
[1:08:05] inh trophies of the invitation that is
[1:08:07] knocked on our heart. Brother, I'm going
[1:08:09] to say this here. They've raised up
[1:08:10] their hands. They believe you. They
[1:08:12] believe on him that sent you. They're
[1:08:14] accepting the word and I claim them. And
[1:08:17] Satan cannot BE AROUND THEM NO MORE. I
[1:08:20] CLAIM THEM FOR THE GOSPEL. HALLELUJAH.
[1:08:24] AND SO, HOW DO YOU BECOME CLAIMED by the
[1:08:26] message? You see, it's more than just
[1:08:28] hearing it. But it's YOU RECEIVING IT.
[1:08:31] AS you receive it, there's an ANCHOR
[1:08:33] THAT COMES ON THE INSIDE OF THAT HEART
[1:08:35] THAT HAS GIVEN YOU AN AMBITION. THOUGH
[1:08:38] THE WORLD MAY TURN AWAY, the friends MAY
[1:08:40] TURN AGAINST ME, I AM FOLLOWING this
[1:08:43] claiming. And the third part of that
[1:08:45] that verse that that really spoke to my
[1:08:47] heart is MY SHEEP HEAR MY VOICE AND I
[1:08:50] know them and they follow me. In other
[1:08:52] words, once there's a claiming, there's
[1:08:54] a submission. Hallelujah. AND NOW THAT
[1:08:57] BECOMES YOUR ABSOLUTE BECAUSE YOU LOOK
[1:08:59] AT JOHN 10:5. AND A STRANGER WILL THEY
[1:09:02] NOT FOLLOW but will flee from him for
[1:09:05] they know not the voice of strangers. So
[1:09:08] once YOU ARE CLAIMED BY the voice of God
[1:09:10] which I believe IS THE MESSAGE OF THE
[1:09:12] HOUR. ANY OTHER VOICE IS A STRANGER. You
[1:09:16] see cuz if you're a stranger to the
[1:09:18] world then the world becomes a stranger
[1:09:20] to you. CUZ TOO MANY TIMES THE WORLD
[1:09:22] AIN'T A STRANGER TO YOU BECAUSE YOU'RE
[1:09:24] NOT A STRANGER TO THEM. YOU'RE TRYING TO
[1:09:26] FIT IN. YOU'RE TRYING TO DRESS LIKE
[1:09:28] THEM. YOU'RE TRYING TO TALK LIKE THEM.
[1:09:30] YOU'RE TRYING TO ACT LIKE THEM. AND NOW
[1:09:32] THE VOICES OF THE WORLD IS NO LONGER A
[1:09:34] STRANGER TO YOU. BUT ONCE YOU'RE CLAIMED
[1:09:37] BY ACCEPTING THIS MESSAGE, THEN THEY
[1:09:39] BECOME A STRANGER TO YOU. THAT WHEN THE
[1:09:41] VOICES COME TO YOU, YOU SAY, "NO, THAT'S
[1:09:44] NOT WHAT I'M CLAIMED BY. I'M NOT CLAIMED
[1:09:46] BY LEGACY. I'M NOT CLAIMED BY FORMALISM.
[1:09:49] I'M NOT CLAIMED BY LUKEWARMNESS. I'M
[1:09:51] CLAIMED BY THE VOICE OF ALMIGHTY GOD
[1:09:54] THAT HAS COME IN THIS GENERATION.
[1:09:57] HALLELUJAH. AND THAT IS WHAT OUR
[1:09:59] DIRECTION IS. You remember brother
[1:10:00] Brandham was in the Middle East and he
[1:10:02] he would be driving at a four-way stop I
[1:10:04] believe or riding and there would come a
[1:10:07] a herd of sheep that was coming through
[1:10:09] and there was a SHEPHERD THAT WAS
[1:10:10] GUIDING HIM. BUT BRANDON SAYS IT WAS
[1:10:12] INCREDIBLE BECAUSE ALL THE ALL OF THE
[1:10:14] CARS COME TO A STOP BECAUSE THESE SHEEP
[1:10:16] WERE COMING THROUGH THE ROAD and he
[1:10:18] looked and he seen a market, right? And
[1:10:20] he says the market ain't like our
[1:10:21] markets here. It's out on the pavement.
[1:10:23] And he says once those SHEEP BEGIN TO
[1:10:25] SEE ALL the produce, ALL OF THAT BREAD,
[1:10:28] they're going to go crazy. And he says
[1:10:29] as he was watching them, THEY WENT RIGHT
[1:10:32] THROUGH THAT MARKET. NEVER LOOKED TO THE
[1:10:34] LEFT or to the right. He says they were
[1:10:35] looking at ONE THING AND THAT WAS THE
[1:10:38] SHEPHERD. AND HE STOPPED AND HE SAYS, I
[1:10:39] WANTED TO PREACH A SERMON RIGHT THERE.
[1:10:41] WHAT IS IT? MY SHEEP WILL HEAR MY VOICE
[1:10:44] AND A STRANGER THEY WILL NOT FOLLOW.
[1:10:48] THAT'S WHY THIS BRIDE HAS A HAS A
[1:10:50] DIRECTION BECAUSE THEIR EYES IS ON ONE
[1:10:53] THING AND THAT IS THUS SAYAITH THE LORD.
[1:10:56] HALLELUJAH. That is thus sayaeth the
[1:10:59] Lord. BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT A WATER SPIDER
[1:11:01] AND AND I think this quote is pretty
[1:11:02] pretty powerful. Brother Brandon would
[1:11:04] say you see a scripture and you see it
[1:11:06] here and here and here and here and you
[1:11:09] ask your pastor about it and he says,
[1:11:11] "Oh, that's that that was for another
[1:11:12] day. If you're a child of God, you won't
[1:11:15] believe that." No, sir. When it said
[1:11:17] Jesus Christ, the same yesterday, today,
[1:11:19] and forever, the works that I do shall
[1:11:21] ye do also. See, what he was here, what
[1:11:24] he was there, he is here. And the pastor
[1:11:26] SAYS, "OH, THAT'S NONSENSE. THERE'S
[1:11:28] NOTHING TO THAT." HE SAYS, "YOU won't
[1:11:30] believe it BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT A SPIDER.
[1:11:33] You're not A SNAKE. YOU ARE A FISH."
[1:11:36] SEE, THERE IT IS. YOU'RE not a goat or a
[1:11:38] pig. You are a lamb. Hallelujah. Brother
[1:11:41] Brand, I'm going to say, "My sheep hear
[1:11:42] my voice." It's because it comes to the
[1:11:45] elected the ones WHO GOD HAD FORNAW
[1:11:49] FORNEW. And so you can look at at the
[1:11:52] power of predestination.
[1:11:54] And the reason that predestination is
[1:11:56] such a powerful FORCE IS BECAUSE YOU
[1:11:59] came from God. You can look at the
[1:12:00] prodical son. I'm sure the prodical son
[1:12:03] wasn't the only boy that was working in
[1:12:05] the pig slot, but he was the only ONE
[1:12:07] THAT CAME FROM THE FATHER. AND SO WHILE
[1:12:09] HE WAS GOING BACK TO THE FATHER, THE
[1:12:11] rest of them was staying in THE PIG
[1:12:12] SLOT. WHAT SEPARATED THE TWO? HE CAME
[1:12:15] FROM THE FATHER. HALLELUJAH. And what IS
[1:12:18] SEPARATING YOU FROM THE SERPENTINE IS
[1:12:21] YOU HAVE COME FROM the father. And
[1:12:23] brother Brandon would say, notice the
[1:12:25] word cannot deny itself. THEN IT IS
[1:12:27] SATISFIED. OR THE DESIRE. IT'S A DESIRE
[1:12:30] OF WHAT? WHAT MADE YOU DESIRE IT IN THE
[1:12:33] FIRST PLACE? BECAUSE DOWN IN YOUR SOUL
[1:12:36] THERE WAS A predestinated seed WHICH WAS
[1:12:39] ETERNAL LIFE ALWAYS laying in there
[1:12:41] always was in there. All that the father
[1:12:43] hath given me will come to me. There
[1:12:46] isn't any of them that's going to be
[1:12:47] lost. A thinking man's taste when a
[1:12:49] thinking man hears the word of God. MY
[1:12:52] SHEEP WILL HEAR MY VOICE AND THAT A
[1:12:54] STRANGER THEY WILL NOT FOLLOW. FOR DOWN
[1:12:56] IN THERE IS LIFE and life connects with
[1:12:59] life. Hallelujah. LIFE CONNECTS WITH
[1:13:02] LIFE. BROTHER BRANDHAM TALKS ABOUT THE
[1:13:04] EAGLE THAT COME ACROSS THE BARNYARD. He
[1:13:06] says it was eagle responding to eagle.
[1:13:09] IT WAS LIFE RESPONDING TO LIFE. And so
[1:13:12] that's what predestination is. I believe
[1:13:14] IT IS A CALLING. PREDESTINATION ain't a
[1:13:16] crutch, right? Well, you can do whatever
[1:13:18] you want and and still be safe. But
[1:13:20] predestination is an attraction. It g it
[1:13:24] gives a conviction that even if you are
[1:13:25] wrong, THERE'S A DESIRE THAT PULLS YOU
[1:13:28] BACK TO MY VOICE. AND SO AS YOU'RE
[1:13:30] RECEIVING the word, there's a separation
[1:13:33] that has taken place. And we can look at
[1:13:35] Moses and how in the book of Hebrews,
[1:13:37] the Bible tells us by faith Moses when
[1:13:40] he come two years refused to be called
[1:13:43] the son of Pharaoh's daughter. AND SO
[1:13:45] WHAT WOULD HAPPEN THAT WHENEVER HE
[1:13:47] become of age there he he decided to put
[1:13:50] away the ambition of Pharaoh and embrace
[1:13:54] another ambition. BUT WHAT WHAT WHAT
[1:13:56] BROUGHT THIS ON? HE had become matured.
[1:13:59] I love that. When he become of years,
[1:14:02] then he decided TO THROW AWAY THE
[1:14:04] IDENTITY of Pharaoh's daughter and
[1:14:07] become a stranger. And I believe that
[1:14:09] the bride has been maturing under this
[1:14:12] word and she has come to age. And so now
[1:14:15] there's a separation that has taken
[1:14:18] place. You remember the blind man that
[1:14:19] that Jesus would give A SIGHT BACK AND
[1:14:22] THEN and the Bible says the Jews would
[1:14:24] go to his parents and would say, "Is
[1:14:26] this your boy?" They say, "Yep, that is
[1:14:28] him." They said, "HOW DID HE RECEIVE HIS
[1:14:30] SIGHT?" AND WHAT WOULD THEY SAY? ASK
[1:14:32] HIM. HE'S OF AGE. In other words, he can
[1:14:35] speak for himself. He is a matured man.
[1:14:38] And he would SAY, "I WAS BLIND, BUT NOW
[1:14:40] I SEE." IN OTHER WORDS, THERE'S A
[1:14:42] CLAIMING THAT THAT MAN HAS ON MY LIFE
[1:14:45] THAT WOULD CHANGE ME. I WAS A BLIND MAN.
[1:14:47] I WAS A BEGGAR, BUT NOW HE HAS GIVEN
[1:14:50] BACK MY SIGHT. LET ME SPEAK FOR MYSELF.
[1:14:52] AND I BELIEVE THE BRIDE HAS COME OF AGE
[1:14:55] AND SHE CAN SPEAK FOR HERSELF. IT AIN'T
[1:14:57] SOME PREACHER THAT IS ALWAYS HAVING TO
[1:14:59] PRAY OVER YOU. BUT YOU CAN PRAY FOR
[1:15:01] YOURSELF. YOU CAN SPEAK OVER YOUR
[1:15:03] CHILDREN. YOU CAN SPEAK A BODY CHANGE
[1:15:05] OVER YOUR LIFE AND CLAIM IT WHY YOU HAVE
[1:15:08] COME OF AGE AND YOU CAN SPEAK FOR
[1:15:10] YOURSELF. HALLELUJAH. WHAT BROTHER SAY?
[1:15:13] THIS BRIDE WILL BE THE FINAL VOICE TO
[1:15:15] THE FINAL GENERATION UNDER HER
[1:15:17] MESSENGER. IN OTHER WORDS, SHE HAS COME
[1:15:19] OF AGE. THE VOICE OF THE GROOM IS IN THE
[1:15:22] BRIDE AND AS SHE IS SPEAKING THE SAME
[1:15:25] WORD THAT THE SON OF MAN HAS SPOKEN.
[1:15:28] HALLELUJAH. My she can speak for
[1:15:31] himself. And I believe that that the
[1:15:33] bride has also come in a union. Brother
[1:15:36] Brandham would say in there would be and
[1:15:38] in there there would be a time come
[1:15:40] forth when he could express himself in
[1:15:43] the fullness of his godhead deity
[1:15:46] through his church. have the preeminence
[1:15:48] in his church. Oh my. What? The anointed
[1:15:52] man. Now the ANOINTED PEOPLE. OH MY. TO
[1:15:55] BRING BACK THE ANOINTED BRIDE and the
[1:15:58] bridegroom. Anointed by what? ACCEPTING
[1:16:01] WHAT EVE TURNED DOWN. AND ADAM BACK
[1:16:03] THERE W WITH WITH THE WITH the anointing
[1:16:05] of the word. BECAUSE HE SAID, "MY WORD
[1:16:07] IS SPIRIT." SEE, and with the anointed
[1:16:10] is with the word. WHAT EVE TURNED DOWN,
[1:16:12] HE COMES BACK AND WE ACCEPT. SO WHAT IS
[1:16:16] IT BY YOU ACCEPTING the word? It's a
[1:16:18] maturity that is taking place that is
[1:16:21] placing you in your inheritance. That's
[1:16:24] why brother Brandma preach a bride age.
[1:16:26] We're walking IN LEGISA BUT WE'RE NOT
[1:16:29] CONDITIONED LIKE THE LEGISANS. WE'RE
[1:16:32] BEING CONDITIONED BY ANOTHER WORD.
[1:16:34] Brother Brand tell us we're living in
[1:16:36] the RAPTURING AGE. WHAT IS IT? IT'S
[1:16:38] SOMETHING THAT HAS separated us and has
[1:16:41] PLACED US IN OUR POSITION. AND IT'S
[1:16:43] INCREDIBLE because brother Brandon would
[1:16:45] talk about a king and how he would have
[1:16:47] a son and would say he was born he was
[1:16:50] born a son by birth but yet he did not
[1:16:53] fall heir to everything. And so in order
[1:16:55] for him to become heir of everything he
[1:16:58] HAD TO BE ADOPTED. SO EVEN THOUGH HE WAS
[1:17:00] A SON THERE HAD TO BE AN ADOPTION take
[1:17:03] place. And brother Brandon would say
[1:17:05] this here and THEN IF THE CHILD WAS
[1:17:07] OBEDIENT THEN THERE'S A SET CERTAIN DAY
[1:17:10] WHEN HE BECOMES of age. NOW THE
[1:17:12] PENTECOSTAL CHURCH OUGHT TO be of age 40
[1:17:16] years or BETTER ABOUT 50. SO IT should
[1:17:18] be of age. Then there comes a DAY WHEN
[1:17:20] THE SON BECOMES HE'S GOING TO be adopted
[1:17:23] or placed. He says you brethren what I'm
[1:17:25] trying to say placing of a son. You
[1:17:28] understand what I meant? He's to be
[1:17:30] placed positionally. He becomes an heir.
[1:17:32] Now they take him in the streets. They
[1:17:34] put him or I put on a certain garment.
[1:17:36] THEY HAVE A CEREMONY. AFTER THAT
[1:17:38] CEREMONY, THIS CHILD IS placed or
[1:17:41] adopted INTO THE SAME FAMILY HE WAS BORN
[1:17:44] IN. OH MY. SO YOUR BIRTH IS NOT YOUR
[1:17:47] ADOPTION, BUT BECAUSE YOU YOU WERE
[1:17:50] ALREADY BORN A SON OF GOD, YOU CAN BE
[1:17:52] ADOPTED AND BE HEIR OF all things. And
[1:17:54] then he says his name is just as good on
[1:17:57] a CHECK AS HIS DADDY IS. THAT'S RIGHT.
[1:18:00] HE falls heir. He's positionally placed.
[1:18:03] And I love brother Brandham PUTS THAT.
[1:18:05] THE PENTECOSTALS SHOULD BE of age, BUT
[1:18:08] THEY'RE NOT. BUT THEN HE WOULD TALK
[1:18:10] ABOUT HE WOULD GO THROUGH Luther Wesley
[1:18:12] and he says that how the Pentecost they
[1:18:14] would become deni they would THEY WOULD
[1:18:16] DENOMINATE BUT THEN HE WOULD CALL OUT
[1:18:18] HIS SONS OUT OF THAT AND WOULD PLACE
[1:18:21] HIM. WHAT IS IT? IT'S A CLAIMING OVER
[1:18:24] YOUR LIFE WHERE YOU MAY HAVE BEEN IN A
[1:18:27] DENOMINATIONAL SETTING. YOU MAY HAVE
[1:18:28] BEEN A PENTECOSTAL, BUT YOU WAS GOING
[1:18:31] AROUND IN A CYCLE. BUT THERE WOULD COME
[1:18:33] A CLAIM OVER YOUR LIFE AND SAY YOU WERE
[1:18:36] BORN FOR SUCH A TIME AS THIS. YOU WERE
[1:18:38] NOT BORN TO GO AROUND IN CONFUSION. YOU
[1:18:41] WERE BORN TO HAVE AUTHORITY OVER THE
[1:18:44] THINGS OF THIS WORLD. HALLELUJAH.
[1:18:45] [screaming]
[1:18:46] OVER THE DEPRESSION THAT COMES OVER YOUR
[1:18:48] LIFE, THE ANXIETIES THAT COMES OVER YOUR
[1:18:51] LIFE. YOU WERE BORN TO RULE. HALLELUJAH.
[1:18:54] AND YOUR NAME IS JUST AS GOOD AS THE
[1:18:57] FATHER'S NAME. HALLELUJAH.
[1:19:00] Your name is JUST AS GOOD AS THE
[1:19:02] FATHER'S NAME. BROTHER Brandham was
[1:19:04] would say in the beginning he was God
[1:19:06] alone. He says Genesis 2 he would say
[1:19:08] he's Jehovah. HE SAYS WHAT DID THAT
[1:19:10] MEAN? He isn't self-existent anymore.
[1:19:13] But now HE'S EXISTING WITH THE FAMILY.
[1:19:16] He says but in Genesis 2 when he made
[1:19:18] man he SAYS I AM YAHWEH. YAHWEH JEHOVAH.
[1:19:21] WHAT DID IT MEAN? I'm the all existence
[1:19:23] one who HAS CREATED SOMETHING OFF or
[1:19:26] myself TO BE A SON OF MINE OR a
[1:19:29] temporary or an amateur little one of
[1:19:32] mine. OH, GLORY. WHY? HE GAVE MAN.
[1:19:35] Jehovah means that he gave man to be an
[1:19:38] AMATEUR GOD BECAUSE HE IS FATHER GOD. He
[1:19:41] made man an amateur god. So he isn't
[1:19:43] self-existence anymore. HE EXISTS WITH A
[1:19:47] FAMILY. SO IT'S NO LONGER GOD ALONE OR
[1:19:50] GOD JUST WITH THE ANGELS. BUT NOW IT'S
[1:19:52] GOD IN A BODY WHERE IT WAS JUST ONE MAN.
[1:19:55] NOW IT IS ITS ANOINTED BODY. WHATEVER
[1:19:58] YOU LOOSE ON EARTH WILL BE LOOSED in
[1:20:00] heaven. You speak INTO THIS MOUNTAIN AND
[1:20:02] IT'LL DISAPPEAR. WHAT IS IT? THE VOICE
[1:20:05] OF THE GROOM IS IN THE BRIDE. BROTHER
[1:20:08] BROWN MUST SAY SHE HAS THUS SAYAITH THE
[1:20:10] LORD or she keeps still. Hallelujah.
[1:20:12] Brother Brham must say this. And notice
[1:20:14] what harmony Jesus never did anything
[1:20:16] until seeing of the father or the father
[1:20:19] showed him first. HARMONY BETWEEN GOD
[1:20:21] AND CHRIST. SEE, SO WILL THE BRIDE. HE
[1:20:23] SHOWS HER HIS WORD OF LIFE AND HE SHOWS
[1:20:26] HER AND SHE RECEIVES IT. THERE'S THE
[1:20:28] KEY. SHE RECEIVES IT. SHE NEVER DOUBTS
[1:20:31] IT. HALLELUJAH. IT COMES CONTRARY TO
[1:20:34] WHAT YOU THINK IS RIGHT. SHE NEVER
[1:20:36] DOUBTS IT. THEN HE SAYS, "NOTHING CAN
[1:20:38] HARM HER, NOT EVEN DEATH." HOW COME
[1:20:41] YOU'RE CLAIMED? YOU MIGHT GO BY THE WAY
[1:20:43] OF THE GRAVE, BUT DEATH HAS NO CLAIM ON
[1:20:45] YOU. THE GRAVE HAS NO CLAIM ON YOU. IT
[1:20:48] WAS LAZARUS THAT WAS IN A GRAVE THAT THE
[1:20:50] VOICE OF RESURRECTION WOULD SAY LAZARUS
[1:20:53] COME FORTH AND THAT VOICE WOULD CLAIM
[1:20:55] HIM AND WOULD BREAK THE CLAIMS THAT
[1:20:58] GRAVE WOULD HAVE OVER HIS LIFE.
[1:21:01] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:21:01] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. AND HE SAYS HERE IS THE
[1:21:04] SECRET. THE WORD IS IN THE BRIDE AND THE
[1:21:06] MIND OF CHRIST TO KNOW WHAT HE WANTS
[1:21:09] DONE WITH THE WORD AND SHE DOES IT IN
[1:21:12] HIS NAME. SHE HAS THUS SAITH THE LORD. I
[1:21:16] THINK THAT'S POWERFUL. SHE DON'T JUST
[1:21:18] HAVE THE WORD, BUT SHE KNOWS WHAT HE
[1:21:20] WANTS DONE WITH THE WORD. COME ON.
[1:21:22] REMEMBER BROTHER BRANDHAM TALKS ABOUT
[1:21:23] BENJAMIN FRANKLIN HOW THAT HE DISCOVERED
[1:21:26] electricity and WOULD SAY, "I GOT IT. I
[1:21:28] GOT IT. I GOT IT." HE SAYS HE KNEW HE
[1:21:31] HAD SOMETHING, BUT HE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT
[1:21:32] HE HAD. BUT THEN THOMAS ANDERSON WOULD
[1:21:35] COME ALONG AND WOULD CREATE THE LIGHT
[1:21:37] BULB. HE DIDN'T JUST HAVE SOMETHING, BUT
[1:21:39] HE KNEW HOW TO USE IT. AND MISS BRIDE
[1:21:41] JUST AIN'T SAYING, "WE HAVE A MESSAGE.
[1:21:43] WE HAVE A MESSAGE." BUT SHE KNOWS WHAT
[1:21:45] GOD WANTS DONE WITH HIM. WHAT IS THAT?
[1:21:48] WHAT DOES HE WANT DONE WITH HIM? HE
[1:21:50] WANTS A BRIDE UPON THE EARTH THAT IS
[1:21:52] BONE OF HIS BONE, FLESH OF HIS FLESH,
[1:21:55] LIFE OF HIS LIFE, POWER OF HIS POWER. HE
[1:21:58] WANTS A YOUNG PERSON THAT IS AN
[1:22:00] INVINCIBLE ARMY IN THE MIDST OF LEONA.
[1:22:03] HE WANTS MARRIAGES THAT CAN WEATHER THE
[1:22:06] STORM IN THE MIDST OF CONFUSION. THE
[1:22:09] BRIDE KNOWS WHAT HE WANTS DONE WITH the
[1:22:11] word.
[1:22:13] BUT HE DOES IT. BUT SHE DOES IT IN HIS
[1:22:15] NAME. So what is so SO SPECIAL ABOUT
[1:22:19] THAT NAME? Brother Brandham tell us that
[1:22:21] a name characterizes you. Right? He says
[1:22:24] if you have a son that is Ricky or
[1:22:26] Elvis, he says change the name. He says
[1:22:28] because that name CHARACTER RISES YOU.
[1:22:31] SO IN OTHER WORDS, THE NAME YOU'RE under
[1:22:33] is going to be YOUR CHARACTER OR YOUR
[1:22:36] LIFE. SO JACOB WOULD BE CHANGED TO
[1:22:38] ISRAEL, SIMON TO PETER, SAUL TO PAUL,
[1:22:41] and at the OPENING OF THE SEALS. BUT THE
[1:22:43] BRAND SAID, "I DON'T CALL YOU CHURCH,
[1:22:45] BUT I CALL YOU BRIDE." In other words,
[1:22:48] THERE'S GOING TO BE A LIFE THAT IS GOING
[1:22:50] TO COME INTO YOU WHERE YOU CAN PRODUCE
[1:22:53] THE GREATER WORKS. CUZ THE BIBLE WOULD
[1:22:55] TELL US IN THE BOOK OF ACTS that he's
[1:22:58] going to take a people out OF THE
[1:22:59] GENTILES FOR HIS NAME'S SAKE. AND I
[1:23:02] BELIEVE we're living IN THAT TIME WHERE
[1:23:05] HE HAS CALLED A PEOPLE OUT OF THE
[1:23:07] GENTILES AND HAS CALLED THEM TO BE A
[1:23:09] SOLDIER, BUT A SEPARATED PEOPLE FOR HIS
[1:23:12] NAME'S SAKE. AND if you look in the
[1:23:14] Strongs concordance, the definition of
[1:23:17] name is reputation, fame, or glory. In
[1:23:21] other words, WHEN YOU TAKE ON HIS NAME,
[1:23:24] you take on his reputation. HALLELUJAH.
[1:23:26] BECAUSE THE BIBLE SAYS WE'RE BORN
[1:23:28] SPEAKING LIES. WE'RE SHAPED IN INIQUITY,
[1:23:30] but our reputation IS DONE AWAY WHEN WE
[1:23:34] TAKE ON HIS NAME. HE TAKES ON OUR NAME
[1:23:36] AS A SINNER AND GIVES US HIS NAME AS
[1:23:39] MRS. JESUS CHRIST.
[1:23:42] &gt;&gt; Oh my. You know what I'm talking about.
[1:23:44] You can mention somebody's name and you
[1:23:46] SAY, "OH YEAH, THAT FELL." WHAT IS IT?
[1:23:48] THE REPUTATION, RIGHT? We we work in the
[1:23:50] construction trade back home. We're
[1:23:52] electricians. And you can mention
[1:23:54] somebody's name and their reputation
[1:23:56] comes to mind, right? Yeah. Somebody
[1:23:58] asked, "Hey, you know, uh, you know, a
[1:24:00] good plumber, you can mention a
[1:24:01] plumber." And they say, "Oh, I used him
[1:24:03] before." What is it? THE REPUTATION. AND
[1:24:05] SO, OUR REPUTATION WAS A NEGATIVE
[1:24:08] REPUTATION. BUT WHEN CHRIST WOULD CLAIM
[1:24:10] US BY accepting his word, IT DOES AWAY
[1:24:14] WITH OUR REPUTATION AND IT GIVES US HIS
[1:24:17] REPUTATION. OH MY. REMEMBER ZAKIUS?
[1:24:19] ZAKIUS, THE BIBLE says he we he desired
[1:24:22] to see JESUS WHO HE WAS. HE DIDN'T
[1:24:25] WANTED TO SEE THE BODY. HE WANTED TO SEE
[1:24:27] THE REPUTATION.
[1:24:29] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. AND THE BODY WOULD LEAVE
[1:24:31] ZAKIUS'S HOUSE, BUT THAT REPUTATION
[1:24:34] WOULD STAY THERE. THE BIBLE SAYS THAT
[1:24:36] ZAKIUS WOULD GO TO ALL THE ONES HE DONE
[1:24:39] WRONG AND WOULD MAKE HIS DEATHS RIGHT.
[1:24:41] WHAT WAS IT? THE BODY LEFT, BUT THE
[1:24:44] GLORY OF THE LORD WOULD REMAIN. WE MIGHT
[1:24:47] NOT HAVE THE CORPORAL BODY OF JESUS
[1:24:49] CHRIST, BUT THE GLORY OF THE LORD HAS
[1:24:52] RISEN UPON THEE AND SHALL BE SEEN IN
[1:24:55] THEE. ARISE AND SHINE. HALLELUJAH.
[1:24:57] [screaming] WE'RE NOT KNOWN AS A CHURCH.
[1:25:00] We've been claimed TO BE THE BRIDE OF
[1:25:02] JESUS CHRIST. AND THE GLORY OF THE LORD
[1:25:05] IS BEING SHOWN through us. HALLELUJAH.
[1:25:08] IT'S BEING SHOWN THROUGH US. YOU CAN
[1:25:11] LOOK AT MOSES. MOSES wanted to see God's
[1:25:13] glory in Exodus 33:18. And he said, I
[1:25:17] BESEECH THEE, SHOW ME THY GLORY. AND HE
[1:25:19] SAID, "I WILL MAKE ALL MY GOODNESS PASS
[1:25:21] BEFORE THEE, AND I WILL PROCLAIM THE
[1:25:24] NAME OF the Lord before thee, and will
[1:25:26] be GRACIOUS TO WHOM I WILL BE GRACIOUS,
[1:25:29] and will SHOW MERCY ON WHOM I WILL SHOW
[1:25:32] MERCY." WHAT'S HE SAYING HERE? But the
[1:25:35] proclaiming of my name, YOU'RE GOING TO
[1:25:37] SEE A DIFFERENT SIDE OF ME. THEY SEEN
[1:25:40] GOD MIGHTY AND BOUND. GOD GOD WAS A
[1:25:42] JUDGMENTAL GOD, BUT NOW HE WAS GOING TO
[1:25:44] SHOW HIMSELF through grace AND MERCY.
[1:25:48] AND HOW ARE THEY GOING TO SEE THIS OTHER
[1:25:50] SIDE OF GOD? BY THE PROCLAIMING OF HIS
[1:25:53] NAME. HALLELUJAH. WHAT'S INCREDIBLE IS
[1:25:56] HE MAKES A CLAIM. I WILL BE I WILL MAKE
[1:25:58] ALL MY GOODNESS PASS BEFORE THEE AND I
[1:26:01] WILL proclaim the name of the Lord
[1:26:02] before thee and will be gracious TO WHOM
[1:26:05] I WILL BE GRACIOUS. IN OTHER WORDS, it
[1:26:08] ain't for everybody, but it's only to
[1:26:10] the elected.
[1:26:12] And you can look up THE GRACE OF GOD
[1:26:14] WHENEVER IT WAS TIME FOR THE DEATH ANGEL
[1:26:17] TO COME THROUGH THE LAND OF EGYPT. IT'S
[1:26:19] INCREDIBLE BECAUSE THE BIBLE WOULD TELL
[1:26:21] US THAT THEY had to get hissip, right?
[1:26:24] Dip it in the blood of the lamb and they
[1:26:26] would put it over THE DOORPOST AND THAT
[1:26:28] WAS GOD'S MERCY TO THE CHILDREN of
[1:26:30] Israel. But brother Brandon would tell
[1:26:32] us that HISSUP WAS JUST A COMMON WEED IN
[1:26:36] PALESTINE. AND I THOUGHT, "OH MY, COULD
[1:26:38] YOU IMAGINE BEING PHARAOH WHENEVER THE
[1:26:40] DEATH ANGEL'S coming through your land?
[1:26:42] YOUR FIRSTBORN JUST DIED AND ANY KING
[1:26:45] WOULD BE LIKE, MAN, HOW DO I STOP THIS
[1:26:47] FROM GOING THROUGH MY KINGDOM?" I'm sure
[1:26:49] they MAY HAVE BEEN THINKING ABOUT IT,
[1:26:51] TALKING ABOUT IT, BUT LITTLE DID THEY
[1:26:53] KNOW THERE WAS A COMMON WEED SITTING IN
[1:26:57] THE MIDST OF THE KINGDOM THAT COULD
[1:26:59] BRING A GRACE. BUT HOW COME THEY
[1:27:02] COULDN'T SEE IT? THEY WASN'T TOLD ABOUT
[1:27:04] IT. BUT THE GRACE OF GOD WOULD COME TO
[1:27:07] THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL AND SAY IT'S
[1:27:09] SOMETHING SIMPLE BUT TAKE THAT
[1:27:11] SIMPLICITY AND IT WILL BE MY GRACE TO
[1:27:14] YOU. AND BROTHER BRAND TELL US THAT THE
[1:27:16] THAT THE HISHUP WAS A TYPE OF FAITH. AND
[1:27:19] HERE THE WORLD IS LOSING THEIR MIND.
[1:27:22] THEY'RE GOING INSANE. THEY'RE TRYING TO
[1:27:23] FIND SOMETHING THAT CAN BRING A PEACE IN
[1:27:26] THE MIDST OF THEIR INSANITY. BUT YET THE
[1:27:29] BRIDE OF CHRIST HAS A SIMPLE FAITH THAT
[1:27:32] HAS BROUGHT THE GRACE OF GOD. WHY? BY
[1:27:34] THE PROCLAIMING OF HIS NAME, I WILL BE
[1:27:37] GRACIOUS TO WHOM I WILL BE GRACIOUS. I
[1:27:40] WILL SHOW MERCY TO WHOM I WILL SHOW
[1:27:42] MERCY. IT'S A CLAIMING OVER YOUR LIFE.
[1:27:46] HALLELUJAH. THE DEATH ANGEL MIGHT COME
[1:27:48] TO YOUR HOME, BUT YOU'RE CLAIMED BY
[1:27:50] ANOTHER. IT MIGHT COME TO YOUR CHILDREN,
[1:27:53] BUT IT'S CLAIMED BY ANOTHER. IT MAY COME
[1:27:55] TO THIS CHURCH, BUT IT'S ALREADY CLAIMED
[1:27:58] BY ANOTHER.
[1:28:01] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. We're elected strangers.
[1:28:05] WE'RE ELECTED FOR THIS. YOU'RE CALLED
[1:28:07] FOR THIS. YOU'RE PREDESTINATED for this.
[1:28:10] Hallelujah. So God wasn't just a God of
[1:28:13] judgment, but he was a God of mercy. But
[1:28:16] it was at the proclaiming of his name.
[1:28:19] AND BROTHER BRANDHAM WOULD TELL us that
[1:28:21] through the Old Testament, God had many
[1:28:23] titles. Jehovah Gyra. He would say rose,
[1:28:27] rose of Sharon, lily of THE VALLEY, THE
[1:28:29] BRIGHT AND MORNING STAR. But he says,
[1:28:32] but when Christ came, he wasn't a title.
[1:28:35] But Jesus says, I come in MY FATHER'S
[1:28:38] NAME. SO IN other words, WHEN CHRIST
[1:28:40] CAME, IT WASN'T JUST A TYPE. IT WAS A
[1:28:43] FULFILLMENT OF EVERYTHING THAT THE OLD
[1:28:46] TESTAMENT TALKED ABOUT. I AM MERCY. I AM
[1:28:49] GRACE THAT IS COMING TO TAKE AWAY THE
[1:28:52] SIN OF the world. NOT JUST A SUBSTITUTE,
[1:28:55] BUT I COME TO CLAIM YOU. WELL, THE SIN
[1:28:58] NATURE, the blood of BULLS AND GOATS
[1:29:01] WOULD COVER THEIR SIN, BUT THEY WERE
[1:29:03] STILL CLAIMED BY IT. BUT THE BLOOD OF
[1:29:05] CHRIST WOULDN'T JUST COVER IT, but it
[1:29:07] would bring a remission, [laughter]
[1:29:09] WHICH IS A SEPARATION. In other words,
[1:29:11] THE SIN THAT WOULD ONCE CLAIM US WERE
[1:29:14] NOW CLAIMED BY THE BAPTISM OF THE HOLY
[1:29:17] GHOST. And so, at the expression OF THE
[1:29:20] NAME OF GOD WOULD COME THE GRACE OF GOD.
[1:29:23] AMEN.
[1:29:24] &gt;&gt; AND BROTHER BROWN, I'M GOING TO TELL US,
[1:29:25] AND THE NAME IS IN the word because he
[1:29:28] IS THE WORD. AMEN. WHAT IS HE THEN? The
[1:29:31] word INTERPRETED IS THE MANIFESTATION OF
[1:29:35] THE NAME OF GOD. HALLELUJAH. SO WHERE IS
[1:29:39] HIS NAME? HOW DO YOU BECOME A PART OF
[1:29:42] HIS NAME? WHEN THE WORD IS INTERPRETED
[1:29:45] AND YOU ACCEPT IT, THEN YOU ARE CLAIMED
[1:29:48] BY THE NAME OF GOD. HALLELUJAH. Brother
[1:29:51] Brown tell us that that any son comes in
[1:29:54] his father's name. He says Jesus said I
[1:29:57] COME IN MY FATHER'S NAME. AND HE SAYS SO
[1:29:59] WILL THE BRIDE COME IN THE FATHER'S
[1:30:02] NAME. IT IS MISS JESUS CHRIST. AND
[1:30:04] WHAT'S INCREDIBLE? He would TELL US THAT
[1:30:06] THIS OPEN BOOK is your marriage
[1:30:08] certificate. HALLELUJAH. WELL, WHAT IS
[1:30:11] THE PROOF THAT THE BRIDE AND THE
[1:30:13] BRIDEGROOM HAS HAS UNITED THIS MESSAGE?
[1:30:16] YOU CAN SAY AMEN TO EVERY WORD AND IT'S
[1:30:19] YOUR MARRIAGE CERTIFICATE TO THE DEVIL
[1:30:22] THAT HE CAN DO WHAT HE WANTS, BUT I'M
[1:30:24] ALREADY CLAIMED BY ANOTHER.
[1:30:27] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. And so we've come in the
[1:30:30] father's reputation or the father's
[1:30:33] glory. AND SO WE CAN LOOK AT ABRAHAM
[1:30:35] THAT WHEN WHEN Abraham's name would be
[1:30:38] changed, it wasn't changed TO MAKE IT
[1:30:40] SOUND BETTER. IT WAS it was changed to
[1:30:43] change his reputation, right? HE HE HE
[1:30:45] WAS FATHERLESS. BUT BROTHER BRANDHAM
[1:30:47] WOULD TELL US THAT ABRAM AND Elohim
[1:30:49] would come together, right? And so his
[1:30:51] name would be Abraham, IT WAS GOD'S
[1:30:54] REPUTATION COMING TO A FALLEN HUMAN
[1:30:57] BEING THAT HAD A NEGATIVE REPUTATION
[1:30:59] THAT COULDN'T THAT COULD NOT BRING FORTH
[1:31:02] THE PROMISED CHILD. BUT WHEN THE
[1:31:04] REPUTATION OF GOD WOULD COME TO
[1:31:06] HUMANITY, THEN IT COULD PRODUCE THE
[1:31:09] PROMISE FOR THAT DAY. AND BROTHER
[1:31:12] BRANDHAM WOULD TELL US THAT ABRAHAM is a
[1:31:14] type of the church. He would say, "Do
[1:31:16] you love the journey with Abraham?" I
[1:31:18] JUST LOVE TO WATCH IT BECAUSE WHY?
[1:31:20] EVERYTHING THAT HE DID WAS A PERFECT
[1:31:23] TYPE OF THE CHURCH. So we can look at
[1:31:26] the life of Abraham. AND IT'S INCREDIBLE
[1:31:28] BECAUSE IT WASN'T ABRAHAM looking for
[1:31:31] God. It was God looking for Abraham. And
[1:31:33] he would come and and brother Brandon
[1:31:35] would tell us that that ABRAHAM WAS
[1:31:37] CALLED BY GRACE. It wasn't Abraham had
[1:31:40] something to OFFER OR HE HAD HE had
[1:31:43] prestige but it was only he was only
[1:31:45] called by grace. AND IT'S INCREDIBLE
[1:31:48] BECAUSE BROTHER BRANDON WOULD tell us
[1:31:49] that Abraham or Abram WAS FROM THE CITY
[1:31:52] OF BABYLON. HE LIVED IN A CITY THAT THAT
[1:31:55] WAS IN THE PROVINCE. AND IT'S POWERFUL
[1:31:57] BECAUSE BROTHER BRANDHAM WOULD TELL US
[1:31:59] that if there's any type of of re of
[1:32:01] denominationalism IN THE BIBLE, IT'S
[1:32:03] BABYLON, RIGHT? HE WOULD SAY IT'S A
[1:32:05] FOREST RELIGION. HE SAYS EVERYBODY HAD
[1:32:08] TO COME TO THE TOWER OF BABEL TO
[1:32:11] WORSHIP. AND I THOUGHT HERE WAS ABRAM IN
[1:32:14] A FORCED RELIGION BUT YET GRACE WOULD
[1:32:17] COME BY HIS WAY. HALLELUJAH. BUT THE
[1:32:20] BRAND TELL US THAT DENOMINATIONALISM is
[1:32:22] a forced RELIGION BUT THE BRIDE OR THE
[1:32:26] THE BRIDE COMES INTO CHRIST NOT BY
[1:32:28] FORCED RELIGION BUT BY ELECTION. SO HERE
[1:32:31] ABRAM WAS A PART OF A FORCED RELIGION
[1:32:34] AND THEN ELECTION THEN GRACE WOULD COME
[1:32:37] BY HIS WAY. WHAT WAS IT? IT WAS LIFE
[1:32:40] CONNECTING TO LIFE. HALLELUJAH. AND you
[1:32:43] may have been IN A FORCED RELIGION BUT
[1:32:46] GRACE WOULD COME BY YOUR WAY AND SAY
[1:32:49] SEPARATE YOURSELF BEING NOT A PARTAKER
[1:32:52] OF HER SINS AND OF HER PLAGUES.
[1:32:55] HALLELUJAH. LIFE CONNECTS TO LIFE.
[1:32:58] BROTHER BRANDHAM, I THINK IT'S A
[1:32:59] POWERFUL THING BECAUSE BROTHER BRANDON
[1:33:01] TELLS us that that Abram was a par as a
[1:33:04] type of the church. So you you and that
[1:33:07] gave me a different perspective of the
[1:33:09] life of Abraham cuz you you hear the
[1:33:11] stories of Abraham, how their bodies
[1:33:14] were changed, the name was changed, EL
[1:33:16] SHADI. BUT THEN BROTHER BROWN WOULD
[1:33:18] WOULD BRING IT down to us and he would
[1:33:20] tell us that there's four stages of
[1:33:22] Abraham's journey. He would tell US IN
[1:33:24] GENESIS 12, GOD IS CALLING ABRAHAM. And
[1:33:27] he would say that's justification,
[1:33:29] Luther. Genesis 15, God's confirming the
[1:33:32] covenant with Abraham, right? Which is
[1:33:34] when he got the different ANIMALS AND
[1:33:36] AND GOD would come and walk through the
[1:33:38] midst of it. He says that there was
[1:33:40] sanctification WESLEY. AND THEN HE SAYS
[1:33:43] GENESIS 17:1 IS EL SHADI, THE
[1:33:46] STRENGTHGIVER. And he says THAT'S A TYPE
[1:33:48] OF THE HOLY GHOST, WHICH IS PENTECOST.
[1:33:51] BUT HE DIDN'T STOP THERE. BUT THEN HE
[1:33:53] SAYS GENESIS 17 and5 Abraham's name
[1:33:56] change AND HE SAYS THAT WAS HIS
[1:33:58] ADOPTION. HALLELUJAH. SO ONCE WE SEE
[1:34:02] OURSEL THAT ABRAHAM WAS A SOULJOURER BUT
[1:34:05] GOD WAS WORKING by election every STEP
[1:34:09] OF THE JOURNEY SO IS HE WITH US. WE
[1:34:12] MIGHT BE A SOULJOURER BUT GOD HAS BEEN
[1:34:14] WORKING WITH US THROUGH ALL OF THESE
[1:34:16] CHURCH AGES. AND HE'S COME TO THE CLIMAX
[1:34:19] AND SAYS, "I'M NOT JUST GOING TO BE A
[1:34:21] SHOUT OUT TO YOU. I'M NOT JUST GOING TO
[1:34:23] SANCTIFY YOU OR JUSTIFY YOU, BUT I'M
[1:34:26] GOING TO COME AND PLACE MY NAME AND
[1:34:29] BRING YOU AS AN ADOPTED SON AND DAUGHTER
[1:34:32] OF GOD." THAT YOUR NAME IS AS GOOD AS MY
[1:34:35] NAME. YOU PUT WHATEVER YOU HAVE NEED OF
[1:34:38] ON THAT CHECK AND IT WILL CASH.
[1:34:40] [screaming] HALLELUJAH. I SAY THIS
[1:34:42] MORNING, WHATEVER YOU HAVE NEED OF, YOUR
[1:34:45] NAME IS AS GOOD AS GOD'S NAME. SPEAK THE
[1:34:47] WORD OVER YOUR SITUATION. SPEAK THE WORD
[1:34:50] OVER YOUR CHILDREN. SPEAK THE WORD OVER
[1:34:53] YOUR MARRIAGE. YOUR NAME IS AS GOOD AS
[1:34:55] GOD'S NAME.
[1:34:56] &gt;&gt; YOUR REPUTATION IS AS GOOD AS GOD'S
[1:34:59] REPUTATION.
[1:35:00] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:35:01] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. Brother Brandham says God
[1:35:04] took Abraham out and placed the adoption
[1:35:06] upon him and changed his name. He says
[1:35:10] from Abram to Abraham. Abraham comes
[1:35:13] from the word Elohim. God's own name. He
[1:35:16] associated HIS NAME WITH GOD'S NAME. GOD
[1:35:18] IS ELOHIM. How many knows THAT THE GREAT
[1:35:20] JEHOVAH ELOHIM, THE ALLSUFFICIENT ONE,
[1:35:23] the selfexistent one, Elohim, THAT
[1:35:27] ALMIGHTY GOD WOULD COME AND GIVE HIS
[1:35:29] reputation to a fallen human being. Then
[1:35:32] brother Brown tell us so does God do
[1:35:34] with the royalty of Abraham. He would
[1:35:37] say, "Well, whatever we do in word and
[1:35:40] deed, we do it all in the name of Jesus
[1:35:42] Christ." He says, "THAT'S RIGHT. THERE
[1:35:44] YOU ARE." associated a name after THE
[1:35:48] ADOPTION. HE SAYS IT AGAIN AFTER the
[1:35:51] adoption. AND SO THAT'S A POWERFUL thing
[1:35:54] because brother Brandham before that
[1:35:56] quote and a lot of this is in Abraham's
[1:35:58] grace covenant. He would say that that
[1:36:01] whatever you do in word or in deed do it
[1:36:03] all in the name. and he stops and he
[1:36:05] says, "Well, can you smoke in that
[1:36:07] name?" He says, "Can you wear those
[1:36:08] pants in that name?" He's trying to get
[1:36:11] the the Pentecostal PEOPLE, THEY'RE
[1:36:13] CLAIMING THEY'VE ARRIVED, BUT HE SAYS,
[1:36:15] "BUT NOT REALLY. YOU'RE NOT CLAIMED YET.
[1:36:18] YOU'RE CLAIMING YOU'RE CLAIMED BY
[1:36:19] ANOTHER. CAN YOU WEAR PANTS in his name?
[1:36:22] Can you do those cards in his name?" BUT
[1:36:24] THE BRIDE SAYS, "I CAN. [laughter]
[1:36:26] WHATEVER YOUR WORD SAYS, I SAY AMEN TO
[1:36:29] IT. AND WHATEVER WE DO IN word or in
[1:36:32] deed, we do it all in the name of Jesus
[1:36:35] Christ. Brother Barnamus said he's he
[1:36:38] began to place his son Martin Luther
[1:36:40] restification. Years and years and years
[1:36:42] came sanctification. Years and years and
[1:36:44] years come the baptism of the Holy
[1:36:46] Ghost. But right quick after Pentecost
[1:36:49] did the same thing. The rest of them
[1:36:51] did. He be to PULL OUT HIS SONS THAT
[1:36:54] stood for his truth and HE GAVE THEM
[1:36:56] SOMETHING SPECIAL. MAGNIFIED HIM BEFORE
[1:36:59] the people with a certain thing that he
[1:37:02] stood out. See, placed him. I think THAT
[1:37:05] IS SO POWERFUL. HE MAGNIFIED HIM BEFORE
[1:37:08] THE PEOPLE. THAT'S WHY I KNOW BACK HOME,
[1:37:11] you know, there's been the the the town
[1:37:13] people ASK, "DAD, HOW DO YOU MAKE your
[1:37:15] your people wear skirts? Do you make
[1:37:17] them?" He says, "No, THEY WANT TO.
[1:37:19] THEY'RE MAGNIFIED." WHAT IS IT? THEY'RE
[1:37:21] CLAIMED BY ANOTHER. THEY MIGHT BE
[1:37:23] SOLDERS, but they're claimed by
[1:37:25] something else. And you see, my sheep
[1:37:27] will hear my voice. AND AND I BELIEVE
[1:37:30] THAT that we know what to do with the
[1:37:32] word. WE WE KNOW WHAT GOD WANTS done
[1:37:34] with it. You remember when Moses WAS
[1:37:36] CRYING WHEN HE came to the Red Sea, WHAT
[1:37:39] WOULD GOD SAY? WHY CRYING TO ME? SPEAK.
[1:37:41] IN OTHER WORDS, YOU'VE GOT THE
[1:37:42] AUTHORITY. WHY ARE YOU CRYING ABOUT IT?
[1:37:45] SPEAK AND GO FORWARD. REMEMBER, BROTHER
[1:37:48] BRANDON WOULD SAY, PEOPLE IS CRYING ALL
[1:37:50] THE TIME. WHAT TO DO? WHAT TO DO NEXT?
[1:37:52] WHAT'S NEXT? HE SAYS JUST SPEAK AND GO
[1:37:55] FORWARD. HE SAYS, "IF GOD'S COMMISSIONED
[1:37:57] to you to do it," HE SAYS, "SPEAK AND GO
[1:37:59] FORWARD." AND THEN HE STOPS AND HE SAYS,
[1:38:02] "HE IS STILL THE GOD OF MIRACLES." AND I
[1:38:05] JUST LOVE THAT QUOTE. HE IS STILL THE
[1:38:08] GOD OF MIRACLES. IN OTHER WORDS, QUIT
[1:38:10] CRYING ABOUT YOUR situation and use the
[1:38:13] word and speak the word. HE IS STILL THE
[1:38:16] GOD OF MIRACLES.
[1:38:18] &gt;&gt; You shall prophesy again. Right? You're
[1:38:21] taking the word and the word is upon
[1:38:23] your lips. Hallelujah. And you can look
[1:38:26] at why Peter and John, you know, silver
[1:38:28] and gold have I none, but what SUCH AS I
[1:38:31] HAVE, I GIVE UNTO THEE. RISE UP AND walk
[1:38:33] in the name of Jesus. And the people
[1:38:35] took notice. I love it. They took NOTICE
[1:38:38] THAT THEY WERE MAGNIFIED. THEY TOOK
[1:38:40] NOTICE that these were ignorant men,
[1:38:42] unlearned men. BUT THERE'S SOMETHING
[1:38:44] DIFFERENT. THIS AIN'T THEIR reputation
[1:38:46] that done that. COME ON NOW. THIS AIN'T
[1:38:48] THEIR REPUTATION. THEY TOOK NOTICE. THEY
[1:38:51] HAD BEEN WITH JESUS. HALLELUJAH. THEY
[1:38:54] HAD BEEN MAGNIFIED. NOW THE LIFE OF
[1:38:56] CHRIST WAS WORKING THROUGH THEM. And I
[1:38:59] think so is it today in my name you
[1:39:01] shall CAST OUT DEVILS. WHY? WE'RE
[1:39:03] connected to the source. And brother
[1:39:06] Brown tell us many CHURCHES IS TRYING TO
[1:39:08] TAKE the name. He says they're just
[1:39:10] taking the name Christian church and
[1:39:12] pretending to be the bride. AND HE SAYS
[1:39:14] THEY'RE ARTIFICIALLY the bride. HE SAYS
[1:39:17] THEY'RE NOT CONNECTED to the life's
[1:39:19] source in any way. But he SAYS THE BRIDE
[1:39:22] HAS taken on his name. AND THEN HE WOULD
[1:39:24] STOP AND WOULD SAY, "WELL, HIS NAME, BUT
[1:39:27] I MEAN NATURE. HE'S TAKEN ON HIS LIFE."
[1:39:30] SO WITH HIS name comes his life. And and
[1:39:34] I WON'T HOLD YOU MUCH longer this
[1:39:35] morning. You can look at Ephesians 2:19.
[1:39:38] Now therefore, you're no more STRANGERS
[1:39:40] AND FOREIGNERS, BUT FELLOW CITIZENS WITH
[1:39:43] THE SAINTS OF THE HOUSEHOLD OF GOD.
[1:39:46] HALLELUJAH. SO YOU'RE YOU'RE A STRANGER
[1:39:48] HERE, BUT YOU'RE NOT A STRANGER TO GOD.
[1:39:50] YOU SEE, YOU MIGHT THINK THAT GOD HAS
[1:39:52] FORGOTTEN ABOUT YOU. You know, HE'S
[1:39:53] FORSAKEN ME. I've done too many wrongs.
[1:39:56] But brother Brown, I'm going to talk
[1:39:57] about the Jews and how that that the
[1:39:59] 144,000 is going to be brought out,
[1:40:02] right? AND HE SAYS, BUT HOW DO THEY KNOW
[1:40:04] WHO'S JEW? Because they lost all of
[1:40:07] their records. THEY'VE LOST THEY'VE LOST
[1:40:09] EVERYTHING. BUT THEN HE WAS STUCK AND
[1:40:11] WOULD SAY, BUT GOD KNOWS THEM.
[1:40:13] HALLELUJAH. THEY MIGHT NOT HAVE RECORDS
[1:40:15] OF WHO THEIR IDENTITY IS OR THEY CAN'T
[1:40:18] TRACE IT ALL THE WAY BACK, BUT GOD KNOWS
[1:40:21] WHO THOSE 144,000 ARE. BUT WHAT ABOUT
[1:40:24] THE BRIDE OF CHRIST? YOU MIGHT FEEL LIKE
[1:40:27] YOU'RE A STRANGER TO GOD. YOU MIGHT
[1:40:29] FEEL, BUT LET ME SAY THIS. YOU ARE NO
[1:40:32] LONGER A STRANGER, BUT YOUR FELLOW
[1:40:34] CITIZENS WITH THE SAINTS OF GOD IN THE
[1:40:36] HOUSEHOLD OF GOD. GOD WILL NOT LOSE A
[1:40:39] ONE OF THEM. YOUR NAME IS ENGRAVED IN
[1:40:42] THE PALM OF MY HAND. IN OTHER WORDS, YOU
[1:40:44] MIGHT FEEL LIKE A STRANGER, BUT I KNOW
[1:40:46] YOU. I'M NOT GOING TO FORSAKE YOU. I'M
[1:40:48] NOT GOING TO FORGET ABOUT YOU. BUT I
[1:40:51] KNOW YOU. HALLELUJAH. WE BELONG
[1:40:53] SOMEWHERE NOW. HALLELUJAH. And it's
[1:40:55] always it's terrible whenever you you're
[1:40:57] at a new place and you don't feel like
[1:40:59] you fit in, RIGHT? AND WE'VE BEEN THAT
[1:41:01] WAY THROUGH THROUGH LEORA, BUT NOW WE
[1:41:04] HAVE FOUND A SAFE HAVEN. NOW WE'VE
[1:41:06] ENTERED IN BEHIND THE VEIL AND WE'RE
[1:41:08] LIVING IN A SAFE PLACE WHERE WE FEEL
[1:41:11] LIKE WE BELONG. WE'RE SHUT IN WITH GOD.
[1:41:14] HALLELUJAH. WE'RE SHUT IN WITH GOD. AND
[1:41:16] AND ONE definition of soldier is a
[1:41:19] temporary stay. And I thought that's
[1:41:21] powerful. We're only here temporarily.
[1:41:24] And the Bible would say in Hebrews
[1:41:26] 13:14, "For here we have no continuing
[1:41:29] city, but we seek one to come." In other
[1:41:32] words, we're here temporarily, but our
[1:41:34] our direction is not temporary, BUT IT'S
[1:41:38] SOLID. IT IS SECURED. And you can look
[1:41:40] in the book of Genesis ON HOW THAT GOD
[1:41:43] would tell Abraham that his seed was
[1:41:45] going to sojurnn in a land that was not
[1:41:47] there, a strange land that was not their
[1:41:50] soldier. In other words, they're going
[1:41:51] to be THERE TEMPORARILY, BUT I'M GOING
[1:41:53] TO COME DOWN AND I'M going to bring them
[1:41:56] out. And then he would say this in
[1:41:57] Genesis 15:14, "And also that nation
[1:42:01] whom they shall serve will I judge, and
[1:42:03] afterward they shall come out with great
[1:42:05] substance." In other words, the land
[1:42:08] that they're living in is only
[1:42:10] temporarily. BUT THE PROMISES I'VE GIVEN
[1:42:13] THEM IS ETERNAL. THEY'RE GOING TO COME
[1:42:15] OUT WITH GREAT SUBSTANCE. WE'RE IN
[1:42:17] LEGONIA, WHICH IS WHICH IS TEMPORARILY,
[1:42:20] BUT SUBSTANCE that he's given you. FAITH
[1:42:23] IS THE SUBSTANCE THAT IS NOT TEMPORARILY
[1:42:26] BUT THAT IS SOMETHING THAT IS ETERNAL
[1:42:29] THAT IS GOING TO HOLD YOU IN THE TEST OF
[1:42:32] TIME. HALLELUJAH. See they were in a
[1:42:35] land that that that they were
[1:42:36] temporarily in a land but you can look
[1:42:39] at Joseph. What would Joseph say? Don't
[1:42:41] bury my bones here. But when you leave
[1:42:43] AND HE WOULD PROPHESY OVER THEM AND
[1:42:45] WOULD SAY GOD'S GOING TO VISIT YOU. AND
[1:42:47] WHEN HE DOES TAKE MY BONES WITH YOU. HE
[1:42:50] KNEW THAT WE'RE IN THIS PLACE
[1:42:51] TEMPORARILY. BUT WE'RE GOING TO A PLACE
[1:42:54] THAT GOD HAS CALLED US TO BE IN. AND I
[1:42:57] SAY, "DON'T SAY DON'T LEAVE MY BONES
[1:42:59] HERE. DON'T LEAVE ME HERE. BUT WHEN THE
[1:43:01] VOICE OF RESURRECTION COMES, IF I'M IN
[1:43:03] THE IN THE GRAVE, DON'T LEAVE ME HERE.
[1:43:06] BUT I'LL MEET YOU." AND ON THE OTHER
[1:43:08] SIDE, THOSE WHO ARE ALIVE AND REMAIN
[1:43:10] WILL BE CAUGHT UP TOGETHER. HALLELUJAH.
[1:43:13] WE'RE HERE TEMPORARILY, BUT WE'RE GOING
[1:43:15] TO A PLACE WHICH IS ETERNAL. That's
[1:43:18] right.
[1:43:19] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. [screaming]
[1:43:20] WE'RE GOING TO A place which is eternal.
[1:43:23] Brother Brandham said that every Hebrew
[1:43:25] THAT WOULD WALK BY AND SEE those bones,
[1:43:27] remember the promise. They knew that
[1:43:28] those bones are here. God hasn't visited
[1:43:31] us yet. But when he does visit, we're
[1:43:33] all going. He says everyone that went by
[1:43:35] said no MATTER HOW HIS IF HIS BACK WAS
[1:43:37] BEAT, they could look at those bones and
[1:43:40] could remember God was going to take him
[1:43:42] out. But the Brand say Abraham would buy
[1:43:44] a burying ground for Sarah. And he says
[1:43:46] he didn't want to bear here just
[1:43:48] anywhere but it had to be in the place
[1:43:50] where the voice of resurrection was
[1:43:52] going to come to. And you see brother
[1:43:54] Brandon would say and he goes to many
[1:43:57] many of these these examples but he says
[1:43:59] it was quickening power that's going to
[1:44:02] take that would take us that it's a
[1:44:03] spoonful of dust. He's going to take us
[1:44:06] out of the grave one day because we're
[1:44:08] in the place where the voice of
[1:44:09] resurrection is going to come to. And
[1:44:11] brother Brandon would say God hadn't
[1:44:13] promised a resurrection down there in
[1:44:15] Egypt, but they knew that the
[1:44:17] resurrection was going to be in the
[1:44:19] promised land. And on the day when when
[1:44:21] Jesus finally come, the redeemer, they
[1:44:24] did it to him like they SAID THEY WOULD.
[1:44:27] HE DIED, BURIED. On the third day, he
[1:44:29] rose. And those that was buried up there
[1:44:31] with him, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, the
[1:44:34] saints came out of the grave. They know
[1:44:36] the resurrection was going to take place
[1:44:38] in Palestine because it was spiritually
[1:44:41] revealed to them. And I believe that we
[1:44:44] we found the place where God is going to
[1:44:47] visit us. AND I BELIEVE HE is visiting
[1:44:49] us. IT AIN'T SOMETHING IN THE FUTURE. I
[1:44:52] SAY BURY me in THIS MESSAGE. I SAID BURY
[1:44:54] YOURSELF IN THE MESSAGE. DIG INTO THE
[1:44:56] MESSAGE. DIG INTO THOSE TAPES AND GET A
[1:44:59] spiritual revealed truth that this is
[1:45:02] where God is visiting. Let our musicians
[1:45:05] come this even this morning.
[1:45:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:45:09] [applause]
[1:45:10] &gt;&gt; Brother Brown, Exodus 13:18.
[1:45:14] &gt;&gt; But God led the children or led the
[1:45:16] people about through the way of the
[1:45:18] wilderness of the Red Sea. And the
[1:45:20] children of Israel went up harnessed out
[1:45:22] of the land of Egypt. And Moses took the
[1:45:25] bones of Joseph with him. For he has
[1:45:27] straightly sworn the children of Israel,
[1:45:29] saying, "God will surely visit you, and
[1:45:32] you shall carry up my bones away hence
[1:45:34] with you." I love that they went up
[1:45:36] harnessed out of Egypt, out of the land
[1:45:38] of Egypt. The Bible would say they went
[1:45:40] out on eagle's wings. Brother Brand
[1:45:42] said, "What was those eagle's wings?" It
[1:45:44] was the message Moses was packing.
[1:45:46] Hallelujah.
[1:45:47] &gt;&gt; I believe that we are harnessed to the
[1:45:49] message of the hour. We're tied to it.
[1:45:52] That's why the Apostle Paul was saying,
[1:45:53] "None of these things move me." Brother
[1:45:55] Brandham says he was harnessed to the
[1:45:57] will of God. He was tied to something
[1:45:59] that when winds blow, winds blow, winds
[1:46:02] come and go. We're not a vagabond. If
[1:46:05] you look up that word vagabon, it means
[1:46:06] tossed about, means the totter. It means
[1:46:09] to be blown about. That's serpent seat,
[1:46:11] but not the bride of Christ. The harness
[1:46:14] to something. The harness to the voice
[1:46:16] of resurrection. The harness.
[1:46:19] Hallelujah. Brother Brandham must say,
[1:46:21] "Heavens will shake, the earth will
[1:46:22] shake, heavens and earth will pass away,
[1:46:25] but the word will never pass away. For
[1:46:27] upon this rock, I'll build my church,
[1:46:30] and the gates of hell will never prevail
[1:46:32] against it. Everything that that that
[1:46:34] that can be shook will be shaken. But we
[1:46:37] receive a kingdom, which is the word of
[1:46:40] God himself, and God is his word, and he
[1:46:43] don't shake himself." Amen. But we
[1:46:45] receive a kingdom that cannot be
[1:46:47] [clears throat] moved. It's unshakable.
[1:46:50] Hallelujah. Are you resting in it? Are
[1:46:52] you resting in it? You remember brother
[1:46:54] Brandham would go beyond the curtain of
[1:46:55] time. And he would say, you know, I
[1:46:57] preached what Paul preached. And the
[1:46:59] multitudes would say, we're resting on
[1:47:01] it. Even though they went by the way of
[1:47:03] the grave, they were still tied to it.
[1:47:05] THEY WERE STILL HARNESSED TO IT. WE'RE
[1:47:07] BEING CARRIED by this message.
[1:47:09] Hallelujah. See, in order to be carried
[1:47:11] by something, you got to give up and
[1:47:12] rely. I'M GIVING UP and I'm relying ON
[1:47:14] THIS MESSAGE. I'M HARNESSED to it and
[1:47:17] we're resting on it. [music] Are you
[1:47:19] riding on it this morning? Brother
[1:47:21] Brandon would say, "If you're not, jump
[1:47:22] on." Remember the log, Brother Brandon
[1:47:25] would tell the story of how he would
[1:47:26] jump on the log and the man in the
[1:47:28] vision would jump on the log and say,
[1:47:29] "I'm riding [music] on it. I'm riding on
[1:47:30] it. I'm riding on it." And he says,
[1:47:33] "We're riding on this word. Heavens and
[1:47:35] earth will pass away, [music]
[1:47:37] &gt;&gt; but this word will never fail." Let's
[1:47:40] bow our heads this morning. [music] Dear
[1:47:42] gracious heavenly father,
[1:47:45] Lord, how wonderful you are to us, Lord,
[1:47:46] [music]
[1:47:48] [snorts] thank you for the claim that
[1:47:49] you have on our lives.
[1:47:52] Lord, you would tell, your prophet would
[1:47:54] tell us that we were claimed in the
[1:47:56] devil's pawn shop, but then you would
[1:47:58] come and claim us out of it. [music]
[1:48:01] Lord, we're thankful that you placed an
[1:48:04] elected seed on the inside of our
[1:48:06] hearts,
[1:48:07] Lord. Though even though we're
[1:48:09] strangers, you've elected us and has
[1:48:11] claimed [music] us in this generation.
[1:48:15] Lord, I ask if there's some that is
[1:48:16] weary in mind and in body this [music]
[1:48:19] morning. Father, Lord, may they come up
[1:48:21] to El Shadi
[1:48:24] and give some strength, Lord. Your
[1:48:26] prophet would tell us that Abraham would
[1:48:28] [music] nurse a body change from El
[1:48:30] Shadi,
[1:48:32] Lord. And I ask that if there's some
[1:48:33] that is weary, [music]
[1:48:35] Lord, may they draw strength from you.
[1:48:38] Your prophet would tell us, El Shy,
[1:48:40] don't just strengthen, but he satisfies.
[1:48:43] [music] And Lord, I believe that if
[1:48:45] there's some here that ain't satisfied,
[1:48:48] Lord, may this draw from your strength,
[1:48:50] Lord, that they can be satisfied,
[1:48:52] that this is the word for me, that this
[1:48:55] is my direction, this is my future.
[1:48:59] Lord, I ask that you'd be with us the
[1:49:01] rest of the day [music] in Jesus name.
[1:49:05] Amen.
[1:49:08] What are you playing?
[1:49:10] Awesome.
[1:49:12] Oh, he's awesome. [music and singing]

[1:53:58] Oh my. Our God is tremendous.
[1:54:01] Amen. Did you enjoy that service this
[1:54:04] morning? Did he speak to your heart this
[1:54:07] morning? [music]
[1:54:08] Are you glad that you're a child of God
[1:54:10] this morning?
[1:54:12] Amen. And can we sing that song? I am a

[1:55:47] You unravel me. Yes, Lord. With a meloy.
[1:55:52] [singing]
[1:55:54] You surround [music]
[1:55:57] me with
[1:55:58] a song [music]
