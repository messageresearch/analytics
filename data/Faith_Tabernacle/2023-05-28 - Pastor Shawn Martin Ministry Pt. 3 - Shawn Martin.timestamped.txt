[47:51] it's good to have Dad and Mom here with
[47:53] us and we've certainly enjoyed their
[47:56] time
[47:58] haven't got to spend just a lot of time
[48:00] amen with them there but we've enjoyed
[48:05] the time we've had amen First
[48:09] Corinthians the fourth chapter
[48:12] says let a man
[48:15] so account of us as of the Ministers of
[48:18] Christ and stewards
[48:20] of the mystery of God
[48:22] amen you can have your seeds
[48:29] and
[48:30] um
[48:33] my subject today again is just Ministry
[48:38] and uh
[48:44] looking throughout history of the world
[48:48] time up to this day
[48:52] we see that there's all different kinds
[48:54] of Ministries
[48:56] within within Christendom itself
[49:01] we talked about how that Nations have
[49:03] their Ministries kingdoms and things but
[49:05] within Christendom
[49:07] uh there's different kinds of Ministries
[49:10] and
[49:12] and there's many reasons as to why they
[49:15] they exist different agendas different
[49:17] motives and and things but when we trace
[49:21] it all back
[49:22] uh to the the beginning we see that
[49:28] that there are only two sources that
[49:30] Ministry comes from
[49:32] and and you know usually when we think
[49:36] of ministry we think of the faithful
[49:37] Ministry but
[49:40] um I I think all of us are part of the
[49:43] ministry we we all have a Ministry
[49:47] and but there's only two sources that
[49:49] that Ministry comes from and that's
[49:51] either God or or Satan
[49:54] and so
[49:56] Ministry comes from these two sources
[49:59] and we know that not all Ministry comes
[50:01] from God
[50:03] um
[50:04] um we we look here at uh Second
[50:07] Corinthians 11 and 13 it says for such
[50:11] are false Apostles deceitful workers
[50:15] transforming themselves into the
[50:17] Apostles of Christ and no Marvel for
[50:20] Satan himself is transformed into an
[50:23] angel of Light therefore it is no great
[50:26] thing if his ministers also be
[50:29] transformed as the Ministers of
[50:31] righteousness whose end shall be
[50:33] according to their works
[50:35] so then this tells us that Satan has his
[50:38] ministers which are demons they
[50:40] and they're they're working for Satan's
[50:43] kingdom and uh we we've looked at it
[50:48] that you know Minister
[50:50] uh uh means it's it's one who gives Aid
[50:54] or service to that's what a minister is
[50:57] it's a representative of something an
[51:00] ambassador a spokesperson and so a
[51:04] minister is an agent
[51:06] that's what a minister would be uh just
[51:09] looking up the the different uh things
[51:12] that a minister is and ministers one
[51:15] that acts or exerts power that produces
[51:18] or is capable of producing an effect
[51:23] uh a means or instrument by which a
[51:27] guiding intelligence
[51:29] achieves a result
[51:32] a minister one who is authorized to act
[51:35] four or in the place of another
[51:39] so that this is what a minister is or an
[51:42] agent or or whatever it's one that acts
[51:46] or exerts power that produces or is
[51:49] capable of producing an effect
[51:52] a means or instrument by which a guiding
[51:55] intelligence achieves a result one who
[51:59] is authorized to act four or in the
[52:03] place of another
[52:05] and so when you look at it Paul the
[52:08] Apostle says that he was an ambassador
[52:10] and and I think all of us are
[52:13] ambassadors uh uh but he said that he
[52:17] was an ambassador of Christ and and and
[52:20] so uh everyone uh who is a minister
[52:25] um is an authorized uh uh representative
[52:30] or messenger I and I I think that's
[52:35] um uh we we we're part of something
[52:37] bigger than ourselves
[52:40] uh every father every mother every
[52:43] preacher singer musician every young
[52:47] person uh that is part of the body you
[52:51] you are a minister and so therefore
[52:53] you're a representative of of uh or a
[52:57] messenger uh because you are a minister
[53:01] and so uh uh Satan has his
[53:04] representative uh who they are anointed
[53:09] to carry out his plan and agenda
[53:12] uh thinking just of a scripture that
[53:15] Paul uh said there in Acts 13 and 7 and
[53:21] he's talking to this Sorcerer And he
[53:23] says you know
[53:24] um oh full of all subtleity and all
[53:28] Mischief thou child of the devil thou
[53:31] enemy of all righteousness without not
[53:34] cease to pervert the right ways of the
[53:38] Lord and so this this man uh uh Jesus
[53:43] called or Paul would call him the child
[53:45] of the devil and he was an anointed to
[53:48] to to pervert the ways of the Lord and
[53:52] here Paul was an ambassador of Christ
[53:55] and and and and then this man comes and
[53:58] opposes uh uh the the the Ambassador for
[54:03] Christ and Paul just called it out and
[54:06] said you're working for the devil you
[54:07] you are trying to pervert the ways of
[54:10] God and so so this is what his anointing
[54:15] was was to pervert the right ways of the
[54:18] Lord you look at Paul in Galatians 1 and
[54:21] 6
[54:22] saying to the Galatians there I Marvel
[54:25] that you are so soon removed from him
[54:28] that called you into the grace of Christ
[54:30] unto another gospel which is not another
[54:34] but there be some that trouble you and
[54:37] would pervert the gospel of Christ and
[54:41] so this battle of of right and wrong
[54:45] it's it's always been there and and it
[54:48] and it comes through the ministry it
[54:50] comes through Ministry it it Satan
[54:53] wouldn't have any effect if if he didn't
[54:56] have his agents if he didn't have if he
[54:58] didn't have his ministry well God
[55:00] wouldn't be effective uh and and we'll
[55:03] go more into that but he he wouldn't be
[55:05] effective without his ministry amen uh
[55:09] he chose Ministry and so therefore uh
[55:13] Before Time began we all know it but
[55:16] there was a battle that raged a war and
[55:19] that was between God and Satan God
[55:22] established his his kingdom he he
[55:25] created his angels and and these things
[55:28] and and we know that that uh uh the
[55:31] Angels they have levels of positions and
[55:35] well as Satan was next to God as Lucifer
[55:39] he was the above all the angels all the
[55:42] Angels were under his command and and uh
[55:46] uh so he was he was in the position he
[55:48] was next to God and and of course he he
[55:52] wasn't happy being next to God in
[55:54] position and and he wasn't happy with
[55:57] what he he had he wanted to be God and
[56:00] he wanted to be worshiped as God all
[56:03] these other angels are worshiping God
[56:05] and and no one was there to worship him
[56:07] and he wanted he wanted worship he
[56:10] wanted a better Kingdom and so uh uh so
[56:14] he he he takes the reality of God's
[56:19] kingdom away uh uh from from the people
[56:23] uh he was jealous of Michael the prophet
[56:26] said the Archangel and so in his pride
[56:30] he rebelled and and uh he calls the
[56:34] third of the angels to join him and we
[56:38] know them as Fallen Angels or demons and
[56:41] and they are his ministers working to
[56:44] fulfill his purpose ain't that right
[56:47] amen so what is his purpose we know the
[56:50] scriptures very well that Isaiah 14 12
[56:53] it says how art thou fallen from Heaven
[56:56] o Lucifer uh son of the morning and we
[56:59] know that that God kicked him out of
[57:00] heaven and and his place was upon the
[57:04] Earth he no longer had his position next
[57:07] to God and he was a fallen angel but he
[57:10] was a beautiful angel and and and so
[57:13] Thou Art fallen from Heaven o Lucifer
[57:15] son of the morning how art thou cut to
[57:17] the ground which did US weak in the
[57:19] Nations
[57:20] for thou Hast said in thine heart I will
[57:23] Ascend into heaven I will exalt my
[57:25] throne above the stars of God or sons of
[57:29] God I will sit also upon the Mount of
[57:32] the congregation in the sides of the
[57:34] north I will Ascend above the heights of
[57:37] the clouds I will be like the most high
[57:41] so so he just doesn't start out to set
[57:44] establish his own kingdom but he wants
[57:47] to be God he he so he's he's he sets out
[57:51] to be an impersonator is is really what
[57:55] he does and so we know now here on Earth
[57:58] that Paul would the the Ambassador for
[58:02] God uh uh he a representative there in
[58:06] second Thessalonians two and three he
[58:09] says let no man deceive you by any means
[58:11] for that day shall not come except there
[58:13] come a falling away first and that men
[58:16] of men of sin be revealed the son of
[58:18] perdition
[58:20] who upholdsth and exalteth himself above
[58:24] all that is called God ain't that right
[58:27] so so he's he's opposing and exalting
[58:31] himself above the very word of God for
[58:35] God is the word ain't that right and and
[58:38] so uh he opposes the exalteth himself
[58:42] above all that is called God or that is
[58:44] worshiped so that he as God sitteth in
[58:47] the temple of God showing himself that
[58:50] he is God ain't that right I don't think
[58:53] that any any part of of ministry uh uh
[58:58] especially in this day when the the
[59:00] uncovering has has been uh the the veil
[59:05] has been lifted off that that we we do
[59:08] not recognize or cannot uh recognize the
[59:13] the power or the agenda of Satan uh uh I
[59:18] think every Minister uh uh should be
[59:21] capable and I believe God has has
[59:24] enabled Us in this age to recognize the
[59:28] power of Satan the agenda of Satan the
[59:30] working and and what what he is after
[59:34] ain't that rhyme so he is he he has
[59:37] sought all the way from you know before
[59:41] creation of man he has sought to
[59:44] establish himself as God to have a
[59:47] kingdom as God to be God to be worshiped
[59:50] as God and so and then his ministers uh
[59:55] uh uh they're they're working for this
[59:59] purpose and so Satan is able to
[1:00:02] establish his goal his agenda through
[1:00:06] perversion by perverting ain't that
[1:00:08] rhyme and and we know that his kingdom
[1:00:12] is established uh through perverting
[1:00:14] God's word he has perverted God's
[1:00:17] creation he has perverted the family
[1:00:19] that God God intended for family to be
[1:00:22] he has perverted the church the way God
[1:00:26] intended for the church to operate and
[1:00:28] to be he has perverted the minds of the
[1:00:31] people amen uh totally different than
[1:00:35] the way God has wanted man to be he has
[1:00:39] perverted the relationship between God
[1:00:42] and his people ain't that right it's all
[1:00:45] been a perversion of of Satan and and we
[1:00:50] know as the prophet said the lids come
[1:00:52] off of Hell in this age and and of
[1:00:56] course Satan has been able to to uh come
[1:01:00] to a Perfection of his his he not God's
[1:01:03] Eden his Eden and and we are living in
[1:01:06] Satan's Eden do you believe that amen
[1:01:09] we're living in his eating Eden and and
[1:01:13] we are the only ones as the people of
[1:01:16] God the ambassadors of God uh uh the
[1:01:21] ministry of God that that is stopping
[1:01:24] and hindering from from him coming into
[1:01:28] his completion uh complete thoughts and
[1:01:31] agenda and and these things we are the
[1:01:33] one and and so here's the struggle
[1:01:36] because he's he's almost come to a
[1:01:39] finale in in what he wants he's got the
[1:01:42] majority of the people worshiping him
[1:01:44] he's he's got it all he's in control of
[1:01:47] churches he's in control of homes he's
[1:01:49] in control of politics he's in control
[1:01:52] of Nations he's in control of people's
[1:01:55] lives people's minds and he's in control
[1:01:58] of the children he's in control of the
[1:02:00] wife the the husband he's in control of
[1:02:02] the ministers he's in control of just
[1:02:05] about any everything and there's a
[1:02:08] sliver of people that he cannot control
[1:02:12] and and so so the war is really raging
[1:02:16] because girls he has set out to do to
[1:02:19] defeat all of God's kingdom he is set
[1:02:22] out to destroy everything the purpose of
[1:02:25] God and so here we're standing in his
[1:02:28] way you understand what I'm saying so
[1:02:30] now the the prophet said the lived the
[1:02:33] lids come off of hell and I believe we
[1:02:36] can all say Amen to that right the
[1:02:38] streams of demon power is pouring from
[1:02:41] everywhere
[1:02:43] he said it's conquered the Nations it's
[1:02:46] conquered politics still it's rotten to
[1:02:48] the core it's conquered the churches
[1:02:50] until they know nothing but denomination
[1:02:53] so Satan has actually taken the worship
[1:02:57] from God and has put it upon himself now
[1:03:02] has he done that well materialistic
[1:03:04] things everybody say materialistic
[1:03:06] things
[1:03:07] have now become the object of worship
[1:03:10] they're inspired of the devil scientific
[1:03:13] things are now become the object of
[1:03:16] worship and it's nothing but an
[1:03:19] inspiration of the devil education is
[1:03:22] now the object of worship and it too is
[1:03:25] inspired of the devil ain't that right
[1:03:28] we've even gotten a perversion in in
[1:03:31] Christmas to where Santa Claus has taken
[1:03:34] the worship from Jesus Christ it's
[1:03:36] inspired of the devil ain't that right
[1:03:39] you see anything that takes the people's
[1:03:42] Faith away from God is of the devil
[1:03:46] anything that takes the people's
[1:03:49] dependency away from God is of the devil
[1:03:52] anything that takes the people's
[1:03:55] attention away from God and His word is
[1:03:59] of the devil anything that causes people
[1:04:02] not to understand or to not to hear
[1:04:06] God's word is of the devil ain't that
[1:04:09] right so actually through these things
[1:04:12] Satan has achieved his purpose and he
[1:04:15] has become the the object of worship
[1:04:18] through his achievements ain't that
[1:04:21] right amen that that's right amen people
[1:04:24] depend upon science uh more than they do
[1:04:27] God's word they depend upon medicine
[1:04:29] more than they do God's word
[1:04:31] ain't that right Amen brother Brown said
[1:04:34] it'll be a day that faith will be very
[1:04:36] slow faith will be more slow because
[1:04:39] we've got more hospitals we've got more
[1:04:42] uh uh uh achievements of man than than
[1:04:45] ever before to where God's word it seems
[1:04:49] to be dinosaur it's it's historic we've
[1:04:52] got all these modern days inventions of
[1:04:55] today you understand what I'm saying
[1:04:57] that it's hard for people just to take
[1:04:59] God at his word so then we can say that
[1:05:03] Satan has achieved his purpose he is
[1:05:06] behind education he is behind science he
[1:05:10] is behind a man the denominations he is
[1:05:13] behind all of these things I I say he's
[1:05:16] behind the sports I'd say he's behind
[1:05:18] the entertainment I say he's behind
[1:05:20] everything to where the people are
[1:05:22] finding more joy in in them things than
[1:05:25] they are the house of God the word of
[1:05:28] God the uh uh all of these things people
[1:05:31] become more loyal Amen to the worldly
[1:05:34] things and they do God and His word it's
[1:05:38] just that way look at more people that
[1:05:40] are tied tied down by materialistic
[1:05:44] things whether it be money pleasure uh
[1:05:47] uh jobs or or whatever they're more tied
[1:05:49] down to that and more and they trust
[1:05:52] that more for their future and security
[1:05:54] than they do the word of God so then we
[1:05:58] can understand that that that that that
[1:06:00] that Satan has actually become the
[1:06:03] object of worship through his
[1:06:05] achievements ain't that right yes sir so
[1:06:09] so brother Branham said his works are
[1:06:11] exalted above God's word and manifested
[1:06:15] work so God's word has come he has
[1:06:18] manifested his works but Satan's works
[1:06:22] are exalted above these Works ain't that
[1:06:25] right denominations that have been
[1:06:27] established amen by by the devil have
[1:06:30] become more uh exalted than God's word
[1:06:34] creed from the devil uh darkmas and
[1:06:38] traditions of men are inspired of the
[1:06:41] devil and they have become more exalted
[1:06:44] than God's Vindicated word ain't that
[1:06:46] right so brother Branham said see the
[1:06:49] wisdom of Satan is exalted to the throne
[1:06:53] of worship in man above the Vindicated
[1:06:57] word of God for the hour
[1:07:01] our churches prove that by their
[1:07:03] seminaries schools of learning that's
[1:07:06] learned more than God's word knows about
[1:07:09] it they think see see there Dr so and so
[1:07:12] and teacher so and so and Professor so
[1:07:15] and so has exalted their own knowledge
[1:07:18] so-called from Satan truth see above the
[1:07:22] Vindicated promise of God made clear
[1:07:25] right before them and men fall for it
[1:07:28] see his scientific achievements trying
[1:07:30] to prove God's word wrong just think of
[1:07:33] that it's just like like a one man
[1:07:35] claiming to be in the message still and
[1:07:38] and yet he is he has taken he is he has
[1:07:41] uh taken the um the picture of the seven
[1:07:45] angels and he has sent it off to the
[1:07:47] science uh scientific whatever for them
[1:07:50] to prove that that it was right to prove
[1:07:54] that what brother Branham said was was
[1:07:56] was true and and was right and he was
[1:08:00] telling you know brother Andrew and he
[1:08:02] says we need we need science to prove
[1:08:04] that it's right be so so we can convince
[1:08:08] the world that it's right well I don't
[1:08:10] need science to prove it Noah didn't
[1:08:12] have have proof a man by science that
[1:08:16] there was going to be a rain but it
[1:08:17] rained anyways amen and he ain't going
[1:08:20] to be guilty before God to say well I
[1:08:22] didn't have science proof you know I
[1:08:25] should have maybe had scientific proof
[1:08:26] to get more souls into the ark God
[1:08:28] didn't need scientific proof it wasn't
[1:08:30] up to Noah to Amen to have scientific
[1:08:33] proof it was just Noah up to Noah to be
[1:08:36] a minister of the word of God and priest
[1:08:39] that it's going to rain can you say amen
[1:08:41] amen proof we don't need proof amen but
[1:08:45] yet God would give us proof God gave us
[1:08:48] Vindication as to as to these things
[1:08:50] ain't that right amen but a Believer
[1:08:53] don't need proof amen he just believes
[1:08:55] ain't that right amen see so so we men
[1:08:59] fall for this and and and so uh Satan's
[1:09:03] scientific achievements trying to prove
[1:09:05] God's word wrong just think of that he
[1:09:08] his and that is the man's theology
[1:09:11] explains God's word to the people and
[1:09:15] makes it of no effect again so that's
[1:09:17] the kind of ministry that Satan has to
[1:09:19] make the word of God of no effect ain't
[1:09:23] that right see uh to the people see and
[1:09:26] like he had in the denominational age
[1:09:29] when Jesus appeared on the earth Jesus
[1:09:31] said you Hypocrites you by your
[1:09:33] tradition that's their interpretation
[1:09:35] has taken the word of God and made it of
[1:09:38] no effect to the people that's the same
[1:09:41] thing they've done today it doesn't have
[1:09:44] the effect ain't that right a man doing
[1:09:47] a lot of quote reading quote but he says
[1:09:49] they the people exalt him Satan above
[1:09:53] all that's called God he said doesn't uh
[1:09:56] second Thessalonians say they would do
[1:09:58] that the authority of a denominator
[1:10:00] National Church the people believing
[1:10:03] that denomination more than they believe
[1:10:05] God and God is the word ain't that right
[1:10:08] say believing these things more than we
[1:10:11] would believe God's word and then you
[1:10:13] know it's it's inspired of of of the the
[1:10:18] devil amen they'll believe their
[1:10:20] denominational Creed above the word
[1:10:22] which exalts him above all that's called
[1:10:27] God and there's only one God and that's
[1:10:30] the word see all that's called God so he
[1:10:35] as God sits in the Church of the god uh
[1:10:39] proven that he is God because he's got
[1:10:42] the people worshiping him God is the
[1:10:45] word and he exalts himself above all
[1:10:48] that's called God and there's only one
[1:10:50] God and that God is the word ain't that
[1:10:53] right and all that's called God is the
[1:10:56] God of this age has exalted himself
[1:10:59] above the true Vindicator word of God
[1:11:01] see above all that's called God so that
[1:11:05] he as God sits in the temple of God with
[1:11:07] authority notice what he says and look
[1:11:10] he is praised for it Satan is praised
[1:11:14] for it see through all of these things
[1:11:17] he's caused the people to look at
[1:11:19] something else instead of the word of
[1:11:22] God God help us ain't that right to uh
[1:11:25] uh to stay with that word of God to look
[1:11:28] at the word of God instead of looking
[1:11:30] the word of God is our comfort
[1:11:33] ain't that right the word of God is our
[1:11:37] comforter
[1:11:37] not not not not not not
[1:11:40] fishing trips not vacations
[1:11:43] not the preacher not your wife not your
[1:11:47] husband not your children not your
[1:11:49] parents the word of God is the comforter
[1:11:52] ain't that right and to find the Comfort
[1:11:55] outside of that is an inspiration that
[1:11:58] is coming from the Devil
[1:12:00] ain't that right so he's praised for it
[1:12:03] oh let the people God see that deception
[1:12:06] he has praised for it and solemnly
[1:12:09] believed by the people of this age now
[1:12:12] do you see the god in his servants of
[1:12:15] this evil age see so what's he doing
[1:12:18] he's making a better world a man for the
[1:12:22] people and this is what he's saying
[1:12:24] we're making a better world for the
[1:12:27] people see and totally ignoring the word
[1:12:30] of God that there is no better world
[1:12:33] except the Millennium there can be no
[1:12:36] better World there cannot be a perfect
[1:12:38] world as long as there's politics
[1:12:41] involved in this as long as there's sin
[1:12:44] and Corruption and and education is at
[1:12:47] the at the at its peak and and all of
[1:12:51] these things see so he said see he's lit
[1:12:54] he says he is making a better world for
[1:12:56] the people to live in by his knowledge
[1:12:59] apart from the never failing word of God
[1:13:02] so he says by his coming together
[1:13:05] denominational Creeds intellectual and
[1:13:08] scientific and so forth he is making a
[1:13:11] better world for Mandalay event and
[1:13:14] ignoring the promise of God ain't that
[1:13:17] right and what is that promise a
[1:13:19] millennium what is that promise a time
[1:13:22] of Peace what is that promise that Satan
[1:13:25] would be bound for a thousand years and
[1:13:27] we would be on a honeymoon can you
[1:13:29] imagine that there are people so
[1:13:31] gullible to to teach that we are living
[1:13:33] in a millennium right now
[1:13:38] it's inspired of the devil
[1:13:41] can you say that God never promised that
[1:13:43] amen politics would be in the millennium
[1:13:47] the Bible promised that we'd walk on the
[1:13:49] ashes of the wicked
[1:13:51] ain't that right and Satan would be
[1:13:53] bound by a chain of circumstance he'll
[1:13:56] have no power over you he can do nothing
[1:13:59] anymore it'll be on a honeymoon with our
[1:14:02] beloved
[1:14:03] ain't that right but it's an inspired of
[1:14:05] the devil to get people to believe look
[1:14:07] at it they're wanting a resurrection of
[1:14:09] America
[1:14:10] ain't that right it's an inspired their
[1:14:12] thoughts are inspired of the devil their
[1:14:15] prayers are inspired of the devil
[1:14:18] the Prophecies of America coming back is
[1:14:21] inspired of the devil amen what's he
[1:14:24] gotten he's got them looking for a
[1:14:27] better world a better future here right
[1:14:30] here in America when the people of God
[1:14:33] ought to be looking up
[1:14:34] Jesus said when you see these things
[1:14:37] begin to happen lift up your head your
[1:14:39] Redemption draweth now
[1:14:41] can you say Amen
[1:14:43] that's right see so so we find brother
[1:14:46] Brown said the people are ignorant of
[1:14:48] worshiping Satan but it's Satan
[1:14:50] impersonating himself as the church
[1:14:53] they worship Satan thinking they're
[1:14:55] worshiping God through the church but
[1:14:57] it's the way Satan has done it
[1:14:59] so Satan has been able to achieve his
[1:15:01] purpose through deception
[1:15:03] and and we know that he quotes
[1:15:05] scriptures
[1:15:06] but they are misplaced and misleading
[1:15:09] and that's exactly what he did to Eve
[1:15:11] and he fell for it ain't that right Amen
[1:15:14] brother Brown said see he quoted he
[1:15:16] quoted what God Said but he put a
[1:15:18] question mark to it now and I want to
[1:15:21] say this we as ministers I don't care if
[1:15:24] we're standing behind the pulpit or if
[1:15:26] we're ministering to our children or if
[1:15:28] we're fathers a man ruling and a
[1:15:30] headship over our homes you should never
[1:15:33] put a question to the word of God we're
[1:15:35] not sent to minister questions we are
[1:15:38] sent to give the answers to the people
[1:15:41] give answers I don't want you leaving
[1:15:43] with more questions I want you to leave
[1:15:46] with the answers and only God can give
[1:15:49] the answers ain't that right amen see so
[1:15:52] we want the answers not questions
[1:15:55] ain't that right that's the only way
[1:15:57] you'll be established in the faith a man
[1:15:59] is is to be established by the
[1:16:02] Revelation or the answer Amen to the
[1:16:05] questions that Satan throws at us
[1:16:07] ain't that right so so we find that he
[1:16:11] done the same thing to Jesus amen he put
[1:16:14] the question mark and he said it is
[1:16:16] written man shall not live by bread
[1:16:17] alone see right with the word quoting
[1:16:20] that word but taking him up then he
[1:16:22] tried to whitewash the word and make it
[1:16:24] some other way ain't that right but he
[1:16:27] fell for it but Jesus didn't fall for it
[1:16:29] and that's the saying today that there
[1:16:32] is a people that will not fall for it
[1:16:35] she never failed from the beginning you
[1:16:37] realize that you never fail in the
[1:16:39] beginning
[1:16:42] now brother Brown said it's that
[1:16:44] misconstruing that part of the scripture
[1:16:47] that applies to the day he'll let you
[1:16:49] know that all that Jesus did was
[1:16:51] perfectly well he'll let you know all
[1:16:52] that Moses did was perfectly well but
[1:16:55] when you take the promises that they
[1:16:57] gave for this day and then say that's
[1:16:59] applied to another age that's all he
[1:17:01] just has to do see is to get the people
[1:17:04] to believe it that way ain't that right
[1:17:06] so Satan has been able to accomplish
[1:17:08] these things uh uh through his ministry
[1:17:11] and I'd say his ministry amen now notice
[1:17:15] Acts 20 and 28 take heed therefore unto
[1:17:18] yourselves and do all the flock over uh
[1:17:21] the witch the Holy Ghost hath made you
[1:17:23] overseers talking to that that faithful
[1:17:26] Ministry to feed the Church of God which
[1:17:29] he hath purchased with his own blood for
[1:17:32] I know this that after my departing
[1:17:34] shall Grievous Woods enter in among you
[1:17:37] not sparing the flock also of your own
[1:17:40] cells shall men arrive I speaking
[1:17:42] perverse things to draw away disciples
[1:17:45] after them therefore watch and remember
[1:17:49] that by the space of three years I cease
[1:17:52] not to warn everyone night and day with
[1:17:55] tears ain't that right so this is the
[1:17:58] ministry uh that Satan had he started it
[1:18:01] amen in the beginning uh before the
[1:18:04] world uh before Man created or the
[1:18:06] creation of the the world I guess if you
[1:18:09] could say it that way but but he started
[1:18:11] to draw away from God draw the attention
[1:18:13] away from God get everything away from
[1:18:16] God unto himself and notice how it's
[1:18:18] carried out through all the ages God
[1:18:21] would send his agent in an age and and
[1:18:24] Satan would send his agent and and and
[1:18:27] and and and the word of God would be
[1:18:29] made known and and there would be uh uh
[1:18:32] uh Satan's Minister amen God's Minister
[1:18:35] would proclaim the word Satan's Minister
[1:18:37] would try to draw the people unto
[1:18:39] himself away see under perverse things
[1:18:42] ain't that right but there is a God
[1:18:46] ordained Ministry do you believe that
[1:18:48] there is a god-ordained Ministry it was
[1:18:51] established by God it it's the ministry
[1:18:55] of God Amen and that's what we are a
[1:18:58] part of I believe is that that it's the
[1:19:01] ministry of God and as I said last
[1:19:04] Sunday it was first implemented by God
[1:19:06] uh uh and in the beginning God laid the
[1:19:10] foundation for Ministry amen and and uh
[1:19:15] he established the direction for it and
[1:19:18] established its purpose and and the
[1:19:21] thing that God did establish a man for
[1:19:24] his ministry is that it would be a
[1:19:27] Supernatural Ministry it wouldn't be a
[1:19:30] carnal Ministry it would be a
[1:19:32] Supernatural Ministry it would be a
[1:19:35] Ministry of power a Ministry of
[1:19:37] Deliverance a Ministry of redemption a
[1:19:41] Ministry of Salvation a Ministry of
[1:19:43] healing a Ministry of reconciliation
[1:19:46] ain't that right and God would provide a
[1:19:51] man uh what was needed by the ministry
[1:19:55] ain't that right A Man by the way of
[1:19:58] ministry it's it's again the ministry of
[1:20:02] God why is it the ministry of God it's
[1:20:04] God moving it's God acting it's God
[1:20:07] working it's God's supplying it's a
[1:20:11] Supernatural Ministry ain't that right
[1:20:12] amen this is God's Ministry now a man
[1:20:16] see and so again Ministry is an agent or
[1:20:20] instrument a personal thing through
[1:20:23] which something is accomplished ain't
[1:20:25] that right so we could look at the first
[1:20:28] Ministry of uh of God and that would be
[1:20:32] the Holy Spirit ain't that right amen
[1:20:34] that's God's agent amen and and that
[1:20:38] brother Brandon says that many times
[1:20:39] that the holy spirit is God's agent
[1:20:42] ain't that right the Holy Spirit does
[1:20:45] not come to give uh funny feelings it's
[1:20:49] God's agent and when the Holy Spirit
[1:20:51] comes to you brother shalom it's for a
[1:20:53] purpose
[1:20:55] ain't that right well see so it's God's
[1:20:58] agent and and I I'm just giving you some
[1:21:01] definitions here but agent or agency
[1:21:04] means the capacity condition or state of
[1:21:08] acting uh or of exerting power ain't
[1:21:12] that right amen uh uh agent is is or
[1:21:16] agency is Operation amen a person or
[1:21:19] thing which through which power is
[1:21:22] exerted or an end is achieved ain't that
[1:21:27] right so oh my see so it's the capacity
[1:21:31] condition or state of acting or exerting
[1:21:34] power so we can see this this agent uh
[1:21:39] uh in the beginning a man Genesis 1 2 it
[1:21:43] says that the Earth was without form and
[1:21:46] void and darkness was upon the face of
[1:21:49] the deep ain't that right so it was an
[1:21:52] impossible situation it was Bleak it was
[1:21:55] hopeless it was all these things but it
[1:21:57] says and the spirit of God moved upon
[1:22:01] the face of the waters and what did it
[1:22:04] do as God's agent it it changed the
[1:22:07] situation as God's agent it transformed
[1:22:13] picture of bleakness to Beauty ain't
[1:22:16] that right yes sir see and then you find
[1:22:19] right after that and God said let there
[1:22:22] be light and there was what light how
[1:22:28] did he do that how did the light come
[1:22:30] through the agency of God and God's
[1:22:33] agent ain't that right amen see the Holy
[1:22:36] Spirit went into action to make sure
[1:22:39] God's word God's will was carried out
[1:22:43] amen God said let there be trees amen
[1:22:47] and the Holy Spirit began to brood over
[1:22:51] the Earth and here come the trees and
[1:22:53] God said let there be the the flowers
[1:22:56] and the Holy Spirit was sent and as
[1:22:59] God's agent now as in the ministry of
[1:23:02] God now we're talking about Ministry and
[1:23:04] he began to brood over the Earth and and
[1:23:07] up come the flowers and up come the
[1:23:09] bushes and up come uh the azaleas and
[1:23:12] and all of that and and then God wanted
[1:23:15] uh animal life an upcome of the birds
[1:23:19] and upcome this and that and and and and
[1:23:22] and all of these things and the prophet
[1:23:24] said it was because the Holy Spirit the
[1:23:27] anointed Christ a man was brooding over
[1:23:30] the Earth ain't that right amen see
[1:23:32] God's agent he's got an agency ain't
[1:23:35] that right so whatever God decreed the
[1:23:39] Holy Spirit brought it to pass amen
[1:23:42] that's why God's word will never fall to
[1:23:45] the ground he's got the right agency
[1:23:47] ain't that right amen and it's it's it's
[1:23:50] his own Spirit ain't that right so we
[1:23:53] can say and know beyond a shout of a
[1:23:55] doubt that God's word is effective do
[1:23:58] you believe that God's word is effective
[1:24:00] do you realize we've been amen we're
[1:24:03] looking at prophecy being fulfilled
[1:24:05] today that was spoken thousands and
[1:24:07] thousands of years amen and now it's
[1:24:10] being fulfilled why because God still
[1:24:13] has his agent on the scene amen and
[1:24:15] everything that God has said for this
[1:24:18] day is coming to pass
[1:24:21] it's the ministry that's right see so
[1:24:25] God said in in Zechariah 4 and 6 not by
[1:24:28] might
[1:24:29] nor by power
[1:24:31] but by my spirit saith the Lord
[1:24:33] I think we ought to depend more on the
[1:24:35] spirit of God than we have ever before
[1:24:38] ain't that right amen it's God's agent
[1:24:41] amen second Peter 1 25 or 121 for the
[1:24:45] prophecy came not in Old Time by the
[1:24:47] will of man
[1:24:49] but holy men of old amen spake as they
[1:24:54] were moved by the Holy Ghost
[1:24:57] ain't that right amen see Jesus also
[1:25:00] promised amen that the spirit of Truth
[1:25:03] would come in this day he would come and
[1:25:06] he would lead us and guide us into all
[1:25:08] truth God still God is that same agent
[1:25:12] today the Holy Ghost is nothing
[1:25:14] old-fashioned
[1:25:16] it's not outdated
[1:25:19] and you say Amen now Satan's ministry
[1:25:22] will take us away from the Holy Ghost
[1:25:25] he'll get people to think and they got
[1:25:27] the Holy Ghost when they ain't really
[1:25:28] got it
[1:25:29] you ain't that right amen and so what
[1:25:32] he's doing he's doing it through
[1:25:33] Sensations he's doing it through
[1:25:35] feelings he's doing it through all of
[1:25:38] these things because I spoke in tongues
[1:25:40] I got the holy ghost that has nothing to
[1:25:41] do with Heaven the Holy Ghost ain't that
[1:25:44] right see but he's made way for him to
[1:25:46] come into the people and speak in
[1:25:49] tongues and they think they got God in
[1:25:50] all reality they're still living like a
[1:25:53] devil still acting like Hypocrites ain't
[1:25:55] that right can't follow the truth of God
[1:25:57] and all this so all the while claiming
[1:26:00] they got the Holy Ghost if Satan has
[1:26:03] become god of the age
[1:26:06] but see God established Ministry for the
[1:26:09] sole purpose that his will be
[1:26:11] accomplished now Church no other will is
[1:26:15] going to be accomplished
[1:26:17] hello every other will is going to be
[1:26:19] thwarted by God
[1:26:21] ain't that right amen but but and and
[1:26:25] and when I say that uh no no other will
[1:26:28] will be accomplished by the ministry of
[1:26:31] God
[1:26:33] the ministry of God is sent to
[1:26:36] accomplish the will of God
[1:26:40] ain't that right the will of man will be
[1:26:42] disappointed
[1:26:44] the will of Satan will be thwarted
[1:26:46] ain't that right
[1:26:48] amen but the will of God is going to be
[1:26:50] established by Ministry
[1:26:54] it's true
[1:26:57] and we know what the will of God is is
[1:26:59] the purpose of God
[1:27:01] and the will of God is the word of God
[1:27:03] so the purpose of God is right here in
[1:27:05] the word
[1:27:07] in written word ain't that right now
[1:27:10] this word purpose is setting something
[1:27:12] set up as an object or end to be
[1:27:16] obtained
[1:27:17] so God just didn't create the world and
[1:27:21] say look what I've done he created with
[1:27:23] purpose
[1:27:24] ain't that right he created the world he
[1:27:27] created this Earth then the prophet said
[1:27:29] he took you from the Earth
[1:27:32] ain't that right he made this Earth for
[1:27:35] your purpose
[1:27:36] he he made it all for you
[1:27:39] amen see at a greater purpose and so his
[1:27:43] whole purpose there's an end to his
[1:27:45] purpose there's a goal there there's an
[1:27:48] end and through his ministry he's going
[1:27:50] to obtain it
[1:27:54] Drew
[1:27:55] now according to Ephesians 3 and 11 it's
[1:28:00] an eternal purpose that's what Paul
[1:28:01] calls it an eternal purpose
[1:28:04] so it's a purpose that will not be
[1:28:06] defeated a purpose that will not be
[1:28:09] obtained it's an eternal purpose
[1:28:12] in order for this purpose to be
[1:28:14] implemented
[1:28:15] then there had to be a decree
[1:28:18] to go forth ain't that right
[1:28:20] amen it just didn't set in the mind of
[1:28:23] God Amen but now it was decreed
[1:28:26] a man and a word decree is an order
[1:28:29] usually having the force of law
[1:28:33] a fort ordaining wheel
[1:28:36] ain't that right so it was a decree God
[1:28:40] decreed his purpose
[1:28:43] amen and when when he decreed it it set
[1:28:46] it in motion
[1:28:48] because there's a force of law behind it
[1:28:53] man
[1:28:54] now the Bible tells us what this purpose
[1:28:57] is
[1:28:58] and we know it but
[1:29:01] there there was a a group of people
[1:29:05] select group of people
[1:29:07] that he put their names in the Lamb's
[1:29:10] Book of Life
[1:29:13] before the foundation of the world
[1:29:16] now this means something because they
[1:29:19] everybody say they cannot be
[1:29:23] lost
[1:29:25] they
[1:29:27] cannot be
[1:29:29] left behind
[1:29:31] they
[1:29:33] cannot be or come up short
[1:29:38] they cannot be snatched
[1:29:42] from God's purpose and will
[1:29:45] ain't that right this group of people
[1:29:48] they were saved then
[1:29:51] when God put their name on the Lamb's
[1:29:53] Book of Life they were saved
[1:29:56] ain't that right they were called then
[1:29:59] they were glorified then
[1:30:02] when he put their name in the Lamb's
[1:30:04] Book of Life he completed their story
[1:30:07] he already wrote out their destiny
[1:30:11] ain't that right amen he put it all
[1:30:14] there
[1:30:15] yes sir see and it was all in God's
[1:30:18] thoughts they are secure
[1:30:21] ain't that right there's no way for them
[1:30:24] to be lost and if your part if your name
[1:30:27] is in the Lamb's Book of Life you cannot
[1:30:29] be lost
[1:30:30] I don't care how dark your trial is you
[1:30:32] cannot be lost I don't care how big your
[1:30:35] failure is you cannot be lost I don't
[1:30:37] care how bad of a person you were out in
[1:30:39] the world you can't be lost can you say
[1:30:42] Amen God's grace is greater than the sin
[1:30:45] God's grace is greater than the than the
[1:30:47] in in in capabilities God's grace God's
[1:30:50] strength God's Mercy is far outreaches
[1:30:53] amen the devil's grasp upon your life
[1:30:56] his grace is far stronger than Satan's
[1:31:00] hold upon you
[1:31:02] ain't that right see all in God's
[1:31:05] thoughts they are secure and they are
[1:31:08] the ones and the only ones who receive
[1:31:10] the Holy Ghost
[1:31:12] do you believe that amen now I know
[1:31:15] brother Brown said you can have the Holy
[1:31:16] Ghost upon your uh your cell your spirit
[1:31:18] amen but that's not receiving the Holy
[1:31:20] Ghost that's just something falling upon
[1:31:22] you the rain falls upon the just and the
[1:31:24] unjust anointed ain't that right but to
[1:31:27] receive the Holy Ghost Inside of You
[1:31:29] amen is to is to receive it in your soul
[1:31:35] and then the Holy Ghost will never leave
[1:31:37] you
[1:31:38] what God's agent will never leave you
[1:31:41] ain't ain't that right the ministry of
[1:31:43] God will never leave you that Ministry
[1:31:46] of God goes to work for you
[1:31:49] ain't that right and it can never be I
[1:31:52] see hearing you know uh uh a ministers
[1:31:55] uh the other the other day talking about
[1:31:57] his boys and said what he said one of my
[1:32:00] boys you know when his kid got the Holy
[1:32:02] Ghost and of course the the there's a
[1:32:05] really strange relationship right now
[1:32:07] between them and he says but
[1:32:09] he's you know uh he may have gotten the
[1:32:12] Holy Ghost but yeah uh
[1:32:15] yeah he's lost it you know he said you
[1:32:18] can have the Holy Ghost and lose it you
[1:32:20] know and he says the whole I mean then
[1:32:22] he says the Holy Ghost could be in you
[1:32:23] but you've still got to be in Christ and
[1:32:26] you know in other words you you can you
[1:32:28] can have the Holy Ghost and be lost
[1:32:30] you know and and I got thinking I
[1:32:32] thought no no no God take it back to the
[1:32:35] word
[1:32:36] ain't that right the Holy Ghost is our
[1:32:39] rest
[1:32:40] it's a security
[1:32:42] you'll never know that your name is on
[1:32:44] the Lamb's Book of Life till you get the
[1:32:45] Holy Ghost
[1:32:47] for the spirit itself Bears witness that
[1:32:49] we are the sons of God God's agent comes
[1:32:53] inside of you and begins to speak to
[1:32:55] your heart go on you are a son of God
[1:32:58] and it's God's Ministry
[1:33:01] ain't that right it's it's a resting
[1:33:04] place it's a seal and brother Brown said
[1:33:07] woe unto him that would try to break
[1:33:09] that seal can't do it and look at the
[1:33:13] Judgment that Satan's going to be come
[1:33:15] under that he's under that he's going to
[1:33:17] face a judgment trying to break that
[1:33:19] seal off of you
[1:33:24] now Ephesians 1 4 according as he hath
[1:33:28] chosen Us in him before the foundation
[1:33:31] of the world
[1:33:32] brother Brown said that means that we
[1:33:34] were we were right there with him Christ
[1:33:38] in the mind and thoughts of God before
[1:33:40] the foundation of the world that gives
[1:33:44] an eternal quality to the elect
[1:33:49] can you say Amen God's choosing us in
[1:33:53] Christ before the foundation of the
[1:33:56] world gives an eternal quality to the
[1:33:58] elect
[1:33:59] [Music]
[1:34:00] there's a lot of things about us that
[1:34:02] are full of corruption that are
[1:34:04] temporary
[1:34:05] and and it comes and it goes Trials come
[1:34:08] they go uh uh Storms Come they go mind
[1:34:11] battles come they call health comes and
[1:34:14] goes and and all of these things but
[1:34:16] there is an eternal quality to those who
[1:34:20] have their name written in that Lamb's
[1:34:22] Book of Life
[1:34:23] and he says you can't get away from that
[1:34:27] you how many tried to run from it that
[1:34:29] you can't run from it how many thought
[1:34:32] it was the end but it ain't the end
[1:34:34] ain't that right you thought I'm going
[1:34:36] down for the last time but you're still
[1:34:38] here lifting up hands praising God
[1:34:40] saying Amen to the word of God and Satan
[1:34:43] had you out he is already counting the
[1:34:45] countdown amen it was on nine amen just
[1:34:49] another word 10 that something brought
[1:34:51] you back up it's an eternal quality that
[1:34:54] you yourself can't get away from
[1:34:59] Hallelujah that's right goes on he chose
[1:35:02] us with Christ that we should be holy
[1:35:04] Without Blame before him in love having
[1:35:07] predestinated unto us unto the adoption
[1:35:10] of children by Jesus Christ to himself
[1:35:12] according to the good pleasure of his
[1:35:14] will
[1:35:15] look at that he predestinated us unto
[1:35:18] the adoption
[1:35:20] this is the age of adoption
[1:35:22] you believe that
[1:35:23] everyone's looked for this time
[1:35:26] Joshua lived it out
[1:35:28] typed it out the Israel coming into the
[1:35:31] promised land typed it out
[1:35:32] amen but here we are
[1:35:35] the very thing that we have been
[1:35:36] predestinated for we are it this is the
[1:35:40] age
[1:35:41] according to the good pleasure of his
[1:35:44] will
[1:35:46] Jesus said in John 15 16 you've not
[1:35:48] chosen me but I have chosen you
[1:35:51] if you chose yourself then it's up to
[1:35:54] you to make it
[1:35:55] but if he chose us then he's got a
[1:35:58] Ministry that he's established an agent
[1:36:01] that he has established to take us
[1:36:03] through
[1:36:05] do you believe that
[1:36:07] he eternally secured you
[1:36:11] so the Bible says God knew the end from
[1:36:14] the beginning known unto God are all of
[1:36:16] his works from the beginning
[1:36:18] so he decreed the end from the beginning
[1:36:21] so it has to be
[1:36:23] everybody say it has to be
[1:36:25] it has to be
[1:36:28] it has to be
[1:36:29] God will not lose
[1:36:32] one
[1:36:33] of his own
[1:36:35] Jesus said all that the father has given
[1:36:37] me will
[1:36:39] will come
[1:36:42] aren't you glad it's written that way
[1:36:44] he didn't say all that the father have
[1:36:46] given me I'm praying will come
[1:36:50] all that the father have given me I hope
[1:36:53] will come
[1:36:55] he just said we'll come
[1:36:59] we'll come
[1:37:00] and he didn't give a certain situation
[1:37:03] or a criteria he just said they will
[1:37:06] come
[1:37:10] he showed it by a prostitute
[1:37:14] she was one of his
[1:37:17] and now I matter how low and degraded
[1:37:19] she was she came
[1:37:22] and no matter how holy and righteous
[1:37:24] that Pharisee was there was nothing
[1:37:26] there to pull him in
[1:37:30] look at that woman that had the seven
[1:37:32] demons
[1:37:36] but she was one of his
[1:37:39] and he showed that no matter what
[1:37:41] condition you're in you're going to come
[1:37:43] everyone that has had their name written
[1:37:46] in the Lamb's Book of Life Will Come
[1:37:50] is that right John 6 39 Jesus said and
[1:37:54] this is the Father's will which hath
[1:37:56] sent me that of all which he have given
[1:37:59] me I should lose nothing
[1:38:02] but should raise it up again at the last
[1:38:05] days
[1:38:07] now we we know through in the message uh
[1:38:10] who is this Melchizedek brother Brown
[1:38:13] gives the comparison of of of course he
[1:38:16] lets us know that Melchizedek was Jesus
[1:38:20] before he became
[1:38:22] flesh
[1:38:24] he was the word
[1:38:26] body
[1:38:27] ain't that right
[1:38:29] but he also gives a comparison of us in
[1:38:33] Melchizedek us and Jesus
[1:38:35] ain't that right thank God for a prophet
[1:38:39] he gives us the comparison and we were
[1:38:42] both predestinated Jesus was
[1:38:44] predestinated you're predestinated
[1:38:47] ain't that right
[1:38:50] but we find that that he was Melchizedek
[1:38:53] in a word body before he become flesh
[1:38:56] then you never brother Brown said you
[1:38:58] never hear of Melchizedek anymore
[1:39:01] because it was Jesus
[1:39:04] in flesh
[1:39:07] but after he went uh died
[1:39:11] what did he do he went to hell he
[1:39:14] returned in a theophany
[1:39:17] a word body ain't that right now notice
[1:39:19] what brother Brown says uh he says now
[1:39:22] if this Earthly body be dissolved this
[1:39:25] this Earthly body
[1:39:28] we have another one
[1:39:31] now notice how he says this we have
[1:39:33] bypassed that
[1:39:35] what did we bypass the word body
[1:39:39] ain't that right
[1:39:41] it doesn't mean that the word that he
[1:39:44] ordained us for would never come to pass
[1:39:46] [Music]
[1:39:48] it just meant we bypassed it
[1:39:52] hello
[1:39:53] we took on a body of sin
[1:39:56] we took up on a body that's frail
[1:39:59] we took on a body that's subject to the
[1:40:02] enemy
[1:40:04] subject to discouragement subject to to
[1:40:06] whatever we come into this world
[1:40:08] speaking lies
[1:40:10] we were condemned to begin with didn't
[1:40:12] have a chance in this body
[1:40:16] ain't that right so he said see we
[1:40:19] bypassed that
[1:40:20] to come straight from God the attribute
[1:40:24] to be flesh
[1:40:26] why to be tempted everybody say to be
[1:40:29] tempted and tested by sin like Adam did
[1:40:35] seeing that too often he bought him
[1:40:37] melchized it couldn't be tempted
[1:40:41] he couldn't be tried
[1:40:44] hello
[1:40:45] God had a take on a body like you and I
[1:40:49] that word body couldn't die
[1:40:53] well we didn't come into that word body
[1:40:55] we came from Straight From God from the
[1:40:58] attribute to flesh
[1:41:01] to be tempted and tested by sin like
[1:41:04] Adam did but when testing of his word is
[1:41:08] over
[1:41:10] oh
[1:41:12] then we are taken up to this body word
[1:41:15] body theophany we that was prepared for
[1:41:19] us before the foundation of the world
[1:41:23] you realize that God didn't they are
[1:41:26] crying trying to create a body for you
[1:41:28] it has been prepared before the
[1:41:31] foundation of the world why you was
[1:41:34] already finished
[1:41:36] in God's mind he saved you he called you
[1:41:39] he ordained you he justified you he
[1:41:42] already glorified you in his mind ain't
[1:41:46] that right but when you come into this
[1:41:48] old body you didn't reflect to anything
[1:41:51] of that word
[1:41:53] hello you reflected The Works of the
[1:41:56] devil
[1:41:59] perversion
[1:42:01] ain't that right that's why Prophet said
[1:42:04] teach it you don't have to teach a child
[1:42:05] to go right or wrong if you don't even
[1:42:07] teach that child right or wrong he'll go
[1:42:09] wrong
[1:42:10] he'll just automatically go wrong
[1:42:13] amen
[1:42:15] so he says see we are taken up to this
[1:42:18] body that was prepared for us before the
[1:42:20] foundation of the world it is the word
[1:42:22] there that we skipped
[1:42:25] to come right around down here to be
[1:42:28] tempted and tested if we'd have come to
[1:42:30] that if we would have come the way
[1:42:33] through through the the word body we
[1:42:36] wouldn't have had to be tempted we would
[1:42:37] have known Temptations
[1:42:39] we wouldn't have known all these things
[1:42:41] we had known all things can you say Amen
[1:42:44] see so that's the reason Jesus knowed
[1:42:47] all things because he was the word
[1:42:48] before he was flesh then we become the
[1:42:52] word
[1:42:54] I hope you understand
[1:42:56] you're becoming the word
[1:42:58] every day you're becoming the word
[1:43:01] you're becoming the word what do you
[1:43:02] mean word every thought that God had of
[1:43:05] you is now becoming made manifest in
[1:43:07] this whole body
[1:43:09] can you say amen that's right see hear
[1:43:12] hear everybody say here we are formed to
[1:43:15] the word image
[1:43:18] that's why man when God does a job he
[1:43:20] does it right that's why there's no such
[1:43:23] thing as you keep being a sinner a
[1:43:25] sinner sinner sinner in God's eyes when
[1:43:28] he saved you he called you he sealed you
[1:43:30] in in this time you'll no longer be a
[1:43:33] sinner again
[1:43:35] he never looks at you the same way
[1:43:38] brother Brown said he doesn't look at me
[1:43:40] as a sinner he sees me through his blood
[1:43:42] he can't see me he sees he hears my
[1:43:46] voice but he sees the blood when he
[1:43:48] looks at me he sees the blood can you
[1:43:50] say Amen
[1:43:53] isn't that wonderful
[1:43:55] amen see so here we are formed to the
[1:43:58] word image that's why brother Bram said
[1:44:00] you never did it in the first place
[1:44:02] a real justification takes place
[1:44:06] you never did it in the first place and
[1:44:09] you're coming back to what you were in
[1:44:11] the first place
[1:44:14] ain't that right see so he says see we
[1:44:18] are here we are formed here we are
[1:44:20] formed to the word image to be partaker
[1:44:22] of the word no longer I was looking at
[1:44:25] the word amen but now we're being
[1:44:27] partaker of the word the word is in US
[1:44:30] we become the word
[1:44:33] ain't that right
[1:44:35] see uh be partaker of the word feed on
[1:44:38] the word by being predestinated since
[1:44:40] the beginning you see that little spark
[1:44:42] of life that you had in you from the
[1:44:44] beginning when you started your journey
[1:44:46] many of you can remember it you join
[1:44:48] this church you join that church you try
[1:44:50] this that and nothing satisfied but one
[1:44:53] day you just recognized it
[1:44:57] can you say Amen
[1:44:58] what is it it's God's Ministry
[1:45:02] [Applause]
[1:45:03] oh my you see God is established
[1:45:07] a Ministry
[1:45:09] that you don't that that his purpose
[1:45:13] isn't
[1:45:15] doesn't go unfulfilled
[1:45:18] he established a Ministry to ensure that
[1:45:20] he doesn't lose one of his own
[1:45:25] amen
[1:45:27] now we'll go on here we I believe
[1:45:31] and we talked about a little bit of it
[1:45:33] last Sunday but I believe that the
[1:45:35] angels of God are part of the ministry
[1:45:37] of God
[1:45:40] they're ministering angels as I said
[1:45:43] last Sunday they're here to encourage
[1:45:45] you
[1:45:46] they're here to help you to protect you
[1:45:49] they're here to help you believe
[1:45:54] they're here to inspire you they're here
[1:45:56] to prepare your heart
[1:45:59] what would we do
[1:46:01] without such a Ministry
[1:46:06] Abraham goes and tells Eliezer
[1:46:09] go get a wife for my son Isaac
[1:46:12] tells him don't go outside of my Kinfolk
[1:46:15] don't go anywhere you go back where I
[1:46:18] come from
[1:46:21] back where I originated from
[1:46:24] and you find a wife
[1:46:27] and get her
[1:46:29] gorselleser knew how important that was
[1:46:32] he didn't know what to do
[1:46:36] you could imagine the responsibility
[1:46:38] that he had
[1:46:40] finding that right one
[1:46:44] now we know he found the right one right
[1:46:49] and we find out that Rebecca come to the
[1:46:51] well first of all Eliezer made that
[1:46:54] prayer
[1:46:55] let the damsel that comes
[1:46:57] and offers me a drink but not only me a
[1:47:00] drink but my camels
[1:47:01] let her be the one
[1:47:04] what a prayer
[1:47:05] but now brother Brown lets us know what
[1:47:08] really happened
[1:47:10] he says it must have been the angel of
[1:47:12] God
[1:47:14] that spoke to Rebecca's heart
[1:47:17] right
[1:47:20] he said now he told us that he must have
[1:47:23] got there a half hour
[1:47:25] earlier
[1:47:27] before Ellie's or got there
[1:47:31] and spoke to Rebecca's heart and said go
[1:47:33] get the water
[1:47:35] and Rebecca came to the Water of Life at
[1:47:38] the evening time you get the picture
[1:47:40] it's the church in these last days
[1:47:43] the evening time the evening lights are
[1:47:45] here it's time that the angel of the
[1:47:47] Lord in a Supernatural is revealing
[1:47:50] himself to the Rebecca of the Bride
[1:47:53] of Isaac and somehow or another she's
[1:47:56] moved to go to the Waters of life
[1:47:59] and you say Amen
[1:48:01] see so we we find a man that that that's
[1:48:04] how Rebecca got there it was the angel
[1:48:06] of the Lord
[1:48:07] that prodded her that spoke to her
[1:48:10] and told her to go God knew who she was
[1:48:13] Eliza didn't know but God knew just like
[1:48:16] brother Branham didn't know who was
[1:48:18] bride but God knows who's bride
[1:48:21] can you say Amen now the you you know
[1:48:24] good and well that the angel of the Lord
[1:48:26] showed brother Branham that his ministry
[1:48:28] was the type of Elysia
[1:48:31] um
[1:48:33] and how would we know what was really
[1:48:35] going on how could we understand brother
[1:48:38] branham's purpose how could we
[1:48:39] understand the purpose of the message of
[1:48:42] the hour how could we understand the
[1:48:44] real intent of what is really God's
[1:48:46] purpose except the angel of God came to
[1:48:49] us and told us to go
[1:48:54] come on now amen
[1:48:56] see he says see oh my my heart is
[1:48:59] turning for Joy she's moved to go to the
[1:49:02] Waters of life he said I can hardly
[1:49:03] preach when I think of that the evening
[1:49:05] time has come the angel of the Lord is
[1:49:08] in the message
[1:49:09] Goes Forth and Woos the Rebecca to come
[1:49:12] to the Waters of life it's the moving of
[1:49:15] the supernatural
[1:49:16] ain't that right we also look it was the
[1:49:19] angels of God that showed light upon the
[1:49:22] heel to God the Shepherds to the Eternal
[1:49:24] Light the prophet said here it was the
[1:49:27] King of Kings the Lord of glories was
[1:49:29] born in a manger as a little baby and
[1:49:32] you would have thought all the Christian
[1:49:34] world Amen would have recognized it and
[1:49:36] come talking to sing and rejoice about
[1:49:39] the their coming Messiah but not one
[1:49:42] person knew that they had that that he
[1:49:45] was on the earth at that time
[1:49:48] it took the angels of God
[1:49:52] hello
[1:49:54] Prophet said he was so secretly born
[1:49:57] that no one would have known that he was
[1:49:59] on the Earth
[1:50:00] but the Angels Came to the Shepherds
[1:50:04] bring in the announcement he is on the
[1:50:08] Earth
[1:50:09] ain't that right he says the Angels
[1:50:12] themselves were lights that showed with
[1:50:14] the word of God they had the word of God
[1:50:17] and told them today in the city of David
[1:50:19] in Bethlehem is born Christ the Savior
[1:50:23] the Angels had the word amen and the the
[1:50:27] word came by light to guide them and
[1:50:30] they followed the word of the angels to
[1:50:34] Eternal Light
[1:50:35] and they found the baby there wrapped in
[1:50:38] swaddling cloth as they the Angels had
[1:50:42] said can you say Amen see so there is a
[1:50:45] Ministry of angels
[1:50:48] how many times we would miss God and
[1:50:51] what he is doing on the earth if it
[1:50:53] hadn't been for the angels of God to
[1:50:56] bring an awareness of his presence
[1:51:02] different times the prophet of God would
[1:51:04] pray for God to send the angels in the
[1:51:06] service
[1:51:08] one place said may your angels of God
[1:51:10] take their position and place this
[1:51:12] positionally Out Among the People
[1:51:15] speaking to their hearts
[1:51:17] getting them to believe
[1:51:19] take away all unbelief
[1:51:21] another place made the great angels that
[1:51:23] roll away the stone on Easter morning
[1:51:26] may they stand present today to roll
[1:51:28] away every stone of Doubt every fear and
[1:51:31] every Discord
[1:51:32] another place let the Holy Spirit that's
[1:51:34] present the spirit of the word of God
[1:51:36] that made the promise may it Sanctified
[1:51:38] these efforts that we're putting forth
[1:51:40] that when these cloths are laid upon the
[1:51:43] people or the anointing all dropped upon
[1:51:45] the sick May immediately the angels of
[1:51:48] God stand near to minister them to them
[1:51:50] the blessings of the Covenant that Jesus
[1:51:53] Christ made with the sick
[1:51:55] the Holy Spirit another place he says
[1:51:57] takes the word of God right into every
[1:52:00] heart feed Every Soul on the Manna and
[1:52:03] while these people sitting there and the
[1:52:05] angels of God and can't about them
[1:52:07] notice Satan is sitting near them saying
[1:52:11] don't you do it don't you do it see and
[1:52:14] the angel is saying but this is your
[1:52:16] time father they had to make it a
[1:52:19] decision amen he had already made the
[1:52:21] altar call him people had raised their
[1:52:22] hands amen but he saw the battle that
[1:52:25] was raging in the in the audience there
[1:52:27] was the Demons of Satan the Ministers of
[1:52:30] Satan standing there telling the people

[1:52:36] of time young people amen don't you give
[1:52:38] away amen from your walk away from your
[1:52:40] denomination but then there was another
[1:52:42] Minister a angel of God that would stand
[1:52:46] there and say but it's your time it's
[1:52:48] your time raise your hand the mercy of
[1:52:51] God is with you can you say amen amen a
[1:52:54] minister can preach the word of God and
[1:52:57] I thank God that there's Angels Amen in
[1:52:59] this building today amen that'll sit

[1:53:21] they had to do something about it they
[1:53:22] had to say yes Satan I'll go with you or
[1:53:25] God I'll take you
[1:53:27] that decision Still Remains with us
[1:53:29] can you say Amen
[1:53:31] and every one of us fights that's where
[1:53:33] the battles of our mind goes every one
[1:53:35] of us fights it every every negative
[1:53:38] Spirit every negative thought every
[1:53:40] negative thing comes from the Devil

[1:53:48] ministers and they stand beside us and
[1:53:52] they try to get us to do wrong they try
[1:53:54] to get us to do whatever they try to
[1:53:55] just get us to disbelieve the word of
[1:53:57] God they try to get us to do what
[1:54:00] everybody else is doing and put exalt
[1:54:02] science and exalt achievements and exalt
[1:54:04] everything else above the word of God

[1:54:19] of Christ amen there's something there
[1:54:22] that God ministers To Us by his angels

[1:54:35] positions stands close
[1:54:37] it's close isn't it
[1:54:40] Satan is Raging
[1:54:42] unbelief is trying to settle in on the
[1:54:45] people

[1:54:49] are at their position
[1:54:51] they're standing ready
[1:54:53] even the either the black flags will

[1:55:14] is that you are your mind is the
[1:55:16] Battleground ain't that right amen

[1:55:22] foreign
[1:55:25] amen you'll either listen to the devil

[1:55:46] do amen you're following something that
[1:55:49] may be angels of God stand by every one
[1:55:52] of us to inspire that word and to keep
[1:55:54] it inspired in our hearts
[1:55:57] [Music]
[1:55:59] listen to the message today early this
[1:56:02] morning I couldn't go sleep
[1:56:03] I woke up about two couldn't sleep I
[1:56:06] find just decide to listen to a message
[1:56:07] and I
[1:56:09] Graham at the closing of the sermon
[1:56:12] he told him he says see
[1:56:16] as many of you thinking you're lost
[1:56:19] paraphrasing
[1:56:21] he asked him he said how many wants to
[1:56:22] go in a rapture
[1:56:25] apparently the people raise their hand
[1:56:26] he says see that just tells you right
[1:56:28] there
[1:56:28] you're not lost
[1:56:30] you're not Eternal lost because there's
[1:56:32] something in you still calling for you
[1:56:35] come up
[1:56:37] the moment you say you quit it's over
[1:56:39] it's done
[1:56:41] and there's nothing there to draw you
[1:56:42] anymore that's when you're in bad shape
[1:56:44] but May the angels of God
[1:56:46] keep ministering the word to us
[1:56:49] can you say man
[1:56:51] amen see the Bible tells us that the
[1:56:53] angels of God are with the believer
[1:56:55] they are always there the prophet said
[1:56:58] and they never leave
[1:57:00] they are always there they never leave
[1:57:02] ain't that right Amen in speaking of
[1:57:05] Moses going down to Egypt brother
[1:57:07] Branham said he didn't have any Warriors
[1:57:09] any no chariots to back him up as far as
[1:57:12] the world knew amen see he was alone
[1:57:15] God's asking him to do a a job that was
[1:57:18] totally impossible and he asked every
[1:57:21] one of us to do that same thing amen
[1:57:23] many times you're doing the will of God
[1:57:25] as his Minister and you're standing
[1:57:28] alone
[1:57:29] how many's ever felt that where you're
[1:57:32] just standing alone we hear God Amen he
[1:57:34] didn't give him a supply him with an
[1:57:37] Army in the natural he didn't Supply him
[1:57:39] with Brothers to say Moses you can do it
[1:57:42] let's go I got you back he didn't Supply
[1:57:44] him with nothing he was there with a
[1:57:46] crooked stick his wife and child on the
[1:57:49] cow on the on the mule and he was there
[1:57:51] a one-man Invasion amen but the prophet
[1:57:55] said see he didn't have any Warriors No
[1:57:57] chariots to back him up as far as the
[1:57:59] world knew see but he had come face to
[1:58:02] face with god with an experience who had
[1:58:06] the armored of Angels the armored angels
[1:58:09] of all the eternities to stand by so
[1:58:12] then then Moses was not alone was he
[1:58:15] Amen to the Natural he looked alone Amen
[1:58:18] in the natural he looked like he was
[1:58:20] standing and it was out by himself and
[1:58:22] it was hopeless it was a hopeless case
[1:58:24] amen but he knew by a supernatural
[1:58:27] experience with God that God would have
[1:58:29] him Ministry of angels amen and they
[1:58:32] were all around him amen how else did
[1:58:35] the plagues come it was angels that made
[1:58:37] that happen how else was the water
[1:58:39] turned to blood there was an angel that
[1:58:41] made that happen it wasn't now Moses a
[1:58:43] man standing there it was God's Ministry
[1:58:47] of angels making every word of Moses
[1:58:50] come to pass
[1:58:54] Hallelujah
[1:58:55] that's right
[1:58:57] he said as Moses went down with his wife
[1:59:01] straddled on a little mule
[1:59:03] along Whiskers Whiskers hanging down
[1:59:06] he said I believe that Ten Thousand
[1:59:08] Times Ten thousands of angels rode along
[1:59:12] down those dusted robes with him
[1:59:16] Hallelujah
[1:59:18] you know
[1:59:20] they're in Acts 7 35
[1:59:22] it tells us that God sent Moses to be a
[1:59:25] ruler and a deliverer by the hand of the
[1:59:30] angel
[1:59:31] which appeared to him in the bush
[1:59:34] can you say Amen now there are people
[1:59:37] that don't believe in angels they don't
[1:59:39] believe in the ministry of angels
[1:59:41] especially since the Holy Ghost has come
[1:59:43] ain't that right but angels are real and
[1:59:46] they are everyone at God's command do
[1:59:50] you believe that they are at God's
[1:59:52] command what was it then that caused the
[1:59:54] flood Amen brother Branham asked the
[1:59:56] question what was it that broke up The
[1:59:58] Fountains of the deep he said it was the
[2:00:00] angel of God called wormwood amen he's
[2:00:03] the one that angel has control of all of
[2:00:06] all the Waters of all the fountains and
[2:00:09] God would put that angel as a minister
[2:00:11] here was his servant preaching with no
[2:00:14] Vindication Amen to a proof to the
[2:00:16] people but he was preaching what had
[2:00:18] been a revelation to him that God was
[2:00:21] going to send a flood it was impossible
[2:00:23] amen for Noah to bring on a flood but he
[2:00:26] preached it anyways he was dependent
[2:00:28] upon the Supernatural and God Amen would
[2:00:32] send the ministry of an angel that would
[2:00:34] come in a supernatural way amen and
[2:00:37] break up The Fountains of the diva and
[2:00:39] sin the flood just as Moses or Noah had
[2:00:42] declared it would happen
[2:00:49] there's a lot of things that's been
[2:00:51] declared by the church that's
[2:00:53] we've declared it's going to happen
[2:00:57] how is the rapture going to take place
[2:00:59] how's the changing of our bodies going
[2:01:00] to happen
[2:01:02] how are we going to be caught up
[2:01:05] we preached it
[2:01:07] we've ministered we've labored
[2:01:11] but you know what
[2:01:14] brother Raymond talked about them UFOs
[2:01:16] that'd keep appearing
[2:01:19] one appeared the other day
[2:01:21] and caught on the news
[2:01:23] the real brand and the world don't know
[2:01:25] what they are
[2:01:27] they said they'll be there and disappear
[2:01:28] just like that
[2:01:30] how the clear blue and it's been a a
[2:01:33] phenomenon they it's a mystery to them
[2:01:35] that they they don't know and it's got
[2:01:37] the world scared but God would send a
[2:01:40] prophet that would tell us don't you
[2:01:41] worry about them them are angels they're
[2:01:44] investigating angels and he said one of
[2:01:46] these days they're coming to take us
[2:01:47] home amen I know how the Rapture is
[2:01:49] coming I know how it's going to be
[2:01:51] there's a Ministry of angels there is a
[2:01:53] supernatural power them angels that are
[2:01:55] with us today amen that are watching
[2:01:58] over you that are watching looking at
[2:01:59] the sin and the filth of this world
[2:02:01] they've got the power Amen to raise you
[2:02:03] up
[2:02:06] amen and you say man
[2:02:11] you love him
[2:02:13] so I thank God for the ministry of
[2:02:15] angels
[2:02:17] some teach that we because we have the
[2:02:19] Holy Ghost God doesn't use them but we
[2:02:21] find out after the day of Pentecost that
[2:02:23] Angels appeared to people
[2:02:25] it was the angel of the Lord that loosed
[2:02:27] the shackles off of Peter while he was
[2:02:29] in prison
[2:02:30] and open the door so he could walk out
[2:02:32] of prison
[2:02:35] is the Angel of the Lord that that that
[2:02:37] made them guard sleep so well that they
[2:02:40] couldn't hear what was going on
[2:02:43] can you say man it was the angel of the
[2:02:45] Lord that spake unto Philip amen and
[2:02:48] told him to arise and go a certain place
[2:02:50] or go a certain direction as he went he
[2:02:52] met the the the uh Ethiopian amen and
[2:02:56] and talk to him about the Lord baptized
[2:02:58] him it was the angel of the Lord that
[2:03:00] done that why it was a Ministry of
[2:03:03] angels Philip didn't know about that
[2:03:05] Ethiopian but God knew about that
[2:03:07] Ethiopian
[2:03:10] can you say man
[2:03:12] it was the angel of the Lord that told
[2:03:14] Peter of Cornelius
[2:03:17] ain't that right amen the Bible tells us
[2:03:20] that Cornelius received a warning from
[2:03:22] God by an Holy Angel to send for Peter
[2:03:26] amen so is the Angel of the Lord that
[2:03:28] got him together Peter would have never
[2:03:31] accepted Cornelius or anything him being
[2:03:33] a gentile but God would send an angel to
[2:03:36] forewarn him that that man needed his
[2:03:39] his ministry
[2:03:41] that he was not to reject Cornelius but
[2:03:44] he would follow was to follow and preach
[2:03:46] the gospel to him
[2:03:47] and as he preached the gospel every one
[2:03:50] of them were filled with the Holy Ghost
[2:03:55] it was the ministry of an Angel
[2:03:58] in Acts 27 22 Paul there he was
[2:04:03] said I go Bound in Jerusalem or go bound
[2:04:07] uh well he was being taken to Rome I
[2:04:10] think it was
[2:04:12] to be tried
[2:04:15] there they were on the ship
[2:04:16] you all know the story
[2:04:19] then the Storm come they've been there
[2:04:21] for many days the ship are rocking it
[2:04:23] was starting to sink
[2:04:25] they were throwing things out of the
[2:04:26] ship that wasn't helping ain't that
[2:04:28] right amen the dark clouds could you
[2:04:30] imagine being in the in the ocean in all
[2:04:33] them waves huge ways and it was
[2:04:35] collapsing the ship
[2:04:36] amen but here in Acts 27 22 Paul says I
[2:04:40] exhort you he's talking about every
[2:04:42] seller he wasn't even a sailor but he
[2:04:44] was talking to the captain he was
[2:04:45] talking to him all I exhort you to be of
[2:04:48] good cheer in the middle of the storm
[2:04:50] when it was all Bleak Bros Sam and no no
[2:04:53] no chance of hope they were all going to
[2:04:56] drown but here was a man standing there
[2:04:58] and saying but be of good cheer amen for
[2:05:00] there shall not be no loss of any man's
[2:05:03] life among you but of this ship for
[2:05:05] there stood by me this night the angel
[2:05:08] of God
[2:05:10] oh my I'm so glad that the angels of God
[2:05:13] still come to us Amen in the very trials
[2:05:17] when we look like it ain't going to
[2:05:18] happen and it looks like we're going to
[2:05:20] be destroyed it looks like Satan's going
[2:05:22] to have his way and be able to carry out
[2:05:24] his thread the angel of God begins to
[2:05:27] tell us it ain't going to happen Don't
[2:05:29] Be Afraid don't be a feared amen don't
[2:05:32] worry be at rest for you're going to
[2:05:35] make it can you say man amen have you
[2:05:38] heard that speak to your heart amen as
[2:05:40] as in and it may be days and it may be
[2:05:42] months it may be years of long trial
[2:05:45] amen but there's something that's inside
[2:05:47] of you that says it's going to be all
[2:05:49] right something's going to happen amen
[2:05:51] George coming in the morning well this
[2:05:54] is where Paul was he could stand there
[2:05:56] and declare the word of the Lord by an
[2:05:59] Angel
[2:06:01] thank you
[2:06:03] that is true for there stood by me this
[2:06:06] night the angel of God whose I am and
[2:06:08] whom I serve
[2:06:10] saying fear not Paul
[2:06:12] thou must be brought before Caesar
[2:06:15] and lo God hath given thee all them that
[2:06:18] sell with thee
[2:06:20] can you say Amen
[2:06:22] so see it's the ministry of angels
[2:06:25] that come to make sure that God's word
[2:06:29] don't fail
[2:06:32] he says and remember
[2:06:33] with the Bible here before me is it true
[2:06:36] that this power is given only for
[2:06:39] healing see I pray for the people they
[2:06:42] go away and if they believe they get
[2:06:44] well
[2:06:45] if that faith that prayer is said for
[2:06:47] that person and if they believe it watch
[2:06:51] if that if if that if that faith that
[2:06:54] prayer is said for that person and if
[2:06:57] they believe it the angels of God will
[2:07:00] watch over that person
[2:07:02] they have to get well maybe not that
[2:07:04] hour maybe not that week maybe not that
[2:07:08] month it may be six weeks before they
[2:07:10] get well or what before their well but
[2:07:13] they will get well they've got to get
[2:07:15] well can you say man why there's a
[2:07:18] Ministry of angels you're not alone
[2:07:20] think of that now when you come to a
[2:07:22] prayer line and when you get prayed for
[2:07:24] amen and it's a prayer Faith it's a
[2:07:27] faith that has responded to that prayer
[2:07:29] and you begin to thank God Amen all of a
[2:07:32] sudden the Angels stand to attention and
[2:07:34] they are given charge over you
[2:07:37] hello they're given charge by God to
[2:07:40] watch over you and they're with you
[2:07:42] every day of your life they are with you
[2:07:44] to make sure you get your healing
[2:07:49] [Applause]
[2:07:51] and we don't believe in the worship of
[2:07:53] angels but we believe in the ministry of
[2:07:55] angels
[2:07:56] brother Brown said if you don't believe
[2:07:57] angels are ministering Spirits sent from
[2:07:59] the presence of God then you don't know
[2:08:01] your Bible

[2:09:08] say Amen we're not worshiping the
[2:09:10] seventh angel we're not worshiping a man
[2:09:12] we're not feeding off of a man we're
[2:09:14] feeding off the unfailing body where
[2:09:16] word of the son of man that was sent to
[2:09:18] us by an Angel
[2:09:21] amen
[2:09:24] you're not believing on a man

[2:09:43] that God has set and established
[2:09:46] to carry out his purpose
[2:09:48] his will
[2:09:51] amen isn't the Lord wonderful
[2:09:54] to think
[2:09:57] what's holding back the powers the winds
[2:10:01] what's holding back the Four Winds
[2:10:04] the Bible talks about the Four Winds
[2:10:08] brother Brandon said wins mean War
[2:10:11] and what was it the second World War
[2:10:14] first World War
[2:10:16] it almost become
[2:10:18] a whole
[2:10:20] destruction of the world
[2:10:24] everything was going on so strong
[2:10:26] but there was a promise in the word
[2:10:30] that said to the Four Winds holds
[2:10:33] them Angels hold them back
[2:10:37] ain't that right
[2:10:38] Brahm so that was fulfilled in the first
[2:10:40] World War
[2:10:42] no one knows what stopped it
[2:10:45] no one knows what happened
[2:10:47] but he told us what was happening there
[2:10:49] was angels
[2:10:50] that was holding him back
[2:10:53] now you think of that why because
[2:10:55] there's some people that had to be
[2:10:56] sealed
[2:10:57] [Music]
[2:10:59] there was a message that had to come
[2:11:03] to give rapturing Faith to a people
[2:11:06] ain't that right
