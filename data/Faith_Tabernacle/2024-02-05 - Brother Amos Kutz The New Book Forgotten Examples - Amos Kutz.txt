you won't find that fossil that sin isn't left there as a fossil it's annihilated out of existence amen amen amen he can't take down that's impossible to find that one it's been deleted amen the only fishing that can be done there to find it is in your mind and Satan knows that uh very very well so good to see everybody out this evening amen and all that have uh put into the service this evening we really appreciate it good to see our sister back up here with the base fiddle amen missed it this morning but I'm sure there was a reason for not being there and it's good to have brother Chris with us amen I uh would have liked to have heard him sing but uh uh how wants to hear him sing sometime again soon amen praise the Lord I really like the way he sings and puts his heart into it and he drives a long ways and he's going to uh uh the school there at Liberty University and uh he certainly I'm sure he appreciates our prayers for him while he's there and that the Lord will help him to uh accomplish the uh goal and the uh objective that he has for his life the Lord will lead him and direct him amen Bible says the footsteps of the righteous are ordered of the Lord I guess if I was going to become a nurse or a doctor I would have to take the requirements to in order to become that amen and praise the Lord I believe that we are on the right Road tonight don't you amen amen we I won't keep you standing um so it's good to be able to share with you I certainly enjoy brother Terry's uh service this morning and um things he said there on Israel I wrote down a bunch of things uh that uh I'll have to talk to him about not that I was disagreeing with him or anything like that but I just uh it was it was just something there's a lot a lot there and maybe sometime brother ter will pre preaches a whole bunch of stuff on Israel and the history of the Jews in the last 2,000 years uh it's one people that exists today very very few others exist you know you speak to I speak about the Assyrians they're actually still in existence believe it or not but they're no longer that mighty nation that they once were and I often and wonder why they still exist and I wonder just a thought but you know God actually sent the Assyrians Jonah something think about that they were the most wickedest cruelest people that came against Israel and they were very warlike they mistreated their enemies they were very Wicked evil people for their time and uh I spoke on it one time here at the church but there was something in the Bible where one of their generals came down there and mocked the people of God I believe it was uh one of the Kings there in the city and he mocked him and then what he was saying was there was a lot of Truth in what he was saying that they had destroyed many of the other nations and that was a fact and of course it was a lot of flattery and that and so forth but thanks be to God the king believed the report of the Lord and even though he was frightened and shaken knowing that this man and his army had done thus and thus but he was facing a different group of people this time he was facing God's people amen so I'm not going to be speaking on that tonight but there were certainly a lot of things that brother Terry brought out there about the Jews and their current history uh ongoing history and history in the making um praise the Lord so this evening I want you to turn with me to the book of Isaiah 65 I thought I would read this because it uh really deals somewhat with the subject of what I like to speak on tonight Isaiah 65 beginning at verse 17 and we're going to read on down to uh verse 23 and uh I want you to take notice to some of these verses that uh uh point to a a new type of living a new type of living of course you know well say brother Amos you know new Heavens A New Earth uh that's going to be a new type of living but I want you to notice there's going to be some things absent amen amen Isaiah 65:1 17 for behold I create new heavens and a new Earth that the former shall not be remembered I want you to notice that and I want you to write that I want you to let that soak into your mind from one end of between these both ears up and down every which way I want you to remember that and the former shall not be remembered nor come into mind Verse 18 but be ye glad and rejoice forever in that which I create for behold I create Jerusalem a more of a dead Church no a rejoicing and her people a joy I Will Rejoice now this is the Lord speaking through the prophet Isaiah here in verse 19 and I will rejoice in Jerusalem and joy in my people and the voice of weeping shall be no more heard in her nor the voice of the crying there shall be no more then an infant of days in other words a young child comes to an untimely death no more then in infinite days nor an old man hath not filled his days for the child should die in 100 years old The Sinner being 100 years old shall be accursed he said nor an old man that hath not filled his days an untimely an untimely death and they shall build houses and inhabit them amen plant Vineyards and eat the fruit of them they shall not build another inhabit they shall not plant and another eat for as the days of a tree are the days of my people and mine elect shall long enjoy the work of their hands they shall not labor in vain nor bring forth for trouble for they are the seed of the Blessed of the Lord and their offspring with them amen I'd also like you to turn over to the book of uh Hebrews chapter 8 and verse 12 and I will be reading three verses there and then we'll go to Hebrews 9 and 14 and then Hebrews 10 and read three verses there he says for I will be merciful to their unrighteousness and their sins and iniquities I will remember no more Hebrews 9 and12 neither by the blood of goats and calves but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy Place having obtained Eternal Redemption for us for if the blood of bulls and of goats and the ashes of an hepher sprinkling the unclean sanctifying sanctify to the purifying of the flesh how much more shall the blood of Christ who through the eternal spirit offered himself without spot to God Purge your conscience from dead Works to serve the Living God Hebrews 10:1 for the law having a shadow of good things to come and not the very image of the things can never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually make the comers there unto perfect for then would they not have ceased to be offered because that the worshippers once purged should have had no more Consciousness should have no more conscience of sins but in those sacrifices there is Remembrance again made of sins every year no more conscience of sins I want to speak to you tonight on the the the subject of the new book and subtitling it forgotten examples forgotten examples you can be seated Lord Jesus we just bow our heads and our hearts Lord don't open this W book as we've already read we pray you would bless these things that you've laid upon our heart in Jesus Christ name amen amen the new book forgotten examples we how many of us tonight we believe that's God's word we believe it it's absolutely God's word to us amen now now we we realize here in Jeremiah which Hebrews 8 and12 was merely Paul was repeating what Jeremiah said in 31 and 34 and they shall teach no more every man his neighbor and every man his brother saying know the Lord for they shall all know me from the least of them unto the greatest of them sayeth the Lord for I will forgive their iniquity and I will remember there sin no more amen now uh I would like you to turn with me and I think what we'll do is uh we'll go right to that I believe will be a help to us tonight the Lord will help us amen amen he says here Hebrews 11:1 now Faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of Things Not Seen and then jump down to Hebrews 11 and5 by faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death and was not found because God had translated him for before his translation he had this testimony that he pleased God am and then we read this in following in the verse six Paul says but without faith it is impossible to please him for he that cometh to God must believe that he is he's a rewarder of them that diligently seek him now how many believes tonight that you are absolutely a child of God and that all your previous sins prior to your conversion prior to your new birth are no longer in existence you've got to believe that amen I don't know that there's one person in here tonight including myself or anyone else for that fact that's ever stood behind this Pulpit or sat in his pews could say that their sins have not been dealt with if they've claimed to be a Christian I believe with all my heart what the word says about me now there is every person that has walked in this building as I said with the past and I'm not even trying to dig that up because I don't have the nature and the desire to dig up people's past unless they're hiding something unless they claim something that they don't possess and I say to that person come clean this Pulpit is designed for one thing it's so that the book of Our Lives if we're not Christians is that our book of our life to be opened and that the Lord says when that book is open come now let us reason together sayeth the Lord though your sins be as Scarlet though they be red as Crimson they shall be white as snow white as wool this is not a place of condemnation this is not a building where we preach people into hell we preach people to a Reconciliation and a recognization that without Christ you're lost without the manifestation the revealing of the Redemption plan to your heart and soul and that you make a decision you're sick the Bible says judgment must first begin at the house of the Lord now that's what this place is yeah this is a place of Correction it's a place it's also a birthing place this is where the the the uh where the word is sown the seed is sown it's also where it's conceived and it's also where it's birthed Hallelujah aren't you thankful for a House of Mercy aren't you thankful we're not looking for judgment the Bible says that we're pass from Death un life amen we're no longer living out under the dread fear of fatalism to think that our Doom is somewhere down the road and if you are living like that that's nothing that's what the devil wants you to live he wants you to live in fear and torment God wants you to have absolute peace he wants you to have a new life but there's a sin problem that's got to be dealt with and we know that that's what he is here to do for us is to change our lives to change our souls to take away the old man now we we come from all different backgrounds brother brandham made this statement so many times I think the last time I spoke was up there in Pennsylvania and and brother Rand made this statement so many times that since the opening of those seals the Bible has become a new book now I'm going to make a statement tonight I've made these statements and people will think oh my maybe he's preaching false Doctrine or he's and it is your right to uh make sure I pray for the hand of God of Correction I don't stand up here without uh a possibility of not committing an error making a mistake that is not my intent to be wrong my intent is to bring forth the word not put my own interpretation to it but now based upon what the word says about us now if this thing is retroactive I'm maybe moving ahead a little bit further than faster than what uh I want it to right now but if this thing is retroactive all the way back to the Garden of Eden then I can tell you in this book there's a written record but I want you to know in God's book there is no written record of Eve's fall or Adam's fall now i r read to you that is your sins is cast into the sea of his forgetfulness I read he said your sins and iniquities I will remember no more now if it's only good for us today then he's not the same yesterday today and forever that's why the prophet said it's a new book you read it with a revelation of this message now Adam was down there in Paradise he was there Samson was there David was there Elijah was there or Elisha it was when Saul King Saul called for him that time but look at all the situations that all the Old Testament Saints the situations you read about the errors they committed you know and and how they some of them were quite uh I'm looking for the right word for but some of them were really really bad they were really wicked what it was it was the enemy who was moving on them and they different personalities that's why many of these things and I'm so glad that there is a masterpiece that'll fit every puzzle of your life I don't really say that in the context of brother Brandon preaching the Masterpiece but I found that quote just recently within that sermon take master and peace and separate him there's a master key that'll open every lock and there's a masterpiece that'll fit every situation of any life there is a master blood that'll take care of any sin problem that a person might have it's a master blood it'll fit whatever the conflict is whatever the sin is it'll remove it and there is a fire that will destroy the old man and not just live in a state of divorcement but where the old man dies and the new man in Christ Jesus resurrected the soul is elevated without the sin nature because the sin nature of the old man is eliminated now do we or do we not believe the quotes and the scriptures do we or do we [Laughter] not as long as I am in this body and mind it's going to be a battle but it's not going to be a defeating battle it's going to be a battle that's going to lead me stronger and more res res Resolute in my faith cuz though Abraham got older and older and older and I just read tonight something that I did not know about Abraham he was sterile and Eve not Eve but Sarah was also a baron so both of them had an issue uh I've read this quote and I want to I want you to be able to hear what the prophet says about it you just pardon me a minute while I find it up here brother brand made some some amazing statements about Abraham and Sarah in this message you know I've got something to back this up I'm not just saying this or making it up brother brandham in 1958 in April the 6th I know my redeemer liveth brother Bram says this he says how it was an assurance to Abraham after he had found God and know that God had a purpose that in his purpose he was going to bring through Abraham and Sarah a son okay and through this son Isaac was going to come the Lord Jesus and in this purpose he was bringing for Sarah and Abraham okay and was going to make them a great people oh yeah everybody whoa yeah yeah praise God and bring this son and then brother Rand just kind of stops and his the spirit leads him to say these words he says and bring this son dot dot dot taking the very worst persons that could be to do it with did you hear what I just read to you we we somehow because of the great fact you know Abraham stag not the pro of God and that's true but we also forget he lied he misrepresented his wife as his sister because he had fear fear was ruling on the throne of his heart temporarily he had issues and and there were several other things I think that happened there look at Sarah we put them up on pedestals but you know what and this is I take consolation in this because I realize these were people oh they didn't come from a long line of a long family Legacy that goes way back you know and how people say oh I could trace my roots back to this certain king of this Castle over there in Europe or something like that like I'm supposed to be impressed I had a fell to telling me always he said found out my last name I won't tell you what the last name was but he said I found out it was related my great great great great this was this some great sea captain and boy he was blowing it off and I thought well I better not say and you see we we put Abraham and Sarah on that because why you know and they bu you know make these statu using and so forth and it the sculptor will or the artist will try to paint a picture of an image of what they think Abraham would look like but you know what if you could really see the image of Abraham it probably would not be that impressive because if God ever he says God takes the nothings and I'll read it to you God likes to take something that isn't nothing and make something out of it does that I I don't know about you but I feel I'm a nothing I was absolutely a nothing I tend to compare myself with others many times I know God has created individuality you're you brother Tim as an individual and are you brother Bill sister sister sister and brother you're all individuals we're all important to God but yet we're nobody's we're lost whether you be king or poer makes no difference whether you be president or the guy that is janitor we're all in the same both together in need of a savior little there is no such thing as a good good boy sinner they're all bad Sinners all have sin and come short of the glory of God sorry you don't measure up hate to bust your bubble oh by the time we get done night I might think well I thought I was such a pretty good guy till brother Amos just burst my bubble well I got mind burst and I want to keep it burst anything good that be said about me because I surrendered to the Lord and it's all because of him anyway it's all because of his Mercy I wasn't seeking God he was seeking me he was seeking you I didn't really care at one time about God I didn't really have a concern but one day the Holy Spirit begin to deal with my heart and I thank God amen that I had that dealing I thank God that he persisted and he didn't walk away from me amen I thank God he didn't give up on me why because I believe now I believe that I was part of him Hallelujah but then you couldn't have told me I was matter of fact I went through stages in my life where I thought I could be lost now that's the ignorance of the word that's why we needed a message Amen to tell us that once you're a part of his sheep you weren't you didn't become a sheep you always were a sheep we we needed a message to tell us these things that's right he said that's he said make something out of it he's a Creator that's why he took you and I we were nothing that he might make children of of his own out of us who were wretched and miserable and lost and blind and lovely to make us his lovely children it's God's purpose to do so and then again it looked like God would have taken a young woman and a young man to have done this a young woman young man who just been married he would have said now you have no children I'm going to have you your firstborn your first son to be a born and he's going to be my Isaac but God chose a man 75 years old and a woman's 65 10 years difference to do his purpose to show that you can be both young or old God can still and will work out his purpose certainly I go on to say more about that and I've got a little bit more on that quote but now we have a written record and here in the book of Corinthians uh see if I can find that real quickly where Paul makes mention of this in 1 Corinthians chapter 10 we read this 1 Corinthians chapter 10 and verse one I'll just read back up there and we'll read through this you all have it say Amen 1 Corinthians 10:1 moreover Brethren and would not that you would be ignorant how that all F how that all our fathers were under the cloud and all passed through the sea and were all baptized un Moses in the cloud and in the sea did all eat the same spiritual meat and did all drink the same spiritual drink for they drank of that spiritual rock that followed them and that rock was Christ now notice what he says here in 1 Corinthians 10 and 5 but with many of them God was not well pleased he was not well pleased what does it say in Hebrews without faith it's impossible to please him so what happened here there was a lack of faith matter of fact it was unbelief that went on display so God was not well pleased for they were over thrown in the wilderness and then he says in verse six now these things were our examples to the intent we should not lust after evil things as they also lusted I want to stop right here and say one thing those people had an open book their sin was called to be reckoned upon their sin they were called upon to believe what they had in their heart was Faith to start with but then they allowed unbelief to come in and because of that they were overthrown in the wilderness they lost their position now I don't know about you but brother Terry mentioned that this morning and every time I've heard this I don't know about you here you had a generation that came out of Egypt that seen most Moses performed these signs seeing Egyptians die left and right cattle what have you Liv stock Grievious things happened upon Egypt and they put the blood over the doorpost some of these very same people and they left their bondages and God mightily delivers through the opening of the Red Sea and they see all these things and then they begin to murmur and complain and finally God says I've had enough imagine that generation think about the fact that some of the very ones that were down there slaving away in Egypt was praying for deliverance and then the Deliverance comes and then they walk with the deliverance and at some point they begin to disbelieve and finally God says that is it they cross the line here is a nation that God has put fear into the hearts of all the nations around and the word gets out what happened to Egypt and how the Red Sea opened up and swallowed up pharaoh and his CHS these very people who participate not spectators but participated in the Deliverance or overthrown because of their unbelief and let's take that a step further now I'll be honest with you this is really heavy what I'm about to say but you know the Pharisees came up and said to Jesus our father's in the wilderness and Jesus turned to him and said and then they are everyone dead now the prophet tells us when Jesus said that they weren't just dead in the grave they were dead in sins and trespasses and had gone beyond the veil of this life into death into another dimension to where there was no salvation for them can you imagine can you imagine I can't but at the white Throne judgment when these Jews come up before the throne and they're lost nearly 2 million and just a handful that we know of went in in to the promised land and they had to stand there and they see the Lord your God Deuteronomy 18:15 sitting there on the throne fulfilled the judge yeah have a lot to answer for and that Canaanite tribe who was probably at one time walked with God because many of those Canaanite tribes were actually sons of Abraham didn't know that did you that's right many of those Heathen tribes that dwelt in Canaan some of them were actually descendants of the sons of Abraham they know that when you study you study these things that's why the Bible said the iniquity of the amorites was not yet full see God God was being merciful he says I won't bring judgment on them but when they cross that line then the iniquity of the amorites will be full I gave them chance to repent and these were no doubt people at one time they were fervent Believers of Jehovah God though they were not of Isaac's line they were not the promised son but they were given opportunity to walk in the light of Abraham and they wandered away and begin to worship other Gods God gave said I'll do away with that group they're cursed and I'll give their land to my people God has a reason for the things that he has people to do you see we even even today that's that's a tough one for me to swallow is the fact that God told them to slay all of them now if it's up to me I'd be trying to give people show people Mercy I'm glad I didn't live in that hour when I believe God would have helped me but there's one thing about it God had a reason for that he don't he don't take a man to that kind of judgment unless he's actually warn them see that's what the opening of the seals is CA us we have the mind of Christ now we're beginning to understand these things that's right who would have ever thought and I mentioned here in this group of people still on the Earth today and they know their background they know where they come from as far as their spiritual condition is concerned that's another question but the Assyrians they still claim an Assyrian Nation they were nearly wiped out by the Arab population back in the 1900s and a British general who had the British army was all over the world in Middle East at that time came to the rescue and spared them from Annihilation now that's to me that's a wonder you know brother Rand the Bible said Jesus said at the day of judgment the men of Neva will raise up and condemn this generation you don't find anywhere any of the prophets outside of Jonah if you can find one go ahead and give it to me you cannot find one place where it was ever promised during the old under the Old Testament that was ever prophesied that God was going to show Mercy to a group of people called the nites you can't find it it's only when God raised up a man called Jonah a Jewish Prophet to go to a wicked Heathen City and preach a message now who can know the mind of God here you have Israel you know the Babylonian captivity all this was to come later on if I understand the timeline correctly I but Nineveh takes place before the Babylonian cap captivity if I've got it right but anyway you don't find it nowhere that's why I say who can know the mind of God some things God just don't tell His prophets he never told Moses and someday there's going to be in a ey he could have but we don't read it anywhere so it's silent but where God had a secret that he kept from even his own people because there was somebody down there was going to be people born and to me this is so staggering this is why this message is just opening up more and more and more in having the mind of Christ you you're seeing the way God thinks this is God's thinking on this play this message is God's thinking on display and when you have that Supernatural spirit of God in you then all this starts to Dove tail together and you can see God giving Mercy not just the nites but the jebusites they lied you know that they lied to Joshua now what what what what happened when people lie to God's people pretty serious consequences ain't and here these jeps sites they were found mercy and they become wood cutters and according to what some sources say the jebusites served the Lord for Generation after generation even when Israel itself God's people backslid the jebusites stood with Jehovah this Bible is a new book history is being Rewritten I have said this time and time again brother and sister we didn't really know what just the just being justified what was all about the Prophet came to tell us you didn't do it in the first place that's where you're at you say well I yeah but I actually did you may actually have thought of yes we did but in God's mind it's gone it is absolutely gone there's no fossil bed there's not going to be any archaological digs that's going to be able to dig up your past your past could be in every Courthouse across the United States that's true books even written about you the henus person that you were like lady mcabe yeah but as far as God's dictionary God's encyclopedia God's history book it's not even there if God be for you who can be against you they find these things over in Siberia massive amounts of Buffalo I believe it was or mastadons herds of them in these Mass Graves and it looks like some of them display such like some gigantic Force literally picked these huge creatures and threw them up against a rock wall with injuries to their legs that could not have happened unless there had been some sort of catastrophic disaster scientists don't know what that is they find these things Frozen in the ice they're com constantly finding things the Chinese have an underground traffic of these ivories that taken from these mastadons where they're washing out of the seashores on the Arctic Ocean falling out of the banks they make that stuff and send it down to China where they make sculptures out of it a mute testimony but I'll tell you what as sins of a Believer your neighbor he but I say this you made restitution some of you had to come out and confess some of the awfulest things in your life and in my life and I tell you what if I'd pass this microphone around right now who want to talk about their past life I don't want to even resurrected but you know Paul did but he did for an example First Corinthians why why do we read about why do we read about Samson and his mistakes why do we read about this one and that one and in fact Joseph told a lie no such thing as a white lie he told a lie all of sin and come short of the glory of God he want just a goody good boy he needed Christ like you and I don't never forget that despite the fact that Joseph stood for his God stood for his faith he could have done it on his own he was still the grace of God but when it turned around he still told a lie saying my people are herdsmen and not Shepherds because Shepherds were an Abomination to the Egyptians so we're all all are contaminated but here's the thing many of them was God now well pleased now those people they got a book it was open and then it shut and Jesus said your sin remains oh God think of it brother Terry you have to preach a funeral for somebody and you know they died in their sin and people are looking for some sort of Speck of maybe maybe maybe maybe they made it maybe they had a death bed oh my and no that that person went beyond the veil I've wondered about that brother Bram said plainly in the message one place he said the blood cannot go beyond the veil of death it cannot the blood will not reach into the regions of the Damned because the Redemption of the blood is on only here the only saving through the blood is to be done here in this Dimension he said you go he said a lost person goes beyond the reach of the blood I don't know about you but sister it makes me feel for people dying like flies oh I wish I could die oh I want Dr kavor and to put something in my arm the moment their heart stops and they go into the other dimension without God they're looking for somebody to bring them back but there ain't nobody to bring them back they realize they're lost the suffering in that body would be like a picnic compared to the torment that they're in right now what the devil's tricks brother Terry look how the devil plays with the minds of people their souls are lost they're seriously lost and and he dups them into believe in that kind of garbage he makes fools of his own children nothing good about the devil Paul he says these things were for our examples to the intent we should not lust after evil things as they also lusted neither be ye idolators neither let us commit fornication neither let us tempt Christ neither murmur ye as some of them also murmaid you see there's something about some Believers and we all need this let me tell you something we all need this this ain't just for some people it's just ain't for the Corinthian Church this is for everybody because there's some of us we stroll in our flesh some of us have real battles but there will come a time when you'll overcome that flesh that flesh is not going to dictate to you but you're going to believe in your heart that Christ has raised him from the dead why the promise comes down through that mystical channel of your soul and you see it you walk out of these do a changed person and you start living a different life the old Amos cs's dead the new man amen is moving on again he says in 1 Corinthians 10:11 all these things happen un them for examples they're written for our admonition upon whom the ends of the world are come they are written for our admonition we have to have record of these things they're examples to us as Believers now the Old Testament recorded everything it told it all didn't spare it it really tells it all now the New Testament there was a very big change and let me read to you if I can find it what Paul says here in the to the Corinthians 1 Corinthians 6 and9 he says now remember this know you not that the unrighteous that's the ones that ain't Blood Washed blood cleansed not even believing on the blood and not foolish virgins they're unbelievers know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God not going to make it not going to make it the blood's the only way he said says be not deceived neither fornicators nor idolators nor adulterers nor a feminite boy Paul is getting very graphic you got to remember this Corinthian Church was really steeped in carnality of the worst flowest sorts but you know God had children in there God had predestined elected seat you know and who are we to say you know oh well I wasn't like that sh shame on you you were polluted too all of us were contaminated all of us were filthy and unrighteous nor thieves nor Covetous nor drunkers nor revilers nor extortioners shall inherit the kingdom of God and then Paul makes this statement now notice what he says and such were some of you oh you get to to feeling pretty good about yourself maybe God has just left us a little bit of memory here not to dog us but to always realize David said I look back at the pit that he'd come out of he brought me out of the myy clay so God leaves a little bit of memory there but he says this of such were some of you but oh Hallelujah ye are washed ye are Sanctified you are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus by the spirit of our God Paul mentions it examples but he put no name to it no doubt Paul with a mind like you and I filled with the Holy Ghost he's up for preaching and here sitting in the second row is a man that lived with his stepmother over here is a former lesbian effeminate I don't even like to go into the details on that but Paul even knows this because he's prayed for some of these people to be delivered and had demons cast out but Paul no longer is looking now Paul knows this with his carnal mind and so do you some of you you know what your past was but Paul sees a daughter of God he sees a pure righteous sinless spotless blood-washed Soul who no longer displays the characteristics of a street wh or perverted boy he sees a son of God washed the precious blood of Jesus Christ and if Paul has the mind of God yeah he's he maybe he has to fight that thing he says oh I don't know uh did I have my shots because I got to sit down with some of these people and uh they might double dip you know and um they might have something that they picked up you know they can't get rid of and uh let me tell you something Paul believed in the power of God I don't think Paul was stupid I don't think he threw caution to the wind but Paul had the ability with the blood of Jesus Christ on his own soul knowing he was in a religious system he was a sinner he was a murderer a killer of Believers and he could look at these Gentiles at the Jews and say what kind of scumball are you associating with he could turn around and say just what Peter what God told Peter what God has cleansed called not unclean that's what Peter at the house of Cornelius seen all kinds of unclean things in a sheet oh no no no lord I can't eat that zebra I can't eat that hog there I can't I can't that's unclean that's unclean and God says what God has cleansed called not unclean Hallelujah God looks through the blood and says to the devil what God what I have cleansed through my blood go not unclean if God is for you like that why are you beating up on yourself when it don't even exist in the mind of of God that's not a figment of my imagination that's the truth before God you got to be able to get up on that stage yourself and say that it's either the truth or it ain't the truth that we got to start live it like it's a truth there is therefore now no condemnation to Sister Martha because she walks after the spirit and not after the Flesh and if God be for you then who can be against you you met the requirements you applied the token the token is on the door of your heart his Spirit lives in you that's the greatest mystery to me so why I wonder sometimes well if you're not certain make sure you got a word birth holy ghost in fire it burns out and kills that old man brother R said an invisible Union I'm going to close brother R said an invisible Union you just don't divorce this thing because in Romans chapter 7 you read that she's dead while she lives and if her first husband is still alive that first husband has to die there's only one thing that can do and that's the Holy Ghost and Fire when not life comes in the literal fire of God comes into your soul and burns out that old man and resurrects that little Jean seed there is no association whatsoever or identification with the world after that I don't I don't care who you tell me I don't we've heard so much of this message enough to show us that youve got people out here that'll work under the anointing preach under the anointing prophesy under the anoint and still be devils in their heart Prophet come along and said balum absolutely had a gift from God to prophesy you know who you know what his dictation was he had a gift but he hadn't given his heart to God he gave his tongue to God but he didn't give his heart to God his heart was after filthy lucer you would think after a donkey talks to you you listen that was Mercy you stop and think about that if donkey a horse starts talking to you is in a language he could understand too one all garble up like a bunch of tongues unknown tongues it was a tongue he stood coming from a donkey God speaking through a donkey to get balam's attention amen he buddy you're on the wrong road amen see that donkey seen the angel of the Lord standing there with a drawing sword that's right said I know one thing I ain't sure ain't going to try to bypass him he started beating you see the character bam started beating that donkey that donkey seen the Ang watch out watch watch out even sometimes we can get in the flesh we can start beating the donkey cuz the donkey ain't doing what we want the Donkey to do is Achieve our goals there may be something standing there that God has showed the donkey that if he was humble enough you'd say maybe I better go and repay pray about this thing again that donkey mashed his foot against the wall because he said I'm not I'm not going by that guy I'm not going by that angel with that drawing sword no way Jose I'm stay I'm going the other way takes a donkey sometimes to talk to people God old G sometimes sometimes we get in a shape we get in a spot where we become bullheaded we become so so determined and so I'm going to go through with this thing no no matter what you God loves us whom the Lord loveth he also chased us Bo I I'm so glad I got chasing from the Lord that that only testifies to who I am that's when I'm saying what sin what sin your record's clear am there was a account a stand were things yet Unforgiven list was growing greater day by day I went onto the keeper and I settle it long ago long ago long ago yes the old account was settled long ago and the records clear today for he washed my sins away and the old account was settled long ago long ago musicians long ago I settled it all yes the old account was settled long ago and my record's clear today for he washed my sins away the old account was settled long ago amen let's just stand long ago long ago I settled it all that's right yes the old account was settled long ago and my records cleared today for he washed my sins away you know some time ago I seen a a YouTube video of uh some prison somewhere and these were prisoners you know they look like older men and uh anyway they're probably in there for life I mean they looked all right they was but you know there was something about them they had they were singing in the chapel in the prison Chapel they were clapping their hands and worshiping the Lord singing like I think it was I'm not sure what it was Power in the Blood or something like that they look like free men to me no I say they look like free men they acted like free men you know why I don't know what level of spirituality they're at you know what there's some people that have sat in this church that are in Chains and those people were more free behind several layers of security electronic security and cameras those men were more free than some of us sometimes that comes into a church and here's a message there's no excuse Johnny Crow you're free you got to you got to get Deliverance you got to get Deliverance that demon in your mind I don't care what it was somebody may have molested you at a young age or something else that was pretty [Music] hideous you need you need Deliverance you need to get there sometimes these demons will hang around they know they know just exactly how to do it but I believe this that little old girl had she not gone she could have walked right on by that dance club and no doubt she did you know what I'm talking [Music] about do you remember that young girl brother ran and prayed with her led her to the Lord evil spirit left her and she went down there by what's his name a Stairs dance video club or whatever and she heard it and all of a sudden it pulls her in she comes back an evil spirit gets on her she's out there and she's doing the Twist and doing everything with some of her old friends no doubt all of a sudden it strikes your heart oh god what have I done what have I done comes running back to the prophet oh brother [Music] brother help me help me evil spirit is tormenting her she's in condemnation now and of course the devil knows how to beat up on you he'll make you feel good one minute and then just load you up with guilt brother R didn't say Oh Sister what did you do why did you do that let the correction come later the sister needs Deliverance right now oh brother right up you know what happened he starts praying for and the door starts bo bo bo boom there's an evil spirit in there and all of a sudden that thing come flying out of there and that guy laying on the bed that old uh or whatever laying on that bed and come flying out of there seeing that old thing with long hair hanging down don't down beside the bed what was it an evil spirit that got on her I don't know the end result of that sister but I'm going to tell you one thing I believe with all my heart the next time she's walking down that street House of hell you have no pull on me anymore and I want you to know that's the kind of life you and I can live God wants us to live like that house of hell you have no hold on me I'm free I'm free I don't want no ball and chain hanging off of me dragging around everywhere I [Applause] go I used to live like that [Music] spiritually it's miserable you feel miserable because the prophet even said you just get enough a God to make yourself miserable I remember when the Revelation first struck my heart and knew that this was a truth but I didn't let God have all of me I still was walking around married to the old man I didn't have a word bir still had a knowledge and reel I knew it was a truth and it was pulling on me but it's until I got that word birth those Spirits want me to do the things of the world ungodly things that Spirit left me when he got cast out Jesus come and sat on the throne of my [Music] heart all things are passed away remember that doesn't start and this is kind of like a big broad statement now that doesn't start when you walk through the gates of that City it starts now and the former thing shall not come into mind you say but I still got this so do I but I'm making new memories and packing them in there left and right so that all those older memories are getting packed so tight and they they're only found in my mind but I don't dig them up I don't go over to work say oh yeah I used to do this I hear some carnal Christians saying almost like they're bragging you know what they're doing they're resurrecting some of them just ain't had a word birth they still ain't dead [Music] yet at that life you make new memories that's why brother brand said he had a new book it was he had William brandom but you know what it was really the Lamb's Book his name was in that book so in other words it's no longer William Braham but it's Mrs Jesus Christ William Brown it's Mrs Jesus Christ Terry and Alice horn it's Mrs Jesus Christ brother so and so brother so and so sister so and so it's the new book there is only one new book that's the book of redemption but you've got a little verse in there and it's called the book of Acts of Terry Horn and you know what Greater Works than these shall you do because I go to my father you're doing the Greater Works so Jesus Christ is's actually able to do more through our life than what he could when he was here on Earth now that's just not the prophet that's also you and I he can do more through a multi-member body you love the Lord tonight thank you for your attention I know Sunday nights sometimes we are tired and and so forth and uh I just thank you for praying for me and pray for me in the upcoming whatever uh I just feel like I don't know I feel like something good is about to [Music] happen it's always good I told somebody here not long ago it's always good you know a squeeze comes whatever it's it's it's still good cuz God's going to prove himself you've got the authority to speak a world into existence now it's CED by a law and that's where now don't don't cut yourself too short by saying that that's like a lot of people will quote that quote they'll say they'll say well the bride just keep still if if she doesn't feel the leadership of the Lord she'll just keep still you keep it still too long why you doing sitting at thy red light done turn green a long time [Music] ago that's legalism shaking that off fear fear you're going to get out of order I think somebody said from this Pulpit here in one during during the meetings or whatever about time some of us would get out of order so we need to be corrected I'm not saying to get out of order but you know what I'm talking about that's why the prophet said I'd have a little bit of wildfire no fire at all God help me I don't want to become an old starchy Lutheran Methodist Presbyterian no way Jose no way Jose am I going to go back to that kind of junk trash lifeless morbid nah nah nah nope sorry I don't mean to be rude or crude but I'm going to tell you one thing it's about time we get the mind of God you really see who you are the the think about it is as a brother or sister you might be given the worst job on the on the job site and still possess this knowledge you might get demoted with men you're promoted with God God's already promoted you don't worry about it that little girl didn't worry about that when their cousins making fun of her and she's saving up her pennies to buy that wedding dress she didn't worry about what they were going to say to her she didn't worry about all that other nonsense that's on the internet they got going on right now questioning the prophet oh this that and the other didn't pay no attention to it you come too late to tell me I'll never forget brother Justin Decker's answer to some of these unbelievers that try to talk him out of the message he said this message changed my my life this message introduced me to Jesus Christ you can't talk me out of it he was a former Catholic didn't have no evangelic or Pentecostal Holiness upbringing whatsoever grew up in a Catholic home preaching this [Music] message glory to
