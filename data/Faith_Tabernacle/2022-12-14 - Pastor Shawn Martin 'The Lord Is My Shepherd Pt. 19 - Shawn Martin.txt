children praise the Lord but uh so she needs our prayers as well she can get uh get caught up on some rest praise the Lord but if you have your Bibles we're going to turn to the uh the book of Psalms the 23rd chapter and um he is the Lord well are you glad you're a Christian a believer yeah got a lot just to be excited about under expectation night Doom and Gloom for the world but you know it ain't gonna be long we're going to be out of here be caught up and to meet our Lord and I'm just looking forward to that time before we go into the word and may we just buy our heads and talk to the author of the word father it is so good to be able to call you our father law relationship that we have with you Lord as Sons and Daughters your children oh God knowing that we're the apple of your

and I believe it pleases you just to be with us and Lord we just humbly ask that you would now have your way in help us Lord help me to get myself out of the way and that you would speak through these mortal lips father and that you would anoint your people the hearts the years Lord to receive to understand we ask it father that your Liberty would just be here father we ask it in Jesus Christ's name amen praise the Lord it's got a little ring to it the Psalms 23 we're going to start at the first verse but it says the Lord is my shepherd I shall not one he maketh me to lie down in Green Pastures he leadeth me beside the Still Waters he restoreth my soul elateth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake amen you can have your seats this evening we've been on this chapter for a while now and I pray it's been a blessing to you as it has to me and then studying it and tonight I'm going to deal with the the last part of the third chapter we've been talking on he restoreth my soul for a while and uh but tonight he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness and I want to Endeavor to show the contrast that's that's the the point tonight is to show a contrast to the path of righteousness for there is always a contrast uh as brother Branham said it you know it's the law of contrast it takes the night to show the day it takes the it it takes the evil to show the good it it takes it it always takes the opposite to show the the the other side and so here David is speaking about Paths of righteousness and and so we We Know by that statement that God does not lead his sheep into just some some path uh uh but he leads a sheep in Paths of righteousness and the Bible tells us that the footsteps of a righteous man are ordered of the Lord ain't that right so I looked up this word path and according to Webster the word path is a course a root a way of life a way of thought or conduct so that's that's what the word path would mean is the course a root a way of life a way of thought or conduct so when just take for instance when we see a young child boy girl doing things that are wrong um and they could start at a at a very young age and and but as they're growing we we would say they're walking down a wrong path there's there's something there and what we are saying by that statement is that that boy or that girl if there's not a correction they're going to develop a behavior they're going to develop habits they're going to develop a character they're going to develop um and and if if if the situation isn't corrected when they're young then when they get older and you start seeing them same traits just in a more matured way then you know they're walking down a wrong path we would say that and and so then they're going to be worse than what they are now uh they grow up then they're going to be in trouble with the law if they can't respect mom and dad at home uh if they can't respect the house of God if they can't respect uh the authority that they're under uh when they're young then you mark it down if God does not intervene with that child then they will get older to where they won't respect the law they won't respect any kind of authority they'll have trouble not only with the law they'll have trouble in their marriage uh if a child grows up to be very haughty disrespectful mouthy having his own way all the time then he won't be able when he gets older to deal with issues he won't be able to he'll always want his way he'll always want it see so if a child sneaks around and steals little things from Mom or Dad or or a child is constantly telling lies or talks about filthy things well it's a path it's a path that that child is walking down that if if somehow they're not corrected and of course ultimately they're going to need the Holy Ghost uh because they have a nature that will take them down a certain Road uh uh there and and so it's it's uh uh there but as they grow up then the more the more trouble they come into the more the child becomes involved in things that is wrong uh and and the path that he or she is on is taking them in a certain direction it's it's a path and and so uh he or she will become a drunk or a drug addict or or become involved in sexual activity and or they will be involved in worse things and may eventually end up in jail or prison or whatever but but it's a path and and so as as as as parents when we when we have our young children it's not just having children and and it's so sad today that that people are Are Young Generation uh and and I'm not talking here but I'm just talking about in the world generally that that they just want to have babies and and really it's not really thinking about babies as much as they want to just have sex you know and and have these relationships and and not caring about responsibility not caring about uh the aftermath of their res you know of their actions and and before you know it they're they're they're giving their babies to be adopted they're they're um uh uh you know they're killing them they they just don't want that responsibility you know uh of these things but here brother Branham says this and and and and I just throw this in there because we're talking about path that you mothers have a great responsibility of what that child will be it will be raised on the way you start your child on the path that it must travel another place brother Brown said mother has the responsibility from God to place that child on the right Road and I think that's why mothers has a special little touch ain't that right I know my mom sure had a special touch you know and I sure love my mom today but uh uh now now for you mothers that that have we were children and and things like that I don't don't don't beat yourself up that's not the point of what we're trying to say tonight uh because children uh uh until they get the Holy Ghost they they're vulnerable to anything and you can do the best and you can and and steal if if well brother Brown talked about Billy Paul if if if he didn't get the Holy Ghost rock and roll with catch him and and even we will but this way in Billy Paul's testimony uh he talks about how he went out out in the world and he was gambling he was he become a gambler and and he talks about of how that is probably the reason if I've got it right if I've heard it's been a little while since I heard it but the reason why his dad wouldn't let him play with dice uh uh uh no game with dots you know he wanted to play I think it was monopolies and to buy it and and uh but he wasn't allowed to play with dice and his dad said no you you can unless you have some other way to play that but uh uh so uh but but it I I did he if I can understand that right that he felt like brother Branham his dad uh saw something there that that he was have an addiction or having a problem with and and so on until he got the Holy Ghost you see so so but what we're saying is that that that there is a certain path and in that path um there's there's there's character character traits there is is a nature there are habits there are things that that we start walking down and and so uh uh and and it's sad to say that there are mothers and dads that do not care how their child uh it turns out to be uh uh they they just don't care they'll leave them to television and right now this day they leave them to phones um to let them you know whatever satisfies them that's fine with us as long as we don't have to deal with it you know what I mean and and so they they don't care about anything of their children and a lot of it is because they don't know and that's really sad is they don't know how to raise a child because of this society today that uh uh motherhood is broken and and all of these things but our character our conduct and habits reflect the path that we are on now brother Branham says we should not be just getting about from place to place we should always go and consider the Lord before we go do you do you do that when you leave home pray Lord help me to have a safe journey over where I'm going and back ordering my steps today that I'll not step out of your blessed path but if I shouldn't make the wrong move you'll warn me and bring me right back into the right way again if my tongue should start to speak things that was not right uh uh will you just stop my tongue from speaking bring me back into the place uh uh the right place again and if I should start thinking wrong thoughts will you just change my way of thinking and let me think the right things it's important now it's important that we talk right that we think right that that that we act right that that everything about us because it reflects the path it reflects what we're walking down and so he says now what you think is usually what you do so it all comes by thought first ain't that right what you think is what you do that's why don't don't think negative thoughts because you'll start acting negative ain't that right amen now now that uh uh and I'm going to try to hurry here because I got a lot to say and and uh and we ain't gonna keep you long but at the same time what you think is the way you act and and so so we we have that ability to cast the negative thoughts out we we have that ability not to dwell on anything negative can you say man well it's true if you've got the Holy Ghost you do have that ability if you'll train yourself Amen in the word of God and so he says now he said what you think is usually what you do you know if you'll do right that's your duty to God everybody say that's my duty to God what's your duty to God by doing right ain't that right if you'll think right that's your duty to yourself ain't that right and you've got to come out right see so so if you do right that's your duty to God if you'll think right that's your duty to yourself and you've got to come out right see you can't be going east when you're going west and you can't be going wrong when you're going right or vice versa so think right do right and you'll be right ain't that right so so there's a path that we're going to take that it's a path that we're going to walk down and this is what David is talking about path path of righteousness and and so there there is that path of righteousness and so and and and as we will see a man's character a man's conduct and his habits will reflect as to whether or not he is walking on the path of righteousness ain't that right you say well I go to church that don't mean always that you're walking in the path of righteousness it's it's what you are as an individual that reflects if you're walking the the what whatever path you're walking now in the natural if you're wanting to go to a certain place well then then you want to you you want to find a path that will take you there ain't that right now uh uh we we've walked the Cascades you know going to the Cascade Falls well there there there's a path there and and you you walk that path and and and to know that we're on the path they've got signs that'll tell you exactly where you're headed where it's going to take you so so you get on that path if I'm wanting to go to Kentucky I don't get it on the path that that goes to to the Cascades you understand what I'm saying I I'm on a certain path because there it's going to take me in a certain direction now you there's also the path that's called the Appalachian Trail that that just comes right down through uh here and and that path takes you from Georgia to Maine right and and so you can get on that path and it's got signs to tell you where you're headed ain't that right see it's a path and and so now as Believers we want to go to heaven ain't that right we we want to go to be at that wedding supper I don't know about you but I want to be there I want to be in attendance I want to be part of that I I want to go on a honeymoon in the Millennium amen with my my Lord ain't that right I I we want to receive the changing of our body we we want to be a part of this Rapture that is imminent wait it's here upon us church and we want to be a part of that I mean he wants to be a part of that I don't want to be left behind I I certainly don't want you to be left behind I want us all to go together and and to be a part of this uh not just to read about it where he'll dry every tear from our eye but one of these days it's going to be reality amen and and you know how you dream about it and maybe you talk about vacation what we're going to go here and and and we're going to do this we're going to do that it's all planned out going to Florida or go to Canada or go wherever it but it's all planned out and and but and you're planning you're planning and you're planning and then all of a sudden you're right into the plans you're walking in the plans it's it's no longer planning but it's it's there you're in it it's everything that you live for or planned for and and safe for it's it's right there you understand what I'm saying well that's the way it's going to be one of these days it ain't gonna be just talking about a marriage supper we'll be there no more just dreaming and talking about him drying the tear from our eye it literally happened he will literally wipe every tear from your eye yeah it's something that will not just be a desire anymore it'll be a reality and you can say oh I longed for this day I long for it and here it is well we're wanting that and and we should never lose that desire we know that time has come to its end we know the Great Tribulation which is God's judgment uh uh is upon the Earth the cup of iniquity is full ain't that rhyme a man see and and yet the believer doesn't have to fear because there is a path can you say man there there is a path that takes that believer in that direction whatever he's Desiring there's a path a man that takes us to what we desire ain't that right don't think that we're just sitting around here waiting we're walking a path there is a path uh to walk and David would call it the paths of righteousness can you say man see we're not just sitting around twiddling our thumb there is a destination that we're that that we're headed to it's it's a destination we're about to reach we're almost at the end I'll tell you the joy of coming to the end of a trail the joy of coming to the end of the path I promise you you know the last time uh we walked uh uh the Cascades we took the hard route you know and I always do that because I like Challenge and it about killed me and and you know I I I got uh uh just a little ways and I'm soaked you know just just drenched and and my legs are hurting you know and and I'm weak because you know my legs are just shaky and but I kept plowing and I saw these women come by us and they got a child she's got a child on her back and she's moving I thought if she could do it I'm gonna do it you know and I just kept I wouldn't say anything I just about to die you know but then I see that sign that says you're almost there or whatever it says and to me it didn't matter what it said I just said it as you're there keep on keep on and all the Delight amen when I saw that last sign you know and then when I got there oh my word you know what a it was a joy you know and I think well if that's in the natural well so is it in the spiritual we see every sign that tells us we're about there do you see them signs the the trouble that's in the world is assigned to us a prophet coming in this day is assigned to us amen the the politics being shaken up is a sign to us Russia doing what she's doing is assigned to us the earthquakes that are happening all around is assigned to us the trouble of the nature a man that is just going just wacky it's a sign to us that we're almost there keep walking the path oh yeah you're not just wondering it's a path you're not just wandering around there is a path that's taken you where you want to go so we find that one path doesn't lead us to all kinds of places a path takes you to a certain destination ain't that right so you most certainly don't want to walk down a path or begin a path if you don't know where it's going to take you you might walk five miles and realize you've walked the wrong path that'd be rough then you say man so so you don't want to do that in the natural and you especially don't want to do it when it comes to your Eternal destination you want to walk a path that will take you to the right place ain't that right so so then now we know that there's more than one path to walk on now of course uh uh uh uh David said the Lord leadeth me the Lord is my shepherd He leads me in the paths of righteousness can you say Amen so then if you're going to walk in a trail or in a path of life you want to make sure it's the Lord that is leading you because he's not going to mislead you no I don't believe that he ain't going to mislead you but he'll lead you on the right path which is the paths of righteousness can you say man and he leads us by his voice ain't that right he leads us by his voice which is the word manifested for the age ain't that right so he will now listen now these Paths of righteousness now he it will never lead us away from Green Pastures he'll never lead us away from The Still Waters all along these Paths of righteousness is the Green Pastures all along the paths of righteousness a man is the Still Waters can you say Amen but now notice that the two paths because uh uh Jeremiah 21 8 it says unto this people Thou shalt say thus saith the Lord behold I set before you the way of life and the way of death so in all reality there are two paths to walk down in Matthew 7 and 13 Jesus talks about these two paths he says enter ye in at the Straight Gate for wide is the gate and Broad is the way that lead us to destruction and many everybody say many there be which go in there at because straight is the gate and narrow is the way which lead us unto life and view there be that find it now I'm going to say this that only the predestinator is going to find it only the Sheep is going to find it and as I've said before you didn't stumble on these green paths you didn't stumble amen uh beside the Still Waters you just didn't happen to come here he leads me in the paths of righteousness can you say man it's just that way see and so they they find it because the Lord is their Shepherd and it is him that leads it and and his sheep have the desire to know and they pray a man to know his paths can you say man look look at David Psalms 25 and 4 show me thy ways O Lord now this is the Sheep talking to God the shepherd show me thy ways O Lord so again the relationship is is not a cowboy and Rodeo we we ain't talking about this this is people that are uh uh that are willing that are subjection uh subjective that are Desiring amen the way of the Lord and so he says show me thy ways I O Lord teach me thy paths Lead Me in thy truth and teach me for thou art the god of my salvation on thee do I wait all the day can you say man so if you'll notice these two paths have been given various names in the Bible and and uh uh we just read one where uh uh uh uh one is is is a broad path uh that many walk down this path and the other one is a narrow path that very few uh will find a man and and so this broad path leads to destruction The Narrow Path leads to life ain't that right and so according to Proverbs 2 13 the broad path is the ways of Darkness a man which is totally different from the paths of righteousness so this broad path is is a way of darkness and the other is the paths of righteousness and if you look John 8 and 12 Jesus said I am the light of the world now he's already told us that he is the great Shepherd ain't that rhyme he's our Shepherd do you all believe that that Jesus Is Our Shepherd now he's telling us I'm the light now your Shepherd brother Bill is the light of the world Amen see and he that followeth me everybody say he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness so that's a guarantee that you will not walk the path of Darkness if the Lord is your Shepherd ain't that right but shall have the light of life amen praise the Lord so in first John 1 6 John puts a distinction between the two paths by saying if we say that we have fellowship with him and walk in darkness we lie and do not the truth ain't that right now David called that path in one place uh uh well he he says here uh Psalms 25 5 in his prayer again he says Lead Me in thy truth can you say Amen so Lead Me in thy truth you're walking in truth you're not lying can you say Amen if you're walking in truth that that your conduct your nature your behavior your your habits a man is it's it's all about truth hello it's reflecting a man the the path that you're walking down in and so if we're saying we have fellowship with him and we're walking in darkness then we're lying wait you're not walking in that path of Truth ain't that right and you're not doing the truth yes sir I think it'd be whose and us to find what path and to make sure we're walking in the right path this isn't the time to to just be floating around this isn't the time Amen to and and I'm not saying that you're not walking in the path I'm just saying let's be sober ain't that right we got to be sober about these things it's just not living every day and and bypassing time and until the Lord comes we must live sober now the path of righteousness I believe is the same path that Jesus said is the Narrow Path and it's the path of Truth David says Lead Me in thy truth and you say man so again if we say that we have fellowship and walk in darkness we lie and do not the truth now notice notice the warning that God gives us proverbs 4 and 14 enter not everybody's saying or not into the path of the wicked and go not in the way of evil men avoid it pass by pass not by it turn from it pass away and you say man you understand this he's he's he's he's he's telling us don't just go happy go lucky through life amen there's two paths One path avoid One path shun One path get away from flee with all that's within you can you say amen that's exactly right now notice 16th verse for they sleep not except they have done mischief and their sleep is taken away unless they call some to fall for they eat the bread of wickedness now Jesus said he is our bread and you say man so we're not eating the bread of weakness wickedness but those that are walking in this path of wickedness is eating the bread of wickedness and drink the wine of violence but notice but the path of the just is as The Shining Light that shine is more and more unto a perfect day can you say man a a a day of finale a day of realization a day when everything that is in the scripture is being fulfilled and you say man a perfect day yes sir and The Way of the Wicked is as Darkness so this path is a path of Darkness it's the path of of of wickedness amen and it's the Way of the Wicked is as Darkness they know not at what they stumble ain't that right so again inner not into the path of the wicked and go not in the way of evil men avoid it pass not by it turn from and and pass away don't take on their habits then you say man don't take on their way of life don't don't come under their umbrella so to speak don't come form to their ways their thought pattern their lifestyle it's not the path for you and you say Amen it's a way of Darkness it's a it's an evil way now listen those that walk that path are anointed with the different anointing than what you're Anointed with they are under the control of a different power than what you uh what power you are under for theirs is the power of Darkness that's what Paul's saying it's a power of Darkness can you say amen amen so shun that path there's an anointing in that path that you don't want to come under you think people are doing what they're doing just because no it's an anointing upon them sure is their spirit is a different spirit than what God's people have God's people has a sheep like nature they have a a a holy spirit can you say man you young people might say well you know uh people I work with people I hang out with people I whatever you know they're all Christians they they've all say they've had a real experience with God they talk about God all the time tell others about God and and all these things and that's great but let me tell you something right now we're not ignorant of what goes on in the world and the only reason why is we've had a prophet identified the two Spirits in this age can you say Amen and I'll tell you this only everybody say only the elect will have the Holy Ghost only the elect will have the Holy Ghost and you say Amen only the elect will have their soul restored only the elect will be feeding off a uh uh the Green Pastures only the elect will be planted and be led by The Still Waters only the elect will be led in the paths of righteousness and you say man you say well what is the Holy Ghost you know what the Holy Ghost is it's the spirit of Truth ain't that right your Shepherd is the spirit of Truth ain't that right now notice John 16 13 will will verify this how be it when he the person Christ the spirit of Truth is come he will guide you in not truth all truth and you say man the spirit of Truth when he comes he will guide you not in part truth some truth all truth everybody say all truth your Shepherd is going to lead you in the paths of righteousness and he ain't going to lead you part way and then steer you off he's going to lead you in all the path of righteousness all truth and you say man now notice for he shall not speak of himself but whatsoever he shall hear that shall he speak and he will show you things to come so who's your Shepherd who's your leader the spirit of Truth he's the one that's going to walk you and lead you go before you in the paths of righteousness he's the one that's going to light your way for he said I am the light of the world ain't that right and here now he's saying when he comes to you he's going to lead you into truth all truth ain't that right now notice John 16 15. Jesus said all thing that the all things that the father hath are mine therefore said I that he shall take of mine and shall show it unto you who sheep gotta have something to feed off of so he's gonna feed you but not only is he going to feed you he's going to show these things unto you in other words he's showing you the paths of righteousness he's leading you in the path you're not going to show you some you know gimmick you're not going to just show you something that man conjured up he's going to show you the things to come that are the truth now if you look at it in John 17 17 Jesus said Thy word is truth ain't that right so so here he will lead you and guide you into all truth all everybody say all the word all the word opening of the book all the word can you say man so now we're walking in these Paths of righteousness see and so he leads us in the paths of righteousness which is the path of Truth which is the word of God I hope you understand now how how would we know as to whether or not it was the word unless it was clearly thoroughly Vindicated of God and proven that it is the truth aren't you glad that God would prove it and Vindicated and thoroughly Vindicated so that we would not have to guess and wonder what is the truth there is so much deception out here and so much a fake and fraud and and impersonations and all of that but God would thoroughly vindicate it that we would know whether or not we're walking in the path of righteousness now if you look second Corinthians 3 and 17 it says now the Lord he is that spirit and where the spirit of the Lord is there is Liberty now I'm going to tell you this amen this scripture means much to us The Lord Is Our Shepherd the Lord is the spirit of Truth and the Lord is that Spirit of Liberty can you say Amen so if you're walking and you're following the Lord your Shepherd there will be a liberty to believe the truth there will be a liberty to walk in the paths of righteousness there will be a liberty to say Amen to the word of God all the word of God can you say Amen see so there is Liberty to see into all the things that have been shown or revealed to us ain't that right there is Liberty to receive what has been shown in the paths of righteousness you're not walking in darkness these Paths of righteousness is not a path or a way of Darkness but there is light in that path that you can see in other words it's a path of Revelation I hope you understand so there is Liberty to receive amen what has been shown in the path of righteousness what is it to have why why would we want the spirit of truth if we cannot see the truth why why would he lead us and say I'm your spirit of Truth and where the Lord is there is Liberty I am your Liberty and yet we look and say well I don't believe it I can't see it I just don't understand it so the Lord couldn't even walk us if if that be the case then it becomes a way of Darkness to us if you're blind I I don't care I don't care how much light there is around us if we're blind we're blind you're gonna need to be led you're you're you you're going to walk you're gonna in darkness you're going to stumble around but God's people ain't blind can you say man we're not blind to this word this word has been open to us under the seventh seal can you say Amen I hope this makes sense to you there is Liberty to walk in the paths of righteousness can you say Amen the paths of righteousness has to do with this word can you say Amen the past the walking in the paths of righteousness has to do with light it has to do with you having Liberty to walk in it it has to do with God opening your eyes to see it to open in your ears to understand it can you say Amen to believe so then here we are a woman cannot have the Holy Ghost the spirit of Truth Spirit of Liberty and then refuse to come subject to the word of God you know that's true a holy ghost-filled woman will not wear skimpy clothes that causes men to left ass to her I don't care what experience she says she's got the Holy Ghost will not allow her to put on them give me clothes to have the sons of God to fall after her it ain't going to happen hello you say oh give them time give them time give them time I have you to know brother Brown said there was heathen women that were undressed Expo exposed in the upper part of their body didn't know no better wasn't talked but when they came into the presence of God they covered themselves up I think that's what people need more today is coming into the presence of God education ain't gonna do it God will do it ain't that right you can't grow out of your temper you can't grow out of of your pride you can't grow out of rebellion it's got to take God to deliver you from them things that's right so a holy ghost-filled woman will not wear tight clothes that shows her form can you say man if any of you young sisters getting tempted by that you just tell that devil it's a lie that ain't me that ain't the path that I'm walking down on then you say Amen that's right a Holy Ghost Field woman will not wear shirts or blouse solo to wear her bosom show it ain't gonna happen I don't care how discouraged a woman gets I don't care how how uh uh uh dark in the valley she is the Holy Ghost will be there I just believe that and I thank God for you Elder sisters that still hold a conviction and it ain't because you're old fatty Daddy it's because there's a holy ghost there that won't let you do otherwise that's right she may be a nice woman maybe sincere but just flat honest she ain't got the Holy Ghost dressing like the world no it ain't gonna happen can you say Amen Amen brother Brown taught us we don't fashion after the world we don't wear Fashions of the world and that just we we I know we always put it to women but that's boys too can you say Amen these boys that are dressing like they're sissies it ain't got no right for a Holy Ghost Boy to do it just ain't can you say amen and and it's just the truth we're talking about Paths of righteousness there is there either a path of righteousness or there's the other path and and we're not stumbling our way through this thing you're not going to stumble your way and just happen to make it to Heaven There is a light that's lightened the path of righteousness to where you can see your way you know what you're doing you know and you say man that's right you know what brother Brown says that woman will have he said there's an honorary filthy Spirit on her making her do that and she don't know it and you say man we're not trying to be mean and that's not it we we ain't out for nobody I I wish people would get that out of their mind they think when you talk about you know something you they just automatically think oh you're talking about so-and-so that's not true we're just preaching the gospel and I don't care who it hurts it's just the facts I was listening to brother Brown today he said you got he says I don't want to say it hard I don't have to or or want to do that but you have to do it to to tighten the nail down and sometimes we have to do that maybe it's not in here that maybe someone's listening on that internet that's having some issues here and I'm telling you why amen it ain't got no place in a Holy Ghost Field life now brother Brown said some of the women put on these nasty clothes and get out here to throw their yourself before man Jesus said whosoever Luke of the born a woman to lust after her has committed adultery with her already in his heart then who is guilty the man or you he is a male maid so he could take this ax see and you're the female that ought to refuse and why do you put yourself out like that it ain't for comfort oh no it ain't for comfort you know it can't be when you're half froze to death with them shorts on can't be for comfort then what is it it's for Filth and you won't admit it but it's the Bible says so it's the truth can you say Amen and if we're walking down the path of Truth these Paths of righteous we can say Amen to this it's the truth ain't that right see it's it's it's a filthy Spirit that's in you you don't want to be filthy but you don't realize spiritually you are filthy because you're presenting yourself filthy and you say Amen the Holy Ghost filled woman will take off her britches and act like a lady should true Holy Ghost filled man we'll quit wearing them shorts brother Brown say that's that's that's that's well he said he said actually they're women's undergarments so he said you know uh uh Holy Ghost filled man he'll quit watching things that he shouldn't be watching he'll quit saying things that he shouldn't be saying and you say Amen see the Holy Ghost will lead people out of the denominations you can't tell me that they just sat there in them denominations that don't have a conviction about it if they've got the Holy Ghost because the age that we're living in is the spirit that is crying out come out of her my people and that Holy Ghost that came to you and said come out it cannot be the Holy Ghost and another man that allows him to stay in that denomination it ain't gonna happen and you say Amen if they're really filled with the Holy Ghost they'll come out of them denominations something will make them leave they'll have to go they're not happy ain't that right many claim to have the Holy Ghost and yet denied Jesus name baptism as being the truth and they'll tell you they talk about Jesus they witnessed everybody they just saw this and nice people I'm not saying they're not nice amen but I'm telling you they ain't got the Holy Ghost you cannot have the Holy Ghost which is the spirit of Truth and then denies the truth at the same time they claiming to be walking with the Lord and yet we'll reject the truth that a woman isn't to be preaching they reject the truth of Holiness and clean living and yet claim to have a real experience with the Lord they deny the fact that God sent a prophet to us in the day when it's right there in the Bible and has been proven time and time again it's a path they denied the truth that God still performs Miracles and does signs and wonders and you say Amen now I'll tell you this if a person don't have the Holy Ghost no telling what kind of a spirit they'll they'll they'll have they can come under any kind of an anointing any under any kind of spirit it's true and that's what's driving people crazy today is they they don't know that that that little boy was so nice he was so good maybe come out of a good home and look where he's at today a murderer or a uh uh uh a rapist or whatever it's because if you ain't got the Holy Ghost you'll come under some demonic spirit they're vulnerable to every demon that's out there and you say man a person without the Holy Ghost is vulnerable to every demon that is out there every spirit that's why parents need to be careful about what your children are listening to be careful as to what they're hanging around be careful as who they're hanging around be careful as where they're hanging around watch what they're feeding off keep them in the right atmosphere at all times and you say man now we know as the prophet taught us that a spirit can get a hold of a man and possessing make him cut himself and act like a maniac the Bible talks about it about the man of gathering but notice what brother Brown says but a religious spirit can make a man to where he is a shrewd scholar another place he said a religious sinner is the worst sinner of them all it's the worst spirit and the Antichrist spirit is not communist it's a religious spirit ain't that right brother Branham said the religious spirit all down through the every age has always been a denier a denier ain't that right it's the religious spirit that has always denied the real genuine spirit of God every time God's spirit comes in and and and with signs and wonders following the spirit of God that's religious spirit denies it he hates it can you say Amen remember Cain was the son of Satan that's why the prophet said and yet he was religious he had a form of godliness he built an altar right Bill Graham goes he built the church he built everything religious just as Abel did he worshiped God yet done it all without revelation ain't that right so you can walk the path of the wicked and be religious ain't that right but you cannot walk the path of righteousness without revelation you can walk the path of the wicked and be religious without revelation righteous path he's your light so there will be Revelation and what did Brother Brown say pray for revelation ain't that right so we find that Cain he was not an unbeliever yet God absolutely refused him the prophet said Abel had revelation and that made him just before God is that right brother Brown said only by revelation will a man be able to see Divine Healing only by revelation will he be able to see the baptism of the Holy Ghost everything is by revelation Drive I hope this helps you got to give the contrast so you can understand what righteousness is Paths of righteousness amen now let's look at a scripture in Proverbs Proverbs 2 11 discretion shall preserve thee understanding shall keep thee listen to deliver everybody say to deliver to deliver thee from the eve the way of the evil man from the man that speaketh through word things Now look up that word forward it means perverse so to deliver thee from the way of Eve the evil man from the man that speaketh perverse things who leave the paths of uprightness to walk in the ways of Darkness who Rejoice to do evil and Delight in the forwardness and I looked up that fruwardness it means perverse things of the wicked can you say man whose ways are crooked and they are forward in their paths so notice the characteristics and the behavior of the man that walks this path of Darkness he speaks perverse things and he's left the path of uprightness to walk in the paths of Darkness he's made his choice you say Amen now I'm going to give you and I'm going to close here in just a minute but I'm going to give you some some things here but but so listen as we go the path of a brightness is a straight path it's a path of light revelation the word uprightness signifies that it is a straight path the right path so they've left the path of uprightness the straight path it's not crooked now now all of us you know uh bro Jr he's he's from the the flat land you go there in Ohio man you can see forever you know I uh uh says tell me says Jim we'd love to go for drive but you know when you step out of the house you just about see everything so instead of wasting gas we just we just get get out and look around say oh that was nice now let's go back in yo but around here you have to go for a drive because because everything's so crooked ain't that right I love going for drives it's relaxing but but there's a lot of Curves and and you don't want to be drunk when you're driving on on these roads right and so he's left this straight path to walk in the path or the way of Darkness so then that tells us the path of a brightness is a path of light a path of Revelation now Isaiah 26 and 7 The Way of the just is uprightness thou most upright does the way the path of the just can you say Amen now notice the the man the habits the the nature the the characteristics of of the man that walks in the path of of Darkness he rejoices to do evil and delights in the forwardness OR perverse things of the wicked his ways are crooked his paths are crooked didn't you say man when you can't you know you're driving down the road that's crooked you can't see too far yellow especially around here you don't know what is around the corner ain't that right and they forward the Bible says in their paths now I looked this word up perverse it's something that is turned away from what is right or good it's corrupt turned away from its original state or original condition ain't that right so here the man that walks in the way of Darkness Delights rejoices Delights in perverse things incredible to me because coming more perverse the human mind the lifestyle Society even our food politics marriage home life motherhood the way of life religion all of it is Tainted with perversion I'm still my wife I don't understand why these nominal so-called Christians and and even message folks that claim to be message are so wrapped up in politics as if something can save the world I just listen to brother Branham he said you can put every Lincoln in every every George Washington and all that in every County every office it ain't going to save the nation it ain't going to save the world it's sunk it's over it's gone it's perverse can you say man and I don't know about you I don't want to stay here much any longer I don't want to be a part of this world system any longer there is another kingdom that isn't perverse that isn't corrupt true got a president that's bringing all these homos and transgenders and idiots in our in offices that are running this nation God help us and you say Amen so notice they who walk the paths of Darkness speak perverse things things that are not original they're corrupt and they Delight in perverse things and if you'll notice this is the same path that Balaam walked in in Numbers 22 32 the angel of the Lord said unto him Balaam behold I went out to withstand thee because thy way is perverse before me he was doing something that was contrary to what God had wanted him to do then you say man that's the path that's that that's that broad way that's that that's that way of Darkness it's a perverse way Proverbs 28 and 6 better is the poor that walketh in his uprightness than he that is perverse in his ways though he be rich in other words we'd rather be poor and be in the path of a brightness then to have all the wealth of the world and walk a perverse path Proverbs 14 2 he that walketh in his uprightness feareth the Lord hello reverence respect but he that is perverse in his ways despises him despises the law of the Lord and He is the word ain't that right he's our light and they despise the light he's our Shepherd they despise his leadership come on church it's true he that is perverse in his ways despises him he is the spirit of Truth in Proverbs 8 and 7 wisdom which is the spirit of God As We Know Cries Out saying my mouth shall speak truth and wickedness is an Abomination to my lips all the words of my mouth are in righteousness there is nothing everybody say there is nothing forward or perverse in them amen they are all playing to him that understandeth and write to them that find knowledge oh he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness Hallelujah now know this as we close back in Proverbs 2 now Solomon goes on to say that they are fruard in their paths this path of of of Darkness and and this of course is the path of the wicked now I looked up again that word forward in in that and and it uh it says habitually disposed to Disobedience and opposition listen now they are fruard in their paths and you say man this broad way they are fruard in other words habitually disposed to Disobedience and opposition in other words they are set to disobey and oppose now in Ephesians 2 and 2 Paul calls them the children of disobedience ain't that right and this is exactly what Israel the way Israel was in the wilderness if you look in Deuteronomy 31 27 Moses speaks unto the Levites says I Know Thy rebellion and thy stick neck and stiff neck behold while I am yet alive with you this day you have been rebellious against the Lord and how much more after my death gather unto me all the Elders of your tribes and your officers that I may speak these words in their ears and call Heaven and Earth to record against them for I know that after my death you will utterly corrupt yourselves and turn aside from the way which I have commanded you and evil will befall you in the latter days because you will do evil in the sight of the Lord to provoke him to anger through the work of your hands and Moses spake in the ears of all the congregation of Israel the words of this song until they were ended now you go into this 32nd chapter and first verse give here all ye heavens and I will speak and hear o Earth the words of my mouth my Doctrine shall drop as the rain my speech shall distill as the do as the small rain upon the tender herb as the showers upon the grass because I will publish the name of the Lord ascribe ye greatness unto our God he is The Rock he his work is perfect for all his ways our judgment a god of Truth and without iniquity just and right is he they have corrupted themselves their spot is not the spot of his children they are a perverse and crooked generation then you say Amen so by what we're saying that we can see that this path of darkness is the way of the rebellious and stiff net who speaks perverse things and delights in the perverse things of the world notice what the Apollo Apostle Paul even speaks of Satan there in second Thessalonians 2 and 4 who opposes and exalteth ain't that right who opposes and exaltes not politics not the church not not governments but above all that is called God or that is worshiped so that he as God sitteth in the temple of God showing himself that he is God and you say Amen so we see that this clearly is the path of Satan and his children Pride Rebellion against God himself then you say Amen they're forward delighting in perverse things not in truth but perverse things perverse things aren't truth it's a it's a what what would you call it damaged truth or perverted Truth uh something that has been changed from the original and you say man so remember the path an individual walks down is reflected in the character the nature the actions and habits of that individual so here we find um proverbs 10 32 the lips of the righteous know what is acceptable but the mouth of the wicked speaketh's forwardness perverse things can you say man Proverbs 6 12 a naughty person a wicked man walketh with the full word mouth he weakens with his eyes he speaketh with his feet he teaches with his fingers one commentator said his mouth is perverse his eyes disguise the words his lips speak his feet and hands call attention to the things better left unnoticed for in his heart are perverse and mischievous intentions ain't that right so a Proverbs goes on forwardness is in his heart he devises Mischief continually he soweth Discord therefore shall his Calamity come suddenly suddenly shall he be broken without remedy then you say Amen so the two paths oh we've made that contrast clear tonight as we will continue on talking of this path if the musicians will come Psalms 1 and 1 101 4. a forward heart shall depart from me I will not know a wicked person now when I read that it came to me what Jesus said there in Matthew 7 and 22 that many will come unto him and say Lord Lord have we not prophesied in thy name and thy name cast out devils and in thy name done many wonderful works and his reply will be I never knew you I will not know a wicked person I never knew you depart from me you workers of iniquity and you know what the prophet said iniquity is is something that you know to do and don't you know to do it but don't you know what's right and you shun that to do something else ain't that right and if you notice Jesus goes on as he's talking about this workers of iniquity I never knew you yet they've got the credential I prophesied I spoke you know spoke in tongues I cast out Devils I've done these things many wonderful things and yet he would say no man shall enter into the kingdom of heaven that he that doeth the will of my father which is in heaven can you say Amen see there's a path there to get there there's a path and it it doesn't matter what all you do on the outward motions and signs and wonders and the devil's a Man cast out or the tongues he speaks in or the gifts that he has it does not matter if he's not walking the path of righteousness it won't take him to that destination where we hear the Lord say Well done thou good and faithful servant can you say man but you know what Isaiah 1 19 says the willing everybody say the willing and obedient shall eat the good of the land law willing and obedience not the rebellious not the proud not the stiff-necked not those that would literally walk away from the path of Truth path of righteousness to walk a way of Darkness and you say Amen and I would encourage I I would encourage you to read the second chapter of proverbs when you get home or when you have the time because here we find that we're delivered from those paths understanding discretion shall keep thee shall preserve thee from them paths can you say man oh do you love him I thought of this because in second Samuel 22 and 21 David speaks of the reward that we have for walking in the paths of righteousness he said the Lord rewarded me according to my righteousness I thought that was pretty good because now David's not talking about his own righteousness but he has led in the paths of righteousness which is God's path of righteousness can you see man and David is showing that he's walking in that path for he says it's my righteousness there is the righteousness of the Saints then you say man it's it's something that we take on it's it's it's and and so there's that reward the Lord rewarded me according to my righteousness and if you look First John 3 and 7 says little children let no man deceive you he that doeth righteousness is righteous even as he is righteous ain't that right he says here first John 2 28. if you know that he is righteous you know that everyone that doeth righteousness is born of him ain't that right first or Psalms 106 3 blessed are they that keep judgment and he that doeth righteousness at all times oh my I love the Lord do you love him so here David's saying he's rewarded me he's rewarded me to my righteousness according to my righteousness and if you look at that he goes on and he says according to the cleanness of my hands he hath recompensed me for I have kept the ways of the Lord and have not wickedly departed from my God for all his judgments were before me and as for his statutes I did not depart from them I was also upright before him and have kept myself from my iniquity therefore the Lord hath recompensed me according to my righteousness according to my cleanness in his sight oh aren't you glad for that with the mercy that Wilt show thyself merciful and with the upright man that would show thyself upright and with the pure thou Wilt show thyself pure and with the forward those who are set to disobey and oppose thou will show thyself unsavory and that word unsavory is to wrestle to struggle in other words he will show himself to the the the uh perverse the forward to be their adversary he will be their adversary not their friend their adversary but when he has come in this day to the pure he has shown himself to be pure but it showed himself to the forward to be their adversary to struggle to wrestle can you say man he becomes their opponent and I've thought of this because as the spirit of Truth is coming this day what has he done he has set himself against their religious orders he has reset set himself against their political ideas and their perversion he has set himself against their wicked ways he has condemned it he has indicted them he has blasted it can you say amen and I hear all these you know these so-called Prophets prophesying men and women prophesying revivals on the way the Lord has showed me I saw this and I saw that and and Revival's coming you ain't seen a great Revival yet the greatest Revival is yet to hear a hit uh America hit the world and and you you're going to be a part of it and and and uh the bad days are just about over with and and on and on and on they're prophesying they're prophesying and yet I can see him uh in this day as he has set himself against them to be their opponent to be their adversary and all I can see is the wrath of God Amen on being Unleashed and and and slowly it's starting to trickle out of the gates amen but when he lists them gates up the wrath of God is going to flood this place brother Brown said you don't want to be here then because he's not coming as their King he's not coming as their lord [Music] he's coming as their judge you'll be Angry Eyes Fire coming out of them eyes can you say man you'll be a god of wrath and he that is filthy let him be filthy he that is righteous let him be righteous can you say man do you love him I'm so glad that he has led us and leading Us in the paths of righteousness God bless you amen what song prisons there's nothing like the presence
