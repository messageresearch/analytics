Court down there uh the bottom of the hill and uh so if you'd like to uh come um you know we could um I don't know come around 3 in the afternoon or so or whatever don't matter but uh uh we we could

want to come uh and if you got some lawn chairs you may want to bring that as well amen and uh so uh we look forward to a a wonderful time amen uh Romans the first chapter and um I want to start at the 16th verse Paul saying here for I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ for it is the power of God un salvation to everyone that believeth to the Jew first and also to the Greek for therein is the righteousness of God revealed from Faith to Faith as it is written the just shall live by faith can you say that with me the just shall live by faith let's just bow our heads talk to the Lord father you're the one who wrote this word word it's your word father and it will forever endure but father our carnal mind can't fathom Lord the true meaning of it even though we could read it with our natural eyes that it would take you to reveal it and I pray that you would do so today father that the word could come off the pages and be so so lit in our hearts to where it it takes on flesh our flesh father we don't want to just to waste time here and we certainly don't want to waste your time but Lord as we now prepare our hearts just to hear your word we pray Lord that you would help us yield ourselves to you help me Lord just to get myself out of the way and that you would speak through the these mortal lips father to your people and Lord may we all just uh draw closer to you father and when we leave this place we had known that we had met with you may we always cherish these times we ask it in Jesus Christ's name and the church says amen amen and amen you can have your seats this morning last Sunday I had talked about uh raising our children by faith I use that title and I guess today would be a sequel to that uh but I'm going to use the the title living by faith and um you know um as Believers we are we are different from the rest of the world and uh that that also includes the religious world Amen and it's not that we tried to be different it's just God made us different and and um I I know that there is the foolish Virgin uh that is uh you know uh there and and uh as we know that the foolish virgin is made up of the same material as the bride of Christ we know that she is clean she is ho holy um and and these things but she is the remnant of the the material that goes to make the bride yeah um and brother Brandon talked of that of how um that that you know the seamstress You Know She lays out her patter uh the the material and then she selects a certain place in that material and then She lays her pattern out of the dress she wants to make or whatever and then she begins to cut that that pattern that that material according to the pattern and when she gets it cut then there's that remaining part it's still the same material but it's uh set aside because for another time as the prophet would say because uh she's working on the the material that that she's cut out is what she's working on now to fit the pattern and so uh we we know that the wise virgin is is the the one that has been cut out to fit the pattern she's the one that God is working with now and uh as we know the foolish virgin will have to go through the tribulation uh because she has rejected the atonement in its fullness and so she didn't have the faith to go all the way uh there but as the bride of Christ uh uh there is a faith that is not found in any other uh uh uh group of people uh and so we we walk by faith and not by sight everything that we do uh is by faith we are to to walk by faith and if we are to walk by faith then everything that we do must be by faith we sing by faith we worship by faith we pray by faith we preach by faith we we uh uh make confession on the Promises of God by faith uh we we make our choices by faith or uh uh anyone from from you young people to to the eldest uh any any decision that you make it must be by faith uh uh uh there and and then when we fall as as we know that we you will fall you make mistakes but by faith you get back up and and you keep pressing on by faith it's everything about the the Christian Life or I would say the bride's life is is faith we we walk by faith and so we we don't do any of these things preach sing worship um uh uh live moral life what whatever we we don't do these things by a Creed or a Dogma we don't do it by a set of rules it's it's simply by faith that we do these things and so then then as parenting as well we raise our children by faith it everything about our lives is is by faith and so any individual who walks by faith is considered to to be absolutely crazy uh uh uh to in in the eyes of the world and and that's because uh the believer doesn't walk by sight nor does he go by his own intuition he he doesn't go by what he thinks and he doesn't go by his feelings or uh his Sensations or anything like that he just simply walks by faith and and and you'll find the the the more you you become dependent upon faith and you you simply walk by faith then you become so strange to to the world but but he is he is what God calls a Believer uh believers do not consider anything that's negative to what they are confessing in in their confession and and the Believers have a positive confession they have a positive outlook have a positive that's that's what it means by walking by faith and and not because we're we're strong mentally or we're strong uh uh whatever and so we have this uh uh will to endure it it has nothing to do with that it's simply because there's a faith within the believer that that he sees something different than what the world sees uh he his Outlook is totally different and so now one might consider the the believer to be gullible and and easily deceived uh uh Etc but that's not the case at all in fact a a Believer is actually more sound than anyone else in the world a a Believer his life is more sound his his testimony is more sound his confession is more sound e everything about him is more sound because he he doesn't build his life up on shifting Sands he's he's not built his testimony uh uh on emotions and Sensations and how he feels and and all of these things we as believers do not build our hope uh uh upon things that that that just come and go and and all these things so the believer doesn't pay any attention to the negative that's within him or around him and and all of us tonight or today there there are plenty of negative things about our life and and if God would would put a microscope on our lives and and magnify it we'd all be ashamed and embarrassed and and these things because we all deal with negatives in our life but as Believers we do not look at the negatives whether it's in our lives or the negative that is surrounding us amen and and so it's not that we we uh um uh deny the negative uh uh because we can all readily agree that there is negative uh and this is what the devil uses against us is the negatives of our lives and and so we're very much well aware of of negativity uh around us in us a part of us and and all these things and so we we we do as Believers acknowledge it to a degree that it is the there and this is what keeps us um uh humble this is what keeps us uh uh persevering and not becoming complacent and and and these things but a a Believer doesn't let the negative dictate his confession amen uh he doesn't let the neg negative in his life around him dictate his worship the way he worships and and how he worships and and and these things the negative doesn't change the believer in how he views the promises of God can you say say Amen see it's the believer that is as Paul would say grounded settled steadfast unmovable because he has faith not because he has willpower he has Faith Can you say amen and and you could be the most weakest uh individual and and and and look like in a pushover but if you ever have faith then Satan will never be able to push you around and dictate you uh uh because uh faith is stronger than Satan and and his his his power or anything like that and and so uh um as Paul would say that that as the believer we apprehending that for which I have been apprehended for or of Jesus Christ amen we we're we're we're constantly apprehending we're another place Paul would say reaching for to those things uh which are before I I I press I I I press toward the mark of the High Calling Not Looking Back not considering so there's things about a Christian's life that yes he is Mortal yes he is human yes he has mistakes yes he has challenges yes he has battles and yes he goes through tests and trials but he never looks at those things he's there because of Faith he lives by faith amen and so uh um uh the faith that we live by is of course the faith of God this is what Jesus told us have have faith in God and and as we know that that is is interpreted in Greek as have the faith of God Amen so this is God's own faith that makes a Believer to POS to be a believer uh is to possess God's own faith not just a faith but God's Own Faith amen and and and so by faith God created the world as we know in other words he he he saw the world he saw think of that he saw the world before he ever created it he saw the world in existence he saw what he wanted and what he was after before he even created amen see it was because he had Faith ain't that right amen and also by faith God saw a lamb a man uh slain for the Redemption of man before the foundation of the world and that was by faith he he could actually see it and he decreed it to be so amen see he done this by faith so when when Adam fell in sin and it and it looked like it was so contrary I mean the holy image of God them uh he fell from his his rightful place uh he become perverted in his mind he he become carnal in his mind he become an enemy against uh to God and and and never now now his understanding of God Amen was was now diminished and and he acted like a a beast and uh just a brute beast and and and these things uh because brother brah says a man without the Holy Ghost is nothing more than just a brute Beast so so he fa and what a condition he fell and and now we're seeing in this day just how Fallen he really became and and and who who would think that man would be the way they are today but that never moved God it it never moved God because God by faith saw uh uh all the way to the end and he had declared what man was to be can you say Amen so so God never moved he had Faith amen so the conditions of man never there ever wavered the when he called Israel and ordained Israel amen and and called them to be his his people and they they up and down up and down up and down they they they they had you know he would bring them back in line and then they'd backslide then he'd bring them back and he had they' backslide they'd go into that captivity he'd bring them out and they'd go right back in and he you know and and he would tell them you know only serve one God then they found out they you know then the next thing they're many gods and and on and on but it never moved God Amen because by faith he lived by faith can you say amen amen see so God ain't going to ask you to do something if he ain't going to do it can you say amen that's right see so so God is never moved by World conditions he has never moved amen by by your feelings by your Sensations he he he he ain't moved he's got faith amen the faith of God amen see and and so if your name see because by faith God wrote every name that would be redeemed in the Lamb's Book of Life do you realize he saw you before the foundation of the world see he had Faith amen and so he wrote your name in the Lamb's Book of Life and if your name is written in there then God foresaw you amen and by faith he fornew you he called you he justified ified you and he already what glorified you can you say amen he could do that by faith before it ever become a reality before here you are you're coming into the thing that he's already called you that he could do it by faith amen it's it's it's all by faith so he wasn't bothered and uh uh at the fact that you came into this world a sinner he wasn't bothered by the the life that you lived as as a sinner amen uh uh uh because by faith he already decreed you and he still lives by that Faith he sees you by his faith can you say amen he what he has declared you to be by faith he's still that's that's what he sees you as can you say Amen so so then he he lives by faith and so his faith exists now notice his faith exists by him knowing who he is and what he is capable of so it's not like we would be that would say well I I want I I want I want to have an a nice you know a nice house and or I I want to do this and I want to do that but then we find within ourselves limitations amen that we can't we cannot make that happen but that's not God God knows who he is God God knows that he is able to do it and not only is is he able to do it he's determined to do it he determined to have a bride without spot or wrinkle or blemish before the foundation of the world and he knew that there was nothing greater than him there would be no sin greater so he could allow Satan to do whatever he wanted to do even bring us in into into the most uh demoral situation of life that could ever be and yet God knew amen by his faith he could raise you up amen and bring you back to a son and daughter of God he he knows that can you sayen see so his faith exists but knowing who he is and what he is capable of and knowing that when he speaks his word it will never fail because he stands behind his own word ain't that right so then there's no need for him to fall apart uh when he knows that he's able to redeem you there there's no need for him to fall apart when he knows he's able to heal you name the worst name the worst possible situation whether it be disease whether it be uh uh uh what whatever it would be uh a sin or or whatever and yet God never falls apart when you're going through it cuz he knows he's able Amen to restore you can you say Amen so therefore if we know that he's able to do it we know that whatever we're facing is is not a problem to God then we have to rely on his Sovereign will will that God has a plan for this can you say Amen it's not that Satan has defeated God it's not that Satan has put God in Checkmate and now God is trying to figure another plan on how to help us God God's got it all taken care of by faith he has done this can you say Amen see and so his faith is founded in himself knowing that he will do as he pleases is that not what the Bible says that he does what ever he pleases in the heavens and in the earth and he's the one that controls the hearts of men he's the he controls the the the the the Kings he controls Nations he's he's ah head of it all yes the these kingdoms are set up by Satan and all these things but Satan will never ever ever ever get the upper hand on God Amen look at King Nebuchadnezzar he tried it amen he tried to destroy God's children but he can never do it amen for God stepped in the fire and took the heat out of the fire he tried to destroy the Prophet Daniel in the Lion's Den but God stepped in right in time and shut the M the the mouths of the Lions see God is able to do whatever he wants to see so his faith again his faith is founded in himself nothing outside of himself God's faith is not based upon you it's not founded in you he knows what you are he knows you're nothing without him can you say Amen so his faith is settled in him he's established himself his faith in himself he knew that his hand is not shortened that it cannot save he knew that there is none that can stay his hand he knew that once he speaks the word amen his word it will not return unto him void but it shall accomplish where unto he sent it ain't that right that's what the Bible says see so in his mind he saw the end from the beginning so he's not just planning on a day-by-day basis like we do or we may even plan a year out and yet we don't know if we're ever going to get there things may fall apart we have to cancel plans amen we have to do something else we have to go to plan B plan C sometime plan Z you know but but it's because we don't have the power Amen to make things happen we just go day by day and and and as the prophet told us we should always say if the Lord will if I'm going to do this if the Lord will ain't that right but God doesn't have to do that he saw the end from the beginning he decreed the end from the beginning and he done it by his faith can you say amen and so by faith he decreed it to be so and by faith he entered into rest now see now now think of it this is God's faith and he shows us what can be done by faith his faith and and and how he the the the how how the the results that his faith brings he rests he rests he's not struggling with you brother Bill he's not struggling with me he's not struggling brother Jordan wondering if you're going to make it he's already decreed it and by faith he's entered into a rest can you say Amen see now notice now the the the that same faith is expressed in the elect of God that that same faith is expressed in the elect and see so this Faith only anchors itself in the word of God now if you're trusting in yourself you've got the wrong faith if you're trusting in the preacher you've got the wrong Faith amen for this faith that God had could only come and find its existence in himself can you say Amen so then this faith that we have of of that is the faith of God it is now resting in him amen we're not looking to our elves we're not looking to our abilities we're not looking whether amen we feel like achieving or whether we don't feel like achieve sometimes we feel like we're you know we feel like pressing on other time we don't feel like pressing on sometimes we think all right we got this Whip and other times we wondering God where are you at right see but faith faith amen endures Faith keeps it in in God's hands trusting in God and not ourselves now so this Faith only acors itself in the word of God it does not believe in myths nor does it rely on gimmicks it doesn't believe in anything outside of God's word can you say amen and what God has in his word is nothing but promises that's right so it does not rely on anything outside what God has promised for this age can you say Amen this Faith feeds off the word of God that's why we love to come to church to hear the word that's why we love to play the messages amen throughout the day this is God God has given us the opportunity Amen to play the tapes throughout the day God's given us the opportunity bless the name of the Lord As Americans to be able to come freely to worship God and and to learn of him why Faith feeds off the word when you come when you when you when you just well brother Brown said when you stay home from church you you cannot you cannot remain the same Christian in in a strong Christian you you just can't do it and so so then then we find amen that Faith feeds off the word of God and notice it doesn't look for anything else because it doesn't need anything else talking about the faith of God now so here God decrees it God by his faith decreed a world now he didn't look for someone else to make that world happen he didn't look for confirmation outside of himself you say well there wasn't anybody there exactly his faith stemmed from who he was then that means he's still not looking to you to confirm him he's not looking for this church to confirm him he's not look we're just here because he decreed it by his faith can you say Amen so then therefore if we possess the same faith we are totally relying upon thus say the Lord we we this is why we feed off the word of God and we're not looking for confirmation from everybody else Amen to let us know that we're going to make it God said we're going to make it that's the faith we live [Music] by see the faith of God is satisfied in the word of God and that's what a Bel ver is he's satisfied how many satisfied satisfied in the word of God satisfied in what God has promised that's right see and so this is why believers do not follow impersonations if it doesn't line up with the word of God they don't want it they don't believe it you can call a snub snobs you know uh narrow-minded all you want to but the faith of God doesn't look for crutches the Faith Of God doesn't look for anything else it is So Satisfied in the promise of God for them that's right can you say Amen now people who simply don't have faith or their faith hasn't fully developed then they need those kinds of things to help them along they they need an assurance you're going to make it keep on keep pressing on you got it see and and and and I'm not talking about just encouragement we all could use encouragement we God sends encouragement our way and and and these things and and and I think I I I thank God for that amen but we we we we don't need them things see we're brother brandom would call it rugged Faith rugged Christians where you don't have to be babied and pampered and and all of these things you're you're able to actually stand on your own two feet now Church we're coming to this place where the world is turning against us we are becoming more odd by by by the day we are becoming more of the elite or or uh what what what do they call that when when the animals are about gone and and extinct We are Becoming just about extinct if it had not if it's not have have not been for the grace of God I hope you understand there's plans Satan's got plans out there to destroy us he is trying his best to destroy us but what keeps us standing there is a faith in God's word what keeps us from falling apart faith in God's word God say there's no weapon formed against me that can prosper did he not say that well then that's all I need that's right but see people whose faith is anchored in the word of God simply believe what God Said So they believe when things are going good they still believe when things are going bad they believe when the sun is shining they believe when the rain is when it's storming they they they they believe can you say Amen they believe when they ain't got the money amen for things and and yet they believe when they do have money they believe when they feel good they believe when they don't feel good it it's a faith it's a faith God doesn't look at the world the the conditions of this world does not dictate the faith of God God he settled are you with me heavens and earth will pass away but my word will never pass away that's what his faith is anchored in amen come on now yeah so Faith causes the believer to endure that word endure means to hold out so God would challenge different Believers to give us the example Abraham 25 years but he held out prise the Lord he endured right Noah preached 120 years but he held out ain't that right on and on and on he that's why he would promise the the the the the the coming Messiah amen right at the very beginning and how many 4,000 years and there was an elect still holding out still holding out still enduring looking to the promise looking to the promise Why by faith that's right by faith amen see so Faith causes the believer to endure Faith keeps Believers from jumping ship yeah when the going gets tough brother Braham says see Faith doesn't move no matter how contrary it looks I want to say that again no matter how contrary it looks on faith stays right there it never moves now this Faith the faith of God is not blind it's it's not you you probably heard of the phrase Blind Faith and and I looked it up Blind Faith is an is an unquestioning belief in something never questioning just simply believing it even when it's unreasonable or wrong it's also known as delusion Blind Faith So Blind Faith just accepts anything anything anything anything anything not not questioning not questioning is this of God or not because see again the faith of God only relies upon the word of God can you say Amen so so it doesn't seek to see it just unquestioning accepts it it's gullible can you say amen and sad to say millions of people just have this Blind Faith and they will accept most anything without question this is why the Jim Jones and the David cores and and and and and and all this other has followings is because people blindly just blindly without question without caring it they just blindly walk into the Trap and and and and you know Jesus called them blind leaders of the blind can you say Amen but a real believer doesn't have Blind Faith for the faith that he actually has sees do you believe that see God didn't do this by Blind Faith he s you come on now ain't that right brother brandham called it the eye of Faith yeah in other words see this Faith sees things that the natural eye cannot see amen it's a super sense it it it sees it now if you see it then you know it you see it existent right so see your salvation was more more real to God than you being a sinner because that's what he saw you as is a saint he saw you redeemed he saw you can you say Amen he's already got a body waiting for you he saw you by faith so it wasn't a blind faith well I'm going to pick him and I'm going to choose this but you know let's see what he comes that like no he already knows what you're going to be because he decreed it he sees you he sees you not now the way you are he sees you what you are what he's already decreed you to be that's exactly right well what keeps him from seeing us right now the [Applause] blood that's what brother brandom said he cannot see you he sees the blood he hears your voice but he sees the blood ain't that right and red through red makes what white though your sins be as Scarlet will be white as snow can you say amen that's right see and so uh uh we find that a real believer actually sees it's it's the eye of Faith so so then this eye of Faith actually sees things that this natural eye cannot see amen amen that's why we live by faith come on now and you say Amen see it knows things that the the natural mind cannot know yeah right hello so you could be feeling your worst worst ever and you could still come to church lifting up your hands praising God well what would make you do that is because by faith you live you're seeing something you you you're in the darkest of our but you're seeing the light shining on the other side of it you know God is there with you but even though you feel like he's not there but by faith you know he's there amen so it is a super sense that supersedes the natural senses that we have if you if you didn't have the natural sense of sight then you would not be able to tell what's in the room right you wouldn't even be able to tell except if you were able to distinguish the voices yeah who's in the room ain't that right that's right but if you did have the natural sense of hearing then you wouldn't be able to tell the the kind of noise that is sounding in the room ain't that right thank God for natural sense and and by our natural sense it becomes a reality I I don't I don't I I don't have to wonder if sister Brenda is here this morning because I see her and so I don't go around questioning is sister Brenda here did she make it no my own eyes ver bear witness that she's here now that's the natural so that I'm at rest she's here anyone that would tell me she's not here anyone would say well sister Brenda didn't make it I'd have to say well no my eye ain't didn't play tricks I saw her not only that I heard her you understand what I'm saying see it it becomes a knowing to me it becomes something solid to me it becomes a guarantee an assurance to me a ain't that right that's right see someone you know uh uh our visitors the uh other night come in and and and and some of them said well I didn't see the the the gentleman I I I didn't see him and I could say but he was there cuz I saw him he he he was in the room well I didn't see him well I I don't that that's fine but but but you ain't going to tell me you that don't shake me in the fact that he wasn't there I saw him for myself can you say Amen see so we're not living by somebody else's experience we living by a faith that we have it's our eyesight it's declaring to us the things that cannot be seen by this natural eye that's right amen you see if you didn't have faith that eye of faith that super sense you you wouldn't know that there's the Unseen God and angels all around us right now amen hello right if if you didn't have this eye of Faith then you wouldn't be able to look beyond the natural and see the promises of God so then everything around you would dictate your life if the sun is shining it would dictate you if the clouds were there it would dictate you everything about your life whether you're you're you're going through something or or all of these things but by the eye of Faith then we become more assured and that rest knowing I don't care what it says that's devil says well you're not going to make it but by the eye of faith I see myself there Hebrews 11:6 it says he that cometh to God must believe that he is amen so in other words you must see that he is don't learn about just Ju Just learn about God see that he is amen can you say amen that's the only way to come to God God I I'm I'm needing help if if if you could just help me I I know I could make it you're not coming to God right you have to see that he's able well God if you really love me you know I I just feel so alone if if you just love me and and show me your love and and I I really don't know you're you're not coming right you're coming by wishes God I wish I could be better I I just wished I I just wished I could be what you want me to be I I don't know I I I just you know you know what that'll dictate your worship every time instead of having hands lifted up it's head hanging down come on now yeah I don't know hello yeah but when you come to God believing that he is then you that means you see that he is can you say amen that's right so see that that's the faith that the believer has he knows that God is present tense he knows that God is alive and well he knows that God is all powerful he knows that God is omniscient he knows that God is s Sovereign he knows that God is greater than any situation that he's going through he he knows that God is a way maker can you say Amen see faith is what causes us to ask for big things because that's what God has promised us is big things so our prayer doesn't should not should not be tampered by our complexes our prayer should not be uh tempered and and limited amen by our feelings and our emotions and all these things we must believe that God is well what is what is the god that you're serving tonight or today come on Church what is the god well oh oh well he's he's he's Mr Trump he's the one that's promised this world peace right come on well well we we get our satisfaction in in in in some basketball player the team that we're rooting for because they win really but we can't find a peace in prayer knowing that that that that when we call upon him he is listening to usall can you say Amen see so so to to believe that God is is to know that God is able to keep his word and that he is determined not only able but he's determined to fulfill every promise that he's made can you say Amen he that come unto God believes that God is faithful to his word living by faith amen hallelujah this is the faith that we live by by the eye of faith we see what God has promised for this day well how do we see it then it's by Revelation amen are you with me it's it's by Revelation faith is a revelation the prophet said so revelation is an act of revealing to view see taking off the cover taking off the what is veiling it take unveiling it so that we can view it and and it's a making known it's an unveiling of something ain't that right see and and so then then then then before the Revelation came it couldn't be seen everybody pre probing at it wishing and and wondering what it is and don't really know how can you pray to a god that you don't really know how can you pray and ask for things that you really don't know if it's available to you but see when the unveiling is is is taken is takes place the Revelation comes Lord you know brother Brandon said if we lose Faith all our spiritual reality is gone I'll say that again if we lose faith if if if it it it it it just like you if you lose your eyesight if you lose your hearing then the reality of of what's around you is gone you won't know if they're in the room or out of the room you wouldn't know who is here and who isn't here see then then it becomes a a a question but when faith comes and and and so if we lose that super sense if we lose that sense of Faith then the spiritual reality of Heaven and the blessings and the promises of God are gone it's lost to us it brother brah said you cannot have faith in things that you see talking about the natural life for the things that you see are all perishable do you believe that money is perishable materialistic things are perishable everything that we you do not build your hopes up on this life and expect to get through life and I say that to you young people you can build dreams and all that and and and good for your dreams but but but but don't live by those dreams live by faith live by faith cuz circumstances will change you can have your all the Ducks lined up in a row and and have everything just planned and and something just comes and shatters that live by faith amen sir can you say amen he said if we look at some great person or great minister or great congregation they will all perish someday if we look at a great nation or a great weapon they'll all perish someday and then we must we must everybody say we must live by faith of those things that science does not declare it's by faith that we believe now we lose our Glory if we lose faith if we get away from Faith then we take the church into an intellectual Rim then we're trying to reason how it can happen and how it can be and we're trying to make it all work and and line up before we can believe we don't want intellectual faith we want a faith of God that can actually see it and make it real to us make it positive to us and know that it puts our heart at rest your salvation is positive not because you came to an altar it was positive before you ever was born by faith God lived it by faith God saw it it was a Revelation to him and you can't take it out of God's mind that's right no sin can take it out of God's mind no situation can take it out of God's mind even to the fact that if you were to to die burned alive or if you were to drown and and and your ashes scattered through the four corners of the world it'll World it'll never take that picture out of God's mind it's by faith he lives that's right amen I hope it all right you see Revelation is a Divine truth everybody say a Divine truth div trth revealed by God thus Faith Comes Revelation is not your idea it's not what you come up with it's a Divine truth that only is revealed by God thus Faith Comes his Revelation that he had of you now strikes your soul his revelation of a bride for this date now strikes your soul can you say amen amen now you take on the mind of God now you see as God sees it you confess as God confesses it's by faith we live by faith you see it takes it to be from God before faith can come because Abraham would not have had the faith that he had if God would not have revealed to him that's right his future if God did not reveal to him that his seat would possess the gates of his enemies right before he even had a seat yeah to the Natural it was impossible for him to have a seat but God revealed it to him therefore Abraham never looked at his situation he never looked to Sarah at her situation he never expected Sarah to come up with something he never come expected himself the pressure was lit off of him because by Revelation he could see the sun amen 25 years but he kept watching him am he could see it am the world made fun of him because he they couldn't see it because they were looking by natural eye where's your son never moved Abraham he could see it by Revelation he knew it was coming am that's it's true can you say Amen yep he saw the sun he saw the sun before the world ever saw it therefore by his faith he called those things that are not as though they were can you say amen amen he called those things that are not though they were I was just listening to brother brandham this morning and he was talking about how that he was praying and thanking God for for a man like Joseph yeah in the Bible he's reading about Joseph and he just got to thanking God for a man like Joseph and he said it wasn't a vision it was just something spoke to his heart a revelation you shall have a son and you shall call him Joseph how many years did he go four five many years going to have a Joseph he went around telling the world going to have have a son named Joseph wife got got to exp him is that going to be Joseph I don't know but I'm going to have a Joseph right and and and he says you know then then Sarah was born everybody started making fun of him he said his own flesh Brothers start well then you know I thought you said that the the the prophecies were always right they are right well well but but you didn't have Joseph I didn't say when I was going to have Joseph I'm going to have Joseph right and then someone says well maybe it was Josephine you meant no no it was Joseph and and and and people started making fun of him and all that but see what he saw he declared can you say amen he didn't need confirmation he didn't need the doctor to say oh you got a boy no no God had already showed him and he could see Joseph before the world ever saw him never moved him doctor says oh you better tie her tubes up she ain't ain't going no no she it's by her going to have a boy she going to die I don't care she's going to have a boy I don't know how it's all going to work out I already see Joseph coming then you say Amen because it was a revelation he lived by faith so he called Abraham called those things that were not as though they were the Amplified says he spoke of the non-existent things that God had foretold and promised as if they had already existed think of that now now that makes us crazy right how can we speak of us being there when we're not there how can we speak of a body change as though we're already there how can we speak of being in a Rapture as and and yet here we are in this body of Shame amen we're speaking of things that do not exist yeah but yet we see see them by Faith by faith that's the same way with your healing people say well I I don't feel any different so I'm ashamed I I probably shouldn't say anything cuz it make me act crazy if you really got the faith of God you'll express your healing before it ever happens why because your healing is real to you it don't have to be real to the world it don't even have to uh be real to your own body but by faith you see yourself healed therefore you declare you're healing I am healed it's like that the blind man John out on the streets extra extra read all about it thank God I'm Healed what was it he could see it that's can you say amen he was confessing something that wasn't even in existence to the world and the world would make fun of him and they would jab at him and and all of these things the barber you know that final time the last Jab I heard you went to a holy ghost meeting yes I did I heard you got prayed for yes I did I heard you can you're saying around here that you can see yep yep well you can see oh thank God I can see and the scales come off his eyes it become a reality can you say Amen see but the confession is what made Abraham crazy to the world but he could see it when they couldn't Bible says Abraham against hope believe in Hope ain't that right humanly speaking scientifically speaking medical speaking it was totally impossible there was no hope at all but by faith he believed in Hope then what where did that hope come from the promise of God the hope we're not a hopeless people amen are you with me church you can go through the biggest trial of your life but you're not hopeless the promise gives you hope if you could just look beyond the natural and see the Promise for you then against hope you'll believe in hope that's can you say Amen the Bible says he staggered not at the promise of God but was strong in faith his body grew weaker but he was stronger in faith his body showed more signs of negativity but he was strong in faith can you say amen he never lost vision of the promise that promise never lost its reality to Abraham the sun was just as real as though it was right there in Flesh and Blood that's right Lord now brother Brown said he was like God he had a part of God in him for he believed and you say amen he was like God Abraham was like God for he had a part of God in him for he believed to have the faith of God is to have the nature of God to have the divine nature of God humanly possible you can't have have the faith of God but when God imparts himself in you now you have his divine nature you have his Divine character you have his Divine [Music] word therefore when God speaks a word it comes as a re Revelation to the one it is intended for you see God didn't speak his word in this day just for men to wander about it and to fuss over it amen there's many men women boys girls just argue about the message of the hour fuss about the me message of the hour trying to prove it's right but here is an elect God sent that word to the elect just like he sent it he he sent it to Abraham he sent it to Noah he sent it to all the the the the Saints of old and he sends that word to the elect of this age amen for them to Anchor their soul in am and to believe it regardless of the condition yes can you say Amen see the word came as a revelation to the elect see so it's it's to a certain group of people the Revelation came to Abel not to Cain it came to lot or Abraham not lot it came to moses' parents and not to the others and you say amen and it caused them all to act different caused Abraham to act act different than lot caused Noah to act different from the rest of the world why because they were seeing something that the rest can't see it caused Moses's parents to to act different than the others that's right they knew the promise was here they knew it was time for deliverance can you say Amen by faith they could see it they Liv by that Faith Can you say amen and I say to you the Revelation has come to us in this day yes sir let the world fuss about it and argue over it and deny it and and say well this message is just a sham and and all of these things but it's a revelation to US 1 Corinthians 2:9 but as it is written I have not seen nor ear heard neither have entered into the heart of man the things which God hath prepared for them that love him but God hath revealed them to us by his spirit for the spirit searcheth all things yay the Deep things of God see so there is a people in this day that is rising up in faith for something has been revealed to them that they're now seeing things that that no man can ever see for what man knoweth the things of a man say the spirit of man which is in him even so the things of God knoweth no man but the spirit of God now we have not received uh we have received not the spirit of the world but the spirit which is of god that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God can you say Amen now notice the Revelation that the believer receives lines up with the word of God we're not interested in just any man's revelation we want that Revelation that comes from the scriptures and then it's Vindicated to let us know that the Revelation came from God not from man theologians have read this Bible forever and try to tell us how this how this what this Bible means right but it was never backed up or Vindicated but God come in this age through a prophet of the age Lord can you say Amen yes sir see so therefore this is how Faith Comes the Revelation lines up with the written word of God Revelations or Romans 10:17 so then Faith cometh by hearing that word means uh hearing is understanding or Revelation see Faith cometh by understanding Revelation by hearing and hearing by the word of God by the word of God not some Creed not some idea can you say Amen not a Pentecostal idea not a Baptist idea ain't that right not my idea not your idea see brother brah said faith is something that's revealed to you that is not yet but you believe it will be how many believes it it will be that's we live by faith we believe by faith that's right yes sir it will be it will Beall don't base your decisions young people on your ex discouragement base your decisions by faith it will be I may not see it today I may not feel it today but it will be for by the eye of faith it exists in my view it exists it exists it exists prise the Lord hallelujah see we're not making things up these things are actually revealed to us ain't that right so we're not hoping that it's going to be and therefore act like it's going to be we know it's going to be and confess that it is can you say amen for God has actually revealed his word to us now see Moses parents and I get ready to close but Moses parents had this same kind of faith of God see Hebrews 11:23 by faith Moses when he was born was HD three months of his parents because they saw that he was a proper child and they were not afraid of the king's commandment now you know the prophet said when fear is gone faith is perfect when fear is gone faith is perfect Lord they were not afraid of the king's commandment so therefore they did not allow themselves suppos to be dictated by by fear of what that King had decreed death was all around them but they live by faith not by what a king decreed they live by faith can you say amen that's right by faith they saw that he was for ordained of God to be delivered to the children of Israel see it was revealed to them and the Revelation notice that they received lined up with the scriptures yeah it was according to the promise that God gave Abraham Lord can you say amen and they would have never had that type of Faith had not it been revealed to them all right they would have been just like everybody else and and shaken by the fear by the com the the with fear of the of the king's Commandments of what that King decreed but God revealed to them something different the king had determined to kill him but they knew different because they could see Moses as a deliverer can you say Amen yes sir they could see nothing else but a deliverer prise the Lord they look at a dead baby think of it if they feared what Pharaoh said about him they would have been looking at wondering this could be his last breath this could be any moment any moment they didn't fear because they saw a deliverer the king's commandment could never take that from him them what they saw they saw not in existence at that time but they saw it by faith and knew it by Faith Lord now notice Revelations 10:7 but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished as he ha declared to his servants the prophets amen now just reading quotes that we all know that the seventh angel brother BR said winds up all the Loose Ends that these fellas probed at and the mystery comes down from God as the word of God and reveals the entire revelation of God can you say Amen now now in this revelation of God you can't help but see yourself right cuz you're part of God yeah can you say Amen you're just as much as part of him as Eve was to Adam praise the Lord hallelujah so this Revelation that comes from that seven Angel reveals the mysteries of God then the godhead and everything else is settled all the Mysteries serpent seed and whatever more is to be revealed another place at the sounding of this seventh Church age this last Church age all the Luc ends that through these Church ages have been probed out will be wound up to together when the seals are broke the mystery is revealed down comes the angel the mighty angel of Revelations 10:1 the messenger Christ setting his foot upon the land and upon the sea with a rainbow over his head now remember the seventh angel is on Earth at the time of this coming another place the first thing that represented that Redemption come the lamb that had been slain from the foundation of the world he took the book opened the book tore off the seals and it down to the Earth to a seventh angel to reveal it to his people are you with me now no Theologian no Bishop nothing else no doct so and so has been given that authority to take off the covering of what God wanted to reveal to the people this revealing comes through the message of the hour Lord can you say Amen why because God's going to give that people Faith he's going to give his people Faith so through the message of the hour we see something that the world don't see wonderful it comes through the to through the seventh angel now what is it he says the complete revelation of Jesus Christ everybody say the complete revelation of Jesus Christ is now made known to the church amen we don't need to seven and eighth eighth messenger hello we don't need some personality we don't need some gimmic anything else it's it's over with the revelation of Jesus Christ the complete revelation of Jesus Christ is now made known to the church am now in this Revelation in the opening of the word is the revelation of of our name written in the book before the foundation of the world prise the lord Revelations 51 and I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the backside sealed with Seven Seals and I saw a strange angel or strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice who is worthy to open the book and to loose the seals thereof no man in Heaven Nor in Earth neither under the Earth was able to open the book neither to look thereon and I wept much because no man was found worthy to open and to read the book neither to look thereon and one of the elders saith unto me weep not Behold The Lion of the tribe of Judah the root of David hath prevailed to open the book and to loose the seals thereof and I beheld and lo in the midst of the the throne and of the four beasts and in the midst of the Elder stood a lamb as it had been slain having seven horns seven eyes which are the seven spirits of God sent forth into all the Earth and he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne and when he had taken the book The Four beast and 4 and 20 Elders fell down before the lamb having every one of them Harps and golden vials full of oders which are the prayers of the Saints and they sung a new song See saying Thou Art wory to take the book and to open the seals thereof for thou was slain and H has redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every Kindred tongue people and nation and has made us what a revelation now is coming forth H has made us Kings and Priests and we shall reign upon the Earth can you say Amen it's a revelation they're seeing something by faith see and I beheld and I heard the voice of many angels round about the throne and the Beast and the elders and the number of them was 10,000 times 10 thousands and thousands of thousands and saying with a loud voice Worthy is the Lamb that was slain to receive power riches wisdom strength and honor and glory and blessing and every creature which is in heaven and on the earth under the Earth and such as are in the sea and all that are in uh in them heard I see saying blessing and honor and glory and power be unto him that sth upon the throne and unto the lamb forever and ever ain't that right so the brother Ram talking about this scripture he says what a jubilee going on in heaven that when the lamb leaves the that intercessory body here to come here to possess his claim you know that got next to John he must have saw his name wrot there what a revelation he saw himself there he saw himself redeemed he saw himself saved he saw himself already secured amen can you say amen he must have saw his name wrot there when them seals broke he must have got real happy another place John must have looked in and saw a past the curtain of time and said there's John there's me living by faith I believe brother Ram said God's great mystery what the Eternal God had as a mystery has now been unfolded in Jesus Christ then given right down to his church what once was once in God's mind is now in the body of Christ Jesus making love to the church his bride Whispering secrets to her he said you know how you tell your wife things you know the little girl you're going to marry you love her so much you just tell her the secrets and get her up next to you and love her and everything you know how it is see well that's what God Christ is doing to the church he is letting her know the secrets hello hallelujah what is it faith is now coming alive in the church by him revealing the secrets to her amen come on now praise the Lord now notice he he says just the secrets not these flirters I mean his wife he said all right now look no he says by having the revelation of his secret made known to them see by his grace how the grace of God people he says I hope you know uh you don't think this sounds personal to a bunch of people or this that but the secret that God is sharing with the whole church if they would just receive it doesn't mean just me or just you it means the church he's trying to get into it can you say amen and I say to you you don't need a personal word from the Lord when the lamb has opened the book in this day and is trying to reveal it to his entire church you don't need to have some Vision or some experience to go to heaven amen just to see your name written there the Revelation is coming through the message of the hour it's the message that God through the message is God revealing the secrets to the church Hallelujah well I wonder if God loves me I just I just wonder I I wonder if I'm going to make it well you don't need someone to prophesy over you telling you you're going to make it it's right hearing the word you just need God to reveal it to you Amen on it's true anyways Lord you just need a revelation of what is written in the word and you cannot buy the the bypass the prophet and have an understanding of this word it's been closed up the greatest minds of this Bible can even couldn't even understand it and still can't today it comes by the message of the hour can you say Amen every promise can you say that with me every promise has been revealed revealed by the seventh angel every promise has been revealed by the seventh angel that's exactly right can you say amen and this message is the Joshua minist his that not only took the people into the promised land but showed them the promises and placed them in the promise in their inheritance can you say amen amen by faith yes sir we live by faith good amen now the Revelation that makes it known to us this is why brother brandham said pray for Revelation for re pray for Revelation oh if if if I could just set under minister so and so no just pray for Revelation oh but if I could just do this and if I could just do this if someone just prophesy over me and I I'd feel you know that's the way it was in Pentecost we we we just on you on an emotional roller coaster you know some some guy that was supposed to be a Prophet come in we just oh God if You' just call me out I know you love me you know I I just know if you call me out I know I'm going to make it you know well then if he didn't call you out then what are you going to do you know it's like rubbing the rabbit's foot you know you just trying to wish for luck and all these things see but but when the message of the hour has come then then you don't need those things you now you become you just need the revelation of what God has been whispering all along to his church these are love secrets that's right why why why would we want something else brother Braham said a prophet never had to stand before a judge to be judged yeah are you with me yeah come on Isaiah never had to stand before anyone to be judged of them why he had the word of the Lord he just spoke thus say the Lord it happened it didn't take didn't matter how long it it took there's some of his stuff prophecies that are still yet to be uh uh uh uh fulfilled speaking of the the Millennium and stuff prise the Lord but but he never stood but every a a a a a dream has to be judged right right if if if it if it's all in symbols it takes a prophet to to to to reveal the dream if a prophet ain't there God ain't going to give dreams and symbols it's just the facts it's that way the message taught can you say amen and then if if a gift of Prophecy Goes Forth an interpretation is not to be received the church is not to receive it unless it's judged by two or three Witnesses and them Witnesses has to be credible they have to be proven so why would we want to base our our faith in them things hello I believe in gifts I believe in Prophecy I believe in them things but brother Brown tells us what it's supposed to be you know he says you know prophecy comes forth interpretation and says Mr Jones there's a tornado coming to your house tomorrow at 2:00 make sure you're not there get your house in order make sure you're not there and then tornado just sure enough just wipes the house or whatever and the church all comes together brother Jones is there at the church and they're all excited just praising God for saving brother Jones that's the way it ought to be that's right amen but but to put your destination your Eternal destination and build your faith upon them things well God if you just send someone just prophesy over me and tell them you know that I'm saved saved I'll be all right no we live by faith we live by faith that that that's what makes all these personalities rise up because people ain't living by faith they're going from preacher to preacher preacher to preacher Church to church they they just want satisfac satisfac uh satisfied they just want to be satisfied they they just want to feel secure the word will secure you if you can get the revelation of what has been said can you say amen you love the Lord amen you may believe it you may not but that's just the way I believe it amen it's got to become a revelation to our hearts amen if the musicians will come God help us to live by faith amen there's anything that we should pray for is revelation God reveal it to me can you say amen amen I thought of Moses's mother how she defied everything because she lived by faith brother Bram said she saw him with the children of Israel taking them over into the promised land she saw that praise the Lord and and and and so by faith and you have you have to realize that everything about Moses growing up was contrary to what what she was confessing she had to give him away Place him in a you know in a in in an ark in in like brother BR would say in death showing the death and Resurrection he was raised up but then you you you look he was reared up taught by the enemy he lived in the enemy's house he's being prepared by the enemy to take the Throne of the enemy he was being taught Egyptian language he was being taught no doubt their cultures he was being dressed like the enemy having their clothes instead of Hebrew clothes she took him as a son hello and yet all along by faith his mother saw a deliverer never moved him never moved her at all by faith she would tell Moses Moses you're a deliverer and what if she would have given up what if she would have looked at the conditions there's my child dressed as an Egyptian speaking Egyptian there's my child he's supposed to be one of us and look he looks more like them what if she just backed off and not said a word but by faith am she didn't see some Egyptian she saw a deliverer she saw the promise and by faith she kept teaching him you're called of God Amen no doubt maybe he was being introduced to all these other gods Moses there's only one God and he called you one of these days you're going to deliver the people amen one of these days she she lived by faith she Ted by faith she taught her children by faith right can you say amen amen that's good did you know know Moses was trained under military of the of the Egyptians he was taught by the best of that day he was taught by their scientists he knew how all the medicines worked he knew all the he was a smart man looked like he had his way made and it looked like there was so much in influences around Moses's life that his poor little old mother didn't even stand a chance amen but you know what the prophet said it was Moses's mother that helped build his [Music] character because she did it by faith she didn't look at what he was she didn't look the way he was being trained by pharaoh and all them by faith she clung to a promise that's right and God honored her and all the influences that he was under could not touch the influence of that mother that's good and her faith caught onto him and the Bible says when he got old enough to take that Throne he by faith refused to be called Pharaoh's Son by Faith Moses when he looked out that window and he saw the slaves out there think of it when Pharaoh looked at them people he just saw nothing but mud dobers and slaves and vagabonds and no good people and all that but by faith when Moses looked out there he saw the children of God he saw the people of God where did he get it his mother was teaching him she was ins stealing something within him and even though it become it was an intellectual Faith at that time it was changing him he began to see something different he chose to be a mud Dober with him than to take the throne can you say Amen but one of these days that that intellectual teaching come together with a personal experience with God Moses was changed that's that you love him we live by faith God help us to live by faith today don't you let the world build your atmosphere in your home don't you let the world build an atmosphere in your life let Faith Create Your Atmosphere can you say amen I will overcome how do you know because I see myself overcoming don't you let the devil talk you out of it I will I I I'm going in how do you know how do you say that you're just human flesh do you feel God no do you feel like you're just saved well at times I do and at times I don't and and all that but I'm still going in Rapture well what do you know how do you know these things I see it I see myself I ain't got time to listen to the devil I ain't got time to listen to the negative I'm not got time to
