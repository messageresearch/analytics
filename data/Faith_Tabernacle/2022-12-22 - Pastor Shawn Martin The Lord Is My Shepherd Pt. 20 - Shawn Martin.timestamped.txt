[26:01] amen and I I know that he is
[26:05] directing this amen and I just thank him
[26:10] for it amen well good to have everyone
[26:13] in the house of Lord trust you at a good
[26:17] day today I was able to stay somewhat
[26:19] warm especially the brothers that had to
[26:22] work out in it but the musicians can be
[26:26] dismissed but tell you what it's good to
[26:28] be on the inside
[26:30] in the house of the Lord to worship Him
[26:32] and sister Lisa it's really good to have
[26:34] you back
[26:35] praise the Lord and glad you're feeling
[26:37] better amen and
[26:41] so glad that the Lord watches over us
[26:44] and
[26:45] that he's our healer amen
[26:47] amen if you have your Bibles we're going
[26:50] to turn to Psalms the 23rd chapter
[26:53] today is Ruth's birthday today she is
[26:56] turned 10. amen so we wish her a happy
[26:59] birthday and
[27:01] and of course she's my daughter so I
[27:04] really appreciate her very much
[27:06] and just feel blessed to have her
[27:10] praise the Lord
[27:14] growing right up
[27:16] man
[27:17] but he heard uh before we go into the
[27:21] word let's just bow our heads and talk
[27:24] to our Lord father
[27:28] our desire is to please you Lord and to
[27:31] walk with you hand in hand
[27:35] that you would lead his father and take
[27:38] our hand Lord
[27:40] father we don't know what road to take
[27:44] where to go but
[27:47] Lord we're just asking that you would
[27:50] just help us
[27:51] and Lord you see the the things that I
[27:55] have on my heart tonight and I pray that
[27:57] you would just help me to be able to
[28:00] express them to the people and
[28:03] Lord that you would take the words and
[28:05] plant it into every heart this evening
[28:08] and
[28:09] Lord we're just commit ourselves to you
[28:12] Lord
[28:13] pray that you would just forgive us of
[28:16] all of our sins our failures Lord and
[28:19] may we be more sincere than we ever have
[28:23] Lord
[28:24] pray that you would just bless your
[28:26] people now
[28:27] in Jesus Christ's name we ask it amen
[28:33] we want to look again in Psalms 23
[28:38] starting at the first verse says the
[28:41] Lord is my shepherd
[28:43] and I shall not want he maketh me to lie
[28:46] down in Green Pastures
[28:49] he leadeth me beside the Still Waters he
[28:52] restoreth my soul
[28:55] and he leads me in the paths of
[28:58] righteousness
[28:59] for his namesake
[29:01] amen you can have your seats this
[29:04] evening
[29:07] and again I want to just continue
[29:14] in the last part of the third verse and
[29:18] he leads me in the paths of
[29:20] righteousness
[29:23] and this may be more of a a sobering
[29:26] subject this evening but I pray that
[29:29] will help us all
[29:30] but here uh first of all
[29:34] as the psalmist said he leads me
[29:38] the Lord leads in ease we've said and
[29:42] he's he's the shepherd so he doesn't he
[29:45] doesn't drive
[29:47] he doesn't follow
[29:50] but he leads he's he's our leader
[29:54] and he leads the sheep and David uh
[29:59] as a sheep of the Lord he he said my so
[30:04] followeth heart after thee amen so he
[30:09] was he was showing
[30:12] what was where his he is following came
[30:17] from
[30:18] and that was from the depths of the Soul
[30:21] my soul followeth heart after thee
[30:24] which shows that the soul had been
[30:27] restored ain't that right
[30:30] and so we we find that the Bible says
[30:34] they who are led by the spirit they are
[30:37] the sons of God so the children of God
[30:40] are going to be led that's just a given
[30:43] fact
[30:44] but a woman a man boy girl has to be
[30:49] meek
[30:49] if if they're going to be led it it
[30:52] there there's a a cry uh uh a standard
[30:57] or a specific
[30:58] um uh people uh that God leads and that
[31:04] is the meek and and here Psalms 25 and
[31:07] 9. it says the meek will he guide in
[31:11] judgment
[31:12] and the meek will he teach his way
[31:16] and all the paths of the Lord are mercy
[31:19] and Truth unto such as keep his Covenant
[31:23] and his testimonies for thy name's sake
[31:27] O Lord pardon mine iniquity for it is
[31:30] great
[31:31] what man is he that feareth the Lord
[31:35] him shall he the Lord teach in the way
[31:40] that he shall choose not what man
[31:43] chooses but the Lord chooses
[31:45] his soul man's Soul shall dwell at ease
[31:49] and his seed shall inherit the earth
[31:53] ain't that right so he guides the meek
[31:56] in judgment and teaches the meek his way
[32:01] and and and that man is one who fears
[32:05] the Lord not not in in the way of of of
[32:09] of uh trembling in in in scared but in
[32:15] in reverence or respect
[32:17] um all and so him shall he teach in the
[32:21] way that he the Lord shall choose now
[32:24] that word meek means humble lowly
[32:29] submissive so those that are submissive
[32:33] and humble the Lord will will teach and
[32:37] show his way
[32:40] and and so we we look and one writer in
[32:45] speaking of of meekness said meekness
[32:47] toward God
[32:49] is that dispensation disposition of
[32:52] spirit in which we accept his dealings
[32:56] with us as good
[32:59] and therefore without disputing or
[33:02] resisting see in the Old Testament the
[33:06] meek are those wholly relying on God
[33:10] rather than their own strength to defend
[33:13] against Injustice thus meekness toward
[33:17] evil people means knowing god is
[33:19] permitting the injuries they inflict
[33:22] that he is using them to purify his
[33:25] elect and that he will deliver his elect
[33:28] in his time
[33:30] gentleness or meekness is the opposite
[33:32] of self-assertiveness or and
[33:35] self-interest it stems from trust in
[33:38] God's goodness and control over the
[33:41] situation so so when we're thinking of
[33:44] paths no wonder that that that it God
[33:48] can only lead and guide those that are
[33:52] Meek uh because again his ways are
[33:55] higher than our ways his thoughts are
[33:58] higher than our thoughts and so it it it
[34:01] takes someone that is submissive and
[34:04] humble a man that is willing to trust
[34:07] God Amen to follow rather than to argue
[34:11] with God and and buck against him and
[34:14] and these things if you understand what
[34:16] I'm saying and so this is why we're
[34:19] considered sheep uh uh uh with the Sheep
[34:23] like nature so David says he leads me in
[34:27] the paths of righteousness and and God
[34:29] God's leading is so different from from
[34:33] uh leadership of man ain't that right
[34:37] now also here we we find that God did
[34:41] not call us just to stand in the paths
[34:46] of righteousness
[34:48] but he is ordained us to walk in the
[34:53] paths of righteousness so whatever path
[34:57] you're on and and uh we've talked about
[35:02] the paths and we will do it again
[35:04] tonight but whatever path you're on or
[35:07] in then you are walking and not standing
[35:12] you're not just set in a path but you're
[35:16] walking in a path he and this is what
[35:19] David's saying he leads me in the paths
[35:22] of righteousness so there's movement
[35:25] there's forwardness there's there's uh
[35:28] progression and that rhyme and I I don't
[35:32] think that God ever allows us to stay uh
[35:38] the same uh individuals or church I I
[35:43] just don't think that God you you will
[35:46] never be able to be the same individual
[35:49] a man that you was yesterday or uh uh or
[35:54] this church will never be able to to to
[35:57] remain uh uh the same
[36:01] um I just saw sister Lydia God bless you
[36:03] sis good to have you praise the Lord and
[36:06] and so I uh we we find that people are
[36:10] either advancing more in God or they are
[36:15] advancing more in the world in other
[36:18] words getting away from God Amen either
[36:21] way you're either you're in your your
[36:24] own life uh uh this church or uh uh your
[36:29] home your family you're either advancing
[36:33] toward Christ or or you're you're you're
[36:36] actually leaving and and and advancing
[36:40] more in the world and and and what
[36:44] determines that is whatever path you're
[36:46] walking in and and so see one path takes
[36:51] you into the things of God and the other
[36:54] path takes you further from the things
[36:57] of God so what's in the heart reflects
[37:01] what path we are walking our attitude
[37:06] towards uh both God and the world uh
[37:11] because if you're walking in the paths
[37:13] of righteousness then or or in in in the
[37:16] other path then you you will have an
[37:20] attitude toward God and you'll also have
[37:24] an attitude toward the world but it all
[37:26] depends on what path you're walking and
[37:29] and so our attitude towards God and the
[37:33] world will reflect as to what path we're
[37:37] walking in our ambition towards both God
[37:41] and the world will show as to what path
[37:45] we are walking in now we we look at
[37:50] Jesus he's our prime example and so uh
[37:54] he he walked and and we'll get more into
[37:57] that but he walked the paths of
[38:00] righteousness and and so then let's look
[38:03] at at his attitude uh here when he says
[38:07] there in John 6 37 I came down from
[38:11] heaven uh uh not to do mine on will but
[38:16] the will of him that sent me amen so now
[38:20] this was his attitude a man on Earth in
[38:24] a body of Flesh was that I've I've come
[38:28] to do the will of of my father ain't
[38:31] that right I've come not my own will not
[38:34] my own will but the will of him that
[38:37] sent me he also said to John the Baptist
[38:41] and and and if if you've listened to the
[38:45] message it becomes us to fulfill all
[38:47] righteousness uh uh and and and and John
[38:51] is actually trying uh uh Jesus come of
[38:55] course we know for fulfillment here as
[38:58] as he's the word John's the prophet the
[39:01] word comes to the prophet but he come to
[39:03] be baptized of John and John don't want
[39:06] to baptize him he he's like no I ain't
[39:09] even worthy to to and to to loosen uh
[39:12] your shoestring in other words your
[39:14] latch it of your shoe and yet Jesus
[39:18] would remind him suffer that to be so
[39:21] but everybody say but it becometh us to
[39:26] fulfill all righteousness see so so this
[39:29] this was the the attitude this was the
[39:33] thoughts this was the heart that Jesus
[39:35] would portray as he was here on this
[39:38] Earth even even in Matthew 26 and 2 uh
[39:43] Jesus uh there when he's praying In The
[39:46] Garden of Gethsemane and and he knew
[39:49] that the time had come for his uh to be
[39:53] crucified and and as as his flesh he did
[39:57] not want to be crucified I don't think
[39:59] any of us would would want to do that
[40:02] but understanding that this was the
[40:05] wheel for him understanding that this
[40:08] was the path that he would walk this was
[40:11] God's will a man that he would give his
[40:14] life for for other Sons and Daughters of
[40:17] God ain't that right and so so he's
[40:21] there and he's praying and and notice
[40:23] the prayer oh my father if if this cup
[40:28] may not pass us from me except I drink
[40:32] it then thy will be done amen see he was
[40:37] humble he was a lamb he he was
[40:40] submissive he was Meek ain't that right
[40:42] and and so we know even in in another uh
[40:47] uh some uh uh
[40:50] description of the prayer he says father
[40:53] if it be possible let this cup pass from
[40:56] me amen he didn't want to but I am so
[41:00] glad that that he was walking the path
[41:03] of righteousness and and he knew that
[41:07] that the word that was predestinated for
[41:10] him a man had to be fulfilled and so he
[41:14] was willing to say not my will father
[41:17] but thine be done so we can understand
[41:20] how and why God can only guide the meek
[41:25] the paths of righteousness is only for
[41:28] the meek and and the humble ain't that
[41:32] right and those that fear uh the Lord
[41:35] and and so uh uh uh Jesus uh uh as he
[41:40] walked the past well David a man it was
[41:43] the same paths that David was talking
[41:45] about it was the same path that David
[41:48] was walking in and and and and and look
[41:52] at at David's heart Psalms 143 8 calls
[41:55] me to hear thy loving kindness in the
[41:59] morning for in thee do I trust he's he's
[42:03] not he's he's not saying God you know
[42:06] I'm so glad you picked me because I got
[42:08] some good ideas for you and and and God
[42:11] I you know or maybe there's a lot of
[42:13] things in David's life that he did not
[42:16] understand and he could not explain and
[42:19] and maybe as his life was a uh uh uh uh
[42:24] uh
[42:25] perplexity to others maybe it was a
[42:28] perplexity to him as well that maybe he
[42:32] just didn't have all the understanding
[42:34] amen I thought even like sister media
[42:37] when she'd tell brother Brown brother we
[42:39] just don't understand or Billy I don't
[42:41] understand you he said well I don't even
[42:42] understand myself a lot of times but but
[42:45] that's the that's not the point it's not
[42:48] that we understand
[42:49] uh uh the way that God leads a lot of
[42:52] times it but but it it does require a
[42:56] heart of trust it it it does require a
[43:00] man our soul to follow hard after him
[43:04] and so he says calls me to hear thy
[43:07] loving kindness in the morning for
[43:09] indeed do I trust cause me to know thou
[43:13] the way wherein I should walk a man for
[43:17] I lift up my soul unto thee and then in
[43:21] the tenth verse he says teach me to do
[43:24] thy will amen
[43:27] there's a teaching involved involved and
[43:30] I don't care how old you are in the Lord
[43:33] there's always a teaching there's always
[43:36] a schooling there's always God is
[43:39] infinite and our little old peanut
[43:41] brains Canary brain uh so to speak it it
[43:45] it it can understand God you'll never
[43:47] get a man live live to be a million
[43:50] years old and you'll still not
[43:52] understand all of God but yet the prayer
[43:55] of the righteous is teach me teach me to
[43:59] do thy will so for thou art my God thy
[44:03] spirit is good lead me in to the land of
[44:07] uprightness now you go to First Peter 4
[44:11] and 1 it says for my for as much then as
[44:15] Christ has suffered for us so we're
[44:18] talking of Christ now David and now us
[44:21] as suffer for us in the flesh arm
[44:24] yourselves likewise with the same mind
[44:27] for he that has suffered In the Flesh
[44:30] has ceased from sin that he no longer
[44:34] should live the rest of his time in the
[44:38] flesh to the lust of men but to the will
[44:41] of God Amen so this is why God Saves us
[44:45] this is this is the this is why God uh
[44:49] doesn't you know uh save you and then
[44:51] just take you home amen it would be nice
[44:54] if it was that way but but that's not it
[44:56] there's a will a man of God to be
[45:00] completed and and we are to live our
[45:04] live our lives this Mortal life not to
[45:08] the lust of men anymore not to our own
[45:10] lust and flesh and desire but it's to to
[45:14] to to live uh uh to the will of God even
[45:19] Jesus taught us to pray and how to pray
[45:22] and in that prayer we we are to pray thy
[45:26] will be done in Earth and and we know
[45:30] what that means Earth and vessel it we
[45:33] are of this Earth ain't that right a man
[45:35] thy will be done in earth as it is in
[45:39] heaven ain't that right and so see God's
[45:43] going to lead his sheep into the paths
[45:46] of righteousness and and all those who
[45:50] are walking the paths of righteousness
[45:52] Echo this prayer in their hearts thy
[45:56] will be done thy will be done can you
[46:00] say Amen so we we find here the path a
[46:05] man as we had read last week it means a
[46:08] course a root a way of life a thought or
[46:12] conduct amen and so the path we walk is
[46:16] reflected in our character and our
[46:19] conduct uh
[46:22] um the center which includes the
[46:24] make-believer uh uh uh to he's just a a
[46:28] religious man but he's just a religious
[46:31] sinner but but the sinner has a a
[46:34] certain conduct which shows the path
[46:37] that they're walking in amen and and
[46:40] also Sons and Daughters uh uh of God
[46:44] also have a certain conduct that shows
[46:48] the path they're walking in I I sought
[46:51] of Proverbs 12 and 5 thought it to be
[46:54] fitting but it says the thoughts the
[46:56] thoughts of the righteous are right but
[47:00] the councils of the wicked are deceit so
[47:05] so you'll never find the councils of the
[47:07] righteous having deceit amen and you'll
[47:11] never find the thoughts of the wicked
[47:13] being right can you say man because it's
[47:17] the path that they're walking in it what
[47:20] what they are reflects a man the path
[47:24] see and so now we know that Christian
[47:26] conduct comes by the word of God it
[47:29] doesn't come by rules it does not come
[47:31] by codes it doesn't come by any of that
[47:35] a man but it comes by the word of God
[47:37] let's look at Ephesians 5 and 3. it
[47:41] tells us to not let fornication and all
[47:45] cleanness or covetness be named once
[47:48] among us as becometh Saints neither
[47:53] filthiness nor foolish talking or nor
[47:56] jesting which are not convenient but
[48:00] rather giving of thanks for this you
[48:04] know that no whoremonger or unclean
[48:07] person nor Covetous man who is an
[48:11] idolater and and we know idolatery does
[48:15] not have to be setting up an image like
[48:17] they would in India or Buddha or or
[48:20] where Buddhist or whatever wherever they
[48:22] are there's many idolaters that are in a
[48:26] church today that that have have have
[48:29] got God as a figment of their
[48:31] imagination they have formed a god of
[48:34] Christendom in their imagination can you
[48:37] say man amen see but but so who is an
[48:41] idolater or he has any inheritance in
[48:45] the Kingdom of Christ and of God ain't
[48:48] that right amen see so let no man
[48:51] deceive you with vain words for because
[48:54] of these things cometh the wrath of God
[48:58] upon the children of Disobedience so
[49:01] this is the trait of children of
[49:04] Disobedience and this is why Paul would
[49:07] tell us as as Believers don't don't let
[49:11] this these things be named among you can
[49:14] you say man he says be ye not therefore
[49:18] partakers with them for you were
[49:22] sometimes Darkness you used to be in the
[49:26] darkness you used to be like that but
[49:29] now are you light in the Lord walk
[49:32] everybody say walk as children of the
[49:36] light can you say man so so when God
[49:40] changed you amen and filled you with
[49:43] this Spirit there is a new way of life
[49:46] there is a new way of thought there is a
[49:49] new nature there there is a new there
[49:52] the conduct a new character everything
[49:55] about you is new can you say man you
[49:58] might have the same body a man the same
[50:01] color of eyes same color of hair or uh
[50:04] same flat nose or whatever you got amen
[50:07] but there's something a man that is new
[50:11] that controls this body can you say man
[50:14] so he says now you're you are like you
[50:18] are light in the Lord so walk as
[50:20] children of the light see not everything
[50:23] is acceptable amen as children of the
[50:26] light there's things that belong in the
[50:29] light that that that that uh Christians
[50:32] amen bear witness of and and then
[50:35] there's things that are in the darkness
[50:37] that children of Darkness bear witness
[50:39] of ain't that right but Paul would say
[50:42] you're Children of the light don't get
[50:44] that mixed up don't get the traits mixed
[50:46] up don't get the character and the
[50:48] conducts mixed up you are children of
[50:51] the light can you say man walk as
[50:53] children of the light
[50:57] now Titus 2 and 1 says but speak thou
[51:00] the things which become sound Doctrine
[51:03] sound Doctrine see a man and if it's not
[51:07] sound Doctrine leave it alone
[51:09] that the Aged men so now he's got
[51:12] something for Aged men be sober grave
[51:15] temperate sound in faith in charity in
[51:20] patience
[51:21] the age aged women likewise that they be
[51:25] in Behavior as becometh Holiness not
[51:29] false accusers not given to much wine
[51:33] teachers of good things ain't that right
[51:37] that they may teach the young women to
[51:41] be sober to love their husbands to love
[51:44] their children to be discreet Chase
[51:47] keepers at home good obedient to their
[51:51] husbands that the word of God be not
[51:56] blasphemed can you say man so Christians
[51:59] amen Sons and Daughters of God they want
[52:02] to be careful that they that their
[52:05] actions don't blaspheme the word of God
[52:07] or or that that the the Sinners out
[52:11] there and and the people that doesn't
[52:13] understand amen the Bible that they
[52:16] won't look at your actions and say and
[52:18] he says he's a Christian she says she's
[52:21] a Christian that's it's nonsense can you
[52:24] say amen and then they start blaspheming
[52:27] the very holy ghost that you claim to
[52:29] have can you say amen amen so so we find
[52:33] then he's got uh uh uh uh exhortation
[52:37] for young men young men likewise exhort
[52:40] to be sober minded can you say man don't
[52:44] be double-minded don't don't just be
[52:47] letting your mind wander around and and
[52:49] and and and uh to where you can't be
[52:52] planted and and you can't be established
[52:55] uh uh be sober minded in all things
[53:00] showing thyself a pattern of Good Works
[53:05] in Doctrine showing uncorrectness
[53:08] gravity
[53:10] sincerity sound speech that cannot be
[53:15] condemned
[53:17] then you say amen and I want to say this
[53:20] now amen if if people are looking at
[53:23] your life and thinking your life is a
[53:25] joke your Christian Life is a joke and
[53:27] they're not really taking you serious
[53:29] don't you look at them people and blame
[53:31] them I know there's always going to be
[53:33] critics don't get me wrong on that Jesus
[53:35] had their critics and his critics they
[53:38] called him a devil and all of these
[53:40] things but but then if there's a pattern
[53:42] there then you've got to look and make
[53:45] sure that you're following the very
[53:48] scriptures can you say man that's right
[53:51] having no evil thing to say of you so he
[53:56] says exhort servants a man to be
[53:59] obedient unto their own masters and and
[54:01] and yeah that that might have been
[54:03] served but but we could even look at
[54:05] employees and uh uh you know them you
[54:09] know the same thing back talking mouth
[54:11] and being just irreverent disrespecting
[54:14] and all of these things any kind of
[54:16] leadership whether it's in the church
[54:18] whether it's at home whether it's at the
[54:21] job or whatever we are taught to conduct
[54:24] ourselves
[54:25] can you say Amen to be obedient unto
[54:29] their own masters and to please them
[54:31] well in all things not answering again
[54:34] not being smart Alec not being you know
[54:37] mouthy not being I don't care if you
[54:39] just agree or disagree that that has
[54:41] nothing to do with it can you say Amen
[54:44] see not purloin but showing all good
[54:48] Fidelity that they may Adorn the
[54:51] doctrine of God our savior in all things
[54:55] ain't that right for the grace of God
[54:59] that bringeth salvation hath appeared to
[55:02] all men teaching us everybody say
[55:05] teaching us remember this is what David
[55:08] had prayed teach me thy ways amen the
[55:11] god the meek will he guide and and and
[55:14] these things teaching us Amen to Meek
[55:18] that denying ungodliness and worldly
[55:21] lust desires and we should live soberly
[55:26] righteously and godly in this present
[55:29] world the world may be doing something
[55:31] but we're not to be doing that thing the
[55:34] church nominal may be acting ridiculous
[55:37] but we're not to be acting ridiculous
[55:39] can you say man amen they may be pulling
[55:42] the world into their church and into
[55:44] their home but we're not to be doing
[55:46] them things I don't care if it makes you
[55:49] an oddball I don't care if it makes you
[55:51] part of the uh uh the minus uh uh the
[55:55] very very uh whatever uh small minority
[55:59] a man we are walking on the paths of
[56:04] righteousness
[56:06] can you say man looking for that blessed
[56:09] hope and the Glorious appearing of the
[56:12] great God and our Savior Jesus Christ so
[56:16] there is a conduct there is a character
[56:18] there is a a thing that we must live by
[56:21] can you say man man you're you're not to
[56:24] style yourself after the world you're
[56:27] not to try to Fashion yourself after the
[56:30] world Amen I I don't care if they come
[56:32] up with a certain kind of a haircut Amen
[56:35] brother Branham got on talked about the
[56:38] Fashions ain't that right and it doesn't
[56:40] just apply to women it applies to men it
[56:43] any Christian should not fashion after
[56:47] the world if they've got their little
[56:48] skinny jeans that want to look like
[56:50] perverts I hope to God that a holy
[56:53] ghost-filled person will never do that
[56:57] I don't think they will unless God
[56:59] condemns them for that can you say amen
[57:02] amen that's right amen but it's the same
[57:05] way sisters you are to honor your
[57:07] husbands
[57:09] can you say man you are to give them
[57:13] respect whether you understand them or
[57:16] not whether you believe in it or not
[57:18] that back you you might be the most
[57:20] smartest woman on the world in the world
[57:22] and the most brightest individual in
[57:25] your own home amen but God put you as a
[57:29] uh put the man as the head can you say
[57:31] amen and I understand a lot of times a
[57:34] lot of men just want to keep acting up
[57:36] and and and it's hard I I just be honest
[57:39] it would be hard to respect someone that
[57:41] stays on video games uh uh when they get
[57:44] home
[57:45] it would be hard for me to respect a a
[57:48] man a man it's it's hard for me to do
[57:50] that you understand that that they would
[57:52] watch the movies on their phone and got
[57:55] all that cussing and swearing and all
[57:57] these things you understand what I'm
[57:59] saying amen I I what I would say is get
[58:03] right with God and really get converted
[58:05] until them desires leave you it'll make
[58:09] you so sick of it until you don't want
[58:12] it again can you say man for how are you
[58:15] going to lead amen if you ain't going to
[58:17] get respect out of your amen I I know
[58:19] you know uh uh men men sometimes get get
[58:23] it to where well you know I'm the head
[58:25] so you listen to me anyhow amen and and
[58:28] that's wrong too and you're going to
[58:30] answer for that ain't ain't that right
[58:32] see there is a conduct
[58:36] men are to be spiritual heads of their
[58:38] home
[58:39] it's it's sickening when a man's
[58:41] supposed to be the head of their home
[58:42] and and and and letting her family stay
[58:45] home from church
[58:47] it's disgusting it's sickening and I
[58:49] just believe it's if it's sickening to
[58:52] God as well amen that that uh you know
[58:55] that the the man will teach their
[58:57] children that work is more important
[59:00] than the house of God damn and and the
[59:02] same see Christians have got a conduct
[59:06] have got a character that they've got to
[59:09] display Amen to show the path that
[59:12] they're walking on you can't walk the
[59:15] path of righteousness and disobey God's
[59:17] word
[59:20] well it's true
[59:22] so now brother Branham would tell us see
[59:24] you you see yourself conducting yourself
[59:27] unlike a Christian if you see yourself
[59:30] conducting yourself unlike a Christian
[59:33] then you know that that's wrong can you
[59:36] say man well how am I supposed to
[59:38] conduct like a Christian because I watch
[59:41] system so and so or I watch Brothers
[59:43] well you should be honest you should you
[59:47] young people should be able to watch our
[59:49] elders amen and see how they behave in
[59:52] the house of God you should be able Amen
[59:55] to watch the Elder sisters how they
[59:57] treat their husbands and and and what's
[59:59] the the the the the these uh older men
[1:00:02] and how they rule their house and and
[1:00:05] they're not just bullies and and all
[1:00:07] these things but yet they're leaders
[1:00:09] ain't that right you should be able to
[1:00:12] watch them things amen but a lot of
[1:00:15] times you can't because a lot of people
[1:00:17] are just so backslid and lukewarm and
[1:00:20] and they're going to do just what
[1:00:21] they're going gonna do amen so so let's
[1:00:24] get it back to the word amen you see
[1:00:27] yourself conducting unlike a Christian
[1:00:30] you know that's wrong ain't that right
[1:00:33] be why why would you know it's wrong for
[1:00:35] one the spirit of the Lord would convict
[1:00:37] you for that
[1:00:39] ain't that right amen see and hopefully
[1:00:42] you got a preacher that'll condemn them
[1:00:44] things
[1:00:46] amen but look go back and check up with
[1:00:49] god with his word here with this book
[1:00:52] and get right with God can you say Amen
[1:00:54] so you don't don't you you see someone
[1:00:57] acting you know some sister treating her
[1:00:59] husband and bossing him around and all
[1:01:01] that don't you look for that as a
[1:01:03] pattern look for the word of God can you
[1:01:06] say Amen you see someone just missing
[1:01:08] church and disregarding the house of God
[1:01:11] don't you look at that as a pattern
[1:01:13] young people you look at God's word amen
[1:01:16] and study it by the word of God can you
[1:01:19] say amen amen there's a conduct you
[1:01:22] young men amen you hanging around these
[1:01:24] other men that hate man all they do is
[1:01:26] watch their videos and play their games
[1:01:28] and and then they just talk they don't
[1:01:31] talk anything about the lord they're
[1:01:32] just just talking about all kinds of
[1:01:34] nonsense and breeding demons whether
[1:01:37] it's in their home in their truck on the
[1:01:39] job or whatever don't you look at that
[1:01:42] as a as an example amen there is a word
[1:01:45] to file like can you to say man and I
[1:01:47] pray that you would be able to look at
[1:01:49] our deacons amen and say that's an
[1:01:51] example right there I pray that you can
[1:01:53] look at our Our Song leaders and say
[1:01:55] that's an example right there I pray
[1:01:58] that you can look at this old preacher

[1:02:01] that's an example there can you say man
[1:02:04] I pray that you can look at us our Elder
[1:02:07] sisters amen and see some Godly examples
[1:02:10] that say that's what I want to be
[1:02:13] wow there's a conduct
[1:02:16] there's a character
[1:02:18] and it reflects the path you're on
[1:02:21] but not only do our thoughts and actions
[1:02:24] reflect the path we're walking in but
[1:02:26] our decisions reflected as well
[1:02:29] every decision that we make
[1:02:31] as I've told you many many times through
[1:02:34] the years you're Christian
[1:02:36] when you make a decision you do not make
[1:02:39] it upon anything but you're a Christian
[1:02:44] are you listening to me people make
[1:02:47] these decisions and expect amen expect
[1:02:50] you know and come up with these excuses
[1:02:52] why they made the decision except expect
[1:02:54] it to be okay they'll take their
[1:02:56] families away from the house of God and
[1:02:58] move hours away
[1:03:00] from the house of God and then they
[1:03:02] didn't come into church they ain't just
[1:03:04] whenever they can they got you know uh
[1:03:06] uh children that need God and all of
[1:03:09] these things amen that that to me you
[1:03:11] didn't make that decision as a Believer
[1:03:14] can you say amen I think as a Christian
[1:03:16] amen I don't care where you're going to
[1:03:18] move to I just don't care be at a church
[1:03:21] whether it's this church whether it's
[1:03:23] the church next door or whatever be
[1:03:25] faithful in the house of God Amen
[1:03:28] support that Pastor support that
[1:03:30] Ministry amen lift up their hands amen
[1:03:33] when trouble tries to come around there
[1:03:35] be the first to stifle that trouble amen
[1:03:37] and say let's pray about it can you say
[1:03:39] man let's be an example of the believer
[1:03:45] ain't that right
[1:03:47] so now David makes it clear to us that
[1:03:50] he is being led in the in the paths of
[1:03:52] righteousness not only by telling us
[1:03:55] that he is but let's watch the decisions
[1:03:58] he made notice what he said in in Psalms
[1:04:03] 101 and there's a lot more but I got a
[1:04:04] lot scriptures to go so I'm not going to
[1:04:07] to go in all of it but he says Psalms
[1:04:10] 101 3 I will set everybody say I will
[1:04:13] set
[1:04:14] no Wicked thing before mine eyes
[1:04:19] and you say Amen
[1:04:21] this was not optional to him he was
[1:04:23] walking in the paths of righteousness
[1:04:26] and he knew this was not the conduct of
[1:04:30] a believer
[1:04:33] hello
[1:04:35] see he's walking and in the paths of
[1:04:38] righteousness and as he's walking he's
[1:04:40] getting closer to God and you know as he
[1:04:42] gets closer to God he's getting further
[1:04:44] and further away from the world
[1:04:48] it's true he's departing that from that
[1:04:51] which is wicked first Samuel 24 13 tells
[1:04:55] us that wickedness proceeds from the
[1:04:58] wicked
[1:04:59] wickedness does not proceed from the
[1:05:02] righteous
[1:05:03] ain't that right wickedness proceeds
[1:05:06] from the wicked then then it must go to
[1:05:09] show that righteousness proceeds from
[1:05:12] the righteous if wickedness comes from
[1:05:15] Wicked then righteousness comes from
[1:05:18] righteous
[1:05:20] ain't that right now notice proverbs 10
[1:05:23] 16 the labor of the righteous tendeth to
[1:05:27] life
[1:05:28] notice that the labor of the righteous
[1:05:31] tendeth to life everything that a
[1:05:35] righteous man does is for life
[1:05:39] can you say Amen but the fruit of the
[1:05:42] wickedness to sin so the labor of the
[1:05:45] righteous tendeth the life the fruit of
[1:05:48] the wicked descend
[1:05:50] ain't that right fruits of the wicked
[1:05:52] sin
[1:05:55] labors of the righteous life
[1:05:58] ain't that right so the labor the
[1:06:01] righteous labor
[1:06:02] labor to stay in life
[1:06:05] labor to produce life
[1:06:08] labor to Project Life
[1:06:12] can you say man
[1:06:13] I I hope this is okay
[1:06:16] now look Psalms 91 and 9 because thou
[1:06:20] Hast made the Lord
[1:06:23] which is my refuge even the most high
[1:06:26] thy habitation now what's he saying a
[1:06:30] decision was made
[1:06:33] ain't that right
[1:06:34] if you look brother Branham had to make
[1:06:36] them decisions
[1:06:38] ain't that right and every one of us
[1:06:41] have to make the decision
[1:06:43] yes sir so because thou has made the
[1:06:46] Lord which is my refuge even the most
[1:06:48] high thy habitation look at the
[1:06:51] blessings there shall no evil befall
[1:06:54] thee neither shall any player come
[1:06:56] neither thy dwelling for he shall give
[1:06:58] his angels charge over thee to keep thee
[1:07:02] in all thy ways
[1:07:05] now do you understand what that means
[1:07:07] that does not mean that it's going to be
[1:07:10] a life of luxury a walk of of ease and
[1:07:14] on all that but this is one good thing
[1:07:16] about it you will not be destroyed
[1:07:20] you will not despair
[1:07:22] you will not come to not
[1:07:25] for on these Paths of righteousness are
[1:07:28] the Angels of God with that believer
[1:07:35] now as we said there are basically two
[1:07:38] paths to walk
[1:07:42] according to Jeremiah 21 8.
[1:07:45] and there is there is what the Bible
[1:07:48] calls the way of death
[1:07:50] Jesus said it is a broad way which leads
[1:07:53] to destruction we talked about it last
[1:07:55] Wednesday
[1:07:57] and the other path is a way of life
[1:08:00] which is as Jesus called a narrow way
[1:08:03] but it leads to life
[1:08:06] Jesus said I am the way
[1:08:09] the truth the life
[1:08:11] amen he's the word
[1:08:14] ain't that right
[1:08:16] so last last Wednesday I I spoke about
[1:08:20] the contrast between the two paths
[1:08:23] the Broadway is a way of Darkness
[1:08:26] and many there be which go in there at
[1:08:29] but notice God gives a warning
[1:08:33] in Proverbs 14.
[1:08:36] in or not into the path of the wicked
[1:08:40] now now as he's reading this then
[1:08:44] apparently
[1:08:47] he's he's doing more than just assuming
[1:08:49] he knows
[1:08:51] that whoever he's talking to which is us
[1:08:55] we know what is the path of the wicked
[1:09:00] we know
[1:09:03] God sent us a prophet
[1:09:06] we know
[1:09:09] can you say man
[1:09:10] the book has been open we know
[1:09:15] right so inner not into the path of the
[1:09:20] wicked and go not in the way of evil men
[1:09:24] avoid it
[1:09:26] pass not by it don't even get close
[1:09:31] right
[1:09:33] turn from it
[1:09:35] and pass away
[1:09:39] if you go to the 19th verse The Way of
[1:09:41] the Wicked is as Darkness they know not
[1:09:45] at what they stumble
[1:09:48] so it's a way of ignorance
[1:09:54] of Darkness blind
[1:09:58] Psalms 82 5 speaks of the wicked and
[1:10:01] says they know not neither will they
[1:10:03] understand
[1:10:05] they walk on in darkness
[1:10:07] they know not they perceive not and
[1:10:11] neither do they understand and neither
[1:10:12] will they understand
[1:10:14] they just walk on in darkness
[1:10:17] it reminds me of a couple scriptures but
[1:10:20] of first of all Hosea 7 and 8 Ephraim he
[1:10:24] hath mixed himself among the people
[1:10:26] Ephraim is a cake not turned strangers
[1:10:30] have devired his strength and he knoweth
[1:10:33] it not
[1:10:35] yay gray hairs are here and they're upon
[1:10:39] him yet he knoweth it not
[1:10:44] ain't that right
[1:10:46] he's weak and he don't know it
[1:10:49] he's gotten old and he don't know it
[1:10:52] now Ecclesiastes 10 15 the labor of the
[1:10:57] foolish weary of everyone
[1:11:03] because he knoweth not
[1:11:06] how to go to the city
[1:11:10] now I thought of that as I was just
[1:11:12] pondering
[1:11:15] and I wasn't trying to come up with
[1:11:17] something it just came
[1:11:19] there is a city that John spoke of
[1:11:25] right
[1:11:27] the Bible even says Abraham look for
[1:11:29] that City
[1:11:33] and yet we've got the foolish that is is
[1:11:36] wearing everyone for he's laboring to
[1:11:39] get there
[1:11:41] and yet he knoweth not how
[1:11:48] he has the Bible he has the message he
[1:11:51] has the faithful Ministry
[1:11:53] that God himself has placed in the body
[1:11:55] and yet he knoweth not how
[1:11:58] to go to the city
[1:12:01] now that that that's just the thoughts
[1:12:03] that come to my mind
[1:12:05] now here are other scriptures that speak
[1:12:07] of those who walk the way of Darkness
[1:12:10] Psalms 92 and 5 oh Lord how great are
[1:12:14] thy works and thy thoughts are very deep
[1:12:19] a brutish now I looked up that word
[1:12:21] brutish it means foolish stupid
[1:12:25] so a foolish a Brutus foolish stupid man
[1:12:29] no it's not
[1:12:31] now notice what he says O Lord great are
[1:12:34] thy works and thy thoughts are very deep
[1:12:37] a brutish foolish stupid man noeth not
[1:12:40] neither does a fool understand this
[1:12:46] they just this they they just regard God
[1:12:49] as just someone of him
[1:12:51] but his ways are deep
[1:12:54] his thoughts are great his works are
[1:12:57] great
[1:12:58] and yet that foolish ignorant man
[1:13:01] understandeth is not
[1:13:04] blames God for everything
[1:13:07] yet doesn't even believe in his
[1:13:09] existence most of the time
[1:13:12] unless he needs someone to blame
[1:13:16] right
[1:13:17] so thinking of this of not knowing way
[1:13:21] of darkness in Revelations 3 15 Jesus
[1:13:24] speaks to this laodicean age saying I
[1:13:27] Know Thy works
[1:13:30] right Thou Art neither cold nor hot I
[1:13:34] would that thou were cold or hot so then
[1:13:37] because Thou Art lukewarm and neither
[1:13:39] cold nor hot I will spew thee out of my
[1:13:41] mouth because thou says I'm rich and
[1:13:43] increase with Goods now notice this
[1:13:46] they're saying this and and and and and
[1:13:48] so and have need of nothing and no it's
[1:13:52] not everybody's saying no it's not so
[1:13:54] these people are walking the wicked path
[1:13:57] a way of Darkness they know it's not
[1:13:59] that thou art wretched miserable poor
[1:14:01] blind and naked
[1:14:04] ain't that right they say they're right
[1:14:07] but God says you're not
[1:14:09] they say God is with us God says I'm not
[1:14:12] they say we're walking the Christian
[1:14:15] path God says no it's not
[1:14:18] ain't that right so if the whole if the
[1:14:21] spirit of God knows that these people
[1:14:23] are lukewarm then it would go to show
[1:14:26] that Holy ghost-filled people know what
[1:14:29] the difference between hot cold and
[1:14:33] lukewarm as well
[1:14:35] if the spirit of the age is crying again
[1:14:38] out in this age
[1:14:40] what do you think that spirit is that
[1:14:42] you got
[1:14:46] hope you understand you say well I got
[1:14:49] the Holy Spirit
[1:14:51] and live in lukewarm nonsense
[1:14:55] for the holy spirit says I condemn that
[1:14:57] thing
[1:14:59] the Holy Spirit they're telling God
[1:15:01] we're okay and God's answering back no
[1:15:04] you're not
[1:15:06] I'm gonna spew you out of my mouth then
[1:15:09] wouldn't that go to show that The Same
[1:15:12] Spirit that is crying out at these
[1:15:14] people Amen in this layout of sin age if
[1:15:17] that spirit is in you it would cry out
[1:15:20] the same
[1:15:24] so see
[1:15:25] hear the holy spirit in this age is
[1:15:27] contradicting what they're saying
[1:15:29] because why why is he contradicting he's
[1:15:33] the spirit of Truth
[1:15:35] they're not speaking truth the spirit of
[1:15:38] Truth is crying out
[1:15:39] and telling it just like it is you're
[1:15:43] blind you're wretched you're naked
[1:15:44] you're miserable I don't care what you
[1:15:46] tell me this is what it is because it
[1:15:50] was the spirit of Truth
[1:15:52] ain't that right and believers who are
[1:15:55] filled with the Holy Spirit know the
[1:15:57] difference no matter how much people say
[1:15:59] they have a genuine experience with God
[1:16:01] people that are filled with the Holy
[1:16:04] Ghost know the difference
[1:16:06] Watch The Life watch the conduct
[1:16:13] come on now
[1:16:16] you say well you're talking too hard
[1:16:20] if you've got the same spirit of God
[1:16:22] that is crying out in this age it'll
[1:16:24] it'll do you the same
[1:16:27] that same Spirit can't tolerate
[1:16:28] lukewarmness
[1:16:30] that same Spirit cannot let's just say
[1:16:32] it that the Holy Spirit does not like
[1:16:34] professions
[1:16:36] he just can't stand the fact that people
[1:16:39] can't get over the pornography he just
[1:16:41] can't stand the fact that people can't
[1:16:43] get over their selfish ways he can't
[1:16:46] stand the fact that people just so
[1:16:49] materialistic minded money-minded
[1:16:51] everything about this world and they'll
[1:16:54] make sure they're there on time on the
[1:16:55] job come to the church they walk in late
[1:16:57] constantly
[1:17:03] all right man
[1:17:05] all it is is laodicea
[1:17:08] but the Holy Spirit cries out against it
[1:17:13] and you say Amen
[1:17:15] so see the believer is not walking in
[1:17:18] darkness why he has the spirit of Truth
[1:17:22] do you understand church if we had not
[1:17:24] the spirit of Truth
[1:17:27] what do we do
[1:17:30] we accept homosexuals like all the other
[1:17:32] churches are doing
[1:17:35] we have broken up
[1:17:36] families
[1:17:38] broken motherhood like the world has
[1:17:43] not if we have the spirit of Truth
[1:17:46] it'll keep motherhood alive
[1:17:49] in the home
[1:17:52] ain't that right it keeps dad as the
[1:17:54] head of the home
[1:17:57] it keeps dad as a spiritual man in the
[1:17:59] house
[1:18:01] ain't that right keeps Mom and Dad
[1:18:03] praying for them children
[1:18:07] true
[1:18:11] why
[1:18:13] we're walking paths of righteousness
[1:18:15] who's leading us a goat is a goat
[1:18:18] leading us to slaughter absolutely not
[1:18:21] it's the spirit of Truth
[1:18:27] oh is okay
[1:18:28] but this is why the elect of God will
[1:18:30] not be deceived
[1:18:32] they're not going to be deceived can you
[1:18:35] say man
[1:18:36] so notice how dangerous this way of
[1:18:38] darkness is Proverbs 9 13 a foolish
[1:18:41] woman now woman in the Bible symbolizes
[1:18:44] Church
[1:18:46] so a foolish woman is clamorous and and
[1:18:48] so I I believe this types out not just
[1:18:51] the natural of course brother Brown says
[1:18:53] look at the natural and you'll you'll
[1:18:55] see the spiritual as well
[1:18:57] implication so a foolish woman is
[1:18:59] clamorous she is simple and knoweth
[1:19:01] nothing
[1:19:03] for she sitteth at the door of her house
[1:19:06] on a seat in the high places of the city
[1:19:08] to call passengers who go right on their
[1:19:12] ways
[1:19:13] whoso is simple let him turn in hither
[1:19:17] you know simple without understanding
[1:19:22] and as for him that wanteth or lacks
[1:19:25] understanding
[1:19:27] she saith to him stolen waters are sweet
[1:19:29] and bread eaten in secret is Pleasant
[1:19:33] but he knoweth not that the Dead are
[1:19:36] there
[1:19:38] and that her guests are in the depths of
[1:19:41] hell
[1:19:48] Direction
[1:19:50] ain't that right
[1:19:51] and I would say to you many there be
[1:19:55] that go in there at
[1:19:59] now notice the paths of righteousness is
[1:20:01] what Jesus called the narrow way
[1:20:04] it is the way of light
[1:20:07] and few there be that find it
[1:20:10] is this all right
[1:20:12] brother Graham said the paths of
[1:20:14] righteousness were Paths of light
[1:20:17] and life
[1:20:19] is that right
[1:20:20] now in proverbs 4 8 Solomon called this
[1:20:24] path the path of the just
[1:20:27] it's as The Shining Light that shineth
[1:20:30] more and more unto the perfect day
[1:20:33] so if you notice the light gets brighter
[1:20:36] as we walk
[1:20:37] not dimmer
[1:20:40] it gets brighter
[1:20:42] it gets stronger not weaker
[1:20:45] ain't that right
[1:20:47] so now notice II Samuel 22 and 29 for
[1:20:51] thou art my lamp
[1:20:53] oh Lord
[1:20:55] and the Lord will lighten my darkness
[1:21:01] so Thou Art remember the Lord is the
[1:21:03] shepherd he's the one that's leading Us
[1:21:04] in the paths of righteousness he does
[1:21:07] not lead he's not the one leading in the
[1:21:09] way of Darkness amen he does not lead
[1:21:12] people to where you know they have no
[1:21:14] understanding
[1:21:16] now come on Church
[1:21:19] I don't care how long you've been
[1:21:21] serving the lord
[1:21:23] if the Lord is leading you there's
[1:21:25] something about it you will start
[1:21:27] getting understanding
[1:21:32] right
[1:21:35] I've met people they say well oh you
[1:21:37] know we're just getting too deep too
[1:21:38] deep too deep not here but other places
[1:21:41] they get onto the preachers for studying
[1:21:43] too much and preaching deep things
[1:21:45] just stay with simple Jesus loves me
[1:21:49] if you're walking in the paths of
[1:21:51] righteousness
[1:21:53] he the spirit of truth will lead and
[1:21:56] guide you into all everybody say all all
[1:22:00] truth
[1:22:04] so the Lord will lighten my darkness
[1:22:06] John 12 35 Jesus said unto them yet a
[1:22:10] little while is the light with you walk
[1:22:13] everybody say walk while you have the
[1:22:16] light less Darkness come upon you
[1:22:21] you refuse to walk in the light the
[1:22:23] darkness will come
[1:22:26] as I said you cannot remain the same you
[1:22:29] either walk in the dark in the light or
[1:22:31] Darkness you will walk in darkness can
[1:22:34] you say amen and I tell you what I
[1:22:37] appreciate the message of the hour I
[1:22:40] appreciate the Revelation that God has
[1:22:42] sent us can you say amen and we must not
[1:22:45] take that for granted because you could
[1:22:47] sit in a message Church Without
[1:22:48] understanding
[1:22:51] you can focus upon the world you can
[1:22:53] focus upon the wrongs you could focus
[1:22:55] upon the negative of the Church of the
[1:22:57] world of the politics you can focus on
[1:23:00] the on the negative of the of the of the
[1:23:02] music you can let everything else bother
[1:23:04] you and you could come to church and sit
[1:23:06] in darkness without understanding why
[1:23:09] you feel your mind up you feel your
[1:23:11] heart you feel everything up and fill
[1:23:14] yourself up with everything else that
[1:23:16] does not matter has no concern
[1:23:19] whatsoever
[1:23:24] amen hello
[1:23:27] walk while you have the light
[1:23:32] less Darkness come upon you for he that
[1:23:35] walketh in darkness knoweth not whether
[1:23:37] he goeth
[1:23:38] now are we ones that know where we're
[1:23:40] going
[1:23:41] I hope you do
[1:23:43] I'm going in a rapture
[1:23:45] I I know there's a millennium head that
[1:23:48] I know just any day where we're going to
[1:23:50] break through to this thing we know
[1:23:53] where we're going
[1:23:55] all right
[1:24:01] while you have light
[1:24:03] believe in the light
[1:24:07] that you may be children
[1:24:09] of the light
[1:24:12] can you say Amen
[1:24:14] so one walks in darkness which is a sign
[1:24:17] that there is no understanding
[1:24:18] revelation
[1:24:21] they walk in darkness they're not seeing
[1:24:23] the word manifested it's it's remember
[1:24:25] that's what light is is the word of God
[1:24:27] made manifest
[1:24:29] that's why we we look at brother Branham
[1:24:31] we can identify him as Malachi 4 not
[1:24:33] because he said he was
[1:24:35] there's all kinds of guys out there that
[1:24:37] that we could have followed and and the
[1:24:39] followers of Jim Jones the follower of
[1:24:41] David koresh the followers of of John
[1:24:44] Alexander dowey and and all this I
[1:24:46] thought he he thought he was Elijah
[1:24:49] amen but we're not we're not as those
[1:24:52] that are walking in darkness
[1:24:54] we we've seen the light because we've
[1:24:56] seen scriptures come to life can you say
[1:24:59] Amen so so we find one walks in darkness
[1:25:02] a sign that there is no understanding
[1:25:05] the other walks in light showing that
[1:25:07] there is an understanding a a revelation
[1:25:11] ain't that right so Proverbs 15 and 9
[1:25:14] and I'm getting ready to close but it
[1:25:16] says The Way of the Wicked is an
[1:25:18] Abomination unto the Lord but he loveth
[1:25:21] him that followeth after righteousness
[1:25:26] The Way of the Wicked is an Abomination
[1:25:28] I don't care how religious it is
[1:25:32] their actions their conduct their way of
[1:25:35] living is is its Abomination but he that
[1:25:38] followeth after righteousness he loveth
[1:25:45] so what kind of people are walking on
[1:25:47] this path of righteousness
[1:25:49] people of understanding
[1:25:52] Colossians 4 6 let your speech be all
[1:25:56] the way with Grace season with salt
[1:25:58] that you may know how
[1:26:01] you ought to answer every man
[1:26:04] first Thessalonians 4 2 4 you know
[1:26:08] see you're not in the class North at not
[1:26:11] for you know what Commandments we gave
[1:26:14] you by the Lord Jesus for this is the
[1:26:17] will of God even your sanctification
[1:26:19] that you should abstain from fornication
[1:26:22] that every one of you should know how to
[1:26:26] possess his vessel in sanctification and
[1:26:30] honor can you aren't you glad you know
[1:26:32] we know see we're not on the extreme of
[1:26:36] of legalism we're not in the extreme of
[1:26:38] this way of making Grace a disgrace we
[1:26:41] know amen how to possess our vessel
[1:26:46] I hope this is all right
[1:26:49] second Thessalonians 3 and 6.
[1:26:54] for now we command you brethren in the
[1:26:56] name of our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:26:58] that you withdraw yourselves from every
[1:27:01] brother that walketh disorderly
[1:27:03] and not after the tradition which he
[1:27:05] hath received of us for yourselves know
[1:27:09] how you ought to follow us for we
[1:27:12] behaved not ourselves disorderly among
[1:27:15] you ain't that right so see there is a
[1:27:18] people that know they they know
[1:27:21] it's not because they're smarter than
[1:27:23] others it's because they're walking in
[1:27:25] the path of light
[1:27:27] are you with me
[1:27:28] they're not turning themselves into
[1:27:31] blindness
[1:27:32] no no no Darkness has not come upon them
[1:27:36] gross Darkness has not come upon them
[1:27:38] amen but yet in in the grow and the hour
[1:27:40] of gross Darkness upon the Earth and
[1:27:42] upon the people it would say but arise
[1:27:45] and shine amen for thy light has come
[1:27:49] ain't that right so walk in the light
[1:27:52] while you have the light that you may be
[1:27:54] Children of the light
[1:27:56] and as you're the children of the light
[1:27:58] you're walking in the light then you
[1:28:00] know the difference between right and
[1:28:01] wrong
[1:28:02] you know how to possess your vessels you
[1:28:05] know
[1:28:15] as we
[1:28:17] go along
[1:28:20] in the other services you you and in
[1:28:23] teaching or talking on this you'll
[1:28:25] understand that Jesus stayed with the
[1:28:28] word because he knew what was written of
[1:28:30] him
[1:28:32] and he was he he was Meek he was a lamb
[1:28:35] he was humble and his whole purpose was
[1:28:37] to do the will of the father right
[1:28:39] so he stayed with the word so he wasn't
[1:28:41] saying well I'm I'm here to do the will
[1:28:43] of the father and then not knowing what
[1:28:45] the wheel was
[1:28:46] but he was walking in the light for he
[1:28:48] was the light
[1:28:50] but then he turns around says but you
[1:28:51] are the light can you say man you're the
[1:28:54] light Children of the light now notice
[1:28:56] again we're not a people that that
[1:28:59] living life and not knowing knoweth that
[1:29:03] not no that's not us first John 5 18 we
[1:29:07] know
[1:29:07] I like how they just put these
[1:29:09] certainties there we know that whosoever
[1:29:12] is born of God sinneth not but he that
[1:29:16] is begotten of God keepeth himself
[1:29:19] and that Wicked one toucheth him not and
[1:29:22] we know
[1:29:24] how many knows
[1:29:26] that we are of God
[1:29:28] see and another thing we know that John
[1:29:31] says the one the other thing that we
[1:29:33] know is the whole world lieth in
[1:29:35] wickedness
[1:29:37] so so that there there's no gray area
[1:29:39] ain't that right we know that we're
[1:29:42] children of God sons of God we we know
[1:29:45] that we're born of God we we we know
[1:29:48] these things and yet we know that the
[1:29:51] world is lying in wickedness
[1:29:54] my
[1:29:56] a lot of people don't know that lay
[1:29:58] Odyssey if people don't know that
[1:30:05] and go on in the 20th verse what does he
[1:30:07] else does he say and we know everybody's
[1:30:09] say and we know that the Son of God has
[1:30:12] come and hath given us an understanding
[1:30:15] that we may know him that is true
[1:30:20] I'm so glad we're not in the class of
[1:30:21] North if not
[1:30:24] that we are in the class of we know
[1:30:27] we know that the Son of God Has Come
[1:30:30] we know that he is true
[1:30:33] can you say man he's given us an
[1:30:36] understanding that we may know him that
[1:30:39] is true and we know
[1:30:42] we are in him
[1:30:44] that is true
[1:30:46] even in his son Jesus Christ this is the
[1:30:49] true God and eternal life
[1:30:51] notice what John 15 15 Jesus would say
[1:30:55] and I don't know this you meant
[1:30:57] something special
[1:30:59] to me
[1:31:00] yet he says hence to Jesus is saying
[1:31:02] henceforth I call you not servants
[1:31:05] for the servant knoweth not what his
[1:31:09] Lord doeth
[1:31:10] but I have called you friends
[1:31:13] oh look at even the Walk we're not
[1:31:16] walking as strangers we're not walking
[1:31:18] as a servant
[1:31:20] he even he changes the the our
[1:31:23] relationship those that are walking in
[1:31:26] the paths of righteousness he calls
[1:31:29] friend
[1:31:30] not stranger because the stranger
[1:31:33] knoweth not what his Lord does
[1:31:35] but he says I call you friends for all
[1:31:39] things everybody say all things that I
[1:31:42] have heard of my father I have made
[1:31:44] known
[1:31:45] unto you
[1:31:48] what a relationship
[1:31:54] I hope it helps
[1:31:58] as I get ready to close
[1:32:02] in Deuteronomy the 28th chapter
[1:32:09] one of the things that God told Israel
[1:32:13] would happen if they turned aside from
[1:32:14] his word
[1:32:16] and you ought to go and read that 28th
[1:32:20] chapter
[1:32:22] but one of the things that God told them
[1:32:24] would happen if they turned aside from
[1:32:26] his word was Thou shalt grope at noon
[1:32:30] day
[1:32:31] as the blind gropath in darkness
[1:32:38] turn aside from my word and this would
[1:32:40] be what will happen
[1:32:42] you will grope
[1:32:44] in the noon day
[1:32:46] as the blind groupeth in darkness
[1:32:49] and again Jesus tells or God tells them
[1:32:53] the Commandment is turned not to the
[1:32:55] left
[1:32:56] turn not to the right
[1:32:59] stay in the path
[1:33:01] and and as I I read this uh um this
[1:33:06] tells us then that the paths of
[1:33:08] righteousness is a balanced way
[1:33:15] because he tells us
[1:33:17] don't go left
[1:33:19] and don't turn aside to the right
[1:33:22] stay right there
[1:33:24] it's a balanced the middle of the road
[1:33:29] ain't that right
[1:33:31] now we can't stay in the middle of the
[1:33:33] road without a prophet
[1:33:35] you start being led by Sensations you
[1:33:37] start being led by your feelings you
[1:33:39] start being led by whatever emotions you
[1:33:41] have and you will either go this way or
[1:33:44] you'll go that right this route
[1:33:46] stay with that message
[1:33:50] can you say man
[1:33:51] that's right see so the bride of Christ
[1:33:54] is walking in the middle of two extremes
[1:33:59] in the middle of the road stands the
[1:34:01] bride of Christ walking
[1:34:04] between two extremes right now brother
[1:34:07] Brandon says right in the middle of the
[1:34:08] road there's a true sound where's it at
[1:34:12] in the middle of the road there's a true
[1:34:14] sound unadulterated gospel and power of
[1:34:17] God
[1:34:19] that's right see right down through
[1:34:22] there taking the Kings and monarchs
[1:34:24] where where anybody can stand and search
[1:34:27] and they can see if it's the power of
[1:34:30] almighty God uh see that it's the power
[1:34:33] of almighty God not a fanaticism not a
[1:34:36] formality it's the power of God and
[1:34:39] where is it in the middle of the road
[1:34:42] ain't that right
[1:34:44] I'm going to close but I hope it's the
[1:34:47] help I hope it's all right
[1:34:49] Proverbs 15 10 correction
[1:34:52] now notice correction is Grievous
[1:34:57] to him that forsaketh the way
[1:35:04] when a man
[1:35:06] turns aside
[1:35:10] in all reality he's gone the way of
[1:35:12] Darkness
[1:35:15] correction is Grievous unto him and he
[1:35:19] hateth
[1:35:20] he that hateth reproof shall die
[1:35:27] there's one thing about children of God
[1:35:28] they love reproof
[1:35:31] they love correction because what's the
[1:35:34] purpose of it keeping us balanced
[1:35:36] keeping us on the straight and narrow
[1:35:38] ain't that right but a person that don't
[1:35:41] care about the things of God they don't
[1:35:43] care truth they don't want to know they
[1:35:46] don't they they don't care about how
[1:35:48] they conduct and and how they they that
[1:35:50] about their thoughts or their nature or
[1:35:53] their character they they're not out to
[1:35:55] build they're it's only a kingdom for
[1:35:57] themselves they're not here for their
[1:35:59] own to build their character because if
[1:36:01] you build character there's a lot of
[1:36:03] shaping
[1:36:05] and there's only one character that will
[1:36:07] be accepted and that's the character of
[1:36:08] Jesus Christ
[1:36:10] which is word right
[1:36:13] and so a person that is not interested
[1:36:16] in building the character and moding
[1:36:18] that character and that nature and their
[1:36:19] conduct and everything to the word of
[1:36:21] God in other words walking the paths of
[1:36:23] righteousness then reproof he hates that
[1:36:26] reproof
[1:36:28] correction becomes Grievous to him
[1:36:36] and be honest it's because there's a
[1:36:38] rebelling
[1:36:40] and Rebellion is the sin of witchcraft
[1:36:44] right
[1:36:47] so there is a quite a a contrast quite a
[1:36:52] contrast between the two paths
[1:36:56] and if you'll notice each path affects
[1:36:58] those who walk in it first Samuel 2 and
[1:37:01] 9 says he will keep the feet of his
[1:37:03] Saints
[1:37:05] and the wicked shall be silent in
[1:37:07] darkness for by strength shall no man
[1:37:09] prevail
[1:37:12] if you look in John 8 12 Jesus said I am
[1:37:14] the light of the world and he that
[1:37:16] followeth me shall not walk in darkness
[1:37:19] but shall have the light of life
[1:37:23] can you say man
[1:37:25] do you love the Lord
[1:37:27] if the musicians will come I've got a
[1:37:29] lot more to go but I I don't want to
[1:37:32] keep you
[1:37:34] I appreciate your patience
[1:37:37] but we find that Jesus promised that the
[1:37:39] spirit of Truth when he would come he
[1:37:41] would lead and guide us into all truth
[1:37:43] ain't that right
[1:37:48] and we know that's Jesus Christ himself
[1:37:50] where he said I'm the great Shepherd
[1:37:53] so you don't have two leaders
[1:37:57] you have one
[1:38:00] Proverbs 2 6
[1:38:08] and I'm going to read this here chapter
[1:38:12] that Proverbs 2 6 it says for the lord
[1:38:14] giveth wisdom
[1:38:16] and out of his mouth cometh knowledge
[1:38:18] and understanding
[1:38:21] he layeth up sound wisdom for the
[1:38:25] righteous
[1:38:26] he is a buckler looked up that word
[1:38:28] buckler it's a shield protector
[1:38:31] he is a protector a shield to them that
[1:38:35] walk uprightly
[1:38:37] he keepeth the paths of judgment and
[1:38:40] preserveth the way
[1:38:43] of his Saints aren't you glad he's
[1:38:45] preserved it
[1:38:46] now how would he have done that
[1:38:49] through Malachi 4.
[1:38:52] through the opening of the seals
[1:38:55] he's come to he preserved the way
[1:38:58] it had been so contaminated throughout
[1:39:01] the ages and the church ages and we we
[1:39:03] wouldn't have known what to believe but
[1:39:05] he preserved the way
[1:39:09] can you say Amen
[1:39:11] he preserveth the way of his Saints
[1:39:15] then
[1:39:16] then shalt thou understand righteousness
[1:39:20] and judgment and Equity yay every good
[1:39:25] path
[1:39:26] when wisdom entereth into thine heart
[1:39:29] and knowledge is Pleasant unto thy Soul
[1:39:33] discretion
[1:39:36] that word discretion means good judgment
[1:39:39] able to make responsible decisions
[1:39:43] now look where we have come to church we
[1:39:46] we've not come to infant children
[1:39:49] we are we've come to maturity this is
[1:39:52] the age of maturity
[1:39:54] and and you you and I know good and well
[1:39:58] the difference of responsibility that a
[1:40:02] little child would have versus an adult
[1:40:06] totally different responsibilities
[1:40:09] and and here so so we're finding
[1:40:13] that when wisdom entereth into thine
[1:40:15] heart and knowledge
[1:40:16] is Pleasant unto thy soul
[1:40:20] good judgment discretion
[1:40:24] one that is able to make good
[1:40:27] decisions responsible decisions shall
[1:40:30] preserve thee and understanding shall
[1:40:33] keep thee in other words you're not
[1:40:35] going to be wrapped up somewhere
[1:40:39] I wish I wish I could just talk to the
[1:40:41] world about that
[1:40:43] wish I could talk to so many young
[1:40:45] people
[1:40:46] when you see them starting to head off
[1:40:48] of a path and you know
[1:40:50] if God by God's grace if they don't if
[1:40:53] somehow he doesn't get their attention
[1:40:55] they're going to go off somewhere
[1:40:59] and then the Perez
[1:41:01] and end up in in a mess
[1:41:04] but here he says see the understanding
[1:41:08] shall keep thee
[1:41:10] discretion shall preserve thee
[1:41:13] you're not going to go to get to the end
[1:41:15] and only to find out you run in vain
[1:41:18] why you've been able to make responsible
[1:41:21] decisions
[1:41:22] you've been able to make good judgment
[1:41:25] for you're walking the paths of
[1:41:27] righteousness
[1:41:28] can you say man
[1:41:31] so discretion shall preserve the
[1:41:33] understanding shall keep thee to deliver
[1:41:35] thee from the way of the evil man from
[1:41:39] the man that speak it forward or
[1:41:41] perverse corrupt things can you say Amen
[1:41:46] oh God bless you
[1:41:48] amen pray that it was a help to you
[1:41:51] tonight made some sense I love the Lord
[1:41:55] Lead Me Lord

[1:44:30] I
[1:44:32] as they just play Softly
[1:44:34] thought of this quote brother Bram said
[1:44:37] God works through human beings
[1:44:39] to redeem human beings
[1:44:42] he can take you work through you to
[1:44:45] redeem Humanity if you'll completely
[1:44:47] dedicate everything you are
[1:44:50] if you're a young woman dedicate your
[1:44:52] morals
[1:44:53] your young man dedicate your morals
[1:44:56] dedicate your mind dedicate your
[1:44:59] thinking dedicate your heart
[1:45:01] dedicate your soul
[1:45:03] dedicate all you are and let Christ work
[1:45:07] through that
[1:45:08] what a glorious thing
[1:45:10] got the rivers to cross
[1:45:13] you got Bridges to go over
