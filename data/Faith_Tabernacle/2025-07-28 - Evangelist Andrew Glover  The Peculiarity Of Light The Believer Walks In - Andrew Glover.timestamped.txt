[21:51] and shake your neighbor by the hand and
[21:52] say, "We're rising up." Well, if you
[21:55] think it's all long and gone and the
[21:58] miracles are done,
[22:01] I have some good news to bring to you.
[22:05] Oh, he said in the last days he'll pour
[22:09] of his spirit more and more. Oh, like a
[22:13] mighty eagle, my strength is renewed.

[44:45] many things and he he didn't have to do
[44:49] that, but he just shows his love to us
[44:52] and uh we're certainly glad for that.

[51:19] he is able to come today and really
[51:21] looking forward to what God has in
[51:23] store. Amen. And you know, it's not the
[51:26] gift. Uh God places a gift in a man's
[51:29] life, but as we've been taught many
[51:32] times, you operate the gift. And if you
[51:34] have a need this morning, uh God knows
[51:37] how to speak to you. I mean, he he just
[51:40] know he does that, right? And um uh
[51:43] we've seen that time and again. And and
[51:46] uh God can move a minister off his notes
[51:48] and just come right walking down your
[51:50] alley and give you exactly what you
[51:54] need. And that's just the kind of God we
[51:56] serve. Amen. And I'm glad there's
[51:58] ministers that believe that way. Amen.
[52:00] That just want to yield themselves to
[52:03] the Lord and let the Lord operate
[52:05] through them. And uh so let's stand to
[52:08] our feet. And uh we want Brother Andrew
[52:11] just to uh uh take his liberty, preach
[52:14] whatever the Lord has laid on his heart.
[52:16] And good to have brother Will, sister
[52:18] Hope, Sister Becky, and the boys back
[52:20] with us. Amen. and uh just everyone and
[52:24] Darl and uh good to have you back with
[52:27] us and uh just uh I I there might have
[52:31] been others that were missing last week
[52:33] and if I've missed you, we're glad to
[52:35] have you, too. So, uh but uh anyways,
[52:39] but let's just uh sing that song, Keep
[52:40] on Walking, and uh we'll just do the
[52:43] chorus.
[52:45] Oh, keep on walking.
[52:49] You don't know how far you come. Keep on
[52:53] walking.
[52:56] All you know it may be done. And the
[53:00] father
[53:02] may be standing up right now to give the
[53:06] call
[53:09] to end it all.
[53:11] Oh, keep on walking.
[53:14] [Music]
[53:16] Sing it now. Oh, keep on walking. How
[53:20] many's going to keep on walking? You
[53:22] don't know how far you've come. Keep on
[53:26] walking.
[53:28] Oh, you know the may be done. And the
[53:32] father
[53:33] [Music]
[53:35] may be standing up right now to give the
[53:38] call. We could be going home any time.
[53:42] You may not even go to bed tonight. You
[53:45] can be in heaven. You can be in a new
[53:47] body by the time this day is over with.
[53:50] Oh, keep on walking.
[53:53] Oh, you don't know how far you come.
[53:57] Keep on walking
[54:00] and all you know it may be done and the
[54:04] far
[54:09] [Music]
[54:12] to end it all.
[54:15] So keep on walking.
[54:21] [Music]
[54:22] Keep on walking.
[54:27] Amen. How many can testify this morning?
[54:29] You just going to keep on walking. Amen.
[54:32] We just hearing that song sung this
[54:35] morning. And Amen. I know Paul tells us
[54:37] in the Bible, he says, "Be not weary and
[54:39] welloing." And I love what he says. He
[54:41] says, "Cuz in due season you'll reap if
[54:44] you faint not." Amen. And I believe
[54:46] today if we just lay down and quit,
[54:47] we're never going to reap anything. But
[54:49] if we just keep on walking, Amen. Before
[54:51] long, the Holy Spirit will come by and
[54:53] he'll just touch our heart and give us
[54:55] strength. Amen. Amen. God bless you this
[54:57] morning. How many is happy to be a
[54:59] Christian? Amen. How many is happy to be
[55:01] in the house of God? Amen. We say God
[55:03] bless you all this morning. The
[55:05] musicians can be dismissed. We sure
[55:07] enjoyed the song service this morning
[55:09] and the the worship of the Lord. And I
[55:11] tell you, there's nothing like it when
[55:13] believers begin to worship God. Amen.
[55:15] And they begin to praise him and Amen.
[55:17] Not just praising him because
[55:19] everything's going good or because
[55:21] everything's going right, but praising
[55:23] him because he's worthy to be praised.
[55:25] Amen. Regardless of what we're facing or
[55:28] what we're going through, we have this
[55:30] confidence that God is worthy of all of
[55:32] our praise. And Amen. And I was just
[55:34] down there this morning in the in the
[55:36] back room here. And brother Shawn
[55:37] mentioned uh some of the different
[55:39] things the different believers are going
[55:40] through here. And the prophet of God
[55:42] just laid it on my or the the Lord laid
[55:44] this quote on my heart from the prophet
[55:45] of God. He said, you know, he said, "The
[55:48] church is not suffering and it's not
[55:49] being tried." He said, "Hasn't God? It
[55:52] it isn't of God." And as brother Sean
[55:54] was speaking there, I just tell that
[55:55] devil, Amen, this church is of God.
[55:57] Amen. If you're struggling and and
[56:00] fighting and battling, Amen. It's a sign
[56:02] that you got something the devil wants.
[56:04] Amen. But we're not going to give up
[56:05] what God has given us. Amen. We we sure
[56:08] thank the Lord and sure praying for all
[56:10] those that are sick and suffering. And
[56:12] Amen. I know the Lord is still a healer
[56:14] and a deliverer and amen. He's a way
[56:16] maker and just want to say God bless you
[56:18] all this morning. It's a real honor to
[56:20] be here with you today and to see
[56:22] everyone again the house of God. We sure
[56:24] love and appreciate you all and
[56:26] appreciate the opportunity to stand here
[56:28] once again and speak to you. And we
[56:30] appreciate brother Shawn, his friendship
[56:31] and his stand for this message. And
[56:33] amen, just been a real friend and a real
[56:36] buddy to us. And amen, sometimes I
[56:39] sometimes I think I probably should
[56:40] leave him alone. I probably bug him a
[56:42] lot, but Amen. We sure love Brother Sean
[56:45] and sure love him. And Amen. I
[56:47] appreciate men of God that'll take the
[56:48] gloves off and just preach this message.
[56:50] Amen. And we sure appreciate that the
[56:52] family here. And sure glad to have my
[56:54] wife and Malachi with us. And amen,
[56:56] we're we've just been out for a few days
[56:58] at brother Mike Walls there for his
[57:00] youth camp and amen, brother Judah went
[57:02] with us up there and we just had a
[57:04] wonderful time there and I know the Lord
[57:06] has something in store for us here this
[57:08] morning and maybe we just bow our hearts
[57:09] for a word of prayer and we just speak
[57:11] to the author before we open the word
[57:13] here this morning. Uh we believe God
[57:16] speaks, don't we? Let's ask him to speak
[57:18] to us. Heavenly Father, Lord, as your
[57:20] believers have gathered here this
[57:22] morning, Father, we have gathered here
[57:24] with great expectation and anticipation
[57:26] in our hearts, Lord, to be in your
[57:29] presence and to be with believers of
[57:31] like precious faith. Lord, knowing that
[57:33] when two or three gather together in
[57:35] your name, Lord, you made a divine
[57:37] promise that you would come and be in
[57:39] our midst. And Father, I know this
[57:41] morning there's many that would love to
[57:43] be here, but Lord, the enemy has
[57:45] afflicted their bodies. But Lord, we
[57:47] stand here this morning in the gap as it
[57:49] were, Father. Lord, believing that
[57:51] you're a healer, believing that you're a
[57:53] deliverer, oh God. Lord, we know that
[57:56] your word is not limited or restricted
[57:58] to the four walls of a building, Father.
[58:00] But Lord, we believe that as your word
[58:02] goes forth here this morning, it can go
[58:04] to the different homes, Father. Lord, it
[58:07] can touch those, Lord. It can drive
[58:08] sicknesses out of bodies, Father. Lord,
[58:11] things that have appeared on scans and
[58:13] Lord have showed up on tests, Father. I
[58:15] believe that as your word goes forth,
[58:17] they can disappear. Lord, I believe your
[58:19] word can dissolve it, Father. Now, Lord,
[58:22] this morning, I pray as we endeavor to
[58:24] look into your word, Lord, you see these
[58:26] things that you've brought our attention
[58:28] to this morning. Father, I pray some way
[58:30] somehow that you would help me to get
[58:32] myself out of the way, Lord. That you
[58:35] could come among your church today and
[58:36] speak to the needs of your children.
[58:38] Father, forgive us of our failures,
[58:40] Lord. Forgive us of our shortcomings,
[58:42] dear God. Lord, may the blood just flow
[58:45] through this building this morning
[58:46] transforming our hearts and lives, Lord.
[58:49] And Father, if maybe one has been in a
[58:51] battle for a long time and Lord, their
[58:53] confession is becoming weak. I pray
[58:55] today, Lord, that you would return the
[58:57] strength, oh God, of the confession of
[58:59] our faith in the finished work of
[59:01] Calvary. Now Lord, we commit this
[59:03] meeting today into thy faithful hands.
[59:05] Bless your children. We pray in Jesus
[59:08] Christ's name we ask all these things.
[59:10] and all the believers says
[59:12] &gt;&gt; amen and amen. If you have your Bibles
[59:15] today, we will invite you to the book of
[59:17] Colossians the 2 chapter. The book of
[59:20] Colossians the 2 chapter. We uh do want
[59:22] to bring you greetings there from
[59:23] Brother Matt and the church in Arkansas
[59:25] there, Grace Tabernacle. Brother Matt
[59:27] said to be sure and greet brother Shawn.
[59:29] And so we want to do that this morning.
[59:31] We we sure love the Lord here today.
[59:33] Amen. Colossians chapter 2 and verse
[59:37] number six. And then also we're going to
[59:40] read in the book of Peter as well as the
[59:42] book of first John. You love the Lord
[59:44] this morning. Amen. Colossians chapter 2
[59:46] and verse 6. Paul here writing, he says,
[59:49] "As ye have therefore received Christ
[59:53] Jesus the Lord, so walk ye in him." I
[59:58] love that. How many has received Christ
[1:00:00] Jesus the Lord?
[1:00:02] &gt;&gt; If you have received him, Paul says, "So
[1:00:04] walk ye in him." Now in the book of 1
[1:00:08] Peter, 1 Peter chapter 2 and verse
[1:00:11] number nine, it's a very very familiar
[1:00:14] reading. 1 Peter chapter 2 and verse 9.
[1:00:17] Peter here writing, he says, "But ye are
[1:00:19] a chosen generation. You are a royal
[1:00:22] priesthood and holy nation, a peculiar
[1:00:25] people, that ye should show forth the
[1:00:28] praises of him who hath called you out
[1:00:31] of darkness into his marvelous light,
[1:00:35] which in time past were not a people,
[1:00:38] but are now the people of God, which had
[1:00:41] not obtained mercy, but now have
[1:00:44] obtained mercy. Amen. I love that. We
[1:00:47] are a peculiar people that one time had
[1:00:50] not obtained mercy but now have obtained
[1:00:53] mercy. And also in the book of 1 John
[1:00:55] chapter 1, 1 John chapter 1 and verse
[1:00:58] number uh five, this is probably one of
[1:01:01] my favorite verses in the in the Bible.
[1:01:03] 1 John chapter 1 and verse number five.
[1:01:06] Uh here John is writing to the church
[1:01:08] and he says now this then is the message
[1:01:11] which you have heard of him and declare
[1:01:14] unto you that God is light and in him is
[1:01:18] no darkness at all. How many's thankful
[1:01:20] for that?
[1:01:21] &gt;&gt; If we say that we have fellowship with
[1:01:24] him and walk in darkness, we lie and do
[1:01:27] not the truth. But if we walk in the
[1:01:30] light as he is in the light, we have
[1:01:33] fellowship one with another and the
[1:01:36] blood of Jesus Christ his son cleanseth
[1:01:40] us from all sin. Amen. We ask the Lord
[1:01:43] this morning to bless the reading of his
[1:01:44] word as you can have your seats here
[1:01:46] today if I would if I would take a title
[1:01:49] from those passages of scripture we've
[1:01:50] read this morning. I want to talk to you
[1:01:52] for just a few moments today on this.
[1:01:55] the peculiarity of light the believer
[1:01:57] walks in. The peculiarity of light the
[1:02:00] believer walks in. And you know, as we
[1:02:03] are here this morning as Christians and
[1:02:05] as believers, as as sons and daughters
[1:02:07] of God, pursuing the things of God, uh
[1:02:10] there's one thing I find that the enemy
[1:02:12] is trying to do, amen, is the enemy is
[1:02:15] trying to slow every one of us down.
[1:02:17] Amen. The devil knows that we're not
[1:02:19] just here uh walking or we're not just
[1:02:21] here taking up time, but the devil knows
[1:02:24] that we're actually a people that has
[1:02:26] been brought up on the earth by
[1:02:27] predestination. And we have what the
[1:02:30] Bible would call an expected end. So
[1:02:32] we're not just aimlessly wandering
[1:02:34] through life, but rather God, amen, has
[1:02:36] given us a destination. He has given us
[1:02:39] an expected end. And brother Brandon
[1:02:41] will say some very powerful things
[1:02:43] concerning our walk. He will he will
[1:02:45] show us that our walk is actually an
[1:02:47] identification. It's al it's also a
[1:02:50] reflection. In 1955 he says our walk and
[1:02:53] our associations with people. He said
[1:02:55] that people would recognize that we were
[1:02:58] children of the king. Another place he
[1:03:01] said our walk ought to be plain to the
[1:03:03] public. Holy, holy, holy unto the Lord.
[1:03:06] Again he would say don't try to have any
[1:03:08] sensation or anything take the place of
[1:03:10] the Holy Spirit. When the new birth has
[1:03:12] come, you are changed. See, you don't
[1:03:15] have to do anything to prove it. Amen.
[1:03:17] Your life proves it as you walk. See,
[1:03:20] your love and peace and longsuffering,
[1:03:22] gentleness, meekness, patience, he said,
[1:03:25] that's what you are. And the whole world
[1:03:28] sees the reflection of Jesus Christ in
[1:03:31] you. Amen. So not by our by our words or
[1:03:34] by our sermons or by our songs or amen
[1:03:37] not even by the clothes we wear or the
[1:03:38] church we go to but rather by our walk.
[1:03:41] Amen. Our associates are able to see
[1:03:44] amen the identification and the
[1:03:46] reflection of Jesus Christ in the token.
[1:03:48] He said but see instead of him being a
[1:03:50] human being amen it was a super super
[1:03:53] super human being. He said, "And that
[1:03:56] makes the human being now, Amen, not
[1:03:59] only a human being, but he's a son and
[1:04:02] daughter of God of the super super super
[1:04:06] life, amen, that was in him has come
[1:04:09] back up on you and changes you from a
[1:04:11] sinner and the things of the world, a
[1:04:14] church member, a denominational goer,
[1:04:16] amen, to be a bornagain Christian filled
[1:04:19] with the spirit and the life of God just
[1:04:22] flowing from you like sparks from an
[1:04:24] anvil. people. Amen. As you walk full of
[1:04:27] virtue and love and gentleness as the
[1:04:29] Holy Spirit is moving and speaking.
[1:04:32] Amen. There you are. And with what?
[1:04:35] Hearing the message, watching the pillar
[1:04:36] of fire. Amen. Having the blessed
[1:04:39] assurance I have passed. Amen. From
[1:04:41] death unto life. Amen. I love what he
[1:04:44] says. And as you walk, Amen. you have
[1:04:46] confidence that the life of Christ is in
[1:04:49] you. Amen. And you are in him. See,
[1:04:52] you've got to be born again. And and
[1:04:54] when you're born again, you walk in
[1:04:56] Bible lights. Amen. Amen. And you do
[1:04:59] what the Bible says. So, Amen. When
[1:05:01] you're born again, you're no longer
[1:05:03] walking in the light of your first
[1:05:05] birth. Amen. But rather, you're walking
[1:05:07] in the light of the Bible. Now, Amen. I
[1:05:09] just want to read to you First John 1:7
[1:05:11] from the Amplified Bible. It says, "But
[1:05:14] if we really walk in the light, that is
[1:05:16] live each and every day in the
[1:05:18] conformity with the precepts of God as
[1:05:22] he himself is in the light." He said,
[1:05:24] "We have true unbroken fellowship with
[1:05:27] one another. He with us and we with
[1:05:29] him." And the blood of Jesus his son,
[1:05:32] amen, cleanses us from all sin. Now, how
[1:05:35] does he do that? by erasing the stain of
[1:05:39] sin and keeping us cleansed from sin in
[1:05:42] all its forms and all of its
[1:05:44] manifestation. So, amen, this morning,
[1:05:46] we're not guessing what sin is. We know,
[1:05:49] amen, that sin is unbelief, right? Amen.
[1:05:52] And sin is unbelief, and unbelief is
[1:05:54] what tries to stop us, amen, from
[1:05:57] possessing the promises of God. Now,
[1:05:59] brother Ram, in 1956, he preaches a a
[1:06:02] very powerful sermon, and he calls it,
[1:06:04] "Why are people so tossed about?" He
[1:06:07] said, "I believe we're living in a very
[1:06:09] wonderful, glorious day of opportunity
[1:06:11] when the people of this day are living,
[1:06:14] amen, to see the shadows of the coming
[1:06:16] of the son of God." He said, "I believe
[1:06:18] with all my heart that the world is
[1:06:21] going to burst now into the greatest
[1:06:23] revival that was ever known or it's
[1:06:26] going into the darkest chaos that has
[1:06:28] ever been known in history." So here,
[1:06:31] amen, the world is standing on the
[1:06:33] brink, amen, of the greatest revival
[1:06:36] it's ever known or the greatest chaos
[1:06:38] it's ever seen. Now, you all that study
[1:06:40] the message know, amen, that 1956 was a
[1:06:44] turning year in the ministry and the
[1:06:46] message of William Brandon. He said this
[1:06:48] is the year they'll either accept the
[1:06:50] message or they will reject the message.
[1:06:52] And he said, now it's a great time of
[1:06:54] people, amen, to make a decision on what
[1:06:57] they're going to do. Now, what I love
[1:06:59] about that, amen, is the decision that
[1:07:02] America makes or the world makes in
[1:07:04] general, amen, does not determine that
[1:07:07] the decision, Amen, that an individual
[1:07:09] makes. See, amen. We're living in a
[1:07:12] world that turn down the message. They
[1:07:14] turn down the lights. They turn down the
[1:07:16] gospel. Amen. But we're not here this
[1:07:18] morning, Amen, in the greatest chaos of
[1:07:21] our life. But we're here in the greatest
[1:07:23] revival of our life. Amen. Because this
[1:07:26] is not a universal revival folks. Amen.
[1:07:29] It's not a church revival but this is a
[1:07:32] individual bride's revival that is
[1:07:34] burning in the hearts of individual. He
[1:07:37] said many times spiritual people amen
[1:07:40] are misunderstood. Amen. To the peoples
[1:07:42] of the world. Amen. Because it's such a
[1:07:45] strange and an odd life. Amen. It's a
[1:07:48] strange and odd life to live. Amen. A
[1:07:51] full surrendered life to the Lord Jesus.
[1:07:54] How many will agree that it's a strange,
[1:07:57] amen, an odd thing to the world, amen,
[1:07:59] to live a full and surrendered life to
[1:08:02] Jesus. Now, you know why that's strange
[1:08:03] to the world, don't you? Amen. Because
[1:08:05] they turned down the gospel and they
[1:08:08] went into chaos. Amen. But you accepted
[1:08:10] what God was sending and you moved from
[1:08:13] from chaos into revival. Now, amen. This
[1:08:16] morning as we gather here, Amen. We're
[1:08:18] not gathered as just mere church
[1:08:20] members, but I I believe we're gathered
[1:08:22] here as believers. And I I have to say
[1:08:24] what Paul said. He said, "I am become a
[1:08:26] fool in glory, and ye have compelled me,
[1:08:30] for I ought to have been commended of
[1:08:31] you, for in nothing am I behind the very
[1:08:34] chief apostle." Amen. Though I be
[1:08:36] nothing. Now, Brother Bren picks that
[1:08:38] scripture up and he preaches a sermon
[1:08:40] called the oddball. And he said, "See, a
[1:08:43] strange thing for an apostle to say,
[1:08:45] amen, I have become a fool." He said,
[1:08:48] "Now a fool is a person, amen, that
[1:08:51] really isn't in their right mind." He
[1:08:54] said, "How would this apostle say such a
[1:08:56] thing as I have become a fool?" He said,
[1:08:58] "Well, see, on one side to the people,
[1:09:00] you're a fool, and on the other side to
[1:09:03] the people, you're a fool." He said,
[1:09:04] "But you have to be somebody's fool. So,
[1:09:07] I would rather be a fool for Christ."
[1:09:10] Because God said his people, Amen, were
[1:09:13] a peculiar odd, chosen, elected, a royal
[1:09:17] priesthood offering spiritual sacrifices
[1:09:19] to God. Amen. That is the fruit of our
[1:09:22] lips. Amen. Giving praise to his name.
[1:09:25] Now, in that sermon, why are people so
[1:09:27] tossed about? I found this quote and it
[1:09:29] really just jumped out at me. He said, I
[1:09:32] want you to notice another thing about
[1:09:33] this. Amen. Is the peculiar of the light
[1:09:37] the believer walks in when he's in
[1:09:39] Christ. Amen. The peculiarity of it. So
[1:09:42] I say this, not only is a believer,
[1:09:45] Amen, a peculiar person, Amen. But the
[1:09:48] light they walk in is peculiar, Amen.
[1:09:51] compared to the light the rest of the
[1:09:53] world they're living around is walking
[1:09:55] in. Now, Brother B says it beautiful. He
[1:09:57] said, "Oh, Father, you've taken
[1:09:59] alcoholics and you've taken prostitutes.
[1:10:01] Sorry. You've taken dope things and you
[1:10:04] brought them, watch this, you brought
[1:10:06] them out of every walk of life." Amen.
[1:10:09] How many can testify that God, amen,
[1:10:11] brought you out of every walk of life
[1:10:14] and you made them ladies and gentlemen
[1:10:16] out of them. He said, now what does
[1:10:18] Exodus mean? It means a called out. See,
[1:10:21] Amen. the church. Now, God is calling
[1:10:24] his people out of every walk of life to
[1:10:27] come and to receive him and to believe
[1:10:30] on him. Now, amen, church, that that
[1:10:33] God, Amen, he's not calling the devil's
[1:10:35] people. Amen. He's not calling the
[1:10:37] serpent seed, but he is calling his
[1:10:40] people, amen, out of every walk of life,
[1:10:43] amen, to come and to receive him and to
[1:10:46] believe on him. I want to tell you this
[1:10:48] morning, there there is a vast
[1:10:50] difference, amen, in the believer's
[1:10:52] walk, amen, and the modern Christian
[1:10:54] walk.
[1:10:55] &gt;&gt; Y'all know that, Amen. There's a vast
[1:10:57] difference, amen, in the believer's walk
[1:11:00] and the modern Christian walk. Brother
[1:11:02] said, "How dreadful does the walk of the
[1:11:04] modern Christian must be before God." He
[1:11:07] said, "How we ought to alter ourselves."
[1:11:09] Amen. Alter our ways. Now, when you look
[1:11:12] here at this word peculiarity, it means
[1:11:14] an odd or an unusual feature or habit.
[1:11:18] It is a characteristic or a quality that
[1:11:21] is distinctive of a particular person or
[1:11:24] place. It is the quality or state of
[1:11:27] being peculiar. Amen. So when you're
[1:11:29] walking in the peculiarity of this
[1:11:31] light, amen, there are different habits
[1:11:34] in you. There are different
[1:11:35] characteristics in you, amen, that are
[1:11:38] not seen in the other people. I love
[1:11:40] that the prophet of God said, "The
[1:11:42] believer walks." Now, Amen. This is very
[1:11:44] simple, but it's on my heart. Amen. The
[1:11:46] believer don't sit. Amen. The believer
[1:11:49] don't lay down. Amen. The believer don't
[1:11:51] back up. The believer don't quit. Amen.
[1:11:53] But the believer walks. Amen. And if
[1:11:56] we're going to walk, then we've got to
[1:11:58] have light. Amen. But before you can
[1:12:00] walk in the light, amen, you've got to
[1:12:02] step in the light. Amen. The prophet of
[1:12:05] God said, "In the light of the angel of
[1:12:06] God," Amen. standing there on that
[1:12:08] mountain that day, everything that Moses
[1:12:11] once had or thought would never happen,
[1:12:13] amen, it come to be a reality. And I
[1:12:17] think if men and women today would ever
[1:12:19] step into the light of the Holy Spirit
[1:12:22] under the uncction of God's spirit and
[1:12:24] the light of God's word, everything God
[1:12:26] promised, Amen, will illuminate to you
[1:12:29] and will be real again. Amen. When Moses
[1:12:33] failed, it was because he lacked having,
[1:12:36] Amen, what the burning bush had. Right?
[1:12:39] &gt;&gt; He said, and that's our failure today is
[1:12:42] lacking having what the Holy Spirit has.
[1:12:44] See, and the Holy Spirit has all good
[1:12:47] things for us. And if we receive the
[1:12:49] Holy Spirit, then all things are
[1:12:52] possible. They're not only possible, but
[1:12:54] they are promised to us. Amen. When we
[1:12:57] step into the light of God's word with
[1:13:00] the uncction of the Holy Spirit to shine
[1:13:03] the light on it, then brother, the
[1:13:05] impossible becomes little things. them.
[1:13:08] He said, "When the word's being preached
[1:13:10] and the Holy Spirit brings the word, he
[1:13:13] energizes that and he flashes the same
[1:13:16] light of God's blessed promise." God
[1:13:19] said, "I have remembered my promise to
[1:13:21] Abraham, to Isaac and Jacob, and I'm
[1:13:24] sending you down there to do it." He
[1:13:26] said, "See, then when God's word, his
[1:13:28] promise becomes enlightened by the
[1:13:31] presence of the angel of the Lord."
[1:13:33] Amen. Stop Moses now. He's on his road.
[1:13:37] Amen. When the light of God's word,
[1:13:40] amen, shines upon the promise of God and
[1:13:43] that promise becomes a reality to the
[1:13:45] believer. Listen, there's not enough
[1:13:47] devils in hell. There's not enough
[1:13:49] sicknesses and symptoms and troubles,
[1:13:51] amen, to back a son and daughter of God,
[1:13:53] amen, off of the promises of God. I
[1:13:56] believe it tonight. I believe this
[1:13:57] morning that light is not coming. I
[1:13:59] believe light is here. And I don't
[1:14:01] believe it's time to look at the light.
[1:14:03] I don't believe it's time to talk about
[1:14:04] the light. I don't believe it's time to
[1:14:06] examine the light. I believe as
[1:14:08] believers, it's time to step into the
[1:14:10] light. And the prophet of God said when
[1:14:12] you step in the light, amen, when you
[1:14:14] see the light, he said, then walk in it.
[1:14:17] Amen. Walk. Don't you know where you're
[1:14:19] going, but just keep on walking. Amen.
[1:14:21] Walking towards Calvary. Amen. Keeping a
[1:14:24] sensible look at Calvary. Brother
[1:14:26] screams out, "Walking." Amen. Walking. I
[1:14:29] love that what he says a few paragraphs
[1:14:31] later. He says, "Let's get on our
[1:14:33] walking shoes, church." Amen. Let's get
[1:14:35] on our walking shoes. Amen. I tell you
[1:14:38] this morning, church. Amen. It ain't
[1:14:39] time because the devil's stolen things
[1:14:41] at Faith Tabernacle. It ain't time to
[1:14:44] back up and start secondguessing your
[1:14:46] praise and second-guessing your word and
[1:14:48] secondguessing your faith. It's time to
[1:14:50] put your walking shoes on and say,
[1:14:52] "Devil, you forever obstacle you can in
[1:14:55] our way." But you're going to see the
[1:14:57] difference between a believer and a
[1:14:58] modern Christian. We're not a bunch of
[1:15:00] hybridized Christians. We are sons and
[1:15:03] daughters of God who have been called
[1:15:05] from the confusion of Leosa, from the
[1:15:07] chaos of this world. And God has set our
[1:15:10] feet on the path to glory. And we're not
[1:15:12] going to take our walking shoes off.
[1:15:14] We're going to keep on walking with a
[1:15:16] sensible look towards Calvary. Yes, sir.
[1:15:19] Brother said it. He said, "Get on our
[1:15:21] walking shoes. It's time to walk,
[1:15:23] church." Amen. I find it amazing in the
[1:15:25] Bible. Amen. That the walk of a
[1:15:27] believer, Amen. It's very important as
[1:15:30] you study through the Bible. Amen. If
[1:15:32] it's okay, I'll share a few with you
[1:15:33] this morning. Amen. There are powerful
[1:15:36] characteristics of a believer's walk.
[1:15:39] Amen. There's not powerful
[1:15:40] characteristics of a modern Christian's
[1:15:43] walk, but there are powerful
[1:15:45] characteristics of a believer's walk. In
[1:15:48] Romans 6 and:4, Paul said, "Therefore we
[1:15:50] are buried with him by baptism into
[1:15:53] death, that like as Christ was raised up
[1:15:55] from the dead by the glory of the
[1:15:57] father, even so we also, amen, should
[1:16:01] walk in the newness of life." Amen. So
[1:16:04] the characteristic of the believer's
[1:16:06] walk, Amen, is they are walking in the
[1:16:09] newness of life. In 2 Corinthians 5:7,
[1:16:12] Paul says, "For we walk by faith and not
[1:16:15] by sight." Amen. So there's another
[1:16:18] characteristic. Amen. Is it's not a walk
[1:16:20] of what we can see. It's a walk of what
[1:16:23] we can believe. Brother Ram said, "If we
[1:16:25] only walk by sight, then we would be
[1:16:28] children of darkness." Sure enough. Now,
[1:16:30] but I'm so glad to know that there is a
[1:16:32] light that shines in every believer's
[1:16:35] heart until the eternal day when Jesus
[1:16:38] shall come. Amen. In Galatians 5:16,
[1:16:41] Paul again, he says, "This I say then,
[1:16:44] Amen. Walk in the spirit and ye shall
[1:16:48] not fulfill, Amen. the lust of the
[1:16:51] flesh. Amen. So this is not a walk of
[1:16:54] the flesh. Amen. But it's a walk of the
[1:16:57] spirit. Amen. In Ephesians 4:1 again,
[1:16:59] Paul, he says, I therefore the prisoner
[1:17:02] of the Lord. I beseech you that ye that
[1:17:05] ye walk worthy of the vocation wherewith
[1:17:08] you are called. Amen. So this walk of a
[1:17:11] believer is a walk of consistency. Amen.
[1:17:14] It's not just walking when it's easy.
[1:17:16] It's not just walking when everything's
[1:17:18] going good. But it's a consistent walk.
[1:17:21] When things are going wrong, you're
[1:17:22] still walking. When things are going
[1:17:24] right, you're still walking. Amen. Paul
[1:17:26] in Colossians 1:10, he said that ye
[1:17:29] might walk worthy of the Lord unto all
[1:17:31] pleasing. Amen. Amen. Being fruitful in
[1:17:34] every good work and increasing in the
[1:17:37] knowledge of God. So as a believer
[1:17:39] walks, folks, they're not decreasing,
[1:17:41] but rather they're increasing in the
[1:17:43] knowledge of God. Another place in 1
[1:17:46] Thessalonians 2:1, Paul again, he said,
[1:17:48] "As you know how we exhorted and
[1:17:50] comforted and charged every one of you
[1:17:52] as a father doth his children that ye
[1:17:55] would walk worthy of God." I tell you, I
[1:17:57] was praying on the way to church, Lord,
[1:17:59] and I am the right channel and pulled up
[1:18:00] here on the parking lot and saw the sign
[1:18:02] out on the road and I said, "Take that,
[1:18:04] devil." Amen. that ye would walk worthy
[1:18:06] of God who has called you into his
[1:18:09] kingdom and glory. Brother B said, now
[1:18:12] now listen to what he says. He says, now
[1:18:14] you say, now do I now walk worthy? He
[1:18:18] said, well, I don't walk worthy. No, but
[1:18:21] Christ in me makes me walk worthy. Well,
[1:18:25] that ought to make you shout, amen.
[1:18:26] Amen. I don't have no ability in my
[1:18:29] flesh, amen, to walk the believer's
[1:18:31] walk. But if Jesus Christ, the son of
[1:18:33] God, come into the soul of a believer by
[1:18:35] the baptism of the Holy Ghost, listen,
[1:18:38] it ain't you walking no more. It ain't
[1:18:40] you taking steps no more. It's Christ in
[1:18:43] you. He's using your feet. He's using
[1:18:45] your hands. He's using your mouth.
[1:18:48] Listen, we're not worthy. But if he
[1:18:49] comes in us, we're worthy.
[1:18:52] &gt;&gt; It's not the holy mountain, it's the
[1:18:54] holy God on the mountain. It's not the
[1:18:56] holy church, it's the holy God in the
[1:18:58] church. It's not the holy people. It's
[1:19:00] the Holy Ghost in the people. See,
[1:19:02] brother said to thy children who is born
[1:19:04] again and filled with the Holy Spirit.
[1:19:07] He said, "God, meek in their hearts and
[1:19:09] let them walk worthy of this great
[1:19:11] calling that we have been called." Amen.
[1:19:14] Going about living for you and teaching
[1:19:17] others and praying for them and
[1:19:19] ministering to the sick and the weward
[1:19:21] and the down and out. So, so God is not
[1:19:24] just calling us, Amen, just to come to a
[1:19:26] birth. Amen. But God is calling for a
[1:19:29] walk of an adoption. Amen. I believe
[1:19:31] that church. I believe this. And don't
[1:19:33] you ever forget it. Okay? There is a
[1:19:35] birth and there is an adoption. And the
[1:19:38] prophet of God said, "Your adoption is
[1:19:40] not your birth." He said, "Your adoption
[1:19:42] is your placing." When you are born of
[1:19:44] the spirit of God, we are sons of God.
[1:19:46] But we were predestinated. Amen. To unto
[1:19:50] adoption. He said, "Now, how was our
[1:19:52] inheritance given to us?" Amen. Through
[1:19:55] what? Predestination. It's for
[1:19:57] knowledge. Amen. How did God know he
[1:20:00] could trust you? Amen. To be a preacher.
[1:20:02] He is for knowledge. Amen. Not he that
[1:20:05] willth or he that runth. But it's God
[1:20:07] that showeth mercy. Is that right? Amen.
[1:20:10] Predestination. Now come on. You let the
[1:20:13] devil beat you down all the time. I'm
[1:20:14] not worthy. I'm not worthy. I'm not
[1:20:16] worthy. I can't be worthy. But somewhere
[1:20:18] or another, folks, you got to get a
[1:20:20] sword in your hand and fight back
[1:20:22] against that devil that's trying to
[1:20:24] displace you as a walk as a son and
[1:20:26] daughter of God. Brother said he knew
[1:20:28] what was in you by predestination. He
[1:20:31] knowed what was in you before you ever
[1:20:33] come on the earth. He knowed what was in
[1:20:35] you before there was ever an earth for
[1:20:36] you to come on. See? Amen. That's him.
[1:20:39] That's the infinite God. Amen. He's not
[1:20:42] finite. He is infinite. Amen. So we're
[1:20:45] not walking. Amen. guessing we're sons
[1:20:47] of God. Guessing we're daughters of God.
[1:20:50] But we're walking underneath an
[1:20:52] authority by the revelation of
[1:20:54] predestination. I didn't place myself on
[1:20:57] this road. I didn't call myself into
[1:20:59] this walk. But God called me from before
[1:21:02] the foundation of the world. Listen. And
[1:21:04] if God called you, he's got a place for
[1:21:07] you. And there ain't no devil can take
[1:21:09] your place. There ain't no sickness can
[1:21:11] take your place. Listen, sickness didn't
[1:21:13] save you. So sickness can't unsave you.
[1:21:16] Amen. Sorrow didn't heal you. So sorrow
[1:21:19] can't unheal you. It was God that saved
[1:21:21] you from before the foundation of the
[1:21:23] world. And it'll be God that'll see you
[1:21:26] all the way to your expected end.
[1:21:28] Hallelujah. This is more than just a
[1:21:30] walk on Sunday morning. This is more
[1:21:32] than just a walk on Wednesday night.
[1:21:34] Amen. Paul says this in Ephesians 5:2.
[1:21:37] He says, "Walk in love
[1:21:40] &gt;&gt; as Christ also hath loved us and hath
[1:21:44] given himself for us an offering and a
[1:21:47] sacrifice to God for a sweet smell and
[1:21:50] savior." So another characteristic then
[1:21:52] of this believer's walk is it's a walk
[1:21:55] of love. In Ephesians 5:15, Paul again
[1:21:59] he said, "See then that ye walk
[1:22:01] circumspectly."
[1:22:02] Amen. Not as fools but as wise. Amen. So
[1:22:06] this believer's walk, amen, is a walk of
[1:22:09] discernment or it's a walk of caution.
[1:22:12] Amen. And and in 1 John 2:6, he that
[1:22:15] saith he abideth in him ought himself
[1:22:17] also so to walk. Amen. Even as he
[1:22:21] walked. So here we find that the
[1:22:23] characteristic of the believer's walk is
[1:22:26] it's a walk in the likeness of Christ.
[1:22:29] So, we're not making our own footsteps,
[1:22:31] church, but rather we're walking in the
[1:22:34] footsteps of the one who's already made
[1:22:36] the way. Amen. I love this. The
[1:22:38] believer's walk, Amen, is a walk of
[1:22:41] illumination. In 1 John 1:7, John said,
[1:22:45] "If we walk in the light as he is in the
[1:22:48] light, we have fellowship one with
[1:22:50] another, and the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:22:52] his son, Amen, cleanseth us from all
[1:22:55] sin." Amen. You know this definition.
[1:22:57] I've used it many times. It's the word
[1:22:59] walk. It means to progress. It means to
[1:23:02] make due use of opportunities. It means
[1:23:04] to regulate one's life. Listen, it means
[1:23:07] to conduct oneself. So there is a way a
[1:23:11] modern Christian, amen, conducts
[1:23:13] himself. And there's a way a believer
[1:23:15] conducts himself. Brother said this. He
[1:23:18] said, "We grow. We mature. We find
[1:23:20] better things. We talk of better things.
[1:23:23] We wear better clothes. We drive a
[1:23:25] better automobile." He said, "See, we're
[1:23:27] progressing, but God cannot progress in
[1:23:30] that way because he was perfect to begin
[1:23:33] with, and perfection cannot progress
[1:23:36] anymore. It's already perfection." Amen.
[1:23:40] Come on. What can you add to perfection?
[1:23:42] It's already perfection. So, he don't
[1:23:45] have to say, "Well, this is a different
[1:23:47] age."
[1:23:48] &gt;&gt; We got a better thought now. If it is,
[1:23:51] he can't be God. So if he is God, what
[1:23:54] he spoke back there, he has to stay with
[1:23:57] it because he was perfect there and is
[1:24:00] perfect now. Come on, church. Amen. If
[1:24:02] God spoke your name in the lamb's book
[1:24:04] of life before the foundation of the
[1:24:07] world all the way back there, before
[1:24:09] time, amen. What makes you think he's
[1:24:12] going to change? Amen. His mind about
[1:24:14] you now said, see what's happening then
[1:24:17] is this is more than just a call. He
[1:24:19] said perfection is calling. Amen. Amen.
[1:24:22] It's a perfect place calling you, Amen,
[1:24:24] to that perfection. Amen. And you have
[1:24:26] to be perfect to get there. See, the
[1:24:29] Bible said, "Amen. Be therefore perfect
[1:24:32] even as your father in heaven is
[1:24:34] perfect." Now, listen, it's a perfect
[1:24:36] kingdom. So, it must be a perfect people
[1:24:39] come because you have to stand and be
[1:24:42] married to a perfect son of God, and you
[1:24:45] must be a perfect bride. So, how can you
[1:24:47] do it through anything else? Amen. But
[1:24:50] the perfect word of God which is the
[1:24:53] waters of separation that washes us from
[1:24:56] our sin. He said, "See the blood."
[1:24:58] Somebody shout the blood. Amen. The
[1:25:00] blood. The word of God. Bleeding blood.
[1:25:03] Amen. To wash the bride in. Yes, sir.
[1:25:06] She stands perfect virgin,
[1:25:08] unadulterated. She never sinned in the
[1:25:11] first place. Come on. Where was the
[1:25:13] first place? It wasn't at the altar,
[1:25:15] church. Amen. It wasn't when you heard
[1:25:17] this message. I believe the first place
[1:25:20] was the mind of God. Amen. That's why a
[1:25:22] prophet could pronounce that you were
[1:25:24] perfect because he was not preaching
[1:25:26] from the realms of human mentality. He
[1:25:29] was preaching from the back part of
[1:25:30] God's mind, which is where you were
[1:25:33] before the foundation of the world. I
[1:25:35] want to tell that devil, there's a
[1:25:37] reason the devil wants you to stop
[1:25:38] walking. There's a reason the devil
[1:25:40] wants you to lay down. It's cuz you're
[1:25:42] not walking into another church age.
[1:25:44] You're not walking into another
[1:25:45] dispensation. We are walking into
[1:25:47] perfection. We are walking to the
[1:25:49] marriage supper of the lamb. We are
[1:25:51] walking to the change of our bodies. We
[1:25:53] are walking to a theophony. We are
[1:25:55] walking to the glories of God where
[1:25:57] there'll be no devil. Where there'll be
[1:25:59] no sin, where there'll be no sickness. I
[1:26:01] charge you this morning, if the devil's
[1:26:03] taking your walking shoes off, kick that
[1:26:06] devil out of the way and put your
[1:26:07] walking shoes back on. It's time to walk
[1:26:10] like you never walked before.
[1:26:13] Yes, sir. It's time to walk. We're
[1:26:15] walking unto perfection, folks.
[1:26:17] &gt;&gt; Yes, we are.
[1:26:18] &gt;&gt; Paul said this. He said, "Leaving the
[1:26:21] principles of the doctrine of Christ.
[1:26:23] Let us go on unto perfection,
[1:26:27] not laying again the foundation of
[1:26:29] repentance from dead works, and of faith
[1:26:31] toward God, of the doctrine of baptisms,
[1:26:33] and of the laying on of hands, and of
[1:26:35] the resurrection of the dead, and of
[1:26:37] eternal judgment." I love what he says.
[1:26:40] And this we will do. We're not going to
[1:26:43] possibly do it, might do it. This we
[1:26:46] will do if God permit. In other words,
[1:26:50] sister faith, if God gives permission,
[1:26:52] we're going on to perfection. But can I
[1:26:55] tell you this? God didn't ask the devil
[1:26:57] if you could go to perfection. God
[1:26:59] didn't ask your problem if you could go
[1:27:01] to perfection. God didn't ask this trial
[1:27:03] if you could go to perfection. Before
[1:27:05] the foundation of the world, God
[1:27:08] determined you were going to perfection.
[1:27:10] God ain't asking the devil for
[1:27:12] permission to heal you. He ain't asking
[1:27:14] the devil permission to bless you. He
[1:27:16] settled this before the foundation of
[1:27:18] the world. It's time to let the light of
[1:27:20] God shine on the promise of God and step
[1:27:23] into the realities of God and let the
[1:27:25] Holy Ghost illuminate him and make him
[1:27:27] real again to our hearts. Yes, sir. I
[1:27:30] hate that old devil. Amen. You say,
[1:27:32] "Hate's a strong word." I hate that
[1:27:34] devil and what he does to God's people.
[1:27:36] I hate them old spirits that try to
[1:27:38] drain God's people from the joy of
[1:27:40] serving God and from the peace of
[1:27:42] knowing the Lord and from the from the
[1:27:44] from the enthusiasm of knowing the
[1:27:46] message of the hour. But God has sent a
[1:27:49] message in this hour and it's a message
[1:27:51] of light. Now said you say Brandham
[1:27:53] Tabernacle we have healings that's
[1:27:55] wonderful. We have visions that's fine.
[1:27:58] You have spiritual dreams. I love what
[1:28:00] he says. He said and sometimes they're
[1:28:02] not so spiritual. He said, "We try to
[1:28:05] help the poor and we do what we can." He
[1:28:07] said, "Oh, that's all all right, but
[1:28:09] that's not what we're talking about now.
[1:28:11] We're entering into another phase. We're
[1:28:15] entering into another phase." So he
[1:28:18] says, "Leaving the doctrine." Oh yes, we
[1:28:20] got the doctrine of Christ. We believe
[1:28:22] he was the son of God is a virgin born.
[1:28:25] We believe that with all these things.
[1:28:27] Amen. That is just wonderful. But
[1:28:30] leaving that, let us go on until
[1:28:32] perfection. Now catch something. He
[1:28:34] didn't say skipping that. He said
[1:28:37] leaving that, let us go on unto
[1:28:40] perfection. Amen. I say this, a prophet
[1:28:42] of God come along in 1956 and he gives
[1:28:45] us a prophetic observation. He says, you
[1:28:48] know, Amen. There's many Christians and
[1:28:50] they're up and they're down. Y'all,
[1:28:51] y'all ever seen people like that? Amen.
[1:28:53] One week they're up, next week they're
[1:28:54] down. One week they can't wait for
[1:28:56] church to be open. Next week you got to
[1:28:58] beg them to come. Y'all know what I'm
[1:28:59] talking about. Amen. Up and down. He
[1:29:01] said, "See, people who seem to be very
[1:29:03] religious, they seem to have such a deep
[1:29:05] desire and daily they search and hunt
[1:29:07] and seek for God and never come to any
[1:29:10] kind of settlement of any kind to where
[1:29:12] they could ever be settled or anchored
[1:29:14] in Christ." Now, Amen. Y'all know me.
[1:29:16] I'm just preaching this morning. Is that
[1:29:17] okay? Amen. I tell you some things I
[1:29:20] found. I found some of the most
[1:29:21] religious people, Amen. have the worst
[1:29:23] church attendance possible.
[1:29:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. They're in one week, half the
[1:29:28] next. Here once, Amen. And what's
[1:29:29] happening is is there's a deep desire in
[1:29:32] their heart to serve God. There's a deep
[1:29:34] desire there to to really love the Lord,
[1:29:37] but that needs some word over that
[1:29:39] desire to bring it into more than just a
[1:29:41] church experience, but to bring it into
[1:29:44] a birth, which will take it to an
[1:29:45] adoption. Said, see, he said, now don't
[1:29:48] get mad at me. Let me just preach, okay?
[1:29:50] He said, "One of them is an intellectual
[1:29:52] or a mental conception of what God has
[1:29:55] said in his word and of Jesus Christ by
[1:29:58] the way of knowledge." Amen. So if a if
[1:30:00] a Christian has a mental or intellectual
[1:30:02] conception by reading the word of God,
[1:30:05] when they go through troubles, they'll
[1:30:07] say, "I know I need to be in the house
[1:30:09] of God." And and when they go through
[1:30:11] problems, they'll say, "I know I need to
[1:30:13] be praying, and I know I need to be
[1:30:15] reading my Bible. I know I need to be
[1:30:17] listening to tapes. I know I need to be
[1:30:19] fellowshipping with God's people. But
[1:30:21] see, they're not bad people. It's just
[1:30:24] coming from an intellectual or a mental
[1:30:26] conception. He said, "But the other one
[1:30:28] is an experimental experience that God
[1:30:31] has given the man in his heart." So when
[1:30:34] they go through those situations, they
[1:30:36] don't sit there and say, "I know I need
[1:30:38] to be praying." They've already been
[1:30:39] praying. They don't say, "I know I need
[1:30:41] to be fellowshipping with God." They've
[1:30:43] already been fellowshipping with God.
[1:30:45] because they're not serving God from
[1:30:47] their spirit or from their flesh.
[1:30:49] They're serving God from their soul. Can
[1:30:52] I tell you this folks? You're never
[1:30:53] going to find the answer to satisfy that
[1:30:55] deep desire in your heart. In the
[1:30:57] schools of theology, the prophet of God
[1:30:59] said they don't have the answer. He said
[1:31:01] they'll teach things and say because you
[1:31:03] didn't shout, because you didn't speak
[1:31:05] with tongues, because you didn't have
[1:31:07] these kind of gifts which I have nothing
[1:31:09] in part or to say against such things.
[1:31:11] But altogether you find these people
[1:31:14] when they do shout or they do speak with
[1:31:16] tongues or some other emotion, they
[1:31:18] still don't seem to be the person that
[1:31:20] they should be. Amen. So shouting does
[1:31:23] not give you this anchor. Amen. Dance in
[1:31:26] the spirit, as much as I love to do it,
[1:31:28] it don't give you this anchor. Speaking
[1:31:30] in tongues don't give you this anchor.
[1:31:32] There's only one thing that can give a
[1:31:34] man this anchor, and that's a death to
[1:31:36] his own ideas and his own will and his
[1:31:38] own ambitions. and let the power of God
[1:31:40] fill every fiberless bean and put a
[1:31:42] reality in there that this is more than
[1:31:44] just serving God when things are going
[1:31:46] good. This is serving God when we're on
[1:31:48] the ash heap. This is serving God when
[1:31:50] we're at rock bottom because we're not
[1:31:53] mental conception Christians.
[1:31:56] &gt;&gt; We are experimental experience
[1:31:58] Christians. Amen. I'll say what a
[1:32:00] prophet said. He said, "You do have two
[1:32:02] mental faculties." How many knows that?
[1:32:04] He said, "You got two different mental
[1:32:05] faculties." He said you have one of them
[1:32:08] that's in your head by your brain and
[1:32:10] the other is operated in your heart
[1:32:12] which is called your soul. He said see
[1:32:14] your spirit and your soul. He said now
[1:32:17] they are very much now folks I could
[1:32:19] preach here for an hour. They are very
[1:32:21] much in disagreement many times. He said
[1:32:25] when the head seems to say something the
[1:32:28] soul wonders if it's right or not but
[1:32:31] when it comes into the soul then the
[1:32:33] head seems to step back. Amen. When the
[1:32:36] word comes into the soul, then the
[1:32:39] intellectual has to step back. He said,
[1:32:41] "There's been things that's happened to
[1:32:42] you and you knew that you knew was going
[1:32:45] to be yet you cannot explain why and
[1:32:48] there's no reason you could explain it
[1:32:50] out, but yet you just accepted it and it
[1:32:52] just happened just that way." He said,
[1:32:54] "That's when something happens down
[1:32:57] here." Now, I love it because what he
[1:32:59] does in that sermon, why are people so
[1:33:01] tossed about? He'll take us to the Old
[1:33:04] Testament and he'll bring a a scriptural
[1:33:06] view of this. Amen. Used in the children
[1:33:08] of Israel. Amen. And he'll use the three
[1:33:11] courts in the tabernacle. Remember,
[1:33:12] he'll say, "See, Amen. And the type of
[1:33:14] light that was in each one." Now, I'm
[1:33:17] not going to read this to you. I'm going
[1:33:18] to preach it to you real quick. Okay?
[1:33:19] Amen. There was an outer court, which
[1:33:22] means the believer was still a believer
[1:33:24] in the outer court, but he was walking
[1:33:26] by the sunlight. Amen. See what the
[1:33:29] prophet of God said? He said he's
[1:33:31] justified out here, but he walks by
[1:33:33] daylight. Some days he has gloomy days.
[1:33:36] He said, "Some days you don't know
[1:33:37] whether you're really worthwhile to
[1:33:38] serve God or not." He said, "You're
[1:33:40] walking in the outer courts." He said,
[1:33:42] "Yes, you're a believer. You have
[1:33:45] eternal life. You're his child. But what
[1:33:47] kind of life are you living?" See,
[1:33:50] because the walk you're walking is
[1:33:52] reflecting the life you're living.
[1:33:55] Another place he said, "See what kind of
[1:33:56] light we walking in? It's according to
[1:33:59] the weather." Now, amen. Y'all have
[1:34:00] heard me say it before. Amen. You get up
[1:34:02] on Sunday morning, sun is shining. Amen.
[1:34:05] There's no clouds in the sky, no
[1:34:07] rainfall. You're up at you're up early
[1:34:09] and you're singing and you're making
[1:34:10] coffee and you're fixing breakfast and
[1:34:13] this is going to be a wonderful service
[1:34:14] and the Holy Ghost is going to move. But
[1:34:16] get up on Sunday morning. Let there be
[1:34:18] clouds and let it be real gloomy and let
[1:34:20] it be real dark and that that that now
[1:34:23] come on, we're human. That affects our
[1:34:25] spirit. But see the difference in a
[1:34:27] believer and a modern Christian is we're
[1:34:29] not serving God. Amen. According to the
[1:34:31] weather light. We're not serving God
[1:34:33] according to daylight or sunlight. We're
[1:34:36] we've gone another step further. Re said
[1:34:38] see there's an inner court. He said in
[1:34:40] there the believer walks by the candle
[1:34:42] light which means that seven golden
[1:34:44] candlesticks is given light. He said now
[1:34:47] see he's walking in these seven golden
[1:34:50] candlesticks. There's much light in
[1:34:52] there but there's days when those lights
[1:34:54] get dull. There's days when lamps smoke
[1:34:57] and light's not so good. There's times
[1:34:59] when you have to be relit and you have
[1:35:00] to borrow a little from the neighbor.
[1:35:02] See? Amen. It's all right, but it's
[1:35:04] still not the right light. Now, amen.
[1:35:06] I'll just take a little turn on that
[1:35:08] real quick. Amen. If your favorite
[1:35:10] preachers in town, bless God.
[1:35:13] We're going to have a good meeting
[1:35:14] today, church. Amen. But if a preacher's
[1:35:17] not there and the one you like to hear a
[1:35:18] f, y'all know what I'm talking about.
[1:35:20] Amen. The devil trying to control you.
[1:35:22] Amen. By the candlestick light. But
[1:35:24] listen, that's an artificial light. He
[1:35:26] said, "It's not the light of the sun or
[1:35:29] the moon or the stars." He said, "The
[1:35:30] man in the justified courts when night
[1:35:32] comes, he has a very dim light." Now,
[1:35:35] let me go a step further. He said there
[1:35:37] was an outer court, there was an inner
[1:35:39] court, but then there was the holies of
[1:35:41] holies. He said, "Now see the believer
[1:35:44] walks by, amen, the shakina glory
[1:35:47] light." He said, "See the man who walks
[1:35:49] beyond that and goes in when the world
[1:35:50] is shut off.
[1:35:52] &gt;&gt; When the veil drops around him,
[1:35:56] the great shakina glory, it never got
[1:35:59] dim and it never went out." He said,
[1:36:01] "Now see the kind of light a believer
[1:36:03] walks by, it's kind of a mystic light."
[1:36:06] Amen. It's kind of a soft glowing light
[1:36:08] and the believer is at rest. He's
[1:36:11] walking around inside the veil. Reb
[1:36:13] said, "See, if you ever come into
[1:36:15] Christ, my friend, into a place where
[1:36:17] the world is dead, or whether your
[1:36:19] children are this way, or your mother is
[1:36:21] this way, your daddy said this way, or
[1:36:23] your pastor said that, whether the
[1:36:25] doctor said this or that, you don't even
[1:36:28] hear it because you're living in the
[1:36:30] shakina glory, and you're walking and
[1:36:33] living in the presence of the king." He
[1:36:35] said, "Every day is sweet in your soul."
[1:36:37] And somebody ask you how you doing? You
[1:36:39] say, "All is well." Amen. There's
[1:36:42] nothing can harm you. Let the neighbors
[1:36:44] gossip. I go to church for one thing.
[1:36:47] That's to stay in your presence, Lord. I
[1:36:49] have moved in there, Lord. I'll never
[1:36:51] desire to leave again. I'll trust your
[1:36:53] word. There's where I want to be. Drop
[1:36:56] the veils around me, Lord. Drop the
[1:36:59] veils around me, Lord, that I can see
[1:37:01] Jesus Christ and live and walk and die
[1:37:04] in him. If a man receives Jesus Christ,
[1:37:08] he goes beyond the outer court light. He
[1:37:10] goes beyond the inner court line. He
[1:37:13] moves into the shakina glory. Come on
[1:37:15] folks. You know in that holies of holies
[1:37:17] is also where the shoe bread was, which
[1:37:21] means it was only reserved for an
[1:37:23] elected class of people. I love what
[1:37:25] David said. He said, "Thou hast
[1:37:27] delivered my soul from death." How many
[1:37:29] believes that? Thou hast delivered my
[1:37:31] soul from death. Wilt not thou deliver
[1:37:33] my feet from falling.
[1:37:36] Now come on. We shout about our soul
[1:37:38] passing from death unto life. But look
[1:37:40] what he said. Wilt thou not deliver my
[1:37:43] feet from falling that I may walk before
[1:37:46] God in the light of the living? He says,
[1:37:49] I will walk before the Lord in the land
[1:37:52] of the living. So a believer's walk,
[1:37:55] Amen, walking before the Lord. You're
[1:37:58] not walking in error. You're walking in
[1:38:00] truth.
[1:38:01] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:38:02] &gt;&gt; David says in Psalms 86:11, is this
[1:38:04] okay? He says, "Teach me thy way, O
[1:38:07] Lord. I will walk in thy truth. Unite my
[1:38:10] heart to fear thy name." I love what
[1:38:12] John says in 2 John 1:4. He said, "I
[1:38:15] rejoice greatly that I found of thy
[1:38:17] children walking in truth as we have
[1:38:19] received a commandment from the Father."
[1:38:22] In 3R John 1:3, John again, for I
[1:38:25] rejoice greatly when the brethren came
[1:38:28] and testify of the truth that is in me.
[1:38:30] Now watch this. That is not with thee
[1:38:33] around thee, but the truth that is in
[1:38:35] thee, even as thou walkest in the truth.
[1:38:39] I have no greater joy than to hear that
[1:38:42] my children walk in truth. Look what
[1:38:45] brother Bham said. A man that comes to
[1:38:47] truth and fails to walk in truth than he
[1:38:50] has according to the scripture, he has
[1:38:52] blasphemed or rejected the Holy Spirit
[1:38:55] of God. He said, "I can bring the truth,
[1:38:57] but if you reject it and walk away, I
[1:39:00] know the Bible says if you do that,
[1:39:02] there's no more remission of sin till
[1:39:05] you come and make it right." See, that's
[1:39:07] exactly right. Can you take a profit?
[1:39:10] So, if you see the truth, walk in the
[1:39:13] truth. The minute you see the truth,
[1:39:15] it's time to walk in that truth. The
[1:39:18] minute the word of God tells you, "I'm
[1:39:19] healed." Listen, folks, that's not a
[1:39:22] suggestion. That's the truth. It's time
[1:39:24] to walk in that truth. The minute the
[1:39:26] word of God says you're delivered, says
[1:39:28] you're going in the rapture, says you
[1:39:30] are an overcomer, says you are an
[1:39:32] invincible army, that's not the time to
[1:39:34] question the word, that's the time to
[1:39:36] put your walking shoes on and walk in
[1:39:39] the truth you have received. I love what
[1:39:41] the prophet said. He said, "May God help
[1:39:43] us to know what is truth." How many how
[1:39:45] many say, "Lord, that's my desire. God,
[1:39:47] help us to know what is truth." Listen,
[1:39:50] just to know what's truth. Brother Sean,
[1:39:53] I love this. So we can walk in truth and
[1:39:56] in light. The only reason the prophet
[1:39:59] was wanting truth was not to argue. It
[1:40:02] was not to debate. It was not to see who
[1:40:04] could out preach who and who could out
[1:40:06] quote who. He was desiring truth.
[1:40:08] Brother Shmai, so God's children could
[1:40:11] walk as he walked because he walked in
[1:40:14] truth. Now, how can I talk about walking
[1:40:17] and not mention Enoch? How can I talk
[1:40:20] about walking in truth and not mention
[1:40:22] Enoch? You know what I find? I find
[1:40:24] Enoch is a type of the bride. You know
[1:40:26] that brother said Enoch is a type of the
[1:40:28] bride. He is a type of the believer.
[1:40:30] Amen. Some of y'all probably remember.
[1:40:32] Amen. And you you read the Bible and you
[1:40:34] read the message, you'll find out that
[1:40:35] Enoch, he actually built a pyramid. How
[1:40:38] many knows that Enoch built a pyramid?
[1:40:41] Amen. Now, let me say this, but I want
[1:40:43] you to read Genesis 5:21 with me. Okay?
[1:40:45] Genesis 5:21. And Enoch lived 60 and 5
[1:40:49] years and begat Methuselah. And Enoch
[1:40:52] built a pyramid for God after he begat
[1:40:54] Methusa. And 300,
[1:40:57] are we reading this right?
[1:40:59] And 300 years. And all the days of Enoch
[1:41:01] were 365 and 5 years. Give me verse 24.
[1:41:05] And Enoch built a pyramid for God, and
[1:41:08] he was not, for God took him. Is that
[1:41:11] what the Bible says? No. The Bible says
[1:41:14] that Enoch walked with God. Two times
[1:41:18] the Bible says Enoch walked with God.
[1:41:20] Brother, it don't say Enoch built a
[1:41:22] pyramid. It says Enoch walked with God.
[1:41:26] Look at Hebrews 11:5. By faith Enoch was
[1:41:29] translated that he should not see death
[1:41:31] and was not found because God hath
[1:41:34] translated him. Listen. For before his
[1:41:37] translation, hallelujah. before his
[1:41:41] translation. He had this testimony, he
[1:41:44] pleased God. Listen folks, brother said,
[1:41:48] see, he said, Enoch walked with God.
[1:41:50] Now, I I I want I want to show you
[1:41:52] something, okay? How many's ever been in
[1:41:54] a good hot meeting and the power of God
[1:41:55] falling and the spirit of the Lord
[1:41:57] moving and the preacher get under
[1:41:58] enthusiasm and anointing and he says,
[1:42:00] "Praise God, Enoch, build a pyramid."
[1:42:04] You never hear that, do you? What do you
[1:42:06] hear? We're going to walk like Enoch.
[1:42:08] Enoch walked with God. Now, can I say
[1:42:10] this to you? The most outstanding thing
[1:42:13] is not the fact Enoch built a pyramid.
[1:42:16] It's the fact he walked with God. Now,
[1:42:18] some of y'all probably remember the
[1:42:20] sermon Brother Wayne preached here on
[1:42:21] the pyramid. You remember breaking open
[1:42:23] that pyramid and all the revelation that
[1:42:26] was laying inside that pyramid? Can I
[1:42:28] tell you something? Amen. Now, I know
[1:42:30] folks, Brother Sean, you know him, too.
[1:42:32] And they'll say things like this. We
[1:42:34] don't need all this revelation. We don't
[1:42:35] need all these deep things. We just need
[1:42:37] to preach the Bible. We just need to
[1:42:39] walk with God. Well, pray. Tell me,
[1:42:41] folks. How could Enoch walk with God
[1:42:44] unless he had some revelation to do it
[1:42:46] by? Listen, the most outstanding thing
[1:42:48] about Enoch was not he built a pyramid.
[1:42:51] It was that he walked with God. But the
[1:42:53] reason he could walk with God was
[1:42:56] because he had a revelation that could
[1:42:58] produce a victorious walk in the middle
[1:43:00] of an age of unbelief. What are you
[1:43:03] saying? I'm saying this. Amen. You might
[1:43:05] have never went over there and looked in
[1:43:07] that pyramid. You might have never went
[1:43:08] over there and saw that bread loaf and
[1:43:11] saw that king's chamber and saw all
[1:43:13] those great deep things. But when you
[1:43:15] saw Enoch, what was in the pyramid was
[1:43:17] in Enoch's walk. Because Enoch was not
[1:43:20] walking by his flesh. He was walking by
[1:43:23] light. And light is revelation.
[1:43:26] Hallelujah. You say, "Preacher, you lost
[1:43:28] your mind." No, I haven't. No, I
[1:43:30] haven't. Cuz you're a bunch of Enochs. I
[1:43:33] said you're a bunch of Enochs. And
[1:43:34] there'll be people, they'll never look
[1:43:36] in that deep book called the seven
[1:43:38] seals. They'll never look in that deep
[1:43:40] book called the church ages. They'll
[1:43:42] never break open the future home.
[1:43:44] They'll never hear theophony. They'll
[1:43:46] never hear spiritual food in due season.
[1:43:48] But when you walk down the street, they
[1:43:50] will see an identification of Malachi 4.
[1:43:54] And they will see a reflection of the
[1:43:56] revelation that's been revealed
[1:43:58] underneath the voice of the seventh
[1:43:59] angel in your walk.
[1:44:02] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Brother said it
[1:44:05] beautiful. He said the church, which is
[1:44:07] the type of Enoch, let me let me just
[1:44:09] clear that up, okay? You can't walk
[1:44:11] without revelation.
[1:44:15] You can't walk without revelation. So,
[1:44:19] part for the chorus. Here I go. I'll get
[1:44:21] in trouble. So, for people that say, "We
[1:44:23] don't need all this revelation." We'll
[1:44:25] keep sitting there stumbling around.
[1:44:29] &gt;&gt; You got to have light to walk in, folks.
[1:44:31] If you don't have light, you're going to
[1:44:33] stumble. But if light comes, Hallelujah.
[1:44:36] If light comes, there's a way to walk.
[1:44:40] Brother said the church was just a type
[1:44:41] of Enoch. He said 500 years he walked
[1:44:44] before God, walking in the light with a
[1:44:46] testimony he pleased God. He said, now
[1:44:49] see, God took him away because he was
[1:44:52] walking in the light with a testimony
[1:44:56] that he walked in the light of God. I
[1:44:59] said, "See, just keep walking." In
[1:45:01] Psalms 119:105, David says, "Thy word is
[1:45:05] a lamp unto my feet and a light unto my
[1:45:08] path." Amen. I know you've heard these
[1:45:10] things before. I know you've heard these
[1:45:12] sermons and you've heard these
[1:45:13] scriptures and quotes your whole life. I
[1:45:15] don't really just come here this morning
[1:45:16] to preach a a sermon to you. I want to
[1:45:18] minister to you. Is that okay? It's on
[1:45:20] my heart. The path of the just is as the
[1:45:23] shining light that shineth more and more
[1:45:25] unto the perfect day. He said, "The way
[1:45:28] of the wickedness is darkness. They know
[1:45:30] not at what they stumble." Without
[1:45:33] light, you don't know what you're
[1:45:35] stumbling over. But if light comes,
[1:45:37] there's a direct illumination, brother
[1:45:39] Mark, on the trail to walk from here
[1:45:41] into glory. I'll say this to you
[1:45:44] tonight, folks. Amen. Here's the secret
[1:45:46] of a believer's walk. Amen. The secret
[1:45:48] of a believer's walk is the light
[1:45:51] they're walking in is doing the work.
[1:45:54] Ain't that powerful? the light they're
[1:45:56] walking in is doing the work. Remember
[1:45:59] told the story about the man who didn't
[1:46:00] believe in divine healing.
[1:46:03] He said, "Come go with me to my house."
[1:46:05] Reb said, "Okay." He said, "I can. I'd
[1:46:07] like to. Where do you live?" He said,
[1:46:08] "Well, you go up over this mountain
[1:46:10] here." I said, "How you going to get
[1:46:11] there? You don't see your house." He
[1:46:13] said, "Yeah, well, there's a path that
[1:46:15] runs up over the hill." I said, "You
[1:46:18] don't see the path." He said, "Well, I
[1:46:20] got a message. I got a lantern." I said
[1:46:23] the lantern won't show the light right
[1:46:25] on the house. Oh no. But the path will
[1:46:28] lead to the house. Come on, church.
[1:46:30] Amen. I cannot physically right now see
[1:46:33] my theophony, but I know it's right
[1:46:35] here. I know around the next bend in the
[1:46:37] road, I've got a theophony waiting for
[1:46:39] me. I cannot physically see it. Oh,
[1:46:42] church. But I've got a message and it's
[1:46:44] light in the path. It's going to lead me
[1:46:46] to my theophony. And there ain't enough
[1:46:48] devils in hell to defeat me in this
[1:46:50] walk. I'm going to walk like Enoch. I'm
[1:46:53] going to walk like Enoch. And one of
[1:46:55] these mornings, our bodies are going to
[1:46:56] be changed. Hallelujah. Amen. I can't
[1:46:59] see it, but I know it's there. Brother
[1:47:01] Sean, I can't see it, but I know it's
[1:47:04] there. He said, "Yes, sir." Amen. And
[1:47:06] the lantern, now listen, the lantern
[1:47:09] will only show light for one step at a
[1:47:12] time.
[1:47:14] Come on, church. Quit letting the devil
[1:47:16] sit you down because you're not taking
[1:47:18] steps like somebody else. Quit letting
[1:47:20] the devil back you in a corner and say
[1:47:22] you're not making progression because
[1:47:24] you're not walking like this one or
[1:47:26] walking like that one. Hey, if all you
[1:47:28] do is take a centimeter of a step today
[1:47:30] and a centimeter of a step tomorrow,
[1:47:33] you're making progress. Amen. Can I
[1:47:35] preach to you? Amen. One day you're
[1:47:37] going to make a footstep. One day you're
[1:47:39] going to make an inch step. One day
[1:47:40] you're going to make a centimeter step.
[1:47:42] One day it's going to be a mile of a
[1:47:44] step. But whatever you do, just keep
[1:47:46] walking because before long, you're
[1:47:49] going to walk right out of this old pest
[1:47:51] house into the father's house from
[1:47:56] Glory to God. You say, "Preacher, I
[1:47:58] don't know if I can get there." One step
[1:48:00] at a time, sweet Jesus, we'll walk in
[1:48:02] the lines, the beautiful lines. Amen.
[1:48:05] One step at a time, coming closer to
[1:48:08] him. Listen, how many children of the
[1:48:10] light do I have here this morning?
[1:48:12] Brother said, "They're children of the
[1:48:13] light." Brother Tim, they accept his
[1:48:16] word and they keep walking and they
[1:48:18] watch more unfold. Don't leave it. No
[1:48:21] matter what somebody else says, you stay
[1:48:23] right in that and just keep walking and
[1:48:26] watch it unfold and reveal itself.
[1:48:28] Sister Becky, I remember when the Holy
[1:48:30] Ghost got a hold of you. I remember when
[1:48:32] he called you from the denominational
[1:48:34] walk into a believer's walk. I guarantee
[1:48:37] you, Sister Becky, what you believe
[1:48:38] today, you didn't know when God revealed
[1:48:40] this message to you. But why are you
[1:48:42] still here this morning? Because you've
[1:48:44] been taking one step at a time, one tape
[1:48:47] at a time, one service at a time, one
[1:48:50] prayer meeting at a time. Oh, Faith
[1:48:52] Tabernacle, put on your walking shoes.
[1:48:54] We are closer to home than we've ever
[1:48:57] been before. If you'll just keep on
[1:48:59] walking one of these days, we're going
[1:49:01] to step out of this world into the
[1:49:03] heavens of God. Hallelujah. I'm not a
[1:49:06] crazy man. I'm going to keep on watching
[1:49:08] it, and I'm going to watch it unfold.
[1:49:10] Brother Kevin, I'm going to watch a new
[1:49:12] body unfold right before my eyes. I'm
[1:49:15] going to watch my loved ones raised
[1:49:17] incorruptible right before my eyes.
[1:49:21] Because we're walking in the revelation
[1:49:24] which is the light. Can I ask you
[1:49:26] something? Why are you still here?
[1:49:30] Why are you still here after everything
[1:49:32] you've been through? After every blow,
[1:49:35] after everything the devil's tried to do
[1:49:37] to destroy you, why are you still here?
[1:49:39] Because this light is an anchor.
[1:49:43] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Brother will. This light is an
[1:49:46] anchor. Brother M said it's walking into
[1:49:49] a light that you never witnessed before.
[1:49:51] It's an anchor of a divine faith that
[1:49:54] cause anything. Contrary, brother Sean,
[1:49:57] to the word of God as though it wasn't.
[1:50:01] He said, see, I love how he says this.
[1:50:04] He said, it puts new life. Brother Tim,
[1:50:07] I want to say this to this morning,
[1:50:08] church. It is the light. I'm going to
[1:50:12] read you some things, okay? But when I
[1:50:14] say it, just keep this in mind. The
[1:50:16] light, okay? It puts new life. It gives
[1:50:20] hope to the dying. It gives courage to
[1:50:22] the weak. It gives healing to the sick.
[1:50:25] It gives blessings to the unfavored. How
[1:50:29] wonderful it is. Amen. To step into the
[1:50:32] light of his presence. It's not a myth.
[1:50:35] And neither is it something that
[1:50:37] somebody has just fleshly in their minds
[1:50:40] drawn up. But it's coming directly into
[1:50:43] the presence of the king of glory, which
[1:50:45] is the eternal light of the living God.
[1:50:48] You say, "Preacher, how am I supposed to
[1:50:50] walk?" We got to walk like Jesus. We got
[1:50:52] to walk like Jesus. You say, "How did
[1:50:55] Jesus walk?" His walk was a walk to
[1:50:57] fulfill the word. Every step he took,
[1:51:00] Brother Sean, he said, "I'm fulfilling
[1:51:02] the word." On days he felt like it, he
[1:51:04] was fulfilling the word. On days he
[1:51:06] didn't feel like it, he was fulfilling
[1:51:08] the word because the footsteps of the
[1:51:10] righteous are ordered of the Lord.
[1:51:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You got to walk unconscious
[1:51:16] of fear. Come on, church. You got to
[1:51:18] walk unconscious of criticism. You got
[1:51:20] to walk unconscious of the world. You
[1:51:22] got to walk as you walk in Christ. If
[1:51:25] something comes up in the church, walk
[1:51:27] with God. If sickness strikes you, walk
[1:51:30] with God. If the neighbor don't like
[1:51:31] you, walk with God. Walk with God. If
[1:51:35] the doctor says you're going to die,
[1:51:37] walk with God. If the doctor says you
[1:51:39] can't get well, walk with God. Just walk
[1:51:41] with God. Go on, brother. For God has
[1:51:45] promised, "I'll never leave you. I'll
[1:51:47] never forsake you. I'll be with you
[1:51:49] until the end of the world." Well, did
[1:51:51] you hear that, devil? I'm not going to
[1:51:53] sit down. I'm going to keep on walking
[1:51:55] with God because greater is he that is
[1:51:58] in me than he that is in the world. Oh,
[1:52:01] you'll have your ups and downs. Don't
[1:52:03] worry. You'll go through your brier
[1:52:05] patches. You'll go over your sharp
[1:52:07] rocks. You'll go over bluffs. You'll go
[1:52:09] down on the hillside. You'll go up
[1:52:11] through mountains, over waters. But walk
[1:52:13] with God.
[1:52:16] Hallelujah. Walk with God. Somebody
[1:52:20] shout with me, "Walk with God."
[1:52:22] Look at your neighbor and say, "Walk
[1:52:23] with God." Turn around and look at
[1:52:25] somebody and say, "Walk with God."
[1:52:27] Brother Sean, we're going to walk with
[1:52:29] God. Sister Becky, we're going to walk
[1:52:31] with God. Brother Daniel, we're going to
[1:52:33] walk with God. Brother Josiah, come hell
[1:52:35] or high water, we're going to walk with
[1:52:37] God. Because we're not here to fulfill
[1:52:39] our only desire. We're here to fulfill
[1:52:42] one thing, and that is the word that has
[1:52:44] been revealed concerning our lives.
[1:52:47] That's right.
[1:52:48] &gt;&gt; Walk with God. You say, "Preacher, it's
[1:52:51] hard." Well, can I tell you this? Amen.
[1:52:53] You're You're walking in a mystic light.
[1:52:55] It's a mystic light. You You You got un
[1:52:57] You got Oh, God. You got Brother Brother
[1:53:00] Tim, you got unusual habits. Amen. You
[1:53:03] got You got unusual features. Sister
[1:53:05] Martha's got unusual distinctive
[1:53:07] features. Amen. Go through what they've
[1:53:09] been through this week and they have a
[1:53:11] desire to be in the house of God. Come
[1:53:12] on, church. Amen. She could have laid
[1:53:14] there, but she got up and said, "I'm
[1:53:16] going to try to make it the house of
[1:53:17] God." Listen, I want to say this,
[1:53:19] though. She did make it here. The devil
[1:53:21] still didn't win because walking with
[1:53:23] God means walking in his word and
[1:53:25] believing he's greater than whatever
[1:53:27] we're going through. You say, "You lost
[1:53:29] your mind." Amen. I know I know a sister
[1:53:31] Crystal could be here. She would be here
[1:53:33] this morning. Amen. If Sister Alice
[1:53:35] could be here, she would be here this
[1:53:37] morning. But I want to tell you sisters,
[1:53:39] I want to tell you, brothers, just
[1:53:40] because you might not be able to make it
[1:53:42] physically, it don't mean you're
[1:53:44] defeated. Just keep on walking with God.
[1:53:46] And one of these days, you're going to
[1:53:48] walk out of that situation. Well, I
[1:53:50] knocked the water over. Here we go. Walk
[1:53:53] with God. Are you hearing me? Walk with
[1:53:55] God. You say, "Preacher, I don't feel
[1:53:57] like it." He said, "Don't worry about
[1:53:59] that. Just walk with God." You say, "Why
[1:54:01] have I got to keep on walking?" Because
[1:54:03] we're so close. We're so close. You
[1:54:06] don't know that your next step could not
[1:54:08] be the change of your body.
[1:54:11] You say, "Preacher, you lost your mind."
[1:54:13] I hadn't lost my mind. Brother said,
[1:54:15] "Now it's time to walk a straight line."
[1:54:18] Right now, brother, sister, it's time to
[1:54:20] walk a straight line. If there's ever
[1:54:22] been a time to walk a straight line, now
[1:54:24] is the time to walk it. If there's ever
[1:54:26] been a time to get more dedicated and
[1:54:28] say, "Lord, what do you require of me?"
[1:54:30] Now is the time to do it. We're on the
[1:54:34] walk to glory.
[1:54:37] &gt;&gt; We're We're And I'll say this as plain
[1:54:39] as I know how. Amen. We're not on the
[1:54:41] death march.
[1:54:42] &gt;&gt; That's right. We're not on the death
[1:54:44] march. We're on the walk to glory. We're
[1:54:47] going to walk out of here, folks. Reb
[1:54:50] said, "Listen." He said, "Oh my." He
[1:54:52] said, "Now you're coming into perfect
[1:54:53] faith." He said, "Look, you're coming in
[1:54:55] perfect faith, which is perfect
[1:54:57] perfection that cannot fail." He says,
[1:54:59] "That's faith never fails." Yes. Jesus
[1:55:03] Christ, he was a mystic to them with
[1:55:06] this perfect faith. And so it is now
[1:55:09] with those who have perfect faith. They
[1:55:12] are a mystic to others.
[1:55:15] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Come on, church. You're a
[1:55:18] mystic to the world.
[1:55:21] &gt;&gt; But it's not because of what you done.
[1:55:24] &gt;&gt; It's because of the light you're walking
[1:55:27] in. Now, look what Paul said. He said,
[1:55:30] "When I was a child, I spake as a
[1:55:32] child." He said, "As you grow older,
[1:55:34] then you begin from making your first
[1:55:35] couple steps and toddle and fall and get
[1:55:38] up and try it again." He said, "Then
[1:55:40] after a while, you get so on the God
[1:55:43] bless you, buddy. First time I've ever
[1:55:45] had to have a janitor in the middle of
[1:55:46] service.
[1:55:49] Now,
[1:55:51] I know I've kicked over violins and now
[1:55:53] cups.
[1:55:55] Now, it's time to walk a straight line.
[1:55:58] See? Right on down that highway to
[1:56:00] glory. Look here. I want I want to I
[1:56:03] want to just I just want I want to drop
[1:56:04] some things to you if that's okay. Don't
[1:56:06] give up. Just keep walking." You see, I
[1:56:09] I I'll share this with you. Amen. This
[1:56:11] has been on I'm sorry, but it's just
[1:56:13] it's it's been real to my heart since
[1:56:14] the New Year. So, I it's on my heart
[1:56:16] this morning. Okay. I'm just going to
[1:56:18] share it with you. This this past past
[1:56:20] December, I was flying up from Florida
[1:56:22] over to brother Brother Brother Way
[1:56:23] Dells and I was going up there to to
[1:56:25] preach a uh a watch night service. And I
[1:56:28] was on the plane flying up there and I'm
[1:56:30] I'm just reading along and studying
[1:56:32] through the message and and I just
[1:56:33] started praying. And I said, 'Lord, I
[1:56:35] said, 'Brother Brandon would preach New
[1:56:37] Year sermons. I said, 'Lord, if you
[1:56:39] would, if you would have something for
[1:56:41] me, a New Year sermon, what would be
[1:56:42] mine? Would you would you just give it
[1:56:44] to me? And as clear as I'm talking to
[1:56:46] you, it wasn't an audible voice. It was
[1:56:47] just something Brother Mark so
[1:56:49] distinctly spoke in my heart and said
[1:56:51] these words, "Go tell my people just
[1:56:55] keep walking."
[1:56:58] &gt;&gt; And I said, Lord, that now I just got to
[1:57:02] be honest because I'm human. I said,
[1:57:04] 'Lord, people's heard that over and over
[1:57:07] and over. That's not going what I just
[1:57:11] be honest. I started arguing with the
[1:57:12] Lord. I said, 'Lord, I said, how's that
[1:57:14] going? And it's just as clear as day,
[1:57:16] just something come over my heart and
[1:57:18] spoke again. Said, go tell my people
[1:57:21] just keep walking.
[1:57:25] I said, Lord, if you give me something,
[1:57:27] I know I'm going to find it in this
[1:57:28] message.
[1:57:29] Got in the message. Brother said this.
[1:57:31] He said, "In this great faith battle, as
[1:57:34] I've tried to fight it, I've seen some
[1:57:36] awful obstacles, been over some rough
[1:57:38] roads. It shows me I have. But it's been
[1:57:40] the most blessed thing. I wouldn't trade
[1:57:42] it for nothing in the world. And here's
[1:57:45] my greatest victories, the greatest
[1:57:47] pleasures I have is when I come up
[1:57:49] against something and I can't see over,
[1:57:52] around it, or under it. I just keep
[1:57:55] walking towards it, believing this that
[1:57:58] God will make a way when I get there.
[1:58:01] Can I give you another one? He said,
[1:58:03] "Just keep walking. Don't stand still.
[1:58:05] You'll never get nowhere. If you've been
[1:58:08] saved, then walk to sanctification." You
[1:58:10] say, "How do I get there?" Just keep
[1:58:12] walking. Is the baptism of the Holy
[1:58:14] Ghost after sanctification? How do I get
[1:58:16] that? Just keep walking in the light. Is
[1:58:19] signs, wonders, and miracles. Just keep
[1:58:21] walking in the light. See, just keep on
[1:58:23] listen. And every time you make a step,
[1:58:26] the light will jump just a little ahead
[1:58:28] of you. Cuz he's always ahead of you. He
[1:58:31] don't push, he leads. He is the light.
[1:58:35] Can I say something to you this morning?
[1:58:37] God will do the leading if we'll do the
[1:58:40] walking.
[1:58:42] &gt;&gt; If we'll do the walking, God will do the
[1:58:46] leading. Brother Bam says, look in
[1:58:47] Ephesians 5. For ye were sometimes
[1:58:49] darkness. Can I have just a few more
[1:58:51] minutes? For ye were sometimes darkness,
[1:58:54] but now look what he says. But now are
[1:58:56] ye light in the Lord.
[1:59:00] &gt;&gt; Look, I don't believe he's just talking
[1:59:02] about weight, folks. I believe he's
[1:59:04] talking about about illumination, about
[1:59:06] brilliance, about about vision, about
[1:59:07] light. Now ye are light in the Lord. So
[1:59:11] walk as children of the light. He said,
[1:59:15] "Just keep walking till after a while,
[1:59:17] you'll get so light, you'll just walk on
[1:59:20] up in the rapture."
[1:59:23] Woo! Glory. If you'll just keep walking,
[1:59:26] you'll become so light. You'll become so
[1:59:28] much light that you'll just walk on up
[1:59:30] in the rapture. Now, as I was as I was
[1:59:33] studying and just fellowship with the
[1:59:34] Lord on this, I asked him, I said,
[1:59:36] "Lord," I was just praying. I said,
[1:59:38] "Lord, here I'm finding these quotes." I
[1:59:40] said, "Now, there's got to be a power.
[1:59:42] There's got to be a power in walking."
[1:59:43] And brother Sean, I know Morren said
[1:59:45] that as I was just praying and I found
[1:59:47] this quote as I was listening to the
[1:59:48] tapes. Brother said this. He said, "No
[1:59:50] matter how it looks, just keep on
[1:59:52] anyhow. No matter how it looks, just
[1:59:55] keep on anyhow." If God said do it, just
[1:59:59] keep on anyhow. That's the way you do
[2:00:01] it. Now, here's what got me. He said,
[2:00:04] "That's the way you get well." See, is
[2:00:07] just keep on walking. You say, "Well,
[2:00:11] yesterday I couldn't wiggle my finger
[2:00:13] but that much, but today I can wiggle it
[2:00:15] that much." Amen. Tomorrow I'll wiggle
[2:00:17] it that much. He said, "Just keep on
[2:00:21] walking." He said, "Look what the fine
[2:00:23] doctor said a while ago." He comes to
[2:00:25] the end of his role. Then he trusts God.
[2:00:28] There you are. That's it. Science is all
[2:00:30] right. As long as you're climbing on the
[2:00:32] tree, when you get up as far as you can
[2:00:34] go and you can't get no further, he
[2:00:37] said, "Step over on the tree of faith
[2:00:40] and just keep on walking because it has
[2:00:44] no end to it." Hallelujah. If you're
[2:00:47] walking on signs, you're going to walk
[2:00:49] to an end. But if you're walking on the
[2:00:51] tree of faith, which is coming from the
[2:00:53] tree of life, you're going to walk into
[2:00:55] the paradise of God.
[2:00:58] &gt;&gt; What are you saying, brother Andrew?
[2:00:59] saying this, "Keep on walking. Keep on
[2:01:02] walking." I got to studying this and I
[2:01:04] found out over and over, Brother Bram
[2:01:05] uses that phrase over and over and over
[2:01:07] and over and over and over and over on
[2:01:09] prayer lines. And you know what he'll
[2:01:10] say? He'll say these words. He'll say,
[2:01:13] "You're healed.
[2:01:16] Now, just keep on walking."
[2:01:19] He'll say, "You want to get well? Just
[2:01:21] keep on walking." He'll say, "Come now,
[2:01:23] lady. You believe God makes you well?
[2:01:25] Well, then just go walking." I said,
[2:01:28] "Dear Lord, what they're doing, listen,
[2:01:30] can I can I can I can I close on this?
[2:01:32] They're walking from one condition to
[2:01:34] another, but they had to keep walking or
[2:01:38] they would have stayed in the condition
[2:01:39] they was in." Oh, church, are you
[2:01:41] hearing me this morning? It's time to
[2:01:43] put our walking shoes on. If we just sit
[2:01:46] down, we're never going to taste
[2:01:47] victory. If we just give up, we're never
[2:01:50] going to experience the defeat of the
[2:01:51] enemy. But if we'll this morning by the
[2:01:54] supernatural atonement of God, put on
[2:01:56] our walking shoes. We're going to walk
[2:01:58] from one condition into another
[2:02:00] condition. Can I tell you something,
[2:02:01] Faith Tabernacle? Don't you ever show up
[2:02:03] to church without your walking shoes on.
[2:02:06] Don't you ever show up to a meeting
[2:02:08] without your walking shoes on. You know
[2:02:10] why? Because the shoes you're wearing
[2:02:12] tells what you're fixing to do. Come on.
[2:02:15] If the shoes you're wearing, it tells
[2:02:17] what you're fixing to do. Brother Mark,
[2:02:19] if you was fixing to go out, Amen. and
[2:02:21] feed the cattle, you would have a pair
[2:02:22] of flip-flops on. You'd have a pair of
[2:02:24] boots on because the type of shoes
[2:02:27] you're wearing. If you're fishing to run
[2:02:28] a marathon, you don't have a pair of
[2:02:30] cowboy boots on. You got a pair of
[2:02:32] tennis shoes on because the shoes you're
[2:02:34] wearing tells what you're fixing to do.
[2:02:37] And when you come to the house of God
[2:02:39] and you got your walking shoes on, you
[2:02:41] know you're going to hear the word. You
[2:02:43] know the light is going to shine. You
[2:02:45] know the power of God is going to be
[2:02:46] there. What you're telling that devil
[2:02:48] is, I'm fixing to walk out of
[2:02:49] depression. I'm fixing to walk out of
[2:02:52] anxiety. I'm fixing to walk out of
[2:02:54] nervousness. I'm fixing to walk out of
[2:02:55] this sickness. I've got my walking shoes
[2:02:58] on.
[2:03:01] &gt;&gt; Listen this morning. It's time to walk.
[2:03:03] &gt;&gt; It is.
[2:03:05] &gt;&gt; It's time to walk. It's time to look
[2:03:07] that devil square in the face and say,
[2:03:08] "I will not sit down. I will not lay
[2:03:11] down. I will not back up. I'm going to
[2:03:14] walk." That's right.
[2:03:16] &gt;&gt; You say, "Preacher, it's the darkest
[2:03:17] hour I've ever seen." You say,
[2:03:19] "Preacher, it's the worst hour I've ever
[2:03:21] faced." You say, "Brother Andrew, you
[2:03:22] don't understand. It's the darkest trial
[2:03:25] I've calculated. I've racked my brain.
[2:03:26] I've racked my mind. It's the darkest
[2:03:28] trial I think my faith has ever
[2:03:30] witnessed." Amen. Amen. I'm just
[2:03:32] preaching to you from my heart right
[2:03:33] now. It's the darkest hour I've ever
[2:03:35] seen. Brother Andrew, how can you stand
[2:03:37] there and tell me to keep walking? I've
[2:03:39] got to tell you that because I've got
[2:03:41] the Hebrew boys on record. I've got the
[2:03:44] Hebrew boys on record. Can I tell y'all
[2:03:46] something? I know it's simple, but just
[2:03:48] hear my heart. The Bible says they
[2:03:50] heated that furnace seven times hotter.
[2:03:52] Seven, brother Tim. Seven times hotter
[2:03:54] than it had ever been heated before. But
[2:03:56] you know what I found? I got to studying
[2:03:58] and I found this. When the king
[2:04:00] condemned them and the king the king
[2:04:02] passed judgment and said they'll go in
[2:04:03] the fiery furnace, you know what I found
[2:04:05] out, brother Will? They didn't walk to
[2:04:07] the fiery or they didn't get pushed to
[2:04:08] the fiery furnace. You know what I found
[2:04:10] out? I found out, brother Sean, that the
[2:04:13] guards didn't put something around them
[2:04:14] and drag them up that death walk. Drag
[2:04:16] him up that plank to the to the fiery
[2:04:18] furnace. You know what I found? I found,
[2:04:20] Sister Jame, they walked. They walked.
[2:04:23] Sister Brenda, they walked. Amen. They
[2:04:26] walked right up the death plank to the
[2:04:28] fiery furnace. When they opened the
[2:04:29] door, the heat was so hot it begin to
[2:04:32] kill the guards standing around. You
[2:04:34] know what I found, brother Sean? I
[2:04:35] didn't find the guards had to push him
[2:04:37] off in there. I didn't find the guards.
[2:04:39] Had to push them in there with a with a
[2:04:41] spear. You know what I found? The proto.
[2:04:43] God said, he said, I can see Shadrach,
[2:04:45] Meack, and and Abedneo. I can see them
[2:04:48] take a step off into the fiery furnace.
[2:04:51] You mean they walked to the fiery
[2:04:53] furnace? You mean that nobody pushed
[2:04:55] them in there, Levi? Brother Levi, they
[2:04:57] stepped off in it. You know what else I
[2:04:59] found out? When they got in the fiery
[2:05:01] furnace, they didn't sit down and have a
[2:05:03] pity party and say, "Poor pitiful us."
[2:05:06] Amen. If we wouldn't have believed this
[2:05:07] message, if we wouldn't have stood for
[2:05:09] this word, we wouldn't be in this
[2:05:10] condition. When they got in the middle
[2:05:12] of the fiery furnace, they were bound
[2:05:14] hand and foot. But you know what they
[2:05:16] done? They walked around in the middle
[2:05:19] of the fiery furnace. Can I say
[2:05:21] something to you? There never was a time
[2:05:23] they sat down and quit walking.
[2:05:27] I'm feeling good now. Shadrach looked
[2:05:29] over at Meshack and Abednego looked over
[2:05:31] at Shadrach and they were bound hand and
[2:05:33] foot. They said, "Listen, we can't
[2:05:35] praise like we want to. We can't shout
[2:05:37] like we want to. But as long as we can
[2:05:39] move, we're going to move. As long as we
[2:05:41] can do something, we're going to do it."
[2:05:42] So maybe they just kind of hopped around
[2:05:44] in the fiery furnace. But you know what
[2:05:46] happened? They kept on walking and
[2:05:48] before long, one of them bumped into
[2:05:50] something. They bumped into something
[2:05:52] and Shadrach turned around and said,
[2:05:54] "Oh, look here, boys." Amen. It's one
[2:05:56] who is like unto the son of God. You
[2:05:58] know what he done? He loosed them of the
[2:06:00] bands. He loosed their feet. Oh, church,
[2:06:03] can I show it to you? If you just keep
[2:06:05] on walking, you're going to change
[2:06:07] conditions. If you just keep on walking,
[2:06:09] you're going to change conditions. They
[2:06:11] walked to the fiery furnace. They walked
[2:06:13] into the fiery furnace. They walked
[2:06:15] around in the fiery furnace. Oh, but
[2:06:17] when the fourth man showed up, he
[2:06:19] changed their condition. And here's the
[2:06:21] best part about it, brother. They walked
[2:06:23] right out of the fiery furnace. Because
[2:06:25] if you just keep on walking, things are
[2:06:28] going to change. If you just keep on
[2:06:30] walking, before long the conditions are
[2:06:32] going to change. Listen, I say to you
[2:06:34] this morning, put on your walking shoes.
[2:06:38] &gt;&gt; I say to you this morning, footsteps, it
[2:06:41] means possession. Reverend said, "How
[2:06:43] much can you walk around that
[2:06:44] wheelchair? How much can you walk around
[2:06:46] that cancer? How much can you walk
[2:06:48] around that sin?" Hear my heart this
[2:06:50] morning, devil, we're not defeated.
[2:06:53] We're not defeated. How much can you
[2:06:55] walk around that wheelchair? How much
[2:06:57] can you walk around that cancer? How
[2:06:59] much can you walk around that sin?
[2:07:02] &gt;&gt; Can I read it? Shouting the victory.
[2:07:06] &gt;&gt; That God gives the promise when you can
[2:07:09] see him who is invisible.
[2:07:12] &gt;&gt; And when that pulsation comes into your
[2:07:14] heart and begins to pulsate, I'm the
[2:07:17] Lord who heals all thy diseases.
[2:07:22] &gt;&gt; Can I give you some strength here? When
[2:07:24] you can see that, everything else
[2:07:27] weakens away.
[2:07:30] &gt;&gt; Joshua looked at the unseen and he
[2:07:33] walked around the walls believing it
[2:07:36] would happen. He said, "Now Joshua had a
[2:07:39] V-Day at the river, too, at the at the
[2:07:41] He had a V-Day at Jericho. He said,
[2:07:43] "God, let disappointments happen to show
[2:07:45] victory. You'd only see those things
[2:07:47] that seems to be so burning you and
[2:07:48] upsetting you. They're trials. They are
[2:07:50] things, but stand still. Focus your
[2:07:53] glasses on the word of God. Speak the
[2:07:55] Now, now you say, "Preacher, you just
[2:07:57] spent an hour telling us to walk." And
[2:08:01] then you just said, "Stand still.
[2:08:06] Stand still. Focus your glasses on the
[2:08:08] word of God. Speak the word." And then
[2:08:10] just walk forward.
[2:08:13] &gt;&gt; See, speak the word. Lord, I believe.
[2:08:14] And just start walking forward. God
[2:08:17] opens the Red Sea.
[2:08:20] &gt;&gt; Can I tell you how we're going to walk
[2:08:21] forward? You that's going through
[2:08:23] situations and trials, sicknesses in
[2:08:25] your body, walk forward with undying
[2:08:28] faith.
[2:08:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:08:30] &gt;&gt; Prophet of God said goes beyond the
[2:08:32] physical. See, it goes into the
[2:08:34] spiritual realm and picks up the
[2:08:35] thoughts of the heart and reveals them.
[2:08:36] The spirit of God, the word of God. Now,
[2:08:39] I know I know I'm going long, but just
[2:08:40] give me a minute here. Now, that word
[2:08:42] will cut in there if there's enough arm
[2:08:45] behind it to push it in. It'll find its
[2:08:48] place and cut every promise out and give
[2:08:51] it to you if you just got the strong
[2:08:54] enough arm behind it. See the sword?
[2:08:58] Pick it up in an arm of faith. I'm
[2:09:00] giving you instructions now. Pick it up
[2:09:02] in an arm of faith. Grip it. Y'all want
[2:09:06] to practice this morning? Pick it up.
[2:09:10] &gt;&gt; Pick it up in an arm of faith.
[2:09:12] &gt;&gt; Pick it up in an arm of faith and grip
[2:09:14] it tight. Yeah.
[2:09:16] &gt;&gt; Hold on to it and walk into the face of
[2:09:19] the enemy.
[2:09:22] &gt;&gt; How can that uncircumcised enemy ever
[2:09:24] stand there in the presence of the
[2:09:25] eternal God? So you take the sword of
[2:09:27] the word and every promise belongs to
[2:09:30] you. You pick it up in a strong hand of
[2:09:33] faith. Walk forward. If you need
[2:09:35] healing, cut it out with the word. Jesus
[2:09:38] Christ the same yesterday, today, and
[2:09:41] forever. If you need salvation, every
[2:09:43] promise in the Bible is yours. It's
[2:09:46] laying back in there, and Satan's trying
[2:09:49] to hide it. But take the sword and push
[2:09:52] through the darkness until the light of
[2:09:54] God shines upon your soul, and you have
[2:09:58] the promise.
[2:10:01] &gt;&gt; You say, "Preacher, you're getting out
[2:10:02] there." Well, I say this. Light has
[2:10:04] come. Amen. Amen. I got to I got to give
[2:10:06] this to you. Light has come. Re said,
[2:10:08] "When light comes," he said, "the
[2:10:09] forcing hour has come." When light
[2:10:11] comes, the forcing hour has come. He
[2:10:14] said, "Now is time." Amen. To rise and
[2:10:17] trim your lamp and shine with the gospel
[2:10:21] of Jesus Christ. Faith tabernacle, now
[2:10:24] is the time, believers, now is the time
[2:10:28] to arise and trim your lamp. He said,
[2:10:30] "See, God has a way of forcing the issue
[2:10:33] sometime." He said, "See, look here. The
[2:10:36] force of this light," now, now I want
[2:10:37] you to catch this. The force of this
[2:10:39] light is going to force the believer
[2:10:42] from a pest house to his father's house.
[2:10:45] From a tabernacle of humiliation to a
[2:10:48] tabernacle of glorification. From
[2:10:50] corruption to incorruption. From mortal
[2:10:53] to immortality. When light comes, you've
[2:10:56] got to work against the light.
[2:11:00] &gt;&gt; To stay in darkness.
[2:11:03] &gt;&gt; Can I say this to you? When light comes,
[2:11:06] time to get up. Amen.
[2:11:09] &gt;&gt; When light comes, it's time to get up.
[2:11:13] Do you know when the light rises, when
[2:11:15] the sun rises in the morning, it's a
[2:11:16] natural instinct to get up? You know,
[2:11:19] they got room darkening shades. You know
[2:11:21] what they hang those up for? To keep the
[2:11:24] light out so you don't get this the
[2:11:25] light don't get your attention and shake
[2:11:28] you out of that sleep.
[2:11:31] &gt;&gt; Folks, that's the same way it is in the
[2:11:33] spiritual. The devil's taken room
[2:11:35] darkening curtains and put them around
[2:11:36] the promises of God. And you're laying
[2:11:38] there and the devil's trying to whisper
[2:11:39] to you and tell you this. What he's
[2:11:41] trying to do is he's trying to keep the
[2:11:43] light from striking the word and
[2:11:44] energizing your soul to believe it.
[2:11:46] Because the prophet of God said any
[2:11:48] devil is afraid of light. Any creeping
[2:11:51] evil thing is afraid of light. But can I
[2:11:53] can I give you the word this morning?
[2:11:55] Can I give you this? It's Isaiah 60 and
[2:11:57] verse one. Arise.
[2:11:59] Arise and shine for thy light is come
[2:12:03] and the glory of the Lord is risen upon
[2:12:06] thee. Look at this word arise. It means
[2:12:08] to stand up. It means to arise in a
[2:12:11] hostile sense. It means to become
[2:12:13] powerful. It means to be established. It
[2:12:16] means to be confirmed. It means to
[2:12:18] endure, to stand, to be fixed, to be
[2:12:19] valid. It means to give effect to. Oh,
[2:12:23] when the light comes, it's time to arise
[2:12:26] and become powerful over that sin.
[2:12:28] Become powerful over that sickness.
[2:12:30] Become powerful over that spirit.
[2:12:32] Listen. Let God arise and his enemies be
[2:12:35] scattered. Won't you stand to your feet
[2:12:37] this morning?
[2:12:39] Let God arise. Let his enemies be
[2:12:42] scattered. Let them also that hate him
[2:12:45] flee before him. As smoke is driven
[2:12:48] away, so drive them away. As wax meltth
[2:12:52] before the fire, I'm in Psalm 68:2. As
[2:12:55] wax meltth before the fire, so let the
[2:12:58] wicked perish at the presence of God.
[2:13:03] Can I finish verse three? But let the
[2:13:06] righteous be glad.
[2:13:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:13:08] &gt;&gt; Let them rejoice before God. Yay, let
[2:13:13] them exceedingly
[2:13:15] rejoice, folks.
[2:13:17] &gt;&gt; Let them rejoice before God. Let them
[2:13:23] exceedingly rejoice.
[2:13:26] See, you are the light of the world. You
[2:13:29] believe that tonight?
[2:13:31] &gt;&gt; You are the light of the world. And I'm
[2:13:32] sorry I keep saying tonight. You believe
[2:13:34] that this morning. And when you receive
[2:13:37] the Holy Ghost, how many's got the Holy
[2:13:39] Ghost? When you receive the Holy Ghost,
[2:13:42] now here's what the devil hates.
[2:13:45] You're sealed till the journey is over.
[2:13:48] That is your token that you hold that
[2:13:53] shows your fair has been paid. You are a
[2:13:55] redeemed character. Satan has no
[2:13:58] business with you. None whatever. Just
[2:14:01] pick up your token and show him my
[2:14:05] healing is paid for.
[2:14:07] [Music]
[2:14:09] My trip to glory is paid for. Rebraham
[2:14:13] said just pick up your token and show
[2:14:14] him. Can I say this? pick up your token
[2:14:17] and force him.
[2:14:19] You know, the token forces things.
[2:14:22] Reb said, "Excuse me, friends, if I
[2:14:24] yelled out loud, I I wasn't yelling at
[2:14:26] you, but demons sometimes has to be
[2:14:29] forced. See, they don't want to move."
[2:14:32] He said, "See, the devil is a great
[2:14:33] force. The devil has a great power, and
[2:14:36] the devil is great in his power."
[2:14:39] Can I humiliate him? But he's under the
[2:14:42] power of God.
[2:14:45] Glory. He has a great power. He's great
[2:14:48] in his power, but he's under the power
[2:14:51] of God. And the devil can only be at one
[2:14:54] place at one time. His imps can be
[2:14:56] anywhere scattered out. His demons, his
[2:14:58] co-workers, but God himself alone is in
[2:15:01] the field of omnipresent. Not an angel,
[2:15:03] but God himself. Then that gives us
[2:15:05] courage. Wherever two or three are
[2:15:07] gathered together, I'll be in their
[2:15:09] midst. Now, Satan, you foul devil, you
[2:15:13] are defeated.
[2:15:15] God said he would restore the son of
[2:15:17] God, and we here to lay claim. We're
[2:15:20] here and we hear him lay to your claim.
[2:15:23] He promised to restore the church to its
[2:15:25] former condition when the evening light
[2:15:28] shine and we're living in it. And by
[2:15:30] restoring, we have a right. We have our
[2:15:33] attorney. We have our lawyer, our high
[2:15:36] priest, and we're going to force the
[2:15:38] claim. You've had him long enough. You
[2:15:42] can't do it any longer. We charge thee
[2:15:44] in the name of Jesus Christ by the power
[2:15:47] of his resurrection and the Holy Ghost.
[2:15:50] How many feels the strength of God right
[2:15:52] now? How many feels the strength of God
[2:15:55] coming to your confession? How many
[2:15:57] feels the strength of God right now?
[2:15:59] Amen. Those of you listening at home,
[2:16:01] receive ye the strength of the word of
[2:16:03] God right now. It's not a man, it's the
[2:16:06] word. He said there's his word and his
[2:16:08] blood is to take care of it. Everything
[2:16:11] he put in the atonement is ours. We have
[2:16:13] it by faith. So just accept it and walk
[2:16:16] forward and confess it and watch what
[2:16:20] takes place.
[2:16:21] [Music]
[2:16:23] Accept it this morning. confess it and
[2:16:27] just start walking forward and you'll
[2:16:30] see the power of God move.
[2:16:34] You'll see the power of the Holy Spirit.
[2:16:37] Listen, I've seen it before. I've seen
[2:16:39] it. You've seen it. May we live such a
[2:16:43] holy consecrated life after this.
[2:16:45] Brother says that men will see the
[2:16:47] reflection of Jesus Christ in us and
[2:16:50] that our walk in life would be worthy of
[2:16:54] the gospel that we believe. Brother
[2:16:58] Sean, I got to take his word, hold it
[2:17:02] out there, accept it, confess it.
[2:17:06] You say, "Brother Andrew, I don't know
[2:17:08] if it works." It works.
[2:17:10] It works. I want to thank you all for I
[2:17:13] know you all were praying for us when
[2:17:15] brother Josh Martin and I was there in
[2:17:16] Czech Republic. I want to thank you all
[2:17:18] for your prayers just this morning get
[2:17:20] ready for church. I've been been
[2:17:22] battling my mind a little bit about
[2:17:23] something. I taken a service there on
[2:17:25] Friday night and it just come up heavy
[2:17:26] on my heart brother Sean just to preach
[2:17:28] on the authority of accepting the word
[2:17:30] of God. Not trying to make something
[2:17:32] happen, pray something down, pull
[2:17:33] something out of the altar. Just accept
[2:17:35] the finished work of Calvary. The devil
[2:17:37] been bombarding my mind. Well, some will
[2:17:39] misunderstand you and some didn't get
[2:17:40] it. But just this morning getting ready
[2:17:42] for church, I got a text from brother
[2:17:43] brother Gregory there in Czech Republic.
[2:17:45] He said, "But Andrew, here's a testimony
[2:17:46] for you." He said, "Friday night while
[2:17:48] you were preaching on accepting the
[2:17:49] word." He said, "There was a young man
[2:17:51] sitting there got delivered of gambling
[2:17:52] and is getting baptized in his home
[2:17:54] church today."
[2:17:57] Come on, folks. We're not just
[2:18:00] preachers.
[2:18:01] You're not just church members. You're
[2:18:04] light in the Lord. I got a whole sermon
[2:18:07] on it. I'll just tell it to you like
[2:18:08] this. And life forces things to happen.
[2:18:13] That's why when you walk in rooms,
[2:18:14] atmospheres change.
[2:18:17] Come on, folks. That's why when you walk
[2:18:19] in certain places, the whole atmosphere
[2:18:22] changes in there. You know why? Because
[2:18:23] you're light in the Lord.
[2:18:26] And light's forcing conditions.
[2:18:29] Now, here's the thing about it. Darkness
[2:18:32] has to cope with light. But light don't
[2:18:34] have to cope with darkness. Folks, this
[2:18:37] morning I tell you, you're a peculiar
[2:18:39] people. Sister Jane, we're an odd
[2:18:42] people, but we're walking in the
[2:18:46] peculiarity
[2:18:48] of the light. Won't you bow your heart
[2:18:50] with us this morning?
[2:18:54] How many this morning say, "Lord, I want
[2:18:55] to put my walking shoes on.
[2:18:59] Lord, I want to put my walking shoes
[2:19:01] on." Father, take the lantern of your
[2:19:04] word this morning.
[2:19:07] Put it out in front of me, dear God.
[2:19:09] Father, there's things I don't
[2:19:11] understand. There's situations I'm going
[2:19:14] through. There's battles I'm battling in
[2:19:16] my mind and the mind battles and the
[2:19:19] thoughts, Lord. But, Father, I believe
[2:19:21] your word and I believe your word is
[2:19:24] true. And I believe I believe your word
[2:19:27] is superior.
[2:19:30] I believe your word is light this
[2:19:31] morning. Now, Father, as a as a
[2:19:34] believer, Lord, I don't want to walk in
[2:19:36] darkness,
[2:19:39] Lord. I don't want to walk in my own
[2:19:41] ideas.
[2:19:43] Lord, I want to walk in your word.
[2:19:46] If that's your desire this morning,
[2:19:48] won't you just join in prayer with us
[2:19:50] today? You just say, "Lord, consecrate
[2:19:52] me, Lord. Father, I want more of your
[2:19:55] word to unfold to my life. Lord, there's
[2:19:58] things right now I can't see. Lord,
[2:20:01] there's things I believe right now that
[2:20:02] I can't physically see, but Lord, I know
[2:20:05] if I'll just keep on walking, I'll walk
[2:20:08] right into the manifestation of it,
[2:20:10] Lord. Father, I can't I can't see my
[2:20:13] theophony physically. I've heard from
[2:20:16] it. I can't see it physically, Lord, but
[2:20:19] I know if I just keep walking, I'll go
[2:20:21] around the next bend in the road and
[2:20:24] it'll be there for me.
[2:20:26] Maybe you're maybe you're sick in your
[2:20:28] body this morning. You say, "Brother
[2:20:30] Andrew, I can't I can't physically see
[2:20:32] good days again. I don't know how I'll
[2:20:35] ever have them again." But I'm charging
[2:20:37] you this morning in the name of the
[2:20:39] Lord, by the word of the Lord. Put on
[2:20:41] your walking shoes. You say, "Brother
[2:20:44] Ander, I can't make a big step today."
[2:20:46] Well, go ahead and just make a little
[2:20:47] step and tomorrow make another one. And
[2:20:50] the next one day, make another one. And
[2:20:53] next week, make another one. I'm telling
[2:20:55] you the word of the Lord. Brother Bam
[2:20:56] said you're going to walk out of it. He
[2:20:58] said it's the only way you can get well
[2:21:01] is you got to keep walking.
[2:21:03] Almighty God, all across this building
[2:21:06] this morning, Lord, is faithful
[2:21:07] warriors.
[2:21:09] Father, is faithful believers, dear God.
[2:21:12] Lord, they're not here just to fill up
[2:21:14] space on a pew. Lord, they're not here
[2:21:17] just to take up time on Sunday mornings
[2:21:19] and Wednesday nights and punch a
[2:21:21] religious clock, Lord, and fulfill a
[2:21:23] religious duty. But Lord, they're here
[2:21:26] because there's something in their soul.
[2:21:28] Lord, there's a predestinated seed, dear
[2:21:30] God, that you placed there from before
[2:21:33] the foundation of the world. Lord, you
[2:21:35] called us and you chose us, Lord.
[2:21:38] Father, you elected us and Lord, you've
[2:21:40] taken this message, this glorious end
[2:21:42] time message that you sent us, Lord,
[2:21:44] revealed it by the pillar of fire and
[2:21:47] Lord has positionally placed us, Lord.
[2:21:49] Father, we've heard the takes. And Lord,
[2:21:52] when we hear them, though some may hear
[2:21:53] him say they're chickens, when we hear
[2:21:55] them, we hear him say we're eagles. So
[2:21:58] Lord, this message has positionally
[2:22:00] placed us, dear God, as eagles. And
[2:22:03] Lord, your prophet said eagles as
[2:22:05] believers, Lord. Now, Father, I love
[2:22:07] what your word says. They that wait upon
[2:22:10] the Lord, he shall renew their strength.
[2:22:14] They shall walk and not get weary. They
[2:22:17] shall run and not faint. Father, I
[2:22:21] believe this morning, Lord, there's some
[2:22:22] hungry hearted eagles right here in this
[2:22:25] building today, Father. Lord, some at
[2:22:27] home, dear God. And Lord, this week,
[2:22:29] it's almost like the devil's just just
[2:22:31] targeted individuals in lives. But Lord,
[2:22:34] we stand here this morning to tell that
[2:22:36] devil, you're defeated, Satan. You're
[2:22:39] defeated upon the authority of God's
[2:22:41] word. Lord, we're not just walking with
[2:22:43] you when things are good. Lord, we're
[2:22:45] not just walking with you when things
[2:22:46] are easy, but Father, we're going to
[2:22:48] walk with you when we don't understand
[2:22:50] the situations because, Lord, we have a
[2:22:52] revelation in our soul that as you are
[2:22:55] the light, we walk in the light. And
[2:22:57] Lord, we're going to walk out of these
[2:22:58] bodies one of these days. Now, Father, I
[2:23:01] pray for every believer here today. I
[2:23:03] pray for those that will hear this
[2:23:04] sermon. Father, I pray that as your word
[2:23:07] has been spoken here today, Father, may
[2:23:09] the strength of God return. May the
[2:23:12] power of God return, Lord. May the may
[2:23:15] the may the may the revelation of the
[2:23:17] word return in the hearts and lives of
[2:23:19] your children. Lord, the devil might
[2:23:21] have tried to take it out, Lord, but may
[2:23:23] it return in such power and such
[2:23:26] authority. Father, I pray for the pastor
[2:23:29] here, pastor, brother Shawn here,
[2:23:31] Brother Daniel, Brother Josiah, Lord,
[2:23:33] Brother Terry, Brother Amos, Lord, these
[2:23:35] men of God, Lord, that stand here and
[2:23:37] preach this word. Lord, the devil's
[2:23:39] doing everything he can to take the the
[2:23:41] joy out of them and take the take the
[2:23:43] faith out of them because he knows,
[2:23:45] Lord, they're not just preaching some
[2:23:46] man's idea. They're preaching the fully
[2:23:49] restored revelation of Jesus Christ. And
[2:23:52] Lord, that devil knows that if people
[2:23:54] will begin to hear that word, then
[2:23:56] they'll begin to force the devil to back
[2:23:58] off of their lives and back off of their
[2:24:00] children, back off of their homes.
[2:24:01] Father, I pray for an a special blessing
[2:24:03] upon the men of God here. Lord, may you
[2:24:06] unfold the revelation of this word,
[2:24:07] their hearts like never before. Father,
[2:24:09] I pray for brother Shawn, Lord. Father,
[2:24:12] as the pastor, Lord, as the as the as
[2:24:14] your prophet said, I believe, as the
[2:24:15] burden bearer, as the as the ox of the
[2:24:17] team, dear God. Father, I pray the power
[2:24:20] of God will renew him and refresh him
[2:24:21] this morning, Lord. Father, as he stands
[2:24:24] as a faithful shepherd, Lord, Father,
[2:24:26] battling demons of of sickness, coming
[2:24:28] after his sheep and and demons of
[2:24:30] discouragement, Lord. Oh, God, I pray
[2:24:32] this morning the light of God would
[2:24:34] refresh him today, Lord. Father, I pray
[2:24:36] the power of God would refresh the
[2:24:38] musicians, Lord. Father, as they play
[2:24:40] the music and drive out evil spirits,
[2:24:43] the devil try to discourage them, Lord,
[2:24:45] this morning, dear God, may you give
[2:24:47] them a refreshing, Lord. Father, Lord,
[2:24:49] if there be one here today, lay member,
[2:24:52] deacon, trustee, whomever it may be,
[2:24:53] Father,
[2:24:55] Sunday school teacher, sound person,
[2:24:57] whoever it is, Lord, Father, we need
[2:25:00] each other. Lord, if we've quit, if
[2:25:02] we've quit walking, may this be the day
[2:25:04] we put our walking shoes back on and
[2:25:07] start walking again.
[2:25:09] walking forward, Lord, with undying
[2:25:12] faith in your word.
[2:25:15] In Jesus name we pray.
[2:25:19] In Jesus name we pray.
[2:25:22] Walk in the light,
[2:25:27] beautiful
[2:25:29] light.
[2:25:33] Oh, that's it this morning. Sing it with
[2:25:35] all your heart.

[2:25:56] this morning. How many wants to walk
[2:25:59] with God?
[2:26:00] How many wants to walk with this word?
[2:26:03] I may say, "Today, I'm going to reach in
[2:26:05] there and get a hold of that sword.
[2:26:08] I'm going to drive it right in the face
[2:26:09] of the enemy, and I'm going to grip the
[2:26:11] promises of God, and I'm going to take
[2:26:14] everything the devil's taken away from
[2:26:15] me." The word will work. The word's
[2:26:19] already worked. Stand up on the faith of
[2:26:22] that word by night.
[2:26:25] Oh, it's Jesus,
[2:26:28] the light of the world. Won't you sing
[2:26:32] it this morning?
[2:26:34] We'll walk in the light. It's such a

[2:26:51] are bright.

[2:32:24] Jesus,
[2:32:26] the light of
[2:32:27] &gt;&gt; of the world.
[2:32:30] It just come on my heart this morning to
[2:32:31] share this with you. Praying there for
[2:32:35] our sister Martha. We was down at
[2:32:37] brother Berser's a few months ago back
[2:32:39] in November. Brother Tom Ber, some of
[2:32:41] you probably know him. His wife just
[2:32:43] went to the hospital one day and just
[2:32:45] went in there some issues in her body
[2:32:47] and found a tumor and all kinds of
[2:32:49] things and really bad report they give
[2:32:51] them just right off the bat, you know.
[2:32:53] And I was up in Canada when I heard it
[2:32:55] and brother Tom and sister Don has done
[2:32:57] so much for the young people through the
[2:32:58] years and just come home and I had
[2:33:00] Mariah pick me up there at the airport
[2:33:02] and we drove over there. I just wanted
[2:33:04] to see brother Tom and sister Don and
[2:33:06] just be with them and just went in there
[2:33:08] and brother Tom said, "Brother Andrew,
[2:33:09] would you mind to speak tonight?" He
[2:33:10] said, "I know probably got something on
[2:33:12] your heart." He said, "We need to hear
[2:33:13] from the Lord." You know, and I just
[2:33:15] went in there and begin to preach. And
[2:33:16] brother brother will I was sitting in
[2:33:18] the back room and brother Tom said to
[2:33:19] brother Andrew, he said, "I got a few
[2:33:20] minutes." And she said, "Before I call
[2:33:22] you out," he said, "I want to tell the
[2:33:23] church something." And he got up and he
[2:33:25] started giving a report on Sister Don
[2:33:27] and different things. And he said these
[2:33:28] words. He said, "Now, he said, now next
[2:33:30] week she's going for that autopsy." And
[2:33:32] he said, "And then we'll get the results
[2:33:34] and they'll come back." And he kept
[2:33:36] talking a few minutes and he stopped. He
[2:33:38] said, "I don't know why I said that." He
[2:33:40] said, "It ain't autopsy." He said, "It's
[2:33:42] biopsy." He said, "Just like that." He
[2:33:44] said, "It's biopsy." And brother, I
[2:33:45] think it was brother Wayade there on the
[2:33:46] platform. He said, "Yeah, it's a
[2:33:47] biopsy." And he said, "Yeah, she go for
[2:33:49] that biopsy." Brother Sean, when he said
[2:33:51] that, something in my heart in that back
[2:33:53] room just spoke and said, "Now, if you
[2:33:55] have an autopsy, you take it of
[2:33:57] something that's dead." And I come out
[2:33:59] there that night and just started
[2:34:00] preaching. And I said, "Brother Tom," I
[2:34:02] said, "I don't think it was an accident.
[2:34:03] You said that, brother. I don't think
[2:34:05] it's I said, I believe that when she
[2:34:07] goes, I believe they'll call it a bopsy,
[2:34:09] but I said, I believe it can be an
[2:34:10] autopsy of that cancer in her body dead.
[2:34:13] That tumor just totally dead." Just the
[2:34:15] other day, he text me. He said, "Brother
[2:34:16] Andrew," he said, "Where they said all
[2:34:18] the spots were, they're completely
[2:34:19] gone." He said, "There's a few still
[2:34:22] there." And he said, "They're after
[2:34:23] them." He said, "She's doing really well
[2:34:25] by the grace of God." Listen, folks,
[2:34:27] what may what what what may sound like a
[2:34:30] slip of the tongue, you know what the
[2:34:32] prophet of God said? He said, "By the
[2:34:34] word in our mouth,
[2:34:36] we confess the promises of God." Listen,
[2:34:39] I believe this morning that same God is
[2:34:40] right here in this building. I believe
[2:34:42] that same God go right by brother Tim
[2:34:44] and sister Martha's house right now. I
[2:34:46] believe it. I believe I don't know about
[2:34:48] you, but I believe God's able to do
[2:34:49] these things. Don't you? I know you
[2:34:51] believe it this morning. Amen. Amen.
[2:34:53] Hold the word of the Lord in the face of
[2:34:55] the enemy. Don't run from him. Walk
[2:34:58] forward in his face and grip the
[2:35:01] promises of God. We love you with the
[2:35:03] love of the Lord. God bless you, brother
[2:35:04] Sean. Thank you for allowing us to speak
[2:35:06] to the church this morning. We sure love
[2:35:08] you all and appreciate you and miss you
[2:35:10] and we pray for you and think of you.
[2:35:12] Amen. It's always good to see you. Amen.
[2:35:14] We're still pressing the battle and one
[2:35:16] of these days we're going to change our
[2:35:18] bodies. Will you remember this? Just
[2:35:21] keep walking.
[2:35:23] Just keep walking. You're going to walk
[2:35:25] out of it. Amen. God bless you this
[2:35:27] morning, Brother Sean.
[2:35:30] &gt;&gt; Walk
[2:35:31] in the light.
[2:35:33] for the beautiful
[2:35:36] life.

[2:35:45] are bright.

[2:36:16] yesterday.

[2:36:21] age.

[2:36:32] Jesus,
[2:36:34] the light of the world.
[2:36:39] Can you lift your hands unto the Lord
[2:36:43] just to thank him?
[2:36:45] Hallelujah. We thank you, Father, that
[2:36:48] we're in your hands.
[2:36:51] Thank you, Lord, that you're answering
[2:36:52] the prayer.
[2:36:55] Father, thank you that you've given us
[2:36:57] the grace, the courage to keep on
[2:37:00] walking.
[2:37:02] Oh, Father, we're walking into every
[2:37:06] promise that you have made. Not looking
[2:37:10] back, not sitting around discouraged or
[2:37:14] dismayed, but walking in the light,
[2:37:18] Lord, as you are in the light. Father,
[2:37:22] we thank you, Lord. We love you and
[2:37:25] thank you ahead of time for what you're
[2:37:28] doing.
[2:37:29] Thank you, Lord, for working miracles.
[2:37:33] Hallelujah. We thank you, Jesus.
[2:37:37] My Amen. Did you enjoy the word this
[2:37:40] morning?
[2:37:42] Amen.
[2:37:43] Walking in the light.
[2:37:46] Amen. That's what we are. We're children
[2:37:48] of the light. And there is no way Satan
[2:37:51] can put that light out. Amen. And I'm
[2:37:55] glad for that. Amen. And uh I liked uh
[2:37:59] you know how brother Andrew put it. them
[2:38:02] Hebrew boys, they looking at that fiery
[2:38:06] furnace, yet they didn't hesitate. They
[2:38:09] didn't back up. They just kept walking.
[2:38:12] Amen. Walking right in it and walking
[2:38:15] right out. Amen. And that's the way we
[2:38:18] are. Amen. Bless the name of the Lord.
[2:38:22] Amen. Well, let's just sing that again.

[2:38:37] walking.
[2:38:40] All you know it may be done. And the
[2:38:44] father
[2:38:47] may be standing up right now to give the
[2:38:51] call
[2:38:53] to end it all.
[2:38:56] Oh, keep on walking.

[2:41:06] [Music]
[2:41:10] dear Lord
[2:41:14] with a prize.
[2:41:18] It's clear before our eyes.
[2:41:23] We find the strength
[2:41:27] to press on
[2:41:30] as they just play softly.
[2:41:33] Amen. God bless each and every one of
[2:41:36] you. Amen. And remember, there's
[2:41:40] no reason to be down, no reason to be
[2:41:43] discouraged.
[2:41:44] Amen. And um we have got the word of
[2:41:49] God.
[2:41:50] We're sons and daughters of God. We do
[2:41:53] have a weapon and that's on the word of
[2:41:55] God. Amen. That's the only way you'll
[2:41:58] defeat him. The devil is by the word of
[2:42:01] God. And um keep one another in our
[2:42:06] prayer. I you know it's kind of like dad
[2:42:09] he was saying you know uh to ask the
[2:42:14] family to keep you know to be praying
[2:42:16] for sister Martha and sister Crystal and
[2:42:19] the different ones and dad says well you
[2:42:22] let them know that we're fulfilling what
[2:42:25] Paul required of us and that is bearing
[2:42:28] one another's burdens
[2:42:31] and and that is so true. We're bearing
[2:42:33] one another's burdens. We're praying.
[2:42:36] We're entering into their suffering and
[2:42:39] we're believing, amen, that God going to
[2:42:42] bring bring them through. Amen. And so,
[2:42:46] um, uh, just remember, Sister Martha got
[2:42:50] a lot of things that she's facing and I
[2:42:53] think she's got a a test. Uh, Tuesday,
[2:42:57] is it still? Is that still on? And so
[2:43:00] they're requiring her to do a um
[2:43:05] um cleansing right today and tomorrow.
[2:43:09] And u you know, Sister Martha said, "I
[2:43:12] just don't know how I'm going to do this
[2:43:14] cuz she is so sore just to touch her."
[2:43:18] Uh you know, when they just touched her
[2:43:20] stomach, uh it was extreme pain. And so,
[2:43:26] um, but she's got to do this and it's
[2:43:29] requiring her to get up and down
[2:43:31] constantly all day today and tomorrow,
[2:43:35] uh, for a, uh, a test that she's got to
[2:43:38] have Tuesday. And so, a lot of things
[2:43:40] that she'll be facing. Uh, but we're
[2:43:44] standing with her. So, just keep her in
[2:43:46] our prayer. And, uh, I, uh, I am looking
[2:43:50] for a testimony of God's healing power.
[2:43:54] And um uh we're just believing that.
[2:43:57] Amen. And so uh keep sister uh Crystal
[2:44:01] and Sister Alice, keep Steve in our
[2:44:05] prayer and u um and just one another.
[2:44:10] Amen. So God bless you. We love you. And
[2:44:14] um um want to keep Brother Andrew,
[2:44:18] Sister Mariah in our prayers
[2:44:21] uh just constantly on the road. And we
[2:44:24] really enjoyed that today and appreciate
[2:44:26] brother Andrew just u uh declaring the
[2:44:29] word of the Lord to us. Amen. And just
[2:44:32] reminding us keep on walking. Amen. So
[2:44:37] uh let's just bow our heads. And also um
[2:44:42] we're going to move the prayer service.
[2:44:45] We're going to start doing our prayer
[2:44:47] services on Tuesday.
[2:44:49] And uh we had done that
[2:44:53] before we had quit uh and stopped for a
[2:44:56] season and we were doing them on Monday
[2:44:59] and then we changed it to Tuesday. It
[2:45:01] seemed to work better for everybody. And
[2:45:04] so uh I'm I'm going to just change that.
[2:45:08] So, Tuesday nights, Tuesday nights at
[2:45:12] 7:00, we'll be having a prayer service
[2:45:16] for those that want to come and pray. I
[2:45:20] believe in prayer. And um uh if you do
[2:45:24] not have a need, remember me cuz I've
[2:45:27] got needs and that'll give you something
[2:45:30] to pray about. Amen. And and I know
[2:45:33] others have needs as well. And so um uh
[2:45:38] so remember that Tuesday night 7:00 will
[2:45:41] be prayer service. If you're not able to
[2:45:44] make it just spend time and uh in prayer
[2:45:48] and um I I know the Lord will bless you
[2:45:52] for that. So um brother Bill, do you
[2:45:55] want to dismiss us in prayer? Amen.
