[35:51] unmovable always abounding in the work
[35:55] of the Lord for as much as say you know
[35:58] that your labor is not in vain in the
[36:02] Lord amen so it says be ye steadfast
[36:06] unmovable
[36:08] always abounding in the work of the Lord
[36:12] amen uh you can have your
[36:16] seats this
[36:18] evening and um I guess that would be my
[36:22] title is be F steadfast abounding in the
[36:25] work of the Lord and I was just uh kind
[36:29] of just thinking today and pondering on
[36:33] what I could say to maybe help us to
[36:37] encourage
[36:38] and um you know there there's so many
[36:42] many things especially if you've been in
[36:46] in the uh
[36:49] Christian
[36:51] uh few years you know you you think you
[36:54] we've heard everything that can be said
[36:58] and uh but yet I I think the words of
[37:01] God are
[37:03] Eternal and uh that uh you know uh it's
[37:09] it's something that can help us no
[37:11] matter how many times we hear
[37:13] something uh and uh but one of the
[37:17] things that the prophet made clear to us
[37:20] is that we all have a work to do every
[37:23] one of us have something to
[37:25] do uh uh in the Lord and he would tell
[37:30] us that each one of us has a Ministry
[37:32] how many believes
[37:34] that one of the things that I think the
[37:36] devil has a a um his
[37:41] his trick is is to just to tell us you
[37:46] know or and to try to convince us that
[37:48] we ain't gotten no place uh and and
[37:51] maybe we're not doing good or maybe
[37:53] we're just wandering around and and and
[37:57] and and our life isn't that important
[38:01] but it is
[38:02] important it seems like life is being
[38:05] diminished in this age and uh to where
[38:09] it just you know murders and uh suicides
[38:14] and things you know and it's just you
[38:16] know uh uh a lot of folks feeling that
[38:20] their their life isn't a value but
[38:24] brother brandom said even though our our
[38:26] ministry may be peculiar it all works
[38:30] together for the rest of the body ain't
[38:33] that right and so therefore uh we we
[38:37] cannot you know we cannot say well you
[38:41] know the holy man is the pope or the
[38:44] holy man is the bishop or you know
[38:47] looking at something else as something
[38:49] being holy or whatever as as man has for
[38:53] years and has been taught that it's only
[38:56] a certain group or it's only a certain
[38:58] person or a certain office that that is
[39:01] Holy and and and these things but
[39:04] brother brand would say the the holy man
[39:05] is Christ how many believes that the
[39:08] holy man is Christ and the Holy Spirit
[39:11] is in us so that Holy being is is within
[39:15] every one of us so he says well then how
[39:18] can you say the Ley has no word to say
[39:22] each one of you has something to
[39:26] say each one of you has got a work to do
[39:30] each one of you has got to carry a
[39:34] message ain't that right so every one of
[39:37] us has got something to do has got
[39:40] something to say we've got a message to
[39:43] carry amen and so a according to to what
[39:48] Jesus said the ones who are
[39:51] steadfast uh uh the one the Overcomer
[39:55] they're the ones that's going to sit
[39:57] with with him in his his throne amen so
[40:01] we must be steadfast in what God has
[40:04] called us to do now the word steadfast
[40:07] means firmly fixed in place it's it's uh
[40:13] not subject to change immovable loyal
[40:18] constant ain't that right now we're
[40:21] we're we're in a in a a a time of
[40:24] shifting sand everything is moving what
[40:28] used to be is is no longer everything is
[40:32] changing it it don't matter if it's
[40:34] policies or if it's convictions if it's
[40:37] home life it's in the church it's in our
[40:40] nation in our
[40:42] schools uh everything is changing so
[40:47] rapidly that you know it it it it's just
[40:51] mindboggling you know of of how fast
[40:53] things are really changing uh to where
[40:56] it does today doesn't resemble what what
[40:59] it was 50 years ago or or 30 years ago
[41:04] or or whatever and and so I I it comes
[41:08] to mind about you know in the restaurant
[41:11] um when when our church was uh there at
[41:15] the golden Crow and and everybody was
[41:18] coming through and and um uh when
[41:21] everybody come through you know the the
[41:23] young lady told me says boy y'all are
[41:25] ancient you know y'all remind me of the
[41:28] Bible days I said oh really well how's
[41:30] that so all the long hair and the
[41:32] dresses and all that the way y'all dress
[41:34] and you know and I'm thinking but that
[41:36] that was just a few years ago when
[41:38] everybody done that you know in the 50s
[41:41] um or 60s or whatever but uh but it
[41:45] changed so fast that we were dinosaur
[41:49] you know uh to her uh but but you know
[41:53] but here steadfast Amen in this world of
[41:56] ch change and everything just just uh uh
[42:01] uh not not staying the same yet God
[42:04] would tell us be steadfast
[42:07] immovable in the work in the work of the
[42:11] Lord now you know it seemed like maybe
[42:13] our our bodies are changing even and as
[42:17] we get older and and it seems uh in in
[42:20] different ways there's there's things
[42:22] about us that that change and and maybe
[42:26] our thoughts
[42:27] pattern would change as far as what we
[42:30] used to think as young young uh people
[42:33] versus up you know uh in in the older
[42:36] you know I I when I was younger you know
[42:39] I didn't think about you know checking
[42:41] the water before I dove you know into it
[42:44] I um I just saw it was nice and and I
[42:47] knew I could do it you know and and so
[42:50] then my dad comes and checks the water
[42:52] and he about has a cow you know and and
[42:55] um uh because I was ding way up there in
[42:58] waste deep water you know but it never
[43:00] just now for me to my boys to do that
[43:03] today I'd have a cow too but things
[43:06] change as you get older you you start
[43:08] your perceptions change and all that but
[43:11] there's one thing that must not change
[43:13] and that is our steadfastness in what
[43:16] God has called us to
[43:19] do another word for steadfast is is that
[43:23] we could use is the word faithful now uh
[43:27] in in t 2 Timothy 2 and 2 Paul wrote uh
[43:31] Timothy saying the things that thou Hast
[43:34] heard of me among many witnesses the
[43:38] same commit thou to Faithful Men amen
[43:43] don't just commit it to just anyone but
[43:46] commit it to Faithful Men Who Shall be
[43:48] able to teach others also ain't that
[43:52] right so so then then God is looking for
[43:56] steadfastness he's looking for faithful
[43:59] faithful men and women Amen to carry out
[44:03] the the ministry uh uh first uh
[44:06] Corinthians 4:2 it says it is required
[44:10] in in stewards that a man be found
[44:14] faithful or or steadfast so this is
[44:18] exactly what we are uh and that is
[44:21] stewards we're all stewards of what God
[44:25] has given us a men were were stewards
[44:28] and and and because we're we're all part
[44:31] of the work of the Lord this message
[44:34] that God has brought us in I I believe
[44:38] that he has put us in the message that
[44:41] that we could be stewards of the message
[44:44] how many believes that amen what
[44:46] whatever gift whatever calling whatever
[44:49] Talent whatever uh uh things that God
[44:52] has given us we are stewards of that uh
[44:56] of that Ministry of that gift that
[44:58] calling and and so uh uh well then how
[45:02] do we how how do we come into the work
[45:05] of the Lord do we come into it by
[45:08] accident is it just something that we
[45:10] want to do is it is it something well I
[45:13] I I want to you know I I want to be a
[45:16] deacon so I'm just going to do it or I
[45:18] want to be a musician so I'm going to do
[45:19] it and and and we find out that's not
[45:22] really uh uh uh not the way it it it
[45:26] works uh not everybody's called to be a
[45:28] deacon not everybody's called to be a
[45:30] song leader not everybody's called to be
[45:32] a musician not everybody's called to be
[45:34] a preacher and and all of these things
[45:36] but yet we've all got a Ministry but how
[45:38] did we get here you know I I think um uh
[45:42] uh 1 Timothy 1 and 12 uh Paul would tell
[45:46] about his own Ministry and his own self
[45:49] he says that I I think Christ Jesus our
[45:52] lord who hath enabled me everybody say
[45:56] he's enabled me who has enabled me for
[46:01] that he counted me faithful putting me
[46:05] into the ministry so Paul even himself
[46:09] is saying I did not become into the
[46:11] ministry by self desire or by my will or
[46:14] by my effort it was God who had enabled
[46:18] me and put me into the ministry a ain't
[46:23] that right and so if if if Paul was put
[46:27] into the ministry by God himself and was
[46:30] enabled by God well then that would show
[46:33] that we're all in in in that way we we
[46:37] are we come into the work by God putting
[46:40] us into the ministry and enabling us I I
[46:45] thought of you know I think it was
[46:46] Jeremiah God told him you know before
[46:48] thou was even conceived in your mother's
[46:50] womb I knew thee and I ordained thee to
[46:53] be a prophet see so so it comes from God
[46:57] Almighty ain't that right so it it is
[47:00] God that hath enabled us I I looked up
[47:03] this word enable it means to empower to
[47:07] strengthen to cause to operate amen now
[47:11] think of that he has enabled us he's
[47:14] caused us to operate he's caused us to
[47:16] function he's the one that's given us
[47:19] the ability to do what we do he's he's
[47:21] given us as as Paul would say I am what
[47:24] I am by the grace of God the grace of
[47:27] God was not just manifested when Paul
[47:29] gave his heart to God it was manifested
[47:32] in every part of his life it it was the
[47:35] grace of God that enabled him to to
[47:38] stand and to declare the gospel to Kings
[47:40] and to uh uh uh to to just regular
[47:44] people it was the grace of God that that
[47:46] Paul had and and of of to where that he
[47:50] could uh separate law and Grace it
[47:52] wasn't his own wisdom it was the grace
[47:55] of God everything thing about his life
[47:58] was by the grace of God God had enabled
[48:01] him and put him into the ministry ain't
[48:04] that right so I think of what Paul said
[48:08] he said he has saved us and called us
[48:10] with an holy calling not according to
[48:13] our works amen but according to his own
[48:17] purpose he he he is its own purpose
[48:20] Heath enabled us according to his own
[48:23] purpose he put us in the ministry
[48:25] according to his own purpose he's he's
[48:28] placed us where he wants us according to
[48:30] his own purpose do you believe that see
[48:34] and so he says his purpose and Grace
[48:36] which was given us in Christ Jesus
[48:39] before the foundation of the world Amen
[48:43] Jesus said also as we all know where he
[48:45] says you know you have not chosen me but
[48:48] I have chosen you and ordained you that
[48:51] you should bring forth fruit and that
[48:53] your fruit should remain and so there
[48:56] for we can truly say he hath enabled us
[49:00] we have been enabled by God remember
[49:03] what Zechariah the prophet would tell us
[49:06] it's not by might God speaking through
[49:08] that Prophet it's not by might nor by
[49:11] power but by my spirit sayith the Lord I
[49:14] think every day we ought to we ought to
[49:16] thank God for enabling us Amen to
[49:19] believe this message to live this
[49:21] message to to say Amen to the word of
[49:24] God to be able to come to the house of
[49:26] God amen it's it's by his spirit that
[49:29] we're able to do these things and we're
[49:32] being built up into the Most Holy Faith
[49:35] because God hath enabled us it's it's
[49:38] not us it's not our ability it's not our
[49:40] own thinking but God hath enabled Us by
[49:44] his Spirit can you say man you know uh
[49:48] uh one might say well I I just can't do
[49:50] it and we we must never come into this
[49:53] uh to where Satan gets us convinced that
[49:56] we're not not able to carry out the the
[49:59] the ministry that God has for us we we
[50:02] must never um we we we must never uh uh
[50:06] put ourselves down in in in a in a way
[50:10] to where that we insult God's
[50:13] intelligence by placing us into the
[50:16] ministry to where we say well I just
[50:18] can't do it I'm I'm not and and and and
[50:21] don't get me wrong I I think we all
[50:23] ought to feel in in that sense that that
[50:26] it's not us that we're not able to do it
[50:28] the moment we say well I'm the minister
[50:30] and everybody needs to listen to me well
[50:32] there's something wrong there but but
[50:34] then Satan can get us to the point to
[50:36] where we say well I'm just not a
[50:38] minister and I'm just not good enough
[50:40] and so we we therefore we don't try we
[50:42] therefore we we just sit on a on a Pew
[50:45] backsliding because we just don't feel
[50:47] like we're able to do anything well if
[50:50] if Satan gets us into that place well
[50:53] then God can't use us you you understand
[50:55] what I'm saying amen see so so uh uh
[51:00] anything that God has called us to do
[51:03] you can do it everybody say I can do it
[51:06] you can do it if God has called you and
[51:11] if he's called you then he's enabled you
[51:15] and and and placed you there so so it
[51:18] all has to come from God Jesus was
[51:21] predestinated to do what he did and to
[51:24] be what he was amen and and we can truly
[51:27] say he was
[51:29] enabled by God to fulfill a the purpose
[51:34] that God had predestinated him to amen
[51:38] for Luke 4 and8 and this is where Jesus
[51:41] was amen and this is he he knew that the
[51:44] scripture had spoke of him he he had
[51:47] this understanding that I do have a
[51:49] purpose in life and and and and and my
[51:53] purpose is spoken of in the scriptures
[51:55] and the prophets have spoken of me and
[51:58] and so therefore he could take the
[52:00] scriptures and and and apply it to his
[52:03] life and say this is who I am but but
[52:07] yet he knew that it had to be not just
[52:10] him as a man trying to accomplish what
[52:13] God had called him to do but notice he
[52:16] said the spirit of the Lord is upon me
[52:20] aren't you glad for that the spirit of
[52:22] the Lord is upon me because he hath
[52:25] anointed me well why did he anoint him
[52:28] to preach the gospel in other words to
[52:31] do everything that God had predestinated
[52:34] for him to do God now placed his Spirit
[52:38] upon Him amen and and and uh it not in a
[52:42] measure like maybe we would have but the
[52:45] fullness of the spirit of God Came Upon
[52:48] him and lived in him and anointed him
[52:52] ain't that right he was anointed to
[52:54] preach the gospel to the poor we can say
[52:56] he was enabled Amen to to heal the
[52:59] brokenhearted to preach the Deliverance
[53:01] to the captives and the recovering of
[53:04] sight to the blind to sit at Liberty
[53:06] them that are bruised to proclaim the
[53:08] acceptable year of the Lord see he was
[53:11] anointed he was enabled he was placed in
[53:14] the ministry if if if we could say it
[53:17] that way I understand that he was God
[53:19] but yet he was man amen and and as a man
[53:22] he couldn't do nothing as a man he
[53:24] couldn't raise from the dead as a man he
[53:27] couldn't uh walk up to Calvary as as as
[53:30] just an ordinary individual amen but God
[53:34] was with him God had ordained him for
[53:36] such a Ministry and and no matter how
[53:39] small no matter how great no matter how
[53:41] hard no matter how whatever it was he
[53:44] was able to accomplish what God had had
[53:48] called him to do his purpose in life can
[53:50] you say Amen well that's the same way
[53:53] you could look at your trials you could
[53:54] look at the obstacles and you say well
[53:56] there ain't no way amen and and we're in
[53:58] a generation that we we want it easy
[54:01] amen it's an age where people just want
[54:03] things so easy they don't want fight for
[54:05] it they don't want to have to you know
[54:08] strive for it they they they they you
[54:10] know they want everything their way and
[54:13] and how they want it when they want it
[54:15] and all these things see amen but but we
[54:17] realize that if we're in the ministry in
[54:20] the work of the Lord that is totally
[54:22] different God doesn't give everything
[54:24] the way we want it God doesn't do
[54:26] everything that we we think he should do
[54:28] and and and and everything isn't just
[54:31] handed to us uh on a silver platter
[54:34] that's why he says be steadfast in the
[54:37] work of the Lord there's going to be
[54:39] times that are are good times there's
[54:40] going to be times that are rough times
[54:42] there's going to be times that everybody
[54:44] accepts you and then there's times
[54:46] everybody rejects you and and and all
[54:48] these things this was the Life of Christ
[54:51] amen the one moment they're applauding
[54:53] him the other moment they're driving
[54:54] nails in his hands and and uh you know
[54:57] and and all of these things but be ye
[55:00] steadfast in the work of the
[55:02] lord it's it's not that we demand God to
[55:06] to do things God put us in the ministry
[55:10] in the work of the Lord to fulfill his
[55:13] will and and so you are as as Christ was
[55:17] you are anointed to fulfill the purpose
[55:21] that God has ordained you to fulfill and
[55:24] without that anointing you're nothing
[55:27] without the anointing I'm nothing you
[55:30] understand that see it it's not that
[55:32] what makes me a good preacher is I went
[55:33] to school and and I had Seminary and I
[55:36] can speak good language and and and and
[55:38] and put a program together that's not it
[55:41] it's the anointing that makes the
[55:43] difference can you sayen see so a man
[55:47] will fail now notice a man will fail
[55:50] when he tries to do something apart from
[55:53] what he's anointed to do amen when you
[55:56] when you're anointed then you have the
[55:58] same Authority as or same power as
[56:02] Samson did when he carried away the
[56:04] gates of a city when you're anointed
[56:08] that that's the that's the difference
[56:09] the anointing makes the difference you
[56:12] you have the same Authority as David did
[56:15] amen when he defeated the bear defeated
[56:17] the lion and and ultimately defeated
[56:20] Goliath amen see you have that same
[56:23] Authority when you're anointed you have
[56:25] the same power as as Samson did when he
[56:28] killed a thousand Philistines amen with
[56:31] with the Jawbone of a donkey you have
[56:33] that same Authority Amen to defeat uh
[56:37] the enemy as as shamard did when he
[56:41] defeated and uh uh 600 Philistines amen
[56:45] with just an ox gold see he was anointed
[56:48] to do that you understand see and we're
[56:50] anointed to do what we're doing amen
[56:53] when you're anointed you have the same
[56:55] Authority as Joshua did when he stood
[56:58] there and commanded the son to stand
[57:00] still and the son obeyed his word it was
[57:03] an anointing ain't that right see God
[57:06] had placed him there God had ordained
[57:09] him for the call for the for what he was
[57:12] doing now in the anointing when Jesus
[57:15] said thee Heath anointed me amen well
[57:18] the anointing as the prophet said it
[57:20] didn't make him run around the building
[57:22] and scream and holler and shout and he
[57:25] said then things are blessings he said
[57:27] but that that's not the anointing if you
[57:29] look when when Jesus said Heath anointed
[57:32] me and he and he began to described why
[57:35] he was anointed then the Bible says he
[57:37] just closed the book handed it back and
[57:40] sat down and precious words proceeded
[57:43] from his mouth can you say Amen so
[57:46] brother Brown said see that's what Jesus
[57:48] done under the anointing so he says see
[57:51] the anointing is not
[57:54] emotions there there's going to be times
[57:56] in your ministry in your in your daily
[57:58] walk where there's not going to be
[58:00] emotions and and Satan will will will
[58:03] cause you to to to to maybe to to wonder
[58:07] you know am am I even in the will of God
[58:10] I I don't see things moving like I used
[58:12] to and and maybe everything's just not
[58:15] exciting as it used to be but see that
[58:18] doesn't change the anointing the
[58:20] anointing is not
[58:23] emotions can you say amen amen and the
[58:26] anointing he said is supreme power in
[58:30] control like knowing exactly what and
[58:33] how and that's what's here can you say
[58:36] Amen see so the anointing don't don't
[58:39] get anointing mixed up with emotions and
[58:42] excitement and I I believe in excitement
[58:45] I love emotions and and I can be an
[58:48] emotional guy you know and and and and
[58:51] you know I I I get excited about things
[58:53] and and and and so uh but that doesn't
[58:56] mean that you know that that that that's
[58:58] the anointing when the emotions leave
[59:01] amen that anointing still there so so
[59:04] that's where Jesus was you know when
[59:06] when he was you know he was anointed
[59:08] when he uh turned the water into wine
[59:11] amen that was an anointing do you
[59:12] believe that but he was still anointed
[59:15] when the 70 walked away from him he was
[59:17] anointed when when he uh uh healed the
[59:20] the the blind man blind bmus and yet he
[59:24] was anointed amen when he began to open
[59:27] the word and said except you eat my
[59:29] flesh and drink my blood you have no
[59:31] life in me see and and so that there was
[59:34] an anointing and yet different phases of
[59:37] his ministry but he was steadfast and no
[59:41] matter what phase it was whe whether it
[59:43] was uh uh uh uh uh you know uh uh
[59:47] feeding the 5,000 and or or walking up
[59:50] to to golgatha or whatever it was he was
[59:54] steadfast in what God had purposed him
[59:56] to
[59:59] do uh 2 Corinthians
[1:00:03] 1:21 Paul would tell us now he which
[1:00:06] establishe us us with you in
[1:00:10] Christ uh and hath anointed us is God
[1:00:15] Amen your anointing comes from God your
[1:00:19] calling comes from God your placing
[1:00:21] comes from God your purpose comes from
[1:00:25] God you believe
[1:00:27] that amen we must believe
[1:00:30] that now brother Bram said speaking of
[1:00:34] his own Ministry he said it is a
[1:00:36] privilege to operate myself under the
[1:00:39] Divine anointing of God's supreme power
[1:00:42] in whatever Ministry that he would
[1:00:45] choose that he would yeah chose for me
[1:00:49] to serve in so I'll say that again it is
[1:00:52] a privilege he's saying this for himself
[1:00:54] it is a privilege to operate myself
[1:00:57] under the Divine anointing of God's
[1:00:59] supreme power in whatever Ministry that
[1:01:02] he would chose for me to serve in I just
[1:01:06] serve the best that I can with all that
[1:01:09] I have to serve
[1:01:12] with can you say amen for David when he
[1:01:15] was when he was faced with the the giant
[1:01:18] he only had five stones but he would
[1:01:21] yield that to
[1:01:23] God he would serve his Ministry he would
[1:01:26] serve God in whatever he
[1:01:29] had right Lord Samson the same way
[1:01:34] shamard the same way all all of them
[1:01:38] they they whatever they had they it they
[1:01:41] serve god with what they had with what
[1:01:44] they had to use ain't that right so he
[1:01:48] says see I just serve the best that I
[1:01:50] can with all that I have to serve with
[1:01:53] and trusting that someday when it's all
[1:01:55] over over he will say it was well done
[1:02:00] how many wants God to save that amen I
[1:02:02] want God to save that about my life it
[1:02:04] is well
[1:02:06] done when it's all said and done it it
[1:02:09] doesn't matter if I preached a 10,000 or
[1:02:11] just one as long as it was in God's plan
[1:02:16] as long as I fulfilled the purpose that
[1:02:18] God has called me I just want to hear
[1:02:20] him say it's well done for I will hear
[1:02:23] the same word that the prophet will hear
[1:02:26] right amen I'll hear the words that you
[1:02:30] will hear well done can you say Amen so
[1:02:34] he says see he will say Well done See
[1:02:36] For What Little I had to do with For
[1:02:40] What Little I had to do with you don't
[1:02:42] have a lot you don't need a lot but just
[1:02:46] what little you have to do with he says
[1:02:50] I did the best that I could with what I
[1:02:52] had to do with so I'm trusting that he
[1:02:55] will understand stand and say Well done
[1:02:57] is what my desire is I me wants to hear
[1:03:00] him say Well done well done not not to
[1:03:04] look at you as some defeated or or uh uh
[1:03:07] uh I I know he ain't going to look at
[1:03:09] his bride as that way you may have your
[1:03:11] scars you may have your battle wounds
[1:03:13] and and you may have whatever but but
[1:03:16] that is a true
[1:03:17] Soldier they didn't just stand on the
[1:03:19] sidelines and let everybody else fight
[1:03:22] and let everybody else go through it and
[1:03:24] let everybody else why we just want to
[1:03:26] just uh uh skim our way through and and
[1:03:28] all that no everyone that faces God
[1:03:31] every one of God's soldiers are going to
[1:03:33] have Battle Scars they're going to have
[1:03:34] wounds they're they're going to have
[1:03:36] scars they're going to they're going to
[1:03:38] show they're going to have witnesses
[1:03:40] that they were a soldier in this
[1:03:43] thing be steadfast
[1:03:47] true and you say
[1:03:50] Amen see we're called to do something
[1:03:52] for the Lord
[1:03:56] this you know God has given us talents
[1:04:00] gifts he's given us the message for this
[1:04:04] day now here's the sobering thing what
[1:04:07] God has called us to do we will give an
[1:04:09] account
[1:04:10] to we will give an account to him
[1:04:13] for and so this is what brother brandham
[1:04:16] said we do everything we can
[1:04:19] reverently right that's what we want to
[1:04:22] do if if we're ministered you do it
[1:04:25] reverently you hold that office
[1:04:28] reverently if you're a deacon if you're
[1:04:29] a musician if you're just a lay member
[1:04:32] if you're just a janitor if you're just
[1:04:34] the a Manor if you're just a singer or
[1:04:37] whatever if you're just do you know
[1:04:39] using your 10 strings or I think brother
[1:04:41] brand called it you know just clapping
[1:04:43] hands amen whatever God has done you you
[1:04:46] take that
[1:04:47] reverently you do it with reverence we
[1:04:50] do everything we can reverently knowing
[1:04:53] that we'll have to answer from the least
[1:04:55] little gift unto the highest at the day
[1:04:59] of the judgment and I want to be found a
[1:05:01] good Steward of the Lord's business at
[1:05:04] that day how mean wants to be good
[1:05:06] stewards at that day well I want to be I
[1:05:09] I want to be a good Steward I want to be
[1:05:11] found faithful I want to be one that was
[1:05:13] there that stood the test and and kept
[1:05:17] pressing on
[1:05:21] regardless so we want to take our
[1:05:24] calling and our election
[1:05:26] seriously we want to take what God has
[1:05:29] called us to do seriously
[1:05:33] reverently can you say
[1:05:35] Amen now we know everyone has a
[1:05:38] different position we all are called to
[1:05:41] different places and positions and in
[1:05:44] the body of Christ different
[1:05:47] callings and and this is what Paul would
[1:05:50] tell us in Romans 12:4 breaking in as as
[1:05:54] as we have many members in one body and
[1:05:58] all men members have not the same office
[1:06:01] so we being many are one body in Christ
[1:06:05] and everyone members of one
[1:06:07] another so so we we we're all members of
[1:06:11] of something uh of the body within the
[1:06:14] body and and and they all go together to
[1:06:17] work for the
[1:06:19] body amen you might be the the little
[1:06:23] nerve you might be the nerve that gets
[1:06:25] on
[1:06:26] you know that hurts a
[1:06:29] lot you might be the
[1:06:32] liver you might be the heart you might
[1:06:34] be what whatever in the body but you
[1:06:36] you're part of the body you might be the
[1:06:38] little toenail on the little pinky but
[1:06:41] you're just as important as anyone else
[1:06:44] every part of the body has a function
[1:06:47] and it's a
[1:06:49] Ministry and if you don't think your
[1:06:51] little toe's important cut it
[1:06:53] off and see what happen happens yes it's
[1:06:57] it's there to help keep us balanced our
[1:07:00] big toe there to help keep us balanced
[1:07:02] where we can walk
[1:07:04] right ain't that right see every little
[1:07:07] part God put there not just for an
[1:07:09] addition he put there for a
[1:07:12] purpose well that's the same way in in
[1:07:15] in the body of Christ God wouldn't have
[1:07:18] put us there if if we didn't have a an
[1:07:20] important role in the
[1:07:23] body do you believe that amen now now
[1:07:26] the prophet says now the problem is is
[1:07:28] we're all wanting to take another
[1:07:29] person's
[1:07:30] place and and and and this is where the
[1:07:33] confusion is amen everybody wants to
[1:07:36] take another person's Place everybody is
[1:07:39] is is disregards the other person's
[1:07:43] place they want to take so they
[1:07:45] disregard their place they disregard the
[1:07:48] other person's Place uh there A lot of
[1:07:52] times there there's you know in in the
[1:07:54] natural there's a lot of
[1:07:56] disrespect uh am among this
[1:08:00] generation we we don't value the other
[1:08:03] person's place but also we don't value
[1:08:05] our own
[1:08:07] position and and then you know uh well
[1:08:12] you you know the way the world works and
[1:08:14] the spirit of the age that we're living
[1:08:16] in but we don't want to spend our
[1:08:19] time devaluing someone else but we also
[1:08:22] don't want to spend our time devaluing
[1:08:24] Who We Are
[1:08:26] amen and and we do that when we try to
[1:08:28] take somebody else position when we look
[1:08:32] and say well I'm just not I'm not
[1:08:33] getting enough Glory or I'm just not if
[1:08:36] you know uh I I'm you know I I I'm going
[1:08:38] to use this for the example but
[1:08:40] everybody you know God raised brother
[1:08:41] Andrew Glover you know and and uh uh to
[1:08:46] be a full-time evangelist he's got such
[1:08:48] a powerful Ministry God has blessed him
[1:08:50] in that way and how many young other
[1:08:53] young ministers want to be just like
[1:08:55] that oh and they feel like they're not
[1:08:58] doing much if if they're not doing what
[1:09:00] he's done but God never called them to
[1:09:03] be an Andrew Glover Andrew Glover didn't
[1:09:06] call him to be an Andrew Glover you
[1:09:09] understand God enabled him to do what
[1:09:12] he's doing to be what he
[1:09:14] is you understand what I'm saying so
[1:09:17] that doesn't take away from our ministry
[1:09:19] it doesn't take away from the teacher it
[1:09:21] doesn't take away from the pastor it
[1:09:23] doesn't take away amen from the helps of
[1:09:25] governments in the
[1:09:28] church ain't that right so so God may
[1:09:32] have called you to preach the gospel but
[1:09:34] he may have not called you to evangelize
[1:09:36] so quit trying to evangelize quit quit
[1:09:39] trying to be out there Wishing Well I
[1:09:41] wished I could be this and I wished I
[1:09:42] could do that and I wished I could do
[1:09:44] this and I you spend your whole life
[1:09:46] trying to be something else and wishing
[1:09:48] you were why not enjoy what God called
[1:09:50] you to be
[1:09:55] can you say Amen see we we don't want to
[1:09:58] be an impersonator God never called us
[1:10:01] to be an impersonator my my liver is not
[1:10:05] an impersonator my my little pinky on my
[1:10:09] is on my right left hand is not an
[1:10:11] impersonator of the right hand it it all
[1:10:14] goes together it all has a job it all
[1:10:17] has its own
[1:10:19] purpose hello you can still say Amen now
[1:10:24] see so we don't want to be an
[1:10:26] impersonator of others we want to do
[1:10:28] what God has called us to do and be
[1:10:32] steadfast in
[1:10:35] it can you say
[1:10:37] Amen see and and so uh now church we
[1:10:42] will only be effective we will only be
[1:10:46] effective in the place that God has
[1:10:48] called us to be my good friend uh
[1:10:51] Brother Scott Smith he once said to me
[1:10:54] he said you know God may have called you
[1:10:56] to
[1:10:57] pastor but he didn't call you to Pastor
[1:11:00] every
[1:11:03] church so then if he called me to Pastor
[1:11:06] in other words then it's not my choice
[1:11:09] to say well I'm called a pastor so what
[1:11:11] church do I want to
[1:11:13] Pastor God has called me to pastor but
[1:11:17] then I have to find out what where he
[1:11:21] wants me to
[1:11:22] Pastor you understand God May called you
[1:11:25] to be a musician to help in the church
[1:11:27] but then you have to find out where what
[1:11:29] church he's called you to be and then be
[1:11:32] steadfast see see God wants us all to be
[1:11:35] steadfast can you say Amen see so a man
[1:11:38] may do what God has called him to do but
[1:11:41] yet fail in doing that because he isn't
[1:11:46] where God wants him to
[1:11:48] be I'll say that again a man may do what
[1:11:52] God has called him to do but yet fail in
[1:11:56] that because he's not where God called
[1:11:59] him to
[1:12:00] be can you say Amen see see no one can
[1:12:05] take my
[1:12:06] place no one can take your place you
[1:12:10] can't take mine I can't take
[1:12:12] yours no matter how much I want to be
[1:12:15] brother Terry God's called me to preach
[1:12:17] the gospel God called you to preach the
[1:12:18] gospel but I can't live my life wishing
[1:12:21] to be you and you can't try to be me I
[1:12:23] can't take your we're both preachers
[1:12:25] brother Amos we're both
[1:12:28] preachers but I can't take brother
[1:12:30] amos's place he can't take my place if I
[1:12:33] try to be brother Amos and and being is
[1:12:35] God will never bless even though I'm
[1:12:36] called to be a
[1:12:40] preacher can you say Amen see so no one
[1:12:43] can take our place but what God has
[1:12:45] called us to do we must remember it is a
[1:12:48] special
[1:12:50] calling it's special how many believes
[1:12:53] that I I believe that that me being here
[1:12:56] it's a special it's an honor that God
[1:12:58] would Place me here because see if if if
[1:13:02] I say well I I want to be like someone
[1:13:04] else and I want to do what they're doing
[1:13:05] I want to be what they're doing and and
[1:13:07] and I'll fail in that while they're
[1:13:09] succeeding in it but as long as I can do
[1:13:12] and be where God wants me to be I will
[1:13:15] be
[1:13:18] successful and so will
[1:13:21] you can you say amen amen now first
[1:13:25] Corinthians 12:12 for as the body is one
[1:13:28] and hath many members and all the
[1:13:30] members of that one body being many are
[1:13:33] one body so also is
[1:13:35] Christ for by one Spirit we're all
[1:13:38] baptized into one body whether we be
[1:13:40] Jews or Gentiles whether we be Bond or
[1:13:42] free and have been all made to drink
[1:13:45] into one spirit for the body is not one
[1:13:47] member but many right if the foot shall
[1:13:50] say well because I'm not the hand I'm
[1:13:52] not of the body is it therefore not of
[1:13:54] the body
[1:13:56] if the ear shall say well because I'm
[1:13:58] not the eye I'm not of the body is it
[1:14:00] therefore not of the body if the whole
[1:14:03] body were an eye where were the hearing
[1:14:05] if the whole were the hearing where were
[1:14:07] the smelling but now hath God set the
[1:14:10] members every one of them in the body as
[1:14:13] it hath pleased him
[1:14:16] amen and you say Amen so we get
[1:14:19] discouraged sometimes so we want to quit
[1:14:22] sometimes so we want to just whatever
[1:14:25] and if we act upon our feelings if we
[1:14:28] act upon
[1:14:29] impulse no matter what we do in this
[1:14:32] life we're still going to give an
[1:14:33] account
[1:14:35] true
[1:14:37] amen no matter how unsuccessful you may
[1:14:40] feel in your ministry you just can't
[1:14:43] quit
[1:14:45] it because you're still going to give an
[1:14:49] account my feelings does not change
[1:14:52] God's mind about it
[1:14:55] the way I think it should or not should
[1:14:58] or whatever it ain't going to change
[1:15:00] God's
[1:15:03] mind so therefore I've got to be
[1:15:05] steadfast in whatever God has called us
[1:15:08] to
[1:15:09] do God has called me to do God called
[1:15:11] you to do you must be steadfast in that
[1:15:13] can you say Amen now every Son of God
[1:15:17] and I hope this all right tonight but
[1:15:19] every every Son of God has been given
[1:15:21] the
[1:15:22] authority that Jesus had do you believe
[1:15:25] that the same Authority
[1:15:27] amen you've been given the same
[1:15:30] Authority we have different callings
[1:15:33] different positions different Ministries
[1:15:35] but we all have the same Authority that
[1:15:38] Jesus had as sons of God brother Bram
[1:15:42] said from the least member in the body
[1:15:44] to the greatest we've all been given the
[1:15:46] same Authority Lord now to think of this
[1:15:50] of being steadfast uh it would require
[1:15:53] us then to be prisoners to
[1:15:58] Christ and you know there's different
[1:16:01] kinds of prisoners you can be a prisoner
[1:16:03] against your
[1:16:05] will but then brother Brandon would call
[1:16:08] us
[1:16:09] prisoners he said prisoners of
[1:16:13] love that's that's the difference God
[1:16:16] God doesn't have
[1:16:18] prisoners that are held against their
[1:16:21] will he has prisoners of love all
[1:16:26] right they're willful
[1:16:32] prisoners so you have to be a prisoner
[1:16:36] to him everybody say I have to be a
[1:16:40] prisoner if you're going to abound in
[1:16:43] the work of the
[1:16:44] Lord if you're going to stand immovable
[1:16:47] steadfast and
[1:16:49] abound you've got to be a prisoner to
[1:16:51] him and not a prisoner against your will
[1:16:55] but a prisoner of
[1:16:57] love to where it's it's a
[1:17:00] desire I love to be a Christian I love
[1:17:04] to do what he wants me to do see it it
[1:17:08] becomes a willful
[1:17:09] surrender it becomes a
[1:17:13] willful it it it's it's a uh
[1:17:18] uh it's something that you offer
[1:17:23] yourself so if a man is a l servant a l
[1:17:28] prisoner then he willfully surrenders
[1:17:31] everything the word volunteer is what
[1:17:34] I'm looking for you become the
[1:17:36] volunteer you willfully surrender
[1:17:39] everything to your master because you
[1:17:42] are a love servant you you you become a
[1:17:45] prisoner of
[1:17:47] love and so as loved Servants of Christ
[1:17:51] then we surrender our thoughts the
[1:17:54] prophet would
[1:17:56] say we surrender our own will our
[1:17:59] motives our
[1:18:01] desire because see when when we're put
[1:18:04] in the
[1:18:05] ministry then we don't run that Ministry
[1:18:08] based upon our own ideas and our own
[1:18:11] thoughts because you got to remember
[1:18:13] Jesus come to that place where he said
[1:18:14] if it be thy will father let this cup
[1:18:16] pass from me according to his flesh he
[1:18:19] did not want to go to
[1:18:21] Calvary amen but as a love slave as a
[1:18:27] prisoner of love he would say but
[1:18:29] nevertheless thy will be
[1:18:32] done he surrendered himself to the will
[1:18:35] of the father he surrendered his
[1:18:37] ambition he he surrendered his dream he
[1:18:39] surrendered
[1:18:41] everything
[1:18:43] right we we surrender as love servants
[1:18:46] as love slaves we surrender our goals we
[1:18:49] surrender our dreams our wants our
[1:18:51] desires can you say Amen say God God
[1:18:55] didn't call us to abound in what we
[1:18:59] want God didn't call us to abound in our
[1:19:02] own dreams and our own
[1:19:05] desires
[1:19:07] hello he wants us to abound in the work
[1:19:11] of the
[1:19:13] Lord whatever he called you to do abound
[1:19:16] in
[1:19:19] that sometimes it's going to go against
[1:19:21] your will sometimes it's going to it's
[1:19:23] going to cause you to cry out out your
[1:19:25] flesh to cry out and scream out if this
[1:19:28] cup if if it be your will let this let
[1:19:31] this cup pass from me I I don't want to
[1:19:33] face
[1:19:34] this but because you are a love
[1:19:37] slave you
[1:19:42] surrender and that's what God wants you
[1:19:44] to abound in abound in the work of the
[1:19:46] Lord be steadfast
[1:19:48] immovable always
[1:19:51] abounding Lord God didn't call us to be
[1:19:53] Dwarfs that's right he didn't call us to
[1:19:56] dry up he didn't call us to to walk away
[1:20:02] from his purpose so that we could do
[1:20:04] what we want to do and then when life
[1:20:06] gets easier we come back and and and and
[1:20:08] and no no that's not
[1:20:10] it um brother bran would call it
[1:20:13] wandering stars or uh the there's
[1:20:17] another word that he would use it to
[1:20:18] where we just Bounce from one place to
[1:20:20] another Bounce from one place to another
[1:20:22] it's it's kind of like where we we we we
[1:20:24] going from one Revival to another
[1:20:26] Revival wherever the move is that's
[1:20:28] where we want to be wherever the the
[1:20:30] wherever the thing is is is going that's
[1:20:32] where we want to be part of but
[1:20:34] sometimes that's not the part of God's
[1:20:36] will for
[1:20:43] you yeah
[1:20:45] Drifters so see so God doesn't want us
[1:20:49] to abound in what we want we are to
[1:20:51] abound in the work of the Lord now when
[1:20:54] we look look at Joseph in the Old
[1:20:56] Testament of course you look at his
[1:20:57] whole life his life was a um well it was
[1:21:02] ordained of God we see that it was
[1:21:04] predestined of God every everything
[1:21:07] about him uh because he was
[1:21:09] representative of Christ he didn't know
[1:21:11] he was he was just living his life and
[1:21:15] look at the ups and downs look at the
[1:21:16] times you know he was he was in anointed
[1:21:18] he had dreams he was loved of his father
[1:21:22] he even had the he was the the the the
[1:21:25] Lov loved one beloved one his father
[1:21:28] gave him the the the coat of many colors
[1:21:31] he he even his own Brothers noticed that
[1:21:33] he was loved more by his father than
[1:21:36] they
[1:21:36] were and and all these things so Joseph
[1:21:39] had an easy life at the
[1:21:41] beginning but but
[1:21:44] then then he was
[1:21:47] betrayed he was
[1:21:49] sold he was lied against
[1:21:53] right thrown into prison everything
[1:21:56] though of his life was ordained of
[1:22:01] God now brother brandham said see when
[1:22:04] he had come when Joseph come to the
[1:22:06] throne though all of this down here had
[1:22:10] a meaning it had a purpose to get him up
[1:22:13] here to the throne and brother brah said
[1:22:16] see he had power to bind at his own word
[1:22:19] speaking of Joseph remember he come out
[1:22:21] of prison and was exalted to the throne
[1:22:24] he had power to loose at his own word he
[1:22:27] could say I loose you in the name of my
[1:22:29] king see because Pharaoh made Joseph his
[1:22:32] son well see Christ makes his prisoners
[1:22:36] of love his sons and he gives them power
[1:22:41] the same kind he had Lord oh don't miss
[1:22:46] that don't miss that God giv you the
[1:22:48] power The Authority as
[1:22:51] Sons don't look at the insignificance of
[1:22:54] maybe you feel well I ain't getting
[1:22:57] anywhere well my Ministry is just not
[1:22:59] like everybody else but you're missing
[1:23:01] the fact that God gave you the same
[1:23:09] power so he said see he he gives them
[1:23:13] power the same thing he had St John
[1:23:16] 14:12 he that believeth on me the works
[1:23:17] that I do shall he do also even more
[1:23:20] than this shall he do see so now the
[1:23:23] prisoner of the love of Christ becomes
[1:23:25] empowered by his King who is
[1:23:29] Christ every prisoner of Love That is a
[1:23:33] prisoner to Christ becomes
[1:23:37] empowered by his King and verily I say
[1:23:41] unto you if you say to this mountain be
[1:23:43] moved and don't doubt in your heart but
[1:23:45] believe that what you've said will come
[1:23:46] to pass you shall have what you said if
[1:23:50] you abide in me and my word abide in you
[1:23:52] if you're yoke to me because him and his
[1:23:54] word is the same in the beginning was
[1:23:56] the word the word was with God the word
[1:23:58] was made flesh and dwelt Among Us same
[1:24:00] yesterday today and forever so if you
[1:24:02] abide in me not in here and there but
[1:24:04] abide in me and my word in you then ask
[1:24:07] what you will or say what you will and
[1:24:10] it'll be done see he had power ain't
[1:24:13] that right see now he says now notice
[1:24:16] before he come out speaking of Joseph he
[1:24:18] had to be taken out and
[1:24:22] shaved ain't that right see a few things
[1:24:25] had to be shaved off before he could
[1:24:27] meet his
[1:24:29] King he says oh God sometimes takes his
[1:24:32] people out like that and shaves a few
[1:24:35] off of their own wheel uh shave a few of
[1:24:38] their own wheels off shows them that
[1:24:41] they can't do just what they wanted to
[1:24:43] do and you know what I mean they're not
[1:24:46] in Liberty to do what they want to do
[1:24:47] before they come into full power and to
[1:24:51] and be a love slave to Christ they have
[1:24:53] to be shaved off and then presented
[1:24:55] sometimes he takes them to the desert to
[1:24:57] do that to shave them off and then bring
[1:24:59] them out the anointed one to fulfill the
[1:25:02] purpose that he's ordained them to be
[1:25:06] can you say Amen a love slave see you
[1:25:10] got to abound in the work of the Lord
[1:25:12] you got to be a love slave you got to be
[1:25:15] willing to accept his will for your life
[1:25:18] you got to be willing to accept what he
[1:25:20] he's called you to
[1:25:22] do amen ain't that right I hope it makes
[1:25:26] sense to you tonight but see Moses Moses
[1:25:30] remember he was
[1:25:31] called but notice what a prophet said he
[1:25:34] had to forsake everything he
[1:25:36] knew forget all his training and
[1:25:39] everything in order to to know the will
[1:25:41] of God and to follow God he can't follow
[1:25:44] anything that man has got got to do and
[1:25:47] God see the same time you can't follow
[1:25:50] man and you can't follow God at the same
[1:25:53] time amen you can't abound in in in your
[1:25:56] dreams and your ideas and abound in the
[1:25:59] work of the Lord at the same time cuz
[1:26:01] somewhere our dreams are going to
[1:26:03] contradict the will of God for our
[1:26:08] lives our Ambitions our goals and
[1:26:10] everything else it's humanly speaking
[1:26:12] none of us want to go and and die out of
[1:26:15] Calvary none of us amen want to be
[1:26:17] rejected none of us want to go through
[1:26:19] the things that God has called us to do
[1:26:21] in a in a lot of ways sometimes you got
[1:26:23] to stand well brother Brown said a man
[1:26:25] that walks with God has to stand
[1:26:27] [Music]
[1:26:30] alone see so he can't follow anything
[1:26:33] that man has got to do and God the same
[1:26:35] time is too contrary one to another see
[1:26:38] our dreams our Ambitions our goals our
[1:26:41] whatever we want is too contrary to what
[1:26:43] God wants of
[1:26:46] us he said you can't be going right and
[1:26:48] left at the same time you can't be doing
[1:26:51] right and wrong at the same time you
[1:26:53] can't be following man and God at the
[1:26:55] same time you're either following God or
[1:26:57] you're following man and then if you're
[1:26:59] following God and have submitted
[1:27:01] yourself to God then you become a
[1:27:03] prisoner to that God to that word to
[1:27:06] that will and no matter what anything
[1:27:08] else says you become a prisoner to
[1:27:12] it now you become abounding you're
[1:27:15] immovable
[1:27:17] steadfast can you say Amen now do you
[1:27:20] realize in as he's put us in the
[1:27:22] ministry
[1:27:24] as he's enabled us to fulfill the
[1:27:28] purpose we are ordained to be sons
[1:27:31] having authority over the
[1:27:35] devil you believe
[1:27:38] that but it's in your position remember
[1:27:42] brother brand talks about the the the
[1:27:43] missionary that wanted to go to Africa I
[1:27:45] think it was in Africa and he went to
[1:27:47] his board the board of his church
[1:27:51] denomination or whatever and he told him
[1:27:53] what he felt God had called him to do
[1:27:55] and they said oh you can't do that you
[1:27:56] can't take your family over there he had
[1:27:58] you know he had little children and and
[1:28:00] a wife and he said you can't do that
[1:28:03] there's malaria and there's this and and
[1:28:05] they just brought up all the dangers he
[1:28:08] said there ain't no way you can go and
[1:28:10] his reply was men
[1:28:14] Brethren all I know is God called me to
[1:28:16] go and I would be more safer over there
[1:28:20] in all of that in the will of God than I
[1:28:23] would be out outside the will of
[1:28:25] God can you say amen and and that's the
[1:28:28] same way if we're in the will of God be
[1:28:31] steadfast in that wheel be steadfast
[1:28:34] unmovable you're more safe there than
[1:28:37] you would be anywhere
[1:28:39] else amen because you're sons of God
[1:28:43] abounding in the work of God God doesn't
[1:28:46] leave you
[1:28:47] helpless sometimes you may feel helpless
[1:28:50] maybe you think oh God where you at what
[1:28:53] what's going on on what's Happening may
[1:28:56] you look at maybe we look at the church
[1:28:57] or maybe we look at our home maybe we
[1:28:59] look at our own lives and everything
[1:29:01] just you know it just doesn't seem to be
[1:29:03] the happening thing but if you can
[1:29:06] understand and know and and take the
[1:29:08] comfort that I am in the will of God and
[1:29:12] no matter what Devil comes my way I have
[1:29:14] that Authority Amen to defeat
[1:29:18] him you believe that you see I I I will
[1:29:22] tell you and you all know it the devil's
[1:29:23] going to try to knock you out of your
[1:29:26] place
[1:29:28] right he he'll get you to have a complex
[1:29:31] about
[1:29:32] yourself well I'm just I'm just not able
[1:29:34] I just I I just don't know I ain't worth
[1:29:36] much I ain't just this and I ain't yeah
[1:29:38] I I just don't know see that's the devil
[1:29:41] trying to knock you out of your
[1:29:44] place yeah but everybody laughs at me
[1:29:46] well they laughed at Jesus too amen they
[1:29:49] didn't see the significance of Jesus's
[1:29:51] Ministry but God did
[1:29:58] Satan is trying to defeat Us in every
[1:30:01] every aspect church it's almost home
[1:30:05] time and he's doing everything to try to
[1:30:08] stop us from coming into our purpose in
[1:30:12] Christ
[1:30:15] amen trying to get us discouraged to
[1:30:17] where we get out of our position he did
[1:30:19] it to
[1:30:20] Moses you say Amen look
[1:30:24] Moses met with
[1:30:26] God in the back of a mountain out in the
[1:30:29] desert God specifically told him what he
[1:30:32] was going called to do take my people
[1:30:35] you're the one that I've called to lead
[1:30:37] my people out of Egypt go to the
[1:30:39] promised land he had specific
[1:30:42] commission but when he got out of Egypt
[1:30:45] and bringing that people he got to the
[1:30:48] Red
[1:30:49] Sea and Satan thought he had Moses
[1:30:53] whipped
[1:30:54] Moses forgot about the commission he
[1:30:56] forgot about what God called him to do
[1:30:58] and he began to cry un God but God never
[1:31:02] looked at him and said well Moses it was
[1:31:03] my mistake I chose you no he told Moses
[1:31:08] why are you crying unto
[1:31:11] me I called you I told you what I've
[1:31:14] called you to do just be steadfast in
[1:31:20] it don't leave don't walk away
[1:31:24] don't falter don't let the enemy cause
[1:31:27] you to just to
[1:31:29] wilt I've called you Moses I put you
[1:31:33] there I'm enabling
[1:31:36] you ain't changed my
[1:31:40] mind
[1:31:42] amen can you say
[1:31:44] Amen it wasn't Moses now telling themy
[1:31:47] it was the enemy say I got you
[1:31:50] now Moses may have not felt the
[1:31:52] anointing he may have not felt that
[1:31:54] emotional rush in
[1:31:55] church he may have not felt like running
[1:31:58] around glorifying God and
[1:32:02] whoopee it didn't mean he wasn't
[1:32:05] called didn't mean he wasn't
[1:32:08] anointed he just had to stay
[1:32:11] there
[1:32:13] true can you say
[1:32:15] Amen so the devil thought that he had
[1:32:18] Moses
[1:32:19] defeated but the but but the Lord spoke
[1:32:22] to Moses in Exodus 14:15 saying
[1:32:25] wherefore cist thou unto me speak unto
[1:32:28] the children of Israel that they go
[1:32:30] forward sometimes you you may not have a
[1:32:33] lot to say to people maybe you're going
[1:32:36] through a lot of things and maybe
[1:32:38] they're going through a lot of things
[1:32:40] and and and and you just don't know what
[1:32:42] to
[1:32:44] say but all you know is you got to come
[1:32:47] back to the word god called
[1:32:49] us God ordained us you got to stay fast
[1:32:54] with that word he said he would never
[1:32:56] leave us nor forsake us that he would be
[1:32:59] with us till the end of the
[1:33:01] world no doubt Moses began to talk to
[1:33:05] the people I don't understand what's
[1:33:07] going on I know it looks like we're
[1:33:09] about to fail it looks like the enemy's
[1:33:11] about to defeat us but I'm telling you
[1:33:13] God called us to come
[1:33:15] out look where he brought us this far
[1:33:19] look what he's
[1:33:21] done God is with us
[1:33:24] right
[1:33:28] right so speak unto the children of
[1:33:31] Israel that they go forward but lift
[1:33:33] thou up thy rod and stretch forth out
[1:33:36] thine hand over the sea and divide it
[1:33:38] and the children of Israel shall go and
[1:33:40] dry land through the midst of the
[1:33:43] sea you see God never called Moses to be
[1:33:46] defeated and he never called us to be
[1:33:49] defeated I say this he never called me
[1:33:52] to be defeated I don't care what the
[1:33:54] devil says I don't care what he breathes
[1:33:56] I don't I don't care the poisonous
[1:33:57] breath that he tries to breathe God
[1:33:59] never called Shawn Martin to be defeated
[1:34:02] and it didn't call you to be defeated he
[1:34:04] didn't call this church to be
[1:34:06] defeated can you say
[1:34:08] amen he didn't he didn't send Moses to
[1:34:11] do something then only for Moses to get
[1:34:13] sidetracked with what the enemy's
[1:34:16] doing what if Moses trying to lead but
[1:34:18] he's always wondering about what
[1:34:19] everybody else is doing and wherever the
[1:34:21] enemy is no he had to stay fast
[1:34:23] steadfast in what God called him to
[1:34:26] do just stay steadfast stay unmovable in
[1:34:31] the work of God can you say Amen don't
[1:34:33] forget the
[1:34:37] commission he called Moses to be
[1:34:41] successful praise the lord lord can you
[1:34:44] say amen amen why if Moses just threw up
[1:34:46] his hands and quit I give up I'm tired
[1:34:48] of this tired of the
[1:34:50] grumbling tired of the constant
[1:34:52] challenges
[1:34:54] just seem like everything just goes
[1:34:55] wrong every day I'm just tired of it I
[1:34:57] want to go somewhere else just I'll go
[1:35:00] to cazoo wherever that's
[1:35:07] at but one thing we see in Moses's life
[1:35:10] even through all of his mistakes is he
[1:35:11] was
[1:35:14] steadfast he remained steadfast IM
[1:35:17] movable Lord can you say Amen there was
[1:35:21] a Joshua and Caleb
[1:35:23] that made that that stayed steadfast
[1:35:25] with
[1:35:26] him can you say Amen I'm so glad that
[1:35:29] God brought him a prophet our way but I
[1:35:31] am more glad than ever that he stayed
[1:35:33] steadfast to the commission that God had
[1:35:35] given him every challenge he faced he
[1:35:38] stayed steadfast he showed us how to
[1:35:40] stay steadfast he believed in the
[1:35:42] commission that God gave him he truly
[1:35:44] believed in the mission that God had
[1:35:47] given him the commission can you say
[1:35:49] amen and because he believed in it he
[1:35:51] stood steadfast and I believe the same
[1:35:54] message I believe that we have been
[1:35:55] commissioned by the message by God and
[1:35:58] we must believe in that and stay
[1:36:01] steadfast we're going
[1:36:05] home I don't know how many more days
[1:36:07] we've got to live but stay
[1:36:11] steadfast could you imagine the very
[1:36:14] last hour of breath that we had and then
[1:36:16] we give
[1:36:18] up I don't want to be that
[1:36:21] way stay steadfast brother Bill
[1:36:27] the older I get then I realize I ain't
[1:36:29] got much time left I don't know even if
[1:36:31] I had 40 years 50 years that ain't much
[1:36:34] time I want to do everything that counts
[1:36:37] for God I want to be counted worthy of
[1:36:40] God I want to be counted
[1:36:42] faithful that when when I hear well done
[1:36:45] thou good and faithful well God ain't
[1:36:46] lying about
[1:36:48] me he ain't having to make up something
[1:36:51] he truly seen my life and saw me
[1:36:53] steadfast through all my ups and downs
[1:36:56] and my blunders and my failures and all
[1:36:58] of that I'm still remaining steadfast
[1:37:00] through the gospel and God wants to see
[1:37:03] you steadfast in the work that God has
[1:37:05] called you to
[1:37:07] do the glory is not here the glory is
[1:37:10] over there your rewards not here even
[1:37:13] though we we have a lot of we we we have
[1:37:15] blessings that God blesses us with and
[1:37:18] and and through our journey of life but
[1:37:19] the real we roar is not here it's over
[1:37:22] there can you amen that's right see so
[1:37:26] so God never called see and and and
[1:37:30] Moses knew the
[1:37:32] commission it amazes me how many people
[1:37:35] really don't know if God has sent
[1:37:38] them you know and so it's it's like they
[1:37:41] are the ones who decided what they're
[1:37:44] going to do for God they're the ones
[1:37:46] that decided to serve God they're the
[1:37:49] ones that's decided uh to come into the
[1:37:52] message
[1:37:53] they're the ones that's decided you
[1:37:56] understand what I'm saying and and then
[1:37:58] when the going gets rough then they're
[1:38:00] the ones that decides to quit and they
[1:38:02] are the ones that decides to abort and
[1:38:04] they are the ones that decides to give
[1:38:06] up on God and and all of these things
[1:38:09] you understand what I'm saying see and
[1:38:10] and it's because they have no vision uh
[1:38:13] uh as to their purpose in life that they
[1:38:16] have no vision as to what God has called
[1:38:19] you didn't stumble into this
[1:38:21] message God called you to this
[1:38:26] message I didn't stumble into being a
[1:38:29] preacher God called me to be a
[1:38:33] preacher God called you to be whatever
[1:38:35] God he called you to do it's not your
[1:38:42] choice don't lose the vision can you say
[1:38:46] Amen you see so they become
[1:38:50] fickle because they don't know their
[1:38:53] purpose purp it's it's though they think
[1:38:55] they're the ones that brought it they're
[1:38:57] the ones that believe they're the ones
[1:38:59] that
[1:39:02] decided and they become fickle because
[1:39:05] when the trials are there then they
[1:39:07] wither when the going is good then they
[1:39:10] come back and it's just back and
[1:39:13] forth and you cannot trust them with
[1:39:15] anything because they just may pick up
[1:39:17] and go on to something bigger and better
[1:39:20] anytime
[1:39:24] but God has called faithfulness God has
[1:39:26] called us to be
[1:39:29] steadfast you understand Church you you
[1:39:31] understand that God's called us and and
[1:39:34] and I know we get weary some sometimes
[1:39:36] it's a challenge it's a
[1:39:39] battle but we know we're children of God
[1:39:42] we know that we are the last
[1:39:44] age we know that we are a people that
[1:39:48] God has called out of a people
[1:39:53] we understand his purpose is
[1:39:56] calling God is not going to have a bride
[1:39:59] at the end of the age that is so ate up
[1:40:00] with bitterness and anguish
[1:40:03] and so us knowing
[1:40:06] that we're as I said Sunday we're we're
[1:40:09] in a we're in an age where there's no
[1:40:11] love brother brah said there's only love
[1:40:14] come to the place that only love will be
[1:40:15] found in the elect but that doesn't mean
[1:40:18] that it's a it's just something glorious
[1:40:20] and we're just like oh I'm so full of
[1:40:24] bitterness fights you just as much as it
[1:40:26] fights everybody else the thing is is
[1:40:29] you understand that no bitterness has a
[1:40:31] place in your heart you got to stay
[1:40:35] steadfast so you're continually fighting
[1:40:38] that thing you're fighting that
[1:40:40] unbelieving spirit because there ain't
[1:40:42] going to be a bride that's got unbelief
[1:40:44] in her you understand what I'm saying
[1:40:47] you you under you then we understand
[1:40:49] God's purpose therefore we're being
[1:40:51] steadfast in what God's purpose is
[1:40:54] is when that unbelieving Spirit tries to
[1:40:56] come in and we start trying to question
[1:40:58] the prophet all that we're steadfast to
[1:41:00] say
[1:41:01] no that's not what I'm called for amen
[1:41:04] you've taken the World by by storm but
[1:41:07] you ain't taking me by
[1:41:09] storm I'm steadfast in what God has
[1:41:11] called me to be I'm a son and daughter
[1:41:13] of God I'm his bride I'm The Virtuous
[1:41:17] spotless bride of Jesus
[1:41:19] Christ can you say
[1:41:21] Amen see so then therefore and I'll
[1:41:25] close but the only way for a man to be
[1:41:27] steadfast and immovable is for him to
[1:41:29] receive a revelation from
[1:41:32] God as to
[1:41:35] what he is to do what God is purpose for
[1:41:40] him that must come as a revelation
[1:41:42] because did not Jesus say it would be
[1:41:44] only by Revelation that the Gates of
[1:41:46] Hell cannot Prevail against only
[1:41:50] Revelation is the only thing revelation
[1:41:53] is the only thing that the devil will
[1:41:54] not be able to Prevail
[1:41:56] against he can Prevail against gifts he
[1:42:00] can Prevail against any
[1:42:01] Ministry but when it comes to Revelation
[1:42:04] he cannot Prevail the Lord can you say
[1:42:07] amen amen so therefore what that means
[1:42:10] is that we cannot be caught in between
[1:42:12] two
[1:42:14] opinions and then remain
[1:42:17] steadfast yes Revelation takes all other
[1:42:21] opinions away all right
[1:42:23] amen hello cuz then you're anchored you
[1:42:27] you know beyond a shout of a doubt
[1:42:29] that's why you need to have Revelation
[1:42:31] it every every son and daughter of God
[1:42:34] must have revelation of God by God that
[1:42:37] they're a son and daughter of
[1:42:39] God I'm not a son because my my preacher
[1:42:43] told me I'm a son I'm not a son because
[1:42:45] the prophet told me I'm a son I'm a son
[1:42:47] because God revealed it to me that I am
[1:42:50] his son
[1:42:53] am
[1:42:55] hello so brother Brandon would say you
[1:42:58] need Revelation when it comes to your
[1:43:00] healing you need
[1:43:02] Revelation when it comes to your
[1:43:04] salvation you need Revelation it it
[1:43:06] takes Revelation brother Bram says this
[1:43:09] I think about healing he said if you can
[1:43:11] ever get yourself shook away from
[1:43:13] everything else right down to the word
[1:43:17] there you can build steadfast unmovable
[1:43:21] always abounding in the works of the
[1:43:23] Lord not tossed about from here and
[1:43:25] there trying every prayer line running
[1:43:27] up and down the streets this one and
[1:43:30] that one you'll be stable you'll say
[1:43:32] Lord I believe it because you said so
[1:43:34] and that settles it all demons out of
[1:43:37] Torment couldn't shake you away from it
[1:43:40] you know it see when God has once
[1:43:44] revealed it spiritually placed it in
[1:43:46] your heart that Jesus Christ died at
[1:43:48] Calvary to heal you you are well then
[1:43:52] all right because it's become a
[1:43:54] revelation then Satan can't take that
[1:43:56] away from you your symptoms no matter
[1:43:58] how bad you
[1:44:00] get there's a revelation says I'm
[1:44:04] well well that's the way with salvation
[1:44:06] it has to be a revelation you have the
[1:44:08] Holy Ghost that has to be a revelation
[1:44:10] to you you say well I got the Holy Ghost
[1:44:12] well how do you know that well cuz I
[1:44:14] cried I got excited now the Pentecostal
[1:44:17] way was I I I spoke in tongues I run all
[1:44:20] over the building I felt good well
[1:44:22] brothers and sisters there's going to be
[1:44:23] times that you don't feel good you're
[1:44:26] not going to run all over the building
[1:44:27] every
[1:44:28] service you understand what I'm saying
[1:44:31] so that Revelation has to be
[1:44:34] there then you become steadfast
[1:44:38] that's well so it is in the revelation
[1:44:41] of what God has for you so he says see
[1:44:45] when God has once revealed it
[1:44:46] spiritually placed it in your heart that
[1:44:49] Jesus Christ died at Calvary to heal you
[1:44:51] you're well amen no need of coming
[1:44:54] through any prayer line then you're well
[1:44:56] just like if every one every one time by
[1:45:00] the working of Holy Spirit God reveals
[1:45:02] to you that Jesus died in your stead and
[1:45:04] it's him Knocking at Your Heart
[1:45:06] Something's Happened down here in that
[1:45:07] little heart it's over right God give us
[1:45:12] Revelation amen can you say
[1:45:16] Amen now being that we're the last age
[1:45:20] we have great responsibility Weighing on
[1:45:22] our shoulders
[1:45:25] because all the Believers who have lived
[1:45:27] their life before us in the previous
[1:45:30] ages they're waiting on us to finish the
[1:45:35] race you believe it it's like it's like
[1:45:38] the relay
[1:45:41] race brother Branson you probably know
[1:45:43] more about it about the the the running
[1:45:46] the
[1:45:47] race but they you know one the race
[1:45:51] starts and one runs he's got a stick in
[1:45:54] his hand Paton I guess and he runs
[1:45:57] around
[1:45:58] there and he comes to that he come back
[1:46:01] to the point where he started I I
[1:46:03] believe but then he passes that he
[1:46:05] didn't win the race he passed it to
[1:46:07] another that baton to another Runner
[1:46:09] then that Runner takes off and he comes
[1:46:12] back and he passes it on to another and
[1:46:14] they keep passing it on I don't know how
[1:46:16] to how many but in this
[1:46:19] case there was seven runners
[1:46:23] that would run seven Church age
[1:46:25] Messengers that that would
[1:46:28] run and it's the last
[1:46:31] guy that has to be the
[1:46:34] strongest he has to be the
[1:46:37] best because all the responsibility now
[1:46:40] weighs upon his shoulders and everyone
[1:46:44] that ran in front of him is now resting
[1:46:46] in him and what he can do you
[1:46:51] understand if he can make it it they've
[1:46:53] made
[1:46:54] it and when he wins they
[1:46:57] win and Paul says they without us cannot
[1:47:01] be made perfect that's true every one of
[1:47:04] them that has run their race are now
[1:47:06] looking at us to win
[1:47:08] ours we're the last group we're the last
[1:47:13] ones therefore you must be steadfast in
[1:47:16] movable don't let Spirit of Deception
[1:47:19] come in discouragement come in don't let
[1:47:21] It Rock Your Boat don't let it make you
[1:47:24] shift and and start looking around at
[1:47:26] other ways and other places and other
[1:47:28] things you stay steadfast in the work of
[1:47:32] God for we as the prophet said we are
[1:47:35] the people who under our messenger are
[1:47:37] the final voice to the final
[1:47:40] age there will be no other people after
[1:47:44] us can you say Amen brother Bram said we
[1:47:47] are living in the rapturing age the
[1:47:49] Rapture age he says we are at the
[1:47:51] closing scene of the world's activities
[1:47:54] and fixing to enter into that great age
[1:47:56] that we've all looked for so long the
[1:47:59] Hebrew prophets have spoke of through
[1:48:01] the day can you say Amen another place
[1:48:03] he said it's the ending of time and the
[1:48:05] blending in of Eternity and church we
[1:48:08] don't have much time left you understand
[1:48:12] I know it it you know sometimes you just
[1:48:15] want to give up what's the use and all
[1:48:17] these things but you can't give
[1:48:21] up brother abah said it's the greatest
[1:48:23] sinful age it's more sin in this age
[1:48:26] than there's ever been and the powers of
[1:48:29] Satan is many times harder to fight
[1:48:31] against than it was in any other age so
[1:48:34] what it means is this is not a
[1:48:39] cakewalk amen I looked up that word
[1:48:42] Cakewalk you know what the world
[1:48:46] Cakewalk it means it's not an easy
[1:48:49] task it's not going to be an easy
[1:48:51] victory
[1:48:54] can you say Amen in Matthew 11:12 Jesus
[1:48:57] said the Kingdom of Heaven suffer
[1:48:59] violence and the violent take it by
[1:49:02] force so you're not going to Coast into
[1:49:05] Victory you're going to take it can you
[1:49:08] say
[1:49:09] Amen if
[1:49:12] the musicians will
[1:49:15] come we will not fulfill God's purpose
[1:49:19] by playing
[1:49:20] around therefore you cannot not let this
[1:49:24] layot of spirit get upon you to where
[1:49:27] you just become satisfied with just a
[1:49:29] little church service satisfied with
[1:49:32] just a little
[1:49:35] thing may may we be so earnestly
[1:49:40] steadfast and immovable knowing our
[1:49:43] purpose God never called us to be weak
[1:49:45] God never called us to be just just
[1:49:48] halfway doing things church if we can't
[1:49:52] overcome the things of the world how we
[1:49:54] what are we
[1:49:56] doing if if we're being so more enticed
[1:49:59] into the the pleasures of life than we
[1:50:01] are into the things of God something
[1:50:03] wrong you understand what I'm saying but
[1:50:06] we're the ones that's called to defeat
[1:50:08] the Devil in every aspect in every way
[1:50:10] in everything you can overcome that
[1:50:13] pornography you can overcome that temper
[1:50:15] you can overcome the bitterness you can
[1:50:18] overcome all of these things be
[1:50:20] steadfast and unmovable
[1:50:23] always abounding in the work of the
[1:50:25] Lord can you say amen amen that's
[1:50:30] right brother Braham said The Heirs of
[1:50:32] Promise Abraham Isaac and Jacob and many
[1:50:34] others they're looking forward to us not
[1:50:37] to fail for without us they cannot be
[1:50:40] made perfect they are depending on us
[1:50:44] let's not
[1:50:48] fail can you say Amen let's not fail
[1:50:53] don't get so wrapped up in all this
[1:50:54] worldly things let's not fail we got a
[1:50:59] commission don't get so carnal don't go
[1:51:02] get so wrapped up that you you you lose
[1:51:04] sight of prayer you lose sight of the
[1:51:06] things of God where your Ambitions are
[1:51:09] more on the world than it is of god can
[1:51:12] you say
[1:51:13] Amen oh I love the Lord do you love him
[1:51:17] I love him we could go on and on but be
