[35:48] complete control of the services our
[35:51] prayer in Jesus Christ's name we ask it
[35:55] amen
[35:57] the uh Revelations the third chapter
[36:01] and we're going to start at the first
[36:03] verse
[36:06] and unto the angel of the church in
[36:08] Sardis write these things saith he that
[36:12] hath the seven spirits of God and the
[36:14] Seven Stars
[36:15] I Know Thy works that thou Hast a name
[36:18] that thou livest and are dead Be
[36:22] watchful and strengthen the things which
[36:24] remain that are ready to die
[36:27] for I have not found thy works perfect
[36:29] before God remember therefore how thou
[36:33] Hast received and heard
[36:36] and hold fast and repent
[36:38] if therefore Thou shalt not watch I will
[36:41] come on thee as a thief and thou shalt
[36:44] not know what hour I will come upon thee
[36:47] thou Hast a few names even in Sardis
[36:50] which have not defiled their garments
[36:54] and they shall walk with me in white for
[36:58] they are worthy
[37:00] he that overcometh the same shall be
[37:02] clothed in white raiment and I will not
[37:05] blot out his name
[37:08] out of The Book of Life
[37:10] that I will confess his name before my
[37:13] father
[37:14] and before his angels amen
[37:17] you can have your seats this evening
[37:21] and tonight I I want to deal with the
[37:25] overcomer
[37:27] uh that my title though is names that
[37:30] cannot be blotted out
[37:32] and but I'm going to deal
[37:36] with the Overcomer especially in this
[37:39] day
[37:40] and the reason
[37:42] um
[37:44] I read this scripture
[37:46] even though it is addressed to the
[37:49] Sardis Church age
[37:51] uh it also brother Branham says that the
[37:55] rewards that are given to every each
[37:58] Overcomer in each age belongs to us
[38:02] so we don't look at it as well this was
[38:06] given to that age but that it it applies
[38:10] uh to the Overcomer in this laodicean
[38:13] age
[38:14] now I'm just going to look at the the
[38:19] the
[38:20] promises uh that that was given in each
[38:23] age uh first the first church age
[38:26] Revelations uh there uh 2 7 I believe
[38:32] it says he that hath an ear let him hear
[38:34] what the spirit saith unto the churches
[38:36] to him that overcometh
[38:39] will I give to eat of the tree of life
[38:41] which is in the midst of the paradise of
[38:44] God
[38:45] the second Church age in the 11th
[38:47] chapter he that overcometh shall not be
[38:50] heard of the second death
[38:52] the Third Church age in the 17th verse
[38:55] to him that overcometh I will give to
[38:58] eat of the Hidden Manna and will give
[39:00] him a white stone and in this Stone a
[39:03] new name written which no man knoweth
[39:06] saving he that receives it the fourth
[39:09] Church age in the 26th verse he that
[39:12] overcometh and keepeth my words unto the
[39:15] end to him will I give the power over
[39:18] the Nations and shall he shall rule them
[39:22] with a rod of iron and as a vessel of a
[39:25] Potter shall they be broken into Shivers
[39:29] even as I received of my father
[39:32] than the fifth Church age uh
[39:35] uh chapter three and five he that
[39:38] overcometh the same shall be clothed in
[39:40] white raiment and I will not uh blot out
[39:44] his name out of the book of life but I
[39:46] will confess his name before my father
[39:48] and the Holy Angels the sixth Church age
[39:51] 312 he him that overcometh will I make a
[39:56] pillar in the temple of my God and he
[39:58] shall go out no more
[40:01] um
[40:02] and I will write upon him my name the
[40:05] name of my God and the name of the city
[40:09] of my God which is the New Jerusalem
[40:12] which cometh down from heaven Out of
[40:15] Heaven from God and I will write upon
[40:18] him my new name the seventh Church age
[40:21] 21st verse to him that overcometh will I
[40:24] grant to sit with me in my throne even
[40:28] as I also overcome and am set down with
[40:32] my father in his throne he that hath an
[40:35] ear and and every every time he
[40:39] addresses at the end of the age and
[40:41] dressed the Overcomer he that hath in
[40:43] here let him hear what the spirit said
[40:47] to the churches ain't that right so the
[40:50] Overcomer
[40:51] of this age against all the rewards and
[40:54] they're there there may have been just
[40:57] very few Overcomers which uh there has
[41:01] just been very very few Overcomers but
[41:04] yet nonetheless God has had Overcomers
[41:09] and so brother Graham said God has had
[41:12] Overcomers in every age and there's
[41:15] always everybody say always every time
[41:18] in every age that's that there's been on
[41:22] Earth God has always had somebody he
[41:26] could put his hands on as a witness in
[41:29] the earth he's never been without a
[41:31] witness so an overcomer is a witness a
[41:34] man it's that's what that's what he is
[41:36] though sometimes just one just one
[41:39] Overcomer just one witness but God's
[41:41] always had one and he said but somebody
[41:44] overcome now like the Saints of old
[41:48] ain't that right so again God's going to
[41:51] have an overcomer in this layout of CN
[41:53] age because he addresses that Overcomer
[41:57] it it may be very few amen and if it is
[42:00] very few it does not break scripture
[42:02] because there's always been just a few
[42:04] uh down of Overcomers down through the
[42:07] age amen but the Overcomer in this age I
[42:12] believe is important uh uh because the
[42:17] the Bible says they without us cannot be
[42:19] made perfect
[42:21] so all of the Overcomers at the other
[42:24] ages are looking to this age for
[42:27] Overcomer amen and and so just imagine
[42:31] that that we are the finale we God has
[42:34] saved the best for last amen God has
[42:38] saved the best for last in this age and
[42:41] and to know that he he knew you would
[42:44] make it in the the most difficult
[42:46] deceptive evil age uh yet he knew he
[42:51] knew that you could handle it ain't that
[42:53] right and uh not in your own self of
[42:56] course but so the the the the ones that
[43:00] overcome in the previous ages are
[43:03] depending on us uh uh to finish the the
[43:06] race a man that they've ran and here we
[43:09] are the Baton is in our hands and
[43:12] there's no other age to pass the Baton
[43:14] too this I guess that's what you'd call
[43:16] it the state the Baton whatever anyways
[43:19] it's it's uh you're the you're the
[43:21] finale and and so the Overcomer is the
[43:25] individual that breaks the mode of what
[43:29] is normal of of the routine the the
[43:32] Overcomer now you just think of that uh
[43:36] uh the world is Shifting in One
[43:38] Direction and we see that today uh
[43:41] everything is going in One Direction but
[43:44] the Overcomer uh is one that breaks that
[43:48] mold and breaks that routine and he he
[43:51] or she doesn't fit in with the world and
[43:55] neither do they tried to fit in with the
[43:58] world and and so they break uh uh uh the
[44:02] cycles of tradition they withstand the
[44:05] Overcomer withstands the evil spirit
[44:07] instead of being
[44:09] dominated by them they they're able to
[44:13] withstand them instead of being overcome
[44:16] and controlled by them they're able to
[44:19] withstand them and and throw them off
[44:22] can you say man or we will say as Jesus
[44:24] said cast them out ain't that right and
[44:27] and so we're looking at an age that
[44:29] people are literally going insane I uh
[44:33] you know and we were talking about that
[44:35] as was going home uh uh you know that
[44:38] that if a person wants to identify as a
[44:40] cat then then we just call them a cat
[44:43] and and and one lady says but but to do
[44:47] that she's talking to the school board
[44:48] to do that you are denying telling that
[44:52] child that there's no truth there's no
[44:54] facts there's there's nothing and you're
[44:56] you're just going by what your
[44:58] imagination tells you to do and that
[45:01] becomes truth to you but because just
[45:03] because you say it's true don't mean
[45:05] it's truth and and yet I was telling the
[45:08] family but this is where brother Branham
[45:10] said they are literally going insane to
[45:13] where they they'll they'll see what uh
[45:15] did the prophet say ants the the size uh
[45:19] uh Mountain High Mile High Ai and and
[45:22] Birds with wings as six city blocks long
[45:25] and and they'll see these things and
[45:27] it's all in their imagination and so
[45:30] they're already coming to these things
[45:32] you can't make a man you know you can't
[45:35] tell a man and say that he's a girl just
[45:38] because he says he's a girl a man it
[45:40] just ain't gonna work that way but but
[45:43] it's the insanity but yet the Overcomer
[45:46] is withstanding all of these spirits
[45:49] that are out there and and again it's
[45:52] not just it's not just the older uh
[45:55] generation uh but the young people uh uh
[45:59] middle-aged children uh uh whoever is
[46:03] the Overcomer they're withstanding the
[46:06] pressure there was standing the spirits
[46:09] there and it was standing they're not
[46:11] going to lose their mind like the world
[46:13] is they're not going insane like the
[46:15] world is they're not accepting lies like
[46:17] the world is and and even even the Bible
[46:20] says because they had a lot of love for
[46:22] the truth God would send them strong
[46:24] delusions if they had believed the lie
[46:26] and be damned and and and so all of
[46:29] these things are fulfillment of
[46:31] scripture but then there's that
[46:33] Overcomer a man that doesn't go that
[46:36] Direction She's he or she has got a
[46:39] different anointing she's a a different
[46:41] product ain't that right and so some
[46:45] teach that the church you know I just
[46:47] thinking of the Overcomers some teach
[46:48] that the church a man is is going to go
[46:51] through the tribulation that has to go
[46:53] through the tribulation uh in order to
[46:56] be purified but brother Brown says
[46:59] that's not true yes the church nominal
[47:02] the church natural yes they will have to
[47:05] go uh in uh in the tribulation uh for
[47:10] purification but not the bride of Christ
[47:12] now we know that the Sixth Seal is the
[47:16] the the uh tribulation seal and and
[47:19] there's one thing in that seal that you
[47:22] will not find amen and that is the bride
[47:25] of Christ amen the the the the Church of
[47:28] the Living God you'll not find uh uh
[47:31] them or or I'll say the Overcomer you'll
[47:35] not find them in that chapter in that in
[47:38] that seal amen because they're already
[47:41] gone into Glory ain't that right and and
[47:44] so uh uh brother Brown said that she has
[47:49] no need for purification uh Jesus says
[47:52] here in John 5 24 verily verily I say
[47:56] unto you he that heareth my word and
[47:59] believeth on him that sent me hath
[48:02] everlasting life and shall not come into
[48:05] condemnation but his past already passed
[48:09] from Death unto life ain't that right
[48:11] yes sir so Christ gave the promise that
[48:15] we would not have to stand in the
[48:18] Judgment amen I'm so glad for that I I
[48:22] don't know about you but that's that's a
[48:23] that's very comforting it's because that
[48:25] promise belongs to us it's it's not a
[48:28] it's not rubbing a rabbit's foot it's it
[48:30] it's not keeping the fingers crossed
[48:33] hopefully that that we're we're going to
[48:35] do this no it's a promise it's a
[48:37] security it's a it's a guarantee that
[48:40] the Overcomer will not go through the
[48:43] tribulation do you believe that amen yes
[48:46] sir see Christ freely took our place
[48:49] until we're absolutely free aren't you
[48:53] free amen Christ absolutely took our
[48:57] place that we're absolutely free now
[49:00] that's how we can overcome we're free
[49:02] how many is free tonight see we're free
[49:05] that's what makes us the Overcomer
[49:08] brother Brown said when I'm pardoned I'm
[49:10] pardoned how can he take me out of the
[49:13] pawn shop and got a clear receipt see so
[49:16] how can he be my redeemer take me from
[49:19] the pawn shop and the bro broker still
[49:21] say that I belong to him amen it can't
[49:24] happen you've got the receipt that
[49:26] you're you're paid for amen you're not
[49:29] acting like you're in bondage you're not
[49:31] sitting there with chains all around you
[49:33] amen you are free can you say man he
[49:37] that the sun is set free is free indeed
[49:41] ain't that right amen I you know if I
[49:44] can use that at this illustration you
[49:46] know we we sometimes we chain up our dog
[49:48] and and and you know he's uh or she
[49:51] she's you know uh well we've got five of
[49:54] them now Lord have mercy and and but we
[49:57] chain them up you know and and they want
[49:59] to go and and yet they're bound you know
[50:01] they can't go any further and finally
[50:03] they just sit there and lay down you
[50:04] know because they ain't going anywhere
[50:06] but the time that we set that dog free
[50:09] amen uh uh she doesn't still act bound I
[50:12] you know but she's she's running around
[50:14] everywhere she's happy she's free you
[50:17] know and I think well that's the same
[50:19] thing and I understand what brother man
[50:20] said about the crow a man how that Crow
[50:23] you know he had come to that certain
[50:24] spot a man then he got loose and and he
[50:27] would still come to that certain spot
[50:28] amen but I don't believe that the bride
[50:30] is there tonight amen I believe the
[50:33] bride is recognizing that she's free
[50:35] she's free she's free she's free she's
[50:38] free to believe she's free to to walk in
[50:41] the light she's free to Amen to accept
[50:44] what God has for her she's free can you
[50:47] say man well that's where the Overcomer
[50:50] is he the Overcomers understanding I am
[50:54] free amen from everything that the devil
[50:57] is has has tried to lay on me I'm free
[51:00] from his accusations I'm free from
[51:02] slavery I'm free from the sins I'm free
[51:06] my trap record is clean and I am free
[51:09] amen I believe that's the Overcomer a
[51:12] man realizing see amen he says now
[51:15] brother Brown says I've got a written
[51:16] receipt amen wrote by the blood of Jesus
[51:19] Christ and contact right so a minister
[51:22] asked brother Branham said how can you
[51:24] how can you say that the the bride uh is
[51:29] gone before the tribulation and brother
[51:32] Branham replied by giving him a
[51:34] scripture Matthew 27 51 uh uh and it
[51:38] says and behold the veil of the temple
[51:42] was written in Twain From the top to the
[51:46] bottom now brother Branham uh uh talking
[51:50] about that scripture says now that was
[51:52] the law that was the law and the veil
[51:55] had kept the congregation from being
[51:59] able to enter in amen uh uh uh into the
[52:04] holiest of holy the veil kept the
[52:06] congregation from the articles of God
[52:09] ain't that right a man uh kept him a man
[52:13] from there and only an anointed priest a
[52:16] man could enter in there uh uh once a
[52:20] year and that rhyme amen but the veil
[52:23] was rent from top to bottom showing that
[52:26] it was a supernatural act of God that
[52:29] that done and and now whosoever Will can
[52:34] enter into uh there and partake of his
[52:38] Holiness can you say amen amen how how
[52:41] else if it hadn't been for the blood of
[52:44] Jesus Christ how else couldn't we
[52:45] overcome amen if it had not been for
[52:48] that Veil being rimmed a man Beware Of
[52:51] The Mercy Seat would be exposed Amen to
[52:54] us amen and the atonement be applied
[52:57] amen how else can it happen ain't that
[52:59] right but the Bible says this that the
[53:02] Earth did quake and the Rocks were in
[53:05] and then what happened the graves were
[53:08] opened and many bodies of the Saints
[53:11] which slept a rose ain't that right and
[53:14] came out of the graves after his
[53:17] resurrection and went into the holy city
[53:20] and appeared unto many now the prophet
[53:23] said now that is the elected bride amen
[53:26] that's that elected group that's that
[53:28] Overcomer a man they had waited in the
[53:31] ground for all them years amen but they
[53:33] had a promise a man of a resurrection
[53:36] ain't that right now so so not all the
[53:39] of the Jewish church amen rose out of
[53:42] the ground at that time only the elected
[53:46] only the Overcomer ain't that right amen
[53:49] now the prophet said they all made the
[53:51] same sacrifice they all was under the
[53:54] same uh uh under the shed blood of the
[53:57] lamb but there was an elected group and
[54:01] that elected group as soon as the event
[54:04] come that really believed in it with
[54:07] sincerity can you say amen amen anything
[54:10] that God uh uh uh showed there was that
[54:14] Overcomer that really believed it With
[54:18] all sincerity these that had really
[54:22] overcome sincerely making the same
[54:25] sacrifice that the rest of them made but
[54:28] in sincerity can you say man I think
[54:31] sincerity has a lot to do amen with our
[54:34] Christian walk I think even brother even
[54:37] the angel of the Lord told Brother
[54:38] Branham you must be more sincere ain't
[54:41] that right if there's every any time or
[54:44] every uh something that we need to look
[54:46] into our lives and that is how sincere
[54:49] are we about this gospel that we're we
[54:52] claim to live amen how sincere amen is
[54:56] our worship how sincere is our belief
[54:59] how sincere is our faith amen do we come
[55:03] to the house of God just just uh uh you
[55:06] know just uh uh mediocre or are we
[55:08] sincere in what we're doing are we
[55:11] sincere in our prayer are we sincere
[55:14] when we read the Bible are we sincere
[55:16] when we say Amen you see these things as
[55:20] life and death to us can you say man
[55:22] we're not just treating this as just a
[55:25] happy-go-lucky thing we're not just
[55:27] treating this as just a well you know
[55:29] okay it fits my schedule so I'll go I'll
[55:31] do this I'll do that but no that
[55:34] Overcomer is sincere ain't that right so
[55:38] sincerely making the same sacrifice that
[55:41] the rest of them made but in sincerity
[55:44] they overcame the things of the world so
[55:49] the prophet said when the propitiation
[55:52] correctly was made for them they were in
[55:55] Paradise until that time and when that
[55:59] time was made they had overcome and was
[56:03] resting
[56:05] oh my amen resting sleeping and many
[56:09] bodies of those that slept in the dust
[56:12] see amen slept they arose ain't that
[56:15] right well the prophet tells us about
[56:17] Daniel in the Old Testament how that he
[56:20] was an overcomer amen he was stood in
[56:23] that day yeah uh uh uh the the the evil
[56:27] in his day he withstood the laws of the
[56:31] land in his day you and you you all know
[56:34] the story that of Daniel and the things
[56:36] that he had to go through life wasn't
[56:38] easy for him amen he had to stand alone
[56:41] there was actually the prophet said only
[56:43] four Overcomers in Daniel's day and that
[56:45] was Daniel Shadrach Meshach and Abednego
[56:47] ain't that right only four out of a
[56:50] whole nation of Jews and you think well
[56:53] where why why ain't they doing it amen
[56:55] why why ain't they amen living a life it
[56:58] wasn't meant for them amen they were the
[57:00] ones that was the Overcomers in their
[57:03] day but that Overcomer held a promise
[57:05] him and God told uh uh Daniel there in
[57:10] Daniel 12 13 said to him go thy way till
[57:14] the end be for Thou shalt rest and stand
[57:17] in thy lot at the end of the days when
[57:20] the print shall come which will stand
[57:23] for the people Thou shalt stand in thy
[57:28] lot amen there so brother Brown said
[57:31] here it is Daniel this prophet of God
[57:34] saw the end time coming and he said
[57:36] Daniel you'll stand in your lot at that
[57:39] day amen I'm so glad there's a position
[57:42] for us every Overcomer God doesn't
[57:45] Forget You amen but there is a position
[57:47] there is a place for you can you say
[57:50] amen that's right see and he said Daniel
[57:53] you'll stand in your lot at that day and
[57:55] here he was come forth out of that
[57:58] Resurrection not all of Israel but the
[58:02] bright type of Israel ain't that right
[58:04] he says now the rest of Israel don't
[58:06] come forth until the general
[58:08] Resurrection amen so the Overcomer is
[58:12] the one that came up uh in that
[58:15] Resurrection out of the ground see so
[58:18] the Overcomer is is a special
[58:22] individual amen watch what's going to
[58:25] happen in this age First Corinthians 15
[58:28] 51 behold I show you a mystery we shall
[58:31] not all sleep but we all shall be
[58:34] changed then you say man there's a place
[58:37] for you amen keep overcoming there's a
[58:41] promise for you ain't that right first
[58:43] Thessalonians 4 16 for the Lord himself
[58:46] shall descend from heaven with the Shout
[58:48] with the voice of the Archangel with the
[58:50] Trump of God and the dead in Christ
[58:53] shall rise first then we which we which
[58:56] are alive and remain shall be caught up
[59:00] together with them in the clouds to meet
[59:02] the Lord in the air and so shall we ever
[59:05] be with the Lord amen then 20
[59:09] Revelations 20 and 5 but the rest of the
[59:12] Dead not the Overcomer but the rest of
[59:15] the Dead live not again until the
[59:17] thousand years were finished can you say
[59:20] amen amen so there is a separation God
[59:23] puts the separation between the rest and
[59:27] the Overcomer ain't that right and every
[59:29] promise a man that God gives to the
[59:32] church he gives to the Overcomer because
[59:34] the Overcomer is the one that makes up
[59:37] the bride of Christ do you believe that
[59:40] a man say so uh uh we find brother Brown
[59:43] said at the coming of the Lord Jesus
[59:46] those who really loving or really loving
[59:49] is coming that's living for it when he
[59:52] appears in the sky the church that's
[59:55] dead in Christ shall rise and those will
[59:58] be changed in a moment and the rest of
[1:00:01] them will know nothing about it can you
[1:00:04] say amen amen think of that now at the
[1:00:06] coming of the Lord Jesus which we know
[1:00:09] where where we're at today and where we
[1:00:11] stand those who are really loving not
[1:00:15] lovers of pleasure
[1:00:17] not lovers of self but those who are
[1:00:20] really loving his coming can you say man
[1:00:22] that's living for it when he appears in
[1:00:26] the sky amen the church that's dead in
[1:00:29] Christ shall rise and those will uh be
[1:00:32] changed and the rest of them will know
[1:00:34] nothing about it amen now remember the
[1:00:37] they're in the scripture that we read in
[1:00:39] the New Testament that those Saints Rose
[1:00:41] and appeared uh uh to those in the city
[1:00:45] and brother Brown said the Rapture will
[1:00:48] be like that we'll see each other we'll
[1:00:50] see them amen the rest of the world
[1:00:53] won't see them who are we going to see
[1:00:55] those that have overcome that went into
[1:00:58] the ground amen when they rise first we
[1:01:02] are going to see them those Overcomers
[1:01:05] that state remain and are still
[1:01:07] overcoming and has not gone by the way
[1:01:10] of the Grave they're going to see them
[1:01:12] can you say man and the world will not
[1:01:15] see them they will know nothing about it
[1:01:17] amen but they're all my I'm waiting for
[1:01:20] that time are you waiting for that time
[1:01:23] yes sir he says see the rest of the
[1:01:26] world won't see them it'll be caught
[1:01:28] away as a secret going waiting for that
[1:01:31] time then returning back to the Earth
[1:01:34] for that glorious Millennium then the
[1:01:37] Thousand Years and the rest of the Dead
[1:01:39] live not for a thousand years and then
[1:01:41] come forth the general Resurrection
[1:01:43] where all Israel so he says look you
[1:01:45] there the 12 apostles the twelve break
[1:01:47] your hearts all represented and we ain't
[1:01:49] never uh he's got yet to that so so we
[1:01:53] find a man that that we're in the hour
[1:01:56] of this to happen that the dead in
[1:01:59] Christ I I I it could happen now it
[1:02:02] could be just any moment amen where the
[1:02:04] dead in Christ will rise first and begin
[1:02:07] to appear Amen to us that are overcoming
[1:02:10] in this age can you say Amen so blessed
[1:02:14] is he blessed is that man that overcomes
[1:02:18] in this last stage we see that that this
[1:02:22] is the age that they they put Christ out
[1:02:25] of his own church amen Revelations 3 20.
[1:02:29] Jesus says behold I stand at the door
[1:02:32] and knock and if any man hear my voice
[1:02:35] and open the door I will come into him
[1:02:38] and will sup with him and he with me
[1:02:41] ain't that right so he's standing out of
[1:02:44] his own outside of his own church trying
[1:02:46] to get back in brother Brown said that's
[1:02:49] the most horrific picture it's a sad
[1:02:51] picture it's a it's it's it's terrible
[1:02:53] scene that Christ would be outside of
[1:02:57] his own church but if you notice he's
[1:03:00] calling to the Overcomer ain't that
[1:03:03] right amen yes sir all's not lost he's
[1:03:07] calling to that Overcomer amen and we've
[1:03:09] heard that voice amen come out of her my
[1:03:12] people amen who's he calling to the
[1:03:15] Overcomer come out of her amen I want
[1:03:17] want to sup with you I I wanna I wanna
[1:03:19] know you I want to commune with you I I
[1:03:22] want to share my power with you I can
[1:03:24] you say man amen so what does the
[1:03:27] Overcomer do amen he begins to come out
[1:03:30] amen because he's an overcomer and it's
[1:03:33] always at the end of the age that he
[1:03:36] speaks to the Overcomer he that
[1:03:38] overcomes now the prophet said his call
[1:03:41] is not to the church as a whole but it's
[1:03:46] to the individual he not she he she
[1:03:50] represents woman ain't that right and
[1:03:52] the church is the type of the woman but
[1:03:55] now he's calling for the Overcomer or
[1:03:58] the individual so it's showing that it's
[1:04:01] not a church thing it's not a group
[1:04:03] thing it's not a people thing it's an
[1:04:06] individual walk it's an individual thing
[1:04:09] can you say Amen whether Mom goes I'm
[1:04:12] gonna go whether dad and mom goes or if
[1:04:15] friends stay behind he's called me to go
[1:04:17] can you say amen amen there's a lot of
[1:04:20] times that we want to get involved with
[1:04:21] the with with group things ain't that
[1:04:23] right amen identify as a group but God
[1:04:27] is calling us to identify with his word
[1:04:29] as an individual amen I'm going to
[1:04:32] believe it sink or swim whether anybody
[1:04:34] believes it or not I'm still going to
[1:04:36] believe because I've heard the call amen
[1:04:38] coming to me ain't that right amen so
[1:04:41] the prophet said if it was to the church
[1:04:44] he would have said she that overcomes
[1:04:46] but it's he the individual that
[1:04:49] overcomes a man see the individual and
[1:04:53] the Overcomer that individual is the one
[1:04:57] who conquers now I you know uh uh people
[1:05:01] call it self-righteous people can call
[1:05:03] it whatever they want to amen but but
[1:05:05] see that Overcomer if he's going to
[1:05:08] overcome then he cannot have a passive
[1:05:11] Spirit about him amen if she's going to
[1:05:13] overcome she can't just have this easy
[1:05:16] go lucky uh attitude about life amen
[1:05:20] she's got to be he's got to be that
[1:05:21] individual's got to be a warrior at
[1:05:24] heart can you say amen amen to where I'm
[1:05:27] going to believe this whether people
[1:05:29] believe it or not I'm going to stand
[1:05:30] true to this amen if y'all wanna y'all
[1:05:33] just do what you want to but I'm staying
[1:05:35] right here amen No One's Gonna talk me
[1:05:37] out of it I'm gonna stay amen because
[1:05:40] I'm an overcomer a man the Overcomer is
[1:05:43] one who conquers and in speaking about
[1:05:45] faith being the victory that overcomes
[1:05:47] the world uh brother Branham said
[1:05:49] conquer and victory is the same to
[1:05:52] conquer it means to beat down to
[1:05:55] override to handcuff to throw into
[1:05:58] prisons so you you understand in your
[1:06:01] life what are you doing
[1:06:03] can you say man amen I have his
[1:06:06] Overcomers here amen so this is what's
[1:06:09] reflecting your testimony it's
[1:06:11] reflecting your actions it's reflecting
[1:06:13] your statement uh your character your
[1:06:15] nature everything about you a man to
[1:06:18] conquer if you're that Overcomer if I'm
[1:06:20] the Overcomer a man that I am I am
[1:06:23] conquering which means to beat down to
[1:06:25] override to handcuff to throw into
[1:06:28] prisons I'm not here to Amen to to
[1:06:31] wallow in the muck in the mire I'm here
[1:06:33] to bring that thing into captivity I am
[1:06:36] not here to listen to negative thoughts
[1:06:38] I I'm bringing every thought under
[1:06:40] subjection to the word of God for I am
[1:06:43] an overcomer I'm not being influenced by
[1:06:46] just everybody amen the word is my
[1:06:49] influence the promises are my influence
[1:06:52] my faith is not based upon what I see
[1:06:54] what I hear what I feel my faith is
[1:06:57] based upon the word of the Living God
[1:06:59] ain't that right so we're bringing
[1:07:02] ourselves under uh uh in line with the
[1:07:05] word we're bringing this body we're
[1:07:06] bringing our testimony we're bringing
[1:07:08] everything in subjection to the word of
[1:07:11] God now brother Brown said to conquer it
[1:07:14] means that sin the sin that once ruled
[1:07:17] you you rule it now
[1:07:20] not slaves to sin no more
[1:07:22] you've been absolutely free
[1:07:25] but not just free not free to run from
[1:07:28] and but to free to control it
[1:07:31] are you with me yes sir so when that
[1:07:35] spirit of fear tries to get on you you
[1:07:37] have the power to rule that thing when
[1:07:40] the spirit of pornography gets upon you
[1:07:42] you have the spirit or the power Amen to
[1:07:45] bring that Spirit into subjection amen
[1:07:48] when when when unbelief tries to get a
[1:07:51] hold of you and starts tells you uh
[1:07:53] telling you that you can't be healed you
[1:07:55] have the very power to control that
[1:07:58] thing and to shut that Spirit up
[1:08:02] yes sir I just believe that you even as
[1:08:05] Believers as the Overcomer has power
[1:08:07] amen over your lost loved ones
[1:08:10] you parents that overcoming you've got
[1:08:13] the power amen over that child that
[1:08:15] wayward child
[1:08:16] do you believe that well I believe it
[1:08:19] amen because you it's it's your
[1:08:21] understanding amen you say well I try to
[1:08:24] talk to that child I try to talk talk
[1:08:26] talk and they ain't listening I don't
[1:08:27] care it's a spirit amen that is blind or
[1:08:30] deafening their ears from what you're
[1:08:33] trying to tell them that you have the
[1:08:35] power over that spirit amen to cast that
[1:08:37] thing out
[1:08:40] overcomer
[1:08:41] see the Overcomer is not passive
[1:08:45] he's not just living life happy-go-lucky
[1:08:47] with that attitude he's a warrior he's
[1:08:51] not that Driftwood that brother Branham
[1:08:53] talked about that's just floating along
[1:08:55] getting caught up in all the trash
[1:08:57] can you say man remember what brother
[1:09:00] Branham said that God is not some old uh
[1:09:03] Dodie grandfather
[1:09:05] amen you know that that thinks that his
[1:09:09] grandchildren is perfect no matter what
[1:09:10] they do amen that's not God and the
[1:09:14] world puts put paints God as that now
[1:09:17] God will just accept you it don't matter
[1:09:18] what you what you do it don't matter how
[1:09:21] you behave it just don't matter amen
[1:09:23] you're just accepted in the kingdom of
[1:09:25] God anyway we just you know but God
[1:09:27] doesn't do that amen how you going to
[1:09:29] overcome can you say man how are we
[1:09:32] going to overcome we're going to just
[1:09:33] act like everybody amen you just can't
[1:09:35] do it look at the character of this
[1:09:37] generation look at the character of this
[1:09:39] world Amen but I'm telling you young
[1:09:41] people you're not like this generation
[1:09:44] they can be disrespectful to the law but
[1:09:46] you're not part of that
[1:09:49] can you say Amen they can do whatever
[1:09:51] they want to but but you're an overcomer
[1:09:54] amen that's right see so brother Brown
[1:09:56] said God is a father he's a father of
[1:09:58] righteousness of Correction and love is
[1:10:02] always corrective ain't that right amen
[1:10:06] so so it's not that you know God just
[1:10:09] loves you and so you just do whatever
[1:10:10] you want to do and and and and and and
[1:10:12] you you you'll go to heaven amen and and
[1:10:16] that's so sad you know uh uh that that
[1:10:18] that that that people are are painting
[1:10:21] uh that and and people are being
[1:10:22] deceived because that's not true it it
[1:10:25] belongs to the Overcomer the Rapture
[1:10:28] belongs to them that overcome
[1:10:30] uh yes sir
[1:10:33] it does Amen Jesus said the Kingdom of
[1:10:36] Heaven suffereth violence and the
[1:10:38] violent take it by force you realize
[1:10:40] you've got to fight the devil every day
[1:10:42] of your life
[1:10:43] you'll always have a sticky nature but
[1:10:45] you got to bring that nature under
[1:10:46] control
[1:10:48] can you say amen I know it gets tiring
[1:10:50] fighting but you've got to fight anyways
[1:10:53] God's counting on you amen the previous
[1:10:56] ages are captain on you brother shamaya

[1:11:03] just I just seem like I'm always making
[1:11:04] a mistake keep fighting
[1:11:07] ain't that right amen I'd rather you
[1:11:10] fight than just lay down let the devil
[1:11:11] whip you
[1:11:14] ain't that Ryan he may throw a punch
[1:11:16] every now and then but you know the
[1:11:18] battle's over you know you won the war
[1:11:21] it's already written You've Won
[1:11:26] ain't that right
[1:11:28] yes sir
[1:11:29] brother Brown talks about that log
[1:11:32] and he's seen in the woods that big old
[1:11:34] tree
[1:11:34] laying there in the water
[1:11:37] and he said you know he said I walked
[1:11:39] over there and looked strong looked
[1:11:41] great
[1:11:42] on the outside he said when I jumped on
[1:11:44] it big old piece of it just chunk of it
[1:11:46] just fell off
[1:11:47] you know and and and he said boy you
[1:11:50] know what what was it he said he'd been
[1:11:52] laying there dead so long
[1:11:55] until it was rotten on the inside
[1:11:57] he said the life had gone out of it and
[1:12:00] made it worse than ever when it was laid
[1:12:03] in the branch where the water was ain't
[1:12:05] that right and then he says this
[1:12:07] Christians are becoming that way they're
[1:12:10] becoming so soft they're becoming so
[1:12:12] rotten they're becoming so Dody a man he
[1:12:16] said they've been dead in sin and
[1:12:17] trespasses so long till they become
[1:12:20] Dodie and they can't hold no weight at
[1:12:23] all give them a little trial and they
[1:12:25] fall apart give them a little something
[1:12:27] Amen to test them amen and they don't
[1:12:29] know what to do with it God will give
[1:12:31] God will shake a church God will shake a
[1:12:34] home God will shake a a people God will
[1:12:36] shake an individual amen because God
[1:12:38] doesn't want no panty waste individuals
[1:12:41] amen claiming to make it to heaven and
[1:12:44] God just sitting there accepting without
[1:12:45] no fight now I'm going to tell you
[1:12:47] something church I wouldn't even want to
[1:12:49] make it to Heaven if I can't fight my
[1:12:51] battles if I had no battles to fight if
[1:12:54] I had nothing to overcome I wouldn't
[1:12:56] want a man to make take it to heaven and
[1:12:58] hear all their stories of how they were
[1:13:01] fed to the Lions they were burned at the
[1:13:03] stake and yet they didn't deny God one
[1:13:05] bit can you say man amen let me have the
[1:13:08] battles but God helped me to overcome
[1:13:11] them help me to overcome them
[1:13:13] televisions help me to overcome that
[1:13:15] pornography I'm not saying I'm part of
[1:13:17] that I'm just trying I'm just mentioning
[1:13:19] there's things that people need to
[1:13:21] overcome and you've got to overcome if
[1:13:24] you're going to make it in this rapture
[1:13:27] overcome hard feelings overcome the
[1:13:30] arguments overcome the fashion and the
[1:13:32] fact overcome the pleasures of this
[1:13:34] world overcome materialistic things
[1:13:36] overcome it all
[1:13:41] can you say Amen
[1:13:43] see they've been dead and sinned
[1:13:45] trespassed so long till they become Doty
[1:13:48] they can't hold any weight they don't
[1:13:50] know what overcoming means
[1:13:55] and you say Amen
[1:13:58] you can be stuck
[1:13:59] at the at the speed bump all you want
[1:14:01] and just be stuck there
[1:14:03] be stuck at the roadblock
[1:14:06] and your life will never tell any
[1:14:08] difference your testimony will never
[1:14:10] speak any different than where you're at
[1:14:13] but the moment you start breaking down
[1:14:16] them roadblocks breaking down them
[1:14:18] barriers breaking down and moving past
[1:14:20] you watch your testimony start speaking
[1:14:23] of Advance if you're advancing in God
[1:14:26] your testimony will speak of it if
[1:14:28] you're advancing in God your life will
[1:14:30] speak of it can you say Amen if you're
[1:14:32] advancing in God your very actions will
[1:14:35] speak of it can you say man if someone
[1:14:37] is just sitting backslid I know they're
[1:14:40] not overcoming they're at a stop steal
[1:14:43] and they're dying and what they need to
[1:14:45] do is start overcoming amen and start
[1:14:48] moving on and advancing in the message
[1:14:51] of the hour
[1:14:53] praise the Lord
[1:14:54] you believe it
[1:14:56] now brother Brown said you take a
[1:14:58] Christian that's supposed to be a
[1:14:59] Christian let the life of God go from
[1:15:01] him and the experience the joy of
[1:15:04] serving Christ and living in a church
[1:15:05] where such is going on he rottens
[1:15:08] everybody say he rottens twice as quick
[1:15:11] see living right under so if we're
[1:15:14] trying to follow the message of the hour
[1:15:15] or at least this part of the message we
[1:15:19] should live constantly in the Life of
[1:15:21] Christ because if you don't you lay
[1:15:23] around and know that these things that
[1:15:26] you're supposed to do and don't do it
[1:15:27] see the Bible says he that knoweth to do
[1:15:30] good and doeth it not to him is sin so I
[1:15:33] want to tell you something God has given
[1:15:34] us the privilege of coming in the
[1:15:36] message of the hour but with that
[1:15:38] message you got to remember this is the
[1:15:40] only message that will tell you the
[1:15:41] truth this is the only message that's
[1:15:43] got all the truth so that means that we
[1:15:46] are a people that cannot have excuses we
[1:15:49] are a people a man that is without
[1:15:51] excuse whatsoever amen we know what to
[1:15:54] do we know what God expects of us can
[1:15:57] you say amen amen God doesn't want you
[1:15:59] sitting around talking down to God
[1:16:01] doesn't want you sitting around in the
[1:16:03] glooms and the and and and moaning in a
[1:16:06] groaning God wants you to take that
[1:16:08] gospel take that promise and put it to
[1:16:10] action I can't and I will amen it's mine
[1:16:14] amen every promise of God Is Mine act
[1:16:18] upon it talk on it think about it and
[1:16:21] you'll see something happening
[1:16:25] so so now listen he that knoweth to do
[1:16:28] good and doeth it not to him it's sin
[1:16:30] then you become Dodie everybody say
[1:16:33] Dodie rotten we don't want to be rottens
[1:16:37] rotten rotten Christians
[1:16:40] we don't want to be Dodie Christians he
[1:16:42] said but you become Dodie rotten when
[1:16:44] you're separated from the life of God so
[1:16:47] strive everybody say strive
[1:16:49] strive with all that's in you
[1:16:54] don't don't don't be passive about this
[1:16:56] be very sincere strive with all that's
[1:16:59] in you to stay in the Life of Christ
[1:17:01] that you be fruit bearing can you say
[1:17:05] man so as we've said so many times it's
[1:17:07] this age that we're living in the most
[1:17:09] awfulest age sinful age greatest sinful
[1:17:13] Age The Prophet said than ever before
[1:17:15] there's more sin in this age than ever
[1:17:17] before it's all around us he says this
[1:17:20] the powers of Satan is many times harder
[1:17:23] to fight against here in this age than
[1:17:26] it was in any other age now I've really
[1:17:29] thought of that now Church think of the
[1:17:31] age that God has placed you in amen the
[1:17:33] powers of darkness is more harder to
[1:17:36] fight in this age than any other age
[1:17:38] they were burned to the stake they were
[1:17:40] fed to the Lions they were flayed alive
[1:17:42] they were sold into Sunder and all that
[1:17:45] but it doesn't compare to the age that
[1:17:47] you're living in they overcome and yet
[1:17:49] God says there's going to be an
[1:17:51] overcomer in this age today do you
[1:17:53] believe that now amen and yet the
[1:17:55] prophet is telling us the powers of
[1:17:58] Satan is many times harder to fight amen
[1:18:02] here in this age than it was in any age
[1:18:05] why the enemy has come in the name of
[1:18:08] the church amen that's right and it's so
[1:18:11] deceiving it's the greatest age of
[1:18:14] deception Amen to where a Christian now
[1:18:17] the name Christian people can be
[1:18:19] Christians and still watching their
[1:18:21] movies they can be Christians and still
[1:18:23] amen are looking at the filth they can
[1:18:25] be Christians and still swearing to God
[1:18:27] they can be Christians and still
[1:18:29] lighting up cigarettes and Vapors and
[1:18:31] marijuana and all of that stuff amen and
[1:18:34] see that thing is trying to get on us
[1:18:36] amen maybe we do not make you go out and
[1:18:39] drink but maybe you set there as a
[1:18:41] church member without a real experience
[1:18:44] with God where you can't believe God
[1:18:46] anymore amen when you're tested amen and
[1:18:49] you're facing uh uh impossible
[1:18:51] situations let me ask you do you have
[1:18:54] the faith to look and say I know God
[1:18:56] will I know God will regardless of the
[1:19:01] situation
[1:19:03] I hope I'm making sense to you
[1:19:09] I'm gonna have to be overcomer
[1:19:12] Jesus said the deception would be so
[1:19:14] close
[1:19:15] that even the elect would be deceived
[1:19:17] if
[1:19:19] it were possible
[1:19:21] now brother Brown said this
[1:19:23] people so live they they can live a
[1:19:25] clean life holy life not be sinful
[1:19:28] adulterers
[1:19:29] drinkers liars and gamblers
[1:19:31] they can live above that and still not
[1:19:33] with it
[1:19:34] amen
[1:19:37] so
[1:19:40] the sins don't don't mean
[1:19:43] that you're smoking you're drinking and
[1:19:45] looking at the pornography and
[1:19:48] and whatever the
[1:19:50] in got all these women's and strip clubs
[1:19:53] and
[1:19:54] you can live above all of that
[1:19:57] go to church
[1:19:58] and still not be with it
[1:20:01] and you say man
[1:20:03] now again Jesus spoke of the elect
[1:20:06] that's not going to be deceived
[1:20:08] now one thing about this brother Brown
[1:20:10] said this is the age of life
[1:20:12] everybody say this is the age of life
[1:20:16] the personal life
[1:20:18] of Christ
[1:20:19] can you say man
[1:20:21] now look Luke 11 24 when the unclean
[1:20:25] spirit is gone out of a man he walketh
[1:20:27] through Dry places seeking rest and
[1:20:29] finding none he saith I'll return unto
[1:20:32] my house once I came out and when he
[1:20:35] cometh he findeth it swept and garnished
[1:20:37] then go with he and taketh to him seven
[1:20:41] other Spirits more wicked than himself
[1:20:43] and they enter in and dwell there and
[1:20:47] the last state of that man is worse than
[1:20:49] the first
[1:20:50] now you know what that's saying that's
[1:20:53] why this age is the worst age ever now
[1:20:57] brother Branham Likens that to the
[1:20:59] church he said that's exactly what the
[1:21:01] church has done Baptist Methodist and
[1:21:04] those who believed in sanctification see
[1:21:06] then Jesus said the unclean spirit that
[1:21:08] went out returns back to this Church's
[1:21:10] body and finds the House Garner swept
[1:21:13] clean living Pure Clean lives right
[1:21:17] see all right he says but then if that
[1:21:20] house isn't filled occupied then he
[1:21:22] comes in with seven other evil demons
[1:21:25] worse than he was and the last stage of
[1:21:29] this place is seven times worse than it
[1:21:32] was at the first place they had been
[1:21:34] better to stay Lutheran than it would
[1:21:37] have been to receive the light and to
[1:21:39] follow it see or and fail to follow it
[1:21:42] so will the Pentecostal see you know
[1:21:45] what I mean the house is garnished ain't
[1:21:48] that right so many churches he goes on
[1:21:51] to talk about how many churches Holiness
[1:21:53] churches and all that they won't even
[1:21:55] say holy ghost they're afraid to say
[1:21:57] holy ghost say they say holy spirit
[1:21:59] ain't that right amen and and and we
[1:22:02] know that Holy Ghost holy spirit is the
[1:22:04] same thing amen but Brethren Brown said
[1:22:06] they won't say holy ghost because they
[1:22:08] don't want to identify themselves with
[1:22:10] Pentecostals they don't want to be
[1:22:13] identified with them tongue-speaking
[1:22:15] people and that's the Holy Spirit itself
[1:22:17] ain't that right so he says notice the
[1:22:20] enemy that went out under sanctification
[1:22:23] that was washed out returned back and
[1:22:26] found the house not filled with the Holy
[1:22:29] Spirit now the state of the church is
[1:22:31] joined with the league of churches with
[1:22:33] the World Council of churches and it's a
[1:22:36] state now that connects it with Roman
[1:22:38] Catholicism and all the rest of it and
[1:22:41] now it's seven times worse than it was
[1:22:45] when it come out of Lutheranism ain't
[1:22:47] that right the churches in this age are
[1:22:50] seven times worse and they're all
[1:22:52] uniting with with uh the mama
[1:22:56] Catholicism ain't that right so so we
[1:22:59] know that there's something that's
[1:23:00] driving them people doing that there's
[1:23:02] driving them organizations there's
[1:23:04] driving them ministers to to tell the
[1:23:06] people it's okay uh uh let's go back
[1:23:08] let's let's take all the walls down
[1:23:10] let's let's tear down our barriers and
[1:23:12] we're all one we're it's a demon that is
[1:23:15] talking and it's showing you a man that
[1:23:17] that man that church that religion
[1:23:20] organization they're seven times worse
[1:23:22] than what it was in Luther's day ain't
[1:23:25] that right so now now he goes after this
[1:23:29] layout of sin Church age has received
[1:23:31] the Holy Spirit and with the knowledge
[1:23:33] and the spirit of God within it what
[1:23:36] does it do it denies the works of God
[1:23:39] and calls it an evil work ain't that
[1:23:42] right we know the Holy Spirit fell on on
[1:23:45] Azusa Street we know what happened there
[1:23:47] amen but now when God would send a
[1:23:50] prophet amen and and and show himself as
[1:23:53] the same Melchizedek as before Abraham
[1:23:56] would come in this day and he would
[1:23:58] begin to manifest himself amen the
[1:24:00] people doesn't want it they they they
[1:24:02] they they they they they they they just
[1:24:03] don't want it ain't that right and so he
[1:24:06] says see there is where Christ is put
[1:24:08] out of his own church it never showed
[1:24:11] him in the church until it come to
[1:24:13] laodicea and when he got to laodicea he
[1:24:16] had been put out of his church trying to
[1:24:19] get back in amen see justification never
[1:24:22] put him back in sanctification never put
[1:24:25] him back in ain't that right it was the
[1:24:28] baptism of the Holy Ghost that put him
[1:24:31] in the the people ain't that right but
[1:24:34] they turned him out when he began to
[1:24:37] show himself as the same yesterday today
[1:24:40] and forever the people didn't want that
[1:24:43] they called it a devil they called it
[1:24:45] whatever and and it's because they
[1:24:48] didn't he Christ didn't agree with their
[1:24:51] their organizations and their rituals
[1:24:53] and and all of these things ain't that
[1:24:55] right so the life the same life that was
[1:24:59] in the beginning and in Christ amen when
[1:25:03] when he that life began to manifest
[1:25:06] itself
[1:25:07] they didn't want it they turned it out
[1:25:09] can you say man now look at them they're
[1:25:12] dead
[1:25:13] rotten
[1:25:14] seven times worse than when they started
[1:25:17] ain't that right so we can understand
[1:25:19] why brother Brown stay in the life
[1:25:22] stay in the life
[1:25:23] amen stay with that life whatever you do
[1:25:26] stay in the life can you say amen amen
[1:25:29] that's right and where is the life we're
[1:25:31] the signs and wonders are amen where
[1:25:33] Christ himself is
[1:25:36] ain't that right yes sir see so we find
[1:25:41] uh uh when you separate yourself from
[1:25:43] the life of Jesus Christ amen then you
[1:25:46] become rotten and Dodie and what happens
[1:25:48] you'll never be able to overcome
[1:25:52] you cannot and I'll say this way you
[1:25:54] cannot overcome just by knowing the
[1:25:56] Bible
[1:25:57] you can read this Bible year around and
[1:26:00] and you still can't won't that don't
[1:26:01] mean you can overcome you don't overcome
[1:26:03] by knowing all the quotes you don't
[1:26:05] overcome but you gotta stay in the life
[1:26:09] ain't that right a man's eight now you
[1:26:12] can still be religious but not an
[1:26:14] overcomer now we don't want to be just
[1:26:16] religious we want to be an overcomer and
[1:26:19] you say man and I'm going to tell you
[1:26:20] this I'll tell you what amen God doesn't
[1:26:22] maybe always knock on your your you know
[1:26:25] our little brain and say okay this is me
[1:26:27] now I'm going to see what you're going
[1:26:28] to do but God always put you through
[1:26:30] tests I don't care what it is it could
[1:26:33] be on your job it could be at your home
[1:26:35] it could be you know uh uh uh uh with
[1:26:38] with husband or wife it could be with
[1:26:40] children it could be whatever God will
[1:26:42] always put us to the test to see how we
[1:26:45] respond we don't always now we're not
[1:26:47] always just to respond in Christian ways
[1:26:50] at the church
[1:26:52] great we ought to be Christian at home
[1:26:54] we ought to be Christian at the work
[1:26:56] good job we ought to be Christian and
[1:26:57] whatever and we've got to be able to
[1:26:59] know when the test comes and how to
[1:27:03] respond to that
[1:27:05] [Music]
[1:27:06] and you say Amen talking about
[1:27:09] overcoming
[1:27:13] praise the Lord I hope it's all right
[1:27:16] so you can't overcome so again the
[1:27:19] prophet said we should live constantly
[1:27:21] in the Life of Christ
[1:27:24] so strive with all that's in you to stay
[1:27:28] in the life so when you hear that Jesus
[1:27:31] come unto me come come out of her my
[1:27:33] people why they denied the life they've
[1:27:35] rejected the life come to the life get
[1:27:38] out of that which is dead and rotten and
[1:27:40] Dody don't get in that atmosphere you
[1:27:43] you'll you'll die there can you say Amen
[1:27:45] there's no overcoming power in them
[1:27:49] denominations there is no overcoming I
[1:27:52] want to just say it there's no
[1:27:53] overcoming in Holiness churches
[1:27:56] it doesn't matter how Holiness you dress
[1:27:58] if you're away from the life you'll
[1:28:01] never be able to overcome anyways
[1:28:05] this is the age of life this is the
[1:28:08] token time
[1:28:11] ain't that right and the token must be
[1:28:13] on display
[1:28:15] and you know what the token display is
[1:28:17] you overcoming
[1:28:20] then you say amen that's right now so
[1:28:24] when we're looking at this life because
[1:28:25] brother Brown said stay in the Life stay
[1:28:27] constantly in that life don't separate
[1:28:29] from that life so he's letting us know
[1:28:31] the life is important
[1:28:35] good to have morals it's good to have
[1:28:37] Holiness it's good to have standards but
[1:28:40] for life
[1:28:41] don't let the life leave you
[1:28:44] stay in the life can you say Amen
[1:28:48] oh Lord have mercy this life can't
[1:28:51] destroy this this life can't thrive
[1:28:54] you feeding off them movies
[1:28:58] life can't this life can't thrive
[1:29:02] feeding off all the worldly junk
[1:29:06] can you say Amen just can't do it just
[1:29:09] can't
[1:29:11] so now this life that we're speaking of
[1:29:14] is a greater life
[1:29:15] than this Earthly life
[1:29:18] ain't that right this Mortal life has
[1:29:20] sin and Corruption it has death in it
[1:29:23] and comes to in its end now we're
[1:29:24] talking about an overcomer now we're not
[1:29:26] talking about religion not religious
[1:29:28] folks we're talking about Overcomer
[1:29:30] they'll overcome her now this natural
[1:29:32] life this you know you can serve God by
[1:29:35] natural ability natural conception
[1:29:38] natural intellect natural everything
[1:29:41] um
[1:29:41] but you'll die
[1:29:43] because that's not the life he's talking
[1:29:45] about
[1:29:46] this life is a life that don't end
[1:29:49] can you say man amen that which is
[1:29:52] natural dies that which is carnal dies
[1:29:55] it cannot last but we're talking about
[1:29:58] another life that is pure
[1:30:00] ain't that right a life that is superior
[1:30:03] to everything else might have a genius
[1:30:07] mind but you're gonna die
[1:30:09] and all your accomplishments will die
[1:30:11] with you
[1:30:13] there's no lasting value to it ain't
[1:30:15] that right but this life that I'm
[1:30:18] talking about is an endless life
[1:30:20] yes sir and the the Overcomer thing of
[1:30:23] it the Overcomer has access to this life
[1:30:28] ain't that right you realize Jesus had
[1:30:31] this life
[1:30:32] and he was an overcomer
[1:30:34] he did not overcome by natural life he
[1:30:37] didn't overcome by natural conception he
[1:30:40] didn't overcome by natural intellect he
[1:30:43] overcome by the life of God
[1:30:45] that's right see he was an overcomer and
[1:30:48] he said as I have overcome the world so
[1:30:50] you shall overcome the world
[1:30:51] so every Overcomer is just like he is
[1:30:54] can you say Amen as I have overcome so
[1:30:58] that means to tell us that as I have
[1:31:00] overcome you shall overcome he's telling
[1:31:02] you you're made of the same product
[1:31:06] hello
[1:31:08] you're made of the same product so it
[1:31:10] doesn't matter to him that you're in the
[1:31:12] most evil age ever the most deceptive
[1:31:14] age as I have overcome so shall you
[1:31:19] ain't that right
[1:31:21] yes sir see so that's why he didn't see
[1:31:24] corruption because the life he had
[1:31:27] raised him up from the dead and the
[1:31:29] Overcomer will never see that corruption
[1:31:33] I'll just say it the Overcomer will
[1:31:35] never be rotten and Dodie
[1:31:38] damn
[1:31:39] because it's a life that is endless
[1:31:42] ain't that right no to see the Overcomer
[1:31:45] is life of his life power of his power
[1:31:49] bone of his bone right she is him
[1:31:54] yes sir if the spirit that raised up
[1:31:56] Christ from the dead dwell in you he
[1:31:59] that raised up Christ from the dead
[1:32:01] that same spirit will also Quicken your
[1:32:04] mortal body
[1:32:06] you believe it now notice first John 5 4
[1:32:09] for whosoever is born everybody say he
[1:32:12] is born
[1:32:13] of the world
[1:32:15] of God
[1:32:17] I didn't give you those two these two
[1:32:19] scriptures but whosoever is born of God
[1:32:25] overcomes the world
[1:32:27] and this is the victory that overcometh
[1:32:29] the world even our faith
[1:32:32] ain't that right yes sir so the
[1:32:34] Overcomers got an undying faith
[1:32:37] notice first John 4 4 you are of God
[1:32:41] little children
[1:32:44] you're born of God you are of God and
[1:32:47] have overcome them
[1:32:49] why because greater is he that is in you
[1:32:52] than he that is in this world
[1:32:54] then you say Amen so the Overcomer is
[1:32:58] made in the same likeness as Jesus made
[1:33:01] from the same material as Jesus is
[1:33:05] do you believe that
[1:33:06] now if you allow me some more time for
[1:33:09] just a few moments according to Hebrews
[1:33:12] 7 17 Jesus Christ was made after the
[1:33:15] similitude of Melchizedek which was not
[1:33:19] made after the con the law of a carnal
[1:33:21] commandment
[1:33:24] but after the power of an endless life
[1:33:28] what was he made after about the power
[1:33:31] of an endless life then you say amen I
[1:33:34] went and looked up endless it means not
[1:33:37] subject to destruction
[1:33:40] Jesus wasn't subject to destruction
[1:33:42] that's why he could say destroy this
[1:33:44] body and in three days I will raise it
[1:33:46] up
[1:33:47] ain't that right now let's go on here in
[1:33:51] in in in in in of course in Hebrews the
[1:33:54] seventh chapter there Paul is showing
[1:33:56] the difference between the little
[1:33:57] levitical priesthood and and and Jesus
[1:34:01] who is our high priest ain't that right
[1:34:03] he's showing that there is a difference
[1:34:06] and I'm going to just dwell on that for
[1:34:08] a month there is a difference
[1:34:11] can you say Amen why he was not made
[1:34:14] after them
[1:34:16] he was not made after a carnal
[1:34:18] commandment he was not made by law
[1:34:21] he was made by the power of an endless
[1:34:24] life
[1:34:27] yes sir now notice Hebrews 7 15 and it
[1:34:31] is far more evident for that after the
[1:34:34] similitude of Melchizedek their ariseth
[1:34:37] another priest
[1:34:39] speaking of Jesus Christ ain't that
[1:34:42] right
[1:34:43] now see so now this isn't not meaning
[1:34:45] that he was just another priest as the
[1:34:48] ones before him there ariseth another
[1:34:51] priest okay yeah right we we've had
[1:34:54] priests after priest for all generations
[1:34:55] but no that's not what Paul is saying
[1:34:58] amen he's showing that this is a
[1:35:00] different priest
[1:35:02] ain't that right he was a stranger in
[1:35:05] the house of Aaron
[1:35:07] the word arises because he says here
[1:35:10] Paul says there arise if another priest
[1:35:13] and the word arises means to be brought
[1:35:15] forth in an extraordinary manner
[1:35:20] he wasn't brought forth through the gene
[1:35:22] seed of of levitical of Leviticus of
[1:35:25] Levi
[1:35:27] hello
[1:35:29] this arising
[1:35:31] is an extraordinary
[1:35:34] see he was brought forth in an
[1:35:37] extraordinary manner see so there arises
[1:35:40] another priest so so this isn't meaning
[1:35:44] again that Jesus was just another
[1:35:46] continuation of what had been
[1:35:49] and I want to say this we have had
[1:35:52] Church
[1:35:55] brother Brown says churches churches
[1:35:57] Brides brides
[1:35:59] but I want to set this weight there
[1:36:01] ariseth another church
[1:36:04] can you say Amen there arises another
[1:36:07] bride
[1:36:11] oh my that's right there arises can you
[1:36:14] say man in other words she's brought
[1:36:16] forth in that extraordinary manner
[1:36:19] [Applause]
[1:36:21] we've had churches churches Brides
[1:36:23] brides revivals revivals but there
[1:36:25] ariseth another bride
[1:36:28] can you say Amen
[1:36:32] well it's true
[1:36:34] so here we find a man that that see this
[1:36:38] church this Overcomer this body that is
[1:36:41] standing here today of Jesus Christ amen
[1:36:44] is is is not just another typical church
[1:36:47] that we've had in the previous ages
[1:36:50] hello
[1:36:52] this just doesn't just have the
[1:36:54] mechanics that has also got the Dynamics
[1:36:57] do you believe that she's got both
[1:37:00] mechanics and Dynamics
[1:37:02] this is a different Church
[1:37:07] that's right
[1:37:09] and with all the previous churches and
[1:37:11] all the previous revivals they've died
[1:37:13] where's the lutherans to date dead
[1:37:16] where's the Methodist today they're dead
[1:37:18] where's the Baptist today they're dead
[1:37:19] they once live but they're dead
[1:37:22] but this bride this church will never
[1:37:24] die
[1:37:26] she's made after the power of an endless
[1:37:28] life
[1:37:32] and you say man
[1:37:34] so every individual that makes up this
[1:37:38] bride is the is the Overcomer now notice
[1:37:40] Paul said there Rise is another priest
[1:37:43] who is made not after the law of a
[1:37:47] carnal commandment but after the power
[1:37:49] of an endless life
[1:37:51] for he testifies thou art a priest
[1:37:54] Forever After the order of Melchizedek
[1:37:56] for there is verily a disannoying of the
[1:37:59] Commandment going before for the
[1:38:01] weakness and unprofitableness thereof
[1:38:04] for the law made nothing perfect but the
[1:38:08] bringing in of a better hope did
[1:38:11] by which we draw nigh unto God can you
[1:38:15] say Amen so I want to put it this way
[1:38:17] the rising of Christ
[1:38:19] the arising of another priest put an end
[1:38:22] to the levitical priesthood
[1:38:27] showing that he was not part of that
[1:38:29] levitical priesthood
[1:38:31] he was another priest brought forth in
[1:38:33] an extraordinary manner
[1:38:35] and he put back levitical priesthood the
[1:38:38] law to rest
[1:38:40] God have mercy
[1:38:42] then you say amen and why did he do it
[1:38:45] because the levitical priesthood that
[1:38:48] law that thing had no power to make
[1:38:51] perfect
[1:38:52] it had no power to bring him uh in God's
[1:38:56] mind to completion
[1:39:01] you say Amen
[1:39:03] so he put it an end to that which was
[1:39:05] weak and didn't have the ability to
[1:39:07] perfect
[1:39:08] ain't that right
[1:39:09] so as one writer says the levitical
[1:39:12] priesthood was set aside for one
[1:39:14] infinitely Superior which was set up by
[1:39:17] God himself
[1:39:19] can you say Amen the power of an endless
[1:39:22] life
[1:39:23] in other words there would be no end to
[1:39:25] him
[1:39:26] amen one priest would rise and then he
[1:39:29] would die at another priest but this
[1:39:32] priest there's no end to him
[1:39:34] can you say Amen One Church would come
[1:39:37] and a church would die a church would
[1:39:39] rise a church would die but this church
[1:39:41] you amen that you're a part of will
[1:39:43] never die
[1:39:46] and you say amen and I got to tell you
[1:39:49] this revival that we're part of will
[1:39:51] never die
[1:39:53] it will never die can you say Amen
[1:39:55] history records of all other revivals
[1:39:58] dying after a few years but this is a
[1:40:00] miracle
[1:40:01] this is a paradox but you're not of just
[1:40:05] another church you're made after the
[1:40:08] power of an endless life
[1:40:13] Luther couldn't bring us to perfection
[1:40:18] hello
[1:40:19] all the church ages they had no power to
[1:40:22] bring God's thoughts to to completion
[1:40:26] but here we are
[1:40:28] what God had in his thoughts
[1:40:30] are being manifested right here
[1:40:33] it's time to go home
[1:40:36] I hope this is all right
[1:40:38] there would be no end to him
[1:40:40] he was made after the power of an
[1:40:42] endless life
[1:40:43] what was he was a predestinated seed of
[1:40:45] God do you believe that predestinated
[1:40:49] before the foundation of the world and
[1:40:51] so here we find that the error the Aaron
[1:40:54] priesthood the levitical priesthood was
[1:40:56] set up according to the law of fleshly
[1:40:58] Commandments
[1:41:00] amen but Jesus was not set up according
[1:41:02] to the law
[1:41:05] amen he abolished the law he set that
[1:41:07] aside he put that to silence can you say
[1:41:10] Amen now Ephesians 2 13 but now in
[1:41:13] Christ Jesus ye who sometimes were far
[1:41:16] off are made nigh by the blood of Jesus
[1:41:19] Christ for he is our peace who hath made
[1:41:22] both one and hath broken down the middle
[1:41:24] wall of partition between us having
[1:41:27] abolished everybody say having abolished
[1:41:29] in his flesh the enmity even the law of
[1:41:34] Commandments contained in the ordinance
[1:41:36] for to make in himself of Twain one new
[1:41:39] man Soul Making Peace ain't that right
[1:41:42] no other priesthood could do this but
[1:41:44] he's the one that done it he abolished
[1:41:46] sin he abolished the iniquity he
[1:41:49] abolished it all to where you are
[1:41:51] absolutely free there's no guilt there's
[1:41:53] no condemnation it's not putting you the
[1:41:56] the gospel is not putting you back in
[1:41:58] prison again like the law did but it's
[1:42:01] telling you you have been pardoned by
[1:42:03] the blood of Jesus Christ you are no
[1:42:05] longer longer in the pawn shop amen you
[1:42:07] are now at fellowship and Oneness with
[1:42:10] God again
[1:42:16] and he didn't come after the order of
[1:42:18] Aaron he didn't come to that lineage
[1:42:21] see the little levitical priesthood was
[1:42:24] a lineage of priest father and son right
[1:42:28] and then then it goes down to son
[1:42:30] grandson great-grandson and on and on
[1:42:33] and on it was a lineage but Jesus didn't
[1:42:36] come through the lineage
[1:42:37] he was made after the power of an
[1:42:39] endless life
[1:42:40] can you say man oh do you love him
[1:42:43] predestinated before the world ever
[1:42:46] began and I'll be honest I'll tell you
[1:42:48] this as the musicians come our Christian
[1:42:51] walk has nothing to do with our
[1:42:52] genealogy it has nothing to do with our
[1:42:55] natural family tree it has nothing to do
[1:42:57] with what what Mom and Dad were it has
[1:43:00] nothing to do with what the pastor was
[1:43:02] it had nothing to do with whatever amen
[1:43:04] the church can fail the church can what
[1:43:06] whatever amen people can fail the
[1:43:08] preacher can fail mom and dad can fail
[1:43:10] deacons can fail but it doesn't affect
[1:43:12] me amen for I am made after the power of
[1:43:16] an endless life can you say man and I
[1:43:19] tell you what I don't care how bad it
[1:43:20] gets there's going to be an overcomer

[1:43:25] them Overcomers are just as you know

[1:43:28] energizing Energizer rabbit you know

[1:43:33] gone you give them whatever trial and
[1:43:35] they're just moving and keep them moving
[1:43:37] and keep them moving you'll never find
[1:43:39] them so discouraged words that to just
[1:43:42] give up that ain't gonna happen they're
[1:43:44] made after the power of an endless life
[1:43:46] they were brought forth in an
[1:43:49] extraordinary manner can you say man and
[1:43:52] I just know this this church is going to
[1:43:54] be completed and they that are waiting
[1:43:57] on us are going to come to Perfection
[1:43:59] because there is an overcomer in this
